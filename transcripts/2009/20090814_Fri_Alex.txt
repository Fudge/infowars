[00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:09.655]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.256]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.816]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:16.998]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:21.060]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.471]  Can't believe it's Friday.
[00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.691]  Just amazing.
[00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:42.754]  The weeks just flash by like the twinkling of an eye.
[00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:46.797]  Faster and faster and faster as we hurdle into the fall and winter.
[00:00:46.797 --> 00:01:02.627]  And whatever the globalists have planned for us, it's clear that they're planning something big, something really special for the Republic, in an attempt to ram through their new Bank of the World, their new global carbon tax, their socialized death care, their eugenics care.
[00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.871]  They're open borders, they're gun confiscation.
[00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:29.996]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know in the middle of 2008, the Pentagon announced in the Army Times, what we already knew years before, but just confirmed it, that 20,000 regular Army troops, brigades, homeland would patrol America and quote, pull triggers on American citizens during civil unrest, magically knowing what was coming in the future.
[00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:36.916]  Now they're announcing 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.739]  So, they go from 20,000 to 400,000.
[00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:53.891]  And I've repeatedly made the point, that's why they're trying to swell the military ranks, to have a million-person domestic auxiliary federal police force, and then around a half a million regular army.
[00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:56.072]  And they are gonna run every facet of your life.
[00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:59.635]  When you go to their drills, they are training to take your farms and ranches.
[00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:14.920]  First they tell you that they're going to try to fight Al-Qaeda, and just give up your rights to fight Al-Qaeda, and you say, yeah, you know, we're setting all this big federal takeover up to fight brown people 8,000 miles away, I guess it's okay.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.823]  You know, they ran the attacks from the caves, and Easter bunnies come down the chimney and put presents under the tree at Christmas time.
[00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:25.944]  It's all true.
[00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:28.005]  Chinese jet pilots are orbiting Pluto.
[00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:32.699]  And they lay Christmas eggs under the tree as well.
[00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.002]  So it's just, you know, completely made up, totally ridiculous.
[00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.224]  If you believe in the tooth fairy, fine.
[00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:40.705]  That Al Qaeda did 9-11.
[00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:48.670]  The point is, now they're saying homeland security is for the American people, and the number one threat is gun owners and returning veterans.
[00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.311]  That's official.
[00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:56.015]  And they want to use 400 military, 400,000 military, mainly felons and illegal aliens.
[00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:56.556]  That's the new
[00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.164]  Majority of the new force, the new force, the majority of the new forces they're getting are felons or illegal aliens.
[00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:13.771]  A true foreign army right here to bust the chops to make the American people submit.
[00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:17.694]  And so that's out of the Progressive magazine.
[00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:22.758]  And this is from a Pentagon announcement.
[00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.559]  So we're going to cover that.
[00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.301]  Also on the whole health care front,
[00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:36.539]  The White House is hiring people $500 a week to go out and be supporters of it, so that's cellular.
[00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:43.004]  And different private foundations and groups and others are also funding similar things, so we'll go over that.
[00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:50.451]  And they're equating protesting against Obama with fear for Obama's safety grows as hate groups thrive on radical backlash.
[00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:56.119]  So basically, you're a Klan member if you don't want to turn your guns in.
[00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:00.623]  Also, emails from public overload, White House website.
[00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:03.025]  The AP doesn't say whether it's pro or con.
[00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:07.429]  You know it's against the death care, the eugenics care.
[00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.371]  But again, shutting down the White House website.
[00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:14.495]  Senators exclude end-of-life provision from the bill, so they've struck that for now.
[00:04:16.032 --> 00:04:20.236]  The New York Times is saying the death panel rumor is made up by Republicans.
[00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:23.359]  Uh, no, it comes out of Tom Daschle's own book.
[00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:25.321]  I mean, come on, we know what goes on in England.
[00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:29.284]  We know what... I mean, we... It's in their own policies.
[00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:33.548]  Of course they say they're gonna not give people the medical tests they need and things.
[00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:34.309]  Rationing care.
[00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:36.371]  I mean, come on.
[00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:39.474]  That's why nobody believes anything you say, because you've been caught lying.
[00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:41.776]  You're saying we're the liars when you're the liars?
[00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:49.853]  And it comes out, actually, big insurance companies and Republican groups are quietly funding the health care takeover.
[00:04:49.853 --> 00:04:51.775]  They play to the same sheet of music.
[00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:52.656]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:58.144]  We'll tell you about the guest as well when we officially start the main transmission in T-minus three minutes.
[00:04:58.144 --> 00:04:59.145]  Big show today!
[00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.327]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:03.329]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:03.969]  Well, you should.
[00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.794]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:08.794 --> 00:05:09.614]  That's right.
[00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:18.282]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:19.623]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:20.764]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:26.948]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:33.852]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:39.376]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:40.837]  This is real.
[00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:41.897]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:48.762]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:50.442]  And get your free handgun.
[00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:52.803]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:56.504]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:05:56.504 --> 00:06:00.806]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:02.226]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:02.226 --> 00:06:05.047]  A new world order.
[00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:09.908]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:09.908 --> 00:06:12.769]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:15.550]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.931]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:26.043]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:34.517]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:38.399]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.961]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:42.122]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:42.902]  They're not after money.
[00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.203]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.164]  They're after power.
[00:06:45.164 --> 00:06:46.325]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:55.030]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.832]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:57.832 --> 00:06:58.973]  You have been warned.
[00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:06.743]  If you'd like to replace the ineffective and toxic cleaning products under your sink, you need to visit BioGreenClean.com.
[00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:14.084]  BioGreenClean is the first heavy-duty, all-natural, multi-purpose cleaner that outperforms every other competitive cleaning product on the market today.
[00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:22.766]  BioGreenClean is tough enough to take on the kitchen, the bathroom, your outdoor grill, and virtually anything in your car, home, boat, or office, yet is safe enough for your children and pets.
[00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:29.587]  BioGreenClean does not contain harmful chemical solvents, such as commonly used chemicals, butoxethanol, petroleum products,
[00:07:29.767 --> 00:07:30.087]  I think so.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:08.524]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.524 --> 00:08:19.251]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:22.873]  Well, we've got a huge jam-packed radio show today.
[00:08:22.873 --> 00:08:24.554]  I'm going to news blitz right now.
[00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:32.154]  Then we're going to open the phones up in the second, third, and fourth hour today.
[00:08:32.154 --> 00:08:36.259]  We have Stuart Rhodes joining us.
[00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:46.690]  He, of course, is a Yale Law School graduate, an Airborne Ranger, Special Forces,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.683]  And he started Oath Keepers, he worked in the congressional staff for Congressman Ron Paul, has an impeccable record.
[00:08:55.683 --> 00:09:09.149]  He was demonized as some type of vicious, murdering terrorist, along with myself, in the Southern Poverty Law Center's latest hit piece.
[00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:13.151]  I mean, it might as well be a death warrant on us.
[00:09:14.272 --> 00:09:18.254]  Might as well be a giant crosshairs painted on our backs.
[00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:22.875]  Their latest letter of mark is probably the most accurate way to describe it against us.
[00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:29.018]  So I wanted to go over that report today in the second hour with him.
[00:09:29.018 --> 00:09:30.118]  Very, very ominous.
[00:09:30.118 --> 00:09:35.901]  I've been explaining for months and months that if they launch a demonization of militias
[00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:41.777]  Well, what they do is they say, white supremacists, militias, gun owners.
[00:09:41.777 --> 00:09:53.681]  So see, first they say white supremacists, then they demonize militias by connecting them to white supremacists, then they demonize gun owners by connecting them to militias, and that's what the DHS reports do.
[00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:54.781]  And it's here.
[00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.082]  It's now happening.
[00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:59.023]  And I, of course, am their number one target.
[00:09:59.023 --> 00:10:00.083]  I do not enjoy that.
[00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:05.045]  It does make the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
[00:10:07.546 --> 00:10:15.732]  Not pleasing, but at a certain level, it is gratifying.
[00:10:15.732 --> 00:10:31.722]  Emotionally, it is not pleasing or gratifying, but at a very, very cold level of my psyche, where we're waging war against the New World Order system and trying to expose these eugenicists parasites, these criminals, these wreckers.
[00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:35.165]  It is very satisfying because it means we're hurting them and having an effect.
[00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:39.306]  It lets me know I'm doing my job in a big way.
[00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:42.948]  When they turn loose, legions of COINTELPRO against me.
[00:10:42.948 --> 00:10:43.908]  Well, proof is in the pudding.
[00:10:43.908 --> 00:10:49.170]  Look at the fruits of what we bore, what the tree has produced.
[00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.332]  And I just want to commend my crew, everybody that runs the radio slash TV show.
[00:10:54.369 --> 00:11:08.799]  The sales people, the graphics folks, the video people, the webmasters, the writers, and you, the listeners who've spread the word and carried our videos across the planet, our articles, our films, our books, our materials, the guests we have on.
[00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.120]  This is a launch pad.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.621]  That's what we are.
[00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:16.004]  This radio show is a giant missile base, a missile factory.
[00:11:16.004 --> 00:11:18.205]  And we just fire missiles at the New World Order.
[00:11:18.205 --> 00:11:21.147]  Huge missiles in the Info War.
[00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:23.309]  And we train people to build more missile bases.
[00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:26.462]  We're really a missile base factory.
[00:11:26.462 --> 00:11:29.884]  We produce factories that make other missile bases.
[00:11:29.884 --> 00:11:31.884]  The more I think about it.
[00:11:31.884 --> 00:11:34.546]  And so, don't let the globalists distract you or divert you.
[00:11:34.546 --> 00:11:35.806]  You know you're a leader.
[00:11:35.806 --> 00:11:36.827]  You know you're good.
[00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:39.488]  You know you're fighting the New World Order.
[00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:43.270]  You know you can have success and have had success and that we've had success.
[00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:49.033]  And so just set up your own operation and start blasting the enemy in the info war.
[00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:53.275]  And mercilessly, mercilessly take them on.
[00:11:54.824 --> 00:11:59.726]  So let me run down what's coming up today and then I'm going to get into the news.
[00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:02.326]  Stuart Rhodes joining us.
[00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:08.188]  Bob Chapman coming on with his hourly visit, his weekly hourly visit on the economy and what's happening there.
[00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:10.109]  Boy, big developments there.
[00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:16.591]  And then we have a very interesting surprise guest scheduled in the last hour of the show today.
[00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:23.788]  And normally our surprise guests show up for the show, but this surprise guest didn't show up last week.
[00:12:23.788 --> 00:12:31.933]  We had another surprise guest that didn't show up yesterday, but that surprise guest is rescheduled for the third time for Monday.
[00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:37.156]  This surprise guest is scheduled for the second time today.
[00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:41.959]  You were going to tell me something?
[00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:43.680]  Yeah, yeah, Monday for the other surprise guest.
[00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:50.224]  So we'll just leave it at that.
[00:12:50.224 --> 00:12:53.727]  Folks, you know, normally when I have a surprise guest, they actually show up.
[00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:59.831]  But at this point, we're going to try to reschedule these guys one more time if they don't show up, and I won't be announcing it's a surprise guest.
[00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:01.152]  They'll just be on the show.
[00:13:01.152 --> 00:13:12.460]  I don't think we had a perfect batting average with surprise guests until as of late.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.183]  So, again, Stuart Rhodes, Bob Chapman, and then Alan Keyes.
[00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.674]  There, I just let out the surprise guest.
[00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:20.635]  We'll see if he actually shows up for the show today.
[00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:22.636]  I'm tired of saying surprise guest.
[00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:23.797]  He shows up, he shows up.
[00:13:23.797 --> 00:13:30.841]  I want to talk to him about a host of issues.
[00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:34.803]  That's the problem with having a surprise guest written down on a piece of paper in front of you.
[00:13:34.803 --> 00:13:36.324]  No longer a surprise.
[00:13:36.324 --> 00:13:37.364]  But I'm excited about that.
[00:13:37.364 --> 00:13:39.505]  Talk about a host of issues with the ambassador.
[00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:45.809]  If this isn't a counsellorship, where is the ambassador?
[00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:54.859]  Okay.
[00:13:54.859 --> 00:14:02.587]  I want to, I've got all this new top news, top story information to cover that's all very important.
[00:14:02.587 --> 00:14:14.878]  But I look at these headlines from yesterday that I spent some time on, but you can't just, it's almost a disservice if I come on air and I
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:26.482]  Mention these headlines, read a few paragraphs, and then don't ask callers to call in and comment on it, and don't make a big deal out of it.
[00:14:26.482 --> 00:14:32.844]  It actually desensitizes not just the listeners, but myself.
[00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:37.525]  And I really catch myself every day getting conditioned to accept all of this.
[00:14:37.525 --> 00:14:42.467]  I mean, I get up here and jump up and down and say, this is a big deal, this is bad, this is serious, we need to get angry.
[00:14:43.345 --> 00:14:59.899]  And certainly the public's getting upset and getting angry and getting motivated and getting in the streets and real issues of gun confiscation and martial law are now being discussed and forced inoculations are being discussed and cancer viruses in the new flu vaccine.
[00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.501]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:08.105]  But we need to get even more upset, more in the streets, more angry.
[00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:09.927]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:14.614]  And so some people accuse me of making a bigger deal out of things than they are.
[00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:17.437]  I mean, can we just pinch ourselves?
[00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:21.781]  They've got more than 15 bills introduced that effectively end the Second Amendment.
[00:15:21.781 --> 00:15:25.284]  And I've had Second Amendment groups on and read those bills ad nauseam.
[00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:31.810]  Go to Gun Owners of America and read their legislative updates if you're hiding under a rock somewhere and haven't been paying attention.
[00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.054]  And then you've got the media running a hoax saying none of those bills exist.
[00:15:37.506 --> 00:15:50.935]  And you've got them saying there isn't rationed care, and there isn't instant access to your bank accounts under this system, and there isn't... There's just so much going on.
[00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:55.298]  I cannot stress enough, everything is happening right now.
[00:15:55.298 --> 00:15:57.960]  This is the big New World Order move.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:07.066]  They are throwing everything, including the kitchen sink at us right now, and we need everybody active, everybody informed, and everybody out informing others.
[00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:15.050]  I mean, look at these headlines from yesterday.
[00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.232]  Congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[00:16:18.232 --> 00:16:19.233]  We're working on it.
[00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:35.823]  Congressman Paul Brown, in town halls, this is out of the Louisville newspapers and others, is saying mainstream news that they're going to use it as a cover for martial law.
[00:16:35.823 --> 00:16:38.685]  And then the National Governors Association saying the same thing.
[00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:41.429]  That's in the Associated Press.
[00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:45.250]  I mean, it's not Alex Jones saying this.
[00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.931]  It's the heads of the National Governors Association.
[00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.272]  The last head that they were scared of, they just shot down.
[00:16:51.272 --> 00:16:57.574]  For whatever reasons, they found something wrong in his background, a mistress, a girlfriend.
[00:16:57.574 --> 00:16:58.974]  I'm not saying that's good.
[00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:08.150]  The point is, it's nothing compared... I mean, Barney Frank can have little kids in his house with him running under, you know, slave brothels.
[00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.631]  I mean, and he doesn't get in trouble.
[00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:15.215]  But you start telling the feds you're not going to let him take over?
[00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:16.836]  You got a girlfriend in Argentina?
[00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:18.197]  It's over, folks.
[00:17:18.197 --> 00:17:19.738]  That's all over the news.
[00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:24.121]  Or Governor Spitzer exposing the banker scam and Goldman Sachs.
[00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:26.122]  He wrote an editorial about that?
[00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.181]  About how it was all a Ponzi scheme before all this came down?
[00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:34.364]  The FBI had him under total surveillance, and boom.
[00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:42.389]  What he did with the hooker and even the sordid details came out to destroy him.
[00:17:42.389 --> 00:17:48.434]  And I'm not saying visiting hookers is a good thing, but it's a lot better than having 12-year-old kids at your house.
[00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:49.975]  12-year-old little boys.
[00:17:51.078 --> 00:17:58.101]  It's a, let me tell you, going to a consenting 25-year-old woman is a lot better than little kids.
[00:17:58.101 --> 00:18:04.303]  Now, I may be calling extremists for that or a bigot or something, but I think abusing little kids is wrong.
[00:18:04.303 --> 00:18:08.425]  I know people are trying to make it mainstream and they're trying to pass hate crimes laws.
[00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:09.805]  That's in the new hate crime bill.
[00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:12.386]  If you criticize that, you get in trouble.
[00:18:12.386 --> 00:18:13.927]  I mean, what's next?
[00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:18.989]  I mean, if I say it's wrong to have sex with a donkey, then I'm going to be arrested?
[00:18:21.718 --> 00:18:23.399]  You people are out of your minds.
[00:18:23.399 --> 00:18:27.900]  I just don't know what your problems are.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.741]  I mean, Barney Frank wants to have a 20-year-old man over at his house.
[00:18:30.741 --> 00:18:32.182]  That's his business.
[00:18:32.182 --> 00:18:34.383]  I'm not attacking him over that, but if he's got
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.483]  Young teenagers running an underage brothel out of his house.
[00:18:40.483 --> 00:18:44.927]  I don't want to hear about the governors with hookers or girlfriends.
[00:18:44.927 --> 00:18:46.368]  I don't want to hear about it.
[00:18:46.368 --> 00:18:53.574]  Not when Dianne Corrin Halliburton are caught running giant child kidnapping rings and it's in congressional testimony and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:18:53.574 --> 00:18:56.257]  I care about child kidnapping rings.
[00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:59.239]  I don't care about a governor with a mistress.
[00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:00.940]  I don't want to hear about it!
[00:19:01.684 --> 00:19:03.005]  Excuse me.
[00:19:03.005 --> 00:19:18.332]  The point is, is that they're going after these people who have got tiny skeletons in their closet compared to humongous mausoleums of skeletons.
[00:19:18.332 --> 00:19:19.853]  Look, I've just got to go over all this.
[00:19:19.853 --> 00:19:20.373]  It's insane.
[00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:32.086]  They are talking about the victims of the Joker poster contest, and the victims, and how painful it is, and how scary it is, and how they want to have state charges against whoever put them up on light poles.
[00:19:32.086 --> 00:19:35.290]  They're now saying that's an act of basically terrorism.
[00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:41.577]  My answer to that is, we better put more of them up, because they're openly trying to assault the First Amendment.
[00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:47.020]  Obama's in the Washington Post telling his supporters put them up on stop signs.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.620]  We say don't do that.
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.682]  But they're now saying putting these up anywhere is some kind of act of terrorism.
[00:19:53.682 --> 00:19:56.583]  You people are so un-American, you make me want to throw up.
[00:20:00.629 --> 00:20:06.610]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.350]  Think about that.
[00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.471]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:13.692]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:23.474]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[00:20:23.934 --> 00:20:29.761]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:30.942]  The choice is yours.
[00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:36.548]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:20:36.548 --> 00:20:41.634]  Choose for Health, the world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:20:41.634 --> 00:20:44.097]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.

[00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:03.431]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:06.353]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:21:06.353 --> 00:21:14.961]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:17.963]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:21:17.963 --> 00:21:23.167]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:24.769]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:26.210]  Take action now!
[00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.013]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:21:31.013 --> 00:21:34.995]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:38.337]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:21:38.337 --> 00:21:44.741]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:21:45.061 --> 00:21:51.026]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:21:51.026 --> 00:21:53.347]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:55.069]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:06.731]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:14.315]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.315 --> 00:22:20.479]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:22.860]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.381]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.381 --> 00:22:36.945]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.945 --> 00:22:38.626]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.626 --> 00:22:40.487]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.487 --> 00:22:46.689]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:55.653]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.653 --> 00:22:57.235]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.235 --> 00:22:58.416]  The people strike back!
[00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:07.833]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards and licenses?
[00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:11.775]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:20.100]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.002]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:23:23.002 --> 00:23:23.302]  You push
[00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:23.722]  I don't know.
[00:23:44.281 --> 00:23:48.203]  For around $5, you will be protected against RFID theft.
[00:23:48.203 --> 00:23:50.663]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[00:23:50.663 --> 00:23:53.164]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[00:23:53.164 --> 00:23:53.605]  Or call 1-800-610-2770.
[00:23:53.605 --> 00:23:53.845]  1-800-610-2770 today!
[00:24:01.345 --> 00:24:09.712]  Man, the mainstream media is really getting this wrong.
[00:24:09.712 --> 00:24:16.418]  They're now giving me credit for the Los Angeles posters and blaming me.
[00:24:16.418 --> 00:24:25.546]  My wife speaks Spanish and so I had her watch two different Spanish newscasts this morning where they're calling for my arrest as a racist.
[00:24:25.546 --> 00:24:27.248]  They're saying in these newscasts
[00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:36.919]  That it's racist, that it's because we have a president who for the first time has dark skin, that I don't like him, and that I need to be arrested.
[00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:46.505]  I mean, in America, Obama went... I remember when he went on television and said, great job hanging up my posters, and he used it as official campaign.
[00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:48.306]  He said, put them up on stop signs.
[00:24:48.306 --> 00:24:50.547]  We have the Washington Post with him quoted saying that.
[00:24:50.547 --> 00:24:54.630]  He wrote a letter to the constituent, the famous poster artist, thanking him.
[00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.211]  For putting them on stop signs.
[00:24:57.211 --> 00:25:00.574]  So the President can tell his people to put it on stop signs.
[00:25:00.574 --> 00:25:05.858]  I say in the contest, follow your local rules, but post it where all the posters are at.
[00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:12.643]  And we're even seeing them being pulled down in areas by bars and, you know, areas where people do hang posters.
[00:25:12.643 --> 00:25:20.449]  They'll leave up the rock and roll poster, or the poster about the church, or the poster about a lost dog, or about a garage sale.
[00:25:25.262 --> 00:25:34.282]  But, if you criticize Obama, it is all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:38.582]  And they say they have a whole team of police in Claremont, Florida.
[00:25:38.582 --> 00:25:41.204]  That's, I guess, the county that Orlando's in.
[00:25:41.204 --> 00:25:46.088]  And they've got all these people on the news hyperventilating, saying how scary it is.
[00:25:46.088 --> 00:25:51.552]  And I haven't played in these clips here on air because there's been so many other big news stories going on.
[00:25:51.552 --> 00:26:01.099]  Open announcements of preparations for martial law, open announcements of forced inoculations, mainline scientists in major publications saying that the
[00:26:02.284 --> 00:26:14.895]  Current flu vaccine, they bought 195 million doses of, they're buying another 100 million, so one for everybody in the country, is grown on dead baby retinas, and has cancer viruses in it for some reason.
[00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:20.220]  That's mainstream news, and we've got just all these incredible things happening, meanwhile,
[00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:29.033]  Two weeks ago, I saw them saying it was illegal, it was bad, it was racist, that somebody put up Obama socialism posters.
[00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:33.257]  So I said, you know, that's a good way to defile this puppet leader.
[00:26:33.257 --> 00:26:40.206]  To get rid of this angel-like image he's got and let people know that he's not above ridicule, like we did with Bush.
[00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:44.412]  We've got to pull down their symbols they're using to push their agenda through.
[00:26:44.412 --> 00:26:47.632]  So I said, we're going to put it up, and we're going to post these flyers if you want them.
[00:26:47.632 --> 00:26:48.913]  Mark Dice did it before us.
[00:26:48.913 --> 00:26:51.733]  He actually gave me the idea to have a contest.
[00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:53.334]  I said, good idea, Mark Dice.
[00:26:53.334 --> 00:27:01.135]  We linked to his contest, and we also put up ours, and we said, but he's more of a fascist, so we'll have socialist and fascist posters you can print off.
[00:27:01.135 --> 00:27:07.877]  Then people started hanging them up, and I noticed, I guess this is right before I announced the contest, when I just posted the posters,
[00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:13.839]  And I went on air and I said, now be careful, folks, because they're going to politically say you're a terrorist.
[00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:15.659]  Be sure you hang these in legal areas.
[00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:17.300]  And we said that day one with the contest.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.320]  So we're covered liability-wise.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.941]  But still people are bold.
[00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:22.321]  They're sick of the tyranny.
[00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:25.422]  All the new, not all, but many of the new videos were being sent.
[00:27:25.422 --> 00:27:29.703]  People are aggressively putting them up on post offices on purpose.
[00:27:29.703 --> 00:27:33.944]  They're aggressively sticking them on government buildings because they're sick of the government.
[00:27:35.435 --> 00:27:37.917]  I mean, these are people filming themselves doing it.
[00:27:37.917 --> 00:27:38.898]  These are new videos.
[00:27:38.898 --> 00:27:40.419]  You can look at when they upload them.
[00:27:40.419 --> 00:27:43.722]  You can look at, you know, when they're producing them.
[00:27:43.722 --> 00:27:51.209]  And so, again, folks, you need... Also, I think people are seeing the other contests that are going on with Mark Dice.
[00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:54.692]  My contest, the original group putting up the Socialism posters.
[00:27:57.748 --> 00:28:00.169]  And so people aren't even going to our contest page.
[00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:01.709]  They're not even going to our contest videos.
[00:28:01.709 --> 00:28:02.809]  They're doing this on their own.
[00:28:02.809 --> 00:28:06.110]  Because I'm seeing them with Michelle Obama.
[00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.071]  I'm seeing them with George Bush everywhere.
[00:28:09.071 --> 00:28:10.371]  And not posters we made.
[00:28:10.371 --> 00:28:11.911]  We have a George Bush version.
[00:28:11.911 --> 00:28:15.192]  I'm not... I'm seeing... This is just spontaneous.
[00:28:15.192 --> 00:28:19.873]  Kind of like I picked up off of what some unnamed person was doing.
[00:28:19.873 --> 00:28:21.534]  And Mark Dice picked up off of them.
[00:28:21.534 --> 00:28:22.794]  I picked up off of Mark Dice.
[00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:29.898]  And this thing is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:28:29.898 --> 00:28:31.879]  But we're also seeing selective enforcement.
[00:28:31.879 --> 00:28:37.561]  When Michael Reagan said, I am hiring people for the murder of Mark Dice and other 9-11 truthers.
[00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:38.942]  I will pay you to murder them.
[00:28:38.942 --> 00:28:40.663]  I will pay you money.
[00:28:40.663 --> 00:28:43.544]  He didn't get in trouble.
[00:28:43.544 --> 00:28:46.065]  300 radio stations, 10 million listeners at least.
[00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:49.321]  Huge website.
[00:28:49.321 --> 00:28:53.325]  He said, murder us, kill us, hunt us down, shoot us.
[00:28:53.325 --> 00:28:55.807]  I'm serious, he said, murder them.
[00:28:55.807 --> 00:29:05.877]  But then, somebody on Infowars.com said, go after the cop that killed the poor black guy by shooting him in the back on the DART platform.
[00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:09.720]  You know, the DART train platform.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.182]  It's called DART there in San Francisco.
[00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:17.141]  And they went, arrested him, indicted him, and last time I heard he's plea bargaining.
[00:29:17.141 --> 00:29:24.403]  And you can just Google, Alex Jones F the Pigs, and that's the keyword search, and that's the headlines in the AP and Wired Magazine.
[00:29:24.403 --> 00:29:26.684]  That was his handle.
[00:29:26.684 --> 00:29:30.465]  So, Michael Reagan can say, kill us, that's good.
[00:29:30.465 --> 00:29:33.026]  Solicit murder nationwide, that's good.
[00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:33.906]  According to them.
[00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:38.708]  But then say, go after a cop, then you're going to go to jail.
[00:29:40.273 --> 00:29:41.374]  Now it's the same thing here.
[00:29:41.374 --> 00:29:47.136]  Obama can say, put pictures of me up everywhere worshipping me, put them up on government property, it's hail.
[00:29:47.136 --> 00:29:50.958]  But you put it up on light poles and it's not worshipping, you're in trouble.
[00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:54.880]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.581]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.845 --> 00:30:03.867]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.867 --> 00:30:09.192]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.192 --> 00:30:11.254]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.254 --> 00:30:16.258]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.258 --> 00:30:17.439]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.439 --> 00:30:18.560]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.441]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:21.242]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.502 --> 00:30:23.704]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.704 --> 00:30:25.045]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.045 --> 00:30:26.566]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:31.830]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.432]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.432 --> 00:30:38.895]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.235 --> 00:30:40.456]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.456 --> 00:30:41.377]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.377 --> 00:30:42.478]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.478 --> 00:30:43.399]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.399 --> 00:30:44.500]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.542]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.542 --> 00:30:49.324]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.324 --> 00:30:50.244]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.457 --> 00:31:07.483]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.483 --> 00:31:13.369]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.369 --> 00:31:19.535]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:21.817]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.817 --> 00:31:24.298]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.298 --> 00:31:37.488]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.488 --> 00:31:39.169]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:41.030]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:47.235]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:56.175]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.175 --> 00:31:57.756]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.756 --> 00:32:01.399]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.399 --> 00:32:04.420]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:09.764]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.764 --> 00:32:11.805]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:16.408]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.408 --> 00:32:17.029]  We're good to go.
[00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.011]  How much will you need?
[00:32:41.011 --> 00:32:41.912]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.912 --> 00:32:43.033]  How much do you want?
[00:32:43.033 --> 00:32:43.954]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.954 --> 00:32:45.055]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:45.055 --> 00:32:48.098]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:48.098 --> 00:32:49.880]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.801]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:22.932 --> 00:33:29.416]  You know, some people say to me, why even have a contest about going out and putting out Obama posters?
[00:33:29.416 --> 00:33:32.717]  Because it's about taking action.
[00:33:32.717 --> 00:33:38.300]  It's easy to sit there and critique it and say it should have been this image, it should have been that image.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:48.866]  Get up off your butt, post it on the web, come up with a PDF file, if it's a good idea, or it comes across our desk, we'll link to it.
[00:33:48.866 --> 00:33:51.528]  Go out and put it on message boards, go out and put it places.
[00:33:52.412 --> 00:33:56.575]  It's about the people learning that they can go out with messages.
[00:33:56.575 --> 00:34:16.150]  You know, if they start setting up martial law, and they shut this radio show off, or they trump up charges and come arrest me for some other issue, or they start restricting talk radio, as they're doing, for whatever reason, you need to then, in your own house, print up messages and go out at night, if you have to, and risk your life.
[00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.172]  Because by then, they'll probably grab you and take you to a re-education center.
[00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:20.173]  And I'm not joking.
[00:34:20.173 --> 00:34:21.174]  That's what they're gearing up for.
[00:34:22.051 --> 00:34:45.908]  So we better get out with our voices and be heard now before we have Congressman Brown and Paul and Sherman and Senator Inhofe and the list goes on and on on record saying they've been threatened with martial law and it's continuing into this administration because the president's work for the shadow government.
[00:34:45.908 --> 00:34:46.529]  Northcom.
[00:34:48.325 --> 00:34:53.387]  The National Security Council runs the country, and it's run by foreign banks.
[00:34:53.387 --> 00:34:55.629]  Period!
[00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:57.810]  The military runs the NSA.
[00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.170]  They run FEMA now.
[00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.892]  Have you watched online FEMA press conferences?
[00:35:01.892 --> 00:35:04.833]  It's generals, it's admirals, with troops standing behind them.
[00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:06.274]  They've already taken over.
[00:35:06.274 --> 00:35:08.495]  It's already happened.
[00:35:08.495 --> 00:35:11.156]  They're just doing it in plain view like it's normal.
[00:35:11.156 --> 00:35:12.857]  Yet there is nothing more American
[00:35:14.934 --> 00:35:25.396]  I told people a month ago, my idea was to have people print up flyers that say, don't take the flu vaccine.
[00:35:25.396 --> 00:35:30.257]  And then have a website address that has the facts under it.
[00:35:30.257 --> 00:35:40.240]  And we've had Sherry Tenpenny, the doctor on, who's got flyers on her site and fact sheets, and I've had other doctors on, and we're just here trying to warn people.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.340]  I mean, go out and do that!
[00:35:42.318 --> 00:35:52.224]  The issue is, we knew the stupid media, the controlled corporate horror media, who operated about a third grade level, and I mean that when I say it, would pick up on the Joker.
[00:35:52.224 --> 00:36:05.152]  And we knew they'd say it was bad and evil and racist, and then that would point out their hypocrisy, because everybody's fished out the photos of posters plastered as Bush as a vampire and Bush as a Joker.
[00:36:05.152 --> 00:36:08.234]  And Bush as a monkey, that was one of the most popular.
[00:36:08.234 --> 00:36:10.556]  Those things were all over my town where I live, in Austin.
[00:36:12.659 --> 00:36:14.420]  And nobody said it was racist then.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:14.900]  No.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.320]  He's the president.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.441]  He's the most public figure you can be in the world.
[00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:26.143]  He is trying to cram through an unpopular agenda.
[00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:33.225]  And so now in Claremont, and in Orlando, and now national news as well, man admits to putting up 500 Obama posters.
[00:36:36.997 --> 00:36:38.578]  As Joker posters.
[00:36:38.578 --> 00:36:46.102]  Police in Claremont have one suspect that has admitted to putting up dozens of posters around the city, putting President Obama as the Joker character from a Batman movie.
[00:36:46.102 --> 00:36:48.203]  And you can go watch these newscasts.
[00:36:48.203 --> 00:36:53.486]  We played a short clip from one, there's like five of them, or more, more than five, oh wait, no.
[00:36:53.486 --> 00:36:54.686]  There's eight of them I've seen.
[00:36:54.686 --> 00:36:59.069]  If you count the two Spanish, there's six English I've seen, two Spanish.
[00:36:59.069 --> 00:37:05.212]  And the Spanish ones say I need to be arrested, and they go in to people who can't even speak English, and they call for my arrest,
[00:37:06.854 --> 00:37:18.499]  And they call for this guy's arrest, and then they got all these old people on the other newscasts going, arrest whoever did it, you're not supposed to do this, it's un-American, you're not supposed to disrespect our president.
[00:37:18.499 --> 00:37:19.359]  Of course you are!
[00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:21.920]  That's what this country's all about!
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:30.264]  They burned effigies, and put up effigies of George Washington hanging in all 13 colonies.
[00:37:30.264 --> 00:37:33.505]  Anybody who's seen the Made for TV miniseries
[00:37:35.439 --> 00:37:38.201]  Adams, John Adams, very accurate.
[00:37:38.201 --> 00:37:45.067]  I've probably read more than a hundred history books on the Revolutionary War and the years after it.
[00:37:45.067 --> 00:37:46.568]  I'm very into it.
[00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:48.409]  It was worse than that.
[00:37:48.409 --> 00:38:00.719]  They were running up at night to the presidential house, it wasn't the White House at the time, throwing buckets of night soil.
[00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:03.741]  People, you know, their toilets, they went to the bathroom and
[00:38:05.276 --> 00:38:08.918]  Brass containers, and they were dumping that on the White House at night.
[00:38:08.918 --> 00:38:11.179]  Can you imagine?
[00:38:11.179 --> 00:38:23.424]  And people wanted to have him shot, and people wanted to have him arrested, and George Washington said no.
[00:38:23.424 --> 00:38:34.069]  And I gotta be honest, I don't think you should be dumping buckets of human waste on the White House, but, you know, the issue here is that's what we've gone from that, burning effigies of him all over the country.
[00:38:35.728 --> 00:38:40.630]  And they came to him and said, let's arrest these people, and he said, no.
[00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.492]  We're not going to turn into what we just fought.
[00:38:44.492 --> 00:38:52.615]  If they lay a hand on anybody, then we'll individually, through due process of law, through the juries and grand juries, prosecute them.
[00:38:52.615 --> 00:38:55.456]  Now, if you want to follow George Washington, that's what you do.
[00:38:55.456 --> 00:38:59.018]  But now we've gotten to the point of, oh my gosh, arrest whoever did it!
[00:38:59.018 --> 00:39:00.478]  It's horrible!
[00:39:00.478 --> 00:39:01.739]  It's illegal!
[00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.860]  And I've got the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:39:04.844 --> 00:39:10.968]  For four months, leaving up comments on their site, saying I and others need to be killed?
[00:39:10.968 --> 00:39:18.093]  That we need to be murdered for our political views?
[00:39:18.093 --> 00:39:21.956]  Stuart Rhodes is coming up on that issue, but this is fundamental to everything.
[00:39:21.956 --> 00:39:25.238]  I mean, I couldn't... I mean, I knew the media was gonna freak out over it.
[00:39:25.238 --> 00:39:27.300]  I didn't think, because the L.A.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.403]  police didn't say, we're gonna arrest whoever's putting up these socialism posters.
[00:39:32.512 --> 00:39:36.415]  And they spread all over San Francisco and other areas of California.
[00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:46.001]  But now there's San Francisco articles, San Francisco articles you can pull up, where they've got my posters saying, oh he's bad, he's evil, thank God they've been scraped off.
[00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:56.449]  You know, we never took credit for the Obama posters in California, though I'd love to.
[00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:02.193]  We said it's a good idea and the media is trying to chill it.
[00:40:03.152 --> 00:40:07.575]  And so, we salute whoever's doing it, and we think more people should do it.
[00:40:07.575 --> 00:40:10.117]  Make sure you follow your local laws.
[00:40:10.117 --> 00:40:13.220]  And I will tell the people that are running around sticking them on mailboxes.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:18.243]  I mean, there's videos of people sneaking up behind police stations, sticking them on the police stations.
[00:40:18.243 --> 00:40:29.492]  They're sneaking up, sticking them on post office boxes, and it's totally American what you're doing, and they're ninnying and sucking their thumbs on TV going, oh my gosh, they're attacking federal facilities!
[00:40:30.112 --> 00:40:32.133]  Oh, there's the victims!
[00:40:32.133 --> 00:40:36.195]  Policer, we're interviewing victims!
[00:40:36.195 --> 00:40:38.936]  Give it a break, you un-American people!
[00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.617]  I mean, Florida really is a scary police state.
[00:40:41.617 --> 00:40:48.941]  It turned out the last three directors of CPS in the state were child rapers, not just pedophiles, but worse than Barney Frank.
[00:40:50.151 --> 00:40:52.052]  Nothing happens to them.
[00:40:52.052 --> 00:40:55.734]  3,000 plus kids missing, CNN reports, they find them buried.
[00:40:55.734 --> 00:40:58.276]  I mean, the state officials, when they're done with them, murder them.
[00:40:58.276 --> 00:40:59.937]  You don't care about dead kids, do you?
[00:40:59.937 --> 00:41:00.657]  No, no, no.
[00:41:00.657 --> 00:41:01.898]  That's fun!
[00:41:01.898 --> 00:41:07.902]  That's all in a day's work, little kids you rape and then kill and bury in shallow graves.
[00:41:07.902 --> 00:41:10.423]  Paul Watson's got links to it in our article about this.
[00:41:10.423 --> 00:41:16.307]  No, you're not worried about the dead kids in shallow graves or Barney Frank's rape rooms up in Georgetown.
[00:41:20.185 --> 00:41:24.871]  What you are worried about is posters.
[00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:29.396]  And that's because you're thugs.
[00:41:29.396 --> 00:41:35.284]  Now maybe the media is distorting what the police are doing and distorting their quotes and maybe the cops know this is ridiculous, running around.
[00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:37.567]  It says they got a whole bunch of detectives on it full-time.
[00:41:39.608 --> 00:41:45.053]  And maybe you're not idiots in Florida, in that county, but I sincerely doubt it.
[00:41:45.053 --> 00:41:47.294]  I mean, you are by Disney World, aren't you?
[00:41:47.294 --> 00:41:49.276]  You are living in a make-believe land.
[00:41:49.276 --> 00:41:54.561]  Let me give you the newsflash, cops, they've already taken your pensions.
[00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:59.164]  You might as well join the American people.
[00:41:59.164 --> 00:42:05.590]  So I really can't speak for the police because it's the media saying the police are saying this, and I don't know, but
[00:42:06.823 --> 00:42:19.494]  Police in Claremont, one suspect that has admitted to putting up dozens of posters around the city, depicting President Obama as the Joker, character from the Batman movie, but more people are believed to have been involved.
[00:42:19.494 --> 00:42:26.080]  Police say the man in custody admitted to putting up 500 of the posters.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:34.307]  The posters are tied to a national contest put on by the syndicated radio host who urges his fans to post the images of the president in exchange for a prize.
[00:42:35.782 --> 00:42:42.188]  No, it says the person that does it the most artfully and the best will get the prize.
[00:42:42.188 --> 00:42:50.397]  City officials still continue are unsure just how much damage was caused by the signs and the dollar amount associated with the cleanup.
[00:42:51.772 --> 00:42:57.093]  And it shows them on telephone poles, stapled up, and they come over and go, it's horrible!
[00:42:57.093 --> 00:42:58.373]  It's terrible!
[00:42:58.373 --> 00:43:00.234]  You've got to watch the videos to believe it.
[00:43:00.234 --> 00:43:04.355]  And they look all upset, and they're like shaking, and they cut back to the anchor shaking their head.
[00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:06.315]  Oh, this is just terrible.
[00:43:06.315 --> 00:43:13.756]  But the state officials kidnapping and murdering children, it's not, we're not going to report on that for you.
[00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:15.257]  Florida is the pedophile capital.
[00:43:15.257 --> 00:43:16.317]  It's the happy hunting ground.
[00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:20.236]  Do you think they got the worst CPS everything?
[00:43:20.236 --> 00:43:24.207]  Do you think it's appropriate to use the Joker caricature to protest the health care issue?
[00:43:26.397 --> 00:43:28.798]  The voting is now over, but visit our viewer poll.
[00:43:28.798 --> 00:43:31.659]  Can we pull up this poll, guys, off this article?
[00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:35.980]  Maybe later, after Stuart Rhodes leaves us, we'll play some of these ridiculous news clips.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.882]  I mean, like I said, I've seen eight of them at least, and I don't have time.
[00:43:40.882 --> 00:43:51.705]  I'm trying to make a film right now and deal with a bunch of other stuff to even follow all this, but there's articles in Dallas, and articles in New York, and articles in San Francisco, and articles in Los Angeles, and articles in Detroit.
[00:43:52.285 --> 00:43:54.066]  And articles in Tennessee.
[00:43:54.066 --> 00:43:55.507]  I mean, here's one from Tennessee.
[00:43:55.507 --> 00:44:00.089]  Safety concerns cited in removal of Obama Joker posters in Tennessee.
[00:44:00.089 --> 00:44:07.152]  And the police are saying, this is an act of vandalism and very dangerous to put them up on light poles.
[00:44:07.152 --> 00:44:08.652]  And you can go read it.
[00:44:08.652 --> 00:44:12.654]  It's out of the Greenville Sun.
[00:44:12.654 --> 00:44:14.035]  Such selective enforcement.
[00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:21.523]  I mean, I went out and stapled these up in front of police last week and they did nothing.
[00:44:21.523 --> 00:44:25.265]  Because the Austin police, I guess, are not Nazi thugs.
[00:44:25.265 --> 00:44:28.066]  I guess they're actually Americans.
[00:44:28.066 --> 00:44:43.215]  Or the police chief, and not perfect, but, you know, he... He doesn't have them out arresting people because the places I posted these were on light poles that were already just covered with signs.
[00:44:45.822 --> 00:44:47.443]  I drive by these signs all the time.
[00:44:47.443 --> 00:44:56.306]  I did this near our office, over here in the hood.
[00:44:56.306 --> 00:45:01.929]  I'm right there with police cars driving by, stapling them up.
[00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:04.990]  Pretty soon they're going to try to say breathing is illegal or something.
[00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:10.152]  Are they going to arrest the people that put up the yard signs or the church signs?
[00:45:10.152 --> 00:45:12.373]  I saw one of these driving to work a few weeks ago.
[00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:15.065]  A fire department benefit?
[00:45:15.065 --> 00:45:17.826]  Oh, let's go arrest the fire department now.
[00:45:17.826 --> 00:45:23.107]  I mean, are you going to go arrest?
[00:45:23.107 --> 00:45:24.767]  This is the big question.
[00:45:24.767 --> 00:45:33.969]  Are you going to go, are you going to arrest then-Senator, now-President Obama?
[00:45:33.969 --> 00:45:37.650]  Last year, we got the Washington Post linked up.
[00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.350]  See, I've got all this news to cover and
[00:45:41.294 --> 00:45:46.296]  So this isn't, we're not just spending this much time on this because it's about me or InfoWars.com or the contest.
[00:45:46.296 --> 00:45:51.178]  It's about the First Amendment and about how crazy this government's got.
[00:45:51.178 --> 00:45:56.780]  Do you think it's appropriate to use the Joker caricature to protest the healthcare issue?
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.762]  59% said yes, 37% said no.
[00:46:00.762 --> 00:46:06.264]  And this is in a slanted Orlando, Florida News 13 TV piece that says arrest me.
[00:46:07.605 --> 00:46:16.227]  With every person whining and crying in the interview about how un-American and evil it is.
[00:46:16.227 --> 00:46:20.468]  Results, if you found $2,000 in cash, would you return it?
[00:46:20.468 --> 00:46:21.669]  Yes.
[00:46:21.669 --> 00:46:22.809]  Well, why do they have these questions?
[00:46:22.809 --> 00:46:25.090]  I guess there's a bunch of other polls in here.
[00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:25.270]  So, 59%
[00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.551]  Notice that news result is the same about returning the cash.
[00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:38.793]  I guarantee ya, the 59% that would return the cash are the 59% that think it's appropriate to use the Joker.
[00:46:38.793 --> 00:46:46.915]  And I bet you my bottom dollar that the 37% that say the Joker poster's wrong are the 37% that would steal your wallet.
[00:46:46.915 --> 00:46:48.636]  I guarantee it!
[00:46:48.636 --> 00:46:50.817]  Notice those numbers are the same there.
[00:46:50.817 --> 00:46:54.418]  We gotta get a screenshot of this and get Paul to do an article on it or a blurb.
[00:46:56.508 --> 00:46:59.509]  Results for if you found $2,000 cash, would you return it?
[00:46:59.509 --> 00:47:02.230]  59% would return it.
[00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.631]  40% said they'd keep it.
[00:47:05.631 --> 00:47:07.132]  What kind of screwed up poll is that?
[00:47:07.132 --> 00:47:13.294]  40% would keep it?
[00:47:13.294 --> 00:47:15.255]  I found wallets a couple times with money in them.
[00:47:15.255 --> 00:47:16.495]  I mean, what?
[00:47:16.495 --> 00:47:22.698]  What kind of crazy, don't you understand that when you steal somebody's wallet, it comes back on you?
[00:47:22.698 --> 00:47:23.298]  I tell you what.
[00:47:24.747 --> 00:47:30.649]  Results for, do you think it's appropriate to use the Joker character to protest the health care system?
[00:47:30.649 --> 00:47:32.550]  59% said yes, 37% said no.
[00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:38.232]  And you read the comments, about 95% are against News 13 and the other channels.
[00:47:38.232 --> 00:47:43.074]  I mean literally, you'll read three, four pages of people that are going, what's your problem?
[00:47:43.074 --> 00:47:44.535]  This is hypocritical!
[00:47:44.535 --> 00:47:47.336]  I saw anti-Bush stickers and signs all over!
[00:47:48.678 --> 00:47:52.701]  Mailboxes and all over light poles and there was never all this ninnying and freaking out.
[00:47:52.701 --> 00:47:54.283]  We've got links to these people.
[00:47:54.283 --> 00:48:05.172]  And then you'll see one guy who says he works for the TV station arguing and posting every five or six posts calling everyone racist.
[00:48:05.172 --> 00:48:09.616]  I mean, you people are nuts!
[00:48:09.616 --> 00:48:16.822]  You think it's un-American to put up a thing saying fascist or socialist or New World Order under Obama on a light pole.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.182]  Even if you disagree with it, there's nothing more American.
[00:48:22.182 --> 00:48:26.624]  And I can't believe I can't get this through your head.
[00:48:26.624 --> 00:48:32.446]  But sure enough, I tell you, the Spanish Channel ones are the worst, calling for my arrest.
[00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:37.968]  I'm gonna call my wife in to interpret.
[00:48:40.683 --> 00:48:46.786]  And it's just something really sticks in my craw about... She said his accent in One Guy was not even from Mexico.
[00:48:46.786 --> 00:48:48.647]  She knows the different accents.
[00:48:48.647 --> 00:48:50.948]  She said it sounded like Central American.
[00:48:50.948 --> 00:48:52.428]  She could barely understand it.
[00:48:52.428 --> 00:48:57.190]  She speaks like Castilian because she lived in Madrid for four years.
[00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.552]  She could understand the Tex-Mex, but she says it's got some of its own words.
[00:49:00.552 --> 00:49:01.652]  It's kind of like American English.
[00:49:01.652 --> 00:49:05.014]  It's different from English English.
[00:49:05.014 --> 00:49:05.214]  But...
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.864]  She had to listen to it a couple times, but it appears he's not even Mexican.
[00:49:12.864 --> 00:49:21.690]  I mean, it's some guy from thousands of miles away saying, arrest me and I'm a racist, here in my country, telling me I don't have a First Amendment.
[00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:22.431]  It's disgusting!
[00:49:26.215 --> 00:49:30.539]  I mean, you criticize the government in Mexico, they'll come beat you up or arrest you or kill you.
[00:49:30.539 --> 00:49:33.641]  Same thing in Guatemala and other places.
[00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:38.685]  How about if you think it's inappropriate, how about you go back to Guatemala or wherever it is you're from?
[00:49:38.685 --> 00:49:39.546]  How's that sound, pal?
[00:49:39.546 --> 00:49:43.790]  Because I'll welcome you here in open arms if you just stand up for America.
[00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:51.256]  But see, that's why I don't like the fact that the country's got 30 million illegals, most of them making up the military now, is because I understand what's going on.
[00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:54.511]  And I understand you're killing our culture.
[00:49:54.511 --> 00:49:56.952]  Our culture isn't black or white or hispanic.
[00:49:56.952 --> 00:49:59.034]  Our culture is the Bill of Rights.
[00:49:59.034 --> 00:50:03.577]  You can shove it... Excuse me.
[00:50:03.577 --> 00:50:06.579]  You can take the Bill of Rights and you can put it in a pipe and smoke it.
[00:50:06.579 --> 00:50:12.383]  You understand me?
[00:50:12.383 --> 00:50:18.307]  You know, I defend the Marie Conquista's right to go around with her sign saying, bring down America, take down America.
[00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:28.569]  And I got a mini-film called Battle for the Republic that's an extra 15 minute, 16 minute extra in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:50:28.569 --> 00:50:35.074]  And it shows police at a guy where there's tens of thousands of illegals protesting for open borders in Seattle.
[00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:39.558]  The cops come over to a guy peacefully protesting against it, tell him to stop protesting.
[00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:40.519]  He says no.
[00:50:40.519 --> 00:50:46.745]  They slam his head in the ground, bust his whole forehead open, and then laugh and let the illegals celebrate over his body.
[00:50:49.019 --> 00:50:56.223]  Let me tell you, you got the government teamed up with the illegal aliens to bring this country down, and I've had enough of your police state garbage.
[00:50:56.223 --> 00:50:56.723]  You got me?
[00:50:56.723 --> 00:50:59.065]  And your illegal alien troops, too.
[00:50:59.065 --> 00:51:00.806]  You make me sick.
[00:51:00.806 --> 00:51:07.509]  eCigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:51:07.509 --> 00:51:09.190]  It's called the eCigarette.
[00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:13.773]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:51:13.773 --> 00:51:15.514]  But because this is not a cigarette,
[00:51:15.674 --> 00:51:21.419]  You don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:51:21.419 --> 00:51:26.303]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire, and has no dangerous secondhand smoke.
[00:51:26.303 --> 00:51:32.548]  So it's safe for the people around you, and will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[00:51:32.548 --> 00:51:36.271]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.
[00:51:36.271 --> 00:51:39.014]  Learn more by visiting eCigarettesNational.com.
[00:51:39.674 --> 00:51:40.254]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:40.254 --> 00:51:41.535]  A new world order.
[00:51:41.535 --> 00:51:42.715]  In the near future.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.142]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:10.142 --> 00:52:12.963]  It's known as the Builder Bird Group.
[00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.745]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:15.745 --> 00:52:18.947]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:18.947 --> 00:52:26.271]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.281 --> 00:52:34.725]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:34.725 --> 00:52:38.587]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.587 --> 00:52:41.169]  Build a paradise and make great progress toward a world with government.
[00:52:41.169 --> 00:52:42.330]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:43.110]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:44.391]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:45.372]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.372 --> 00:52:46.533]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:52:46.533 --> 00:52:55.238]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:58.040]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.121]  You have been warned.
[00:53:00.402 --> 00:53:02.463]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:53:02.463 --> 00:53:05.405]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:53:05.405 --> 00:53:07.647]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:53:07.647 --> 00:53:08.628]  Here's the story.
[00:53:08.628 --> 00:53:13.431]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:14.672]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:53:14.672 --> 00:53:19.756]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:53:19.756 --> 00:53:21.617]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:53:21.877 --> 00:53:26.479]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:53:26.479 --> 00:53:31.981]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:34.182]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:53:34.182 --> 00:53:43.205]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:53:43.205 --> 00:53:48.367]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:53:48.367 --> 00:53:50.528]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[00:53:50.768 --> 00:53:52.470]  MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:55.273]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:54:17.065 --> 00:54:20.587]  We're gonna go live to PrisonPlanet.tv at 8 after in the next hour.
[00:54:20.587 --> 00:54:23.089]  We start the second segment of the second hour.
[00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:32.595]  It'll be almost about 20-30 minutes, then I'm gonna open the phones up and get into all this other news, but, uh... This is really getting crazy.
[00:54:33.888 --> 00:54:42.594]  The whining, the crying, the complaining, the thumb-sucking, the... It's just such a government of wimps.
[00:54:42.594 --> 00:54:44.276]  They're so gelded.
[00:54:44.276 --> 00:54:50.100]  The public that they have on TV going, oh, arrest everyone, it's evil, it's wrong.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.402]  But you know how the buddy works at the Austin Airport?
[00:54:53.402 --> 00:54:59.507]  I'm not gonna say what he works in, but it's pretty clear it's... I'm not gonna say what division of public relations.
[00:54:59.507 --> 00:55:01.068]  But he's there when the media's there.
[00:55:03.137 --> 00:55:20.828]  And he told me years ago when I was hanging out with his brother who also works at another local TV station that he'll sit there and watch them and they'll interview like 30 40 50 people about the checkpoints and take your shoes off or you can't have a water bottle
[00:55:21.877 --> 00:55:28.722]  And every person will say, it's horrible, it's stupid, it's a police state, they're using us to train us to be slaves, I don't like it.
[00:55:28.722 --> 00:55:38.569]  And then one old lady, he said, 30 plus in, as he has to stand there behind the TV crew, in this case it was News 8, said, I think it's just great to keep us safe, I just love it.
[00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:43.012]  And he knew they were going to turn the camera off then, and he knew that would be on the news.
[00:55:43.012 --> 00:55:48.957]  And so we were all standing around at the TV station, he's going, wait, I'm waiting for this to come on, watch, watch, because he's over there visiting his brother.
[00:55:49.537 --> 00:55:50.577]  He goes, here it goes!
[00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:50.998]  Here it goes!
[00:55:50.998 --> 00:55:51.618]  Yes, it's her!
[00:55:51.618 --> 00:55:52.038]  It's her!
[00:55:52.038 --> 00:55:54.419]  And he was new when the newscast was coming on.
[00:55:54.419 --> 00:55:55.379]  They told him.
[00:55:55.379 --> 00:55:56.680]  It was also his job to watch.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.461]  So he was, you know, there making sure he had a TV on.
[00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:04.382]  And we're in the equipment room of the TV station.
[00:56:04.382 --> 00:56:06.903]  Austin Access.
[00:56:06.903 --> 00:56:08.004]  His brother works in equipment.
[00:56:08.004 --> 00:56:08.704]  And we're sitting there.
[00:56:10.006 --> 00:56:13.628]  Saying, watch this, watch this, you're going to see this little old lady wearing a blue dress.
[00:56:13.628 --> 00:56:14.669]  And he's like, ah-ha!
[00:56:14.669 --> 00:56:16.130]  We're all laughing, there she is!
[00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.252]  I mean, that's how staged the media is.
[00:56:19.252 --> 00:56:21.253]  They went out all over that Florida town.
[00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:31.140]  I bet for every one person they found against the Obama posters, they had ten against it.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:37.524]  Because it was old folks and they like to be, on average, conform and don't be disrespectful to the President.
[00:56:38.683 --> 00:56:41.024]  So I'd imagine it wasn't 30 or 40 they had to talk to.
[00:56:41.024 --> 00:56:42.404]  It was probably 10 or 15.
[00:56:42.404 --> 00:56:45.745]  They found a few people.
[00:56:45.745 --> 00:56:47.045]  That is how they rig it.
[00:56:47.045 --> 00:56:53.027]  When you're watching the news, you're seeing a rigged situation.
[00:56:53.027 --> 00:56:57.828]  And, I mean, I challenge you to research it for yourself.
[00:56:57.828 --> 00:56:59.749]  And you should be insulted by that.
[00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:03.230]  You should be insulted by the fact that they're trying to manipulate you.
[00:57:05.031 --> 00:57:08.973]  So the headlines are, they're looking for more victims of the crime first.
[00:57:08.973 --> 00:57:10.514]  To go to the state grand jury.
[00:57:10.514 --> 00:57:12.335]  The state grand jury.
[00:57:12.335 --> 00:57:14.256]  They need serious charges.
[00:57:14.256 --> 00:57:17.918]  This is a massive conspiracy they've uncovered.
[00:57:17.918 --> 00:57:20.900]  Oh my gosh, of people out criticizing Obama.
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.941]  You can't do that.
[00:57:21.941 --> 00:57:22.721]  It's horrible.
[00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:23.822]  It needs to be illegal.
[00:57:23.822 --> 00:57:28.004]  And you can see these people commenting on InfoWars and Prison Planet and the stories.
[00:57:28.004 --> 00:57:29.065]  They're saying, come after us.
[00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:47.752]  We've got a very important article, that I hope everybody will get and email out to everyone, that says, Florida authorizes, having a Freudian moment there, authorizes, Florida authorities in hysterical crusade against First Amendment.
[00:57:47.752 --> 00:57:50.934]  Florida authorities in hysterical crusade against First Amendment.
[00:57:51.815 --> 00:57:54.255]  And it breaks it all down.
[00:57:54.255 --> 00:58:02.357]  The victims and the pain of the community and how the community's really not taking it well, but they're fighting back through it.
[00:58:02.357 --> 00:58:03.677]  Oh my gosh.
[00:58:03.677 --> 00:58:08.938]  If the wind blows, Claremont might just sink into the ocean, you know.
[00:58:08.938 --> 00:58:11.819]  Oh my gosh, the birds are tweeting outside.
[00:58:11.819 --> 00:58:12.979]  What is Claremont going to do?
[00:58:12.979 --> 00:58:13.639]  The birds!
[00:58:13.639 --> 00:58:14.199]  The noise!
[00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:15.599]  It's bothering them!
[00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:17.380]  They can't handle the birds tweeting!
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.180]  It's scary!
[00:58:21.525 --> 00:58:24.667]  Next, Claremont runs in fear.
[00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:25.968]  They heard a barking dog.
[00:58:25.968 --> 00:58:27.029]  They can't handle it.
[00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:28.710]  Will the owner be executed tonight at 7?
[00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:33.094]  You know, I mean, this is the... They're hanging signs up!
[00:58:33.094 --> 00:58:34.355]  It's so horrible!
[00:58:34.355 --> 00:58:36.296]  It's so scary!
[00:58:36.296 --> 00:58:37.737]  Mommy!
[00:58:37.737 --> 00:58:42.140]  Mommy!

[00:58:50.222 --> 00:58:55.529]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.529 --> 00:59:00.055]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.055 --> 00:59:02.338]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:03.960]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.002]  There is a solution.

[00:59:53.419 --> 00:59:55.820]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:05.203]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.203 --> 01:00:06.504]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.504 --> 01:00:08.284]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.284 --> 01:00:10.045]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.045 --> 01:00:11.625]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:13.186]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.186 --> 01:00:17.367]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:21.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.253 --> 01:00:35.560]  Okay, the Southern Poverty Law Center is demonizing militia groups and then gun owners and veterans and conservatives and libertarians by extension.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:42.806]  They say white supremacists connected to militias, connected to gun owners, are endangering the president.
[01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.347]  We need to ban their free speech.
[01:00:44.347 --> 01:00:45.348]  They're dangerous.
[01:00:45.348 --> 01:00:51.032]  We're going to be talking about that with Stuart Rhodes, Yale Law graduate, Special Forces officer.
[01:00:51.032 --> 01:00:51.693]  Great guy.
[01:00:52.901 --> 01:00:56.305]  He is coming up to discuss this, also the attack on free speech.
[01:00:56.305 --> 01:01:03.792]  It was okay to hang up Obama posters, and he even told the Washington Post and wrote letters to his constituents saying, please hang them up on stop signs.
[01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:08.818]  That's okay, but we say, hang them up on power poles and places where people post posters.
[01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.811]  You know, because other people aren't discriminated against.
[01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:12.611]  We shouldn't.
[01:01:12.611 --> 01:01:16.073]  And now the media is saying, arrest us, arrest whoever does it.
[01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:16.974]  It's evil.
[01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:19.115]  Oh, it victimizes the community.
[01:01:19.115 --> 01:01:20.095]  These people are sick.
[01:01:20.095 --> 01:01:24.217]  And they're on the news going, I just can't believe someone would do this to our president.
[01:01:24.217 --> 01:01:27.939]  It was okay to do that to Bush, which we actually encouraged here, of course.
[01:01:27.939 --> 01:01:30.400]  In your New World Order, we come after you.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:30.900]  It's real simple.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.061]  We're not Republican or Democrat.
[01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:35.714]  But it's really backfiring on MSNBC.
[01:01:35.714 --> 01:01:41.595]  They've had every one of their major hosts say, if you call Obama a socialist, that is code for the N-word.
[01:01:41.595 --> 01:01:45.276]  Talk about creating racism, divide and conquer, balkanization.
[01:01:45.276 --> 01:01:47.117]  Talk about trying to get a race riot going.
[01:01:47.117 --> 01:01:50.278]  There are a lot of dumb people out there, mainly white yuppies, that believe it now.
[01:01:50.278 --> 01:01:54.239]  I mean, talk about trying to destroy the First Amendment.
[01:01:54.239 --> 01:01:59.240]  Talk about wickedly knowing you were driving a wedge and creating racial division.
[01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:08.090]  Now, I got into some of this yesterday because what Oath Keepers deals with is fighting martial law.
[01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:13.938]  So we're going to talk some about free speech, the Southern Poverty Law Center, but then we're going to get into what Oath Keepers is doing because
[01:02:15.646 --> 01:02:20.569]  We now have the military saying they don't want 20,000 homeland security troops.
[01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:23.971]  They want 400,000 on the streets of America.
[01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:25.632]  This is huge news.
[01:02:25.632 --> 01:02:26.633]  It is so important.
[01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:31.676]  It ties into congressmen saying they want to use the flu situation as a pretext for martial law.
[01:02:31.676 --> 01:02:35.038]  It is all coming up today.
[01:02:35.038 --> 01:02:43.683]  Then we'll cover financial issues and open phones with Bob Chapman in the third hour, and then Alan Keyes is scheduled to be joining us in the fourth hour today.
[01:02:46.084 --> 01:02:46.904]  Alan Keyes.
[01:02:46.904 --> 01:02:48.865]  I'm always calling him Charles Key.
[01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:51.446]  Because of Charles Key in Oklahoma.
[01:02:51.446 --> 01:02:55.047]  Alan Keyes will be joining us today.
[01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:57.367]  So you don't want to miss that.
[01:02:57.367 --> 01:02:58.688]  But here are some of the headlines.
[01:02:58.688 --> 01:03:06.690]  The Pentagon wants the authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the United States.
[01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:09.771]  And we're going to get the writer of that article on next week if we can.
[01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:19.587]  The Pentagon has approached Congress to grant the Secretary of Defense the authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel throughout the United States.
[01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:23.030]  Folks, this is off the charts huge.
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:29.234]  I'm almost ashamed I just covered the Obama poster in the last 30 minutes, but that's all part of this.
[01:03:29.234 --> 01:03:32.176]  If we don't have the power, you don't have the power, folks.
[01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:37.881]  If they actually go with martial law and you make up handmade signs on your color copier or your copier and put them out,
[01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:45.783]  Under a tyranny, speaking out against it has hundreds of times the effect it does when you're living in liberty.
[01:03:45.783 --> 01:03:49.844]  You understand that we, all the tyranny is coming out in the open now.
[01:03:49.844 --> 01:03:54.066]  We've been vindicated on every issue!
[01:03:54.066 --> 01:03:58.947]  That's why I want to encourage other talk show hosts and other webmasters to not get involved in the COINTELPRO.
[01:03:58.947 --> 01:04:03.529]  I know most of you aren't involved in all the infighting and stuff because you're government agents.
[01:04:03.529 --> 01:04:04.229]  It's because you
[01:04:06.758 --> 01:04:09.820]  Are jealous and envious of me and others that are successful.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.402]  And you see it as a marketing strategy.
[01:04:12.402 --> 01:04:15.644]  Buddy, I am actually fearing for my life now.
[01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:19.747]  I am actually, for my whole family, and you should be for yours too.
[01:04:19.747 --> 01:04:20.428]  This is real.
[01:04:20.428 --> 01:04:21.749]  These are eugenicists.
[01:04:21.749 --> 01:04:24.731]  The folks running things created Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[01:04:24.731 --> 01:04:25.732]  This is real.
[01:04:25.732 --> 01:04:28.954]  Listen, you better understand, your life is in danger.
[01:04:28.954 --> 01:04:30.855]  All of us are in red-level crisis.
[01:04:30.855 --> 01:04:32.596]  The time for infighting's over.
[01:04:32.596 --> 01:04:34.438]  The time for me just bashing police is over.
[01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.859]  And we've all got to come together.
[01:04:36.859 --> 01:04:38.940]  This is real, folks.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.000]  This is real.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.501]  We're going into revolution.
[01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:46.303]  And the system is going to counter-revolt against the people who are peacefully saying no.
[01:04:46.303 --> 01:04:49.605]  The globalists, I guarantee you already have it in the pike.
[01:04:49.605 --> 01:04:52.847]  Already in the works to stage terror attacks to blame on patriots.
[01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:54.587]  They've already got new wars.
[01:04:54.587 --> 01:04:57.689]  Mark Fiber, the top economist, is saying the same thing.
[01:04:57.689 --> 01:04:59.069]  Congressmen are saying it.
[01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.790]  This is real.
[01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:04.533]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:06.534]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:05:06.534 --> 01:05:15.059]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:05:15.059 --> 01:05:20.602]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:20.602 --> 01:05:22.223]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:22.463 --> 01:05:28.987]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:28.987 --> 01:05:40.034]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:40.494]  That's right.
[01:05:40.794 --> 01:05:43.357]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.180]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:45.440]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.003]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:05:48.003 --> 01:05:48.644]  That's Ecolablue.com.
[01:06:00.077 --> 01:06:01.457]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.458]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:04.438]  Well, you should.
[01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:08.940]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.740]  That's right.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:18.403]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:19.744]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:19.744 --> 01:06:20.904]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:06:21.104 --> 01:06:27.087]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:06:27.087 --> 01:06:33.991]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:39.514]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:40.975]  This is real.
[01:06:40.975 --> 01:06:42.015]  Don't miss out.
[01:06:42.015 --> 01:06:48.879]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:49.119 --> 01:06:50.581]  And get your free handgun.
[01:06:50.581 --> 01:06:52.945]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:06:52.945 --> 01:06:56.630]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.555]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:07:00.776 --> 01:07:05.298]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:07:05.298 --> 01:07:07.859]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:07:07.859 --> 01:07:08.740]  He was devastated.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:17.543]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:07:17.543 --> 01:07:23.746]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:07:23.746 --> 01:07:26.447]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:07:26.447 --> 01:07:28.809]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:07:29.889 --> 01:07:30.109]  I think so.
[01:07:52.637 --> 01:07:54.139]  OwnMyself.com.
[01:07:54.139 --> 01:07:57.905]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:07:57.905 --> 01:08:01.190]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:06.759]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.964 --> 01:08:37.549]  We've got Stuart Rhodes with us for the rest of the hour, but I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour to talk about governors, congressmen in the mainstream news saying that Obama may use the flu outbreak as a pretext for martial law.
[01:08:37.549 --> 01:08:46.092]  Then we have Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense have now approached Congress and said they want to put 400,000 regular army on the streets of America.
[01:08:46.092 --> 01:08:46.792]  This is all
[01:08:48.251 --> 01:08:50.452]  Off the charts serious.
[01:08:50.452 --> 01:09:02.434]  Meanwhile, two Spanish TV stations, including National, are calling for my arrest for racism, for putting up, telling people to put up posters in legal areas.
[01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:05.155]  I always thought light poles were where everybody else does.
[01:09:05.155 --> 01:09:08.336]  Obama told his people to put them on stop signs in the Washington Post.
[01:09:08.336 --> 01:09:09.956]  Posters that made him look in a good light.
[01:09:11.414 --> 01:09:13.996]  We said put it up under your local laws and legal areas.
[01:09:13.996 --> 01:09:15.897]  They're calling for my arrest.
[01:09:15.897 --> 01:09:22.322]  I have the Orlando News here saying they're trying to arrest people, trying to get indictments.
[01:09:22.322 --> 01:09:26.465]  I mean, America's going to hell in a handbasket here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:36.632]  You're not even supposed to be able to put up a sign or wear a t-shirt and they're saying that I need to be arrested for racism and a hate crime.
[01:09:36.632 --> 01:09:40.135]  And now they're saying if you use the word socialist, it's a hate crime.
[01:09:41.656 --> 01:09:45.481]  That's what the hate crime bill that passed the House and is now in the Senate says.
[01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.685]  That if you hurt someone's feelings, you're arrested and put in prison.
[01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.167]  Not even if a crime's committed.
[01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:51.609]  Hurting feelings.
[01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:52.290]  Well, you know what?
[01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:53.312]  We're selling the t-shirt.
[01:09:54.892 --> 01:09:56.494]  That says socialism on it.
[01:09:56.494 --> 01:09:58.436]  We sell one that says fascism on it.
[01:09:58.436 --> 01:10:00.918]  We sell one that says Infowars.com on it.
[01:10:00.918 --> 01:10:03.221]  One that says New World Order.
[01:10:03.221 --> 01:10:10.468]  The mainstream media is giving us credit saying that we started the entire Obama Joker thing.
[01:10:10.468 --> 01:10:14.272]  Well, number one, I'd be proud if I'd started this a month ago in LA.
[01:10:14.272 --> 01:10:14.552]  I didn't.
[01:10:15.373 --> 01:10:18.415]  Two weeks ago when they said, censor whoever's doing this.
[01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.037]  They need to be arrested.
[01:10:20.037 --> 01:10:20.857]  They're criminals.
[01:10:20.857 --> 01:10:22.439]  They're racist.
[01:10:22.439 --> 01:10:24.640]  I said, no, it's saying he's a criminal.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.862]  And people did this to Bush.
[01:10:26.862 --> 01:10:32.847]  And so, people need to post more of these in legal and lawful places.
[01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:45.948]  In the Commons area, under common law, you see the posters all over downtown or you see 20 posters on a pole, you can put a poster up and if they come selectively enforced against you, that's a big civil rights violation.
[01:10:45.948 --> 01:10:47.809]  It's just flat wrong, man!
[01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:49.051]  It's hypocrisy!
[01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:51.611]  And people are seeing through this.
[01:10:51.611 --> 01:10:56.615]  90 plus percent of the post and all these newspaper articles, all these TV stories, go read them for yourself.
[01:10:56.615 --> 01:10:59.157]  We have them linked on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:59.157 --> 01:11:06.783]  I mean, there's probably 10, 15, 20 posts saying how ridiculous the hypocrisy is and way to go putting the posters up.
[01:11:06.783 --> 01:11:18.772]  Now, I am seeing people post videos on YouTube where since the cops started threatening people and saying this is wrong, they're actually going to post offices and going to police stations and putting them on them.
[01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:19.373]  Don't do that.
[01:11:20.259 --> 01:11:21.300]  Have your First Amendment.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.242]  Put it where other people put posters.
[01:11:24.242 --> 01:11:25.583]  Put it in the downtown areas.
[01:11:25.583 --> 01:11:26.864]  Put it on bulletin boards.
[01:11:26.864 --> 01:11:30.946]  Give them to people.
[01:11:30.946 --> 01:11:35.149]  But I... I mean, that's what our founding fathers actually did go and put stuff on.
[01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:36.250]  Redcoat police stations.
[01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.152]  They actually did do stuff like that.
[01:11:38.152 --> 01:11:43.675]  They do stuff like burn images of the redcoats, you know, out front the police station.
[01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:43.976]  And then...
[01:11:47.552 --> 01:11:51.676]  If the Redcoats beat somebody up, they'd stop the Redcoats on the road and beat them up.
[01:11:51.676 --> 01:11:52.938]  I'm not calling for any of that.
[01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:53.798]  That's evil.
[01:11:53.798 --> 01:11:56.161]  That's founding father type stuff.
[01:11:56.161 --> 01:12:02.868]  And I'm being somewhat sarcastic, but seriously, I don't want that to happen because the establishment wants violence to break out.
[01:12:02.868 --> 01:12:05.050]  Now, enough said about that.
[01:12:06.078 --> 01:12:07.799]  We've now put up a t-shirt.
[01:12:07.799 --> 01:12:09.100]  These are in.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:09.800]  These are selling.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.000]  We have these in stock.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.582]  We're now manufacturing today.
[01:12:13.582 --> 01:12:15.062]  We have a three-day turnaround.
[01:12:15.062 --> 01:12:17.344]  So today, Saturday, and then Monday.
[01:12:17.344 --> 01:12:19.445]  By Tuesday, we'll have these t-shirts.
[01:12:19.445 --> 01:12:25.628]  We've made a Bush fascist to show that it is nonpartisan and that
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.020]  That we're equal opportunity offenders.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:34.362]  But, under the First Amendment, if we just want to criticize Obama, that's our right as well.
[01:12:34.362 --> 01:12:40.344]  And so, here is the poster, and everybody can get this t-shirt, it says InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:12:40.344 --> 01:12:44.865]  But all the Obama ones are available at InfoWars.com, and get them while you can.
[01:12:44.865 --> 01:12:49.367]  Lord knows they may just go ahead and make all this illegal, and I'm not joking about that.
[01:12:49.367 --> 01:12:52.628]  So I want to get Stewart Rhodes' take on that coming up, but not yet.
[01:12:52.628 --> 01:12:53.988]  We're going to open the phones up, too, at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:02.671]  I know some stations just joined us in the second hour, that's why I'm recapping some top stories.
[01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:11.073]  The Progressive newspaper is reporting, magazine is reporting, the Pentagon wants the authority to boost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[01:13:11.073 --> 01:13:16.895]  This is directly from the Congressional record, in violation of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:13:16.895 --> 01:13:25.017]  They've already announced 20,000 troops under Brigade Homeland, suddenly from California to Tennessee to upstate New York, from Schenectady, New York,
[01:13:26.098 --> 01:13:32.154]  uh... to uh... arcadia iowa army regular army national guard marines
[01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:43.065]  State guards are running checkpoints, searching people, actually arresting people, running DWI checkpoints, things that are seen as popular to acclimate the public.
[01:13:43.065 --> 01:13:46.246]  And they admit this is for domestic operations.
[01:13:46.246 --> 01:13:50.947]  In the Homeland Security documents we broke that we got from people inside Homeland Security.
[01:13:50.947 --> 01:13:55.288]  In the Department of Defense documents we broke that were later confirmed mainstream news.
[01:13:55.288 --> 01:14:01.030]  In the secret clergy response teams and InfraGard documents we broke that were years later confirmed to be real.
[01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:06.692]  I know they're real, they come directly from sources.
[01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:15.157]  Massachusetts deputizes Dennis Paramedics Pharmacist to administer flu vaccine, Boston Globe, for forced inoculations.
[01:14:15.157 --> 01:14:23.721]  We have another one here where the congressman is in the news saying that they are preparing for
[01:14:26.192 --> 01:14:31.313]  Total martial law and using this as the cover to do that.
[01:14:31.313 --> 01:14:34.474]  I'm looking for it here in my stack.
[01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:35.794]  I'll find it in a moment.
[01:14:35.794 --> 01:14:37.915]  There's just too many of these to keep track of.
[01:14:37.915 --> 01:14:47.897]  German News is reporting there is live cancer viruses in the main vaccine that's being distributed.
[01:14:47.897 --> 01:14:53.899]  So that's why we've got Oath Keepers on and Stuart Rhodes, the founder of it, with us today.
[01:14:53.899 --> 01:14:55.459]  We're going to go to him.
[01:14:57.082 --> 01:15:00.624]  Because Mr. Rhodes started Oath Keepers.
[01:15:00.624 --> 01:15:06.047]  He was a high-level aide in Ron Paul's congressional office in his presidential campaign.
[01:15:06.047 --> 01:15:07.747]  He's an ex-Army.
[01:15:07.747 --> 01:15:10.429]  Stuart Rhodes is the founder and director of Oath Keepers.
[01:15:11.488 --> 01:15:20.511]  Military veterans and peace officers who will honor their oaths to defend the Constitution, will not just follow orders, will stand up for liberty and will save the Republic, so help us God.
[01:15:20.511 --> 01:15:31.435]  Our motto is, not on our watch, it's a non-partisan association of currently serving military reserves, National Guard, peace officers, veterans who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:15:31.435 --> 01:15:39.518]  And he is a Yale Law School graduate and was an Army officer in... Well, I mean, give us your exact bio, Stuart.
[01:15:40.316 --> 01:15:41.197]  No, I was a paratrooper.
[01:15:41.197 --> 01:15:42.238]  I was an enlisted man.
[01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:43.380]  I worked for a living.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.283]  But I was a paratrooper until I was disabled in a parachuting accident.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:02.041]  Mixing us in with white supremacists, UFO cults, you name it.
[01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:07.223]  And specifically, they attack us together here in this piece.
[01:16:07.223 --> 01:16:08.583]  Go ahead.
[01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:09.203]  Yes, they do.
[01:16:09.203 --> 01:16:10.304]  You bet.
[01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:22.208]  They quote our interview, in fact, where they say that Roach told conspiracy-minded radio host Alex Jones, imagine if we focused on the police and military, and came over for the new world order.
[01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:23.748]  And I want to thank them for pulling that quote out.
[01:16:23.748 --> 01:16:24.668]  I forgot about that.
[01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:25.609]  I think it's a pretty good quote.
[01:16:27.304 --> 01:16:30.665]  But no, they're doing the same thing they've done throughout the last few decades.
[01:16:30.665 --> 01:16:39.708]  Anybody who gets to be a threat to the orthodox, their orthodox plans, they will attack and try to smear and lump in with racists.
[01:16:39.708 --> 01:16:43.409]  Or they tell you you're racist because a black president's in office, you must be racist.
[01:16:43.409 --> 01:16:55.292]  You oppose anything he does, or you're completely insane, and therefore the government should monitor you, should investigate you, should have a secret file on you, and then should go arrest you if it can.
[01:16:57.389 --> 01:17:01.613]  Did you see the comments in the article where they say that we need to be killed?
[01:17:01.613 --> 01:17:02.954]  Have you seen that yet?
[01:17:02.954 --> 01:17:04.355]  No, I haven't seen that yet.
[01:17:04.355 --> 01:17:05.937]  No, I have not.
[01:17:05.937 --> 01:17:09.961]  But I saw something on the Alan Combs Show, which was a really horrible interview.
[01:17:09.961 --> 01:17:16.827]  All he wanted to do was accuse me of being sensationalistic and paranoid.
[01:17:16.827 --> 01:17:20.030]  But he had comments on his own side that were pretty atrocious, too.
[01:17:21.479 --> 01:17:31.002]  Well, I mean, the Louisville newspapers, the AP and others are reporting, I'm going to dig them out and cover them coming up, as soon as I find them, they are
[01:17:32.591 --> 01:17:39.597]  Congressman Brown is saying this is being used for martial law, that Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[01:17:39.597 --> 01:17:48.165]  We have now the Pentagon publicly saying they want to deploy 400,000 regular army on the streets of America.
[01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:52.328]  I mean, this is an occupation rivaling Baghdad.
[01:17:52.328 --> 01:17:53.790]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:17:55.046 --> 01:18:01.488]  Yeah, well, tipping over to the blue idea, that has always been the one thing that people throw back at us about our channel work.
[01:18:01.488 --> 01:18:03.009]  They say, what about a pandemic?
[01:18:03.009 --> 01:18:09.811]  And so I can't think of a stronger pretext short of a dude going off to American City for trying to declare martial law.
[01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:12.912]  But as you know, martial law has no constitutional basis whatsoever.
[01:18:12.912 --> 01:18:16.653]  So I get sick and tired of hearing all these politicians throwing around the word martial law.
[01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:18.214]  They have no idea what they're talking about.
[01:18:18.214 --> 01:18:20.534]  Martial law is the absolute absence of the law.
[01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:22.295]  It's the will of the commander on the battlefield.
[01:18:22.719 --> 01:18:33.787]  And nowhere in our Constitution is there some kind of escape clause that says, when the weather's bad, you can suspend the Second Amendment like they did in Katrina, or if there's a flu outbreak, you can suspend the Constitution and impose martial law.
[01:18:33.787 --> 01:18:35.308]  It doesn't exist.
[01:18:35.308 --> 01:18:39.371]  And so when you look at Article 4, Section 4, that's your answer right there.
[01:18:39.371 --> 01:18:40.572]  What's it say right there?
[01:18:40.572 --> 01:18:45.796]  It says that the national government shall secure to the states a Republican form of government.
[01:18:48.732 --> 01:18:49.312]  We're good to go.
[01:19:08.382 --> 01:19:11.023]  Can the federal government come into a state?
[01:19:11.023 --> 01:19:18.385]  And so that's my first stop when it comes to the constitutionality of any of these plans that NORTHCOM, FEMA, DHS have.
[01:19:18.385 --> 01:19:21.746]  If they're acting as though the states don't exist anymore.
[01:19:21.746 --> 01:19:32.189]  Well, the issue, too, is everything should be set up around the state responding because the locals can always spend the money the best and they can also respond the best.
[01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:34.250]  That's been the way we've always operated.
[01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.911]  I mean, Congress can't even read its own bills.
[01:19:37.651 --> 01:19:38.892]  And look at Katrina.
[01:19:38.892 --> 01:19:40.132]  How are they going to respond?
[01:19:40.132 --> 01:19:48.517]  No, they're going to use disasters as a pretext to come in and confiscate guns and loot the wealthy houses, as happened in Katrina.
[01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.978]  Stay there, Stuart Rhodes, with Oath Keepers.
[01:19:50.978 --> 01:19:57.402]  Thousands and thousands of military and police taking the oath to not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to upkeep their oath.
[01:19:57.402 --> 01:19:58.022]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:07.990]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.
[01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:11.034]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:20:11.034 --> 01:20:15.841]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:16.502]  I think so.
[01:20:33.425 --> 01:20:33.986]  It is a big idea
[01:21:03.604 --> 01:21:05.385]  A New World Order!
[01:21:05.385 --> 01:21:10.286]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:21:10.286 --> 01:21:13.107]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:13.107 --> 01:21:15.888]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:21:15.888 --> 01:21:19.068]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:19.068 --> 01:21:26.391]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:29.434 --> 01:21:34.856]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:38.737]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:38.737 --> 01:21:41.298]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:41.298 --> 01:21:42.458]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:42.458 --> 01:21:43.238]  They're not after money.
[01:21:43.238 --> 01:21:44.539]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:45.499]  They're after power.
[01:21:45.499 --> 01:21:46.659]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:23:00.663 --> 01:23:09.727]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[01:23:55.319 --> 01:24:13.894]  Stewart Rhodes, he started Oath Keepers, what, in the last year or so, and it's really exploded in size.
[01:24:13.894 --> 01:24:17.257]  We'll give you the website before he leaves us and some of the testimonials.
[01:24:20.154 --> 01:24:22.515]  The government is clearly out of line.
[01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:24.555]  It's violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:24:24.555 --> 01:24:26.616]  It's run by foreign offshore banks.
[01:24:26.616 --> 01:24:30.958]  They've stolen almost $24 trillion the last 10 months.
[01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:35.259]  Obama has proven he's a liar on every front.
[01:24:35.259 --> 01:24:46.903]  And then magically, they put out DHS reports saying that all these evil American gun owners are about to attack the President.
[01:24:48.189 --> 01:25:02.792]  And right on cue, the Southern Poverty Law Center comes out with a report demonizing all these good people, mixing us in with clearly bad folks, and then now ABC News is doing it, and I saw this before Oklahoma City.
[01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:09.553]  So before the feds stage terror attacks so that they can be the victims and clamp down on freedom, they do this.
[01:25:09.553 --> 01:25:11.593]  This is the preparatory phase.
[01:25:11.593 --> 01:25:14.114]  Stewart, do you smell a false flag in the wind?
[01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:21.467]  I think we're heading to the territory where they could use a pretext such as the flu itself.
[01:25:21.467 --> 01:25:27.511]  This appears to be what they're doing, setting up all the infrastructure and all the planning and all the rhetoric.
[01:25:28.143 --> 01:25:35.726]  So that all you have to do is click the button, click the switch, and the blue pops up and the next thing you know that they've imposed martial law.
[01:25:35.726 --> 01:25:44.650]  I want to go back to a second where we were talking about it a minute ago, you're right, about the first line, as I said, should be that the state should have to get permission.
[01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:53.114]  But then you look at Article 1, Section 8 also says that Congress has the power to call forth a militia to execute the law of the Union, suppress insurrection, and rebel invasion.
[01:25:53.797 --> 01:25:59.083]  It's not just a good idea for the state to be in charge, but the founders had the answer.
[01:25:59.083 --> 01:26:04.208]  The answer to the question of who should guard the guardians was that we ourselves, the people, would be the guardians.
[01:26:04.208 --> 01:26:04.989]  It's not state militia.
[01:26:05.486 --> 01:26:24.835]  And then your legislature, and then your legislature that you've elected is in charge, so when you see troops coming down the street, they are from your town, your city, you know their daddy, you know their mama, or you might even be their granddaddy, and the legislature commanding them, the governor commanding them, you voted for them.
[01:26:24.835 --> 01:26:26.736]  That is the people ruling.
[01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:36.522]  And only, you can only have outside militia from somewhere else if that legislature in your state, your governor, invites them in.
[01:26:36.522 --> 01:26:37.243]  Okay?
[01:26:37.243 --> 01:26:40.989]  And nothing there is contemplating the standing army doing anything inside the United States.
[01:26:40.989 --> 01:26:42.391]  It's supposed to be the militia.
[01:26:44.054 --> 01:26:50.439]  That's right, the standing army defends the nation's borders and has a navy to defend, but it doesn't have any action inside.
[01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:52.901]  Have you seen the editorial cartoon of the United States?
[01:26:52.901 --> 01:26:57.384]  It's his homeland security with all the cannons swung in pointing inside the country?
[01:26:57.384 --> 01:26:59.025]  And that's what's happening.
[01:26:59.025 --> 01:27:02.207]  Everything that Bush created is now being turned inward.
[01:27:02.207 --> 01:27:02.988]  All that infrastructure.
[01:27:03.965 --> 01:27:07.827]  And so we are so far from our, you know, the original intention of the Founders.
[01:27:07.827 --> 01:27:09.568]  Forget about the Boston Common Data Act.
[01:27:09.568 --> 01:27:10.808]  That's only a statute.
[01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:13.270]  Look at the design of the Constitution itself.
[01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:15.611]  We're wildly beyond what they intended.
[01:27:15.611 --> 01:27:19.833]  They wanted the militia of the state to be the internal security force.
[01:27:19.833 --> 01:27:20.853]  That'd be us.
[01:27:20.853 --> 01:27:22.174]  How are we going to interiorize ourselves?
[01:27:23.774 --> 01:27:24.155]  You can't.
[01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:25.096]  That was their insight.
[01:27:39.878 --> 01:27:43.401]  They want a clone, but a evil doppelganger.
[01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:48.725]  They want a twisted militia that's a federal militia, and they go, well, that's in the Constitution.
[01:27:48.725 --> 01:27:49.886]  So they try to have it both ways.
[01:27:49.886 --> 01:27:54.329]  They demonize a real militia, but then they have their counterfeit federal militia.
[01:27:54.329 --> 01:27:57.592]  Can you explain to people from the Constitution the difference?
[01:27:57.592 --> 01:27:58.072]  Well, sure.
[01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:04.417]  As the Constitution itself, a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state.
[01:28:04.417 --> 01:28:05.878]  The militias are from the states.
[01:28:06.883 --> 01:28:08.304]  Not from the national government.
[01:28:08.304 --> 01:28:09.566]  That's not a militia.
[01:28:09.566 --> 01:28:13.830]  When the national government hires someone to do anything, they are now part of a national government.
[01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:16.132]  They're not part of the state structure.
[01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:18.074]  And so it's entirely opposite, as you said.
[01:28:18.074 --> 01:28:21.017]  It's like the evil twin of a militia.
[01:28:21.017 --> 01:28:25.321]  It's more like the brown shirts or the Stasi.
[01:28:25.321 --> 01:28:27.263]  Exactly.
[01:28:27.263 --> 01:28:29.545]  The answer to the Stasi are the brown shirts.
[01:28:31.112 --> 01:28:33.135]  I hope that the Southern Poverty Law Center gets this quote.
[01:28:33.135 --> 01:28:37.100]  We are the opposite of the brown shirts, or the male brigades, the youth brigades.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:41.746]  This is the real people's army, not their wicked counterfeit.
[01:28:41.746 --> 01:28:42.107]  Go ahead.
[01:28:42.107 --> 01:28:43.609]  That's right.
[01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:46.052]  They're trying to create a new version
[01:28:48.194 --> 01:28:49.675]  You know, they're adopting the old forms.
[01:28:49.675 --> 01:28:50.536]  This is what happens.
[01:28:50.536 --> 01:28:53.638]  They'll adopt the old forms and they'll twist them.
[01:28:53.638 --> 01:28:56.479]  And it's something that this has done throughout history.
[01:28:56.479 --> 01:28:59.842]  Every oppressive regime always takes the law and turns it into a weapon.
[01:28:59.842 --> 01:29:02.743]  And they'll adopt the forms and bastardize them.
[01:29:02.743 --> 01:29:05.165]  And Orwell warned us about this many years ago.
[01:29:05.165 --> 01:29:06.966]  So it shouldn't be a surprise.
[01:29:06.966 --> 01:29:08.327]  But we have to be on guard.
[01:29:08.327 --> 01:29:11.009]  And the first line is your state sovereignty.
[01:29:11.009 --> 01:29:13.210]  You have to have... In fact, this is what needs to happen.
[01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:17.673]  State legislatures need to convene special sessions to discuss
[01:29:18.306 --> 01:29:27.666]  And to come to conclusions and pass resolutions about the claimed authority of NORTHCOM and FEMA and DHS to come into their state during a pandemic.
[01:29:28.832 --> 01:29:30.493]  Stuart, Stuart, we got a break.
[01:29:30.493 --> 01:29:34.334]  Let's come back and talk about that and then get into the First Amendment overall.
[01:29:34.334 --> 01:29:43.077]  But yes, we now have the Governor's Association sending a letter to the White House and the Pentagon saying, you're going to put troops on the streets?
[01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:45.858]  And the Army's answer is, yeah.
[01:29:45.858 --> 01:29:47.479]  It was 20,000 last year.
[01:29:47.479 --> 01:29:49.160]  Now it's 400,000.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.220]  Will it be a million next year?
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.621]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:55.162]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.162 --> 01:29:57.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:05.691]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:30.748 --> 01:30:31.408]  We're good.
[01:31:01.018 --> 01:31:04.021]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:09.346]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.346 --> 01:31:11.408]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.408 --> 01:31:16.413]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.413 --> 01:31:17.334]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.574 --> 01:31:18.695]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.695 --> 01:31:20.576]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.576 --> 01:31:21.657]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.657 --> 01:31:23.858]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.858 --> 01:31:25.199]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.199 --> 01:31:26.740]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:32.004]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.004 --> 01:31:35.586]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.586 --> 01:31:39.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.389 --> 01:31:40.610]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:41.530]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:42.631]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:43.551]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.551 --> 01:31:44.652]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.652 --> 01:31:47.714]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.714 --> 01:31:49.475]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.475 --> 01:31:50.395]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:01.499 --> 01:32:05.782]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:32:05.782 --> 01:32:09.025]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:32:09.025 --> 01:32:16.831]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[01:32:17.091 --> 01:32:19.332]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[01:32:19.332 --> 01:32:21.713]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[01:32:21.713 --> 01:32:28.517]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[01:32:28.517 --> 01:32:34.260]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:37.282]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[01:32:37.282 --> 01:32:45.068]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:52.894]  1-888-213-4338.
[01:33:03.766 --> 01:33:05.088]  We're good to go.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.301]  The globalists have a couple of things going for them.
[01:33:28.301 --> 01:33:29.821]  They've got the central government.
[01:33:29.821 --> 01:33:37.843]  They've got the unlimited power of the central banks to issue fiat, made-up currency.
[01:33:37.843 --> 01:33:49.447]  And their plan is so diabolical, so wicked, so corrupt, it's like wilder than a James Bond evil villain plot.
[01:33:49.447 --> 01:33:53.268]  I mean, the movie Moonraker about a plan to set up a world government and kill everybody,
[01:33:54.298 --> 01:33:59.661]  You know, they got the plots for that from real government documents, like Ecoscience.
[01:33:59.661 --> 01:34:05.144]  Fleming, the work for the MI6 that wrote the books, admitted that.
[01:34:05.144 --> 01:34:15.691]  And he did write Moonraker, under another name, but I forget the exact name of it, it wasn't Moonraker, but the point is that
[01:34:17.503 --> 01:34:21.505]  They've got that going for them, but once people find out, this is really true.
[01:34:21.505 --> 01:34:34.574]  I mean, when I get up on air and go, here's the Army purchase orders for FEMA camps, here's the Army hiring people for domestic internment and resettlement programs, you know, here's the actual code on it.
[01:34:34.574 --> 01:34:46.261]  When I show you mainstream news articles, this is out of The Hill, a big major newspaper in D.C., and it says, Governors Oppose DOD Emergency Powers.
[01:34:47.588 --> 01:34:51.130]  And they sent a letter, the heads of the Governor's Association, saying, what is this?
[01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:54.092]  You can't federalize the states and put troops on the streets.
[01:34:54.092 --> 01:35:00.576]  They were responding to what now has come out in the news.
[01:35:00.576 --> 01:35:03.417]  And that is these reports out of the AP and the Progressive.
[01:35:03.417 --> 01:35:08.640]  Governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.882]  And then that other headline I was mentioning
[01:35:11.934 --> 01:35:19.016]  Earlier, the Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[01:35:19.016 --> 01:35:25.617]  And then I've got articles here where they're training to take over the cities and admitting that they're going to do it.
[01:35:25.617 --> 01:35:28.778]  In fact, I had that here in my stack.
[01:35:28.778 --> 01:35:33.259]  National Guard takes over school and swine flu vaccine riot drill.
[01:35:34.039 --> 01:35:49.627]  And then I can go back a few years and pull up stuff like the Pensacola News Journal, where the Marines unannounced take over the middle school, point guns at the kids' heads, the kids think it's real, and then the Marines say, oh, the president wants you to know what martial law is like.
[01:35:49.627 --> 01:35:50.808]  That was in the newspaper.
[01:35:51.348 --> 01:35:54.651]  Folks, this is a real program going on.
[01:35:54.651 --> 01:36:05.181]  Stuart Rhodes, with all of this backdrop happening, and then we've got the Southern Poverty Law Center coming out and viciously attacking you and I and others, nationally.
[01:36:05.181 --> 01:36:11.087]  I mean, this report is being one of the top news stories the last three days on every major newscast.
[01:36:12.907 --> 01:36:23.610]  Does that creep you out but at the same time make you proud that you're actually having an effect to know that over and over again, myself especially, get singled out as this enemy?
[01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:30.092]  I mean, the full government focus is on us and trying to demonize these town halls.
[01:36:31.203 --> 01:36:31.843]  That's right.
[01:36:31.843 --> 01:36:33.004]  I mean, here's the bottom line.
[01:36:33.004 --> 01:36:34.945]  This is why I founded Oath Keepers in the first place.
[01:36:34.945 --> 01:36:36.366]  The head is rotten.
[01:36:36.366 --> 01:36:41.009]  We have to focus from the bottom up, from the county level on up, and our state legislatures.
[01:36:41.009 --> 01:36:46.933]  But then we might run out of time, and that's why I founded Oath Keepers, to be sure that, or at least do the best we can.
[01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:48.353]  Well, you just made a great point.
[01:37:11.266 --> 01:37:30.485]  When we've got the government documents attacking us and attacking Ron Paul and attacking libertarians and attacking returning veterans and gun owners, that is absolute proof that they are bad and that our analysis of their system was correct and that my only apology is, Mr. Rhodes, is that I...
[01:37:31.025 --> 01:37:38.612]  As bad as I said it was, I haven't told the audience and fully grasped myself just how real this is.
[01:37:38.612 --> 01:37:42.195]  I mean, intellectually knowing something is happening.
[01:37:42.195 --> 01:37:44.277]  Intellectually knowing it hurts to be in a car wreck.
[01:37:46.215 --> 01:37:55.059]  And you know, flip your car is one thing, but actually being in the car, breaking your ribs, knocking your head out, you know, the window, getting 20 stitches is another thing.
[01:37:55.059 --> 01:38:03.383]  You know, I mean, intellectually, I know getting the flu doesn't feel good, but when you're actually vomiting your guts out, it's a different thing.
[01:38:03.383 --> 01:38:04.363]  Can you comment on that?
[01:38:04.363 --> 01:38:05.784]  I mean, to actually see this happening.
[01:38:06.542 --> 01:38:07.202]  Absolutely.
[01:38:07.202 --> 01:38:21.710]  Look back at HR 1955, Jane Harman's proposal of the Radical Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, where they wanted to set up centers of excellence to study people and give secret reports to Congress.
[01:38:21.710 --> 01:38:22.471]  Remember that?
[01:38:22.471 --> 01:38:25.953]  And she introduced that on April 19, 2007.
[01:38:25.953 --> 01:38:29.755]  Because even back then, her real target was domestic enemies.
[01:38:30.712 --> 01:38:33.114]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that's like a police code.
[01:38:33.114 --> 01:38:36.716]  When they say April 19th, that's when the war started.
[01:38:36.716 --> 01:38:37.477]  Explain that to people.
[01:38:38.194 --> 01:38:38.614]  Oh, you bet.
[01:38:38.614 --> 01:38:48.279]  I mean, we stood in the green in Lexington April 19th, this last April, to commemorate, you know, as all kinds of citizens do, to celebrate our heritage and also to reaffirm our oath.
[01:38:48.279 --> 01:39:01.427]  But according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, that's a kind of sinister indication that we are extremists, because supposedly April 19th is equivalent to celebrating Oklahoma City's blowing up of the Oklahoma City building.
[01:39:01.427 --> 01:39:05.929]  So, you know, in their mind, if you do anything April 19th, it makes you an extremist.
[01:39:05.929 --> 01:39:06.489]  Not in America.
[01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:14.013]  The globalists hate America, that's why they burned Waco on April 19th and used special forces against those children.
[01:39:14.013 --> 01:39:17.074]  We have the congressional documents with Delta Force there.
[01:39:17.074 --> 01:39:22.736]  And that's why they bombed Oklahoma City on April 19th, was to take that day away from us.
[01:39:22.736 --> 01:39:29.919]  They want to take our sacred days and expropriate them and turn it into a day of victimization for their red coat system.
[01:39:31.072 --> 01:39:32.413]  Well, they want to demonize it.
[01:39:32.413 --> 01:39:34.614]  They want to erase our own history.
[01:39:34.614 --> 01:39:35.654]  So here's what's happening.
[01:39:35.654 --> 01:39:39.856]  What she wanted to do is being done anyway, even though the bill didn't pass.
[01:39:39.856 --> 01:39:43.578]  And Southern Poverty Law Center is just another facet of that.
[01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:52.362]  They are acting as the Gestapo secret police wing to go and label people, instead of having the FBI do it directly.
[01:39:52.922 --> 01:39:53.963]  They do it for them.
[01:39:53.963 --> 01:39:58.509]  And then DHS feeds off of their fake little reports and comes up with their own report.
[01:39:58.509 --> 01:40:03.434]  And then you've got the Department of Law Center deciding the DHS report they helped write.
[01:40:03.434 --> 01:40:07.399]  I mean, it's a suspicious circle like a puppeteer with two puppets in his hand.
[01:40:07.399 --> 01:40:08.520]  It's all the same puppet master.
[01:40:09.249 --> 01:40:12.713]  Well, that's what Hitler did, that's what Lenin did, that's what Mao did.
[01:40:12.713 --> 01:40:15.515]  First, for four or five years, in every case, they demonize the group, then they go after you.
[01:40:31.952 --> 01:40:40.178]  And, you know, we got the secret army document that regular army is watching us and Ron Paul, and that became national news.
[01:40:40.178 --> 01:40:46.243]  The good news is, though, it's backfiring because the military is going, why am I spying on Wayne Paul?
[01:40:46.863 --> 01:40:48.524]  Why am I spying on Alex Jones?
[01:40:48.524 --> 01:40:50.626]  Why am I spying on Ron Paul?
[01:40:50.626 --> 01:40:52.828]  Why am I spying on Stuart Rhodes?
[01:40:52.828 --> 01:40:59.473]  Why are we following around some little old lady that's handing out yard signs to end the Fed?
[01:40:59.473 --> 01:41:07.860]  I mean, I really think the establishment is trying to do the same thing the bankers funded in Russia and China and Germany, and I don't see it working.
[01:41:09.164 --> 01:41:11.485]  It's not about backfiring.
[01:41:11.485 --> 01:41:13.186]  It becomes absurd.
[01:41:13.186 --> 01:41:20.949]  Anybody who disagrees with what's going on, or anybody who you can categorize as being anywhere on the political right, is now a potential terrorist.
[01:41:20.949 --> 01:41:22.330]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:29.372]  The extremist lexicon defined an extremist as being a terrorist, and then it went down the list of all these so-called extremist groups.
[01:41:29.372 --> 01:41:31.433]  So we're all automatically terrorists.
[01:41:31.433 --> 01:41:32.854]  We're just different stripes of terrorists.
[01:41:33.214 --> 01:41:36.657]  This person's an anti-abortion terrorist.
[01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:41.781]  This person here is an anti-abortion or anti-free border terrorist.
[01:41:41.781 --> 01:41:43.902]  So they label you different kinds of terrorists.
[01:41:43.902 --> 01:41:49.847]  But they pull us all together in one big giant pool of extremists, which means terrorists.
[01:41:49.847 --> 01:41:55.772]  And so it's so broad and so sweeping that anyone can see through it and see how ridiculous it really is.
[01:41:55.772 --> 01:41:57.513]  Unless they're a partisan hack.
[01:41:57.513 --> 01:42:00.635]  Well, Stuart, you also noticed that everybody they list in that DHS report
[01:42:02.836 --> 01:42:23.722]  are people that are following something that's constitutional and it happens to be popular eighty one percent gallup poll control the borders demonized almost eighty percent say risk i get rid of restricted gun laws we're winning that fight we're terrorist uh... upwards of seventy percent now are against abortion so the majority of us are terrorists uh... this is an unpopular
[01:42:24.707 --> 01:42:29.592]  Well, it's like national polls show 92% believe the government killed Kennedy now.
[01:42:29.592 --> 01:42:33.977]  I mean, so 8% is saying 92% of us are nuts or terrorists.
[01:42:33.977 --> 01:42:35.979]  It isn't going to work anymore.
[01:42:35.979 --> 01:42:41.144]  I mean, look, the feds might have been able to get away with blowing up their own federal building in 95.
[01:42:41.144 --> 01:42:43.106]  They might have been able to get away with that now.
[01:42:43.106 --> 01:42:47.030]  I want to caution the black op operators and the mercenaries and others.
[01:42:47.831 --> 01:42:52.273]  Cheney's been caught for staging terror in the Middle East to blame it on enemies.
[01:42:52.273 --> 01:42:53.974]  It's coming out about Blackwater.
[01:42:53.974 --> 01:42:59.717]  You guys aren't going to get away with this because there's people on the inside that are going to blow the whistle from so many angles.
[01:42:59.717 --> 01:43:00.918]  You're going to get caught.
[01:43:00.918 --> 01:43:06.041]  And I really, Stewart, feel, but also intellectually see, the momentum has shifted.
[01:43:06.041 --> 01:43:09.363]  Now for leaders like you and myself, they may imprison us or kill us, but
[01:43:10.063 --> 01:43:13.344]  We're actually fighting for America in the final battle.
[01:43:13.344 --> 01:43:15.584]  I mean, in the main crossroads.
[01:43:15.584 --> 01:43:16.564]  So I'm not even worried about it.
[01:43:16.564 --> 01:43:17.325]  It's a great honor.
[01:43:17.325 --> 01:43:18.925]  I wish I had more lives to give.
[01:43:18.925 --> 01:43:26.467]  But for the people out there, if you simply take action, get the word out, expose the globalists, I don't see us being able to be defeated.
[01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:31.548]  Even if they blow up federal buildings, even if the feds set off a nuke, even if they release some deadly flu.
[01:43:31.548 --> 01:43:33.848]  Stewart, I've looked at this from every angle.
[01:43:33.848 --> 01:43:36.789]  If the people believe they can win, it's over.
[01:43:36.789 --> 01:43:37.109]  We win.
[01:43:38.937 --> 01:43:46.284]  Absolutely, and here's the thing, if we wake up enough of the police and military, as I said in that prior interview, then it's game over for them.
[01:43:46.284 --> 01:43:53.650]  You can't do these things without the willing compliance of the troops, of the police.
[01:43:53.650 --> 01:44:00.036]  If they have them on their side, then it's still not over for us, we can still fight, but certainly it's better for us to have our brothers and sisters
[01:44:02.452 --> 01:44:03.492]  You know, on our side.
[01:44:03.492 --> 01:44:06.053]  So we have to make sure we get as many of them as possible.
[01:44:06.053 --> 01:44:07.214]  And that's our mission.
[01:44:07.214 --> 01:44:14.697]  And our next big push now is going to be to put an Oath Keeper packet, including an Oath Keeper's guidebook, and a tab we can put on their uniform.
[01:44:14.697 --> 01:44:17.338]  We want to get those out to every single service member.
[01:44:17.338 --> 01:44:22.120]  So we're going to be doing a big money wave between now and November 11th, which is the Veterans Day.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:28.903]  And it's going to go into a distinct fund where people can just donate $30, and it will go right to, in the hands of a service member, current serving.
[01:44:28.903 --> 01:44:31.344]  They'll know that every time they do that, it's going to end that result.
[01:44:31.964 --> 01:44:36.706]  And it's Oath-Keepers.blogspot.com.
[01:44:36.706 --> 01:44:39.567]  We have a new website, OathKeepers.org.
[01:44:39.567 --> 01:44:41.288]  OathKeepers.org.
[01:44:41.288 --> 01:44:42.729]  We'll also get that up.
[01:44:42.729 --> 01:44:49.912]  I want to go to some phone calls, Stuart, in the time we have left for you, but I did want to mention the Joker posters.
[01:44:49.912 --> 01:44:51.252]  These were put up in California.
[01:44:51.252 --> 01:44:55.454]  Then Mark Dice had his own contest, so I copied him, did a contest.
[01:44:56.781 --> 01:44:59.664]  But a few people put these on post office boxes.
[01:44:59.664 --> 01:45:00.164]  Big deal.
[01:45:00.164 --> 01:45:02.806]  But they're saying, oh, big federal felony terrorism.
[01:45:02.806 --> 01:45:08.131]  Now they're saying it's an act of terror and abusive and there's victims.
[01:45:08.131 --> 01:45:15.678]  If you even put it up where other posters are, they're saying the poster itself is racist, that it's a hate crime to say socialism.
[01:45:15.678 --> 01:45:16.338]  I'm not kidding.
[01:45:16.338 --> 01:45:17.740]  That's in the news.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.083]  And they have people on the news saying, I need to be arrested.
[01:45:21.083 --> 01:45:23.585]  That's content-based discrimination.
[01:45:24.602 --> 01:45:28.124]  It's content-based targeting, because like you just said, they're targeting the content.
[01:45:28.124 --> 01:45:30.466]  They're not, it's not content-neutral.
[01:45:30.466 --> 01:45:31.666]  That's unconstitutional.
[01:45:31.666 --> 01:45:34.128]  Yeah, because you're a constitutional lawyer, I was going to ask your opinion.
[01:45:34.128 --> 01:45:37.650]  So, I mean, that's the, so clearly this is discrimination then.
[01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:42.953]  Oh sure, even at the ACLU, they'll tell you the same thing, I hope, is that it's clearly content-based.
[01:45:42.953 --> 01:45:46.476]  I mean, are they doing the same thing to everybody else but the buyer?
[01:45:46.476 --> 01:45:47.036]  No, they're not.
[01:45:47.628 --> 01:45:49.369]  So it's based on your content.
[01:45:49.369 --> 01:45:50.389]  That's unconstitutional.
[01:45:50.389 --> 01:45:52.130]  I don't care what you're saying.
[01:45:52.130 --> 01:46:00.173]  You can have the Klan putting up a swastika, and if they are singled out because of the content, that's also content-based discrimination.
[01:46:00.173 --> 01:46:05.235]  That's why the ACLU defended the Klan's right to march through Skokie, Illinois.
[01:46:05.235 --> 01:46:10.637]  As painful and horrible as that was, it was to protect the principle that you don't discriminate on content.
[01:46:12.179 --> 01:46:20.685]  Because the minute that the Klan, every one of them federal officers, I've been to these events to protest them, I mean, it's just feds, period.
[01:46:20.685 --> 01:46:35.274]  And it's come out over and over again, it's feds to demonize the Patriot Movement, because they'll get up there and give pro-Second Amendment speeches, they'll get up there and give anti-New World Order speeches, all to demonize us, and later it comes out they're feds or informants or, you know, the leaders are being paid to do it.
[01:46:35.274 --> 01:46:39.257]  But yeah, you take those big fat federal agents right away,
[01:46:40.177 --> 01:46:41.659]  You lose your right.
[01:46:41.659 --> 01:46:46.025]  And that's why these people sending me emails saying I deserve to go to prison.
[01:46:46.025 --> 01:46:49.450]  That just shows they haven't been teaching civics in the schools.
[01:46:50.216 --> 01:46:52.218]  No, they don't understand their own history.
[01:46:52.218 --> 01:46:57.363]  I mean, the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s would have gone nowhere if you could have content-based discrimination.
[01:46:57.363 --> 01:47:01.888]  That's why they resorted to peaceful marches, because they have a constitutional right.
[01:47:01.888 --> 01:47:09.755]  The First Amendment, sadly, the other parts of the Bill of Rights aren't as strongly protected, but the First Amendment's been pretty strongly protected.
[01:47:09.755 --> 01:47:11.938]  It's the most potent weapon we have, legally.
[01:47:12.772 --> 01:47:14.775]  As far as the level of protection for it.
[01:47:14.775 --> 01:47:16.077]  And you can thank the ACLU for that.
[01:47:16.077 --> 01:47:16.978]  They did some things right.
[01:47:26.423 --> 01:47:36.085]  What is their view on seeing all this classic, really Maoist, is the closest thing I would call it, tyranny manifesting?
[01:47:36.085 --> 01:47:38.966]  Are they redoubling their efforts to warn other military and police?
[01:47:38.966 --> 01:47:47.448]  I mean, clearly, if the government organs and government surrogates like Southern Poverty Law are coming after you, they are.
[01:47:47.448 --> 01:47:50.949]  But, I mean, what's the sense of the membership?
[01:47:51.707 --> 01:47:55.049]  Yes, it's making them all the more resolved.
[01:47:55.049 --> 01:48:02.512]  And, like you said earlier, it makes it clear that we are in the game now that we all had dreaded would be coming.
[01:48:02.512 --> 01:48:04.213]  It's happening to us right now.
[01:48:04.213 --> 01:48:05.693]  And so we are hearing back.
[01:48:05.693 --> 01:48:13.597]  We have an active duty guy right now on our blog, our site, who are saying, I am making sure I spread this as far and as fast as possible.
[01:48:13.797 --> 01:48:14.578]  We want to help them.
[01:48:14.578 --> 01:48:17.320]  We want to put billboards up outside of bases.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.841]  We want to make sure we get a care package.
[01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:23.324]  My goal is to have a care package in the hands of 40,000 active duty troops by Christmas.
[01:48:23.324 --> 01:48:24.104]  So that's my goal.
[01:48:24.104 --> 01:48:26.446]  And we're starting state networks, too.
[01:48:26.446 --> 01:48:40.076]  We now have state chapters with state directors, and our goal is to have an active Oath Keeper chapter in every county of the state to make sure the sheriff is squared away, make sure the police there know who the veterans are, they all become friends, they all know they have each other's back.
[01:48:40.076 --> 01:48:43.358]  That's our goal, is to make sure that we've got our counties squared away from the bottom up.
[01:48:44.307 --> 01:48:51.575]  Oh, and Sheriff Mack, in fact, speaking of sheriffs, has a response to Southern Poverty Law Center that he just sent me.
[01:48:51.575 --> 01:48:53.036]  We just posted it on our site.
[01:48:53.036 --> 01:48:57.160]  So, folks, when I go to Oaktreepers.org, I can read his well-reasoned response.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:04.548]  And also, Lieutenant Commander Gilley, who's an 8th Academical Commander, who was selected to write his response, will post that as soon as he sends it.
[01:49:06.087 --> 01:49:15.494]  Well good, because if we give in to this chilling effect, in fact, next Wednesday I'll announce the winners to the great Obama poster contest.
[01:49:15.494 --> 01:49:20.918]  But I'm going to go ahead and next week announce another contest to keep this going.
[01:49:20.918 --> 01:49:27.843]  Regardless, all of you that put posters up, one, be sure and follow your local laws, don't give these thugs excuses to selectively enforce on you.
[01:49:29.178 --> 01:49:38.787]  But because they're trying to threaten me, because they're telling me I don't have a First Amendment, but Obama could be in the Washington Post saying, put my posters up on stop signs.
[01:49:38.787 --> 01:49:40.909]  He's saying do something illegal, we're not.
[01:49:40.909 --> 01:49:44.813]  But they're saying we're not even allowed to legally say this.
[01:49:44.813 --> 01:49:46.314]  I'm not giving in to this intimidation.
[01:49:50.902 --> 01:49:51.462]  Well, thank you, Stuart.
[01:49:51.462 --> 01:49:52.743]  I want your take on this in a moment.
[01:49:52.743 --> 01:49:56.385]  I just wanted to tell the people, if we give in to the intimidation, they win.
[01:49:56.385 --> 01:50:00.227]  They wouldn't be going absolutely crazy over this, though, if it wasn't scaring them.
[01:50:00.227 --> 01:50:10.052]  And just the exercise of people out putting things up, just the exercise of getting off your butts, is a literal psychological and spiritual shift.
[01:50:10.052 --> 01:50:10.732]  Stuart comments.
[01:50:11.937 --> 01:50:14.938]  I mean, he's been caught lying about everything he said he'd do.
[01:50:14.938 --> 01:50:15.118]  Liar!
[01:50:15.118 --> 01:50:19.279]  But the response should be to go out there and do it more.
[01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:20.359]  That should be the response.
[01:50:42.264 --> 01:50:44.005]  Well, that's what the listeners are doing.
[01:50:44.005 --> 01:50:45.546]  I said, listeners, I said, be careful.
[01:50:45.546 --> 01:50:49.508]  And the listeners are going, no, and they're doing it to police stations.
[01:50:49.508 --> 01:50:53.490]  So the spirit of 1776 is alive and well.
[01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:58.592]  And I would caution the police military to think twice about what side of history they want to be on.
[01:50:58.592 --> 01:51:01.053]  Your gut tells you to join us.
[01:51:01.053 --> 01:51:02.754]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:51:02.754 --> 01:51:04.495]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:51:04.495 --> 01:51:11.899]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:51:12.299 --> 01:51:15.501]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:53:01.445 --> 01:53:07.470]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:13.355]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:53:13.355 --> 01:53:19.521]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:53:19.841 --> 01:53:21.823]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:53:21.823 --> 01:53:24.284]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:53:24.284 --> 01:53:37.474]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:53:37.474 --> 01:53:39.155]  It's not about left or right.
[01:53:39.155 --> 01:53:41.016]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:53:41.016 --> 01:53:47.241]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:53:56.152 --> 01:53:57.732]  The Obama Deception.
[01:53:57.732 --> 01:53:58.933]  The people strike back.
[01:54:15.118 --> 01:54:27.464]  Alright, we're going to keep Stewart five minutes in the next hour as we get to your calls.
[01:54:27.464 --> 01:54:29.465]  Let's talk to Brian in New York.
[01:54:29.465 --> 01:54:31.987]  You're on the air with fellow thought criminal.
[01:54:31.987 --> 01:54:37.950]  He dare ask the military and police to keep their oath.
[01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:38.590]  Go ahead, Brian.
[01:54:38.590 --> 01:54:39.110]  You're on the air.
[01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:41.332]  Okay.
[01:54:42.677 --> 01:54:43.778]  Brian in New York's not there.
[01:54:43.778 --> 01:54:45.880]  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:47.562]  Go ahead, Brian, you're on the air.
[01:54:47.562 --> 01:54:48.743]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:48.743 --> 01:54:49.584]  Hey.
[01:54:49.584 --> 01:54:50.184]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:54:50.184 --> 01:54:55.650]  The comment I wanted to make, actually, was regarding Obama saying to put his signs on stop signs and whatnot.
[01:54:55.650 --> 01:54:57.351]  I actually think that might be a good idea.
[01:54:57.351 --> 01:55:01.816]  Imagine if half the street corners in this country had signs that said, Stop Obama.
[01:55:03.237 --> 01:55:18.368]  Yeah, but see, you can put a sign up that shows him as God or looks like Stalin with him looking like this going... But the minute you put one up defiling his godliness, the locals just flip out.
[01:55:18.368 --> 01:55:23.692]  The government comes out and lies and says, everyone in the town hates it, it's racist, remove it.
[01:55:23.692 --> 01:55:27.756]  And that's why the elite wanted him in office, was so they could play the race card.
[01:55:28.516 --> 01:55:32.757]  Any time you disagree with him, it's just... I think it's blowing up in their face, though.
[01:55:32.757 --> 01:55:36.718]  I mean, now you can't say the word socialist?
[01:55:36.718 --> 01:55:40.519]  Let's get a comment on what Brian said from Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeeper.
[01:55:40.519 --> 01:55:41.599]  Stuart?
[01:55:41.599 --> 01:55:43.680]  Yeah, I mean, there's a tough line to walk there.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:53.162]  You want to respect the, you know, the property and the public safety of your city, but then you also want to, you know, have an active defiance.
[01:55:53.703 --> 01:56:00.232]  So I can't recommend that they go out and break the law, but let me just say you should exercise your personal rights.
[01:56:01.198 --> 01:56:02.699]  Rigorously and fully.
[01:56:02.699 --> 01:56:10.864]  Well Stuart, why do you think I'm getting sent the videos of people saying, we're just going to put them on police stations now.
[01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:23.773]  And I'm telling people, don't do it, but the spirit of 1776 is so strong, I wonder if the police know down the road, if the new order comes in, that it's not going to be street signs.
[01:56:24.565 --> 01:56:26.605]  Well, you shouldn't look at the cops as your enemy.
[01:56:26.605 --> 01:56:28.646]  I mean, this is what they want you to do.
[01:56:28.646 --> 01:56:29.946]  Yes, they want this.
[01:56:29.946 --> 01:56:32.507]  They want that, so I would recommend not doing that.
[01:56:32.507 --> 01:56:34.907]  You put that on town hall, city hall.
[01:56:34.907 --> 01:56:38.588]  You know, you put that on another oath-breaker's house or something like that.
[01:56:38.588 --> 01:56:41.929]  You don't put it on the police officer's property.
[01:56:41.929 --> 01:56:49.511]  For now, give them the benefit of the doubt that they are going to do what's right, and let them see you as their ally, not their opponent.
[01:56:49.511 --> 01:56:50.251]  No, no, I agree.
[01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:53.032]  That's why I'm saying that this needs to be done.
[01:56:54.012 --> 01:56:54.192]  Right.
[01:56:54.192 --> 01:56:55.712]  But, uh, anything else, Brian?
[01:56:55.712 --> 01:56:59.994]  I don't know, I'm just saying, just, you know, do what the, uh, President said, suggested you do.
[01:56:59.994 --> 01:57:04.415]  If he wants his name on stop signs, you know, just imagine what that message would actually say.
[01:57:04.415 --> 01:57:05.615]  Stop Obama.
[01:57:05.615 --> 01:57:13.537]  Well, what would happen if they arrest somebody putting it on a stop sign, or maybe below the sign so it doesn't endanger public safety, and then you get a ticket or arrested?
[01:57:13.537 --> 01:57:18.578]  You can go in with an official letterhead of the President telling his constituents to do it.
[01:57:18.578 --> 01:57:22.179]  Is the court then gonna go after Obama?
[01:57:22.179 --> 01:57:22.519]  Uh, no.
[01:57:25.643 --> 01:57:26.704]  Go ahead.
[01:57:26.704 --> 01:57:34.371]  I know, it's not going to stop the course, but it's going to stop, you know, it'll probably say, hey, listen, Obama said to do this, so I'm just following the President's orders.
[01:57:34.371 --> 01:57:36.113]  All right, let's talk to John in Missouri.
[01:57:36.113 --> 01:57:37.554]  John in Missouri, make it quick, please, sir.
[01:57:37.554 --> 01:57:39.035]  Go ahead.
[01:57:39.035 --> 01:57:42.899]  Stuart, Alex, it's great to talk to two great American patriots.
[01:57:42.899 --> 01:57:44.300]  Keep up the good work, keep pressing on.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:47.924]  I got one point to make to all patriots out there.
[01:57:47.924 --> 01:57:50.186]  If they do press this issue and push the button,
[01:57:51.158 --> 01:58:00.243]  That all patriots need to know who the enemy is so they can be singled out in the future so they can do their job.
[01:58:00.243 --> 01:58:02.785]  Know who the people in the CFR are.
[01:58:02.785 --> 01:58:19.114]  Know who the people in the high command that have been acting treasonously against our country so that when you get the opportunity for making a citizen's arrest or a somewhat different approach, they can know what their true enemy is.
[01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:28.992]  Well, they wanted to attack Iran, but Fox Fallon said no, so there are even some good people at the higher levels.
[01:58:28.992 --> 01:58:31.752]  We'll get Stewart Rhodes' takes on that when we get back.
[01:58:31.752 --> 01:58:32.253]  Thank you, John.
[01:58:32.253 --> 01:58:35.553]  We'll talk to Ryan, Dee, and Jeff, and others.
[01:58:35.553 --> 01:58:42.355]  Bob Chapman's coming up on the economy as well.
[01:58:42.355 --> 01:58:46.075]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.075 --> 01:58:48.196]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.674 --> 01:58:54.895]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.895 --> 01:58:56.915]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.915 --> 01:59:05.437]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.437 --> 01:59:10.979]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.979 --> 01:59:12.599]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.839 --> 01:59:19.363]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.363 --> 01:59:30.409]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.409 --> 01:59:30.869]  That's right.
[01:59:31.169 --> 01:59:33.731]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.731 --> 01:59:37.895]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:37.895 --> 01:59:41.077]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[01:59:53.667 --> 01:59:56.049]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.049 --> 01:59:58.852]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.461 --> 02:00:10.307]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.307 --> 02:00:11.868]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.868 --> 02:00:13.450]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.450 --> 02:00:17.635]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.635 --> 02:00:21.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.569 --> 02:00:30.755]  Stuart Rhodes isn't that big issue, what the last caller was bringing up, that the establishment's playing a very dangerous game.
[02:00:30.755 --> 02:00:39.282]  They want to stir up resistance, but only enough to label it kooky and then demonize peaceful demonstrating, peaceful voting.
[02:00:40.438 --> 02:00:42.860]  Peaceful litigation.
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:49.887]  They want enough of a revolt to crack down, but not a big enough revolt where it's seen as widespread and then they lose.
[02:00:49.887 --> 02:00:55.873]  So I don't want to give them the revolt, the violent revolt, but I don't know if the establishment knows.
[02:00:55.873 --> 02:00:57.455]  I think they do to a certain extent.
[02:00:57.455 --> 02:01:04.601]  There really are probably about a million people that really don't want to live anymore and just want to go after globalists.
[02:01:07.372 --> 02:01:22.221]  You see the White House now apologizing, all these senators apologizing, saying, okay, we know you're mainstream, we know a lot of you are Democrats that don't want the health care and don't want the cap-and-trade, okay, we're sorry, yes, and so there's a total capitulation happening.
[02:01:22.221 --> 02:01:27.745]  I think this may have been them breaking and deciding to not go with a very hot summer and fall.
[02:01:27.745 --> 02:01:34.749]  I'm not saying that's happened, but I think they're starting to realize this is not going to be as easy as what they did to the Russian people.
[02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:38.952]  Well, no, because we're not Russian peasants, we're not Chinese peasants, we're Cambodian.
[02:01:38.952 --> 02:01:40.172]  This is America.
[02:01:40.172 --> 02:01:44.234]  We have a long history of fighting back against any kind of tyrant.
[02:01:44.234 --> 02:01:46.495]  And so, you know, they've got their work cut out for them.
[02:01:46.495 --> 02:01:51.258]  But they're still trying the same playbook, which is demonize, marginalize, and chill speech.
[02:01:51.258 --> 02:01:55.180]  They're threatening you with arrest because they want you to stop speaking out.
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:56.621]  And that's the motive of that brand.
[02:01:56.621 --> 02:02:00.263]  I get emails all the time saying, I'm afraid to join those keepers, I don't want to be on a list.
[02:02:01.403 --> 02:02:07.187]  So all this DHS stuff and all the rest of the Bobby Locke Center, it does work on some people because it shows their speech.
[02:02:31.803 --> 02:02:32.364]  That's right.
[02:02:32.364 --> 02:02:33.765]  That's why I said I wasn't agreeing.
[02:02:33.765 --> 02:02:36.667]  The answer is they have 300 names on that list.
[02:02:36.667 --> 02:02:38.188]  Put us all on the list.
[02:02:38.188 --> 02:02:39.530]  And that is the proper response.
[02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:41.431]  And that's what I think is going to happen.
[02:02:41.431 --> 02:02:43.693]  So, folks, don't let them steal your speech.
[02:02:43.693 --> 02:02:53.841]  Because if you think you're going to be able to just be quietly the gray man in the bowl and sit back and not make waves and you're going to be okay, you're kidding yourself.
[02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:55.202]  Go look back at history.
[02:02:55.202 --> 02:02:56.883]  Look at the gulags in Russia.
[02:02:56.883 --> 02:03:00.366]  Half the guys in the gulags are riding Stalin, saying, I can understand why I'm here.
[02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:01.627]  There was some mistake.
[02:03:01.627 --> 02:03:03.068]  There was no mistake.
[02:03:03.068 --> 02:03:04.609]  You're there for a damn good reason.
[02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:06.851]  Don't think being quiet is going to keep you safe.
[02:03:06.851 --> 02:03:09.533]  You need to step out in the street right now and speak up.
[02:03:09.533 --> 02:03:12.396]  Use your First Amendment before you have to use a second.
[02:03:12.396 --> 02:03:12.936]  Exactly.
[02:03:12.936 --> 02:03:16.799]  The only way to beat these people is to stand up to the bullies.
[02:03:16.799 --> 02:03:21.943]  And that's what Alexander Shultz and Edson said, to paraphrase, oh how we burned in the camps.
[02:03:21.943 --> 02:03:28.088]  That when Stalin would send out his secret police arresting people every night, that we didn't wait for him with our daggers and our hatchets.
[02:03:28.989 --> 02:03:36.117]  And literally, folks, you cross over to a point spiritually, mentally, historically, that you're part of a species.
[02:03:36.117 --> 02:03:40.181]  And liberty and freedom for the human condition is what matters.
[02:03:40.181 --> 02:03:44.866]  And not letting control freaks and criminals and backstabbers and parasites run things.
[02:03:45.587 --> 02:03:47.868]  And I look at it this way, politically.
[02:03:47.868 --> 02:03:49.790]  Not physically, but if need be.
[02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:50.790]  The Alamo.
[02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:52.331]  You know, Travis knew he was going to die.
[02:03:52.331 --> 02:03:53.552]  He said victory in death.
[02:03:53.552 --> 02:03:54.792]  He felt good about it.
[02:03:54.792 --> 02:03:56.814]  And it wasn't that he was some madman.
[02:03:56.814 --> 02:03:59.976]  This was the chance of a lifetime to stand up to a bunch of thugs.
[02:03:59.976 --> 02:04:03.838]  And he knew that his blood was going to water the tree of liberty.
[02:04:04.358 --> 02:04:06.600]  And so I don't know what people are afraid of out there.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:13.325]  This is the real chance to actually fight for the Republic when it's really under attack, when they're coming for your family.
[02:04:13.325 --> 02:04:15.086]  Stewart, closing comment in the last 45 seconds.
[02:04:16.618 --> 02:04:17.819]  Hey, well I'm going to die anyway.
[02:04:17.819 --> 02:04:20.282]  And like I said, use your voice first.
[02:04:20.282 --> 02:04:21.383]  But hey, I'm not afraid to die.
[02:04:21.383 --> 02:04:22.184]  I'm going to die anyway.
[02:04:22.184 --> 02:04:23.806]  None of us gets out of here alive.
[02:04:23.806 --> 02:04:25.708]  And what counts is that our children are free.
[02:04:25.708 --> 02:04:27.049]  That's all that counts.
[02:04:27.049 --> 02:04:28.431]  So it's time to voice.
[02:04:28.431 --> 02:04:29.732]  Use your voice.
[02:04:29.732 --> 02:04:31.574]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[02:04:31.574 --> 02:04:32.575]  Use your pen.
[02:04:32.575 --> 02:04:33.636]  And speak out.
[02:04:33.636 --> 02:04:35.298]  And join Oath Keepers at OathKeepers.org.
[02:04:36.454 --> 02:04:40.382]  Alright, Stuart, as that fundraiser comes up, we're going to get behind you and our great listeners.
[02:04:40.382 --> 02:04:42.265]  That's what is important.
[02:04:42.265 --> 02:04:44.229]  I'm just the gateway to these great people.
[02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:45.211]  He's going to support you.
[02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:45.772]  God bless you.
[02:04:45.772 --> 02:04:47.014]  We'll talk to you as that approaches.
[02:04:48.473 --> 02:04:48.853]  Thank you.
[02:04:48.853 --> 02:04:50.374]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[02:04:50.374 --> 02:04:52.015]  Bob Chapman as well.
[02:04:52.015 --> 02:04:53.477]  A ton of news.
[02:04:53.477 --> 02:04:56.559]  We are now entering the second American revolution.
[02:04:56.559 --> 02:05:00.622]  Gerald Salente has now written an editorial concurring with my analysis.
[02:05:00.622 --> 02:05:05.945]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:05.945 --> 02:05:08.027]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:05:08.027 --> 02:05:10.468]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:10.468 --> 02:05:12.750]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:14.371]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:14.371 --> 02:05:15.412]  There is a solution.
[02:05:15.632 --> 02:05:24.054]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:05:24.054 --> 02:05:31.516]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:05:37.558 --> 02:05:43.119]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:05:43.559 --> 02:05:47.702]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:06:00.831 --> 02:06:06.035]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:06.035 --> 02:06:10.058]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:10.058 --> 02:06:15.962]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.962 --> 02:06:21.025]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.025 --> 02:06:21.486]  Number three,
[02:06:21.946 --> 02:06:28.230]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:31.132]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:06:31.132 --> 02:06:35.655]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:35.655 --> 02:06:39.257]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.497 --> 02:06:45.243]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:06:45.243 --> 02:06:49.928]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.928 --> 02:06:51.710]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:54.273]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:56.915]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.399 --> 02:07:01.780]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.780]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:04.761]  Well, you should.
[02:07:04.761 --> 02:07:09.243]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:07:09.243 --> 02:07:10.063]  That's right.
[02:07:10.063 --> 02:07:18.707]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:07:18.707 --> 02:07:20.067]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:07:20.067 --> 02:07:21.208]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:07:21.428 --> 02:07:27.392]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:07:27.392 --> 02:07:34.296]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:07:34.296 --> 02:07:39.820]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:41.281]  This is real.
[02:07:41.281 --> 02:07:42.341]  Don't miss out.
[02:07:42.341 --> 02:07:49.206]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit or pennies on the dollar.
[02:07:49.446 --> 02:07:50.886]  And get your free handgun.
[02:07:50.886 --> 02:07:53.247]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:07:53.247 --> 02:07:56.948]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:07:56.948 --> 02:08:00.889]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:08:00.889 --> 02:08:06.310]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:13.191]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.191 --> 02:08:16.332]  Dee in Arizona, Jeff in Ohio, Inger in Florida.
[02:08:17.931 --> 02:08:22.314]  John in Ohio, Dave in Florida, and many others are called for coming up.
[02:08:22.314 --> 02:08:26.096]  Wide open phones for the next hour with Bob Chapman.
[02:08:26.096 --> 02:08:30.699]  I'm going to recap some of the top stories, get into some of the other news I haven't covered yet.
[02:08:30.699 --> 02:08:32.040]  Bob, there's so much to talk about.
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:36.763]  For those that don't know, Bob Chapman, of course, was in military intelligence during the Cold War in Berlin.
[02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:43.327]  Then he became one of the most successful silver and gold traders out there.
[02:08:43.327 --> 02:08:50.191]  He also helped publish some of the original Patriot publications like Gary Allen's Don't Dare Call a Conspiracy that woke me up.
[02:08:50.191 --> 02:08:52.793]  Really, there's one founding thing that really put it all together.
[02:08:52.793 --> 02:08:54.514]  I had the info.
[02:08:54.514 --> 02:08:55.754]  Kind of the term born awake.
[02:08:55.754 --> 02:08:59.397]  I mean, I just grew up knowing history, knowing the truth, learning it as I went.
[02:08:59.397 --> 02:09:02.438]  But that film really crystallized things when I was about 14 or 15 and read it.
[02:09:04.278 --> 02:09:10.145]  He was involved publishing that, worked with so many other people, and of course has one of the biggest newsletters out there, The International Forecaster.
[02:09:10.145 --> 02:09:12.207]  www.TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:09:12.207 --> 02:09:13.889]  Our website is www.InfoWars.com.
[02:09:13.889 --> 02:09:16.292]  But I want to move through just quick topics with you.
[02:09:16.292 --> 02:09:18.054]  Let's cover the economy first.
[02:09:19.465 --> 02:09:33.058]  They keep saying it's the end of the recession, everything's fine, 558,000 people lost their job in the last month, the job losses are accelerating, the restaurants are closing, the factories, the industries.
[02:09:33.058 --> 02:09:40.544]  I wish things were getting better, but all the real indicators of Main Street, unless I'm wrong, Bob, show an implosion, but then they are taking their 27, their 23.7,
[02:09:43.919 --> 02:09:45.159]  And that's a month-old number.
[02:09:45.159 --> 02:09:47.940]  We'll get new numbers in the next month.
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:51.321]  $23.7 trillion, almost double the GDP stolen in 10 months.
[02:09:51.321 --> 02:09:56.823]  They are pumping it in, but they admit that's mainly institutional buyers of those stocks and bonds.
[02:09:56.823 --> 02:09:58.103]  They're buying up infrastructure.
[02:09:58.103 --> 02:09:59.884]  The banks aren't lending.
[02:09:59.884 --> 02:10:02.165]  The Federal Reserve's paying to not lend.
[02:10:02.165 --> 02:10:03.405]  The dollar's going down.
[02:10:03.405 --> 02:10:04.585]  Gold's going up.
[02:10:04.585 --> 02:10:08.266]  Are we going to see another run-up in commodities like we saw a year and a half ago?
[02:10:08.266 --> 02:10:12.988]  Bob Chapman, are these green shoots, or what's really happening?
[02:10:14.127 --> 02:10:17.768]  You could poison ivy.
[02:10:17.768 --> 02:10:18.908]  How's that for an opener?
[02:10:18.908 --> 02:10:20.969]  He led right into it.
[02:10:20.969 --> 02:10:23.389]  I thank you very much.
[02:10:23.389 --> 02:10:39.933]  But listen, if everything was so hunky-dory, why have three top officials and top people, we'll say, in economics come out and said, I think we might need another stimulus here, like I projected last January.
[02:10:39.933 --> 02:10:41.473]  I talked in terms of two trillion.
[02:10:42.150 --> 02:10:48.752]  I know even Joe Stiglitz has come out, and he's at Harvard, and he's an eminent World Bank economist.
[02:10:48.752 --> 02:10:50.673]  And he says, yeah, we need one of these.
[02:10:50.673 --> 02:10:53.113]  We've got to give Keynesianism a chance.
[02:10:53.113 --> 02:11:01.916]  What he's saying is, I don't think the first go-around was allocated properly in the right places at the right time.
[02:11:01.916 --> 02:11:07.218]  The people who got the checks, they went out and paid all their bills with them instead of spending them.
[02:11:07.218 --> 02:11:11.379]  They got a lot of what's involved in the stimulus package is a lot of tax breaks.
[02:11:11.829 --> 02:11:14.630]  It takes too long for them to come down the pike.
[02:11:14.630 --> 02:11:18.630]  And so, he's talking in terms like others are in the administration.
[02:11:18.630 --> 02:11:20.010]  They're getting the ball rolling.
[02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:25.051]  By the end of the year, they'll be looking for that $2 trillion so that this thing doesn't go under.
[02:11:25.051 --> 02:11:37.554]  But I think the big story here that nobody has talked about, and that's usually the case when I start spouting off about what's going on, there's something hidden here that people don't understand.
[02:11:37.554 --> 02:11:39.934]  And I'll make it as simple as possible.
[02:11:41.698 --> 02:11:49.083]  It was recently that the Federal Reserve, again, created $500 billion out of nothing.
[02:11:49.083 --> 02:11:59.509]  They lent that, or exchanged that, with five other major central banks and received currencies for that.
[02:11:59.509 --> 02:12:02.531]  And they received dollars.
[02:12:02.531 --> 02:12:09.735]  They used those currencies to go into the foreign exchange market to push while they sell those foreign currencies
[02:12:10.213 --> 02:12:13.815]  They push those currencies down so that the dollar will go up.
[02:12:13.815 --> 02:12:15.796]  That's what that's for.
[02:12:15.796 --> 02:12:19.117]  But they're doing something else.
[02:12:19.117 --> 02:12:29.182]  They are having those central banks take those dollars that they have and go into the Treasury auction market and buy U.S.
[02:12:29.182 --> 02:12:32.584]  Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.
[02:12:32.584 --> 02:12:37.106]  So that's monetizing the debt, but they're doing it by laundering it through foreign banks.
[02:12:38.015 --> 02:12:39.015]  Exactly.
[02:12:39.015 --> 02:12:42.056]  Now, let me give you some statistics.
[02:12:42.056 --> 02:12:43.336]  I'm writing a piece on China.
[02:12:43.336 --> 02:12:47.777]  I don't know whether it'll get published this weekend, probably on Wednesday.
[02:12:47.777 --> 02:13:00.139]  And the Chinese, it looks like they've sold off about $600 billion with a dollar denominated assets, taking their dollar denominated assets down to $1.1 trillion.
[02:13:00.139 --> 02:13:01.520]  Now, they have not
[02:13:08.362 --> 02:13:10.424]  We've been buying treasuries.
[02:13:10.424 --> 02:13:16.609]  And so, there's an absence of buying of $500 billion to a trillion dollars.
[02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:19.371]  So, we'll say $700 billion.
[02:13:19.371 --> 02:13:25.116]  So, if you take it both ways, you've got a sale of $600 billion and a non-buy of $700 billion.
[02:13:25.116 --> 02:13:31.802]  That's one point, one point, uh, I lost my train of thought there.
[02:13:31.802 --> 02:13:32.602]  It's, um, $500 billion.
[02:13:37.572 --> 02:13:44.997]  And $700, as $1.3 trillion that was either sold or didn't participate.
[02:13:44.997 --> 02:13:48.579]  And somebody's got to come up with that money.
[02:13:48.579 --> 02:13:50.801]  Foreign central banks of some kind.
[02:13:50.801 --> 02:13:51.822]  And they're not coming up with it.
[02:13:51.822 --> 02:13:53.923]  They're buying, but they're not buying enough.
[02:13:53.923 --> 02:14:03.149]  So the difference is they're not buying, the Fed's buying, and they're creating the money to do so through the foreign central banks, and they're trying to befuddle everybody.
[02:14:03.149 --> 02:14:06.171]  And when foreigners find out what they're doing,
[02:14:07.299 --> 02:14:21.672]  Secretly, they're going to freak out because they're holding 64.5% of the forex exchange that they have, foreign exchange that they have, in dollars.
[02:14:21.672 --> 02:14:24.294]  So if the dollar goes down because of what the Fed's doing,
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:28.182]  Behind the scenes, they're going to be very unhappy about that.
[02:14:28.182 --> 02:14:46.996]  But, the Fed is also, let me just interrupt here, the Fed is also, as you said, and this has been confirmed, it's also devaluing their currency so everybody's sinking so that it's not as noticeable and then all of the assets are going to the elites.
[02:14:46.996 --> 02:14:48.297]  That's correct.
[02:14:48.297 --> 02:14:53.921]  And, you know, the Chinese could be out of the dollar in a year.
[02:14:54.722 --> 02:14:56.583]  Maybe a year and a half.
[02:14:56.583 --> 02:14:57.903]  Dependent.
[02:14:57.903 --> 02:15:04.205]  And that's why, that's a big reason why the dollar is going to get out and test 71.18.
[02:15:04.205 --> 02:15:07.365]  It's now around 78 and a half or so.
[02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:14.347]  And I think when it tests, it may well break through to the downside.
[02:15:14.347 --> 02:15:20.929]  And the reason I say that is all these other nations who have been holding on, they're going to say, hey, we've been taken.
[02:15:21.801 --> 02:15:23.843]  Now, how long that's going to take, I don't know.
[02:15:23.843 --> 02:15:27.145]  It could take six months, it could take two and a half years.
[02:15:27.145 --> 02:15:28.987]  I don't know.
[02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:43.698]  We don't know what the reaction of these governments is going to be, because don't forget that when they don't do what Washington tells them, and they're very strong about, we don't want to do that, Washington tells them, do you want your country invaded?
[02:15:43.698 --> 02:15:48.802]  I mean, do you want your internet and banking services cut off?
[02:15:49.392 --> 02:15:53.095]  Do you want your postal from the United States cut off?
[02:15:53.095 --> 02:15:55.117]  Your planes can't land in our country?
[02:15:55.117 --> 02:15:57.679]  And this is true, they do this.
[02:15:57.679 --> 02:16:04.544]  Because I've been told by ex-heads of state that they actually do this.
[02:16:04.544 --> 02:16:07.406]  So, this is where this is all leading.
[02:16:07.406 --> 02:16:10.729]  And the dollar going down is a lead pipe search.
[02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.911]  You know, the question is how bad it'll be.
[02:16:13.271 --> 02:16:14.732]  Well, Bob, that's what the world government is.
[02:16:14.732 --> 02:16:25.781]  They brag this new bank of the world won't just buy fiat or intimidation or arm twisting or claiming you're a terrorist state and putting embargoes on you or sanctions.
[02:16:25.781 --> 02:16:30.405]  They are going to openly have the power to manipulate all the currencies and manipulate
[02:16:30.845 --> 02:16:31.445]  How is it going for them?
[02:16:31.445 --> 02:16:33.946]  Are things going well in your expert opinion?
[02:17:00.154 --> 02:17:07.477]  I think they're not going well for them, and that was pointed out in Greece at the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:17:07.477 --> 02:17:12.799]  And what they're trying to do, I think, is pull this thing back and stop it.
[02:17:12.799 --> 02:17:22.382]  And I think it's way beyond their ability to stop this destruction, economically and financially, of not only the United States, but the world.
[02:17:22.382 --> 02:17:26.543]  And I really think that that's what they're trying to do, and that's what I think they agreed on.
[02:17:26.543 --> 02:17:27.784]  And I don't think it's impossible.
[02:17:29.233 --> 02:17:31.796]  It would be good, actually, if it was possible.
[02:17:31.796 --> 02:17:41.407]  But, you know, June of 2002 was the date when you had flown too far and you couldn't go back.
[02:17:41.407 --> 02:17:43.709]  The point of no return.
[02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:45.531]  And they're gonna have to live with it.
[02:17:45.531 --> 02:17:47.954]  And if it doesn't work out for them,
[02:17:49.988 --> 02:17:53.950]  What's going to happen is the public is going to say, alright, who did this to us?
[02:17:53.950 --> 02:18:01.513]  They're going to line them up in court, and they're going to put them in jail, and they're going to take their wealth away from them, if they're lucky.
[02:18:01.513 --> 02:18:06.896]  If we have a repeat of the French Revolution, I don't think it's going to be very nice.
[02:18:07.591 --> 02:18:21.578]  But Bob, the problem is the establishment, and I'm sure of it now with the Southern Poverty Law Center's declaration demonizing any gun owners or anybody that doesn't want world government, the feds are going to stage terror attacks against themselves.
[02:18:21.578 --> 02:18:24.300]  We even have congressmen coming out saying they're going to stage something.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:26.921]  They may use flu for martial law.
[02:18:26.921 --> 02:18:30.203]  Congressman Brown is in the Louisville Journal.
[02:18:30.203 --> 02:18:32.544]  This is all very clear.
[02:18:32.544 --> 02:18:33.485]  Their only move
[02:18:34.125 --> 02:18:42.903]  is to play the victim and they always do that with a Reichstag event and I agree that people are so angry and so awake that that's probably gonna blow up.
[02:18:44.037 --> 02:18:50.244]  And, but I don't see the hubris-filled establishment backing off.
[02:18:50.244 --> 02:18:53.867]  So, I see this playing out with a lot of fireworks.
[02:18:53.867 --> 02:19:05.239]  And I agree with you, the evidence of Geithner chewing the carpet, blowing up, screaming at Bernanke, other evidence coming out, shows that all is not well in Camelot, and that
[02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:09.932]  The pit they dug for us is going to enfold them.
[02:19:09.932 --> 02:19:25.340]  And lastly, it's clear, and now they're even starting to admit this, that they're creating a depression on Main Street as they pump out all these fiat dollars to pay off their derivatives debts, and that they're paying banks not to loan, because if the banks did loan, we'd have inflation.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:34.804]  So instead, you literally have the elite being able to buy everything up, we pay the interest on giving them the money, and then we get to live in a depression.
[02:19:34.804 --> 02:19:36.244]  So I want your take on that when we get back.
[02:19:36.244 --> 02:19:40.606]  And we're going to phone calls at 1-800-259-99231.
[02:19:40.606 --> 02:19:44.807]  Pentagon wants authority to post 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[02:19:44.807 --> 02:19:47.228]  This is official, congressional report.
[02:19:47.228 --> 02:19:47.428]  I mean...
[02:19:49.209 --> 02:19:54.572]  That's just off the chart and that the troops are training for martial law drills, mainstream news.
[02:19:54.572 --> 02:19:56.293]  We're going to go over that too.
[02:19:56.293 --> 02:19:58.854]  Big hour and 40 minutes left.
[02:19:58.854 --> 02:20:01.455]  Stay with us.

[02:21:07.664 --> 02:21:13.566]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:21:13.566 --> 02:21:19.709]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.049 --> 02:21:22.010]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:24.491]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:24.491 --> 02:21:37.677]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:21:37.677 --> 02:21:39.338]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.338 --> 02:21:41.199]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.199 --> 02:21:47.442]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:24:01.997 --> 02:24:04.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:21.435]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:21.435 --> 02:24:27.541]  Bob, I catch myself pinching myself like I'm in a dream.
[02:24:29.465 --> 02:24:36.330]  To have mainstream news reporting they're doing martial law drills, how to lock down cities, how to forcibly inoculate people.
[02:24:36.330 --> 02:24:41.333]  The Pentagon now wants 400,000 to deal with emergencies, terrorism, and insurrection.
[02:24:41.333 --> 02:24:47.017]  I mean, there's no doubt they're going to completely turn into a total Red Dawn armed camp with checkpoints.
[02:24:47.017 --> 02:24:48.738]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[02:24:48.738 --> 02:24:50.500]  The government is totally rogue and criminal.
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:52.001]  It doesn't matter what administration.
[02:24:53.416 --> 02:25:06.860]  But Governor's Association, according to the Hill newspaper, have sent a letter to them saying this is a takeover, we're concerned, your federal power grab, you know, the Pentagon doing this.
[02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:22.184]  We've got Congressman Brown telling the Louisville newspaper that they may want to use, and that quote, the elite want to use, the flu pandemic, they may stage it as a pretext for martial law.
[02:25:22.184 --> 02:25:22.424]  I mean,
[02:25:23.846 --> 02:25:29.908]  Bob Chapman, it's... The stuff we were talking about years ago is now becoming mainstream.
[02:25:29.908 --> 02:25:39.051]  I'd say our movement is 50 times bigger, conservatively, than it was in the mid-1990s when the feds bombed themselves to play the part of victims.
[02:25:39.051 --> 02:25:45.793]  I don't see an Oklahoma City or something, or even a staged mass shooting they staged to blame us.
[02:25:45.793 --> 02:25:47.154]  I don't see that working.
[02:25:47.154 --> 02:25:50.415]  We've done our job exposing the globalists.
[02:25:50.415 --> 02:25:52.636]  I mean, we've still got a long way to go here, but I think
[02:25:53.536 --> 02:25:59.561]  We have irrevocably damaged the New World Order.
[02:25:59.561 --> 02:26:00.622]  And I agree.
[02:26:00.622 --> 02:26:04.244]  And we've talked about this in the past several weeks.
[02:26:04.244 --> 02:26:12.470]  And the internet and the broadcasting that we've been able to get out has forced their hand.
[02:26:12.470 --> 02:26:20.056]  And they're going to have to try to go for it here because what they're doing financially and economically is blowing up on them.
[02:26:20.056 --> 02:26:22.258]  I figure that by the Chinese
[02:26:23.414 --> 02:26:25.155]  Selling U.S.
[02:26:25.155 --> 02:26:29.018]  dollar-denominated assets and not buying U.S.
[02:26:29.018 --> 02:26:50.315]  denominated assets has had to have made the Fed, secretly, this year, purchase somewhere between $500 billion and $800 billion worth of Treasury and GSE paper, which is Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie, and that's what they're up to.
[02:26:50.725 --> 02:26:55.370]  Well no, they admitted to Congress they've bought it, but they wouldn't say how much.
[02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:59.054]  No, that was another program that was announced.
[02:26:59.054 --> 02:27:02.078]  That program there, this is beside that program.
[02:27:02.078 --> 02:27:02.238]  Oh!
[02:27:02.238 --> 02:27:07.184]  That program there was $300 billion in Treasuries, $600 billion in GSEs, and $1.2 trillion in CDOs.
[02:27:12.864 --> 02:27:18.788]  Yeah, and then I saw Bernanke at a town hall meeting say he's not monetizing.
[02:27:18.788 --> 02:27:25.533]  I mean, that's like him coming on TV and saying dollars aren't green.
[02:27:25.533 --> 02:27:26.694]  They all lie.
[02:27:26.694 --> 02:27:34.379]  It's part of the sociopathic and psychopathic mind trail of what we're dealing with here.
[02:27:34.379 --> 02:27:38.482]  I mean, we're dealing with a bunch of Caligulas, hundreds of them.
[02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:40.804]  I mean, these people are really insane.
[02:27:43.396 --> 02:27:49.301]  What do you think about the fact that they first demonized three weeks ago, and I told you it was going to be big news, folks.
[02:27:49.301 --> 02:27:52.643]  I can see these trends.
[02:27:52.643 --> 02:27:55.405]  And I make that point so people pay attention to what we're saying here.
[02:27:55.405 --> 02:27:57.327]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:27:57.327 --> 02:27:58.688]  First they said it was all fake.
[02:27:58.688 --> 02:28:01.830]  Now they've had to apologize and say, okay, it wasn't fake.
[02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:04.412]  So see how they arrogantly tried to say it was fake?
[02:28:04.412 --> 02:28:08.435]  And I said two weeks ago, Bob said two weeks ago, that was going to blow up only bigger.
[02:28:08.435 --> 02:28:12.058]  Now they've done the smart thing and apologized, but too little too late, Bob.
[02:28:14.042 --> 02:28:17.004]  Yeah, we just got to continue the steamroller.
[02:28:17.004 --> 02:28:30.611]  People have got to continue to be outspoken like you, sir, at the town hall meetings, like at the tea parties, the promulgation of a movement by Ron Paul.
[02:28:30.611 --> 02:28:32.812]  It's got to get bigger and better.
[02:28:32.812 --> 02:28:34.173]  We have to drive them crazy.
[02:28:34.173 --> 02:28:36.514]  We have to get in their face.
[02:28:36.514 --> 02:28:41.537]  And if we don't do that, we may end up fighting in the streets.
[02:28:41.537 --> 02:28:42.758]  And so we've got to do it.
[02:28:43.274 --> 02:28:46.656]  We've got to show them that we're not going to back down.
[02:28:46.656 --> 02:28:49.718]  We've got to show them how powerful we can be.
[02:28:49.718 --> 02:28:54.320]  And we have to tell the military, you are our guys.
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:56.662]  We want to be with you.
[02:28:56.662 --> 02:29:00.004]  We don't want to be against you.
[02:29:00.004 --> 02:29:01.685]  And so, get it together.
[02:29:01.685 --> 02:29:05.887]  The government is giving you unlawful orders.
[02:29:05.887 --> 02:29:07.368]  And that's exactly what that is.
[02:29:07.368 --> 02:29:10.210]  It's a violation of posse capitatis.
[02:29:10.210 --> 02:29:10.810]  And they know it.
[02:29:12.113 --> 02:29:16.881]  The military people know it.
[02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:18.043]  Well, they certainly do.
[02:29:18.043 --> 02:29:24.374]  I mean, a year and a half ago, 70 plus percent of the campaign donations were to Ron Paul from the military.
[02:29:25.339 --> 02:29:28.940]  But I guess that's why they're trying to get rid of all the citizens and hire felons and illegal aliens.
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:31.481]  All right, we're gonna go right to your phone calls.
[02:29:31.481 --> 02:29:35.542]  D-Jeff, Inger, John, Dave, and others.
[02:29:35.542 --> 02:29:36.503]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:36.503 --> 02:29:38.764]  Add your question and comment.
[02:29:38.764 --> 02:29:39.364]  Ready?
[02:29:39.364 --> 02:29:41.985]  We'll go right to you on the other side of this break.
[02:29:41.985 --> 02:29:51.648]  And then we're scheduled to have Ambassador Alan Keyes on on a host of issues in the final hour today.
[02:29:51.648 --> 02:29:53.048]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.048 --> 02:29:54.549]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.567 --> 02:30:01.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.468 --> 02:30:04.489]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.489 --> 02:30:09.830]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:11.871]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.871 --> 02:30:16.872]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.872 --> 02:30:17.792]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.052 --> 02:30:19.173]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.173 --> 02:30:21.055]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.055 --> 02:30:22.135]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.135 --> 02:30:24.337]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.337 --> 02:30:25.678]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.678 --> 02:30:27.200]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:32.484]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.484 --> 02:30:36.067]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.067 --> 02:30:39.530]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:41.091]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.091 --> 02:30:41.992]  We don't know.
[02:30:41.992 --> 02:30:43.113]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.113 --> 02:30:44.034]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.034 --> 02:30:45.135]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.135 --> 02:30:48.178]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:48.178 --> 02:30:49.960]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:50.860]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.427 --> 02:31:05.754]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.754 --> 02:31:07.817]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:07.817 --> 02:31:10.280]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:12.543]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.543 --> 02:31:14.185]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.185 --> 02:31:15.207]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.427 --> 02:31:23.849]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:31:23.849 --> 02:31:31.311]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:31:31.311 --> 02:31:36.973]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:31:37.353 --> 02:31:43.358]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:31:43.358 --> 02:31:47.521]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:31:47.521 --> 02:31:54.986]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:31:54.986 --> 02:31:58.309]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:32:00.384 --> 02:32:04.628]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:32:04.628 --> 02:32:06.630]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:15.159]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:20.704]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:32:20.704 --> 02:32:22.326]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:32:22.566 --> 02:32:29.071]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:32:29.071 --> 02:32:40.119]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:32:40.119 --> 02:32:40.599]  That's right.
[02:32:40.879 --> 02:32:43.440]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:45.261]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:45.261 --> 02:32:45.521]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:45.521 --> 02:32:48.102]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:32:48.102 --> 02:32:48.682]  That's acolablue.com.
[02:33:08.818 --> 02:33:09.198]  I think?
[02:33:32.961 --> 02:33:40.384]  We are going to your phone calls and a host of other news items here in just a minute or two.
[02:33:40.384 --> 02:33:53.130]  I wanted to first tell all the radio listeners and PrisonPlanet.TV viewers watching us right now, as we simulcast the radio show as a television show, that we have all the Obama shirts in.
[02:33:53.130 --> 02:33:56.472]  Eight different varieties of Obama with the iconic
[02:33:58.425 --> 02:34:04.850]  Joker paint as the psychopathic criminal that he is for the New World Order, lying about everything.
[02:34:04.850 --> 02:34:07.092]  Everything he says is a complete lie.
[02:34:07.092 --> 02:34:09.154]  Even worse than Bush when it comes to lying.
[02:34:09.154 --> 02:34:12.917]  Bush actually did a few of the things he said he would do.
[02:34:12.917 --> 02:34:16.840]  It was just what he was doing was unconstitutional.
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:18.862]  These are all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:18.862 --> 02:34:22.045]  You can also print off the free flyers.
[02:34:22.045 --> 02:34:25.147]  And I would suggest you put them in legal, lawful places.
[02:34:26.018 --> 02:34:31.760]  That's wherever you see a bunch of other posters an inch thick in your city center or wherever.
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:34.621]  If they come after you for that, that's selective enforcement.
[02:34:34.621 --> 02:34:35.961]  They're thugs.
[02:34:35.961 --> 02:34:38.682]  And they're trying to intimidate everybody and say you better not do it.
[02:34:38.682 --> 02:34:42.404]  That's because they're scared of it.
[02:34:42.404 --> 02:34:50.586]  Meanwhile, the President tells his supporters, the Washington Post, we have that linked up on InfoWars.com, to go out and put his image everywhere.
[02:34:50.586 --> 02:34:55.328]  The iconic Hope image, where he's like mousy tongue or linen.
[02:34:56.730 --> 02:35:01.494]  Looking off into the distance thinking about the property he's going to steal from people.
[02:35:01.494 --> 02:35:04.916]  So that is available again at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:04.916 --> 02:35:07.238]  You can get the t-shirts or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:35:07.238 --> 02:35:08.819]  We also have films like the Obama
[02:35:16.107 --> 02:35:22.538]  Deception available in-game, Terror Storm, all the other great books and videos we carry at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:22.538 --> 02:35:24.642]  You can also call toll-free to get them 888-253-3139.
[02:35:29.554 --> 02:35:33.076]  And I think a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[02:35:33.076 --> 02:35:37.598]  The best storable foods company in the nation also has the best prices I've found.
[02:35:37.598 --> 02:35:40.300]  The food is packed every day, every week.
[02:35:40.300 --> 02:35:41.600]  None of it is old.
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:46.122]  Most of the other companies, because I bought from two or three others, I guess more than two, it's embarrassing.
[02:35:46.122 --> 02:35:52.186]  It was ancient 5, 10, 15-year-old crap or C-rations from Vietnam.
[02:35:52.186 --> 02:35:56.988]  This is brand new, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:01.632]  And it's high quality right here in America.
[02:36:01.632 --> 02:36:04.755]  Only thing not grown here is the tropical bananas.
[02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:07.117]  But those are non-GMO.
[02:36:07.117 --> 02:36:11.481]  So, efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[02:36:11.481 --> 02:36:13.643]  In this crazy world, folks, you need storable foods.
[02:36:13.643 --> 02:36:16.125]  This is 55% off grocery store prices.
[02:36:16.125 --> 02:36:20.109]  Check out the free videos online at efoodsdirect.com or big...
[02:36:20.589 --> 02:36:23.215]  Banners up on InfoWars.com if you forget.
[02:36:23.215 --> 02:36:25.559]  The web address and the toll-free number is 800-409-5633.
[02:36:25.559 --> 02:36:27.563]  You can call and get a free brochure.
[02:36:27.563 --> 02:36:27.583]  800-409...
[02:36:31.667 --> 02:36:31.948]  I think?
[02:36:53.004 --> 02:36:55.925]  Diginet Personal Audio Video Recorders.
[02:36:55.925 --> 02:36:59.946]  The website is diganet.net.
[02:36:59.946 --> 02:37:11.088]  Now, I, just last year, bought the very same digital video audio recorder pen they have for like $150 to sneak into the Bilderberg group meeting.
[02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:14.529]  And, it's a great pen, but I paid three times as much.
[02:37:15.743 --> 02:37:17.625]  They are a huge bulk seller.
[02:37:17.625 --> 02:37:18.645]  One of the leaders out there.
[02:37:18.645 --> 02:37:19.186]  That's how they do it.
[02:37:19.186 --> 02:37:20.507]  They got a bunch of other systems.
[02:37:20.507 --> 02:37:31.976]  Little hidden cameras that go in your car that are very reliable and wire into just a memory card hidden in the car where you hit one button and you can record the police when they pull you over or anybody else for that matter.
[02:37:31.976 --> 02:37:35.999]  Very, very useful to protect yourself and admissible in court.
[02:37:35.999 --> 02:37:37.140]  Diginet.net.
[02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:38.701]  Fight fire with fire.
[02:37:38.701 --> 02:37:40.342]  Use Big Brother against Big Brother.
[02:37:40.342 --> 02:37:40.902]  Diginet.net.
[02:37:40.902 --> 02:37:41.383]  D-I-G-E-N-E-T.
[02:37:43.126 --> 02:37:45.248]  G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:37:45.248 --> 02:37:45.989]  Diginet dot net.
[02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:48.631]  I want to thank those sponsors for making the show possible.
[02:37:48.631 --> 02:37:53.716]  Be sure and support our local sponsors, AM and FM stations and others that carry the show.
[02:37:53.716 --> 02:37:55.197]  Support them as well.
[02:37:55.197 --> 02:37:56.639]  They make it all possible.
[02:37:56.639 --> 02:37:58.861]  Without them, we wouldn't be here.
[02:37:58.861 --> 02:38:01.904]  Okay, coming up when I start the next hour, we've got Ambassador
[02:38:04.343 --> 02:38:04.603]  I sure am.
[02:38:24.730 --> 02:38:25.871]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:38:25.871 --> 02:38:28.192]  This is Deetra and Tempe.
[02:38:28.192 --> 02:38:29.994]  I have a question for you two gentlemen.
[02:38:29.994 --> 02:38:31.695]  But first I wanted to thank you.
[02:38:31.695 --> 02:38:35.537]  You guys are doing a great job getting all the information out.
[02:38:35.537 --> 02:38:37.639]  I wish more people would wake up.
[02:38:37.639 --> 02:38:42.742]  It's frustrating to see people around you just walking around in a daze, you know.
[02:38:42.742 --> 02:38:43.503]  My question is,
[02:38:44.244 --> 02:38:54.403]  I understand that we're supposed to be the people and they're supposed to take our votes and get our opinions and things like that and obviously that's not happening.
[02:38:54.403 --> 02:38:56.206]  You don't have to be a genius to see that.
[02:38:57.122 --> 02:39:08.988]  What happened to, like, making citizens arrest and impeaching people from Congress and actually, you know, getting them out of office and getting people in there who can do something?
[02:39:08.988 --> 02:39:13.671]  Let me comment on that, Dee, and then we'll get your comeback after Bob comments.
[02:39:13.671 --> 02:39:16.172]  Briefly, this is a whole issue.
[02:39:16.172 --> 02:39:22.775]  The states are constituted by the people, so under state law they can create incorporated cities and counties.
[02:39:22.775 --> 02:39:23.796]  The people.
[02:39:23.796 --> 02:39:25.857]  You can go out in the middle of nowhere and start your own city.
[02:39:26.704 --> 02:39:28.566]  And then you can hire cops.
[02:39:28.566 --> 02:39:30.587]  And then they can go out and give people tickets.
[02:39:30.587 --> 02:39:35.111]  But if you do something outside of the law, you get the book thrown at you.
[02:39:35.111 --> 02:39:40.716]  Instead, the government breaks the law and doesn't get in trouble because they're engaging in corruption.
[02:39:40.716 --> 02:39:45.601]  Citizens arrest was a lot of towns, even towns that might have had a couple thousand people in them.
[02:39:46.414 --> 02:39:51.038]  Would have one sheriff, maybe two deputies for a thousand or more people.
[02:39:51.038 --> 02:40:05.811]  But then, the sheriff had auxiliary deputies, upstanding members of the community, who weren't corrupt, who, if they saw a problem, they would do something, or even if you weren't, if you saw somebody robbing, you'd go over and conk them on the head if they resisted, and citizens arrest.
[02:40:05.811 --> 02:40:11.495]  But the government demonizes that because they don't want, they want a monopoly of power and force.
[02:40:12.356 --> 02:40:19.862]  And so that's why in England, where the citizen's arrest started, under the common law of Magna Carta, they try to demonize people defending...
[02:40:22.025 --> 02:40:23.326]  You know their rights.
[02:40:23.326 --> 02:40:27.567]  And if you even punch somebody robbing your house, they arrest you.
[02:40:27.567 --> 02:40:31.769]  So they have slowly taught us that we don't have rights.
[02:40:31.769 --> 02:40:34.610]  That's why it's important people wear guns in open.
[02:40:34.610 --> 02:40:40.172]  Because, and have demonstrations doing that, showing people we still have a Second Amendment.
[02:40:40.172 --> 02:40:43.133]  Because people think guns are illegal in your house now.
[02:40:43.133 --> 02:40:44.214]  Because the TV told them.
[02:40:44.214 --> 02:40:45.274]  It's all lies.
[02:40:45.274 --> 02:40:47.755]  People think it's the law, you gotta take vaccines.
[02:40:47.755 --> 02:40:49.856]  We're showing the world it's not the law.
[02:40:49.856 --> 02:40:51.237]  We're exposing the hoax.
[02:40:52.037 --> 02:40:52.998]  The mind trick.
[02:40:52.998 --> 02:40:55.979]  Bob Chapman.
[02:40:55.979 --> 02:40:59.421]  Alex, I can't add much to that because you've covered it all.
[02:40:59.421 --> 02:41:09.987]  I think the bottom line is it's very difficult to try to use citizen's arrest today and you could get yourself in trouble by doing so because of the distortion of law.
[02:41:12.898 --> 02:41:14.399]  Well, who can do something?
[02:41:14.399 --> 02:41:25.889]  I mean, just like, I don't know, maybe you guys remember back, uh, I think it was in 2007, Cynthia McKinney was going through the records and, you know, mentioned that there was, what, $3 trillion missing?
[02:41:25.889 --> 02:41:28.612]  And then it just stopped, you know, and that's what happens.
[02:41:28.612 --> 02:41:28.812]  I mean,
[02:41:29.472 --> 02:41:35.496]  People say something, and then they object, and then that's the end of it, and then we move on to the next thing to object.
[02:41:35.496 --> 02:41:36.256]  Exactly!
[02:41:36.256 --> 02:41:42.059]  That's what tyrants and thugs do, is once they've trained you to accept corruption, the sky's the limit.
[02:41:42.059 --> 02:41:43.200]  Thank you, Dee.
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:46.742]  It was $2 trillion when Bush got into office.
[02:41:46.742 --> 02:41:49.664]  It was over $5 trillion by the time he left.
[02:41:49.664 --> 02:41:53.786]  The Pentagon gets up before Congress and says, we're not telling you where the money is.
[02:41:53.786 --> 02:41:55.947]  And they literally laugh at Congress.
[02:41:55.947 --> 02:41:57.628]  Folks, that's why they've stolen $23.7 trillion.
[02:41:59.431 --> 02:42:00.272]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:42:00.272 --> 02:42:03.134]  And they're going to keep right on doing it as long as they can do it.
[02:42:24.838 --> 02:42:25.358]  Absolutely.
[02:42:25.358 --> 02:42:25.998]  Thank you, Deej.
[02:42:25.998 --> 02:42:26.319]  Jeff in Ohio.
[02:42:26.319 --> 02:42:30.280]  You're on the air with the fellow that heads up the internationalforecaster.com.
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:30.580]  Go ahead.
[02:42:53.387 --> 02:42:55.527]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[02:42:55.527 --> 02:43:20.132]  Yeah, I heard you mention earlier in the program, uh, Gary Allen, and I'm curious, though, about, uh, you know, with, uh, you know, and I appreciate what you're doing, you know, trying to expose, you know, the global elites and all that, but have you ever read, uh, Conspiracy, a Biblical View by Dr. Gary North?
[02:43:20.132 --> 02:43:22.612]  I don't believe so, but I've, I've, I've heard of it.
[02:43:23.513 --> 02:43:51.580]  Have you ever, well, yeah, Gary North, he is based in Texas, I believe, but it basically, his premise, and I tend to agree, is that, and this is where I'm concerned and frustrated, is that we try, we've been trying for years to try to expose the elites, yet the thing is,
[02:43:52.594 --> 02:44:02.099]  I'm kind of wondering if Gary North hit it on the head, because he contends that exposure is not enough.
[02:44:02.099 --> 02:44:10.183]  We tend to think that if everybody just knew about these global elites, they'd do the right thing.
[02:44:10.183 --> 02:44:15.106]  He contends, though, that no, that's not necessarily the case.
[02:44:15.956 --> 02:44:22.642]  The thing is, I also remember Edmund Burke says people get the leadership they deserve.
[02:44:22.642 --> 02:44:27.126]  Alright, listen, Jeff, you make a good point.
[02:44:27.126 --> 02:44:29.669]  Let's get a comment from Bob Chapman and then you can follow up.
[02:44:29.669 --> 02:44:31.190]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:36.155]  Well, what is the solution that Mr. North gives us?
[02:44:36.155 --> 02:44:38.677]  Well, he says basically to start
[02:44:39.777 --> 02:44:47.041]  Uh, working from the ground up, from the bottom up, and uh, basically follow biblical ethics.
[02:44:47.041 --> 02:44:50.123]  Well that's exactly what we do, and we have guest after guest after guest.
[02:44:50.123 --> 02:44:52.344]  That's right, that's what I've been doing for 50 years.
[02:44:52.344 --> 02:44:53.825]  And G. Edward Griffin.
[02:44:53.825 --> 02:44:56.886]  I've known Gary North for 30 years.
[02:44:56.886 --> 02:44:57.727]  I know him quite well.
[02:44:58.168 --> 02:45:06.638]  Well, I mean, let's just be clear, and I don't think you're criticizing and implying we're doing this, but we kind of ruffle our feathers and take umbrage.
[02:45:06.638 --> 02:45:13.466]  I have G. Everett Griffin on over and over again about the long view of history, his Freedom Force International.
[02:45:13.466 --> 02:45:15.308]  I believe going for a long view
[02:45:16.409 --> 02:45:19.572]  Shock short view and the middle view.
[02:45:19.572 --> 02:45:21.594]  I say attack on all fronts.
[02:45:21.594 --> 02:45:27.379]  I believe action and motivation and throwing yourself against the gears of the globalist.
[02:45:27.379 --> 02:45:29.480]  You have to first expose it.
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:31.822]  So we're simultaneously doing that and now having
[02:45:32.583 --> 02:45:38.287]  They've gone from saying ten years ago the CFR didn't exist and Rothschilds didn't exist.
[02:45:38.287 --> 02:45:42.691]  There are hundreds of news articles, Bob you remember all this, saying it doesn't exist.
[02:45:42.691 --> 02:45:45.833]  Now they say, oh it exists, but we need a world government.
[02:45:45.833 --> 02:45:47.935]  And so people are saying, no we don't want that.
[02:45:47.935 --> 02:45:53.019]  See if we just try to have solutions at the grassroots, no one knows what we're talking about.
[02:45:53.019 --> 02:45:54.520]  We have to teach them the language.
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:56.061]  It's like we have a different language.
[02:45:56.061 --> 02:45:58.403]  They've forgotten our language of liberty and freedom and history.
[02:45:58.903 --> 02:46:11.610]  So we're like trying to teach Helen Keller how to first understand us so we can then teach her how to how to write and read and you know with braille and all this other stuff so it's a multi what I see is way too many people though
[02:46:12.771 --> 02:46:18.895]  Spending their time critiquing everyone else about the good job they need to do, when how about we just whoop some butt here?
[02:46:18.895 --> 02:46:20.797]  How about we just get in a fight?
[02:46:20.797 --> 02:46:27.321]  Because I don't have time to sit here and quarterback everybody else, and I'm not saying you're bad or Gary's bad or any of this is bad.
[02:46:27.321 --> 02:46:30.483]  My whole issue is, all I talk about is solutions.
[02:46:30.483 --> 02:46:33.245]  Reach out to the military and police to follow their oath.
[02:46:33.245 --> 02:46:34.006]  Huge solution.
[02:46:34.326 --> 02:46:40.988]  Put up posters everywhere exposing Obama as a fraud and the New World Order and giving them a website to go to.
[02:46:40.988 --> 02:46:44.369]  It gets people out, gets them active, gives them a sense of hope.
[02:46:44.369 --> 02:46:45.389]  Go to the town halls.
[02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:46.849]  How many years have I said that?
[02:46:46.849 --> 02:46:48.350]  Take over all their events.
[02:46:48.350 --> 02:46:50.010]  Don't let them have the illusion.
[02:46:50.010 --> 02:46:54.171]  I mean, I'm the guy 14 years ago going and getting arrested at town halls.
[02:46:54.171 --> 02:46:56.872]  Hey, this is, this is, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening.
[02:46:57.492 --> 02:47:03.616]  And taking over the counties, taking over the cities, I was just telling the last caller that we created the towns and cities.
[02:47:03.616 --> 02:47:04.936]  We've got to take them over.
[02:47:04.936 --> 02:47:10.099]  I always say, don't focus on the national election, focus on the local election.
[02:47:10.099 --> 02:47:13.901]  That the national election overall is a diversion, except for issues.
[02:47:13.901 --> 02:47:20.305]  That's why Ron Paul must run in 2012, because even if he has no chance of winning, he's there to inject real issues.
[02:47:20.305 --> 02:47:21.706]  Resistance is victory.
[02:47:21.986 --> 02:47:23.547]  Resistance is victory.
[02:47:23.547 --> 02:47:29.829]  The will to stand up and go, you may kick my butt, but I'm going to fight you as hard as I can.
[02:47:29.829 --> 02:47:32.629]  It's that spirit that cannot be defeated.
[02:47:32.629 --> 02:47:41.312]  And so, I just get mad when I hear it in any way implied that, oh well, you know, this person says this, or, you know, the government we deserve.
[02:47:41.312 --> 02:47:43.073]  Yes, we're getting the government we deserve.
[02:47:43.073 --> 02:47:45.714]  That's why we're saying we're sorry we've been corrupt, God.
[02:47:45.714 --> 02:47:48.695]  We're going to get up off our big fat butts and do something.
[02:47:48.695 --> 02:47:49.555]  Anything else, Jeff?
[02:47:50.765 --> 02:47:54.349]  Yeah, you also mentioned about the language of freedom.
[02:47:54.349 --> 02:48:02.138]  You know, that reminds me of in George Orwell's 1984, you know, they basically destroy words.
[02:48:03.078 --> 02:48:10.541]  And, uh, you know, bend and twist and distort the language so people can't even conceive of the notion of liberty.
[02:48:10.541 --> 02:48:11.602]  Excellent point!
[02:48:11.602 --> 02:48:18.565]  Now they're telling the public to say socialism or say a bad word about government means you want to kill black people.
[02:48:18.565 --> 02:48:19.485]  It's racist.
[02:48:19.485 --> 02:48:26.068]  And some of the public actually believes it now and is calling for my death and saying, you're not allowed to talk bad.
[02:48:26.068 --> 02:48:27.148]  And so I agree.
[02:48:27.148 --> 02:48:30.109]  So we go out and educate them to the hoax.
[02:48:30.109 --> 02:48:30.870]  Appreciate the call.
[02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:31.370]  Bob Chapman.
[02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:41.276]  I agree, but I think we have to look at everybody has a different or somewhat different approach to this.
[02:48:41.276 --> 02:48:45.360]  And you're fighting on all fronts, and I am too.
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:54.687]  Other people aren't, and they can do what they can, and we applaud them for what they're doing, but we're going to do it our way.
[02:48:54.687 --> 02:48:55.248]  Exactly.
[02:48:55.248 --> 02:48:57.490]  I mean, I never tell people how they should do something.
[02:48:58.166 --> 02:48:59.146]  Okay?
[02:48:59.146 --> 02:49:05.429]  And because, I mean, I found in my life, if I start trying, we got too many people trying to be managers here.
[02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:05.789]  Okay?
[02:49:05.789 --> 02:49:11.692]  All I'm saying is, folks, you're smart, you know what to do, you know you're good, you know you're not a New World Order shell.
[02:49:11.692 --> 02:49:18.155]  The last thing the New World Order would tell you to do would be to take action peacefully and believe in yourself and get involved.
[02:49:18.155 --> 02:49:19.395]  People always say, I'm a Fed.
[02:49:19.395 --> 02:49:21.156]  No, no, the Feds would never say that.
[02:49:21.156 --> 02:49:22.417]  That's 180 degrees.
[02:49:22.417 --> 02:49:23.617]  You know you're good.
[02:49:23.617 --> 02:49:24.938]  Let's just decide I'm bad.
[02:49:25.478 --> 02:49:26.558]  Just so the debate's over.
[02:49:26.558 --> 02:49:27.659]  Don't defend me.
[02:49:27.659 --> 02:49:28.799]  Leave Alex in the dust.
[02:49:28.799 --> 02:49:30.699]  I wanted to defeat the New World Order.
[02:49:30.699 --> 02:49:32.940]  Go out then and wake people up.
[02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:33.840]  Warn them.
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:34.820]  Get involved.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:36.001]  You know that's real.
[02:49:36.001 --> 02:49:39.041]  You know you're good, so there's no excuse.
[02:49:39.041 --> 02:49:41.362]  People say, well, they've got better ideas for posters.
[02:49:41.362 --> 02:49:43.503]  Start a poster contest!
[02:49:43.503 --> 02:49:45.463]  I mean, that's what this is all about, folks.
[02:49:45.463 --> 02:49:46.983]  Let's take another call here.
[02:49:46.983 --> 02:49:48.344]  Inger, in Florida.
[02:49:48.344 --> 02:49:48.824]  You're on the air.
[02:49:50.049 --> 02:49:50.569]  Hi Alex.
[02:49:50.569 --> 02:49:51.470]  Hi Bob.
[02:49:51.470 --> 02:49:52.490]  First time caller.
[02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:57.712]  Thank you so much for taking my call and for the awesome job you guys are doing waking up everybody.
[02:49:57.712 --> 02:49:58.532]  Thank you for calling.
[02:49:58.532 --> 02:49:59.213]  Thank you for calling.
[02:49:59.213 --> 02:50:00.913]  Go ahead.
[02:50:00.913 --> 02:50:09.177]  There's been a lot going on in Southwest Florida and I know this isn't probably relative to what you've been talking about just now, but... It's all relative.
[02:50:09.177 --> 02:50:10.017]  Go ahead.
[02:50:10.017 --> 02:50:19.081]  For the last few weeks, there's been hundreds of trucks coming out of the limestone quarry, carrying limestone.
[02:50:19.856 --> 02:50:22.759]  And when I say hundreds, hundreds of trucks.
[02:50:22.759 --> 02:50:27.303]  They're Glover trucks, they're yellow trucks, they have the black tarp on the top to hold the stuff in.
[02:50:27.303 --> 02:50:36.552]  I was just online on the WHO website and that basically they use lime for the mass graves that's in the WHO document.
[02:50:36.552 --> 02:50:38.534]  Oh no, they admit they're preparing mass graves.
[02:50:38.534 --> 02:50:39.736]  I don't know about the anecdotal.
[02:50:40.842 --> 02:50:44.206]  Evidence of limestone trucks.
[02:50:44.206 --> 02:50:45.228]  Stay there.
[02:50:45.228 --> 02:50:46.049]  Stay there, ma'am.
[02:50:46.049 --> 02:50:49.253]  Destruction is kicking back in a little bit, so that might be what that is.
[02:50:49.253 --> 02:50:53.699]  But we'll come back, talk about the mass graves, talk about all the Pentagon martial law drills.
[02:50:53.699 --> 02:50:57.303]  That's all real and up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:57.303 --> 02:50:57.684]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.291 --> 02:51:05.074]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[02:51:05.074 --> 02:51:15.220]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[02:51:15.220 --> 02:51:22.525]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[02:51:22.525 --> 02:51:28.169]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[02:51:28.169 --> 02:51:31.251]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the
[02:51:31.271 --> 02:51:32.712]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBExtract.com
[02:52:01.812 --> 02:52:07.048]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.631 --> 02:52:15.196]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.196 --> 02:52:21.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:23.762]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.762 --> 02:52:26.263]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.263 --> 02:52:37.251]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.831 --> 02:52:39.513]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.513 --> 02:52:41.375]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.375 --> 02:52:48.283]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.552 --> 02:52:58.113]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.113 --> 02:52:59.295]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.277 --> 02:53:11.840]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:13.260]  Garden in a can!

[02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:33.291]  Garden in a can.
[02:53:33.291 --> 02:53:34.492]  It's that simple.
[02:53:34.492 --> 02:53:35.192]  Fresh.
[02:53:35.192 --> 02:53:36.053]  Healthy.
[02:53:36.053 --> 02:53:36.873]  Easy.
[02:53:36.873 --> 02:53:41.216]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[02:54:23.762 --> 02:54:26.223]  Okay, Inger in Florida, finish up.
[02:54:26.223 --> 02:54:31.984]  So, they also get out a limestone, the chemicals that they put in the water.
[02:54:31.984 --> 02:54:37.325]  When you hear the word fluoridation, it means over 300, generally it's about 130 or so.
[02:54:37.325 --> 02:54:40.046]  We got a tour of the Austin Water Treatment.
[02:54:41.010 --> 02:54:49.995]  But it is chemical waste, and they also mine the limestone for fertilizer, for the chemicals they put in fertilizer.
[02:54:49.995 --> 02:54:56.659]  So, I think just seeing some trucks drive around doesn't mean mass graves.
[02:54:56.659 --> 02:55:01.942]  All the official admissions by the federal government and the states of crematoriums and mass graves, though, does.
[02:55:02.921 --> 02:55:04.722]  And Inger, I'm not criticizing you.
[02:55:04.722 --> 02:55:06.602]  We should all keep our eyes open.
[02:55:06.602 --> 02:55:12.065]  But we can keep our eyes open for congressmen and governors saying they're getting ready for martial law and that it's bad.
[02:55:12.065 --> 02:55:16.546]  I mean, this isn't like we're looking for this or anything.
[02:55:16.546 --> 02:55:27.631]  Because the way a strawman operator works is Glenn Beck would take your call from this show and say, look, she thinks it's mass graves from limestone and he'd go to the limestone quarry and they'd say, no, we're doing this for fertilizer.
[02:55:28.251 --> 02:55:31.553]  And then, never look at the hundreds of admissions of the FEMA camp.
[02:55:31.553 --> 02:55:33.574]  See, that's how their twisted system works.
[02:55:33.574 --> 02:55:36.435]  But, tell me more about this.
[02:55:36.435 --> 02:55:39.017]  Okay, I understand exactly what you're talking about.
[02:55:39.017 --> 02:55:48.322]  And, yes, they could totally say that that wasn't what it was for, but these are hundreds and hundreds of trucks, and we've never seen them before, and it's just been in the last few weeks.
[02:55:48.322 --> 02:55:54.405]  And on the WHO website, it clearly says, under there, how to dispose of bodies in an emergency situation.
[02:55:54.813 --> 02:55:55.093]  Thank you.
[02:56:08.787 --> 02:56:12.088]  Um, you know, the pandemic or the flu that they're trying to hide.
[02:56:12.088 --> 02:56:15.550]  Yeah, but they may have just opened up a new aggregate mining facility.
[02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:21.012]  They have those all around where I live, mining marble and granite and limestone.
[02:56:21.012 --> 02:56:24.893]  I mean, all I'm saying is, ma'am, it's all admitted they're building mass graves.
[02:56:24.893 --> 02:56:26.154]  I'm not debating you on that.
[02:56:26.154 --> 02:56:28.635]  I mean, what are the trucks?
[02:56:28.635 --> 02:56:31.336]  I mean, is it blocks of, is it blocks of limestone?
[02:56:32.048 --> 02:56:40.231]  No, it's covered over in, you know, like a black tarp that you see over a truck so the stuff doesn't fly out of it.
[02:56:40.231 --> 02:56:45.173]  And what's weird is this has been going on just now for the last few weeks and it's hundreds of trucks.
[02:56:45.173 --> 02:56:56.217]  But also, just last week in Cape Coral, on August the 7th, my husband took pictures of military helicopters, green ones, flying and they have spray bars on them.
[02:56:56.810 --> 02:57:12.814]  And when my husband asked someone who lived in the neighborhood why, because he was just in that area for the day, why they were there, and he said, oh yeah, we saw it on the news that the military, the army sold the city a whole bunch of used helicopters to spray for mosquitoes.
[02:57:12.814 --> 02:57:14.814]  Well, we don't have that many mosquitoes.
[02:57:14.814 --> 02:57:15.675]  I mean, we have mosquitoes.
[02:57:15.675 --> 02:57:16.255]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:57:16.255 --> 02:57:17.455]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:57:17.455 --> 02:57:21.276]  I want to get Bob's comment here in closing on this.
[02:57:21.276 --> 02:57:24.197]  We'll take more calls with Alan Keyes coming up.
[02:57:28.641 --> 02:57:33.326]  Again, I just don't want to miss the forest for the trees here.
[02:57:33.326 --> 02:57:35.968]  They admittedly have built mass graves.
[02:57:35.968 --> 02:57:39.531]  They admittedly are gearing up for this, 400,000 troops.
[02:57:39.531 --> 02:57:43.615]  Whether they really release a deadly flu or not, this was clearly all staged.
[02:57:43.615 --> 02:57:48.340]  They built up for this beforehand and they're using it to train us for federalization.
[02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:49.341]  Bob, your take on this?
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:58:02.587]  I don't see the government giving used helicopters to Charlotte County or any of that area down there.
[02:58:02.587 --> 02:58:05.388]  They've asked for them for years and got nothing.
[02:58:05.388 --> 02:58:08.530]  It happens I used to live there.
[02:58:08.530 --> 02:58:12.912]  And so I think they were military helicopters.
[02:58:12.912 --> 02:58:15.494]  And they were probably manned by military people.
[02:58:16.186 --> 02:58:24.389]  Well, I was going to say, the Army admits they do all these chemical, biological, and radiological tests on people, so they'll lie to the public with any cover story.

[02:58:37.553 --> 02:58:38.173]  I'll be there.
[02:58:38.173 --> 02:58:38.813]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:38.813 --> 02:58:39.794]  Take care.
[02:58:39.794 --> 02:58:40.254]  Stay with us.

[02:58:50.839 --> 02:58:52.220]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.220 --> 02:58:54.201]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:58:54.201 --> 02:58:54.861]  Well, you should.
[02:58:54.861 --> 02:58:59.684]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[02:59:30.266 --> 02:59:31.727]  This is real.

[02:59:54.063 --> 02:59:56.445]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.445 --> 02:59:59.227]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.618 --> 03:00:23.267]  Well, he is a very, very busy man, and we're very honored to have him for the next 50 minutes or so.
[03:00:23.267 --> 03:00:28.373]  Dr. Alan Keyes, he's also an ambassador, United States Department of State.
[03:00:29.737 --> 03:00:44.389]  Uh, Ronald Reagan appoints Keyes to the United Nations, uh, full ambassador, and he served on the staff of the National Security Council, sought the Republican nomination for President in 96 and 2000, ran against Barack Obama for Illinois State Senate, 2004.
[03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:47.392]  Would have been a lot better than Mr. Obama.
[03:00:48.152 --> 03:00:51.214]  And he warned people that Obama was going to be a radical.
[03:00:51.214 --> 03:00:55.877]  And I really respect Mr. Keyes, but I remember hearing this a year and a half ago, going, oh, come on.
[03:00:55.877 --> 03:00:58.398]  You know, maybe he'll be bad like Clinton.
[03:00:58.398 --> 03:01:00.559]  Who knew he could be even worse?
[03:01:00.559 --> 03:01:01.600]  And so he's with us for the next hour.
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:11.266]  We're going to get into that government health care, the cap and trade, the abortion, expanding funding for abortion in Asia and Africa.
[03:01:11.266 --> 03:01:12.727]  Just his
[03:01:13.849 --> 03:01:21.675]  Ecoscience, written by the mad scientist Holdren, his science czar, which if anybody's a Nazi, it's him.
[03:01:21.675 --> 03:01:25.918]  And then these attacks on free speech, saying you can't say socialist now, it's racist.
[03:01:25.918 --> 03:01:28.820]  That's invoking the race card, in my humble opinion.
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:31.041]  So many issues today.
[03:01:31.041 --> 03:01:34.164]  Ambassador Keyes, it's really great to have you here, sir.
[03:01:34.164 --> 03:01:36.165]  I'm glad to be with you, thank you.
[03:01:36.165 --> 03:01:40.969]  We're going to break in a few minutes and come back to the full audience, but what is most important on your mind right now?
[03:01:40.969 --> 03:01:42.670]  We'll come back and cover that first.
[03:01:43.479 --> 03:01:59.029]  Well, I think there are a couple of things, but the most important thing is the assault on the Constitution, which I think right now is epitomized in the healthcare proposal, which are really seeking to transform our whole way of life, to move us from pre-government to totalitarian government.
[03:02:01.084 --> 03:02:03.305]  Well, I hardly agree with you.
[03:02:03.305 --> 03:02:19.310]  We're starting to see the establishment go from saying all the anger was staged, which obviously it isn't, over 90% of the people there are angry, and most of them Democrats in many cases, to now they're apologizing, saying, okay, you're not thugs, you're not Nazis, you're not AstroTurf.
[03:02:19.310 --> 03:02:20.710]  Is that too little, too late, though?
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:22.660]  Of course it is.
[03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:25.162]  I think we've seen who these people really are.
[03:02:25.162 --> 03:02:33.906]  Their initial reaction was the reaction of offended rulers who are looking at you saying, how dare you question us?
[03:02:33.906 --> 03:02:41.070]  And they have begun to realize that the American people aren't yet at a stage where they're going to act like the peasants and serfs of old.
[03:02:41.070 --> 03:02:48.833]  We are used to being a free people and we're going to stand up and act like it, whether they like it or not.
[03:02:48.833 --> 03:02:49.534]  Absolutely.
[03:02:51.112 --> 03:02:53.295]  The anger is just going across the board.
[03:02:53.295 --> 03:02:58.240]  He lost two more approval points this week, or three, excuse me.
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:06.230]  He has the lowest approval of any president up to this date, seven months into their administration.
[03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:08.693]  What is he going to do to try to save his presidency, do you think?
[03:03:09.650 --> 03:03:11.371]  Well, I think that depends.
[03:03:11.371 --> 03:03:15.714]  I think he came forward because of a deep ideological commitment.
[03:03:15.714 --> 03:03:18.516]  And this is what I try to explain to people for the longest time.
[03:03:18.516 --> 03:03:27.522]  This man is deeply committed to Marxist-Leninism, to the Communist-Marxist-Socialist understanding of the world.
[03:03:27.522 --> 03:03:35.747]  In school, in associations, in background, in both in the Illinois State Senate, in his own activities, this has been the focus of his life.
[03:03:36.527 --> 03:03:42.210]  Uh, and so he is pursuing that agenda and surrounding himself with people committed to it.
[03:03:42.210 --> 03:03:46.112]  Uh, and whatever else is going on, they're not really going to drop it.
[03:03:46.112 --> 03:03:50.535]  Uh, they may have to stop for a while, but they'll probe with a bayonet.
[03:03:50.535 --> 03:03:54.917]  They've met resistance, they'll back off, but they'll keep probing, just as Lenin told them to.
[03:03:56.763 --> 03:03:57.143]  I don't know.
[03:04:18.655 --> 03:04:21.156]  But then they always just come pushing back.
[03:04:21.156 --> 03:04:24.916]  I guess we've got to get on the offensive and then we never back off.
[03:04:24.916 --> 03:04:27.657]  I mean, I guess if we're not on the offensive, we're on the defensive.
[03:04:27.657 --> 03:04:28.897]  That's right.
[03:04:28.897 --> 03:04:31.518]  And I think it's important to do a simple thing.
[03:04:31.518 --> 03:04:33.198]  We're not opposed to their proposals.
[03:04:33.198 --> 03:04:37.179]  We're opposed to them.
[03:04:37.179 --> 03:04:38.559]  Well, they've proven they're liars.
[03:04:38.559 --> 03:04:40.160]  I mean, you can't believe a word they say.
[03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:43.460]  So it's kind of like you have a neighbor you've caught lying to you over and over again.
[03:04:43.460 --> 03:04:46.341]  You just stop associating with them or even some
[03:04:47.793 --> 03:04:53.024]  Certainly start trusting them, and I think we can trust them to continue the march to socialism.
[03:04:53.024 --> 03:04:56.632]  If we don't want it, then we have to look at another direction for leadership.
[03:04:57.992 --> 03:05:00.374]  Ambassador Keyes is our guest.
[03:05:00.374 --> 03:05:01.254]  Alan Keyes, stay with us.
[03:05:01.254 --> 03:05:06.398]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:05:06.398 --> 03:05:10.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:16.344]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.344 --> 03:05:21.408]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.408 --> 03:05:21.908]  Number three,
[03:05:22.308 --> 03:05:28.615]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:05:28.615 --> 03:05:31.518]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:05:31.518 --> 03:05:36.043]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:36.043 --> 03:05:39.647]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:05:39.867 --> 03:05:45.611]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:05:45.611 --> 03:05:50.315]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:06:01.445 --> 03:06:04.447]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.447 --> 03:06:09.772]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.772 --> 03:06:11.833]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.833 --> 03:06:16.817]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.817 --> 03:06:17.738]  How much do you want?
[03:06:17.998 --> 03:06:19.119]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.119 --> 03:06:21.001]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.001 --> 03:06:22.082]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.082 --> 03:06:24.284]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.284 --> 03:06:25.625]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.625 --> 03:06:27.166]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.166 --> 03:06:32.431]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.431 --> 03:06:36.015]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.015 --> 03:06:39.478]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.818 --> 03:06:41.040]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:41.941]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.941 --> 03:06:43.062]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.062 --> 03:06:43.983]  All you can get.
[03:06:43.983 --> 03:06:45.084]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.084 --> 03:06:48.128]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.128 --> 03:06:49.910]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:50.831]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.831 --> 03:07:10.097]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[03:07:10.097 --> 03:07:18.282]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[03:07:18.282 --> 03:07:20.503]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account
[03:07:20.563 --> 03:07:21.183]  We're good to go!
[03:07:47.558 --> 03:07:51.522]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[03:07:51.522 --> 03:07:54.464]  Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:07:54.464 --> 03:07:56.326]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:07:56.326 --> 03:07:56.786]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[03:07:56.786 --> 03:07:57.707]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:57.707 --> 03:07:58.908]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.359 --> 03:08:19.586]  Well, he's a best-selling author, researcher, former ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan.
[03:08:19.586 --> 03:08:22.308]  He needs no introduction.
[03:08:22.308 --> 03:08:26.032]  One of his websites is loyaltoliberty.blogspot.com.
[03:08:26.032 --> 03:08:32.257]  Got that up on screen as we simulcast the radio show on the web slash as a TV show.
[03:08:32.257 --> 03:08:35.240]  He also writes for World Daily and other big publications.
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:37.122]  Unhealthy for Liberty is one of his latest
[03:08:37.722 --> 03:08:37.862]  I don't
[03:08:54.315 --> 03:09:02.359]  We see the town halls, the people, Republican, Democrat, old, young, black, white, coming out and saying, we don't want this.
[03:09:02.359 --> 03:09:05.460]  And they have copies of the bill, they have the subsections.
[03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:11.603]  The Democrats for three weeks tried to lie, and even some Republicans did, and say, that's not in there, this isn't in there.
[03:09:11.603 --> 03:09:16.446]  Now they're having to admit all the things we said were in there that were in there, and apologizing
[03:09:19.528 --> 03:09:22.090]  How do we ensure that this resistance continues?
[03:09:22.090 --> 03:09:26.132]  Because as you just said, they're going to continue to come back, probing.
[03:09:26.132 --> 03:09:30.354]  You know, they put the pressure on, we resist, they back off.
[03:09:30.354 --> 03:09:37.258]  I mean, give us your battle plan of how to not just hold them off, but actually regain some ground.
[03:09:37.258 --> 03:09:40.360]  Because you know, Ambassador, we've lost so much liberty.
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:43.762]  Well, I think that we have to be clear about what it is we're opposing.
[03:09:44.774 --> 03:09:56.241]  Because I think that the present overwhelming response to this health care program reminds me a little of what happened on the immigration bill when they were trying to destroy our sovereignty.
[03:09:56.241 --> 03:10:00.864]  You're not just looking at an opposition to specific proposals and elements.
[03:10:01.636 --> 03:10:23.929]  I think what happened is, some of these things, particularly for instance, the provisions that seem targeted at rationing care for the elderly, at setting up a system that would pressure people into accepting death and giving up therapy, side by side with provisions that might expand funding for illegal immigrants, which would therefore be being paid at the expense of
[03:10:24.409 --> 03:10:27.333]  Our loved ones are being encouraged to die.
[03:10:27.333 --> 03:10:31.978]  These things were rejected because they fundamentally offend conscience.
[03:10:31.978 --> 03:10:38.765]  They seem contrary to the American way of life and the understanding we have of the intrinsic worth of human beings.
[03:10:38.765 --> 03:10:42.610]  With that in mind, you look at the whole picture, there are the invasive elements
[03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:50.274]  Uh, that would take control, first of all, of the health sector, of the terms of remuneration of doctors and things of this kind.
[03:10:50.274 --> 03:10:54.216]  So they claim that it's not aimed at phasing out the private sector.
[03:10:54.216 --> 03:10:55.957]  Two things are true.
[03:10:55.957 --> 03:11:02.641]  Barack Obama himself, in his early career, explicitly said he was for universal single payer, right?
[03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:12.225]  And then it comes out a proposal that has elements in it that, yes, over the course of a little time are going to push the system in that direction.
[03:11:12.225 --> 03:11:20.329]  And these elements are backed by the big corporate guys who are trying to get out from under the health care costs so they can have bigger profits.
[03:11:20.329 --> 03:11:23.570]  Are we all supposed to be stupid that we don't realize what's happening?
[03:11:23.570 --> 03:11:24.050]  Of course not.
[03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:24.931]  People do realize it.
[03:11:26.198 --> 03:11:48.938]  Then you look at what's going on overseas, with Canada and Great Britain as other examples, and it turns out that there is rationing, there is pressure for the old people, there are long lines, there is poor access, there is lower quality in terms of medical personnel and so forth, and so the notion that everybody's going to have access is countervailed by the fact that they'll have access to a worse system
[03:11:49.498 --> 03:12:01.252]  In which they'll get worse service, in which they will no longer have the depth that a whole bunch of people have in America, that when something goes wrong with you, it's dealt with expeditiously, right?
[03:12:01.252 --> 03:12:02.553]  That won't even be there.
[03:12:02.553 --> 03:12:06.177]  And so I think people are looking at this saying, wait a minute, this is not America.
[03:12:06.177 --> 03:12:07.379]  This is not how we live.
[03:12:08.291 --> 03:12:13.012]  And we have been relying on a system that, yes, has its shortcomings.
[03:12:13.012 --> 03:12:25.236]  You know, they say that we're supposed to let government take over 100% of our lives because we want to care for the 10% of people who they say don't have access to some kind of health insurance right now.
[03:12:25.236 --> 03:12:26.276]  That doesn't make sense!
[03:12:26.912 --> 03:12:30.053]  So, I think a lot of people have begun to suspect the truth.
[03:12:30.053 --> 03:12:32.374]  The aim of this is to improve healthcare.
[03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:53.162]  The aim of it is to give that power to government over life and death and finances and privacy and personal decisions, so that we'll be in a position where we must hang on the decisions and words and power of the people in power, which gives them great control, so that they can remain in power at our expense.
[03:12:53.642 --> 03:12:56.644]  That is what totalitarian government is all about.
[03:12:56.644 --> 03:12:58.786]  That's what socialist takeovers are about.
[03:12:58.786 --> 03:13:02.389]  They use issues in order to achieve power.
[03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:05.731]  They're not really interested in the result.
[03:13:05.731 --> 03:13:08.914]  Wow, Ambassador Alan Keyes is our guest.
[03:13:08.914 --> 03:13:12.717]  Absolutely amazing how you just laid it all out and everything you were saying there
[03:13:13.757 --> 03:13:30.664]  is true because right in front of me today ABC News and MSNBC and the New York Times in my stack they spin it like it's good and they go look the big insurance companies look the big doctors unions look all these special interests are getting together
[03:13:31.224 --> 03:13:31.625]  I don't know.
[03:13:47.068 --> 03:13:53.216]  Congressman Conyers says they can't read a 1300 page bill, but the government can then implement all our health care.
[03:13:53.216 --> 03:13:59.905]  I mean, they can't get anything right, and really they're just grabbing the whole industry for themselves.
[03:13:59.905 --> 03:14:02.669]  So I'd like you to comment on that, and then secondarily,
[03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:16.034]  It's come out that White House-funded groups ACORN and others, I mean here's the actual ad, defend President Obama's health care plan over August recess, $500 a week, now is your chance to make health care work.
[03:14:16.034 --> 03:14:22.677]  Here they are, JobsThatMatter.org, a Democratic-funded group, paying people, and then they got caught
[03:14:23.577 --> 03:14:38.882]  ObamaCamp plant fake document and Shay Guevara fan at Jackson Lee Forum and they got caught with this woman who works for this lady right here in the shot who works with Obama famously in the photo with her and Shay Guevara
[03:14:39.622 --> 03:14:51.866]  And then here she is, faking, going to staged questioners, posing as doctors, saying, so even the few people that they go to at their own town halls, it's staged, Ambassador!
[03:14:51.866 --> 03:14:56.088]  They've been accusing us of it being staged, they are caught staging it!
[03:14:56.088 --> 03:15:02.610]  Well, see, but this corresponds, and I hope a lot of people, well, maybe a lot of people don't, but one of the standard practices
[03:15:03.211 --> 03:15:03.491]  I don't
[03:15:18.311 --> 03:15:18.671]  We're good.
[03:15:36.525 --> 03:15:40.129]  These people are simply showing themselves to be exactly what they are.
[03:15:40.129 --> 03:15:53.021]  A bunch of leftists following the handbook of the communists, trying to impose this system on the people of the United States against our will, with lies and staged manipulations of perception and so forth.
[03:15:53.021 --> 03:15:59.827]  Exactly, as Olinsky and others have recommended to the left-wingers that they do.
[03:15:59.827 --> 03:16:00.708]  And also, of course,
[03:16:01.630 --> 03:16:10.457]  Max of the tactics that were used during the era of the first National Socialist Bush, the right-wing National Socialists, we call them Nazis, right?
[03:16:10.457 --> 03:16:18.864]  And they had the same kind of approaches for manipulating politics and practiced the same effort to vilify their opponents.
[03:16:19.484 --> 03:16:36.719]  And to dehumanize them in various ways with name-calling and junk like this, just as these people are now trying to pretend that anybody who looks at this on the basis of the facts, analyzes it in light of the ideology and what it's all about, calls what they're doing socialism.
[03:16:36.719 --> 03:16:40.903]  And you've had these people standing up and saying, well, it's racist, that's just the code word for race.
[03:16:40.903 --> 03:16:42.585]  What nonsense is this?
[03:16:42.585 --> 03:16:44.166]  Do they really think we're that stupid?
[03:16:45.333 --> 03:16:49.894]  Well, I mean, they clearly, Ambassador, and I want your opinion on this, it's cold-blooded!
[03:16:49.894 --> 03:16:52.015]  They know!
[03:16:52.015 --> 03:17:08.180]  They took all these well-meaning people that voted for Obama, I know a lot of rednecks around here in Texas did, to prove they weren't racist, wanting to have everybody live together in peace, and then now cold-bloodedly these poverty pimps, these Annenberg Foundation people, these Ford Foundation people,
[03:17:08.980 --> 03:17:34.922]  knowingly come in and say if you disagree with cap and trade if you disagree with his policies on government health care you are a racist and I get hundreds of emails a week saying that I'm secretly a white supremacist because we posted the Obama Joker photo saying socialism I mean isn't that really the racism or invoking the racism as divide and conquer cold-bloodedly
[03:17:35.402 --> 03:17:37.563]  Absolutely, but then, think about it.
[03:17:37.563 --> 03:17:42.886]  The whole Obama effort was a cold-blooded invocation of race.
[03:17:42.886 --> 03:17:48.930]  Everything about what these people did was a cold-blooded effort to play the race card.
[03:17:48.930 --> 03:17:51.351]  And that's what it was all about.
[03:17:51.351 --> 03:18:03.218]  And the whole idea that you should vote for somebody not because of the color of their skin, but because of their qualities and characteristics and your agreement with what they were trying to do that was right for the country, that they threw out.
[03:18:04.359 --> 03:18:13.148]  And, of course, now they want it thrown out because most people look at what he's up to, realize that people like myself were not exaggerating.
[03:18:13.148 --> 03:18:16.792]  You had a lot of people that said, oh, that's just extremism, you're exaggerating.
[03:18:16.792 --> 03:18:17.793]  No, he's not like that.
[03:18:17.793 --> 03:18:19.615]  His speeches are so moderate.
[03:18:19.615 --> 03:18:23.719]  But that's because, as we're discovering, the man's a pathological liar.
[03:18:23.719 --> 03:18:24.200]  I'm sorry.
[03:18:24.847 --> 03:18:26.048]  He lied.
[03:18:26.048 --> 03:18:27.408]  And he is studied at it.
[03:18:27.408 --> 03:18:28.809]  He is skillful at it.
[03:18:28.809 --> 03:18:34.892]  He is a shrewd actor, as it were, that turns his whole person and delivery into the lie.
[03:18:34.892 --> 03:18:37.514]  But nonetheless, it does not correspond with the truth.
[03:18:38.764 --> 03:18:41.285]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[03:18:41.285 --> 03:18:44.367]  You live in Illinois, you knew him, and I respect you.
[03:18:44.367 --> 03:18:49.929]  I interviewed you for D Magazine back in the mid-90s, interviewed you again on radio many years ago.
[03:18:49.929 --> 03:18:53.031]  I respected you and thought that you were right.
[03:18:53.031 --> 03:18:57.273]  I just thought, well, Keyes doesn't usually have any rhetoric, but man, is Obama this bad?
[03:18:57.273 --> 03:19:05.857]  I mean, I wasn't for Obama, but I remember the speeches you gave and the warnings, and now it's all true, and that's what's concerning me.
[03:19:06.892 --> 03:19:09.656]  That's one of the problems, I guess, I have in life.
[03:19:09.656 --> 03:19:13.202]  I'm dealing with issues right now, whether it's the healthcare issue, the eligibility issue.
[03:19:13.202 --> 03:19:16.527]  People always try to pretend that there's some motive involved.
[03:19:16.527 --> 03:19:19.752]  I just try to look at things and call them as I see them.
[03:19:20.273 --> 03:19:27.415]  Based on the knowledge and experience that I've had, I try to clearly share with people conclusions that I think make sense.
[03:19:27.415 --> 03:19:31.216]  And that's what I tried to do in that case, and the facts were clear.
[03:19:31.216 --> 03:19:40.398]  And therefore, I feel that if you're a public person, you have an obligation to share that true understanding as best you can with the people that you're talking to.
[03:19:41.584 --> 03:19:47.886]  Well, since you gave those speeches and talked about him wanting to force abort babies, it's now been confirmed.
[03:19:47.886 --> 03:19:48.727]  Let's go over.
[03:19:48.727 --> 03:19:51.628]  You know this gentleman.
[03:19:51.628 --> 03:19:54.849]  You know who the president really is and who his controllers are.
[03:19:54.849 --> 03:19:58.510]  So let us in to your expertise on the other side.
[03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:59.711]  Ambassador Keyes is our guest.
[03:20:01.684 --> 03:20:02.985]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.985 --> 03:20:08.571]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.571 --> 03:20:13.595]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.595 --> 03:20:18.620]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:20:19.167 --> 03:20:24.392]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.392 --> 03:20:31.499]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.499 --> 03:20:32.620]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:39.326]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.326 --> 03:20:42.509]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:42.509 --> 03:20:44.331]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:44.711 --> 03:20:45.652]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.652 --> 03:20:45.852]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.852 --> 03:20:49.296]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:49.296 --> 03:20:51.017]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:21:02.043 --> 03:21:07.845]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.845 --> 03:21:15.427]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:21:15.427 --> 03:21:21.589]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:22.009 --> 03:21:23.990]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:26.492]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:26.492 --> 03:21:38.060]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:21:38.060 --> 03:21:39.741]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.741 --> 03:21:41.602]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.602 --> 03:21:47.846]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.493 --> 03:21:56.760]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.760 --> 03:21:58.342]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.342 --> 03:21:59.523]  The people strike back!
[03:22:01.260 --> 03:22:01.820]  Good day.
[03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:03.501]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:03.501 --> 03:22:03.761]  August 14, 2009.
[03:22:03.761 --> 03:22:04.702]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5910.
[03:22:04.702 --> 03:22:08.503]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.8644, $4.9322 for the half-ounce, or $2.4661 for a quarter-ounce.
[03:22:08.503 --> 03:22:08.803]  That's $9.8644, $4.9322, and $2.4661.
[03:22:19.366 --> 03:22:30.299]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[03:22:30.299 --> 03:22:33.663]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[03:22:33.663 --> 03:22:37.187]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[03:22:37.187 --> 03:22:40.070]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[03:22:40.290 --> 03:22:43.172]  Minus has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[03:22:43.172 --> 03:22:46.255]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:46.255 --> 03:22:48.677]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[03:22:48.677 --> 03:22:51.679]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.679 --> 03:22:55.542]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.542 --> 03:22:55.723]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.917 --> 03:23:02.598]  Attention!
[03:23:02.598 --> 03:23:17.661]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:23:17.941 --> 03:23:26.589]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[03:23:26.589 --> 03:23:32.514]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[03:23:32.514 --> 03:23:38.400]  Silica is a precursor to calcium meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:44.425]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter and with an
[03:23:44.585 --> 03:23:48.088]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:48.088 --> 03:23:49.670]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:12.029 --> 03:24:21.276]  Loyalty to Liberty.blogspot.com Ambassador Keys, are there any other sites or books or materials?
[03:24:21.276 --> 03:24:22.517]  What's some of your latest work?
[03:24:22.517 --> 03:24:24.678]  The World Net Daily articles?
[03:24:24.678 --> 03:24:25.299]  For people that want to...
[03:24:26.127 --> 03:24:30.410]  The major outlet for what I write these days, the most important one, is Loyal to Liberty.
[03:24:30.410 --> 03:24:31.871]  That's Loyal to Liberty.
[03:24:31.871 --> 03:24:34.612]  L-O-Y-A-L-T-O-L-I-B-E-R-T-Y.
[03:24:34.612 --> 03:24:38.755]  You can also reach it, by the way, just by typing in alankeys.com.
[03:24:38.755 --> 03:24:41.257]  A-L-A-N-K-E-Y-E-S dot com.
[03:24:41.257 --> 03:24:49.242]  It goes to the same place, because that's now become my major vehicle for sharing on a regular basis thoughts and writings of various lengths.
[03:24:49.942 --> 03:25:00.324]  I'm also serializing what I hope will become a couple of books that periodically I'm putting chapters up on the blog there for people to look at, and so forth.
[03:25:00.324 --> 03:25:12.387]  I also am writing for WorldNetDaily, and I'm heavily involved in the work of America's Independent Party, which has a website, AIP News, A-I-P-N-E-W-S, AIP News.
[03:25:12.867 --> 03:25:13.447]  We're good to go.
[03:25:37.103 --> 03:25:38.344]  We want to take America back.
[03:25:38.344 --> 03:25:40.485]  The people must become the media.
[03:25:40.485 --> 03:25:57.096]  We must use the tools that are available so we're no longer relying on the corporate bought-and-paid-for media outlets that now are working for some of these big business enterprises that are essentially the fellow travelers of the Obama Socialists.
[03:25:57.659 --> 03:26:07.563]  And that more and more is happening, so they're openly saying, with the hate crimes law and the cyberbullying, that if something hurts someone's feelings, you're going to be federally charged.
[03:26:07.563 --> 03:26:10.524]  That's actually in the bills, I couldn't believe it.
[03:26:10.524 --> 03:26:14.846]  And especially the cyberbullying, so they're certainly coming after our free speech.
[03:26:14.846 --> 03:26:20.828]  They're not only saying that, saying it's socialism, is racist,
[03:26:21.738 --> 03:26:28.461]  Which is incredible race-baiting in my opinion, and as you said, cold-bloodedly using it to drive a wedge.
[03:26:28.461 --> 03:26:42.928]  But they're now calling for the arrest of people that put up Obama posters on light poles, but Obama was in the Washington Post telling his supporters to put up his hope sign on stop signs, which is illegal.
[03:26:42.928 --> 03:26:45.229]  So, just the level of hypocrisy.
[03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:56.933]  Well, I think, though, it goes beyond hypocrisy, because hypocrisy would imply that it's almost just a function of the circumstances of a particular case.
[03:26:56.933 --> 03:26:58.154]  It's not.
[03:26:58.154 --> 03:27:05.056]  This is the strategy whereby you dehumanize, demoralize, and destroy any opposition.
[03:27:05.836 --> 03:27:13.201]  You build up your own camp so that they become the exclusive, have the exclusive access, really, to public opinion.
[03:27:13.201 --> 03:27:28.791]  And then you try to mobilize the force of law and law enforcement and the state, eventually including, of course, arresting and trying people and throwing them into jail or camp because they are dissenting from your policies.
[03:27:29.370 --> 03:27:38.614]  That's something that was systematically characteristic of these socialist regimes of the right and left, whether it's the Nazi regime or the old Soviet regime.
[03:27:38.614 --> 03:27:43.497]  These socialist regimes, all of them took this approach to politics.
[03:27:43.497 --> 03:27:54.402]  And of course, they also adopted the famous Rahm Emanuel repeated dictum that you want to take advantage of a good crisis, right?
[03:27:55.194 --> 03:27:57.416]  And advance your agenda using it.
[03:27:57.416 --> 03:28:00.718]  And that, of course, includes manufacturing it if you don't have one.
[03:28:00.718 --> 03:28:04.241]  So that if you don't have a good crisis, you make one up, you cause one.
[03:28:04.241 --> 03:28:07.464]  I think that's one of the reasons why he's so irresponsible about spending.
[03:28:07.464 --> 03:28:20.854]  He actually wants to push us deeper and deeper into a critical and desperate economic situation that will justify consolidating more and more power in the hands of the government that he controls.
[03:28:20.854 --> 03:28:22.155]  That's a standard practice.
[03:28:22.676 --> 03:28:29.448]  It just breaks my heart that because of the end of the Cold War, you know, when we were actively confronted by the Soviets...
[03:28:30.054 --> 03:28:37.239]  People were more aware on a daily basis of who these people were, what they did, what practices they carried forward.
[03:28:37.239 --> 03:28:40.981]  It was something that you grew up with and knew and understood.
[03:28:40.981 --> 03:28:45.764]  I think we have now had, what is it, 20, 30 years in which that's become less and less the case.
[03:28:45.764 --> 03:28:54.590]  And you have a lot of folks now who don't realize that what we're watching is simply part of a pattern that was common from the mid-20th century folks.
[03:28:55.103 --> 03:29:07.714]  Yeah, and in case you don't know, sir, it's up on InfoWars.com, we have at least six different, in English, two in Spanish, Florida news reports, and several of them call for my arrest.
[03:29:07.714 --> 03:29:09.776]  I didn't come up with the Obama Joker poster.
[03:29:09.776 --> 03:29:11.277]  I saw it in LA.
[03:29:11.277 --> 03:29:13.999]  Nationally, they said it was racist, you should be arrested.
[03:29:13.999 --> 03:29:18.483]  So I put it up on my site, and I said, folks, we've got to stand up to this attack on free speech.
[03:29:18.483 --> 03:29:20.425]  Post these in legal places everywhere.
[03:29:21.065 --> 03:29:24.686]  Now, they're on the news calling for my arrest.
[03:29:24.686 --> 03:29:27.387]  So, I can think of nothing more un-American, Ambassador.
[03:29:27.387 --> 03:29:32.589]  I want to get your take on that and get back to the question of, you know what makes them tick.
[03:29:32.589 --> 03:29:34.290]  You've been proven to be right about them.
[03:29:34.290 --> 03:29:36.470]  What are they going to try next?
[03:29:36.470 --> 03:29:43.153]  And then I want to get into some other issues, like governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[03:29:43.153 --> 03:29:49.175]  Obama wants to put 400,000 troops on the streets of America.
[03:29:49.175 --> 03:29:50.075]  You can't make this up.
[03:29:51.656 --> 03:29:55.583]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.583 --> 03:29:58.268]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.135 --> 03:30:05.376]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.376 --> 03:30:07.376]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.376 --> 03:30:15.898]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.898 --> 03:30:21.440]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.440 --> 03:30:23.060]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.300 --> 03:30:29.824]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.824 --> 03:30:40.870]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.870 --> 03:30:41.330]  That's right.
[03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:44.211]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[03:31:01.041 --> 03:31:06.348]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:31:06.348 --> 03:31:10.894]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:10.894 --> 03:31:13.157]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:13.157 --> 03:31:14.779]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:14.779 --> 03:31:15.821]  There is a solution.

[03:32:06.302 --> 03:32:11.407]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:32:11.407 --> 03:32:12.908]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:32:12.908 --> 03:32:16.511]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[03:32:53.991 --> 03:32:56.275]  Again that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:33:05.725 --> 03:33:08.848]  We're going back to Ambassador Alan Keyes here in just a moment.
[03:33:08.848 --> 03:33:12.851]  His website is LoyalToLiberty.blogspot.com.
[03:33:12.851 --> 03:33:15.233]  We've got that up on the screen right now.
[03:33:15.233 --> 03:33:17.075]  I'm sure everybody will give it to you again before he leaves us.
[03:33:17.075 --> 03:33:18.456]  He's with us right to the end of the show.
[03:33:18.456 --> 03:33:20.037]  Another 25 minutes or so.
[03:33:20.037 --> 03:33:20.758]  Very honored to have him.
[03:33:20.758 --> 03:33:24.742]  I want to thank the sponsor of this hour of the show, Acola Blue.
[03:33:25.562 --> 03:33:27.585]  And it is an atmospheric water generator.
[03:33:27.585 --> 03:33:34.192]  It grabs seven and a half gallons out of the air a day and then sends it through reverse osmosis, a carbon filter, a bunch of other stuff.
[03:33:34.192 --> 03:33:35.874]  It's just a great unit.
[03:33:35.874 --> 03:33:37.175]  Ecoloblue.com.
[03:33:37.175 --> 03:33:38.917]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.
[03:33:38.917 --> 03:33:42.321]  Again, that's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:33:42.321 --> 03:33:43.082]  Or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[03:33:46.502 --> 03:33:47.443]  I have this in the office.
[03:33:47.443 --> 03:33:49.004]  I have this in my home.
[03:33:49.004 --> 03:33:51.505]  Just an amazing system.
[03:33:51.505 --> 03:33:53.227]  And it doesn't come out of the tap.
[03:33:53.227 --> 03:33:54.267]  There's no fluoride.
[03:33:54.267 --> 03:33:55.148]  Nothing in it.
[03:33:55.148 --> 03:33:56.409]  And then it goes through seven filters.
[03:33:56.409 --> 03:33:59.551]  A coloblue.com or 800-691-6043.
[03:33:59.551 --> 03:33:59.791]  800-691-6043.
[03:33:59.791 --> 03:34:06.475]  And I remember years ago listening to Mr. Key's radio show.
[03:34:06.475 --> 03:34:07.056]  So informative.
[03:34:07.056 --> 03:34:08.237]  He doesn't do that anymore.
[03:34:08.237 --> 03:34:12.339]  But he's all over talk radio and TV and we always enjoy having him.
[03:34:12.339 --> 03:34:13.960]  And he got arrested!
[03:34:13.960 --> 03:34:15.842]  You could be there pro-abortion.
[03:34:16.702 --> 03:34:17.683]  You just couldn't be against it.
[03:34:17.683 --> 03:34:20.246]  We're going to talk about that coming up in a few minutes.
[03:34:20.246 --> 03:34:24.870]  But sir, continue with the free speech issue.
[03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:32.578]  How can you put up signs with Bush as the Joker, Bush as a vampire, and I wasn't a fan of Bush tripling the size of government.
[03:34:32.578 --> 03:34:36.802]  Now Obama's tripled it in seven, eight months though, so he obviously even worse.
[03:34:36.802 --> 03:34:38.164]  I didn't know that was possible.
[03:34:38.164 --> 03:34:40.206]  How do you, how do these people
[03:34:41.567 --> 03:34:43.508]  In fact, take the Village Voice.
[03:34:43.508 --> 03:34:47.830]  They put out, Bush is the vampire, killing the Statue of Liberty, drinking its blood.
[03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:58.374]  The very artist came out and said, no, it's okay to show Bush bad, but because Obama is partially African, you are not allowed to.
[03:34:58.374 --> 03:35:01.896]  I mean, it's just, they've got so much bravado.
[03:35:01.896 --> 03:35:08.979]  They're just so incredibly arrogant and just so over the top, they have no shame.
[03:35:08.979 --> 03:35:11.020]  Can you comment on what makes them tick?
[03:35:11.460 --> 03:35:13.482]  And the attacks on your free speech?
[03:35:13.482 --> 03:35:16.003]  Well, first of all, I think it's purely ideological.
[03:35:16.003 --> 03:35:21.287]  These people come from a point of view which basically says whatever we say goes.
[03:35:21.287 --> 03:35:23.249]  If we do it, then it's acceptable.
[03:35:23.249 --> 03:35:25.871]  If our opponents do it, then it's unacceptable.
[03:35:25.871 --> 03:35:33.376]  And you make them suffer for what they do in whatever way you can because there is no such thing as a standard of truth.
[03:35:34.031 --> 03:35:37.332]  That's the most important thing to keep in mind when listening to their words and everything.
[03:35:37.332 --> 03:35:59.702]  The ordinary notion that you are trying to speak the truth and make sense and that you have respect for some standard of reasonableness and common sense and logic and factuality, none of it applies to them as it did not apply to the people who edited Pravda in the old Soviet Union, as it never applied to, did not apply to the Goebbels propaganda under the Nazis.
[03:35:59.702 --> 03:36:02.363]  These people aren't about speaking the truth.
[03:36:03.089 --> 03:36:15.287]  They are simply about imposing their will by manipulating people's minds, by cutting off others so that they won't have access, won't be able to make arguments, and only allowing...
[03:36:16.118 --> 03:36:19.759]  Their voice and their understanding and their interpretation to be heard.
[03:36:19.759 --> 03:36:23.180]  And they are moving forward to implement that understanding.
[03:36:23.180 --> 03:36:31.803]  Which of course is contrary to everything that Americans have professed to believe over the course of pretty much our entire history.
[03:36:31.803 --> 03:36:41.825]  That notion of free and open and sometimes even raucous discussion and debate has been a hallmark of what our society is all about.
[03:36:41.825 --> 03:36:43.466]  But now that's being thrown away.
[03:36:44.614 --> 03:36:49.081]  Ambassador, specifically, you've grown up, lived in Illinois.
[03:36:49.081 --> 03:36:51.044]  You know him as a state senator, as a U.S.
[03:36:51.044 --> 03:36:52.006]  senator.
[03:36:52.006 --> 03:36:53.688]  You're aware of his activities.
[03:36:53.688 --> 03:36:56.392]  So can you give us a snapshot of him?
[03:36:56.392 --> 03:36:58.776]  Because, I mean, specifically, here's the question, though.
[03:36:59.719 --> 03:37:05.284]  Even if you agree with his policies or disagree, I've never seen one this flagrantly or slickly lie.
[03:37:05.284 --> 03:37:07.766]  He makes Clinton look like a poor liar.
[03:37:07.766 --> 03:37:08.706]  He's a great actor.
[03:37:08.706 --> 03:37:13.410]  He should be in Hollywood because he gets up and says, I will have no lobbyists anywhere.
[03:37:13.410 --> 03:37:14.831]  They will not write the laws.
[03:37:14.831 --> 03:37:16.713]  He hires more than anybody ever has.
[03:37:16.713 --> 03:37:18.815]  He says, I'll have total transparency.
[03:37:18.815 --> 03:37:22.498]  He keeps all of Cheney's secrecy and more, and then even makes it secret
[03:37:22.958 --> 03:37:26.560]  Who comes to the White House, where you even worked, taking it to a new level?
[03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:39.526]  So can you comment on knowing who he really is, and how he seems to enjoy lying, and one of the few people I've seen who can lie, and it looks like he's telling the truth.
[03:37:39.526 --> 03:37:42.327]  Well, first of all, I don't want to pretend.
[03:37:42.327 --> 03:37:44.948]  One, I did not grow up in Illinois.
[03:37:44.948 --> 03:37:47.890]  You know I ran there, but I ran there on invitation.
[03:37:49.359 --> 03:38:02.853]  I learned about Barack Obama as I was engaging in the preparations and carrying out of that campaign effort.
[03:38:02.853 --> 03:38:08.979]  It is not a personal thing, and I never pretend that I have some special personal slant on Barack Obama.
[03:38:08.979 --> 03:38:09.720]  I don't know about that.
[03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:34.180]  What I do know, I know from facts, from the positions he's taken, and from the facts that one can garner and that are now being shared more on the internet and elsewhere, but that were hidden from the American people because the media clack of the Obama faction, the people who are kind of stupefied by their zealous support of Obama, did not share these facts with the American people.
[03:38:34.700 --> 03:38:37.423]  Uh, and so they were promoting a false understanding.
[03:38:37.423 --> 03:38:41.967]  Uh, so in a sense, I came at Barack Obama from an objective point of view.
[03:38:41.967 --> 03:38:45.610]  Not from a point of view of any kind of special knowledge or animus of any kind.
[03:38:45.610 --> 03:38:47.151]  Uh, like a lot of Americans.
[03:38:47.151 --> 03:38:48.793]  I didn't even know him from Adam.
[03:38:49.460 --> 03:38:50.241]  Let me just stop you.
[03:38:50.241 --> 03:38:51.001]  Let me just stop you.
[03:38:51.001 --> 03:38:57.545]  I just figured since you were a little state senator that nobody had ever heard of until he started being pushed.
[03:38:57.545 --> 03:39:05.530]  And what's interesting is when you get to know more about his background, there were forces that were obviously helping to move him along.
[03:39:05.530 --> 03:39:09.352]  There are questions about who funded his education and all of these kinds of things.
[03:39:09.352 --> 03:39:14.595]  It looked like somebody had it in mind to prepare him for us even though they weren't preparing us for him.
[03:39:15.629 --> 03:39:17.691]  Okay, well I apologize for my ignorance.
[03:39:17.691 --> 03:39:39.287]  I figured since you were running in Illinois, and since you knew, I mean I remember seeing you a year and a half, two years ago, speeches on YouTube, hearing you on the radio, you were so accurate about him, I was just guessing that you must have been in and around him in politics, but I guess you just did a crash course in research when you saw him being pushed and propelled by all these special interests?
[03:39:39.287 --> 03:39:44.911]  Sometimes, sometimes you can be accurate simply because you bring an objective state of mind to the fact.
[03:39:45.511 --> 03:39:48.632]  And are willing to let them instruct you.
[03:39:48.632 --> 03:39:52.714]  And that, I guess, is all I can claim in terms of any understanding.
[03:39:52.714 --> 03:39:53.114]  Okay, good.
[03:39:53.114 --> 03:39:59.317]  Break down, then, who he really is and what he would like to do if we weren't blocking him right now.
[03:39:59.317 --> 03:40:00.757]  What would Barack Obama be doing?
[03:40:00.757 --> 03:40:01.898]  Who is he?
[03:40:01.898 --> 03:40:07.360]  Well, I think Barack Obama wants, at the very least, to impose a Chavez-style socialism.
[03:40:08.407 --> 03:40:13.071]  On the United States, and to do so in a way that alters our Constitution.
[03:40:13.071 --> 03:40:24.681]  He has no respect for the Constitution, believes that the whole idea of limited government constrains the government from doing what the elitists think is good, and interferes with their freedom of action.
[03:40:25.201 --> 03:40:28.282]  And therefore, he wants to throw it out the window.
[03:40:28.282 --> 03:40:34.143]  They also seem to believe in what you might call a majority tyranny.
[03:40:34.143 --> 03:40:46.125]  So that if you win an election, you then have license to do whatever you want and no longer have to pay any attention to individual rights, to the rights of the minority group of voters that don't support the things you're doing.
[03:40:46.125 --> 03:40:48.146]  All of that overthrown.
[03:40:48.146 --> 03:40:53.187]  The patterns are patterns that we see in contemporary life with somebody like Chavez.
[03:40:53.687 --> 03:40:59.810]  Uh, and they're patterns that we have seen in the past, as I've been saying, with these other socialist regimes.
[03:40:59.810 --> 03:41:02.872]  So none of it, in that respect, is surprising.
[03:41:02.872 --> 03:41:10.936]  And he just seems to be cut from an ideological cloth that came from his background, his association with people like Bill Ayer.
[03:41:11.636 --> 03:41:12.477]  We're good to go.
[03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:44.999]  And which lifts up the notion that individuals are no different than stones or rocks or any other material things, and should be arranged and ordered by the will of the ruler, so that their ideas and understanding of what is right for the society can be carried out.
[03:41:45.319 --> 03:41:53.791]  The whole moral understanding that puts an intrinsic value on individuals that started with our Declaration of Independence, he also rejects.
[03:41:53.791 --> 03:41:58.919]  And once you realize that you're dealing with somebody whose moral universe
[03:41:59.899 --> 03:42:09.164]  It has rejected the fundamental premise of liberty that most Americans kind of take for granted, even when they can't fully articulate them.
[03:42:09.164 --> 03:42:12.446]  Then you are a long way toward understanding what he's about.
[03:42:12.446 --> 03:42:13.966]  And what does he want to do?
[03:42:13.966 --> 03:42:14.947]  He wants to impose.
[03:42:15.427 --> 03:42:19.849]  That kind of controlling socialist government on the United States.
[03:42:19.849 --> 03:42:21.750]  Does he think it's going to do us good?
[03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:33.855]  I imagine so, but I've got to tell you, when you see somebody so unwilling to look at the factual truth, and a lot of these leftists are and have been for the whole of my lifetime,
[03:42:34.355 --> 03:42:34.955]  Amazing points.
[03:42:53.777 --> 03:43:03.545]  Dealing with lying, though, you worked in the White House with Ronald Reagan, and even if you disagreed with him or loved him or hated him, Reagan didn't do a lot of lying.
[03:43:03.545 --> 03:43:05.447]  I mean, he really was honest.
[03:43:08.271 --> 03:43:11.412]  I mean, his policies were very transparent.
[03:43:11.412 --> 03:43:17.113]  In fact, there wasn't any lying, as much I can tell, which is universes away from Clinton.
[03:43:17.113 --> 03:43:24.835]  Bush certainly did some deceptive things, but Obama, I mean, you've been around presidents, you've been an ambassador, you've been in these campaigns.
[03:43:24.835 --> 03:43:28.916]  Is it safe to say, or would you disagree with my perspective, that he is the
[03:43:30.123 --> 03:43:31.864]  Greatest liar I've ever seen.
[03:43:31.864 --> 03:43:33.164]  A new level of lying.
[03:43:33.164 --> 03:43:34.845]  I mean, I've read books about Hitler.
[03:43:34.845 --> 03:43:36.165]  I've read books about other people.
[03:43:36.165 --> 03:43:41.407]  It seems that Obama is really the slickest liar I've ever seen.
[03:43:41.407 --> 03:43:43.187]  I'm not sure.
[03:43:43.187 --> 03:43:57.912]  You know, I think part of the reason he appears so right now is because the mass of the American people kind of aren't used to having to assume that the person they're dealing with is, how can I put it, not just lying.
[03:43:57.912 --> 03:43:59.573]  They are constructing a fiction.
[03:44:00.563 --> 03:44:00.623]  Yes.
[03:44:20.296 --> 03:44:22.798]  Those people aren't really who they're pretending to be.
[03:44:22.798 --> 03:44:28.441]  Their inflections and tones do not reflect feelings they really have, and so forth and so on.
[03:44:28.441 --> 03:44:33.825]  And yet, because they're good at what they do, we accept it and are drawn into that world.
[03:44:33.825 --> 03:44:42.090]  Well, imagine that you're dealing with people for whom every aspect of public life is that kind of acted-out fiction.
[03:44:43.224 --> 03:44:56.356]  They're pursuing their objective and they just want to get you to come in and believe the world is what it needs to be so that they can achieve their power, achieve their objective, achieve what they want to achieve.
[03:44:56.356 --> 03:44:57.958]  That's Barack Obama.
[03:44:57.958 --> 03:45:00.240]  And to say he's great is a lie.
[03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:03.663]  We're not used to having such thoroughgoing actors.
[03:45:04.505 --> 03:45:07.748]  With no respect for truth in American politics.
[03:45:07.748 --> 03:45:09.009]  Yeah, we're used to liars.
[03:45:09.009 --> 03:45:10.270]  People lie.
[03:45:10.270 --> 03:45:16.415]  But underlying it all, there's been this assumption that the aim, somehow, is still to respect the truth.
[03:45:16.415 --> 03:45:19.498]  That's not the case with these folks, because they don't believe it anymore.
[03:45:19.498 --> 03:45:31.088]  You know, the notion of the self-evident truths that establish our rights, that show clearly that justice somehow has a basis that isn't just based on the power of those who rule over you.
[03:45:31.088 --> 03:45:32.109]  They reject all of that.
[03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:47.697]  I think right now very striking to us because Americans kind of have had the luxury of taking it for granted that overall this is not what American life and politics was about.
[03:45:47.697 --> 03:45:50.439]  But now we're having to deal with a very real
[03:45:52.193 --> 03:46:04.644]  This way of doing politics, which overtook Europe, which overtook countries in the third world, and which radically transformed those countries into gulags and hellish places of oppression, it has now come to America.
[03:46:05.563 --> 03:46:10.049]  Wow, you know what, I rarely have epiphanies these days from guests.
[03:46:10.049 --> 03:46:15.375]  I mean, I get a lot of good points, a lot of good ideas, but you just actually shifted my perspective.
[03:46:15.375 --> 03:46:22.163]  I mean, I know it's a matrix, I know it's a facade, a Wizard of Oz lie, but the way you just explained it, you're right.
[03:46:22.163 --> 03:46:23.625]  It's that the mainstream media
[03:46:24.506 --> 03:46:36.135]  And the system is playing to his tune with such choreographed precision that it creates a whole Disneyland of lies.
[03:46:36.135 --> 03:46:42.559]  So it's not just Bill Clinton saying, I didn't have sex with that woman or lying about, you know, corruption.
[03:46:42.559 --> 03:46:45.702]  It's that the whole thing is a lie.
[03:46:45.702 --> 03:46:46.342]  Well, exactly.
[03:46:46.342 --> 03:46:52.787]  They are creating, as it were, a perceived reality that serves their purposes.
[03:46:53.406 --> 03:47:00.831]  And, of course, the ground started to be laid for this years ago, when these people started that phony mantra, Perception is Reality.
[03:47:00.831 --> 03:47:02.052]  Perception is reality.
[03:47:02.052 --> 03:47:03.293]  This is not true!
[03:47:03.293 --> 03:47:05.435]  Not if God exists, at least.
[03:47:05.435 --> 03:47:18.844]  Because there is a principle of reality that transcends human perception and understanding, and is the basis for making real judgments in a rational way about what is right, what is wrong, what should or should not be done.
[03:47:19.284 --> 03:47:34.930]  They rejected that notion of having such a basis for morality, and the only standard they claimed is a scientific one, but of course, remember, science cannot tell us anything about what is right and what is wrong, what is just, what is unjust.
[03:47:34.930 --> 03:47:36.191]  Science can't address that.
[03:47:37.314 --> 03:47:38.716]  Sir, we've got limited time.
[03:47:38.716 --> 03:47:46.708]  We've got about 12 minutes left and I'm even going to skip this network break so we have this time with you because I've got several other questions I want to get to and certainly have you back up in the near future.
[03:47:46.708 --> 03:47:49.913]  Very honored to have Ambassador Alan Keyes on with us today.
[03:47:49.913 --> 03:47:51.014]  Very thought-provoking.
[03:47:53.672 --> 03:48:00.737]  Especially, perception isn't reality, if the person giving you the perception is putting false data in, or lying, or distorting.
[03:48:00.737 --> 03:48:17.190]  I mean, if you're wearing a headset of virtual reality goggles, and you see a flat, green fielder walking in, but really you're about to walk off a hundred-story building, you're gonna fall and die, the goggles are lying to you, perception isn't reality, but that was just me backing you up there.
[03:48:17.190 --> 03:48:18.431]  Well, think of it, think of it.
[03:48:18.431 --> 03:48:21.513]  This is exactly what they were trying to do with this healthcare business.
[03:48:22.378 --> 03:48:27.900]  Tell it on the basis that we're going to give everybody access, it's going to be better, and it's going to be less costly, and all of this.
[03:48:27.900 --> 03:48:46.266]  And then when you started to get into the detail, it wasn't actually less costly, they were just going to shift the distribution of the cost, so that the elderly citizens and so forth were going to be targeted in particular for rationing, so that those costs could be distributed differently.
[03:48:46.266 --> 03:48:50.567]  That while everybody's going to have access and so forth, but the burden of paying for that
[03:48:51.107 --> 03:48:54.310]  And the government's got a whole new tax to pull out of your paycheck.
[03:49:15.882 --> 03:49:16.222]  Exactly.
[03:49:16.222 --> 03:49:17.303]  We've got 10 minutes left here.
[03:49:17.303 --> 03:49:19.525]  I want to ask you quick questions now.
[03:49:19.525 --> 03:49:24.870]  Eugenics, from my research ambassador, is the foundation of these control freaks.
[03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:29.954]  They believe we're all just blobs of protoplasm, so why not get rid of 80% of us?
[03:49:29.954 --> 03:49:34.238]  United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96, State Department Memorandum 200, Eric Holder,
[03:49:39.045 --> 03:49:58.128]  All these other people, John P. Holdren, John P. Holdren, Ecoscience, Population, Resources, Environment, calls for forced drugging the water to sterilize us, forced abortion, CPS taking basically all children, raising them in government hives, and I have all these other government textbooks, and you're a learned person, you're aware of this,
[03:49:58.769 --> 03:50:28.122]  uh... exposing the whole abortion agenda which is only one level and then he he unfreezes the money for forced abortion and uh... you know where they say oh you'll get the welfare in africa but we've got to sterilize you can you speak john p holdren and the whole eugenics situation and and what margaret sanger and the whole abortion industry really is but that is one of those things that uh... what will be a good one of the reasons i i i have been so uh... clear
[03:50:28.786 --> 03:50:32.973]  About his absolute, adamant commitment to this whole abortion thing.
[03:50:32.973 --> 03:50:39.203]  So that he carried it as far as saying that babies born alive should be allowed to die because their mothers wanted them aborted.
[03:50:40.130 --> 03:50:43.232]  That is a reflection of what you're talking about.
[03:50:43.232 --> 03:50:50.277]  Sometimes people think this is just about the specific, particular murder of that baby that the abortion itself involves.
[03:50:50.277 --> 03:50:51.058]  No!
[03:50:51.058 --> 03:50:52.119]  You look at Margaret Sanger.
[03:50:52.119 --> 03:50:58.463]  That woman was about a strategy based on eugenics for basically cleansing the world of the inferior people.
[03:50:59.183 --> 03:51:12.154]  It is an inherently elitist understanding that sees no value or intrinsic worth except in those lives that stand up to the measuring rod of these elitists as somehow valuable to humankind.
[03:51:12.154 --> 03:51:19.860]  In one respect, it turns out that as the left-wingers move down this road, they are implementing a dehumanizing understanding.
[03:51:20.222 --> 03:51:35.768]  But instead of dehumanizing people based on the racist notions of somebody like Hitler and the things that were being portrayed in Germany, they dehumanize people based on the scientific understanding that there's nothing essentially human about us.
[03:51:35.768 --> 03:51:43.150]  That we are, in that sense, just blobs of flesh and chemicals and junk that can be manipulated like any other physical thing.
[03:51:43.150 --> 03:51:47.312]  And that, of course, means that there's no boundaries whatsoever that you have to respect
[03:51:47.612 --> 03:51:51.075]  Except the whimsical boundaries of personal attachment.
[03:51:51.075 --> 03:51:55.058]  So that if you're part of the favored clique, you might be treated differently.
[03:51:55.058 --> 03:51:57.140]  That's the world they're pushing us toward.
[03:51:57.140 --> 03:52:05.927]  And abortion was essentially the cutting edge to get people implicated in a moral understanding that's destroyed our sense.
[03:52:06.167 --> 03:52:21.441]  That humanity and every single human being have a moral worth that must be respected by the power of government that can't be disregarded on the basis of some elitist measuring rods of who's worth having around and who can be killed with impunity.
[03:52:23.902 --> 03:52:38.886]  Ambassador, isn't this really the religion of control freaks on power trips where Peter Singer says let parents kill their babies for a year after they're born, get rid of the old people, they've got the same value as mackerel.
[03:52:38.886 --> 03:52:50.329]  I mean, these are quotes saying an old person has the same value as a fish, that a retarded child needs to be killed, and I found they really are the ultimate racist as
[03:52:51.269 --> 03:52:54.893]  As Margaret Sanger wrote in her own letters to D.B.
[03:52:54.893 --> 03:53:01.920]  Du Bois, she said, I've got to hire black men to be my fronts to get rid of these black weeds.
[03:53:01.920 --> 03:53:10.708]  In my research, I found that the real racists, the real Nazis, always cloak themselves as liberals, and that it's even more than that.
[03:53:10.708 --> 03:53:13.912]  It's not just some pseudoscience and their excuse to play God.
[03:53:14.392 --> 03:53:28.211]  That they ravenously enjoy going after Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, poor people, it doesn't matter, and that they even have people of color in their ranks who enjoy this!
[03:53:29.414 --> 03:53:47.584]  Well, you know, the sad thing is, underlying it all, there is an element of what I call self-worship involved in this, that is involved in the fascination these elites have for themselves and their own power, and the confirmation they see when they enjoy a little success that's somehow better than everybody else.
[03:53:48.264 --> 03:54:03.535]  That even, by the way, accounts for their so-called compassion, because it affirms their superiority to see themselves from a height helping the downtrodden who, because of their inferiority, couldn't do as well, and so forth and so on.
[03:54:03.535 --> 03:54:07.558]  But remember, that kind of self-worship has an implication.
[03:54:08.418 --> 03:54:22.871]  That goes to the very heart of religion and faith and spirituality, because it denies that there is anything other than themselves that is worthy of that kind of real reverence.
[03:54:22.871 --> 03:54:28.696]  And so, it is premised at the end of the day on the banishing of God from the consciousness of human beings.
[03:54:29.336 --> 03:54:40.846]  And that's why people like myself who put a great stress on the American Declaration, on the fact that our unalienable rights come from the hand of Almighty God, we are their deep enemy.
[03:54:40.846 --> 03:54:49.433]  Because we will not let people forget the existence of God and the fact that most of us accept that and believe it.
[03:54:49.946 --> 03:55:06.730]  Well, Ambassador, when you read, as I know you have, all these futurists and transhumanists and neo-eugenicists that just fill the government ranks, Dr. Piankas and the Holdrens and Ehrlichs, they actually believe they're God.
[03:55:06.730 --> 03:55:16.033]  In the BBC, there was a report last year where they said, we're going to split off and be an elite species of the government planner, and then all the rest of you are these sub-humans.
[03:55:16.033 --> 03:55:16.673]  I mean, you're right.
[03:55:17.173 --> 03:55:22.155]  But it's not just that they don't want to say God doesn't exist, they're saying, I am God.
[03:55:22.155 --> 03:55:28.559]  Well, you see, but I think that's a return to something quite old in terms of human injustice.
[03:55:28.559 --> 03:55:43.466]  Remember that when the people of the world were subjected to these old oligarchic aristocratic regimes, you know, the nobles and the peasantry and all of this, the myths of the time were centered on apotheosis.
[03:55:44.051 --> 03:55:48.964]  That is, where the elite, because of their success and achievements and greatness...
[03:55:49.542 --> 03:55:51.824]  They are elevated to the status of God.
[03:55:51.824 --> 03:55:53.525]  That happened to the Caesars.
[03:55:53.525 --> 03:55:54.786]  That happened to others.
[03:55:54.786 --> 03:56:01.992]  The aim, therefore, in that pagan understanding was for these people to transform themselves to God-like status.
[03:56:01.992 --> 03:56:17.024]  And all we're seeing is a return of that age-old chivalry now being used once again to impose the idea of some kind of inherent superiority of these elites upon people whom they intend en masse to oppress.
[03:56:17.518 --> 03:56:18.058]  Amazing.
[03:56:18.058 --> 03:56:20.480]  Ambassador, we've got to have you back up on this subject.
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:22.240]  Last question.
[03:56:22.240 --> 03:56:25.062]  Governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[03:56:25.062 --> 03:56:27.043]  That's from The Hill, newspaper in D.C.
[03:56:27.043 --> 03:56:28.444]  as you know.
[03:56:28.444 --> 03:56:31.445]  Congressman could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[03:56:31.445 --> 03:56:33.506]  Congressman told the Louisville Journal.
[03:56:33.506 --> 03:56:41.030]  Congressman Paul Brown said they may use it to declare martial law as a cover for Obama because his agenda.
[03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:45.532]  Pentagon wants authority to post 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[03:56:45.532 --> 03:56:45.873]  I mean,
[03:56:46.773 --> 03:57:03.777]  This is unbelievable, and we now hear Obama saying terrorists, right-wing terrorists, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the DOD documents, and the Justice Department, Homeland Security, veterans and gun owners, and Ron Paul supporters are terrorists.
[03:57:03.777 --> 03:57:10.499]  In the last two minutes, can you comment on that, and are you concerned that Obama may stage crises, as Michael Savage and others have said?
[03:57:11.357 --> 03:57:20.001]  Well, I think we're seeing, again, a reliable pattern that was there in the 20th century versions of this imposition of communism.
[03:57:20.001 --> 03:57:23.923]  The blurring of the distinction between the military and law enforcement.
[03:57:23.923 --> 03:57:28.885]  The destruction of the idea that human beings have individual rights.
[03:57:28.885 --> 03:57:36.709]  Instead, there's some national security threat that overrides those rights and justifies making use of any kind of
[03:57:37.069 --> 03:57:37.629]  We're good to go.
[03:58:00.635 --> 03:58:01.235]  We're good to go.
[03:58:30.935 --> 03:58:32.276]  From Apple.
[03:58:32.276 --> 03:58:32.836]  Amazing.
[03:58:32.836 --> 03:58:35.817]  Ambassador Alan Keyes, I look forward to having you back up.
[03:58:35.817 --> 03:58:39.959]  The website is loyaltoliberty.blogspot.com.
[03:58:39.959 --> 03:58:41.779]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:58:41.779 --> 03:58:42.540]  Glad to be with you.
[03:58:42.540 --> 03:58:43.680]  Thanks for having me.
[03:58:43.680 --> 03:58:44.260]  Thank you, sir.
[03:58:44.260 --> 03:58:46.281]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.281 --> 03:58:48.582]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.547 --> 03:58:56.490]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:59:21.547 --> 03:59:22.047]  We're good.
