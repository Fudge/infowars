[00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.869]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:43.230]  The Red River is slowly receding at Fargo, North Dakota.
[00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.351]  But a breach in the dike protecting the city's north side has flooded a school campus.
[00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:51.613]  But it wasn't serious enough to warrant the evacuation of nearby residents.
[00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:55.034]  Robin Litby is a spokeswoman for the City of Fargo.
[00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:58.215]  We've just asked them to plug their sewers and to monitor their basements.
[00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.276]  Waters may remain dangerously high for a week.
[00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:06.726]  And the Obama administration is readying a fresh aid for General Motors and Chrysler.
[00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:10.428]  The two automakers have already received more than $17 billion.
[00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:16.109]  GM is asking for more than $16 billion in new aid, while Chrysler wants another $5 billion.
[00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.551]  The administration is expected to insist on tough cost-cutting measures.
[00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:22.207]  Here's Ken Thomas.
[00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:29.930]  It has an impact on communities throughout the country in terms of supplier jobs, dealer jobs, and the like.
[00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.472]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:35.313]  My name is John Demartino.
[00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:39.295]  I'm from Colorado, and I started using Andy Willoughby's Three-Step Plan.
[00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:49.220]  It's extremely encouraging for me, and they've given me training on exactly what to say, and I don't have to be a salesman to talk to people that are calling me.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.862]  It's made me feel like, wow, let's do business.
[00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:57.265]  I can only conceive of growing and growing and growing now.
[00:01:57.505 --> 00:02:00.527]  I'm 56 years old, and I feel young.
[00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:01.788]  I feel renewed.
[00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:02.628]  I'm happy.
[00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:04.770]  I'm excited about my financial future.
[00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.153]  In a short amount of time, less than an hour a day, if someone wanted to, they could have a system.
[00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:13.515]  This is a stress-relieving business.
[00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:15.197]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:16.438]  This is Andy Whittleby.
[00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:20.461]  After five years, the 3-Step Plan is a proven success story.

[00:02:34.013 --> 00:02:39.635]  President Barack Obama makes his first overseas presidential visit this week to some of America's closest allies.
[00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:47.199]  The president is widely popular among the European public and may learn this week whether the same holds true for European leaders.
[00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:52.121]  His agenda includes the global financial meltdown and the fight against terror.
[00:02:52.708 --> 00:03:00.398]  An Israeli official close to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says there's a slim chance of a prisoner swap deal with Hamas before Olmert leaves office.
[00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:07.727]  The official says contacts are ongoing, but he assumes matters will wait for the new government, which will be sworn in next week.
[00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:11.389]  And college basketball's Final Four is shaping up.
[00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.312]  Connecticut will be there, along with Big East rival Villanova.
[00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:19.756]  Villanova beat Pitt last night, while UConn topped Missouri.
[00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:26.241]  Later today, Louisville takes on Michigan State, and North Carolina plays Oklahoma for the two other spots.

[00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.843]  Two weeks of EverCleanse may be equal to months of dieting.

[00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:07.518]  A number of deadly incidents are being reported across Afghanistan.
[00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.501]  Here's Jason Strasioso.
[00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:16.284]  The insurgent attacks on a roadside bomb killed ten Afghan security force members and at least four incidents across Afghanistan.
[00:04:16.664 --> 00:04:22.846]  A roadside bomb killed three Afghan army commanders on patrol Saturday in eastern Pakhtia province's Gardez district.
[00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:28.147]  Alaska's Mount Redon volcano continues to spew out towering columns of thick ash.
[00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:32.268]  An eruption early Saturday produced a cloud nearly five miles high.
[00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:36.990]  There have been about a dozen bursts in a series of eruptions that began last weekend.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.802]  Anna Karabara is an Anchorage resident.
[00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:41.144]  It's an odd glow.
[00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:44.046]  It's like being on maybe a different planet or something.
[00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:45.608]  It's not really dark.
[00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:46.529]  It's not dusk.
[00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:51.393]  It's almost like a deep blue hue or something.
[00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:53.115]  And it's also very quiet.
[00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:59.882]  Iraqi troops using loudspeakers ordered Sunni security volunteers in a Baghdad neighborhood to turn in their weapons today.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.862]  The arrest of their leader has sparked fierce gun battles between the former U.S.
[00:05:04.962 --> 00:05:07.263]  allies and American and Iraqi troops.
[00:05:07.883 --> 00:05:10.244]  The arrests could have long-term implications.
[00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:11.725]  Here's Robert Reed.
[00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:20.149]  With the crackdown on the group in Frontal, similar organizations in other parts of Baghdad are now quite concerned that this may be the beginning of a government crackdown.
[00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.334]  If that's the case, it would seriously undermine U.S.
[00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:28.884]  efforts to stabilize Baghdad before American troops are due to pull out of the cities at the end of June.
[00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.270]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.

[00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.430]  Welcome, welcome, and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.572]  We're gonna be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:20.992 --> 00:07:23.813]  Central Standard Time with a syndicated transmission across the country.
[00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:25.279]  And the world.
[00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:30.841]  It is the 29th day of March 2009.
[00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:38.805]  Economist, author, historian Webster Griffin Tarbley will be with us for an hour and 45 minutes today.
[00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:41.867]  And we come back in the next segment later in the next hour.
[00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:43.328]  I see the phone lines are already loaded.
[00:07:43.728 --> 00:07:45.529]  We will start going to your calls next hour.
[00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:49.371]  So for folks that are already holding, you can either hold or call back next hour.
[00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:52.532]  We have a host of important issues to talk about.
[00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:58.878]  Webster wrote a book ten years ago detailing the derivatives bubble, the central bank setting up world government through controlled bankruptcy.
[00:07:59.758 --> 00:08:03.562]  We're going to be discussing that in detail and what the real Barack Obama agenda is.
[00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.904]  He's written two books on Barack Obama.
[00:08:05.924 --> 00:08:11.668]  He also wrote the unauthorized biography, Groundbreaking Research on George Herbert Walker Bush, back in the early 1990s.
[00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:13.170]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:30.757]  Luke Rudowsky, who's 22 years old and founded We Are Change, an activist group that goes around at press conferences and other events confronting politicians about serious issues of government-sponsored terrorism, globalization, the New World Order.
[00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:34.160]  He also does freelance reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:08:34.898 --> 00:08:41.462]  He went to ask Mayor Bloomberg questions, as he's done many times, at an event at a major hotel in New York City.
[00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:43.423]  They grabbed him and didn't tell him to leave.
[00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:47.506]  They just grabbed him and charged him with trespassing with two other We Are Change members.
[00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.187]  We have a story on that up at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:54.470]  He's still in jail and is reportedly going to be arraigned tomorrow for trespassing.
[00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:02.315]  They also then told him he wasn't a member of the press, as if a blogger or anybody else, whether you work for the New York Times or the Associated Press or a blog,
[00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:16.832]  The First Amendment is your right to go to press conferences and ask questions, and it was advertised, you know, as an open hotel with restaurants and bars, and that's where he went to ask him the question, and he's been seized upon, along with two other people, so the details of that are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:17.352 --> 00:09:20.334]  I did a little emergency broadcast last night, internet only.
[00:09:20.674 --> 00:09:31.803]  We always have thousands of people, even when I'm not live, listening to the rebroadcast audio streams at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, and I was at my studios in South Austin, our main TV studios,
[00:09:32.935 --> 00:09:35.796]  Interviewing Webster Tarpoli for a second Obama film that we're making.
[00:09:35.816 --> 00:09:50.682]  We've got Jesse Ventura and Webster Tarpoli and Gerald Cilente and economist George Humphrey and KRS-One, Rap Icon, so many others in the Obama deception that's the megaviral film on the internet right now, sending shockwaves all over the place.
[00:09:50.702 --> 00:09:52.143]  So thanks to you out there spreading the word.
[00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:55.324]  And then we got the call, so I was able to go in and do about 15 minutes.
[00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.985]  I want to thank folks for calling.
[00:09:57.025 --> 00:09:59.145]  The 18th Precinct still has busy phones.
[00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.486]  The last time I checked,
[00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:05.834]  Because we called down there at about nine when we learned of it and said, listen, you're saying you're in a lot of trouble, young man.
[00:10:05.854 --> 00:10:06.794]  You're not really press.
[00:10:07.294 --> 00:10:08.315]  Your press pass is fake.
[00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:10.056]  There's no such thing as Infowars.com.
[00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:12.497]  So I called up politely and said, no, that's a real reporter.
[00:10:12.517 --> 00:10:14.839]  You can't make up some charge about impersonating a reporter.
[00:10:15.339 --> 00:10:16.580]  And they were very rude and hung up on me.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.722]  So we just gave their number out on air to let them know that we're fully aware of what they're doing there and tracking it.
[00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:26.981]  So I'll cover that more tomorrow once Luke is out of jail on the weekday show from 11 to 3 p.m.
[00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:27.901]  Central Standard Time.
[00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:30.624]  And while Webster is visiting us from Washington, D.C.
[00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:42.554]  and Maryland where he's based, he's also going to be with me for the first hour on the show tomorrow, and then he's going to drive the airport and leave back home doing several other interviews the next few weeks on the new Obama film,
[00:10:42.938 --> 00:10:46.320]  I'm making because the crimes of this administration are accelerating so fast.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:55.185]  You know, we talk about forced compulsory national service in the film from his Chief of Staff's book he wrote, speeches Obama and Rahm Emanuel gave.
[00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:58.526]  Now they have introduced a host of bills.
[00:10:59.347 --> 00:11:12.454]  Up until Thursday, it still had the provisions in several of the bills, 1388 and others, for forced national compulsory quasi-domestic military service, senior corps, secure corps,
[00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:21.722]  Military training, a Stalin-esque or Lenin-esque or Hitler-Jugen literal type move, and those got pulled out.
[00:11:21.822 --> 00:11:27.025]  But now a new bill, and it's up on InfoWars.com, Kurt Nimmo wrote a story about it, but it's also in the Associated Press.
[00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:34.891]  A new bill has been introduced to do just that, and I'll also be telling you about that later in the radio show today.
[00:11:36.614 --> 00:11:41.296]  Now, there are hundreds of versions of the Obama deception that has been uploaded for free to the web.
[00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:46.018]  You know, we posted it first two weeks ago at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:50.640]  PrisonPlanet.tv, our members' website, where it's in near-DVD quality.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.702]  All of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, in an E-format.
[00:11:54.742 --> 00:11:59.584]  My weekly TV shows, we simulcast the weekday radio show on the Internet.
[00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:05.329]  For folks, visually, the radio show isn't just a video cam.
[00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:09.251]  We have video feeds, high-quality cameras, you know, it's a full-news production.
[00:12:10.372 --> 00:12:12.974]  And so that's there for PrisonPlanet.tv members as well.
[00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:16.056]  And now we're adding more shows to my studios in Austin.
[00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:21.039]  We have Jason Burmess there also doing a show, and Samuel Kessing with the Genesis Network, 9 to Midnight.
[00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:24.681]  So all of that's going on for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:27.143]  But folks went and grabbed it as we asked them to do.
[00:12:27.885 --> 00:12:34.248]  Uh, and then uploaded hundreds of copies to every file sharing network, YouTube, Google, Blip TV, LiveLeak, all of them.
[00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:40.351]  But a lot of them, people were so hasty to upload them that it wasn't uploaded in the highest quality for free for everybody.
[00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:47.235]  But we found a great encode of the Obama deception for free on YouTube, and the guy has a director's channel, so it's not in ten minute blocks.
[00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:50.076]  It's the full, close to two hour film there.
[00:12:50.826 --> 00:12:53.028]  Absolutely free for everybody.
[00:12:53.488 --> 00:12:56.410]  And so you just Google the Obama deception.
[00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.991]  You just Google the Obama deception.
[00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.792]  And it's the first, the second, the third link.
[00:13:00.832 --> 00:13:01.913]  It's always changing every day.
[00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:05.475]  It's the one that says Obama deception in high quality full film.
[00:13:06.135 --> 00:13:09.297]  And that one has over 800,000 views as of today.
[00:13:09.878 --> 00:13:18.423]  If you count up the hundreds of other versions that we've gone and looked at on the web, it's now over 15 million views in only two weeks for free.
[00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:22.472]  And so I want to thank all of you that are spreading the word about the Obama Deception.
[00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:36.563]  If you want to support myself, the filmmaker, and these films that cost in excess of $100,000 a piece to make, please buy the high quality DVD of the Obama Deception at InfoWars.com, and of course it has the extras on it as well.
[00:13:37.544 --> 00:13:43.429]  Or watch it in super high quality, you can burn it to DivX, which plays on most DVD players just by pointing and clicking.
[00:13:44.248 --> 00:13:47.590]  And people are out there already spreading thousands of these out across the country.
[00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:58.457]  I know many people are made already with five hundred a thousand copies because you can burn the DivX version in high quality to a regular computer CD and it plays in almost all the new DVD players.
[00:13:58.477 --> 00:14:03.020]  I think his mic's on.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.701]  But all of that is going on.
[00:14:06.782 --> 00:14:10.044]  And so again, it's very, very exciting to have that happening.
[00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:11.365]  Use PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:14:13.822 --> 00:14:20.344]  To go in there, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, you know, that just pays for our high-quality servers to put it out in super high quality.
[00:14:20.704 --> 00:14:31.408]  And then get regular CDs, pop them in, and then point and click, burning it to DivX onto the CD or DVD, and it is just ultra-massive what's happening.
[00:14:31.688 --> 00:14:42.571]  We're not just spreading this virally with over 14 to 15 million views on the web in two weeks, the number one viral video on the web, on its way to topping even loose change that I was involved in, executive producing the final cut.
[00:14:43.762 --> 00:14:56.352]  People are actually getting the physical copies and getting them out to everybody, but the way you really support us is with a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, or you can make more films, or by buying the high-quality DVD at InfoWars.com, or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:14:56.412 --> 00:15:01.736]  And you can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:15:10.518 --> 00:15:18.660]  But again, when we come back from this quick break, you're not going to hear a lot from me in the first 45 minutes or so, because I'm going to sit back and ask Webster Tarbley, a true expert.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.800]  I mean, he, a year and a half ago, saw Obama coming.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.601]  He said, this is the anointed one.
[00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.961]  He's going to expand the wars.
[00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:27.061]  He is going to hire nothing but lobbyists.
[00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:29.202]  He is going to bring nothing but Wall Street in to loot everybody.
[00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:31.722]  And he said, they're going to implode the economy.
[00:15:31.802 --> 00:15:32.362]  Watch this.
[00:15:32.863 --> 00:15:34.763]  And then sure enough, he was right about all of it.
[00:15:35.563 --> 00:15:47.769]  The youth brigades, the force compulsory service, really a scholarly analysis of the entire Barack Obama phenomenon, who's there with left covered and neutralized the Democrats of the country.
[00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:53.632]  I saw a CNN poll Friday, 65% of Democrats think the war is going well and Obama's doing a good job.
[00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:56.654]  That goes from 80 plus percent of Democrats against the war under Bush
[00:15:57.327 --> 00:15:58.968]  To now 65% for it.
[00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:11.558]  That is a truly sickening example of mind control and of disgraceful psychological mindset because it's their guy who they feel like represents them and they feel like they won by getting him in the White House.
[00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:18.704]  They suddenly love secret arrest, renditions, no rights for detainees, warrantless NSA taps on people's phones.
[00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:21.987]  Uh, just absolute, you know, trillions to the banks.
[00:16:22.407 --> 00:16:24.930]  This AIG distraction of 165 million.
[00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.232]  Barack Obama, the worst president ever.
[00:16:27.513 --> 00:16:28.634]  Dwarfing George Bush.
[00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:30.576]  Webster Tarfully, straight ahead.
[00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:38.832]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:16:38.912 --> 00:16:40.592]  Genetically modifying.
[00:16:40.692 --> 00:16:42.873]  Mixing vegetables with animals.
[00:16:43.153 --> 00:16:45.974]  And now experimenting with viruses.
[00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:46.694]  Viruses.
[00:16:47.114 --> 00:16:52.395]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:54.916]  Starve or surrender.
[00:16:55.016 --> 00:16:55.596]  Surrender.
[00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:59.117]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:16:59.597 --> 00:17:00.497]  What then?
[00:17:03.217 --> 00:17:06.037]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:10.478]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.

[00:18:50.616 --> 00:18:53.198]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[00:18:53.478 --> 00:18:56.121]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:00.044]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.

[00:19:44.334 --> 00:19:45.394]  Garden in a Can.

[00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:48.954]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[00:20:49.474 --> 00:20:56.879]  That's right, we are shouting right back at the international bankers that the devil is in the details.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.322]  Thank you so much for joining us on this 29th day of March, 2009.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:16.884]  And we have with us in studio, historian, author, economist, Webster Griffin Tarbly, who wrote the unauthorized biography of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:21:16.924 --> 00:21:27.408]  He's written an unauthorized biography on Barack Obama and another book detailing Obama and the people that are really behind him, the thugs, the globalists, the international financiers imploding the world economy.
[00:21:28.268 --> 00:21:30.629]  And we've got the big G20 meeting coming up this week.
[00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:31.950]  If you watch the European Parliament,
[00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:46.370]  As I do, online, they're openly announcing a world government, a global Europe, a world currency, the end of national sovereignty, and these private banks ruling through NATO and the United States military force, the planet.
[00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:49.204]  Let me start, Alex, by congratulating you for the Obama deception.
[00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:49.724]  I think it's the best
[00:22:09.258 --> 00:22:11.239]  Political documentary in many decades.
[00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:34.010]  It's a masterpiece in a genre and I think it's destined to bring home some Rewards from international film festivals that you and your fine team have put together I recommend everybody get it because it's it's indispensable and I hope it's going to contribute to turning the tide in other words going towards a situation where Obama is not going to be the Messiah, but where he's got a essentially deal with the collapse of his poll numbers and
[00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:36.026]  To basically checkmate him, right?
[00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:38.287]  To stop him from doing all these things that he wants to do.
[00:22:38.347 --> 00:22:40.208]  Well, as you said, let's cover polls first, then.
[00:22:40.228 --> 00:22:44.471]  He's dropped from 85% to 55% to 60% in a month and a half.
[00:22:44.511 --> 00:22:44.751]  Go ahead.
[00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:44.911]  Right.
[00:22:44.971 --> 00:22:48.313]  Not only has he fallen in the polls, but the negatives have gone way up.
[00:22:48.373 --> 00:22:51.415]  And the negatives are always the key thing to watch, because once the negatives go up,
[00:22:51.895 --> 00:22:53.097]  Very hard to get them down again.
[00:23:10.917 --> 00:23:12.979]  Poor people or anything of the sort.
[00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:14.159]  That's all crazy.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:20.964]  Obama has delivered $10 trillion, maybe more, maybe $11 trillion, maybe $12 trillion.
[00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:21.544]  Hard to say.
[00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:24.106]  Federal Reserve is very secret about what they do.
[00:23:24.606 --> 00:23:28.769]  But he's delivering upwards of $10 trillion to bankers.
[00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:34.433]  And if you look through all of his programs compared to that, the amount of spending that actually would help anybody in terms of
[00:23:34.853 --> 00:23:38.995]  Food stamps, unemployment benefits, infrastructure building to create some jobs.
[00:23:39.556 --> 00:23:41.537]  It's maybe a third of a trillion.
[00:23:41.637 --> 00:23:44.878]  So it's about a 30 to 1 ratio.
[00:23:44.938 --> 00:23:48.340]  The bankers get 30 for every dollar that the rest of us get.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:56.344]  So the bankers get the lion's share, the Wall Street characters, the derivatives merchants, and the crumbs is what falls on the floor.
[00:23:56.525 --> 00:24:00.787]  And then we, the productive middle class, we get to pay for all of this.
[00:24:01.147 --> 00:24:07.689]  And then the bankers sit around with their neocon mouthpieces talking about how bad welfare is when it's $1 out of every $30.
[00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.351]  $30 goes in corporate banker welfare, $1 to the people.
[00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:28.237]  The middle class fits the bill, but the media has craftily maneuvered the middle class, some of them, to believe that they're actually with Obama against the lazy people that got bad mortgages when the Treasury Secretaries Geithner and the last one Paulson admit it has nothing to do with that, and that's why they didn't use the TARP money on that.
[00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:42.937]  The idea, if you listen to Rush Limbaugh or these other essentially pro-Wall Street characters, is they'll tell you that Obama is helping the deadbeats and the losers and the welchers of society, and he's robbing the achievers.
[00:24:42.997 --> 00:24:46.039]  Well, the deadbeats turn out to be those derivatives bankers.
[00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:47.660]  Now, you ask, who are they?
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:54.163]  We had an extraordinary event on Friday afternoon, which maybe can be the starting point for our conversation today.
[00:24:54.998 --> 00:25:04.062]  At the White House, Obama had a special meeting with about 15 representatives of what's today called the banking industry.
[00:25:04.082 --> 00:25:06.223]  It's really not an industry, it's really banking.
[00:25:06.803 --> 00:25:14.446]  But they were there, and you've got to think of this as Obama's the President of the United States, but he's meeting with the Board of Directors.
[00:25:15.407 --> 00:25:18.688]  The idea is that the United States is being made into a corporate state.
[00:25:19.358 --> 00:25:25.488]  In some ways similar to the Mussolini fascist corporate state of Italy in the 1920s, 1930s.
[00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:34.001]  And the board of directors comes to hear a report from the president and they know they made him, they can unmake him.
[00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:36.693]  These are the people who put Obama into office.
[00:25:37.193 --> 00:25:41.296]  Goldman Sachs gave Obama more money than any other single source.
[00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:43.417]  Citibank and others not far behind.
[00:25:43.437 --> 00:25:45.459]  In fact, total, four times what McCain got.
[00:25:45.859 --> 00:25:50.442]  Let me just go through this list and you'll hear the people who made Obama great.
[00:25:50.802 --> 00:25:53.784]  And again, once they're fed up with him, they can also get rid of him.
[00:25:54.285 --> 00:25:56.686]  Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase.
[00:25:56.746 --> 00:25:58.367]  That is one of the biggest zombie banks.
[00:25:58.507 --> 00:26:01.890]  It's a derivatives monster with hundreds of
[00:26:03.072 --> 00:26:07.457]  Billions and actually trillions of derivatives, just by itself.
[00:26:08.038 --> 00:26:10.701]  So, Diamond of JPMorgan Chase.
[00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:13.864]  We've got Ken Lewis of Bank of America.
[00:26:13.884 --> 00:26:15.846]  Now, this guy is an aggressive spokesman.
[00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:23.375]  He says, yeah, we're the bankers, we get the bonuses, and you're going to sit there and like it, and by the way, I want another 500 billion or whatever it is.
[00:26:24.306 --> 00:26:27.930]  Vikram Pandit, known in Wall Street circles as Pandit the Bandit.
[00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:40.404]  This is Citigroup, and Pandit, he's basically driven the stock of that company down to about a dollar a share, but they have been bailed out three times by the federal government to the tune of about 50 billion dollars.
[00:26:40.444 --> 00:26:42.527]  We've got John Stumpf of Wells Fargo.
[00:26:43.127 --> 00:26:45.048]  Ken Chenault of American Express.
[00:26:45.128 --> 00:26:51.229]  Now, Ken Chenault can borrow money for zero interest and then lend it to you for 25% interest on your credit card.
[00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.710]  And every time you turn around, he's going to hit you with a new fine.
[00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.751]  John Koskinen of Freddie Mac.
[00:26:55.791 --> 00:26:57.571]  Now, that used to be a federal government agency.
[00:26:57.611 --> 00:27:03.093]  It was privatized, made into this tremendous cornucopia of corruption and money.
[00:27:03.753 --> 00:27:07.655]  Ronald Logue of State Street Bank, Robert Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon.
[00:27:08.055 --> 00:27:16.018]  Bank of New York Mellon is the back office of the TARP, of the original October bailout, the $700 billion that is still being distributed.
[00:27:16.558 --> 00:27:18.119]  Rick Waddell of Northern Trust.
[00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:26.302]  Northern Trust is a bank that gave Obama a sweetheart mortgage for his resco lot there in Chicago.
[00:27:26.682 --> 00:27:29.803]  James Rohr of PNC Financial Services Group.
[00:27:30.442 --> 00:27:33.044]  Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs.
[00:27:33.104 --> 00:27:40.270]  Now, he deserves a special mention, of course, because Goldman Sachs is really one of the beneficiaries of this entire system.
[00:27:40.671 --> 00:27:42.953]  He was joined by John Mack of Morgan Stanley.
[00:27:43.373 --> 00:27:52.781]  If you put together Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Blankfein and Mack, you remember last summer, a year ago now, a year and a half ago, when you were paying
[00:27:53.504 --> 00:27:55.986]  About $4.50 to $5 a gallon for gas.
[00:27:56.026 --> 00:28:02.430]  My basic rough calculation is that out of the price of gasoline, Blankfein and Mack were getting about a dollar.
[00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:11.657]  So each of them was getting 50 cents, maybe a little bit more for Goldman Sachs, but a total of a dollar out of the price of every gallon of gas sold in the United States.
[00:28:11.677 --> 00:28:12.798]  Through their speculation.
[00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:19.622]  Yeah, to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, because they were using derivatives on the London ICE exchange to get the price of gasoline up.
[00:28:19.662 --> 00:28:21.224]  And they call this scamming free market.
[00:28:21.264 --> 00:28:22.925]  They're the ones giving the free market a bad name.
[00:28:23.505 --> 00:28:28.148]  The free market has not been seen on land or sea for many a day, and it's not going to be seen.
[00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:32.110]  If you say the free market, you're talking about this group of people.
[00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.890]  Pirates just running giant policy scams.
[00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:36.452]  If you deregulated everything... You're talking about Madoff running scams.
[00:28:36.492 --> 00:28:38.753]  Yeah, these are basically bigger versions of Madoff.
[00:28:38.773 --> 00:28:39.273]  It's all Madoff people.
[00:28:39.293 --> 00:28:40.494]  He ran the Nasdaq, founded it.
[00:28:40.934 --> 00:28:42.115]  Richard Davis of U.S.
[00:28:42.155 --> 00:28:43.236]  Bancorp, that's another one.
[00:28:43.536 --> 00:28:50.401]  Then a couple of sort of token people, Camden Fine of the Independent Community Bankers of America, that would be small, small regional banks.
[00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:52.242]  And there, of course, they're the lambs for the slaughter.
[00:28:52.643 --> 00:29:02.530]  The plan is that solvent local and regional banks are going to be fed into the voracious jaws of the sharks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
[00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.430]  Stay with us.

[00:32:33.383 --> 00:32:38.705]  With an economy that continues to plummet, many of us will have to make the difficult decision to cut back on our expenses.
[00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:42.006]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[00:32:42.466 --> 00:32:49.749]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, a weak immune system, or just always feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.

[00:33:10.913 --> 00:33:11.173]  I think so.
[00:33:35.951 --> 00:33:38.114]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:43.580]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.563]  There's a lot of confusion.
[00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:47.745]  The American people are angry.
[00:33:54.724 --> 00:34:02.406]  They're saying $165 million to AIG when we gave them $200-something billion, one company alone, of trillions and trillions.
[00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:08.288]  Imagine how mad they would be if they knew that that was all a diversion and a red herring and a distraction.
[00:34:08.308 --> 00:34:10.589]  So we're going to be talking about that as well, Webster Tarpley.
[00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:14.890]  Also, two bills last week had mandatory national service in them.
[00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.390]  That got stripped out.
[00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.531]  Another one's been introduced again.
[00:34:17.551 --> 00:34:18.471]  We're going to cover that later.
[00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:22.012]  Webster, you've gotten up to the 13 big zombie banks.
[00:34:22.052 --> 00:34:26.294]  That is the dead derivatives banks running global bubbles to buy up everything they create.
[00:34:26.374 --> 00:34:29.635]  Fiat, junk paper, buy real assets while it still has worth.
[00:34:29.975 --> 00:34:31.376]  The Ponzi scheme's now popped.
[00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:34.417]  They're telling the American taxpayer, you're going to be free market.
[00:34:34.757 --> 00:34:37.358]  You're going to give trillions of dollars in tax money to us.
[00:34:37.878 --> 00:34:40.599]  We've got the army standing by for martial law if you don't like it.
[00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.203]  And that's their quote, free market is basically robbing us at gunpoint.
[00:34:44.503 --> 00:34:48.868]  So continue, they march down to the White House ahead of the G20 coming up later this week.
[00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:57.658]  The first time a sitting president will go for an audience with the Queen of England ahead of that the day before he goes to Europe for that meeting.
[00:34:57.818 --> 00:34:58.579]  We'll get to that next.
[00:34:58.639 --> 00:34:59.340]  Right now, continue.
[00:35:00.034 --> 00:35:04.477]  Well, 13 zombie bankers meeting with Obama at the White House on Friday afternoon.
[00:35:04.497 --> 00:35:09.601]  And again, it's the board of directors receiving the report from the president, the guy they created.
[00:35:09.821 --> 00:35:22.271]  Again, Goldman Sachs with Blankfein, Mack of Morgan Stanley, Pandit of Citigroup, Lewis of Bank of America, and of course the dean of the bankers, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase.
[00:35:23.191 --> 00:35:31.337]  This is a discussion with Obama, and it shows, I think, this momentum towards what you can only call a corporate state, or indeed a fascist corporate state.
[00:35:32.477 --> 00:35:39.923]  When you have the government merging with the bankers and big business, that's not socialism, that's called fascism.
[00:35:40.023 --> 00:35:44.406]  That's what Mussolini did in Italy, and that was really imitative.
[00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:51.871]  Before you go any further, get into the fact that, and I'm not even saying we need socialism, but if we're going to have it, might as well give it to the people if we're paying for it,
[00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:56.882]  Time Magazine Newsweek, Newsweek with the headline, we're all socialists now.
[00:35:57.202 --> 00:36:00.523]  This is the opposite of that, but that's their little left cover scam.
[00:36:00.563 --> 00:36:01.003]  Explain that.
[00:36:01.123 --> 00:36:03.423]  Yeah, Obama can't survive without left cover.
[00:36:03.604 --> 00:36:11.085]  In other words, if Bush tried to do these things, or anybody else operating under this right-wing ideology, there would be essentially a social explosion.
[00:36:11.145 --> 00:36:18.907]  The reason that they think Obama can get away with it is, of course, he's the Messiah, he's got this utopian messianic overtone going,
[00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:21.162]  But of course, he's a progressive.
[00:36:21.542 --> 00:36:23.003]  He's got left cover, right?
[00:36:23.043 --> 00:36:24.363]  He does this stuff for the people.
[00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:26.944]  He's helping out the average working stiff.
[00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:28.464]  And of course, none of that, right?
[00:36:28.484 --> 00:36:30.184]  He's owned by these bankers.
[00:36:30.264 --> 00:36:31.425]  Socialism would be different.
[00:36:31.985 --> 00:36:38.226]  Socialism, rigorously defined, is the ownership of means of production by the government.
[00:36:38.266 --> 00:36:42.787]  Now, the problem with that in the United States is there's almost nothing left in the way of means of production, right?
[00:36:42.807 --> 00:36:46.908]  The automobile industry is collapsing, infrastructure collapsing, highways, railroads.
[00:36:47.328 --> 00:36:47.948]  All collapsing.
[00:36:47.988 --> 00:36:49.348]  Hard to find anything much to own.
[00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:55.810]  The other thing is that under socialism, this is somehow supposed to be done in the interests of the working class.
[00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.970]  And you don't see anything of that with Obama.
[00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.791]  So, this group of people gathers.
[00:37:00.831 --> 00:37:05.752]  Now, they're looking ahead to the group of 20, which meets in London on April 2nd, this coming week.
[00:37:06.132 --> 00:37:10.293]  But the other thing they're doing is they're looking back towards what Geithner proposed.
[00:37:10.393 --> 00:37:12.113]  Two big things from Geithner this week.
[00:37:12.553 --> 00:37:15.754]  The first from Geithner is the toxic assets.
[00:37:16.707 --> 00:37:20.529]  And the bad bank, or aggregator bank, that he's talked about.
[00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:23.051]  Now, what are toxic assets?
[00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.471]  We're in a depression.
[00:37:24.791 --> 00:37:26.092]  What's the cause of the depression?
[00:37:26.152 --> 00:37:27.393]  Well, toxic assets.
[00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:35.517]  Does that mean that some penny-ante, chicken-feed, peanuts, subprime mortgages brought down the entire world banking system?
[00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:36.718]  The idea is crazy.
[00:37:37.098 --> 00:37:38.759]  This is a derivatives crisis.
[00:37:38.819 --> 00:37:43.181]  There's a 1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble.
[00:37:43.201 --> 00:37:43.521]  1.5 or 1,500
[00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:50.987]  trillion dollars of derivatives out there in the world.
[00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:57.649]  And what they're trying to do, the whole US government is now being run to prop up that bubble, to keep it inflated, right?
[00:37:57.669 --> 00:37:58.830]  To keep it going.
[00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:08.953]  Now, Geithner says that he is going to put up six dollars of US government money from the Treasury for every dollar from a hedge fund or a bank.
[00:38:09.013 --> 00:38:13.054]  So, if I'm Goldman Sachs, and they're likely to be the first ones on this gravy train,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.446]  I can come with a billion dollars, and I'm Goldman Sachs, I can say, Geithner, here's my billion.
[00:38:18.906 --> 00:38:30.119]  Geithner is going to put down six billion, in other words, six to one leverage with the government, treasury, you and me, providing the money, and then buy up some toxic derivatives and keep them.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.522]  Suppose these things go to zero, because that's where they're likely to go, right?
[00:38:34.582 --> 00:38:38.604]  Derivatives, not only do they have no value, they have negative value.
[00:38:38.664 --> 00:38:42.746]  They're like the Rasputnik in the old Little Abner cartoon, right?
[00:38:42.866 --> 00:38:44.366]  It's a currency that has negative value.
[00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:46.487]  You've got to bring the garbageman to take it away.
[00:38:46.547 --> 00:38:49.309]  So, toxic assets are of that sort.
[00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:51.570]  So, if it goes to zero, who loses money?
[00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.571]  The taxpayer loses six times the amount that Goldman Sachs will lose.
[00:38:55.971 --> 00:39:00.733]  But if there's an upside, suppose these derivatives for some reason go up, who gets the upside?
[00:39:01.153 --> 00:39:02.853]  Goldman Sachs gets the upside.
[00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:05.174]  So this is basically putting the U.S.
[00:39:05.214 --> 00:39:11.936]  government into the hedge fund business with managers who are undoubtedly going to be Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[00:39:13.563 --> 00:39:14.363]  Morgan Stanley.
[00:39:14.503 --> 00:39:15.544]  The people that got us into this.
[00:39:15.564 --> 00:39:17.346]  Yeah, the people who created the crisis.
[00:39:17.666 --> 00:39:18.887]  AIG, don't forget them.
[00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:28.054]  The AIG financial products hedge fund of London, England, created by itself, one hedge fund, three trillion dollars of derivatives.
[00:39:28.094 --> 00:39:30.015]  Now, three trillion is a hefty sum.
[00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:32.317]  That's more than the gross national product of France.
[00:39:32.697 --> 00:39:34.199]  So, they're up there with three trillion.
[00:39:34.499 --> 00:39:35.900]  That's where your money went, by the way.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.282]  Everybody's screaming about the 165 million, million with an M,
[00:39:40.183 --> 00:39:43.485]  of bonuses for these hedge fund hyenas from AIG.
[00:39:43.845 --> 00:39:48.947]  And of course, you deserve to be indignant about that, but you've got to be more indignant about the fact that the U.S.
[00:39:49.007 --> 00:39:54.870]  government has given $165 billion to AIG to unwind those derivatives.
[00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:59.633]  Now, the really interesting thing is, who got the $165 billion, right?
[00:39:59.913 --> 00:40:02.154]  For quite a while, Bernanke was saying, I won't tell you.
[00:40:02.514 --> 00:40:06.116]  Bernanke's number two guy, this guy Cohn at the Federal Reserve, saying, I won't tell you.
[00:40:06.496 --> 00:40:07.218]  Josh Curry wouldn't touch.
[00:40:07.278 --> 00:40:09.143]  Josh Curry, my lips are sealed.
[00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:11.910]  So, uh, and he's from Goldman Sachs, of course.
[00:40:12.518 --> 00:40:13.319]  So who got the money?
[00:40:13.419 --> 00:40:14.179]  Goldman Sachs!
[00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:21.425]  In other words, Kashkari basically put his hand into the taxpayer till and transferred about $12 billion to Goldman Sachs.
[00:40:21.505 --> 00:40:23.146]  And then, foreign banks.
[00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:28.210]  Barclays Bank of Britain, Societe Generale of France, and Deutsche Bank of Germany.
[00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:36.396]  Now, if those banks were so important, why didn't Gordon Brown of England, Sarkozy of France, and Merkel of Germany, why didn't they bail out their own banks?
[00:40:36.476 --> 00:40:37.197]  Why does the U.S.
[00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:38.798]  taxpayer have to pay for that?
[00:40:38.818 --> 00:40:40.079]  But that's what you get with Obama.
[00:40:40.499 --> 00:40:41.460]  Now that's one side of it.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:49.945]  The other side with Obama is that Geithner at the Treasury says he wants to be able to seize any bank and indeed any company.
[00:40:50.265 --> 00:40:51.165]  Why does he want to do that?
[00:40:51.405 --> 00:40:52.166]  Let's look what they did.
[00:40:52.816 --> 00:40:54.638]  There's this bank called Washington Mutual.
[00:40:54.698 --> 00:40:55.078]  Wham-oo.
[00:40:55.178 --> 00:40:57.200]  It was the largest savings bank in the U.S.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.581]  A very large deposit base.
[00:40:58.921 --> 00:41:01.404]  As far as I can see, it was, on the whole, solvent.
[00:41:01.564 --> 00:41:03.966]  So they're gobbling up all the healthy regional banks.
[00:41:04.166 --> 00:41:07.629]  What they did with that was, Sheila Baer, and Sheila Baer is a criminal.
[00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:11.353]  She's a Class A felon at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
[00:41:11.373 --> 00:41:13.835]  She said, I'm going to take Washington Mutual
[00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:14.475]  Yes.
[00:41:33.582 --> 00:41:46.574]  And with the link between JPMorgan Goldman Sachs and Geithner and Obama, you would have a fully developed, full-blown fascist corporate state where the government and the banks would merge and become the same thing.
[00:41:46.994 --> 00:41:48.956]  And it's all done under left cover.
[00:41:49.296 --> 00:41:52.659]  Smoke and mirrors, but Obama has left cover.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.441]  And that, I think, suggests the way to stop this stuff.
[00:41:55.741 --> 00:41:58.562]  If you want to stop Obama, strip away the left cover.
[00:41:58.662 --> 00:42:00.742]  It means, among other things, you've got to attack him from the left.
[00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:03.263]  Don't say he's a socialist who's helping the poor.
[00:42:03.723 --> 00:42:21.689]  Say that he's a tool of Wall Street and the big banks, who is basically robbing the Treasury and mobilizing the Federal Reserve to give that 10 or 12 trillion, or whatever it's going to be, 12, maybe 12 trillion and counting by now, to his friends in Wall Street, who are also his contributors from AIG to Goldman Sachs and so on.
[00:42:21.809 --> 00:42:36.241]  Now Webster, I want to move on to the G20 meeting because they're openly announcing a world government run by these private banks that's already issuing a secret global super currency of monetized pyramid debt that, again, we as taxpayers have to pay for.
[00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:39.484]  So this is open world government, as Time Magazine has said, but they say it's the solution.
[00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.425]  Yeah, and of course, global warming.
[00:43:06.815 --> 00:43:07.495]  Ironic, right?
[00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:18.102]  There's snow in the streets of Chicago and it's the last weekend in March, but nevertheless, we're told that humanity has to be crucified in order to stop global warming.
[00:43:18.122 --> 00:43:24.385]  This is the biggest fraud to come down the pike since race science or Aryan blood back in the 1930s.
[00:43:24.445 --> 00:43:25.026]  All right, stay there.
[00:43:25.046 --> 00:43:25.546]  We've got a break.
[00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:26.266]  We're going to come back.
[00:43:26.606 --> 00:43:27.527]  What is the G20?
[00:43:27.587 --> 00:43:30.829]  Why are they saying this is the birth of world government, of and by the bankers?
[00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:32.010]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.430]  Stay with us.
[00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:36.677]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[00:43:37.037 --> 00:43:41.059]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.402]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[00:43:45.802 --> 00:43:47.704]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[00:43:47.984 --> 00:43:52.447]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[00:43:52.787 --> 00:43:59.071]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[00:43:59.671 --> 00:44:00.872]  One Florida customer says,
[00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:09.399]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.084]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:44:14.604 --> 00:44:17.487]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.

[00:44:33.228 --> 00:44:41.337]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:44:41.498 --> 00:44:45.883]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:44:46.063 --> 00:44:50.568]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:44:50.728 --> 00:44:52.150]  It's a documented fact.
[00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:59.592]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:44:59.772 --> 00:45:11.594]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:38.826]  Cliff, have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:45:39.126 --> 00:45:47.412]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:45:47.692 --> 00:45:50.975]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:45:51.255 --> 00:45:54.157]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:45:54.477 --> 00:45:56.579]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[00:46:37.137 --> 00:46:43.123]  Would you like to be out of debt in just 90 days using a system with proven and guaranteed results for over 15 years?
[00:46:43.584 --> 00:46:48.729]  Would you like to stop any mortgage foreclosure and have a written guarantee that would make most attorneys scream?
[00:46:48.749 --> 00:46:53.234]  Hi, I'm John Glia, the author of Winning the Collection Game and founder of Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[00:46:53.534 --> 00:46:56.777]  My zero debt expert system has helped tens of thousands of people.
[00:46:57.398 --> 00:46:59.560]  She wasn't really skeptical, but she liked your written guarantees.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.341]  And I'm glad we went with the program.
[00:47:01.581 --> 00:47:05.985]  Thanks to your system, John, we've got a fresh start and are debt-free, and it only took a few months.
[00:47:06.205 --> 00:47:09.208]  And you don't need an attorney to get the benefits of my proven system.

[00:47:45.482 --> 00:47:46.844]  I know we have a load of phone lines.
[00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:49.006]  Your calls are coming up the next hour with Webster Tarpley.
[00:47:49.026 --> 00:47:52.589]  We are live 29th of March 2009 on the Sunday edition.
[00:47:52.649 --> 00:47:58.895]  If you appreciate the information we put out here, don't forget we post it as a podcast for every show six days a week at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:58.955 --> 00:48:02.418]  Absolutely free there at InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com.
[00:48:02.798 --> 00:48:05.200]  Okay, Webster, your quick answer, because there's a lot to cover here.
[00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:07.603]  When they're announcing
[00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:16.634]  That they're gonna have a new Bank of the World that we pay our carbon taxes to, and I have that again here today out of Reuters.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.001]  And they say it's a climate deal for tax.
[00:48:20.241 --> 00:48:26.263]  I have another article that I gave you where they announce that it's going to cost trillions a year to quote, reform the new green economy.
[00:48:26.683 --> 00:48:31.665]  They laugh, they know it's a huge scam to literally tax the entire carbon cycle.
[00:48:32.045 --> 00:48:40.508]  So tell us what's going on at the G20 and then why is Obama, for the first president ever, stopping first for an audience being summoned by the Queen?
[00:48:41.161 --> 00:48:45.584]  Well, London is reasserting itself as the actual financial center of the world, right?
[00:48:45.644 --> 00:48:46.725]  New York is collapsing.
[00:48:46.965 --> 00:48:48.606]  London, they think, is going to hang on.
[00:48:48.966 --> 00:48:53.269]  They think the euro will go down, the US will go down, and the British will come out on top.
[00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:56.532]  Therefore, Obama has to kowtow to the Queen of England.
[00:48:56.552 --> 00:48:58.273]  Now, you look at this group of 20.
[00:48:58.353 --> 00:49:01.335]  This is basically the old group of eight, right?
[00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:04.057]  It's Europe, Japan, United States, Canada.
[00:49:04.437 --> 00:49:06.538]  But now we've got other big third world countries.
[00:49:06.638 --> 00:49:10.221]  China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, places like this.
[00:49:11.307 --> 00:49:16.550]  It represents about 90% of the world in terms of economic activity, and a large part of the population.
[00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:27.055]  Now, the dominant personality is Gordon Brown of Great Britain, joined by Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mervyn King of the Bank of England.
[00:49:27.075 --> 00:49:33.639]  The basic idea is to assert a world currency dictatorship, a world financial dictatorship,
[00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:34.439]  We're good to go.
[00:49:53.746 --> 00:50:01.748]  Well, what they want you to do is privatize, deregulate, bust unions, lower the standard of living, destroy your labor legislation, destroy your child labor laws.
[00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:14.952]  All the rest of this stuff.
[00:50:14.992 --> 00:50:17.233]  Used to be called the Washington Consensus.
[00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:19.594]  But now it's got to be austerity.
[00:50:19.654 --> 00:50:20.534]  Super austerity.
[00:50:20.615 --> 00:50:23.876]  And naturally, they want to motivate this with the polar bears, right?
[00:50:23.956 --> 00:50:25.217]  Your kid is going to starve.
[00:50:25.797 --> 00:50:26.458]  No health care.
[00:50:26.838 --> 00:50:27.998]  But you can be comforted.
[00:50:28.098 --> 00:50:30.920]  It's all being done to stop global warming and help the polar bears.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.583]  Now, the leading edge is Gordon Brown, when he came here to Washington, demanded $500 billion for the IMF.
[00:50:37.724 --> 00:50:39.825]  And out of that $500 billion, the U.S.
[00:50:39.845 --> 00:50:41.966]  was supposed to cough up $100 billion.
[00:50:42.026 --> 00:50:42.346]  Think of it.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:43.980]  Food stamps.
[00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.262]  We got 20 billion more on food stamps in the stimulus.
[00:50:47.943 --> 00:50:49.664]  Even though one-tenth of the U.S.
[00:50:49.704 --> 00:50:53.806]  population is on food stamps, three million people in Texas live on food stamps.
[00:50:54.527 --> 00:50:57.569]  One out of every eight people in Michigan lives on food stamps.
[00:50:58.009 --> 00:50:59.590]  We could manage 20 billion for that.
[00:51:00.618 --> 00:51:02.400]  But a hundred billion from the U.S.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.222]  for the International Monetary Fund.
[00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:12.249]  The other dimension that you talk about, this world currency, it is this paper derivative, because that's the only thing you can call it.
[00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:15.232]  Special Drawing Rights, SDRs.
[00:51:15.432 --> 00:51:17.534]  It started back in the 1970s.
[00:51:17.934 --> 00:51:20.917]  It's a basket of currencies, and they want to have more of these.
[00:51:20.957 --> 00:51:21.898]  Now the idea then is,
[00:51:22.711 --> 00:51:22.912]  Yes.
[00:51:35.672 --> 00:51:42.374]  The printing press at the IMF turning out more and more trillion-dollar certificates of special drawing rights.
[00:51:42.414 --> 00:51:51.478]  So, with that, they think that they can control the world, essentially buy up any assets they want, feed it into these zombie banks, keep the derivatives going, and so forth.
[00:51:51.738 --> 00:51:54.779]  Let me hasten to say, though, this is crazy.
[00:51:54.939 --> 00:51:55.719]  This won't work.
[00:51:55.819 --> 00:51:57.320]  They're headed for the biggest panic
[00:51:57.975 --> 00:51:59.336]  The biggest disintegration.
[00:51:59.356 --> 00:52:01.397]  This is a bottomless depression.
[00:52:01.717 --> 00:52:02.858]  There is no recovery.
[00:52:03.158 --> 00:52:05.399]  There's nothing automatic that's going to cause a recovery.
[00:52:05.419 --> 00:52:09.962]  The recovery will come when these lunatic policies are reversed.
[00:52:10.002 --> 00:52:11.303]  Now, the other things they want to do.
[00:52:11.883 --> 00:52:13.004]  No protectionism.
[00:52:13.164 --> 00:52:16.626]  That means, suppose we get a dollar panic.
[00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.702]  And everybody wants to flee the dollar.
[00:52:19.742 --> 00:52:24.083]  We would then need something like exchange controls and capital controls to save the dollar.
[00:52:24.503 --> 00:52:26.004]  They'd say, no, you can't do that.
[00:52:26.424 --> 00:52:31.926]  How about a modest protective tariff to protect re-industrialization here in the U.S.?
[00:52:31.946 --> 00:52:36.907]  Because if we can't use the dollar to buy things automatically, we're going to have to manufacture here.
[00:52:37.248 --> 00:52:39.088]  And they'd say, no, you can't protect yourself.
[00:52:39.408 --> 00:52:40.749]  Everybody's got to be free to dump.
[00:52:40.989 --> 00:52:41.909]  So we don't want you to do that.
[00:52:41.929 --> 00:52:42.749]  Look at Obama.
[00:52:42.989 --> 00:52:44.350]  Look at Obama with the stimulus.
[00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:49.512]  787 million, and they said, you know what, we've got to buy all the goods from China and other countries.
[00:52:49.773 --> 00:52:53.394]  We're not allowed to buy American under World Trade Organization agreements.
[00:52:53.454 --> 00:52:54.755]  Congress has given up its authority.
[00:52:55.115 --> 00:52:59.637]  Meanwhile, China, with its near-slave labor, that's a built-in tariff and with their low currency.
[00:52:59.657 --> 00:53:04.000]  So this is designed to de-industrialize us and feed the real economy into Wall Street.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:10.123]  And that was when Tony Blair, when Gordon Brown came and gave his address to the Joint Session of Congress, because that's what he did.
[00:53:10.463 --> 00:53:12.244]  The big thing was, no protectionism means
[00:53:13.084 --> 00:53:16.345]  You can't defend yourself in any way from these things that I'm doing.
[00:53:16.385 --> 00:53:18.886]  The other thing is this global regulator.
[00:53:18.946 --> 00:53:21.828]  The idea is they want to have a bubble economy.
[00:53:21.888 --> 00:53:23.428]  They want to have a casino economy.
[00:53:23.468 --> 00:53:24.609]  They want to have more derivatives.
[00:53:25.009 --> 00:53:29.030]  But they want it to be a heroin addict with no side effects.
[00:53:29.511 --> 00:53:31.672]  To be a drunk and never have a hangover.
[00:53:31.692 --> 00:53:39.755]  In other words, keep this paper-based, derivatives-based, hedge fund-based, casino, bloated, fictitious, cancerous system.
[00:53:40.734 --> 00:53:41.454]  None of the defects.
[00:53:41.474 --> 00:53:43.035]  So we have to have global risk management.
[00:53:43.055 --> 00:53:51.440]  And they're saying they're gonna, Wall Street Journal reported, they're gutting the old IRS tax system and getting rid of the home mortgage exemption.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.402]  So he lied when he said only people $125,000 or more.
[00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:57.383]  You know, that's a spin when he says $250,000.
[00:53:57.763 --> 00:54:01.065]  That's two people together in a household.
[00:54:01.345 --> 00:54:02.146]  So it's a lie.
[00:54:02.186 --> 00:54:05.308]  It's not just people making $125,000 a year or more.
[00:54:05.588 --> 00:54:06.808]  They've now analyzed it.
[00:54:06.888 --> 00:54:07.789]  It is basically
[00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:11.433]  I think you have to pose the question from the point of view of class consciousness.
[00:54:11.453 --> 00:54:14.056]  In other words, an awareness of what are the groups in society.
[00:54:14.277 --> 00:54:14.957]  That's all it means.
[00:54:29.963 --> 00:54:31.304]  Who should pay for this depression?
[00:54:31.424 --> 00:54:33.825]  This depression is going to cost several quadrillion dollars.
[00:54:33.845 --> 00:54:34.365]  Who should pay?
[00:54:34.645 --> 00:54:37.246]  Should the American people pay through the system that you just described?
[00:54:37.686 --> 00:54:38.807]  I would propose something else.
[00:54:39.487 --> 00:54:42.829]  I put out a statement to the group of 20, which goes like this.
[00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:55.434]  If you want to have an economic recovery, the first thing you have to do is take that 1.5 quadrillion, that is 1,500 trillion, of derivatives, which are toxic with negative value, wipe them out.
[00:54:55.715 --> 00:54:57.235]  Shred them and delete them.
[00:54:57.295 --> 00:54:58.896]  The Madoff money bomb.
[00:54:59.256 --> 00:55:02.059]  Yeah, the AIG bomb.
[00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:04.522]  They created 3 trillion out of the 1,500 trillion.
[00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:07.205]  The point is, they're a criminal class of Madoffs.
[00:55:07.245 --> 00:55:10.328]  Yeah, and they're creating... It's the problem of fictitious capitalisms.
[00:55:10.368 --> 00:55:14.573]  You're creating things that are paper instruments outside of production against production.
[00:55:14.733 --> 00:55:41.800]  But they love that, that's why they wage war with their phony environmentalism against production because this is literally a group of charlatans or magicians that create Ponzi schemes and then have world armies and world laws and world regulators to back up their fraud as they wage war and they admit they want a post-industrial society because any real industry or jobs competes with them and means the people are sovereign and aren't institutionalized dependent on their world monopoly of currency and credit.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.802]  Right, so I say, wipe them out.
[00:55:43.943 --> 00:55:46.205]  In other words, there's only one thing to do with derivatives, right?
[00:55:46.245 --> 00:55:47.167]  Shred them, delete them.
[00:55:47.527 --> 00:55:48.709]  You can use them for wallpaper.
[00:55:48.749 --> 00:55:50.070]  You can use them for wrapping fish.
[00:55:50.411 --> 00:55:52.373]  You can use them for birdcage liner.
[00:55:52.694 --> 00:55:54.175]  Lots of good things to do with derivatives.
[00:55:54.215 --> 00:55:56.258]  Now, somebody might say, how dare you?
[00:55:56.438 --> 00:56:00.563]  How dare you attack the validity of contracts and the sanctity of derivatives?
[00:56:01.641 --> 00:56:03.843]  Take Herbert Hoover, of all people, right?
[00:56:03.863 --> 00:56:07.805]  Herbert Hoover, the most hidebound, the most impotent when it came to dealing with the Depression.
[00:56:08.166 --> 00:56:13.469]  He recognized in 1931, he said, look, you know, there are these reparations payments and these war debts.
[00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:19.473]  There's this huge mass of debt sitting in the middle of the world system that's crushing production and employment.
[00:56:19.774 --> 00:56:25.377]  If we want to get out of this Depression, we better at least freeze all payments on those reparations.
[00:56:25.458 --> 00:56:25.858]  And he did!
[00:56:26.358 --> 00:56:29.620]  That's the famous Hoover Moratorium of 1931 to 1932.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:39.346]  It should have been made permanent, but the problem was that the conference that was held at Lausanne in Switzerland in 1932, to do something about this, punted.
[00:56:39.707 --> 00:56:47.372]  They did not take any effective action, and by January 1933, Hitler seizes power and you're on the skids towards World War II.
[00:56:48.232 --> 00:56:53.916]  Think about it, you people at the G20, and make sure your congressmen and senators know that you're thinking about this too.
[00:56:54.376 --> 00:57:01.681]  The only thing that that G20 needs to do, in terms of clearing the decks for recovery, wipe out those derivatives.
[00:57:01.981 --> 00:57:07.544]  Don't find ways to manage them, make them better, neutralize them, sanitize them, no.
[00:57:07.964 --> 00:57:08.685]  Wipe them out.
[00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:10.642]  It's like a black hole, right?
[00:57:10.862 --> 00:57:12.003]  1.5 quadrillion in derivatives.
[00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:15.065]  Doesn't matter what you put into it, it's still a black hole.
[00:57:15.185 --> 00:57:16.986]  It's still gonna eat the world.
[00:57:17.126 --> 00:57:18.867]  So the only thing to do is to get rid of it.
[00:57:18.887 --> 00:57:27.473]  Well, it's admitted that the big central banks and brokerage houses have been taking a lot of the bailout money and leveraging it again with naked shorts and other derivatives because they can't help it.
[00:57:28.073 --> 00:57:38.617]  You know, they get all the money and bonuses when the Ponzi scheme still has value in people's eyes, and then they hand us the Ponzi scheme once it collapses.
[00:57:39.197 --> 00:57:42.198]  So usually a Ponzi scam artist runs off with the money.
[00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:51.221]  Instead, they're standing up there with NORTHCOM and the military, saying, we're going to do this, and if you don't like it, we'll declare martial law, like they told Congress on October 3rd if they didn't pass that.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:56.322]  Now, one of the great inventors, really, of the modern derivative is this guy Scholz, right?
[00:57:56.342 --> 00:57:58.823]  He developed the Black-Scholz model of valuing derivatives.
[00:57:59.303 --> 00:58:10.388]  And he said recently, in the presence of Paul Volcker at a conference in New York City, he said, you know, the current existing mass of derivatives ought to be torn up, burned out, gotten rid of.
[00:58:10.548 --> 00:58:11.229]  I would agree with that.
[00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:16.091]  Senator Warner of Virginia in the Senate, in hearings a couple of weeks ago, asked Bernanke
[00:58:16.651 --> 00:58:21.633]  Don't you think there should be a bright line prohibition of credit default swaps?
[00:58:21.673 --> 00:58:22.533]  Now those are derivatives.
[00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:23.494]  Let me just tell you.
[00:58:23.514 --> 00:58:27.335]  The IRS is skimming the wealth of the American people for the Wall Street bankers.
[00:58:27.415 --> 00:58:31.297]  Taxpayers are being raked over the coals and forced to pay for bailout after bailout.
[00:58:31.417 --> 00:58:34.458]  First we went after the Fed, now we're going after the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:37.039]  On April 15th, the Republic strikes back.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.081]  We're good to go.
[00:58:53.783 --> 00:59:03.070]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:10.055]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:14.098]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[01:01:06.836 --> 01:01:12.625]  Separately, officials are searching for 11 police officers abducted near a major US military supply route.
[01:01:13.024 --> 01:01:19.890]  The Space Shuttle Discovery landed safely at Cape Canaveral in Florida Saturday after a 13-day mission to the International Space Station.
[01:01:20.311 --> 01:01:24.334]  An earlier landing time was cancelled due to thick clouds and strong winds in the area.
[01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:31.241]  Mission managers later said the clouds had broken up enough and winds had shifted, making it possible to safely land Discovery.
[01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:33.423]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:01:34.773 --> 01:01:37.857]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[01:01:38.158 --> 01:01:39.700]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.983]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods, and processed foods.
[01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:44.567]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[01:01:44.787 --> 01:01:46.709]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today?
[01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:48.051]  Or do you have this bloated feeling?
[01:01:48.212 --> 01:01:51.256]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[01:01:51.476 --> 01:01:54.197]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.
[01:01:54.457 --> 01:02:03.920]  It's called EverCleanse, a clinically proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you lose weight and get rid of the 5 to 25 pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.241]  Two weeks of EverCleanse may be equal to months of dieting.
[01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:07.081]  It's simple, too.
[01:02:07.361 --> 01:02:09.662]  Natural, tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage.

[01:02:46.747 --> 01:02:54.192]  Several law enforcement agencies, including Carthage and Whispering Pines Police, the Moore County Sheriff's Office, all at the scene now.
[01:02:54.352 --> 01:02:59.599]  Chase says police report two other people, including the suspect, have also been injured at the Carthage facility.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.022]  She says shots were fired around 10 a.m.

[01:04:04.651 --> 01:04:11.335]  President Obama says more needs to be done by General Motors and Chrysler to become more, quote, lean, mean, and competitive.
[01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:19.420]  Speaking to CBS Face the Nation, Obama would not give specifics on what he will announce Monday concerning more government help for the automakers.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.641]  They're not quite there yet.
[01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:29.566]  There's been some serious efforts to deal with a combination of long-standing problems in the auto industry and
[01:04:30.405 --> 01:04:31.226]  The current crisis.
[01:04:31.466 --> 01:04:37.511]  The two companies have received $17.4 billion to date and have asked for another $22 billion.
[01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:46.338]  Obama said what will be needed is, quote, a set of sacrifices from all parties involved, management, labor, shareholders, creditors, suppliers, and dealers.
[01:04:46.718 --> 01:04:55.585]  GM and Chrysler have renegotiated contracts with the United Auto Workers Union to reduce hourly wages to bring them close to those paid by Japanese companies in the U.S.

[01:05:33.678 --> 01:05:34.859]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:37.321]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:05:37.461 --> 01:05:41.443]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:05:41.623 --> 01:05:45.306]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:05:45.386 --> 01:05:53.872]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:05:53.952 --> 01:05:57.574]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:05:57.794 --> 01:06:03.558]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:06:04.138 --> 01:06:07.541]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:06:07.741 --> 01:06:11.943]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.

[01:06:43.877 --> 01:06:45.237]  He stands for truth.
[01:06:46.638 --> 01:06:48.478]  He stands for justice.
[01:06:49.859 --> 01:06:52.220]  He stands for what's right.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.621]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:06:58.903 --> 01:07:15.954]  Alright, when we start the next segment I'll go directly to your calls from around the country and the world.
[01:07:15.974 --> 01:07:19.416]  I want to make this clear to everybody out there.
[01:07:21.326 --> 01:07:25.507]  Private banks have already engaged in fractional reserve banking for hundreds of years.
[01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:29.548]  For every dollar they have, on average, they loan out $10 of fiat, imaginary debt.
[01:07:29.848 --> 01:07:31.548]  Then they get real assets when you default.
[01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:32.548]  They want you to default.
[01:07:32.828 --> 01:07:34.349]  They want third world countries to default.
[01:07:34.389 --> 01:07:38.410]  They do this over and over again throughout modern history and ancient history.
[01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:42.631]  Now they've created a whole other level of fractional reserve banking.
[01:07:42.651 --> 01:07:43.331]  These derivatives.
[01:07:43.411 --> 01:07:44.551]  Total made up crap.
[01:07:45.111 --> 01:07:54.395]  That they then leverage to the sun, more than all the wealth in the world, many times over, and they buy up real assets through that fiat value, through that made-up Ponzi value.
[01:07:55.235 --> 01:08:03.478]  Now, they are bankrupting the world by design, where they'll be the only creditors of choice when they engineered the thing with this tsunami of liquid cash.
[01:08:04.178 --> 01:08:05.499]  That's what's going on right now.
[01:08:05.539 --> 01:08:13.642]  They're openly all over British and European news, and even some US news, admitting what I've been telling you for 14 years on air, what Webster's been talking about for decades.
[01:08:14.528 --> 01:08:15.028]  This is it.
[01:08:15.769 --> 01:08:20.910]  They should all be going to jail, not opening up a world government they run.
[01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:32.895]  But this is the culmination of all their work, and it's only going to get worse from here until you wake up to the Republicans aren't going to save you, the Democrats aren't going to save you, they own both parties, they play the left-right paradigm off against each other.
[01:08:33.195 --> 01:08:37.737]  Webster Tarbley, I want to go to calls and then later get into solutions, but G20, what's coming up?
[01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.057]  Obama going to the Queen?
[01:08:39.397 --> 01:08:40.198]  What's really happening?
[01:08:41.198 --> 01:08:43.199]  Well, it's a world financial dictatorship.
[01:08:44.624 --> 01:09:01.530]  500 billion for the IMF, hyperinflation of SDRs, a world dictatorship of regulation which will be how to keep derivatives going at the expense of everything else, and no protectionism, and really no national sovereignty.
[01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:02.410]  So it's going to be a
[01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:04.014]  A disaster.
[01:09:04.234 --> 01:09:17.338]  And they've ordered hundreds of third world countries, they've blown out by design, we have their own documents, to do this, like Argentina and others, and every time they follow the orders, things only get worse, and worse, and worse, but the bankers consolidate the wealth.
[01:09:17.358 --> 01:09:18.339]  I mean, I want to explain that.
[01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:19.839]  There may well be resistance.
[01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:26.401]  I think, realistically, the Obama regime thought that they could get Europe to cough up more troops and money
[01:09:27.352 --> 01:09:27.592]  I think?
[01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:53.933]  And there also may be resistance coming from who knows who, maybe from Russia, maybe from China, and I think all of that is welcome.
[01:09:54.493 --> 01:10:00.236]  Anybody who stops Obama and Gordon Brown from implementing this plan, I think, is doing the rest of us a favor.
[01:10:00.256 --> 01:10:04.018]  Yeah, let's be clear, they always make it black and white, like America's the good guys, these are the bad guys.
[01:10:04.058 --> 01:10:07.599]  No, America has been seized by a group of corrupt bankers.
[01:10:07.619 --> 01:10:08.320]  Correct, Webster?
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:08.900]  Absolutely.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:16.984]  So, the City of London, in this process, they've got their operation going, they would like to re-emerge, but basically, Wall Street and the City of London are trying to
[01:10:17.564 --> 01:10:24.947]  Reassert this dollar dictatorship over the world and I don't think it's going to work because certainly there's an absolute physical certitude.
[01:10:25.427 --> 01:10:28.928]  The 1.5 quadrillion dollar derivative bubble cannot be bailed out.
[01:10:28.968 --> 01:10:31.009]  There is no power in the universe.
[01:10:31.049 --> 01:10:36.070]  There's not enough wealth in the entire solar system, right?
[01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:42.012]  It's 1,500 trillion compared to a world gross domestic product of about 50 trillion.
[01:10:42.032 --> 01:10:42.752]  So do the math.
[01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:43.152]  What is it?
[01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:43.473]  200 times
[01:10:45.486 --> 01:10:45.766]  Whatever.
[01:10:45.946 --> 01:10:46.927]  You got your calculator.
[01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:49.989]  It's hundreds of times the world domestic product.
[01:10:50.029 --> 01:10:50.909]  So, impossible.
[01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:51.630]  Can't be done.
[01:10:52.150 --> 01:11:12.062]  I mean, if Madoff would have just put out a check saying he had 50 trillion, 6 billion trillion, infinity trillion, would we just honor that check and then give him our houses and our children and our labor and just say, you're a banker, you made all this fiat stuff up, we love you, we worship you.
[01:11:12.816 --> 01:11:13.417]  It's impossible.
[01:11:13.497 --> 01:11:17.805]  And of course, it means, among other things, the destruction of world civilization.
[01:11:17.845 --> 01:11:22.372]  But I think before we get to that, we're going to get into this phase of dollar hyperinflation.
[01:11:23.394 --> 01:11:25.257]  The whole system remains based on the dollar.
[01:11:27.563 --> 01:11:32.965]  With the dollar being what it is, we've got this injection of 10 trillion, 12 trillion in the banks.
[01:11:33.425 --> 01:11:41.447]  Just about 10 days ago, Bernanke injected 1 trillion dollars of new liquidity into the banking system in one day.
[01:11:41.827 --> 01:11:48.429]  They do this by open market operations, in other words, by buying treasury securities so that securities come in and the cash goes out.
[01:11:48.469 --> 01:11:51.230]  Now, that was the biggest dive by the U.S.
[01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.350]  dollar in 25 years since 1984-1985.
[01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:53.330]  It was the biggest dive
[01:11:56.774 --> 01:11:58.075]  In recent history of U.S.
[01:11:58.115 --> 01:12:04.477]  Treasury security, so the tremors of hyperinflation and the panic to get out of the dollar are already coming.
[01:12:04.497 --> 01:12:12.821]  Yeah, but for people that aren't a top-degree economist like yourself, top of your class, Webster, for folks that don't understand, monetizing debt, explain what that means.
[01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:16.802]  The private Federal Reserve bought from the Treasury, backed up with U.S.
[01:12:16.842 --> 01:12:18.603]  taxpayer money, its own debt.
[01:12:19.136 --> 01:12:19.637]  Yeah.
[01:12:19.677 --> 01:12:20.838]  Treasury securities, right?
[01:12:20.918 --> 01:12:21.979]  They're issued by the Treasury.
[01:12:22.079 --> 01:12:22.299]  U.S.
[01:12:22.319 --> 01:12:24.001]  government obligations.
[01:12:24.061 --> 01:12:35.852]  The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, which is made up precisely of these unelected, unaccountable, illegal bankers from the regional Federal Reserve parts that have never been approved by the Senate.
[01:12:35.872 --> 01:12:37.614]  They've never gone through any kind of federal vetting.
[01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.255]  They're just local
[01:12:38.795 --> 01:12:39.255]  We're good to go.
[01:13:00.945 --> 01:13:11.653]  The nightmare of Paul Adolph Volcker, you'll remember him, he ran Carter's economic policy, 22% prime rate, got the interest rates on credit cards up to where they are now.
[01:13:12.473 --> 01:13:16.096]  His nightmare was always a mudslide of the dollar.
[01:13:16.116 --> 01:13:20.078]  In other words, once a dollar panic begins, how do you stop it?
[01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:21.439]  I think that's fairly close.
[01:13:21.459 --> 01:13:29.325]  I mean, it's one of the things that makes gold a reasonable hedge for the average person to try to protect some assets so that you won't be left with
[01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:31.971]  With just pieces of paper that are completely worthless.
[01:13:32.532 --> 01:13:37.014]  Now, briefly, what does it mean to have Obama going to the G20, but first dropping off to see the Queen?
[01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:38.956]  Doesn't look good, does it?
[01:13:38.976 --> 01:13:51.203]  You know, according to my friend Phil Berg there in Philadelphia, there's a very good chance that Obama is, if not a citizen of Indonesia, he may be a citizen of Kenya.
[01:13:51.403 --> 01:13:57.847]  And the point is that he's fully compromised with all these mafia and thugs, so speak what this means going to the Queen.
[01:13:59.128 --> 01:14:06.958]  Obama's grandfather was the house servant to Lord Delamere, who was the biggest British imperialist in Kenya between the World Wars.
[01:14:06.978 --> 01:14:09.461]  You remember Cecil Rhodes in South Africa.
[01:14:09.781 --> 01:14:12.745]  Lord Delamere was a person of similar caliber.
[01:14:12.765 --> 01:14:14.788]  He was a very important British operative.
[01:14:15.783 --> 01:14:16.703]  Obama is in there.
[01:14:17.264 --> 01:14:23.566]  It's interesting, when Gordon Brown came to visit Obama, the right-wing talk show host, the various Limbaugh's and Hannity's, went nuts over the idea.
[01:14:23.987 --> 01:14:26.508]  Obama snubbed Gordon Brown.
[01:14:26.548 --> 01:14:28.969]  He didn't give him the kind of hero's welcome that he deserved.
[01:14:29.009 --> 01:14:38.233]  Well, I think some of that was a dog-and-pony show, because the main idea is that Gordon Brown is the pioneer of all the bailouts, was Northern Rock.
[01:14:39.068 --> 01:14:43.872]  This bank in Britain and in Ireland began to blow up in October of 2007.
[01:14:43.952 --> 01:14:50.897]  That's when Gordon Brown, before any other government in the world had done it, said, here's several hundred billion pounds, not even dollars, but pounds.
[01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:51.497]  That's double.
[01:14:51.657 --> 01:14:51.878]  Yeah.
[01:14:52.138 --> 01:14:53.579]  Well, one and a half maybe.
[01:14:53.639 --> 01:14:54.840]  Well, at that time it was double.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.141]  It was up and down, yeah.
[01:14:56.161 --> 01:14:56.901]  At that time it was double.
[01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:57.362]  There we go.
[01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:58.102]  But hold on.
[01:14:58.442 --> 01:14:59.603]  I want to back you up on this.
[01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:07.229]  I watched hours online from the European Union official website of the parliamentary meetings he had for two days earlier this week.
[01:15:07.611 --> 01:15:09.652]  We play clips on the radio during the week, folks heard it.
[01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:20.417]  They openly in Europe worshipped him and said, you are the architect of the New World Order, you are running it all, and were bowing to him.
[01:15:20.457 --> 01:15:24.699]  Now I heard you months ago on my show say he was honchoing it, so you were right.
[01:15:25.059 --> 01:15:34.663]  Yeah, I think that the conceptual leadership of the entire process, this monstrous thing that we've been talking about, right, between what Geithner is doing and what the G20 is going to do,
[01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:41.074]  The beefing up of the IMF, the currency dictatorship, the SDRs, the world currency, all the rest of this stuff.
[01:15:41.094 --> 01:15:42.955]  It's all nuts, of course, in the last analysis.
[01:15:42.995 --> 01:15:51.562]  But this is Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, at the Chancellor of the Exchequer's office, and Mervyn King of the Bank of England.
[01:15:51.602 --> 01:15:57.566]  And they're reasserting this idea that the real center of the financial world is London, New York is collapsing.
[01:15:58.066 --> 01:16:04.591]  They like to think that the bankruptcy of places like Poland, Belarus, Ukraine,
[01:16:05.111 --> 01:16:08.734]  Are going to pull down the banks in Austria and Germany and France.
[01:16:09.054 --> 01:16:11.436]  The Euro may well collapse as a result of that.
[01:16:11.896 --> 01:16:13.977]  And that would leave London sitting pretty, right?
[01:16:14.017 --> 01:16:15.679]  Dollar collapsed, Euro collapsed.
[01:16:16.059 --> 01:16:18.461]  London leading the world once again.
[01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:23.124]  So the Empire is back with Gordon Brown and Obama is a stooge for this.
[01:16:24.199 --> 01:16:27.061]  All right, we'll be back with Webster Tarbley and your phone call straight ahead.
[01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:29.243]  Folks, what you're hearing is absolute precision.
[01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:30.463]  We know what's going on.
[01:16:30.483 --> 01:16:31.724]  We told you years before it happened.
[01:16:32.565 --> 01:16:35.106]  Travelers, and you're in to Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:16:35.207 --> 01:16:35.467]  March 27, 2009.
[01:16:35.527 --> 01:16:36.267]  Gold opened at $934.90.
[01:16:36.547 --> 01:16:39.730]  An ounce gold coin can be purchased for $961.76, $480.88 for half, and $240.44 for quarter.
[01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:40.210]  That's $961.76, $480.88, and $240.44.
[01:16:51.155 --> 01:17:03.558]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:17:03.678 --> 01:17:06.759]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:17:06.859 --> 01:17:10.119]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:17:10.179 --> 01:17:13.020]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.022]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:17:16.102 --> 01:17:18.805]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:17:19.005 --> 01:17:21.167]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:17:21.287 --> 01:17:23.549]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:27.873]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:17:27.913 --> 01:17:28.093]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:17:33.943 --> 01:17:39.408]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:17:39.448 --> 01:17:39.989]  and the world.
[01:17:40.249 --> 01:17:43.712]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[01:18:33.631 --> 01:18:35.133]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:18:35.313 --> 01:18:36.775]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:18:37.075 --> 01:18:39.297]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:18:39.758 --> 01:18:44.503]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:18:44.883 --> 01:18:47.746]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:18:48.086 --> 01:18:51.610]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[01:19:33.892 --> 01:19:34.772]  Spring is here.
[01:19:35.012 --> 01:19:35.793]  Growing season.
[01:19:35.973 --> 01:19:37.953]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.594]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:19:39.894 --> 01:19:40.554]  Think about it.
[01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:44.695]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:19:44.955 --> 01:19:48.436]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:19:48.696 --> 01:19:50.316]  The country is running out of food.
[01:19:50.596 --> 01:19:53.097]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:19:53.417 --> 01:20:05.331]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:08.234]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass,
[01:20:08.274 --> 01:20:08.614]  I think so.
[01:20:37.438 --> 01:20:43.803]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:43.823 --> 01:20:51.610]  Just want to say my crew in here, Paul Hartman, good old Jaron Neihart, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson.
[01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:54.412]  We're in here filming today for the next Obama film.
[01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:56.874]  It's coming out July 4th.
[01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:58.916]  Tell you more about it in the name of the new film next week.
[01:20:59.036 --> 01:21:03.540]  That's right, we're hitting them hard with a jab to the nose and then a big hook.
[01:21:05.185 --> 01:21:07.046]  Yeah, a haymaker, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:07.066 --> 01:21:10.668]  So let's go ahead and tell you what's coming up after we take some calls.
[01:21:11.068 --> 01:21:13.089]  Mandatory Service Bill lives on.
[01:21:13.429 --> 01:21:14.910]  That is coming up.
[01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:16.751]  Webster, let's go to some phone calls.
[01:21:17.092 --> 01:21:19.293]  Folks have been patiently holding them, so they're all over the map.
[01:21:19.773 --> 01:21:21.514]  The phone's loaded the second we started the show.
[01:21:22.215 --> 01:21:23.716]  Let's talk to Joe in Houston.
[01:21:23.736 --> 01:21:24.936]  You're on the air worldwide, Joe.
[01:21:25.817 --> 01:21:27.698]  Gentlemen, I admire your courage.
[01:21:28.418 --> 01:21:31.020]  I want to debunk the global warming hoax.
[01:21:31.872 --> 01:21:39.282]  The cause of climate change, the major cause, is geonuclear, which comes out of the center of the Earth, has absolutely nothing to do with carbon dioxide.
[01:21:39.302 --> 01:21:43.307]  Well, all the major... I mean, the real studies show it's the sun as the major climate driver.
[01:21:43.367 --> 01:21:47.393]  No, I dispute that, but I'm going to send you a scientific paper that I've prepared on this.
[01:21:47.493 --> 01:21:48.134]  I'm an engineer.
[01:21:49.535 --> 01:21:55.058]  I'm not debating you that geothermal has a massive... We'll discuss that at a future time.
[01:21:55.078 --> 01:22:06.604]  But let me just say, what their claim is, and they're hanging their hat on, is that the current level of carbon dioxide, 370 parts per million, is going to increase by 5, and that's going to be a problem.
[01:22:07.465 --> 01:22:09.526]  Let me put that in physical terms.
[01:22:09.606 --> 01:22:12.408]  It's been 14 times higher before from the ice core samples.
[01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:12.808]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:13.008 --> 01:22:13.348]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:13.768 --> 01:22:14.049]  Okay.
[01:22:16.129 --> 01:22:19.231]  A million BBs is 20 gallons of BBs.
[01:22:19.471 --> 01:22:22.733]  These people are telling you if you add five more BBs, you've got a huge problem.
[01:22:23.393 --> 01:22:26.435]  Well, carbon is absolutely necessary.
[01:22:26.535 --> 01:22:28.556]  I mean, carbon dioxide is absolutely necessary.
[01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:30.277]  We are carbon-based life forms.
[01:22:30.317 --> 01:22:31.317]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:22:31.437 --> 01:22:32.218]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:34.139]  I'm going to get Webster, who's an expert on this.
[01:22:34.499 --> 01:22:35.079]  Webster Blake.
[01:22:35.139 --> 01:22:38.701]  I'm going to email you my scientific analysis of this thing.
[01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:39.381]  You'll be interested.
[01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:42.043]  Well, I mean, to be clear though, caller Joe, and I agree with you.
[01:22:42.703 --> 01:22:48.525]  They've had thousands, what, 30-something thousand scientists have sent letters to the UN, engineers, climatologists saying it's a fraud.
[01:22:48.825 --> 01:22:52.506]  The 2,000 the UN had, most of them went back on it saying they just put our names on this.
[01:22:53.146 --> 01:22:54.947]  They know it's a scam, sir.
[01:22:55.247 --> 01:22:58.308]  They know that carbon dioxide is good and plants breathe it.
[01:22:58.368 --> 01:23:01.309]  They know that the Earth heats first and then you get...
[01:23:01.749 --> 01:23:13.578]  What I've done for you, Alex, is I've put all this in a five-page coherent form that you can post on your website that anybody with a decent high school education will be able to understand and argue with anybody that's still a Kool-Aid trigger.
[01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:14.559]  Alright, do me a favor, Joe.
[01:23:14.619 --> 01:23:16.641]  Send it to Rob D. That's one of my producers.
[01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:20.284]  Rob D, just the letter D, at InfoWars.com.
[01:23:20.304 --> 01:23:21.605]  And I don't want to hang up on you yet.
[01:23:22.005 --> 01:23:28.370]  Webster, I mean, break down what's really happening with the global climate tax, taxing the very carbon cycle of terra firma.
[01:23:29.167 --> 01:23:32.189]  Well, it amounts to a tax on production.
[01:23:32.349 --> 01:23:35.992]  In other words, physical, tangible, commodity production.
[01:23:36.152 --> 01:23:36.853]  Useful goods.
[01:23:36.913 --> 01:23:42.577]  Things you can eat, wear, drive, live in, use as a machine tool, anything of this sort.
[01:23:42.837 --> 01:23:44.518]  That's where the carbon tax is going to fall.
[01:23:44.638 --> 01:23:49.902]  It's designed really to crush what remains of an industrial economy, especially in the U.S.
[01:23:50.042 --> 01:23:52.644]  And the IMF and World Bank and the Club of Rome state this.
[01:23:52.904 --> 01:23:55.326]  They're waging war against any real economy.
[01:23:56.371 --> 01:24:08.298]  And at the same time, it's also designed to make these other marginal forms of energy production, the windmills or solar cells, which are anti-economical, to make them look as if they're actually economical.
[01:24:08.338 --> 01:24:13.000]  Remember, with a windmill or a solar cell, you never break even in energy terms.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.722]  In other words, the energy you've got to put in to manufacture it, you'll never get out of it.
[01:24:17.022 --> 01:24:21.725]  And also in monetary terms, you won't get the money out of it that you spend for creating it.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.561]  It's an entire scam.
[01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:29.547]  Now, what does this really express is sort of the eternal insanity of the oligarch and the banker.
[01:24:30.047 --> 01:24:38.495]  Al Gore, of course, is a crackpot and a charlatan, and I welcome what you're saying because it shows that, indeed, the debate is not over, Al Gore.
[01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:40.477]  There's a very lively debate going on.
[01:24:41.898 --> 01:24:42.659]  No, I don't.
[01:24:59.239 --> 01:25:04.382]  And let me stop you, but solar radiation is not a constant.
[01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:05.703]  The sun is heating.
[01:25:05.963 --> 01:25:10.445]  No, the geonuclear force is not constant either.
[01:25:10.825 --> 01:25:13.027]  We've got uranium that's down in the center of the earth.
[01:25:13.107 --> 01:25:13.967]  It's decomposing.
[01:25:14.027 --> 01:25:15.528]  It's creating a lot of internal heat.
[01:25:15.848 --> 01:25:16.569]  It melts rock.
[01:25:17.829 --> 01:25:19.692]  No, no, I've seen those studies.
[01:25:33.367 --> 01:25:35.588]  Sir, I've seen those studies.
[01:25:36.128 --> 01:25:36.909]  I understand that.
[01:25:37.309 --> 01:25:48.196]  It's just I've been reading what the climatologists and solar experts say, and certainly geothermal and volcanic alone, one small part of the geothermal system, dwarfs all human activity alone.
[01:25:48.217 --> 01:25:50.138]  So I agree that you're right in that.
[01:25:50.158 --> 01:26:02.246]  I'm saying the sun itself is a much larger driver in whole, not just with its overall radiation, but the particuli, the particles that come in for cloud seeding in the mid-atmosphere.
[01:26:02.746 --> 01:26:07.769]  I would also say that the solar activity is the one that I find most convincing.
[01:26:07.809 --> 01:26:14.172]  You got to think about Eric the Red and Leif Erikson and these people coming to Newfoundland and calling it Vineland.
[01:26:14.272 --> 01:26:17.073]  Well, that means that we're nowhere near as warm as it was.
[01:26:17.093 --> 01:26:20.875]  Yeah, Greenland's ice today, but they called it Greenland and reported it was all green.
[01:26:21.195 --> 01:26:27.198]  Right, so I think we're very well within the oscillation band of just historical records of the last
[01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:27.899]  I think so.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:58.548]  And by the way, it's come out that there's a carbon exchange in Chicago that Barack Obama owns part of, and Al Gore literally owns the majority stock in the big European carbon trading.
[01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:01.650]  So you're going to buy your carbon indulgences from Al Gore.
[01:27:01.891 --> 01:27:05.974]  What they're going to do is once this carbon cap and trade exists, if it ever does,
[01:27:06.534 --> 01:27:08.895]  That will be a way for Goldman Sachs to come in.
[01:27:08.915 --> 01:27:11.295]  Now, Goldman Sachs has got the number two guy.
[01:27:11.355 --> 01:27:17.777]  Geithner's right-hand man is this guy, Patterson, who's the green economist from Goldman Sachs.
[01:27:17.817 --> 01:27:27.260]  So, once the carbon offsets exist, they can bid them up, and that will shut down all of industrial production, because the price will go up as the hedge funds move in and buy these things.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.141]  So, a speculative market and its carbon offsets leading to the end of production as we've known it.
[01:27:32.261 --> 01:27:33.381]  Let's take another call quickly.
[01:27:33.441 --> 01:27:34.482]  Barry in California.
[01:27:34.802 --> 01:27:35.402]  Barry, go ahead.
[01:27:35.982 --> 01:27:37.103]  How you guys doing today?
[01:27:37.123 --> 01:27:39.945]  I really appreciate you having Leslie on today.
[01:27:39.965 --> 01:27:42.187]  He really hits the nail.
[01:27:42.707 --> 01:27:43.648]  I'll call him Leslie.
[01:27:43.988 --> 01:27:44.809]  He's Leslie.
[01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:46.730]  Austin's icon.
[01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:47.651]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:27:48.592 --> 01:27:50.793]  I want to tell you what I'm going to do this week.
[01:27:51.053 --> 01:27:56.277]  I'm going to make a sign and I'm going to say, wake up, we the people.
[01:27:57.078 --> 01:27:58.099]  Where is the
[01:27:58.962 --> 01:28:01.064]  You know, the madness of what's going on.
[01:28:01.885 --> 01:28:05.368]  Don't look at the $160 million bonus, but look at the $10 trillion biggest...
[01:28:10.143 --> 01:28:25.594]  Bankruptcy of the American taxpayer, and then I'm going to put, check out the number one video online, Obama Deception, on YouTube, and I'm going to have Infowars.com, repent before it's too late.
[01:28:26.095 --> 01:28:29.517]  And repent, the canonical repentance is destroy all derivatives.
[01:28:29.557 --> 01:28:31.298]  Shred them, delete them, and get rid of them.
[01:28:31.318 --> 01:28:31.919]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:36.903]  Instead of getting the bankers in trouble, Webster, I will buy indulgences, carbon indulgences.
[01:28:38.197 --> 01:28:41.040]  But I just understand what Wesley's saying.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.942]  I understand what it's on the abominate section.
[01:28:42.962 --> 01:28:44.744]  I've been passing out left and right.
[01:28:45.725 --> 01:28:49.689]  And I ask people to look at it objectively and with an open mind.
[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:53.573]  And I let them know that you break up the left and the right paradigm.
[01:28:54.174 --> 01:28:58.058]  And that they have to understand, they have to educate themselves on what's going on.
[01:28:58.118 --> 01:28:59.840]  And I said this movie will open your eyes.
[01:29:00.313 --> 01:29:01.274]  Good job, my friend.
[01:29:01.294 --> 01:29:02.095]  Good to hear from you.
[01:29:02.515 --> 01:29:04.016]  We don't have time to make another call right now.
[01:29:04.036 --> 01:29:04.577]  We're going to come back.
[01:29:04.597 --> 01:29:06.078]  I've got to race through your calls to get to everybody.
[01:29:06.098 --> 01:29:13.345]  The toll free number to join us is 877-590-5525 or locally in Central Texas.

[01:30:28.592 --> 01:30:28.972]  Call today.
[01:30:33.776 --> 01:30:35.037]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:40.420]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.283]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:45.683 --> 01:30:50.766]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:30:51.266 --> 01:30:55.969]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:56.489 --> 01:30:58.370]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:30:58.795 --> 01:31:03.397]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:31:17.904 --> 01:31:19.064]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:31:27.904 --> 01:31:30.112]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:30.454 --> 01:31:32.842]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:33.357 --> 01:31:40.322]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:44.865]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[01:32:34.534 --> 01:32:35.315]  Growing season.
[01:32:35.495 --> 01:32:37.475]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:32:37.696 --> 01:32:39.096]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:32:39.396 --> 01:32:40.076]  Think about it.
[01:32:40.376 --> 01:32:44.218]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:47.939]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:32:48.219 --> 01:32:49.840]  The country is running out of food.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.681]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:32:52.941 --> 01:32:59.863]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs,

[01:33:43.911 --> 01:33:46.892]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:33:46.992 --> 01:33:50.173]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[01:33:52.734 --> 01:33:59.800]  If we have any future, we're going to expose the criminal parasite bankers.
[01:34:00.241 --> 01:34:08.488]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you were ever to stop the bankers, they would just, with the stroke of a pen, create enough money to buy up the world again overnight.
[01:34:09.529 --> 01:34:10.170]  To paraphrase.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:16.045]  And this country's entire history has been about the struggle against the bankers.
[01:34:16.085 --> 01:34:21.210]  I want to go to the phone calls, right back to the calls, but Webster Tarbley, specifically on that issue.
[01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:30.881]  I mean, the Founding Fathers, the people that came after it, Lincoln, so many others, they continually fought against offshore British bankers coming in and taking over this country.
[01:34:30.901 --> 01:34:31.822]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[01:34:32.342 --> 01:34:39.225]  Well, in economics, there's something called the American System of Political Economy, which is homegrown, and it's the only successful one.
[01:34:39.265 --> 01:34:43.046]  All the other schools are basically British or some other foreign version.
[01:34:43.106 --> 01:34:48.628]  Now, it's Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts, it's Benjamin Franklin, the founder of the Post Office.
[01:34:49.048 --> 01:34:52.289]  Alexander Hamilton is the leading light of this, and there's just no way around it.
[01:34:52.309 --> 01:34:54.470]  There's no way you can edit him out of the history.
[01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:59.012]  Henry Clay of Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln, a follower of him, but also some theoreticians.
[01:34:59.052 --> 01:34:59.632]  Friedrich List,
[01:35:00.593 --> 01:35:05.315]  Who built all the railroads in Austria before coming to Reading, Pennsylvania and becoming a citizen.
[01:35:05.355 --> 01:35:07.256]  Henry Carey, the big advisor to Lincoln.
[01:35:07.657 --> 01:35:10.478]  Justin Morrill, who built the transcontinental railroads.
[01:35:11.558 --> 01:35:14.780]  Then you get these prairie populists and finally you get the New Deal.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.382]  The New Deal has a lot of this in it and the attempt to revive that under Kennedy.
[01:35:18.702 --> 01:35:23.724]  So you either have progress and upward mobility or you collapse into Dark Ages.
[01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:26.085]  Right, that's the imperative that civilization faces.
[01:35:26.125 --> 01:35:29.347]  Now one of the things is you've got to gear up scientific
[01:35:29.867 --> 01:35:32.468]  Technological industrial progress.
[01:35:33.108 --> 01:35:35.428]  There's no way you get out of this just by tinkering with money.
[01:35:35.809 --> 01:35:46.031]  You've got to have things like a program for the exploration, permanent colonization, and industrial production on the moon, Mars, and other nearby objects in space.
[01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:51.112]  You've got to have a program of research into high-energy physics, so you get... Here's an example of pure research.
[01:35:51.152 --> 01:35:51.713]  Look at the internet.
[01:35:51.733 --> 01:35:53.333]  We would have no economy if it wasn't for that.
[01:35:53.553 --> 01:35:54.454]  Hello, this is Tony.
[01:35:54.554 --> 01:35:59.478]  I'm here at the flood and the military has been dispatched and they've been evacuating places that haven't been and been arresting random people.
[01:36:22.494 --> 01:36:24.315]  Going through areas that haven't been going.
[01:36:24.355 --> 01:36:24.755]  That's right.
[01:36:24.835 --> 01:36:25.775]  Any excuse now.
[01:36:25.795 --> 01:36:27.476]  DWI checkpoints.
[01:36:28.137 --> 01:36:29.357]  The mass shooting in Alabama.
[01:36:29.678 --> 01:36:32.059]  Troops show up as they set the precedent for this.
[01:36:32.099 --> 01:36:32.779]  Webster Darbley.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.201]  I'd like to hear more from the caller.
[01:36:36.101 --> 01:36:38.883]  I even have pictures of a black helicopter.
[01:36:40.904 --> 01:36:43.585]  It's in the news, Webster, that they're using troops basically for anything.
[01:36:43.606 --> 01:36:44.226]  Yeah, I'm sure they are.
[01:36:44.486 --> 01:36:46.007]  So what's going on with the flood?
[01:36:48.528 --> 01:36:49.529]  With the flood?
[01:36:49.549 --> 01:36:49.929]  Yeah, the flood.
[01:36:49.949 --> 01:36:51.330]  You said you're from the flood area, right?
[01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:53.271]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:53.732 --> 01:37:01.965]  The snow, we got like a three-day blizzard and we got like five feet and it melted in.
[01:37:02.085 --> 01:37:03.587]  Global warming is hitting you hard.
[01:37:04.188 --> 01:37:04.910]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:05.552 --> 01:37:05.732]  Yeah.
[01:37:06.052 --> 01:37:07.713]  We need a whole bunch of that right now.
[01:37:07.733 --> 01:37:14.558]  I mean, I would say one of the things you could do as a stimulus project is to rebuild the levees, dikes, and water systems so you wouldn't have flooding.
[01:37:14.598 --> 01:37:15.178]  How about that?
[01:37:15.238 --> 01:37:16.399]  Yeah, humans need goals.
[01:37:16.479 --> 01:37:17.180]  Thank you, caller.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:17.880]  Sorry to hear about that.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:18.801]  I know there's floods everywhere.
[01:37:19.341 --> 01:37:24.544]  Let's go ahead and talk to, in this record cold weather, because of global warming, Hamilton in Colorado.
[01:37:24.564 --> 01:37:25.125]  You're on the air.
[01:37:25.165 --> 01:37:25.505]  Go ahead.
[01:37:26.317 --> 01:37:30.780]  Hey, uh, I hope that both of you celebrated Earth Hour yesterday.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:42.387]  Yeah, they turned off lights all over the world, teaching us lights, you know, and fire, and they're trying to restrict fireplaces in Europe, and again, we've got to have feudal lords that rule every facet of our lives.
[01:37:42.887 --> 01:37:46.009]  And if you don't do it, then it must mean you want the planet to burn up.
[01:37:46.449 --> 01:37:51.493]  Well, I actually sat that one out, and I'm wondering whether Al Gore turned off his heated pool in his...
[01:37:52.575 --> 01:37:55.035]  His energy guzzling house that he's got down there.
[01:37:55.055 --> 01:38:01.857]  Well, he's got about five houses, but he does have a 9,000 square foot one that uses about 10 times the energy of the average home, but that's okay.
[01:38:01.897 --> 01:38:02.137]  Right.
[01:38:02.537 --> 01:38:03.877]  Well, he's an oligarch.
[01:38:03.897 --> 01:38:08.698]  Well, I mean, he buys carbon offset credits from his own company, so it's okay.
[01:38:08.958 --> 01:38:09.138]  Right.
[01:38:09.198 --> 01:38:13.319]  And of course, carbon offsets are carbon offsets that never happened in the world.
[01:38:13.379 --> 01:38:18.700]  In other words, they say, yeah, we planted an acre of grass in Africa, but don't go over there because it never happened.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:19.820]  It's a complete scam.
[01:38:20.991 --> 01:38:22.852]  He's basically in the same league with Madoff, right?
[01:38:22.892 --> 01:38:26.053]  Madoff's investments and Al Gore's carbon offsets are in the same league.
[01:38:26.073 --> 01:38:47.459]  I was looking at their website for Earth Hour, and I was looking at supporters, and it showed the logo of the United Nations and the WWF, and of course, WWF was the first president, I believe Prince Bernhard, who also happened to be the founder of the Bullerberg Group.
[01:38:47.959 --> 01:38:48.560]  And a Nazi.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:49.201]  Yeah, and a Nazi.
[01:38:49.221 --> 01:38:53.646]  He was a member of the Brown Shirts, the S.A., and of the Black Shirts, the S.S.
[01:38:54.127 --> 01:39:05.360]  So he was a leading Nazi, and it was Prince Bernard of Holland who joined together with Prince Philip, who's the guy who wants to come back as a deadly virus to kill people to solve the problem of overpopulation.
[01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:12.576]  And that's right, and when you say that to people, it's funny that it's so outrageous, they immediately say, you're full of it.
[01:39:12.616 --> 01:39:16.619]  Oh, well that's Reuters, and he always says, I want to come back as a deadly virus.
[01:39:16.639 --> 01:39:24.466]  Don't forget Prince Charles, he says, he talks to his plants, I guess anybody can talk to their plants, but then he says, they answer me, my plants answer me back.
[01:39:24.886 --> 01:39:28.969]  Obama will be visiting the Queen, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles this coming
[01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.872]  This coming week, so we'll see what comes out of that.
[01:39:31.892 --> 01:39:32.713]  Sure, good to hear from you.
[01:39:32.773 --> 01:39:35.035]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Tampa, Florida.
[01:39:35.055 --> 01:39:35.855]  You're on the air, Chris.
[01:39:36.536 --> 01:39:38.037]  Hey, Webster, great show on Saturday.
[01:39:38.077 --> 01:39:51.409]  There's no doubt there's plenty of oil, and I'm no doubt a pay biotic, but there are many university studies also showing that there's more seismic activity, including tsunami, in areas of greater oil drilling.
[01:39:52.069 --> 01:39:53.651]  Now, about Obama, during his
[01:39:53.951 --> 01:39:54.331]  Yes, we are.
[01:40:17.124 --> 01:40:31.330]  433 of which he has not yet taken action, many thankfully so, such as forcing participation in 401K and IRAs, and he also promised to investigate political conflict of interest between credit rating agencies and both financial institutions.
[01:40:31.931 --> 01:40:40.735]  But, you know, regarding the lobbyists, on their Obamiter, you know, just like a newspaper to drop vowels,
[01:40:41.275 --> 01:40:59.421]  They talk about the PSYOP, I would call it, when after he took office he signed the executive order on the lobbyists allowing him, the president, to sign waivers arbitrarily and otherwise if they didn't have a waiver they would have to voluntarily recuse themselves
[01:40:59.941 --> 01:41:03.283]  Don't hold your breath, because he always does the opposite of what he says.
[01:41:03.343 --> 01:41:05.704]  I think Obama is going to rewrite his memoir there.
[01:41:05.724 --> 01:41:07.485]  He called it the audacity of hope.
[01:41:07.505 --> 01:41:09.867]  He's going to recast that as the mendacity of dope.
[01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.497]  Uh, based on the fact that he welshes on all of his promises.
[01:41:31.238 --> 01:41:32.419]  Well, truth you can deceive him.
[01:41:32.819 --> 01:41:41.107]  Mark Patterson, the Chief of Staff to the Treasury Secretary, uh, in public records, we know that Patterson worked as a lobbyist for, uh, Goldman Sachs in 2008.
[01:41:41.147 --> 01:41:44.350]  Well, I mean, look at the Chief of Staff for the White House!
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:42:02.280]  He comes off Wall Street as being paid 17 million a year scamming people, and at the same time takes Senator Dodd's wife at AIG, getting the money that he put in there as a little loophole for the bonuses while he's out saying he's fighting the bonuses, and he's the author of them.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.763]  I mean, these people are congenital liars.
[01:42:05.569 --> 01:42:08.572]  And I'd recommend you link to the story at politifact.com.
[01:42:08.653 --> 01:42:13.758]  I don't see that you do right now, but it's campaign promise 240 regarding lobbyists.
[01:42:14.079 --> 01:42:18.984]  And they asked the White House press office, this is what's Politifact is run by the St.
[01:42:19.004 --> 01:42:22.348]  Pete Times, which I don't, I'm not particularly fond of.
[01:42:22.408 --> 01:42:25.451]  They're not, they're more dishonest.
[01:42:26.152 --> 01:42:26.432]  No, I know.
[01:42:26.452 --> 01:42:29.454]  If you go to Politifact, it's just he lies about everything congenitally.
[01:42:30.035 --> 01:42:33.097]  And, you know, Webster, that's a point we've got to make when I complete the interview after the show.
[01:42:33.117 --> 01:42:34.037]  We're going to keep taping in here.
[01:42:34.417 --> 01:42:37.519]  But, I mean, literally, it's like the super lobbyist administration.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:39.641]  It's amazing.
[01:42:39.681 --> 01:42:41.262]  He said he wouldn't hire one of them, though, Webster.
[01:42:42.205 --> 01:42:45.926]  Well, he always was taking money from people who were in the same law firm.
[01:42:45.966 --> 01:42:53.548]  And he'd say, if a mega law firm had one or two designated lobbyists, he wouldn't take it from them, but the rest of them could bundle and he'd take it from others.
[01:42:53.588 --> 01:42:55.368]  So, it's basically word games.
[01:42:55.408 --> 01:42:57.169]  Anyway, this doesn't get us anywhere.
[01:42:57.189 --> 01:43:02.810]  The point is that this is the most controlled administration by Wall Street.
[01:43:03.522 --> 01:43:05.424]  I think in all of American history, by far.
[01:43:05.444 --> 01:43:07.445]  In other words, it's a place where there's only one interest.
[01:43:07.885 --> 01:43:10.628]  It's the banking, financier, derivatives, hedge fund interest.
[01:43:11.228 --> 01:43:14.210]  And people like heavy industry, they have to grovel, right?
[01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:15.431]  They have to show they're viable.
[01:43:15.451 --> 01:43:21.176]  Yeah, let's talk about, uh, they have to prove that they're viable with the car companies, with the bankers.
[01:43:21.196 --> 01:43:22.016]  They can all stay there.
[01:43:22.257 --> 01:43:24.678]  We'll also tell you about mandatory service bill lives on.
[01:43:25.019 --> 01:43:26.800]  You want a national draft for you and your family?
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:27.260]  Get ready.
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:29.622]  Obama is bringing slavery back in.

[01:45:20.388 --> 01:45:20.949]  Ask yourself,
[01:45:21.249 --> 01:45:24.214]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[01:45:24.475 --> 01:45:26.819]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[01:47:44.031 --> 01:47:48.833]  There must be some kind of way out of here, said the joker to the thief.
[01:47:48.853 --> 01:47:50.313]  There's too much confusion.
[01:47:51.093 --> 01:47:52.254]  I can't get no relief.
[01:47:52.274 --> 01:47:59.596]  Webster Tarpley, either the bankers get arrested, the new order falls, a new
[01:48:07.259 --> 01:48:12.441]  Incredible age of renaissance can begin, or we're going into a new dark age, aren't we?
[01:48:12.461 --> 01:48:12.961]  That's a choice.
[01:48:13.221 --> 01:48:17.383]  And if you thought Obama was going to be the key to getting out of this, it's been a terrible mistake.
[01:48:17.463 --> 01:48:19.604]  It's been a bogus sham and a cruel hoax.
[01:48:19.664 --> 01:48:32.369]  So, Obama turns out to be the deployment of the bankers to make sure that there would be no solution for the crisis, but only endless bailouts of the derivatives and endless war and imperialism around the world.
[01:48:32.449 --> 01:48:34.030]  And endless dictatorship at home.
[01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:36.031]  Next issue, we'll take a few final calls.
[01:48:37.199 --> 01:48:41.804]  You wrote a book a year ago about this, saying mandatory service from their own writings, what they were planning.
[01:48:43.806 --> 01:48:46.528]  They've passed the bills for National Compulsory Service last week.
[01:48:46.569 --> 01:48:47.910]  We barely got stripped out.
[01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:49.351]  Compulsory Service.
[01:48:49.752 --> 01:48:53.255]  But now they've introduced another bill, and everything's racing through by two-thirds majorities.
[01:48:53.716 --> 01:48:55.477]  Mandatory Service Bill lives on.
[01:48:55.497 --> 01:48:57.740]  Infowars.com, but we linked to the Associated Press.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.901]  It seemed like a victory of sorts last week.
[01:48:59.921 --> 01:49:02.942]  The Senate approved a bill to radically expand the AmeriCorps program.
[01:49:02.962 --> 01:49:12.387]  The bill initially contained language, proposed a study for mandatory service for all young people in the United States, but the language was removed as the bill moved through the Senate and did not appear in the final version.
[01:49:12.447 --> 01:49:13.147]  Well, it's back!
[01:49:13.587 --> 01:49:16.848]  The language was stripped from one bill, but it suddenly appeared in another.
[01:49:17.148 --> 01:49:18.509]  It's now contained in H.R.
[01:49:18.529 --> 01:49:24.491]  1444, up on Infowars.com, due to crawl across the House floor this week.
[01:49:24.731 --> 01:49:24.991]  H.R.
[01:49:25.011 --> 01:49:32.973]  1444 is sponsored by Representative Jim McDermott, a Washington State Democrat, and is assigned to the House Committee on Labor and Education.
[01:49:32.993 --> 01:49:37.195]  It has word-for-word what was in the other bill, the bill under Section 4B.6 states
[01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:52.036]  Mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed and how such a requirement can be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the nation overcome, then it goes through the military service and all the rest of it.
[01:49:52.056 --> 01:49:53.697]  So, this is slavery.
[01:49:54.434 --> 01:50:01.597]  Yeah, you can call it slave labor, forced labor, compulsory military service, all being bootlegged in under left cover.
[01:50:01.697 --> 01:50:07.360]  Stuff that Bush could never dare to even imagine is now being flaunted, really, by the Obama people.
[01:50:08.441 --> 01:50:09.061]  Let's look at it.
[01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:17.265]  When Mussolini seized power in Italy in October 1922, one of the first things he did was to create the Voluntary National Service Militia.
[01:50:18.065 --> 01:50:19.746]  Voluntary National Security Militia.
[01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:23.468]  That then created a group called O.V.R.A., the OVRA.
[01:50:23.528 --> 01:50:28.249]  The OVRA was the Voluntary Anti-Fascist Suppression Organization.
[01:50:28.649 --> 01:50:31.910]  Now, when the Nazis came to power, they wanted to create the Gestapo.
[01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:34.750]  They sent Heinrich Himmler and others to study the OVRA.
[01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:42.012]  So, out of these innocent-sounding voluntary militia organizations come some pretty horrendous secret police organizations.
[01:50:42.032 --> 01:50:49.194]  He's also using federal money to run TV ads to join his private group, USAService.org, and other groups.
[01:50:49.214 --> 01:50:49.994]  I mean, this is illegal!
[01:50:50.454 --> 01:50:50.634]  Yeah.
[01:50:50.714 --> 01:50:58.140]  Any time you get this blurring of the government and the private sector, where the banks, big business, and government merge, that's the fascist corporate state.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.041]  That's what we have now.
[01:50:59.441 --> 01:51:07.207]  Obama promised a National Service Corps that would be on the scale of the Pentagon, an unbelievable statement, but that's what he said.
[01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:08.108]  That's a trillion bucks a year.
[01:51:08.188 --> 01:51:08.789]  Yeah, huge.
[01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:15.514]  Then you've got the Classroom Corps, obviously scabs and strikebreakers to break teachers' unions in principal cities.
[01:51:16.078 --> 01:51:25.484]  You've got the Green Corps, hooligans that can be used to attack industrialists or anybody interested in producing... Yeah, land-grabbing cultist enforcers.
[01:51:25.564 --> 01:51:25.724]  Right.
[01:51:26.025 --> 01:51:27.606]  I mean, ACORN, it can be all this stuff.
[01:51:28.106 --> 01:51:29.947]  And then you've got the Senior Corps.
[01:51:30.127 --> 01:51:35.511]  These would be low-paid strikebreakers and scabs that could be used to bust any union or any strike.
[01:51:36.011 --> 01:51:39.476]  And then, of course, the AmeriCorps, and it goes on and on.
[01:51:39.516 --> 01:51:41.559]  And now he's got Organize for America.
[01:51:41.899 --> 01:51:44.322]  And again, all of these are these strange hybrids, right?
[01:51:44.583 --> 01:51:49.269]  Whenever you hear the word public-private partnership, think fascist corporate state.
[01:51:49.329 --> 01:51:50.671]  And the G.A.O.
[01:51:50.731 --> 01:51:53.355]  has said this is all illegal and they just don't care.
[01:51:53.775 --> 01:52:01.097]  They just don't care, and of course he had done in the campaign, he blurred, you know, the obamatransition.gov when it was not the transition.gov.
[01:52:01.137 --> 01:52:06.159]  It was transition.privateobama and run by Soros and David Rockefeller, not gov.
[01:52:06.539 --> 01:52:08.019]  So, this is a terrible, terrible situation.
[01:52:08.039 --> 01:52:11.480]  By the way, Soros is in the Times of London saying he's having the time of his life.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.722]  I'm having a great crisis, is the headline, and he says this is the culmination of my life, raping you.
[01:52:16.762 --> 01:52:17.442]  He just loves it.
[01:52:17.802 --> 01:52:21.784]  It's like Rahm Emanuel saying, you never let a crisis go unexploited, right?
[01:52:21.824 --> 01:52:23.244]  You gotta get the most you can out of it.
[01:52:23.544 --> 01:52:34.646]  What they're saying is that since they've got Obama now in the catbird seat, they can dictate a whole series of institutional reforms, union busting, silencing of political opposition under the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:52:34.666 --> 01:52:38.247]  He's signing, according to PC World, a secret global treaty to restrict the web.
[01:52:38.487 --> 01:52:39.587]  I want to take a few final calls.
[01:52:39.967 --> 01:52:44.748]  Josie in Houston, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:52:46.188 --> 01:52:47.549]  Hello, Mr. Webster Tarpley?
[01:52:48.049 --> 01:52:48.429]  Yes, sir.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:54.804]  I was just wondering, how can we trust anyone who has a Jewish wife and children like Einstein here?
[01:52:54.824 --> 01:52:55.704]  You know, Alex Jones?
[01:52:55.844 --> 01:52:57.505]  And this is Joe Blow, mother fucker!
[01:52:59.307 --> 01:53:00.528]  I think that's despicable.
[01:53:01.588 --> 01:53:02.829]  I repeat it in every way.
[01:53:02.849 --> 01:53:04.770]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:53:06.972 --> 01:53:08.573]  Alright, fantastic.
[01:53:08.853 --> 01:53:09.814]  Let's continue.
[01:53:10.054 --> 01:53:11.675]  There are people with their fantasies, yes.
[01:53:12.336 --> 01:53:14.197]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:53:14.277 --> 01:53:16.779]  Louis in North, in New York.
[01:53:17.219 --> 01:53:18.100]  Louis, you're on the air.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:18.520]  Go ahead.
[01:53:19.611 --> 01:53:20.291]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:21.412]  I'm a long-time listener.
[01:53:21.432 --> 01:53:24.334]  Real quick, I just want to make a comment.
[01:53:24.474 --> 01:53:35.540]  I have a family member that works for UBS, Payne Webber, and they had a mandatory meeting where they had a guest speaker, Colonel Edward L. Hubbard, a U.S.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:41.364]  Air Force colonel who is retired, who wrote a book called Escape from the Box.
[01:53:41.404 --> 01:53:48.588]  He was a former war prisoner, and he came to speak and talk about hard times and how to overcome
[01:53:49.474 --> 01:53:49.954]  We're good to go.
[01:54:06.348 --> 01:54:18.831]  Yeah, what's happening is, sir, under InfraGar, 50,000 executives, they're teaching everybody martial law is coming, we're going to protect you, everything's fine, 26,000 preachers telling their flocks to take the inoculations, go to the camps.
[01:54:19.571 --> 01:54:24.252]  This is their ace in the hole plan, also crashing the web with a fake Chinese cyber attack.
[01:54:24.532 --> 01:54:25.713]  That's another one of their plans.
[01:54:26.213 --> 01:54:28.273]  And so this is very creepy.
[01:54:28.654 --> 01:54:30.114]  Total martial law is being set up.
[01:54:30.154 --> 01:54:30.454]  Go ahead.
[01:54:31.549 --> 01:54:38.071]  Yeah, I just wanted to put that out there as further evidence that they get ready to go through with this.
[01:54:38.131 --> 01:54:44.032]  I mean, they're already putting it in the minds of people that something's going to happen.
[01:54:44.512 --> 01:54:54.435]  I mean, to tell the employees that they can't build in to go to their families in case of emergency, and they're going to be formally taken somewhere.
[01:54:56.047 --> 01:54:59.049]  I mean, there's no reason for that.
[01:54:59.269 --> 01:55:02.091]  In case of emergency, my first priority is to get home.
[01:55:02.431 --> 01:55:08.676]  How are you going to tell me that I can't leave the building and I have to stay here and to go where I'm directed to?
[01:55:08.696 --> 01:55:13.419]  Well, they're also planning that with the public schools to take the children to the local sports stadiums.
[01:55:13.699 --> 01:55:17.702]  Schwarzenegger's announced, also Hawaii's announcing, you can't be homeless, you can't live in a tent city.
[01:55:17.722 --> 01:55:21.905]  We're going to make everybody go to the sports arenas and to the fairgrounds.
[01:55:22.345 --> 01:55:22.945]  It's amazing.
[01:55:22.965 --> 01:55:24.206]  Did you speak up or say anything?
[01:55:24.246 --> 01:55:26.107]  Or you were just watching?
[01:55:26.627 --> 01:55:27.367]  I wasn't there.
[01:55:28.028 --> 01:55:33.430]  A family member worked there and gave me all this information.
[01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:34.751]  And I have some papers also.
[01:55:35.611 --> 01:55:39.773]  I wanted to see if I could tackle to you or email him.
[01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:45.835]  Yes, email him to RobD at InfoWars.com and CC him to Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:45.855 --> 01:55:47.316]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:55:49.957 --> 01:55:52.340]  Let's talk to Cheyenne in Texas.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.021]  You're on the air, Cheyenne.
[01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:54.682]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:55.703 --> 01:55:59.867]  Thank you, Alex, and Mr. Tarpley, love you too.
[01:56:00.087 --> 01:56:01.528]  Alex, you're the greatest.
[01:56:01.909 --> 01:56:03.570]  I just wanted to say a few things real quick.
[01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:04.371]  I know I'm out of time.
[01:56:04.711 --> 01:56:14.100]  I called into the New York City precinct that is holding Luke, and I tried to explain to them that they were, you know,
[01:56:15.208 --> 01:56:21.350]  They gave an oath to take care of the Constitution and the cop hung up on me.
[01:56:22.131 --> 01:56:23.711]  Secondly, my friend called me.
[01:56:23.851 --> 01:56:25.892]  I'm originally from the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:35.856]  She called me and let me know that a cop friend of hers from there said there are military training exercises going on at the
[01:56:37.106 --> 01:56:38.327]  It's called Traders Village.
[01:56:38.767 --> 01:56:40.908]  It's like a big thing, you know, you can trade at.
[01:56:41.308 --> 01:56:46.671]  She said there are military operations going on there and there are tanks out in front of that place right now.
[01:56:46.771 --> 01:56:52.534]  It does have fencing and barbed wire set up, which has freaked her out.
[01:56:53.595 --> 01:56:58.378]  And she said that she is going to the tea party there in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on the 15th.
[01:57:00.165 --> 01:57:04.568]  Let me be clear, it's in mainstream news, the Obama Deception, thank you, hand them out.
[01:57:04.948 --> 01:57:12.393]  The mainstream news admits, admits, that they're putting regular military in all the intelligence departments and police departments.
[01:57:12.753 --> 01:57:16.815]  This is the covert takeover and they're announcing regular army on the streets of America.
[01:57:16.855 --> 01:57:22.439]  This is the bankers' checkmate to make sure the American people never bring the bankers to justice and they prevail.
[01:57:22.499 --> 01:57:23.239]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:23.299 --> 01:57:24.040]  In closing, Webster,
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:27.463]  What do you think about the fact that the military admits they're now spying on me?
[01:57:27.503 --> 01:57:28.525]  We got their own documents.
[01:57:28.865 --> 01:57:33.991]  And in the Fed protest, with Ron Paul and others, we're just there protesting the private Federal Reserve doing this to us.
[01:57:34.311 --> 01:57:35.773]  And we're not allowed to do that as Americans.
[01:57:35.833 --> 01:57:37.815]  The documents say we may be terrorists.
[01:57:38.695 --> 01:58:05.556]  It's uh... it's outrageous and of course it's this neo-mccarthyite hysteria you know in the old days they did red scares and all the rest of it uh... woodrow wilson was one of the worst at the last time we had a professor in the white house he was a warmonger and he promoted the dictatorship at home and i think that's uh... that's what you have with obama and by the way it can happen here nine percent of the time in history you get a tyranny you get a martial law look at all the third world nations look at russia look at china
[01:58:06.056 --> 01:58:07.077]  We are going to fight it, though.
[01:58:07.097 --> 01:58:07.797]  We're going to resist it.
[01:58:07.837 --> 01:58:09.959]  By the way, the Obama Deception is free on the internet.
[01:58:10.019 --> 01:58:11.620]  Google the Obama Deception.
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.942]  The second or third link says, Obama Deception in high quality.
[01:58:15.302 --> 01:58:16.543]  That's the one you want to see.
[01:58:16.863 --> 01:58:18.044]  And email it out to everybody.
[01:58:18.064 --> 01:58:19.645]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:19.865 --> 01:58:20.705]  Great job, crew.
[01:58:20.745 --> 01:58:21.766]  Great job, Lester.
[01:58:21.786 --> 01:58:23.227]  God bless you all!

[01:58:53.061 --> 01:59:02.327]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:59:02.387 --> 01:59:03.128]  This capitalism?
[01:59:03.188 --> 01:59:09.332]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:59:09.452 --> 01:59:10.233]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[01:59:23.782 --> 01:59:25.643]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:59:25.763 --> 01:59:32.469]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:59:32.730 --> 01:59:40.897]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:59:41.137 --> 01:59:46.862]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:59:47.022 --> 01:59:48.804]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:59:48.865 --> 01:59:51.028]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:59:51.048 --> 01:59:55.414]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
