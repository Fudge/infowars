[00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:06.195]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:07.957]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:09.718]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.320]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.861]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:17.046]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:21.109]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.111]  Alright folks, we are live and we're streaming live on PrisonPlanet.tv as well.
[00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:27.832]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:34.474]  We're going to have Bob Dacey in studio in about 90 minutes and Bob Chapman will be joining us later in the program.
[00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:36.835]  Alex set to call in.
[00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:42.497]  Top story, we've got Joseph Pitts, a representative, congressman.
[00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:45.698]  Out of Pennsylvania, on the house floor.
[00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:47.379]  Now, I've been going through a ton of footage.
[00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.920]  I gotta be honest, I haven't been listening to the show lately.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.162]  I've just been doing so much work, not only on my movie, but working on Obama 2, which is just shaping up to be a masterpiece.
[00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:57.502]  Just an unbelievable picture.
[00:00:57.502 --> 00:01:00.423]  I really hope people get out there and support it like they did the first one.
[00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:12.228]  Let's support it 10 times over, because I think that this movie is going to be even stronger as we go through more and more footage, more and more current events, and are really able to analyze it for you in a way that only a movie can do.
[00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:13.989]  Unfortunately, people don't read.
[00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:15.090]  It doesn't have the big effect.
[00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.875]  So, like I said, haven't been listening to the show, but Pitts on the floor calling out the eugenics program of population control.
[00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.655]  Let me repeat that.
[00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:31.260]  Calling out the eugenics program of population control and calling out Judge Ginsburg on her eugenics comments.
[00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:33.917]  And I really wanted to show people the video.
[00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:37.699]  I'm really liking these one-minute speeches lately.
[00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:50.405]  There was a clip we just pulled for the Obama Deception, where I think it's Lundgren, is talking about the elites and them using, again, global warming as a tool to control the population, because that's what it is.
[00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:57.629]  Really talking about their fear-mongering, saying, oh, in 92 or 96 months, which is the equivalent of eight years, the world is going to end.
[00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:58.970]  He talks about Prince Charles.
[00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:06.483]  And this royalty, this bourgeoisie, this elite that, again, want to control us through the fear of global warming.
[00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:10.003]  I mean, this climate bill is out of control.
[00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:10.864]  It's over the top.
[00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:24.507]  This health care bill, which really does tie into Pitts' comments about eugenics, where they're stating that they can have interventions in private homes, interventions that they're going to knock on your door and say, take the shot or go to jail.
[00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:29.792]  Now, this is unheard of, and it's going to be federally funded.
[00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:33.675]  In fact, I have subsections of the bill that I'm really just going to have to read.
[00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.819]  I mean, Title 3 of the bill is entitled, Improving the Health of the American People.
[00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.100]  It includes four subtitles.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.524]  They are, A, modernizing disease prevention of public health systems.
[00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:46.987]  B, increase access to clinical preventive services.
[00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:49.129]  Preventive services.
[00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.330]  C, creating healthier communities.
[00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:52.874]  Healthier communities.
[00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:56.505]  That means you're a bad neighbor if you don't take the shots.
[00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:59.354]  If your kids don't take the shots, maybe you can't live in the neighborhood anymore.
[00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:05.828]  And of course, D, support for prevention and public health information.
[00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:09.049]  And then it tells you in, which subsection is it right here?
[00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:21.712]  There's eight specific methods, and in section E, E, providing for home visits that promote immunization through education, assessments of need, referrals, provision of immunations, and other services.
[00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:24.073]  This says they can come into your home.
[00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:27.254]  Big stories over at PrisonPlanetInfoWars.com
[00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:28.475]  Right now.
[00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:32.377]  So on the other side, we're going to watch Joseph Pitts really call out this eugenics program.
[00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:33.658]  And that's what it is.
[00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:37.301]  And they are gearing up for it in a way never before seen.
[00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.782]  In fact, you know, this is the other top story.
[00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:45.046]  Fox News is now retracting their story on these robots feeding on biomass.
[00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:48.088]  Remember, the headline was could feed on dead bodies.
[00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:49.349]  Could feed on dead bodies.
[00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.810]  Well now, they're saying they're vegetarian!
[00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.731]  You can't even get the article cached!
[00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.692]  Here it is right here.
[00:03:56.692 --> 00:03:58.853]  They've got the link, so we'll bring that up on the other side as well.
[00:03:58.853 --> 00:04:04.455]  But Biomass Entities Military Robot is a vegetarian, company says.
[00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:07.757]  Because they know it's an open war crime if you're clearing the battlefields.
[00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:12.273]  Or the death fields from some kind of eugenics program.
[00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:15.939]  Some genocide with robots that are eating biomass.
[00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.504]  They're literally feeding on the dead to survive.
[00:04:19.504 --> 00:04:21.588]  How sick is that?
[00:04:21.588 --> 00:04:23.270]  And we're gonna use them as a military tool?
[00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.802]  No, we gotta soften it for the public.
[00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:28.284]  That story about dead bodies, that was a mistake.
[00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:30.266]  They're vegetarians.
[00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:31.387]  Vegetarians.
[00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:32.948]  You don't think we live in 1984?
[00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:35.110]  This is the definition of 1984.
[00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.612]  I couldn't pull up a cached article.
[00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:38.553]  There's no reference.
[00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:39.494]  I mean, come on.
[00:04:39.494 --> 00:04:41.375]  Give me a break.
[00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:45.079]  This eater robot is evil.
[00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:45.919]  Evil.
[00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.620]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.481]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:51.124]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:04.372]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.373]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:14.901]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:20.445]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.067]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:05:22.307 --> 00:05:28.809]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:39.874]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:40.634]  That's right.
[00:05:40.634 --> 00:05:43.195]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:44.795]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:05:46.736 --> 00:05:47.357]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:07.364]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:13.251]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:19.399]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:21.700]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.161]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:37.345]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:39.026]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:40.887]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:47.129]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:56.072]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.072 --> 00:06:57.635]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:58.817]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:03.411]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?

[00:07:15.422 --> 00:07:16.403]  Be safe.
[00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:19.006]  Trust Pepperspray instead of your luck.

[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.140]  I'm good.
[00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:08.668]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.668 --> 00:08:12.510]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:28.218]  Alright folks, we are back live streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com right now, and I'm going to play this clip of Joseph Pitts, a representative out of Pennsylvania, really calling out the elite eugenics program, and Ginsburg, Judge Ginsburg, in particular.
[00:08:28.218 --> 00:08:29.379]  So let's go to the clip right now.
[00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:34.348]  Thank you.
[00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.831]  For what purpose is a gentleman from Pennsylvania?
[00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:37.832]  Gentleman's recognized.
[00:08:37.832 --> 00:08:44.618]  Mr. Speaker, last week's New York Times Magazine featured an interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:49.763]  Some of her comments were absolutely astonishing, coming from a sitting Supreme Court Justice.
[00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:53.486]  But the most disturbing comment came in reference to abortion.
[00:08:53.486 --> 00:08:57.450]  In reference to Roe v. Wade, the infamous Supreme Court case, she said this.
[00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:58.150]  Quote,
[00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.833]  Not race, religion, or socioeconomic background.
[00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:41.862]  I am shocked that a member of the Supreme Court believes that a compelling reason for the legality of abortion is because our society wants to reduce the growth of specific populations.
[00:09:41.862 --> 00:09:47.346]  Justice Ginsburg's comments are an assault and insult to the values of the American people.
[00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:47.766]  I yield back.
[00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.290]  Exactly.
[00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.871]  All men are created equal.
[00:09:55.871 --> 00:10:03.756]  You should not be debasing any population based on race, creed, economic situation.
[00:10:03.756 --> 00:10:05.257]  It's absolutely ludicrous.
[00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.107]  You know, you can come up from nothing, folks.
[00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.287]  You just have to believe in yourself.
[00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:11.088]  You have to work towards a goal.
[00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:19.751]  You gotta stop sitting on your hands and why me and crying and eating bonbons on the couch watching Jerry Springer and Ellen all day.
[00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:21.672]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[00:10:21.672 --> 00:10:23.213]  Get off your duff and do something.
[00:10:23.213 --> 00:10:25.694]  There are so many victories that we've had.
[00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:27.914]  There have been some losses lately, by the way.
[00:10:27.914 --> 00:10:28.735]  I mean, big time.
[00:10:28.735 --> 00:10:31.336]  Oh, they'll never pass the climate bill.
[00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:31.736]  They did it.
[00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:33.626]  Now it's going to the Senate.
[00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:34.707]  Oh, it'll never pass in the Senate.
[00:10:34.707 --> 00:10:37.629]  Well, if we don't do something, it's gonna pass in the Senate.
[00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:46.455]  Oh, they'll never bring in a judge who openly writes a book called America's Deadly Obsession and no one will call her out on it.
[00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:52.519]  A book that literally says that we don't have a Second Amendment and only the military should have firearms.
[00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:59.484]  And nobody says anything on the floor while she's going to be the next Supreme Court Justice?
[00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:00.525]  They're just gonna confirm her?
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.361]  It looks like it's on a fast track and they want to keep going to that, uh, wise Latina woman.
[00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:06.662]  All right.
[00:11:06.662 --> 00:11:20.506]  Well, if you're going to go to the wise Latina woman comment, why don't you take it the step further, the step that needs to be taken and say, wait a minute, what's really disturbing is you're a member of La Raza, but not just a member, a council member, which is an organization solely based on race.
[00:11:22.756 --> 00:11:24.498]  You know, I'm all for this, let's come together.
[00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:26.440]  Again, I'm not for eugenics.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.202]  I don't want to see any race wiped out.
[00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:36.252]  I think it's unbelievable, the thought that I'm superior to somebody because of the way I look.
[00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:38.634]  My physical attributes.
[00:11:38.634 --> 00:11:41.097]  I mean, could you be more ignorant than that?
[00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:42.499]  Than to believe something like that?
[00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:45.240]  But no, she believes it.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.841]  That's the thing.
[00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.922]  And no one, no one is stepping up to the plate.
[00:11:47.922 --> 00:11:49.263]  No one's asking the tough question.
[00:11:49.263 --> 00:11:51.685]  And the tougher question is the Second Amendment question, folks.
[00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:53.206]  And she is, she's just going to get it.
[00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:58.711]  Look, I'm going to take calls based on this eugenics comment and the Eater robots.
[00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:00.672]  That's pretty much what I want to stick to right now.
[00:12:00.672 --> 00:12:06.256]  Do a little bit of a news blitz and we'll take your calls at the 20 marker and the 20 after marker.
[00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:08.038]  House panel passes health bills.
[00:12:08.038 --> 00:12:09.739]  Critics slam cost.
[00:12:09.739 --> 00:12:12.461]  See, this is going to cost us all sorts of money.
[00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:13.162]  Again, as
[00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:17.914]  The economy crashes as there are less and less jobs.
[00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:20.096]  As there are no more benefits.
[00:12:20.096 --> 00:12:22.098]  As they begin to take your house away.
[00:12:22.098 --> 00:12:24.801]  They are going to jack the cost up of health care.
[00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:26.723]  They are going to jack the cost up
[00:12:28.641 --> 00:12:30.562]  of your home based on this climate bill.
[00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:32.143]  They're going to come in and say, you know what?
[00:12:32.143 --> 00:12:33.723]  You're not electricity efficient.
[00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:34.804]  This is going to be on your dime.
[00:12:34.804 --> 00:12:36.685]  You have such and such a time period to fix it.
[00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:37.825]  If you don't, you're going to be heavily taxed.
[00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:39.446]  We're going to take your house away.
[00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:45.569]  And then they're going to up the price of energy so that once you do make the changes, you're still going to be paying three to four times more.
[00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:47.209]  It's the open plan.
[00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:50.311]  It's something we discuss on the show.
[00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.572]  And they're saying over a trillion dollars.
[00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:54.633]  Over a trill.
[00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:56.033]  But I mean, it's not real money.
[00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:57.134]  They just print it out of nowhere.
[00:12:58.112 --> 00:12:59.954]  Meanwhile, they can now have home interventions!
[00:12:59.954 --> 00:13:00.675]  No big deal!
[00:13:00.675 --> 00:13:02.978]  Home interventions for the swine flu!
[00:13:02.978 --> 00:13:07.903]  And by the way, this one's out of the Guardian, this is UK, but I try to keep a global look.
[00:13:08.697 --> 00:13:08.957]  I don't
[00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.733]  They're going to start with the schools, just like here.
[00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:33.614]  Catherine Sebelius is on record.
[00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:35.275]  That's the head of Health and Human Services.
[00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:37.296]  For those that don't know, just look into it.
[00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:42.078]  They are going to make your kid's school a mass vaccination center, so they get the kiddies first.
[00:13:42.078 --> 00:13:44.819]  Then the parents have to come in and get their kids.
[00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:45.780]  Oh, do you have your shot?
[00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.612]  Oh, well, you've got to make an appointment too.
[00:13:48.612 --> 00:13:50.254]  We need to keep tabs on you as well.
[00:13:50.254 --> 00:13:57.061]  But in Canada, they've already figured out that the 18 to 30 crowd isn't going to go for it because they're too busy drinking and having fun and not caring.
[00:13:57.061 --> 00:13:57.661]  So what are they going to do?
[00:13:57.661 --> 00:14:00.905]  They're going to go to where they're drinking and having fun and not caring.
[00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:01.445]  That's right.
[00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:06.150]  They're going to make makeshift vaccination centers out of the bar.
[00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.691]  That's right.
[00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:07.712]  At a bar strip.
[00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:14.884]  How dangerous is it to inject toxins into somebody's body while they're inebriated on alcohol?
[00:14:14.884 --> 00:14:16.425]  And God knows what else.
[00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.086]  But that's the loving government for you.
[00:14:18.086 --> 00:14:19.147]  That's what they're going to do.
[00:14:19.147 --> 00:14:22.870]  And then I guess the people that they can't get through all these different programs, it's going to be the old knock.
[00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.393]  Hey, did you take that three mandatory shot?
[00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:34.259]  But meanwhile they have to fearmonger that this is going to shut down schools, this is going to shut down work, this is going to hurt the economy.
[00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:37.841]  Swine flu may keep some schools shut in September.
[00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:43.084]  Uncertainty over the spread of pandemic could keep pupils away at start of autumn term.
[00:14:44.332 --> 00:14:48.573]  Some schools in England could remain closed in September if the swine flu pandemic escalates over the summer.
[00:14:48.573 --> 00:14:48.993]  See, it won't.
[00:14:48.993 --> 00:14:52.674]  What will happen is they'll say, man, we just beat it.
[00:14:52.674 --> 00:14:53.794]  And now the kids are coming in.
[00:14:53.794 --> 00:15:01.296]  Let's let's nip this swine flu thing in the bud before it gets cold and it comes flu season.
[00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:04.317]  So again, they have to fear monger right now.
[00:15:04.317 --> 00:15:04.557]  But.
[00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:09.271]  They're building the infrastructure where every kid is going to have to take this shot.
[00:15:09.271 --> 00:15:10.772]  I'm warning parents out there.
[00:15:10.772 --> 00:15:14.974]  I mean, if there's one thing I tell people with kids, and I've been doing it.
[00:15:14.974 --> 00:15:17.895]  In fact, my landlord was over yesterday.
[00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:19.376]  He was replacing my dryer.
[00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:22.858]  He had his son with him and his grandson, actually.
[00:15:22.858 --> 00:15:27.020]  And I said, look, if there's one thing I can tell you, it's don't take the swine flu shot.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.300]  Don't.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.281]  You got a family, man.
[00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:29.461]  Don't let your kids take it.
[00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:31.602]  It's a bad, bad idea.
[00:15:31.602 --> 00:15:32.823]  What do you mean it's a bad idea?
[00:15:32.823 --> 00:15:33.243]  I'm like, well, 1976.
[00:15:35.357 --> 00:15:45.704]  60 Minutes in 79 had to do a story that in 76, when they injected people with the swine flu vaccinations, it caused mass paralysis and death.
[00:15:45.704 --> 00:15:47.525]  I'm not sure which I'd rather have.
[00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:48.165]  Actually, I am sure.
[00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:51.708]  I'd probably rather die than be a quadriplegic.
[00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:53.529]  That's no offense to quadriplegics out there.
[00:15:53.529 --> 00:16:01.534]  I know we've got a ton listening, I'm sure, or people that'll be offended, but I cannot imagine having to go through life without the use of my arms and legs
[00:16:02.912 --> 00:16:06.635]  Because the elite run a eugenics program where they're poisoning the population.
[00:16:06.635 --> 00:16:11.139]  And they made me take a shot that I obviously didn't need.
[00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:14.141]  And then they hype up the amount of deaths from swine flu.
[00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.862]  Remember the first couple deaths?
[00:16:15.862 --> 00:16:17.604]  First of all, it was piggy flu.
[00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:18.925]  And it had come from Mexico.
[00:16:18.925 --> 00:16:20.946]  But then they couldn't find any pigs with it in Mexico.
[00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:23.929]  Then the story came out weeks later after they said it was from Mexico.
[00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:27.632]  No, well actually it was a pig in Canada from a Mexican migrant worker.
[00:16:28.703 --> 00:16:30.904]  No proof, just a story.
[00:16:30.904 --> 00:16:31.864]  Zero proof.
[00:16:31.864 --> 00:16:44.708]  Meanwhile, the first person that dies in the United States from swine flu, and I haven't seen a pandemic, I haven't seen people with masks on, I haven't seen people getting extra sick, was a two-year-old boy who was from Mexico, wasn't even a U.S.
[00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:51.410]  citizen, had all these health problems beforehand, had been in and out of hospitals his whole life, and may have had
[00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.706]  This swine flu, which is really three types of flu.
[00:16:54.706 --> 00:16:59.269]  It is one part bird flu, two parts swine flu, one part human flu.
[00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.069]  Look it up.
[00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:01.490]  Regular.
[00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.811]  I mean, that is open.
[00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:05.152]  I mean, I think that's even on Wikipedia.
[00:17:05.152 --> 00:17:11.156]  But by this time, so many people are brainwashed that this comes from pigs and they're gonna have to slaughter all sorts of animals because of it.
[00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.598]  You tell that to the normal person, they're like, no, man.
[00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:14.859]  You see that all-star game?
[00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.520]  Obama can sure pitch a ball.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.201]  Threw that ball real good.
[00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:19.982]  Like my president.
[00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:23.121]  Alright, let's jump to some other news.
[00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:25.982]  Mark Cuban insider trading case thrown out.
[00:17:25.982 --> 00:17:29.584]  This is out of Reuters, but we have a story over at Infowars.com right now.
[00:17:29.584 --> 00:17:39.107]  That's right, Mark Cuban had been threatened with insider trading in Texas after one of these guys started threatening because he was thinking about funding the loose change project.
[00:17:39.107 --> 00:17:42.688]  And they had a big email exchange and then they said, you know, we're going to do it anyway.
[00:17:43.968 --> 00:17:44.328]  A U.S.
[00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:50.114]  court judge threw out insider trading case against Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner Mark Cuban on Friday but gave the U.S.
[00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:53.317]  Securities and Exchange Commission a month to file an amended lawsuit.
[00:17:54.278 --> 00:18:06.809]  Cuban, listed by Forbes Magazine as one of the 400 richest Americans, faced civil charges that he acted on non-public information when he sold his stake in internet search engine company Mama.com to avoid more than a $750,000 loss.
[00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:07.029]  U.S.
[00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:13.754]  District Judge Sidney Fitzwater gave the SEC 30 days to file an amended complaint.
[00:18:13.754 --> 00:18:20.260]  If the SEC can allege that Cuban undertook a duty expressly or implicitly, see this is for three quarters of a million dollars.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.482]  And this is a pretty honest guy.
[00:18:22.482 --> 00:18:25.464]  This is a guy that does put out cutting edge products.
[00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:30.648]  You know, Magnolia Pictures, you know, not everything they do is great, but at least they're challenging the system.
[00:18:30.648 --> 00:18:33.431]  And they're worried about three quarters of a million dollars.
[00:18:33.431 --> 00:18:36.933]  We got people stealing trillions right now.
[00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:37.554]  Let me repeat that.
[00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:40.216]  We got people stealing trillions.
[00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:43.619]  Trillions while you struggle to make your house payment.
[00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:48.223]  While you're still overpaying for gas, even at what it's like 240 right now.
[00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:48.643]  It shouldn't be 240.
[00:18:50.123 --> 00:18:51.403]  And you know, I got a clip on that.
[00:18:51.403 --> 00:18:55.164]  I don't know if it's going to make the new Obama film, but we got a representative going there.
[00:18:55.164 --> 00:18:57.125]  You know, what is up with this?
[00:18:57.125 --> 00:19:00.606]  It's like the supply is up.
[00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:02.206]  The demand is lower.
[00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:04.107]  We should be paying a lot less.
[00:19:04.107 --> 00:19:05.507]  What's going on here?
[00:19:05.507 --> 00:19:07.128]  Is this a little price gouging?
[00:19:07.128 --> 00:19:08.088]  A little collusion?
[00:19:08.088 --> 00:19:08.568]  I wonder.
[00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:14.128]  These guys are still making hand over fist in every aspect.
[00:19:14.128 --> 00:19:16.328]  The wars are still happening in the Middle East.
[00:19:16.328 --> 00:19:18.149]  In fact, we got a bombing in the Middle East right now.
[00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:23.211]  I'm sure it's going to be blamed on Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda-like cells or terrorists or insurgents.
[00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:24.871]  It's over in Indonesia.
[00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:28.413]  In fact, I'm sure right now on the news,
[00:19:29.173 --> 00:19:31.394]  They're saying it's Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:31.394 --> 00:19:32.755]  I just have a prediction.
[00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:36.138]  Right now we're taping C-SPAN so I won't know for sure.
[00:19:36.138 --> 00:19:40.260]  But I'm sure it's Al-Qaeda because bombs have ripped through Indonesian hotels.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.141]  Must be Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:43.382]  We're going to take your calls on the other side.
[00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:44.863]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:44.863 --> 00:19:46.444]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:19:46.444 --> 00:19:50.026]  More news after this and a ton of stories over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:07.899]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:20:07.899 --> 00:20:23.811]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:29.474]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:20:29.474 --> 00:20:35.998]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:20:35.998 --> 00:20:39.901]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:42.583]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:47.946]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:20:48.266 --> 00:20:50.927]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:20:50.927 --> 00:20:53.147]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.

[00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.150]  A new world order.
[00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:10.012]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:21:10.012 --> 00:21:12.872]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:12.872 --> 00:21:14.993]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:15.663 --> 00:21:18.826]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:18.826 --> 00:21:26.154]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:29.175 --> 00:21:34.619]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:38.501]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:41.063]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:41.063 --> 00:21:42.224]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:43.004]  They're not after money.
[00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:44.285]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:44.285 --> 00:21:45.266]  They're after power.
[00:21:45.266 --> 00:21:46.427]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:22:59.617 --> 00:23:06.944]  If the current state of the economy is severely impacting your life, this might be some of the most important information you will ever hear.
[00:23:06.944 --> 00:23:14.931]  As the economy continues to spiral out of control, many people, just like you, wonder how they will support their family and pay their bills.
[00:23:14.931 --> 00:23:18.595]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it.
[00:23:18.595 --> 00:23:21.858]  It's time for you to look outside the box and change your life.
[00:23:22.398 --> 00:23:31.261]  If you're tired of the get-rich-quick schemes, if you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck, if you're tired of being tired, you need to pick up Robert Beatle's new book.
[00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:33.402]  And it's called, Here's What You Do.
[00:23:33.402 --> 00:23:35.282]  Yes, Here's What You Do.
[00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:41.084]  This 72-page book will show you what you need to do to make the best of an economy that's in the middle of a recession.
[00:23:41.084 --> 00:23:42.024]  And the best part?
[00:23:42.024 --> 00:23:45.285]  This revolutionary book is priced under $10 and is only $6 for the e-book.
[00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:50.048]  Here's what you do to get Here's What You Do.

[00:23:52.209 --> 00:23:54.391]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:56.392]  Here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:23:56.392 --> 00:23:58.554]  And start changing your life today.
[00:23:58.554 --> 00:24:13.024]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[00:24:13.024 --> 00:24:16.887]  About a lucky man who made the grade.
[00:24:19.147 --> 00:24:22.929]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:23.809]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:25.130]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.571]  We're going to go to your calls in a moment.
[00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:31.053]  At 9.30 after, we're going to take more calls, rip through some of this news.
[00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:33.775]  But bombs ripped through Indonesian hotels, killing eight.
[00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:44.140]  Bombs ripped through two luxury hotels in the heart of Indonesia's capital on Friday, killing eight people and wounding dozens in an attack the president said would damage confidence in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:58.911]  Suicide bombers struck the JW Marriott Hotel and close by Ritz Carlton, both popular with visiting international businessmen and boasting some of the tightest security in Jakarta, as guests sat down for a breakfast power meeting.
[00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:04.055]  So to me, it's going to be pretty interesting to see who was killed in this, who was targeted, and who they blame.
[00:25:04.055 --> 00:25:08.339]  And again, they blame Al-Qaeda for everything, so I don't think this is going to be much of an exception.
[00:25:08.339 --> 00:25:11.841]  Alright, let's go to our first caller, John in Washington.
[00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:12.462]  John, you're on the air.
[00:25:14.278 --> 00:25:15.559]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:16.660]  Good.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:25.606]  Listen, I got some information about those Eater robots, and it kind of surprised me, actually.
[00:25:25.606 --> 00:25:40.055]  My wife is a distributor for electronics components, and when I told her about this story after work the other day, she goes, oh, that doesn't sound right.
[00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:41.917]  And I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:42.517]  She goes, well,
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:50.846]  She knows Mr. Finkelstein at RTI because apparently they've done business through her company before.
[00:25:50.846 --> 00:25:52.707]  So she calls him.
[00:25:52.707 --> 00:25:55.849]  And he was quite candid about it.
[00:25:55.849 --> 00:26:09.900]  And what it comes down to is that, in electronics and these R&D projects, they have what they call software, then they have firmware, then they have hardware, and then they have what's called vaporware.
[00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:18.611]  Vaporware are wishful ideas, ideas about things that they wish they could do or want to do sometime.
[00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:32.795]  He said, or he told my wife, that there are no Eater Robots that are operative, there are none under construction, there are no contracts for them, and at this point it's vaporware.
[00:26:32.795 --> 00:26:35.636]  So what this implies to me, because this came out
[00:26:36.238 --> 00:26:42.125]  And the media was carried and has been talked about on the internet and so forth created a buzz.
[00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:46.029]  It's one of those stories that they like to feed out to the public.
[00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:56.474]  So they can draw people's attention away, kind of hype people up, perhaps make some people a little fearful of the government or how they're doing things.
[00:26:56.474 --> 00:26:57.434]  But I would also say this.
[00:26:57.434 --> 00:26:59.515]  This technology isn't that off the realm.
[00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:01.296]  It's kind of almost a beta test.
[00:27:01.296 --> 00:27:05.619]  I mean, again, we just found out two weeks ago the Nazis had the stealth bomber.
[00:27:05.619 --> 00:27:06.739]  I mean, think about how long.
[00:27:06.739 --> 00:27:11.802]  That's why I can't stand it when people always tell me, oh, they could never lie about something for so long.
[00:27:12.122 --> 00:27:16.805]  We just waited 60 plus years to find out that the Nazis had the stealth bomber.
[00:27:16.805 --> 00:27:18.025]  They had the technology.
[00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:20.107]  I mean, what was the official story before that?
[00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:23.028]  That we developed it in the 70s through Skunk Works?
[00:27:23.028 --> 00:27:26.731]  And then we had it in the late 70s with our model?
[00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:27.331]  I mean, come on!
[00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:44.700]  So to me this may be quote-unquote vaporware or only be modeled in a computer or maybe they've only made one or two models but it's scary to me because I have seen the actual live models the things that are on the battlefield right now such as the big dog you know we should bring a video up with a big dog of the Robo Snake
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.240]  Hey!
[00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:10.491]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:11.092]  Hello?
[00:28:11.092 --> 00:28:12.192]  Yes, you're on the air.
[00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:13.913]  Hey, well, thanks.
[00:28:13.913 --> 00:28:17.955]  Those robotic things, I think it's not vaporware.
[00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:22.458]  I mean, like you said, they got the fish, they got the Israel snake, they got...
[00:28:23.482 --> 00:28:27.343]  They got a, you know, it's AI, GPS, man, that's what it's for.
[00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:33.584]  And they just announced, too, that they were going to be using small hummingbird-like insects that would be remote-controlled by people.
[00:28:33.584 --> 00:28:38.965]  There was some suspicion that they were spying on protesters a little over a year ago in D.C.
[00:28:38.965 --> 00:28:42.826]  with these things, but now they're just openly saying, yeah, we got them.
[00:28:42.826 --> 00:28:43.346]  Yeah.
[00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:47.587]  Well, people can do their own research and find out that Hitler had the Hannibal II.
[00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:50.342]  They can look that up on the internet if they like.
[00:28:50.342 --> 00:28:50.983]  Google that.
[00:28:50.983 --> 00:28:55.305]  But in that article it said they would gobble up whatever organic material they could find.
[00:28:55.305 --> 00:28:58.147]  Grass, wood, old furniture, even dead bodies.
[00:28:58.147 --> 00:28:58.848]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:58.848 --> 00:29:03.831]  And it is weird now that you can't even get the cached article.
[00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:04.592]  It's very odd to me.
[00:29:04.592 --> 00:29:05.112]  And you know what?
[00:29:05.112 --> 00:29:11.276]  The guy in RTI, maybe he's only seen a couple models and he doesn't know that maybe they're in mass production.
[00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:13.578]  But the bottom line is, again, I mean, look at the XM-24.
[00:29:14.478 --> 00:29:17.620]  Look at this new weapon that the military is going to be wielding.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:29.167]  It has a smart chip in a bullet that allows the bullet to curve around to get the target, go around buildings, go through buildings, and then explode like a grenade within three feet of its target and kill everybody.
[00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.829]  You know, this is a smart bullet, and it has heat sensors.
[00:29:31.829 --> 00:29:34.931]  It's something out of a science fiction movie, but it's fact now.
[00:29:34.931 --> 00:29:36.572]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:36.572 --> 00:29:39.093]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:29:39.093 --> 00:29:41.975]  Top stories over at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:41.975 --> 00:29:43.076]  Your calls on the other side.
[00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:54.750]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.128 --> 00:30:01.509]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:03.510]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.490]  Well, you should.
[00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.972]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:30:08.972 --> 00:30:09.793]  That's right.
[00:30:09.793 --> 00:30:18.457]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:30:18.457 --> 00:30:19.797]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:30:19.797 --> 00:30:20.938]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:30:21.158 --> 00:30:27.141]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:30:27.141 --> 00:30:34.024]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:30:34.024 --> 00:30:39.546]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:41.007]  This is real.
[00:30:41.007 --> 00:30:42.067]  Don't miss out.
[00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:48.930]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.611]  And get your free handgun.
[00:30:50.611 --> 00:30:52.974]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:30:52.974 --> 00:30:56.677]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:30:56.677 --> 00:30:59.600]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:31:01.198 --> 00:31:07.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.582]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:20.744]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.184 --> 00:31:23.144]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:25.645]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.645 --> 00:31:37.228]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.888]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.888 --> 00:31:40.749]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.749 --> 00:31:47.010]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.595 --> 00:32:04.204]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:04.204 --> 00:32:09.548]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.548 --> 00:32:11.589]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.589 --> 00:32:16.352]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.732 --> 00:32:17.753]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.753 --> 00:32:18.874]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.874 --> 00:32:20.776]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.776 --> 00:32:21.837]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.837 --> 00:32:24.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.381]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:26.923]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.923 --> 00:32:32.188]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:32.188 --> 00:32:35.332]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.752 --> 00:32:39.573]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.573 --> 00:32:40.793]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.793 --> 00:32:41.693]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:42.814]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.814 --> 00:32:43.734]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:44.834]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.834 --> 00:32:47.875]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:49.655]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:50.575]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:05.293]  Get up, stand up!
[00:33:05.293 --> 00:33:08.456]  Stand up for your right!
[00:33:08.456 --> 00:33:09.638]  Get up, stand up!
[00:33:17.165 --> 00:33:17.925]  We are back.
[00:33:17.925 --> 00:33:18.806]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.806 --> 00:33:20.126]  I am Jason Dermus sitting in.
[00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:25.588]  By the way, my show, The Info Warrior, will be starting on Sunday after the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:26.508]  That's 6 p.m.
[00:33:26.508 --> 00:33:27.528]  Central Time.
[00:33:27.528 --> 00:33:35.210]  Not this Sunday, but next Sunday when I get back from this California trip where I'll be shooting for the Obama Deception 2 and my new film, Invisible Empire.
[00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.291]  Before we go back to your calls...
[00:33:37.151 --> 00:33:42.214]  I just want to take this time to thank some of our great sponsors that actually make this show possible.
[00:33:42.214 --> 00:33:43.795]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:33:43.795 --> 00:33:45.836]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:33:45.836 --> 00:33:46.556]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:46.556 --> 00:33:50.618]  Okay, so we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[00:33:50.618 --> 00:33:56.041]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[00:33:56.041 --> 00:33:57.542]  They also happen to be true patriots.
[00:33:57.822 --> 00:33:58.062]  I don't know.
[00:34:20.003 --> 00:34:27.071]  They also have this thing called Street View and a virtual tour so you can really look at the properties that they have on HomeGain.com.
[00:34:27.071 --> 00:34:30.255]  That's H-O-M-E G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:34:31.283 --> 00:34:33.725]  Alright, let's go back to callers.
[00:34:33.725 --> 00:34:39.348]  And while I'm doing this, I want to show you some of these robots I've been talking about over at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.970]  Let's bring up, who do we have?
[00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:42.270]  Let's show them the Big Dog.
[00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.493]  You know, because now we have the Big Dog, we have the Ripsaw.
[00:34:45.493 --> 00:34:51.897]  The Ripsaw is essentially a tank with a .25 or .50 caliber mounted on top of it, and it is a weapon.
[00:34:51.897 --> 00:34:59.262]  Now, the Big Dog is there to carry weapons and whatnot, but it's very hard to disable, basically, because it kind of goes side to side.
[00:34:59.262 --> 00:35:00.663]  You can kick it, you can bounce it.
[00:35:01.523 --> 00:35:05.747]  And if you put a weapon on this thing, can you imagine how scary this thing looks?
[00:35:05.747 --> 00:35:09.190]  They call it the Big Dog because it kind of looks like a dog without a face.
[00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:18.277]  But here it is going through, you know, pretty rough terrain with probably, I'd say, a hundred or so pounds mounted on top of it, all this different equipment.
[00:35:18.277 --> 00:35:20.599]  All right, let's go to Dan in North Carolina.
[00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:22.340]  Dan, you're on the line.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.662]  Hey, Jason.
[00:35:24.662 --> 00:35:26.904]  Yeah, I know.
[00:35:26.904 --> 00:35:30.167]  I saw Big Dog quite a while ago, and that's really what's
[00:35:30.723 --> 00:35:41.574]  Kind of scary more than anything else because you look at it and you think about like the processor power they have to have in that thing for it to correct its movement, you know, when it's kicked and stuff.
[00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:52.005]  And they talked about, I was looking at articles and stuff, they're talking about putting technology on it that would be able to track like human heartbeat and human breath and stuff.
[00:35:52.005 --> 00:35:52.906]  So they're talking about
[00:35:53.331 --> 00:36:00.176]  Essentially an extremely mobile weapons platform that can track people and that just freaks me out more than anything.
[00:36:00.176 --> 00:36:13.945]  Well we live in a track and trace society and right now they're uh they're showing um that that's kind of virtual video of these robo penguins but before they were showing the robo penguins actually in the water with other penguins and that's just the society we live in.
[00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:20.009]  I mean we we now have the Census Bureau going from house to house and GPSing every single home.
[00:36:20.009 --> 00:36:22.991]  I just saw the latest version of Google Earth and oh my god
[00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:24.771]  It is just off the charts.
[00:36:24.771 --> 00:36:31.933]  I mean, how much longer until all of our houses are 3D modeled where you can get like a real-time zoom in?
[00:36:31.933 --> 00:36:35.413]  And this is something that not, you know, intelligence agencies don't have.
[00:36:35.413 --> 00:36:36.574]  The public has this.
[00:36:36.574 --> 00:36:42.055]  So we're really living in a society where we can almost track, trace, and surveil each other if we so desire.
[00:36:42.055 --> 00:36:43.795]  So you know that the government's doing it.
[00:36:43.795 --> 00:36:48.476]  You know it through the AT&T versus Heptin case that was thrown out in the beginning of June.
[00:36:48.956 --> 00:37:07.543]  You know, where they actually had to admit, let me say it again, they actually had to admit that they were tracking and tracing everything you do on your internet and cell phone with a standard line that would take all that information and store it on a hard drive where they would then run it through like Promise or Carnivore, all these software where it would be automated before it saw even human eyes.
[00:37:07.543 --> 00:37:14.486]  So, I mean, we are well beyond the pale of what 1984 wanted to be because we are in a technological super state
[00:37:15.106 --> 00:37:15.406]  That is
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.021]  I think it taught itself to do something.
[00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:46.586]  So, not only are these robotics, and that Einstein one looks really creepy, I told them to bring up Hanson Robotics, and there's a little panel on the side that says Robots, where they're trying to rebuild Philip K. Dick.
[00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:48.427]  They got a robot called Joey Chaos.
[00:37:48.427 --> 00:37:50.088]  All these different robotics.
[00:37:50.088 --> 00:37:51.669]  It is Terminator-esque.
[00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:58.038]  Let me say it again, it is Terminator-esque, but instead of the robots being in charge, the elite will be in charge.
[00:37:58.038 --> 00:38:00.159]  See, they're never really going to be fully automated.
[00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:00.740]  Hopefully.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.880]  I mean, that would be a nightmare amongst itself.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.761]  Harry in Michigan.
[00:38:03.761 --> 00:38:06.482]  Harry, you're on the line.
[00:38:06.482 --> 00:38:07.723]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:07.723 --> 00:38:08.603]  Uh, Jason?
[00:38:08.603 --> 00:38:09.603]  Yes.
[00:38:09.603 --> 00:38:10.224]  Is there?
[00:38:10.224 --> 00:38:11.784]  Ah, good to talk to you.
[00:38:11.784 --> 00:38:19.988]  Yeah, I'm a long-time listener and, uh, way before Alex started the show, uh, I was aware of all this and I'm 62 years old and, uh,
[00:38:20.888 --> 00:38:30.057]  And I think the world is in deep trouble, and the harder I try to pass the word, it seems like the further back I go.
[00:38:30.057 --> 00:38:36.624]  And I'm still trying to convince people of chemtrails, let alone the Luciferian connection with running this world.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.466]  Seems like the people nowadays, we're living off the bottom portion of our brain than the lizard.
[00:38:49.466 --> 00:38:51.147]  You know, the lizard people.
[00:38:51.147 --> 00:38:53.110]  And, uh, we're in some deep trouble.
[00:38:54.043 --> 00:38:55.424]  Well, sir, I gotta agree with you.
[00:38:55.424 --> 00:38:59.847]  We are in some deep trouble, but it's really because society chooses to be, and I thank you for the call.
[00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:02.850]  I mean, we choose to care about our Jenny Light.
[00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.973]  We choose to care about our sports more than knowing what our government's up to.
[00:39:06.973 --> 00:39:15.739]  We choose just to watch the nightly news or a 24-hour news network, and instead of actually becoming active in our communities, not going to our city council meetings,
[00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:19.380]  Not taking part in the political process.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.201]  I mean, we dig our own graves.
[00:39:21.201 --> 00:39:24.922]  You know, when Ron Paul says we get the government we deserve, unfortunately that is the case.
[00:39:24.922 --> 00:39:32.124]  I think that sometimes they go way over the top and it really is a reflection of the corrupted moral society we live in.
[00:39:32.124 --> 00:39:33.004]  The people are still good.
[00:39:33.544 --> 00:39:36.647]  Okay, I don't want to get totally self-righteous and out of line.
[00:39:36.647 --> 00:39:38.228]  There is a lot of goodness in people.
[00:39:38.228 --> 00:39:43.853]  A lot of people are out there, you know, to take care of their families, and there's a lot of love in their hearts, and they just don't know the bigger picture.
[00:39:43.853 --> 00:39:46.695]  But a lot of it's tacked if you're trying to wake people up.
[00:39:46.695 --> 00:39:50.959]  You know, you have to, I mean, you just were all, you went from chemtrails to Luciferianism.
[00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:54.204]  You know, a lot of, you know, people aren't going to respond to that.
[00:39:54.204 --> 00:39:59.769]  If you want people to respond to your message and you can't get them to talk about chemtrails, we'll just say, take them outside.
[00:39:59.769 --> 00:40:00.650]  Well, what is that?
[00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.051]  Oh, that's a contrail.
[00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:02.432]  Really?
[00:40:02.432 --> 00:40:03.653]  That's a contrail.
[00:40:03.653 --> 00:40:05.655]  And then you explain geoengineering.
[00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:07.257]  You have to have a laptop next to you.
[00:40:07.257 --> 00:40:08.558]  This is the information age.
[00:40:08.558 --> 00:40:12.201]  This is where everything is at the cusp of your fingertips and really your brain.
[00:40:13.274 --> 00:40:15.576]  Not just your imagination, but your recall.
[00:40:15.576 --> 00:40:16.717]  Remember we used to have recall?
[00:40:16.717 --> 00:40:18.779]  We used to teach memory in school?
[00:40:18.779 --> 00:40:22.202]  It's a very novel idea to try to remember things you're taught.
[00:40:22.202 --> 00:40:31.050]  Instead, we live in this, you know, information age where your attention span is less than 15 minutes and your retention of information is at an all-time low.
[00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:36.896]  And we do it to ourselves by slurping down, you know, mercury-filled, corn syrup-laced Coca-Colas all day.
[00:40:38.558 --> 00:40:39.999]  Forget about the alcohol.
[00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:42.900]  Forget about just the slothfulness of society.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.583]  And not everybody... I know there's a lot of good, smart people out there that are struggling, that are working three jobs trying to support a family.
[00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:49.163]  Three!
[00:40:49.163 --> 00:40:51.524]  Forget about two now, it's like three!
[00:40:51.524 --> 00:40:53.285]  Three to support a family.
[00:40:53.285 --> 00:40:57.968]  Their wife works, they can still barely afford the payments, they just don't have time for this stuff.
[00:40:57.968 --> 00:41:02.170]  But again, those people are the ones that are zombified by the nightly news.
[00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:12.396]  by their favorite talk radio guy and you have to find points of agreement with them first and then expand on those points of agreement to try to bring them beyond the false left-right paradigm.
[00:41:12.396 --> 00:41:14.957]  That's what I found works the best.
[00:41:14.957 --> 00:41:16.679]  Alright, let's go to Josh in Florida.
[00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:19.020]  Josh, you're on the line.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:19.941]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:19.941 --> 00:41:20.821]  How are you doing?
[00:41:20.821 --> 00:41:21.341]  Good.
[00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:26.104]  Yeah, I had a question about, well not a question, I had some comments about eugenics.
[00:41:26.104 --> 00:41:31.728]  I know Alex was asking a few days ago for solutions, like what he should do if he should start an organization.
[00:41:32.767 --> 00:41:36.129]  But in front of me, I have the City of Tamarack.
[00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:38.090]  That's in Broward County, South Florida.
[00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.531]  I have the 2007 Water Quality Report.
[00:41:41.531 --> 00:41:52.076]  And then in this packet, you open it up, and it tells you, okay, they put fluoride in it at 0.722 parts per million.
[00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:59.820]  And then we also have all these things that are not available, chloromethane, which is a refrigerant.
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.420]  They also put
[00:42:01.241 --> 00:42:05.284]  Acetone in it, which is a nail polish remover.
[00:42:05.284 --> 00:42:11.148]  They also have two butanone, which is used in plastics, plastics.
[00:42:11.148 --> 00:42:16.291]  They also have chloroform, and that's used in Teflon.
[00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:22.715]  And it also says dichlorobromethane, which is on the water supply.
[00:42:22.715 --> 00:42:24.577]  Yeah, and I have it right here.
[00:42:24.577 --> 00:42:25.878]  The Water Quality Report 2007.
[00:42:25.878 --> 00:42:30.841]  They have sodium, fluoride, barium, and then all those things I just listed.
[00:42:31.337 --> 00:42:41.025]  And you just do a quick, you know, Google search, looking on Wikipedia, and you find out that all these things are in plastics, nail polish remover, and it's pretty crazy.
[00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.566]  I actually have a... I call it that.
[00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:43.787]  It is crazy.
[00:42:43.787 --> 00:42:44.228]  And you know what?
[00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:51.654]  The public doesn't even care, and beyond just drinking it, I mean, you absorb that through your skin when you're taking a shower, and you're getting your daily dose of... Yeah, you breathe it in.
[00:42:51.954 --> 00:42:52.314]  I need you
[00:43:12.383 --> 00:43:15.708]  That's what you have to explain to people while you're talking about chemtrails.
[00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:18.592]  You know, again, don't go off into other tangents.
[00:43:18.592 --> 00:43:19.754]  I thank you for the call, Josh.
[00:43:19.754 --> 00:43:20.936]  Great caller.
[00:43:20.936 --> 00:43:23.560]  Hopefully we can post that over there because people aren't aware.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.701]  Barium in your water.
[00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:25.763]  Did you just hear the guy?
[00:43:25.763 --> 00:43:27.185]  Barium.
[00:43:27.185 --> 00:43:28.187]  Chloroform.
[00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:38.488]  I mean, people know from movies, because people relate to movies so well, because movies are people's lives, but chloroform is bad, bad, bad.
[00:43:38.488 --> 00:43:40.409]  It will knock you out.
[00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:47.755]  Let's go to movies again, because I know people relate to the movies, they love the Hollywood pictures, but when somebody's being abducted or attacked, what do they always do?
[00:43:47.755 --> 00:43:50.677]  They take a rag with chloroform in it.
[00:43:50.677 --> 00:43:52.358]  You're not supposed to drink it.
[00:43:52.358 --> 00:43:53.679]  It's not good for your body.
[00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:54.760]  It's not good for your kids.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.443]  You're not supposed to absorb it through your skin and wash yourself with chloroform.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.981]  I don't... Radical ideas coming out of this program!
[00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:06.342]  Alright, let's go to Dave in North Carolina.
[00:44:06.342 --> 00:44:07.522]  Dave, you're on the line.
[00:44:07.522 --> 00:44:08.902]  Northern California, brother.
[00:44:08.902 --> 00:44:10.443]  It's good to talk to you again.
[00:44:10.443 --> 00:44:11.243]  Thank you.
[00:44:11.243 --> 00:44:12.343]  Two things.
[00:44:12.343 --> 00:44:19.285]  One, I want to take this opportunity to applaud that congressman that stood up and talked about eugenics on the floor of the House.
[00:44:19.895 --> 00:44:20.715]  Thank you, sir.
[00:44:20.715 --> 00:44:22.116]  What was his name again?
[00:44:22.116 --> 00:44:28.577]  His name is Joseph Pitts, and I think that we're going to play that clip on the other side of the next segment.
[00:44:28.577 --> 00:44:35.919]  We're going to definitely play that again, because it's only a minute and 27 seconds, and it really does deserve a standing applause, really.
[00:44:35.919 --> 00:44:37.519]  Yeah, well, here it is.
[00:44:37.519 --> 00:44:38.419]  Yeah!
[00:44:38.419 --> 00:44:39.860]  Way to go, dude!
[00:44:42.392 --> 00:44:48.694]  Alright, so on the Eater, I have the PDF here in front of me, and I look at it really close.
[00:44:48.694 --> 00:44:52.195]  In the PDF itself, it doesn't say anything about using bodies.
[00:44:52.195 --> 00:44:52.935]  Okay.
[00:44:52.935 --> 00:44:56.696]  So I'm not sure where that came from, but let me give you a couple of the highlights from it.
[00:44:56.696 --> 00:44:58.256]  It's kind of interesting.
[00:44:58.256 --> 00:45:01.117]  The rationale and utility part, what it's going to be used for.
[00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:12.455]  The inherent advantage is the ability to engage in long endurance, tedious, and hazardous tasks such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition without fatigue or stress.
[00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:17.880]  Basically, these things can stay out there forever, eating stuff and cruising around.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.143]  And scanning down to the bottom here, they talk about the number of applications.
[00:45:23.645 --> 00:45:35.114]  Commercialization of the Eater is focused on developing a prototype for military applications, that's number one, and civil applications, including homeland security.
[00:45:35.114 --> 00:45:49.265]  Evolving autonomous intelligent control, which basically means it can do everything, you know, in a primitive way, it can think the way humans can do, it can make decisions, and to provide unmanned ground, water,
[00:45:50.214 --> 00:46:07.445]  Uh, Robotic Swarms and Cognitive Collectives, Driverless Cars, Distributed Intelligence, Ubiquitous Intelligence, and Intelligent Infrastructures, Control of Complex Systems of Systems, and Decision Making for Decision Makers.
[00:46:07.445 --> 00:46:09.667]  In other words, it basically is a swarm of these things.
[00:46:10.605 --> 00:46:12.226]  Uh, you know, all interrelated.
[00:46:28.243 --> 00:46:35.087]  So anyway, I'm not sure on the body thing, but... Well, I think the fact that it's biomass is they're just assuming.
[00:46:35.087 --> 00:46:41.010]  I have to check the PDF file myself out, but I do wonder, you know, what are these things going to do?
[00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.051]  Reject a mouse that's in the field?
[00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:45.912]  Are they going to reject, you know, a dead bird?
[00:46:45.912 --> 00:46:47.173]  Or are they actually going to absorb it?
[00:46:47.173 --> 00:46:51.715]  I mean, is it possible that they could build these things large enough to consume human bodies?
[00:46:51.715 --> 00:46:54.017]  I mean, I think that is a possibility.
[00:46:54.017 --> 00:46:56.078]  And, you know, it is odd to me the way that they
[00:46:56.878 --> 00:46:57.218]  Yes.
[00:46:57.218 --> 00:46:59.339]  Good afternoon, by the way.
[00:46:59.339 --> 00:47:08.624]  This is a totally different subject than what you've been discussing, but I'm hoping maybe you can give me just a little bit of advice.
[00:47:08.624 --> 00:47:14.147]  I'm a grandmother of three little girls, ages four, six, and seven.
[00:47:26.008 --> 00:47:31.213]  And they are a victim of Children's Services here in Jackson County, Ohio.
[00:47:31.213 --> 00:47:33.555]  We have a corrupt and unethical judge.
[00:47:33.555 --> 00:47:38.039]  We have attorneys that feel behind closed doors.
[00:47:38.039 --> 00:47:44.245]  And these kids are in foster care with nothing ever proven legally as to why they should have even been taken.
[00:47:44.245 --> 00:47:48.389]  But now, after 15 months, they're putting them up for adoption.
[00:47:50.199 --> 00:47:55.904]  Well, that is a tragic story, and ma'am, I wish I had some advice for you other than to fight these people tooth and nail.
[00:47:55.904 --> 00:48:00.607]  It's something maybe you could take up with Alex when he returns on Monday, but I really don't know what to tell you.
[00:48:00.607 --> 00:48:04.150]  I don't know the specifics of the case, and I really just can't go into them on the show today.
[00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.411]  I thank you for the call.
[00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:08.073]  All right, I'm going to do a little bit of a news blitz, and then on the other side...
[00:48:08.914 --> 00:48:20.347]  We're going to play that clip again of the representative out of Pennsylvania, Joseph Pitts, talking about the eugenics program and Judge Ginsburg's support of such a program.
[00:48:20.347 --> 00:48:24.692]  I mean, this guy, again, it was a beautiful moment on the House floor.
[00:48:26.101 --> 00:48:29.283]  Moon landing tapes got erased, NASA admits.
[00:48:29.283 --> 00:48:33.006]  Now, I want people to understand just how ludicrous this story is.
[00:48:33.006 --> 00:48:44.693]  Now, in the news all over yesterday, oh, it's coming up on the 40th anniversary of the moon landings, and it's really happening, oh, the moon landings, we're gonna redo the footage!
[00:48:44.693 --> 00:48:46.854]  Look at how great that footage looks!
[00:48:46.854 --> 00:48:51.738]  Now NASA is coming out and saying, oh, we erased the moon landing tapes?
[00:48:51.738 --> 00:48:51.958]  I mean,
[00:48:53.318 --> 00:48:55.819]  It's comical!
[00:48:55.819 --> 00:49:01.842]  The man walks on the moon for the first time and the agency responsible for the tapes erases them.
[00:49:01.842 --> 00:49:03.263]  Yeah, that's plausible.
[00:49:03.263 --> 00:49:08.246]  See, they took the original, what they broadcast on television, and they cleaned that up because they claimed they didn't have them.
[00:49:08.246 --> 00:49:08.646]  Come on.
[00:49:09.417 --> 00:49:11.959]  Please.
[00:49:11.959 --> 00:49:20.324]  You would have to be, I mean, the dumbest person in the entire world to erase the moon landing tapes.
[00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:34.033]  I'm not even going to take it any farther, folks, but if you believe that, I have several bridges across the United States to sell you at an unbelievable price if you believe that NASA erased the moon landing tapes.
[00:49:34.773 --> 00:49:36.454]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:36.454 --> 00:49:38.456]  Give me a break.
[00:49:38.456 --> 00:49:43.139]  I mean, it's almost too far beyond the pale.
[00:49:44.733 --> 00:49:48.014]  Obama has tough love message for African-Americans.
[00:49:48.014 --> 00:49:54.116]  Now remember, you're seeing all these different City Year commercials, the majority of which are reaching out to youthful minorities.
[00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:57.817]  There are a couple where they are trying to get the white youth to join as well.
[00:49:57.817 --> 00:50:02.039]  But, I mean, you literally, you never hear a white guy going, this will be great for Caucasians to join.
[00:50:02.039 --> 00:50:08.921]  However, they do have a young African-American guy saying, you know, if you're a person of color, you need to join City Year.
[00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:10.982]  Meanwhile, there's another guy zipping up, I'm fierce.
[00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.363]  I'm fierce.
[00:50:13.363 --> 00:50:14.684]  People doing jumping jacks.
[00:50:14.684 --> 00:50:15.704]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:50:15.704 --> 00:50:17.265]  Youth Corps have always been a good idea.
[00:50:17.265 --> 00:50:19.507]  So here he's telling, we're going to have to work.
[00:50:19.507 --> 00:50:21.928]  And you know, nobody's getting the pass.
[00:50:21.928 --> 00:50:23.369]  City Year's a good place to go.
[00:50:23.369 --> 00:50:33.736]  President Barack Obama had a tough love message for fellow African-Americans on Thursday, urging black parents to push their children to think beyond dreams of being sports stars or rap music performers.
[00:50:33.736 --> 00:50:35.577]  Hey, I got news for you, Obama.
[00:50:35.577 --> 00:50:40.380]  It's not just black kids that want to be rap stars and sports heroes.
[00:50:42.048 --> 00:50:43.649]  It's just about every kid out there.
[00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:44.510]  It's the culture.
[00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.371]  Why are you blaming it on African-American kids?
[00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:47.332]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:47.332 --> 00:50:48.273]  We'll be back after this.
[00:50:48.273 --> 00:50:49.514]  I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:52.496]  Check out the latest at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:01.277 --> 00:51:12.188]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:51:12.188 --> 00:51:16.353]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:51:16.353 --> 00:51:18.515]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:18.515 --> 00:51:23.981]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:24.121 --> 00:51:34.151]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:51:34.151 --> 00:51:40.657]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:51:40.657 --> 00:51:44.000]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.062]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:51:46.062 --> 00:51:48.985]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:51:49.165 --> 00:51:51.671]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:52:01.508 --> 00:52:07.553]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.553 --> 00:52:13.438]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:13.438 --> 00:52:19.604]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.924 --> 00:52:21.886]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.886 --> 00:52:24.368]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:24.368 --> 00:52:37.558]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:37.558 --> 00:52:39.219]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.219 --> 00:52:41.081]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:41.081 --> 00:52:47.326]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.978 --> 00:52:56.245]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.245 --> 00:52:57.826]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.826 --> 00:53:00.748]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.748 --> 00:53:05.572]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this might be the
[00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:11.420]  I think?
[00:53:25.916 --> 00:53:26.276]  I think so.
[00:53:55.888 --> 00:53:56.449]  That's 866-242-9210 today.
[00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.669]  Alright, folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:27.669 --> 00:54:28.590]  I'm Jason Brimus sitting in.
[00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.351]  We're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:35.172]  I want to thank another one of our great sponsors, Diginet.net.
[00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:37.953]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[00:54:37.953 --> 00:54:39.614]  I want to tell you about our sponsor, Diginet.net.
[00:54:40.914 --> 00:54:42.715]  Okay, these guys have the best surveillance systems.
[00:54:42.715 --> 00:54:44.176]  You can hook things up in your car.
[00:54:44.176 --> 00:54:45.778]  They have the DigiPens.
[00:54:45.778 --> 00:54:46.558]  Great quality.
[00:54:46.558 --> 00:54:49.440]  I think it's 640x480, which is standard definition.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.741]  You won't believe the video.
[00:54:50.741 --> 00:54:52.082]  And no one will know the wiser.
[00:54:52.082 --> 00:54:55.144]  I mean, you literally just set your pen up right here.
[00:54:55.144 --> 00:54:58.106]  Or, I mean, some of the many things that they have are just completely unbelievable.
[00:54:58.106 --> 00:55:00.268]  The hard drives get bigger and bigger every day.
[00:55:00.268 --> 00:55:02.169]  You won't believe how much stuff you can store.
[00:55:02.169 --> 00:55:02.890]  It's diginet.net.
[00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:06.952]  Now I'm going to try to take one or two calls.
[00:55:06.952 --> 00:55:09.316]  We'll try to go to Steve and Chris in a moment.
[00:55:09.316 --> 00:55:18.612]  But first I want to play this clip again of Representative Joseph Pitts on the House floor out of Pennsylvania talking about the eugenics program that the elite carry out daily.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:23.580]  Thank you.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.083]  For what purpose is a gentleman from Pennsylvania?
[00:55:26.083 --> 00:55:27.084]  Gentleman's recognized.
[00:55:27.084 --> 00:55:33.870]  Mr. Speaker, last week's New York Times Magazine featured an interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:38.995]  Some of her comments were absolutely astonishing, coming from a sitting Supreme Court Justice.
[00:55:38.995 --> 00:55:42.738]  But the most disturbing comment came in reference to abortion.
[00:55:42.738 --> 00:55:46.702]  In reference to Roe v. Wade, the infamous Supreme Court case, she said this.
[00:55:47.162 --> 00:55:47.382]  Quote,
[00:56:17.022 --> 00:56:17.922]  All right, there he is again.
[00:56:17.922 --> 00:56:19.503]  Just an amazing speech on the House floor.
[00:56:19.503 --> 00:56:20.543]  And bravo, Mr. Pitts.
[00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:21.604]  All right, let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:21.604 --> 00:56:22.744]  Steve, you're on the line.
[00:56:46.543 --> 00:57:03.655]  Um, I just first off want to thank Congressman Pitts for, you know, supporting our rights and, um, I wanted to make a point, um, regarding a common misconception about robotics.
[00:57:03.655 --> 00:57:04.635]  Okay.
[00:57:04.635 --> 00:57:09.979]  Um, I actually study robotics and one of the things we
[00:57:10.717 --> 00:57:13.898]  Not we, like I'm some kind of part of an organization.
[00:57:13.898 --> 00:57:19.219]  One of the things they strive for is being autonomous.
[00:57:19.219 --> 00:57:21.319]  And that is self-sufficiency.
[00:57:21.319 --> 00:57:27.800]  And you see that with these man-eater robots.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:35.202]  They want to create robots that can tell where they are and gain the necessary energy to do a task.
[00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:38.603]  That is the forefront of everything we're trying to do.
[00:57:46.075 --> 00:57:55.499]  It's important not to underestimate the intelligence level of the people behind this field.
[00:57:55.499 --> 00:58:06.604]  Look, the way I'm looking at it, man, is that public technology is at least 20 or 30 years behind what they have in closed doors and underground facilities in these Lockheed Martin and DARPA institutes.
[00:58:06.604 --> 00:58:10.026]  Let's be honest, again, if the Nazis had the stealth bomber,
[00:58:10.586 --> 00:58:14.068]  And it took almost 70 years to make that public knowledge.
[00:58:14.068 --> 00:58:15.849]  What else are they hiding from us?
[00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:24.514]  If they're rolling out glow-in-the-dark pigs and dogs, what else have they done with bioengineering behind closed doors?
[00:58:24.514 --> 00:58:26.795]  I mean, obviously something else is going on.
[00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:29.317]  And yes, there are some very intelligent people out there.
[00:58:29.317 --> 00:58:30.797]  I mean, how far was it 20 years ago?
[00:58:30.797 --> 00:58:31.898]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:31.898 --> 00:58:32.818]  We'll be back after this.
[00:58:32.818 --> 00:58:34.680]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:42.921 --> 00:58:45.410]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:47.739]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:55.643]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.220]  We're good.
[00:59:53.439 --> 00:59:55.842]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.842 --> 01:00:01.009]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:01.009 --> 01:00:02.031]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.448 --> 01:00:08.210]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.992]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.992 --> 01:00:11.554]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.554 --> 01:00:13.116]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.116 --> 01:00:17.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:22.047]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.047 --> 01:00:23.669]  Alright, folks, we are live.
[01:00:23.669 --> 01:00:25.691]  I am Jason Korma, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:31.115]  Obama has a tough love message for African Americans.
[01:00:31.115 --> 01:00:35.137]  Now, again, when you read this, it's kind of insulting to me.
[01:00:35.137 --> 01:00:42.880]  Because this isn't just, again, being a sports hero or a rap star isn't exclusive to the quote-unquote African American community.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.780]  It is all over.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.561]  It's pop culture, baby.
[01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:54.164]  I mean, if you go down in Mississippi, is it any worse for a white kid to have the same dream of being an athletic star or maybe instead of a rapper, a country star?
[01:00:54.864 --> 01:00:57.993]  And believe me, there are kids in Mississippi listening to the rap.
[01:00:57.993 --> 01:00:59.237]  It's all over the place.
[01:00:59.237 --> 01:01:00.701]  It's an old form of music now.
[01:01:00.701 --> 01:01:01.604]  It's been around almost 30 years.
[01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:05.202]  It's at its crescendo in pop culture.
[01:01:05.202 --> 01:01:10.946]  So a lot of this stuff is just totally mindless and totally insulting in my opinion.
[01:01:10.946 --> 01:01:17.430]  We need a new mindset as though he's part of the African-American community, folks.
[01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:18.931]  He's half white.
[01:01:18.931 --> 01:01:21.272]  His father had tons of money, tons of women.
[01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:23.113]  He was a polygamist, okay?
[01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.874]  He had several wives all over.
[01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:26.195]  He traveled the world.
[01:01:26.195 --> 01:01:27.216]  He's an internationalist.
[01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:31.398]  He doesn't know what being a poor African-American is.
[01:01:31.398 --> 01:01:32.179]  He never knew that.
[01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:35.137]  Oh, I know he was taken care of by his grandmother.
[01:01:35.137 --> 01:01:36.698]  He has such a hard luck story.
[01:01:36.698 --> 01:01:38.560]  He smoked meth.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.283]  Oh, President Obama, we can relate to you on so many levels.
[01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:53.012]  We need a new mindset, a new set of attitudes, because one of the most durable and destructive legacies of discrimination is the way that we have internalized a sense of limitation.
[01:01:53.012 --> 01:01:54.794]  What?
[01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:58.397]  We have internalized a sense of limitation based on discrimination?
[01:01:58.397 --> 01:02:00.739]  I think that that's totally just condescending.
[01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:06.422]  How so many in our community have come to expect so little of ourselves?
[01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:10.144]  Sir, that's beyond the African American community, unfortunately.
[01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:15.068]  Unfortunately, the world, not even the world, you know, there are some go-getters out there.
[01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:23.394]  You see people in third world and second world nations really working, you know, 16, 18 hours a day to try to get somewhere in life, to try to take care of their family.
[01:02:23.394 --> 01:02:24.895]  Here, there's a sense of entitlement.
[01:02:25.455 --> 01:02:26.876]  It's not just black people.
[01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.699]  There's plenty of white people who are lazy out there that have a sense of entitlement.
[01:02:30.699 --> 01:02:31.680]  And we like that.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.561]  See, that's what he doesn't tell you.
[01:02:33.561 --> 01:02:43.889]  The social engineers, his bosses actually like you to be dependent on social services, dependent on the federal government, dependent on these programs.
[01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:52.095]  But see, now he's setting you up to get into a new kind of program, a community program, City Year, or some other AmeriCorps type job.
[01:02:52.916 --> 01:03:03.922]  Obama had a packed ballroom at a Manhattan hotel that blacks need to recapture the spirit of civil rights movement of a half century ago to tackle problems and have struck African-Americans disproportionately.
[01:03:03.922 --> 01:03:07.784]  Joblessness, spiraling health care costs, and HIV AIDS.
[01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:13.087]  Well, maybe you shouldn't develop bioweapons that are race-specific then.
[01:03:13.087 --> 01:03:13.707]  Huh?
[01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:14.488]  Not that you did it.
[01:03:14.488 --> 01:03:16.469]  Your handlers, your bosses did it.
[01:03:17.537 --> 01:03:22.058]  But Obama, give me a break with this garbage.
[01:03:22.058 --> 01:03:23.318]  This is garbajo.
[01:03:23.318 --> 01:03:30.799]  The real Civil Rights Movement is the Patriot Movement, is the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:35.180]  We're the ones that want civil rights for all human beings.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:41.081]  We don't like being discriminated against because we make $30,000 a year, or we make $15,000 a year, or we don't live in a nice house.
[01:03:45.438 --> 01:03:48.020]  We don't like being discriminated against because we're the little guy.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.861]  It doesn't have anything to do with the color of your skin.
[01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.522]  Get it through your heads, people.
[01:03:52.522 --> 01:03:58.085]  This is a war not only on the poor, but the middle class and the upper middle class.
[01:03:58.085 --> 01:03:59.566]  All you yuppies out there, guess what?
[01:03:59.566 --> 01:04:01.868]  There ain't a place at the table for you either.
[01:04:01.868 --> 01:04:09.652]  Maybe one out of ten of you will work in some kind of like slave CEO office or, you know, be a real important person over at the FEMA camps.
[01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.371]  Maybe.
[01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:17.832]  Maybe you will be able to take care of your family on the slave grid.
[01:04:17.832 --> 01:04:18.932]  A few of you.
[01:04:18.932 --> 01:04:23.573]  But believe me, your standard of living is going down with the rest of us that survived this mess.
[01:04:23.573 --> 01:04:28.114]  So again, the real civil rights movement is the patriot movement.
[01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.415]  Are the people that want more liberty, more freedom.
[01:04:30.415 --> 01:04:32.235]  They want the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:33.315]  They want less government.
[01:04:33.315 --> 01:04:35.156]  They want accountability.
[01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:36.896]  They don't want massive bailouts.
[01:04:38.203 --> 01:04:39.684]  That's a no-no.
[01:04:39.684 --> 01:04:47.029]  They don't want bankruptcies and bailouts of industries that are just going to be put into this grid, this North American Union grid, like Chrysler.
[01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:48.370]  We don't want that.
[01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:53.254]  We don't want health bills and climate change bills that are only going to tax and enslave us.
[01:04:53.254 --> 01:04:54.475]  We're against that, too.
[01:04:54.475 --> 01:04:55.295]  That's the real movement.
[01:04:55.295 --> 01:04:56.056]  We'll be back after this.
[01:04:56.056 --> 01:04:56.836]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:56.836 --> 01:04:59.338]  I'm Jason Bermas, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com.
[01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:02.410]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:07.155]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:05:07.155 --> 01:05:10.119]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:05:10.119 --> 01:05:13.162]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:05:13.162 --> 01:05:19.009]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.473]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:22.473 --> 01:05:29.461]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:29.461 --> 01:05:32.744]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:32.744 --> 01:05:33.005]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:33.005 --> 01:05:34.626]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:44.136]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:05:44.136 --> 01:05:47.759]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:47.759 --> 01:05:49.280]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:49.901]  Take action today.
[01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:51.723]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:00.367 --> 01:06:04.611]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:06:04.611 --> 01:06:06.612]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:06:06.612 --> 01:06:15.140]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:20.704]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:06:20.704 --> 01:06:22.326]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:29.068]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:40.110]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:40.891]  That's right.
[01:06:40.891 --> 01:06:43.451]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:06:43.451 --> 01:06:45.032]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:06:47.273 --> 01:06:47.613]  6043.
[01:06:47.613 --> 01:06:50.778]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:06:50.778 --> 01:06:58.171]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:06:58.171 --> 01:06:59.413]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:03.229]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[01:07:03.229 --> 01:07:04.490]  I've been so sick.
[01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:06.170]  Will the Life Change Tea help me?
[01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.031]  Our answer is always the same.
[01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:14.133]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[01:07:14.133 --> 01:07:20.036]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:24.538]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[01:07:24.538 --> 01:07:25.958]  We use results.
[01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:29.980]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:35.322]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[01:07:35.322 --> 01:07:39.183]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:43.085]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[01:07:43.085 --> 01:07:48.026]  Our number is 928-308-0408.
[01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:51.048]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[01:07:51.048 --> 01:07:54.789]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:57.330]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:07:57.330 --> 01:07:59.951]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[01:08:01.209 --> 01:08:03.997]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:06.784]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:16.804]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:08:16.804 --> 01:08:17.524]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:18.465]  I'm Jason Verma sitting in.
[01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:21.325]  We're going to have Bob Dacey in the studio in about 20 minutes.
[01:08:21.325 --> 01:08:27.306]  We're going to have Bob Chapman on at the top of the next hour with Bob Dacey riding shotgun.
[01:08:27.306 --> 01:08:31.147]  We're going to take some more calls and then hit some more news.
[01:08:31.147 --> 01:08:33.708]  Walmart needs industry support for green labels.
[01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:37.088]  We're going to get into Slave Mart with new slave labels that you can buy.
[01:08:37.088 --> 01:08:37.548]  That's right.
[01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:38.709]  The green movement is everywhere.
[01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:43.850]  And in the parking lots at Walmart now, I have to see, oh, a parking space for a green automobile.
[01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:44.870]  It makes me want to throw up.
[01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:47.791]  Alright, let's go to Chris in Florida.
[01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:56.334]  Chris, you're online.
[01:08:56.334 --> 01:08:57.934]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:57.934 --> 01:09:01.916]  I gotta let you go.
[01:09:01.916 --> 01:09:03.456]  Your phone is just too bad, man.
[01:09:03.456 --> 01:09:06.797]  I'm sorry you held on for so long, but literally I heard every other word.
[01:09:06.797 --> 01:09:07.818]  I really apologize.
[01:09:07.818 --> 01:09:09.018]  Listen to the refeed.
[01:09:09.018 --> 01:09:11.259]  Alright, let's go to Dee in Minnesota.
[01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:11.879]  Dee, you're online.
[01:09:12.543 --> 01:09:15.484]  Hi Jason, I saw your film Loose Change and Fabled Enemies.
[01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.464]  They were good.
[01:09:16.464 --> 01:09:18.464]  Oh, thank you.
[01:09:18.464 --> 01:09:22.885]  I did see that book that that Holdren wrote.
[01:09:22.885 --> 01:09:25.405]  That scares the hell out of me.
[01:09:25.405 --> 01:09:27.306]  Oh, you're talking about the Eugenics book, right?
[01:09:27.306 --> 01:09:33.407]  Where he's basically talking about geoengineering and population control and sustainability.
[01:09:33.407 --> 01:09:35.447]  They love that word, sustainability.
[01:09:35.447 --> 01:09:36.147]  Yeah.
[01:09:36.147 --> 01:09:40.188]  And, you know, this guy is, I mean, they put out a press release because of the
[01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:54.422]  Because we have a large audience, and when we expose somebody like this, there's a new press release out there that Obama's science czar, and personally I'm just disturbed at the perception that we're using the term czar all over the place now.
[01:09:54.422 --> 01:10:00.268]  Our science czar does not support coercive population control, spokesman says.
[01:10:00.268 --> 01:10:01.990]  However, who was it?
[01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:08.434]  One of Obama's other administrators is a member of the World Sustainable Society and calls for global governance.
[01:10:08.434 --> 01:10:10.335]  Gordon Brown is another member of this.
[01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:15.678]  It really seems like he's stacking up his administration for people who are pro-population control.
[01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:21.482]  I mean, you look at Catherine Sebelius, and she's one of these people that's been to Bilderberg the last couple of years.
[01:10:21.482 --> 01:10:22.923]  A total minion of the elites.
[01:10:22.923 --> 01:10:24.544]  Go ahead.
[01:10:24.544 --> 01:10:26.405]  Just attacking Iran stuff.
[01:10:26.405 --> 01:10:27.986]  I'm seeing stuff in the news that
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.500]  They're going to do it.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:35.983]  That scares the hell out of me because that with the carbon tax is really, really going to just kill the economy.
[01:10:35.983 --> 01:10:46.388]  I don't know if they're going to be able to have a hot, hard war in Iran without some kind of a provocateur, westernized false flag event.
[01:10:46.388 --> 01:10:49.289]  I really just don't see the support for it in this country.
[01:10:49.289 --> 01:10:57.593]  People have really curled back now that Obama's here on the fact that we need to get out of Afghanistan and Iraq, but we just lost more people in Afghanistan, more casualties in Afghanistan
[01:10:58.033 --> 01:10:59.954]  Hey, this is actually Craig from We Are Change, New Jersey.
[01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:03.617]  Just calling in to give an account of what happened to us at the John Corzine Barack Obama rally yesterday.
[01:11:27.739 --> 01:11:28.340]  Okay.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:35.606]  Uh, we had one of our members detained by, uh, New Jersey State Police, uh, for handing out DVDs.
[01:11:35.606 --> 01:11:37.187]  What DVDs were you handing out?
[01:11:37.187 --> 01:11:38.348]  Obama Deception, I hope?
[01:11:38.348 --> 01:11:46.455]  We put, yeah, we put together a car, uh, a double, uh, a double, uh, disc of Endgame and the Obama Deception.
[01:11:46.455 --> 01:11:46.815]  Excellent.
[01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:48.536]  On one DVD.
[01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:51.038]  And, uh, we had one copy to hand out.
[01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:54.081]  And, uh, he got grabbed up and escorted to his car.
[01:11:55.487 --> 01:11:56.008]  I think so.
[01:12:11.872 --> 01:12:14.693]  Totally taken aback and intimidated by the whole situation.
[01:12:14.693 --> 01:12:23.876]  So he was a teenager in his early 20s and they decided to pick him out of the crowd of people that were handing out DVDs to try to make a point and then they detained him illegally.
[01:12:23.876 --> 01:12:25.577]  But they ended up letting him go in the long run.
[01:12:25.577 --> 01:12:27.338]  They didn't like what he was doing.
[01:12:27.338 --> 01:12:39.282]  Yeah, and what happened was there was probably I'd say 30 or 40 people that showed up to protest and we were kind of cordoned off into a little free speech zone well away from any crowds.
[01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:44.993]  We had our own dedicated unit of the New Jersey Storm Troop, I mean State Police.
[01:12:46.499 --> 01:12:59.769]  Well, sir, you're just lucky that you didn't get tased in the mouth or shot in the face because that's the kind of country we live in where the law enforcement are the authorities, they are the lords, they are the gods, they make split decisions when people like yourself try to go against the status quo.
[01:12:59.769 --> 01:13:05.974]  I mean, you're challenging Obama, sir, and, you know, if you don't like that little free speech area, you won't get none.
[01:13:05.974 --> 01:13:08.156]  We can just take you down to the jailhouse.
[01:13:08.156 --> 01:13:09.116]  And that's what they told me.
[01:13:09.116 --> 01:13:14.521]  We had our video cameras, which is, in my opinion, the best weapon against tyranny ever.
[01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:14.901]  Absolutely.
[01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:16.062]  Has it been posted on YouTube yet?
[01:13:17.677 --> 01:13:19.678]  Has it been posted on YouTube yet?
[01:13:19.678 --> 01:13:21.799]  Uh, we should have it up by tonight or tomorrow morning.
[01:13:21.799 --> 01:13:23.279]  We have some issues with video transfer.
[01:13:23.279 --> 01:13:35.284]  Alright, well as soon as you send it over to Jason at WeAreChange, or not, Jason at WeAreChange, Jason at LooseChange91.com or RobD at InfoWars.com and get it out to us.
[01:13:35.284 --> 01:13:36.204]  I'll play it on the Sunday Show.
[01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:39.745]  I'm going to be sitting in for Alex for an hour and 15 minutes before I take off for my trip.
[01:13:39.745 --> 01:13:41.086]  I thank you for the call, man.
[01:13:41.086 --> 01:13:43.967]  Let's go to Dave in Oklahoma.
[01:13:43.967 --> 01:13:45.407]  Dave, you're on the line.
[01:13:45.407 --> 01:13:46.848]  Hey Dave, uh, hey Jason.
[01:13:47.535 --> 01:13:54.920]  I just wanted to let you know, Prison Planet member, and certainly appreciate the great job that you and Alex are doing.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.602]  I have a couple things I wanted to talk to you about.
[01:13:57.602 --> 01:14:01.284]  The first thing, the eugenics movement.
[01:14:01.284 --> 01:14:07.428]  I'm real concerned about this swine flu vaccination that they keep talking about.
[01:14:08.197 --> 01:14:15.061]  Yeah, I'm very concerned about it, too, and I really think that they're going to try to institute it on an international level and forcibly inoculate people.
[01:14:15.061 --> 01:14:18.123]  It really looks like they're going to say everyone has to take it.
[01:14:18.123 --> 01:14:26.468]  You know, it's not a coincidence that I'm reading articles two months ago on the air where they say they're going to have 4.9 billion of these vaccines.
[01:14:26.468 --> 01:14:29.930]  4.9 billion!
[01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:30.991]  You with me, Dave?
[01:14:30.991 --> 01:14:36.114]  Yeah, it's a little more serious for me because I have children and, you know,
[01:14:36.864 --> 01:14:50.690]  Researching the law up here in Oklahoma, I just found out that, you know, you don't have to succumb to the, you know, forced vaccines and inoculations under state law.
[01:14:50.690 --> 01:15:01.334]  It actually says that, you know, if you, you know, object to on a religious or moral ground, then you can, you know, avoid getting inoculated.
[01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:03.375]  But I'm real concerned about that.
[01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:06.256]  And if I can ask you two other things real quickly.
[01:15:07.475 --> 01:15:23.740]  For your listeners commenting about, you know, getting the word out, I think the best thing that we can do is just, we're winning the war, we're winning with the information war, we just have to open up people's eyes.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:29.382]  And, you know, if they question the legality or, you know, the legitimate
[01:15:30.802 --> 01:15:31.042]  I don't
[01:15:52.777 --> 01:15:54.899]  And I think the endgame and the Obama deception are very powerful.
[01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:56.440]  Viewing parties are a necessity.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.722]  And my last question is regarding, and this ties into eugenics as well,
[01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:22.978]  Uh, the water supply.
[01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:26.644]  I know one of your first callers was talking about all the chemicals.
[01:16:26.644 --> 01:16:30.070]  Do you think that we could ever get back to where
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.722]  We can get these pollutants out of our water supply.
[01:16:32.722 --> 01:16:35.144]  We can certainly get less of them, number one.
[01:16:35.144 --> 01:16:36.626]  We can certainly get less.
[01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:43.772]  And you know, if we made a concerted effort, I don't see why we couldn't get rid of them completely with filtration systems that would get rid of this stuff.
[01:16:43.772 --> 01:16:46.955]  But it's going, I mean that's a very uphill battle.
[01:16:46.955 --> 01:16:54.002]  Most people are just in so much denial about that, they refuse to even acknowledge the subject because they don't like the fact that they're being polluted.
[01:16:54.002 --> 01:16:54.782]  Hey Dave, how's it going?
[01:17:22.363 --> 01:17:32.289]  I just want to see if anybody is aware that there's an article on nss.gov and the National Science Foundation titled, Solar Cycle Linked to Global Climate.
[01:17:32.289 --> 01:17:44.015]  And it just says how the solar cycle, they've found out through research that it actually does cause climate change, but only a small fraction of it compared to what the humans are doing to the Earth, supposedly.
[01:17:44.679 --> 01:17:50.601]  So wait, they're admitting to the sun cycle, but they're saying that man is still causing global warming, that's what you're telling me?
[01:17:50.601 --> 01:17:54.262]  Yeah, in one paragraph, in the middle of the article, it mentions that man is impacted.
[01:17:54.262 --> 01:17:56.923]  See, that's what I like to call controlled opposition.
[01:17:56.923 --> 01:18:01.425]  What they'll do is they'll take something that is a fact, that the solar cycle does affect climate change again.
[01:18:01.425 --> 01:18:03.046]  We were once Pangea, folks.
[01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:05.246]  The Earth didn't always look this way.
[01:18:05.246 --> 01:18:07.867]  I'm sure the great deserts weren't always deserts.
[01:18:07.867 --> 01:18:10.848]  But none of us are around to see that, that gradual climate change.
[01:18:10.848 --> 01:18:12.169]  And it is the solar cycle.
[01:18:12.509 --> 01:18:16.332]  The solar cycle is the reason we're going into this different climate change.
[01:18:16.332 --> 01:18:23.496]  You notice they changed it from global warming in the 80s and chlorofluorocarbons to carbon dioxide from the 80s to the 90s.
[01:18:23.496 --> 01:18:30.941]  It's all propaganda to control you, to tax you, to say you can't live here or if you live here you have to pay this amount.
[01:18:30.941 --> 01:18:38.767]  It's truly a eugenics program and I encourage anybody that still believes in this farce of man-made global warming, by the way I'm not saying that men
[01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.268]  Can't create pollution.
[01:18:40.268 --> 01:18:44.971]  We obviously do that on a great level in many areas and that is a concern.
[01:18:44.971 --> 01:18:46.392]  That is a concern.
[01:18:46.392 --> 01:18:49.654]  But go watch the Great Global Warming Swindle from the BBC.
[01:18:49.654 --> 01:18:51.335]  It's readily available on YouTube.
[01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:53.276]  It's readily available on Google Video.
[01:18:53.276 --> 01:18:57.019]  It will really open your eyes to the truth about what this whole thing is about.
[01:18:57.019 --> 01:18:58.099]  Thank you for the call.
[01:18:58.099 --> 01:18:59.220]  Trey in Texas.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.361]  Trey, you're on the line.
[01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:01.682]  Yes, Trey.
[01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:07.456]  Let's go to who we on Chris in Kentucky Chris in Kentucky.
[01:19:07.456 --> 01:19:08.437]  You're online.
[01:19:08.437 --> 01:19:21.730]  Oh, he just could Roy in Indiana Roy you're online Yes, yes Jason salute you Alex Jones, and I take all you guys to bed with me I take a headset and I listen around the clock 24-7.
[01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:22.851]  Well.
[01:19:22.851 --> 01:19:25.253]  Thank you now what that said I
[01:19:26.079 --> 01:19:32.825]  I'm working with a man right now that has begun his campaign to replace Harry Reid as Nevada's U.S.
[01:19:32.825 --> 01:19:33.406]  Senator in 2010.
[01:19:33.406 --> 01:19:35.007]  That's good.
[01:19:35.007 --> 01:19:36.849]  Harry Reid needs to be replaced.
[01:19:36.849 --> 01:19:38.770]  Hold on to the other side.
[01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.452]  I'll let you talk about that.
[01:19:40.452 --> 01:19:42.894]  We're going to go over some more calls.
[01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:43.594]  Some more news.
[01:19:43.594 --> 01:19:45.716]  Bob Dacey coming up in about 10 minutes.
[01:19:45.716 --> 01:19:47.318]  Then we've got Chapman at the top of the hour.
[01:19:47.318 --> 01:19:48.439]  Alex Jones to be calling in.
[01:19:48.439 --> 01:19:49.419]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:49.419 --> 01:19:51.041]  I'm Jason Vermas sitting in.
[01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:52.022]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:52.022 --> 01:19:52.862]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:01.738 --> 01:20:03.579]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:20:03.579 --> 01:20:05.900]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.220]  It's a proven fact.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.782]  Many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:20:11.782 --> 01:20:17.485]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[01:20:17.485 --> 01:20:19.806]  Introducing Choose4Health.
[01:20:19.806 --> 01:20:25.408]  Choose4Health brings you 16 powerful ingredients in one delicious chewable.
[01:20:25.408 --> 01:20:25.688]  For around
[01:20:29.244 --> 01:20:29.564]  I think so.
[01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:53.223]  No credit card and no auto ship.
[01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:54.084]  That number again is 1-800-210-1922.
[01:20:54.084 --> 01:20:54.364]  That's 1-800-210-1922.
[01:21:02.265 --> 01:21:04.606]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:10.850]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:14.992]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.
[01:21:14.992 --> 01:21:21.816]  When you subscribe to The International Forecaster, you get Robert Chapman's 45 years of experience and concise investment recommendations.
[01:21:22.156 --> 01:21:22.797]  We're good to go.
[01:21:38.954 --> 01:21:40.054]  Experience the Difference.
[01:22:01.201 --> 01:22:07.227]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.227 --> 01:22:13.113]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.113 --> 01:22:19.280]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.561]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:24.043]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:24.043 --> 01:22:37.232]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.232 --> 01:22:38.893]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.893 --> 01:22:40.755]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:46.999]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.302]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.302 --> 01:23:07.706]  As you already know, drinking pure, high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:23:07.706 --> 01:23:12.369]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:23:12.369 --> 01:23:17.232]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:23:17.572 --> 01:23:25.296]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:23:25.296 --> 01:23:29.878]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:23:29.878 --> 01:23:35.761]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:42.046]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:24:03.547 --> 01:24:10.169]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:10.169 --> 01:24:14.910]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:16.290]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:17.110]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:18.271]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[01:24:18.271 --> 01:24:21.391]  Joining me now in studio is Bob Dacey.
[01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:25.252]  We're going to go back to Roy in Indiana in just a moment.
[01:24:25.252 --> 01:24:29.393]  First, I want to thank one of the great sponsors that helps make this show possible.
[01:24:29.393 --> 01:24:31.474]  Helps us bring you PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:31.474 --> 01:24:32.554]  Helps us bring you
[01:24:32.814 --> 01:24:36.257]  You know, 20 new stories a day over at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:36.257 --> 01:24:37.798]  It's Ecolablue.com.
[01:24:37.798 --> 01:24:40.360]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.102]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:24:43.102 --> 01:24:44.743]  E-C-O-L-O.
[01:24:44.743 --> 01:24:48.466]  And let me tell you folks, this is the coolest water filtration system out there.
[01:24:48.466 --> 01:24:52.929]  Pulls the water from the air, reverse osmosis, clean tasting.
[01:24:52.929 --> 01:24:55.291]  You got a hot option, you got a cold option.
[01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:56.492]  It's just the neatest thing out there.
[01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:58.414]  And the water is just great tasting.
[01:24:58.414 --> 01:24:59.535]  It's Ecolablue.com.
[01:24:59.535 --> 01:24:59.595]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:25:02.178 --> 01:25:03.480]  6-0-4-3.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.367]  And before we go back to callers, I want to say hello to Bob.
[01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:07.549]  What are you even up to these days, Bob?
[01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:10.761]  I'm not getting them in my mic.
[01:25:10.761 --> 01:25:11.042]  We gotcha.
[01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:11.842]  You got me?
[01:25:11.842 --> 01:25:12.582]  Yeah, we gotcha.
[01:25:12.582 --> 01:25:14.423]  Well, thank you for having me on here, Jason.
[01:25:14.423 --> 01:25:15.043]  Ain't no problem.
[01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.003]  I'm gonna be riding shotgun.
[01:25:16.003 --> 01:25:19.804]  You're gonna do all the stuff, and if I can think up something intelligent to say, I'll chime in.
[01:25:19.804 --> 01:25:20.765]  What have I been doing?
[01:25:20.765 --> 01:25:24.486]  Man, this recession has gotten me so busy, I cannot stand it.
[01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:27.127]  We have a new department in the hardware store.
[01:25:27.127 --> 01:25:33.268]  We are a distributor for eFoods, direct storable foods, and so I'm gonna do a shameless plug for my company.
[01:25:33.268 --> 01:25:36.890]  It's Hardware Store Incorporated, Spicewood Springs Road at 183 in Northwest Austin.
[01:25:38.829 --> 01:25:42.810]  Area code 512-250-1591.
[01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.051]  We stock the eFoods Freedom Unit.
[01:25:45.051 --> 01:25:47.132]  We stock the Grab and Go Pack.
[01:25:47.132 --> 01:25:49.153]  And we stock the 3-Day Responder.
[01:25:49.153 --> 01:25:52.614]  And you can buy it cheaper from us than you can over the internet.
[01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:53.074]  Hey, hey!
[01:25:53.074 --> 01:25:59.056]  I've been extremely busy with my eFoods Direct Storable Foods Department at the hardware store.
[01:25:59.056 --> 01:26:01.137]  And other than that, what have I been doing?
[01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:06.479]  Well, we got our own economic stimulus package back in March.
[01:26:06.479 --> 01:26:07.259]  We had a hailstorm.
[01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:15.216]  Because my store makes window screens, we have been literally inundated with work.
[01:26:15.216 --> 01:26:17.798]  We're just drowning in it.
[01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:19.339]  But I can't thank Obama for that.
[01:26:19.339 --> 01:26:21.241]  I think it was Mother Nature.
[01:26:21.241 --> 01:26:21.641]  Really?
[01:26:21.641 --> 01:26:22.061]  Are you sure?
[01:26:22.061 --> 01:26:26.465]  Because Bill Gates' patenting device aimed at halting hurricanes right now.
[01:26:26.465 --> 01:26:29.708]  Well, maybe he can mess up some more screens or something.
[01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:30.889]  Send some more hail around.
[01:26:32.836 --> 01:26:39.405]  You know, the difference, this is an interesting comparison because, you know, the economic stimulus package, as we all know, is a crock, right?
[01:26:39.405 --> 01:26:43.991]  Well, our economic stimulus package for the hardware store was real world.
[01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:50.400]  You had to take raw materials, which we purchased with capital, and then with labor we convert them into a product.
[01:26:50.979 --> 01:26:56.822]  Which is a screen, which we can sell in the open market to somebody who doesn't have to buy it from me, right?
[01:26:56.822 --> 01:27:02.984]  You mean a product that's produced here in the United States, made here in the United States, and used by somebody here in the United States?
[01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.845]  Right, and I actually make them myself.
[01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:07.366]  Me and one other guy make these things.
[01:27:07.366 --> 01:27:08.647]  And it's like, it's really real.
[01:27:08.647 --> 01:27:10.308]  You're not outsourcing to Indonesia?
[01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:10.548]  No.
[01:27:10.548 --> 01:27:11.268]  You promise?
[01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:12.328]  I promise, I swear.
[01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:13.609]  I don't have any Indians.
[01:27:13.609 --> 01:27:14.950]  Is that the simple truth?
[01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:15.730]  The simple truth.
[01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:17.430]  No, that's the TV show.
[01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:19.271]  He's giving me a plug for the TV show.
[01:27:19.271 --> 01:27:23.812]  Yeah, my TV show has been off the air for a few months because they're remodeling the studio.
[01:27:23.812 --> 01:27:24.572]  Oh, are they really?
[01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.412]  Yeah.
[01:27:25.412 --> 01:27:26.853]  I haven't been down there in a long time.
[01:27:26.853 --> 01:27:29.854]  Well, they're remodeling the studio, so we're theoretically going to be back.
[01:27:29.854 --> 01:27:32.054]  Oh, by the way, the website's up.
[01:27:32.054 --> 01:27:34.435]  That's simpletruthonline.net.
[01:27:34.435 --> 01:27:42.117]  You can go to simpletruthonline.net and watch some of our shows, which are archived there in the TV reports section.
[01:27:42.117 --> 01:27:42.277]  Oh, cool.
[01:27:42.817 --> 01:27:43.877]  Very cool.
[01:27:43.877 --> 01:27:44.638]  That's what I've been doing.
[01:27:44.638 --> 01:27:50.340]  Also, I've been doing a lot with the evil firearms because I have a small gun department.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:58.482]  Thank you, Lord Obama, for the tremendous gun sales that have happened since you got your phony election.
[01:27:58.482 --> 01:27:59.303]  Well, you better watch out.
[01:27:59.303 --> 01:28:00.103]  Sotomayor!
[01:28:00.103 --> 01:28:01.043]  She's coming to town!
[01:28:01.043 --> 01:28:02.024]  Oh, Sotomayor.
[01:28:02.024 --> 01:28:02.824]  I mean, she's great.
[01:28:05.052 --> 01:28:09.134]  Well you know what, let's save the Sotomayor stuff for the other group.
[01:28:09.134 --> 01:28:10.475]  This is a short segment.
[01:28:10.475 --> 01:28:17.339]  So let's go back to a couple callers, but I want to get big time into, I mean I've been watching some of these hearings, we've been taping them here, and where are the hard questions?
[01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:29.165]  Everybody wants to use that wise Latina woman quote, but that's scratching the surface of somebody who's a council member of La Raza and somebody who writes America's Deadly Obsession where it says, you know what, no guns for you!
[01:28:29.565 --> 01:28:30.385]  Oh, come on.
[01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:31.306]  Come on, Jason.
[01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:34.086]  There's nothing wrong with being a member of the United Race Party.
[01:28:34.086 --> 01:28:35.267]  Oh yeah, of course.
[01:28:35.267 --> 01:28:36.367]  Roy, in Indiana.
[01:28:36.367 --> 01:28:38.108]  You're back on the line, sir.
[01:28:38.108 --> 01:28:39.828]  Yes, thank you.
[01:28:39.828 --> 01:28:48.251]  The man that is running for the Senate seat in Nevada, who purposely quit his job, purposely to disthrone us, Harry Reid.
[01:28:48.251 --> 01:28:51.952]  And he gave me the ability to kind of put this out for him.
[01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:55.013]  So he gave me his personal home landline number.
[01:28:55.746 --> 01:29:03.353]  So what I want to do is you email me Jason and I'll send you the information and you guys can head butt heads and see about an interview.
[01:29:03.663 --> 01:29:04.463]  All right, well, you know what?
[01:29:04.463 --> 01:29:07.264]  Just email that to jason at infowars.com.
[01:29:07.264 --> 01:29:11.606]  That'll actually go to producer Jason Douglas, and him and Rob Dew will set it up.
[01:29:11.606 --> 01:29:12.686]  I thank you for the call, Roy.
[01:29:12.686 --> 01:29:17.248]  We are always looking for people to stand up and take part in the actual political process.
[01:29:17.248 --> 01:29:21.029]  You know, that's what organizations like Campaign for Liberty are about.
[01:29:21.029 --> 01:29:30.012]  You know, get a local council spot, run for Congress, become a state senator, or in this case, take on Harry Reid, who really just, you know, he, talk about controlled opposition.
[01:29:30.834 --> 01:29:31.354]  What is this?
[01:29:31.354 --> 01:29:33.675]  We got Blue Monday in my ears right now?
[01:29:33.675 --> 01:29:34.075]  Jones.
[01:29:34.075 --> 01:29:34.976]  I don't know, buddy.
[01:29:34.976 --> 01:29:36.456]  I don't know.
[01:29:36.456 --> 01:29:37.356]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:37.356 --> 01:29:38.997]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:38.997 --> 01:29:41.938]  We're in studio with Bob Dacey and Bob Chapman.
[01:29:41.938 --> 01:29:44.859]  We'll have Bob and Bob at the top of the hour.
[01:29:44.859 --> 01:29:51.381]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:51.381 --> 01:29:52.762]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.762 --> 01:29:55.303]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.303 --> 01:29:58.004]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.779 --> 01:30:06.642]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:30:06.642 --> 01:30:07.942]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:30:07.942 --> 01:30:12.224]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[01:30:12.224 --> 01:30:14.085]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:30:14.085 --> 01:30:20.388]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:30:21.528 --> 01:30:24.389]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:30:24.389 --> 01:30:26.130]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:29.131]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:30:29.131 --> 01:30:30.852]  And their formula really works.
[01:30:30.852 --> 01:30:33.673]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:30:33.673 --> 01:30:35.154]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:30:35.154 --> 01:30:39.936]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[01:30:39.936 --> 01:30:42.337]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:30:42.337 --> 01:30:44.578]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:30:44.798 --> 01:30:46.880]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:52.584]  Go to www.enerfood.com.

[01:31:00.902 --> 01:31:06.104]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:10.146]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.146 --> 01:31:16.029]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:16.029 --> 01:31:16.689]  It's true.
[01:31:16.689 --> 01:31:21.111]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.111 --> 01:31:27.635]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:31:27.635 --> 01:31:30.776]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:31:30.776 --> 01:31:30.996]  We're good.
[01:32:00.922 --> 01:32:06.624]  ...rounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:32:06.624 --> 01:32:08.425]  Take a deep breath.
[01:32:08.425 --> 01:32:14.927]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:32:14.927 --> 01:32:16.487]  Have a glass of water.
[01:32:16.487 --> 01:32:21.789]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:32:23.695 --> 01:32:24.175]  We're good to go.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:48.880]  Much more.

[01:33:11.656 --> 01:33:18.642]  We are back, it's the Alex Jones Show, I'm Jason Verma sitting in, riding shotgun is Bob Dacey, streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:33:18.642 --> 01:33:26.690]  We're going to go to Chris, John, Larry and others in this long segment, but first I want to talk about this process of confirming Judge Sotomayor.
[01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:29.973]  It looks like that is the process, I mean there's really no debate
[01:33:30.653 --> 01:33:35.837]  They use the same point over and over again, the wise Latina woman, the wise Latina woman.
[01:33:35.837 --> 01:33:38.500]  The false left-right paradigm then feeds into that.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:46.246]  You know, you watch Rachel Maddow or you watch Keith Olbermann and they over and over again make the point that that's what they're focusing on.
[01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:58.776]  But they're not focusing on the La Raza council membership, they're not focusing on the Belizean Grove, and they're obviously not focusing on America's deadly obsession where she says that we don't have the right to have guns.
[01:33:59.136 --> 01:34:00.578]  Well, it's not just guns.
[01:34:00.578 --> 01:34:02.740]  What's her stance on abortion?
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.662]  Has she clarified that?
[01:34:04.662 --> 01:34:06.404]  You know, I haven't watched all the hearings, so I couldn't tell you.
[01:34:06.404 --> 01:34:06.984]  Well, I think she hasn't.
[01:34:06.984 --> 01:34:09.507]  I think she's been dancing around everything like they always do.
[01:34:09.507 --> 01:34:11.209]  I mean, it's a dog and pony show.
[01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:17.515]  The woman is an elitist shill, just like all the rest of them, and it's just for our entertainment.
[01:34:17.515 --> 01:34:18.677]  But the Second Amendment?
[01:34:18.677 --> 01:34:19.598]  I mean, what is that?
[01:34:19.598 --> 01:34:20.318]  We don't need that.
[01:34:20.318 --> 01:34:21.520]  Obama's president now.
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:24.602]  Yeah, no, we have biomass-eating robots.
[01:34:24.602 --> 01:34:25.642]  Why would we need firearms?
[01:34:25.642 --> 01:34:26.323]  We don't need firearms.
[01:34:26.323 --> 01:34:28.364]  We'll just send them in after the bad guys.
[01:34:28.364 --> 01:34:31.106]  They might hurt the biomass-eating robots.
[01:34:31.106 --> 01:34:31.786]  You know?
[01:34:31.786 --> 01:34:37.750]  I mean, what's Sotomayor's position on the Second Amendment is, oh yeah, I have friends who hunt.
[01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:39.031]  Isn't that what people used to say?
[01:34:39.031 --> 01:34:41.253]  Well, I know people that are black.
[01:34:41.253 --> 01:34:41.573]  Okay?
[01:34:41.573 --> 01:34:42.774]  Does that make me okay?
[01:34:42.774 --> 01:34:44.375]  You know, I have friends that hunt.
[01:34:45.214 --> 01:34:47.576]  Well, what does hunting have to do with the Second Amendment?
[01:34:47.576 --> 01:34:48.257]  Tell me.
[01:34:48.257 --> 01:34:52.720]  And not only that, you know, again, she tries to skirt the issue, but then she doesn't answer the question whatsoever.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.881]  She just says, I have friends who hunt.
[01:34:53.881 --> 01:34:55.903]  It doesn't mean she's in favor of that either.
[01:34:55.903 --> 01:34:57.304]  Well, Jason, you're from New York, right?
[01:34:57.304 --> 01:35:01.027]  Well, I would have to excuse you not knowing as much about hunting as people from Texas.
[01:35:01.027 --> 01:35:03.029]  You would think that, but I have deer everywhere.
[01:35:03.029 --> 01:35:03.449]  Deer?
[01:35:03.449 --> 01:35:04.090]  Oh, my God.
[01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:06.352]  I've been in four different car accidents with deer.
[01:35:06.352 --> 01:35:07.513]  They're all over the place.
[01:35:07.513 --> 01:35:08.533]  It's big enough, state of New York.
[01:35:08.533 --> 01:35:11.716]  All the city folk come up to the Catskill Mountains to shoot the deer.
[01:35:11.716 --> 01:35:13.477]  Now, I've been around the whole dressing situation.
[01:35:14.198 --> 01:35:17.079]  I'll throw it on the back and the whole night.
[01:35:17.079 --> 01:35:19.139]  The Second Amendment has nothing to do with hunting, do you?
[01:35:19.139 --> 01:35:19.900]  Nothing.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:20.360]  No.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.701]  The right of hunters to stalk and shoot bambi shall not be infringed.
[01:35:23.701 --> 01:35:25.621]  I mean, where does it say that in the Constitution?
[01:35:25.621 --> 01:35:26.361]  In fact, it doesn't.
[01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:33.744]  It actually reflects that the people are the militia, that they're the ones that are in charge of upholding the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:35:33.744 --> 01:35:34.144]  Absolutely.
[01:35:34.144 --> 01:35:38.845]  And if a government gets too tyrannical, they then have the right to rise up against that government.
[01:35:39.245 --> 01:35:48.389]  I remember years ago, Susanna Hupp, whose parents were killed in the Killeen Lubies many years ago because she didn't have her gun in her purse.
[01:35:48.389 --> 01:35:51.431]  That's what got concealed carry in Texas going.
[01:35:51.431 --> 01:35:55.853]  You know, she was in the Lubies without her gun because it was illegal to have it and her parents got blown away.
[01:35:55.853 --> 01:35:57.314]  But it's not, right?
[01:35:57.314 --> 01:35:59.034]  Well, she was testifying before the U.S.
[01:35:59.034 --> 01:36:04.217]  Congress many years ago, right in front of Chuckie Schumer, my favorite then-Congressman, now-Senator.
[01:36:04.857 --> 01:36:14.164]  And she looked at him and she said, quote, I'm not going to be very popular in this room by saying this, but the Second Amendment has nothing to do with duck hunting.
[01:36:14.164 --> 01:36:19.408]  It's about people like me being able to protect ourselves from people like you.
[01:36:19.408 --> 01:36:20.529]  And that's exactly right.
[01:36:20.529 --> 01:36:23.972]  And Chucky was fuming, you could see the steam coming out of his ears.
[01:36:23.972 --> 01:36:25.833]  Now that's what the Second Amendment is all about.
[01:36:25.833 --> 01:36:32.078]  And when Sotomayor says, oh, I have friends who hunt, that is irrelevant to the Second Amendment.
[01:36:32.078 --> 01:36:33.159]  Completely irrelevant.
[01:36:33.399 --> 01:36:39.144]  You know, I told a little bit of this story earlier, but I had my landlord come over and change my dryer out, and he's with his son.
[01:36:39.144 --> 01:36:42.827]  His son's joining the military, and he pulls out one of those utility knives.
[01:36:42.827 --> 01:36:44.328]  You know, one of the ones that's going to be banned.
[01:36:44.328 --> 01:36:45.409]  It's a switchblade now.
[01:36:45.409 --> 01:36:46.790]  It's more than four inches.
[01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:49.953]  Eight out of ten knives are now getting banned in this country.
[01:36:49.953 --> 01:36:52.655]  Just totally sick, totally disgusting, totally degrading.
[01:36:52.655 --> 01:36:54.797]  And I mentioned it to him, and he's well aware of it.
[01:36:54.797 --> 01:36:56.759]  He's like, ah, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:36:56.759 --> 01:36:57.820]  Military's exempt.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.521]  And I'm like, well, guess what?
[01:37:00.521 --> 01:37:01.522]  It matters to me.
[01:37:01.522 --> 01:37:05.804]  Why should the military even have knives that I'm not allowed to have?
[01:37:05.804 --> 01:37:06.405]  Absolutely.
[01:37:06.405 --> 01:37:14.969]  And during the actual Revolutionary War, if you want to get down to just the statistics of it, the militia guys mostly carried rifles.
[01:37:14.969 --> 01:37:16.210]  Barrels that are rifled.
[01:37:16.210 --> 01:37:16.990]  More accurate.
[01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:19.832]  The guys in the British Army or whatnot, they carried a brown vest musket.
[01:37:19.832 --> 01:37:21.273]  It was a smoothbore musket.
[01:37:21.273 --> 01:37:24.995]  You pointed in a general direction and there was enough of you fired in the right spot, you hit somebody.
[01:37:25.515 --> 01:37:29.277]  So the militia actually had better weapons than the regular army.
[01:37:29.277 --> 01:37:30.898]  Yeah, that'll never be the case again.
[01:37:30.898 --> 01:37:33.460]  Whoa, come on now, so why can't we?
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:40.324]  Yeah, no, I agree and I was making, you know, I talked to him about the XM-25 and the smart bullets and the technology that the military is openly using now.
[01:37:41.252 --> 01:37:48.757]  And I think that we've gone into such a technocracy, it would be impossible for the people ever to compete in a military sense.
[01:37:48.757 --> 01:37:53.080]  However, that doesn't say that we should just turn in our guns and bow down to our masters.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.522]  We still have to, A, keep away the police state.
[01:37:55.522 --> 01:37:58.584]  We have to keep the military and the police separate.
[01:37:58.584 --> 01:38:00.585]  I mean, that's common.
[01:38:00.585 --> 01:38:03.187]  You know, posse comitatus is there for a reason.
[01:38:03.187 --> 01:38:05.449]  And as much as they try to tear down that idea,
[01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:07.290]  We have to keep up holding.
[01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:07.990]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:14.374]  And you know, another thing Sotomayor has said is that, you know, she has somebody, some relative of hers is in the NRA.
[01:38:14.374 --> 01:38:15.795]  Ooh, what is the NRA?
[01:38:15.795 --> 01:38:19.077]  I mean, all they do is promote shooting sports and things.
[01:38:19.077 --> 01:38:25.481]  They're pretty wimpy, really, if you really get right down to it, on the real purpose of the Second Amendment.
[01:38:25.481 --> 01:38:27.462]  They want to protect the hunters and the shooters.
[01:38:27.462 --> 01:38:32.826]  And every once in a while they'll say something nice about personal self-defense, but they're not real, real good about
[01:38:33.386 --> 01:38:35.087]  The real core meaning of the Second Amendment.
[01:38:35.087 --> 01:38:39.630]  Well that's why we support GunOwners.org here at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:03.826 --> 01:39:05.987]  Green labels.
[01:39:05.987 --> 01:39:10.149]  I hope they don't have the wrong kind of dye in the green labels.
[01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:17.351]  You know what, I'm sure they'll make them look really earthy, but they'll still be put together by Indonesian kids in some far-off third-world country.
[01:39:17.351 --> 01:39:21.253]  Well, unless the Indonesian kids start to make more money than the kids they can find someplace else.
[01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:22.593]  Well, that's really the point, isn't it?
[01:39:22.593 --> 01:39:25.554]  Isn't it to bring everybody to kind of second-world status?
[01:39:25.554 --> 01:39:27.775]  I mean, let's look at China as an example.
[01:39:28.075 --> 01:39:30.377]  You know, in the 80s, they got the Coca-Cola.
[01:39:30.377 --> 01:39:31.838]  They got the Levi's jeans.
[01:39:31.838 --> 01:39:33.259]  They got the McDonald's.
[01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:34.760]  You know, they westernized a little bit.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.180]  Not much.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.021]  They still had their one-child policies.
[01:39:37.021 --> 01:39:38.502]  They still had their police state.
[01:39:38.502 --> 01:39:41.104]  They still have their ultimate rulers, their dictatorship.
[01:39:41.104 --> 01:39:42.425]  The military are the police there.
[01:39:42.425 --> 01:39:43.565]  They still have that.
[01:39:43.565 --> 01:39:47.228]  But then you look at the United States, and what have we taken from their culture?
[01:39:47.228 --> 01:39:51.271]  Well, now suddenly it's okay to have the military on the streets.
[01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:52.932]  Suddenly it's okay to have youth groups.
[01:39:52.932 --> 01:39:56.114]  Suddenly we're talking about bio and geoengineering.
[01:39:56.114 --> 01:39:57.995]  Suddenly we're talking about one-child policies.
[01:39:58.195 --> 01:39:59.638]  What do you got against youth groups?
[01:39:59.638 --> 01:40:02.904]  Oh yeah, youth brigades are always good when they're state sponsored.
[01:40:02.904 --> 01:40:04.387]  You know what I've always said about teenagers?
[01:40:04.387 --> 01:40:08.154]  I hope I don't offend any teenagers, but teenagers are the dumbest people on the planet.
[01:40:09.287 --> 01:40:10.688]  I disagree with you there.
[01:40:10.688 --> 01:40:12.129]  It wasn't so long ago.
[01:40:12.129 --> 01:40:15.051]  I will tell you why teenagers are the dumbest people on the planet.
[01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:17.553]  Because a 10 year old knows he doesn't know anything.
[01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:18.874]  He realizes it.
[01:40:18.874 --> 01:40:21.576]  A teenager doesn't know anything either, but he thinks he knows everything.
[01:40:21.576 --> 01:40:24.358]  Therefore, he's some of the dumbest people on the planet.
[01:40:24.358 --> 01:40:29.422]  I guess I'm not going to say I wasn't cocky and arrogant as a teenager, but I know plenty of Middle East people I was smarter than even then.
[01:40:29.702 --> 01:40:31.343]  And that was over a decade ago.
[01:40:31.343 --> 01:40:33.044]  I'm going to be 30 in like two weeks.
[01:40:33.044 --> 01:40:34.464]  Well, you're an exception to the rule.
[01:40:34.464 --> 01:40:35.325]  Oh, exception to the rule.
[01:40:35.325 --> 01:40:39.106]  Most teenagers are dumb because they think they're smart and they don't know anything.
[01:40:39.106 --> 01:40:43.948]  Listen, yeah, but the thing is that their parents in most cases are just as dumb, especially nowadays.
[01:40:43.948 --> 01:40:45.909]  They're like, look at my SUV.
[01:40:45.909 --> 01:40:56.194]  Let's take the example, you know, five, ten years ago, they're the ones driving this Eddie Bauer mobile, trying to be like socially acceptable at the soccer mom circles and over at the kids games and what's socially
[01:40:56.694 --> 01:41:04.301]  Let's talk about the latest sports team, and the college game that was on last night, and look at the bumper sticker I have, or the pennant on my car.
[01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:06.462]  Jason, Jason, look, look.
[01:41:06.462 --> 01:41:09.665]  Kids' sports can be relevant to current politics.
[01:41:09.665 --> 01:41:10.385]  And how's that?
[01:41:10.385 --> 01:41:14.609]  Because when I was younger and my kids were little, I was a soccer coach.
[01:41:14.609 --> 01:41:17.351]  And you know what I had to carry with me when we went to tournaments?
[01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:19.073]  When we registered our kids to play in tournaments?
[01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:23.176]  I had to carry a folder on each kid which included the kid's birth certificate.
[01:41:23.456 --> 01:41:23.916]  Really?
[01:41:23.916 --> 01:41:27.237]  Yeah, because you had to prove your kid was eligible to play in the league.
[01:41:27.237 --> 01:41:29.958]  Because lots of parents would try to play their kid down to make them look good.
[01:41:29.958 --> 01:41:30.658]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:30.658 --> 01:41:34.780]  So you had to carry the kid's birth certificate in order to play little kid soccer.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:37.961]  But to be president, you don't gotta pony up your birth certificate.
[01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:40.943]  There's relevance here.
[01:41:40.943 --> 01:41:41.743]  I guess there's relevance.
[01:41:41.743 --> 01:41:52.091]  Well, you know what, there's also, and I think that the reason that people latch on to sports is because we really don't have anything else where we get together and we go for a common goal and you have that adrenaline rush.
[01:41:52.091 --> 01:42:01.678]  I think sports actually does teach a lot of kids discipline and respect and goal-orientated behavior, you know, reach out for that goal, work hard for it.
[01:42:01.678 --> 01:42:06.262]  But the problem is, a lot of that does not go into the real world beyond
[01:42:06.562 --> 01:42:15.331]  You know, they lose it as they go to college or they get that first job, and then they try to latch onto it again by thinking that they're part of the Yankees or the Mets.
[01:42:15.331 --> 01:42:17.733]  They don't really learn the things that they learned.
[01:42:17.733 --> 01:42:22.918]  Again, coming together, common goals, the greater good, you know, working towards a goal.
[01:42:22.918 --> 01:42:27.383]  Instead, they're like, the goal they're working towards is to see their team win the pennant.
[01:42:27.383 --> 01:42:29.925]  And even you, in your analysis there,
[01:42:30.606 --> 01:42:42.158]  We're gonna get into this Facebook police raided my family a barbecue.
[01:42:42.158 --> 01:42:43.680]  We've reported on this before.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:46.162]  Federal agencies surveilling Facebook.
[01:42:46.162 --> 01:42:48.384]  Local police broke up a prom party.
[01:42:48.384 --> 01:42:49.946]  They're like, no New Jersey kids.
[01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:51.787]  No prom party for you.
[01:42:51.787 --> 01:42:53.207]  How dare you put it on Facebook?
[01:42:53.207 --> 01:42:54.248]  And this is even worse.
[01:42:54.248 --> 01:42:56.909]  This is a SWAT team saying it was a raid.
[01:42:56.909 --> 01:42:57.589]  Guns drawn.
[01:42:57.589 --> 01:43:00.070]  We're going to get into that in a moment, but we're going to take some calls.
[01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:01.150]  Chris in Missouri.
[01:43:01.150 --> 01:43:03.511]  Chris hung up, so we're going to go to John in Texas.
[01:43:03.511 --> 01:43:05.132]  John, you're on the line.
[01:43:05.132 --> 01:43:06.133]  Is that me?
[01:43:06.133 --> 01:43:07.333]  That's you.
[01:43:07.333 --> 01:43:08.293]  Okay.
[01:43:08.293 --> 01:43:11.435]  Are you taking any calls on 9-1-1?
[01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:13.676]  Let's hear what you got to say, sir.
[01:43:13.676 --> 01:43:18.758]  There's a website called Architects and Engineers for 9-1-1 Truth.
[01:43:18.758 --> 01:43:19.538]  Have you covered that?
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.544]  Oh of course, we've had Richard Gage on this program and my program several times.
[01:43:23.544 --> 01:43:25.906]  I've interviewed Stephen Jones on several occasions.
[01:43:25.906 --> 01:43:34.475]  We're well aware of the latest paperwork where they published the findings of unexploded thermite in the dust about three weeks ago.
[01:43:34.475 --> 01:43:36.197]  Big fans of their work.
[01:43:36.197 --> 01:43:39.400]  Okay, I can't get you in San Antonio.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.542]  What station are you on?
[01:43:41.089 --> 01:43:55.436]  We're on 90.1 over in Austin, Texas, but you can listen to us obviously streaming live now at InfoWars.com, or you can watch the video over at PrisonPlanet.tv, and I mean if you're just learning about this program... 90.1 on what now?
[01:43:55.436 --> 01:43:56.997]  90.1 in Austin, Texas, sir.
[01:43:56.997 --> 01:44:02.079]  I don't know if it's going to reach as long as San Antonio, unfortunately, but go to the web.
[01:44:02.079 --> 01:44:05.501]  That's straight line stuff energy, isn't it?
[01:44:05.501 --> 01:44:06.541]  What straight line energy?
[01:44:06.541 --> 01:44:08.082]  Probably not going to reach down here.
[01:44:08.877 --> 01:44:09.097]  No.
[01:44:09.097 --> 01:44:11.400]  You don't have a low frequency?
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.341]  I think there's a short wave.
[01:44:12.341 --> 01:44:14.343]  You got to go to the website to find out, sir.
[01:44:14.343 --> 01:44:15.104]  Thank you for the call.
[01:44:15.104 --> 01:44:16.185]  I hope that you can get in touch.
[01:44:16.185 --> 01:44:21.871]  It sounds like it's a newer listener if he doesn't know that this show promotes architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[01:44:21.871 --> 01:44:28.719]  Yeah, that last little bit that came out three weeks ago, I mean, why isn't that mainstream headlines all over the world?
[01:44:28.719 --> 01:44:30.000]  It might even be six weeks ago.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.062]  Seven weeks ago, yeah.
[01:44:31.062 --> 01:44:32.003]  However long ago it was.
[01:44:32.003 --> 01:44:41.197]  I mean, when you have unexploded super thermite in all the dust samples that are tested, and when the scientists put it in their little gizmo and they heat it up and it goes BOOM!
[01:44:42.469 --> 01:44:46.870]  I mean, this is unreal proof.
[01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:50.471]  This is like fingerprints all over the bloody knives everywhere.
[01:44:50.471 --> 01:44:53.752]  So why isn't it being covered by the mainstream media, Jason?
[01:44:53.752 --> 01:44:54.452]  I don't understand.
[01:44:54.452 --> 01:44:59.354]  Well, yeah, because the mainstream media is so good and they have our best interests at heart, so they have to lie to us sometimes.
[01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:03.955]  Yeah, well, maybe it's not in our best interest to know that superthermite
[01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:09.818]  Unexploded superthermite is all over the World Trade Center dust and we'd like an explanation.
[01:45:09.818 --> 01:45:10.678]  No, you don't understand.
[01:45:10.678 --> 01:45:17.241]  Planes cause buildings to fall on top of themselves in uniform fashion at unprecedented speeds.
[01:45:17.241 --> 01:45:19.502]  Even when they don't hit the building.
[01:45:19.502 --> 01:45:20.603]  Yes.
[01:45:20.603 --> 01:45:22.103]  Building 7, obviously.
[01:45:22.103 --> 01:45:22.683]  To fall down.
[01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:23.184]  Yes.
[01:45:23.184 --> 01:45:26.945]  But this superthermite thing, I mean, this is scientific, peer-reviewed.
[01:45:26.945 --> 01:45:32.428]  I mean, somebody tell me how unexploded superthermite got in the World Trade Center dust.
[01:45:32.588 --> 01:45:34.029]  Please, I would like to know.
[01:45:34.029 --> 01:45:39.033]  Well, let's talk for a second about that because, you know, we're almost eight years after 9-11.
[01:45:39.033 --> 01:45:48.101]  There have been zero, let me say that again, zero instances where quote-unquote terrorists were able to smuggle explosives into anywhere in the United States.
[01:45:48.101 --> 01:45:49.302]  However, the U.S.
[01:45:49.302 --> 01:45:53.926]  government, through drills and exercises, was able to get explosives into ten buildings.
[01:45:54.446 --> 01:45:55.407]  Over the last couple years.
[01:45:55.407 --> 01:45:55.967]  Amazing.
[01:45:55.967 --> 01:45:56.808]  That's weird.
[01:45:56.808 --> 01:45:59.009]  See, real people can't do it, Bob.
[01:45:59.009 --> 01:46:00.810]  And the terrorists can't do it.
[01:46:00.810 --> 01:46:03.452]  But the government seems to be able to do it.
[01:46:03.452 --> 01:46:08.155]  Obviously, Al Qaeda must be way more sophisticated than we think they are, boy.
[01:46:08.155 --> 01:46:12.598]  For them to be able to bring all that tons of super thermite into those buildings and hook it all up.
[01:46:12.598 --> 01:46:15.260]  And ram planes into there for no apparent reason.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:16.621]  Absolutely.
[01:46:16.621 --> 01:46:17.722]  It makes a ton of sense.
[01:46:17.722 --> 01:46:20.784]  It's a huge, huge uncovered story in the mainstream media.
[01:46:20.784 --> 01:46:22.285]  And they're still complicit with it.
[01:46:22.925 --> 01:46:24.966]  Completely, completely complicit.
[01:46:24.966 --> 01:46:26.247]  They're totally controlled.
[01:46:26.247 --> 01:46:27.167]  I absolutely agree.
[01:46:27.167 --> 01:46:28.187]  Larry in California.
[01:46:28.187 --> 01:46:29.808]  Larry, you're online.
[01:46:29.808 --> 01:46:31.369]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Jason.
[01:46:31.369 --> 01:46:33.290]  You got it.
[01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:35.791]  I just wanted to mention something.
[01:46:35.791 --> 01:46:51.718]  I actually had court the other day and I wanted to bring out how they're using the draft for young men that are in court for like child support and unemployed.
[01:46:51.718 --> 01:46:51.878]  I was
[01:46:53.041 --> 01:47:16.666]  Like, number 10 on the list to be called up, and every single guy before me, because I sat in the front row, I could hear everything the public defender guy could say and everything, and every young man that was up there was asked if he'd signed up for Selective Services, and they really kind of, it was like the guy was pushing it.
[01:47:17.748 --> 01:47:27.674]  So you really think that maybe they might be gearing up to open up either the draft, in other words, military conscription, or perhaps a military force in the United States where they would have to draft from?
[01:47:27.674 --> 01:47:31.876]  You know, they did just make DHS officially part of the NSA, Bob.
[01:47:31.876 --> 01:47:32.637]  No, they did?
[01:47:32.637 --> 01:47:33.737]  Oh, that makes me so happy.
[01:47:35.038 --> 01:47:53.021]  Not that it's much difference, but now they're just admitting that DHS is going to be absorbed by the National Security Agency and DHS was only put into place supposedly, even though it was on the shelf and the paperwork was all there and they just seem to spring this new administration into life, this new bureaucracy, because of 9-11, Bob.
[01:47:53.982 --> 01:47:59.448]  Yeah, the concept of the Department of Homeland Security, which sounds so Teutonic.
[01:47:59.448 --> 01:48:00.489]  A little Deutschland?
[01:48:00.489 --> 01:48:01.611]  Yeah, a little Deutschland.
[01:48:01.611 --> 01:48:06.216]  It was in place before September 11th and they used it as an excuse.
[01:48:06.216 --> 01:48:07.157]  Period.
[01:48:07.157 --> 01:48:08.058]  That's not even debatable.
[01:48:09.159 --> 01:48:09.780]  I'm with you.
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:12.381]  We're going to go to Tray in Texas in just a moment, but I want to read this story.
[01:48:12.381 --> 01:48:15.363]  Facebook police raided my family barbecue.
[01:48:15.363 --> 01:48:18.005]  You don't think they're surveilling what's on the internet?
[01:48:18.005 --> 01:48:22.588]  Folks, people are profiling themselves on another level more than ever before, Bob.
[01:48:22.588 --> 01:48:32.454]  What they're doing is they're putting out every 15 minutes, this is my status, this is my mood, I'm over here, I'm over there, text me, I'm twittering from the mall, you know.
[01:48:32.834 --> 01:48:43.044]  Yeah, literally people are giving Big Brother what they want on another level and then somebody like this who thinks that Facebook is just fun and games and he's going to just be able to network with 15 or 20 friends.
[01:48:43.044 --> 01:48:52.894]  Riot police stormed a 30th birthday party for just 15 people and shut it down thinking it was a rave because it was advertised on Facebook.
[01:48:52.894 --> 01:48:54.535]  Hey, it's my birthday party.
[01:48:54.535 --> 01:48:55.656]  Everybody come down.
[01:48:56.497 --> 01:48:57.438]  SWAT team.
[01:48:57.438 --> 01:49:05.322]  Four police cars, a riot van, and a helicopter were involved in a swoop on Andrew Poole's gathering for his family and friends.
[01:49:05.322 --> 01:49:08.564]  He was just about to light the barbecue and had not even turned on the music.
[01:49:08.564 --> 01:49:16.189]  Hadn't even put up the music yet when the gazebo suddenly started flipping wildly and the sound of a chopper blade filled the air.
[01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:24.234]  Eight officers wearing camouflage trousers and body armor jumped out and demanded that the rave be shut down.
[01:49:24.694 --> 01:49:28.038]  Mr. Poole said we were nowhere near anyone, we weren't even playing music.
[01:49:28.038 --> 01:49:32.964]  What effectively the police did was come in and stop 15 people eating burgers.
[01:49:32.964 --> 01:49:34.606]  They didn't even- they weren't even invited, huh?
[01:49:36.081 --> 01:49:40.282]  The party was organized using the Create an Event facility on Facebook.
[01:49:40.282 --> 01:49:42.642]  And you've seen, I don't know, are you on the Facebook?
[01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:43.162]  No.
[01:49:43.162 --> 01:49:44.063]  You're not on the Facebook?
[01:49:44.063 --> 01:49:44.463]  No.
[01:49:44.463 --> 01:49:45.863]  I'm on the Facebook.
[01:49:45.863 --> 01:49:52.244]  And personally I prefer MySpace because there's too much of these apps and these events and become a fan type things on Facebook.
[01:49:52.244 --> 01:50:01.566]  But I'll tell you what, I found some of my top news stories, not from the Routers Wire, although I pulled a lot from the Routers Wire, but from my little Facebook profile that people post on.
[01:50:01.566 --> 01:50:05.027]  And we actually had, who was it, Congressman Joseph Pitts
[01:50:05.707 --> 01:50:11.230]  Doing a one-minute speech on the House floor about abortion, eugenics, and population control.
[01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:13.090]  Yeah, it was really good.
[01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:15.371]  And that's what I use the Facebook for.
[01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:18.172]  I don't use it to do these events and let people spy on me.
[01:50:18.172 --> 01:50:19.753]  I don't update my mood.
[01:50:19.753 --> 01:50:30.838]  I tend not to post pictures of myself, but then I'll go to an event, like I'll go to New York for one of my alumni weekends, and all of a sudden there's 20 pictures of me drinking beer on the Internet, you know?
[01:50:31.198 --> 01:50:37.184]  So, people don't realize, and that's just, you know, one or two events, you know, during the year.
[01:50:37.184 --> 01:50:39.446]  Some people post weekly on this thing.
[01:50:39.446 --> 01:50:41.588]  Like, every weekend, they're posting all their pictures.
[01:50:41.588 --> 01:50:45.953]  They don't understand the negative effects, the impact of that, the Big Brother aspect.
[01:50:45.953 --> 01:50:48.395]  So, we're going to get into that on the other side.
[01:50:48.395 --> 01:50:50.798]  Facebook, police raided my family barbecue.
[01:50:50.798 --> 01:50:51.679]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:51.679 --> 01:50:54.541]  I'm Jason Bermas, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:51:01.733 --> 01:51:07.535]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:51:07.535 --> 01:51:15.118]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:51:15.118 --> 01:51:21.281]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:51:21.701 --> 01:51:23.682]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:51:23.682 --> 01:51:26.182]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:51:26.182 --> 01:51:37.765]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:51:37.765 --> 01:51:39.426]  It's not about left or right.
[01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.286]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:51:41.286 --> 01:51:47.528]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:56.463]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:56.463 --> 01:51:58.044]  The Obama Deception.
[01:51:58.044 --> 01:51:59.224]  The people strike back.
[01:52:12.970 --> 01:52:14.771]  We're good to go.
[01:52:44.284 --> 01:52:44.624]  We're good.
[01:53:01.673 --> 01:53:07.177]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:53:07.177 --> 01:53:07.978]  and the world.
[01:53:07.978 --> 01:53:11.841]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:53:11.841 --> 01:53:18.346]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:53:18.346 --> 01:53:20.367]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:53:20.367 --> 01:53:25.591]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:26.071]  I think so.
[01:53:41.318 --> 01:53:41.598]  I think so.
[01:54:05.879 --> 01:54:08.281]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:08.281 --> 01:54:12.685]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:12.685 --> 01:54:15.308]  Alright folks, once again we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:15.308 --> 01:54:17.089]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[01:54:17.089 --> 01:54:23.195]  We are with Bob Dacey in studio streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv and we're going over this Facebook story.
[01:54:24.195 --> 01:54:25.935]  Apparently, they shut the whole thing down.
[01:54:25.935 --> 01:54:29.196]  I mean, they didn't say, oh, it looks like there's only 15 people here.
[01:54:29.196 --> 01:54:33.338]  No, they came in, guns a-blazin', helicopters swooped in.
[01:54:33.338 --> 01:54:37.919]  Eight people, think about that, eight police officers for 15 people.
[01:54:37.919 --> 01:54:43.460]  That's a little better than a two-to-one ratio, actually, Bob, and two cops for every person.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:50.882]  I guess Mr. Poole said he spent, this is out in the UK, by the way, he spent 800 pounds on food and a refrigerator.
[01:54:50.882 --> 01:54:52.923]  You know, he tried to cater the event, and they didn't like it.
[01:54:53.243 --> 01:54:57.629]  They didn't like how I was being advertised on the internet as an all-night party.
[01:54:57.629 --> 01:55:09.706]  So this is Big Brother in every sense of the word, and what people have to understand is when they join a group or they become a fan of something, sometimes these are undercover officers posing as other people so that they can see you in their little newsfeed.
[01:55:10.387 --> 01:55:15.309]  Okay, and they are tracking and tracing and databasing all these kids.
[01:55:15.309 --> 01:55:18.891]  And it's not just kids because this is something that's, I mean, this is a 30 year old guy.
[01:55:18.891 --> 01:55:19.992]  I would hardly call him a kid.
[01:55:19.992 --> 01:55:21.613]  This is his 30th birthday party.
[01:55:21.613 --> 01:55:31.797]  And this is a social networking site that, you know, more and more middle-aged and older people are using because they see the power of it as yet another tool to enslave or empower.
[01:55:31.797 --> 01:55:32.818]  But this is just outrageous.
[01:55:32.978 --> 01:55:35.439]  I don't know, why don't they just go out and fight some real crime or something?
[01:55:35.439 --> 01:55:39.721]  I mean, you know, cops in the country all the time do something stupid.
[01:55:39.721 --> 01:55:43.282]  You know, here in Austin, several years ago, Alex was all over this.
[01:55:43.282 --> 01:55:52.346]  Some lady out in West Austin somewhere gets this helicopter SWAT team stomping on her property because some fool thought that she was growing marijuana in her backyard.
[01:55:52.346 --> 01:55:57.128]  I mean, they got a SWAT team, helicopters, guns drawn the whole nine yards, ordering everybody to the ground.
[01:55:57.748 --> 01:56:01.950]  To inspect what turned out to be a real common weed that grows all over Texas.
[01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:06.232]  And this was the Sheriff's Department under... I forgot the name.
[01:56:06.232 --> 01:56:07.912]  And this was just an old woman, right?
[01:56:07.912 --> 01:56:09.373]  Yeah, just an old lady.
[01:56:09.373 --> 01:56:10.954]  And here comes the SWAT team.
[01:56:10.954 --> 01:56:12.074]  Well, it shouldn't be a surprise.
[01:56:12.074 --> 01:56:25.280]  I mean, HR 1444 is now being passed around Congress where they're not only talking about compulsory service, they're talking about specifically getting the baby boomer generation involved in this compulsory service and how they'll fit in.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.100]  Oh boy, I can't wait.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:32.764]  Yeah, 60 plus year old people should really have to serve in a city or some other kind of a AmeriCorps Brigade.
[01:56:32.764 --> 01:56:36.906]  Or we can pick up the aluminum cans and donate them to the cause or something.
[01:56:36.906 --> 01:56:38.147]  Alright, let's go to some calls.
[01:56:38.147 --> 01:56:39.688]  Let's go to Trey in Texas.
[01:56:39.688 --> 01:56:41.589]  Trey, you're on the line.
[01:56:41.589 --> 01:56:44.010]  Jason, did they have a permit for that burger party?
[01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:51.504]  Oh, do you think that somebody should have to have a permit for 15 people eating burgers in the country?
[01:56:51.504 --> 01:57:05.896]  I mean, you look at the shot, and I don't know if these guys, this got brought into me so I didn't send them a link on PrisonPlanet.tv, but it's a small blue tent, I think, in the small blue tent they're showing you a very minimalized sound system that was not even plugged in yet.
[01:57:05.896 --> 01:57:12.422]  This is 4pm when they got raided, they didn't even plug in the music, but there's trees everywhere, it doesn't even look like the guy has neighbors.
[01:57:13.450 --> 01:57:16.853]  Oh, but how dare they assemble without permission?
[01:57:16.853 --> 01:57:20.356]  Maybe they raided the place because they were cooking meat.
[01:57:20.356 --> 01:57:22.518]  And we all know meat is not sustainable.
[01:57:22.518 --> 01:57:24.640]  That's true.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.281]  What else you got for me, Trey?
[01:57:26.281 --> 01:57:36.950]  Jason, I was watching the Today Show yesterday morning and there was a short segment where they were commenting that Hillary has been noticeably absent recently for many of her typical duties.
[01:57:37.816 --> 01:57:55.785]  They cut to a short scene of Hillary speaking with Senator Rockefeller in preparation to provide a briefing to President Obama, and in between the phrases of the voiceover of the Today Show correspondent, you can clearly hear what Hillary is saying to Senator Rockefeller in the background.
[01:57:55.785 --> 01:58:02.368]  And what she said was, I have been briefing the interagency on what has been going on inside the camps.
[01:58:03.654 --> 01:58:19.001]  I can only speculate as to what she's referring to, but of course I hit record on the TiVo and watched it several times, and you know, some of these people have this perverse pleasure from publicly displaying their power.
[01:58:19.001 --> 01:58:20.101]  I just thought it was rather odd.
[01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:24.703]  Well, you know, her talking to Rockefeller kind of makes me think that this might be a cyber security thing or her absence.
[01:58:24.703 --> 01:58:27.245]  I mean, we know that he's starting a new cyber security office.
[01:58:27.245 --> 01:58:29.646]  We know that he has somebody in mind as a quote-unquote czar.
[01:58:30.646 --> 01:58:33.267]  So, without seeing the clip, I really can't make any comments.
[01:58:33.267 --> 01:58:34.348]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:34.348 --> 01:58:35.829]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[01:58:35.829 --> 01:58:36.829]  We'll be back after this.
[01:58:36.829 --> 01:58:41.172]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com.

[01:58:53.999 --> 01:58:54.659]  Well, you should.

[01:58:59.462 --> 01:58:59.922]  That's right.

[01:59:15.925 --> 01:59:24.511]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:59:24.511 --> 01:59:30.035]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:59:30.035 --> 01:59:31.496]  This is real.

[02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:22.282]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.282 --> 02:00:23.362]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[02:00:23.362 --> 02:00:24.323]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:24.323 --> 02:00:25.464]  I'm Jason Verma, sitting in
[02:00:25.984 --> 02:00:27.545]  I want to thank a couple of great sponsors.
[02:00:27.545 --> 02:00:29.966]  Again, these sponsors are what makes the show possible.
[02:00:29.966 --> 02:00:31.807]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:00:31.807 --> 02:00:35.629]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.989]  877-327-0365.
[02:00:35.989 --> 02:00:49.116]  If you want non-GMO, real heirloom seeds, I mean, whether you're looking to stock up, feed your family, just have a nice little victory garden in the yard, SurvivalSeedBank.com is the place to go.
[02:00:49.116 --> 02:00:49.256]  877-327-0365.
[02:00:49.256 --> 02:00:50.817]  And, of course, our sponsor, New Seeds.
[02:00:55.279 --> 02:00:55.679]  I think so.
[02:01:18.049 --> 02:01:27.292]  You know, let's close up with this Facebook thing, but it really just shows how we've been trained, Bob, to give out all of our personal information.
[02:01:27.292 --> 02:01:30.813]  Again, there's nothing sacred, nothing private anymore.
[02:01:30.813 --> 02:01:44.297]  And then it gives the opportunity to law enforcement, Big Brother, whoever, to then track, trace, and database, and really profile us on a level never seen before, which sometimes results in your 30th birthday barbecue being rated by SWAT.
[02:01:45.939 --> 02:01:46.700]  What can you say?
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:47.682]  It must be a good thing.
[02:01:47.682 --> 02:01:53.390]  I mean, you know, most people don't have any clue as to what's going on.
[02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:54.532]  They have no idea.
[02:01:54.532 --> 02:02:00.200]  Most of these teenagers on Facebook, these young people, they're just out fooling around, having a good old time, clowning around with their friends.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:02.303]  And Big Brother's sitting there watching them and don't even know it.
[02:02:02.443 --> 02:02:06.927]  They don't even know, and you know, I want to take this opportunity now to also bring up our other Bob.
[02:02:06.927 --> 02:02:16.194]  Bob Chapman is our guest for this entire hour, and then in the last hour we're actually going to play this Eugenics rant of Alex Jones for an entire hour.
[02:02:16.194 --> 02:02:18.036]  How are you, Bob?
[02:02:18.036 --> 02:02:18.957]  I'm fine, thank you.
[02:02:18.957 --> 02:02:30.146]  It's interesting, I'm running into more and more stuff on eugenics, and Sotomayor referred to that in Roe vs Wade.
[02:02:30.979 --> 02:02:37.425]  People didn't realize what she was saying, but she's spoken before about eugenics, which we'll get into later.
[02:02:38.086 --> 02:03:00.900]  Well, absolutely, and one of the highlight clips that we're going to have to play again in this hour because it's just so important is Representative Joseph Pitts out of Pennsylvania on the House floor discussing Judge Ginsburg and her comments on pro-eugenics and population sustainability and control and their desire to root out, you know, undesirables.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:01.320]  That's right.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.761]  That's what it is, Mr. Dacey.
[02:03:02.761 --> 02:03:03.722]  It's undesirables.
[02:03:03.722 --> 02:03:04.422]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:03:04.422 --> 02:03:06.904]  All you have to do is go back to Germany.
[02:03:07.464 --> 02:03:14.148]  It is a very, very important word in the German language and it's called Untermenschen.
[02:03:14.148 --> 02:03:20.311]  And this is what they called, the Nazis called, subhumans is what it is in English.
[02:03:20.311 --> 02:03:24.473]  And this was part of only allowing
[02:03:25.117 --> 02:03:37.141]  The quote, intellectual and physical, and of course in the case of Germany, the purity of race to procreate.
[02:03:37.141 --> 02:03:46.064]  And this is what these people are talking about today, and even talking in America about it for a couple hundred years and most people don't know it.
[02:03:46.064 --> 02:03:48.145]  I have one of the biggest libraries in eugenics.
[02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:56.158]  Anywhere, which I ended up giving away to USC and UCLA because nobody ever wanted to read them besides me.
[02:03:56.158 --> 02:03:59.843]  And so this is where they're headed in America.
[02:03:59.843 --> 02:04:02.186]  This is how they're going to cull the population.
[02:04:03.174 --> 02:04:14.118]  They're going to use selective breeding, and people are going to be told you can't breed, and if you try to, you'll be aborted and sterilized.
[02:04:14.118 --> 02:04:22.780]  Well, I'm not sure if you've read this information, but the current health bill that's been passed is actually going to give, and it's only gone through the House, like I said.
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:24.561]  It hasn't been passed by the Senate, the health bill?
[02:04:27.048 --> 02:04:28.749]  I'm pretty sure it's just through the house.
[02:04:28.749 --> 02:04:36.691]  But the bill specifically says that they are providing funding for home visits that promote immunization through education.
[02:04:36.691 --> 02:04:43.853]  So in other words, they can enforce immunizations that you don't want to take by knocking on your door and saying you must take it.
[02:04:43.853 --> 02:04:45.353]  More on that on the other side.
[02:04:45.353 --> 02:04:48.894]  We're joined by Bob Dacey in studio and Bob Chapman over the phone.
[02:04:48.894 --> 02:04:49.895]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:49.895 --> 02:04:51.275]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:04:51.275 --> 02:04:53.236]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:01.049 --> 02:05:02.730]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:07.473]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:05:07.473 --> 02:05:10.435]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:05:10.435 --> 02:05:13.476]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:05:13.476 --> 02:05:19.320]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.802]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:22.802 --> 02:05:29.786]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:05:29.786 --> 02:05:33.068]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:05:49.782 --> 02:05:50.222]  Take action today.
[02:05:50.222 --> 02:05:52.024]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:06:00.728 --> 02:06:06.591]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[02:06:06.591 --> 02:06:07.891]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:06:07.891 --> 02:06:12.173]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:06:12.173 --> 02:06:14.034]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:06:14.034 --> 02:06:20.337]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:06:21.477 --> 02:06:24.338]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:06:24.338 --> 02:06:26.079]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:06:26.079 --> 02:06:29.079]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:06:29.079 --> 02:06:30.800]  And their formula really works.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:33.621]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:06:33.621 --> 02:06:35.101]  Try the NutriCafe.
[02:06:35.101 --> 02:06:39.883]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[02:06:39.883 --> 02:06:42.284]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:06:42.284 --> 02:06:44.745]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:06:44.745 --> 02:06:46.845]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:06:46.845 --> 02:06:48.426]  Go to www.
[02:06:49.446 --> 02:06:52.529]  E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.
[02:06:52.529 --> 02:06:57.192]  That's W-W-W dot E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.

[02:07:00.635 --> 02:07:04.879]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:07:04.879 --> 02:07:06.880]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:15.127]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:07:15.387 --> 02:07:20.929]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:07:20.929 --> 02:07:22.810]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:07:22.810 --> 02:07:29.312]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:07:29.312 --> 02:07:40.376]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:07:40.376 --> 02:07:41.737]  That's right, clean water.

[02:08:01.187 --> 02:08:06.570]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.570 --> 02:08:08.871]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:12.613]  And we are back, joined by Bob Dacey and Bob Chapman.
[02:08:12.613 --> 02:08:14.996]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.996 --> 02:08:16.337]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:16.337 --> 02:08:18.279]  And we're talking a little eugenics.
[02:08:18.279 --> 02:08:27.669]  And again, in the health care bill, they're saying that federally, they will fund, you know, state teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:29.131]  And here's just a little subsection.
[02:08:29.131 --> 02:08:31.714]  The program authorizing home interventions
[02:08:32.014 --> 02:08:36.377]  To promote immunization falls under subtitle C, creating healthier communities.
[02:08:36.377 --> 02:08:39.959]  So again, they're going to try to pressure you through your neighbors.
[02:08:39.959 --> 02:09:00.173]  This subtitle directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration program to award grants to states to improve the provision of recommended immunizations for children, adolescents and adults through the use of evidence-based, population-based interventions for quote-unquote high-risk populations.
[02:09:00.173 --> 02:09:01.694]  Mr. Chapman, what does that sound like to you?
[02:09:03.334 --> 02:09:09.036]  It sounds like you've got a police state and they're going to tell you what to do whether you like it or not.
[02:09:09.036 --> 02:09:17.779]  Exactly, and with all this hype surrounding the swine flu and Obama's science czar openly writing about this stuff, how do you feel about it, Mr. Dasey?
[02:09:17.779 --> 02:09:19.179]  Well, I think it's really neat.
[02:09:19.179 --> 02:09:23.801]  I mean, this John Holdren guy wrote this book back in the early 70s.
[02:09:25.001 --> 02:09:27.965]  And it perfectly dovetails with what we're talking about here.
[02:09:27.965 --> 02:09:43.701]  He says on page 786 through 787, the development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control.
[02:09:43.701 --> 02:09:46.785]  The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable
[02:09:47.472 --> 02:09:51.455]  With official permission for a limited number of births.
[02:09:51.455 --> 02:09:52.316]  It's right there.
[02:09:52.316 --> 02:09:52.876]  It's all perfect.
[02:09:52.876 --> 02:09:56.379]  Well, let's go back to that term, coercive fertility control.
[02:09:56.379 --> 02:10:06.007]  See, in this memo that they had to put out yesterday as this stuff is starting to surface, they're saying that Obama's science does not support coercive population control.
[02:10:06.007 --> 02:10:06.847]  What is that?
[02:10:06.847 --> 02:10:07.508]  I'm confused.
[02:10:07.508 --> 02:10:09.549]  Yeah, it sounds like semantics to me.
[02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:13.232]  Coercive fertility control, but not coercive population.
[02:10:13.232 --> 02:10:13.833]  Oh, I get it.
[02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:15.654]  I think that they're synonyms, aren't they?
[02:10:15.654 --> 02:10:17.134]  I don't get it.
[02:10:17.134 --> 02:10:17.895]  I don't get it.
[02:10:17.895 --> 02:10:26.458]  Well, it's the manipulation of the language, and these guys are masters of manipulating the language, and they do so on so many levels, Mr. Chapman.
[02:10:27.779 --> 02:10:29.440]  They certainly do.
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:41.230]  And it's amazing that people are able to go in and pull out these juicy little tidbits like you just read about what they're really all about, where they're headed with this thing.
[02:10:41.230 --> 02:10:49.516]  And, you know, I've been talking about this since the mid-1960s and regional government and things like that, and people thought we were crazy.
[02:10:49.516 --> 02:10:51.818]  And, you know, here it is now.
[02:10:51.818 --> 02:10:53.199]  It's happening.
[02:10:53.199 --> 02:10:56.762]  And it's absolutely downright frightening.
[02:10:57.766 --> 02:10:59.007]  I absolutely agree.
[02:10:59.007 --> 02:11:02.510]  I kind of want to jump topics here and get into the economy.
[02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:04.692]  I got a couple stories in front of me.
[02:11:04.692 --> 02:11:05.013]  U.S.
[02:11:05.013 --> 02:11:08.035]  video game sales post largest decline since 2000.
[02:11:08.035 --> 02:11:19.866]  One of the only really unbeatable industries, the ones that you've seen grow and grow and grow despite economic times, have been these big blockbuster video games that are now grossing more than major motion pictures.
[02:11:20.186 --> 02:11:26.508]  And now, since the first time since 2000, almost a decade ago, they're seeing their largest decline.
[02:11:26.508 --> 02:11:28.228]  Can't be good news for this economy.
[02:11:28.228 --> 02:11:31.129]  Even GE is saying that their revenue is down.
[02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:39.451]  And we're talking about one of the biggest media, military, industrial complex companies out there in the world.
[02:11:39.451 --> 02:11:40.511]  That's correct.
[02:11:40.511 --> 02:11:42.892]  And we are in depression.
[02:11:42.892 --> 02:11:45.392]  We started this past February.
[02:11:45.392 --> 02:11:48.193]  And it's an inflationary environment.
[02:11:49.003 --> 02:11:56.951]  And that inflationary environment will get worse over the next couple of years, and then we'll go into a deflationary environment.
[02:11:56.951 --> 02:12:04.497]  I think what's interesting here is that this is the epitome of Keynesianism, which is a school of economics.
[02:12:04.497 --> 02:12:11.704]  The antithesis to that is classical economics, and it looks like the European Central Bank, which represents 16 of about 29 nations in Europe,
[02:12:14.475 --> 02:12:26.145]  And they are taking the classical tact, which is to, yes, take interest rates down, but reduce the amount of money and credit being injected in the system.
[02:12:26.145 --> 02:12:30.448]  And just to show you the difference, the interest rates are all down.
[02:12:30.448 --> 02:12:37.414]  But on the other hand, the money supply in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other nations is up about 18%.
[02:12:39.532 --> 02:12:49.663]  And in the Eurozone, it's only up 3.7%, and that's down from a plus 12.8 about a year and a half ago.
[02:12:49.663 --> 02:12:52.246]  So they are taking the other tact in Europe.
[02:12:55.422 --> 02:13:14.096]  Well, what do you think is going to happen in the next few months in light of the last G8 summit, in light of this BRIC conference, in light of Russia's Medved, getting out there and showing people the prototype, and a minted prototype, might I add, for a global currency coin?
[02:13:14.096 --> 02:13:19.180]  Well, it's something that was bound to come.
[02:13:20.283 --> 02:13:27.347]  And I think what they're really looking for here is an international trading unit at first.
[02:13:27.347 --> 02:13:44.456]  I expect there's going to be another meeting similar to the Smithsonian-type meeting that was held in the early 70s in the Plaza Accords in 1985, and I think all the nations are going to get together within the next six months, and I think they're going to realign their currencies against one another.
[02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:52.768]  There'll be all these cross-currencies and they'll have these experts working at, you know, what's going to be devalued and what's going to be revalued.
[02:13:52.768 --> 02:13:59.113]  And I think that's going to happen, and I think it's going to be brought on by pressure on the United States dollar.
[02:13:59.113 --> 02:14:13.062]  The USDX is down from 89.5, it's trading around 79.5, and I expect it to test 71.18, and if it does that, between now and the end of October, we're going to have pressure on the dollar like we had
[02:14:13.783 --> 02:14:23.732]  About a year and a third ago, when other nations didn't want to accept the dollar, especially in trade and for people who are on vacation and things like that.
[02:14:23.732 --> 02:14:26.894]  If you remember, there were stories back then about that.
[02:14:26.894 --> 02:14:34.641]  And I think that's going to happen again, and I think it could cause a short bank holiday in the United States.
[02:14:35.307 --> 02:14:47.475]  Well, that would be something we haven't seen in so long, and it does seem to be going that way with, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, and China openly saying that they want a separate world reserve currency.
[02:14:47.475 --> 02:14:48.076]  Mr. Dacey?
[02:14:48.772 --> 02:14:50.953]  I don't want a separate world reserve currency.
[02:14:50.953 --> 02:14:58.255]  I would like to have our currency be strong so that they stop printing it like it's going out of style every five seconds and blowing away the value of it all the time.
[02:14:58.255 --> 02:15:03.036]  Of course, they've been doing it since, what, 1913?
[02:15:03.036 --> 02:15:05.917]  These people don't even know what classical economics is.
[02:15:05.917 --> 02:15:07.517]  I'm not an economics advisor.
[02:15:07.517 --> 02:15:10.698]  I don't really know that much about all that stuff, but I do know this.
[02:15:10.698 --> 02:15:13.759]  I was up in a conference back in 2006 up in Waco.
[02:15:13.759 --> 02:15:16.060]  It was a follow-up conference to that.
[02:15:18.781 --> 02:15:44.389]  I was up there for the New American and I was talking to these business people from Baylor University and these economics professors and the top guys at a little get-together that we had and I brought up, you know, the economic policies of Von Mises, is that how you pronounce his name?
[02:15:45.209 --> 02:15:46.789]  And they looked at me like I was crazy.
[02:15:46.789 --> 02:15:47.910]  They didn't know who he was!
[02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:50.090]  I mean, literally!
[02:15:50.090 --> 02:15:52.030]  They didn't know who he was!
[02:15:52.030 --> 02:15:53.090]  They didn't know what I was.
[02:15:53.090 --> 02:15:57.411]  The head of the economics department at Baylor University didn't know who the guy was.
[02:15:57.411 --> 02:15:58.831]  They don't understand it.
[02:15:58.831 --> 02:16:11.474]  No, most of them don't because they've been trained not to, and that's why it's so important for people listening to this program and aware of this information to really protect the wealth that they do have by investing in gold and silver and other precious metals.
[02:16:11.474 --> 02:16:13.534]  Why don't you tell people how they can do that, Mr. Chabon?
[02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:28.190]  Well, I think the best way to get into precious metals is to talk to Midas, and they have a big collection of gold and silver coins and bullion for you to purchase.
[02:16:29.799 --> 02:16:36.404]  And they also will supply you with a free introductory copy to the International Forecaster as well.
[02:16:36.404 --> 02:16:40.707]  All you have to do is call 877-479-8178.
[02:16:40.707 --> 02:16:44.130]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:16:44.130 --> 02:16:59.081]  I was on with Ted Anderson Thursday with Butch Parr, which was last night, and we talked about the availability and the things that were going on in the gold and silver markets.
[02:17:00.018 --> 02:17:09.769]  And there was one more thing I was going to bring to fore in the conversation regarding the descent of the dollar.
[02:17:09.769 --> 02:17:20.341]  And that is, I have been told by extraordinarily reliable sources, actually a half dozen of them, that, and I released this information two months ago when nobody else did,
[02:17:21.242 --> 02:17:23.003]  And the U.S.
[02:17:23.003 --> 02:17:25.783]  embassies have been getting U.S.
[02:17:25.783 --> 02:17:30.304]  dollars, which they are supposed to turn into local currencies.
[02:17:30.304 --> 02:17:36.766]  And I don't know in total how many embassies have received it, but I know at least six of them have.
[02:17:36.766 --> 02:17:42.807]  And I just had another writer send me an email this morning, and he said, I can verify what you're saying.
[02:17:42.807 --> 02:17:46.048]  So, the government is getting ready for a problem.
[02:17:47.087 --> 02:17:55.360]  Well, if they do dispense these local currencies, and let's say that they do actually have a bank holiday, what is it going to look like in this country?
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:59.166]  Well, your ATM credit and debit cards won't work.
[02:17:59.166 --> 02:18:00.448]  Nobody will accept checks.
[02:18:01.374 --> 02:18:03.515]  Until the banks, you know, reopen.
[02:18:03.515 --> 02:18:06.395]  I don't think they're going to be shut down a long time.
[02:18:06.395 --> 02:18:09.816]  I think it will be perhaps four or five days.
[02:18:09.816 --> 02:18:27.061]  And I think it's going to be a trial run, a precursor to what they think is going to happen down the line when they have to shut them all for a longer extended period of time, perhaps, when they're going to do these multi-country, multi-currency devaluations.
[02:18:27.881 --> 02:18:29.983]  So maybe you think it's going to be a beta test?
[02:18:29.983 --> 02:18:35.027]  A beta test to see how the populace will react to not being able to get their money for a week?
[02:18:35.027 --> 02:18:35.948]  Yes.
[02:18:35.948 --> 02:18:38.990]  But if they do that, what's going to happen when they reopen?
[02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:40.932]  Isn't that going to cause a bank run?
[02:18:40.932 --> 02:18:43.034]  Aren't people going to freak out?
[02:18:43.034 --> 02:18:49.859]  No, I think that people are going to be so happy that the banks are back open, they're not going to do too much.
[02:18:49.859 --> 02:18:55.844]  It's the behavior that they're looking for in between the time the banks are shut down and they reopen again.
[02:18:56.946 --> 02:19:12.298]  So what you're saying is they want to gauge how much outrage there'll be, how much public outcry there'll be, but they also want to see whether or not they can convince those people who have that kind of an outcry not to take all their money out of banks and basically convince them that everything's going to be okay.
[02:19:12.298 --> 02:19:14.620]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:23.867]  I think that you probably have the title to this, but this coming week we have maneuvers in the United States with Australian
[02:19:24.568 --> 02:19:27.135]  German, Mexican, Canadian, and U.S.
[02:19:27.135 --> 02:19:28.017]  troops.
[02:19:28.017 --> 02:19:28.578]  And U.K.
[02:19:28.578 --> 02:19:29.220]  troops.
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:30.443]  And private forces, by the way.
[02:19:32.773 --> 02:19:34.054]  But I know exactly what you're talking about.
[02:19:34.054 --> 02:19:37.276]  If you don't know what it is, it's National Level Exercise 09.
[02:19:37.276 --> 02:19:39.938]  It's going to be held in the last week of July.
[02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:43.481]  It's going to be starting, actually, the day after I get back from California.
[02:19:43.481 --> 02:19:45.342]  Totally and completely nightmarish.
[02:19:45.342 --> 02:19:52.167]  A total surveillance state is what they're practicing for, taking over all local governments, state governments, tribal governments, and much more.
[02:19:52.167 --> 02:19:55.649]  We're going to talk NLE 09 on the other side with Bob Dacey and Bob Chabon.
[02:19:55.649 --> 02:19:56.910]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:56.910 --> 02:19:58.572]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:22:01.178 --> 02:22:05.641]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[02:22:05.641 --> 02:22:09.364]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[02:22:09.364 --> 02:22:12.266]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[02:22:12.266 --> 02:22:18.831]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[02:22:18.831 --> 02:22:21.193]  The only real option is precious metals.
[02:22:21.193 --> 02:22:26.878]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[02:22:27.844 --> 02:22:30.965]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[02:22:30.965 --> 02:22:35.486]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[02:22:35.486 --> 02:22:40.987]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:22:40.987 --> 02:22:45.528]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:22:45.528 --> 02:22:49.429]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:54.110]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:56.811]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[02:23:00.726 --> 02:23:06.532]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:23:06.532 --> 02:23:14.120]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:20.286]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:23:20.706 --> 02:23:22.668]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:23:22.668 --> 02:23:25.170]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:23:25.170 --> 02:23:36.739]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:23:36.739 --> 02:23:38.421]  It's not about left or right.
[02:23:38.421 --> 02:23:40.282]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:23:40.282 --> 02:23:44.646]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[02:23:45.291 --> 02:23:47.173]  And his real agenda.
[02:23:47.173 --> 02:23:55.440]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:57.022]  The Obama Deception.
[02:23:57.022 --> 02:23:58.203]  The people strike back.
[02:24:22.054 --> 02:24:23.996]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:23.996 --> 02:24:25.377]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:24:25.377 --> 02:24:29.180]  Joining me in studio is Bob Dacey and over the phone is Bob Chapman.
[02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:32.422]  We're going to take your calls in the next segment.
[02:24:32.422 --> 02:24:44.532]  But I also want to remind people that we are documentary filmmakers out here and our recent picture, Reflections and Warnings, an interview with Aaron Russo, is now available for free, folks!
[02:24:44.532 --> 02:24:48.095]  For free when you get yourself a copy of Endgame and some of the other great movies.
[02:24:48.795 --> 02:25:01.841]  Over at the Infowars gift shop and I want to remind people my film, Fabled Enemies, if you want to know about the international intelligence agency that actually did carry out 9-11, we cover it from front to back in this video.
[02:25:01.841 --> 02:25:09.205]  Barry Jennings, the current Vice President of the United States, Joseph Biden, Cynthia McKinney, Michael J. Springman, Bo Dietl, and so much more.
[02:25:09.205 --> 02:25:10.265]  Fabled Enemies.
[02:25:10.265 --> 02:25:11.246]  Go check it out.
[02:25:12.139 --> 02:25:19.242]  Now, we were talking about this state of the economy, we were talking about bank holidays and local currencies.
[02:25:19.242 --> 02:25:27.785]  Mr. Chapman, if the government starts issuing local currencies, what is the economy in this country going to look like and what are we going to be doing day-to-day?
[02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:29.086]  I mean, how is that going to work?
[02:25:30.598 --> 02:25:40.846]  Well, as I said, I think they'll have a large meeting, so to speak, and they'll decide ahead of time how much one currency is going to be devalued against another.
[02:25:40.846 --> 02:25:47.791]  And, of course, all of those changes are going to make all of those currencies degenerate in value versus gold.
[02:25:47.791 --> 02:25:49.812]  And so that's very important.
[02:25:49.812 --> 02:25:58.739]  But I think if they were to do a switch like that now, now there's a thing called the USDX, and it's six currencies, major currencies,
[02:25:59.674 --> 02:26:04.318]  Weighted each one against the dollar.
[02:26:04.318 --> 02:26:23.092]  Now, the USDX is probably at the state that it's in now, you would probably see somewhere between a 50% and 70% reduction of the dollar versus that group of currencies, that six currencies.
[02:26:23.092 --> 02:26:26.515]  And that's one heck of a devaluation.
[02:26:27.028 --> 02:26:40.258]  But what would have to happen at the same time, there would have to be an adjustment of debt between countries, because 64.5% of all of the foreign exchange held by other countries is in dollars.
[02:26:40.258 --> 02:26:46.022]  So everybody's going to take a haircut if they do that, and I think that's coming.
[02:26:46.022 --> 02:26:48.404]  Well that is just, it's nightmarish.
[02:26:48.404 --> 02:26:54.729]  I wonder what happens to other localized currencies that are outside of government control, like say the Lakota rounds.
[02:26:56.488 --> 02:26:57.769]  Well, they'd go up in value.
[02:26:57.769 --> 02:27:00.250]  Silver and gold will go up in value.
[02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:08.075]  If the value of the dollar, let's say, went down 50%, then we would assume that gold and silver would rise 50%.
[02:27:08.075 --> 02:27:09.596]  But doesn't that put them in kind of a spot?
[02:27:09.596 --> 02:27:10.857]  Maybe even a lot more.
[02:27:10.857 --> 02:27:22.403]  But I understand that the rounds essentially would be worth more, but actually in those communities where they're using the rounds as currency, don't you think the federal government is going to want to step in and further regulate them?
[02:27:22.403 --> 02:27:23.284]  I mean, when you look at this,
[02:27:23.744 --> 02:27:24.564]  We're good to go.
[02:27:51.175 --> 02:27:56.699]  Australia, the UK, and then private organizations also taking part.
[02:27:56.699 --> 02:27:57.720]  Well, that's correct.
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:05.746]  And, you know, we're just going to have to watch what they do, because we don't know exactly what they are going to do.
[02:28:05.746 --> 02:28:09.229]  We have to learn as much from what they're doing as they do.
[02:28:09.229 --> 02:28:15.013]  And then we have to broadcast and let everybody know about it, because certainly mainline media is not going to carry it.
[02:28:15.402 --> 02:28:28.454]  That's right, and it's for a full week and people really do need to arm themselves with cameras and questions if we want to expose this to the world via InfoWars and YouTube, Mr. Dacey.
[02:28:28.454 --> 02:28:32.058]  I want to know from Bob, I have a question for him about this bank holiday thing.
[02:28:32.658 --> 02:28:35.579]  I mean, I'm a retailer, you know, I have a local hardware store.
[02:28:35.579 --> 02:28:37.580]  How does that affect the guy on the street?
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:46.142]  I'm in the real world, you know, mainstream America, real business, you know, people getting their toilets fixed and getting their light bulbs changed and all that.
[02:28:46.142 --> 02:28:50.724]  How does that affect the average retail establishment during a bank holiday?
[02:28:50.724 --> 02:28:51.784]  What happens?
[02:28:51.784 --> 02:28:53.365]  You don't take credit cards or what?
[02:28:53.365 --> 02:28:54.965]  How does that play out?
[02:28:54.965 --> 02:28:58.727]  Well, you can't because it won't function, and neither will ATMs.
[02:28:58.727 --> 02:28:59.927]  Well, then nothing will function!
[02:29:01.078 --> 02:29:01.819]  Well, that's true.
[02:29:01.819 --> 02:29:04.442]  I mean, that's what everybody uses, isn't it?
[02:29:14.474 --> 02:29:17.896]  And of course, government will say, well, we'll have this fixed in a few days, so don't worry about it.
[02:29:17.896 --> 02:29:27.200]  But wait a minute, Bob, won't that also cause an artificial run on the banks if places start actually taking checks that are, say, postdated to when the banks reopen?
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:35.464]  Won't there be just an exorbitant amount of checks that are postdated for when this bank holiday ends, which could then, again, cripple these banks once more?
[02:29:35.464 --> 02:29:37.305]  I want to get your opinion on that.
[02:29:37.305 --> 02:29:40.627]  On the other side, we're going to be taking your calls, Tony, Rob, Matt, Darren.
[02:29:41.127 --> 02:29:41.628]  And more.
[02:29:41.628 --> 02:29:42.689]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:42.689 --> 02:29:44.290]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[02:29:44.290 --> 02:29:47.373]  I am with the Bobs, Bob Dacey and Bob Chapman.
[02:29:47.373 --> 02:29:51.717]  Go check out the latest news over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:51.717 --> 02:29:53.118]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.118 --> 02:29:54.739]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.739 --> 02:29:58.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.796 --> 02:30:02.178]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.178 --> 02:30:04.180]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:05.161]  Well, you should.
[02:30:05.161 --> 02:30:09.646]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:30:09.646 --> 02:30:10.467]  That's right.
[02:30:10.467 --> 02:30:19.137]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:30:19.137 --> 02:30:20.478]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:21.620]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:27.803]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:30:27.803 --> 02:30:34.687]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:30:34.687 --> 02:30:40.210]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:30:40.210 --> 02:30:41.691]  This is real.
[02:30:41.691 --> 02:30:42.731]  Don't miss out.
[02:30:42.731 --> 02:30:49.595]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:30:49.835 --> 02:30:51.278]  And get your free handgun.
[02:30:51.278 --> 02:30:53.642]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:30:53.642 --> 02:30:57.348]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:30:57.348 --> 02:31:00.273]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:31:01.141 --> 02:31:06.345]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:06.345 --> 02:31:10.368]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.368 --> 02:31:16.272]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.272 --> 02:31:21.335]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.335 --> 02:31:27.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:30.862]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here
[02:31:30.862 --> 02:31:31.162]  We're good.
[02:32:01.172 --> 02:32:02.833]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.833 --> 02:32:07.574]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:32:07.574 --> 02:32:10.556]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:32:10.556 --> 02:32:13.597]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:32:13.597 --> 02:32:19.439]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:32:19.659 --> 02:32:22.902]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:32:22.902 --> 02:32:29.887]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:32:29.887 --> 02:32:33.170]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:35.051]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[02:32:38.314 --> 02:32:44.577]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:32:44.577 --> 02:32:48.340]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:49.700]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:50.321]  Take action today.
[02:32:50.321 --> 02:32:52.182]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:32:52.182 --> 02:32:53.282]  Man thinks cause he rules the earth.
[02:33:06.058 --> 02:33:33.841]  He can do it as he please And if things don't change soon He will Oh, man has invented his doom First step was touching the moon Now there's a woman on my block She'll just sit there as the night grows still She'll say, who?
[02:33:36.423 --> 02:33:37.403]  Alright folks, we are back.
[02:33:37.403 --> 02:33:38.284]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:38.284 --> 02:33:39.564]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[02:33:39.564 --> 02:33:42.245]  I'm going to be with you on Sunday as well.
[02:33:42.245 --> 02:33:47.947]  We're about to, in the next 30 minutes, we're going to play a eugenics rant by Alex Jones.
[02:33:47.947 --> 02:33:49.988]  Hopefully he is going to call in before the end of the show.
[02:33:49.988 --> 02:33:55.890]  But we just posed the question to Mr. Dacey, if they do have these bank run- or not Mr. Dacey, I'm sorry, Mr. Chapman.
[02:33:55.890 --> 02:33:58.111]  The Bob and Bob thing is killing me right now.
[02:33:58.111 --> 02:34:04.773]  But Mr. Chapman, if they do have this bank holiday, and people do start accepting checks that are post-dated, which
[02:34:05.493 --> 02:34:15.343]  Maybe the only way to really have transactions, like you said, because there's not going to be a lot of cash available, people won't be able to use their credit cards, they can't use their ATM cards, they're going to be totally completely shut down.
[02:34:15.343 --> 02:34:26.014]  Won't that cause an artificial bank run, whether or not there's an actual bank run with people taking all their money out, an artificial bank run, on the day that they reopen because everybody's going to be cashing these checks?
[02:34:27.893 --> 02:34:31.836]  No, I don't think it'll be that terse.
[02:34:31.836 --> 02:34:39.301]  They have the ability to process them, and even if they were backed up for two or three days, it's no biggie.
[02:34:39.301 --> 02:34:43.725]  It's just that many accounts wouldn't get credited as quickly as people would like.
[02:34:43.725 --> 02:34:45.626]  But they'll sort that out.
[02:34:45.626 --> 02:34:47.948]  I don't think that's going to be a big thing.
[02:34:47.948 --> 02:34:54.653]  The important thing is that people are going to learn that these kind of things can happen again, like they happened in the 1930s.
[02:34:54.653 --> 02:34:55.153]  And secondly,
[02:34:56.673 --> 02:35:02.934]  They're going to rediscover how important gold and silver is a medium of exchange.
[02:35:02.934 --> 02:35:10.516]  And I think that that will come into play, especially silver and small coins like the Sovereign and so on.
[02:35:10.516 --> 02:35:21.378]  And it's just, again, I think, a trial run to build up to something bigger that they get in mind later on.
[02:35:22.594 --> 02:35:23.395]  What do you think?
[02:35:23.395 --> 02:35:26.357]  I want to know what that something bigger that they got in mind later on is.
[02:35:26.357 --> 02:35:29.379]  I think it might be that coin that Medvedev is holding over there.
[02:35:29.379 --> 02:35:34.822]  I mean, that coin just creeps me out that they've actually minted a global currency coin.
[02:35:34.822 --> 02:35:36.903]  Remember, it's in its beta test stage.
[02:35:36.903 --> 02:35:39.885]  But just that they have it there and they're like, this is what we want.
[02:35:39.885 --> 02:35:41.106]  And they're holding these meetings.
[02:35:41.106 --> 02:35:48.150]  Again, this BRIC meeting, this Brazil, Russia, India and China meeting, they're openly saying, we don't like the dollar.
[02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:49.331]  We want to kick it in the back.
[02:35:49.591 --> 02:35:51.152]  Well, actually they want to cut its throat.
[02:35:51.152 --> 02:35:54.974]  It's already like, you know, crippled on its knees and like chained up.
[02:35:54.974 --> 02:35:57.335]  They just want to cut the throat of it and just bleed it out.
[02:35:57.335 --> 02:36:11.082]  Well, I just think just as a retailer who day-to-day just rings up hundreds of sales all the time, that's what I do, it would just paralyze the whole country if they had a bank holiday.
[02:36:11.082 --> 02:36:12.843]  People get mad if I open five minutes late.
[02:36:13.263 --> 02:36:14.183]  Yeah, but you know what?
[02:36:14.183 --> 02:36:15.063]  They do some things.
[02:36:15.063 --> 02:36:16.664]  They probably pull stunts.
[02:36:16.664 --> 02:36:18.144]  Not only in the media, but in sports.
[02:36:18.144 --> 02:36:23.345]  They'd be like, free day to come on down to the stadium and see the Texas Rangers play.
[02:36:23.345 --> 02:36:24.786]  It's a bank holiday.
[02:36:24.786 --> 02:36:27.326]  First, you know, 20,000 that show up.
[02:36:27.326 --> 02:36:29.707]  They'd be, you know, motivating people.
[02:36:29.707 --> 02:36:31.727]  Shutting down what's left of the real economy.
[02:36:31.727 --> 02:36:33.948]  Hey man, the social engineers are smart.
[02:36:33.948 --> 02:36:34.728]  That's all I know.
[02:36:34.728 --> 02:36:38.068]  Alright, let's take some calls for Bob Dasey and Bob Chapman.
[02:36:38.068 --> 02:36:39.729]  Let's go to Tony in Texas.
[02:36:39.729 --> 02:36:40.309]  Tony, you're on the line.
[02:36:42.239 --> 02:36:43.439]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:43.439 --> 02:36:47.781]  Hey, look, I just like the format with the Jason, Bob, and Bob Show.
[02:36:47.781 --> 02:36:50.461]  Hey, real quick, Bob, where's your store?
[02:36:50.461 --> 02:36:54.602]  And I want to give you a chance to give you a quick plug for yourself, because we're... Well, you know, it's a local.
[02:36:54.602 --> 02:36:59.164]  It's in Northwest Austin at Highway 183 and Spotswood Springs Road.
[02:36:59.164 --> 02:37:05.845]  And, you know, we're just... Hey, I live in Austin, so I'm looking for a good hardware store, because I ain't going to Home Depot and that other place.
[02:37:05.845 --> 02:37:07.806]  Well, you think I paid this guy to call in, right?
[02:37:08.146 --> 02:37:08.646]  I did not.
[02:37:08.646 --> 02:37:10.807]  This is a hard solicited caller.
[02:37:10.807 --> 02:37:12.627]  Alright, this is the hardware store.
[02:37:12.627 --> 02:37:14.928]  We're the true value hardware store in Austin.
[02:37:14.928 --> 02:37:17.469]  It's the Hardware Store Incorporated, true value.
[02:37:17.469 --> 02:37:22.470]  And yes, we do e-foods, and yes we make screens, and yes we sell the evil guns.
[02:37:22.470 --> 02:37:23.970]  And apparently you fix toilets.
[02:37:23.970 --> 02:37:24.951]  And we fix toilets.
[02:37:24.951 --> 02:37:26.391]  Well, we don't fix them.
[02:37:26.391 --> 02:37:28.131]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:37:28.131 --> 02:37:29.412]  We tell you how to fix them.
[02:37:29.412 --> 02:37:30.452]  Oh, I gotcha.
[02:37:30.452 --> 02:37:34.613]  And no, we don't rent toilet augers either, because we don't want the darn things back.
[02:37:34.613 --> 02:37:36.134]  We sell them, you know.
[02:37:36.134 --> 02:37:37.294]  What else you got for us, Tony?
[02:37:38.352 --> 02:37:44.216]  First off, I really called to talk about Heidi and Spencer and torture, but I just wanted to say something real fast.
[02:37:44.216 --> 02:37:49.240]  John Maynard Keynes is well known to have been something of a sexual deviant.
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:52.382]  He kept sex diaries, one of which is encoded.
[02:37:52.382 --> 02:38:03.730]  He liked to photograph young boys, and I think the whole idea of stealing from the future of someone else for your own perverse gratification kind of carries through into his economics.
[02:38:03.730 --> 02:38:06.432]  However, having said that, you know, I saw that
[02:38:07.150 --> 02:38:20.499]  Heidi and Spencer were claiming torture, and so the whole time that I was hearing this, I was thinking it was over something I actually saw on that show in which they literally waterboarded the contestants.
[02:38:20.499 --> 02:38:23.141]  Oh, was that from Celebrity Get Me Out of Here?
[02:38:23.141 --> 02:38:23.721]  Yes.
[02:38:23.721 --> 02:38:33.068]  One of the challenges, they had an octagon with the little teeter boards attached to the side of like an octagonal baby pool filled with spiders and snakes.
[02:38:33.547 --> 02:38:48.971]  They had people on an incline board with their head lower than their chest, they had them in goggles and a protective jumpsuit, and snakes and spiders crawling all over them, and John Sally's there, you know, trash-talking people, go ahead, quit, you don't want to quit.
[02:38:48.971 --> 02:38:52.891]  And I'm like, well, this is the usual spiders and snakes reality show garbage.
[02:38:52.891 --> 02:38:57.513]  But then, the pool starts filling up with water.
[02:38:57.513 --> 02:38:59.433]  And it gets all the way up to their nose.
[02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:03.712]  And once it got up to the nose, nobody lasted longer than two or three seconds.
[02:39:03.712 --> 02:39:06.980]  Spongia from American Idol won.
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:08.604]  Oh, he didn't get one?
[02:39:11.605 --> 02:39:20.848]  Alex Jones would tell you that this is just the standard dehumanization of a culture.
[02:39:20.848 --> 02:39:23.128]  It's getting you desensitized to this sort of thing.
[02:39:23.128 --> 02:39:26.489]  He wasn't a big fan, even though he's had Joe Rogan on the program and they're friends.
[02:39:26.489 --> 02:39:32.350]  He wasn't a big fan of some of the things they did on there, especially when they were taking metal spikes and throwing them through there.
[02:39:32.350 --> 02:39:36.411]  And this waterboarding debate has really just gotten out of control.
[02:39:36.411 --> 02:39:37.312]  I thank you for the call.
[02:39:37.312 --> 02:39:38.532]  It is quite obvious
[02:39:38.792 --> 02:39:40.394]  That this is torture, Mr. Dayson.
[02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:58.849]  That was a Dennis the Menace guy.
[02:39:58.849 --> 02:40:01.070]  Maybe a little Mork and Mindy.
[02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:02.350]  Monsters.
[02:40:02.350 --> 02:40:05.731]  Whatever happened to Andy of Mayberry.
[02:40:05.731 --> 02:40:08.172]  Whatever happened to the decent shows.
[02:40:08.172 --> 02:40:11.953]  The vast majority of what's on TV now is total garbage.
[02:40:11.953 --> 02:40:20.776]  What's your take on pop culture and what's on the television and shows like this where they are dehumanizing people to desensitize them to things like torture and waterboarding?
[02:40:20.776 --> 02:40:23.677]  They're trying to turn us into what they think we are.
[02:40:24.767 --> 02:40:25.449]  Hey, how are you doing?
[02:40:35.286 --> 02:40:41.751]  Um, basically I heard a caller earlier calling about, uh, thinking about the military gearing up for something.
[02:40:41.751 --> 02:40:49.416]  Um, I have prior service, uh, in the past and was, uh, discharged for not being MLS qualified within 24 months, federal law.
[02:40:49.416 --> 02:40:50.077]  Okay.
[02:40:50.077 --> 02:40:55.741]  And basically I received the email, uh, within the week and it basically said, you know, you can join back in.
[02:40:55.741 --> 02:40:56.842]  You don't have to go to MAPS.
[02:40:56.842 --> 02:40:57.942]  You don't have to do nothing.
[02:40:57.942 --> 02:41:01.005]  You can go right in, pick a job and go to your schooling.
[02:41:02.797 --> 02:41:06.660]  Well, they're desperate to recruit as many people as possible into the military.
[02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:15.146]  You know, we just had that caller earlier saying that people who were accused of small and petty crimes, and I thank you for the call, they were making sure that they'd signed in for selective service.
[02:41:15.146 --> 02:41:24.234]  We also know people, they'll try to send you to shock camp or say, hey, join the military after you've done something stupid like use drugs or sold drugs to others.
[02:41:24.854 --> 02:41:35.342]  And they're having a tough time selling this military to people because we're still in Afghanistan, we're still in Iraq, and we're still beating the war's drum against Iran.
[02:41:35.342 --> 02:41:37.644]  Speaking of that, Jason, I just have to say this.
[02:41:37.644 --> 02:41:40.526]  I had a fellow young man in my store yesterday.
[02:41:40.526 --> 02:41:42.768]  He had just joined the Marine Corps.
[02:41:42.768 --> 02:41:43.588]  Nice guy.
[02:41:43.588 --> 02:41:44.849]  Really nice guy.
[02:41:44.849 --> 02:41:48.292]  And he was all proud and he was a private first class in the Marine Corps.
[02:41:50.153 --> 02:42:08.395]  We were talking and I just had to bring up this Obama thing about the the major whose orders to go to Afghanistan got revoked because he wanted to sue the president to make him prove that he's actually qualified to be president because he won't pony up his birth certificate and we got to talking about that and I was thinking
[02:42:09.475 --> 02:42:24.642]  I was kind of at two minds about talking to him about it, because what I told the young man is, you know, he listened, and he understood the constitutional problems involved in a commander-in-chief who's a fraud, possibly, or won't prove that he's qualified to be president.
[02:42:24.642 --> 02:42:28.704]  But I told him, I said, listen, son, you know, the Marine Corps is a great thing.
[02:42:28.704 --> 02:42:30.264]  You just do your job.
[02:42:30.264 --> 02:42:31.925]  You be a good Marine.
[02:42:31.925 --> 02:42:37.608]  This is way above your pay grade, so absorb it maybe, but just stay out of it, you know, because, you know,
[02:42:38.508 --> 02:42:45.150]  Marines are, you know, my dad was a Marine, my granddad was a Marine, my uncles were Marines, they're all Marines, you know?
[02:42:45.150 --> 02:42:50.332]  And it's a shame what they're doing.
[02:42:50.332 --> 02:42:55.494]  Yeah, no, how they manipulate military personnel.
[02:42:55.494 --> 02:43:05.297]  And, you know, they think they're out there to protect the United States and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and they're being manipulated into doing something which is the exact opposite.
[02:43:05.297 --> 02:43:06.798]  It's so sad on a personal level.
[02:43:07.864 --> 02:43:13.548]  You know, Bob Chapman, I want to get your take on what's happening in the Middle East and what your forecast is.
[02:43:13.548 --> 02:43:16.390]  We just had this big bombing in Indonesia.
[02:43:16.390 --> 02:43:20.052]  They're not saying who's responsible yet, but I haven't been watching the news wires.
[02:43:20.052 --> 02:43:23.735]  I'm sure they're going to blame Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda-like insurgents.
[02:43:23.735 --> 02:43:26.377]  Do you see an escalation in the activity there?
[02:43:26.377 --> 02:43:32.701]  Or do you think it's just going to kind of taper off into the background and we're going to just continue to conduct operations in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[02:43:34.522 --> 02:43:35.123]  Hard to say.
[02:43:35.123 --> 02:43:38.385]  And I think it probably would taper off.
[02:43:38.385 --> 02:43:51.436]  And the problem is not only the occupation of Iraq and the continual bombings, but also the service that we are in in Afghanistan, which I think
[02:43:52.217 --> 02:43:56.719]  Pakistan's a very, very good chance of going into Pakistan.
[02:43:56.719 --> 02:44:01.602]  And so I think... Well, we're already conducting operations in Pakistan.
[02:44:01.602 --> 02:44:02.923]  Let's talk about that for a minute.
[02:44:02.923 --> 02:44:13.708]  I mean, you can't now hit the news wires for less than two or three days without finding out that we used a drone attack to kill 40, 50, or 60 people, and it's always their insurgents.
[02:44:13.948 --> 02:44:15.289]  Let's be real about this.
[02:44:15.289 --> 02:44:17.270]  They're killing families.
[02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:18.591]  They're killing neighborhoods.
[02:44:18.591 --> 02:44:28.536]  When you're killing 40, 50, or 60 people at a time, it's not always an insurgency camp, or an al-Qaeda center, or a Taliban terrorist training facility.
[02:44:28.536 --> 02:44:32.238]  The majority of the times, they're targeting the regular populace.
[02:44:32.238 --> 02:44:37.181]  And we had this come out, I think, about a month ago, where they were paying, quote-unquote, another insurgent.
[02:44:37.481 --> 02:44:57.284]  To take little microchips, small little microchips the size of a grain of rice, and then throw them into quote-unquote other insurgents' homes, and then a missile would be guided in by that microchip, and the guy said, well, they were paying me $122 every time they'd give me a handful, so I was just putting them anywhere.
[02:44:57.284 --> 02:45:06.606]  And I believe that, and this is the kind of thing that government uses to extend warfare if they want to do so.
[02:45:07.410 --> 02:45:10.652]  And they are going to continue in Pakistan.
[02:45:10.652 --> 02:45:17.195]  Where else they'll go, Iran or North Korea or wherever, remains to be seen.
[02:45:17.195 --> 02:45:26.940]  But one thing you can be assured of is that in very, very troubled economic and financial times, history tells us that a war has always begun.
[02:45:28.763 --> 02:45:31.606]  A different, a bigger war than we already have.
[02:45:31.606 --> 02:45:33.769]  And so that's what I think we've got to look forward to.
[02:45:33.769 --> 02:45:41.377]  And incidentally, I have to mention something I mentioned with Ted last night on Butch Parr's program.
[02:45:41.377 --> 02:45:45.161]  And that is, I had on Drew Raine's blog talk show,
[02:45:45.786 --> 02:46:03.721]  I had a colonel who had just come back from Afghanistan and he said that they had four British Sovereigns sewn into their uniform and he had to bail out of his plane and when he hit the ground and
[02:46:04.702 --> 02:46:30.201]  Holden is parachute low and behold it was some locals there and he took out a Sovereign and handed to them and they took him to some camel herders Who when he met them he gave them a sovereign and they all smiled and took him to a village and in the village He gave him a sovereign and they took him to his unit and so the moral of the story is he who has the gold makes the rules and
[02:46:31.437 --> 02:46:38.463]  No, absolutely, and that is, again, a currency that transcends, you know, destinations, places, actual regions.
[02:46:38.463 --> 02:46:42.306]  I mean, gold and silver are not regional currencies.
[02:46:42.306 --> 02:46:43.948]  They are universal currencies.
[02:46:43.948 --> 02:46:50.093]  They have been used since the beginning of time and, well, civilized time anyway, and they've retained their value.
[02:46:50.093 --> 02:46:53.456]  How can people get gold and silver right now, Mr. Chabon?
[02:46:53.456 --> 02:46:54.497]  Well, they call it Midas.
[02:46:54.497 --> 02:46:55.578]  That's the best place to go.
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:47:01.082]  And they'll take care of you, you know, in a hop, skip, and a jump.
[02:47:01.082 --> 02:47:11.866]  And they'll also give you a free introductory copy of the International Forecaster, and either a hard copy or an email copy.
[02:47:11.866 --> 02:47:13.666]  And you can do that by calling in to 877-479-8178.
[02:47:13.666 --> 02:47:14.247]  That's toll-free, 877-479-8178.
[02:47:24.304 --> 02:47:25.766]  Alright, let's take some more callers.
[02:47:25.766 --> 02:47:27.687]  Let's go to Matt in the United Kingdom.
[02:47:27.687 --> 02:47:29.089]  Matt, you're online.
[02:47:29.089 --> 02:47:29.809]  How you doing, guys?
[02:47:29.809 --> 02:47:36.036]  I just want to mention, I'm a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, so you can give a wave here to the guys in the UK.
[02:47:36.036 --> 02:47:39.199]  Alright.
[02:47:39.199 --> 02:47:43.903]  My point is basically about the Facebook thing in the UK.
[02:47:43.903 --> 02:47:46.606]  Obviously, you've seen that in the Daily Mail article.
[02:47:47.342 --> 02:47:52.746]  Uh... now my question is basically, is Facebook safe anymore?
[02:47:52.746 --> 02:47:55.708]  Because obviously they found out that I was out creating this party.
[02:47:55.708 --> 02:48:00.912]  Well let me tell you this, two years ago I captured something that I'm going to be using in Invisible Empire.
[02:48:00.912 --> 02:48:06.336]  I've been wanting to do this New World Order picture for quite some time, really working on it, working on it hard, finalized the first third of my script.
[02:48:06.336 --> 02:48:10.419]  But two years ago I was watching G4TV, which is kind of like this
[02:48:11.179 --> 02:48:11.399]  I don't
[02:48:32.592 --> 02:48:41.858]  And then like I said two months ago, I saw that they busted a New Jersey post-prom party where kids were going to be drinking the evil alcohol after graduating from high school.
[02:48:41.858 --> 02:48:43.759]  How dare they have a right of passage?
[02:48:43.759 --> 02:48:46.901]  And their post-prom party was actually raided by the police.
[02:48:46.901 --> 02:48:48.382]  So is it safe?
[02:48:48.382 --> 02:48:49.883]  Nothing you do is safe on the internet.
[02:48:50.003 --> 02:49:05.056]  Just like I told you before, all the major telecommunication companies by federal law are forced to have a separate room where everything you do on your cell phone and everything you do on the internet is then tracked, traced, and database put into another hard drive system.
[02:49:05.056 --> 02:49:08.899]  It then runs through software, this again doesn't mean people are actually looking at you yet,
[02:49:09.139 --> 02:49:15.046]  But then you are profiled and through these profiles they set up actual human units and they start to surveil you.
[02:49:15.046 --> 02:49:22.015]  That's why you see these fusion dissenter documents in the United States where they say, oh yeah, we are targeting people who are anti-illegal immigration.
[02:49:22.015 --> 02:49:24.958]  Oh yeah, we are targeting people who are anti-technology.
[02:49:24.958 --> 02:49:27.862]  We are targeting people that are one, what is it?
[02:49:29.385 --> 02:49:30.026]  One agenda?
[02:49:30.026 --> 02:49:32.367]  No, it's ridiculous.
[02:49:32.367 --> 02:49:39.811]  Basically, if you protest anything, anytime, anywhere, yeah, you are an extremist and possibly an Al-Qaeda insurgent.
[02:49:39.811 --> 02:49:41.072]  So, is it safe?
[02:49:41.072 --> 02:49:45.915]  It's safe if you know how to use it, if you know how much information about you you want to give out there.
[02:49:46.215 --> 02:49:58.843]  I mean, just by going to my MySpace page, you can figure out who my brother is, my sister, you can see a picture of my niece, you can track my family, you can see what friends I have, you can check their comments page and see what we've relayed back and forth.
[02:49:58.843 --> 02:50:06.989]  I mean, you really are setting yourself for an open source information bonanza, but it's up to you to decide how much Big Brother gets to know.
[02:50:06.989 --> 02:50:10.731]  I mean, you don't get that decision when you're just surfing the internet and they have your IP address.
[02:50:10.731 --> 02:50:11.652]  I hope that helps, Matt.
[02:50:11.992 --> 02:50:13.394]  I thank you for the call.
[02:50:13.394 --> 02:50:18.859]  We're going to come back in the final segment with Bob Chapman and Bob Dacey.
[02:50:18.859 --> 02:50:22.723]  We're also going to try to hit as many calls as we can.
[02:50:22.723 --> 02:50:29.851]  What do you think, Mr. Chapman, is the most impending issue coming up on the horizon in Congress and in the Senate?
[02:50:31.491 --> 02:50:33.332]  Well, you've got several.
[02:50:33.332 --> 02:50:36.434]  You've got the health care fiasco.
[02:50:36.434 --> 02:50:39.136]  You've got cap-and-trade fiasco.
[02:50:39.136 --> 02:50:41.858]  And then you've got the H.R.
[02:50:41.858 --> 02:50:45.981]  1207, which is being held captive in House Committee.
[02:50:45.981 --> 02:50:48.242]  That's what we need to talk about in the final segment.
[02:50:48.242 --> 02:50:49.023]  We need to talk about 1207.
[02:50:49.023 --> 02:50:51.405]  We need to talk about the co-sponsors.
[02:50:51.405 --> 02:50:57.389]  And we have to talk about Nancy Pelosi's odd response last week that nobody's picked up on but Prison Planet.
[02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:58.850]  It's going to be in Obama, too.
[02:50:58.850 --> 02:51:00.631]  I'm Jason Berman, sitting in for an Alex Jones.
[02:51:00.891 --> 02:51:01.412]  Back after this.
[02:51:24.195 --> 02:51:31.321]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:51:31.321 --> 02:51:32.442]  And here's the best part.
[02:51:32.442 --> 02:51:39.127]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:51:45.492 --> 02:51:45.672]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:52.819 --> 02:51:53.340]  0365.
[02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:58.164]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:51:58.164 --> 02:52:01.647]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:52:01.647 --> 02:52:03.088]  It is a big idea.
[02:52:03.088 --> 02:52:05.891]  A new world order.
[02:52:05.891 --> 02:52:10.414]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:52:10.414 --> 02:52:13.637]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:13.637 --> 02:52:16.420]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:18.802]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:19.574 --> 02:52:26.908]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:29.929 --> 02:52:35.373]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:35.373 --> 02:52:39.235]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:39.235 --> 02:52:41.817]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:41.817 --> 02:52:42.978]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:42.978 --> 02:52:43.758]  They're not after money.
[02:52:43.758 --> 02:52:45.039]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:45.039 --> 02:52:46.020]  They're after power.
[02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:47.161]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:54:14.082 --> 02:54:18.944]  I'll be in on Sunday for the first hour and 15 minutes of the program.
[02:54:19.484 --> 02:54:21.586]  And Alex will be rejoining us on Monday.
[02:54:21.586 --> 02:54:26.510]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in, joined by Bob Dacey and Bob Chapman.
[02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:27.811]  And a lot of people missed this.
[02:54:27.811 --> 02:54:29.292]  I hadn't seen any articles on it.
[02:54:29.292 --> 02:54:31.053]  I haven't seen the video on YouTube.
[02:54:31.053 --> 02:54:31.934]  Kind of hard to find.
[02:54:31.934 --> 02:54:33.215]  We taped it off C-SPAN.
[02:54:33.215 --> 02:54:35.977]  But in Nancy Pelosi's weekly address...
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:41.143]  She was asked about HR 1207 and auditing the Federal Reserve.
[02:55:08.704 --> 02:55:15.140]  Well, as the head of the House of Representatives, she's either a bald-faced liar or she's a moron.
[02:55:17.098 --> 02:55:18.519]  It may be a little bit of both.
[02:55:18.519 --> 02:55:20.241]  Well, you know, she's not a moron.
[02:55:20.241 --> 02:55:21.161]  She's very cunning.
[02:55:21.161 --> 02:55:22.242]  She's very smart.
[02:55:22.242 --> 02:55:24.864]  She's actually 69 years old, which I didn't realize.
[02:55:24.864 --> 02:55:26.685]  She looks pretty good for a 69-year-old.
[02:55:26.685 --> 02:55:28.306]  It's the multiple facelifts.
[02:55:28.306 --> 02:55:30.048]  It must be the multiple facelifts.
[02:55:30.048 --> 02:55:35.732]  But my contention is this is a woman who is very politically savvy, almost predatorial.
[02:55:35.732 --> 02:55:40.956]  She's somebody who was the lead Democrat in the initial congressional investigation into 9-11.
[02:55:41.756 --> 02:55:49.517]  She's the person that brought us, no, we're not going to bring the Bush administration up on war crimes, and no, impeachment is off the table.
[02:55:49.517 --> 02:55:58.759]  So to me, this woman is a political player who wants to get as high in the ranks as she possibly can on behalf of her masters in the elite ruling class.
[02:55:58.759 --> 02:56:00.019]  Exactly.
[02:56:00.019 --> 02:56:01.599]  I mean, I don't think... She's lying.
[02:56:01.599 --> 02:56:10.761]  And, you know, she's keeping it captive in there for as long as I can because she doesn't want to get out into the pool of the vote because it'll pass.
[02:56:11.656 --> 02:56:13.077]  I can't wait!
[02:56:32.612 --> 02:56:35.634]  If I didn't have to run to the bank after this show, you gotta see these things.
[02:56:35.634 --> 02:56:36.735]  I mean, I've got them back.
[02:56:36.735 --> 02:56:37.336]  I know about Barney.
[02:56:37.336 --> 02:56:45.382]  Yeah, out in the 90s where he's openly telling other congressmen to shut their mouths about the underage prostitution ring he's running in his D.C.
[02:56:45.382 --> 02:56:45.842]  home.
[02:56:45.842 --> 02:56:46.123]  Department.
[02:56:46.123 --> 02:56:50.266]  Yeah, and then all of a sudden it's just, slap on the wrist, oh, I'm not a Democrat anymore, I'm a Republican.
[02:56:50.706 --> 02:56:52.268]  Not a Republican anymore, I'm a Democrat.
[02:56:52.268 --> 02:57:03.998]  I don't want to be like, you know, Debbie Downer here, but if they did pass this bill to audit the Federal Reserve, I mean, wouldn't the powers that be just assign a whole bunch of CFR members to look into it, like they do all the time anyway?
[02:57:03.998 --> 02:57:05.460]  What's your take on that, Mr. Chapman?
[02:57:06.167 --> 02:57:10.328]  Well, that's possible, but I think you're going to get a hue and cry.
[02:57:10.328 --> 02:57:23.173]  People want action, and they're not getting it, and it's time to start howling about that fact that they're not being recognized or any of the things that they want are being looked into.
[02:57:23.766 --> 02:57:42.314]  Well, at the very least, I think that we want this hearing on the floor so, you know, people like us in the alternative media can at least tape that and then put it into a film and let millions and millions and millions of people see what actually happened and was kept away from them by both the government and the mainstream media and having an impact that way.
[02:57:42.314 --> 02:57:44.835]  That's true, and they're well aware of that.
[02:57:44.835 --> 02:57:50.397]  And, you know, we've got half the people in America now looking at the alternative media
[02:57:51.215 --> 02:58:05.305]  And as you've seen from the drop in advertising and the terrible problems the media is having, both print as well as radio and TV, we're gaining ground every single day on them.
[02:58:05.305 --> 02:58:09.127]  Because we're spewing out the truth, and really that's what the people want.
[02:58:09.127 --> 02:58:12.910]  There are people who don't want the truth because they just don't want to face it.
[02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:19.374]  And that's probably half the population, but if we can get half the people to understand what's going on, we can bring some fierce heat on them.
[02:58:19.764 --> 02:58:26.588]  If we can get a quarter of the people to understand what's going on and then take action after that, we've got a real shot at winning.
[02:58:26.588 --> 02:58:29.150]  Alex Jones coming up in the next segment.
[02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:30.411]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:58:30.411 --> 02:58:31.471]  Thank you, Bob Dacey.
[02:58:31.471 --> 02:58:32.932]  Thank you, Bob Chapman.
[02:58:32.932 --> 02:58:36.774]  All the latest and greatest over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:36.774 --> 02:58:46.260]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:48.442]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.049 --> 02:58:55.290]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:58:55.290 --> 02:58:57.290]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:58:57.290 --> 02:59:05.812]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:59:05.812 --> 02:59:11.354]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:59:11.354 --> 02:59:12.974]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:59:13.214 --> 02:59:19.739]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:59:19.739 --> 02:59:30.788]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:59:30.788 --> 02:59:31.569]  That's right.
[02:59:31.569 --> 02:59:34.131]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:59:34.131 --> 02:59:35.733]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:59:37.654 --> 02:59:38.114]  Big Brother.
[03:00:06.639 --> 03:00:07.260]  Heads up!
[03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:09.481]  Heads up, PrisonPlanet.tv members!
[03:00:30.521 --> 03:00:43.104]  In T-minus seven and a half minutes, we're going to start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV, the radio show.
[03:00:43.104 --> 03:00:45.605]  We'll then morph into a TV show for PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:00:45.605 --> 03:00:47.925]  Members, I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[03:00:47.925 --> 03:00:55.687]  Continuing with Open Phones today, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to break down some basics on eugenics and vampiric robots.
[03:00:57.150 --> 03:00:58.110]  Yes, you heard me right.
[03:00:58.110 --> 03:01:00.311]  Vampiric robots.
[03:01:00.311 --> 03:01:02.931]  Vampire robots.
[03:01:02.931 --> 03:01:07.852]  Look, truth stranger than fiction, it's AP, it's Reuters, it's Fox News.
[03:01:07.852 --> 03:01:10.213]  They gotta fund themselves on your dead bodies.
[03:01:10.213 --> 03:01:13.313]  That's how they feed.
[03:01:13.313 --> 03:01:14.354]  Zombie robots.
[03:01:14.354 --> 03:01:15.134]  I can't handle it.
[03:01:15.134 --> 03:01:19.575]  God, these people we're fighting are so psychopathic, so evil.
[03:01:19.575 --> 03:01:21.195]  They invent new evils every day.
[03:01:21.195 --> 03:01:22.815]  I mean, I would never have thought of that.
[03:01:22.815 --> 03:01:24.996]  They fund themselves on our dead bodies.
[03:01:24.996 --> 03:01:26.116]  But actually, that is the matrix.
[03:01:27.054 --> 03:01:36.200]  And the Army report from 68 declassified in January of 2000, which they then admitted that the Wachowski brothers had seen parts of before it was declassified.
[03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:53.290]  I guess the Army did say we would be batteries in hive tanks, and since perception is reality, we would all be hooked into these group hive tanks, and that our own body heat would run the computers that would give us rapture-like happiness.
[03:01:53.290 --> 03:01:54.011]  Philip K. Dick,
[03:01:54.875 --> 03:02:03.779]  You know, got raided and had his safe blown open by the feds because when he wrote about all that, the feds flipped out in the seventies and thought he'd been given classified info.
[03:02:03.779 --> 03:02:06.860]  I've talked to folks very close to the dick of state.
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:07.661]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:02:07.661 --> 03:02:08.761]  I have a video clip.
[03:02:08.761 --> 03:02:18.546]  Tommy Pallotto was telling me about that a few years ago, about talking to Dick's daughters and about some of the feds and things and why they raided him.
[03:02:18.546 --> 03:02:21.287]  But now we know why, because so much of what Dick's books were about
[03:02:22.341 --> 03:02:28.345]  He had just envisioned, almost psychically many believe, and then that's actually what their program was.
[03:02:28.345 --> 03:02:31.928]  But regardless, the government plans to put us all in tanks.
[03:02:31.928 --> 03:02:33.389]  That's full-spectrum dominance.
[03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:35.010]  You see those tanks in Matrix?
[03:02:35.010 --> 03:02:37.451]  That's a Pentagon full-spectrum dominance plan.
[03:02:37.451 --> 03:02:41.274]  Because no one can resist them worldwide if we're all in tanks, including the military.
[03:02:42.159 --> 03:02:44.801]  Hey, I know you feel like you just fell into the Twilight Zone.
[03:02:44.801 --> 03:02:47.202]  I'm only covering what they're saying they're gonna do.
[03:02:47.202 --> 03:02:48.943]  I mean, I'm not even saying they'll get away with it.
[03:02:48.943 --> 03:02:50.064]  These people are nuts.
[03:02:50.064 --> 03:02:58.689]  I mean, when I read Fox News headline, robots to feed off human flesh attack killer robots, I guess I hadn't seen that in government documents before.
[03:02:58.689 --> 03:03:00.250]  I was thinking that's something entirely new.
[03:03:00.250 --> 03:03:00.890]  I guess it's not.
[03:03:00.890 --> 03:03:08.415]  It's just instead of keeping you in a tank and your body heat feeding them, they're just gonna kill you and then feed on your flesh.
[03:03:09.798 --> 03:03:14.360]  And it's got a little bio-converter that does that.
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.921]  You gotta admit, that's a very liberal thing.
[03:03:16.921 --> 03:03:26.745]  It's like David Rothschild has a boat he sails around the world on that's powered by human waste.
[03:03:27.728 --> 03:03:32.650]  And he's very proud on TV as he gets up on the toilet and brags how he's doing it.
[03:03:32.650 --> 03:03:34.691]  See, it's all about how we're going to eat ourselves.
[03:03:34.691 --> 03:03:43.095]  Soylent Green is made out of people, but they're going to artificially shut off the resources to where we're basically forced into that type situation.
[03:03:43.095 --> 03:03:50.138]  Shutting down the resources.
[03:03:50.138 --> 03:03:53.039]  So, we will take your calls on these subjects.
[03:03:54.881 --> 03:03:56.763]  And a lot more coming up.
[03:03:56.763 --> 03:04:01.968]  In fact, you know, I just had this idea to get back into eugenics, and there's so many facets.
[03:04:01.968 --> 03:04:10.796]  Will you guys print me the story that Paul wrote about Obama's science czar wants to plan to sterilize people through the water already happening?
[03:04:10.796 --> 03:04:14.519]  I think that's kind of an important article.
[03:04:14.519 --> 03:04:19.624]  You know, major universities are finding that there's higher levels of hormones in the water than even should be from runoff.
[03:04:21.767 --> 03:04:26.229]  Water coming out of aquifers in major cities that isn't involved in runoff, as it added.
[03:04:26.229 --> 03:04:33.553]  Hmm... It's for your own good to save the Earth.
[03:04:33.553 --> 03:04:35.374]  You like living in a petri dish?
[03:04:35.374 --> 03:04:41.417]  You like the egghead chicken necks running everything?
[03:04:41.417 --> 03:04:43.298]  You like the little power trips they're on?
[03:04:44.915 --> 03:04:46.436]  So this is the revenge of the nerds.
[03:04:46.436 --> 03:04:49.779]  You think the nerds, oh the nerds didn't like not being cool in high school.
[03:04:49.779 --> 03:04:53.321]  But see now they get to sit back and watch you and your family die.
[03:04:53.321 --> 03:04:56.223]  They've got the power now.
[03:04:56.223 --> 03:04:59.766]  We'll go live at PrisonPlanet.TV with the real revenge of the nerds.
[03:05:01.187 --> 03:05:07.050]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[03:05:07.050 --> 03:05:08.351]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:05:08.351 --> 03:05:12.633]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[03:05:12.633 --> 03:05:14.493]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:05:14.493 --> 03:05:20.797]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:05:21.937 --> 03:05:24.798]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:05:24.798 --> 03:05:26.539]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:05:26.539 --> 03:05:29.541]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:05:29.541 --> 03:05:31.261]  And their formula really works.
[03:05:31.261 --> 03:05:34.083]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:05:34.083 --> 03:05:35.563]  Try the NutriCafe.
[03:05:35.563 --> 03:05:40.326]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[03:05:40.326 --> 03:05:42.747]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:05:42.747 --> 03:05:45.228]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:05:45.228 --> 03:05:47.309]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:05:47.309 --> 03:05:49.590]  Go to www.innerfood.com
[03:05:50.331 --> 03:05:52.656]  We're good to go.
[03:06:01.345 --> 03:06:06.546]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:06:06.546 --> 03:06:10.567]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:10.567 --> 03:06:16.469]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:21.530]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:28.071]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:06:28.071 --> 03:06:31.032]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here
[03:06:31.032 --> 03:06:31.372]  We're good.
[03:07:01.479 --> 03:07:03.400]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[03:07:03.400 --> 03:07:08.561]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[03:07:08.561 --> 03:07:11.402]  That's why you need to visit MainMilitary.com.

[03:08:13.798 --> 03:08:17.962]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.962 --> 03:08:22.025]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:35.759 --> 03:08:40.924]  We are now 8 minutes 30 seconds into the second hour of this four-hour transmission.
[03:08:40.924 --> 03:08:45.268]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:08:45.268 --> 03:08:46.289]  to 3 p.m.
[03:08:46.289 --> 03:08:50.613]  Central Standard Time.
[03:08:50.613 --> 03:08:51.233]  And then of course
[03:08:52.361 --> 03:08:57.265]  I also do a Sunday radio show, an abbreviated transmission from 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:57.265 --> 03:08:58.185]  Central Standard Time.
[03:08:58.185 --> 03:09:04.370]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:20.101]  Okay, since last Sunday, on Sunday and then Monday's show, I have been predominantly suspending my regularly scheduled radio transmissions and issues, and covering eugenics.
[03:09:21.181 --> 03:09:32.448]  Because eugenics was not just the dominant scientific thought of the Western world a hundred years ago, or seventy years ago, or even fifty years ago.
[03:09:32.448 --> 03:09:38.071]  It is hyper-dominant today.
[03:09:38.071 --> 03:09:45.196]  So I want to show folks this article right here by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:09:45.196 --> 03:09:49.979]  And if you go read the story at PrisonPlanet.com, it is the most
[03:09:52.506 --> 03:09:54.207]  Detailed out there.
[03:09:54.207 --> 03:10:00.972]  Since we began covering this over the weekend, World Net Daily and even some mainstream newspapers have picked up on the story.
[03:10:00.972 --> 03:10:08.437]  Fox News has covered it, so have some other national cable TV news networks.
[03:10:08.437 --> 03:10:16.523]  Obama's science advisor called for planetary regime to enforce totalitarian population control measures.
[03:10:18.615 --> 03:10:27.985]  And this is John Holdren, the science czar, over roughly 90% of technological and scientific development in the United States.
[03:10:27.985 --> 03:10:32.811]  And that's really an old number, with the Feds taking over, Chrysler and GM, it's even more.
[03:10:32.811 --> 03:10:40.139]  But right at 90% of technological research at universities and private institutions is federally funded.
[03:10:41.593 --> 03:10:45.336]  Taxpayer money and he wrote a policy book.
[03:10:45.336 --> 03:11:10.135]  He's also been the head of technology for Harvard and other institutions He also was high level at MIT at the time of writing the book and he wrote it with one of George Bush's top science advisors and the book is up on prison planet comm we have much of it scanned in and The book is eco science population resources and environment Paul R
[03:11:11.405 --> 03:11:27.479]  Erlich, one of George Bush's top advisors, co-wrote it with his wife, Anne H. Erlich, and with Obama's chief science advisor, John P. Holdren.
[03:11:27.479 --> 03:11:39.009]  Now, every claim we make in this detailed 18-page article is documented by scans of the pages that are up on the site.
[03:11:40.942 --> 03:11:46.486]  And every claim we make, every quote we read, we have his actual book.
[03:11:46.486 --> 03:11:50.929]  Now that said, I'm all about shattering the left-right paradigm.
[03:11:50.929 --> 03:11:58.995]  I'm all about getting past the fact that big offshore banks control both parties.
[03:11:58.995 --> 03:12:04.499]  So getting past liberal and conservative debates and realizing that both parties are bought and paid for by offshore interest.
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:09.280]  And perhaps you should link to this story.
[03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:11.681]  Paul Watson's got it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:12:11.681 --> 03:12:25.485]  He wrote a story about supposed left-wing website, NewsHounds, attacked us, said it was all a right-wing made-up figment of our imagination, that we have no proof, and then linked to PrisonPlanet.com and called us black helicopter kooks.
[03:12:28.874 --> 03:12:31.517]  Now, this is an example of mind control.
[03:12:31.517 --> 03:12:38.083]  Do the folks over at these liberal sites, not just newshounds, that are attacking us, do they really believe what they're saying?
[03:12:38.083 --> 03:12:40.786]  I mean, we scan the book.
[03:12:40.786 --> 03:12:44.010]  We have the book.
[03:12:44.010 --> 03:12:45.051]  We're nonpartisan.
[03:12:45.051 --> 03:12:46.652]  We're known for being nonpartisan.
[03:12:46.652 --> 03:12:52.098]  I cut my teeth going after Clinton as a globalist, then after George W. Bush, and now after Barack H. Obama.
[03:12:54.079 --> 03:12:55.220]  These guys are just puppets.
[03:12:55.220 --> 03:13:02.605]  We spend all day, every day explaining they're just front men who read off teleprompters.
[03:13:02.605 --> 03:13:05.767]  And we explain how you've always got to make it left wing or right wing.
[03:13:05.767 --> 03:13:08.929]  The right wing, when they're out of power, gets to blame the whole system on the left.
[03:13:08.929 --> 03:13:11.070]  And when the left's out of power, they blame it on the right wing.
[03:13:11.070 --> 03:13:19.616]  When both parties are two wings on the same bird of prey, known as the globalists, the scientific dictatorship.
[03:13:19.616 --> 03:13:21.677]  So, there's this issue of denial.
[03:13:25.208 --> 03:13:42.258]  Now, John P. Holdren is Obama's appointee, but Congress and George W. Bush, in the last eight years, had his co-author
[03:13:43.354 --> 03:13:45.215]  As one of their chief advisors.
[03:13:45.215 --> 03:13:47.495]  And we said that in the article.
[03:13:47.495 --> 03:13:49.496]  We've said that in our other articles.
[03:13:49.496 --> 03:13:52.077]  We wrote another article yesterday with his own quotes.
[03:13:52.077 --> 03:13:56.038]  And this is a policy report to academia and government.
[03:13:56.038 --> 03:14:03.001]  A textbook, a plan, a program that we see mirrored in United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment.
[03:14:03.001 --> 03:14:03.981]  Passes UN law 1996.
[03:14:03.981 --> 03:14:05.742]  State Department memorandum 200.
[03:14:05.742 --> 03:14:06.402]  CIA memorandum 200.
[03:14:11.383 --> 03:14:17.849]  Declassified in 92, made US official policy of the executive in 1973.
[03:14:17.849 --> 03:14:26.337]  I just sourced it for you, saying they use war, famine, sterilization, all of this to reduce world's population.
[03:14:26.337 --> 03:14:30.001]  I mean, whether you're for this or against it, you should know this is going on.
[03:14:30.001 --> 03:14:34.185]  I mean, I keep going back to this article.
[03:14:35.629 --> 03:14:46.595]  There's scores of these, and I played you the ABC News clip a few days ago, where they said, oh, the world's elite, Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and Bill Gates, and they've given over $130-something billion.
[03:14:46.595 --> 03:14:52.038]  They all met in secret, and they discussed how they want to help the poor.
[03:14:52.038 --> 03:14:56.241]  And then the group actually, Rockefeller University, that ran the meeting, actually
[03:14:57.938 --> 03:15:01.480]  Gave an interview to the Times of London, said, oh no, it was about how to reduce population.
[03:15:01.480 --> 03:15:04.062]  There's the headline, Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:15:04.062 --> 03:15:05.003]  So, U.S.
[03:15:05.003 --> 03:15:07.044]  media just said, oh, it's the Good Group.
[03:15:07.044 --> 03:15:08.885]  That's the name they call it, the Good Group.
[03:15:08.885 --> 03:15:13.488]  Not the Bilderberg Group, not the CFR, not a Bilderberg Group steering meeting, which it really was.
[03:15:13.488 --> 03:15:16.250]  It's the Good Group.
[03:15:16.250 --> 03:15:20.093]  So, Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:15:23.180 --> 03:15:27.263]  And they go over the world government, how a world government's needed to carry this out.
[03:15:27.263 --> 03:15:29.624]  I mean, this is one of the biggest newspapers in the world.
[03:15:29.624 --> 03:15:34.607]  The Times of London is in the top three biggest newspapers in the world.
[03:15:34.607 --> 03:15:41.331]  You can debate whether it's New York Times, Times of London, or London Guardian, who is the biggest, but it's one of those three.
[03:15:41.331 --> 03:15:43.733]  I mean, this newspaper exists.
[03:15:43.733 --> 03:15:48.536]  I want newshounds and others attacking me to know, I mean,
[03:15:49.841 --> 03:16:02.072]  I'm giving you Holdren's book, I've given you the scans, I've given you the quotes and what page they're on and posted the page for you and you just say I'm lying and making it up.
[03:16:02.072 --> 03:16:08.818]  Do you really believe the lies you're telling or are you delusional?
[03:16:08.818 --> 03:16:12.121]  I mean is it fun to call me a tinfoil hat wearing black helicopter pilot?
[03:16:16.479 --> 03:16:33.323]  I mean, I remember making Endgame two years ago, interviewing the heir to the Rothschild fortune, and I said, your carbon tax is a tax, you're planning to do home inspections, tax everything we do, that's in the UN documents, and he said, no it's not, it's not a tax, you're a liar.
[03:16:33.323 --> 03:16:37.423]  And I said, sir, you all know it's a tax now.
[03:16:37.423 --> 03:16:42.805]  I mean, we can't live in this denial.
[03:16:42.805 --> 03:16:44.305]  Saying this doesn't exist
[03:16:46.647 --> 03:16:49.189]  Doesn't stop it from being real.
[03:16:49.189 --> 03:16:50.671]  Perception is not reality.
[03:16:50.671 --> 03:17:04.983]  You can be wearing a virtual reality helmet that shows that you're walking on clouds, and that there's bluebirds flying past you, and angels playing harps, but if you walk off a 500-foot cliff and fall onto spikes below, you're gonna die.
[03:17:04.983 --> 03:17:07.746]  You can be wearing the virtual reality headset.
[03:17:07.746 --> 03:17:12.530]  And that's what this mainstream media and all this culture is, is a false projection
[03:17:13.726 --> 03:17:32.692]  Of what reality is that Saddam has WMDs and that 19 hijackers from a cave made NORAD stand down and carried out 9-11 and magic passports in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and in New York fell from the sky unburned and were found.
[03:17:32.692 --> 03:17:35.273]  That's false reality.
[03:17:35.273 --> 03:17:37.994]  That mercury is good for you.
[03:17:39.159 --> 03:17:40.180]  Is false reality.
[03:17:40.180 --> 03:17:45.783]  I have CBS News, I have MSNBC saying mercury and lead are now vitamins for your children.
[03:17:45.783 --> 03:17:51.866]  I mean, that's Monty Python humor, it sounds like, of some nightmare crazy future.
[03:17:51.866 --> 03:17:53.047]  But it's not.
[03:17:53.047 --> 03:17:56.108]  I have these newscasts, scores of them.
[03:17:56.108 --> 03:17:57.049]  We've played them many times.
[03:17:57.049 --> 03:17:59.870]  In fact, I might even get to them later.
[03:17:59.870 --> 03:18:04.213]  I do want to play a short clip, though, of MSNBC with Bayer Pharmaceutical.
[03:18:05.660 --> 03:18:14.122]  Knowingly shipping out over a million injections of Factor VIII blood drug, knowing all of the shots had HIV and hepatitis in them and would kill everybody that took it.
[03:18:14.122 --> 03:18:17.763]  And their own documents came out in court cases that they knew it and did it.
[03:18:17.763 --> 03:18:22.124]  Not because they wanted money, it was because they wanted to kill hemophiliacs.
[03:18:22.124 --> 03:18:27.205]  Bayer is a Nazi company.
[03:18:27.205 --> 03:18:28.525]  So is IG Farben.
[03:18:28.525 --> 03:18:30.446]  I assure you World War II existed.
[03:18:30.446 --> 03:18:31.806]  I assure you Hitler existed.
[03:18:32.774 --> 03:18:35.398]  I assure newshounds that this isn't a joke.
[03:18:35.398 --> 03:18:40.205]  You know, people always make fun of the Germans who didn't believe that Hitler had death camps.
[03:18:40.205 --> 03:18:47.895]  And that's why the generals made the Germans pile up the dead bodies themselves and burn them, the local townsfolks who were in denial.
[03:18:47.895 --> 03:18:49.638]  I believe that they didn't think it was going on.
[03:18:51.912 --> 03:19:02.780]  I mean, CPS here in Austin kidnaps hundreds of children every week and takes them to facilities where they admittedly rape them, and they're five to seven times more likely to be abused, and it comes out in the news all over the country.
[03:19:02.780 --> 03:19:07.543]  Pedophiles run these facilities, and no one gets in trouble, and the general public's in denial about that.
[03:19:07.543 --> 03:19:11.546]  I mean, you've got rape camps.
[03:19:11.546 --> 03:19:19.652]  I mean, half the prisons around Austin have been shut down, and new companies have gotten the contracts, because they film porno movies raping the kids and women at them.
[03:19:22.267 --> 03:19:23.968]  There'll be a blurb in the newspaper about it.
[03:19:23.968 --> 03:19:26.870]  I mean, we're living in the middle of a nightmare.
[03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:35.815]  But it's been incrementally kind of a background noise of tyranny and death and genocide and soft kill weapons slowly being turned up.
[03:19:35.815 --> 03:19:41.418]  To now, it's just a huge, bellowing cacophony of sound.
[03:19:41.418 --> 03:19:41.478]  And
[03:19:45.757 --> 03:19:51.444]  Corruption and murder and tyranny and people can't even hear the tyranny, it's so loud.
[03:19:51.444 --> 03:19:57.392]  We're going to break down the eugenics of the master plan after this quick break, get into the latest developments.
[03:19:57.392 --> 03:19:59.014]  This is key information, stay with us.
[03:20:01.544 --> 03:20:03.586]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[03:20:03.586 --> 03:20:06.528]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[03:20:06.528 --> 03:20:08.770]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[03:20:08.770 --> 03:20:09.750]  Here's the story.
[03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:14.554]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[03:20:14.554 --> 03:20:15.795]  Now here's the bad news.
[03:20:15.795 --> 03:20:19.078]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[03:20:19.358 --> 03:20:19.578]  We're good.
[03:20:35.305 --> 03:20:44.308]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[03:20:44.308 --> 03:20:49.489]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[03:20:49.489 --> 03:20:53.611]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[03:20:53.611 --> 03:20:56.631]  That's makeherbalmedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:20:56.631 --> 03:20:57.372]  It is a big idea.
[03:20:57.372 --> 03:20:58.012]  A new world order.
[03:21:05.669 --> 03:21:10.152]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[03:21:10.152 --> 03:21:13.394]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:13.394 --> 03:21:16.175]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:21:16.175 --> 03:21:19.357]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:19.357 --> 03:21:26.682]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:29.707 --> 03:21:35.151]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:35.151 --> 03:21:39.013]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:39.013 --> 03:21:41.575]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:41.575 --> 03:21:42.756]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:42.756 --> 03:21:43.516]  They're not after money.
[03:21:43.516 --> 03:21:44.817]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:44.817 --> 03:21:45.798]  They're after power.
[03:21:45.798 --> 03:21:46.939]  That's what they're after these days.
[03:21:46.939 --> 03:21:51.702]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:21:51.702 --> 03:21:55.664]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:55.664 --> 03:21:58.466]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:21:58.466 --> 03:21:59.547]  You have been warned.
[03:22:00.288 --> 03:22:00.888]  Good day.
[03:22:00.888 --> 03:22:02.770]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:02.770 --> 03:22:03.170]  July 17, 2009.
[03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:04.291]  Gold opened this morning at $9.3560.
[03:22:04.291 --> 03:22:07.954]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.6247, $4.8124 for a half ounce, or $2.4062 for the quarter ounce.
[03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:20.321]  That's $962.47, $481.24, and $240.62.
[03:22:20.321 --> 03:22:33.943]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:33.943 --> 03:22:42.525]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:42.805 --> 03:22:43.886]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:43.886 --> 03:22:48.248]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:48.248 --> 03:22:49.328]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:49.328 --> 03:22:50.589]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:50.589 --> 03:22:51.430]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.430 --> 03:22:51.730]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.055 --> 03:23:04.078]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:04.078 --> 03:23:09.402]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:09.402 --> 03:23:11.444]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:11.444 --> 03:23:16.449]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:16.449 --> 03:23:16.749]  How much
[03:23:16.749 --> 03:23:17.630]  Which do you want?
[03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:18.751]  When do you want it?
[03:23:18.751 --> 03:23:20.632]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:20.632 --> 03:23:21.713]  When will you need it?
[03:23:21.713 --> 03:23:23.915]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:23.915 --> 03:23:25.257]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:25.257 --> 03:23:26.778]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:23:26.778 --> 03:23:32.063]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:32.063 --> 03:23:35.646]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:35.646 --> 03:23:39.109]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:39.449 --> 03:23:40.670]  How much will you need?
[03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:41.570]  We don't know.
[03:23:41.570 --> 03:23:42.690]  How much do you want?
[03:23:42.690 --> 03:23:43.611]  All you can get.
[03:23:43.611 --> 03:23:44.711]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:44.711 --> 03:23:47.752]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:47.752 --> 03:23:49.533]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:49.533 --> 03:23:50.453]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:06.964 --> 03:24:08.646]  I don't know.
[03:24:25.663 --> 03:24:37.147]  The globalists are counting on being so bold, so over the top, so outrageous, drugging your food, your water, putting poisons and toxins in the air by design, as Holdren's now and the AP and Reuters.
[03:24:37.147 --> 03:24:42.108]  By the way, we finally found a video of him at that science conference.
[03:24:42.108 --> 03:24:44.089]  No one had it.
[03:24:44.089 --> 03:24:47.930]  I was up until one in the morning and the guys were up even later, so they're not here.
[03:24:47.930 --> 03:24:51.131]  The minute that Watson and Aaron come in, are they in yet?
[03:24:54.178 --> 03:24:54.838]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:24:54.838 --> 03:24:57.520]  Robin Aaron Watson isn't in this office.
[03:24:57.520 --> 03:24:58.561]  Watson's writing the articles.
[03:24:58.561 --> 03:25:01.423]  The minute they get in, send that to Watson.
[03:25:01.423 --> 03:25:02.864]  In fact, I meant to put that on your desk.
[03:25:02.864 --> 03:25:04.285]  Will you call them and see when they're getting in?
[03:25:04.285 --> 03:25:08.427]  I want to play that during this hour before things run out of time.
[03:25:08.427 --> 03:25:13.250]  You know, that's the problem here going over this evidence is there's just so much.
[03:25:13.250 --> 03:25:21.496]  I don't just have AP and Reuters with Holdren saying, spray the atmosphere with aluminum dioxide and barium salts that cause all these degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer's.
[03:25:22.296 --> 03:25:27.501]  I now have the video of him at the press conference.
[03:25:27.501 --> 03:25:29.222]  It's just totally insane.
[03:25:29.222 --> 03:25:31.945]  All of it is just totally insane.
[03:25:31.945 --> 03:25:34.127]  It's all off the charts.
[03:25:34.127 --> 03:25:38.951]  Okay, let me just go over the basic facts here.
[03:25:38.951 --> 03:25:41.373]  The mindsets of these people.
[03:25:41.373 --> 03:25:46.858]  Some of the documents you want to read are State Department of Random 200, United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 1996,
[03:25:50.431 --> 03:26:14.830]  Uh, books written by people like Holdren, Ecoscience, Population, Resources and Environment, If I Was an Animal, written by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, books written by Jacques Cousteau, books written by Ted Turner, statements by Ted Turner saying kill 80% of the useless feeders, statements by Hitler, I also put under the record Mein Kampf,
[03:26:15.615 --> 03:26:22.238]  And I just want to tell newshounds and others attacking me, Hitler existed, even if you say he didn't.
[03:26:22.238 --> 03:26:25.019]  What Hitler did, existed.
[03:26:44.088 --> 03:26:48.529]  And giggling, yuppie smirking about this doesn't change it.
[03:26:48.529 --> 03:26:50.049]  Okay.
[03:26:50.049 --> 03:26:51.949]  Just a few of the sources.
[03:26:51.949 --> 03:26:55.010]  Paul Watson's 18-page report.
[03:26:55.010 --> 03:27:00.831]  Also the other report, Obama Science Czar Plan to Sterilize Population Through Water Supply Already Happening.
[03:27:00.831 --> 03:27:08.932]  We'll put that up on screen for you as well here at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:27:08.932 --> 03:27:10.993]  Here are some of the notes I wrote before I went on air.
[03:27:10.993 --> 03:27:13.313]  Just areas I want to discuss dealing with this.
[03:27:14.406 --> 03:27:40.628]  History, the flu, the forced flu shots, how that ties into that, how we're under a microscope, how we're basically lab rats in this controlled, engineered society under the globalist control, how it's a scientific dictatorship, some of the top global planners that have been openly talking about killing the majority of us that have gotten attention, how this is so horrible people have trouble facing it and dealing with it,
[03:27:43.758 --> 03:27:49.521]  And the mindset of the elites and how, in their own internal documents, this has nothing to do with the environment and the earth.
[03:27:49.521 --> 03:28:00.747]  They want a manageable group of people to deal with, and it's all part of being the priest of power, deciding who lives and who dies, and exterminating the majority of the world population, including the most intelligent.
[03:28:00.747 --> 03:28:03.709]  Unless you're part of the elite families, you are dead.
[03:28:03.709 --> 03:28:06.570]  You are to be hunted down and killed.
[03:28:06.570 --> 03:28:11.913]  So we will go through all this in the long segment coming up.
[03:28:14.451 --> 03:28:22.276]  But I do want to direct everybody to the quotes of John P. Holdren in his government textbook.
[03:28:22.276 --> 03:28:31.142]  Forcibly and unknowingly sterilizing the entire population by adding infertility drugs, legalizing compulsory abortions, i.e.
[03:28:31.142 --> 03:28:38.007]  forced abortions carried out against the will of the pregnant women, as is commonplace in Communist China, which is funded by the U.S.
[03:28:38.007 --> 03:28:39.288]  to do this, where women
[03:28:40.791 --> 03:28:50.280]  Who have already had one child and refused to abort the second or kidnapped off the street by the authorities before a procedure is carried out to forcibly abort the baby.
[03:28:50.280 --> 03:28:54.944]  Babies are then many times actually kept alive and sold for medical experiments and then killed.
[03:28:54.944 --> 03:28:57.086]  People worry about them killing monkeys and apes.
[03:28:57.086 --> 03:28:58.347]  Hell, they got babies, baby.
[03:28:59.910 --> 03:29:12.300]  Remember, Hitler also thanks in his speeches and books in Mein Kampf the United States for the concentration camp plan adopted from the British of putting people in camps and starving them to death and using bio-weapon attacks.
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:16.324]  Holdren's also part of the Pugwash Society set up by Nobel Prize winning eugenicist
[03:29:18.055 --> 03:29:33.967]  Bertrand Russell, where he says, we can't nuke countries when they hit us with bio-weapons, because the bio-attacks will actually be good to reduce our numbers, because they're planning to release bio-weapons, claim a third world country did it, and they don't want to have a nuclear war that might actually hurt the elite.
[03:29:33.967 --> 03:29:36.048]  So they're getting you ready for your death.
[03:29:36.048 --> 03:29:42.993]  And Dr. Pianka, I have him here in the quotes, when he got questioned about wanting to kill 90% of us with airborne Ebola in 1996, he said, well, yes.
[03:29:45.755 --> 03:29:48.297]  And me and my family are ready to die, too.
[03:29:48.297 --> 03:29:51.619]  We're ready to kill ourselves, basically.
[03:29:51.619 --> 03:29:53.000]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.541]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.541 --> 03:29:58.223]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.087 --> 03:30:02.469]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:04.451]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:30:04.451 --> 03:30:05.091]  Well, you should.
[03:30:05.091 --> 03:30:09.937]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:30:09.937 --> 03:30:10.738]  That's right.
[03:30:10.738 --> 03:30:19.407]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:30:19.407 --> 03:30:20.769]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:30:20.769 --> 03:30:21.910]  Plus, if you act fast.
[03:30:22.110 --> 03:30:28.074]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:30:28.074 --> 03:30:34.979]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:30:34.979 --> 03:30:40.503]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:30:40.503 --> 03:30:41.964]  This is real.
[03:30:41.964 --> 03:30:43.024]  Don't miss out.
[03:30:43.024 --> 03:30:49.889]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[03:30:50.129 --> 03:30:51.570]  And get your free handgun.
[03:30:51.570 --> 03:30:53.931]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[03:30:53.931 --> 03:30:57.632]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[03:30:57.632 --> 03:31:01.374]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[03:31:01.374 --> 03:31:02.014]  Hello, friends.
[03:31:02.014 --> 03:31:03.074]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:31:03.074 --> 03:31:07.816]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:31:07.816 --> 03:31:10.777]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:31:10.777 --> 03:31:13.839]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:31:13.839 --> 03:31:19.681]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:31:19.901 --> 03:31:23.143]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:31:23.143 --> 03:31:30.128]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:31:30.128 --> 03:31:33.410]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:31:33.410 --> 03:31:35.291]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:38.553 --> 03:31:44.820]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:31:44.820 --> 03:31:48.585]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:48.585 --> 03:31:49.946]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:31:49.946 --> 03:31:50.567]  Take action today.
[03:31:50.567 --> 03:31:52.389]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:32:01.357 --> 03:32:04.460]  Did you know that you can be tracked and traced when you're online?
[03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:12.587]  With identity theft and cybercrimes on the rise, your passwords, your identity, and even your physical location can be revealed to complete strangers.
[03:32:12.587 --> 03:32:16.530]  Would you like to surf the internet anonymously and not have to worry about these threats?
[03:32:16.530 --> 03:32:19.693]  Well, now you can by visiting patriotinternet.com.
[03:32:19.693 --> 03:32:24.257]  For about $2 per month, patriotinternet.com will conceal your IP address and your
[03:32:24.377 --> 03:32:24.757]  I think so.
[03:32:48.387 --> 03:32:49.668]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:32:49.668 --> 03:32:49.968]  to 3 p.m.
[03:32:49.968 --> 03:32:50.928]  Central Standard Time.
[03:32:50.928 --> 03:32:51.668]  We're here live.
[03:32:51.668 --> 03:32:53.829]  All right, let me continue getting to the news.
[03:33:18.564 --> 03:33:32.993]  Eugenics, and I'm going to get into more of the scientific angles of it in their larger plans here in a moment, but eugenics is also about propagandizing the public to hate themselves, to think that the development is bad, private property is bad.
[03:33:32.993 --> 03:33:37.396]  Under eugenics, the family is bad because you owe allegiance to your family.
[03:33:37.396 --> 03:33:39.838]  You'll stand up for your family, not to the state.
[03:33:40.723 --> 03:33:49.647]  We posted scores of textbook links and articles where they say the family's a disease, the family's got to be eradicated, all families are mentally ill.
[03:33:49.647 --> 03:33:53.168]  And you look at the communist Chinese model where they're basically eradicating the family.
[03:33:53.168 --> 03:33:58.510]  Here's just the last few days without even looking where they're demonizing the family.
[03:33:58.510 --> 03:34:01.911]  Does having children make you unhappy?
[03:34:01.911 --> 03:34:05.573]  This is out of the New York Times and
[03:34:06.664 --> 03:34:09.365]  It says children are basically bad.
[03:34:09.365 --> 03:34:19.430]  When you read the article, it quotes the Journal of British Psychological Association saying the family is basically not good and is terrible.
[03:34:19.430 --> 03:34:23.012]  Now, I randomly just picked up an Atlantic Monthly last weekend.
[03:34:23.012 --> 03:34:27.394]  Half the magazine is global warming tax propaganda and world government tax propaganda.
[03:34:27.394 --> 03:34:29.835]  We covered that a few days ago.
[03:34:29.835 --> 03:34:31.836]  But on page 116, let's call the whole thing off.
[03:34:34.784 --> 03:34:36.685]  This author is ending her marriage.
[03:34:36.685 --> 03:34:40.607]  Isn't it time you did the same?
[03:34:40.607 --> 03:34:44.129]  And it says marriage is bad and sucks and family's bad.
[03:34:44.129 --> 03:34:47.431]  I mean, these people are sick.
[03:34:47.431 --> 03:34:50.653]  So, they always wanted to tear down family.
[03:34:50.653 --> 03:34:57.277]  They want to get you cornered, by yourself, so when they euthanize your butt, nobody's there to stand up for you.
[03:34:58.291 --> 03:34:59.011]  Okay?
[03:34:59.011 --> 03:35:00.852]  And then look, half the pages.
[03:35:00.852 --> 03:35:05.755]  Here's an oil company supporting global greenhouse taxes, Dutch Royal Shell.
[03:35:05.755 --> 03:35:07.535]  I mean, it's literally half the magazine.
[03:35:07.535 --> 03:35:10.597]  It is just unspeakable propaganda.
[03:35:10.597 --> 03:35:15.519]  And then they've got an article in here about how they want to chemtrail the public.
[03:35:15.519 --> 03:35:17.560]  And who is proposing that?
[03:35:17.560 --> 03:35:25.784]  Obama's climate czar is taking his orders from
[03:35:26.852 --> 03:35:31.195]  Mr. Holdren, John P. Holdren, the guy calling for the eugenics.
[03:35:31.195 --> 03:35:37.780]  And by the way, people say, oh well he wrote that textbook a long time ago calling for exterminating the majority of the population, sterilizing everybody.
[03:35:37.780 --> 03:35:38.921]  He wrote that a long time ago.
[03:35:38.921 --> 03:35:48.068]  Here he is in a mainstream news interview with displaying the book in his office proudly, Ecoscience, on the wall.
[03:35:48.068 --> 03:35:50.630]  Right there.
[03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:54.392]  There's the book.
[03:35:54.392 --> 03:35:55.153]  It's just so sick.
[03:35:56.223 --> 03:35:58.786]  And again, here's the Wall Street Journal saying terraformed things.
[03:35:58.786 --> 03:36:00.328]  And who's the guy that says this?
[03:36:00.328 --> 03:36:01.609]  Him!
[03:36:01.609 --> 03:36:02.450]  Holdren.
[03:36:02.450 --> 03:36:14.524]  Holdren is now saying, oh, we're gonna spray... ...aluminum dioxide on you to manipulate the weather to save the Earth, and then all these scientists go, wait a minute, that causes brain damage.
[03:36:14.524 --> 03:36:17.047]  And then, by the way, they've already been doing this program for decades.
[03:36:20.097 --> 03:36:22.479]  And then same article in here.
[03:36:22.479 --> 03:36:23.340]  It's just everywhere.
[03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:24.962]  We are swimming in it.
[03:36:24.962 --> 03:36:25.843]  Don't have kids.
[03:36:25.843 --> 03:36:27.024]  Don't have a family.
[03:36:27.024 --> 03:36:27.825]  Family's bad.
[03:36:27.825 --> 03:36:28.645]  Go out and party.
[03:36:28.645 --> 03:36:29.546]  Take drugs.
[03:36:29.546 --> 03:36:31.388]  Have a good time.
[03:36:31.388 --> 03:36:37.474]  Now, look at this article.
[03:36:37.474 --> 03:36:40.217]  This is out of Fox News.
[03:36:40.217 --> 03:36:41.918]  What does this have to do with eugenics?
[03:36:41.918 --> 03:36:43.860]  I'm going to explain it all to you in a moment.
[03:36:43.860 --> 03:36:44.501]  It is the key.
[03:36:45.854 --> 03:36:51.097]  Upcoming Military Robot Could Feed on Dead Bodies.
[03:36:51.097 --> 03:37:00.484]  Shouldn't the headline be Vampire Robot to Power Itself on Human Flesh?
[03:37:00.484 --> 03:37:03.926]  Intergenetically Autonomous Tactical Robot.
[03:37:03.926 --> 03:37:05.627]  Or The Eater.
[03:37:05.627 --> 03:37:08.449]  What a nice name, The Eater.
[03:37:08.449 --> 03:37:13.472]  Can make a nice horror movie called Eaters with the robots that feed off human flesh.
[03:37:13.472 --> 03:37:14.413]  That's Fox News.
[03:37:15.742 --> 03:37:19.003]  It's also in the Associated Press.
[03:37:19.003 --> 03:37:23.685]  What does that have to do with this little article out of the BBC?
[03:37:23.685 --> 03:37:27.186]  Foot and mouth vial went missing.
[03:37:27.186 --> 03:37:34.769]  Oh, that's a photo of thousands of dead cows burning in apocalyptic fashion.
[03:37:34.769 --> 03:37:38.950]  With their legs sticking up in the flames, smoking.
[03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:40.431]  What does that have to do with
[03:37:44.608 --> 03:37:50.609]  The headlines today about how they're preparing for forced inoculations of the American people and the British people.
[03:37:50.609 --> 03:38:01.911]  And this doesn't mean they'll get away with it, but they're on ABC News, Fox, CNN, we've played the clips, saying forced compulsory injections are coming!
[03:38:01.911 --> 03:38:03.691]  How does all this tie together with eugenics?
[03:38:03.691 --> 03:38:12.573]  Well, I was reading to you, Holdren, Obama's science advisor called for a planetary regime to enforce totalitarian population control measures.
[03:38:13.914 --> 03:38:20.156]  Babies who were born out of wedlock or teenage mothers to be forcibly taken away from their mother by the government and put it up for adoption.
[03:38:20.156 --> 03:38:28.780]  Another purported measure would force single mothers to demonstrate to the government that they can care for their child, effectively introducing licensing to have children.
[03:38:28.780 --> 03:38:30.941]  He calls for licensing of children actually in here.
[03:38:30.941 --> 03:38:36.723]  And they talk about hunting down, of course they're already hunting down Christian families and grabbing their kids at home school.
[03:38:38.166 --> 03:38:45.669]  Implement a system of involuntary birth control, where both men and women would be mandated to have an infertility device implanted in their body.
[03:38:45.669 --> 03:38:50.911]  Permanently sterilizing people who the authorities deemed to have too many children.
[03:38:50.911 --> 03:38:57.373]  Formally passing a law that criminalizes having more than two children, similar to the one-child policy in Communist China.
[03:38:57.373 --> 03:39:01.515]  They already demonize on the news families that have more than one kid.
[03:39:01.515 --> 03:39:06.597]  In fact, I have the newscast on Fox News saying, having more than one kid is bad for the Earth!
[03:39:06.597 --> 03:39:07.157]  Shouldn't do it!
[03:39:07.890 --> 03:39:10.591]  In fact, Google for folks on screen right now.
[03:39:10.591 --> 03:39:13.232]  Having more than one child bad for Earth.
[03:39:13.232 --> 03:39:17.474]  Or, babies have bad carbon footprint.
[03:39:17.474 --> 03:39:20.536]  Or, tax children for carbon footprint.
[03:39:20.536 --> 03:39:23.097]  This is a tax on human activity.
[03:39:23.097 --> 03:39:28.739]  On the two and a half pounds of CO2 you put off a day that plants breathe.
[03:39:28.739 --> 03:39:33.261]  See, they're not putting a tax on cross-species genetic engineering that's very dangerous to the environment.
[03:39:33.261 --> 03:39:36.182]  They're not putting taxes on toxic waste being dumped in the ocean.
[03:39:36.182 --> 03:39:37.043]  They're not putting... No, no.
[03:39:38.154 --> 03:39:46.340]  This is a tax on what you exhale, brother, and their own government documents call it a tax on breathing to end the industrial system.
[03:39:46.340 --> 03:39:56.668]  There'll only be technology in government, technological reservations of highly advanced technology we won't even have access to, including life extension.
[03:39:56.668 --> 03:40:00.551]  There's the Times of London, having large families is an eco-crime.
[03:40:00.551 --> 03:40:02.553]  Here, let's show people another one.
[03:40:02.553 --> 03:40:07.597]  Great job, guys.
[03:40:07.597 --> 03:40:07.857]  Print
[03:40:09.093 --> 03:40:11.034]  Print this one.
[03:40:11.034 --> 03:40:17.938]  Environment Chief, British Environment Chief says, reduce British population to 30 million.
[03:40:17.938 --> 03:40:30.726]  He wants it forcibly cut in half, and that means euthanasia, sterilization, and they've done university studies, Watson wrote about it, Obama Science Advisor, plan to sterilize population, the water supply already happening.
[03:40:30.726 --> 03:40:32.007]  They're already adding it to the water.
[03:40:33.283 --> 03:40:37.144]  Well water that cities pump out magically ends up with these chemicals in it.
[03:40:37.144 --> 03:40:38.444]  They're adding it.
[03:40:38.444 --> 03:40:39.505]  This is confirmed.
[03:40:39.505 --> 03:40:44.286]  It's happening right here in Austin as well.
[03:40:44.286 --> 03:40:52.648]  Now, I have the same headline out of Canada, the same headline out of Australia, and the same headline out of the US.
[03:40:53.556 --> 03:40:55.337]  Environment Chief says we have to cut the U.S.
[03:40:55.337 --> 03:40:56.738]  population by half.
[03:40:56.738 --> 03:41:00.279]  Environment Minister in Australia says we've got to cut Australian population in half.
[03:41:00.279 --> 03:41:03.601]  New Zealand, Environment Minister says they've got to cut the population in half.
[03:41:03.601 --> 03:41:18.888]  The same week, every Environment Minister from Cairo, Egypt, to England, to Scotland, to Ireland, to Canada, and the U.S., every major nation under IMF World Bank control, came out with a headline you see.
[03:41:18.888 --> 03:41:21.750]  UK population must fall to 30 million, says
[03:41:22.876 --> 03:41:23.937]  Environment Chief.
[03:41:23.937 --> 03:41:28.841]  One of Gordon Brown's leading green advisors is to warn Britain must drastically reduce its population.
[03:41:28.841 --> 03:41:37.708]  Seek to build a sustainable society from 60 million to 30 million.
[03:41:37.708 --> 03:41:42.632]  Now already with the government programming, the British population is dropping by near half.
[03:41:42.632 --> 03:41:50.358]  The indigenous Britons have a 1.1 population replacement rate.
[03:41:51.258 --> 03:42:05.907]  England overall has a 1.4 for every mommy and daddy they have 1.4 kids and that's counting the hundreds of thousands of legal and illegal aliens brought in yearly that are now counted as domestic births.
[03:42:05.907 --> 03:42:08.529]  England is now approaching total collapse.
[03:42:09.489 --> 03:42:12.630]  You know what happens when you only start having one child for every parent?
[03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:18.312]  Within a generation, your population is cut in half, and then it's almost impossible to start breeding back to the last levels.
[03:42:18.312 --> 03:42:27.855]  The eugenicist Nazis are actually targeting Anglo-Saxons and Germanic tribes, and also Jews.
[03:42:27.855 --> 03:42:30.016]  They always pay to kill Jews for some reason.
[03:42:30.016 --> 03:42:30.476]  The U.S.
[03:42:30.476 --> 03:42:33.137]  paid Israel to radiate 110,000 Sephardic Jews, the brown Jews.
[03:42:35.698 --> 03:42:50.623]  So you have to understand, this eugenic society is Jews involved, Nazis involved, the Chinese publicly signed treaties to carry out the one-child policy under State Department memorandum 200 to get the IMF World Bank money.
[03:42:50.623 --> 03:42:52.164]  India signed deals.
[03:42:52.164 --> 03:42:53.664]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[03:42:53.664 --> 03:42:56.205]  Just Google this for them then.
[03:42:56.205 --> 03:43:03.208]  Do Peru or India sign deal with IMF World Bank to reduce population or
[03:43:04.412 --> 03:43:07.733]  India signed deal to reduce population.
[03:43:07.733 --> 03:43:09.994]  And you can read the headlines going back 30 years.
[03:43:09.994 --> 03:43:13.475]  And they just grab women off the street and say, we're sterilizing you.
[03:43:13.475 --> 03:43:15.396]  We gotta get that cash.
[03:43:15.396 --> 03:43:18.677]  And the politicians get to keep some of that cash themselves.
[03:43:18.677 --> 03:43:21.418]  For hard cash!
[03:43:21.418 --> 03:43:26.560]  For nothing but paper, printed up by the New World Order out of nothing.
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:29.841]  Those people will sell their own soul!
[03:43:29.841 --> 03:43:33.042]  Oh, but again, we shouldn't be talking about all this here.
[03:43:34.267 --> 03:43:40.628]  We should be talking about Michael Jackson and how that's important.
[03:43:40.628 --> 03:43:46.469]  See folks, their propaganda is everywhere.
[03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:47.730]  Their eugenics propaganda.
[03:43:47.730 --> 03:43:52.051]  They're now selling us and they're already putting in your water and your food and your vaccines.
[03:43:52.051 --> 03:44:03.493]  And for all of you out there that serve this system and believe in this system and like this system, for all of you out there who are into this,
[03:44:07.003 --> 03:44:09.224]  You are being attacked as well.
[03:44:09.224 --> 03:44:10.825]  That's the most important point I can make.
[03:44:10.825 --> 03:44:17.287]  Now, let me continue to go over this.
[03:44:17.287 --> 03:44:18.427]  The history.
[03:44:18.427 --> 03:44:20.008]  And I'm just going to be brief about this.
[03:44:20.008 --> 03:44:20.388]  There it is.
[03:44:20.388 --> 03:44:23.109]  Forced sterilization in Peru.
[03:44:23.109 --> 03:44:27.931]  Committee on Women, Population and Environment.
[03:44:27.931 --> 03:44:30.852]  That's a non-governmental UN organization right there telling you about it.
[03:44:30.852 --> 03:44:33.673]  Yeah.
[03:44:33.673 --> 03:44:35.013]  You can pull the name of any country.
[03:44:35.013 --> 03:44:36.074]  Nigeria, Brazil,
[03:44:37.315 --> 03:44:40.700]  The United States pull up for sterilization of women in the United States.
[03:44:40.700 --> 03:44:43.063]  It's still going on, by the way.
[03:44:43.063 --> 03:44:45.025]  They drug these women up out of their minds.
[03:44:45.025 --> 03:44:46.527]  They do thousands of them a month still.
[03:44:46.527 --> 03:44:48.610]  And then they say, oh, sign a form.
[03:44:48.610 --> 03:44:49.772]  We can sterilize you.
[03:44:49.772 --> 03:44:50.533]  Then we'll let you go.
[03:44:50.533 --> 03:44:53.116]  Then they tie her tubes and throw her back out on the street.
[03:44:54.025 --> 03:44:55.406]  And again, they've got their excuses.
[03:44:55.406 --> 03:44:58.248]  Oh, this is white trash, or, you know, this is a poor black lady.
[03:44:58.248 --> 03:44:59.088]  They deserve it.
[03:44:59.088 --> 03:45:01.830]  It's the precedent it sets, folks, and they're doing it to you.
[03:45:01.830 --> 03:45:10.555]  So, get yourself a big glass of tap water and just... I love being self-medicated and all the other health problems it gives you.
[03:45:10.555 --> 03:45:14.437]  And this is the stuff we know they're doing.
[03:45:14.437 --> 03:45:16.879]  So the history of this is, 150 years ago,
[03:45:19.361 --> 03:45:22.824]  Sir Galton and others in England developed this plan of eugenics.
[03:45:22.824 --> 03:45:26.427]  By the turn of the last century, 109 years ago, it was adopted.
[03:45:26.427 --> 03:45:36.476]  The Rockefeller family, the Rothschild family, and the Saxe-Coburg Gothas, the elites had always believed in breeding and genetics and that their bloodlines were best, even before they had the term genetics.
[03:45:36.476 --> 03:45:40.859]  You know, kings and queens intermarrying, interbreeding, believing they had the royal bloodline.
[03:45:40.859 --> 03:45:42.200]  I assure you kings and queens exist.
[03:45:44.383 --> 03:45:45.544]  That's the history of it.
[03:45:45.544 --> 03:45:52.608]  They then love the scientists that told them, you're the elites, you're the god race, you're the best, these are all inferior, we've got to cull them.
[03:45:52.608 --> 03:45:54.409]  Many other societies had done that.
[03:45:54.409 --> 03:45:57.550]  The Israelites had culled their enemies when they came into Israel.
[03:45:57.550 --> 03:46:00.272]  The Babylonians would cull their enemies.
[03:46:00.272 --> 03:46:04.814]  When they finally beat Hannibal, the Romans, they culled and killed whole cities.
[03:46:04.814 --> 03:46:08.396]  Julius Caesar in the Battle for Gaul talks about wiping out whole groups.
[03:46:08.396 --> 03:46:11.138]  Very old, ancient human instinct.
[03:46:11.138 --> 03:46:13.019]  Total war to kill all your enemies.
[03:46:14.656 --> 03:46:20.938]  And so they cold-bloodedly decided, we will create an environmental movement, 110 years ago, set up by John D. Rockefeller.
[03:46:20.938 --> 03:46:23.439]  He coined the term environmental movement and conservation.
[03:46:23.439 --> 03:46:24.179]  Nothing to do with it.
[03:46:24.179 --> 03:46:26.480]  It was all about stealing land and property.
[03:46:26.480 --> 03:46:28.360]  They then set up eugenics.
[03:46:28.360 --> 03:46:31.161]  By 1910, they were already killing babies out of the womb.
[03:46:31.161 --> 03:46:34.062]  The doctor would come and kill the baby, the poor person's baby.
[03:46:34.062 --> 03:46:37.243]  By the 1920s, you made less than a B+.
[03:46:37.243 --> 03:46:38.484]  You were taken and sterilized.
[03:46:39.204 --> 03:46:40.426]  Hundreds of thousands a year.
[03:46:40.426 --> 03:46:41.687]  That's all mainstream news.
[03:46:41.687 --> 03:46:44.290]  I have the newsreels announcing how good it is.
[03:46:44.290 --> 03:46:49.437]  The government-paid-for newsreels are in my film saying how great it is, endgame, that this is U.S.
[03:46:49.437 --> 03:46:50.157]  government.
[03:46:50.157 --> 03:46:54.202]  Before the movies, and before they had TV, they would show newscasts.
[03:46:54.202 --> 03:46:56.085]  Before the movies, it's in here, how they're killing you.
[03:46:57.722 --> 03:47:03.924]  And then Hitler went a little too quick and it kind of freaked people out when they saw all the piles of dead bodies.
[03:47:03.924 --> 03:47:15.968]  And so Julian Huxley and Bertrand Russell and the King of England and others all met and said, we've got to figure out a way to sell people on doing this where they like it.
[03:47:15.968 --> 03:47:19.549]  And they said, well, Mr. Rockefeller has the plan of environmentalism.
[03:47:19.549 --> 03:47:24.671]  We'll teach them humans are bad, teach them we're overpopulated, teach them we're all going to die if we don't do this.
[03:47:26.155 --> 03:47:32.483]  Now they have all the dramas and TV shows and dystopic science fiction movies where they tell you this.
[03:47:32.483 --> 03:47:39.632]  And so they take your survival instinct and turn it against itself and say we've got to get rid of humans or we're all going to die.
[03:47:40.765 --> 03:47:48.869]  And they have these situational ethics games, like Survivor on TV, but that's a bigger model of Lifeboat or Spaceship.
[03:47:48.869 --> 03:47:54.071]  It's a game that public schools nationwide teach in the 5th, 6th, and 7th grade.
[03:47:54.071 --> 03:47:56.972]  I was indoctrinated in government programming myself.
[03:47:56.972 --> 03:48:04.296]  And they say there's a lifeboat, it's a federal grant, and there's only enough food for 5 people but there's 10, and so we're going to have to vote on who dies.
[03:48:04.696 --> 03:48:14.984]  So they don't teach you to get outside the box, figure out how to survive, put up a plastic sail to collect rainwater, uh, or, you know, things like that.
[03:48:14.984 --> 03:48:18.427]  They just teach you somebody's gonna have to die.
[03:48:18.427 --> 03:48:22.130]  So it teaches you to think through solutions by killing fellow humans.
[03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:33.318]  And then in the game, they go, we need a social worker, we need a doctor, we need a bureaucrat, but, uh, they're taught that the artist dies, and the anti-social person dies, and, uh,
[03:48:35.317 --> 03:48:44.088]  And then sometime in the class, they teach this in university as well, someone resists being killed and then they have someone who plays the part of a policeman who kills you.
[03:48:44.088 --> 03:48:46.711]  So your children are being simulated to murder you.
[03:48:46.711 --> 03:48:49.295]  And we're being simulated to take our old people and get rid of them.
[03:48:49.295 --> 03:48:52.759]  It's all murder, death, kill, basic programming.
[03:48:52.759 --> 03:48:53.560]  Hope you enjoy it.
[03:48:54.790 --> 03:49:09.773]  They now have more hardcore Soviet re-education camp, where every major public school in the country I've seen, in elementary school, normally 4th grade, 3rd to 4th grade, they run in with police in camos saying, I'm homeschoolers for the Second Amendment, here to kill you, that's AP, don't believe me?
[03:49:09.773 --> 03:49:22.395]  And they scream, we're homeschoolers and we're going to murder you, and then the parents always freak out because they're not told, the kids aren't told it's real, they defecate on themselves, go into catatonic states, are brain damaged and mentally ill for decades afterwards in many cases.
[03:49:23.581 --> 03:49:30.245]  And the federal grant is to create a psychotic break and to basically create a psychosis and make the children mentally ill.
[03:49:30.245 --> 03:49:38.671]  So that's a hardcore Soviet re-education camp, similar to type programming that the North Koreans would engage in.
[03:49:38.671 --> 03:49:42.453]  Again, it's all just incredibly hardcore.
[03:49:42.453 --> 03:49:46.796]  And remember, Times of London, Billionaire Club, bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:49:46.796 --> 03:49:46.936]  Now,
[03:49:49.318 --> 03:49:52.179]  Here's Rockefeller and the London Independent yesterday.
[03:49:52.179 --> 03:49:53.299]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:49:53.299 --> 03:49:57.661]  Climate change will cause civilization to collapse.
[03:49:57.661 --> 03:50:05.424]  Well, they are artificially collapsing civilization is what is
[03:50:06.721 --> 03:50:07.281]  Going on.
[03:50:07.281 --> 03:50:10.923]  See, the globalists brag about this, and NPR even brags.
[03:50:10.923 --> 03:50:18.666]  Yeah, you know, the global slowdown is good for the environment because it shuts down our carbon footprint and teaches us to live within our means.
[03:50:18.666 --> 03:50:29.030]  And Al Gore and Prince Philip and Prince Charles all say that, and you can Google the headline, uh, global slowdown or global depression, good for environment, good for carbon footprint.
[03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:32.371]  In fact, let's put that on screen for folks.
[03:50:32.371 --> 03:50:35.393]  And I'm showing you, the guys are finding these in like 20, 30 seconds.
[03:50:35.393 --> 03:50:36.113]  You can do the same thing.
[03:50:37.267 --> 03:50:39.009]  You don't have to believe any of what I'm saying.
[03:50:39.009 --> 03:50:47.256]  So they want to make you totally bankrupt, totally dependent on them, so they can carry out their black-op extermination of you and your family.
[03:50:47.256 --> 03:50:51.661]  So I'll finish up with kind of the overview of this plan when we get back.
[03:50:51.661 --> 03:50:54.583]  Then we've got a guest coming up as well.
[03:50:54.583 --> 03:50:55.544]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:50:55.544 --> 03:50:57.266]  You're under eugenics attack.
[03:50:57.266 --> 03:51:00.409]  You might want to wake up and realize they're putting poison in your water and food to kill you.
[03:51:01.292 --> 03:51:11.381]  If you'd like to quit smoking regularly... Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:51:11.381 --> 03:51:17.387]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:51:17.387 --> 03:51:23.913]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:51:24.477 --> 03:51:27.878]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:51:27.878 --> 03:51:30.319]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[03:51:30.319 --> 03:51:36.921]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[03:51:36.921 --> 03:51:40.442]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[03:51:40.442 --> 03:51:44.303]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[03:51:47.484 --> 03:51:50.647]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[03:51:50.647 --> 03:51:52.849]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:56.513]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[03:51:56.513 --> 03:51:58.275]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[03:52:02.691 --> 03:52:08.735]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.735 --> 03:52:14.620]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.620 --> 03:52:20.764]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.104 --> 03:52:23.065]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.065 --> 03:52:25.525]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.525 --> 03:52:38.709]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.709 --> 03:52:40.390]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.390 --> 03:52:42.250]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.250 --> 03:52:48.492]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.159 --> 03:52:57.434]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.434 --> 03:52:59.017]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.017 --> 03:53:00.199]  The people strike back!
[03:53:02.290 --> 03:53:06.493]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776.
[03:53:06.493 --> 03:53:14.598]  However, few know the importance of September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our Founders.
[03:53:14.598 --> 03:53:21.282]  Unfortunately, over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack, along with our beloved Republic.
[03:53:21.282 --> 03:53:27.926]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.
[03:53:28.386 --> 03:53:39.752]  Today, we have the Constitution Pride Flag to show our support for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, freedom, liberty, and justice for we the people of the United States.
[03:53:39.752 --> 03:53:44.034]  Now available at www.1787flags.com.
[03:53:44.034 --> 03:53:50.558]  Get your very own Constitution Pride Flag today and receive a free pocket Constitution with your order.
[03:53:50.558 --> 03:53:57.061]  www.1787flags.com, the official website of the Constitution Pride Flag.
[03:53:57.301 --> 03:53:58.302]  That's www.1787flags.com.
[03:53:58.302 --> 03:53:59.562]  Life has always been cheap.
[03:53:59.562 --> 03:54:01.964]  There's lots of human beings.
[03:54:01.964 --> 03:54:03.985]  There's lots of slaves.
[03:54:26.442 --> 03:54:28.785]  But now, life isn't just cheap.
[03:54:28.785 --> 03:54:30.387]  It's seen as a negative.
[03:54:30.387 --> 03:54:31.548]  The elite don't want us.
[03:54:31.548 --> 03:54:33.390]  There's too many of us.
[03:54:33.390 --> 03:54:38.396]  We're gobbling up environment and things they want because they're control freaks.
[03:54:38.396 --> 03:54:40.099]  They want us to get out of the way.
[03:54:40.099 --> 03:54:41.040]  They want us to die.
[03:54:47.236 --> 03:54:51.837]  And I say to the elite, how about if you think things are overpopulated, how about you get rid of yourselves first?
[03:54:51.837 --> 03:54:52.938]  How about you go first?
[03:54:52.938 --> 03:54:54.498]  How about you lead by example?
[03:54:54.498 --> 03:54:58.499]  But most of them say, oh no, we have to be guardians of this.
[03:54:58.499 --> 03:55:01.540]  We have to help get rid of the humans that are parasites.
[03:55:01.540 --> 03:55:05.302]  Many of them say we're just parasites, period, and all of us do need to be killed.
[03:55:05.302 --> 03:55:15.885]  And Dr. Eric Bianca at UT, who said kill 90% of us and get standing ovations, showing the majority of scientists at these events that the news is covered supporting, he was in the news saying, yeah,
[03:55:17.085 --> 03:55:20.706]  I know my family's gonna have to die and gonna have to go as well.
[03:55:20.706 --> 03:55:26.168]  And I'm sad about it, but it's for the Earth when the time comes.
[03:55:26.168 --> 03:55:33.670]  And then he's on the official University of Texas website, dressed up in a druid outfit, talking about Lucifer.
[03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:36.311]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[03:55:36.311 --> 03:55:44.333]  Google Dr. Eric Pianca Lucifer, and you'll be on the UT website with him in a druid outfit, when he's not talking about how he wants to kill everybody, he's talking about Lucifer.
[03:55:46.287 --> 03:55:47.447]  Now, here's Fox News.
[03:55:47.447 --> 03:55:50.948]  Upcoming military robot could feed on human dead bodies.
[03:55:50.948 --> 03:55:57.030]  Now, this is what Bill Joy, owner of Sun Microsystems, billionaire, said in 1999.
[03:55:57.030 --> 03:56:02.891]  Or was it the 2000 April issue of Wired Magazine?
[03:56:02.891 --> 03:56:05.052]  Why the future doesn't need us was the article.
[03:56:06.027 --> 03:56:08.230]  And he said, the elite said there's too many of us.
[03:56:08.230 --> 03:56:11.394]  They don't need us anymore for factories or agriculture.
[03:56:11.394 --> 03:56:12.836]  They have robotics.
[03:56:12.836 --> 03:56:17.362]  Soon robotic lines will be repairing robotic manufacturing lines.
[03:56:17.362 --> 03:56:20.767]  The military will convert us to stealth aircraft that are remote controlled.
[03:56:21.547 --> 03:56:32.874]  Uh, and that are AI-controlled, and there'll be factories that service the aircraft that are going to be robotic, and there'll be very limited groups of humans that are needed, and the military is going to convert to robots.
[03:56:32.874 --> 03:56:36.236]  And I've talked to troops ten years ago, they have super-advanced robots.
[03:56:36.236 --> 03:56:39.758]  Not just the swords they've already used to kill people in Iraq.
[03:56:39.758 --> 03:56:41.198]  Well, here's Fox News.
[03:56:41.198 --> 03:56:44.180]  Upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies.
[03:56:44.180 --> 03:56:47.482]  See, the eugenicists are very macabre, very, very sick people.
[03:56:48.701 --> 03:56:54.603]  And Army reports in 68 said they would use humans to fuel their robotic system.
[03:56:54.603 --> 03:56:55.604]  I'm not the one saying this.
[03:56:55.604 --> 03:56:56.664]  I know it's crazy.
[03:56:56.664 --> 03:56:57.765]  I'm not the crazy one.
[03:56:57.765 --> 03:57:00.126]  I'm just reporting Fox News here.
[03:57:00.126 --> 03:57:02.126]  And it says, Robotic Technology, Inc.
[03:57:02.126 --> 03:57:04.127]  I want that group on.
[03:57:04.127 --> 03:57:05.988]  Tell the producer.
[03:57:05.988 --> 03:57:08.449]  Energetically autonomous tactical robot.
[03:57:09.133 --> 03:57:12.215]  See, the elite want hunter-killers, and they've said this.
[03:57:12.215 --> 03:57:13.756]  They're just going to turn loose.
[03:57:34.591 --> 03:57:43.597]  And so when you see a movie like Terminator, I read government documents from the 50s calling their robot drone system Skynet.
[03:57:43.597 --> 03:57:48.201]  I was in a private meeting with Dr. Bob Bowman, Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bowman, who was the former head of Star Wars.
[03:57:49.053 --> 03:58:01.200]  And he talked about the robotic fleet with me but said I can only talk about what had been declassified and what NSA and others and other people involved with Star Wars had accidentally in speeches on C-SPAN let slip up.
[03:58:01.200 --> 03:58:11.926]  But there's an entire robotic drone fleet in orbit that's got DU meteor guns basically.
[03:58:11.926 --> 03:58:15.848]  Meteor well weapons to decapitate the leadership.
[03:58:15.848 --> 03:58:18.250]  The point is everything's going to a robotic fleet.
