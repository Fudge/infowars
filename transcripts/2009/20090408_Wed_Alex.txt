[00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:06.310]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.071]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:09.832]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:11.413]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:12.313]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:17.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:21.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:56.011]  All right, we've got Michael Bagnerik, who was the presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party back in 2004, constitutional scholar, just an amazing mind when it comes to the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Magna Carta.
[00:00:57.398 --> 00:01:04.301]  A lawful system of rule of law versus the Napoleonic system we see being set up by the Global Crime Syndicate right now.
[00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:06.062]  He'll be joining us in the last hour today.
[00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:09.624]  Stuart Rhodes is going to pop in in the third hour.
[00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:11.385]  He started Oath Keepers.
[00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.646]  It's a spinoff from the whole Ron Paul Liberty Committee movement.
[00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:25.852]  He worked in the campaign and thousands and thousands of police and military have gone there and pledged on the site, some publicly, some through pseudonyms, that they will protect and defend the Constitution
[00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.133]  Bill of Rights, and they're going to be having rallies and other events around the country.
[00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.334]  So a big update from him coming up.
[00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:50.419]  Okay, that said, this news story of the individual killing three cops and wounding two others up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Saturday just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:01:52.156 --> 00:02:03.319]  Air America, and we've confirmed this from two different sources, had one of their hosts saying that basically I called for violence and said kill the cops.
[00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.001]  So the libel, the slander, the defamation is entering whole new proportions here.
[00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.622]  Last week I was murdering talk show host and an Israeli agent.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:27.428]  This week, it's not just that I supposedly had a listener who went out and did this, who it turns out didn't like me and attacked me all over the web, and now the newspapers have retracted the fact saying that he got the idea from me.
[00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:29.069]  That doesn't matter, though.
[00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.312]  See, now I'm actually telling people to go out and kill police.
[00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:37.815]  You know, I mean, if I wanted to spend all my time suing people, I could do it.
[00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:39.016]  My gosh!
[00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:41.978]  And it's just forcing me to.
[00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:43.559]  Because, I mean, if I don't,
[00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:48.046]  Punish people for what they're doing.
[00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:49.808]  It'll say, well, it's fair game.
[00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:52.931]  You know, let's just say Alex Jones is a child molester next.
[00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:56.354]  Let's say he killed JFK, killed Lincoln.
[00:02:56.354 --> 00:02:58.896]  Let's say he carried out 9-11.
[00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:01.819]  Let's say Alex Jones shot Reagan.
[00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.984]  Let's say Alex Jones, you know, dumps toxic waste in the rivers.
[00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:10.268]  Alex Jones is the boogeyman who hides under your bed at night.
[00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:17.629]  Now again, this is ridiculous, and it shows how desperate the establishment is, who's lost all credibility.
[00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:24.953]  I mean, they've been saying for decades there's no world government, no new world order, no move to a global currency, and now it's in every newspaper.
[00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:32.918]  But simultaneously, they've chosen me as the poster boy to say, don't be like this nut, it's crazy.
[00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:36.540]  If you talk about the UN existing, basically, you're a cop killer.
[00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:46.924]  So, it's just getting crazier and crazier, and I really thought about this this morning, and I wrote a few notes here, and I want to go over this, but this is to be expected.
[00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:50.426]  We are kicking the New World Order's hind end right now.
[00:03:50.426 --> 00:03:52.106]  Their left-right paradigm is shattered.
[00:03:52.106 --> 00:04:01.672]  They're trying to create new paradigms, new systems, new subgroups, new strata, new constituencies for their baloney, and it is
[00:04:02.873 --> 00:04:03.754]  It is not going to work.
[00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:04.976]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:04:04.976 --> 00:04:11.705]  I've seen mainstream news articles the last week saying I'm a liar, that bird flu vaccines haven't killed people.
[00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:15.169]  We can go pull the articles up, show where they're saying it doesn't exist.
[00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.751]  Here is AFP today.
[00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:19.763]  And Associated Press today.
[00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:23.244]  Health workers on trial for vaccine scam in Poland.
[00:04:23.244 --> 00:04:30.285]  Nine health workers were on trial in northern Poland Monday accused of having tested a vaccine against bird flu on 200 patients without their knowledge.
[00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:34.466]  A court official said, and it goes into all the deaths, the 23 deaths.
[00:04:34.466 --> 00:04:37.407]  I mean, I just read out of the AFP.
[00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:38.927]  But then they say, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:45.569]  Or I link to the Army Times saying they're going to put troops on the streets of America for crowd control.
[00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.209]  And they write articles saying
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.262]  I'm making that up.
[00:04:50.262 --> 00:04:53.324]  I mean, folks, you're going to lose this fight.
[00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:55.105]  Your lying isn't going to work.
[00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:56.206]  I mean, you're not stupid.
[00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:56.807]  You're liars.
[00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.410]  Spring is here.
[00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.371]  Growing season.
[00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:05.573]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:07.274]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:08.255]  Think about it.
[00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:12.358]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:16.101]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:18.003]  The country is running out of food.
[00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:20.825]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.627]  At OrganicaSeed.com,

[00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:07.433]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:12.715]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.823]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.823 --> 00:06:21.784]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.784 --> 00:06:24.246]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:37.432]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.432 --> 00:06:39.113]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.113 --> 00:06:40.474]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:47.872]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:57.722]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.722 --> 00:06:58.904]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.563 --> 00:07:09.269]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:07:25.765 --> 00:07:28.207]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:06.074]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.074 --> 00:08:08.375]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.502 --> 00:08:28.145]  For a long time, we've been saying the next target of stage terror will be North Africa.
[00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:34.968]  Kenya, Somalia, and other areas.
[00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:38.989]  Those surrounding areas, Sudan.
[00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:47.232]  And sure enough, you've got these Somali pirates running around, hijacking, sea-jacking, commandeering,
[00:08:48.303 --> 00:09:01.033]  Freebooting, pirating, all over that area, in some cases a couple hundred miles out, and they're even grabbing, you know, one of the biggest ships in the world.
[00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:10.982]  They grabbed a big Saudi ship a few months ago that is one of the biggest ships in the world, three times the size of the Titanic, filled with oil, worth
[00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:16.301]  I think they said like 900 million dollars or something, conservatively.
[00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:24.164]  So all of this is going on and they've now hijacked a ship with 20 Americans on board.
[00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:30.347]  Somali pirates hijacked a U.S.-flagged, Danish-owned container ship on Wednesday with 20 American crew on board.
[00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:35.669]  The latest of a sharp rise in attacks on the Horn of Africa, nation officials said.
[00:09:35.669 --> 00:09:40.091]  Andrew Maguire, coordinator for the
[00:09:42.307 --> 00:09:58.392]  Mombase-based East African Seafarers Assistance Program told Reuters that the 17,000-ton Alabama had been seized off the Mogadishu far out in the Indian Ocean, but all its crew were believed to be safe.
[00:09:58.392 --> 00:10:00.853]  Well, yeah, they're going to hold them for ransom.
[00:10:00.853 --> 00:10:05.915]  Denmark's AP Moller Masaryk confirmed that the U.S.
[00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:06.375]  flagged
[00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:15.523]  Marzic, Alabama had been attacked by pirates about 500 kilometers or 300 miles off Somalia and had probably been hijacked.
[00:10:15.523 --> 00:10:19.465]  The company said it had 20 American crew on board.
[00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:29.290]  The Marzic, Alabama is owned and operated by Marzic Line Limited, a Norfolk, Virginia-based subsidiary of A.P.
[00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.433]  Mohler Masaryk and the world's biggest container shipper.
[00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:35.462]  And it just goes on, a U.S.
[00:10:35.462 --> 00:10:39.105]  Naval spokeswoman in Bahrain, Lt.
[00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:50.935]  Stephanie Murdoch, said a U.S.-flagged Danish-owned ship reported being attacked by pirates early on Wednesday about 280 miles southeast of Somalia.
[00:11:01.553 --> 00:11:10.341]  Last year, heavily armed Somali pirates hijacked dozens of vessels, took hundreds of sailors hostage, often for weeks, and extracted millions of dollars in ransoms.
[00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:19.368]  And we had a well-known author and a captain who repelled an attack on his ship in the Caribbean.
[00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:20.549]  We had him on a few months ago.
[00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:21.930]  Let's get that captain back on.
[00:11:24.107 --> 00:11:38.671]  He's talking about how he believed pirating doubled last year, he thinks it'll double this year, and only about half the companies that get sea-jacked, that get free-booted, that get pirated, that get taken hostage, report what's going on, so it's probably far worse than that.
[00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:41.051]  Well, there's no doubt it's far worse than what's being said.
[00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:48.333]  So, over the weekend, they also seized a French yacht, a Yemen tug, and a 20,000 ton German container vessel.
[00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.994]  Interfax News Agency said the Hassan
[00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:58.435]  Stavanger had a German captain, three Russians, two Ukrainians, and 14 Filipinos on board.
[00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:10.104]  The pirates typically launch speedboats from other ships, meaning they can sometimes evade warships patrolling the strategic shipping lanes and strike far out to sea.
[00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:21.654]  They then take captured vessels to remote coastal villages based in Somalia, and they have usually targeted their hostages, treated their hostages well, in anticipation of a sizable ransom payment.
[00:12:24.412 --> 00:12:40.690]  Okay, if you go back just 30-40 years ago, small ships, large ships, container ships, you name it, they had semi-automatic weapons, they had grenade launchers, they were tough guys on the ships.
[00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.073]  And companies, you know, had their crew armed.
[00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:59.564]  Because they'd come out of the piracy of the last several thousand years and they knew that the answer is to have a watchman on deck on fire watch watching for pirates or for fires or for anything else or for ships or debris.
[00:12:59.564 --> 00:13:04.507]  You got watchmen out there including those who were at the con who were in control of the ship.
[00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:13.320]  The captain of their designates, and then if somebody comes up alongside the ship without permission and starts trying to get on board, you kill them!
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:29.524]  Now, all these nations, though, the globalists, the control, they want the seas to be lawless so they can bring in the law of the sea treaty they've been trying to pass for forty years that makes the United Nations create its own navy and tax every ship on earth and control all the nation's ports and their inland waterways.
[00:13:29.524 --> 00:13:30.364]  This is on record.
[00:13:30.364 --> 00:13:31.904]  They're trying to ratify it right now.
[00:13:31.904 --> 00:13:34.385]  Been trying for decades in the U.S.
[00:13:35.225 --> 00:13:37.607]  A lot of other countries have ratified it.
[00:13:37.607 --> 00:13:42.430]  And 74% of the Earth's surface is seawater.
[00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.472]  Another 1.5% is freshwater.
[00:13:45.472 --> 00:13:47.153]  And they want total control.
[00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:50.576]  I mean, they already control the Great Lakes under UN treaties, and that's public.
[00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:54.779]  You can just Google that and read mainstream news articles about it.
[00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:56.339]  People raise a big stink over it.
[00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:59.500]  So, they don't allow people to be armed.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:06.381]  And so, of course, the Chinese government's been caught out pirating people's ships and blaming it on other pirates.
[00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:09.102]  They've caught the Indonesian government doing it.
[00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:11.382]  They've caught Latin American countries doing it.
[00:14:11.382 --> 00:14:18.104]  Because, I mean, you don't just think these pirates just come back to port and are just left alone without paying a big fat cut to local corrupt people.
[00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:26.041]  And so, in a lot of nations, after decades of piracy, the local constabulary says, you know what?
[00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:28.744]  We'll just go ahead and fully take this over.
[00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:32.167]  And so, the Japanese have gone public.
[00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:39.575]  They've videoed from other ships, and now they've been having confrontations with the Chinese.
[00:14:39.575 --> 00:14:41.036]  And Chinese ships have been ramming U.S.
[00:14:41.036 --> 00:14:41.577]  naval vessels.
[00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:59.620]  People in Chinese uniform on Chinese government craft, their Coast Guard mainly, out there stealing stuff all over the place just north of Korea and the sea between Japan and China proper.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.364]  So it's just constant robbing, constant stealing, constant thieving going on.
[00:15:06.124 --> 00:15:13.410]  And their answer is, don't, and of course I've had captains and other experts on who've been attacked, successfully defended, because they were armed.
[00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:25.881]  The answer is, instead of having billions of dollars in ransom, and that's now what it is every year, the answer is, legislatively say that the ships are to be armed.
[00:15:27.918 --> 00:15:31.941]  And they could pay to have three or four people on each ship who are specifically armed.
[00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:36.024]  If the sailors want to sign on and go through a little training course, they can be armed as well.
[00:15:36.024 --> 00:15:37.545]  Have the whole crew armed!
[00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:38.706]  These are professionals!
[00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:54.478]  They navigate gigantic ships through channels carrying, you know, poisonous gases, explosive gases, ammonium, sulfur, cyanide gas, sulfur,
[00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:57.371]  Just all this explosive stuff.
[00:15:57.371 --> 00:15:59.492]  Fertilizer.
[00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:00.552]  The list goes on and on.
[00:16:00.552 --> 00:16:05.853]  In all your major cities, you've got these ships, big and small, coming in.
[00:16:05.853 --> 00:16:18.776]  Much more dangerous per capita than the jet airliners with those professionals up there flying who they fight tooth and nail to not allow them to be armed.
[00:16:18.776 --> 00:16:24.777]  So, you arm the professionals, you arm the pilots, you arm the captains, you arm... and the companies can all decide how they want to do it.
[00:16:26.226 --> 00:16:27.508]  And then you arm them.
[00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:31.814]  And let me tell you, these Somalis will back off real fast.
[00:16:31.814 --> 00:16:33.917]  The Chinese will back off real fast.
[00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:36.400]  And when they pull up to attack a boat, people open up on them.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.804]  You know, you loudspeaker them, get away from our boat.
[00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:47.245]  Just amazing.
[00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:56.552]  In fact, they already, there are a lot of nations, like the Israelis, who do allow everybody to be armed on the ships, so you never see them being jacked.
[00:16:56.552 --> 00:17:06.539]  You never see them being pirated, because they see Israeli ships, Israeli flags, they run in fear.
[00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:07.980]  They run in fear.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:15.306]  But oh, they know the countries, like the United States and Saudi Arabia and others, who don't allow the people on board their ships to be armed.
[00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.001]  And they just love it.
[00:17:20.001 --> 00:17:21.883]  Look, we're a big fat target.
[00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:24.325]  When you're disarmed, you're a big fat target.
[00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:25.425]  It is very simple.
[00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:27.187]  A lot of people love to attack and mug women.
[00:17:27.187 --> 00:17:28.708]  You know, not just rape them.
[00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:30.649]  A mugger's choice is a woman with a purse.
[00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:31.070]  Why?
[00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.733]  Because on average, a woman isn't going to snatch a handgun out of that purse and blow you away like a man is.
[00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:39.917]  I mean, do you see people mugging people with fanny packs?
[00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:41.658]  No, because they know.
[00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:44.180]  That person's got a firearm that's going to kill me deader than a hammer.
[00:17:46.038 --> 00:18:01.143]  That's why in Florida and Texas and every other state, 30 plus states, within two years, you can pull up the federal numbers on this, within two years of having a concealed carry, violent crime rates drop, on average, by 24%.
[00:18:01.143 --> 00:18:06.964]  Carjackings end, for all intents and purposes.
[00:18:06.964 --> 00:18:10.105]  I mean, around here in Texas, the thieves are scared to death, folks.
[00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:11.626]  That's why they mug old ladies and women.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:21.962]  And more and more they're figuring out women are packing.
[00:18:21.962 --> 00:18:26.483]  I mean, somebody came around here trying to rob somebody or trying to shoot somebody.
[00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:31.264]  There's multiple people in this office with concealed carry permits, they're just going to open up on you.
[00:18:31.264 --> 00:18:36.246]  One foot from you, I got a .357 Magnum right here.
[00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:37.286]  More guns, less crime.
[00:18:42.574 --> 00:18:48.598]  And this is our heritage of liberty and freedom, but oh, there you have it, don't let the ships get weapons.
[00:18:48.598 --> 00:18:57.543]  So now, everybody's disarmed, they're being pirated, they're being robbed, they're easy pickings out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:18:57.543 --> 00:19:02.586]  People are disappearing every couple of weeks in the Gulf of Mexico, right off Texas.
[00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:03.727]  Right off Texas, folks.
[00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:06.669]  People are ten miles out with their families, fishing.
[00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:07.890]  They're gone, never seen again.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:17.124]  Pirates pull up, shoot everybody in the head, tie weights to them, throw them into the Gulf of Mexico, and drive off in their $100,000 boat.
[00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:24.968]  They're killing people for $100,000 boats right off the coast of Port Aransas.
[00:19:24.968 --> 00:19:31.932]  They're killing people right off the coast of Houston and Rockport and Galveston.
[00:19:31.932 --> 00:19:34.213]  They're killing them.
[00:19:34.213 --> 00:19:35.494]  They're killing them all the time.
[00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:45.005]  Oh, but God forbid the families carry a handgun out there or a rifle, because the Coast Guard will pull up and take you to jail!
[00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:53.789]  That's right, you're going to sit out here and you're going to let pirates from the United States and pirates from Mexico rob the daylights out of you.
[00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:57.011]  God forbid you be in the Gulf in some million dollar yacht.
[00:19:57.011 --> 00:19:57.812]  You're asking for it.
[00:19:57.812 --> 00:20:00.513]  You better have a security detail.
[00:20:00.513 --> 00:20:06.356]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[00:20:08.046 --> 00:20:08.506]  We're good to go.
[00:20:25.342 --> 00:20:26.062]  We're good to go.
[00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:46.671]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.272 --> 00:21:05.655]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:07.436]  Genetically modifying.
[00:21:07.436 --> 00:21:13.859]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:19.603]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.603 --> 00:21:21.784]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.784 --> 00:21:22.565]  Surrender.
[00:21:22.565 --> 00:21:26.367]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:21:26.367 --> 00:21:27.267]  What then?
[00:21:29.964 --> 00:21:33.045]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:37.366]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:40.246]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:06.675]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.675 --> 00:22:13.708]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.238 --> 00:22:20.821]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:22.801]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:25.302]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:36.887]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.887 --> 00:22:38.547]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.547 --> 00:22:39.908]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:47.324]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:55.570]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.151]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:58.332]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.054 --> 00:23:01.835]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:03.515]  April 8, 2009.
[00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:05.636]  Gold opened this morning at $88,360.
[00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:09.018]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $909.43, $454.72 for a half-ounce, and $227.36 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:23:09.018 --> 00:23:09.498]  That's $909.43, $454.72, or $227.36.
[00:23:18.078 --> 00:23:30.381]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:23:30.381 --> 00:23:33.562]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:23:33.562 --> 00:23:36.902]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:23:36.902 --> 00:23:39.723]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:23:39.923 --> 00:23:42.085]  All right, I just spent a whole segment on the pirates.
[00:24:09.795 --> 00:24:11.656]  Hijacking ship with 20 Americans on board.
[00:24:11.656 --> 00:24:12.976]  Off the coast of Somalia.
[00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:17.678]  And I said I was going to really get into, because this isn't about Alex Jones, this isn't about how
[00:24:34.051 --> 00:24:46.495]  Air America and reportedly TV hosts now and all these publications, Alternet today, coming right out and saying basically it's my fault those three cops got killed.
[00:24:46.495 --> 00:24:49.897]  I mean it is asinine, it is ridiculous.
[00:24:49.897 --> 00:25:02.561]  Even if that guy was a big fan of the show and agreed with me, which by the way he wrote all these posts attacking me and didn't agree with me, and the media knew that and lied, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has done two articles retracting saying he actually didn't like me and was critical of me.
[00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.659]  But they don't care.
[00:25:05.659 --> 00:25:08.160]  The New York Times doesn't care.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.241]  All these publications don't care.
[00:25:12.241 --> 00:25:15.542]  Because they're attacking the First Amendment.
[00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:19.063]  More than they're even attacking the Second Amendment.
[00:25:19.063 --> 00:25:23.304]  And they're coming after all your rights.
[00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:29.106]  Because I sit here and I cover the scary things, the criminal things, the corrupt, out-of-control government's doing.
[00:25:29.106 --> 00:25:30.786]  I mean, you can say it's not out of control.
[00:25:30.786 --> 00:25:32.487]  Congress still has a 9% approval rating.
[00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:40.191]  Obama's is plunging like a shooting star coming into orbit.
[00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:45.774]  And the liberals, the establishment liberals, really hate me.
[00:25:45.774 --> 00:25:50.017]  Because I'm calling them on their bluff.
[00:25:50.017 --> 00:25:52.419]  I'm calling them on their bluff.
[00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:56.742]  You know, we were there exposing Clinton when he was a puppet of the globalists carrying out corruption.
[00:25:56.742 --> 00:25:59.824]  We were called right-wing fascist, Nazi, racist.
[00:25:59.824 --> 00:26:01.085]  With no evidence, just made up.
[00:26:04.178 --> 00:26:10.099]  Then I was called a hardcore communist funded by George Soros when I was attacking George Bush.
[00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:13.660]  Totally made up absolute bull.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:22.682]  Now I am going after Obama as a puppet saying, can we just get past the puppet please to the bankers that have stolen $12.8 trillion?
[00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:32.604]  And the establishment is saying, no Alex, you're a evil right-wing racist fascist cop killer.
[00:26:35.495 --> 00:26:43.859]  And world government doesn't exist, and Obama isn't calling for more gun control, and you're a liar.
[00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:45.239]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:50.762]  Because as long as they can keep us arguing about left and right all day long.
[00:26:50.762 --> 00:26:53.783]  Look, you criticize the government, whoever's in power.
[00:26:53.783 --> 00:26:56.544]  If it's a Republican, they're going to call you a commie.
[00:26:56.544 --> 00:26:59.865]  If it's a Democrat, they're going to call you a fascist.
[00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:03.007]  When it's the same policies, and you Democrats are pathetic!
[00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:05.137]  Not all of you.
[00:27:05.137 --> 00:27:14.221]  A lot of big ones, including Bob Dylan and a bunch of other, a bunch of top liberal writers who do have a soul, are coming out and saying, my God, Obama's bad.
[00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.641]  You know, he writes for the Huffington Post.
[00:27:15.641 --> 00:27:18.142]  Max Keiser said he'd hoped Obama would be better.
[00:27:18.142 --> 00:27:21.644]  I mean, it should be easy to be better than Bush, and he says he's worse!
[00:27:21.644 --> 00:27:23.004]  He said here two days ago.
[00:27:23.004 --> 00:27:25.065]  That's a guy with a BBC TV show.
[00:27:25.065 --> 00:27:26.926]  That's a guy with a syndicated radio show.
[00:27:26.926 --> 00:27:29.927]  That's a guy who writes for one of the biggest columns out there.
[00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:33.589]  And he's risking all he's got to tell the truth.
[00:27:33.589 --> 00:27:36.351]  Because let me tell you, he's committing heresy.
[00:27:36.351 --> 00:27:41.434]  But I mean, how can you not go, the king has no clothes, the emperor has no clothes, he's butt naked.
[00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:52.162]  I mean, he's expanding the secrecy, expanding the warrantless wiretapping, taking over the whole internet publicly, the technologies czar he appointed resigns and says, I can't be part of this.
[00:27:52.162 --> 00:27:55.285]  It almost gets no attention.
[00:27:55.285 --> 00:27:57.787]  He's got nothing but criminal bankers running everything.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.662]  And then the left, I mean, I'm being directly attacked by George Soros right now.
[00:28:03.662 --> 00:28:08.204]  You know that's who runs Media Matters.
[00:28:08.204 --> 00:28:11.926]  Literally runs it.
[00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:15.988]  And all these other big sites that he publicly funds are attacking me.
[00:28:15.988 --> 00:28:20.890]  Let me tell you something, folks, it's creepy to have the eye of Soron on you.
[00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.732]  I mean, you think it's fun having hardcore people like George Soros after you?
[00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:34.346]  And having the distinct pleasure of having fake conservatives controlled by that brand of Kool-Aid.
[00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:37.189]  You got the cherry Kool-Aid that's the Republican stuff with cyanide.
[00:28:37.189 --> 00:28:42.573]  You got the grape that's the Democrat flavor or orange or whatever you want to call it.
[00:28:42.573 --> 00:28:44.875]  And I'm not drinking either one of them.
[00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:45.816]  You got me, Jack?
[00:28:45.816 --> 00:28:53.162]  And you want to call me crazy because I'm not going to drink either one of your Kool-Aids.
[00:28:53.162 --> 00:28:55.564]  And I have tried and tried and tried.
[00:28:56.636 --> 00:28:57.596]  To not be the leader.
[00:28:57.596 --> 00:29:01.478]  I have tried to not be the poster boy for a lot of reasons.
[00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:05.979]  Number one, it makes us weaker to have it focused on a leader.
[00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:10.561]  It needs to be an idea, a manifesto, a bill of rights, a constitution, a declaration of independence.
[00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:15.323]  Something that's in stone that all people can be leaders in.
[00:29:15.323 --> 00:29:19.764]  Because then they can't, then if they try to target the idea of themselves, they look stupid.
[00:29:19.764 --> 00:29:22.465]  And you're attacking free speech, you're attacking self-defense.
[00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:23.706]  But see, they can make it all about me,
[00:29:26.377 --> 00:29:27.597]  They can be somewhat successful.
[00:29:27.597 --> 00:29:30.118]  Now, in the process, it makes me huge!
[00:29:30.118 --> 00:29:31.658]  And I've always known that's the path.
[00:29:31.658 --> 00:29:36.259]  See, I've been holding back being explosively huge.
[00:29:36.259 --> 00:29:39.540]  And I realize now I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.761]  And now I have to face my fear, because that's the final fear.
[00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:46.121]  I now enter the phase of maximum danger.
[00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:48.362]  A lot of you wanting to see them crush me?
[00:29:48.362 --> 00:29:51.122]  You're probably going to get to see it now.
[00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.523]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.523 --> 00:29:54.023]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.035 --> 00:30:02.017]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:07.538]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[00:30:07.538 --> 00:30:10.559]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:15.940]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[00:30:16.756 --> 00:30:20.419]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:21.700]  We have been warned.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:28.006]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[00:30:28.006 --> 00:30:28.706]  Too late.
[00:30:28.706 --> 00:30:31.929]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[00:30:31.929 --> 00:30:32.370]  Why?
[00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.353]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[00:30:36.353 --> 00:30:37.474]  Supplies are running low.
[00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:44.395]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[00:30:44.395 --> 00:30:48.318]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:50.780]  Go to YourFoodStorage.com.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.262]  That's YourFoodStorage.com.
[00:30:53.262 --> 00:30:56.264]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[00:30:56.264 --> 00:31:00.308]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[00:31:00.308 --> 00:31:06.933]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.689 --> 00:31:13.571]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:20.073]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.073 --> 00:31:22.054]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.054 --> 00:31:24.514]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.514 --> 00:31:35.418]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:39.353]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.353 --> 00:31:41.215]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.215 --> 00:31:48.142]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.142 --> 00:31:56.411]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.411 --> 00:31:57.972]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.972 --> 00:31:59.154]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.856 --> 00:32:02.157]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.157 --> 00:32:07.739]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:12.761]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:18.343]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:18.343 --> 00:32:23.565]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:23.565 --> 00:32:25.426]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:30.675]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:30.675 --> 00:32:31.796]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:34.578]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:38.481]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:41.683]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:43.905]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:44.846]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:44.846 --> 00:32:45.246]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:46.147]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:32:54.983 --> 00:32:57.524]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:57.524 --> 00:32:59.904]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[00:33:23.647 --> 00:33:28.051]  Glenn Beck did a part two on how none of the FEMA camps exist.
[00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:28.891]  Last night.
[00:33:28.891 --> 00:33:29.652]  More of the same.
[00:33:29.652 --> 00:33:31.473]  Strawman.
[00:33:31.473 --> 00:33:34.455]  Exactly as I predicted three weeks ago.
[00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:37.217]  He went to exactly the things I knew they would go to.
[00:33:37.217 --> 00:33:39.319]  The fake stuff on the web.
[00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:41.421]  The strawman, you know.
[00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:52.209]  That'd be like saying there's no fish in the sea because you went to a certain little spot and stuck a little periscope down and showed there were no fish swimming around right there.
[00:33:54.011 --> 00:33:57.392]  I mean, that's what the straw man argument does.
[00:33:57.392 --> 00:34:22.903]  And they do it over and over and over again, but I did the big hour and forty minute presentation on Monday ahead of his, predicted what he was going to do accurately again, down to the very story, and then showed all the documents, video clips, Congress admitting it, congressional testimonies, Houston Chronicle, Wall Street Journal,
[00:34:25.242 --> 00:34:30.227]  New York Times showed it all, and discredited you.
[00:34:30.227 --> 00:34:35.231]  So that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the story debunking Glenn Beck.
[00:34:35.231 --> 00:34:41.937]  We hope you get the YouTube videos that were ripped from PrisonPlanet.tv during the live show, and make sure that goes viral, folks.
[00:34:41.937 --> 00:34:51.105]  Send that out to all the Glenn Beck forums, all the Glenn Beck 9-12 minion groups, burn it to disk, go to their events, go, look, here's all the documents and video clips of the camps.
[00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.917]  And I think we should also mail them to Glenn Beck.
[00:34:54.917 --> 00:35:05.482]  You should physically mail hundreds of copies and links to the YouTube videos to Glenn Beck and say, hey buddy, here it is, you being debunked.
[00:35:05.482 --> 00:35:06.902]  Okay, I'm done talking about that later.
[00:35:06.902 --> 00:35:08.243]  I'm gonna debunk his part two.
[00:35:08.243 --> 00:35:10.884]  We've already debunked part one yesterday.
[00:35:10.884 --> 00:35:16.306]  All right.
[00:35:16.306 --> 00:35:18.167]  Let me just take my time
[00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:26.949]  On this right now, and then we're gonna open the phones up next hour on the economy and a bunch of other important issues we've got.
[00:35:26.949 --> 00:35:31.251]  And how these secret vaccine trials of bird flu vaccine are killing a bunch of people.
[00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:32.931]  It's now on mainstream news.
[00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:35.472]  People are being arrested over it, but it's being kept quiet.
[00:35:35.472 --> 00:35:37.993]  It's on the news wires, but it's being kept quiet.
[00:35:37.993 --> 00:35:44.235]  They gotta keep it quiet, because if it ever goes on mainstream TV, controlled news sites can't say I'm making it up.
[00:35:44.235 --> 00:35:49.097]  So they have to make sure the cattle, as they call them, haven't heard any of this.
[00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:55.279]  So they can say I'm a liar and then people believe it.
[00:35:55.279 --> 00:36:01.622]  I got another report here, San Marcos, Texas, where they're on the news saying you've got to take your vaccines or you'll be arrested.
[00:36:01.622 --> 00:36:03.682]  It's the law when there is no law to take the vaccines.
[00:36:03.682 --> 00:36:09.805]  I mean, there's just no end to the criminal lying that goes on.
[00:36:09.805 --> 00:36:13.026]  And it's the scope of the lies is the reason I get away with so much of it.
[00:36:13.026 --> 00:36:16.307]  But let me address this now.
[00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:18.528]  Then we'll open the phones up about that and a host of issues.
[00:36:22.554 --> 00:36:27.256]  And there's so many different angles to all of this, but let me just go through them.
[00:36:27.256 --> 00:36:37.380]  Number one, every time there's a mass shooting or a bombing, the government tries to link it to its political opposition.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.362]  And how can you tell who the real opposition to the New World Order is?
[00:36:40.362 --> 00:36:50.146]  That is global private banks setting up world government through a regulatory system, setting tax rates on a planetary scale, interest rates, and currency rates.
[00:36:51.667 --> 00:37:00.249]  What's been openly announced, there's no more denying world government, it's literally in thousands of news articles, world leaders openly announcing a global government.
[00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:02.410]  How do you know what their real opposition is?
[00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:09.271]  It's the patriots, it's the libertarians, it's the freedom lovers, it's people that want smaller government and don't want to be under an empire.
[00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:12.712]  It's anti-globalist on the left, if you want to use the false paradigm.
[00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:18.836]  And so, what do you see the government always attacking, always criticizing?
[00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:28.258]  You know, last year when they had the Violent Radicalization Act hearings in Congress, they showed 9-11 truth right next to Al-Qaeda and said, this is a terrorist group and we've got to shut down their free speech.
[00:37:28.258 --> 00:37:38.620]  Because they know if the public finds out that elements of the government are staging terror attacks, and find out it's in government manuals and declassified documents, and it's been done hundreds of times, the jig is up.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.801]  They could be brought to justice.
[00:37:39.801 --> 00:37:41.381]  This is dangerous for the establishment.
[00:37:44.147 --> 00:37:54.553]  And the left gatekeep attacked us and tried to shut us down and protected Bush's flank all through his eight years of his administration.
[00:37:54.553 --> 00:38:01.678]  But now that we're going after Barack Obama as a front man and as a puppet, and make no mistake, he's going to stage big terror attacks.
[00:38:01.678 --> 00:38:03.379]  We've analyzed their whole program.
[00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:10.043]  They're not going to be able to get their operation through without having some staged terror to get the American people all scared
[00:38:11.192 --> 00:38:26.157]  And to get the American people to all rally around government, and well, they may be robbing us blind, but at least they're keeping me safe from whoever nuked Chicago, or whoever dirty bombed Dallas, or whoever went into that shopping mall in Austin, Texas and gunned everybody down.
[00:38:26.157 --> 00:38:30.638]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, they're going to do it!
[00:38:30.638 --> 00:38:36.600]  Just like I told you 9-11, and I said they'll probably attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their CIA asset Osama Bin Laden.
[00:38:38.097 --> 00:38:48.944]  Because we knew the Feds had cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, and ran the whole operation, according to the New York Times even, in 1993 at the World Trade Center.
[00:38:48.944 --> 00:38:51.985]  They literally went and pulled off Waco as a distraction.
[00:38:51.985 --> 00:38:55.548]  The memos came out on that.
[00:38:55.548 --> 00:39:01.111]  And then as a distraction over Waco, they carried out Oklahoma City.
[00:39:01.111 --> 00:39:02.512]  So let's just talk Turkey here.
[00:39:04.414 --> 00:39:18.004]  Let's just talk reality here for people like Max Blumenthal at Alternet, with their hundreds of thousands of readers, basically coming out and saying, I had the cops killed.
[00:39:18.004 --> 00:39:20.946]  Pretty amazing stuff.
[00:39:20.946 --> 00:39:23.949]  Let me tell you something, punk.
[00:39:23.949 --> 00:39:25.810]  This is the real world.
[00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:26.451]  This isn't your
[00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:33.974]  Candy-ass planet of fake liberal sophistry and propaganda.
[00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:35.894]  Do you understand me?
[00:39:35.894 --> 00:39:42.217]  I'm risking my life, and my name, and my treasure, and my blood, sweat, and tears for you.
[00:39:42.217 --> 00:39:43.578]  I'm right about the New World Order.
[00:39:43.578 --> 00:39:44.778]  I know they're eugenicists.
[00:39:44.778 --> 00:39:46.799]  I know they funded Hitler, and Stalin, and Mao.
[00:39:46.799 --> 00:39:48.920]  It's on record.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:55.343]  David Rockefeller wrote op-ed pieces in the New York Times bragging about it, funding Mao, who killed 60-plus million people.
[00:39:55.343 --> 00:39:56.844]  This isn't a joke.
[00:39:58.123 --> 00:40:02.985]  And don't be like the fools who supported Lennon early on, who ended up in deep trouble.
[00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:03.665]  Do you understand?
[00:40:03.665 --> 00:40:10.687]  People like you are going to be the first targets of this thing once it takes over.
[00:40:10.687 --> 00:40:18.369]  This is life and death, son.
[00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:27.012]  And I'm not going to be sucked in to the New York Times, or Raw Story, or Daily Kosh, or the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
[00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:40.224]  Or George Soros' Media Matters, I'm not going to be sucked into any of your left-right paradigm when you call me a hardcore, super right-wing, fascist, racist.
[00:40:40.224 --> 00:40:43.767]  I am not going to be sucked into that libel, that slander, that defamation.
[00:40:43.767 --> 00:40:48.191]  Everybody who knows who I am knows that's a crock.
[00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:50.153]  And knows you're instantly discredited.
[00:40:50.153 --> 00:40:52.075]  But you're discredited at your base.
[00:40:55.788 --> 00:41:01.491]  Because you, for decades, have told everybody there's no new world order.
[00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:02.371]  And you went further.
[00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:07.754]  You said, these crazies say it's going to be run by a private group of banks and we're going to have a global
[00:41:08.942 --> 00:41:25.397]  Currency tax, a wire transfer tax, Tobin tax, it was openly proposed, that's why we're right, we just read what they said they were going to do, introduced in the UN, a tax on all carbon to control everybody, and that they would implode the economy through derivatives to bring this in.
[00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:32.442]  I've been saying that for 10 plus years, because I was reading what George Soros was saying they were going to do.
[00:41:32.442 --> 00:41:34.563]  I was reading what David Rockefeller said they were going to do.
[00:41:34.563 --> 00:41:37.345]  I was reading IMF and World Bank documents.
[00:41:37.345 --> 00:41:44.411]  I was interviewing other economists and people that were aware of it, like George Humphrey, who wrote a book, Common Sense.
[00:41:44.411 --> 00:41:45.712]  And then he wrote Uncommon Sense.
[00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:59.407]  It's laying out ten years ago, we sell the audiobooks and the pamphlets to this day at Infowars.com, laying out exactly what has now happened.
[00:41:59.407 --> 00:42:00.909]  He actually wrote Common Sense.
[00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:09.022]  In 97, or was it 98, and he wrote Uncommon Sense, I think, in 99, but the point is, so that's more than 10 years ago for the first one.
[00:42:09.022 --> 00:42:20.653]  The point is, we're on record, and people listen, and they remember, and they see our books and videos on record, and they know we told the truth, and they know we were accurate, and they know we pegged it exactly, precisely.
[00:42:20.653 --> 00:42:24.737]  See, the public wouldn't go to the library in the 90s, because most of this wasn't on the web then.
[00:42:25.177 --> 00:42:36.767]  And they would just hear me on the radio and say, oh, that guy's a liar, when I'd read a biological diversity assessment by the UN, 1996, saying they want world government to carry out the orderly culling of 80% of us.
[00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:41.171]  Now they can go directly to mainstream websites and read the scans, or go to the UN's own site and read it.
[00:42:43.777 --> 00:42:47.179]  So, they heard us say all this wild stuff, and I agree, it's crazy.
[00:42:47.179 --> 00:42:48.160]  Who could believe this?
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.140]  But it's real.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.321]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:42:50.321 --> 00:42:52.882]  And so all these years you said it didn't exist.
[00:42:52.882 --> 00:42:54.863]  All these years you said it wasn't happening.
[00:42:54.863 --> 00:43:04.549]  I mean, I remember Limbaugh saying, both the left and right, owned by the same people, saying none of this existed, none of this was happening, none of this was going on, none of this was real.
[00:43:07.105 --> 00:43:09.906]  And you said it over and over again, all of you.
[00:43:09.906 --> 00:43:26.350]  It was so much fun to say, oh, there's no global elite, there's no corrupt group of corporations trying to do hostile takeovers of nations, oh, those are just crazy people, and oh, tell me about the Martians next.
[00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:33.791]  And the media tended to always, in TV shows and things, to sandwich in UFOs and Chupacabras in with the serious issues, thinking that would work.
[00:43:33.791 --> 00:43:35.812]  No, that didn't work, that discredited you even faster.
[00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:43.480]  And people differentiated the fun fantasy stuff with the reality.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.503]  Comprende?
[00:43:47.503 --> 00:43:54.509]  And so people found out the truth and you guys arrogantly thought you could handle it all and could deal with it all with all your spin doctors.
[00:43:56.178 --> 00:43:59.239]  And so now you're... this is them grabbing at straws.
[00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:06.262]  Oh, some white supremacist, out-of-work guy, whose dogs are urinating all over mommy's rug.
[00:44:06.262 --> 00:44:08.183]  She tells him, get out, so he throws a fit.
[00:44:08.183 --> 00:44:09.964]  The cops show up in minutes, he guns them down.
[00:44:11.365 --> 00:44:20.210]  The police feed, and the FBI feeds, their operatives at the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, all the guy's handles.
[00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:26.173]  They feed them all the sites where he's commented, and they come out and say, oh, he was a fan of Alex Jones.
[00:44:26.173 --> 00:44:29.875]  I remember talking to the reporter, and I said, oh.
[00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:31.255]  He said, yeah, I've been reading his comments.
[00:44:31.255 --> 00:44:31.916]  I went, oh, really?
[00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:32.996]  I said, what's his handle?
[00:44:32.996 --> 00:44:34.197]  Oh, I don't really want to get into that, you know.
[00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:41.481]  But the point is, is that he said, oh, he didn't really agree with you, but I said, oh, he didn't put that in the article.
[00:44:41.481 --> 00:44:42.182]  I said, how do you know that?
[00:44:42.182 --> 00:44:43.945]  Oh, I just read some of his posts.
[00:44:43.945 --> 00:44:48.994]  And then we finally learn he's posting on my site, and the guy's attacking me and attacking me on other sites.
[00:44:50.379 --> 00:44:57.022]  And they knew that all along, and the FBI fed that to the ADL, which they admit they work with.
[00:44:57.022 --> 00:45:03.265]  The ADL has an office at YouTube, has an office at the FBI, has an office at the BATF.
[00:45:03.265 --> 00:45:08.448]  They fed that out into the media about me, and now folks have found out about it.
[00:45:08.448 --> 00:45:14.051]  They found out about how that was planted in the media to go after who's the big threat.
[00:45:14.051 --> 00:45:14.851]  It's me!
[00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:16.472]  Because I'm telling the truth.
[00:45:18.584 --> 00:45:22.706]  And we have radically shifted the paradigms so much.
[00:45:22.706 --> 00:45:26.369]  The headline should have been, White Supremacists Didn't Like Alex Jones.
[00:45:26.369 --> 00:45:29.751]  See, it wasn't.
[00:45:29.751 --> 00:45:33.393]  They are so desperate because all of this is coming out, we have shifted the paradigm.
[00:45:33.393 --> 00:45:40.257]  All these years, I mean, I've made films that have conservatively been watched on the internet, in-game,
[00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:50.357]  Endgame has been conservatively watched on the internet more than 50 million times that we can go around different sites and count up.
[00:45:50.357 --> 00:45:53.700]  The Obama deception, hundreds of versions of it on the web.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.183]  I've spent hours going over how many times it's been watched.
[00:45:56.183 --> 00:45:58.245]  Within two weeks it's been watched more than 15 million times.
[00:46:01.894 --> 00:46:14.238]  You think the establishment likes the fact I can make a film that costs $100,000, and then I release it free, and in two weeks it's been seen more than 15 million times, it's now three plus weeks I haven't gone and counted it up yet.
[00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:18.179]  Takes hours to go around to hundreds of sites and count it up.
[00:46:18.179 --> 00:46:19.860]  You think they like that?
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:28.803]  You think George Soros, who spent his own hard-earned money to put Barack Obama in to pacify the left, that's all that is is a co-opting the left, you think he likes that?
[00:46:29.841 --> 00:46:34.682]  You understand the zone I've stepped into, the level we've gone to?
[00:46:34.682 --> 00:46:42.444]  And see, I always wanted to have hundreds and hundreds of big leaders, because number one, listen to me carefully, that is the hardest thing to defeat.
[00:46:42.444 --> 00:46:45.865]  Because if it's about an idea, that's bulletproof.
[00:46:45.865 --> 00:46:47.445]  An idea is invincible.
[00:46:47.445 --> 00:46:48.825]  An idea can't be stopped.
[00:46:48.825 --> 00:46:51.906]  They can't say, oh, the First Amendment killed
[00:46:53.735 --> 00:46:54.735]  Those three cops.
[00:46:54.735 --> 00:46:55.796]  Or the Second Amendment did it.
[00:46:55.796 --> 00:46:57.476]  Then people defend that right, and it doesn't work.
[00:46:57.476 --> 00:47:01.737]  But they say, oh, the crazy guy Alex Jones, he did it.
[00:47:01.737 --> 00:47:10.759]  They can make it all about me, and then manufacture things about me, or find real flaws I have, and blow them up to gargantuan proportions.
[00:47:10.759 --> 00:47:14.020]  Then they can plant drugs on me, or they can set me up, or they can kill me!
[00:47:16.658 --> 00:47:19.420]  And then, oh, look, they've discredited an idea in a movement.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:26.724]  Now, we've done a good job of having a lot of other leaders and a lot of other people and the idea out there, but it's still not as good as it should be.
[00:47:26.724 --> 00:47:39.911]  And I will tell you that it's normally a prelude to them setting you up or killing you for them to go ahead and demonize you in the media, so when they do kill you or set you up, they say, oh, this is the guy that was connected to the cop killer, and then that can kind of be your obituary.
[00:47:43.732 --> 00:47:55.683]  But more often than not, I should be thankful they're just trying to demonize me because that 80% of the time or more, that just means they're going the route of trying to discredit me.
[00:47:55.683 --> 00:47:58.366]  You understand?
[00:47:58.366 --> 00:47:59.807]  But from a selfish view,
[00:48:01.127 --> 00:48:05.210]  And I wouldn't have just done this from a selfish view if it wasn't the right thing to do anyways.
[00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:11.895]  But from a selfish view, studying history, studying leaders, studying this type of information, I've always said, no, I'm not your leader.
[00:48:11.895 --> 00:48:12.916]  No, I'm not the leader.
[00:48:12.916 --> 00:48:14.077]  No, I'm not going to lead the movement.
[00:48:14.077 --> 00:48:14.898]  You go out and lead it.
[00:48:14.898 --> 00:48:16.559]  You go out and set it up.
[00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:21.623]  Because that is when you really get a cap busted in your butt.
[00:48:23.188 --> 00:48:24.769]  That is when you get blasted.
[00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:26.149]  That is when you get killed.
[00:48:26.149 --> 00:48:30.071]  That's when they pull you over, shoot you up with something, so you have a heart attack.
[00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:39.254]  That's when they park a truck across your street, hitting you with radiation guns, which they admit they do, and, you know, you get cancer a week later and die of a week, you know, a one-week tumor.
[00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:42.960]  You've really been microwaved, basically.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.242]  As they admit now, they're using Fallujah.
[00:48:45.242 --> 00:48:55.288]  So, I mean, I've entered the most dangerous phase in my life, and now, because it's better for them to make it about leaders, they've made it about three people.
[00:48:55.288 --> 00:49:00.451]  Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Alex Jones.
[00:49:02.318 --> 00:49:12.525]  They have made it about Rush Limbaugh because he has a huge pumpkin head, he's a total drug addict, discredited, he makes shit about a right-wing paradigm, he's perfect for them, White House memos, they said they want to make it about Limbaugh.
[00:49:12.525 --> 00:49:19.150]  Glenn Beck on purpose is meant to act goofy when he brings up conspiracy theories, then he discredits his own theories with straw men.
[00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.851]  He's an operative.
[00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:36.209]  But with me, it's because they're trying to tie me in with the hatred of those two to try to create a meme or kind of a signpost, a logo, or a, you know, a term, a stereotype, Alex Jones.
[00:49:36.209 --> 00:49:45.997]  So that when people hear the information and they wonder why they're losing their house and why there's hyperinflation and why there's riots on the streets, they can just say Alex Jones.
[00:49:45.997 --> 00:49:48.239]  Like the term conspiracy theory to try to discredit.
[00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:56.495]  And so, what this means is, and it's been happening a lot in the past anyways, we have arrived.
[00:49:56.495 --> 00:50:01.539]  You know, that's why the mainstream media is constantly attacking me for years.
[00:50:01.539 --> 00:50:04.402]  That's why the neocons attack me for years.
[00:50:04.402 --> 00:50:13.350]  But see, the neocons, they can now act like they're out of power, and they need to build up their base again in the name of fighting Obama, so they're trying to co-opt what we do.
[00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:16.452]  That's why they, a little sprinkle here, a little sprinkle there, you know, they
[00:50:17.213 --> 00:50:18.614]  It's like I'm a cayenne pepper.
[00:50:18.614 --> 00:50:22.137]  They put one cayenne pepper in the soup to kind of camouflage themselves.
[00:50:22.137 --> 00:50:24.098]  Oh, come on, Geraldo Wancher.
[00:50:24.098 --> 00:50:26.100]  Come on, Napolitano.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.621]  And I'm not saying Napolitano's a bad guy.
[00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:28.422]  I've talked to him off-air.
[00:50:28.422 --> 00:50:29.643]  I've read his book.
[00:50:29.643 --> 00:50:30.563]  He's the real deal.
[00:50:30.563 --> 00:50:33.125]  He's one of us trying to live in their world.
[00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:33.946]  So is Lou Dobbs.
[00:50:33.946 --> 00:50:34.646]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[00:50:34.646 --> 00:50:36.007]  I've talked to him off-air.
[00:50:36.007 --> 00:50:37.769]  I know what's legitimate.
[00:50:37.769 --> 00:50:40.091]  I know what's real McCoy.
[00:50:40.091 --> 00:50:43.033]  Napolitano's real McCoy.
[00:50:43.033 --> 00:50:44.114]  Dobbs is real McCoy.
[00:50:45.905 --> 00:50:48.446]  Bias actions, but then also discernment.
[00:50:48.446 --> 00:50:49.107]  Anyways, I'm going to finish.
[00:50:49.107 --> 00:50:56.351]  This is so important, folks, because we got George Soros foundations and the Obama people on our tail.
[00:50:56.351 --> 00:50:57.692]  Are you watching my six, folks?
[00:50:57.692 --> 00:50:59.553]  Are you going to come in there and help me?
[00:50:59.553 --> 00:51:00.073]  Be right back.
[00:51:01.587 --> 00:51:03.428]  Are you embarrassed by your legs?
[00:51:03.428 --> 00:51:05.409]  Are your legs sore and irritated?
[00:51:05.409 --> 00:51:08.851]  Millions of women suffer from leg pain due to varicose veins.
[00:51:08.851 --> 00:51:13.814]  When varicose veins prevent you from living and enjoying your everyday life, you need Venulux.
[00:51:13.814 --> 00:51:19.337]  Venulux is a dietary tool formulated to restore naturally beautiful legs from the inside out.

[00:51:55.703 --> 00:52:02.271]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.568 --> 00:52:21.151]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.151 --> 00:52:23.131]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.131 --> 00:52:25.632]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.632 --> 00:52:37.197]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:38.877]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.877 --> 00:52:40.198]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.723 --> 00:52:47.628]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.628 --> 00:52:55.894]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.894 --> 00:52:57.475]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.475 --> 00:52:58.676]  The people strike back.
[00:53:02.108 --> 00:53:03.609]  Recognize that sound?
[00:53:03.609 --> 00:53:08.393]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:10.835]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:53:10.835 --> 00:53:16.160]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.564]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:53:21.564 --> 00:53:24.647]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:53:24.667 --> 00:53:25.247]  Let's do it!
[00:53:49.452 --> 00:53:52.673]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:53:52.673 --> 00:53:52.953]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:53:52.953 --> 00:53:53.853]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[00:53:53.853 --> 00:54:07.396]  I told you I passed the point of no return a long time ago.
[00:54:07.396 --> 00:54:13.798]  In, through, and beyond.
[00:54:19.915 --> 00:54:20.715]  That is our mission.
[00:54:20.715 --> 00:54:22.016]  We've already entered the New World Order.
[00:54:22.016 --> 00:54:25.238]  We've gone deep into the black hole.
[00:54:25.238 --> 00:54:27.959]  And we've got to go through and beyond.
[00:54:27.959 --> 00:54:30.180]  There is no turning back.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.602]  And the globalists, again, killed 200 plus million people last century alone.
[00:54:34.602 --> 00:54:35.223]  That's a fact.
[00:54:35.223 --> 00:54:35.983]  That's historical.
[00:54:35.983 --> 00:54:38.744]  It's now on record, mainline history books.
[00:54:38.744 --> 00:54:49.510]  The US government and the British government funded Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, all by design to wreck good, strong economies and to bring in globalist control.
[00:54:53.203 --> 00:54:57.725]  And that's all that's happening right now.
[00:54:57.725 --> 00:54:58.785]  And that's the real history.
[00:54:58.785 --> 00:55:00.265]  That's who the globalists are.
[00:55:00.265 --> 00:55:00.926]  They're conquerors.
[00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:07.068]  You know, that's what Cecil Rhodes had countries named after him, like Rhodesia, north of South Africa.
[00:55:07.068 --> 00:55:07.948]  That's what he called for.
[00:55:07.948 --> 00:55:09.669]  Go read his books, read his writings.
[00:55:09.669 --> 00:55:11.309]  I mean, here's the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:19.612]  You just go to cfr.org, and you type in global governance, global government in their search engine, and you'll get thousands of articles on their own website.
[00:55:21.178 --> 00:55:30.446]  And then you get Limbaugh saying it doesn't exist, and the Daily Kos saying it doesn't exist, and Raw Story saying it doesn't exist, and Alternet saying it doesn't exist, and the New York Times saying it doesn't exist.
[00:55:30.446 --> 00:55:32.087]  Well, I refuse to play your little game.
[00:55:32.087 --> 00:55:36.010]  See, they meant to have us just debate all day whether it exists or not.
[00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.653]  What a... I mean, how much contempt do they have for us?
[00:55:40.495 --> 00:55:47.620]  International Institutions and Global Governance Program, World Order in the 21st Century, a new initiative of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:55.064]  This is a policy paper that has their director, Richard N. Haas, and the rest of them's names on this.
[00:55:55.064 --> 00:55:59.948]  This is the official, this is like when a newspaper, you know, puts out who they endorse.
[00:55:59.948 --> 00:56:02.810]  This is put out by the Council on Foreign Relations executive body.
[00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:11.334]  Institutional, international institutions and global governance program, world order in the 21st century.
[00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:15.757]  And I've interviewed globalists and they'll say, we're not for world government, we're for global governance.
[00:56:15.757 --> 00:56:19.319]  Well, governance, global governance means global government.
[00:56:19.319 --> 00:56:25.223]  And they smile and giggle, knowing the public's dumbed down and doesn't know what governance means.
[00:56:25.223 --> 00:56:30.246]  The Council on Foreign Relations has launched a comprehensive five-year program on international institutions and global governance.
[00:56:31.854 --> 00:56:40.562]  The purpose of this cross-cutting initiative is to explore the institutional requirements for world order in the 21st century.
[00:56:40.562 --> 00:56:43.505]  And it goes on to talk about global government.
[00:56:43.505 --> 00:56:48.549]  Okay, now listen.
[00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:49.610]  This is reality.
[00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:50.791]  This is the real world.
[00:56:52.296 --> 00:57:03.446]  A peanut gallery where we're like two different football teams at home coming in different, you know, purple jerseys and yellow jerseys, throwing peanuts at each other and popcorn.
[00:57:03.446 --> 00:57:07.529]  I mean, every time I get attacked by a neocon, they're giggling and laughing, it's like they're having fun.
[00:57:07.529 --> 00:57:11.673]  And the liberals, the same, the fake liberals, hey man, this isn't fun, folks!
[00:57:11.673 --> 00:57:15.236]  The bankers stealing $12.8 trillion in six months, that means it's over.
[00:57:15.236 --> 00:57:16.837]  It's already fried.
[00:57:16.837 --> 00:57:19.580]  That means they're bringing this all the way down, and they just got started.
[00:57:20.936 --> 00:57:32.464]  The fact that Obama does have an Attorney General that filed briefings before the Supreme Court for a total, complete ban of any firearms of any type, including single-shot, for the American people.
[00:57:32.464 --> 00:57:36.387]  And that they've introduced all these bills, the most draconian in history.
[00:57:36.387 --> 00:57:37.347]  That's real!
[00:57:37.347 --> 00:57:40.830]  And you just can't sit over there saying it isn't real!
[00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:41.930]  Let me tell you something!
[00:57:43.051 --> 00:57:46.212]  You establishment George Soros finance people.
[00:57:46.212 --> 00:57:48.393]  This is going to lead to war.
[00:57:48.393 --> 00:57:50.774]  This is what I've been trying to stop.
[00:57:50.774 --> 00:57:52.815]  I like the red lights working.
[00:57:52.815 --> 00:57:55.036]  I like the power working.
[00:57:55.036 --> 00:57:57.737]  I like being able to go home and eat a hot meal.
[00:57:57.737 --> 00:58:01.658]  I don't have some romantic love of the coming conflict that's going to happen.
[00:58:01.658 --> 00:58:03.539]  The bloody civil war in this country.
[00:58:04.713 --> 00:58:25.745]  It isn't going to be nice, and the globalists are going to sit back while we tear each other's eyes out in their stupid left-right paradigm, their cop-versus-citizen paradigm, the troops-versus-the-people paradigm, and after we're done slaughtering each other like the Iraqis for three or four years, they're going to come in here and colonize us and turn us into a total third-world nation, and then that's when the secret arrest and stuff's going to start.
[00:58:26.405 --> 00:58:27.565]  This isn't a joke!
[00:58:27.565 --> 00:58:29.026]  This isn't a game!
[00:58:29.026 --> 00:58:31.206]  Have you seen everything we talk about come true?
[00:58:31.206 --> 00:58:38.108]  Well, the rest of it's gonna come true if you don't grow up and realize we're in deep trouble and break your left-right conditioning!
[00:58:38.108 --> 00:58:43.070]  We'll be right back!
[00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.570]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.865 --> 00:58:52.547]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.547 --> 00:58:57.293]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.293 --> 00:59:00.256]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.256 --> 00:59:03.300]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:08.026]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.246 --> 00:59:09.367]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.367 --> 00:59:12.610]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:19.616]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.972 --> 01:00:05.281]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.281 --> 01:00:06.582]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.582 --> 01:00:08.363]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.363 --> 01:00:10.125]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:11.707]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.707 --> 01:00:13.268]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.268 --> 01:00:17.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:19.794]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.678 --> 01:00:22.619]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.259]  I'm going to open the phones up, coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:25.259 --> 01:00:25.339]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:25.339 --> 01:00:26.720]  It is Wednesday, the 8th day of April 2009.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.860]  The people are in revolution.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:32.101]  The people are standing up to the bankers and the looting of the country.
[01:00:32.101 --> 01:00:36.782]  They thought Bush was behind it when he was just a figurehead, a yard gnome.
[01:00:51.058 --> 01:01:04.670]  And the people got wise to the fact the government was corrupt, so the establishment did a bait-and-switch, financed with over a billion dollars in campaign money, a billion more in other ads, put out by foundations, to put Barack H. Obama in power.
[01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:12.676]  Now we're two months into his administration, and a lot of grassroots leftists and mainstream writers are saying, this guy's worse than Bush!
[01:01:12.676 --> 01:01:14.218]  So now the honeymoon is wearing off,
[01:01:15.293 --> 01:01:26.544]  And so the establishment writers are going out trying to get the right-wing base under the control of Limbaugh and the left-wing base under the control of the Soros-controlled media empire.
[01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:29.166]  Air America and the rest of it.
[01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:33.610]  They are desperately trying to get their people back under their wings.
[01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:35.472]  And going, look, the right-wingers!
[01:01:35.472 --> 01:01:36.793]  Look, the right-wingers are going to get you!
[01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.095]  Alex Jones, he's a right-winger!
[01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:39.376]  Don't listen to him about the New World Order!
[01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:43.871]  And they're going to the right wing.
[01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:45.612]  Oh look, Obama's a commie!
[01:01:45.612 --> 01:01:47.152]  Don't let the commies get ya!
[01:01:47.152 --> 01:01:48.813]  Lush Limbaugh, fight the commies!
[01:01:48.813 --> 01:01:52.335]  Meanwhile, Limbaugh's for the banker bailouts, and so is Obama.
[01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:54.375]  Same crew.
[01:01:54.375 --> 01:02:04.200]  The National Security head, James Jones, General James Jones, openly writes articles for the CFR saying, I take all my orders from Henry Kissinger.
[01:02:06.539 --> 01:02:16.482]  Nixon, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush, the Vatican, the U.S., everybody just takes their orders from this guy because he's the Rothschild-Rockefeller agent.
[01:02:16.482 --> 01:02:18.122]  Publicly says he works for him.
[01:02:18.122 --> 01:02:21.003]  So, you know, here we are and it's like children!
[01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:23.503]  I sit here going, let's not look at the puppets, children.
[01:02:23.503 --> 01:02:25.564]  It's like when you've got a two-year-old and you've got two puppets in front of him.
[01:02:25.564 --> 01:02:26.204]  I've done this.
[01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:27.124]  The two-year-old won't look at you.
[01:02:27.124 --> 01:02:28.465]  You're going, hey honey, look at me.
[01:02:28.465 --> 01:02:30.965]  See the strings?
[01:02:30.965 --> 01:02:31.626]  You know, look honey.
[01:02:34.301 --> 01:02:38.684]  Fourteen-month-old daughter, and I'm like, look, look at the... And I'm like, look, these are puppets, see the strings, honey?
[01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:41.647]  She still hadn't figured out I'm controlling the two puppets.
[01:02:41.647 --> 01:02:48.772]  And I'm talking to adults going, look, man, it isn't about Obama, it isn't about Bush, it's about bankers, it's about power, it's about the military-industrial complex.
[01:02:48.772 --> 01:02:52.295]  You know, they're controlling us, and they're just like, shut up, right-winger.
[01:02:52.295 --> 01:02:54.417]  How dare you fascist nut like Obama?
[01:02:54.417 --> 01:02:57.339]  And I'm like, no, he works for the same people!
[01:02:57.339 --> 01:02:58.560]  They're like, sure, cop killer.
[01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:01.208]  I'm like, oh really?
[01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:05.231]  Here's his comments on Stormfront and InfoWars saying he doesn't like me.
[01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:19.604]  And the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center knew that and fed that to the media, and the media, the writer who got set up by him, had to come back and say, actually, in two separate articles, you know, I basically retracted, the guy didn't like Alex.
[01:03:19.604 --> 01:03:22.087]  But that doesn't stop.
[01:03:22.087 --> 01:03:26.811]  I've gotten calls and emails from two people, and we have confirmed
[01:03:29.926 --> 01:03:38.848]  But this is going on, that Big Air America host, I had my notes here, where'd they go?
[01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:53.331]  Big Air America host, are attacking me, here's one of the emails, but I also got a call from someone I know who heard it, I think you should all have Stephanie Miller as a guest on the show, she was repeating the smear that Alex is calling for violence, etc.
[01:03:54.889 --> 01:03:56.530]  They're gonna make me sue him.
[01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:59.352]  Thankfully, a caller called in and defended him within moments.
[01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:02.433]  Yeah, because we've got the left audience, we've got the right audience.
[01:04:02.433 --> 01:04:03.314]  The paradigm's broke.
[01:04:03.314 --> 01:04:04.535]  The people are together now.
[01:04:04.535 --> 01:04:06.816]  It flummoxed her so much that she hung up on him.
[01:04:06.816 --> 01:04:11.338]  This happened on my ride to work approximately 10-15 minutes ago.
[01:04:11.338 --> 01:04:12.939]  This came in about 10 o'clock.
[01:04:12.939 --> 01:04:16.601]  If you have an Air America affiliate in Austin, I'd check and see what else she says.
[01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:20.484]  She's having a Media Matters guest on the MAR to continue the smears and associate Jones with Beck.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.661]  Just a heads up, keep up the great work.
[01:04:23.661 --> 01:04:26.743]  Yeah, we need to, you know, you know what's sick?
[01:04:26.743 --> 01:04:36.529]  When Air America was about to go under, even though I knew Soros was involved with it, you know, I said, well, it's good to have some difference, you know, at least they're attacking Bush some, you know, and I had a few of their guests on.
[01:04:36.529 --> 01:04:38.751]  This is what I get from you.
[01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:49.157]  Listen to me, Miller, there's some people who won't put up with your crap.
[01:04:51.368 --> 01:04:53.709]  Okay?
[01:04:53.709 --> 01:04:54.650]  And you know what?
[01:04:54.650 --> 01:05:01.213]  Let some harm to me, legally, whatever, which isn't going to happen, come from this, then I'm going to be forced to sue you.
[01:05:01.213 --> 01:05:08.076]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[01:05:08.076 --> 01:05:09.016]  It's true.
[01:05:09.016 --> 01:05:14.599]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:14.599 --> 01:05:15.960]  Not if, but when.
[01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:18.821]  Let's do it!
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:41.385]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:45.368]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[01:05:45.368 --> 01:05:47.830]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.092]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:50.092 --> 01:05:52.654]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:52.654 --> 01:05:53.154]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:05:53.154 --> 01:05:53.194]  877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.184 --> 01:06:07.012]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.012 --> 01:06:13.981]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.582 --> 01:06:21.167]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:23.149]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.149 --> 01:06:25.651]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.651 --> 01:06:37.220]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.902]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:38.902 --> 01:06:40.263]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:40.743 --> 01:06:47.645]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.645 --> 01:06:55.907]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:55.907 --> 01:06:57.488]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.488 --> 01:06:58.668]  The people strike back.
[01:07:03.247 --> 01:07:10.954]  Have you heard on radio all the new teas with funny names, movie stars, celebrities endorsing these products and so on?
[01:07:10.954 --> 01:07:12.576]  Have you checked the results?
[01:07:12.576 --> 01:07:15.959]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:21.304]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:22.465]  Have you checked their results?
[01:07:22.465 --> 01:07:23.566]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[01:07:23.566 --> 01:07:26.029]  Did you check the ingredients and you checked for caffeine?
[01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.549]  Yeah!
[01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:29.271]  Life Change Tea is the real deal.
[01:07:29.271 --> 01:07:34.195]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[01:07:34.195 --> 01:07:35.636]  And it will clean your body.
[01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:36.977]  Our middle name is Results.
[01:07:36.977 --> 01:07:39.218]  You can pay more and you can have a celebrity smile.
[01:07:39.218 --> 01:07:40.439]  Or you can get results.
[01:07:40.439 --> 01:07:41.020]  Your call.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:43.261]  Or should I say, make the call.
[01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:43.942]  Get the tea at 928-308-0408.
[01:07:43.942 --> 01:07:44.262]  That's 928-308-0408.
[01:07:44.262 --> 01:07:46.323]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:47.004]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:07:57.131 --> 01:08:01.932]  Order now for real results.
[01:08:01.932 --> 01:08:08.274]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.274 --> 01:08:12.755]  We're going to get Stuart Rhodes popping in for about 15-20 minutes on Oath Keepers.
[01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:18.337]  Thousands and thousands of police and military swearing to uphold and protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:08:18.337 --> 01:08:19.457]  That's coming up.
[01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:22.738]  Then Michael McNair, a constitutional scholar, getting into a host of issues.
[01:08:22.738 --> 01:08:22.978]  Former
[01:08:23.838 --> 01:08:26.679]  Presidential candidate, nominee of the Libertarian Party, 2004.
[01:08:26.679 --> 01:08:29.781]  He'll be joining us coming up in the final hour today.
[01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:37.804]  Jason Burmess will be with us in about an hour and thirty minutes after Stuart Rhodes leaves us to debunk part two of Glenn Beck's debunking.
[01:08:37.804 --> 01:08:40.566]  And folks, I am exactly right.
[01:08:40.566 --> 01:08:43.107]  Three weeks ago, because I know what is fake,
[01:08:44.477 --> 01:08:45.698]  I know what was fake.
[01:08:45.698 --> 01:08:53.867]  I knew that Linda Thompson's video of the Amtrak repair facility in Illinois was fake.
[01:08:54.778 --> 01:08:55.518]  I've known that forever.
[01:08:55.518 --> 01:08:56.539]  It's been out since 95.
[01:08:56.539 --> 01:09:02.903]  I mean, I've had that tape mailed to me probably 150 times, no exaggeration, back when it was on VHS.
[01:09:02.903 --> 01:09:04.944]  E-mailed to me thousands of times.
[01:09:04.944 --> 01:09:07.666]  And I know that they have training facilities, and I haven't even seen this yet.
[01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:10.207]  Burmese was just telling me, I didn't see the debunking part 2 last night.
[01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:12.829]  Burmese is coming in, that's why he's coming in to tell us about it and play the clips.
[01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:14.150]  He said, you were right again.
[01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:20.373]  They showed the Louisiana, Mississippi NATO training base and said it was a military training base.
[01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:24.016]  And then somebody online, probably one of their associates, mismarked
[01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:30.880]  A North Korean FEMA camp, death camp, control camp, and said U.S.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.561]  base.
[01:09:32.561 --> 01:09:34.483]  See, straw men!
[01:09:34.483 --> 01:09:38.505]  That's what, now I didn't peg the North Korean thing, because I hadn't seen that hoax.
[01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:40.647]  And so, that's what they're going to do.
[01:09:40.647 --> 01:09:43.809]  Hundreds of real camps, government documents, congressional testimony.
[01:09:43.809 --> 01:09:45.110]  Oh, they didn't play that.
[01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:47.892]  They went directly to the fake debunking.
[01:09:53.007 --> 01:09:56.708]  And what we're doing is we're educating the public and showing them the tricks they play here.
[01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:57.989]  I mean, I'm not that smart.
[01:09:57.989 --> 01:10:01.650]  You learn their tricks, you know their tricks, you know what play they're going to call.
[01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:09.072]  It's like you may have a football team you love, and you've been watching them for decades, or watching a coach from team to team, and 98% of the time you know what he's going to call.
[01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:12.073]  Because you watch football.
[01:10:12.073 --> 01:10:13.193]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[01:10:13.193 --> 01:10:17.655]  We watch the enemy and we know all their tricks, and they're so predictable it's disgusting.
[01:10:19.744 --> 01:10:22.626]  It's like we aren't blind, but the general public is.
[01:10:22.626 --> 01:10:25.368]  It's like we've had the blinders taken off, and the public hasn't.
[01:10:25.368 --> 01:10:27.770]  I'm just like, take the blinders off, please!
[01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:29.992]  And the media goes, no, don't listen to conspiracies.
[01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.293]  Don't take your blinders off.
[01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.173]  Don't look.
[01:10:32.173 --> 01:10:33.114]  Don't look.
[01:10:33.114 --> 01:10:39.259]  Listen to the liberals, and listen to the conservatives, and listen to what they have to say, and be sucked into the paradigm, and get into the sports team.
[01:10:39.259 --> 01:10:40.359]  Rah, rah.
[01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:40.660]  I'm for...
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:11:03.021]  The Republican, I'm for the Democrat, you know, I'm for McCain, I'm for Obama and they give you these two choices and you get all fired up and get invested and get committed and tie up your psyche with one of the candidates and then you're committed to that false paradigm and the globalists go on while you're busy watching this false projection they put out, the Matrix.
[01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:05.784]  They're taking over our freedoms and our liberties.
[01:11:08.482 --> 01:11:16.208]  And so the establishment in closing, and I'm going to your calls, is getting desperate because they've lost their initiative.
[01:11:16.208 --> 01:11:20.131]  They're having to go through gun control now and victim disarmament covertly.
[01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:21.772]  They're having to harass gun shops.
[01:11:21.772 --> 01:11:23.093]  They're having to shut them down with harassment.
[01:11:23.093 --> 01:11:28.577]  They're having to use what the executive powers, you know, to shut down importation outside Congress.
[01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:33.101]  They're having to, you know, just expand their powers unconstitutionally.
[01:11:33.101 --> 01:11:35.903]  They've tripled the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
[01:11:37.841 --> 01:11:40.763]  They've got an Attorney General who's inherently anti-gun.
[01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:44.305]  They've introduced all these bills, but they won't discuss the bills.
[01:11:44.305 --> 01:11:47.607]  They can't come out and bash people for not passing them.
[01:11:47.607 --> 01:11:52.350]  Even though most of the bills are stuff that the White House Chief of Staff introduced when he was a leading Congressman from Illinois.
[01:11:52.350 --> 01:12:01.356]  And we've gone over those bills and read the bill numbers and, you know, we've read on-air Attorney General holders filing to the Supreme Court saying, ban all guns.
[01:12:01.356 --> 01:12:01.556]  I mean,
[01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:07.881]  Don't you understand how you get discredited, George Soros, Foundation, fake liberals?
[01:12:07.881 --> 01:12:11.644]  You know, they're there to co-opt the left, Linbaugh's there to co-opt the right.
[01:12:11.644 --> 01:12:15.326]  Same thing with Hannity and Glenn Beck and the rest of them.
[01:12:15.326 --> 01:12:25.714]  And see, the left has woken up to this new world order being real, so they're waking up and joining the people, and so the establishment's trying to keep their people on the reservation, on the plantation.
[01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:27.894]  Same thing with Limbaugh and their guys.
[01:12:27.894 --> 01:12:33.280]  They're having to cover a little bit of it now, but saying, okay, there's a world government, but it's Obama trying it.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.141]  Well, yeah, he's carrying the ball right now.
[01:12:35.141 --> 01:12:36.943]  He's the quarterback in the game right now.
[01:12:36.943 --> 01:12:38.405]  They've pulled McCain out.
[01:12:38.405 --> 01:12:40.867]  Now they've pulled Bush out.
[01:12:40.867 --> 01:12:45.311]  They've got the celebrity quarterback in there, but he works for the same franchise owner.
[01:12:45.311 --> 01:12:46.813]  Use KRS-One's analogy.
[01:12:49.793 --> 01:12:52.534]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:53.715]  And they're getting upset, folks.
[01:12:53.715 --> 01:12:57.957]  I'm getting contacted constantly by huge rap icons, but most of them are scared to come on the show.
[01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:02.419]  Karis1 contacted us again yesterday, says he wants me to go on tour some places with him.
[01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:03.839]  Unfortunately, I don't have the time to do it.
[01:13:03.839 --> 01:13:05.820]  Wants to work with me on projects.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.601]  Had all these other big rap icons contacting us.
[01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:11.343]  That paradigm shattering with them completely.
[01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:16.605]  All these other... Again, the people are coming together against the bankers, against the offshore corporations.
[01:13:17.915 --> 01:13:19.528]  that are robbing everybody.
[01:13:21.542 --> 01:13:22.683]  I'm a populist.
[01:13:22.683 --> 01:13:23.844]  I'm a liberty person.
[01:13:23.844 --> 01:13:24.645]  I want freedom.
[01:13:24.645 --> 01:13:25.906]  I want private property rights.
[01:13:25.906 --> 01:13:27.027]  I want Second Amendment.
[01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:28.008]  I want sovereignty.
[01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:31.791]  I don't want to pay $12.8 trillion to offshore bankers that engineered the collapse.
[01:13:31.791 --> 01:13:35.334]  If we're going to have socialism, might as well just pay off the mortgages.
[01:13:35.334 --> 01:13:43.822]  Bloomberg Financial reported three months ago when it was at $9 trillion, or two months ago when it was at $9 trillion, that that would have paid off 90 plus percent of the mortgages.
[01:13:43.822 --> 01:13:45.423]  It's now at $12.8 trillion.
[01:13:45.423 --> 01:13:48.086]  That would pay off the mortgages and then all the credit card debt.
[01:13:48.973 --> 01:13:50.234]  They've done the math.
[01:13:50.234 --> 01:13:53.495]  $12.8 trillion would pay off all mortgages, period.
[01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.036]  Every mortgage in America.
[01:13:55.036 --> 01:14:00.778]  Donald Trump's mortgage, your mortgage, my mortgage, and all the credit card debt and then some.
[01:14:00.778 --> 01:14:03.440]  All your credit card debt gone.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.540]  You would have been paying for it, though.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.881]  They're taking it from you in tax money.
[01:14:06.881 --> 01:14:08.082]  All the mortgages paid for.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.043]  They have stolen more money than all the mortgages put together.
[01:14:13.043 --> 01:14:14.264]  You know, that's an article we ought to write.
[01:14:14.264 --> 01:14:16.045]  I saw those numbers.
[01:14:16.045 --> 01:14:17.967]  But we need to point that out before Bloomberg does.
[01:14:17.967 --> 01:14:22.651]  You know, they pointed out when it was $8.7 trillion.
[01:14:22.651 --> 01:14:24.573]  Two and a half months ago, they pointed out.
[01:14:24.573 --> 01:14:25.814]  In fact, here's the exact headline.
[01:14:25.814 --> 01:14:31.078]  Let me pull it up from memory.
[01:14:31.078 --> 01:14:34.961]  Bailout money would pay off 90% of U.S.
[01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:35.382]  mortgages.
[01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:39.791]  90% of all mortgages.
[01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:40.471]  That's the headline.
[01:14:40.471 --> 01:14:42.633]  Print that for me.
[01:14:42.633 --> 01:14:44.754]  Bailout Bloomberg.
[01:14:44.754 --> 01:14:45.654]  Guys, Google this.
[01:14:45.654 --> 01:14:46.815]  Bloomberg.
[01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.555]  Everybody else do this.
[01:14:47.555 --> 01:14:48.556]  We're doing this together.
[01:14:48.556 --> 01:14:54.539]  Bloomberg.
[01:14:54.539 --> 01:14:58.501]  Bailout money would pay off 90% of mortgages.
[01:14:58.501 --> 01:15:01.883]  Now, that was an 8.7 trill.
[01:15:01.883 --> 01:15:05.525]  I happen to know that the credit card debt in this country
[01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:10.924]  is way less than a trillion.
[01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:13.486]  So let's do the math.
[01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:22.374]  If 8.7 paid off 90 percent, then 10 trillion would have paid off, and then some, every mortgage in America.
[01:15:22.374 --> 01:15:24.335]  So 10 trillion pays off 100 percent.
[01:15:24.335 --> 01:15:29.920]  And then you've got 2.8 trillion, which is roughly three times the credit card debt.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.601]  So it would pay off
[01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:34.030]  Pull up the college loans.
[01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.032]  I know that's less than a trillion that it would pay off.
[01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:48.628]  All the college loans, all the credit cards, all the mortgages in America, and then some, and you're paying for it in taxes.
[01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.530]  That's why they're raising all the taxes now.
[01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:51.492]  Obama lied about that.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.680]  And they're just getting started.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.861]  That was in six months and they're getting ready to accelerate the looting.
[01:15:58.861 --> 01:16:02.802]  It's going to be double the GDP at this rate in six more months.
[01:16:02.802 --> 01:16:04.502]  Double the GDP!
[01:16:04.502 --> 01:16:08.223]  Twenty-six plus trillion dollars!
[01:16:08.223 --> 01:16:11.264]  Twenty-six trillion dollars!
[01:16:11.264 --> 01:16:14.385]  They're totally raping and looting everything forever.
[01:16:14.385 --> 01:16:16.085]  This is already impossible to pay back.
[01:16:18.928 --> 01:16:22.290]  And the elite, while the money still has value, are buying everything up with it right now.
[01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:28.113]  And of course they've got all the paid-off liberal bloggers and paid-off liberal George Soros people attacking us.
[01:16:28.113 --> 01:16:30.354]  I'm on air saying arrest the bankers.
[01:16:30.354 --> 01:16:32.476]  I'm on air saying they've committed crimes.
[01:16:32.476 --> 01:16:40.120]  I'm on air saying in the IMF documents they blow economies out so bad that things break down into riots and they call that the IMF riot.
[01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:42.971]  Google that, you'll read their own documents.
[01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:44.652]  BBC News reporting on it.
[01:16:44.652 --> 01:16:51.838]  And then when things really break down for a few months, then they bring in martial law and the people beg for it!
[01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:53.540]  Everything's already falling apart.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.844]  Even the Washington Post admits that the mass shootings are because everybody's out of work and going psycho.
[01:16:58.844 --> 01:17:02.768]  What's gonna happen when you set a 6 million people out of work, you got 30 million people out of work.
[01:17:04.485 --> 01:17:08.449]  What's going to happen as Mexico collapses and even more illegal aliens run up here?
[01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:10.210]  There's dead cops all over the place.
[01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:12.072]  There's going to be dead military all over the place.
[01:17:12.072 --> 01:17:16.236]  They're going to have them marching around trying to take people's guns in the middle of all this.
[01:17:16.236 --> 01:17:19.439]  As Mexico collapses, the Attorney General already came out.
[01:17:19.719 --> 01:17:24.343]  In press conferences they say we've got to restrict the Second Amendment, because the guns are causing it in Mexico.
[01:17:24.343 --> 01:17:28.666]  And you know they're going to say, take the guns, there's rioting and breakdown of society.
[01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:35.531]  And they're going to march the police right into hell, march the military right into hell, because the American people aren't going to turn their guns in!
[01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:48.941]  And when there's dead cops and military everywhere, they're going to blame me for trying to stop the bankers raping us and starting this, when it's in their own IMF and World Bank documents that they want to have a war between the police and military and the people.
[01:17:50.282 --> 01:18:02.529]  It's George Soros and David Rockefeller and Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger and the New World Order and the CFR and the Trilateral Commission that have engineered all this.
[01:18:02.529 --> 01:18:04.290]  The great game.
[01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.431]  The IMF documents, they planned all this.
[01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:10.853]  I've been telling you this since we got the documents in late 2001.
[01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:15.456]  It's the last chapter in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:18:15.456 --> 01:18:16.997]  Do you understand what's happening?
[01:18:16.997 --> 01:18:18.858]  Do you understand what's going on here?
[01:18:20.472 --> 01:18:22.352]  I told you all this was going to happen!
[01:18:22.352 --> 01:18:29.874]  I told you as the cops started getting killed that they're going to sit there and try to go after those of us warning people of how this was all planned!
[01:18:29.874 --> 01:18:37.416]  How many times, police, did I tell you five years ago, get out of your mortgage, that it was going to be a derivatives crash?
[01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:38.416]  You did it, a lot of you.
[01:18:38.416 --> 01:18:40.297]  You listened, didn't you?
[01:18:40.297 --> 01:18:43.797]  I told you to buy gold when it was $268 an ounce.
[01:18:43.797 --> 01:18:45.398]  It's up at $900 and something right now.
[01:18:46.474 --> 01:18:47.675]  I told you!
[01:18:47.675 --> 01:18:51.619]  Of course it's going to cause paranoia, because it isn't paranoid if they're after you.
[01:18:51.619 --> 01:18:53.701]  And then it manifests itself.
[01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:57.485]  Do you understand you're meant to be completely chewed up and destroyed in all of this?
[01:18:57.485 --> 01:19:01.228]  They want to get rid of you and bring in a new order after you.
[01:19:01.228 --> 01:19:02.370]  You're being set up.
[01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.591]  We're being set up.
[01:19:03.591 --> 01:19:05.252]  We've been right about everything.
[01:19:05.252 --> 01:19:06.674]  We've got incredible credibility.
[01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:15.955]  And I've tried my best to create more leaders, get more organizations going, but society... I guess that's why there aren't too many real leaders.
[01:19:15.955 --> 01:19:31.166]  Society's so mentally ill and sick, most of the people I've woken up and spawned in the movements I've created, including Ron Paul admitting we got his movement off the ground, half his support in the first four months of his run, you, the listeners, launched him.
[01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.207]  People say, oh, well, he didn't win, so it was a failure.
[01:19:33.207 --> 01:19:35.469]  No, that made the Liberty Movement go mainstream.
[01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:36.790]  It's a step, it's a process.
[01:19:39.284 --> 01:19:44.147]  And then they send in the disinfo operatives to try to get us all fighting with each other within the left-right paradigm.
[01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:47.129]  You know, oh, Alex works for George Soros when I was bashing Bush.
[01:19:47.129 --> 01:19:50.672]  Now Alex works for the Republicans because I'm bashing Obama.
[01:19:50.672 --> 01:19:52.653]  Those are operatives that are saying that.
[01:19:52.653 --> 01:19:54.814]  We are entering the vortex here, folks.
[01:19:54.814 --> 01:19:56.495]  Put your thinking caps on.
[01:19:56.495 --> 01:19:57.396]  A ton of other news.

[01:21:07.857 --> 01:21:13.721]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.721 --> 01:21:20.225]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:22.206]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:22.206 --> 01:21:24.667]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:35.554]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.842 --> 01:21:39.503]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.503 --> 01:21:41.364]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:41.364 --> 01:21:48.289]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:23:57.371 --> 01:24:03.015]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[01:24:03.015 --> 01:24:05.617]  You know, I didn't finish all my points about all the hit pieces.
[01:24:05.617 --> 01:24:08.559]  So I'm gonna finish those now and then I will go directly to your calls.
[01:24:08.559 --> 01:24:11.802]  Tony, Chris, Gary, Kathy, Matt, many others when we go to the next segment.
[01:24:13.703 --> 01:24:15.704]  It's very simple.
[01:24:15.704 --> 01:24:20.186]  There's all these news articles, New York Times, Alternet, everywhere.
[01:24:20.186 --> 01:24:25.268]  And the Alternet's the meanest yet.
[01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:28.450]  Did paranoid right-wing media fuel the Pittsburgh cop-killers rage?
[01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:29.951]  And then he goes on to attack me.
[01:24:29.951 --> 01:24:32.432]  Basically, the whole article's about me.
[01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:35.692]  And it's just disgusting.
[01:24:35.692 --> 01:24:44.438]  And it says, while Alex Jones generally avoids overt racism, he has found an eager audience on Stormfront by conjuring dark visions of an impending New World Order.
[01:24:44.438 --> 01:24:45.659]  No.
[01:24:45.659 --> 01:24:48.801]  What's happened is, I wake people up to the New World Order like no one else.
[01:24:48.801 --> 01:24:50.042]  I mean, it's admitted by everybody.
[01:24:50.042 --> 01:24:52.303]  You go out and talk to somebody, what woke up to the New World Order?
[01:24:52.303 --> 01:24:54.345]  Oh, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[01:24:54.345 --> 01:24:55.706]  It's more than Ron Paul.
[01:24:55.706 --> 01:24:57.407]  It's Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[01:24:58.957 --> 01:25:07.023]  And, yeah, some of them go and get picked up by the Israeli lobby's little false paradigm that it's all the Vatican.
[01:25:07.023 --> 01:25:09.225]  And I'm not saying the Vatican isn't involved in the New World Order.
[01:25:09.225 --> 01:25:09.866]  I'm not Catholic.
[01:25:09.866 --> 01:25:11.587]  I don't have a dog in the fight.
[01:25:11.587 --> 01:25:12.968]  That's definitely an Israeli operation.
[01:25:12.968 --> 01:25:13.989]  That's been proven.
[01:25:13.989 --> 01:25:15.330]  So they get picked up by that crowd.
[01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:17.752]  They get picked up by the anti-Semitic crowd.
[01:25:17.752 --> 01:25:20.794]  They get picked up by weird New Age UFO crowds.
[01:25:20.794 --> 01:25:22.335]  But that's the minority of people.
[01:25:22.335 --> 01:25:26.919]  Most folks wake up and get up to speed and get smarter and more informed than I am about all this stuff.
[01:25:29.298 --> 01:25:33.100]  But, I mean, I can tell you how many people I've woken up or gotten involved.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.001]  I mean, let's just be frank.
[01:25:34.001 --> 01:25:57.695]  There wouldn't be a movement at this level if it wasn't for my actions, because I realized history, and I realized the power of listeners taking action and being leaders, and viral media, and viral videos, and making copies of films, and Access TV 12 years ago, 13, 14 years ago, telling my listeners on shortwave, and then satellite, and internet, and AM and FM, get copies of these out, and you did it, and that's why we've had success.
[01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:10.601]  You know, I studied movements, even though I didn't like the Ayatollah Khomeini, I noticed how they educated folks by handing out cassette tapes, copies of those, to person to person.
[01:26:10.601 --> 01:26:12.544]  And I said, I'm going to do that against the New World Order.
[01:26:14.403 --> 01:26:18.529]  And so I read history, so I knew the ways to do this.
[01:26:18.529 --> 01:26:22.514]  And so now, though, I've never been a control freak about it either.
[01:26:22.514 --> 01:26:28.161]  I just try to cast the seeds out and how they grow and how they hybridize or mix with other ideas.
[01:26:28.161 --> 01:26:29.423]  That's not my issue.
[01:26:29.423 --> 01:26:31.385]  Justice be done, though the heavens fall.
[01:26:32.583 --> 01:26:36.285]  They're going to be nuts and schizophrenics to hear this stuff and get freaked out, absolutely.
[01:26:36.285 --> 01:26:38.927]  But it's not my fault the government's coming after the Second Amendment.
[01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:44.210]  It's not my fault they're announcing global government, or they've imploded the economy, and people are losing their jobs.
[01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:54.276]  And it's asinine for this corrupt, bankrupt, degenerate system to then try to point the finger at me, saying the way out of this is to prosecute the bankers for their crimes.
[01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:55.236]  That is the way to end this.
[01:26:55.236 --> 01:27:00.600]  Go, the New World Order is a hoax, it's an illusion, it's a mirage, it's a bunch of guys in fancy suits that are criminals.
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:12.797]  Standing around trying to exempt themselves from their own laws through a global government, who happen to be into eugenics and land grabbing and hating their fellow man, which is what elites are always into.
[01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:17.187]  So that's where I stand on all of this.
[01:27:17.187 --> 01:27:20.289]  And this means we're just having more success that we're being attacked.
[01:27:20.289 --> 01:27:23.810]  And it's a badge of honor they're trying all of this.
[01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:25.951]  And it's very bracing.
[01:27:25.951 --> 01:27:26.812]  It's not frightening.
[01:27:26.812 --> 01:27:27.552]  It's not exciting.
[01:27:27.552 --> 01:27:29.913]  It's bracing, like jumping into freezing water.
[01:27:29.913 --> 01:27:34.376]  It's very animating to know we're having this type of effect and know I'm in this position.
[01:27:34.376 --> 01:27:38.198]  It's an amazing responsibility.
[01:27:38.198 --> 01:27:42.860]  And so you got George Soros who told a press conference, Globe and Mail, Associated Press,
[01:27:44.517 --> 01:27:50.479]  I'm having a very good crisis as Soros as the hedge fund managers make billions off recession.
[01:27:50.479 --> 01:27:56.502]  George Soros went on to say it is the culmination of my life's work and has been very stimulating.
[01:27:57.386 --> 01:27:58.146]  That's a quote.
[01:27:58.146 --> 01:28:05.791]  Now that's who owns and finances these major sites attacking me, including Media Matters, publicly run by Soros.
[01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:09.693]  And he's coming out with a vicious attack piece.
[01:28:09.693 --> 01:28:19.840]  Doesn't matter if the original newspaper that got fed this stuff on the Southern Poverty Law Center in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has had to admit, oh my gosh, Alex Jones had the white supremacist after him.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.662]  Actually, the cop killer didn't like Alex and disagreed with Alex about non-violence.
[01:28:25.751 --> 01:28:34.199]  That's all bypassed, and the new article's being written about me, linked to the original article.
[01:28:34.199 --> 01:28:37.642]  See, I have George Soros, who's having a great time.
[01:28:37.642 --> 01:28:39.444]  See, he doesn't want you looking at him.
[01:28:39.444 --> 01:28:42.487]  See, I'm on air calling for his arrest, as many other nations are doing.
[01:28:43.393 --> 01:28:44.774]  Not just one individual.
[01:28:44.774 --> 01:28:45.834]  See, that's the reality.
[01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:47.295]  You are criminals.
[01:28:47.295 --> 01:28:48.516]  The Emperor is butt naked.
[01:28:48.516 --> 01:28:49.677]  He's wearing no clothes.
[01:28:49.677 --> 01:28:50.697]  This is a fraud.
[01:28:50.697 --> 01:29:06.207]  All I'm doing is saying those are Ponzi scheme scammers who've got dreams of grandeur, delusions of grandeur, so big that they're openly doing it and setting up world government where we're taxed by the very banks that engineered the crisis.
[01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:07.948]  Now, if you want to be part of that, fine.
[01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:14.531]  Whether you call yourself a liberal, a conservative, a libertarian, a Muslim, an atheist, it doesn't matter.
[01:29:14.531 --> 01:29:19.012]  You know, we're all in the crosshairs of the New World Order.
[01:29:19.012 --> 01:29:23.072]  And I want you all to live free, and I want to live free, and I know how serious these globalists are, man.
[01:29:23.072 --> 01:29:24.593]  They financed a bunch of mass murders.
[01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:29.874]  In fact, it just came out in a big headline.
[01:29:29.874 --> 01:29:32.074]  German government unearths new documents about U.S.
[01:29:32.074 --> 01:29:33.754]  government funding Pol Pot.
[01:29:33.754 --> 01:29:34.934]  You unearthed documents?
[01:29:34.934 --> 01:29:35.595]  In fact, Google that.
[01:29:35.595 --> 01:29:36.295]  I forgot to print it.
[01:29:38.926 --> 01:29:45.089]  Brzezinski's written two books bragging how he funded the capping of three million Cambodians.
[01:29:45.089 --> 01:29:47.230]  I mean, these guys brag about their kills.
[01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:48.411]  I mean, come on!
[01:29:48.411 --> 01:29:49.511]  That's who's attacking me right now.
[01:29:49.511 --> 01:29:51.452]  You think that's fun?
[01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:52.833]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.833 --> 01:29:55.374]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.374 --> 01:29:58.056]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:02.652]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:30:02.652 --> 01:30:05.075]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:30:05.075 --> 01:30:09.219]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:30:09.219 --> 01:30:11.101]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout...
[01:30:15.984 --> 01:30:25.392]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:30:25.392 --> 01:30:31.776]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:30:31.776 --> 01:30:35.379]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:30:35.379 --> 01:30:39.522]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:30:44.616 --> 01:30:47.857]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:47.857 --> 01:30:52.098]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:21.404]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.404 --> 01:31:23.384]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.384 --> 01:31:25.885]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.885 --> 01:31:36.850]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.452 --> 01:31:39.113]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.113 --> 01:31:40.974]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:40.974 --> 01:31:47.898]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:47.898 --> 01:31:56.162]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.162 --> 01:31:57.723]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.723 --> 01:31:58.924]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.050 --> 01:32:03.030]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:09.992]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:32:09.992 --> 01:32:18.394]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:32:18.394 --> 01:32:24.115]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:32:24.315 --> 01:32:26.136]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:32:26.136 --> 01:32:28.337]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:32:28.337 --> 01:32:32.860]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:35.061]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:32:35.061 --> 01:32:42.906]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:43.446]  We're good.
[01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:52.827]  We are back live.
[01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:54.287]  Alright, go on to your calls.
[01:33:54.287 --> 01:33:57.569]  I just want to make it clear.
[01:33:57.569 --> 01:34:11.777]  The establishment did this gamble and is trying to have a messianic leader to carry out their operations because they've been exposed, their hand has been exposed in this game of poker.
[01:34:11.777 --> 01:34:17.041]  And so they're trying to fool people with Obama and he's already starting to stall and run out of gas.
[01:34:18.857 --> 01:34:23.978]  That means false flag terror attack, or new wars, and or both.
[01:34:23.978 --> 01:34:26.619]  And so I'm telling you they're getting ready to hit us right between the eyes.
[01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:32.280]  These guys want to keep their locomotion going, they want to keep their operation movement, and I know how they operate.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:40.862]  That's why even Michael Savage has come out and said Obama will stage terror attacks in America to bring in martial law.
[01:34:40.862 --> 01:34:44.083]  See, he wouldn't say that about 9-11, because that was his precious George Bush.
[01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:56.293]  But that idea has so gotten into people's minds and the fact that folks have found Operation Northwoods and all the real events that were carried out by the military-industrial complex, by those that have hijacked our nation.
[01:34:58.652 --> 01:34:59.912]  That he's having to talk about it.
[01:34:59.912 --> 01:35:02.693]  And they're having to admit global currency and world government.
[01:35:02.693 --> 01:35:04.753]  And that's why this is desperation.
[01:35:04.753 --> 01:35:15.396]  It's ridiculous for the New York Times and all these big establishment papers to come out and try to single me out and attack me and make me the big boogeyman.
[01:35:15.396 --> 01:35:17.997]  That just shows how pathetic they are.
[01:35:17.997 --> 01:35:19.717]  They're having to try to discredit me now?
[01:35:21.678 --> 01:35:24.181]  As if you can discredit the movement and the idea?
[01:35:24.181 --> 01:35:25.783]  It's too late!
[01:35:25.783 --> 01:35:29.948]  You can make up whatever you wanted about me, it's too late.
[01:35:29.948 --> 01:35:38.379]  You see, if they do kill me or set me up or destroy me, I just want folks to know whatever happens in the end, I win.
[01:35:38.379 --> 01:35:39.000]  And you win too.
[01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:52.867]  As long as the ideal lives on, as long as humanity moves forward, as long as we bring these criminals to justice, as long as the species survives, and then literally the globalists are talking about engineering society getting rid of most of us, you know, this transhumanist stuff.
[01:35:52.867 --> 01:35:55.348]  I mean, this is for all the marbles.
[01:35:55.348 --> 01:35:56.248]  I win.
[01:35:56.248 --> 01:36:00.950]  So, I mean, but I do want it beforehand to be known that I go into this willingly.
[01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:06.511]  I mean, I don't just think I'm sticking my head in a meat grinder and then ha ha, look at him, he just got chewed up.
[01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:08.392]  I want folks to know I went into this willingly.
[01:36:11.758 --> 01:36:14.899]  I want that on record.
[01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:21.261]  As an example to you, not so people down the road say, oh man, Alex had incredible courage, look what he did, he knew what he was doing.
[01:36:21.261 --> 01:36:26.963]  Because it does take this type of sacrifice, at least, you know, even having your name destroyed, to, you know, to knock the barbed wire down.
[01:36:26.963 --> 01:36:29.823]  To go on air first and say 9-11's an inside job.
[01:36:29.823 --> 01:36:31.764]  And be attacked by everybody.
[01:36:31.764 --> 01:36:34.905]  On the morning it happened, in two weeks before, a month before, two months before.
[01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:40.479]  But I did that.
[01:36:40.479 --> 01:36:41.740]  And I do it on every issue.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:43.520]  I come out against Obama day one.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.461]  I saw his advisors.
[01:36:44.461 --> 01:36:45.401]  I saw his policies.
[01:36:45.401 --> 01:36:46.822]  I saw what he said he was going to do.
[01:36:46.822 --> 01:36:48.602]  I said, this guy's going to lie to all of you.
[01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:48.982]  Get ready.
[01:36:48.982 --> 01:36:49.643]  Here's a film.
[01:36:49.643 --> 01:36:50.923]  Bam!
[01:36:50.923 --> 01:36:51.783]  Hit him first.
[01:36:51.783 --> 01:36:53.944]  Boom!
[01:36:53.944 --> 01:36:54.644]  Don't hold back.
[01:36:54.644 --> 01:36:58.166]  Go all the way.
[01:36:58.166 --> 01:36:59.986]  Because I don't care about being attacked.
[01:36:59.986 --> 01:37:03.067]  I don't care about being lied about.
[01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:06.869]  Now, it is more effective to prove they're lying and discredit them, and I do that where I can.
[01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:11.911]  But at my core, all I care about is delivering the payload.
[01:37:11.911 --> 01:37:13.751]  Finishing the mission.
[01:37:13.751 --> 01:37:16.792]  That's it.
[01:37:16.792 --> 01:37:26.333]  And so understand, I don't want my destruction or my setup or my death to be seen as a defeat for us.
[01:37:26.333 --> 01:37:27.834]  Certainly I don't want it to happen.
[01:37:27.834 --> 01:37:32.114]  And by the fact we're talking about this, it lessens the chance of that happening.
[01:37:32.114 --> 01:37:33.174]  They want to operate in the dark.
[01:37:33.174 --> 01:37:34.015]  We operate in the light.
[01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:35.015]  That's our power.
[01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:35.795]  Darkness is their power.
[01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:51.398]  They cheat, they lie, they don't have to follow the rules, but we got the truth on our side and that's why, even though we have to follow the rules, we're stronger than them when we stand up and fight every single time!
[01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:52.379]  So understand, folks!
[01:37:56.178 --> 01:37:57.579]  That we're having great victories.
[01:37:57.579 --> 01:37:59.580]  They're talking about the world government everywhere.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:00.680]  People are waking up.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.641]  People are talking about arresting the bankers.
[01:38:02.641 --> 01:38:05.782]  Mainstream television is talking about how this is a global takeover.
[01:38:05.782 --> 01:38:11.045]  If we identify what's happening, it will be politically impossible for them to carry it out.
[01:38:12.352 --> 01:38:17.436]  That's why they want to destroy everything economically, so we're so destitute we have to go along with them.
[01:38:17.436 --> 01:38:31.466]  But if we're there pointing out how they did that, the calamity they're bringing in financially, and the revolution they're bringing in, they're forcing one, a violent one, that will be their undoing if we preemptively beforehand explain what's going on.
[01:38:32.614 --> 01:38:33.475]  And we've done that.
[01:38:33.475 --> 01:38:34.315]  And we're going to continue.
[01:38:34.315 --> 01:38:42.340]  Every person you wake up today, every person you reach out to, every person's paradigm, you shift and open up and unblind.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:45.842]  That is one large step closer to victory, folks.
[01:38:45.842 --> 01:38:46.923]  This is history.
[01:38:46.923 --> 01:38:48.544]  This is the maximum effort.
[01:38:48.544 --> 01:38:54.267]  I want you to go to InfoWars.com and scroll down the page and right there is the Obama Deception.
[01:38:54.267 --> 01:38:54.668]  It's free.
[01:38:56.283 --> 01:38:58.825]  As free as rain, as free as the driven snow.
[01:38:58.825 --> 01:39:05.329]  Right there, that one version of hundreds, a million, two hundred thousand views, high quality for being free.
[01:39:05.329 --> 01:39:06.490]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:07.491]  Don't take it for granted.
[01:39:07.491 --> 01:39:08.431]  Keep getting it out.
[01:39:08.431 --> 01:39:09.592]  Call into every talk show.
[01:39:09.592 --> 01:39:10.833]  Plug it.
[01:39:10.833 --> 01:39:13.175]  Buy the DVD and support us at InfoWars.com.
[01:39:13.795 --> 01:39:15.496]  Make copies aggressively!
[01:39:15.496 --> 01:39:29.927]  You know what it's going to do to them if you go buy a DVD duplicator and you go buy a thousand, sell all the junk, the jet ski you don't use, whatever out of the garage, and you sit in there every day burning hundreds of copies and putting them on cars and giving them to people?
[01:39:29.927 --> 01:39:32.149]  You know what's going to happen if you do that in your sector?
[01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:33.650]  We're going to beat these people!
[01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:34.771]  We're unstoppable!
[01:39:34.771 --> 01:39:36.492]  But you've got to turn the power loose!
[01:39:37.293 --> 01:39:39.114]  You've got to stop caring what your neighbors think.
[01:39:39.114 --> 01:39:41.254]  You've got to stop caring what the government's going to do to you.
[01:39:41.254 --> 01:39:44.596]  Because the bad stuff's going to happen if you don't get up on your hind legs.
[01:39:44.596 --> 01:39:46.456]  The new order's just punching us in the face.
[01:39:46.456 --> 01:39:48.337]  Punching us and punching us and punching us.
[01:39:48.337 --> 01:39:51.178]  With propaganda and all their physical stuff and their taxes.
[01:39:51.178 --> 01:39:54.279]  It's time to get back up, at least in the Infowar, huh?
[01:39:54.279 --> 01:39:55.420]  And say, you know what?
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:57.520]  Let's see what you're made out of, huh?
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.861]  Let's turn the power loose.
[01:39:58.861 --> 01:40:00.121]  Let's turn the people loose.
[01:40:00.121 --> 01:40:03.823]  Let's see what happens to you George Soros and all you fake liberal people.
[01:40:04.818 --> 01:40:07.541]  You know, financing all these murderous revolutions all over the world.
[01:40:07.541 --> 01:40:10.023]  Let's see what happens to you neocons.
[01:40:10.023 --> 01:40:12.705]  You're going to find the police and the military are on our side.
[01:40:12.705 --> 01:40:14.046]  They're already coming over to our side.
[01:40:14.046 --> 01:40:17.469]  And let me tell you, this thing up in Pittsburgh stinks.
[01:40:17.469 --> 01:40:20.372]  The one in New York stinks now.
[01:40:20.372 --> 01:40:27.839]  I talked to government employees on and off yesterday, and it's been confirmed in the news, that helicopter was out there ten minutes before the shooting started.
[01:40:27.839 --> 01:40:30.201]  The police have been called and didn't show up.
[01:40:30.201 --> 01:40:31.122]  Another staged event.
[01:40:33.288 --> 01:40:34.289]  Do they stage events?
[01:40:34.289 --> 01:40:36.530]  Absolutely they do!
[01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:40.932]  They tell the guy, you're gonna earn some extra money, bring this here for a drill.
[01:40:40.932 --> 01:40:43.653]  They shoot the people, and leave them out there.
[01:40:43.653 --> 01:40:47.055]  Same thing Columbine, they do this stuff, and you know, people can't get their minds around that.
[01:40:47.055 --> 01:40:52.198]  It's in Operation Northwoods, how to do a mass shooting, and then blame a patsy.
[01:40:52.198 --> 01:41:00.522]  How to kill the patsy, how to have a few of your own operatives, it's always in a government building you notice, who will then say it was the guy that did the shooting.
[01:41:01.943 --> 01:41:05.327]  The police always stay outside to make sure all the witnesses die.
[01:41:05.327 --> 01:41:10.233]  They gotta go in and check the pulse and make sure that all the people that weren't part of the op die.
[01:41:10.233 --> 01:41:11.415]  This is so sick.
[01:41:11.415 --> 01:41:12.977]  And it's always the same shake and bake.
[01:41:15.506 --> 01:41:18.648]  Got you red-handed again, you bastards!
[01:41:18.648 --> 01:41:21.630]  I don't know about what's happening in the other deal.
[01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:30.335]  Looks like a spoiled brat, Marine Corps kill training, killing inhibition, taking away, throwing a fit and killing the cops, but we'll keep looking.
[01:41:30.335 --> 01:41:33.797]  The point is, if the evidence does show that, we'll cover it.
[01:41:33.797 --> 01:41:36.279]  Now, I'm going to go to your calls, I'm going to shut up.
[01:41:36.279 --> 01:41:39.361]  Just the issue here is, we are winning, we are fighting back.
[01:41:41.397 --> 01:41:45.399]  And they don't want you talking about the bankers and the corrupt government and all the horrible things they're doing.
[01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.460]  They want to demonize the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:49.721]  They want to shut down the web.
[01:41:49.721 --> 01:41:50.862]  They want to come after free speech.
[01:41:50.862 --> 01:41:51.922]  They're announcing it all.
[01:41:51.922 --> 01:41:54.864]  So let these idiots say we're lying about a New World Order.
[01:41:54.864 --> 01:41:57.525]  Let them say we're lying about vaccines killing people.
[01:41:57.525 --> 01:41:59.946]  Let them say we're lying about a North American Union.
[01:41:59.946 --> 01:42:02.067]  Let them say we're lying about a global currency.
[01:42:02.067 --> 01:42:05.509]  Let them say we're lying about the Attorney General calling for total gun ban.
[01:42:06.309 --> 01:42:14.292]  Folks are finding out they're a pack of liars, and they're losing credibility, while we gain credibility!
[01:42:14.292 --> 01:42:18.493]  The New World Order is a big thing, so they've got to write all these white papers, out of care of their ops out.
[01:42:18.493 --> 01:42:20.594]  These papers are public.
[01:42:20.594 --> 01:42:22.335]  So of course we know everything that's going to happen.
[01:42:22.335 --> 01:42:23.495]  We're reading their own roadmap.
[01:42:25.768 --> 01:42:33.630]  And so, our credibility rises, and rises, and rises, and rises, and rises, and rises, and rises, and rises, and rises!
[01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:38.631]  I'm only one person that knew history and knew the power of the individual and that I could take action.
[01:42:38.631 --> 01:42:39.732]  Look at what I've done.
[01:42:39.732 --> 01:42:45.733]  Think about what you can do if you don't get caught up in COINTELPRO and infighting and all these diversions and distractions.
[01:42:45.733 --> 01:42:48.454]  The globalists are just a few thousand, that's why they divide and conquer us.
[01:42:48.454 --> 01:42:52.995]  If you just stay on Bill of Rights, Constitution, Second Amendment, the bankers are criminals, arrest the bankers,
[01:42:53.315 --> 01:42:54.236]  In the New World Order.
[01:42:54.236 --> 01:42:55.237]  No global currency.
[01:42:55.237 --> 01:42:56.198]  Look at that Congresswoman.
[01:42:56.198 --> 01:42:58.700]  I want to get her on.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:09.189]  From Minnesota two weeks ago, as they're announcing a new global currency at the CFR, she says, I want to introduce a bill against this, and CNN came out saying she's a crazy woman.
[01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:10.070]  What is she?
[01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:12.151]  She's on screen right now at InfoWars.
[01:43:12.151 --> 01:43:13.733]  It's, let me go back here.
[01:43:17.122 --> 01:43:19.563]  Bachman on Obama's re-education camps.
[01:43:19.563 --> 01:43:21.444]  Click on that, but that's a separate article.
[01:43:21.444 --> 01:43:24.586]  They're attacking her because she's reading his bills.
[01:43:24.586 --> 01:43:25.047]  H.R.
[01:43:25.047 --> 01:43:27.928]  1444 for these youth brigades.
[01:43:27.928 --> 01:43:30.970]  She's reading how they want, in their own words, a global currency.
[01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:32.231]  And then they call her a loon.
[01:43:32.231 --> 01:43:33.251]  You can Google her name.
[01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:36.573]  You know, Google Beckman.
[01:43:36.573 --> 01:43:39.575]  Uh, you know, crazy Beckman believes in global currency.
[01:43:39.575 --> 01:43:40.975]  She's a congresswoman.
[01:43:40.975 --> 01:43:41.896]  She hears them announce it.
[01:43:41.896 --> 01:43:43.137]  She says, I'll introduce a bill.
[01:43:43.137 --> 01:43:44.517]  And they say, she's crazy!
[01:43:44.517 --> 01:43:45.298]  It doesn't exist.
[01:43:46.732 --> 01:43:48.814]  That didn't go to work, you idiots!
[01:43:48.814 --> 01:43:52.517]  You con artist!
[01:43:52.517 --> 01:43:56.220]  You know, I mean, you've lied so long, that's why you're discredited now!
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.482]  Alright, that's it, we're going to your calls.
[01:43:58.482 --> 01:44:04.346]  Tony in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:44:04.346 --> 01:44:08.590]  Tony, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:09.511]  Now let's move on there.
[01:44:09.511 --> 01:44:10.852]  Chris in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:13.530]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:18.895]  It's been about four or five years since I've called into the show.
[01:44:18.895 --> 01:44:24.279]  First, let me just say that in the last four or five years, every single thing that you've said has been absolutely right.
[01:44:24.279 --> 01:44:25.360]  I can testify to that.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.081]  I've done my homework.
[01:44:27.081 --> 01:44:30.564]  It's absolutely right, and there's just no questioning that.
[01:44:32.728 --> 01:44:43.754]  You know, I have a tendency to focus on the spiritual side of this whole thing, and I don't know if we're ever going to get a chance to take these guys down in a legal way, to string them up and put them in jail.
[01:44:43.754 --> 01:44:50.997]  On a lark, I went to David Icke's website yesterday, and something caught my eye on his page.
[01:44:50.997 --> 01:44:53.439]  He said, Do Not Riot.
[01:44:53.439 --> 01:44:55.340]  And you know, Alex, that really hit me.
[01:44:56.929 --> 01:44:58.850]  Look at what happened at the G20.
[01:44:58.850 --> 01:45:06.814]  All those people that were out there with their signs and their banners and carrying on and rioting and demonstrating, they accomplished nothing.
[01:45:06.814 --> 01:45:08.975]  They didn't accomplish a thing.
[01:45:08.975 --> 01:45:12.556]  All they did was dissipate their energy into the atmosphere and it's gone.
[01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:18.599]  The pressure went off the lid and nothing got done.
[01:45:18.599 --> 01:45:20.660]  You know, David Icke is right about that.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:21.460]  Don't riot.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.661]  We know who the enemy is.
[01:45:23.174 --> 01:45:45.384]  We know their names, we know the names of their corporations, we know where they are and who they are, and after food and water and guns and ammo in that order, the next most important thing you have, once it does hit the fan and it all breaks loose and it's, you know, Katie bar the door, the most important thing that you can own is a book of matches or a lighter.
[01:45:45.384 --> 01:45:46.245]  You know?
[01:45:46.245 --> 01:45:50.366]  I mean, you can do a lot of damage with one book of matches.
[01:45:50.366 --> 01:45:51.447]  I want your thoughts on that.
[01:45:53.206 --> 01:45:54.988]  Well, that's the whole point.
[01:45:54.988 --> 01:45:57.992]  We cannot be dominated if we have a will to fight.
[01:45:57.992 --> 01:45:59.293]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:45:59.293 --> 01:46:03.819]  Let me comment on all this right now.
[01:46:03.819 --> 01:46:08.505]  The left-controlled foundations always finance demonstrations.
[01:46:10.922 --> 01:46:21.301]  Because the media can point its camera at people dressed like clowns, they'll even pay groups to go dress like wizards and do levitations of the Mint, you know, to discredit everybody, and then they put that on the news.
[01:46:21.301 --> 01:46:23.885]  Look, these delusionals think they can levitate the Mint.
[01:46:25.111 --> 01:46:31.076]  And the Denver Post said that I was leading a demonstration that I believed I was a Jedi lifting the men.
[01:46:31.076 --> 01:46:35.239]  Now, I was there videotaping the Foundation kooks.
[01:46:35.239 --> 01:46:36.861]  They were attacking me and hitting me.
[01:46:36.861 --> 01:46:38.302]  I clearly wasn't with them.
[01:46:38.302 --> 01:46:38.942]  Doesn't matter!
[01:46:38.942 --> 01:46:40.704]  I believe I levitate men, see?
[01:46:40.704 --> 01:46:43.786]  And I said, kill Michelle Malcolm.
[01:46:43.786 --> 01:46:45.408]  But I didn't say that.
[01:46:45.408 --> 01:46:47.890]  And they had to retract it later, but nobody reads the retraction.
[01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:50.312]  So, another example of that.
[01:46:52.324 --> 01:47:01.029]  Notice there's all those news cameras, the cops stand down, three guys go up and bust the window out, they let them go in and out of the bank, they let them leave.
[01:47:01.029 --> 01:47:08.654]  But meanwhile they beat some innocent mail carrier, or newspaper carrier, delivering newspapers to death.
[01:47:08.654 --> 01:47:09.694]  This is how they operate.
[01:47:09.694 --> 01:47:15.838]  They've been caught prerogatiring all over the planet, I mean on record.
[01:47:15.838 --> 01:47:17.339]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:47:17.339 --> 01:47:19.080]  You're absolutely on target.
[01:47:20.506 --> 01:47:24.527]  When you say don't riot, notice how they're saying, there's going to be riots, riots, it's all over the newspaper every day.
[01:47:24.527 --> 01:47:28.889]  There's going to be riots, riots, and when there's riots, NORTHCOM has to come in.
[01:47:28.889 --> 01:47:32.991]  And NORTHCOM has to have martial law only for your safety.
[01:47:32.991 --> 01:47:36.252]  No, you don't want riots.
[01:47:36.252 --> 01:47:39.453]  But they know with economic collapse, it's going to lead to that.
[01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:42.054]  And then they use that to have crackdowns and greater control.
[01:47:43.769 --> 01:47:53.678]  Now, if it does turn into a Nazi Germany situation, they're arresting people, taking them to camps, taking their guns, it is your right and duty, Declaration of Independence, all the rest of it, to defend yourselves.
[01:47:53.678 --> 01:47:57.561]  And that's the real militia, the constitutional militia, all men 18 to 49.
[01:48:00.714 --> 01:48:12.459]  Not the counterfeit FBI, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center Militia, where they go out and create the Viper Militia out of a drug-dealing street gang and then set them up, or create a Klan group up in Fort Worth.
[01:48:12.459 --> 01:48:20.122]  That was in the 1998 Bumpsteer Awards, in the... It's in my film, Police Aid to the Takeover.
[01:48:20.122 --> 01:48:23.724]  It's in Texas Monthly.
[01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:28.912]  That's the fake militia we're talking about they've created, not the real militia.
[01:48:28.912 --> 01:48:35.275]  When people saw Clinton with his gun control and gun confiscation speeches on MTV, they said, we gotta form up to defend this.
[01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:38.095]  That's what the Declaration of Independence says we're supposed to do.
[01:48:38.095 --> 01:48:53.941]  But, don't let the media tie us to some white supremacist throwing a fit with mommy with his pit bulls urinating everywhere, so he throws a fit and shoots some cops in a fit of anger, and then the media tries to tie that to us that are peacefully saying, no, but we're not gonna go to FEMA camps, we're not gonna turn our guns in.
[01:48:55.652 --> 01:48:59.095]  I mean, did the people in the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi Germany have a right to fight back?
[01:48:59.095 --> 01:49:02.077]  According to the George Soros people, no.
[01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:03.538]  You do what government says.
[01:49:03.538 --> 01:49:05.880]  There is no right anywhere to throw off tyranny.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.321]  The Founding Fathers were bad.
[01:49:07.321 --> 01:49:08.843]  That's why FEMA teaches that.
[01:49:08.843 --> 01:49:22.994]  They don't want you to understand that, that yes, if they're going door-to-door taking guns, and they are taking people to FEMA camps, you have absolute authorization under God and the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and everybody, all the angels watching, to defend yourself.
[01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:38.149]  So, see, they want to keep you in this primitive, two-dimensional thinking to say, oh, look, it's bad for you to ever defend yourself, tying it to this zit-faced white supremacist who was attacking me.
[01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:40.989]  But it is true that, you know, they could take all your guns anyways.
[01:49:40.989 --> 01:49:45.910]  If the tyranny really gets bad, with a knife you can take guns from anybody and defend yourself.
[01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:48.451]  It's all about the will, the engine to resist.
[01:49:50.154 --> 01:50:03.281]  That's why they're putting in face scanning cameras and pentagon design grids and aerial blimp scanning and all the license plate readers and all of these things to lock down highways automatically because they plan to do some really horrible stuff here.
[01:50:03.281 --> 01:50:04.102]  It's their nature.
[01:50:04.102 --> 01:50:04.902]  They hate America.
[01:50:04.902 --> 01:50:05.622]  They hate freedom.
[01:50:05.622 --> 01:50:06.543]  They hate liberty.
[01:50:06.543 --> 01:50:07.443]  They are the new world order.
[01:50:07.443 --> 01:50:09.204]  They want to re-engineer this society.
[01:50:09.204 --> 01:50:10.225]  We're the big plum.
[01:50:10.225 --> 01:50:11.285]  We're the big target.
[01:50:11.285 --> 01:50:13.687]  They want to gut this place with revolution.
[01:50:13.687 --> 01:50:15.428]  Let's not have the revolution.
[01:50:15.428 --> 01:50:18.890]  What if they wanted, what if the globalists tried to put on
[01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:23.952]  A collapse of society and blood in the streets and nobody showed up.
[01:50:23.952 --> 01:50:27.314]  Well, they're going to take the few cops that get killed, the few military that get killed.
[01:50:27.314 --> 01:50:30.875]  You put enough military out at checkpoints searching cars, it's going to happen.
[01:50:30.875 --> 01:50:33.256]  It's going on everywhere.
[01:50:33.256 --> 01:50:34.497]  What if that just didn't happen?
[01:50:34.497 --> 01:50:36.798]  Well, we had the governor say no in Tennessee.
[01:50:36.798 --> 01:50:39.299]  The Army said, you know what, we're going to do it anyways this week.
[01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.881]  Well, you pressed that issue.
[01:50:41.881 --> 01:50:46.083]  You know, they're about to court-martial the troops that came out and ran checkpoints in Alabama.
[01:50:46.083 --> 01:50:46.363]  You see,
[01:50:47.642 --> 01:50:48.743]  This is an endless fight.
[01:50:48.743 --> 01:50:52.084]  It's an ongoing fight, and right now we're kicking the enemy's hind end.
[01:50:52.084 --> 01:50:54.386]  Alright, alright, I'm going to take your calls.
[01:50:54.386 --> 01:50:56.407]  Gary, Kathy, Matt, and many others, stay with us.
[01:50:56.407 --> 01:50:58.688]  We'll be right back after this quick break in FallWars.com.
[01:51:01.383 --> 01:51:11.953]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:51:11.953 --> 01:51:13.374]  Garden in a Can!

[01:51:54.116 --> 01:52:07.023]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.023 --> 01:52:12.346]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:19.376]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.376 --> 01:52:21.357]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.357 --> 01:52:23.819]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:23.819 --> 01:52:34.724]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.006 --> 01:52:38.666]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.666 --> 01:52:40.527]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.527 --> 01:52:47.449]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.449 --> 01:52:55.691]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.691 --> 01:52:57.272]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.272 --> 01:52:58.452]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.089 --> 01:53:08.335]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:53:08.335 --> 01:53:12.898]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:53:12.898 --> 01:53:17.581]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:53:17.581 --> 01:53:18.982]  It's a documented fact.
[01:53:19.162 --> 01:53:26.625]  Almost 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:53:26.625 --> 01:53:38.710]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:42.372]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:53:42.992 --> 01:53:46.116]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.

[01:53:49.861 --> 01:53:53.165]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:53:53.165 --> 01:53:53.365]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:23.264]  By the way, everybody's been waiting with bated breath to see if Keith Olbermann will come out and start attacking Barack Obama for going back on every promise.
[01:54:23.264 --> 01:54:25.564]  I know some people that know Keith Olbermann in Hollywood.
[01:54:25.564 --> 01:54:30.406]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:54:30.406 --> 01:54:32.386]  And he knows 9-11's an inside job.
[01:54:32.386 --> 01:54:33.767]  He is a liberal.
[01:54:33.767 --> 01:54:40.829]  But he is now coming out and attacking Barack Obama on the warrant with spying and continuing all the immunity claims of Bush and Cheney.
[01:54:42.301 --> 01:54:45.482]  So he is now going after Obama.
[01:54:45.482 --> 01:54:47.263]  Almost every night.
[01:54:47.263 --> 01:54:53.206]  So Keith Olbermann, I don't expect he'll be at MSNBC very long.
[01:54:53.206 --> 01:55:00.489]  Or maybe the establisher doesn't care if Obama gets destroyed politically, because they just don't care, they're just moving forward.
[01:55:00.489 --> 01:55:04.090]  They just don't care!
[01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:07.692]  Keith Olbermann's scathing criticism of Obama's security immunity claims.
[01:55:10.845 --> 01:55:19.094]  Of course, the Republicans can't really criticize any of that because Obama is continuing everything that they're doing.
[01:55:19.094 --> 01:55:22.758]  And so they're kind of like, hey, the neocons are, hey, we like Obama.
[01:55:22.758 --> 01:55:28.404]  We're going to get the Oath Keepers guy on about 15 after, because I want to go to, so call him and let him know that, please, John.
[01:55:28.404 --> 01:55:30.887]  I want to go to Gary and Kathy and Matt and Andrew and stuff before that.
[01:55:33.703 --> 01:55:35.684]  I got a bunch of other insane news here.
[01:55:35.684 --> 01:55:37.646]  Gloom grips markets brace for U.S.
[01:55:37.646 --> 01:55:39.507]  earnings season.
[01:55:39.507 --> 01:55:44.090]  Market bearer Rubini sticks to dour forecast.
[01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:46.231]  Report China auto sales surpass U.S.
[01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:47.012]  for third month.
[01:55:47.012 --> 01:55:50.834]  I mean, it's over for us, folks, unless we arrest these bankers.
[01:55:50.834 --> 01:55:52.095]  They don't care about the country.
[01:55:52.095 --> 01:55:52.656]  It's over.
[01:55:52.656 --> 01:55:54.357]  You understand?
[01:55:54.357 --> 01:55:55.497]  Unless you grow up.
[01:55:55.497 --> 01:55:57.919]  I'm talking to all the liberals and conservatives out there.
[01:55:57.919 --> 01:55:59.760]  Mortgage delinquency soar in the U.S.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:00.621]  to record levels.
[01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:07.272]  Bow to Obama's painful missteps.
[01:56:07.272 --> 01:56:08.693]  That's out of Salon.
[01:56:08.693 --> 01:56:13.495]  Yeah, I saw this video where he bows to the Saudi King.
[01:56:13.495 --> 01:56:17.116]  He also starts curtsying to the Queen, and then he's being bossed around.
[01:56:17.116 --> 01:56:18.537]  They're just like, turn around!
[01:56:18.537 --> 01:56:20.418]  And he's like, oh, I met with world leaders.
[01:56:20.418 --> 01:56:23.239]  They said, oh, do you know who they are?
[01:56:23.239 --> 01:56:25.260]  Just, just, I mean, he's there to be humiliated, folks.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:32.583]  Because the globalists are virulent racists.
[01:56:32.583 --> 01:56:35.865]  They hate black people.
[01:56:35.865 --> 01:56:42.650]  And even though Obama's 50% white and the other half 90% Arab.
[01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:44.971]  That's right, I actually pulled up his exact racial makeup.
[01:56:44.971 --> 01:56:45.451]  He's 6.3 African.
[01:56:49.843 --> 01:56:51.764]  We're making an issue of this in the new film.
[01:56:51.764 --> 01:56:54.065]  Not that it matters what color, but it's another hoax!
[01:56:54.065 --> 01:56:55.226]  He's not a black guy!
[01:56:55.226 --> 01:56:57.127]  He's not a black guy!
[01:56:57.127 --> 01:57:01.090]  I mean, I guess if you're 6.3, I mean, if I was 6.3% black, would that make me black?
[01:57:01.090 --> 01:57:01.490]  6.3 out of 100?
[01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:05.032]  He's 93 plus percent non-African.
[01:57:19.264 --> 01:57:24.287]  Now, the black genes are the strong genes in coloration, hair, and pigment.
[01:57:24.287 --> 01:57:26.489]  That's how it expresses itself.
[01:57:26.489 --> 01:57:30.572]  That is dominant in all mammal species, the pigment.
[01:57:30.572 --> 01:57:31.072]  That's it.
[01:57:31.072 --> 01:57:34.975]  So, I mean, I guess because he's got a chestnut paint job, it's over!
[01:57:34.975 --> 01:57:36.015]  It's a white guy!
[01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:44.381]  We might as well just, uh, you know, you got the pink, white people, we're not really white, we're pink, little piggy creatures, and then you got, you know, folks with a tan, and who cares?
[01:57:44.381 --> 01:57:47.083]  It's just people's pigment.
[01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:54.653]  So why don't we just put George W. Bush up there and put some brown makeup on him?
[01:57:54.653 --> 01:57:59.255]  Because Barack Obama is not black, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:59.255 --> 01:58:04.997]  Alright, before I end this hour and come back with your calls, I want to go to everybody's calls here in a second.

[01:59:08.487 --> 01:59:09.628]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.628 --> 01:59:12.871]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.501]  I'm just really wound up with a lot of info today.
[02:00:30.501 --> 02:00:31.461]  A ton of news coming up.
[02:00:31.461 --> 02:00:35.342]  Oath Keepers, bullet police and military waking up, coming up in about 15 minutes.
[02:00:35.342 --> 02:00:41.083]  And Jason Burmas debunked part two of Glenn Beck's straw man debunking on FEMA camps.
[02:00:41.083 --> 02:00:42.904]  Then Michael Bagnerik will be joining us.
[02:00:42.904 --> 02:00:45.504]  Right now, let's go to Gary in Michigan.
[02:00:45.504 --> 02:00:46.545]  Gary, thanks for holding her.
[02:00:46.545 --> 02:00:47.285]  A trooper, go ahead.
[02:00:47.845 --> 02:00:50.827]  Hi Alex, excuse me, thank you for taking my call.
[02:00:50.827 --> 02:00:51.927]  I've been right in your office.
[02:00:51.927 --> 02:00:59.771]  I'm the three-time ex-convict loser that says that you and your friends are duped with language and you're still in the Matrix, buddy.
[02:00:59.771 --> 02:01:04.634]  I don't know what that means about you being an ex-convict that's been in my office, but I appreciate your call, Gary.
[02:01:04.634 --> 02:01:06.334]  Good to hear from you.
[02:01:06.334 --> 02:01:10.617]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I mean, I've got to understand you to have you on air.
[02:01:10.617 --> 02:01:13.918]  Let's talk to Kathy in New Orleans.
[02:01:13.918 --> 02:01:14.839]  Kathy, you're on the air.
[02:01:15.592 --> 02:01:16.972]  Hi, how are you?
[02:01:16.972 --> 02:01:18.593]  Thank you for everything that you do.
[02:01:18.593 --> 02:01:22.674]  I met you along with Gary King in September.
[02:01:22.674 --> 02:01:28.136]  You actually gave him a copy of Loose Change second edition for his birthday.
[02:01:28.136 --> 02:01:30.737]  We were camped out in front.
[02:01:30.737 --> 02:01:37.459]  We wanted to interview you and you greatly gave us some information for his radio show.
[02:01:38.166 --> 02:01:40.567]  Oh yeah, that's a separate Gary from the guy that just called up.
[02:01:40.567 --> 02:01:43.007]  Yeah, I remember you were... Right.
[02:01:43.007 --> 02:01:48.008]  And listening to my show, he went and got a local radio show in New Orleans that's now very popular.
[02:01:48.008 --> 02:01:53.809]  It's very popular, and thanks to you, and we listen to you every single day.
[02:01:53.809 --> 02:02:02.771]  I did want to tell you that tomorrow he is uncovering... I mean, I'm a little nervous about him because he says it like it is.
[02:02:02.771 --> 02:02:06.612]  He tells everybody exactly what he learned from you.
[02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:18.839]  And they actually, he and one of his researchers, uncovered in a job search from Virginia to hire chemtrail pilots.
[02:02:20.799 --> 02:02:21.580]  That is huge.
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:25.663]  Why don't you send us an email on that or make sure I get the report when you do it.
[02:02:25.663 --> 02:02:26.784]  You know, here's the deal.
[02:02:26.784 --> 02:02:30.868]  I want to make a film on chemtrails because it's hidden in plain view.
[02:02:30.868 --> 02:02:37.573]  Listeners discovered hundreds of universities worldwide being given UN and US Department of Energy funds
[02:02:38.334 --> 02:02:45.637]  They say to spray sunscreen for the Earth's atmosphere by mixing stuff with jet fuel and that they're doing it.
[02:02:45.637 --> 02:02:48.719]  Paul Watson wrote the article and it got almost no attention.
[02:02:48.719 --> 02:02:53.261]  I mean, here are chemtrails admitted and documented, but I don't want to wait on this.
[02:02:54.442 --> 02:03:07.883]  What you need to have, and I'm familiar with the show, I now see him at events, doing interviews, why don't you have Gary call my producer right now, email us the job search, let me look at it, we'll have Gary on, and we'll break it here at the end of the show today.
[02:03:07.883 --> 02:03:08.484]  Is Gary around?
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:12.762]  I know he's listening to me right now.
[02:03:12.762 --> 02:03:13.162]  I'll call him.
[02:03:13.162 --> 02:03:17.765]  I know he's given us his card many times and I don't know if we've ever put it in our database.
[02:03:17.765 --> 02:03:22.928]  It's actually going to come on tomorrow and it's just huge.
[02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:24.029]  He's going to come on tomorrow?
[02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:26.350]  You mean he's not going to come on my show?
[02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:27.511]  No, I mean, yeah, he would.
[02:03:27.511 --> 02:03:30.152]  But what I'm saying, he would love to.
[02:03:30.152 --> 02:03:35.996]  He's going to jolt it out on New Orleans News tomorrow morning.
[02:03:35.996 --> 02:03:38.017]  So he has a researcher, Devorah.
[02:03:38.656 --> 02:03:40.278]  And she came up with this.
[02:03:59.855 --> 02:04:04.057]  Bid for three one million man camps for the American people.
[02:04:04.057 --> 02:04:06.958]  And then Ruddy, Christopher Ruddy wrote the article and people couldn't believe it.
[02:04:06.958 --> 02:04:09.919]  And he wrote another article going, yes folks, the camps are real.
[02:04:09.919 --> 02:04:11.900]  And then in 2006, another report came out.
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:12.240]  Come on in.
[02:04:14.426 --> 02:04:18.771]  Uh, it's AP Newsbreak, uh, Obama looks at climate engineering.
[02:04:18.771 --> 02:04:25.658]  So see, now they're announcing, he just ran in at the very time you called, ma'am, he just ran in with AP, admitting they're chemtrailing us.
[02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:29.482]  My God, the level of this, I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:04:29.482 --> 02:04:33.967]  The level of the insanity as they admit everything, these bastards.
[02:04:33.967 --> 02:04:34.788]  Hey, listen, um,
[02:04:35.769 --> 02:04:37.809]  I'm aware of Gary's good reporting.
[02:04:37.809 --> 02:04:43.211]  Let me put you on hold, and I'm going to have John Harmon up at Minnesota give you the back line.
[02:04:43.211 --> 02:04:45.151]  Have Gary call in right now.
[02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:49.472]  I need to check the order on this, and I want to see it.
[02:04:49.472 --> 02:04:53.453]  You know, that is check the bid order put out.
[02:04:53.453 --> 02:04:58.554]  And then I'd like to have him break this with us right here on air right now, and then he can do it on New Orleans tomorrow.
[02:04:58.554 --> 02:04:59.234]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.448 --> 02:05:03.911]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[02:05:03.911 --> 02:05:07.715]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:05:07.715 --> 02:05:10.539]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:05:10.539 --> 02:05:17.747]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:05:17.867 --> 02:05:18.488]  We're good to go!
[02:05:34.327 --> 02:05:38.471]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:05:38.471 --> 02:05:43.575]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:05:43.575 --> 02:05:49.320]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:53.783]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:05:53.783 --> 02:05:56.446]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[02:05:56.446 --> 02:05:56.906]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:06:01.914 --> 02:06:07.154]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.942 --> 02:06:13.826]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.826 --> 02:06:20.330]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:22.291]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.291 --> 02:06:24.752]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:06:24.752 --> 02:06:35.659]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.947 --> 02:06:39.607]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.607 --> 02:06:41.468]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:06:41.468 --> 02:06:48.370]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.370 --> 02:06:56.632]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.632 --> 02:06:58.213]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.213 --> 02:06:59.393]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:04.804]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:07:04.804 --> 02:07:09.048]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:07:09.048 --> 02:07:17.016]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:17.716]  We're good to go!
[02:07:50.251 --> 02:07:50.772]  I think so.
[02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:07.351]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.351 --> 02:08:09.132]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.132 --> 02:08:10.894]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.894 --> 02:08:12.475]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.475 --> 02:08:13.415]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.415 --> 02:08:18.219]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.219 --> 02:08:23.843]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.843 --> 02:08:29.247]  We have a Chemtrail guest with Chemtrail Watch on the show tomorrow.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:33.322]  Chemtrails are real.
[02:08:33.322 --> 02:08:47.214]  Until 1996, all condensation ice crystal trails only formed at 20,000 feet and higher, generally in the winter months, and they faded out in a few seconds to the maximum of one minute.
[02:08:47.214 --> 02:08:48.095]  Your whole life, remember?
[02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:52.338]  Watching a trail go by and watching it disappear.
[02:08:52.338 --> 02:08:53.099]  Then suddenly in 96,
[02:08:55.342 --> 02:08:59.285]  Before anybody was even talking about chemtrails, I would notice, man, why do those stay there?
[02:08:59.285 --> 02:09:01.407]  I'd be, you know, gardening.
[02:09:01.407 --> 02:09:03.849]  If my parents had a couple acres in the middle of town, I would go garden.
[02:09:05.259 --> 02:09:06.540]  I like planting stuff.
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:08.041]  Call me a weirdo.
[02:09:08.041 --> 02:09:13.063]  But I'd be out there growing watermelons and stuff and stomping around and the flowers and the bees.
[02:09:13.063 --> 02:09:16.925]  And I'd go, man, that trail's been up there for like an hour and it's getting bigger, turning into a cloud.
[02:09:16.925 --> 02:09:17.485]  What's going on?
[02:09:17.485 --> 02:09:18.826]  It's like cloud seeding.
[02:09:18.826 --> 02:09:21.247]  And then by 97, chemtrails, chemtrails.
[02:09:21.247 --> 02:09:23.469]  And they add it to the jet fuel so it's compartmentalized.
[02:09:23.469 --> 02:09:24.889]  The pilots don't even know.
[02:09:24.889 --> 02:09:29.472]  And they have some others where they do know and they're spraying off larger amounts.
[02:09:32.219 --> 02:09:41.441]  And then suddenly government textbooks started admitting three years ago that they really were spraying the atmosphere to save us from the sun's rays and to fix the ozone layer.
[02:09:41.441 --> 02:09:58.425]  And Paul Watson, I tried to Google it during the break, he wrote a big article six months ago or so, where the government admitted the chemtrails, and we had links to the government admitting, yes, we've got thousands of flights a year, we're spraying the atmosphere, testing, terraforming to save the Earth from global warming.
[02:09:59.665 --> 02:10:07.429]  And then NASA admitted a few years ago that the Earth is 20% darker now than it was before the 1995.
[02:10:07.429 --> 02:10:15.333]  And then you show the satellite photos of the chemtrail sprays everywhere, how all the lines, like spiderwebs, cover up cities.
[02:10:15.333 --> 02:10:18.295]  I mean, they are manipulating the planet.
[02:10:18.295 --> 02:10:19.875]  Well, here's Associated Press.
[02:10:19.875 --> 02:10:21.656]  AP exists.
[02:10:21.656 --> 02:10:25.298]  You know, it looks like when AP announces they're setting up global government and global currency.
[02:10:25.298 --> 02:10:27.499]  I get attacked and they say, no, it doesn't exist.
[02:10:27.499 --> 02:10:28.340]  I mean, literally.
[02:10:29.659 --> 02:10:34.541]  Now, this is AP, and we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv now, right?
[02:10:34.541 --> 02:10:35.061]  We are live.
[02:10:35.061 --> 02:10:36.882]  Okay, we went live at 8 after.
[02:10:36.882 --> 02:10:39.403]  I'm in front of the camera so much I don't even know anymore.
[02:10:39.403 --> 02:10:41.664]  AP, news break.
[02:10:41.664 --> 02:10:44.385]  Obama looks at climate engineering.
[02:10:44.385 --> 02:10:46.586]  Now, I want Paul Watson on this now.
[02:10:46.586 --> 02:10:49.367]  I want chemtrail every day.
[02:10:49.367 --> 02:10:52.168]  In fact, when I'm done with this next Obama film, I'm doing a chemtrail film.
[02:10:52.168 --> 02:10:53.529]  That said, I've made my mind up.
[02:10:53.529 --> 02:10:57.551]  I was going to make the 2012 film explaining how that's all a big globalist hoax.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:00.742]  But that can wait.
[02:11:00.742 --> 02:11:05.805]  I need everybody to start sending me your chemtrail footage and we'll give you full credit and everything from all over the country.
[02:11:05.805 --> 02:11:07.046]  Just send your chemtrail footage.
[02:11:07.046 --> 02:11:08.027]  I'm making a chemtrail film.
[02:11:08.027 --> 02:11:08.447]  That's it.
[02:11:08.447 --> 02:11:10.449]  Because it's in.
[02:11:10.449 --> 02:11:18.035]  I should have made it a year ago when they were admitting it in textbooks and things because it really hurts the globals to make a film and have them deny it and then have it be all admitted.
[02:11:18.035 --> 02:11:21.758]  But even when I document what's admitted now, they're going to say it doesn't exist.
[02:11:22.358 --> 02:11:29.520]  The President's new science advisor said Wednesday that global warming is so dire, the Obama administration is discussing radical technologies to cool the Earth's air.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.101]  See, this is in the University reports Paul's report on.
[02:11:32.101 --> 02:11:40.364]  Oh, we're spraying the atmosphere, testing, shouldering the Earth, and kids' textbooks that have chapters saying New World Order say, oh, and we're spraying you.
[02:11:40.364 --> 02:11:42.085]  Those are that sunscreen spray.
[02:11:43.157 --> 02:11:45.378]  So, Paul Watson is now up on air.
[02:11:45.378 --> 02:11:47.058]  We're multitasking on air.
[02:11:47.058 --> 02:11:54.320]  Paul Watson, my chief researcher and writer, I have you here with a new mission, should you choose to accept it.
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:55.081]  Are you there, my friend?
[02:11:55.081 --> 02:11:57.561]  Yes, Alex.
[02:11:57.561 --> 02:12:01.703]  I need you to do an article saying, yes, they are terraforming the planet.
[02:12:01.703 --> 02:12:02.803]  Chemtrails are real.
[02:12:02.803 --> 02:12:05.164]  Now, only one component is the terraforming.
[02:12:05.164 --> 02:12:08.885]  They're also spraying poisons on you that sterilize you and brain damage you and
[02:12:09.764 --> 02:12:11.085]  I know you don't want to admit that in public.
[02:12:11.085 --> 02:12:12.927]  It's because you've been brain damaged.
[02:12:12.927 --> 02:12:14.848]  Myself included, but I'm fighting through it.
[02:12:14.848 --> 02:12:18.812]  You can still focus and get some neurons firing there.
[02:12:18.812 --> 02:12:21.934]  We're trying.
[02:12:21.934 --> 02:12:29.520]  John Holdren told the AP, the first interview since becoming confirmed last month, that the idea of geoengineering the climate is being discussed.
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.022]  One such extreme option includes shooting
[02:12:32.998 --> 02:12:36.142]  Pollution particles in the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays.
[02:12:36.142 --> 02:12:39.786]  Holdren said such an experiment measure would only be used as last resort.
[02:12:39.786 --> 02:12:41.188]  It's already going on globally.
[02:12:41.188 --> 02:12:43.771]  The operation was launched worldwide in 1996.
[02:12:43.771 --> 02:12:44.552]  Worldwide terraforming!
[02:12:48.939 --> 02:12:52.400]  With deadly barium salts and aluminum dioxide.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.500]  As now people 22 years old are getting Alzheimer's everywhere.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.601]  Just breathing it.
[02:12:57.601 --> 02:12:58.381]  Mass death.
[02:12:58.381 --> 02:12:59.361]  Brain plaques.
[02:12:59.361 --> 02:12:59.781]  Hitting us.
[02:12:59.781 --> 02:13:00.541]  Hitting us hard.
[02:13:00.541 --> 02:13:03.322]  I mean, the globalists have special detoxes they do that can remove some of it.
[02:13:03.322 --> 02:13:04.222]  But they're even insane.
[02:13:04.222 --> 02:13:05.102]  It's hurting them.
[02:13:05.102 --> 02:13:09.143]  I mean, this is mega attack total and AP!
[02:13:09.143 --> 02:13:16.064]  And I've got FBI calling the office and circling the office and revocateurs out the wazoo and people attacking everywhere.
[02:13:16.784 --> 02:13:21.286]  And I mean, and I'm the weirdo, because, no, listen, I'm breaking people out of their trance.
[02:13:21.286 --> 02:13:23.147]  See, I'm broken out of the trance.
[02:13:23.147 --> 02:13:25.708]  I'm angry, I'm freaked out, I'm going, my God, they're terraforming!
[02:13:25.708 --> 02:13:27.609]  My God, sodium fluoride in the water!
[02:13:27.609 --> 02:13:29.510]  My God, they funded Hitler!
[02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:32.451]  My, you know, I am, I understand what's going on!
[02:13:32.451 --> 02:13:35.312]  I read their eugenics documents!
[02:13:35.312 --> 02:13:39.074]  The Herald in the back of my neck standing up right now, I want to warn you, they should all arrest them!
[02:13:39.074 --> 02:13:40.434]  Arrest the bankers!
[02:13:40.434 --> 02:13:42.895]  They're robbing, God, I can't believe it!
[02:13:42.895 --> 02:13:43.636]  And then they admit,
[02:13:44.773 --> 02:13:47.595]  This is just like after they've been spying on us without warrants for decades.
[02:13:47.595 --> 02:13:49.836]  They come out and say, we might do a little spying without warrants.
[02:13:49.836 --> 02:13:51.998]  We want to pass a law now.
[02:13:51.998 --> 02:13:55.360]  Or, oh, we want a global currency.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:14:02.384]  We want to pass a law when they've already been having it for years at the monetary level.
[02:14:02.384 --> 02:14:03.045]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:14:03.045 --> 02:14:10.009]  Paul, Paul, I just, I just can't believe they're, they're admitting it all, man.
[02:14:10.009 --> 02:14:10.689]  They're admitting it.
[02:14:12.267 --> 02:14:14.669]  And when they start admitting stuff, it means they're going full steam ahead.
[02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:17.471]  Watson, what do you think of this?
[02:14:17.471 --> 02:14:21.894]  Well, yeah, I wrote two articles on this last year.
[02:14:21.894 --> 02:14:28.799]  One was Government Scientist Proposed Geoengineering Earth's Upper Atmosphere.
[02:14:28.799 --> 02:14:36.445]  And this was about documents that were obtained by Cybercast News Service from the U.S.
[02:14:36.445 --> 02:14:40.608]  Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory.
[02:14:41.281 --> 02:14:44.422]  In Aiken, South Carolina.
[02:14:44.422 --> 02:14:45.723]  But that's not the key!
[02:14:45.723 --> 02:14:47.123]  That's not the key!
[02:14:47.123 --> 02:14:54.986]  You found, we found, thanks to listeners, thousands of university reports how they're already spraying under the Department of Energy.
[02:14:54.986 --> 02:15:05.369]  Well, this one was about conducting tests about firing at what would happen if a huge amount of particulate matter is shot into the stratosphere, that's the quote.
[02:15:05.725 --> 02:15:15.193]  And then they say they're testing, that's right, all of this spraying, like HIV is a weaker virus to the real, when they're gonna release, it's a beta test.
[02:15:15.193 --> 02:15:22.600]  But yes, but they admit thousands of ongoing tests with mixing it with a jet fuel, spraying the particulates into the atmosphere.
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:24.001]  I mean, that's what they're doing!
[02:15:24.001 --> 02:15:25.803]  That's why you see it's real!
[02:15:25.803 --> 02:15:29.186]  It's in the Associated Press, I keep telling you!
[02:15:29.186 --> 02:15:29.646]  Oh God.
[02:15:29.646 --> 02:15:30.947]  Oh God.
[02:15:32.262 --> 02:16:00.875]  An article out of the Guardian called Geoengineering the Radical Ideas to Combat Global Warming, where Ken Calvera, who's at the Carnegie Institution in Stanford, California, promoted injecting the atmosphere with aerosols, as well as sulphur, which in this article, we list the health effects, the adverse health effects of exposure to sulphur,
[02:16:01.846 --> 02:16:09.490]  Neurological effects and behavioral changes, disturbance of blood circulation, heart damage, effects on eyes and eyesight.
[02:16:09.490 --> 02:16:14.093]  Look, what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing is saying, we're going to medicate you.
[02:16:15.632 --> 02:16:21.035]  And, you know, that's why I always say, oh, they're spraying the town for a deadly moth this week, and I pulled up at 3 a.m.
[02:16:21.035 --> 02:16:33.761]  one morning and saw a Cessna fly over with spray tanks spraying, and I was like, ugh, like 200 feet off the ground right over my house, spraying, and I stood outside smoking a cigarette before I quit smoking and smelled the pesticide coming down.
[02:16:33.761 --> 02:16:35.362]  I mean, do you see how they do it?
[02:16:35.362 --> 02:16:36.942]  They just set the precedent.
[02:16:36.942 --> 02:16:40.724]  Oh, yeah, we're going to be geoengineering, terraforming the planet now.
[02:16:40.724 --> 02:16:41.464]  It's no big deal.
[02:16:41.464 --> 02:16:42.065]  Go back to sleep.
[02:16:42.705 --> 02:16:44.766]  Watson, but what was the term?
[02:16:44.766 --> 02:16:47.067]  The High Altitude Aerial Spring?
[02:16:47.067 --> 02:16:48.548]  What's the scientific term for it?
[02:16:48.548 --> 02:16:54.211]  If people Google it, they'll find thousands of reports.
[02:16:54.211 --> 02:16:55.592]  Something like that, yeah.
[02:16:55.592 --> 02:16:58.994]  The articles I wrote were about the... No, no, no, no.
[02:16:58.994 --> 02:17:01.916]  You wrote another one about that.
[02:17:01.916 --> 02:17:03.857]  You've written more articles than you remember.
[02:17:03.857 --> 02:17:09.780]  The one I wrote was entitled, Secret Geoengineering Projects Threaten Unknown Environmental Dangers.
[02:17:11.195 --> 02:17:15.697]  Which is the, uh, comprehensive article, which has got everything in it.
[02:17:15.697 --> 02:17:19.199]  Hey, hey, listen, it's like there's some collective amnesia on this.
[02:17:19.199 --> 02:17:20.960]  I've been begging for big reports on this.
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:22.941]  You did a separate report on this.
[02:17:22.941 --> 02:17:25.183]  We need hard-hitting reports to get people's attention.
[02:17:25.183 --> 02:17:27.484]  You always have scientific names to them and people don't read them.
[02:17:27.484 --> 02:17:28.645]  Let's bring John Harmon on.
[02:17:28.645 --> 02:17:30.105]  He remembers.
[02:17:30.105 --> 02:17:33.267]  John Harmon, come on here.
[02:17:33.267 --> 02:17:34.968]  Are you on air right now?
[02:17:34.968 --> 02:17:36.109]  Hey, tell folks the name of it.
[02:17:36.109 --> 02:17:36.609]  You got it right.
[02:17:43.462 --> 02:17:48.966]  Yeah, it's Indirect Direct Aerosol Spraying Campaign, that's right.
[02:17:48.966 --> 02:17:51.207]  Remember that now, Paul?
[02:17:51.207 --> 02:17:52.929]  Yeah.
[02:17:52.929 --> 02:17:55.931]  I need a master story that has it all so folks get it.
[02:17:57.316 --> 02:18:00.218]  Because, again, they are manipulating the atmosphere.
[02:18:00.218 --> 02:18:01.538]  These people are playing God.
[02:18:01.538 --> 02:18:03.299]  They are out of their minds.
[02:18:03.299 --> 02:18:08.561]  Remember, they thought that when they detonated hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere, it would catch the Earth on fire.
[02:18:08.561 --> 02:18:15.564]  This is on Discovery Channel on the show Trinity, voiced by William Shatner, but first aired on HBO.
[02:18:15.564 --> 02:18:16.405]  And they brag.
[02:18:16.405 --> 02:18:19.006]  If you watch that movie, get it on Netflix, folks.
[02:18:20.421 --> 02:18:21.562]  Called Trinity.
[02:18:21.562 --> 02:18:29.431]  That they detonated in one night 50-something high-powered hydrogen bombs trying to set the atmosphere on fire.
[02:18:29.431 --> 02:18:32.274]  Gee, this might set the atmosphere on fire!
[02:18:32.274 --> 02:18:34.476]  Let's try to set the atmosphere on fire!
[02:18:35.697 --> 02:18:38.339]  God, these people are psycho demons!
[02:18:38.339 --> 02:18:46.647]  Watson, I've got another guest coming up, but I want a big report later into the fourth hour on this.
[02:18:46.647 --> 02:18:50.571]  Can you get the AP up with them admitting they're going to terraform the planet with Ariel Spring?
[02:18:50.571 --> 02:18:52.232]  It's already posted.
[02:18:52.232 --> 02:18:56.416]  It's at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:18:56.416 --> 02:18:59.879]  Well, our rewrite of it is.
[02:18:59.879 --> 02:19:01.421]  With the link to the AP, yeah.
[02:19:02.884 --> 02:19:07.870]  Alright, RxP, I want a master article detailing the people.
[02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:09.292]  Oh God, help us.
[02:19:09.292 --> 02:19:10.834]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:19:10.834 --> 02:19:12.516]  As well as that, Alex.
[02:19:12.516 --> 02:19:16.080]  One third of fish in British rivers are completely feminized.
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:19.084]  I mean, what on earth have they put in the rivers now?
[02:19:19.943 --> 02:19:25.370]  And that's been linked with declining sperm counts in men as well for the past 20 or so years.
[02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:29.435]  Yeah, it was 85% down, now it's 95% down, the sperm.
[02:19:29.435 --> 02:19:38.245]  Well, I mean, and they've also done studies on waterways that aren't connected to any sewage system and shouldn't have the estrogen added, and they're finding it's synthetic.
[02:19:38.245 --> 02:19:38.926]  They're dumping
[02:19:39.847 --> 02:19:41.588]  Masses of amounts of it into the whole environment.
[02:19:41.588 --> 02:19:45.230]  They're spraying us with barium salts, sodium fluoride in our water.
[02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:47.130]  You put a fish in and it dies.
[02:19:47.130 --> 02:19:49.752]  They're, they're, look, look, I mean, it's over.
[02:19:49.752 --> 02:19:53.213]  We're being mass murdered by Nazi criminals that run everything.
[02:19:53.213 --> 02:19:57.115]  And meanwhile, they have all these newspapers attacking me because I'm exposing them.
[02:19:57.115 --> 02:19:59.296]  Watson, I want a masterpiece on this.
[02:19:59.296 --> 02:20:00.617]  I want to expose these bastards.
[02:20:00.617 --> 02:20:00.997]  Stay with me.
[02:20:02.421 --> 02:20:07.925]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[02:20:07.925 --> 02:20:10.946]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[02:20:10.946 --> 02:20:16.350]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[02:20:17.165 --> 02:20:20.807]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[02:20:20.807 --> 02:20:22.108]  We have been warned.
[02:20:22.108 --> 02:20:29.133]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[02:20:29.133 --> 02:20:32.314]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[02:20:32.314 --> 02:20:32.755]  Why?
[02:20:32.755 --> 02:20:36.757]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[02:20:36.757 --> 02:20:37.938]  Supplies are running low.
[02:20:38.298 --> 02:20:44.805]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[02:20:44.805 --> 02:20:48.709]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[02:20:48.709 --> 02:20:51.172]  Go to YourFoodStorage.com.
[02:20:51.172 --> 02:20:52.954]  That's YourFoodStorage.com.
[02:20:52.954 --> 02:20:53.855]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[02:20:53.855 --> 02:20:54.515]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[02:21:01.736 --> 02:21:07.558]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.558 --> 02:21:14.561]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.131 --> 02:21:21.714]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.714 --> 02:21:23.695]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.695 --> 02:21:26.197]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.197 --> 02:21:37.762]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.762 --> 02:21:39.443]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.443 --> 02:21:40.804]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.289 --> 02:21:48.192]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.192 --> 02:21:56.456]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.456 --> 02:21:58.037]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.037 --> 02:22:01.619]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.619 --> 02:22:04.300]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[02:22:04.724 --> 02:22:11.746]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[02:22:11.746 --> 02:22:16.547]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[02:22:16.547 --> 02:22:26.089]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[02:22:26.536 --> 02:22:36.604]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[02:22:36.604 --> 02:22:40.227]  Call me Dwayne Dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[02:22:44.505 --> 02:22:47.926]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[02:22:47.926 --> 02:22:50.687]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[02:22:50.687 --> 02:22:56.410]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:06.211]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[02:23:06.211 --> 02:23:14.893]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:23:14.893 --> 02:23:18.474]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:23:18.474 --> 02:23:21.694]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[02:23:21.694 --> 02:23:24.195]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:27.175]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.
[02:23:27.175 --> 02:23:29.936]  Visit tubienatural.com and order today!
[02:23:30.316 --> 02:23:30.756]  We're good.
[02:23:46.289 --> 02:23:47.590]  He's going the distance!
[02:24:26.328 --> 02:24:28.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, the chemtrails are real.
[02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:40.981]  Just like they would deny there was a government plan to microchip the kids, and then Time Magazine and Newsweek for kids, they give them free in public schools say, oh, you're cool, you're not like your parents, you're not backwards, you're gonna take the chip.
[02:24:40.981 --> 02:24:43.343]  That's a quote, by the way, from Time Magazine for kids.
[02:24:44.665 --> 02:24:47.367]  Oh yeah, turning your kids against you.
[02:24:47.367 --> 02:24:49.829]  And now the Mexican Attorney General has made his employees take it.
[02:24:49.829 --> 02:24:51.350]  They're pushing it on Alzheimer's patients.
[02:24:51.350 --> 02:24:53.371]  The point is, they brainwashed the kids first.
[02:24:53.371 --> 02:24:58.114]  There's a bunch of government textbooks and others that admit they're chemtrail spring.
[02:24:58.114 --> 02:25:03.938]  Now, we found all the government documents where they admit they're already terraforming the atmosphere since 96.
[02:25:03.938 --> 02:25:05.139]  Guess what?
[02:25:05.139 --> 02:25:06.360]  When we found out the term,
[02:25:08.422 --> 02:25:11.043]  Indirect and direct aerosol spray campaign.
[02:25:11.043 --> 02:25:19.786]  You just Google that, you'll be on Department of Energy, British Department of Energy, and I hate to have my guests waiting and then going off, and this is just too big.
[02:25:19.786 --> 02:25:32.691]  And then the last few months they had a London Guardian and AP come out and say, oh, they're looking at spraying barium salts, and they can mix it with the jet fuel, that way it's cheaply done, and it'll have a big effect over the airwaves to protect our cities.
[02:25:32.691 --> 02:25:33.872]  They're already doing it!
[02:25:36.690 --> 02:25:42.173]  And NASA reports the planet's twenty percent darker than it was back in the early nineties.
[02:25:42.173 --> 02:25:43.694]  They are spraying!
[02:25:43.694 --> 02:25:44.855]  Then they turn into clouds.
[02:25:44.855 --> 02:25:46.696]  It's cloud seeding.
[02:25:46.696 --> 02:25:50.738]  We broke Ben Livingston.
[02:25:50.738 --> 02:25:53.440]  We broke that story before Fox, AP, any of them.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:56.762]  A listener sent us the declassified document that the government had put out.
[02:25:56.762 --> 02:26:01.405]  It had been forty-something years, so they declassified it.
[02:26:01.405 --> 02:26:03.346]  And in the declassified government document,
[02:26:04.369 --> 02:26:11.712]  He talked about how he created hurricanes, killed hurricanes, weakened hurricanes, how with just a few airplanes they could do this.
[02:26:11.712 --> 02:26:12.613]  He ran the attacks.
[02:26:12.613 --> 02:26:15.194]  He would lead the squadrons in.
[02:26:15.194 --> 02:26:19.056]  He was a combat pilot before that in Korea.
[02:26:19.056 --> 02:26:20.016]  Amazing guy.
[02:26:20.016 --> 02:26:23.318]  He would lead the combat squadrons into Vietnam with no clouds.
[02:26:23.318 --> 02:26:25.599]  They would rain 10 feet of water on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[02:26:28.539 --> 02:26:31.341]  And he interviewed us and then he got threatened and he won't come on anymore.
[02:26:31.341 --> 02:26:38.845]  He said, no, I've been basically threatened, I can't come back on your show, Mr. Jones, because we got him on, it broke, and then AP and everybody picked it up.
[02:26:38.845 --> 02:26:50.771]  But the issue is that this is barium salts, aluminum dioxide, these are nuclei, what forms clouds.
[02:26:50.771 --> 02:26:55.114]  And now AP, you know, I apologize to Stuart Rhodes, but
[02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:58.348]  I bet he got a big response the last time he was on from Oath Keepers.
[02:26:58.348 --> 02:27:03.530]  They're having a big move to get even more people out to take the oath against firing on U.S.
[02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:06.972]  citizens, confiscating guns, doing things like that.
[02:27:06.972 --> 02:27:15.316]  But side issue, Stuart, what do you think of them openly announcing they're terraforming the planet?
[02:27:15.316 --> 02:27:18.937]  I just came on and I just caught the tail end of your discussion about that.
[02:27:18.937 --> 02:27:20.678]  That's pretty amazing.
[02:27:20.678 --> 02:27:24.680]  So, off the deferential, I listened to the rest of what you said.
[02:27:25.285 --> 02:27:30.189]  Alright, well we're going to come back to you and give you some time to talk and I want to have you back up for a full hour in the near future after this happens.
[02:27:30.189 --> 02:27:31.930]  In a nutshell, tell us about Oath Keepers.
[02:27:31.930 --> 02:27:34.192]  Very exciting.
[02:27:34.192 --> 02:27:40.957]  So the police and military uphold their oath and don't go to war with the people, which will also be very healthy for them.
[02:27:41.846 --> 02:27:42.367]  Absolutely.
[02:27:42.367 --> 02:27:48.896]  This is our mission, as I told you last time, is to make sure that the big guns are on our side.
[02:27:48.896 --> 02:27:50.358]  And the response has been amazing.
[02:27:50.358 --> 02:27:58.770]  What they want listeners to know about us is we are rallying on the Lexington Green on April 19th, which is the anniversary of the first shot.
[02:27:59.310 --> 02:27:59.810]  What day is that?
[02:28:28.018 --> 02:28:32.342]  Ah, 1775, baby, that's when it all started.
[02:28:32.342 --> 02:28:41.669]  That's right, April 19, 1775 is when under Marshall Law, General Gage, he sent out his regulars to go confiscate the cannon and the bowder at Concord.
[02:28:41.669 --> 02:28:49.996]  And on the way in Lexington, Captain Parker and the Lexington Massachusetts militia mustered on the green in face of the British.
[02:28:49.996 --> 02:28:51.437]  That's where they had the first shots fired.
[02:28:52.077 --> 02:28:52.617]  I just had a vision.
[02:28:52.617 --> 02:28:55.018]  I've got to stop shooting by the end of April for my new Obama film.
[02:28:55.018 --> 02:28:58.339]  I'm going to send a camera crew and show this event at the end of the film about this being the solution.
[02:29:13.064 --> 02:29:13.765]  Absolutely won't.
[02:29:13.765 --> 02:29:15.447]  You need to be there, Alex.
[02:29:15.447 --> 02:29:17.150]  You're going to regret not being there if you're not there.
[02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:20.454]  I know, but I mean, literally, sir, I have enemy forces circling me.
[02:29:20.454 --> 02:29:21.596]  I'm here in the command base.
[02:29:21.596 --> 02:29:24.280]  I've got to stay here in the headquarters.
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:26.022]  OK, well, we'll definitely do that.
[02:29:26.022 --> 02:29:27.745]  You know what?
[02:29:27.745 --> 02:29:29.026]  I mean, I'd love to fly up there.
[02:29:29.026 --> 02:29:29.707]  It's just literally...
[02:29:30.888 --> 02:29:31.588]  Here's the issue.
[02:29:31.588 --> 02:29:33.910]  I could do 20 radio interviews a day on other people's shows.
[02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:36.071]  I mean, I'm reaching millions a day on my own shows.
[02:29:36.071 --> 02:29:42.455]  The problem is, believe me, I'd rather travel around and be part of this, but I can't be in all places at one time.
[02:29:42.455 --> 02:29:51.961]  I've got to kind of, you know, sit here at Midas Tareth, like we said last time, and I'm looking off at the eye across the mountain range at me.
[02:29:51.961 --> 02:29:53.342]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.342 --> 02:29:55.863]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.863 --> 02:29:58.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.457 --> 02:30:03.139]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:30:03.139 --> 02:30:04.880]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:07.563]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:30:07.563 --> 02:30:12.708]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[02:31:20.464 --> 02:31:22.446]  Well, Obama's already fudging.

[02:31:24.908 --> 02:31:35.796]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.084 --> 02:31:39.745]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.745 --> 02:31:41.605]  It's about a one-world government.

[02:31:58.351 --> 02:31:59.532]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.776 --> 02:32:07.297]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:32:07.297 --> 02:32:08.077]  and the world.
[02:32:08.077 --> 02:32:11.938]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:41.112]  Stand tall, baby!
[02:33:41.112 --> 02:33:42.452]  We are back live!
[02:34:05.493 --> 02:34:06.914]  Think of the insanity of it.
[02:34:06.914 --> 02:34:11.555]  The Associated Press admits they're spraying the atmosphere to save us from global warming.
[02:34:11.555 --> 02:34:15.456]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I'll sell you.
[02:34:15.456 --> 02:34:18.636]  We've got a report and I forgot to talk to him.
[02:34:18.636 --> 02:34:20.197]  We have Mr. King
[02:34:22.529 --> 02:34:26.954]  Gary King on the line who does a radio show.
[02:34:26.954 --> 02:34:28.957]  Too much is going on during these breaks.
[02:34:28.957 --> 02:34:30.739]  Does a radio show in New Orleans.
[02:34:30.739 --> 02:34:32.240]  Great job.
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:39.709]  They were searching around and found a job placement order for pilots to fly these planes during the chemtrail spring.
[02:34:41.004 --> 02:34:43.946]  But we're trying to vet that job placement place.
[02:34:43.946 --> 02:34:45.307]  Gary, I know you're listening.
[02:34:45.307 --> 02:34:49.190]  Email that right now to robd at InfoWars.com, the link.
[02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:51.611]  I'll go check it during the break, as you mentioned where it came from.
[02:34:51.611 --> 02:34:55.054]  I know they're linking to something else, but that's a little bit of a questionable operation.
[02:34:55.054 --> 02:34:58.636]  Probably an operative group, from what I've seen in the past.
[02:34:58.636 --> 02:35:00.357]  It's an infighting specialty group.
[02:35:00.357 --> 02:35:01.278]  So I want to...
[02:35:03.354 --> 02:35:04.835]  Go to the job placement myself.
[02:35:04.835 --> 02:35:11.198]  Because I mean we have all this mainstream stuff where they're announcing their chemtrailing is for our health and safety.
[02:35:11.198 --> 02:35:14.279]  And so I want to watch them doing poison the well op.
[02:35:14.279 --> 02:35:16.040]  So send that right now.
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:17.061]  I'll go look at it during the break.
[02:35:17.061 --> 02:35:20.522]  If I go put it off during the break while our other guest is talking, I can be scanning over it.
[02:35:20.522 --> 02:35:23.884]  That'll actually let him say a word or two before I cut him off.
[02:35:23.884 --> 02:35:25.825]  This is very, very historical.
[02:35:26.405 --> 02:35:27.145]  Going on there.
[02:35:27.145 --> 02:35:28.686]  So tell folks the date, the time.
[02:35:28.686 --> 02:35:32.887]  I may come, or I will at least dispatch Jason Burmiss.
[02:35:32.887 --> 02:35:35.587]  It's his turn to be fired out as the InfoWar probe droid.
[02:35:35.587 --> 02:35:38.008]  I've been sending the whole crew out for shoots lately.
[02:35:38.008 --> 02:35:39.528]  If I can stay here, I used to.
[02:35:39.528 --> 02:35:42.189]  I'd have to spread myself thin here.
[02:35:42.189 --> 02:35:43.089]  Tell us about the event.
[02:35:43.089 --> 02:35:43.889]  Tell us what's coming up.
[02:35:43.889 --> 02:35:50.211]  Tell us about, again, the ten principles here on air with us with the Oath Keepers.
[02:35:50.211 --> 02:35:53.471]  Oh, and by the way, did you get a big response last time you were on?
[02:35:53.471 --> 02:35:54.132]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:35:54.132 --> 02:35:55.072]  Yeah, you bet we did.
[02:35:55.072 --> 02:35:55.712]  Thank you very much.
[02:35:56.104 --> 02:35:57.685]  Did you hear from a lot more military and police?
[02:35:57.685 --> 02:35:59.986]  I know you've already heard from thousands.
[02:35:59.986 --> 02:36:05.610]  We've got a flood of active duty military that are signing up and that are coming to Lexington.
[02:36:05.610 --> 02:36:06.831]  We're getting new.
[02:36:06.831 --> 02:36:09.072]  We've got Marines coming from Camp Pendleton.
[02:36:09.072 --> 02:36:15.196]  We've got officers, 06 and above, coming from the Navy and from all the services.
[02:36:15.196 --> 02:36:16.557]  So it's been pretty amazing.
[02:36:16.557 --> 02:36:17.778]  So what we're going to do is, April 19th,
[02:36:18.918 --> 02:36:39.771]  On Lexington Green in Lexington, Massachusetts, right there where the first shots were fired in the American Revolution, on the anniversary, we're going to rally, we're going to muster, and it's an event put on by committees of safety, which is kind of a Walter Reddy and Edwin Vieira, and Mr. Vieira is going to speak, and Mr. Reddy is going to speak about their mission.
[02:36:40.251 --> 02:36:40.711]  We're good to go.
[02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:10.143]  Absolutely, and again, Evan Vieira, constitutional lawyer, constitutional law scholar, routine guest here with us, an amazing individual.
[02:37:10.143 --> 02:37:13.725]  The other gentleman, I'm aware of his work, great work as well.
[02:37:27.813 --> 02:37:32.637]  And I know the listeners have been trying to, you know, really energize their committees of safety.
[02:37:32.637 --> 02:37:50.511]  That's what began, as you know, but for listeners who may not, in the decade before 1775 and the Sons of Liberty, as the tyranny got worse and worse, they began to organize and petition and put out the information and say, look, you're committing crimes, you're abusing us, you better stop, better stop, better stop.
[02:37:50.511 --> 02:37:53.114]  And the Crown said, how dare you resist us?
[02:37:53.114 --> 02:37:54.435]  How dare you criticize us?
[02:37:55.116 --> 02:37:56.921]  Uh, you know, how dare you call for resisting us?
[02:37:56.921 --> 02:37:57.723]  That's treason.
[02:37:57.723 --> 02:37:59.268]  Same stuff we're hearing now.
[02:37:59.268 --> 02:38:01.815]  And I want to, you know, call out, uh, Dr. uh...
[02:38:02.904 --> 02:38:05.965]  Edwin Vieira and others is just great founding patriots.
[02:38:05.965 --> 02:38:15.129]  When Clinton was trying gun confiscations and announcing on MTV they were going to ban the guns and all of this, Edwin Vieira and others stood up and said, we need to remember the militia.
[02:38:15.129 --> 02:38:28.755]  Every able-bodied man, the Second Amendment is enshrined that all men, like in Switzerland and other countries, are there to defend, and it's our sacred right and our duty to own firearms, and they called forth the real citizens' militia to defend against tyranny.
[02:38:28.755 --> 02:38:32.317]  That's why the feds then created the false militia, infiltrated it,
[02:38:32.737 --> 02:38:37.400]  With people saying, hey, let's hide behind the shed, let's dress in camo, let's build pipe bombs.
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:38.901]  It was always federally led.
[02:38:38.901 --> 02:38:41.983]  Creating a fake Viper militia out of a motorcycle team.
[02:38:41.983 --> 02:38:46.106]  They created the fake militia so the media could then demonize it and attack it.
[02:38:46.106 --> 02:38:49.528]  And the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center got caught running these groups.
[02:38:49.528 --> 02:38:51.930]  Mainstream News has reported on that.
[02:38:51.930 --> 02:38:52.630]  Elohim City.
[02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:54.651]  So, you know, that's the groups we're talking about.
[02:38:54.651 --> 02:38:57.153]  The real militia versus the counterfeit militia.
[02:38:57.153 --> 02:38:58.854]  Like, we're the real patriot movement.
[02:38:58.854 --> 02:39:01.296]  Then you've got Glenn Beck, who's definitely an operative.
[02:39:02.717 --> 02:39:08.361]  Who tries to get your confidence and then stabs you in the back, as we predicted.
[02:39:08.361 --> 02:39:15.186]  So I just want to point out that this is people in the military, in the police, saying we'll just keep our oath.
[02:39:15.186 --> 02:39:20.130]  This is the key to not having a confrontation between the military and police and the people.
[02:39:20.130 --> 02:39:23.433]  Because if they're told to carry out unconstitutional orders, they won't.
[02:39:23.433 --> 02:39:30.038]  And then that won't bring in the ensuing hysteria and warfare that the establishment wants.
[02:39:31.325 --> 02:39:32.346]  That's right.
[02:39:32.346 --> 02:39:36.191]  And one thing I want to also mention is that Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be there.
[02:39:36.191 --> 02:39:43.220]  I invited him to come speak, and we've tried to get a message to Jack McLam, but definitely Sheriff Mack is going to be there.
[02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:47.045]  He has a new book out on the power of the sheriff and the responsibility of the sheriff.
[02:39:48.406 --> 02:39:50.527]  To be a barrier between the federal government and the people.
[02:39:50.527 --> 02:39:52.168]  How many people have contacted you overall on the site?
[02:39:52.168 --> 02:39:53.889]  I know it's getting a lot of traffic.
[02:39:53.889 --> 02:39:56.270]  Oh, several hundred thousand hits and just floods and floods of emails.
[02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:56.790]  Thousands of emails.
[02:40:12.243 --> 02:40:15.827]  We've got quite a response from people in Lexington.
[02:40:15.827 --> 02:40:20.572]  It's pretty short notice, we know, but it's pretty amazing how fast the response has been.
[02:40:20.572 --> 02:40:25.778]  Also, I've been invited to speak at a Tea Party Rally in Knoxville, Tennessee on the 15th.
[02:40:25.778 --> 02:40:28.741]  I might fly out there and do it impromptu.
[02:40:30.891 --> 02:40:32.612]  You know, get speech for them.
[02:40:32.612 --> 02:40:49.497]  And so what they want to do, they want to make it so that every protest from now on has an oath ceremony that men who have taken the oath in the past, veterans, or current serving military or law enforcement can step up and reaffirm their oath, and those who never have taken an oath to defend the Constitution can do so.
[02:40:49.497 --> 02:40:55.099]  And that would be pretty amazing to have thousands of people standing there with their hands raised and vowing to defend the Constitution.
[02:40:55.099 --> 02:40:56.460]  I think it's a really, really great idea.
[02:40:58.172 --> 02:41:01.915]  Absolutely, this is completely beautiful what's happening.
[02:41:01.915 --> 02:41:24.831]  Instead of the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, saying patriots and constitutionalists want to kill you, they're dangerous, the founding fathers are bad, we've got to confiscate the guns, we're saying no, stand with the people, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, because if you let the bankers, who are openly taking the country over, use you against the people, like the IMF and World Bank do in third world countries, this is a public plan,
[02:41:25.331 --> 02:41:27.514]  This is going to get really nasty.
[02:41:27.514 --> 02:41:32.161]  We're trying to short-circuit the corporate-controlled system trying to cause riots.
[02:41:32.161 --> 02:41:39.330]  I'm sure you've noticed that they're all over the media trying to hype rioting and civil insurrection so they can then blame it on us.
[02:41:39.330 --> 02:41:42.775]  This is essential to stop this clash from happening.
[02:41:43.581 --> 02:41:45.023]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:41:45.023 --> 02:41:54.675]  If the military and the police realize their true duty to the people and to their oath to the Constitution, then it just can't happen.
[02:41:54.675 --> 02:41:55.356]  It's game over.
[02:41:55.356 --> 02:41:57.059]  It's checkmate for them.
[02:41:57.059 --> 02:41:59.802]  They cannot do it without the military and the police.
[02:41:59.802 --> 02:42:00.443]  That's our mission.
[02:42:00.663 --> 02:42:03.005]  The globalists have to have enforcers.
[02:42:03.005 --> 02:42:04.606]  There's only a few thousand of them.
[02:42:04.606 --> 02:42:09.069]  And that's why they love the tragic murder of those three police officers by a white supremacist.
[02:42:09.069 --> 02:42:15.133]  And it turns out the white supremacist was attacking me on websites, but the Southern Poverty Law Center didn't care.
[02:42:15.133 --> 02:42:22.858]  They went and found those comments and tried to claim, you know, tie it to the Patriot movement, Ron Paul, myself, and everybody else, and now they've had to retract.
[02:42:23.198 --> 02:42:31.742]  But, again, that shows they're scared of us, that they're resorting to tactics like that, because they don't want the police and military joining us.
[02:42:31.742 --> 02:42:32.182]  That's right.
[02:42:32.182 --> 02:42:33.742]  That was Billy Coase, right?
[02:42:33.742 --> 02:42:36.103]  That first disaster campaign, is that right?
[02:42:36.103 --> 02:42:40.205]  Yeah, they've had to now retract, so has Raw Story, so has the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[02:42:40.205 --> 02:42:47.848]  But the New York Times is refusing, and now Alternet and also George Soros' website is attacking us.
[02:42:47.848 --> 02:42:48.809]  That's media matters.
[02:42:49.741 --> 02:43:01.066]  You know, one of the Daily Coast writers in another comment thread on their site was talking about if these gun owners, if they think they're going to be able to defeat the U.S.
[02:43:01.066 --> 02:43:03.047]  government, we've got news for them.
[02:43:03.047 --> 02:43:12.051]  We're going to, as you just talked about and bragged about, being able to call in airstrikes and use artillery fire and flatten their homes and kill their wives and children.
[02:43:12.051 --> 02:43:13.832]  They're one of the regular writers.
[02:43:13.832 --> 02:43:17.034]  And so that's what, you know, it's reaffirmed for me that we're on the right track.
[02:43:17.034 --> 02:43:17.734]  Our mission is, it's
[02:43:18.594 --> 02:43:20.875]  Who is this enemy of the republic?
[02:43:20.875 --> 02:43:21.855]  I want to do a story on him.
[02:43:21.855 --> 02:43:24.196]  I'll look his name up.
[02:43:24.196 --> 02:43:25.437]  I'll email it to him.
[02:43:25.437 --> 02:43:26.097]  No, no, no.
[02:43:26.097 --> 02:43:27.978]  Yeah, look it up during the break.
[02:43:27.978 --> 02:43:29.458]  Because I want to go after these people.
[02:43:29.458 --> 02:43:31.159]  I mean, they love power.
[02:43:31.159 --> 02:43:34.120]  They're now bragging that they funded Pol Pot.
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:36.701]  Brzezinski is again a headline.
[02:43:36.701 --> 02:43:38.162]  Google, I want to show that.
[02:43:38.162 --> 02:43:39.502]  German government says U.S.
[02:43:39.502 --> 02:43:41.023]  government funded Pol Pot.
[02:43:41.383 --> 02:43:41.964]  Nope, it's not.
[02:44:04.022 --> 02:44:04.843]  That's exactly right.
[02:44:04.843 --> 02:44:06.044]  It just pisses us off.
[02:44:06.044 --> 02:44:12.569]  The more we talk like that, the more anger we get, and the more resolved we are to make sure that they have nothing.
[02:44:12.569 --> 02:44:14.350]  They have no power over us.
[02:44:14.350 --> 02:44:29.361]  And so that's our job, is to not buy into their propaganda and their assumption that they've got... So you've got this phony leftist, quote, pacifist, bragging about all the power they've got now through the military and how they'll bomb our homes, sick.
[02:44:30.441 --> 02:44:36.084]  Well, now they support the Iraq War, now they support the carnage, because they're good liberals.
[02:44:36.084 --> 02:44:50.150]  Yeah, this same writer during the Bush administration was talking about how terrible it is to have civilian casualties, but now he turns around and says, ah, we're going to shell you, and we're going to call in airstrikes on you.
[02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:52.708]  Yeah, I'm looking up for the link right now.
[02:45:21.107 --> 02:45:23.208]  In fact, where's that headline?
[02:45:23.208 --> 02:45:25.208]  Here it is.
[02:45:25.208 --> 02:45:30.649]  This is at a press conference, so it's, you Google, George Soros having a great crisis, you'll get hundreds of articles.
[02:45:30.649 --> 02:45:33.510]  Zoom in on this guy, show him.
[02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:39.392]  I'm having a very good crisis, Soros says, heads fund manager, makes billions off recession.
[02:45:39.392 --> 02:45:42.852]  He says it's very stimulating and the culmination of his life's work.
[02:45:42.852 --> 02:45:44.573]  It's his life's work to do this.
[02:45:45.475 --> 02:45:49.637]  Many brags on TV how they cut the oil prices to bankrupt the economy worse.
[02:45:49.637 --> 02:45:52.338]  This guy is sick, is he not?
[02:45:52.338 --> 02:45:52.879]  Absolutely.
[02:45:52.879 --> 02:45:55.280]  I found his name, his name is Marcion.
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:00.082]  It goes by the name Marcion on the LA coast and he writes all kinds of articles for them.
[02:46:00.082 --> 02:46:05.105]  And what's the name of the article where he says he wants to use the military to shell women and children?
[02:46:05.105 --> 02:46:11.068]  It's an article about, it was an article, let me see, it's called a letter from a militia man with pole.
[02:46:11.747 --> 02:46:15.676]  Which was posted by JC Wilmore and what he had done is...
[02:46:17.806 --> 02:46:34.499]  A gentleman named Michael Vandenberg, who was involved in the Bush movement back in the 80s, had written him a response to something he had posted about claiming that the GOP was responsible for militias and was fighting violence and things like that.
[02:46:34.499 --> 02:46:41.605]  And so he wrote him a letter saying, look, the GOP, as far as we're concerned, is morally bankrupt and is an empty shell.
[02:46:42.205 --> 02:46:47.370]  Your real problem is with the people of the United States, as Vanderbilt wrote.
[02:46:47.370 --> 02:46:53.335]  And so this guy posted his letter on Daily Kos saying, look at this wacko militia guy that wrote me.
[02:46:53.335 --> 02:46:57.919]  And then started talking about how we're going to stop these people, what we're going to do to the gun owners.
[02:46:57.919 --> 02:47:00.241]  That's the discussion thread of this guy.
[02:47:05.143 --> 02:47:17.054]  We've confirmed that one of the big shows on Air America, on in major cities, is saying I'm calling for violence and that I told the shooter to kill the cops when it turns out the white supremacist was attacking me.
[02:47:17.054 --> 02:47:19.316]  Now that's incredible libel, slander, defamation.
[02:47:21.486 --> 02:47:23.587]  Now, that's going on.
[02:47:23.587 --> 02:47:31.290]  We're here explaining the globalists have to have a breakdown of society and civil war to get away with the theft, because they need the U.S.
[02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:34.671]  to fall now that they've stolen the GDP in six months.
[02:47:34.671 --> 02:47:35.311]  It's already done.
[02:47:35.311 --> 02:47:35.911]  You can't fix it.
[02:47:35.911 --> 02:47:37.092]  It's so bad, folks.
[02:47:37.092 --> 02:47:38.252]  We're going to go into a depression.
[02:47:38.252 --> 02:47:39.152]  It's going to be horrible.
[02:47:39.152 --> 02:47:41.353]  But they intend to keep piling on the tyranny.
[02:47:41.353 --> 02:47:42.853]  They want to have a war.
[02:47:42.853 --> 02:47:44.054]  They want to have a conflict.
[02:47:45.106 --> 02:47:54.368]  And then they've got the nerve to say that we're behind this and we're doing this, and then they're bragging about how they want to use military against the American people.
[02:47:54.368 --> 02:47:59.249]  My God, I mean, do they have any idea how hellish this is going to be if this starts up?
[02:47:59.249 --> 02:47:59.969]  Here's what he says.
[02:47:59.969 --> 02:48:10.192]  He says, if these gun nuts think they can take the field against one of the most brutal war machines in the world, they would be disabused of that notion after the first airstrikes start coming in.
[02:48:10.192 --> 02:48:11.472]  That's what he says.
[02:48:13.291 --> 02:48:25.015]  So, and he continues on, talking about how, you know, uh, do you think any American would be willing to charge a military convoy under helicopter fire or calmly watch as their house is leveled with their wife and children inside?
[02:48:25.015 --> 02:48:27.736]  That's the reality of asymmetrical warfare against the U.S.
[02:48:27.736 --> 02:48:27.996]  Army.
[02:48:27.996 --> 02:48:34.758]  It'll rain down high explosives on you from distant distance while you're trying to land a lucky shot between interlocking armor plate.
[02:48:34.758 --> 02:48:39.520]  You think these bitches would really be willing to strap explosives on themselves around a police station?
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:41.521]  Not just once, but as a regular tactic?
[02:48:41.521 --> 02:48:42.141]  I don't think so.
[02:48:42.281 --> 02:48:44.982]  Now he's calling the American people bitches.
[02:48:44.982 --> 02:48:46.343]  See, they have a total disdain.
[02:48:46.343 --> 02:48:50.204]  When you listen to NPR, it's like, in fact, I have the cover of Time Magazine.
[02:48:50.204 --> 02:48:51.365]  Bring it to me.
[02:48:51.365 --> 02:48:53.226]  It was in here in the stack and somebody took it away.
[02:48:53.226 --> 02:48:54.566]  It was Newsweek.
[02:48:54.566 --> 02:48:55.827]  Oh, here it is.
[02:48:55.827 --> 02:49:02.129]  The End of Excess, Why the Crisis is Good for America by Kurt Anderson.
[02:49:02.129 --> 02:49:04.690]  Time Magazine.
[02:49:04.690 --> 02:49:10.513]  And they're saying, oh, this will teach us to live in our means while the control freak parasites sit on top of us.
[02:49:12.284 --> 02:49:13.985]  God, they have no idea what they're bringing in.
[02:49:13.985 --> 02:49:21.527]  They have no idea what they've done and uh... Oh my God.
[02:49:21.527 --> 02:49:23.848]  They don't understand, folks.
[02:49:23.848 --> 02:49:27.869]  They don't understand the differences between the United States and Iraq.
[02:49:27.869 --> 02:49:31.490]  That's why the Pentagon said they can't invade Iran because they couldn't win there.
[02:49:31.490 --> 02:49:38.552]  Iraq was an intelligence hive of the United States since the seventies and so they knew how to control it.
[02:49:38.552 --> 02:49:39.432]  And it was still hellish.
[02:49:42.034 --> 02:49:46.598]  But listen how they show who they are, bad-mouthing the American people.
[02:49:46.598 --> 02:49:48.020]  Oh, I tell you, this is sick.
[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:49.261]  This is sick.
[02:49:49.261 --> 02:49:57.649]  That's the same guy who, in another article, was lamenting any civilian casualties in Iraq, which is a worthy thing to say.
[02:49:57.649 --> 02:50:05.596]  But then when it comes to his political enemies, those he disdains, those that he considers to be the other, those he considers to be subhuman, which is us,
[02:50:06.249 --> 02:50:10.672]  You know, that he has no remorse whatsoever about bragging about how he's going to fly.
[02:50:10.672 --> 02:50:15.935]  Yeah, we're the sub-human Americans that are pro-gun and pro-freedom that built the country.
[02:50:15.935 --> 02:50:21.599]  We're the sub-humans that pay his George Soros paycheck that they've sucked out of our economy.
[02:50:21.599 --> 02:50:27.823]  Well, you know, Communists always believe in purging and killing massive amounts of those they consider to be social entities.
[02:50:27.823 --> 02:50:31.526]  Hey, I have the Zeitgeist guy on the show said I would be sent to re-education!
[02:50:33.547 --> 02:50:38.089]  And then I said, well that's wrong, and he said, you can't fathom our mind.
[02:50:38.089 --> 02:50:41.811]  They always say this, like some wooden apparatchik in the Soviet Union.
[02:50:41.811 --> 02:50:46.334]  We know best, and so it's okay to send you to a re-education camp.
[02:50:46.334 --> 02:50:51.857]  And I said, well that's, and I said, well that's tyranny, and he said, no, you don't fathom our mind.
[02:50:51.857 --> 02:50:54.418]  You, you don't understand.
[02:50:54.418 --> 02:51:00.141]  And then I guess if I can't be re-educated, gotta break a few eggs, stay there.
[02:51:01.601 --> 02:51:03.902]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[02:51:03.902 --> 02:51:06.044]  It's time to think outside the box.
[02:51:06.044 --> 02:51:08.025]  How about starting your own garden?
[02:51:08.025 --> 02:51:10.266]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.
[02:51:10.266 --> 02:51:13.168]  To get the most out of your investment, you need the fertilizer.

[02:52:01.989 --> 02:52:07.817]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.817 --> 02:52:14.846]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.385 --> 02:52:21.972]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.972 --> 02:52:23.954]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.954 --> 02:52:26.457]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.457 --> 02:52:37.368]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:52:38.032 --> 02:52:39.694]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.694 --> 02:52:41.556]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.556 --> 02:52:48.462]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.730 --> 02:52:58.312]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.312 --> 02:52:59.493]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.576 --> 02:53:02.477]  Attention, gardeners!
[02:53:02.477 --> 02:53:05.078]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[02:53:05.078 --> 02:53:09.621]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:53:09.621 --> 02:53:17.826]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:53:17.826 --> 02:53:20.628]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:53:20.916 --> 02:53:28.564]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:53:28.564 --> 02:53:34.390]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:53:34.390 --> 02:53:40.216]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:53:40.216 --> 02:53:43.480]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:47.345]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:53:47.345 --> 02:53:52.431]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:53:52.431 --> 02:53:55.315]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:53:55.315 --> 02:53:55.515]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:54:08.829 --> 02:54:10.831]  I'm making the new Obama film.
[02:54:10.831 --> 02:54:11.931]  I mean, new.
[02:54:11.931 --> 02:54:13.152]  The Obama Deception is brand new.
[02:54:13.152 --> 02:54:14.093]  It's number one out there.
[02:54:14.093 --> 02:54:20.758]  It'll be out on July 4th, and it's gonna have the great folks, the Oat Keepers in it.
[02:54:20.758 --> 02:54:26.102]  So I was already thinking about going and interviewing Edwin Vieira, the doctor, and a few others for it, and I just thought, oh, I'm too busy.
[02:54:26.102 --> 02:54:27.483]  We've got enough interviews.
[02:54:27.483 --> 02:54:33.407]  But I knew there was something else that needed to be added, and I was gonna, we're sending folks to some tea parties, but no, no, this is key.
[02:54:33.407 --> 02:54:34.028]  This is key.
[02:54:35.546 --> 02:54:38.689]  And so I'm very, very excited about that.
[02:54:38.689 --> 02:54:41.372]  And hey guys, I want you guys to decide who's going to go.
[02:54:41.372 --> 02:54:43.654]  We need to go ahead and get plane tickets.
[02:54:43.654 --> 02:54:47.617]  It's on April 19th on that Sunday, but I want you to talk to Edwin Vieira.
[02:54:47.617 --> 02:54:53.002]  I want you to go ahead and talk to them and set up times to interview them at their hotel the night before or the day after.
[02:54:53.743 --> 02:55:03.230]  And we'll also interview the amazing Stuart Rhodes for the film, because I'm trying to make the films about other people other than myself, but then it's always me out doing the activism.
[02:55:03.230 --> 02:55:08.455]  I'm going to attempt to probably, just because I'm, frankly, the films sell better if I'm in them.
[02:55:08.455 --> 02:55:11.877]  Everybody's told me that, but this one probably won't have Alex Jones or a voiceover.
[02:55:11.877 --> 02:55:19.043]  Well, it's going to have a little bit of me doing a voiceover or having little pop-ins on video, but not a lot of Alex is the point.
[02:55:20.307 --> 02:55:21.728]  And so, we're on.
[02:55:21.728 --> 02:55:22.148]  We're on.
[02:55:22.148 --> 02:55:23.389]  We're going to send somebody.
[02:55:23.389 --> 02:55:26.992]  I'm going to have at least two of my guys up there, and we'll get all that done.
[02:55:26.992 --> 02:55:31.556]  We're going to call Dr. Vieira and get all that lined up as well.
[02:55:31.556 --> 02:55:36.499]  But look, Stuart Rhodes, I'll have you back up in the next few weeks as this builds.
[02:55:36.499 --> 02:55:37.680]  Give people the details again.
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:46.307]  Fire off the website of police and military coming and pledging en masse publicly, or they can do it incognito with a pseudonym, saying, I'm going to uphold the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:55:47.577 --> 02:55:51.158]  That's oath-keepers.blogspot.com.
[02:55:51.158 --> 02:55:52.579]  And we've got a brand new video out.
[02:55:52.579 --> 02:55:55.240]  We put our 10 orders will not obey on video.
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:57.121]  It's on YouTube right now.
[02:55:57.121 --> 02:55:58.741]  Please send it around.
[02:55:58.741 --> 02:56:00.622]  And also we could use our user support.
[02:56:00.622 --> 02:56:05.724]  We run pretty lean and we're kind of outpacing our own supply line, kind of like Patton did.
[02:56:05.724 --> 02:56:09.285]  But we could definitely use some support to help further our efforts.
[02:56:09.585 --> 02:56:18.232]  Well, I'm going to have my crew there, and so set aside a time for us to interview you for about an hour or so in your hotel room, or in a conference room where there's not a lot of noise, and we need to interview Dr. Edwin Vieira and everybody else.
[02:56:32.290 --> 02:56:40.958]  And Dan Ipsen's going to be there, and Joe Bonick, legislators who sponsored some of the sovereignty initiatives are going to be there as well.
[02:56:40.958 --> 02:56:44.121]  Okay, do me a favor, will you send me, will you send me all, you want to go?
[02:56:44.121 --> 02:56:46.483]  Okay, we're going to send Rob Due and Bernice.
[02:56:46.483 --> 02:56:53.670]  Will you do me a favor, will you, I'm sending Aaron to Kansas City this weekend for an interview.
[02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:55.412]  This film's going to have a lot of cool interviews in it.
[02:56:59.434 --> 02:57:04.396]  Yeah, do me a favor, will you email Rob Due all those guys' contacts so that we can have the interviews lined up before we get there?
[02:57:04.396 --> 02:57:11.680]  Because it won't happen if we show up while they're busy shaking hands for two hours and try to get the interviews and then it's all pointless.
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:18.003]  Well, very, very exciting and people should go up to the site and read the 10 things you will not do because those are all the things that are being asked to be done.
[02:57:18.003 --> 02:57:21.505]  Can you believe all these liberal sites and I was just given more mainstream newspapers attacking me.
[02:57:22.125 --> 02:57:24.146]  Well, that's part of the strategy.
[02:57:45.911 --> 02:57:47.772]  It's like this Marcian guy.
[02:57:47.772 --> 02:57:49.012]  I want to read this to you real quick.
[02:57:49.012 --> 02:57:52.474]  He says, I don't think American soldiers would hesitate to kill Americans.
[02:57:52.474 --> 02:57:53.954]  They are a very professional force.
[02:57:53.954 --> 02:58:02.518]  And then he says, after the demonization job that would be done by the media, Americans would be positively demanding airstrikes on their own cities.
[02:58:02.518 --> 02:58:03.118]  That's what he says.
[02:58:03.658 --> 02:58:14.523]  Yeah, communists are always, and socialists are always, real cold-blooded and into the Machiavellian mind, and they just love getting in a power position and imagining what they do.
[02:58:14.523 --> 02:58:19.685]  Oh, we would demonize the gun owners, and then we'd airstrike them, and oh God, I can't wait!
[02:58:19.685 --> 02:58:21.746]  We're so close to getting these gun owners!
[02:58:21.746 --> 02:58:23.927]  We're so close to bombing their families!
[02:58:23.927 --> 02:58:26.929]  Oh God, I've got Foundation money and Soros money!
[02:58:26.929 --> 02:58:28.309]  We're butchering America!
[02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:29.570]  The global tax is here!
[02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:34.536]  We've stalled the people long enough, and we're so close to turn the military and police against the people.
[02:58:34.536 --> 02:58:35.877]  It's gonna be so good!
[02:58:35.877 --> 02:58:38.480]  Oh, we can't wait to destroy America!
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:39.381]  Yes!
[02:58:39.381 --> 02:58:40.263]  Yes!
[02:58:40.263 --> 02:58:41.063]  Oh, so good!
[02:58:41.063 --> 02:58:46.490]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.490 --> 02:58:48.532]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.343 --> 02:58:53.025]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.025 --> 02:58:57.771]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.771 --> 02:59:00.735]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.735 --> 02:59:03.779]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.779 --> 02:59:09.627]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.847 --> 02:59:13.090]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.090 --> 02:59:20.095]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.095 --> 02:59:23.358]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.358 --> 02:59:25.039]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:28.502 --> 02:59:34.768]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.768 --> 02:59:38.552]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.552 --> 02:59:40.074]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:40.074 --> 02:59:40.514]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.514 --> 02:59:42.336]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.184 --> 02:59:56.586]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.586 --> 03:00:02.711]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.711 --> 03:00:06.054]  We have to believe we can fight the New World Order.
[03:00:06.054 --> 03:00:08.476]  We have to believe we can have victory.
[03:00:18.353 --> 03:00:26.160]  Well, you're going to see the COINTELPRO operatives and their unwitting dupes who are just conned.
[03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:40.572]  You've seen this from Rolling Stone and other books and magazine articles that I've seen over the years where they're claiming, oh my God, the Republican Party has right-wing militias that want to overthrow the government and kill everybody.
[03:00:40.572 --> 03:00:42.694]  That's George Soros propaganda.
[03:00:43.988 --> 03:00:55.014]  And so he was just mentioning, that's what made me think of it, our guest, Stuart Rhodes, worked with the Ron Paul campaign at the highest levels, now spinning off doing this, saying to the police and military, hey, join the Republic, join the Bill of Rights.
[03:00:55.014 --> 03:00:56.475]  We're the good guys.
[03:00:56.475 --> 03:00:58.136]  We're not the Republican Party.
[03:00:58.136 --> 03:00:59.897]  We're not the Democratic Party.
[03:00:59.897 --> 03:01:03.239]  You know, they claimed I worked for the Democrats secretly when I was attacking Bush.
[03:01:03.239 --> 03:01:03.940]  Vice versa.
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:16.084]  We are trying to get the military and police to defend the Bill of Rights Constitution, not fire on Americans, not get in shootouts with law-abiding citizens, not have gun confiscations, not have secret arrest of citizens.
[03:01:16.084 --> 03:01:19.865]  All the things that are now admitted, that are going on, they're trying.
[03:01:19.865 --> 03:01:23.746]  Who could say that isn't a wholesome, good thing, and to have them upkeep their oath?
[03:01:24.406 --> 03:01:30.569]  Well, George Soros and their crowd are hopping mad because, believe me, we are the resistance.
[03:01:30.569 --> 03:01:32.370]  You want to know who's resisting this new world order?
[03:01:32.370 --> 03:01:36.952]  You want to know who's at the tip of the spear and who's affecting change and who they're worried about?
[03:01:38.595 --> 03:01:40.577]  That's why we have Republicans and Democrats.
[03:01:40.577 --> 03:01:46.423]  You have Glenn Beck saying the FEMA camps aren't real, we're all cooks, you know, restaurant Paul supporters, but then he's still our best friend.
[03:01:46.423 --> 03:01:58.756]  You've got all the big liberal sites doing it, and their own members are posting, the majority of comments, are countering them, going, no, no, Alex Jones is good, you know, he calls for nonviolence, as they go, Jones says kill cops!
[03:01:58.756 --> 03:02:01.298]  This isn't going to work, and anybody you hear
[03:02:02.159 --> 03:02:06.722]  Putting that out as an operative, folks, you want to know instantly who an operative is.
[03:02:06.722 --> 03:02:07.503]  That's how you know.
[03:02:07.503 --> 03:02:11.346]  Going back briefly to Stuart Rhodes, I appreciate doing what he's done.
[03:02:11.346 --> 03:02:16.449]  Look, he's taken up the mantle, taken up the leadership, energizing and having a huge effect.
[03:02:16.449 --> 03:02:18.691]  Tens of thousands of police and military on record.
[03:02:19.031 --> 03:02:22.514]  Saying we, and sending in their photos, or sending in the picture of their ring.
[03:02:22.514 --> 03:02:23.856]  They can be public or not public.
[03:02:23.856 --> 03:02:25.357]  A lot of them want to be public.
[03:02:25.357 --> 03:02:26.558]  Saying we're not going along.
[03:02:26.558 --> 03:02:27.879]  And then we're the mainstream.
[03:02:27.879 --> 03:02:29.000]  We're the majority.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:30.542]  We're the constitutionalists.
[03:02:30.542 --> 03:02:32.283]  That's why the feds bombed Oklahoma City.
[03:02:33.154 --> 03:02:36.376]  Was to put a chilling effect on the Patriot Movement and claim we did it.
[03:02:36.376 --> 03:02:38.277]  Well, we're not even calling this a Patriot Movement.
[03:02:38.277 --> 03:02:41.640]  This is a constitutional movement against tyranny.
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:47.944]  And you notice the operatives are going to say we're violent and seize on any opportunity to frame us and cast us that way.
[03:02:47.944 --> 03:02:49.104]  It isn't going to work.
[03:02:49.104 --> 03:02:56.069]  The police and military are now understanding they want to get a war started between the American people because a divided house cannot stand.
[03:02:56.069 --> 03:02:58.751]  We've got to come together for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:02:58.751 --> 03:03:01.813]  Do you stand with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson?
[03:03:03.536 --> 03:03:05.538]  And the Founding Fathers?
[03:03:05.538 --> 03:03:14.505]  Or do you stand with George Bush and George Soros and with Barack Obama and Zbigniew Brzezinski?
[03:03:14.505 --> 03:03:15.546]  They're demonizing us!
[03:03:15.546 --> 03:03:16.807]  What does that tell you?
[03:03:16.807 --> 03:03:22.392]  In closing, tell folks about the website, when the event is, April 18th and April 19th.
[03:03:22.392 --> 03:03:26.856]  We are Oath-Keepers, which is Oath-Keepers.blogspot.com
[03:03:29.717 --> 03:03:34.439]  And you can go there and read testimonials from active military, retired, and police.
[03:03:34.439 --> 03:03:37.501]  And we are rallying on the Green at Lexington on April 19th.
[03:03:37.501 --> 03:03:40.322]  We'll actually be there Saturday, the 18th.
[03:03:40.322 --> 03:03:55.249]  And on Sunday, the 19th of April, at Lexington, Massachusetts, to reaffirm our oaths, to read aloud to the whole world our declaration of orders we will not obey, and to put it on film, and let it go viral, and throw down the gauntlet.
[03:03:55.769 --> 03:03:57.531]  And make it clear to them that we're not going to play along.
[03:04:15.931 --> 03:04:17.392]  I may come there, I may do that.
[03:04:17.392 --> 03:04:21.456]  I just don't want to have my hotel robbed or anything, so I'd like to not announce what I'm doing.
[03:04:21.456 --> 03:04:25.920]  The point is, is that we are taking action, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:27.321]  I will have people there.
[03:04:27.321 --> 03:04:28.803]  Be there the 18th and 19th.
[03:04:28.803 --> 03:04:30.084]  Again, give folks the town, the place.
[03:04:31.104 --> 03:04:31.524]  This is beautiful.
[03:04:31.524 --> 03:04:32.124]  This is beautiful.
[03:04:32.124 --> 03:04:33.385]  This is real resistance to tyranny.
[03:04:33.385 --> 03:04:36.766]  A real counter-revolution to the globalist revolution to overthrow our republic.
[03:04:36.766 --> 03:04:37.506]  We are restorationists.
[03:04:37.506 --> 03:04:38.766]  Thank you so much, Mr. Rhodes.
[03:05:01.812 --> 03:05:03.294]  So you want to stop smoking.
[03:05:03.294 --> 03:05:04.575]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[03:05:04.575 --> 03:05:07.458]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[03:05:07.458 --> 03:05:11.443]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[03:05:11.443 --> 03:05:15.207]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[03:05:15.207 --> 03:05:17.229]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[03:05:17.229 --> 03:05:20.914]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[03:05:21.514 --> 03:05:28.578]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[03:05:28.578 --> 03:05:36.623]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smokefree capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[03:05:36.923 --> 03:05:38.284]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:06:05.123 --> 03:06:07.728]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.728 --> 03:06:14.780]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.316 --> 03:06:21.902]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.902 --> 03:06:23.884]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.884 --> 03:06:26.386]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.386 --> 03:06:37.957]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:37.957 --> 03:06:39.639]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.639 --> 03:06:41.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.477 --> 03:06:48.380]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.380 --> 03:06:56.643]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.643 --> 03:06:58.224]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.224 --> 03:07:01.445]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.445 --> 03:07:02.345]  You worry.
[03:07:02.345 --> 03:07:04.406]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[03:07:04.406 --> 03:07:07.067]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[03:07:07.067 --> 03:07:08.828]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[03:07:12.892 --> 03:07:13.452]  We're good to go!
[03:07:42.964 --> 03:07:45.085]  How to prepare, use, and store it.
[03:07:45.085 --> 03:07:49.106]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers.
[03:07:49.106 --> 03:07:53.127]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[03:07:53.127 --> 03:07:54.507]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[03:07:54.507 --> 03:07:56.228]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[03:08:03.203 --> 03:08:09.830]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:16.876]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.876 --> 03:08:18.918]  I could have this next guest on for 10 hours.
[03:08:18.918 --> 03:08:19.919]  What a political mind.
[03:08:19.919 --> 03:08:23.303]  I want to have him back up on the show on a routine basis.
[03:08:25.686 --> 03:08:29.429]  I apologize for moving him from Monday to today.
[03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:33.251]  I just had national media trying to frame me as a cop killer.
[03:08:33.251 --> 03:08:37.554]  Last week it was trying to frame me, alternative media, as a murderer of a talk show host.
[03:08:37.554 --> 03:08:40.556]  So the attacks are really getting bad.
[03:08:40.556 --> 03:08:48.141]  I mean it's getting crazy because even the national media is identifying me as the leader of the anti-government movement.
[03:08:48.141 --> 03:08:55.326]  Well, if anti-government means I'm against gun confiscation, 12.8 trillion stolen in six months by offshore banks,
[03:08:56.206 --> 03:09:00.950]  Uh, Tennessee newspapers reporting that the governor said no army checkpoints and they still did it?
[03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:03.372]  I mean, that's confirmed!
[03:09:03.372 --> 03:09:05.955]  Uh, Marines out running checkpoints around the country suddenly?
[03:09:05.955 --> 03:09:10.839]  I mean, we are entering the vortex!
[03:09:10.839 --> 03:09:21.467]  And, and then now the Associated Press, we got a big article going up on PrisonPlanet.com on this, the Associated Press comes out and admits that there's chemtrails spraying
[03:09:22.526 --> 03:09:29.589]  Going on by the government for our safety that they are spraying.
[03:09:29.589 --> 03:09:38.732]  Obama looks at climate engineering, I mean, and then we found all these government sites where they admit it's a giant worldwide program where they're manipulating.
[03:09:38.732 --> 03:09:41.213]  There's AP on your screen!
[03:09:41.213 --> 03:09:42.774]  And I've always known they were spraying.
[03:09:42.774 --> 03:09:44.955]  I mean, these trails didn't stay in the sky before 96.
[03:09:46.633 --> 03:09:55.956]  Then we got other government documents and talked to whistleblowers, but now they put out high school and college textbooks saying the government's spraying the sky to keep you safe from UV radiation.
[03:09:57.219 --> 03:10:09.608]  And then there's thousands of government studies where they admit they're doing it, and then we see all these, and then the AP admits it, and Obama gives an interview, and talks about, I mean, and I'm still going to be called a kook!
[03:10:09.608 --> 03:10:19.096]  I mean, they've announced every world, world government run by the bankers that you pay taxes to, that rules the entire earth with an 80% tax rate run by the OECD.
[03:10:20.788 --> 03:10:23.409]  I'd read Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, U.N.
[03:10:23.409 --> 03:10:29.931]  OECD documents ten years ago where they said we'll have an 80-plus percent tax rate, one-child policies, carbon taxes on everybody.
[03:10:29.931 --> 03:10:31.872]  And I went on air and said, here they are saying it.
[03:10:31.872 --> 03:10:36.573]  You know, here's CFR last year calling for world government, global governance, carbon taxes.
[03:10:36.573 --> 03:10:40.414]  Headline, International Institutions and Global Governance Program.
[03:10:40.414 --> 03:10:43.515]  CFR.org!
[03:10:43.515 --> 03:10:45.396]  No liberties, no freedoms, total control.
[03:10:46.892 --> 03:10:48.013]  And people are denying that!
[03:10:48.013 --> 03:10:49.935]  I mean, I'm being attacked right now.
[03:10:49.935 --> 03:11:02.565]  They just walked in and gave me two more newspapers attacking me, saying I'm dangerous and calling for violence when I'm calling to stop violence, and saying I'm making up all of this stuff when it's all over the news.
[03:11:02.565 --> 03:11:06.028]  Let me tell you, folks, I've got to chill up my spine, because I know what that means.
[03:11:06.028 --> 03:11:12.434]  The fact that they're bringing me out this big means they're planning to really try to do something to us, and I just pray for us, folks.
[03:11:12.434 --> 03:11:14.355]  Let's go to Michael Bagner, a constitutional scholar.
[03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:17.691]  To talk about all these things that are happening.
[03:11:17.691 --> 03:11:21.995]  Presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, 2004.
[03:11:21.995 --> 03:11:24.557]  Michael Bagneri, good to have you here with us.
[03:11:24.557 --> 03:11:28.141]  I'm so pleased to be here, Alex, and I want to congratulate you.
[03:11:28.141 --> 03:11:34.727]  The fact that they are making all of these attacks means that you have been doing a fantastic job.
[03:11:34.727 --> 03:11:38.610]  That you really are a threat to the New World Order.
[03:11:38.610 --> 03:11:39.191]  I'm envious.
[03:11:40.751 --> 03:11:43.633]  Well, don't envy him until you've been in the position, Michael.
[03:11:43.633 --> 03:11:58.662]  Well, you've been all over national television and got nationally attacked when you were the Libertarian Party candidate for president, getting so much attention, so you've actually been there before, but no, it starts getting a little bit spooky, man, when they're saying on Air America, I'm calling for killing cops, when I've never said that.
[03:11:58.662 --> 03:12:04.806]  I mean, I mean... Yeah, you've never said that, but again, they are getting nervous.
[03:12:04.806 --> 03:12:07.388]  We are finally having an effect to the point where
[03:12:07.984 --> 03:12:20.115]  They, in their ivory towers, are getting a little bit nervous because they know the natives are restless, and we are getting ready to take back our constitutional republic.
[03:12:20.115 --> 03:12:22.437]  Well, that's right.
[03:12:22.437 --> 03:12:23.638]  We're lawfully doing this.
[03:12:23.638 --> 03:12:27.382]  This is a criminal government, and what does the Declaration of Independence say about a criminal government?
[03:12:28.447 --> 03:12:31.508]  We can alter or abolish it.
[03:12:31.508 --> 03:12:32.568]  We've created it.
[03:12:32.568 --> 03:12:39.570]  We have individual rights and they have privileges that we grant them by way of Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.
[03:12:39.570 --> 03:12:40.691]  And now they've got it backwards.
[03:12:40.691 --> 03:12:45.732]  They tell us they grant us privileges and that they have rights.
[03:12:45.732 --> 03:12:47.493]  But that's ass-backwards, isn't it?
[03:12:48.439 --> 03:12:54.341]  It is passed backwards, and that is the focus of my Constitution class.
[03:12:54.341 --> 03:12:58.202]  My 8-hour class, Chapter 2, Rights vs. Privileges.
[03:12:58.202 --> 03:13:00.643]  We the people have individual rights.
[03:13:00.643 --> 03:13:03.284]  We give government privileges.
[03:13:03.284 --> 03:13:08.266]  And it's the very first words of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 1, Clause 1.
[03:13:09.208 --> 03:13:13.050]  All legislative powers herein granted.
[03:13:13.050 --> 03:13:19.514]  We grant them power, we can take that power away from them whenever we're courageous enough to do so.
[03:13:19.514 --> 03:13:23.217]  And in fact, it's not our right to do it, it's our duty.
[03:13:23.217 --> 03:13:26.138]  Our moral obligation, absolutely.
[03:13:26.138 --> 03:13:33.943]  If someone were attacking your child, I mean, you wouldn't stand there and go, well, come on, Tommy, lead with your left.
[03:13:33.943 --> 03:13:36.865]  You jump in and protect the child, that's your responsibility.
[03:13:37.284 --> 03:13:46.672]  Well, we also have a responsibility to protect ourselves, and it's just chilling what the government is doing these days.
[03:13:46.672 --> 03:13:54.318]  I'm sure that you've been talking about the Missouri report that has Ron Paul supporters listed as terrorists.
[03:13:54.318 --> 03:13:55.819]  Oh, we've been talking about it.
[03:13:55.819 --> 03:13:57.421]  Yeah, we broke it.
[03:13:57.421 --> 03:13:59.703]  Yeah, well, there was a young man going through St.
[03:13:59.703 --> 03:14:05.107]  Louis, and he had, you know, a couple thousand dollars on him, and they were giving him a hard time.
[03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:10.378]  I mean, I don't know what could be more blatant.
[03:14:10.378 --> 03:14:13.986]  I mean, when we say totalitarian police state, this is it.
[03:14:16.260 --> 03:14:31.388]  Well, now they're putting in all over the country body scanners that admittedly scan your naked body and put it in a database, and they want you to scan your children's naked bodies in a government database, which they then can biometrically track with cameras, because the camera then has your biometric algorithm.
[03:14:31.388 --> 03:14:33.829]  It's like getting your digital thumbprint or retina scan.
[03:14:33.829 --> 03:14:35.230]  It's a body scan, 360.
[03:14:35.230 --> 03:14:38.051]  I mean, what's next?
[03:14:38.051 --> 03:14:39.832]  It's already insanely bad.
[03:14:39.832 --> 03:14:44.454]  Now they admit, oh yeah, we've been taking all babies' blood at birth for a UN database for 36 years.
[03:14:45.635 --> 03:14:46.856]  You know, I got laughed at about that.
[03:14:46.856 --> 03:14:48.417]  Now it's in all the newspapers.
[03:14:48.417 --> 03:14:51.258]  They're now announcing they're Kim trailing us, Michael.
[03:14:51.258 --> 03:14:53.919]  They go, yeah, we're spraying you for your own good.
[03:14:53.919 --> 03:14:56.201]  We mix it with the jet fuel.
[03:14:56.201 --> 03:14:58.662]  I mean, that's in the Associated Press, Michael, today!
[03:14:58.662 --> 03:15:09.668]  I mean... I've been trying to bring people's attention to it, and my expertise is teaching people what they already know.
[03:15:09.668 --> 03:15:13.950]  And when I teach my Constitution class, people walk out of there realizing
[03:15:14.591 --> 03:15:21.573]  Just how far away we have gotten from the principles our founding fathers left us.
[03:15:21.573 --> 03:15:23.533]  That's what I wake up to every day and freak out.
[03:15:23.533 --> 03:15:37.436]  How crazy it is, the fact that they'll admit they're setting up world government with a world currency, that they're spraying us in a secret program, that they're putting, I mean, I mean, what on earth does it take to get folks angry?
[03:15:38.948 --> 03:15:44.712]  I had a gentleman call me about three weeks ago and said, Michael, America's in trouble.
[03:15:44.712 --> 03:15:45.532]  And I said, yeah.
[03:15:45.532 --> 03:15:46.993]  And he says, no, we've got to do something.
[03:15:46.993 --> 03:15:48.814]  We've got to do something now.
[03:15:48.814 --> 03:15:54.758]  And I was glad to have him on our side, but I told him that he was not going to be leading the parade.
[03:15:54.758 --> 03:15:57.359]  That ship had already left the dock.
[03:15:57.359 --> 03:16:00.221]  So I told him which websites to look at.
[03:16:00.221 --> 03:16:02.302]  But it is.
[03:16:02.302 --> 03:16:08.486]  It is finally so ridiculously crazy that your average person is
[03:16:09.235 --> 03:16:12.716]  He realizes that the government's out of control.
[03:16:12.716 --> 03:16:19.939]  All of this, the bailout and the stimulus package, all this information.
[03:16:19.939 --> 03:16:29.724]  I just brought a cab back from the airport a couple days ago, and I asked the cab driver how much of Barack Obama's stimulus package he was going to get.
[03:16:29.724 --> 03:16:31.224]  And he turned around and looked at me.
[03:16:31.224 --> 03:16:33.125]  I thought for a moment he was going to throw me out of the cab.
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:38.221]  So he was definitely angry at Lord Obama.
[03:16:38.221 --> 03:16:44.386]  We're already seeing a lot of real liberals, you know, who aren't foundation paid off by Soros or the others.
[03:16:44.386 --> 03:16:48.949]  Obama publicly is funding Acorn saying they're going to disrupt tea parties nationwide.
[03:16:48.949 --> 03:16:58.677]  I mean, people are going to protest against higher taxes and Obama is going to dispatch his paid-for group that he just gave a couple billion to out to disrupt it?
[03:16:58.677 --> 03:16:59.998]  I mean, this is getting insane!
[03:17:01.769 --> 03:17:04.111]  Well, that's exactly what Joseph Stalin did.
[03:17:04.111 --> 03:17:08.014]  You're not allowed to oppose the company line.
[03:17:08.014 --> 03:17:16.580]  The government says something that must be true, and anybody who disagrees is suspect of being, you know, a terrorist.
[03:17:16.580 --> 03:17:24.105]  And that, I wish I could say that was only a euphemism here in the United States, but that's getting to be literal.
[03:17:24.105 --> 03:17:25.486]  And I'm with you.
[03:17:25.486 --> 03:17:27.488]  If this, if being a
[03:17:28.459 --> 03:17:35.742]  Enemy of the state means that you're opposed to the taxes, opposed to the unconstitutional government, and opposed to all of this police state.
[03:17:35.742 --> 03:17:40.064]  Well, I'm happy to march shoulder-to-shoulder with you.
[03:17:40.064 --> 03:17:40.604]  Exactly.
[03:17:40.604 --> 03:17:44.065]  At this point, we're going, please stop, just like the Founders did for a decade.
[03:17:44.065 --> 03:17:45.026]  Please stop.
[03:17:45.026 --> 03:17:46.326]  Please stop.
[03:17:46.326 --> 03:17:49.027]  And we're going, this isn't going to go nice for you or us.
[03:17:49.027 --> 03:17:50.688]  This is going to be mutually destructive.
[03:17:51.485 --> 03:17:52.386]  You need to stop.
[03:17:52.386 --> 03:17:55.069]  And the government just gets crazier and crazier.
[03:17:55.069 --> 03:17:56.851]  They're all isolated in their ivory towers.
[03:17:56.851 --> 03:17:58.493]  But let me tell you who's not isolated.
[03:17:58.493 --> 03:18:00.274]  It's all their enforcers.
[03:18:00.274 --> 03:18:04.959]  And we're now reaching out to their enforcers, and their enforcers are reaching out to us going, yeah, we don't like this either.
[03:18:04.959 --> 03:18:10.705]  Because they're not all bad, and they're made up of the general public, and I don't... Michael, I gotta tell you.
[03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:12.591]  And I'll tell it like it is.
[03:18:12.591 --> 03:18:15.032]  I've really looked at this through a historical lens.
[03:18:15.032 --> 03:18:16.713]  I think the New World Order is going to fall.
[03:18:16.713 --> 03:18:18.154]  I don't think it's going to make it.
[03:18:18.154 --> 03:18:27.000]  Our biggest problem, once you speak to that, is that the phony Christian churches have been paid off by the World Council of Churches to tell their flocks it's the end of the world and to lay down.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:33.224]  So fake Christian dogma, telling folks it's the end of the world, is the only thing keeping us from beating them.
[03:18:33.224 --> 03:18:37.467]  Because then that takes your mainline conservative base and they just sit there on their thumbs.
[03:18:39.540 --> 03:18:40.281]  Well, it is.
[03:18:40.281 --> 03:18:43.083]  The New World Order is going to fall.
[03:18:43.083 --> 03:18:44.444]  That's for sure.
[03:18:44.444 --> 03:18:51.829]  Just like the sun comes up every morning, just like, you know, young people discover love, we're going to restore our constitutional republic.
[03:18:51.829 --> 03:18:57.213]  It's definitely going to get messy between now and then, because we've been asking them to stop.
[03:18:57.213 --> 03:18:59.835]  The government is going to use force.
[03:18:59.835 --> 03:19:06.240]  And Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[03:19:06.240 --> 03:19:07.141]  And I'm convinced
[03:19:07.608 --> 03:19:12.211]  That Thomas Jefferson put patriots first, because we won't pull the trigger first.
[03:19:12.211 --> 03:19:22.597]  The government will pull the trigger, they will kill us, there's going to be another event, possibly like Waco or something like that, and the American public is going to retaliate.
[03:19:22.597 --> 03:19:30.722]  And like you, I am doing everything I can to stop bloodshed, to stop violence, and I tell people that the revolution will happen.
[03:19:31.385 --> 03:19:34.827]  The only variable is how many people are on our side.
[03:19:34.827 --> 03:19:39.208]  If we can get the people to wake up, we can do a peaceful, bloodless revolution.
[03:19:45.327 --> 03:19:48.688]  But we've already exposed false flag terror, so that tool doesn't work anymore.
[03:19:48.688 --> 03:19:49.629]  Let's talk about that.
[03:19:49.629 --> 03:19:51.430]  Let's talk about strategy with Michael McNairing.
[03:19:51.430 --> 03:19:53.210]  Got more chemtrail news coming up.
[03:19:53.210 --> 03:19:58.653]  I won't have time to debunk Glenn Beck, but I'm gonna do it tonight with Burmess.
[03:19:58.653 --> 03:20:00.093]  There's a new Glenn Beck hit piece.
[03:20:00.093 --> 03:20:01.074]  It's worse than the last.
[03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:05.165]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[03:20:05.165 --> 03:20:09.609]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[03:20:09.609 --> 03:20:13.932]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[03:20:13.932 --> 03:20:16.114]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[03:20:16.114 --> 03:20:20.897]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[03:20:20.897 --> 03:20:27.803]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[03:20:27.803 --> 03:20:29.004]  One Florida customer says,
[03:20:29.463 --> 03:20:38.068]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery.
[03:20:38.068 --> 03:20:42.730]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:46.072]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[03:20:46.072 --> 03:20:48.313]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com.
[03:20:48.313 --> 03:20:49.694]  That's 9voltlite.com.
[03:20:50.434 --> 03:20:52.437]  Or call us today toll free at 877-715-4448.
[03:20:52.437 --> 03:20:52.777]  That's 877-715-4448.
[03:20:52.777 --> 03:20:56.621]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.212 --> 03:21:14.076]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.076 --> 03:21:20.581]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.581 --> 03:21:22.562]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.562 --> 03:21:25.024]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.024 --> 03:21:35.912]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.203 --> 03:21:39.864]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.864 --> 03:21:41.725]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.725 --> 03:21:48.649]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.649 --> 03:21:56.894]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.894 --> 03:21:58.475]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.475 --> 03:22:01.877]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.877 --> 03:22:04.559]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[03:22:04.977 --> 03:22:11.543]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[03:22:11.543 --> 03:22:16.827]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[03:22:16.827 --> 03:22:26.376]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[03:22:26.792 --> 03:22:36.862]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[03:22:36.862 --> 03:22:44.249]  Call me Dwayne Dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[03:22:44.249 --> 03:22:48.213]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.

[03:23:08.461 --> 03:23:13.005]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[03:23:37.391 --> 03:23:42.858]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[03:24:04.301 --> 03:24:06.884]  We just got a Virginia fusion center.
[03:24:06.884 --> 03:24:09.546]  That's a federalization FEMA takeover of the government.
[03:24:09.546 --> 03:24:12.009]  When you hear fusion center, that's what it is.
[03:24:12.009 --> 03:24:15.192]  It's a fusion center that put out the MIAC report we broke.
[03:24:15.192 --> 03:24:21.378]  Infowars.com is now breaking worldwide a 200 plus page internal fusion center document.
[03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:28.333]  And you want to read, we've been reading over this last hour, it is unbelievable.
[03:24:28.333 --> 03:24:30.275]  Nightmare after nightmare of demonization.
[03:24:30.275 --> 03:24:34.678]  You thought MYAC was bad, this is breaking right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:24:34.678 --> 03:24:40.141]  Huge news breaking at PrisonPlanet.com, it's sister site, twin titan in the InfoWars.
[03:24:40.141 --> 03:24:43.023]  I just love, I love fighting the globalists.
[03:24:43.023 --> 03:24:50.569]  It feels so good to fight scumbag parasite tyranny and to see them being routed over and over again when good people just take the field.
[03:24:51.923 --> 03:24:55.666]  I'm going to have Burmus come in in about 10 minutes to quick pop in with some of the nightmares that are in this.
[03:24:55.666 --> 03:24:57.387]  He's been scanning over it the last 30 minutes.
[03:24:57.387 --> 03:25:01.229]  200-something pages, you know, our reading assignment.
[03:25:01.229 --> 03:25:08.674]  Imagine having homework that never ends, that you have a passion for, because you want knowledge and to beat them.
[03:25:08.674 --> 03:25:10.295]  It's like you can't stop.
[03:25:10.295 --> 03:25:11.496]  You can't stop researching.
[03:25:11.496 --> 03:25:12.517]  You can't stop learning.
[03:25:12.517 --> 03:25:16.800]  You can't stop finding out what's disinfo and what's real.
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:18.741]  What has this journey been like for you?
[03:25:18.741 --> 03:25:21.663]  Because, you know, you sprouted out of Austin as well as a lot of folks.
[03:25:22.723 --> 03:25:27.485]  Yeah, well it's been, well it certainly hasn't been boring.
[03:25:27.485 --> 03:25:43.970]  I've been on the road, well, since 2003, two years on the presidential campaign, two years for the congressional campaign, and ever since the presidential election, interest in my Constitution class has been skyrocketing.
[03:25:43.970 --> 03:25:48.651]  People are finally deciding that they need to learn a little bit about the Constitution.
[03:25:49.481 --> 03:25:52.264]  And I've got a special deal for your listeners.
[03:25:52.264 --> 03:25:57.468]  I'll be teaching my Constitution class in Philadelphia on Sunday, April 26th.
[03:25:57.468 --> 03:26:04.414]  They're having an end the Fed rally in Philadelphia on Saturday.
[03:26:04.414 --> 03:26:09.959]  My class will be on Sunday, and I'm offering your listeners a $15 discount.
[03:26:09.959 --> 03:26:11.400]  Normally it's $100.
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:16.164]  They can take the class for $85, and all they have to do is type in
[03:26:17.643 --> 03:26:19.263]  Long live the Republic.
[03:26:19.263 --> 03:26:26.886]  There's a button, a PayPal button on my website, constitutionpreservation.org.
[03:26:26.886 --> 03:26:42.530]  That's right, and nobody teaches it like you do, because I've done a lot of research on it, and your analysis and the way you present it is just stunning, and also very charismatic, and don't you have a film as well with a presentation, very well done, going over, you know, what's happening?
[03:26:43.715 --> 03:26:48.799]  Well, the original class that I taught is on the internet.
[03:26:48.799 --> 03:26:54.403]  I actually taught that class in Houston, Texas on September 9th, 2001.
[03:26:54.403 --> 03:26:59.086]  I mean, clearly I had no idea that anything was going to happen in New York.
[03:26:59.554 --> 03:27:04.878]  But that's been posted all over the internet, probably 30 or 40 different sites by now.
[03:27:04.878 --> 03:27:06.660]  Yeah, millions of views.
[03:27:06.660 --> 03:27:10.043]  Yeah, I have a 12-hour version.
[03:27:10.043 --> 03:27:11.124]  It's a little bit prettier.
[03:27:11.124 --> 03:27:15.247]  I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and we sell my book with that.
[03:27:15.247 --> 03:27:20.732]  So that's all available on the homepage at constitutionpreservation.org.
[03:27:20.732 --> 03:27:21.232]  Alright, good.
[03:27:21.232 --> 03:27:22.153]  Folks, you should check that out.
[03:27:22.153 --> 03:27:24.315]  Now, government-sponsored terror.
[03:27:25.285 --> 03:27:28.247]  You know, they caught the Denver Police staging attacks on police last year.
[03:27:28.247 --> 03:27:29.909]  Denver Post, the police admit it.
[03:27:29.909 --> 03:27:30.689]  We catch them all the time.
[03:27:30.689 --> 03:27:31.830]  That's a form of false flag.
[03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:36.574]  It's where you do something bad for those who don't know and blame it on your political enemies.
[03:27:36.574 --> 03:27:38.795]  Clearly, Ivan, I want to see if you disagree or agree.
[03:27:38.795 --> 03:27:42.478]  Obama is... his agenda is dying.
[03:27:42.478 --> 03:27:44.560]  The hype is wearing off even quicker than we had hoped.
[03:27:45.515 --> 03:27:46.835]  But then that goes into phase two.
[03:27:46.835 --> 03:27:48.096]  They're going to stage terror.
[03:27:48.096 --> 03:27:49.056]  Maybe even a big war.
[03:27:49.056 --> 03:27:50.957]  Rand Corporation says they want that.
[03:27:50.957 --> 03:27:52.517]  Israel's saying they may hit Iran.
[03:27:52.517 --> 03:27:54.177]  They may release bird flu.
[03:27:54.177 --> 03:27:57.138]  We've confirmed with government documents they are building mass graves everywhere.
[03:27:57.138 --> 03:27:59.439]  The story's confirmed.
[03:27:59.439 --> 03:28:02.060]  They've got to have a mass crisis to get this going.
[03:28:02.060 --> 03:28:05.661]  It could be start rioting or kill a bunch of cops and say we did it.
[03:28:05.661 --> 03:28:08.221]  That's in Operation Northwoods.
[03:28:08.221 --> 03:28:09.222]  What do you see happening?
[03:28:09.222 --> 03:28:13.403]  Because they're not going to get their agenda through without staging some big events.
[03:28:15.371 --> 03:28:18.972]  You know, they've got so many options.
[03:28:18.972 --> 03:28:23.573]  I really don't know what they are planning to do.
[03:28:23.573 --> 03:28:26.973]  Any of those things make me suspicious.
[03:28:26.973 --> 03:28:36.715]  You know, any large disaster, you know, I'm automatically trying to imagine if that would be, you know, an act of God or an act of an insane government.
[03:28:36.715 --> 03:28:38.396]  But you're absolutely correct.
[03:28:38.396 --> 03:28:43.177]  They're going to... Well, the economy's already crashing.
[03:28:43.177 --> 03:28:44.277]  We're kind of in the middle of that.
[03:28:45.001 --> 03:28:46.562]  Food is going to become scarce.
[03:28:46.562 --> 03:28:52.246]  People are going to be running through the neighborhood looking for their neighbor's last jar of peanut butter.
[03:28:52.246 --> 03:28:56.929]  And we are going to have what they gently call civil unrest.
[03:28:56.929 --> 03:28:59.490]  Well, that's rioting in the street.
[03:28:59.490 --> 03:29:04.594]  And that's all the excuse they're going to need to bring in their troops, all of the
[03:29:05.456 --> 03:29:06.657]  I don't know.
[03:29:18.920 --> 03:29:25.284]  I just know that it's probably going to, and I've got all the people that listen to me ready for it.
[03:29:25.284 --> 03:29:40.234]  We're storing food, we've converted our paper money to silver and gold, and I went to Walmart personally looking for ammunition, and the woman told me that they get a shipment every three or four days.
[03:29:40.234 --> 03:29:44.197]  They don't put it on the shelf, they put it on a cart, and it's gone in two hours.
[03:29:47.981 --> 03:29:49.081]  Oh boy, folks.
[03:29:49.081 --> 03:29:51.982]  People deep down know what's coming.
[03:29:51.982 --> 03:29:53.382]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.382 --> 03:29:55.903]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.903 --> 03:30:01.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.945 --> 03:30:03.305]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[03:30:03.305 --> 03:30:09.867]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:30:09.867 --> 03:30:11.487]  If you're a politician who voted for the
[03:30:17.200 --> 03:30:26.043]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:30:26.043 --> 03:30:32.405]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[03:30:32.405 --> 03:30:36.026]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[03:30:36.026 --> 03:30:40.428]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[03:30:40.428 --> 03:30:41.148]  For the rest of you,
[03:30:44.991 --> 03:30:46.713]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:31:05.359 --> 03:31:07.983]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.983 --> 03:31:15.013]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.575 --> 03:31:22.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.160 --> 03:31:24.141]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.141 --> 03:31:26.643]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.643 --> 03:31:38.211]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.211 --> 03:31:39.892]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.892 --> 03:31:41.253]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.733 --> 03:31:48.641]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:58.492]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.492 --> 03:31:59.674]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.912 --> 03:32:05.433]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:32:05.433 --> 03:32:10.834]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:32:10.834 --> 03:32:15.995]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:32:15.995 --> 03:32:27.098]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:32:27.498 --> 03:32:33.280]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:32:33.280 --> 03:32:39.543]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:32:39.543 --> 03:32:40.583]  What about you?
[03:32:40.583 --> 03:32:42.524]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:32:56.726 --> 03:32:57.986]  Crying on the corner, waiting in the rain,
[03:33:38.143 --> 03:33:38.964]  I just love it.
[03:33:38.964 --> 03:33:39.604]  I love life.
[03:33:39.604 --> 03:33:43.827]  You know, all this terrible stuff's happening and it would be horrible if I wasn't fighting it.
[03:33:43.827 --> 03:33:46.429]  But at least I know the truth and I'm fighting them.
[03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:48.591]  And whatever happens, I know I was on the side of good.
[03:33:48.591 --> 03:33:51.053]  I know I told the truth.
[03:33:51.053 --> 03:33:52.054]  I know I was for real.
[03:33:53.137 --> 03:33:56.159]  And the enemy, they're phonies, they're fakes, they have no honor.
[03:33:56.159 --> 03:34:01.041]  That's why they try to pull us down and badmouth us and lie about us from all angles.
[03:34:01.041 --> 03:34:10.866]  Because they know in all this darkness and all these lies, those of you out there that stand up for truth and justice and honesty, that you shine like a white light and they just can't stand it.
[03:34:10.866 --> 03:34:13.727]  So they try to pull us down and say we're not for real, we're for real.
[03:34:13.727 --> 03:34:15.488]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:34:15.488 --> 03:34:16.209]  And look at the fruits.
[03:34:17.029 --> 03:34:22.239]  The awakening that's happening through this radio show and my films alone and now other people becoming leaders.
[03:34:22.239 --> 03:34:25.304]  We're going back to Michael Bagner in just a moment, but I wanted to bring up Gary King.
[03:34:26.462 --> 03:34:30.583]  Gary King heard me say get a radio show years ago.
[03:34:30.583 --> 03:34:34.504]  And then I guess he made a pilgrimage or something to our office one day, sat outside, went out and talked to him.
[03:34:34.504 --> 03:34:37.985]  Unfortunately, I had like 50 people doing that a day, so I had to move offices.
[03:34:37.985 --> 03:34:43.026]  But I did meet with him, hung out with him, had a cup of coffee with him, and said, yeah, keep doing your radio show, great job.
[03:34:43.026 --> 03:34:46.287]  And since then, about a year ago, it's just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.
[03:34:46.287 --> 03:34:48.408]  And so I wanted him to briefly give you a testimony.
[03:34:48.408 --> 03:34:53.749]  He's on 990 AM out of New Orleans, and to tell you about his show and how popular it's gotten.
[03:34:54.329 --> 03:34:55.591]  And this is what you can do.
[03:34:55.591 --> 03:34:56.913]  And he had to pay for it at first.
[03:34:56.913 --> 03:34:58.995]  Now he has sponsors and it pays for itself.
[03:34:58.995 --> 03:35:01.399]  But that's how you get your break.
[03:35:01.399 --> 03:35:02.400]  And don't wait.
[03:35:02.400 --> 03:35:03.481]  Just do it.
[03:35:03.481 --> 03:35:05.284]  Briefly, because I don't want to cut into Bagnaric's time here.
[03:35:05.284 --> 03:35:08.788]  Michael Bagnaric, Gary King, tell folks about what's happened with you.
[03:35:10.346 --> 03:35:13.767]  Well, just like I heard you say one time, you said, look, get your own radio show.
[03:35:13.767 --> 03:35:15.247]  It doesn't cost that much.
[03:35:15.247 --> 03:35:20.048]  So I did that and I'm going to tell everyone else who has a little talent and feel they can do it.
[03:35:20.048 --> 03:35:21.289]  And my show is pre-recorded.
[03:35:21.289 --> 03:35:24.469]  So when I stutter and stumble, I just go back and redo it.
[03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:34.052]  So just, you know, get off your booty and get your own radio show because we're breaking news all the time because Alex isn't on in New Orleans.
[03:35:34.052 --> 03:35:35.572]  So I went ahead and got my own show.
[03:35:35.572 --> 03:35:36.672]  I plug him all the time.
[03:35:36.672 --> 03:35:37.112]  You know what?
[03:35:37.112 --> 03:35:38.133]  I'm going to make a t-shirt.
[03:35:38.133 --> 03:35:39.113]  I'm going to make a t-shirt.
[03:35:39.753 --> 03:35:41.033]  Get off your booty!
[03:35:41.033 --> 03:35:43.054]  InfoWars.com.
[03:35:43.054 --> 03:35:45.375]  There you go.
[03:35:45.375 --> 03:35:49.997]  So just go ahead and get your own show and you can make it happen like that.
[03:35:49.997 --> 03:35:51.577]  We cover 9-11.
[03:35:51.577 --> 03:35:53.618]  I'm really doing some Katrina research.
[03:35:53.618 --> 03:36:02.681]  New Orleans has really paid a hard price from New World Order and we're going to bring evidence about FEMA blowing the levees really soon.
[03:36:02.681 --> 03:36:05.322]  Oh, they did that before, so that's confirmed.
[03:36:05.322 --> 03:36:07.323]  Now, plug what time your show's on, 9-90.
[03:36:08.570 --> 03:36:30.948]  Okay if you don't want to catch the podcast at any time but you go to WGSO 990 AM now the live shows from 4 to 5 on Wednesdays but just go to the website and then hit podcast and then it'll say Patriot Radio and then my last four shows are on there and I'm a musician and I'm a Cajun guitar playing Cajun from cutoff and um
[03:36:31.747 --> 03:36:39.851]  Just go there and listen to him because I'm a musician and I put music, there's music playing all the time and it always has to do with the topic this relates to.
[03:36:39.851 --> 03:36:41.132]  Alright, good job.
[03:36:41.132 --> 03:36:42.033]  Everybody do it.
[03:36:42.033 --> 03:36:42.833]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:36:42.833 --> 03:36:43.593]  You bet.
[03:36:43.593 --> 03:36:44.114]  Absolutely.
[03:36:44.114 --> 03:36:45.414]  We love the Coonasses.
[03:36:45.414 --> 03:36:46.195]  They are great people.
[03:36:46.195 --> 03:36:47.556]  That's what they call themselves.
[03:36:47.556 --> 03:36:49.557]  I've got some family that are Coonasses.
[03:36:49.557 --> 03:36:52.418]  Alright, there's people in the office that are Coonasses.
[03:36:52.418 --> 03:36:54.019]  Anyways, that's the term, folks.
[03:36:54.019 --> 03:36:56.741]  You can say ass, it means a donkey.
[03:36:56.741 --> 03:36:59.422]  Great folks down there and we appreciate them coming on the show.
[03:36:59.422 --> 03:37:00.883]  Okay, going back to Michael Bagnerik.
[03:37:01.883 --> 03:37:07.325]  Michael, continuing with what you were going over, this is all coming to a head.
[03:37:07.325 --> 03:37:08.325]  I mean, this is it.
[03:37:08.325 --> 03:37:12.346]  This is the time in history, and they've openly announced world government.
[03:37:12.346 --> 03:37:24.990]  How ridiculous is it, though, what do you call this double think or double speak, where they announce there's a world government, a world currency run by banks, exactly what we said it would be, but that it doesn't exist at the same time when we criticize it and we're crazy?
[03:37:30.232 --> 03:37:32.834]  In 1984, they called it doublespeak.
[03:37:32.834 --> 03:37:34.355]  You know, war is peace.
[03:37:34.355 --> 03:37:36.936]  You know, weakness is strength.
[03:37:36.936 --> 03:37:39.077]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:37:39.077 --> 03:37:45.181]  I never thought, when I was reading that book in high school, that we would come this close to it.
[03:37:45.181 --> 03:37:52.725]  But I never thought that we'd have a Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, the Homegrown Terrorism Act.
[03:37:52.725 --> 03:37:56.547]  If you told me ten years ago, Alex, that those documents would exist,
[03:37:57.105 --> 03:37:58.226]  I disagree with you.
[03:37:58.226 --> 03:38:03.070]  You know, Alex, you're a great guy, but the American people would never let it get that bad.
[03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:04.571]  Well, we have.
[03:38:04.571 --> 03:38:10.896]  And people are finally, finally starting to realize just how far out of control it is.
[03:38:10.896 --> 03:38:17.001]  The problem is that they've waited so long, now they're starting to feel like it's hopeless.
[03:38:17.001 --> 03:38:18.382]  But that is not true.
[03:38:18.382 --> 03:38:20.724]  We are having an effect.
[03:38:20.724 --> 03:38:26.669]  Your presence in the radio and in your videos has had a tremendous effect.
[03:38:27.789 --> 03:38:32.633]  My mother has watched your videos and passed them out to friends of hers.
[03:38:32.633 --> 03:38:33.014]  Oh, good.
[03:38:33.014 --> 03:38:38.299]  So, yeah, I mean, we really are having a huge movement right now.
[03:38:38.299 --> 03:38:48.328]  People are, you know, coming over, you know, to realize that, you know, the government has been lying to us, spending us into oblivion.
[03:38:49.899 --> 03:38:56.186]  And, you know, those of us who have been here, we've just got to give the new people a little bit of time to get their balance.
[03:38:56.186 --> 03:38:59.469]  Because we have taken a long time to learn this.
[03:38:59.469 --> 03:39:02.192]  It's kind of obvious to us.
[03:39:02.192 --> 03:39:09.078]  But for these new people, it is such a shock to their system to realize just how far the deception has gone.
[03:39:09.078 --> 03:39:11.641]  Well, think of the magnitude that we've known.
[03:39:12.802 --> 03:39:14.564]  Those aren't ice crystal trails.
[03:39:14.564 --> 03:39:15.725]  They're staying there for hours.
[03:39:15.725 --> 03:39:17.307]  They're turning into clouds.
[03:39:17.307 --> 03:39:18.448]  What is that plane?
[03:39:18.448 --> 03:39:19.189]  Is it spraying it?
[03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:20.850]  But that one right by it is.
[03:39:20.850 --> 03:39:22.952]  And now the president just goes, yeah, we're spraying you.
[03:39:22.952 --> 03:39:24.234]  It's for your own good.
[03:39:24.234 --> 03:39:25.035]  It's classified.
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:29.444]  It's classified, you know, and for our own good.
[03:39:29.444 --> 03:39:31.947]  I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them.
[03:39:45.302 --> 03:39:48.024]  I start wondering what other crazy stuff may be true.
[03:39:48.024 --> 03:39:49.805]  Because I've always known something's wrong.
[03:39:49.805 --> 03:39:51.907]  My whole life I grew up and trails weren't like that.
[03:39:51.907 --> 03:39:55.229]  And I grew up, you know, near an airport by Dallas.
[03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:58.471]  And suddenly, you know, but you always kind of had a nagging thing.
[03:39:58.471 --> 03:40:01.433]  Well, the government admits some of it, but maybe I'm just, maybe I am.
[03:40:01.433 --> 03:40:03.975]  And then the president comes out and goes, yeah, we're spraying you.
[03:40:03.975 --> 03:40:05.316]  You know, I mean, you want to believe.
[03:40:05.316 --> 03:40:07.678]  I mean, Mike, do you ever want to believe this stuff isn't real?
[03:40:09.142 --> 03:40:14.427]  Yes, because if it is real, then we are in so much trouble.
[03:40:14.427 --> 03:40:17.829]  And I think that's where most people get their denial.
[03:40:17.829 --> 03:40:22.053]  It's like, Alex, no way that they can have all these concentration camps.
[03:40:22.053 --> 03:40:23.994]  No way they're digging graves.
[03:40:23.994 --> 03:40:28.758]  And if that's true, you know, we are really in deep, deep, serious trouble.
[03:40:28.758 --> 03:40:34.002]  And I might have to get, you know, turn off the wheel of fortune and start to do something about it.
[03:40:34.002 --> 03:40:35.784]  But over the years,
[03:40:36.795 --> 03:40:39.378]  I've watched people across the country.
[03:40:39.378 --> 03:40:46.726]  My presidential campaign allowed me to travel to all 48 of the lower, you know, continental states.
[03:40:46.726 --> 03:40:52.873]  And people are all over, in Oregon and Washington and California, everywhere.
[03:40:52.873 --> 03:40:53.714]  They've got groups.
[03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:56.431]  We're just as passionate as you and I are.
[03:40:56.431 --> 03:41:01.313]  They're doing good work, and then they go, we're the only ones fighting for liberty.
[03:41:01.313 --> 03:41:03.233]  It's like, are you crazy?
[03:41:03.233 --> 03:41:06.215]  No, no, because they're all compartmentalized.
[03:41:06.215 --> 03:41:08.215]  Let me make a point, and I want your take on this.
[03:41:08.215 --> 03:41:14.878]  The Burmese is going to come in with some breaking news on a new gigantic fusion center secret report we just got in our little hands.
[03:41:14.878 --> 03:41:16.779]  Mass graves, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:41:18.291 --> 03:41:30.378]  Glenn Beck's now saying he's going to debunk mass graves because he's a patriot and we can trust him and then he's going to stab us all in the back and go show the few straw men FEMA camps that weren't real that I predicted he would show.
[03:41:30.378 --> 03:41:38.223]  Well now with the mass graves he's going to go out and show the few cases that were wrong because everybody's looking into this now and people are becoming citizen journalists.
[03:41:38.223 --> 03:41:39.403]  They're going to get it wrong.
[03:41:39.403 --> 03:41:43.666]  I haven't seen any fake cases yet so I don't know what he's going to pick but he'll find one.
[03:41:44.506 --> 03:41:47.413]  He's now announced that on the radio yesterday, I'm told, by a good source.
[03:41:47.413 --> 03:41:49.839]  But, uh, Mass Graves.
[03:41:49.839 --> 03:41:51.743]  Now, here is the Rocky Mountain News.
[03:41:51.743 --> 03:41:53.106]  Now, I remembered this.
[03:41:53.106 --> 03:41:54.329]  Plugged it on air and people found it.
[03:41:55.996 --> 03:42:01.778]  InsideDenver.com, this was by Jim Erickson, Rocky Mountain News, February 8, 2003.
[03:42:01.778 --> 03:42:04.559]  Rocky Mountain News exists.
[03:42:04.559 --> 03:42:06.019]  Jim Erickson exists.
[03:42:06.019 --> 03:42:11.941]  I was mailed the actual newspaper by a listener when this happened in 2003, and then I Googled it and found it.
[03:42:11.941 --> 03:42:17.242]  So somewhere around here, stuff piles up, we have the Rocky... Denver exists.
[03:42:17.242 --> 03:42:18.763]  Rocky Mountain News exists.
[03:42:18.763 --> 03:42:20.463]  Colorado exists.
[03:42:20.463 --> 03:42:21.623]  It's in the Rocky Mountains.
[03:42:21.623 --> 03:42:22.944]  People deny all this, so let me explain.
[03:42:24.361 --> 03:42:28.064]  Mike, back there, there is a place called Colorado, right?
[03:42:28.064 --> 03:42:29.905]  Absolutely, I've been there and campaigned there.
[03:42:29.905 --> 03:42:35.769]  Okay, we promise you folks, we're not making, I know Glenn Beck will say it in real, but, and I'm not even being satirical now.
[03:42:35.769 --> 03:42:41.012]  Okay, Colorado exists, the Rocky Mountain News is a major paper, correct?
[03:42:41.012 --> 03:42:41.813]  Yes.
[03:42:41.813 --> 03:42:47.196]  Okay, now this says incinerators and mass graves, okay?
[03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:50.592]  And this is 2003!
[03:42:50.592 --> 03:42:59.521]  The state of Colorado could seize antibiotics, cremate disease-ridden corpses, and under extreme circumstances, dig mass graves under executive orders drafted for the use in the event of bioterrorism.
[03:42:59.521 --> 03:43:07.430]  Then they had public training for years, getting ready for forced inoculations, mass graves, and then we got from the state of New York, where they're telling all the
[03:43:08.769 --> 03:43:15.352]  And doing surveys to bury, what, 900 and something bodies per acre, where they can bury the bodies for a flu outbreak.
[03:43:15.352 --> 03:43:22.016]  We put these documents on air, and we've got all these other mainstream news stories, but then the news says we're liars.
[03:43:22.016 --> 03:43:25.357]  None of this exists, Mike.
[03:43:25.357 --> 03:43:38.364]  Well, if disinformation, if they can contradict, if the average person hears you and I talking about mass graves, and then they read another report that says, no, there are no mass graves, it's a, it's a fallacy.
[03:43:39.784 --> 03:43:44.325]  The answer they want to believe, they want to believe that there are no mass graves.
[03:43:44.325 --> 03:43:53.347]  And so, you know, the person without any more information than that is going to, you know, lean in the direction of, oh, you know, Michael and Alex, they're just exaggerating.
[03:43:53.347 --> 03:43:54.127]  They're on the radio.
[03:43:54.127 --> 03:43:56.708]  They're trying to create names for themselves.
[03:43:56.708 --> 03:43:59.848]  When, I mean, all this stuff is true.
[03:43:59.848 --> 03:44:00.488]  Absolutely.
[03:44:00.488 --> 03:44:07.990]  You were reporting on black helicopters down at the Gulf Coast of Texas, and I happen to have a friend living there.
[03:44:09.907 --> 03:44:12.508]  I called and I said, you know, I just heard a report.
[03:44:12.508 --> 03:44:13.949]  And she goes, yeah, I saw those.
[03:44:13.949 --> 03:44:15.689]  I wondered what they were doing.
[03:44:15.689 --> 03:44:23.392]  And so I had, you know, like secondhand confirmation, somebody who had seen those black helicopters down in South Texas personally.
[03:44:23.392 --> 03:44:25.293]  So this stuff does happen.
[03:44:25.293 --> 03:44:26.614]  It is happening.
[03:44:26.614 --> 03:44:32.316]  I mean, we don't have to invent a trillion dollar bailout.
[03:44:32.316 --> 03:44:35.477]  And let me just give a quick analysis for your listeners.
[03:44:36.196 --> 03:44:37.257]  One inch.
[03:44:37.257 --> 03:44:38.497]  Little tiny one inch.
[03:44:38.497 --> 03:44:40.979]  You put 12 of them together, you get a foot.
[03:44:40.979 --> 03:44:45.041]  You put a million of them together, that's 15.7 miles.
[03:44:45.041 --> 03:44:50.184]  A billion is 15,700 miles, which is a little more than halfway around the world.
[03:44:50.184 --> 03:44:52.345]  A trillion inches is 633 laps around the equator.
[03:44:52.345 --> 03:44:52.425]  That
[03:45:01.938 --> 03:45:10.723]  A lot of interest, and Barack Obama is just casually throwing a trillion of your dollars here, a trillion of your dollars there.
[03:45:10.723 --> 03:45:23.230]  But even better, 12.8 trillion in the last six months, that's $200 billion short of the GDP, so 12.8 trillion, so in a year it'll be $26 trillion by that math, or to be technical, $25.6 trillion.
[03:45:27.748 --> 03:45:30.750]  $25.6 trillion in one year, and they're saying they're expanding it.
[03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:37.754]  That's double the GDP of the country, and then he has the nerve to say, I'm going to balance the budget in one year.
[03:45:37.754 --> 03:45:45.458]  When Bush tripled the size of government in eight years, Obama is doubling that in the first year, Mike.
[03:45:45.458 --> 03:45:47.520]  I mean, this is just, it's all over.
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:49.180]  Go ahead.
[03:45:49.180 --> 03:45:55.244]  I don't think that we could physically put $12 trillion on an aircraft carrier.
[03:45:56.560 --> 03:46:02.324]  I think the aircraft carrier would sink with 12 trillion paper dollars on it.
[03:46:02.324 --> 03:46:12.810]  We'd have to do the calculations to see that, but I mean, just to give your listeners some understanding of, I mean, this boggles the imagination.
[03:46:12.810 --> 03:46:19.654]  And as if you can call anything with 12 zeros left of the decimal point a budget.
[03:46:20.174 --> 03:46:21.735]  Mike, this is too important.
[03:46:21.735 --> 03:46:23.756]  We're going to do overdrive today, man.
[03:46:23.756 --> 03:46:25.137]  So stand by for overdrive.
[03:46:25.137 --> 03:46:28.919]  Mike, I'll have to call you back on your line in 15 minutes on our studio.
[03:46:28.919 --> 03:46:34.962]  Let's do 20 minutes of overdrive so we have time to take all these calls that never got a chance to get on air.
[03:46:34.962 --> 03:46:36.103]  So get me the studio number.
[03:46:36.103 --> 03:46:41.486]  I'm going to give that out, and we're going to keep back in there at 20 minutes over because Jason Bermas, breaking news, come on down.
[03:46:42.892 --> 03:46:47.254]  And that means we're going to continue on at InfoWars.com, TheStreams, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:46:47.254 --> 03:46:50.915]  Twenty minutes in the next hour with Michael Bagnerik, and the breaking chemtrail news.
[03:46:50.915 --> 03:46:52.816]  I mean, this is all off the charts.
[03:46:52.816 --> 03:46:59.219]  And again, we had government documents a year ago where they finally admitted, yes, we're manipulating the atmosphere for your own good.
[03:46:59.219 --> 03:47:03.681]  But we won't say what we're doing, but we already reverse-engineered it and know what they're doing.
[03:47:03.681 --> 03:47:04.802]  At least one of the programs.
[03:47:04.802 --> 03:47:08.623]  But I mean, to have AP admitting this, this is a day long remembered.
[03:47:08.623 --> 03:47:12.245]  I mean, you know, and the attacks that are happening right now,
[03:47:14.215 --> 03:47:27.484]  It gives me, actually, a great feeling of satisfaction because it means we are just... I mean, you don't want to admit to yourself that your operation and what you've built is literally part of history now, and that... and it's also scary.
[03:47:27.484 --> 03:47:30.967]  I mean, because... it's just getting...
[03:47:32.063 --> 03:47:35.345]  I've always tried to not make it about me, because Michael, you're a smart guy.
[03:47:35.345 --> 03:47:37.547]  You know that that means it makes you a target.
[03:47:37.547 --> 03:47:47.694]  It's also not good for the movement overall, because you want to have lots of leaders, and we do have that now, but they're trying to make me the leader so they can crush me and think that will decapitate things.
[03:47:47.694 --> 03:47:48.295]  It's not going to work.
[03:47:50.456 --> 03:47:53.039]  I don't know, I just grew up as a kid and never thought I'd be in this position.
[03:47:53.039 --> 03:47:55.903]  Jason, you've got major breaking news.
[03:47:55.903 --> 03:47:58.246]  Major breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:47:58.246 --> 03:48:01.069]  Curt Nemo has got it up on Infowars.com.
[03:48:01.069 --> 03:48:03.472]  We broke the MIAC report and now we've got this.
[03:48:03.472 --> 03:48:07.517]  Yeah, this is the 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment Report.
[03:48:07.737 --> 03:48:08.098]  I don't
[03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:32.562]  Every other facet of life.
[03:48:32.562 --> 03:48:34.743]  Every group is an extremist group.
[03:48:34.743 --> 03:48:40.547]  They're using colleges, correctional facilities, the internet to recruit people and they're all terrorists.
[03:48:40.547 --> 03:48:50.833]  Look, here are some of the, I haven't even gotten this far because this is page 60, lone wolf extremists, militia extremists, special interest extremism.
[03:48:50.833 --> 03:48:52.414]  Now if you're part of a special interest group,
[03:48:52.594 --> 03:48:53.454]  You're also a terrorist.
[03:48:53.454 --> 03:48:59.318]  Well, they have state police under Homeland Security Federalization spying on bike rights groups that want bike lanes.
[03:48:59.318 --> 03:49:02.459]  Spying on groups that don't want landfills.
[03:49:02.459 --> 03:49:05.241]  As terrorists, and they list, this is in the news.
[03:49:05.241 --> 03:49:09.923]  So, we're going to continue after the break with this, and we're going to go over to Michael Bagnerik.
[03:49:09.923 --> 03:49:10.984]  This is desperation.
[03:49:10.984 --> 03:49:21.550]  They're trying to demonize and create a chilling effect because they know we are waking the people up and that freedom is becoming the majority paradigm.
[03:49:21.550 --> 03:49:22.070]  Correct, Michael?
[03:49:23.302 --> 03:49:27.765]  Absolutely, I agree, and I will hang with you as long as you're willing to keep me on the air.
[03:49:27.765 --> 03:49:28.445]  I'm here.
[03:49:28.445 --> 03:49:36.350]  Okay, give us your take, though, on the fact that they're trying to demonize patriots with these Mayak-type reports, and now this Virginia Fusion Center report.
[03:49:36.350 --> 03:49:37.271]  Well, of course.
[03:49:37.271 --> 03:49:41.033]  I mean, that's what Adolf Hitler did to demonize the Jews.
[03:49:41.033 --> 03:49:43.234]  He started with newspaper articles.
[03:49:43.234 --> 03:49:46.837]  Anything bad that happened, it had to be caused by the Jews.
[03:49:46.837 --> 03:49:52.340]  And that wasn't true, but if you say it, you get people thinking in that direction.
[03:49:53.073 --> 03:49:54.773]  And then they move.
[03:49:54.773 --> 03:49:58.634]  Your website is InfoWars.com.
[03:49:58.634 --> 03:50:03.055]  I teach my class that we are in an ideological war.
[03:50:03.055 --> 03:50:04.876]  A war of ideas.
[03:50:04.876 --> 03:50:10.017]  And it's a war of individual rights versus this collectivist activity.
[03:50:10.017 --> 03:50:15.078]  And the other team is winning because we're not sure how they're fighting the war.
[03:50:15.078 --> 03:50:17.598]  They change definitions.
[03:50:17.598 --> 03:50:20.739]  They just keep promoting the same lies over and over again.
[03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:26.971]  And I don't remember who it was, but they said if you tell a lie often enough, people are going to believe it.
[03:50:26.971 --> 03:50:27.371]  It was Hedler.
[03:50:27.371 --> 03:50:28.791]  It was Hedler.
[03:50:28.791 --> 03:50:29.871]  You know?
[03:50:29.871 --> 03:50:33.252]  So, that's exactly what they're doing.
[03:50:33.252 --> 03:50:34.853]  And I'm rather proud.
[03:50:34.853 --> 03:50:45.496]  I had the Anti-Defamation League include me on a list of right-wing extremists and racists because I presented in Florida recently.
[03:50:47.932 --> 03:50:49.414]  Well, now they list Lou Dobbs.
[03:50:49.414 --> 03:50:51.397]  I've got that in the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:50:51.397 --> 03:50:52.920]  They basically say he's a terrorist.
[03:50:52.920 --> 03:50:56.686]  I mean, they've just discredited them themselves.
[03:50:56.686 --> 03:50:59.450]  That's all these idiots are doing is discrediting themselves.
[03:50:59.450 --> 03:51:00.511]  Everybody's laughing at this.
[03:51:01.929 --> 03:51:05.032]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:51:05.032 --> 03:51:10.537]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:51:10.537 --> 03:51:16.262]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:51:16.262 --> 03:51:17.744]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:17.744 --> 03:51:26.652]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:51:26.732 --> 03:51:27.052]  Yes.
[03:51:27.052 --> 03:51:28.894]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:51:28.894 --> 03:51:33.097]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:51:33.097 --> 03:51:38.120]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[03:51:38.120 --> 03:51:39.802]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[03:51:41.963 --> 03:51:43.044]  Keep it natural.
[03:51:43.044 --> 03:51:51.451]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[03:51:51.451 --> 03:51:56.675]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[03:51:56.675 --> 03:52:02.460]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:52:02.460 --> 03:52:07.704]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.477 --> 03:52:14.340]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.340 --> 03:52:20.843]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.843 --> 03:52:22.824]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.824 --> 03:52:25.286]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:25.286 --> 03:52:36.171]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.456 --> 03:52:40.136]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.136 --> 03:52:41.997]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.997 --> 03:52:48.899]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.899 --> 03:52:57.161]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.161 --> 03:52:58.722]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.722 --> 03:52:59.922]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.633 --> 03:53:05.034]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[03:53:05.034 --> 03:53:09.495]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[03:53:09.495 --> 03:53:11.996]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[03:53:11.996 --> 03:53:18.258]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[03:53:18.258 --> 03:53:24.640]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:28.083]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[03:53:28.083 --> 03:53:35.470]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, sea vegetables, and antioxidants.
[03:53:35.470 --> 03:53:37.633]  You know, you work hard for your money.

[03:53:40.215 --> 03:53:40.776]  Order today!
[03:53:41.456 --> 03:53:44.479]  Hey, 1-800-210-1922.

[03:54:05.052 --> 03:54:07.634]  Eastbound and down, loaded up and truckin'.
[03:54:07.634 --> 03:54:09.996]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[03:54:13.508 --> 03:54:14.969]  We got a long way to go.
[03:54:14.969 --> 03:54:17.571]  And a short time to get there.
[03:54:17.571 --> 03:54:23.334]  I was doing 130 on the way to work this morning.
[03:54:23.334 --> 03:54:27.997]  I'm just joking, I don't do that.
[03:54:27.997 --> 03:54:32.940]  Alright, I'm joking folks.
[03:54:45.047 --> 03:54:52.976]  We're going to do at least 20 minutes into the next hour.
[03:54:52.976 --> 03:54:54.298]  We're going to be opening the phones up.
[03:54:54.298 --> 03:54:56.200]  Everybody that's been holding, you can call 888-201-2244.
[03:54:56.200 --> 03:54:56.260]  888-201-2244.
[03:54:56.260 --> 03:54:56.300]  888-201-2244.
[03:55:07.507 --> 03:55:07.967]  888-201-2244.
[03:55:07.967 --> 03:55:12.010]  We'll go right to your calls when we start the next hour with Michael McNair.
[03:55:12.010 --> 03:55:20.315]  Again, Jason Burmiss reading over the 200-something pages of the Virginia Fusion Center document, which says, you are a terrorist if you believe in the Second Amendment.
[03:55:20.315 --> 03:55:23.437]  I mean, this thing is the worst thing I've ever read in my life.
[03:55:23.437 --> 03:55:25.259]  And we just got this an hour ago.
[03:55:25.259 --> 03:55:27.080]  We're feverishly trying to read over it right now.
[03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:28.321]  In fact, cut over to Burmy.
[03:55:28.321 --> 03:55:31.503]  He's, I mean, in a second, I just want to show, well, I guess you can't see the table.
[03:55:31.503 --> 03:55:32.703]  Show him on that camera.
[03:55:32.703 --> 03:55:34.404]  I mean, there's all the documents spread out.
[03:55:34.404 --> 03:55:34.925]  He's over there
[03:55:35.365 --> 03:55:38.577]  He's over there highlighting them, getting them all ready, down there on the table.
[03:55:38.577 --> 03:55:40.003]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[03:55:41.567 --> 03:55:43.609]  Before I end this hour, get the word out.
[03:55:43.609 --> 03:55:45.411]  These terrorists can't stop us.
[03:55:45.411 --> 03:55:47.993]  They carried out 9-11 and the banking collapsed.
[03:55:47.993 --> 03:55:49.454]  We expose what they're doing.
[03:55:49.454 --> 03:55:51.736]  And that's what the Obama Deception does.
[03:55:51.736 --> 03:55:52.737]  So get the DVD.
[03:55:52.737 --> 03:55:53.458]  We're now caught up.
[03:55:53.458 --> 03:55:55.980]  We're shipping like the day after we got the order out.
[03:55:55.980 --> 03:55:57.362]  We've got caught up on shipping.
[03:55:57.362 --> 03:56:00.244]  So get your orders in for the Obama Deception at InfoWars.com.
[03:56:00.244 --> 03:56:03.027]  And here's some of the other sponsors at the end of the main transmission.
[03:56:03.027 --> 03:56:03.647]  Then we're coming back.
[03:56:03.647 --> 03:56:04.768]  I want to thank them for helping us.
[03:56:05.549 --> 03:56:06.550]  Get everything done.

[03:56:37.969 --> 03:56:41.791]  The globalists want to shut things down, so you've got to come hat in hand to them.
[03:56:41.791 --> 03:56:44.352]  You'll never understand the bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:56:44.352 --> 03:56:47.834]  efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[03:56:47.834 --> 03:56:49.454]  Continuing here, Home Gain.
[03:56:49.454 --> 03:56:53.636]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, homegain.com.
[03:56:53.636 --> 03:56:56.678]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor,

[03:57:30.948 --> 03:57:31.508]  Very.
[03:57:31.508 --> 03:57:35.650]  Well, he's probably in the Fusion Report or something, because he knows how to read.
[03:57:35.650 --> 03:57:37.190]  We're doing how to read is wrong.
[03:57:37.190 --> 03:57:40.851]  Again, you will love the site, homegame.com.
[03:57:40.851 --> 03:57:50.295]  And last but not least of our sponsors, here at the end of the main transmission, we're going into overdrive, internetonly, infowars.com, audio streams, and prisonplanet.tv on the video.
[03:57:51.435 --> 03:57:58.183]  Jason Barbas has got Max Keiser on tonight, and I'm going to pop in in the last hour going after Glenn Beck at his latest Disinfo piece.
[03:57:58.183 --> 03:57:59.864]  After I do two hours with Raleigh James.
[03:57:59.864 --> 03:58:01.827]  Survivalistseeds.com.

[03:58:13.599 --> 03:58:21.123]  Uh, just, uh, there's a real heirloom seed shortage right now, so people interested in growing their own healthy food need to get the heirloom seeds now and start their gardens this spring.
[03:58:21.123 --> 03:58:22.663]  And freedom starts with action.
[03:58:22.663 --> 03:58:26.945]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is how you survive the world economic collapse.

[03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:41.052]  We're gonna be back live in 70 seconds, right here on The Infowar, with Burmess and Michael Bagnerik.
[03:58:41.052 --> 03:58:41.572]  Stay with us.
[03:58:43.331 --> 03:58:46.812]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.812 --> 03:58:49.593]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:49.593 --> 03:58:51.594]  Yeah, I'm starting my attack run now.
[03:58:51.594 --> 03:58:52.234]  Hello, friends.
[03:58:52.234 --> 03:58:53.295]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.295 --> 03:58:58.036]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.036 --> 03:59:00.998]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:00.998 --> 03:59:02.258]  You'll never have to stand in a bread
[03:59:02.338 --> 03:59:03.119]  We're good to go.
[03:59:23.619 --> 03:59:28.761]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:59:28.761 --> 03:59:35.023]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-scribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:59:35.023 --> 03:59:42.185]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:42.185 --> 03:59:46.386]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:59:46.386 --> 03:59:47.527]  Take action today.
[03:59:47.527 --> 03:59:49.848]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:59:49.848 --> 03:59:51.008]  Initiate Overdrive!
[04:00:14.688 --> 04:00:22.194]  Alright, we are locked and loaded.
[04:00:22.194 --> 04:00:23.755]  Jason Burnis.
[04:00:37.617 --> 04:00:41.141]  In the studio, we'll be live at 9, 9 to midnight out of the InfoWars Command Center.
[04:00:41.141 --> 04:00:42.823]  And make no mistake, it is the Command Center.
[04:00:44.514 --> 04:00:52.056]  I can't believe we're in this position, because I didn't ask for this job, and Lord knows I'm probably not up to it, but you know what?
[04:00:52.056 --> 04:00:57.317]  The job's got to be done, so we're trying to mobilize humanity literally against the eugenicist exterminators.
[04:00:57.317 --> 04:01:08.480]  And out there in the fight, a great captain in the defense of liberty resists the tyranny is Michael Bagner, a constitutional scholar, an amazing political mind, former presidential nominee.
[04:01:09.680 --> 04:01:17.224]  And candidate, the candidate 2004, with America's third largest party, the Libertarian Party, with us for another 20 minutes.
[04:01:17.224 --> 04:01:23.426]  Michael, I'm going to try to shut up here, because we've had a great banter back and forth for about five minutes, for you to go over where you see us going.
[04:01:23.426 --> 04:01:30.970]  If this is the time for the greatest effort in mobilization to warn people about the criminal hijacking of the nation, then we're going to get more into this unbelievable Virginia
[04:01:36.220 --> 04:01:44.943]  I think this is the time.
[04:01:44.943 --> 04:01:50.405]  This is the time that you and I and all of our other patriot leaders have been predicting.
[04:01:50.405 --> 04:01:54.867]  There's going to come a time when the people are going to have to stand up and defend their own right.
[04:01:54.867 --> 04:01:56.047]  And it's beginning.
[04:01:56.047 --> 04:01:56.647]  It is now.
[04:01:58.944 --> 04:02:04.068]  I recommend that people find out about the Tea Party.
[04:02:04.068 --> 04:02:12.514]  Nearest to them there's going to be 150, I've seen that number up to a thousand in different cities.
[04:02:12.514 --> 04:02:20.660]  And we use that, I'm sorry I always interrupt, we use that to go out and educate and quote radicalize the people that are there to the full spectrum.
[04:02:20.660 --> 04:02:20.960]  Go ahead.
[04:02:21.584 --> 04:02:28.010]  Yeah, so if you want to meet with other people that feel the same way you do, you're not in this alone.
[04:02:28.010 --> 04:02:30.292]  You are not doing this by yourself.
[04:02:30.292 --> 04:02:42.183]  Go out to a tea party rally, help out with the people there, network, get to know other people's phone numbers and email addresses, and do what you can in your area.
[04:02:42.851 --> 04:02:49.618]  I am now the coordinator, the Texas coordinator for Continental Congress 2009.
[04:02:49.618 --> 04:02:57.786]  The website is wethepeoplecongress.org.
[04:02:57.786 --> 04:03:00.909]  You can, there's a little tab there, you can select your state.
[04:03:01.722 --> 04:03:03.583]  And we are trying to organize.
[04:03:03.583 --> 04:03:05.803]  Everybody knows the government is out of control.
[04:03:05.803 --> 04:03:08.004]  The question is, what do we do about it?
[04:03:08.004 --> 04:03:20.607]  We want to nominate three delegates from each state, just like they did before the Declaration of Independence, and get 150 of the brightest political minds in the United States to decide where we go from here.
[04:03:21.247 --> 04:03:22.668]  So, we need your help.
[04:03:22.668 --> 04:03:27.929]  There's going to be a conference call next Tuesday at 7pm.
[04:03:27.929 --> 04:03:42.054]  Go to the website, it's got the conference call listed, and definitely attend one of the many, many, many Tea Party rallies that are being held next week on Wednesday the 15th of April.
[04:03:42.054 --> 04:03:43.374]  Well, well done my friend.
[04:03:43.374 --> 04:03:44.495]  We really commend you here.
[04:03:48.942 --> 04:03:49.825]  I totally agree with you.
[04:03:49.825 --> 04:03:51.892]  It's the over-the-top nature of all of this.
[04:03:51.892 --> 04:03:54.460]  I mean, it's just becoming too insane.
[04:03:55.921 --> 04:04:02.627]  And I just want to remind your listeners one more time, I've been teaching my Constitution class since 2001.
[04:04:02.627 --> 04:04:09.393]  I'll be in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 25th and 26th.
[04:04:09.393 --> 04:04:15.278]  A huge End the Fed rally on Saturday the 25th.
[04:04:15.278 --> 04:04:17.500]  They've invited me to be one of the speakers.
[04:04:17.500 --> 04:04:20.363]  I'll be teaching my Constitution class on Sunday.
[04:04:21.164 --> 04:04:25.127]  Um, right after the rally, and the day after the rally.
[04:04:25.127 --> 04:04:31.692]  And your listeners, anybody listening to Alex Jones right now, can go to my website, you get a $15 discount.
[04:04:31.692 --> 04:04:34.173]  It may not be much, but it's what I can do.
[04:04:34.173 --> 04:04:45.061]  And just click on the PayPal button on my homepage, constitutionpreservation.org, and there's a little tab there, they should put in, Long Live the Republic.
[04:04:45.061 --> 04:04:46.182]  Good, good, good.
[04:04:47.703 --> 04:04:48.344]  Yeah, I came from here.
[04:04:48.344 --> 04:04:53.410]  Alright, now I want to expand on something here.
[04:04:53.410 --> 04:04:56.874]  Just like they said, Al Qaeda is about to get us right before they stage the 9-11 attacks.
[04:04:58.612 --> 04:05:04.516]  And I said this months ago, I said they're saying that China and Russia are going to attack the web and shut the web down.
[04:05:04.516 --> 04:05:06.157]  Meanwhile, they've caught clearly U.S.
[04:05:06.157 --> 04:05:12.941]  submarines out cutting major cables to Europe and Asia and Russia and the Middle East.
[04:05:12.941 --> 04:05:14.482]  In the last year that's been happening.
[04:05:14.482 --> 04:05:17.284]  They've cut as many as four cables in one week.
[04:05:17.284 --> 04:05:19.265]  So all sorts of espionage.
[04:05:19.265 --> 04:05:22.928]  You've got Jay Rockefeller separately saying we'd be better off never having an internet.
[04:05:24.002 --> 04:05:30.848]  You've got Mother Jones admitting, and that's a liberal site, newspaper magazine, that Obama wants to take the web over.
[04:05:30.848 --> 04:05:34.131]  Their intelligence czar quit three weeks ago.
[04:05:34.131 --> 04:05:37.934]  The cyber security czar, who was an Obama guy, saying, this is fascism.
[04:05:37.934 --> 04:05:39.195]  You're taking the web over.
[04:05:39.195 --> 04:05:44.921]  The Pentagon is going to make all private internet businesses, whoever they want, down to a computer and a hard drive.
[04:05:45.481 --> 04:05:52.308]  Put in government snooping hubs where the government automatically has no Fourth or Fifth Amendment and reads everything.
[04:05:52.308 --> 04:05:54.531]  Even Keith Olbermann's now attacked Obama for this.
[04:05:54.531 --> 04:05:58.435]  I mean, because this is off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:05:58.435 --> 04:06:01.919]  And then, look, General warns of growing threat from cyber attacks.
[04:06:01.919 --> 04:06:03.580]  Cyber attacks pose an increasingly serious
[04:06:04.221 --> 04:06:05.221]  Costly threat to U.S.
[04:06:05.221 --> 04:06:07.122]  government and commercial networks that the U.S.
[04:06:07.122 --> 04:06:08.443]  General warned Tuesday.
[04:06:08.443 --> 04:06:14.145]  So their own guys quit saying it's a takeover, and they're saying, oh, we're about to be hit by Russia and China to shut the web down.
[04:06:14.145 --> 04:06:19.328]  Then they'll shut it off and make us go to Internet 2, which they admit is highly controlled, and no freedom.
[04:06:19.328 --> 04:06:28.332]  So along with the collapsing economy, along with the riots they want to stage, they don't want me being able to counter the New York Times when they say I'm calling for cop killing, when I'm saying the opposite.
[04:06:28.812 --> 04:06:37.025]  They want to carry out their crimes of lies against me and Bagnaric and the movement and everybody else should write stuff that Lou Dobbs is a terrorist, you know, in the...
[04:06:38.871 --> 04:06:42.854]  These are the guys that started the report saying I said kill the cops, basically.
[04:06:42.854 --> 04:06:45.316]  This is the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[04:06:45.316 --> 04:06:48.578]  This month's issue, by the way, I'm in there, along with Lou Dobbs.
[04:06:48.578 --> 04:06:51.900]  So, we have to understand something here.
[04:06:51.900 --> 04:06:53.281]  This is real.
[04:06:53.281 --> 04:06:57.144]  The people running things funded Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot.
[04:06:57.144 --> 04:07:00.287]  Did you guys ever pull up that article about German government says U.S.
[04:07:00.287 --> 04:07:02.668]  government funded Pol Pot?
[04:07:02.668 --> 04:07:03.489]  Did you ever find that?
[04:07:06.812 --> 04:07:09.974]  In Google News, try something like U.S.
[04:07:09.974 --> 04:07:11.595]  Pol Pot or U.S.
[04:07:11.595 --> 04:07:14.196]  Khmer Rouge and it'll come up.
[04:07:14.196 --> 04:07:18.839]  The issue here is these people don't care about us, do they, Michael Bagneri?
[04:07:18.839 --> 04:07:20.059]  No, absolutely not.
[04:07:20.059 --> 04:07:24.682]  We are useless eaters to them and they want to reduce our population.
[04:07:24.682 --> 04:07:30.305]  They want to eliminate anybody that disapproves of their actions.
[04:07:30.305 --> 04:07:32.326]  Anybody who is guilty of dissent.
[04:07:33.374 --> 04:07:39.457]  And George Bush did that after the tragedy in New York.
[04:07:39.457 --> 04:07:42.338]  He said, you're either with us or you're against us.
[04:07:42.338 --> 04:07:46.940]  And, you know, if they're going to be violating the Constitution, I'm against them.
[04:07:46.940 --> 04:07:55.423]  I'm going to do everything I can, as long as I am capable of taking a breath, to promote liberty and protect our Constitutional Republic.
[04:07:55.423 --> 04:07:57.104]  That's the legacy I hope to leave.
[04:08:04.366 --> 04:08:05.307]  We're good to go.
[04:08:16.656 --> 04:08:22.598]  And, uh, I mean, my whole point is Brzezinski brags about it, but, you know, it's like, oh, Alex talks about freedom.
[04:08:22.598 --> 04:08:24.439]  That made a guy shoot a cop.
[04:08:24.439 --> 04:08:25.699]  Totally made up.
[04:08:25.699 --> 04:08:29.460]  And then, oh, but Brzezinski brags he helped kill three million.
[04:08:29.460 --> 04:08:30.721]  Oh, how liberal!
[04:08:30.721 --> 04:08:32.441]  Oh, beautiful!
[04:08:32.441 --> 04:08:33.502]  Beautiful!
[04:08:33.502 --> 04:08:36.963]  I mean, isn't this sick?
[04:08:36.963 --> 04:08:39.344]  It is criminally insane.
[04:08:39.344 --> 04:08:41.885]  It is psychopathic.
[04:08:41.885 --> 04:08:45.966]  And, you know, there's no way to negotiate with a terrorist.
[04:08:46.556 --> 04:08:48.457]  I mean, we're going to have to stand up.
[04:08:48.457 --> 04:08:51.820]  And, you know, everybody wants change.
[04:08:51.820 --> 04:08:54.041]  Nobody wants it to be violent.
[04:08:54.041 --> 04:08:57.263]  And you and I don't want it to be violent, but we're going to need numbers.
[04:08:57.263 --> 04:09:00.406]  We're going to need millions of people to stand up.
[04:09:00.406 --> 04:09:06.710]  And like they stood up for the Ron Paul campaign, they are standing up for these tea parties.
[04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:14.015]  Apparently this was started by one blogger who was going to happen in Seattle, and it has just spread like wildfire.
[04:09:14.355 --> 04:09:17.477]  Only 9-11 Truth's been having tea parties, and yeah, that kind of spurred it.
[04:09:17.477 --> 04:09:28.784]  And this is how the idea of liberation and revolution against tyranny begins, is that, for those that don't understand, people kept saying, oh, Ron Paul didn't win, all that money, all that was a loss.
[04:09:28.784 --> 04:09:34.987]  No, it educated people about the bankers, about the inflation tax, about the New World Order, about the globalists.
[04:09:34.987 --> 04:09:40.671]  It's now the number one thing, not communism or fascism, you know, not liberalism or conservatism, on the campuses.
[04:09:41.611 --> 04:10:02.591]  And out of that now is spinning off all these other groups like Oath Keepers and everything else and it just builds and builds and it's organic and it's decentralized and it can't be stopped and it's just growing and now Nexus Pointing and they're all interconnecting and it's just powering up like a huge warehouse of dynamos.
[04:10:04.733 --> 04:10:05.334]  I think so.
[04:10:23.712 --> 04:10:25.313]  This is not the old Soviet Union.
[04:10:25.313 --> 04:10:27.634]  They're not going to get away with killing 50 million of us.
[04:10:27.634 --> 04:10:31.375]  We are not the disarmed Cambodians, poor people.
[04:10:31.375 --> 04:10:37.878]  And look folks, when they try their crap, it is going to end in the security forces being absolutely decimated.
[04:10:37.878 --> 04:10:39.199]  We don't want that to happen.
[04:10:39.879 --> 04:10:46.606]  I mean, I'm old enough, I have a family, I have children, I'm not 18 anymore where you have that wild-eyed thing of violence being a good idea.
[04:10:46.606 --> 04:10:49.189]  That's why they want you when you're young and dumb.
[04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:50.210]  I don't want the violence.
[04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:51.751]  I don't want it to be 1776.
[04:10:51.751 --> 04:10:53.293]  I don't want it to go to that.
[04:10:53.293 --> 04:10:59.479]  But sure, as the sun came up this morning, the globalists are pushing into that and they know it's going to happen.
[04:10:59.479 --> 04:11:01.981]  And it's going to chew up the military and police like you've never seen.
[04:11:02.842 --> 04:11:07.404]  Because there's millions of people that just aren't putting up with the crap anymore.
[04:11:07.404 --> 04:11:11.446]  And, hey, don't get mad at me that I warned you when you're putting your foot in the bear trap.
[04:11:11.446 --> 04:11:17.850]  I'm telling you now, and in your gut, you know I'm telling you the truth, police and military, so I'm going to tell you right now.
[04:11:17.850 --> 04:11:19.230]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[04:11:19.230 --> 04:11:31.457]  You are controlled by very evil people who are marching you right into a giant column of the American people that aren't under my control, and this is not going to be like the killing fields that the globalists
[04:11:33.015 --> 04:11:41.637]  Yeah, I agree.
[04:11:41.637 --> 04:11:50.659]  People are waking up, and it is this information war, an ideological war, and our numbers are growing.
[04:11:50.659 --> 04:11:53.900]  The pendulum is swinging in the other direction very rapidly.
[04:11:55.932 --> 04:12:00.493]  The bad news is some people have taken this long to figure things out.
[04:12:00.493 --> 04:12:07.455]  The good news is the people who are just jumping on board now are really, really passionate.
[04:12:07.455 --> 04:12:09.896]  Just like that guy that called me and said, we've got to do something.
[04:12:09.896 --> 04:12:11.736]  We've got to do something now.
[04:12:11.736 --> 04:12:15.217]  So these people are looking for a direction.
[04:12:16.058 --> 04:12:18.300]  And we have built the infrastructure.
[04:12:18.300 --> 04:12:25.269]  We've been telling them, get involved, participate in these tea parties.
[04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:28.033]  Go to my website and get a copy of my book.
[04:12:28.033 --> 04:12:32.819]  In fact, chapter two of my book is available for free.
[04:12:32.819 --> 04:12:33.580]  The idea of
[04:12:34.498 --> 04:12:35.199]  I think.
[04:12:50.402 --> 04:12:51.883]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[04:12:51.883 --> 04:12:58.268]  I want to go to phone calls, but Burma's, for an hour plus, has been reading the new Fusion Center report out of Virginia.
[04:12:58.268 --> 04:12:59.329]  These are secret.
[04:12:59.329 --> 04:13:00.110]  This is secret.
[04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:02.171]  Remember, we broke the MIAC and people didn't believe it.
[04:13:02.171 --> 04:13:03.252]  This is far worse.
[04:13:03.252 --> 04:13:04.273]  You can call the phone numbers.
[04:13:04.273 --> 04:13:06.114]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[04:13:06.114 --> 04:13:08.056]  Nemo's going to do a more detailed report on it.
[04:13:08.056 --> 04:13:11.518]  Got a big Chemtel report coming out at PrisonPlanet.com in the next little while.
[04:13:11.518 --> 04:13:15.021]  Let's get the home gang guerrilla out of here.
[04:13:15.021 --> 04:13:15.741]  This is ridiculous.
[04:13:17.003 --> 04:13:18.143]  Okay, go ahead.
[04:13:18.143 --> 04:13:19.004]  Sure, Alex.
[04:13:19.004 --> 04:13:29.307]  Well, just going through this, this harkens back to the first time that I saw 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and you literally in that film said, we are the terrorists, everything is terrorism.
[04:13:29.307 --> 04:13:31.568]  And I didn't believe that, Alex, but right here.
[04:13:31.568 --> 04:13:32.568]  But I was showing you the training
[04:13:32.648 --> 04:13:34.209]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[04:13:34.209 --> 04:13:38.192]  I mean, I remember going back and trying to, uh, you know, source everything, and I could.
[04:13:38.192 --> 04:13:41.135]  And I still couldn't believe, you know, this was the real deal.
[04:13:41.135 --> 04:13:43.116]  But in this one, there is no doubt.
[04:13:43.116 --> 04:13:45.939]  You know, you just talked about cybercrime and cyberterrorism.
[04:13:45.939 --> 04:13:49.421]  Well, here's that subsection, and, uh... Everything's terror!
[04:13:49.421 --> 04:13:51.763]  Yes, now, this is, uh, now terrorism.
[04:13:51.763 --> 04:13:59.129]  The non-violent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends is now terrorism.
[04:13:59.129 --> 04:13:59.930]  So it can be legal.
[04:14:00.560 --> 04:14:01.941]  But it's terrible.
[04:14:01.941 --> 04:14:02.902]  I hope you're listening.
[04:14:02.902 --> 04:14:03.402]  Bullet points.
[04:14:03.402 --> 04:14:05.604]  We need a massive story.
[04:14:05.604 --> 04:14:20.957]  Remember when they introduced a bill the Feds wrote in 2003 in Oregon that said downloading music terrorism, life in prison and a forced labor camp in a forest labor camp was the quote.
[04:14:20.957 --> 04:14:24.000]  And remember what PC World reported
[04:14:25.350 --> 04:14:29.873]  Obama is signing a secret treaty to ban all peer-to-peer anyways.
[04:14:29.873 --> 04:14:30.433]  Yeah.
[04:14:30.433 --> 04:14:31.454]  So, keep going.
[04:14:31.454 --> 04:14:33.075]  Yeah, I mean, alright, let's keep going.
[04:14:33.075 --> 04:14:38.858]  These tools include website defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft.
[04:14:38.858 --> 04:14:40.899]  Here's the one that's just unbelievable right here.
[04:14:40.899 --> 04:14:42.340]  Website parodies.
[04:14:42.340 --> 04:14:45.181]  Apparently, we can't parody things with websites.
[04:14:45.181 --> 04:14:46.462]  It's unbelievable.
[04:14:46.462 --> 04:14:50.685]  Virtual sit-ins, virtual sabotage, and software development.
[04:14:50.685 --> 04:14:54.467]  Software development, Alex, is now cyberterrorism.
[04:14:54.887 --> 04:14:57.169]  I mean, how off the charts is that?
[04:14:57.169 --> 04:14:58.571]  For any political purpose.
[04:14:58.571 --> 04:15:02.135]  And this is law enforcement sensitive, just like the MIAC report.
[04:15:02.135 --> 04:15:07.380]  Because they want to do this lying and cheating and slandering and defaming in the dark.
[04:15:07.380 --> 04:15:08.401]  Okay, go to the next section.
[04:15:08.401 --> 04:15:09.382]  There's too many.
[04:15:09.382 --> 04:15:10.783]  Tell folks that section that want to know.
[04:15:10.783 --> 04:15:11.684]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[04:15:11.684 --> 04:15:14.888]  Yeah, that is page 81, and this is the cyber terrorism section.
[04:15:14.888 --> 04:15:15.909]  Okay, continue, continue.
[04:15:15.909 --> 04:15:16.309]  Yes, sir.
[04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:17.050]  Here, right here.
[04:15:18.231 --> 04:15:20.352]  He is the lone wolf extremist.
[04:15:20.352 --> 04:15:25.395]  Now, if you are included in social, political, or religious causes... I haven't read that yet.
[04:15:25.395 --> 04:15:26.035]  It says you have.
[04:15:26.035 --> 04:15:29.957]  I've seen it before by other feds putting it out.
[04:15:29.957 --> 04:15:33.038]  Locking your desk, not talking, being pro-Second Amendment terrorist.
[04:15:33.038 --> 04:15:35.219]  Yeah, I mean it's un-bomb-believable.
[04:15:35.219 --> 04:15:36.660]  Does it say locking your desk?
[04:15:36.660 --> 04:15:38.481]  I'm not sure if that's in here.
[04:15:38.481 --> 04:15:43.844]  They always also say mainline groups that have soup kitchens and say sheriffs have authority.
[04:15:43.844 --> 04:15:44.684]  They say that's terrorism.
[04:15:44.864 --> 04:15:47.926]  Yeah, they're going hardcore after anti-abortion groups.
[04:15:47.926 --> 04:15:55.369]  I mean, they're listing colleges like James Madison University as a possible place to harbor terrorism.
[04:15:55.369 --> 04:15:56.250]  What's another?
[04:15:56.250 --> 04:15:57.610]  University College of William and Mary.
[04:15:57.610 --> 04:16:04.874]  So now, if you're a Christian and you don't believe in abortion, if you're part of Life and Liberty Ministries, you may be a terrorist.
[04:16:05.034 --> 04:16:08.335]  Well, see, what's happening is now 70 plus percent of people are against abortion.
[04:16:08.335 --> 04:16:09.635]  We're winning that fight, too.
[04:16:09.635 --> 04:16:14.996]  They're fighting out of zona blava tissue, because all the vans driving around showing a baby at a month old being chopped up.
[04:16:14.996 --> 04:16:17.457]  So, see, okay, please continue with how we're all terrorists.
[04:16:17.457 --> 04:16:19.097]  Yes, I mean, let's just go through it.
[04:16:19.097 --> 04:16:25.098]  I mean, if you're trying to recruit people for your cause, you're radicalizing them, therefore it's terrorism.
[04:16:25.098 --> 04:16:25.779]  Where is that?
[04:16:25.779 --> 04:16:26.659]  What section is that?
[04:16:26.659 --> 04:16:28.779]  That is recruitment and radicalization.
[04:16:28.779 --> 04:16:29.339]  That is page 125.
[04:16:29.339 --> 04:16:31.660]  Let's see if I even have that in front of me.
[04:16:32.440 --> 04:16:36.384]  Again, this is a 215-page document, folks, and I'm just one person.
[04:16:36.384 --> 04:16:37.305]  Continue, continue.
[04:16:37.305 --> 04:16:38.686]  Yeah, let's go to that.
[04:16:38.686 --> 04:16:39.447]  I think I have that one.
[04:16:39.447 --> 04:16:40.207]  What is that one?
[04:16:40.207 --> 04:16:42.469]  Go over to the other areas you have lit up there.
[04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:43.870]  Sure, sure.
[04:16:43.870 --> 04:16:45.332]  Let's see.
[04:16:45.332 --> 04:16:46.233]  This is just the beginning.
[04:16:46.233 --> 04:16:48.995]  Listen, you've got to do Control-F searches for, like, Ron Paul.
[04:16:48.995 --> 04:16:49.756]  I did.
[04:16:49.756 --> 04:16:50.837]  Ron Paul's not in there.
[04:16:50.837 --> 04:16:51.998]  Libertarian's not in there.
[04:16:51.998 --> 04:16:53.379]  Infowars is not in there.
[04:16:53.379 --> 04:16:56.381]  I did the Control-F searches, so I was kind of just going through each spot.
[04:16:57.382 --> 04:16:59.784]  I didn't do Second Amendment, so I'm not quite sure.
[04:16:59.784 --> 04:17:01.485]  I do have to do a control F search.
[04:17:01.485 --> 04:17:03.687]  I mean, this was really off the cuff, Alex.
[04:17:03.687 --> 04:17:07.829]  I mean, people who are starting anti-Obama websites are apparently terrorists.
[04:17:07.829 --> 04:17:08.270]  Oh!
[04:17:08.270 --> 04:17:09.711]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:17:09.711 --> 04:17:10.011]  Read that!
[04:17:10.011 --> 04:17:11.332]  What page is that on?
[04:17:11.332 --> 04:17:13.433]  That is page 60.
[04:17:13.433 --> 04:17:21.979]  Apparently, one of the militia groups out there, Virginia militia groups, the group appears to have been started as a direct result of the founders' frustration with the Obama administration.
[04:17:22.059 --> 04:17:24.241]  And I mean, notice they're spying on all these groups.
[04:17:24.241 --> 04:17:27.664]  Yeah, no, every single one of these, they talk about how they have surveillance at the end.
[04:17:27.664 --> 04:17:35.332]  You see, this is going county by county, in subsections, literally saying where these groups are, who they are, and how they... That's the issue!
[04:17:35.332 --> 04:17:37.154]  This is a surveillance document!
[04:17:37.154 --> 04:17:39.216]  Oh my God, this is... just like when they got caught...
[04:17:39.676 --> 04:17:42.417]  Well, apparently we don't have freedom of speech in this country anymore.
[04:17:42.417 --> 04:17:44.597]  During the presidential campaign, I spoke at a college.
[04:18:03.815 --> 04:18:05.917]  In a auditorium.
[04:18:05.917 --> 04:18:11.841]  And they wouldn't move to a smaller room because it was a free speech zone.
[04:18:11.841 --> 04:18:16.825]  And I told that audience that anywhere I happen to be standing is a free speech zone.
[04:18:17.772 --> 04:18:26.778]  And, you know, we, the purpose, when I teach my class, the purpose of freedom of speech is freedom of political speech.
[04:18:26.778 --> 04:18:33.743]  If we have the right to alter... Now that is the most protected speech there is, but now, now, now we don't even have free speech zones.
[04:18:33.743 --> 04:18:34.684]  Now we just got rid of it.
[04:18:34.684 --> 04:18:38.786]  They turn it right into a privilege, then they sequester it, then they get rid of it.
[04:18:38.786 --> 04:18:39.687]  Unbelievable.
[04:18:39.687 --> 04:18:41.168]  Burmas, continue, then I want to go through some calls.
[04:18:41.548 --> 04:18:45.291]  Sure, here's just another subsection, uh, terrorist extremist group presence.
[04:18:45.291 --> 04:18:53.478]  It is important to note that university-based students groups are recognized as a radicalization node for almost every type of extremist group.
[04:18:53.478 --> 04:18:56.241]  You're in college, you're an extremist, you're a terrorist.
[04:18:56.241 --> 04:18:57.842]  A radicalization node?
[04:18:57.842 --> 04:19:02.366]  Yes, if you go to college, Alex, apparently you might be involved in extremism and terrorism.
[04:19:02.626 --> 04:19:03.687]  Can you hear me okay?
[04:19:22.850 --> 04:19:51.447]  Yeah, um, no, Alex, I'm a great fan of the show, and I think you do great work and everything, and I'm trying to wake people up, and, you know, I recommend the websites, and you, and I often have to defend you, and I'm saying stuff, and I say, you know, this, and they'll say, oh, he's crazy, or that, or whatever, and, like, all day today, you've been saying that that AP article about Obama looks at climate engineering,
[04:19:52.563 --> 04:20:02.400]  You've been saying that it says in that article that they're spraying chemtrails and Obama said it and the AP saying it in that article and they're not!
[04:20:05.836 --> 04:20:12.500]  They're saying they're thinking, they're saying that they're thinking about it, and it's something that they're considering.
[04:20:12.500 --> 04:20:15.362]  And, you know, I know they're doing chemistry.
[04:20:15.362 --> 04:20:17.223]  Well, let me answer this guy's question for a second, Alex.
[04:20:17.223 --> 04:20:19.544]  You know, one of the stories I went over yesterday is U.S.
[04:20:19.544 --> 04:20:21.125]  to take up carbon mantle.
[04:20:21.125 --> 04:20:25.227]  See, they're going to lead the way into this new green economy.
[04:20:25.227 --> 04:20:26.028]  Well, here's the deal.
[04:20:26.028 --> 04:20:29.670]  Even Saudi Arabia now, you know, Lindsey Williams has said this is going to kill Saudi Arabia.
[04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:31.171]  The Saudi Arabians are pissed.
[04:20:31.171 --> 04:20:34.333]  They're actually coming out saying this whole thing is going to ruin them.
[04:20:34.753 --> 04:20:38.534]  So if you're talking, if it says terraforming in that article, I have not seen it.
[04:20:38.534 --> 04:20:40.355]  Folks, they've been doing this openly.
[04:20:40.355 --> 04:20:44.556]  We're going to have Rosalind Peterson on both of our shows very shortly to go over the chemtrail.
[04:20:44.556 --> 04:20:45.196]  Hey, do me a favor.
[04:20:45.196 --> 04:20:47.337]  Will you guys print me that article again?
[04:20:47.337 --> 04:20:50.838]  Somebody picked it up or something because it's not here in my stack.
[04:20:50.838 --> 04:20:55.660]  The article about, no, it's not in that stack because that's yesterday's stack.
[04:20:56.824 --> 04:20:58.044]  Okay, somebody had it out of here.
[04:20:58.044 --> 04:20:59.025]  Okay, thank you.
[04:20:59.025 --> 04:20:59.805]  Okay, look.
[04:20:59.805 --> 04:21:00.905]  AP.
[04:21:00.905 --> 04:21:15.010]  Now, the reason I flipped out when I saw this on air is because I know about his science advisor and I know about the three articles Paul Watson wrote last year where they admitted it and then to have Obama come out and say we're looking at it
[04:21:15.470 --> 04:21:20.135]  My whole point is they admit that they have this terraforming and they say they've been testing it.
[04:21:20.135 --> 04:21:23.960]  So I have the complete knowledge of this information.
[04:21:23.960 --> 04:21:27.924]  I wouldn't say the complete, but for what's public, I have the complete knowledge of it.
[04:21:27.924 --> 04:21:33.491]  And so have you read the other three articles where they admit that they're altering the atmosphere?
[04:21:35.014 --> 04:21:41.082]  Yeah, and I totally know... Listen, screw your friends then, man.
[04:21:41.082 --> 04:21:41.823]  No, no, no, no.
[04:21:41.823 --> 04:21:44.867]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[04:21:44.867 --> 04:21:45.728]  Is he still there?
[04:21:45.728 --> 04:21:46.309]  I'm so mad.
[04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.870]  Go ahead and finish.
[04:21:48.510 --> 04:22:04.610]  No, I'm just saying can you see my point that it's hard that if I say people will go to that article and say Alex Jones said it said in this article they're doing that and they'll go it doesn't say that and he's full of crap!
[04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:05.010]  Screw him!
[04:22:05.010 --> 04:22:05.631]  Screw him!
[04:22:05.631 --> 04:22:06.092]  Screw him!
[04:22:07.333 --> 04:22:09.814]  I mean, you know, this is what it comes down to.
[04:22:09.814 --> 04:22:13.836]  All this nitpicking and all of this bull, man.
[04:22:13.836 --> 04:22:14.977]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[04:22:14.977 --> 04:22:15.557]  Listen, fine.
[04:22:15.557 --> 04:22:17.498]  Hey, let them have what they want then.
[04:22:17.498 --> 04:22:20.319]  $12.8 trillion's already been stolen.
[04:22:20.319 --> 04:22:24.001]  I get emails saying that's made up when it's in Bloomberg and Associated Press.
[04:22:24.001 --> 04:22:26.362]  Okay, I didn't make any of this stuff up.
[04:22:26.362 --> 04:22:31.924]  That is a legalese mind game that is being played, and frankly, I can't take it anymore.
[04:22:34.818 --> 04:22:36.599]  See, I'm sitting here... No, no, no.
[04:22:36.599 --> 04:22:37.679]  Appreciate your call.
[04:22:37.679 --> 04:22:38.500]  Let him go.
[04:22:38.500 --> 04:22:40.141]  I'm done talking to him.
[04:22:40.141 --> 04:22:41.121]  Sir, let me tell you something.
[04:22:41.121 --> 04:22:42.842]  Don't tell people to tune in to the show.
[04:22:42.842 --> 04:22:44.943]  I got a plan for you, okay?
[04:22:44.943 --> 04:22:46.004]  I got a plan.
[04:22:46.004 --> 04:22:48.245]  I got a plan and I want you to go by it, please.
[04:22:48.245 --> 04:22:49.445]  Don't ever listen again.
[04:22:49.445 --> 04:22:51.506]  I don't care, okay?
[04:22:51.506 --> 04:22:54.368]  I didn't lie about this.
[04:22:54.368 --> 04:22:57.569]  What I didn't do was play their propaganda game.
[04:22:57.569 --> 04:23:02.592]  Yes, Obama is openly announcing they may need to spray the atmosphere to save us.
[04:23:04.505 --> 04:23:09.609]  Now, I already knew a hundred universities have put out literally thousands of tests.
[04:23:09.609 --> 04:23:14.714]  It's hundreds of universities, Department of Energy, all these other foreign government departments.
[04:23:14.714 --> 04:23:17.136]  Jones, I gotta interrupt you.
[04:23:17.136 --> 04:23:18.017]  Turn his mic on.
[04:23:18.017 --> 04:23:18.537]  You know what?
[04:23:18.537 --> 04:23:19.618]  No, no, no, no.
[04:23:19.618 --> 04:23:21.019]  And I know Bagner is there and he's gotta go.
[04:23:21.019 --> 04:23:21.340]  We can go.
[04:23:21.340 --> 04:23:22.301]  If not, we're gonna take more calls.
[04:23:22.301 --> 04:23:23.762]  But, I mean, here's the issue.
[04:23:25.259 --> 04:23:28.581]  I sit there and I go, here's the CFR calling for global government.
[04:23:28.581 --> 04:23:31.904]  And then I get emails going, no, it says they're calling for global governance.
[04:23:31.904 --> 04:23:39.929]  Pull up, go to dictionary.com, just type the definition of governance.
[04:23:39.929 --> 04:23:42.511]  And it will say a system of government.
[04:23:42.511 --> 04:23:45.252]  So global government means a system of global government.
[04:23:45.252 --> 04:23:47.954]  And then I get these emails saying, no, it says governance, not government.
[04:23:47.954 --> 04:23:51.036]  I'm not playing your semantical games, man.
[04:23:51.036 --> 04:23:53.538]  I am not playing it.
[04:23:55.788 --> 04:23:57.069]  Okay?
[04:23:57.069 --> 04:24:00.250]  I'm not playing it.
[04:24:00.250 --> 04:24:03.332]  I am not going to sit there and just say definition of governance.
[04:24:03.332 --> 04:24:04.012]  That's Wikipedia.
[04:24:04.012 --> 04:24:05.013]  I want the encyclopedia one.
[04:24:05.013 --> 04:24:07.054]  That's similar, but I want it.
[04:24:07.054 --> 04:24:09.595]  I am not going to play these games anymore with folks.
[04:24:09.595 --> 04:24:10.716]  Okay?
[04:24:10.716 --> 04:24:14.337]  You know, we have posted the articles that no one seems to want to look at.
[04:24:14.337 --> 04:24:21.641]  They just want to speculate all day where they admit they're doing tests to terraform and manipulate the atmosphere.
[04:24:21.641 --> 04:24:23.662]  Okay?
[04:24:23.662 --> 04:24:25.063]  We have done the studies.
[04:24:26.345 --> 04:24:30.187]  They're saying, and they're doing it in a massive program.
[04:24:30.187 --> 04:24:31.167]  What's the definition of government?
[04:24:31.167 --> 04:24:34.889]  The act or process of power?
[04:24:34.889 --> 04:24:36.190]  Let me read it over here, it's so small on the screen.
[04:24:36.190 --> 04:24:38.991]  The act of the process of power or governing?
[04:24:38.991 --> 04:24:39.832]  Government.
[04:24:39.832 --> 04:24:40.812]  There you go!
[04:24:40.812 --> 04:24:43.674]  Okay, so see, every time I say that, I get nitpicks.
[04:24:43.674 --> 04:24:45.755]  And see, that's their little joke nitpicking.
[04:24:45.755 --> 04:24:50.697]  It says, international institutions and global governance program, world order in 21st century.
[04:24:52.577 --> 04:24:54.520]  And I get emails going, Alex, you lied.
[04:24:54.520 --> 04:24:56.502]  I can't put people on your side.
[04:24:56.502 --> 04:24:59.186]  They didn't call for global government, Alex.
[04:24:59.186 --> 04:25:00.468]  They called for global governance.
[04:25:03.843 --> 04:25:05.464]  I just, it doesn't compute.
[04:25:05.464 --> 04:25:07.825]  I can't play the game anymore.
[04:25:07.825 --> 04:25:11.766]  The point is they admit they're doing tests on manipulating the atmosphere everywhere.
[04:25:11.766 --> 04:25:15.848]  They put out government textbooks saying they're spraying the skies for our safety.
[04:25:15.848 --> 04:25:19.029]  You can Google that and pull up the textbooks for little kids.
[04:25:19.029 --> 04:25:20.370]  You can read it.
[04:25:20.370 --> 04:25:21.931]  And so here is Obama.
[04:25:21.931 --> 04:25:23.631]  That's what I said.
[04:25:23.631 --> 04:25:26.132]  That's what I said earlier.
[04:25:26.132 --> 04:25:29.074]  In fact, that's what I said earlier!
[04:25:29.074 --> 04:25:31.014]  That's what I said earlier!
[04:25:31.014 --> 04:25:32.035]  That's what I said!
[04:25:33.493 --> 04:25:35.354]  I feel like Howard Hughes saying, bring in the milk here.
[04:25:35.354 --> 04:25:37.435]  I mean, I'm just repeating it to these people.
[04:25:37.435 --> 04:25:53.401]  Going back a few hours ago when they walked in and handed it to me, I said, just like they've been spying for at least three decades without warrants on your phone calls, your faxes, and now, in later time, your emails and the rest of it, in the last 15 years, that now they want a bill to legalize it retroactively.
[04:25:53.401 --> 04:25:57.843]  Like they have a bill to turn the old military bases into FEMA camps after they already did it.
[04:25:59.329 --> 04:26:04.231]  So I made the point, I said, oh, here they are saying they want to do it after they're already doing it.
[04:26:04.231 --> 04:26:04.992]  I said that!
[04:26:04.992 --> 04:26:06.092]  Didn't I say that?
[04:26:06.092 --> 04:26:07.173]  Didn't I say that?
[04:26:07.173 --> 04:26:08.233]  Didn't I say that?
[04:26:08.233 --> 04:26:09.854]  DIDN'T I SAY THAT?!
[04:26:09.854 --> 04:26:11.795]  That chemtrails are real!
[04:26:11.795 --> 04:26:14.697]  I don't have time to play games with you anymore!
[04:26:14.697 --> 04:26:28.384]  If your jackass friends are this cowardly and this weak, and they don't know the government's coming after our guns, they've stolen $12.8 trillion, everything's going bankrupt, they're building FEMA camps, I can't help your friends!
[04:26:29.564 --> 04:26:34.686]  Who are just completely into living in denial and not seeing what's in front of their face.
[04:26:34.686 --> 04:26:37.047]  I apologize for getting so mad.
[04:26:37.047 --> 04:26:43.429]  I've been on air too long, but Michael Bagnerich, in closing, you want to make any comments on what I was just saying?
[04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:50.471]  The same way in my Constitution class and the people who realize it are getting fired up too.
[04:26:50.471 --> 04:26:54.473]  We are going to restore our Constitutional Republic and
[04:26:55.325 --> 04:27:05.627]  You know, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to benefit from all of our activity, and they will still be denying it, saying, well, you know, there was never any problem.
[04:27:05.627 --> 04:27:07.807]  That's not our problem.
[04:27:07.807 --> 04:27:11.368]  I try not to get upset at the people who don't understand.
[04:27:11.368 --> 04:27:20.509]  I just take advantage of the people who do, are willing to understand, that want the information, because we can do a lot more good there.
[04:27:20.509 --> 04:27:23.210]  We're not going to have everybody agree with us.
[04:27:23.940 --> 04:27:30.462]  And the good news, like I said, we had a huge rally for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.
[04:27:30.462 --> 04:27:36.803]  We've got huge rallies all over for Texas Tea Parties, the anti-tax Tea Parties.
[04:27:36.803 --> 04:27:43.064]  And another indication is that everybody seems to want to take my class on the Constitution.
[04:27:43.064 --> 04:27:44.465]  Well, that's exciting.
[04:27:44.465 --> 04:27:47.745]  Michael Magnarik, folks can find more about that at your website.
[04:27:47.745 --> 04:27:49.646]  Thank you for spending time with us and I'll talk to you soon.
[04:27:50.390 --> 04:27:50.910]  Thanks, Alex.
[04:28:09.144 --> 04:28:11.586]  You know, of course they introduce it in a way that sounds good.
[04:28:11.586 --> 04:28:32.542]  It's like HR 1444 and 1388 set up a national system to study and administer compulsory service, and then I've got the books, the documents, what they've been setting up, so I add my knowledge, and then I go, it'll be 18 to 24 for this, and a military brigade, it'll be an environmental brigade, it'll be everything I said in film six, seven years ago, because the feds were setting it up then.
[04:28:33.243 --> 04:28:36.146]  You know, I don't just read the AP article with their crap.
[04:28:36.146 --> 04:28:38.188]  I then add everything I know.
[04:28:38.188 --> 04:28:39.890]  See, but it's all this two-dimensional thinking.
[04:28:39.890 --> 04:28:41.891]  It's like Glenn Beck says, this is a fake FEMA camp.
[04:28:41.891 --> 04:28:43.333]  I can even predict what he's going to do.
[04:28:43.333 --> 04:28:46.376]  Instead of, oh, but look at all these other real camps.
[04:28:46.376 --> 04:28:49.058]  You see, it's the same thing with
[04:28:50.405 --> 04:28:55.869]  All of these issues, I already knew that they had NASA and the federal government admit they were spraying.
[04:28:55.869 --> 04:28:59.991]  They've been, and I've called Paul and Nemo, and I've said, we've got to write more articles about this.
[04:28:59.991 --> 04:29:00.992]  You've got to get more writers.
[04:29:00.992 --> 04:29:02.313]  We're writing two or three a day.
[04:29:02.313 --> 04:29:04.034]  Doing a great job.
[04:29:04.034 --> 04:29:05.795]  Well, how do you find writers that understand this stuff?
[04:29:05.795 --> 04:29:07.096]  There's not that many.
[04:29:07.096 --> 04:29:11.799]  I guess people could give us examples, and we can, you know, at Infowars.com, email us.
[04:29:11.799 --> 04:29:15.342]  I don't have enough money to hire too many more, pay a little bit or something.
[04:29:15.342 --> 04:29:19.044]  The point is, is that, because our articles tie everything together.
[04:29:19.044 --> 04:29:19.745]  You know, we'll show
[04:29:20.705 --> 04:29:26.687]  You know, like, they can go out to one funeral place and say, oh no, we're just expanding for dying veterans here with these new graves.
[04:29:26.687 --> 04:29:29.828]  We just so happen to put four person per grave right by each other.
[04:29:29.828 --> 04:29:30.748]  It's a new system.
[04:29:30.748 --> 04:29:31.649]  Maybe that's true.
[04:29:31.649 --> 04:29:36.650]  But then we have New York State documents you can call where they're saying, we're getting ready for mass flu pandemics.
[04:29:36.650 --> 04:29:38.451]  We need you to get ready with all these mass graves.
[04:29:38.451 --> 04:29:40.371]  And then I have the Rocky Mountain News saying it.
[04:29:40.371 --> 04:29:42.852]  We're getting ready with incinerators and mass graves.
[04:29:42.852 --> 04:29:44.453]  And I give you the address.
[04:29:44.453 --> 04:29:46.453]  And so, you know, it's this nitpicking.
[04:29:46.453 --> 04:29:48.034]  It's the same thing with this Obama thing.
[04:29:48.394 --> 04:29:51.676]  I said, oh my God, here they are saying they may have to do this to save us.
[04:29:51.676 --> 04:29:58.879]  They always introduce it that way, so this is an admission that they're terraforming, that that exists, that that's going on.
[04:29:58.879 --> 04:30:03.181]  And then you go to the university documents we posted a link to, they admit they're doing it.
[04:30:03.181 --> 04:30:06.522]  So my point is, to have them admit it in the AP was a big deal.
[04:30:06.522 --> 04:30:08.623]  And to have Obama's guy doing it.
[04:30:08.623 --> 04:30:13.826]  And when his head guy, his key science advisor says something, that's with certification.
[04:30:14.830 --> 04:30:27.293]  So yes, the Obama administration is admitting they're doing this, and you can nitpick and say, I mean, why aren't you talking about the fact that they're talking about terraforming and saying we may have to do this, and that I've proven from their own documents they already are?
[04:30:27.293 --> 04:30:29.633]  Why isn't it about what the hell are they doing?
[04:30:29.633 --> 04:30:32.254]  Why is it all about, well, gee, I don't know?
[04:30:32.254 --> 04:30:36.195]  You know, it's kind of like, I told people how they introduced FEMA camps.
[04:30:36.195 --> 04:30:37.675]  I said, they are going to come out.
[04:30:39.239 --> 04:30:43.124]  And they are going to say, oh, it's for the homeless.
[04:30:43.124 --> 04:30:45.186]  Oh, you can't be homeless anymore.
[04:30:45.186 --> 04:30:46.027]  And there's crimes.
[04:30:46.027 --> 04:30:47.428]  We've got to search you and disarm you.
[04:30:47.428 --> 04:30:49.530]  And we're going to have a brig on there.
[04:30:49.530 --> 04:30:52.193]  But don't worry, there's going to be a medical center.
[04:30:52.193 --> 04:30:53.415]  I said that for years.
[04:30:53.415 --> 04:30:54.456]  How have they now announced it?
[04:30:56.089 --> 04:30:58.190]  I mean, I said exactly how Glenn Beck would do it.
[04:30:58.190 --> 04:30:59.430]  I understand this.
[04:30:59.430 --> 04:31:03.412]  Folks, I haven't taken calls all day, hardly, because I don't want to stop.
[04:31:03.412 --> 04:31:04.512]  Because I'm passionate.
[04:31:04.512 --> 04:31:05.972]  Most hosts lean on the callers.
[04:31:05.972 --> 04:31:07.233]  They lean on guests.
[04:31:07.233 --> 04:31:08.993]  They don't want to be on air.
[04:31:08.993 --> 04:31:11.314]  They want to be out playing golf or chasing tail.
[04:31:11.314 --> 04:31:12.094]  I want to be here.
[04:31:12.094 --> 04:31:13.055]  This is what I do.
[04:31:13.055 --> 04:31:13.675]  I study them.
[04:31:13.675 --> 04:31:14.175]  I know them.
[04:31:14.175 --> 04:31:15.176]  I know the enemy.
[04:31:15.176 --> 04:31:16.116]  I understand what they're doing.
[04:31:16.116 --> 04:31:17.636]  They're going to kill our asses.
[04:31:17.636 --> 04:31:19.037]  These people mean business!
[04:31:20.868 --> 04:31:22.613]  These people mean business, man!
[04:31:22.613 --> 04:31:24.478]  My whole life's on the line with this!
[04:31:24.478 --> 04:31:26.584]  And you call into the show nitpicking!
[04:31:30.236 --> 04:31:32.959]  I mean, what I did in the interest of time was I condensed it all together.
[04:31:32.959 --> 04:31:35.962]  I said, yes, now they're introducing how we need it.
[04:31:35.962 --> 04:31:36.983]  That's how they always do it.
[04:31:36.983 --> 04:31:39.325]  After they've already been doing it, we have the articles.
[04:31:39.325 --> 04:31:42.888]  Here's the name of the articles up on PrisonPlanet.com where they admit they're doing.
[04:31:42.888 --> 04:31:47.212]  So I made that all perfectly clear without adding a bunch of tremulous hesitation.
[04:31:47.212 --> 04:31:50.396]  I mean, I don't know who we need.
[04:31:51.317 --> 04:31:57.526]  I mean, like you said, seven years ago, I make a film, Road to Tyranny, showing you the documents where they say we're all terrorists, and now it's all big news everywhere.
[04:31:57.526 --> 04:32:04.396]  I broke the MIAC report, and I had my own people going, I don't see Ron Paul there, and he's not in there, and I'm like, he's on page eight!
[04:32:04.396 --> 04:32:05.377]  He's on page eight!
[04:32:06.818 --> 04:32:09.560]  I can't handle this stuff, man!
[04:32:09.560 --> 04:32:10.640]  I know how this works!
[04:32:10.640 --> 04:32:12.401]  This is what I do!
[04:32:12.401 --> 04:32:14.042]  I've interviewed thousands of experts!
[04:32:14.042 --> 04:32:15.643]  I do this stuff 18 hours a day!
[04:32:15.643 --> 04:32:18.585]  I don't have time for your crap anymore!
[04:32:18.585 --> 04:32:19.125]  And you know what?
[04:32:19.125 --> 04:32:20.106]  You can do a better job.
[04:32:20.106 --> 04:32:21.666]  Get your own radio show.
[04:32:21.666 --> 04:32:22.747]  Get it there in Florida.
[04:32:22.747 --> 04:32:23.687]  Go out and do it.
[04:32:23.687 --> 04:32:26.749]  Man, I didn't claim to have all the answers!
[04:32:26.749 --> 04:32:31.612]  But see, instead it's going to be about, oh, Obama just says they may terraform.
[04:32:31.612 --> 04:32:33.653]  I told you they admit they're already doing it.
[04:32:33.653 --> 04:32:34.373]  My God.
[04:32:37.168 --> 04:32:41.458]  I guess everything's okay, Bernus, because, yeah, the camps are real, but, you know, they're only for our safety.
[04:32:41.458 --> 04:32:42.560]  Well, I don't think everything's okay.
[04:32:42.560 --> 04:32:43.923]  I mean, who are these timid people?
[04:32:44.807 --> 04:32:51.728]  Well, then, Alex, I'm listening right now, and he said they're doing it, but Obama just says they may have to.
[04:32:51.728 --> 04:32:52.488]  Let's be honest.
[04:32:52.488 --> 04:32:54.449]  The point is they're saying it's real!
[04:32:54.449 --> 04:33:01.210]  The point is they're saying they can manipulate the atmosphere, spraying aerosols, that they're doing right now!
[04:33:01.210 --> 04:33:04.350]  The point is they admit the frickin' thing's real!
[04:33:04.350 --> 04:33:12.372]  God, you people have been conditioned from birth to not have any connection to reality, to not see right through things, to not go with it!
[04:33:13.294 --> 04:33:17.439]  I mean, how is it bizarre for me to say they're admitting they have chemtrails, is my point?
[04:33:17.439 --> 04:33:19.222]  They're admitting they have chemtrails!
[04:33:19.222 --> 04:33:21.024]  They're admitting they have chemtrails!
[04:33:21.024 --> 04:33:22.706]  They're admitting they have chemtrails!
[04:33:23.868 --> 04:33:26.008]  THEY'RE SPRAYING US IN A SECRET PROGRAM!
[04:33:26.008 --> 04:33:27.009]  GOD!
[04:33:27.009 --> 04:33:28.989]  I'm sorry, go ahead Burmus, give us the latest info.
[04:33:28.989 --> 04:33:32.110]  Yeah, you know, um, I got the second half of the document right here.
[04:33:32.110 --> 04:33:33.970]  Here's page 120.
[04:33:33.970 --> 04:33:36.831]  It's all about internet and how we're bad, we're terrorists, Alex.
[04:33:36.831 --> 04:33:45.192]  Internet technology has emerged as the preferred medium for extremist communication and is increasingly being exploited to assist terrorists in achieving their goals.
[04:33:45.192 --> 04:33:48.473]  It's used to recruit and radicalize, uh, supportive terrorist activities.
[04:33:48.473 --> 04:33:51.834]  See, that's how they say terrorist and then radical and then extremist and they can call me an extremist.
[04:33:51.834 --> 04:33:53.234]  It's all about murder and
[04:33:53.534 --> 04:33:54.295]  And how dare they?
[04:33:54.295 --> 04:34:02.501]  These groups solicit funds on their websites through donations as well as the sales of various items including publications, audio and visual media.
[04:34:02.501 --> 04:34:03.722]  Here's where it gets great!
[04:34:03.722 --> 04:34:12.729]  Extremist groups also actively use web forums, blogs, social networking sites such as YouTube, MySpace, Google Video, and of course, Twitter.
[04:34:13.649 --> 04:34:14.850]  Oh my God!
[04:34:14.850 --> 04:34:16.472]  And then, here's even better.
[04:34:16.472 --> 04:34:24.642]  On the bottom, they say Twitter was used as a counter-surveillance command and control and the movement of tool by activists at the Republican National Convention.
[04:34:24.642 --> 04:34:26.724]  You know where this article comes out of?
[04:34:26.724 --> 04:34:27.585]  Sample.
[04:34:27.585 --> 04:34:30.909]  Al-Qaeda-like mobile discussions and potential creative uses.
[04:34:31.129 --> 04:34:36.831]  So if you're protesting the Republican National Party... It's Al-Qaeda-like!
[04:34:36.831 --> 04:34:38.952]  And they'll also go, well, it just mixes them in.
[04:34:38.952 --> 04:34:40.453]  They're not saying they're Al-Qaeda.
[04:34:40.453 --> 04:34:42.053]  They just say it's Al-Qaeda-like.
[04:34:42.053 --> 04:34:45.134]  I mean, you said they were equating protesters with Al-Qaeda.
[04:34:45.134 --> 04:34:46.675]  They just said Al-Qaeda-like.
[04:34:46.675 --> 04:34:49.476]  I don't think that really means they're equating them with them.
[04:34:49.476 --> 04:34:51.897]  I don't think the government's really bad.
[04:34:51.897 --> 04:34:52.998]  I don't believe it.
[04:34:52.998 --> 04:34:54.058]  I don't know.
[04:34:54.338 --> 04:34:55.319]  Yeah.
[04:34:55.319 --> 04:34:58.441]  Like you said, the general populace is so ignorant and mesmerized.
[04:34:58.441 --> 04:34:59.823]  Let me give you an example.
[04:34:59.823 --> 04:35:06.828]  One of my really good friends back in New York, he does a financial blog for one of the bigger, you know, I'm not going to say the company, but he does a big financial blog.
[04:35:06.828 --> 04:35:07.569]  I'm not kidding.
[04:35:07.569 --> 04:35:08.330]  We're so free.
[04:35:08.330 --> 04:35:10.832]  So I said to him, well, what do you think about this new global currency?
[04:35:11.232 --> 04:35:12.392]  He's like, what are you talking about?
[04:35:12.392 --> 04:35:15.974]  And I sent him the article out of the Telegraph with the IMF talking about it.
[04:35:15.974 --> 04:35:20.315]  But let me guess, he had been preconditioned it didn't exist, so he couldn't see the article?
[04:35:20.315 --> 04:35:22.276]  No, he figured it out, kind of.
[04:35:22.276 --> 04:35:22.656]  Kind of.
[04:35:22.656 --> 04:35:24.837]  Like, he looked at it, he said, well, where is this global currency?
[04:35:24.837 --> 04:35:28.298]  And I said, look, this is called... It's monetized at the top, he couldn't understand that.
[04:35:28.298 --> 04:35:29.098]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:35:29.098 --> 04:35:29.538]  Exactly.
[04:35:29.538 --> 04:35:36.161]  And then I explained to him, hey, look what just went down at the G20 with Gordon Brown, not only calling for this new global deal, but a new world order.
[04:35:36.161 --> 04:35:39.122]  And then I showed him the clip of Hannity and Dick Morris actually confirming it.
[04:35:39.462 --> 04:35:39.602]  Yeah.
[04:35:39.602 --> 04:35:40.002]  I lost him there.
[04:35:40.002 --> 04:35:43.004]  That's about the point where I lost him, where he just could not wrap his mind around it.
[04:36:10.430 --> 04:36:15.277]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry, 200 million wasn't half the plan.
[04:36:15.277 --> 04:36:16.198]  I'm disgusted, Alex.
[04:36:16.198 --> 04:36:18.701]  I mean, I've got another hundred pages to go through on this thing.
[04:36:18.701 --> 04:36:19.242]  Hey, you know what?
[04:36:19.242 --> 04:36:20.223]  That doesn't exist.
[04:36:20.223 --> 04:36:21.585]  That paper doesn't exist.
[04:36:21.585 --> 04:36:22.346]  I want you to prove.
[04:36:23.368 --> 04:36:25.150]  No, Alex made up the MIAC.
[04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:28.174]  You know, for the people at PrisonPlanet.TV, look at this document.
[04:36:28.174 --> 04:36:29.696]  Look what I am holding in my hands.
[04:36:29.696 --> 04:36:32.941]  This is, I mean, this is unbelievable!
[04:36:32.941 --> 04:36:34.423]  Well, that's an internal one, is why.
[04:36:34.423 --> 04:36:34.983]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:36:34.983 --> 04:36:37.126]  That's why it says they're surveilling all those people.
[04:36:37.126 --> 04:36:38.969]  The key is, all those people are being surveilled.
[04:36:38.969 --> 04:36:40.030]  I'd love to get the Texas one.
[04:36:41.151 --> 04:36:44.614]  I've been sent the short Texas ones and posted them, but I haven't gotten... Well, you called it, Alex.
[04:36:44.614 --> 04:36:46.215]  You said these were going out all over the country.
[04:36:46.215 --> 04:36:47.596]  They obviously are going out all over the country.
[04:36:47.596 --> 04:36:48.016]  Well, I know they are.
[04:36:48.016 --> 04:36:48.756]  It's all federally written.
[04:36:48.756 --> 04:36:49.377]  They admit that.
[04:36:49.377 --> 04:36:49.937]  Yes.
[04:36:49.937 --> 04:36:50.277]  Yes.
[04:36:50.277 --> 04:36:51.799]  So, you know... I didn't call it.
[04:36:51.799 --> 04:36:53.980]  They admit that these reports are federally written.
[04:36:53.980 --> 04:36:57.622]  Well, I just commend you... I don't see proof!
[04:36:57.622 --> 04:36:58.703]  I don't see proof!
[04:36:58.703 --> 04:37:00.264]  Okay, go Google the articles.
[04:37:00.264 --> 04:37:03.626]  You got the governor saying the feds wrote this and the Kansas City Star.
[04:37:03.626 --> 04:37:07.029]  It's not my job to sit there and hand-feed you everything, okay?
[04:37:09.137 --> 04:37:10.879]  I'm with you Alex, I'm just trying to do the right thing.
[04:37:10.879 --> 04:37:15.644]  If you put this out there to people, and you know, if people can do a better job, please help us.
[04:37:15.644 --> 04:37:18.287]  This isn't, you know, we got, we got the government.
[04:37:18.287 --> 04:37:21.190]  I am sick and tired of people calling me, telling me what I need to do.
[04:37:21.190 --> 04:37:26.756]  Well you, Alex, especially being here, you know, seeing how much you work, I mean you are a work horse.
[04:37:26.756 --> 04:37:28.898]  I couldn't work as much as this guy, I'll tell you that right now.
[04:37:28.898 --> 04:37:30.039]  I need to quit.
[04:37:30.039 --> 04:37:30.980]  No, you don't need to quit.
[04:37:31.661 --> 04:37:33.022]  You Alex, you really are.
[04:37:33.022 --> 04:37:35.063]  I mean, now it's gotten to the point where I know it's life and death.
[04:37:35.063 --> 04:37:36.423]  I mean, you can't get out of this.
[04:37:36.423 --> 04:37:39.105]  There's only one way to make it out of here, and that's going through these sons of bitches.
[04:37:39.105 --> 04:37:39.685]  Well, you know what?
[04:37:39.685 --> 04:37:41.646]  I want to tell people when they... I mean, let me tell you something, folks.
[04:37:41.646 --> 04:37:47.248]  They plan to take you in the final equation after a bunch of stage crises and getting you used to riots and problems down the road.
[04:37:47.248 --> 04:37:49.369]  They plan to blow your frickin' head off, okay?
[04:37:49.369 --> 04:37:52.011]  And you know, you can suck your thumb all day and say, I'm making that up.
[04:37:52.011 --> 04:37:53.631]  Hey, fine, more power to you.
[04:37:53.631 --> 04:37:58.634]  But at least when it gets worse and worse and I get proven right on the rest of the stuff, get up off your fat asses.
[04:37:59.494 --> 04:38:02.537]  Get up off your big, fat, and you can be skinny.
[04:38:02.537 --> 04:38:03.998]  I'm not bashing fat people.
[04:38:03.998 --> 04:38:04.959]  I'm a little chubby.
[04:38:04.959 --> 04:38:06.660]  The point is, I mean, your soul's fat.
[04:38:06.660 --> 04:38:09.422]  You're slovenly and you're weak.
[04:38:09.422 --> 04:38:10.023]  Okay?
[04:38:10.023 --> 04:38:16.648]  I mean, if you can't see what's going on, you've got a big problem.
[04:38:16.648 --> 04:38:17.529]  Just wait.
[04:38:17.529 --> 04:38:18.370]  Just go ahead.
[04:38:18.370 --> 04:38:18.930]  Go ahead, Burmess.
[04:38:18.930 --> 04:38:19.531]  I want to take calls.
[04:38:19.531 --> 04:38:19.771]  Go ahead.
[04:38:20.345 --> 04:38:21.905]  Alright, you know, I... So you got more there?
[04:38:21.905 --> 04:38:23.906]  I mean, yeah, you can go through this whole thing.
[04:38:23.906 --> 04:38:29.507]  I mean, everything is considered terrorism and... Look, your whole first hour, I know you got Kaiser on second hour?
[04:38:29.507 --> 04:38:30.547]  I got Kaiser on the second hour.
[04:38:30.547 --> 04:38:33.428]  I'm going to be going over this... You need to cover that, the whole first hour at 9 o'clock tonight.
[04:38:33.428 --> 04:38:37.249]  Yeah, the whole first hour is going to be... And you got Kaiser on, and then I'll call in with the Beck thing after that.
[04:38:37.249 --> 04:38:38.369]  We got a big show tonight, Alex.
[04:38:38.369 --> 04:38:44.490]  I got attacked for saying he was a government agent, and he was going to stab us in the back, and then now it was proven right, exactly as I said.
[04:38:44.490 --> 04:38:46.390]  I mean, do you people have any respect for me?
[04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:48.271]  Do you have any respect for me?
[04:38:49.031 --> 04:38:52.975]  Or is it just, oh, we don't believe Alex?
[04:38:52.975 --> 04:38:56.159]  Well, you know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, but that's all they're good at.
[04:38:56.159 --> 04:38:59.242]  No, that guy sounded apologetic and nice, and that's why it made me so mad.
[04:38:59.242 --> 04:39:02.385]  He's like, I'm sorry, but I can't pour people at your show, and you're blah blah blah.
[04:39:02.385 --> 04:39:05.829]  I said, hey, this article right here, and by the way, they admit it.
[04:39:05.829 --> 04:39:07.470]  The point is, they're admitting the chemtrails.
[04:39:08.331 --> 04:39:09.312]  Okay, that's my point.
[04:39:09.312 --> 04:39:13.695]  Instead of like inventing that I'm like, it's just so nitpicky, man.
[04:39:13.695 --> 04:39:15.996]  It's just, it drives me insane.
[04:39:15.996 --> 04:39:18.678]  The point is they're spraying us, okay?
[04:39:18.678 --> 04:39:20.939]  And they're admitting that they're doing it.
[04:39:20.939 --> 04:39:24.481]  And he goes, no, they're saying they're looking at it.
[04:39:24.481 --> 04:39:26.623]  The point is they're admitting it's real and rolling it out.
[04:39:26.623 --> 04:39:28.064]  The issue is that they're rolling it out.
[04:39:30.771 --> 04:39:31.332]  My God.
[04:39:31.332 --> 04:39:36.296]  And they're not going to have arguments all day with people about their, you know, well there is a law I gotta take vaccines.
[04:39:36.296 --> 04:39:41.100]  And I gotta explain to them that there's... Oh, right there it says, you know, terrorists won't take shots.
[04:39:41.100 --> 04:39:44.062]  You know what, as soon as you said it I was just pulling out a random page.
[04:39:44.062 --> 04:39:44.803]  You can't handle it anymore.
[04:39:44.803 --> 04:39:47.145]  It's public health and health care part of the terrorism.
[04:39:47.645 --> 04:39:48.766]  So what do the terrorists believe in?
[04:39:48.766 --> 04:39:49.526]  Well, let's see.
[04:39:49.526 --> 04:39:50.887]  Sector list criteria.
[04:39:50.887 --> 04:39:57.650]  Primary HHS-owned or managed pharmaceutical and medical equipment stockpile sites centered for disease control.
[04:39:57.650 --> 04:39:59.071]  This is forced inoculation, Craig.
[04:39:59.071 --> 04:39:59.311]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:39:59.311 --> 04:40:01.432]  It looks like that's exactly what this is.
[04:40:01.432 --> 04:40:02.633]  Oh, my God.
[04:40:02.633 --> 04:40:04.093]  I mean, I've got to sit down with this guy.
[04:40:04.093 --> 04:40:09.436]  I mean, folks, it's not easy going through this with their doublespeak, too, because everything is good for you.
[04:40:09.436 --> 04:40:10.116]  It doesn't exist.
[04:40:10.116 --> 04:40:11.917]  Everybody knows I made up the MIAC report.
[04:40:11.917 --> 04:40:12.978]  I'm still being accused of that.
[04:40:13.678 --> 04:40:14.439]  And that was a big thing.
[04:40:14.439 --> 04:40:17.201]  A lot of people really said that that was a totally fair support.
[04:40:17.201 --> 04:40:19.583]  It's all still there.
[04:40:19.583 --> 04:40:21.645]  No, I made it up, they say.
[04:40:21.645 --> 04:40:22.947]  Again, I covered this on my show.
[04:40:22.947 --> 04:40:23.507]  I had someone call me.
[04:40:23.507 --> 04:40:23.827]  Doesn't matter.
[04:40:23.827 --> 04:40:25.669]  The head of the MIAC thing just resigned.
[04:40:25.669 --> 04:40:27.471]  Yeah, that's right.
[04:40:27.471 --> 04:40:28.632]  Doesn't exist.
[04:40:28.632 --> 04:40:29.212]  Doesn't exist.
[04:40:29.212 --> 04:40:33.776]  Doesn't matter that I get calls that people are getting pulled over in Los Angeles County for having Ron Paul 08 bumper stickers.
[04:40:33.776 --> 04:40:35.238]  No, there's video of it in Las Vegas.
[04:40:36.755 --> 04:40:38.076]  You know, we're all just terrorists, Alex.
[04:40:38.076 --> 04:40:39.276]  We should just give in and bow down.
[04:40:39.276 --> 04:40:41.517]  But, you know... But I mean, look, look, look.
[04:40:41.517 --> 04:40:43.698]  Let's say 90% of what I'm saying is accurate.
[04:40:43.698 --> 04:40:45.279]  And really, it's like 110.
[04:40:45.279 --> 04:40:46.940]  It's worse than what I'm saying.
[04:40:46.940 --> 04:40:51.762]  You know, um... It's worse than what I'm saying.
[04:40:51.762 --> 04:40:54.724]  And... But let's just say 10% was true.
[04:40:54.724 --> 04:40:55.444]  Hypothetically.
[04:40:55.444 --> 04:40:56.705]  I mean, is that not bad?
[04:40:56.705 --> 04:41:01.227]  I mean, were we not screwed with that?
[04:41:01.227 --> 04:41:02.188]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:41:02.188 --> 04:41:04.689]  I mean, the government's admitting, for your safety, we're gonna chemtrail you.
[04:41:05.848 --> 04:41:06.889]  Oh, Jesus.
[04:41:06.889 --> 04:41:07.790]  That's what this means.
[04:41:07.790 --> 04:41:09.091]  See, I know their language.
[04:41:09.091 --> 04:41:18.178]  When they say, oh, we're looking at spraying the atmosphere with particulates to save you, I know they've already admitted it in a bunch of government documents, so the point is they're rolling it out is the big issue.
[04:41:18.178 --> 04:41:20.139]  And so I tell you what the meaning of it is.
[04:41:20.139 --> 04:41:21.040]  It's like a translator.
[04:41:22.355 --> 04:41:29.797]  The President's new science advisor said Wednesday that global warming is so dire that the Obama Administration is discussing radical technologies to cool Earth's air.
[04:41:29.797 --> 04:41:37.779]  John Holdren told the Associated Press in his interview since the first interview being confirmed last month that the idea of geoengineering the climate is being discussed.
[04:41:37.779 --> 04:41:41.240]  See, chemtrails are so big in his first interview, this is what he says.
[04:41:41.240 --> 04:41:43.140]  But see, being discussed, they're testing it.
[04:41:43.140 --> 04:41:44.761]  When you go read the science, it's all testing.
[04:41:44.761 --> 04:41:46.001]  This is all just testing.
[04:41:46.877 --> 04:41:47.477]  Just like U.S.
[04:41:47.477 --> 04:41:59.701]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Section 1,528, Paragraph B says, oh, well, we can use chemical, biological, or radiologicals on you without your consent unless it's part of law enforcement or testing.
[04:41:59.701 --> 04:42:00.862]  Then we don't have to tell you.
[04:42:00.862 --> 04:42:06.684]  And then there's big law firms reporting on them that it says that, and people say, oh, it doesn't really, you're reading that wrong.
[04:42:06.684 --> 04:42:13.286]  Okay, whatever, Mac.
[04:42:13.286 --> 04:42:13.866]  Good God.
[04:42:16.072 --> 04:42:18.274]  Tinker with climate is just his personal view.
[04:42:18.274 --> 04:42:24.361]  However, he went on to say that he raised it in administration discussions.
[04:42:24.361 --> 04:42:27.324]  He's far from alone in talking geoengineering.
[04:42:27.324 --> 04:42:33.851]  The National Academy of Science is making climate tinkering the subject of its first workshop in the multi-discipline climate challenges program.
[04:42:33.851 --> 04:42:35.893]  The British Parliament has also discussed the idea.
[04:42:35.893 --> 04:42:37.855]  See, they're now rolling it out to you folks.
[04:42:38.851 --> 04:42:51.718]  The American Meteorological Society is crafting a policy statement on geoengineering that says it is prudent to consider geoengineering potential to understand its limits and to avoid rash deployment.
[04:42:51.718 --> 04:42:54.199]  So the point is they're introducing this to the slaves.
[04:42:54.199 --> 04:42:58.461]  And then I went on to say that we have articles where they're admitting it.
[04:42:58.461 --> 04:42:59.002]  You can go read them.
[04:42:59.002 --> 04:43:00.262]  In fact, let me see if Watson has them.
[04:43:00.262 --> 04:43:01.603]  Okay, I promise to go to your calls.
[04:43:01.603 --> 04:43:03.064]  I'm just out of control.
[04:43:03.064 --> 04:43:04.545]  Linda in California, you're on the air.
[04:43:04.545 --> 04:43:05.085]  Thanks for holding.
[04:43:07.062 --> 04:43:07.362]  Hi.
[04:43:07.362 --> 04:43:07.963]  Hi.
[04:43:07.963 --> 04:43:10.064]  How are you doing, Alex?
[04:43:10.064 --> 04:43:11.986]  Sorry I had to hear that rant, Linda.
[04:43:11.986 --> 04:43:13.147]  Oh no, you know what?
[04:43:13.147 --> 04:43:16.370]  I'm your male counterpart.
[04:43:16.370 --> 04:43:24.756]  I get really frustrated at people that attack you without first doing their homework and checking the information.
[04:43:24.756 --> 04:43:33.003]  You know, I have the computer up and I'm listening to your show either on the phone or I'm listening online and then I'll go and do what you say to do, trust.
[04:43:33.564 --> 04:43:34.525]  But verify.
[04:43:34.525 --> 04:43:36.746]  Look at the information.
[04:43:36.746 --> 04:43:37.366]  Google.
[04:43:37.366 --> 04:43:44.730]  You know, we have access to more information now with the Internet, and people are more lazy.
[04:43:44.730 --> 04:43:45.410]  It's the same thing.
[04:43:45.410 --> 04:43:53.935]  And let me ask you, because I really respect you and what you do, your perspective from a believer in Jesus, that they just want to stand down.
[04:43:53.935 --> 04:43:54.515]  And I said,
[04:43:55.279 --> 04:43:57.340]  Have you studied what the Word says?
[04:43:57.340 --> 04:44:12.226]  You can fully line up where we are right now in the Bible, and that it says that, and I had called Jason the other night, that kingdom versus kingdom, we've had nations against nations, we're kingdom of light versus kingdom of darkness.
[04:44:12.226 --> 04:44:16.788]  We have an obligation to lay down our life for the brethren, and it doesn't mean just
[04:44:17.268 --> 04:44:19.170]  Stand in a firing squad.
[04:44:19.170 --> 04:44:23.633]  Lay down your life, not caring what other people think, but getting the truth to them.
[04:44:23.633 --> 04:44:27.657]  I'll roll down my window at an intersection and go, have you heard of the New World Order?
[04:44:27.657 --> 04:44:28.878]  Go to InfraWars.
[04:44:28.878 --> 04:44:30.099]  I pass out flyers.
[04:44:30.099 --> 04:44:31.960]  I call the government.
[04:44:31.960 --> 04:44:34.062]  I do email campaigns.
[04:44:34.062 --> 04:44:42.369]  We have an obligation to tell them that judgment, the sword is coming in the book of Ezekiel.
[04:44:43.917 --> 04:44:46.439]  We don't warn the people.
[04:44:46.439 --> 04:44:47.900]  Their blood's on our hands.
[04:44:47.900 --> 04:44:56.927]  We have a duty to our nation, to our world, as you stand for humanity.
[04:44:56.927 --> 04:45:00.070]  Well, not just as Christians standing for Jesus.
[04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:05.754]  We need to stand for humanity in general and lay down our life and not care what people think.
[04:45:05.754 --> 04:45:10.038]  He who endures to the end shall be saved.
[04:45:10.038 --> 04:45:12.660]  Linda, I totally hear you and I agree with you.
[04:45:13.520 --> 04:45:29.048]  And, you know, all the disciples being killed or put in prison, Jesus being killed for not doing what government said, the prophets being killed, it, you know, not doing what the king says, being put in the fiery furnace of the lion's den, Moses not doing what Pharaoh said.
[04:45:29.048 --> 04:45:36.332]  But according to them, no, Romans 13, Moses should have knelt down, you know, before the Pharaoh, Ramses, and should have licked his boots.
[04:45:37.113 --> 04:45:52.898]  You know, because, and that's why the government finances Romans 13, so whether it's the end of the world or not, we have a duty, and if people really had Christ in their heart, if they really had Yahweh in their heart, they would be uncontrollably fighting the New World Order, who's running child kidnapping rings and everything else.
[04:45:52.898 --> 04:45:58.240]  I mean, I just rage against them wanting to fight them and stop them, and I can't control myself wanting to resist them.
[04:45:58.880 --> 04:46:01.883]  And then people are like, oh, praise God, it's almost the end.
[04:46:01.883 --> 04:46:04.045]  I'll be teleported out of here soon.
[04:46:04.045 --> 04:46:04.806]  What a cop-out.
[04:46:04.806 --> 04:46:06.808]  Good to hear from you, Linda.
[04:46:06.808 --> 04:46:08.709]  Leanne in Georgia, you're on the air.
[04:46:08.709 --> 04:46:10.391]  Go ahead, Leanne.
[04:46:10.391 --> 04:46:11.632]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[04:46:11.632 --> 04:46:16.857]  I have a question, a little bit of information, and a request of you.
[04:46:16.857 --> 04:46:24.184]  First off, have you ever read or are you familiar with a book called The Red Amendment by L.B.
[04:46:24.184 --> 04:46:24.504]  Bush?
[04:46:27.902 --> 04:46:29.523]  Alright.
[04:46:29.523 --> 04:46:35.384]  If I may, I'd like to read just a little bit of a paragraph from the preface.
[04:46:35.384 --> 04:46:42.907]  It says that you will find that you have not been living under the true Constitution that was established by the Founding Fathers.
[04:46:42.907 --> 04:46:48.949]  You will find that you have been removed from your lawful country under the semblance of law.
[04:46:48.949 --> 04:46:53.230]  Hence, you will find you are not living in a free state as you have been told.
[04:46:53.905 --> 04:46:58.328]  You will find out that you are living under dictatorial rule.
[04:46:58.328 --> 04:47:03.352]  All these facts will be clearly demonstrated with legal reference and so on.
[04:47:03.352 --> 04:47:06.494]  My request, would you please have L.B.
[04:47:06.494 --> 04:47:09.817]  Bork on your show?
[04:47:09.817 --> 04:47:14.500]  And you can find him at pacinlaw.org.
[04:47:14.500 --> 04:47:18.503]  PAC is P-A-C, stands for People's Awareness Coalition.
[04:47:19.349 --> 04:47:23.931]  So that would be T-A-C-I-N-L-A-W dot org.
[04:47:23.931 --> 04:47:24.951]  Alright, we'll do this.
[04:47:24.951 --> 04:47:25.672]  Send me the info.
[04:47:25.672 --> 04:47:26.452]  I need to look over it.
[04:47:26.452 --> 04:47:29.213]  I'm not saying this person's a legal quack.
[04:47:29.213 --> 04:47:30.974]  I'm not familiar with them.
[04:47:30.974 --> 04:47:33.595]  And I have to specifically look at what they're talking about myself.
[04:47:33.595 --> 04:47:36.716]  But I mean, you seem to think it's pretty convincing.
[04:47:36.716 --> 04:47:38.257]  What is he specifically talking about?
[04:47:38.257 --> 04:47:41.518]  How we're under the corporate district of Columbia?
[04:47:41.518 --> 04:47:42.879]  And after the Civil War?
[04:47:42.879 --> 04:47:44.579]  Or what is he claiming?
[04:47:44.579 --> 04:47:47.100]  He goes into all of it.
[04:47:49.531 --> 04:47:52.633]  It's a treaty.
[04:47:52.633 --> 04:48:01.217]  What he says is that... You're talking about the treaty included in the late 1790s between the United States and the Queen?
[04:48:01.217 --> 04:48:02.458]  Or the King?
[04:48:02.458 --> 04:48:04.019]  It has regard to the 14th Amendment.
[04:48:07.261 --> 04:48:08.702]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[04:48:08.702 --> 04:48:09.443]  That's what I figured.
[04:48:09.443 --> 04:48:11.084]  Well, that's got a lot of truth to it.
[04:48:11.084 --> 04:48:17.509]  I mean, they did conclude treaties of truce with the Queen and the King after the war.
[04:48:17.509 --> 04:48:19.010]  People misconstrued that as a sell-out.
[04:48:19.010 --> 04:48:19.971]  It really wasn't.
[04:48:19.971 --> 04:48:23.113]  But certainly, yeah, what happened after the Civil War is real.
[04:48:23.113 --> 04:48:23.874]  We'll look into that.
[04:48:23.874 --> 04:48:25.075]  Thanks for holding to bring that up.
[04:48:25.075 --> 04:48:26.456]  I need to get to everybody else here.
[04:48:26.456 --> 04:48:27.417]  Robert in Texas.
[04:48:27.417 --> 04:48:28.278]  Robert, you're on the air.
[04:48:28.278 --> 04:48:31.180]  Hi, Alex.
[04:48:31.180 --> 04:48:32.020]  Hi.
[04:48:32.020 --> 04:48:32.941]  You hear me?
[04:48:32.941 --> 04:48:33.602]  Yes, sir, I do.
[04:48:34.565 --> 04:48:35.906]  Okay, cool.
[04:48:35.906 --> 04:48:41.449]  Well, first off, I want to say that me and my beautiful girlfriend, Sarah, are huge fans of your show.
[04:48:41.449 --> 04:48:45.872]  We just got done watching your Bohemian Grove film.
[04:48:45.872 --> 04:48:46.972]  It creeped her out a lot.
[04:48:46.972 --> 04:48:49.754]  It creeped me out a lot, too.
[04:48:49.754 --> 04:48:51.855]  Anyway, let me get to my point.
[04:48:51.855 --> 04:48:56.818]  First, I have a question, and then I have a little bit of information I wanted to share with you.
[04:48:56.818 --> 04:48:57.739]  The question was,
[04:49:01.141 --> 04:49:07.446]  My girlfriend and I have noticed these weird poles that they're putting up and down I-35.
[04:49:07.446 --> 04:49:09.228]  We live down here in Kyle, just south of you.
[04:49:10.169 --> 04:49:15.032]  And, um, they have these cameras on them and these, like, weird little dishes.
[04:49:15.032 --> 04:49:16.993]  Uh, like little square plates on them.
[04:49:16.993 --> 04:49:17.593]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[04:49:17.593 --> 04:49:26.378]  They've admitted that it's now Homeland Security and, oh, all the cameras will now be used to watch you and the gunshot detectors, they really are microphones that listen to you.
[04:49:26.378 --> 04:49:32.502]  I mean, I remember in 1998 they put wireless microphone shotgun mics all over Austin.
[04:49:32.502 --> 04:49:34.043]  And the company's website... And they can hear into your car?
[04:49:35.645 --> 04:49:37.486]  No, but you can hear it a couple hundred yards away.
[04:49:37.486 --> 04:49:38.827]  That was the whole demonstration.
[04:49:38.827 --> 04:49:40.628]  They call them gunshot detectors.
[04:49:40.628 --> 04:49:42.729]  And then now they're announcing everywhere these are going up.
[04:49:42.729 --> 04:49:56.998]  It's all Pentagon-controlled all over the country, but most of these cameras with a resolution are hooked into license plate reading software, and then that goes into the threat integration fusion centers put in by FEMA, and then they put army liaisons in with the police.
[04:49:56.998 --> 04:49:57.858]  I mean, it's hellish.
[04:49:57.858 --> 04:50:00.900]  It's the same system they've got to control Iraq.
[04:50:01.440 --> 04:50:05.021]  In fact, they bragged in MIT Magazine about it a few years ago.
[04:50:05.021 --> 04:50:07.482]  I was in a restaurant and saw a copy at the bar and was reading it.
[04:50:07.482 --> 04:50:13.845]  I already knew about it from other articles, but it was all there, bragging about how it's a surveillance grid.
[04:50:13.845 --> 04:50:20.127]  Yeah, I looked it up because we see them go up, and a lot of them are brand new.
[04:50:20.127 --> 04:50:23.789]  They're all up and down 35, and I figured you'd probably know because you're up in Austin.
[04:50:23.789 --> 04:50:26.170]  Well, tell us what you found out about the particular unit you're looking at.
[04:50:26.900 --> 04:50:28.342]  Okay.
[04:50:28.342 --> 04:50:29.743]  There's a website.
[04:50:29.743 --> 04:50:39.154]  This is really, really, really big, I think, personally, because this kind of technology, there's a lot of talk around it, what people call conspiracy and whatnot.
[04:50:39.154 --> 04:50:41.696]  But there's a site that's called Powercast.com.
[04:50:41.696 --> 04:50:42.838]  I don't know if you've heard of it.
[04:50:42.838 --> 04:50:43.739]  Have you heard of that?
[04:50:43.739 --> 04:50:44.600]  Powercast?
[04:50:45.643 --> 04:50:47.104]  Powercast.com.
[04:50:47.104 --> 04:50:50.706]  Boy, if you haven't heard of this, you're going to love this.
[04:50:50.706 --> 04:50:52.086]  Just go there, check it out.
[04:50:52.086 --> 04:50:56.348]  It's basically wireless electricity.
[04:50:56.348 --> 04:51:05.453]  If you know about Nikola Tesla, which I'm sure you do, and the listeners, if you know about Nikola Tesla, how JP Morgan shut him down way back when.
[04:51:05.453 --> 04:51:09.375]  Is this specifically, I mean, is this specifically dealing with these cameras?
[04:51:10.461 --> 04:51:15.183]  No, it has to do with RFID technology also.
[04:51:15.183 --> 04:51:19.564]  Is this specifically with these cameras?
[04:51:19.564 --> 04:51:20.925]  No, those cameras was a separate thing.
[04:51:20.925 --> 04:51:22.906]  That was a question I was asking.
[04:51:22.906 --> 04:51:26.107]  I doubt those are beamed.
[04:51:26.107 --> 04:51:27.027]  No, no, no.
[04:51:27.027 --> 04:51:27.787]  That was separate.
[04:51:27.787 --> 04:51:29.008]  I was just asking about those.
[04:51:29.008 --> 04:51:30.728]  I don't know about those cameras.
[04:51:30.728 --> 04:51:31.569]  I didn't know what they were.
[04:51:31.569 --> 04:51:33.429]  I didn't find any information about them.
[04:51:33.429 --> 04:51:37.031]  It's a wireless unit to a main station where they beam the signal.
[04:51:38.174 --> 04:51:40.523]  So it's not beaming power, it's beaming a signal.
[04:51:40.523 --> 04:51:43.434]  But you can with lasers like beam computer data.
[04:51:44.226 --> 04:51:48.167]  Well, this is Wire, this Powercast website.
[04:51:48.167 --> 04:51:51.367]  They claim that it's basically broadcast.
[04:51:51.367 --> 04:51:52.928]  It's energy broadcast.
[04:51:52.928 --> 04:51:54.248]  It's not even supposed to be around.
[04:51:54.248 --> 04:51:56.869]  This technology is not supposed to be around.
[04:51:56.869 --> 04:51:58.649]  And it's there if you go to it.
[04:51:58.649 --> 04:52:00.109]  And you know what's really creepy, Alex?
[04:52:00.109 --> 04:52:09.011]  If you look at the front page, you'll see that the way they have it all decorated, there's a guy, it shows a guy with a gun on there, you know, in camo, and all suited up.
[04:52:09.011 --> 04:52:11.832]  And then on the right, it shows, like, different features of it.
[04:52:11.832 --> 04:52:13.312]  And one of the things it mentions is RFID.
[04:52:14.372 --> 04:52:19.036]  That you'll basically have a device that's wireless that won't need a charge.
[04:52:19.036 --> 04:52:22.839]  It's self-charged all the time.
[04:52:22.839 --> 04:52:23.799]  Over a frequency.
[04:52:23.799 --> 04:52:25.701]  It has like a little antenna in it.
[04:52:25.701 --> 04:52:31.565]  You plug this thing with an antenna and you have anything else with an antenna, it takes the power wirelessly.
[04:52:31.565 --> 04:52:34.227]  This stuff's not supposed to be around.
[04:52:34.227 --> 04:52:36.409]  And it's out there now.
[04:52:36.409 --> 04:52:38.090]  I'm not hearing about it on the news or anything.
[04:52:38.090 --> 04:52:38.791]  This is huge.
[04:52:38.791 --> 04:52:41.893]  I mean, that's like breakthrough, crazy breakthrough technology.
[04:52:44.787 --> 04:52:45.567]  Alright, I'll look into it.
[04:52:45.567 --> 04:52:49.108]  There's also a lot of crap on the internet with fake generators and stuff.
[04:52:49.108 --> 04:52:50.188]  But thank you so much.
[04:52:50.188 --> 04:52:51.128]  I appreciate your call.
[04:52:51.128 --> 04:52:53.209]  Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
[04:52:53.209 --> 04:52:58.230]  Nah, I found a thing about Powercast.com that's not that.
[04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:59.930]  It's about casting metal.
[04:52:59.930 --> 04:53:00.970]  Whatever.
[04:53:00.970 --> 04:53:02.071]  Thank you.
[04:53:02.071 --> 04:53:07.032]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[04:53:07.032 --> 04:53:08.272]  Nick and PA, you're on the air.
[04:53:08.272 --> 04:53:09.332]  Go ahead.
[04:53:09.332 --> 04:53:10.813]  Yeah, hey Alex, Jason.
[04:53:10.813 --> 04:53:12.673]  I was hoping to speak with Michael Badnarik.
[04:53:13.086 --> 04:53:19.888]  This is Nick Kerangi in Philly, the man who got visited by Secret Service last year after confronting Bill Clinton.
[04:53:19.888 --> 04:53:21.088]  Sent a few goons out.
[04:53:21.088 --> 04:53:24.249]  Oh yeah, how dare you ask people questions, you're not allowed to do that.
[04:53:24.249 --> 04:53:40.453]  Well, you know, given the MIAC report, these Fusion Center documents coming out, I think it would be extremely prudent if we could take a moment and just discuss how to handle police encounters, how to handle yourself if you ever are to be interrogated by, say, the Secret Service.
[04:53:42.622 --> 04:53:48.125]  People have to understand that the Constitution is not from the point from which we derive our rights.
[04:53:48.125 --> 04:53:52.728]  It's simply the enunciation of what the government has to abide to.
[04:53:52.728 --> 04:53:54.029]  It's their contract.
[04:53:54.029 --> 04:54:02.234]  Your rights are enforced by you taking the initiative and upholding your natural rights.
[04:54:02.234 --> 04:54:10.219]  And that's the fact of the matter is that when we get into these conversations like Luke Radowsky and We Are Change Ohio folks did last week over at the Al Gore event,
[04:54:10.882 --> 04:54:14.985]  Uh, they're going to attempt to intimidate you, get you to incriminate yourself.
[04:54:14.985 --> 04:54:27.115]  And if you don't know your rights, then you're going to end up, uh, getting into adhesion contracts and signing away your rights for privileges.
[04:54:27.115 --> 04:54:28.416]  Yeah.
[04:54:28.416 --> 04:54:29.336]  Yeah.
[04:54:29.336 --> 04:54:29.596]  Yeah.
[04:54:29.596 --> 04:54:34.840]  So, um, I was, yeah, I was hoping that Mike Batner might give people a basic tutorial on that.
[04:54:34.840 --> 04:54:38.083]  But, um, and in my own experience recently, we've been getting into a lot of,
[04:54:38.746 --> 04:54:55.111]  A lot of constitutional issues in the courtroom, dealing with traffic disputes, just general civil liberties issues, and we're finding more and more that a lot of these adhesion contracts, the social security cards, driver's licenses, etc., are in many ways
[04:54:56.909 --> 04:55:00.370]  Sacrificing our God-given rights for the privileges of the state.
[04:55:00.370 --> 04:55:03.470]  Yeah, they have you waive them, and that was to get you trained to do it.
[04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:12.012]  Now they're just color of law, and by general acceptance, they've tried to make it like a common law, and they come after you if you don't have all of it, and they're so brainwashed they don't know.
[04:55:12.012 --> 04:55:17.313]  Now they're now saying Second Amendment's a privilege, and if we accept that claim, they'll then start enforcing it.
[04:55:17.313 --> 04:55:19.953]  It's like they claim traveling's a privilege when it's not.
[04:55:19.953 --> 04:55:20.674]  Thank you so much.
[04:55:20.674 --> 04:55:21.794]  Good to hear from you, Nick Keranji.
[04:55:21.794 --> 04:55:22.194]  Great guy.
[04:55:23.134 --> 04:55:25.955]  Let's talk to Luis in Missouri.
[04:55:25.955 --> 04:55:26.576]  You're on the air.
[04:55:26.576 --> 04:55:27.336]  Go ahead.
[04:55:27.336 --> 04:55:27.836]  Hello.
[04:55:27.836 --> 04:55:29.197]  Hi.
[04:55:29.197 --> 04:55:33.539]  I'm actually here with Representative Jim Guest in Missouri.
[04:55:33.539 --> 04:55:34.519]  This is our office.
[04:55:34.519 --> 04:55:42.923]  I wasn't sure he was going to be able to get down here because he is currently on the House floor and they have been back and forth voting.
[04:55:42.923 --> 04:55:47.765]  I didn't know that Jim Guest wanted to come on the show or I would have had him on.
[04:55:47.765 --> 04:55:50.487]  It's hard to get back and forth and I'll hand the phone to him.
[04:55:51.698 --> 04:55:58.926]  The real problem we're having, and like you, anything we say, everybody says, oh, that's crazy.
[04:55:58.926 --> 04:56:06.995]  We've tried for a long time, and I'll pass it along to him, but he's currently in and out of session, so if he has to jump out, I'll take care of it.
[04:56:11.254 --> 04:56:12.054]  Hello, Alex.
[04:56:12.054 --> 04:56:13.095]  Hey, Representative Guest.
[04:56:13.095 --> 04:56:15.235]  I didn't know you'd been holding while I was ranting and raving.
[04:56:15.235 --> 04:56:17.236]  Something big must be going on.
[04:56:17.236 --> 04:56:17.916]  Have you called in?
[04:56:17.916 --> 04:56:19.056]  I apologize.
[04:56:19.056 --> 04:56:20.076]  What's going on?
[04:56:20.076 --> 04:56:22.617]  We are voting on bills up on the floor.
[04:56:22.617 --> 04:56:23.497]  There's lots of debate.
[04:56:23.497 --> 04:56:24.458]  I ran down here.
[04:56:24.458 --> 04:56:26.638]  I heard that you were on about this.
[04:56:26.638 --> 04:56:30.860]  And, you know, the more I delve into this, the more questions people are asking.
[04:56:30.860 --> 04:56:39.062]  And I'm planning on having a hearing here in the State Capitol before my committee on Real ID and Personal Privacy, calling the
[04:56:40.956 --> 04:56:49.043]  Public Safety, the Department of My Act, and the Department of Highway Patrol request that they come to a hearing so we can ask them further questions.
[04:56:49.043 --> 04:56:55.348]  I just come trying to get somebody to admit that this is tied into the federal level, and that's where the directive is coming down to.
[04:56:55.348 --> 04:57:07.638]  There's just more unanswered questions, and every day we find out, like here in Missouri, that when you go to get your driver's license, they do a background check on you through a national database.
[04:57:07.638 --> 04:57:08.819]  Right now it may be
[04:57:09.591 --> 04:57:15.238]  Somewhat innocent as far as checking for lack of child support payments and a few things like that.
[04:57:15.238 --> 04:57:20.706]  But once they start that and link it to other databases, they're going to do a complete background check on you.
[04:57:20.706 --> 04:57:26.293]  So that's some of our concerns and let's say we're continuing to here and then with this fiasco at the St.
[04:57:26.293 --> 04:57:27.915]  Louis airport a couple weeks ago with the
[04:57:28.351 --> 04:57:29.072]  We're good to go.
[04:57:49.955 --> 04:57:50.115]  I think?
[04:58:10.084 --> 04:58:19.310]  I heard there's been some resignations and things, and then Lieutenant Governor, I know I've seen the press conference, came out and talked about how this is demonizing conservatives, libertarians, and others.
[04:58:19.310 --> 04:58:23.913]  So can you just briefly, Representative Guest, tell us where the bill is to get state sovereignty?
[04:58:23.913 --> 04:58:25.614]  Oh, that's great.
[04:58:25.614 --> 04:58:31.799]  I presented it in the Senate side yesterday, and I got a very positive response from it.
[04:58:31.799 --> 04:58:37.362]  The committee chairman, who is the Missouri floor leader, fully supports that, so I hope it comes to a
[04:58:38.820 --> 04:58:50.487]  A floor vote there within the next couple weeks and I would expect strong support for anybody that thinks they want to support the federal involvement in their government or private lives would be pushed to vote against it.
[04:58:50.487 --> 04:58:52.788]  So I'm very positive about getting that one.
[04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:56.810]  And I've got my bill to reject the real idea in Missouri moving along now.
[04:58:56.810 --> 04:58:59.191]  So we've got some good things going.
[04:58:59.191 --> 04:59:01.893]  You have to keep fighting to get them pushed through though.
[04:59:01.893 --> 04:59:05.355]  Absolutely, but there were some resignations and things over the MIAC report.
[04:59:05.834 --> 04:59:06.254]  Right.
[04:59:06.254 --> 04:59:18.540]  The director of the MIAC has been reassigned, let's put it that way, to another division there and they've got a new director and they've kind of admitted that's why I want to have my hearing.
[04:59:18.540 --> 04:59:24.443]  I think the employee was just writing that up and releasing it without basically any oversight at all.
[04:59:24.443 --> 04:59:28.145]  So that's certainly a responsibility in our department.
[04:59:29.249 --> 04:59:38.275]  Yeah, well the media's been trying to link Ron Paul, Libertarians, Conservatives to Terrorists lately, and to White Supremacists and others, and it's totally made up.
[04:59:38.275 --> 04:59:47.222]  They need to just deal with some of the groups that have shown they're violent and dangerous, and not mix people with Ron Paul bumper stickers into that, because there's no evidence of that and it's wrong.
[04:59:47.222 --> 04:59:51.705]  And fire out your website, Representative, for folks that want to find out more about the fine work you're doing.
[04:59:51.705 --> 04:59:57.269]  Okay, we've got two of them, the Lori Legislators Against RealID.com,
[04:59:58.263 --> 05:00:03.528]  And then my state website, it's JimGuest.com.
[05:00:03.528 --> 05:00:14.338]  And then I've got those there, and then I've got some links to some other sites, to my TheJimGuestShow.com, which I have a weekly radio program on that.
[05:00:14.338 --> 05:00:16.460]  Anyway, we've been working on this.
[05:00:16.460 --> 05:00:20.304]  We kind of discovered a few years ago that possibly this Dyack thing was connected to him.
[05:00:20.304 --> 05:00:23.067]  Now, some of the pieces are starting to fall in place now.
[05:00:24.073 --> 05:00:26.235]  Well, God bless you, sir, and I appreciate you coming on.
[05:00:26.235 --> 05:00:28.156]  We'll talk to you soon.
[05:00:28.156 --> 05:00:31.259]  Next time you contact us, let us know it's you.
[05:00:31.259 --> 05:00:32.860]  Thank you so much.
[05:00:32.860 --> 05:00:34.161]  Thank you, sir.
[05:00:34.161 --> 05:00:44.269]  You know, I've got to leave it there because I've got to go write questions for Aaron who's on a plane tomorrow to speak of Kansas City, going to Kansas City to interview a financial expert for the film.
[05:00:45.578 --> 05:00:48.302]  The second Obama film, it's really about Obama.
[05:00:48.302 --> 05:00:52.107]  The Obama Deception is about Obama, but how he's a puppet, a globalist, a front man.
[05:00:52.107 --> 05:00:55.812]  This is how they're going to financially destroy everything and bring in their new world order.
[05:00:55.812 --> 05:01:02.201]  And how the fraud's working with just top names and, you know, top economists, you name it, federal investigators.
[05:01:02.821 --> 05:01:03.821]  Uh, and others.
[05:01:03.821 --> 05:01:05.642]  So, that film is coming up.
[05:01:05.642 --> 05:01:11.223]  I've got to go do that now, and then go home and see the family, because I'm on Raleigh Jans for two hours tonight, then I'm going to be on your show at 11 tonight.
[05:01:11.223 --> 05:01:12.683]  No rest for us here.
[05:01:12.683 --> 05:01:13.943]  But it is insane.
[05:01:13.943 --> 05:01:18.924]  I've got to tell Rob Due, because I tell him all these guests I want on, and then he gets them on.
[05:01:18.924 --> 05:01:21.305]  I've got to tell him, just leave two or three days a week open.
[05:01:21.305 --> 05:01:30.427]  Because in the old days, I would just take call after call, and it was police, military, government, state reps calling in, and I never take calls anymore, or if I do, I make them hold for an hour.
[05:01:31.610 --> 05:01:33.031]  Or two or three.
[05:01:33.031 --> 05:01:38.916]  And then I never go to them because I'm so passionate and I know I'm out of control.
[05:01:38.916 --> 05:01:42.539]  The reason the show is getting so big is that we're real and folks know that.
[05:01:42.539 --> 05:01:46.922]  So even though I'm obnoxious and everything else it's because it's from the heart and I apologize to everybody else.
[05:01:47.062 --> 05:01:48.043]  Call in on Jason's show.
[05:01:48.043 --> 05:01:50.126]  He's good about taking calls.
[05:01:50.126 --> 05:01:50.987]  9 to midnight tonight.
[05:01:50.987 --> 05:01:54.471]  I'm only popping in a little bit on the back thing for about 20 minutes at 11.
[05:01:54.471 --> 05:01:55.433]  So we are out of time.
[05:01:55.433 --> 05:01:58.617]  Jason Burmas will have this whole 100-something page thing.
[05:01:58.617 --> 05:01:59.658]  You gotta go home and walk your dogs.
[05:01:59.658 --> 05:02:00.679]  I know I'm gonna come back.
[05:02:00.679 --> 05:02:02.381]  But you're gonna have this read and covered.
[05:02:02.381 --> 05:02:03.723]  9 to midnight tonight.
[05:02:03.723 --> 05:02:04.925]  The GCN Radio Network.
[05:02:05.285 --> 05:02:08.528]  Affiliates that pick up my show need to pick up Burmese's show.
[05:02:08.528 --> 05:02:09.449]  Need to grow that sucker.
[05:02:09.449 --> 05:02:10.010]  It is growing.
[05:02:10.010 --> 05:02:11.972]  So be sure and join him down at midnight tonight.
[05:02:11.972 --> 05:02:15.315]  And I'll be up on against him on XM and AM and FM's across the country.
[05:02:15.315 --> 05:02:17.477]  With Raleigh James for two hours tonight as well.
[05:02:17.477 --> 05:02:18.598]  No rest for us.
[05:02:18.598 --> 05:02:19.539]  Great job to the crew.
[05:02:19.539 --> 05:02:21.981]  That was a five hour, two minute show.
[05:02:21.981 --> 05:02:24.724]  We are out of here for a few minutes of rest.
[05:02:24.724 --> 05:02:26.145]  Then right back into the work day.
[05:02:26.145 --> 05:02:26.606]  Stay with us.
[05:02:30.362 --> 05:02:34.005]  I said, re-transmission starts now with Key Info, man.
[05:02:34.005 --> 05:02:35.106]  I'm not about to shut up.
[05:02:35.106 --> 05:02:37.789]  This is going to go on forever.
[05:02:37.789 --> 05:02:38.870]  Re-transmission starts now.
[05:02:38.870 --> 05:02:39.290]  Hold on.
[05:02:54.858 --> 05:02:55.658]  Hold on.
[05:02:55.658 --> 05:02:57.159]  You didn't go to rebroadcast, did you?
[05:02:57.159 --> 05:02:57.359]  Good.
[05:02:57.359 --> 05:02:58.899]  I don't want folks to hear what goes on here.
[05:02:58.899 --> 05:02:59.459]  Sorry, Burmese.
[05:02:59.459 --> 05:02:59.919]  Let's continue.
[05:02:59.919 --> 05:03:05.661]  Yeah, you know, again, Alex, right before guests got on, I read this part, which is just in the second page.
[05:03:05.661 --> 05:03:12.643]  This is a law enforcement sensitive information and is protected by the Code of Virginia Title 52-48 and 52-49.
[05:03:12.643 --> 05:03:19.925]  Further distribution of this document is restricted to law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies, and of course, Department of Defense organizations
[05:03:20.405 --> 05:03:20.745]  Only.
[05:03:20.745 --> 05:03:25.108]  Because you can't let the enemy, the American people, know what's going on, but they can let other governments know.
[05:03:25.108 --> 05:03:31.813]  And then right here, in big, bold letters, it says, no report or segment thereof may be released to any media sources.
[05:03:31.813 --> 05:03:33.234]  Well, too bad we have it.
[05:03:33.234 --> 05:03:36.196]  It's too bad it's going to be all over the web, and you're going to have to retract this one, too.
[05:03:36.196 --> 05:03:37.497]  You're going to have to apologize.
[05:03:37.497 --> 05:03:40.499]  And we know that it's not just in Virginia, it's everywhere else.
[05:03:40.499 --> 05:03:44.261]  Big time, tonight, 9 to 10, just on this 215 page document.
[05:03:44.261 --> 05:03:46.983]  I'm going to give people a shot of it, or they'll say it doesn't exist.
[05:03:46.983 --> 05:03:47.883]  Yeah, I know, it can't exist.
[05:03:50.465 --> 05:03:51.986]  Here, zoom in over here.
[05:03:51.986 --> 05:03:53.406]  Or, Burmy, just hold it up and they can see it.
[05:03:53.406 --> 05:03:55.326]  Yeah, it's right... yeah.
[05:03:55.326 --> 05:03:56.067]  The feds wrote it.
[05:03:56.067 --> 05:04:00.808]  It's the same exact wording of the... except for the state of the last document.
[05:04:00.808 --> 05:04:02.408]  It won't... it'll be blurred if you do that.
[05:04:02.408 --> 05:04:04.089]  That's how cameras work.
[05:04:04.089 --> 05:04:05.849]  It won't have the virus setting if you do that.
[05:04:05.849 --> 05:04:07.350]  Just back up and they can get it.
[05:04:07.350 --> 05:04:08.150]  Yeah, you got it.
[05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:09.490]  Everything's insane.
[05:04:09.490 --> 05:04:11.571]  Now, guys, you can zoom in on the Burmy.
[05:04:11.571 --> 05:04:14.192]  Okay, now I gotta go write these questions and then get out of here.
[05:04:14.192 --> 05:04:18.293]  I gotta go see my kids for a couple hours before I'm chained back up to the radio.
[05:04:19.553 --> 05:04:20.334]  But there it is.
[05:04:20.334 --> 05:04:22.034]  Hey, this is up on Infowars.com.
[05:04:22.034 --> 05:04:23.875]  I want Nemo to do a big report on it.
[05:04:23.875 --> 05:04:25.416]  No rest for you either, Nemo.
[05:04:25.416 --> 05:04:29.218]  And Watson supposedly has this big chemtrail report coming out in the near future.
[05:04:29.218 --> 05:04:32.619]  Okay, now that is the end.
[05:04:32.619 --> 05:04:35.841]  Oh yeah!
[05:04:35.841 --> 05:04:36.361]  We are out of here.
[05:04:36.361 --> 05:04:37.021]  God bless you all.
