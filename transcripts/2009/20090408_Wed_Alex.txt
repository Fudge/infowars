[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:00.649]  I think so.
[00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:19.715]  We're good.
[00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:39.906]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:41.367]  You want answers?
[00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:43.028]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.975]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:58.940]  We have a Chemtrail guest with Chemtrail Watch on the show tomorrow.
[00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.999]  Chemtrails are real.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:16.402]  Until 1996, all condensation ice crystal trails only formed at 20,000 feet and higher, generally in the winter months, and they faded out in a few seconds to the maximum of one minute.
[00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:17.723]  Your whole life, remember?
[00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:20.143]  Watching a trail go by and watching it disappear.
[00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:22.744]  Then suddenly in 96,
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.888]  Before anybody was even talking about chemtrails, I would notice, man, why do those stay there?
[00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:31.053]  I'd be, you know, gardening.
[00:01:31.073 --> 00:01:33.518]  If my parents had a couple acres in the middle of town, I would go garden.
[00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:35.818]  I like planting stuff.
[00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.939]  Call me a weirdo.
[00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:42.341]  But I'd be out there growing watermelons and stuff and stomping around and the flowers and the bees.
[00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:46.563]  And I'd go, man, that trail's been up there for like an hour and it's getting bigger, turning into a cloud.
[00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:47.123]  What's going on?
[00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:48.103]  It's like cloud seeding.
[00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:50.424]  And then by 97, chemtrails, chemtrails.
[00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.105]  And they add it to the jet fuel so it's compartmentalized.
[00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:54.186]  The pilots don't even know.
[00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:59.128]  And they have some others where they do know and they're spraying off larger amounts.
[00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:10.120]  And then suddenly government textbooks started admitting three years ago that they really were spraying the atmosphere to save us from the sun's rays and to fix the ozone layer.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:28.087]  And Paul Watson, I tried to Google it during the break, he wrote a big article six months ago or so, where the government admitted the chemtrails, and we had links to the government admitting, yes, we've got thousands of flights a year, we're spraying the atmosphere, testing, terraforming to save the Earth from global warming.
[00:02:29.324 --> 00:02:34.808]  And then NASA admitted a few years ago that the Earth is 20% darker now than it was before in the 1995.
[00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:43.394]  And then you show the satellite photos of the chemtrail sprays everywhere, how all the lines, like spiderwebs, cover up cities.
[00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.717]  I mean, they are manipulating the planet.
[00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.419]  Well, here's Associated Press.
[00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:50.479]  AP exists.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.422]  You know, it looks like when AP announces they're setting up global government and global currency.
[00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:57.124]  I get attacked and they say, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:02:57.164 --> 00:02:58.005]  I mean, literally.
[00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:03.221]  Now, this is AP, and we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv now, right?
[00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:04.662]  We are live.
[00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:05.703]  Okay, we went live at 8 after.
[00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:08.425]  I'm in front of the camera so much I don't even know anymore.
[00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.208]  AP, news break.
[00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:13.489]  Obama looks at climate engineering.
[00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.112]  Now, I want Paul Watson on this now.
[00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:17.653]  I want chemtrail every day.
[00:03:19.034 --> 00:03:21.776]  In fact, when I'm done with this next Obama film, I'm doing a chemtrail film.
[00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:22.236]  That's it.
[00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:23.137]  I've made my mind up.
[00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:27.221]  I was going to make the 2012 film explaining how that's all a big globalist hoax.
[00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.560]  But that can wait.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.124]  I need everybody to start sending me your chemtrail footage and we'll give you full credit and everything from all over the country.
[00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:36.645]  Just send your chemtrail footage.
[00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:37.646]  I'm making a chemtrail film.
[00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:37.946]  That's it.
[00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:39.488]  Because it's in.
[00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:43.290]  I should have made it a year ago when they were admitting it in textbooks and things.
[00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.293]  Because it really hurts the globalists to make a film and have them deny it and then have it be all admitted.
[00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:51.417]  But even when I document what's admitted now, they're going to say it doesn't exist.
[00:03:52.017 --> 00:03:58.382]  The President's new science advisor said Wednesday that global warming is so dire, the Obama administration is discussing radical technologies to cool the Earth's air.
[00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.324]  And see, this is in the university reports Paul's reported on.
[00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:04.366]  Oh, we're spraying the atmosphere, testing, shouldering the Earth.
[00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:09.750]  And kids' textbooks that have chapters saying New World Order say, oh, and we're spraying you.
[00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.732]  Those are that sunscreen spray.
[00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:14.997]  So, Paul Watson is now up on air.
[00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:16.237]  We're multitasking on air.
[00:04:16.697 --> 00:04:23.899]  Paul Watson, my chief researcher and writer, I have you here with a new mission, should you choose to accept it.
[00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:24.700]  Are you there, my friend?
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.160]  Yes, Alex.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.781]  I need you to do an article saying, yes, they are terraforming the planet.
[00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:32.422]  Chemtrails are real.
[00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:34.783]  Now, only one component is the terraforming.
[00:04:34.803 --> 00:04:38.404]  They're also spraying poisons on you that sterilize you and brain damage you.
[00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:40.687]  I know you don't want to admit that in public.
[00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:42.049]  It's because you've been brain damaged.
[00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.471]  Myself included, but I'm fighting through it.
[00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:47.134]  You can still focus and get some neurons firing there.
[00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.015]  We're trying.
[00:04:51.598 --> 00:04:58.825]  John Holdren told the AP, the first interview since becoming confirmed last month, that the idea of geoengineering the climate is being discussed.
[00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.667]  One such extreme option includes shooting
[00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.483]  Pollution particles in the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays.
[00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:09.208]  Holdren said such an experiment measure would only be used as last resort.
[00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:10.670]  It's already going on globally.
[00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.553]  The operation was launched worldwide in 1996.
[00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:13.734]  Worldwide terraforming!
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:21.142]  With deadly barium salts and aluminum dioxide.
[00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.763]  As now people 22 years old are getting Alzheimer's everywhere.
[00:05:25.123 --> 00:05:26.883]  Just breathing it.
[00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:27.963]  Mass death.
[00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:28.724]  Brain plaques.
[00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:29.404]  Hitting us.
[00:05:29.424 --> 00:05:30.124]  Hitting us hard.
[00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.765]  I mean, the globalists have special detoxes they do that can remove some of it.
[00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.425]  But they're even saying it's hurting them.
[00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:38.306]  I mean, this is mega attack total and AP!
[00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:45.708]  And I've got FBI calling the office and circling the office and provocateurs out the wazoo and people attacking everywhere.
[00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:50.310]  And I mean, and I'm the weirdo, because, no, listen, I'm breaking people out of their trance.
[00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.651]  See, I'm broken out of the trance.
[00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:55.152]  I'm angry, I'm freaked out, I'm going, my God, they're terraforming!
[00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:57.053]  My God, sodium fluoride in the water!
[00:05:57.233 --> 00:05:58.874]  My God, they funded Hitler!
[00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:02.095]  My, you know, I am, I understand what's going on!
[00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:04.296]  I read their eugenics documents!
[00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:08.638]  The Herald in the back of my neck standing up right now, I want to warn you, they should all arrest them!
[00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:09.678]  Arrest the bankers!
[00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.999]  They're robbing, God, I can't believe it!
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.260]  And then they admit,
[00:06:14.434 --> 00:06:17.197]  This is just like after they've been spying on us without warrants for decades.
[00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:19.459]  They come out and say, we might do a little spying without warrants.
[00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:20.580]  We want to pass a law now.
[00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:24.923]  Or, oh, we want a global currency.
[00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:29.668]  We want to pass a law when they've already been having it for years at the monetary level.
[00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.971]  I'm going to shut up, Paul.
[00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:39.296]  Paul, I just can't believe they're admitting it all, man.
[00:06:39.657 --> 00:06:40.317]  They're admitting it.
[00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.251]  And when they start admitting stuff, it means they're going full steam ahead.
[00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:45.392]  Watson, what do you think of this?
[00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:50.676]  Well, yeah, I wrote two articles on this last year.
[00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:57.502]  One was Government Scientist Proposed Geoengineering Earth's Upper Atmosphere.
[00:06:58.443 --> 00:07:05.989]  And this was about documents that were obtained by Cybercast News Service from the U.S.
[00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:10.233]  Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory.
[00:07:10.902 --> 00:07:13.965]  In Aiken, South Carolina.
[00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:15.927]  Well this one was about conducting tests about firing
[00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:35.018]  What would happen if a huge amount of particulate matter is shot into the stratosphere, that's the quote.
[00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:44.786]  And then they say they're testing, that's right, all of this spraying, like HIV is a weaker virus to the real, when they're gonna release, it's a beta test.
[00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:51.892]  But yes, but they admit thousands of ongoing tests with mixing it with a jet fuel, spraying the particulates into the atmosphere.
[00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:53.433]  I mean, that's what they're doing!
[00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:55.215]  That's why you say it's real!
[00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:57.597]  It's in the Associated Press, I keep telling you!
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.260]  Oh God.
[00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:26.863]  And there's also an article out of the Guardian called Geoengineering the Radical Ideas to Combat Global Warming, where Ken Calvera, who's at the Carnegie Institution in Stanford, California, promoted injecting the atmosphere with aerosols, as well as sulfur, which in this article, we list the health effects
[00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:38.812]  The Adverse Health Effects of Exposure to Sulfur, Neurological Effects and Behavioral Changes, Disturbance of Blood Circulation, Heart Damage, Effects on Eyes and Eyesight.
[00:08:39.113 --> 00:08:43.715]  Look what they're doing, what they're doing, what they're doing is saying, we're going to medicate you.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.582]  And, you know, that's why I always say, oh, they're spraying the town for a deadly moth this week, and I pulled up at 3 a.m.
[00:08:50.642 --> 00:09:03.347]  one morning and saw a Cessna fly over with spray tanks spraying, and I was like, like 200 feet off the ground right over my house, spraying, and I stood outside smoking a cigarette before I quit smoking, and smelled the pesticide coming down.
[00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:04.947]  I mean, do you see how they do it?
[00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:06.008]  They just set the precedent.
[00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:11.690]  Oh, yeah, we're going to be geoengineering, terraforming the planet now, it's no big deal, go back to sleep.
[00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.911]  Watson, but what was the term?
[00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.412]  The High Altitude Aerial Spring?
[00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:17.913]  What's the scientific term for it?
[00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:20.034]  If people Google it, they'll find thousands of reports.
[00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:24.977]  Something like that, yeah.
[00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:28.559]  The articles I wrote were about the... No, no, no, no.
[00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:30.260]  You wrote another one about that.
[00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:33.442]  You've written more articles than you remember.
[00:09:33.462 --> 00:09:39.405]  The one I wrote was entitled, Secret Geoengineering Projects Threaten Unknown Environmental Dangers.
[00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:44.464]  Which is the, uh, comprehensive article, which has got everything in it.
[00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:48.407]  Hey, hey, listen, it's like there's some collective amnesia on this.
[00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:50.548]  I've been begging for big reports on this.
[00:09:50.568 --> 00:09:51.949]  You did a separate report on this.
[00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.691]  We need hard-hitting reports to get people's attention.
[00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:56.793]  You always have scientific names to them and people don't read them.
[00:09:57.093 --> 00:09:58.194]  Let's bring John Harmon on.
[00:09:58.254 --> 00:09:58.994]  He remembers.
[00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:00.715]  John Harmon, come on here.
[00:10:02.877 --> 00:10:03.597]  Are you on air right now?
[00:10:04.578 --> 00:10:05.698]  Hey, tell folks the name of it.
[00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:06.219]  You got it right.
[00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:18.277]  Yeah, it's Indirect Direct Aerosol Spraying Campaign, that's right.
[00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:19.619]  Remember that now, Paul?
[00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:21.081]  Yeah.
[00:10:22.544 --> 00:10:25.548]  I need a master story that has it all so folks get it.
[00:10:26.923 --> 00:10:29.784]  Because, again, they are manipulating the atmosphere.
[00:10:29.824 --> 00:10:31.124]  These people are playing God.
[00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:32.884]  They are out of their minds.
[00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:38.106]  Remember, they thought that when they detonated hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere, it would catch the Earth on fire.
[00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:42.867]  This is on Discovery Channel on the show Trinity, voiced by William Shatner.
[00:10:43.347 --> 00:10:44.567]  It first aired on HBO.
[00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:45.987]  And they brag.
[00:10:46.007 --> 00:10:48.608]  If you watch that movie, get it on Netflix, folks.
[00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:50.651]  Called Trinity.
[00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:58.097]  That they detonated in one night 50-something high-powered hydrogen bombs trying to set the atmosphere on fire.
[00:10:59.038 --> 00:11:01.640]  Gee, this might set the atmosphere on fire!
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.082]  Let's try to set the atmosphere on fire!
[00:11:05.305 --> 00:11:07.267]  God, these people are psycho demons!
[00:11:07.947 --> 00:11:14.473]  Watson, I've got another guest coming up, but I want a big report later into the fourth hour on this.
[00:11:14.934 --> 00:11:20.198]  How fast can you get the AP up with them admitting they're going to terraform the planet with aerial spraying it?
[00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:21.339]  Yeah, it's already posted.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.501]  It's at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:11:24.122 --> 00:11:24.322]  Yeah.
[00:11:26.023 --> 00:11:27.825]  Well, our rewrite of it is.
[00:11:28.906 --> 00:11:31.028]  Yeah, with the link to the AP, yeah.
[00:11:32.506 --> 00:11:35.347]  All right, RxP, I want a master article detailing the people.
[00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:38.589]  Oh God, help us.
[00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:40.350]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:45.652]  As well as that, Alex, one third of fish in British rivers are completely feminized.
[00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:48.674]  I mean, what on earth have they put in the rivers now?
[00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:54.933]  And that's been linked with declining sperm counts in men as well for the past 20 or so years.
[00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:58.374]  Yeah, it was 85% down, now it's 95% down, the sperm.
[00:11:59.014 --> 00:12:07.797]  Well, I mean, and they've also done studies on waterways that aren't connected to any sewage system and shouldn't have the estrogen added, and they're finding it's synthetic.
[00:12:07.837 --> 00:12:08.518]  They're dumping
[00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:11.159]  Masses of amounts of it to the whole environment.
[00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:14.440]  They're spraying us with barium salts, sodium fluoride in our water.
[00:12:14.841 --> 00:12:16.141]  You put a fish in and it dies.
[00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.303]  They're, they're, look, look, I mean, it's over.
[00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:22.384]  We're being mass murdered by Nazi criminals that run everything.
[00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:26.326]  And meanwhile, they have all these newspapers attacking me because I'm exposing them.
[00:12:26.706 --> 00:12:28.807]  Watson, I want a masterpiece on this.
[00:12:28.887 --> 00:12:30.188]  I want to expose these bastards.
[00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:30.588]  Stay with me.
[00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:37.214]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[00:12:37.535 --> 00:12:39.216]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[00:12:40.537 --> 00:12:46.100]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[00:12:46.761 --> 00:12:50.163]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:51.524]  We have been warned.
[00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:57.848]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.861]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.222]  Why?
[00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:06.109]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:14.215]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[00:13:23.243 --> 00:13:23.923]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.

[00:13:24.844 --> 00:13:27.106]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:13:34.517 --> 00:13:36.620]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:44.171]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:50.889]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.130]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.691]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:55.771 --> 00:14:06.718]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:07.338 --> 00:14:08.639]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:10.360]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:17.187]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:25.557]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:26.057 --> 00:14:27.199]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:28.821]  The people strike back.
[00:14:31.198 --> 00:14:33.900]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:40.866]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[00:14:41.327 --> 00:14:45.590]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:55.679]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[00:14:56.109 --> 00:15:05.831]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:13.533]  Call me Dwayne Dalley at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:16.993]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[00:15:17.513 --> 00:15:19.734]  No amount is too small so start today.
[00:15:20.274 --> 00:15:25.941]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:35.630]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:44.197]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:47.780]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.003]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.405]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:56.487]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.
[00:15:56.768 --> 00:15:59.510]  Visit 2benatural.com and order today!
[00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.331]  We're good.
[00:16:15.865 --> 00:16:16.705]  He's going the distance!
[00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:57.926]  Ladies and gentlemen, the chemtrails are real.
[00:16:58.546 --> 00:17:10.092]  Just like they would deny there was a government plan to microchip the kids, and in Time Magazine and Newsweek, for kids, they give them free in public schools, say, ooh, you're cool, you're not like your parents, you're not backwards, you're gonna take the chip.
[00:17:10.532 --> 00:17:12.893]  That's a quote, by the way, from Time Magazine for kids.
[00:17:14.218 --> 00:17:15.439]  Oh yeah, turning your kids against you.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.882]  And now the Mexican Attorney General's made his employees take it, they're pushing it on Alzheimer's patients.
[00:17:20.922 --> 00:17:22.923]  The point is, they brainwashed the kids first.
[00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:26.565]  There's a bunch of government textbooks and others that admit they're chemtrail spring.
[00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:32.689]  Now, we found all the government documents where they admit they're already terraforming the atmosphere since 96.
[00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:34.050]  Guess what?
[00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.911]  When we found out the term,
[00:17:37.978 --> 00:17:40.499]  Indirect and direct aerosol spray campaign.
[00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:48.643]  You just Google that, you'll be on Department of Energy, British Department of Energy, and I hate to have my guests waiting and then going off and this is just too big.
[00:17:49.344 --> 00:18:01.970]  And then the last few months they had a London Guardian and AP come out and say, oh they're looking at spraying barium salts and they can mix it with the jet fuel that way it's cheaply done and it'll have a big effect over the airwaves to protect our cities.
[00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.431]  They're already doing it!
[00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:11.671]  And NASA reports the planet is 20% darker than it was back in the early 90s.
[00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:12.992]  They are spraying!
[00:18:13.272 --> 00:18:14.372]  Then they turn into clouds!
[00:18:14.412 --> 00:18:15.653]  It's cloud seeding!
[00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:22.676]  We broke, Ben Livingston, we broke that story before Fox, AP, any of them.
[00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:25.937]  A listener sent us the declassified document that the government had put out.
[00:18:26.297 --> 00:18:28.418]  It had been 40-something years, so they declassified it.
[00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:32.900]  And in the declassified government document,
[00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:40.668]  We talked about how he created hurricanes, killed hurricanes, weakened hurricanes, how with just a few airplanes they could do this.
[00:18:41.268 --> 00:18:42.129]  He ran the attacks.
[00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:44.730]  He would lead the squadrons in.
[00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.132]  He was a combat pilot before that in Korea.
[00:18:48.612 --> 00:18:49.272]  Amazing guy.
[00:18:49.552 --> 00:18:52.634]  He would lead the combat squadrons into Vietnam with no clouds.
[00:18:52.874 --> 00:18:55.155]  They would rain 10 feet of water on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.856]  And he interviewed us and then he got threatened that he won't come on anymore.
[00:19:00.876 --> 00:19:06.859]  He said, no, I've been basically threatened, I can't come back on your show, Mr. Jones, because we got him on, it broke, and then AP and everybody picked it up.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.763]  But the issue is that this is barium, salts, aluminum, dioxide, these are nuclei.
[00:19:15.803 --> 00:19:17.163]  What forms clouds?
[00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:24.667]  And now AP, you know, I apologize to Stuart Rhodes, but
[00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:27.885]  I bet he got a big response the last time he was on from Oath Keepers.
[00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:33.068]  They're having a big move to get even more people out to take the oath against firing on them U.S.
[00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:35.269]  citizens, confiscating guns, doing things like that.
[00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:42.834]  But side issue, Stuart, what do you think of them openly announcing they're terraforming the planet?
[00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:48.478]  I just came on and I just caught the tail end of your discussion about that.
[00:19:48.498 --> 00:19:49.299]  That's pretty amazing.
[00:19:50.199 --> 00:19:54.222]  So, off the deferential, I listened to the rest of what you said.
[00:19:54.824 --> 00:19:59.468]  Alright, well we're going to come back to you and give you some time to talk and I want to have you back up for a full hour in the near future after this happens.
[00:19:59.749 --> 00:20:01.370]  In a nutshell, tell us about Oath Keepers.
[00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:02.331]  Very exciting.
[00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:10.499]  So the police and military uphold their oath and don't go to war with the people, which will also be very healthy for them.
[00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:11.869]  Absolutely.
[00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:17.896]  This is our mission is to, as I told you last time, is to make sure that the big guns are on our side.
[00:20:18.437 --> 00:20:19.898]  And the response has been amazing.
[00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:28.309]  What I want listeners to know about is we are rallying on the Lexington Green on April 19th, which is the anniversary of the first shot.
[00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:29.349]  What day is that?
[00:20:57.978 --> 00:21:01.401]  Ah, 1775 maybe, that's when it all started.
[00:21:01.882 --> 00:21:20.957]  That's right, April 19, 1775 was when the, under Marshal Law, General Gage, he sent out his regulars to go confiscate the cannon and the doubter at Concord, and on the way in Lexington, Captain Parker and the Lexington Massachusetts Militia mustered on the green in face of the British, and that's where they had their first shots fired.
[00:21:21.617 --> 00:21:22.098]  I just had a vision.
[00:21:22.118 --> 00:21:24.541]  I've got to stop shooting by the end of April for my new Obama film.
[00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:27.884]  I'm going to send a camera crew and show this event at the end of the film about this being the solution.
[00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:43.287]  Absolutely won't.
[00:21:43.307 --> 00:21:44.569]  You need to be there, Alex.
[00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.672]  You're going to regret not being there if you're not there.
[00:21:46.692 --> 00:21:49.916]  I know, but I mean, literally, sir, I have enemy forces circling me.
[00:21:49.997 --> 00:21:51.138]  I'm here in the command base.
[00:21:51.619 --> 00:21:52.981]  I've got to stay here in the headquarters.
[00:21:53.802 --> 00:21:55.384]  OK, well, we'll definitely do that.
[00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.227]  You know what?
[00:21:57.267 --> 00:21:58.508]  I mean, I'd love to fly up there.
[00:21:58.548 --> 00:21:59.229]  It's just literally...
[00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.050]  Here's the issue.
[00:22:01.131 --> 00:22:03.392]  I could do 20 radio interviews a day on other people's shows.
[00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:05.574]  I mean, I'm reaching millions a day on my own shows.
[00:22:05.594 --> 00:22:11.938]  The problem is, believe me, I'd rather travel around and be part of this, but I can't be in all places at one time.
[00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:19.704]  I've got to kind of, you know, sit here at Midas Tareth, like we said last time, and I'm looking off at the eye across the mountain range at me.
[00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:22.366]  We're on the march.
[00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:24.467]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:25.408 --> 00:22:28.070]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:30.982 --> 00:22:32.484]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:22:32.664 --> 00:22:34.125]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:22:34.405 --> 00:22:36.647]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:22:37.088 --> 00:22:41.832]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:22:42.233 --> 00:22:45.075]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:48.879]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.051]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:23:08.431 --> 00:23:11.453]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:42.965]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:49.690]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.811]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:51.971 --> 00:23:54.353]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:23:54.433 --> 00:24:05.301]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:24:07.609 --> 00:24:08.890]  It's not about left or right.
[00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.670]  It's about a one world government.
[00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:17.473]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:27.456]  The Obama Deception.
[00:24:27.876 --> 00:24:29.057]  The people strike back.
[00:24:31.301 --> 00:24:36.766]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:37.326]  and the world.
[00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:41.049]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[00:25:55.698 --> 00:25:57.079]  I'm taking fight!
[00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:03.784]  Stand tall, baby!
[00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:05.965]  We are back live!
[00:26:35.017 --> 00:26:36.398]  Think of the insanity of it.
[00:26:36.418 --> 00:26:41.039]  The Associated Press admits they're spraying the atmosphere to save us from global warming.
[00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:44.840]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I'll sell you.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.041]  We've got a report and I forgot to talk to him.
[00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:50.282]  We have Mr. King
[00:26:52.034 --> 00:26:54.716]  Gary King on the line who does a radio show.
[00:26:56.458 --> 00:26:57.879]  Too much is going on during these breaks.
[00:26:58.439 --> 00:26:59.761]  Does a radio show in New Orleans.
[00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:01.082]  Great job.
[00:27:01.742 --> 00:27:09.208]  They were searching around and found a job placement order for pilots to fly these planes during the chemtrail spring.
[00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:13.391]  But we're trying to vet that job placement place.
[00:27:13.451 --> 00:27:14.331]  Gary, I know you're listening.
[00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:18.294]  Email that right now to robd at Infowars.com, the link.
[00:27:18.674 --> 00:27:21.095]  I'll go check it during the break, as you mentioned where it came from.
[00:27:21.115 --> 00:27:25.638]  I know they're linking to something else, but that's a little bit of a questionable operation, probably an operative group.
[00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:27.479]  It's from what I've seen in the past.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.400]  It's an infighting specialty group.
[00:27:29.841 --> 00:27:30.761]  So I want to...
[00:27:32.842 --> 00:27:33.162]  Go to the
[00:27:55.894 --> 00:27:56.634]  Going on there.
[00:27:56.654 --> 00:27:57.995]  So tell folks the date, the time.
[00:27:58.175 --> 00:28:01.997]  I may come, or I will at least dispatch Jason Burmess.
[00:28:02.377 --> 00:28:05.058]  It's his turn to be fired out as the InfoWar probe droid.
[00:28:05.078 --> 00:28:07.459]  I've been sending the whole crews out for shoots lately.
[00:28:07.499 --> 00:28:10.941]  If I could stay here, I'd have to spread myself thin here.
[00:28:11.681 --> 00:28:12.542]  Tell us about the event.
[00:28:12.582 --> 00:28:13.362]  Tell us what's coming up.
[00:28:13.382 --> 00:28:19.645]  Tell us about, again, the ten principles here on air with us with the Oath Keepers.
[00:28:19.705 --> 00:28:22.026]  Oh, and by the way, did you get a big response last time you were on?
[00:28:22.864 --> 00:28:23.567]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:28:23.587 --> 00:28:24.471]  Yeah, you bet we did.
[00:28:24.551 --> 00:28:25.214]  Thank you very much.
[00:28:29.463 --> 00:28:34.787]  We've got a flood of active duty military that are signing up and that are coming to Lexington.
[00:28:35.107 --> 00:28:38.109]  We're getting new, you know, we've got Marines coming from Camp Pendleton.
[00:28:38.569 --> 00:28:44.293]  We've got officers, 06 and above, coming from the Navy and from all the services.
[00:28:44.693 --> 00:28:45.714]  So it's been pretty amazing.
[00:28:46.054 --> 00:28:54.200]  So what we're going to do is April 19th on Lexington Green in Lexington, Massachusetts, right there where the first shots were fired in the American Revolution.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.320]  We're good to go.
[00:29:09.725 --> 00:29:10.185]  We're good to go.
[00:29:34.191 --> 00:29:39.593]  Absolutely, and again, Edwin Vieira, constitutional lawyer, constitutional law scholar, routine guest here with us, an amazing individual.
[00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:43.255]  The other gentleman, I'm aware of his work, great work as well.
[00:29:57.301 --> 00:30:02.062]  And I know the listeners have been trying to, you know, really energize their committees of safety.
[00:30:02.102 --> 00:30:19.665]  That's what began, as you know, but for listeners who may not, in the decade before 1775 and the Sons of Liberty, as the tyranny got worse and worse, they began to organize and petition and put out the information and say, look, you're committing crimes, you're abusing us, you better stop, better stop, better stop.
[00:30:19.965 --> 00:30:22.546]  And the Crown said, how dare you resist us?
[00:30:22.586 --> 00:30:23.906]  How dare you criticize us?
[00:30:24.586 --> 00:30:26.368]  Uh, you know, how dare you call for resisting us?
[00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:27.129]  That's treason.
[00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:28.250]  Same stuff we're hearing now.
[00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:31.273]  And I want to, you know, call out, uh, Dr. uh...
[00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:35.096]  Edwin Vieira and others is just great founding patriots.
[00:30:35.436 --> 00:30:44.360]  When Clinton was trying gun confiscations and announcing on MTV they were going to ban the guns and all of this, Edwin Vieira and others stood up and said, we need to remember the militia.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:58.186]  Every able-bodied man, the Second Amendment is enshrined that all men, like in Switzerland and other countries, are there to defend, and it's our sacred right and our duty to own firearms, and they called forth the real citizens' militia to defend against tyranny.
[00:30:58.226 --> 00:31:01.728]  That's why the feds then created the false militia, infiltrated it,
[00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:06.571]  With people saying, hey, let's hide behind the shed, let's dress in camo, let's build pipe bombs.
[00:31:06.871 --> 00:31:08.072]  It was always federally led.
[00:31:08.372 --> 00:31:11.114]  Creating a fake Viper militia out of a motorcycle team.
[00:31:11.454 --> 00:31:15.517]  They created the fake militia so the media could then demonize it and attack it.
[00:31:15.537 --> 00:31:18.619]  And the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center got caught running these groups.
[00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:21.301]  Mainstream News has reported on that.
[00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:22.081]  Elohim City.
[00:31:22.101 --> 00:31:24.082]  So, you know, that's the groups we're talking about.
[00:31:24.122 --> 00:31:26.584]  The real militia versus the counterfeit militia.
[00:31:26.624 --> 00:31:28.085]  Like, we're the real patriot movement.
[00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:30.767]  Then you've got Glenn Beck, who's definitely an operative.
[00:31:31.407 --> 00:31:37.332]  Who tries to get your confidence and then stabs you in the back as we predicted.
[00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:44.257]  So I just want to point out that this is people in the military, in the police, saying we'll just keep our oath.
[00:31:44.657 --> 00:31:49.321]  This is the key to not having a confrontation between the military and police and the people.
[00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.623]  Because if they're told to carry out unconstitutional orders, they won't.
[00:31:52.904 --> 00:31:59.509]  And then that won't bring in the ensuing hysteria and warfare that the establishment wants.
[00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:01.277]  That's right.
[00:32:01.817 --> 00:32:05.642]  And one thing I want to also mention is that Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be there.
[00:32:05.662 --> 00:32:12.671]  I invited him to come speak, and we've tried to get a message to Jack McLam, but definitely Sheriff Mack is going to be there.
[00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:16.516]  He has a new book out on the power of the sheriff and the responsibility of the sheriff.
[00:32:17.857 --> 00:32:19.978]  To be a barrier between the federal government and the people.
[00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:22.279]  Yeah, Burmese had him on Monday night.
[00:32:22.939 --> 00:32:26.001]  And certainly the audience is aware of that book he's got out.
[00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:27.041]  And that's certainly true.
[00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:29.842]  Kicking the feds out and getting local control again.
[00:32:30.883 --> 00:32:33.424]  How many people have contacted you overall on the site?
[00:32:33.464 --> 00:32:34.424]  I know it's getting a lot of traffic.
[00:32:35.445 --> 00:32:39.887]  Oh, several hundred thousand hits and just floods and floods of emails.
[00:32:39.907 --> 00:32:40.787]  Thousands of emails.
[00:32:42.158 --> 00:32:45.240]  We've got quite a response of people with their head in Lexington.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.983]  It's pretty short notice, we know, but it's pretty amazing how fast the response has been.
[00:32:50.044 --> 00:32:55.207]  Also, I've been invited to speak at a Tea Party Rally in Knoxville, Tennessee on the 15th.
[00:32:55.227 --> 00:32:58.190]  I might fly out there and do it impromptu.
[00:33:00.327 --> 00:33:01.428]  You know, get speech for them.
[00:33:02.068 --> 00:33:18.496]  And so what they want to do, they want to make it so that every protest from now on has an oath ceremony that men who have taken the oath in the past, veterans, or current serving military or law enforcement can step up and reaffirm their oath, and those who never have taken an oath to defend the Constitution can do so.
[00:33:18.956 --> 00:33:24.539]  And that would be pretty amazing to have thousands of people standing there with their hands raised and vowing to defend the Constitution.
[00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:25.920]  I think that's a really, really great idea.
[00:33:27.643 --> 00:33:30.930]  Absolutely, this is completely beautiful what's happening.
[00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:37.763]  Instead of the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, saying patriots and constitutionalists want to kill you, they're dangerous.
[00:33:39.077 --> 00:33:40.579]  The Founding Fathers are bad.
[00:33:40.939 --> 00:33:42.480]  We've got to confiscate the guns.
[00:33:43.001 --> 00:33:43.841]  We're saying no.
[00:33:44.002 --> 00:33:44.922]  Stand with the people.
[00:33:44.962 --> 00:33:46.344]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[00:33:46.644 --> 00:33:53.410]  Because if you let the bankers, who are openly taking the country over, use you against the people, like the IMF and World Bank do in third world countries.
[00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.371]  This is public plan.
[00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:56.612]  This is going to get really nasty.
[00:33:56.993 --> 00:34:01.577]  We're trying to short circuit the corporate controlled system, trying to cause riots.
[00:34:01.617 --> 00:34:02.478]  I'm sure you've noticed.
[00:34:03.718 --> 00:34:08.700]  That they're all over the media trying to hype rioting and civil insurrection so they can then blame it on us.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.221]  This is essential to stop this clash from happening.
[00:34:13.021 --> 00:34:14.041]  That's right, absolutely.
[00:34:14.801 --> 00:34:23.944]  If the military and the police realize their true duty to the people and to their oath to the Constitution, then it just can't happen.
[00:34:24.124 --> 00:34:24.744]  It's game over.
[00:34:24.804 --> 00:34:25.685]  It's checkmate for them.
[00:34:25.965 --> 00:34:28.886]  So they cannot do it without the military and the police.
[00:34:29.246 --> 00:34:29.986]  That's our mission is
[00:34:30.126 --> 00:34:32.428]  That's right, the globalists have to have enforcers.
[00:34:32.448 --> 00:34:33.749]  There's only a few thousand of them.
[00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.454]  And that's why they love the tragic murder of those three police officers by a white supremacist.
[00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:44.279]  And it turns out the white supremacist was attacking me on websites, but the Southern Poverty Law Center didn't care.
[00:34:44.579 --> 00:34:52.346]  They went and found those comments and tried to claim, you know, tie it to the Patriot movement, Ron Paul, myself, and everybody else, and now they've had to retract.
[00:34:52.666 --> 00:34:54.888]  But again, that shows they're scared of us.
[00:34:55.649 --> 00:35:00.351]  Uh, that they're resorting to tactics like that because they don't want the police and military joining us.
[00:35:01.192 --> 00:35:01.612]  That's right.
[00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:02.712]  That was Daily Kos, right?
[00:35:02.893 --> 00:35:04.913]  That, that, that first December campaign.
[00:35:04.933 --> 00:35:05.294]  Is that right?
[00:35:05.554 --> 00:35:06.834]  Yeah, they've had to now retract.
[00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:07.735]  So has Raw Story.
[00:35:07.775 --> 00:35:09.276]  So has the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[00:35:09.636 --> 00:35:11.537]  But the New York Times is refusing.
[00:35:12.037 --> 00:35:16.299]  And now, uh, Alternet and also George Soros' website is attacking us.
[00:35:17.159 --> 00:35:18.260]  Uh, that's Media Matters.
[00:35:19.195 --> 00:35:30.480]  You know, one of the Daily Post writers in another comment thread on their site was talking about if these gun owners, if they think they're going to be able to defeat the U.S.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.821]  government, we've got news for them.
[00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:33.802]  The F.U.T.S.
[00:35:33.842 --> 00:35:41.425]  talked about and bragged about being able to call in airstrikes and use artillery fire and flatten their homes and kill their wives and children.
[00:35:41.485 --> 00:35:42.906]  They're one of the regular writers.
[00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:46.347]  And so that's what, you know, it's reaffirmed for me that we're on the right track.
[00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:50.270]  Who is this enemy of the republic?
[00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.270]  I want to do a story on him.
[00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.572]  I'll look his name up.
[00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:55.213]  I'll email it to him.
[00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:56.754]  Yeah, look it up during the break.
[00:35:57.435 --> 00:35:58.896]  Because I want to go after these people.
[00:35:58.916 --> 00:35:59.836]  I mean, they love power.
[00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:02.718]  They're now bragging that they funded Pol Pot.
[00:36:03.559 --> 00:36:05.900]  Brzezinski is again a headline.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:06.961]  Google, I want to show that.
[00:36:07.601 --> 00:36:08.922]  German government says U.S.
[00:36:08.942 --> 00:36:09.543]  government funded
[00:36:09.983 --> 00:36:10.904]  Nope, it's not.
[00:36:33.462 --> 00:36:34.122]  That's exactly right.
[00:36:34.282 --> 00:36:35.342]  And it just pisses us off.
[00:36:35.483 --> 00:36:41.664]  The more we talk like that, the more anger we get, and the more resolved we are to make sure that they have nothing.
[00:36:42.004 --> 00:36:43.244]  They have no power over us.
[00:36:43.764 --> 00:36:58.408]  And so that's our job, is to not buy into their propaganda and their assumption that they've got... So you've got this phony leftist, quote, pacifist, bragging about all the power they've got now to the military and how they'll bomb our homes.
[00:36:58.548 --> 00:36:58.788]  Sick.
[00:36:59.878 --> 00:37:03.960]  Well now they support the Iraq War, now they support the carnage, because they're good liberals.
[00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:19.590]  Yeah, this same writer during the Bush administration was talking about how terrible it is to have civilian casualties, but now he turns around and says, ah, we're going to shell you, and we're going to call in airstrikes on you.
[00:37:20.566 --> 00:37:22.247]  Yeah, I'm looking for the link right now.
[00:37:22.427 --> 00:37:23.207]  They want war.
[00:37:23.287 --> 00:37:30.050]  These globalists, these socialists, they socialize our wealth, these controllers, they want a Russian Revolution here, folks.
[00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:31.370]  It's the same crew.
[00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:39.414]  And I'm here to tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that they intend to march the military and the police in against the American people.
[00:37:39.454 --> 00:37:40.794]  They've always hated you.
[00:37:41.074 --> 00:37:42.395]  They've always hated your freedom.
[00:37:42.415 --> 00:37:47.297]  They want to loot the middle class and give it all to George Soros, who says he loves the crisis,
[00:37:47.757 --> 00:37:50.658]  He engineered the crisis, he's having the time of his life.
[00:37:50.898 --> 00:37:51.938]  In fact, where's that headline?
[00:37:52.618 --> 00:37:53.038]  Here it is.
[00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:59.660]  This is at a press conference, so you Google, George Soros having a great crisis, you'll get hundreds of articles.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.281]  Zoom in on this guy, show him.
[00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:07.642]  I'm having a very good crisis, Soros says, hedge fund manager, makes billions off recession.
[00:38:08.822 --> 00:38:11.763]  He says it's very stimulating and the culmination of his life's work.
[00:38:12.283 --> 00:38:13.984]  It's his life's work to do this.
[00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:18.557]  Many brags on TV how they cut the oil prices to bankrupt the economy worse.
[00:38:19.058 --> 00:38:20.519]  This guy is sick, is he not?
[00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:22.280]  Absolutely.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:28.704]  I found his name, his name is Marcion, it goes by the name Marcion on Daily Kos and he writes all kinds of articles for them.
[00:38:29.504 --> 00:38:33.427]  And what's the name of the article where he says he wants to use the military to shell women and children?
[00:38:34.527 --> 00:38:40.431]  It's an article about, it was an article, let me see, it's called A Letter from a Militia Man with Poll.
[00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:45.119]  Which was posted by JC Wilmore, and what he had done is...
[00:38:47.226 --> 00:39:03.601]  A gentleman named Michael Vandenberg, who was involved in the militia movement back in the 80s, had written him a response to something he had posted about claiming that the GOP was responsible for militias and was fighting violence and things like that.
[00:39:03.921 --> 00:39:11.028]  And so he wrote him a letter saying, look, the GOP, as far as we're concerned, is morally bankrupt and is an empty shell.
[00:39:11.628 --> 00:39:16.311]  Your real problem is with the people of the United States, as Vanderbilt wrote.
[00:39:16.791 --> 00:39:22.474]  And so this guy posted his letter on Daily Kos saying, look at this wacko militia guy that wrote me.
[00:39:22.754 --> 00:39:27.277]  And then started talking about how we're going to stop these people and what we're going to do to the gun owners.
[00:39:27.337 --> 00:39:29.578]  That's the discussion thread of this guy.
[00:39:34.562 --> 00:39:46.111]  We've confirmed that one of the big shows on Air America, on in major cities, is saying I'm calling for violence and that I told the shooter to kill the cops when it turns out the white supremacist was attacking me.
[00:39:46.471 --> 00:39:48.713]  Now that's incredible libel, slander, defamation.
[00:39:50.906 --> 00:39:52.346]  Now, that's going on.
[00:39:52.987 --> 00:40:00.690]  We're here explaining the globalists have to have a breakdown of society and civil war to get away with the theft, because they need the U.S.
[00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.771]  to fall now that they've stolen the GDP in six months.
[00:40:04.092 --> 00:40:04.672]  It's already done.
[00:40:04.712 --> 00:40:05.292]  You can't fix it.
[00:40:05.312 --> 00:40:06.112]  It's so bad, folks.
[00:40:06.513 --> 00:40:07.613]  We're going to go into a depression.
[00:40:07.653 --> 00:40:08.313]  It's going to be horrible.
[00:40:08.574 --> 00:40:10.534]  But they intend to keep piling on the tyranny.
[00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:11.995]  They want to have a war.
[00:40:12.275 --> 00:40:13.456]  They want to have a conflict.
[00:40:14.525 --> 00:40:22.128]  And then they've got the nerve to say that we're behind this and we're doing this, and then they're bragging about how they want to use military against the American people.
[00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:27.330]  My God, I mean, do they have any idea how hellish this is going to be if this starts up?
[00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.331]  Here's what he says.
[00:40:29.371 --> 00:40:39.574]  He says, if these gun nuts think they can take the field against one of the most brutal war machines in the world, they would be disabused of that notion after the first airstrikes start coming in.
[00:40:39.594 --> 00:40:40.895]  That's what he says.
[00:40:42.694 --> 00:40:53.878]  So, and he continues on, talking about how, you know, uh, you think any American would be willing to charge a military convoy under helicopter fire or calmly watch as their house is leveled with their wife and children inside?
[00:40:54.438 --> 00:40:57.059]  That's the reality of asymmetrical warfare against the U.S.
[00:40:57.139 --> 00:40:57.399]  Army.
[00:40:57.739 --> 00:41:03.841]  They will rain down high explosives on you from distant distance while you're trying to land a lucky shot between interlocking armor plate.
[00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:08.503]  You think these bitches would really be willing to strap explosives on themselves around a police station?
[00:41:08.923 --> 00:41:10.884]  Not just once, but as a regular tactic?
[00:41:10.924 --> 00:41:11.544]  I don't think so.
[00:41:11.724 --> 00:41:13.945]  Yeah, he's calling the American people bitches!
[00:41:14.385 --> 00:41:19.328]  See, they have a total dista... When you listen to NPR, it's like... In fact, I have the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:41:19.608 --> 00:41:20.168]  Bring it to me.
[00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:22.610]  It was in here in the stack and somebody took it away.
[00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.650]  It was Newsweek.
[00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:24.611]  Oh, here it is.
[00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:31.074]  The End of Excess, Why the Crisis is Good for America by Kurt Anderson.
[00:41:31.534 --> 00:41:33.155]  Time Magazine.
[00:41:34.096 --> 00:41:39.919]  And they're saying, oh, this will teach us to live in our means while the control freak parasites sit on top of us.
[00:41:41.684 --> 00:41:43.365]  God, they have no idea what they're bringing in.
[00:41:43.385 --> 00:41:48.627]  They have no idea what they've done and uh... Oh my God.
[00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:52.088]  They don't understand, folks.
[00:41:53.248 --> 00:41:55.869]  They don't understand the differences between the United States and Iraq.
[00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.351]  That's why the Pentagon said they can't invade Iran because they couldn't win there.
[00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:06.873]  Iraq was an intelligence hive of the United States since the seventies and so they knew how to control it.
[00:42:07.974 --> 00:42:08.834]  And it was still hellish.
[00:42:11.437 --> 00:42:14.880]  But listen how they show who they are, bad-mouthing the American people.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.102]  Oh, I tell you, this is sick.
[00:42:17.423 --> 00:42:18.023]  This is sick.
[00:42:18.664 --> 00:42:26.711]  That's the same guy who, in another article, was lamenting any civilian casualties in Iraq, which is a worthy thing to say.
[00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:34.999]  But then when it comes to his political enemies, those he disdains, those that he considers to be the other, those he considers to be subhuman, which is us,
[00:42:35.655 --> 00:42:40.118]  You know, that he has no remorse whatsoever about bragging about how he's got a flat tire.
[00:42:40.138 --> 00:42:44.862]  No, we're the sub-human Americans that are pro-gun and pro-freedom that built the country.
[00:42:45.322 --> 00:42:50.766]  We're the sub-humans that pay his George Soros paycheck that they've sucked out of our economy.
[00:42:50.786 --> 00:43:00.914]  Well, you know, Communists always believe in purging and killing massive amounts of those they consider to be... Hey, I had the Zeitgeist guy on the show said I would be sent to re-education!
[00:43:02.932 --> 00:43:06.634]  And then I said, well that's wrong, and he said, you can't fathom our mind.
[00:43:07.474 --> 00:43:10.515]  They always say this, like some wooden apparatchik in the Soviet Union.
[00:43:11.196 --> 00:43:14.897]  We know best, and so it's okay to send you to a re-education camp.
[00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:18.859]  And I said, well that's tyranny, and he said, no.
[00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:20.860]  You don't fathom our mind.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.661]  You don't understand.
[00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:29.064]  And then I guess if I can't be re-educated, gotta break a few eggs.
[00:43:29.124 --> 00:43:29.524]  Stay there.
[00:43:30.987 --> 00:43:32.909]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.072]  It's time to think outside the box.
[00:43:35.432 --> 00:43:37.134]  How about starting your own garden?
[00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.497]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.

[00:44:31.378 --> 00:44:36.701]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:37.221 --> 00:44:44.185]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:50.952]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:51.353 --> 00:44:53.193]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:53.333 --> 00:44:55.754]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:55.834 --> 00:45:06.779]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:45:07.399 --> 00:45:08.699]  It's not about left or right.
[00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:10.440]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:45:10.931 --> 00:45:17.259]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:25.630]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:26.111 --> 00:45:27.273]  The Obama Deception.
[00:45:27.693 --> 00:45:28.875]  The people strike back.
[00:45:30.965 --> 00:45:31.786]  Attention gardeners!
[00:45:31.866 --> 00:45:34.209]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:38.794]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:45:38.995 --> 00:45:46.884]  It's called Proto-Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:45:47.205 --> 00:45:50.028]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:45:50.302 --> 00:45:57.824]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:45:57.924 --> 00:46:03.526]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:46:03.746 --> 00:46:09.308]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:46:09.588 --> 00:46:12.829]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:46:13.129 --> 00:46:16.493]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:46:16.714 --> 00:46:21.780]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.664]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:46:24.684 --> 00:46:24.884]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.181]  I'm making the new Obama film.
[00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:41.162]  I mean, new.
[00:46:41.182 --> 00:46:42.503]  The Obama Deception is brand new.
[00:46:42.523 --> 00:46:43.444]  It's number one out there.
[00:46:43.464 --> 00:46:49.568]  It'll be out on July 4th and it's gonna have the great folks, the Oath Keepers in it.
[00:46:49.588 --> 00:46:54.151]  So I was already thinking about going and interviewing Edwin Vieira, the doctor, and a few others for it.
[00:46:54.171 --> 00:46:55.451]  I just thought, I'm too busy.
[00:46:55.471 --> 00:46:56.332]  We've got enough interviews.
[00:46:56.852 --> 00:47:00.815]  But I knew there was something else that needed to be added and I was gonna, we're sending folks to some tea parties.
[00:47:01.455 --> 00:47:02.696]  But no, no, this is key.
[00:47:02.776 --> 00:47:03.397]  This is key.
[00:47:04.915 --> 00:47:07.437]  And so I'm very, very excited about that.
[00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:10.720]  And hey guys, I want you guys to decide who's going to go.
[00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:11.962]  We need to go ahead and get plane tickets.
[00:47:13.023 --> 00:47:16.326]  It's on April 19th on that Sunday, but I want you to talk to Edwin Vieira.
[00:47:16.986 --> 00:47:22.371]  I want you to go ahead and talk to them and set up times to interview them at their hotel the night before or the day after.
[00:47:23.112 --> 00:47:32.119]  And we'll also interview the amazing Stuart Rhodes for the film, because I'm trying to make the films about other people other than myself, but then it's always me out doing the activism.
[00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:37.383]  I'm going to attempt to probably, just because I'm, frankly, the films sell better if I'm in them.
[00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:41.226]  Everybody's told me that, but this one probably won't have Alex Jones or a voiceover.
[00:47:41.246 --> 00:47:48.392]  Well, it's going to have a little bit of me doing a voiceover or I'm going to do little pop-ins on video, but not a lot of Alex is the point.
[00:47:49.676 --> 00:47:50.977]  And so we're on.
[00:47:51.097 --> 00:47:51.478]  We're on.
[00:47:51.498 --> 00:47:52.438]  We're going to send somebody.
[00:47:52.759 --> 00:47:56.322]  I'm going to have at least two of my guys up there and we'll get all that done.
[00:47:56.342 --> 00:48:00.165]  We're going to call Dr. Vieira and get all that lined up as well.
[00:48:00.926 --> 00:48:04.929]  But look, Stuart Rhodes, I'll have you back up in the next few weeks as this builds.
[00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:06.991]  Give people the details again.
[00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:15.659]  Fire off the website of police and military coming and pledging en masse publicly or they can do it incognito with a pseudonym saying, I'm going to uphold the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:48:16.926 --> 00:48:19.988]  That's oath-keepers.blogspot.com.
[00:48:20.529 --> 00:48:21.910]  And we've got a brand new video out.
[00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.572]  We put our 10 orders will not obey on video.
[00:48:24.612 --> 00:48:25.713]  It's on YouTube right now.
[00:48:26.493 --> 00:48:27.474]  Please send it around.
[00:48:28.095 --> 00:48:29.876]  And also we could use our user support.
[00:48:29.976 --> 00:48:34.740]  We run pretty lean and we're kind of like outpacing our own supply line, kind of like Patton did.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.663]  But we could definitely give you some support to help further our efforts.
[00:48:38.943 --> 00:48:47.446]  Well, I'm going to have my crew there, and so set aside a time for us to interview you for about an hour or so in your hotel room, or in a conference room where there's not a lot of noise, and we need to interview Dr. Edwin Vieira and everybody else.
[00:49:01.641 --> 00:49:08.985]  And Dan Ipsen is going to be there, and Joe Bonick, legislators who sponsored some of the sovereignty initiatives are going to be there as well.
[00:49:10.346 --> 00:49:13.448]  Okay, do me a favor, will you send me, will you send me all, you want to go?
[00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:15.349]  Okay, we're going to send Rob Dew and Burmess.
[00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:23.133]  Will you do me a favor, will you, I'm sending Aaron to Kansas City this weekend for an interview.
[00:49:23.173 --> 00:49:24.774]  This film's got a lot of cool interviews in it.
[00:49:28.786 --> 00:49:33.728]  Yeah, do me a favor, will you email Rob Due all those guys' contacts so that we can have the interviews lined up before we get there?
[00:49:33.748 --> 00:49:40.251]  Because it'll be... It won't happen if we show up while they're busy shaking hands for two hours and try to get the interviews and then it's all pointless.
[00:49:41.031 --> 00:49:47.334]  Well, very, very exciting and people should go up to the site and read the ten things you will not do because those are all the things that are being asked to be done.
[00:49:47.354 --> 00:49:48.635]  Can you believe all these liberal sites?
[00:49:48.655 --> 00:49:50.856]  And I was just given more mainstream newspapers attacking me.
[00:49:51.496 --> 00:50:08.402]  Including the New York Times, are saying we're making it up that Obama wants to restrict guns, when he says, oh I'm for the Second Amendment, we're not going to ban, this is a quote, we're not going to ban all the guns overnight, we're just going to restrict them incrementally, and his Chief of Staff and Attorney General are for total gun bans on record.
[00:50:08.442 --> 00:50:12.503]  I mean, how can they just keep lying and saying they're not for this as they do it?
[00:50:13.444 --> 00:50:14.644]  Well, it's part of their strategy.
[00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:18.083]  It's like this Marcion guy, I want to read this to you real quick.
[00:50:18.363 --> 00:50:21.465]  He says, I don't think American soldiers would hesitate to kill Americans.
[00:50:21.825 --> 00:50:23.246]  They are a very professional force.
[00:50:23.306 --> 00:50:31.469]  And then he says, after the demonization job that would be done by the media, Americans would be positively demanding airstrikes on their own cities.
[00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:32.450]  That's what he says.
[00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:43.676]  Yeah, communists are always, and socialists are always, real cold-blooded and into the Machiavellian mind, and they just love getting in a power position and imagining what they do.
[00:50:43.876 --> 00:50:58.904]  Oh, we would demonize the gun owners, and then we'd airstrike them, and oh God, I can't wait, we're so close to getting these gun owners, we're so close to bombing their families, oh God, I've got Foundation money and Soros money, we're butchering America, the global tax is here,
[00:50:59.164 --> 00:51:03.788]  We've stalled the people long enough, and we're so close to turn the military and police against the people.
[00:51:03.868 --> 00:51:05.190]  It's gonna be so good!
[00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.672]  Oh, we can't wait to destroy America!
[00:51:07.812 --> 00:51:08.273]  Yes!
[00:51:08.713 --> 00:51:09.113]  Yes!
[00:51:09.434 --> 00:51:10.395]  Oh, it's so good!
[00:51:10.415 --> 00:51:14.378]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.941]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:22.258]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:22.358 --> 00:51:27.020]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.861]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:30.061 --> 00:51:32.922]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:33.102 --> 00:51:37.824]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:38.044 --> 00:51:38.965]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:39.185 --> 00:51:42.147]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:42.427 --> 00:51:49.331]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:52.553]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:52.893]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:52.953 --> 00:51:54.574]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:57.836 --> 00:52:03.902]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:52:04.102 --> 00:52:07.846]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:52:07.866 --> 00:52:09.207]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:52:09.228 --> 00:52:09.808]  Take action today.
[00:52:09.848 --> 00:52:11.830]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:52:23.524 --> 00:52:25.425]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:25.905 --> 00:52:28.847]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:34.870]  We have to believe we can fight the New World Order.
[00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.192]  We have to believe we can have victory.
[00:52:47.608 --> 00:52:54.152]  Now, you're going to see the COINTELPRO operatives and their unwitting dupes who are just conned.
[00:52:55.493 --> 00:53:09.441]  You've seen this from Rolling Stone and other books and magazine articles that I've seen over the years where they're claiming, oh my God, the Republican Party has right-wing militias that want to overthrow the government and kill everybody.
[00:53:09.901 --> 00:53:11.983]  That's George Soros propaganda.
[00:53:13.326 --> 00:53:23.793]  And so he was just mentioning, that's what made me think of it, our guest, Stuart Rhodes, worked with the Ron Paul campaign at the highest levels, now spinning off doing this, saying to the police and military, hey, join the Republic, join the Bill of Rights.
[00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:25.434]  We're the good guys.
[00:53:25.795 --> 00:53:27.216]  We're not the Republican Party.
[00:53:27.476 --> 00:53:28.837]  We're not the Democratic Party.
[00:53:29.237 --> 00:53:32.059]  You know, they claimed I worked for the Democrats secretly when I was attacking Bush.
[00:53:32.579 --> 00:53:33.260]  Vice versa.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:44.833]  We are trying to get the military and police to defend the Bill of Rights Constitution, not fire on Americans, not get in shootouts with law-abiding citizens, not have gun confiscations, not have secret arrest of citizens.
[00:53:45.413 --> 00:53:48.717]  All the things that are now admitted, that are going on, they're trying.
[00:53:49.198 --> 00:53:53.082]  Who could say that isn't a wholesome, good thing, and to have them upkeep their oath?
[00:53:53.723 --> 00:53:59.286]  Well, George Soros and their crowd are hopping mad because, believe me, we are the resistance.
[00:53:59.886 --> 00:54:01.667]  You want to know who's resisting this new world order?
[00:54:01.687 --> 00:54:06.290]  You want to know who's at the tip of the spear and who's affecting change and who they're worried about?
[00:54:07.932 --> 00:54:09.872]  That's why we have Republicans and Democrats.
[00:54:09.892 --> 00:54:15.074]  You have Glenn Beck saying the FEMA camps aren't real, we're all cooks, you know, restaurant Paul supporters, but then he's still our best friend.
[00:54:15.754 --> 00:54:17.954]  You've got all the big liberal sites doing it.
[00:54:18.414 --> 00:54:25.796]  And their own members are posting, the majority of comments, are countering him, going, no, no, Alex Jones is good, you know, he calls for nonviolence.
[00:54:25.836 --> 00:54:27.376]  As they go, Jones says kill cops!
[00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:29.257]  This isn't going to work.
[00:54:29.397 --> 00:54:30.617]  And anybody you hear
[00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:36.020]  Putting that out as an operative, folks, you want to know instantly who an operative is.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:36.580]  That's how you know.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.642]  Going back briefly to Stuart Rhodes, I appreciate doing what he's done.
[00:54:40.662 --> 00:54:45.365]  Look, he's taken up the mantle, taken up the leadership, energizing and having a huge effect.
[00:54:45.765 --> 00:54:48.507]  Tens of thousands of police and military on record saying
[00:54:48.507 --> 00:54:51.810]  Saying we, and sending in their photos, or sending in a picture of their ring.
[00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:53.171]  They can be public or not public.
[00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:54.372]  A lot of them want to be public.
[00:54:54.672 --> 00:54:55.853]  Saying we're not going along.
[00:54:55.873 --> 00:54:57.115]  And then we're the mainstream.
[00:54:57.195 --> 00:54:58.035]  We're the majority.
[00:54:58.296 --> 00:54:59.557]  We're the constitutionalists.
[00:54:59.857 --> 00:55:01.619]  That's why the feds bombed Oklahoma City.
[00:55:02.475 --> 00:55:05.356]  Was to put a chilling effect on the Patriot Movement and claim we did it.
[00:55:05.696 --> 00:55:07.397]  Well, we're not even calling this a Patriot Movement.
[00:55:07.597 --> 00:55:10.117]  This is a constitutional movement against tyranny.
[00:55:10.938 --> 00:55:16.919]  And you notice the operatives are going to say we're violent and seize on any opportunity to frame us and cast us that way.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.280]  It isn't going to work.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:25.342]  The police and military are now understanding they want to get a war started between the American people because a divided house cannot stand.
[00:55:25.382 --> 00:55:28.063]  We've got to come together for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:55:28.103 --> 00:55:31.104]  You stand with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson,
[00:55:32.856 --> 00:55:33.917]  And the Founding Fathers?
[00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:42.425]  Or do you stand with George Bush and George Soros and with Barack Obama and Zbigniew Brzezinski?
[00:55:43.826 --> 00:55:44.807]  They're demonizing us!
[00:55:44.867 --> 00:55:45.547]  What does that tell you?
[00:55:46.108 --> 00:55:50.072]  In closing, tell folks about the website, when the event is, April 18th and April 19th.
[00:55:51.713 --> 00:55:56.157]  We are Oath-Keepers, which is Oath-Keepers.blogspot.com
[00:55:59.037 --> 00:56:03.279]  And you can go there and read testimonials from active military, retired, and police.
[00:56:03.739 --> 00:56:06.761]  And we are rallying on the Green at Lexington on April 19th.
[00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:08.922]  We'll actually be there Saturday, the 18th.
[00:56:09.622 --> 00:56:19.447]  And on Sunday, the 19th of April, at Lexington, Massachusetts, to reaffirm our oaths, to read aloud to the whole world our Declaration of Orders.
[00:56:19.467 --> 00:56:20.348]  We will not obey.
[00:56:20.928 --> 00:56:23.049]  And to put it on film and let it go viral.
[00:56:23.289 --> 00:56:24.570]  And throw down the gauntlet.
[00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.992]  And make it clear to them that we're not going to play along.
[00:56:45.228 --> 00:56:46.669]  I may come there, I may do that.
[00:56:46.689 --> 00:56:50.333]  I just don't want to have my hotel robbed or anything, so I'd like to not announce what I'm doing.
[00:56:50.753 --> 00:56:55.197]  The point is, is that we are taking action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:55.217 --> 00:56:56.218]  I will have people there.
[00:56:56.638 --> 00:56:58.060]  Be there the 18th and 19th.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.381]  Again, give folks the town the place.
[00:57:00.524 --> 00:57:01.224]  This is beautiful.
[00:57:01.244 --> 00:57:01.804]  This is beautiful.
[00:57:01.824 --> 00:57:06.925]  This is real resistance to tyranny, a real counter-revolution to the globalist revolution to overthrow our republic.
[00:57:07.005 --> 00:57:08.406]  We are restorationists.
[00:57:08.426 --> 00:57:09.866]  Thank you so much, Mr. Rhodes.
[00:57:31.112 --> 00:57:32.533]  So you want to stop smoking.
[00:57:32.593 --> 00:57:33.694]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[00:57:33.874 --> 00:57:36.637]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[00:57:36.757 --> 00:57:40.580]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:44.284]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[00:57:44.504 --> 00:57:46.465]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[00:57:46.525 --> 00:57:50.429]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:57.593]  Smoke Free is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[00:57:57.893 --> 00:58:06.959]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke free book, an audio support program, capsule holder,
[00:58:07.179 --> 00:58:09.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:37.026 --> 00:58:44.107]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:50.809]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:51.189 --> 00:58:53.009]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:53.149 --> 00:58:55.570]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:55.670 --> 00:59:06.452]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:59:07.248 --> 00:59:08.529]  It's not about left or right.
[00:59:08.909 --> 00:59:10.311]  It's about a one world government.
[00:59:10.771 --> 00:59:17.096]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:59:17.677 --> 00:59:25.463]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:25.944 --> 00:59:27.105]  The Obama Deception.
[00:59:27.525 --> 00:59:28.786]  The people strike back.
[00:59:30.748 --> 00:59:31.228]  You worry.
[00:59:31.638 --> 00:59:33.339]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.921]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:59:36.342 --> 00:59:38.143]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:59:38.463 --> 00:59:39.664]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:59:40.084 --> 00:59:43.267]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:48.531]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:59:48.911 --> 00:59:52.234]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:59:52.874 --> 00:59:54.215]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:59:54.575 --> 00:59:57.177]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:59:57.478 --> 01:00:00.420]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:00:00.905 --> 01:00:09.088]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:00:09.548 --> 01:00:13.930]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:18.071]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[01:00:18.391 --> 01:00:22.372]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:00:22.412 --> 01:00:23.773]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:00:23.793 --> 01:00:25.514]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:00:32.489 --> 01:00:38.514]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:39.115 --> 01:00:42.158]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:48.143]  I could have this next guest on for 10 hours.
[01:00:48.183 --> 01:00:49.164]  What a political mind.
[01:00:49.184 --> 01:00:52.006]  I want to have him back up on the show on a routine basis.
[01:00:54.969 --> 01:00:58.111]  I apologize for moving him from Monday to today.
[01:00:58.732 --> 01:01:02.434]  I just had national media trying to frame me as a cop killer.
[01:01:02.514 --> 01:01:06.297]  Last week it was trying to frame me, alternative media, as a murderer of a talk show host.
[01:01:06.837 --> 01:01:09.439]  So the attacks are really getting bad.
[01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:17.384]  I mean, it's getting crazy because even the national media is identifying me as the leader of the anti-government movement.
[01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:24.609]  Well, if anti-government means I'm against gun confiscation, 12.8 trillion stolen in six months by offshore banks,
[01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:29.731]  Tennessee newspapers reporting that the governor said no army checkpoints and they still did it?
[01:01:30.232 --> 01:01:31.592]  I mean, that's confirmed!
[01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:35.214]  Marines out running checkpoints around the country suddenly?
[01:01:35.614 --> 01:01:37.435]  I mean, we are entering the vortex!
[01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:50.742]  And then now the Associated Press, we've got a big article going up on PrisonPlanet.com on this, the Associated Press comes out and admits that there's chemtrails spraying
[01:01:51.812 --> 01:01:57.034]  Going on by the government for our safety that they are spraying.
[01:01:58.854 --> 01:02:07.977]  Obama looks at climate engineering, I mean, and then we found all these government sites where they admit it's a giant worldwide program where they're manipulating.
[01:02:07.997 --> 01:02:09.377]  There's AP on your screen!
[01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:11.998]  And I've always known they were spraying.
[01:02:12.038 --> 01:02:14.199]  I mean, these trails didn't stay in the sky before 96.
[01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:25.216]  Then we got other government documents and talked to whistleblowers, but now they put out high school and college textbooks saying the government's spraying the sky to keep you safe from UV radiation.
[01:02:26.485 --> 01:02:38.833]  And then there's thousands of government studies where they admit they're doing it, and then we see all these, and then the AP admits it, and Obama gives an interview, and talks about, I mean, and I'm still going to be called a kook!
[01:02:38.913 --> 01:02:48.359]  I mean, they've announced every world, world government run by the bankers that you pay taxes to, that rules the entire earth with an 80% tax rate run by the OECD.
[01:02:50.054 --> 01:02:52.035]  I'd read Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, U.N.
[01:02:52.696 --> 01:02:58.939]  OECD documents ten years ago where they said we'll have an 80-plus percent tax rate, one-child policies, carbon taxes on everybody.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.141]  And I went on air and said, here they are saying it.
[01:03:01.401 --> 01:03:05.343]  You know, here's CFR last year calling for world government, global governance, carbon taxes.
[01:03:05.844 --> 01:03:08.705]  Headline, International Institutions and Global Governance Program.
[01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:11.027]  CFR.org!
[01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.669]  No liberties, no freedoms, total control.
[01:03:16.158 --> 01:03:17.258]  And people are denying that!
[01:03:17.278 --> 01:03:18.778]  I mean, I'm being attacked right now.
[01:03:19.199 --> 01:03:29.760]  They just walked in and gave me two more newspapers attacking me, saying I'm dangerous and calling for violence, when I'm calling to stop violence, and saying I'm making up all of this stuff when it's all over the news!
[01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:35.221]  Let me tell you, folks, I've got to chill up my spine, because I know what that means.
[01:03:35.281 --> 01:03:41.382]  The fact that they're bringing me out this big means they're planning to really try to do something to us, and I just pray for us, folks.
[01:03:41.663 --> 01:03:43.603]  Let's go to Michael Bagner, a constitutional scholar.
[01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.259]  To talk about all these things that are happening.
[01:03:46.939 --> 01:03:49.600]  Presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, 2004.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.681]  Michael Bagneri, good to have you here with us.
[01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:57.262]  I'm so pleased to be here, Alex, and I want to congratulate you.
[01:03:57.402 --> 01:04:03.644]  The fact that they are making all of these attacks means that you have been doing a fantastic job.
[01:04:03.964 --> 01:04:07.366]  That you really are a threat to the New World Order.
[01:04:07.866 --> 01:04:08.426]  I'm envious.
[01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:12.876]  Well, don't envy him until you've been in the position, Michael.
[01:04:12.896 --> 01:04:21.222]  Well, you've been all over national television and got nationally attacked when you were the Libertarian Party candidate for president, getting so much attention, so you've actually been there before.
[01:04:21.262 --> 01:04:27.307]  But, no, it starts getting a little bit spooky, man, when they're saying on Air America, I'm calling for killing cops, when I've never said that.
[01:04:30.649 --> 01:04:33.972]  Yeah, you've never said that, but again, they are getting nervous.
[01:04:34.052 --> 01:04:36.654]  We are finally having an effect to the point where
[01:04:37.233 --> 01:04:47.084]  They, in their ivory towers, are getting a little bit nervous because they know the natives are restless, and we are getting ready to take back our constitutional republic.
[01:04:49.366 --> 01:04:50.127]  Well, that's right.
[01:04:51.689 --> 01:04:52.870]  We're lawfully doing this.
[01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.634]  This is a criminal government, and what does the Declaration of Independence say about a criminal government?
[01:04:57.697 --> 01:04:59.377]  We can alter or abolish it.
[01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:01.718]  We've created it.
[01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:08.440]  We have individual rights and they have privileges that we grant them by way of Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.920]  And now they've got it backwards.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:13.921]  They tell us they grant us privileges and that they have rights.
[01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:16.742]  But that's ass-backwards, isn't it?
[01:05:17.688 --> 01:05:23.210]  It is passed backwards, and that is the focus of my Constitution class.
[01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:27.431]  My 8-hour class, Chapter 2, Rights vs. Privileges.
[01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:29.492]  We, the people, have individual rights.
[01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.693]  We give government privileges.
[01:05:32.533 --> 01:05:37.475]  And it's the very first words of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 1, Clause 1.
[01:05:38.457 --> 01:05:42.158]  All legislative powers herein granted.
[01:05:42.299 --> 01:05:47.921]  We grant them power, we can take that power away from them whenever we're courageous enough to do so.
[01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:51.382]  And in fact, it's not our right to do it, it's our duty.
[01:05:52.462 --> 01:05:54.923]  Our moral obligation, absolutely.
[01:05:55.383 --> 01:06:01.846]  If someone were attacking your child, I mean, you wouldn't stand there and go, well, come on, Tommy, lead with your left.
[01:06:02.911 --> 01:06:03.091]  He's
[01:06:11.523 --> 01:06:14.525]  It's just chilling what the government is doing these days.
[01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:23.071]  I'm sure that you've been talking about the Missouri report that has Ron Paul supporters listed as terrorists.
[01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:24.672]  Oh, we've been talking about it.
[01:06:25.052 --> 01:06:25.892]  Yeah, we broke it.
[01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:28.894]  Yeah, there was a young man going through St.
[01:06:28.934 --> 01:06:34.378]  Louis and he had, you know, a couple thousand dollars on him and they were giving him a hard time.
[01:06:35.018 --> 01:06:39.181]  This is, I mean, I don't know what could be more blatant
[01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:43.203]  I mean, when we say totalitarian police state, this is it!
[01:06:45.489 --> 01:07:00.618]  Well, now they're putting in all over the country body scanners that admittedly scan your naked body and put it in a database, and they want you to scan your children's naked bodies in a government database, which they then can biometrically track with cameras, because the camera then has your biometric algorithm.
[01:07:00.758 --> 01:07:02.840]  It's like getting your digital thumb printer retina scan.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.040]  It's a body scan, 360.
[01:07:04.461 --> 01:07:07.222]  I mean, what's next?
[01:07:07.282 --> 01:07:08.803]  It's already insanely bad.
[01:07:09.063 --> 01:07:13.706]  Now they admit, oh yeah, we've been taking all babies' blood at birth for a UN database for 36 years.
[01:07:14.867 --> 01:07:16.048]  You know, I got laughed at about that.
[01:07:16.108 --> 01:07:17.188]  Now it's in all the newspapers.
[01:07:17.649 --> 01:07:20.150]  They're now announcing they're Kim trailing us, Michael.
[01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.891]  They go, yeah, we're spraying you for your own good.
[01:07:23.151 --> 01:07:24.592]  We mix it with the jet fuel.
[01:07:25.433 --> 01:07:28.114]  I mean, that's in the Associated Press, Michael, today!
[01:07:30.295 --> 01:07:38.159]  I mean... I've been trying to bring people's attention to it, and my expertise is teaching people what they already know.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:43.182]  And when I teach my Constitution class, people walk out of there realizing
[01:07:43.823 --> 01:07:48.404]  Just how far away we have gotten from the principles our founding fathers left us.
[01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:52.685]  That's what I wake up to every day and freak out.
[01:07:52.765 --> 01:08:06.668]  How crazy it is, the fact that they'll admit they're setting up world government with a world currency, that they're spraying us in a secret program, that they're putting, I mean, I mean, what on earth does it take to get folks angry?
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:13.423]  I had a gentleman call me about three weeks ago and said, Michael, America's in trouble.
[01:08:13.944 --> 01:08:14.744]  And I said, yeah.
[01:08:14.764 --> 01:08:16.205]  And he says, no, we've got to do something.
[01:08:16.245 --> 01:08:17.386]  We've got to do something now.
[01:08:18.046 --> 01:08:23.289]  And I was glad to have him on our side, but I told him that he was not going to be leading the parade.
[01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:25.671]  That ship had already left the dock.
[01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:28.933]  So I told him which websites to look at.
[01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:37.698]  But it is finally so ridiculously crazy that your average person is
[01:08:38.487 --> 01:08:47.872]  He realizes that the government's out of control, all of this, the bailout and the stimulus package, all this information.
[01:08:49.173 --> 01:08:58.458]  I just brought a cab back from the airport a couple days ago, and I asked the cab driver how much of Barack Obama's stimulus package he was going to get.
[01:08:58.958 --> 01:09:00.419]  And he turned around and looked at me.
[01:09:00.459 --> 01:09:02.360]  I thought for a moment he was going to throw me out of the cab.
[01:09:05.492 --> 01:09:07.414]  So he was definitely angry at Lord Obama.
[01:09:07.454 --> 01:09:12.959]  We're already seeing a lot of real liberals, you know, who aren't foundation paid off by Soros or the others.
[01:09:13.619 --> 01:09:18.143]  Obama publicly is funding Acorn, saying they're going to disrupt Tea Parties nationwide.
[01:09:18.163 --> 01:09:24.589]  I mean, people are going to protest against higher taxes and Obama is going to dispatch his paid-for group?
[01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:27.531]  That he just gave a couple billion to out to disrupt it?
[01:09:27.912 --> 01:09:29.213]  I mean, this is getting insane!
[01:09:30.984 --> 01:09:32.945]  Well, that's exactly what Joseph Stalin did.
[01:09:33.326 --> 01:09:36.728]  You're not allowed to oppose the company line.
[01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:45.735]  The government says something that must be true, and anybody who disagrees is suspect of being, you know, a terrorist.
[01:09:45.795 --> 01:09:52.200]  And that, I wish I could say that was only a euphemism here in the United States, but that's getting to be literal.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.681]  And I'm with you.
[01:09:54.701 --> 01:09:56.703]  If this, if being a
[01:09:57.671 --> 01:10:04.594]  Enemy of the state means that you're opposed to the taxes, opposed to the unconstitutional government, and opposed to all of this police state.
[01:10:04.954 --> 01:10:08.295]  Well, I'm happy to mark shoulder-to-shoulder with you.
[01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:09.796]  Exactly.
[01:10:09.816 --> 01:10:12.957]  At this point, we're going, please stop, just like the Founders did for a decade.
[01:10:13.297 --> 01:10:13.897]  Please stop.
[01:10:14.238 --> 01:10:14.898]  Please stop.
[01:10:15.538 --> 01:10:17.859]  And we're going, this isn't going to go nice for you or us.
[01:10:18.239 --> 01:10:19.900]  This is going to be mutually destructive.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.420]  You need to stop.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.261]  And the government just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:10:24.281 --> 01:10:26.042]  They're all isolated in their ivory towers.
[01:10:26.062 --> 01:10:27.682]  But let me tell you who's not isolated.
[01:10:27.703 --> 01:10:28.763]  It's all their enforcers.
[01:10:29.483 --> 01:10:34.145]  And we're now reaching out to their enforcers, and their enforcers are reaching out to us going, yeah, we don't like this either.
[01:10:34.165 --> 01:10:39.887]  Because they're not all bad, and they're made up of the general public, and I don't... Michael, I gotta tell you.
[01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:41.766]  And I'll tell it like it is.
[01:10:41.806 --> 01:10:43.527]  I've really looked at this through a historical lens.
[01:10:44.248 --> 01:10:45.849]  I think the New World Order is going to fall.
[01:10:45.929 --> 01:10:46.870]  I don't think it's going to make it.
[01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:55.816]  Our biggest problem, once you speak to that, is that the phony Christian churches have been paid off by the World Council of Churches to tell their flocks it's the end of the world and to lay down.
[01:10:56.197 --> 01:11:02.181]  So fake Christian dogma, telling folks it's the end of the world, is the only thing keeping us from beating them.
[01:11:02.442 --> 01:11:06.665]  Because then that takes your mainline conservative base and they just sit there on their thumbs.
[01:11:08.735 --> 01:11:09.415]  Well, it is.
[01:11:09.495 --> 01:11:11.796]  The New World Order is going to fall.
[01:11:12.296 --> 01:11:13.596]  That's for sure.
[01:11:13.656 --> 01:11:20.638]  Just like the sun comes up every morning, just like young people discover love, we're going to restore our constitutional republic.
[01:11:21.038 --> 01:11:26.259]  It's definitely going to get messy between now and then, because we've been asking them to stop.
[01:11:26.399 --> 01:11:28.200]  The government is going to use force.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.301]  And Thomas Jefferson said the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed.
[01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:35.288]  With the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:11:35.428 --> 01:11:41.111]  And I'm convinced that Thomas Jefferson put patriots first because we won't pull the trigger first.
[01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:42.832]  The government will pull the trigger.
[01:11:42.912 --> 01:11:43.752]  They will kill us.
[01:11:44.152 --> 01:11:48.174]  There's going to be another event, possibly like Waco or something like that.
[01:11:48.635 --> 01:11:50.575]  And the American public is going to retaliate.
[01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:56.898]  And like you, I am doing everything I can to stop bloodshed, to stop violence.
[01:11:57.419 --> 01:11:59.920]  And I tell people that the revolution will happen.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:04.002]  The only variable is how many people are on our side.
[01:12:04.022 --> 01:12:08.403]  If we can get the people to wake up, we can do a peaceful, bloodless revolution.
[01:12:14.522 --> 01:12:17.863]  But we've already exposed false flag terror, so that tool doesn't work anymore.
[01:12:17.883 --> 01:12:18.804]  Let's talk about that.
[01:12:18.824 --> 01:12:20.285]  Let's talk about strategy with Michael McNair.
[01:12:20.305 --> 01:12:22.125]  I've got more chemtrail news coming up.
[01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:27.448]  I won't have time to debunk Glenn Beck, but I'm going to do it tonight with Burmess.
[01:12:27.848 --> 01:12:29.248]  There's a new Glenn Beck hit piece.
[01:12:29.288 --> 01:12:30.269]  It's worse than the last.
[01:12:31.624 --> 01:12:33.985]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[01:12:34.365 --> 01:12:38.367]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[01:12:38.807 --> 01:12:42.709]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:45.030]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:49.752]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[01:12:50.092 --> 01:12:56.395]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[01:12:56.995 --> 01:12:58.196]  One Florida customer says,
[01:12:58.656 --> 01:13:06.724]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery.
[01:13:07.265 --> 01:13:11.409]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.812]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[01:13:15.272 --> 01:13:17.154]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com.
[01:13:17.515 --> 01:13:19.256]  That's 9voltlite.com or call
[01:13:20.077 --> 01:13:21.538]  Call us today toll free at 877-715-4448.
[01:13:21.638 --> 01:13:21.938]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:25.041]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:37.399 --> 01:13:42.762]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:43.282 --> 01:13:49.485]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:49.785 --> 01:13:51.586]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:51.746 --> 01:13:54.147]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:54.208 --> 01:14:04.953]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:14:07.404 --> 01:14:08.685]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:09.065 --> 01:14:10.465]  It's about a one world government.
[01:14:10.925 --> 01:14:17.248]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:14:26.091 --> 01:14:27.231]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.852]  The people strike back.
[01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:33.763]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:14:34.164 --> 01:14:40.730]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:45.474]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:55.563]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:14:55.990 --> 01:15:05.701]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years, compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:15:06.062 --> 01:15:07.844]  Call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237, extension 115.
[01:15:11.668 --> 01:15:12.128]  We're good.
[01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:37.401]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:41.924]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[01:16:33.482 --> 01:16:36.024]  We just got a Virginia fusion center.
[01:16:36.064 --> 01:16:38.706]  That's a federalization FEMA takeover of the government.
[01:16:38.726 --> 01:16:40.748]  When you hear fusion center, that's what it is.
[01:16:41.228 --> 01:16:43.470]  It's a fusion center that put out the MIAC report we broke.
[01:16:44.371 --> 01:16:50.536]  Infowars.com is now breaking worldwide a 200 plus page internal fusion center document.
[01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:55.553]  And you want to read, we've been reading over this last hour, it is unbelievable.
[01:16:57.494 --> 01:16:59.415]  Nightmare after nightmare of demonization.
[01:16:59.455 --> 01:17:03.758]  You thought MIAC was bad, this is breaking right now at Infowars.com.
[01:17:03.838 --> 01:17:06.840]  Huge news breaking at PrisonPlanet.com, it's sister site.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.681]  Twin Titan in the Infowar.
[01:17:09.301 --> 01:17:11.503]  I just love, I love fighting the globalists.
[01:17:12.183 --> 01:17:15.265]  It feels so good to fight scumbag parasite tyranny.
[01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:19.748]  And to see them being routed over and over again when good people just take the field.
[01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:24.386]  I'm going to have Burma's coming in in about 10 minutes to quit popping with some of the nightmares that are in this.
[01:17:24.826 --> 01:17:26.548]  He's been scanning over it the last 30 minutes.
[01:17:26.568 --> 01:17:30.150]  200-something pages, you know, our reading assignment.
[01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:37.895]  Imagine having homework that never ends, that you have a passion for, because you want knowledge and to beat them.
[01:17:38.215 --> 01:17:39.256]  It's like you can't stop.
[01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:40.637]  You can't stop researching.
[01:17:40.677 --> 01:17:41.678]  You can't stop learning.
[01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:45.961]  You can't stop finding out what's disinfo and what's real.
[01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:47.882]  What has this journey been like for you?
[01:17:47.902 --> 01:17:50.824]  Because, you know, you sprouted out of Austin as well as a lot of folks.
[01:17:51.904 --> 01:17:55.846]  Yeah, well it's been, well it certainly hasn't been boring.
[01:17:56.647 --> 01:18:13.055]  I've been on the road, well since 2003, two years on the presidential campaign, two years for the congressional campaign, and ever since the presidential election, interest in my Constitution class has been skyrocketing.
[01:18:13.135 --> 01:18:17.818]  People are finally deciding that they need to learn a little bit about the Constitution.
[01:18:18.662 --> 01:18:21.104]  And I've got a special deal for your listeners.
[01:18:21.424 --> 01:18:26.588]  I'll be teaching my Constitution class in Philadelphia on Sunday, April 26th.
[01:18:26.628 --> 01:18:32.732]  They're having an end-the-Fed rally in Philadelphia on Saturday.
[01:18:33.573 --> 01:18:39.037]  My class will be on Sunday, and I'm offering your listeners a $15 discount.
[01:18:39.117 --> 01:18:40.077]  Normally it's $100.
[01:18:40.558 --> 01:18:47.963]  They can take the class for $85, and all they have to do is type in, uh, Long Live the Republic.
[01:18:48.413 --> 01:18:54.997]  There's a button, a PayPal button on my website, constitutionpreservation.org.
[01:18:56.038 --> 01:19:11.709]  That's right, and nobody teaches it like you do, because I've done a lot of research on it, and your analysis and the way you present it is just stunning, and also very charismatic, and don't you have a film as well with a presentation, very well done, going over, you know, what's happening?
[01:19:12.889 --> 01:19:16.692]  Well, the original class that I taught is on the internet,
[01:19:17.308 --> 01:19:23.517]  It was... I actually taught that class in Houston, Texas on September 9th, 2001.
[01:19:23.557 --> 01:19:28.244]  I mean, clearly I had no idea that anything was going to happen in New York.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:33.684]  But that's been posted all over the internet, probably 30 or 40 different sites by now.
[01:19:34.025 --> 01:19:35.106]  Yeah, millions of views.
[01:19:35.806 --> 01:19:39.169]  Yeah, I have a 12-hour version.
[01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:40.230]  It's a little bit prettier.
[01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:43.873]  I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and we sell my book with that.
[01:19:44.394 --> 01:19:49.518]  So that's all available on the homepage at constitutionpreservation.org.
[01:19:49.898 --> 01:19:50.359]  Alright, good.
[01:19:50.379 --> 01:19:51.260]  Folks, you should check that out.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.442]  Now, government-sponsored terror.
[01:19:54.428 --> 01:19:57.371]  You know, they caught the Denver Police staging attacks on police last year.
[01:19:57.411 --> 01:19:58.773]  Denver Post, the police admit it.
[01:19:59.053 --> 01:19:59.834]  We catch them all the time.
[01:19:59.854 --> 01:20:00.955]  That's a form of false flag.
[01:20:00.975 --> 01:20:04.259]  It's where you do something bad for those who don't know and blame it on your political enemies.
[01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:07.743]  Clearly, Ivan, I want to see if you disagree or agree.
[01:20:07.943 --> 01:20:11.587]  Obama is... his agenda is dying.
[01:20:11.647 --> 01:20:13.710]  The hype is wearing off even quicker than we had hoped.
[01:20:14.662 --> 01:20:15.962]  But then that goes into phase two.
[01:20:16.002 --> 01:20:16.963]  They're going to stage terror.
[01:20:17.243 --> 01:20:18.123]  Maybe even a big war.
[01:20:18.163 --> 01:20:19.523]  Iran Corporation says they want that.
[01:20:20.104 --> 01:20:21.324]  Israel's saying they may hit Iran.
[01:20:21.664 --> 01:20:22.804]  They may release bird flu.
[01:20:23.324 --> 01:20:26.225]  We've confirmed with government documents they are building mass graves everywhere.
[01:20:26.285 --> 01:20:27.046]  The story's confirmed.
[01:20:28.586 --> 01:20:31.167]  They've got to have a mass crisis to get this going.
[01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:34.348]  It couldn't be start rioting or kill a bunch of cops and say we did it.
[01:20:34.808 --> 01:20:36.128]  That's in Operation Northwoods.
[01:20:37.368 --> 01:20:38.349]  What do you see happening?
[01:20:38.369 --> 01:20:42.550]  Because they're not going to get their agenda through without staging some big events.
[01:20:44.529 --> 01:20:47.771]  You know, they've got so many options.
[01:20:48.131 --> 01:20:52.053]  I really don't know what they are planning to do.
[01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:54.835]  Any of those things make me suspicious.
[01:20:56.116 --> 01:21:05.181]  You know, any large disaster, you know, I'm automatically trying to imagine if that would be, you know, an act of God or an act of an insane government.
[01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.542]  But you're absolutely correct.
[01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:12.265]  They're going to... Well, the economy's already crashing.
[01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:13.426]  We're kind of in the middle of that.
[01:21:14.148 --> 01:21:15.568]  Food is going to become scarce.
[01:21:15.688 --> 01:21:20.850]  People are going to be running through the neighborhood looking for their neighbor's last jar of peanut butter.
[01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:26.031]  And we are going to have what they gently call civil unrest.
[01:21:26.071 --> 01:21:27.591]  Well, that's rioting in the street.
[01:21:28.612 --> 01:21:33.713]  And that's all the excuse they're going to need to bring in their troops, all of the
[01:21:34.603 --> 01:21:35.084]  I don't
[01:21:48.067 --> 01:21:54.172]  I just know that it's probably going to, and I've got all the people that listen to me ready for it.
[01:21:54.432 --> 01:22:08.903]  We're storing food, we've converted our paper money to silver and gold, and I went to Walmart personally looking for ammunition, and the woman told me that they get a shipment every three or four days.
[01:22:09.384 --> 01:22:13.327]  They don't put it on the shelf, they put it on a cart, and it's gone in two hours.
[01:22:17.108 --> 01:22:17.949]  Oh boy, folks.
[01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:19.669]  People deep down know what's coming.
[01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:22.071]  We're on the march.
[01:22:22.511 --> 01:22:24.072]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:24.092 --> 01:22:27.834]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:31.076 --> 01:22:32.256]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[01:22:32.436 --> 01:22:34.718]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:22:34.858 --> 01:22:38.880]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.061]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[01:22:45.589 --> 01:22:46.169]  For the rest of you?
[01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.332]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:19.372 --> 01:23:24.434]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:23:44.705 --> 01:23:50.867]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:51.267 --> 01:23:53.107]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:53.247 --> 01:23:55.668]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:55.748 --> 01:24:06.691]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:24:07.331 --> 01:24:08.611]  It's not about left or right.
[01:24:09.012 --> 01:24:10.372]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:24:10.862 --> 01:24:17.208]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:24:26.035 --> 01:24:27.176]  The Obama Deception.
[01:24:27.617 --> 01:24:28.798]  The people strike back.
[01:24:31.044 --> 01:24:34.427]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:24:34.567 --> 01:24:39.772]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:24:39.972 --> 01:24:44.657]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:56.285]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:24:56.645 --> 01:25:02.189]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:08.474]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:25:08.674 --> 01:25:09.334]  What about you?
[01:25:09.715 --> 01:25:13.417]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[01:26:07.259 --> 01:26:07.800]  I just love it.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:08.700]  I love life.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.524]  You know, all this terrible stuff's happening and it would be horrible if I wasn't fighting it.
[01:26:12.924 --> 01:26:14.846]  But at least I know the truth and I'm fighting them.
[01:26:15.546 --> 01:26:17.708]  And whatever happens, I know I was on the side of good.
[01:26:18.589 --> 01:26:19.550]  I know I told the truth.
[01:26:20.171 --> 01:26:21.151]  I know I was for real.
[01:26:22.253 --> 01:26:25.234]  And the enemy, they're phonies, they're fakes, they have no honor.
[01:26:25.274 --> 01:26:29.696]  That's why they try to pull us down and badmouth us and lie about us from all angles.
[01:26:30.156 --> 01:26:39.419]  Because they know in all this darkness and all these lies, those of you out there that stand up for truth and justice and honesty, that you shine like a white light and they just can't stand it.
[01:26:39.979 --> 01:26:42.120]  So they try to pull us down and say we're not for real.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:42.760]  We're for real.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.060]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:45.301]  And look at the fruits.
[01:26:46.141 --> 01:26:51.334]  The awakening that's happening through this radio show and my films alone and now other people becoming leaders.
[01:26:51.354 --> 01:26:54.422]  We're going back to Michael Bagner in just a moment, but I wanted to bring up Gary King.
[01:26:55.578 --> 01:26:58.979]  Gary King heard me say get a radio show years ago.
[01:26:59.679 --> 01:27:03.580]  And then I guess he made a pilgrimage or something to our office one day, sat outside, went out and talked to him.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.061]  Unfortunately, I had like 50 people doing that a day, so I had to move offices.
[01:27:07.081 --> 01:27:12.082]  But I did meet with him, hung out with him, had a cup of coffee with him, and said, yeah, keep doing your radio show, great job.
[01:27:12.142 --> 01:27:14.923]  And since then, about a year ago, it's just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:27:15.383 --> 01:27:17.183]  And so I wanted him to briefly give you a testimony.
[01:27:17.504 --> 01:27:22.845]  He's on 990 AM out of New Orleans, and to tell you about his show and how popular it's gotten.
[01:27:23.425 --> 01:27:24.667]  And this is what you can do.
[01:27:24.707 --> 01:27:25.989]  And he had to pay for it at first.
[01:27:26.029 --> 01:27:27.611]  Now he has sponsors and it pays for itself.
[01:27:28.111 --> 01:27:29.734]  But that's how you get your break.
[01:27:30.515 --> 01:27:31.416]  And don't wait.
[01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:32.017]  Just do it.
[01:27:32.277 --> 01:27:34.380]  Briefly, because I don't want to cut into McNairick's time here.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.904]  Michael McNairick, Gary King, tell folks about what's happened with you.
[01:27:39.441 --> 01:27:42.842]  Well, just like I heard you say one time, you said, look, get your own radio show.
[01:27:42.862 --> 01:27:43.962]  It doesn't cost that much.
[01:27:44.362 --> 01:27:48.844]  So I did that and I'm going to tell everyone else who has a little talent and feel they can do it.
[01:27:49.144 --> 01:27:50.344]  And my show is pre-recorded.
[01:27:50.404 --> 01:27:53.045]  So when I stutter and stumble, I just go back and redo it.
[01:27:53.565 --> 01:28:03.127]  So just, you know, get off your booty and get your own radio show, because we're breaking news all the time because Alex isn't on in New Orleans.
[01:28:03.147 --> 01:28:04.588]  So I went ahead and got my own show.
[01:28:04.668 --> 01:28:05.748]  I plug him all the time.
[01:28:05.768 --> 01:28:06.148]  You know what?
[01:28:06.228 --> 01:28:07.189]  I'm going to make a t-shirt.
[01:28:07.209 --> 01:28:08.209]  I'm going to make a t-shirt.
[01:28:08.849 --> 01:28:09.849]  Get off your booty!
[01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:11.410]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:14.451]  There you go.
[01:28:14.471 --> 01:28:19.053]  So just go ahead and get your own show, and you can make it happen like that.
[01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:20.334]  We cover 9-11.
[01:28:20.674 --> 01:28:22.655]  I'm really doing some Katrina research.
[01:28:23.355 --> 01:28:31.378]  New Orleans has really paid a hard price from New World Order, and we're gonna bring evidence about FEMA blowing the levees really soon.
[01:28:31.779 --> 01:28:34.380]  Oh, they did that before, so that's confirmed.
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.421]  Now, plug what time your show's on, 9-90.
[01:28:37.665 --> 01:29:00.044]  Okay if you don't want to catch the podcast at any time but you go to WGSO 990 AM now the live shows from 4 to 5 on Wednesdays but just go to the website and then hit podcast and then it'll say Patriot Radio and then my last four shows are on there and I'm a musician and I'm a Cajun guitar playing Cajun from cutoff and um
[01:29:00.842 --> 01:29:08.848]  Just go there and listen to him because I'm a musician and I put music, there's music playing all the time and it always has to do with the topic that's related.
[01:29:08.948 --> 01:29:10.009]  Alright, good job.
[01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.890]  Everybody do it.
[01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:11.670]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:12.411]  You bet.
[01:29:12.671 --> 01:29:13.171]  Absolutely.
[01:29:13.211 --> 01:29:14.472]  We love the Coonasses.
[01:29:14.512 --> 01:29:15.273]  They are great people.
[01:29:15.293 --> 01:29:16.173]  That's what they call themselves.
[01:29:16.654 --> 01:29:18.175]  I've got some family that are Coonasses.
[01:29:18.655 --> 01:29:21.077]  Alright, there's people in the office that are Coonasses.
[01:29:21.497 --> 01:29:23.099]  Anyways, that's the term, folks.
[01:29:23.119 --> 01:29:24.600]  You can say ass, it means a donkey.
[01:29:25.841 --> 01:29:28.142]  Great folks down there and we appreciate them coming on the show.
[01:29:28.523 --> 01:29:29.964]  Okay, going back to Michael Bagneri.
[01:29:30.984 --> 01:29:36.365]  Michael, continuing with what you were going over, this is all coming to a head.
[01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:37.365]  I mean, this is it.
[01:29:37.426 --> 01:29:40.966]  This is the time in history, and they've openly announced world government.
[01:29:41.426 --> 01:29:54.089]  How ridiculous is it, though, what do you call this double think or double speak, where they announce there's a world government, a world currency run by banks, exactly what we said it would be, but that it doesn't exist at the same time when we criticize it, and we're crazy?
[01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.472]  In 1984, they called it doublespeak.
[01:30:01.932 --> 01:30:06.273]  You know, war is peace, you know, weakness is strength.
[01:30:06.493 --> 01:30:07.734]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:30:08.174 --> 01:30:13.355]  I never thought, when I was reading that book in high school, that we would come this close to it.
[01:30:14.256 --> 01:30:21.198]  But I never thought that we'd have a Patriot Act, a Military Commissions Act, a Homegrown Terrorism Act.
[01:30:21.818 --> 01:30:25.619]  If you told me ten years ago, Alex, that those documents would exist,
[01:30:26.184 --> 01:30:27.184]  I disagreed with it.
[01:30:27.304 --> 01:30:31.486]  You know, Alex, you're a great guy, but the American people would never let it get that bad.
[01:30:32.146 --> 01:30:33.247]  Well, we have.
[01:30:33.647 --> 01:30:39.950]  And people are finally, finally starting to realize just how far out of control it is.
[01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:45.692]  The problem is that they've waited so long, now they're starting to feel like it's hopeless.
[01:30:46.072 --> 01:30:47.373]  But that is not true.
[01:30:47.453 --> 01:30:49.433]  We are having an effect.
[01:30:49.814 --> 01:30:55.736]  Your presence in the radio and in your videos has had a tremendous effect.
[01:30:56.883 --> 01:31:01.484]  My mother has watched your videos and passed them out to friends of hers.
[01:31:01.704 --> 01:31:02.004]  Oh, good.
[01:31:02.084 --> 01:31:07.266]  So, yeah, I mean, we really are having a huge movement right now.
[01:31:07.366 --> 01:31:17.388]  People are, you know, coming over, you know, to realize that, you know, the government has been lying to us, spending us into oblivion.
[01:31:18.977 --> 01:31:24.839]  And, you know, those of us who have been here, we've just got to give the new people a little bit of time to get their balance.
[01:31:25.259 --> 01:31:28.460]  Because we have taken a long time to learn this.
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.760]  It's kind of obvious to us.
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:38.062]  But for these new people, it is such a shock to their system to realize just how far the deception has gone.
[01:31:38.142 --> 01:31:40.683]  Well, think of the magnitude that we've known.
[01:31:41.883 --> 01:31:43.585]  Those aren't ice crystal trails.
[01:31:43.645 --> 01:31:44.786]  They're staying there for hours.
[01:31:44.806 --> 01:31:46.748]  They're turning into clouds.
[01:31:46.929 --> 01:31:49.532]  That plane isn't spraying it, but that one right by it is.
[01:31:49.932 --> 01:31:52.014]  And now the president just goes, yeah, we're spraying you.
[01:31:52.034 --> 01:31:53.196]  It's for your own good.
[01:31:53.296 --> 01:31:54.117]  It's classified.
[01:31:55.678 --> 01:31:58.221]  It's classified, you know, and for our own good.
[01:31:58.822 --> 01:32:01.004]  I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them.
[01:32:14.378 --> 01:32:16.520]  I start wondering what other crazy stuff may be true.
[01:32:17.081 --> 01:32:18.823]  Because I've always known something's wrong.
[01:32:18.863 --> 01:32:20.965]  My whole life I grew up and trails weren't like that.
[01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:23.608]  And I grew up, you know, near an airport by Dallas.
[01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:27.512]  And suddenly, you know, but you always kind of had a nagging thing.
[01:32:27.552 --> 01:32:30.475]  Well, the government admits some of it, but maybe I'm just, maybe I am.
[01:32:30.515 --> 01:32:32.517]  And then the president comes out and goes, yeah, we're spraying you.
[01:32:32.537 --> 01:32:34.339]  You know, I mean, you want to believe.
[01:32:34.399 --> 01:32:36.762]  I mean, Mike, do you ever want to believe this stuff isn't real?
[01:32:38.201 --> 01:32:43.142]  Yes, because if it is real, then we are in so much trouble.
[01:32:43.482 --> 01:32:46.403]  And I think that's where most people get their denial.
[01:32:46.883 --> 01:32:51.023]  It's like, Alex, no way that they can have all these concentration camps.
[01:32:51.103 --> 01:32:52.844]  No way they're digging graves.
[01:32:53.044 --> 01:32:57.785]  And if that's true, you know, we are really in deep, deep, serious trouble.
[01:32:57.825 --> 01:33:02.546]  And I might have to get, you know, turn off the wheel of fortune and start to do something about it.
[01:33:03.066 --> 01:33:04.826]  But over the years,
[01:33:05.876 --> 01:33:08.257]  I've watched people across the country.
[01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:15.199]  My presidential campaign allowed me to travel to all 48 of the lower, you know, extremist states.
[01:33:15.779 --> 01:33:21.881]  And people are all over in Oregon and Washington and California, everywhere.
[01:33:21.921 --> 01:33:25.242]  They've got groups who are just as passionate as you and I are.
[01:33:25.502 --> 01:33:26.563]  They're doing good work.
[01:33:26.703 --> 01:33:27.163]  And then they go,
[01:33:27.683 --> 01:33:30.184]  We're the only ones fighting for liberty.
[01:33:30.364 --> 01:33:31.965]  It's like, are you crazy?
[01:33:32.285 --> 01:33:35.267]  No, no, because they're all compartmentalized.
[01:33:35.287 --> 01:33:37.248]  Let me make a point, and I want your take on this.
[01:33:37.268 --> 01:33:42.690]  The Burmese is going to come in with some breaking news on a new gigantic fusion center secret report we just got in our little hands.
[01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.852]  Mass graves, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:58.819]  Glenn Beck's now saying he's going to debunk mass graves, because he's a patriot, and we can trust him, and then he's going to stab us all in the back and go show the few straw men FEMA camps that weren't real, that I predicted he would show.
[01:33:59.439 --> 01:34:08.106]  Well, now with the mass graves, he's going to go out and show the few cases that were wrong, because everybody's looking into this now, and people are becoming citizen journalists, they're going to get it wrong.
[01:34:08.466 --> 01:34:12.750]  I haven't seen any fake cases yet, so I don't know what he's going to pick, but he'll find one.
[01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:16.433]  He's now announced that on the radio yesterday, I'm told, by a good source.
[01:34:16.473 --> 01:34:18.234]  But Mass Graves.
[01:34:18.895 --> 01:34:20.756]  Now, here is the Rocky Mountain News.
[01:34:20.816 --> 01:34:21.697]  Now, I remembered this.
[01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.419]  Plugged it on air and people found it.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.401]  InsideDenver.com.
[01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:30.104]  This was by Jim Erickson, Rocky Mountain News, February 8, 2003.
[01:34:30.845 --> 01:34:32.646]  Rocky Mountain News exists.
[01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:34.591]  Jim Erickson exists.
[01:34:35.071 --> 01:34:40.536]  I was mailed the actual newspaper by a listener when this happened in 2003 and then I googled it and found it.
[01:34:40.996 --> 01:34:45.760]  So somewhere around here, stuff piles up, we have the Rocky... Denver exists.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:47.701]  Rocky Mountain News exists.
[01:34:47.821 --> 01:34:49.062]  Colorado exists.
[01:34:49.503 --> 01:34:50.644]  It's in the Rocky Mountains.
[01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:52.205]  People deny all this, so let me explain.
[01:34:53.426 --> 01:34:55.968]  Mike Bagnerek, there is a place called Colorado, right?
[01:34:57.117 --> 01:34:58.939]  Absolutely, I've been there and campaigned there.
[01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:04.125]  Okay, we promise you folks, I know Glenn Beck will say it in real, and I'm not even being satirical now.
[01:35:04.806 --> 01:35:08.470]  Okay, Colorado exists, the Rocky Mountain News is a major paper, correct?
[01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:10.332]  Yes.
[01:35:10.852 --> 01:35:16.238]  Okay, now this says incinerators and mass graves, okay?
[01:35:17.555 --> 01:35:18.916]  And this is 2003!
[01:35:19.637 --> 01:35:28.326]  The state of Colorado could seize antibiotics, cremate disease-ridden corpses, and under extreme circumstances dig mass graves under executive orders drafted for the use in the event of bioterrorism.
[01:35:28.566 --> 01:35:36.474]  Then they had public training for years, getting ready for forced inoculations, mass graves, and then we got from the state of New York, where they're telling all the
[01:35:37.813 --> 01:35:44.136]  And doing surveys to bury, what, 900 and something bodies per acre, where they can bury the bodies for a flu outbreak.
[01:35:44.396 --> 01:35:50.698]  We put these documents on air, and we've got all these other mainstream news stories, but then the news says we're liars.
[01:35:51.058 --> 01:35:52.459]  None of this exists, Mike.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:07.405]  Well, if disinformation, if they can contradict, if the average person hears you and I talking about mass graves, and then they read another report that says, no, there are no mass graves, it's a, it's a fallacy.
[01:36:08.828 --> 01:36:13.309]  The answer they want to believe, they want to believe that there are no mass graves.
[01:36:13.369 --> 01:36:22.391]  And so, you know, the person without any more information than that is going to, you know, lean in the direction of, oh, you know, Michael and Alex, they're just exaggerating.
[01:36:22.411 --> 01:36:23.151]  They're on the radio.
[01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:25.231]  They're trying to create names for themselves.
[01:36:25.752 --> 01:36:28.252]  When, I mean, all this stuff is true.
[01:36:28.872 --> 01:36:29.492]  Absolutely.
[01:36:29.532 --> 01:36:37.054]  You were reporting on black helicopters down at the Gulf Coast of Texas, and I happen to have a friend living there.
[01:36:38.951 --> 01:36:41.172]  I called and I said, you know, I just heard a report.
[01:36:41.532 --> 01:36:42.933]  And she goes, yeah, I saw those.
[01:36:42.993 --> 01:36:44.253]  I wondered what they were doing.
[01:36:44.733 --> 01:36:51.416]  And so I had, you know, like secondhand confirmation, somebody who had seen those black helicopters down in South Texas personally.
[01:36:52.436 --> 01:36:54.297]  So this stuff does happen.
[01:36:54.337 --> 01:36:55.217]  It is happening.
[01:36:55.637 --> 01:37:00.759]  I mean, we don't have to invent a trillion dollar bailout.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.501]  And let me just give a quick analysis for your listeners.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:05.921]  One inch.
[01:37:06.301 --> 01:37:07.501]  Little tiny one inch.
[01:37:07.541 --> 01:37:09.463]  You put 12 of them together, you get a foot.
[01:37:10.023 --> 01:37:15.546]  You put a million of them together, that's 15.7 miles.
[01:37:16.086 --> 01:37:22.130]  A billion is 15,700 miles, which is a little more than halfway around the world.
[01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:26.552]  A trillion inches is 633 laps around the equator.
[01:37:26.572 --> 01:37:26.732]  That
[01:37:30.986 --> 01:37:39.270]  A lot of interest, and Barack Obama is just casually throwing a trillion of your dollars here, a trillion of your dollars there.
[01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:53.196]  But even better, 12.8 trillion in the last six months, that's 200 million short of the GDP, so 12.8 trillion, so in a year it'll be 26 trillion by that math, or to be technical, 25.6 trillion.
[01:37:53.216 --> 01:37:58.839]  25.6 trillion in one year, and they're saying they're expanding it.
[01:37:59.778 --> 01:38:06.142]  That's double the GDP of the country, and then he has the nerve to say, I'm going to balance the budget in one year.
[01:38:06.783 --> 01:38:13.967]  When Bush tripled the size of government in eight years, Obama is doubling that in the first year, Mike.
[01:38:14.508 --> 01:38:16.509]  I mean, this is just, it's all over.
[01:38:16.569 --> 01:38:18.130]  Go ahead.
[01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:24.274]  I don't think that we could physically put $12 trillion on an aircraft carrier.
[01:38:25.587 --> 01:38:31.329]  I think the aircraft carrier would sink with 12 trillion paper dollars on it.
[01:38:31.349 --> 01:38:40.033]  We'd have to do the calculations to see that, but I mean, just to give your listeners some understanding of, I mean, this boggles the imagination.
[01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:48.676]  And as if you can call anything with 12 zeros left of the decimal point a budget.
[01:38:49.201 --> 01:38:50.362]  Mike, this is too important.
[01:38:50.782 --> 01:38:52.282]  We're going to do overdrive today, man.
[01:38:52.783 --> 01:38:54.123]  So stand by for overdrive.
[01:38:54.163 --> 01:38:57.584]  Mike, I'll have to call you back on your line in 15 minutes on our studio.
[01:38:57.945 --> 01:39:03.967]  Let's do 20 minutes of overdrive, so we have time to take all these calls that never got a chance to get on air.
[01:39:03.987 --> 01:39:05.108]  So get me the studio number.
[01:39:05.128 --> 01:39:09.810]  I'm going to give that out, and we're going to get back in there in 20 minutes over, because Jason Burnis, breaking news.
[01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:10.510]  Come on down.
[01:39:11.923 --> 01:39:15.845]  And that means we're going to continue on at InfoWars.com, The Screams, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:16.286 --> 01:39:19.868]  Twenty minutes in the next hour with Michael Bagnerik and the breaking chemtrail news.
[01:39:19.948 --> 01:39:21.369]  I mean, this is all off the charts.
[01:39:21.849 --> 01:39:27.733]  And again, we had government documents a year ago where they finally admitted, yes, we're manipulating the atmosphere for your own good.
[01:39:28.253 --> 01:39:31.775]  But we won't say what we're doing, but we already reverse engineered it and know what they're doing.
[01:39:32.716 --> 01:39:33.556]  At least one of the programs.
[01:39:33.836 --> 01:39:36.898]  But I mean, to have AP admitting this, this is a day long remembered.
[01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:41.281]  I mean, you know, and then the attacks that are happening right now,
[01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:56.034]  It gives me, actually, a great feeling of satisfaction because it means we are just... I mean, you don't want to admit to yourself that your operation and what you've built is literally part of history now, and it's also scary.
[01:39:56.515 --> 01:39:59.998]  I mean, because it's just getting...
[01:40:00.851 --> 01:40:03.973]  You know, I've always tried to not make it about me, because Michael, you're a smart guy.
[01:40:04.353 --> 01:40:06.295]  You know that that means it makes you a target.
[01:40:06.555 --> 01:40:16.661]  It's also not good for the movement overall, because you want to have lots of leaders, and we do have that now, but they're trying to make me the leader so they can crush me and then think that'll decapitate things.
[01:40:16.721 --> 01:40:17.342]  It's not going to work.
[01:40:17.782 --> 01:40:18.623]  But it's kind of a...
[01:40:19.483 --> 01:40:19.784]  I don't know.
[01:40:19.804 --> 01:40:20.725]  I just grew up as a kid.
[01:40:20.745 --> 01:40:21.786]  I never thought I'd be in this position.
[01:40:22.067 --> 01:40:24.370]  Jason, you've got major breaking news.
[01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:27.254]  Major breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:27.274 --> 01:40:30.078]  Curt Nemo has got it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:40:30.098 --> 01:40:32.061]  We broke the MIAC report and now we've got this.
[01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:36.527]  Yeah, this is the 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment Report.
[01:40:36.747 --> 01:40:37.127]  I don't
[01:40:52.116 --> 01:40:57.357]  You know, they try to say, oh, it's an international terrorism threat, and then the usual suspects, the Arabs, right?
[01:40:57.818 --> 01:41:01.098]  Then it just goes into every other facet of life.
[01:41:01.499 --> 01:41:03.519]  Every group is an extremist group.
[01:41:03.759 --> 01:41:09.321]  They're using colleges, correctional facilities, the internet to recruit people, and they're all terrorists.
[01:41:09.561 --> 01:41:19.683]  Look, here are some of the, I haven't even gotten this far because this is page 60, lone wolf extremists, militia extremists, special interest extremism.
[01:41:19.844 --> 01:41:21.424]  Now, if you're part of a special interest group,
[01:41:21.604 --> 01:41:22.425]  You're also a terrorist.
[01:41:22.445 --> 01:41:27.749]  Well, they have state police under Homeland Security Federalization spying on bike rights groups that want bike lanes.
[01:41:28.329 --> 01:41:30.591]  Spying on groups that don't want landfills.
[01:41:31.471 --> 01:41:33.593]  As terrorists, and they list, this is in the news.
[01:41:34.253 --> 01:41:38.497]  So, we're going to continue after the break with this, and we're going to over to Michael Bagnerik.
[01:41:38.937 --> 01:41:39.978]  This is desperation.
[01:41:39.998 --> 01:41:47.703]  They're trying to demonize and create a chilling effect because they know we are waking the people up and that freedom is becoming the majority paradigm.
[01:41:50.566 --> 01:41:51.086]  Correct, Michael?
[01:41:52.295 --> 01:41:56.618]  Absolutely, I agree, and I will hang with you as long as you're willing to keep me on the air.
[01:41:56.778 --> 01:41:57.118]  I'm here.
[01:41:57.458 --> 01:42:04.382]  Okay, give us your take, though, on the fact that they're trying to demonize patriots with these Mayak-type reports, and now this Virginia Fusion Center report.
[01:42:05.363 --> 01:42:06.204]  Well, of course.
[01:42:06.304 --> 01:42:10.006]  I mean, that's what Adolf Hitler did to demonize the Jews.
[01:42:10.046 --> 01:42:12.167]  He started with newspaper articles.
[01:42:12.247 --> 01:42:15.830]  Anything bad that happened, it had to be caused by the Jews.
[01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:21.333]  It wasn't true, but if you say it, you get people thinking in that direction.
[01:42:22.083 --> 01:42:23.684]  And then they move.
[01:42:24.404 --> 01:42:27.005]  Your website is InfoWars.com.
[01:42:27.645 --> 01:42:31.686]  I teach my class that we are in an ideological war.
[01:42:32.046 --> 01:42:33.487]  A war of ideas.
[01:42:33.887 --> 01:42:38.368]  And it's a war of individual rights versus this collectivist activity.
[01:42:39.009 --> 01:42:43.690]  And the other team is winning because we're not sure how they're fighting the war.
[01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:45.551]  They change definitions.
[01:42:46.031 --> 01:42:49.752]  They just keep promoting the same lies over and over again.
[01:42:50.362 --> 01:42:55.945]  And I don't remember who it was, but they said if you tell a lie often enough, people are going to believe it.
[01:42:55.965 --> 01:42:56.285]  It was Hitler.
[01:42:56.305 --> 01:42:56.765]  It was Hitler.
[01:42:57.806 --> 01:42:58.126]  You know?
[01:42:58.887 --> 01:43:01.888]  So, that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:43:02.268 --> 01:43:03.809]  And I'm rather proud.
[01:43:03.869 --> 01:43:14.515]  I had the Anti-Defamation League include me on a list of right-wing extremists and racists because I presented in Florida recently.
[01:43:16.926 --> 01:43:18.368]  Well, now they list Lou Dobbs.
[01:43:18.408 --> 01:43:20.371]  I've got that in the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:43:20.412 --> 01:43:21.894]  They basically say he's a terrorist.
[01:43:21.914 --> 01:43:25.399]  I mean, they've just discredited them themselves.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:28.424]  That's all these idiots are doing, is discrediting themselves.
[01:43:28.444 --> 01:43:29.506]  Everybody's laughing at this.
[01:43:30.919 --> 01:43:33.861]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:43:34.022 --> 01:43:39.246]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:44.890]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:43:45.271 --> 01:43:46.371]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:46.752 --> 01:43:55.639]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[01:43:56.039 --> 01:43:57.680]  Now, compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.061]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:44:02.101 --> 01:44:06.722]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:44:07.122 --> 01:44:10.563]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:44:10.963 --> 01:44:11.723]  Keep it natural.
[01:44:12.043 --> 01:44:20.146]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:44:20.446 --> 01:44:24.607]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:44:25.007 --> 01:44:29.672]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:44:31.434 --> 01:44:36.680]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:37.450 --> 01:44:42.813]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:49.537]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:49.837 --> 01:44:51.658]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:54.199]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:54.279 --> 01:45:05.165]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:45:07.452 --> 01:45:08.713]  It's not about left or right.
[01:45:09.113 --> 01:45:10.514]  It's about a one world government.
[01:45:10.974 --> 01:45:17.317]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:25.662]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:26.142 --> 01:45:27.303]  The Obama Deception.
[01:45:27.723 --> 01:45:28.904]  The people strike back.
[01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:33.650]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:38.251]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:45:38.471 --> 01:45:40.651]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:45:40.971 --> 01:45:46.932]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:45:47.252 --> 01:45:53.574]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[01:45:54.814 --> 01:45:56.857]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[01:45:57.077 --> 01:46:04.205]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits, seed vegetables, and antioxidants.

[01:46:32.527 --> 01:46:36.530]  Each mountain down, loaded up and truckin'.
[01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:38.972]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[01:46:42.487 --> 01:46:43.928]  We got a long way to go.
[01:46:43.948 --> 01:46:46.350]  And a short time to get there.
[01:46:46.451 --> 01:46:52.075]  I was doing 130 on the way to work this morning.
[01:46:52.316 --> 01:46:56.559]  I'm just joking, I don't do that.
[01:46:56.979 --> 01:47:01.924]  Alright, I'm joking folks.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:21.484]  We're going to do at least 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:47:21.504 --> 01:47:23.205]  We're going to be opening the phones up.
[01:47:23.225 --> 01:47:25.145]  Everybody that's been holding, you can call 888-201-2244.
[01:47:25.165 --> 01:47:25.205]  888-201-2244.
[01:47:25.225 --> 01:47:25.266]  888-201-2244.
[01:47:36.555 --> 01:47:36.915]  888-201-2244.
[01:47:36.935 --> 01:47:49.239]  We'll go right to your calls when we start the next hour with Michael McNerney and Jason Bermas reading over the 200-something pages of the Virginia Fusion Center document, which says, you are a terrorist if you believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:47:49.279 --> 01:47:53.661]  I mean, this thing is the worst thing I've ever read in my life, and we just got this an hour ago.
[01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:56.004]  We're feverishly trying to read over it right now.
[01:47:56.044 --> 01:47:56.925]  In fact, cut over to Burmy.
[01:47:57.586 --> 01:48:00.110]  In a second, I guess you can't see the table.
[01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:01.412]  Show him on that camera.
[01:48:01.672 --> 01:48:03.314]  I mean, there's all the documents spread out.
[01:48:03.354 --> 01:48:06.339]  He's over there highlighting them, getting them all ready.
[01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.240]  Down there on the table.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.962]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:48:10.523 --> 01:48:12.543]  Before I end this hour, get the word out.
[01:48:12.583 --> 01:48:14.344]  These terrorists can't stop us.
[01:48:14.364 --> 01:48:16.884]  They carried out 9-11 and the banking collapsed.
[01:48:16.944 --> 01:48:18.165]  We expose what they're doing.
[01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.665]  And that's what the Obama Deception does.
[01:48:20.705 --> 01:48:21.665]  So get the DVD.
[01:48:21.705 --> 01:48:22.385]  We're now caught up.
[01:48:22.425 --> 01:48:24.926]  We're shipping like the day after we got the order out.
[01:48:24.946 --> 01:48:26.306]  We got caught up on shipping.
[01:48:26.326 --> 01:48:29.167]  So get your orders in for the Obama Deception at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:29.207 --> 01:48:31.507]  And here's some of the other sponsors at the end of the main transmission.
[01:48:31.967 --> 01:48:32.588]  Then we're coming back.
[01:48:32.608 --> 01:48:33.708]  I want to thank them for helping us.
[01:48:34.528 --> 01:48:35.128]  And everything done.

[01:49:04.827 --> 01:49:06.628]  You're nuts if you don't get self-sufficient.
[01:49:06.928 --> 01:49:10.430]  The globalists want to shut things down, so you've got to come hand-in-hand to them.
[01:49:10.770 --> 01:49:13.251]  You'll never ever stand on the bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:49:13.311 --> 01:49:15.992]  efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[01:49:16.813 --> 01:49:18.393]  Continuing here, Home Gain.
[01:49:18.433 --> 01:49:22.355]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, homegain.com.
[01:49:22.595 --> 01:49:25.637]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor,

[01:49:49.062 --> 01:49:52.927]  For 10 years these folks have been helping folks sell their homes and helping buyers.
[01:49:53.247 --> 01:49:54.909]  Visit their link at Infowars.com.
[01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:58.013]  Look for Max the Orange Home Gain Gorilla.
[01:49:58.033 --> 01:49:58.714]  Here he is right here.
[01:49:59.910 --> 01:50:00.631]  Very evil.
[01:50:00.671 --> 01:50:04.596]  He's probably in the Fusion Report or something, because he knows how to read.
[01:50:04.616 --> 01:50:06.138]  We're doing how to read is wrong.
[01:50:06.158 --> 01:50:09.261]  Again, you will love the site, homegame.com.
[01:50:09.822 --> 01:50:19.273]  And last but not least of our sponsors here at the end of the main transmission, we're going into overdrive, internetonly, infowars.com, audio streams, and prisonplanet.tv on the video.
[01:50:20.394 --> 01:50:28.517]  Jason Barbas has got Max Keiser on tonight, and I'm going to pop in in the last hour, going after Glenn Beck at his latest Disinfo piece, after I do two hours with Raleigh James.
[01:50:28.817 --> 01:50:30.737]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[01:50:30.777 --> 01:50:31.678]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[01:50:31.698 --> 01:50:35.839]  Now you can grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free of the New World Order.
[01:50:36.179 --> 01:50:41.001]  Our sponsor, Survivalist Seeds, has now drastically reduced the price of their heirloom seeds at survivalistseeds.com.
[01:50:43.081 --> 01:50:50.045]  There's a real heirloom seed shortage right now, so people interested in growing their own healthy food need to get the heirloom seeds now and start their gardens this spring.
[01:50:50.165 --> 01:50:51.306]  Freedom starts with action.
[01:50:51.606 --> 01:50:53.147]  Survival of seeds has got to come.
[01:50:53.187 --> 01:50:55.588]  It's how you survive the world economic collapse.
[01:50:55.908 --> 01:51:00.671]  Yes, firearms, food, seeds, gold, silver, and guts and God, baby.
[01:51:00.851 --> 01:51:03.132]  Retransmission starts in 20 minutes.
[01:51:03.372 --> 01:51:09.936]  We're going to be back live in 70 seconds, right here on The Info War with Burmese and Michael Bagnerik.
[01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:10.516]  Stay with us.

[01:51:13.357 --> 01:51:16.679]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:20.122]  Yeah, I'm starting my attack run now.
[01:51:20.542 --> 01:51:21.123]  Hello, friends.
[01:51:21.183 --> 01:51:22.124]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:51:22.244 --> 01:51:26.847]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:26.987 --> 01:51:29.749]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:29.949 --> 01:51:32.812]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:32.992 --> 01:51:34.473]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome.
[01:51:34.693 --> 01:51:36.634]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:51:36.774 --> 01:51:38.154]  In any emergency... How many guns?
[01:51:38.234 --> 01:51:39.614]  I don't care about the guns.
[01:51:39.634 --> 01:51:41.995]  No one is going to take care of your family.
[01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:49.197]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:49.297 --> 01:51:52.418]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:52.558 --> 01:51:52.758]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:52.818 --> 01:51:54.458]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:57.699 --> 01:52:03.783]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scried, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:52:03.963 --> 01:52:11.107]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:52:11.127 --> 01:52:15.170]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:16.311]  Take action today.
[01:52:16.471 --> 01:52:18.272]  The first step is getting scorable food.
[01:52:18.792 --> 01:52:19.953]  Initiate Overdrive!
[01:52:56.575 --> 01:53:03.958]  Alright, we are locked and loaded.
[01:53:04.199 --> 01:53:07.060]  Jason Burmas in the studio.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.061]  He'll be live tonight, 9 to midnight, out of the Info Wars Command Center.
[01:53:10.081 --> 01:53:11.782]  And make no mistake, it is the Command Center.
[01:53:13.439 --> 01:53:20.104]  I can't believe we're in this position, because I didn't ask for this job, and Lord knows I'm probably not up to it, but you know what?
[01:53:21.005 --> 01:53:37.418]  The job's got to be done, so we're trying to mobilize humanity, literally against the eugenicists, exterminators, and out there in the fight, a great captain in the defense of liberty, resistance to tyranny, is Michael Bagner, a constitutional scholar, an amazing political mind, former presidential nominee.
[01:53:38.619 --> 01:53:45.803]  And candidate, the candidate 2004, with America's third largest party, the Libertarian Party, with us for another 20 minutes.
[01:53:46.164 --> 01:53:52.007]  Michael, I'm going to try to shut up here, because we've had a great banter back and forth for about five minutes, for you to go over where you see us going.
[01:53:52.367 --> 01:53:59.892]  If this is the time for the greatest effort in mobilization to warn people about the criminal hijacking of the nation, then we're going to get more into this unbelievable Virginia
[01:54:05.145 --> 01:54:13.828]  I think this is the time.
[01:54:13.888 --> 01:54:18.710]  This is the time that you and I and all of our other patriot leaders have been predicting.
[01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:23.372]  There's going to come a time when the people are going to have to stand up and defend their own right.
[01:54:23.812 --> 01:54:24.632]  And it's beginning.
[01:54:24.972 --> 01:54:25.572]  It is now.
[01:54:27.866 --> 01:54:32.490]  I recommend that people find out about the Tea Party.
[01:54:33.010 --> 01:54:41.176]  Nearest to them there's going to be 150, I've seen that number up to a thousand in different cities.
[01:54:41.436 --> 01:54:49.561]  And we use that, I'm sorry I always interrupt, we use that to go out and educate and quote radicalize the people that are there to the full spectrum.
[01:54:49.582 --> 01:54:49.862]  Go ahead.
[01:54:50.509 --> 01:54:56.895]  Yeah, so if you want to meet with other people that feel the same way you do, you're not in this alone.
[01:54:56.935 --> 01:54:58.817]  You are not doing this by yourself.
[01:54:59.217 --> 01:55:11.108]  Go out to a tea party rally, help out with the people there, network, get to know other people's phone numbers and email addresses, and do what you can in your area.
[01:55:11.756 --> 01:55:18.279]  I am now the coordinator, the Texas coordinator for Continental Congress 2009.
[01:55:18.539 --> 01:55:26.322]  The website is wethepeoplecongress.org.
[01:55:26.702 --> 01:55:29.823]  You can, there's a little tab there, you can select your state.
[01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:32.152]  And we're trying to organize.
[01:55:32.512 --> 01:55:34.395]  Everybody knows the government is out of control.
[01:55:34.415 --> 01:55:36.557]  The question is, what do we do about it?
[01:55:36.937 --> 01:55:49.532]  We want to nominate three delegates from each state, just like they did before the Declaration of Independence, and get 150 of the brightest political minds in the United States to decide where we go from here.
[01:55:50.172 --> 01:55:51.553]  So, we need your help.
[01:55:51.593 --> 01:55:56.414]  There's going to be a conference call next Tuesday at 7pm.
[01:55:56.834 --> 01:56:09.839]  Go to the website, it's got the conference call listed, and definitely attend one of the many, many, many Tea Party rallies that are being held next week on Wednesday the 15th of April.
[01:56:10.979 --> 01:56:12.259]  Well, well done my friend.
[01:56:12.279 --> 01:56:13.420]  We really commend you here.
[01:56:17.847 --> 01:56:18.689]  I totally agree with you.
[01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:20.715]  It's the over-the-top nature of all of this.
[01:56:20.815 --> 01:56:23.382]  I mean, it's just becoming too insane.
[01:56:24.829 --> 01:56:31.130]  And I just want to remind your listeners one more time, I've been teaching my Constitution class since 2001.
[01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:37.911]  I'll be in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 25th and 26th.
[01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:44.133]  A huge End the Fed rally on Saturday the 25th.
[01:56:44.173 --> 01:56:45.953]  They've invited me to be one of the speakers.
[01:56:46.413 --> 01:56:51.434]  I'll be teaching my Constitution class on Sunday, right after the rally.
[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:53.851]  The day after the rally.
[01:56:54.031 --> 01:56:58.854]  And your listeners, anybody listening to Alex Jones right now, can go to my website.
[01:56:58.894 --> 01:57:00.595]  You get a $15 discount.
[01:57:00.615 --> 01:57:02.416]  It may not be much, but it's what I can do.
[01:57:03.077 --> 01:57:10.862]  And just click on the PayPal button on my homepage, constitutionpreservation.org, and there's a little tab there.
[01:57:11.222 --> 01:57:13.744]  They should put in, Long Live the Republic.
[01:57:13.964 --> 01:57:18.387]  That way I know that it's actually part of your program.
[01:57:18.447 --> 01:57:20.408]  Now, I want to expand on something here.
[01:57:22.304 --> 01:57:26.346]  Just like they said Al Qaeda is about to get us right before they stage the 9-11 attacks.
[01:57:27.526 --> 01:57:32.808]  And I said this months ago, I said they're saying that China and Russia are going to attack the web and shut the web down.
[01:57:33.428 --> 01:57:35.049]  Meanwhile, they've caught clearly U.S.
[01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:40.851]  submarines out cutting major cables to Europe and Asia and Russia and the Middle East.
[01:57:41.852 --> 01:57:43.072]  In the last year that's been happening.
[01:57:43.392 --> 01:57:45.413]  They've cut as many as four cables in one week.
[01:57:46.194 --> 01:57:48.154]  So all sorts of espionage.
[01:57:48.174 --> 01:57:51.816]  You've got Jay Rockefeller separately saying we'd be better off never having an internet.
[01:57:52.912 --> 01:57:59.718]  You've got Mother Jones admitting, and that's a liberal site, newspaper magazine, that Obama wants to take the web over.
[01:57:59.758 --> 01:58:02.461]  Their intelligence czar quit three weeks ago.
[01:58:03.041 --> 01:58:06.805]  The cyber security czar, who was an Obama guy, saying, this is fascism.
[01:58:06.845 --> 01:58:07.826]  You're taking the web over.
[01:58:08.086 --> 01:58:13.812]  The Pentagon is going to make all private internet businesses, whoever they want, down to a computer and a hard drive.
[01:58:14.372 --> 01:58:21.038]  Put in government snooping hubs, where the government automatically has no Fourth or Fifth Amendment and reads everything.
[01:58:21.218 --> 01:58:23.420]  Even Keith Olbermann's now attacked Obama for this.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:26.603]  I mean, because this is off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:27.324 --> 01:58:30.407]  And then, look, General warns of growing threat from cyber attacks.
[01:58:30.807 --> 01:58:32.489]  Cyber attacks pose an increasingly serious...
[01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:34.110]  Costly threat to U.S.
[01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:36.011]  government and commercial networks that the U.S.
[01:58:36.031 --> 01:58:37.311]  General warned Tuesday.
[01:58:37.351 --> 01:58:42.674]  So their own guys quit saying it's a takeover, and they're saying, oh, we're about to be hit by Russia and China to shut the web down.
[01:58:43.054 --> 01:58:47.917]  Then they'll shut it off and make us go to Internet 2, which they admit is highly controlled and no freedom.
[01:58:48.217 --> 01:58:57.222]  So along with the collapsing economy, along with the riots they want to stage, they don't want me being able to counter the New York Times when they say I'm calling for cop killing, when I'm saying the opposite.
[01:58:57.722 --> 01:59:05.915]  They want to carry out their crimes of lies against me and Bagnaric and the movement and everybody else should write stuff that Lou Dobbs is a terrorist, you know, in the...
[01:59:07.762 --> 01:59:10.704]  These are the guys that started the report saying I said kill the cops, basically.
[01:59:11.764 --> 01:59:13.345]  This is the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:59:14.226 --> 01:59:16.968]  This month's issue, by the way, I'm in there, along with Lou Dobbs.
[01:59:17.488 --> 01:59:19.969]  So, we have to understand something here.
[01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:21.590]  This is real.
[01:59:21.991 --> 01:59:25.673]  The people running things funded Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot.
[01:59:26.033 --> 01:59:29.155]  Did you guys ever pull up that article about German government says U.S.
[01:59:29.175 --> 01:59:30.176]  government funded Pol Pot?
[01:59:31.737 --> 01:59:32.377]  Did you ever find that?
[01:59:35.703 --> 01:59:38.825]  In Google News, try something like U.S.
[01:59:38.865 --> 01:59:40.466]  Pol Pot, or U.S.
[01:59:40.486 --> 01:59:41.807]  Khmer Rouge, and it'll come up.
[01:59:43.108 --> 01:59:47.191]  The issue here is, these people don't care about us, do they, Michael Bagneri?
[01:59:47.731 --> 01:59:48.892]  No, absolutely not.
[01:59:48.952 --> 01:59:53.555]  We are useless eaters to them, and they want to reduce our population.
[01:59:53.575 --> 01:59:59.058]  They want to eliminate anybody that disapproves of their actions.
[01:59:59.199 --> 02:00:01.220]  Anybody who is guilty of dissent.
[02:00:02.265 --> 02:00:08.308]  And George Bush did that after the tragedy in New York.
[02:00:08.348 --> 02:00:10.368]  He said, you're either with us or you're against us.
[02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:15.511]  And, you know, if they're going to be violating the Constitution, I'm against them.
[02:00:15.831 --> 02:00:23.594]  I'm going to do everything I can, as long as I am capable of taking a breath, to promote liberty and protect our Constitutional Republic.
[02:00:24.314 --> 02:00:25.995]  That's the legacy I hope to leave.
[02:00:33.257 --> 02:00:34.779]  with Khmer Rouge, grew out of U.S.
[02:00:34.799 --> 02:00:35.960]  defeat in Vietnam.
[02:00:36.961 --> 02:00:39.003]  Click on, see you clicked web there, Paul.
[02:00:39.323 --> 02:00:42.667]  If you click news, it was, government documents were just released.
[02:00:45.527 --> 02:00:51.451]  And, uh, I mean, my whole point is Brzezinski brags about it, but, you know, it's like, oh, Alex talks about freedom.
[02:00:51.491 --> 02:00:52.932]  That made a guy shoot a cop.
[02:00:53.333 --> 02:00:54.193]  Totally made up.
[02:00:54.594 --> 02:00:58.056]  And then, oh, but Brzezinski brags he helped kill three million.
[02:00:58.356 --> 02:00:59.257]  Oh, how liberal!
[02:00:59.597 --> 02:01:00.798]  Oh, beautiful!
[02:01:01.318 --> 02:01:02.059]  Beautiful!
[02:01:02.399 --> 02:01:03.420]  I mean, isn't this sick?
[02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:07.663]  It is criminally insane.
[02:01:08.223 --> 02:01:09.284]  It is psychopathic.
[02:01:10.765 --> 02:01:14.868]  And, you know, there's no way to negotiate with a terrorist.
[02:01:15.453 --> 02:01:16.914]  I mean, we're going to have to stand up.
[02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:20.095]  And, you know, everybody wants change.
[02:01:20.695 --> 02:01:22.535]  Nobody wants it to be violent.
[02:01:22.936 --> 02:01:25.737]  And you and I don't want it to be violent, but we're going to need numbers.
[02:01:26.157 --> 02:01:28.658]  We're going to need millions of people to stand up.
[02:01:29.278 --> 02:01:35.220]  And like they stood up for the Ron Paul campaign, they are standing up for these tea parties.
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:42.690]  Apparently this was started by one blogger who was going to happen in Seattle and it has just spread like wildfire.
[02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:46.635]  Well actually 9-11 Truth has been having tea parties and that kind of spurred it.
[02:01:47.276 --> 02:01:52.163]  The idea of liberation and revolution against tyranny begins is that
[02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:57.569]  For those that don't understand, people kept saying, oh, Ron Paul didn't win, all that money, all that was a loss.
[02:01:57.649 --> 02:02:03.515]  No, it educated people about the bankers, about the inflation tax, about the New World Order, about the globalists.
[02:02:03.856 --> 02:02:09.561]  It's now the number one thing, not communism or fascism, you know, not liberalism or conservatism, on the campuses.
[02:02:10.482 --> 02:02:31.451]  And out of that now is spinning off all these other groups like Oath Keepers and everything else and it just builds and builds and it's organic and it's decentralized and it can't be stopped and it's just growing and now Nexus Pointing and they're all interconnecting and it's just powering up like a huge warehouse of dynamos.
[02:02:33.611 --> 02:02:34.292]  I think so.
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.181]  This is not the old Soviet Union.
[02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:56.082]  They're not going to get away with killing 50 million of us.
[02:02:56.522 --> 02:02:59.783]  We are not the disarmed Cambodians, poor people.
[02:03:00.243 --> 02:03:06.206]  And look folks, when they try their crap, it is going to end in the security forces being absolutely decimated.
[02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.087]  We don't want that to happen.
[02:03:08.767 --> 02:03:15.470]  I mean, I'm old enough, I have a family, I have children, I'm not 18 anymore where you have that wild-eyed thing of violence being a good idea.
[02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:17.571]  That's why they want you when you're young and dumb.
[02:03:18.072 --> 02:03:19.012]  I don't want the violence.
[02:03:19.072 --> 02:03:20.133]  I don't want it to be 1776.
[02:03:20.613 --> 02:03:22.113]  I don't want it to go to that.
[02:03:22.174 --> 02:03:28.096]  But sure, as the sun came up this morning, the globalists are pushing into that and they know it's going to happen.
[02:03:28.336 --> 02:03:30.858]  And it's going to chew up the military and police like you've never seen.
[02:03:31.718 --> 02:03:35.580]  Because there's millions of people that just aren't putting up with the crap anymore.
[02:03:36.261 --> 02:03:39.983]  And, hey, don't get mad at me that I warned you when you're putting your foot in the bear trap.
[02:03:40.323 --> 02:03:44.525]  I'm telling you now, and in your gut, you know I'm telling you the truth, police and military.
[02:03:44.825 --> 02:03:45.886]  So I'm going to tell you right now.
[02:03:46.726 --> 02:03:48.007]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[02:03:48.107 --> 02:03:56.772]  You are controlled by very evil people who are marching you right into a giant column of the American people that aren't under my control.
[02:03:57.112 --> 02:04:00.334]  And this is not going to be like the killing fields that the globalists
[02:04:01.888 --> 02:04:10.430]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:19.472]  People are waking up, and it is this information war, an ideological war, and our numbers are growing.
[02:04:19.532 --> 02:04:22.753]  The pendulum is swinging in the other direction very rapidly.
[02:04:24.788 --> 02:04:29.030]  The bad news is some people have taken this long to figure things out.
[02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:36.293]  The good news is the people who are just jumping on board now are really, really passionate.
[02:04:36.333 --> 02:04:38.754]  Just like that guy that called me and said, we've got to do something.
[02:04:38.774 --> 02:04:39.975]  We've got to do something now.
[02:04:40.615 --> 02:04:44.157]  So these people are looking for a direction.
[02:04:44.917 --> 02:04:47.138]  And we have built the infrastructure.
[02:04:47.178 --> 02:04:50.480]  We've been telling them, get involved.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:51.940]  Participate in these tea parties.
[02:04:54.113 --> 02:04:56.574]  Go to my website and get a copy of my book.
[02:04:56.874 --> 02:05:00.754]  In fact, Chapter 2 of my book is available for free.
[02:05:01.655 --> 02:05:05.355]  The idea of rights versus privileges.
[02:05:05.955 --> 02:05:14.937]  Go to constitutionpreservation.org, follow the link to book, and you can download Chapter 2, forward that to all of your friends.
[02:05:15.017 --> 02:05:18.938]  If everybody in the United States read that, you know, we would be moving
[02:05:19.258 --> 02:05:20.659]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:05:20.739 --> 02:05:27.103]  I want to go to phone calls, but Burmese for an hour plus has been reading the new Fusion Center report out of Virginia.
[02:05:27.123 --> 02:05:27.863]  These are secret.
[02:05:28.184 --> 02:05:28.924]  This is secret.
[02:05:28.944 --> 02:05:30.765]  Remember, we broke the Maya and people didn't believe it.
[02:05:31.025 --> 02:05:32.086]  This is far worse.
[02:05:32.106 --> 02:05:33.067]  You can call the phone numbers.
[02:05:33.107 --> 02:05:34.928]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:34.968 --> 02:05:36.589]  Nemo's going to do a more detailed report on it.
[02:05:36.889 --> 02:05:40.371]  Got a big Chemtel report coming out at PrisonPlanet.com in the next little while.
[02:05:42.432 --> 02:05:43.853]  Let's get the home gang guerrilla out of here.
[02:05:43.873 --> 02:05:44.594]  This is ridiculous.
[02:05:45.859 --> 02:05:46.500]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:47.821]  Sure, Alex.
[02:05:47.861 --> 02:05:58.129]  Well, just going through this, this harkens back to the first time that I saw 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and you literally in that film said, we are the terrorists, everything is terrorism.
[02:05:58.169 --> 02:06:00.370]  And I didn't believe that, Alex, but right here.
[02:06:01.411 --> 02:06:03.032]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:06:03.052 --> 02:06:06.915]  I mean, I remember going back and trying to, uh, you know, source everything, and I could.
[02:06:07.055 --> 02:06:09.937]  And I still couldn't believe, you know, this was the real deal.
[02:06:09.977 --> 02:06:11.938]  But in this one, there is no doubt.
[02:06:11.978 --> 02:06:14.760]  You know, you just talked about cybercrime and cyberterrorism.
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:18.203]  Well, here's that subsection, and, uh... Everything's terror!
[02:06:18.263 --> 02:06:20.364]  Yes, now, this is, uh, now terrorism.
[02:06:20.624 --> 02:06:27.709]  The nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends is now terrorism.
[02:06:27.969 --> 02:06:28.770]  So it can be legal.
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:30.701]  But it's terrorism, Alex.
[02:06:30.781 --> 02:06:31.702]  I hope you're listening.
[02:06:31.742 --> 02:06:32.243]  Bullet points.
[02:06:32.263 --> 02:06:33.824]  We need a massive story.
[02:06:34.445 --> 02:06:49.039]  Remember when they introduced a bill the feds wrote in 2003 in Oregon that said downloading music terrorism, life in prison and a forced labor camp in a forest labor camp was the quote.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:52.843]  And remember what PC World reported.
[02:06:54.187 --> 02:06:58.570]  Obama is signing a secret treaty to ban all peer-to-peer anyways.
[02:06:58.730 --> 02:06:59.271]  Yeah.
[02:06:59.291 --> 02:07:00.232]  So keep going.
[02:07:00.292 --> 02:07:01.733]  Yeah, I mean, alright, let's keep going.
[02:07:01.913 --> 02:07:07.337]  These tools include website defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft.
[02:07:07.717 --> 02:07:09.458]  Here's the one that's just unbelievable right here.
[02:07:09.759 --> 02:07:10.920]  Website parodies.
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.862]  Apparently, we can't parody things with websites.
[02:07:14.042 --> 02:07:14.842]  It's unbelievable.
[02:07:15.323 --> 02:07:19.266]  Virtual sit-ins, virtual sabotage, and software development.
[02:07:19.546 --> 02:07:23.309]  Software development, Alex, is now cyber-terrorism.
[02:07:23.729 --> 02:07:26.151]  I mean, how off the charts is that?
[02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.252]  For any political purpose.
[02:07:27.433 --> 02:07:30.495]  And this is law enforcement sensitive, just like the MIAC report.
[02:07:30.976 --> 02:07:36.181]  Because they want to do this lying and cheating and slandering and defaming in the dark.
[02:07:36.221 --> 02:07:37.222]  Okay, go to the next section.
[02:07:37.242 --> 02:07:37.782]  There's too many.
[02:07:38.223 --> 02:07:39.604]  Tell folks that section that want to know.
[02:07:39.624 --> 02:07:40.505]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:07:40.525 --> 02:07:43.708]  Yeah, that is page 81, and this is the cyber terrorism section.
[02:07:43.728 --> 02:07:44.749]  Okay, continue, continue.
[02:07:44.769 --> 02:07:45.129]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.890]  Here, right here.
[02:07:47.211 --> 02:07:49.132]  ...is the lone wolf extremist.
[02:07:49.192 --> 02:07:54.214]  Now, if you are included in social, political, or religious causes... I haven't read that yet.
[02:07:54.234 --> 02:07:58.076]  It says you, but I've seen it before by other feds putting it out.
[02:07:58.796 --> 02:08:01.758]  Locking your desk, not talking, being pro-Second Amendment terrorist.
[02:08:01.898 --> 02:08:04.039]  Yeah, I mean it's un-bog-lievable.
[02:08:04.059 --> 02:08:05.299]  Does it say locking your desk?
[02:08:05.519 --> 02:08:07.040]  I'm not sure if that's in here.
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:12.643]  They always also say mainline groups that have soup kitchens and say sheriffs have authority.
[02:08:12.683 --> 02:08:13.523]  They say that's terrorism.
[02:08:13.703 --> 02:08:16.726]  Yeah, they're going hardcore after anti-abortion groups.
[02:08:16.746 --> 02:08:23.671]  I mean, they're listing colleges like James Madison University as a possible place to harbor terrorism.
[02:08:24.212 --> 02:08:24.652]  What's another?
[02:08:25.093 --> 02:08:26.414]  University College of William and Mary.
[02:08:26.454 --> 02:08:33.740]  So now, if you're a Christian and you don't believe in abortion, if you're part of Life and Liberty Ministries, you may be a terrorist.
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:37.142]  See, what's happening is now 70 plus percent of people are against abortion.
[02:08:37.162 --> 02:08:38.182]  We're winning that fight too.
[02:08:38.202 --> 02:08:43.445]  They're finding out it's not a blob of tissue, because all the vans driving around showing a baby at a month old being chopped up.
[02:08:43.825 --> 02:08:46.266]  So see, okay, please continue with how we're all terrorists.
[02:08:46.286 --> 02:08:47.887]  Yes, I mean, let's just go through it.
[02:08:47.927 --> 02:08:53.509]  I mean, if you're trying to recruit people for your cause, you're radicalizing them, therefore it's terrorism.
[02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:54.570]  Where is that?
[02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:55.470]  What section is that?
[02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:57.591]  That is recruitment and radicalization.
[02:08:57.611 --> 02:08:58.132]  That is page 125.
[02:08:58.172 --> 02:09:00.493]  Let's see if I even have that in front of me.
[02:09:01.273 --> 02:09:05.114]  Again, this is a 215-page document, folks, and I'm just one person.
[02:09:05.134 --> 02:09:05.995]  Continue, continue.
[02:09:06.135 --> 02:09:07.375]  Yeah, let's go to that.
[02:09:07.515 --> 02:09:08.255]  I think I have that one.
[02:09:08.275 --> 02:09:08.976]  What is that one?
[02:09:09.036 --> 02:09:10.936]  Go over to the other areas you have lit up.
[02:09:10.956 --> 02:09:11.856]  Sure, sure.
[02:09:12.697 --> 02:09:13.137]  Let's see.
[02:09:14.157 --> 02:09:15.018]  This is just the beginning.
[02:09:15.058 --> 02:09:17.718]  Listen, you've got to do Control-F searches for, like, Ron Paul.
[02:09:17.818 --> 02:09:18.098]  I did.
[02:09:18.579 --> 02:09:19.439]  Ron Paul's not in there.
[02:09:19.659 --> 02:09:20.739]  Libertarian's not in there.
[02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:22.120]  Infowars is not in there.
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:25.021]  I did the Control-F searches, so I was kind of just going through each spot.
[02:09:25.041 --> 02:09:25.721]  What about Second Amendment?
[02:09:26.221 --> 02:09:28.563]  I didn't do Second Amendment, so I'm not quite sure.
[02:09:28.623 --> 02:09:30.124]  I do have to do a CTRL-F search.
[02:09:30.325 --> 02:09:32.406]  I mean, this was really off-the-cuff, Alex.
[02:09:32.507 --> 02:09:36.410]  I mean, people who are starting anti-Obama websites are apparently terrorists.
[02:09:36.710 --> 02:09:38.832]  Read that!
[02:09:38.852 --> 02:09:40.133]  What page is that on?
[02:09:40.173 --> 02:09:41.474]  That is page 60.
[02:09:42.275 --> 02:09:50.822]  Apparently, one of the militia groups out there, Virginia Militia Groups, the group appears to have been started as a direct result of the founders' frustration with the Obama administration.
[02:09:50.882 --> 02:09:52.964]  And I mean, notice they're spying on all these groups.
[02:09:53.064 --> 02:09:56.467]  Yeah, no, every single one of these, they talk about how they have surveillance at the end.
[02:09:56.487 --> 02:10:04.115]  You see, this is going county by county, in subsections, literally saying where these groups are, who they are, and how they... That's the issue!
[02:10:04.175 --> 02:10:05.897]  This is a surveillance document!
[02:10:05.977 --> 02:10:08.039]  Oh my God, this is... just like when they got caught...
[02:10:08.599 --> 02:10:13.901]  Nemo, when you do a story, point out that they, in Virginia and in New York, they've been caught spying on the bike-riding groups.
[02:10:13.921 --> 02:10:21.864]  Because you've got to get a... Michael Bagnerik, I mean, it's bad enough to have secret police everywhere, but they're spying on the anti-death penalty groups and the bike-riding groups?
[02:10:23.208 --> 02:10:26.832]  Well, apparently we don't have freedom of speech in this country anymore.
[02:10:27.793 --> 02:10:39.885]  During the presidential campaign, I spoke at a college in an auditorium, and they wouldn't move to a smaller room because it was a free speech zone.
[02:10:40.686 --> 02:10:45.651]  And I told that audience that anywhere I happen to be standing is a free speech zone.
[02:10:49.576 --> 02:10:55.580]  When I teach my class, the purpose of freedom of speech is freedom of political speech.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:02.525]  If we have the right to alter... That is the most protected speech there is, but now we don't even have free speech zones.
[02:11:02.565 --> 02:11:03.485]  Now we just got rid of it.
[02:11:03.506 --> 02:11:07.028]  They turn it right into a privilege, then they sequester it, then they get rid of it.
[02:11:07.608 --> 02:11:08.309]  Unbelievable.
[02:11:08.349 --> 02:11:09.129]  Burmas, continue.
[02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.990]  I want to go through some calls.
[02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:12.011]  Sure, here's just another subsection.
[02:11:12.311 --> 02:11:13.751]  Terrorist extremist group presence.
[02:11:14.111 --> 02:11:22.174]  It is important to note that university-based students groups are recognized as a radicalization node for almost every type of extremist group.
[02:11:22.294 --> 02:11:24.955]  You're in college, you're an extremist, you're a terrorist.
[02:11:24.975 --> 02:11:26.595]  A radicalization node.
[02:11:26.655 --> 02:11:31.177]  Yes, if you go to college, Alex, apparently you might be involved in extremism and terrorism.
[02:11:32.197 --> 02:11:34.718]  Remember when they said at Rhode, Almanac's a sign of terrorism?
[02:11:35.058 --> 02:11:37.159]  And the Texas report said blue jeans and cell phones.
[02:11:37.439 --> 02:11:39.299]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls while you're reading over that.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:42.280]  Somebody disagrees, so we'll go to Dave in Florida first.
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:42.941]  He disagrees.
[02:11:43.441 --> 02:11:46.522]  Dave, tell me everything's wonderful, I guess.
[02:11:46.542 --> 02:11:48.862]  What's going on?
[02:11:48.942 --> 02:11:49.823]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:11:50.063 --> 02:11:50.603]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:51.643 --> 02:11:59.486]  Yeah, no, Alex, I'm a great fan of the show, and I think you do great work and everything, and I'm trying to wake people up.
[02:12:00.325 --> 02:12:11.149]  You know, I recommend the websites and you and I often have to defend you and I'm saying stuff and I say, you know, and they'll say, oh, he's crazy or that or whatever.
[02:12:11.409 --> 02:12:20.252]  And like all day today, you've been saying that that AP article about Obama looks at climate engineering.
[02:12:21.368 --> 02:12:31.207]  You've been saying that it says in that article that they're spraying chemtrails and Obama said it and the AP saying it in that article and they're not!
[02:12:34.642 --> 02:12:40.485]  They're saying they're thinking, they're saying that they're thinking about it, and it's something that they're considering.
[02:12:41.326 --> 02:12:46.009]  And, you know, I know they're doing... Well, let me answer this guy's question for a second, Alex.
[02:12:46.029 --> 02:12:48.310]  You know, one of the stories I went over yesterday is U.S.
[02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:49.671]  to take up carbon mantle.
[02:12:49.931 --> 02:12:53.813]  See, they're going to lead the way into this new green economy.
[02:12:54.033 --> 02:12:54.774]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:12:54.834 --> 02:12:58.296]  Even Saudi Arabia now, you know, Lindsey Williams has said this is going to kill Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:58.496 --> 02:12:59.617]  The Saudi Arabians are pissed.
[02:12:59.977 --> 02:13:03.139]  They're actually coming out saying this whole thing is going to ruin them.
[02:13:03.559 --> 02:13:06.761]  So if you're talking, if it says terraforming in that article, I have not seen it.
[02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:09.142]  Folks, they've been doing this openly.
[02:13:09.162 --> 02:13:13.325]  We're going to have Rosalind Peterson on both of our shows very shortly to go over the chemtrails.
[02:13:13.365 --> 02:13:13.985]  Hey, do me a favor.
[02:13:14.005 --> 02:13:15.686]  Will you guys print me that article again?
[02:13:16.126 --> 02:13:19.088]  Somebody picked it up or something because it's not here in my stack.
[02:13:19.648 --> 02:13:24.471]  The article about, no, it's not in that stack because that's yesterday's stack.
[02:13:25.649 --> 02:13:26.829]  Okay, somebody had it out of here.
[02:13:26.849 --> 02:13:27.370]  Okay, thank you.
[02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:29.010]  Okay, look, AP.
[02:13:29.710 --> 02:13:47.897]  Now, the reason I flipped out when I saw this on air is because I know about his science advisor and I know about the three articles Paul Watson wrote last year where they admitted it and then to have Obama come out and say we're looking at it, my whole point is they admit that they have this terraforming and they say they've been
[02:13:48.137 --> 02:13:48.557]  I'm testing it.
[02:13:48.917 --> 02:13:52.739]  So I have the complete knowledge of this information.
[02:13:52.759 --> 02:13:56.621]  I wouldn't say the complete, but for what's public, I have the complete knowledge of it.
[02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:02.323]  And so have you read the other three articles where they admit that they're altering the atmosphere?
[02:14:03.824 --> 02:14:09.326]  Yeah, and I totally know... Listen, screw your friends then, man.
[02:14:09.886 --> 02:14:10.527]  No, no, no, no.
[02:14:10.627 --> 02:14:12.928]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:14:13.668 --> 02:14:14.208]  Is he still there?
[02:14:14.528 --> 02:14:15.069]  I'm so mad.
[02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.669]  Go ahead and finish.
[02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:33.120]  No, I'm just saying, can you see my point that it's hard that if I say, people will go to that article and say, Alex Jones said it said in this article they're doing that, and they'll go, it doesn't say that, and he's full of crap!
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:33.740]  Screw him!
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:34.380]  Screw him!
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:34.861]  Screw him!
[02:14:36.141 --> 02:14:38.202]  I mean, you know, this is what it comes down to.
[02:14:38.602 --> 02:14:42.023]  All this nitpicking and all of this bull, man.
[02:14:42.623 --> 02:14:44.803]  Look, I appreciate it.
[02:14:44.963 --> 02:14:46.264]  Let them have what they want, then.
[02:14:46.284 --> 02:14:48.664]  $12.8 trillion has already been stolen.
[02:14:49.125 --> 02:14:52.305]  I get emails saying that's made up when it's in Bloomberg and Associated Press.
[02:14:52.786 --> 02:14:54.766]  Okay, I didn't make any of this stuff up.
[02:14:55.146 --> 02:15:00.728]  That is a legalese, mime game that is being played, and frankly, I can't take it anymore.
[02:15:03.610 --> 02:15:05.210]  See, I'm sitting here... No, no, no.
[02:15:05.410 --> 02:15:06.431]  Appreciate your call.
[02:15:06.471 --> 02:15:07.111]  Let him go.
[02:15:07.291 --> 02:15:08.371]  I'm done talking to him.
[02:15:08.931 --> 02:15:09.832]  Sir, let me tell you something.
[02:15:09.912 --> 02:15:11.392]  Don't tell people to tune in to the show.
[02:15:11.632 --> 02:15:13.092]  I got a plan for you, okay?
[02:15:13.733 --> 02:15:14.353]  I got a plan.
[02:15:14.793 --> 02:15:16.773]  I got a plan and I want you to go by it, please.
[02:15:17.013 --> 02:15:17.914]  Don't ever listen again.
[02:15:18.234 --> 02:15:19.454]  I don't care, okay?
[02:15:20.294 --> 02:15:21.895]  I didn't lie about this.
[02:15:23.155 --> 02:15:25.695]  What I didn't do was play their propaganda game.
[02:15:26.356 --> 02:15:31.357]  Yes, Obama is openly announcing they may need to spray the atmosphere to save us.
[02:15:33.294 --> 02:15:38.237]  Now, I already knew a hundred universities and put out literally thousands of tests.
[02:15:38.417 --> 02:15:43.281]  It's hundreds of universities, Department of Energy, all these other foreign government departments.
[02:15:43.481 --> 02:15:45.402]  Jones, I got to interrupt you.
[02:15:45.922 --> 02:15:46.763]  Turn his mic on.
[02:15:46.803 --> 02:15:47.243]  You know what?
[02:15:47.323 --> 02:15:48.144]  No, no, no, no.
[02:15:48.404 --> 02:15:49.765]  And I know Bagner is there and he's got to go.
[02:15:49.785 --> 02:15:50.025]  We can go.
[02:15:50.045 --> 02:15:51.046]  If not, we're going to take more calls.
[02:15:51.066 --> 02:15:52.547]  But, I mean, here's the issue.
[02:15:54.048 --> 02:15:57.309]  I sit there and I go, here's the CFR calling for global government.
[02:15:57.369 --> 02:16:00.290]  And then I get emails going, no, it says they're calling for global governance.
[02:16:00.690 --> 02:16:07.951]  Pull up, go to dictionary.com, just type the definition of governance.
[02:16:08.712 --> 02:16:10.532]  And it will say a system of government.
[02:16:11.272 --> 02:16:13.653]  So global government means a system of global government.
[02:16:14.013 --> 02:16:16.514]  And then I get these emails saying, no, it says governance, not government.
[02:16:16.734 --> 02:16:19.134]  I'm not playing your semantical games, man.
[02:16:19.814 --> 02:16:22.315]  I am not playing it.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:24.860]  Okay?
[02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:27.021]  I'm not playing it.
[02:16:29.021 --> 02:16:32.082]  I am not going to sit there and just say definition of governance.
[02:16:32.102 --> 02:16:32.783]  That's Wikipedia.
[02:16:32.803 --> 02:16:33.783]  I want the encyclopedia one.
[02:16:33.803 --> 02:16:34.763]  That's similar, but I want it.
[02:16:35.843 --> 02:16:38.704]  I am not going to play these games anymore with folks, okay?
[02:16:39.505 --> 02:16:43.106]  You know, we have posted the articles that no one seems to want to look at.
[02:16:43.126 --> 02:16:48.547]  They just want to speculate all day, where they admit they're doing tests to terraform and manipulate the atmosphere.
[02:16:50.408 --> 02:16:50.708]  Okay?
[02:16:52.428 --> 02:16:53.849]  We have done the studies
[02:16:55.137 --> 02:16:57.799]  They're saying, and they're doing it in a massive program.
[02:16:58.959 --> 02:16:59.920]  What's the definition of government?
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:01.981]  The act or process of power?
[02:17:02.001 --> 02:17:04.943]  Let me read it over here, it's so small on the screen.
[02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:07.164]  The act of the process of power or governing?
[02:17:07.764 --> 02:17:08.225]  Government.
[02:17:08.605 --> 02:17:09.165]  There you go!
[02:17:09.586 --> 02:17:12.227]  Okay, so every time I say that, I get nitpicks.
[02:17:12.447 --> 02:17:14.188]  And see, that's their little joke nitpicking.
[02:17:14.528 --> 02:17:19.491]  It says, international institutions and global governance program, world order in 21st century.
[02:17:21.348 --> 02:17:24.774]  And I get emails going, Alex, you lied, I can't put people on your side.
[02:17:25.275 --> 02:17:27.138]  They didn't call for global government, Alex.
[02:17:27.959 --> 02:17:29.241]  They called for global governance.
[02:17:32.632 --> 02:17:34.173]  I just, it doesn't compute.
[02:17:34.233 --> 02:17:35.894]  I can't play the game anymore.
[02:17:36.594 --> 02:17:40.116]  The point is they admit they're doing tests on manipulating the atmosphere everywhere.
[02:17:40.536 --> 02:17:43.938]  They put out government textbooks saying they're spraying the skies for our safety.
[02:17:44.618 --> 02:17:47.059]  You can Google that and pull up the textbooks for little kids.
[02:17:47.819 --> 02:17:49.060]  You can read it.
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.521]  And so here is Obama, that's what I said.
[02:17:52.402 --> 02:17:54.023]  That's what I said earlier.
[02:17:54.903 --> 02:17:57.204]  In fact, that's what I said earlier!
[02:17:57.844 --> 02:17:59.265]  That's what I said earlier!
[02:17:59.785 --> 02:18:00.806]  That's what I said!
[02:18:02.264 --> 02:18:04.085]  I feel like Howard Hughes saying, bring in the milk here.
[02:18:04.125 --> 02:18:05.865]  I mean, I'm just repeating it to these people.
[02:18:06.205 --> 02:18:21.950]  Going back a few hours ago when they walked in and handed it to me, I said, just like they've been spying for at least three decades without warrants on your phone calls, your faxes, and now in later time your emails and the rest of it, in the last 15 years, that now they want a bill to legalize it retroactively.
[02:18:22.170 --> 02:18:26.631]  Like they have a bill to turn the old military bases into FEMA camps after they already did it.
[02:18:28.103 --> 02:18:32.725]  So I made the point, I said, oh, here they are saying they want to do it after they're already doing it.
[02:18:32.985 --> 02:18:33.586]  I said that.
[02:18:33.746 --> 02:18:34.546]  Didn't I say that?
[02:18:34.846 --> 02:18:35.707]  Didn't I say that?
[02:18:35.927 --> 02:18:36.827]  Didn't I say that?
[02:18:37.008 --> 02:18:38.328]  DIDN'T I SAY THAT?!
[02:18:38.608 --> 02:18:40.249]  The chemtrails are real!
[02:18:40.269 --> 02:18:42.730]  I don't have time to play games with you anymore!
[02:18:43.451 --> 02:18:57.158]  If your jackass friends are this cowardly and this weak, and they don't know the government's coming after our guns, they've stolen $12.8 trillion, everything's going bankrupt, they're building FEMA camps, I can't help your friends!
[02:18:58.318 --> 02:19:02.660]  Who are just completely into living in denial and not seeing what's in front of their face.
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:05.001]  Now, I apologize for getting so mad.
[02:19:05.021 --> 02:19:10.062]  I've been on air too long, but Michael Bagnerich, in closing, do you want to make any comments on what I was just saying?
[02:19:10.082 --> 02:19:18.665]  Yep, the same way in my Constitution class and the people who realize it are getting fired up too.
[02:19:19.246 --> 02:19:23.227]  We are going to restore our Constitutional Republic and
[02:19:24.096 --> 02:19:33.679]  You know, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to benefit from all of our activity, and they will still be denying it, saying, well, you know, there was never any problem.
[02:19:34.379 --> 02:19:35.500]  That's not our problem.
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:39.861]  I try not to get upset at the people who don't understand.
[02:19:40.141 --> 02:19:49.224]  I just take advantage of the people who are willing to understand, that want the information, because we can do a lot more good there.
[02:19:49.264 --> 02:19:51.965]  We're not going to have everybody agree with us.
[02:19:52.712 --> 02:19:59.174]  And the good news, like I said, we had a huge rally for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.
[02:19:59.214 --> 02:20:04.916]  We've got huge rallies all over for Texas Tea Parties, the anti-tax Tea Parties.
[02:20:05.556 --> 02:20:11.798]  And another indication is that everybody seems to want to take my class on the Constitution.
[02:20:11.818 --> 02:20:12.678]  Well, that's exciting.
[02:20:13.218 --> 02:20:16.479]  Michael Magnarik, folks can find more about that at your website.
[02:20:16.499 --> 02:20:18.400]  Thank you for spending time with us and I'll talk to you soon.
[02:20:19.124 --> 02:20:19.664]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:20:37.898 --> 02:20:40.060]  You know, of course they introduce it in a way that sounds good.
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:21:01.299]  It's like HR 1444 and 1388 set up a national system to study and administer compulsory service, and then I've got the books, the documents, what they've been setting up, so I add my knowledge, and then I go, it'll be 18 to 24 for this, and a military brigade, it'll be an environmental brigade, it'll be everything I said in film six, seven years ago, because the feds were setting it up then.
[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:04.821]  You know, I don't just read the AP article with their crap.
[02:21:04.901 --> 02:21:06.321]  I then add everything I know.
[02:21:06.942 --> 02:21:08.602]  See, it's all this two-dimensional thinking.
[02:21:08.622 --> 02:21:10.343]  It's like Glenn Beck says, this is a fake FEMA camp.
[02:21:10.643 --> 02:21:11.743]  I can even predict what he's going to do.
[02:21:12.083 --> 02:21:14.424]  Instead of, oh, but look at all these other real camps.
[02:21:15.104 --> 02:21:17.785]  You see, it's the same thing with
[02:21:19.159 --> 02:21:24.902]  All of these issues, I already knew that they had NASA and the federal government admit they were spraying.
[02:21:24.922 --> 02:21:28.724]  And I've called Paul and Nemo and I've said, we've got to write more articles about this.
[02:21:28.744 --> 02:21:29.725]  We've got to get more riders.
[02:21:29.745 --> 02:21:30.585]  We're writing two or three a day.
[02:21:31.065 --> 02:21:31.786]  Doing a great job.
[02:21:32.766 --> 02:21:34.507]  Well, how do you find riders that understand this stuff?
[02:21:34.547 --> 02:21:35.268]  There's not that many.
[02:21:35.848 --> 02:21:40.573]  I guess people could give us examples and we can, you know, at InfoWars.com email us.
[02:21:41.013 --> 02:21:44.056]  I don't have enough money to hire too many more, pay a little bit or something.
[02:21:44.076 --> 02:21:47.760]  The point is, is that, because our articles tie everything together.
[02:21:47.780 --> 02:21:48.500]  You know, we'll show...
[02:21:49.451 --> 02:21:55.375]  You know, like, they can go out to one funeral place and say, oh no, we're just expanding for dying veterans here with these new graves.
[02:21:55.435 --> 02:21:58.558]  We just so happen to put four person per grave right by each other.
[02:21:58.578 --> 02:21:59.198]  It's a new system.
[02:21:59.498 --> 02:22:00.139]  Maybe that's true.
[02:22:00.399 --> 02:22:05.062]  But then we have New York State documents you can call where they're saying, we're getting ready for mass flu pandemics.
[02:22:05.403 --> 02:22:07.184]  We need you to get ready with all these mass graves.
[02:22:07.204 --> 02:22:08.805]  And then I have the Rocky Mountain News saying it.
[02:22:09.125 --> 02:22:11.347]  We're getting ready with incinerators and mass graves.
[02:22:11.607 --> 02:22:12.708]  And I give you the address.
[02:22:13.208 --> 02:22:14.769]  And so, you know, it's this nitpicking.
[02:22:15.210 --> 02:22:16.791]  It's the same thing with this Obama thing.
[02:22:17.131 --> 02:22:20.113]  I said, oh my God, here they are saying they may have to do this to save us.
[02:22:20.413 --> 02:22:27.377]  They always introduce it that way, so this is an admission that they're terraforming, that that exists, that that's going on.
[02:22:27.617 --> 02:22:31.519]  And then you go to the university documents we posted the link to, they admit they're doing it.
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:34.901]  So my point is to have them admit it in the AP was a big deal.
[02:22:35.262 --> 02:22:36.722]  And to have Obama's guy doing it.
[02:22:37.363 --> 02:22:42.566]  And when his head guy, his key science advisor says something, that's with certification.
[02:22:43.567 --> 02:22:55.730]  So yes, the Obama Administration is admitting they're doing this, and you can nitpick and say, I mean, why aren't you talking about the fact that they're talking about terraforming and saying we may have to do this, and they're not proven from their own documents they already are.
[02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:58.090]  Why isn't it about what the hell are they doing?
[02:22:58.370 --> 02:23:00.951]  Why is it all about, well, gee, I don't know.
[02:23:00.991 --> 02:23:03.891]  You know, it's kind of like, I told people how they introduced FEMA camps.
[02:23:04.932 --> 02:23:06.412]  I said, they are going to come out.
[02:23:07.982 --> 02:23:11.786]  And they are going to say, oh, it's for the homeless.
[02:23:11.866 --> 02:23:13.387]  Oh, you can't be homeless anymore.
[02:23:13.908 --> 02:23:14.748]  And there's crimes.
[02:23:14.768 --> 02:23:16.150]  We've got to search you and disarm you.
[02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:17.631]  And we're going to have a brig on there.
[02:23:18.271 --> 02:23:18.952]  But don't worry.
[02:23:19.052 --> 02:23:20.293]  And there's going to be a medical center.
[02:23:20.914 --> 02:23:21.875]  I said that for years.
[02:23:22.155 --> 02:23:23.136]  How have they now announced it?
[02:23:24.827 --> 02:23:26.708]  I mean, I said exactly how Glenn Beck would do it.
[02:23:26.928 --> 02:23:27.888]  I understand this.
[02:23:28.148 --> 02:23:31.829]  Folks, I haven't taken calls all day, hardly, because I don't want to stop.
[02:23:32.129 --> 02:23:33.089]  Because I'm passionate.
[02:23:33.250 --> 02:23:34.670]  Most hosts lean on the callers.
[02:23:34.690 --> 02:23:35.690]  They lean on guests.
[02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:37.451]  They don't want to be on air.
[02:23:37.711 --> 02:23:39.651]  They want to be out playing golf or chasing tail.
[02:23:40.032 --> 02:23:40.792]  I want to be here.
[02:23:40.832 --> 02:23:41.652]  This is what I do.
[02:23:41.672 --> 02:23:42.352]  I study them.
[02:23:42.412 --> 02:23:42.852]  I know them.
[02:23:42.912 --> 02:23:43.593]  I know the enemy.
[02:23:43.913 --> 02:23:44.893]  I understand what they're doing.
[02:23:44.913 --> 02:23:46.173]  They're going to kill our asses.
[02:23:46.353 --> 02:23:47.774]  These people mean business!
[02:23:49.585 --> 02:23:51.309]  These people mean business, man!
[02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:52.872]  My whole life's on the line with this!
[02:23:53.213 --> 02:23:55.298]  And you call into the show nitpicking!
[02:23:58.973 --> 02:24:01.634]  I mean, what I did in the interest of time was I condensed it all together.
[02:24:01.694 --> 02:24:04.655]  I said, yes, now they're introducing how we need it.
[02:24:04.696 --> 02:24:05.576]  That's how they always do it.
[02:24:05.716 --> 02:24:08.017]  After they've already been doing it, we have the articles.
[02:24:08.057 --> 02:24:11.198]  Here's the name of the articles up on PrisonPlanet.com where they admit they're doing.
[02:24:11.619 --> 02:24:15.920]  So I made that all perfectly clear without adding a bunch of tremulous hesitation.
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:19.122]  I mean, I don't know who we need.
[02:24:20.042 --> 02:24:26.045]  I mean, like you said, seven years ago, I make a film, Road to Tyranny, showing you the documents where they say we're all terrorists, and now it's all big news everywhere.
[02:24:26.245 --> 02:24:32.527]  I broke the MIAC report, and I had my own people going, I don't see Ron Paul in there, and he's not in there, and I'm like, he's on page eight!
[02:24:33.127 --> 02:24:34.148]  He's on page eight!
[02:24:35.028 --> 02:24:37.889]  I started screaming at them, you know, I can't handle this stuff, man!
[02:24:38.289 --> 02:24:40.390]  I know how this works, this is what I do!
[02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:44.352]  I've interviewed thousands of experts, I do this stuff 18 hours a day!
[02:24:44.372 --> 02:24:46.493]  I don't have time for your crap anymore!
[02:24:47.313 --> 02:24:47.813]  And you know what?
[02:24:47.833 --> 02:24:48.793]  You can do a better job.
[02:24:48.834 --> 02:24:50.114]  Get your own radio show.
[02:24:50.394 --> 02:24:51.434]  Get it there in Florida.
[02:24:51.474 --> 02:24:52.215]  Go out and do it.
[02:24:52.415 --> 02:24:54.175]  Man, I didn't claim to have all the answers.
[02:24:55.476 --> 02:24:59.277]  But see, instead it's going to be about, oh, Obama just says they may terraform.
[02:25:00.337 --> 02:25:02.278]  I told you they admit they're already doing it.
[02:25:02.378 --> 02:25:03.158]  My God.
[02:25:03.878 --> 02:25:05.039]  My God.
[02:25:05.919 --> 02:25:09.960]  I guess everything's okay, Bernus, because yeah, the camps are real, but, you know, they're only for our safety.
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:11.260]  Well, I don't think everything's okay.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:12.641]  I mean, who are these timid people?
[02:25:13.527 --> 02:25:20.308]  Well, then, Alex, I'm listening right now, and he said they're doing it, but Obama just says they may have to.
[02:25:20.448 --> 02:25:21.189]  Let's be honest.
[02:25:21.229 --> 02:25:22.989]  The point is they're saying it's real!
[02:25:23.189 --> 02:25:29.410]  The point is they're saying they can manipulate the atmosphere, spraying aerosols, that they're doing right now!
[02:25:29.931 --> 02:25:32.391]  The point is they admit the frickin' thing's real!
[02:25:33.091 --> 02:25:41.093]  God, you people have been conditioned from birth to not have any connection to reality, to not see right through things, to not go with it!
[02:25:42.014 --> 02:25:45.958]  I mean, how is it bizarre for me to say they're admitting they have chemtrails, is my point?
[02:25:46.159 --> 02:25:47.760]  They're admitting they have chemtrails!
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:49.582]  They're admitting they have chemtrails!
[02:25:49.742 --> 02:25:51.424]  They're admitting they have chemtrails!
[02:25:52.608 --> 02:25:54.589]  THEY'RE SPRAYING US IN A SECRET PROGRAM!
[02:25:54.729 --> 02:25:55.309]  GOD!
[02:25:55.729 --> 02:25:57.670]  I'm sorry, go ahead Burmus, give us the latest info.
[02:25:57.710 --> 02:26:01.311]  Yeah, you know, um, I got the second half of the document right here, here's page 120.
[02:26:02.692 --> 02:26:05.273]  It's all about internet and how we're bad, we're terrorists, Alex.
[02:26:05.553 --> 02:26:13.616]  Internet technology has emerged as the preferred medium for extremist communication and is increasingly being exploited to assist terrorists in achieving their goals.
[02:26:13.916 --> 02:26:17.297]  It's used to recruit and radicalize, uh, supportive terrorist activities.
[02:26:17.317 --> 02:26:20.518]  So you're saying terrorist and then radical and then extremist and they can call me an extremist.
[02:26:20.558 --> 02:26:22.039]  It's all about murder and death.
[02:26:22.259 --> 02:26:22.959]  And how dare they?
[02:26:23.019 --> 02:26:31.182]  These groups solicit funds on their websites through donations as well as the sales of various items including publications, audio and visual media.
[02:26:31.202 --> 02:26:32.143]  Here's where it gets great.
[02:26:32.443 --> 02:26:41.446]  Extremist groups also actively use web forums, blogs, social networking sites such as YouTube, MySpace, Google Video and of course Twitter.
[02:26:42.369 --> 02:26:43.250]  Oh my God!
[02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:44.772]  And then, here's even better.
[02:26:45.172 --> 02:26:53.342]  On the bottom, they say Twitter was used as a counter-surveillance command and control and the movement of tool-buy activists at the Republican National Convention.
[02:26:53.362 --> 02:26:54.764]  You know where this article comes out of?
[02:26:55.445 --> 02:26:55.805]  Sample.
[02:26:56.306 --> 02:26:59.630]  Al-Qaeda-like mobile discussions and potential creative uses.
[02:26:59.830 --> 02:27:03.571]  So if you're protesting the Republican National Party... It's Al-Qaeda-like!
[02:27:03.591 --> 02:27:04.412]  You're Al-Qaeda, yeah.
[02:27:04.532 --> 02:27:07.633]  Well, see, but see, and they'll also go, well, it just mixes them in.
[02:27:07.653 --> 02:27:08.973]  They're not saying they're Al-Qaeda.
[02:27:09.153 --> 02:27:10.714]  They just say it's Al-Qaeda-like.
[02:27:10.774 --> 02:27:13.615]  I mean, you said they were equating protesters with Al-Qaeda.
[02:27:13.835 --> 02:27:15.315]  They just said Al-Qaeda-like.
[02:27:15.395 --> 02:27:17.916]  I don't think that really means they're equating them with them.
[02:27:18.196 --> 02:27:19.977]  I don't think the government's really bad.
[02:27:20.617 --> 02:27:21.497]  I don't believe it.
[02:27:22.218 --> 02:27:22.778]  I don't know.
[02:27:23.058 --> 02:27:27.159]  Yeah, like you said, the general populace is so ignorant and mesmerized.
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:28.160]  Let me give you an example.
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:35.142]  One of my really good friends back in New York, he does a financial blog for one of the bigger, I'm not going to say the company, but he does a big financial blog.
[02:27:35.162 --> 02:27:36.243]  Better not, they're not kidding.
[02:27:36.263 --> 02:27:37.003]  We're so free.
[02:27:37.023 --> 02:27:39.524]  So I said to him, what do you think about this new global currency?
[02:27:39.924 --> 02:27:41.065]  He's like, what are you talking about?
[02:27:41.105 --> 02:27:44.648]  And I sent him the article out of the Telegraph with the IMF talking about it.
[02:27:44.688 --> 02:27:48.831]  But let me guess, he had been preconditioned it didn't exist, so he couldn't see the article?
[02:27:49.031 --> 02:27:50.673]  No, he figured it out, kind of.
[02:27:50.993 --> 02:27:51.333]  Kind of.
[02:27:51.373 --> 02:27:53.535]  Like, he looked at it, he said, well, where is this global currency?
[02:27:53.555 --> 02:27:56.978]  And I said, look, this is called... It's monetized at the top, he couldn't understand that.
[02:27:56.998 --> 02:27:58.219]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:27:58.259 --> 02:28:00.380]  And then I explained to him, hey, look what just went down at the G20.
[02:28:01.261 --> 02:28:01.761]  We're good to go.
[02:28:19.928 --> 02:28:23.450]  I showed him the MIAC report, Alex, and he couldn't understand why it was bad.
[02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:27.032]  And I literally had to break down the first page and say, all right, well, here's a lie.
[02:28:27.272 --> 02:28:27.892]  Here's another lie.
[02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:28.712]  Here's the next lie.
[02:28:28.872 --> 02:28:29.913]  You know, these are all government operations.
[02:28:29.953 --> 02:28:30.533]  They're like children.
[02:28:30.573 --> 02:28:34.315]  They just think the government likes them and everything's like, ahhh.
[02:28:34.775 --> 02:28:35.676]  They have no idea.
[02:28:35.696 --> 02:28:37.637]  This is the people that murdered half the planet.
[02:28:39.137 --> 02:28:41.819]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry, 200 million wasn't half the planet.
[02:28:43.972 --> 02:28:44.853]  I'm disgusted, Alex.
[02:28:44.893 --> 02:28:47.315]  I mean, I've got another hundred pages to go through on this thing.
[02:28:47.335 --> 02:28:47.916]  Hey, you know what?
[02:28:47.956 --> 02:28:48.876]  That doesn't exist.
[02:28:48.916 --> 02:28:50.117]  That paper doesn't exist.
[02:28:50.278 --> 02:28:51.078]  I want you to prove.
[02:28:52.379 --> 02:28:53.821]  Alex made up the MIAC.
[02:28:53.861 --> 02:28:56.843]  You know, for the people at PrisonPlanet.TV, look at this document.
[02:28:56.883 --> 02:28:58.365]  Look what I am holding in my hands.
[02:28:58.405 --> 02:29:01.627]  This is, I mean, this is unbelievable!
[02:29:01.647 --> 02:29:03.309]  Well, that's an internal one.
[02:29:03.549 --> 02:29:05.591]  That's why it says they're surveilling all those people.
[02:29:05.831 --> 02:29:07.632]  The key is, all those people are being surveilled.
[02:29:07.673 --> 02:29:08.733]  I'd love to get the Texas one.
[02:29:09.854 --> 02:29:12.435]  I've been sent the short Texas ones and posted them, but I haven't got them.
[02:29:12.455 --> 02:29:13.275]  Well, you called it, Alex.
[02:29:13.315 --> 02:29:14.896]  You said these were going out all over the country.
[02:29:14.916 --> 02:29:15.636]  They obviously are.
[02:29:15.656 --> 02:29:16.357]  Well, I know they are.
[02:29:16.397 --> 02:29:17.437]  It's all federally written.
[02:29:17.457 --> 02:29:18.017]  They admit that.
[02:29:18.077 --> 02:29:18.297]  Yes.
[02:29:18.637 --> 02:29:18.838]  Yes.
[02:29:18.978 --> 02:29:19.598]  So, you know.
[02:29:19.618 --> 02:29:20.458]  I didn't call it.
[02:29:20.498 --> 02:29:22.359]  They admit that these reports are federally written.
[02:29:22.659 --> 02:29:24.360]  Well, I just commend you.
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:25.460]  I won't see proof!
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:27.301]  I won't see proof!
[02:29:27.401 --> 02:29:28.941]  Okay, go Google the articles.
[02:29:28.961 --> 02:29:32.283]  You got the governor saying the feds wrote this and the Kansas City Star.
[02:29:32.323 --> 02:29:35.724]  It's not my job to sit there and hand-feed you everything, okay?
[02:29:37.823 --> 02:29:40.704]  I'm with you Alex, I'm just trying to do the right thing and put this out there to people.
[02:29:40.724 --> 02:29:41.584]  It makes me sick.
[02:29:41.604 --> 02:29:44.285]  And you know, if people can do a better job, please help us.
[02:29:44.425 --> 02:29:46.986]  You know, we got the government.
[02:29:47.006 --> 02:29:49.427]  I am sick and tired of people calling me, telling me what I need to do.
[02:29:49.867 --> 02:29:55.228]  Well you, Alex, especially being here, you know, seeing how much you work, I mean you are a work horse.
[02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:57.489]  I couldn't work as much as this guy, I'll tell you that right now.
[02:29:57.569 --> 02:29:58.569]  I need to quit.
[02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:59.670]  No, you don't need to quit.
[02:30:00.370 --> 02:30:03.731]  You, Alex, you know it's gotten to the point where I know it's life and death.
[02:30:03.751 --> 02:30:04.672]  I mean, you can't get out of this.
[02:30:05.132 --> 02:30:07.733]  There's only one way to make it out of here, and that's going through these sons of bitches.
[02:30:07.793 --> 02:30:08.293]  Well, you know what?
[02:30:08.373 --> 02:30:10.294]  I want to tell people when they... I mean, let me tell you something, folks.
[02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:15.756]  They plan to take you in the final equation after a bunch of stage crises and getting you used to riots and problems down the road.
[02:30:15.936 --> 02:30:17.736]  They plan to blow your frickin' head off, okay?
[02:30:18.056 --> 02:30:20.557]  And, you know, you can suck your thumb all day and say, I'm making that up.
[02:30:20.717 --> 02:30:22.038]  Hey, fine, more power to you.
[02:30:22.318 --> 02:30:27.300]  But at least when it gets worse and worse and I get proven right on the rest of the stuff, get up off your fat asses.
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:31.203]  Get up off your big, fat, and you can be skinny.
[02:30:31.243 --> 02:30:32.384]  I'm not bashing fat people.
[02:30:32.684 --> 02:30:33.344]  I'm a little chubby.
[02:30:33.645 --> 02:30:35.306]  The point is, I mean, your soul's fat.
[02:30:35.346 --> 02:30:37.308]  You're slovenly and you're weak.
[02:30:38.108 --> 02:30:38.469]  Okay?
[02:30:38.709 --> 02:30:42.412]  I mean, if you can't see what's going on, you've got a big problem.
[02:30:45.334 --> 02:30:45.795]  Just wait.
[02:30:46.235 --> 02:30:46.775]  Just go ahead.
[02:30:47.056 --> 02:30:47.596]  Go ahead, Burness.
[02:30:47.636 --> 02:30:48.176]  I want to take calls.
[02:30:48.217 --> 02:30:48.477]  Go ahead.
[02:30:49.031 --> 02:30:50.452]  All right, you know, I said you got more there.
[02:30:50.472 --> 02:30:52.554]  I mean, yeah, you can go through this whole thing.
[02:30:52.594 --> 02:30:54.556]  I mean, everything is considered terrorism.
[02:30:54.716 --> 02:30:58.339]  And look at your whole first hour and they got Kaiser on second hour.
[02:30:58.419 --> 02:30:59.219]  Kaiser on the second hour.
[02:30:59.239 --> 02:31:00.280]  I'm going to be going over this.
[02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:01.761]  You need to cover that the whole first hour.
[02:31:01.781 --> 02:31:02.922]  The whole first hour is going to be.
[02:31:02.942 --> 02:31:05.604]  And they got Kaiser on and I'll call in with the Beck thing after that.
[02:31:05.965 --> 02:31:07.026]  We got a big show tonight Alex.
[02:31:07.066 --> 02:31:10.508]  I got attacked for saying he was a government agent and he was going to stab us in the back.
[02:31:10.528 --> 02:31:11.849]  And then now it was proven right.
[02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:13.150]  Exactly as I said.
[02:31:13.191 --> 02:31:15.072]  I mean, do you people have any respect for me?
[02:31:15.092 --> 02:31:16.974]  Do you have any respect for me?
[02:31:17.714 --> 02:31:19.657]  Or is it just all, we don't believe Alex?
[02:31:21.659 --> 02:31:24.783]  Well, you know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, but that's all that matters.
[02:31:24.803 --> 02:31:27.366]  No, that guy sounded apologetic and nice, and that's why it made me so mad.
[02:31:27.906 --> 02:31:30.670]  He's like, I'm sorry, but I can't pour people at your show, and you're blah blah blah.
[02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:34.494]  I said, hey, this article right here, and by the way, they admit it.
[02:31:34.514 --> 02:31:36.156]  The point is, they're admitting the chemtrails.
[02:31:37.177 --> 02:31:37.798]  That's my point.
[02:31:37.998 --> 02:31:41.540]  Instead of like inventing that I'm like... It's just so nitpicky, man.
[02:31:42.381 --> 02:31:44.642]  It drives me insane.
[02:31:44.682 --> 02:31:46.883]  The point is they're spraying us, okay?
[02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:48.985]  And they're admitting that they're doing it.
[02:31:49.625 --> 02:31:51.887]  And he goes, no, they're saying they're looking at it!
[02:31:53.167 --> 02:31:55.269]  The point is they're admitting it's real and rolling it out.
[02:31:55.309 --> 02:31:56.750]  The issue is that they're rolling it out.
[02:31:59.437 --> 02:31:59.937]  My God.
[02:32:00.017 --> 02:32:04.401]  And they're not going to have arguments all day with people about their, you know, well there is a law I've got to take vaccines.
[02:32:04.961 --> 02:32:09.344]  And I've got to explain to them that there's... Oh, right there it says, you know, terrorists won't take shots.
[02:32:09.364 --> 02:32:12.707]  You know what, as soon as you said it I was just pulling out a random page.
[02:32:12.727 --> 02:32:13.487]  I can't handle it anymore.
[02:32:13.527 --> 02:32:15.869]  It's public health and health care part of the terrorism.
[02:32:16.329 --> 02:32:17.430]  So what do the terrorists believe in?
[02:32:17.470 --> 02:32:18.110]  Well, let's see.
[02:32:18.211 --> 02:32:19.191]  Sector list criteria.
[02:32:19.572 --> 02:32:26.176]  Primary HHS owned or managed pharmaceutical and medical equipment stockpile sites centered for disease control.
[02:32:26.416 --> 02:32:27.978]  This is forced inoculation crap.
[02:32:28.618 --> 02:32:30.800]  That's exactly what this is, oh my god.
[02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:32.741]  I mean, I gotta sit down with this guy.
[02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:38.745]  I mean, folks, it's not easy going through this with their doublespeak, too, because everything's good for you.
[02:32:38.785 --> 02:32:40.566]  Everybody knows I made up the MIAC report.
[02:32:40.586 --> 02:32:41.687]  I'm still being accused of that.
[02:32:42.348 --> 02:32:43.108]  And that was a big thing.
[02:32:43.128 --> 02:32:45.750]  A lot of people really said that that was a totally fair report.
[02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:47.111]  It's all still there.
[02:32:47.131 --> 02:32:49.613]  No, I made it up, they say.
[02:32:49.893 --> 02:32:51.614]  And, you know, again, I covered this on my show.
[02:32:51.634 --> 02:32:52.135]  I had someone call me.
[02:32:52.155 --> 02:32:52.495]  It doesn't matter.
[02:32:52.515 --> 02:32:53.996]  The head of the MIAC thing just resigned.
[02:32:54.356 --> 02:32:55.337]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:32:56.104 --> 02:32:56.684]  Doesn't exist.
[02:32:57.305 --> 02:32:57.845]  Doesn't exist.
[02:32:57.885 --> 02:33:02.548]  Doesn't matter that I get calls that people are getting pulled over in Los Angeles County for having Ron Paul away bumper stickers.
[02:33:02.568 --> 02:33:03.949]  No, there's video of it in Las Vegas.
[02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:06.750]  You know, we're all just terrorists, Alex.
[02:33:06.770 --> 02:33:07.951]  We should just give in and bow down.
[02:33:07.971 --> 02:33:09.672]  But, you know... But, I mean, look, look, look.
[02:33:10.192 --> 02:33:12.374]  Let's say 90% of what I'm saying is accurate.
[02:33:12.394 --> 02:33:13.094]  And really, it's like 110.
[02:33:13.654 --> 02:33:15.075]  It's worse than what I'm saying.
[02:33:15.636 --> 02:33:19.538]  You know, um... It's worse than what I'm saying.
[02:33:20.458 --> 02:33:22.199]  And... But, I mean, let's just say 10% was true.
[02:33:23.379 --> 02:33:24.019]  Hypothetically.
[02:33:24.099 --> 02:33:25.340]  I mean, is that not bad?
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:27.101]  I mean, were we not screwed with that?
[02:33:29.882 --> 02:33:30.762]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:33:30.782 --> 02:33:33.384]  I mean, the government's admitting, for your safety, we're going to chemtrail you.
[02:33:34.524 --> 02:33:35.084]  Oh, Jesus.
[02:33:35.565 --> 02:33:36.445]  That's what this means.
[02:33:36.465 --> 02:33:37.505]  See, I know their language.
[02:33:37.765 --> 02:33:41.907]  But they say, oh, we're looking at spraying the atmosphere with particulates to save you.
[02:33:42.207 --> 02:33:46.469]  I know they've already admitted it in a bunch of government documents, so the point is they're rolling it out is the big issue.
[02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:48.790]  And so I tell you what the meaning of it is.
[02:33:48.810 --> 02:33:49.711]  It's like a translator.
[02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:57.703]  The President's new science advisor said Wednesday that global warming is so dire that the Obama administration is discussing radical technologies to cool Earth's air.
[02:33:58.464 --> 02:34:05.807]  John Holdren told the Associated Press in his interview since the first interview being confirmed last month that the idea of geoengineering the climate is being discussed.
[02:34:06.447 --> 02:34:09.228]  See, chemtrails are so big in his first interview, this is what he says.
[02:34:09.908 --> 02:34:11.769]  But see, being discussed, they're testing it.
[02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:13.429]  When you go read the science, it's all testing.
[02:34:13.449 --> 02:34:14.670]  This is all just testing.
[02:34:15.543 --> 02:34:16.123]  Just like U.S.
[02:34:16.143 --> 02:34:27.247]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Section 1,528, Paragraph B says, oh, well, we can use chemical, biological, or radiologicals on you without your consent unless it's part of law enforcement or testing.
[02:34:28.347 --> 02:34:29.308]  Then we don't have to tell you.
[02:34:29.528 --> 02:34:35.310]  And then there's big law firms reporting on them that it says that, and people say, oh, it doesn't really, you're reading that wrong.
[02:34:35.350 --> 02:34:36.870]  Okay, whatever, Mac.
[02:34:41.952 --> 02:34:42.532]  Good God.
[02:34:44.741 --> 02:34:46.902]  Tinker with climate is just his personal view.
[02:34:46.943 --> 02:34:49.985]  However, he went on to say that he raised it in administration discussions.
[02:34:53.007 --> 02:34:55.348]  He's far from alone in talking geoengineering.
[02:34:55.989 --> 02:35:02.473]  The National Academy of Sciences is making climate tinkering the subject of its first workshop in the multi-discipline climate challenges program.
[02:35:02.493 --> 02:35:04.274]  The British Parliament has also discussed the idea.
[02:35:04.554 --> 02:35:06.516]  See, they're now rolling it out to you folks.
[02:35:07.523 --> 02:35:17.049]  The American Meteorological Society is crafting a policy statement on geoengineering that says it is prudent to consider geoengineering potential to understand its limits and to avoid rash deployment.
[02:35:20.372 --> 02:35:22.573]  So the point is they're introducing this to the slaves.
[02:35:22.853 --> 02:35:27.096]  And then I went on to say that we have articles where they're admitting it.
[02:35:27.136 --> 02:35:27.636]  You can go read them.
[02:35:27.676 --> 02:35:28.897]  In fact, let me see if Watson has them.
[02:35:28.917 --> 02:35:30.238]  Okay, I promise to go to your calls.
[02:35:30.258 --> 02:35:31.059]  I'm just out of control.
[02:35:31.719 --> 02:35:33.160]  Linda in California, you're on the air.
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:33.761]  Thanks for holding.
[02:35:35.722 --> 02:35:36.062]  Hi.
[02:35:36.642 --> 02:35:36.803]  Hi.
[02:35:37.662 --> 02:35:38.663]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:35:38.723 --> 02:35:40.143]  Sorry you had to hear that rant, Linda.
[02:35:40.664 --> 02:35:41.524]  Oh no, you know what?
[02:35:42.084 --> 02:35:43.645]  I'm your male counterpart.
[02:35:45.026 --> 02:35:52.910]  I get really frustrated at people that attack you without first doing their homework and checking the information.
[02:35:53.410 --> 02:36:01.654]  You know, I have the computer up and I'm listening to your show either on the phone or I'm listening online and then I'll go and do what you say to do, trust.
[02:36:02.216 --> 02:36:03.117]  But verify!
[02:36:03.197 --> 02:36:05.418]  Look at the information!
[02:36:05.518 --> 02:36:05.999]  Google!
[02:36:06.019 --> 02:36:12.903]  You know, we have access to more information now with the Internet, and people are more lazy.
[02:36:13.383 --> 02:36:14.044]  It's the same thing.
[02:36:14.064 --> 02:36:22.569]  And let me ask you, because I really respect you and what you do, your perspective from a believer in Jesus, that they just want to stand down.
[02:36:22.589 --> 02:36:23.170]  And I said,
[02:36:23.928 --> 02:36:25.889]  Have you studied what the Word says?
[02:36:26.009 --> 02:36:35.452]  You can fully line up where we are right now in the Bible, and that it says that, and I had called Jason the other night, that kingdom versus kingdom.
[02:36:35.472 --> 02:36:37.193]  We've had nations against nations.
[02:36:37.253 --> 02:36:40.494]  We're kingdom of light versus kingdom of darkness.
[02:36:40.874 --> 02:36:45.456]  We have an obligation to lay down our life for the brethren, and it doesn't mean just
[02:36:45.956 --> 02:36:47.437]  Stand in a firing squad.
[02:36:47.817 --> 02:36:51.819]  Lay down your life, not caring what other people think, but getting the truth to them.
[02:36:52.279 --> 02:36:56.120]  I'll roll down my window at an intersection and go, have you heard of the New World Order?
[02:36:56.300 --> 02:36:57.401]  Go to end the war.
[02:36:57.521 --> 02:36:58.621]  I pass out flyers.
[02:36:58.741 --> 02:37:00.562]  I call the government.
[02:37:00.762 --> 02:37:02.203]  I do email campaigns.
[02:37:02.703 --> 02:37:04.544]  We have an obligation.
[02:37:06.192 --> 02:37:11.056]  To tell them that judgment, the sword is coming in the book of Ezekiel.
[02:37:11.076 --> 02:37:16.460]  Exactly, and I mean regardless of its... We don't mourn the people, their blood's on our hands.
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:20.223]  We have a duty to our nation.
[02:37:21.351 --> 02:37:24.213]  I totally hear you and I agree with you.
[02:37:42.166 --> 02:38:04.986]  And, you know, all the disciples being killed or put in prison, Jesus being killed for not doing what government said, the prophets being killed, it, you know, not doing what the king says, being put in the fiery furnace of the lion's den, Moses not doing what Pharaoh said, but according to them, no, Romans 13, Moses should have knelt down, you know, before the Pharaoh, Ramses, and should have licked his boots.
[02:38:05.765 --> 02:38:21.510]  You know, because, and that's why the government finances Romans 13, so whether it's the end of the world or not, we have a duty, and if people really had Christ in their heart, if they really had Yahweh in their heart, they would be uncontrollably fighting the New World Order, who's running child kidnapping rings and everything else.
[02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:26.892]  I mean, I just rage against them wanting to fight them and stop them, and I can't control myself wanting to resist them.
[02:38:27.512 --> 02:38:30.153]  And then people are like, oh, praise God, it's almost the end.
[02:38:30.533 --> 02:38:32.353]  I'll be teleported out of here soon.
[02:38:32.693 --> 02:38:33.414]  What a cop-out.
[02:38:33.434 --> 02:38:34.934]  Good to hear from you, Linda.
[02:38:35.434 --> 02:38:37.275]  Leanne in Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:38:37.315 --> 02:38:38.095]  Go ahead, Leanne.
[02:38:39.015 --> 02:38:40.035]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[02:38:40.255 --> 02:38:45.457]  I have a question, a little bit of information, and a request of you.
[02:38:45.477 --> 02:38:52.739]  First off, have you ever read or are you familiar with a book called The Red Amendment by L.B.
[02:38:52.819 --> 02:38:53.119]  Bush?
[02:38:56.517 --> 02:38:57.317]  Alright.
[02:38:58.157 --> 02:39:02.978]  If I may, I'd like to read just a little bit of a paragraph from the preface.
[02:39:04.019 --> 02:39:11.040]  It says that you will find that you have not been living under the true Constitution that was established by the Founding Fathers.
[02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:16.981]  You will find that you have been removed from your lawful country under the semblance of law.
[02:39:17.581 --> 02:39:21.862]  Hence, you will find you are not living in a free state as you have been told.
[02:39:22.540 --> 02:39:26.203]  You will find out that you are living under dictatorial rule.
[02:39:26.223 --> 02:39:31.048]  All these facts will be clearly demonstrated with legal reference and so on.
[02:39:31.989 --> 02:39:35.072]  My request, would you please have L.B.
[02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:37.073]  Bork on your show?
[02:39:38.455 --> 02:39:42.498]  And you can find him at pacinlaw.org.
[02:39:43.139 --> 02:39:47.143]  PAC is P-A-C, stands for People Awareness Coalition.
[02:39:47.984 --> 02:39:52.366]  So that would be P-A-C-I-N-L-A-W dot org.
[02:39:52.566 --> 02:39:53.506]  Alright, we'll do this.
[02:39:53.586 --> 02:39:54.267]  Send me the info.
[02:39:54.287 --> 02:39:55.087]  I need to look over it.
[02:39:55.307 --> 02:39:57.788]  I'm not saying this person's a legal quack.
[02:39:57.948 --> 02:39:59.229]  I'm not familiar with them.
[02:39:59.609 --> 02:40:02.190]  And I have to specifically look at what they're talking about myself.
[02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:04.631]  But I mean, you seem to think it's pretty convincing.
[02:40:05.351 --> 02:40:06.832]  What is he specifically talking about?
[02:40:06.872 --> 02:40:09.713]  How we're under the corporate district of Columbia?
[02:40:10.133 --> 02:40:11.314]  And after the Civil War?
[02:40:11.494 --> 02:40:12.714]  Or what is he claiming?
[02:40:13.194 --> 02:40:15.755]  He goes into all of it.
[02:40:17.745 --> 02:40:19.006]  It's a treaty.
[02:40:21.267 --> 02:40:30.692]  What he says is that... You're talking about the treaty included in the late 1790s between the United States and the Queen or the King?
[02:40:31.072 --> 02:40:32.633]  It has regard to the 14th Amendment.
[02:40:35.913 --> 02:40:37.294]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:40:37.314 --> 02:40:38.034]  That's what I figured.
[02:40:38.074 --> 02:40:39.696]  Well, that's got a lot of truth to it.
[02:40:40.856 --> 02:40:46.060]  I mean, they did conclude treaties of truce with the Queen and the King after the war.
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:47.601]  People misconstrued that as a sell-out.
[02:40:47.621 --> 02:40:48.281]  It really wasn't.
[02:40:48.602 --> 02:40:51.483]  But certainly, yeah, what happened after the Civil War is real.
[02:40:51.744 --> 02:40:52.464]  We'll look into that.
[02:40:52.504 --> 02:40:53.645]  Thanks for holding to bring that up.
[02:40:53.685 --> 02:40:54.726]  I need to get to everybody else here.
[02:40:55.086 --> 02:40:55.987]  Robert in Texas.
[02:40:56.047 --> 02:40:56.887]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:40:56.907 --> 02:40:59.269]  Hi, Alex.
[02:40:59.809 --> 02:41:00.029]  Hi.
[02:41:00.610 --> 02:41:00.990]  You hear me?
[02:41:01.570 --> 02:41:02.231]  Yes, sir, I do.
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:04.201]  Okay, cool.
[02:41:04.541 --> 02:41:10.045]  Well, first off, I want to say that me and my beautiful girlfriend, Sarah, are huge fans of your show.
[02:41:10.065 --> 02:41:14.468]  We just got done watching your Bohemian Grove film.
[02:41:14.488 --> 02:41:15.549]  It creeped her out a lot.
[02:41:15.589 --> 02:41:16.730]  It creeped me out a lot, too.
[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:19.712]  But anyway, let me get to my point.
[02:41:20.472 --> 02:41:24.875]  First, I have a question, and then I have a little bit of information I wanted to share with you.
[02:41:25.436 --> 02:41:26.356]  The question was,
[02:41:29.758 --> 02:41:35.548]  My girlfriend and I have noticed these weird polls that they're putting up, up and down I-35.
[02:41:36.069 --> 02:41:37.852]  We live down here in Kyle, just south of you.
[02:41:38.786 --> 02:41:45.209]  And, um, they have these cameras on them and these like weird little dishes, uh, like little square plates on them.
[02:41:45.609 --> 02:41:46.150]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:41:46.210 --> 02:41:54.974]  They've admitted that it's now Homeland Security and, oh, all the cameras will now be used to watch you and the gunshot detectors, they really are microphones that listen to you.
[02:41:54.994 --> 02:42:00.577]  I mean, I remember in 1998 they put wireless microphones, shotgun mics, all over Austin.
[02:42:01.117 --> 02:42:02.658]  And the company's website... And they can see it into your car?
[02:42:04.262 --> 02:42:06.063]  No, but you can hear it a couple hundred yards away.
[02:42:06.103 --> 02:42:07.184]  That was the whole demonstration.
[02:42:07.444 --> 02:42:08.805]  They call them gunshot detectors.
[02:42:09.245 --> 02:42:11.286]  And then now they're announcing everywhere these are going up.
[02:42:11.346 --> 02:42:25.194]  It's all Pentagon-controlled all over the country, but most of these cameras with a resolution are hooked into license plate reading software, and then that goes into the threat integration fusion centers put in by FEMA, and then they put army liaisons in with the police.
[02:42:25.635 --> 02:42:26.375]  I mean, it's hellish.
[02:42:26.475 --> 02:42:29.517]  It's the same system they've got to control Iraq.
[02:42:30.057 --> 02:42:33.558]  In fact, they bragged in MIT Magazine about it a few years ago.
[02:42:33.618 --> 02:42:36.079]  I was in a restaurant and saw a copy at the bar and was reading it.
[02:42:36.099 --> 02:42:41.501]  I already knew about it from other articles, but it was all there, bragging about how it's a surveillance grid.
[02:42:42.341 --> 02:42:48.703]  Well, yeah, I looked it up because we see them go up and a lot of them are brand new.
[02:42:48.743 --> 02:42:49.683]  They're all up and down 35.
[02:42:49.783 --> 02:42:52.384]  And I figured you'd probably know because you're up in Austin.
[02:42:52.404 --> 02:42:54.805]  Well, tell us what you found out about the particular unit you're looking at.
[02:42:55.518 --> 02:42:55.918]  Okay.
[02:42:56.959 --> 02:42:58.040]  There's a website.
[02:42:58.060 --> 02:43:07.427]  This is really, really, really big, I think, personally, because this kind of technology, there's a lot of talk around it, what people call conspiracies and whatnot.
[02:43:07.768 --> 02:43:10.550]  But there's a site that's called Powercast.com.
[02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:11.411]  I don't know if you've heard of it.
[02:43:11.431 --> 02:43:12.031]  Have you heard of that?
[02:43:12.351 --> 02:43:13.272]  Powercast?
[02:43:14.253 --> 02:43:15.674]  Powercast.com.
[02:43:15.734 --> 02:43:18.116]  Boy, this is a big... If you haven't heard of this, you're going to love this.
[02:43:19.313 --> 02:43:20.614]  Just go there, check it out.
[02:43:20.695 --> 02:43:24.699]  It's basically wireless electricity.
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:34.091]  If you know about Nikola Tesla, which I'm sure you do, and the listeners, if you know about Nikola Tesla, how JP Morgan shut him down way back when.
[02:43:34.111 --> 02:43:37.996]  Is this specifically, I mean, is this specifically dealing with these cameras?
[02:43:39.079 --> 02:43:43.341]  No, it has to do with RFID technology also.
[02:43:43.801 --> 02:43:47.723]  Is this specifically with these cameras?
[02:43:48.183 --> 02:43:49.524]  No, those cameras was a separate thing.
[02:43:49.544 --> 02:43:52.125]  That was a question I was asking because I didn't know about those.
[02:43:52.606 --> 02:43:53.826]  I doubt those are beamed.
[02:43:54.707 --> 02:43:55.587]  No, no, no.
[02:43:55.627 --> 02:43:56.327]  That was separate.
[02:43:56.387 --> 02:43:57.508]  I was just asking about those.
[02:43:57.628 --> 02:43:59.089]  I don't know about those cameras.
[02:43:59.349 --> 02:44:01.970]  I didn't know what they were and I didn't find any information about them.
[02:44:02.050 --> 02:44:05.632]  It's a wireless unit to a main station where they beam the signal.
[02:44:06.792 --> 02:44:08.717]  So it's not beaming power, it's beaming the signal.
[02:44:09.138 --> 02:44:12.025]  But you can with lasers like beam computer data.
[02:44:12.827 --> 02:44:19.908]  Well, this Powercast website, they claim that it's basically broadcast.
[02:44:19.988 --> 02:44:21.429]  It's energy broadcast.
[02:44:21.529 --> 02:44:22.809]  It's not even supposed to be around.
[02:44:22.849 --> 02:44:24.649]  This technology is not supposed to be around.
[02:44:25.169 --> 02:44:26.890]  And it's there if you go to it.
[02:44:27.250 --> 02:44:28.690]  And you know what's really creepy, Alex?
[02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:37.572]  If you look at the front page, you'll see that the way they have it all decorated, there's a guy, it shows a guy with a gun on there, you know, in camo, and all suited up.
[02:44:37.612 --> 02:44:40.353]  And then on the right, it shows different features of it.
[02:44:40.433 --> 02:44:41.913]  And one of the things it mentions is RFID.
[02:44:42.973 --> 02:44:47.577]  That you'll basically have a device that's wireless that won't need to charge.
[02:44:47.637 --> 02:44:49.138]  It's self-charged all the time.
[02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:52.321]  Over a frequency.
[02:44:52.361 --> 02:44:53.863]  It has like a little antenna in it.
[02:44:54.303 --> 02:45:00.328]  You plug this thing with an antenna and you have anything else with an antenna, it takes the power wirelessly out there.
[02:45:00.648 --> 02:45:02.090]  This stuff's not supposed to be around.
[02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:04.972]  And it's out there now.
[02:45:05.012 --> 02:45:06.674]  I'm not hearing about it on the news or anything.
[02:45:06.694 --> 02:45:07.334]  This is huge.
[02:45:07.394 --> 02:45:10.517]  I mean, that's like breakthrough, crazy breakthrough technology.
[02:45:13.404 --> 02:45:14.144]  Alright, I'll look into it.
[02:45:14.164 --> 02:45:17.186]  There's also a lot of crap on the internet with fake generators and stuff.
[02:45:17.706 --> 02:45:18.726]  But thank you so much.
[02:45:18.746 --> 02:45:19.707]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:19.727 --> 02:45:20.747]  Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
[02:45:21.808 --> 02:45:25.109]  Nah, I haven't found a thing about Powercast.com.
[02:45:25.189 --> 02:45:26.730]  It's not that.
[02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:28.031]  It's about casting metal.
[02:45:28.531 --> 02:45:28.931]  Whatever.
[02:45:29.572 --> 02:45:29.972]  Thank you.
[02:45:30.692 --> 02:45:32.393]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[02:45:35.634 --> 02:45:36.855]  Nick and PA, you're on the air.
[02:45:36.875 --> 02:45:37.235]  Go ahead.
[02:45:37.935 --> 02:45:39.116]  Yeah, hey Alex, Jason.
[02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:41.257]  I was hoping to speak with Michael Badnarik.
[02:45:41.687 --> 02:45:47.889]  This is Nick Kerangi in Philly, the man who got visited by Secret Service last year after confronting Bill Clinton.
[02:45:48.489 --> 02:45:49.469]  Sent a few goons out.
[02:45:49.689 --> 02:45:52.190]  Oh yeah, how dare you ask people questions, John.
[02:45:52.850 --> 02:46:09.054]  Well, you know, given the MIAC report, these Fusion Center documents coming out, I think it would be extremely prudent if we could take a moment and just discuss how to handle police encounters, how to handle yourself if you ever are to be interrogated by, say, the Secret Service.
[02:46:11.203 --> 02:46:16.606]  People have to understand that the Constitution is not from the point from which we derive our rights.
[02:46:16.706 --> 02:46:21.289]  It's simply the, you know, enunciation of what the government has to abide to.
[02:46:21.309 --> 02:46:22.229]  It's their contract.
[02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:30.654]  Your rights are enforced by you taking the initiative and upholding your natural rights.
[02:46:30.834 --> 02:46:38.799]  And that's the fact of the matter is that when we get into these confrontations like Luke Radowsky and We Are Change Ohio folks did last week over at the Al Gore event,
[02:46:39.486 --> 02:46:52.074]  Uh, they're going to attempt to intimidate you, get you to incriminate yourself, and if you don't know your rights, then you're going to end up, uh, getting into adhesion contracts and signing away your rights for privileges.
[02:46:55.696 --> 02:46:56.096]  Yeah.
[02:46:56.997 --> 02:46:57.197]  Yeah.
[02:46:57.918 --> 02:46:58.138]  Yeah.
[02:46:58.178 --> 02:47:06.663]  So, um, I was, yeah, I was hoping that Mike Battenarik might give people a basic tutorial on that, but, um, and in my own experience recently, we've been getting into a lot of
[02:47:07.327 --> 02:47:23.673]  A lot of constitutional issues in the courtroom, dealing with traffic disputes, just general civil liberties issues, and we're finding more and more that a lot of these adhesion contracts, the social security cards, driver's licenses, etc., are in many ways
[02:47:25.492 --> 02:47:28.633]  Sacrificing our God-given rights for the privileges of the state.
[02:47:28.953 --> 02:47:31.693]  Yeah, they have you waive them, and that was to get you trained to do it.
[02:47:32.053 --> 02:47:40.255]  Now they're just color of law, and by general acceptance, they've tried to make it like a common law, and they come after you if you don't have all of it, and they're so brainwashed they don't know.
[02:47:40.595 --> 02:47:45.656]  Now they're now saying Second Amendment's a privilege, and if we accept that claim, they'll then start enforcing it.
[02:47:45.896 --> 02:47:48.216]  It's like they claim traveling's a privilege when it's not.
[02:47:48.536 --> 02:47:49.217]  Thank you so much.
[02:47:49.257 --> 02:47:50.357]  Good to hear from you, Nick Garangi.
[02:47:50.397 --> 02:47:50.777]  Great guy.
[02:47:51.717 --> 02:47:54.519]  Let's talk to Louise in Missouri.
[02:47:54.539 --> 02:47:55.120]  You're on the air.
[02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:55.540]  Go ahead.
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:56.401]  Hello.
[02:47:56.421 --> 02:47:57.421]  Hi.
[02:47:57.782 --> 02:48:00.463]  I'm actually here with Representative Jim Guest in Missouri.
[02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:03.065]  This is our office.
[02:48:03.085 --> 02:48:11.491]  I wasn't sure he was going to be able to get down here because he is currently on the House floor and they have been back and forth voting.
[02:48:11.511 --> 02:48:15.814]  I didn't know that Jim Guest wanted to come on the show or I would have had him on.
[02:48:16.354 --> 02:48:19.076]  It's hard to get back and forth and I'll hand the phone to him.
[02:48:20.549 --> 02:48:21.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:48:39.821 --> 02:48:40.341]  Hello, Alex.
[02:48:40.641 --> 02:48:43.782]  Hey, Representative Guest, I didn't know you'd been holding while I was ranting and raving.
[02:48:43.822 --> 02:48:45.802]  Something big must be going on.
[02:48:45.822 --> 02:48:46.443]  Have you called in?
[02:48:46.483 --> 02:48:47.203]  I apologize.
[02:48:47.223 --> 02:48:48.243]  What's going on?
[02:48:48.643 --> 02:48:50.024]  We are voting on.
[02:48:50.064 --> 02:48:51.124]  Bill's up on the floor.
[02:48:51.224 --> 02:48:52.004]  There's lots of debate.
[02:48:52.064 --> 02:48:52.984]  I ran down here.
[02:48:53.024 --> 02:48:55.445]  I heard that you were on about this.
[02:48:55.485 --> 02:48:59.146]  And, you know, the more I delve into this, the more questions people are asking.
[02:48:59.426 --> 02:49:07.628]  And I'm planning on having a hearing here in the state capitol before my committee on Real ID and personal privacy, calling the
[02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:17.541]  Public Safety, the Department of My Act, and the Department of Highway Patrol request that they come to a hearing so we can ask them further questions.
[02:49:17.621 --> 02:49:23.883]  I just come trying to get somebody to admit that this is tied into the federal level, and that's where the directive is coming down to.
[02:49:23.923 --> 02:49:35.565]  There's just more unanswered questions, and every day we find out, like here in Missouri, that when you go to get your driver's license, they do a background check on you through a national database.
[02:49:36.185 --> 02:49:37.365]  Right now it may be
[02:49:38.157 --> 02:49:43.784]  Somewhat innocent as far as checking for lack of child support payments, a few things like that.
[02:49:43.804 --> 02:49:49.211]  But once they start that, they link it to other databases, you know, they're going to do a complete background check on you.
[02:49:49.272 --> 02:49:51.334]  So that's some of our concerns.
[02:49:51.394 --> 02:49:54.819]  And let's say we're continuing to here and end with this fiasco at the St.
[02:49:54.859 --> 02:49:56.481]  Louis airport a couple of weeks ago with the
[02:49:57.837 --> 02:50:05.199]  Yeah, they see you have a couple thousand in cash and they say, we're calling the FBI, you're not allowed to have cash, slave.
[02:50:05.219 --> 02:50:18.082]  In fact, I want to schedule you back on the show, sir, for those that don't know, your representative there, who's introduced the bill to reaffirm states' rights, also some second amendment
[02:50:18.522 --> 02:50:18.682]  I think?
[02:50:38.651 --> 02:50:46.977]  I heard there's been some resignations and things, and then Lieutenant Governor, I know I've seen the press conference, came out and talked about how this is demonizing conservatives, libertarians, and others.
[02:50:47.858 --> 02:50:52.061]  So can you just briefly, Representative Guest, tell us where the bill is to get state sovereignty?
[02:50:52.481 --> 02:50:54.142]  Oh, that's great.
[02:50:54.162 --> 02:51:00.267]  I presented it in the Senate side yesterday, and I got a very positive response from it.
[02:51:00.347 --> 02:51:05.931]  The committee chairman, who is the Missouri floor leader, fully supports that, so I hope it comes to a
[02:51:07.407 --> 02:51:10.769]  Absolutely, but there were some resignations and things over the Mayak report.
[02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:46.172]  Right, the director of the MIAC has been reassigned, let's put it that way, to another division there and they've got a new director and they've kind of admitted and that's why I want to have my hearing.
[02:51:47.113 --> 02:51:56.720]  I think the employee was just writing that up and releasing it without basically any oversight at all, so that's certainly a responsibility in our department.
[02:51:57.796 --> 02:52:06.762]  Yeah, well the media's been trying to link Ron Paul, Libertarians, Conservatives to Terrorists lately, and to White Supremacists and others, and it's totally made up.
[02:52:06.822 --> 02:52:15.188]  They need to just deal with some of the groups that have shown they're violent and dangerous, and not mix people with Ron Paul bumper stickers into that, because there's no evidence of that, and it's wrong.
[02:52:15.768 --> 02:52:19.771]  And fire out your website, Representative, for folks that want to find out more about the fine work you're doing.
[02:52:20.271 --> 02:52:22.613]  Okay, I've got two of them.
[02:52:22.733 --> 02:52:25.835]  The Laurie Legislators Against RealID.com.
[02:52:26.813 --> 02:52:41.906]  And then my state website is JimGuest.com and then I've got those there and then I've got some links to some other sites to my TheJimGuestShow.com, which I have a weekly radio program on that.
[02:52:42.886 --> 02:52:44.968]  Anyway, we've been working on this.
[02:52:45.008 --> 02:52:48.791]  We kind of discovered a few years ago that possibly this DIAC thing was connected to them.
[02:52:48.851 --> 02:52:51.614]  Now, some of the pieces are starting to fall in place now.
[02:52:52.619 --> 02:52:54.760]  Well, God bless you, sir, and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:55.661]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:52:56.701 --> 02:52:59.603]  Next time you contact us, let us know it's you.
[02:52:59.803 --> 02:53:00.743]  Thank you so much.
[02:53:01.404 --> 02:53:01.964]  Thank you, sir.
[02:53:02.704 --> 02:53:12.810]  You know, I've got to leave it there because I've got to go write questions for Aaron who's on a plane tomorrow to speak of Kansas City, going to Kansas City to interview a financial expert for the film.
[02:53:14.147 --> 02:53:16.831]  The second Obama film, it's really about Obama.
[02:53:16.851 --> 02:53:20.295]  The Obama Deception is about Obama, but how he's a puppet, a globalist, a front man.
[02:53:20.656 --> 02:53:23.700]  This is how they're going to financially destroy everything and bring in their new world order.
[02:53:24.361 --> 02:53:30.750]  And how the fraud's working with just top names and, you know, top economists, you name it, federal investigators.
[02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:31.891]  Uh, and others.
[02:53:32.371 --> 02:53:34.172]  So, that film is coming up.
[02:53:34.192 --> 02:53:39.376]  I've got to go do that now, and then go home and see the family, because I'm on Raleigh Janes for two hours tonight, then I'm going to be on your show at 11 tonight.
[02:53:39.756 --> 02:53:40.757]  No rest for us here.
[02:53:41.218 --> 02:53:42.378]  But it is insane.
[02:53:42.498 --> 02:53:46.662]  I've got to tell Rob Duke, because I tell him all these guests I want on, and then he gets them on.
[02:53:47.482 --> 02:53:49.524]  I've got to tell him, just leave two or three days a week open.
[02:53:49.864 --> 02:53:58.991]  Because in the old days, I would just take call after call, and it was police, military, government, state reps calling in, and I never take calls anymore, or if I do, I make them hold for an hour.
[02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:00.881]  Or two or three.
[02:54:15.612 --> 02:54:16.552]  Call in on Jason's show.
[02:54:16.592 --> 02:54:17.633]  He's good about taking calls.
[02:54:18.673 --> 02:54:19.533]  9 to midnight tonight.
[02:54:19.573 --> 02:54:22.934]  I'm only popping in a little bit on the back thing for about 20 minutes at 11.
[02:54:23.014 --> 02:54:23.914]  So we are out of time.
[02:54:23.954 --> 02:54:26.755]  Jason Burmasill will have this whole 100-something page thing.
[02:54:26.775 --> 02:54:28.816]  You've got to go home and walk your dogs, I know, and come back.
[02:54:28.836 --> 02:54:30.796]  But you're going to have this read and covered.
[02:54:31.436 --> 02:54:32.237]  9 to midnight tonight.
[02:54:32.257 --> 02:54:33.437]  The GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:33.837 --> 02:54:36.639]  Affiliates that pick up my show need to pick up Burmese's show.
[02:54:37.059 --> 02:54:40.121]  Need to grow that sucker, it is growing, so be sure and join him 9 to midnight tonight.
[02:54:40.501 --> 02:54:43.563]  And I'll be up on, against him on XM and AM and FM's across the country.
[02:54:43.863 --> 02:54:46.784]  With Raleigh James for two hours tonight as well, no rest for us.
[02:54:47.125 --> 02:54:49.926]  Great job to the crew, that was a five hour, two minute show.
[02:54:50.507 --> 02:54:54.629]  We are out of here for a few minutes of rest, then right back into the work day.
[02:54:54.669 --> 02:54:55.149]  Stay with us.
[02:54:58.864 --> 02:55:01.105]  I said, re-transmission starts now!
[02:55:01.365 --> 02:55:02.466]  With Camfo, man!
[02:55:02.546 --> 02:55:06.308]  I'm not about to shut up, this is gonna go on forever!
[02:55:06.328 --> 02:55:07.348]  Re-transmission starts now.
[02:55:07.528 --> 02:55:07.829]  Hold on!
[02:55:23.373 --> 02:55:23.673]  Hold on.
[02:55:24.194 --> 02:55:25.675]  You didn't go to rebroadcast, did you?
[02:55:25.695 --> 02:55:26.175]  Go on, folks.
[02:55:26.195 --> 02:55:27.056]  Whatever goes on here.
[02:55:27.356 --> 02:55:27.957]  It's all right, Burmese.
[02:55:27.997 --> 02:55:28.497]  Let's continue.
[02:55:28.518 --> 02:55:33.362]  Yeah, you know, again, Alex, right before guests got on, I read this part, which is just in the second page.
[02:55:34.202 --> 02:55:40.428]  This is a law enforcement sensitive information and is protected by the Code of Virginia Title 52-48 and 52-49.
[02:55:40.448 --> 02:55:48.475]  Further distribution of this document is restricted to law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies, and, of course, Department of Defense organizations
[02:55:48.935 --> 02:55:49.256]  Only.
[02:55:49.276 --> 02:55:53.539]  Because you can't let the enemy, the American people, know what's going on, but they can let other governments know.
[02:55:53.639 --> 02:56:00.324]  And then right here, in big, bold letters, it says, no report or segment thereof may be released to any media sources.
[02:56:00.344 --> 02:56:01.185]  Well, too bad we have it.
[02:56:01.766 --> 02:56:04.708]  It's too bad it's going to be all over the web, and you're going to have to retract this one, too.
[02:56:04.728 --> 02:56:05.869]  You're going to have to apologize.
[02:56:06.029 --> 02:56:08.551]  And we know that it's not just in Virginia, it's everywhere else.
[02:56:09.031 --> 02:56:12.754]  Big time, tonight, 9 to 10, just on this 215 page document.
[02:56:12.814 --> 02:56:15.477]  Let me give people a shot of it, or they'll say it doesn't exist.
[02:56:15.497 --> 02:56:16.417]  Yeah, I know, it can't exist.
[02:56:19.633 --> 02:56:20.334]  Zoom in over here.
[02:56:20.514 --> 02:56:21.894]  Or Burmy, just hold it up and they can see it.
[02:56:21.934 --> 02:56:23.415]  Yeah, it's right, yeah.
[02:56:23.855 --> 02:56:24.555]  The feds wrote it.
[02:56:24.595 --> 02:56:29.157]  It's the same exact wording of the, except for the state of the last document.
[02:56:29.337 --> 02:56:30.918]  It won't, it'll be blurred if you do that.
[02:56:30.938 --> 02:56:31.798]  That's how cameras work.
[02:56:32.619 --> 02:56:34.319]  It won't have the virus setting if you do that.
[02:56:34.379 --> 02:56:36.200]  Just back up and they can get it.
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:37.981]  Everything's insane.
[02:56:38.021 --> 02:56:39.602]  Now guys, you can zoom in on the Burmy.
[02:56:40.082 --> 02:56:42.723]  Okay, now I gotta go write these questions and then get out of here.
[02:56:42.743 --> 02:56:46.825]  I gotta go see my kids for a couple hours before I'm chained back up to the radio.
[02:56:48.085 --> 02:56:48.846]  But there it is.
[02:56:48.866 --> 02:56:50.527]  Hey, this is up on Infowars.com.
[02:56:50.567 --> 02:56:52.008]  I want Nemo to do a big report on it.
[02:56:52.408 --> 02:56:53.589]  No rest for you either, Nemo.
[02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:57.712]  And Watson supposedly has this big chemtrail report coming out in the near future.
[02:56:57.732 --> 02:56:59.073]  Okay, now that is the end.
[02:57:01.135 --> 02:57:01.855]  Oh yeah!
[02:57:04.337 --> 02:57:04.857]  We are out of here.
[02:57:04.877 --> 02:57:05.518]  God bless you all.
