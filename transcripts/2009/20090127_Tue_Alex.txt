[00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:08.339]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.042]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:11.844]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:13.326]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:14.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:19.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.931]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:26.073]  We are live here.
[00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.293]  We've got two hours left.
[00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:29.835]  We just began simulcasting in the shower.
[00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:33.117]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:38.781]  For the next 60 minutes, Gerald Salenta, who's kind enough to join us once a month,
[00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.694]  He is recognized by CNN, Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and many others as the premier trends forecaster.
[00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:55.960]  He runs the Trends Forecasting Center and he has made thousands of predictions that have come accurately true or come very close to being true.
[00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:03.785]  He has predicted that there is a very good chance that in the next few months we're going to see runs on many banks, more bank closures.
[00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:04.626]  That's already begun.
[00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.727]  He said that last month there.
[00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:10.003]  So I wanted to get him on to talk about new developments.
[00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:18.807]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, Bob Chapman, other financial experts we have on, have been telling me two to three years till total collapse.
[00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:22.309]  They've now in the last week on the show, last two weeks on the show, revised it.
[00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.273]  They're saying that we could start going into full bore depression and being admitted even in the next six months to a year, but deepening for the next two years.
[00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.714]  Gerald Cilente, good to have you back on with us.
[00:01:33.214 --> 00:01:35.195]  Oh, thank you so much for having me on, Alex.
[00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:43.254]  This is a short segment, but getting into the economy right now, are you revising anything from what you said a month ago, or is it still going ahead full steam?
[00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:47.115]  Well, we're in the collapse of 08, current events of 09.
[00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:49.076]  Current events form future trends.
[00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:50.516]  Look at the data yesterday.
[00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:53.578]  75,000 jobs wiped out.
[00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.158]  This is just the beginning.
[00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:58.379]  The commercial real estate collapse is on the way.
[00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:05.082]  There's not going to be anyone to rent these vacant retail spaces and commercial
[00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:06.323]  We're good to go.
[00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:35.714]  What about mid-February?
[00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.495]  You said a lot of big bank failures, maybe even a bank holiday.
[00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:40.515]  Are we still on track for that?
[00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:42.116]  Yep, we're still on.
[00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:56.559]  As a matter of fact, we sent out a trend alert regarding the Obama administration, and we're expecting something very draconian, very major to happen that is going to happen in the banking sector.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.261]  They may call it a bank holiday, confiscation of gold.
[00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.581]  We don't know what it will be.
[00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:13.635]  But we do believe it will be very big, and the bottom line will be that it's going to hurt us little people, as they like to call us, taxpayers.
[00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:26.585]  And it's also imperative to note that what they're calling nationalization is really of the banking system, what they keep putting out that trial balloon.
[00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:28.627]  It's not nationalization at all.
[00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:29.848]  What it is,
[00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.378]  It's Wall Street just playing a different game.
[00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.861]  And now, of course, Wall Street's in control of Washington.
[00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.242]  You know, it's the D.C.
[00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:38.743]  heist.
[00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:50.331]  We had Henry Paulson, who just left, was the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, and now they've brought in Timothy Geithner, as we all know from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to be Treasury Secretary.
[00:03:50.872 --> 00:03:55.636]  So what they're really doing is they're calling it nationalization, but it's very simple.
[00:03:56.076 --> 00:03:57.397]  They're taking the bad debt
[00:03:57.822 --> 00:03:58.102]  Thank you.
[00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:17.669]  As opposed to big bankers, banksters that are too big to fail.
[00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.231]  Well, not just putting the bad debt on us.
[00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:29.018]  If you really look at this, and I agree with you, they're using the trillions, and they won't say where they've gone, to buy up industry.
[00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:36.464]  And then you hear, oh, the government's putting rules on Ford or Chevy if they bail them out, and the banks are internationally taking them over.
[00:04:36.864 --> 00:04:40.727]  So it's the banks in the Wall Street heist openly becoming government.
[00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:42.004]  That's right.
[00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:47.808]  So, the government's not taking them over, they're taking over the government, just like the IMF, World Bank, New and Third World Countries.
[00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:48.569]  Exactly.
[00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.473]  Let's flesh that out with Gerald Cilente, straight ahead, right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:07.920]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.445]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:17.086]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:05:17.306 --> 00:05:21.209]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.052]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:29.394]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:33.177]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared to use.
[00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:33.617]  I think so.
[00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:16.321]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:06:16.662 --> 00:06:27.326]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:30.908]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.850]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.634]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:07:56.127 --> 00:07:57.428]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:07:57.488 --> 00:08:10.635]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:14.197]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:21.544]  TrendsResearch.com is his very informative website.
[00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:30.630]  Be sure to check out a subscription to his Trends Forecaster bulletins, his intelligence reports, at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:36.694]  Okay, I have a lot of questions for you, Gerald Cilenti, and I want to open the phones up for Randy, Dave, Paul, Anthony, and others that are holding.
[00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:38.836]  They can ask myself or yourself a question.
[00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:45.160]  I want to finish up with the hijacking by Wall Street and the Bank of England, the City of London, of things.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.321]  They engineered the crisis.
[00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.243]  They set up NORTHCOM to be used against the American people.
[00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:52.605]  They used terrorism as the pretext.
[00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.827]  Now they flip it and admit it's for the American people.
[00:08:56.008 --> 00:08:59.591]  Obama is continuing all the exact same policies with a little bit different rhetoric.
[00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.473]  Increasing troops in the Middle East, Central Asia.
[00:09:03.414 --> 00:09:06.016]  Continuing the warrantless wiretapping of the American people.
[00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:09.839]  Administration openly run by Timothy Geithner.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.801]  Same crew.
[00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.232]  How long until the public figure out they've been bamboozled?
[00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:26.198]  Or will they, buying into the mass delusion, thinking that it was Bush that did all this when he was just a puppet like Obama, say, hey, if you don't go along with Obama, you're the cause of it.
[00:09:26.218 --> 00:09:28.499]  We're already getting emails saying that.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.740]  We predicted that.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:36.864]  That if we don't get into work brigades, and we don't sacrifice, and we don't go into this planned austerity and the carbon tax, that we're bad.
[00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:40.547]  So, finishing up with the Wall Street hijacking,
[00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:48.770]  Your analysis of Obama and how you see this playing out historically with all the different factors you've got.
[00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:53.573]  Well, first of all, just to make it clear, we're political atheists.
[00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:56.555]  We don't believe in anybody's political religion.
[00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.136]  We don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:04.380]  And I've been around long enough without going into my background, it's on the website, to know better.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.844]  So, you know, I just don't... So when we talk about Obama, it's not like we like somebody else.
[00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:17.729]  This is the presidential reality show, episode 2, Obama moves into the White House.
[00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.273]  This is America Loves Entertainment and they now have a celebrity president.
[00:10:24.313 --> 00:10:27.495]  He's the Tiger Woods of the political scene.
[00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:30.737]  People are going to buy into this for a long time.
[00:10:30.777 --> 00:10:38.782]  We sent out a trend alert recently just about this very topic and that the people are so fearful and desperate
[00:10:39.349 --> 00:10:43.450]  They'll believe the thinnest veneer has substance to it.
[00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.450]  And so they have this hope.
[00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:50.632]  And hope, by the way, is the most negative word in the metaphysical dictionary.
[00:10:50.652 --> 00:10:51.772]  It means nothing.
[00:10:51.872 --> 00:10:57.673]  You know, it means wishing that you scratch off that lotto number and win without doing anything.
[00:10:58.213 --> 00:11:03.175]  So people are going to buy into the Obama rhetoric for a long time.
[00:11:03.215 --> 00:11:08.896]  And as you well know, and I think you articulated it, his early measures that he's taken
[00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:21.734]  Which is support his core base, the closing of Guantanamo, the emissions standards, the canar about the executive pay and his staff, the lobbyist things.
[00:11:21.754 --> 00:11:23.655]  You know, these are all the abortion issues.
[00:11:23.675 --> 00:11:30.460]  These are all little things that his core support really, you know, let's say, look he's doing something for us.
[00:11:30.993 --> 00:11:41.357]  And just as he did, he promised that core supporters that he was going to end the war in Iraq the day he got in, bring troops home the day he got into office, and change that to 16 months.
[00:11:41.777 --> 00:11:56.723]  So what he's doing is he's solidifying his core support, and as you so well articulated, he's just carrying on the policies and the big issues in the economy and geopolitical as the previous administrations.
[00:11:57.336 --> 00:12:00.137]  So, but the people are going to believe this for a long time.
[00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:01.397]  That's the bottom line.
[00:12:02.218 --> 00:12:09.860]  And they're going to have that core support that's going to stick with them because they'll conveniently blame the Bush administration.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.301]  Of course, they have plenty of blame to go around.
[00:12:12.381 --> 00:12:16.342]  Bush, Clinton, all of the criminal class that goes back.
[00:12:17.422 --> 00:12:26.025]  But most of the people are so hopeless, so feared, they're so much gripped in fear and desperate that they'll buy the thinnest lines.
[00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:52.487]  Well, I agree with you, and I see four years, six years, eight years down the road, though, they will then, all the things the internationalists have done, they will then blame it all on the very puppet they built up, and then they'll give us a new savior, and all the hatred of the old puppet will be converted to love for the new puppet, and then the phony left-right dog-and-pony show, and of course you worked at the high levels in politics, it will just continue to roll forward.
[00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:56.930]  Yeah, well, here's what we're forecasting, Alex.
[00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.176]  Unless the people break their paradigm.
[00:12:59.216 --> 00:12:59.916]  Yep, go ahead.
[00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:04.900]  We think that around March, February, March, as we said, you know, we're going to start seeing big failures.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.922]  The fear is going to start running very real.
[00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:14.347]  You know, as a Bronx boy, my saying is, when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:25.835]  And you well know better than I do about these detention centers and the training of troops and the state police in anticipation of economic riots.
[00:13:26.437 --> 00:13:27.998]  We're going to see that.
[00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:39.566]  We believe that the myth will stay in place for several months, maybe even a year, two years tops.
[00:13:40.226 --> 00:13:51.274]  But then it'll start breaking apart for real, because he's going to continue his policies, should he, in regard to the Middle East and economics, Obama.
[00:13:51.753 --> 00:13:58.715]  And he will then, by then, with the disillusionment running so deep, that will be the end of the honeymoon.
[00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:06.558]  From that point forward, we're pretty confident that we're going to see a real third-party movement in this country by 2012.
[00:14:07.258 --> 00:14:10.779]  And we think that this could be a real pivot point.
[00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:12.560]  It could go either way.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.862]  And we're taking the position now, in our forecast,
[00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:24.692]  That this could be a positive change to the type of country that many of us believe in.
[00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:34.938]  And that is with more, and of course not to use it as a bait signal, saying it in the wrong context, but more states' rights.
[00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:38.741]  We don't need a bunch of federal fools to tell us how to think and act.
[00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:43.244]  And these secessionist movements are going to take hold, we believe, more and more.
[00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:56.878]  And that we're going to start moving into something that resembles what the United States used to look like, as this other force, as you so well articulate, is trying to push us in another way.
[00:14:57.278 --> 00:15:02.880]  So, as Ron Paul agrees with you, this is a key time, because as Lennon said,
[00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:08.440]  There are times in history, to paraphrase, when more happens in a month than happened in ten years.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:16.286]  We're in that time when society is unfrozen from the status quo and it can be changed for the good or it can be changed for the worst.
[00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:27.515]  The establishment has seen this coming, is prepared, wants to try to bring in a total tyranny, but it's going to be so unpopular, no matter how fancy they build up a front man, no matter
[00:15:28.496 --> 00:15:30.377]  How much, you know, celebrity they put into it.
[00:15:31.137 --> 00:15:40.321]  At the end of the day, when somebody's hungry or losing their house, or doesn't have a job, or just got mugged, the bull is not going to work anymore.
[00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:41.481]  That's right.
[00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.762]  You know, this is again the presidential reality show.
[00:15:45.303 --> 00:15:49.404]  And shows start losing their ratings after a while when they turn bad.
[00:15:49.904 --> 00:15:51.565]  And again, that's all this is.
[00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.066]  This is, you know, celebrity.
[00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:56.467]  And it's going to lose its veneer.
[00:15:56.932 --> 00:16:04.615]  And you know, by the way, one of the ways that I built my reputation was one of my early books, Trend Tracking, that I actually wrote in 1988.
[00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:08.597]  I had predicted the rise of a third party.
[00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:12.238]  This was a time when only 13% of the Americans believed so.
[00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:17.780]  And I also mentioned Ross Perot as the probable candidate for some reason.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.682]  I don't know why I brought his name up at that time.
[00:16:21.142 --> 00:16:24.203]  And I think I'm totally in agreement with Ron Paul.
[00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:30.429]  That there's going to be that transition period when people say, we've had enough of both of these people.
[00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:35.651]  But will the candidate emerge?
[00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:44.653]  As much as I admire Ron Paul, he lacks that celebrity kind of thing that's so important in a society as thin as America.
[00:16:44.893 --> 00:16:46.113]  He doesn't have the charisma.
[00:16:46.133 --> 00:16:46.273]  Exactly.
[00:16:46.414 --> 00:16:47.274]  But someone else can.
[00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:55.002]  That's amazing.
[00:16:55.282 --> 00:17:02.949]  Going back, though, to pick your brain a bit more, Barack Obama is already betraying most of his stances.
[00:17:02.969 --> 00:17:04.950]  He's thrown a few bones, but they're hollow.
[00:17:06.412 --> 00:17:09.955]  We'll look in a year at closing Guantanamo, but we're going to keep indefinite detention.
[00:17:11.857 --> 00:17:13.838]  That's because that policy is defeated.
[00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:19.904]  That move for us to accept all this was defeated, so now he has to at least partially repudiate it.
[00:17:19.924 --> 00:17:21.825]  But when you look at what he's doing, it is hollow.
[00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:35.697]  Meanwhile, the main international takeover by the banks openly announcing they're going to have an offshore world bank that sets world regulations and controls the nations when it's the very bankers that engineered all of this now posing as the saviors.
[00:17:36.377 --> 00:17:39.300]  I mean, I know they've got the power and they're going ahead by executive fiat.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.982]  When we talk about a federal government, it's not even a federal government now.
[00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.423]  It's internationally controlled.
[00:17:43.843 --> 00:17:45.985]  It's been hijacked by foreign private interest.
[00:17:46.345 --> 00:17:48.267]  How do we telegraph that message to the public?
[00:17:49.221 --> 00:17:54.782]  It's a very difficult message to telegraph, and the public won't understand it, the general public.
[00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:59.363]  It needs to happen on more basic levels, you know, the bread and butter issues.
[00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:12.886]  And I think there's going to become a point when they keep trying to squeeze more and more out of the little people, where it becomes a time when the revolt begins.
[00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:17.787]  It's not going to happen through an education of something like that.
[00:18:18.174 --> 00:18:22.737]  Because it's too arcane for most people to either understand or accept.
[00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:29.041]  Because most people are only fed sound bites of information upon which they make decisions on.
[00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:32.443]  So that's very important in the communication aspect.
[00:18:32.763 --> 00:18:34.764]  It's too big an issue for them to swallow.
[00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:43.890]  States, like another corporation, has had a violent corporate takeover by an outside group.
[00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.452]  I mean, people don't know that big corporations spy on each other and have
[00:18:48.598 --> 00:18:51.659]  Private mercenaries and own their people in governments.
[00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:54.560]  They don't understand that that's what the New World Order is.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:01.601]  It's private group of corporations, robber barons, setting up their own world government and hijacking nations through payoffs.
[00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:04.602]  I wish the public could figure that out.
[00:19:04.642 --> 00:19:06.362]  What's so complex, Mr. Salente?
[00:19:06.382 --> 00:19:08.303]  It's beyond them.
[00:19:08.663 --> 00:19:10.984]  They don't want to believe it, number one.
[00:19:13.224 --> 00:19:16.105]  They think of these things as conspiracy theories.
[00:19:16.744 --> 00:19:24.866]  You know, they've been indoctrinated all their lives through the college industrial complex to all think alike.
[00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:30.027]  So they would never, you know, this is way beyond their grasp of understanding.
[00:19:30.567 --> 00:19:41.609]  I mean, how many people really know that the major issue in the United States politics throughout the entire 1800s was about the central bankers taking over the country?
[00:19:43.598 --> 00:19:45.419]  Gerald Cilente, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:45.459 --> 00:19:47.700]  The website is Trends Research.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.261]  One word, TrendsResearch.com.
[00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:53.363]  We'll put it up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv during the break.
[00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:59.005]  We're going to come back, sir, and get more into solutions and then your phone calls.
[00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:00.466]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:00.686 --> 00:20:02.427]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:08.954]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:20:09.134 --> 00:20:14.296]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:20:14.576 --> 00:20:19.658]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:20:19.938 --> 00:20:23.520]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.520]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.581]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[00:20:28.781 --> 00:20:31.842]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:35.603]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:20:35.863 --> 00:20:40.404]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:20:40.684 --> 00:20:41.464]  Do your part.
[00:20:41.724 --> 00:20:43.985]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[00:20:44.345 --> 00:20:50.466]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:20:50.786 --> 00:20:53.189]  Up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:02.097]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:21:02.818 --> 00:21:09.205]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:11.267]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:12.202 --> 00:21:13.243]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:13.763 --> 00:21:14.264]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:15.505]  This is his M.O.
[00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:16.906]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:16.926 --> 00:21:18.568]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:18.908 --> 00:21:25.674]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:26.054 --> 00:21:26.495]  Some U.S.
[00:21:26.555 --> 00:21:32.180]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.423]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:36.764 --> 00:21:46.632]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:47.613]  Fabled enemies.

[00:21:55.861 --> 00:21:59.204]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:06.352]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:22:06.672 --> 00:22:10.173]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:04.014]  I think so.
[00:23:21.732 --> 00:23:22.012]  I think so.
[00:23:51.232 --> 00:23:54.193]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:23:54.453 --> 00:23:56.794]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:23:56.974 --> 00:24:01.976]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:24:04.617 --> 00:24:09.779]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:10.439 --> 00:24:12.800]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:14.441 --> 00:24:19.003]  Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster in the world, is our guest.
[00:24:21.454 --> 00:24:28.440]  Gerald, what else do you see on the horizon since we talked to you a month ago?
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.902]  I know a lot has unfolded.
[00:24:30.922 --> 00:24:37.107]  What do you see on the military front with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq?
[00:24:37.127 --> 00:24:40.530]  We know Obama's announcing 30,000 more troops to go to Afghanistan.
[00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:45.454]  Those troops basically be replaced in Iraq with army forces.
[00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:48.677]  They're saying get ready for a lot higher casualties.
[00:24:48.757 --> 00:24:52.020]  Is this part of what Biden said was going to be so unpopular?
[00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:55.964]  Or is that going to be some type of bank devaluation coming up?
[00:24:56.745 --> 00:25:02.510]  Well, on the geopolitical front, what we're most concerned about is Israel and Iran.
[00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:07.695]  As we know now, as reported and confirmed by the New York Times,
[00:25:08.428 --> 00:25:16.011]  Israel had asked the Bush administration for bunker-busting bombs to attack the Iranian nuclear facilities.
[00:25:16.871 --> 00:25:26.595]  If such an act ever occurs, if either the United States or Israel attacks Iran, it will be the beginning of World War III.
[00:25:26.615 --> 00:25:37.940]  This is not Iraq, and any person of history knows that Iran fought Iraq between 1980 and 1988 in a war funded by the United States on Iraq's Iraqi side.
[00:25:38.986 --> 00:25:45.030]  And they didn't give up one inch of territory to Iraq, and they lost over a million people in the process.
[00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.751]  These are the Persians.
[00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:48.472]  They're not going anywhere.
[00:25:48.993 --> 00:25:53.656]  And anybody who thinks they're going to wipe out 70 million people, they're out of their minds.
[00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:57.238]  This could be the beginning of World... It will be the beginning of World War III.
[00:25:57.638 --> 00:25:59.559]  That's our major concern.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:08.165]  And what happened during the Israeli war on Gaza, we saw that Obama didn't say one peep about it.
[00:26:08.964 --> 00:26:13.605]  Although he spoke plenty about the economy and other issues during the same time.
[00:26:13.645 --> 00:26:23.388]  And now they're being very secretive in press conferences and Hillary just signed a deal with Israel saying that they will back them basically going up against Iran last week.
[00:26:24.388 --> 00:26:37.072]  That I didn't know and so that's more information and more news too that's very sobering because if this happens there's no winning and for Israel to be bragging that they took a beating against
[00:26:37.798 --> 00:26:47.023]  Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, but they showed their bones by wiping out just about defenseless people in the Gaza.
[00:26:47.424 --> 00:26:50.385]  I mean, they're not going to fight it and win against Iran.
[00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:51.626]  It's not going to happen.
[00:26:51.946 --> 00:26:54.047]  So that's our major concern right there.
[00:26:54.067 --> 00:26:57.209]  And again, this isn't about who you like, who you don't like.
[00:26:57.249 --> 00:26:58.390]  These are just facts.
[00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:05.074]  I'd like to, you know, we were talking before the break about the takeover, the corporate takeover.
[00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:09.110]  In my book, Trends 2000, from Abraham Lincoln.
[00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.052]  You may be familiar with this, but it's very apropos for the times.
[00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:21.275]  Quote, the money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity.
[00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:28.899]  It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy.
[00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:34.041]  I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me
[00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:38.673]  And causes me to tremble for the safety of my country.
[00:27:39.413 --> 00:27:41.854]  Corporations have been enthroned.
[00:27:41.874 --> 00:27:59.621]  An era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed.
[00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:06.204]  And that's exactly what we see happening today at a scale never before even dreamed.
[00:28:06.904 --> 00:28:07.664]  Exactly.
[00:28:08.044 --> 00:28:15.366]  And that's why I was saying that this concept is too big for the people to really embrace and understand.
[00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:29.229]  Just as we heard from General Eisenhower, who is arguably the greatest general of the 20th century, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, a two-term Republican president,
[00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:37.378]  Warning the nation as he's leaving office that the military-industrial complex is taking over the country.
[00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:39.700]  People didn't react to that.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:48.167]  And I would dare anyone to go to Eisenhower if he was still alive and tell that man that he was full of baloney.
[00:28:49.889 --> 00:28:50.289]  And that was 1960.
[00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:53.171]  Exactly.
[00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.034]  And things got progressively worse.
[00:28:56.525 --> 00:28:59.626]  And the military-industrial complex got even bigger.
[00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:14.052]  Again, look who Obama just nominated, just brought in as his Deputy Defense Secretary, a chief lobbyist for one of the greatest of all of the military-industrial complex companies, Raytheon.
[00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.793]  Man, Gerald Salenta, you are absolutely on target.
[00:29:18.813 --> 00:29:20.335]  We always learn so much from you.
[00:29:20.355 --> 00:29:28.184]  Before we go to break and come back and take calls, tell folks how they can go subscribe to this valuable information at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:36.794]  You can go to TrendsResearch.com and also, Alex, they should look at our forecast from 2008 as well as the new forecast.
[00:29:37.287 --> 00:29:43.111]  So they could see what we said and what has happened and they could think for themselves to decide what will happen next.
[00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:46.153]  He's on target, like nobody else we know.
[00:29:46.273 --> 00:29:47.514]  He's Gerald Cilente.
[00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:50.756]  We'll be right back with more from him and your calls straight ahead.
[00:29:53.698 --> 00:29:56.700]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.621 --> 00:30:00.323]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.459 --> 00:30:05.481]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.023]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:30:08.043 --> 00:30:10.625]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:11.846]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:30:11.866 --> 00:30:13.487]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:30:13.567 --> 00:30:16.409]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:30:16.449 --> 00:30:20.112]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:30:29.742 --> 00:30:34.551]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:30:34.611 --> 00:30:35.693]  An inside job.
[00:30:38.417 --> 00:30:39.478]  How dare you?
[00:30:39.898 --> 00:30:45.904]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:30:45.924 --> 00:30:48.726]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:30:48.826 --> 00:30:54.991]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.

[00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:02.858]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:31:03.388 --> 00:31:04.909]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:31:05.089 --> 00:31:06.530]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.072]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:31:09.512 --> 00:31:14.255]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:17.517]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:31:17.838 --> 00:31:21.340]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:31:21.744 --> 00:31:33.733]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:31:34.293 --> 00:31:36.295]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:31:36.315 --> 00:31:37.616]  I use one every day.
[00:31:38.036 --> 00:31:40.478]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:31:40.718 --> 00:31:41.279]  We're good.
[00:32:03.482 --> 00:32:06.743]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:32:06.923 --> 00:32:10.984]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:32:11.164 --> 00:32:22.607]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:32:22.827 --> 00:32:28.649]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:32:28.889 --> 00:32:29.530]  We're good to go.
[00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.530]  We don't need no education.
[00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.372]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:33:29.558 --> 00:33:32.821]  TrendsResearch.com, TrendsResearch.com.
[00:33:34.062 --> 00:33:35.282]  Go there, check it out today.
[00:33:35.382 --> 00:33:36.843]  Invaluable information.
[00:33:36.883 --> 00:33:50.553]  Because, as you've said many times, Mr. Salente, and I've had this scene in some of my own life, studying the global elite, studying trends, studying what the big white papers from the think tanks are saying, but you do your own wide spectrum analysis and integrate all that,
[00:33:51.735 --> 00:33:53.017]  You know what's going to happen in the future.
[00:33:53.037 --> 00:33:54.260]  You've got a really good idea of it.
[00:33:55.081 --> 00:33:57.686]  Just in the free market, in our own safety, in our lives.
[00:33:58.127 --> 00:33:59.129]  How important is it?
[00:34:00.054 --> 00:34:01.836]  To be engaged in the world and be informed.
[00:34:02.116 --> 00:34:04.137]  You know, some people see you and I and others as weird.
[00:34:04.158 --> 00:34:09.022]  It's kind of like, ooh, he knows how to read, or he's informed, or, you know, these are some eggheads on a mountain.
[00:34:09.062 --> 00:34:10.983]  We're just, I mean, you know, regular guys.
[00:34:11.003 --> 00:34:12.485]  At least I would think of myself as that.
[00:34:12.525 --> 00:34:16.168]  I mean, you're a genius mind, but also, you know, there's a lot of smart folks out there.
[00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:17.989]  They've just never applied themselves.
[00:34:18.009 --> 00:34:22.213]  Just like somebody else could be an expert at football or baseball or an expert at architecture.
[00:34:22.553 --> 00:34:26.596]  We have studied the architecture of how human systems work and how we operate.
[00:34:26.897 --> 00:34:28.078]  How important is it
[00:34:29.539 --> 00:34:38.064]  Well, I'm a close combat practitioner and a black belt trainer.
[00:34:38.725 --> 00:34:40.006]  And we don't wait to get hit.
[00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:44.849]  And what we're saying to people is, take evasive actions now.
[00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:47.150]  It costs nothing to be prepared.
[00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:52.034]  And when 9-11 happened, I was totally prepared for it, how he had written about it.
[00:34:52.054 --> 00:34:54.275]  USA Today, December 14th, 2000, the headline read,
[00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:00.722]  Uh, 2001 won't be our year, Trendseer says.
[00:35:01.303 --> 00:35:08.926]  And I predicted that Americans wouldn't be safe at home or abroad, and a wave of anti-Americanism was sweeping the globe, on and on.
[00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:14.308]  But anyway, when 9-11 happened, for whatever reasons, when it happened, I was prepared.
[00:35:14.784 --> 00:35:16.786]  I had my gold, I had my gun.
[00:35:17.147 --> 00:35:22.652]  If they hit Indian Point, the power plant just south of me, it would have been chaos beyond anybody's belief.
[00:35:22.993 --> 00:35:26.216]  No one could do a movie, science fiction, on what would have happened.
[00:35:26.256 --> 00:35:27.457]  It would have been so horrendous.
[00:35:27.858 --> 00:35:31.962]  So what we're telling people is that an economic 9-11 has already happened.
[00:35:32.502 --> 00:35:33.804]  Take evasive actions.
[00:35:33.904 --> 00:35:35.005]  Plan for the future.
[00:35:35.504 --> 00:35:39.946]  If you're not crazy by not listening, you're crazy to listen.
[00:35:40.286 --> 00:35:41.447]  Listen to your own gut.
[00:35:41.727 --> 00:35:46.389]  As my dear father had taught me, may his soul rest in peace, think for yourself.
[00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:47.489]  Don't be a parrot.
[00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:53.692]  And this is a time for people to really, really... He used to say, Papagallo, he'd say in Italian.
[00:35:53.732 --> 00:35:54.512]  Think for yourself.
[00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:56.953]  Stop repeating what everybody else is saying.
[00:35:57.514 --> 00:35:59.455]  And this is what people need to do now.
[00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:04.897]  Because by having your money in your hands, rather than having it in somebody else's hands,
[00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:13.699]  By having enough food in case of a catastrophe, by having a weapon to protect yourself, is not going over the edge.
[00:36:13.979 --> 00:36:17.204]  It's really stupid not to do any of those things, in my belief.
[00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:18.753]  Exactly.
[00:36:18.793 --> 00:36:24.519]  I mean, how if you're a father or a mother, or just care about yourself, how could you not want to know how the world works?
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.406]  Americans always were some of the most informed people, you know, the greatest inventions, the hardest working, the whole world.
[00:36:30.846 --> 00:36:34.711]  Foreigners from France, Alexander de Tocqueville and others came here and marveled.
[00:36:34.791 --> 00:36:38.014]  Now they come here and marvel at how lethargic
[00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:40.476]  How people don't want to be involved.
[00:36:40.516 --> 00:36:42.137]  How people don't want to be informed.
[00:36:42.177 --> 00:36:47.240]  How they think it's a feather in their cap to brag how stupid they are.
[00:36:47.861 --> 00:36:49.162]  It's a fake selfishness.
[00:36:49.282 --> 00:36:49.802]  I don't care.
[00:36:49.822 --> 00:36:50.763]  I don't care.
[00:36:52.344 --> 00:36:55.686]  As if that's a cloak of invincibility when it's the opposite.
[00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:58.747]  When you're blind, stumbling around the freeway, you're going to die.
[00:36:58.808 --> 00:37:00.769]  It's not cute or funny to be ignorant.
[00:37:01.348 --> 00:37:09.180]  Yeah, exactly, and our education system has dumbed us down and forced us to learn all the same things in the same way.
[00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:14.161]  We've become, as Lincoln so feared, a corporate society.
[00:37:14.181 --> 00:37:19.223]  I mean, could you imagine that we could only talk about Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts?
[00:37:19.683 --> 00:37:22.204]  That we could only talk about Lowe's and Home Depot?
[00:37:22.624 --> 00:37:25.265]  That we could only talk about Burger King and McDonald's?
[00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:26.846]  Look what's happened to the country.
[00:37:26.886 --> 00:37:28.107]  There's no individuality.
[00:37:28.407 --> 00:37:29.987]  But that's the important thing, Alex.
[00:37:30.327 --> 00:37:38.851]  What's going to survive in this coming Greatest Depression are the people that express their individuality, that are unique, are innovative,
[00:37:39.292 --> 00:37:41.294]  And in closing, before we go to calls,
[00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:01.132]  How hard is this ship going under?
[00:38:01.272 --> 00:38:07.417]  It's going under the worst depression that anybody, worse than the Great Depression.
[00:38:07.637 --> 00:38:09.258]  And here are the simple reasons why.
[00:38:09.558 --> 00:38:12.540]  We were an ascending nation in those days.
[00:38:13.401 --> 00:38:14.722]  I mentioned about my father.
[00:38:14.982 --> 00:38:16.103]  I have a photograph.
[00:38:16.917 --> 00:38:22.180]  In my parents' wedding in 1934, these were Italian immigrants that worked in fish stores.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.261]  My father worked in a radio factory, vegetable stores.
[00:38:25.481 --> 00:38:28.002]  You should see the way these people are dressed and the way they look.
[00:38:28.242 --> 00:38:29.763]  And all the immigrants look like that.
[00:38:29.783 --> 00:38:37.807]  If you look at a picture in the New York Times recently, they have a picture of Chrysler workers during 1933, the bank closings, trying to cast their check.
[00:38:38.047 --> 00:38:40.568]  You should see the way these people are dressed and what they look like.
[00:38:41.132 --> 00:38:43.472]  They don't look like slobs.
[00:38:43.512 --> 00:39:00.396]  I did a talk for the International Diamond Conference at the Waldorf Astoria recently, and I walked into this place, and my first time at the Waldorf was 1977, and I stayed in the suite that the shopper ran was just the night before.
[00:39:00.736 --> 00:39:04.837]  And in order to get into this place, you had to be dressed and looking fine.
[00:39:05.157 --> 00:39:08.137]  And I see people walking through this thing with flip-flops on.
[00:39:08.317 --> 00:39:10.858]  They look like a bunch of slobs this past September.
[00:39:11.368 --> 00:39:13.049]  And this is what the nation has become.
[00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:15.390]  We were an ascending society back then.
[00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.351]  We didn't have $14 trillion worth of debt, consumer debt.
[00:39:19.611 --> 00:39:20.812]  They didn't have credit cards.
[00:39:20.852 --> 00:39:25.013]  They didn't have second mortgages that they now call home equity loans.
[00:39:25.293 --> 00:39:26.694]  Most people didn't own homes.
[00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:28.966]  Back then we had a trade surplus.
[00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.827]  We were at $700 billion in the hole.
[00:39:30.867 --> 00:39:32.007]  And there was another issue.
[00:39:32.108 --> 00:39:32.928]  There was another issue.
[00:39:32.948 --> 00:39:35.109]  A lot of people, there was still corruption.
[00:39:35.529 --> 00:39:36.690]  There were still problems.
[00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.532]  But overall, we were a less corrupt society.
[00:39:40.572 --> 00:39:41.792]  A lot of handshake deals.
[00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:43.713]  But there was a reason for that.
[00:39:43.833 --> 00:39:44.914]  People weren't violent.
[00:39:44.974 --> 00:39:45.995]  People weren't criminal.
[00:39:46.455 --> 00:39:51.617]  But if you cheated somebody or screwed them, you'd end up getting your head beat in or you'd end up getting shot.
[00:39:51.637 --> 00:39:52.338]  Exactly.
[00:39:52.918 --> 00:39:56.260]  I mean, I know those stories about my family and business and people here in Texas.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.102]  The reason people were polite, the reason people didn't cheat or screw each other, because most people would kill you!
[00:40:01.822 --> 00:40:02.763]  Exactly.
[00:40:02.983 --> 00:40:07.825]  But now, it's just corruption's accepted and everything's falling apart where you can't even do basic business now.
[00:40:08.045 --> 00:40:08.866]  Can you speak to that?
[00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:17.770]  Well, it's so true, you know, because why should people do a fair deal when they see that the higher-ups are
[00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:18.369]  I don't know.
[00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:34.269]  You know, I talked about during the Great Depression what people looked like.
[00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:40.193]  And by the way, the other issue was back then we had a manufacturing base that built us out of the Great Depression.
[00:40:40.213 --> 00:40:43.535]  Well, not just looked like, their eyes were so much more alive.
[00:40:43.855 --> 00:40:45.757]  You look at people's eyes now, it's like they're dead.
[00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:46.938]  Did somebody suck their soul?
[00:40:47.358 --> 00:40:48.198]  Well, they did.
[00:40:48.218 --> 00:40:51.601]  Look at the junk food that they eat, the junk garbage that they watch.
[00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:54.843]  As I said, when you look back at society, just think of this.
[00:40:55.463 --> 00:40:59.186]  What's the dominant pop culture music?
[00:41:00.227 --> 00:41:04.952]  It was fashioned after the lowest of lowest common denominators.
[00:41:05.432 --> 00:41:06.073]  Criminals.
[00:41:06.613 --> 00:41:11.177]  The pants baggy because they wouldn't give them belts.
[00:41:11.337 --> 00:41:14.740]  Shoes flopping around because they wouldn't give them shoelaces.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.722]  This is who we emulate?
[00:41:16.742 --> 00:41:18.743]  A gangster quality?
[00:41:18.763 --> 00:41:21.606]  Of course that's what the nation's become.
[00:41:22.965 --> 00:41:25.486]  And you know, when you read Plato, you read the nation.
[00:41:25.506 --> 00:41:37.035]  The people of Sparta, of course, they were more aggressive because that's the kind of music they played, that's the kind of atmosphere that they created.
[00:41:37.295 --> 00:41:44.260]  And we've created a nation of gangsters, and the gangsters are at the bottom and the gangsters are at Wall Street.
[00:41:45.546 --> 00:41:47.487]  A ringer calls in a moment, but I did want to bring this up.
[00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:57.414]  Nancy Pelosi says to get America going, they need hundreds of millions of dollars, close to a billion, to have people have abortions or Planned Parenthood.
[00:41:57.994 --> 00:42:03.257]  Meanwhile, we have tens of millions of baby boomers are going to be retiring every year starting this year.
[00:42:03.558 --> 00:42:04.658]  We're a dying culture.
[00:42:04.678 --> 00:42:05.179]  Japan
[00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:08.220]  is telling their employees will pay you to have children.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.341]  Russia's saying the government will pay you to have children.
[00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:11.562]  The West is dying.
[00:42:11.602 --> 00:42:12.462]  Japan's dying.
[00:42:12.903 --> 00:42:15.664]  Meanwhile, in the United States, they say don't have children.
[00:42:16.104 --> 00:42:21.347]  Even Fox News says that that's the answer to the economy when the new blood is the future.
[00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:28.190]  Well, the new blood is the future, but the new blood that we're producing is pretty dismal blood.
[00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.972]  I mean, you look at this college industrial complex and what they've produced.
[00:42:34.588 --> 00:42:38.271]  You know, if they were doing such a great job, we wouldn't be in these problems.
[00:42:38.771 --> 00:42:43.655]  You know how many kids that I always meet and their parents tell me how special they are?
[00:42:43.675 --> 00:42:48.658]  And then when they're not little kids anymore and they reach their teens, they become amazing?
[00:42:49.399 --> 00:42:53.842]  I mean, you know, this is just a lot of, you know, more of the same.
[00:42:54.443 --> 00:42:55.744]  We need quality.
[00:42:56.324 --> 00:42:59.045]  We don't need quantity.
[00:42:59.385 --> 00:43:02.687]  And we're not producing quality in this country.
[00:43:03.427 --> 00:43:07.049]  As I said, it's the college industrial complex.
[00:43:07.389 --> 00:43:18.395]  And by the way, you're going to see a college crash as big as the real estate crash, as big as the retail crash, as big as the banking crash and the brokerage crash.
[00:43:18.735 --> 00:43:22.397]  They've all overexpanded and they're producing junk.
[00:43:23.474 --> 00:43:32.298]  And if they're not, I ask everyone, show me the greatness that the colleges have produced in the arts, in philosophy, in the sciences.
[00:43:32.658 --> 00:43:33.739]  Where is the greatness?
[00:43:33.779 --> 00:43:35.320]  Where's the great intellects?
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.282]  No, all they produce is skin-deep sports worship and people acting cool and acting tough.
[00:43:42.023 --> 00:43:42.783]  Exactly.
[00:43:44.304 --> 00:43:46.025]  And again, we're not trying to be negative, folks.
[00:43:46.325 --> 00:43:47.485]  It's a fact.
[00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:49.626]  This isn't about negative or positive.
[00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:50.967]  You know, show me.
[00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:52.501]  You know, show me.
[00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:53.962]  That's all I ask people to do.
[00:43:53.982 --> 00:43:55.102]  What was that term?
[00:43:55.122 --> 00:43:56.723]  What was that term in Italian about the parrot?
[00:43:57.303 --> 00:44:04.346]  My father used to say to me, I'd be babbling on because I always like to talk about, you know, what was going on in the world.
[00:44:04.386 --> 00:44:06.367]  And I was a little kid in my teens.
[00:44:06.927 --> 00:44:11.869]  And he'd look over at me and he'd give me a steely look and he'd say, Papa Gallo, parrot.
[00:44:12.389 --> 00:44:15.990]  He'd say, stop repeating what everybody else is saying and think for yourself.
[00:44:16.751 --> 00:44:18.371]  I heard a couple of those, Alex.
[00:44:18.911 --> 00:44:20.352]  And I respected my father.
[00:44:20.868 --> 00:44:21.489]  I don't know.
[00:44:37.894 --> 00:44:40.075]  You're entitled to believe what you want to believe.
[00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:42.417]  I'm entitled to believe what I believe in.
[00:44:42.677 --> 00:44:44.118]  Don't call me opinionated.
[00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:54.746]  Who's the head of the World Bank?
[00:44:54.906 --> 00:44:55.306]  Okay.
[00:44:55.846 --> 00:44:57.227]  How's the Federal Reserve operate?
[00:44:57.827 --> 00:45:00.488]  And they don't even know what it is, but they have an opinion.
[00:45:00.709 --> 00:45:04.490]  They can't find Iraq on a map, but they've got an opinion about the war.
[00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:18.017]  For me, when I spend my time researching, and I don't claim to have all the answers, but at least I'm studiously trying to be informed, and then these arrogant nobodies come up and tell us we don't know what we're talking about because they don't want to hear an educated opinion.
[00:45:18.672 --> 00:45:25.553]  Well, the motto of the Trends Research Institute, and we say it all the time, we put the information out there, but think for yourself.
[00:45:26.074 --> 00:45:27.114]  This is what we see.
[00:45:27.174 --> 00:45:29.174]  This is how we see it happening.
[00:45:29.774 --> 00:45:30.654]  You decide.
[00:45:31.215 --> 00:45:32.075]  Think for yourself.
[00:45:33.675 --> 00:45:35.055]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:35.295 --> 00:45:36.356]  Let's take a few calls.
[00:45:36.716 --> 00:45:38.436]  These will be all over the map, but that's fine.
[00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:41.197]  Tony in British Columbia, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[00:45:41.237 --> 00:45:41.577]  Go ahead.
[00:45:42.337 --> 00:45:43.537]  Yeah, hi Alex, Gerald.
[00:45:44.037 --> 00:45:44.497]  Hey, Tony.
[00:45:45.417 --> 00:45:47.218]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about...
[00:45:48.484 --> 00:45:53.986]  Well, this ties in with Biden's warning there, and it has to do with the crash on the Hudson.
[00:45:55.566 --> 00:45:56.907]  The airline crash?
[00:45:57.207 --> 00:45:57.547]  Yes.
[00:45:58.747 --> 00:46:01.088]  Okay, well, some interesting information has come out recently.
[00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:04.429]  It appears that that is not what it has appeared to be.
[00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:15.653]  Apparently, for starters, there were 26 bankers on that plane, 23 from the Bank of America and three from the Wells Fargo.
[00:46:16.297 --> 00:46:20.781]  Yeah, and now they're saying, even though Riley's saying it was a cover-up and could it be sabotage?
[00:46:21.081 --> 00:46:21.922]  I mean, who knows?
[00:46:22.002 --> 00:46:32.710]  But if you look statistically at politicians and executives, who even fly the same amount per capita as, say, a traveling salesman, they die many times more often in plane crashes.
[00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.872]  So we know they like to assassinate people that way.
[00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:36.814]  Had you heard anything about this, Gerald?
[00:46:37.274 --> 00:46:38.255]  No, I really haven't.
[00:46:38.655 --> 00:46:40.476]  Yeah, I've only heard a little, so I can't speak to it.
[00:46:41.017 --> 00:46:46.001]  Well, one other thing, besides the fact that these engines are built to survive bird strikes,
[00:46:47.170 --> 00:47:03.079]  Apparently the Russian intelligence working out of the Russian Embassy in New York there reported sounds of the Iglas-S hand-held ground-to-air missiles being shot at that particular day as well.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:15.947]  The way I see this tying in is I always thought that the Gaza incursion was a bit timely and I thought it was a run-up to an invasion in Iraq and if this had been a
[00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:22.593]  I think that the odds of going into Iran, unfortunately, keep increasing.
[00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:54.229]  And of course, you know, remember the Maine, the Gulf of Tonkin, Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:55.910]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale.
[00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.591]  I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:47:59.712 --> 00:48:01.292]  Read my lips, no new taxes.
[00:48:01.392 --> 00:48:02.953]  They put nothing past them.
[00:48:03.173 --> 00:48:03.914]  They'll do anything.
[00:48:04.634 --> 00:48:05.134]  Absolutely.
[00:48:05.174 --> 00:48:06.155]  Let's go to another caller.
[00:48:06.955 --> 00:48:07.915]  Dave in California.
[00:48:07.935 --> 00:48:09.376]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[00:48:09.396 --> 00:48:10.377]  Hi, guys.
[00:48:10.417 --> 00:48:11.057]  Great show.
[00:48:11.437 --> 00:48:13.438]  I've got two questions for both of you, and they're fast.
[00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:18.090]  One, where do you see the new head of global power developing?
[00:48:18.571 --> 00:48:23.523]  And two, if there, and I think we all agree, there's going to be some sort of global revolt.
[00:48:24.181 --> 00:48:29.546]  Where do you see it starting and would it be better if it started sooner rather than later in general?
[00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:32.189]  Let me just throw in a caveat here before Gerald gets into it.
[00:48:32.429 --> 00:48:34.431]  We already saw the Icelandic government collapse.
[00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:44.240]  We're already seeing other governments collapse, but the bankers just keep putting in like shark teeth another puppet politician, but over time people figure out that it's meet the new boss same as the old boss.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.183]  So Gerald, how do you see that unfolding?
[00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:52.344]  Well, you're right on with the Icelandic revolt, and also in Greece.
[00:48:52.384 --> 00:48:54.666]  That wasn't about shooting a 15-year-old kid.
[00:48:55.167 --> 00:48:57.690]  It was about the corruption and the failing of the society.
[00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:04.076]  We're also seeing it in Latvia and Lithuania, and it's going to go global, and it's going to happen here as well.
[00:49:04.597 --> 00:49:07.139]  And wait till we see the new head of the global power base.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.342]  He's right in the White House now.
[00:49:10.385 --> 00:49:13.127]  Presidential Reality Show, Episode 2.
[00:49:13.627 --> 00:49:15.429]  Obama moves into the White House.
[00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:27.237]  This is the concentration of power, and also we're going to see, in terms of geopolitical, we're also going to see a reigniting of the Cold War, we believe, as well.
[00:49:29.002 --> 00:49:30.142]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:49:30.542 --> 00:49:33.903]  Where do you see the new major power base specifically being?
[00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:42.345]  Europe centered around Russia and the monopolar system moving from Britain and England more towards Europe or to China?
[00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:47.166]  We know actually, you know, there are a lot of interesting things on that level as well.
[00:49:47.466 --> 00:49:57.568]  You know, there could be a come a time in the not too distant future, you know, within our lifetimes, you know, God willing, that in terms of God willing that I'm still around,
[00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:05.012]  As well as you and everyone listening, that we may see an end of the Euro happening in a couple of nations.
[00:50:05.512 --> 00:50:15.275]  And that's not unrealistic, because we're going to start seeing more nationalistic movements, where there's going to be a backlash against this centralized government's one thought rules all.
[00:50:16.215 --> 00:50:17.595]  Things don't happen that easily.
[00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:21.756]  They like to think they have the power to control everything, but often that they don't.
[00:50:22.277 --> 00:50:27.118]  And we could get a charismatic person in different countries, like Italy, Spain, Portugal,
[00:50:27.688 --> 00:50:32.612]  Even France, that say, we've had enough of the euro, we want to do this on our own.
[00:50:32.953 --> 00:50:33.693]  We have to.
[00:50:34.013 --> 00:50:35.295]  We can't go by your rules.
[00:50:35.635 --> 00:50:42.701]  Well, we see Europe trying to prop up what they're doing by putting a nationalist in from the Czech Republic trying to buy him off to go along with it.
[00:50:44.275 --> 00:50:45.456]  He's small potatoes.
[00:50:45.936 --> 00:50:46.516]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:47.457 --> 00:50:50.578]  I'm just saying, you see them trying to reach out to the conservatives right now.
[00:50:50.959 --> 00:50:51.339]  Stay there.
[00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:54.000]  Gerald Cilente, final segment with our amazing guest.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.543]  Be sure and check out his website, TrendsResearch.com, and my website's InfoWars.com.
[00:50:59.583 --> 00:51:00.003]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:00.943]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:07.247]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[00:51:07.747 --> 00:51:10.008]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:14.494]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:51:14.914 --> 00:51:19.876]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[00:51:20.296 --> 00:51:28.159]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:50.807]  Or call 877-394-6657.
[00:51:50.827 --> 00:51:51.207]  That's 877-394-6657.
[00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:51.887]  Or go to GetSeeds.net.
[00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:09.793]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:10.174 --> 00:52:12.155]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:12.815 --> 00:52:13.836]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:14.376 --> 00:52:14.876]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:15.176 --> 00:52:16.077]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:16.097 --> 00:52:17.518]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:17.538 --> 00:52:19.178]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:26.282]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:26.683 --> 00:52:27.123]  Some U.S.
[00:52:27.163 --> 00:52:32.786]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:33.486 --> 00:52:36.987]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:37.007 --> 00:52:39.788]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:03.263 --> 00:53:11.352]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:53:11.512 --> 00:53:15.897]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:53:16.077 --> 00:53:20.602]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:53:20.762 --> 00:53:22.164]  It's a documented fact.
[00:53:23.025 --> 00:53:29.631]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:41.643]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder also known as FPP with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:53:56.332 --> 00:53:56.532]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:11.877]  Hello Alex, hello Gerald, thank you very much for your gentleman's fine work.
[00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:14.898]  If someone wants to take a plunge into silver and gold
[00:54:37.887 --> 00:54:42.868]  I would assume that the bank is not the best place to store precious metals.
[00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:43.869]  What do you suggest?
[00:54:43.949 --> 00:54:45.489]  Where do you keep things like that?
[00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.310]  You know, I agree with you.
[00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:50.371]  A bank isn't the best place to store it.
[00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:55.572]  Without saying it out loud, use your ingenuity.
[00:54:55.632 --> 00:54:58.493]  If you don't tell anybody where it is, they're not going to find it.
[00:55:00.793 --> 00:55:03.974]  I'm a believer in gold, and I keep purchasing it.
[00:55:03.994 --> 00:55:04.775]  I have since 1978.
[00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:09.198]  And I think that's going to be gold.
[00:55:10.459 --> 00:55:15.163]  I don't know enough about silver, but I believe the people that talk well about it.
[00:55:16.243 --> 00:55:17.785]  But just put it someplace.
[00:55:17.825 --> 00:55:29.293]  I mean, if you have it in a coffee can or a paint can in your basement or the bottom of another paint can, $100,000 worth of gold isn't a lot of gold when it comes in coins.
[00:55:29.373 --> 00:55:31.335]  So you can hide it on your own.
[00:55:32.356 --> 00:55:35.058]  You were also talking about investing in other markets such as
[00:55:36.073 --> 00:55:44.199]  Alcohol and things during bad times, that there is a way to actually make money during challenging times.
[00:55:44.279 --> 00:55:45.720]  Did you want to expand on that at all?
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.982]  Yeah, I wouldn't say I suggested investing in alcohol.
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:51.544]  What we're saying is that those are going to be growth areas.
[00:55:51.944 --> 00:55:55.026]  The whole entertainment business is really going to flourish as well.
[00:55:55.507 --> 00:56:01.411]  You go back to the Great Depression, the hottest, happiest music this nation ever knew was in swing time.
[00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:17.777]  And by the way, one of the positive elements about the Obama election is that he is bringing a kind of decorum and class back, and people may start dressing up again, particularly a lot of the, you know, the gangster people that do follow him.
[00:56:18.537 --> 00:56:21.458]  And so, there's positives on that note as well.
[00:56:21.838 --> 00:56:27.760]  So, entertainment, and also, you know, in the restaurant business, there's opportunities.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:32.002]  You know, the greatest steak sandwich at an affordable price, that's the key.
[00:56:32.532 --> 00:56:34.093]  Affordable sophistication.
[00:56:34.213 --> 00:56:36.535]  Quality product at moderate price points.
[00:56:36.915 --> 00:56:37.776]  The best donut.
[00:56:38.076 --> 00:56:39.337]  You know, the best of anything.
[00:56:39.377 --> 00:56:42.559]  The best of the best is going to make money in this kind of economy.
[00:56:42.579 --> 00:56:46.442]  An economy implosion will force quality back instead of Chinese slave goods.
[00:56:47.122 --> 00:56:47.723]  Exactly.
[00:56:48.463 --> 00:56:49.984]  And then a lot of junk food.
[00:56:52.166 --> 00:56:54.387]  And a lot of locally made things will come back too.
[00:56:54.948 --> 00:56:56.289]  Local is where it's at.
[00:56:56.369 --> 00:56:59.491]  And by the way, that's the only way we're going to come back as a nation.
[00:57:00.152 --> 00:57:02.093]  Wall Street killed Main Street.
[00:57:02.458 --> 00:57:13.021]  They're the ones that put the deals together for these big conglomerates to build these horrendous-looking malls that sapped the life out of Main Street, which was the lifeblood of this country.
[00:57:13.442 --> 00:57:19.364]  Now that they're going under, they're leaving gaps behind that can be again filled by Main Street.
[00:57:19.704 --> 00:57:20.924]  So there's opportunities.
[00:57:21.024 --> 00:57:23.745]  Fortunes are going to be made during these times.
[00:57:25.453 --> 00:57:25.993]  Absolutely.
[00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:27.533]  Thank you so much, Gerald Salenti.
[00:57:27.553 --> 00:57:28.994]  I know you have a very busy schedule.
[00:57:29.014 --> 00:57:30.514]  We have a one-minute break here.
[00:57:30.854 --> 00:57:33.335]  You want to do five more minutes on the other side and take two or three more calls?
[00:57:33.895 --> 00:57:34.415]  Oh, sure.
[00:57:34.455 --> 00:57:34.955]  I'd love to.
[00:57:35.295 --> 00:57:35.795]  Okay, great.
[00:57:35.835 --> 00:57:39.556]  And for listeners out there, be sure and visit PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:39.916 --> 00:57:44.897]  We're streaming live right now at PrisonPlanet.tv for the folks that are on that site.
[00:57:44.977 --> 00:57:47.518]  And I'm telling you, invaluable information.
[00:57:48.338 --> 00:57:51.743]  Uh, from TrendsResearch.com.
[00:57:51.763 --> 00:57:54.786]  That's Trends with an S, Research.com, one word.
[00:57:55.127 --> 00:58:02.075]  Be sure and check it out, as well as PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, and my new film trailer, The Obama Deception.
[00:58:02.978 --> 00:58:04.338]  We're really doing Obama a favor.
[00:58:04.378 --> 00:58:07.199]  We're showing he's a puppet, he's a front man, he doesn't run anything.
[00:58:07.479 --> 00:58:09.820]  We're depoliticizing out of the left-right paradigm.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:19.343]  Because the elite want us to be distracted and diverted with the left-right paradigm to where we're caught up in the managers, the little front men, instead of the real shareholders in this global architecture.
[00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:20.884]  We have to shatter that.
[00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:25.225]  To then explain, hey, even if you love Obama, he isn't running the show.
[00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:26.825]  He's just there to pacify you.
[00:58:26.865 --> 00:58:28.786]  And I want to get Gerald Salendi's final comment on that.
[00:58:29.126 --> 00:58:36.087]  When we come back after this break in 70 seconds, we'll go to one or two more phone calls from Anthony Rocco, Bruce, and a few others.
[00:58:36.147 --> 00:58:39.568]  And then we've got Wayne Madsen on the NSA, formerly WorkForum.
[00:58:39.868 --> 00:58:40.308]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:46.590]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:50.211]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.254 --> 00:58:54.815]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:54.935 --> 00:58:59.556]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:59.676 --> 00:59:02.437]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:02.637 --> 00:59:05.498]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:05.678 --> 00:59:10.400]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.561]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:11.761 --> 00:59:14.663]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:15.004 --> 00:59:21.889]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:21.989 --> 00:59:25.112]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:41.964 --> 00:59:42.385]  Take action today.
[00:59:42.425 --> 00:59:44.246]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:55.876 --> 00:59:57.778]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:58.259 --> 01:00:01.042]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.189 --> 01:00:28.177]  Final segment with Gerald Celente, the master trends forecaster, predictor of the future.
[01:00:29.638 --> 01:00:36.465]  I know you spoke to this previously, but specifically, it's so important, I always make that point, you made it out of the gates, depoliticizing this.
[01:00:36.926 --> 01:00:38.487]  We're just talking facts.
[01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:42.331]  We're not in a... People are emailing me going, you're for Palin, you're for McCain.
[01:00:43.332 --> 01:00:43.992]  No, we weren't.
[01:00:44.313 --> 01:00:47.414]  We're saying either one of these groups, they were owned by the same people.
[01:00:47.754 --> 01:00:54.997]  How important is it to explain that to the American people, so they get out of this mindless Obama worship, so they can really look at real issues?
[01:00:55.037 --> 01:00:55.738]  Gerald Cilente.
[01:00:56.598 --> 01:01:01.680]  Well, it's very important, but even when you hit them with the facts, they make excuses.
[01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:05.022]  For example, you know, by their deeds you shall know them.
[01:01:05.602 --> 01:01:11.945]  So Obama, he promised to bring change to Washington, and he's brought in all the same old faces.
[01:01:12.372 --> 01:01:16.155]  from the Clinton administration and from the Bush administration.
[01:01:16.515 --> 01:01:19.537]  And I love it when he brings in the new diplomats.
[01:01:19.557 --> 01:01:20.878]  They call them veterans.
[01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:22.279]  How about old hacks?
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720]  Could they say that?
[01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:26.883]  So there's really no change here.
[01:01:27.243 --> 01:01:33.788]  But the people, when you give them the details again, they'll say, well, he's bringing inexperienced people.
[01:01:34.534 --> 01:01:38.298]  That's right, they were stampeded from the horror of Bush and jumped right into the arms of the new puppet.
[01:01:57.094 --> 01:02:07.758]  Exactly, and you know Bush is going to go down in history as the most hated, he will be, Bush will be the most hated living person in America come spring.
[01:02:08.277 --> 01:02:14.500]  Because of the disaster of this economy, and how easy it is to blame it all on Bush.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:35.630]  I was listening to the BBC last night, driving home on my XM radio, and it was like a 30-minute program about Bush leaving office, and it said that for the first time, his SMU Presidential Library office, the one raising the money, is secret, and that everybody hates him so much, even in Dallas, that it went for Obama, that they're being secretive about where their office even is.
[01:02:37.691 --> 01:02:38.431]  This is incredible.
[01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:40.472]  It is incredible.
[01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:47.015]  Look, when do you ever remember a president being booed off stage as he's leaving office?
[01:02:48.355 --> 01:02:49.335]  That's history making.
[01:02:49.355 --> 01:02:50.736]  That's never happened in this country.
[01:02:53.567 --> 01:03:00.209]  But they don't understand a PSYOP has been run on them, where they blamed it all on Bush, who deserved to be blamed, but he was just a front man.
[01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:01.269]  Oh, exactly.
[01:03:01.409 --> 01:03:03.510]  But then meanwhile, the elite have got to be laughing.
[01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:11.672]  But as Biden said, they've got 100 to 200 days until the mass delusion and euphoria wears off.
[01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:14.913]  But you're saying that the euphoria could go for 360 days?
[01:03:15.494 --> 01:03:16.334]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:16.414 --> 01:03:17.174]  It could spread.
[01:03:17.434 --> 01:03:18.495]  It could spread.
[01:03:18.535 --> 01:03:20.495]  The Obama love is really deep.
[01:03:20.775 --> 01:03:23.336]  Because what's going to happen, Alex, is the way we look at it,
[01:03:23.939 --> 01:03:29.461]  You're going to start seeing different kinds of elements of Obama seep into pop culture.
[01:03:30.402 --> 01:03:32.823]  And that's what keeps building the base.
[01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:37.945]  So you look beyond the politics, and again, this is the presidential reality show.
[01:03:38.225 --> 01:03:47.209]  I mean, when Oprah Winfrey put her support behind Obama, it changed overnight.
[01:03:47.709 --> 01:03:49.010]  The whole thing changed.
[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.251]  It was perfect stagecraft.
[01:03:51.849 --> 01:03:53.130]  And that's what we're looking at.
[01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:55.692]  And this country loves entertainment.
[01:03:57.814 --> 01:03:58.735]  Even if it kills them.
[01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.060]  And it doesn't even have to be great entertainment.
[01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:08.804]  Well, we didn't have time to get to calls, but we're going to let you go.
[01:04:08.824 --> 01:04:13.488]  I want to really thank you for spending time with us in the last 45 seconds.
[01:04:13.548 --> 01:04:14.348]  Any other predictions?
[01:04:15.389 --> 01:04:18.572]  Well, again, watch what's going on in the Middle East.
[01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:30.925]  Look for a bank holiday or some kind, some draconian action is going to be taken, we believe very swiftly, as Obama now has all his power in his hands right now.
[01:04:31.266 --> 01:04:35.050]  So those are the things that we're really looking at right now, at this moment.
[01:04:36.067 --> 01:04:36.728]  Absolutely.
[01:04:36.808 --> 01:04:37.448]  All right, folks.
[01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:41.231]  Be sure and check out the site, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:42.372]  TrendsResearch.com.

[01:04:49.117 --> 01:04:52.519]  And Mr. Salente, we will be talking to you very, very soon.
[01:04:52.539 --> 01:04:54.681]  Again, I appreciate all your time.
[01:04:54.881 --> 01:04:55.982]  God bless and Godspeed.
[01:04:56.422 --> 01:04:57.643]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:04:57.943 --> 01:04:58.143]  You bet.
[01:04:58.163 --> 01:04:59.444]  Let me just say bye to you during the break.
[01:04:59.885 --> 01:05:00.245]  All right.
[01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:01.266]  Wayne Madsen coming up.
[01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:05.569]  Hi, this is Steve Shane.
[01:05:10.499 --> 01:05:20.585]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:05:21.106 --> 01:05:28.750]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[01:05:29.151 --> 01:05:35.735]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[01:05:36.215 --> 01:05:37.656]  Food is an everyday need.
[01:05:38.256 --> 01:05:39.357]  The 3-Day Responder
[01:05:39.873 --> 01:05:43.355]  Is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[01:05:43.835 --> 01:05:46.017]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[01:05:47.257 --> 01:05:50.459]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.521]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:56.323]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:03.297 --> 01:06:09.660]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.021]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:12.682 --> 01:06:13.722]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:14.243 --> 01:06:14.763]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:15.043 --> 01:06:15.963]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:16.003 --> 01:06:17.384]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:17.404 --> 01:06:19.085]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:19.405 --> 01:06:26.149]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.989]  Some U.S.
[01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:32.712]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:33.372 --> 01:06:36.855]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:39.678]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:05.847]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[01:07:06.047 --> 01:07:07.148]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[01:07:07.168 --> 01:07:11.350]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.051]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function?
[01:07:14.211 --> 01:07:15.931]  Or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[01:07:16.172 --> 01:07:26.416]  The SinuPlus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[01:07:26.496 --> 01:07:26.996]  We're good to go.
[01:08:00.258 --> 01:08:05.421]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[01:08:05.901 --> 01:08:07.062]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[01:08:07.682 --> 01:08:08.423]  It's a depression.
[01:08:09.623 --> 01:08:12.565]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[01:08:13.926 --> 01:08:15.446]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[01:08:15.907 --> 01:08:16.947]  Banks are going bust.
[01:08:17.007 --> 01:08:18.928]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:21.149]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:23.731]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:25.760]  We know.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.822]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[01:08:27.902 --> 01:08:29.344]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[01:08:29.364 --> 01:08:38.634]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[01:08:38.894 --> 01:08:40.957]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[01:08:41.562 --> 01:08:42.283]  They're crazy.
[01:08:42.503 --> 01:08:45.525]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[01:08:45.905 --> 01:08:52.810]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:57.213]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything.
[01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.253]  Just leave us alone.
[01:08:58.494 --> 01:08:59.875]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[01:09:00.735 --> 01:09:01.836]  I want you to get mad!
[01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:03.982]  I don't want you to protest.
[01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:05.123]  I don't want you to riot.
[01:09:05.143 --> 01:09:08.086]  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[01:09:08.446 --> 01:09:12.750]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:15.613]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:17.955]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:19.396]  My life has value!
[01:09:21.018 --> 01:09:23.620]  I want you to get up now.
[01:09:24.481 --> 01:09:26.463]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:38.321]  I want you to get up right now, and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:51.975]  I want you to get up right now, get up, go to your window, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[01:10:00.033 --> 01:10:03.938]  I'm as fine as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[01:10:04.058 --> 01:10:11.546]  All right, for the next 25 minutes we are joined by Wayne Madsen, waynemadsenreport.com.
[01:10:14.429 --> 01:10:18.153]  And I wanted to get him on because now it's come out, what we already knew, what he already told us.
[01:10:19.144 --> 01:10:21.207]  Well, we knew from James Bamford and others, but now they admit it.
[01:10:21.547 --> 01:10:23.771]  They're not just listening to troops overseas in the U.S.
[01:10:23.791 --> 01:10:23.951]  here.
[01:10:23.971 --> 01:10:26.354]  They listen to politicians, media people.
[01:10:26.374 --> 01:10:27.997]  They're laughing at their phone sex.
[01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.580]  It's all over MSNBC, CNN.
[01:10:31.081 --> 01:10:32.883]  But it's continuing under Obama.
[01:10:32.904 --> 01:10:34.766]  He's just doing it with a little bit kinder, gentler.
[01:10:35.727 --> 01:10:51.143]  So a lot of things have changed the last two years from Bush saying, we don't spy on anybody, we only have warrants, to, oh we only listen to Al Qaeda calling America, to we only listen to the troops, to we only listen to Congress, to we only listen to all of you, and where all this is going and how bad it really is, and any other little political tidbits.
[01:10:51.684 --> 01:10:58.726]  Because a lot of times you're watching intelligence hearings in Congress, you're watching serious things happen on the Hill, you look in the background of the press gallery, you'll see Wayne Madsen.
[01:10:59.006 --> 01:11:01.067]  So he's always got new important information for us.
[01:11:01.327 --> 01:11:05.508]  Formerly worked with the NSA and consulted other major security and surveillance agencies.
[01:11:05.808 --> 01:11:06.968]  Wayne, good to have you on with us.
[01:11:07.448 --> 01:11:08.789]  Hi Alex, good to be with you.
[01:11:09.809 --> 01:11:12.490]  What's going on with the NSA these days and the other agencies?
[01:11:13.288 --> 01:11:15.830]  Well, we've learned quite a bit.
[01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:28.961]  First of all, we know what this classified program was that Alberto Gonzalez was sanctioned for because he took some folders home with this classified term on the cover.
[01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:30.422]  He wasn't supposed to do that.
[01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:33.044]  It's Stellar Wind.
[01:11:33.124 --> 01:11:35.005]  Stellar Wind is the name of the program.
[01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:41.651]  This is the program that John Ashcroft lifted his head from his hospital pillow.
[01:11:42.316 --> 01:11:42.956]  I don't know.
[01:12:04.185 --> 01:12:11.126]  The existence, and he comes from a long line of FBI agents, this prosecutor.
[01:12:11.366 --> 01:12:15.087]  He, of course, had his house invaded by federal agents.
[01:12:16.147 --> 01:12:32.790]  They, you know, questioned his children, seized his computers, his kids' computers, and put them through the wringer just like they did to Russ Tice, the former NSA analyst who has recently come on television again and spoken about the further details
[01:12:33.354 --> 01:12:33.594]  I don't
[01:12:57.409 --> 01:13:05.912]  The telephone and email intercepts and fax intercepts, but also NSA compiling records of credit card transactions.
[01:13:06.732 --> 01:13:11.454]  Is Obama going to keep Hayden at the CIA?
[01:13:11.614 --> 01:13:11.814]  No.
[01:13:12.394 --> 01:13:14.074]  It's going to Leon Panetta.
[01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:21.997]  Many people I've spoken to think Panetta is a good choice, even though he's not formally CIA.
[01:13:22.137 --> 01:13:25.758]  I knew Panetta was coming in, but what's going to happen with Hayden?
[01:13:26.328 --> 01:13:29.629]  Hayden has retired as an Air Force General.
[01:13:29.949 --> 01:13:32.470]  Gates asked him to do that last year.
[01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:50.756]  Hayden will probably go off and work for one of these military intelligence contractors, violating all the strictures against revolving doors, which under the Bush administration all that went by the wayside, and even now we're seeing
[01:13:51.746 --> 01:13:57.228]  A waiver's being granted to lobbyists by Obama, including the Deputy Defense Secretary.
[01:13:57.248 --> 01:14:07.230]  And as I pointed out just the other day, Janet Napolitano's Deputy Homeland Security Secretary is this woman named Jane Hall Lute, L-U-T-E.
[01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:10.251]  The name was very familiar to me.
[01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:14.512]  I went back and just checked at a sanity check, and sure enough, it's what I thought.
[01:14:15.172 --> 01:14:16.893]  She is the wife of Bush's
[01:14:17.898 --> 01:14:23.203]  This is what I want to hear from you specifically as you work with the NSA and you know all these people.
[01:14:38.823 --> 01:14:48.107]  Bush was bad, and you were one of his biggest critics, and you had hoped that, I know that Obama would be better, but you're an honest guy, so now you're criticizing.
[01:14:49.107 --> 01:15:02.513]  He's going over and above to pack it full of the worst Clintonistas and the worst Bushies, so can you specifically walk through, not just the new Deputy of Defense being the Raytheon minion, but Mitchell being on the Saudi and other payroll.
[01:15:03.353 --> 01:15:05.154]  I mean, this guy, why is Obama
[01:15:05.914 --> 01:15:12.156]  Going back on one of his most basic things, does he just think Obama-mania will basically gloss over all that?
[01:15:12.176 --> 01:15:22.038]  And specifically, again in your own words, go back over all these lobbyists and this new individual you were just talking about being the wife of the Bush war czar.
[01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:34.701]  Well, what I see happening here is Obama is torn between two sides of the Democratic Party and what Howard Dean used to call the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.
[01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:53.910]  This was the FDR, the John Kennedy, even the LBJ-type Democrats, not pro-corporate, always pro-union, always pro-worker, always pro-the-little-guy, always trying to get the worker another ten cents an hour.
[01:15:53.930 --> 01:16:04.877]  He's torn between those Democrats and these corporate Democrats, this Democratic Leadership Council, free trade, international trade, all this business.
[01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:05.619]  I don't
[01:16:25.236 --> 01:16:25.696]  We're good to go.
[01:16:48.925 --> 01:16:55.287]  Traditional Democrats, I don't think they understand what the hidden agenda, or not so hidden agenda, of these corporate Democrats are.
[01:16:55.527 --> 01:16:59.168]  It's really not much different than the Republicans under George Bush.
[01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:00.789]  Okay, I interrupted you.
[01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:06.051]  Go back over this new lady's name that worked for the War Czar, and then more on the lobbyist.
[01:17:06.691 --> 01:17:08.111]  Yes, Jane Hall Lute.
[01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:14.133]  She was a lobbyist when she was the... She's a retired military officer.
[01:17:14.153 --> 01:17:15.714]  Her husband is this General Lute.
[01:17:16.495 --> 01:17:18.657]  She worked for the Association of the U.S.
[01:17:18.777 --> 01:17:24.322]  Army, where she was basically lobbying the Army for all these defense contractors.
[01:17:24.362 --> 01:17:30.027]  So she's very similar to this guy, William Lynn, over at the Pentagon, who came out of Raytheon.
[01:17:31.148 --> 01:17:38.995]  So I guess the deal is Obama says, we won't have all these lobbyists, but now it seems like he's issuing waivers.
[01:17:39.717 --> 01:17:42.098]  Sort of like DC issues parking tickets.
[01:17:42.898 --> 01:17:43.678]  Let's explain.
[01:17:44.238 --> 01:17:50.400]  He's not just hiring lobbyists and people that gave large campaign contributions to fill up his administration.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:56.262]  He's going further to levels of having to sign waivers because of national security rules.
[01:17:56.642 --> 01:18:00.003]  So he's going above and beyond breaking his promise.
[01:18:00.023 --> 01:18:00.983]  Can you explain that to people?
[01:18:01.516 --> 01:18:06.499]  Yeah, well, what he's doing is he's issuing these waivers to these individuals.
[01:18:06.879 --> 01:18:14.103]  Although he has these rules against hiring lobbyists, these individuals are so important for national security reasons, he has to grant them a waiver.
[01:18:14.404 --> 01:18:19.547]  And what he's getting from the Republicans, oh, well, if it's for national security, well, that's a different matter.
[01:18:19.587 --> 01:18:30.093]  So he got John McCain to go along with this, and he got Lindsey Graham to go along with this, and this is his way of basically preventing any criticism from the Republicans.
[01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:39.335]  Although, you know, he's getting some from the Democratic Party, but it's that wing of the Democratic Party that has now been marginalized by the Rahm Emanuel.
[01:18:40.137 --> 01:18:44.318]  And the Hillary Clintons and these other people.
[01:18:44.378 --> 01:18:52.859]  And it's starting to appear that they didn't want Carolyn Kennedy in the Senate because she is definitely not in that corporate wing of the Democratic Party.
[01:18:52.879 --> 01:18:53.759]  She's like her father.
[01:18:53.779 --> 01:18:55.460]  She's a traditional Democrat.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:08.062]  So, I mean, just with a little more than a week in office, would you say it's fair to say that Obama is signaling that he's going with the high-powered, globalist arm of the Democratic Party and the neocons?
[01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.814]  It seems that way to me.
[01:19:13.535 --> 01:19:18.879]  This honeymoon was over before they checked into the motel room.
[01:19:21.161 --> 01:19:25.664]  This was never a honeymoon because Pelosi doesn't like Emmanuel.
[01:19:25.704 --> 01:19:29.707]  Emmanuel, I don't know if you know about this, but the other day this was reported in the New York Times.
[01:19:30.049 --> 01:19:34.736]  There was a cabinet meeting, and Emmanuel was sitting there at the cabinet meeting, cracking his knuckles.
[01:19:34.876 --> 01:19:38.020]  And Obama looked to him and said, Mom, I wish you would stop that.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.202]  I find that annoying.
[01:19:39.736 --> 01:19:42.938]  Emmanuel gets up and cracks his knuckles right in Obama's ear.
[01:19:43.218 --> 01:19:44.319]  Obama doesn't say anything.
[01:19:44.339 --> 01:19:48.802]  He should have cleared the cabinet room out and said, uh, look, everybody leave.
[01:19:48.862 --> 01:19:50.142]  I need to have a discussion with him.
[01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.584]  And right then and there he said, that's disrespectful to the office of the president.
[01:19:53.644 --> 01:19:55.285]  Oh my God, I haven't heard about this.
[01:19:55.365 --> 01:19:56.466]  Wayne, Wayne, stay there.
[01:19:56.846 --> 01:20:01.809]  I mean, Emmanuel's the guy that takes steak knives and goes, die, die, die, while he's stabbing things.
[01:20:01.849 --> 01:20:02.310]  Stay with us.
[01:20:03.356 --> 01:20:06.959]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?

[01:21:10.641 --> 01:21:12.401]  Or at least we thought we did.

[01:24:14.628 --> 01:24:16.069]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:19.472 --> 01:24:21.314]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:22.174 --> 01:24:23.636]  Will it be easier on you?
[01:24:24.807 --> 01:24:33.532]  But you got George Bush to blame.
[01:24:35.514 --> 01:24:37.775]  The problem is these men are puppets.
[01:24:38.235 --> 01:24:44.119]  The military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about is in full control and it's bought and paid for by offshore banks.
[01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:49.042]  Wayne Madsen will be with us until 40 after them and take calls into the news blitz.
[01:24:49.082 --> 01:24:50.202]  Wayne Madsen
[01:24:54.710 --> 01:25:09.908]  Please break down this IDF soldier, this foreign asset, Rahm Emanuel, the architect of Obama, the architect of Blagojevich, who, when Clinton won re-election, well, I mean, start at the beginning and tell us this new development.
[01:25:10.989 --> 01:25:24.295]  With him dominating Obama, because I did see a story in the Israeli papers with his father saying, basically, my son runs the White House now, he won't be some dirty Arab, I don't mean that, he was saying that, sweeping up the White House.
[01:25:24.335 --> 01:25:28.237]  So, a lot of dominance and arrogance and chutzpah going on.
[01:25:28.917 --> 01:25:30.698]  Yeah, he's a very arrogant guy.
[01:25:30.718 --> 01:25:34.340]  He served in the Israeli Defense Force during Desert Storm when
[01:25:34.813 --> 01:25:37.174]  You know, there were hundreds of thousands of U.S.
[01:25:37.214 --> 01:25:41.155]  troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and southern Iraq.
[01:25:41.195 --> 01:25:44.176]  He thought it would be better to serve in Israel.
[01:25:44.236 --> 01:25:56.460]  His Democratic opponent, or at least supporters of his Democratic opponent in his 2002 congressional race, which was to replace Blagojevich, who had served in that house.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.201]  And I think Blagojevich has a lot of dirt on Emanuel.
[01:25:59.541 --> 01:26:02.602]  They're talking about Patrick Fitzgerald having dirt on Blagojevich.
[01:26:03.372 --> 01:26:05.894]  I think that Fitzgerald is a dirty prosecutor.
[01:26:06.454 --> 01:26:07.394]  He's very political.
[01:26:07.474 --> 01:26:10.116]  He won't look at Emanuel, but he's more than happy.
[01:26:10.236 --> 01:26:14.078]  Fitzgerald is looking at Blagojevich, and I think that gets back to this
[01:26:14.677 --> 01:26:15.077]  I don't
[01:26:33.553 --> 01:26:37.475]  And he said, also, you know, he's a dual citizen.
[01:26:37.576 --> 01:26:39.417]  He's a citizen of Israel as well.
[01:26:39.717 --> 01:26:43.319]  And of course, you know, Emmanuel and all his minions cried foul.
[01:26:43.519 --> 01:26:46.461]  Oh, that's anti-Semitic, that's this, that's that, you can't say that.
[01:26:46.861 --> 01:26:50.864]  But nevertheless, that's what supporters of his opponent said.
[01:26:50.904 --> 01:27:02.431]  So this 5th Congressional District in Chicago is, you know, they know the story, and I think they know the story on Blagojevich, and they know the real story on Blagojevich, not what Fitzgerald and the media are saying.
[01:27:02.816 --> 01:27:16.004]  And also the real story on Emanuel, and I think if we knew what was really going on in that district, we would be a lot more sympathetic to Blagojevich, and a lot less sympathetic or, you know, a lot less supportive, anyway, of Emanuel.
[01:27:16.344 --> 01:27:27.531]  Anyway, Emanuel, this other day, I mean, this thing with him cracking his knuckles, you know, showing not only disrespect to Obama, but to the office of the presidency.
[01:27:27.887 --> 01:27:31.991]  And the New York Times said, you know, reported, well, Emanuel likes to joke around a lot.
[01:27:32.131 --> 01:27:33.492]  Well, no, that's not his history.
[01:27:33.532 --> 01:27:36.555]  This guy Emanuel's a bit of a Karl Rove type person.
[01:27:36.595 --> 01:27:37.716]  He's a sociopath.
[01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:39.558]  He uses foul language.
[01:27:39.598 --> 01:27:42.741]  He claims he's a pious Orthodox Jew, but he uses foul language.
[01:27:44.562 --> 01:27:52.209]  He also, at another cabinet meeting, there was some congressional people there, and he sat there and thumbed his nose at them.
[01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.831]  And there was a picture of this, of course.
[01:27:54.721 --> 01:27:59.765]  This guy is just more poison in the White House.
[01:28:00.886 --> 01:28:02.948]  I call him Obama's Karl Rove.
[01:28:03.248 --> 01:28:05.850]  And the last thing this country needed was another Karl Rove.
[01:28:06.586 --> 01:28:09.787]  Whether he's a Democrat or not is immaterial.
[01:28:09.987 --> 01:28:11.428]  We just don't need people like that.
[01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:12.608]  Well, Wayne, start over.
[01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:13.709]  You got interrupted by the break.
[01:28:13.769 --> 01:28:17.070]  Specifically, go through the story that the New York Times reported on.
[01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:17.951]  I wasn't aware of it.
[01:28:18.671 --> 01:28:20.512]  Explain what happened with Obama.
[01:28:20.552 --> 01:28:21.652]  That's very disrespectful.
[01:28:23.353 --> 01:28:23.593]  Right.
[01:28:24.153 --> 01:28:25.293]  It was a Cabinet meeting.
[01:28:26.754 --> 01:28:28.355]  Emanuel was at the Cabinet meeting.
[01:28:28.375 --> 01:28:31.076]  The new Cabinet officials were there.
[01:28:31.516 --> 01:28:32.536]  Other White House officials.
[01:28:32.596 --> 01:28:34.417]  And Emanuel starts cracking his knuckles.
[01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:39.014]  And Obama said, Mom, I find that annoying.
[01:28:39.074 --> 01:28:39.996]  Would you please stop?
[01:28:40.576 --> 01:28:48.727]  Instead of stopping, he stands up and takes his hand over next to Obama's ear and cracks his knuckles in his ear and laughs.
[01:28:49.147 --> 01:28:51.130]  I mean, right then and there I would have fired the guy.
[01:28:54.557 --> 01:28:58.839]  Wayne, isn't that the equivalent of a bigger dog urinating on a smaller dog to dominate it?
[01:28:58.859 --> 01:29:01.239]  I mean, isn't that a sign of dominance?
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:07.962]  That is, and that's the way it's being viewed as here, that, you know, who's the real guy in charge?
[01:29:07.982 --> 01:29:09.542]  Is it Emanuel?
[01:29:09.702 --> 01:29:10.843]  Is it Obama?
[01:29:11.143 --> 01:29:18.726]  Now, you know, Emanuel, he knows, I mean, this guy, first of all, his ego knows no bounds.
[01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:22.707]  He actually, the reason he doesn't like, he doesn't get along with Pelosi is
[01:29:23.038 --> 01:29:25.198]  He wanted Pelosi, he wanted the Speakership.
[01:29:25.719 --> 01:29:33.840]  And he's made no secret of the fact, Emanuel has, that he wants to eventually become President of the United States.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.941]  But a lot of people think that he is the de facto President of the United States.
[01:29:36.961 --> 01:29:37.961]  Stay there, stay there Wayne.
[01:29:38.001 --> 01:29:42.142]  I want to recap that when we come back and get into any other big developments with your ear on the ground.
[01:29:42.222 --> 01:29:45.502]  He is a national security reporter, formerly worked for the NSA.
[01:29:45.802 --> 01:29:46.562]  He's Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:46.582 --> 01:29:47.983]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:29:48.023 --> 01:29:48.963]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:49.583]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:53.482 --> 01:29:56.470]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:57.413 --> 01:30:00.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.414 --> 01:30:07.056]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:30:07.116 --> 01:30:12.759]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:30:12.839 --> 01:30:16.901]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:30:17.181 --> 01:30:19.483]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:30:19.643 --> 01:30:25.546]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:30:25.606 --> 01:30:26.246]  We're good to go!
[01:30:54.895 --> 01:30:59.101]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:59.121 --> 01:31:00.242]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:13.891]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:14.411 --> 01:31:14.911]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:15.212 --> 01:31:16.172]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:16.192 --> 01:31:17.513]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:17.553 --> 01:31:19.234]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:26.319]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:27.159]  Some U.S.
[01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:32.843]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:33.543 --> 01:31:37.006]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:37.026 --> 01:31:39.848]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:03.851]  We're good.
[01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.790]  I think so.
[01:32:44.978 --> 01:32:48.601]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.
[01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:52.143]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.

[01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:13.774]  I'm going to go back to Wayne Madsen here in a moment, jam in some final news and final calls after he leaves us here in about 10 minutes.
[01:33:14.354 --> 01:33:20.016]  Before I go back to our guest, I want to tell you about a great sponsor we've got, Survivalist Seeds.
[01:33:20.036 --> 01:33:24.577]  The website's www.survivalistseeds.com.
[01:33:24.617 --> 01:33:25.578]  That's survivalistseeds.com.
[01:33:26.798 --> 01:33:28.480]  Knowing that something's coming is not the solution.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.022]  Preparing for what's coming is the answer.
[01:33:30.423 --> 01:33:32.405]  Get 7 years of healthy food for pennies a pound.
[01:33:32.425 --> 01:33:34.548]  100% heirloom seeds.
[01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:36.230]  Grow your own food.
[01:33:36.471 --> 01:33:38.834]  Eliminate your dependence on society.
[01:33:38.874 --> 01:33:41.717]  Get 15,000 heirloom vegetable seeds for just...
[01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:49.553]  for a seven-year family supply for just $129 and receive a free how-to DVD instructional video.
[01:33:49.893 --> 01:33:53.214]  Get seeds five times cheaper than the GM trash sold at Walmart.
[01:33:53.754 --> 01:33:56.615]  Same-day priority shipping by USPS.
[01:33:56.655 --> 01:33:57.436]  Here is their number 620-637-2978.
[01:33:57.456 --> 01:33:57.516]  620-637-2978.
[01:33:57.576 --> 01:34:03.598]  Again, without a long-term food solution, you will starve if society totally breaks down or become a slave.
[01:34:12.523 --> 01:34:18.113]  The globalist scientists are genetically engineering and modifying seeds to make us sick.
[01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:19.516]  Sick people are easy to control.
[01:34:19.576 --> 01:34:22.962]  Again, survivalistseeds.com or 620-637-7000.
[01:34:26.357 --> 01:34:26.397]  620-637-2978
[01:34:56.577 --> 01:35:01.903]  Well, I mean, even some of his closest friends are saying he's the second most powerful person in the country right now.
[01:35:01.923 --> 01:35:03.264]  You know, whatever happened to Joe Biden?
[01:35:03.284 --> 01:35:04.005]  He's the Vice President.
[01:35:17.731 --> 01:35:28.195]  But yeah, I mean, I think the other reason he did this little number with the crack in his knuckles is, you know, the House and Senate leadership was also at that meeting.
[01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:36.998]  I think it was a message to them, you know, basically saying, look, you tangle with me, you're tangling with Obama, and I'm the guy who's calling the shots around here.
[01:35:37.078 --> 01:35:41.439]  So I don't think anything this guy, I think this guy is very premeditated in what he does.
[01:35:42.019 --> 01:35:43.820]  And I think he is.
[01:35:44.628 --> 01:35:46.810]  He is going to get Obama in a lot of trouble.
[01:35:47.290 --> 01:36:06.545]  People think that Joe Biden will, because Joe Biden doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, as we know with that incident with the swearing in of the White House staff, where he was cracking a joke about Chief Justice Roberts, and Obama looked at him like he could, you know, have taken him in the Oval Office and given him a fist beating.
[01:36:06.966 --> 01:36:10.048]  But anyway, no, it's very clear that
[01:36:10.413 --> 01:36:11.434]  We're good to go.
[01:36:26.349 --> 01:36:28.710]  And you know, he's alienated Howard Dean.
[01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:29.630]  Howard Dean's out.
[01:36:29.670 --> 01:36:31.610]  He's alienated Nancy Pelosi.
[01:36:32.130 --> 01:36:37.391]  And I think he will continue to alienate other people in the Democratic Party.
[01:36:37.511 --> 01:36:40.192]  By the way, Wayne, you're not just saying this.
[01:36:40.252 --> 01:36:45.393]  I saw a couple headlines that said the second most powerful man in America, and it was the New York Times.
[01:36:45.453 --> 01:36:46.553]  I didn't read the whole article.
[01:36:46.593 --> 01:36:49.654]  Is that the same one where he's cracking the knuckles?
[01:36:50.359 --> 01:36:51.000]  Yes, yes.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:58.106]  There was a reference to it in there, but other references in other newspapers to Emanuel's power.
[01:36:58.826 --> 01:37:02.169]  And, you know, he's just known as this enforcer.
[01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:09.415]  And even John Podesta, who was the head of the transition team, interestingly enough, he was Clinton's chief of staff.
[01:37:09.455 --> 01:37:12.398]  He had the same job that Emanuel has under Obama.
[01:37:13.098 --> 01:37:16.101]  Podesta is nowhere to be found in this administration.
[01:37:16.161 --> 01:37:17.302]  I know John Podesta.
[01:37:18.733 --> 01:37:26.357]  His political ways and his mannerisms are 180 out from this guy, Emanuel.
[01:37:26.417 --> 01:37:29.459]  Emanuel is just a nasty guy.
[01:37:30.599 --> 01:37:33.621]  Obama talked about bringing change to Washington.
[01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:37.582]  Well, this guy Emanuel is a former ballet dancer.
[01:37:37.642 --> 01:37:47.007]  Not to impugn ballet dancers, but anyway, this guy is like Karl Rove wearing a tutu.
[01:37:49.537 --> 01:37:52.440]  Now that's a good one right there, if it wasn't so horrible and so serious.
[01:37:53.401 --> 01:37:57.524]  Yeah, the thought is not very good.
[01:37:58.345 --> 01:37:59.686]  Not a very good visual on that.
[01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:05.992]  Alright, getting back to the serious issues here though, in closing...
[01:38:07.307 --> 01:38:36.687]  Rahm Emanuel brags that he helped craft the deception in 2006, and that he helped shoot down Democratic candidates that were truly anti-war, and ensured that kind of neocon, neolib, pro-war clones, not just for Iraq, but for Iran, got into Congress in 2006 on that anti-war tide, and he has made a lot of noises about wanting to go into Iran, and then a week and a half ago, Hillary met with the
[01:38:37.827 --> 01:38:44.428]  Leaders of Israel, and it was in the news, saying in a secret meeting she made agreements to back Israel up, but they wouldn't say what that was.
[01:38:44.528 --> 01:38:50.670]  So, A, the final question here, Wayne, than any other info you've got you want to drop on us, any inside info on other subjects.
[01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:58.591]  A, do you see Rahm Emanuel, you know, continuing to stoke the fires of pro-war and militarism as a hawk?
[01:38:59.171 --> 01:39:06.193]  And then, B, what's the inside scoop you've got of any on what went on in that secret meeting in Israel?
[01:39:07.253 --> 01:39:13.438]  Well, I believe that Manuel was the guy who pushed for George Mitchell to be the special envoy to the Middle East.
[01:39:13.458 --> 01:39:15.799]  It's interesting that Mitchell's being criticized.
[01:39:15.839 --> 01:39:18.841]  He's not going to Gaza, where you would think he would go.
[01:39:19.882 --> 01:39:21.143]  He won't talk to Hamas.
[01:39:21.183 --> 01:39:25.166]  He's not going to Syria, where Hamas has its political headquarters.
[01:39:25.186 --> 01:39:28.769]  He's not even going to Lebanon, which is the land of his forebears.
[01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:30.570]  George Mitchell is Lebanese-American.
[01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:36.134]  But a lot of people are pointing to the fact that Mitchell was the chairman of the board of Disney Corporation.
[01:39:36.539 --> 01:39:36.999]  I don't know.
[01:39:55.599 --> 01:40:10.070]  We're involved in bringing Mitchell into Disney, and he got a lot of money from them, and now he's been made the special envoy to the Middle East, and I think the thought that he may be neutral or unbiased, I think people are putting too much into that.
[01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:16.654]  Just because he's Lebanese-American doesn't mean he's not bought and paid for, and it certainly looks like his time at Disney
[01:40:17.882 --> 01:40:21.484]  That he was bought and he was paid handsomely for it.
[01:40:22.245 --> 01:40:41.838]  Emanuel, but getting back to Emanuel, yes, he's the guy, when he was the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, withheld funds to anyone who was opposed to the war in Iraq, or rattling the sabers with Iran, and also saying they were against the Patriot Act.
[01:40:42.218 --> 01:40:46.941]  So this guy has significant neocon credentials right down the line.
[01:40:47.762 --> 01:40:55.566]  And he's cracking his knuckles in the president's ears when the president says don't do it in front of the leadership of Congress.
[01:40:55.606 --> 01:40:58.867]  I mean, if that isn't a bully saying, hey, I'm your boss.
[01:40:59.428 --> 01:41:04.510]  I mean, just in my own business, if an employee did that, or if I was the president, I'd say, you know what?
[01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:06.051]  You're fired as chief of staff.
[01:41:06.551 --> 01:41:08.492]  But that's showing that he can't do that.
[01:41:08.532 --> 01:41:09.172]  He's dominated.
[01:41:09.652 --> 01:41:10.093]  Exactly.
[01:41:10.133 --> 01:41:12.914]  And he does it in front of the Congress, which lets them know
[01:41:13.847 --> 01:41:23.274]  That, you know, Emanuel's in fact in charge, and he does it in front of members of the cabinet, which lets them know, look, you go through me to get to this guy.
[01:41:23.394 --> 01:41:38.224]  So, you know, everybody thought that Obama was going to be this new kind of leader, and instead of being what I think he needs to be, I think he needs to be like a Marine drill sergeant and start just, you know,
[01:41:38.772 --> 01:41:38.893]  It's
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:55.243]  I mean, you were early on an Obama supporter, certainly 180 degrees from Bush.
[01:41:56.404 --> 01:41:59.947]  How would you summarize the first 7-8 days in office?
[01:42:00.007 --> 01:42:03.529]  It looks like a complete betrayal of everything Obama said he would do.
[01:42:03.549 --> 01:42:07.952]  And we can't even blame Obama, because he's really surrounded by a bunch of thugs.
[01:42:08.452 --> 01:42:08.732]  Right.
[01:42:09.133 --> 01:42:09.333]  Right.
[01:42:09.573 --> 01:42:12.435]  I said on day one he exceeded my expectations.
[01:42:13.123 --> 01:42:18.126]  He said, look, the Attorney General will determine what happens to presidential records.
[01:42:18.186 --> 01:42:22.149]  That means we could finally see what's in the Reagan papers about Poppy Bush.
[01:42:22.549 --> 01:42:27.933]  He put teeth back into the Freedom of Information Act, closing Guantanamo.
[01:42:28.333 --> 01:42:29.714]  We're not going to torture.
[01:42:29.954 --> 01:42:31.896]  I said, day one, I gave him an A plus.
[01:42:32.276 --> 01:42:37.980]  But the days went by, it went to an A minus, a B plus, maybe a B minus.
[01:42:38.467 --> 01:43:02.632]  And now I'm looking at Adam as a B- or a C+, and I don't know how much lower it's going to go, but he started out okay, but I'm really afraid that he's being manipulated by the likes of Rahm Emanuel and Emanuel's good buddy David Axelrod, who's in charge of policy, and some of these other Chicago... Increasingly, these guys are being called the Chicago Mafia.
[01:43:03.274 --> 01:43:04.795]  Well, what about Pat Robertson?
[01:43:05.255 --> 01:43:11.459]  We've seen Pat Robertson say, I'm pleasantly pleased, do whatever Obama says, he will save us, God told me.
[01:43:11.819 --> 01:43:12.700]  Bizarre statements.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.382]  We've got Max Boot and all the neocons saying, hey, we like Obama.
[01:43:16.862 --> 01:43:22.205]  And then now that he's saying that, I may keep the Cheney powers, the Republicans are going, see, we were right.
[01:43:22.586 --> 01:43:25.447]  Now that you're in power, you know we were doing what was right.
[01:43:25.748 --> 01:43:29.310]  When in reality, it's a bait and switch with Rahm Emanuel, who's just a Democratic neocon.
[01:43:29.992 --> 01:43:46.922]  It is, and look, Rahm Emanuel has to be a great, you know, he must love this unitary executive because now he's got the powers, the chain he once enjoyed, and I just don't see Obama standing up to this guy, Emanuel.
[01:43:47.762 --> 01:43:58.188]  I would have thought that, you know, I mean even Andy Card, as all the faults that Andrew Card had with Bush, and this guy Joshua Bolton, the last guy, nobody ever
[01:43:58.626 --> 01:44:17.117]  I've heard of him, you know, or heard from him, or hardly seen him anywhere, but it certainly looks like, in the case of Emanuel, that Emanuel is sort of like the Prime Minister, that you go through him to get to Obama for almost anything in the government.
[01:44:17.197 --> 01:44:26.663]  And I think that's, we're looking at Emanuel, we're looking at really a quasi, you know, he made his money on Wall Street.
[01:44:27.905 --> 01:44:34.668]  He was a lawyer for Wall Street operation and you know the question is how much did he benefit from this fraud on Wall Street?
[01:44:34.849 --> 01:44:41.492]  And now he's helping hand over the entire government in bailout too to give governmental power to the private Federal Reserve.
[01:44:42.272 --> 01:44:49.415]  Yeah, the only good thing about Emanuel is he creates a lot of enemies and if he gets a lot of a lot of these enemies start to talk to one another.
[01:44:49.435 --> 01:44:51.616]  I've seen this happen so many times in DC.
[01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:55.318]  If you get a lot of enemies and you have more enemies and you have close friends
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:01.487]  Your days are numbered in this town, and that's the only thing I can see of bright light in the future that he's going to create.
[01:45:01.547 --> 01:45:04.411]  So many enemies are going to start cooperating with one another.
[01:45:04.651 --> 01:45:08.235]  They may not agree on a lot of things, but they'll agree that, look, we don't like this guy.
[01:45:08.256 --> 01:45:09.117]  He dissed me here.
[01:45:09.137 --> 01:45:10.719]  He dissed you here.
[01:45:10.759 --> 01:45:11.720]  Let's get rid of this guy.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:12.741]  And that may happen.
[01:45:14.423 --> 01:45:20.450]  Wayne Madsen, how do you see it playing out, though, as Obama administration betrays the public on what it claimed it would do?
[01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:22.032]  How do you see that playing out?
[01:45:22.352 --> 01:45:27.357]  How long will this honeymoon be, and what is Biden's big surprise that'll be so unpopular?
[01:45:28.078 --> 01:45:28.659]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:45:28.699 --> 01:45:34.906]  You know, we keep hearing about this guy Tom Friedman, this horrible guy that writes for the New York Times, was saying,
[01:45:35.256 --> 01:45:54.915]  You know, one more 9-11, you'll have to worry about, you know, you'll be taking more than your shoes off at the airport, and you know, people, you know, this fear thing, and you know, we keep hearing this from, over and over again, and you know, Obama wants to try to apparently curtail some of these powers, surveillance powers, saying, ah, what if there's another 9-11?
[01:45:56.161 --> 01:46:00.403]  You know, I hope he sticks to his guns, but with Emmanuel and some of the others, I'm not sure.
[01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:05.726]  This Napolitano at Homeland Security looks like, you know, she may be Tom Ridge with a dress on.
[01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:13.030]  I mean, it's just more, I think, in some respects, it's more of the same.
[01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:18.112]  I just noted that Napolitano today said she wants to strengthen the security on the U.S.-Canadian border.
[01:46:18.413 --> 01:46:19.813]  I didn't think that was a big problem.
[01:46:20.093 --> 01:46:22.895]  You know, do we have a lot of Canadians coming down here stealing our jobs?
[01:46:23.308 --> 01:46:26.790]  Well, it's already super tight for Americans going in and out.
[01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:27.951]  They only let the illegals through.
[01:46:27.971 --> 01:46:30.233]  It's terrible, yeah.
[01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:37.077]  Well, Wayne, I am going to let you go, but I just did want to get your final take on false flag terror.
[01:46:37.497 --> 01:46:41.420]  Ron Paul has said on this show, many others have said, we just had Gerald Cilente on last hour saying,
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:55.531]  They do think, not Obama himself, but the powers that be in the military industrial complex, the Rahm Emanuels, the Clintons, you know, those around them, that some staged provocations may be engaged in to get the people behind the wars continuing.
[01:46:56.492 --> 01:47:05.800]  Well, I think we have to be on guard against that, but I think the American people, most of them anyway, if it happens again, they're going to be a lot more skeptical and cynical than they were the first time.
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:09.703]  We were all kind of taken in the first time, but I think next time we're not going to be
[01:47:12.188 --> 01:47:12.749]  Absolutely.
[01:47:13.329 --> 01:47:14.590]  Wayne, give folks your website.
[01:47:15.311 --> 01:47:19.574]  Yes, it's www.WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:47:20.015 --> 01:47:21.175]  And we've got it up on screen.
[01:47:21.656 --> 01:47:27.060]  Wayne, W-A-Y-N-E, Madsen, M-A-D-S-E-N, report.com.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.761]  Wayne, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:29.642]  Thanks for the great reports.
[01:47:30.603 --> 01:47:30.983]  You bet.
[01:47:31.483 --> 01:47:32.164]  Alright, take care.
[01:47:32.184 --> 01:47:36.827]  I'm going to come back in the final segment and hit two or three articles I haven't hit, and we'll talk to Anthony Bruce.
[01:47:38.038 --> 01:47:38.538]  And Ryan.
[01:47:39.839 --> 01:47:43.402]  We'll cram and give each of you about a minute or so to ask a question or make a comment or two.
[01:47:45.263 --> 01:47:49.465]  Maybe not time to go to a call right now, but before I do that, I want to tell you who, again, has made this show possible.
[01:47:49.546 --> 01:47:52.087]  It is our sponsors, AcolaBlue.com.
[01:47:52.267 --> 01:47:54.209]  Fabulous atmospheric water generator.
[01:47:54.569 --> 01:47:55.990]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:47:56.050 --> 01:47:58.071]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.613]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[01:48:00.713 --> 01:48:02.154]  Ultimate water from the humidity in the air.
[01:48:02.794 --> 01:48:03.914]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[01:48:03.954 --> 01:48:06.435]  Machine bridges up to 28 liters or 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:48:06.736 --> 01:48:08.976]  Great tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:48:09.256 --> 01:48:10.657]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[01:48:10.817 --> 01:48:11.597]  Neutral pH.
[01:48:11.897 --> 01:48:17.219]  Goes through seven, I kept saying five, it's seven filters, including reverse osmosis and more inside.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.381]  Here's the number, 866-585-4044.
[01:48:22.401 --> 01:48:22.702]  866-585-4044.
[01:48:22.802 --> 01:48:26.923]  Or check out the big banners on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:48:27.183 --> 01:48:29.864]  If you forget the web address, remember, a cola blue.
[01:48:30.024 --> 01:48:31.165]  E-C-O-L-O, blue.com.
[01:48:32.325 --> 01:48:35.027]  All right, let's go ahead now and go to Anthony.
[01:48:35.107 --> 01:48:36.367]  Well, no, first time caller goes first.
[01:48:36.708 --> 01:48:38.088]  Bruce in Illinois, then Anthony.
[01:48:38.388 --> 01:48:40.350]  Bruce, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:48:40.610 --> 01:48:42.231]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:43.271]  Hi.
[01:48:43.391 --> 01:48:43.631]  Hi.
[01:48:43.871 --> 01:48:44.632]  Hey, quick question.
[01:48:46.133 --> 01:48:59.140]  In your opinion, what do you think the tipping point is going to be for the general masses, for the population to finally stand up and say, no, I'm not talking about armed violence or anything like that, but
[01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:02.392]  Stand up and say, no, this is enough.
[01:49:02.432 --> 01:49:07.656]  I mean, every day I hear, I mean, I listen to you every day and things are getting more and more outrageous.
[01:49:08.697 --> 01:49:12.761]  And I don't understand, I don't know where or when or what to watch.
[01:49:12.781 --> 01:49:14.162]  Well, look, look, look.
[01:49:14.242 --> 01:49:21.648]  Congress got a 9% approval rating before, I keep saying it's so important, before one party would be positive, high ratings, the other would be negative.
[01:49:21.908 --> 01:49:23.449]  People were getting fooled by the bait-and-switch.
[01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:25.891]  Still both parties have a low approval rating.
[01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:30.193]  Only Obama has this 65-70% depending on which poll you look at.
[01:49:30.233 --> 01:49:31.093]  It's already dropping.
[01:49:31.453 --> 01:49:33.514]  It went up to about 71, 72.
[01:49:34.535 --> 01:49:36.856]  It's already dropped down to about 63 in most of the polls.
[01:49:37.176 --> 01:49:39.317]  But it's not higher than 65 in any of the polls I've seen.
[01:49:39.757 --> 01:49:42.218]  It's already dropping one week in as people see the betrayal.
[01:49:42.838 --> 01:49:45.700]  And so they've kind of thrown this curveball of a black president.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.801]  People kind of go, whoa, maybe it is different.
[01:49:48.821 --> 01:49:50.182]  And then his rhetoric was different.
[01:49:51.132 --> 01:49:52.515]  So they're kind of waiting.
[01:49:52.775 --> 01:49:53.576]  They're hoping.
[01:49:53.596 --> 01:49:54.798]  I mean, who wants things to get bad?
[01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:56.361]  Who wants to think the depression is inevitable?
[01:49:56.622 --> 01:49:59.527]  Who wants to think they're putting troops on the streets is real, even when it's in the news?
[01:50:00.007 --> 01:50:03.353]  So they're kind of hoping and hoping and giving him a shot.
[01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:09.675]  I mean, it's like a woman who's being beaten by her husband every week, and then he promises over and over again, I promise I'm not going to do it, baby.
[01:50:09.735 --> 01:50:10.636]  I promise, I promise.
[01:50:11.036 --> 01:50:13.778]  And then he finally goes to a counselor, finally gets help, starts going to church.
[01:50:14.419 --> 01:50:17.401]  But then, a week after that, he goes ahead and breaks her nose again.
[01:50:17.761 --> 01:50:22.305]  It's kind of at a certain point, but see, this is like a wife with a husband who suddenly looks different.
[01:50:22.585 --> 01:50:23.666]  But it's still the same guy.
[01:50:24.967 --> 01:50:28.730]  So... Right, but it's like, when is that, when is the wife going to snap?
[01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:29.571]  That's the whole thing.
[01:50:30.291 --> 01:50:37.141]  I mean, you know, we wake up a million or a hundred million people in this country and
[01:50:38.174 --> 01:50:42.597]  You know, what, I mean, is it gonna go from, okay, we're all awake, we all understand, we all know what's going on?
[01:50:43.077 --> 01:50:48.621]  It's gonna go to rioting and shootings and people getting killed, and then that will help the globalists bring in more control.
[01:50:48.681 --> 01:50:56.947]  We have to somehow not let it get to that point, and just fully expose them, then take over our states, take over the federal government, and arrest all these criminals.
[01:50:57.447 --> 01:51:01.830]  The problem is, they're still gonna use NORTHCOM, then it's gonna get violent regardless, and we're gonna kick their butt.
[01:51:03.638 --> 01:51:07.019]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:51:07.159 --> 01:51:12.380]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:17.341]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:51:17.701 --> 01:51:28.824]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:51:29.224 --> 01:51:34.790]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:35.010 --> 01:51:41.076]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:41.276 --> 01:51:41.936]  What about you?
[01:51:42.317 --> 01:51:48.343]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:06.817]  A new world order.
[01:52:07.538 --> 01:52:11.958]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:12.418 --> 01:52:14.559]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:15.259 --> 01:52:17.479]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.440]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:21.215 --> 01:52:28.542]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:36.533]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:37.014 --> 01:52:40.496]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:40.876 --> 01:52:43.358]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:52:43.438 --> 01:52:44.599]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:44.619 --> 01:52:45.379]  They're not after money.
[01:52:45.399 --> 01:52:46.480]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.401]  They're after power.
[01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:48.521]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:52:57.527 --> 01:52:59.969]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:53:00.329 --> 01:53:01.410]  You have been warned.
[01:53:02.591 --> 01:53:04.132]  These are strange new days.
[01:53:04.472 --> 01:53:06.253]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[01:53:06.373 --> 01:53:07.794]  People are losing their jobs.
[01:53:08.074 --> 01:53:10.055]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[01:53:10.295 --> 01:53:14.778]  Food supplies are at an all-time low, and now we have a new untested president.
[01:53:14.998 --> 01:53:21.522]  The time of change is upon us, and to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[01:53:22.202 --> 01:53:24.704]  Self-preparedness is the key to survival.
[01:53:24.924 --> 01:53:26.405]  Internet Grocer understands your
[01:53:28.029 --> 01:53:28.369]  I think so.
[01:53:43.507 --> 01:53:43.727]  Call 903-356-6443.

[01:53:44.387 --> 01:53:44.548]  to 6 p.m.

[01:53:47.469 --> 01:53:48.930]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:11.222]  All right, I'm going to take a few final calls from Anthony and Ryan here in just a moment.
[01:54:27.745 --> 01:54:29.405]  But I meant to get to this today, I didn't.
[01:54:29.445 --> 01:54:33.387]  The Obama Deception, my new documentary film, it comes out March 15th.
[01:54:35.227 --> 01:54:40.449]  It's got like 28,000 views now, as of now, in about 36 hours, up on the web.
[01:54:40.469 --> 01:54:41.709]  I want that to even go more viral.
[01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:43.189]  Up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:43.349 --> 01:54:45.610]  Now I want to show them the YouTube page itself.
[01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:47.010]  Let's minimize that.
[01:54:49.311 --> 01:54:53.152]  You can go read the comments and see the left-right paradigm in motion here.
[01:54:53.272 --> 01:54:56.053]  You just heard an Obama supporter saying he's selling everybody out.
[01:54:57.048 --> 01:54:57.649]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:54:58.689 --> 01:54:59.290]  From D.C.
[01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:03.573]  I mean, anybody who actually knows the issues knows this is a bait and switch.
[01:55:04.514 --> 01:55:11.739]  But these are the type of comments, now they're the minority of the comments, and some of them even admit they know who I am, but still say things like this.
[01:55:11.819 --> 01:55:14.662]  This was JX Ford One.
[01:55:14.742 --> 01:55:19.966]  Why didn't this piece of bleeping producer, creator, take on Bush?
[01:55:20.026 --> 01:55:21.007]  Well, we did for eight years.
[01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:23.697]  110% made four films.
[01:55:24.377 --> 01:55:27.719]  This looks like a far right wing propaganda machine that will break down soon enough.
[01:55:27.999 --> 01:55:30.460]  People are tired of bull crap and need solutions.
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.541]  If you're not part of it, then you're a disrupter.
[01:55:32.942 --> 01:55:35.103]  Get ready for the new O generation.
[01:55:35.483 --> 01:55:40.766]  One of responsibility and servitude for the greater good.
[01:55:40.866 --> 01:55:43.167]  United States of America is the greatest country ever.
[01:55:44.605 --> 01:55:47.846]  Servitude isn't service, sir, but you got it right.
[01:55:48.046 --> 01:55:53.927]  Obama's service is really compulsory servitude and slavery and being bankrupted by the bankers.
[01:55:54.287 --> 01:55:58.088]  He's here to pacify you and fool you and bamboozle you as a front man.
[01:55:58.128 --> 01:55:58.968]  He doesn't run anything.
[01:55:58.988 --> 01:56:03.069]  If you really love Obama, you'd listen to me and understand he isn't going to do anything but rhetoric.
[01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:04.750]  They're going to have fake right-wingers attack him.
[01:56:05.050 --> 01:56:09.191]  That'll make the left defend him, just like when the left attacked Bush, the right mindlessly defended him.
[01:56:09.571 --> 01:56:10.531]  Stop being suckers.
[01:56:10.551 --> 01:56:10.991]  But look at this.
[01:56:12.438 --> 01:56:14.703]  People are tired of bull and need solutions.
[01:56:14.723 --> 01:56:16.347]  If you're not part of it, then you're a disruptor.
[01:56:16.628 --> 01:56:17.309]  That's what they're saying.
[01:56:17.329 --> 01:56:17.750]  I've been telling you.
[01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:21.659]  They're going to say, if you don't go along with him, you're causing everything to fall apart.
[01:56:24.406 --> 01:56:25.827]  So this is a comment from last night.
[01:56:25.867 --> 01:56:31.890]  There's like 800 comments or something on there, but you can go down to the comments and read his.
[01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:33.851]  The United States of America is the greatest country ever.
[01:56:33.912 --> 01:56:35.312]  The country of servitude.
[01:56:36.173 --> 01:56:37.894]  Service is something I choose to do.
[01:56:38.534 --> 01:56:40.015]  Servitude is being a slave.
[01:56:40.775 --> 01:56:42.817]  I mean, you said it yourself because you're so ignorant.
[01:56:43.017 --> 01:56:44.718]  You called yourself a slave and don't even know it.
[01:56:46.339 --> 01:56:49.921]  One of responsibility and servitude for the greater good.
[01:56:50.891 --> 01:56:51.491]  Zoom in on this.
[01:56:51.551 --> 01:56:52.092]  Zoom way in.
[01:56:52.112 --> 01:56:55.414]  I want people to actually see this guy's comment printed off of YouTube.
[01:56:55.434 --> 01:56:57.955]  You can go to the website and watch it for yourself.
[01:57:00.096 --> 01:57:02.238]  Zoom in on this one right here.
[01:57:02.258 --> 01:57:07.981]  In fact, I'm just going to underline servitude right here.
[01:57:09.182 --> 01:57:10.743]  Servitude for the greater good.
[01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:11.703]  You mean for the bankers?
[01:57:13.744 --> 01:57:14.565]  Servitude.
[01:57:15.665 --> 01:57:18.027]  And see, I'm a disrupter because I don't want to be in servitude.
[01:57:19.007 --> 01:57:19.608]  What an idiot.
[01:57:20.523 --> 01:57:22.705]  Alright, let's jam in one call here, that's all I'm going to have time for.
[01:57:22.866 --> 01:57:24.768]  Anthony in Georgia, you're on the air, take us out of here.
[01:57:25.929 --> 01:57:31.736]  Hey Alex, about the Obama agenda, thanks for all your work by the way, but one word, Africa.
[01:57:32.176 --> 01:57:32.517]  U.S.
[01:57:32.677 --> 01:57:33.438]  African Command.
[01:57:33.738 --> 01:57:38.924]  And I don't know if you got into the new movie or not, but Tiffany McKinney talked about it in her running election.
[01:57:39.782 --> 01:57:47.586]  And what they're trying to do, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the former and current, on February 6th of 2007... They're going to send a bunch of U.S.
[01:57:47.626 --> 01:57:50.367]  troops to Africa, and they need a black president as the front.
[01:57:50.968 --> 01:57:51.528]  Exactly.
[01:57:51.568 --> 01:57:57.751]  He's a vampire, like in the old tale, you've got to open the door up for the vampire, and they're knocking on Africa's door, the U.S.
[01:57:57.811 --> 01:57:59.712]  empire, and Africa's going to open it.
[01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:09.137]  They're going to look at the people, see their pretty brown smile, they're going to open the doors, and the American empire is going to go in and steal all the natural resources, their gold, their diamonds, suck them dry of all their blood.
[01:58:09.767 --> 01:58:10.807]  So that's after his role.
[01:58:10.907 --> 01:58:12.128]  I mean, that's Obama's role.
[01:58:12.188 --> 01:58:13.368]  I think that's why he's president.
[01:58:13.428 --> 01:58:15.888]  Man, powerful, powerful analogy.
[01:58:15.928 --> 01:58:18.769]  I'd like to put you in my Obama film saying just that.
[01:58:18.869 --> 01:58:21.369]  Call me back tomorrow when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:24.390]  Say that again, because it had music over it so we can't use it.
[01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:30.711]  And I want to put your comment in the film, because I'm going to have a lot of men on the street and that could be that.
[01:58:30.731 --> 01:58:31.692]  OK, will you call me back tomorrow?
[01:58:32.392 --> 01:58:33.032]  Sure, no problem.
[01:58:33.552 --> 01:58:34.172]  Fantastic.
[01:58:34.212 --> 01:58:34.792]  Get in tomorrow.
[01:58:34.812 --> 01:58:35.892]  In fact, John, get his number.
[01:58:35.932 --> 01:58:38.313]  Let's have him on tomorrow for five minutes so he can say that.
