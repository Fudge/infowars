[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.090]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.342]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:29.848]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:36.609]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.830]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.392]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:52.419]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.331]  It's not about left or right.
[00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:56.112]  It's about a one world government.
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:02.918]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:14.507]  The people strike back.
[00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:21.502]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:30.072]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:33.635]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:36.819]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.261]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:55.636]  Big Brother.
[00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:23.735]  Mainstream media.
[00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:25.556]  Government cover-ups.
[00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:27.036]  You want answers?
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:29.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:32.999]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.602]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:53.460]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live now, eight minutes into this second hour.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.102]  He joins us once a month.
[00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:56.764]  He runs the website whatreallyhappened.com.
[00:02:56.804 --> 00:03:01.670]  His name is Mike Rivero, joining us from Hawaii to get his perspective on things that are happening.
[00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:06.256]  Now, in the last hour of ranting and raving, I didn't even get into this report.
[00:03:07.282 --> 00:03:27.059]  Last Thursday, Kurt Nemo wrote a story about an illegal checkpoint that was mentioned in the news, where they were going to have a regular army, and this was statewide by the way, we've now discovered, running checkpoints, searching people's cars, just randomly on the highway, and then local news has now reported, they went ahead and did it.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.860]  In one town!
[00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:50.156]  uh... with that we learned that we wrote a story about regular army to run a checkpoint our listeners because of WBCR and uh... a few other affiliates we have in Tennessee great folks out there they called the governor and the governor canceled and we had state representative uh... on the show Johnny Shaw from District 80 yesterday
[00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.712]  Talking about how it was upsetting people.
[00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:58.375]  Then we learned that they went ahead and did the drill with Air Force MPs, you name it, and other cities and towns.
[00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:07.480]  And the Marion County News reported that the traffic was backed up for a mile as the U.S.
[00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:14.964]  Air Force troops, Homeland Security, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, National Guard,
[00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:16.845]  Local police.
[00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:18.666]  It goes on and on.
[00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:20.027]  Tennessee Department of Transportation.
[00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:21.148]  Tennessee Department of Revenue.
[00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:23.269]  And they didn't find any terrorists.
[00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.129]  They said they were looking for 24-style terrorists.
[00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.813]  But they did write some DWIs and write tickets for dust on the bumper of a truck, an 18-wheeler.
[00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:33.013]  So they did raise a bunch of money.
[00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:38.356]  Just swarms of every agency and they're feeding at the trough as the country collapses.
[00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:40.097]  And so I wanted to
[00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:56.280]  I wanted to first, we're going to play that clip coming up, but I first want to talk to Mike Rivero about that because, you know, we've had the mainstream media, Mike, attacking us, saying that there's no plan to put troops on the streets as it's in the Army Times and the Washington Post.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.501]  They say, oh, that's a conspiracy, Glenn Beck says.
[00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:00.603]  There's no plan to put troops on the streets.
[00:05:00.983 --> 00:05:03.665]  But then meanwhile, they're just doing it everywhere.
[00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.887]  Yeah, we're seeing this all over the country and it's a big problem.
[00:05:08.947 --> 00:05:09.888]  It's incrementalism.
[00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:17.019]  They're trying slowly but surely to get ordinary American citizens used to the idea of military people in the streets at all times.
[00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.602]  And yet, it is a violation of posse comitatus.
[00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:24.989]  And it's like the old saying about once the camel gets that nose under the edge of the tent, the camel is coming in.
[00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.590]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.177]  They're trying to get everybody used to the idea of literally an America under US military occupation.
[00:05:32.497 --> 00:05:34.359]  Exactly the same thing they're doing in Iraq.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.722]  Exactly the same thing they're doing in Afghanistan.
[00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:38.324]  Exactly the same thing they're trying to...
[00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:40.105]  To do in Iran.
[00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:47.907]  And if you think about it, checkpoints with armed military people and traffic jams a mile back, that's the kind of things we see being done in Gaza all the time.
[00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:55.370]  And Americans should be very concerned and very angry about this because we're all being treated like criminals.
[00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.030]  Why?
[00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.391]  We're not the criminals here.
[00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.792]  We are not criminals and we should refuse to be treated like criminals.
[00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:02.933]  The whole point of the Bill of Rights
[00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:09.744]  Is that the government is not allowed to treat law-abiding citizens as anything other than law-abiding citizens.
[00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:15.213]  They're not allowed to come into our homes and our cars just to look around at random on the off chance they might see something.
[00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:20.660]  Well, I mean, this is classical tyranny to have troops on the streets searching, even in the middle of the country.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.563]  You know, they claimed 9-11 was about Al-Qaeda and it was just for them losing their rights, whoever Al-Qaeda was, Al-Cieda.
[00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:40.589]  Now, they're coming out and saying, oh no, it's Americans, the Army's here to fight crime, and you don't get due process, and we're preparing to engage you and take over the states.
[00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:45.292]  And meanwhile, they've got the military and all the public schools now recruiting by federal law.
[00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:50.176]  They're converting hundreds and hundreds of public schools to military academies.
[00:06:50.516 --> 00:06:55.321]  They've got the BATF in, the 7th and 8th grade, with semester courses.
[00:06:56.202 --> 00:06:58.004]  What's in mommy and daddy's medicine cabinet?
[00:06:58.024 --> 00:07:02.569]  I mean, I have local news ads the police run saying, tattle on your parents, we give you 200 bucks.
[00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:04.390]  I mean, this is Stasi!
[00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:14.554]  And then suddenly, oh, the Army's here, the Air Force is here, oh, there's Fiesta in San Antonio, we're going to have MPs out from the Army base and the Air Force base searching you.
[00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:26.818]  And they're just doing it, doing it, doing it, doing it, doing it, clearly because the bankers are looting and robbing and stealing everything, and they're afraid of us ever getting control of our government again, legally and lawfully, and bringing them to justice.
[00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.831]  That's exactly right.
[00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.714]  What this is about is political repression.
[00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:39.803]  They know that they have lost the ability to lie to the American people and get away with it, so now it's just deteriorating into absolute thuggism.
[00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:44.748]  When capitalism fails, it becomes fascist, and that's exactly where we are right now.
[00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.450]  They're trying to loot the country.
[00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.751]  It's not going to go on much longer.
[00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:49.533]  I don't think they can hold it together much longer.
[00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:56.435]  But while they're continuing to loot the country, they're going to have the armed guards making sure that we don't stand up and say, look, that's our money.
[00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:57.976]  Please take your hands off of it.
[00:07:58.016 --> 00:07:59.897]  In fact, give it back to us.
[00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:06.479]  And they're looking at what's happening in Europe and places like Iceland and Czechoslovakia or the Czech Republic, rather.
[00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:12.101]  They're obviously very concerned that we're going to start seeing mass riots here as the economy continues to deteriorate.
[00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:21.092]  And we, the American people, are going to start saying it is time to get rid of this corrupt government and get something better that works for the people in its place.
[00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:22.353]  It already happened in Iceland.
[00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:24.156]  It's happening in other countries around the world.
[00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:28.341]  This is a global revolt, or a global reboot, if you will.
[00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:40.687]  Where everybody is saying this style of capitalism, this style of banking is great for the rich, it is terrible for ordinary people, and it is time to change the system again to something that works for us.
[00:08:41.347 --> 00:08:42.868]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:49.251]  And they're going to stand there with their guns, guarding their treasure houses, and just grab on to as much as they can before they get kicked out.
[00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:51.136]  Exactly.
[00:08:51.216 --> 00:08:54.658]  Bloomberg Financial, every few months new numbers come out.
[00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:56.159]  We always sit with horror waiting.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.882]  Two weeks after the bailout it was $2.2 trillion.
[00:08:58.902 --> 00:09:01.644]  A couple months later it was $5.5 trillion.
[00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:02.685]  Then it was $8.7 trillion.
[00:09:02.705 --> 00:09:03.866]  Then $9.8 trillion.
[00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:06.347]  And then now the newest numbers come out.
[00:09:07.768 --> 00:09:14.270]  12 trillion 800 billion just shy of the entire GDP in six months.
[00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.231]  I mean, this makes Weimar Republic stuff look tame.
[00:09:18.531 --> 00:09:20.211]  This makes Zimbabwe look tame.
[00:09:20.271 --> 00:09:24.172]  I mean, folks, for those who don't know, they've never had spending anywhere near this.
[00:09:24.852 --> 00:09:25.712]  This, this, this.
[00:09:25.892 --> 00:09:30.273]  And they're claiming we owe all this in tax money that was given to offshore banks.
[00:09:30.954 --> 00:09:33.774]  And then meanwhile, they've got army checkpoints popping up everywhere.
[00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:36.395]  I mean, this is highway robbery.
[00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:59.409]  It's worse than that it's slavery because when they hand a bill to every American for forty fifty thousand dollars and then have armed guards pointed at you to make sure that you're going to pay it off with you know you don't have a choice in anymore that really is slavery and one of the things we say around our website all the time is there is no freedom without the freedom to say no we're always being told we're so free the terrorists hate us
[00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:03.470]  If we can't say no, then we are not free.
[00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.350]  We are slaves.
[00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:16.635]  Six months ago, when TARP was first being ramrodded through the Congress, 90% of all phone calls to the Congress from Americans said, no, no way, do not use our money to fix a broken corporation.
[00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:22.297]  Congress did it anyway, even right before an election, which shows you how much force was being brought to bear.
[00:10:22.597 --> 00:10:25.218]  As you keep saying, the numbers keep going up and going up and going up.
[00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:30.201]  All Americans, working class and middle class Americans are saying, please don't do this.
[00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:36.565]  You are selling our future to the bankers and financial institutions, to the Bernie Madoffs of the world.
[00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:38.867]  They just nailed another one of his feeders for fraud.
[00:10:39.127 --> 00:10:49.074]  They're all crooks and our government is working hand in hand with them to loot the populace and just give it to the people who've already got so much money they can't remember how many homes they own.
[00:10:49.474 --> 00:10:52.996]  And we, the people, seem at this point unable to say no.
[00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:54.798]  And that means we are slaves.
[00:10:55.888 --> 00:11:00.449]  Yeah, it's what, in the Times of London, with the former head of GMAC.
[00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:10.712]  In fact, guys, Google Bernard Madoff and hit news, because I thought I printed it this morning and I don't have it, feeding billions into Madoff.
[00:11:12.353 --> 00:11:15.093]  So they've got all sorts of scams going on.
[00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:23.936]  They're now saying that Alan Stanford, with the $10 billion stolen, Sir Alan Stanford, by the Queen, was involved in money laundering for cocaine dealers.
[00:11:23.956 --> 00:11:24.616]  Well, of course!
[00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:26.517]  I mean, who do you think these people are?
[00:11:26.537 --> 00:11:41.552]  Yeah, it's out of control and the more we dig, we're starting to see it is just this incredible interconnected network of fraudsters and scamsters and right now there's a huge, huge rush.
[00:11:41.612 --> 00:11:48.139]  I think one of the reasons why Barack Obama is trying so hard to get a new war going in Iran or North Korea or
[00:11:48.699 --> 00:12:02.903]  It almost doesn't really matter, is as more and more of this financial corruption comes to light, especially here at tax time, where so many Americans are just angry over the whole tax system, we're starting to ask those questions we should have been asking all along.
[00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.224]  Is this really a legitimate government?
[00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:06.965]  Should I go on supporting it?
[00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:11.546]  And more and more people are saying, no, it's just a bunch of crooks that are serving their own interests.
[00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:15.027]  They're selling our future to the bankers, to the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:17.128]  Why should I go on supporting that?
[00:12:17.468 --> 00:12:23.993]  And I think we're getting near to the sort of flashpoint we saw in Romania some years back, where it's just all going to explode.
[00:12:24.593 --> 00:12:30.317]  Barack wants a war that he can blame all of these problems on, and if he doesn't get it, I think the writing is on the wall.
[00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:33.479]  The American people are reaching the point where they're going to stand up and say, no.
[00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:34.880]  We have a right to say no.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.281]  We are saying no.
[00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.083]  And that's what the Rand Corporation said six months ago.
[00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:48.749]  They said, we need a war bigger than Iraq, a World War III, so the public will rally around the government through false patriotism, so we can continue the looting.
[00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:57.195]  And so they're now, Israel's saying, we may go ahead and strike Iran, we're going to go ahead and attack them, and then all hell's going to break loose with that, or they may just invade
[00:12:58.274 --> 00:13:00.236]  Pakistan, I'm just watching the news this morning.
[00:13:00.597 --> 00:13:04.421]  They're going, Taliban's getting ready to hit the White House, Taliban's getting ready to strike America.
[00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:10.408]  You can see them stage the terror attack, claim Pakistan did it, and we're off to the races there with the nuclear power.
[00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:18.838]  And then, oh, well, yeah, the banks are looting me of trillions a month, but I guess it's okay because I'm fighting brown people in a country I can't find.
[00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:27.149]  Well, I think where the RAND Corporation has missed it, in fact, so many of these old Cold War fossils continue to make this mistake.
[00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:38.072]  They don't understand how the alternative media, how websites like Prison Planet and InfoWars and WhatReallyHappened have changed the fundamental nature of the way information flows through our society.
[00:13:38.392 --> 00:13:49.856]  They may start a war assuming the American people are going to rally around the flag out of false patriotism, but that's not going to work if the American people already know that is the only reason for the war to exist.
[00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:53.832]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:13:53.952 --> 00:13:59.177]  I want to walk through how you see this unfolding.
[00:13:59.257 --> 00:14:02.019]  This is the most critical time in history we're entering right now.
[00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:04.962]  We've been in it for about a year, but it just gets more and more intense.
[00:14:05.883 --> 00:14:08.405]  And our voices are more important than ever right now.
[00:14:08.445 --> 00:14:10.167]  That means your voices are more important than ever.
[00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:14.771]  And we have Mother Jones admitting Obama's getting ready to try to shut down the Internet.
[00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:18.778]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:14:18.898 --> 00:14:25.621]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:34.045]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:39.988]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:41.970]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.172]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:14:44.192 --> 00:14:48.555]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:50.837]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:14:50.937 --> 00:14:58.404]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:00.820]  We're good.
[00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:22.557]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:30.804]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:15:31.144 --> 00:15:39.011]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:44.075]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:49.099]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:53.482]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:15:53.962 --> 00:15:54.983]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:15:55.043 --> 00:15:59.126]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:15:59.547 --> 00:16:03.930]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.012]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:16:07.452 --> 00:16:09.094]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:16:12.276 --> 00:16:12.816]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:16:13.096 --> 00:16:21.641]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:27.704]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:16:28.245 --> 00:16:34.388]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:16:34.728 --> 00:16:36.549]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:39.091]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:50.117]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:16:52.358 --> 00:16:53.639]  It's not about left or right.
[00:16:54.019 --> 00:16:55.420]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.124]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:12.196]  The Obama Deception.
[00:17:12.617 --> 00:17:13.818]  The people strike back!
[00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:22.317]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:28.419]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:34.120]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.681]  Starve or surrender.
[00:17:37.001 --> 00:17:40.842]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:17:41.322 --> 00:17:42.223]  What then?
[00:17:44.924 --> 00:17:47.765]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:52.187]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:17:52.347 --> 00:17:55.149]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:17:55.209 --> 00:18:02.252]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:18:02.452 --> 00:18:04.212]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.

[00:18:38.098 --> 00:18:42.313]  Alright, fellow GCN Radio talk show host, Mike Rivero joins us right now.
[00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:54.945]  Coming up, I'm going to play a little clip of Lou Dobbs with the Mexican President Calderon saying, U.S.
[00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:57.126]  officials are helping deal the drugs in the U.S.
[00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:58.787]  And Lou Dobbs says, I can't disagree with you.
[00:18:58.827 --> 00:19:00.047]  I've studied this and I agree.
[00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:06.951]  Of course, the CIA Selector General admitted in 96 congressional hearings that the government's shipping in the majority of the narcotics.
[00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:10.192]  So just the phony drug war is falling apart.
[00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:13.934]  Everything's starting to implode inside this system.
[00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:21.439]  Mike Rivero, specifically on the internet front, cyber security bill gives Obama dictatorial power over the internet.
[00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:27.581]  Even Mother Jones admits with the headline, should Obama control the internet, that this is a takeover.
[00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:36.764]  They're taking over the infrastructure, the very hubs of the companies, so that the government literally can shut it down or tap it without warrants, and that's admitted.
[00:19:37.184 --> 00:19:40.405]  And as you know, three weeks ago, the head of cyber security, Romeland Security, over
[00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:49.091]  Quit saying this is a threat to our free country, our threat to democracy, and our republic, in his words, by doing this.
[00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:52.173]  So there's your inside whistleblower, that this is a total takeover.
[00:19:52.193 --> 00:19:55.715]  You've got the New York Times coming out saying, we need to gatekeep the internet.
[00:19:55.975 --> 00:19:59.298]  We need to control free speech, because the mainstream media can't compete with us.
[00:20:00.307 --> 00:20:01.528]  No, they absolutely cannot.
[00:20:01.628 --> 00:20:03.510]  Mostly because we've caught the mainstream.
[00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.714]  Well, actually, I call them the corporate media because the mainstream is shifting to us.
[00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:13.560]  The alternative media, the blogosphere, we're already outpacing traditional paper newspapers.
[00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:18.465]  We're neck and neck with the large radio networks like Clear Channel.
[00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:19.806]  We're catching up on TV.
[00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:24.231]  And the bottom line is this is a threat to the monopoly of information by the government.
[00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:25.712]  And by the corporate media.
[00:20:25.912 --> 00:20:27.193]  They can't lie to us anymore.
[00:20:27.513 --> 00:20:29.795]  And if they can't lie to us, they can't control us.
[00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:38.080]  And unfortunately, our government is carrying so many lies forward, accumulated over the last 200 years, they can't start telling the truth now.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.022]  Or they're going to face some very embarrassing questions.
[00:20:41.442 --> 00:20:46.746]  And so they're kind of trapped by the fossilization of their mendacity, if you want a phrase for that.
[00:20:47.186 --> 00:20:51.869]  And so, yeah, they see the internet as a threat, and they're trying to find ways to control it.
[00:20:51.889 --> 00:20:54.291]  They plant all kinds of public relations people on there.
[00:20:54.871 --> 00:20:58.195]  Uh, to try and shout down dissenting points of view.
[00:20:58.495 --> 00:21:03.901]  They certainly monitor all of our websites and watch out for what we're saying and keep tabs on that.
[00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:17.535]  They fund and set up their own competing websites to try, as your song for the bumper was saying, to try and keep us squabbling amongst ourselves instead of uniting and realizing that the biggest problem with the United States is the United States government.
[00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:20.916]  And so yeah, they're going to try and control, they're going to try and shut it down.
[00:21:21.036 --> 00:21:30.801]  I don't think they can succeed any more than the people who wanted to shut down Gutenberg's movable type printing and inexpensive books were able to succeed with that.
[00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:40.346]  We already know that there is a networking system out there called Fidonet that operates without the big corporate fiber companies.
[00:21:41.086 --> 00:21:43.227]  It's a little slower than the traditional internet.
[00:21:43.687 --> 00:21:51.853]  But it does work, and it can operate without being subject to government censorship or control, because there is no physical infrastructure.
[00:21:52.213 --> 00:21:53.955]  It's all telephone to telephone to telephone.
[00:21:53.995 --> 00:22:00.840]  And remember, in the former Soviet Union, that corrupt government was brought down by a network of fax machines.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.063]  That's all the Russian people had to spread the truth with, and that's what they used.
[00:22:05.183 --> 00:22:08.065]  People want the truth, they're going to go where the truth is to be found,
[00:22:08.505 --> 00:22:18.213]  If they find some way to shut down and turn the internet into just a glorified new TV network, the people who want the truth are going to find a way to get to it.
[00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:24.799]  There will always be a new alternative means of mass communication because now we know it is possible to accomplish.
[00:22:25.916 --> 00:22:26.516]  Exactly.
[00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:38.582]  As they tax the web, shut it down, we make it a few thousand channels, as China's already done, as Australia's announced, you know, Chinese-style net censorship for Australia, and they say that's good.
[00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:45.685]  They're now trying it with ending net neutrality, Internet2, all of these systems, and now having the federal government
[00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:52.473]  Make companies bring in federal hubs to literally snoop and watch everything with no warrants.
[00:22:52.813 --> 00:22:56.197]  I mean, Obama said he was gonna, you know, end Bush's warrantless wiretapping.
[00:22:56.478 --> 00:22:59.942]  He's going further than Bush did.
[00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:01.731]  Yes, he absolutely is.
[00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:12.495]  There was a story we ran earlier today basically saying that Obama is expanding Bush's legal justification for warrantless snooping on all of our communications.
[00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:14.795]  And folks, here's the bottom line.
[00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:22.678]  Under this guise that our government is trying to find and deal with terrorists, they are treating us like we are the criminals.
[00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:30.682]  Every time we go through an airport, every time we send an email, every time we make a phone call, we are being treated as if we are the prisoners.
[00:23:31.482 --> 00:23:33.063]  They are so terrified of us.
[00:23:33.363 --> 00:23:37.045]  They're trying to find some way they can stop us from communicating with each other.
[00:23:37.345 --> 00:23:39.146]  That's the reason for the police roadblocks.
[00:23:39.446 --> 00:23:42.688]  Keep us so scared we won't talk to each other.
[00:23:42.728 --> 00:23:43.468]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:44.328]  Repeat that when we come back.
[00:23:44.368 --> 00:23:44.829]  That's key.
[00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:47.740]  Oh, why's the Army at the checkpoint?
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.060]  Oh, just the Army's here now, hi!
[00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:51.581]  Oh, by the way, we've trained your kids to tattle on you.
[00:23:51.982 --> 00:23:53.742]  And by the way, we're demonizing the Second Amendment.
[00:23:53.762 --> 00:23:55.103]  And by the way, we work for the bankers.
[00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:55.543]  Ha ha!
[00:23:56.023 --> 00:23:57.384]  I mean, come on, police and military.
[00:23:57.424 --> 00:23:58.905]  You really want to be in this position?
[00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:00.505]  On the wrong side of history?
[00:24:01.046 --> 00:24:01.866]  Stay there, Mike Rivera.
[00:24:01.886 --> 00:24:04.127]  We'll be right back with a lot of other key news on the other side.
[00:24:06.848 --> 00:24:07.728]  We're on the march.
[00:24:08.229 --> 00:24:09.829]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.823 --> 00:24:18.004]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:24:18.184 --> 00:24:20.445]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:24.587]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:24:24.747 --> 00:24:28.430]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:36.974]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:24:37.074 --> 00:24:40.716]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:45.159]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing
[00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:53.922]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:25:20.134 --> 00:25:22.258]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:25:22.739 --> 00:25:29.771]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:36.503]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:25:36.904 --> 00:25:38.745]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:25:38.885 --> 00:25:41.307]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:25:41.387 --> 00:25:52.314]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:25:52.955 --> 00:25:54.256]  It's not about left or right.
[00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:56.017]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:25:56.477 --> 00:26:02.802]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:36.756]  I had a copy here somewhere.
[00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:37.818]  I was going to show folks on TV.
[00:27:37.838 --> 00:27:38.679]  It doesn't matter.
[00:27:41.263 --> 00:27:58.787]  The point is, is that this film shows you who runs the planet, what the bankers are doing, how they want a world government to take their Ponzi scheme scam, buy up the planet, then set up a giant global carbon tax to regulate and control every facet of our lives.
[00:27:58.807 --> 00:28:04.308]  I mean, this is the only issue is what these bankers are doing and what's taking place with them.
[00:28:06.465 --> 00:28:07.525]  That's the big issue!
[00:28:07.946 --> 00:28:20.370]  Not Britney Spears and her new iPod, or Obama giving the Queen an iPod, or, you know, what Obama's, the First Lady's wearing today.
[00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:27.633]  The bankers have stolen the entire GDP of the nation in six months.
[00:28:29.573 --> 00:28:31.494]  As much as the country produces in a year!
[00:28:33.348 --> 00:28:37.371]  They've stolen in half a year, and they're only intensifying the stealing.
[00:28:37.871 --> 00:28:39.892]  And they're going to try to squeeze it out of you.
[00:28:42.094 --> 00:28:48.878]  And they've got about a third of the population, because remember, he only got a little bit more than half of the voters, and that was 60%.
[00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:53.581]  So he's got about a third of the population believing anything he says, anything he does.
[00:28:54.761 --> 00:29:02.667]  We gotta reach out to those folks fast, because that's the cannon fodder, the forced volunteers that we cover in this film, that he's going to use.
[00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:09.553]  This has the National Compulsory Service, it has the FEMA camps, all documented in the Obama deception.
[00:29:09.993 --> 00:29:14.377]  Available at Infowars.com or call toll free to get it, 888-253-3139.
[00:29:15.178 --> 00:29:16.999]  This film needs to be seen by everyone.
[00:29:17.539 --> 00:29:18.961]  Okay, going back to Mike Rivera.
[00:29:20.382 --> 00:29:23.724]  Mike, getting into Madoff, I mean I keep harping on this because
[00:29:24.864 --> 00:29:35.310]  What the banks have done with this Ponzi scheme, with this counterfeit money, which even Bill Moyers is having guests on, you know, saying it's a fraud, it's a takeover, it's a bank robbery.
[00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.851]  Mainstream News is now admitting that.
[00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:44.676]  We have to, instead of just going through this endless political pop system where they keep replacing it with the two parties that they own,
[00:29:46.089 --> 00:30:06.317]  Don't we need to go for their indictment by grand juries and then investigations and go up the chain from Madoff and others that are involved in all of this corruption right up to the top and then go ahead and just arrest the new world bankers instead of having them take over the planet and feed the entire economy into their coffers?
[00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:16.798]  Well, that would be the ideal, obviously, but we're already seeing a tremendous amount of reluctance to investigate, let alone prosecute Madoff and his circle of particulars.
[00:30:17.098 --> 00:30:20.260]  And to give you an example, I mean, look at the AIPAC spy trial.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.641]  I mean, how many years that has been delayed and that has been delayed.
[00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:26.882]  There are some secrets at the core of the U.S.
[00:30:26.942 --> 00:30:29.623]  government that, if they were exposed,
[00:30:30.083 --> 00:30:30.964]  We're good to go.
[00:30:51.876 --> 00:30:53.717]  And we're not going to see legal action.
[00:30:53.737 --> 00:30:57.099]  We're not going to see, you know, there'll be a call for a special prosecutor.
[00:30:57.399 --> 00:31:02.743]  There'll be a call for a new investigation, which will go absolutely no place.
[00:31:03.103 --> 00:31:14.950]  And we're already seeing where they're talking about they don't want to do the clawbacks on Bernie Madoff's pyramid scheme because they don't know, they don't want to expose who made the money off of that.
[00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.311]  We're talking about $65 billion in losses.
[00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:22.952]  What they're not talking about is all the people who made money and where that money went.
[00:31:23.252 --> 00:31:35.916]  We know that some of that money went to certain pro-Israel foundations and organizations, which then funneled that money through AIPAC to the campaign war chest of congressmen who are pro-Israel.
[00:31:36.296 --> 00:31:42.738]  So Bernie Madoff, at the very least, is known to be part of the funding mechanism by which AIPAC bought the U.S.
[00:31:42.798 --> 00:31:44.359]  Congress away from the American people.
[00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:51.441]  So, I don't think we're going to be able to see much luck in going after indictments and grand juries.
[00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:55.003]  I mean, you know, we're letting the people who committed torture walk free.
[00:31:55.103 --> 00:31:57.964]  Spain is going to indict and try them in absentia.
[00:31:58.564 --> 00:32:02.005]  But our own governmental system is protecting its own.
[00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:09.387]  And that is why, ultimately, I think the ultimate outcome of our current historical period is we're going to see the U.S.
[00:32:09.447 --> 00:32:11.608]  government collapse the way the old U.S.S.R.
[00:32:11.648 --> 00:32:11.868]  did.
[00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:13.709]  Sooner would be better than later.
[00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:19.992]  And the players are just going to line their own pockets as much as they can between now and when they have to head for the border.
[00:32:21.092 --> 00:32:26.295]  Well, we're already seeing a lot of elites in the last five years leave the United States and they're leaving Israel.
[00:32:26.315 --> 00:32:27.335]  They're even leaving England.
[00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:31.197]  They're moving to the Cook Islands, Australia, New Zealand, Paraguay.
[00:32:31.757 --> 00:32:35.479]  So we see the elite actually exiting Western nations.
[00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:44.967]  Yeah, I think they understand the writing is on the wall and as we keep saying the last official act of any government is to loot the nation and that seems to be going on right now.
[00:32:45.867 --> 00:32:53.272]  Certainly my opinion of Barack Obama is that he does not appear to be doing anything at all consistent with the idea that the U.S.
[00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:55.194]  economy can be saved in the long term.
[00:32:55.654 --> 00:33:02.199]  Everything right now is just grab the money and give it to this favorite crony and grab more money and give it to that favorite supporter and
[00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:07.522]  He's not doing any of the things that would be consistent with restarting the U.S.
[00:33:07.562 --> 00:33:08.963]  economy and getting it running again.
[00:33:09.343 --> 00:33:12.265]  Mike, to be specific, you were a Barack Obama supporter.
[00:33:13.686 --> 00:33:15.487]  Now he's been in office a couple months.
[00:33:15.787 --> 00:33:17.008]  What's your take on him now?
[00:33:17.668 --> 00:33:23.712]  Well, the honeymoon is definitely over and the condom wrappers are on the floor and we got, you know.
[00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:29.999]  I was favoring Barack Obama marginally over John McCain.
[00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:38.048]  I really wanted Ron Paul, as so many Americans did, but when it became obvious that Ron Paul was simply not going to be allowed to get near the convention floors,
[00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:46.074]  And we came down to that awful choice of the lesser of two evils, and I still don't know that John McCain would have been any better at this.
[00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:54.341]  It does seem that they're both owned by the same interests, and really the difference between Republican and Democrat appears to be almost purely cosmetic.
[00:33:55.061 --> 00:34:23.076]  uh... and it's almost irrelevant who's in the white house right now they're all pushing this same agenda this globalism uh... this one world government and i gotta tell you every time i hear global governance or new world order or one world government i keep thinking you know that's what alexander the great wanted that's what napoleon wanted that's what rome tried to do that's what hitler tried to do this idea of a single global government is nothing but the vanity of the rich and powerful run amok and it never
[00:34:23.616 --> 00:34:26.457]  Never works out well for the ordinary people of the planet Earth.
[00:34:27.497 --> 00:34:36.200]  Well, I mean, that's the issue is that Barack Obama, in a way, is worse than McCain because McCain was a dead horse.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.020]  You know, he was angry.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.161]  He was not that smart.
[00:34:40.681 --> 00:34:41.681]  He was discredited.
[00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:44.982]  He was associated with Bush, the last phase of the New World Order.
[00:34:45.422 --> 00:34:48.723]  But with Obama, it's a fresh horse in the race, or a fresh boxer.
[00:34:49.143 --> 00:34:56.666]  They put him in, and the public has kind of fooled just long enough for him to sucker punch us, you know, with the New World Order.
[00:34:56.686 --> 00:35:03.909]  And now he's betrayed everything he said he'd do, and the lobbyists, and the wars, and warrantless wiretapping, and no rights for detainees.
[00:35:04.049 --> 00:35:06.210]  I mean, the looting, $12.8 trillion.
[00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.271]  I mean, this guy's got it in high gear.
[00:35:09.271 --> 00:35:17.980]  And the Obama zombies have invested themselves in him, and most of them, you know, didn't just vote for Obama to repudiate Bush like you did.
[00:35:18.421 --> 00:35:21.424]  They voted for him because they fully bought into it.
[00:35:21.464 --> 00:35:26.469]  So see, that's why I was saying Obama was worse, was because he could sucker the people better.
[00:35:27.702 --> 00:35:30.043]  Well, I don't know that he's suckering them all that well.
[00:35:30.103 --> 00:35:35.106]  And again, this gets back to the idea of the alternative media being the venue of truth right now.
[00:35:35.226 --> 00:35:39.028]  I think the disillusionment in Obama is quite palpable.
[00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:43.811]  And I know a lot of people are saying, well, he's got to be an improvement because he's our first black president.
[00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:44.511]  But you know something?
[00:35:44.871 --> 00:35:46.272]  Idi Amin was a black president.
[00:35:46.312 --> 00:35:49.374]  That didn't work out too well for the people of his country.
[00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:55.382]  So, we've got to move away from whether Obama was black or white, and we've got to look at what the guy is doing.
[00:35:55.442 --> 00:35:58.025]  And what the guy is doing is just more of the same.
[00:35:58.526 --> 00:35:59.968]  I'm thoroughly disillusioned with him.
[00:35:59.988 --> 00:36:01.470]  There was a story we ran earlier today.
[00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.235]  Bob Dylan, who had supported him, is now backing off and saying it was a mistake.
[00:36:05.915 --> 00:36:14.258]  It's getting harder and harder to find somebody who truly is still fanatically believing in Barack Obama outside of his immediate circle of financial supporters.
[00:36:14.738 --> 00:36:25.282]  And I gotta tell you, I don't even trust the polling numbers that we're seeing regarding his public approval because they're not lining up with the numerous online polls that we're seeing in websites, including my own.
[00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:27.343]  It's more of the same.
[00:36:29.984 --> 00:36:36.487]  He's going to do what he was being told to do, and then the corporate media will lie and tell us that we all love him and therefore we should shut up about it.
[00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:48.171]  Well, I mean, that's the big issue here is that a lot of people were so horrified by Bush and the secret arrest and the torture and the wars, they said, look, we just hope Obama's better.
[00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:52.032]  And then now if you criticize Obama, some of the
[00:36:53.792 --> 00:36:56.913]  More uninformed supporters think that you're saying the Republicans are good.
[00:36:57.353 --> 00:36:58.434]  No, that's the whole point.
[00:36:58.474 --> 00:37:00.875]  That's why we made the Obama deception.
[00:37:00.915 --> 00:37:12.399]  It's showing you that there's a puppet master controlling both puppets, and we want the people to look past the puppets to the puppet master, and what their agenda is, hey, let's indict and arrest the bankers.
[00:37:12.879 --> 00:37:28.268]  And you know, Mike, you're saying that's going to be hard to do because you have this shared corruption in the establishment that's bringing down Mexico, that brought down Rome, that's brought down so many ancient and modern civilizations and nations, where soon it's just a bunch of crooks and none of them will...
[00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:33.150]  Control the other ones so they just steal everything and then everything falls apart.
[00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.131]  We're now entering that phase.
[00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:41.592]  I mean, clearly they're leaving nothing in the nation when they steal the GDP in six months.
[00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:46.354]  And so you have this shared corruption as things get worse and worse.
[00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:47.674]  We've got to explain to people.
[00:37:48.394 --> 00:37:56.685]  Either the globalists stay in power and get more control out of the crisis they created, or we put the brakes on it and say, arrest these criminals.
[00:37:57.206 --> 00:38:01.912]  You know, instead of just protesting, I don't like the bailout, I don't like the banks, go, these are a bunch of crooks!
[00:38:02.352 --> 00:38:04.015]  We've got to arrest these people!
[00:38:04.275 --> 00:38:08.636]  You know, that needs to be the mantra, is prosecute them for the crimes they've committed.
[00:38:09.136 --> 00:38:14.958]  That is the only way, because they're going to continue to control the voting machines, they're going to continue to control both parties.
[00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:20.320]  So the revolution is just enforcing the law and arresting these people.
[00:38:21.431 --> 00:38:30.398]  Yeah, absolutely, and I think once you get into that area where we the people are going to start enforcing the laws of this country, then it's a whole different dynamic.
[00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:41.748]  What it really comes down to, though, if you look about all this $12 trillion that has been dumped in debt on the American people, we the American people don't have to pay it.
[00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:56.018]  I mean, if you really think about it, go through the Constitution and somebody show me where I signed a contract that I would allow the government to borrow this money and stick me with the payments because I don't remember ever doing that.
[00:38:56.298 --> 00:38:57.779]  There is no such contract.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.922]  And the bottom line is American people have to start thinking about this.
[00:39:01.482 --> 00:39:02.163]  If the U.S.
[00:39:02.223 --> 00:39:03.824]  government goes away, if we stop
[00:39:04.224 --> 00:39:23.396]  doing what the government says if we simply do not cooperate if we walk away and let it collapse it's going to take that debt with it and we're not going to have to pay it and so this is something that those people are saying we should support the government right or wrong and everything okay but if you do it's going to cost you forty thousand dollars plus accruing interest
[00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:35.020]  To support the government and at the end, after you've worked your life away to pay off that debt, you're still going to have a government that's fondling you at the airports, reading your emails, listening to your phone calls, watching you with TV cameras.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.921]  What kind of a deal is that after a lifetime of work?
[00:39:38.461 --> 00:39:40.902]  And I think people are looking at that very hard right now.
[00:39:41.402 --> 00:39:42.122]  Well, exactly.
[00:39:42.182 --> 00:39:44.403]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:39:45.043 --> 00:39:51.225]  And we have admitted offshore banks and corporations that have gotten the lion's share of the $12.8 trillion just out of the U.S.
[00:39:51.245 --> 00:39:51.765]  taxpayers.
[00:39:52.225 --> 00:39:58.267]  It's close to $12 trillion from all the other nations that are run by these private banking cartels feeding into them.
[00:39:58.627 --> 00:39:59.948]  They've cut off liquidity.
[00:40:00.028 --> 00:40:00.768]  They're greedily...
[00:40:01.448 --> 00:40:06.991]  Killing the real economy so they, the fiat economy, the vampire economy, can come in and consolidate.
[00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:08.712]  This is a great conquest.
[00:40:08.752 --> 00:40:13.014]  This is a usurper group taking over our society.
[00:40:13.034 --> 00:40:22.720]  I mean, this is designed, Mike, their own documents show it, and I don't think the public, as mad as they are now, has realized the full horror of what we're facing.
[00:40:23.786 --> 00:40:26.008]  Well, it really comes down to a very simple fact.
[00:40:26.068 --> 00:40:38.197]  The instant you start a debt-based economic system, such as the Federal Reserve, the moment it goes into operation, more money is owed to that central bank than is actually in existence.
[00:40:38.597 --> 00:40:46.924]  And the only way such a system can continue to operate is there must always be an ever-expanding population of borrowers which are used to create new money, or
[00:40:47.404 --> 00:40:55.566]  The country must engage in wars of conquest to loot other nations to bring that extra money back in to pay the existing loans to the central bank.
[00:40:55.846 --> 00:41:08.870]  The problem with creating such a central bank on a global scale is there is no way for new money to come into the system and the people living under that system will be permanently, perpetually enslaved to debt in perpetuity.
[00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.030]  Their children, their grandchildren forever.
[00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:12.931]  And by the way, Mike, as you know,
[00:41:13.976 --> 00:41:14.856]  I want you to speak to this.
[00:41:14.896 --> 00:41:21.658]  We saw the spectacle last week at the G20 meeting with literally hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[00:41:21.718 --> 00:41:26.259]  Time Magazine, Obama's New World Order, you know, London Telegraph, other headlines.
[00:41:27.399 --> 00:41:31.520]  World leaders hail birth of New World Order and then they define the New World Order.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.161]  They say it's a global private central bank
[00:41:34.981 --> 00:41:50.167]  That will set currencies, values, that will set interest rates, and that will set the tax rates of the nations where there's nowhere to run, and they said there'll be nowhere to run, and the bankers were all smiling and laughing saying, we'll dominate everything.
[00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:52.548]  I mean, the criminals that engineered the collapse
[00:41:53.288 --> 00:42:11.640]  Are openly saying it's a Ponzi scheme to get control of the planet, and that we're going to literally be serfs to them, and the OECD, their big management group, says they want a global tax of over 80% on the average person, because they state they want a post-industrial economy.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:17.183]  It's the parasite economy, the fake bank economy, waging war on the real economy.
[00:42:17.383 --> 00:42:18.164]  Can you speak to that?
[00:42:18.973 --> 00:42:30.776]  Well, economies do wage war on each other, and years ago when they were talking about clash of civilization between the West and the Muslim world, it's because at the core of it, it's two different banking systems.
[00:42:30.816 --> 00:42:35.698]  The Western system is based on compounding of interest, which has led to runaway debt and ruination
[00:42:36.078 --> 00:42:41.642]  For millions of people, while creating vast amounts of wealth concentrated in the hands of a few people.
[00:42:41.942 --> 00:42:48.327]  On the other hand, you have the Islamic banking system, where loans are handled as a flat fee, and there's no compounding of interest.
[00:42:48.707 --> 00:42:59.155]  And the Islamic bankers are not incredibly wealthy, but right now, the Islamic banks are absolutely immune from all of this meltdown and derivatives problem that is crippling the Western banks.
[00:42:59.175 --> 00:43:04.419]  So when they talk about clash of civilizations, yeah, they're talking about war between different economic
[00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:05.039]  Models.
[00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:07.140]  What was the war between the United States and Russia?
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.241]  Capitalism versus communism.
[00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:10.841]  What was the war against Italy?
[00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:12.142]  Capitalism against fascism.
[00:43:12.422 --> 00:43:26.247]  Now we've become the fascist and we're attempting to bring fascism to the rest of the world and the rest of the world is starting to dig in their heels and that unfortunately bodes very very ill for the future of the United States because we cannot win a new world war.
[00:43:26.447 --> 00:43:28.648]  We don't have the manufacturing capacity to do it.
[00:43:29.068 --> 00:43:32.009]  Well, what about the Civil War, according to Lincoln and others?
[00:43:32.049 --> 00:43:33.749]  What was about economic control?
[00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:36.710]  Was the North going to control Western expansion or was the South?
[00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.310]  It all comes back to this.
[00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.630]  Yes, it absolutely does.
[00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:46.932]  And Lincoln had the advantage that he could use the emancipation of the slaves as a popularizing device for the Civil War.
[00:43:47.172 --> 00:43:50.792]  If he hadn't had that, I think the North would have actually lost the Civil War.
[00:43:51.693 --> 00:43:52.953]  That was their moral authority.
[00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:54.979]  That was the moral authority, yes.
[00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:58.680]  And our country doesn't really have a moral authority to work with right now.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.980]  They're trying to find one.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.821]  They're trying to find a new Emanuel Goldstein supervillain.
[00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.823]  They had Osama Bin Laden, but too many people know he's dead.
[00:44:06.103 --> 00:44:09.424]  They tried to float Adam Gadahn, the American Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:09.464 --> 00:44:12.265]  Too many people know that he's actually the grandson of an ADL person.
[00:44:12.805 --> 00:44:13.986]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:21.952]  They're trying to manufacture a villain or a cause or something from which they can derive moral authority to invade somebody else's home.
[00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:28.016]  And they're trying to do it in a world that knows the United States government lied to start the war in Iraq.
[00:44:28.216 --> 00:44:30.138]  They're raising on a busted flesh here.
[00:44:30.578 --> 00:44:31.660]  But they don't have any choice.
[00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:39.211]  The people who control them won't let them step off the path, won't let them change course, won't listen to reason that this is not going to work.
[00:44:39.472 --> 00:44:43.898]  They're going to roll the dice with millions of other people's lives and just see, hey, let's see what happens.
[00:44:43.918 --> 00:44:44.419]  That'll be fun.
[00:44:45.222 --> 00:44:49.223]  Because you can attack the globalists, but one thing you gotta give them is they are bold.
[00:44:49.763 --> 00:44:50.524]  They are cunning.
[00:44:50.564 --> 00:44:51.784]  They have amazing will.
[00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:54.045]  And they will risk the whole planet.
[00:44:54.085 --> 00:44:55.805]  It's like when they detonated the first A-bomb.
[00:44:56.205 --> 00:44:59.326]  Most of the scientists thought it was gonna ignite the entire atmosphere and destroy the planet.
[00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:01.047]  That's on record, but they still did it.
[00:45:01.727 --> 00:45:04.890]  So, uh, just like, uh, the Hadron, uh, you know, Heavy Collider.
[00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.833]  Some of their physicists said, let's create a black hole or a strangelet.
[00:45:07.873 --> 00:45:08.373]  Let's do it.
[00:45:09.314 --> 00:45:10.976]  Uh, you know, you gotta give it to them.
[00:45:11.036 --> 00:45:15.200]  They are bold, they are cunning, they are ruthless, they are reckless.
[00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:19.077]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:22.919]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:25.681]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:33.046]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:45:33.186 --> 00:45:33.466]  I think so.
[00:45:56.517 --> 00:45:59.080]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:22.668]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:28.712]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:46:29.252 --> 00:46:35.436]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:46:35.736 --> 00:46:37.577]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:46:37.717 --> 00:46:40.099]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:46:40.179 --> 00:46:49.925]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[00:46:50.396 --> 00:46:51.097]  That's fascism.
[00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:54.640]  It's not about left or right.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.441]  It's about a one world government.
[00:46:56.902 --> 00:47:03.247]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:48:22.495 --> 00:48:27.398]  Alright, final segment with Mike Rivera, then I'm going to get into Glenn Beck and his disinformation for 30 minutes.
[00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:33.883]  Then we have a guest coming on with just a very painful story, but her son was killed on the Greyhound bus eight months ago.
[00:48:34.103 --> 00:48:37.185]  Person cut his head off, stabbed him over a hundred times, ate his eyeballs.
[00:48:38.126 --> 00:48:39.907]  And they're talking about letting him out of jail.
[00:48:42.054 --> 00:48:44.478]  So another psychiatric person on Prozac.
[00:48:45.399 --> 00:48:46.781]  That is coming up.
[00:48:47.342 --> 00:48:48.384]  He killed him with a knife.
[00:48:48.404 --> 00:48:49.245]  It would have been a gun.
[00:48:49.265 --> 00:48:50.747]  They'd be trying to ban the guns, I guess.
[00:48:51.569 --> 00:48:53.512]  Just a horrid story, but we're going to be covering it.
[00:48:56.209 --> 00:48:59.890]  And then we're going to have open phones in the fourth hour today.
[00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:00.931]  Wide open phones.
[00:49:00.951 --> 00:49:05.512]  I've got a lot of other news here as well, but I wanted to play this clip for Mike Rivero.
[00:49:05.813 --> 00:49:06.833]  This is an amazing clip.
[00:49:06.853 --> 00:49:11.695]  Last night Lou Dobbs, we're analyzing this clip right now, short clip, Lou Dobbs
[00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:15.198]  He's got the President of Mexico on, and I listen to Mexican radio.
[00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:18.401]  And they have it in some English versions as well.
[00:49:19.042 --> 00:49:23.907]  And they admit that the government's laundering the drugs, that most of the Mexican government is, that U.S.
[00:49:23.947 --> 00:49:26.370]  banks even have a loophole where they can launder the money.
[00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:30.774]  And it's now in the ABC News about big banks and brokerage firms doing it.
[00:49:31.615 --> 00:49:34.718]  And Calderon says, look, you've got government officials helping in the U.S.
[00:49:35.842 --> 00:49:37.385]  And Lou Dobbs says, yeah, I've looked at this.
[00:49:37.485 --> 00:49:38.407]  I have to agree with you.
[00:49:38.707 --> 00:49:39.950]  So it's all coming out, folks.
[00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:42.294]  All the lies, like Mike Rivero just said, are coming out.
[00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:42.614]  Here it is.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:53.747]  And at the Mexican border tonight, strong words from President Felipe Calderon of Mexico in response to mounting violence in his country in the war on the drug cartels.
[00:49:54.327 --> 00:50:04.255]  President Calderon met with Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to talk about actions against illegal aliens, guns, and drugs.
[00:50:04.855 --> 00:50:08.418]  President Calderon made his position on drug trafficking crystal clear.
[00:50:08.938 --> 00:50:13.222]  He said that the United States is just as guilty of corruption as Mexico.
[00:50:14.062 --> 00:50:20.266]  It is impossible to pass tons of drugs or cocaine to U.S.
[00:50:21.046 --> 00:50:25.930]  without some grade of complicity of the some American authorities.
[00:50:27.046 --> 00:50:32.751]  There is traffic in Mexico because there is corruption in Mexico.
[00:50:33.492 --> 00:50:34.373]  And that is true.
[00:50:35.213 --> 00:50:45.582]  But with the same argument, if there is traffic in the United States, it's because there is some corruption in the United States.
[00:50:47.364 --> 00:50:50.727]  I don't often agree with President Calderón on any issue.
[00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:52.790]  This time I have to.
[00:50:53.311 --> 00:50:54.813]  There is no other explanation.
[00:50:55.454 --> 00:51:05.067]  It goes well beyond indifference and apathy to the fact that this country has tolerated that border being violated by drug traffickers who bring in from Mexico
[00:51:06.061 --> 00:51:08.663]  Methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.
[00:51:08.884 --> 00:51:10.825]  In fact, Mexico is the largest source.
[00:51:11.406 --> 00:51:23.877]  And for us as a nation to have tolerated the immense loss of life, the devastation of lives, to addiction of drugs, most of which, again, originated in Mexico, can only be explained by corruption.
[00:51:24.478 --> 00:51:25.579]  All right, let me stop right there.
[00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:27.501]  I'm going to hold Mike over five more minutes so he can comment.
[00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:32.062]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've talked to Lou Dobbs off air.
[00:51:32.102 --> 00:51:33.183]  I've had him on air before.
[00:51:33.443 --> 00:51:34.644]  He is the real deal.
[00:51:34.944 --> 00:51:36.706]  He has a contract where he can say what he wants.
[00:51:36.866 --> 00:51:43.193]  He's being attacked by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white supremacist because he's fighting the New World Order.
[00:51:43.413 --> 00:51:44.815]  That's what they do.
[00:51:44.995 --> 00:51:45.675]  He ought to sue them.
[00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:47.918]  I'm also attacked in this issue.
[00:51:48.678 --> 00:51:51.401]  So the point is, Lou Dobbs is for real.
[00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:53.163]  He's got a lot of courage.
[00:51:53.423 --> 00:51:56.927]  Glenn Beck is a counterfeit of a patriot, meant to co-opt our movement.
[00:51:56.947 --> 00:52:08.377]  And Mike, I want you to comment on the drug dealing, but I also want you to comment, it wasn't hard to predict that Beck was acting like a patriot from his past activities and was going to quote, debunk the FEMA camps when he promised to, you know, investigate them.
[00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:11.460]  And he, sure enough, did that last night with a straw man argument.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.162]  So, what do you think of that clip?
[00:52:13.202 --> 00:52:14.063]  And then on to Glenn Beck.
[00:52:15.051 --> 00:52:27.299]  Well, unfortunately, I was not able to hear the clip when you were playing it, so I'm not exactly sure, but I mean, there's no secret that our government has been involved with drug dealing going way, way back.
[00:52:27.379 --> 00:52:32.282]  The Skull and Bones fraternity at Yale University was funded with opium money.
[00:52:32.502 --> 00:52:36.584]  We had heroin coming in during Vietnam, Iran, Contra, and all the cocaine.
[00:52:37.045 --> 00:52:40.687]  So, it's a known fact our government leaders are drug traffickers.
[00:52:41.047 --> 00:52:42.128]  Alright Mike, stay there.
[00:52:42.188 --> 00:52:44.189]  I've been trying to talk to you during breaks and you haven't heard me either.
[00:52:44.229 --> 00:52:47.891]  We've got some connection issue there in Hawaii with you or something.
[00:52:47.911 --> 00:52:49.652]  I've been wanting to talk to you off air anyway.
[00:52:49.692 --> 00:52:51.814]  So come back, recap what you just said.
[00:52:51.874 --> 00:52:52.734]  That is so important.
[00:52:53.194 --> 00:52:54.995]  Then we'll move on to Mr. Peck.
[00:52:58.117 --> 00:53:01.479]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:21.570]  Big Brother.
[00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.290]  Mainstream media.
[00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:25.111]  Government cover-ups.
[00:54:25.772 --> 00:54:26.592]  You want answers?
[00:54:27.352 --> 00:54:28.313]  Well, so does he.
[00:54:28.913 --> 00:54:32.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:33.095 --> 00:54:37.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:54:38.462 --> 00:54:40.384]  Okay, we're now into hour number three.
[00:54:40.404 --> 00:54:41.705]  Got hour number four coming up.
[00:54:42.506 --> 00:54:46.509]  In the next two segments, I'm gonna debunk Glenn Beck's debunking of the FEMA camps.
[00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:51.414]  I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I called exactly what he was gonna do.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.001]  In fact, you guys have that clip we played last night on Burmas, where I predicted it before the show.
[00:54:57.021 --> 00:55:00.202]  See if you can cue that back up.
[00:55:00.862 --> 00:55:04.263]  It was like 17 minutes into the second hour, if you want to know where it was at.
[00:55:04.643 --> 00:55:06.664]  Just one of my precise predictions.
[00:55:07.684 --> 00:55:11.045]  It gets scary when you study these people this long, you know what they're going to do before they do it.
[00:55:11.986 --> 00:55:14.168]  Uh, but they're just so predictable, the games they play.
[00:55:14.709 --> 00:55:17.653]  Uh, Mike, if you missed it, I don't know if you've seen it, he did a straw man.
[00:55:17.693 --> 00:55:26.184]  He showed Linda Thompson, who put out the fake video of the tank shooting flame out at Waco to discredit all the serious research of Delta Force and Medley being their shooting people.
[00:55:26.464 --> 00:55:28.907]  They went and showed the, uh, the, uh,
[00:55:29.708 --> 00:55:34.331]  Old train station, now a train repair station, a regional repair station for Amtrak.
[00:55:34.792 --> 00:55:43.878]  And I predicted on air, that's what they'd show, because that's the one big popular thing I know is fake, from this lady who was clearly an operative from the mid-1990s instead of...
[00:55:45.399 --> 00:55:59.347]  The Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, all the documents, the Houston Chronicle, the admissions they're getting ready for martial law, the Army announcing it, you know, bills in Congress for FEMA camps, and then they just come out and say, none of it's true, folks!
[00:55:59.707 --> 00:56:01.108]  It's crazy if you believe it!
[00:56:02.199 --> 00:56:03.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.401]  This is an old, old disinformation tactic.
[00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:06.761]  It's called poisoning the well.
[00:56:07.182 --> 00:56:18.948]  And what it means is that the intelligence operatives and the propagandists will plant one provably false piece of information in the middle of a really serious concern of the American people.
[00:56:19.308 --> 00:56:24.631]  And then that's the one that everybody can always point to, to try and ridicule and dismiss the rest.
[00:56:25.311 --> 00:56:27.412]  And we've seen it time and time again.
[00:56:28.292 --> 00:56:38.335]  During the House Select Committee on Assassinations, looking back into the JFK assassination, they planted this silly story about an umbrella dart gun, so that they could all make fun about it.
[00:56:38.575 --> 00:56:47.718]  During the Clinton administration, when they were holding hearings on the abuses of the BATF, they had a guy show up in full camo, screaming that the government had a machine that made tornadoes.
[00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:57.422]  This is an old, old trick, and the good news is most Americans are now aware that this is one of the tactics that the government will pull when they don't want to talk about a real issue.
[00:56:58.443 --> 00:56:59.143]  Exactly, or...
[00:57:01.431 --> 00:57:08.555]  I mean, there's so many examples of this that we've seen over and over and over again, and it just isn't working.
[00:57:08.595 --> 00:57:21.723]  I mean, how can the mainstream media, out of one side of its mouth, say they're setting up world government, but it's good, but then say we're crazy, it doesn't exist on the other, and then point at, you know, some UFO website, you know, and then say that's us.
[00:57:21.783 --> 00:57:24.125]  I mean, people are more discerning than that now.
[00:57:25.219 --> 00:57:30.741]  Well, we have to remember that government and even the New World Order crew are not a monolithic structure.
[00:57:30.961 --> 00:57:32.722]  They're all deeply factionalized.
[00:57:32.862 --> 00:57:42.126]  Each is pushing their own particular agenda, and from these conflicting agendas, we are seeing these multiple points of view come out that will be self-contradictory.
[00:57:42.446 --> 00:57:52.890]  And it is a good thing to allow it to happen, because ordinary people reading these stories where this person says red and this other person says green, and they'll say, wait a minute, something's not right here, and it will
[00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.511]  Convince them to maybe dig a little bit deeper.
[00:57:55.591 --> 00:58:01.573]  And when they start digging deeper, that's when they're going to realize the extent to which they're being misled by the government and by the corporate media.
[00:58:01.833 --> 00:58:06.956]  And that's when they show up at PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, and WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:58:07.716 --> 00:58:08.396]  Absolutely.
[00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:12.498]  Well, Mike Rivero, in closing, continue your good work there.
[00:58:12.778 --> 00:58:14.539]  I'm just really worried about Obama.
[00:58:15.319 --> 00:58:18.381]  Cyber security bill gives Obama real power over the internet.
[00:58:18.922 --> 00:58:32.351]  I mean, you know, sure, they're not going to get away with this, but the mere fact that they're saying they're taking the internet over, making private companies give the feds hubs in to snoop without warrants and to be able to shut the web down, I mean, that's their words to protect it, of course.
[00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:38.095]  I'm really worried about them launching a fake cyber attack and blaming it on China.
[00:58:39.124 --> 00:58:45.866]  Well, remember, the fastest way to bring down a dictator is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it, and that's what's going on with the U.S.
[00:58:45.906 --> 00:58:46.747]  government right now.
[00:58:46.987 --> 00:58:49.488]  They're acting like a dictatorship, and everybody sees it.
[00:58:50.428 --> 00:58:52.529]  Alright, Mike Rivera, we'll talk to you again next month.
[00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:53.209]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:58:55.421 --> 00:58:55.942]  There he goes.
[00:58:56.002 --> 00:58:57.023]  Aloha from Hawaii.
[00:58:57.123 --> 00:58:58.865]  Always great to have Mike on once a month.
[00:58:59.365 --> 00:59:00.226]  Always informative.
[00:59:00.266 --> 00:59:01.387]  Great banter back and forth.
[00:59:01.808 --> 00:59:08.275]  Okay, I'm going to play this Russia Today news clip that they just aired worldwide on television where I really think I boiled things down well.
[00:59:08.595 --> 00:59:10.857]  Then I'm going to get into Glenn Beck and a lot more.
[00:59:11.558 --> 00:59:12.779]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:12.839 --> 00:59:14.181]  The show has just begun.
[00:59:14.221 --> 00:59:15.763]  The info has just begun.
[00:59:17.222 --> 00:59:24.867]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:59:25.307 --> 00:59:26.468]  You need the Paclite!
[00:59:26.908 --> 00:59:34.753]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:59:35.134 --> 00:59:38.296]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:59:38.696 --> 00:59:43.139]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:59:43.519 --> 00:59:44.800]  The Paclite is so durable.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:49.462]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:59:49.882 --> 00:59:54.183]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:59:54.543 --> 01:00:01.206]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[01:00:01.546 --> 01:00:03.467]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.
[01:00:05.107 --> 01:00:06.628]  Or, call us today at 877-715-4448.
[01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:06.908]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:00:06.928 --> 01:00:11.671]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:00:23.164 --> 01:00:28.527]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:00:29.047 --> 01:00:35.230]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.371]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:00:37.511 --> 01:00:39.892]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:00:39.972 --> 01:00:50.878]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:00:53.169 --> 01:00:54.449]  It's not about left or right.
[01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:56.190]  It's about a one world government.
[01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:03.051]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:11.393]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:11.853 --> 01:01:13.013]  The Obama Deception.
[01:01:13.413 --> 01:01:14.694]  The people strike back.
[01:01:20.455 --> 01:01:21.615]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[01:01:22.017 --> 01:01:26.539]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.963]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:35.544]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[01:01:35.824 --> 01:01:38.465]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[01:01:38.805 --> 01:01:42.467]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[01:01:42.487 --> 01:01:42.547]  Not?
[01:01:44.389 --> 01:01:48.810]  Get the T. Change your body and life from unhealthy to healthy.

[01:02:18.143 --> 01:02:24.148]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:02:24.748 --> 01:02:27.790]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:31.874]  We are back live, now eight minutes into the third hour.
[01:02:31.894 --> 01:02:36.077]  Gonna debunk Glenn Beck's ridiculous debunking.
[01:02:36.097 --> 01:02:36.877]  And this is a big deal.
[01:02:36.978 --> 01:02:38.479]  I'm not just attacking some talk show host.
[01:02:38.859 --> 01:02:39.700]  I don't care about that.
[01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.302]  It's that he's positioning himself
[01:02:44.088 --> 01:02:51.194]  As the 9-12 leader, the leader of the Patriot Movement against the New World Order, and the guy is a operative period, so that's coming up.
[01:02:51.814 --> 01:02:56.658]  But first I want to play part of this 10-minute interview Russia Today did with me.
[01:02:56.678 --> 01:02:58.400]  The rest is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.162]  I think one of the fairest interviews that I've ever done.
[01:03:01.202 --> 01:03:04.124]  They just asked the questions and let me answer them and didn't even really edit it.
[01:03:05.125 --> 01:03:07.287]  Just amazing to see that going on.
[01:03:07.307 --> 01:03:13.032]  I can go on, you know, foreign television, Japanese, Russian, South African, they just let me talk.
[01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:17.338]  The United States media tries to engage in a blackout, but they're not in control of the world.
[01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:27.312]  Before we go to this Russia Today clip, we live in an unprecedented, unpredictable world, and as everyone knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[01:03:28.547 --> 01:03:31.509]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:38.053]  That's why I want you to visit our new sponsor, Pepperspray.com to check out their wide variety of personal security products.
[01:03:38.354 --> 01:03:40.295]  They're available on their website since 1994.
[01:03:40.495 --> 01:03:45.398]  Pepperspray.com has made your personal safety their number one priority.
[01:03:45.518 --> 01:03:46.599]  So give them a call at 1-800-908-9988.
[01:03:46.619 --> 01:03:47.460]  Again, that number is 1-800-908-9988.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.942]  Or visit them at Pepperspray.com and give yourself some peace of mind.
[01:03:50.982 --> 01:03:51.642]  On the web since 1994.
[01:03:58.687 --> 01:04:01.491]  So they sell a wide variety of personal safety and security products.
[01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:05.557]  You're not only getting security, but peace of mind you deserve as well.
[01:04:05.657 --> 01:04:07.399]  Free shipping on all orders above $99.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.562]  Pepper spray of all kinds and strengths.
[01:04:09.622 --> 01:04:11.805]  Stun guns and tasers at incredibly low prices.
[01:04:12.346 --> 01:04:15.630]  Antibolt repellents, home safety and personal alarms, and a lot more.
[01:04:16.818 --> 01:04:22.285]  One other sponsor making this radio show possible is MySolarBackup.com.
[01:04:22.305 --> 01:04:28.874]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, like hurricanes, snow, ice storms, economic collapse, you name it.
[01:04:29.215 --> 01:04:30.997]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[01:04:31.798 --> 01:04:32.998]  And here's a good way to do just that.
[01:04:33.018 --> 01:04:37.079]  A solar power generator is now available from our long-time sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:42.721]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any natural disaster or outage.
[01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:50.283]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity
[01:04:50.703 --> 01:04:52.144]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[01:04:52.385 --> 01:04:57.689]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.493]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:05:01.553 --> 01:05:03.514]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:05:03.895 --> 01:05:07.037]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.
[01:05:07.378 --> 01:05:09.520]  Their website's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.161]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:11.181 --> 01:05:12.162]  You can always give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:12.342]  That's 877-327.
[01:05:16.866 --> 01:05:18.507]  Zero, three, six, five.
[01:05:18.808 --> 01:05:30.577]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to this Russia Today piece, because a lot of folks are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv or want to hear the audio as the radio listeners, so we'll go ahead and play that for everybody.
[01:05:30.737 --> 01:05:35.461]  And I think I succinctly, in ten minutes, boil things down very simply to the world audience.
[01:05:35.481 --> 01:05:35.821]  Here it is.
[01:05:42.725 --> 01:05:48.790]  RT is in Austin, Texas, catching up with radio talk show host and documentary filmmaker Alex Jones.
[01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:50.952]  Alex, thanks for sitting down with us today.
[01:05:51.452 --> 01:05:59.339]  My first question is, several months after Obama stepped in as President of the United States, you make a documentary calling him a deceiver.
[01:05:59.579 --> 01:05:59.839]  Why?
[01:06:00.259 --> 01:06:01.901]  He said he wouldn't hire lobbyists.
[01:06:02.181 --> 01:06:05.423]  All he's done is hire high-powered lobbyists.
[01:06:06.351 --> 01:06:07.392]  at every level of government.
[01:06:07.892 --> 01:06:16.558]  And he's handed the country over to the oligarchs, the international bankers, to loot the nation, according to Bloomberg Financial, of $9.7 trillion.
[01:06:17.259 --> 01:06:19.620]  He has lied about leaving Iraq.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.622]  He said he would take the troops out immediately.
[01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.083]  Now he says 16 to 23 months.
[01:06:24.804 --> 01:06:25.765]  And he's going to keep them there.
[01:06:26.145 --> 01:06:29.367]  He's increased the troops by 30,000, doubling them in Afghanistan.
[01:06:29.687 --> 01:06:31.528]  He's bombing Pakistan.
[01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:37.231]  Barack Obama promised that he would only raise taxes on those making over a quarter million dollars a year.
[01:06:37.731 --> 01:06:48.818]  He's now announced, Wall Street Journal, he's going to change all the loopholes to tax all Americans, taking away our waivers we have for our homes, taking away the exemptions.
[01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.159]  The lies
[01:06:50.939 --> 01:06:51.899]  The facts are incredible.
[01:06:52.239 --> 01:06:55.160]  Everything Obama has said has been a lie.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.261]  In your work, you talk a lot about the New World Order.
[01:06:58.421 --> 01:06:59.522]  What is the New World Order?
[01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:03.423]  The New World Order is a private group of ultra-rich bankers who are offshore.
[01:07:03.563 --> 01:07:04.783]  They're above the U.S.
[01:07:05.223 --> 01:07:07.584]  They're above Iran, Russia, Venezuela.
[01:07:08.164 --> 01:07:09.325]  They are international.
[01:07:09.565 --> 01:07:15.107]  And they are creating a network of international laws to regulate and control and dominate nations.
[01:07:15.427 --> 01:07:16.247]  They openly state.
[01:07:16.747 --> 01:07:25.532]  That they want to de-industrialize countries, they want to bankrupt the population, they want a poor population that has to go to the government for handouts.
[01:07:25.952 --> 01:07:27.673]  They want a domesticated population.
[01:07:28.013 --> 01:07:32.015]  So the New World Order is what every other dictatorship has called for in history.
[01:07:32.696 --> 01:07:40.220]  They are people who want a planetary dictatorship run by a group of plutocratic financiers.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.042]  It is world government of, for, and by private bankers.
[01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.811]  And what you say is that the American government is a puppet of the New World Order.
[01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:49.492]  Is that right?
[01:07:50.313 --> 01:07:50.953]  Absolutely.
[01:07:51.214 --> 01:07:52.135]  I am a patriot.
[01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:53.556]  I believe in the free market.
[01:07:53.616 --> 01:07:56.319]  I believe in the red, white, and blue Constitution Bill of Rights.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.762]  And everything that the supposed government is doing
[01:08:01.089 --> 01:08:02.350]  It is the opposite of that.
[01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:06.533]  It is 180 degrees from what this nation is supposed to be.
[01:08:06.553 --> 01:08:09.615]  And in every poll, the American people are against the wars.
[01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:12.677]  They are against the open borders.
[01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.518]  They are against the police state.
[01:08:14.959 --> 01:08:22.804]  But the central government does the opposite of what the people wants, and they're setting up this control grid to try to suppress the American people.
[01:08:23.144 --> 01:08:25.946]  How do you see Barack Obama as American President?
[01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:28.488]  President Barack Obama is a deceiver.
[01:08:29.915 --> 01:08:32.976]  He says one thing, and then he does the opposite.
[01:08:33.417 --> 01:08:36.918]  And that's the only thing that is constant with Barack Obama.
[01:08:37.418 --> 01:08:47.863]  He bills himself as anti-establishment, but really he is completely owned and paid for by the establishment.
[01:08:48.483 --> 01:08:50.864]  So how do you see the future of American politics?
[01:08:51.384 --> 01:08:54.566]  The United States is a corrupt empire.
[01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:02.880]  That has been used by international banks and the Global Crime Syndicate to expand their empire worldwide.
[01:09:03.982 --> 01:09:08.288]  They have basically used the United States like a credit card to pay for their world government.
[01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:16.202]  And I see the United States entering the greatest crisis since its founding 235 years ago.
[01:09:16.702 --> 01:09:20.566]  So I see the United States as a hijacked nation.
[01:09:21.427 --> 01:09:28.035]  A nation that is being used as a tool or an engine of international oligarchs, international financiers.
[01:09:28.195 --> 01:09:30.617]  I see the United States in danger of being collapsed.
[01:09:31.772 --> 01:09:36.315]  But at the same time, I see a massive awakening to the globalist agenda taking place.
[01:09:36.975 --> 01:09:41.778]  And so I know that we have a fighting chance of defeating the tyranny.
[01:09:41.898 --> 01:09:47.321]  Following up on that, some people go further and say that a collapse for America is inevitable.
[01:09:47.501 --> 01:09:48.382]  What do you say to that?
[01:09:49.315 --> 01:09:52.539]  The globalists want to have a collapse in the United States.
[01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:56.043]  And yes, we are in a very real danger of collapsing.
[01:09:56.763 --> 01:09:59.046]  Because the central banks have gotten this country deep in debt.
[01:09:59.467 --> 01:10:00.468]  They've done it by design.
[01:10:01.269 --> 01:10:02.610]  And now they've cut off the money supply.
[01:10:03.271 --> 01:10:05.894]  And the economy of the last year has been in a free fall.
[01:10:06.254 --> 01:10:07.376]  Real unemployment's up at 20%.
[01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:14.862]  And so yes, I've seen many scholars in the United States and worldwide talk about the collapse of the United States.
[01:10:15.282 --> 01:10:17.004]  That is a real danger.
[01:10:17.284 --> 01:10:33.578]  But again, the New World Order bankers only want to collapse the United States so that they can come back in, pose as the saviors, and bring control over the nation, and then reform the United States as a fascist engine.
[01:10:34.218 --> 01:10:38.684]  to carry out military operations against any free nation in the world.
[01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:43.691]  They openly state that the United States will be the pit bull, the attack dog.
[01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:49.371]  The American people will be used to go after every free nation in the world.
[01:10:49.712 --> 01:11:01.555]  So the United States is in the process of going from a corrupt oligarchy to a fascistic, Hitlerian pit bull meant to go out and literally wage war against the planet.
[01:11:01.895 --> 01:11:14.279]  Meanwhile, the international financiers will sit in Switzerland and London and Paris and Berlin and blame America for all the tyranny when they own our private Federal Reserve
[01:11:14.679 --> 01:11:15.800]  And are launching the attack.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:28.288]  One of the things you talk about in your film is that the American government is allegedly trying to build a civil army to be able to use unsuspecting civilians for their own purposes.
[01:11:28.308 --> 01:11:29.789]  Can you explain what you mean by that?
[01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:30.229]  Yes.
[01:11:31.049 --> 01:11:41.076]  Legislation has passed the House and the Senate, and they're in the process right now of ratifying it, to create, in the words of the New York Times, a seven million person army.
[01:11:41.516 --> 01:11:42.757]  And they openly state
[01:11:44.292 --> 01:11:55.923]  that citizens will be spying on each other uh... that this will be a paramilitary force domestically and internationally to be a civilian force that after the u.s.
[01:11:55.963 --> 01:12:07.494]  military takes over a country then the civilian military force will come in and administer the country so the united states is being used as a colony of the offshore bankers to create a
[01:12:08.835 --> 01:12:12.080]  You allege that the Bilderberg Group runs the world.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.402]  Who are they exactly?
[01:12:17.878 --> 01:12:25.320]  The Bilderberg Group is the Queen of England, the Queen of the Netherlands, it is the Rockefellers, it is the Rothschilds.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.920]  They write books, they brag about it.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:30.681]  The Rockefeller wrote a book four years ago saying he wants world government and end of U.S.
[01:12:30.701 --> 01:12:31.221]  sovereignty.
[01:12:32.201 --> 01:12:38.642]  And they are these incredibly wealthy, powerful families that play with nations and whole populations like they're a little toy.
[01:12:39.403 --> 01:12:40.963]  And they are outside the laws.
[01:12:41.003 --> 01:12:43.203]  They don't have to follow the laws of the nations they control.
[01:12:43.723 --> 01:12:45.404]  And they come in and buy off the governments
[01:12:46.304 --> 01:12:48.706]  And finance those governments to go along with their aims.
[01:12:49.587 --> 01:13:05.562]  And the New World Order is just a super rich international mafia of oligarchs that are playing God who want to abolish and bankrupt nation states so they can set up an international order where the planet is owned by a private bank.
[01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:09.706]  Some people say in the next couple of years there's going to be a revolution in America.
[01:13:10.847 --> 01:13:11.648]  Could that be possible?
[01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:14.663]  The globalists hate America.
[01:13:15.043 --> 01:13:18.223]  But at the same time they know that the American people are waking up.
[01:13:18.504 --> 01:13:25.565]  And there's over a hundred million armed American citizens who understand that being armed is a basic right and who refuse to be disarmed.
[01:13:26.506 --> 01:13:29.807]  And so yes, we've got the internal government documents, the state police documents.
[01:13:30.267 --> 01:13:32.067]  They are very concerned about a revolution.
[01:13:32.547 --> 01:13:38.609]  Because they know that as they bankrupt the nation, as they turn us into third world slaves, that the people will resist.
[01:13:39.329 --> 01:13:54.470]  And so they're attempting to set up a high-tech police state in the United States as a rearguard action, so that as they've stolen the country blind to build their world government, using the US's energy and money and finance to build it, now they're done with us.
[01:13:55.461 --> 01:14:08.711]  But the final phase is putting a police state in so they can successfully rob the United States without having the American people ever take control of the country and then prosecute them and arrest them.
[01:14:10.532 --> 01:14:13.934]  We'll be right back after this quick break, and I'll start getting into the Glenn Beck issue.
[01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:15.095]  We've got a guest coming on.
[01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:17.016]  I'll get back into Glenn Beck and take your phone calls.
[01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:17.936]  Spring is here.
[01:14:18.197 --> 01:14:18.977]  Growing season.
[01:14:19.157 --> 01:14:21.138]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:14:21.358 --> 01:14:22.759]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:23.720]  Think about it.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.882]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:14:28.122 --> 01:14:31.024]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is
[01:14:31.084 --> 01:14:31.644]  I think so.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.941]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:22.172]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:15:22.673 --> 01:15:29.723]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:15:30.251 --> 01:15:36.433]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:15:36.814 --> 01:15:38.654]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:15:38.814 --> 01:15:41.215]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:15:41.315 --> 01:15:52.240]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.160]  It's not about left or right.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.901]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:15:56.408 --> 01:16:02.731]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:16:11.576 --> 01:16:12.737]  The Obama Deception.
[01:16:13.157 --> 01:16:14.358]  The people strike back.
[01:16:16.835 --> 01:16:19.557]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:16:19.937 --> 01:16:26.502]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:31.185]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.

[01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:51.498]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:55.462]  Call me Duane Daly at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:16:59.725 --> 01:17:02.650]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.

[01:17:05.914 --> 01:17:11.642]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[01:17:16.235 --> 01:17:24.324]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:17:24.484 --> 01:17:28.869]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:17:29.049 --> 01:17:33.554]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:17:33.714 --> 01:17:35.136]  It's a documented fact.
[01:17:35.516 --> 01:17:42.602]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:17:42.762 --> 01:17:54.592]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:17:54.852 --> 01:17:58.516]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:17:59.116 --> 01:18:01.519]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:18:02.259 --> 01:18:05.923]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[01:18:06.003 --> 01:18:09.246]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:18:09.286 --> 01:18:09.487]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:18:32.265 --> 01:18:33.925]  I got behind playing the Russia thing.
[01:18:33.945 --> 01:18:37.126]  When I start the next hour, I'll spend 15 minutes debunking Glenn Beck.
[01:18:38.267 --> 01:18:40.267]  I did it for like an hour last night with Burmess.
[01:18:41.427 --> 01:18:43.048]  That's up at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:18:44.228 --> 01:18:49.949]  It's just to see so many of my listeners suckered by this guy going, no, he really wants to fight the New World Order, Alex.
[01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:51.470]  Glenn's good.
[01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:53.230]  I'm like, no, man, he's not.
[01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:55.651]  This guy is a slam ball from the word go.
[01:18:57.426 --> 01:19:00.207]  Believe me, I would love it if he was a good guy.
[01:19:00.547 --> 01:19:02.047]  But I knew it would be more debunking.
[01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:10.489]  This is a guy that always said, arrest the militias, arrest the patriots, they're killers, they're McVeigh-tives, Ron Paul's dangerous, his listeners are dangerous, go after them.
[01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:12.790]  We played those clips here.
[01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:18.651]  Then he said, oh, I'm exposing the New World Order, I'm exposing the global currency, once it was already announced.
[01:19:18.691 --> 01:19:20.532]  See, now Hannity comes out and says it's bad.
[01:19:21.294 --> 01:19:23.576]  But then he shovels in all their other propaganda.
[01:19:24.057 --> 01:19:27.340]  They're being forced to do this now because they've lost all credibility.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:30.203]  I mean, these guys, in the case of Hannity and Limbaugh...
[01:19:31.482 --> 01:19:32.162]  For decades.
[01:19:32.462 --> 01:19:36.044]  Hannity's for about 8 years, and Limboffer was at almost 20 now.
[01:19:36.464 --> 01:19:37.344]  None of this exists.
[01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:37.844]  It's not real.
[01:19:37.864 --> 01:19:40.545]  And we're like, but the CFR publishes a bi-monthly book.
[01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:44.626]  It says global government and a global carbon tax, and they're going to take our guns.
[01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.307]  Shut up!
[01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:46.847]  The CFR doesn't exist.
[01:19:47.467 --> 01:19:52.189]  But the UN, biological, oh, we're hanging up on you, another one of the crazy people.
[01:19:53.069 --> 01:19:55.390]  Hey, they just had urban warfare drills here in my town.
[01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:57.330]  Oh, that's another black helicopter crazy.
[01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.671]  Meanwhile, it'd be in the local paper.
[01:20:01.909 --> 01:20:03.230]  And then now it's in Tennessee News.
[01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:07.653]  Oh yeah, the Army wasn't allowed to, but they still came out and ran checkpoints.
[01:20:08.374 --> 01:20:09.174]  Let's play that now.
[01:20:09.214 --> 01:20:10.155]  I forgot to get to that.
[01:20:10.535 --> 01:20:11.996]  We'll do that during the little space we have.
[01:20:13.478 --> 01:20:15.539]  This story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:20:15.579 --> 01:20:16.960]  Kurt Nimmo writes so many stories.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.061]  What a powerhouse.
[01:20:18.121 --> 01:20:23.985]  It's already moved into the archive of the News in Focus feature news story piece.
[01:20:24.766 --> 01:20:28.309]  But I had the state rep on yesterday and
[01:20:31.732 --> 01:20:54.258]  You know, he talked about how they had told the Army they couldn't operate, but what we didn't know then was they went ahead this weekend, that's now confirmed mainstream news, and had the Army and the Marines, what is it, MPs from the Air Force Base out running checkpoints on citizens, and it said there was traffic backed up for a mile on one road.
[01:20:54.838 --> 01:20:57.338]  So the Governor says don't do this, and they say, you know what?
[01:20:57.838 --> 01:20:58.439]  Shut up!
[01:20:58.799 --> 01:20:59.879]  We run things now!
[01:21:01.294 --> 01:21:02.446]  Let's play part of the state rep.
[01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:02.749]  Here it is.
[01:21:04.898 --> 01:21:12.900]  The Whiteville Police Department had plans to conduct a seatbelt checkpoint on Saturday, April 4th at Highway 64 within the city limits of Whiteville.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:20.141]  The checkpoint was planned to be in conjunction with Homeland Security and the 251st Military Police in Bolivar.
[01:21:20.781 --> 01:21:27.403]  After learning about this, I contacted Representative Johnny Shaw, who represents that area, to ask you about this.
[01:21:27.743 --> 01:21:32.504]  Representative Shaw, you looked into this, and can you tell me what you've learned and where this stands now?
[01:21:33.423 --> 01:21:33.883]  I can.
[01:21:34.743 --> 01:21:36.744]  Actually, this has been canceled.
[01:21:37.264 --> 01:21:43.326]  Some calls were made to the governor's office about this on earlier today, this Friday.
[01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:47.107]  And of course, the governor just simply said, I don't need another headache.
[01:21:48.707 --> 01:21:49.808]  And of course, it has been.
[01:21:50.308 --> 01:21:54.229]  And I will say that it is it was a bad idea in the first place.
[01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:57.770]  I mean, doing this climate in this day and time, which we live,
[01:21:58.257 --> 01:22:02.480]  Can you imagine the army stopping you for a seatbelt check?
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.122]  So it really was a bad idea.
[01:22:05.142 --> 01:22:10.626]  I don't think it'll happen again because I think it would have frightened more people than it would have helped.
[01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:12.847]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:14.929]  I wasn't clear with the guys.
[01:22:15.109 --> 01:22:18.711]  That was the interview after we broke the news last Thursday.
[01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:22.234]  That was him Friday on the radio saying he talked to the governor.
[01:22:22.254 --> 01:22:24.595]  The governor said no to the unannounced plan.
[01:22:24.615 --> 01:22:26.577]  Then we interviewed the state rep yesterday.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.584]  We had Johnny Shaw on here, and he still thought it had been cancelled.
[01:22:31.844 --> 01:22:38.851]  But then we started having truck drivers and listeners and others send us pictures of Marines and Army and running around with their guns on the streets.
[01:22:40.152 --> 01:22:44.896]  In fact, we're so busy, we need to get that out of the tips inbox and get that posted to the Marines.
[01:22:45.437 --> 01:22:49.080]  But it doesn't matter, we have mainstream news, Merriam County News and others.
[01:22:50.251 --> 01:23:07.819]  And it says, on March 31st, 2009, so this even happened before that, reported on a truck checkpoint set up by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Homeland Security, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the Tennessee Department of Health, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, the Tennessee Department of Transportation, the Tennessee Department of Revenue, the Marion County Sheriff's Department,
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:20.466]  Montego Police Department, the Tennessee National Guard, the Arnold Air Force Base Police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Department of Commerce and Insurance, and the FBI.
[01:23:21.427 --> 01:23:22.728]  And we've confirmed Marines are on.
[01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:26.170]  This was all over the state just randomly, and it went on this weekend.
[01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:29.212]  And so the governor's saying, I can't, you're not allowed to do that.
[01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:31.393]  Meanwhile, it's just going on all over the state.
[01:23:32.714 --> 01:23:33.875]  Last week and this weekend.
[01:23:35.805 --> 01:23:40.709]  And we're just here calmly talking about troops popping up running checkpoints.
[01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:43.632]  And it describes how they were searching everybody's vehicles.
[01:23:43.672 --> 01:23:47.135]  Just randomly walking the highway and searching everybody's cars.
[01:23:49.381 --> 01:23:52.482]  And we got these on video in Texas going on back in the late 90s.
[01:23:52.682 --> 01:23:57.744]  This is a covert operation to acclimate the public and to train the police to go under federal control.
[01:23:58.505 --> 01:24:02.586]  So, man, the bankers are really planning on gutting this nation, folks.
[01:24:02.927 --> 01:24:06.288]  And they're going to turn the men with guns loose on us, and the men with guns are going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:24:07.048 --> 01:24:07.929]  We're on the march.
[01:24:08.429 --> 01:24:10.029]  The empire's on the run.
[01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:13.631]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:16.576 --> 01:24:18.097]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:24:18.277 --> 01:24:19.718]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:24:20.018 --> 01:24:22.259]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:24:22.699 --> 01:24:27.441]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:24:27.842 --> 01:24:30.683]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:24:31.023 --> 01:24:34.345]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:24:34.932 --> 01:24:46.927]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:24:47.487 --> 01:24:49.490]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:50.791]  I use one every day.
[01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:53.655]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:24:54.035 --> 01:24:58.477]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:28.561]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:25:29.102 --> 01:25:35.285]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:25:35.606 --> 01:25:37.427]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:25:37.567 --> 01:25:39.968]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:25:40.028 --> 01:25:50.915]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.481]  It's not about left or right.
[01:25:54.882 --> 01:25:56.283]  It's about a one world government.
[01:25:56.744 --> 01:26:03.070]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.061]  The Obama Deception.
[01:26:13.481 --> 01:26:14.683]  The people strike back.
[01:26:16.777 --> 01:26:17.617]  We're good to go.
[01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:38.910]  I think so.
[01:27:02.361 --> 01:27:02.641]  I think so.
[01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:34.216]  Alright, coming up next hour, and I'm going to open the phones up, I'm also going to get into Glenn Beck debunking the FEMA camps last night with a straw man attempt, so that's coming up in the final hour.
[01:27:34.236 --> 01:27:50.105]  You know, I've got XCM serious in my car, so I'm listening to the BBC and I hear Carol Dedele talking about the case of her son being brutally murdered in a way that just is hard to imagine.
[01:27:51.286 --> 01:27:53.247]  Things that just, you know, totally
[01:27:56.351 --> 01:28:02.814]  Dumbstruck the mind is the term and that no one helped her son on the bus.
[01:28:02.834 --> 01:28:03.854]  That's a whole other issue.
[01:28:03.874 --> 01:28:21.662]  And we see these cases more and more that the psychopathic demon that killed her son, you know, may get out of prison because they're saying he was criminally insane.
[01:28:22.955 --> 01:28:31.991]  That's why we've got her on, because we have similar cases here in the United States, England, all over the world, where I've seen countless cases being in New Zealand, of where they release a violent schizophrenic.
[01:28:32.967 --> 01:28:39.131]  And then they go out and kill again, or they hurt somebody, and I don't understand how this can happen.
[01:28:39.692 --> 01:28:45.416]  And so she's fighting this, and she has the website TimsLaw.ca.
[01:28:46.557 --> 01:28:49.839]  That's Tims, T-I-M-S-L-A-W dot C-A.
[01:28:50.299 --> 01:28:52.641]  But I think it's better, and I know it's hard for her to talk about, but
[01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:54.422]  Thank you very much for the opportunity.
[01:29:17.489 --> 01:29:19.210]  Where would you like to start exactly?
[01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:24.033]  Yeah, let's start at the beginning and then break down what's now happening.
[01:29:24.733 --> 01:29:25.093]  Okay.
[01:29:25.774 --> 01:29:26.714]  Um, okay.
[01:29:26.934 --> 01:29:42.583]  On July 30th of 2008, so last summer, I was, um, um, at home here and heard about a murder that took place probably about 45 minutes from my home.
[01:29:43.463 --> 01:29:46.245]  It happened on a Greyhound bus and, um,
[01:29:47.102 --> 01:29:48.683]  It was quite horrific.
[01:29:48.924 --> 01:30:00.353]  What we had heard originally, initially, was that a young man had been stabbed and decapitated on the bus.
[01:30:01.213 --> 01:30:03.896]  And we thought, oh my God, that's awful.
[01:30:04.336 --> 01:30:10.181]  And immediately, my heart went out to the family of this murdered person.
[01:30:13.772 --> 01:30:21.219]  In the summertime, I was cooking at a senior's manor, making supper for these senior citizens every evening.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:35.352]  So that day, which was a Wednesday, I went to work at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and continued to hear about this murder, but no identification yet.
[01:30:35.533 --> 01:30:36.814]  Dinner time comes around and
[01:30:37.645 --> 01:31:05.050]  We all said grace before the meal and we said a special prayer to the family of this murdered individual and we did the cleanup after that and I headed home to have dinner with my husband and that would have been about 7 o'clock in the evening on the Thursday and we had just finished having our dinner and the phone rang and it was my ex-husband
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:11.481]  And he asked me if I had heard the news on TV, and I said, well, of course I've heard it.
[01:31:11.521 --> 01:31:13.221]  I mean, everybody had heard it.
[01:31:13.241 --> 01:31:18.882]  It's a completely unusual thing to occur anywhere around here.
[01:31:18.902 --> 01:31:23.103]  And then he told me it was our son.
[01:31:24.083 --> 01:31:25.504]  And I hit the floor.
[01:31:26.424 --> 01:31:32.185]  My husband came over and helped me get back to my feet.
[01:31:32.265 --> 01:31:33.185]  I couldn't breathe.
[01:31:34.011 --> 01:31:35.853]  I felt like I was going to vomit.
[01:31:36.273 --> 01:31:39.196]  I ran out our front door and just screamed no.
[01:31:39.216 --> 01:31:45.642]  I couldn't comprehend that this had actually happened and it was my child that it happened to.
[01:31:45.662 --> 01:31:51.367]  He was working with a carnival affair during the summer months.
[01:31:51.407 --> 01:31:54.349]  He had gone out west two provinces over from the one.
[01:31:54.389 --> 01:31:55.330]  We live in Manitoba.
[01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:58.273]  He was working in Alberta.
[01:31:59.403 --> 01:32:04.126]  Trying to get together some money to get his own place and get a car and stuff when he came back.
[01:32:05.727 --> 01:32:11.591]  And, uh, he was in the last hour of about a 22 hour journey on the bus.
[01:32:12.291 --> 01:32:18.596]  And this, uh, the individual who killed him had only been on the bus for about an hour, I believe.
[01:32:19.436 --> 01:32:28.322]  And, um, I, my son's only mistake, because this, let me, let me, um, uh, make it very clear here.
[01:32:28.786 --> 01:32:31.887]  This was an entirely unprovoked attack.
[01:32:32.387 --> 01:32:37.869]  My son was sleeping by the window seat with headphones on listening to music.
[01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:40.991]  And he was stabbed out of nowhere.
[01:32:42.111 --> 01:32:46.793]  His mistake was at a smoke break a little bit earlier in the journey.
[01:32:49.554 --> 01:32:52.435]  He smiled an acknowledgement to this.
[01:32:53.355 --> 01:32:55.176]  The murderer's name was Vince Lee.
[01:32:56.366 --> 01:33:02.649]  And just as another human being, he just sort of gave him a nod and a smile, kind of like, you know, how's it going or whatever.
[01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:05.390]  And that was it.
[01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:11.092]  Mr. Lee at the beginning was sitting at the very front of the bus or near the front of the bus.
[01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:15.814]  And my son was sitting at the very back of the bus, the last row just in front of the washroom.
[01:33:16.894 --> 01:33:24.898]  And when they stopped for the smoke break, Mr. Lee took that smile and nod as an invitation at some point to go and sit with him.
[01:33:24.938 --> 01:33:25.698]  So he changed seats.
[01:33:27.006 --> 01:33:30.327]  And then about 20 minutes later, attacked him out of nowhere.
[01:33:48.152 --> 01:33:50.213]  They're inherently evil people.
[01:33:50.233 --> 01:33:51.894]  They call it psychological or mental.
[01:33:52.234 --> 01:33:53.214]  Whatever, they're a demon.
[01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:54.595]  I agree.
[01:33:55.395 --> 01:33:56.255]  And that's the end of it.
[01:33:56.676 --> 01:33:57.536]  But please continue.
[01:33:59.517 --> 01:34:01.017]  My son had no escape route.
[01:34:01.498 --> 01:34:04.499]  He was in a window seat at the very, very back of the bus.
[01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.259]  Mr. Lee was blocking the aisle.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:12.522]  But when he was initially attacked, he was stabbed in the neck and the upper chest.
[01:34:13.062 --> 01:34:16.224]  And I guess just the adrenaline from that first one or two
[01:34:17.708 --> 01:34:19.269]  We're good to go.
[01:34:46.795 --> 01:34:49.441]  All they heard was that there was a fight at the back of the bus.
[01:34:49.481 --> 01:34:52.327]  They had no idea that there was any kind of a weapon involved.
[01:34:53.148 --> 01:34:58.199]  The, um, individual's probably very close to where this attack was occurring.
[01:34:58.863 --> 01:35:03.705]  would have seen the weapon and they would have been trying to get women and children and everybody else off the bus.
[01:35:03.725 --> 01:35:05.886]  Yeah, this caught everyone unaware as I understand that.
[01:35:05.906 --> 01:35:15.471]  I mean I'm just, still you see the stories about a raped woman lying in the street in one case Canada for four hours bleeding and then you know later dying or I mean I'm not saying I'm some hero.
[01:35:15.551 --> 01:35:18.252]  One time I walk out of the bathroom, this woman's been choking for two minutes.
[01:35:18.492 --> 01:35:21.473]  They're saying dial 911 and I had to push people aside.
[01:35:21.834 --> 01:35:23.754]  They got angry, I did the Heimlich and saved her.
[01:35:23.774 --> 01:35:26.496]  You know it's because I was supposed to, you're supposed to sit there now
[01:35:27.336 --> 01:35:32.297]  My whole issue is, but I mean regardless, I think in the past we've become pretty domesticated.
[01:35:32.697 --> 01:35:39.699]  I would guess in the past on a bus partially full somebody would have, may not have saved your son, but this guy wouldn't have been able to go on as long as he did.
[01:35:39.759 --> 01:35:44.300]  And unfortunately, I think folks need to hear, just understand his mind exactly what happened next.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.421]  Well, yeah, I don't know.
[01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:50.101]  I don't know what would have happened if anybody had intervened.
[01:35:50.141 --> 01:35:53.222]  Perhaps there would have been a lot more people that were killed too.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:36:01.346]  And in that way, Timothy's being hailed as a hero because he did allow everybody else the time and opportunity to exit the bus.
[01:36:01.446 --> 01:36:14.756]  But from that initial couple of stab wounds, it happened very quickly because Lee was focused on destroying my son.
[01:36:15.456 --> 01:36:20.300]  He proceeded to decapitate him and
[01:36:22.628 --> 01:36:26.109]  Continued his rampage for five hours.
[01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:28.730]  Almost five hours.
[01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:32.091]  I believe it was four hours and 48 minutes in total.
[01:36:32.771 --> 01:36:34.952]  All of the other passengers are now off of the bus.
[01:36:36.233 --> 01:36:45.956]  There was a second bus following and that bus pulled over to offer assistance as well as a long distance truck driver.
[01:36:46.716 --> 01:36:51.258]  They barricaded the door shut to keep Mr. Lee on there.
[01:36:51.298 --> 01:36:51.598]  The RCMP
[01:36:52.611 --> 01:36:54.011]  We're good to go.
[01:36:54.031 --> 01:36:56.572]  We're good to go.
[01:37:21.897 --> 01:37:23.358]  In a baggie in his pocket.
[01:37:24.818 --> 01:37:30.740]  Some internal organs were thrown onto the front dash of the bus.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.701]  He was in the process of trying to remove one of his feet.
[01:37:35.422 --> 01:37:46.645]  He cut off everything that you can think of that could be cut off and he took everything out of his body, all of his organs.
[01:37:46.865 --> 01:37:51.427]  He ate his eyes and he ate at least one third of his heart muscle.
[01:37:52.139 --> 01:37:53.500]  As well as other tissue.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:03.024]  Mr. Lee was observed during this attack cannibalizing my son and smelling and licking his fingers.
[01:38:06.325 --> 01:38:14.568]  There were body parts in bags in four to six different locations in the bus.
[01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:19.790]  My son's body itself had endured over 100 wounding sites.
[01:38:22.156 --> 01:38:23.420]  That were devastated.
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:24.884]  I mean, devastated.
[01:38:25.145 --> 01:38:29.457]  So this was a goblin-like, bloodthirsty, uh...
[01:38:30.888 --> 01:38:33.029]  Cannibal or something out of Night of the Living Dead.
[01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:36.051]  Specifically, I know you're trying to assess blame here.
[01:38:36.091 --> 01:38:38.172]  You want to stop this from happening again, and we're going to get to that.
[01:38:38.432 --> 01:38:42.615]  And I appreciate you having the strength to talk about this to educate folks so we can stop more of this from happening.
[01:38:43.355 --> 01:38:44.676]  Why four and a half hours?
[01:38:44.696 --> 01:38:48.278]  I mean, the police got there, and then they just let him run around with the body parts?
[01:38:48.318 --> 01:38:51.960]  I mean, somebody comes up to a window with me and a knife and a head in their hand.
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.240]  I don't know.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.522]  I think that would have been a justified shooting there.
[01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:58.004]  I mean, this is a dangerous psycho running around with a head in his hand.
[01:38:59.477 --> 01:39:03.118]  I would have to agree with you and I don't have the answers as to why.
[01:39:03.299 --> 01:39:15.843]  I probably will never get those answers because the trial has been done and is over and there was nobody in that courtroom speaking on behalf of my son.
[01:39:16.623 --> 01:39:28.207]  Everything here in Canada then becomes all about the victim, or pardon me, about the criminal who they are no longer identifying as a criminal.
[01:39:28.615 --> 01:39:30.616]  They're identifying him as a patient.
[01:39:32.156 --> 01:39:34.157]  He's not being held responsible.
[01:39:34.397 --> 01:39:35.517]  So the police though?
[01:39:35.637 --> 01:39:37.818]  I mean, let him run around for hours?
[01:39:38.258 --> 01:39:42.719]  Is there outside the bus while he's running around with organs and gobbling?
[01:39:43.339 --> 01:39:44.359]  That's correct.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.420]  I don't understand it myself.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.320]  I don't know.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.141]  I know that they have a preservation of life policy.
[01:39:52.142 --> 01:39:56.743]  And since there was no preserving my son's life, their next
[01:39:57.438 --> 01:40:03.703]  Well, I have real trouble with the fact that Mr. Lee was armed with a knife and a pair of scissors.
[01:40:03.723 --> 01:40:04.484]  He did not have a machine gun.
[01:40:04.544 --> 01:40:09.147]  I think had they unbarricaded the door and allowed him an exit,
[01:40:27.344 --> 01:40:29.646]  I don't know.
[01:40:29.666 --> 01:40:33.009]  So did he finally settle down after four and a half hours?
[01:40:35.631 --> 01:40:37.493]  He exited through a window.
[01:40:38.013 --> 01:40:48.322]  He literally jumped out, landed head first out of one of the windows and I believe was tasered and apprehended at that point with my son's
[01:40:49.722 --> 01:40:52.863]  Ear, nose and tongue in his pocket.
[01:40:53.584 --> 01:40:56.965]  Now specifically, then I want to get into how he's stopping from getting out of jail and others like him.
[01:40:57.985 --> 01:41:00.726]  What do we know about this, this, this creature?
[01:41:01.446 --> 01:41:01.807]  Okay.
[01:41:02.527 --> 01:41:14.491]  Um, what I've discovered is that he was diagnosed schizophrenic catatonic state in September of 2005.
[01:41:16.394 --> 01:41:18.514]  He arrived here from China in 2001.
[01:41:21.135 --> 01:41:32.937]  He was diagnosed schizophrenic in September of 05, which to me is very interesting because it is also the same year that he obtained Canadian citizenship.
[01:41:34.698 --> 01:41:41.979]  By the psychiatrist's own testimony, schizophrenia is not an overnight illness.
[01:41:42.586 --> 01:41:48.991]  It takes a long time to manifest itself, and it usually manifests itself much earlier in life.
[01:41:49.552 --> 01:41:51.753]  This is late-onset schizophrenia.
[01:41:52.214 --> 01:41:55.336]  Do we know if this was chemically induced, though, or adding to it?
[01:41:55.356 --> 01:42:00.260]  You know, a lot of times the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with these psychotic breaks.
[01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:10.068]  Well, apparently there's some law that prevents them from obtaining bodily fluids to do any of that sort of testing, because I asked that.
[01:42:10.529 --> 01:42:10.789]  To me,
[01:42:12.255 --> 01:42:20.881]  Unjustifiable, I think is what I was told, that they have to have a reasonable cause to obtain those fluids.
[01:42:20.921 --> 01:42:38.131]  And I'm thinking, you know, slaughtering an individual, slaughtering another human being on a bus is not just cause to test his blood and bodily fluids for chemicals, chemical abuse or whatever, yet they can do a breathalyzer for a drunk driver?
[01:42:39.489 --> 01:42:41.109]  None of it makes any damn sense to me.
[01:42:41.529 --> 01:42:41.869]  I agree.
[01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:47.711]  Here in Austin, they take your blood without a warrant on the side of the road with the police, and they have these rubber stamp warrants that are fake.
[01:42:49.231 --> 01:42:50.271]  Just amazing.
[01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:54.112]  I mean, I know Canada's got some weird laws, but this is crazy.
[01:42:54.872 --> 01:43:01.413]  Well, and this is why I have to work relentlessly to change them, because this is absolutely unacceptable.
[01:43:01.853 --> 01:43:06.814]  Now, to take a step back, he was diagnosed schizophrenic in Ontario.
[01:43:07.321 --> 01:43:09.983]  Which is one of the provinces right next door to Manitoba.
[01:43:11.544 --> 01:43:22.633]  He was treated in a psychiatric facility in Eboticoke, a town in Ontario.
[01:43:23.113 --> 01:43:35.002]  He was diagnosed schizophrenic there and he was there for 10 days and then he left against medical advice and chose not to take his medication.
[01:43:37.068 --> 01:43:43.950]  Oh, well that's guaranteed, because as you know, a lot of the anti-psychotic drugs, if you go off them immediately, it causes a chemical imbalance.
[01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:46.691]  Well, yeah.
[01:43:46.831 --> 01:43:48.431]  But here's my problem.
[01:43:48.931 --> 01:43:57.193]  You know, on top of all the other problems, the fact that he was able to obtain citizenship in the same year that he obtains a schizophrenic diagnosis.
[01:43:57.874 --> 01:43:59.214]  How'd that happen, for one thing?
[01:44:00.254 --> 01:44:06.416]  And then, he's diagnosed schizophrenic in Ontario, but the moment he crosses any border,
[01:44:07.301 --> 01:44:08.822]  That diagnosis disappeared.
[01:44:09.082 --> 01:44:10.102]  It does not follow him.
[01:44:12.363 --> 01:44:14.864]  So once he came into Manitoba, he had no diagnosis.
[01:44:15.424 --> 01:44:15.865]  Amazing.
[01:44:15.905 --> 01:44:17.525]  You know, we love Canadians.
[01:44:17.545 --> 01:44:18.766]  They're really nice, smart people.
[01:44:18.806 --> 01:44:21.727]  But every time I go to Canada, they treat us really bad at the border.
[01:44:21.747 --> 01:44:22.747]  I don't know if we do that to you.
[01:44:22.767 --> 01:44:23.808]  If it is, it's wrong.
[01:44:24.148 --> 01:44:30.811]  But then I just saw all these foreigners, you know, that is not from the U.S., just going right through customs.
[01:44:31.471 --> 01:44:34.132]  Whenever I fly in, who can't even speak English?
[01:44:34.252 --> 01:44:34.932]  Why is that?
[01:44:34.952 --> 01:44:39.073]  I mean, is Canada, like, only for people from, like, the third world?
[01:44:39.133 --> 01:44:40.354]  Is that the meaning?
[01:44:40.614 --> 01:44:41.874]  I don't have those answers.
[01:44:42.014 --> 01:44:44.555]  I wouldn't even begin to guess at them.
[01:44:44.755 --> 01:44:50.597]  But the fact that that diagnosis doesn't follow is a very key point.
[01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:56.579]  The fact that it was a diagnosis that was made in the same year that he obtained citizenship is another key point.
[01:44:57.361 --> 01:45:00.362]  Okay, Carol Dodele, we've got a break.
[01:45:00.402 --> 01:45:01.263]  We're going to come back.
[01:45:01.563 --> 01:45:14.248]  Let's talk about the website so people can get involved at TimsLaw.ca and stop these vicious killers from getting out of jail.
[01:45:16.909 --> 01:45:22.371]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:45:22.411 --> 01:45:22.932]  and the world.
[01:45:23.212 --> 01:45:26.653]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:45:27.073 --> 01:45:33.296]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:45:33.576 --> 01:45:35.357]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:45:35.597 --> 01:45:43.540]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.242]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:45:48.522 --> 01:45:54.044]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:45:54.324 --> 01:45:56.324]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:45:56.505 --> 01:45:59.886]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[01:46:00.186 --> 01:46:02.307]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:21.592]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:46:22.092 --> 01:46:29.074]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:46:29.671 --> 01:46:35.898]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:46:36.258 --> 01:46:38.100]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.662]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:46:40.743 --> 01:46:51.534]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:46:52.302 --> 01:46:53.583]  It's not about left or right.
[01:46:53.963 --> 01:46:55.384]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:46:55.824 --> 01:47:02.167]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:12.152]  The Obama Deception.
[01:47:12.572 --> 01:47:13.773]  The people strike back.
[01:47:15.686 --> 01:47:18.327]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:47:18.907 --> 01:47:21.869]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:25.650]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:32.213]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:47:32.593 --> 01:47:37.655]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:47:37.815 --> 01:47:44.518]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:47:44.838 --> 01:47:45.719]  Need something more?
[01:47:45.919 --> 01:47:49.582]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[01:48:05.815 --> 01:48:06.115]  Or call 1-800-313-6400.
[01:48:06.135 --> 01:48:06.475]  That's 1-800-313-6400.

[01:48:07.996 --> 01:48:09.416]  Well, her son Tim was brutally murdered.
[01:48:09.596 --> 01:48:10.737]  That's why she has TimsLaw.ca.
[01:48:10.757 --> 01:48:13.197]  Because they let these violent killers out all the time.
[01:48:33.166 --> 01:48:35.428]  And they commit the crimes again and again.
[01:48:36.569 --> 01:48:38.051]  Same thing with these child molesters.
[01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:41.094]  Just amazing.
[01:48:41.954 --> 01:48:45.218]  Okay, going back to his mother, Carol Dedele.
[01:48:45.818 --> 01:48:55.027]  Carol, okay, so they have this little kangaroo trial where you weren't even allowed to have any input, and now they can let him go from his facility.
[01:48:56.001 --> 01:48:56.601]  This is true.
[01:48:56.661 --> 01:49:00.484]  And you had mentioned before that he could be released from prison.
[01:49:00.524 --> 01:49:01.705]  Well, let me make it clear.
[01:49:01.765 --> 01:49:03.446]  He's not in a prison right now.
[01:49:03.846 --> 01:49:08.910]  He is in a mental hospital where he is a patient.
[01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:10.691]  He is not a criminal.
[01:49:10.791 --> 01:49:19.237]  He is a patient now in Canada with an NCR verdict, which stands for not criminally responsible.
[01:49:20.818 --> 01:49:24.741]  Coincidentally, that also means no criminal record.
[01:49:25.615 --> 01:49:40.167]  Because if and when he is ever let loose, like so many of them are, and what's scary is they're usually out in one to three years, one to five almost certainly, and that when he is released he will not even have a record for having committed this crime.
[01:49:40.687 --> 01:49:44.330]  If I shoplifted a lipstick at Walmart, I would have a criminal record.
[01:49:45.191 --> 01:49:48.674]  He's done this to my child and he will have no record of having committed that crime.
[01:49:51.024 --> 01:49:51.864]  Just amazing.
[01:49:51.964 --> 01:49:52.925]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:49:53.485 --> 01:49:55.486]  So how do we stop him and others from getting out?
[01:49:55.506 --> 01:50:02.349]  And you might get into all the cases you're being contacted about dealing with how other violent people like this get out.
[01:50:03.009 --> 01:50:17.755]  Well, that's what's really disturbing is because now in the Canadian way of doing things, these types of individuals are pulled out of the criminal justice system and handed over to doctors where they are reviewed yearly.
[01:50:18.766 --> 01:50:30.335]  And myself and my family will have to go before this review board on a yearly basis in order to keep him there, or to try to keep him there, to have any input into it.
[01:50:31.236 --> 01:50:33.657]  And at that, they don't have to listen to anything that we have to say.
[01:50:33.697 --> 01:50:38.821]  But if we don't go to those review board hearings, I don't think they'd keep him very long at all.
[01:50:40.663 --> 01:50:45.546]  So the responsibility of keeping the rest of society safe gets put on our shoulders.
[01:50:46.487 --> 01:50:47.608]  And I think that's wrong.
[01:50:48.865 --> 01:50:54.750]  To be found not criminally responsible and then to have no criminal record for having done something like this is absolutely absurd.
[01:50:56.071 --> 01:50:58.453]  Well, shouldn't a jury decide this?
[01:50:58.533 --> 01:51:02.136]  Because that's how our system of Magna Carta and common law... There was no jury.
[01:51:02.416 --> 01:51:03.057]  No, I understand.
[01:51:03.297 --> 01:51:10.442]  It's the psychiatrists in the state are gods, and then we have all these cases where they let these guys go and they kill again.
[01:51:10.943 --> 01:51:17.468]  Well, I think that if they let them go, if they release them, they should have to go and live with them for a while.
[01:51:18.587 --> 01:51:23.889]  Maybe they wouldn't be so inclined to let them loose.
[01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:28.431]  Sure, you've got the state and the psychiatrist playing God, so who will decide if he's released or not?
[01:51:28.471 --> 01:51:29.132]  The medical board?
[01:51:30.192 --> 01:51:35.614]  It's a review board that consists of lawyers, psychiatrists, and a layperson.
[01:51:36.935 --> 01:51:41.277]  And I guess here's my problem in a nutshell, and this is what I need to change.
[01:51:43.518 --> 01:51:48.080]  The system says, okay, the psychiatric
[01:51:49.087 --> 01:51:50.268]  We're good to go.
[01:52:13.191 --> 01:52:19.095]  The responsibility of that is given to this very disturbed individual when they're not in a position to make those choices.
[01:52:19.575 --> 01:52:20.156]  Exactly.
[01:52:20.436 --> 01:52:21.957]  But they're responsible for themselves.
[01:52:22.497 --> 01:52:28.862]  Until they fail to comply, they do something this heinous, and then they're trying to tell us that they're not responsible.
[01:52:29.882 --> 01:52:31.483]  How do you get to have that both ways?
[01:52:31.643 --> 01:52:33.425]  And who knows if the meds are even going to work.
[01:52:33.565 --> 01:52:34.125]  One minute break.
[01:52:34.145 --> 01:52:39.549]  Let's do five more minutes if you can, Carol, because I want to specifically talk about how he stopped us, how we changed the laws.
[01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:45.611]  And the same thing goes on here to a different extent, but similar.
[01:52:46.471 --> 01:52:53.393]  Because I see the cases in the news all the time where they let these psychos and schizophrenics out of jail and they go to town on people.
[01:52:53.874 --> 01:52:54.554]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:57.575 --> 01:52:58.975]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:52:59.035 --> 01:53:02.277]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:53:06.155 --> 01:53:07.717]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:07.837 --> 01:53:12.464]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:53:12.584 --> 01:53:15.348]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:53:15.548 --> 01:53:18.412]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:53:18.592 --> 01:53:23.319]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:53:23.519 --> 01:53:24.460]  If you simply prepare.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.643]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:53:27.903 --> 01:53:34.809]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:53:34.889 --> 01:53:38.012]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:53:38.172 --> 01:53:38.433]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:53:38.453 --> 01:53:40.054]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:49.382]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[01:53:53.346 --> 01:53:54.827]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:53:54.867 --> 01:53:55.287]  Take action today.
[01:53:55.327 --> 01:53:57.109]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:54:08.917 --> 01:54:10.817]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:11.298 --> 01:54:14.238]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:17.679 --> 01:54:30.482]  Okay, we're back live, final segment with our guest.
[01:54:30.642 --> 01:54:34.163]  I'm going to get into the whole Glenn Beck situation and a lot more.
[01:54:35.703 --> 01:54:36.444]  Tim'sLaw.ca
[01:54:39.182 --> 01:54:43.067]  And, uh, his mother, someone brutally murdered by a schizophrenic.
[01:54:43.087 --> 01:54:47.954]  You know, the state says, oh, we're going to let these people go and then have them take their meds.
[01:54:47.974 --> 01:54:50.277]  You know, they're criminally insane and violent psychotics.
[01:54:51.538 --> 01:54:53.060]  Uh, but that's okay.
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.582]  We're going to let them go and give them meds.
[01:54:56.485 --> 01:54:57.885]  And so she's setting up a foundation.
[01:54:57.945 --> 01:55:00.346]  She's got TimsLaw.ca.
[01:55:00.706 --> 01:55:10.829]  So speak about that, but also you said, you know, on and off air that you're trying to warn other people to stop this carnage of allowing criminally insane people out of prison.
[01:55:10.849 --> 01:55:12.530]  I mean, regardless, they can say, well, it's not their fault.
[01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:13.510]  They're crazy.
[01:55:13.890 --> 01:55:19.231]  Still, it's the fault then if I release a tiger in a group of school children, if it eats one of the children.
[01:55:19.472 --> 01:55:24.373]  I mean, the state can't just release these people and then say, oops, when they kill again or hurt somebody.
[01:55:26.459 --> 01:55:32.142]  The whole thing is that I don't particularly, I'm not concerned with whether or not he was in his right state of mind or not.
[01:55:32.202 --> 01:55:36.844]  The fact is he still did this crime and he's not being treated as if he committed any kind of a crime.
[01:55:37.545 --> 01:55:41.447]  And it was a very, one of the most brutal, brutal, brutal murders in Canadian history.
[01:55:41.687 --> 01:55:43.408]  And nobody's being held responsible for it.
[01:55:43.988 --> 01:55:52.232]  I think Timothy's death happened this way, was as brutal as it was to bring attention to these issues.
[01:55:52.998 --> 01:55:57.281]  So that change would happen so that this doesn't continue to happen to other people.
[01:55:57.442 --> 01:55:59.343]  I don't want any other family to go through this.
[01:55:59.783 --> 01:56:08.190]  It took the police 24 hours to notify us because they could not identify my son by his body because there was next to nothing left of him.
[01:56:08.230 --> 01:56:08.831]  He was pulp.
[01:56:09.251 --> 01:56:13.134]  He had several identifying tattoos, but you couldn't tell what they were.
[01:56:13.154 --> 01:56:18.879]  He had a huge gaping wound in his chest where his heart had literally been ripped out and eaten.
[01:56:21.991 --> 01:56:30.315]  And now they can release this guy, and then somebody even gets warned about it now, and then he has no record after he's done it.
[01:56:30.775 --> 01:56:36.657]  Specifically though, you said you've got other families, because I mentioned to you the cases I've seen where they let these guys out and they kill again or harm again.
[01:56:37.137 --> 01:56:40.398]  You say you're seeing a lot of evidence of that of other people with horror stories.
[01:56:40.899 --> 01:56:41.879]  Absolutely.
[01:56:42.039 --> 01:56:50.082]  Several other families that are dealing with the fallout from an NCR verdict, not criminally responsible verdict, they're murderers.
[01:56:50.743 --> 01:56:51.043]  I don't
[01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:37.811]  I think we could all learn something from the Austrian case of Joseph Fritzl, the fellow who enslaved and raped his daughter for a 24-hour period of years, and he was sentenced to life in a psych unit for mentally deranged criminals, not patients, and public safety remains their number one priority.
[01:57:38.956 --> 01:57:40.736]  Yeah, this guy is criminally insane.
[01:57:40.756 --> 01:57:42.677]  He's not, he's not just insane.
[01:57:42.717 --> 01:57:44.257]  He's criminally insane.
[01:57:44.297 --> 01:57:47.658]  Well, I mean, look, I say execute him.
[01:57:47.758 --> 01:57:51.678]  When you clearly got the witnesses and the guy's eating people, he's a demonic creature.
[01:57:51.998 --> 01:57:52.718]  Just get rid of him.
[01:57:52.738 --> 01:57:53.619]  We shouldn't pay for him.
[01:57:54.719 --> 01:57:58.659]  Yeah, well, and Canada is the kinder, gentler nation, I suppose.
[01:57:58.879 --> 01:58:07.721]  And I don't even want to go near the death penalty conversation because I was misquoted at the beginning of all of this.
[01:58:08.516 --> 01:58:16.587]  And I think probably several people who would have otherwise been supportive chose not to be because of that even having been mentioned.
[01:58:17.182 --> 01:58:19.724]  Well, you know, that's pathetic that they can't deal with it.
[01:58:19.744 --> 01:58:22.246]  When you have a rabid dog coming down the street, you put it down.
[01:58:22.727 --> 01:58:27.992]  And the point is, that fixes the problem when you've got someone on record who's like this.
[01:58:29.373 --> 01:58:30.694]  You know, who says it's mental illness?
[01:58:30.714 --> 01:58:32.776]  This is a sickening evil person.
[01:58:32.956 --> 01:58:35.578]  You know, why do people go out and kidnap kids and torture them to death?
[01:58:35.778 --> 01:58:36.699]  It's because they like it.
[01:58:38.541 --> 01:58:43.165]  Why do we protect them and forget about the victim so quickly?
[01:58:43.567 --> 01:58:46.890]  There was nobody in that courtroom talking on behalf of my son.
[01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:50.553]  It was all about what was going to be best for Mr. Lee and how to take care of him.
[01:58:50.913 --> 01:58:59.520]  Well, Carol Dodele, you're now speaking up for him and you're a champion and you're no doubt going to save a lot of lives and I hope folks will visit the website TimsLaw.ca.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:01.161]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:59:01.181 --> 01:59:03.443]  Thank you very much for the opportunity.
[01:59:03.823 --> 01:59:05.244]  God bless you and thanks for your strength.
[01:59:05.264 --> 01:59:09.388]  We appreciate you coming on and hopefully get you back up as things develop and unfold.
[01:59:09.428 --> 01:59:09.828]  Take care.
[01:59:10.188 --> 01:59:10.789]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:17.168 --> 01:59:22.376]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[01:59:22.697 --> 01:59:24.380]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[01:59:25.722 --> 01:59:31.171]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[01:59:31.912 --> 01:59:35.314]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[01:59:35.554 --> 01:59:36.675]  We have been warned.
[01:59:36.855 --> 01:59:43.038]  And right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[01:59:43.138 --> 01:59:43.738]  Too late.
[01:59:43.858 --> 01:59:47.040]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:47.380]  Why?
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:51.302]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[01:59:51.503 --> 01:59:52.323]  Supplies are running low.
[01:59:53.047 --> 01:59:59.368]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[01:59:59.548 --> 02:00:03.209]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[02:00:03.449 --> 02:00:05.749]  Go to YourFoodStorage.com.

[02:00:09.070 --> 02:00:09.830]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:12.251]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:00:19.668 --> 02:00:21.792]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:00:22.273 --> 02:00:29.345]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:00:29.875 --> 02:00:36.058]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:00:36.438 --> 02:00:38.279]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:00:38.419 --> 02:00:40.840]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:51.865]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:00:52.506 --> 02:00:53.787]  It's not about left or right.
[02:00:54.167 --> 02:00:55.567]  It's about a one world government.
[02:00:56.028 --> 02:01:02.370]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:10.734]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:11.194 --> 02:01:12.354]  The Obama Deception.
[02:01:12.774 --> 02:01:13.975]  The people strike back.
[02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:20.229]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:01:20.489 --> 02:01:25.390]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:26.911]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:01:27.091 --> 02:01:30.571]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:01:42.214 --> 02:01:44.616]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:01:50.882 --> 02:01:51.823]  No animal testing.
[02:01:52.063 --> 02:01:53.224]  I use them and love them.
[02:01:53.405 --> 02:01:55.006]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[02:01:55.306 --> 02:01:56.387]  And I say big time.
[02:01:56.708 --> 02:01:58.209]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.549]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:02:08.178 --> 02:02:14.700]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:22.223]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:34.167 --> 02:02:35.968]  You know, I didn't want to bring this up with that lady.
[02:02:37.822 --> 02:02:40.144]  John, I sent you a clip from CNN last week.
[02:02:40.164 --> 02:02:40.845]  We never played it.
[02:02:41.646 --> 02:02:45.089]  I said, coming up, we'll show you how they're brainwashing their children, and I never did it.
[02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:48.212]  The one where the children aren't allowed to even shake hands now.
[02:02:49.293 --> 02:02:50.194]  Remember that clip, John?
[02:02:50.835 --> 02:02:52.696]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:53.077 --> 02:02:56.180]  Let's play that in a minute, because that ties into all of this.
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:58.042]  Again, I'm no hero.
[02:02:59.195 --> 02:03:17.651]  And I was at La Madeline with my wife and my newborn son, and I go to the bathroom, wash my hands, we're about to leave, I walk out and there's all these people around the table at the end of the restaurant freaking out, and this woman is eating bread and is choking and turning purple, and I walk up, and they're going, call 9-1-1, 9-1-1!
[02:03:17.771 --> 02:03:19.592]  They're all like chirping like parrots, 9-1-1, 9-1-1!
[02:03:21.601 --> 02:03:23.182]  And I started saying, hey, do the Heimlich.
[02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:24.522]  They're like, you don't know how.
[02:03:24.582 --> 02:03:24.842]  Don't.
[02:03:24.882 --> 02:03:25.442]  Get out of there.
[02:03:25.502 --> 02:03:25.662]  No.
[02:03:25.702 --> 02:03:29.283]  And I had to literally start going, OK, shoving people out of the way.
[02:03:29.684 --> 02:03:30.264]  Three deep.
[02:03:30.864 --> 02:03:31.964]  And the family's freaking out.
[02:03:32.004 --> 02:03:32.825]  Wait, are you doing that right?
[02:03:32.885 --> 02:03:34.325]  No, God.
[02:03:34.345 --> 02:03:34.625]  9-1-1.
[02:03:34.645 --> 02:03:35.225]  9-1-1.
[02:03:35.485 --> 02:03:36.626]  They just kept chanting 9-1-1.
[02:03:36.706 --> 02:03:38.486]  And I went, do the Heimlich twice.
[02:03:38.847 --> 02:03:42.968]  Big chunk of bread comes out on the table.
[02:03:44.246 --> 02:03:47.367]  And the woman, and they're like, oh, you're a hero, stay here.
[02:03:47.387 --> 02:03:49.387]  And I'm like, uh-uh, I might have hurt her or something.
[02:03:49.407 --> 02:03:49.988]  They're going to sue me.
[02:03:50.008 --> 02:03:51.068]  I'm like, just get out of here.
[02:03:51.088 --> 02:03:52.528]  Because that's how they work, folks.
[02:03:52.548 --> 02:03:54.289]  That's how the coward slaves operate.
[02:03:55.009 --> 02:04:00.511]  That's what they've turned most of the public into, unfortunately, just these gelded, afraid of everything.
[02:04:00.971 --> 02:04:01.671]  So we leave.
[02:04:03.533 --> 02:04:14.864]  I mean, that was instinctive to go to the Heimlich, you know, because I was on swim team when I was in junior high, so they put us through the YMCA slash fire department little mini course, so I knew that.
[02:04:14.884 --> 02:04:20.470]  I knew how to do it for a baby or for a big person or a little person, how to use a chair, all that stuff.
[02:04:21.471 --> 02:04:23.273]  I did the big Heimlich and just picked her up almost.
[02:04:26.614 --> 02:04:37.084]  And every day I see articles, I know that famous case where an Austin cop got run over at the corner of William Cannon and I-35 by that gas station, Tiger Mart.
[02:04:38.205 --> 02:04:47.954]  And he gets hit, he falls over laying out on the edge of the street, fire ants are all over in the summer, he lays there for like almost an hour, like 55 minutes, until the police drove by and stopped.
[02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:50.395]  See, people don't want to be bothered.
[02:04:50.595 --> 02:04:52.236]  Oh man, that's a guy hurt right there.
[02:04:52.276 --> 02:04:54.036]  I don't want to call 9-1-1.
[02:04:54.496 --> 02:04:56.257]  They'll say something to me.
[02:04:56.577 --> 02:04:57.377]  I don't want to stop.
[02:04:57.397 --> 02:05:01.338]  I don't want to... To the point that they had to pass laws around the country.
[02:05:01.358 --> 02:05:03.078]  If you see a car wreck, you got to stop.
[02:05:03.538 --> 02:05:04.758]  And you know, I still stop.
[02:05:06.939 --> 02:05:08.999]  Unless I see ten other cars ahead of me that already stopped.
[02:05:09.019 --> 02:05:11.480]  You know, I'll drive on past, but I'll make sure somebody pulled over to help.
[02:05:13.126 --> 02:05:24.970]  But at the same time, citizens will tattle on their neighbor for their dog going in their yard, or if they think their neighbor is spanking their kid, and not even hard, when it's not against the law, you know, they'll tattle, or they'll tattle their neighbor's got guns and guns aren't illegal.
[02:05:25.330 --> 02:05:28.831]  So you've got those tattletales, but they won't get involved themselves.
[02:05:28.851 --> 02:05:38.975]  They'll tattle on the neighbor or something, and I see the cases all the time where a homeless man will be stabbed three times in a major thoroughfare with hundreds of witnesses and nobody helps him.
[02:05:40.061 --> 02:06:01.516]  uh... or the case a few months ago where a uh... schizophrenic again uh... had kidnapped a child off the street and thought that the two-and-a-half-year-old had demons in him and he stopped the child's head wide open all of it and this went on for more than an hour as cars drove by and finally somebody called and the police
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:12.063]  In the fifteen minutes, didn't have a cruiser anywhere nearby, though it was, you know, outside a major city, so they sent a helicopter that landed and the cops ran up and shot the guy because he wouldn't stop stomping on the dead baby.
[02:06:14.464 --> 02:06:15.324]  I mean, I'm sorry, folks.
[02:06:15.364 --> 02:06:17.405]  I'm driving by and I see somebody stomping on a little kid.
[02:06:17.545 --> 02:06:20.006]  I'm gonna... It's not like I'm looking for a fight.
[02:06:20.046 --> 02:06:21.146]  I can't control myself.
[02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:23.647]  I'm gonna pull over and I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna go to town on them.
[02:06:26.027 --> 02:06:29.769]  And I don't understand why people don't have that instinct to fight evil, to fight corruption.
[02:06:29.789 --> 02:06:30.409]  I mean, look,
[02:06:31.377 --> 02:06:34.840]  I mean, you're trying to dehorn cattle.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:37.802]  Cattle that haven't been really domesticated, they're kind of wild on the range.
[02:06:38.262 --> 02:06:40.203]  I worked for a large animal vet off and on for several years.
[02:06:40.223 --> 02:06:42.185]  You know, they're running them into squeeze chutes.
[02:06:42.225 --> 02:06:44.386]  They will try to attack you, even though you're in there with a cattle prod.
[02:06:46.027 --> 02:06:47.188]  They'll try to protect themselves.
[02:06:47.228 --> 02:06:50.410]  They know they don't want to go on that squeeze chute and have their horns cut off with an electric dehorner.
[02:06:51.331 --> 02:06:56.355]  You know, any animal out there, even a bunny rabbit, if you try to grab it in the wild, it'll kick and bite and scratch at you.
[02:06:56.615 --> 02:06:57.135]  Not humans!
[02:06:57.175 --> 02:06:57.856]  We've been trained just to go...
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:00.201]  And just do whatever we're told.
[02:07:00.221 --> 02:07:02.203]  I mean, this is nothing unusual, folks.
[02:07:02.223 --> 02:07:05.565]  You corner me, you attack me, I see you attacking somebody else.
[02:07:07.347 --> 02:07:09.929]  That's what we're born to do, is to throw ourselves against it.
[02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:11.871]  And I don't understand people.
[02:07:13.452 --> 02:07:21.878]  So, you know, I've gone over this and gone over this before, but it's such a phenomenon of, they just, you know, now they do metal detectors when you get on buses in the U.S.
[02:07:21.959 --> 02:07:23.240]  and in Canada and a lot of places.
[02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:27.643]  You know, to make sure you don't have a knife, but you can still sneak one on, or have a gun.
[02:07:27.904 --> 02:07:33.347]  How about people be able to be armed, so when that guy does something like that, people are able to stand up to him.
[02:07:33.367 --> 02:07:34.728]  I mean, this went on for four hours.
[02:07:35.369 --> 02:07:38.271]  It's all about the bureaucracy, the job, the police stand down.
[02:07:38.291 --> 02:07:41.153]  You know, the police at Columbine, four hours, thirty minutes.
[02:07:41.713 --> 02:07:43.995]  The police in Blacksburg, over three and a half hours.
[02:07:45.055 --> 02:07:49.719]  The police didn't really stand down the other day, and you know, they had a big shootout with the guy, but
[02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:59.541]  The point is that you have this continual standing down while you wait for orders.
[02:07:59.581 --> 02:08:03.646]  The London Guardian and the London Telegraph as well had articles a few months ago
[02:08:05.563 --> 02:08:10.547]  Try emergency flight crews must file paperwork before rescue.
[02:08:10.767 --> 02:08:15.011]  And they gotta, oh there's a sailboat tumped over two miles out in the English Channel.
[02:08:15.031 --> 02:08:16.252]  They're gonna freeze to death in minutes.
[02:08:16.872 --> 02:08:19.054]  Instead of jumping on the chopper, they have to do an assessment.
[02:08:19.154 --> 02:08:20.775]  Is it a danger to the pilots?
[02:08:21.255 --> 02:08:22.737]  Is this a mission they should undertake?
[02:08:23.177 --> 02:08:23.737]  Who is it?
[02:08:24.818 --> 02:08:26.600]  What exactly is happening on the emergency?
[02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:29.122]  And if they don't have all those answers, they just don't go.
[02:08:31.442 --> 02:08:37.794]  And they're going, we're firefighters, we're Coast Guard, we're supposed to go out to what we don't know what's happening and put ourselves in danger.
[02:08:38.095 --> 02:08:39.277]  They're like, no, no, no.
[02:08:39.297 --> 02:08:40.820]  This is all a form of gelding.
[02:08:42.757 --> 02:08:45.698]  And remember about a decade ago, the Feds had a crusade.
[02:08:46.078 --> 02:08:47.639]  Dodgeball is mean.
[02:08:48.039 --> 02:08:50.559]  It makes some of the children feel like they're weak.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:54.721]  I was in P.E., you know, in the fifth and sixth grade and stuff.
[02:08:55.201 --> 02:08:58.082]  They would, everybody would beg to be in dodgeball.
[02:08:58.362 --> 02:08:59.142]  No one disliked it.
[02:08:59.162 --> 02:08:59.602]  It was fun.
[02:08:59.862 --> 02:09:03.223]  It teaches you to get hit with something and hit back and, you know, it's what mammals do.
[02:09:03.643 --> 02:09:05.484]  But see, oh no, no dodgeball.
[02:09:05.524 --> 02:09:08.125]  Then, no tag at recess.
[02:09:09.145 --> 02:09:10.106]  Then no hugging.
[02:09:10.786 --> 02:09:12.227]  First no kissing, then no hugging.
[02:09:12.487 --> 02:09:14.768]  Now no shaking hands, now no high fives.
[02:09:15.909 --> 02:09:17.930]  And then they call the police on you, if you do.
[02:09:18.871 --> 02:09:23.774]  Now, prisoners are allowed to shake hands in most, you know, up to medium security.
[02:09:24.194 --> 02:09:25.655]  Maximum, they're not supposed to touch.
[02:09:25.675 --> 02:09:29.017]  So, your schools are maximum security prisons.
[02:09:31.919 --> 02:09:35.541]  Where they're being inducted to go on Prozac and Ritalin and have a tattle on the parents.
[02:09:35.901 --> 02:09:36.862]  This is mind control.
[02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:45.054]  And then they have these police drills where they practice the kids putting their hands up and getting on the buses and learned helplessness is all this is.
[02:09:46.494 --> 02:09:54.619]  And that's why in England, you see the famous cases of somebody's raping, you know, somebody's wife and they hit him over the head with a lamp, they charge the guy that defended himself.
[02:09:55.159 --> 02:10:01.183]  Or somebody pushes somebody out a window who's being stabbed to death, the police come and say, we're charging you for pushing him through the window.
[02:10:01.423 --> 02:10:07.106]  Or you hear about the US where thieves keep falling through skylights and breaking their legs, they sue you and win!
[02:10:09.096 --> 02:10:13.320]  I mean, I'm serious, that's, I mean, Google, I don't know if you found that other one.
[02:10:19.706 --> 02:10:23.069]  Google, thief sues homeowner.
[02:10:24.130 --> 02:10:25.311]  And you'll get a whole bunch of articles.
[02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:27.312]  See, this is the system.
[02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:29.774]  It's all about binding down good people.
[02:10:29.814 --> 02:10:32.416]  It's all about criminalizing the regular public.
[02:10:32.656 --> 02:10:38.780]  Going through the body scanners and now scanning your naked body, taking your shoes off, submitting, being asked questions.
[02:10:39.561 --> 02:10:41.382]  Oh, don't worry, we don't profile, it's for everyone.
[02:10:41.782 --> 02:10:43.804]  See, this is about inducting you into slavery.
[02:10:44.124 --> 02:10:46.365]  Here's the CNN piece with the audio.
[02:10:47.866 --> 02:10:50.008]  No high fives, no touching at all.
[02:10:50.435 --> 02:10:57.119]  11-year-old Stephen Povreznik may only be in 6th grade, but he's old enough to question Milford's school policy.
[02:10:57.999 --> 02:11:04.003]  If you hug someone, it's considered horseplay, and this stuff is going to be met with severe action.
[02:11:04.323 --> 02:11:08.105]  That's what he and fellow students at East Shore Middle School say they've been told.
[02:11:08.326 --> 02:11:09.826]  His father is not happy.
[02:11:10.447 --> 02:11:17.131]  Now it's almost as if it's a sanitized school, where nobody can, you know, you have to keep your distance from everybody.
[02:11:17.331 --> 02:11:19.152]  And that's not what school's about.
[02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:28.498]  The district sent home a reminder about its no-touch policy this week after several students reportedly fought and one was badly kicked in the groin.
[02:11:28.778 --> 02:11:30.480]  The letter states... Alright, let's stop there.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:31.240]  Let's stop there.
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:31.320]  See...
[02:11:33.556 --> 02:11:36.078]  If one person's bad, you're all guilty.
[02:11:36.118 --> 02:11:37.679]  That's how re-education camps work.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:40.762]  Oh, Bob didn't accept that Stalin is God.
[02:11:41.562 --> 02:11:46.026]  You're all going to get your food cut in half and have to do double duty out there at the rock pile.
[02:11:46.366 --> 02:11:50.469]  And then everybody goes and beats up, you know, the guy that didn't worship Stalin as God.
[02:11:51.930 --> 02:11:54.292]  That's how this re-education mind control works.
[02:11:54.432 --> 02:11:57.495]  Oh, we had somebody kick him the groin as if kids don't do that.
[02:11:57.815 --> 02:11:59.316]  Now all of you are prisoners.
[02:11:59.536 --> 02:12:00.277]  All of you are bad.
[02:12:01.616 --> 02:12:03.197]  The feds are writing all this criteria.
[02:12:03.518 --> 02:12:04.098]  So here you go.
[02:12:04.118 --> 02:12:04.539]  Go back to it.
[02:12:05.159 --> 02:12:08.182]  The letter states physical contact is prohibited.
[02:12:08.843 --> 02:12:10.824]  Are some teachers letting you do the high five?
[02:12:11.345 --> 02:12:15.989]  No, like some kids get away with it, but others they get in trouble.
[02:12:16.009 --> 02:12:17.831]  They're going to play games.
[02:12:17.871 --> 02:12:19.813]  And what if they're out on the playground like recess?
[02:12:19.873 --> 02:12:20.213]  Okay.
[02:12:20.433 --> 02:12:21.314]  What about gym class?
[02:12:21.915 --> 02:12:22.155]  You know,
[02:12:23.128 --> 02:12:24.390]  You know, gym class is physical.
[02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:30.316]  Well, I think zero contact is pretty unrealistic because kids will be kids and they're going to touch each other.
[02:12:30.356 --> 02:12:33.679]  They're going to even roughhouse or whatever.
[02:12:34.139 --> 02:12:35.561]  That's the whole point, Dad.
[02:12:35.661 --> 02:12:37.162]  They want to get your kids in the system.
[02:12:37.663 --> 02:12:40.526]  In Austin, they arrest kids every day for being late to class three times.
[02:12:40.766 --> 02:12:41.907]  Doesn't violate state law.
[02:12:42.207 --> 02:12:43.569]  It doesn't constitute a truancy.
[02:12:44.029 --> 02:12:46.492]  Fourteen truancies in a semester is truancy.
[02:12:46.932 --> 02:12:50.533]  But they misapply it, threaten the parents, and they sign their kids over to probation.
[02:12:50.793 --> 02:12:52.594]  It's a criminal, dirtbag government.
[02:12:52.614 --> 02:13:00.876]  All over the country they've caught judges falsely putting kids in jail for six months a year to get millions of dollars of kickbacks from the private prisons.
[02:13:01.336 --> 02:13:04.177]  It's a criminal government that ships in the narcotics.
[02:13:04.417 --> 02:13:06.137]  Did you hear Lou Dobbs admit it earlier?
[02:13:08.738 --> 02:13:09.518]  Play a little bit more of it.
[02:13:09.538 --> 02:13:11.339]  I'm going to come back and get into Glenn Beckett and your phone calls.
[02:13:11.359 --> 02:13:11.599]  Here we go.
[02:13:12.597 --> 02:13:16.101]  Even rough house or whatever but you got to keep it in line.
[02:13:16.362 --> 02:13:27.035]  It kind of like puts us down because if we do good on a test or if we just like happy to see like our friends we can't give them high fives and like get in trouble for it.
[02:13:30.014 --> 02:13:31.635]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:31.675 --> 02:13:36.177]  I mean, if that isn't 1984, the kids were allowed to shake hands in the government training camp.
[02:13:36.197 --> 02:13:38.478]  See, this is mind control.
[02:13:38.558 --> 02:13:40.039]  This is zero tolerance.
[02:13:40.099 --> 02:13:41.540]  This is, we're on your back.
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:47.963]  And it doesn't matter if right here in Austin the judges get kickbacks and they build giant prisons for the kids that haven't committed crimes.
[02:13:47.983 --> 02:13:48.524]  They don't care!
[02:13:49.384 --> 02:13:50.165]  They're going to keep doing it.
[02:13:50.185 --> 02:13:51.345]  They're going to take your bank account.
[02:13:51.826 --> 02:13:54.027]  They've already stolen the GDP in six months.
[02:13:54.527 --> 02:13:55.468]  They're going to steal more.
[02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:58.750]  And they got troops illegally running checkpoints nationwide.
[02:13:58.930 --> 02:14:00.471]  And the governor says, don't do it in Tennessee.
[02:14:00.491 --> 02:14:01.531]  And the troops say, you know what?
[02:14:01.852 --> 02:14:02.432]  We're going to do it.
[02:14:02.772 --> 02:14:03.192]  Shut up!
[02:14:03.232 --> 02:14:04.053]  We got the weapons.
[02:14:04.253 --> 02:14:05.334]  We work for Madoff.
[02:14:05.814 --> 02:14:06.414]  Shut up!
[02:14:06.655 --> 02:14:07.775]  We run America now.
[02:14:07.835 --> 02:14:08.816]  We're taking your money.
[02:14:09.036 --> 02:14:09.596]  You like it?
[02:14:09.776 --> 02:14:10.277]  You like it?
[02:14:16.258 --> 02:14:17.658]  So you want to stop smoking?
[02:14:17.718 --> 02:14:18.819]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[02:14:18.999 --> 02:14:21.759]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[02:14:21.879 --> 02:14:25.700]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:29.401]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[02:14:29.641 --> 02:14:31.581]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[02:14:31.641 --> 02:14:35.582]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[02:14:35.942 --> 02:14:38.742]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.

[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.301]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:27.903]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:15:28.424 --> 02:15:34.626]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:15:34.926 --> 02:15:36.747]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:15:36.907 --> 02:15:39.288]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:15:39.368 --> 02:15:50.173]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:15:52.555 --> 02:15:53.816]  It's not about left or right.
[02:15:54.216 --> 02:15:55.617]  It's about a one world government.
[02:15:56.078 --> 02:16:02.422]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:16:02.983 --> 02:16:10.768]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:16:11.249 --> 02:16:12.410]  The Obama Deception.
[02:16:12.810 --> 02:16:14.011]  The people strike back.
[02:16:15.603 --> 02:16:21.828]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:16:22.288 --> 02:16:30.054]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:16:30.394 --> 02:16:38.280]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:43.324]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:16:43.644 --> 02:16:48.367]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:52.730]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:54.230]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:16:54.311 --> 02:16:58.393]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:16:58.813 --> 02:17:00.194]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:17:03.696 --> 02:17:06.257]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:17:06.697 --> 02:17:08.817]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:17:08.957 --> 02:17:12.078]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:17:12.198 --> 02:17:21.600]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:22.540]  It's true.
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:28.062]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:17:28.462 --> 02:17:29.842]  Not if, but when.
[02:17:32.333 --> 02:17:32.653]  Let's do it!
[02:17:47.799 --> 02:17:55.083]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[02:17:55.243 --> 02:17:58.965]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[02:17:59.245 --> 02:18:01.446]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[02:18:01.686 --> 02:18:03.727]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[02:18:03.947 --> 02:18:06.268]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:18:06.528 --> 02:18:06.988]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:18:07.008 --> 02:18:07.049]  877-327-0365.
[02:18:26.642 --> 02:18:31.804]  Alright, there have been huge new developments in the Bingham shooting in New York.
[02:18:33.205 --> 02:18:37.447]  Now you notice we always reserve judgment if it's a government operation.
[02:18:39.432 --> 02:18:46.517]  Until we have time to do research and in hindsight the evidence will come out if it was a government op or an op they allowed.
[02:18:47.017 --> 02:18:48.598]  Different variants of false flag.
[02:18:49.138 --> 02:18:54.162]  We know Columbine and some of the other shootings in Colorado and Texas were staged.
[02:18:54.262 --> 02:18:57.724]  The Buford-Furrow Jewish Children's Center thing was staged.
[02:18:58.244 --> 02:18:59.125]  Go through that evidence.
[02:18:59.165 --> 02:19:00.086]  You can just Google it.
[02:19:00.106 --> 02:19:03.228]  They were all at military bases trained, mind control programs, publicly.
[02:19:03.908 --> 02:19:13.891]  Government cell phones, you know, government phone numbers, the schools being half empty standing down, 127 bombs brought into the building at Columbine, ordering the stand down.
[02:19:15.952 --> 02:19:20.973]  There's been big new developments and I already saw some of this in the news and had some tips on it.
[02:19:21.213 --> 02:19:22.333]  We have listeners everywhere.
[02:19:22.974 --> 02:19:25.134]  We have a listener, we've confirmed his name, where he works.
[02:19:25.194 --> 02:19:27.015]  He can't say where he works because of this.
[02:19:29.596 --> 02:19:30.476]  That's all I'm going to say.
[02:19:32.671 --> 02:19:34.752]  We don't let you know their police or who they are.
[02:19:36.692 --> 02:19:39.113]  But it came out in the news this morning.
[02:19:41.654 --> 02:19:42.994]  This has come up in about 15 minutes.
[02:19:43.374 --> 02:19:44.254]  I gotta do the Glenn Beck thing.
[02:19:46.075 --> 02:19:47.155]  This is huge breaking news.
[02:19:48.055 --> 02:19:56.978]  It came out that the shooter delivered a letter to the news station saying, I'm gonna go shoot people, kill people, and basically where?
[02:20:01.235 --> 02:20:03.397]  It turns out, it's just so sick.
[02:20:04.598 --> 02:20:08.141]  See, under these protocols, they gotta call the feds first to see what they're gonna do.
[02:20:09.582 --> 02:20:11.484]  So by itself, it means they stand down.
[02:20:13.846 --> 02:20:15.187]  How dumb are these government people?
[02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:23.735]  It's like the 911 caller with the guy in Pittsburgh who killed the three cops and hurt two others, critically wounded them.
[02:20:25.117 --> 02:20:29.699]  The mother says he's got guns here, he's dangerous, and the 911 lady doesn't tell the police that.
[02:20:30.179 --> 02:20:34.380]  I mean, it's just these people... I mean, is it total ineptitude, or is it an operation?
[02:20:36.301 --> 02:20:36.641]  I don't know.
[02:20:37.641 --> 02:20:46.064]  You know, if it turns out that the Pittsburgh shooter was in some weird government psychiatric facility, and then the evidence starts mounting, I mean, a lot of times this is government.
[02:20:46.484 --> 02:20:47.564]  I mean, they really do this.
[02:20:48.145 --> 02:20:51.786]  They wind up these lunatics, give them weapons, and have them do it, but I don't think that's the case with this guy.
[02:20:52.543 --> 02:20:54.345]  But with the one in New York, it's starting to look like that.
[02:20:54.665 --> 02:20:55.126]  Okay, look.
[02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:59.050]  Glenn Beck, folks, is a danger to the country.
[02:20:59.651 --> 02:21:00.692]  But he's got his free speech.
[02:21:01.393 --> 02:21:04.436]  He is a Judas Goat, he is a Benedict Arnold, he is a traitor.
[02:21:04.977 --> 02:21:09.782]  He isn't out there saying he's, you know, with the New World Order and being honest about it.
[02:21:09.822 --> 02:21:11.865]  Then you can dislike him, but respect him.
[02:21:13.291 --> 02:21:14.291]  He's doing the opposite.
[02:21:14.391 --> 02:21:18.273]  He, whenever he talks about Patriot stuff, he acts kooky and crazy to discredit it.
[02:21:19.053 --> 02:21:23.315]  Then he always tries to get our confidence, then later says a restaurant, Paul supporters, they're McVay types.
[02:21:23.915 --> 02:21:27.576]  And I know him so well that I said, you watch, he's going to debunk them.
[02:21:28.177 --> 02:21:31.018]  Then he announced last week, yes it's bull, I'm going to debunk it next week.
[02:21:31.826 --> 02:21:39.660]  And we predicted, okay, he's going to claim the train station up in Illinois, and there's another one in Indiana, these train repair shops.
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:43.126]  He's going to do the Linda Thompson deal, who we know is a disinfo operative.
[02:21:43.767 --> 02:21:45.070]  And sure enough, that's what he did.
[02:21:46.647 --> 02:21:47.408]  It's a strong man.
[02:21:47.468 --> 02:22:05.002]  You've got all these real instances of FEMA camps I covered yesterday, mainstream news, congressional testimony, you know, Houston Chronicle, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Miami Herald, all admitting it, congressmen admitting it, you know, where they're at, civilian inmate labor camp program, everything we covered yesterday.
[02:22:06.163 --> 02:22:06.723]  None of that!
[02:22:06.743 --> 02:22:08.184]  He's not going to touch that with a ten-foot pole.
[02:22:08.224 --> 02:22:09.706]  We sent this all to him weeks ago.
[02:22:10.446 --> 02:22:15.831]  You really want to know, here it is, Glenn, and I even know through contact with his producer at Fox, they don't want it.
[02:22:16.428 --> 02:22:17.509]  Thank you, we'll look at it.
[02:22:17.569 --> 02:22:17.889]  Click.
[02:22:19.651 --> 02:22:20.892]  He comes out with a straw man.
[02:22:21.213 --> 02:22:24.096]  Let's start rolling this, and it's just, it's self-explanatory.
[02:22:24.476 --> 02:22:31.283]  And he also has a thing with blood, it's Glenn Beck on the screen with blood coming out of his eyes, with smoke coming out, saying, crazy time.
[02:22:32.945 --> 02:22:37.990]  So, and then they bring in popular mechanics, the disinfo operatives, literally government run, admittedly.
[02:22:38.814 --> 02:22:39.254]  Here it is.
[02:22:39.314 --> 02:22:42.297]  A little over a month ago, I had a call.
[02:22:42.618 --> 02:22:48.083]  It was like the one billionth call from a woman who asked me about FEMA prison camps.
[02:22:48.143 --> 02:22:53.568]  And I said to my producer, I said, can we just please debunk this or prove it to be accurate?
[02:22:53.828 --> 02:22:58.552]  I kind of snapped on the lady, because honestly, I'm sick of seeing the emails about the FEMA camps.
[02:22:58.592 --> 02:23:02.976]  I got something from friends that was about Nancy Pelosi, and it was completely bogus.
[02:23:03.797 --> 02:23:05.298]  Let's just stick to the facts.
[02:23:05.338 --> 02:23:08.201]  There's enough truth out there that pisses people off.
[02:23:08.481 --> 02:23:09.922]  We don't need all the lies.
[02:23:10.622 --> 02:23:12.744]  The basic idea is that Viva is setting up.
[02:23:13.004 --> 02:23:14.425]  So he just said we don't need all the lies.
[02:23:15.626 --> 02:23:23.452]  I mean, I just, I have state reps on and the governors in the newspapers saying I see no army checkpoints and they run them all over Tennessee and it's in the newspaper.
[02:23:24.253 --> 02:23:26.895]  And I've got major publications saying I'm a liar.
[02:23:27.175 --> 02:23:29.277]  Northcom hasn't announced this and isn't doing it.
[02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:37.964]  And then, the FEMA camps are real, they're on record, and Beck's saying we're liars, and he goes and shows a straw man.
[02:23:37.984 --> 02:23:41.705]  We'll come back and finish it, and then go to this huge breaking New York news.
[02:23:43.345 --> 02:23:44.325]  I just, I can't believe it.
[02:23:44.445 --> 02:23:45.905]  I wish it was a lone shooter.
[02:23:45.925 --> 02:23:50.746]  I mean, you know how scary it is to know the government is behind this stuff, a lot of it?
[02:23:51.226 --> 02:23:52.866]  I mean, these people, there's no end to them.
[02:23:53.046 --> 02:23:54.767]  But what does Operation Northwood say?
[02:23:55.287 --> 02:24:01.288]  It says we'll commit sniper attacks in New York, and in D.C., and in Miami,
[02:24:02.307 --> 02:24:05.751]  And then we'll blame it on Patsy's mental patients.
[02:24:06.132 --> 02:24:07.033]  We're on the march.
[02:24:07.533 --> 02:24:09.115]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:24:10.056 --> 02:24:12.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:16.209 --> 02:24:22.091]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[02:24:22.391 --> 02:24:25.833]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com can help free you from the debt trap.
[02:24:26.013 --> 02:24:30.714]  This is not a debt settlement program which has tax consequences or debt consolidation.
[02:24:30.875 --> 02:24:34.376]  With our program, there are no more payments to creditors or collectors.
[02:24:34.576 --> 02:24:40.978]  We will help restore your credit history, protect your property, prevent paycheck garnishments, and preserve your bank account.
[02:24:41.078 --> 02:24:42.619]  We also provide mortgage modification
[02:24:42.619 --> 02:24:43.120]  I think so.
[02:25:06.623 --> 02:25:10.487]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:25:10.527 --> 02:25:14.951]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:25:30.012 --> 02:25:36.195]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:25:36.596 --> 02:25:38.437]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:25:38.577 --> 02:25:40.978]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:25:41.078 --> 02:25:52.044]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:53.940]  It's not about left or right.
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:55.741]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:25:56.161 --> 02:26:02.522]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:26:11.344 --> 02:26:12.485]  The Obama Deception.
[02:26:12.905 --> 02:26:14.105]  The people strike back.
[02:26:16.035 --> 02:26:17.216]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[02:26:17.396 --> 02:26:19.678]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[02:26:19.818 --> 02:26:23.821]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[02:26:23.961 --> 02:26:27.664]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct.
[02:26:27.744 --> 02:26:36.210]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods direct.
[02:26:36.310 --> 02:26:39.933]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[02:26:40.153 --> 02:26:44.777]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime,
[02:26:50.776 --> 02:26:51.196]  I think so.
[02:27:19.164 --> 02:27:22.606]  Yeah, Glenn Beck did a bad, bad thing, ladies and gentlemen, did a bad, bad thing.
[02:27:22.686 --> 02:27:26.408]  He claimed he was a patriot, and I told you he was a government operative.
[02:27:28.329 --> 02:27:30.170]  And some of you did a bad, bad thing.
[02:27:31.691 --> 02:27:37.494]  You decided that, oh, I got your emails, Alex, come on, Glenn's really woken up.
[02:27:37.854 --> 02:27:39.215]  Are you jealous of him?
[02:27:40.255 --> 02:27:41.736]  This is about survival, folks.
[02:27:43.837 --> 02:27:44.857]  I'm a very humble person.
[02:27:44.877 --> 02:27:46.158]  This whole planet's small.
[02:27:46.198 --> 02:27:48.938]  This galaxy's tiny compared to what's around us.
[02:27:49.319 --> 02:27:52.639]  I don't care about Glenn Beck and his little monkeyness up on TV.
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:59.701]  I'm angry at him because he's a betrayer and a liar and I knew he was going to come out and stab us in the back and say FEMA camps weren't real.
[02:27:59.921 --> 02:28:05.243]  And I was right and I pegged exactly what he was going to air and what he was going to do on record weeks ago.
[02:28:08.058 --> 02:28:08.458]  Okay?
[02:28:09.338 --> 02:28:14.159]  And he's having nine, twelve meetings everywhere, brainwashing everybody, and he always does this.
[02:28:14.340 --> 02:28:16.440]  The new order's real, it's North Korea, it's China.
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:21.141]  At the end of his program he goes, this is a real concentration camp, and I'm gonna tell you tomorrow what it is.
[02:28:21.901 --> 02:28:22.582]  It's North Korea.
[02:28:22.902 --> 02:28:23.782]  It's a North Korean camp.
[02:28:24.422 --> 02:28:28.123]  What he doesn't tell you is that Donald Rumsfeld and ABB helped prop them up.
[02:28:29.103 --> 02:28:30.603]  So see, it's always about the outsider.
[02:28:30.643 --> 02:28:31.644]  They're bad over here.
[02:28:31.704 --> 02:28:32.924]  We don't have camps here.
[02:28:33.204 --> 02:28:34.084]  We're the good guys.
[02:28:34.464 --> 02:28:36.065]  Anyways, let's play some of the hit piece.
[02:28:36.145 --> 02:28:36.505]  It's just...
[02:28:37.529 --> 02:28:38.609]  It just speaks for itself.
[02:28:38.689 --> 02:28:40.030]  It's just absolute bull.
[02:28:40.090 --> 02:28:40.470]  Here we go.
[02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:43.410]  Concentration camps to be used against U.S.
[02:28:43.470 --> 02:28:43.971]  citizens.
[02:28:44.731 --> 02:28:53.533]  Now, along with the 9-11 truthers, this is one of the most pervasive conspiracy theories on the internet because it comes with supposed video proof.
[02:28:54.113 --> 02:28:55.613]  Notice how he does guilt by association.
[02:28:55.813 --> 02:29:00.094]  They're going to show you fake FEMA camp put out by the government disinfo operative in the 95.
[02:29:00.174 --> 02:29:02.715]  Linda Thompson.
[02:29:04.471 --> 02:29:11.518]  And then they're going to tie it in with 9-11 truth, like, oh, this has been discredited, and so has that, and everybody knows 9-11's discredited.
[02:29:11.758 --> 02:29:12.799]  He says that coming up later.
[02:29:12.839 --> 02:29:14.301]  Just all mass mind things.
[02:29:14.541 --> 02:29:16.142]  Everybody knows there's not a new world order.
[02:29:16.543 --> 02:29:18.104]  Everybody knows the government loves you.
[02:29:18.144 --> 02:29:18.525]  Here we go.
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:24.923]  That video now has had well over a million views on YouTube, so we set out to get the truth.
[02:29:25.023 --> 02:29:29.425]  And quite honestly, I don't believe that there are FEMA concentration camps.
[02:29:29.505 --> 02:29:30.746]  I think that sounds kind of nuts.
[02:29:31.186 --> 02:29:34.608]  But, if there are, I'll show them to you.
[02:29:35.128 --> 02:29:37.630]  If there aren't, I'll show that to you.
[02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:40.972]  We set out to get the truth on it, and after our initial research,
[02:29:41.892 --> 02:29:43.955]  I came in and I said, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:29:43.995 --> 02:29:45.216]  We can't debunk this?
[02:29:45.516 --> 02:29:45.937]  Well, no.
[02:29:46.317 --> 02:29:48.860]  I thought we had done enough research to get the video.
[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:50.782]  I wanted to line up videos side by side.
[02:29:50.802 --> 02:29:56.288]  Apparently, there hadn't been any debunking done at all, and there was no video side by side.
[02:29:56.749 --> 02:30:05.294]  Well, predictably, the media started claiming that somehow or another I believe in these conspiracy theories, even though I said on the air a million times I don't, and I've said that for years.
[02:30:06.054 --> 02:30:13.718]  Not to mention, the entire time they were running their mouths, we were working with an independent group to debunk them, or to prove them.
[02:30:14.278 --> 02:30:16.840]  I also said that on the air over and over and over again.
[02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:18.841]  But who listens to context?
[02:30:20.256 --> 02:30:21.077]  Oh, he makes me sick.
[02:30:21.597 --> 02:30:24.180]  Anyways, let's mean to women.
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:24.840]  He's not effeminate.
[02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:31.727]  He's got the male fake effeminate little act with his little date for the day, Megs, there on the show.
[02:30:31.827 --> 02:30:34.609]  Now, these guys really make me sick.
[02:30:36.651 --> 02:30:40.214]  Again, I really just wanted to tell the truth, and now I got called a kook.
[02:30:40.294 --> 02:30:44.338]  All I was doing was investigating, and I debunked them.
[02:30:44.358 --> 02:30:46.000]  See, he plays both sides of the fence here.
[02:30:47.273 --> 02:30:48.253]  Just keep playing it.
[02:30:48.593 --> 02:30:49.134]  Oh, God.
[02:30:49.434 --> 02:30:50.474]  Keep playing him.
[02:30:50.894 --> 02:30:53.515]  They can actually set the record straight here is James Meggs.
[02:30:53.775 --> 02:30:58.616]  He's the editor-in-chief of that independent group I was talking about, otherwise known as Popular Mechanics.
[02:30:58.636 --> 02:31:00.417]  Look what he puts on screen!
[02:31:00.457 --> 02:31:03.618]  Edge of insanity with blood pouring out of the eyes.
[02:31:03.698 --> 02:31:07.359]  Everybody knows now it's not true because of Popular Mechanics except Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:31:08.039 --> 02:31:10.280]  James is here now to do the same with the FEMA camps.
[02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:13.262]  Okay, let's just start with the easy stuff here.
[02:31:13.842 --> 02:31:27.590]  There is, there are, and I just want to collapse this as quickly as possible, there are things that, yes, FEMA has a right to have camps and they could do things to help people, and if you wanted to go down the crazy road of... Stop right there!
[02:31:28.911 --> 02:31:30.552]  They could be turned into something bad.
[02:31:30.572 --> 02:31:31.552]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:31:32.953 --> 02:31:39.357]  I read to you all the executive orders, the FEMA documents, on record yesterday in the hour and a half plus expose we did.
[02:31:40.365 --> 02:31:43.968]  I played Senate and House on the floor.
[02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:46.230]  As they said, martial law has been threatened.
[02:31:46.270 --> 02:31:47.251]  FEMA is above us.
[02:31:47.611 --> 02:31:49.092]  Congress no longer has the authority.
[02:31:49.132 --> 02:31:50.053]  This is martial law.
[02:31:51.714 --> 02:31:54.536]  So, FEMA doesn't have the right to have these camps.
[02:31:54.556 --> 02:31:56.278]  You saw them in New Orleans taking the guns.
[02:31:58.962 --> 02:32:08.495]  I read earlier yesterday one of the former FEMA directors saying it's our job to during collapse of society to keep the alternative media from exposing what we're doing.
[02:32:08.955 --> 02:32:11.739]  They're there to make sure the bankers can rape you financially.
[02:32:12.019 --> 02:32:12.800]  Get that through your head.
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:14.643]  That's why they're running army checkpoints everywhere.
[02:32:17.978 --> 02:32:18.338]  But you know what?
[02:32:18.358 --> 02:32:19.699]  You're going to be discredited again, Beck.
[02:32:19.719 --> 02:32:22.560]  I know your job is to stall folks long enough so we don't save the country.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.360]  But, you know, there's no new world order.
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:25.120]  Now it's all admitted.
[02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:26.601]  There's no global tax, global currency.
[02:32:26.641 --> 02:32:27.261]  Now it's all admitted.
[02:32:27.621 --> 02:32:30.722]  And you keep denying all this FEMA camp crap when it's in the news.
[02:32:30.782 --> 02:32:32.923]  Oh, they're building FEMA camps for the homeless.
[02:32:33.163 --> 02:32:34.383]  But you've got to go to them.
[02:32:34.403 --> 02:32:35.804]  You're not allowed to be homeless.
[02:32:36.304 --> 02:32:38.245]  We send cameras out to where it's happening.
[02:32:40.305 --> 02:32:42.066]  But, see, you can't counter us in our facts.
[02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:43.887]  You've got to make this stuff up.
[02:32:43.927 --> 02:32:44.687]  Just go back to it.
[02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:45.880]  Yes.
[02:32:46.300 --> 02:32:50.141]  FEMA has a right to have camps and they could do things to help people.
[02:32:50.401 --> 02:32:56.063]  And if you wanted to go down the crazy road of, but they could be turned into, they actually could be.
[02:32:56.463 --> 02:32:58.784]  But there's like a million other steps that have to happen.
[02:32:59.024 --> 02:33:00.024]  Which of all that's correct.
[02:33:00.064 --> 02:33:02.625]  And what we did was we looked into these claims.
[02:33:02.845 --> 02:33:07.666]  You know, you can't go and visit every one of the 600 sites that some of these conspiracy theorists claim.
[02:33:08.126 --> 02:33:10.767]  So we started looking at the ones that are most popular on the internet.
[02:33:11.067 --> 02:33:13.148]  Okay, and let's show the video.
[02:33:13.188 --> 02:33:15.850]  First, show me the video that is on the internet.
[02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:22.154]  This is one of the so-called concentration camps, or this one's actually... Go ahead, show it.
[02:33:22.594 --> 02:33:24.235]  I guess a death camp.
[02:33:26.937 --> 02:33:27.417]  Do we have it?
[02:33:28.518 --> 02:33:29.538]  Okay, we don't have it yet.
[02:33:29.778 --> 02:33:33.541]  I can't keep going because this is kind of built around the video.
[02:33:34.641 --> 02:33:35.942]  That was the reason why we waited.
[02:33:36.462 --> 02:33:36.903]  There it is!
[02:33:38.686 --> 02:33:41.969]  This small building is the only way into a particular fenced area.
[02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:48.415]  Inside this building, we see more of the motion-activated detectors, electronic turnstiles... Okay, there's no sound?
[02:33:48.435 --> 02:33:50.076]  How come I'm hearing the sound here, Frank?
[02:33:50.917 --> 02:33:56.662]  Okay, this is something where they're showing a so-called concentration camp.
[02:33:56.702 --> 02:33:57.663]  These are turnstiles.
[02:33:58.343 --> 02:34:01.706]  This is in a secure, behind the fence.
[02:34:02.067 --> 02:34:05.229]  I don't know how they got this video when it was behind the fence, but they went in and got this video.
[02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:08.531]  You recognized this, or you searched for it, right?
[02:34:08.911 --> 02:34:09.651]  And what did you find?
[02:34:09.671 --> 02:34:11.692]  Well, it's not very hard to find, like so many of these things.
[02:34:11.732 --> 02:34:13.433]  The truth is actually fairly evident.
[02:34:13.793 --> 02:34:17.594]  This is an Amtrak repair facility in Beach Grove, Indiana.
[02:34:18.175 --> 02:34:27.318]  The woman who made this video initially claims that it's some kind of American Auschwitz, and they've outfitted buildings with gas, and they've got these strange turnstiles.
[02:34:27.698 --> 02:34:30.459]  In fact, it is a repair facility.
[02:34:31.140 --> 02:34:34.121]  We set a crew there the other day, and we got... Is this your video?
[02:34:34.161 --> 02:34:34.421]  Yes.
[02:34:34.921 --> 02:34:39.922]  So, um, initially they had some old buildings that were boarded up that have since been knocked down.
[02:34:39.942 --> 02:34:45.863]  Um, but we also went inside, um, the other buildings, and sure enough, what did we find?
[02:34:46.523 --> 02:34:48.044]  They're repairing trains in there.
[02:34:48.824 --> 02:34:49.744]  Well, trains.
[02:34:49.924 --> 02:34:51.444]  I believe Auschwitz had trains.
[02:34:51.565 --> 02:34:52.545]  I'm just saying, Jim.
[02:34:52.665 --> 02:34:58.746]  Well, once you go down that road, you can't really debunk... If somebody's convinced, wants to be convinced of that, you can't really debunk that.
[02:34:58.766 --> 02:35:00.687]  Do we have the video with audio?
[02:35:00.747 --> 02:35:02.168]  Because if we don't, I don't really care.
[02:35:02.188 --> 02:35:06.512]  The video with the audio... Okay, that's enough.
[02:35:07.012 --> 02:35:10.534]  And I know I said we'd open the phones up, but we have breaking news on the shooting from New York.
[02:35:10.615 --> 02:35:13.056]  I may get to some of the calls here that have loaded the phone lines.
[02:35:13.236 --> 02:35:15.818]  And tomorrow or someday this week, we're going to have nothing but open phones.
[02:35:15.838 --> 02:35:17.139]  There's just so much news to cover.
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:20.301]  And we do have Jim from New York on.
[02:35:20.321 --> 02:35:23.764]  We're going to go to him in just a moment with the Bemington Rampage.
[02:35:23.824 --> 02:35:24.705]  But before I do that,
[02:35:25.686 --> 02:35:46.335]  I did an hour and forty minute presentation yesterday, but if you take the breaks out, it's about an hour and twenty minute presentation, where I go through the history of the FEMA camps, the troops, the militarization of police, the government's own documents, Rocky Mountain News, you know, about mass graves and incinerators, all the rumors are over.
[02:35:46.395 --> 02:35:54.319]  You want incinerator proof, you want mass grave proof, you want internal government documents, secret documents and public documents, we got them.
[02:35:55.786 --> 02:35:56.326]  All proven.
[02:35:56.366 --> 02:35:57.986]  Incredibly important news story.
[02:35:59.807 --> 02:36:00.867]  All proven.
[02:36:01.487 --> 02:36:03.948]  And then we counter how he was going to debunk.
[02:36:04.288 --> 02:36:07.248]  This was done yesterday live, hours before his live TV show.
[02:36:07.288 --> 02:36:07.908]  We launch.
[02:36:08.909 --> 02:36:10.849]  Folks, grab it off PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:10.869 --> 02:36:13.109]  It was posted at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:36:13.509 --> 02:36:14.290]  And the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 parts.
[02:36:14.350 --> 02:36:15.110]  The 7 parts.
[02:36:21.852 --> 02:36:25.475]  Are all posted right now at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:36:25.796 --> 02:36:30.940]  The NSC military checkpoints and yes, Glenn Beck, FEMA camps are real.
[02:36:32.882 --> 02:36:36.305]  And I go into how the whole superstructure of the shadow government works from our own missions.
[02:36:37.486 --> 02:36:44.833]  That's a decent headline, but maybe we should just say, you know, the facts on FEMA camps.
[02:36:44.973 --> 02:36:45.914]  Yes, they are real.
[02:36:47.022 --> 02:36:47.743]  I don't know.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:08.563]  And you see me on here predicting the footage they would show as a straw man.
[02:37:09.123 --> 02:37:10.765]  This can really have a big effect on them.
[02:37:10.785 --> 02:37:16.029]  Also, the Missouri official who wrote the MIAC report from ADL documents has been forced to resign.
[02:37:16.069 --> 02:37:20.713]  They're talking about trying to make the governor step down or a recall of Missouri demonizing the Patriot movement.
[02:37:20.973 --> 02:37:21.734]  We're on the march.
[02:37:21.774 --> 02:37:25.858]  We're not putting up with the ADL's garbage anymore.
[02:37:26.198 --> 02:37:28.100]  We're not putting up with the
[02:37:29.878 --> 02:37:33.239]  Slander, they put out, or what the Southern Poverty Law Center is doing.
[02:37:33.619 --> 02:37:37.781]  We're not putting up with their psychological demonization and McCarthyism anymore.
[02:37:38.001 --> 02:37:38.441]  It's over.
[02:37:38.701 --> 02:37:39.761]  The gloves are off, okay?
[02:37:39.961 --> 02:37:41.242]  We're gonna expose you.
[02:37:42.202 --> 02:37:47.304]  We're not gonna do it from the pathetic, buck-toothed, white supremacist angle that's fully discredited and has no effect.
[02:37:47.324 --> 02:37:52.966]  We're gonna do it as Americans who love liberty, black, white, old, young, who want to bring down the new world order, and we're gonna do it effectively.
[02:37:53.936 --> 02:37:57.578]  And we're taking this country back, and we're going to arrest you, the bankers, for the crimes you've committed.
[02:37:57.598 --> 02:37:58.779]  You're not going to get your New World Order.
[02:37:58.959 --> 02:38:01.560]  I know the phony churches are paid off to tell Christians to stand down.
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:02.340]  It's the end of the world.
[02:38:02.641 --> 02:38:04.842]  But we see through those lies, and we're exposing that, too.
[02:38:05.362 --> 02:38:06.122]  We're on the march.
[02:38:06.543 --> 02:38:08.264]  Your empire is going straight to Hades.
[02:38:08.884 --> 02:38:15.187]  Now, that said, a lot of key stuff up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:38:15.988 --> 02:38:16.948]  I want to go to Jim.
[02:38:17.048 --> 02:38:17.749]  Not his real name.
[02:38:17.769 --> 02:38:19.850]  We're not going to say how he works or what he does.
[02:38:21.761 --> 02:38:23.463]  In a, uh, we're just going to leave it at that.
[02:38:23.503 --> 02:38:24.664]  It's, it's, it's government.
[02:38:26.246 --> 02:38:28.969]  And we've confirmed his real name and where he works and what's going on.
[02:38:28.989 --> 02:38:34.236]  Uh, dealing with the Bemington Rampage, leaving 14 dead, including the gunman.
[02:38:35.677 --> 02:38:40.142]  Turns out he'd written a letter specifically where he was going to go and who he was going to kill, you know, what he was going to do.
[02:38:41.914 --> 02:38:46.195]  And so, our witness saw what we were already hearing from others, but he's an eyewitness to this.
[02:38:47.195 --> 02:38:50.736]  Jim, from Bemington, New York, right across the street from all this happening.
[02:38:52.236 --> 02:38:53.557]  Tell us the amazing story.
[02:38:55.157 --> 02:38:56.237]  Pretty simple, really.
[02:38:56.537 --> 02:39:00.338]  I was across the street at the time the shooting occurred in Binghamton, New York.
[02:39:00.658 --> 02:39:03.399]  It was a sunny day, and there was a helicopter overhead.
[02:39:03.419 --> 02:39:07.200]  It looked like one of those helicopters that does traffic and such.
[02:39:08.565 --> 02:39:17.431]  Uh, area I was standing was in directly in front of the high school where all law abiding citizens know they're prohibited from carrying any licensed firearms.
[02:39:18.531 --> 02:39:28.417]  So when things weren't right, I could do nothing other than alert people across the street where there's a small police barracks at the high school that something wasn't right.
[02:39:28.758 --> 02:39:37.183]  And as the situation developed, multiple shots could be heard from the direction of the civic center and the local police did respond.
[02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:40.478]  But they didn't enter the building as far as I could tell.
[02:39:40.639 --> 02:39:47.848]  They set up a perimeter and within minutes they're joined by other police and soon an armored unit came with shields and such.
[02:39:47.868 --> 02:39:52.675]  Because it's all about their safety and I mean 50 years ago the cops would have just charged in and killed this guy.
[02:39:53.726 --> 02:39:57.067]  But, uh, I guess that was back when men were men, cars were cars, women were women.
[02:39:57.628 --> 02:39:59.969]  But, uh, you know, I mean, this is just amazing.
[02:40:00.349 --> 02:40:08.912]  And so to be clear, though, before you hear the shots start, you're already concerned because there's a news chopper flying around, and it turns out these guys knew where to go.
[02:40:08.972 --> 02:40:09.872]  They'd gotten the letter.
[02:40:10.333 --> 02:40:13.454]  This is outrageous, and you had to contact the police.
[02:40:15.011 --> 02:40:24.075]  The only thing I could do, my licensed firearm was home locked in a lockbox because I knew I was going to be in a firearm free zone that day.
[02:40:24.095 --> 02:40:28.537]  I feel very badly at being so helpless.
[02:40:35.205 --> 02:40:42.827]  She usually carried a firearm, but that was illegal here in Texas at the time, so she reached in and the gun wasn't there, and she just watched him blow her parents away.
[02:40:43.728 --> 02:40:44.928]  My God, the victim desire.
[02:40:44.968 --> 02:40:49.949]  Okay, so let's go to the timeline here, because we're going to write an article about this, but without saying who you are or where you work.
[02:40:51.430 --> 02:40:54.051]  Go through it step by step, every little key point.
[02:40:54.491 --> 02:40:55.651]  Describe how this starts.
[02:40:57.832 --> 02:41:04.834]  It started by a man across the street who also works for the government.
[02:41:05.464 --> 02:41:20.313]  Came across and said he saw an Asian man about five foot eight with a green jacket and sunglasses appeared to be carrying something and he was not quite sure what the something was but it frightened him terribly and he wanted police to help.
[02:41:21.474 --> 02:41:28.999]  So he went across and let people know something wasn't right and I went with him because I couldn't do anything and
[02:41:31.047 --> 02:41:31.807]  Other than alert.
[02:41:31.948 --> 02:41:42.133]  And as soon as the police heard something was going on, some went across the street and some initiated the safety protocol for the school and they did lockdown as is standard procedure.
[02:41:42.553 --> 02:41:43.754]  And they protected the children.
[02:41:43.834 --> 02:41:45.495]  My hat's off to law enforcement.
[02:41:45.515 --> 02:41:46.815]  They did a great job with that.
[02:41:49.377 --> 02:41:59.422]  And once they set up a perimeter, the health people started coming and paramedics and such, and they wouldn't let anyone into the building, you know, to help the injured.
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:05.324]  And went on for hours before they let anyone enter and help.
[02:42:05.864 --> 02:42:12.290]  And it turns out he had killed himself early on, so people bled to death as usual.
[02:42:12.770 --> 02:42:15.853]  Just like Columbine and everywhere else for many hours.
[02:42:16.293 --> 02:42:18.355]  Specifically, how many hours until they went in?
[02:42:18.415 --> 02:42:21.938]  And then specifically, you're saying the helicopter was out there first?
[02:42:23.769 --> 02:42:32.770]  That's what I remember, and it was at least an hour before any police entered the building that I saw, and three before they let healthcare people go in.
[02:42:36.215 --> 02:42:36.635]  Three!
[02:42:36.655 --> 02:42:39.577]  I mean, so they go in and they know he's dead, and then they wait two hours.
[02:42:40.297 --> 02:42:42.518]  That is an outrageous crime right there.
[02:42:42.938 --> 02:42:44.039]  And this is procedure now.
[02:42:44.059 --> 02:42:52.943]  They're filling out so much paperwork, just like the Coast Guard in England now has to fill out hours of paperwork before they go save somebody in the North Atlantic, so they die.
[02:42:54.844 --> 02:42:59.187]  Got to wait for the Feds, got to wait for procedure, got to wait for Homeland Security, got to wait to wipe our noses.
[02:43:00.028 --> 02:43:02.110]  Can you imagine the UT sniper back in the 60s?
[02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:05.372]  The cops just ran up the stairs and killed the guy.
[02:43:05.392 --> 02:43:08.615]  You know, nowadays they'd wait, and the guy would probably still be up there.
[02:43:08.635 --> 02:43:13.178]  He'd probably have a big gray beard and still be shooting up there, and they'd be sending baskets of sandwiches up to him.
[02:43:14.099 --> 02:43:15.980]  I hate to be sarcastic here, but specifically.
[02:43:16.901 --> 02:43:19.043]  I mean, go through the chronology, because this is important.
[02:43:21.935 --> 02:43:26.176]  The fella comes over and says, I'm concerned, after the helicopter, or, I mean, go to that timeline.
[02:43:26.196 --> 02:43:27.136]  This is very important.
[02:43:28.456 --> 02:43:33.257]  I noticed the helicopter over the neighborhood when I was walking across the front of the building.
[02:43:33.277 --> 02:43:36.778]  The fella came over voicing concern across the street.
[02:43:37.698 --> 02:43:41.059]  Then they notified the police that we're on site.
[02:43:41.099 --> 02:43:42.879]  They responded in under two minutes.
[02:43:42.979 --> 02:43:47.200]  They went across to the front of the building, confirmed, you know, that there were gunshots.
[02:43:48.208 --> 02:43:50.229]  You can hear multiple gunshots.
[02:43:51.049 --> 02:43:55.450]  Then they backed off and they set up a perimeter and then help came.
[02:43:55.470 --> 02:43:57.351]  Let me be clear.
[02:43:58.271 --> 02:44:01.432]  Was the helicopter out there first before you heard the gunshots start?
[02:44:02.012 --> 02:44:02.652]  I believe so.
[02:44:03.552 --> 02:44:04.153]  Oh my God.
[02:44:05.033 --> 02:44:07.234]  Might have just been flying around looking at traffic.
[02:44:07.294 --> 02:44:08.194]  Who knows what they do?
[02:44:09.266 --> 02:44:14.928]  And of course you talked to somebody who had just seen him with the what looks suspicious going in.
[02:44:14.948 --> 02:44:18.409]  So this is all happening and right then the helicopter is already there?
[02:44:18.429 --> 02:44:26.972]  It was there at least a couple of minutes before anybody... This is unbelievable.
[02:44:27.192 --> 02:44:34.335]  The news media got this letter from this guy and then it looks like waited and just let it happen.
[02:44:37.659 --> 02:44:38.840]  What do you think's going on, sir?
[02:44:39.641 --> 02:44:42.543]  I have no idea, but something's not right in the world.
[02:44:44.805 --> 02:44:45.826]  I wish I had answers.
[02:44:45.846 --> 02:44:46.747]  I'm still in shock.
[02:44:47.708 --> 02:44:49.009]  Well, it's like Columbine.
[02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:50.450]  Half the school is empty.
[02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:51.551]  Actually, more than half.
[02:44:51.831 --> 02:44:56.675]  Harrison Kleibold supposedly snuck in 120-something bombs, one of them weighing over 100 pounds.
[02:44:56.735 --> 02:44:57.876]  No one stopped him doing that.
[02:44:59.538 --> 02:45:03.961]  The principal, the deputy principal, and the sheriff were all having lunch down the street.
[02:45:06.226 --> 02:45:12.349]  The kids reported other shooters in the building and the police stood down for 4 hours 30 minutes according to the Denver Post.
[02:45:13.469 --> 02:45:14.009]  Stay there Jim.
[02:45:14.029 --> 02:45:15.790]  I want to come back with final comments from you.
[02:45:16.130 --> 02:45:19.392]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:45:19.572 --> 02:45:23.653]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:45:23.834 --> 02:45:31.797]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[02:45:32.077 --> 02:45:35.240]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:41.365]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:45:41.605 --> 02:45:45.989]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[02:45:46.289 --> 02:45:54.295]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[02:45:54.476 --> 02:46:00.981]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare
[02:46:05.325 --> 02:46:09.868]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com or call 888-213-4338 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[02:46:09.928 --> 02:46:13.650]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:46:22.643 --> 02:46:27.985]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:46:28.506 --> 02:46:34.708]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:46:34.988 --> 02:46:36.829]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:46:36.989 --> 02:46:39.370]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:46:39.450 --> 02:46:50.335]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:46:52.623 --> 02:46:53.904]  It's not about left or right.
[02:46:54.284 --> 02:46:55.684]  It's about a one world government.
[02:46:56.144 --> 02:47:02.487]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:12.470]  The Obama Deception.
[02:47:12.890 --> 02:47:14.091]  The people strike back.
[02:47:16.181 --> 02:47:19.568]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:47:19.708 --> 02:47:24.938]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:47:25.119 --> 02:47:28.065]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate.
[02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:31.390]  I think so.
[02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:04.353]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[02:48:05.254 --> 02:48:08.117]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[02:48:19.327 --> 02:48:20.348]  This is just amazing.
[02:48:20.368 --> 02:48:26.734]  You know, even if this isn't some inside job or weird stand-down order where they let the shooter go crazy, which happens more often than not,
[02:48:30.339 --> 02:48:34.577]  Well, they won't let kids high-five or play dodgeball or even shake hands anymore.
[02:48:34.778 --> 02:48:35.380]  They're prisoners.
[02:48:36.741 --> 02:48:37.742]  What do you expect to happen?
[02:48:37.762 --> 02:48:40.884]  You're going to have a nation of people that can't defend themselves, can't stand up.
[02:48:41.225 --> 02:48:43.406]  You know, you call the SWAT team to get the cat out of the tree.
[02:48:43.426 --> 02:48:45.148]  You call the SWAT team to fix the drain.
[02:48:45.708 --> 02:48:50.712]  You call the SWAT team to pretty much, you know, wipe your hind end, I guess, would be the next thing for the Queen of England here.
[02:48:51.333 --> 02:48:52.974]  I mean, you know, this is what we're becoming.
[02:48:52.994 --> 02:48:54.095]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:48:54.355 --> 02:48:56.157]  We're going to go back to Jim in just one moment.
[02:48:56.377 --> 02:48:59.319]  I want to tell you about the final sponsor of the day making this show possible.
[02:48:59.619 --> 02:49:00.620]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:49:01.741 --> 02:49:02.402]  We're good to go.
[02:49:24.182 --> 02:49:24.822]  Thank you.
[02:49:40.171 --> 02:49:43.413]  Go to Infowars.com and order the Obama Deception on DVD.
[02:49:43.473 --> 02:49:46.956]  This exposes who he works for, who the bankers are, what their plan is.
[02:49:47.076 --> 02:49:48.217]  It's now all over the news.
[02:49:48.257 --> 02:49:50.258]  And I made this film, you know, finished it a month and a half ago.
[02:49:50.839 --> 02:49:53.861]  And we announced everything that was going to happen at the G20 in the film.
[02:49:54.281 --> 02:49:56.303]  People see that and they're like, whoa, how did you know?
[02:49:56.323 --> 02:49:57.344]  Because I was reading their documents.
[02:49:57.784 --> 02:49:58.264]  It isn't hard.
[02:49:58.645 --> 02:50:00.026]  The communique was leaked months ago.
[02:50:00.666 --> 02:50:04.211]  So the issue is here, you've got to expose the criminal bankers.
[02:50:04.332 --> 02:50:07.256]  Everything else will fall on the wayside.
[02:50:07.336 --> 02:50:08.578]  It's tyrannical if you do that.
[02:50:08.678 --> 02:50:10.480]  So again, InfoWars.com.
[02:50:10.661 --> 02:50:11.882]  Okay, going back to Jim.
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.041]  Oh, by the way, don't forget, we've redesigned PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:16.761 --> 02:50:18.722]  It's now Web 2.0 and has a lot of new functions.
[02:50:18.762 --> 02:50:19.523]  Be sure and check that out.
[02:50:19.923 --> 02:50:20.743]  And keep spreading the word.
[02:50:21.463 --> 02:50:23.164]  Jim, I appreciate you contacting us.
[02:50:23.204 --> 02:50:25.925]  I appreciate you having the courage to come on and discuss this.
[02:50:26.025 --> 02:50:32.068]  Are other people around you questioning why the chopper was out there first, before the shot started, the news chopper?
[02:50:33.548 --> 02:50:42.712]  Not a lot of people know yet, because when I tried to return home, realizing I could do nothing further where I was to help, and got on the computer,
[02:50:43.624 --> 02:50:49.625]  I tried to message people and it was coming back with an email saying forbidden comment.
[02:50:50.345 --> 02:50:53.426]  You know, forbidden comment, forbidden content.
[02:50:54.626 --> 02:50:56.887]  And I couldn't get messages out.
[02:50:57.127 --> 02:51:00.128]  And I tried to text on the cell phone and I got the same thing.
[02:51:00.608 --> 02:51:04.148]  Forbidden content and it wouldn't let me reach friends and family.
[02:51:05.009 --> 02:51:06.469]  Was this over government networks?
[02:51:07.868 --> 02:51:12.771]  Uh, over the internet or regular... Well, you know, there were a lot of phone calls going on at that time.
[02:51:12.811 --> 02:51:16.693]  That routinely happens with the big disasters, the phones jam, but... but, uh, who knows?
[02:51:16.933 --> 02:51:18.554]  But what you're saying is confirmed.
[02:51:19.054 --> 02:51:27.339]  The Associated Press and others are reporting transcript of, uh, Mamington Shooter's letter that he sent to New York TV station 10.
[02:51:27.859 --> 02:51:31.542]  Was it New York station 10, or could you see which news chopper it was?
[02:51:32.582 --> 02:51:33.323]  I couldn't tell.
[02:51:33.363 --> 02:51:35.804]  It was a very sunny day, and there was a lot of glare.
[02:51:37.816 --> 02:51:40.698]  But a helicopter is unmistakably a helicopter.
[02:51:41.959 --> 02:51:49.685]  Jim Early Wong, the gunman who killed 13 people, sent himself at the American Civic Association in Binghamton.
[02:51:49.705 --> 02:51:52.928]  He says the letter was handwritten in the capital letters of two sheets of paper.
[02:51:52.948 --> 02:51:57.111]  It was postmarked Friday, April 3rd, the day of the shootings.
[02:51:58.212 --> 02:52:02.875]  And so he goes on in here to basically say he's going to go kill a bunch of people.
[02:52:02.915 --> 02:52:06.758]  He doesn't like cops and people are mean to him about not knowing English.
[02:52:07.850 --> 02:52:10.492]  And then you've got the helicopter flying around looking for the trouble.
[02:52:11.072 --> 02:52:12.813]  My God, this is just amazing.
[02:52:14.655 --> 02:52:15.575]  This is just incredible.
[02:52:15.876 --> 02:52:18.738]  Alright, as this develops, we'll stay in contact with you, Jim.
[02:52:18.778 --> 02:52:19.898]  We appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:52:21.219 --> 02:52:24.061]  Just trying to do the right thing and let people know what's going on.

[02:52:26.043 --> 02:52:26.363]  Thank you.
[02:52:27.944 --> 02:52:31.006]  Okay, I tell you, it just never seems to end, does it?
[02:52:31.126 --> 02:52:35.349]  We try to not say this is some conspiracy, and then it just, evidence always starts going there.
[02:52:35.369 --> 02:52:35.729]  Well, I hope.
[02:52:37.472 --> 02:52:42.414]  We know they've staged things in the past and it's an Operation Northwoods to stage mass shootings and blame Patsy's.
[02:52:42.914 --> 02:52:43.995]  I don't know what's going on anymore.
[02:52:44.335 --> 02:52:46.236]  We know the Russians got caught doing it a few years ago.
[02:52:46.676 --> 02:52:49.577]  Retransmission starts now with tons of guest info.
[02:52:50.057 --> 02:52:53.719]  The first hour I addressed the New York Times attacking me, so stay with us.

[02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:12.242]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:53:12.302 --> 02:53:15.063]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.

[02:53:18.304 --> 02:53:23.046]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:53:23.266 --> 02:53:24.207]  If you simply prepare.
[02:53:24.387 --> 02:53:27.349]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
