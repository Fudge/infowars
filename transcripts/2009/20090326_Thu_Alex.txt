[00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:09.695]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:11.275]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:12.836]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:17.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:21.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.660]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us for another worldwide live transmission.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.241]  It is the 26th day, a Thursday of March 2009.
[00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.081]  And we are going to be live here for the next four hours today.
[00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:04.496]  Who do we have on the show today?
[00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:12.418]  John McManus, President of the John Birch Society in studio.
[00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:20.001]  And we're also going to have Brian Garrison to talk about Common Purpose going on in England, which is a shadow government that effectively runs the UK.
[00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:26.443]  It also ties into the Obama national security issue and his youth brigade forces.
[00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:31.197]  So that is coming up.
[00:01:31.197 --> 00:01:32.318]  Those are the guests today.
[00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:40.379]  We're going to have open phones throughout the four hours of the show.
[00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:42.400]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.520]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.180]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.906]  Massive news day.
[00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.048]  I tell you, we always have huge news days now.
[00:02:02.048 --> 00:02:09.814]  It's quickening worldwide on every issue and every facet of society.
[00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:10.375]  Clinton.
[00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:19.463]  North Korea plans to fire missile provocative US fleet steaming towards the nation.
[00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:21.745]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said
[00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:31.766]  Last night, uh, warned that North Korea that fired a missile for any purpose would be a provocative act that would have consequences.
[00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:37.789]  North Korea is loading a rocket on a launch pad in anticipation of the launch of a communications satellite between April 4th and the 8th.
[00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:38.049]  U.S.
[00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:49.414]  counter-proliferation intelligence officials said North Korea announced its intention to launch the satellite in February, but regional powers worry the claim is a cover for the launch of a long-range missile capable of reaching Alaska.
[00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:52.375]  In fact, I meant to Google this this morning to print the old article.
[00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.104]  Uh, but, uh, so I would have it, it was in mainstream news, but it didn't get a lot of attention.
[00:02:58.104 --> 00:02:59.745]  In fact, Google this for me.
[00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:03.329]  North Korean test missile hits Alaska.
[00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.671]  North Korean missile hits Alaska.
[00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:07.874]  And, uh, it was a ICBM test.
[00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:09.555]  It didn't have a warhead.
[00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.959]  And it, uh, hit the barren waste of Alaska.
[00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:26.210]  But they didn't want that to be a big news issue in 2001 because they were already busy hyping how deadly Saddam was and how he had to be invaded and attacked because he supposedly had missiles and nukes and everything else.
[00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.651]  So, we'll be getting into that report.
[00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:34.413]  Huge news, huge development on the whole FEMA camp collapse of society front.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.904]  Bloomberg reports Schwarzenegger opens California fairgrounds to homeless camp.
[00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:52.688]  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said a makeshift tent city for the homeless that sprang up in the capital city of Sacramento will be shut down.
[00:03:52.688 --> 00:03:54.609]  That's a huge precedent.
[00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.329]  Oh, you're homeless.
[00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.430]  We're not going to let you live on
[00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.951]  The park grounds.
[00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:02.873]  And it's residents allowed to stay at the state fairgrounds.
[00:04:02.873 --> 00:04:05.234]  So this is very serious.
[00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:08.876]  This sets the precedent where they say, OK, you can't live in a tent now.
[00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:15.719]  We're going to make you go to a fenced in area with police and basically be prisoners like the Superdome in New Orleans.
[00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.740]  And this is going to be done statewide.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.941]  Other states are moving in the same direction.
[00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:23.603]  And so this means you're going to be institutionalized if you're homeless.
[00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:24.903]  And here's the issue.
[00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:25.884]  Middle class people.
[00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:33.753]  And working class folks, living on the edge of poverty, the working poor, are losing their houses, losing their homes.
[00:04:33.753 --> 00:04:41.500]  They're trying, most of them, to live in their cars, to raise enough money to get, you know, the down payment, the two months rent, to move into an apartment.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.964]  The deposit, we've talked to a lot of them, the media has.
[00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:51.929]  They're going to be made to go stay in a fenced-in facility with the crackheads, with the heroin heads, with the crazies.
[00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:55.178]  Who have been dumped out of the mental institutions.
[00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:57.760]  So, this is the start of the FEMA camp.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.241]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:04.515]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:09.917]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:15.060]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:26.185]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:32.370]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.635]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:39.676]  What about you?
[00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:41.598]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:07.036]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:12.340]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.412]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.373]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.373 --> 00:06:23.834]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:34.578]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:38.684]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.684 --> 00:06:40.544]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.544 --> 00:06:47.467]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:55.730]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.291]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.291 --> 00:07:04.474]  The people strike back.
[00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:05.634]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:10.969]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:17.194]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:19.857]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:22.819]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.384]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:28.425]  Not.
[00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:29.746]  Get the tea.
[00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:30.927]  Change your body and life
[00:07:31.297 --> 00:07:33.178]  From unhealthy to healthy.

[00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:43.505]  The tea that changes how you feel.
[00:08:01.245 --> 00:08:17.439]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:29.268]  By the way, I am dispatching Jason Douglas and Rob Doon, our producers, who also are professional cameramen.
[00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:34.305]  Worked for major TV networks.
[00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:34.805]  Good guys.
[00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:36.646]  Great to have them on board with us.
[00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:41.087]  They are being dispatched this weekend to California.
[00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:49.108]  They're going to go to Sacramento and then to Los Angeles to cover the tent cities that are popping up like mushrooms after a rain.
[00:08:49.108 --> 00:08:51.649]  They're also going to go to some of Schwarzenegger's press conferences.
[00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:54.129]  They are going to interview people there.
[00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:58.650]  So we're going to have reports from them on the ground Monday and Tuesday.
[00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:04.183]  Here on this syndicated radio transmission from 11 a.m.
[00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:06.085]  to 3 p.m.
[00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:09.569]  Again, Clinton, North Korea plans to fire missile provocative.
[00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:13.553]  Schwarzenegger opens California fairgrounds to homeless camp.
[00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.515]  That's coming up.
[00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:22.083]  London police encourage citizens to report contents of each other's trash bins to prevent terrorism.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:32.147]  Levin declares no constitutional authority for expanded Obama administration takeover powers of business.
[00:09:32.147 --> 00:09:32.828]  U.S.
[00:09:32.828 --> 00:09:37.112]  2010 apocalypse avoidable, says Scholar.
[00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:41.417]  States consider drug tests for welfare recipients all part of making them prisoners.
[00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:42.999]  You take money from the government, you're going to be a prisoner.
[00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:47.072]  Senate reviewing how college football picks number one.
[00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:48.733]  So we have all this serious news going on.
[00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:51.654]  They're spending their time on how the championship is decided.
[00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:53.454]  It's Associated Press.
[00:09:53.454 --> 00:10:00.097]  Two-faced Geithner assures CFR puppet masters he's open to global currency.
[00:10:00.097 --> 00:10:03.698]  Pentagon exploring robot killers that can fire on their own.
[00:10:03.698 --> 00:10:07.459]  McClatchy News.
[00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:12.021]  Close to home, Press Democrat reports, how can volunteerism in America be mandatory?
[00:10:13.305 --> 00:10:14.526]  We've got some good news there.
[00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:16.927]  You know, we break this stuff as it develops.
[00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:23.192]  Two days ago, that they had compulsory national service in both versions of the bill.
[00:10:23.192 --> 00:10:26.554]  Then they dropped one of the two provisions out of the Senate bill.
[00:10:26.554 --> 00:10:33.779]  And the latest copy I read this morning, they have now taken it out of the Senate version, but it's still in the House version.
[00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:36.641]  There's five different compulsory service bills in the House.
[00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:39.382]  Three different ones that we know of, and we're not omnipresent, folks.
[00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:41.964]  We're trying to keep track of all of this with everything else.
[00:10:41.964 --> 00:10:43.085]  We've got too many balls in the air.
[00:10:44.086 --> 00:10:56.982]  So that is good news, but the point is they're trying to sneak compulsory service through and they're keeping the language in some of the House versions about setting up a new federal agency to prepare for compulsory service.
[00:10:58.484 --> 00:11:01.367]  They are certainly trying it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:10.194]  A disgusting headline, the mail newspaper out of England, I'm having a very good crisis, says Soros, as hedge fund managers make billions off recession.
[00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:18.101]  I saw reports yesterday, the top ten hedge fund members, one made three billion, one made two and a half billion, the others made two billion, a billion and a half.
[00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:23.866]  That's individually, not the hedge funds, the individuals who are managing portfolios.
[00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:25.047]  That's their percentage.
[00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:32.771]  Of the profit manipulating different areas of the stock market in commodities and oil and other things.
[00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:34.512]  So that's a disgusting quote from him.
[00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:35.492]  I'll get into more of what he said.
[00:11:35.492 --> 00:11:38.213]  He said it's the culmination of his life's work.
[00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:39.353]  That's a quote.
[00:11:39.353 --> 00:11:40.654]  It's just wonderful to do this.
[00:11:40.654 --> 00:11:42.175]  He just loves doing this.
[00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:44.736]  He's one of the guys behind Obama.
[00:11:44.736 --> 00:11:48.957]  So we'll be getting into that report as well.
[00:11:48.957 --> 00:11:50.098]  We got contacted
[00:11:52.827 --> 00:12:05.516]  A couple days ago that the head of the John Birch Society, the president of the John Birch Society, is in Texas on a tour, in Houston and San Antonio and Dallas and places, and that he'd be happy to be interviewed.
[00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:15.183]  So we've got him coming into studio in about 45 minutes he's scheduled to be here, so that should be an interesting interview that is coming up today.
[00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:32.385]  Now, and by the way, we're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv when he's in studio with us, so we'll go live, not in the, we won't start in the third and fourth hour, we're going to go ahead and do three hours today at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:40.013]  And all three hours of the InfoWarrior, simulcast on the Genesis Network, being picked up by MNFM stations, we appreciate them picking it up, nine to midnight central,
[00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:58.985]  All of that show, the complete three hours, is simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv, so you get the Obama Deception, Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising, all of my films, a whole bunch of other films we've been authorized to post, hundreds and hundreds of my in-studio interviews, expanded extras from all the films,
[00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:14.933]  On and on and on, audio in higher quality, PrisonPlanet.tv and the simulcast of this radio show when it becomes slash TV show, and of course, Jason Burmas and the Info Warrior, 9 to Midnight, here on Genesis.
[00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:22.220]  Okay, let me get into the top story today.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.321]  No, it's not a U.S.
[00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:25.202]  fleet steaming towards North Korea.
[00:13:25.202 --> 00:13:26.863]  That is important, we'll get into it.
[00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:36.548]  But domestically, how many times in the last decade did I describe how they would roll out FEMA camps?
[00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:42.331]  They would say that they were for economic collapse and for housing people.
[00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:57.155]  And then we saw in New Orleans when they went into high and dry areas, not just in the city, but all over that state, confiscating firearms from people's homes that were high and dry and had generators, everything, and then putting people in the crime-ridden Superdome.
[00:13:57.155 --> 00:14:09.659]  They made people go to the Superdome, where all of the drug dealers, the criminals, the rapists, and in the last 20 years they've kicked most of the mentally ill people out of state hospitals.
[00:14:10.874 --> 00:14:12.875]  And so they're all in there as well.
[00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:16.317]  So your family can't stay in your house, you've got to go there.
[00:14:16.317 --> 00:14:18.278]  And then you have the gun confiscation going on.
[00:14:18.278 --> 00:14:19.759]  So we know how the feds operate.
[00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:30.345]  I've been telling you that as tent cities pop up in Texas and Michigan and New York and Florida and California and Oregon and Arizona and Nevada, tent cities everywhere.
[00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:45.982]  As these Obamavilles, as Webster Tarpley calls them, pop up everywhere, that the key would be when they said, okay, you can't go out on government land, you can't go out on a national park, you can't go out on the edge of a city park where they could just bring in porta-potties.
[00:14:45.982 --> 00:14:53.146]  We're going to make you go to sports stadiums and go to fairgrounds.
[00:14:53.146 --> 00:14:57.209]  And one of the guys that works here in the office lived in Sacramento.
[00:14:58.573 --> 00:15:03.057]  And he says the fairgrounds is, you know, the barbed wire facing in and out.
[00:15:03.057 --> 00:15:16.367]  It's a perfect, FEMA can't remember, late last year in several states FEMA had drills at the stockyards around the country in fairgrounds of rounding people up and putting them in there and doing forced inoculations and other things.
[00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:17.808]  That's what's now happening.
[00:15:17.808 --> 00:15:21.611]  They're saying you can't go out and pitch a tent, you can't go out and live out of your car.
[00:15:22.608 --> 00:15:24.709]  And the people are trying to raise money while they do that.
[00:15:24.709 --> 00:15:26.230]  They're working jobs.
[00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.850]  This is the working poor.
[00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:33.413]  These aren't the classic alcoholic or drug addict or person who's mentally ill.
[00:15:33.413 --> 00:15:38.255]  You're now seeing, even here in Austin, good-looking families out begging for money.
[00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:44.858]  You're seeing people that don't fit the mold of the hobo that are doing this.
[00:15:44.858 --> 00:15:49.720]  It's not the poor, shell-shocked, PTSD, Vietnam vets.
[00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:58.773]  And all over the nation, they tell them you can't sleep on a park bench, you can't sleep, you know, under a bridge.
[00:15:58.773 --> 00:16:01.055]  And then the homeless shelters are full.
[00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:06.280]  So at night in Austin, Texas, a couple years ago, you might see two or three people sleeping out front.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.242]  The four different homeless shelters just in downtown.
[00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:11.364]  You'll see shots of this in the Obama reception.
[00:16:11.364 --> 00:16:14.486]  You go down there at night now in front of these, and there might be as many as 60, 70, 80, 100.
[00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.618]  And that'll just be out front, under the street lamps.
[00:16:19.618 --> 00:16:22.159]  You go around the back, they're sleeping behind dumpsters.
[00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:24.040]  They're everywhere.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.762]  And believe me, these folks are in nasty moods.
[00:16:25.762 --> 00:16:28.403]  They're not drunk, they're not on drugs.
[00:16:28.403 --> 00:16:32.886]  It is, it is just absolutely scary.
[00:16:32.886 --> 00:16:36.808]  And remember what major universities came out with in the last few months.
[00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:41.892]  7 million people during the 10-year depression starved to death in this country.
[00:16:41.892 --> 00:16:42.492]  And that was with 90%
[00:16:45.174 --> 00:16:51.262]  Of Americans at the time of the Depression living on farms, living in the country, being quote self-sufficient.
[00:16:51.262 --> 00:16:52.644]  But the banks called in the loans.
[00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:56.769]  They said, oh, you owe $20,000 on your family farm.
[00:16:56.769 --> 00:16:58.011]  You gotta pay it all today.
[00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:02.639]  Oh, you owe $3,000 on your family farm, which was the equivalent of hundreds of thousands.
[00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.060]  You've got to pay it now.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.121]  It's due.
[00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:11.687]  And from Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, and all over the country, they had to go west.
[00:17:11.687 --> 00:17:16.011]  And their cars broke down, they starved to death, they literally set up slave camps.
[00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:18.853]  You watch the movie, The Grapes of Wrath, where they're basically slaves.
[00:17:18.853 --> 00:17:22.857]  That's far, far better than what the reality was.
[00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:32.741]  Now we have 90% who are not self-sufficient, 10% living on farms, and only half of that 10% being self-sufficient.
[00:17:32.741 --> 00:17:36.708]  So, 5% total are self-sufficient, 10% living on farms.
[00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:42.367]  So you have 10% living on farms or ranches, but only half of those are self-sufficient.
[00:17:42.367 --> 00:17:45.790]  That's 5% of the country, instead of 90% being self-sufficient.
[00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.071]  This is about domestication.
[00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:48.372]  This is about control.
[00:17:48.372 --> 00:17:51.735]  This is this highly organized and manipulated society.
[00:17:51.735 --> 00:17:55.179]  This is the crises they bring in in third world nations and old world nations.
[00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:58.602]  IMF World Bank documents by design to reorganize society.
[00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:01.484]  This is a literal military attack financially.
[00:18:02.335 --> 00:18:07.063]  And now Schwarzenegger's saying, in the state of California, you're not going to sleep on the street.
[00:18:07.063 --> 00:18:08.566]  You're not going to sleep in a park.
[00:18:08.566 --> 00:18:10.309]  You're not going to pull up in your van.
[00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:11.471]  You're not going to sleep in your van.
[00:18:12.984 --> 00:18:15.486]  The cities aren't going to provide porta-potties anymore.
[00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:20.149]  You're going to go to FEMA centers with federal funds.
[00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:21.530]  And they're going to be fairgrounds.
[00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.371]  And they're going to be sports stadiums.
[00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:25.052]  That's why they built them all over the country.
[00:18:25.052 --> 00:18:28.054]  And there'll be nightly movies and bands that come in and play for them.
[00:18:28.054 --> 00:18:30.755]  And it'll be on the news, oh look, the camp is fun.
[00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:40.502]  And your family will have to be around all the crackheads and all the smackheads and all the schizophrenics and all the mentally ill people and all the psychos and all the racists.
[00:18:42.383 --> 00:18:48.404]  Because what happens is the smack heads get their own little shantytown, the coke heads get their own little shantytown.
[00:18:48.404 --> 00:18:51.205]  This is how it works in Californian places.
[00:18:51.205 --> 00:18:56.526]  And the lower middle class people, the working poor, they go and they get along and there's not any crime.
[00:18:56.526 --> 00:18:57.966]  That's been confirmed.
[00:18:57.966 --> 00:18:59.286]  Very, very low crime.
[00:18:59.286 --> 00:19:00.667]  And they actually kind of have a good time.
[00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:02.227]  And they all go get jobs.
[00:19:02.227 --> 00:19:04.407]  And a lot of them are only in these shantytowns a few months.
[00:19:04.407 --> 00:19:05.668]  They go get two or three jobs.
[00:19:05.668 --> 00:19:08.488]  They raise the money they need and they go get the apartment they need.
[00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:10.209]  Or they go get the rent house they need.
[00:19:10.209 --> 00:19:11.529]  That isn't going to happen now.
[00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:24.560]  You're going to a FEMA camp, and you and your family and your children are going to be there, and there's going to be CPS there, and they're going to say, oh look, we've observed you with your five-year-old son or daughter in here.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.064]  That means that you're not competent to take care of your children, and they're at risk, and we're going to take your children.
[00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:33.508]  And that's in the California news, and California is the model for the rest of the country.
[00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:36.216]  It's only come back.
[00:19:36.216 --> 00:19:39.459]  Schwarzenegger opens California fairgrounds to homeless.
[00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:49.566]  California governor said makeshift tent city for the homeless that sprung up in the capital city of Sacramento will be shut down and its residents allowed to stay at the state fairgrounds.
[00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:56.311]  He ordered the state facility known as Cal Expo to be used for three months to serve 125 tent city residents.
[00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:57.632]  Then they'll move them somewhere else.
[00:19:57.632 --> 00:19:58.073]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.724 --> 00:20:07.248]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.269]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:15.653]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:20.126]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[00:20:20.126 --> 00:20:21.407]  We have been warned.
[00:20:21.407 --> 00:20:27.689]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[00:20:27.689 --> 00:20:28.429]  Too late.
[00:20:28.429 --> 00:20:31.630]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.051]  Why?
[00:20:32.051 --> 00:20:35.832]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:44.106]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[00:20:44.106 --> 00:20:48.009]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[00:20:48.009 --> 00:20:50.491]  Go to YourFoodStorage.com.
[00:20:50.491 --> 00:20:52.954]  That's YourFoodStorage.com.
[00:20:52.954 --> 00:20:55.976]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[00:20:55.976 --> 00:21:00.060]  That's 877-482-FOOD today.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.644]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.071 --> 00:21:10.956]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:12.057]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:12.057 --> 00:21:16.781]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:30.033]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:30.573 --> 00:21:36.175]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.175 --> 00:21:42.818]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:42.818 --> 00:21:44.118]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:44.118 --> 00:21:45.819]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:46.239]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.239 --> 00:21:48.280]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:48.340]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.842 --> 00:22:06.648]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.648 --> 00:22:13.636]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:20.804]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.804 --> 00:22:22.784]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.784 --> 00:22:25.285]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.285 --> 00:22:36.870]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.530]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.891]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:47.309]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:55.577]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.577 --> 00:22:57.159]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:58.340]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:03.707]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:07.490]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:13.794]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:23:13.794 --> 00:23:17.897]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:23:18.417 --> 00:23:24.441]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:27.864]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:32.507]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:23:32.507 --> 00:23:38.751]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:43.734]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:23:43.734 --> 00:23:47.637]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:23:48.097 --> 00:23:50.958]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.
[00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:54.639]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:23:54.639 --> 00:23:58.340]  877-327-0365.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.020]  Don't wait.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.001]  Call today.
[00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:15.765]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:24:15.765 --> 00:24:16.905]  People can be made
[00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:25.334]  To enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:30.896]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:24:30.896 --> 00:24:36.458]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:38.239]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:44.794]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:47.118]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:49.604]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:24:51.767 --> 00:24:58.112]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:24:58.112 --> 00:25:04.996]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:25:04.996 --> 00:25:10.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.942]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:25:12.942 --> 00:25:17.285]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:18.946]  I have to work with Darkseid over there.
[00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:20.187]  I'll spend time in the shadows.
[00:25:21.508 --> 00:25:25.533]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:26.834]  Well, join me.
[00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:29.217]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:25:29.217 --> 00:25:32.581]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:39.108]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:26:25.115 --> 00:26:53.912]  From Nazareth he came With a ragtag band To bring a revolution Some would make him king Others couldn't stand for that The cross was a solution But he rose again Wise men followed him
[00:26:55.244 --> 00:27:23.615]  Heroes again Wise men follow him Thank God for the renegades And the lives they lead Born ahead of their time Without the renegades Lord knows where we'd be When it comes to heroes Renegades are mine
[00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:48.960]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band, declaring independence.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:57.686]  They laid their bodies down, on a bloody wall, at liberty for their descendants.
[00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:22.144]  Thanks to the renegades We're free today Thanks to the renegades We're free today Thank God for the renegades And the lives they lead Far ahead of their time
[00:28:27.771 --> 00:28:30.597]  We're good.
[00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:03.732]  Where are the renegades in the world today?
[00:29:03.732 --> 00:29:07.914]  Who are the renegades in the world today?
[00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:16.517]  Thank God for the renegades and the lives they lead.
[00:29:16.517 --> 00:29:22.039]  Far ahead of their time.
[00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:23.740]  Without the renegades
[00:29:25.071 --> 00:29:27.452]  We're on the march.
[00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:30.134]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.830 --> 00:30:00.974]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.974 --> 00:30:02.355]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[00:30:02.355 --> 00:30:04.757]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:30:04.757 --> 00:30:08.920]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.961]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:30:15.663 --> 00:30:25.072]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:30:25.072 --> 00:30:31.458]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:35.062]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:30:35.062 --> 00:30:39.466]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:30:39.466 --> 00:30:40.207]  For the rest of you,
[00:30:45.913 --> 00:30:49.156]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.322 --> 00:31:13.183]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.183 --> 00:31:19.685]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:21.665]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.665 --> 00:31:24.126]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:35.008]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.316 --> 00:31:38.976]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.976 --> 00:31:40.837]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:47.738]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.738 --> 00:31:56.000]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.581]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:58.761]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.723 --> 00:32:05.244]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:32:05.244 --> 00:32:10.326]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:10.326 --> 00:32:11.866]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:15.467]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.062]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:32:40.062 --> 00:32:41.483]  And I say big time.
[00:32:41.483 --> 00:32:42.724]  Call Calbin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.

[00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:33.924]  We are back live.
[00:33:33.924 --> 00:33:41.987]  I was just on KMOX, one of the big talk stations in Missouri, out of St.
[00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:48.948]  Louis, and they said they wanted a three minute quote for their news, and then it went longer, so I had to run that music earlier.
[00:33:48.948 --> 00:34:01.232]  I did an hour interview on a syndicated African American show out of Maryland that's on all over the country, The Valentine Show, The Truth Seeker, and I'm not whining here, I got Russia Today coming for an hour long interview,
[00:34:02.615 --> 00:34:07.778]  I'm turning down most of the interviews because I just can't even operate or see my family.
[00:34:07.778 --> 00:34:11.340]  But that's the good news is that we are so busy.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.922]  We are reaching out to so many people.
[00:34:13.922 --> 00:34:15.983]  So many people are reaching out to us.
[00:34:15.983 --> 00:34:17.084]  The word is spreading.
[00:34:17.084 --> 00:34:25.048]  The Obama deception has just triggered massive new internet numbers to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:25.048 --> 00:34:29.170]  We are really breaking out at an even higher plateau now.
[00:34:30.271 --> 00:34:34.459]  So please keep spreading the word about the radio show.
[00:34:34.459 --> 00:34:38.406]  We've got the president of the John Birch Society in studio.
[00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:39.869]  Then we've got Patrice O'Neal.
[00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:44.990]  on the show as well.
[00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.833]  A well-known comedian does shows on VH1, MTV, you name it.
[00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:54.237]  He's been going on national radio shows and plugging and talking about the Obama deception when we were opening in Anthony.
[00:34:54.237 --> 00:35:01.843]  It's the fourth biggest shock jock show in the country and for an hour, you know, talked about the Obama deception and got them to watch it.
[00:35:01.843 --> 00:35:03.485]  I mean, so that's really interesting.
[00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:08.269]  I want to get his take on what is happening as well today.
[00:35:11.001 --> 00:35:12.423]  There is so much going on.
[00:35:12.423 --> 00:35:13.805]  You know, I said I was going to go to your calls.
[00:35:13.805 --> 00:35:19.912]  We've got all these guests coming up, so I want to go ahead and do that here in a moment for Eric and Patrick and Joshua and John and Brent.
[00:35:19.912 --> 00:35:27.602]  But let me finish up with our top stories quickly, and then I'm going to go right to you.
[00:35:27.602 --> 00:35:29.945]  Just trying to multitask here and catch my breath.
[00:35:31.664 --> 00:35:51.255]  We're also planning the trip to send the guys, two of the guys, Rob and Rob Due and Jason Douglas to California to cover how they're forcing people out of the makeshift cities into the FEMA camp, FEMA camps with an S. So let me go ahead and cover that now and then I'll go to your calls.
[00:35:51.255 --> 00:35:52.276]  Let's get to the other news later.
[00:35:53.948 --> 00:35:54.848]  Bloomberg!
[00:35:54.848 --> 00:36:05.531]  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said a makeshift tent city for homeless that sprang up in the capital city of Sacramento will be shut down as its residents allowed to stay at the state fairgrounds.
[00:36:05.531 --> 00:36:06.311]  Oh, how nice of them.
[00:36:06.311 --> 00:36:08.472]  See how they phrase it as it's a nice thing?
[00:36:08.472 --> 00:36:16.114]  Schwarzenegger said he ordered the state facility known as Cal Expo to be used for three months to serve the 125 tent city residents.
[00:36:16.114 --> 00:36:16.874]  It's more than that.
[00:36:17.614 --> 00:36:20.655]  There's four tent cities in Sacramento alone.
[00:36:20.655 --> 00:36:22.876]  Some of them displaced by the economic recession.
[00:36:22.876 --> 00:36:24.416]  The media tries to play this down.
[00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:29.118]  The encampment may be shut down within a month, said Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson.
[00:36:29.118 --> 00:36:35.860]  The move comes after the Sacramento City Council last night agreed to spend $880,000 to expand homeless programs.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.541]  So that's, a lot of that's federal funds.
[00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:44.203]  Together with the local government and volunteers, we are taking a first step to ensure that people living in a tent city have a safe place to stay.
[00:36:45.023 --> 00:36:50.111]  With fresh water, healthy conditions, and access to services they need, like CPS kidnapping their children.
[00:36:50.111 --> 00:36:54.978]  Schwarzenegger went on to say... California, home to one of...
[00:37:01.656 --> 00:37:10.704]  Every eight, one in every eight Americans has been particularly hard hit by the housing market collapse after many residents turned to exotic mortgages to afford homes.
[00:37:10.704 --> 00:37:21.574]  The tent city, which has long existed along the banks of the American River, gained national attention last month when some of its recently homeless residents were featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show.
[00:37:21.574 --> 00:37:25.897]  The state has one of the highest rates of foreclosure according to Realty Track Inc.
[00:37:26.698 --> 00:37:34.302]  An Irvine, California-based seller of real estate data, California home prices dropped 41% last month from a year earlier, more than double the U.S.
[00:37:34.302 --> 00:37:40.365]  decline as surging foreclosures drove down home values, the State Association of Realtors said.
[00:37:40.365 --> 00:37:52.050]  State unemployment is at 10.5% in February, and that's a Cook number, it's more like 20, as constructions, financial and manufacturing companies eliminated jobs, leaving the most populous U.S.
[00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.851]  state with one of the nation's worst job markets.
[00:37:54.851 --> 00:37:55.352]  But don't worry,
[00:37:56.611 --> 00:37:58.632]  8 million illegal aliens that live in California alone.
[00:37:58.632 --> 00:37:59.632]  They're doing great.
[00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:03.973]  The shelter at Cal Expo currently houses about 150 people.
[00:38:03.973 --> 00:38:09.034]  It will be expanded by another 50 beds and will include facilities for families with children.
[00:38:09.034 --> 00:38:12.495]  So CPS will grab some of these children.
[00:38:12.495 --> 00:38:14.796]  You can be guaranteed of that.
[00:38:16.343 --> 00:38:17.884]  Unless we get the word out and stop them.
[00:38:17.884 --> 00:38:20.585]  So, how did I tell you they'd introduce this?
[00:38:20.585 --> 00:38:21.205]  Years ago.
[00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:25.227]  As the economy collapses, oh, we're going to put people in the Expo Center.
[00:38:25.227 --> 00:38:27.689]  And it's got barbed wire fence around it.
[00:38:27.689 --> 00:38:44.437]  And inside the facility, they will now force the nice families that are living out by themselves in communities together, raising enough money, most of them end up getting out in a few months, they just sit there, live in their cars, camp out with their tents, raise the money they need, and move on.
[00:38:44.437 --> 00:38:44.617]  No!
[00:38:46.438 --> 00:38:48.140]  No.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.761]  You are going to be harassed.
[00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:50.822]  You are going to be controlled.
[00:38:50.822 --> 00:38:52.303]  You are going to be surveilled.
[00:38:52.303 --> 00:39:00.750]  You are going to be with the crackheads and the heroin heads and the mentally ill people that make up the predominant portion of the homeless.
[00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.473]  And you are going to be in the Expo Center living in tents.
[00:39:05.523 --> 00:39:08.725]  And there will be police there, and there will be checkpoints to get in and out.
[00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:10.346]  That's how they always do this.
[00:39:10.346 --> 00:39:14.588]  And it will be advertised as the government camp, and this will sell the population.
[00:39:14.588 --> 00:39:19.571]  They're setting up other camps across the country, and they've built FEMA camps as the collapse accelerates.
[00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:22.192]  So this is big, big news.
[00:39:22.192 --> 00:39:25.094]  And I hope some of the callers I'm about to go to want to comment on this.
[00:39:25.094 --> 00:39:27.535]  We'll continue to discuss it throughout the broadcast.
[00:39:27.535 --> 00:39:34.238]  But forcing them, the precedent here is you're not going to stay in your car, you're not going to stay in a tent.
[00:39:34.238 --> 00:39:34.439]  No!
[00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:36.440]  No, you're homeless.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.422]  You're going to go to a government facility.
[00:39:39.422 --> 00:39:49.689]  You're going to be harassed and arrested or pushed into this, and then the social services are going to piratically feed on you.
[00:39:49.689 --> 00:39:52.991]  This is outrageous.
[00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:55.272]  Let's go ahead and go to Eric in California.
[00:39:55.272 --> 00:39:56.053]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:39:56.053 --> 00:39:59.455]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:39:59.455 --> 00:39:59.755]  Good.
[00:39:59.755 --> 00:40:03.838]  Hey, Eric, how many times if you're a listener have you heard me talk about how they would force people into these facilities?
[00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:08.834]  Oh man, you've been talking about it forever.
[00:40:08.834 --> 00:40:11.176]  Chickens are coming home to roost, I tell you what.
[00:40:11.176 --> 00:40:24.465]  You know, I'm here in California, and I'm in the building trade, and the last six months I've had to cut my wages in half while everything else goes up.
[00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:26.707]  Services go down, taxes go up.
[00:40:26.707 --> 00:40:34.333]  Well, Schwarzenegger, whose father was an SS officer, a political officer arresting people, don't worry, he's got a camp for you.
[00:40:35.854 --> 00:40:38.336]  Yeah, well, I will refrain from there.
[00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:41.157]  Hey, Alex, I've been trying to get on for a while.
[00:40:41.157 --> 00:40:46.641]  I know I call a lot, but I've got some things that are on my chest here.
[00:40:46.641 --> 00:40:50.403]  First one concerning the Obama deception and copying it.
[00:40:50.403 --> 00:41:00.770]  I recently purchased from an eBay seller a 1 to 3 duplicator, and it was suggested to me that I get it from another gentleman.
[00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.991]  But if anybody would like to get one,
[00:41:03.612 --> 00:41:11.836]  You can find it at MegaLynx, that's M-E-G-A-L-Y-N-X, Lynx, MegaLynx.
[00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.957]  It's a one to three duplicator for $197.
[00:41:13.957 --> 00:41:28.904]  There's a lot of great units, double duplicators, triple, quadruple duplicators, ten duplicators, and you can just pop the original high quality disc in, pop the dummies in, and I'm glad you're doing okay financially enough to be able to do that.
[00:41:28.904 --> 00:41:30.104]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:30.104 --> 00:41:31.725]  That is how we're going to turn things around.
[00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:37.799]  I got some help from the 9-11 DVD project guy, Tom Tweeden.
[00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:46.532]  Anyhow, my business idea that I have recently concerns Victory Gardens.
[00:41:47.096 --> 00:41:50.018]  However, I'd like to start calling them Liberty Gardens.
[00:41:50.018 --> 00:41:51.459]  I don't know if they're allowed to do that, though.
[00:41:51.459 --> 00:42:01.685]  They've got a bill that would basically make you get a license to have a garden, and a lot of city officials from California to Oregon to Oklahoma say maybe you can't be allowed without an inspection.
[00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.126]  Maybe you're growing pot.
[00:42:03.126 --> 00:42:05.927]  A prisoner isn't allowed to grow their own food.
[00:42:05.927 --> 00:42:08.349]  You think this is a free country, pal?
[00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:10.790]  Hey, uh, Alex, uh... Don't you try to grow a garden, buddy!
[00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.932]  Are you with Al-Qaeda?
[00:42:12.932 --> 00:42:15.093]  Listen, this is the remedy.
[00:42:15.535 --> 00:42:22.701]  If enough people are starting Victory Garden and they get a taste of good, organic, tasteful food, maybe we'll start doing it.
[00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:28.265]  And more people will be exposed to the crimes of Monsanto and how they're pushing this.
[00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:28.665]  I agree.
[00:42:28.665 --> 00:42:32.488]  We should call them Liberty Gardens just like they were in World War II.
[00:42:32.488 --> 00:42:36.491]  And don't let the police intimidation stop you from growing a garden.
[00:42:36.491 --> 00:42:37.352]  You're allowed to.
[00:42:37.352 --> 00:42:38.373]  You're an American.
[00:42:38.373 --> 00:42:40.194]  We're not extremists for having gardens.
[00:42:40.194 --> 00:42:42.616]  Absolutely.
[00:42:43.266 --> 00:42:46.028]  And also, I've been meaning to ask you about this.
[00:42:46.028 --> 00:42:48.870]  What is your take on Lyndon LaRouche?
[00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:57.515]  Because when I was up in San Francisco recently, I ran into some of his guys, and I talked to them, and they gave me a bunch of material from them.
[00:42:57.515 --> 00:43:01.257]  And since then, they've been hounding me for donations.
[00:43:01.257 --> 00:43:02.918]  Yeah, that's been my experience.
[00:43:02.918 --> 00:43:05.280]  I appreciate your call, Eric.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.582]  One time, they aired their national show here locally.
[00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.550]  Yes.
[00:43:26.448 --> 00:43:29.350]  But then there's solutions I disagree with.
[00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:35.033]  And Webster Tarbly worked with them some, and he says it's bad news.
[00:43:35.033 --> 00:43:47.279]  I'm not trying to attack the LaRouche supporters, a lot of good people in there, but I don't endorse Little LaRouche, really.
[00:43:47.279 --> 00:43:49.200]  But I'm not trying to pick a fight here.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.961]  You just asked the question, I told you.
[00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.322]  Patrick in Toronto.
[00:43:52.322 --> 00:43:53.783]  You're on the air, Patrick.
[00:43:53.783 --> 00:43:55.644]  How you doing from the Great White North, brother?
[00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:59.288]  Hello sir, I hope you're not planning on growing a garden.
[00:43:59.288 --> 00:43:59.669]  Me?
[00:43:59.669 --> 00:44:00.109]  No.
[00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.529]  Gardens?
[00:44:00.529 --> 00:44:01.670]  Why would I want to do that?
[00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.410]  You're a goods?
[00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:04.551]  Good, good, good.
[00:44:04.551 --> 00:44:06.432]  Anyhow, I'm just calling from Toronto.
[00:44:06.432 --> 00:44:12.175]  Just wanted to share my enthusiasm and my excitement for the Obama deception.
[00:44:12.175 --> 00:44:15.317]  Just wanted to give some of the Canadian listeners a heads up.
[00:44:15.317 --> 00:44:20.320]  I checked the UPS shipping delivery schedule and I'm getting my box today.
[00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:29.695]  And I hope anyone in Toronto that's interested in picking up a copy can come by here and grab theirs, because I think I've got a hundred on their way today, and that's just my first order.
[00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:36.758]  So I just, anybody in Toronto, if you're looking for the Obama deception, conspiracy culture, we got it.
[00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:42.080]  That's right, you guys carry our books and films there, and we really, really appreciate you doing that.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:42.800]  Anything else, Patrick?
[00:44:43.453 --> 00:44:46.996]  No, I'm just slowly putting things together.
[00:44:46.996 --> 00:44:52.141]  We might be doing a screening of it in May, depending on whether or not I can get access to a local theatre.
[00:44:52.141 --> 00:45:08.517]  But even if I can't get the place I'm looking for, I'm most likely going to be doing a screening here in Toronto and see what I can do about getting some of the Obama followers to maybe consider opening up to some alternative information to maybe change their perception on who this guy actually is.
[00:45:10.629 --> 00:45:15.073]  Well, some of the invincibility and the god-likeness is starting to wear off.
[00:45:15.073 --> 00:45:23.280]  I was on a big national African-American talk show this morning, and he said, no, I know most of what, you know, is in your film is true.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.983]  I checked it out, but, you know, Obama himself isn't bad.
[00:45:25.983 --> 00:45:28.545]  You know, he has to put out rhetoric when he's running.
[00:45:28.545 --> 00:45:30.487]  And I said, no, no, this was change.
[00:45:30.487 --> 00:45:32.648]  He said, no more business as usual.
[00:45:32.648 --> 00:45:35.631]  This time it's really going to be different.
[00:45:35.631 --> 00:45:35.751]  And
[00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:44.003]  I tried to explain, this isn't about Obama, it's about who runs the government, the big banks.
[00:45:44.003 --> 00:46:00.876]  But see, by tying Obama to the globalist agenda, the guy was still halfway supporting their agenda, even though he knows the truth in his gut, because he identifies his entire personality, his entire world view, his identity, with Obama.
[00:46:00.876 --> 00:46:05.539]  Good to hear from you Patrick, appreciate your support getting the Obama deception, conspiracy culture there in Toronto.
[00:46:05.539 --> 00:46:07.581]  Joshua, in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.051]  Alex Jones, how are you doing, my friend?
[00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:12.413]  Fantastic.
[00:46:12.413 --> 00:46:14.874]  I have some news as well with the Obama deception.
[00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:17.096]  Great film, great film.
[00:46:17.096 --> 00:46:23.580]  I think it's pretty much the gateway documentary to get the sheeple into the mix of the New World Order.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.061]  Good way to put it.
[00:46:25.061 --> 00:46:28.804]  It is made for people that don't know about the New World Order.
[00:46:28.804 --> 00:46:31.926]  It's made to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[00:46:31.926 --> 00:46:33.226]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:33.226 --> 00:46:37.669]  We went to the Orlando Tea Party last week and we were able to give out about 500 copies.
[00:46:39.437 --> 00:46:46.160]  People are the high quality copies and we're going to go there having a anti-war rally in Melbourne this weekend.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.541]  We're going to go out there.
[00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:50.082]  I got about 500 copies printed up.
[00:46:50.082 --> 00:46:51.983]  We're going to get them out there.
[00:46:51.983 --> 00:46:59.026]  And, uh, I had an idea for like a, uh, guerrilla information warfare tactics.
[00:46:59.026 --> 00:47:06.710]  I think we could, I think we should do like a nationwide, uh, call in campaign, possibly call in on the Glenn Beck show.
[00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.811]  If I get all of your listeners,
[00:47:10.504 --> 00:47:15.869]  Absolutely!
[00:47:15.869 --> 00:47:21.115]  And call local shows and say there's a new film exposing Obama and the bankers and what they're really planning.
[00:47:21.115 --> 00:47:26.320]  It exposes that Bush is working with them as well, you know, so it's not a left-right issue.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.982]  And just say, The Obama Deception.
[00:47:27.982 --> 00:47:29.723]  Free at YouTube, free at Google.
[00:47:29.723 --> 00:47:30.684]  The Obama Deception.
[00:47:30.684 --> 00:47:32.066]  The Obama Deception.
[00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:33.287]  And just get it out to people.
[00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:35.982]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:35.982 --> 00:47:42.448]  I have in front of me Glenn Beck's radio call-in phone number if you want me to throw that out real quick.
[00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:43.309]  Is that cool?
[00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:45.711]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:47:45.711 --> 00:47:48.634]  Yeah, that's 1-888-727-2325.
[00:47:48.634 --> 00:47:52.497]  The show is from 9 a.m.
[00:47:52.497 --> 00:47:55.680]  to noon Eastern Standard Time.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.442]  And I want to encourage anybody in Florida
[00:47:58.485 --> 00:48:03.469]  Uh, to check us out at www.meetup.com backslash Orlando 911 Truth.
[00:48:03.469 --> 00:48:04.389]  We're getting pretty active.
[00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:07.771]  We're waking up all kind of people here in Florida.
[00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:11.454]  And we just encourage all the other groups to get active, get aggressive, man.
[00:48:11.454 --> 00:48:12.695]  This is crunch time.
[00:48:12.695 --> 00:48:15.236]  We really have to get on the ball, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:15.236 --> 00:48:19.159]  Joshua, what feedback, because you're very aggressive in what you're doing.
[00:48:19.159 --> 00:48:19.820]  God bless you.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:20.480]  I salute you.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.041]  You're a true info warrior.
[00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:24.663]  What feedback are you getting from those that have seen the Obama deception?
[00:48:26.122 --> 00:48:27.742]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:48:27.742 --> 00:48:31.563]  Everyone that has watched it has said, wow, that's just mind-blowing.
[00:48:31.563 --> 00:48:33.864]  And they always want to know what else.
[00:48:33.864 --> 00:48:37.004]  They come to find out where to go next, always.
[00:48:37.004 --> 00:48:38.064]  Send them to Endgame.
[00:48:38.064 --> 00:48:40.125]  Send them to Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:42.545]  Send them to 9-11 Mysteries.
[00:48:42.545 --> 00:48:46.126]  And it's just, it's a new renaissance, just like you said in the film, man.
[00:48:46.126 --> 00:48:50.707]  It's really exploding here, in Orlando especially.
[00:48:50.707 --> 00:48:53.508]  And it's just encouraging, like especially at the Tea Party.
[00:48:53.508 --> 00:48:55.708]  There were over 5,000 people at the Tea Party.
[00:48:56.249 --> 00:49:00.991]  I was encouraged to see about 500 of the Don't Tread on Me flags everywhere.
[00:49:00.991 --> 00:49:02.911]  And I had copies of the MIAC report.
[00:49:02.911 --> 00:49:09.514]  Every person I fought with a flag, we were running them down, telling them they were terrorists for having a flag and educating them.
[00:49:09.514 --> 00:49:10.734]  And people were getting angry, man.
[00:49:10.734 --> 00:49:24.499]  The Glenn Beck, even if he's part of some type of controlled opposition, it's a dangerous move by the elites because his audience is awake to the point to where if we can really infiltrate these tea parties,
[00:49:25.225 --> 00:49:29.388]  And show them the true oligarchy exposed to the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:29.388 --> 00:49:35.332]  We can really unlock their minds, because this is 5,000 angry Americans who are ready for a revolution.
[00:49:35.332 --> 00:49:48.040]  And we need to... If I had 100,000 of you, Joshua, that were as aggressive in prosecuting this war against tyranny, we would win this thing literally in a matter of months.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.001]  And I know we have millions of listeners.
[00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:51.963]  So folks, get aggressive.
[00:49:51.963 --> 00:49:53.524]  Do exactly what he's saying.
[00:49:54.364 --> 00:49:56.625]  That is exactly what is needed.
[00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:58.945]  People always want to make resisting so complex.
[00:49:58.945 --> 00:50:02.747]  They want to have six months of planning and get all paranoid about it.
[00:50:02.747 --> 00:50:08.728]  Just get out there, start getting the word out, get aggressive with the globalists.
[00:50:08.728 --> 00:50:10.269]  Absolutely, man.
[00:50:10.269 --> 00:50:15.870]  You inspire us all, Alex, and we wish there was a million more Alex Joneses as well.
[00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.011]  Well, let me tell you.
[00:50:18.169 --> 00:50:21.311]  A hundred thousand people like you, and we turn this thing around.
[00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:22.752]  You know, we've got millions of awake people.
[00:50:22.752 --> 00:50:32.779]  They've just got to be aggressive, and they've got to have a powerful tool like the Obama deception that instantly in the first five minutes shatters the left-right paradigm.
[00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:42.165]  Phony right-wing attacks on Obama only props up his base, only empowers him.
[00:50:43.379 --> 00:50:48.284]  But you go after him as a puppet and as establishment and tell the truth and show how he's a liar.
[00:50:48.284 --> 00:50:53.048]  The whole agenda can be shot down and is being shot down by the grace of God and activists like you.
[00:50:53.048 --> 00:50:54.710]  Joshua, I salute you.
[00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:55.871]  Fire out the website.
[00:50:55.871 --> 00:50:56.592]  It's meetup what?
[00:50:58.047 --> 00:51:01.531]  www.meetup.com backslash Orlando 9-11 church.
[00:51:01.531 --> 00:51:05.656]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[00:51:05.656 --> 00:51:07.558]  You are not alone.
[00:51:07.558 --> 00:51:10.421]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[00:51:10.421 --> 00:51:15.487]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[00:51:15.487 --> 00:51:17.850]  Signs include itching, pulling, tugging.
[00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.390]  I think so.
[00:51:37.685 --> 00:51:46.870]  Restulex will help ease and comfort your restless legs within 24 hours and will allow you to go back to your regular routine without discomfort or embarrassment.

[00:52:00.036 --> 00:52:04.038]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:04.645 --> 00:52:07.267]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.267 --> 00:52:14.274]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.838 --> 00:52:21.425]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.425 --> 00:52:23.407]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:25.910]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:36.882]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.486 --> 00:52:39.147]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.147 --> 00:52:41.008]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:41.008 --> 00:52:47.912]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.912 --> 00:52:56.176]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.176 --> 00:52:57.757]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:58.958]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.882 --> 00:53:11.473]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:53:11.473 --> 00:53:12.875]  Garden in a Can!

[00:54:47.716 --> 00:54:50.257]  The spirit of freedom is exploding.
[00:54:53.604 --> 00:54:58.749]  Well, I just met for the first time in person John McManus, president of the John Birch Society.
[00:54:58.749 --> 00:55:04.895]  He's going to be in studio coming up in about T-minus nine minutes.
[00:55:04.895 --> 00:55:07.217]  And we'll continue with phone calls throughout the show.
[00:55:07.217 --> 00:55:11.602]  We've got some other very compelling and informative guests coming up as well.
[00:55:17.827 --> 00:55:29.542]  And we will start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv at the 8 After when we start the second segment with Mr. McManus here in studio in Austin, Texas here at our operation headquarters.
[00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:34.962]  I wanted to tell you about a few of our sponsors first.
[00:55:34.962 --> 00:55:37.283]  One of them is HomeGain.
[00:55:37.283 --> 00:55:41.304]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great new sponsors, HomeGain.com.
[00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:47.686]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, and getting any real estate questions answered.

[00:55:54.368 --> 00:55:55.769]  All you need to do is type in there,

[00:56:19.207 --> 00:56:21.628]  Again, that's HomeGain.com.
[00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:25.269]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:56:25.269 --> 00:56:31.850]  Another one of the sponsors that has made this radio show possible, who we really appreciate, is Pepperspray.com.
[00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.171]  Incredibly low prices on all sorts of self-defense products.
[00:56:38.206 --> 00:56:40.528]  They've got great tasers.
[00:56:40.528 --> 00:56:44.650]  It's great for women who don't want to carry a firearm if somebody attacks you.
[00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:48.193]  Just a fabulous system for self-defense.
[00:56:48.193 --> 00:56:53.336]  They've got stun guns, animal repellents, home safety alarms, personal alarms.
[00:56:53.336 --> 00:56:54.917]  Pepperspray.com.
[00:56:54.917 --> 00:56:56.038]  Pepperspray.com.
[00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:59.860]  One word, and you're sending your daughters or sons off to college.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.302]  They've got all these restrictive Second Amendment rules.
[00:57:02.302 --> 00:57:02.982]  Bare minimum,
[00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:10.142]  Get them a taser, get them a stun gun, get them the big high-powered mace or pepper spray.
[00:57:10.142 --> 00:57:11.404]  Very, very effective.
[00:57:11.404 --> 00:57:13.628]  Pepperspray.com.
[00:57:13.628 --> 00:57:15.992]  Okay, we're going to start the
[00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:22.872]  Next hour, here in a moment, I'm going to go to a few more of your calls, John Brent, Brian Sam, and others.
[00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:30.818]  And then when we come back in the second segment of the next hour, we've got John McManus, president of the John Birch Society, in studio with us.
[00:57:30.818 --> 00:57:36.262]  So I'm extremely, extremely excited about that today.
[00:57:37.312 --> 00:57:48.159]  And then we've got Patrice O'Neill, well-known comedian on VH1, MTV, you name it, who's speaking out against Barack Obama and promoting the Obama deception all over the media.
[00:57:48.159 --> 00:57:53.182]  And so we really look forward to having Patrice O'Neill on the show with us today.
[00:57:53.182 --> 00:57:57.725]  And then we've got Brian Garish coming on to talk about Common Purpose, which is this
[00:57:59.486 --> 00:58:00.828]  Private government system.
[00:58:00.828 --> 00:58:10.779]  It's private groups, but they work with government power spying on the public and running 60 plus thousand domestic spies in the United Kingdom.
[00:58:10.779 --> 00:58:13.542]  So that is coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:20.602]  And then I've got Webster Tarpley, by the way, on the Sunday show.
[00:58:20.602 --> 00:58:25.385]  He's coming into town to film the second Obama film that we're making right now.
[00:58:25.385 --> 00:58:27.525]  I tell you, the Obama deception is hot!
[00:58:27.525 --> 00:58:29.286]  I said, Mr. McManus, it's been out for like two weeks.
[00:58:29.286 --> 00:58:30.327]  I said, let me give you a copy of it.
[00:58:30.327 --> 00:58:31.387]  He said, I've already seen it.
[00:58:31.387 --> 00:58:33.768]  Watched it on the plane on the way here.
[00:58:33.768 --> 00:58:36.329]  Somebody burned him a copy and gave it to him and watched it on his computer.
[00:58:36.329 --> 00:58:37.250]  Good job, folks.
[00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:38.610]  Keep getting it out.
[00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:39.311]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.311 --> 00:58:43.933]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.333 --> 00:58:52.393]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.393 --> 00:58:57.135]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.135 --> 00:59:00.096]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.096 --> 00:59:03.137]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.137 --> 00:59:07.858]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.038 --> 00:59:08.258]  We're good.
[00:59:25.399 --> 00:59:27.861]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:59:39.251 --> 00:59:39.892]  Take action today.
[00:59:39.892 --> 00:59:41.714]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.416 --> 00:59:55.818]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.818 --> 01:00:05.225]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.225 --> 01:00:06.526]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.526 --> 01:00:08.288]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.288 --> 01:00:10.049]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:11.630]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.391]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.175 --> 01:00:17.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:22.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.145 --> 01:00:27.892]  Well, the president of the John Birch Society, Mr. McManus, is going to be in studio with us in the next segment.
[01:00:27.892 --> 01:00:29.173]  He's doing a Texas tour.
[01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:33.447]  We'll tell you all about that and the locations he's going to be at, so you can attend those.
[01:00:33.447 --> 01:00:36.287]  Very informative.
[01:00:36.287 --> 01:00:41.369]  John Birch Society material, along with reading books by Carol Quigley and Elitist and others.
[01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:46.130]  And the book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, woke me up in high school.
[01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:51.931]  And then I went to college, and that was really a big wake-up, when everything that I'd read from the JBS and others became true.
[01:00:51.931 --> 01:00:55.432]  And they told me the Second Amendment was bad, America was bad, one world government was good.
[01:00:55.432 --> 01:00:59.993]  Then I'd turn on CNN and they'd say, crazy extremists say world government exists.
[01:01:01.274 --> 01:01:02.115]  And they're dangerous.
[01:01:02.115 --> 01:01:04.916]  But I was like, wait a minute, I was just taught that at college.
[01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:07.138]  So, how does it not exist?
[01:01:07.138 --> 01:01:09.339]  And down the rabbit hole I went.
[01:01:09.339 --> 01:01:16.143]  So, great materials they put out and we're honored to have him here with us at the Central Texas headquarters.
[01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:18.005]  Okay, let's go to a few calls here.
[01:01:18.005 --> 01:01:20.166]  Let's talk to John in South Carolina.
[01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:21.027]  John, you're on the air.
[01:01:21.027 --> 01:01:23.888]  Welcome.
[01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.309]  Alex, how you doing today?
[01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.649]  Good, sir.
[01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:26.250]  What's on your mind?
[01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:34.376]  Well, Alex, I gotta say, I'm a little bit new to all of this, and I'm trying to wake up some people in my area.
[01:01:34.376 --> 01:01:41.422]  As you just said, I'm in South Carolina, and I gotta say, I'm not getting a great response.
[01:01:41.422 --> 01:01:46.266]  People really don't want to hear anything other than what they're used to hearing.
[01:01:46.266 --> 01:01:50.350]  Well, you just heard the last caller say everybody's waking up, but I always get this.
[01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:52.071]  Some groups wake up, other groups don't.
[01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:53.733]  Are you trying to wake up your family, mainly?
[01:01:54.554 --> 01:01:57.415]  Well, I started with my wife.
[01:01:57.415 --> 01:01:58.716]  I finally got her over.
[01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:00.717]  Oh, I let her watch Endgame.
[01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.338]  See, I knew that.
[01:02:01.338 --> 01:02:03.919]  Family is the hardest group to wake up.
[01:02:03.919 --> 01:02:06.380]  Any salesman will tell you that, but go ahead.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:23.549]  I have to say, in South Carolina, we pretty much are in the Bible Belt, and people are very conservative and very set in their ways, and even some of my friends, which I consider to be, I don't know, we were the freaks in high school, so, you know, you can take what you want from that.
[01:02:24.993 --> 01:02:38.661]  Even they have a hard time swallowing a lot of this, even when I show them the Obama deception, Endgame, Terror Storm, and the facts are, I mean, they're right there in your face, black and white.
[01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:39.822]  They just don't want to hear it.
[01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:52.309]  It's almost like these people, who I consider to be critically thinking, logical people, as soon as they are faced with something scary, and let's face it, this is a scary thing, when they're faced with something scary,
[01:02:53.226 --> 01:02:54.927]  Their logic goes out of the window.
[01:02:54.927 --> 01:03:02.150]  But it's going to get a lot more scary if the New World Order is successful in being set up.
[01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:09.593]  This type of denial is going to allow them to fully bankrupt this country and socialize it under the control of the foreign banks.
[01:03:09.593 --> 01:03:18.657]  And the fact is, the fact that we are under a fiat economic system, that should anger them enough right there.
[01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:24.605]  There's so much documentation on that that's completely irrefutable.
[01:03:24.605 --> 01:03:28.427]  And even that doesn't seem to have an effect on them.
[01:03:28.427 --> 01:03:34.452]  And my question to you, sir, is who can we turn to in government?
[01:03:34.452 --> 01:03:35.913]  Or is there no one?
[01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:37.354]  Is the Libertarian Party
[01:03:38.121 --> 01:03:44.146]  Is that a viable alternative or is that just yet a third side of the same coin?
[01:03:44.146 --> 01:03:46.407]  I don't think so.
[01:03:46.407 --> 01:03:56.014]  Certainly building a new populist party that's based on the ideas of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, our system of government,
[01:03:56.915 --> 01:04:03.879]  is the key, but five percent of the nation won the war against the British, that long eight-year war.
[01:04:03.879 --> 01:04:05.320]  And so, move on.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.342]  If people don't want to hear the truth, move on to those that do want to hear it.
[01:04:09.342 --> 01:04:15.206]  Move out into other circles, go to Libertarian Party meetings, and educate them further.
[01:04:15.206 --> 01:04:22.310]  That's where you'll find like-minded people, or the John Birch Society, get involved with that, or get involved in the Constitution Party, get involved
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.652]  Go to liberal environmental meetings.
[01:04:25.652 --> 01:04:27.113]  Wake them up.
[01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.594]  Go to city council meetings.
[01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:32.216]  Cover news every week during citizens' communication.
[01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.017]  Go spend three minutes talking to them.
[01:04:34.017 --> 01:04:37.280]  Just start engaging and you'll find a lot of like-minded people.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.761]  But I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:39.821]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:39.821 --> 01:04:46.806]  We're going to have a quick break now and come back with Mr. McManus, John McManus, president of the John Birch Society in the studio.
[01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:48.207]  He's got a Texas tour going.
[01:04:48.207 --> 01:04:49.448]  You'll have a chance to hear him speak.
[01:04:49.448 --> 01:04:51.329]  You'll find out how straight ahead.
[01:04:51.329 --> 01:04:52.210]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:55.698]  And PrisonPlanet.com are our websites.
[01:04:55.698 --> 01:04:56.260]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.885 --> 01:05:06.269]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:14.836]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:05:14.836 --> 01:05:18.419]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:21.641]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:24.143]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[01:05:24.143 --> 01:05:27.126]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[01:06:01.316 --> 01:06:07.139]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.139 --> 01:06:14.123]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.685 --> 01:06:21.269]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.250]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.751]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:37.338]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.338 --> 01:06:38.999]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:38.999 --> 01:06:40.360]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:40.862 --> 01:06:47.768]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.768 --> 01:06:56.034]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.034 --> 01:06:57.615]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.615 --> 01:07:00.658]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.658 --> 01:07:05.802]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file
[01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:08.815]  I don't think so.
[01:07:28.018 --> 01:07:28.478]  We're good to go.
[01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:50.196]  Call 718-615-0123.
[01:07:50.196 --> 01:07:54.117]  That's 718-615-0123.

[01:08:00.739 --> 01:08:06.141]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:08.422]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.553 --> 01:08:18.363]  We are now simulcasting the radio show for the next two hours and 52 minutes.
[01:08:20.515 --> 01:08:23.235]  At PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:23.235 --> 01:08:27.656]  Then we have John McManus here in studio with us.
[01:08:27.656 --> 01:08:30.697]  I am very, very excited about that.
[01:08:30.697 --> 01:08:35.498]  The president of the John Birch Society in studio with us until, I think, five after next hour.
[01:08:35.498 --> 01:08:37.478]  So we'll get a full hour on air with him.
[01:08:37.478 --> 01:08:39.938]  Then we've got some other interesting guests coming on.
[01:08:39.938 --> 01:08:43.539]  Patrice O'Neill is an African-American popular comedian.
[01:08:43.539 --> 01:08:48.140]  He's been criticizing Obama and promoting the Obama deception when he goes on national media outlets.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.523]  So we'll see how that goes for his career, but that is coming up.
[01:08:52.523 --> 01:09:00.848]  You know, there's so much I'd like to talk to you about, and it's great that you were coming through Texas on this tour, and that somebody had the idea that we should contact you and have you here.
[01:09:00.848 --> 01:09:11.496]  I've had you on a few times over the phone, but Mr. McManus, it is just great to meet you in person, and I appreciate your tireless work at the John Birch Society over the last 40 years.
[01:09:11.496 --> 01:09:14.418]  Thank you, it's my pleasure.
[01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:17.160]  I tell people all the time I wouldn't miss this fight for anything.
[01:09:18.106 --> 01:09:21.408]  Boy, I tell you, everything you guys talked about has unfortunately come true.
[01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:28.493]  Talk a little bit about yourself, your 40-plus years there, what the John Birch Society is for folks that don't know, and then the tour.
[01:09:28.493 --> 01:09:32.415]  Let's get that out of the way now, because folks want to write this down and find out where they can come hear you speak.
[01:09:32.415 --> 01:09:36.758]  Excellent speaker, very informative, and it's all documented, the issues you cover.
[01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:39.800]  And then let's get into what the New World Order is and what we're facing.
[01:09:40.646 --> 01:09:51.655]  Well, on a personal level, I did three years in the Marine Corps after college as a lieutenant, and then I was an electronics engineer, and I joined the Society as a local member in the early 60s.
[01:09:51.655 --> 01:09:55.038]  In 1964, they asked me to take a staff position.
[01:09:55.038 --> 01:09:57.200]  Uh, excuse me, it was 66.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.703]  So I've been on the staff of the Birch Society for 43 years.
[01:10:00.703 --> 01:10:06.648]  I worked alongside Robert Welsh as his public relations director all during the 70s and into the 80s until he passed away in 1985.
[01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.292]  In 1991, they named me president.
[01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:19.137]  I'm the head of the society in one respect, but we have a CEO also, a fellow named Art Thompson, and we work very closely together.
[01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:22.764]  So I've been everything you could imagine in the Birch Society.
[01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:28.207]  I've been a writer and a speaker and a publicist and a radio and television guy.
[01:10:28.207 --> 01:10:30.569]  I've written five books.
[01:10:30.569 --> 01:10:38.093]  I've done everything you could expect of somebody as long as I've been in the Birch Society and it's been an absolute delight.
[01:10:38.093 --> 01:10:40.534]  I wouldn't, as I said, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:58.385]  And it was the John Birch Society that really gets the credit first, and that's why he got demonized in a big way, explaining, no, they control both parties, it's a foreign cartel, here's their own documents, they want a bank of the world that will regulate all the nation states.
[01:10:58.385 --> 01:11:03.306]  Now, that's Time Magazine Newsweek, the Financial Times of London, and now for world government.
[01:11:03.906 --> 01:11:08.210]  The very people engineering the economic collapse are openly announcing world government.
[01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:11.612]  I guess you guys aren't so kooky after all for researching the... Oh, not at all.
[01:11:11.612 --> 01:11:18.078]  You know, I wrote a book in 1993 called Financial Terrorism, Hijacking America Under the Threat of Bankruptcy.
[01:11:18.078 --> 01:11:26.564]  And in my book in 93, I laid out many, many statements of prominent people who were saying, well, what we need is world government.
[01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:28.266]  What we gotta have is world government.
[01:11:28.866 --> 01:11:37.511]  And, uh, I've gotten calls from people, a couple of calling show people, who said that they've just simply come across my book recently and, and I'm a prophet, they said.
[01:11:37.511 --> 01:11:38.972]  No, I'm not a prophet at all.
[01:11:38.972 --> 01:11:41.073]  I said, all I did was some homework.
[01:11:41.073 --> 01:11:42.775]  And I did what Ravel Welch always said.
[01:11:42.775 --> 01:11:44.355]  He said, just project the lines.
[01:11:44.355 --> 01:11:48.238]  If you project the lines, you can arrive at the conclusions that are coming.
[01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:56.283]  That's what we do in the Birch Society and, uh, I hate to say it, but we predicted all of what's happening here in the economic malaise that our country's involved in.
[01:11:57.196 --> 01:11:58.636]  And it sure is a malaise.
[01:11:58.636 --> 01:12:11.619]  You know, one of the things I quote, you'd be interested in this, when Paul Volcker was named to be the head of the Federal Reserve back in 1979, he testified before the U.S.
[01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:18.681]  Senate, and he said, the standard of living of the average American has to come down, I don't think you can escape that.
[01:12:18.681 --> 01:12:25.143]  And you've got to ask yourself, why would any American want the standard of living of the average American to come down?
[01:12:25.143 --> 01:12:26.183]  And the answer's very simple.
[01:12:26.952 --> 01:12:31.374]  If the United States is way up high and the rest of the world is down here, you've got to bring the U.S.
[01:12:31.374 --> 01:12:36.717]  down and bring the others up so that we can be comfortably merged into the New World Order.
[01:12:36.717 --> 01:12:38.638]  And that's what Volcker said.
[01:12:38.638 --> 01:12:39.978]  He said that before the U.S.
[01:12:39.978 --> 01:12:40.339]  Senate.
[01:12:40.339 --> 01:12:41.399]  They didn't challenge him.
[01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:43.160]  They said, fine, you're approved.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.501]  You go lead the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:49.169]  And he's a bad man in my view, and now he's back in the White House.
[01:12:49.169 --> 01:12:51.070]  Wonderful.
[01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:55.634]  Again, where do you have to be later?
[01:12:55.634 --> 01:12:59.457]  Because I don't think the 40 minutes of airtime we're going to have is enough.
[01:12:59.457 --> 01:13:07.043]  Perhaps I can give you 15 minutes in the next hour and we can move the next guest back, because we could talk for a whole hour just about your book and their own documents.
[01:13:07.043 --> 01:13:11.927]  And you're right, back in the early 90s, you guys knew what their battle plan was even then, and the proof's in the pudding.
[01:13:11.927 --> 01:13:13.989]  You've been proven correct, specifically
[01:13:14.309 --> 01:13:15.670]  Start over in more detail.
[01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:16.551]  Go over your book.
[01:13:16.551 --> 01:13:17.692]  How they operate.
[01:13:17.692 --> 01:13:24.077]  How they're on record, writing hundreds of books themselves, thousands of white papers, admitting their dastardly deeds.
[01:13:24.077 --> 01:13:34.065]  Well, I quoted Brzezinski, and I quoted Kissinger, and I quoted Volker, and I quoted Bergsten, the head of the economic thing down there in Washington, and all these people.
[01:13:34.065 --> 01:13:36.047]  They were all saying the same thing.
[01:13:36.047 --> 01:13:41.451]  And I don't know why it is that back then only the Birch Society was able to say, hey, put this all together.
[01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:42.672]  Look, this is where they're heading.
[01:13:43.433 --> 01:13:45.534]  They want world government.
[01:13:45.534 --> 01:13:52.596]  Now, one of the points that I like to make, and why the Birch Society became so controversial, is that we say it's a conspiracy.
[01:13:52.596 --> 01:13:56.938]  We say, look, these people don't have an ideology, they're part of a conspiracy.
[01:13:56.938 --> 01:13:58.999]  They don't believe in anything other than power.
[01:13:59.959 --> 01:14:01.681]  They don't believe in the Communist Manifesto.
[01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:03.302]  They don't believe in the Constitution.
[01:14:03.302 --> 01:14:04.483]  They don't believe in Scripture.
[01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:05.824]  They don't believe in anything.
[01:14:05.824 --> 01:14:07.145]  They only want power.
[01:14:07.145 --> 01:14:13.310]  And it's a devilish determination to take power over mankind.
[01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:16.293]  One of the ways of doing that is economically.
[01:14:16.293 --> 01:14:21.096]  It was Meyer Anschel Rothschild, the founder of the famous Rothschild Banking Empire.
[01:14:21.096 --> 01:14:21.397]  He said,
[01:14:22.475 --> 01:14:26.017]  Give me control of a nation's money, I care not who makes the laws.
[01:14:26.017 --> 01:14:30.419]  Because that person will make the laws as I want them made.
[01:14:30.419 --> 01:14:31.920]  And that's where we are.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.340]  So they have control of the money now.
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.961]  The Federal Reserve?
[01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:37.002]  Federal Reserve has to go.
[01:14:37.002 --> 01:14:40.864]  And happily, there's a bill in Congress now, H.R.
[01:14:40.864 --> 01:14:42.125]  833, to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:14:42.921 --> 01:14:49.268]  I would like everybody who's listening to write to your congressman and say, please co-sponsor H.R.
[01:14:49.268 --> 01:14:49.949]  833.
[01:14:49.949 --> 01:14:53.533]  And if that happens, the bill is a responsible thing.
[01:14:53.533 --> 01:14:59.279]  It says from the enactment of this bill, one year, the Federal Reserve shall stand abolished.
[01:14:59.279 --> 01:15:01.021]  In other words, it's not going to be an overnight thing.
[01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:02.843]  It's a responsible piece of legislation.
[01:15:03.484 --> 01:15:04.505]  Glad to see it.
[01:15:04.505 --> 01:15:07.747]  Well, Ron Paul's got another bill to just audit the thing.
[01:15:07.747 --> 01:15:08.828]  Yeah, it's never been audited.
[01:15:08.828 --> 01:15:09.749]  Can you speak to that fact?
[01:15:09.749 --> 01:15:16.374]  And then even Senator Sanders, just a few weeks ago, said to Bernanke, he said, where's the trillions of dollars?
[01:15:16.374 --> 01:15:17.675]  And Bernanke said, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:15:17.675 --> 01:15:20.617]  No, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:24.080]  Most Americans have no idea that the Federal Reserve is a private agency.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.461]  It's not a government agency.
[01:15:25.461 --> 01:15:26.902]  And that's amazing.
[01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:28.103]  You go to Washington D.C.
[01:15:28.103 --> 01:15:31.085]  and you pull out that big phone book they have, and they have blue pages for all the
[01:15:32.026 --> 01:15:35.107]  Federal agencies, and the Federal Reserve's not there.
[01:15:35.107 --> 01:15:38.688]  It's not a federal agency, and they take dictation from no one.
[01:15:38.688 --> 01:15:43.710]  They don't answer the questions they don't want to answer, as you just mentioned, and on and on you go.
[01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:47.891]  Now, the Fed has never been audited, and I had an interesting thing happen to me.
[01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:50.612]  I said that in a speech about a year ago.
[01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:54.693]  A guy wrote me a letter, and he sent me a little newspaper clipping talking about the Fed had been audited.
[01:15:55.526 --> 01:16:02.690]  And I did some investigation and I found out what they'd audited was the number of desks and the number of pencils and the number of file cabinets and so on.
[01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:08.513]  They didn't go into any of the financial end of it and so effectively the Fed has still never been audited.
[01:16:08.513 --> 01:16:18.078]  Ron Paul has a bill and that one's HR 1207 to audit the Fed and I understand that there's a lot of people jumping aboard co-signing this one.
[01:16:18.078 --> 01:16:22.060]  They're up to about something like 35 co-signers or co-sponsors.
[01:16:22.694 --> 01:16:23.735]  That's good.
[01:16:23.735 --> 01:16:25.397]  I would love to see an audit of the Fed.
[01:16:25.397 --> 01:16:30.202]  I'd like to know what they've got for wealth and what they do with it and how they operate and so forth.
[01:16:30.202 --> 01:16:31.343]  But we don't know.
[01:16:31.343 --> 01:16:35.307]  We don't know because it's a private agency and they thumb their nose at government.
[01:16:35.307 --> 01:16:41.414]  Did you see the clip on the NewsHour with former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan?
[01:16:43.476 --> 01:16:52.920]  He said, look, the President, the Legislative, the Congress, no one can even question us or look at us, because he was asked, what's your relationship to the government?
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.260]  And he said, there is none.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.942]  We are a, quote, separate agency and are non-reviewable.
[01:16:58.942 --> 01:17:00.823]  So, I mean, we know our Constitution.
[01:17:00.823 --> 01:17:01.523]  We know our Bill of Rights.
[01:17:01.523 --> 01:17:02.703]  We know the separation of powers.
[01:17:02.703 --> 01:17:07.025]  It's all three branches reviewing each other, tying down dominant men.
[01:17:07.025 --> 01:17:08.826]  And just here is this private Federal Reserve
[01:17:09.446 --> 01:17:10.506]  I mean this is just tyranny.
[01:17:26.368 --> 01:17:27.509]  It's tyranny.
[01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:28.130]  Absolutely.
[01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:29.691]  It's absolutely wrong.
[01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:33.094]  Now, you know, the idea for it came from the Communist Manifesto.
[01:17:33.094 --> 01:17:34.015]  Plank No.
[01:17:34.015 --> 01:17:34.676]  5.
[01:17:34.676 --> 01:17:40.281]  And that's the Communist Manifesto says a central bank with state control and so on.
[01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:42.964]  And we've gone one worse than Karl Marx.
[01:17:42.964 --> 01:17:44.926]  We've out-Marxed Marx.
[01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:48.909]  He said in the hands of the state, we say, no, it's a private agency.
[01:17:48.909 --> 01:17:51.332]  Ours is worse than what Karl Marx even wanted.
[01:17:51.852 --> 01:18:02.661]  But as you pioneered exposing at the JBS, and I've seen the government documents and congressional testimony, it was really the big central banks to con the public into slavery, the people's paradise, that finance communism.
[01:18:02.661 --> 01:18:10.308]  So of course you're going to have public education, and of course you're going to have a central bank, and of course you're going to have federal control.
[01:18:10.308 --> 01:18:18.935]  All the things in that Communist Manifesto, that's what the governments of the world follow when they're under the control of the private banks, and their enemy is the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:18:18.935 --> 01:18:19.436]  Absolutely.
[01:18:19.856 --> 01:18:25.858]  The 10 planks of the Communist Manifesto all are partially or fully in place in the United States today.
[01:18:25.858 --> 01:18:27.679]  It all happened in the 20th century.
[01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:31.380]  Number 10, free education for all children in the government schools.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:38.063]  And I like to tell my audience, I said, now, if the government's going to control the schools, do you think they're going to teach anything that will impact government power?
[01:18:38.903 --> 01:18:40.425]  The answer is no.
[01:18:40.425 --> 01:18:44.050]  I say, if a Hindu starts a school, is he going to teach Lutheranism?
[01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:44.851]  No.
[01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:53.902]  If a government starts a school, they're going to teach government power and want government power to be preached and taught and not impacted by the schools they control.
[01:18:53.902 --> 01:18:55.945]  Very simple.
[01:18:55.945 --> 01:18:56.546]  One of the great
[01:18:57.714 --> 01:19:01.736]  Reasons for hope in our country is so many people are going to homeschooling.
[01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:03.237]  And the more of that, the better.
[01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:05.258]  But now the feds are moving to try to restrict that.
[01:19:05.258 --> 01:19:14.503]  Well, they did try to restrict it, and there were some states where they actually grabbed children out of the homes and impounded them and so forth, but members of the Birch Society stopped that.
[01:19:14.503 --> 01:19:16.985]  One of the worst cases was in Idaho of all places.
[01:19:17.725 --> 01:19:24.887]  And Virginia was another key place, and in both places, our people, our Birch Society people, got in there and made sure that this didn't happen.
[01:19:24.887 --> 01:19:35.110]  Now, so, homeschool is pretty much allowed today, but the tyranny involved in it is all the people who are homeschooling still have to pay taxes to support the schools that they won't send their kids to.
[01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.690]  Yeah, slavery.
[01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:40.712]  We'll take last year, the state court in California ruled that the state owns the children.
[01:19:40.712 --> 01:19:42.112]  Now, that got struck down.
[01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:42.793]  That got struck down.
[01:19:42.793 --> 01:19:44.613]  But that shows the mindset.
[01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:44.973]  Right.
[01:19:44.973 --> 01:19:46.954]  I mean... It got struck down for a time.
[01:19:47.914 --> 01:19:48.475]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:48.475 --> 01:19:52.739]  But they're trying to say, you have the children, we the state, take them over.
[01:19:52.739 --> 01:19:55.742]  John McManus, president of the John Birch Society is in studio.
[01:19:55.742 --> 01:19:57.464]  This is great.
[01:19:57.464 --> 01:19:58.465]  It's wonderful to have you, sir.
[01:19:58.465 --> 01:19:59.026]  My pleasure.
[01:20:01.818 --> 01:20:08.001]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:14.423]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:20:14.423 --> 01:20:20.166]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:22.246]  Starve or surrender.
[01:20:22.246 --> 01:20:26.928]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:20:26.928 --> 01:20:27.829]  What then?
[01:20:30.524 --> 01:20:33.605]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:20:33.605 --> 01:20:37.947]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[01:20:37.947 --> 01:20:40.809]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[01:21:01.604 --> 01:21:04.047]  Peter Kratschnabel here from Midas Resources.
[01:21:04.047 --> 01:21:07.070]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:09.533]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[01:21:09.533 --> 01:21:11.976]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[01:21:11.976 --> 01:21:14.458]  Wall Street and continuous freefall?
[01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:17.302]  Scandal after scandal with hedge fund companies?
[01:21:17.302 --> 01:21:22.167]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[01:21:22.699 --> 01:21:25.761]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[01:21:25.761 --> 01:21:34.688]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[01:21:34.688 --> 01:21:38.251]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:41.273]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:21:41.273 --> 01:21:44.116]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:21:51.482 --> 01:21:53.924]  Why you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:21:53.924 --> 01:22:01.472]  That is 1-800-686-2237 extension 108.
[01:22:01.472 --> 01:22:06.697]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.481 --> 01:22:13.365]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.365 --> 01:22:19.869]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.869 --> 01:22:21.850]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:24.312]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:24.312 --> 01:22:35.199]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:39.147]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.147 --> 01:22:41.008]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:41.008 --> 01:22:47.930]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:57.754 --> 01:22:58.955]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.652 --> 01:23:04.175]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:23:04.175 --> 01:23:06.097]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:23:06.097 --> 01:23:11.661]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:23:11.661 --> 01:23:19.688]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[01:23:52.118 --> 01:23:53.419]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[01:24:14.994 --> 01:24:17.996]  We've got the president of the John Birch Society here on a Texas tour.
[01:24:17.996 --> 01:24:23.641]  Before we run out of time, and he will be here 15 minutes to the next hour, tell us about the speaking dates.
[01:24:23.641 --> 01:24:29.445]  You've already done some, but you have left in Texas, and the hotels those are being held at for folks that want to come learn more.
[01:24:29.445 --> 01:24:36.191]  Well, tonight I'll be in San Antonio at the Embassy Suites, and I think that's on the north side of town.
[01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:41.135]  And then Friday night I'll be at the Richardson Civic Center in Richardson, Texas, right outside Dallas.
[01:24:41.949 --> 01:24:48.734]  And in about a month I come back and I'm going to speak in Lubbock and Midland and Amarillo.
[01:24:48.734 --> 01:24:50.676]  But I don't know where.
[01:24:50.676 --> 01:24:55.940]  But you can find that out by going to jbs.org and the information's all there.
[01:24:56.448 --> 01:25:00.051]  They can just go to JBS events and see where the president's speaking.
[01:25:00.051 --> 01:25:00.872]  Correct.
[01:25:00.872 --> 01:25:05.676]  And then you're pretty much a year around doing speaking engagements.
[01:25:05.676 --> 01:25:11.220]  So there's, no matter where you are in the country, throughout the year you generally get to close to where folks are at.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.021]  That's right.
[01:25:12.021 --> 01:25:13.222]  I do a lot of traveling.
[01:25:13.222 --> 01:25:16.144]  My wife's favorite phrase to me is, have a nice trip.
[01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.306]  Yeah, that's what my wife says to me.
[01:25:18.306 --> 01:25:21.388]  She says, bye, see ya.
[01:25:21.388 --> 01:25:22.089]  Have a nice trip.
[01:25:23.763 --> 01:25:36.076]  You know, we do sacrifice seeing our families as much as we'd like, which is the most important thing in the world, because I know I have a passion, I know you have a passion, there's so much evidence, there's so much globalist takeover going on.
[01:25:36.076 --> 01:25:41.501]  I mean, people think sometimes I exaggerate, it's the opposite, there's too much evidence to cover it all.
[01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:44.765]  Well, there certainly is enough evidence for anybody who wants to take the time to look.
[01:25:45.663 --> 01:25:47.365]  And so then what do you do?
[01:25:47.365 --> 01:25:51.250]  You find out that your country is being converted into a socialist system?
[01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:54.654]  Even Newsweek Magazine said we are all socialists now.
[01:25:54.654 --> 01:25:56.216]  Oh, there it is, yeah.
[01:25:56.216 --> 01:25:59.119]  And we've been saying that for a long, long time.
[01:25:59.119 --> 01:26:00.221]  What is socialism?
[01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:03.044]  Socialism is control by government.
[01:26:03.044 --> 01:26:03.344]  Simple.
[01:26:04.365 --> 01:26:08.029]  It's economic control, but of course if you have economic control, it follows.
[01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:15.495]  And if you don't like what's happening with the economic control, you start a Gestapo, you start a police state, you can do all kinds of things.
[01:26:15.495 --> 01:26:17.557]  And that's what we face.
[01:26:17.557 --> 01:26:29.008]  Now, one of the things that I like to say is that you go down to Washington today and you talk to Senator, Congressman, President, anybody else, they say, look, we're in an economic downturn and government has to do something.
[01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:30.810]  No.
[01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:32.491]  The opposite is what needs to be done.
[01:26:32.491 --> 01:26:34.391]  Government has to undo things.
[01:26:34.391 --> 01:26:39.012]  They have to undo all kinds of things they never should have started in the first place.
[01:26:39.012 --> 01:26:49.795]  Obama has announced that there's going to be a $1.75 trillion deficit this fiscal year, and a day after he announced that, he announced a $51 billion foreign aid program.
[01:26:50.785 --> 01:26:59.595]  Now I say, if you go to a fourth grader and you ask him if you're heavily in debt, should you give away money, the fourth grader would say, no, of course not!
[01:26:59.595 --> 01:27:02.138]  And I think sometimes we need fourth graders in Congress.
[01:27:03.396 --> 01:27:06.177]  Yeah, the common sense isn't there, but they know what they're doing.
[01:27:06.177 --> 01:27:07.558]  They use our money against us.
[01:27:07.558 --> 01:27:15.322]  Now, you mentioned this earlier, but it's key that you and others are on record laying out their blueprint.
[01:27:15.322 --> 01:27:17.163]  You weren't looking into a crystal ball.
[01:27:17.163 --> 01:27:18.384]  You were studying their own documents.
[01:27:18.384 --> 01:27:23.426]  Tell us about your book in the early 90s, dealing with economic terrorism, because that's what they're doing now.
[01:27:23.426 --> 01:27:24.587]  They engineer the crisis.
[01:27:25.467 --> 01:27:32.471]  They bring it in, they say, give us the banker bailout, which is really a banker takeover, or there'll be a depression, then things get worse.
[01:27:32.471 --> 01:27:37.253]  They say, okay, give us stimulus packages, give us more banker control, or there'll be a depression.
[01:27:37.253 --> 01:27:39.795]  Then we give them more control, and the same thing over and over again.
[01:27:39.795 --> 01:27:44.257]  Break down specifically your book and your predictions and what we're now in the process of seeing.
[01:27:44.457 --> 01:27:51.780]  Well, the book did a lot of research about what is money and what was the Constitution's position regarding money.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:56.521]  And then one chapter is called, Karl Marx would have loved the Fed.
[01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:58.002]  Get into all of that.
[01:27:58.002 --> 01:27:58.982]  How do we get out of it?
[01:27:58.982 --> 01:28:06.685]  And we got out of it, at the end of the book, I started talking about the fact that government ought to sell a lot of its holdings.
[01:28:06.685 --> 01:28:12.847]  If 13 western states, more than 50% of it is owned by the federal government, then they ought to sell it.
[01:28:13.627 --> 01:28:21.210]  Sell the land, they can start paying off the national debt, but the national debt is going so far out of sight today, it's a little bit hard to even imagine.
[01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.652]  You wonder if they're ever going to be able to pay the national debt.
[01:28:24.652 --> 01:28:26.733]  Now, my book is called Financial Terrorism.
[01:28:26.733 --> 01:28:28.733]  Unfortunately, it's out of print.
[01:28:28.733 --> 01:28:37.557]  I went through two printings, but now people are coming back and some people have dragged it out and re-read it, said it's more applicable today than it was when I wrote it in 1993.
[01:28:37.557 --> 01:28:40.158]  So, yeah, we're in favor of that.
[01:28:43.226 --> 01:28:56.362]  One of the things I'm making, one of the points I'm making in my speech is to contrast, it's really not contrast as much as it is compare, what happened in Japan way back in the late 80s and into the early 90s.
[01:28:56.362 --> 01:28:58.444]  During the late 80s Japan was boomtown.
[01:28:59.305 --> 01:29:07.029]  Japan was piling up all kinds of wealth, and Japan was going to overtake everybody, and there was all kinds of information about this all over the place.
[01:29:07.029 --> 01:29:10.530]  In fact, Japan, even at that point, bought Rockefeller Center.
[01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:12.191]  I don't know if you remember that.
[01:29:12.191 --> 01:29:15.513]  They had to pay it back, they had to give it back, sell it back afterwards.
[01:29:15.513 --> 01:29:18.634]  But in 1992, the bubble burst!
[01:29:18.634 --> 01:29:21.636]  And housing prices went down 80%.
[01:29:21.636 --> 01:29:24.897]  And the Nikkei Stock Exchange went down two-thirds.
[01:29:24.897 --> 01:29:26.378]  So what did the government do in Japan?
[01:29:27.554 --> 01:29:30.436]  They did exactly what we are doing in America.
[01:29:30.436 --> 01:29:30.857]  Stay there.
[01:29:30.857 --> 01:29:33.439]  We're going to come back, long segment, plenty of time to go over this.
[01:29:33.439 --> 01:29:35.560]  Then I want to throw out some of the current policies.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:41.625]  National Compulsory Service, open borders, restrictions on the Second Amendment.
[01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:45.668]  The establishment is clearly making its biggest move ever against freedom.
[01:29:45.668 --> 01:29:49.851]  Instead of going incrementally, they've launched the Blitzkrieg attack on freedom.
[01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.933]  John McManus, president of the JBS, our guest.
[01:29:51.933 --> 01:29:52.894]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.894 --> 01:29:54.395]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.390 --> 01:30:01.273]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.273 --> 01:30:02.174]  Attention gardeners!
[01:30:02.174 --> 01:30:04.775]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:30:04.775 --> 01:30:09.298]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:30:09.298 --> 01:30:17.502]  It's called Proto-Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:30:17.502 --> 01:30:20.324]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:30:20.609 --> 01:30:28.251]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:30:28.251 --> 01:30:34.053]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:30:34.053 --> 01:30:39.895]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:30:39.895 --> 01:30:43.136]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:30:43.436 --> 01:30:47.037]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:30:47.037 --> 01:30:52.098]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:30:52.098 --> 01:30:55.019]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:30:55.019 --> 01:30:55.319]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:55.319 --> 01:30:56.739]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:07.336]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.336 --> 01:31:14.351]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.921 --> 01:31:21.506]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.506 --> 01:31:23.488]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.488 --> 01:31:25.990]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:36.919]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.552 --> 01:31:39.233]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.233 --> 01:31:41.075]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:41.075 --> 01:31:48.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.267 --> 01:31:57.848]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.848 --> 01:31:59.029]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.644 --> 01:32:04.385]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:08.846]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[01:32:08.846 --> 01:32:13.148]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[01:32:13.148 --> 01:32:15.329]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:20.130]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:27.033]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[01:32:27.033 --> 01:32:28.233]  One Florida customer says,
[01:32:28.715 --> 01:32:37.297]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[01:32:37.297 --> 01:32:41.959]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[01:32:41.959 --> 01:32:45.299]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.

[01:33:05.433 --> 01:33:10.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Obama Deception is on sale now on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:21.516]  Mr. McManus, President of the John Birch Society, I tried to give you a copy of the Obama Deception when you got here, but somebody had gotten you one of the internet burn copies, which we appreciate, but we've given you a copy now.
[01:33:21.516 --> 01:33:28.317]  I don't really know what your review of it is, so this will be virgin ground for me here, but what is your take on the Obama Deception?
[01:33:28.317 --> 01:33:30.117]  Well, there's a lot of good information in there.
[01:33:30.117 --> 01:33:32.458]  There's a lot of information the American people need to know.
[01:33:32.458 --> 01:33:34.298]  I don't doubt that a bit.
[01:33:35.458 --> 01:33:50.991]  I watched it on a little thing I have on a plane ride, and I watched it on that, and of course I wasn't taking notes or anything, I was just... So I want to go back and study it some more, but there's an awful lot in there that the American people need to know about the man who is now in the White House.
[01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:54.101]  Well, what we attempt to do is what you guys have always done.
[01:33:54.101 --> 01:33:57.262]  Can we stop looking at the little puppets right here?
[01:33:57.262 --> 01:33:59.643]  Can we look past them to the puppet master?
[01:33:59.643 --> 01:34:07.564]  Finish up your story about financial terrorism, the Japan... Well, what happened in Japan, it's really stunning.
[01:34:07.564 --> 01:34:10.885]  Japan, their bubble burst in 1992.
[01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:13.725]  And so the government decided that it had to do something.
[01:34:13.725 --> 01:34:14.645]  So what did it do?
[01:34:14.645 --> 01:34:16.826]  Well, first thing it did was it printed a lot more money.
[01:34:17.586 --> 01:34:23.537]  Now, keep in mind that what happened in Japan is what is being done now to treat a similar problem here in our country.
[01:34:24.366 --> 01:34:26.367]  They nationalized some industries.
[01:34:26.367 --> 01:34:30.509]  They gave all kinds of stimulus packages.
[01:34:30.509 --> 01:34:36.652]  They did everything we're doing here in America, and 17 years later, they're still in their recession.
[01:34:36.652 --> 01:34:46.756]  And you go back to the Great Depression and go to the 30s, and you can see that everything that was done by Hoover and then by Roosevelt, who tripled what Hoover had been doing, it kept us in the Depression.
[01:34:46.756 --> 01:34:48.737]  It didn't get us out of the Depression.
[01:34:48.737 --> 01:34:50.418]  And this is what's happening here today.
[01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:53.999]  Uh, everything that government is doing is wrong.
[01:34:53.999 --> 01:34:55.460]  They should not do it.
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:03.704]  And one of the things that we like to say, a principle of the free enterprise system, is that, that governments, or organizations that fail should be allowed to fail.
[01:35:04.554 --> 01:35:12.700]  And why should the American people bail out AIG and Citibank and some corporations and automobile producers and so forth?
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:15.843]  Agencies and governments shouldn't be doing that.
[01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:19.166]  Well, more than just that, though, from our perspective they failed.
[01:35:19.166 --> 01:35:23.049]  From our perspective, they're screwing up and it's wrong.
[01:35:23.049 --> 01:35:33.417]  But if you, as you know, read the Globalist documents, the Club of Rome, CFR, Trilateral Commission, they build these bubbles, get everybody overextended in debt and then implode them to get
[01:35:33.917 --> 01:35:38.199]  More power and control, as government did during the Depression, as is what's happening in Japan.
[01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:47.422]  So can you specifically speak to the fact, and give us your take on how they're using the crisis they created to now openly set up world government?
[01:35:47.422 --> 01:35:58.106]  Well, everything you see coming out of Washington is more regulation, more spending, more tax on the freedom of the American people.
[01:35:58.106 --> 01:36:01.528]  Was it Rahm Emanuel who said, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste?
[01:36:02.248 --> 01:36:10.091]  And so, you either create a crisis or you take advantage of a crisis and then you come out, the answer to the crisis is more power, more government power.
[01:36:10.091 --> 01:36:14.232]  Now, in this case we're seeing all kinds of suggestions for global power.
[01:36:14.232 --> 01:36:19.735]  We're seeing suggestions for IMF to issue the money, we're seeing suggestions for global regulation.
[01:36:21.394 --> 01:36:22.535]  We're going to lose our country.
[01:36:22.535 --> 01:36:24.338]  We're going to lose the Declaration of Independence.
[01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:27.382]  We're going to lose the Constitution of the United States.
[01:36:27.382 --> 01:36:30.205]  We say to people, look, please, shake yourself.
[01:36:30.205 --> 01:36:30.926]  Wake up.
[01:36:30.926 --> 01:36:31.387]  Alright?
[01:36:31.387 --> 01:36:32.308]  Get involved.
[01:36:32.308 --> 01:36:33.169]  Help us.
[01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:34.511]  Join the John Birch Society.
[01:36:34.511 --> 01:36:34.911]  Call us.
[01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:36.193]  JBSUSA1.
[01:36:37.474 --> 01:36:40.956]  Or, get on the internet, jbs.org.
[01:36:40.956 --> 01:36:54.801]  We're glad to hear from anybody, and we're certainly glad to go on radio shows and television shows anywhere that people are saying the same kind of thing, and we'll lend support, and we support each other, I guess, just to try to save our country.
[01:36:54.801 --> 01:37:00.423]  Well, you have an invaluable monthly magazine, and it's just always... Oh no, every second week, not monthly.
[01:37:00.423 --> 01:37:01.643]  That's right, every two weeks.
[01:37:01.643 --> 01:37:02.184]  It is just...
[01:37:03.869 --> 01:37:12.716]  Just invaluable information, so well documented, and folks can also go to the website and... Get the New American Magazine, right.
[01:37:12.716 --> 01:37:18.801]  The New American Magazine will supply anybody with the nuts and bolts information that you need.
[01:37:18.801 --> 01:37:21.444]  There's a lot of people in our country who say, well, there's something wrong here.
[01:37:21.444 --> 01:37:23.005]  I don't like the Federal Reserve.
[01:37:23.005 --> 01:37:23.926]  But they don't know why.
[01:37:23.926 --> 01:37:25.607]  They don't have the nuts and bolts.
[01:37:25.607 --> 01:37:27.469]  You go to our magazine, you get the nuts and bolts.
[01:37:28.529 --> 01:37:30.170]  I want to go back and focus on this, though.
[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:37.252]  We have hundreds of mainstream news articles now admitting world government, saying it'll be a world government, a bank of the world.
[01:37:37.252 --> 01:37:47.335]  Time and Newsweek with headlines like New World Order saying it'll be a new bank of the world that sets interest rates and sets currency values and knocks the heads of bad people and that will pay carbon taxes to.
[01:37:47.335 --> 01:37:49.215]  This whole Malthusian move.
[01:37:49.215 --> 01:37:51.396]  I mean, this is a totally controlled economy.
[01:37:52.276 --> 01:37:54.497]  And that is not a free market.
[01:37:54.497 --> 01:37:56.518]  This international banking elite are monopoly men.
[01:37:56.518 --> 01:38:07.304]  So can you speak to the type of world government they're now publicly setting up, and then explain to folks in your own way that they keep claiming the free market has failed.
[01:38:07.304 --> 01:38:08.445]  This hasn't been the free market.
[01:38:08.445 --> 01:38:12.807]  This has been bankers, banksters, using government to create monopolies.
[01:38:12.807 --> 01:38:13.367]  That's right.
[01:38:13.367 --> 01:38:14.608]  Well, you know, you've said it.
[01:38:14.608 --> 01:38:17.349]  I don't have to... Let me hear your own words, though, because I've seen you give speeches on it.
[01:38:17.349 --> 01:38:18.070]  I want you to lay it out.
[01:38:18.988 --> 01:38:22.071]  What you see is taking advantage of crisis.
[01:38:22.071 --> 01:38:25.474]  And the answer is always more government regulation.
[01:38:25.474 --> 01:38:29.798]  And what we're seeing now is the suggestion is international regulation.
[01:38:29.798 --> 01:38:32.581]  We need the IMF to start issuing the money.
[01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:34.102]  We need this, we need that.
[01:38:34.102 --> 01:38:36.505]  Lurking behind all of this is the United Nations.
[01:38:37.085 --> 01:38:39.906]  And I know that the American people have a dim view of the United Nations.
[01:38:39.906 --> 01:38:46.129]  In fact, a Gallup poll just came out recently, said 60% of the people have a negative view about the United Nations.
[01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:51.272]  And most people in America say, oh, it's a waste of time, it never gets anything done, and so forth.
[01:38:51.272 --> 01:38:52.232]  No, that's not so.
[01:38:52.232 --> 01:38:56.694]  It's lurking in the background and poised and ready to take total control.
[01:38:58.695 --> 01:39:03.558]  The people who are supposedly solving the problems aren't solving the problems.
[01:39:03.558 --> 01:39:07.580]  What they're doing is building more power for themselves.
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:11.502]  At our country level, and internationally, and so forth.
[01:39:11.502 --> 01:39:13.583]  You got the EU working into this now.
[01:39:13.583 --> 01:39:16.284]  EU ministers are saying globalism is the answer.
[01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:17.125]  We've got to have that.
[01:39:18.314 --> 01:39:30.418]  I suppose you probably know that the $170 billion that's been given to AIG, the American International Group here, most of that money that they got immediately went to pay their debts in Europe.
[01:39:30.418 --> 01:39:31.499]  It didn't help America.
[01:39:32.796 --> 01:39:36.277]  Not that it should have been done in the first place, but there's a good example.
[01:39:36.277 --> 01:39:44.319]  And then of course you have them going after the bonuses that were paid, which is one-tenth of one percent of the money that's been given to AIG.
[01:39:44.319 --> 01:39:48.740]  And if they stop the bonuses, the people are going to say, well, at least the government's doing the right thing.
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:50.260]  No, it's not doing the right thing.
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:57.822]  It's diverting attention from the real problem, which is $170 billion being given to an organization that should have been allowed to fail.
[01:39:58.422 --> 01:40:12.770]  And that's only one of many globalist organizations, and there's no discussion of the franchise owner, of the big billionaire George Soros, David Rockefeller, Rothschild types, who are actually getting the money from the bailout.
[01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:21.635]  Meanwhile, they divert everybody with, oh, look at these CEOs who work for them, as you said, getting a pittance, a tiny fraction of the real money.
[01:40:21.635 --> 01:40:22.836]  A gnat on a bull elephant.
[01:40:23.715 --> 01:40:25.236]  That's what it is.
[01:40:25.236 --> 01:40:28.157]  But the people are saying, oh, okay, at least they're doing something right.
[01:40:28.157 --> 01:40:30.138]  No, they're not doing something right.
[01:40:30.138 --> 01:40:34.861]  First of all, if a company wants to give somebody a bonus, it's none of the government's business in the first place.
[01:40:34.861 --> 01:40:35.681]  That's right.
[01:40:35.681 --> 01:40:36.902]  That's another principle.
[01:40:36.902 --> 01:40:37.282]  That's right.
[01:40:37.282 --> 01:40:47.528]  It sets the precedent to come in and regulate every facet of the economy, and now that's the new power that they're saying they want to give Geithner is to go after not just banks, but other companies.
[01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:48.028]  Right.
[01:40:48.028 --> 01:40:49.529]  Now, Geithner's an interesting guy.
[01:40:49.529 --> 01:40:51.950]  He was the head of the New York Federal Reserve.
[01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:52.190]  Right?
[01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:54.111]  The New York Fed is the power.
[01:40:54.111 --> 01:40:56.472]  There's 12 member banks in the Federal Reserve System.
[01:40:56.472 --> 01:40:58.633]  A lot of them is just window dressing.
[01:40:58.633 --> 01:40:59.733]  The power is New York.
[01:40:59.733 --> 01:41:00.874]  Not even in Washington.
[01:41:00.874 --> 01:41:02.794]  They have a big, beautiful building in Washington.
[01:41:02.794 --> 01:41:04.375]  I've been inside that building.
[01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:04.835]  Right?
[01:41:04.835 --> 01:41:08.297]  Big, beautiful building, but the power's in New York City, and Geithner was the head of it.
[01:41:08.897 --> 01:41:09.457]  Alright?
[01:41:09.457 --> 01:41:10.878]  And what has Geithner accomplished?
[01:41:10.878 --> 01:41:20.062]  He's accomplished, as the head of the Fed, continuing a process of printing tremendous amounts of money that lowers the value of everybody's money.
[01:41:20.062 --> 01:41:24.544]  I like to say when I was a boy I could buy a candy bar for a nickel and now it costs a dime.
[01:41:24.544 --> 01:41:26.885]  But the candy costs the same.
[01:41:26.885 --> 01:41:28.686]  The value of the dollar has gone down 95% since 1945.
[01:41:31.325 --> 01:41:32.006]  Where did it go?
[01:41:32.006 --> 01:41:36.289]  It was stolen from the American people by a process called inflation.
[01:41:36.289 --> 01:41:43.354]  And inflation is not only thievery, it can destroy your nation, as it did Germany, after the Weimar Republic and their inflation.
[01:41:43.354 --> 01:41:51.921]  Well, that's the plan, they've stated, is to blow out the world's currencies and then set up a new super currency that controls regional currencies.
[01:41:51.921 --> 01:41:58.586]  And they're now announcing at the G20, coming up in April, and I was just watching Gordon Brown online... Bad man, bad man.
[01:41:58.746 --> 01:42:15.276]  A few days ago, before the European Parliament, and he said a global Europe, that's a quote, global Europe dominating the entire planet, and he said world government financial control over every nation, setting world tax rates.
[01:42:15.276 --> 01:42:20.519]  They got a world army, they got a world court, they're coming in with world taxation and regulation.
[01:42:20.519 --> 01:42:24.682]  Can you speak to the phony carbon taxes and the environmental movement, what that's really about?
[01:42:24.682 --> 01:42:26.183]  Because you've exposed that.
[01:42:26.343 --> 01:42:31.046]  Well, first of all, global warming is a charade, in my view.
[01:42:31.046 --> 01:42:34.208]  Yes, temperatures go up and temperatures go down.
[01:42:34.208 --> 01:42:38.790]  It's not caused by you and me driving our automobile or hairspray or any of that stuff.
[01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:42.533]  This whole global warming thing is a charade, a farce.
[01:42:42.533 --> 01:42:46.175]  And what it's designed to do is to give government more power.
[01:42:46.175 --> 01:42:47.816]  Once again, you see the same thing.
[01:42:49.016 --> 01:42:57.222]  So now they've decided that they have to have carbon taxes in order to shut down more of America's industrial power.
[01:42:57.222 --> 01:43:01.946]  Much of it has already been shut down by outsourcing and by NAFTA and the rest of it.
[01:43:01.946 --> 01:43:11.633]  So they want global carbon tax and the United States is going to have to pay taxes in order to continue doing any industrial activity.
[01:43:12.413 --> 01:43:12.754]  I think?
[01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:31.790]  It's just bonkers.
[01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:33.111]  Everything's backwards.
[01:43:33.111 --> 01:43:35.071]  And we've got all kinds of experts out there.
[01:43:35.071 --> 01:43:42.093]  We've got these experts in the economic field and experts in the so-called environmental field.
[01:43:42.093 --> 01:43:43.553]  People like Al Gore.
[01:43:43.553 --> 01:43:46.154]  If he's an expert, I'm a Martian.
[01:43:46.154 --> 01:43:47.134]  Well, he's very arrogant.
[01:43:47.134 --> 01:43:49.214]  He had nothing to do with the Internet and he claims he invented it.
[01:43:49.214 --> 01:43:51.215]  He invented the Internet, that's right.
[01:43:51.215 --> 01:43:53.976]  Which was around in its infancy when he was in college.
[01:43:56.696 --> 01:43:59.697]  Expanding on that, because you've written books on this, and you give speeches.
[01:43:59.697 --> 01:44:05.439]  You know, we've played some of your speeches here on the local cable access where I started out many years ago, waking folks up.
[01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:10.280]  Bob Daisey does it down there, also writes for the New American.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.561]  Expanding on this, can you break down for folks
[01:44:13.795 --> 01:44:25.380]  Why the globalists want to destroy industrial bases of nation-states, why they want to weaken all nations, then they have this big international body that then finances and controls what's left of those countries.
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:27.801]  I mean, they know carbon dioxide isn't bad.
[01:44:27.801 --> 01:44:30.502]  They're cold-bloodedly wanting to tax the carbon cycle.
[01:44:30.502 --> 01:44:31.222]  Right.
[01:44:31.222 --> 01:44:31.482]  Right.
[01:44:31.482 --> 01:44:33.023]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:44:33.023 --> 01:44:35.043]  It leads to world government.
[01:44:35.043 --> 01:44:41.266]  You can't merge the United States with some of the poor backward countries in Africa without destroying the United States first.
[01:44:42.006 --> 01:44:42.887]  And that's what it's at.
[01:44:42.887 --> 01:44:46.772]  That's what I said earlier with Volcker testifying before the U.S.
[01:44:46.772 --> 01:44:47.093]  Senate.
[01:44:47.093 --> 01:44:50.877]  The standard of living of the average American has to go down.
[01:44:50.877 --> 01:44:52.299]  I don't think you can escape that.
[01:44:52.299 --> 01:44:53.821]  That's what he said!
[01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:55.363]  And the Senator sat there and took it!
[01:44:56.385 --> 01:44:59.247]  And they should have thrown him right out of the room.
[01:44:59.247 --> 01:45:06.012]  Anybody who wants to destroy the standard of living of the people of the United States should not be getting confirmation by the U.S.
[01:45:06.012 --> 01:45:08.153]  Senate to lead the Federal Reserve.
[01:45:08.153 --> 01:45:10.575]  And that confirmation is a charade, too.
[01:45:10.575 --> 01:45:16.079]  Everybody who goes before the Senate for confirmation for a Federal Reserve job always gets passed.
[01:45:16.079 --> 01:45:19.722]  The Fed comes to the President and says, we want you to nominate this guy, and that's who they nominate.
[01:45:20.702 --> 01:45:26.909]  And while we went from Volker to Greenspan, now we got Bernanke, who is a disciple of Greenspan.
[01:45:26.909 --> 01:45:28.371]  And what's he calling for?
[01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:30.233]  He's calling for more government regulation.
[01:45:30.233 --> 01:45:32.235]  He's calling for more government power.
[01:45:32.235 --> 01:45:33.877]  And so forth.
[01:45:33.877 --> 01:45:37.440]  You can't have more and more and more of something without filling it up.
[01:45:38.254 --> 01:45:40.936]  And when they fill it up, it's going to be the New World Order.
[01:45:40.936 --> 01:45:42.877]  The Novus Ordo Seclorum.
[01:45:42.877 --> 01:45:43.958]  That's what they're after.
[01:45:43.958 --> 01:45:50.582]  If they succeed, from their own documents that you've researched, what will the New World Order look like when they finally put the capstone on the pyramid?
[01:45:50.582 --> 01:45:53.404]  Well, first of all, everybody will be a slave to government.
[01:45:53.404 --> 01:45:56.626]  You will be working for government if you have a job.
[01:45:56.626 --> 01:46:03.210]  And secondly, I believe that there will be a physical extermination of many, many millions of people.
[01:46:03.732 --> 01:46:05.454]  They've done it everywhere they've taken over.
[01:46:05.454 --> 01:46:10.159]  They did it in Russia, they did it in China, they did it in Laos, they did it in Cambodia.
[01:46:10.159 --> 01:46:15.826]  Every place where total government has taken over, there has been carnage of immense proportions.
[01:46:15.826 --> 01:46:16.727]  Now you got a guy like...
[01:46:19.401 --> 01:46:24.625]  Who's the guy running around in his little boat, the great oceanographer?
[01:46:24.625 --> 01:46:25.206]  Jacques Cousteau.
[01:46:25.206 --> 01:46:26.287]  Jacques Cousteau.
[01:46:26.287 --> 01:46:27.648]  Did you ever see what he said?
[01:46:27.648 --> 01:46:30.991]  Yeah, we've got to kill 350-something thousand people a day.
[01:46:30.991 --> 01:46:34.894]  It's a terrible thing to say that, but it's even more terrible not to say it and not to do it.
[01:46:34.894 --> 01:46:35.435]  That's right.
[01:46:37.056 --> 01:46:37.497]  Go over that.
[01:46:37.497 --> 01:46:42.361]  The United Nations 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment says they've got to get rid of 80% of us.
[01:46:42.361 --> 01:46:44.443]  All these public statements by Prince Philip.
[01:46:44.443 --> 01:46:46.665]  I mean, this is what they do.
[01:46:46.665 --> 01:46:47.666]  This is what they're into.
[01:46:47.666 --> 01:46:48.727]  Explain that to people.
[01:46:48.727 --> 01:46:52.110]  Well, you know, why would you want to do that?
[01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:54.432]  Except that you hate mankind.
[01:46:54.432 --> 01:46:59.176]  Except that you have a diabolical determination to rule the world.
[01:46:59.176 --> 01:47:00.657]  And you're going to get a lot of people out of the way.
[01:47:01.738 --> 01:47:06.519]  Scare the rest into submission by killing so many.
[01:47:06.519 --> 01:47:09.180]  Cousteau is supposed to be a nice man.
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:11.681]  He's worried about the oceans and everything else.
[01:47:11.681 --> 01:47:13.702]  But he actually said what you said.
[01:47:13.702 --> 01:47:19.483]  I think it was 435,000 a day until we get down to a level of about 1 million people.
[01:47:19.483 --> 01:47:23.305]  Yeah, well, when I make films, I actually go to the library to pull the quotes.
[01:47:23.305 --> 01:47:24.565]  That was appeared, incidentally.
[01:47:24.565 --> 01:47:26.485]  That appeared in the United Nations document.
[01:47:26.485 --> 01:47:27.426]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:47:28.499 --> 01:47:42.043]  And so the reason people will then find our numbers and go, well I found this, I found that, Cousteau said that dozens of times, different numbers, 300 and something, 400 and something, 500 and something in a PBS interview he did right before he died in France.
[01:47:42.043 --> 01:47:43.764]  It was interviewed in his garden, there's video of it.
[01:47:45.524 --> 01:47:55.513]  I mean, he said it constantly, just like Prince Philip in books and Reuters articles and German newspapers said, I want to come back reincarnated as a virus to kill 80% of the population.
[01:47:55.513 --> 01:47:57.975]  So, there's a lot of different quotes, but you're absolutely right.
[01:47:57.975 --> 01:48:00.377]  And then you've got Walter Cronkite saying it.
[01:48:00.377 --> 01:48:06.542]  You've got Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his daddy heading up Planned Parenthood, a eugenics organization.
[01:48:06.542 --> 01:48:09.304]  And from my research, when I cover an endgame, and I want to get your take on this, sir,
[01:48:10.305 --> 01:48:14.672]  You had eugenics being the dominant scientific craze a hundred years ago.
[01:48:14.672 --> 01:48:16.635]  It's what founded a lot of institutions here.
[01:48:16.635 --> 01:48:24.748]  The Rockefellers funded it in England, in Germany, the Kaiser Wilhelm Scientific Research Group.
[01:48:25.649 --> 01:48:25.889]  I think so.
[01:48:41.178 --> 01:48:49.042]  This is the majority view, and when he was given an award at the Texas Academy of Sciences, it was in the newspaper, he got a 95% standing ovation.
[01:48:49.042 --> 01:48:50.122]  I had the reporter on.
[01:48:50.122 --> 01:48:53.704]  He said it was like being in a nightmare science fiction movie.
[01:48:53.704 --> 01:49:03.228]  They had tears of joy with a three minute standing ovation when he projected red skulls on a wall and said, I can't wait until Ebola kills 90% of people.
[01:49:04.008 --> 01:49:08.494]  Yeah, and they keep saying that Adolf Hitler is something we have to worry about.
[01:49:08.494 --> 01:49:13.922]  No, we have to worry about Adolf Hitler mentality, which is what these people have.
[01:49:13.922 --> 01:49:19.791]  Can you specifically get into more of what their master plan will be like from your deep study?
[01:49:20.828 --> 01:49:21.789]  It's very simple.
[01:49:21.789 --> 01:49:24.311]  Total government and then suppression.
[01:49:24.311 --> 01:49:27.113]  Suppression of anybody who wants to be free.
[01:49:27.113 --> 01:49:30.436]  Suppression of anybody who wants to protect his own home with his own weapons.
[01:49:30.436 --> 01:49:33.679]  Certainly that.
[01:49:33.679 --> 01:49:35.260]  Rationing cards.
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:40.304]  You can't get food unless you submit to the government's regulations and you have the card to prove it.
[01:49:41.832 --> 01:49:49.658]  You know, the business of the mark of the beast, it doesn't necessarily have to be on your forehead, it could be in your pocket.
[01:49:49.658 --> 01:49:51.640]  You must have something like that.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.104]  We're in very, very interesting times, to put it very mildly.
[01:49:56.104 --> 01:49:58.506]  But I believe that this can be turned around.
[01:49:58.506 --> 01:50:05.852]  I believe that this whole business of the race towards tyranny, the race towards total government, can be stopped.
[01:50:05.852 --> 01:50:08.714]  And it's going to be stopped in our country through the House of Representatives.
[01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:12.132]  You're absolutely right, and
[01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:57.205]  Incidentally, they have introduced a bill, they already have the Real ID Act, you know, for the National ID Card, but they've introduced a bill, and I've seen Homeland Security speak to this, where you're going to have this National ID Card, even if it's a state card, it'll be federally approved, we're going to come back and discuss this, to basically buy and sell, and they're going to sneak that through with a National Sales Tax.
[01:50:57.205 --> 01:50:59.707]  We'll break that down and talk about Obama when we return.
[01:51:01.841 --> 01:51:07.344]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:51:07.344 --> 01:51:08.145]  and the world.
[01:51:08.145 --> 01:51:12.007]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:51:12.007 --> 01:51:18.510]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:20.532]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:51:20.532 --> 01:51:28.336]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:51:28.596 --> 01:51:33.301]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:51:33.301 --> 01:51:39.127]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:51:39.127 --> 01:51:41.310]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:42.551]  We will be more than happy to s-
[01:51:47.631 --> 01:51:49.173]  In the New World Orders War Against Humanity
[01:52:04.568 --> 01:52:07.389]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.389 --> 01:52:13.271]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.271 --> 01:52:19.694]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.694 --> 01:52:21.754]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.754 --> 01:52:24.215]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:24.215 --> 01:52:33.799]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[01:52:34.259 --> 01:52:37.240]  That's fascism.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.921]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.921 --> 01:52:40.781]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:40.781 --> 01:52:47.684]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:55.947 --> 01:52:57.527]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.527 --> 01:52:58.708]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.569 --> 01:53:03.810]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.151]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:53:06.151 --> 01:53:09.753]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:53:09.753 --> 01:53:10.693]  Be smart.
[01:53:10.693 --> 01:53:11.674]  Be safe.
[01:53:11.674 --> 01:53:13.875]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:54:11.849 --> 01:54:13.530]  We've got him with us for another 20 minutes.
[01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:16.692]  We have another guest joining us on the program.
[01:54:16.692 --> 01:54:21.495]  He's John McManus, president of the John Birch Society in studio.
[01:54:21.495 --> 01:54:23.797]  And he's going to be speaking here in Texas.
[01:54:23.797 --> 01:54:26.238]  For those that just joined us, where are you speaking tonight?
[01:54:26.238 --> 01:54:29.180]  Tonight in San Antonio at the Embassy Suites.
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:33.563]  And Friday night at the Richardson Civic Center in Richardson, Texas, right outside Dallas.
[01:54:33.703 --> 01:54:34.724]  And there is some room left.
[01:54:34.724 --> 01:54:36.025]  I know a lot of these sell out.
[01:54:36.025 --> 01:54:40.168]  Well, I always like it when they have to open up the wall and put more chairs in and so forth.
[01:54:40.168 --> 01:54:42.070]  So anybody that wants to come... Anybody, alright.
[01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:43.491]  There's an admission charge.
[01:54:43.491 --> 01:54:46.453]  Somebody's got to pay all the airline freight that I... Oh, I understand.
[01:54:46.453 --> 01:54:47.354]  And for the hotel.
[01:54:47.354 --> 01:54:47.694]  And the hotel.
[01:54:47.694 --> 01:54:49.716]  People have no idea how much those conference rooms cost.
[01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:54.239]  Some of them are out of sight and some of them are pretty reasonable, but most of them are out of sight.
[01:54:54.239 --> 01:54:54.800]  You're right.
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.283]  Yeah, that's why we... And of course, the hotels are all suffering right now.
[01:54:58.283 --> 01:55:00.604]  They've got to make some money because the business is down.
[01:55:01.425 --> 01:55:09.720]  People aren't traveling and a lot of business stuff is being done by telephone rather than visits and so... All of that.
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:10.682]  Barack Obama!
[01:55:11.528 --> 01:55:15.972]  I mean, this guy is handled by the elite, the most elite of the elite.
[01:55:15.972 --> 01:55:18.053]  Have you seen his birth certificate yet?
[01:55:18.053 --> 01:55:18.554]  I haven't.
[01:55:18.554 --> 01:55:19.234]  No, I haven't.
[01:55:19.234 --> 01:55:19.835]  No.
[01:55:19.835 --> 01:55:20.415]  No.
[01:55:20.415 --> 01:55:21.636]  Isn't that amazing, huh?
[01:55:21.636 --> 01:55:22.037]  No.
[01:55:22.037 --> 01:55:27.341]  He could put an end to all of this speculation by simply producing a birth certificate, and he hasn't done it.
[01:55:27.341 --> 01:55:32.686]  I can remember it was about a year ago almost that they discovered that he had an aunt living in Boston.
[01:55:33.466 --> 01:55:37.789]  And she was living in a housing project, and she wasn't illegally here, and so forth.
[01:55:37.789 --> 01:55:45.034]  And she said, on a Boston interview, that she was present at his birth in Kenya.
[01:55:45.034 --> 01:55:46.595]  And, uh, she disappeared.
[01:55:48.157 --> 01:55:49.178]  I don't know where she is today.
[01:56:08.655 --> 01:56:09.396]  In Kenya.
[01:56:09.396 --> 01:56:10.196]  In Kenya.
[01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:14.098]  I mean, this guy could care less about his own family.
[01:56:14.098 --> 01:56:18.041]  He's certainly not going to care about the people of this country.
[01:56:18.041 --> 01:56:22.223]  Can you specifically speak to not caring about the aunt, not caring about the half-brother?
[01:56:22.223 --> 01:56:26.706]  Well, it's something that I wouldn't do, and you wouldn't do, and most decent people wouldn't do.
[01:56:26.706 --> 01:56:28.968]  They would care about their own people, and they should.
[01:56:29.929 --> 01:56:34.498]  That's Christian charity and that's supposedly in everybody.
[01:56:34.498 --> 01:56:36.161]  You should be able to do that.
[01:56:36.161 --> 01:56:38.606]  But there's so much more about Obama beyond this.
[01:56:40.216 --> 01:56:43.698]  Look at his buddy, the bomb-throwing Lou Ayers.
[01:56:43.698 --> 01:56:49.260]  This guy threw bombs at the Pentagon and so forth, and somehow he got rehabilitated.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:57.944]  And all of a sudden we're forgetting about Reverend Jerome Wright, and what he said about goddamn America, and we're not supposed to remember that.
[01:56:57.944 --> 01:57:03.747]  What people would like to do is to say, oh, the John Birch Society, there was an anti-Semite in the John Birch Society 43 years ago.
[01:57:05.453 --> 01:57:08.974]  And when we found out that there was, we gave him his money back and sent him out.
[01:57:08.974 --> 01:57:11.835]  But they didn't say that.
[01:57:11.835 --> 01:57:16.137]  It's selective use of information about people.
[01:57:16.137 --> 01:57:20.358]  Obama is, in my view, he's an out-and-out Marxist.
[01:57:20.358 --> 01:57:22.219]  Now what is a Marxist?
[01:57:22.219 --> 01:57:25.960]  A Marxist is somebody who wants economic control over the people.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.100]  Right?
[01:57:27.089 --> 01:57:38.298]  Uh, Karl Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1848, and he and Engels wanted to call it the Socialist Manifesto at the time, but they didn't because there was some screwballs running around saying that they were Socialists.
[01:57:38.298 --> 01:57:41.580]  Yeah, we are all Socialists now, says Newsweek, right?
[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:47.525]  So they called it the Communist Manifesto, but it has been the Bible of every Socialist and every Communist all along.
[01:57:47.525 --> 01:57:50.507]  Now, why do I say that Obama is a Marxist?
[01:57:50.507 --> 01:57:55.491]  Because he wants all of the things that are in the Communist Manifesto, in the Socialist Manifesto.
[01:57:55.891 --> 01:57:58.553]  He wants all of those things.
[01:57:58.553 --> 01:58:01.836]  But this always confuses the low-level liberals.
[01:58:01.836 --> 01:58:18.409]  They don't understand that the big megabanks and Arm and Hammer and all of them openly explain, and Carol Quigley at Georgetown explains, that the ultra-rich use socialism and fascism to vertically integrate power under their control, then they sit outside and above the nation-states
[01:58:18.789 --> 01:58:19.609]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.035 --> 01:58:52.737]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.737 --> 01:58:57.483]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.483 --> 01:59:00.446]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.446 --> 01:59:03.490]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:08.216]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.416 --> 01:59:09.556]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.556 --> 01:59:12.778]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:19.781]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:59:53.897 --> 01:59:56.299]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.299 --> 02:00:05.528]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.528 --> 02:00:06.829]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.829 --> 02:00:08.590]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:10.372]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.372 --> 02:00:11.933]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.933 --> 02:00:12.854]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.854 --> 02:00:17.679]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:20.021]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.914 --> 02:00:22.714]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.714 --> 02:00:28.315]  The John Birch Society puts out impeccable information and research.
[02:00:28.315 --> 02:00:34.297]  You can argue or try to disagree with what they think the solutions should be, but you can't disagree with the hard facts.
[02:00:34.297 --> 02:00:39.818]  They're almost neurotic about being sticklers to make sure they can prove everything.
[02:00:39.818 --> 02:00:45.039]  So I've always found it to be very, very accurate information, really some of the best out there.
[02:00:45.039 --> 02:00:46.939]  And they also sell things at cost.
[02:00:47.119 --> 02:00:51.362]  I mean you can get subscriptions to the magazine that comes bi-weekly very inexpensively.
[02:00:51.362 --> 02:01:00.228]  These are a dollar a piece, dollars and cents by John F. McManus, a video presentation, a JBS overview of America, public service edition.
[02:01:00.228 --> 02:01:01.889]  This is powerful information.
[02:01:02.669 --> 02:01:08.013]  And it's very well presented, and you can simply call 800-JBS-USA1.
[02:01:08.013 --> 02:01:17.020]  That's 1-800-JBS-USA1 to call and order these materials singularly, or I suggest buying them in bulk so you can get them out and wake people up.
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:17.781]  That is the key.
[02:01:17.781 --> 02:01:22.305]  If we counter the globalists, their agenda is so unpopular, so criminal, it will fail.
[02:01:22.305 --> 02:01:23.786]  But if we just say, oh, that's the way it is,
[02:01:24.286 --> 02:01:28.190]  We're going down a very, very dark road, so 1-800-JBS-USA1.
[02:01:28.190 --> 02:01:29.671]  Now, you gotta pay a shipping charge.
[02:01:29.671 --> 02:01:40.422]  Those are only a dollar apiece, so I tell people, get three or four or five of each of them, and a little shipping charge will be the same, and then you can share them with your friends, your neighbors, and everybody, and they're good.
[02:01:40.422 --> 02:01:46.187]  I've gone on radio shows where people have said, I just watched those videos, they're the best I've ever seen, and I'm very grateful for that, so.
[02:01:47.188 --> 02:01:50.891]  Okay, well, we were talking about Obama.
[02:01:50.891 --> 02:01:51.992]  Yes, we were getting into Obama.
[02:01:51.992 --> 02:01:53.954]  I wanted to bring up some of his policies.
[02:01:53.954 --> 02:01:58.817]  The House and Senate, the House passed a version that had compulsory service.
[02:01:58.817 --> 02:02:06.183]  It was just now taken out in the Senate, but it says they're setting up a body to look at implementing national service, youth corps.
[02:02:06.183 --> 02:02:07.024]  Hitler Youth Corps.
[02:02:07.604 --> 02:02:08.484]  Same thing.
[02:02:08.484 --> 02:02:09.865]  Well no, I don't think it's that bad.
[02:02:09.865 --> 02:02:11.125]  I don't think 7 million or 13 million.
[02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.689]  But it's bad.
[02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:24.769]  No, they said that's their goal.
[02:02:24.769 --> 02:02:26.510]  I mean, that's Obama.
[02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:34.671]  Ultimately, yeah, they probably would want that ultimately, but the legislation, which is something to oppose, it's there already, it's calling for about a quarter million.
[02:02:34.671 --> 02:02:36.532]  That's bad enough.
[02:02:36.532 --> 02:02:37.432]  I don't want to see that.
[02:02:37.432 --> 02:02:38.872]  I don't want to see youth corps.
[02:02:38.872 --> 02:02:40.092]  I don't want to see that.
[02:02:40.092 --> 02:02:42.773]  I want to see the American people independent of government.
[02:02:42.773 --> 02:02:47.474]  I want to see them limiting their government with the Constitution of the United States.
[02:02:47.474 --> 02:02:49.334]  You know, get back to the financial side of things.
[02:02:49.334 --> 02:02:51.715]  What does the Constitution say about money?
[02:02:52.395 --> 02:03:01.660]  It says Congress shall have power to coin money, and they set up a mint in 1792 to take the people's precious metals, stamped them into coinage.
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:06.803]  It says to regulate the value thereof, and they did that by having one-ounce coins, half-ounce coins, they regulated the value.
[02:03:07.443 --> 02:03:08.764]  With the purity as well.
[02:03:08.764 --> 02:03:09.905]  And a foreign coin.
[02:03:09.905 --> 02:03:11.687]  Okay, you can regulate foreign coin.
[02:03:11.687 --> 02:03:16.532]  What is a Spanish doubloon worth compared to an ounce of silver and pieces of eight and so forth?
[02:03:16.532 --> 02:03:17.533]  That's weights and measures.
[02:03:17.533 --> 02:03:20.976]  Yeah, and then set up a standard of weights and measures.
[02:03:20.976 --> 02:03:24.539]  Three feet in a yard, 16 ounces in a pound and so forth.
[02:03:24.539 --> 02:03:28.583]  And that's all the power that was given to the government of the United States in the Constitution.
[02:03:28.923 --> 02:03:42.872]  No power to set up a bank, no power to set up a Federal Reserve, no power to do all of the kind of things they've been doing for years and years and years, and they all swear an oath to that Constitution, and I think it's time for the American people to say, you abide by the oath, or we're going to get somebody else.
[02:03:42.872 --> 02:03:50.277]  And they've got this one power, and that's the one thing they don't do, they hand that authority over to a private Federal Reserve that tells them, you can't look at any of our operations.
[02:03:50.277 --> 02:03:52.258]  I just wanted to show you, so you didn't think I was exaggerating.
[02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:54.980]  Here's the New York Times National Service Bill, clear Senate hurdle.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:04:00.164]  And it says they want 7 million people to engage in... there it is, 7 million.
[02:04:00.164 --> 02:04:05.368]  Okay, alright, so that's ultimately... No, I mean, they're insane.
[02:04:05.368 --> 02:04:07.529]  This is Nazi Germany, this is Soviet Russia.
[02:04:07.529 --> 02:04:10.752]  They can call them communists, call them socials, call them fascists.
[02:04:10.752 --> 02:04:12.674]  It's always black uniforms and youth brigades.
[02:04:13.314 --> 02:04:14.134]  That's right.
[02:04:14.134 --> 02:04:24.019]  And then, of course, that's what happened over in Germany, and the German people took a long time to recover from it, and now they've got people like Angela Merkel over there, and she's bringing them back into it.
[02:04:24.019 --> 02:04:26.760]  Well, that's my issue, is they are trying this.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:28.601]  It shows us who they are.
[02:04:28.601 --> 02:04:28.941]  Yeah.
[02:04:29.616 --> 02:04:31.038]  Well, who are they?
[02:04:31.038 --> 02:04:33.661]  Well, they are people who want world control.
[02:04:33.661 --> 02:04:35.883]  They are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:04:35.883 --> 02:04:37.686]  They have ties to the Bilderberger Movement.
[02:04:37.686 --> 02:04:39.788]  They have ties to the Trilateral Commission.
[02:04:39.788 --> 02:04:45.995]  They have ties to the Club of Rome and they have ties to, uh, some of them went to colleges that had the Skull and Bones Society and so forth.
[02:04:47.076 --> 02:04:48.137]  Let me make this point again.
[02:04:48.137 --> 02:04:49.098]  We've got a break.
[02:04:49.098 --> 02:04:49.658]  Final segment.
[02:04:49.658 --> 02:04:51.940]  We'll do seven minutes on the other side.
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:56.803]  Absolutely great having the president of the John Birch Society, John McManus, in the studio with us.
[02:04:56.803 --> 02:04:59.105]  Next time he comes through Texas, if he'll do it, we'll have him back in.
[02:04:59.105 --> 02:05:00.086]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:05:01.328 --> 02:05:02.629]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:08.214]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:08.214 --> 02:05:13.239]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:18.824]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:05:18.824 --> 02:05:24.048]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:24.048 --> 02:05:25.910]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:05:26.331 --> 02:05:31.134]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:31.134 --> 02:05:32.255]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:32.255 --> 02:05:35.037]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:05:35.037 --> 02:05:38.960]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.142]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:42.142 --> 02:05:44.364]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:44.364 --> 02:05:45.304]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:45.704]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:45.704 --> 02:05:46.625]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:05:55.441 --> 02:05:57.985]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:57.985 --> 02:06:01.792]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:06:01.792 --> 02:06:07.041]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.819 --> 02:06:13.703]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.703 --> 02:06:20.207]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.207 --> 02:06:22.168]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.168 --> 02:06:24.630]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:06:24.630 --> 02:06:35.517]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.808 --> 02:06:39.490]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.490 --> 02:06:41.352]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.352 --> 02:06:48.259]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.259 --> 02:06:56.528]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.528 --> 02:06:58.089]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.089 --> 02:06:59.291]  The people strike back.
[02:07:00.939 --> 02:07:02.959]  Gardeners, you have the seeds.
[02:07:02.959 --> 02:07:05.420]  Now let us help you create the ultimate garden.
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:08.941]  And whether or not you've got good soil, we've got just the solution.
[02:07:08.941 --> 02:07:13.442]  Add Grand Liquid Organic Fertilizer at liquidorganicfertilizer.com.
[02:07:13.442 --> 02:07:16.802]  Restore life to your soil or apply directly to the crop.
[02:07:16.802 --> 02:07:19.263]  Visit liquidorganicfertilizer.com.
[02:07:19.263 --> 02:07:26.944]  Fuller feeding with our 4-3-3 or sulfate of potash with kelp is 20 times more efficient than applying amendments to the soil.
[02:07:26.944 --> 02:07:30.785]  Manhattan fish, blood meal, potash, and North Atlantic kelp
[02:07:30.885 --> 02:07:31.265]  I think so.
[02:08:02.046 --> 02:08:07.632]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.969 --> 02:08:30.110]  In closing, John McMahon is president of the John Birch Society.
[02:08:30.110 --> 02:08:36.432]  We've got Patrice O'Neill, comedian and actor, coming on the show in about eight minutes.
[02:08:36.432 --> 02:08:39.653]  The Council on Foreign Relations 10-15 years ago wouldn't go on the news.
[02:08:39.653 --> 02:08:40.994]  Limbaugh would say it didn't exist.
[02:08:40.994 --> 02:08:42.454]  Now he says they have no power.
[02:08:42.454 --> 02:08:44.315]  But now he's having to admit they're setting up global government.
[02:08:44.315 --> 02:08:45.515]  So is Glenn Beck.
[02:08:45.515 --> 02:08:48.917]  We're seeing what we talk about become mainstream because it's emerging.
[02:08:48.917 --> 02:08:55.459]  But now suddenly every other speaker on Fox and CNN and MSNBC is Council on Foreign Relations and Geithner comes out
[02:08:55.999 --> 02:09:04.286]  Obama says, oh no, we're not going to have a global currency in his press conference two nights ago, but then Geithner comes out yesterday and says, oh yes, we're looking at that.
[02:09:04.286 --> 02:09:05.387]  Who is the CFR?
[02:09:05.387 --> 02:09:06.508]  What is the global currency?
[02:09:06.508 --> 02:09:07.690]  What control does this give him?
[02:09:07.690 --> 02:09:10.072]  Why is it the brass ring they're after?
[02:09:10.072 --> 02:09:16.838]  After World War I, the United States Senate voted no to membership in the League of Nations.
[02:09:16.838 --> 02:09:17.919]  It was going to be world government.
[02:09:18.399 --> 02:09:19.940]  The United States Senate said no.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:21.801]  Thank goodness they did back then.
[02:09:21.801 --> 02:09:29.845]  So at that point then, President Wilson's chief advisor, his guy who lived in the White House, Edward Mandel House, got together with British counterparts.
[02:09:29.845 --> 02:09:34.647]  They set up organizations in their country to promote the goal of world government.
[02:09:34.647 --> 02:09:37.148]  The British formed the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:09:37.148 --> 02:09:40.510]  The Americans formed the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:46.673]  House, Wilson's chief advisor, had written his own book and he said he was working for socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx.
[02:09:47.637 --> 02:09:50.980]  Now, obviously, one of his disciples was Wilson.
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:59.067]  Another of his disciples was a man named Franklin Roosevelt, whose mother gave him a copy of House's book in 1920.
[02:09:59.067 --> 02:10:11.358]  And when Roosevelt won the nomination of the Democrat Party in 1932 on a conservative platform, he headed back east, went right past his own home, and went right up to Massachusetts to visit Edward Mandel House at his summer home.
[02:10:11.358 --> 02:10:13.881]  The first man he went to see when he got the nomination
[02:10:14.361 --> 02:10:14.601]  We're good.
[02:10:31.095 --> 02:10:33.357]  They said so in their magazine for years.
[02:10:33.357 --> 02:10:36.299]  We flushed them out over the years, pointing attention to them.
[02:10:36.299 --> 02:10:38.601]  And now they're going around saying, oh, we're just a think tank.
[02:10:38.601 --> 02:10:41.302]  We just have people... So, who goes to speak to them?
[02:10:41.302 --> 02:10:43.464]  Well, Bernanke did a week ago.
[02:10:43.464 --> 02:10:45.546]  Geithner went yesterday.
[02:10:45.546 --> 02:10:49.008]  Everybody who comes to the United States, Gordon Brown from England came to this country.
[02:10:49.008 --> 02:10:50.069]  Where did he go to speak?
[02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:51.890]  The Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:52.391]  And so on.
[02:10:52.391 --> 02:10:54.192]  So, people gotta know about this.
[02:10:54.192 --> 02:10:57.975]  We have a book called The Shadows of Power that explains it, and explains it well.
[02:10:58.928 --> 02:11:03.949]  I see you're advertising Ed Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:11:03.949 --> 02:11:10.311]  That's the history, I guess that's the graduate course about what the Federal Reserve is all about.
[02:11:10.311 --> 02:11:13.292]  So all of that, American people have to know.
[02:11:13.292 --> 02:11:18.253]  Don't rely on your normal media for the information that you need.
[02:11:18.253 --> 02:11:19.453]  You're not going to get it.
[02:11:19.453 --> 02:11:21.414]  You have to go to the alternative media.
[02:11:21.934 --> 02:11:23.135]  That's what we are.
[02:11:23.135 --> 02:11:27.739]  John Birch Society, if it's anything, is an alternative medium of information.
[02:11:27.739 --> 02:11:30.981]  Alex Jones is an alternative medium of information.
[02:11:30.981 --> 02:11:37.046]  You keep putting it out, we'll keep putting it out, and we'll get American people, enough of them, to say, finally, okay, we gotta stop this, right?
[02:11:37.808 --> 02:11:38.369]  Absolutely.
[02:11:38.369 --> 02:11:45.194]  Do you agree, sir, that the New World Order is attempting to finally bring in open world government?
[02:11:45.194 --> 02:11:45.815]  Absolutely.
[02:11:45.815 --> 02:11:48.137]  And that they're in super high gear right now?
[02:11:48.137 --> 02:11:49.238]  Yes, they are.
[02:11:49.238 --> 02:11:52.300]  I mean, I've been frightened over the years by developments.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:56.043]  I'm more frightened about this economic problem than I have been forever.
[02:11:56.043 --> 02:11:57.284]  But I'm not saying it's over.
[02:11:57.284 --> 02:11:58.285]  In no way.
[02:11:58.285 --> 02:11:59.166]  It can't be stopped.
[02:11:59.206 --> 02:12:24.949]  Well Kissinger always said they would use a great crisis to bring in their new world order and we have hundreds of quotes published in their own publications saying they want one world government and then all over the newsstands it's like we're in Mussolini's Italy or something or Mao's China and here in Austin, Texas there's pictures and photos of Obama in most of the stores and it's like he's being worshipped as a savior and he bills himself as anti-banker, anti-establishment
[02:12:27.590 --> 02:12:28.110]  Absolutely.
[02:12:28.110 --> 02:12:29.030]  Here's this magazine.
[02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:31.451]  This is Environmental Magazine.
[02:12:31.451 --> 02:12:33.532]  One of my guys is at Whole Foods today buying some food.
[02:12:33.532 --> 02:12:35.012]  This is on the newsstand.
[02:12:35.012 --> 02:12:37.013]  President for the Planet.
[02:12:37.013 --> 02:12:39.133]  Obama sets a new green agenda.
[02:12:39.133 --> 02:12:44.015]  This is nothing but neo-feudalism to shut down the free market because the bankers don't want competition.
[02:12:44.175 --> 02:12:45.895]  Well, you get your magazine, I got mine.
[02:12:45.895 --> 02:12:55.277]  This is the New American, I'm the publisher of it, and this is an issue that we had, Obama shock and awe economics, and it goes into it in detail.
[02:12:55.277 --> 02:12:57.838]  This is the kind of information we put out all the time.
[02:12:57.838 --> 02:13:02.679]  I got a team of writers and some researchers that I think are just tops, and they do a great job.
[02:13:02.679 --> 02:13:09.961]  They don't just say that this is happening, they quote these people, they show exactly what they've said, they show where it's going to lead, and so forth.
[02:13:09.961 --> 02:13:10.841]  So we want people to
[02:13:11.181 --> 02:13:14.943]  Take a look at the New American Magazine in addition to everything else we do.
[02:13:14.943 --> 02:13:15.403]  Absolutely.
[02:13:15.403 --> 02:13:17.964]  Give out the website for folks, the Jumper Society.
[02:13:17.964 --> 02:13:18.624]  Well, jbs.org.
[02:13:18.624 --> 02:13:19.525]  That's very easy.
[02:13:19.525 --> 02:13:27.048]  And then you can call and get those DVDs, the Overview of America, Dollars and Cents, 1-800-JBS-USA1.
[02:13:27.048 --> 02:13:33.311]  They only cost a buck apiece, but you have to pay a shipping and handling charge, so get a few and share them.
[02:13:33.311 --> 02:13:36.752]  And a lot of people do, and they say, wow, how come I never knew this?
[02:13:36.752 --> 02:13:38.333]  How come nobody ever told me before?
[02:13:39.173 --> 02:13:43.018]  And so, well Alex, we're grateful to be able to come and visit with you.
[02:13:43.018 --> 02:13:45.501]  I've been on with the show before, but I've never met you.
[02:13:45.501 --> 02:13:47.243]  I've never been in person.
[02:13:47.243 --> 02:13:51.448]  And you do exist, and so do I. And we'll probably try to do this again.
[02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:53.145]  Absolutely.
[02:13:53.145 --> 02:14:00.371]  One more time before you leave us, President of the John Birch Society, John McManus, tell the listeners again where you're speaking.
[02:14:00.371 --> 02:14:09.578]  Speaking tonight, Thursday at the Embassy Suites in San Antone, and then on Friday night at the Richardson Civic Center right outside Dallas in Richardson, Texas.
[02:14:10.319 --> 02:14:11.340]  Anybody's welcome.
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:12.440]  We're glad to have you.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:12.881]  You can come.
[02:14:12.881 --> 02:14:15.002]  You can ask questions after the program's over.
[02:14:15.002 --> 02:14:18.644]  I always stay around and a lot of people come up and have questions.
[02:14:18.644 --> 02:14:20.445]  We sell the books and we sell the magazines.
[02:14:20.445 --> 02:14:22.586]  We sell the DVDs.
[02:14:22.586 --> 02:14:24.007]  One last question I forgot to ask you.
[02:14:24.007 --> 02:14:26.909]  You guys have written a lot about the militarization of law enforcement.
[02:14:26.909 --> 02:14:28.550]  The open announcement of NORTHCOM.
[02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:32.452]  They want to put 20,000 regular combat troops on the streets of America.
[02:14:32.452 --> 02:14:37.655]  Under Presidential Decision Directive, it basically makes the President all powerful during an emergency.
[02:14:37.655 --> 02:14:39.256]  And they're now openly saying
[02:14:39.776 --> 02:14:41.917]  That they may use troops against the American people.
[02:14:41.917 --> 02:14:43.018]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[02:14:43.018 --> 02:14:49.062]  Well, that would be a total violation of American law, the Posse Comitatus Act, and so many other things.
[02:14:49.062 --> 02:14:54.445]  The military is not supposed to be the power, the plaything of the President.
[02:14:54.445 --> 02:14:57.067]  And that's what it's become.
[02:14:57.067 --> 02:15:03.911]  You look into the Constitution and it says the Congress shall have power to fund an army, but it has to be every second year they have to review it.
[02:15:05.053 --> 02:15:07.977]  The Congress shall have the power to create a Navy, and there's no restriction.
[02:15:07.977 --> 02:15:08.918]  Why?
[02:15:08.918 --> 02:15:13.223]  Well, every second year you've got to review the Army because they are fearful of a standing Army.
[02:15:13.223 --> 02:15:20.491]  They're fearful of government power having control over the military, and the Founding Fathers were very fearful of that, and everybody else should be.
[02:15:20.991 --> 02:15:25.455]  We don't want the military to be the plaything of the President, and that's what it's become.
[02:15:25.455 --> 02:15:33.081]  Not only to possibly enforce government edicts here within our country, but look at all over the world.
[02:15:33.081 --> 02:15:38.446]  We have troops in 130,000, excuse me, 130 different nations.
[02:15:38.446 --> 02:15:40.888]  Thousands and thousands of troops all over the world.
[02:15:40.888 --> 02:15:43.130]  John Birch Society has a simple solution.
[02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:44.551]  Bring them home.
[02:15:44.551 --> 02:15:46.913]  And if you can get them home before midnight, that'd be soon enough.
[02:15:48.393 --> 02:16:00.837]  Well, it's true conservatism, true pro-sovereignty, and we would definitely, I think, be down the tubes already inside the New World Order if it wasn't for you guys, and I really appreciate you coming in.
[02:16:00.837 --> 02:16:08.019]  Again, in closing, what would the Founding Fathers think of the police state, the military being used on the streets, this whole unfolding system?
[02:16:08.019 --> 02:16:09.500]  They'd say no, absolutely not.
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:15.702]  The Constitution says we don't go to war unless there's a declaration of war, and there hasn't been one since December of 1941.
[02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:20.152]  When we declared war in Japan because they bombed us at Pearl Harbor.
[02:16:20.152 --> 02:16:20.992]  Right?
[02:16:20.992 --> 02:16:22.253]  We didn't declare war in Germany.
[02:16:22.253 --> 02:16:23.293]  They declared war on us.
[02:16:23.293 --> 02:16:25.275]  Because they had a pact with Germany.
[02:16:25.275 --> 02:16:26.875]  But we didn't declare war in Korea.
[02:16:26.875 --> 02:16:28.256]  It's still there.
[02:16:28.256 --> 02:16:29.357]  It has never been settled.
[02:16:29.357 --> 02:16:31.918]  We still got 45,000 troops in Korea.
[02:16:31.918 --> 02:16:33.459]  We didn't declare war in Vietnam.
[02:16:33.459 --> 02:16:35.080]  We didn't declare war in Desert Storm.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:38.422]  We didn't declare war against Afghanistan or against Iraq.
[02:16:38.422 --> 02:16:40.303]  And we shouldn't have been there in the first place.
[02:16:40.303 --> 02:16:42.724]  But anyhow, the Constitution.
[02:16:42.724 --> 02:16:43.825]  Get back to the Constitution.
[02:16:44.145 --> 02:16:45.007]  Absolutely.
[02:16:45.007 --> 02:16:46.690]  John McManus, president of the JBS.
[02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:47.472]  Thanks for coming in.
[02:16:47.472 --> 02:16:48.614]  My pleasure.
[02:16:48.614 --> 02:16:49.636]  Great.
[02:16:49.636 --> 02:16:50.277]  Pleasure to meet you.
[02:16:50.277 --> 02:16:52.020]  I appreciate you being here.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:52.982]  It's been a delight.
[02:16:52.982 --> 02:16:53.223]  You bet.
[02:16:53.223 --> 02:16:54.004]  Good luck on the tour.
[02:16:54.004 --> 02:16:54.265]  Thank you.
[02:16:54.924 --> 02:16:59.106]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, and I appreciate our next guest holding the last few minutes.
[02:16:59.106 --> 02:17:03.008]  He's all over national television, VH1, you name it.
[02:17:03.008 --> 02:17:07.790]  One of the top comedians out there today, Patrice O'Neill.
[02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:15.914]  And the reason I wanted to get him on is I started getting reports and video clips sent to us, audio clips, from some of the biggest radio shows in the country.
[02:17:16.434 --> 02:17:17.134]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:17.134 --> 02:17:17.554]  How are you?
[02:17:17.554 --> 02:17:20.335]  You know what, right before you call me, I got a ring at my doorbell
[02:17:41.932 --> 02:17:42.432]  I don't think so.
[02:17:55.555 --> 02:17:57.756]  leveled down a little bit.
[02:17:57.756 --> 02:17:58.296]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:17:58.296 --> 02:18:01.038]  The New World Order is not coming after you for that.
[02:18:01.038 --> 02:18:02.118]  We outnumbered him.
[02:18:02.118 --> 02:18:04.119]  We outnumbered him a thousand to one.
[02:18:04.119 --> 02:18:08.021]  First off, for folks who may not know who you are, I mean, they saw you, but this is radio.
[02:18:08.021 --> 02:18:10.923]  They would recognize you from all the different television programs you're on.
[02:18:10.923 --> 02:18:18.787]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, your awakening to this whole globalist system, the elite, and why you're out there promoting the Obama deception.
[02:18:18.787 --> 02:18:24.490]  Well, you know, it was, well, you got to be careful in terms of
[02:18:26.016 --> 02:18:33.980]  Like, how I bumped into it, I was watching something else on, and it kind of, the ad came up for the Obama Deception.
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:38.922]  You know, I'm really into, thank God for documentaries, you know what I mean?
[02:18:38.922 --> 02:18:50.307]  And thank God for the Internet, because if I had to go to these libraries and stuff and just grab a book and try to, like, cross-reference and learn about this, it would be kind of impossible, right?
[02:18:50.307 --> 02:18:53.048]  So, when I went to the Obama Deception,
[02:18:54.214 --> 02:19:03.364]  The reason why I said you gotta be careful, I guess, is like being black and having anything to say that might be wrong in terms of
[02:19:04.073 --> 02:19:06.095]  Obama is dangerous.
[02:19:06.095 --> 02:19:12.419]  You know, you walk around and you go, well, watch this, this, I saw this, this, this documentary, man, the Obama deception.
[02:19:12.419 --> 02:19:14.761]  And, and, you know, as soon as you say that, aw, what is it?
[02:19:14.761 --> 02:19:15.521]  Aw, say it, Obama.
[02:19:15.521 --> 02:19:19.044]  I go, nah, it's really not even about him.
[02:19:19.044 --> 02:19:22.926]  It's about the presidency altogether.
[02:19:22.926 --> 02:19:28.971]  It's about, it's about like the, this, this, this new world order.
[02:19:28.971 --> 02:19:30.872]  And, and here's the problem.
[02:19:30.872 --> 02:19:31.813]  I believe in
[02:19:33.195 --> 02:19:35.697]  Most things I hear about the New World Order.
[02:19:35.697 --> 02:19:37.539]  Most things I hear about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:19:37.539 --> 02:19:39.920]  Most things I hear about the Illuminati.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:49.748]  But I try to come at it because... I try to come at it in a way where... Is that me?
[02:19:49.748 --> 02:19:50.869]  We're about to go to break, sir.
[02:19:50.869 --> 02:19:51.409]  Stay there.
[02:19:51.409 --> 02:19:52.230]  We're going to come back.
[02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:53.191]  We have plenty of time to talk.
[02:19:53.191 --> 02:19:57.374]  We really appreciate Freese O'Neill being our guest on with us.
[02:19:57.374 --> 02:19:57.994]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:57.994 --> 02:19:58.395]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.317 --> 02:20:09.563]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[02:20:09.563 --> 02:20:14.126]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[02:20:14.126 --> 02:20:18.809]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[02:20:18.809 --> 02:20:20.210]  It's a documented fact.
[02:20:21.090 --> 02:20:27.853]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[02:20:27.853 --> 02:20:39.957]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.

[02:21:39.463 --> 02:21:43.185]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.316 --> 02:22:14.900]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:21.484]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.484 --> 02:22:23.465]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.465 --> 02:22:25.967]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:25.967 --> 02:22:36.853]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.535 --> 02:22:39.216]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.216 --> 02:22:41.056]  It's about a one world government.
[02:22:41.056 --> 02:22:47.979]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:22:56.242 --> 02:22:57.803]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.803 --> 02:23:01.064]  The people strike back.
[02:23:01.064 --> 02:23:03.665]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[02:23:04.289 --> 02:23:07.630]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:11.390]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[02:23:11.390 --> 02:23:17.972]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[02:23:17.972 --> 02:23:23.193]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.

[02:24:23.584 --> 02:24:25.125]  Oh, Smokey.
[02:24:25.125 --> 02:24:28.726]  Okay.
[02:24:28.726 --> 02:24:36.008]  Very popular comedian Patrice O'Neal is online with us.
[02:24:36.008 --> 02:24:37.589]  Very gracious to spend his time with us.
[02:24:37.589 --> 02:24:41.710]  I'm going to play a clip of him on opening and Anthony coming in in the next segment.
[02:24:41.710 --> 02:24:46.872]  One of the most popular shock jock shows and we just appreciate him getting the word out and having the courage because
[02:24:48.092 --> 02:24:53.820]  I saw all these Republicans worshipping Bush, just investing everything in their identities with him.
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:25:01.730]  Didn't matter then if he tortured kids, didn't matter if they lied about WMDs, didn't matter if they destroyed the Bill of Rights, they were committed to him.
[02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:05.955]  Well then you get the first black president, he's sharp, he's nice, he says all the right things.
[02:25:06.756 --> 02:25:17.682]  I saw his Globalist Advisors, I knew what was going on, then he got in, he went back on everything he said he'd do, and let me tell you, especially with black folks, you know, the pride.
[02:25:17.682 --> 02:25:33.090]  I know, as Priest was just saying, I mean, it takes a lot of courage, as KRS-One and Professor Griff and others have said, to try to explain to anybody who voted for Obama that, hey, this guy is suckering you.
[02:25:33.370 --> 02:25:35.630]  So you got interrupted by the break, sir.
[02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:40.311]  Please continue with your whole point about researching the new world order, because you're absolutely right.
[02:25:40.311 --> 02:25:43.132]  I used to try to go to the library and cross-reference everything, and it would take hours.
[02:25:43.132 --> 02:25:45.732]  Now you can check everything so quickly, it's just amazing.
[02:25:45.732 --> 02:25:47.052]  Please continue.
[02:25:47.052 --> 02:26:02.855]  Yeah, I mean, like, okay, when I was watching, the other day I had watched the Obama deception, and then I watched Obama pick the 64 team for the basketball, for college basketball.
[02:26:03.693 --> 02:26:06.855]  I'm like, this dude is such a dude.
[02:26:06.855 --> 02:26:10.278]  Like, you can't not like the guy.
[02:26:10.278 --> 02:26:14.301]  He's like, you go, I like this dude.
[02:26:14.301 --> 02:26:16.943]  You know what I mean?
[02:26:16.943 --> 02:26:25.909]  And not saying, okay, I watched your thing and now I completely believe that Obama's the, you know, he's down with the New World Order.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:42.877]  But what your video did, is what I like to do, is able to put another thought process in my head, and another way to not only put another thought in my head, but to actually have a place to think, because I would have never thought
[02:26:44.196 --> 02:26:48.942]  Uh, some of the things that I think now, in terms of, I didn't see that video.
[02:26:48.942 --> 02:26:52.947]  But what it did, it didn't make me go, Alex Jones knows what he's talking about.
[02:26:52.947 --> 02:26:59.715]  It made me go, let me cross-reference the info that you gave in the documentary.
[02:27:00.525 --> 02:27:08.829]  And get it for yourself and get in some of these things that Henry Kissinger wrote and some of these, you know, some of these websites and some of these bills.
[02:27:08.829 --> 02:27:14.291]  And I realized that watching, uh, you know, and I watched the end game too.
[02:27:14.291 --> 02:27:21.754]  So that led me to, it led me from Obama to the end game, then to Zeitgeist and then to the, to the other things that's out there.
[02:27:21.754 --> 02:27:28.116]  But the one thing I realized is there's a mission level to all of this in terms of the people.
[02:27:28.116 --> 02:27:29.157]  And, and one of it is,
[02:27:29.964 --> 02:27:45.058]  I think that you operate, and this is not a criticism, this is just from me in this short time trying to learn about this stuff, that you operate at the same thinking level as, say, the Bilderberg Group.
[02:27:45.058 --> 02:27:50.883]  And what I mean by that is at the same intellectual level, at the same understanding.
[02:27:50.883 --> 02:27:56.248]  It's just that you're on the opposite side of these guys, but you have the understanding of
[02:27:56.638 --> 02:28:16.395]  The revolution and why that started, and the understanding of why World War I went on, why World War II went on, the conspiracies behind the banking system, and a lot of the things that, dude, my brain had the capacity to know, but just never fought to know.
[02:28:16.395 --> 02:28:24.181]  My mind never fought to know that the federal banking system was not a federal system at all.
[02:28:24.181 --> 02:28:25.142]  It's a privately owned bank.
[02:28:25.741 --> 02:28:27.578]  That seems very...
[02:28:28.648 --> 02:28:30.490]  Uh, typical to people.
[02:28:30.490 --> 02:28:34.613]  I guarantee that people that listen to your show every day and you, that's just nothing.
[02:28:34.613 --> 02:28:39.077]  But to me, when I found that out, my brain started to hurt.
[02:28:39.077 --> 02:28:46.463]  I started to look at, uh, like, uh, give, the Give Act, you know, HR 1388.
[02:28:46.463 --> 02:28:49.485]  And I'm, and I went to InfoWars and I'm looking for that.
[02:28:49.485 --> 02:28:56.731]  And I'm reading through this manifesto and it might be that one little part that says they have to look into mandatory
[02:28:57.419 --> 02:28:59.001]  I don't think so.
[02:29:16.787 --> 02:29:18.268]  Or go get some ice cream.
[02:29:18.268 --> 02:29:28.994]  There's just, it's either you put your both feet in and learn about this entire system about, like, you're, like, watching the Obama deception lead me to eugenics.
[02:29:28.994 --> 02:29:29.655]  Like, what?
[02:29:29.655 --> 02:29:30.275]  Eugenics?
[02:29:30.275 --> 02:29:31.216]  What the, what?
[02:29:31.216 --> 02:29:35.458]  And then lead me to, you know... Stay there, stay there, Patrice.
[02:29:35.458 --> 02:29:36.659]  We got a long segment coming up.
[02:29:36.659 --> 02:29:38.380]  We won't be interrupting for about 15 minutes.
[02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:39.400]  This is riveting stuff.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:41.262]  I gotta have you as a regular guest if you'll do it.
[02:29:41.262 --> 02:29:43.703]  We'll also fire out some of your websites and contact.
[02:29:43.703 --> 02:29:44.584]  Stay there because...
[02:29:45.564 --> 02:29:48.847]  What you were just saying had my brain making all these connections.
[02:29:48.847 --> 02:29:50.248]  That's how this works.
[02:29:50.248 --> 02:29:51.669]  Stay there, sir.
[02:29:51.669 --> 02:29:53.050]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:55.593]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.593 --> 02:29:58.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:03.001]  Spring is here.
[02:30:03.001 --> 02:30:03.962]  Growing season.
[02:30:03.962 --> 02:30:06.164]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:30:06.164 --> 02:30:07.886]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:30:07.886 --> 02:30:08.867]  Think about it.
[02:30:08.867 --> 02:30:12.951]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:30:12.951 --> 02:30:16.695]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:30:16.695 --> 02:30:18.617]  The country is running out of food.
[02:30:18.617 --> 02:30:21.120]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:33.614]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:30:33.614 --> 02:30:36.237]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass,
[02:30:36.237 --> 02:30:38.778]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[02:31:05.051 --> 02:31:07.893]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.893 --> 02:31:13.778]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.778 --> 02:31:20.282]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.282 --> 02:31:22.264]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.264 --> 02:31:24.726]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:31:24.726 --> 02:31:34.453]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[02:31:34.915 --> 02:31:37.898]  That's fascism.
[02:31:37.898 --> 02:31:39.559]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.559 --> 02:31:41.421]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.421 --> 02:31:48.347]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.595 --> 02:31:58.177]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.177 --> 02:31:59.378]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.098 --> 02:32:08.322]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:32:08.322 --> 02:32:12.864]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:32:12.864 --> 02:32:18.487]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:32:18.487 --> 02:32:25.551]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.

[02:32:31.394 --> 02:32:37.258]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:32:37.258 --> 02:32:42.701]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[02:33:02.034 --> 02:33:03.375]  Dude, there you go.
[02:33:03.375 --> 02:33:05.935]  So now why is it called the Obama deception?
[02:33:05.935 --> 02:33:11.557]  Because... Because everyone believes that Obama's gonna change the world, but the fact is he's just... Let's change America!
[02:33:11.557 --> 02:33:13.538]  He's just the... Let's change America!
[02:33:13.538 --> 02:33:16.499]  He's just the next guy in there to keep everything going.
[02:33:16.499 --> 02:33:24.182]  He's just the guy, he's just whatever they need him to do to be... And they brought up the fact that the last real president we ever had was Kennedy.
[02:33:24.182 --> 02:33:24.962]  JFK.
[02:33:24.962 --> 02:33:26.523]  And he was trying to like go against...
[02:33:27.043 --> 02:33:28.124]  And guess what happened to him?
[02:33:28.124 --> 02:33:28.924]  This whole thing.
[02:33:28.924 --> 02:33:30.926]  I hear something came out.
[02:33:30.926 --> 02:33:32.707]  Splitting headache one day.
[02:33:32.707 --> 02:33:42.813]  And they said that the only president that ever, that the only pre, every president that ever stood up to this, um, is no longer with us before he was not supposed to be no longer with us.
[02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:48.117]  And um, only one that made it through was Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:48.117 --> 02:33:48.617]  Really?
[02:33:48.617 --> 02:33:49.358]  That early?
[02:33:49.358 --> 02:33:49.618]  Yes.
[02:33:49.618 --> 02:33:50.738]  Like they were pulling those shenanigans?
[02:33:50.738 --> 02:33:54.421]  Thomas Jefferson's the only one that didn't, they tried to kill him a few times.
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:58.421]  But you know, back in the day they didn't have, you know, laser beams.
[02:33:58.421 --> 02:34:03.422]  Yeah, you had to hope he was going to sip the arsenic tea that you left by his bedside.
[02:34:03.422 --> 02:34:07.783]  You had to sneak your musket in and blow his face off.
[02:34:07.783 --> 02:34:11.164]  And he didn't, he's the only one that stood up against it.
[02:34:11.164 --> 02:34:14.125]  I didn't even know they tried to kill Thomas Jefferson.
[02:34:14.125 --> 02:34:15.185]  Yeah, a few times.
[02:34:20.905 --> 02:34:24.626]  All right, we're talking to Patrice O'Neill.
[02:34:24.626 --> 02:34:25.966]  Many presidents they tried to kill.
[02:34:25.966 --> 02:34:29.347]  It's clear that they bled.
[02:34:29.347 --> 02:34:35.709]  George Washington to death, and the guy that really went after seven times was, of course, Andrew Jackson.
[02:34:35.709 --> 02:34:38.249]  And they've killed multiple presidents, including Kennedy.
[02:34:38.249 --> 02:34:44.771]  But, sir, where you made me, when we're talking to a top comedian on national TV, Patrice O'Neill right now,
[02:34:46.231 --> 02:34:59.638]  Where you had me really thinking with what you were saying there is, you're saying on the same intellectual level, and it's not that I'm even smart, anybody can research history and know this, I'm reading what the globalists have said, what their own documents state, so you're right.
[02:34:59.638 --> 02:35:14.726]  I see things from their perspective because I study what they say and do, and history, and then once you're from that perspective, it's kind of like if you're up against a barn door, or an elephant, or a school bus, whatever it is, well it's yellow, and you back up, oh that's a school bus.
[02:35:15.386 --> 02:35:20.471]  Okay, it's got gray skin, it's got hair, kind of smells funny.
[02:35:20.471 --> 02:35:22.232]  Oh wait, it's an elephant.
[02:35:22.232 --> 02:35:26.576]  And so we're just pulling back and seeing what they're really doing.
[02:35:26.576 --> 02:35:29.098]  And it's all stated, it's conquering the world.
[02:35:29.098 --> 02:35:30.519]  What are we doing today, Pinky?
[02:35:30.519 --> 02:35:32.360]  Same thing we do every day, conquering the world.
[02:35:33.081 --> 02:35:48.639]  That's what Caesar wanted, and Hitler wanted, and Stalin wanted, and all of these people over and over again, they try to get this control and dominate, and that's my whole point, is that forget Obama, forget John McCain, forget Bush, if we ever want to get real change, we have to stop looking
[02:35:49.119 --> 02:35:54.081]  At the puppets, we have to look past them to the real power elite and what they're doing.
[02:35:54.081 --> 02:36:07.906]  That's why we call it the Obama deception, because Obama himself, as they build him up as this messianic leader, because he is slick, he is smart, he is charismatic, he is handsome, he is dynamic, he is a guy's guy, and so he's perfect.
[02:36:07.906 --> 02:36:14.729]  Bush, this little demonic creature who radiates evil, he was not the guy for the job, but Barack Obama
[02:36:15.289 --> 02:36:23.395]  As Henry Kissinger says in the film, he can bring in their New World Order, and then we go see what Henry Kissinger writes in his own books about what a New World Order is.
[02:36:23.395 --> 02:36:30.279]  It's a world government run by private banking families with carbon taxes reducing our population numbers by 90% through eugenics.
[02:36:30.279 --> 02:36:33.401]  So Patrice O'Neill, come right back in with me.
[02:36:33.401 --> 02:36:34.322]  Yes.
[02:36:34.322 --> 02:36:36.443]  Now, just there, right Alex?
[02:36:36.443 --> 02:36:43.128]  Right there is like, I got a family member who's really, he's been into you for years.
[02:36:44.091 --> 02:37:06.535]  And uh and we talk about it and what happens is I'm talking a little bit out of order and a little bit crazy because it makes you like you learn this thing it's almost like learning a new language I'm 39 years old and what you said just there the average person right just the average person is gonna run for their life because it's like
[02:37:07.705 --> 02:37:15.067]  I heard somebody the other day say that they referred to Obama as Alexander the Great.
[02:37:15.067 --> 02:37:19.588]  Now, this country doesn't teach history like other countries do.
[02:37:19.588 --> 02:37:22.729]  I mean, America just doesn't teach history on a basic level.
[02:37:22.729 --> 02:37:31.871]  So, I might have to go someplace as just a normal person who wants to be into learning about conspiracies and learning about secret societies.
[02:37:32.438 --> 02:37:37.501]  I might have to do something as simple as look up Alexander the Great.
[02:37:37.501 --> 02:37:45.346]  And it seems simple, but it makes your brain mush after like two or three days.
[02:37:45.346 --> 02:37:47.127]  Because it's intense.
[02:37:47.127 --> 02:37:52.211]  You're now dialing in to the reality of the world instead of the Matrix-like projection.
[02:37:52.211 --> 02:37:54.012]  I mean, here's another parallel or parable.
[02:37:57.105 --> 02:38:01.267]  I mean, it's like Neo takes the red pill and he's got to be rehabilitated.
[02:38:01.267 --> 02:38:03.368]  He doesn't know what's going on at first.
[02:38:03.368 --> 02:38:06.449]  I mean, once you... but listen, we were all there once.
[02:38:06.449 --> 02:38:07.850]  You say you're learning a new language.
[02:38:07.850 --> 02:38:21.196]  You're now going to find, as you get deeper into this, that there's all the stuff you can document and prove, but then there's the government and their operatives putting out disinfo everywhere because they know people are waking up and they set all these traps and quagmires.
[02:38:21.196 --> 02:38:24.838]  So, I mean, it is a bigger world and it will make your brain hurt, but it will also...
[02:38:25.618 --> 02:38:32.344]  You know, two things that your videos did, two things that it did for me, and two, subject matters.
[02:38:32.344 --> 02:38:40.670]  And they covered a lot, but two, that were very important to me in terms of learning, in terms of getting my mind going, where I needed to know more about this.
[02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:43.252]  One is the banking system.
[02:38:43.252 --> 02:38:52.720]  The history of how the banking system works, something I've never ever, I just said, out of banks, the bank is the place you put your money, I barely understand it.
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:54.181]  The whole system is shocking.
[02:38:54.659 --> 02:39:05.969]  The second thing that it opened my head to, and this goes into more like, when you start talking this, this is where people can get scared, is eugenics.
[02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:14.137]  And I'm listening to the deception, and I think it might have been the endgame, or it could have been zeitgeist, either one of those.
[02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:28.378]  Oh no, no, Zeitgeist is actually on the, that's the, well, what Zeitgeist does, he's now repudiated the 9-11 Truth Movement and the New York Times, and he actually wants this global government utopia and this engineered society.
[02:39:28.378 --> 02:39:38.305]  No, it's Endgame that covers the eugenics, which is the operating system of the New World Order and why they're putting AIDS virus in the vaccines.
[02:39:38.925 --> 02:39:41.046]  That's what I was going to say.
[02:39:41.046 --> 02:39:53.375]  This thing, and here's what I say, I have about a circle of two people that we talk heavy about this, is it seems like high on the list of agenda
[02:39:54.581 --> 02:40:16.077]  In this world is depopulation, is getting rid of people, and that's the thing that sounds like it's a movie, but I read the manifesto that Kissinger wrote like in 74 that just underlined all the ways we need to get rid of people by manipulating these countries and
[02:40:16.522 --> 02:40:18.284]  Here, here's a couple hundred dollars.
[02:40:18.284 --> 02:40:19.825]  Kill all your people.
[02:40:19.825 --> 02:40:23.268]  It just makes your head go, what?
[02:40:23.268 --> 02:40:29.313]  So when I'm watching your documentary, what I'll do is go, look, I can't just go, okay, this is gospel.
[02:40:29.313 --> 02:40:31.995]  I'm going to have to go to the thing, but it's all there.
[02:40:32.415 --> 02:40:52.757]  You go to, you just put Kissinger and population decretion or population control and that thing will come up and you read it and you have to sit down and take a deep breath and make some tea and read it and go holy Jesus they're trying to
[02:40:53.582 --> 02:41:04.171]  Get rid of people is part of the agenda, but how do you get people on just a basic level to go, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it?
[02:41:04.171 --> 02:41:15.381]  It just seems, for me, one of the things that make me angry about people is how easy we are to just not care.
[02:41:15.381 --> 02:41:17.063]  Like, how do we move on?
[02:41:17.506 --> 02:41:27.070]  Well, Patrice, you were talking about State Department Memorandum 200, where they take IMF and World Bank money and say, if you want this money, you've got to reduce your population by half.
[02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:30.592]  And then you talk to the general public, they go, oh, everybody knows there's too many people.
[02:41:30.592 --> 02:41:31.932]  They've been taught that.
[02:41:31.932 --> 02:41:34.193]  And see, that's the globalist excuse.
[02:41:34.193 --> 02:41:35.294]  That's crazy!
[02:41:36.383 --> 02:41:37.643]  That seems crazy!
[02:41:37.643 --> 02:41:38.523]  Exactly!
[02:41:38.523 --> 02:41:46.265]  So then you understand why, in some African countries, 46% of the people have HIV, and then they go do medical tests on them and they're virgins.
[02:41:46.265 --> 02:41:47.485]  They've never had sex.
[02:41:47.485 --> 02:41:52.946]  They've been injected with it, and they've caught the UN doing this, and it's actually all over African newspapers.
[02:41:52.946 --> 02:41:57.807]  If you go to Africa and talk to an African doctor or an African Nobel Prize winner, they're on record.
[02:41:57.807 --> 02:41:59.387]  Indian government has caught them doing this.
[02:41:59.387 --> 02:42:03.928]  They've caught them adding a hormone to the tetanus vaccine that then sterilizes the women.
[02:42:04.668 --> 02:42:08.191]  That's mainstream news, but you don't see that here.
[02:42:08.191 --> 02:42:27.726]  And so it's so dastardly, but when you see in-game, and you find out Hitler learned his whole game from the US and England, and you learn 34 states were sterilizing the women, and, you know, grabbing poor black folks, white folks off the street and sterilizing them, and even in some cases killing newborn babies, and that the US and England paid China
[02:42:28.186 --> 02:42:28.746]  Now, let me ask you this.
[02:42:28.746 --> 02:42:30.367]  Let me ask you a question if I may.
[02:42:30.367 --> 02:42:32.569]  If you was to have a curriculum, okay, where you were able to teach
[02:42:54.295 --> 02:42:55.696]  Anything you needed to teach.
[02:42:55.696 --> 02:42:59.558]  You wanted to teach what you're putting out there now, okay?
[02:42:59.558 --> 02:43:15.828]  What would be the one or two or three basic points that you'll get just normal people that you go, okay, let me try to get them to open up mentally to this so that we can move on to the next thing.
[02:43:15.828 --> 02:43:23.273]  Like, because you have to get people to want to open up to stage one before you get to injecting
[02:43:24.243 --> 02:43:28.339]  Uh, you know, Africa, you know, Africans with, with the AIDS virus.
[02:43:28.866 --> 02:43:31.608]  Like, which is not unbelievable.
[02:43:31.608 --> 02:43:34.410]  You know, to me, it's just not an unbelievable thing.
[02:43:34.410 --> 02:43:49.621]  It's a believable thing, but if I'm operating, say, on the level of a person just walking down the street, the garbage man, or a person that's just going to the mall, how would I make this as common thinking as Christopher Columbus discovered America?
[02:43:49.621 --> 02:43:50.861]  Do you know what I mean?
[02:43:50.861 --> 02:43:55.805]  Yeah, well, I would explain to them... ...in America, you know, just the basic knowledge.
[02:43:55.805 --> 02:43:56.325]  Sure, this is...
[02:43:57.466 --> 02:44:01.608]  Well, that's a huge question, so I'm not saying the best three things I'm about to say are the best.
[02:44:01.608 --> 02:44:04.029]  I don't have to think about that long and hard.
[02:44:04.029 --> 02:44:20.618]  I would explain to people that if you're not engaged and you're not informed, that you're going to be enslaved, and I would say, you've heard about Hitler, you've heard about Caesar, you know most governments are run by thugs and the people are enslaved, and you know about different tribes, you know, killing their neighbors.
[02:44:20.618 --> 02:44:24.360]  That is something that is the norm in human history, not the exception.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.782]  And, you know, you know what happened to the Native Americans.
[02:44:27.782 --> 02:44:32.105]  So, you know, giving them poison blankets with smallpox to kill them.
[02:44:32.105 --> 02:44:37.349]  And that's in British manuals they gave their military going back 300 years ago.
[02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:38.770]  So that's on record.
[02:44:38.770 --> 02:44:42.172]  And then I would say, here's their own documents.
[02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:49.197]  And I would say, here is the published university reports of the British field manuals on how to use bioweapons 340 years ago in the Americas.
[02:44:51.398 --> 02:45:04.841]  Okay, then I would say, here is Dr. Henry Kissinger's State Department Random 200, where they state this, and then you can go to the university websites, official government libraries, and it's real.
[02:45:04.841 --> 02:45:07.641]  I'd say, okay, you've been faced with this one document.
[02:45:07.641 --> 02:45:16.443]  Then I'd say, now, who is Obama's main advisor, and who does the CFR brags commands the National Security Council, and that's Henry Kissinger.
[02:45:17.323 --> 02:45:19.723]  And then they'll say, oh, I don't want to hear that conspiracy stuff.
[02:45:19.723 --> 02:45:25.344]  You just got to move on to people that want to hear the truth, people that want to be involved, people that want to be woken up.
[02:45:25.344 --> 02:45:29.345]  But I would also, you know, use contemporary... But what about the dummies?
[02:45:29.345 --> 02:45:32.626]  See, I guess, ultimately, it was a loaded question.
[02:45:32.626 --> 02:45:40.827]  And I'm not putting myself in, but what about... I don't want to offend anybody on this one, but what about dummies?
[02:45:40.827 --> 02:45:46.108]  How about, you know, secret societies and conspiracy
[02:45:47.526 --> 02:45:52.732]  For dummies, for people that just will go out, you know, I don't want to hear it.
[02:46:05.465 --> 02:46:06.166]  Right.
[02:46:06.166 --> 02:46:11.249]  And it explains it very, very simply to people.
[02:46:11.249 --> 02:46:14.572]  The most important thing is to say, do you know why your standard of living is dropping?
[02:46:14.572 --> 02:46:29.382]  Because the globalists want to bankrupt everybody so that we have to be dependent on welfare or institutionalized or within their system so they can then carry out social engineering, have the CPS kidnap your kids, do medical experiments on them, that's all admitted.
[02:46:29.382 --> 02:46:30.363]  This is slavery!
[02:46:30.663 --> 02:46:39.711]  We're being put on plantations, we're being put on reservations, compact control grids, and then if the dummies don't want to listen, you know, you gotta move on.
[02:46:39.711 --> 02:46:41.753]  I mean, I talk about the Revolutionary War was won by 5%.
[02:46:41.753 --> 02:46:54.664]  But you need the revolution, you need dummies, because what you're talking, and what the only thing I see that could happen, that could possibly change this, is understanding why this country fought.
[02:46:55.004 --> 02:47:00.566]  And it was like, basically, look, we might as well fight, because we're enslaved by British money.
[02:47:00.566 --> 02:47:10.349]  And ultimately, it's like, you need the lowest level of people, like on the feudal system, you need the masses to go.
[02:47:10.349 --> 02:47:14.771]  I feel so... I think we're so confused now.
[02:47:14.771 --> 02:47:16.311]  I agree, but here's the problem.
[02:47:16.311 --> 02:47:17.332]  It's not clear.
[02:47:17.332 --> 02:47:20.433]  Like, it's not clear to the people on the bottom that they need to stand up.
[02:47:20.433 --> 02:47:21.293]  But I mean, here's the problem.
[02:47:21.933 --> 02:47:22.954]  Here's the problem.
[02:47:22.954 --> 02:47:25.875]  The globalists are masters at creating the crisis.
[02:47:25.875 --> 02:47:28.936]  They create the banking crisis, their own documents say by design.
[02:47:28.936 --> 02:47:41.102]  Then they offer the scared masses, the very bankers that did it, say, look, we're going to punish AIG, and they're going to punish the little CEO for ten million bucks instead of the shareholders who just made a billion apiece.
[02:47:41.102 --> 02:47:41.663]  Right.
[02:47:41.663 --> 02:47:50.507]  And so they're always masquerading and doing sophisticated lies and saying, we'll fix the bankers, we'll create a world government run by them.
[02:47:51.823 --> 02:48:01.930]  You have to get the public to stop being as trusting, and you first gotta explain to them that both parties are controlled in England and in the US and in Europe and everywhere else, or they'll keep doing this bait and switch.
[02:48:01.930 --> 02:48:08.194]  Look, in four to eight years, when folks figure out Obama was a bad guy, it'll all be, as I keep saying, blamed on him.
[02:48:08.194 --> 02:48:15.179]  We have to stop having it be blamed on Obama or Bush, as bad as they are, and start blaming it on the elite who are always there.
[02:48:15.179 --> 02:48:17.621]  They bring new dummies in, they bring new fronts in,
[02:48:17.881 --> 02:48:20.583]  Now here's something I'm not clear on in terms of the Obama deception.
[02:48:20.583 --> 02:48:26.626]  Now is it possible, this is the thing I'm battling with, is it possible for Obama or any president to not know what
[02:48:46.571 --> 02:48:47.252]  I'm good to go.
[02:48:59.048 --> 02:49:00.990]  I have the answer to that question.
[02:49:00.990 --> 02:49:07.416]  There have been a few presidents who were conned by the elite to believe world government was sweet and loving and good.
[02:49:07.416 --> 02:49:10.459]  Woodrow Wilson, top professor, wrote the book The New World Order.
[02:49:10.459 --> 02:49:12.441]  These bankers handled him.
[02:49:12.441 --> 02:49:15.184]  He thought bringing in the Federal Reserve was good.
[02:49:15.184 --> 02:49:20.989]  Then before he died, he wrote letters, this is public, that I've been conned, this is a takeover.
[02:49:21.670 --> 02:49:24.833]  And then they poisoned him, he had a stroke, and then he was bedridden and died.
[02:49:24.833 --> 02:49:28.495]  So they did probably kill Woodrow Wilson, and that's on record if you want to go research it.
[02:49:28.495 --> 02:49:29.676]  He was poisoned.
[02:49:29.676 --> 02:49:31.077]  And then on a train.
[02:49:31.077 --> 02:49:35.481]  But the point is, that's a guy that woke up.
[02:49:35.481 --> 02:49:36.982]  Kennedy was the same thing.
[02:49:36.982 --> 02:49:38.663]  His dad was handling him.
[02:49:38.663 --> 02:49:40.004]  Supposedly had control of him.
[02:49:40.004 --> 02:49:41.825]  Was establishment mafia.
[02:49:41.825 --> 02:49:44.027]  Then his dad had a stroke, couldn't talk.
[02:49:44.027 --> 02:49:45.768]  His boys got out of control.
[02:49:45.768 --> 02:49:48.110]  And the establishment killed him.
[02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.730]  Obama
[02:49:49.511 --> 02:49:51.773]  He is the super class of puppet.
[02:49:51.773 --> 02:49:54.374]  He is actually very intelligent like Clinton.
[02:49:54.374 --> 02:49:55.435]  Probably smarter than Clinton.
[02:49:55.435 --> 02:49:58.537]  You know, frighteningly intelligent.
[02:49:58.537 --> 02:49:59.958]  You know, genius level.
[02:49:59.958 --> 02:50:02.640]  A genius level actor.
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:05.061]  Just has a lot of style and grace.
[02:50:05.061 --> 02:50:06.142]  I mean, it's all clear.
[02:50:06.142 --> 02:50:07.443]  He's an amazing person.
[02:50:07.443 --> 02:50:08.704]  That's why he's so devilish.
[02:50:09.484 --> 02:50:10.905]  No, he knows all of it.
[02:50:10.905 --> 02:50:15.088]  His mother worked for Geithner's dad at a top foundation.
[02:50:15.088 --> 02:50:21.633]  I mean, this guy is above Hitler caliber of slick, okay?
[02:50:21.633 --> 02:50:23.975]  I'm telling you, he is the one.
[02:50:23.975 --> 02:50:26.296]  This is the guy they're going to try everything with.
[02:50:26.296 --> 02:50:30.880]  Right here I've got this magazine, President of the World, President of the Planet.
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:32.141]  So I'm telling you, he is the one.
[02:50:34.676 --> 02:50:36.037]  Does that answer your question?
[02:50:36.037 --> 02:50:37.939]  He is fully involved in it.
[02:50:37.939 --> 02:50:39.320]  He loves betraying.
[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:40.761]  He loves deceiving.
[02:50:40.761 --> 02:50:43.944]  He is super dangerous.
[02:50:43.944 --> 02:50:45.865]  Does that answer your question?
[02:50:45.865 --> 02:50:49.428]  Yeah, that answers what I asked.
[02:50:49.428 --> 02:50:52.330]  Is that more get off the phone music?
[02:50:52.330 --> 02:50:53.291]  We got more time or no?
[02:50:53.291 --> 02:50:53.812]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:50:53.812 --> 02:50:54.672]  Can you stay with us some more?
[02:50:54.672 --> 02:50:55.453]  Yeah, man.
[02:50:55.453 --> 02:50:57.375]  I like to... This is amazing.
[02:50:57.375 --> 02:50:59.616]  You also agreed to go on with Burma's on the Info Warrior.
[02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:01.158]  Patrice O'Neal, stay there.
[02:51:01.897 --> 02:51:03.878]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:51:03.878 --> 02:51:10.842]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:51:10.842 --> 02:51:19.247]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:19.247 --> 02:51:24.971]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:25.131 --> 02:51:26.972]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:26.972 --> 02:51:29.174]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:29.174 --> 02:51:33.698]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:33.698 --> 02:51:35.920]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:43.706]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:51:48.047 --> 02:51:51.948]  That's 866-295-5305.
[02:51:51.948 --> 02:51:54.969]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[02:51:54.969 --> 02:51:59.130]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.

[02:52:01.831 --> 02:52:07.072]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.637 --> 02:52:15.220]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:21.783]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.783 --> 02:52:23.764]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.764 --> 02:52:26.285]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.285 --> 02:52:37.229]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.868 --> 02:52:39.529]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.529 --> 02:52:41.390]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.390 --> 02:52:48.293]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.293 --> 02:52:56.557]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.557 --> 02:52:58.138]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.138 --> 02:53:01.380]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.380 --> 02:53:01.880]  You worry.
[02:53:02.267 --> 02:53:04.347]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:53:04.347 --> 02:53:06.988]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:53:06.988 --> 02:53:09.108]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:53:09.108 --> 02:53:10.708]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:53:10.708 --> 02:53:14.309]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:19.550]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:23.511]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:53:23.511 --> 02:53:25.211]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:53:25.211 --> 02:53:28.111]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:53:28.111 --> 02:53:31.052]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:53:31.570 --> 02:53:40.215]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:53:40.215 --> 02:53:45.038]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:53:45.038 --> 02:53:49.040]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:53.063]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:53:53.063 --> 02:53:54.444]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:53:54.444 --> 02:53:56.185]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:54:15.169 --> 02:54:20.694]  You can just Google Patrice O'Neill.
[02:54:20.694 --> 02:54:22.715]  You'll find his big MySpace page.
[02:54:22.715 --> 02:54:25.137]  You can go check it out.
[02:54:25.137 --> 02:54:26.198]  We've got it up on screen.
[02:54:26.198 --> 02:54:29.921]  Patrice, let me ask you questions, though.
[02:54:29.921 --> 02:54:38.909]  Again, the courage issue of giving copies of the film and links to it to big talk show hosts going on shows, you know, discussing it.
[02:54:41.538 --> 02:54:50.528]  In your opinion, what is the best way to specifically reach out to one of Obama's strongest bases, African Americans?
[02:54:50.528 --> 02:54:52.049]  How are you doing that?
[02:54:52.049 --> 02:54:53.871]  The toughest thing is this.
[02:54:53.871 --> 02:54:56.574]  Okay, let's take your show or Fox.
[02:54:56.574 --> 02:55:03.361]  If I go on Fox or I go on a show like this, it's different from going on Opie and Anthony because we can talk about it
[02:55:05.743 --> 02:55:07.725]  It's always going to be humor.
[02:55:07.725 --> 02:55:20.180]  It's always going to be some humor involved and the seriousness even has humor somewhere floating around in it because it's talking to a different kind of listener.
[02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:23.063]  So when I bring that up on their show it really is like
[02:55:23.869 --> 02:55:24.630]  I don't think so.
[02:55:47.447 --> 02:55:51.550]  But the people will go, let me just check this out, you know?
[02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:53.612]  Let me go look at this, let me go check this out.
[02:55:53.612 --> 02:56:07.383]  So it's more of a... That's why I was joking about somebody knocking on my door, because it's more of a kind of nerve-wracking thing coming on your show, because you are serious.
[02:56:07.383 --> 02:56:10.865]  You know, I'm pretty much a layman at it, but I'm into it.
[02:56:10.865 --> 02:56:11.546]  I'm into it.
[02:56:11.546 --> 02:56:16.910]  I mean, I'm one of those guys that no matter how many different shows I see about where they make
[02:56:17.489 --> 02:56:26.373]  A jello bust of JFK and shoot it to make you think that it could have happened like this.
[02:56:26.373 --> 02:56:28.694]  I'm a grassy, normal conspiracy guy.
[02:56:28.694 --> 02:56:33.056]  By the way, they staged all that incorrectly, that particular show.
[02:56:33.056 --> 02:56:33.757]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:56:33.757 --> 02:56:39.459]  I watch it and if they had it staged incorrectly, I'm like, oh come on, I'm not falling for it.
[02:56:39.459 --> 02:56:42.301]  And I'm just, I'm a guy and black people
[02:56:43.081 --> 02:56:48.486]  In general, I'm leaning very much towards your side.
[02:56:48.486 --> 02:56:55.691]  Here's the problem, and this is what you had in your documentary, Obama's Black.
[02:56:55.691 --> 02:56:59.154]  That's the game that was a tough one.
[02:56:59.154 --> 02:57:01.196]  Now if it was Bush,
[02:57:01.736 --> 02:57:07.698]  Or let's say McCain won, you got about 40 million people on your side.
[02:57:07.698 --> 02:57:26.142]  And I'm not saying that black people are just going to follow like bugs, it's just the fact that look, the image, and I've always said this even before I started getting into this stuff, Obama to me was going to be essentially a symbol.
[02:57:26.142 --> 02:57:29.823]  It's just, if you're black in this country, you just want
[02:57:30.203 --> 02:57:31.344]  But that's what's so sad about it!
[02:57:46.453 --> 02:57:47.574]  But that's what's so sad about it.
[02:57:47.574 --> 02:57:58.158]  It'd be great if we had somebody who was anti-corruption and was for real and was black, but we all know whether he was black or white, if he was really against the globalists, they would have a big scandal or they would kill him.
[02:57:58.158 --> 02:58:06.941]  And so that's all I'm trying to say to people is don't get suckered... I mean it's just so frustrating and I understand... But you know what Alex, this is what I'm saying about...
[02:58:07.705 --> 02:58:12.766]  This is what I'm saying about operating at the level that all of this is happening.
[02:58:12.766 --> 02:58:13.806]  I'm in the middle.
[02:58:13.806 --> 02:58:20.068]  Like, I want to be at your knowledge level to just reference things that easily.
[02:58:20.068 --> 02:58:34.391]  What I'm saying about, there's never been a reason for black people to be deeply into what this government... We had an instinctual feel, an instinct that this country is against us.
[02:58:34.391 --> 02:58:35.291]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:58:35.291 --> 02:58:36.312]  Do five more minutes with me.
[02:58:36.312 --> 02:58:37.192]  I want you to come back and
[02:58:37.773 --> 02:58:39.857]  Uh, you know, say that because that's important.
[02:58:39.857 --> 02:58:42.361]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.361 --> 02:58:43.764]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.764 --> 02:58:47.270]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:53.021]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.021 --> 02:58:57.782]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.782 --> 02:59:00.743]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.743 --> 02:59:03.784]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.784 --> 02:59:08.506]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.726 --> 02:59:09.848]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.848 --> 02:59:13.112]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.112 --> 02:59:20.102]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.102 --> 02:59:23.386]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.386 --> 02:59:23.667]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:26.050 --> 02:59:28.511]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:59:38.557 --> 02:59:39.898]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:39.898 --> 02:59:40.418]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.418 --> 02:59:41.619]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.065 --> 02:59:56.468]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.468 --> 02:59:59.190]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:11.681 --> 03:00:15.885]  Final segment with our guest, really appreciate Patrice O'Neill joining us.
[03:00:15.885 --> 03:00:17.507]  He's on with Jason Burmiss.
[03:00:17.507 --> 03:00:19.429]  What, I think tomorrow night or is it the next night?
[03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:21.350]  Yeah, tomorrow night.
[03:00:21.350 --> 03:00:24.413]  The Info Warrior from 9 to Midnight will be on for an hour then.
[03:00:24.413 --> 03:00:25.294]  And to hear more from him.
[03:00:25.294 --> 03:00:26.616]  And this is his awakening.
[03:00:26.616 --> 03:00:29.258]  He's got the courage, guts is enough, smart guy.
[03:00:29.258 --> 03:00:31.861]  He's looking at this and he's asking the same question I'm asking.
[03:00:31.861 --> 03:00:35.884]  How do you reach out to these white yuppies or black folks, whoever?
[03:00:36.525 --> 03:00:38.547]  Because they're going to think you're saying, no, I want McCain.
[03:00:38.547 --> 03:00:38.927]  No!
[03:00:38.927 --> 03:00:43.551]  We're saying, it's like a used car salesman trying to sell you two lemons.
[03:00:43.551 --> 03:00:44.873]  And one of them's got a better paint job.
[03:00:46.371 --> 03:00:49.692]  And all we're saying is, you don't want to buy any car off this lot.
[03:00:49.692 --> 03:00:51.513]  You want to get to the real issues.
[03:00:51.513 --> 03:00:56.854]  And black folks, I've always found, have been the biggest hardcore fans of this radio show, because they've been screwed a lot.
[03:00:56.854 --> 03:00:57.715]  They know about the man.
[03:00:57.715 --> 03:00:59.075]  They know about corruption.
[03:00:59.075 --> 03:01:03.296]  And now, a lot of black fans I have are saying, yeah, Alex, we know you're right.
[03:01:03.296 --> 03:01:04.517]  And he is lying about stuff.
[03:01:04.517 --> 03:01:05.897]  But still, he's not bad, Alex.
[03:01:05.897 --> 03:01:06.738]  He's not bad.
[03:01:06.738 --> 03:01:07.278]  Fine.
[03:01:07.278 --> 03:01:08.938]  Obama, let's just say, is a wonderful guy.
[03:01:08.938 --> 03:01:09.478]  Which he's not.
[03:01:09.478 --> 03:01:10.499]  He's very evil.
[03:01:10.499 --> 03:01:11.179]  I'll tell you right now.
[03:01:11.179 --> 03:01:11.739]  I've studied him.
[03:01:11.739 --> 03:01:12.359]  Very slick.
[03:01:12.359 --> 03:01:13.140]  Very wicked.
[03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:14.080]  And he's betraying people.
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:16.741]  But how do we then reach out?
[03:01:16.741 --> 03:01:25.604]  Finish up the point, because I think what I got from you earlier is you're saying you're just going to plant seeds with people and get them to start thinking so as they get betrayed more and more they wake up.
[03:01:25.604 --> 03:01:30.225]  Say that in your own words and finish up what you were saying about black folks understanding betrayal.
[03:01:30.225 --> 03:01:32.106]  Yeah, but that's the thing.
[03:01:32.106 --> 03:01:40.889]  Right now, can you imagine all this time where you feel like you're in some kind of fight and you've never had a representative for your fight?
[03:01:40.889 --> 03:01:41.669]  Now you have one.
[03:01:42.119 --> 03:01:47.964]  It was easy to say that the government was this and that when it wasn't your own anyway.
[03:01:47.964 --> 03:01:49.746]  We've never felt a part of it.
[03:01:49.746 --> 03:02:01.336]  Now, for some way, and you gotta understand, you know, you gotta have the understanding of the fact that if you don't know politics and you don't know things like that, you may think that now it's the black president, now it's on.
[03:02:01.336 --> 03:02:04.379]  There's some white people who think that too, but ultimately, uh,
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:16.331]  Black people, the toughest thing in terms of being a black person is to actually have a different opinion than the predominant black community.
[03:02:16.331 --> 03:02:28.784]  And to stand and say something even slightly, like on stage I say, he's black but he ain't Compton black, he ain't black black, he ain't a dude from Chicago
[03:02:29.784 --> 03:02:33.066]  Uh, that he represents, he's an African.
[03:02:33.066 --> 03:02:35.947]  Matter of fact, Africans take him in more than black people.
[03:02:35.947 --> 03:02:37.608]  A lot of black people don't know that.
[03:02:37.608 --> 03:02:48.174]  And the thing is, is how do you, it's like, because I'm a comic, I get to introduce people to that in a way where they don't have to listen to it.
[03:02:48.174 --> 03:02:50.855]  They don't have to, they can laugh at it.
[03:02:50.855 --> 03:02:52.836]  So you can do two things with what I do.
[03:02:52.836 --> 03:02:54.817]  You can laugh at it because I said it funny.
[03:02:57.079 --> 03:02:58.260]  That's interesting.
[03:02:58.260 --> 03:03:00.362]  Let me go check that out.
[03:03:00.362 --> 03:03:01.824]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[03:03:01.824 --> 03:03:06.768]  And that's very difficult for someone black is to stand up and go.
[03:03:06.768 --> 03:03:15.417]  Even to say Al Sharpton, you're not saying Al Sharpton and you're black, it's because he represents black in a place
[03:03:15.857 --> 03:03:25.183]  That people feel is against black people, but what I say is that we're all... One thing I noticed about people who get killed in this world
[03:03:30.135 --> 03:03:41.404]  Um, nobody who ever creates confusion and keeps people, um, angry at each other and keeps people... When Malcolm X kept people separate, he lived a very happy life.
[03:03:41.404 --> 03:03:47.169]  When he started bringing people together and bringing everyone into some type of, uh, knowledge,
[03:03:48.014 --> 03:03:49.035]  Uh, he was killed.
[03:03:49.035 --> 03:03:50.117]  Gandhi, the same way.
[03:03:50.117 --> 03:03:52.259]  Uh, Martin Luther King, the same way.
[03:03:52.259 --> 03:03:53.780]  Jesus, the same way.
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:04:08.236]  It seems like when you are a person who pushes confusion and pushes anger and makes people separate and makes people think that it's a system that's against black and against... It's a system that's against
[03:04:08.756 --> 03:04:09.557]  The masses.
[03:04:09.557 --> 03:04:11.898]  The masses are to stay confused.
[03:04:11.898 --> 03:04:15.700]  And if you're ever to bring light to the masses, that's when your life's in danger.
[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:20.642]  You know, when people who are at the bottom start to go, wait a minute, hold on.
[03:04:20.642 --> 03:04:23.383]  Let's find out where the door is of the person at the top.
[03:04:23.383 --> 03:04:25.264]  Where's this Bilderberg group?
[03:04:25.264 --> 03:04:26.745]  Where's this Illuminati?
[03:04:26.745 --> 03:04:33.989]  Once that starts to be real, then I think this will be a bigger movement than it is.
[03:04:33.989 --> 03:04:36.250]  Because again, Alex, where I'm sitting,
[03:04:37.446 --> 03:04:38.527]  I'm in the middle.
[03:04:38.527 --> 03:04:42.748]  I'm intelligent, but I'm not informed with all of this information.
[03:04:42.748 --> 03:04:43.629]  But you're getting informed.
[03:04:43.629 --> 03:04:45.269]  You know what, Patrice?
[03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:46.450]  We've got another guest coming on.
[03:04:46.450 --> 03:04:47.070]  I know you're busy.
[03:04:47.070 --> 03:04:48.130]  I don't want to keep you much longer.
[03:04:48.130 --> 03:04:49.411]  A quick three-minute break.
[03:04:49.411 --> 03:04:57.434]  I want Jason Burmans, who you're on with tomorrow night for an hour, to be able to say hi to you and also plug some of your websites and tell folks where you appear on television, and then we'll say bye to you.
[03:04:57.434 --> 03:04:59.295]  Amazing interview with you.
[03:04:59.295 --> 03:05:01.416]  If you can do it, you'll be gone in five minutes.
[03:05:01.416 --> 03:05:01.976]  Stay there.
[03:05:01.976 --> 03:05:04.457]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.
[03:05:05.327 --> 03:05:13.071]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[03:05:13.071 --> 03:05:20.895]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[03:05:20.895 --> 03:05:27.178]  At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[03:05:27.810 --> 03:05:34.577]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[03:05:34.577 --> 03:05:37.380]  Beware, be smart and be ready!
[03:05:37.380 --> 03:05:43.747]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[03:05:43.747 --> 03:05:49.573]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:54.043]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[03:05:54.043 --> 03:06:01.770]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[03:06:01.770 --> 03:06:07.595]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.595 --> 03:06:14.581]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:21.742]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.742 --> 03:06:23.702]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.702 --> 03:06:26.223]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:06:26.223 --> 03:06:37.166]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:37.791 --> 03:06:39.472]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.472 --> 03:06:41.313]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.313 --> 03:06:48.236]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.236 --> 03:06:56.500]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.500 --> 03:06:58.061]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.061 --> 03:06:59.262]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.033 --> 03:07:05.015]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[03:07:05.015 --> 03:07:09.858]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[03:07:09.858 --> 03:07:12.780]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[03:07:12.780 --> 03:07:17.022]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[03:07:18.763 --> 03:07:19.063]  I'm good.
[03:07:44.617 --> 03:07:45.077]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.606 --> 03:08:09.367]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.367 --> 03:08:11.149]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.149 --> 03:08:12.730]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.730 --> 03:08:13.630]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:18.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.474 --> 03:08:24.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.038 --> 03:08:30.123]  Brian Garish, former naval officer and anti-submarine warfare expert.
[03:08:30.123 --> 03:08:34.426]  He's quoted in an article on the group in England
[03:08:36.128 --> 03:08:37.509]  Similar to what Obama set up.
[03:08:37.509 --> 03:08:39.751]  It's like a Stasi force.
[03:08:39.751 --> 03:08:45.175]  And you'll notice they say they're recruiting 60,000 people to spy on their neighbors, to look in their trash bins.
[03:08:45.175 --> 03:08:46.676]  I have articles on that.
[03:08:46.676 --> 03:08:50.279]  Everybody's a terrorist, which creates the illusion that these fake terrorists really exist.
[03:08:50.279 --> 03:08:51.760]  It's a Stasi society.
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:58.265]  They want us, just what our guest was just saying, fighting with each other instead of realizing the man behind the curtain.
[03:08:58.265 --> 03:09:00.547]  It's so simple, but it's hard for folks to get.
[03:09:01.107 --> 03:09:03.388]  That there is a shadow government.
[03:09:03.388 --> 03:09:05.548]  It kills any presidents it wants.
[03:09:05.548 --> 03:09:08.569]  The top of the shadow government are the people Obama brought in.
[03:09:08.569 --> 03:09:10.329]  Even worse than Bush.
[03:09:10.329 --> 03:09:11.810]  So we immediately knew it was bad.
[03:09:11.810 --> 03:09:13.770]  We knew he'd lie about everything he said he was going to do.
[03:09:13.770 --> 03:09:15.210]  He's now done that.
[03:09:15.210 --> 03:09:16.831]  But in England, they've set this up.
[03:09:16.831 --> 03:09:22.332]  And if you look, the people in the anti-terrorist spy force are also this common purpose group that's in all the key positions.
[03:09:22.332 --> 03:09:24.392]  That's coming up in about two or three minutes.
[03:09:24.392 --> 03:09:26.433]  But I just wanted to say bye to Patrice O'Neill.
[03:09:26.433 --> 03:09:29.154]  He's on the show for an hour tomorrow.
[03:09:29.154 --> 03:09:30.114]  What hour, Jason Burmess?
[03:09:30.834 --> 03:09:33.015]  Yeah, I think it's in the first hour, Alex.
[03:09:33.015 --> 03:09:33.595]  Okay, great.
[03:09:33.595 --> 03:09:36.776]  So in the first hour, 9 o'clock Central, Tamari's going to be on.
[03:09:36.776 --> 03:09:40.398]  Just Google up Patrice O'Neill or go to his MySpace, Patrice O'Neill MySpace.
[03:09:40.398 --> 03:09:41.398]  It'll pop up.
[03:09:41.398 --> 03:09:43.659]  You can see he's coming to Texas, but we're on everywhere.
[03:09:43.659 --> 03:09:48.060]  But we might go see him when he's coming to a nearby area of Austin.
[03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:49.641]  This is just very, very exciting.
[03:09:49.641 --> 03:09:52.402]  But Jason, you want to say hi to Patrice O'Neill?
[03:09:52.682 --> 03:09:58.568]  Yeah, you know, I just want to thank him for going on a show like Opie and Anthony, which does reach out to an audience that we don't necessarily reach out to.
[03:09:58.568 --> 03:09:59.249]  Yeah, millions of people.
[03:09:59.249 --> 03:10:00.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:10:00.010 --> 03:10:02.092]  I mean, a lot of my friends are huge fans.
[03:10:02.092 --> 03:10:04.935]  You know, Patrice used to be on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn all the time.
[03:10:04.935 --> 03:10:06.857]  He's on, you know, Best Week Ever all the time.
[03:10:06.857 --> 03:10:08.639]  He hosts these little YouTube shows.
[03:10:08.639 --> 03:10:14.505]  So he's a face out there that is going to reach an audience that is kind of at that dumbed-down iPhone level, you know, Alex?
[03:10:15.646 --> 03:10:16.647]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:10:16.647 --> 03:10:20.329]  So we need more people like this to come out and talk about these real issues.
[03:10:20.329 --> 03:10:21.249]  And he's got courage.
[03:10:21.249 --> 03:10:26.312]  I mean, this is a guy who's waking up to this, he's black, and he's got this amazing courage.
[03:10:26.312 --> 03:10:32.216]  I didn't see that from Republicans who just couldn't admit Bush was conning them because he was a white guy and looked like them.
[03:10:32.216 --> 03:10:34.137]  See, I mean, people are all people.
[03:10:34.137 --> 03:10:35.618]  That's a saying, it's true.
[03:10:35.618 --> 03:10:36.638]  We all act the same.
[03:10:36.638 --> 03:10:41.221]  We think, it's like sports teams, we think the guy that looks like us is going to represent us.
[03:10:41.221 --> 03:10:44.203]  But I was listening to, who's the new guy on CNN, young black guy?
[03:10:45.265 --> 03:10:46.586]  Saturday show?
[03:10:46.586 --> 03:10:49.149]  Well, he has a show on XM and I listen to it driving home a lot.
[03:10:49.149 --> 03:11:03.923]  And he had on this financial expert, and they were talking about how these mortgage companies ripping off black people mainly, would call up blacks that had good mortgages, been paying their bills for decades, tell them, oh, we're a black company, really weren't, and have them go sign papers and rip them off using a black person to run the scam.
[03:11:03.923 --> 03:11:06.205]  So, I mean, it's the same thing over and over again.
[03:11:06.205 --> 03:11:09.068]  But, Patrice, any closing comments?
[03:11:10.340 --> 03:11:14.204]  I appreciate it, man.
[03:11:14.204 --> 03:11:19.429]  I'm a fan of learning this kind of stuff, man.
[03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:24.874]  And again, like I said, I'm not going, Alex Jones is right!
[03:11:24.874 --> 03:11:30.039]  I'm just saying to people listening, I'm going, okay, he said this, I'm going to look it up.
[03:11:30.730 --> 03:11:35.052]  And some interesting things come up.
[03:11:35.052 --> 03:11:38.973]  You know, for a considered novice, Patrice, you talk a lot.
[03:11:38.973 --> 03:11:45.196]  Yeah, I mean, he talked about Gulf of Tonkin, he talked about the Federal Reserve Banking System on the show, he talked about Building 7 on the show.
[03:11:45.196 --> 03:11:47.857]  I mean, for a novice, it looks like you've already looked at this.
[03:11:47.857 --> 03:11:57.821]  And that's the one thing, and I know you guys have got to go, but one thing is that we argue a lot about logistics of certain conspiracies, but
[03:11:58.527 --> 03:12:04.396]  I like to try to get to the practical things.
[03:12:04.396 --> 03:12:06.759]  And that's what I'm learning how to argue with.
[03:12:06.759 --> 03:12:10.885]  Okay, let's not talk about if the Germans actually sank the Lithuania.
[03:12:10.885 --> 03:12:14.350]  Let's talk about the timing of the sinking and what it
[03:12:16.648 --> 03:12:21.531]  What ultimately happened, we got in a war, and an expensive war.
[03:12:21.531 --> 03:12:32.237]  People like to argue about whether that's Mohammed Atta's actual idea, his actual passport on the ground.
[03:12:32.237 --> 03:12:39.762]  It's like, we get off into all those little things, and we need to talk about the basics, the climate, what is really going on.
[03:12:40.482 --> 03:12:44.368]  You know, and I appreciate you.
[03:12:44.368 --> 03:12:51.558]  You must get a lot of problems, Alex, so what you guys are doing, dude, is taking a lot of problems, man.
[03:12:56.445 --> 03:13:00.726]  Yeah, but no, I mean, I've gotten to where I'm driving home, that's when he's on, like 6, 7 at night.
[03:13:00.726 --> 03:13:06.508]  I used to go home about 5, see the kids come back, and I listen to him, and you hear the callers going.
[03:13:06.508 --> 03:13:07.708]  He's a well-meaning guy.
[03:13:07.708 --> 03:13:19.131]  I'm not talking about him, he had a financial, a black financial expert on, and they were taking calls, and it was just, I listened for like 30 minutes, I think it was Monday, and caller after caller was talking about how
[03:13:20.171 --> 03:13:25.114]  A nice black voice would call up, they'd say, come down, they'd have black brokers, but it's working for a big global company.
[03:13:25.114 --> 03:13:28.996]  And they'd think, oh, this is nice black folks, I'm going to change my mortgage, and they were ripping them off.
[03:13:28.996 --> 03:13:32.679]  I mean, my whole point is, a black guy will mug you, a white guy will mug you.
[03:13:32.679 --> 03:13:37.982]  And I'm telling you right now, Barack Obama, you know, just like all white people aren't evil, well, all white people aren't good either.
[03:13:37.982 --> 03:13:39.163]  Well, all black people aren't good.
[03:13:39.163 --> 03:13:43.285]  I'm telling you right now, Obama is new world order and is selling this agenda.
[03:13:43.285 --> 03:13:46.527]  Well, listen, it's very exciting to have had you on, Patrice O'Neal.
[03:13:46.527 --> 03:13:47.548]  Thank you.
[03:13:47.548 --> 03:13:49.609]  Any things you need to plug so folks can find out about you?
[03:13:50.396 --> 03:13:58.678]  Uh, you just go to MySpace or, you know, Google me and, uh, you know, and look for my... If you go to MySpace, it has all my tour dates.
[03:13:58.678 --> 03:14:09.360]  I'm not on any television now, so it's just basically I'm touring around the country, and most of my stuff is being on shows like yours, doing a little radio, and I appreciate you having me, man.
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:11.041]  Well, sir, we look forward to you being on tomorrow night.
[03:14:11.041 --> 03:14:11.541]  I'll be listening.
[03:14:11.541 --> 03:14:11.981]  God bless you.
[03:14:12.588 --> 03:14:13.428]  Thank you.
[03:14:13.428 --> 03:14:13.929]  Take care.
[03:14:13.929 --> 03:14:16.450]  Great having him on an amazing hour interview we just did.
[03:14:16.450 --> 03:14:17.450]  I got him on 15 minutes late.
[03:14:17.450 --> 03:14:18.771]  That was perfect to hold him over.
[03:14:18.771 --> 03:14:27.214]  I apologize to our next guest, but we got behind today, and that's Brian Garish, former naval officer and anti-submarine warfare expert.
[03:14:27.214 --> 03:14:35.398]  Brian Garish to discuss common purpose, a sinister quasi-political charity that has infiltrated the UK power structure as part of its agenda to re-engineer society.
[03:14:35.398 --> 03:14:41.681]  Garish will also discuss the preparation for martial law and staged riots that also ties the Obama national security issue.
[03:14:41.681 --> 03:14:41.821]  Now,
[03:14:43.075 --> 03:15:01.130]  Hitler did this, Stalin did this, Mao did this, they're setting it up here, and it ties into the Tattletale squads, it ties in, these people are working for intelligence agencies, they're put in key positions, and it's like NGOs at the UN, and they can point at them and go, that's what the people want, that's our group.
[03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:05.613]  So it's literal intelligence infiltration of your society, of your country.
[03:15:06.738 --> 03:15:36.478]  and uh... common purpose re-engineering UK for a new world order and there's a video we've got up of this the amazing uh... brian uh... garish uh... he really knows what he's doing is we've got all this research separately and and and and now i was in england videotaping us on the street cops walked up what's your name i put you in a terror database you're not allowed to videotape in london uh... but they had cameras on us uh... steve watson that runs prison planet dot com and prison planet dot tv you know as a masters of political science out with his girlfriend taking her out to eat
[03:15:36.898 --> 03:15:39.020]  They line him up, line up folks, take their IDs.
[03:15:39.020 --> 03:15:59.040]  This is getting you used to living under this, and later in the interview, I'm going to get into this article Steve Watson wrote, where it says if somebody has a cell phone, if you see soap bottles, soap detergent bottles, and it shows in somebody's trash they may be a terrorist, if they have a van, if they have a backpack, if they have a still camera, if they have a computer,
[03:15:59.900 --> 03:16:01.422]  Now, it's the same stuff here in the U.S.
[03:16:01.422 --> 03:16:05.004]  It says blue jeans, cell phones, you're nice to police.
[03:16:05.004 --> 03:16:06.085]  I've read the manuals.
[03:16:06.085 --> 03:16:12.270]  It's meant to make police and the public paranoid of everybody, so we think terrorists are hiding, but the state, it will help us.
[03:16:12.270 --> 03:16:16.253]  And it's come out that MI5, MI6 illegally spy on the Parliament.
[03:16:16.253 --> 03:16:21.818]  You have the shadow government run by the elites, same here, overthrowing the real government like PDD 51.
[03:16:23.559 --> 03:16:24.479]  That's my pleasure.
[03:16:24.479 --> 03:16:25.640]  Thank you for inviting me.
[03:16:45.891 --> 03:16:47.632]  Again, I apologize for getting you on late.
[03:16:47.632 --> 03:16:48.553]  You've got the floor.
[03:16:48.553 --> 03:16:54.717]  Break down how you learned about this, why you're involved, why you've been on some UK television speaking out against this.
[03:16:54.717 --> 03:17:00.041]  Go over what this common purpose is and how this nexus is in with the Stasi.
[03:17:00.041 --> 03:17:00.661]  Right, okay.
[03:17:00.661 --> 03:17:06.045]  Well, for you listeners that don't know me, I'm an ex-naval officer.
[03:17:06.045 --> 03:17:09.507]  I left the Navy as a lieutenant commander.
[03:17:09.507 --> 03:17:10.508]  Set up in business.
[03:17:11.408 --> 03:17:19.011]  Eventually I became what I call comfortable and I started to look at trying to help some of the local community.
[03:17:19.011 --> 03:17:35.097]  Deprived areas, unemployment, general picture of decline and together with some other people we tried to set up a training course to give particularly younger people skills training and jobs.
[03:17:35.097 --> 03:17:36.418]  Initially everything went well.
[03:17:37.495 --> 03:17:44.498]  And then when we were supposed to apply for some grant funding, it was like a door was shut in our faith.
[03:17:44.498 --> 03:18:05.569]  So all of the public bodies that we had been talking to suddenly stopped talking to us, whether it was the City Council or Development Agencies or Quangos or the local Chamber of Commerce, the contact all stopped and it was just like a door shut.
[03:18:05.569 --> 03:18:05.789]  And we
[03:18:06.832 --> 03:18:16.639]  We thought this was strange, but we just decided to press on with the project ourselves because we had support from local people, a lot of support.
[03:18:16.639 --> 03:18:22.804]  And then we, in a very short space of time, we started to be threatened.
[03:18:22.804 --> 03:18:27.447]  And initially it was suggestions that we should stop the project.
[03:18:27.447 --> 03:18:35.173]  And then when we didn't stop it, it became late night knocks on the door, threats, death threats, arson attempts.
[03:18:36.287 --> 03:18:38.628]  And, uh, bricks through windows.
[03:18:38.628 --> 03:18:56.912]  Now, we couldn't understand what was happening, and, uh, one evening I was asked to go and meet a man, and I did, and he said to me, you're having problems, and I said yes, and he asked me, did I know what was causing it, and I said no, and he said to me, I think it's common purpose.
[03:18:56.912 --> 03:19:01.894]  Now, I'd never heard of the organization, so I asked him to tell me more.
[03:19:01.894 --> 03:19:03.674]  He said he'd rather not.
[03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:09.612]  And that was a very strange answer from somebody who'd apparently asked to see me.
[03:19:09.612 --> 03:19:17.856]  But I realised that the man was very nervous, and I tried to get information from him, but he wouldn't tell me much more.
[03:19:17.856 --> 03:19:20.197]  So I eventually left.
[03:19:20.197 --> 03:19:24.599]  We did discuss some things about the city, Plymouth, where I live.
[03:19:24.599 --> 03:19:29.081]  But I came home and looked at a website for an organisation called Common Purpose.
[03:19:30.286 --> 03:19:37.148]  And what I found was an organization which was talking about creating future leaders in society.
[03:19:37.148 --> 03:19:38.289]  All right, stay there.
[03:19:38.289 --> 03:19:38.829]  Stay there, sir.
[03:19:38.829 --> 03:19:40.089]  We have the same thing here.
[03:19:40.089 --> 03:19:44.451]  Back when I was a mainline conservative, I would try to build a veteran a house because they were going to tear it down.
[03:19:44.451 --> 03:19:45.771]  Suddenly, we were getting death threats.
[03:19:45.771 --> 03:19:47.311]  Police were coming up and playing close.
[03:19:47.311 --> 03:19:49.152]  Saying, do you want to attack police?
[03:19:49.152 --> 03:19:51.373]  They don't want any real community
[03:19:52.273 --> 03:19:56.235]  Activism, because that brings sovereignty and local control.
[03:19:56.235 --> 03:20:00.877]  And in England, in Europe, in Australia, in the U.S., they go after everybody.
[03:20:00.877 --> 03:20:01.317]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.317 --> 03:20:02.998]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:20:02.998 --> 03:20:04.759]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:20:04.759 --> 03:20:07.440]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:20:07.440 --> 03:20:12.563]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:20:12.563 --> 03:20:15.764]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:20:15.764 --> 03:20:19.086]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[03:20:19.665 --> 03:20:32.212]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:20:32.212 --> 03:20:34.214]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:20:34.214 --> 03:20:35.935]  I use one every day.
[03:20:35.935 --> 03:20:38.396]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:20:38.776 --> 03:20:44.378]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:21:08.078 --> 03:21:16.187]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:21:16.187 --> 03:21:21.774]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[03:21:22.102 --> 03:21:24.342]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[03:21:24.342 --> 03:21:29.443]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:21:29.443 --> 03:21:34.664]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:21:34.664 --> 03:21:39.005]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:21:39.005 --> 03:21:40.105]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:40.105 --> 03:21:44.606]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[03:21:49.511 --> 03:21:52.493]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:21:55.796 --> 03:22:07.406]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:07.406 --> 03:22:12.670]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:13.271 --> 03:22:19.753]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:19.753 --> 03:22:21.733]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:21.733 --> 03:22:24.194]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:22:24.194 --> 03:22:35.096]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:22:37.381 --> 03:22:39.042]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:39.042 --> 03:22:40.902]  It's about a one world government.
[03:22:40.902 --> 03:22:47.825]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:22:56.088 --> 03:22:57.648]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:57.648 --> 03:22:58.849]  The people strike back.
[03:23:00.496 --> 03:23:04.198]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:23:04.198 --> 03:23:09.922]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:23:09.922 --> 03:23:14.265]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:23:14.265 --> 03:23:16.726]  Nature's Gem Premium Omega-3.
[03:23:16.726 --> 03:23:22.690]  Unlike other flaxseed, our Golden Flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:23.530]  We're good to go!
[03:23:51.960 --> 03:23:54.407]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[03:23:54.407 --> 03:23:54.628]  That's 800-387-5516.
[03:23:54.628 --> 03:23:55.310]  Free shipping included.
[03:24:03.527 --> 03:24:04.628]  We're back live.
[03:24:04.628 --> 03:24:06.609]  The same thing's being done here in the U.S.
[03:24:06.609 --> 03:24:12.774]  The state police, the Army, we got the documents last week, we called and they confirmed it, are in the Fed protest.
[03:24:12.774 --> 03:24:16.777]  We had Army intelligence watching us that said we were basically terrorists.
[03:24:16.777 --> 03:24:20.440]  Ron Paul's a terrorist, you know, all the supporters are terrorists.
[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:24.383]  All their community organizing's okay and federally run, but anything else...
[03:24:25.484 --> 03:24:26.685]  They go after.
[03:24:26.685 --> 03:24:29.066]  And that's what our guest is saying is going on with this Common Purpose.
[03:24:29.066 --> 03:24:29.886]  We're learning more about it.
[03:24:29.886 --> 03:24:31.687]  Steve Watson's written a story about it.
[03:24:31.687 --> 03:24:33.828]  They're clearly going into a Stasi society.
[03:24:33.828 --> 03:24:36.589]  Sir, please continue with what you were covering.
[03:24:36.589 --> 03:24:38.430]  Brian Nagarish.
[03:24:38.430 --> 03:24:38.670]  Right.
[03:24:38.670 --> 03:24:54.297]  Well, Alex, the first thing I'll just say in reply to your comments about the close down, this was one of the key things that we really began to understand later, is that a simple community project, which is going to get people trained,
[03:24:54.830 --> 03:25:00.313]  Get pride back and get people earning money and a pride in their community.
[03:25:00.313 --> 03:25:02.214]  They don't want that.
[03:25:02.214 --> 03:25:04.855]  And that is the reason the project was closed down.
[03:25:04.855 --> 03:25:07.076]  I'm very sure that was the reason.
[03:25:07.076 --> 03:25:14.659]  They don't want people to be proud, to be well fed and well organized.
[03:25:14.659 --> 03:25:21.903]  But if I continue the story, once we discovered Common Purpose, particularly myself and another
[03:25:23.010 --> 03:25:28.634]  Military man started to research it in a professional way.
[03:25:28.634 --> 03:25:40.223]  And we were just amazed to find that an organization we'd never heard of was everywhere in the city, in Plymouth, in the southwest of England.
[03:25:40.223 --> 03:25:46.428]  It was even in the Chamber of Commerce, which I was working with, and yet those people never declared themselves.
[03:25:46.428 --> 03:25:52.292]  It was in the police, it was in the local authority, it was in the government bodies, it was in the hospitals.
[03:25:53.047 --> 03:26:00.890]  And at that stage, the head teacher of every school in Plymouth was also Common Purpose trained.
[03:26:00.890 --> 03:26:19.578]  Now, when we were able to look at key documents, and that my colleague here was able to see documents where Common Purpose was talking about controlling a host city, if you could actually recruit and train a few key people in a city,
[03:26:20.290 --> 03:26:24.011]  Those in positions of power, you could actually control the city.
[03:26:24.011 --> 03:26:38.473]  So if you have the chief executive of the local authority, if you have the planning officer, if you have the legal officer, if you have the head of police, in that way, you could actually start to steer the policy.
[03:26:38.473 --> 03:26:43.754]  And then they bring in more of their people, and it literally takes over.
[03:26:43.754 --> 03:26:48.975]  That is absolutely it, because if I can try and just sum this up for people,
[03:26:49.531 --> 03:27:05.194]  If you imagine an Amway type system, and I know that you know Amway, pyramid selling, but instead of pyramid selling, what you're doing is pyramid recruiting of people into this common purpose.
[03:27:05.194 --> 03:27:11.175]  And what they are doing is training them in a particular way to go and train others.
[03:27:11.175 --> 03:27:19.157]  Now, we are pretty sure that what they're doing is neuro-linguistic programming, but it means that once people are brought on board,
[03:27:20.137 --> 03:27:29.202]  They will select the ones who have the greatest influence and power, and they are the ones who they will then groom to control things.
[03:27:29.202 --> 03:27:34.925]  And by the way, it's admitted that Obama is doing all these little mind tricks in everything he does.
[03:27:34.925 --> 03:27:43.469]  Now, I've seen articles that Common Purpose is now involved in these 60,000 community spies that the government's called for.
[03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:47.411]  Well, that was something that came out in the press a few days ago, that 50,000
[03:27:49.573 --> 03:27:51.995]  I will call them low-grade officials.
[03:27:51.995 --> 03:28:02.902]  We're going to be used to report on people, and we're now starting to see people such as traffic wardens being given powers of arrest.
[03:28:02.902 --> 03:28:17.471]  And I can tell you that one of our strong supporters, who's a lovely lady from Germany, she's in her 80s, and she will tell us that every single step she sees happening in the UK at the moment
[03:28:17.910 --> 03:28:22.191]  She saw happening as the Nazis came to power.
[03:28:22.191 --> 03:28:36.975]  She was bombed out in Hamburg and she is literally pulling her hair out saying, why can't people see that exactly the same system is establishing itself in the United Kingdom?
[03:28:37.537 --> 03:28:38.778]  Well, we have that in Austin.
[03:28:38.778 --> 03:28:44.502]  We have these federally controlled groups and they're intelligence agencies and they'll be at a restaurant and they'll just walk right over.
[03:28:44.502 --> 03:28:50.627]  The governor will walk right over when I'm at Louisville-Lyon in front of witnesses and say, you have a nice Thanksgiving, Alex.
[03:28:50.627 --> 03:28:53.689]  Then one time he was on the show and was, you know, calling me names and things.
[03:28:53.689 --> 03:28:57.873]  The point is, they are very arrogant about this and it's a good old boys club.
[03:28:58.593 --> 03:29:23.499]  And they've taken over, and you say 50,000, I saw the BBC report they were recruiting 60,000 citizens, they have InfraGard here, 50,000 executives with secret shoot-to-kill orders, that's mainstream news, 26,000 preachers in the clergy response teams, we got their secret documents a year and a half later, mainstream news confirmed it, that they are preparing us for martial law and to have their flocks go to FEMA camps, sir.
[03:29:25.098 --> 03:29:30.221]  Yes, I've seen your material and other people's material on this in the state.
[03:29:30.221 --> 03:29:31.302]  Alright, stay there, stay there.
[03:29:31.302 --> 03:29:31.963]  Long segment.
[03:29:31.963 --> 03:29:33.223]  I know we've had a lot of breaks here.
[03:29:33.223 --> 03:29:34.704]  This is the time of the show when we have them.
[03:29:34.704 --> 03:29:35.805]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:35.805 --> 03:29:36.265]  Stay there.
[03:29:36.265 --> 03:29:37.566]  Let's break this to folks.
[03:29:37.566 --> 03:29:40.588]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[03:29:40.588 --> 03:29:47.793]  This is how societies are taken over by intelligence operations and they use front charities and others to do it.
[03:29:47.793 --> 03:29:49.194]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[03:29:51.809 --> 03:29:55.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.760 --> 03:29:58.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.798 --> 03:30:04.719]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[03:30:04.719 --> 03:30:05.859]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[03:30:05.859 --> 03:30:10.040]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:14.842]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[03:30:14.842 --> 03:30:25.085]  The SinuPlus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[03:30:25.205 --> 03:30:25.685]  We're good to go.
[03:30:55.185 --> 03:30:55.826]  We're good to go.
[03:31:15.740 --> 03:31:22.322]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.322 --> 03:31:24.302]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.302 --> 03:31:26.803]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.803 --> 03:31:38.386]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.386 --> 03:31:40.067]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:40.067 --> 03:31:41.407]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.920 --> 03:31:48.824]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.824 --> 03:31:57.088]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:57.088 --> 03:31:58.669]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.669 --> 03:31:59.830]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.769 --> 03:32:03.132]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:32:03.132 --> 03:32:05.558]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:32:05.558 --> 03:32:09.707]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:32:09.707 --> 03:32:11.772]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[03:32:16.456 --> 03:32:25.865]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:32:25.865 --> 03:32:32.250]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:32:32.250 --> 03:32:35.853]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[03:32:35.853 --> 03:32:40.257]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:32:40.257 --> 03:32:40.998]  For the rest of you,
[03:32:47.261 --> 03:32:47.501]  I think so.
[03:33:04.144 --> 03:33:09.486]  You know, I haven't lived through Nazi Germany, but I've read probably, I don't know, 60, 70 books on it.
[03:33:09.486 --> 03:33:15.149]  I haven't lived through Soviet Russia, but I've read dozens of books on it, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn's The Good, Lucky Republic.
[03:33:15.149 --> 03:33:21.051]  This is how they take over, and they admit that through community groups and organizations they're taking over.
[03:33:21.051 --> 03:33:25.513]  They don't want anybody to have any power in the community under COINTELPRO and FBI documents.
[03:33:25.513 --> 03:33:28.754]  Mainline churches that aren't part of the system, they spy on them.
[03:33:28.754 --> 03:33:29.795]  Mainline groups.
[03:33:31.035 --> 03:33:32.036]  This is the control.
[03:33:32.036 --> 03:33:49.203]  This is why our society won't work, why we can't ever get communities going to change the government, because on every issue of wars and open borders and high taxes and regulations and bailouts, you'll have 70 to 99 percent, depending on the poll on those issues, the vast majority against it, but it just continues.
[03:33:50.083 --> 03:33:56.364]  Because they control the whole system and now they're going for broke and Obama's announcing they're trying to pass compulsory service.
[03:33:56.364 --> 03:33:58.845]  It's in the House and Senate right now.
[03:33:58.845 --> 03:34:01.805]  Schwarzenegger, all these homeless people, he's making them go to a camp now.
[03:34:01.805 --> 03:34:03.606]  I'm sending reporters to California.
[03:34:03.606 --> 03:34:04.826]  That's Bloomberg Financial.
[03:34:04.826 --> 03:34:07.107]  You can't sleep on the street or in your car now.
[03:34:07.107 --> 03:34:11.107]  You gotta go to the place where all the drug addicts and everybody else are at with your family.
[03:34:11.107 --> 03:34:12.788]  CPS will be there grabbing your kids.
[03:34:14.028 --> 03:34:16.389]  But England, I mean, it is really bad.
[03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:34.913]  I've got a lot of friends and people in England, two folks that work with me, and Watson was looking at his town, and all the common purpose people are also in the anti-terror operations now, and that's in Sheffield, same thing in London, going back to Brian Garish, and that's how this happens.
[03:34:34.913 --> 03:34:40.334]  You try to get involved in the community, and you just run into this brick wall of these people,
[03:34:40.994 --> 03:34:42.435]  And it's happening all over the nation.
[03:34:42.435 --> 03:34:45.056]  So, sir, continue with the new revelations.
[03:34:45.056 --> 03:34:51.200]  There's starting to be some press now, and they're admitting, oh, common purpose is going to help the government, and Obama's doing the same thing.
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:52.640]  Please continue.
[03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:54.561]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:34:54.561 --> 03:35:03.966]  It's very interesting that the subject of common purpose is now coming into the media because they're having to defend themselves.
[03:35:03.966 --> 03:35:08.569]  And they're having to defend themselves because more and more ordinary people
[03:35:09.164 --> 03:35:11.146]  They're asking simple questions.
[03:35:11.146 --> 03:35:13.508]  They're asking what they're doing.
[03:35:13.508 --> 03:35:17.731]  They're asking why public money is being used to pay for them.
[03:35:17.731 --> 03:35:25.617]  And they're asking why a so-called charity is acting politically in order to change society.
[03:35:25.617 --> 03:35:31.222]  Now one thing I think you said just then Alex is that these people are in control.
[03:35:32.451 --> 03:35:38.055]  I'd like to say that we're at a very important point because they are nearly in control.
[03:35:38.055 --> 03:35:38.896]  Yes.
[03:35:38.896 --> 03:35:43.900]  And what we have to do is make sure that they don't finally close the door.
[03:35:43.900 --> 03:35:51.625]  We know that they're not in control yet because if they were, you and I would not be speaking on this line.
[03:35:51.625 --> 03:35:59.411]  So what we've got to do is to start getting people to wake up and actually see what is happening in their society.
[03:36:00.222 --> 03:36:13.266]  Now one of the key things that has been done in the United Kingdom is that the whole of the government system, and I mean the proper system of government, has been pushed to the side.
[03:36:13.266 --> 03:36:22.230]  And what is happening is that the country is being driven by a new sector which is called the third sector.
[03:36:22.230 --> 03:36:29.212]  And this comprises organisations like Common Purpose and charities and partnerships
[03:36:29.889 --> 03:36:30.129]  I think?
[03:36:47.825 --> 03:36:49.887]  You don't know what's happening anymore.
[03:37:06.445 --> 03:37:08.606]  Well, that is absolutely true.
[03:37:08.606 --> 03:37:13.469]  I can tell you that from the best information that I've gotten, other people working closely with me, recently,
[03:37:35.397 --> 03:37:47.081]  The British Army was asked, troops were asked individually whether they would be prepared to open fire on British people on the streets of Britain.
[03:37:47.081 --> 03:38:00.325]  And so it is absolutely obvious at the moment when the government tells us that they're expecting violence on the street by the summer, they're expecting it because they are creating it.
[03:38:00.325 --> 03:38:04.086]  We have a criminal elite in power.
[03:38:04.907 --> 03:38:10.749]  And they now want to ramp up the violence because that enables the close down of the police laws.
[03:38:10.749 --> 03:38:11.569]  And there's good news!
[03:38:11.569 --> 03:38:12.489]  I want you to continue.
[03:38:12.489 --> 03:38:13.849]  I want to back you up.
[03:38:13.849 --> 03:38:15.650]  Denver, Colorado.
[03:38:15.650 --> 03:38:16.630]  We were there.
[03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:21.471]  We couldn't prove it was police dressed like anarchists attacking other police and staged events.
[03:38:21.471 --> 03:38:22.632]  But we said we believed it.
[03:38:22.632 --> 03:38:29.014]  Then the Denver Post reported the police admit they attacked other police on news cameras to demonize all protest.
[03:38:29.014 --> 03:38:30.014]  We caught them last year.
[03:38:30.954 --> 03:38:39.786]  At the Global Summit in Ottawa, Canada, and they were there with police dressed up attacking other police.
[03:38:39.786 --> 03:38:40.768]  That was confirmed.
[03:38:40.768 --> 03:38:46.836]  People noticed their boots were the same as the police, you know, with the same yellow decal, and they had to confirm the Royal Mounted Police were doing that.
[03:38:47.777 --> 03:38:57.426]  We know that the bankers fund through foundations, these rent-a-mobs, who will go out and do this, and it's been confirmed, as you said, they're preparing for martial law in the U.S.
[03:38:57.426 --> 03:38:57.926]  and in England.
[03:38:57.926 --> 03:38:58.807]  That's mainstream news.
[03:38:58.807 --> 03:39:00.308]  It's been in memos.
[03:39:00.308 --> 03:39:01.970]  They asked the Marines, will you fire at U.S.
[03:39:01.970 --> 03:39:02.410]  citizens?
[03:39:02.410 --> 03:39:04.873]  They're suddenly putting military in all major police departments.
[03:39:05.473 --> 03:39:08.114]  As liaison officers, that's being announced.
[03:39:08.114 --> 03:39:09.535]  And look at Gordon Brown.
[03:39:09.535 --> 03:39:18.619]  He swore to let there be a Parliament vote on EU entrance, but then he forgo that and went ahead and introduced it anyways and is now doing it.
[03:39:18.619 --> 03:39:19.879]  Again, this is tyranny.
[03:39:19.879 --> 03:39:22.640]  They won't let the Brits vote on entering the EU or not.
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:24.141]  Go ahead.
[03:39:24.141 --> 03:39:25.261]  That's certainly true.
[03:39:25.261 --> 03:39:33.805]  Well, it's obvious that Mr. Brown lied at every opportunity, and his intention is clearly to lock us into the European Union.
[03:39:34.585 --> 03:39:40.107]  But if I can just bring you back, because we are in a very, very serious position.
[03:39:40.107 --> 03:39:49.830]  All of the things you've talked about with the martial law and the searches and the 50 or 60,000, I'll call them Gestapo, being prepared.
[03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:51.531]  That's all happening.
[03:39:51.531 --> 03:39:56.893]  But we need to also try and concentrate on what people can do.
[03:39:56.893 --> 03:40:03.995]  And one thing which I think you will agree with me is the number of people who are actually controlling things
[03:40:04.835 --> 03:40:05.116]  I don't
[03:40:18.484 --> 03:40:20.546]  Then the other side has no chance.
[03:40:20.546 --> 03:40:23.889]  They're very frightened of the sheer volume of people.
[03:40:23.889 --> 03:40:25.331]  Compartmentalization.
[03:40:25.331 --> 03:40:26.212]  You said the key.
[03:40:26.212 --> 03:40:27.273]  You're right.
[03:40:27.273 --> 03:40:33.899]  Even most of the minions in these groups believe the propaganda, believe there's terrorists everywhere, believe they've got to dig through their neighbors' garbage.
[03:40:33.899 --> 03:40:38.744]  They want us all against each other because they're a very small group that's compartmentalized.
[03:40:38.744 --> 03:40:40.906]  With exposure, they'll fall like a house of cards.
[03:40:40.906 --> 03:40:41.307]  Continue.
[03:40:41.889 --> 03:41:09.385]  Yeah, well, one of the things that we've discovered is that as we've stuck to a message, which is to explain to people why nothing works in the country, and we've stuck to a message as how it's being done, so we've exposed common purpose, we're exposing members of the government, and then we are showing people that by digging and getting the activities to the surface,
[03:41:10.100 --> 03:41:12.541]  Something very special is happening.
[03:41:12.541 --> 03:41:22.563]  If you take the British police force, it is absolutely untrue that all the police are part of this new agenda.
[03:41:22.563 --> 03:41:30.385]  There are a large number of very good people in the police force, but at the moment they don't understand what's happening around them.
[03:41:30.385 --> 03:41:36.646]  So our job is to get in amongst them, to give them the truth, and to wake them up.
[03:41:36.646 --> 03:41:38.667]  And that is exactly the same in the military,
[03:41:40.094 --> 03:41:41.876]  And it's the same in the government.
[03:41:41.876 --> 03:41:44.479]  What we've got to do is get in amongst
[03:41:45.501 --> 03:41:50.805]  the organizations and start spreading the message.
[03:41:50.805 --> 03:41:53.126]  Brian Garish from England, exposing Common Purpose and others.
[03:41:53.126 --> 03:41:56.969]  Again, you're facing the same globalist crime syndicate that we're facing.
[03:41:56.969 --> 03:42:04.113]  We're facing the exact same attack formation, same programs rolled out at the same time, and what you're saying you're doing with success, we're doing.
[03:42:04.113 --> 03:42:14.080]  We have police and military sending us secret documents every week that make national news, how they're spying on the American people for no reason, good Americans, how the war on terror is really meant
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:19.362]  Well, the first thing is, those of you who know the truth about what is happening, you've really got to tell people.
[03:42:19.362 --> 03:42:21.282]  It doesn't matter whether they laugh at you.
[03:42:21.282 --> 03:42:21.903]  Some of them will.
[03:42:44.355 --> 03:42:57.044]  Some of the people will turn away from you, but you are only interested in the people who believe you, because the people who believe will go away and spread the message.
[03:42:57.044 --> 03:43:02.588]  And our task is to wake up millions of people.
[03:43:02.588 --> 03:43:09.974]  And we need to tell them that if they don't wake up, millions of people are going to die, including millions of children.
[03:43:10.507 --> 03:43:18.310]  I have no doubt that is going to happen in the UK, and I have no doubt it's going to happen in the United States.
[03:43:18.310 --> 03:43:20.611]  So don't be shy with the message.
[03:43:20.611 --> 03:43:25.292]  Tell them, and you will find people will come on board.
[03:43:25.292 --> 03:43:27.753]  And when they say, what can they do?
[03:43:27.753 --> 03:43:29.834]  You say the same thing.
[03:43:29.834 --> 03:43:32.275]  Tell other people.
[03:43:32.275 --> 03:43:36.476]  I believe that the waking up of people is an exponential curve.
[03:43:37.205 --> 03:43:41.888]  We've been for years on the flat bit, so nothing seems to happen.
[03:43:41.888 --> 03:43:49.152]  But I'm now quite optimistic because we're just at the curve before it really starts to go.
[03:43:49.152 --> 03:44:00.759]  And if I think it's the same in America, somebody in one state has a good joke, and in three days, everybody in America has heard the good joke.
[03:44:00.759 --> 03:44:06.843]  That's what we need to do about the message that a vicious dictatorship is being imposed
[03:44:07.847 --> 03:44:30.062]  But the other thing you can do if you want to start the dialogue is to talk to people about the money situation because a lot of people have been hurt by the banking collapse and just tell them that every organization that's up to no good is supported by the international banking elite because that's a fact.
[03:44:30.062 --> 03:44:31.863]  But it's waking people up.
[03:44:31.863 --> 03:44:33.604]  So be positive.
[03:44:33.604 --> 03:44:34.365]  Tell the truth.
[03:44:35.288 --> 03:44:39.331]  And you've got to be friends with other people.
[03:44:39.331 --> 03:44:41.353]  They want to split us up.
[03:44:41.353 --> 03:44:43.454]  They want white against black.
[03:44:43.454 --> 03:44:46.757]  They want Christian against Muslim against Jew.
[03:44:46.757 --> 03:44:48.778]  They want the lot.
[03:44:48.778 --> 03:44:51.940]  So we have to stand together as people.
[03:44:51.940 --> 03:44:55.363]  And when people stand together, they are very frightened.
[03:44:56.499 --> 03:44:57.260]  That's my message.
[03:44:57.260 --> 03:44:59.181]  Alright, let me go over some points here.
[03:44:59.181 --> 03:45:00.622]  I've got to have you back.
[03:45:00.622 --> 03:45:05.005]  And give out any websites or contact for folks who want to help you in England counter this.
[03:45:05.005 --> 03:45:06.466]  And don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[03:45:06.466 --> 03:45:07.186]  You are the leader.
[03:45:07.186 --> 03:45:08.287]  You are the solution.
[03:45:08.287 --> 03:45:10.328]  This is classical hardcore tyranny.
[03:45:10.328 --> 03:45:13.591]  We have the government's documents scientifically taking over.
[03:45:13.591 --> 03:45:19.935]  The reason the same thing's happening in Germany, the same thing's happening in China, the same thing's happening in Australia, England, U.S.
[03:45:19.935 --> 03:45:22.016]  because it's the same international banking cartel.
[03:45:22.016 --> 03:45:23.157]  They brag about it.
[03:45:23.157 --> 03:45:24.058]  Now here's the issue.
[03:45:24.458 --> 03:45:33.864]  The enemy wants a fake grassroots movement, and their counterfeit is big and powerful on the surface, but it's very, very weak when you stand up to it.
[03:45:33.864 --> 03:45:36.265]  True grassroots is invincible.
[03:45:36.265 --> 03:45:38.727]  This is total resistance.
[03:45:38.727 --> 03:45:40.208]  And so understand, he's right.
[03:45:40.208 --> 03:45:45.251]  Everybody instinctively, just like mice know when a hurricane's coming two days before, you know, or birds.
[03:45:45.251 --> 03:45:46.792]  We have that too.
[03:45:46.792 --> 03:45:49.374]  Intellectually, they can go find it, but instinctively,
[03:45:50.222 --> 03:45:51.863]  People know what's happening.
[03:45:51.863 --> 03:45:59.450]  And the Globalists use a complex psychological warfare op where they know everybody's scared and they say, you're scared because terrorists are everywhere.
[03:45:59.450 --> 03:46:01.311]  And your neighbors probably want.
[03:46:01.311 --> 03:46:03.213]  See, the enemy's very smart.
[03:46:03.213 --> 03:46:05.494]  They know people instinctively are going, I'm in danger.
[03:46:06.275 --> 03:46:08.697]  Because we're in danger of this Hitlerian system.
[03:46:08.697 --> 03:46:09.578]  We have to go, no, no.
[03:46:09.578 --> 03:46:12.000]  The reason you're upset is, look at the tyranny.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:13.201]  Look who's doing all the bad things.
[03:46:13.201 --> 03:46:15.403]  Look at who's bankrupting things by design.
[03:46:15.403 --> 03:46:19.386]  And yes, start by talking about the financial collapse and how they're taking over.
[03:46:19.386 --> 03:46:26.232]  And even if we don't stop them at this juncture, as it gets worse and worse, all the seeds you planted in people's minds will then sprout.
[03:46:26.232 --> 03:46:33.859]  Those that turn away and walk away and laugh, they won't be laughing soon, unfortunately, because the globalists are planting a mass cull, like in Soviet Russia,
[03:46:34.199 --> 03:46:35.880]  I've seen the attack pattern in history.
[03:46:35.880 --> 03:46:36.540]  This is it.
[03:46:36.540 --> 03:46:38.501]  This is the signature, the wavelength.
[03:46:38.501 --> 03:46:40.022]  We know what this animal is.
[03:46:40.022 --> 03:46:43.284]  It is the worst possible tyranny you can imagine.
[03:46:43.284 --> 03:46:48.026]  It is the worst system we could even imagine.
[03:46:48.026 --> 03:46:49.467]  This is hell on earth.
[03:46:49.467 --> 03:46:52.749]  Now, the enemy knows that
[03:46:53.809 --> 03:46:55.311]  Again, the people are waking up to them.
[03:46:55.311 --> 03:47:00.696]  So that's why they're trying to accelerate their plan, and that weakens them, because haste makes waste.
[03:47:00.696 --> 03:47:01.918]  Now, I'm going to try to shut up, sir.
[03:47:01.918 --> 03:47:06.742]  You just really are spurring me to speak, because, you know, we're two guys who've never talked before and we're on the same page.
[03:47:06.742 --> 03:47:07.904]  How do folks contact you?
[03:47:07.904 --> 03:47:08.704]  How do they get involved?
[03:47:08.704 --> 03:47:14.610]  How do they fight this in England, where, I mean, folks, it's secret police everywhere, lining you up, getting you used to being asked questions.
[03:47:15.271 --> 03:47:20.594]  I mean, Russia isn't this bad in the Cold War, from folks I've talked to that are now in England that were in Foreign Service.
[03:47:20.594 --> 03:47:23.795]  I mean, this is like Russia, and they're trying that here.
[03:47:23.795 --> 03:47:24.956]  So how do we get involved?
[03:47:24.956 --> 03:47:26.857]  How do we continue to fight it?
[03:47:26.857 --> 03:47:36.222]  Right, well, if I can, I'd like to mention some websites, which mean that America can come and have a look at what we're doing.
[03:47:36.222 --> 03:47:44.266]  So the first one I'd like to give you is www.cpexposed.com.
[03:47:47.029 --> 03:47:49.771]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:49.771 --> 03:47:50.831]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:47:50.831 --> 03:47:51.231]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:51.231 --> 03:47:51.872]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:47:51.872 --> 03:47:52.412]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:52.412 --> 03:47:53.193]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:47:53.193 --> 03:47:53.573]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:53.573 --> 03:47:54.473]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:47:54.473 --> 03:47:55.154]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:55.154 --> 03:47:56.394]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:47:56.394 --> 03:47:57.015]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:57.015 --> 03:47:58.255]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:47:58.255 --> 03:47:59.556]  CPExposed.com.
[03:47:59.556 --> 03:48:00.617]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:00.617 --> 03:48:01.197]  CPExposed.com.
[03:48:01.197 --> 03:48:02.378]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:02.378 --> 03:48:03.338]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:03.338 --> 03:48:04.179]  CPExposed.com.
[03:48:04.179 --> 03:48:05.099]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:05.099 --> 03:48:06.400]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:07.320]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:08.301]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:08.301 --> 03:48:09.482]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:09.482 --> 03:48:11.343]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:11.343 --> 03:48:11.923]  CommonPurposeExposed.com.
[03:48:11.923 --> 03:48:13.044]  CommonPurposeExposed.com
[03:48:26.925 --> 03:48:46.049]  And also we had a conference back in February where we just said let us see what happens when we start telling the truth and we had 500 people very quickly in one location so we're now going for a much bigger one in London.
[03:48:46.781 --> 03:49:04.935]  And the site for that is www.thebcgroup.org.uk.
[03:49:04.935 --> 03:49:07.317]  And I'd also like to mention another gentleman.
[03:49:07.317 --> 03:49:11.400]  He's an ex-Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy.
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:13.702]  And his name is Gerald Atkinson.
[03:49:15.194 --> 03:49:23.842]  And he is running a website which is www.newtotalitarian.com.
[03:49:23.842 --> 03:49:36.134]  Now, I have only recently come across this guy, but he's been doing some fantastic work in showing how the American military is being mind-controlled
[03:49:36.707 --> 03:49:38.928]  Boy, sensitivity training.
[03:49:38.928 --> 03:49:40.469]  Yeah, let me explain to people.
[03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:42.350]  The government documents it in college.
[03:49:42.350 --> 03:49:47.753]  They admit that they're using subliminals, other systems on TV, and that they are.
[03:49:47.753 --> 03:49:50.154]  Sensitivity training is re-education.
[03:49:50.154 --> 03:49:54.236]  And that's what the new national draft is in the U.S., is forced education.
[03:49:54.236 --> 03:49:59.039]  And it's literally in these groupthink, peer pressure systems, bringing in control.
[03:49:59.039 --> 03:50:02.001]  In the final segment, I'm going to have you back very, very soon, sir.
[03:50:02.001 --> 03:50:03.001]  I'm very impressed.
[03:50:03.001 --> 03:50:05.703]  Because all the time, when you get other folks on, like yourself, and we just click,
[03:50:06.463 --> 03:50:16.705]  But I wanted you to talk about what is it like for you, a patriot, a military officer, and I notice it's a lot of times military folks that are fighting this, because you recognize an intelligence op, a takeover op.
[03:50:16.705 --> 03:50:21.186]  What was it like for you when you woke up to this with your view of England, your view of the world?
[03:50:21.186 --> 03:50:27.707]  Well, it's been a big shock for me because I've had to completely relearn a lot of things that I've believed in.
[03:50:27.707 --> 03:50:34.228]  I will say to you now that I no longer believe that the intelligence services in this country
[03:50:34.776 --> 03:50:36.237]  ...are defending Britain.
[03:50:36.237 --> 03:50:38.639]  I believe they're part of the problem.
[03:50:38.639 --> 03:50:47.024]  So I've had to look at every aspect of the world around me and decide now what's true and what's not true.
[03:50:47.024 --> 03:50:51.907]  And ordinary American people are going to have to do this as well.
[03:50:51.907 --> 03:50:52.928]  Yeah, stay there.
[03:50:52.928 --> 03:50:55.089]  We've got to decide which side we're on.
[03:50:55.089 --> 03:50:56.310]  Folks, just choose a side.
[03:50:56.310 --> 03:50:58.911]  Are you on the New Orleans side or Liberty's side?
[03:50:58.911 --> 03:51:00.112]  Choose now.
[03:51:00.112 --> 03:51:01.093]  Choose wisely.
[03:51:01.889 --> 03:51:05.333]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:51:05.333 --> 03:51:09.597]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:51:09.597 --> 03:51:17.565]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:51:17.825 --> 03:51:18.265]  We're good to go!
[03:51:47.725 --> 03:51:52.786]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:51:52.786 --> 03:51:56.967]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.218 --> 03:52:20.699]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.699 --> 03:52:22.680]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.680 --> 03:52:25.140]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.140 --> 03:52:38.323]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.323 --> 03:52:40.004]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.004 --> 03:52:41.364]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.869 --> 03:52:48.777]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.777 --> 03:52:57.046]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.046 --> 03:52:58.607]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.607 --> 03:52:59.789]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.308 --> 03:53:05.489]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[03:53:05.489 --> 03:53:09.131]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[03:53:09.131 --> 03:53:12.952]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[03:53:12.952 --> 03:53:16.193]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[03:53:16.193 --> 03:53:23.816]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology that holds in and reflects your own body heat.
[03:53:24.056 --> 03:53:25.737]  Soothing those sore areas.

[03:53:28.419 --> 03:53:32.622]  And increases blood flow to the affected areas without the use of toxic chemicals.
[03:53:32.622 --> 03:53:38.466]  Imagine being able to finally relieve the aches and pains in your elbows, knees, wrists, back, and more.
[03:53:38.466 --> 03:53:41.048]  So forget about messy creams that have an unpleasant smell.
[03:53:41.368 --> 03:53:43.789]  Try Solartherm, the pain care you wear.
[03:53:43.789 --> 03:53:44.469]  Call them today at 1-877-747-6664.
[03:53:44.469 --> 03:53:44.789]  That's 1-877-747-6664.
[03:53:44.789 --> 03:53:46.630]  Or visit them online at solartherm.ca.
[03:53:46.630 --> 03:53:48.250]  That's solar, T-H-E-R-M, solartherm.ca.
[03:54:03.607 --> 03:54:12.471]  It is our right, it is our duty to organize and to control our governments under the Magna Carta Bill of Rights Constitution in England and the United States.
[03:54:12.471 --> 03:54:16.793]  And worldwide, it's a basic human right.
[03:54:16.793 --> 03:54:20.315]  You don't get it from laws, you innately have it, but those laws are there.
[03:54:20.315 --> 03:54:32.501]  Notice how all of their charities, all of their groups are policing, spying, controlling, going after freedom, trying to raise taxes, and then demonizing anybody who's involved, anybody who speaks up for sovereignty or liberty.
[03:54:34.144 --> 03:54:36.585]  And notice how they say Obama's supposed to bring good race relations.
[03:54:36.585 --> 03:54:45.110]  Actually, he's going to represent the New World Order agenda, so when you criticize him, they'll then say, oh, that's racism, as they are now, to create and heighten division.
[03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:47.052]  This is how they control us.
[03:54:47.052 --> 03:54:49.113]  Just an amazing interview with Brian Garish.
[03:54:49.813 --> 03:54:59.964]  And you can find out more at the websites like cpexposed.com, ukcolumn.org, thebcgroup.org, and we really appreciate them coming on.
[03:54:59.964 --> 03:55:04.789]  I'll have you back up for a couple hours here in the next few weeks because this is the takeover.
[03:55:04.789 --> 03:55:07.692]  They know if they've got the grassroots, they can win.
[03:55:07.692 --> 03:55:11.096]  And every time we try to declare state sovereignty, which is in the Tenth Amendment,
[03:55:11.976 --> 03:55:17.080]  Well Alex, the one thing I wanted to come back to is doing things and there are two more people I'd like to mention.
[03:55:17.080 --> 03:55:18.962]  One is a guy called John Harris.
[03:55:41.787 --> 03:55:42.027]  I don't
[03:56:06.272 --> 03:56:06.932]  I don't
[03:56:30.171 --> 03:56:32.832]  Your listeners go and look.
[03:56:32.832 --> 03:56:34.052]  Yeah, I've been meaning to get him on.
[03:56:34.052 --> 03:56:36.873]  I mean, that's a similar system to the Declaration of Independence.
[03:56:36.873 --> 03:56:40.334]  We're not slaves to the Queen, to this whole corporate maritime administration.
[03:56:40.334 --> 03:56:42.374]  That really is how this whole thing works.
[03:56:42.374 --> 03:56:49.136]  I've been meaning to get him back on, but finishing up here, they are brainwashing the military and police.
[03:56:49.136 --> 03:56:57.319]  Well, they are brainwashing particularly military and police, but it also goes through into the schools, which is particularly dangerous.
[03:56:57.319 --> 03:56:58.859]  But what we are now finding
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:25.602]  Is that by giving talks and the videos that have gone out on the internet that we have sent out, by giving talks about how the brainwashing works and what changes you see in people, we're finding it difficult to cope now with the number of people who call us every day telling us that since they've heard our message, they can see it.
[03:57:26.363 --> 03:57:27.707]  They literally call me.
[03:57:27.707 --> 03:57:30.395]  I must have had a hundred calls today.
[03:57:30.395 --> 03:57:32.180]  That's just through to me.
[03:57:32.180 --> 03:57:34.226]  Most of them I can't... I can't take.
[03:57:35.014 --> 03:57:37.315]  But the people are saying, I see it.
[03:57:37.315 --> 03:57:37.695]  I see it.
[03:57:37.695 --> 03:57:38.575]  Well let me stop you.
[03:57:38.575 --> 03:57:39.696]  It's all in government documents.
[03:57:39.696 --> 03:57:43.497]  It's been in the British News where they tell them, oh kids, you're going to play spy.
[03:57:43.497 --> 03:57:47.299]  Don't tell your parents, thumbprint, that it's a laser scanner illegally.
[03:57:47.299 --> 03:57:50.780]  And it happened all over the nation in one week period, what, two years ago.
[03:57:50.780 --> 03:57:53.041]  I mean, these are government training camps.
[03:57:53.041 --> 03:57:55.842]  And Time Magazine for Kids says your parents are bad.
[03:57:55.842 --> 03:57:58.203]  They train kids here how to spy on their parents.
[03:57:58.203 --> 03:57:59.043]  We're going to have to have...
[03:58:01.244 --> 03:58:11.001]  Is, for instance, when people are disturbed because they see police becoming more brutal, they're becoming dehumanized.
[03:58:11.468 --> 03:58:14.129]  This is the effect of sensitivity training.
[03:58:14.129 --> 03:58:17.591]  And that's happening in America, it's happening in the United States.
[03:58:17.591 --> 03:58:17.731]  Okay.
[03:58:43.345 --> 03:58:46.748]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:59:04.243 --> 03:59:08.967]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.167 --> 03:59:10.307]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.307 --> 03:59:13.549]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
