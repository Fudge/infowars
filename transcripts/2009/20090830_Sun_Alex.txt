[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.052]  ...can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[00:00:04.052 --> 00:00:05.813]  Food is your only ammunition.
[00:00:05.813 --> 00:00:07.014]  How much do you want?
[00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:08.135]  When do you want it?
[00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:10.016]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:11.097]  When will you need it?
[00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:13.298]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:14.619]  Will there be any food?
[00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.160]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.424]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:25.006]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.469]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.050]  How much will you need?
[00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.951]  We don't know.
[00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.052]  How much do you want?
[00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:32.972]  All you can get.
[00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:34.073]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:37.115]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:37.636]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.317]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:40.338]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:41.539]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.020]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:09.961]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:11.583]  You want answers?
[00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:12.464]  Well, so does he.
[00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:17.311]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:21.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:31.853]  Well, well, well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and we are also live.
[00:01:31.853 --> 00:01:35.076]  Glad that you have joined us.
[00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:48.910]  It is Sunday, the 30th day of August 2009, and we are going to be live here for the next two hours with an incredibly, incredibly
[00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:52.210]  Important broadcast.
[00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.591]  Number one, I can't believe that we're almost up to the 8th anniversary of 9-11.
[00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.452]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:01.432]  Time just flies.
[00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:06.213]  We do have some big news coming up this year, in and around 9-11.
[00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:09.654]  Just a little heads up to folks, a word of the wise.
[00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:11.974]  This is just amazing how
[00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:25.195]  All the issues we talked about over a decade ago and got called kooks are now just mainstream news, and the media just has debates about whether it's a good thing or not.
[00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:35.959]  And so not only do we cover the news, we unravel how they spin, how they manipulate, the different tricks that we've learned that the establishment dinosaur media uses.
[00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:58.795]  Here's one, Cheney says cooperation with CI Probe will depend, and you read the Reuters story, he's saying that he's basically above the law, and that he may not comply with a presidential investigation, or congressional investigation for that matter, or justice department investigation, saying he's above the law.
[00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:01.816]  His own fourth branch of government.
[00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.537]  Not just saying the executive's above the law.
[00:03:05.691 --> 00:03:08.333]  Well he's not above state grand juries.
[00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:09.194]  No one is above the law.
[00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:20.405]  No one is allowed to say kidnap children and roast them as suckling hogs and put an apple in their mouth on the Thanksgiving Day table.
[00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.106]  It's very simple.
[00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:27.492]  The President, the Vice President, Adolf Hitler for that matter, Mao Zedong, they're not above the law.
[00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:30.557]  But the media's spinning this.
[00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:40.327]  Oh, will Obama prosecute the CIA guys that did a drill by somebody's head, threatening to drill their head with it and blowing smoke in their face?
[00:03:40.327 --> 00:03:45.552]  And then the fake conservatives get on talk radio and say, we're going to do something about this.
[00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:47.013]  How dare Obama?
[00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:48.335]  He's not protecting us.
[00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:50.557]  The terrorists are going to hit us.
[00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:52.058]  Obama is protecting.
[00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:53.935]  The White House.
[00:03:53.935 --> 00:04:02.199]  They've got to burn a few low-level people for petty things like a drill, which is terrorizing and threatening to kill somebody.
[00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.461]  I mean, it is a hardcore form of psychological terrorism.
[00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:29.591]  Terrorizing somebody, but it's nothing compared to the Army's own four-year-old report that they raped children with objects dripping with battery acid, and raped women in front of their husbands, and that 97% of people taken to Abu Ghraib and other camps in Iraq were totally innocent, and that the White House memos ordered them to do it.
[00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:36.637]  Congress, four years ago, saw the footage of this, not just the Army's report, and decided to do nothing.
[00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:43.822]  So see, you better hope they talk about drills all day, and threatening people with a drill.
[00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:51.046]  You better hope they divert you off into that, because if they get into the real stuff, they're going to bring all the real criminals to justice.
[00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:58.830]  So all you little fake neocons who've been busy destroying this country, and now you've handed the baton off to Obama, you guys make me sick.
[00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.731]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.283]  And then the other news is just unbelievable.
[00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:06.087]  Huge economic developments.
[00:05:06.087 --> 00:05:11.094]  Huge swine flu developments.
[00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:14.900]  And of course, Bill would give President emergency control of the internet.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.603]  I've been talking about this for eight months.
[00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:36.256]  In fact, Bush was proposing this before Obama even got in, and so yes, we're going to break down the plan to end free speech in America and to federalize the internet, but it's finally in CNET News, it's finally on Drudge, it's finally on ABC Nightly News, finally people are calling me asking, why aren't you covering this more?
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.083]  Kind of like asking me why haven't I ever talked about 9-11 when I'm the father of the 9-11 truth movement and talked about it two months before it happened.
[00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.104]  Yes, we're going to cover that.
[00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:53.546]  And Media Matters and National Media are attacking me, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck.
[00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:54.227]  Why?
[00:05:54.227 --> 00:05:56.748]  Why are they mixing me in with those two guys?
[00:05:56.748 --> 00:05:57.908]  We'll explain it all.
[00:05:57.908 --> 00:05:59.149]  Important show!
[00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.649]  Lined up!
[00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.450]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.452]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:04.433]  Well, you should.
[00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:08.917]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:09.717]  That's right.
[00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:18.405]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:19.746]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.887]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:06:21.087 --> 00:06:27.070]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.974]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:39.497]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:40.958]  This is real.
[00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:41.998]  Don't miss out.
[00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:48.862]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:06:49.102 --> 00:06:50.563]  And get your free handgun.
[00:06:50.563 --> 00:06:52.923]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:56.625]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:06:56.625 --> 00:07:01.526]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:08.149]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.150]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:14.428 --> 00:07:15.808]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:20.269]  We're going to have open phones coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:23.270]  We'll give you that toll-free number at that time.
[00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.631]  We've got roughly two hours spanning out before us.
[00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:29.111]  I'm here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:34.892]  Central Standard Time, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas.
[00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:42.734]  We can be heard on 590 AM, KLBJ here in Austin, and other great affiliates from San Francisco, California,
[00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:45.395]  To Buffalo, New York.
[00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:48.737]  From Chicago, Illinois to Miami, Florida.
[00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:50.658]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:54.800]  Coming to you via the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.941]  Okay, let me just mention the stacks I've got here.
[00:07:57.941 --> 00:07:59.222]  You wanna know the bottom line?
[00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:04.765]  What's really happening with all this news about Cheney and torture?
[00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:06.886]  And blocking investigations of torture.
[00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:10.868]  And Obama saying he's gonna look into threatening people with power drills.
[00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:13.921]  You want to know what's really happening?
[00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.707]  Obama's running a whitewash of this while posing.
[00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:20.948]  As if he's actually trying to prosecute these crimes.
[00:08:20.948 --> 00:08:23.329]  The torture is continuing.
[00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:26.972]  So it's all part of this false left drive paradigm that is coming up.
[00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:28.953]  But I'll do that next hour.
[00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:31.035]  I've got a big stack of economic news.
[00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:35.378]  The head of the New York Business School, Robini, who I want to get back on, by the way.
[00:08:35.378 --> 00:08:36.999]  He's been on this quite a few times.
[00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:44.424]  He's saying governments are already reaching the point where they're borrowing to pay for interest on their borrowing a global Ponzi scheme.
[00:08:46.135 --> 00:09:00.073]  Also, Inside Science, big scientific prestigious journal, has done its own computer analysis of who owns the world's derivatives and banks, and it's less than five global banks.
[00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.978]  Yes, the New World Order, and they run the entire scam and have more wealth
[00:09:05.433 --> 00:09:08.414]  Hundreds of times more wealth than there is in all the world.
[00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.914]  That is real assets.
[00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:14.075]  That's why they have to have a global depression to get your real wealth.
[00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.476]  They've made unlimited fake money.
[00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:21.077]  But they're mad because they can't get your house, your farm, your roads, your business.
[00:09:21.077 --> 00:09:23.478]  Well, they are under the New World Order.
[00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:28.179]  So, we're going to be going over the total tyranny of these bastards.
[00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:29.300]  Another headline here.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:29.620]  N.M.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.461]  Rothschild pitches motorway privatization plans.
[00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.721]  See, they bankrupt government.
[00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:40.329]  And now, just like third world countries, over 90% of the U.S.
[00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:48.555]  and British and other western world countries of your taxes are gonna go to private banks to pay interest on fiat money they made up.
[00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:49.255]  You understand?
[00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:56.721]  When we bail the banks out, we gotta pay them interest for the money we give them, and then we become their slaves for giving them all our money.
[00:09:56.721 --> 00:10:01.324]  I mean, I always talk about this because just the magnitude of it.
[00:10:03.086 --> 00:10:11.069]  But again, they've got all these yuppies by the short hairs, and they tell them, oh, you won't get your 401k, you won't get your retirement unless you stick with this.
[00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:15.031]  And they hold you all hostage while they devalue your dollar.
[00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.631]  But you love it, that's why you're idiots.
[00:10:16.631 --> 00:10:18.332]  So, fine, have it your way.
[00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:29.516]  Drink some more fluoride, go take the flu shot, you know, drink out of plasticware, you know, wonder why you look like a woman, and you know, when you're 40 years old.
[00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:30.957]  It's just fine, you want that, go ahead.
[00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:34.392]  So we'll be going over that also.
[00:10:34.392 --> 00:10:39.374]  TSA may hand cash rewards to tipsters about crimes or security violations.
[00:10:39.374 --> 00:10:43.735]  Turning everybody into tattletales.
[00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:47.215]  And a bunch of other important news.
[00:10:47.215 --> 00:10:50.376]  Fluoride linked to arthritis, study shows.
[00:10:50.376 --> 00:10:55.737]  Other major studies show that vaccines are linked to early onset of arthritis.
[00:10:55.737 --> 00:10:57.598]  But again, doesn't matter what the facts are.
[00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:02.619]  We made the Toronto Star front page of their metro section.
[00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:06.860]  The Obama posters are by the tens of thousands, the reporter told me.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.261]  They just said every major street is lined with them.
[00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:11.841]  They asked, I mean, is this some type of invasion?
[00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:14.322]  And I said, yes, of freedom.
[00:11:14.322 --> 00:11:26.545]  The ObamaInfoWars.com, Obama Socialism, Obama New World Order posters are plastering from Tokyo, Japan, to Berlin, Germany, from London, England, to Austin, Texas.
[00:11:26.545 --> 00:11:27.345]  My sister said St.
[00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:33.527]  Edwards, where she goes to college, she's a lot younger than me, and also talked to her.
[00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:36.209]  She said she was down at UT at a party and they were all over the place.
[00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:38.230]  So good job, Austin.
[00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.090]  It's just global.
[00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:47.035]  And again, an example of people taking action, getting involved, going out and saying, I'm not part of the left-right paradigm.
[00:11:47.035 --> 00:11:51.958]  I see through your corporate president, Barack Obama.
[00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.981]  So we'll be going over some of that as well today.
[00:11:57.156 --> 00:12:05.638]  I want to direct your attention though to a CNET story, CNET News, put out by Declan McCullough, that we've had him on many times.
[00:12:05.638 --> 00:12:07.198]  Let's get him on this week.
[00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:14.160]  Declan McCullough, Bill would give President emergency control over the internet.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.981]  And I was out of town on Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:24.324]  And I noticed my email box, the comment sections, phone calls were, Alex, are you going to cover this?
[00:12:24.324 --> 00:12:28.946]  Yes, we've been beating our head against a wall covering it every week.
[00:12:28.946 --> 00:12:31.867]  The Cyber Security Act.
[00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:35.588]  Obama for eight months has been giving speeches about it.
[00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:39.210]  The Pentagon, and we've written articles about this, and the Air Force,
[00:12:40.444 --> 00:12:47.871]  And the San Antonio News tried to go out and show one of the big NSA bases they're building and the cops came out and said, in America you can't show this.
[00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:48.791]  And they said, what's the law?
[00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.353]  And they said, we have guns.
[00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.815]  That's the law, slave.
[00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:58.420]  But they're building these bases all over the country and by federal law
[00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:04.329]  They want to make every internet system, every server, you pay for it.
[00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:07.773]  And you pass it on to your customers, I guess.
[00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:10.535]  Have a piece of government equipment plugged into it.
[00:13:10.535 --> 00:13:24.128]  Just like with the Telecommunications Act of 96, $9 billion was given of taxpayer money to AT&T and others to put whole floors of their buildings, or to build buildings next door to their main buildings.
[00:13:25.523 --> 00:13:34.251]  Where the NSA openly reads every email, every fax, every phone call with keyword software listening.
[00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:40.177]  And of course, that was all in the Telecommunications Act, and people called it a conspiracy theory when I talked about it.
[00:13:40.177 --> 00:13:45.262]  Then, 10 years later, in 2008, I guess more than 10 years later, 12 years later,
[00:13:52.492 --> 00:14:01.297]  They report, oh yes, all over the country, entire floors of every IT building, every phone company, are NSA.
[00:14:01.297 --> 00:14:03.599]  See, the phone company is the NSA.
[00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:11.023]  And that's all this is, but this will cost, they're saying, maybe a hundred billion, just to put it in, and tens of billions a year.
[00:14:11.023 --> 00:14:19.028]  Even the smaller IT companies, smaller servers, everything, will have a government-approved pieces of equipment coupled to it,
[00:14:19.628 --> 00:14:32.054]  Where they can shut you off, they can spy at will, they have all the codes and back doors to your systems openly with, and they're really already doing most of this, but this is because Microsoft's a government front.
[00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:33.435]  That's come out totally.
[00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:34.456]  Bill Gates runs nothing.
[00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.096]  That's just a complete front.
[00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:45.621]  They can't have the government openly running things, so they set up IBM as a front, Microsoft as a front, and then that's actually part of the corporate records if you go research it, but side issue.
[00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:50.183]  Microsoft's really like a Planned Parenthood front.
[00:14:50.183 --> 00:14:53.387]  It's like a foundation mainly to raise money for Planned Parenthood.
[00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:54.289]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:55.991]  You didn't know that Gates' daddy runs it?
[00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:58.896]  But side issue.
[00:14:58.896 --> 00:15:00.077]  Same with IBM.
[00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:03.910]  The main funders of Hitler, of course.
[00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:10.294]  And then when the old man died in the 50s, he gave his money and said the Tax-Free Foundation had to be for carrying out eugenics.
[00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:14.797]  If you don't know what eugenics is, you better find out!
[00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:17.378]  When you're drinking tap water, you're enjoying a little eugenics.
[00:15:17.378 --> 00:15:19.320]  Let me just, let me give you the low-down.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.181]  The down-low.
[00:15:21.181 --> 00:15:23.802]  The DL, baby.
[00:15:23.802 --> 00:15:25.864]  Truth's a lot stranger than fiction, I'll assure you.
[00:15:26.755 --> 00:15:31.096]  But Bill would give President emergency control of the Internet.
[00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:34.757]  And they've now got a diversity chairman over the Internet.
[00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:37.797]  And they're saying the FCC is going to run the Internet now.
[00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:44.459]  And they've got more than 10 senators I've seen in the last few months saying they are going to try to shut down talk radio and free speech.
[00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:56.341]  They're going to have a tax on radio, online radio as well, where you're going to have to fund NPR, which is National Petroleum Radio, not National Public Radio, openly run by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, the eugenicists.
[00:15:58.564 --> 00:16:01.485]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:10.207]  And so when we get back, I want to go over how they're taking over the internet and how they're going to end the free open internet as you know it.
[00:16:10.207 --> 00:16:13.708]  But before we go to break, a very simple piece of this is Google Phone.
[00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:15.548]  Tens of millions signed up for it.
[00:16:15.548 --> 00:16:18.669]  Basically free phone service in the country you live in.
[00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:19.689]  Very cheap.
[00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:21.310]  Less than a cent a minute overseas.
[00:16:23.035 --> 00:16:32.142]  Well, Apple, iPhone, and AT&T don't allow you to contact any of their phones or their phone system with a Google phone.
[00:16:32.142 --> 00:16:33.624]  That's how they shut the web down.
[00:16:33.624 --> 00:16:37.627]  That's how they shut the internet down, is by just blocking off the addresses.
[00:16:37.627 --> 00:16:42.031]  But they want physical control over the infrastructure itself.
[00:16:42.998 --> 00:16:54.385]  With, quote, the government having the power to kill the internet to save it, and the Pentagon again admitted they've been attacking their own systems and then blaming it on foreign governments as a pretext to pass this bill.
[00:16:54.385 --> 00:17:00.149]  And if this bill doesn't pass, look for a false flag fake internet attack to get it passed in the next few months.
[00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:05.775]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:09.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.706]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:20.772]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.772 --> 00:17:21.273]  Number three,
[00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:27.981]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.865]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:35.410]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.015]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:17:39.235 --> 00:17:44.961]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:49.666]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:03.885]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:09.210]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.272]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:18:11.272 --> 00:18:16.257]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:18:16.257 --> 00:18:17.178]  How much do you want?
[00:18:17.438 --> 00:18:18.559]  When do you want it?
[00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.440]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.521]  When will you need it?
[00:18:21.521 --> 00:18:23.723]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:25.064]  Will there be any food?
[00:18:25.064 --> 00:18:26.585]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:18:26.585 --> 00:18:31.849]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:35.452]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:38.915]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:18:39.255 --> 00:18:40.476]  How much will you need?
[00:18:40.476 --> 00:18:41.377]  We don't know.
[00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:42.498]  How much do you want?
[00:18:42.498 --> 00:18:43.419]  All you can get.
[00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:44.521]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:47.564]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:49.345]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:18:49.345 --> 00:18:50.266]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:04.153]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:06.154]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:19:06.154 --> 00:19:14.682]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:19:14.682 --> 00:19:20.226]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:21.848]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:19:22.068 --> 00:19:28.592]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:19:28.592 --> 00:19:39.640]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.420]  That's right.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.982]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:44.803]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:19:44.803 --> 00:19:45.063]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:19:45.063 --> 00:19:46.244]  Or visit acolablue.com.
[00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:53.269]  We're good to go.
[00:20:14.784 --> 00:20:23.210]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:30.655]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:20:36.699 --> 00:20:42.283]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:57.644]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:21:14.241 --> 00:21:17.366]  Everything is done because of an emergency.
[00:21:17.366 --> 00:21:22.574]  Homeland Security and NORTHCOM was set up to fight Al Qaeda after the emergency of 9-11.
[00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:23.516]  It really wasn't.
[00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:25.699]  It was covertly set up in the early 1990s.
[00:21:25.699 --> 00:21:29.184]  Close to a decade before.
[00:21:31.969 --> 00:21:46.752]  And now, oh, because the Russians and Chinese are attacking the Internet, they have to take over every local computer network and system by federal law and force everyone to go under government specs and control the architecture of the Internet's development.
[00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:47.292]  And guess what?
[00:21:47.292 --> 00:21:52.394]  They're going to force it onto Internet, too, and shut down the old web and the new Internet.
[00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:57.415]  This is all stated by government and private consortiums in their own Internet, too, yearly meetings.
[00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:58.015]  You can go read the
[00:21:58.715 --> 00:22:01.399]  minutes of these meetings, if you want, and the transcripts.
[00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:02.881]  It's public.
[00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:05.864]  Their slogan is, the Internet is dead.
[00:22:05.864 --> 00:22:07.607]  The Internet is dead.
[00:22:07.607 --> 00:22:10.711]  Internet 2 lives.
[00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:13.875]  Internet 2 is basically like cable on Internet.
[00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:15.095]  We're good.
[00:22:35.134 --> 00:22:48.102]  Promotes criminal activity, you know, government libraries, citizen paid for libraries, and oh, InfoWars isn't allowed on the European train systems on the quote free government Wi-Fi.
[00:22:48.102 --> 00:22:49.523]  So they're now phasing it in.
[00:22:49.523 --> 00:22:56.708]  They get you addicted to the web, they make the whole system convert to the web, and then they shut off the free web and hoard it all for themselves.
[00:22:58.504 --> 00:23:00.506]  And they're going to do it if you let them.
[00:23:00.506 --> 00:23:11.995]  And they're going to tax and regulate all forms of free speech, and quote, then, use the money to fund government TV and radio and internet.
[00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:14.017]  These are some sick, sick bastards.
[00:23:14.017 --> 00:23:17.780]  See, the parasite needs the alternative media.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:23.665]  And so it's just going to restrict us, attack us, but then everybody will still fight to get to us, so then they're going to tax us.
[00:23:23.665 --> 00:23:25.266]  I mean, this is all introduced.
[00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:26.307]  This is all announced.
[00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:33.465]  Uh, the FCC diversity chief is what he's called, diversity czar, is on video.
[00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:35.847]  We may play this later if we have time, it's up on info.
[00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:41.432]  We're saying we need systems like Hugo Chavez has, where he just shuts down whenever he wants.
[00:23:41.432 --> 00:23:43.794]  That's the new America!
[00:23:43.794 --> 00:23:45.095]  And it's bipartisan!
[00:23:47.455 --> 00:23:59.143]  You watch, when Obama leaves, all these police state things on free speech are going to be kept by the new fake right-wing government, and suddenly all these right-wing hosts will be, well, the Democrats are the ones that set it up, they don't like their own medicine.
[00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:01.725]  See how they play that game?
[00:24:01.725 --> 00:24:10.310]  Whereas if we would just be for the Bill of Rights and Constitution across the board, and the rule of law across the board, this could all stop.
[00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:15.234]  Bill would give President emergency control of Internet, Internet companies and civil liberties groups.
[00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:18.055]  How about just people who love freedom?
[00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:20.335]  We're alarmed this spring when a U.S.
[00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:28.398]  Senate bill proposed, and by the way, we have the clip of Senator Jay Rockefeller saying, we need to end the internet, we'd be better off without it.
[00:24:28.398 --> 00:24:31.519]  I mean, they're saying they're ending it!
[00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:34.900]  And they say, oh, this is the power to end it, but only to save it.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.580]  And they're gonna say the Russians attack it.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:52.603]  I mean, like, oh, Air Force One might get hacked, or somebody hacked Marine One, and then it turned out it was the Pentagon, and the Pentagon's bragging in consortium meetings in San Antonio.
[00:24:52.603 --> 00:24:57.264]  We've posted the minutes where the Air Force publishes going, we need to attack U.S.
[00:24:57.264 --> 00:25:01.364]  bloggers, they're part of the enemy, and we may need to even kill U.S.
[00:25:01.364 --> 00:25:03.005]  journalists in America.
[00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:04.205]  I mean, these guys get up,
[00:25:05.117 --> 00:25:06.177]  In fact, people won't believe that.
[00:25:06.177 --> 00:25:06.577]  Google.
[00:25:06.577 --> 00:25:08.198]  Pentagon says they may need to kill U.S.
[00:25:08.198 --> 00:25:09.438]  journalists.
[00:25:09.438 --> 00:25:19.721]  And then you can go to the Air Force saying it's not enough to have the Army watching me and Ron Paul and it being in the Baltimore Sun that they follow in the Fed protest.
[00:25:19.721 --> 00:25:23.562]  I mean, folks, the government is completely criminal and owned by offshore banks.
[00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:27.123]  And they told you NORTHCOM was for Al Qaeda.
[00:25:27.123 --> 00:25:33.567]  No, the power drills and the acid and the rape rooms are for you, the person that owns a farm or ranch.
[00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:35.308]  It's for you that owns a company.
[00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:37.490]  This is about tyranny, people!
[00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.512]  A lot of Germans found out, though.
[00:25:41.512 --> 00:25:45.195]  See, Hitler tested his stuff out on the Jews and gypsies and people he didn't like.
[00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:46.596]  But then he moved on to everybody else.
[00:25:46.596 --> 00:25:47.596]  That was his real target.
[00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:51.179]  But you'll find out, you'll find out, because you wouldn't stand up for America.
[00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:56.424]  Internet companies and civil liberties groups were alarmed this spring when a U.S.
[00:25:56.424 --> 00:26:02.129]  Senate bill proposed handing the White House the power to disconnect private sector computers from the Internet.
[00:26:02.129 --> 00:26:06.012]  Oh, yes, the government will disconnect your computers!
[00:26:06.012 --> 00:26:10.035]  And they've also pinned the Pentagon's journalist vetting program.
[00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:13.698]  I think you just found the article about them killing people.
[00:26:13.698 --> 00:26:15.319]  No, no, that's not it.
[00:26:15.319 --> 00:26:16.801]  It's another story where the Pentagon said
[00:26:17.662 --> 00:26:20.863]  That they're going to quote, the Pentagon says U.S.
[00:26:20.863 --> 00:26:23.503]  bloggers enemies to be treated as enemies.
[00:26:23.503 --> 00:26:33.805]  And then those stories, there's a whole bunch of them six months ago or so, then linked to the actual transcripts where they say, we need to start killing Americans in America.
[00:26:33.805 --> 00:26:36.086]  Of course, Cheney already had hit teams doing that.
[00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:42.047]  So Al Qaeda, how about people he wanted, he was competing with for contracts?
[00:26:42.047 --> 00:26:44.648]  Yeah, that's what the real hit squads are for.
[00:26:44.648 --> 00:26:46.048]  People that companies are up against.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.402]  They're not much happier about revised version.
[00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:56.226]  Aides to Senator Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, have spent months drafting behind closed doors.
[00:26:56.226 --> 00:27:07.715]  Yes, CNET News has obtained a copy of the 55-page draft, they have a link to it, which appears to permit the President to seize temporary control of private sector networks during so-called cyber security emergency.
[00:27:07.715 --> 00:27:10.196]  Yeah, CNET just broke this Friday.
[00:27:10.196 --> 00:27:11.958]  How do we all know about this?
[00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:13.219]  Eight months ago.
[00:27:13.219 --> 00:27:21.486]  Because the Pentagon wrote the draft, we wrote the stories about it and posted them on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:21.486 --> 00:27:26.311]  And we're Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes tooting our horns.
[00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.392]  That's what we're not good at.
[00:27:27.392 --> 00:27:30.574]  We need to do it more because we know what we're talking about.
[00:27:30.574 --> 00:27:38.682]  Our listeners pointed out these Pentagon white papers about how they wanted to take over the internet for dominance in America to shut down freedom of speech.
[00:27:40.054 --> 00:27:50.767]  And now they've announced that the Pentagon wants 400,000 regular army troops, the source on that's AP and the Hill newspaper, to quote, deal with American gun owners and returning vets.
[00:27:50.767 --> 00:27:55.292]  The whole anti-Al Qaeda system is for the red, white, and blue!
[00:27:55.292 --> 00:27:57.034]  It's to take down the country!
[00:27:57.034 --> 00:27:59.097]  We've been hijacked by foreign banks!
[00:28:00.956 --> 00:28:02.337]  What is it you can't get?
[00:28:02.337 --> 00:28:06.779]  I know the military's full of good men and women, but they're slowly twisting you to accept this.
[00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:08.020]  And you know they are.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.881]  It's time to wake up and say no.
[00:28:10.881 --> 00:28:13.783]  So they're kicking all the good military out and hiring illegal aliens to fill the ranks.
[00:28:13.783 --> 00:28:15.624]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:28:15.624 --> 00:28:18.045]  The biggest new group of people's illegal aliens and felons.
[00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:30.818]  Again, a new 55-page secret bill that's been leaked, which still appears to permit the president to seize temporary control of private sector networks during a so-called cyber security emergency.
[00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:37.789]  The new version would allow the President to declare a cybersecurity emergency relating to non-governmental computer networks.
[00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:46.111]  See, notice when you went for the Cash for Clunkers program, that it said on there, the government's now taking control of your computer.
[00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:48.732]  It's now owned in perpetuity by the government.
[00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:54.273]  Look, if you just lay down like a jellyfish to corruption, the government is nothing but an overlay.
[00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:59.966]  The mining drill bit of offshore corporations and banks.
[00:28:59.966 --> 00:29:01.106]  Mafia.
[00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:07.868]  And we're known as gullible suckers that'll allow people to cheat us and steal from us at any and all levels.
[00:29:07.868 --> 00:29:10.428]  And so they're just going to rape us en masse.
[00:29:10.428 --> 00:29:12.229]  You got that?
[00:29:12.229 --> 00:29:16.649]  And they can play you off left versus right to dissipate all your real energy.
[00:29:16.649 --> 00:29:23.691]  That's why the media will only report on Democrats being booed off the stage, not that all the major Republicans are being booed off the stages as well.
[00:29:26.072 --> 00:29:33.435]  The new version would allow the President to declare a cybersecurity emergency related to non-governmental computer networks and do what's necessary to respond to the threat.
[00:29:33.435 --> 00:29:46.980]  Other sectors of the proposal include a federal certification program for cybersecurity professionals and a requirement that certain computer systems and networks in private sector be managed by people who have been awarded the license, who are basically federal spooks.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.702]  This was already most of the new major grants and
[00:29:53.348 --> 00:29:55.269]  Scholarships for the last eight years.
[00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:58.212]  They've been gearing up for this in a big way.
[00:29:58.212 --> 00:30:00.693]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.693 --> 00:30:05.897]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:05.897 --> 00:30:09.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.844]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.844 --> 00:30:16.485]  It's true.
[00:30:16.485 --> 00:30:20.688]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.888 --> 00:30:21.809]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.809 --> 00:30:27.436]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:30:27.436 --> 00:30:28.116]  Number 4.
[00:30:28.116 --> 00:30:31.020]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.684]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:34.684 --> 00:30:35.545]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.545 --> 00:30:39.149]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:45.093]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:49.796]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.796 --> 00:30:51.577]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:01.686]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.686 --> 00:31:03.668]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:31:03.668 --> 00:31:04.309]  Well, you should.
[00:31:04.309 --> 00:31:09.153]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:31:09.153 --> 00:31:09.954]  That's right.
[00:31:09.954 --> 00:31:18.622]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.

[00:31:19.984 --> 00:31:21.125]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:31:21.325 --> 00:31:27.309]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:31:27.309 --> 00:31:34.193]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:31:34.193 --> 00:31:39.376]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[00:32:00.882 --> 00:32:03.885]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.885 --> 00:32:09.230]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.272]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.272 --> 00:32:16.277]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.277 --> 00:32:17.198]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.438 --> 00:32:18.559]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:20.460]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.521]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:23.722]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.722 --> 00:32:25.063]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:25.063 --> 00:32:26.604]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.604 --> 00:32:31.867]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:35.450]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.912]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.272 --> 00:32:40.493]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.493 --> 00:32:41.393]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:42.494]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.494 --> 00:32:43.414]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.414 --> 00:32:44.515]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.515 --> 00:32:47.577]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.577 --> 00:32:49.358]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:50.258]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:59.966 --> 00:33:05.273]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:33:05.273 --> 00:33:09.799]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:12.082]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:33:12.082 --> 00:33:13.704]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:33:13.704 --> 00:33:14.746]  There is a solution.
[00:33:14.966 --> 00:33:23.391]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:42.462]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:33:42.882 --> 00:33:47.045]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:23.112]  We can't believe that it's happening here.
[00:34:23.112 --> 00:34:36.579]  We can't believe that in our own republic, in our supposed free society, that classical tyranny is growing.
[00:34:37.386 --> 00:34:40.929]  And there's always excuses, there's always rationales.
[00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:50.918]  But Homeland Security states in its own DHS reports that their entire system, that its main focus, is the American gun owner.
[00:34:50.918 --> 00:34:52.720]  It's all for us, folks.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:35:01.287]  We've been conquered illegitimately, illegally, through fiat banking, through Ponzi schemes by offshore banks.
[00:35:01.287 --> 00:35:04.250]  And they wrap all their tyranny in the American flag, and now,
[00:35:06.107 --> 00:35:12.573]  The feds are openly saying they're taking over the entire internet and even your small IT company.
[00:35:14.844 --> 00:35:16.625]  And everything's going to be data mining.
[00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:22.406]  Everything is... I mean, the majority of new scholarships are for Homeland Security related.
[00:35:22.406 --> 00:35:24.727]  CIA radio and TV ads are everywhere.
[00:35:24.727 --> 00:35:27.968]  They're taking over our society.
[00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:32.350]  There's not going to be jobs available that aren't in those positions.
[00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:42.313]  And they're taking weak-minded people, getting them jacked up, taking them right out of the military and other places, making them CIA, making them NSA, and they think they're God.
[00:35:42.853 --> 00:35:46.734]  They think the Bill of Rights Constitution is here to be walked on.
[00:35:46.734 --> 00:35:48.095]  And they're turning them loose on us.
[00:35:48.095 --> 00:35:52.276]  And I just want to warn everybody, this is real.
[00:35:52.276 --> 00:35:58.338]  If you ever wanted to stand up for the Republic, if you ever wanted to fight tyranny, this is it.
[00:35:58.338 --> 00:36:03.579]  Now, I know there's a lot of good people in the police, in the military, and even in the CIA and FBI.
[00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:04.699]  They send us a lot of material.
[00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:08.480]  A lot of information that turns out to be accurate.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.221]  And very, very damning to the establishment.
[00:36:12.455 --> 00:36:14.836]  That's why they're trying to grow this huge new crop.
[00:36:14.836 --> 00:36:20.377]  That's why they're creating all these new agencies with new people and new directives.
[00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:24.879]  And they're going to be massive purges of people in the system.
[00:36:24.879 --> 00:36:28.060]  Look, the government's gone bad, okay?
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:33.021]  And I want to now get into overall censorship and then start taking your phone calls in the next segment.
[00:36:33.021 --> 00:36:34.322]  The toll-free number to join us is 888.
[00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:38.138]  You want to know where we stand?
[00:36:38.138 --> 00:36:38.659]  It's with 1776.
[00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:41.240]  You want to stand with 1984 and all the tyranny?
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:41.561]  Go right ahead.
[00:37:09.078 --> 00:37:18.821]  And it goes on to Larry Clinton, President of the Internet Security Alliance, saying this is a total takeover of the Internet.
[00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:22.982]  The Carnegie Mellon University admitting that it's total tyranny.
[00:37:22.982 --> 00:37:25.423]  I mean, it's just all right here.
[00:37:25.423 --> 00:37:26.383]  So there's no more
[00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:32.384]  No more denial about the Feds taking over the Internet.
[00:37:32.384 --> 00:37:55.276]  And by the way, Yahoo and Google, they helped set up the spying systems and the Internet shutdown systems in the last 15 years in Tehran, Iran, in Beijing, China, in these countries where this type of censorship goes on.
[00:37:55.276 --> 00:37:55.597]  Okay?
[00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:04.194]  Look, Homeland Security seven years ago didn't hire Marcus Wolff, the former head of the East German Stasi, the worst spies ever.
[00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:11.739]  I mean, and I didn't believe it when I saw it in the news, and I went and saw the federal congressional funding of over a million bucks over two years for Marcus Wolff.
[00:38:12.728 --> 00:38:24.199]  And then now, you read in the news every day where they're training neighbors how to spy on neighbors, and they announce, come to the local FBI meeting, come to the local Homeland Security meeting, come to the InfraGard meeting.
[00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:25.761]  We want you to fight Al Qaeda.
[00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:30.005]  Come to the Eagle Eyes meeting for, you know, now a million truck drivers that have enrolled.
[00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:58.382]  And you show up, and we've got the manuals, we've shown them on air, we've shown video clips in these seminars, and they buy you lunch, two days, at a hotel, your company sends it, you'll get a little discount on your insurance if you do, and they spend 20 minutes on Al-Qaeda, showing them at a training camp, CIA funded but don't tell you that, and then the rest of it's, is this guy drinking and driving, is this person spanking their kid, is this guy got marijuana plants in his backyard?
[00:38:58.382 --> 00:39:00.743]  It's how to spy on the American people!
[00:39:01.443 --> 00:39:06.047]  The entire infrastructure of government is to gang-rape you!
[00:39:06.047 --> 00:39:08.690]  You understand that?
[00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:09.971]  Because it isn't government.
[00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:13.514]  But look, point is, here's that censorship.
[00:39:13.514 --> 00:39:27.727]  Now, next up, every day or two, I get attacked by Media Matters, and by Daily Kos, and by ThinkProgress, and by Alternet.
[00:39:30.222 --> 00:39:44.909]  And if you go to the Federal Filings for Foundations, you can just Google, Federal Filings for Alternet, or for Daily Costs, and then you'll, it'll take you to links.
[00:39:44.909 --> 00:39:56.254]  Then it'll say, number one funder, Rockefeller Foundation, number two funder, UN, it's different for each one, number three funder, George Soros Foundation.
[00:39:56.254 --> 00:39:58.615]  I mean, I have, this is creepy,
[00:39:59.657 --> 00:40:01.797]  I have George Soros.
[00:40:01.797 --> 00:40:03.158]  I have Al Gore's foundation.
[00:40:03.158 --> 00:40:05.678]  That guy's a multi-billionaire.
[00:40:05.678 --> 00:40:11.399]  I have all these guys attacking three people.
[00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:14.240]  And this is really creeping me out.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.321]  They're attacking three people.
[00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:19.621]  And they attack me as often now.
[00:40:19.621 --> 00:40:23.642]  Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Alex Jones.
[00:40:26.107 --> 00:40:28.688]  And they are attacking me every couple days.
[00:40:28.688 --> 00:40:39.172]  I mean, I'm not even trying to pay attention to this, but I have to counter it because they always build straw men.
[00:40:39.172 --> 00:40:45.534]  Now, before I get into Limbaugh and Beck, who obviously I don't align myself with, but we're going to explain why they're doing this.
[00:40:48.632 --> 00:41:08.191]  The reason this is so creepy is, remember Poplowski who shot the three cops at his house because his mother woke him up drunk, he had pit bulls, he wouldn't get a job, wouldn't take care of the dogs, they were urinating all over the carpet and crapping everywhere, and he throws a fit, the cops show up, he shoots one, throws a fit, shoots two more.
[00:41:09.318 --> 00:41:19.745]  On his computer he visited thousands of sites like anybody else and we later, this came out in court, and we later could do searches on his handle and we first found it out this way.
[00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:24.928]  He was attacking me on the internet because I don't get into anti-semitism and racial issues.
[00:41:24.928 --> 00:41:29.131]  We're trying to bring people together against tyranny and not make it about race or religion or groups.
[00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:42.434]  Within two hours of him being in custody, the Southern Poverty Law Center, through their writer, at the local paper, the guy that writes the stories for him, said that he did it because of me.
[00:41:42.434 --> 00:41:51.356]  Now, we later got his handle and googled his name and found out he was attacking me on all the big Nazi sites that are government-run, and that's come out.
[00:41:51.356 --> 00:41:55.837]  Within two hours, folks, it turned out he'd visited CNN, Fox, every other, you know,
[00:41:56.676 --> 00:41:57.637]  He was an internet head.
[00:41:57.637 --> 00:42:00.721]  I mean, they're after me, folks.
[00:42:00.721 --> 00:42:01.982]  They're after me.
[00:42:01.982 --> 00:42:02.322]  Okay?
[00:42:02.322 --> 00:42:05.266]  And they're after Glenn Beck and they're after Rush Limbaugh.
[00:42:05.266 --> 00:42:07.688]  And they lie about everything.
[00:42:07.688 --> 00:42:16.438]  When Von Brun went and shot the security guard at the Jewish Center, they blamed Limbaugh, who is an absolute pro-Israel, all the way.
[00:42:17.321 --> 00:42:24.244]  They attack Beck, who's pro-Israel, and they attack me, and I am against a lot of the things Israel does, but I try to be even-handed with it.
[00:42:24.244 --> 00:42:33.107]  So, why is Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and Alex Jones what George Soros is thinking about, and the Rockefeller Foundation?
[00:42:33.107 --> 00:42:33.588]  Why?
[00:42:33.588 --> 00:42:37.569]  Why does Ron Paul have the army following him around, declassified?
[00:42:37.569 --> 00:42:39.790]  Why do I have the army following me around?
[00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.031]  Totally illegal!
[00:42:42.031 --> 00:42:43.972]  Well, they don't like Limbaugh and Beck,
[00:42:45.302 --> 00:42:56.465]  And I'm going to go over this in the next 30 minutes and after we take some calls, but I want to go ahead and get to the main meat of this now.
[00:42:56.465 --> 00:43:00.987]  They're going after Beck and Limbaugh because they want to make it about a left-right issue.
[00:43:00.987 --> 00:43:05.088]  And I said this during the campaign, and then White House memos came out six, seven months ago.
[00:43:05.088 --> 00:43:07.429]  It's in my film, The Obama Deception, where they say,
[00:43:08.368 --> 00:43:11.711]  We love it when Limbaugh attacks us because it makes it left-right.
[00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:13.412]  That energizes our base.
[00:43:13.412 --> 00:43:24.322]  Because the left in this country isn't going to support Obama's pro-war, pro-wiretapping, pro-torture rendition, all the bad things he's doing, unless he poses like a liberal.
[00:43:24.322 --> 00:43:28.906]  And so when he comes out and says we're going to prosecute the CIA for threatening people with drills,
[00:43:29.997 --> 00:43:31.978]  Withdrilling their ears.
[00:43:31.978 --> 00:43:34.799]  Then the left thinks, oh, Obama's good.
[00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:34.939]  See?
[00:43:34.939 --> 00:43:38.460]  So we're going to explain this, but why are they attacking me?
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.382]  Why are they mixing me in to that?
[00:43:42.382 --> 00:43:44.363]  Okay?
[00:43:44.363 --> 00:43:48.664]  We're going to break this down, and Glenn Beck is now telling the truth.
[00:43:48.664 --> 00:43:52.226]  He says he's afraid that Obama is going to stage an event.
[00:43:52.226 --> 00:43:55.887]  Michael Savage says he believes Obama's going to blow up a city.
[00:43:55.887 --> 00:43:57.948]  We'll be right back, and I blame it on somebody.
[00:44:00.435 --> 00:44:04.679]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:06.681]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:15.210]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:20.755]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:44:20.755 --> 00:44:22.397]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:44:22.617 --> 00:44:29.121]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:40.188]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:44:40.188 --> 00:44:40.948]  That's right.
[00:44:40.948 --> 00:44:43.530]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.071]  Order today by calling 1-800
[00:44:46.011 --> 00:44:46.852]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:44:46.852 --> 00:44:49.134]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:44:49.134 --> 00:44:50.155]  Well, you should.
[00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:54.619]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:55.139]  That's right.
[00:45:09.972 --> 00:45:19.978]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:45:19.978 --> 00:45:27.323]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:45:27.323 --> 00:45:34.227]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:45:34.227 --> 00:45:39.410]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:41.190]  This is real.
[00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.251]  Don't miss out.
[00:45:42.251 --> 00:45:50.813]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[00:45:50.813 --> 00:45:53.173]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:45:53.173 --> 00:45:56.874]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:45:56.874 --> 00:45:59.775]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:46:00.535 --> 00:46:05.741]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:46:05.741 --> 00:46:09.765]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:46:09.765 --> 00:46:15.692]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:20.757]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:46:20.757 --> 00:46:21.258]  Number three,
[00:46:21.658 --> 00:46:27.945]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:46:27.945 --> 00:46:30.849]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:35.374]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:46:35.374 --> 00:46:38.978]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:46:39.218 --> 00:46:44.943]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:46:44.943 --> 00:46:49.647]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:49.647 --> 00:46:51.429]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:51.429 --> 00:46:53.991]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:46:53.991 --> 00:46:56.633]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.953]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:47:03.953 --> 00:47:09.298]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:47:09.298 --> 00:47:11.340]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:16.345]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:47:16.345 --> 00:47:17.266]  How much do you want?
[00:47:17.506 --> 00:47:18.626]  When do you want it?
[00:47:18.626 --> 00:47:20.527]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:47:20.527 --> 00:47:21.588]  When will you need it?
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:23.788]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:47:23.788 --> 00:47:25.129]  Will there be any food?
[00:47:25.129 --> 00:47:26.670]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.932]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:35.053]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:47:35.513 --> 00:47:39.337]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:47:39.337 --> 00:47:40.558]  How much will you need?
[00:47:40.558 --> 00:47:41.459]  We don't know.
[00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:42.580]  How much do you want?
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.501]  All you can get.
[00:47:43.501 --> 00:47:44.602]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:44.602 --> 00:47:47.645]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:47:47.645 --> 00:47:49.847]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:47:49.847 --> 00:47:50.848]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:33.872]  Okay, so the George Soros, David Rockefeller-funded media matters who attacks me every week, but of this group of sites funded by these government-funded groups, I'm attacked almost every day now.
[00:48:33.872 --> 00:48:37.535]  And you can read the story up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com.
[00:48:37.535 --> 00:48:38.776]  We link through to it.
[00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:50.939]  And they say in here that we are lying and that we are insane, that we are dangerous, and that there is no plan for a civilian national security force.
[00:48:50.939 --> 00:48:53.740]  That's a quote from the article.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:59.082]  And that it's just complete lies.
[00:48:59.082 --> 00:49:03.403]  And they say Limbaugh is insane, I am insane, Glenn Beck is insane.
[00:49:07.489 --> 00:49:15.410]  And, you know, even if Limbaugh defends the Republican Party a lot of times when he shouldn't, whenever that group's in power, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:22.232]  Obama gave scores of speeches calling for a civilian work brigade and military force.
[00:49:22.232 --> 00:49:23.812]  We're going to play a clip of it in a minute.
[00:49:23.812 --> 00:49:25.552]  Rahm Emanuel wrote a book about it.
[00:49:25.552 --> 00:49:27.733]  They've introduced four different bills.
[00:49:27.733 --> 00:49:34.314]  One of them passed with language to set up the federal body to begin the preparations for compulsory service.
[00:49:35.154 --> 00:49:43.918]  We've read the sections about national service for anybody in high school, college, three months of military training every summer.
[00:49:43.918 --> 00:49:50.121]  I'm going to play these clips right now of the White House Chief of Staff on C-SPAN and Obama on C-SPAN.
[00:49:51.038 --> 00:49:59.621]  Now, they just say we're insane liars and then link to our articles where I'm, where InfoWars has it posted.
[00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:06.324]  I mean, that'd be like if I said the sun is in the sky right now over the central time zone.
[00:50:06.324 --> 00:50:11.626]  And you walk outside at 4.49 and 10 seconds and the sun is in the sky!
[00:50:11.626 --> 00:50:15.288]  And that'd be like Media Matters saying no, it's not true.
[00:50:17.096 --> 00:50:26.346]  And I've got all the videos of AmeriCorps and SecurCorps, the division of it, and the kids training with M-16s to quote, take on the militias.
[00:50:26.346 --> 00:50:28.007]  And it's in the New York Times.
[00:50:28.007 --> 00:50:33.934]  Oh, look at our new youth brigades training with Homeland Security to take on the right-wing terrorists.
[00:50:33.934 --> 00:50:36.857]  I mean, you can't make this up!
[00:50:36.857 --> 00:50:39.119]  It's true!
[00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:39.700]  It started
[00:50:42.026 --> 00:50:47.009]  Under Bush Sr., under Clinton, Bush Jr., and now it's exploding.
[00:50:47.009 --> 00:50:50.471]  They're really setting this up!
[00:50:50.471 --> 00:50:53.393]  I mean, in fact, we should queue up the trailer.
[00:50:53.393 --> 00:50:55.274]  It's up on the main page of Infowars.com.
[00:50:55.274 --> 00:51:09.023]  We should queue up the trailer, because it has a clip of it in there, of City Year, one of the group David Gergen runs, the Republican who, quote, handles the Democrats, Richard Nixon's minion, with him in black and red uniforms,
[00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:13.711]  Doing military drills and saying they're fierce.
[00:51:13.711 --> 00:51:16.913]  And going out and beating people up, the Obama supporters.
[00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:25.557]  In fact, I was on Daily Kos, and the very union that has their thugs beating up anybody that goes to town halls is the one advertising.
[00:51:25.557 --> 00:51:27.938]  I mean, these people are getting federal money.
[00:51:27.938 --> 00:51:30.419]  Acorn's getting $2 billion.
[00:51:30.419 --> 00:51:33.140]  This is Chicago mafia tactics.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.121]  And I, as a red-blooded American, am not putting up with it.
[00:51:36.121 --> 00:51:39.423]  But look, go read Media Matters story.
[00:51:40.455 --> 00:51:51.726]  Front page right now, Media Matters, saying none of these youth brigades exist, then link through to the very link they have on there, and it's not us saying it, it's the President and his Chief of Staff.
[00:51:51.726 --> 00:51:53.047]  Here is the President.
[00:51:53.047 --> 00:51:59.133]  Here is Barack Obama talking about a civilian force as big as the Pentagon.
[00:51:59.133 --> 00:51:59.514]  Here it is.
[00:52:00.765 --> 00:52:08.736]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:52:08.736 --> 00:52:15.787]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:20.478 --> 00:52:37.283]  Now, I have three mainstream news articles that I printed off PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars today, where they're announcing local tattletale squads to look for extremists, the TSAs on the streets of America now looking for spies, federal spies.
[00:52:37.283 --> 00:52:42.105]  Homeland Security said that seven years ago that they were going to expand out to the shopping malls and everywhere else.
[00:52:42.105 --> 00:52:43.265]  It's happening!
[00:52:43.265 --> 00:52:44.686]  It's bipartisan!
[00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:47.752]  Now, that is enough for you.
[00:52:47.752 --> 00:52:50.315]  We can play clip after clip of Obama saying it.
[00:52:50.315 --> 00:52:51.436]  That's one of the more famous ones.
[00:52:51.436 --> 00:52:55.699]  I've got a bunch of new ones in my upcoming film, Fall of the Republic, about Obama.
[00:52:55.699 --> 00:52:57.661]  Let's go to Rahm Emanuel.
[00:52:57.661 --> 00:53:01.044]  This is the Chief of Staff on C-SPAN saying it.
[00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:01.545]  Here he is.
[00:53:10.734 --> 00:53:12.857]  Alright, and the video's got some text at the front.
[00:53:12.857 --> 00:53:17.041]  What did Barack Obama mean when he said, we're going to have a national security force?
[00:53:17.041 --> 00:53:18.383]  This is Rahm Emanuel, C-SPAN.
[00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:20.610]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:25.914]  Congressman Rahm Emanuel has been picked by Barack Obama to be his White House Chief of Staff.
[00:53:25.914 --> 00:53:30.338]  And now you have a book with the ambitious title of The Plan.
[00:53:30.338 --> 00:53:32.780]  The word universal comes through a lot.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.301]  Universal will scare some people.
[00:53:34.301 --> 00:53:36.683]  They will think big government program.
[00:53:36.683 --> 00:53:39.525]  The idea of universal citizen service.
[00:53:39.525 --> 00:53:40.686]  You have to participate.
[00:53:40.686 --> 00:53:43.228]  Citizenship is not an entitlement program.
[00:53:43.228 --> 00:53:44.709]  It comes with responsibilities.
[00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:52.669]  Everybody somewhere between the ages of 18-25 will serve three months of basic training and understanding in a kind of civil defense.
[00:53:52.669 --> 00:54:03.859]  That universal sense of service, somewhere between the ages of 18-25, will give Americans, once again, a sense of what they are to be American and their contribution to a country and a common experience.
[00:54:03.859 --> 00:54:09.484]  And you look at World War II, that was a draft, but this is not a draft, it's a universal service.
[00:54:11.494 --> 00:54:20.778]  It is not an accident that we started our big march towards civil rights and expanding post-World War II because the country came through an experience together.
[00:54:20.778 --> 00:54:22.579]  So is this compulsory then?
[00:54:22.579 --> 00:54:26.361]  Well, you have to, in a sense, it's a requirement of everybody.
[00:54:26.361 --> 00:54:29.042]  18 to 25, three months.
[00:54:29.042 --> 00:54:33.104]  Because I think anytime somebody serves their country in some capacity, we're going to be stronger for it.
[00:54:37.352 --> 00:54:40.659]  And he goes on in his book saying he'll have to do jumping jacks and workouts.
[00:54:40.659 --> 00:54:47.734]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:54:51.678 --> 00:54:54.080]  Now, living in the U.S.S.R.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.841]  Back in the U.S.S.R.
[00:54:55.841 --> 00:54:58.202]  You don't know how lucky you are!
[00:54:58.202 --> 00:55:16.515]  This is the new civil rights, and in his book, and then in the four bills they've introduced, we barely got it stripped down, where it would automatically say all high school kids, including homeschool, have to serve, starting in junior high, from eighth grade to when they get out, and then two years of college, three months.
[00:55:16.515 --> 00:55:20.457]  And by the way, that clip we found on YouTube that Kurt linked to in the article, that's nothing.
[00:55:21.998 --> 00:55:29.605]  On YouTube and Google, there's the whole C-SPAN interview where he says, yes, you'll be in uniforms, you'll do jumping jacks, you'll get up at 6 a.m.
[00:55:29.605 --> 00:55:31.406]  I mean, this is you hurting.
[00:55:31.406 --> 00:55:33.968]  Compulsory required.
[00:55:33.968 --> 00:55:38.892]  Now, here's Media Matters.
[00:55:38.892 --> 00:55:43.236]  Media Matters says that none of this exists.
[00:55:44.488 --> 00:55:53.834]  In fact, Hartman, what I want you to do is I want you to go to the InfoWars article, Media Matters hit piece, and you can just link through to the Oliver Williams story, and then that'll be the current one.
[00:55:53.834 --> 00:56:01.578]  I want people to actually see, because we're also simulcasting right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, if you're a radio listener and you keep hearing me say, I want people to see this.
[00:56:01.578 --> 00:56:12.625]  That's what's so great about this being in a TV station format, radio slash TV, is I can show people this who are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, and then it's ripped to the four winds on the internet.
[00:56:13.405 --> 00:56:24.375]  While it's still open and free for a few years, maybe, maybe more, before the government launches a false flag on the internet and shuts it down in the name of saving it.
[00:56:24.375 --> 00:56:24.575]  But...
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:42.394]  Yeah, Glenn Beck mainstreams fringe conspiracy theories, and then it goes on to say Glenn Beck copies me, which is the only truthful thing in this whole article, and talks about the delusions that I've been warning about for years of forced national conscription and paramilitary teams.
[00:56:42.394 --> 00:56:46.157]  All I'm doing is reading the bills!
[00:56:46.157 --> 00:56:48.979]  In fact, I didn't even print this for the show today.
[00:56:48.979 --> 00:56:53.183]  Google this next, Hartman, for people out there listening, do it yourselves.
[00:56:53.183 --> 00:56:53.824]  New bill
[00:56:57.366 --> 00:57:02.130]  They passed a bill two months ago that says that they're setting up the federal agency to set up the compulsory service.
[00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:19.012]  But they've got other bills in there that state it will be compulsory service.
[00:57:19.012 --> 00:57:21.815]  And you just heard the White House Chief of Staff, you just heard Obama.
[00:57:21.815 --> 00:57:31.203]  Now, again, they think you're stupid when Media Matters puts up articles... I mean, it's Media Matters that says Rush Limbaugh's a liar.
[00:57:31.203 --> 00:57:35.987]  And I gotta tell you, I read Media Matters every week to see what they're up to over the last decade.
[00:57:35.987 --> 00:57:40.610]  Ninety-plus percent of the time they're lying about Rush Limbaugh, and Rush Limbaugh's telling the truth.
[00:57:41.482 --> 00:57:43.644]  Let me tell you what Rush Limbaugh lies about.
[00:57:43.644 --> 00:57:47.147]  He lies about the Republican Party being good.
[00:57:47.147 --> 00:57:49.790]  He lies about them not tripling the size of government.
[00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:53.193]  He lies about how they're going to save us, and how the war on terror is real.
[00:57:54.909 --> 00:57:58.732]  But he tells the truth about big government and gun grabbing and open borders.
[00:57:58.732 --> 00:58:00.453]  And that's why they don't like him.
[00:58:00.453 --> 00:58:05.336]  Because, compared to George Soros and David Rockefeller, Rush Limbaugh is a great guy.
[00:58:05.336 --> 00:58:07.517]  That's why they don't like him.
[00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:11.060]  Because he's not totally sold out to the New World Order.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.901]  He doesn't fit into their program.
[00:58:12.901 --> 00:58:15.082]  We're gonna come back after the news.
[00:58:15.082 --> 00:58:17.664]  I'm gonna finish up with this and then start taking your phone calls.
[00:58:17.664 --> 00:58:18.985]  Our phone system's down for some reason.
[00:58:19.773 --> 00:58:20.213]  That's fine.
[00:58:20.213 --> 00:58:21.254]  I can talk for 10 hours.
[00:58:21.254 --> 00:58:22.455]  You know that, folks.
[00:58:22.455 --> 00:58:23.215]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:23.215 --> 00:58:24.076]  Stay with us.
[00:58:24.076 --> 00:58:25.457]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:25.457 --> 00:58:27.398]  We're live-streaming TV right now.
[00:58:27.398 --> 00:58:32.442]  We're going to let you hear what Limbaugh has to say about this with Glenn Beck on the other side.
[00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.183]  Sounds like the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:34.183 --> 00:58:38.706]  And Michael Savage says Obama's going to stage terror attacks, and I agree with him.
[00:58:38.706 --> 00:58:41.448]  That's the only way this criminal's going to get what he wants.
[00:58:41.448 --> 00:58:42.228]  Stay with us!
[00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:43.769]  The truth is coming out!
[00:58:43.769 --> 00:58:45.490]  The people are waking up!
[00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:47.432]  We're ending the left-right paradigm!
[00:58:50.472 --> 00:58:54.696]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.696 --> 00:58:56.717]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.717 --> 00:59:05.225]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.225 --> 00:59:10.789]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:12.411]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.631 --> 00:59:19.155]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:30.203]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.203 --> 00:59:30.983]  That's right.
[00:59:30.983 --> 00:59:33.545]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.545 --> 00:59:35.346]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:57.901]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:01:05.376 --> 01:01:10.199]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.779]  You want answers?
[01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:12.740]  Well, so does he.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:17.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:17.523 --> 01:01:21.565]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:24.908 --> 01:01:40.214]  You know, there's a reason I have continually told my people, since we're doing my show out in the studio, Genesis has T1 phone lines that go over a computer, down a couple times every month.
[01:01:40.214 --> 01:01:41.775]  We have that system.
[01:01:41.775 --> 01:01:44.756]  We need regular phone lines as a backup.
[01:01:44.756 --> 01:01:46.537]  And people look at me like I've got, you know,
[01:01:47.977 --> 01:01:51.719]  Like I'm a 14-headed green space alien around here.
[01:01:51.719 --> 01:01:55.140]  So no phone calls today here on the show.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.721]  But Pirmus is coming up.
[01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:58.222]  They should have it fixed by then.
[01:01:58.222 --> 01:02:00.463]  The phone company is having to do something.
[01:02:00.463 --> 01:02:02.384]  So whatever.
[01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:03.764]  Frankly, I could talk 100 hours.
[01:02:03.764 --> 01:02:05.145]  I'm actually happy in a sick way.
[01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.668]  Though I do like to hear from the listeners in the different directions they take us in.
[01:02:08.668 --> 01:02:11.771]  I got a bunch of flu news coming up, very important.
[01:02:11.771 --> 01:02:16.816]  It's not enough to have level 6 with the flu, now they're going above that to increase the fear-mongering.
[01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:20.419]  Bunch of new important pieces of information there.
[01:02:20.419 --> 01:02:27.286]  Scientists tell Swedish TV, World Health Organization, pandemic criteria lowered to benefit Big Pharma.
[01:02:29.901 --> 01:02:33.383]  See, that's why they're announcing a global pandemic when it's not really a pandemic.
[01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.504]  It's so they can take your liberties away.
[01:02:35.504 --> 01:02:37.105]  It's not just about making money.
[01:02:37.105 --> 01:02:39.467]  They like making money while they dominate you.
[01:02:39.467 --> 01:02:41.328]  It's all about the power.
[01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:43.389]  Because you got the power, you got the money.
[01:02:43.389 --> 01:02:44.770]  And you got the money, you get the woman.
[01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:47.130]  Tony Montana says.
[01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.172]  Also, flu shot or get fired.
[01:02:49.172 --> 01:02:51.433]  That's coming out all over the world.
[01:02:51.433 --> 01:02:53.555]  Times Union reports on this.
[01:02:53.555 --> 01:02:59.939]  Texas Adult Protective Services kidnapping elderly couples and then of course sucking their bank accounts dry.
[01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:01.100]  It's all part of the government op.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:05.223]  Because you gotta give the tens of trillions to the foreign offshore banks.
[01:03:05.223 --> 01:03:08.385]  I mean, that's essential to do.
[01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.847]  It's essential to get that job done.
[01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:21.691]  And we're also going to get into this whole act where Obama says, I'm going to release the torture photos and a month later says he's not going to.
[01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:25.912]  I'm going to prosecute these guys that were threatening to use electric drills on people.
[01:03:25.912 --> 01:03:28.032]  That's a diversion from all the real torture.
[01:03:28.032 --> 01:03:29.973]  We're going to go over that.
[01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.493]  Bunch of economic news.
[01:03:32.493 --> 01:03:37.954]  But this is a big deal with media matters going after us.
[01:03:37.954 --> 01:03:41.995]  This is a big deal with mainstream media.
[01:03:45.293 --> 01:03:47.594]  Attacking us and these big foundations.
[01:03:47.594 --> 01:03:49.795]  I mean, these foundations are the New World Order.
[01:03:49.795 --> 01:03:52.757]  This is how they buy off politicians, put out their propaganda.
[01:03:52.757 --> 01:04:02.282]  It is the foundations, the Rockefeller Foundations and others, that openly own and run NPR and actually make profits for themselves off of it.
[01:04:02.282 --> 01:04:06.484]  A lot of the PBS stations, almost the entire radio network.
[01:04:06.484 --> 01:04:09.446]  And so they're going to have a tax now on talk radio that goes to them.
[01:04:10.816 --> 01:04:14.506]  This is how the sick game works.
[01:04:14.506 --> 01:04:16.671]  This is how they operate.
[01:04:16.671 --> 01:04:19.298]  This is how they get their job done.
[01:04:20.894 --> 01:04:37.443]  And we'll be talking more about this tomorrow because they're coming out in the open saying they want to censor talk radio, censor the internet, federally take over the internet, and then every time we say, hey, we don't want National Compulsory Service or for you to take the internet over, they go, what are you talking about, conspiracy theorist?
[01:04:37.443 --> 01:04:39.885]  And we're like, well, here's your bill.
[01:04:39.885 --> 01:04:42.106]  They go, you're a crazy man.
[01:04:42.106 --> 01:04:43.307]  There's no Congress.
[01:04:43.307 --> 01:04:44.147]  There's no bill.
[01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:46.208]  I mean, I expect them to say that next.
[01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:47.589]  Like, you don't exist.
[01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:48.690]  You're going crazy.
[01:04:49.878 --> 01:04:53.862]  I mean, you know, they play these mind games with us.
[01:04:53.862 --> 01:04:58.205]  And I, for one, have had enough of these mind games, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:58.205 --> 01:05:09.115]  So we're going to come back and play this clip of Limbaugh and Beck, and then try to analyze why is the media attacking them, and the big foundations attacking them, but then mixing me in.
[01:05:09.115 --> 01:05:11.858]  I mean, I'm not as big as Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh.
[01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:18.495]  Virally on the internet, I'm actually bigger than Limbaugh and Beck overseas.
[01:05:18.495 --> 01:05:21.298]  You can look at that on the Alexa ratings and different web ratings.
[01:05:21.298 --> 01:05:29.387]  But my growth curve is to eclipse them within two or three years if I continue to grow like this.
[01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:33.371]  But still, Beck's probably double the audience I have.
[01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:34.893]  Limbaugh's probably more than double.
[01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.307]  My audience is different, though.
[01:05:38.307 --> 01:05:42.249]  It's not a bunch of, you know, Glenn Beck is a meddling limbaugh.
[01:05:42.249 --> 01:05:45.071]  A lot of geriatric folks, which are great people.
[01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:49.353]  But, you know, on average their listeners and viewers are about 75 to 80.
[01:05:49.353 --> 01:05:52.515]  I have the young people, and that scares the controlled left.
[01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:55.056]  So we'll explain all that, too, when we get back.
[01:05:55.056 --> 01:05:55.857]  Stay with us!
[01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:04.992]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:04.992 --> 01:06:09.014]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.014 --> 01:06:14.916]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:19.979]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.979 --> 01:06:20.439]  Number three,
[01:06:20.899 --> 01:06:27.202]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:06:27.202 --> 01:06:30.083]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:34.625]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:38.227]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:06:38.467 --> 01:06:44.194]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:06:44.194 --> 01:06:48.899]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:48.899 --> 01:06:50.681]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.681 --> 01:06:53.244]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:07:01.815 --> 01:07:08.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:08.439 --> 01:07:14.563]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.304]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:16.304 --> 01:07:16.844]  to 3 p.m.
[01:07:16.844 --> 01:07:21.447]  Central Standard Time, ladies and gentlemen, I am live.
[01:07:21.447 --> 01:07:22.687]  When we come back Sunday, it's 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:07:26.983 --> 01:07:28.384]  Alright, let me continue here.
[01:07:28.384 --> 01:07:35.967]  So you got Rush Limbaugh, 22 million listeners, conservatively, millions more on the internet, but rated 22 million.
[01:07:35.967 --> 01:07:43.551]  Glenn Beck, 10 million on the radio, 5 million every week or so tune in.
[01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:50.974]  Why am I being lumped in with them constantly when both Limbaugh and Beck have attacked me repeatedly on radio?
[01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:59.855]  I don't think Beck's ever talked about me specifically, but he's talked about groups I founded constantly on TV and called for our arrest.
[01:07:59.855 --> 01:08:09.657]  And I told you six months before he went, he said, I'm going to expose in a few months, uh, it was about six months ago, but it was about two or three months before he did it.
[01:08:09.657 --> 01:08:11.357]  He said, I think FEMA camps are real.
[01:08:11.357 --> 01:08:12.577]  I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
[01:08:12.577 --> 01:08:15.158]  And I said, he will go show the Indiana train station.
[01:08:16.567 --> 01:08:30.957]  That's an Amtrak station is clearly not a FEMA camp, but he won't cover the civilian inmate labor camp program, or the bills to expand the camps, or all the admissions, or Rex 84, or the Miami Herald, or the Houston Chronicle, or the New York Times, or Open... No, no.
[01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:32.758]  He's gonna go to a straw man and discredit.
[01:08:32.758 --> 01:08:35.080]  They said, oh Alex, leave Beck alone.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.041]  He's a good guy.
[01:08:36.974 --> 01:08:38.454]  You know, he talks about the New World Order.
[01:08:38.454 --> 01:08:41.715]  Yeah, but he acts like it's something the Democrats are doing.
[01:08:41.715 --> 01:08:49.837]  And as long as you only make it about the Democrats, then it could still be a left-right issue and they control people by keeping them on the right-wing fake reservation.
[01:08:49.837 --> 01:08:58.720]  Instead of just waking up and saying, I'm somebody who wants freedom, both parties are controlled, abolish the Federal Reserve, arrest the bankers that have run this scam.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.780]  Okay?
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.401]  So why is Media Matters
[01:09:03.857 --> 01:09:25.729]  And why is George Soros and Daily Kos and Alternet and all these Rockefeller acorn-founded foundations, and they openly are founded by that, why are they out saying that there's no such thing as National Compulsory Service when I can read from the bills, the White House's own publications, Obama clips and Rahm Emanuel clips, I could play them for hours, there's so many, and we just played two of them last hour.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.962]  There it is, House Passes Mandatory National Service Bill.
[01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:36.887]  You can scroll down on that article and it's got all the links right there.
[01:09:36.887 --> 01:09:44.454]  Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, known as the GIVE Act, was passed 321 to 105 margin.
[01:09:44.454 --> 01:09:48.757]  Sets up a federal body to prepare National Compulsory Service.
[01:09:48.757 --> 01:09:55.063]  It had the compulsory service in it, we got it stripped, so they said we'll set up an agency with the power to do it.
[01:09:55.785 --> 01:09:57.206]  I mean, there's the bill!
[01:09:57.206 --> 01:09:59.627]  Got a link to it right there!
[01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:08.352]  But they're saying, I'm insane, I'm dangerous, it doesn't exist, Beck is dangerous, doesn't exist.
[01:10:08.352 --> 01:10:17.758]  When you read the comments on the Media Matters article, and it's like, arrest them, they're all criminals, arrest Limbaugh, arrest Alex, you know, arrest Beck.
[01:10:22.119 --> 01:10:23.640]  In fact, cue up Michael Savage.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.420]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.981]  So if you YouTube it, a bunch will come up.
[01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:30.403]  But Savage says Obama to stage terror.
[01:10:30.403 --> 01:10:33.265]  I mean, let's play Savage with 8 million listeners saying it.
[01:10:33.265 --> 01:10:41.969]  This is scaring the system because there is some industry, some money, some... It's not totally controlled in the U.S.
[01:10:41.969 --> 01:10:50.053]  And there is a kind of Republican instinct to not totally have open government control and total police state.
[01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:56.854]  And so because Republicans are out of power, it's kind of time for them to play that part, the populist role.
[01:10:56.854 --> 01:10:58.115]  We do it no matter who's in office.
[01:10:58.115 --> 01:11:00.497]  We're nonpartisan.
[01:11:00.497 --> 01:11:02.298]  We're constitutionalist here.
[01:11:02.298 --> 01:11:07.843]  But they're mixing me in with Limbaugh and Beck because they're scared of all of us across the board.
[01:11:10.942 --> 01:11:16.928]  And they're particularly scared of me because I have the young demographic as well as the middle-aged and the old.
[01:11:16.928 --> 01:11:17.889]  I'm very diverse.
[01:11:17.889 --> 01:11:20.672]  I've got the left and the right waking up.
[01:11:20.672 --> 01:11:31.663]  And so while they're busy demonizing Limbaugh and Beck, who've got a lot more skeletons in their closet and problems, they can kind of mix me in and go after what they see as the real threat to their system.
[01:11:33.134 --> 01:11:44.282]  Because when they've got a fake right-wing savior in power who's gonna keep all the bad stuff Obama does, just like Obama's keeping all the bad stuff Bush put in place, I'll be fighting it when Limbaugh and Beck are defending it.
[01:11:44.282 --> 01:11:48.184]  Just like Keith Olbermann would go after Bush for wanting to stage terror attacks on U.S.
[01:11:48.184 --> 01:11:52.567]  ships, but as soon as Obama comes in he won't talk about it?
[01:11:52.567 --> 01:11:57.891]  See, I'm not a political pundit with a
[01:12:00.413 --> 01:12:02.594]  Dog in the fight when it comes to which party.
[01:12:02.594 --> 01:12:04.854]  I want my children to grow up in a free society.
[01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:09.195]  But anyways, it's creepy to have this type of powerful institutions attacking me.
[01:12:09.195 --> 01:12:12.156]  The biggest, most powerful New World Order foundations.
[01:12:12.156 --> 01:12:14.137]  Now, let's play Limbaugh and Beck.
[01:12:14.137 --> 01:12:16.277]  Beck, this is an amazing 10-minute clip.
[01:12:16.277 --> 01:12:18.178]  It's up on Infowars.com, unedited.
[01:12:18.178 --> 01:12:22.019]  We have a link to the YouTube if you want to find it, but this is
[01:12:23.559 --> 01:12:32.303]  Limbaugh and Beck openly saying that Obama may stage something to go after people and that, oh, Rush, he blamed you for McVeigh.
[01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:33.704]  No, Clinton blamed you for that.
[01:12:33.704 --> 01:12:39.727]  I mean, this is a big deal to have Limbaugh and Beck going this far.
[01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:41.428]  This is amazing.
[01:12:41.428 --> 01:12:46.170]  And they can tell folks that they're now in danger of being shut down.
[01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:47.011]  Let's go ahead and go to it.
[01:12:47.011 --> 01:12:47.311]  Here it is.
[01:12:49.428 --> 01:12:56.215]  Tomorrow, on this program, I'm going to lay out the case of the army that they are building right underneath our nose.
[01:12:56.215 --> 01:13:00.340]  An army that he spoke about on the campaign trail.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:07.067]  If you watch what can only be called the administration's organ,
[01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:12.630]  Anything involved with GE or NBC.
[01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:16.991]  You've got now Jeffrey Immelt on the board of the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:16.991 --> 01:13:22.113]  You have him in the Oval Office consulting not only on health care, but the financial situation.
[01:13:22.113 --> 01:13:23.753]  And they are in Oregon.
[01:13:23.753 --> 01:13:28.715]  If you watch MSNBC, I contend that you will see the future.
[01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:35.937]  Because they are laying the ground for a horrible event that will be, is what they're laying the ground for,
[01:13:36.457 --> 01:13:53.092]  Anything from the right, there's some awful event, and I fear this government, this administration, has so much framework already prepared that they will seize power overnight before anybody even gives it a second thought.
[01:13:53.092 --> 01:14:01.600]  Well, I think because of what you're doing with your television show, your radio show, what we're all doing here, I don't think they're going to be able to seize it overnight without anybody knowing about it.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:02.941]  Stop it right there!
[01:14:30.376 --> 01:14:33.020]  Again, everything Limbaugh's saying is totally true.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.928]  And that's the thing, compared to media matters, this guy is the bastion of truth and wisdom.
[01:14:39.619 --> 01:14:43.361]  I mean, he distorts stuff, he twists, but I listen to Limbaugh off and on.
[01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:51.084]  It's nothing compared to Media Matters and George Soros saying there's no plan for national compulsory service.
[01:14:51.084 --> 01:14:55.706]  I just gave you bill numbers, the White House Chief of Staff and the President calling for it.
[01:14:55.706 --> 01:15:02.929]  And Media Matters knows that the big foundations want compulsory service, or slavery, and they call it the new civil rights.
[01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:25.412]  And it's come out in Texas and all over, fake people posing as doctors on the White House payroll, not just with a foundation, and all over the country they got fake people, and Acorn and others have been advertising $500 to go to these events and to pose as a supporter.
[01:15:25.412 --> 01:15:27.093]  I mean, it's on record!
[01:15:27.093 --> 01:15:29.535]  They're the ones paying for the crowds!
[01:15:30.546 --> 01:15:33.647]  People know the government can't administer health care.
[01:15:33.647 --> 01:15:37.928]  Health care's screwed up because government got their fat hands involved in it!
[01:15:37.928 --> 01:15:40.249]  And they go, be compassionate, take care of people.
[01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:41.669]  It's a bunch of eugenicists.
[01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:45.211]  Tom Daschle wrote a book saying don't give old people health care.
[01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:46.851]  In Europe, they do ration it.
[01:15:46.851 --> 01:15:48.231]  They are eugenicists.
[01:15:48.231 --> 01:15:49.532]  They do want you to die.
[01:15:49.532 --> 01:15:52.953]  The bioethics boards are death panels, you lying trash!
[01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.232]  I'm sick of your crap!
[01:15:56.232 --> 01:15:56.892]  I am, man!
[01:15:56.892 --> 01:15:58.194]  I'm sick of it!
[01:15:58.194 --> 01:15:59.997]  Go back to Pillhead!
[01:15:59.997 --> 01:16:00.818]  He's telling the truth!
[01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:04.147]  I don't know.
[01:16:31.221 --> 01:16:35.183]  You know, we may be looking at Barack Obama destroying the Democrat Party.
[01:16:35.183 --> 01:16:38.605]  It's too soon to say that now, but we may be looking at that happen.
[01:16:38.605 --> 01:16:41.226]  There are reasons for optimism.
[01:16:41.226 --> 01:16:43.808]  They talk about staged terror attacks, everything else.
[01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:46.689]  We're forcing the mainstream to talk about these issues.
[01:16:46.689 --> 01:16:48.530]  There's obviously a fissure within the elite.
[01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:51.092]  That's why they're letting Limbaugh and Beck do this.
[01:16:51.092 --> 01:16:56.595]  Because there's a lot of people in the power structure going, are we going to really be like Nazi Germany meets Mao Zedong?
[01:16:56.595 --> 01:16:58.536]  I mean, are we really going to let this happen?
[01:17:00.606 --> 01:17:01.986]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:17:01.986 --> 01:17:03.987]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:04.967]  Well, you should.
[01:17:04.967 --> 01:17:09.449]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:10.269]  That's right.
[01:17:10.269 --> 01:17:20.273]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:17:20.273 --> 01:17:21.433]  Plus, if you act fast,
[01:17:21.633 --> 01:17:27.616]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:17:27.616 --> 01:17:34.499]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:17:34.499 --> 01:17:40.021]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:17:40.021 --> 01:17:41.502]  This is real.
[01:17:41.502 --> 01:17:42.542]  Don't miss out.
[01:17:42.542 --> 01:17:49.405]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:17:49.825 --> 01:18:04.388]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:09.709]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:11.769]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:18:11.769 --> 01:18:16.750]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.690]  How much do you want?
[01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:19.071]  When do you want it?
[01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:20.952]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:18:20.952 --> 01:18:22.013]  When will you need it?
[01:18:22.013 --> 01:18:24.215]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:25.556]  Will there be any food?
[01:18:25.556 --> 01:18:27.097]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:18:27.097 --> 01:18:32.361]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:35.944]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:39.427]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:18:39.767 --> 01:18:40.988]  How much will you need?
[01:18:40.988 --> 01:18:41.889]  We don't know.
[01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:42.990]  How much do you want?
[01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:43.931]  All you can get.
[01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:45.012]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:48.075]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:18:48.075 --> 01:18:49.857]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:18:49.857 --> 01:18:50.757]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:19:00.413 --> 01:19:05.720]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.803]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:19:07.803 --> 01:19:10.246]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:12.529]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:19:12.529 --> 01:19:14.151]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:19:14.151 --> 01:19:15.173]  There is a solution.
[01:19:15.413 --> 01:19:23.838]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:20:00.333 --> 01:20:04.577]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:20:04.577 --> 01:20:06.579]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:20:06.579 --> 01:20:15.108]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:20:15.108 --> 01:20:20.653]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:20:20.653 --> 01:20:22.275]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:20:22.515 --> 01:20:29.021]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:20:29.021 --> 01:20:40.091]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:20:40.091 --> 01:20:40.852]  That's right.
[01:20:40.852 --> 01:20:43.414]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:20:43.414 --> 01:20:45.015]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:20:47.237 --> 01:20:47.577]  6043.
[01:20:47.577 --> 01:20:50.738]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:20:50.738 --> 01:20:58.101]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:20:58.101 --> 01:21:08.165]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[01:21:08.165 --> 01:21:11.926]  No one's gonna take me
[01:21:14.427 --> 01:21:15.588]  Alright, good news!
[01:21:15.588 --> 01:21:18.170]  They got the ridiculous phone system back up and working.
[01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:19.391]  Happens a couple times a year.
[01:21:19.391 --> 01:21:23.173]  This office looks like the Jawa Landcrawler on the inside of it.
[01:21:23.173 --> 01:21:24.374]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:21:24.374 --> 01:21:27.457]  We're locally in Central Texas.
[01:21:27.457 --> 01:21:29.158]  We're listening on, say, 590 AM.
[01:21:29.158 --> 01:21:29.358]  ALBJ.
[01:21:39.121 --> 01:21:43.424]  To say it properly, News Radio 590, KLBJ, 512-646-1776.
[01:21:43.424 --> 01:21:52.912]  If the word 1776 offends you, I'm sorry, but George Soros has brainwashed you.
[01:21:52.912 --> 01:22:02.019]  So, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck talking about staged terror attacks, do you, and then we're going to your phone calls, do you have the clip of Savage?
[01:22:02.019 --> 01:22:03.360]  Were you able to pull that up quickly?
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.522]  I know I've got one guy in here today doing the job of three people.
[01:22:06.633 --> 01:22:07.514]  We'll pull it up later.
[01:22:07.514 --> 01:22:07.974]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:07.974 --> 01:22:15.842]  I mean, the point is, is that the things I've talked about for 14 years, being laughed at, are now mainstream news.
[01:22:15.842 --> 01:22:17.504]  And the establishment doesn't like that.
[01:22:17.504 --> 01:22:26.452]  Some of the other news, while we're queuing that up, I want to hear from listeners about, I mean, what does this mean for this show?
[01:22:26.452 --> 01:22:27.854]  It's got me looking over my back.
[01:22:28.854 --> 01:22:33.818]  To have Media Matters attacking me and all these George Soros, Rockefeller government fronts.
[01:22:33.818 --> 01:22:46.128]  I mean, they admit these are run by the Security Council, by the State Department, by spooks, by the government.
[01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:53.852]  And the government launders money through these foundations and through ACORN, and then they launder it back out in the media.
[01:22:53.852 --> 01:22:59.533]  Now they're going to have a tax of all internet, AM and FM, radio.
[01:22:59.533 --> 01:23:01.794]  They're now saying FCC's going to be over the web.
[01:23:01.794 --> 01:23:08.136]  I mean, the FCC can go jump off a cliff if they start trying to regulate free speech on the web.
[01:23:08.136 --> 01:23:09.776]  I mean, I'm just sick of it!
[01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:10.857]  I'm sick of it!
[01:23:10.857 --> 01:23:12.957]  Get off my back, parasites!
[01:23:12.957 --> 01:23:14.398]  I can't take anymore!
[01:23:14.398 --> 01:23:15.758]  And the people can't take anymore!
[01:23:19.107 --> 01:23:20.087]  Then I've got all this other news.
[01:23:20.087 --> 01:23:24.430]  Hospitals gear up for flu epidemic and they're saying it's above a level 6.
[01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:25.710]  A level 6 was the highest.
[01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:28.111]  It's like the color-coded red's the highest.
[01:23:28.111 --> 01:23:30.192]  Are they gonna go to purple level?
[01:23:30.192 --> 01:23:31.473]  They've done that.
[01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:38.616]  Scientists tell Swedish TV, World Health Organization, pandemic criteria lowered to benefit Big Pharma.
[01:23:38.616 --> 01:23:42.058]  Flu shot or get fired, that's being announced all over the country and the world.
[01:23:43.598 --> 01:23:52.125]  So we're going to go over all of those reports after I take some phone calls, but here's Michael Savage saying Obama's going to stage a terror attack, and I agree with him.
[01:23:52.125 --> 01:24:01.313]  If Obama doesn't stage a terror attack like Bush did, that is the people handling Bush and Obama, it's way above them, then it's over.
[01:24:01.313 --> 01:24:04.796]  In fact, I haven't checked in a week, what's the Rasmussen Daily Tracker?
[01:24:04.796 --> 01:24:05.877]  It was 41 last Sunday.
[01:24:07.768 --> 01:24:09.769]  And he was losing on average a point and a half a week.
[01:24:09.769 --> 01:24:11.249]  Was it 39?
[01:24:11.249 --> 01:24:12.630]  Is that possible?
[01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:17.572]  Lowest ever for any president eight months in?
[01:24:17.572 --> 01:24:19.352]  Let's go ahead and play the savage clip.
[01:24:19.352 --> 01:24:21.353]  Here it is.
[01:24:21.353 --> 01:24:23.094]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[01:24:23.094 --> 01:24:30.816]  I predict that very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:35.358]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are,
[01:24:36.141 --> 01:24:49.245]  Ram Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[01:24:49.245 --> 01:24:52.366]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[01:24:52.366 --> 01:24:52.987]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:55.407]  I put nothing... You can go listen to hours of it if you want.
[01:24:55.407 --> 01:24:56.528]  The issue here is...
[01:24:57.910 --> 01:25:02.155]  Is that everybody's getting it and now army manuals were declassified?
[01:25:02.155 --> 01:25:09.903]  We've listed the army number here before you can just search engine or startpage.com is a good search engine.
[01:25:09.903 --> 01:25:12.646]  You can just startpage.com the term or Google the term.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.581]  Army-filled manual false flag.
[01:25:15.581 --> 01:25:20.442]  And it tells the Army, blow up a school bus, shoot some people, blame it on your enemies, works well.
[01:25:20.442 --> 01:25:22.863]  They're like, ah, little kids, I'm favorite.
[01:25:22.863 --> 01:25:25.604]  You know, that's how you roll.
[01:25:25.604 --> 01:25:34.308]  You splatter some kids up against a wall, hand grenade a school bus, and you... And the Army's argument is, well, that helps us win the war, and then that saves lives.
[01:25:34.308 --> 01:25:36.849]  It's called collateral damage.
[01:25:36.849 --> 01:25:41.150]  See, generals for 5,000 years of recorded history have sent in...
[01:25:46.186 --> 01:25:46.907]  Excuse me.
[01:25:46.907 --> 01:25:56.174]  Generals for thousands of years have sent in what they call sacrificial forces or pawns.
[01:25:56.174 --> 01:25:59.077]  Pawn sacrifice.
[01:25:59.077 --> 01:26:01.899]  And they stage terror attacks.
[01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:02.820]  That's the modern version.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:12.308]  But before you would send in, say with the cavalry, you'd send in a unit of a hundred guys into Apache infested territory, knowing the Apaches are going to wipe them out.
[01:26:14.139 --> 01:26:16.061]  And the officer leading them in knows that.
[01:26:16.061 --> 01:26:18.202]  Try to hold out behind some rocks.
[01:26:18.202 --> 01:26:21.485]  You're probably all going to get killed, but we're all macho here.
[01:26:21.485 --> 01:26:23.386]  Yes sir, I'm ready to die.
[01:26:23.386 --> 01:26:25.468]  And once you, I mean, look at the Alamo.
[01:26:25.468 --> 01:26:28.610]  They sent them down there saying you're probably going to get wiped out.
[01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:32.613]  And then Travis said we're probably all going to get killed, but this will help us get the state.
[01:26:32.613 --> 01:26:34.695]  They're like, hell yeah, that sounds like a good way to die.
[01:26:34.695 --> 01:26:38.518]  I mean, these are, you know, so, so once you have that attitude, it's over.
[01:26:39.218 --> 01:26:43.421]  We're going to do it for America, blow up those towers and get tough, yeah.
[01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:46.683]  The Muslim extremists, we've got to do it to get the American people to pay attention.
[01:26:49.113 --> 01:26:49.933]  Oh, you don't like hearing that?
[01:26:49.933 --> 01:26:52.114]  It doesn't fit into your left-right paradigm.
[01:26:52.114 --> 01:26:54.755]  It's the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:54.755 --> 01:26:58.436]  Just like Northwood's called for hijacking jets and bombing D.C.
[01:26:58.436 --> 01:27:01.177]  and crashing jets to blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:27:01.177 --> 01:27:02.958]  Just like Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:27:02.958 --> 01:27:04.058]  Just like U.S.'
[01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.299]  's Liberty was staged.
[01:27:05.299 --> 01:27:07.419]  Just like Operation Ajax was staged.
[01:27:07.419 --> 01:27:10.860]  It's admitted that governments do this.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:17.883]  And they do not like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Michael Savage coming out and saying Obama's going to stage this stuff.
[01:27:18.223 --> 01:27:26.430]  Because, see, what happened is, back when I was exposing all of this, when it was Bush as the puppet, these guys hated me and attacked me.
[01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:33.456]  But now that Obama's in there, they are so partisan that they are actually telling the truth.
[01:27:33.456 --> 01:27:35.538]  And I think it's a beautiful thing.
[01:27:35.538 --> 01:27:43.565]  And I think it says that the kind of phony right-wing edifice has more credibility and more guts in it than the fake foundation left does.
[01:27:44.437 --> 01:27:50.380]  Because you would never hear the left, the mainline left, agreeing that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:56.103]  In fact, that pig creature Ed Schultz and the rest of them would get up there and attack me every week.
[01:27:56.103 --> 01:28:00.265]  And they would call to have Mike Malloy fired off of Air America, which they did.
[01:28:00.265 --> 01:28:05.667]  Because Mike Malloy was the only host on there that would tell the truth, so I respect him.
[01:28:05.667 --> 01:28:07.268]  I'll tell you something too, Daniel Ellsberg,
[01:28:08.837 --> 01:28:12.904]  I can tell you, I wouldn't believe who I got this from.
[01:28:12.904 --> 01:28:16.409]  Says he hates Obama because he's a total fraud, a corporate shill.
[01:28:16.409 --> 01:28:20.796]  See, I can respect somebody even if I disagree with them.
[01:28:22.156 --> 01:28:24.217]  Like a Congressman Kucinich.
[01:28:24.217 --> 01:28:25.558]  I don't agree with a lot of things he's for.
[01:28:25.558 --> 01:28:26.539]  I agree with some of it.
[01:28:26.539 --> 01:28:32.503]  But I like him because he's for real and believes he's helping the people and will tell you what he really thinks.
[01:28:32.503 --> 01:28:35.204]  And I've got to tell you, I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:28:35.204 --> 01:28:36.645]  Why is Limbaugh telling the truth?
[01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:38.266]  Why is Glenn Beck telling the truth?
[01:28:38.266 --> 01:28:42.929]  Why is... I don't think Savage is an operative.
[01:28:42.929 --> 01:28:45.571]  Limbaugh, I just think, is a creature of the system.
[01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:48.233]  Beck, I know is an operative.
[01:28:48.233 --> 01:28:49.754]  I mean, I predicted what he's going to do before.
[01:28:55.879 --> 01:29:02.264]  So it is just off the charts here, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening.
[01:29:02.264 --> 01:29:04.726]  And it is real.
[01:29:04.726 --> 01:29:07.828]  So we're going to go to break, come back, and for two segments take your calls.
[01:29:09.431 --> 01:29:18.219]  888-201-2244, or 512-646-1776, and I will try to refrain and just shut up and take your calls, because I want to get your response to this.
[01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:33.892]  I mean, the feds are saying they're taking over the entire internet, and local ISPs will have local federally certified commissar political officers over you, just like China, internet police, that are a private, corporate, privatized force.
[01:29:33.892 --> 01:29:35.294]  I mean, that's the bill!
[01:29:37.113 --> 01:29:43.995]  This is really going on, but only emergency control, but the feds will be hooked into all your local servers.
[01:29:43.995 --> 01:29:53.759]  So we're going to come back over your calls and then get into some flu news and some brief economic news as well.
[01:29:53.759 --> 01:29:57.120]  Again, the websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:57.700]  Stay with us!
[01:30:00.882 --> 01:30:02.264]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.264 --> 01:30:04.246]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:30:04.246 --> 01:30:04.887]  Well, you should.
[01:30:04.887 --> 01:30:09.732]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:30:09.732 --> 01:30:10.533]  That's right.
[01:30:10.533 --> 01:30:19.203]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:30:19.203 --> 01:30:20.564]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:20.564 --> 01:30:21.706]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:30:21.906 --> 01:30:27.890]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:34.774]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:30:34.774 --> 01:30:40.298]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:30:40.298 --> 01:30:41.759]  This is real.
[01:30:41.759 --> 01:30:42.819]  Don't miss out.

[01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:06.496]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:31:06.496 --> 01:31:10.520]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:16.426]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:16.426 --> 01:31:21.491]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:21.952]  Number three,
[01:31:22.392 --> 01:31:28.699]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:31:28.699 --> 01:31:31.603]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:31:31.603 --> 01:31:36.128]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.128 --> 01:31:39.732]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:39.972 --> 01:31:45.697]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:32:01.684 --> 01:32:04.687]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:04.687 --> 01:32:10.032]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:10.032 --> 01:32:12.074]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:12.074 --> 01:32:17.079]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:17.079 --> 01:32:18.000]  How much do you want?
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.381]  When do you want it?
[01:32:19.381 --> 01:32:21.262]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:21.262 --> 01:32:22.323]  When will you need it?
[01:32:22.323 --> 01:32:24.524]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:24.524 --> 01:32:25.865]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.865 --> 01:32:27.406]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:27.406 --> 01:32:32.669]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:32.669 --> 01:32:36.252]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:36.252 --> 01:32:39.714]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:40.074 --> 01:32:41.295]  How much will you need?
[01:32:41.295 --> 01:32:42.196]  We don't know.
[01:32:42.196 --> 01:32:43.298]  How much do you want?
[01:32:43.298 --> 01:32:44.239]  All you can get.
[01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:45.340]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:48.383]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:48.383 --> 01:32:50.165]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:50.165 --> 01:32:51.066]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:00.879 --> 01:33:05.123]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:33:05.123 --> 01:33:07.144]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:33:07.144 --> 01:33:15.652]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:33:15.652 --> 01:33:21.216]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:33:21.216 --> 01:33:22.838]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:33:23.058 --> 01:33:29.580]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:40.624]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:33:40.624 --> 01:33:41.404]  That's right.
[01:33:41.404 --> 01:33:43.965]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:33:43.965 --> 01:33:45.545]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:33:47.486 --> 01:33:48.126]  We are back live.
[01:33:48.126 --> 01:33:49.027]  Lennon Guardian just in.
[01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:23.174]  The opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, 54 years out of power.
[01:34:23.174 --> 01:34:37.202]  They are now in power, and their number two guy is a 9-11 truther and fan of this show, and has brought up the fact that the attacks of 9-11 were an inside job and played our videos in the Japanese diet.
[01:34:37.202 --> 01:34:41.044]  So, it's like having the vice president.
[01:34:41.044 --> 01:34:42.905]  Let's get him on, Fujita.
[01:34:42.905 --> 01:34:44.026]  Let's get him back on the show.
[01:34:45.157 --> 01:34:47.919]  I'll tell you, we're just having victory after victory against the New World Order.
[01:34:47.919 --> 01:34:49.521]  He's a really good guy.
[01:34:49.521 --> 01:34:58.368]  I got stories like, sheriff teacher jailed for drug conspiracy in Texas, but why get into that?
[01:34:58.368 --> 01:35:06.735]  I'd say, in East Texas and South Texas, more than half the sheriff's departments and police departments run the drugs.
[01:35:06.735 --> 01:35:10.899]  And if you come through their town and they find something wrong, they'll take your kids and sell them back to you.
[01:35:11.732 --> 01:35:15.854]  I mean, that's just how things... Government is run by a bunch of crooks!
[01:35:15.854 --> 01:35:19.556]  What is it you soft people out there haven't figured out yet?
[01:35:19.556 --> 01:35:22.758]  We've got hardcore crooks running our society.
[01:35:22.758 --> 01:35:27.941]  We better get control fast, or it'll be like the Soviet Union.
[01:35:27.941 --> 01:35:30.823]  But, I know, you're not going to listen until it happens to you, so go ahead.
[01:35:32.028 --> 01:35:40.335]  You watch, a lot of you are going to have your kids lining up in compulsory service, and you'll be like, yeah, the conspiracy theorist said this was going to happen, but I actually like it.
[01:35:40.335 --> 01:35:47.640]  You know, I mean, it just, look, I'm not trying to be mean to my general audience, but people who are in denial out there, I don't know what to say to you.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.543]  All right, I'm going to give each caller about a minute because I want to get to everybody.
[01:35:50.543 --> 01:35:53.925]  Archangel, Gene, Greg, Steve, Darren, Joe, Bill, others.
[01:35:53.925 --> 01:35:57.448]  Archangel in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:35:57.448 --> 01:35:58.249]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:35:59.608 --> 01:36:02.069]  Hey, just real quick, I want to bring up the speed on three things.
[01:36:02.069 --> 01:36:05.129]  Well, the first thing, I agree, they're going to make a move against us soon.
[01:36:05.129 --> 01:36:06.770]  False flag or something, they're going to hit us.
[01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:08.650]  And that's my first quick point.
[01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:11.051]  Second point is I got my posters all up.
[01:36:11.051 --> 01:36:13.831]  I got my posters all over my property and my flags.
[01:36:13.831 --> 01:36:16.812]  But the neighbors don't know what to think about it, but most of them agree.
[01:36:16.812 --> 01:36:18.872]  I've had two apparent almost-deaths.
[01:36:18.872 --> 01:36:21.333]  People tried, but I tried to stop and steal them.
[01:36:21.333 --> 01:36:22.993]  And I went out and stopped them.
[01:36:22.993 --> 01:36:24.894]  And then most people are offended.
[01:36:25.894 --> 01:36:32.177]  The blacks and the young whites, the yuppies are driving by, freaking out.
[01:36:32.177 --> 01:36:39.961]  For those that don't know, all over the country we've had this contest, and now all over the world, to put up Obama posters as socialist, fascist, it's all command and control.
[01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:42.462]  It's two different systems, but they confuse you with that.
[01:36:42.462 --> 01:36:48.545]  New World Order, Infowars.com, front page of the local section of the Toronto Star, our event.
[01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:57.932]  And videos are coming in of the yuppies coming over and grabbing them and ripping them and trying to attack people and saying, you have no free speech.
[01:36:57.932 --> 01:37:00.674]  And there's a video of police coming up.
[01:37:00.674 --> 01:37:05.537]  We have this at a town hall outside saying, you're not allowed to have a sign.
[01:37:05.537 --> 01:37:07.499]  And the guy says, I thought this was America.
[01:37:07.499 --> 01:37:12.162]  And the cop says, it isn't America anymore and laughs.
[01:37:12.162 --> 01:37:13.463]  This isn't America.
[01:37:13.463 --> 01:37:16.445]  In fact, we can pull that up.
[01:37:16.445 --> 01:37:17.066]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:17.588 --> 01:37:19.309]  That's funny.
[01:37:19.309 --> 01:37:25.272]  Cops came by the other night on their routine patrol, and they flashed their lights and siren away at him.
[01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:25.793]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:37:25.793 --> 01:37:26.513]  That's the issue.
[01:37:26.513 --> 01:37:27.514]  A lot of cops are good.
[01:37:27.514 --> 01:37:29.154]  They appreciate the First Amendment.
[01:37:29.154 --> 01:37:30.855]  And this is a racial thing.
[01:37:30.855 --> 01:37:34.517]  It's a black cop telling them you can't have a sign against Obama.
[01:37:34.517 --> 01:37:35.218]  In fact, here it is.
[01:37:35.218 --> 01:37:35.498]  Right here.
[01:37:35.498 --> 01:37:37.179]  In fact, cue this up.
[01:37:37.179 --> 01:37:38.920]  Back it up to the part where he says, here it is.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.161]  Why can it not be?
[01:37:40.161 --> 01:37:40.661]  It just can't be.
[01:37:42.042 --> 01:37:43.703]  Did you take a note to follow the Constitution?
[01:37:43.703 --> 01:37:44.283]  Yes, I did.
[01:37:44.283 --> 01:37:45.304]  You did?
[01:37:45.304 --> 01:37:45.604]  Yes.
[01:37:45.604 --> 01:37:46.224]  And on my job.
[01:37:46.224 --> 01:37:49.446]  My job said it can't be here, so I'm doing my job.
[01:37:49.446 --> 01:37:50.707]  Where does it say that in your job?
[01:37:50.707 --> 01:37:55.629]  Actually, school grounds have very different First Amendment rights than anywhere else.
[01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:56.030]  Anywhere.
[01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:58.011]  Churches, parks, and everything.
[01:37:58.011 --> 01:38:00.552]  But what's the difference between that and something here?
[01:38:00.552 --> 01:38:01.873]  And something there?
[01:38:01.873 --> 01:38:02.733]  And those over there?
[01:38:02.733 --> 01:38:04.554]  And those over there?
[01:38:04.554 --> 01:38:05.955]  But you got this with a picture.
[01:38:05.955 --> 01:38:06.735]  That's the difference.
[01:38:06.735 --> 01:38:07.716]  This got a picture on it.
[01:38:07.716 --> 01:38:08.196]  What does it mean?
[01:38:08.196 --> 01:38:09.057]  That don't have a picture on it.
[01:38:09.057 --> 01:38:10.377]  It doesn't have anybody.
[01:38:10.377 --> 01:38:10.717]  So what?
[01:38:11.838 --> 01:38:13.499]  Sir, leave the picture down.
[01:38:13.499 --> 01:38:17.623]  If you don't, if you put the picture back up, you will be charged with trespassing and you will have to go.
[01:38:17.623 --> 01:38:17.943]  Okay?
[01:38:17.943 --> 01:38:18.524]  Well, wait a second.
[01:38:18.524 --> 01:38:19.645]  I'm charged with trespassing?
[01:38:19.645 --> 01:38:20.465]  I said you will be.
[01:38:20.465 --> 01:38:21.946]  But that's not trespassing, haven't it?
[01:38:21.946 --> 01:38:25.990]  If I told you once to take it down and you put it back up, then I can charge you whatever I want to charge you with.
[01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.110]  Okay?
[01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:28.212]  So I'm telling you not to... So you break the law too?
[01:38:31.138 --> 01:38:33.318]  Put the picture down, sir.
[01:38:33.318 --> 01:38:33.619]  Thank you.
[01:38:33.619 --> 01:38:34.759]  This is America!
[01:38:34.759 --> 01:38:36.019]  This used to be America!
[01:38:36.019 --> 01:38:37.479]  It ain't no more, okay?
[01:38:37.479 --> 01:38:38.220]  I know it ain't!
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:40.500]  That's the point of the picture!
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.340]  That's it, I can't watch it anymore.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:46.681]  I mean, he's in uniform saying, this ain't America no more!
[01:38:46.681 --> 01:38:48.022]  Sit down!
[01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:50.442]  Now, this is out in a high school parking lot.
[01:38:50.442 --> 01:38:53.403]  There's people for and against government health care.
[01:38:53.403 --> 01:38:56.464]  This guy's got one as Obama the Joker.
[01:38:56.464 --> 01:38:57.784]  As usual, one of our listeners.
[01:38:58.726 --> 01:39:02.929]  And he's told, hey, you're not allowed to have that.
[01:39:02.929 --> 01:39:05.791]  Now, again, it's white yuppies mainly that come over.
[01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:08.513]  That's the first time I've seen a black person.
[01:39:08.513 --> 01:39:14.658]  But the issue is that they're crazy.
[01:39:14.658 --> 01:39:15.578]  And they're nuts.
[01:39:15.578 --> 01:39:19.862]  And that's why we've got to put more of these signs up, letting them know we're not going to give in to their intimidation.
[01:39:19.862 --> 01:39:21.563]  Archangel, finish up what you were saying.
[01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:24.771]  Like I said, I have them.
[01:39:24.771 --> 01:39:26.012]  They're all over my lawn.
[01:39:26.012 --> 01:39:27.574]  They're in every window in my house.
[01:39:27.574 --> 01:39:29.615]  It looks like the United Nations when you run, go by.
[01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:34.499]  I have like 15 flags hanging and about 30 posters.
[01:39:34.499 --> 01:39:36.741]  So it looks great, but my neighbors are peaking.
[01:39:36.741 --> 01:39:45.329]  On the third thing, the most important thing, on the G20 Pittsburgh gun confiscation ban that they're trying to do, myself,
[01:39:45.809 --> 01:39:47.671]  In fact, I'm like somebody with ten
[01:40:11.365 --> 01:40:13.708]  Baseball pitching machines shooting balls at me.
[01:40:13.708 --> 01:40:15.611]  That's why it's good we take calls.
[01:40:15.611 --> 01:40:18.575]  Guys, get on that Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Friday.
[01:40:18.575 --> 01:40:24.784]  They're going to ban assault weapons in the city, which is any semi-auto or multiple shot handgun or rifle.
[01:40:24.784 --> 01:40:27.988]  And then that allows them, quote, in emergencies, whenever they say
[01:40:28.829 --> 01:40:34.371]  to violate the Second Amendment and they announced four G20 meetings, the last one they had in the U.S.
[01:40:34.371 --> 01:40:37.132]  and in other countries that you're under martial law.
[01:40:37.132 --> 01:40:41.873]  The headline in Canada is Chinese-style martial law for Olympics.
[01:40:41.873 --> 01:40:51.236]  So they're training us any way they can, anytime, that your Second Amendment's bad when the real owners that, by the way this is in
[01:40:53.271 --> 01:40:55.512]  Let me find the article here.
[01:40:55.512 --> 01:40:58.192]  This is in a major scientific journal.
[01:40:58.192 --> 01:41:13.836]  Yeah, Inside Science had a top analysis of 48 countries by top scientists and computer physicists of the world economy and found that only a few global banks actually own basically everything.
[01:41:14.918 --> 01:41:18.480]  So, so, again, and they've created it all through fiat.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.002]  It's made up money, and they admit that.
[01:41:21.002 --> 01:41:25.204]  So the issue here is, is that these are the real owners.
[01:41:25.204 --> 01:41:26.625]  In fact, I appreciate your call, Archangel.
[01:41:26.625 --> 01:41:27.446]  Just great points.
[01:41:27.446 --> 01:41:30.428]  Let's get somebody on about the assault weapons ban.
[01:41:30.428 --> 01:41:30.988]  That's what I mean.
[01:41:30.988 --> 01:41:31.869]  I can't.
[01:41:31.869 --> 01:41:32.789]  Here's another one.
[01:41:32.789 --> 01:41:36.772]  AP has been sued, and they've lost in Dutch court.
[01:41:36.772 --> 01:41:41.875]  But under the Dutch system, the German royalty, the same family that runs England, the House of Orange,
[01:41:43.519 --> 01:41:47.281]  It's illegal to photograph them, or to talk about them.
[01:41:47.281 --> 01:41:56.865]  See, government makes itself God, where it's all secret, and when you're government, you're queen, and then you have no rights, no privacy, and the government gets more rights than privacy.
[01:41:56.865 --> 01:41:58.346]  It's the boss, you're the slave.
[01:41:58.346 --> 01:42:07.970]  They were in Argentina skiing in a lake at a popular resort, and AP took a photo, and they're talking about millions of dollars in fines.
[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:10.211]  In fact, Google that for folks.
[01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:12.512]  Dutch royal family wins suit, I'll bring it up.
[01:42:13.132 --> 01:42:21.758]  And they're saying, you can't photograph royalty worldwide, but you can photograph anybody else in public, but not royalty!
[01:42:21.758 --> 01:42:27.803]  Because they're the bastards that own Dutch Rochelle, BP, they own the banks, I'm just sick of it!
[01:42:27.803 --> 01:42:41.273]  I photographed Queen Beatrix, and I'll go on doing it at Bilderberg, in 2006, it's in my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, I photographed her, and I'm gonna go on photographing her, meeting with world leaders to set up world government.
[01:42:42.242 --> 01:42:44.963]  I've got that witch crone on video, and I'll do it.
[01:42:44.963 --> 01:42:45.463]  But you know what?
[01:42:45.463 --> 01:42:46.664]  They had me arrested.
[01:42:46.664 --> 01:42:48.244]  They told me I was under arrest.
[01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:50.485]  When I got off the plane, they said, you're here for the conference.
[01:42:50.485 --> 01:42:55.007]  And they threw my butt in handcuffs and slammed me in the wall.
[01:42:55.007 --> 01:43:02.990]  And they kept me for 15 hours until I got a message out to the media that showed up to get my butt out of the airport security and customs.
[01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:04.331]  I've been put
[01:43:05.988 --> 01:43:10.092]  In a jail cell by this piece of trash who thinks I'm her slave.
[01:43:10.092 --> 01:43:13.334]  Listen to me, Queen Beatrix, you don't own me, you Genesis!
[01:43:13.334 --> 01:43:19.119]  You're a Nazi father that set up the World Wildlife Fund and was a top Nazi and wants to fund eugenics.
[01:43:19.119 --> 01:43:20.260]  I'm sick of you!
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:23.723]  We cover it in my film, Endgame.
[01:43:23.723 --> 01:43:27.927]  Just at a fundamental level, I am not this piece of trash's slave.
[01:43:27.927 --> 01:43:29.949]  You can't photograph the God.
[01:43:29.949 --> 01:43:31.810]  Dutch Royals win privacy case.
[01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.351]  And the media
[01:43:33.598 --> 01:43:38.682]  He's not even allowed to talk about him in the Netherlands.
[01:43:38.682 --> 01:43:42.085]  I mean, what type of freedom is that where these people are gods?
[01:43:42.085 --> 01:43:47.749]  At the Bilderberg group meeting, they tell the maids and people not to even look at the Bilderberg members.
[01:43:47.749 --> 01:43:50.571]  And they just walk around treating the help like total crap.
[01:43:50.571 --> 01:43:57.457]  The help never wants to spy on them for us before the event, but after they just give us everything going, these are inhuman trash.
[01:43:57.457 --> 01:43:58.477]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:43:58.477 --> 01:43:58.978]  Stay with us!
[01:44:00.751 --> 01:44:06.058]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:44:06.058 --> 01:44:08.141]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:10.584]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:44:10.584 --> 01:44:12.867]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:44:12.867 --> 01:44:14.489]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:44:14.489 --> 01:44:15.531]  There is a solution.
[01:44:15.751 --> 01:44:24.177]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:06.064]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:45:31.301 --> 01:45:31.801]  We're good.
[01:46:00.816 --> 01:46:02.177]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:46:02.177 --> 01:46:04.179]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:46:04.179 --> 01:46:05.160]  Well, you should.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.665]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:46:09.665 --> 01:46:10.466]  That's right.
[01:46:10.466 --> 01:46:19.134]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:46:19.134 --> 01:46:20.476]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:46:20.476 --> 01:46:21.637]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:46:21.817 --> 01:46:27.802]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:46:27.802 --> 01:46:34.708]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:46:34.708 --> 01:46:40.233]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:46:40.233 --> 01:46:41.694]  This is real.
[01:46:41.694 --> 01:46:42.755]  Don't miss out.
[01:46:42.755 --> 01:46:49.621]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:46:49.941 --> 01:47:04.507]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:47:04.507 --> 01:47:09.829]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:47:09.829 --> 01:47:11.890]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:47:11.890 --> 01:47:16.892]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:47:16.892 --> 01:47:17.812]  How much do you want?
[01:47:18.052 --> 01:47:19.173]  When do you want it?
[01:47:19.173 --> 01:47:21.055]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:47:21.055 --> 01:47:22.135]  When will you need it?
[01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:24.337]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:25.678]  Will there be any food?
[01:47:25.678 --> 01:47:27.220]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:32.484]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:47:32.484 --> 01:47:36.067]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:47:36.067 --> 01:47:39.530]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:41.091]  How much will you need?
[01:47:41.091 --> 01:47:42.012]  We don't know.
[01:47:42.012 --> 01:47:43.113]  How much do you want?
[01:47:43.113 --> 01:47:44.034]  All you can get.
[01:47:44.034 --> 01:47:45.135]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:47:45.135 --> 01:47:48.178]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:47:48.178 --> 01:47:49.960]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:50.880]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:48:13.334 --> 01:48:24.593]  Yeah, if you search engine the term in-game trailer, you can see when I videotaped from 200 yards away, Queen Beatrix had a super zoom on the camera.
[01:48:28.437 --> 01:48:33.041]  And they tried to have police come out and tell the Canadian newspapers they couldn't be there taking photos.
[01:48:33.041 --> 01:48:34.522]  And the papers said, go ahead and arrest us.
[01:48:34.522 --> 01:48:37.744]  I mean, we gotta say no to these bastards!
[01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:43.289]  But they got some kangaroo court they own and run in the Netherlands telling the Associated Press they can't take photos of them?
[01:48:44.462 --> 01:48:47.883]  I mean, you can't take photos of somebody in their backyard if it's got a fence.
[01:48:47.883 --> 01:48:49.864]  There is the perception of privacy.
[01:48:49.864 --> 01:48:54.246]  But if there's not the perception of privacy, you don't have it!
[01:48:54.246 --> 01:48:55.907]  Look, it just makes me mad.
[01:48:55.907 --> 01:48:57.847]  Gene in Georgia, go ahead, then others.
[01:48:57.847 --> 01:49:00.368]  Go ahead, Gene.
[01:49:00.368 --> 01:49:02.309]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:02.309 --> 01:49:03.209]  Can you hear me?
[01:49:03.209 --> 01:49:04.110]  Yes, we've got to move quick.
[01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:05.330]  Go ahead.
[01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:11.753]  Okay, at notaxesnow.org, we've got a plan to take the money away from the international bankers
[01:49:12.786 --> 01:49:15.349]  Uh, Eric Williams has a 28th Amendment to the U.S.
[01:49:15.349 --> 01:49:17.631]  Constitution to do just that.
[01:49:17.631 --> 01:49:23.798]  Basically what that is, is that instead of, uh, taxes being used to pay interest to the international bankers,
[01:49:28.518 --> 01:49:34.943]  Yes it was.
[01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:35.844]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:35.844 --> 01:49:41.488]  For thousands of years they've used the banking Ponzi scheme of rational reserve to take over.
[01:49:41.488 --> 01:49:44.331]  We didn't have the income tax until 1913.
[01:49:44.331 --> 01:49:51.116]  All the money you pay in income tax goes to interest to the private banks who give us the pleasure of printing our own money.
[01:49:51.116 --> 01:49:52.257]  An example of this is
[01:49:54.525 --> 01:50:04.070]  Trillions are raised, trillions, every couple years just on truck driving taxes and freight taxes and tariffs.
[01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:05.690]  That's what really runs the government.
[01:50:05.690 --> 01:50:08.692]  The income tax was passed with the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:50:08.692 --> 01:50:10.152]  That's how they rape us.
[01:50:10.152 --> 01:50:14.194]  Now they're setting up the Bank of the World with a carbon tax to rape you even further.
[01:50:14.194 --> 01:50:16.355]  And I'm sure people are going to love it.
[01:50:16.355 --> 01:50:18.456]  Let's talk to Stephen Houston.
[01:50:18.456 --> 01:50:19.657]  Stephen Houston, you're on the air.
[01:50:20.609 --> 01:50:22.131]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:50:22.131 --> 01:50:28.777]  Hey, before I get to why I called, which is, you know, this thing about back in Limbaugh versus you, I just wanted to say this.
[01:50:28.777 --> 01:50:36.325]  A couple weeks ago on your weekday show, you were talking about how this just grieves you and weighs you down, all this knowledge that you have.
[01:50:36.325 --> 01:50:38.827]  And you were asking for a specific scripture.
[01:50:38.827 --> 01:50:40.689]  It's in Ecclesiastes 118.
[01:50:40.689 --> 01:50:43.172]  It says, for in much wisdom is much grief.
[01:50:43.852 --> 01:50:44.433]  I don't think so.
[01:51:08.667 --> 01:51:12.109]  You know, the Bible says, for the love of money is the root of all evil.
[01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:17.012]  You've quoted many times that quote from Mark Twain about what a true patriot is.
[01:51:17.012 --> 01:51:21.514]  And the thing is, these guys, as far as I'm concerned, they're not true patriots.
[01:51:21.514 --> 01:51:25.237]  I believe, like you said, that Beck's an operative.
[01:51:25.237 --> 01:51:27.598]  Limbaugh's just a poster boy for the neocons.
[01:51:27.998 --> 01:51:41.184]  But these guys have too much to lose monetarily and positionally, whereas you, you're doing this because you're just an American and a patriot that's standing for what you believe and know is right.
[01:51:41.184 --> 01:51:48.648]  And I'll tell you something, Alex, I had a guy about a month ago, you know, I was talking about this stuff, and he says, well, you know, I'm just one guy.
[01:51:48.648 --> 01:51:49.809]  What can one guy do?
[01:51:49.809 --> 01:51:52.390]  But I thought, well, I know of one guy
[01:51:53.010 --> 01:52:07.454]  In Austin, Texas, and he's done a whole bunch, and I know you're not the only one, but I'll tell you something, from what I've seen, and I've been on board with this for, you know, ten years or so now, as far as exposing the New World Order and what they're about.
[01:52:07.454 --> 01:52:18.037]  I don't know of anybody, there's others out there, but you, as far as I'm concerned, are the most passionate about this, and fighting this cause of liberty against
[01:52:19.397 --> 01:52:21.338]  Steve, I appreciate the kind words.
[01:52:21.338 --> 01:52:24.719]  I'm going to move on to other folks because the phone system was down the first hour and a half.
[01:52:24.719 --> 01:52:30.080]  I don't want to get to everybody, but why do I have the big foundations attacking me?
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.441]  Why do I have the mainstream media attacking me?
[01:52:32.441 --> 01:52:35.201]  Why do I have the alternative media attacking me?
[01:52:35.201 --> 01:52:38.762]  A lot of them are government paid for.
[01:52:38.762 --> 01:52:42.023]  But they're getting ready to shut down even the mainline opposition
[01:52:43.362 --> 01:52:46.163]  of Talk Radio, and they've introduced the bills to do it.
[01:52:46.163 --> 01:52:49.724]  So, and if they can do it with those guys, they can do it with everybody.
[01:52:49.724 --> 01:52:51.705]  This is serious.
[01:52:51.705 --> 01:52:55.306]  They're talking about a new code the feds are going to run over media.
[01:52:55.306 --> 01:52:58.068]  We've got to say no.
[01:52:58.068 --> 01:52:59.588]  Let's talk to Darren in Ireland.
[01:52:59.588 --> 01:53:00.749]  Darren, I would have gone to you earlier.
[01:53:00.749 --> 01:53:03.790]  I saw you were calling in from great old Ireland.
[01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:04.470]  Welcome, Darren.
[01:53:05.635 --> 01:53:09.600]  Hello Alex Jones, I'm a huge fan and thanks for taking my call.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:15.368]  I know it's late here in Ireland but I really have to get through with some urgent news on the Lisbon Tree.
[01:53:15.368 --> 01:53:20.154]  It's in October and the propaganda is going absolutely crazy.
[01:53:20.154 --> 01:53:22.157]  For those that don't know then I'll have you comment on it.
[01:53:22.637 --> 01:53:27.180]  You guys have said no repeatedly, so has England to the Lisbon Treaty.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.822]  They let a few countries, France and one other vote on it.
[01:53:29.822 --> 01:53:32.184]  They said no and they say we don't care.
[01:53:32.184 --> 01:53:39.709]  We're going to keep trying to pass it till you pass it or we'll just have the bureaucracy fold you into Europe whether you like it or not.
[01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:42.251]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:42.251 --> 01:53:48.258]  We've been fighting this fight for the past six to seven hundred years and our Constitution is only 72 years old.
[01:53:48.258 --> 01:53:49.099]  Well, take care!
[01:53:49.099 --> 01:53:54.645]  They won't even tell us we're officially under a North American Union since March 24th, 2005.
[01:53:54.645 --> 01:53:58.670]  The treaty's now public and the average yuppie just sucks their thumb all day with pleasure.
[01:53:59.491 --> 01:54:08.339]  I know Alex, it's crazy and I would like to come on maybe in the future and discuss the live entry before... Is this one of the guys from We Are Change Ireland?
[01:54:08.339 --> 01:54:22.091]  Yes, I am and I want to discuss the relationship between Ireland and the United States of the revolution that spread to Ireland and which... This is Darren, I forget your last name, you're one of the founders of We Are Change, you're a filmmaker too.
[01:54:22.091 --> 01:54:23.872]  What's your last name?
[01:54:23.872 --> 01:54:24.493]  Mac Neillis.
[01:54:25.888 --> 01:54:30.834]  Yeah, uh, okay so you're, uh, well then who are the We Are Change From Ireland guys I've had on?
[01:54:30.834 --> 01:54:33.017]  One of them's named Darren as well.
[01:54:33.017 --> 01:54:34.960]  But you're Scottish, living in Ireland.
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.184]  Well no, I'm actually, uh, just a second name Scottish, actually.
[01:54:38.184 --> 01:54:39.565]  I'm fully Irish, anyway.
[01:54:39.565 --> 01:54:40.406]  Okay, whatever.
[01:54:40.406 --> 01:54:42.129]  Okay, but haven't I had you on before?
[01:54:43.315 --> 01:54:46.796]  No, I was on the Jefferson-Burma Show twice, maybe a few times.
[01:54:46.796 --> 01:54:49.638]  Look, I'm going to put you on hold, send us your info, okay?
[01:54:49.638 --> 01:54:52.759]  Speaking of Burmas, he's coming up for three hours at Infowars.com.
[01:54:52.759 --> 01:54:59.181]  Yes, we need to get all the We Are Change guys, Ireland and UK and Scotland, on to talk about fighting the globalists.
[01:54:59.181 --> 01:55:00.582]  We're defending our sovereignty.
[01:55:00.582 --> 01:55:03.443]  You go, well, world government's the next step.
[01:55:03.443 --> 01:55:09.285]  Even if you're for world government, the world government being set up is a tyrannical, authoritarian system.
[01:55:10.796 --> 01:55:12.677]  Let's talk to Joe in Illinois.
[01:55:12.677 --> 01:55:13.637]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:55:13.637 --> 01:55:14.077]  Go ahead.
[01:55:14.077 --> 01:55:15.518]  Hello, Alex.
[01:55:15.518 --> 01:55:17.579]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:55:17.579 --> 01:55:21.240]  I just wanted to connect a few dots for you on the Federal Reserve.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:29.384]  We've been attacked by the numbers 9-11 and with the Dow dropping down and bottoming out at 6,660.
[01:55:29.384 --> 01:55:33.305]  You know yourself that the Satanists are definitely pulling some strings there.
[01:55:33.305 --> 01:55:33.666]  Correct?
[01:55:33.666 --> 01:55:36.647]  3-11 in Madrid, 7-7 in England.
[01:55:36.647 --> 01:55:38.908]  They're obsessed with numerology.
[01:55:38.908 --> 01:55:39.328]  All right.
[01:55:40.481 --> 01:55:56.005]  If you take 1913, December 23rd, and run it on, say, a 99-year lease, which is the favorite government time block for any lease or ownership, you come up right at the Mayans' Doomsday.
[01:55:56.005 --> 01:55:58.025]  So, just thought you'd appreciate that.
[01:55:58.025 --> 01:56:00.186]  Wait a minute, 99 years goes to 2012?
[01:56:02.952 --> 01:56:03.712]  I guess that's true.
[01:56:03.712 --> 01:56:05.573]  What is it, December 23rd, 24th?
[01:56:05.573 --> 01:56:07.213]  They pass it at midnight.
[01:56:07.213 --> 01:56:12.835]  1913 Federal Reserve Act handing us over to private offshore banks.
[01:56:12.835 --> 01:56:13.796]  99 years would end in 2012.
[01:56:13.796 --> 01:56:14.296]  Right.
[01:56:14.296 --> 01:56:18.417]  So we might be looking at a bank holiday then.
[01:56:18.417 --> 01:56:19.578]  We might be looking at the Amaro.
[01:56:19.578 --> 01:56:26.480]  It's hard to tell how these guys are going to play it, but you can bet they're going to do something.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.061]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:28.061 --> 01:56:28.921]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:30.523 --> 01:56:40.485]  By the way, I keep getting calls and emails from listeners asking, thinking that we're timing what's behind us on this TV screen at PrisonPlanet.TV for what we're talking about.
[01:56:40.485 --> 01:56:46.006]  No, these are all the headlines of the last year and a half at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:46.006 --> 01:56:49.087]  They just imported that, and I think it's kind of interesting.
[01:56:49.087 --> 01:56:53.448]  We're going to mix some other stuff into that as well, but that's a slideshow of past stories.
[01:56:55.145 --> 01:57:02.148]  Though sometimes I'll be talking about flu, and that's what pops up behind me, but it's not a... People are like, why did that pop up when he said that?
[01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:05.509]  Let's see what comes up next.
[01:57:05.509 --> 01:57:09.211]  Missouri Democrat, poor, too irresponsible to exercise 2nd Amendment.
[01:57:09.211 --> 01:57:10.531]  This type of crazy articles.
[01:57:10.531 --> 01:57:11.892]  That was about a month ago.
[01:57:11.892 --> 01:57:13.173]  Here's another headline.
[01:57:13.173 --> 01:57:18.175]  No room for info warriors in YouTube's hula-zized universe.
[01:57:18.175 --> 01:57:20.536]  That's another blast from the past.
[01:57:20.536 --> 01:57:22.016]  Let's take another call quickly.
[01:57:22.016 --> 01:57:23.437]  Bill in Texas, go ahead.
[01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:26.052]  Alex, I just want to know one thing.
[01:57:26.052 --> 01:57:29.598]  I have school-age children and I want to know how I can keep them from getting...
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:32.802]  Swine flu shot without going to jail.
[01:57:32.802 --> 01:57:33.702]  How do I keep from going to jail?
[01:58:00.376 --> 01:58:03.039]  Well, they can say under level 6.
[01:58:03.039 --> 01:58:06.203]  Now they're saying, oh, we go to level 7 now.
[01:58:06.203 --> 01:58:07.564]  6.2 is what we're at.
[01:58:07.564 --> 01:58:09.787]  So they keep trying to raise the fear monitoring.
[01:58:09.787 --> 01:58:13.010]  It's like spinal tap, where he goes, why not just have all the dials go to 10?
[01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:15.393]  He goes, but it's 11.
[01:58:15.393 --> 01:58:16.915]  So they've now had the dials go to 11, 6.2.
[01:58:20.592 --> 01:58:22.433]  They're not going to be able to enforce this on everybody.
[01:58:22.433 --> 01:58:24.954]  They just want to set the precedent and fearmonger.
[01:58:24.954 --> 01:58:26.635]  People are already standing up to them.
[01:58:26.635 --> 01:58:32.118]  Plus, you have a religious exemption, conscientious exemption in every state and every major country.
[01:58:32.118 --> 01:58:32.859]  God bless you, sir.
[01:58:32.859 --> 01:58:33.819]  We're out of time.
[01:58:33.819 --> 01:58:37.701]  I had a bunch of flu news I actually meant to get to.
[01:58:37.701 --> 01:58:39.723]  But regardless, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:58:39.723 --> 01:58:42.704]  Central, 12 noon, and back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:42.704 --> 01:58:48.788]  Great job to all the affiliates, all the stations, to Paul Hartman and their running things.
[01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:49.268]  God bless you.
[01:58:50.854 --> 01:58:56.161]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:56.161 --> 01:59:00.687]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.687 --> 01:59:02.970]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.970 --> 01:59:04.592]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.592 --> 01:59:05.614]  There is a solution.
[01:59:05.854 --> 01:59:14.286]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:59:14.286 --> 01:59:21.736]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:59:21.736 --> 01:59:27.403]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
