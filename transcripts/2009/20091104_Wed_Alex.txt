[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.756]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.337]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:12.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:17.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:21.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:42.173]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have wide open phones with a full four hours today.
[00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:57.178]  We have Dr. Rima Labo and Major General Stubblebine joining us in the third and fourth hour today, but we'll have open phones when they're on with us for your questions about the flu, about the eugenics mass extermination plan.
[00:00:57.178 --> 00:01:03.680]  We can even ask General Stubblebine about the book, Men Who Stare at Goats, made into a major movie with George Clooney and others.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.884]  That he has stated is basically disinformation.
[00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:12.810]  I'll bring that up just because that movie I believe is coming out this Friday, but it hasn't already come out.
[00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.553]  I've just seen the ads everywhere the last month.
[00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:18.577]  Our good little buddy John Ronson wrote that book.
[00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.480]  He also wrote them.
[00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:30.920]  Which is dark satire and I'm one of the main or the main character in the book and that was his first book on Conspiracy Theorist.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:45.335]  He made the five-part mini-series for international television airing in the US, England, Europe, you name it, called Secret Rulers of the World and in it he makes fun of us for believing in a world government.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:52.632]  He has since then recanted on this radio show and on Coast to Coast AM and others and said, no, he was wrong.
[00:01:52.632 --> 00:01:56.794]  There is a world government and a lot of what the conspiracy theorists have to say is true.
[00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:57.955]  In fact, I've been forgetting.
[00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:01.257]  Let's get John Ronson back on.
[00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:02.358]  Let's get Ronson on.
[00:02:02.358 --> 00:02:05.159]  Why not just get him on?
[00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.803]  But side issue, just thought I would think aloud here on air with everyone.
[00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:25.316]  His book was optioned, not just Ministery of Goats, but them was optioned by a major Hollywood outfit, and they are yet to make a movie out of that.
[00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:29.600]  I wonder who they're going to get to play good old Alex Jones.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.946]  Jack Black is set to play that part, but you know, they option a lot of books and don't turn them into movies.
[00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:48.508]  It certainly ups the chances that they are, because they've turned Men Who Stare at Goats into a major, huge, big-budget film.
[00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:52.449]  But maybe I should not be too pleased about that.
[00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:57.432]  Maybe I should hope that they don't make them, because can you imagine what they're going to make me look like?
[00:02:57.432 --> 00:02:58.992]  A complete clown, probably.
[00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:01.193]  Oh, that's another issue!
[00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:02.914]  I talked to Jesse Ventura last week.
[00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:12.459]  And Time Warner that's putting out his TV show on TruTV hasn't wanted to do any interviews until the 3rd.
[00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.163]  It's now the 4th, so we're gonna be getting him on sometime next week.
[00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:21.848]  He kicked it off with the promotion of his new TV show on Larry King Live last night.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.743]  And Jesse believes this is going to be more than just a fair presentation.
[00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:38.908]  He believes this is going to be the first national television program, with his perspective, where he believes the conspiracy theory and believes that he goes out and proves them.
[00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:44.030]  He looks at both sides, but he's telling me that it's going to be fair.
[00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.413]  I don't know how that's going to happen with Time Warner, but we have the
[00:03:53.217 --> 00:04:03.003]  Intro to the TV show, I'm gonna be playing that later in the broadcast, and he intros it by saying, you don't think conspiracies are real?
[00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:04.523]  They are!
[00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:06.685]  And I go out and prove it.
[00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:11.107]  And I was a consultant on the show, and it looks more than fair.
[00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:14.689]  It looks like it's slanted towards reality, towards our side.
[00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.491]  But I know Time Warner's got their hands in it, and they're still editing some of it.
[00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.733]  It starts premiering December 2nd.
[00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:39.273]  starts premiering December 2nd and then airs into January and I am in five of the seven episodes seven episodes and I consulted on it but I'm
[00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.042]  Holding my breath here.
[00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:46.426]  I don't know how long I can hold it to see what this is, but you'll be the judge.
[00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:47.868]  Of course, I'll be the judge as well.
[00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:49.769]  All right, I haven't even gotten to the news.
[00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:50.990]  Obviously, it's off the charts.
[00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.914]  Gold above $1,093 right now.
[00:04:54.914 --> 00:04:57.016]  Dollar plunging and free fall.
[00:04:57.016 --> 00:04:57.936]  Huge news.
[00:04:57.936 --> 00:04:59.438]  Global government openly being announced.
[00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:03.817]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.817 --> 00:05:09.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.201]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:16.203]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:17.383]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.504]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:20.385]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:21.465]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:23.666]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.007]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:26.527]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.588]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:29.070]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.793]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.793 --> 00:05:35.378]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:39.203]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.203 --> 00:05:40.444]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:41.345]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:42.447]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.447 --> 00:05:43.188]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:44.189]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.491]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:55.036]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:55.036 --> 00:05:56.257]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:56.257 --> 00:06:06.024]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:09.286]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.687]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:14.071]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:20.457]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.457 --> 00:06:26.002]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:35.651]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.092]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.092 --> 00:06:39.693]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.693 --> 00:06:42.135]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.276]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:49.419]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.382]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.382 --> 00:07:00.666]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.607]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:05.109]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:07:06.098 --> 00:07:19.567]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to FluScam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:31.135]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:35.017]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:42.901]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:48.444]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:51.585]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:54.547]  Call toll-free 888-KO-GERMS.
[00:07:54.547 --> 00:07:57.208]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:58.689]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:07:58.689 --> 00:07:59.950]  This call could save your life.
[00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:06.012]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.012 --> 00:08:08.352]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.352 --> 00:08:26.338]  Global cover-ups.
[00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:27.018]  Mind control.
[00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:30.971]  Secret societies.
[00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:34.314]  You don't think this stuff is real?
[00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:35.455]  Think again.
[00:08:35.455 --> 00:08:37.998]  I've heard things that'll blow your mind.
[00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:41.761]  I've been on the inside.
[00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:44.544]  And now, I'm ready to talk.
[00:08:44.544 --> 00:08:46.646]  Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:48.647]  Airs Wednesday, December 2nd.
[00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:50.229]  Only on True TV.
[00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:51.750]  A reality.
[00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.391]  Actuality.
[00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.651]  And we're live later on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:01.412]  We're going to go live at 1230 Central Standard Time, an hour and a half into the show.
[00:09:01.412 --> 00:09:06.374]  I will play some promo clips from the TV show.
[00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:16.137]  And this television program is from Ventura's perspective that it is real.
[00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:23.700]  And that the New World Order is real and eugenics is real and HAARP is a weapon
[00:09:24.717 --> 00:09:27.632]  That there is mind control, that there are secret societies.
[00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:44.447]  We will see what happens, but again in the past the mainstream media wouldn't let anything like this on television and they still produce hit pieces every month that we see demonizing conspiracy theorists and people that question world government.
[00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:58.074]  But now with thousands of publications a month, I mean it's thousands, sometimes it's thousands a week, we've live on television here and on the radio typed in the term New World Order, clicked news on the search engine and it's been
[00:09:59.994 --> 00:10:05.722]  12,000 articles with New World Order and global government in it in one week a few months ago with the G20.
[00:10:05.722 --> 00:10:08.006]  It's over a thousand every week right now.
[00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:12.792]  I've seen it over 12,000 articles in one week.
[00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:15.997]  Because the first Google News block will be the last seven days.
[00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:23.293]  Over 12,000 admitting everything we've ever said, but saying it's good.
[00:10:23.293 --> 00:10:30.016]  See, the only difference is, we said it was real, detailed the architecture of the system, and said it was bad.
[00:10:30.016 --> 00:10:36.758]  They now have reversed themselves and are admitting it's all real, but are saying it's good.
[00:10:36.758 --> 00:10:46.182]  Ventura comes out and says it's bad, and I guess the television networks are desperate for ratings so they'll allow some of this on air.
[00:10:46.182 --> 00:10:46.522]  I don't know.
[00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:50.865]  We'll see what is going to happen with this.
[00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:52.026]  I know Jesse's a good guy.
[00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.567]  I know he has a good heart.
[00:10:53.567 --> 00:10:54.807]  And I know he's learned a lot.
[00:10:54.807 --> 00:10:56.228]  We've taught him a lot.
[00:10:56.228 --> 00:10:57.269]  He's come a long way.
[00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:09.256]  A couple weeks ago, the last time I was in Los Angeles shooting a couple final clips for the television program, we were talking at the hotel.
[00:11:12.008 --> 00:11:16.433]  The night before a shoot and he said, Alex, I lay in bed every night now.
[00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:23.541]  And for the first time in my life, my mind just spins and everything's opening up and I'm learning so much so fast.
[00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:30.088]  And, you know, I didn't think a lot of this stuff was real, but now I'm wondering how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:32.371]  And that's the experience that we all go through.
[00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:39.569]  So I'm very, very excited about this television program on TruTV.
[00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:41.530]  It's a small series, seven parts.
[00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.531]  A big one would be 14 parts.
[00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:44.971]  A regular series is about nine.
[00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.833]  And I hope it's a good TV show.
[00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:52.815]  I hope it gets picked up again for a second season, obviously, because I'm going to be involved in it.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.222]  But very, very exciting.
[00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:06.205]  Okay, I'm gonna get into that a little bit more later.
[00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:10.148]  In my stack of news, GOP sweep.
[00:12:10.148 --> 00:12:17.354]  Big Brother victories.
[00:12:17.354 --> 00:12:21.297]  GOP sweep.
[00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:25.100]  Big Brother has a big fat victory.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.481]  That's my Freudian slip.
[00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:32.887]  Because that's the truth.
[00:12:32.887 --> 00:12:38.590]  Am I saying it's a bad thing that Republicans won in Virginia and New Jersey?
[00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.071]  No.
[00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:44.013]  Am I saying it's a good thing?
[00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.175]  No.
[00:12:47.175 --> 00:12:54.138]  It is a sign of desperation by the American people.
[00:12:54.138 --> 00:12:57.900]  The Republicans have incredibly low approval ratings and so do the Democrats.
[00:13:00.063 --> 00:13:06.526]  The media always spins it and says, oh, Obama's not worried about the races in Virginia and New Jersey.
[00:13:06.526 --> 00:13:08.627]  Democrats are going to win there.
[00:13:08.627 --> 00:13:17.132]  This isn't going to be a sign that his star has fallen.
[00:13:17.132 --> 00:13:22.695]  This isn't going to signify that he's in trouble, even if they do lose.
[00:13:24.687 --> 00:13:26.448]  But of course that's a lie, that's spin.
[00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:29.149]  It does signify that Obama's in deep trouble.
[00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:37.073]  But that doesn't matter because he's a puppet of the private Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase cartel.
[00:13:37.073 --> 00:13:44.337]  The good news in all of this, the silver lining, is that it shows that the people are not happy with the system.
[00:13:44.337 --> 00:13:50.140]  But again, the system is broken and so it's only going to create more frustration and anger.
[00:13:51.274 --> 00:14:10.388]  George Bush, eight years of nightmare policies, massively unpopular, Obama is swept into office, he breaks every promise he made, brings in even bigger government than George Bush, spending more money than Bush spent in eight years in the first ten months, an almost impossible feat.
[00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.462]  Now the public's even more panicked.
[00:14:13.462 --> 00:14:15.443]  Their savior didn't pan out.
[00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:19.565]  And they figured out in only a few months that this was a scam.
[00:14:19.565 --> 00:14:20.766]  That's the good news.
[00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:24.888]  Previously, it'd take three, four, five, six years for folks to figure out.
[00:14:24.888 --> 00:14:35.273]  It took people five years to figure out that George Bush was a complete criminal and a front man and a puppet and a globalist.
[00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:36.074]  And so now,
[00:14:37.947 --> 00:14:38.328]  We're good to go.
[00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:58.362]  1994 is a backlash against Bill Clinton.
[00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:12.484]  The problem is they will put somebody in there, a CFR globalist, like Newt Gingrich, who will pose as a conservative and will lead the Republican takeover down the globalist rathole.
[00:15:12.484 --> 00:15:23.286]  And then, two years later, the Republicans will be in trouble, and Obama will be in trouble, and so it will be a neck-and-neck race by two different groups of insiders.
[00:15:25.287 --> 00:15:40.420]  That's why we need Ron Paul to be positioned to win the Republican nomination because he's going to be the only Republican who is truly populist, truly constitutional, and has any chance of beating Barack H. Obama.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.344]  If we get Mitt Romney, he's a total globalist stooge, total establishment person.
[00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:48.707]  He will completely sell us out while giving us a bunch of constitutional
[00:15:49.753 --> 00:15:58.936]  Rhetoric, he will go 180 degrees the opposite direction from his rhetoric, just like Obama does.
[00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.797]  It is that simple.
[00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:07.039]  And so Big Brother had a victory in Virginia and New Jersey.
[00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:15.022]  But the actual headline of the Associated Press is GOP sweep Big Brother victories in Virginia and New Jersey.
[00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:24.094]  GOP sweep big governor victories in Virginia and New Jersey.
[00:16:24.094 --> 00:16:26.636]  But you can change that to Big Brother victories.
[00:16:26.636 --> 00:16:32.519]  Because when you look at both these candidates, they are establishment types.
[00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:36.241]  But it does show that it's not taking the people
[00:16:37.651 --> 00:16:37.951]  Yes, sir.
[00:16:52.284 --> 00:17:02.326]  Confirm what we already knew, that Homeland Security and NORTHCOM have been shut up for gun owners, veterans, conservatives, in the Fed, protesters, in the Fed movement people.
[00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:06.087]  Because we are the real threat.
[00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:12.168]  Libertarians, true conservatives, veterans, and gun owners.
[00:17:12.168 --> 00:17:15.029]  People that don't like the Federal Reserve and know it's a corporate
[00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:21.581]  Cartel, that has illegally hijacked our nation, and is bankrupting it by design.
[00:17:21.581 --> 00:17:26.803]  That's even in an incredible article in McClatchy Newspapers.
[00:17:26.803 --> 00:17:38.968]  I just can't get over how incredible this article is, detailing how they imploded the economy by design, how Goldman Sachs did it, to plunge the housing market so they could repossess homes, and so they could run their competition like Bear Stearns out of business.
[00:17:38.968 --> 00:17:44.510]  I mean, it's everything we cover in Fall of the Republic, detailed in mainstream news.
[00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:51.653]  From Goldman Sachs internal documents.
[00:17:51.653 --> 00:18:01.131]  They got internal memorandum and prospectus that they were giving to high-level investors two years before the plunge last fall and winter.
[00:18:03.186 --> 00:18:04.926]  This is three years ago.
[00:18:04.926 --> 00:18:07.387]  These rats were setting this up.
[00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:08.947]  And why not?
[00:18:08.947 --> 00:18:11.408]  They have every major federal regulator.
[00:18:11.408 --> 00:18:14.609]  They're the head of the Security Exchange Commission, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:14.609 --> 00:18:16.869]  The head of the New York Fed, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:20.730]  The current head of the Fed, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.011]  The boss of the White House economic team, Larry Summers, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:25.011 --> 00:18:27.791]  Robert Rubin above him, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:30.172]  Henry Paulson, former head of Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:33.850]  Every stinking one of them.
[00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:45.335]  Mayor Bloomberg, former Goldman Sachs, one of their chief analysts and strategists and designer of the current computer systems they use to rig the market.
[00:18:45.335 --> 00:18:50.658]  Why do you think Bloomberg is so rich and can spend over a billion dollars on his last three campaigns?
[00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:57.069]  Because the guy invented the software they use to swindle the system.
[00:18:57.069 --> 00:19:06.698]  I mean, these people are incredible master criminals that make the Joker of DC Comics look like a choir boy.
[00:19:06.698 --> 00:19:10.882]  And look at them, they've got complete control of our society.
[00:19:10.882 --> 00:19:18.389]  And they've got a military and paramilitary police force ready to take the American people on if we ever try to remove these criminals.
[00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:26.900]  So I'm going to get into GOP's sweet big governor victories in Virginia, New Jersey.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.481]  But Gibbs said that Obama was not watching the returns last night and they didn't care.
[00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:36.463]  You better believe they were watching the returns and they cared.
[00:19:36.463 --> 00:19:39.564]  The Dems are also saying no healthcare bill this year.
[00:19:39.564 --> 00:19:41.885]  That's a way to make you stand down.
[00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:45.766]  Just like Schwarzenegger said, I'm not going to sign that ammo registration.
[00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:49.947]  Bill and I said he will sign it.
[00:19:49.947 --> 00:19:58.732]  Well I'm telling you they got a good chance of passing their government takeover and their cap and trade and all of it and so we better not let them play possum on us.
[00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:05.938]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.220]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.343]  Eat Food Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[00:20:12.343 --> 00:20:19.047]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:20:19.047 --> 00:20:22.930]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.873]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[00:20:27.273 --> 00:20:29.534]  Neutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct.

[00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:02.744]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.744 --> 00:21:03.604]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.604 --> 00:21:03.925]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:08.967]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:10.608]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.608 --> 00:21:11.348]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.348 --> 00:21:12.849]  Yeah, Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:15.830]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.692]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:22.493]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:25.454]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.454 --> 00:21:27.034]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.034 --> 00:21:27.334]  Right!

[00:21:30.635 --> 00:21:31.216]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.216 --> 00:21:32.576]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.576 --> 00:21:36.437]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.437 --> 00:21:40.218]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:01.124 --> 00:22:03.165]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.165 --> 00:22:06.127]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:22:06.127 --> 00:22:08.668]  Certainly not in my 17 years in the industry.
[00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:11.089]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[00:22:11.089 --> 00:22:14.251]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:16.692]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[00:22:16.692 --> 00:22:17.772]  Who pays for that?
[00:22:17.772 --> 00:22:18.973]  Is your money safe?
[00:22:18.973 --> 00:22:23.035]  The dollar has lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:26.377]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:22:26.377 --> 00:22:27.657]  Ours is not immune.
[00:22:27.657 --> 00:22:29.838]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:22:29.838 --> 00:22:30.879]  Anything tied to the dollar
[00:22:32.717 --> 00:22:33.938]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:22:33.938 --> 00:22:35.880]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.741]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:37.722]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:23:00.552 --> 00:23:03.173]  Worried that inflation will destroy your savings?
[00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:04.334]  Grab a pencil.
[00:23:04.334 --> 00:23:13.359]  I'll tell you how to turn $10,000 into potentially $431,000 in 12 to 18 months, thanks to Obama.
[00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:15.900]  And this isn't about gold bullion or coins.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.641]  It's about gold stocks.
[00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:19.102]  They have soared over 800% since the year 2000.
[00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:30.268]  This is with gold being less than $1,000, a figure that should go to between $1,500 and $2,500 according to Merrill Lynch and UBS.
[00:23:30.268 --> 00:23:41.493]  Even better, wait till you hear what Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter says in his free Investing in Gold kit.
[00:23:41.493 --> 00:23:46.976]  It highlights seven must-own stocks, including a stock with six-figure potential whose price
[00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:53.831]  The good news here is that the global elite have shown their hand big time.
[00:24:17.312 --> 00:24:19.873]  They've gotten behind schedule.
[00:24:19.873 --> 00:24:25.075]  Mounting resistance to globalization is intensifying on a planetary scale.
[00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:36.619]  So they've decided to bum rushes, to move with all their assets at once, to try to pass their takeover of healthcare, their global carbon tax, their banking takeover, their federalization takeover.
[00:24:37.571 --> 00:24:42.395]  Their police state takeover, their takeover of the schools, everything is happening now.
[00:24:42.395 --> 00:24:43.856]  Their takeover of the internet.
[00:24:43.856 --> 00:24:55.725]  Mainstream news again today that Obama, Northcom, and the NSA are taking over the internet right now to shut it down.
[00:24:55.725 --> 00:25:01.529]  Unspeakably horrible things are happening, but what do you expect living inside the New World Order?
[00:25:01.529 --> 00:25:06.113]  The good news is all the denial is over, and patriots
[00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:14.760]  Did their due diligence for decades, reading the Globalist documents, exposing their architecture, their blueprints.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:21.923]  People laughed at us, they wouldn't look at the documents, but they heard us in detail tell them the future.
[00:25:21.923 --> 00:25:26.464]  And so now, they're not saying, oh, great job, you guys did the research.
[00:25:26.464 --> 00:25:28.565]  No, a lot of people are saying, you're psychic!
[00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:30.125]  How did you people know all this?
[00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:31.086]  You're incredible!
[00:25:31.977 --> 00:25:35.138]  It's like the general public are ignorant savages or something.
[00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:44.161]  They think because we know how to make a fire or know how to, you know, have gunpowder that we're magical.
[00:25:44.161 --> 00:25:58.106]  No, we read the Club of Rome, Trilateral Commission, CFR documents, we read the UN documents, we read books written by former British prime ministers and German chancellors and US presidents and David Rockefeller.
[00:25:58.106 --> 00:26:00.047]  They write books bragging!
[00:26:01.247 --> 00:26:14.290]  Thousands of white papers out of universities and think tanks bragging how they would forcibly drug us, how they would put cancer viruses in the vaccines to soft kill us, how they would poison the water to sterilize us and dumb us down.
[00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:21.351]  And all we've done is go, gee, Jiminy Cricket!
[00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:24.152]  We'd better research all of this.
[00:26:24.152 --> 00:26:27.933]  And I tend to get really mad and really upset and not get depressed.
[00:26:27.933 --> 00:26:29.313]  I don't get depressed, I get angry.
[00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:57.497]  When I see open world government being announced and not enough people waking up fast enough, but people are waking up at record levels and if the Congress can't get its global carbon tax bill through, its global banking takeover through, its healthcare takeover through in this Congress, it is going to be many times harder next year, probably impossible unless they stage a false flag terror attack.
[00:26:57.497 --> 00:27:00.218]  And so I want to apologize to listeners for
[00:27:02.472 --> 00:27:06.093]  Yelling and screaming sometimes and calling them SOBs.
[00:27:06.093 --> 00:27:07.274]  I'm not going to do that anymore.
[00:27:07.274 --> 00:27:08.874]  I'm making the commitment.
[00:27:08.874 --> 00:27:18.978]  I haven't done that in years and I've been getting out of control lately because the country is going down and I genuinely... I don't get depressed.
[00:27:18.978 --> 00:27:21.139]  I get this nasty feeling.
[00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:28.682]  I just get so angry and then I'm brooding when I'm at home and I'm brooding when I'm at work and so I apologize to everybody for having to be around it.
[00:27:29.798 --> 00:27:41.743]  I need to be cheerful and happy and just trust in our Heavenly Father, the Maker, to lead us and guide us through all of these perilous times.
[00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:45.744]  It's just, it's hard to deal with the death of the dollar.
[00:27:45.744 --> 00:27:50.186]  It's hard to deal with that knowing what it's going to mean to my family and my country.
[00:27:51.243 --> 00:28:02.889]  I mean, I know who these people are, and it's just outrageous to have to see them continue to stay in power, to see their agenda just to continue to expand, and for all of their crimes to intensify.
[00:28:02.889 --> 00:28:11.694]  But I have to understand, I can't move the world by myself, and we're not going to win in a day, we're not going to win in a week, we're not going to win in a month, a year, or even a decade.
[00:28:11.694 --> 00:28:18.338]  But the battle is now joined, the awakening is happening, and the momentum is swinging against the enemy.
[00:28:19.568 --> 00:28:34.299]  We've struck some serious blows against them, so they're really firing up, turning everything loose on us, trying to knock us out, trying to KO us right now.
[00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:35.420]  There's no TKO.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.283]  There's no technical knockout here.
[00:28:39.283 --> 00:28:41.865]  They've got to have a complete knockout, and it's not going to happen.
[00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:48.718]  And the fighting spirit has been awakened in the people, not just in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:28:48.718 --> 00:28:58.704]  And all of our, quote, conspiracy theories have now been confirmed for everyone.
[00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:04.307]  And so the system is panicking.
[00:29:04.307 --> 00:29:06.728]  The system is in free fall.
[00:29:06.728 --> 00:29:12.292]  That's why you see them trying to assert themselves boldly and in everyone's face right now.
[00:29:13.248 --> 00:29:23.811]  And so it is great news that Republicans won in Virginia and New Jersey in these off-year elections.
[00:29:23.811 --> 00:29:27.252]  Great news showing the people want change.
[00:29:27.252 --> 00:29:29.012]  Don't expect anything out of these governors.
[00:29:29.012 --> 00:29:30.152]  They're part of the same establishment.
[00:29:30.152 --> 00:29:36.014]  But it signifies a rebuke against everything Obama's done.
[00:29:36.014 --> 00:29:41.095]  And it lets members of the Democratic Congress engaging in all this treason know they're out of there.
[00:29:41.764 --> 00:29:42.765]  In a year and a half.
[00:29:42.765 --> 00:29:50.909]  But, we've got to let Republicans know that we're going to go after them as well if they're not patriots.
[00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:52.309]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:54.850]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.512]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:05.565]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:10.090]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.373]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:13.995]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:15.036]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.256 --> 00:30:23.681]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:31:07.111 --> 00:31:08.391]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:33:05.765 --> 00:33:07.346]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:07.346 --> 00:33:17.831]  We have Major General Stubblebine and his wife, Medical Doctor Rima Labo, joining us in the third and fourth hour today on the flu, the eugenics agenda, the GMO food, all of it.
[00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:21.352]  We're gonna have open phones when they join us.
[00:33:21.352 --> 00:33:23.813]  I'm gonna open the phones up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:23.813 --> 00:33:23.873]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:34.743]  Alright, let me just read to you some of the headlines.
[00:33:34.743 --> 00:33:36.086]  I got stuck for 30 minutes.
[00:33:37.984 --> 00:33:45.869]  On the fact that Republicans all across the country, not just in these governor races, but in local races, swept everywhere.
[00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:47.791]  Just like Democrats swept.
[00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:51.633]  The public isn't very sophisticated, but they know they don't like the government they've got.
[00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:53.274]  So, get rid of all the Republicans.
[00:33:53.274 --> 00:33:54.195]  Bush was bad.
[00:33:54.195 --> 00:33:55.616]  Oh my gosh, Obama's even worse.
[00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:57.037]  Get rid of all the Democrats.
[00:33:57.037 --> 00:33:59.498]  And then, oh my gosh, the Republicans are traitors as well.
[00:33:59.498 --> 00:34:00.739]  Get rid of them.
[00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:06.523]  But it's not taking three, four, five, six years for people to go through these realignments now and these cycles.
[00:34:06.523 --> 00:34:07.504]  It's taken a few months.
[00:34:08.689 --> 00:34:10.613]  It's over for the establishment.
[00:34:10.613 --> 00:34:13.017]  The media keeps going, look at Republicans, they're weak.
[00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:16.764]  They've only got a 25% approval rating for Congress.
[00:34:16.764 --> 00:34:17.505]  Uh, yeah?
[00:34:18.453 --> 00:34:21.656]  And the Democrats have an 11 or 12.
[00:34:21.656 --> 00:34:23.358]  But see, that's a media spin.
[00:34:23.358 --> 00:34:28.222]  Well, we don't think Republicans are going to win these governor seats in New Jersey and Virginia.
[00:34:28.222 --> 00:34:31.505]  Because, uh, look at the Republicans' congressional number.
[00:34:31.505 --> 00:34:33.467]  It's 25 points!
[00:34:33.467 --> 00:34:34.908]  Man, that's low!
[00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:35.809]  Uh, yeah.
[00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:38.892]  And it's 11 or 12, depending on the poll for the Democrats.
[00:34:39.927 --> 00:34:41.528]  Exactly.
[00:34:41.528 --> 00:34:44.050]  People are really starting to figure it out.
[00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.094]  And so the media tries to create this massive fog of lies.
[00:34:48.094 --> 00:34:59.823]  Every national radio show, every major editorial I see, whether it's Republican or Democrats writing it, every major television program on news I watch is, Republicans better watch it.
[00:34:59.823 --> 00:35:01.485]  They're getting too extreme.
[00:35:01.485 --> 00:35:05.008]  They need to be mainline, middle of the road and work with Obama.
[00:35:05.008 --> 00:35:07.330]  They're going to lose even more seats if they don't.
[00:35:08.217 --> 00:35:23.727]  No, if the Republicans go along with open borders and tripling of government again and all these wars and all this corruption, they're going to lose just like the Democrats.
[00:35:23.727 --> 00:35:26.929]  Republicans need to become constitutionalists.
[00:35:26.929 --> 00:35:29.191]  If Democrats became constitutionalists, they would win.
[00:35:30.452 --> 00:35:36.075]  Grayson out of Florida has one of the highest approval ratings of any Democrat in Congress.
[00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:37.076]  Why?
[00:35:37.076 --> 00:35:45.381]  Because he is at least anti-establishment to the point that he calls the Federal Reserve criminal and calls the head Enron lawyer for the Federal Reserve a whore.
[00:35:45.381 --> 00:35:47.022]  People love it!
[00:35:47.022 --> 00:35:53.526]  So the media demonizes him because they're scared of that mindset catching hold.
[00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:54.867]  People love Ron Paul.
[00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:57.228]  His approval ratings in most polls are above 70%.
[00:35:57.228 --> 00:35:58.649]  It's even higher in Texas.
[00:36:01.052 --> 00:36:08.514]  He won his last congressional race by a record landslide of right at 70%.
[00:36:08.514 --> 00:36:09.615]  And who's running against him?
[00:36:09.615 --> 00:36:12.116]  The mainline Republican neocons.
[00:36:12.116 --> 00:36:14.336]  There's not even a Democratic challenger.
[00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:20.238]  His challenge is from the Republican traitors.
[00:36:20.238 --> 00:36:20.958]  RINOs.
[00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:22.379]  Republican in name only.
[00:36:24.304 --> 00:36:29.946]  So, you need to let the Democrats know, you are going to vote against them.
[00:36:29.946 --> 00:36:37.489]  Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, that traitor in the Senate, pushing through the climate bill, the total takeover of our society.
[00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:40.350]  That guy needs to have a recall done on him right now.
[00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:49.113]  I'll guarantee you, if Senator Lindsey Graham's constituents, if a thousand of you, because every phone call signifies a thousand constituents, every letter signifies 10,000,
[00:36:52.248 --> 00:37:01.331]  If you would call him and say, we're launching a recall of Lindsey Graham, and don't let him play that game of, oh, well, if you get rid of me, you'll get something worse.
[00:37:01.331 --> 00:37:02.311]  We don't care.
[00:37:02.311 --> 00:37:06.292]  The point is, we're going to punish you, and then we'll recall the next guy.
[00:37:06.292 --> 00:37:08.733]  We've got to get aggressive with these people.
[00:37:10.506 --> 00:37:16.988]  They wouldn't have been able to pass this thing into committee and mark it up to go to the full Senate if it wasn't for Lindsey Graham.
[00:37:16.988 --> 00:37:20.908]  And these disgusting globalists thank him and praise him all over the news.
[00:37:20.908 --> 00:37:26.470]  Ban Ki-moon, in that week-and-a-half-ago editorial in the New York Times called, we can do it.
[00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.370]  Just as stupid as, yes, we can.
[00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.331]  Bob the Builder, la la la.
[00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:32.771]  In fact, go to YouTube, guys.
[00:37:32.771 --> 00:37:35.152]  Craig, will you go pull up Bob the Builder?
[00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:36.412]  I want to play that later.
[00:37:36.412 --> 00:37:39.493]  And show people how a children's cartoon is where they got this
[00:37:40.376 --> 00:37:43.617]  Yes, we can, mindless chant from.
[00:37:43.617 --> 00:37:46.658]  And Bankai Moon, we can do it!
[00:37:46.658 --> 00:37:50.219]  Yay!
[00:37:50.219 --> 00:37:51.479]  We can do it.
[00:37:51.479 --> 00:37:57.261]  We can bring you to justice.
[00:37:57.261 --> 00:38:01.542]  Okay, see, I said I was in each other news and I went off into another rant about that.
[00:38:01.542 --> 00:38:03.543]  It's these people are unpopular.
[00:38:03.543 --> 00:38:04.823]  They're criminal.
[00:38:04.823 --> 00:38:06.224]  What they're doing is illegal.
[00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:10.499]  The military and police are waking up.
[00:38:10.499 --> 00:38:18.505]  I cannot tell you how many military and police send us information, how many police and military stop me on the street and say that they support what we're doing.
[00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:27.492]  I can't tell you how many other talk show hosts I've talked to where they have police coming up to their radio stations thanking them for speaking out against the New World Order.
[00:38:27.492 --> 00:38:32.035]  Oh, the police have bad commanders in almost every case because they're federalized.
[00:38:32.035 --> 00:38:33.677]  They just didn't get the memo yet.
[00:38:33.677 --> 00:38:34.818]  But the average cop
[00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:37.633]  is waking up.
[00:38:37.633 --> 00:38:57.032]  Now, sure, we get videos every day of cops tasering old people for no reason, of bad police who are trigger-happy, beating up old women, shooting people in the back, and then the commanders support them and they don't get in trouble, thus demonizing police more, which is what the system wants, so it's an us-against-them mentality.
[00:38:57.032 --> 00:38:59.374]  And I only figured out this trick in the last few years.
[00:38:59.374 --> 00:39:00.195]  I used to fall for it.
[00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:07.814]  And I still speak out against bad cops and corruption, but I'm beginning to understand the more sophisticated nuances of these people's tricks.
[00:39:07.814 --> 00:39:09.414]  And the more I learn, the more I understand.
[00:39:09.414 --> 00:39:12.175]  It's just all opening up to me.
[00:39:12.175 --> 00:39:18.056]  Everybody, the more wisdom you get, the more you learn you don't understand.
[00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:20.937]  And the more you realize how completely blind the public is.
[00:39:25.128 --> 00:39:30.233]  But if they would just punish bad cops, then the police wouldn't be thugs, but they promote the thugs.
[00:39:30.233 --> 00:39:41.845]  And by the way, coming up, the minor newspaper reports 81-year-old tasered by Ellison Air Force Base police outside the base.
[00:39:41.845 --> 00:39:43.947]  Posse Comitatus is truly dead.
[00:39:43.947 --> 00:39:48.272]  And every few days I see reports of military arresting US citizens off base.
[00:39:49.721 --> 00:40:07.807]  And there's this incredible taser video out of Minneapolis, where the guy gets out of the car, puts his hands on the squad car, and the cop walks up like he's not going to do anything, and then gets behind him premeditatedly, and tasers him in the neck, and then gets him on the ground at point-blank range, tasering him with pleasure.
[00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:09.267]  And it's just like deer hunters.
[00:40:09.267 --> 00:40:15.109]  There's a lot of people I've been deer hunting with over the years, at different hunts I've been on back when I had time,
[00:40:16.377 --> 00:40:27.001]  And there's always this guy that's got 20 fancy rifles in the back of their truck, and they've got every gadget and everything in the world, but they can't hit the side of a barn if they tried.
[00:40:27.001 --> 00:40:35.024]  And every time a big buck or big elk or big muley comes out, or they see it in the woods, they can't wait until it comes out to the edge of the clearing.
[00:40:35.024 --> 00:40:36.085]  They just start blasting.
[00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:38.942]  Buck fever.
[00:40:38.942 --> 00:40:41.383]  And I've seen the videos of these cops.
[00:40:41.383 --> 00:40:43.064]  They just want to shoot somebody.
[00:40:43.064 --> 00:40:44.364]  They want to taser somebody.
[00:40:44.364 --> 00:40:45.545]  They're dangerous.
[00:40:45.545 --> 00:40:48.867]  They need to be off the force now.
[00:40:48.867 --> 00:40:50.948]  They're nuts!
[00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:51.948]  They're nuts!
[00:40:51.948 --> 00:40:53.970]  And they shouldn't be deer hunting.
[00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:58.492]  These are the type of people that go out to national parks and shoot little kids and people.
[00:40:58.492 --> 00:41:00.593]  And shoot cows.
[00:41:00.593 --> 00:41:03.575]  Every county in Texas, I read reports every year, where people
[00:41:04.594 --> 00:41:09.118]  Or hunting on somebody's land and shoot somebody's Brahma bull over the next fence.
[00:41:09.118 --> 00:41:14.142]  They can't tell a giant gray bull from a buck!
[00:41:14.142 --> 00:41:15.924]  Because they want to shoot something!
[00:41:15.924 --> 00:41:18.106]  Alright, alright.
[00:41:18.106 --> 00:41:19.607]  I'm ranting.
[00:41:19.607 --> 00:41:23.150]  I just watch these cops and these guys have no business in uniform.
[00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:25.437]  No business.
[00:41:25.437 --> 00:41:28.639]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:34.024]  You know, they've covered up the video cams of the black guy they shot to death in Austin.
[00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:35.886]  And we all know they have the videotapes.
[00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:38.268]  That's a lie, that they don't have them.
[00:41:38.268 --> 00:41:40.269]  That the both squad cars weren't rolling.
[00:41:40.269 --> 00:41:48.336]  But the audio's been released of these guys screaming and yelling as one guy's dying.
[00:41:48.336 --> 00:41:51.239]  And every few months an Austin cop shoots somebody in the back.
[00:41:54.358 --> 00:42:05.322]  And how many times have citizens videotaped police shooting somebody in handcuffs on the ground, and then the police lie and plant a gun on them and say, oh, they tried to shoot me.
[00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:10.504]  They shot this libertarian 9-11 truther, and now there's multiple witnesses that came forward and said no.
[00:42:10.504 --> 00:42:16.826]  He got out of the car, they tasered him, he pulled the tasers out, got on his knees, and the cops shot him twice.
[00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:19.767]  And of course the cops lied and said he pulled a gun and all this.
[00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:22.908]  You know, you guys are really discrediting yourselves.
[00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:41.069]  You trigger happy morons who play Call of Duty and Doom when you're home at night in your apartment and you think a zombie popped up in front of you when it was just some pathetic citizen you just double-capped.
[00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:43.710]  You need to be brought to justice for all the stuff you're doing to us!
[00:42:45.273 --> 00:42:46.653]  You understand?
[00:42:46.653 --> 00:42:48.694]  I'm tired of it and the people are tired of it.
[00:42:48.694 --> 00:42:52.975]  All right, now I've gone into a police rant.
[00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:53.496]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:42:53.496 --> 00:42:55.856]  This is the type of news I have in my stack.
[00:42:55.856 --> 00:43:01.018]  Al Gore's inconvenient truth sequel stresses spiritual argument on climate.
[00:43:01.018 --> 00:43:05.239]  They aren't shifting to a spiritual argument because the science is disproving them.
[00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:10.601]  By the way, Al Gore's now come out and admitted that most of the CO2 isn't man-made and that maybe that's not what's happening.
[00:43:11.325 --> 00:43:17.350]  But he says, spiritually, we have to cut greenhouse gases.
[00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.473]  Well, Maury Strong and all these people are complete occultists.
[00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:23.475]  They want a one-world Gaia religion.
[00:43:23.475 --> 00:43:26.477]  That's what we cover in Fall of the Republic.
[00:43:26.477 --> 00:43:29.079]  Of course it's a new religion.
[00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:31.622]  These people aren't anti-religion.
[00:43:31.622 --> 00:43:33.663]  They're just against established religions.
[00:43:33.663 --> 00:43:35.285]  They want their old-time religion.
[00:43:35.987 --> 00:43:36.788]  To be in control.
[00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:38.470]  They are deep occultists.
[00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:45.240]  And they also understand, as scientific technicians of society, that people love religion.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.086]  And this is an anti-human, anti-industrial religion.
[00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:51.068]  So that's now admitted.
[00:43:53.698 --> 00:43:53.979]  U.N.
[00:43:53.979 --> 00:44:01.508]  Undersecretary General calls for increase in pledged funding for climate change for more than $100 billion from each of the industrialized nations.
[00:44:01.508 --> 00:44:06.435]  Another big Prison Planet article, Al Gore admits CO2 does not cause majority of global warming.
[00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:07.075]  Well, yeah, the U.N.'
[00:44:07.055 --> 00:44:11.902]  's own report says 3 to 6 percent, depending on which report you look at, of CO2 is man-made.
[00:44:14.147 --> 00:44:16.669]  And of that three to six percent, it's precious.
[00:44:16.669 --> 00:44:18.410]  The plants just gobble it up.
[00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:24.794]  All the ice core samples show conclusively that we're in a carbon dioxide and oxygen starved environment.
[00:44:24.794 --> 00:44:26.596]  The planet goes through these cycles.
[00:44:26.596 --> 00:44:29.458]  We have low oxygen and low carbon dioxide.
[00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:32.880]  And oxygen and carbon dioxide are not poisonous.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.581]  They are good!
[00:44:34.581 --> 00:44:38.604]  It is not a conspiracy theory that plants breathe.
[00:44:38.604 --> 00:44:39.364]  They absorb
[00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:41.306]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:42.866]  It is their life-giving gas.
[00:44:42.866 --> 00:44:48.309]  It's what they use in their bodies.
[00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:51.371]  We use oxygen bound to red blood cells.
[00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:54.452]  They use carbon dioxide bound to their cells.
[00:44:54.452 --> 00:44:58.314]  It's their blood.
[00:44:58.314 --> 00:45:02.717]  It is not a conspiracy theory like... They actually say that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:45:02.717 --> 00:45:09.180]  They have a Wikipedia page called the... The... Dihydrogen Monoxide Conspiracy Theory.
[00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:32.074]  And they say, oh, there's a conspiracy theory that people make the point that carbon dioxide isn't deadly, but just like most people will call for banning dihydrogen monoxide, and then the conspiracy theorists make the point that that shows the public's ignorance of these gases and of water.
[00:45:32.074 --> 00:45:33.835]  What is the conspiracy theory?
[00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:35.875]  That's like telling Galileo, who says that
[00:45:37.352 --> 00:45:40.875]  The Earth is not the center of the universe is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:45:40.875 --> 00:45:42.156]  I mean, it's just nonsensical.
[00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:46.500]  You go, hey, Al Gore, you're making money off of the climate bills.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.721]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:45:47.721 --> 00:45:48.982]  Do you believe in moon landings?
[00:45:48.982 --> 00:45:50.523]  That's his canned answer.
[00:45:50.523 --> 00:45:53.345]  He said it again on TV yesterday.
[00:45:53.345 --> 00:45:56.588]  You're like, no, you're part of these companies making money off it.
[00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:57.749]  Oh, you believe it didn't land on the moon.
[00:45:57.749 --> 00:45:59.230]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:05.115]  Hey, people say ban water because they don't understand the scientific term and it sounds scary to hydrogen monoxide.
[00:46:05.115 --> 00:46:06.256]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:46:07.788 --> 00:46:14.253]  Wikipedia says it's a conspiracy theory that there's a global government forming calling itself the New World Order.
[00:46:14.253 --> 00:46:20.158]  I guess they didn't know that in one week, a month and a half ago, there were 12,000 plus mainstream news articles calling for world government.
[00:46:20.158 --> 00:46:22.000]  See, this is the game.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.724]  They think you're so stupid!
[00:46:26.724 --> 00:46:34.090]  They think you're so dumb that they can just sit there and tell you that carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.651]  They've now listed it as a toxin.
[00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:40.385]  As a pollutant.
[00:46:40.385 --> 00:46:46.068]  They think you're so stupid, they tell you there's not a world government, as it's openly been unveiled in the last year.
[00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:58.295]  They think you're so stupid that you can't read the vaccine insert that says mercury's in there and it can cause neurological disorders and sterilization and infertility and autoimmune disorders.
[00:46:58.295 --> 00:47:01.617]  They think you're dumb, are you?
[00:47:01.617 --> 00:47:06.420]  If you were smart, we'd take this country back and arrest these people and this could all be over very quickly.
[00:47:07.301 --> 00:47:13.826]  But we've been taught it's cutesy and fun to not stand up to government corruption because they've taught us that that doesn't exist.
[00:47:13.826 --> 00:47:17.128]  Anytime you criticize the government, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:47:17.128 --> 00:47:26.015]  I went to the Smart Growth Conference in 2000... No, in 1999 in Austin.
[00:47:26.015 --> 00:47:28.396]  And they openly admitted they were going to steal all the property in Austin.
[00:47:28.396 --> 00:47:30.618]  It was all a big business and we're laughing about it on stage.
[00:47:30.618 --> 00:47:34.561]  And then I came back and showed people the video and they emailed me and called me saying it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:47:38.129 --> 00:47:42.453]  I'm told it's a conspiracy theory that they're building four sewage treatment plants on Lake Travis.
[00:47:42.453 --> 00:47:48.678]  Doesn't matter, it's admitted, the public's trained to live in denial, and they say, not true, I'm not going to do anything about it.
[00:47:48.678 --> 00:47:51.660]  I want to swim in sewage.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:58.626]  People are trained to shuffle off and throw off any type of responsibility.
[00:48:01.934 --> 00:48:07.376]  Okay, in this segment and the next, and I'm going to calls and news for the entire next hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:48:07.376 --> 00:48:24.823]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up today, briefly, because gold has gone over $1,093 an ounce today, and Ted is running out of the gold that he bought at the 920 level.
[00:48:24.823 --> 00:48:27.524]  In fact, he was telling me this morning, he has one coin group left.
[00:48:28.393 --> 00:48:28.553]  That's
[00:48:48.649 --> 00:48:51.672]  They're heading up towards that major psychological barrier of $1,100.
[00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:53.794]  Ted Anderson?
[00:48:53.794 --> 00:48:55.916]  Yeah, I'm right here with you, Alex, and that's true.
[00:48:55.916 --> 00:49:00.741]  I mean, currently right now we're at $1,000 and $1,093.40.
[00:49:00.741 --> 00:49:03.184]  We've seen a high today of $1,096.
[00:49:03.184 --> 00:49:10.471]  And if you think about that for just a minute, all we have to do is see a $4 increase in gold and we've hit $1,100 an ounce.
[00:49:12.313 --> 00:49:13.314]  That's going to happen.
[00:49:13.314 --> 00:49:18.116]  I'm 100% convinced of it.
[00:49:18.116 --> 00:49:19.657]  I'm not saying it will happen today.
[00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:21.958]  It could happen tomorrow, but it's going to happen.
[00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:24.179]  We're going to blow through that.
[00:49:24.179 --> 00:49:25.620]  And we know why this is happening.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.222]  The third largest bank, Citibank, declares bankruptcy.
[00:49:28.222 --> 00:49:29.482]  It's hardly on the news.
[00:49:29.482 --> 00:49:31.984]  The dollar plunged to a record low today.
[00:49:31.984 --> 00:49:35.446]  The yuppies are running around worried about the World Series and sucking their thumbs.
[00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:38.066]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:49:38.066 --> 00:49:42.548]  But you do see more people getting involved in the gold and silver market.
[00:49:42.548 --> 00:49:55.091]  I've been running some ads for the Creature from Jekyll Island on some, of all things, oldies music, and these people are interested in learning about the Federal Reserve System, which I find just amazing.
[00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:58.752]  By the way, Ted, I'm going to get that ad cut for you for Fall of the Republic.
[00:49:59.542 --> 00:50:01.623]  Oh, yeah, that'll be definite.
[00:50:01.623 --> 00:50:10.046]  I want to get that out as soon as we can in some of these mainstream radio shows, because people are hungry.
[00:50:10.046 --> 00:50:10.986]  They want answers.
[00:50:10.986 --> 00:50:12.766]  They want to know what's going on.
[00:50:12.766 --> 00:50:16.368]  And your videos, there's nothing better than that.
[00:50:16.368 --> 00:50:22.430]  I mean, those videos really put the finger right on the point, and very understandable.
[00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.971]  And I just need to say that my hat's off to you.
[00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:29.012]  I just remember when you did Please State, and it was you sitting in front of a video camera,
[00:50:29.432 --> 00:50:31.533]  And you have come so far with those videos.
[00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:37.057]  I'm just completely impressed, and I have to say, proud to be able to work with you for as long as we have.
[00:50:37.057 --> 00:50:40.238]  Well, proud to be able to work with you now, Ted, for more than 12 years.
[00:50:40.238 --> 00:50:46.942]  When we come back, tell folks about the gold and silver offer today and where you see the economy going.
[00:50:46.942 --> 00:50:56.028]  My friends, we are being fully economically decimated so that the economy can be vertically integrated.
[00:50:56.028 --> 00:50:58.369]  So it can be sucked up by these banking criminals.
[00:51:01.246 --> 00:51:06.891]  You've heard the Get The Tea commercials, and many people like our commercials, but I did notice something.
[00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:08.353]  What the heck is a toxin?
[00:51:08.353 --> 00:51:09.233]  So, here it is.
[00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:15.880]  A toxin is a poisonous substance that is capable of causing disease when introduced into the body.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.722]  Formaldehyde, from seat cushions and particle board.
[00:51:18.722 --> 00:51:25.869]  How about carbon monoxide, furnace-burning propane, butane, disinfectants, perfume,
[00:51:26.443 --> 00:51:27.405]  Mouthwash?
[00:51:27.405 --> 00:51:28.326]  Glues?
[00:51:28.326 --> 00:51:29.188]  Air fresheners?
[00:51:29.188 --> 00:51:30.029]  Pesticides?
[00:51:30.029 --> 00:51:33.394]  Oh my gosh, even sugar is a toxin according to Dr. Lau.
[00:51:33.394 --> 00:51:35.257]  It's a very addictive drug.
[00:51:35.257 --> 00:51:36.800]  It's time to fight back!
[00:51:37.486 --> 00:51:40.028]  GetTheTee.com.
[00:51:40.028 --> 00:51:41.949]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[00:51:41.949 --> 00:51:44.271]  Or you can get your trusty cell phone out and call us at 928-308-0408.
[00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:44.811]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:47.133]  And put in your order today.
[00:51:47.133 --> 00:51:50.456]  Lose weight, feel good, and be free of all these toxins.
[00:51:50.456 --> 00:51:51.136]  GetTheTee.com.
[00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:06.568]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.568 --> 00:52:09.813]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.813 --> 00:52:11.236]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.603]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.603 --> 00:52:21.009]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.009 --> 00:52:26.554]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.554 --> 00:52:36.183]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.283 --> 00:52:38.625]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:40.226]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.226 --> 00:52:42.688]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.688 --> 00:52:44.809]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:49.953]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.953 --> 00:52:59.080]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:04.315 --> 00:53:07.538]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[00:53:07.538 --> 00:53:10.720]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.683]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[00:53:13.683 --> 00:53:20.128]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[00:53:20.128 --> 00:53:23.671]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[00:53:23.671 --> 00:53:25.452]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[00:53:25.885 --> 00:53:30.172]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[00:53:30.172 --> 00:53:38.906]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years, while our competition charges $3,000.
[00:53:40.578 --> 00:53:47.000]  We ship to you 135 pounds of great bulk food supplies for a fraction of that.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.041]  Our company is owned by a famous patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.321]  I know you can trust him.
[00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:53.722]  He's my dad.
[00:53:53.722 --> 00:53:57.283]  Patriotfood.com is the wise choice for food insurance.
[00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:09.031]  It's all happening according to the globalist plan.
[00:54:09.031 --> 00:54:12.353]  The destruction of every sovereign nation-state on Earth.
[00:54:12.353 --> 00:54:19.657]  They've sucked up the resources, the manpower, the ingenuity, the smarts of the American people to build their world government.
[00:54:19.657 --> 00:54:22.959]  Now they're tanking the Republic into the dustbin of history.
[00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:29.263]  But they bargained for the people to rise against them, but not at anywhere near this level.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:43.391]  The people are rising to the challenge to save the Republic, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, to identify the enemies of this country that have destroyed the dollar.
[00:54:43.391 --> 00:54:52.859]  I salute all of you and your long, tireless fight as you have battled tooth and nail against the globalists.
[00:54:52.859 --> 00:54:55.041]  Because of you, we've got a fighting chance.
[00:54:57.196 --> 00:55:03.942]  Going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, tell folks about today's gold offer that, well, isn't going to last long.
[00:55:03.942 --> 00:55:06.384]  In fact, one of the gold offers you had yesterday is now sold out.
[00:55:06.384 --> 00:55:09.486]  What do you have left from the market when you bought in at the 920 level?
[00:55:10.526 --> 00:55:16.189]  Yeah, well, gold from $9.20 obviously has gone up a tremendous amount.
[00:55:16.189 --> 00:55:22.273]  I mean, the last time I was on the air with you, or last week, gold's gone up $40 an ounce.
[00:55:22.273 --> 00:55:24.394]  I have the francs, they went up just a little bit.
[00:55:24.394 --> 00:55:25.215]  They went from $236 to $238.
[00:55:25.215 --> 00:55:25.615]  Still,
[00:55:31.517 --> 00:55:33.059]  That's just a steal.
[00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:36.002]  The British Sovereign currently right now is at $2.93.
[00:55:36.002 --> 00:55:38.345]  That coins up $3.
[00:55:38.345 --> 00:55:42.710]  Presently, right now, the Walking Liberty halves are still at the older price, low price of $8.69 apiece.
[00:55:44.437 --> 00:55:50.721]  The Lakota coin, $22.30, doesn't even reflect the fact that silver's gone up.
[00:55:50.721 --> 00:55:54.643]  The coin, the $10 Liberty right now, is at $818.50.
[00:55:54.643 --> 00:56:01.267]  That coin is priced based upon gold being back down at that $920 an ounce level.
[00:56:01.267 --> 00:56:08.432]  Just right now, I can tell you, I've got a wide variety of different items here, and the market is so hot.
[00:56:08.892 --> 00:56:22.115]  And the quantities of what's being sold, not only by Midas, but all the rest of the gold and silver dealers in the United States, there just isn't enough physical supply to meet the demand right now, and premiums are going to start rising again.
[00:56:22.115 --> 00:56:31.658]  And for people that want to get involved in gold and silver, I would suggest that you do it now, rather than wait until more crises come along, and these prices go up even further.
[00:56:31.658 --> 00:56:34.219]  I mean, we're just sitting right on the verge of going to $1,100 an ounce.
[00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:44.904]  And really, the next level to see after that is the $1,300 level that Bloomberg's talking about, and then who knows, $2,600 from there?
[00:56:44.904 --> 00:56:48.046]  I just can't tell you enough.
[00:56:48.046 --> 00:56:50.448]  Our fiat paper system is in trouble.
[00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:54.150]  We have a lot of people in other nations trying to get away from the U.S.
[00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.450]  dollar.
[00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:56.412]  Because they know it's in trouble.
[00:56:56.412 --> 00:57:07.668]  They can see the handwriting on the wall and for some reason there's still some yuppies here in the United States that thinks that we're going to have this recovery miraculously and everything's going to be great again.
[00:57:07.668 --> 00:57:08.830]  It's just not going to happen.
[00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:24.704]  Oh, well, they're telling us the economy's great because private banks are making record profits and consolidating their industry, but manufacturing, joblessness, inflation starting to tick up, it's all there.
[00:57:24.704 --> 00:57:25.926]  We wish this wasn't the case.
[00:57:25.926 --> 00:57:27.828]  We wish the dollar wasn't at a record low today.
[00:57:28.368 --> 00:57:30.189]  Folks, give Modest Resources a call.
[00:57:30.189 --> 00:57:32.169]  Ted, how long can you hold these prices?
[00:57:32.169 --> 00:57:35.490]  Well, I'm going to be holding these prices until midnight tonight.
[00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.491]  And I just, it's too hard to tell.
[00:57:37.491 --> 00:57:41.753]  I mean, I could be looking at $1,130 gold tomorrow.
[00:57:41.753 --> 00:57:45.194]  I mean, that's what happens when you jump through the next resistance level.
[00:57:45.194 --> 00:57:50.555]  You realize that right now $1,060 an ounce looks cheap right now for gold?
[00:57:50.555 --> 00:57:54.837]  I mean, I was talking about $1,060 becoming a peak here just about a week ago.
[00:57:55.885 --> 00:58:00.448]  And now we're looking at that, and we'd be happy to be able to pay that again for it.
[00:58:00.448 --> 00:58:01.728]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:01.728 --> 00:58:04.050]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:09.073]  The brokers are there right now.
[00:58:09.073 --> 00:58:11.174]  Tell them it's the Ted Anderson Alex Jones Special.
[00:58:11.174 --> 00:58:17.217]  If you want to get the lower prices, even the higher prices are a great deal, but this is just an amazing deal.
[00:58:17.217 --> 00:58:17.257]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:29.293]  I buy gold and silver as an emergency hedge because the other investments aren't trustworthy and are deteriorating.
[00:58:29.293 --> 00:58:31.374]  But a lot of people are buying it for investment.
[00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:36.235]  It's certainly pushing a four times increase from what it was.
[00:58:36.235 --> 00:58:36.295]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:36.295 --> 00:58:38.736]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.736 --> 00:58:43.538]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.302 --> 00:58:54.864]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:55.764]  Number one.
[00:58:55.764 --> 00:58:59.185]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.185 --> 00:59:00.045]  Number two.
[00:59:00.045 --> 00:59:04.947]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.947 --> 00:59:05.687]  It's true.
[00:59:05.687 --> 00:59:10.229]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:11.370]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:14.953]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.953 --> 00:59:18.897]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.897 --> 00:59:19.677]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.677 --> 00:59:22.440]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:26.123]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.123 --> 00:59:26.924]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.924 --> 00:59:31.068]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:35.832]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.112 --> 00:59:40.274]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.274 --> 00:59:42.055]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:55.943 --> 01:00:05.188]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:05.768]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:08.232]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.232 --> 01:00:09.994]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.994 --> 01:00:11.575]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.136]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.136 --> 01:00:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:24.866]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.866 --> 01:00:28.149]  Coming up, the Institute for War and Peace reporting
[01:00:29.491 --> 01:00:31.513]  Headline, persistent rumors of U.S.
[01:00:31.513 --> 01:00:37.137]  helicopters ferrying Taliban to destabilize Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:41.280]  We know this happened in 2001-2002, known as the Airlift of Evil.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:47.244]  Times of London Associated Press reporting that thousands and thousands of Taliban and Al-Qaeda were loaded on U.S.
[01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:49.226]  helicopters and flown to safety.
[01:00:49.226 --> 01:00:50.287]  We know that deal was staged.
[01:00:50.287 --> 01:00:51.828]  I'm going to be covering that.
[01:00:51.828 --> 01:00:56.872]  Talk about the big GOP sweep around the country, what that signifies for Obama.
[01:00:57.512 --> 01:00:57.753]  I think?
[01:01:11.161 --> 01:01:15.803]  I had a cop pull a gun on me yesterday because there's this big farm out by where I grew up.
[01:01:15.803 --> 01:01:16.524]  We have a farm also.
[01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:38.481]  And, uh, there... I watched these chemtrails just come all over all our crops, you know, right above my house.
[01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:42.542]  These chemicals are falling on my house, you know, so I'm obviously a little bit pissed off.
[01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:58.387]  And, uh, I went to go talk to him about it, you know, I pretty much called him out, be like, you know, I see all your symbolism on your trucks, you know, all this stuff, and, you know, you think people are stupid, and you put these markings that I mean, you know... You gotta be a moron not to think that these people aren't maybe the best type of people.
[01:01:59.085 --> 01:02:01.485]  And, you know, and they were all like, oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:02.406]  It's, you know, the airport.
[01:02:02.406 --> 01:02:04.406]  You know, we don't have nothing to do with that.
[01:02:04.406 --> 01:02:09.047]  And then, uh, when I said, well, why don't I just take a, uh, sample of your soil and have it, you know, independently tested?
[01:02:09.047 --> 01:02:11.347]  And they freaked out.
[01:02:11.347 --> 01:02:13.208]  Just absolutely freaked out.
[01:02:13.208 --> 01:02:14.188]  You can't do that!
[01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:15.128]  You can't do that!
[01:02:15.128 --> 01:02:17.309]  You know, because they know, they know what they're doing.
[01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:18.949]  What airport is this?
[01:02:18.949 --> 01:02:20.149]  No, this is not an airport.
[01:02:20.149 --> 01:02:21.989]  They, they, they tried to blame it on the airport.
[01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:24.590]  This is a, um, just far away, out in the middle of Indiana.
[01:02:25.327 --> 01:02:32.030]  And then, you know, not even, I didn't even get a mile down the road, I went to go talk to an old, um, uh, the father of one of my friends growing up.
[01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:35.932]  Sir, who were you, who were you saying was spraying you?
[01:02:35.932 --> 01:02:45.316]  Oh, who knows, but I know, I know, I know this farmer is in charge of, um, they, they bought up a whole bunch of land around here, you know, a lot of, a lot of cropland, a lot, a lot of corn.
[01:02:45.316 --> 01:02:47.877]  And so they're crop, and so they're crop dusting.
[01:02:47.877 --> 01:02:52.339]  Uh-huh, and then, and then they get pulled over, and I, I mentioned this, all the cop, you know, they, they,
[01:02:52.765 --> 01:02:55.587]  Yeah, the same cop would tell you there's no mercury in the vaccines.
[01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:55.867]  Thanks, Ryan.
[01:02:55.867 --> 01:02:57.889]  Kerry in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:25.003]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to talk a little about the CIT group bankruptcy.
[01:03:25.003 --> 01:03:30.290]  CIT group is not the same institution as Citigroup or Citibank.
[01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:31.692]  CIT group actually
[01:03:32.774 --> 01:03:41.940]  It's more significant with the bankruptcies in reference to what you and Bob Chapman have been talking about for the past year and a half, which is the next shoot-a-fall commercial real estate.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:49.424]  But see, I thought that on Monday when I saw it, because it said CIT Group, but then I saw other reports that it's part of Citi Group.
[01:03:49.424 --> 01:03:50.205]  Is that wrong?
[01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:51.606]  Because I get things wrong.
[01:03:52.307 --> 01:04:06.784]  No, yeah, I know what the reports you saw, because they've actually... One of the big reports that came out, they wrote CIT in small letters instead of big letters, and then they wrote group after it so that people thought that it was city group, but no, it's actually CIT group.
[01:04:06.784 --> 01:04:10.168]  It's not insignificant, though, that they went bankrupt.
[01:04:10.168 --> 01:04:12.451]  They've been walking zombies for like a year.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.884]  And the big thing with them is they were so heavily invested in commercial real estate.
[01:04:17.884 --> 01:04:21.907]  I don't think they'd allow, like, Citibank to get taken down.
[01:04:21.907 --> 01:04:25.090]  CIT Group is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:25.871]  No, you're right.
[01:04:25.871 --> 01:04:26.431]  You're right.
[01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:29.033]  And I remember, what was that Associated Press headline?
[01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:31.616]  And it said, Citigroup fails.
[01:04:32.556 --> 01:04:33.518]  And then I'm looking at it.
[01:04:33.518 --> 01:04:36.942]  It says Citigroup bankrupt in one headline.
[01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:39.305]  Then another says Citigroup versus Citigroup.
[01:04:39.305 --> 01:04:41.247]  CIT group versus Citigroup.
[01:04:41.247 --> 01:04:41.988]  There you go.
[01:04:41.988 --> 01:04:42.729]  So that's a mistake.
[01:04:42.729 --> 01:04:43.890]  Well, that's good news.
[01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.214]  But then I saw the other report saying what happens if Citigroup fails?
[01:04:48.015 --> 01:04:50.996]  And so, boy, that is a big correction I need to make.
[01:04:50.996 --> 01:04:53.736]  Tell me more about CIT Group on the other side.
[01:04:53.736 --> 01:04:57.897]  See, I told you folks, we do make mistakes from time to time and we will fix it.
[01:04:57.897 --> 01:05:00.518]  But why is the media then writing the headlines?
[01:05:00.518 --> 01:05:08.240]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.321]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[01:05:14.321 --> 01:05:16.982]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:05:17.282 --> 01:05:23.546]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:05:23.546 --> 01:05:27.628]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:27.628 --> 01:05:32.931]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:05:33.231 --> 01:05:35.313]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:05:35.313 --> 01:05:37.075]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:05:37.075 --> 01:05:39.597]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:05:39.597 --> 01:05:44.322]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:05:44.322 --> 01:05:48.045]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:51.168]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:51.168 --> 01:05:53.070]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:55.172]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.344]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.344 --> 01:06:08.587]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:13.392]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.392 --> 01:06:19.758]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.758 --> 01:06:22.021]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:24.002]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.002 --> 01:06:24.683]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:24.683 --> 01:06:26.804]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.454 --> 01:06:48.717]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:57.820]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:08.943]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:12.323]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:18.185]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.185 --> 01:07:22.966]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:22.966 --> 01:07:25.306]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:25.966]  I'm good.
[01:07:44.417 --> 01:07:48.138]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:07:48.138 --> 01:07:50.318]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.

[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.020]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.861]  Do it now.
[01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:07.422]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:24.883]  Yeah, I've googled the term and I'm not the only one that got confused by headlines saying CIT group files for bankruptcy.
[01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:30.105]  Then sites all over the country and the world said CIT group filing for bankruptcy.
[01:08:30.105 --> 01:08:33.686]  Then there's other articles now today saying CIT group versus CIT group.
[01:08:33.686 --> 01:08:35.467]  CIT files for bankruptcy.
[01:08:35.467 --> 01:08:36.927]  What about CIT group?
[01:08:36.927 --> 01:08:39.208]  So that created all this confusion and I
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.101]  Got that wrong, but I'm not the only one.
[01:08:44.101 --> 01:08:52.022]  Because at the same time in the news, they're talking about Citigroup going down next, or Bank of America.
[01:08:52.022 --> 01:08:55.423]  That's been discussed for the last year, so that's how that happened.
[01:08:55.423 --> 01:09:01.945]  And that's why I love taking your phone calls, because we make a mistake or so every week of that magnitude.
[01:09:01.945 --> 01:09:04.305]  So thank you so much, Carrie in Mississippi.
[01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:07.006]  But yeah, CIT Group, it's giant as well.
[01:09:07.006 --> 01:09:07.946]  Tell us about that, Carrie.
[01:09:08.888 --> 01:09:17.340]  Yeah, well you know, a lot of people were confused about that, and like you said, there were some really obvious mistakes that were made by the media reporting agencies that lifted my eyebrow.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.084]  But not to be confused with Citigroup.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.302]  Was invested heavily in CIT Group.
[01:09:23.302 --> 01:09:25.483]  Yeah, well that's what I saw in headlines Monday too.
[01:09:25.483 --> 01:09:28.485]  It was CIT Group bankrupt.
[01:09:28.485 --> 01:09:29.986]  What does this mean for Citi Group?
[01:09:29.986 --> 01:09:44.677]  In fact, that was the exact headline and that's I think how everybody got confused because it was all over the news saying CIT connected to Citi Group bankruptcy and so that's why this was being reported everywhere, not just here, yeah.
[01:09:44.677 --> 01:09:45.717]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:45.717 --> 01:09:49.320]  CIT Group was very heavily invested in commercial real estate and
[01:09:49.878 --> 01:09:55.060]  They really started getting hit with the default on commercial, which is just starting.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:04.965]  Like I said, you and Bob Chapman have been warning about, for a year, the residential real estate is just a drop in the bucket compared to the size of commercial.
[01:10:04.965 --> 01:10:14.129]  And the major banks, like Citigroup, the Bank of America, Bear Stearns, before they went down, they were heavily invested in commercial and residential.
[01:10:14.588 --> 01:10:20.812]  But the difference in the way that they handled those assets was that the residential, they disbossed in securities.
[01:10:20.812 --> 01:10:24.814]  A lot of the commercial, they kept a hold of those loans.
[01:10:24.814 --> 01:10:40.304]  They're now starting to disown, because like with Citi Group and CIT Group, when Citi Group saw how much trouble CIT Group was in, they pulled out, which is one of the reasons CIT Group is now in bankruptcy, because so many of the banks, the actual commercial banks,
[01:10:40.663 --> 01:10:46.527]  They were investing them, or helping them, or extending a line of credit to them, started to pull back.
[01:10:46.527 --> 01:10:53.091]  They've been walking dead, like I said, for probably six, eight months, at least, just CIT Group.
[01:10:53.091 --> 01:11:00.116]  So, you know, CIT Group itself, the bank, they are a member of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:11:00.116 --> 01:11:10.043]  You know, back in the days when they were National City Bank of New York City, they were one of the founding members, one of the primary class A stockholders of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
[01:11:10.965 --> 01:11:12.665]  Yes, I'm reading over it.
[01:11:12.665 --> 01:11:14.806]  I'm reading over it right now.
[01:11:14.806 --> 01:11:19.307]  And that's clearly what the media is saying is that the two are interconnected heavily.
[01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:24.788]  And so that's what caused all the confusion, not just the name similarity, but the fact that the two are intertwined.
[01:11:24.788 --> 01:11:29.129]  And yes, I know the Citigroup itself is a Federal Reserve shareholder.
[01:11:29.129 --> 01:11:32.670]  Thank you so much, Kerry, for setting us straight on that.
[01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:33.951]  James in Ohio.
[01:11:33.951 --> 01:11:34.931]  James, you're on the air.
[01:11:34.931 --> 01:11:35.351]  Go ahead.
[01:11:35.351 --> 01:11:37.071]  Hey, Alex.
[01:11:37.071 --> 01:11:38.112]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:11:39.738 --> 01:11:42.480]  I just want to tell you, great job on Fall of the Republic.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.863]  Anybody listening, if you ain't seen it, you really need to watch it, get a copy somehow.
[01:11:47.863 --> 01:11:48.783]  I've been learning now.
[01:11:48.783 --> 01:11:51.725]  Well, and it's not just for people that already know what's going on.
[01:11:51.725 --> 01:12:05.773]  It's made for people that don't know, and it's done in a very easy to understand, but also very, very, not entertaining, but very, very riveting and well done way.
[01:12:05.773 --> 01:12:08.935]  I think in my opinion, it puts a little more names to the faces.
[01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:24.694]  Well, it shows Obama and other world leaders calling for world government.
[01:12:24.694 --> 01:12:29.336]  It shows them saying one thing previously and then saying another.
[01:12:29.336 --> 01:12:37.138]  It really shows the lies of these people and it also is all about showing how Republicans and Democrats at the highest levels work for the same group.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:45.851]  Well, if you watch it also, you watch the movie and then yesterday the Chancellor of Germany played right into it perfectly too.
[01:12:45.851 --> 01:12:47.233]  That was beautiful.
[01:12:47.233 --> 01:12:51.519]  Yeah, she said we've got to have this global tax to save our Earth.
[01:12:51.519 --> 01:12:53.622]  Meanwhile, Al Gore's come out and admitted...
[01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.658]  It's an amazing admission.
[01:12:56.658 --> 01:12:59.318]  This Prison Planet article should go out everywhere.
[01:12:59.318 --> 01:13:05.240]  Al Gore admits CO2 does not cause majority of global warming because people are now looking at the actual science.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:10.702]  Even the UN's own report says a tiny amount of CO2 is human-generated.
[01:13:10.702 --> 01:13:12.383]  I mean, the oceans are the biggest driver.
[01:13:12.383 --> 01:13:17.564]  They release just unbelievable amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:19.985]  It's just unbelievably huge.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:27.821]  I wanted to ask you if you was able to get in contact with Jimbo Traficant.
[01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:35.202]  We've tried really hard and no, we've probably called Traficant 20 times, talked to his wife a whole bunch, and she keeps saying she'll pass on the message.
[01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:38.683]  So if anybody knows Traficant, tell him to come on the show.
[01:13:38.683 --> 01:13:40.923]  Appreciate the call.
[01:13:40.923 --> 01:13:42.984]  Let's talk to Scott in Arizona.
[01:13:42.984 --> 01:13:44.624]  Scott, you're on the air.
[01:13:44.624 --> 01:13:48.625]  Hey Alex, ditto on the, kudos on the movie.
[01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:54.671]  Question for you, I tried to get through yesterday and I couldn't quite gather from the comments you were making.
[01:13:55.616 --> 01:14:06.223]  Originally, when you were talking about Camp FEMA, which I also picked up from you, the word was that Gary Franchi and groups said, no, we're not going to release this.
[01:14:06.223 --> 01:14:07.164]  You need to go ahead and buy it.
[01:14:07.164 --> 01:14:15.170]  A couple comments you made yesterday gave me the impression that maybe that could possibly be compressed and bundled and given out with Fall of the Republic.
[01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.851]  I wanted a little clarification on that.
[01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:18.272]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:14:18.272 --> 01:14:19.593]  Here's the deal.
[01:14:19.593 --> 01:14:22.094]  I can only speak for Alex Jones.
[01:14:22.094 --> 01:14:23.815]  I make my documentary films.
[01:14:24.796 --> 01:14:34.363]  And I encourage people to make copies of them for not-for-sale purposes, because if I let people sell them, number one, I won't be making another film because I'll be bankrupt.
[01:14:34.363 --> 01:14:38.367]  Number two, I can lose control of my films.
[01:14:38.367 --> 01:14:39.708]  They can then say that they're their films.
[01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.909]  We've had people even try that.
[01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:42.069]  Now,
[01:14:43.283 --> 01:14:59.514]  Separately, I can't sit here and speak for other filmmakers, but I think you should buy the original DVD of Camp FEMA, and have viewing parties, and show it to people, and they said you can show it in theaters to folks, but I can't sit here and speak for people.
[01:14:59.514 --> 01:15:02.436]  Camp FEMA is not my documentary.
[01:15:02.436 --> 01:15:03.657]  I didn't make Camp FEMA.
[01:15:03.657 --> 01:15:05.858]  I consulted on it some.
[01:15:05.858 --> 01:15:07.219]  I'm the main presenter.
[01:15:07.219 --> 01:15:12.663]  There's a lot of other great presenters in it, and it's just a very good film you can give people to explain the FEMA camps.
[01:15:13.803 --> 01:15:23.005]  But yes, follow the Republic, and my other documentaries on the back, it says copy and share this disc.
[01:15:23.005 --> 01:15:25.946]  So, again, I'm not Gary Franchi or William Lewis.
[01:15:25.946 --> 01:15:27.807]  I cannot speak for them, sir.
[01:15:27.807 --> 01:15:31.047]  Yeah, I just wanted to... Okay, I just... But I'm not them.
[01:15:31.047 --> 01:15:40.230]  Yeah, absolutely, and just want to let you know, just to brighten your day a little bit, we got 500 copies made, and those are going out, and we're fixing to do another 500, so we're mass
[01:15:42.628 --> 01:15:46.793]  Mass viral, virally getting this stuff out.
[01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:50.717]  You are, you are awesome Scott.
[01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:52.900]  What response are you getting from the people you've given it to?
[01:15:55.386 --> 01:16:00.270]  I don't know half the people, or most of the people, that it's going to.
[01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:06.676]  The response, typically how I approach people on this, though, is I just have to say, hey, you know, do you love this country?
[01:16:06.676 --> 01:16:07.597]  Do you like this country?
[01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:08.157]  Yes, I do.
[01:16:08.157 --> 01:16:10.039]  I mean, the obvious answer to that one.
[01:16:10.039 --> 01:16:12.941]  And do you sense that there's something wrong going on?
[01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:14.582]  Yeah, there's definitely something wrong going on.
[01:16:14.582 --> 01:16:17.245]  You know, everybody, just like you talked about, everybody
[01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:18.466]  We're good to go.
[01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:42.589]  So, you know, people are very receptive to it, and, uh, you know, they want to take it, they want to watch it.
[01:16:42.589 --> 01:17:04.046]  I was handing them out on Halloween, you know, I took the kids trick-or-treating in each house, you know, I'd go to the house and say, hey, I've got a treat for you as the adult, and I ran into some people who said, oh, yeah, you know, we definitely are into this stuff, and, you know, they didn't necessarily know of you, but they've heard of the Michael Moore stuff or Glenn Beck, you know, and if somebody says, oh, I like Glenn Beck, you know, I say, well, you've got to take this and get the real truth.
[01:17:04.866 --> 01:17:24.315]  See, Michael Moore is the anti-establishment person to soak up all the revolution on the left, and Glenn Beck is the supposed right-winger anti-establishment counterfeit, and he's supposed to control the revolution from the right and to keep it in a left-right paradigm.
[01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:26.656]  And I'm not here to bash Moore or bash Beck.
[01:17:27.236 --> 01:17:33.800]  The point is, they don't take you all the way with the information, and we do.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:42.444]  And we do it also that's not in a religious or racist manner of all this infighting, because the establishment wants us to make this racial or religious.
[01:17:42.444 --> 01:17:44.325]  That's a further divide-and-conquer system.
[01:17:44.325 --> 01:17:52.310]  We just state what the big banks, what the criminal elite are doing, and the fact that it's illegal, and that it needs to be stopped, and the way you put that, the way
[01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:56.915]  That you're breaking the ice with people is extremely effective.
[01:17:56.915 --> 01:17:57.415]  Great job.
[01:17:57.415 --> 01:17:58.396]  Good to hear from you, Scott.
[01:17:58.396 --> 01:17:59.157]  Keep it up.
[01:17:59.157 --> 01:18:00.799]  Let's talk to Justin in Ohio.
[01:18:00.799 --> 01:18:02.641]  Justin, you're on the air.
[01:18:02.641 --> 01:18:03.982]  Hey, Alex.
[01:18:03.982 --> 01:18:06.665]  Just want to say ditto on the new movie.
[01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:07.326]  Looks pretty good.
[01:18:07.326 --> 01:18:08.708]  Thank you.
[01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:11.451]  Also having a large screening party at my home.
[01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:14.374]  I have about 85 people or so signed up at my work.
[01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:17.892]  to come to a private viewing of my home this weekend so that should be pretty interesting.
[01:18:17.892 --> 01:18:36.498]  And you'll have fun and hang out and everybody will wake up together and become free people again and create communities instead of everybody going to a sports game in a false community around issues that don't matter or playing all these group video games where everybody gets so obsessed about a little game that doesn't matter.
[01:18:36.498 --> 01:18:40.740]  Instead you're forming real community against the globalists.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.160]  Exactly.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.601]  But I did have three minor points I want to bring up
[01:18:45.534 --> 01:18:52.476]  I work for a larger financial institution that does private funding for retail credit cards.
[01:18:52.476 --> 01:19:01.079]  We have a lot of offices nationwide, but we had a company email come out in regards to H1N1 and the seasonal flu shot.
[01:19:01.079 --> 01:19:07.461]  Now, basically what this boils down to is that they're taking a registration of who is willing to take it and who's not willing to take it.
[01:19:08.396 --> 01:19:16.640]  What I got in my email box two weeks ago was a registration form where you either check yes, I'll take it, or no, I won't.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:24.885]  And they're categorizing, they admit through the census and other federal programs, they're getting maps of what areas are vaccinated, what areas aren't.
[01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:29.267]  So they're creating this list, which can be integrated into the no-fly list.
[01:19:29.267 --> 01:19:35.070]  They're saying in the future, if you don't take the hundreds of shots they're pushing, you're not going to be able to have jobs, be able to travel.
[01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.691]  This is the tyranny that's being set up.
[01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:38.679]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:38.679 --> 01:19:46.928]  And the more troubling part about it is a third party came to administer this shot.
[01:19:46.928 --> 01:19:48.230]  They are called Summit Health.

[01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:50.944]  Continuing with your phone calls, big news blitz coming up.
[01:24:12.588 --> 01:24:17.112]  Going back to Justin in Ohio.
[01:24:17.112 --> 01:24:19.954]  Justin, you were bringing up the waiver form.
[01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:27.540]  Was this a waiver saying, oh, you understand you're not protected now, kind of a psychological manipulation?
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:32.885]  Or was it a waiver that you saw that you would have had to sign if you took the shot?
[01:24:32.885 --> 01:24:39.430]  Well, basically what it breaks down to is if you take the shot, you waive your rights to basically
[01:24:40.143 --> 01:24:43.287]  So are they trying to make you sign this if you didn't take it or make you sign it if you did take it?
[01:25:01.483 --> 01:25:07.344]  If you did take it, however, but with that email, they are registering who is not taking it as well.
[01:25:07.344 --> 01:25:10.605]  And all throughout our building, there's things promoting, you know, you better take your shot.
[01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:13.265]  If you don't get your shot, you know, you're going to get sick.
[01:25:13.265 --> 01:25:14.726]  If you're pregnant, you better get a shot.
[01:25:14.726 --> 01:25:15.786]  Your kid's going to get sick.
[01:25:15.786 --> 01:25:27.088]  And all this is with the flu shot is a giant concerted effort of the United Nations giving the United States orders, and then the federal government giving orders to not just the states and counties and cities,
[01:25:27.828 --> 01:25:31.673]  But private institutions, hospitals, banks, everywhere...
[01:25:32.984 --> 01:25:42.272]  Testing what local managers, what CEOs will follow the orders to aggressively push this on people and all over the country.
[01:25:42.272 --> 01:25:45.375]  They're not just telling medical workers they'll be fired if they don't take it.
[01:25:45.375 --> 01:25:51.019]  They're telling people working at factories and grocery stores and in shipyards that they'll be fired.
[01:25:51.019 --> 01:25:58.246]  There's no law, but it's a type of corporate tyranny of slavery where you're threatened with your job if you don't do it.
[01:25:58.986 --> 01:26:07.675]  And this is racketeering by the private vaccine makers in an organized group criminally trying to force you to take their product.
[01:26:07.675 --> 01:26:09.557]  And it's outrageous.
[01:26:09.557 --> 01:26:10.478]  Absolutely.
[01:26:10.478 --> 01:26:14.222]  And you know, I do have to get into work, so I'll be short with this.
[01:26:14.222 --> 01:26:19.448]  Icing on the cake, they are offering you a 20% discount on your health insurance.
[01:26:19.844 --> 01:26:20.064]  Absolutely.
[01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:44.131]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is bigger than just the vaccine maker making a hundred bucks from the federal grant to give it to you.
[01:26:44.131 --> 01:26:46.592]  Why do they want that shot in you so bad?
[01:26:46.592 --> 01:26:52.834]  More importantly, they want to set the precedent to force you to take inoculations.
[01:26:52.834 --> 01:27:00.176]  So in the future, you're not just going to get a discount, you're going to be penalized if you don't take it.
[01:27:00.176 --> 01:27:00.956]  Absolutely.
[01:27:00.956 --> 01:27:06.438]  Well, again, Alex, I'll go ahead and mail you guys or shoot you a scanned copy of this form.
[01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:10.096]  But I just want to say thank you very much and continue the fight.
[01:27:10.096 --> 01:27:11.937]  Yeah, I know you're busy at work, but do me a favor.
[01:27:11.937 --> 01:27:14.278]  Write a short blurb describing it.
[01:27:14.278 --> 01:27:21.282]  Send it to riders at infowars.com as an attachment, and we will post it up on the site.
[01:27:21.282 --> 01:27:22.943]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:22.943 --> 01:27:24.784]  Great call from Justin.
[01:27:24.784 --> 01:27:29.227]  And I had seen reports where they're giving you insurance incentives, discounts.
[01:27:29.227 --> 01:27:30.487]  I hadn't heard of a 20% discount.
[01:27:30.487 --> 01:27:32.869]  I mean, that is massive.
[01:27:36.564 --> 01:27:45.126]  But this is to set the precedent, to prime the pump, to incentivize mass adoption of forced inoculations.
[01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:56.189]  And we know that they're spending billions and billions of dollars of federal and state money paying off local businesses, paying off churches, paying off hospitals and public schools to try to push this.
[01:27:56.189 --> 01:28:01.171]  That's why all over the country, every day, scores of reports come out.
[01:28:01.171 --> 01:28:05.172]  We covered them here, we post them on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:07.447]  How's it going today, Alex?
[01:28:29.853 --> 01:28:33.696]  Yeah, I just had an issue I wanted to talk about here with tasering.
[01:28:33.696 --> 01:28:44.262]  I saw that video the other day of the guy getting tasered with just his hands on the front hood of the car there in Minneapolis, and it reminded me of an incident that happened here in my town a few weeks back.
[01:28:44.262 --> 01:28:57.030]  I had a friend, he's actually a Marine Corps veteran, an Iraq veteran, and he got tased by the police for absolutely no reason other than standing up for the one other guy who was being surrounded by the four police officers.
[01:28:57.853 --> 01:29:02.560]  It's absolutely criminal what these people are doing and it's totally despicable as well that they would do that to veterans.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:09.650]  Well the police have been told, and I'm going to hold you over, the police have been told this is being done for pain compliance.
[01:29:10.775 --> 01:29:18.277]  And it's on record, a judge in New York said they can taser you to make you answer questions.
[01:29:18.277 --> 01:29:20.957]  And they're tasering people who won't give urine samples.
[01:29:20.957 --> 01:29:29.599]  They're tasering people that say, I have rights, to where if you don't submit verbally, or you don't answer questions, they're going to torture you.
[01:29:29.599 --> 01:29:38.681]  So all of America's being turned into a giant camp x-ray, or Abu Ghraib, and you say, hey, he's a Marine Corps veteran, they want to attack him even more.
[01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:44.623]  The MIAC and Homeland Security reports state that it's the veterans that are hated.
[01:29:44.623 --> 01:29:48.864]  Unless you're a veteran and become a police officer, then you become a god.
[01:29:48.864 --> 01:29:51.305]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.305 --> 01:29:52.685]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.685 --> 01:29:55.226]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.226 --> 01:29:57.907]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.172 --> 01:30:04.195]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.195 --> 01:30:09.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.562]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.562 --> 01:30:16.567]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.567 --> 01:30:17.488]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.728 --> 01:30:18.869]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.869 --> 01:30:20.750]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:21.811]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:24.032]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.032 --> 01:30:25.373]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.373 --> 01:30:26.894]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.894 --> 01:30:32.157]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.157 --> 01:30:35.740]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:39.222]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.562 --> 01:30:40.782]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.782 --> 01:30:41.683]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.683 --> 01:30:42.783]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.783 --> 01:30:43.723]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.723 --> 01:30:44.824]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.824 --> 01:30:47.865]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.865 --> 01:30:50.106]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:50.106 --> 01:30:51.066]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.131 --> 01:31:07.113]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:07.113 --> 01:31:09.214]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.455]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:31:11.455 --> 01:31:13.095]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:31:13.095 --> 01:31:17.437]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:31:36.485 --> 01:31:43.648]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:49.851]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:31:59.955 --> 01:32:05.261]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.261 --> 01:32:09.786]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.786 --> 01:32:12.069]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.069 --> 01:32:13.691]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.691 --> 01:32:14.712]  There is a solution.
[01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:23.381]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:24.595]  So much going on, so much going on.
[01:33:24.595 --> 01:33:28.778]  So many things going on in the world.
[01:33:28.778 --> 01:33:34.322]  Babies dying, mothers crying.
[01:33:34.322 --> 01:33:39.846]  How much all this one human life worth.
[01:33:39.846 --> 01:33:41.187]  What happened to us?
[01:33:44.639 --> 01:33:55.784]  The police have been given less lethal weapons so they can blur the lines and start attacking the people and so it will be accepted.
[01:33:55.784 --> 01:34:03.528]  Pregnant women, you name it, get tasered if they just say, no, I'm not going to sign the ticket.
[01:34:03.528 --> 01:34:05.589]  The cop could then just arrest them, but they don't.
[01:34:05.589 --> 01:34:08.210]  They taser them to punish them.
[01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:18.766]  I mean, you didn't see police 20 years ago saying no demonstrations allowed or no one allowed on the streets of a major city like we saw in Pittsburgh at G20.
[01:34:18.766 --> 01:34:28.552]  And we witnessed old women coming out of stores with bags in their hands and saying, I'm not allowed on the street, officer, I'm shopping.
[01:34:28.552 --> 01:34:32.595]  And the cops just turn the German Shepherd loose on them and they bite them.
[01:34:32.595 --> 01:34:33.716]  And the blood starts dripping.
[01:34:36.187 --> 01:34:39.429]  And then everyone was submitting three days into it.
[01:34:39.429 --> 01:34:41.450]  The G20 had ended on Friday night.
[01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:50.396]  The cops were all masked up by the thousands in their riot gear with National Guard, driving around with sound cannons, blasting nine-year-olds playing football in their front yards in the afternoon.
[01:34:50.396 --> 01:34:59.021]  They drove into the university, where the college students were out in the park, and said, leave, and then attacked them.
[01:34:59.021 --> 01:35:00.522]  This was all on local news.
[01:35:00.522 --> 01:35:01.463]  Local news admitted it.
[01:35:03.015 --> 01:35:13.222]  And you'd have young women on bikes trying to run and the police would charge out, block them, and then slam their heads into the ground and bludgeon them with batons.
[01:35:13.222 --> 01:35:15.104]  I mean, it's crazy!
[01:35:15.104 --> 01:35:17.305]  It's crazy!
[01:35:17.305 --> 01:35:18.346]  That is tyranny.
[01:35:18.346 --> 01:35:19.687]  That is Soviet Russia.
[01:35:19.687 --> 01:35:20.668]  That's Communist China.
[01:35:23.325 --> 01:35:29.789]  The establishment knows there's going to be mass protests and demonstrations and calls to arrest the bankers and calls for justice.
[01:35:29.789 --> 01:35:48.082]  So they've been slowly training the police and acclimating them that it's normal procedure and that they're in the right and that it's good through peer pressure to be macho with a bunch of old women and college kids and to lie and to engage in corruption.
[01:35:48.082 --> 01:35:49.843]  Going back to Kyle in California.
[01:35:49.843 --> 01:35:50.844]  Kyle, finish up your point.
[01:35:51.778 --> 01:35:52.819]  Yeah, that's what this was.
[01:35:52.819 --> 01:36:09.474]  I mean, the way I look at this is it's basically electrocution until compliance, which brings up an eerie resemblance to 1984 and what happens to Winston in Room 101 in the Ministry of Love, where he's continually electrocuted through his spine until he believes that 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:36:09.474 --> 01:36:10.635]  This is absolutely horrible.
[01:36:10.635 --> 01:36:14.278]  The fact that they do it on unarmed people is cowardly.
[01:36:14.278 --> 01:36:16.680]  I mean, I can't believe how they would even do something like that.
[01:36:17.439 --> 01:36:20.542]  The other issue I want to bring up to you, Alex, is that we are doing something about this.
[01:36:20.542 --> 01:36:36.814]  There's going to be an agenda item here on our city council, and we're going to be bringing this up, because this whole idea that they can taser people who don't have any weapons on them is completely against what they all told us what tasers were going to be for, which was a supposed non-lethal way to stop people that had a lethal weapon.
[01:36:37.569 --> 01:36:46.793]  I also want to let you know we've been putting your films out on public access here and getting a really good reception from all the people and they keep calling us to ask for more videos.
[01:36:46.793 --> 01:36:50.555]  So far, Endgame's up there, Fall of the Republic, Camp FEMA.
[01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:53.637]  People are really starting to wake up, I think.
[01:36:53.637 --> 01:36:54.777]  Good job, my friend.
[01:36:54.777 --> 01:36:56.838]  God bless you and keep it up, Kyle.
[01:36:56.838 --> 01:37:04.402]  You know, I talked in the last few days about watching Transformers Revenge of the Fallen and all of the messages that were in it.
[01:37:05.822 --> 01:37:10.266]  And one of the messages was, torture is good.
[01:37:10.266 --> 01:37:19.174]  And over and over again, the good guys taser people and taser their friends and it's funny and happy and cute.
[01:37:19.174 --> 01:37:22.698]  And that's why they taser police in their training to teach them that it's no big deal.
[01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:26.133]  But the police only take a tiny jolt.
[01:37:26.133 --> 01:37:31.276]  When they actually get you on the ground, they taser you over and over and over again.
[01:37:31.276 --> 01:37:33.037]  And I don't watch a lot of movies.
[01:37:33.037 --> 01:37:35.978]  I don't watch a ton of television, though I do monitor it.
[01:37:35.978 --> 01:37:45.444]  And I can't tell you how many movies I've seen that have come out in the last few years where tasering is cute and funny and everybody laughs.
[01:37:45.444 --> 01:37:48.745]  Just like I see all these movies where torture is funny and everybody laughs.
[01:37:48.745 --> 01:37:51.307]  That happens in Transformers Revenge of the Fallen.
[01:37:53.046 --> 01:38:07.776]  There's this robot that's very childlike and cute and funny and they torture it and burn his eyes out and he giggles and likes it and it's cute and the beautiful girl does it and he turns out being their friend and likes them and thanks them for burning his eyes out.
[01:38:07.776 --> 01:38:16.321]  I mean, the federal government is paying to acclimate you that death and murder and torture and tasering is good.
[01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:19.463]  And police all over the country say, answer my question.
[01:38:19.463 --> 01:38:21.024]  If you don't answer it, they taser you.
[01:38:21.024 --> 01:38:21.825]  That is torture.
[01:38:23.968 --> 01:38:24.888]  Let's take another call.
[01:38:24.888 --> 01:38:26.428]  Wide open phones.
[01:38:26.428 --> 01:38:27.569]  Billman in Florida.
[01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:28.909]  You're on the air.
[01:38:28.909 --> 01:38:29.969]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:38:29.969 --> 01:38:31.229]  Good, sir.
[01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:32.069]  Good.
[01:38:32.069 --> 01:38:32.770]  Settle down a little.
[01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:35.370]  You've been fired up this week, man.
[01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:36.510]  You had me fired up the other day.
[01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.770]  I came home.
[01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:49.353]  Industry I work in, both my roommates, they recently got married, work in the same industry, but they directly supplement the military non-combatant services.
[01:38:49.353 --> 01:38:51.673]  So, came home and started talking with them about
[01:38:52.892 --> 01:39:01.459]  I mean, they've released everything, 9-11 and the war and the military, and they pretty much follow suit as far as, they have the same brainwashing.
[01:39:01.459 --> 01:39:10.346]  They pretty much think that we shouldn't even protest the war, that we're making the soldiers insecure and unsure of themselves, sending them over there.
[01:39:10.346 --> 01:39:14.910]  I don't know, it's just pathetic, the lines that they think along.
[01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:21.415]  But talking about the flu shot up in Swine Flu, my company actually offers them for free.
[01:39:22.543 --> 01:39:33.870]  The regular flu shot at my work, and if you can't get it at our work, they give you vouchers to go to wherever else you want to get it, and also you can get the H1N1 not there directly.
[01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:41.315]  So, I just wanted to sign up for the regular swine flu to go there, maybe like, because I see the nurses there every time I go there to the doctor.
[01:39:41.315 --> 01:39:50.441]  I wanted to maybe let them know what they're subjecting themselves and us to, and maybe open the eyes of some of the other people that I work with, but it seems like they're pushing it back.
[01:39:50.441 --> 01:39:51.922]  They push my date back until
[01:39:52.845 --> 01:39:54.086]  November but I canceled it.
[01:39:54.086 --> 01:39:59.991]  So I'm wondering if they're pushing these back for some reason because people aren't taking the regular swine flu and they want people to take it.
[01:39:59.991 --> 01:40:01.292]  Yes, were you listening yesterday?
[01:40:01.292 --> 01:40:04.355]  We played a Council on Foreign Relations clip.
[01:40:04.355 --> 01:40:17.005]  Yeah, and actually yesterday they were talking about, you know, how it's directly pushed through the works in schools and it's not being, the clinics aren't pushing it a lot, but I went to CVS the other day and on my CVS bag is printed up on the swine flu and
[01:40:18.439 --> 01:40:25.823]  You know, come take it here, and even the local dentists have their signs up about, you know, you don't want the swine flu, go get your ointment.
[01:40:25.823 --> 01:40:29.725]  You know, they're even supporting, you know, the doctor.
[01:40:29.725 --> 01:40:30.685]  It's a total push.
[01:40:30.685 --> 01:40:31.585]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:31.585 --> 01:40:36.688]  That's an important information.
[01:40:36.688 --> 01:40:45.332]  The Council on Foreign Relations released an audio blog of one of their meetings where these government officials, heads of universities, top health care
[01:40:48.351 --> 01:40:56.973]  Executives are talking about, oh my gosh, the conspiracy theorists, the crazies are telling people don't take the flu shot, it's dangerous.
[01:40:56.973 --> 01:40:58.033]  What are we going to do?
[01:40:58.033 --> 01:41:04.754]  And one of them says, well, we can say that there's not enough of it, create a shortage at first so people panic and want it.
[01:41:04.754 --> 01:41:05.994]  That's artificial scarcity.
[01:41:05.994 --> 01:41:12.095]  They create the perception that there's a lack of it, that it's something precious.
[01:41:12.095 --> 01:41:14.396]  They announce that there's free shots.
[01:41:15.393 --> 01:41:21.216]  Everybody shows up, they have none of the shots on hand by design to create the panic.
[01:41:21.216 --> 01:41:24.117]  And we had already announced that they were clearly doing that.
[01:41:24.117 --> 01:41:27.199]  And then now they admit that that's their plan.
[01:41:27.199 --> 01:41:30.761]  Everything is about manipulating the population.
[01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:36.984]  And the manipulation is sophisticated, but if you're aware of the manipulation, it's powerless.
[01:41:38.462 --> 01:41:39.762]  It can do nothing to you.
[01:41:39.762 --> 01:41:41.583]  It loses all of its power.
[01:41:41.583 --> 01:41:43.863]  And we are no longer powerless.
[01:41:43.863 --> 01:41:48.945]  And so it's an awakening process that's taking place.
[01:41:48.945 --> 01:42:00.228]  The establishment also will go out and interview 10, 20, 30, 40 people on the street till they find the one person that thinks the swine flu shot is great, and boy, they think everybody should be forced to take it.
[01:42:00.228 --> 01:42:04.909]  But then meanwhile, you can go out to talk to people on the street and the majority are against it, as the polls show.
[01:42:04.909 --> 01:42:06.330]  So that's another way they do this.
[01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:07.370]  I mean, I've talked to airport
[01:42:08.134 --> 01:42:08.414]  I think so.
[01:42:26.832 --> 01:42:31.955]  And he watched every person say, no, I think saying we can't have liquids on the plane is stupid.
[01:42:31.955 --> 01:42:33.596]  I don't like taking my shoes off.
[01:42:33.596 --> 01:42:34.436]  This is wrong.
[01:42:34.436 --> 01:42:36.157]  This is dumb.
[01:42:36.157 --> 01:42:37.638]  This is violating my rights.
[01:42:37.638 --> 01:42:38.619]  I don't like it.
[01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:45.402]  And then finally, one old lady said she loved it, and he knew they were going to close the tripod, turn the camera off, and leave, and they did.
[01:42:45.402 --> 01:42:51.426]  And I saw him up at a local TV station I was at one night that his brother worked at.
[01:42:52.478 --> 01:42:56.320]  And they were in there watching News 8 and he said, I'm waiting for it to come on.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.181]  I'm waiting for it to come on.
[01:42:57.181 --> 01:42:59.703]  They said it was coming on at six.
[01:42:59.703 --> 01:43:00.643]  And I said, what's coming on?
[01:43:00.643 --> 01:43:01.404]  He told me the story.
[01:43:01.404 --> 01:43:07.868]  He said, watch, it's going to be this gray haired old lady and they're sitting there watching it and it comes on and it's her.
[01:43:07.868 --> 01:43:09.289]  Everyone loves it in Austin.
[01:43:09.289 --> 01:43:10.590]  They think the security is great.
[01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:12.731]  They cut to the one old lady saying she loves it.
[01:43:12.731 --> 01:43:18.855]  And he and his brother started laughing and almost rolling around the ground at the manipulation.
[01:43:18.855 --> 01:43:19.015]  So,
[01:43:21.587 --> 01:43:35.417]  That's the type of tricks they're playing to make you feel like you're the minority because you don't want a world government, or you don't want a carbon tax, or you don't want a forced inoculation, or you don't want open borders, or you don't want another banker bailout.
[01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:36.598]  You're the minority.
[01:43:36.598 --> 01:43:38.939]  You don't like the jobless recovery.
[01:43:38.939 --> 01:43:40.260]  No, you're the majority.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:41.301]  You're the common sense.
[01:43:45.117 --> 01:43:48.479]  And then I even buy into the propaganda and say everybody's stupid, everybody's dumb.
[01:43:48.479 --> 01:43:50.140]  No, everybody isn't stupid and dumb.
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:55.904]  What they are is apathetic and they need to have their voices heard and get involved.
[01:43:55.904 --> 01:44:00.627]  You heard the caller earlier in California in a town putting my films on AXS television.
[01:44:00.627 --> 01:44:01.528]  Beautiful!
[01:44:01.528 --> 01:44:02.989]  Everybody should do that.
[01:44:02.989 --> 01:44:06.671]  The feds are shutting AXS TV down all over the country.
[01:44:06.671 --> 01:44:09.553]  The Austin AXS will be shut down within two years.
[01:44:09.553 --> 01:44:12.135]  That's official, barring a miracle.
[01:44:13.444 --> 01:44:15.745]  Should we pressure city council to keep it?
[01:44:15.745 --> 01:44:18.006]  Should we use it while it's there?
[01:44:18.006 --> 01:44:20.887]  My stuff in Austin isn't even on the air anymore.
[01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:25.428]  Some of my old shows that I have are still there, but no one even turns new material in.
[01:44:25.428 --> 01:44:28.229]  I don't have time or energy or staff to go do it.
[01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:30.530]  It's easy, but we aren't doing that.
[01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:33.311]  That reaches tens of thousands every night.
[01:44:33.311 --> 01:44:38.653]  Listeners in Austin should take my films, go down, air them.
[01:44:38.653 --> 01:44:41.254]  You're authorized to.
[01:44:41.254 --> 01:44:42.194]  Obama deception.
[01:44:43.405 --> 01:44:49.329]  All the Republic, they have not aired.
[01:44:49.329 --> 01:44:53.893]  There are so many ways to reach people, but we had better use them now.
[01:44:53.893 --> 01:45:02.018]  In fact, I have it in my stack where they're announcing again, they want to shut off the internet for your safety, and Obama has legislation introduced, the Cybersecurity Act.
[01:45:02.018 --> 01:45:08.963]  This is happening!
[01:45:08.963 --> 01:45:10.544]  Let's go to Nancy in Ohio.
[01:45:10.544 --> 01:45:11.265]  Nancy, welcome.
[01:45:13.868 --> 01:45:14.608]  Hello?
[01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:15.329]  Yes.
[01:45:15.329 --> 01:45:39.084]  Oh, I wondered, uh, there was something wrong with my phone, but I wanted to tell you I live in, um, Traffickin' District, his old district anyways, and I did, I emailed him, because I have an email address, and he wanted more details about your show, so I sent him two of your websites, I also sent him, um, your film, and that was, oh, last week I sent it to him, but
[01:45:39.953 --> 01:45:50.503]  I also worked at General Motors and he's having a meeting with us tonight, so I will probably have an opportunity to talk to him and see if he will be on your show.
[01:45:50.503 --> 01:45:55.368]  Ma'am, I'm going to put you on hold and I'm going to give you the producer phone.
[01:45:55.368 --> 01:45:59.672]  Do you have the producer phone, Jaren, or does Dew have that who's out of town doing a shoot for us?
[01:46:03.795 --> 01:46:09.647]  Okay, I'm going to have Jaren, who's the head producer, give you his cell phone number.
[01:46:10.759 --> 01:46:16.322]  Well, my wife has two phones now, company phones, so you need to get one of those from her.
[01:46:16.322 --> 01:46:17.423]  That's like I said last week.
[01:46:17.423 --> 01:46:19.604]  We need to get you your own phone, Jaren.
[01:46:19.604 --> 01:46:24.867]  But Jaren will give you his cell phone number so you can give it to James Traficant and tell him.
[01:46:24.867 --> 01:46:26.207]  We know he got set up.
[01:46:26.207 --> 01:46:28.288]  We were against him going to prison.
[01:46:28.288 --> 01:46:32.231]  We support him and his bold stand speaking out against government corruption.
[01:46:32.231 --> 01:46:33.911]  We know he was railroaded.
[01:46:33.911 --> 01:46:36.013]  It's a large libertarian talk show.
[01:46:36.013 --> 01:46:37.133]  Just tell him that.
[01:46:37.133 --> 01:46:38.954]  And we do want to get James Traficant on.
[01:46:38.954 --> 01:46:40.335]  That is super news, Nancy.
[01:46:40.967 --> 01:46:50.536]  Yeah, I thought, I was excited when I tried calling last week and I couldn't get through and now it was in the paper that he's having a meeting with us tonight at 7 o'clock.
[01:46:50.536 --> 01:46:53.038]  So I said, oh man, and the other guy called from Ohio.
[01:46:53.038 --> 01:46:54.239]  I said, this is good!
[01:46:54.239 --> 01:46:58.423]  Yeah, I'm getting a lot of emails and calls saying, why aren't you getting trafficking on?
[01:46:58.423 --> 01:47:01.847]  And look, we don't, we don't have godlike powers.
[01:47:02.976 --> 01:47:05.817]  I mean, I struggle to get the trash taken out around here.
[01:47:05.817 --> 01:47:08.418]  I struggle with fruit flies in the office.
[01:47:08.418 --> 01:47:11.479]  I struggle with just keeping the websites up.
[01:47:11.479 --> 01:47:15.540]  For three days, the archive of the live TV show didn't get uploaded.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:18.761]  But we're finally getting fiber optic, because a lot of times the uploads fail.
[01:47:18.761 --> 01:47:21.562]  So, I mean, I'm not whining either.
[01:47:21.562 --> 01:47:28.905]  I'm just saying, we do the best job we can, we're trying to expand, we're trying to fund ourselves, so we've got to deal with that.
[01:47:28.905 --> 01:47:31.466]  People say, you know, do this, do that, but then we don't have the money.
[01:47:33.325 --> 01:47:34.505]  But, absolutely.
[01:47:34.505 --> 01:47:36.946]  We want to get James Traficant on.
[01:47:36.946 --> 01:47:43.547]  And so, I'm going to... Jaren, did you give John Harmon your number?
[01:47:43.547 --> 01:47:44.487]  Okay, great.
[01:47:44.487 --> 01:47:48.708]  Ma'am, I'm going to put you on hold, Nancy, and we're going to give you the producer's private cell phone.
[01:47:48.708 --> 01:47:49.408]  How's that sound?
[01:47:49.408 --> 01:47:51.528]  Okay, thank you.
[01:47:51.528 --> 01:47:53.148]  Did you want to add anything else?
[01:47:53.148 --> 01:47:55.849]  I did want to ask you about Ukraine.
[01:47:55.849 --> 01:48:02.410]  I got an email on that, and I guess there's... I don't know if there's an epidemic going on in there with the swine flu?
[01:48:03.576 --> 01:48:10.939]  Or if they sprayed something in the air, but it's supposed to be really, really bad over there.
[01:48:10.939 --> 01:48:14.681]  Yes, it's killing... I'm thinking they sprayed something in the air.
[01:48:14.681 --> 01:48:20.403]  Well, Nancy, it's killing a large percentage of people.
[01:48:20.403 --> 01:48:23.245]  As you know, this is in mainstream European news.
[01:48:23.245 --> 01:48:25.345]  It's killing a large percentage of people that get it.
[01:48:25.345 --> 01:48:31.028]  It's a strange, not-seen-before virus, and I'm going to put you on hold and give you Jaron's number, okay?
[01:48:32.278 --> 01:48:32.679]  You're the best.
[01:48:32.679 --> 01:48:35.943]  And please give it to James Traficant in a note saying we support him.
[01:48:35.943 --> 01:48:37.706]  Our listeners are asking for him on.
[01:48:37.706 --> 01:48:38.648]  We'd like to interview him.
[01:48:38.648 --> 01:48:40.030]  Thank you for doing that for us.
[01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:43.515]  And that's how we get so much done as our great listeners.
[01:48:43.515 --> 01:48:44.717]  Going back to the Ukraine.
[01:48:46.567 --> 01:48:57.978]  We know that in the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and several other countries, it was 14 Eastern and Western European nations.
[01:48:57.978 --> 01:49:09.429]  London Guardian reported on it, so did The Telegraph, so did a bunch of Czech Republic articles with medical doctors saying, Baxter Pharmaceutical mixed weaponized
[01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:17.962]  Bird flu in with vaccines, but thank God a lab tested it, found out, and it got stopped.
[01:49:17.962 --> 01:49:23.946]  But there appears, doesn't appear, we know there's a cover-up, but it appears it may be Baxter, we're not sure.
[01:49:23.946 --> 01:49:38.035]  London Telegraph and others reported that in trials of an experimental bird flu vaccine, but no one will say what company it was, that the vaccine maker came into Poland and other, this is last year and this year,
[01:49:38.988 --> 01:49:51.016]  And would pay local health departments to pay homeless people to take the experimental shot, but they told them it was a regular flu shot.
[01:49:51.016 --> 01:50:02.064]  So we know that the local authorities, the officials, not the servants, did this and some of them were arrested in Poland for killing these people.
[01:50:02.064 --> 01:50:04.465]  21 of 100 homeless in one town died.
[01:50:04.465 --> 01:50:07.347]  They did a 100 person study, didn't tell them it was a study, 21 died.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:19.005]  And we know there's all these other weird flu vaccine tests being done all over Eastern and Western Europe.
[01:50:19.005 --> 01:50:27.790]  And so the best way that they like to deliver these live viruses to then mutate and spread is through shots.
[01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:31.432]  What was the first vaccine they gave out a month and a half ago for H1N1?
[01:50:31.432 --> 01:50:32.513]  It was the nasal.
[01:50:32.513 --> 01:50:36.455]  The insert for the vaccine admits it's live.
[01:50:36.455 --> 01:50:37.116]  And it admits.
[01:50:38.482 --> 01:50:42.745]  That it will then breathe in the nasal passages, be sneezed out, and spread.
[01:50:42.745 --> 01:50:45.186]  Now, that's hidden in plain view.
[01:50:45.186 --> 01:50:49.429]  So... In fact, during the break, I want the article with London Telegraph.
[01:50:49.429 --> 01:50:52.371]  Just type, homeless die, bird flu vaccine.
[01:50:52.371 --> 01:50:54.052]  And that'll be London Telegraph.
[01:50:54.052 --> 01:50:54.973]  For anybody that wants to see that.
[01:51:01.758 --> 01:51:03.038]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:51:03.038 --> 01:51:04.859]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:51:04.859 --> 01:51:06.699]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:51:06.699 --> 01:51:11.601]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:51:11.601 --> 01:51:16.622]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[01:51:16.622 --> 01:51:18.582]  Introducing Choose4Health.
[01:51:18.582 --> 01:51:24.124]  Choose4Health brings you 16 powerful ingredients in one delicious chewable for around 75 cents per day.

[01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:02.615]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:08.197]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.197 --> 01:52:13.219]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.219 --> 01:52:18.801]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.801 --> 01:52:23.483]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.025 --> 01:52:31.128]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.128 --> 01:52:32.248]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.248 --> 01:52:35.310]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:38.951]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.951 --> 01:52:42.132]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.132 --> 01:52:45.294]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.294 --> 01:52:45.494]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.494 --> 01:52:45.734]  Remember,
[01:52:54.076 --> 01:52:54.397]  I think so.
[01:53:11.072 --> 01:53:11.593]  We're good to go.
[01:53:27.039 --> 01:53:27.419]  I think so.
[01:53:48.037 --> 01:53:52.060]  For prices, additional products and more information, visit PureBulk.com.
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.881]  That's PureBulk.com.
[01:53:53.881 --> 01:53:54.321]  Or call 406-251-3270.
[01:53:54.321 --> 01:53:54.701]  That's 406-251-3270 today.
[01:54:24.184 --> 01:54:25.485]  We are back live.
[01:54:25.485 --> 01:54:35.513]  Here is one of literally hundreds of articles, but most of them are in German or in Czech or in Polish, but they've been translated into English.
[01:54:35.513 --> 01:54:37.414]  But this is the London Telegraph.
[01:54:37.414 --> 01:54:40.457]  Homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[01:54:42.295 --> 01:54:53.681]  Three Polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu virus.
[01:54:53.681 --> 01:55:04.607]  And then it says that of a hundred people it was given to, well this article says 350 homeless people were given it, 21 died in just one test in one town.
[01:55:05.703 --> 01:55:09.124]  It says 21 people from this center died so far.
[01:55:09.124 --> 01:55:13.165]  So from one homeless center, 21 died of the shot.
[01:55:13.165 --> 01:55:23.587]  And it says that they've indicted and arrested them, but it says an unnamed pharmacological company paid them to do this.
[01:55:23.587 --> 01:55:25.868]  So I just wanted to bring this article back to people.
[01:55:25.868 --> 01:55:28.228]  We're not just up here saying this is happening.
[01:55:28.228 --> 01:55:29.929]  So you see a bunch of people dying in Ukraine?
[01:55:30.931 --> 01:55:33.839]  I bet my bottom dollar they were given a vaccine.
[01:55:33.839 --> 01:55:37.288]  Because in Eastern Europe, the governments are so corrupt, the media is so corrupt.
[01:55:40.455 --> 01:55:42.897]  But a lot of their media is good.
[01:55:42.897 --> 01:55:47.000]  It's just that the system is accustomed to committing these crimes out in the open there.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.261]  And so this is going on.
[01:55:48.261 --> 01:55:50.903]  So I would imagine that's what's happening with the Ukraine right now.
[01:55:50.903 --> 01:56:00.391]  We'll ask medical doctor Rima Labo that and Major General Stubblebine on the other side of this break when we start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:56:00.391 --> 01:56:01.672]  I have a press release here.
[01:56:01.672 --> 01:56:06.696]  Gary Franchi and William Lewis were here in studio again today videotaping the show for their upcoming
[01:56:07.967 --> 01:56:13.290]  Camp FEMA 2 they're making and a film called Don't Tread on Me about the state's rights.
[01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:16.992]  And they need to be able to make their money back to make future films.
[01:56:16.992 --> 01:56:23.196]  And the problem is when you let people make copies of your films for educational, not for self-purposes, they still go out and sell them.
[01:56:23.196 --> 01:56:24.516]  And then it really hurts you.
[01:56:24.516 --> 01:56:28.259]  And it's hurt us, but all I care about is getting the word out.
[01:56:28.259 --> 01:56:36.623]  And there are a few people I've had to go after when it gets too egregious, but I want you to get full of the Republican make copies.
[01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:37.584]  I'm begging you to do it.
[01:56:38.652 --> 01:56:48.040]  And Gary Franchi, of course, headed up getting out America Freedom to Fascism to people, but this is his film, and so they've just written up this press release I have.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:57:00.531]  It says, Breaking Release, William Lewis, Gary Franchi, hereby authorize anyone who purchases a copy from Infowars.com, I didn't ask them to do this, it's just what they wrote, to make copies for friends and family for educational non-commercial purposes.
[01:57:01.292 --> 01:57:04.515]  These copies may not be sold on the internet nor uploaded.
[01:57:04.515 --> 01:57:07.378]  Please purchase an authorized DVD from InfoWars.com.
[01:57:07.378 --> 01:57:08.980]  That's where it's discounted right now.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:12.023]  And help get this important message out to the people of America now.
[01:57:12.023 --> 01:57:13.144]  The time is short.
[01:57:13.144 --> 01:57:16.507]  Signed, William Lewis and Gary Franchi.
[01:57:16.507 --> 01:57:18.709]  So there is that press release for you.
[01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:20.351]  You can get Camp FEMA.
[01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:30.814]  Part one, American Lockdown, featuring myself and many others, that documents the truth about the FEMA camps, at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:57:30.814 --> 01:57:40.681]  And you can get all my previous titles massively discounted when you order them with Follow the Republic.
[01:57:40.681 --> 01:57:43.423]  And that also funds our operations.
[01:57:43.423 --> 01:57:43.904]  We are
[01:57:44.994 --> 01:57:49.496]  The most successful of anybody out there at viral free films online.
[01:57:49.496 --> 01:57:52.837]  Over a hundred million conservatively of my last four films.
[01:57:52.837 --> 01:57:54.417]  Over a hundred million.
[01:57:54.417 --> 01:57:55.218]  People have seen it.
[01:57:55.218 --> 01:57:57.158]  Mainstream media has even reported that.
[01:57:57.158 --> 01:58:01.480]  But I'm not successful at selling them.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:07.302]  But I got some sponsors and other things and I kind of lean on the sponsorship and then people even complain about that.
[01:58:07.302 --> 01:58:13.924]  But that's mainly COINTELPRO folks that would just whine and bitch about being given, you know, the keys of the city on a silver platter.
[01:58:15.765 --> 01:58:19.308]  The point is, do financially support all the independent filmmakers that are out there.
[01:58:19.308 --> 01:58:24.472]  Get Follow the Republic in Canfima right now at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:24.472 --> 01:58:24.632]  888-253-3139.
[01:58:24.632 --> 01:58:26.934]  But most importantly, get Follow the Republic.
[01:58:26.934 --> 01:58:28.555]  It's covering what's happening now.
[01:58:28.555 --> 01:58:30.357]  People are ready to learn the truth.
[01:58:30.357 --> 01:58:31.598]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.078 --> 01:58:48.331]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.677 --> 01:58:59.843]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.843 --> 01:59:03.205]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:03.205 --> 01:59:09.069]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:13.852]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.852 --> 01:59:16.214]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:59:16.374 --> 01:59:16.674]  Thank you.
[01:59:35.307 --> 01:59:39.009]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.

[01:59:53.857 --> 01:59:56.238]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.238 --> 01:59:59.020]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.649 --> 02:00:10.476]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.476 --> 02:00:12.058]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.058 --> 02:00:12.959]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.959 --> 02:00:17.806]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.806 --> 02:00:21.851]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.799 --> 02:00:27.466]  We have reached the halfway point here on this live transmission.
[02:00:27.466 --> 02:00:30.651]  Wednesday, the 4th day of November 2009.
[02:00:30.651 --> 02:00:32.113]  Two hours left.
[02:00:32.113 --> 02:00:37.821]  Major General Stubblebine is our guest and his medical doctor wife.
[02:00:38.939 --> 02:00:41.600]  Rima Labo, we are very honored to have them both here with us.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:48.062]  They have fought Codex Alimentarius and the globalist takeover of our food and supplements.
[02:00:48.062 --> 02:00:53.925]  They have exposed the eugenics operations, the deadliness of the vaccines.
[02:00:53.925 --> 02:00:58.606]  They have a lot of breaking news today that we're gonna have them cover first.
[02:00:58.606 --> 02:01:04.889]  I'm gonna give Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine the floor for the first few segments to get all their info out.
[02:01:04.889 --> 02:01:07.810]  Then I've got my questions, like what are these deaths in Ukraine?
[02:01:08.850 --> 02:01:15.515]  How does that tie in with the other deaths of homeless, with bird flu vaccines in Europe confirmed?
[02:01:15.515 --> 02:01:21.200]  And they won't say what company did this, but that the people that gave the shots, the doctors and nurses have been arrested.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:23.562]  So that ought to be a message to the people doing that in the U.S.
[02:01:23.562 --> 02:01:26.544]  and other countries that are engaging in guinea pig activity.
[02:01:26.544 --> 02:01:33.729]  And we're also going to open the phones up next hour, specifically for our guest, General Stubblebine, you name it.
[02:01:35.912 --> 02:01:39.878]  Dr. Labo got interviewed for Jesse Ventura's upcoming TV show.
[02:01:39.878 --> 02:01:46.688]  I'm also in several of those episodes and later next hour we'll get their take on that and what they thought of the interview they did.
[02:01:46.688 --> 02:01:52.275]  A little bit of inside view into this television series premiering in December and January.
[02:01:52.876 --> 02:01:55.979]  We're going to go to break here in a moment, but I did want to let you know their website.
[02:01:55.979 --> 02:01:59.022]  It's healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:01:59.022 --> 02:02:01.624]  One word, healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:02:01.624 --> 02:02:05.087]  We have links to it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:02:05.087 --> 02:02:09.151]  Dr. Labo, General Stubblebine, great to have you here with us, joining us from Germany.
[02:02:09.821 --> 02:02:10.521]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:10.521 --> 02:02:13.783]  We're delighted to be with you.
[02:02:13.783 --> 02:02:25.728]  We've been attending the 31st session of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, which is referred to for short as CCNFSDU.
[02:02:25.728 --> 02:02:32.351]  It's a genocidal tool if ever there was one, and there's been a lot of confirmation of that.
[02:02:32.891 --> 02:02:45.018]  But right now, and I hope we'll have a chance to talk about this, we're looking at a two-pronged attack, a two-pronged genocidal attack by your friend and mine, the World Health Organization.
[02:02:45.018 --> 02:02:47.800]  It's quite obvious and it's quite scary.
[02:02:50.985 --> 02:03:08.839]  Absolutely, and then I of course want to get the latest breakdown, the overview from the general about this eugenics program, what the whole flu vaccine push is about, the fact that people are in record numbers resisting it, and what you think is next in their game plan.
[02:03:08.839 --> 02:03:16.145]  But we're going to go to break in a moment, but go ahead and start defining the two-pronged attack and what Codex Alimentarius is for those that don't know.
[02:03:16.894 --> 02:03:45.329]  Codex Alimentarius is a United Nations Commission which was created in 1962 at the request of convicted Crimes Against Humanity war criminal Fritz Termier, who was the head of Bayer Pharmaceutical before he became the head of IG Farben, the German civilian war machine arm, financed of course by the usual gang of suspects that we know.
[02:03:46.711 --> 02:04:06.900]  So, when he got out of jail and went back to work as the head of Bayer Pharmaceutical, he called together the other pharmaceutical executives who used to work for him as underlings when he was the head of IG Farben, and he said, hey, let's suggest that the United Nations take over the world food supply.
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.641]  Let's write a letter and suggest that to them.
[02:04:10.219 --> 02:04:16.665]  They wrote that letter, he delivered it in 1952, and the United Nations said, what a cool idea!
[02:04:16.665 --> 02:04:20.989]  And they created the Codex Alimentarius, which means food code.
[02:04:21.747 --> 02:04:33.455]  Commission, which is run jointly by the World Health Organization, WHO, of recent pandemic fame, and by the Food and Agriculture Organization.
[02:04:33.455 --> 02:04:42.921]  Their thrust has been to destroy the integrity of the world's food supply for the sake of pharmaceutical
[02:04:43.562 --> 02:04:47.165]  All right, Dr. Labo, General Stubblebine, stay with us.
[02:04:47.165 --> 02:04:57.956]  We're gonna come back, I'm gonna go over your bios briefly, and then we'll launch into Codex Alimentarius, what they're currently doing, taking over the food supply, and the medicines, and the nutrients, and then we'll get into the flu.
[02:04:57.956 --> 02:04:58.437]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.714 --> 02:05:04.096]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:07.718]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.718 --> 02:05:12.300]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:17.883]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.183 --> 02:05:22.947]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.947 --> 02:05:26.569]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.569 --> 02:05:31.393]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.393 --> 02:05:37.957]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.957 --> 02:05:39.899]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.379 --> 02:05:43.582]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.582 --> 02:05:48.086]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.086 --> 02:05:50.248]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.248 --> 02:05:50.308]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.308 --> 02:05:51.309]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.363]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.363 --> 02:06:09.708]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.708 --> 02:06:11.749]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.749 --> 02:06:16.754]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.754 --> 02:06:17.675]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.915 --> 02:06:19.036]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.036 --> 02:06:20.937]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.937 --> 02:06:21.998]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.998 --> 02:06:24.199]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.199 --> 02:06:25.540]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:27.081]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.081 --> 02:06:32.345]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.345 --> 02:06:35.927]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.927 --> 02:06:39.390]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:40.972]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.972 --> 02:06:41.873]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.873 --> 02:06:42.974]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.974 --> 02:06:43.915]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.915 --> 02:06:44.996]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.996 --> 02:06:48.060]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:50.263]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:50.263 --> 02:06:51.264]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:05.597]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.597 --> 02:07:10.143]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.143 --> 02:07:12.406]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.406 --> 02:07:14.028]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.028 --> 02:07:15.070]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:23.717]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.717 --> 02:07:31.183]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.183 --> 02:07:36.828]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.148 --> 02:07:37.709]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.395 --> 02:08:09.156]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.156 --> 02:08:10.917]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.917 --> 02:08:12.478]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.478 --> 02:08:13.399]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.399 --> 02:08:18.242]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.242 --> 02:08:22.285]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.238 --> 02:08:34.607]  I have shown this article before, but I'm going to show it again because there were hundreds of these stories all over Europe.
[02:08:34.607 --> 02:08:45.038]  Hundreds alone in the Czech Republic where their top doctors came out and said, Baxter Pharmaceutical knowingly put bird flu and tried to put it in the vaccine supply.
[02:08:45.038 --> 02:08:46.460]  There's no way this was an accident.
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:48.421]  And then nothing happened.
[02:08:48.421 --> 02:08:57.688]  Then we learned that bird flu by an unnamed company was mixed in with vaccines all over and given in secret trials to homeless people.
[02:08:57.688 --> 02:09:00.590]  In one homeless shelter, they killed 21 people.
[02:09:00.590 --> 02:09:03.172]  This is the London Telegraph.
[02:09:03.172 --> 02:09:15.262]  Now the reason I raise this is that we have CFR meetings, we've played clips of, where they make fun of us and say there's no mercury, no adverse reactions, no Guillain-Barré's disorder, no sickness, no autoimmune, no deaths.
[02:09:16.479 --> 02:09:28.005]  When every major vaccine always causes this stuff, and when they do have these reactions, they say, well, that's part of the bad reaction, and we expect that to happen, and that's an acceptable loss, collateral damage.
[02:09:28.005 --> 02:09:36.769]  We have Dr. Rima Lebo, who is a top medical doctor joining us, and her husband is Major General Albert N. Stubblebine III, U.S.
[02:09:36.769 --> 02:09:38.630]  Army, retired.
[02:09:38.630 --> 02:09:41.652]  And to go over his bio is just amazing.
[02:09:42.922 --> 02:09:53.912]  He was known as an out-of-the-box thinker, who was the head of special forces, the head of different intelligence groups.
[02:09:53.912 --> 02:09:55.993]  Let me just read the bio so I don't get it wrong.
[02:09:55.993 --> 02:10:02.779]  And then for an hour and 50 minutes, we've got both of them live from Germany joining us today with their fighting Codex Alimentarius.
[02:10:02.779 --> 02:10:06.903]  And we'll recap what that is, get into the flu, the swine flu, the bird flu.
[02:10:07.944 --> 02:10:16.803]  How school children everywhere are being forcibly inoculated and the talking point when parents get mad or the kids go to the hospital, that's New York Daily News, is oops.
[02:10:18.123 --> 02:10:19.444]  Bert is a graduate of the U.S.
[02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:21.966]  Military Academy, West Point, Class of 52.
[02:10:21.966 --> 02:10:24.107]  He enjoyed a distinguished 32 career in the U.S.
[02:10:24.107 --> 02:10:24.327]  Army.
[02:10:24.327 --> 02:10:28.890]  He retired as the Commanding General of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command.
[02:10:28.890 --> 02:10:30.812]  Prior to his assignment, he commanded the U.S.
[02:10:30.812 --> 02:10:33.433]  Army Electronics Research and Development Command.
[02:10:33.433 --> 02:10:36.335]  During his active duty career, he commanded soldiers at every level.
[02:10:36.335 --> 02:10:42.460]  After his retirement, he served as a VP for Intelligence Systems, BDM, a major defense contractor.
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:52.625]  He brought these experiences to leading-edge medical research and development in collaboration with his wife, Rima Labo, and then the bio just goes on and on and on.
[02:10:52.625 --> 02:11:04.792]  But all these decades of work and research, even being the head of intelligence, it finally all came into view for him in the last six, seven years, and he agrees, in past interviews, it is the endgame.
[02:11:04.792 --> 02:11:10.996]  Mass extermination, a total police state grid to carry this out, and Dr. Labo, who's treated heads of state
[02:11:11.806 --> 02:11:14.207]  I don't know where to start with everything that's happening.
[02:11:14.207 --> 02:11:15.667]  Again, you're at Codex Alimentarius.
[02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:16.168]  Hit that first.
[02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:16.608]  What we're facing.
[02:11:36.215 --> 02:11:43.141]  Then the flu, the forced inoculations that are going on covertly at an ambient level being turned up slowly.
[02:11:43.141 --> 02:11:46.985]  Is this all a command and control beta test for future pandemics?
[02:11:46.985 --> 02:11:51.529]  Dr. Rima Labo and of course, Major General Albert N. Stubblebine III, welcome.
[02:11:52.742 --> 02:11:55.643]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:11:55.643 --> 02:12:13.012]  Let's finish talking about Codex, which I think is a long-term genocidal weapon of the globalists, and then link it to the vaccines, which is a shorter-term, immediate assault.
[02:12:13.012 --> 02:12:21.296]  But that's against the backdrop of the long-term poisoning of the immune system of the people of the planet.
[02:12:21.796 --> 02:12:23.837]  Now, those are very, very strong words.
[02:12:23.837 --> 02:12:28.479]  Happily, the people who listen to your show are used to those strong words.
[02:12:28.479 --> 02:12:40.164]  Often, when we talk about this, people glaze over and go dumb, but I think your listeners are prepared for this information, and that's terrific.
[02:12:40.164 --> 02:12:41.705]  We are at the Codex meeting.
[02:12:42.296 --> 02:12:43.857]  We're good to go.
[02:12:59.428 --> 02:12:59.708]  Thank you.
[02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:24.650]  A program to limit nutrients, which we in the United States are used to having at any dosage that we want.
[02:13:24.650 --> 02:13:32.592]  High-potency nutrients are, for instance, part of how I practice medicine and how I live, as a matter of fact.
[02:13:32.592 --> 02:13:38.774]  And they are for about 131 million people in the United States as well.
[02:13:38.774 --> 02:13:43.836]  Today and yesterday, the United States delegate, Barbara Schneeman,
[02:13:45.043 --> 02:14:05.492]  At this meeting, made it clear once again that the FDA, and she is the head of the Dietary Supplements Office at the FDA, the FDA is perfectly comfortable working with an international body of unelected bureaucrats to eliminate high-potency nutrients.
[02:14:05.492 --> 02:14:13.416]  That means to bring down your maximum permissible upper limit of, for instance, vitamin C,
[02:14:14.673 --> 02:14:15.533]  We're good to go.
[02:14:42.245 --> 02:14:42.565]  No, I don't.
[02:15:03.607 --> 02:15:19.926]  Milligrams per day, which is an astounding amount of the neurotoxic, endocrine toxic, bone toxic poison, which makes people sheep-like, or four milligrams per day.
[02:15:19.926 --> 02:15:24.311]  These are astounding amounts, and Dr. Schneeman,
[02:15:25.606 --> 02:15:52.065]  In a little piece of theater that I did a video about and that you can read about at our website healthfreedomusa.org and our blogs and blasts that we put out during the Codex meeting on a daily basis, Dr. Schneeman said, you know, I think that since nutrients are food and they are under U.S.
[02:15:52.065 --> 02:15:53.426]  law, then the
[02:15:55.268 --> 02:16:02.552]  Nutrient upper limit should apply to them as well on a global basis.
[02:16:02.552 --> 02:16:05.393]  That's in violation of U.S.
[02:16:05.393 --> 02:16:06.274]  law.
[02:16:06.274 --> 02:16:16.239]  So the game is to make sure that nutrients are available in such low doses that they can do no good.
[02:16:16.239 --> 02:16:17.120]  Why?
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:19.461]  Well, think about this for a moment.
[02:16:19.949 --> 02:16:25.658]  The World Health Organization says that the non-communicable, preventable diseases of
[02:16:30.339 --> 02:16:36.040]  ...are cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and obesity.
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:46.403]  Those five diseases are the principal killers of the developed world, and increasingly the developing world, and they're also the principal money makers.
[02:16:46.403 --> 02:16:59.146]  So, if you mandate global malnutrition, which this does, the nutrient reference value, upper limit, mandates global malnutrition, under nutrition,
[02:16:59.787 --> 02:17:14.481]  And then you have the pharmaceutical company making lots and lots of money from the chronic degenerative diseases of undernutrition while people die from their deadly treatments.
[02:17:14.481 --> 02:17:18.664]  What you have is depopulation for a profit.
[02:17:18.664 --> 02:17:19.265]  Okay.
[02:17:19.265 --> 02:17:21.867]  And that is, in essence, Codex.
[02:17:21.867 --> 02:17:23.509]  But then you segue
[02:17:24.289 --> 02:17:27.211]  Right over to the next W.H.O.
[02:17:27.211 --> 02:17:29.653]  program, which is vaccine.
[02:17:29.653 --> 02:17:32.396]  Go ahead.
[02:17:32.396 --> 02:17:39.361]  Before she segues, let me just add a little tidbit to all of this.
[02:17:39.361 --> 02:17:49.630]  Because everything, you know, if it were presented to you as a genocidal program, you would say, what?
[02:17:49.630 --> 02:17:52.072]  You'd get on your hind legs and you'd scream.
[02:17:52.685 --> 02:17:55.527]  And you wouldn't stand for it.
[02:17:55.527 --> 02:18:03.212]  However, all of this was done by saying, oh, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
[02:18:03.212 --> 02:18:13.418]  All we're doing is putting these values on the labels so that you will know what you're getting.
[02:18:14.022 --> 02:18:17.247]  And it will have no impact at all.
[02:18:17.247 --> 02:18:22.293]  You'll just have the knowledge so that you can select what you want.
[02:18:22.293 --> 02:18:23.215]  As a consumer?
[02:18:23.215 --> 02:18:25.458]  Yeah, as a consumer.
[02:18:25.458 --> 02:18:27.280]  And what they don't tell you is...
[02:18:29.447 --> 02:18:39.529]  The plan eventually will be that the only way that you can do international trade with all of this is to be under these limits.
[02:18:39.529 --> 02:18:42.890]  And they do tell each other, they just don't tell the public.
[02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:52.232]  They don't tell the public that eventually, in order to do international trade, you will have to live by these limits.
[02:18:52.814 --> 02:19:05.880]  And therefore there will be no international trade of anything bigger than what these limits that they've set at this meeting.
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:18.366]  But what happens is that the United States government on October 11, 1994, the FDA, announced in the Federal Register that it is committed to harmonizing
[02:19:19.968 --> 02:19:24.571]  And that needs to have the first four letters capitalized, H-A-R-M.
[02:19:24.571 --> 02:19:31.575]  It is committed to harmonizing with the Codex Standards whether or not they violate U.S.
[02:19:31.575 --> 02:19:33.797]  standards.
[02:19:33.797 --> 02:19:39.801]  We're going to have these limits set for us by the S.E.A.
[02:19:39.801 --> 02:19:41.502]  in spite of the fact that U.S.
[02:19:41.502 --> 02:19:43.043]  law prohibits that.
[02:19:43.891 --> 02:19:45.694]  Doctor, we've got a break.
[02:19:45.694 --> 02:19:47.096]  General, we've got a break.
[02:19:47.096 --> 02:19:53.505]  We're going to come back and continue and then get into the other side of the pincer, the vaccines.
[02:19:53.505 --> 02:19:57.250]  I hope people realize the magnitude of what they're hearing.
[02:19:57.250 --> 02:19:58.031]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.031 --> 02:19:58.492]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.105 --> 02:20:06.406]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[02:20:06.406 --> 02:20:07.906]  It's a scary world we live in.
[02:20:07.906 --> 02:20:12.267]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[02:20:12.267 --> 02:20:15.967]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[02:20:15.967 --> 02:20:23.749]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[02:20:23.749 --> 02:20:27.729]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[02:20:27.729 --> 02:20:31.630]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.
[02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:32.290]  We're good to go.
[02:21:02.486 --> 02:21:04.827]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[02:21:38.919 --> 02:21:39.339]  I think so.
[02:22:00.905 --> 02:22:03.086]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:22:03.086 --> 02:22:03.947]  Spy on me?
[02:22:03.947 --> 02:22:04.267]  Yeah.
[02:22:04.267 --> 02:22:09.310]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:10.930]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:22:10.930 --> 02:22:11.691]  Startpage?
[02:22:11.691 --> 02:22:12.111]  Yeah.
[02:22:12.111 --> 02:22:13.192]  Startpage.com.
[02:22:13.192 --> 02:22:16.153]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:22:16.153 --> 02:22:20.035]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:22:20.035 --> 02:22:22.897]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:22:23.177 --> 02:22:25.799]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:22:25.799 --> 02:22:27.380]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:27.680]  Right!

[02:22:31.563 --> 02:22:32.924]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:22:32.924 --> 02:22:36.767]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.

[02:22:55.145 --> 02:22:56.748]  That's StartPage.com
[02:23:00.796 --> 02:23:04.359]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[02:23:04.359 --> 02:23:13.988]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[02:23:13.988 --> 02:23:20.835]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[02:23:21.035 --> 02:23:34.558]  If you are ready to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[02:23:34.558 --> 02:23:40.340]  Here is what one satisfied customer had to say about Heart and Body Extract regarding his angina pain.
[02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:43.540]  I haven't had an angina pain since I've been on it.
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:45.901]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[02:23:45.901 --> 02:23:50.722]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me, and that can do so much for other people.
[02:23:50.782 --> 02:23:52.083]  I remember four years ago, nationally,
[02:24:18.243 --> 02:24:28.508]  The news reported and local news reported that the federal government had done two studies finding that mercury was actually good for children's brains.
[02:24:28.508 --> 02:24:33.490]  And we played those video clips off the news many times here.
[02:24:33.490 --> 02:24:45.295]  Then I was at the store and I'd heard that since they had said mercury was now a supplement that they were putting it in products and I found a whole bunch of products
[02:24:47.714 --> 02:24:51.396]  Where on the back it says mercury.
[02:24:51.396 --> 02:25:05.264]  And right there on this product it says mercury listed as one of the minerals when it's a heavy metal.
[02:25:05.264 --> 02:25:07.085]  And I found a lot of products doing this.
[02:25:07.085 --> 02:25:14.449]  And they have said, and I've heard Dr. Dina Dell, who's their spokesman on radio, he says, we've interviewed him, that vitamins are bad for you.
[02:25:14.449 --> 02:25:16.190]  You can hear him any weekday saying it.
[02:25:17.673 --> 02:25:21.694]  Saying that we all need to not take them, and that people are crazy.
[02:25:21.694 --> 02:25:26.295]  So, this is the universe inverted into pure insanity.
[02:25:26.295 --> 02:25:36.558]  And Codex Alimentarius, it's just another power grab, like private groups wanting to pass a carbon tax, saying carbon dioxide's bad, when that's what plants breathe.
[02:25:36.558 --> 02:25:38.738]  We use oxygen, they use carbon dioxide.
[02:25:38.738 --> 02:25:40.459]  They put off oxygen, we breathe it.
[02:25:40.459 --> 02:25:42.819]  We put off carbon dioxide, they then absorb that.
[02:25:42.819 --> 02:25:45.200]  That's the carbon cycle, the life cycle.
[02:25:46.557 --> 02:25:49.618]  And it's the boldness and they're taking over the banking right now.
[02:25:49.618 --> 02:25:51.738]  They're taking over the local police right now.
[02:25:51.738 --> 02:25:55.019]  They're taking over the health care right now to carry out eugenics.
[02:25:55.019 --> 02:25:57.119]  They're taking over the vitamins and the food.
[02:25:57.119 --> 02:26:00.820]  They're openly announcing they may shut down the web during emergencies.
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:03.201]  That's Associated Press today.
[02:26:03.201 --> 02:26:08.162]  They really are moving and they're forcibly inoculating school children nationwide.
[02:26:08.162 --> 02:26:08.962]  And when kids drop
[02:26:09.762 --> 02:26:23.002]  on the ground have convulsions they say that's the only time it makes it in the news and they say oh we made a mistake this is a short segment going back to General Stubblebine and then back to Dr. Labo who's there to continue with the vaccines but to go over all of this
[02:26:24.252 --> 02:26:38.504]  General, the overarching program we're witnessing here, the takeover by the globalists at every front, their plan to depopulate, can you give us your wide spectrum analysis of what we're facing?
[02:26:38.504 --> 02:26:42.567]  Because the evidence is, and the on-the-ground intelligence is,
[02:26:43.368 --> 02:26:46.409]  Well certainly, if you think about it in terms of the principles of war,
[02:27:13.434 --> 02:27:17.716]  One of those principles is called surprise.
[02:27:17.716 --> 02:27:28.599]  And so suddenly, here they are, hitting you from all sides, and you're not sure which way you need to duck in order to not get hit.
[02:27:28.599 --> 02:27:34.761]  The second thing that, or another one of the principles of war, is called mass.
[02:27:34.761 --> 02:27:39.203]  And so, and what that means is, you put all of your force
[02:27:40.178 --> 02:27:44.921]  On the weakest part of the enemy's force.
[02:27:44.921 --> 02:27:47.223]  And so, what are they doing?
[02:27:47.223 --> 02:27:58.210]  They're hitting you from every single solitary direction with a mass of different kinds of things, and how do you then expect to fight back?
[02:27:58.210 --> 02:28:08.216]  You have trouble because you're ducking from every different direction, and you're trying to cover yourself at one, and you're getting hit from another direction.
[02:28:08.723 --> 02:28:16.826]  And General, as you just said, they're targeting the weakest, the doctors, the nurses, the people being threatened with their jobs, the school children.
[02:28:16.826 --> 02:28:21.769]  They, in all 50 states we're getting reports, are forcibly inoculating.
[02:28:21.769 --> 02:28:25.230]  In plain view, the first vaccine is the live nasal.
[02:28:25.230 --> 02:28:31.573]  The insert admits that will then breed it, incubate it, to spread the real influenza outbreak.
[02:28:33.434 --> 02:28:40.038]  In military terminology, what is it when they just operate flagrantly in plain view as well?
[02:28:40.038 --> 02:28:42.720]  Well, it's the... How about tyranny?
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:45.242]  Yeah, tyranny.
[02:28:45.242 --> 02:28:51.886]  You know, when you have all of the cards, or you think you have all of the cards, you can do that.
[02:28:51.886 --> 02:28:54.948]  You can do a frontal assault.
[02:28:54.948 --> 02:29:00.272]  The Soviets used to try it, or used to practice it in great length.
[02:29:01.574 --> 02:29:02.375]  All of the time.
[02:29:02.375 --> 02:29:24.245]  I can remember as a young lieutenant in Germany where the Soviets would put their entire army on the line in a huge mass and move right up to the border and expect us to react.
[02:29:24.245 --> 02:29:28.827]  And then at the last minute they would do a right flank or a left flank and go away.
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:34.402]  Well, these people are doing exactly the same thing, except they're not going away.
[02:29:34.402 --> 02:29:42.684]  By the way, Alex, the name of the company whose vaccines killed the vagrants in Poland was Novartis.
[02:29:42.684 --> 02:29:43.704]  Ah, we've discovered that.
[02:29:43.704 --> 02:29:44.705]  Okay, tell us about that.
[02:29:44.705 --> 02:29:47.986]  We'll get into part two, the vaccines, and how we fight it.
[02:29:47.986 --> 02:29:51.687]  Straight ahead.
[02:29:51.687 --> 02:29:53.067]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.067 --> 02:29:55.608]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.608 --> 02:29:58.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.879 --> 02:30:07.885]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:07.885 --> 02:30:09.967]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:31:00.677 --> 02:31:05.220]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.220 --> 02:31:06.140]  Number one.
[02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:09.563]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.563 --> 02:31:10.423]  Number two.
[02:31:10.423 --> 02:31:15.326]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.326 --> 02:31:16.067]  It's true.
[02:31:16.067 --> 02:31:20.930]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.930 --> 02:31:21.770]  Number three.
[02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:25.353]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.353 --> 02:31:29.055]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.255 --> 02:31:30.056]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.056 --> 02:31:32.818]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.818 --> 02:31:36.482]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.482 --> 02:31:37.283]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.283 --> 02:31:41.426]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.426 --> 02:31:46.191]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:33.368 --> 02:32:35.449]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.449 --> 02:32:37.209]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.209 --> 02:32:39.730]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.730 --> 02:32:44.451]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.451 --> 02:32:48.173]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:48.173 --> 02:32:51.294]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:51.294 --> 02:32:53.194]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:53.194 --> 02:32:55.295]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:26.841]  The enemy is moving on every front.
[02:33:26.841 --> 02:33:29.244]  They're announcing registration of guns.
[02:33:29.244 --> 02:33:34.689]  They're announcing the feds are going to tax your car with GPS by the mile on top of gas taxes.
[02:33:34.689 --> 02:33:42.476]  They're announcing a new private bank of the world is setting up quote global governance and you will pay your carbon taxes to private interest.
[02:33:44.849 --> 02:33:46.670]  They're just moving on every front.
[02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:48.691]  Major General Stubblebine is our guest.
[02:33:48.691 --> 02:33:52.252]  His wife, Dr. Rima Labo, medical doctor.
[02:33:52.252 --> 02:33:58.375]  We're going to be talking about what's happening with the flu shots, what they believe from their research is behind it.
[02:33:58.375 --> 02:34:03.657]  And we're also going to get into these deaths from different flu vaccine trials in Europe.
[02:34:03.657 --> 02:34:05.257]  Also deaths now in the U.S.
[02:34:05.257 --> 02:34:06.878]  and a lot of illnesses that are confirmed.
[02:34:07.378 --> 02:34:08.079]  The FDA admits.
[02:34:08.079 --> 02:34:11.342]  Oh, that's normal that some people will die or have convulsions.
[02:34:11.342 --> 02:34:17.729]  We're going to be discussing all that and what the overall master plan is and how to fight back against it and your calls next hour.
[02:34:17.729 --> 02:34:23.395]  Before I go any further, I want to thank some of today's sponsors that have made this radio show possible.
[02:34:23.395 --> 02:34:25.297]  One of them is survivalseedbank.com.
[02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:32.124]  The smart thing to do is to grow non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds and to get involved growing gardens.
[02:34:32.124 --> 02:34:32.625]  You'll love it.
[02:34:32.625 --> 02:34:33.986]  Your children will love it.
[02:34:33.986 --> 02:34:34.667]  It's healthy.
[02:34:34.667 --> 02:34:35.288]  It's fun.
[02:34:35.288 --> 02:34:36.389]  It's human.
[02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:44.156]  It's getting away from the television set and away from the Prozac and Ritalin and the GMO food and just getting back to nature.
[02:34:44.156 --> 02:34:48.640]  And you're not going to get off the grid overnight, but the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:34:49.361 --> 02:34:53.505]  And growing your own garden is a couple hundred miles on that thousand mile journey.
[02:34:53.505 --> 02:34:56.267]  So I hope you'll visit the folks at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:34:56.267 --> 02:34:58.269]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:34:58.269 --> 02:35:01.952]  They have high quality, low cost, non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds.
[02:35:01.952 --> 02:35:02.933]  You can also give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:35:02.933 --> 02:35:04.314]  That's 877-327-0365 or survivalseedbank.com.
[02:35:04.314 --> 02:35:04.594]  One other
[02:35:13.413 --> 02:35:16.996]  Sponsor I wanna tell you about is Diginet.net.
[02:35:16.996 --> 02:35:24.981]  They have sunglasses cameras that have audio and video and a tiny chip in them that you can put in your computer that gets video and audio.
[02:35:24.981 --> 02:35:26.402]  They have hidden pins.
[02:35:26.402 --> 02:35:40.752]  What's great about these is they're inexpensive, they work well, you press one button, you have it in your car, have it in your briefcase, police pull you over, secret police, they're trying to push vaccines, go into the nurse's office, they forcibly injected your kid, record them admitting it,
[02:35:41.971 --> 02:35:45.153]  There is so much you can do with these to protect yourself.
[02:35:45.153 --> 02:35:48.856]  Fight back against Big Brother with the surveillance system.
[02:35:48.856 --> 02:35:50.417]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[02:35:50.417 --> 02:35:51.818]  Fight fire with fire.
[02:35:51.818 --> 02:35:54.661]  This is an important weapon system in the Info War.
[02:35:54.661 --> 02:35:58.283]  Diginet.net online or give them a call at 888-344-6681.
[02:36:02.426 --> 02:36:03.107]  344-6681.
[02:36:03.107 --> 02:36:04.628]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:36:04.628 --> 02:36:06.329]  Diginet.net.
[02:36:06.329 --> 02:36:12.052]  Going back to our guests, I just want to mention their websites are healthfreedomusa.org, healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:36:12.052 --> 02:36:15.454]  Incredible information on that site.
[02:36:15.454 --> 02:36:17.976]  They also take action against Codex Alimentarius.
[02:36:17.976 --> 02:36:20.257]  They take action against the vaccines.
[02:36:20.257 --> 02:36:23.940]  They have solutions to fight back and they've been instrumental
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:24.660]  I think?
[02:36:43.962 --> 02:36:44.422]  Mentioning
[02:36:58.755 --> 02:37:01.537]  They arrested the Polish doctors and nurses.
[02:37:01.537 --> 02:37:12.525]  They've charged them with taking money from an unnamed pharmacological company to tell the homeless people that it was a regular flu shot and then it killed them.
[02:37:12.525 --> 02:37:16.328]  And it turned out this happened in other countries but only Poland prosecuted.
[02:37:16.328 --> 02:37:16.929]  How can
[02:37:18.447 --> 02:37:27.377]  The doctors be prosecuted for giving the shot and being paid to do it and lying, but how is the company, and I haven't seen that in the news, how do you know it's Norvitis?
[02:37:27.377 --> 02:37:31.062]  I mean, I'm not doubting you, but enlighten us.
[02:37:31.769 --> 02:37:41.297]  Well, we know very well that information disappears after it's put out and people begin accessing it.
[02:37:41.297 --> 02:37:49.745]  In the very early days of this story, quite some number of months ago, and by the way, 11 people died immediately and then
[02:37:50.345 --> 02:37:58.751]  When the rest of the people who became very ill suddenly were taken to the hospital, at least 21 of them died.
[02:37:58.751 --> 02:38:03.154]  And this was in a very small population of people, about 300 people.
[02:38:03.154 --> 02:38:05.976]  So we're talking about a humongous death rate.
[02:38:05.976 --> 02:38:06.937]  No, you're right.
[02:38:06.937 --> 02:38:12.901]  It says at one center, 350 were given it, 21 died at the hospital, and 11 others before that.
[02:38:12.901 --> 02:38:13.201]  So that's 32.
[02:38:14.762 --> 02:38:15.742]  That's right.
[02:38:15.742 --> 02:38:21.364]  That's a huge death rate, and we don't know how many other people died longer term.
[02:38:21.364 --> 02:38:34.588]  Well, in the very early days of this story, it was made clear that it was the Novartis vaccine, the very same Novartis vaccine, by the way, that the United States was stockpiling.
[02:38:34.588 --> 02:38:42.931]  And so, once that information began to be circulated widely, the name of the company disappeared.
[02:38:43.416 --> 02:38:45.338]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:38:45.338 --> 02:39:02.595]  If Bayer Pharmaceutical, with over a million ampoules of Factor VIII, convicted in court, France indicted the officials, nobody else did in Australia, the U.S., and other countries, it came out in court, MSNBC's even reported, as you know, the audience, that they knowingly put AIDS, HIV, and Hepatitis in it.
[02:39:02.595 --> 02:39:04.456]  They didn't just let it go out over a decade.
[02:39:05.277 --> 02:39:12.359]  If you or I got caught giving a million people HIV or hepatitis, we'd go to the electric chair or lethal injection.
[02:39:12.359 --> 02:39:17.921]  When they do it, they get government contracts and are called our saviors.
[02:39:17.921 --> 02:39:25.343]  Doctor, I want your comment on how they get away with this, and then I want General Stubblebine's breakdown on the overall master plan, what we're facing here.
[02:39:27.176 --> 02:39:36.319]  My comment is that the way they do it is by the deepest, most extraordinarily enormous level of corruption.
[02:39:36.319 --> 02:39:40.020]  We like to think of other countries around the world as corrupt.
[02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:53.204]  We like to point our fingers at countries like Thailand and Indonesia and African countries and say, look how corrupt they are, not realizing that the most profound corruption
[02:39:53.704 --> 02:39:54.525]  We're good.
[02:40:14.662 --> 02:40:22.927]  The Natural Solutions Foundation Stop the Shot lawsuit will be heard in Washington, D.C.
[02:40:22.927 --> 02:40:35.655]  We are suing the FDA to prevent them from releasing any more of their untested, unsafe, uninsurable, unnecessary H1N1 vaccine.
[02:40:35.655 --> 02:40:37.576]  And what we have is a world
[02:40:38.317 --> 02:40:39.899]  We're good.
[02:40:46.318 --> 02:41:04.046]  From the people who are dropping dead, the people in Germany who are collapsing and dying from the Pandremix shot, and Pandremix is one of the vaccines that the FDA has illegally approved.
[02:41:04.046 --> 02:41:11.629]  I thought I would take a moment, Alex, to read you what GlaxoSmithKline admits to the side effects
[02:41:12.332 --> 02:41:12.752]  Absolutely.
[02:41:12.752 --> 02:41:14.574]  I want to do that and I also want to point out
[02:41:30.134 --> 02:41:41.439]  That the mainstream media in public schools and colleges and in government facilities is handing out a federally written fact sheet that says there is no mercury.
[02:41:41.439 --> 02:41:45.041]  Paul Watts has written an article about this linking to it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:41:45.041 --> 02:41:45.961]  There is no mercury.
[02:41:45.961 --> 02:41:48.062]  It cannot cause neurological disorders.
[02:41:48.062 --> 02:41:49.883]  It cannot cause Guillain-Barré.
[02:41:49.883 --> 02:41:50.764]  It cannot cause
[02:41:51.744 --> 02:41:51.964]  All right.
[02:42:07.333 --> 02:42:12.735]  How do they just lie and say there's no mercury when it's on all the inserts?
[02:42:12.735 --> 02:42:17.996]  I mean, it's like they're trying to discredit themselves, or do they have just complete disdain for the public?
[02:42:17.996 --> 02:42:27.639]  I guess if they're going to try to ban people getting even medium levels of vitamin C and vitamin D, I guess, you know, they say vitamins are bad, but mercury is good.
[02:42:27.639 --> 02:42:30.380]  I mean, it's like I've woken up in Alice in Wonderland.
[02:42:31.187 --> 02:42:31.887]  Exactly.
[02:42:31.887 --> 02:42:46.071]  Alex, there was a story in all the media a couple of days ago saying the women who got mercury in their vaccines while they were pregnant had healthier babies, had larger babies.
[02:42:46.071 --> 02:42:50.632]  And I thought, my God, Alice in Wonderland has nothing on this.
[02:42:50.632 --> 02:42:52.012]  This is callous
[02:42:52.552 --> 02:42:54.414]  Thank you for having me.
[02:43:11.332 --> 02:43:20.259]  Doctor, they're now, I can go to Whole Foods or I can go to other vitamin shops in Austin and many of the products have mercury in them now.
[02:43:20.259 --> 02:43:23.242]  I mean, we're now entering a vortex of insanity.
[02:43:23.242 --> 02:43:26.705]  I think that's a good way to put it.
[02:43:26.705 --> 02:43:35.612]  Let me read to you what GlaxoSmithKline says on his package insert about the Arapanrix
[02:43:36.272 --> 02:43:54.013]  Which is the same as the Tendermix, which has now been banned in Switzerland, by the way, for children, pregnant women, and the chronically ill, the very same people that it is approved for, without any testing, of course, in the United States.
[02:43:54.312 --> 02:43:55.772]  Let me stop you again.
[02:43:55.772 --> 02:43:57.173]  That is key.
[02:43:57.173 --> 02:44:04.976]  They are targeting and pushing the vaccine on the very people that their own inserts admit shouldn't take it.
[02:44:04.976 --> 02:44:06.736]  Now, I mean, that is crime.
[02:44:06.736 --> 02:44:07.596]  Go ahead.
[02:44:07.596 --> 02:44:21.401]  And understand that the high levels of squalene, even the vaccines that do not have squalene, will be administered, unless our suit succeeds tomorrow, will be administered with admixed
[02:44:22.119 --> 02:44:23.161]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:44:23.161 --> 02:44:24.502]  That's the bait and switch.
[02:44:24.502 --> 02:44:28.908]  So you're saying they draw up the vaccine and then go to a bottle of squalene with it?
[02:44:38.121 --> 02:44:39.181]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:39.181 --> 02:44:45.524]  And by the way, that happens to violate the FDA's own good manufacturing practices.
[02:44:45.524 --> 02:44:51.866]  That in itself, just that little trick that we're talking about right now, is illegal in the United States.
[02:44:51.866 --> 02:44:53.667]  Unbelievable.
[02:44:53.667 --> 02:44:55.007]  Unbelievable.
[02:44:55.007 --> 02:44:57.388]  Okay, go over what their own insert says.
[02:44:58.015 --> 02:45:15.162]  Their own inserts say that in one person in a thousand you will have allergic reactions leading, I'm reading from their own insert, allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure which if untreated may lead to shock.
[02:45:15.162 --> 02:45:16.843]  That's one in a thousand.
[02:45:16.843 --> 02:45:24.026]  Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases except for the fact
[02:45:24.526 --> 02:45:37.390]  That the people who can now administer it under emergency regulations are pharmacists and cab drivers and just about anybody who don't have these things available.
[02:45:37.390 --> 02:45:53.596]  They say that you can have convulsions, severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves, low bloodlet platelet count, which can result in bleeding or bruising in a population of 300 million people according to their own calculations.
[02:45:54.076 --> 02:45:58.177]  And we know, of course, that they're underestimating the dangers.
[02:45:58.177 --> 02:46:03.019]  We're talking about 30,000 people to whom this is likely to happen.
[02:46:03.019 --> 02:46:06.120]  Now, very rare, they say, one in 10,000.
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:07.080]  But it's not rare.
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:16.763]  We're learning about, in every case, the kids being forcibly inoculated because they're collapsing and having convulsions and having the blood pressure problem.
[02:46:16.763 --> 02:46:18.784]  This is devastating.
[02:46:18.784 --> 02:46:21.185]  There is, in epidemiology,
[02:46:22.105 --> 02:46:28.269]  If something happens in one in a thousand people, it's not called rare, it's called common.
[02:46:28.269 --> 02:46:29.810]  It's called an epidemic.
[02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:36.334]  They have changed the meaning of the word rare just as one of the casualties along the way.
[02:46:36.334 --> 02:46:42.999]  Very rare, which they say is in 10,000 people, and again, that's not very rare in a large population.
[02:46:43.570 --> 02:46:52.192]  Vasculitis, which means inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pains, and kidney problems and lead to death.
[02:46:52.192 --> 02:46:59.674]  Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis, which is essentially meningitis.
[02:46:59.674 --> 02:47:02.234]  Neuritis, an inflammation of the nerve.
[02:47:02.234 --> 02:47:05.095]  And a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barre.
[02:47:05.862 --> 02:47:06.342]  Right.
[02:47:06.342 --> 02:47:09.764]  Now this, they say, is in 1 in 10,000 people.
[02:47:09.764 --> 02:47:12.065]  In fact, it will be much more common.
[02:47:12.065 --> 02:47:19.769]  So we have nurses and EMTs and teachers pulling up squalene.
[02:47:20.764 --> 02:47:21.445]  I don't
[02:47:40.194 --> 02:47:46.920]  That in the Army studies in the 90s and in 2002, they had to suspend the anthrax shots and others.
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:53.545]  They proved that the squalene was causing the brain swelling, the heart attacks, the inflammation.
[02:47:53.545 --> 02:48:03.012]  So they know that by illegally putting squalene into this, this is... Why shouldn't the nurses just inject the little kids with cyanide?
[02:48:03.012 --> 02:48:06.275]  Well, they... Then it was called Gulf War Syndrome.
[02:48:06.275 --> 02:48:09.678]  Now it should be called Sibelius Syndrome, but it's a little bit worse.
[02:48:11.071 --> 02:48:18.296]  The dose, first of all, the injection of even one or two molecules of squalene can cause these problems.
[02:48:18.296 --> 02:48:22.820]  So let's be very clear that there is no safe dose of injected squalene.
[02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:34.410]  Now, the dose that they are putting in, and remember, the CDC purchased a half a billion dollars worth of injectable squalene.
[02:48:34.410 --> 02:48:37.112]  And they've got uneducated people injecting people.
[02:48:37.588 --> 02:48:38.868]  And it's illegal.
[02:48:38.868 --> 02:48:40.969]  It's an illegal, unapproved drug.
[02:48:40.969 --> 02:48:46.430]  But that's why Obama declared the emergency, so he could give the illegal drug.
[02:48:46.430 --> 02:48:57.453]  Well, actually, when he declared the emergency, they already had the emergency use authorization to give the illegal drug that they'd given themselves permission for.
[02:48:57.453 --> 02:49:00.014]  The emergency is even worse than that.
[02:49:00.014 --> 02:49:01.394]  The emergency hands
[02:49:01.834 --> 02:49:12.801]  He handed control of, essentially, the country over to Kathleen Sebelius, who can then, at her discretion, declare martial law.
[02:49:12.801 --> 02:49:18.384]  She can call a lockdown, and she doesn't need anybody else involved.
[02:49:18.384 --> 02:49:26.589]  So he handed to a non-elected, appointed official, he handed the control of this country's future
[02:49:27.069 --> 02:49:33.916]  With that devastatingly insane health emergency of October 23rd.
[02:49:33.916 --> 02:49:41.324]  But back to the squalene, which they already have given themselves the right to inject under emergency use authorization.
[02:49:41.324 --> 02:49:45.508]  And by the way, that's part of what we're suing to stop tomorrow.
[02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:47.010]  If you care about this,
[02:49:48.254 --> 02:49:56.450]  I would suggest strongly that you go to healthfreedomusa.org and make as big a donation as you can.
[02:49:56.450 --> 02:49:58.674]  A recurring donation would be nice.
[02:49:58.674 --> 02:50:00.297]  And let it end in the number 6.
[02:50:01.348 --> 02:50:08.314]  So that we know that it's earmarked for the legal funds, because if we prevail, the FDA is going to appeal.
[02:50:08.314 --> 02:50:11.516]  If we don't prevail, we're going to appeal.
[02:50:11.516 --> 02:50:15.580]  And federal appeals are very expensive.
[02:50:15.580 --> 02:50:16.220]  Amazing.
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:19.663]  Now we've got a break, but I want to get General Stubblebine's response.
[02:50:19.663 --> 02:50:28.170]  And I know you're going over the government's own paperwork that comes with the vaccine, what they're admitting it does to people.
[02:50:29.915 --> 02:50:34.457]  But it looks to me like this program isn't going well for them.
[02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:40.559]  And we know that it's clearly martial law that's been declared through the civil emergency.
[02:50:40.559 --> 02:50:42.720]  The problem is, can they implement?
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:44.680]  It's one thing to declare something.
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:46.041]  It's another thing to implement it.
[02:50:46.989 --> 02:50:51.491]  We'll get General Stubblebine's breakdown on that with Dr. Rima Labo as well.
[02:50:51.491 --> 02:50:52.191]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:52.191 --> 02:50:54.412]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:50:54.412 --> 02:50:59.053]  We're also simulcasting the radio show in living color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:59.053 --> 02:51:00.274]  I want to thank all those members.
[02:51:01.664 --> 02:51:10.728]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[02:51:10.728 --> 02:51:20.252]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[02:51:20.632 --> 02:51:29.376]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium, along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.

[02:51:55.284 --> 02:51:57.504]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:57.504 --> 02:51:58.904]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:58.904 --> 02:52:00.045]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.003 --> 02:52:14.684]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.684 --> 02:52:21.066]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.066 --> 02:52:26.608]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.608 --> 02:52:36.231]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.351 --> 02:52:38.693]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.693 --> 02:52:40.294]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.294 --> 02:52:42.755]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.755 --> 02:52:44.877]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.877 --> 02:52:50.020]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:55.023]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:53:01.212 --> 02:53:04.955]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[02:53:04.955 --> 02:53:12.121]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:53:12.121 --> 02:53:17.146]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:53:17.426 --> 02:53:19.487]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:53:19.487 --> 02:53:25.972]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:53:25.972 --> 02:53:30.935]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products, requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:53:30.935 --> 02:53:40.261]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies, as well as the private sector, with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:53:40.261 --> 02:53:46.946]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:53:47.346 --> 02:53:52.150]  Preferably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.

[02:53:57.774 --> 02:54:11.364]  According to Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, Dr. Blaylock, and countless other medical doctors,
[02:54:12.984 --> 02:54:36.042]  We've had on and the medical research the army knows the government knows that more dangerous than the mercury which acts as an adjuvant is squalene it is the worst and it killed a lot of US troops it maimed hundreds of thousands and this is now even come out in Congress so when the CDC and the World Health Organization is in control of this orders
[02:54:36.994 --> 02:54:44.498]  That the European vaccines have high levels of squalene, and that squalene be mixed here, because they couldn't legally have it put in here, so they add it later.
[02:54:44.498 --> 02:54:48.941]  Because they know they're dealing with a stupid, not stupid, but uninformed nurse or doctor.
[02:54:50.424 --> 02:54:51.625]  This is so diabolical.
[02:54:51.625 --> 02:54:54.107]  I want to go back to General Stubblebine and then back to Dr. Labo.
[02:54:54.107 --> 02:54:56.949]  There's so much I want to cover here today.
[02:54:56.949 --> 02:55:05.276]  General, bottom line, we talk about eugenics, we talk about population reduction, we have the UN documents, we have their own statements.
[02:55:05.276 --> 02:55:12.782]  Is there any doubt in your mind that this is part of a depopulation program, that they're just setting the precedent now before its inoculation, testing
[02:55:13.462 --> 02:55:34.850]  How serious the soft kill weapons they put in the vaccines food and water can be and putting binary weapons into us as some documents show so later they can introduce a new pathogen and wipe control groups out because everything we see the architecture being built is a kill system and then of course six months ago we received a key piece of the puzzle
[02:55:35.845 --> 02:55:42.250]  Ecoscience, written by John P. Holdren, the White House science czar that says, we're going to put poison in your water to sterilize you.
[02:55:42.250 --> 02:55:44.692]  We're going to put stuff in your vaccines to sterilize you.
[02:55:44.692 --> 02:55:46.974]  And we have all these other UN documents saying the same thing.
[02:55:46.974 --> 02:55:53.339]  I mean, we have them doing it, but it's so diabolical, the average person just can't believe it's actually happening.
[02:55:53.339 --> 02:55:54.160]  General Stubblebine.
[02:55:55.503 --> 02:55:58.706]  Well, just think about it for a few minutes.
[02:55:58.706 --> 02:56:04.151]  I keep going back to the principles of war because it lays it all out very simply.
[02:56:04.151 --> 02:56:07.273]  One of the principles is called surprise.
[02:56:07.273 --> 02:56:09.335]  Another one is called simplicity.
[02:56:09.335 --> 02:56:10.996]  So think about this.
[02:56:10.996 --> 02:56:14.660]  I announced that there's going to be swine flu.
[02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:20.841]  So I surprise everybody with the fact that they've got swine flu coming.
[02:56:20.841 --> 02:56:28.283]  So everybody, very simply, walks in and says, vaccinate me now because I don't want swine flu.
[02:56:28.283 --> 02:56:31.563]  So now what do they put into the swine flu vaccine?
[02:56:31.563 --> 02:56:36.744]  Stuff that will make you very, very infertile, if not dead.
[02:56:36.744 --> 02:56:38.685]  Now, think about this.
[02:56:38.685 --> 02:56:40.185]  Who are they giving it to?
[02:56:40.185 --> 02:56:44.106]  Children, pregnant women, and the chronically ill.
[02:56:44.716 --> 02:56:47.738]  What happens to a child if he's now infertile?
[02:56:47.738 --> 02:56:49.499]  He never has a family.
[02:56:49.499 --> 02:56:51.761]  What happens to a pregnant woman now?
[02:56:51.761 --> 02:56:54.122]  She doesn't have any more children.
[02:56:54.122 --> 02:56:55.764]  So where do you go?
[02:56:55.764 --> 02:56:58.626]  Suddenly, the population stops.
[02:56:58.626 --> 02:56:59.906]  And what have you got?
[02:56:59.906 --> 02:57:02.128]  You have got genocide.
[02:57:02.128 --> 02:57:02.908]  Period.
[02:57:02.908 --> 02:57:05.430]  I want to go back to the squalene.
[02:57:05.430 --> 02:57:10.514]  A few molecules of squalene will make you very, very sick.
[02:57:10.514 --> 02:57:13.055]  The amount of squalene that they're putting into
[02:57:14.551 --> 02:57:23.756]  Human beings and two of the vaccines that the United States has illegally approved and that we hope to stop tomorrow in our law.
[02:57:24.743 --> 02:57:49.857]  In our hearing in Washington, two of those vaccines are already squalene-adjuvanted, one by Novartis and one by GlaxoSmithKline, but then they will add the squalene at the 90,000 injection location for the rest of the vaccine, and it's at the level one million times more than that which was put into the vaccine A.
[02:57:50.897 --> 02:57:51.518]  Thank you.
[02:58:05.751 --> 02:58:06.151]  Oh my god.
[02:58:06.151 --> 02:58:06.431]  Oh my god.
[02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:40.024]  I want the magnitude of this to sink in because on the inserts it admits these vaccines are associated with infertility and sterility and as you said they're aiming them right at the children and women.
[02:58:40.024 --> 02:58:43.284]  Unbelievable!
[02:58:43.284 --> 02:58:45.885]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.885 --> 02:58:49.046]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.276 --> 02:58:55.940]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.

[02:58:59.543 --> 02:59:04.347]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.

[02:59:10.733 --> 02:59:12.976]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.516 --> 02:59:13.816]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.816 --> 02:59:14.317]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.317 --> 02:59:15.117]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.117 --> 02:59:16.278]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.278 --> 02:59:18.519]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.409 --> 02:59:34.550]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:39.692]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:59:54.179 --> 02:59:56.560]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.560 --> 02:59:59.321]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.134 --> 03:00:15.300]  We're going to talk about a host of issues in this final hour with Major General Albert Stubblebine and his wife, Medical Doctor Rama Labo.
[03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:17.401]  Your phone calls are coming up at the 20 after.
[03:00:17.401 --> 03:00:18.903]  Go ahead and line up.
[03:00:18.903 --> 03:00:21.805]  I'm going to clear the call board.
[03:00:21.805 --> 03:00:25.148]  Calls only for General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo.
[03:00:25.148 --> 03:00:26.008]  Period.
[03:00:26.008 --> 03:00:31.493]  But it's a wide area to discuss, but we're going to spend our time, the valuable time we have with them, on this subject.
[03:00:31.493 --> 03:00:33.555]  We're going to talk about solutions in the next segment.
[03:00:34.235 --> 03:00:42.359]  We're going to talk about COINTELPRO attacking myself, Dr. Labo, General Stubblebine, and anybody else that's effective.
[03:00:42.359 --> 03:00:43.439]  So we're going to discuss that.
[03:00:43.439 --> 03:00:44.960]  That's the badge of honor.
[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:47.621]  When you're over the target, you're getting the flak.
[03:00:47.621 --> 03:00:51.203]  And the establishment admits the people are hurting them.
[03:00:51.203 --> 03:00:53.104]  I think they've overreached with this operation.
[03:00:53.104 --> 03:00:55.845]  But Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine,
[03:00:57.714 --> 03:01:02.515]  They are aiming these at women and children and people that are fertile.
[03:01:02.515 --> 03:01:10.717]  Just as the UN, as you know, you can give people the name of the hormone, we're caught adding a synthetic hormone to tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[03:01:10.717 --> 03:01:12.098]  And that's a stated UN goal.
[03:01:12.098 --> 03:01:16.499]  I mean, they admit they're doing it to us in their own government policy books.
[03:01:17.299 --> 03:01:18.640]  We better listen to them.
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.882]  So speak to that and the numbers on cancer, the numbers on diabetes, the numbers on autism.
[03:01:23.882 --> 03:01:34.608]  I mean they are killing us and they're incrementally turning up the ambient background on the soft kill and then institutionalizing all of our deaths and disease.
[03:01:35.328 --> 03:01:42.011]  And just standardizing it, where everybody gets cancer every year, everybody has diabetes, everybody's infertile.
[03:01:42.011 --> 03:01:45.012]  You know, 87% men's sperm count down.
[03:01:45.012 --> 03:01:47.233]  Infertility in women skyrocketing.
[03:01:47.233 --> 03:01:49.834]  Real fast, buzz through the numbers for folks.
[03:01:49.834 --> 03:01:51.975]  Dr. Lebo.
[03:01:51.975 --> 03:01:58.517]  The World Health Organization says in their public writings that they want to reduce the population by 99.0%.
[03:01:58.517 --> 03:02:01.759]  And they have been using
[03:02:05.609 --> 03:02:10.491]  Infertility vaccines since 1974.
[03:02:10.491 --> 03:02:20.495]  In 1985, they said in a public document that they were using these infertility vaccines disguised as smallpox vaccines.
[03:02:20.495 --> 03:02:23.076]  And by the way, the hormone is not a synthetic hormone.
[03:02:23.076 --> 03:02:29.379]  It's a natural hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin, HCG, which they introduced into the vaccine.
[03:02:30.179 --> 03:02:45.951]  Okay, doctor, my point was in the medical articles I read, and you can correct me, this was years ago, they pointed out that it had to be done by design because it had been simulated a natural hormone.
[03:02:45.951 --> 03:02:48.453]  I understand it's a natural hormone, but is that incorrect?
[03:02:48.453 --> 03:02:49.734]  That they artificially made it?
[03:02:50.885 --> 03:02:52.846]  Well, they artificially introduced it.
[03:02:52.846 --> 03:02:56.869]  At the time that they began this, they didn't have the technology to clone it.
[03:02:56.869 --> 03:02:58.009]  Maybe they do now.
[03:02:58.009 --> 03:03:10.657]  But the point is that it's molecularly identical to the natural hormone, and then women make antibodies to it, so their body attacks their own pregnancies forever.
[03:03:10.657 --> 03:03:13.159]  That's one way of creating an immune system.
[03:03:13.519 --> 03:03:14.459]  Thank you so much!
[03:03:39.407 --> 03:03:39.768]  Thank you.
[03:03:46.904 --> 03:03:52.347]  We're talking about ending the next generation.
[03:03:52.347 --> 03:04:06.536]  I also want to remind listeners that we now know, as of today, that two scientists, one of them named Robert Webster and the other, Richard Webby, are listed as patent holders for U.S.
[03:04:06.536 --> 03:04:07.637]  patent application
[03:04:11.085 --> 03:04:20.670]  9-0-0-1-0-9-6-2 for Genetically Engineered Twine Flu Influenza Virus and Uses Thereof.
[03:04:20.670 --> 03:04:30.196]  Robert Webster and Richard Webby are employed by the World Health Organization at their influenza laboratory.
[03:04:30.196 --> 03:04:33.958]  Now, if that doesn't say the whole thing, then I don't know what does.
[03:04:34.378 --> 03:04:55.883]  So we have squalene for infertility, we have squalene for profound autoimmune disorders, we have the swine flu that will kill large numbers of people through the vaccination, and we have the pandemic international health regulations which allow the
[03:04:57.389 --> 03:04:58.109]  All right, stay there.
[03:04:58.109 --> 03:04:59.290]  We gotta come back.
[03:04:59.290 --> 03:05:01.130]  We'll continue along that line with our guest.
[03:05:01.130 --> 03:05:10.153]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:05:10.153 --> 03:05:13.534]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:05:13.534 --> 03:05:19.396]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[03:05:19.396 --> 03:05:24.177]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:05:24.177 --> 03:05:26.518]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:05:26.698 --> 03:05:27.118]  Thank you.
[03:05:45.629 --> 03:05:49.333]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[03:05:49.333 --> 03:05:51.536]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.
[03:05:51.536 --> 03:05:56.522]  Or call about OxySilver, Zeolife, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:05:56.522 --> 03:05:58.064]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:05:58.064 --> 03:05:58.524]  Do it now!
[03:06:01.618 --> 03:06:04.619]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.619 --> 03:06:09.961]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.961 --> 03:06:12.002]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:12.002 --> 03:06:17.003]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:17.003 --> 03:06:18.184]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.184 --> 03:06:19.304]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.304 --> 03:06:21.185]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.185 --> 03:06:22.265]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.265 --> 03:06:24.466]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.466 --> 03:06:25.807]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.807 --> 03:06:27.107]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.327 --> 03:06:32.593]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.593 --> 03:06:36.178]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.178 --> 03:06:40.002]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:40.002 --> 03:06:41.243]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.243 --> 03:06:42.145]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.145 --> 03:06:43.246]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.246 --> 03:06:43.987]  All you can get.
[03:06:43.987 --> 03:06:44.988]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.248 --> 03:06:48.313]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.313 --> 03:06:50.076]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:50.076 --> 03:06:50.997]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.572 --> 03:07:04.675]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:07:04.675 --> 03:07:07.577]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:07:07.577 --> 03:07:09.659]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:07:09.659 --> 03:07:11.901]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:07:11.901 --> 03:07:13.542]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:07:13.542 --> 03:07:18.025]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:07:18.025 --> 03:07:20.287]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:07:20.567 --> 03:07:26.589]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[03:07:26.589 --> 03:07:31.391]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:07:31.391 --> 03:07:34.212]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:07:34.212 --> 03:07:36.933]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:07:36.933 --> 03:07:44.095]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:07:44.395 --> 03:07:50.357]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:07:50.357 --> 03:07:53.198]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:07:53.198 --> 03:08:03.042]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:08:03.042 --> 03:08:09.665]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.665 --> 03:08:12.646]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.331 --> 03:08:17.634]  Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Rima Labo are our guests.
[03:08:17.634 --> 03:08:22.076]  Your call's coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:08:22.076 --> 03:08:26.959]  Doctor, I want you to be able to finish what you were just getting into with the squalene alone.
[03:08:26.959 --> 03:08:32.743]  And of course, a lot of other top scientists are saying this virus was clearly manufactured.
[03:08:32.743 --> 03:08:36.125]  But, addressing General Stubblebine for a moment.
[03:08:36.125 --> 03:08:40.047]  Sir, obviously it takes high moral character and strength
[03:08:41.377 --> 03:08:59.662]  To be able to read these government documents where they admit they're putting poison in our water and the vaccines, when they admit they've designed GMO foods to hurt fertility or sterilize us, to admit that we have this group of eugenicists running things, then a lot of foolish yuppies and people that think they're members of the establishment will say, so what?
[03:08:59.662 --> 03:09:01.162]  There are too many people.
[03:09:01.162 --> 03:09:05.564]  Not realizing it's aimed at them as well.
[03:09:05.564 --> 03:09:06.284]  I would like you
[03:09:07.577 --> 03:09:13.539]  To speak to the nature of the type of mindset that we're facing with our enemy, the character of our enemy.
[03:09:13.539 --> 03:09:23.723]  And I'd like you to speak to our military and police, who are really starting to wake up right now, about their duty and if you'd like to challenge them to look at the evidence, to do the research.
[03:09:23.723 --> 03:09:27.865]  Because I understand this is hard to admit to, even when you have the documents.
[03:09:27.865 --> 03:09:29.406]  It's hard to come to grips
[03:09:30.106 --> 03:09:34.370]  I mean, imagine being General Stubblebine or Dr. Labo or myself.
[03:09:34.370 --> 03:09:36.692]  I mean, we're in the spotlight against these people.
[03:09:36.692 --> 03:09:37.813]  We get attacked by them.
[03:09:37.813 --> 03:09:40.555]  I mean, I've been attacked at major symposiums by the government.
[03:09:40.555 --> 03:09:43.278]  They're writing hit pieces on me every day.
[03:09:43.278 --> 03:09:46.721]  They have COINTELPRO posing as patriots attacking us at every level.
[03:09:47.341 --> 03:09:47.541]  No way.
[03:09:47.541 --> 03:09:48.902]  Absolutely cannot be on the fence.
[03:10:12.065 --> 03:10:18.291]  First of all, what are the kind of people that would do something like this?
[03:10:18.291 --> 03:10:23.717]  The people who are involved in spreading all of this?
[03:10:23.717 --> 03:10:26.660]  Well, first of all, they've got to be psychopaths.
[03:10:26.660 --> 03:10:30.124]  I mean, nobody who has any principles at all
[03:10:34.858 --> 03:10:36.418]  Let me cut in for a minute.
[03:10:36.418 --> 03:10:42.961]  My training is in psychiatry, and I practiced drug-free psychiatry and medicine for many, many years, Alex.
[03:10:42.961 --> 03:10:47.963]  A psychopath is a person who has no affiliation with any other human being.
[03:10:48.463 --> 03:10:50.104]  No one else matters.
[03:10:50.104 --> 03:10:57.508]  They appear to look like connected people, but they are in fact totally devoid of any human sensibility.
[03:10:57.508 --> 03:11:05.273]  In my view, they have given up their humanity and their psychopathic... And doctor, I've interviewed other experts on psychopaths.
[03:11:05.273 --> 03:11:14.798]  They also say that they not only don't care, you have a sadistic psychopath that enjoys hurting particularly innocents, women and children.
[03:11:14.798 --> 03:11:16.239]  They enjoy torturing.
[03:11:16.787 --> 03:11:17.869]  Absolutely.
[03:11:17.869 --> 03:11:19.852]  And who are they attacking first?
[03:11:19.852 --> 03:11:20.713]  Women?
[03:11:20.713 --> 03:11:21.835]  Pregnant women?
[03:11:21.835 --> 03:11:22.536]  And children?
[03:11:23.607 --> 03:11:27.390]  The most vulnerable, the most valuable, are being attacked first.
[03:11:27.390 --> 03:11:37.596]  Not in Switzerland, where this same vaccine is being forbidden to pregnant women and children and the chronically ill because it's too dangerous.
[03:11:37.596 --> 03:11:45.522]  But in the United States, the home of the formerly free and the psychopathic leaders, yes.
[03:11:45.522 --> 03:11:48.904]  And in Germany, by the way, in Germany, the
[03:11:51.053 --> 03:12:01.304]  Members of the powerful political elite and the military have squalene-free vaccines and everybody else gets squalene vaccines.
[03:12:01.304 --> 03:12:07.211]  By the way, Doctor, I remember seeing you over a month ago and others in releases saying
[03:12:08.396 --> 03:12:15.959]  That the elites all over the world were getting a clean vaccine without squalene, enderleukins, mercury, aluminum.
[03:12:15.959 --> 03:12:19.000]  And then now it's even in Time Magazine that that's the truth.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.261]  So I want to just confirm that you were right there.
[03:12:21.261 --> 03:12:23.262]  But going back to General Stubblebine to finish my question.
[03:12:24.022 --> 03:12:25.483]  So we know who we're dealing with.
[03:12:25.483 --> 03:12:28.504]  These are control freaks who enjoy torturing innocents.
[03:12:28.504 --> 03:12:29.844]  They hate innocents.
[03:12:29.844 --> 03:12:30.764]  They hate goodness.
[03:12:30.764 --> 03:12:33.425]  They revel in death and destruction.
[03:12:33.425 --> 03:12:44.069]  But then speaking to people on the fence who've been mentally weak and have not looked at the research and the facts, what do you say to people who aren't evil but are following orders, General?
[03:12:44.069 --> 03:12:52.712]  Well, first of all, there are a lot of people who absolutely don't know what is the real
[03:12:53.291 --> 03:12:54.132]  I think so.
[03:13:14.310 --> 03:13:21.014]  Out of the grip of the psychopaths and get them working for you.
[03:13:21.014 --> 03:13:27.077]  Well one of the ways we do this is to make sure that they're getting the truth.
[03:13:27.077 --> 03:13:30.039]  We're doing that by getting the message out.
[03:13:31.289 --> 03:13:39.491]  And we're getting voices going that are saying, stop, don't do this anymore.
[03:13:39.491 --> 03:13:54.456]  And I believe that a good part of the break that's been put on a lot of the genocide right at the moment has been a direct result of the voices of the people saying, no, no, no, no.
[03:13:56.822 --> 03:13:58.003]  Who are these people?
[03:13:58.003 --> 03:14:01.405]  They're people who we have finally begun to wake up.
[03:14:01.405 --> 03:14:05.108]  As you well know, Alex, these folks operate in secrecy.
[03:14:05.108 --> 03:14:06.649]  They're like poison mushrooms.
[03:14:06.649 --> 03:14:09.231]  They grow in the dank, dark shade.
[03:14:09.231 --> 03:14:16.215]  And when you shine the light of both information and reason on them, they wither.
[03:14:16.215 --> 03:14:17.156]  Now, do they die?
[03:14:17.156 --> 03:14:17.516]  No.
[03:14:17.516 --> 03:14:21.279]  They go away, and they come back again through another door.
[03:14:21.279 --> 03:14:24.601]  But over and over and over, what you're doing and what we're doing
[03:14:25.421 --> 03:14:34.164]  People like William Lewis getting the information out there and suing them, suing the bastards, has the effect of pushing them back.
[03:14:34.164 --> 03:14:35.745]  That's right, that's right.
[03:14:35.745 --> 03:14:39.646]  They are bold and run their soft kill operations on us.
[03:14:39.646 --> 03:14:51.970]  We have to be bold and have courage and stand up to them and I want to get into solutions and then phone calls and some other key areas we haven't gotten into yet, but I wanted to go back to General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo and make this point.
[03:14:55.132 --> 03:15:01.276]  One more point that I need to make, and that is, again, back to the principles of war.
[03:15:01.276 --> 03:15:04.419]  One of the most important ones is MAS.
[03:15:04.419 --> 03:15:05.019]  MAS.
[03:15:05.019 --> 03:15:12.024]  That means the more voices that you've got, the better your chances are that you're going to turn this thing around.
[03:15:12.024 --> 03:15:19.068]  That means everybody, everybody needs to go to the website and take the actions that are stated there.
[03:15:20.713 --> 03:15:22.094]  That's got to be heard!
[03:15:22.094 --> 03:15:26.455]  I want to talk, and the website is healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:15:26.455 --> 03:15:29.416]  I want to talk about the Health Keepers' Oath.
[03:15:29.416 --> 03:15:41.680]  Many people know about the Oath Keepers, the military and the police and peacekeepers who are, whether retired or active duty, saying, I will not accept an illegal order.
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:49.223]  Well, as of October 23rd, when the health emergency was declared, the second stage health emergency by Obama,
[03:15:51.597 --> 03:16:08.506]  That means that the entire medical system has been pulled into the vortex and now it is the hospitals that are going to be used as the staging and the control system, just as the medical system was pulled into the evil in Germany.
[03:16:08.506 --> 03:16:13.128]  And so I, as a healthcare professional, have created the Healthkeeper's Oath.
[03:16:13.508 --> 03:16:22.577]  And I am asking you, if you are a health keeper, to go to healthfreedomusa.org and take the health keeper's oath.
[03:16:22.577 --> 03:16:24.999]  And then share it with your colleagues.
[03:16:24.999 --> 03:16:27.841]  If you're not a health keeper, you know health keepers.
[03:16:27.841 --> 03:16:34.287]  You know doctors and nurses and administrators and janitors and clerks and nurses' aides.
[03:16:34.287 --> 03:16:34.968]  That's right.
[03:16:34.968 --> 03:16:37.470]  We're having major victories right now.
[03:16:38.547 --> 03:16:55.940]  The CFR and others have put out press releases admitting that they're losing their fight to set up a medical dictatorship and they're very, very angry about it and they've been caught talking about, oh, let's say there's a shortage, they said this a month ago, of the flu shot to create a panic to get it because nobody wants it.
[03:16:55.940 --> 03:16:59.143]  They laugh and giggle, they enjoy their psychopathic evil.
[03:16:59.143 --> 03:17:03.406]  But before we go to break and come back and take calls and get into more solutions, I wanted to bring this up.
[03:17:04.619 --> 03:17:11.983]  And I need to do a whole show on this, and present evidence of it, and then educate the public.
[03:17:11.983 --> 03:17:19.347]  But just take the comments on Infowars.com, and take the comments on YouTube, and take the other sites.
[03:17:19.347 --> 03:17:25.891]  The establishment knows they can't attack us from an establishment position, because the establishment's discredited.
[03:17:26.707 --> 03:17:35.940]  So what they do is they try to get the alternative media to infight with each other by having operatives in there to then stir up other weak-minded people.
[03:17:35.940 --> 03:17:41.407]  But what we found is we have people lurking on InfoWars that the minute
[03:17:42.208 --> 03:17:45.932]  A story goes live and the stories are going live every 20-30 minutes.
[03:17:45.932 --> 03:17:54.280]  They want to comment first to get the whole comment changing saying I'm a Fed, this person's a Fed, anybody who's good they say this about.
[03:17:54.280 --> 03:18:01.628]  They'll tell lies that aren't backed up and then they will, because we can see their IP addresses,
[03:18:03.479 --> 03:18:12.135]  They will act like they're the other people agreeing with them to create a fake consensus and then they will say this site doesn't call for violence.
[03:18:13.752 --> 03:18:18.155]  This site is bad and wants you to just waste your time.
[03:18:18.155 --> 03:18:19.495]  Nobody's winning.
[03:18:19.495 --> 03:18:21.176]  Nobody has any power.
[03:18:21.176 --> 03:18:22.337]  We've lost.
[03:18:22.337 --> 03:18:24.558]  We're going to lose.
[03:18:24.558 --> 03:18:29.001]  And we can then track the IP address and it's being blocked and it goes to government servers.
[03:18:29.001 --> 03:18:35.824]  The point, and the government admits they're doing this, the point is they're like Tokyo Rose telling us, you've lost.
[03:18:35.824 --> 03:18:36.705]  You have no power.
[03:18:36.705 --> 03:18:37.525]  You can't win.
[03:18:37.525 --> 03:18:38.926]  Speaking up does nothing.
[03:18:38.926 --> 03:18:40.287]  You need to go out and shoot people.
[03:18:41.107 --> 03:18:45.870]  And then they flip and the same IP address says we're calling for violence.
[03:18:45.870 --> 03:18:48.131]  So the point is we're not calling for violence.
[03:18:48.131 --> 03:18:56.015]  We're actually having victories and building the history that we have power, showing the people they have power.
[03:18:56.015 --> 03:18:59.237]  So I wanted to bring this up to General Stubblebine as we go to break.
[03:18:59.237 --> 03:19:03.999]  What is that tactic of black ops and propaganda where they keep telling us we're going to lose?
[03:19:03.999 --> 03:19:05.940]  They keep telling us we have no hope.
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:07.781]  They keep trying to get us to end fight.
[03:19:09.827 --> 03:19:13.488]  I mean, this is, they're clearly doing this.
[03:19:13.488 --> 03:19:15.109]  Absolutely they're doing it.
[03:19:15.109 --> 03:19:18.470]  And it's exactly what you call it.
[03:19:18.470 --> 03:19:20.311]  Black ops.
[03:19:20.311 --> 03:19:21.671]  Black operations.
[03:19:21.671 --> 03:19:29.694]  And they're doing it so that we begin to turn on each other and get at each other's throats.
[03:19:29.694 --> 03:19:33.535]  You know, the health freedom movement is
[03:19:34.192 --> 03:19:34.752]  Stay there.
[03:19:34.752 --> 03:19:35.173]  Stay there.
[03:19:35.173 --> 03:19:35.653]  Gotta break.
[03:19:35.653 --> 03:19:35.733]  Key.
[03:20:01.988 --> 03:20:03.548]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:20:03.548 --> 03:20:05.049]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:20:05.049 --> 03:20:06.389]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:08.330]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:20:08.330 --> 03:20:17.113]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:20:17.113 --> 03:20:22.534]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:20:22.534 --> 03:20:24.135]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:20:24.335 --> 03:20:31.820]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:20:31.820 --> 03:20:36.003]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:20:36.003 --> 03:20:38.725]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[03:20:38.725 --> 03:20:43.709]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[03:21:02.757 --> 03:21:06.420]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.420 --> 03:21:10.023]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.023 --> 03:21:14.827]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:21:14.827 --> 03:21:21.212]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.212 --> 03:21:23.454]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:21:24.034 --> 03:21:26.395]  As American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.395 --> 03:21:29.657]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:21:29.657 --> 03:21:36.500]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.500 --> 03:21:38.861]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.861 --> 03:21:40.442]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.442 --> 03:21:42.903]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.903 --> 03:21:45.024]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.024 --> 03:21:46.545]  And right now in Washington DC,
[03:21:47.265 --> 03:21:50.167]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:22:01.175 --> 03:22:03.458]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:03.458 --> 03:22:05.059]  November 4th, 2009.
[03:22:05.059 --> 03:22:07.202]  Gold opened this morning at $10.9320.
[03:22:07.202 --> 03:22:10.605]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $11.2322, $5.6161 for a half ounce, or $2.8081 for the quarter ounce.
[03:22:10.605 --> 03:22:10.946]  That's $11.2322, $5.6161, or $2.8081.
[03:22:20.569 --> 03:22:31.034]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[03:22:31.034 --> 03:22:34.256]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[03:22:34.256 --> 03:22:37.638]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[03:22:37.638 --> 03:22:40.619]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[03:22:40.619 --> 03:22:43.401]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[03:22:43.401 --> 03:22:43.881]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:43.881 --> 03:22:44.662]  Unlike your liberty,
[03:22:47.503 --> 03:22:48.644]  The paper is free.
[03:22:48.644 --> 03:22:49.505]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:49.505 --> 03:22:55.252]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.252 --> 03:22:55.432]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.428 --> 03:23:05.970]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:23:05.970 --> 03:23:06.890]  Number one.
[03:23:06.890 --> 03:23:10.312]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:23:10.312 --> 03:23:11.172]  Number two.
[03:23:11.172 --> 03:23:16.054]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:23:16.054 --> 03:23:16.814]  It's true.
[03:23:16.814 --> 03:23:21.356]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:23:21.676 --> 03:23:22.497]  Number 3.
[03:23:22.497 --> 03:23:26.081]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:23:26.081 --> 03:23:30.006]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:23:30.006 --> 03:23:30.807]  Number 4.
[03:23:30.807 --> 03:23:33.570]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:23:33.570 --> 03:23:37.254]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:23:37.254 --> 03:23:37.475]  Number 5.
[03:23:38.015 --> 03:23:42.179]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:23:42.179 --> 03:23:47.224]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:23:47.224 --> 03:23:51.408]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:23:51.408 --> 03:23:53.190]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:57.795]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:24:20.556 --> 03:24:22.860]  You know, I tend to ignore it when I get death threats.
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:26.948]  I tend to ignore it when national media attacks me and admits I'm on the White House enemies list number 24.
[03:24:29.599 --> 03:24:37.928]  But we need to address that and point out in this supposed free country we're under attack for reading the vaccine drug inserts on air.
[03:24:37.928 --> 03:24:44.835]  We're under attack pointing out local news where the Marine Corps and Army are running checkpoints tasering citizens.
[03:24:44.835 --> 03:24:45.957]  That's in the news today.
[03:24:47.967 --> 03:25:05.281]  And then, when you actually see it's the same IP addresses, trying to get people to be violent, or then saying there's no point, none of us can win, we have no power, trying to sap our will, when we're having victories, over 70% of the public's refusing it.
[03:25:05.281 --> 03:25:07.423]  Most of the doctors in England won't take it or give it.
[03:25:07.423 --> 03:25:09.425]  Most of the doctors in Germany won't take it.
[03:25:09.425 --> 03:25:12.988]  Major publications are admitting it has cancer viruses and RNA in it.
[03:25:14.415 --> 03:25:16.961]  And I almost think these are death throes.
[03:25:16.961 --> 03:25:19.626]  I mean, the establishment has the money, has the power.
[03:25:19.626 --> 03:25:21.991]  They may win, but they're certainly not
[03:25:23.379 --> 03:25:27.620]  Dominating and we're seeing them by attrition lose power.
[03:25:27.620 --> 03:25:29.841]  We're seeing them stall out.
[03:25:29.841 --> 03:25:41.644]  We're seeing them grind in the mud and we're having victories but meanwhile you see the government admitting they've got tens of thousands of paid bloggers and operatives out there putting out this info.
[03:25:41.644 --> 03:25:49.466]  Going back to General Stubblebine, are you seeing the same thing that we're making major inroads and they're really screaming bloody murder and freaking out right now?
[03:25:50.106 --> 03:25:54.130]  First of all, we are attacked all of the time, just like you.
[03:25:54.130 --> 03:25:56.913]  We're attacked by crazies.
[03:25:56.913 --> 03:26:02.439]  And what we have done so far is absolutely ignore them.
[03:26:02.439 --> 03:26:07.504]  We don't spend the time giving them any traction whatsoever.
[03:26:07.504 --> 03:26:10.687]  They talk, they fuss, they... One of my favorite crazies
[03:26:13.178 --> 03:26:14.859]  I'm good to go.
[03:26:32.089 --> 03:26:39.515]  Well, when Bird brings me a cup of coffee in the morning, I acquire a mind with the caffeine in the coffee.
[03:26:39.515 --> 03:26:42.257]  But that's how crazy it gets.
[03:26:42.257 --> 03:26:44.839]  And yet people believe in this stuff.
[03:26:44.839 --> 03:26:47.461]  It's like going to a bullfight.
[03:26:47.461 --> 03:26:50.263]  People don't go to see the matador's costume.
[03:26:50.263 --> 03:26:51.744]  They go for the blood.
[03:26:51.744 --> 03:26:59.350]  And so playing to the lowest, basest instincts, the crazies who are stimulated by and the
[03:27:00.371 --> 03:27:10.577]  The government employees who are directed by the forces that don't want our pushback attack you, they attack us, they attack other groups.
[03:27:10.577 --> 03:27:11.698]  But that's what I'm saying.
[03:27:11.698 --> 03:27:22.224]  I mean, I never address this, but I think I am going to do some programs where I actually show the proof and then show the government documents because that shows we're the good guys that
[03:27:23.106 --> 03:27:39.095]  That this is happening, that they're coming after us, and that we are effective, and just illustrating that they do wait on the articles to get everyone not discussing, protesting, or suing like the New York nurses did to stop forced inoculation there.
[03:27:39.095 --> 03:27:50.442]  I notice anything effective that will stop them, they're there on the comments to try to turn everything around where the debate isn't about that, and then we check their IPs and they're the government.
[03:27:50.442 --> 03:27:52.263]  I mean, that is pure evil.
[03:27:52.623 --> 03:27:54.284]  I can't imagine being in this government.
[03:27:54.284 --> 03:27:59.348]  That's exactly what Black Ops is about.
[03:27:59.348 --> 03:28:00.649]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:28:00.649 --> 03:28:03.571]  You know what we did on our blogs, Alex?
[03:28:03.571 --> 03:28:11.036]  We simply clicked the button that said no comments because we don't have time to deal with this nonsense.
[03:28:11.036 --> 03:28:15.039]  There's plenty of opportunity for people to read the negative stuff.
[03:28:15.039 --> 03:28:16.981]  We put out the real stuff.
[03:28:16.981 --> 03:28:18.922]  We put out the pushback that works.
[03:28:19.941 --> 03:28:26.645]  No, I know, but I mean, I allow the free-for-all because I think it's teaching people, and folks are actually learning.
[03:28:26.645 --> 03:28:36.171]  And I think it's great, but we don't have time to deal with it, and it has to be dealt with, and we don't have the manpower to deal with it.
[03:28:36.171 --> 03:28:36.991]  No, no, no.
[03:28:36.991 --> 03:28:40.934]  I mean, listen, the only reason I brought it up is the government is out there doing this.
[03:28:40.934 --> 03:28:41.534]  It's real.
[03:28:41.534 --> 03:28:42.875]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:28:42.875 --> 03:28:45.436]  Certainly.
[03:28:45.436 --> 03:28:48.378]  Who's behind all of the genocide anyway?
[03:28:49.525 --> 03:28:50.906]  You know, it's not your friends.
[03:28:50.906 --> 03:28:53.387]  So yes, I agree with you.
[03:28:53.387 --> 03:28:55.647]  Of course the government is out there doing it.
[03:28:55.647 --> 03:28:58.469]  And we've been viciously attacked just as you have.
[03:28:58.469 --> 03:29:04.071]  And some people wander off, but they come back because eventually truth does ring like a bell.
[03:29:04.071 --> 03:29:05.171]  But that's what I was going to say.
[03:29:05.171 --> 03:29:06.832]  I mean, the reason I brought this up with you
[03:29:07.532 --> 03:29:07.672]  Yes.
[03:29:27.822 --> 03:29:34.764]  Go out and warn young girls that are being sterilized by the Gardasil, that are being sterilized by the vaccines.
[03:29:34.764 --> 03:29:37.345]  Go out and give people the vaccine inserts.
[03:29:37.345 --> 03:29:38.586]  Warn people.
[03:29:38.586 --> 03:29:40.906]  Don't get caught up in the infighting.
[03:29:40.906 --> 03:29:44.688]  Know what it is and just do the good work of warning people.
[03:29:44.688 --> 03:29:49.249]  Let's come back and take phone calls, get more into the vaccines and solutions.
[03:29:49.249 --> 03:29:51.830]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:53.230]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.230 --> 03:29:54.731]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.752 --> 03:30:01.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.217 --> 03:30:06.523]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.523 --> 03:30:11.067]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.067 --> 03:30:13.329]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.329 --> 03:30:14.951]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.951 --> 03:30:16.012]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.212 --> 03:30:24.638]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:30:24.638 --> 03:30:32.103]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:30:32.103 --> 03:30:38.147]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:30:38.147 --> 03:30:43.731]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:30:44.151 --> 03:30:48.295]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:30:48.295 --> 03:30:54.521]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[03:30:54.521 --> 03:30:55.763]  866-762-9238.

[03:31:01.124 --> 03:31:10.270]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:10.270 --> 03:31:13.632]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.632 --> 03:31:19.515]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.

[03:31:24.298 --> 03:31:26.640]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.

[03:32:04.505 --> 03:32:06.347]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[03:32:06.347 --> 03:32:11.252]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[03:32:11.252 --> 03:32:16.277]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[03:33:33.549 --> 03:33:43.255]  Well, we have Major General Albert Stubblebine on with us and Dr. Remo Labo joining us from Germany where they're fighting the internationalists taking over vitamins and nutrients.
[03:33:44.977 --> 03:33:48.241]  They say you can't have that vitamin D, but you can have fluoride.
[03:33:48.241 --> 03:33:50.304]  That's good for you.
[03:33:50.304 --> 03:33:55.611]  And we're going to go to Tiffany, Todd, Kathy, Ann, and Paul and others here in just a moment.
[03:33:55.611 --> 03:34:02.180]  And I want to have Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine back up next week or the week after because so much is happening right now.
[03:34:03.410 --> 03:34:06.811]  And I want to have them up every few weeks just so we can open phones up and take your calls.
[03:34:06.811 --> 03:34:11.593]  I don't want to hog all their time just for myself, but obviously we've covered quite a bit already.
[03:34:11.593 --> 03:34:13.813]  We're going back to them here in just a moment.
[03:34:13.813 --> 03:34:17.895]  I wanted to thank a few sponsors that made the show possible today before we do that.
[03:34:17.895 --> 03:34:20.935]  One of them is a Cola Blue, the fabulous atmospheric water generator.
[03:34:20.935 --> 03:34:23.876]  It grabs water right out of the air.
[03:34:23.876 --> 03:34:26.057]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle.
[03:34:26.057 --> 03:34:31.639]  Has a little computerized great system, hot water, cold water, sends it through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon.

[03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:44.650]  And I also want to tell you about frontsight.com.
[03:34:44.650 --> 03:34:46.151]  It's one thing to buy a bunch of firearms and ammo.
[03:34:58.499 --> 03:35:03.405]  It's another thing to go out to the shooting range and get some training, especially if you've had no training.
[03:35:03.405 --> 03:35:06.829]  And frontside is a non-drill instructor, non-tough guy attitude.
[03:35:06.829 --> 03:35:07.470]  It's family.
[03:35:08.880 --> 03:35:12.244]  It is the premier organization above law enforcement and military training.
[03:35:12.244 --> 03:35:15.667]  A lot of police and military go there to tune up on what they're doing.
[03:35:15.667 --> 03:35:16.788]  It's FrontSight.com.
[03:35:16.788 --> 03:35:22.034]  They have a deal for a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:35:22.034 --> 03:35:26.659]  When you sign up for five days of world-class gun training, it's very inexpensive, very affordable.
[03:35:26.659 --> 03:35:31.003]  And along with it, you get a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:35:31.624 --> 03:35:32.565]  Very inexpensive.
[03:35:32.565 --> 03:35:34.266]  Check it out at FrontSite.com.
[03:35:34.266 --> 03:35:37.809]  That's FrontSite.com, like the front of your rifle.
[03:35:37.809 --> 03:35:39.691]  FrontSite.com.
[03:35:39.691 --> 03:35:41.733]  Find out more there today.
[03:35:41.733 --> 03:35:54.744]  And I did want to just plug that the biggest fight we have right now is the global banking system taking over, the global carbon tax takeover, the fake environmental movement that has nothing to do with the environment.
[03:35:54.744 --> 03:35:57.146]  And we are doing a special right now
[03:35:59.244 --> 03:36:12.095]  That's for a limited time, where you get Fall of the Republic for $19.95, you get the Obama Deception for $9.95, and you get Reflections and Warnings with the late, great Aaron Russo that I made, his final video interview.
[03:36:12.095 --> 03:36:15.098]  It's a film in and of itself, over 90 minutes long.
[03:36:16.431 --> 03:36:17.472]  Free.
[03:36:17.472 --> 03:36:23.460]  You get that film free with Fall the Republic in that combo pack.
[03:36:23.460 --> 03:36:31.110]  You can also get Fall the Republic with in-game half price and then Reflections and Warnings for free.
[03:36:31.110 --> 03:36:33.213]  And people that have seen Reflections and Warnings are really
[03:36:35.031 --> 03:36:36.591]  Really impressed by it.
[03:36:36.591 --> 03:36:41.752]  The Nick Rockefeller revelations about how they plan to bring in eugenics and world population reduction.
[03:36:41.752 --> 03:36:43.713]  It's an important documentary to see.
[03:36:43.713 --> 03:36:49.074]  Get reflections and warnings free at InfoWars.com or ask about the special combo deals when you call 888-253-3139.
[03:36:49.074 --> 03:36:49.214]  888-253-3139.
[03:36:49.214 --> 03:36:52.575]  Now I'm really bad about not going to calls and I want to hear the questions.
[03:36:58.556 --> 03:37:00.499]  For General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo.
[03:37:00.499 --> 03:37:02.641]  But so much is happening.
[03:37:02.641 --> 03:37:04.083]  Where are you guys next week?
[03:37:04.083 --> 03:37:09.510]  We should go ahead and set you guys up to come back on for an hour, hour and a half next week.
[03:37:09.510 --> 03:37:13.074]  Because so much is moving and two hours isn't going to be enough today.
[03:37:13.074 --> 03:37:14.857]  Is next week good or is the week after better?
[03:37:15.367 --> 03:37:16.628]  I think next week is fine.
[03:37:16.628 --> 03:37:17.988]  We'll be back in Panama.
[03:37:17.988 --> 03:37:21.209]  We're in Germany now at the Codex meeting.
[03:37:21.209 --> 03:37:28.272]  We'll be back in Panama at the Valley of the Moon eco-demonstration project, which, by the way, is making huge inroads.
[03:37:28.272 --> 03:37:34.775]  That's part of the solution to reclaim the production of food for farmers and non-farmers alike.
[03:37:34.775 --> 03:37:38.597]  So, we'll be there, and we would love to talk to you, Alex.
[03:37:38.597 --> 03:37:38.917]  All right.
[03:37:38.917 --> 03:37:41.258]  In closing on the COINTELPRO, then we're going to calls.
[03:37:42.622 --> 03:37:55.129]  To simplify it, we have the Army Field Manual, declassified in 2004, written for Latin America, where they say, go out and say the local leaders who are good are really feds.
[03:37:55.129 --> 03:37:59.972]  Where they teach the Army, in black ops, how to get everybody fighting with each other.
[03:37:59.972 --> 03:38:02.973]  And General Stubblebine can certainly expose that.
[03:38:02.973 --> 03:38:10.698]  We see that anybody who's saying, we can stand together, we can lead, we can fight the globalists, is demonized, because the system knows they're
[03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:15.939]  Discredited, they have to pose as patriots to then infight.
[03:38:15.939 --> 03:38:19.526]  Infighting is the sign of being an operative or one of their mentally ill stooges.
[03:38:19.526 --> 03:38:20.708]  And in closing, I'll say this.
[03:38:22.463 --> 03:38:26.864]  It isn't Ron Paul that's trying to pass the Private Federal Reserve World Government Takeover.
[03:38:26.864 --> 03:38:30.545]  It isn't Alex Jones that's trying to make you take forced inoculations.
[03:38:30.545 --> 03:38:34.486]  It isn't General Stubblebine that's trying to put sodium fluoride in your water.
[03:38:34.486 --> 03:38:39.868]  It isn't Dr. Reema Labo that is federalizing your local police.
[03:38:39.868 --> 03:38:43.089]  It's the big corrupt offshore banks.
[03:38:43.089 --> 03:38:50.791]  And so, why do all these supposed patriot groups and sites spend all their time attacking whoever is effective?
[03:38:51.511 --> 03:38:57.735]  They do that so you'll get sucked off into these end fights and never become the leaders you were meant to be.
[03:38:57.735 --> 03:39:00.497]  So I'll say this today.
[03:39:00.497 --> 03:39:02.358]  Let's just say Alex Jones is bad.
[03:39:02.358 --> 03:39:03.179]  I'm pure evil.
[03:39:03.179 --> 03:39:03.619]  I'm not.
[03:39:03.619 --> 03:39:05.160]  My fruits are excellent.
[03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:05.921]  I'm pure of heart.
[03:39:05.921 --> 03:39:08.542]  Anyone with discernment knows that.
[03:39:08.542 --> 03:39:11.524]  14 years of fighting, 15, 16, 17 hours a day.
[03:39:11.524 --> 03:39:13.146]  But let's just say I'm evil.
[03:39:13.146 --> 03:39:21.011]  Let's just say General Stubblebine's bad, and he's not a great patriot who's come over to our side, and he was always on our side, but woke up and fully went against the evil.
[03:39:22.162 --> 03:39:23.103]  Let's just say he's bad.
[03:39:23.103 --> 03:39:24.945]  Let's just say Ron Paul's bad.
[03:39:24.945 --> 03:39:27.168]  Okay, let's get past that excuse.
[03:39:27.168 --> 03:39:29.391]  Now, you go fight the New World Order.
[03:39:29.391 --> 03:39:31.293]  You know it's coming down on you.
[03:39:31.293 --> 03:39:32.815]  You know this is real.
[03:39:32.815 --> 03:39:34.637]  You know you're good.
[03:39:34.637 --> 03:39:36.339]  And so you go out and be a leader.
[03:39:36.339 --> 03:39:38.922]  And when you get attacked, then you'll understand.
[03:39:39.884 --> 03:39:41.965]  We need to reach everybody now.
[03:39:41.965 --> 03:39:43.606]  We need to reach out now.
[03:39:43.606 --> 03:39:48.468]  We need to understand that whoever's being attacked is who is effective and who is good.
[03:39:48.468 --> 03:39:55.650]  Now, I'm done talking about that, but I just have seen particular attacks on our two guests, and I know their work's good.
[03:39:55.650 --> 03:39:58.952]  I've been watching them for years, researching them for years.
[03:39:58.952 --> 03:40:00.492]  Everything they do is good.
[03:40:00.492 --> 03:40:01.333]  The fruits are good.
[03:40:02.213 --> 03:40:03.634]  That's how you judge a tree.
[03:40:03.634 --> 03:40:10.760]  But there's these horrible sick trees with poison on them that always flap their branches and attack anybody who's good.
[03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:14.082]  It's time to see through the mind control.
[03:40:14.082 --> 03:40:15.423]  Let's go to Tiffany in Connecticut.
[03:40:15.423 --> 03:40:16.404]  You're on the air with our guest.
[03:40:16.404 --> 03:40:16.864]  Go ahead.
[03:40:16.864 --> 03:40:18.746]  Hi.
[03:40:18.746 --> 03:40:26.572]  I'm actually a nurse and I just wanted to say that I just can't even imagine how many flu shots that I've given
[03:40:28.158 --> 03:40:42.828]  It makes me stressed out when I'm listening to this to think about how many people, because even in nursing school, we were required to go out to grocery stores, to nursing homes, to places like that, and just give flu shot after flu shot after flu shot after flu shot under the guise of, you know, practicing to give IM shots.
[03:40:42.828 --> 03:40:50.674]  And then once I got a job out of school, the hospitals got huge, huge fines for every patient that left the hospital without a flu shot.
[03:40:51.158 --> 03:40:56.580]  So every single person we were required to ask, and if they said they hadn't had the flu shot, we were required to give it to them.
[03:40:56.580 --> 03:40:57.400]  And see, let me stop you.
[03:40:57.400 --> 03:40:58.080]  That's a key.
[03:40:58.080 --> 03:41:03.882]  It's admitted that schools get bonus money if they forcibly inoculate, they get fined if they don't.
[03:41:03.882 --> 03:41:09.703]  Same thing with hospitals, but the general public doesn't know this, so now they're forcibly... I mean, it's now happened.
[03:41:09.703 --> 03:41:16.325]  They are now forcibly injecting kids nationwide, and it's a non-issue, except when they collapse and go to the hospital.
[03:41:16.325 --> 03:41:18.386]  Go ahead, then I want to get Dr. Labo to comment on this.
[03:41:19.557 --> 03:41:23.279]  Okay, but I was talking to my friend last night.
[03:41:23.279 --> 03:41:24.600]  I was telling him about everything.
[03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:29.362]  He had no idea about anything that you've ever said, anything that you've ever done.
[03:41:29.362 --> 03:41:44.711]  So I'm talking to him about everything, and come to find out he has a nine-month-old daughter, and then I just kind of randomly spill over and start talking about the flu shot and, you know, all of the negatives about it, and he says, oh my God, I just got my daughter the flu shot.
[03:41:44.711 --> 03:41:46.732]  You know, she's nine months old, and I'm like, oops.
[03:41:47.512 --> 03:41:48.292]  I don't think so.
[03:42:08.809 --> 03:42:11.091]  About the, like, forced malnourishment.
[03:42:11.091 --> 03:42:12.452]  You know, what can we do?
[03:42:12.452 --> 03:42:14.213]  Like, what do I tell him to do?
[03:42:14.213 --> 03:42:17.575]  And what should I do when it comes to... Yeah, not just politically.
[03:42:17.575 --> 03:42:26.722]  If somebody's had the squalene shots or the mercury-infilled shots, what can they do to detoxify Dr. Labo, General Stubblebine?
[03:42:26.722 --> 03:42:30.564]  Well, unfortunately, the shots are very complicated.
[03:42:30.564 --> 03:42:33.767]  And if they've had the squalene-filled shots, they...
[03:42:35.028 --> 03:42:38.049]  Detoxifying is very difficult.
[03:42:38.049 --> 03:42:44.832]  However, the immune system is weakened by these shots, all of them, with or without squalene.
[03:42:44.832 --> 03:42:54.796]  And so what you need to do is get yourself some nanosilver, not colloidal silver, nanosilver, and start taking it on a regular basis.
[03:42:54.796 --> 03:42:58.318]  For a baby, half a teaspoon once a day.
[03:42:58.318 --> 03:43:00.679]  For a toddler or a grown-up,
[03:43:02.219 --> 03:43:07.823]  A teaspoon once or twice a day and start rebuilding your immune system.
[03:43:07.823 --> 03:43:12.065]  It does not kill the beneficial bacteria that are part of your immune system.
[03:43:12.065 --> 03:43:21.430]  The second, and by the way, there's a hearing going on that the EPA is holding this week, a three-day hearing to take silver off the market.
[03:43:21.430 --> 03:43:28.454]  One of the things that we're asking people to do is to take action items on our website, healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:43:31.315 --> 03:43:34.477]  Well, it's the repeated injury too, isn't it?
[03:43:34.477 --> 03:43:36.078]  Thank you for the call, ma'am.
[03:43:36.078 --> 03:43:38.319]  Any comments to Tiffany General Stubblebine?
[03:43:59.994 --> 03:44:04.598]  The other thing is that you must then never again take any more vaccines.
[03:44:04.598 --> 03:44:07.101]  Ever.
[03:44:07.101 --> 03:44:11.945]  Or give them.
[03:44:11.945 --> 03:44:12.586]  Absolutely.
[03:44:12.586 --> 03:44:15.068]  We're going to take a few more calls.
[03:44:15.068 --> 03:44:22.976]  I forgot one other side issue I wanted to bring up before we take a few final calls with General Stubblebine and of course Dr. Labo.
[03:44:22.976 --> 03:44:23.396]  And that is
[03:44:24.997 --> 03:44:32.702]  I meant to ask you about this during a break, but I'll just ask you here live on air, General, and if you don't want to get into it, that's fine, but I'm interested.
[03:44:32.702 --> 03:44:38.486]  Two years ago on air, I told you that John Ronson's Men Who Stare at Goats was being made into a movie.
[03:44:38.486 --> 03:44:42.068]  You knew about it and said that the book was absolute baloney.
[03:44:42.068 --> 03:44:43.669]  Now I've seen the trailer for it.
[03:44:43.669 --> 03:44:48.112]  It's a big movie with George Clooney and everybody else in it.
[03:44:48.112 --> 03:44:50.454]  Who's the guy that plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the new Star Wars?
[03:44:52.970 --> 03:44:53.671]  Why would they tell the truth?
[03:45:11.892 --> 03:45:26.771]  You know, the only thing that's going to sell is something that people can sort of affiliate with and find that it gets in their psychopathic belly.
[03:45:26.771 --> 03:45:28.553]  It's the blood and the bullfight.
[03:45:28.553 --> 03:45:29.575]  You got that right.
[03:45:30.569 --> 03:45:34.513]  So, as a matter of fact, we have not even seen the movie.
[03:45:34.513 --> 03:45:35.614]  We have no desire to.
[03:45:35.614 --> 03:45:39.859]  I haven't read the book because I have no desire to read it.
[03:45:39.859 --> 03:45:44.604]  You know, Doc, you're a major, they have a major character based on you.
[03:45:44.604 --> 03:45:44.884]  I know.
[03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:48.721]  I mean, it's a big movie.
[03:45:48.721 --> 03:45:53.564]  Secondarily, Jesse Ventura, he's told me he thinks this is more than fair.
[03:45:53.564 --> 03:45:57.826]  He thinks his new TV show leans towards our view.
[03:45:57.826 --> 03:46:01.448]  I just can't see how Time Warner is going to let it on air, but they're promoting it.
[03:46:01.448 --> 03:46:02.889]  It's coming out in December.
[03:46:02.889 --> 03:46:04.070]  You guys flew to the U.S.
[03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:05.091]  to be interviewed.
[03:46:05.091 --> 03:46:07.872]  I recommended you be interviewed for the show.
[03:46:07.872 --> 03:46:13.736]  And, you know, I trust Jesse, but, boy, I tell you, it's going to be interesting to see what's in this TV show.
[03:46:14.514 --> 03:46:20.802]  You know, we wouldn't go back to the United States to be interviewed by him until we had spoken to him personally.
[03:46:20.802 --> 03:46:26.430]  And I was convinced that he was a decent man and was not going to do a hatchet job.
[03:46:26.430 --> 03:46:28.212]  We flew back to the United States.
[03:46:28.212 --> 03:46:31.616]  We had an extremely pleasant day with him.
[03:46:33.343 --> 03:46:34.824]  He's a truly good person.
[03:46:34.824 --> 03:46:41.386]  By the way, he's quite open about the fact that he has a vaccine-injured child, so he understands about vaccines.
[03:46:41.386 --> 03:46:44.387]  And he promised he would not do a hatchet job.
[03:46:44.387 --> 03:46:49.489]  Now the question is, what happens on the cutting room floor beyond his control?
[03:46:49.489 --> 03:46:50.129]  And we'll see.
[03:46:50.129 --> 03:46:59.653]  If a hatchet job does take place, we'll know that Time Warner basically used him in a setup.
[03:46:59.653 --> 03:47:00.073]  We'll see.
[03:47:01.633 --> 03:47:15.005]  Absolutely, and I know a lot of the inside baseball, so I'll be here to testify to whatever goes on, but I think the establishment now, though, is just admitting so much, it's almost like they're throwing it in our face.
[03:47:15.005 --> 03:47:15.926]  So, who knows?
[03:47:15.926 --> 03:47:24.414]  But it's called conspiracy theory, and it is coming out December 2nd.
[03:47:24.414 --> 03:47:26.276]  I was very impressed by Jesse.
[03:47:27.162 --> 03:47:40.713]  Yeah, no, I mean, I've never talked about that on air, but I do know that he has a vaccine-damaged child, and that's the wake-up call for people, that this stuff's real, and people better get up off their butts and do the research.
[03:47:40.713 --> 03:47:42.635]  Let's talk to Todd in Georgia.
[03:47:42.635 --> 03:47:44.176]  Todd, you're on the air.
[03:47:44.176 --> 03:47:45.337]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[03:47:45.337 --> 03:47:53.264]  I feel like I'm the only person that's not under this mass hypnosis, this incredibly strong spell that
[03:47:53.920 --> 03:48:12.039]  All the people in my class are in, I'm in school and I'm forced to take American government and I'm sitting there like wow this is all BS but I'm trying to get everybody I'm a pissed off and determined warrior and I just want to know if they're going to do something that's I guess reminiscent of Adolf Hitler times and all that which I totally believe.
[03:48:12.039 --> 03:48:16.164]  Yeah but this is more of a scientific dictatorship.
[03:48:19.168 --> 03:48:21.611]  Well, first of all, they're obviously the Gorbalists.
[03:48:39.676 --> 03:48:49.039]  There are people who believe in genocide that do not want 90% of the population living.
[03:48:49.039 --> 03:49:01.803]  They want to control all of the resources of the world, and they are bound and determined to use multiple systems
[03:49:04.540 --> 03:49:11.687]  To eliminate all of the useless eaters, which is what they call us.
[03:49:11.687 --> 03:49:17.252]  I don't know whether, Todd, whether you think you're a useless eater, but I know damn well I'm not.
[03:49:17.252 --> 03:49:21.035]  And neither is Dr. Labo.
[03:49:21.035 --> 03:49:27.141]  But they would like all of the useless eaters to just kind of disappear from the world.
[03:49:29.854 --> 03:49:42.402]  And if you think that this is not planned, if you think that this is not very well thought out, and if you think they don't have the resources to do it, you're dreaming.
[03:49:43.988 --> 03:49:48.551]  Absolutely, and I've studied their systems of incrementally beta testing things.
[03:49:48.551 --> 03:50:00.478]  It's clear that the beta testing is over, and all the horrors before were just beta tests, that the $200 million killed by governments funded by this banking syndicate last century was only a test.
[03:50:00.478 --> 03:50:04.041]  We are now seeing the launch of their real operation.
[03:50:04.041 --> 03:50:06.542]  Do you agree with that, Dr. Labo and General Stubble?
[03:50:06.542 --> 03:50:07.743]  Absolutely.
[03:50:07.743 --> 03:50:10.445]  I don't believe that either the SARS
[03:50:11.085 --> 03:50:29.377]  Incident or the avian flu re-engineered and weaponized or the swine flu bioengineered or the Ukrainian pneumonic plague episode were intended to not kill large numbers of people.
[03:50:29.377 --> 03:50:38.884]  I think they misfired and these people have had to backfill and correct and now I think they're getting better and better at what they're doing and in the absence
[03:50:39.404 --> 03:50:40.205]  I don't know.

[03:51:49.511 --> 03:51:52.492]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:52.492 --> 03:51:54.493]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:54.493 --> 03:51:55.634]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.628 --> 03:52:15.650]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.650 --> 03:52:21.692]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.692 --> 03:52:26.895]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.895 --> 03:52:36.880]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:39.342]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.342 --> 03:52:40.923]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.923 --> 03:52:43.385]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.385 --> 03:52:45.526]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.526 --> 03:52:50.670]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.670 --> 03:52:59.777]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.116 --> 03:53:04.278]  Sometimes authorities don't tell the truth.
[03:53:04.278 --> 03:53:08.461]  Many businesses, traffic intersections, and patrol cars are now equipped with cameras.
[03:53:08.461 --> 03:53:13.404]  Big Brother is watching, but now you can watch Big Brother back without Big Brother even knowing it.

[03:54:15.689 --> 03:54:19.151]  Kathy in New Orleans, you're on the air with General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo.
[03:54:19.151 --> 03:54:19.532]  Go ahead.
[03:54:20.458 --> 03:54:21.598]  Hi, Dr. Rima.
[03:54:21.598 --> 03:54:23.139]  This is Kathy from New Orleans.
[03:54:23.139 --> 03:54:25.520]  I speak to you often.
[03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:27.541]  We were wondering why we couldn't get in touch with you.
[03:54:27.541 --> 03:54:28.861]  We didn't know you were in Germany.
[03:54:28.861 --> 03:54:34.884]  I'm with Gary King of Patriot Radio in New Orleans, and Dr. Rima talks to us weekly.
[03:54:34.884 --> 03:54:35.904]  Well, that's fantastic.
[03:54:35.904 --> 03:54:37.465]  Do you have a question or comment for her?
[03:54:37.465 --> 03:54:38.706]  We're almost out of time.
[03:54:38.706 --> 03:54:48.650]  Well, I wanted to know, a couple weeks ago, you had said that something about Kathleen Sebelius was going to call off the pandemic.
[03:54:48.650 --> 03:54:49.370]  What happened?
[03:54:49.898 --> 03:54:52.059]  With that.
[03:54:52.059 --> 03:54:54.160]  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear what your question was.
[03:54:54.160 --> 03:54:57.862]  She said Kathleen Sebelius was going to do something with the pandemic.
[03:54:57.862 --> 03:55:00.383]  Oh, she did, as a matter of fact.
[03:55:00.383 --> 03:55:05.965]  Kathleen Sebelius has been approving vaccines that are illegal.
[03:55:05.965 --> 03:55:10.767]  That's why we're suing her tomorrow for her first hearing.
[03:55:10.767 --> 03:55:18.451]  And she's also been releasing squalene under an emergency authorization use.
[03:55:19.711 --> 03:55:22.433]  Which, I'm sorry, an emergency use authorization.
[03:55:22.433 --> 03:55:23.895]  Totally illegal.
[03:55:23.895 --> 03:55:31.341]  And she has been given control of the country, essentially, by Obama's National Health Emergency.
[03:55:31.341 --> 03:55:35.164]  Which again is a drill to train us in the future to go under the control.
[03:55:35.164 --> 03:55:36.985]  We'll talk more about that next week.
[03:55:36.985 --> 03:55:37.886]  Thank you, Kathy.
[03:55:37.886 --> 03:55:39.167]  Thank you so much.
[03:55:39.167 --> 03:55:40.548]  Anne in Iowa, you're on the air.
[03:55:40.548 --> 03:55:42.129]  Moving quick to get these final callers in.
[03:55:42.129 --> 03:55:42.490]  Go ahead.
[03:55:43.513 --> 03:55:45.515]  Yeah, hey, hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:55:45.515 --> 03:55:51.099]  I'd like to express extreme gratitude to you all for the hard work you do.
[03:55:51.099 --> 03:55:54.522]  I know we're talking about all these problems and it's pure evil.
[03:55:54.522 --> 03:56:06.012]  It makes me shake sometimes, but there seems to be a solution to all the things we're talking about, and it's in plain sight, and it's funny that... Exactly, but at least you can recognize evil.
[03:56:06.012 --> 03:56:09.014]  What's wrong is people that aren't upset by it.
[03:56:09.014 --> 03:56:11.116]  It's the same thing that Pope Innocent...
[03:56:13.015 --> 03:56:19.020]  outlawed when he did his so-called health care reform too, and it's cannabis.
[03:56:19.020 --> 03:56:28.629]  It seems that the cannabinoids, the endocannabinoids, is nature's way of controlling the inflammation from the fluids.
[03:56:28.629 --> 03:56:36.696]  Well, let me jump fast then, Ann, because I want to go to Paul in closing and say about a General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo, but cannabis, does it have a lot of good medical attributes?
[03:56:38.364 --> 03:56:39.184]  It does.
[03:56:39.184 --> 03:56:44.966]  It also has some neurological problems associated with it when it's smoked.
[03:56:44.966 --> 03:57:00.689]  Now, one of the reasons it's being so viciously attacked is that the pharmaceutical industry is in the process of synthesizing and patenting it, so it's bad when people access it on their own, even if it's licensed, but it's good when they can sell it to you.
[03:57:00.689 --> 03:57:01.370]  All right.
[03:57:01.370 --> 03:57:03.490]  Let's talk to Paul in Oregon.
[03:57:03.490 --> 03:57:06.211]  Quickly, Paul, we're almost out of time.
[03:57:06.211 --> 03:57:07.311]  Thanks for having me.
[03:57:08.154 --> 03:57:09.836]  I just want to make a couple quick comments.
[03:57:09.836 --> 03:57:12.878]  My grandfather just took the swine flu shot.
[03:57:12.878 --> 03:57:14.379]  He told me he was forced to take it.
[03:57:14.379 --> 03:57:15.621]  He goes to the VA hospital.
[03:57:15.621 --> 03:57:16.681]  He's a veteran.
[03:57:16.681 --> 03:57:24.829]  He was basically scared into taking it by everyone from the receptionist to the nurse and to the doctor who was seeing him.
[03:57:24.829 --> 03:57:30.554]  He had leg tremors for a week and a half afterwards, could not walk, could not get out of bed.
[03:57:30.554 --> 03:57:33.176]  He is finally semi back to normal.
[03:57:33.761 --> 03:57:39.263]  He's in his 80s, and I think this is probably going to be the beginning of a very bad last couple of years.
[03:57:39.263 --> 03:57:44.024]  Hey, listen, local talk show host, Dale Dudley got paralyzed from a flu shot.
[03:57:44.024 --> 03:57:46.925]  I mean, I know people, and thank God it came back.
[03:57:46.925 --> 03:57:52.266]  They said it was Guillain-Barré, or Gillian-Barré in English.
[03:57:52.266 --> 03:57:54.427]  Final comments from our guest on that.
[03:57:54.427 --> 03:57:56.628]  I mean, this is a vaccine cult.
[03:57:56.628 --> 03:57:59.789]  These people are vicious, General, the way they push it on us.
[03:57:59.789 --> 03:58:00.769]  They're the cultists.
[03:58:01.892 --> 03:58:09.837]  Absolutely, and I really feel sorry for you, for your grandfather that got scared into that.
[03:58:09.837 --> 03:58:18.642]  Yeah, it would have been very, very nice if he just told them to go to hell and walked out or driven out or whatever.
[03:58:18.642 --> 03:58:20.623]  But I guess it's too late now.
[03:58:20.623 --> 03:58:23.485]  He's got to take silver, nano silver.
[03:58:23.485 --> 03:58:26.747]  Say no, say no, say no, say no.
[03:58:28.413 --> 03:58:30.795]  My God, I know people all over the place.
[03:58:30.795 --> 03:58:32.596]  I mean, it's just hurting everybody.
[03:58:32.596 --> 03:58:38.620]  And these murderers are running around with their cult members with their injectors like body snatchers saying you must take it.
[03:58:38.620 --> 03:58:40.001]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:40.001 --> 03:58:41.423]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:41.423 --> 03:58:43.904]  Great job, crew.

[03:58:51.414 --> 03:58:54.796]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.796 --> 03:58:58.419]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.419 --> 03:59:03.002]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:03.002 --> 03:59:08.586]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.866 --> 03:59:13.649]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.649 --> 03:59:17.272]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.272 --> 03:59:22.095]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.095 --> 03:59:28.659]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.659 --> 03:59:30.601]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.081 --> 03:59:33.242]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
