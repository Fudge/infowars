[00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.891]  31% bigger in the north and the south.
[00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:07.373]  Record increase in its size because the sun cooled off the last two years.
[00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:12.816]  Right, and I think what I think is happening is, I mean, this is for hundreds of miles.
[00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:14.777]  This is ice, you know, clean, clean.
[00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:19.760]  It looks like a, it just totally looks like somebody just cut out with a bulldozer for miles and miles.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.122]  But I mean... I just don't think those chemical lasers have that much power.
[00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:29.579]  It's also a theory on if there's any satellite-based lasers.
[00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.220]  There's a lot of suppressed technology.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.600]  I just stick with what I can prove.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.220]  Right, I agree.
[00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.601]  That just kind of sparked my attention, but I also wanted to talk about the Tea Party last week.
[00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:41.882]  I was out there.
[00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:45.562]  I handed out over 100 Obama deceptions in 15 minutes.
[00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:48.403]  Good job.
[00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.804]  There was a provocateur, the police undercover.
[00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:52.604]  He actually filmed me.
[00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:59.591]  You know, spieling my deal on liberty and, uh, you know, he thought we had a flag and he says, why don't you go burn that flag?
[00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.731]  You guys are a bunch of socialists.
[00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:01.491]  Why are you even here?
[00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:04.052]  Why are you wasting your time arguing about this stuff?
[00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:04.972]  You guys are a bunch of socialists.
[00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:05.752]  Go start a riot.
[00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:06.533]  Go start a riot.
[00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:07.633]  You're not filming me on this.
[00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.934]  And, uh, I was just like, you know, man, I'm here for liberty.
[00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:15.025]  The flag, I represent this flag, the flag right now is under corruption.
[00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:23.609]  Well he's threatened by freedom, he's a parasite, he believes in the state and the government, but I hope you send me that footage because I want to put some of that in the new Obama film I'm making.
[00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.092]  I'm actually, I'm stocking up on footage on, you know, protest stuff like that and also
[00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.691]  Doing a lot of footage on chemtrails and all that stuff and I'm going to be sending a lot of... Good.
[00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:35.451]  Don't forget.
[00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.152]  Don't forget.
[00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:37.632]  Mail it to us right now, okay?
[00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:39.993]  Alright, I'll get on that.
[00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:40.994]  I'll definitely do that for you.
[00:01:41.274 --> 00:01:42.595]  Yeah, don't wait and not get it done.
[00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:43.295]  Thank you so much.
[00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:43.775]  Appreciate the call.
[00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:44.095]  No problem.
[00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:44.916]  You bet.
[00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:46.717]  Let's talk to Steve in Georgia.
[00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:47.937]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:01:47.957 --> 00:01:48.317]  Go ahead.
[00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:50.018]  Hey Alex, this is Steve.
[00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:51.079]  Hi.
[00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.122]  I just asked you to be kind with me because I did have an experimental fluoride treatment back in 1963, so hopefully I'm coherent.
[00:01:58.735 --> 00:01:59.836]  It was back in first grade.
[00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.736]  Oh, actually, where's that photo of me?
[00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:02.737]  I said I was going to show that.
[00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:05.338]  Where's the photo of where I'm getting the fluoride treatment?
[00:02:05.798 --> 00:02:06.799]  It's around here somewhere.
[00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.539]  Go ahead.
[00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:08.299]  Here I am.
[00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.601]  We found a photo of where I'm getting a fluoride treatment.
[00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:11.881]  Go ahead.
[00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:12.701]  That's funny.
[00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.482]  That was back in first grade.
[00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:21.505]  I still remember the taste and the instructions and the two cold chairs and the two nurses in a grade school being given that treatment.
[00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:22.786]  I still don't understand why I got it.
[00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:27.548]  Anyway, I've got a combat zone field report for you just north of Atlanta.
[00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:34.212]  I really think the minions of tyranny are literally going to come to my front door and it's going to be in the next two days.
[00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:47.506]  I got a note, I live in a 400 home subdivision north of Atlanta, and I got a note from my homeowner's association indicating that a census worker would be stopping by my home.
[00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:51.410]  And what it reads, can I say the census worker's name?
[00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:52.588]  I guess I can.
[00:02:52.908 --> 00:03:00.052]  Anyway, the note says, Census worker Mr. Wallerstein is in the community to verify street addresses for the next day or so.
[00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:09.216]  Mr. Wallerstein will have to take a GPS signal close to the front doors on a handheld computer to perform this task.
[00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:13.358]  Okay, so, you know, I've been listening to you for a while.
[00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.439]  This is coming home right now.
[00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.341]  There's no... Well, you know, I mean, do you know what your zip code is?
[00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:27.957]  Yeah, it's a GPS, you know, whatever Pentagon... Originally, it's a Pentagon Artillery Air Strike Coordination Code.
[00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:28.597]  Right.
[00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:29.237]  That's a fact.
[00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:30.138]  Right.
[00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:38.122]  And then the added number on the end of it is the full code, and then they now have the GPS system, and under law, they're only allowed to ask how many people live there.
[00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:39.042]  Exactly.
[00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:45.126]  Okay, but now most people are getting 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, some 100 question ones.
[00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:46.286]  How many guns do you own?
[00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.728]  They're asking, how much money do you have?
[00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:51.049]  What type of toilet do you have?
[00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.071]  Training, you know, they'll bang on the door, it happened to me, and they'll go, answer my question!
[00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:58.032]  And I said, listen, get off my property or I'm gonna call the police, pal.
[00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.274]  They did the same thing to me, that type of thing.
[00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:04.496]  But my issue is, they're taking a GPS signal of my front door, okay?
[00:04:05.103 --> 00:04:07.085]  So, I'm going to escort again.
[00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:11.129]  They made a mistake because they let me know and I've alerted all my neighbors.
[00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.492]  You know, escort this guy off your property nicely.
[00:04:14.872 --> 00:04:16.033]  Tell him never to come back.
[00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:19.336]  I mean, he can't come on my property, right?
[00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:22.239]  It's not legal for him to walk up there.
[00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.163]  Well, you must have, you probably waived your rights under the Homeowners Association rule.
[00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:31.247]  So through a contract, if their contract says that, he can.
[00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:34.897]  Well, I don't know if it would have been in there.
[00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:37.118]  I mean, this neighborhood's been around for about 30 years.
[00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:38.699]  I don't know.
[00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:41.300]  You have to look at the covenant.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.843]  A lot of times when they change stuff, they'll say, by paying your yearly dues, you agree to the new rules of the covenant.
[00:04:47.063 --> 00:04:53.206]  If you'd like to see that, talk to the homeowners association manager, Bill, who steals half the money.
[00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:55.907]  That's what they usually do.
[00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:57.808]  But you can go find out there more about it.
[00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:27.077]  uh... but no i mean this is this is this is literally control and so that's a swat team guys in the dark but they are foreign troops whatever which they now admit that he's foreign troops in america's now mainstream is like any any any any any i don't know where i got out there is like and i'm not going to have a lot and i was like running around your door with the swat teams or they can send their robots i've got that in reuters hunter-killer robots eighty wheelers pull up that a robotic this is the hunter-killer swords offload
[00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:30.546]  You can come right up to your door.
[00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:31.286]  That's what it's all about.
[00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:31.966]  It's all about the freedom.
[00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:33.467]  People think I'm joking about that.
[00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:34.187]  It's serious.
[00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:41.271]  No, Steve Quill talked about the Orange Alert on your show the other day or whatever, and I was wondering, you know, how are they going to round up a bunch of special ops guys?
[00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:43.592]  You know, are they going to do it one day at a time?
[00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:44.392]  That isn't going to work.
[00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:48.214]  They're going to have to dispatch people via GPS signals.
[00:05:48.254 --> 00:05:49.855]  They're not going to mess with addresses.
[00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:50.575]  Oh, you're right.
[00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:53.396]  In fact, and oh, great, great point, and I appreciate your call.
[00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:54.117]  Let me just add this.
[00:05:55.555 --> 00:06:06.105]  I remember, again, 16, 17 years ago, Alexander Haig, big globalist, had a cable TV show that aired around the country.
[00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:08.807]  He would pay to have it aired on county cable channels.
[00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:18.937]  And I would sit there, my last year in high school I was here in Austin, and I would watch Alexander Haig when I got home about 6 o'clock after working out after school.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.662]  And he said, we're going to have these huge blimps, solar-powered, surveilling all the cities.
[00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:26.584]  They're much cheaper than satellites and they're below the cloud cover.
[00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:27.445]  They work much better.
[00:06:28.405 --> 00:06:33.988]  Or they're below, you know, the atmospheric zone at about 90,000 feet.
[00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:36.230]  And he was explaining all of this.
[00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.471]  And then I saw documents later.
[00:06:38.447 --> 00:06:50.013]  And then now they admit they have big blimps at 95,000 feet, surveilling, scanning, reading, ground-penetrating radar, face-scanning cameras, heat signature cameras that track you off your heat signature.
[00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:54.235]  You know, they get a heat signature on the ground from you with your name ID'd.
[00:06:54.275 --> 00:07:00.519]  Like they can have a camera aimed... In fact, they admit they have the MIT Braggs, they have these integration systems.
[00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:01.119]  Here's how it works.
[00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:02.940]  This is one way it works.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.822]  They'll have a camera that scans your driver's license.
[00:07:09.602 --> 00:07:14.947]  Well, it ties your face, your digital face, with the digital driver's license photo.
[00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:21.694]  Now, the camera scans your license plate and ties that to your driver's license database.
[00:07:21.994 --> 00:07:26.299]  The same camera, the same computers, then matches your face getting out of the car.
[00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:29.202]  You understand how this works?
[00:07:30.987 --> 00:07:32.549]  Hey guys, can you keep it down out there?
[00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.551]  Let's not have big discussions right outside.
[00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:35.952]  I'm trying to think here.
[00:07:35.992 --> 00:07:37.293]  I'm trying to keep focused, okay?
[00:07:38.094 --> 00:07:41.497]  Do they even hear me or are they just going to keep going on outside the door?
[00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:43.680]  Sir, hold on just a minute.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.301]  Is that same caller still there?
[00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:47.023]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.822]  I got so much going on in my head, I just can't keep track of this anymore.
[00:07:55.023 --> 00:07:56.764]  And I know the caller had more he wanted to say.
[00:07:56.784 --> 00:07:57.705]  That was actually a new caller.
[00:07:57.725 --> 00:07:59.346]  You can call back in if you can get in, sir.
[00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:00.207]  I just can't do it.
[00:08:01.328 --> 00:08:10.655]  I mean, because what happens is I start listening from radio to what people are doing, and they get right outside the door and have really loud discussions, and then it totally short circuits what I'm thinking and what I'm saying.
[00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:13.137]  Let me try to start over, okay?
[00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:14.999]  I'm going to start over right now for folks on air.
[00:08:16.584 --> 00:08:19.666]  What they do is they have your digital photo from when you get the driver's license.
[00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:23.268]  Then they have cameras that are also reading your car license plate.
[00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:26.610]  And so that's a secondary way to ID you.
[00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:41.919]  When you get out of the car, the face scanning camera on the ground, designed and put in by DARPA, IDs your digital photo with the face scan off of the database they have, ties it in with the car and the license plate, confirming that's you.
[00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:46.933]  Then, when they're wanting to track a subject, the blimp has...
[00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:51.032]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear
[00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:22.466]  After this, have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:09:22.746 --> 00:09:25.167]  The answer you're looking for is The Bailout Group.

[00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.390]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.130]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:26.612]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:11:27.213 --> 00:11:33.375]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:35.636]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:38.198]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:11:38.278 --> 00:11:49.244]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:11:49.844 --> 00:11:51.145]  It's not about left or right.
[00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:52.906]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:59.610]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:09.689]  The Obama Deception.
[00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:11.310]  The people strike back!
[00:12:13.456 --> 00:12:15.316]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:22.118]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:12:22.398 --> 00:12:30.580]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.521]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:38.482]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.704]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:45.107]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:47.369]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:55.315]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:57.336]  So, bottom line today.
[00:13:22.347 --> 00:13:24.210]  Have the blimps IDing everybody.
[00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.231]  They admit it.
[00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:26.553]  And tracking everywhere you go.
[00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:29.898]  And the million plus people on the no-fly list.
[00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:32.962]  And the total control grid going into place right now.
[00:13:34.684 --> 00:13:35.726]  So I thought I'd get into this.
[00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:37.648]  They're converting the entire military
[00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:46.448]  They've got 18 wheelers they admit that are robotic, that can drive from one end of the country to the other and make decisions.
[00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:52.351]  But normally they have a controller who's also in there through the cameras, you know, in a simulator to take it over if there's a problem.
[00:13:52.812 --> 00:13:57.754]  It pulls up, the bottom lowers down, 15 killer robots get off, and they just start murdering.
[00:13:58.634 --> 00:13:59.915]  This is Reuters today.
[00:13:59.935 --> 00:14:00.435]  Reuters.
[00:14:01.136 --> 00:14:01.936]  Bigger than AP.
[00:14:03.137 --> 00:14:05.598]  Killer robots and a revolution in warfare.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.381]  They have no fear.
[00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:09.302]  They never tire.
[00:14:09.502 --> 00:14:12.244]  They are not upset when the soldier next to them gets blown to pieces.
[00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:21.453]  Their morale doesn't suffer by having to do anything, and again, their jobs, known in the military as the 3Ds, dull, dirty, and dangerous.
[00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:29.481]  They are military robots, and their rapidly increasing numbers and growing sophistication may herald the end of thousands of years of human monopoly on warfighting.
[00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:33.844]  Science fiction is moving to the battlefield.
[00:14:33.884 --> 00:14:37.456]  The future is upon us, says Brookings scholar Peter Singer.
[00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.572]  Put it in a conference of experts at the U.S.
[00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.393]  Army War College in Pennsylvania this month.
[00:14:42.954 --> 00:14:45.997]  And the entire Air Force attack craft, everything's converting.
[00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:52.963]  And I've seen the training drills, I've seen, and I've talked to troops, they say there's classified stuff you wouldn't believe, I just don't want to scare the public.
[00:14:53.703 --> 00:15:04.413]  And these, even Fox News had a piece six, seven years ago, I've got it somewhere on tape, where it shows a little hovering flying saucer and it comes up and face scans you, and if you don't show ID, it kills you.
[00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:10.769]  And so, you see stuff like, uh, They Live, where it's, Hello, my little friend!
[00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:12.050]  Aye, there you are!
[00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:16.953]  You know, and he blasted, I have come here to do two things, to kick butt and chew bubblegum.
[00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:18.935]  And I am all out of bubblegum.
[00:15:22.497 --> 00:15:22.998]  Oh, man.
[00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:24.299]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:25.940]  So, uh, that's what's happening.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.722]  And police departments around the world already sent in killer robots into the courts.
[00:15:29.742 --> 00:15:30.623]  He won't come out of the house.
[00:15:30.683 --> 00:15:31.824]  Send in the killer robot.
[00:15:32.504 --> 00:15:33.425]  And they're getting more and more.
[00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:34.446]  They used them in Fallujah.
[00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:35.747]  Got their, uh, feet wet there.
[00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:41.298]  A little bit of wet work, but the globalists don't care about the Arabs.
[00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:42.478]  They love you.
[00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:44.019]  They care about human life.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:16:02.427]  Singer published For Wired, For War, The Robotics Revolution and Conflict, 21st Century, a book that traces the rise of the machines and predicts that in the future wars they will not only play greater roles in executing missions but also in planning them.
[00:16:03.416 --> 00:16:06.517]  Numbers affect the explosive growth of robotic systems.
[00:16:07.117 --> 00:16:08.517]  Meanwhile, the government wants our guns.
[00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:10.598]  We're getting outgunned by them if they want our guns.
[00:16:11.018 --> 00:16:12.198]  Just enjoy yourselves, everybody.
[00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.779]  Numbers reflect the explosive growth of robotic systems.
[00:16:16.219 --> 00:16:16.539]  The U.S.
[00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:20.960]  forces that stormed into Iraq in 2003 had no robots on the ground.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.801]  There were none in Afghanistan either.
[00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:35.204]  Those two wars are fought with the help of an estimated 12,000 ground-based robots and 7,000 unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, the technical term for drone or robotic aircraft.
[00:16:35.564 --> 00:16:43.147]  Ground-based robots in Iraq have saved hundreds of lives in Iraq, defusing improvised explosive devices, which account for more than 40% of U.S.
[00:16:43.187 --> 00:16:43.687]  casualties.
[00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:56.688]  The first armed robot was deployed in Iraq in 2007, and it is lethal, as its acronym is long, Special Weapons Observation Remote Reconnaissance Direct Action System, SWARDS.
[00:16:57.169 --> 00:16:58.630]  By the way, they were used earlier than that.
[00:17:00.031 --> 00:17:08.398]  Like they tell you when we went into Vietnam in 1965, folks, we were there in 1959, and 4,000 troops died as advisors.
[00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:10.660]  They love lying to you.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.761]  Just drink some more fluoride, though.
[00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.562]  Remember, they care about you.
[00:17:15.336 --> 00:17:19.438]  Continuing here, it says, uh, the first armed robot was deployed in Iraq in 2007.
[00:17:20.418 --> 00:17:21.299]  It's the Sworge.
[00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.580]  It's mounted with a M249 machine gun.
[00:17:26.341 --> 00:17:29.163]  Can hit a target at 3,000 feet away with pinpoint precision.
[00:17:29.643 --> 00:17:31.804]  From the air, the best known UAV is the Predator.
[00:17:31.864 --> 00:17:33.205]  It's killed dozens of insurgents.
[00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:35.146]  Dozens of insurgents.
[00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.906]  Every week, they bomb another wedding.
[00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:40.348]  We killed 300 innocent people and might have killed one bad guy.
[00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:41.509]  But they tell you here, 12.
[00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:48.105]  It's all meant to minimize the slaves.
[00:17:48.326 --> 00:17:51.328]  And I read the British Army documents on that.
[00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:53.230]  They say we've killed thousands.
[00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.391]  We say we've killed five.
[00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:58.735]  And the human mind will automatically, when they hear the real number later of thousands, will average them together.
[00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:02.638]  A little psych warfare thing.
[00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:05.381]  Just one of many psych warfare manuals that have been declassified I've read.
[00:18:06.682 --> 00:18:10.666]  The predators are flown by operators sitting in front of television monitors and cubicles at
[00:18:12.622 --> 00:18:15.705]  Creek Air Force Base in Nevada, 8,000 miles away from Afghanistan.
[00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:17.627]  Yeah, and this is how they work.
[00:18:17.787 --> 00:18:21.210]  All these kids playing games, slaughtering people, designed by the Pentagon.
[00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.033]  They admit they're being conditioned to not care about killing.
[00:18:25.054 --> 00:18:27.456]  And so they just sit there with drones, killing women and children.
[00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:29.418]  It's all part of pleasure, and they get off on it.
[00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:31.460]  They feel good, like their life means something.
[00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.382]  I'm real manly, you know.
[00:18:33.402 --> 00:18:35.945]  I sent in a robot to kill somebody.
[00:18:38.663 --> 00:18:40.884]  And don't worry, police and military, I know you're getting off on it.
[00:18:41.284 --> 00:18:42.505]  They're going to take everything from you.
[00:18:42.525 --> 00:18:45.427]  They're going to take your lives, your bank accounts, your children.
[00:18:45.647 --> 00:18:48.348]  You're going to get all the hell you're dishing out on innocent people.
[00:18:48.689 --> 00:18:49.409]  Don't worry!
[00:18:49.449 --> 00:18:50.109]  You want evil?
[00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.490]  You want to kill 50 million of babies?
[00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:52.951]  You love the evil?
[00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:54.772]  Don't worry, you're going to get to swim in it.
[00:18:55.252 --> 00:18:56.973]  Don't worry, you're going to get everything you want!
[00:18:57.273 --> 00:18:58.334]  Everything and more!
[00:18:58.614 --> 00:18:59.435]  You like evil?
[00:18:59.595 --> 00:19:00.275]  You're going to get it!
[00:19:00.295 --> 00:19:01.676]  We'll be right back with more.
[00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:02.236]  Stay with us.
[00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:03.237]  Your call, straight ahead.
[00:19:03.837 --> 00:19:04.738]  We're on the march.
[00:19:05.218 --> 00:19:06.739]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:19:07.732 --> 00:19:10.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:15.267]  So you want to stop smoking.
[00:19:15.327 --> 00:19:16.428]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[00:19:16.608 --> 00:19:19.351]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:23.314]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[00:19:23.474 --> 00:19:27.017]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[00:19:27.238 --> 00:19:29.199]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[00:19:29.239 --> 00:19:33.203]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[00:19:33.563 --> 00:19:36.345]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.
[00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:40.209]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[00:19:40.609 --> 00:19:54.075]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke-Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, an audio support program, capsule holder, and a bottle of weight loss capsules just in case you're worried about gaining weight while you're trying to quit.
[00:19:54.275 --> 00:19:59.778]  To find out if you qualify for this free trial offer, join the tens of thousands who have quit for life with Smoke-Free.
[00:19:59.978 --> 00:20:00.498]  Call 1-800-426-6186 today.
[00:20:00.518 --> 00:20:00.858]  That's 1-800-426-6186.
[00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:11.828]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now!
[00:20:12.268 --> 00:20:19.379]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:20:20.163 --> 00:20:25.507]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:20:26.047 --> 00:20:32.231]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:34.352]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:20:34.512 --> 00:20:36.894]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:47.701]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:51.412]  It's not about left or right.
[00:20:51.812 --> 00:20:53.213]  It's about a one world government.
[00:20:53.673 --> 00:21:00.016]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:08.841 --> 00:21:10.002]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:10.422 --> 00:21:11.603]  The people strike back.
[00:21:13.464 --> 00:21:15.786]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:21:15.927 --> 00:21:19.630]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:21:19.731 --> 00:21:22.373]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:21:22.553 --> 00:21:29.741]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:34.883]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[00:21:34.964 --> 00:21:39.926]  You'll lose on your capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[00:21:40.086 --> 00:21:46.169]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:50.332]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:21:50.472 --> 00:21:55.476]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:56.297 --> 00:22:01.220]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:05.063]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:08.286]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:22:08.446 --> 00:22:08.886]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:33.052]  Yeah, this article where it's getting into the robots gives disinfo from the numbers I've seen.
[00:22:33.092 --> 00:22:35.832]  It says robotics research and development in the U.S.
[00:22:35.892 --> 00:22:40.814]  received a big push from Congress in 2001 when it set two ambitious goals.
[00:22:40.854 --> 00:22:45.175]  By 2010, a third of the country's long-range attack aircraft should be unmanned.
[00:22:45.695 --> 00:22:46.675]  The number I saw was half.
[00:22:47.336 --> 00:22:51.557]  And by 2015, one-third of America's ground combat vehicles.
[00:22:53.052 --> 00:22:54.033]  You ought to see these things.
[00:22:54.113 --> 00:23:08.411]  It's like... Well, you can just Google combat robots and I mean it's like big black tanks that are like the size of a Chevy truck with like ten guns on the nose and nerve gas sprayers and everything else and this is what the cops are going to be using on you folks.
[00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:11.034]  They're just going to go, oh, well turn your guns in.
[00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:14.268]  War Wags start rolling.
[00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:19.337]  That's why once they try to start all that, you can't be in a defensive posture waiting for them.
[00:23:19.878 --> 00:23:25.127]  And then you gotta go to the factories, the relay centers, the places where they got these terminators set up.
[00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:29.275]  It's really sick, folks.
[00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:37.118]  We've got a psycho-scientist-eugenicist working for inbred bankers who believe in eugenics, running everything, and everything's a giant kill grid.
[00:23:37.158 --> 00:23:38.618]  Everything they're setting up's a kill grid.
[00:23:39.198 --> 00:23:39.999]  It's a slaughterhouse.
[00:23:40.339 --> 00:23:43.500]  The New World Order is setting up a giant slaughterhouse for humanity.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.340]  In their own words!
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.342]  And they're practicing soft kills with the vaccines and the things they do, but they're just expanding all of this.
[00:23:52.782 --> 00:23:54.183]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:23:54.323 --> 00:23:55.423]  John in Oregon, go ahead.
[00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:57.104]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:01.894]  Um, I just actually, um, I wanted to bring up a couple things with you.
[00:24:01.934 --> 00:24:07.918]  First off, um, as far as I know, you don't have a problem with us downloading your movies off the internet for free, correct?
[00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:09.979]  No, I want people to!
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:18.825]  Okay, well, I thought I'd let you know, okay, I use BitTorrent, I use a BitTorrent client to download a couple of your movies, and, um, I thought I'd let you know that I was completely death-pinged by the U.S.
[00:24:18.865 --> 00:24:21.447]  government until my computer completely shut down.
[00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:32.031]  I mean, I have a couple different firewalls, so let me actually see the IP addresses of the people that I'm sharing with and uploading with, and several of them were... What is it?
[00:24:32.051 --> 00:24:34.994]  A couple of them were... What is it?
[00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:41.541]  FBI anti-peer-to-peer, and a couple of them, and they peered... They death-pinged my IP address so hard that...
[00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:43.045]  My whole computer just shut down.
[00:24:43.105 --> 00:24:52.607]  Well, we kept wondering why the Pirate Bay and others would have it posted with thousands of seeders and people, and then Pirate Bay would take it down themselves.
[00:24:53.387 --> 00:24:57.408]  And they're doing that because the film is the most viral film out there.
[00:24:57.428 --> 00:25:02.569]  I mean, there's little short clips and things that are more viral, like literally, you know, girls playing volleyball in bikinis.
[00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:06.289]  But for a full film, it's the most viral thing out there, everywhere.
[00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:09.470]  And no, I mean, Obama invited a blogger
[00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:15.532]  This is mainstream news for the White House that was mildly critical of him trying to co-opt them.
[00:25:15.632 --> 00:25:19.794]  I mean, Ted Anderson's running national radio ads for the Obama deception.
[00:25:20.954 --> 00:25:24.176]  Major rap groups are plugging it at huge concerts.
[00:25:24.696 --> 00:25:27.337]  And so, yes, they're trying to shut down the spread of it.
[00:25:27.897 --> 00:25:38.482]  They also like the fear that creates, so all you do is upload it ten times more and fight back because it shows who the banker... I mean, look, I'm going on air saying, arrest the bankers.
[00:25:39.102 --> 00:25:41.944]  I am literally on the front lines going, shoot me!
[00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:45.285]  And, you know, because I'm not here to lose this fight.
[00:25:46.006 --> 00:25:58.652]  I'm here to go head up against the enemy and I've asked people to give us support because do people realize we're big now and we are, we know how to counter the globalists, we are stepping up to the plate to their criminality.
[00:25:58.692 --> 00:26:01.354]  These are people that'll murder whole third world countries.
[00:26:02.054 --> 00:26:03.095]  They don't care about life.
[00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:09.960]  They just don't want to kill me and make me into a martyr so they're studying ways to destroy me in the media and other things.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.583]  And, you know, I am literally, you know, going in through and beyond.
[00:26:14.723 --> 00:26:15.284]  I am committed.
[00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.685]  But I want folks to know, this is the real world.
[00:26:17.705 --> 00:26:19.767]  They really have CIA taking over all the cities.
[00:26:19.987 --> 00:26:23.209]  They really are putting regular army in all the police departments and announcing it.
[00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:27.172]  They really are having drills for martial law with foreign troops on the FEMA website.
[00:26:27.392 --> 00:26:29.574]  Yeah, I've also noticed, since I live right next to the ocean,
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:27:02.929]  Yeah, City Council has been discussing monthly, quote, tsunami drills, but it's just, I've been noticing that it's, uh, everybody's to convene to a location, you know, deemed by the, you know, our state government.
[00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.610]  Exactly.
[00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.011]  Suddenly they have all these little disaster drills.
[00:27:06.072 --> 00:27:06.472]  Exactly.
[00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:06.772]  Go ahead.
[00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:15.239]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've just, you know, I've lived here my entire life, and I know where it's safe from a tsunami, and I don't need my government telling me where it's going to be safe.
[00:27:15.379 --> 00:27:17.861]  Again, this is the national security state.
[00:27:18.522 --> 00:27:18.682]  Yeah.
[00:27:19.454 --> 00:27:20.915]  Go find out who's running that drill.
[00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:22.876]  It'll be a 35-year-old guy.
[00:27:22.896 --> 00:27:24.177]  He'll say, hey, you were in the Army.
[00:27:24.197 --> 00:27:25.237]  He'll say, how'd you know that?
[00:27:25.578 --> 00:27:26.698]  Oh, you were in Intel.
[00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:28.119]  He'll say, did I know you?
[00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:29.520]  Oh, you were in Intel.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.581]  And go, so what's the op?
[00:27:32.202 --> 00:27:37.785]  And they'll go, ha ha ha, hey, hey, oh, hey, whoa, just being friends, ha ha ha.
[00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:39.246]  You know, that's how they work.
[00:27:40.366 --> 00:27:42.728]  And that person will usually have dual duties.
[00:27:43.008 --> 00:27:47.971]  He's there to spy on people, make sure the narcotics are coming in, just make sure everything's going well.
[00:27:48.612 --> 00:27:52.033]  Oh yeah, where I live here in Oregon, there's a huge business for methamphetamine.
[00:27:52.073 --> 00:27:53.174]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:27:54.914 --> 00:27:58.255]  They're dealing it all, yeah.
[00:27:58.635 --> 00:27:59.296]  Oh, it's horrible.
[00:28:02.037 --> 00:28:04.157]  Once the government decides to go criminal, they just go on.
[00:28:04.177 --> 00:28:05.298]  It's just total criminal.
[00:28:05.338 --> 00:28:05.998]  Everything criminal.
[00:28:06.238 --> 00:28:07.118]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:28:07.138 --> 00:28:07.839]  I'm going to jump here.
[00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.880]  Let's talk to Lucia in Canada.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.960]  Go ahead, Lucia.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.500]  You're on the air.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.761]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:13.781 --> 00:28:16.842]  I have two significant pieces of information for you.
[00:28:18.803 --> 00:28:25.844]  This goes out to Scott who continues to call your radio show telling you that chemtrails do not exist.
[00:28:26.645 --> 00:28:29.125]  I'm just getting my package ready to send to you.
[00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:44.328]  I have documents that were declassified in 1980 that show that in 1953 in Canada, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, there were aerosol tracer programs being used on the Canadian people without their consent.
[00:28:45.103 --> 00:28:50.427]  And it also explains in the document that there are areas in the United States that were also under this program.
[00:28:50.487 --> 00:28:53.069]  Yeah, they've been doing weather modifications since the 30s.
[00:28:53.650 --> 00:29:01.476]  I've interviewed the father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston, that's up on PrisonPlanet.tv, just Google it, or search it when you're there on the site.
[00:29:01.536 --> 00:29:04.038]  Oh yeah, as you say, the information is out there, you just have to look for it.
[00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:09.061]  They are doing testing, and under U.S.
[00:29:09.141 --> 00:29:19.749]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B, it says they can do chemical, biological, radiological testing if it's part of research or law enforcement.
[00:29:20.169 --> 00:29:23.192]  So they go, oh, we're just researching spraying you.
[00:29:23.792 --> 00:29:27.154]  And then the guy says, I don't believe they're dispersing it through the fans in the jet fuel.
[00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:28.375]  That's one theory.
[00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:35.139]  All we know is these trails didn't form like they are before 1995 or so, 96 on a wide scale.
[00:29:35.479 --> 00:29:45.465]  And now the president announced, oh, we're thinking about spraying the atmosphere with particula, and the very particula we said they were spraying from the test, to do this to the environment.
[00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:46.986]  And yeah, I
[00:29:48.698 --> 00:29:53.581]  I had really vicious threats on my children from multiple angles when I did the Chemtrail shows two weeks ago.
[00:29:53.641 --> 00:29:55.963]  I mean, they are really mad.
[00:29:56.803 --> 00:30:00.045]  And they email you, they call you, and they say, I'm going to stab your children.
[00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:01.706]  I'm going to come, I'm going to find them, I'm going to stab them.
[00:30:02.507 --> 00:30:04.008]  And you give it to the police and they do nothing.
[00:30:04.708 --> 00:30:06.570]  So, I mean, that's who these people are.
[00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.510]  They're very upset.
[00:30:08.071 --> 00:30:10.292]  We need more people fighting inside from yourselves.
[00:30:10.672 --> 00:30:12.053]  Listen to this second piece.
[00:30:13.054 --> 00:30:17.957]  I met last summer a well-to-do woman from British Columbia who
[00:30:18.706 --> 00:30:43.359]  Just out of nowhere in our conversation told me that a group of people within her community were so sick and tired of the billowing clouds above their city, they actually went to Transport Canada, who admitted, the official was caught off guard, admitted spraying was occurring because it was there to help Canadians
[00:30:44.017 --> 00:30:46.959]  Um, alleviate them from the radiation coming off of the sun.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:57.808]  That there was particulates being added to the fuel containing barium and aluminum salts in order to divert the sun's rays.
[00:30:58.368 --> 00:31:07.575]  So these enraged community members drew up a petition and now the petition has been sent into law that these planes are no longer to fly over their airspace.
[00:31:07.615 --> 00:31:08.876]  So I'm trying to get a hold of her.
[00:31:09.468 --> 00:31:14.691]  Just so that she can provide a video for you for my package, and she can talk about this petition.
[00:31:15.132 --> 00:31:16.893]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[00:31:17.053 --> 00:31:18.914]  I think I saw something about that in the news.
[00:31:18.954 --> 00:31:22.817]  I know folks are getting mad, and then other people are just in denial about this.
[00:31:23.057 --> 00:31:24.118]  How can you deny that?
[00:31:24.358 --> 00:31:30.442]  Just like they're in denial about, they've denied the global currency, the global bank, they denied the carbon taxes were coming.
[00:31:30.462 --> 00:31:36.286]  They just deny, deny, deny, deny, because who wants to admit we're in the middle of a eugenics war?
[00:31:37.306 --> 00:31:43.791]  We have a global elite waging war on us and the public has to wake up to the full insanity of this.
[00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:51.276]  Well, all I know is that fellow that called you last week about Battelle and the Department of Energy working with various universities on this program.
[00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.632]  Well, I looked into it, and the University of Manitoba is huge!
[00:31:55.793 --> 00:31:58.334]  They're all involved, all the big research universities.
[00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:00.756]  No, I separately researched what he was talking about.
[00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:01.836]  It's all admitted!
[00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:03.297]  That's the crazy part!
[00:32:03.317 --> 00:32:06.539]  You go, hey, they're all admitting it, and they just go, shut up, crazy person!
[00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:10.702]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:32:10.722 --> 00:32:20.528]  I'm going to put together a billboard in this city that has a picture of the spraying occurring over maybe our legislative grounds, because it happens every day.
[00:32:21.335 --> 00:32:29.001]  And I'm going to, it's going to say stop spraying us, and it's going to lead, you know, I'm trying to think of a website that they could go to.
[00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:31.802]  What would be the best website that I could have on this billboard?
[00:32:32.623 --> 00:32:35.345]  I would probably think California Skywatch is pretty darn good.
[00:32:35.365 --> 00:32:36.206]  I appreciate your call.
[00:32:36.226 --> 00:32:36.866]  Good to hear from you.
[00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:38.187]  Get us all that info.
[00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:39.148]  God bless you, Lucia.
[00:32:39.628 --> 00:32:41.489]  Anthony and Georgia, you're on the air, Anthony.
[00:32:41.529 --> 00:32:41.830]  Welcome.
[00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.070]  How you doing?
[00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:43.711]  Good.
[00:32:44.915 --> 00:32:46.879]  Well, I have two comments to make.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.682]  One, I love you so.
[00:32:48.802 --> 00:32:51.387]  My brother put me on to you about a year ago.
[00:32:51.668 --> 00:32:52.449]  Thank your brother.
[00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:55.415]  Yeah, because I mean, it was weird.
[00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.612]  You know, I would talk about Obama to him, and he was like, Obama's not to ask, and I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:33:01.072 --> 00:33:06.655]  And then he started, you know, started letting me listen to his show, and then I started doing research on my own, like any other ordinary individual should do.
[00:33:07.095 --> 00:33:15.659]  And I started seeing the patterns, and then when you said, oh yeah, Obama's gonna be president, and then he wafflingly beats McCain, I was like, yeah, this is real.
[00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:28.017]  I was listening to your show yesterday on the way home on my iPhone, and you were talking about vaccinations and how it was killing little girls, but it was very funny.
[00:33:28.057 --> 00:33:37.224]  I got a call last night from a market research company, and they were asking me... Sorry, your phone was breaking up.
[00:33:37.244 --> 00:33:37.784]  Are you still there?
[00:33:37.804 --> 00:33:38.985]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[00:33:39.806 --> 00:33:40.466]  Okay, start over.
[00:33:40.506 --> 00:33:42.208]  You got a call from a market research company.
[00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:46.231]  I got a call from a market research company asking me,
[00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:49.306]  We're good to go.
[00:34:18.095 --> 00:34:23.443]  It's crazy that I see, I see, I hear and see things like this all the time and I tell people and people just write it off.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.981]  A lot of these phone calls are propaganda.
[00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:35.344]  If you would have said you had kids, they would have told you, do you know how much they save your children from diseases and how wonderful they are?
[00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:36.605]  Are you vaccinated?
[00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:38.826]  They call those kind of push-pulls or push-calls.
[00:34:39.366 --> 00:34:41.287]  They also have automated systems that do that.
[00:34:42.368 --> 00:34:50.792]  But they're running TV ads about how vaccines are really good for you, how corn syrup's really good for you, how you're an idiot if you don't think it's good for you.
[00:34:51.052 --> 00:34:53.993]  So we're having an effect on them that they're having to counter us.
[00:34:56.098 --> 00:35:03.303]  Again, they're testing, keeping it compartmentalized, keeping their own people that are administering it in the dark, who aren't aware of what's happening.
[00:35:03.723 --> 00:35:09.628]  They're testing how to cover up the deaths, how to just, you know, just, again, turn up the background noise.
[00:35:09.988 --> 00:35:14.271]  Just incrementally increase what they're doing, so like the frog in the pot, we don't notice it.
[00:35:15.692 --> 00:35:21.076]  And when you're talking about Obama, the biggest thing to wake up the Obama supporters is, I'm not for McCain.
[00:35:21.376 --> 00:35:23.037]  I'm saying they're both puppets.
[00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:24.258]  There's two puppets, Dad.
[00:35:24.278 --> 00:35:25.439]  I would get two toy puppets.
[00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:29.121]  I'd go to the toy store, I'd get two puppets, and I'd say, Dad, which puppet do you like?
[00:35:29.582 --> 00:35:30.522]  Which puppet are you going to vote for?
[00:35:30.883 --> 00:35:32.044]  He'd say, I'm not going to vote for either puppet.
[00:35:32.064 --> 00:35:32.484]  They're puppets.
[00:35:32.504 --> 00:35:33.084]  I'd say, but wait a minute.
[00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:35.266]  Shouldn't you be looking at who's controlling the puppets?
[00:35:35.726 --> 00:35:36.646]  That's what I'm saying, Dad.
[00:35:36.686 --> 00:35:40.488]  I'm not for McCain or Obama, and that seems to get through to people.
[00:35:40.848 --> 00:35:44.289]  But they immediately, they're thinking, you're for Bush, you're for all of that.
[00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:45.289]  No, I'm not for Bush.
[00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:50.791]  I'm trying to explain there on the... Maybe explain to your dad, like, he knows Don King rigs a lot of fights, right?
[00:35:51.431 --> 00:35:51.631]  Yeah.
[00:35:52.512 --> 00:35:54.492]  Well, say, Dad, why is boxing dead?
[00:35:54.512 --> 00:35:59.634]  Because Don King took it over, created a monopoly, and everybody knows it's a fraud now.
[00:36:00.822 --> 00:36:01.342]  Yes it is.
[00:36:01.362 --> 00:36:03.504]  It trips me out a lot, because like you just said,
[00:36:22.273 --> 00:36:26.896]  If I didn't vote for Obama 20, a lot of people ask me who I voted for when they find out that I didn't vote for Obama.
[00:36:26.956 --> 00:36:28.177]  I'm like, oh, you voted for McCain.
[00:36:28.237 --> 00:36:29.939]  I'm like, well, I didn't vote for McCain either.
[00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:31.640]  So they're talking, well, who did you vote for?
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.681]  And then I name my candidate and they're like, who is that?
[00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:37.584]  I'm like, did you do your research on all that was running?
[00:36:37.604 --> 00:36:39.946]  And they're like, well, and I'm like, see, that's your problem.
[00:36:39.986 --> 00:36:43.448]  You automatically think, oh, if I'm not a Democrat, I must be a Republican.
[00:36:43.488 --> 00:36:46.831]  And if I'm not a Republican, I must be a Democrat.
[00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:48.292]  But, you know,
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.022]  That's how it is in Georgia.
[00:36:51.122 --> 00:36:53.063]  It's a big Obama town.
[00:36:53.083 --> 00:36:54.004]  I'm from Atlanta also.
[00:36:54.584 --> 00:36:56.205]  And also, I bought your DVD.
[00:36:56.325 --> 00:36:57.386]  I made a lot of copies.
[00:36:57.446 --> 00:36:59.708]  I'm passing out the people that work into my friends.
[00:36:59.768 --> 00:37:03.330]  And you know, I actually, I woke up two people not too long ago.
[00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:09.955]  We watched the DVD at their house and they were like, oh my God, you're like, it's funny because you were telling me all this stuff and now he's starting to see the things I see.
[00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:17.731]  And the things that I hear from you, I'm starting to hear, you know, he's starting to see more of that, and I'm like, see, it's called opening your eyes.
[00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:24.138]  Instead of just listening to Fox News or CNN, it's called doing your research, seeing what else is out there instead of mainstream media.
[00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:27.534]  Well, I also predicted, because it wasn't hard to predict, it's how they operate.
[00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:29.857]  They're going to have racist attack Obama.
[00:37:30.317 --> 00:37:33.501]  They'll probably have attempts on him by, you know, buck-toothed Klan people.
[00:37:34.302 --> 00:37:37.385]  They're going to hype that up, even if it isn't racist, it's just a tea party.
[00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:43.972]  They're going to say it is, to get everybody going, well, he isn't perfect, but the racists don't like him, so I'm going to be for him.
[00:37:44.793 --> 00:37:46.174]  Hi Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:38:05.422 --> 00:38:07.504]  I got a couple things real quick I want to get out of the way.
[00:38:07.764 --> 00:38:11.928]  First, I do want to say I want to make a little bit of a prediction.
[00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:21.217]  It's not that much of a prediction, but I think if they stage a false flag attack, they're going to get a guy and they're going to say he went to a tea party.
[00:38:21.698 --> 00:38:22.579]  That's something they're going to do.
[00:38:22.975 --> 00:38:23.755]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:38:24.275 --> 00:38:31.198]  And anytime somebody shoots a cop, they'll look at the thousand websites they visited and they'll find the one Patriot site and say, we made them kill everybody.
[00:38:31.818 --> 00:38:32.618]  And, uh, oh yeah.
[00:38:32.858 --> 00:38:38.460]  I mean, you heard the caller earlier and I've told people that saw this stuff where you'd have provocateurs there trying to start fights.
[00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:41.121]  Uh, you know, just amazing.
[00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:42.482]  Oh yeah.
[00:38:42.902 --> 00:38:47.423]  And, um, I had called you before and told you about this website, but I got the website wrong.
[00:38:47.903 --> 00:38:50.944]  It's, uh, powercastco, powercastco.com.
[00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:54.743]  I actually ended up finding it because I googled it.
[00:38:55.703 --> 00:39:02.449]  They changed the front of the website, the webpage, the way it looks, before they had a soldier on there and it looked really creepy.
[00:39:03.209 --> 00:39:09.014]  They had stuff about RFID on there, on the front, but you can still find the stuff about the RFID if you look through it.
[00:39:09.034 --> 00:39:12.176]  Well, every website saying they've got something doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
[00:39:12.537 --> 00:39:14.598]  I don't know the sites, so I can't say one way or the other.
[00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:16.900]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.983]  Oh yeah, and I wanted to ask you also, have you heard of
[00:39:21.316 --> 00:39:23.497]  It's a project called R.O.D.S.
[00:39:23.777 --> 00:39:24.397]  from God.
[00:39:25.438 --> 00:39:27.218]  It's a space based weapon.
[00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:30.219]  R.O.D.S.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.960]  from God?
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.401]  Yeah, it's a space based weapon.
[00:39:33.541 --> 00:39:36.762]  That's just the code name for it.
[00:39:36.782 --> 00:39:38.763]  You can Google it.
[00:39:38.783 --> 00:39:39.883]  There's a little information on that.
[00:39:39.923 --> 00:39:41.304]  I would recommend people look that up.
[00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:49.045]  I bet they already have it up there, because if they're willing to let any information out on it, you know how it works.
[00:39:50.526 --> 00:39:52.667]  Well, I know what the real weapon systems are.
[00:39:52.687 --> 00:39:56.389]  I mean, I've talked... Go ahead and tell us, what's the system?
[00:39:56.469 --> 00:40:02.053]  It releases 20 foot steel and tungsten coated
[00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:13.256]  No, no, I'm aware of those, and yes, that's real.
[00:40:13.276 --> 00:40:21.300]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.842]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:40:26.022 --> 00:40:30.524]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:40:30.684 --> 00:40:32.085]  It's a documented fact.
[00:40:32.965 --> 00:40:39.589]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:40:39.729 --> 00:40:51.576]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:55.498]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:40:56.098 --> 00:40:58.499]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:02.761]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:06.423]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:06.843]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:41:06.863 --> 00:41:08.744]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:41:16.883 --> 00:41:18.985]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:41:19.506 --> 00:41:26.492]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:41:27.093 --> 00:41:33.239]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:35.500]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.062]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:41:38.142 --> 00:41:49.089]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.010]  It's not about left or right.
[00:41:51.391 --> 00:41:52.792]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:41:53.252 --> 00:41:59.476]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:42:00.146 --> 00:42:07.943]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:08.424 --> 00:42:09.566]  The Obama Deception.
[00:42:10.007 --> 00:42:11.189]  The people strike back!
[00:42:13.724 --> 00:42:19.206]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:42:19.226 --> 00:42:19.746]  and the world.
[00:42:20.026 --> 00:42:23.467]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:42:23.887 --> 00:42:30.129]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:42:30.389 --> 00:42:32.169]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:42:32.409 --> 00:42:37.631]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[00:42:37.831 --> 00:42:38.451]  We're good to go.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.401]  Strange days have found us.
[00:43:07.421 --> 00:43:08.401]  Strange days have trod us.
[00:43:43.524 --> 00:43:45.386]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors.
[00:43:45.406 --> 00:43:47.608]  We've got Jason Burmas with a bunch of breaking news.
[00:43:47.648 --> 00:43:48.729]  He'll be in here for 20 minutes.
[00:43:48.749 --> 00:43:50.631]  Then I've got Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:53.894]  Rescheduled from last week on what is.
[00:43:53.914 --> 00:43:58.839]  I had to reschedule him so that I could go on international television on Free Speech TV.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.661]  Press TV, excuse me.
[00:44:01.441 --> 00:44:02.142]  So that's coming up.
[00:44:02.262 --> 00:44:04.544]  And I promise we're going to get to everybody that's patiently holding.
[00:44:04.564 --> 00:44:07.868]  I want to tell you about a few of our sponsors first, then we'll go back to your calls.
[00:44:08.388 --> 00:44:14.696]  Home gain, let me tell you a little bit about the great folks at H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:44:15.097 --> 00:44:20.023]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, and getting any real estate questions answered.
[00:44:20.043 --> 00:44:24.749]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you'll get an instant free estimate on your home's value online.
[00:44:25.009 --> 00:44:27.132]  It's a great way to be able to monitor the value of your home.
[00:44:27.312 --> 00:44:28.392]  Again, it's absolutely free.
[00:44:28.692 --> 00:44:29.813]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[00:44:29.853 --> 00:44:33.374]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to HomeGain.com.
[00:44:33.694 --> 00:44:39.855]  They have a free home sale maximizer that tells you the best improvements to make on your home for the best resale value.
[00:44:40.196 --> 00:44:42.656]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[00:44:43.016 --> 00:44:50.558]  Visit their link, Max Little Orange Gorilla, on Infowars.com or visit them online at HomeGain.com.
[00:44:55.512 --> 00:45:03.421]  And one more fine sponsor I wanted to tell listeners about is Acola Blue, the best atmospheric water generator out there, bar none.
[00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:07.646]  Their website is E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E-D-O-T-C-O-M.
[00:45:07.726 --> 00:45:12.692]  Acolablue.com are big links up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if you miss them.
[00:45:13.292 --> 00:45:14.834]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.
[00:45:14.874 --> 00:45:15.775]  Pays for itself in one year.
[00:45:15.795 --> 00:45:16.776]  We buy our water from the store.
[00:45:17.116 --> 00:45:19.018]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[00:45:19.618 --> 00:45:22.081]  Ultimate water from the humidity in the air.
[00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:22.701]  Unlimited.
[00:45:22.721 --> 00:45:24.563]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[00:45:24.743 --> 00:45:27.086]  Machine produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[00:45:27.106 --> 00:45:30.329]  The generated water is passed through seven different filters.
[00:45:30.669 --> 00:45:32.251]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:33.232]  Neutral pH.
[00:45:33.732 --> 00:45:36.134]  Your own source of clean drinking water from the atmosphere.
[00:45:36.935 --> 00:45:38.796]  Colorblue.com or 1-800-691-6043.
[00:45:38.816 --> 00:45:39.036]  1-800-691-6043.
[00:45:39.156 --> 00:45:54.662]  And they've got a lot of callers there, but Gary Franchi, who does Restore the Republic and helps set up the In the Fed meetings and all the rest of it, is calling in on the show.
[00:45:54.962 --> 00:45:56.343]  So we'll pop in and say hi to him.
[00:45:56.643 --> 00:45:58.043]  Gary Franchi, what's going on, buddy?
[00:45:58.864 --> 00:45:59.824]  Alex, what's up, man?
[00:45:59.844 --> 00:46:01.144]  Just wanted to call in and say hello.
[00:46:01.205 --> 00:46:02.605]  Say I saw Obama Deception.
[00:46:03.365 --> 00:46:04.426]  Just another fine work.
[00:46:05.475 --> 00:46:09.156]  People need to get out there, push that movie into the people's hands.
[00:46:09.216 --> 00:46:16.678]  I saw, when I was out at the Tea Party in Chicago, there were just thousands of copies being distributed by the We Are Change crew there.
[00:46:17.358 --> 00:46:20.319]  Just amazing, amazing things that are going on in this country today.
[00:46:20.619 --> 00:46:23.640]  Are you heading out to the NFL rally this weekend?
[00:46:24.946 --> 00:46:26.127]  You know, we need to be promoting it.
[00:46:26.167 --> 00:46:30.631]  I've been promoting it for weeks and then this week's speeding past us and I've forgotten.
[00:46:30.691 --> 00:46:38.237]  I know they're having them at 38 locations and I know there's going to be one in Dallas at the Fed, one in Houston, one in San Antonio.
[00:46:38.777 --> 00:46:40.379]  I guess we should be going to that.
[00:46:40.939 --> 00:46:42.200]  I wonder which one we should go to.
[00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:44.822]  Well, just pick the closest one.
[00:46:44.842 --> 00:46:46.844]  We need to get all hands on deck for this.
[00:46:47.064 --> 00:46:48.606]  I spoke with Peter Shipp earlier today.
[00:46:48.626 --> 00:46:50.347]  He's going to be out in New York supporting it.
[00:46:51.668 --> 00:46:53.770]  You know, it's just so important to see
[00:46:54.907 --> 00:46:56.650]  The grassroots swell up.
[00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.292]  You know, we've got to shut this thing down.
[00:46:58.332 --> 00:46:59.974]  You know, the Federal Reserve is killing the country.
[00:46:59.994 --> 00:47:03.579]  Well, Gary, I should have gotten you on when it came out the Army was spying on all of us.
[00:47:04.099 --> 00:47:08.005]  Boy, that's really freedom, isn't it, to have the Army violating federal law spying on us?
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.121]  Well, it doesn't surprise me anymore.
[00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:16.345]  I don't know if I ever told you this, but I was invited to the National Reconnaissance Office.
[00:47:16.865 --> 00:47:18.986]  They gave me national security clearance.
[00:47:19.046 --> 00:47:23.509]  My wife and I walked in the doors, and I walked the halls.
[00:47:23.629 --> 00:47:24.870]  I saw the old satellites.
[00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.912]  I saw the old SR-71 Blackbirds.
[00:47:28.152 --> 00:47:32.214]  I sat down and ate chicken fingers and Domino's pizza at a retirement luncheon.
[00:47:32.234 --> 00:47:33.975]  I don't know why they let me in there.
[00:47:35.576 --> 00:47:40.000]  The NRO is one of the big birds that watches everything, you know?
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.121]  And they told me this.
[00:47:41.541 --> 00:47:43.162]  I know this.
[00:47:43.563 --> 00:47:46.345]  Nothing surprises me anymore, but we have to step up to the plate.
[00:47:46.465 --> 00:47:48.907]  Everybody listening to this show... I'll tell you what, Gary.
[00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:50.688]  Let me set you up in the next few days.
[00:47:50.708 --> 00:47:52.309]  If you can do it, we'll talk more about it, okay?
[00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:52.770]  Thanks.
[00:47:54.951 --> 00:47:58.334]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:47:58.354 --> 00:48:00.156]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:48:03.424 --> 00:48:05.004]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:48:05.104 --> 00:48:09.706]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:48:09.846 --> 00:48:12.606]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:48:12.827 --> 00:48:15.667]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:48:15.847 --> 00:48:21.709]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:24.892]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:48:25.172 --> 00:48:32.078]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:48:32.158 --> 00:48:35.281]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:35.642]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:48:35.702 --> 00:48:37.343]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:48:40.586 --> 00:48:46.670]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.592]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:48:50.612 --> 00:48:52.113]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:48:52.153 --> 00:48:52.573]  Take action today.
[00:48:52.594 --> 00:48:54.415]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:49:06.118 --> 00:49:08.019]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:49:08.499 --> 00:49:11.420]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:49:23.285 --> 00:49:24.966]  Alright folks, we are live.
[00:49:25.046 --> 00:49:34.370]  I'm Jason Burmess sitting in for just a couple of segments for Alex Jones and we're going to do a Burmess News Blitz here in the next 15 or so minutes.
[00:49:36.584 --> 00:49:47.973]  I really want to cover Australia and UK news because both of these countries are going to be participating in this NLE09 exercise and this is really a nexus point.
[00:49:48.613 --> 00:49:48.854]  Alright?
[00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:56.439]  We know that Obama wants a civilian national security force as large as the actual army, as well funded, as well manned.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.720]  Well now, Paul Rudd
[00:49:58.681 --> 00:50:01.302]  Who is the Prime Minister over in Australia and wants the same thing.
[00:50:01.762 --> 00:50:09.585]  A civilian corps manned by everyday Australians to help out in war zones and natural disasters is set to be announced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in Perth on Wednesday.
[00:50:09.785 --> 00:50:19.089]  Now they already have these brute force squads and I'm going to be playing videos of those tonight on my program on the Info Warrior from 9 to midnight.
[00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:28.442]  And I've got to probably vet it for language because international TV is always a little bit different but basically they have these cops in black uniforms and they just patrol the streets as the tough guys.
[00:50:28.682 --> 00:50:29.884]  They're in the tough zones.
[00:50:30.304 --> 00:50:35.992]  So they're militarizing the police and then they're saying no we need the civilian corps as well so they're creating another
[00:50:37.313 --> 00:50:42.619]  Military-like force outside of the police force, which they're already militarizing.
[00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:50.987]  And remember, Australia is going to be big in this NLE09 exercise, where a terrorist attack happens somewhere outside of the United States.
[00:50:51.628 --> 00:50:58.215]  We would assume it will be either in the UK, Mexico, Canada, or Australia, because those are the countries that are participating.
[00:50:59.269 --> 00:51:07.733]  But what else is really interesting is that both the UK, leaders within the UK, and Australia are also calling for massive population reductions.
[00:51:08.554 --> 00:51:08.834]  Alright?
[00:51:09.694 --> 00:51:15.077]  We covered this one right here a few weeks ago on the Alex Jones Show and on my program.
[00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:17.939]  UK population must fall to 30 million says Porritt.
[00:51:20.436 --> 00:51:24.137]  And Jonathan Port is one of Gordon Brown's leading green advisors.
[00:51:24.277 --> 00:51:28.538]  Remember, Gordon Brown, member of the World Sustainability Society.
[00:51:29.538 --> 00:51:32.019]  The word sustainability means you have to die.
[00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:32.859]  That's what it means.
[00:51:32.899 --> 00:51:33.959]  You have to be controlled.
[00:51:34.099 --> 00:51:35.640]  You have to have a one-child policy.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.860]  You have to be sterilized.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.181]  That's what sustainability means when these people talk about it.
[00:51:39.601 --> 00:51:43.362]  How else are they going to take a population of 70 million people
[00:51:44.102 --> 00:51:48.888]  Which is what the UK has, and bring it down to 30 million by I think 2020.
[00:51:49.168 --> 00:51:52.051]  No, I'm sorry, 2031.
[00:51:53.012 --> 00:51:53.994]  I mean, unbelievable!
[00:51:54.915 --> 00:52:00.081]  But other people within this world sustainable society here are calling for the same thing.
[00:52:01.505 --> 00:52:07.049]  In Australia, Australia should consider having a one-child policy to protect the planet.
[00:52:07.449 --> 00:52:18.836]  An environmental lobby group says Sustainable Population Australia, remember it's all about sustainability, says slashing the world's population is the only way to avoid environmental suicide.
[00:52:19.656 --> 00:52:22.318]  See, some of you are going to have to die, or we're all going to die.
[00:52:22.718 --> 00:52:23.699]  We're going to kill the planet.
[00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:25.000]  That's the propaganda, folks.
[00:52:25.891 --> 00:52:33.885]  And National President Sandra Kank wants Australia's population of almost 22 million reduced to 7 million to tackle climate change.
[00:52:34.706 --> 00:52:37.471]  Folks, that's a 67% reduction.
[00:52:37.811 --> 00:52:38.613]  That's 2 out of 3 of you.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:40.800]  Done.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.521]  Do you get it?
[00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:46.041]  Sustainability means killing people.
[00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:47.202]  That's what it means.
[00:52:47.262 --> 00:52:48.182]  It means killing people.
[00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:51.963]  Ted Turner gets on there and he's like, global warming is because there's too many people.
[00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:53.703]  And it keeps going like this.
[00:52:53.723 --> 00:52:57.624]  They're going to all die and then the ones that are left over are going to be in a cannibal society.
[00:52:58.064 --> 00:53:00.985]  And the bottom line is we need a sustainable population.
[00:53:01.185 --> 00:53:02.666]  There's too many people, Charlie Rose.
[00:53:02.986 --> 00:53:03.346]  Too many.
[00:53:05.956 --> 00:53:14.009]  It's propaganda on another level, folks, where they're trying to make you guilty for eating, breathing, being a human being, driving an SUV.
[00:53:15.242 --> 00:53:18.863]  In Europe, they're pumping the propaganda that Americans use too much toilet paper.
[00:53:19.023 --> 00:53:27.265]  Our two-ply is worse than SUVs that gas guzzle and emit evil carbon dioxide, even though we ran this story last night on the Infowarrior.
[00:53:27.605 --> 00:53:36.547]  Singapore researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotech have devised a way to convert carbon dioxide into clean-burning biofuel methanol using a safe, non-toxic process.
[00:53:36.807 --> 00:53:39.448]  Has mankind defeated the final boss of global warming?
[00:53:39.688 --> 00:53:40.568]  If this is true,
[00:53:41.448 --> 00:53:42.309]  It will go nowhere.
[00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:47.492]  Because they still... Folks, they're saying that too many trees are causing global warming now.
[00:53:47.592 --> 00:53:55.517]  It's all about a taxation, a carbon emissions control grid, where they can go after corporations that aren't part of the ballgame.
[00:53:56.138 --> 00:53:57.519]  People that aren't going along with the program.
[00:53:57.539 --> 00:53:59.380]  And then they can tax the populace on top of it.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.281]  The Alex Jones Show will be back after this.
[00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.403]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:16.092]  You are a rebel, admit it.
[00:54:16.452 --> 00:54:19.195]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[00:54:19.415 --> 00:54:21.477]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[00:54:21.817 --> 00:54:25.500]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.382]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[00:54:31.698 --> 00:54:31.838]  I think?
[00:55:05.174 --> 00:55:19.283]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:55:19.803 --> 00:55:26.808]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:55:27.367 --> 00:55:33.552]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:55:33.972 --> 00:55:35.794]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:55:35.934 --> 00:55:38.356]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:55:38.436 --> 00:55:49.385]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:55:50.005 --> 00:55:51.306]  It's not about left or right.
[00:55:51.687 --> 00:55:53.028]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:55:53.524 --> 00:55:59.871]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:56:00.431 --> 00:56:08.219]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.861]  The Obama Deception.
[00:56:10.281 --> 00:56:11.483]  The people strike back.
[00:56:13.214 --> 00:56:14.715]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:56:14.895 --> 00:56:16.357]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:56:16.657 --> 00:56:18.879]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:56:19.339 --> 00:56:24.083]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:56:24.463 --> 00:56:27.326]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:56:27.666 --> 00:56:31.149]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[00:57:14.804 --> 00:57:20.807]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:57:21.408 --> 00:57:24.449]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:27.351]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:30.692]  It's the Alex Jones Show, and I'm sitting in for Alex for a couple of segments.
[00:57:30.752 --> 00:57:31.513]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:33.754]  I got a little show called The Info Warrior 9 to Midnight.
[00:57:33.774 --> 00:57:36.976]  It airs at Infowars.com and GCNlive.com.
[00:57:37.236 --> 00:57:39.097]  I just want to recap what we just covered.
[00:57:40.208 --> 00:57:59.335]  Now, both Australia and the United Kingdom are going to be participating in this NLE, National Level Exercise 09, the first of its kind, headed up by FEMA, where they're going to be making makeshift FEMA camps, bringing in private organizations, doing live-time spying on the American populace with every tool they have.
[00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:11.839]  Okay this is a federal, local, private, tribal even drill where they are literally going to go after every piece of infrastructure they can.
[00:58:12.099 --> 00:58:18.804]  FEMA region 6, Washington DC, Texas is going to be involved, New Mexico, and a few other states.
[00:58:19.044 --> 00:58:22.227]  Now remember they're also going to use international organizations.
[00:58:23.306 --> 00:58:25.288]  And the terrorist attack is going to happen overseas.
[00:58:25.328 --> 00:58:29.131]  Now, there may be terrorist attacks that happen during this drill in this country.
[00:58:29.251 --> 00:58:30.412]  They say that it's open.
[00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:32.194]  There is no determined result.
[00:58:32.995 --> 00:58:37.158]  So, I really doubt that they're going to use this as an opportunity to pull off a false flag.
[00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:46.586]  However, it is to train people so that when they do put another drill into place, or another drill comes up two or three months down the line, that then
[00:58:47.347 --> 00:58:48.388]  One that's less publicized.
[00:58:48.488 --> 00:58:50.929]  Then, they will pull off their false flag attack.
[00:58:51.389 --> 00:58:52.229]  Just like on 9-11.
[00:58:52.670 --> 00:59:03.555]  See, they have a Malcolm Virgo run in June of 2001, where they hijack a plane and they ram it into the Capitol building, and Bin Laden is on the cover of the document.
[00:59:04.522 --> 00:59:12.046]  And then the second part is FBI agents are going to live hijack a plane and then fly it to a secure location.
[00:59:12.086 --> 00:59:13.227]  Amalgam Virgo, check it out.
[00:59:13.447 --> 00:59:14.527]  And then 9-11 happens.
[00:59:14.547 --> 00:59:16.789]  And on the morning of 9-11, similar drills are happening.
[00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:18.489]  Some are majorly classified.
[00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:21.071]  The last one that came out literally came out six months ago.
[00:59:21.271 --> 00:59:23.312]  It's called Operation Jackal Cave.
[00:59:23.892 --> 00:59:26.894]  And two paragraphs are uncensored in a nine-page document.
[00:59:27.234 --> 00:59:31.877]  Gee, I wonder if that could have anything to do with Middle Eastern terrorists attacking America on 9-11.
[00:59:32.757 --> 00:59:33.077]  I wonder.
[00:59:33.097 --> 00:59:40.360]  I mean, you know, the National Reconnaissance Office is only running a drill at 846 in the morning with the CIA of ramming a plane into a building.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.882]  You know, there's only mass hijacking drills going on on 9-11.
[00:59:43.902 --> 00:59:45.362]  That's why we have to keep an eye on this.
[00:59:46.203 --> 00:59:55.987]  And remember, these private sector organizations are ones like AT&T that have been caught helping the government wiretap and spy on the American people at every turn, every corner.
[00:59:56.647 --> 01:00:01.613]  I mean, we can have the guy go on MSNBC, go on Olbermann and say, Yeah, I went in the secret room!
[01:00:01.834 --> 01:00:06.539]  I was hooking up the Ethernet wire to this computer that was making a hard copy of every communication AT&T has!
[01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:09.002]  And then they just say, you know what?
[01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:10.523]  National security, you can't sue.
[01:00:11.003 --> 01:00:12.424]  Civil suit, we're going to dismiss it.
[01:00:12.805 --> 01:00:13.185]  Go away.
[01:00:13.565 --> 01:00:17.348]  And then the Obama administration comes in, and they say, you know what?
[01:00:17.468 --> 01:00:20.551]  Maybe these Cheney-Bush powers, they need to be expanded.
[01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:21.631]  They don't need to be retracted.
[01:00:21.671 --> 01:00:26.175]  I know we promised that we were going to get rid of all this tyranny, but let's just up the stakes, folks.
[01:00:26.775 --> 01:00:29.758]  I mean, Patriot Act's one, two, parts of three, that wasn't enough.
[01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:33.661]  Military Commissions Act, ending habeas corpus in this country, not enough.
[01:00:34.568 --> 01:00:36.869]  Let's start ending posse commentatus on a mass level.
[01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:43.613]  Let's announce that the National Guard is just gonna, you know, help find the drugs and patrol the streets and help with car accidents.
[01:00:43.813 --> 01:00:54.560]  Then we'll build a National Service Corporation with the Give Act, and then we'll brainwash everybody just around September 11th when we do little knockin' talks and we say, come on, join the Civil Service Corps.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.980]  Look, we're helping people.
[01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:58.122]  We have memorials all around the country.
[01:00:58.462 --> 01:01:00.143]  It's National Service Day, huh?
[01:01:00.964 --> 01:01:03.107]  Let's feel together like we did after 9-11.
[01:01:03.147 --> 01:01:04.309]  Let's come together as one.
[01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:04.950]  We can do it.
[01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:06.532]  It's just disgusting.
[01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:15.204]  And meanwhile, people like myself and Alex Jones are constantly ridiculed and savagely attacked in the mainstream media.
[01:01:15.484 --> 01:01:19.387]  And now there's this Angels and Demons movie coming out, right?
[01:01:20.428 --> 01:01:34.718]  So Esquire is running this, you know, disgusting article where, of course, 9-11 truth is associated with Holocaust denial, and we hate the Jews again, and you know, birth of a nation, all this Johnny nonsense, when Esquire enables these people
[01:01:34.718 --> 01:01:35.278]  We're good to go.
[01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.552]  That's what they, they want you to associate us with Nazis.
[01:02:05.753 --> 01:02:10.337]  It's, I mean, this program has been going on since the inception of 9-11 Truth.
[01:02:12.158 --> 01:02:19.444]  And the whack jobs denying 9-11 and the Holocaust say a lot about Obama's hopes for a new era of responsibility.
[01:02:19.684 --> 01:02:25.569]  You see, it's all, it's all pro-Obama, anti-9-11 Truth.
[01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:30.793]  9-11 deniers, this is how it starts, 9-11 deniers, and of course, 9-11 deniers is linked to
[01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:32.788]  I sent you guys the link.
[01:02:32.808 --> 01:02:34.789]  Can we bring that up on PrisonPlanet.tv, by the way, guys?
[01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:46.471]  911 Deniers has the link to the Popular Mechanics article, and we know how credible Popular Mechanics has been with their thorough debunking of the FEMA camps, showing a satellite photo and a video from 1996 and saying, nope, not real!
[01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:50.132]  Yeah, there's 600 locations that we know about all over the country.
[01:02:50.172 --> 01:02:51.412]  We're going to go to the train station.
[01:02:52.053 --> 01:02:53.473]  We're going to show you Amtrak trains.
[01:02:54.513 --> 01:02:56.814]  Popular Mechanics, I mean, just stellar work.
[01:02:57.094 --> 01:02:57.454]  I love it.
[01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:06.408]  So they link to that, and then of course they have to put in the moon landing paranoias, and then the next one is the Cassandras of the New World Order.
[01:03:06.568 --> 01:03:12.210]  You know, the New World Order doesn't exist, they're just a headline at Time Magazine two weeks ago, Barack Obama's New World Order.
[01:03:12.671 --> 01:03:16.592]  In fact, there's three Time Magazine headlines with New World Order in the last six months.
[01:03:16.872 --> 01:03:18.653]  November, Obama's New World Order.
[01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:24.536]  Time Magazine, the New World Order, talking about the new global financial system that they openly created during the G20.
[01:03:25.942 --> 01:03:29.907]  And then, of course, Barack Obama's New World Order right after the G20.
[01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:30.808]  But it doesn't exist!
[01:03:31.188 --> 01:03:31.949]  We're crazy!
[01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:33.491]  You know, Esquire says so, Alex.
[01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:35.273]  Burmese, I'm down with Foreign TV.
[01:03:35.293 --> 01:03:36.254]  You are on fire today.
[01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:39.517]  Hey, you're going to be live tonight, but you're going to visit family in New York tomorrow.
[01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:39.998]  Yes, I am.
[01:03:40.018 --> 01:03:41.139]  We'll rebroadcast 9 to midnight.
[01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:41.860]  You'll be live tonight.
[01:03:43.627 --> 01:03:49.431]  She'll cover more of that, but yeah, I'll have them come out and now say, before it was, we want to tax you if you have more than one child.
[01:03:50.472 --> 01:03:53.534]  Now they're saying, oh, it's going to be a one-child policy.
[01:03:54.195 --> 01:03:57.017]  So, see, I told you that taxing to have kids is one child.
[01:03:57.578 --> 01:04:02.401]  That's how they first announced it in China in 75, and in 81 they made a law where you can't have them, period.
[01:04:03.002 --> 01:04:05.464]  It's more accelerated now, and they're pushing it.
[01:04:05.484 --> 01:04:06.284]  You know, having kids is bad.
[01:04:06.304 --> 01:04:08.026]  That's what we have in Endgame, is the news clips.
[01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:20.033]  So, Burmess, I am going to go ahead and go to this quick clip, about a minute or two long, of a reporter being arrested for being down the street videotaping cops at a wreck.
[01:04:20.093 --> 01:04:22.694]  And this is happening everywhere, where the police are attacking camera people.
[01:04:23.134 --> 01:04:28.097]  Our guys barely got back from Boston at a Tea Party meeting with their cameras.
[01:04:28.117 --> 01:04:28.898]  They were being interrogated.
[01:04:28.938 --> 01:04:29.958]  Why did they have cameras?
[01:04:30.339 --> 01:04:34.061]  It's now terrorism in England to videotape the police doing anything, and they're charging people.
[01:04:34.421 --> 01:04:35.562]  With it, including journalists.
[01:04:35.582 --> 01:04:36.162]  So that's coming up.
[01:04:36.202 --> 01:04:39.404]  And then Judge Napolitano is going to be on with this coming up in about two minutes.
[01:04:39.704 --> 01:04:40.264]  So stay with us.
[01:04:40.285 --> 01:04:40.765]  Thank you, Burmese.
[01:04:40.805 --> 01:04:41.205]  Thank you.
[01:04:41.585 --> 01:04:43.306]  Here's the clip, folks.
[01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:48.609]  Reporter Darren Hunt and photojournalist Rick Dupont were both handcuffed and detained by police.
[01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:55.633]  Darren and Rick came up on the crash minutes after it happened and stopped on the shoulder on the eastbound lanes opposite the wreck.
[01:04:55.994 --> 01:04:59.636]  They were conducting interviews when Sergeant Ramirez ordered them to leave.
[01:05:00.456 --> 01:05:01.697]  Watch for yourself what happened.
[01:05:02.501 --> 01:05:04.002]  You get in your truck and move.
[01:05:04.022 --> 01:05:05.842]  We're going to talk to this guy real quick.
[01:05:05.882 --> 01:05:08.863]  Negative sir, you are getting in your truck and move.
[01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:09.643]  We're doing our job.
[01:05:10.404 --> 01:05:11.444]  You press that trigger, bud.
[01:05:11.464 --> 01:05:12.965]  Get in your truck and move.
[01:05:12.985 --> 01:05:14.665]  You can shoot if he wants to.
[01:05:14.705 --> 01:05:17.126]  Get in your truck and move.
[01:05:17.206 --> 01:05:18.586]  You can shoot if he wants to.
[01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:19.747]  Do you want me to arrest you?
[01:05:19.767 --> 01:05:20.127]  No, I don't.
[01:05:20.147 --> 01:05:21.507]  Do you want me to arrest you?
[01:05:21.547 --> 01:05:24.108]  Then you get in your truck and you move.
[01:05:24.248 --> 01:05:25.109]  Hang on a second.
[01:05:25.209 --> 01:05:25.729]  I don't care.
[01:05:25.909 --> 01:05:27.309]  I'm telling you something.
[01:05:27.329 --> 01:05:28.750]  I'm giving you an order.
[01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:29.470]  You know what?
[01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.410]  I didn't do anything.
[01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:31.691]  Do you want to get arrested?
[01:05:31.711 --> 01:05:31.891]  Okay.
[01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:33.553]  Uh, just, we'll go.
[01:05:33.573 --> 01:05:34.333]  I'll go.
[01:05:34.513 --> 01:05:35.173]  It's fine, I'll go.
[01:05:35.233 --> 01:05:35.954]  I'm not resisting.
[01:05:36.134 --> 01:05:36.854]  I'm not resisting.
[01:05:36.874 --> 01:05:41.937]  I think I can get in the truck and pick him up.
[01:05:42.017 --> 01:05:43.738]  Go get in the truck before you go too!
[01:05:43.758 --> 01:05:44.778]  Can you let him go?
[01:05:44.898 --> 01:05:46.559]  Get out of the truck!
[01:05:46.619 --> 01:05:48.360]  I didn't do anything!
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.001]  Get your hands off the truck!
[01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:51.702]  Look, I'm not doing anything!
[01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:54.129]  I'm not doing anything!
[01:05:54.149 --> 01:05:55.289]  Cop roughing him up.
[01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:58.471]  Now notice, once he submitted, the cop got even more excited.
[01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:00.372]  The tyranny was flowing.
[01:06:01.172 --> 01:06:05.414]  And he got even more excited and aroused over that.
[01:06:06.094 --> 01:06:10.116]  And somebody who I really like because he exposes how it's not a left-right paradigm.
[01:06:10.156 --> 01:06:11.817]  He exposes the Patriot Act or Bush.
[01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:14.238]  He talks about how Obama lied and is expanding it.
[01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:18.000]  He talks about really what this country is facing.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.082]  And so we are really honored to have
[01:06:22.202 --> 01:06:41.514]  Andrew Napolitano, judge, also Fox News Channel commentator, best-selling author, Princeton University, where he was a founding member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton and Notre Dame Law School, and Napolitano sat on the New Jersey bench from 87 to 95, becoming the state's
[01:06:42.495 --> 01:06:44.555]  Youngest life-tenured judge.
[01:06:44.595 --> 01:06:49.297]  He also served as an adjunct professor at Sinton Hall University School of Law for 11 years.
[01:06:49.957 --> 01:06:55.818]  And I think he's the best guy on the radio of what I would call mainline radio exposing things.
[01:06:55.838 --> 01:06:59.999]  We're about to break in a minute, Judge, but I tell you, tyranny is just going crazy, isn't it?
[01:07:00.479 --> 01:07:01.299]  It is, Alex.
[01:07:01.739 --> 01:07:09.081]  I just had that Pastor Steven Anderson on my FreedomWatchFoxNews.com internet show, and we
[01:07:09.744 --> 01:07:25.312]  We saw the tape of the, uh, they're not even border patrol, they're border agents that were 75 miles from the Mexico-Arizona border, deep into Arizona, uh, taser him, stomp on his face, press it into, uh, cracked glass and, uh, asphalt.
[01:07:25.874 --> 01:07:28.476]  Because he would not give them permission to search his trunk.
[01:07:28.556 --> 01:07:29.637]  Then they made fun of him!
[01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:30.558]  Then they made fun of him!
[01:07:30.858 --> 01:07:33.881]  Yes, they mocked him and said, you must be a terrorist.
[01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:38.645]  And they told him that the Constitution didn't apply to them and where he happened to be.
[01:07:38.665 --> 01:07:40.687]  There's a little good news in that today.
[01:07:40.747 --> 01:07:50.636]  Coming from the Supreme Court, an unusual combination of liberals and conservatives issued an opinion last night saying the police can't search your trunk anymore.
[01:07:51.158 --> 01:07:53.699]  They either have to get your permission or they have to get a search warrant.
[01:07:53.719 --> 01:08:03.763]  The old rule that they could search anything they want in the car merely because they stopped you for going two miles over the limit or not having a seatbelt on is now history.
[01:08:04.303 --> 01:08:09.045]  So that should put a little bit of a crimp in the armor of the jackbooted thugs.
[01:08:09.105 --> 01:08:10.265]  Not enough, but a little bit.
[01:08:10.345 --> 01:08:14.967]  A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single pace, but there's a lot of potholes still to come.
[01:08:16.084 --> 01:08:16.825]  Absolutely.
[01:08:18.087 --> 01:08:19.929]  When we come back, Judge, we've got until 45 after.
[01:08:19.949 --> 01:08:20.530]  We appreciate your time.
[01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:21.151]  We know you're busy.
[01:08:21.451 --> 01:08:26.357]  I want to get into Obama, because I was driving to work the other morning and listening to you on XM.
[01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:27.859]  I listened many days.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.043]  It's just one of the few shows I really, you know, actually learned something from.
[01:08:32.825 --> 01:08:41.695]  You were talking about the fact that the whole Nuremberg system of, that I don't care if Hitler tells you to kill little kids, just following orders doesn't cut it.
[01:08:42.015 --> 01:08:46.420]  Obama is saying, no, we're going to protect people that break the law when they're ordered to do it.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.061]  This is just unprecedented.
[01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:53.007]  I want to go through that and your take on where Barack Obama is taking us now, announcing the youth brigades.
[01:08:53.487 --> 01:08:58.073]  Now announcing the new green carbon taxes to be selectively enforced on everybody.
[01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.396]  He's Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:09:00.416 --> 01:09:02.398]  We'll give you his website and a lot more.
[01:09:02.418 --> 01:09:04.361]  His radio show is Brian and the Judge.
[01:09:04.861 --> 01:09:08.826]  Heard weekday mornings on XM and M&M stations across the country.
[01:09:09.207 --> 01:09:09.928]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:10.248]  Stay with us.
[01:09:10.268 --> 01:09:11.410]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:18.637]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:09:18.917 --> 01:09:27.204]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:09:27.484 --> 01:09:30.787]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:09:31.047 --> 01:09:34.009]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[01:09:34.289 --> 01:09:36.411]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[01:09:36.791 --> 01:09:39.493]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.
[01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:42.516]  Visit 2bnatural.com and order today!
[01:09:42.816 --> 01:09:43.397]  We're good to go.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:12.960]  Catalog!
[01:10:13.361 --> 01:10:15.002]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:10:15.283 --> 01:10:15.463]  April 22, 2009.
[01:10:15.523 --> 01:10:16.764]  Gold opened this morning at $889.90.
[01:10:16.804 --> 01:10:20.087]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $915.86, $457.93 for the half ounce, and $228.96 for a quarter ounce.
[01:10:20.147 --> 01:10:20.608]  That's $915.86, $457.93, and $228.96.
[01:10:32.657 --> 01:10:46.472]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes and servicing debt?
[01:10:46.692 --> 01:10:47.673]  Is this capitalism?
[01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:55.281]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:56.481]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:10:56.601 --> 01:11:00.803]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:02.043]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:11:02.103 --> 01:11:03.063]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:03.223]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:11:03.243 --> 01:11:03.463]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:11:03.483 --> 01:11:06.584]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:11:20.129 --> 01:11:25.472]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:11:25.992 --> 01:11:32.196]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:11:32.516 --> 01:11:34.317]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:11:34.477 --> 01:11:36.858]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:11:36.938 --> 01:11:47.824]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:11:50.114 --> 01:11:51.375]  It's not about left or right.
[01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.177]  It's about a one world government.
[01:11:53.637 --> 01:11:59.982]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:12:00.563 --> 01:12:08.329]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:08.809 --> 01:12:09.970]  The Obama Deception.
[01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:11.572]  The people strike back.
[01:12:13.444 --> 01:12:23.534]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:12:24.014 --> 01:12:25.055]  Garden in a Can!
[01:12:25.436 --> 01:12:28.999]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.341]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[01:12:31.602 --> 01:12:33.884]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:12:34.344 --> 01:12:43.414]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:12:44.034 --> 01:12:45.035]  Garden in a can.
[01:12:45.456 --> 01:12:46.317]  It's that simple.
[01:12:46.657 --> 01:12:46.957]  Fresh.
[01:12:47.358 --> 01:12:47.738]  Healthy.
[01:12:48.219 --> 01:12:48.519]  Easy.
[01:12:49.059 --> 01:12:53.004]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:12:53.404 --> 01:12:54.285]  Ready when you are.
[01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:58.583]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.

[01:13:04.105 --> 01:13:04.145]  866-598-7396.
[01:13:04.165 --> 01:13:05.745]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, yeah when I watch his Fox
[01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:26.971]  Well, you know, the President is in a little bit of a bind.
[01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:29.713]  I really don't agree with him on any of his
[01:13:54.693 --> 01:14:10.739]  Publicly stated positions, except in part this one, which is to review and reveal, so that we can review, the advice that was given to the Bush administration, basically telling it that CIA agents could do whatever they wanted.
[01:14:10.799 --> 01:14:18.122]  I profoundly disagreed with him when he originally said, both personally and through his Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel,
[01:14:18.672 --> 01:14:22.093]  That nobody will be prosecuted, and he seems to have backed off on that.
[01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:24.653]  But, you know, there are prosecutions and there are prosecutions.
[01:14:25.254 --> 01:14:41.838]  When the American military treated Iraqi prisoners like dogs, literally, by putting dog collars on them and keeping them naked in flesh piles and inducing unnatural and immoral sexual acts, they prosecuted a private and a sergeant.
[01:14:41.898 --> 01:14:47.379]  They never prosecuted anybody up the chain of command, however far it went, and there's evidence that
[01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:52.901]  Secretary Rumsfeld himself was aware of that and either looked the other way, condoned it or authorized it.
[01:14:53.381 --> 01:14:55.722]  The same must be the case for these torture memos.
[01:14:55.762 --> 01:14:57.363]  Now, I'll give you a little bit of information.
[01:14:57.583 --> 01:15:02.665]  One is that the torture memos are exceptionally one-sided.
[01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:06.667]  That is, when a client says to a lawyer, may I do this?
[01:15:06.787 --> 01:15:10.889]  It's the lawyer's job to amass the law in favor of the this.
[01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:15.559]  And against the this, and then give a conclusion.
[01:15:16.619 --> 01:15:17.880]  These memos don't do that.
[01:15:18.441 --> 01:15:23.784]  They compliment the CIA for having the patience to wait and ask.
[01:15:23.844 --> 01:15:27.367]  We now know they didn't wait, they started this stuff before they even got the memo.
[01:15:28.047 --> 01:15:36.072]  And it then gives all sorts of twisted, tortured interpretations of words in order to justify what the CIA wanted to do.
[01:15:36.152 --> 01:15:36.633]  Two points.
[01:15:36.853 --> 01:15:36.953]  One,
[01:15:37.751 --> 01:15:59.624]  The author, the principal author of these memos, now a federal judge, he never would have been confirmed if the memos had been released before his confirmation, that's another story, opines in these memos that he cannot say for sure if the medieval torture devices of the thumbscrew and the rack constitute torture.
[01:16:00.606 --> 01:16:11.492]  So they obviously picked someone to write these memos with an extremely, uh, perverse threshold as to what is torture and what isn't.
[01:16:12.252 --> 01:16:27.621]  Two, Bob Bair, a former CIA agent with whom I have clashed many times over the Constitution, came onto my radio show, Brian and the Judge, this morning and startled my partner, who favors all this torture, and I, who of course
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.521]  Oppose it with every fiber of my being by saying the following.
[01:16:32.181 --> 01:16:39.924]  The CIA exaggerated the extent of the danger that was posed by these people un-interrogated.
[01:16:40.364 --> 01:16:46.826]  It exaggerated the nature of what it expected they knew, and it exaggerated what it received from them.
[01:16:47.246 --> 01:16:49.426]  Question from my partner, Brian Kilmeade.
[01:16:49.767 --> 01:16:53.908]  What about the second wave, and what about the third wave of attacks that never came?
[01:16:54.728 --> 01:16:58.711]  Because of the information obtained by these enhanced interrogation techniques.
[01:16:58.951 --> 01:17:01.913]  Answer, the CIA exaggerated that as well.
[01:17:02.234 --> 01:17:06.897]  There never has been any evidence of the planning of a second or a third wave.
[01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:12.061]  So, when you put all this together, you really have a horrific
[01:17:12.401 --> 01:17:13.422]  A series of events.
[01:17:13.502 --> 01:17:16.845]  A lawyer telling his boss he can do whatever he wants.
[01:17:17.305 --> 01:17:24.391]  The CIA carefully manipulating the Justice Department and the White House into giving it the authority that it wants to do.
[01:17:24.411 --> 01:17:30.635]  A compliant president, whom Karl Rove told me on my show, read the memos.
[01:17:30.716 --> 01:17:31.876]  I said, how do you know he read them?
[01:17:31.896 --> 01:17:36.480]  He said, well, we read them together, meaning they were probably read out loud to each other.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.702]  You can speculate on the reasons for that.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.141]  We have a very, very sad state of affairs.
[01:17:42.961 --> 01:17:52.985]  If no one is prosecuted, then we really have a rejuvenation of the Nuremberg defense, which is, I thought it was legal and I was told to do it by my bosses.
[01:17:53.505 --> 01:18:04.909]  That defense has been rejected by every signatory to the Geneva Conventions, which is virtually every country on the planet except for China, Israel, and Iran.
[01:18:08.098 --> 01:18:12.102]  Israel didn't exist at the time, and I don't believe it subsequently, and I might be wrong on that.
[01:18:12.883 --> 01:18:18.709]  Every country in the world agrees that the Nuremberg Defense is no longer valid.
[01:18:21.973 --> 01:18:24.475]  It's amazing to have this going on, and
[01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:33.575]  They also did things like grab people and get them to give confessions to bombing buildings that didn't exist when they were arrested.
[01:18:34.536 --> 01:18:38.339]  So we also know it was used for fake confessions, Judge.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:43.443]  And, you know, Obama claims he's backing off this now.
[01:18:43.643 --> 01:18:45.085]  We need to see prosecution.
[01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:46.646]  Or where does it go from there?
[01:18:46.666 --> 01:18:49.388]  I mean, once you start torturing people, where does it end?
[01:18:49.428 --> 01:18:54.773]  And now when our troops get captured, how do we say it's not okay for other countries to torture them?
[01:18:55.905 --> 01:18:59.127]  It's like this Iranian American being grabbed by the Iranians.
[01:18:59.147 --> 01:19:00.428]  They're saying she had a kangaroo court.
[01:19:00.888 --> 01:19:03.710]  Well, how do we say it's a kangaroo court when the Military Commissions does that?
[01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:04.610]  We're on the march.
[01:19:05.111 --> 01:19:06.712]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:19:07.652 --> 01:19:10.334]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.261]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:19:17.381 --> 01:19:22.602]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:19:22.782 --> 01:19:27.563]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:19:27.943 --> 01:19:39.066]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:19:39.466 --> 01:19:45.008]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:19:45.228 --> 01:19:51.310]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:52.131]  What about you?
[01:19:52.531 --> 01:19:58.573]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[01:20:13.697 --> 01:20:19.018]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:19.518 --> 01:20:26.520]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:20:27.094 --> 01:20:33.277]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:20:33.678 --> 01:20:35.519]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:20:35.659 --> 01:20:38.060]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:49.126]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:20:49.725 --> 01:20:51.006]  It's not about left or right.
[01:20:51.386 --> 01:20:52.807]  It's about a one world government.
[01:20:53.247 --> 01:20:59.590]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:08.434 --> 01:21:09.575]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:09.995 --> 01:21:11.196]  The people strike back.
[01:21:13.194 --> 01:21:14.455]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:14.515 --> 01:21:19.860]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:24.724]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:21:25.124 --> 01:21:30.188]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:21:30.689 --> 01:21:35.393]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:21:35.913 --> 01:21:37.795]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:42.831]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:43.912]  And here's the best part.
[01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:46.914]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:21:47.214 --> 01:21:50.517]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:21:50.837 --> 01:21:53.679]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:21:54.019 --> 01:21:55.900]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:21:56.241 --> 01:21:57.161]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:21:57.181 --> 01:21:57.361]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:21:57.381 --> 01:21:58.502]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:09.541]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:22:09.862 --> 01:22:12.302]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:32.466]  Coming up, we got a news clip where mainstream media admits and one of the former economists at the World Bank says that it's a private oligarchy ruling the United States.
[01:22:33.546 --> 01:22:36.287]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, best-selling author, Fox News contributor,
[01:22:38.254 --> 01:22:41.798]  And Seneca Radio host is our guest for another 10 minutes and we've got to let him go.
[01:22:41.818 --> 01:22:43.741]  I always enjoy being on his show as well.
[01:22:43.781 --> 01:22:44.682]  We appreciate him being here.
[01:22:45.463 --> 01:22:53.532]  Mr. Napolitano, Judge, specifically, the establishment tries to put us in left-right camps for Divide and Conquer.
[01:22:53.572 --> 01:22:53.913]  You know that.
[01:22:53.933 --> 01:22:54.694]  I heard you talk about it.
[01:22:54.734 --> 01:22:56.035]  I heard really no one else talking about it.
[01:22:57.317 --> 01:23:04.045]  And to have MSNBC, CNN come out on every show and say, you go to a tea party, you're racist.
[01:23:04.486 --> 01:23:09.832]  It's not that people are concerned about bankrupting the country or the police state or the $12.8 trillion spent so far.
[01:23:11.754 --> 01:23:13.555]  98% of Americans in polls against the bailouts.
[01:23:14.415 --> 01:23:18.077]  I mean, that is cold-blooded for the system to come out and say, no, you're all racist.
[01:23:18.457 --> 01:23:22.319]  And some Americans end up believing that, thinking, oh my God, there's all these racists out there.
[01:23:22.779 --> 01:23:24.140]  Isn't that what's racist?
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.301]  To claim it's all racist?
[01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:29.202]  Injecting race card into something that isn't even about that?
[01:23:29.702 --> 01:23:37.886]  The people that are challenging these gatherings, and quite frankly, I had hoped it would bring out more people than it did, but it sent a little bit of a message.
[01:23:38.462 --> 01:23:40.904]  The message was that these are homogeneous groups.
[01:23:40.984 --> 01:23:48.229]  I mean, these were people from all across the socioeconomic and political spectrum saying enough is enough with the federal government.
[01:23:48.469 --> 01:23:49.670]  Were the numbers overwhelming?
[01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:50.350]  No, they weren't.
[01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:51.291]  Were they peaceful?
[01:23:51.391 --> 01:23:52.011]  Absolutely.
[01:23:52.211 --> 01:23:53.092]  Was I at all of them?
[01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:56.314]  No, I monitored many of them through our facilities here at Fox.
[01:23:56.434 --> 01:23:59.236]  I heard nothing even remotely racist.
[01:23:59.697 --> 01:24:07.422]  Look, if the pro-Obama forces think that they can tarnish with the word racism,
[01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:16.554]  Anybody who disagrees with them, they are in for a very, very serious battle and their Orwellian redefinition of words simply won't work.
[01:24:17.034 --> 01:24:20.175]  I disagree with this president on almost everything he does.
[01:24:20.775 --> 01:24:22.276]  I am an anti-racist.
[01:24:22.396 --> 01:24:24.217]  My new book, Dred Scott's Revenge,
[01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:31.797]  The legal history of race and freedom in America was written to remind white people what blacks went through in this country.
[01:24:32.097 --> 01:24:34.960]  That doesn't mean I agree with everything the president has done.
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.982]  In fact, I disagree with almost all of it.
[01:24:37.242 --> 01:24:44.849]  I would defy anybody who disagrees with him on ideological or political grounds to say that that disagreement is racially based.
[01:24:47.199 --> 01:24:50.900]  Well, I mean, it's just a complete distraction, isn't it, Judge, from reality?
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:25:11.128]  People, they're saying, we don't want more taxes, we don't want more regulation, and they run the President, the American people elect him, and then they say, if you criticize anything he's doing, youth brigades, tattletale squads, government money being spent on USA Service to create a private army for the Democrats, they just say, every single one of you is a racist.
[01:25:11.608 --> 01:25:13.989]  I mean, that is just outrageous propaganda.
[01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:16.150]  Well, it's outrageous because it reveals
[01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:18.811]  The moral depravity of their argument.
[01:25:18.891 --> 01:25:28.756]  They're unwilling to engage people who challenge the federal government in a meaningful debate about the appropriate role of the federal government in our constitutional society.
[01:25:29.176 --> 01:25:34.079]  And in order to avoid that challenge, they touch the third rail of American politics, which is racism.
[01:25:34.519 --> 01:25:36.020]  But this will not last.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:43.083]  The American people will realize that the folks who are in favor of big government cannot avoid the debate
[01:25:43.499 --> 01:25:49.746]  By claiming that everyone that wants to challenge big government is a racist because the head of the government happens to be biracial.
[01:25:50.147 --> 01:25:55.813]  I happen to think it's a great thing that the head of the government is a biracial to try and put race behind us.
[01:25:56.275 --> 01:26:01.176]  Even though I disagree with this president on virtually everything he stands for.
[01:26:01.376 --> 01:26:05.297]  But they want to continue to now inject race into it.
[01:26:05.317 --> 01:26:06.117]  It's race baiting.
[01:26:06.377 --> 01:26:08.778]  It's actually creating racial division.
[01:26:09.318 --> 01:26:10.038]  Isn't that funny?
[01:26:10.078 --> 01:26:15.760]  Because the Department of Homeland Security report, which came out last week, condemned race baiting.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:23.041]  Even though the administration that produced it is now using it in order to avoid confronting the issues.
[01:26:23.382 --> 01:26:24.522]  Do you think that was a...
[01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.372]  Political H-bomb?
[01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:46.597]  Or, I mean, how big a deal is this that we always explain to people this police state apparatus for Al-Qaeda was really being set up for the American people, and now all these federal and state MIAC reports and intelligence reports are out saying gun owners, people buying ammo, veterans are the number one threat.
[01:26:47.397 --> 01:26:50.278]  I think that this is really a wake-up call.
[01:26:51.878 --> 01:26:54.479]  I think that the DHS report
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:12.484]  Was a bucket of cold water in the face of many conservative Republicans who are pro-life, who are pro-gun, who do welcome returning veterans, who are concerned about the borders, and who are concerned about the size and scope of the federal government.
[01:27:12.525 --> 01:27:14.345]  Why do I tick off those five attributes?
[01:27:14.864 --> 01:27:27.454]  Because the report says people who embrace any of those five causes on that side, on the gun side, on the life side, on the anti-federal government side, are as dangerous as race-based skinheads.
[01:27:28.335 --> 01:27:34.440]  And I say to my conservative Republican friends, or they say to me, well how can the government monitor me?
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.484]  How does the government know that I'm pro-life, that I'm pro-gun?
[01:27:40.037 --> 01:27:43.098]  That I question the size and scope of the federal government.
[01:27:43.118 --> 01:27:50.101]  I say, well, remember, the government can listen to your phone calls and can monitor the keystrokes on your computer without a warrant these days.
[01:27:50.461 --> 01:27:54.383]  DHS agents, just like FBI agents, can write their own search warrants.
[01:27:54.403 --> 01:27:55.463]  They don't have to go to a judge.
[01:27:55.783 --> 01:27:58.244]  They don't have to present probable cause of crime anymore.
[01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:01.886]  And then my conservative Republican friends say, well, where did that come from?
[01:28:02.466 --> 01:28:09.089]  And then I say, the Patriot Act, which George Bush and the conservative Republicans in the Congress gave to us.
[01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:14.754]  The people that wrote this abominable law trusted Bush and his agents with this power.
[01:28:15.094 --> 01:28:23.501]  It's now in the hands of President Obama and his agents, and suddenly they regret and resent having given that kind of power to the federal government.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.843]  And that's my final question, and I want to talk about all the books you've written here.
[01:28:27.883 --> 01:28:31.825]  Briefly, Judge Napolitano, you say you're talking to a lot of high-powered Republicans.
[01:28:31.846 --> 01:28:33.246]  I know you talk to them on TV every day.
[01:28:33.647 --> 01:28:39.611]  They're starting to figure out now what they let the government, the powers that they let the government get?
[01:28:40.219 --> 01:28:51.582]  They handed to President Obama an imperial presidency with powers far greater than what Bill Clinton handed to George W. Bush.
[01:28:52.002 --> 01:28:54.662]  The Republicans created that imperial presidency.
[01:28:55.042 --> 01:29:02.144]  It is as disrespectful, it is as faithless to the Constitution as anything FDR did.
[01:29:02.512 --> 01:29:13.916]  And it may be as faithless to the Constitution as Abraham Lincoln in terms of its violation of natural rights and its violation of specifically enunciated rights in the Constitution itself.
[01:29:14.437 --> 01:29:20.279]  What do you think about the left, a lot of them defending Obama now and hiring nothing but lobbyists, expanding wars?
[01:29:21.599 --> 01:29:26.282]  Saying they're going to expand warrantless spying, saying he's going to keep all these new powers.
[01:29:26.743 --> 01:29:32.487]  I mean, I know we're used to politicians lying, but he said this is going to be different this time.
[01:29:33.567 --> 01:29:34.208]  Well, he's not.
[01:29:34.428 --> 01:29:48.417]  I mean, he has kept this awful, hideous thing in play called State Secrets, which is basically a doctrine that if the government makes enough of a hue and cry that it can't reveal what's in its bag of tricks,
[01:29:49.085 --> 01:29:52.529]  That a lawsuit goes away, lest state secrets be revealed.
[01:29:52.569 --> 01:29:57.233]  Of course, when the government loses that argument, it turns out that no state secrets in fact were revealed.
[01:29:57.594 --> 01:30:02.198]  Barack Obama condemned this concept when he was Senator Obama and candidate Obama.
[01:30:02.599 --> 01:30:06.102]  He's now instructed his Justice Department to continue the same thing.
[01:30:06.382 --> 01:30:08.905]  Look, it's a liberal version of big government.
[01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:11.783]  Versus a conservative version of big government.
[01:30:12.063 --> 01:30:14.085]  It is disrespect for the individual.
[01:30:14.345 --> 01:30:17.648]  It is the exaltation of the state over the individual.
[01:30:17.768 --> 01:30:21.552]  It's the same thing over and over and over again.
[01:30:22.072 --> 01:30:24.795]  Instead of corporate welfare, there's individual welfare.
[01:30:25.195 --> 01:30:29.759]  Instead of allowing the rich to get richer, it will try and pull down the rich in order to uplift the poor.
[01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:32.021]  None of this planned
[01:30:32.842 --> 01:30:34.644]  Central economic planning.
[01:30:35.024 --> 01:30:39.947]  None of this assault on civil liberties has ever produced happiness or prosperity.
[01:30:40.288 --> 01:30:43.710]  The question is, when and how will we stop it?
[01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:49.515]  Yeah, they're trying to hang this banking disaster around the necks of free market people, and this isn't free market.
[01:30:49.915 --> 01:31:01.844]  This is government teaming up with select corporations and producing fraudulent debt instruments, fraudulent Ponzi schemes, and then government is now taking 12.8 trillion of tax money
[01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:04.865]  And giving it to the crooks instead of arresting them!
[01:31:05.285 --> 01:31:21.009]  Well, listen, the banks that were giving mortgages out for no money down... George W. Bush ordered his Housing and Urban Development Department, HUD, to give out mortgages with no money down to 150,000 people.
[01:31:21.069 --> 01:31:24.109]  The vast majority of those things have already defaulted.
[01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:25.790]  And who got those mortgages?
[01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:27.410]  Fannie and Freddie.
[01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:28.671]  And where do they get their money?
[01:31:29.051 --> 01:31:29.951]  From the taxpayer.
[01:31:30.419 --> 01:31:36.702]  I mean, the bankers were doing what the government instructed them to do.
[01:31:37.143 --> 01:31:47.248]  Get mortgages to people who are not credit worthy, use low teaser rates, keep the rates artificially low, don't worry what will happen when the rates go up there.
[01:31:47.428 --> 01:31:49.669]  This was not the free market run amok.
[01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:52.591]  This was the banking system doing what the government
[01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:54.062]  Forced it to do.
[01:31:54.402 --> 01:31:58.646]  And like all central planning, it came down with a crash.
[01:31:58.986 --> 01:31:59.707]  Absolutely.
[01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:03.130]  In closing, tell us about your newest book and some of the others, Judge Andrew Peloton.
[01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:15.301]  I was sitting on the radio with Brian Kilmeade, my partner, listening to a lot of well-intended African-American callers, not outraged by Jeremiah Wright.
[01:32:15.839 --> 01:32:17.961]  I'm thinking to myself, what the heck is going on here?
[01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:21.825]  Why are they not outraged that he's saying things like the government caused AIDS?
[01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:23.887]  And I went back and did a lot of research.
[01:32:23.907 --> 01:32:25.268]  Well, the government didn't cause AIDS.
[01:32:25.728 --> 01:32:32.955]  The government did give syphilis to hundreds and hundreds of innocent black men that the federal government said it was curing.
[01:32:33.095 --> 01:32:34.837]  In fact, it was slowly killing them.
[01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:39.725]  It went on from the FDR administration until Richard Nixon learned about it, and he stopped.
[01:32:40.005 --> 01:32:51.274]  The government did suspend the free will of African Americans based on collectivism, based on race, based upon the notion that the government can enact whatever laws it wants.
[01:32:51.994 --> 01:33:01.321]  And I wanted to remind white people what blacks went through, because if the government can do this to a group of people based on race,
[01:33:02.068 --> 01:33:05.310]  It could do it to a group of people based on their ideas.
[01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:14.175]  And what happened to African Americans in 1860 and in 1960 could happen to you and me in 2010.
[01:33:14.295 --> 01:33:16.697]  Well, you're a great writer.
[01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:17.257]  I want to read.
[01:33:17.297 --> 01:33:18.037]  I've read some of your other books.
[01:33:18.058 --> 01:33:21.620]  I haven't read The Dread, Scott's Revenge, but we've got it up on screen right now.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.741]  Fire up some of the websites so folks can find out more.
[01:33:23.761 --> 01:33:25.162]  Thank you so much.
[01:33:27.163 --> 01:33:28.884]  What are some of the best websites to visit, though?
[01:33:28.904 --> 01:33:30.485]  I know there's quite a few you're associated with.
[01:33:31.533 --> 01:33:37.774]  Well, LewRockwell.com is very, very generous to me, and a lot of my things are published there.
[01:33:37.834 --> 01:33:43.976]  I'm also posted on FoxNews.com probably once or twice a week.
[01:33:44.756 --> 01:33:52.838]  If you go to FoxNews.com Freedom Watch, or if you just plug in Freedom Watch on YouTube, you'll find hundreds and hundreds of websites
[01:33:53.522 --> 01:33:56.904]  Uh, that capture my show, Freedom Watch, and that, uh, spread it all over the place.
[01:33:57.165 --> 01:34:00.007]  Look, uh, my show two weeks ago had 500,000 hits.
[01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:09.913]  That's- I won't name the name of networks, but that's more than at least, uh, two cable, uh, networks have in one case all day, in another case all week!
[01:34:10.834 --> 01:34:16.837]  Just my one hour watching and arguing about and explaining the loss of freedom in America.
[01:34:16.857 --> 01:34:32.844]  Well, that shows how hungry people are, is that Fox is now intelligently putting the real, you know, truth, you know, you on the air, but internet only, and it's bigger than the other little rinky-dink networks with the CIA officer
[01:34:33.886 --> 01:34:48.713]  Uh, over there, the heir to the Astor family saying that the weird sexual stuff that the Tea Parties are doing, and saying we're all racist, and the other network, and it's the same thing here, I put out the Obama deception, over 15 million views in five weeks.
[01:34:50.293 --> 01:34:51.094]  Oh, it's insane.
[01:34:51.154 --> 01:34:52.794]  You're dwarfing my numbers, Alex.
[01:34:52.814 --> 01:34:54.475]  I gotta learn some of your secrets.
[01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:55.155]  No, no, no.
[01:34:55.215 --> 01:34:56.076]  Hey, hey, no, no, no.
[01:34:56.116 --> 01:34:57.436]  You just started your new TV show.
[01:34:57.456 --> 01:35:06.199]  You know, you're contributing on the main channel, but, I mean, no, that's what I'm saying, is that 500,000 on one little video you did, and you're doing them all the time, I'm saying that's huge.
[01:35:06.239 --> 01:35:14.142]  Most of our videos probably get 20, 30, 40,000 views, but, I mean, to sit there and to see that you're doing that, that shows me people are hungry for the truth.
[01:35:14.482 --> 01:35:15.903]  It shows me the statist are in trouble.
[01:35:16.716 --> 01:35:17.337]  Absolutely.
[01:35:17.857 --> 01:35:18.357]  Absolutely.
[01:35:18.417 --> 01:35:23.221]  And I wrote this book to remind people what runaway statism can produce.
[01:35:24.061 --> 01:35:24.702]  Absolutely.
[01:35:24.882 --> 01:35:29.665]  And the thugs are trying to keep us under control, the left-wing and right-wing thugs.
[01:35:30.085 --> 01:35:35.509]  And Judge, if good people just lift a finger together, I don't see the system being able to get away with it.
[01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:37.811]  But they're not going to go away without a fight.
[01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:38.897]  No, they're not.
[01:35:39.257 --> 01:35:43.339]  And that's why we have to stay on the air and keep monitoring what's happening.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:44.640]  You've been good to have me on.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.861]  I love every minute of it, Alex.
[01:35:46.161 --> 01:35:46.861]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:35:46.921 --> 01:35:48.822]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:35:48.862 --> 01:35:49.542]  See you at Freedom Watch.
[01:35:49.582 --> 01:35:49.923]  Take care.
[01:35:50.303 --> 01:35:50.583]  Thank you.
[01:35:50.603 --> 01:35:50.903]  Bye-bye.
[01:35:50.923 --> 01:35:51.904]  All right, there he goes.
[01:35:51.924 --> 01:35:53.624]  I think they're going to have me back on next week or something.
[01:35:54.105 --> 01:35:55.285]  Okay, good having him on.
[01:35:55.325 --> 01:35:56.886]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:57.206 --> 01:35:58.187]  This is what blows me away.
[01:35:58.207 --> 01:36:06.090]  If you look at the ratings of MSNBC and CNBC, they'll have like 100,000 viewers at 10 o'clock at night.
[01:36:10.066 --> 01:36:12.246]  And their top shows all have like 500,000.
[01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:17.448]  No one is watching this crap.
[01:36:17.808 --> 01:36:24.609]  Now Fox is smart and acts like they're anti-New World Order, so they're 3, 4 million, 5 million people watching.
[01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:32.251]  Still, when you get into real ratings, Coast to Coast AM has 16 million listeners a night.
[01:36:32.311 --> 01:36:33.991]  Rush Limbaugh has 22 million a day.
[01:36:38.741 --> 01:36:41.023]  That's the real radio shows, folks.
[01:36:41.584 --> 01:36:44.547]  Then you look at me, down here in the minor leagues, comparatively.
[01:36:44.707 --> 01:36:46.889]  I dwarf MSNBC and CNBC.
[01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:53.535]  But they can get advertisers to spend $50,000 for a minute ad, and they're getting no response.
[01:36:53.596 --> 01:36:54.396]  It's all made up.
[01:36:54.757 --> 01:36:55.457]  It's all fake.
[01:36:55.778 --> 01:36:56.618]  It's all imaginary.
[01:36:57.557 --> 01:37:00.799]  We'll be lucky if we can get a hundred dollars a spot here.
[01:37:00.879 --> 01:37:02.920]  That's how backwards it is.
[01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:10.225]  Because it's the delusionalness of the teleprompters, of the fanciness of all of that.
[01:37:10.785 --> 01:37:18.270]  That's why I thought about maybe I should come in here and wear a suit and make it look like a regular TV studio and all our problems will be over and we could actually defeat the New World War raising the capital.
[01:37:19.847 --> 01:37:23.208]  I mean, we're on over 70 AM and FM stations now.
[01:37:23.248 --> 01:37:24.528]  We've got a lot of new affiliates.
[01:37:24.568 --> 01:37:25.868]  Very thankful to all those stations.
[01:37:26.088 --> 01:37:28.008]  And those stations, you know, get the ratings in.
[01:37:28.028 --> 01:37:29.649]  And it's hundreds of thousands of listeners.
[01:37:29.729 --> 01:37:31.589]  Smaller stations, tens of thousands when I'm on.
[01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:39.250]  Conservatively, Ted has, because a lot of stations don't subscribe to the Arbiton ratings, so they don't have them, smaller stations.
[01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:42.551]  But Ted has gone and gotten the ratings for 315,000 listeners every 15 minutes.
[01:37:42.571 --> 01:37:42.891]  315,000 on AM and FM!
[01:37:49.292 --> 01:37:53.894]  And it's actually a lot more than that, because about half our stations don't subscribe to the Arbitron, so they can't use those numbers.
[01:37:53.914 --> 01:37:59.577]  You've got to pay to be able to subscribe and find out what your ratings are, because it costs money to do the ratings.
[01:38:00.218 --> 01:38:02.679]  So, let's say conservatively, 500,000 listeners every 15 minutes.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.501]  People always ask, how many listeners do I have?
[01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:11.382]  I kind of, when mainstream media is here, go, oh, not that many, but, you know, the whole point is, might as well just admit it to people.
[01:38:12.002 --> 01:38:15.423]  Millions and millions listening on AM and FM every day in the four hours.
[01:38:16.163 --> 01:38:17.624]  Number one on Shoutcast.
[01:38:18.064 --> 01:38:20.064]  Number one radio talk show on Shoutcast.
[01:38:20.324 --> 01:38:22.325]  About to be number one over music, even.
[01:38:22.985 --> 01:38:25.006]  About to be total number one.
[01:38:26.466 --> 01:38:33.028]  And we haven't even figured out how to get all the people listening to our streams to get those connected in where it shows up on Shoutcast.
[01:38:34.414 --> 01:38:36.654]  That you're not even seeing all of our listeners on there.
[01:38:37.715 --> 01:38:40.815]  With the Windows stream and some Flash stream and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:38:40.835 --> 01:38:42.036]  There's thousands you can't see.
[01:38:42.556 --> 01:38:46.897]  And then, there's the YouTube and the Google and all the videos people post to the audio.
[01:38:47.037 --> 01:38:49.997]  It is just ultra-massive.
[01:38:50.017 --> 01:38:53.118]  Go ahead and start playing this newscast clip.
[01:38:53.138 --> 01:38:55.458]  We're going to come back with it and finish up on the other side.
[01:38:56.579 --> 01:38:59.539]  Simon Johnson declares influence of Wall Street oligarchs, U.S.
[01:38:59.579 --> 01:39:01.780]  and Banana Republic on mainstream television.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:02.120]  Here it is.
[01:39:02.878 --> 01:39:08.700]  Contrary to the assertions of many politicians in Wall Street, the crisis that we're going through is not new at all.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:19.163]  In fact, our guest today, Simon Johnson, who's a former economist for the IMF and currently a professor at MIT, says that when he was at the IMF, he saw this crisis over and over again.
[01:39:19.223 --> 01:39:23.224]  It was just happening in emerging markets instead of in a country like the United States.
[01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:25.565]  So, Professor, what are the similarities?
[01:39:26.852 --> 01:39:39.437]  Well, Henry, I'm drawing on my experience, roughly 20 years of working on crises, not just at the IMF, but when I was working in the private sector at the University, with the IMF, and sometimes on the same side, sometimes not so much.
[01:39:39.977 --> 01:39:43.659]  And the key thing is, of course, you have a boom, you have a group that drives an economy up,
[01:39:44.039 --> 01:39:56.428]  They're often called the oligarchs in various countries, and they do well for themselves and for the country for a while, but then comes a bust, some sort of crisis of confidence, and the oligarchs are a big problem at that point.
[01:39:56.648 --> 01:40:06.635]  And that might be my point about the United States, is we've built up a financial sector, we've built up some... We're going to come back, and we're going to play the end of this, and hit a few other little tidbits here, so be sure and stay with us.
[01:40:07.036 --> 01:40:09.858]  The final segment, stay the course, we'll be right back, InfoWars.com.
[01:40:15.492 --> 01:40:20.794]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[01:40:21.254 --> 01:40:22.994]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[01:40:23.535 --> 01:40:25.015]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[01:40:25.675 --> 01:40:29.236]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[01:40:29.677 --> 01:40:33.178]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[01:40:33.658 --> 01:40:40.640]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:44.620]  We're good.
[01:41:14.102 --> 01:41:19.341]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:41:20.126 --> 01:41:25.470]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:41:26.011 --> 01:41:32.215]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:41:32.515 --> 01:41:34.337]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:41:34.477 --> 01:41:36.879]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:41:36.939 --> 01:41:47.827]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:41:50.114 --> 01:41:51.394]  It's not about left or right.
[01:41:51.794 --> 01:41:53.175]  It's about a one world government.
[01:41:53.655 --> 01:41:59.977]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.580]  The people strike back.
[01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:15.071]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[01:42:15.332 --> 01:42:20.075]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[01:42:20.516 --> 01:42:22.957]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.

[01:42:33.625 --> 01:42:34.666]  Do you own a firearm?

[01:43:02.363 --> 01:43:02.623]  That's 1-877-608-0179.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.801]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:43:19.361 --> 01:43:22.161]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:43:22.261 --> 01:43:39.666]  By the way, we've been watching this video of El Paso, Texas with a reporter trying to get video of a truck tumped over and the cop runs over and arrests him.
[01:43:40.826 --> 01:43:44.527]  And there's, looks like Marines running around in the video.
[01:43:44.547 --> 01:43:46.908]  If you watch it carefully, ordering the police around.
[01:43:47.568 --> 01:43:50.470]  And we know they're out there, so it's just all part of the insanity.
[01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:53.831]  I want to finish up this clip where they're talking about the oligarchs running things.
[01:43:54.911 --> 01:43:58.852]  The banking oligarchs that rule us, that are now even directing our governments.
[01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:00.533]  That's right.
[01:44:01.173 --> 01:44:01.934]  They're not elected.
[01:44:02.794 --> 01:44:05.775]  They go on national TV and say that we're above the government.
[01:44:07.844 --> 01:44:09.926]  The current Fed Chief's done that, so has Alan Greenspan.
[01:44:09.946 --> 01:44:10.586]  I'm getting sick of it.
[01:44:11.687 --> 01:44:13.148]  But first, I want to tell you about something cool.
[01:44:13.188 --> 01:44:14.749]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:44:14.789 --> 01:44:17.251]  It's halfway down the right-hand side.
[01:44:17.771 --> 01:44:21.534]  There's a company that puts out ringtones, and they thought, hey, we want to put out some Alex Jones ringtones.
[01:44:21.894 --> 01:44:23.736]  This is a great way to stir up conversations.
[01:44:23.776 --> 01:44:24.796]  People say, what is that?
[01:44:25.257 --> 01:44:26.258]  You've got to go hear these things.
[01:44:26.278 --> 01:44:27.318]  You can listen to them for free.
[01:44:28.119 --> 01:44:28.739]  They're on the side.
[01:44:28.779 --> 01:44:32.262]  It's, again, on the right-hand side, about a halfway down.
[01:44:34.369 --> 01:45:00.034]  on the uh... side there it is up on screen in prison planet dot t the and uh... you can go there and click on it at info wars dot com we've added the ringtone store turn your phone into part of the info war you can get dozens of ringtones they'll wake up everyone around you go to the square banners and for wars and check it out download ringtones with me in support the info war right now absolutely do you want info wars ringtones
[01:45:00.974 --> 01:45:01.334]  You got it.
[01:45:01.354 --> 01:45:03.155]  In fact, there's a URL for that they have.
[01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:04.316]  What's the actual URL?
[01:45:05.537 --> 01:45:06.518]  Up there at the top of the screen?
[01:45:08.599 --> 01:45:10.160]  AlexJonesRingtones.net.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:11.440]  AlexJonesRingtones.net.
[01:45:11.561 --> 01:45:11.821]  Okay.
[01:45:12.201 --> 01:45:13.382]  Let's go ahead and finish up with this clip.
[01:45:13.402 --> 01:45:13.682]  Here it is.
[01:45:19.972 --> 01:45:21.033]  Oh, that side shut down?
[01:45:21.053 --> 01:45:29.258]  Not just at the IMF, but when I was working in the private sector at the university, with the IMF, and sometimes on the same side, sometimes not so much.
[01:45:29.778 --> 01:45:46.228]  And their key thing is, of course, you have a boom, you have a group that drives an economy up, they're often called the oligarchs in various countries, and they do well for themselves and for the country for a while, but then comes a bust, some sort of crisis of confidence, and the oligarchs are a big problem at that point.
[01:45:46.728 --> 01:46:07.005]  That's my point about the United States, is we built up a financial sector, we built up some very strong players in that financial sector, and it was fine for as long as the boom lasted, but it built vulnerabilities into the system, and those vulnerabilities are very hard to overcome, because these powerful people, these oligarchs in the United States, remain so strong and so central to everything.
[01:46:07.285 --> 01:46:22.198]  And you sound as though you wrote a very well-received article in the Atlantic where you lay all this out recently, but it sounds as though you feel like policy is still being dictated by Washington effectively kowtowing to the oligarchs, who are the names we all know and love from Wall Street.
[01:46:23.487 --> 01:46:27.669]  I think big finance, the major banks on Wall Street, are far too influential.
[01:46:27.849 --> 01:46:30.830]  I'm not saying they're dictating it, but they're having a huge amount of impact.
[01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:42.394]  And you can see them negotiating with the government, actually through the newspapers a lot now, where the head of JP Morgan or the head of Goldman will make statements that are clearly designed to push the government in certain directions.
[01:46:42.695 --> 01:46:48.157]  And of course, it's not just their ties to the administration, they're also incredibly well connected on Capitol Hill.
[01:46:48.477 --> 01:46:51.358]  And that's an important part of how they get things done also.
[01:46:51.858 --> 01:46:54.259]  And so how do these situations resolve themselves?
[01:46:54.299 --> 01:46:57.801]  If you go back to the IMF and a typical emerging market, what happens?
[01:46:57.861 --> 01:46:59.102]  How do you break that cycle?
[01:46:59.442 --> 01:47:00.723]  Well, there has to be a shift in power.
[01:47:00.963 --> 01:47:07.566]  And in most countries that the IMF has traditionally dealt with, there's a crisis, a severe crisis, and pretty much an economic and financial collapse.
[01:47:07.926 --> 01:47:10.327]  And in that situation, some of the powerful players lose out.
[01:47:10.628 --> 01:47:11.228]  Now, the IMF
[01:47:12.072 --> 01:47:21.587]  When it comes in, if it sees the situation clearly, and in my view does its job properly, it'll help tilt the balance so that you can... Okay, now remember, the IMF is European.
[01:47:21.607 --> 01:47:25.112]  Okay, and dominated.
[01:47:25.212 --> 01:47:27.055]  They want control of the United States.
[01:47:27.956 --> 01:47:29.337]  And so this is a fight with the bankers.
[01:47:29.377 --> 01:47:33.458]  He's on there kind of telling on himself a little bit to get more power and control.
[01:47:33.498 --> 01:47:34.198]  But there they are.
[01:47:34.258 --> 01:47:36.039]  Very interesting video clip.
[01:47:36.059 --> 01:47:39.860]  The rest of it's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.781]  Jason Bermas, live tonight, 9 to midnight, right here at Genesis.

[01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:52.845]  We're winning the fight against tyranny.
[01:47:54.805 --> 01:47:56.546]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:47:58.357 --> 01:48:01.779]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.941]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:48:05.061 --> 01:48:09.703]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:12.545]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[01:48:12.745 --> 01:48:15.606]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:48:15.786 --> 01:48:21.689]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:22.790]  No one is going to take care of
