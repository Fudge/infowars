[00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:42.433]  Hello, friends.
[00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:43.413]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:48.137]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:51.039]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.121]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.904]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:03.327]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:10.491]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.713]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:30.199]  Take action today.
[00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.659]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:46.532]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:49.894]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:56.958]  Big Brother.
[00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.679]  Mainstream media.
[00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:00.520]  Government cover-ups.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.981]  You want answers?
[00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:03.682]  Well, so does he.
[00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:07.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:12.527]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:17.906]  Well, we just celebrated the nation's birthday.
[00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:19.828]  And let me tell you, it may be one of our last.
[00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:29.117]  I'm sure as we're a regional slave holding of the New World Order, they'll still have the fireworks displays for the slaves.
[00:02:29.457 --> 00:02:30.938]  But they do have a bad carbon footprint.
[00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.081]  They do put off carbon dioxide and may need to be banned.
[00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.223]  They're actually calling for that.
[00:02:35.243 --> 00:02:36.464]  In fact, oh, people won't believe me.
[00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.567]  Google fireworks
[00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:42.688]  Carbon footprint.
[00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.610]  Bad for greenhouse gases.
[00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.457]  See, the global carbon tax is all about micromanaging and regulating every facet of your life.
[00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:56.962]  So, you may still have the fireworks, you're just going to pay a big tax to be able to have the fireworks.
[00:02:57.563 --> 00:03:05.210]  And the government can selectively enforce and control who can have a factory and who can't.
[00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:07.732]  Who can have a car dealership and who can't?
[00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:10.054]  Now that the federal government runs General Motors.
[00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:13.597]  Whoever is friends of the government, the Democratic Party, they get to stay open.
[00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:16.839]  If you don't, work with the mafia, you get closed.
[00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:17.920]  That's on record.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.863]  This is the out-of-control wickedness we're all witnessing.
[00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:26.006]  Now, I have noticed that
[00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:35.727]  Every time, it's summertime, the last 10 years, they get on the news and they say, global warming has caused this.
[00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:44.851]  We're having a hot summer in Texas or in Illinois or in California, wherever it is, because of global warming.
[00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:50.595]  There you go!
[00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:54.082]  Mainstream News, London Guardian, ban the fireworks displays.
[00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:54.804]  Print that for me.
[00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:56.708]  See, everything's going to get banned.
[00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.552]  But see, actually, it's not going to get banned.
[00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:01.237]  You're just going to pay your cut to Don Carleone.
[00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.291]  The Carbon Cops.
[00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:05.012]  Pull it up for them.
[00:04:05.072 --> 00:04:07.053]  Pull up Carbon Climate Cops.
[00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:12.958]  And it shows the kids in their red and black uniforms in England and the US, the cartoon characters of two years ago.
[00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:18.201]  Now the real uniforms are the Climate Cop uniforms, red and black.
[00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:20.163]  Show them the Climate Cops.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.124]  And then show them city year climate cops.
[00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:37.113]  Two years later, it goes from taught in public schools about here are the climate cops, report on your parents, there the little bastards are, to actual uniforms.
[00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:39.015]  See, it's a vortex of evil.
[00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:46.461]  In fact, we ought to pull up the New York Times where it shows the little girl reporting on mommy and writing tickets because mommy takes a hot bath.
[00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:49.233]  And that that's a climate crime?
[00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.554]  And the mother says, oh, I'm so glad my daughter's reporting on me?
[00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:54.196]  In fact, Google this.
[00:04:54.897 --> 00:04:55.417]  Climate...
[00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:02.215]  Government textbook, Australian textbook, teaches children to commit suicide.
[00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:06.878]  And they had an accompanying video game where it tells the children you're supposed to kill yourselves.
[00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:07.618]  And this is thought.
[00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:13.821]  And then mainly the girls get sad for the earth, sad for the kitties and stuff, literally, and go hang themselves.
[00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.301]  And there's a little celebration.
[00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:17.622]  Oh, for the earth.
[00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:18.543]  Very sick.
[00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:23.265]  See, everything's just totally sick, totally evil, totally insane, and then I'm the same one.
[00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:24.306]  A lot of you are sane.
[00:05:24.726 --> 00:05:31.390]  We see all of this as totally insane and sickening for what it is, and it drives us crazy, and we get upset, and then we're the bad ones.
[00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.811]  We're the evil ones.
[00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:36.913]  Steve Watson wrote an article about it.
[00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:45.898]  Just type, just type, type, website, ABC website, with ABC News Australia,
[00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:48.307]  Teach his kids to kill themselves.
[00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:49.628]  It'll come up for you.
[00:05:50.349 --> 00:06:04.081]  You know, when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, and I know a lot of people are watching this at PrisonPlanet.tv in the archives, or when it gets ripped to the web later, all over the planet, I want the first thing viewers out there to see is say, number one, I'm not going to believe Alex Jones.
[00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:06.943]  I'm going to go check everything he just said.
[00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.145]  And I'm going to look it up for myself.
[00:06:11.178 --> 00:06:15.523]  And then ask yourselves, is Alex getting angry enough about this?
[00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:26.874]  Because I think when they're training kids worldwide to go write dossiers on their parents, and they have the parents in the newspapers everywhere saying it's good, I love my kids reporting on me, I think we have a problem.
[00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:31.059]  And it gets worse.
[00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:32.593]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:34.854]  ABC website tells kids they should die.
[00:06:35.674 --> 00:06:38.415]  And that's from news.com.au.
[00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:39.576]  That's from mainstream.
[00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:43.417]  Click on the link, take them to the actual Australian side or they won't believe it.
[00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:45.078]  That was from prisonplanet.com.
[00:06:46.298 --> 00:06:47.518]  They must see it for themselves.
[00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:49.899]  They must face it for themselves.
[00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:51.740]  Is teaching children to kill themselves good?
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.343]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:55.494]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:57.534]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:07:57.754 --> 00:08:06.016]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:11.498]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:08:11.818 --> 00:08:13.438]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:08:13.678 --> 00:08:20.003]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:08:20.203 --> 00:08:30.952]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:31.773]  That's right.
[00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.315]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:36.157]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:38.739]  We're good to go.
[00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:57.059]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[00:08:57.359 --> 00:08:58.520]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.622]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:09:02.923 --> 00:09:04.484]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:09:04.784 --> 00:09:11.087]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:09:12.228 --> 00:09:14.769]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:16.569]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.610]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.291]  And their formula really works.
[00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:24.112]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:09:24.372 --> 00:09:25.652]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:09:25.872 --> 00:09:30.274]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:32.835]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:09:33.035 --> 00:09:35.295]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:09:35.516 --> 00:09:37.256]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:38.717]  Go to www.
[00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:44.980]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:09.322]  For stations that just joined us, coming up in this shower, I'm going to get into the hate crimes bill, the subsections again, because we're about to lose the First Amendment.
[00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:10.863]  I mean, officially gone.
[00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:12.263]  On paper.
[00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:15.204]  If this passes the Senate this week, it's passed the House.
[00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:27.408]  And other hate crimes bills just stated that certain groups would be given special treatment if they had a crime committed against them.
[00:10:29.144 --> 00:10:34.308]  But now it just says that if you hurt someone's feelings, you're going to go to prison for 10 years.
[00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.132]  And it's going to pass.
[00:10:38.192 --> 00:10:39.012]  I can't believe this.
[00:10:39.864 --> 00:10:40.965]  I mean, it's going to become law.
[00:10:41.025 --> 00:10:42.886]  Now, we've got to ignore it and say no to it.
[00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:46.487]  Kind of like the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform.
[00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:50.529]  Tripled the money lobbyists could give, but restricted what individuals could give.
[00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.471]  And banned talk radio on paper.
[00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:59.654]  You know, they made this claim that I can't have Larry Pratt on, say, from Gun Owners of America.
[00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.115]  Or six weeks before an election.
[00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:08.218]  Or if I wanted to have somebody on, say, from Greenpeace before an election, I can't.
[00:11:08.238 --> 00:11:09.039]  Have I agreed with that?
[00:11:09.966 --> 00:11:13.608]  Or if I wanted to have somebody on from the Boll Weevil Association, whatever that is.
[00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:16.029]  You know, the point is, no free speech.
[00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:17.830]  People just said, you know what, we're going to ignore you.
[00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:22.113]  Because a lot of this stuff is so criminal and over the top that we can just ignore it.
[00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:26.395]  But everything's carbon taxes.
[00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:28.556]  I want to get into that first and then some more of your phone calls.
[00:11:30.817 --> 00:11:33.379]  I told you that in Europe and California,
[00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:42.560]  Also Canada is wanting to put taxes on fireplaces, space heaters, outdoor space heaters to tax them or outright ban them.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.262]  I told you there's a move to ban fireworks because they put off carbon.
[00:11:48.616 --> 00:11:49.457]  Everything's carbon.
[00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:50.738]  We're carbon-based life forms.
[00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.420]  It's making us illegal, as the Club of Rome said.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.363]  It's a disgusting tax on all life, all activity, everything.
[00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:58.123]  The life cycle.
[00:11:58.403 --> 00:12:00.005]  It's a tax on what plants breathe.
[00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:01.526]  It is not a nerve gas.
[00:12:01.566 --> 00:12:02.586]  It is not a chemical weapon.
[00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:03.647]  It is not a devil weapon.
[00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:08.030]  It is not a satanic weapon of devilry.
[00:12:08.631 --> 00:12:10.092]  It is carbon dioxide.
[00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:14.015]  But I was in Target, just trying to buy some t-shirts.
[00:12:16.517 --> 00:12:27.090]  And they were all saying environmentally safe, zero carbon footprint for the earth and I couldn't buy them because I was giving money to a Nazi regime.
[00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.232]  I was giving money
[00:12:29.727 --> 00:12:45.017]  To something that's going to be used for eugenics, because they take the money from all this Green Revolution on record, then they roll in with investment for the poor, with the sterilization shots, with the HIV shots, with the debt, with the death and destruction, on record.
[00:12:45.377 --> 00:12:46.078]  Official U.S.
[00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:46.858]  government policy.
[00:12:46.878 --> 00:12:54.123]  So when you hear the liberals going, we gotta have a carbon tax, it'll fund helping the third world, ask them, go, but we need to get rid of those people, right?
[00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:56.324]  And they'll go, yes, of course.
[00:12:57.105 --> 00:12:57.285]  So,
[00:12:58.683 --> 00:13:01.324]  We have stuff that does have an evil carbon footprint.
[00:13:04.046 --> 00:13:08.548]  We have cotton t-shirts made right here in the USA.
[00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:14.195]  Cotton t-shirts designed and printed up right here in the USA.
[00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:16.835]  The plants do breathe carbon dioxide.
[00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:17.816]  I want to warn people.
[00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:22.097]  The plants that grew this are chemical weapon breathers.
[00:13:22.477 --> 00:13:25.318]  They breathe the deadly devil carbon dioxide.
[00:13:25.778 --> 00:13:29.079]  They even drink the evil devil water.
[00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:31.159]  In fact, put the scientific name of water up on screen.
[00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:32.739]  And try this with your neighbors.
[00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:33.820]  Say, we've got to ban this.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.540]  It's in the water.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.984]  And they'll say, yes, ban it, ban it, your neighbor will be, I'm conscientious, hi, hi.
[00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:40.285]  And then go, but that's water.
[00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:43.649]  And they'll say, still ban the water, ban it all, it's evil.
[00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:45.651]  I mean, this is literally the system.
[00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:51.637]  Dihydrogen monoxide, ladies and gentlemen, hardcore weapon.
[00:13:53.342 --> 00:14:00.587]  So water is a chemical weapon, carbon dioxide that plants breathe is a chemical weapon, and this does have a carbon footprint.
[00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:18.980]  For a limited time, before all this is restricted and banned, and before the factory has to have special licenses to have this, of course there'll be no license on Mexico or China or India, it'll all just leave it there, we'll have to get you charged from there in the future because, you know, carbon footprint, it'll actually increase the carbon footprint though, moving it all to China and India.
[00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:21.042]  In a way it's kind of a good thing, but
[00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:23.087]  Simple as that, we'll lose our jobs.
[00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:24.908]  But I mean, it's a good thing that we'll have more carbon.
[00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:27.449]  Which is actually what plants breathe.
[00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:29.130]  But here are the new t-shirts.
[00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.390]  We got a new t-shirt each week.
[00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:35.093]  And InfoWars.com on the left breast over your heart.
[00:14:35.573 --> 00:14:36.774]  We'll zoom in on that.
[00:14:36.794 --> 00:14:38.454]  InfoWars.com.
[00:14:38.554 --> 00:14:41.296]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:46.419]  And then we've taken the famous bumper sticker and given it some 21st century oomph.
[00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:51.701]  Look at that!
[00:14:53.122 --> 00:14:55.542]  Don't steal the government hates competition.
[00:14:56.082 --> 00:15:00.484]  Infowars.com with a friendly police officer with a billy club.
[00:15:01.404 --> 00:15:03.345]  Now this is a shirt everybody should sport.
[00:15:04.145 --> 00:15:06.886]  And it's got that sporty, cutting-edge, trendy.
[00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:12.447]  There's a lot of folks with green mohawks, you know, wearing these kind of style of shirts, kind of that 50s retro.
[00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:15.668]  Ladies and gentlemen, sport this with a green mohawk.
[00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.649]  Now you're truly styling, huh?
[00:15:18.962 --> 00:15:21.164]  And it has an evil carbon footprint.
[00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:24.726]  Man, I'm evil.
[00:15:24.886 --> 00:15:25.126]  Woo!
[00:15:26.227 --> 00:15:34.333]  I was drinking farm milk the other day, actually from a cow in Georgetown that hadn't been pasteurized or had growth hormone added.
[00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:36.535]  Man, I'm radical!
[00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:38.736]  This show is radical!
[00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:40.578]  Extreme!
[00:15:40.758 --> 00:15:41.598]  Wild!
[00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:45.141]  Okay, now let me get serious here.
[00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:51.408]  Tony Blair, I'm a planet-saving kind of guy.
[00:15:51.428 --> 00:15:55.451]  He's saving us!
[00:15:56.952 --> 00:16:05.998]  I mean, this is a guy who turned England into a police state surveillance grid worse than 1984, with secret police everywhere.
[00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:12.362]  The Wall Street Journal admitted she had secret police interrogating her while she was in England, but still, I'm extreme though.
[00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:16.069]  Just everybody has secret police tell you to line up and answer questions.
[00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:17.530]  That's completely normal.
[00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.031]  The citizens are spies.
[00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:19.711]  Everything's fine.
[00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:21.592]  But that's alright.
[00:16:21.672 --> 00:16:22.232]  Tony Blair.
[00:16:22.712 --> 00:16:27.254]  I'm a planet-saving kind of guy.
[00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:34.197]  And this article with a straight face pushes global carbon taxes.
[00:16:37.486 --> 00:16:38.767]  Don't you want to save the planet?
[00:16:38.787 --> 00:16:46.950]  You know, it's kind of like a cool beatnik at a coffee shop, and it's like, oh, you got a big beard and a bandana, and you've got all the right stuff, and that must mean you're cool.
[00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.270]  What are you doing with your life?
[00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.071]  Oh, man, I'm saving the planet, daddy-o!
[00:16:51.632 --> 00:16:52.332]  Rad!
[00:16:52.592 --> 00:16:53.232]  All right!
[00:16:53.572 --> 00:16:54.973]  Hey, man, great!
[00:16:59.025 --> 00:17:01.326]  Meanwhile, you're stooges for eugenicists.
[00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:15.531]  And again, I don't care if you've got green hair, a mohawk, purple hair, blue hair, I don't care if you're wearing a cowboy hat, I don't care if you're wearing a three-piece suit, can we just get into liberty instead of how we look, or what color the president is, or what color Michael Jackson is?
[00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:28.576]  I saw a clip on the news, maybe the five minutes of news coverage, and it was that actor who played in any given Sunday, Jamie Foxx,
[00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:32.208]  I kind of think he's a good actor, but now I don't like him anymore.
[00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:38.012]  He was up there praising Michael Jackson, the pervert, and going, he's our Michael Jackson.
[00:17:38.032 --> 00:17:39.112]  He's our black man.
[00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:40.954]  It's all about race identity.
[00:17:41.234 --> 00:17:50.000]  Well, if you're so into your fellow black man, how about you, Jamie Foxx, stop the CPS from grabbing black kids and testing chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals on them.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.301]  It's going on right now.
[00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:58.046]  But no, it's too much fun to, you know, make $20 million a year and run around like a pimp, pimping everybody.
[00:17:58.066 --> 00:18:06.048]  Talking about Michael Jackson, who gave kids Jesus juice and his maximum security, uh, that's what he called it, the wine, when he got them drunk.
[00:18:07.308 --> 00:18:11.269]  You know, most of us in college are trying to get the chicks to get drunk and halfway pass out.
[00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:12.549]  Not Michael Jackson.
[00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:20.491]  He's got the little kids in there in his maximum security, uh, maximum security bedroom.
[00:18:25.745 --> 00:18:26.445]  It's unbelievable.
[00:18:30.908 --> 00:18:33.529]  Yeah, I had a maximum security bedroom back there getting the kids drunk.
[00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:35.150]  That's a real nice person, Mr. Fox.
[00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.491]  But see, because it's fad-driven, so it's okay.
[00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:41.653]  And that's all this global warming garbage is.
[00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:45.495]  Is it's another fad, another global scam.
[00:18:45.715 --> 00:18:52.298]  You got Fortune 500, all the media, the chemical companies, the energy companies, the NFL, everything's behind it.
[00:18:52.818 --> 00:18:53.379]  It's real.
[00:18:54.705 --> 00:19:00.793]  I randomly was at a Barnes and Noble this weekend and randomly, I wasn't randomly at the Barnes and Noble, I went there on purpose.
[00:19:01.154 --> 00:19:04.138]  Took my wife to dinner for her birthday and then went over next door to the Barnes and Noble.
[00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:09.285]  And I just randomly closed my eyes and grabbed two magazines.
[00:19:10.219 --> 00:19:20.349]  Both of them are how we gotta have global warming taxes and global warming regulation, and one of them was Atlantic Monthly, how we gotta save the planet with a world government, only the bankers can fix it.
[00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:32.041]  I mean, folks, I can randomly walk into a bookstore, walk over to the magazine rack, close my eyes, spin around, people probably thought I was crazy, spin around and just grab two magazines.
[00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:36.052]  And it's all New World Order propaganda.
[00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.473]  I mean, we are wallowing in it.
[00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:41.595]  We are swimming in it.
[00:19:41.995 --> 00:19:43.496]  We are living in it.
[00:19:43.576 --> 00:19:44.816]  It's all around us.
[00:19:45.197 --> 00:19:46.877]  And most of the public just capitulate.
[00:19:46.897 --> 00:19:48.218]  They go, I'm buying into it.
[00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:49.279]  It's a fad.
[00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:50.239]  Enslave me.
[00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.160]  Bankrupt me.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.220]  I'll lose my job.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.921]  But I'll sure be trendy.
[00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:55.202]  Go green.
[00:19:56.224 --> 00:20:02.007]  All the genetic engineering, the cross-species engineering, the toxic waste dumping in the water supply, the overfishing.
[00:20:02.287 --> 00:20:04.728]  There's a lot of real stuff going on that's a problem.
[00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:09.190]  And the government isn't going to do jack squat about that because they want all that to continue.
[00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:15.633]  The elite believes they've got nanotechnology and they can re-people the earth and they've got all these doomsday vaults built.
[00:20:15.873 --> 00:20:17.334]  They don't care if everything gets destroyed.
[00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:18.294]  That's part of their plan.
[00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:19.635]  They want everything to get wrecked.
[00:20:21.055 --> 00:20:25.338]  No, they want to tax innocuous carbon dioxide, the life-giving gas.
[00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:28.521]  4% of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide.
[00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:28.521]  4%!
[00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:29.722]  That's what plants breathe.
[00:20:31.003 --> 00:20:34.005]  And in many other times in history, it's been as much as 10 to 14%.
[00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:38.469]  It's low.
[00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:39.470]  We need more of it.
[00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:41.311]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:44.033]  Tony Blair, he looks like a con artist.
[00:20:44.094 --> 00:20:50.639]  I mean, if you saw this guy standing around in a park by himself, you would think that he was looking for some lovin' in the bathroom.
[00:20:51.758 --> 00:21:01.603]  I mean, and this is a guy who admittedly does black magic rituals when he was Prime Minister, and everything he does is calculated by his wife, who's a witch.
[00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:06.946]  And folks, this isn't me saying he's a witch, let's throw him in the water and see if he sinks or floats.
[00:21:07.686 --> 00:21:16.351]  If at Google, Tony Blair witchcraft, or his wife, Tony Blair's wife witchcraft, you will see mainstream news, okay?
[00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:19.953]  The point is, this is a delusional scam artist criminal.
[00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:22.779]  And so what does he say?
[00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:25.881]  Oh, I'm a planet-saving kind of guy.
[00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:26.862]  Zoom in on this thug.
[00:21:26.882 --> 00:21:34.947]  When we come back, they're now saying summer is not natural and that there shouldn't be seasons.
[00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:35.607]  I told you.
[00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:36.728]  I told you that was next.
[00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:40.351]  I saw him building up to that, going, winter's too cold, global warming.
[00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:41.551]  Summer's too hot, global heating.
[00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:45.114]  Now it's just, well, kids, don't believe that old crazy man.
[00:21:45.454 --> 00:21:46.795]  His re-education didn't work.
[00:21:47.075 --> 00:21:48.696]  There really is no such thing as seasons.
[00:21:49.277 --> 00:21:50.077]  Really, Mommy?
[00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:50.738]  Yes.
[00:21:52.173 --> 00:22:01.219]  We have just received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:14.729]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement for all GCN listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands.
[00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:16.030]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:22:19.432 --> 00:22:23.753]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:28.855]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:37.797]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:22:38.157 --> 00:22:41.538]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS,
[00:22:41.898 --> 00:22:46.379]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:47.820]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.301]  Call today.
[00:22:51.321 --> 00:22:56.602]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[00:22:57.342 --> 00:23:00.403]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[00:23:01.043 --> 00:23:03.404]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[00:23:03.944 --> 00:23:09.886]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:18.618]  The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:26.609]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package, and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[00:23:27.168 --> 00:23:31.551]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:23:32.672 --> 00:23:36.515]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:23:37.195 --> 00:23:40.478]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[00:23:41.098 --> 00:23:45.682]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:23:46.682 --> 00:23:48.564]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:55.229]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.972]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:58.692 --> 00:24:04.033]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:24:04.553 --> 00:24:10.755]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:12.875]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:15.416]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:25.218]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.401]  That's fascist.
[00:24:28.683 --> 00:24:29.964]  It's not about left or right.
[00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:31.746]  It's about a one world government.
[00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:38.552]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.541]  The Obama Deception.
[00:24:48.962 --> 00:24:50.143]  The people strike back.
[00:24:51.934 --> 00:25:02.022]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:25:02.503 --> 00:25:03.544]  Garden in a Can!

[00:25:22.518 --> 00:25:23.519]  Garden in a Can.

[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.001]  Fresh, healthy, easy.

[00:26:04.587 --> 00:26:11.070]  It's kind of good how they always cut to me right when I get in my chair.
[00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.211]  I can do the radio show like this now.
[00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:20.634]  I can't wait to have carbon taxes and have every facet of my life micromanaged by government-controlled freaks run by offshore banks.
[00:26:21.114 --> 00:26:23.355]  I can't wait to have what's left of industry shut down.
[00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:25.495]  I always wanted to be a slave.
[00:26:25.515 --> 00:26:26.276]  This is fun!
[00:26:26.296 --> 00:26:26.816]  I like it!
[00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:27.616]  I like the government!
[00:26:33.564 --> 00:26:35.165]  That'll definitely be looped on the internet.
[00:26:35.185 --> 00:26:36.245]  That'll be another classic.
[00:26:38.526 --> 00:26:39.567]  I'm actually exhausted.
[00:26:41.768 --> 00:26:43.129]  I'm trying to have a good attitude.
[00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.931]  I'm trying to be nice about all this.
[00:26:49.812 --> 00:26:51.673]  It's just this other piece of news I have.
[00:26:52.953 --> 00:26:56.595]  Let me analyze this first, then I'll get into the others and your calls.
[00:26:58.176 --> 00:26:58.816]  Tony Blair.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.661]  I'm a planet-saving kind of guy.
[00:27:02.741 --> 00:27:05.021]  That's the name of the article, Times of London.
[00:27:05.902 --> 00:27:10.143]  The former Prime Minister has a new green master plan.
[00:27:12.004 --> 00:27:16.765]  It won't mean giving up our energy-rich lifestyle, but it will cost us billions.
[00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:20.587]  Oh, we get to keep the fireplace!
[00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:23.588]  His people are going to come inspect and tax.
[00:27:24.908 --> 00:27:25.908]  And again, zoom in on him.
[00:27:25.928 --> 00:27:27.149]  He is such a nice man.
[00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:50.139]  Now, this is their favorite type of article, and I need to create some type of psychological lexicon to explain all of this, to put it into definitions and terms, but the way the pro-global warming crowd always pushes that we have to have this global tax is by criticizing the politicians that are proposing it.
[00:27:52.355 --> 00:27:54.117]  You go, well, how is that promoting it?
[00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.442]  They know the politicians are incredibly unpopular.
[00:27:57.462 --> 00:27:59.544]  They know the people don't trust them and don't like them.
[00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:02.348]  So the trick is...
[00:28:03.479 --> 00:28:22.514]  They always come out and talk about, yeah, the earth is in trouble, but these politicians, they play the class card, are flying on private jets, and have 8,000 square foot homes like Al Gore, and have huge carbon footprints bigger than the average person.
[00:28:22.554 --> 00:28:29.380]  And so, that's the issue, is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is for the global carbon tax, because he's so conservative.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.982]  But he flies to Sacramento every day from L.A., from Beverly Hills.
[00:28:35.982 --> 00:28:44.105]  And, oh, the Prince Charles is for global taxes, but he still flies around the world.
[00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:48.727]  So now he hologrammed into Austin last year to push for the carbon tax.
[00:28:48.747 --> 00:28:51.968]  So now he appears via hologram to save the Earth.
[00:28:52.828 --> 00:28:57.229]  And so, see, it takes the debate off of... They know the human mind wants a debate.
[00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.529]  The human mind wants a choice.
[00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.430]  The human mind wants to be able to make a choice.
[00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.391]  And so, instead of saying, is global warming man-made?
[00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:07.592]  Is global warming man-made and real?
[00:29:07.992 --> 00:29:21.375]  Is global warming a naturally occurring sun cycle that's being hijacked by a group of scammers that want to micromanage and control all industry and set up a worldwide monopoly under their control?
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.441]  And of course, that's the answer.
[00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:25.342]  So they give you a false choice.
[00:29:25.783 --> 00:29:28.885]  Yes, global warming's real and man-made and very horrible.
[00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:30.406]  We've got to do something about it.
[00:29:30.827 --> 00:29:34.330]  But Tony Blair has too big a carbon footprint and is a hypocrite.
[00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.531]  We've got to cut his carbon allotment.
[00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:42.336]  And then they use class warfare with the public going, yeah, get those rich jet-setters.
[00:29:42.897 --> 00:29:44.918]  You understand how that psychological game works, guys?
[00:29:44.938 --> 00:29:45.539]  Does that make sense?
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.721]  And it's a shake and bake.
[00:29:48.781 --> 00:29:49.881]  It's always the same article.
[00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:52.663]  I've seen this article probably 500 times if I've seen it once.
[00:29:54.744 --> 00:29:57.185]  It says, the silence from Tony Blair.
[00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:00.438]  is so long it's embarrassing.
[00:30:00.558 --> 00:30:02.359]  Ooh, everybody's winning.
[00:30:02.439 --> 00:30:06.483]  See, by getting involved and believing in carbon taxes, you get the rich people.
[00:30:06.863 --> 00:30:07.664]  That's the message.
[00:30:08.004 --> 00:30:09.205]  Yes, we're going to tax everybody.
[00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:09.605]  Don't worry.
[00:30:09.625 --> 00:30:11.046]  We're going to get that rich guy.
[00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:12.587]  Oh, look, he's embarrassed.
[00:30:12.808 --> 00:30:14.749]  We're now getting him with the carbon tax.
[00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:16.070]  We're now teaching him.
[00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.231]  We're now showing him.
[00:30:17.592 --> 00:30:20.414]  Oh, please don't throw me in the briar patch, Tony Blair says.
[00:30:22.215 --> 00:30:23.736]  He has just spent 15 minutes
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:31.121]  Enthusing about his new global report about how technology can help the world to combat global climate change.
[00:30:31.321 --> 00:30:32.042]  That's another lie.
[00:30:32.062 --> 00:30:34.462]  That, oh, this is technological jump forward.
[00:30:34.682 --> 00:30:35.683]  This is new jobs.
[00:30:35.763 --> 00:30:36.203]  No, it's not.
[00:30:36.243 --> 00:30:37.443]  It's freezing the economy.
[00:30:37.663 --> 00:30:39.644]  It's a wet blanket on the already dead economy.
[00:30:40.124 --> 00:30:41.044]  Another lie right there.
[00:30:41.064 --> 00:30:42.624]  It's all just scientifically written.
[00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:45.065]  This Jonathan Leak knows what he's doing.
[00:30:48.447 --> 00:30:56.851]  About how technology can help the world combat climate change, and when the obvious question rose, what has he done to make his own life more sustainable?
[00:30:58.192 --> 00:31:00.073]  Err, long silence?
[00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:03.234]  Oh, he's not doing enough!
[00:31:03.334 --> 00:31:05.115]  See, that's the control paradigm.
[00:31:05.555 --> 00:31:09.137]  Give up everything to the bankers and be a slave, or kill yourself.
[00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:12.061]  Really prove you take one for the team.
[00:31:12.362 --> 00:31:15.886]  Put back on screen, ABC News tells kids to commit suicide.
[00:31:16.306 --> 00:31:17.367]  I'm not kidding when I say that.
[00:31:17.828 --> 00:31:19.089]  Really prove you're for the earth.
[00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.331]  Kill yourself.
[00:31:20.872 --> 00:31:22.554]  Oh, how good of you.
[00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:24.756]  Well, Elitist, why don't you kill yourself?
[00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:26.939]  Oh, we have to oversee the death.
[00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:30.885]  We have to be the guardians of the system.
[00:31:31.385 --> 00:31:32.085]  Tony Blair.
[00:31:32.726 --> 00:31:34.387]  I'm a planet-saving kind of guy.
[00:31:34.407 --> 00:31:40.392]  When we get back, climate change alarmist claims arrival of summer is really global warming.
[00:31:40.992 --> 00:31:41.452]  Oh yes!
[00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:43.034]  We're on the march.
[00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.115]  The empire's on the run.
[00:31:46.056 --> 00:31:48.738]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:56.722]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:31:56.942 --> 00:32:00.747]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:06.555]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:06.855 --> 00:32:07.316]  It's true.
[00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:12.460]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:18.305]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:21.828]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:25.452]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:26.573 --> 00:32:30.176]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:35.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:32:36.141 --> 00:32:40.705]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:40.846 --> 00:32:42.387]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:51.479 --> 00:32:52.580]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.661]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:32:54.861 --> 00:32:55.502]  Well, you should.
[00:32:55.842 --> 00:33:00.084]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:33:00.325 --> 00:33:00.805]  That's right.
[00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:11.031]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:16.555]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol
[00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:25.001]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:33:25.361 --> 00:33:30.585]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:32.046]  This is real.
[00:33:32.366 --> 00:33:33.107]  Don't miss out.

[00:33:53.443 --> 00:33:58.007]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:33:58.187 --> 00:34:00.969]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:04.012]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:34:04.192 --> 00:34:08.896]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:34:09.116 --> 00:34:10.057]  If you simply prepare.
[00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:13.200]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:20.386]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[00:34:20.486 --> 00:34:23.629]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:40.888]  Take action today.
[00:34:40.928 --> 00:34:42.710]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:35:05.822 --> 00:35:21.690]  All right, your phone calls, Craig, Gary, Danny, Bill, Kelly, Michael, they're all coming up.
[00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:23.872]  I'm going to get into the hate crime legislation.
[00:35:24.512 --> 00:35:26.113]  I mean, I can't believe this is happening.
[00:35:26.193 --> 00:35:30.215]  I can't believe the House has passed a bill that says basically no free speech in America.
[00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.063]  I mean, this is like the Soviet Union.
[00:35:33.523 --> 00:35:34.443]  It's really happening.
[00:35:34.523 --> 00:35:35.784]  And I'm not gonna shut up.
[00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:40.685]  And at the point they're trying to send cops around to arrest people for their speech, we gotta do something.
[00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:44.987]  And they always sell it in the name of, oh, it's to shut up a Nazi.
[00:35:45.387 --> 00:35:48.308]  Yeah, but if you shut up a Nazi, you just shut yourself up.
[00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:50.929]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.106]  Punch that up on screen for folks.
[00:35:56.146 --> 00:35:59.229]  I want them to see this at PrisonPlanet.tv and also hear the headline.
[00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:12.722]  When I tell you that Dr. Eric Pianca and it seems like every other major biology professor we look into who's tenured, they're calling for 90% of us to be killed.
[00:36:13.263 --> 00:36:18.668]  This whole thing is about eugenics, about saying that they're the elite and they decide who lives and who dies.
[00:36:20.183 --> 00:36:27.750]  And you can go to ABC News Australia, where they put out a kids video game, teaching kids how to kill themselves.
[00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:28.951]  Punch it up!
[00:36:30.573 --> 00:36:30.973]  There it is.
[00:36:31.073 --> 00:36:33.616]  ABC website tells kids when they should die.
[00:36:34.577 --> 00:36:35.378]  And then punch it up!
[00:36:35.758 --> 00:36:36.919]  Pools of blood.
[00:36:37.379 --> 00:36:44.106]  It teaches them, oh, you have a certain carbon footprint, and when it runs out, you've got to die with pools of blood.
[00:36:48.735 --> 00:36:50.497]  Based on your greenhouse emissions.
[00:36:51.559 --> 00:37:01.692]  Now, that said, I've seen them building towards saying that seasons aren't normal.
[00:37:03.595 --> 00:37:08.036]  Because first it was global, first it was global freezing back in the 60s when we had a cold spell.
[00:37:08.236 --> 00:37:11.417]  They said, oh my God, the Earth's freezing, we've got to have a global tax on carbon dioxide.
[00:37:12.037 --> 00:37:16.118]  Then they said, oh my gosh, in the 70s it's a warming trend, we've got to have a global warming tax.
[00:37:16.778 --> 00:37:21.699]  And then the last few years there's been a global cooling trend and the UN and others have been caught on record.
[00:37:22.059 --> 00:37:24.120]  Steve Watts in this article he wrote has links
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.721]  To the mainstream news admitting it.
[00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:32.466]  Lying about what the buoys in the ocean getting temperature and what weather stations worldwide were showing.
[00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:38.691]  They just lied and added five to ten degrees on every buoy and thermostat in the world they were measuring from.
[00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:39.671]  They're just liars.
[00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:40.592]  They're scam artists.
[00:37:41.172 --> 00:37:43.314]  Enron came up with this carbon tax idea.
[00:37:44.215 --> 00:37:49.338]  This is a tax everything you do and put it into a private derivatives account of a bunch of offshore banks.
[00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:52.421]  So of course all the big corporations are for it.
[00:37:53.374 --> 00:37:53.794]  I don't know.
[00:37:53.814 --> 00:37:55.436]  The NFL came out and said it's real.
[00:37:55.496 --> 00:37:55.956]  I like it.
[00:37:56.176 --> 00:37:57.297]  It's tough and manly.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.181]  You're not against football, are you?
[00:38:01.221 --> 00:38:02.121]  Some kind of commie?
[00:38:02.742 --> 00:38:04.023]  We need home inspections.
[00:38:05.404 --> 00:38:08.207]  We need the kids to learn how to commit suicide.
[00:38:08.647 --> 00:38:09.448]  It's tough.
[00:38:11.009 --> 00:38:13.951]  It's conservative to pay 95% taxes.
[00:38:16.774 --> 00:38:18.215]  Man, I'm really obnoxious today.
[00:38:18.255 --> 00:38:20.517]  I'm just getting sick of everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:21.775 --> 00:38:24.817]  So great story by Steve Watson up on Infowars.net.
[00:38:25.197 --> 00:38:29.801]  Climate change alarmist claims arrival of summer is really global warming.
[00:38:30.461 --> 00:38:34.224]  The same Guardian newspaper that says ban fireworks because they create carbon.
[00:38:36.265 --> 00:38:37.126]  Deadly carbon.
[00:38:39.653 --> 00:38:52.500]  In what amounts a little more than a three-paragraph rant, a well-known British climate change alarmist has announced that the onset of a glorious spell of summer weather has uniformly silenced climate change deniers.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.620]  It's the same every summer.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.281]  They go, notice things are hot.
[00:38:55.441 --> 00:38:56.322]  That's global warming.
[00:38:57.543 --> 00:38:58.963]  And they're saying record heat.
[00:38:59.143 --> 00:39:00.504]  Austin has never been hotter.
[00:39:01.124 --> 00:39:02.665]  I went and looked up the record temperatures.
[00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:04.126]  Austin has been 112 degrees.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:06.720]  Before.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.601]  They're saying 105 is the hottest ever recorded.
[00:39:09.621 --> 00:39:11.862]  In fact, I heard that on the news this morning.
[00:39:12.462 --> 00:39:16.843]  Hey guys, search the term Austin record temperature.
[00:39:17.183 --> 00:39:19.104]  Austin, Texas, record temperature.
[00:39:20.064 --> 00:39:22.005]  We'll see if it's the 105 like they're saying.
[00:39:22.825 --> 00:39:23.425]  In July.
[00:39:23.865 --> 00:39:24.966]  It's been a lot hotter than 105 in July.
[00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:28.932]  But they go, my god, it's hot!
[00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:30.353]  And the kids are like, what is it, mommy?
[00:39:30.433 --> 00:39:32.154]  It's something called global warming.
[00:39:32.174 --> 00:39:34.174]  It used to always be snow on the ground, honey.
[00:39:34.794 --> 00:39:35.575]  Oh, okay, mommy.
[00:39:35.815 --> 00:39:36.495]  How do I fix it?
[00:39:36.935 --> 00:39:45.698]  Well, you pay money to offshore banks to fund eugenics and kill people in third world countries, and then we lose all our jobs here and are dependent on them and we live homeless on the street.
[00:39:46.826 --> 00:39:48.707]  Now, record temperatures seize Austin.
[00:39:49.188 --> 00:39:50.869]  Again, medics warn of heat dangers.
[00:39:51.729 --> 00:39:55.812]  Every year, the local news, there's KI.com, total baloney.
[00:39:56.412 --> 00:39:57.813]  It's not record temperatures!
[00:39:58.394 --> 00:40:01.616]  Now, you got a news item with them saying it's record temperatures.
[00:40:01.976 --> 00:40:03.497]  What I actually saw on TV this morning.
[00:40:04.778 --> 00:40:06.179]  Go, I saw it on News 8.
[00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:09.481]  Go now and put in
[00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:15.272]  Temperature records Austin, Texas, and you'll get federal or state government.
[00:40:15.612 --> 00:40:17.693]  And I guarantee you it's higher than 105.
[00:40:17.933 --> 00:40:20.573]  I want to say it's 112 or 14.
[00:40:21.354 --> 00:40:33.037]  I remember a summer when I was about nine years old in Dallas, when all the grass died, the ground was cracked, the sun was like red every day in the sky, and they were saying it was 110, 114 some days.
[00:40:33.057 --> 00:40:34.117]  And trees were all dying everywhere.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.821]  It's the sun, nothing to do with your SUVs.
[00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:44.961]  Did you find it?
[00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:48.322]  That's monthly averages from the Weather Channel.
[00:40:49.082 --> 00:40:54.083]  Find like Austin record, Austin, Texas record summer temperature.
[00:40:57.063 --> 00:40:59.124]  All time record temperature, Austin, Texas.
[00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:00.404]  Find that.
[00:41:02.284 --> 00:41:03.705]  I know I heard 114 growing up in Dallas.
[00:41:08.188 --> 00:41:22.946]  I remember doing two-a-days for a week straight one time in August when it was 109 degrees, and they still wouldn't cancel the Rockwall Yellow Jackets one, but Dallas was canceling theirs because some of the kids were dying, and our coaches were all
[00:41:24.636 --> 00:41:28.838]  Former Marines from Korea and stuff, they're like, you little bastard, you're gonna run!
[00:41:29.258 --> 00:41:30.459]  Here, let me see what it says here.
[00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:35.421]  Record heat prompts weather advisories, all-time energy consumption.
[00:41:35.681 --> 00:41:41.304]  Now that's a News 8 putting out the local lie, saying 105 is the all-time record heat for July.
[00:41:41.364 --> 00:41:43.445]  That is not true in Texas!
[00:41:45.026 --> 00:41:45.847]  I guarantee it.
[00:41:48.488 --> 00:41:49.568]  See, you're getting current weather.
[00:41:49.628 --> 00:41:52.530]  You want all-time heat record, Austin, Texas.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.262]  Or Heat Records, Texas will get it for you.
[00:41:57.423 --> 00:42:01.566]  See, the reason I do this now on air a lot is it's all about the experience, just learning data.
[00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:06.209]  Here, I'm going to say the news is lying to you about 105 being the record on July 4th.
[00:42:06.989 --> 00:42:10.992]  And so I'm going to go show you now that it's not record temperatures.
[00:42:15.135 --> 00:42:15.836]  The highest is 120.
[00:42:15.876 --> 00:42:16.516]  Yeah, but is that Austin?
[00:42:20.566 --> 00:42:23.208]  San Marcos, 1954, 110.
[00:42:24.249 --> 00:42:25.469]  That's basically Austin.
[00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:27.091]  That's South Austin now, San Marcos.
[00:42:29.192 --> 00:42:31.534]  Okay, there's San Marcos right there.
[00:42:31.554 --> 00:42:31.534]  110, 1954.
[00:42:32.314 --> 00:42:35.076]  You gotta find the date on that.
[00:42:35.677 --> 00:42:39.059]  Find me record temperatures Texas in month of July.
[00:42:39.459 --> 00:42:40.020]  I want that.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.842]  I guarantee it's gonna be over 105 in Austin.
[00:42:43.222 --> 00:42:44.723]  I'll bet my right arm.
[00:42:46.445 --> 00:42:47.245]  Man, I'm obnoxious.
[00:42:47.425 --> 00:42:47.725]  Okay.
[00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:53.687]  Anyways, let me just go ahead and, uh... Anyways.
[00:42:54.907 --> 00:42:55.508]  Here's the article.
[00:42:55.548 --> 00:42:58.588]  Now they're saying basically summer doesn't exist, and they teach kids this in school.
[00:42:58.608 --> 00:43:07.811]  They go, it's hot outside, and the little five-year-olds are like, uh-huh, you're gonna die, and the atmosphere's gonna boil off the planet, and you're all gonna burn to death if we don't have global warming.
[00:43:08.071 --> 00:43:11.052]  Now you go tell mommy, here's a list of carbon crimes,
[00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:13.373]  And of course, they don't tell the five-year-olds that.
[00:43:13.413 --> 00:43:14.494]  They just scare them when they're five.
[00:43:14.514 --> 00:43:23.479]  But by the time they're in the third, fourth grade, they have them with little clipboards going, Mommy, you're getting a ticket from me for the hot bath and you left the light on.
[00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:26.620]  Mommy, you left the water on while you were brushing your teeth.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.561]  That's wasteful.
[00:43:27.901 --> 00:43:31.243]  My grandmother was basically doing that to me at my parents' house.
[00:43:33.684 --> 00:43:34.925]  Fourth of July, Saturday.
[00:43:36.266 --> 00:43:38.207]  God bless her heart, I'm over there and she's like,
[00:43:41.437 --> 00:43:45.300]  Telling me that we shouldn't water our yard, it's a devil crime that water's not renewable.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.742]  I mean, they've got, the body snatchers have got everybody, folks, basically.
[00:43:51.444 --> 00:43:53.465]  Did we find the record temperatures for Austin?
[00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:08.095]  Yeah, well, they're saying a record high temperature of 104 degrees was set in Austin Camp Mabry today, airport weather, July 2009.
[00:44:12.486 --> 00:44:13.666]  I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:44:13.686 --> 00:44:14.447]  We're going to find it.
[00:44:15.347 --> 00:44:16.627]  Anyways, that's yesterday.
[00:44:16.647 --> 00:44:17.827]  That's them saying it's the record.
[00:44:18.828 --> 00:44:25.269]  Okay, Climate Change Alarmist claims arrival of summer is really global warming.
[00:44:25.769 --> 00:44:28.970]  Some people seem to have forgotten what seasons are.
[00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.551]  Now see, Steve Watts has now become a conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:32.591 --> 00:44:34.411]  He's saying there's something called seasons, folks.
[00:44:35.632 --> 00:44:38.372]  I've heard that guy's a wild nut.
[00:44:38.872 --> 00:44:41.213]  The Wall Street Journal ought to write a story about how he's crazy.
[00:44:42.352 --> 00:44:53.577]  In what amounts a little more than a three-paragraph rant, a well-known British climate change alarmist has announced that the onset of the glorious spell of summer weather has uniformly silenced climate change deniers.
[00:44:54.097 --> 00:45:06.702]  London Guardian contributor George Monbiot today asked, by the way, he's a guy that signed a letter a month ago calling for world government with a group of journalists, so he wants the funding mechanism for world government.
[00:45:07.382 --> 00:45:11.384]  Have the climate change deniers abandoned us during the heat wave, is the headline.
[00:45:12.962 --> 00:45:16.004]  Oh, we abandoned... See, they know everybody's about living in the minute.
[00:45:16.024 --> 00:45:17.884]  Everybody's about transitory hype.
[00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:21.526]  And so... Oh, it's hot!
[00:45:21.766 --> 00:45:22.727]  Oh, proven!
[00:45:23.827 --> 00:45:27.509]  That's like saying, it's hot, so therefore, the moon is made of cheese.
[00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:33.992]  It's like having a block of cheese in your hand going, I have cheese, therefore the moon is made of cheese.
[00:45:36.024 --> 00:45:50.775]  His central, and indeed his only, point seems to be that because it is hot at the moment in the southeast of England, this can be used to counter those who question the consensus, of course they lied about there being a consensus, on climate change.
[00:45:52.036 --> 00:45:53.057]  Notice it's not global warming.
[00:45:53.077 --> 00:45:54.398]  See, it's climate change.
[00:45:54.758 --> 00:45:56.300]  Having seasons is evil.
[00:45:58.661 --> 00:45:59.142]  I'm not kidding.
[00:45:59.162 --> 00:46:03.245]  You're going to have children now arguing, going, is it true we have climate?
[00:46:03.725 --> 00:46:05.827]  Is it true there used to be a winter and a summer?
[00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:10.113]  No, those people are with Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:10.894 --> 00:46:13.055]  Climate change deniers, they bombed a building.
[00:46:13.295 --> 00:46:14.096]  Look for that to happen.
[00:46:14.116 --> 00:46:16.537]  They're going to definitely do false flags if they want to ban.
[00:46:17.237 --> 00:46:18.238]  It's called climate denial.
[00:46:18.278 --> 00:46:20.780]  They say that's code now for wanting to kill Jews.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.300]  I'm not kidding.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.081]  They say, you know, use the Holocaust on anybody.
[00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:26.463]  Oh, it's like Holocaust denial.
[00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.124]  We have to arrest you.
[00:46:28.764 --> 00:46:29.665]  They're proposing arrest.
[00:46:29.705 --> 00:46:31.446]  In fact, people won't believe that.
[00:46:31.466 --> 00:46:33.567]  It says 107 close to record.
[00:46:36.513 --> 00:46:37.954]  That's out of the Austin American Statesman.
[00:46:37.994 --> 00:46:40.014]  So June is not as hot as July.
[00:46:40.034 --> 00:46:47.198]  And they're saying 107 is close to the record because it was 108 in June before.
[00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:51.599]  See, I'm telling you, that is not the all-time hot temperature like they're saying right now.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.201]  I've seen it 100 degrees in May in this state.
[00:47:00.788 --> 00:47:02.310]  Again, it's all about perception.
[00:47:02.571 --> 00:47:13.105]  It's kind of like people in New York, everybody I meet from New York who's never been to Texas, they go, we thought you lived in shacks and rode horses to work and we thought that it was all desert.
[00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:16.683]  It's a perception that Texas is desert.
[00:47:17.303 --> 00:47:20.866]  Well, the western part of it is, the eastern part, swamps and pine trees.
[00:47:21.487 --> 00:47:31.755]  But the point is, the perception is global warming's real, and this new global government's gonna fix it, when it has nothing to do with that, and the people pushing it know that.
[00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.116]  It's a big joke to them.
[00:47:34.637 --> 00:47:38.060]  And I know you know that, folks, but we gotta get the word out to people.
[00:47:45.217 --> 00:48:05.520]  Once again, using the insane and extremely derogatory term of denier, for anyone who raises questions over the theory of man-made global warming, Monbiot fires his way through an immature explosion of words that may as well read, told you so, told you so, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:48:06.061 --> 00:48:07.663]  Yeah, but see, he does that scientifically.
[00:48:07.703 --> 00:48:11.166]  Mombiatsa, high-level journalist with The Globalist, he admits it.
[00:48:11.246 --> 00:48:12.347]  He's gone.
[00:48:12.587 --> 00:48:13.608]  We've run our black ops.
[00:48:13.628 --> 00:48:14.329]  They're brain damaged.
[00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:16.711]  They're dumbed down with our eugenics op.
[00:48:17.131 --> 00:48:18.593]  We've got to further dumb them down.
[00:48:19.013 --> 00:48:27.081]  And so they feed people on this bestial, low-level, moronic, sophomoric, ah-ha, you just don't like Obama because you lost, right-winger!
[00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:29.641]  And I'm like, I'm not a Republican or a right-winger.
[00:48:29.661 --> 00:48:31.022]  I don't believe in the left-right paradigm.
[00:48:31.422 --> 00:48:33.184]  The presidents are controlled by offshore banks.
[00:48:33.564 --> 00:48:35.186]  Nice try, Republican!
[00:48:35.486 --> 00:48:36.707]  You just met, you lost!
[00:48:37.227 --> 00:48:38.148]  Nice try!
[00:48:38.468 --> 00:48:39.609]  It's hot outside!
[00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.011]  It's global warming!
[00:48:41.031 --> 00:48:42.512]  Uh-huh!
[00:48:42.812 --> 00:48:45.234]  You're like, hey, you faked all the thermostat records.
[00:48:46.235 --> 00:48:46.936]  No, we didn't!
[00:48:46.996 --> 00:48:47.476]  Shut up!
[00:48:48.037 --> 00:48:48.197]  Uh-huh!
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.261]  And you're like, but you're being enslaved too!
[00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:54.702]  No, I'm part of the system!
[00:48:55.183 --> 00:48:55.363]  Uh-huh!
[00:48:56.647 --> 00:48:58.668]  Because I feel like I'm going along with it psychologically.
[00:48:58.688 --> 00:48:59.769]  That makes me in charge.
[00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:19.479]  The fact that this is the height of summer, and that this is the first time in three years that the country has seen any kind of agreeable weather, seems to be a secondary point for those like Monbiot, who have us believe that we're all going to keel over and die unless we start paying vast amounts of taxes to politicians and carbon trading to businessmen.
[00:49:19.859 --> 00:49:20.699]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.620]  Go to your calls.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.541]  The point here is
[00:49:24.721 --> 00:49:29.524]  Then we have this Oxfam International, big globalist eugenics front.
[00:49:31.225 --> 00:49:37.629]  And it says, millions face climate-related hunger as seasons shift and change.
[00:49:37.669 --> 00:49:39.691]  And it says there's floods and earthquakes.
[00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:41.692]  It's the climate doing it.
[00:49:42.753 --> 00:49:44.134]  There's always floods and earthquakes.
[00:49:45.154 --> 00:49:50.698]  And they show somebody in a flood having to carry his belongings as if
[00:49:53.007 --> 00:49:56.269]  As if monsoons in India didn't happen 5,000 years ago.
[00:49:58.671 --> 00:49:59.471]  But see, no proof.
[00:49:59.511 --> 00:50:02.153]  It's all just emotional appeal to emotion.
[00:50:02.553 --> 00:50:04.934]  Oh, the Earth is dying.
[00:50:05.215 --> 00:50:06.996]  Oh, my God.
[00:50:07.836 --> 00:50:13.900]  If we don't move our industry to India where they have no carbon controls and if we don't increase the carbon, we're all dead.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.181]  But that's not what they're saying.
[00:50:15.201 --> 00:50:18.303]  They're saying move it to India where there's no controls and there'll be less.
[00:50:22.054 --> 00:50:23.215]  Even if you believe it's bad!
[00:50:24.237 --> 00:50:36.290]  And then the next thing is, oh, we need a global tax mobilized for $150 billion tax needed in addition to existing aid commitments to help poor countries adapt to the efforts of climate change and reduce emissions.
[00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.033]  That's just a new IMF World Bank payoff.
[00:50:39.093 --> 00:50:41.216]  It just gave the IMF a trillion dollars.
[00:50:42.677 --> 00:50:49.141]  To go out and forcibly carry out inoculations, injections, sterilizations, takeover of the third world.
[00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:51.142]  It's just funding the war machine.
[00:50:51.442 --> 00:50:52.963]  Oh, we're here to help the Earth!
[00:50:55.405 --> 00:50:57.206]  This is the Nazi takeover.
[00:50:57.286 --> 00:50:58.947]  This is the globalist takeover.
[00:50:59.007 --> 00:51:00.168]  This is the eugenics.
[00:51:00.208 --> 00:51:05.251]  This is the planetary government regulating the very building blocks of life on the planet.
[00:51:05.811 --> 00:51:10.074]  Talk about a tyranny that makes what you breathe a crime.
[00:51:10.885 --> 00:51:13.806]  The air you breathe, what plants breathe, a crime.
[00:51:14.147 --> 00:51:19.509]  It is the most preposterous scam fraud ever conceived, and it's passed the U.S.
[00:51:19.529 --> 00:51:19.929]  House!
[00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:27.473]  It's now in the Senate, and so is the hate crimes bill to ban free speech in America, targeting Christianity.
[00:51:27.973 --> 00:51:29.074]  Christians aren't protected.
[00:51:30.168 --> 00:51:31.369]  Gun owners aren't protected.
[00:51:31.429 --> 00:51:32.489]  Veterans aren't protected.
[00:51:32.529 --> 00:51:41.393]  It's all, if you say something bad about any of these protected groups and it hurts their feelings, the federal government is going to send police to arrest you.
[00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:47.596]  And then we're going to demonize conservatives and gun owners and Christians with the Homeland Security reports.
[00:51:47.816 --> 00:51:48.956]  Because see, we're the threat.
[00:51:49.016 --> 00:51:49.977]  We won't take the chip.
[00:51:50.377 --> 00:51:54.199]  We won't go along with the new global Gaia religion.
[00:51:55.919 --> 00:52:02.041]  Alright, I told you, nothing but open phones the next hour, but for the end of this segment, the next, he called in, he couldn't get in on the regular line.
[00:52:02.341 --> 00:52:08.104]  Daryl Rundus, he's been arrested and fined in feed for preaching on street corners in Dallas.
[00:52:08.144 --> 00:52:08.884]  Not allowed to do that.
[00:52:09.244 --> 00:52:10.224]  Landed in the free home of the brave.
[00:52:10.584 --> 00:52:14.546]  He's got a lawsuit going over that, and the news is like, how dare you stand up for your rights?
[00:52:14.986 --> 00:52:16.407]  But he's here to make an announcement today.
[00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:19.108]  Daryl, what do you think of all the stuff that's happening in the world?
[00:52:19.448 --> 00:52:20.948]  Man, you know what I think?
[00:52:20.968 --> 00:52:24.570]  I think Christians must be blind, stupid, or lazy, or something.
[00:52:25.814 --> 00:52:29.956]  I'm constantly confronting them with all this evidence, clearly, right before their face.
[00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:32.617]  And they just don't seem to get it, Alex.
[00:52:32.697 --> 00:52:36.438]  So I just called up today to give you a word of encouragement.
[00:52:36.518 --> 00:52:39.239]  Alright, well give us that word of encouragement on the other side.
[00:52:40.039 --> 00:52:40.920]  Word-couragement.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.960]  I just invented a new word.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.341]  Alex Jones and the Ebonics Radio Show straight ahead.
[00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:47.102]  Darrell Rundas, stay with us, my friend.
[00:52:47.142 --> 00:52:47.862]  Good to hear from you.
[00:52:48.002 --> 00:52:49.723]  We'll be right back with Darrell Rundas and your calls.
[00:52:51.977 --> 00:52:57.001]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[00:52:57.322 --> 00:53:01.345]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[00:53:01.915 --> 00:53:02.615]  I think so.
[00:53:24.424 --> 00:53:32.666]  New Rev has been the subject of some of the most exciting anti-aging research in decades and has only recently become available in purified form.
[00:53:32.986 --> 00:53:36.907]  Now, you can discover the amazing health benefits of New Rev for free.
[00:53:37.227 --> 00:53:38.907]  Just pay to have New Rev shipped to you.

[00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:50.750]  Improve your life today.
[00:53:51.533 --> 00:53:52.874]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:53.034 --> 00:53:58.018]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:53:58.419 --> 00:54:00.500]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:54:00.841 --> 00:54:10.048]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[00:54:10.328 --> 00:54:17.073]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[00:54:17.393 --> 00:54:23.537]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[00:54:23.717 --> 00:54:27.780]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.201]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.

[00:54:38.427 --> 00:54:39.868]  Reduce your payments by up to 60%
[00:54:40.148 --> 00:54:40.529]  We're good.
[00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:59.737]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:55:00.037 --> 00:55:05.720]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:12.565]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:55:13.129 --> 00:55:16.410]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.771]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:55:25.573 --> 00:55:28.874]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[00:55:36.136 --> 00:55:39.098]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[00:55:39.298 --> 00:55:41.380]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.862]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[00:55:45.162 --> 00:55:50.186]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[00:55:57.231 --> 00:55:58.372]  This is the end.
[00:55:59.032 --> 00:55:59.853]  This is the end.
[00:55:59.953 --> 00:56:01.894]  It's hot outside.
[00:56:01.934 --> 00:56:03.215]  The earth is heating.
[00:56:03.335 --> 00:56:03.956]  Tax us!
[00:56:05.157 --> 00:56:08.438]  I heard a conspiracy theorist say it was summer, but that was a lie!
[00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:10.599]  The government teaches us there is no summer!
[00:56:11.479 --> 00:56:14.720]  If the winter comes or the spring comes, it's Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:15.640]  Tax me!
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.421]  Tax me!
[00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:18.261]  The sun has nothing to do with it!
[00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:19.501]  Al Gore says so!
[00:56:19.541 --> 00:56:20.422]  He invented the internet!
[00:56:20.442 --> 00:56:21.182]  He's a genius!
[00:56:21.202 --> 00:56:23.963]  Alright, Dale Rundis.
[00:56:25.043 --> 00:56:26.364]  You were calling into the show.
[00:56:26.404 --> 00:56:26.984]  I apologize.
[00:56:27.004 --> 00:56:27.384]  Go ahead.
[00:56:27.824 --> 00:56:28.624]  That's okay, man.
[00:56:28.724 --> 00:56:32.165]  I just called because it seemed like you could use a word of encouragement.
[00:56:32.205 --> 00:56:33.786]  I know it gets frustrating fighting.
[00:56:34.777 --> 00:56:36.598]  I am a bit of a pouty pot today.
[00:56:36.838 --> 00:56:37.458]  No, it's okay.
[00:56:37.478 --> 00:56:43.760]  In fact, it brings me to my point, which is the number one rule, the very first rule when it comes to waking people up.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.340]  You know what it is?
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:45.580]  Be obnoxious.
[00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:51.062]  Yeah, that too.
[00:56:51.542 --> 00:56:52.982]  No, actually, quite the contrary.
[00:56:53.082 --> 00:56:54.943]  You never get mad at the blind man.
[00:56:55.283 --> 00:56:56.323]  You remember we talked about this?
[00:56:57.424 --> 00:57:01.425]  It's so hard not to because some of these people just seem so arrogant or ignorant.
[00:57:03.106 --> 00:57:05.008]  Yes, they're arrogant about their stupidity.
[00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.229]  It's like they have a possession.
[00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:07.650]  No, I don't want to know that.
[00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:09.531]  There is no such thing as summer.
[00:57:09.591 --> 00:57:09.952]  Shut up.
[00:57:10.032 --> 00:57:10.872]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:57:11.173 --> 00:57:19.740]  And in the same way, though, if you're sitting at a bus stop and a blind man walked by and he tripped over you and fell down, you wouldn't say, hey, you stupid blind man, watch where you're going.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.661]  No, you'd take compassion on him.
[00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:23.563]  No, you'd take him to a FEMA camp as Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:25.592 --> 00:57:27.853]  He's euthanizing because he's bad for the earth.
[00:57:28.173 --> 00:57:29.373]  He's got a carbon footprint.
[00:57:29.714 --> 00:57:30.294]  Absolutely.
[00:57:30.314 --> 00:57:32.455]  But that's where, you know, we have to be patient.
[00:57:32.475 --> 00:57:36.256]  We have to be diligent and persistent in our efforts.
[00:57:36.356 --> 00:57:44.379]  But at the same time, hey, you know, it's our job to do what you're already doing, and that is just continue to sow the truth, the seeds of truth to people.
[00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:46.400]  And hey, let them fall where they may.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.681]  Some will find good soil and they'll produce good fruit.
[00:57:48.901 --> 00:57:49.681]  Most of them won't.
[00:57:50.296 --> 00:57:55.889]  In fact, I wanted to call to give a wake-up call and a word of encouragement to you, but a wake-up call to many Christians.
[00:57:56.289 --> 00:57:57.252]  I heard you reading the word.
[00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:03.212]  Uh, one of the poems the other day, and so I thought of you when I saw this in the scripture, I thought you'd want to hear it.
[00:58:03.232 --> 00:58:03.672]  You want to hear it?
[00:58:04.293 --> 00:58:04.673]  Oh yes.
[00:58:05.073 --> 00:58:09.915]  Yeah, this is Jesus, straight from the Lord himself in Luke 12, talking about the last day.
[00:58:10.275 --> 00:58:12.356]  No way, this is going to be banned soon.
[00:58:12.776 --> 00:58:13.416]  I'm not kidding.
[00:58:13.476 --> 00:58:20.139]  Under the new hate crime law about to pass the Senate, give what you're about to read hurts someone's feelings, and in Canada they arrest preachers.
[00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:21.939]  This is really, actually it happened in Philadelphia.
[00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:23.200]  They arrested preachers.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:30.147]  What you're about to read here is soon to be banned in the U.S., but I guess that's what the 4th of July is all about.
[00:58:31.027 --> 00:58:32.629]  Before this is banned, go ahead and read it.
[00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:35.192]  Yeah, I would say it's no longer independent.
[00:58:35.372 --> 00:58:37.074]  It's more like interdependent.
[00:58:37.134 --> 00:58:38.035]  Dependent on the government.
[00:58:38.335 --> 00:58:39.436]  Yes, dependent on the government.
[00:58:39.756 --> 00:58:40.497]  Go ahead and read.
[00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:41.939]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:58:42.039 --> 00:58:42.940]  Soon to be banned.
[00:58:45.339 --> 00:58:46.860]  Um, evil, according to the Bible.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:59.427]  It definitely would classify for hate speech, but I'm quoting the Bible, the age-old truth of the Scriptures, and this is, once again, Jesus Himself saying this, not to the unbeliever, okay, but to those who say they believe, okay?
[00:58:59.787 --> 00:59:03.349]  So listen close to what He says in Luke 12, starting with verse 42.
[00:59:03.909 --> 00:59:12.354]  He says, Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the Master puts in charge of all His servants, to give them their food allowance at the proper time?
[00:59:12.879 --> 00:59:17.000]  It'll be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
[00:59:17.621 --> 00:59:20.542]  I tell you the truth, he'll put him in charge of all his possessions.
[00:59:21.122 --> 00:59:31.265]  But suppose the servant says to himself, my master is taking a long time in coming, and then he begins to be some other men's servant, the maid's servant, and to eat and drink and get drunk.
[00:59:31.686 --> 00:59:38.748]  Now listen closely to what Jesus says he's going to do to those people who are mocking and making fun of those who are standing up for liberty and truth and for justice.
[00:59:39.292 --> 00:59:45.181]  It says the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect them and at an hour he's unaware of.
[00:59:45.601 --> 00:59:50.048]  And he'll cut him into pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
[00:59:50.695 --> 00:59:58.583]  That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready, or does not do what the master wants, will be beaten with many blows.
[00:59:59.064 --> 01:00:04.509]  But the one who does not know and does things deserving of punishment will be beaten with but a few blows.
[01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:07.212]  So it's a whole lot worse to know... Stay there, Darryl.
[01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:07.813]  Stay there, Darryl.
[01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:08.934]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:00:09.615 --> 01:00:10.456]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:00:11.536 --> 01:00:12.657]  In fact, people don't believe this.
[01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:21.402]  Google pastors arrested Philadelphia for preaching and charges hate criminals because they said that the anti-abortion message was hurtful.
[01:00:22.182 --> 01:00:23.123]  This is on a street corner.
[01:00:23.723 --> 01:00:27.586]  And then also in Canada they are arresting people that read from the Old and New Testament.
[01:00:27.946 --> 01:00:30.427]  So we're going to continue to commit crimes in one minute.
[01:00:30.447 --> 01:00:30.888]  Stay with us.

[01:01:44.515 --> 01:01:46.436]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:01:46.897 --> 01:01:49.699]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:21.754]  All right, my friends, we are now into the final hour already of this transmission.
[01:02:21.774 --> 01:02:24.476]  I do want to get into the whole hate crime legislation.
[01:02:24.496 --> 01:02:26.939]  I've read the subsections over and over again for y'all here.
[01:02:28.721 --> 01:02:29.882]  I can't believe this is in there.
[01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:31.182]  I can't believe this is happening.
[01:02:31.863 --> 01:02:36.285]  And I do want to take your phone calls in the next segment before I get into all of that for those who have been patiently holding.
[01:02:36.565 --> 01:02:39.146]  But Daryl Rhondas got interrupted by the satellite break there.
[01:02:40.027 --> 01:02:42.928]  So Daryl, you were explaining that parable there given by Christ.
[01:02:44.649 --> 01:03:11.340]  uh... about uh... you know this test that is this life what's gonna happen to people that use their stewardship and their knowledge to abuse the lesser people and also like the story of better to tie a millstone around your neck and you hurt one of these and i see that not just as physical children but also is like a retarded children or special needs type people or the old you know how the elite how how the predators love to feed on the weak
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.222]  They are certainly going to be punished for that.
[01:03:16.023 --> 01:03:16.623]  Absolutely.
[01:03:16.863 --> 01:03:30.733]  In fact, what this scripture that I just read to you in Luke 12 says clearly, though, is those who don't know, in other words, those that don't know Him, and they don't live for Him, they serve Satan and not God, they hate God, therefore they love death.
[01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:36.737]  Those people are in less trouble with Jesus when He returns than those who call themselves believers.
[01:03:36.757 --> 01:03:39.639]  Keep in mind, He's not addressing this to the unbelievers.
[01:03:39.719 --> 01:03:41.560]  He says He's going to find these people
[01:03:42.173 --> 01:03:43.074]  With the unbelievers.
[01:03:43.294 --> 01:03:44.756]  So he's talking about believers here.
[01:03:44.776 --> 01:03:58.230]  He's saying, hey, if that wicked, lazy servant doesn't get up and get out and do the Master's will, which is to stand up for peace and truth and liberty and justice and what's right and what's good, he's going to cut them into many pieces and give them many blows.
[01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:02.374]  They're going to be assigned a place with the unbelievers, only they're going to be tortured even worse.
[01:04:02.659 --> 01:04:10.768]  Well what about all these Christians that are saying war and death and all of this stuff is a good thing and even killing people's kids in front of them.
[01:04:11.249 --> 01:04:12.611]  Suddenly that's a good thing.
[01:04:12.671 --> 01:04:15.594]  Suddenly carpet bombing cities is a good thing.
[01:04:16.635 --> 01:04:19.999]  Suddenly corruption and lying about WMDs is a good thing.
[01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.052]  These aren't really Christians.
[01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:24.173]  No, absolutely not, and that's what's sad.
[01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:44.843]  In fact, I'm going to quit calling myself a Christian and start calling myself a Christ follower or something, because so many people claim to be a Christian, and they may serve Him with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him, because I don't know anybody who could love righteousness, who could be a light of the world, and yet allow all these evilties that are done in darkness and never expose them, or even worse,
[01:04:45.353 --> 01:04:45.713]  I think so.
[01:05:06.786 --> 01:05:07.626]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:09.007]  They don't even want to know, Daryl.
[01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:13.528]  They get into being ignorant, and their religion is being ignorant.
[01:05:13.928 --> 01:05:17.449]  And you can give them mainstream news about the preachers covertly hired by FEMA.
[01:05:17.969 --> 01:05:20.309]  FEMA saying they're getting ready for forced inoculations.
[01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:23.310]  I don't know if they're going to do it, but they're certainly saying they're getting ready.
[01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.791]  Homeland Security doing drills with foreign troops.
[01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:27.231]  And they just laugh.
[01:05:27.651 --> 01:05:28.712]  So they're the kooks.
[01:05:28.772 --> 01:05:30.512]  It's their religion to laugh at us.
[01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:31.452]  Absolutely.
[01:05:31.492 --> 01:05:33.713]  And what's even more wicked about it is that
[01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:36.379]  Here they say, oh, it's all going to happen anyway.
[01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:37.700]  There's nothing I can do.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.861]  God's in control, so I'm just going to pray.
[01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:50.106]  And I ask them, look, if a tsunami was about to sweep across the land and wipe out thousands of people, and you knew it was coming, would you just sit there and say, well, God's in control, I'll just stand here and pray?
[01:05:50.286 --> 01:05:51.847]  Or would you run around warning people?
[01:05:52.427 --> 01:05:56.009]  And that would just say, I actually got Christians to say, no, I would just pray.
[01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:57.670]  Let the media tell them about the tsunami.
[01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:58.370]  That's their job.
[01:05:59.045 --> 01:06:00.246]  And I just find it very sad.
[01:06:00.266 --> 01:06:07.730]  In fact, it reminds me of another scripture, and it also reminds me of you in 2 Thessalonians 2, verses 9-12.
[01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:10.772]  It reminds me of people drinking the Kool-Aid, as you call it.
[01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:11.072]  It says,
[01:06:18.636 --> 01:06:19.036]  We're good to go.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.300]  And they do.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.021]  They buy the lie.
[01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.061]  They love the lie, don't they?
[01:06:34.441 --> 01:06:34.922]  Exactly.
[01:06:34.962 --> 01:06:38.403]  This entire New World Order system is openly coming out in the open.
[01:06:38.423 --> 01:06:40.244]  It's the best time ever to wake people up.
[01:06:40.644 --> 01:06:43.426]  And the Christians look at their watch and go, I'm about to get raptured.
[01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.367]  I'm glad things are getting bad.
[01:06:45.447 --> 01:06:46.587]  I'm not going to help anybody.
[01:06:46.948 --> 01:06:49.769]  Do you really think God's going to save you then if you have that attitude?
[01:06:50.009 --> 01:06:51.370]  Daryl, stay there one more minute.
[01:06:52.278 --> 01:06:56.281]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:06:56.522 --> 01:06:58.303]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:06:58.523 --> 01:07:06.810]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:07:07.051 --> 01:07:12.295]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:14.217]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:07:14.457 --> 01:07:20.779]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:07:20.979 --> 01:07:31.723]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:07:32.024 --> 01:07:32.524]  That's right.
[01:07:32.804 --> 01:07:35.085]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:07:35.365 --> 01:07:36.945]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:07:38.886 --> 01:07:39.507]  We're good to go.
[01:07:52.315 --> 01:07:57.858]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:07:58.158 --> 01:07:59.339]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:03.441]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:08:03.742 --> 01:08:05.303]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:11.906]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:15.588]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:17.389]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:20.430]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:22.091]  And their formula really works.
[01:08:22.371 --> 01:08:24.912]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:08:25.192 --> 01:08:26.453]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:08:26.693 --> 01:08:31.075]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:33.656]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:08:33.856 --> 01:08:36.137]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:08:36.337 --> 01:08:38.078]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:08:38.418 --> 01:08:39.999]  Go to www.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.762]  We're good to go.
[01:08:52.642 --> 01:08:55.123]  Mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:08:55.303 --> 01:08:59.384]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:08:59.544 --> 01:09:10.987]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:09:11.207 --> 01:09:17.048]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:09:17.108 --> 01:09:17.468]  I think so.
[01:09:41.068 --> 01:09:51.094]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A, silver.com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338, and help us win this battle.
[01:09:52.015 --> 01:09:59.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:25.666]  Okay, finishing up with Daryl Rundis and then we're going to go on to your phone calls here and a bunch of other things.
[01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:30.191]  Daryl, you were talking about your Facebook.
[01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:32.012]  Fire that out for folks that want to find it.
[01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:34.373]  And also, when are you going to launch this website?
[01:10:34.393 --> 01:10:39.476]  So I'm going to have you on to talk about the new... Yeah, we're looking at T-minus 24 days.
[01:10:39.656 --> 01:10:42.697]  So we're ready to go with YouDo News at the end of July.
[01:10:43.177 --> 01:10:44.118]  And we're really excited about it.
[01:10:44.138 --> 01:10:55.023]  We've had some tremendous breakthroughs syncing up all the CDNs and making sure that it's going to be hacker-proof and it's going to be able to handle the bandwidth that we're going to need to stream all those videos.
[01:10:56.564 --> 01:10:57.805]  Well, I'm excited to push it.
[01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.127]  YouDoNews.com.
[01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:00.208]  Very, very exciting, Darrell.
[01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:04.133]  Yeah, in fact, I want to finish this last scripture because, once again, it's very telling.
[01:11:04.233 --> 01:11:05.414]  And I'm going to go back to verse 11.
[01:11:05.474 --> 01:11:09.279]  It says, for this... Well, start over, because some stations don't carry that last five minutes.
[01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:09.800]  Okay.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:16.888]  Well, it says, the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of faith displayed in all kinds of counterfeit, miracle times and wonders.
[01:11:17.603 --> 01:11:18.784]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:11:18.844 --> 01:11:22.906]  I mean, there's a lot of people out there who call themselves Christians, but they're
[01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:46.905]  You know, they're buying the lie.
[01:11:46.965 --> 01:11:48.386]  They delight in the wickedness.
[01:11:48.486 --> 01:11:54.428]  They're not believing that child protective services, you know, will show up and take your kids without any warrant, without any notice.
[01:11:54.468 --> 01:12:01.290]  That, you know, the cap-and-tack, or they should call it the cap-and-control bill, you know, is being passed even as we speak.
[01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:05.671]  The hate crimes legislation, the cyberbullying bill, all these things are designed
[01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:10.334]  I'm just going to go to your calls for the rest of the show and hit a few important news items here.
[01:12:32.116 --> 01:12:33.517]  It's almost like running in place.
[01:12:33.597 --> 01:12:36.078]  I know we're having a big effect and we're reaching a lot of people.
[01:12:37.859 --> 01:12:39.540]  But it's almost like ridiculous.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.362]  I've got to beg and plead and document and show people.
[01:12:43.722 --> 01:12:46.243]  I mean, there's openly a world government being set up.
[01:12:46.263 --> 01:12:48.385]  They're openly robbing and stealing everything.
[01:12:48.685 --> 01:12:50.646]  They're involved in every corruption you can imagine.
[01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.627]  They've been caught lying millions of times.
[01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:57.329]  And a lot of people are waking up and getting involved, but a lot of other people aren't.
[01:12:57.349 --> 01:12:58.290]  They're fighting us.
[01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:00.511]  And it's because the New World Order
[01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:05.438]  Joseph Goebbels said good propaganda just speaks to people's laziness.
[01:13:06.078 --> 01:13:08.659]  They speak to what people want to hear and want to believe.
[01:13:10.139 --> 01:13:11.679]  And people want to believe everything's fine.
[01:13:11.699 --> 01:13:12.959]  They want to believe their government's good.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.000]  They want to believe everything's... I mean, it's upsetting to know they're criminal.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.701]  It's upsetting to know it's out of control.
[01:13:21.101 --> 01:13:23.622]  It's very disconcerting to know
[01:13:25.805 --> 01:13:37.694]  That the media hypes up abuses by terrorists or political groups they don't like, but doesn't hype up, they're grabbing people to put them in prison, kidnapping people's kids.
[01:13:38.034 --> 01:13:41.217]  People take it that their kids were taken for no reason, like it's no big deal.
[01:13:41.237 --> 01:13:45.380]  I mean, our very survival instincts have been drummed out of us.
[01:13:51.656 --> 01:13:52.857]  It's just outrageous.
[01:13:52.917 --> 01:14:04.505]  If we're already putting up with this, and the establishment is just full steam ahead, coming after our liberties, I mean, how bad is it going to get?
[01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:10.509]  And Thomas Jefferson said tyranny will be as bad as you let it become.
[01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:14.111]  That's paraphrasing.
[01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:18.734]  The level of tyranny you will live under will be the exact amount you basically accept and put up with.
[01:14:21.579 --> 01:14:23.381]  And people think the economy's bad now.
[01:14:23.401 --> 01:14:28.286]  600,000 people on average losing their jobs every month, month after month.
[01:14:28.866 --> 01:14:32.330]  You think the economy's bad now with California going into default and collapsing?
[01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:35.433]  This is the beginning, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:36.294 --> 01:14:39.277]  And it's horrible to see society falling apart.
[01:14:39.857 --> 01:14:45.503]  And then the so-called safety net is really like a big bug zapper to fry everybody.
[01:14:48.524 --> 01:14:49.485]  All right, let's go to the calls.
[01:14:50.065 --> 01:14:51.406]  Gary and Mash, you're on the air.
[01:14:52.186 --> 01:14:53.367]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:54.688]  Good, thanks for holding, Gary.
[01:14:54.728 --> 01:14:55.028]  Welcome.
[01:14:55.668 --> 01:14:57.109]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[01:14:57.189 --> 01:15:00.431]  It was quite a long hold, and I did some research while I was holding.
[01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:05.614]  I want to cover a couple topics, and if we could have a little bit of an interactive dialogue, I'd really appreciate it.
[01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:06.134]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:15:06.154 --> 01:15:07.675]  Okay, first topic.
[01:15:07.955 --> 01:15:13.959]  On July 4th, the SyFy Channel ran 42 episodes of The Twilight Zone.
[01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:19.522]  And one of the episodes, not that I watched them all, I only caught one episode, but it was amazing.
[01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:21.324]  It was called The Obsolete Man.
[01:15:21.364 --> 01:15:22.025]  Have you heard of that?
[01:15:23.426 --> 01:15:23.907]  Say it again?
[01:15:23.927 --> 01:15:29.473]  Okay, it's called The Obsolete Man, and the star of the show was Burgess Meredith.
[01:15:30.711 --> 01:15:32.493]  1961, June 2nd, 1961.
[01:15:32.893 --> 01:15:35.655]  No, I've played the obsolete man here before.
[01:15:35.795 --> 01:15:37.976]  It's a socialist, communist society.
[01:15:38.376 --> 01:15:42.399]  They call him in and they go, you are obsolete as a librarian.
[01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:53.366]  And then basically he shows the whole guy up by wanting his execution to be on television and shows what a coward the state was and so they remove him as well.
[01:15:54.358 --> 01:16:08.945]  Exactly, and the guy who was in charge of the state, who he locked in the room with him, the librarian starts reading from the Bible, Psalm 23, Psalm 53, and the guy from the state's just sitting there getting more and more nervous, his leg is shaking, he starts smoking, and finally he bites his lip.
[01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:09.805]  What's his name?
[01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.486]  He goes, Mr... Whatever his name is.
[01:16:12.506 --> 01:16:14.687]  Now pull up the twilight zone.
[01:16:14.707 --> 01:16:18.249]  Mr. Wordsworth was the... Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:16:19.136 --> 01:16:22.438]  You are obsolete!
[01:16:23.238 --> 01:16:28.921]  He's like getting on, yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up The Obsolete Man, Twilight Zone, and we'll play a clip of that.
[01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.902]  Okay, you want to have a dialogue, but go ahead.
[01:16:30.922 --> 01:16:31.882]  Yes, I've seen the episode.
[01:16:32.402 --> 01:16:35.744]  Yeah, he says, in the name of God, let me out of here!
[01:16:36.464 --> 01:16:41.647]  And right then, Wordsworth obliges, lets the guy in charge of the state out of the room.
[01:16:42.187 --> 01:16:47.810]  Wordsworth himself gets all blown up and killed, but then when the chancellor gets back into the state,
[01:16:48.445 --> 01:16:54.468]  All of the people strip him of his power because one of their big laws was God doesn't exist.
[01:16:55.009 --> 01:17:01.252]  And because he asked for God's help to get out of that room before it blew up, he himself was named a criminal.
[01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:07.535]  Which, ladies and gentlemen, this has happened in hundreds of other countries.
[01:17:07.675 --> 01:17:12.618]  As soon as they pass a hate crime bill, the Soviet Union invented this 80 years ago.
[01:17:13.937 --> 01:17:14.338]  80 plus.
[01:17:14.899 --> 01:17:20.087]  As soon as they do this hate crime, hate speech, this has all been done in the Soviet Union.
[01:17:21.049 --> 01:17:26.578]  As soon as they get rid of the Bill of Rights, as soon as they start violating free speech, it's all gone.
[01:17:27.335 --> 01:17:29.836]  You know, now a lot of cities don't even give you a free speech zone.
[01:17:29.876 --> 01:17:31.256]  They just say protest or ban.
[01:17:31.936 --> 01:17:33.597]  And then now, oh, you can't write that.
[01:17:33.637 --> 01:17:34.417]  You can't say that.
[01:17:34.457 --> 01:17:35.938]  I mean, it's in the New York Times.
[01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.518]  It's in the Washington Post.
[01:17:37.898 --> 01:17:39.859]  Calling for restrictions on free speech.
[01:17:40.539 --> 01:17:47.381]  The CEO of News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's head guy, said arrest bloggers last week.
[01:17:49.102 --> 01:17:53.423]  And, yeah, it's a great point you make.
[01:17:54.364 --> 01:17:55.084]  Your other point was?
[01:17:55.618 --> 01:17:56.699]  Yeah, other point.
[01:17:56.799 --> 01:17:59.841]  I think that your frustration, we share your frustration.
[01:18:00.562 --> 01:18:02.003]  We need to have an action plan.
[01:18:02.043 --> 01:18:03.284]  I want to propose a few things.
[01:18:03.785 --> 01:18:18.356]  Get some more actors and actresses on your show as much as possible because our dumbed down, floor-eyed drinking society needs to hear from those that they look up to that you are for real, that this thing is happening, and that we've got to do something to stop it.
[01:18:18.877 --> 01:18:19.337]  Number one.
[01:18:19.817 --> 01:18:20.318]  Number two.
[01:18:21.192 --> 01:18:24.314]  Get some uncorruptibles out there running for Congress.
[01:18:24.354 --> 01:18:27.275]  Let's find out who they are, starting with our friend Ron Paul.
[01:18:27.535 --> 01:18:28.616]  Who does Ron Paul like?
[01:18:28.976 --> 01:18:35.820]  Because whoever he likes... Well, the minute you have an uncorruptible, that's when the COINTELPRO comes out and says, oh, that's the government agent.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.860]  It's Ron Paul.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.501]  If we just get rid of him, the whole world will be saved.
[01:18:39.822 --> 01:18:41.783]  And Alex Jones, he's the bad one.
[01:18:41.823 --> 01:18:45.925]  Ron Paul's bad, and Alex Jones is, but David Rockefeller, he's not bad.
[01:18:47.892 --> 01:18:50.014]  That's basically what we hear constantly.
[01:18:50.694 --> 01:18:52.775]  Anybody who stands up to corruption, that's them!
[01:18:53.075 --> 01:18:53.896]  They're the government!
[01:18:53.936 --> 01:18:54.356]  Get him!
[01:18:54.676 --> 01:18:55.117]  Get him!
[01:18:55.137 --> 01:19:04.703]  Alex, you've got to get your DVDs out to the military and the police, because if their eyes open, if they wake up, if they get unplugged from the Matrix, they're going to join us.
[01:19:05.023 --> 01:19:09.165]  That's the quickest, best solution right there, and I heartily agree with you.
[01:19:09.185 --> 01:19:14.469]  And when Mark Dice had the idea to mail my films, Terror Storm and others, to the troops, which people did,
[01:19:16.133 --> 01:19:20.619]  Uh, Michael Reagan called for his murder and said, I will pay for his assassination.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.083]  Called for, contracted for murder.
[01:19:23.523 --> 01:19:26.928]  And the FBI said, you're allowed to contract for murder against 9-11 truthers.
[01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:29.391]  Craziness.
[01:19:29.572 --> 01:19:31.074]  Alex, one other thing I want to cover quick.
[01:19:31.613 --> 01:19:33.594]  And I know you've got other callers waiting, I'll make it quick.
[01:19:34.374 --> 01:19:43.338]  It's amazing what's going on with Chemtrails, because first off, I think for the 4th of July they did us a favor, and for one week they stopped Chemtrailing Boston, so the fireworks were great.
[01:19:44.178 --> 01:19:45.318]  Oh, that was nice of them.
[01:19:45.558 --> 01:19:46.599]  That was nice of them, I know.
[01:19:46.659 --> 01:19:46.899]  See?
[01:19:47.059 --> 01:19:48.820]  Don't say the government didn't do something for you.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.881]  Government's got a couple websites that are up now, they'll probably go away soon.
[01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:57.223]  I am shocked at how much data they're releasing on these programs that we all thought were top secret.
[01:19:57.948 --> 01:20:00.049]  ASP.BNL.GOV.
[01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:01.510]  Grab every file you can.
[01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.731]  ASP.BNL.GOV.
[01:20:04.691 --> 01:20:05.051]  Hold on.
[01:20:06.272 --> 01:20:08.833]  ASP.BNL.COM?
[01:20:09.353 --> 01:20:10.413]  It's ASP.BNL.GOV.
[01:20:10.513 --> 01:20:11.574]  It's all up there right now.
[01:20:12.025 --> 01:20:22.088]  Oh yeah, we just... Oh yeah, atmospheric science program, science team meeting, climate change science program synthesis, and assessment report for aerosols released.
[01:20:22.848 --> 01:20:25.369]  It's almost like space aliens control the planet.
[01:20:26.129 --> 01:20:30.110]  I'm saying this hypothetically, and they come on the news and go, the Earth is dying!
[01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:32.311]  We must make the atmosphere methane!
[01:20:32.331 --> 01:20:33.871]  And then you see, like, their gills.
[01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:35.332]  We breathe methane!
[01:20:35.672 --> 01:20:36.352]  So do you!
[01:20:36.412 --> 01:20:38.133]  We are from planet Google Gob!
[01:20:38.153 --> 01:20:39.153]  I mean, you know...
[01:20:39.713 --> 01:20:42.738]  They're like, we must change the atmosphere or the Earth will die!
[01:20:42.758 --> 01:20:47.025]  And they're teaching kids, the atmosphere is off-gassing into space!
[01:20:47.365 --> 01:20:48.867]  You'll soon boil alive!
[01:20:49.188 --> 01:20:53.334]  Unless we spray barium salt and aluminum dioxide on you!
[01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:57.633]  One last thing, you're always saying Google it.
[01:20:58.094 --> 01:21:02.438]  Try to say Dogpilot or something else, because Google's on the inside of their program now.
[01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:07.884]  Let's find some other search engines we can trust, because at some point, everything we do through Google's going to be cracked.
[01:21:07.964 --> 01:21:11.008]  Certainly, I know Google was set up by the CIA, is the government.
[01:21:11.048 --> 01:21:12.329]  It's the best search engine out there.
[01:21:12.369 --> 01:21:15.372]  I've found people know what Google means.
[01:21:16.013 --> 01:21:19.795]  It's now in the Encyclopedia and Dictionary, the word Google, it means search it.
[01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:24.958]  And so yes, that's why I've been trying to say Google it, search engine it.
[01:21:25.258 --> 01:21:27.760]  But I'll say search engine it and get emails going, what is that?
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.183]  And then it's a conspiracy theory that search engines exist, and I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:21:33.203 --> 01:21:39.026]  Kind of like when I say summer exists now, and we have normal climate change, they go, haha, this guy says there's
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.201]  Actual seasons!
[01:21:42.801 --> 01:21:44.822]  Everybody knows that's an Al-Qaeda code.
[01:21:44.842 --> 01:21:48.844]  Everybody knows that's anti-Semitic code to say that there's seasons.
[01:21:49.425 --> 01:21:51.106]  Ban climate denial!
[01:21:51.246 --> 01:21:51.986]  Arrest him!
[01:21:52.887 --> 01:21:56.629]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[01:21:57.370 --> 01:22:00.431]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[01:22:01.092 --> 01:22:03.433]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[01:22:03.993 --> 01:22:09.937]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:18.644]  The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[01:22:19.565 --> 01:22:26.629]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package, and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:31.382]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:22:31.622 --> 01:22:36.365]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:22:37.245 --> 01:22:40.527]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[01:22:41.147 --> 01:22:42.728]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:22:42.808 --> 01:22:44.469]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[01:22:52.751 --> 01:22:55.354]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:55.754 --> 01:23:00.739]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:01.099 --> 01:23:02.841]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:07.906]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:09.738 --> 01:23:09.838]  No.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.060]  It is a big idea.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.460]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:23:58.493 --> 01:24:01.214]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:24:01.754 --> 01:24:03.315]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:24:04.396 --> 01:24:06.657]  Put their objective be world domination.
[01:24:07.177 --> 01:24:09.638]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.

[01:24:32.585 --> 01:24:33.726]  Most people have no idea.
[01:24:33.746 --> 01:24:34.506]  They're not after money.
[01:24:34.526 --> 01:24:35.627]  They have all the money they need.
[01:24:35.827 --> 01:24:36.548]  They're after power.
[01:24:36.568 --> 01:24:37.668]  That's what they're after these days.

[01:24:49.476 --> 01:24:50.537]  You have been warned.
[01:24:51.431 --> 01:24:52.491]  Economy have you down?
[01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:54.211]  Scared you might lose your job?
[01:24:54.372 --> 01:24:56.252]  Worried how you will provide for your family?

[01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.590]  877-479-8178.
[01:25:55.961 --> 01:26:02.567]  You're traveling to another dimension.
[01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:05.990]  A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind.
[01:26:06.691 --> 01:26:09.914]  A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination.
[01:26:10.314 --> 01:26:11.515]  That's the signpost up ahead.
[01:26:11.555 --> 01:26:13.237]  Your next stop, the Twilight Zone.
[01:26:18.266 --> 01:26:19.147]  Wordsworth.
[01:26:19.627 --> 01:26:20.528]  Romney.
[01:26:21.249 --> 01:26:22.510]  Obsolescence.
[01:26:24.692 --> 01:26:25.732]  He's waiting, Chancellor.
[01:26:25.752 --> 01:26:26.833]  Alright, I'm in.
[01:26:30.036 --> 01:26:31.017]  Wordsworth.
[01:26:31.797 --> 01:26:32.818]  Romney.
[01:26:33.919 --> 01:26:35.100]  Obsolescence.
[01:26:39.104 --> 01:26:41.346]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[01:26:42.086 --> 01:26:43.507]  Because it leads to the future.
[01:26:44.248 --> 01:26:46.490]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:26:47.705 --> 01:26:48.765]  This is not a new world.
[01:26:49.946 --> 01:26:53.226]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:26:54.347 --> 01:27:01.849]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:27:02.769 --> 01:27:09.691]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:15.352]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:27:16.554 --> 01:27:18.836]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:27:24.141 --> 01:27:25.982]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:27:26.863 --> 01:27:32.528]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:27:33.529 --> 01:27:35.130]  Because he's built out of flesh.
[01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:37.112]  And because he has a mind.
[01:27:38.293 --> 01:27:42.877]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:27:51.283 --> 01:27:55.225]  Wordsworth, Romney, field investigation finding obsolescence.
[01:27:55.446 --> 01:27:56.966]  Do you know why you're here, Mr. Wordsworth?
[01:27:57.647 --> 01:27:58.187]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:58.387 --> 01:28:00.048]  I'd ask you to speak up a little, if you will.
[01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:02.250]  Yes, sir, I know why I'm here.
[01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:07.252]  You've been under investigation, Mr. Wordsworth, for the mandatory period of one year and eleven months.
[01:28:07.353 --> 01:28:08.613]  You're found to be obsolete.
[01:28:08.753 --> 01:28:12.135]  The purpose of this hearing is to make a finding in the matter and make a sentence accordingly.
[01:28:12.155 --> 01:28:13.036]  Do you understand that?
[01:28:13.056 --> 01:28:14.657]  Yes, I understand that.
[01:28:15.097 --> 01:28:16.778]  Your occupation, Mr. Wordsworth?
[01:28:16.798 --> 01:28:19.760]  A librarian, sir.
[01:28:25.191 --> 01:28:25.652]  A what?
[01:28:26.693 --> 01:28:27.774]  A librarian, sir.
[01:28:29.916 --> 01:28:31.057]  Has this man had counsel?
[01:28:31.217 --> 01:28:31.778]  Yes, sir, he has.
[01:28:31.818 --> 01:28:32.879]  Are you sure he knows his rights?
[01:28:32.899 --> 01:28:34.380]  He's been given orientation, sir.
[01:28:36.182 --> 01:28:38.444]  Mr. Wordsworth, I'm told that you've had counsel.
[01:28:38.524 --> 01:28:40.707]  Stand back in the light, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:51.406]  I'm told you've had counsel and been given orientation, Mr. Wordsworth, but I'm still not sure in my own mind that you understand the purpose of this hearing.
[01:28:52.007 --> 01:28:56.170]  The field investigators in your sector have classified you as obsolete.
[01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:59.072]  This finding carries with it serious implications.
[01:28:59.092 --> 01:29:01.054]  Do you understand that, Mr. Wordsworth?
[01:29:03.515 --> 01:29:05.417]  Now I ask you again, your occupation?
[01:29:07.014 --> 01:29:08.334]  I am a librarian, sir.
[01:29:08.854 --> 01:29:10.015]  That is my occupation.
[01:29:10.055 --> 01:29:10.895]  That is my profession.
[01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:15.336]  If you people choose to call that obsolete... Request clarification of the term?
[01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:15.896]  Yes.
[01:29:16.236 --> 01:29:18.657]  The term, Mr. Wordsworth, you people.
[01:29:18.717 --> 01:29:20.217]  You make reference to the state?
[01:29:20.297 --> 01:29:21.617]  I make reference to the state.
[01:29:21.937 --> 01:29:25.078]  And you persist in declaring your occupation as being that of a librarian.
[01:29:25.118 --> 01:29:25.718]  Is that correct?
[01:29:25.798 --> 01:29:26.558]  That is correct, sir.
[01:29:27.338 --> 01:29:28.439]  A librarian.
[01:29:31.059 --> 01:29:34.260]  Having to do with
[01:29:36.764 --> 01:29:37.085]  Yes, sir?
[01:29:37.645 --> 01:29:37.985]  Books.
[01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:45.769]  Since there are no more books, Mr. Wordsworth, there are no more libraries.
[01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:50.412]  And of course it follows that there is very little call for the services of a library.
[01:29:51.212 --> 01:29:52.773]  Case in point, a minister.
[01:29:53.714 --> 01:29:57.876]  A minister would tell us that his function is that of preaching the word of God.
[01:29:59.377 --> 01:30:03.119]  And of course it follows that since the state has proven that there is no God,
[01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:07.197]  That would make the function of a minister somewhat academic as well.
[01:30:07.217 --> 01:30:08.598]  There is a God.
[01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:16.123]  You are in error, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:30:16.303 --> 01:30:17.484]  There is no God.
[01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:18.785]  And see, here's the deal.
[01:30:19.685 --> 01:30:21.066]  The Soviets were atheists.
[01:30:21.887 --> 01:30:23.868]  And the issue is, you don't have to believe in God if you don't want to.
[01:30:24.228 --> 01:30:27.991]  The issue is, they come after you and arrest you if you do.
[01:30:29.403 --> 01:30:34.305]  And they've now introduced the bills that have passed the House and is in the Senate.
[01:30:35.605 --> 01:30:41.567]  The federal hate crimes bill has a longer title dealing with federalizing local law enforcement.
[01:30:42.207 --> 01:30:46.649]  And it doesn't just say that if you criticize somebody the state will decide and come arrest you.
[01:30:47.249 --> 01:30:52.371]  If what you said could have been hurtful or upsetting or if they say it intimidated them.
[01:30:53.871 --> 01:30:56.453]  It's also about federalizing local police.
[01:30:56.473 --> 01:30:57.773]  That's what the bill does.
[01:30:58.574 --> 01:31:01.736]  To where now their number one job is what you're saying, what you're doing.
[01:31:02.036 --> 01:31:09.460]  So they can now give the police a political lexicon to be political commissars over the society.
[01:31:11.542 --> 01:31:15.864]  Political police, when we say the commissar, that was the commissariat in Russia.
[01:31:17.225 --> 01:31:19.767]  Going around, they had hate crimes there too.
[01:31:20.905 --> 01:31:22.126]  And so everything's going to pass.
[01:31:22.166 --> 01:31:35.755]  The total Federal Reserve takeover of society, the banking takeover, through that, the environmental takeover with the carbon tax, the open borders to destroy the sovereignty of the country, the hate crimes bills restrict free speech.
[01:31:36.536 --> 01:31:38.197]  It's all happening right now.
[01:31:38.257 --> 01:31:39.578]  The federalization of water.
[01:31:40.098 --> 01:31:40.878]  They're taking over.
[01:31:40.898 --> 01:31:41.679]  It's a revolution.
[01:31:42.159 --> 01:31:43.060]  We're on the march.
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.141]  The empire's on the run.
[01:31:46.082 --> 01:31:48.744]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:51.684 --> 01:31:56.668]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:31:56.888 --> 01:32:00.672]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:00.912 --> 01:32:06.517]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:06.817 --> 01:32:11.681]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:11.881 --> 01:32:12.382]  Number three,
[01:32:12.782 --> 01:32:18.225]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:32:19.085 --> 01:32:21.726]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:32:21.986 --> 01:32:26.188]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:30.110]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:35.855]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:32:36.075 --> 01:32:40.639]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.321]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:42.561 --> 01:32:44.883]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:32:45.124 --> 01:32:47.766]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:32:51.269 --> 01:32:52.370]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:54.430]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:32:54.650 --> 01:32:55.291]  Well, you should.
[01:32:55.631 --> 01:32:59.873]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:33:00.113 --> 01:33:00.593]  That's right.
[01:33:00.913 --> 01:33:09.377]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:33:09.577 --> 01:33:10.817]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:33:10.937 --> 01:33:12.078]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:33:12.298 --> 01:33:17.921]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:33:18.281 --> 01:33:24.805]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:33:25.165 --> 01:33:30.368]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:31.828]  This is real.
[01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.889]  Don't miss out.
[01:33:33.209 --> 01:33:40.073]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:33:51.955 --> 01:34:01.057]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:34:01.237 --> 01:34:09.238]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:34:09.738 --> 01:34:09.878]  Correct.
[01:34:09.898 --> 01:34:13.899]  Clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:34:13.979 --> 01:34:16.599]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:34:16.739 --> 01:34:28.042]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:34:28.302 --> 01:34:34.483]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[01:34:34.743 --> 01:34:38.464]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[01:34:38.664 --> 01:34:42.487]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[01:34:49.292 --> 01:35:03.322]  I promise to get into this chemtrail news that's coming up.
[01:35:03.382 --> 01:35:05.003]  Let's get to your calls right now.
[01:35:05.284 --> 01:35:06.905]  Danny in Texas, go ahead, welcome.
[01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:11.630]  Hey Alex, good to hear from you, good to hear your show.
[01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:16.152]  A couple of quick points and a question, if you'll stay with me just a second.
[01:35:16.852 --> 01:35:23.354]  I'll qualify the first one by saying I'm not just buttering you up so you'll give me time on the radio.
[01:35:23.995 --> 01:35:31.177]  I would really covet an hour of conversation with just you, because I can't even get my wife to talk to me about this stuff.
[01:35:31.217 --> 01:35:35.639]  But anyway, it's an absolute priceless
[01:35:36.281 --> 01:35:37.281]  Anyway, I was reading
[01:36:06.164 --> 01:36:09.206]  A little booklet that my wife got me.
[01:36:09.326 --> 01:36:14.508]  It's entitled The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.
[01:36:15.049 --> 01:36:17.050]  And so that brings me to my second point.
[01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:20.872]  I'd like to challenge anyone out there that's listening today.
[01:36:21.112 --> 01:36:31.097]  If you can read the Declaration of Independence and or the preamble of the Constitution and not get chills up and down your spine,
[01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:34.962]  And or get angry about what's going on in our country today.
[01:36:35.342 --> 01:36:37.262]  You mean the Al-Qaeda tuition?
[01:36:38.602 --> 01:36:39.423]  Right, right.
[01:36:40.243 --> 01:36:44.784]  But I would think, I would certainly say that your patriot is probably dead.
[01:36:46.544 --> 01:36:47.584]  No, I agree with you a bit.
[01:36:47.604 --> 01:36:51.605]  Because when you read the Declaration of Independence, all the same stuff is happening today.
[01:36:53.125 --> 01:36:54.405]  Yeah, exactly right.
[01:36:55.006 --> 01:36:56.586]  And that brings me to my question.
[01:36:59.223 --> 01:37:01.704]  What is it that could be done?
[01:37:01.744 --> 01:37:06.967]  I mean, are these people all hedged off to where they can't be sued or arrested?
[01:37:07.007 --> 01:37:17.492]  Because it clearly says in the First Amendment to the Constitution, Congress shall make no laws, dot, dot, dot, you know, and it finishes the First Amendment.
[01:37:17.893 --> 01:37:19.053]  And, you know, it's nothing new.
[01:37:19.093 --> 01:37:22.715]  They've been doing that forever, but I mean, now they've really gotten to a point where
[01:37:23.326 --> 01:37:25.468]  It's self-destructive.
[01:37:25.508 --> 01:37:29.331]  It's going to do completely away with the First Amendment.
[01:37:29.351 --> 01:37:32.093]  This is what our country was founded on.
[01:37:32.133 --> 01:37:34.275]  This is what makes this country great.
[01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:38.298]  This is what we should go by for laws in our country.
[01:37:38.879 --> 01:37:41.601]  For them to just basically wipe their behinds with it,
[01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:54.512]  It makes me curious, it makes me want to... You know, I don't... Well, then if you try to stop them from wiping their behinds with the Constitution, they then call you a terrorist, and that's what the DHS reports are about.
[01:37:54.892 --> 01:38:00.356]  And that's the one big thing the globalists have on their side, is they are not short on bold.
[01:38:00.736 --> 01:38:05.279]  They got plenty of boldness, plenty of chutzpah, bravado, whatever you want to call it.
[01:38:05.299 --> 01:38:10.323]  They are very arrogant, a lot of hubris, and a few other choice words I can think of.
[01:38:11.567 --> 01:38:17.789]  To start teaching kids that there are no seasons?
[01:38:18.730 --> 01:38:23.211]  And to start teaching kids that it's normal to spy on your parents?
[01:38:23.331 --> 01:38:26.392]  I mean, it's all just over-the-top tyranny.
[01:38:26.952 --> 01:38:29.793]  And what tyrants do is, they come in and they practice tyranny.
[01:38:29.813 --> 01:38:33.435]  And if they can spy on people without warrants, well, they can ban the First Amendment.
[01:38:34.215 --> 01:38:39.597]  And if they can go in and federalize most of the preachers, and get them on an intelligence operation payroll,
[01:38:41.377 --> 01:38:48.362]  The problem is the government's organized, it's centralized, it's able to make mass changes, even if it's unpopular, even if it's criminal.
[01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:57.367]  We have to all locally sue them, speak out against them, say no, get really aggressive with government, and we've had a lot of victories against them.
[01:38:57.387 --> 01:39:08.515]  I mean, as bad as things are, things would be a lot worse if we hadn't been fighting them all along, but we also have to get all these comfortable people that don't think it's their job
[01:39:09.395 --> 01:39:15.501]  Folks are so selfish nowadays and so self-centered, they won't even get up off their fat butts to protect themselves.
[01:39:16.402 --> 01:39:23.969]  And so the next best thing we can do is say, OK, everything's going to collapse because you have this lackadaisical jackass attitude.
[01:39:24.369 --> 01:39:32.456]  And when it does collapse, don't blame the people that are still free market and still own some property and can still live their lives self-sufficiently.
[01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.638]  Because see, the howling mob of scum
[01:39:35.379 --> 01:39:37.280]  They're going to be the weapon the new order uses.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.481]  That's the big dirty secret.
[01:39:38.981 --> 01:39:49.228]  After the globalists are done collapsing things, the average scumbag out there is going to go suck their boots and prostrate themselves down before them and beg even more and grovel.
[01:39:49.248 --> 01:39:51.510]  Because that's all they know at a bestial level.
[01:39:51.790 --> 01:40:00.316]  And then the establishment's going to say, your enemies, those gun owners, those conservatives, those Christians, those liberals, those landowners, those... Get them!
[01:40:00.556 --> 01:40:01.637]  And the public's just going to go,
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:06.926]  And they'll put on a little, you know, it's like the Soviet Union or like a third world country.
[01:40:06.946 --> 01:40:11.854]  They're going to put on, you take a dumb, lazy scumbag who's watched TV their whole lives.
[01:40:11.874 --> 01:40:13.517]  You give them a machine gun and a uniform.
[01:40:13.717 --> 01:40:16.061]  They're ready to murder their neighbors and make excuses.
[01:40:16.281 --> 01:40:17.022]  It's a green tax.
[01:40:18.271 --> 01:40:23.558]  You know, it's, it's, oh, we're taking your kids, you, you know, the neighbor said they saw something, ah, sell the kids, ha ha!
[01:40:23.838 --> 01:40:29.286]  You know, it's just, it's, you know, now Texas police just pull people over and go, give me the cash, ha ha!
[01:40:29.646 --> 01:40:32.931]  And then, and then they go on TV and go, we take your money, ha ha ha!
[01:40:33.311 --> 01:40:39.232]  You know, I mean, it's just, it's like Chicago, where the police are openly corrupt and openly, they are the mafia.
[01:40:39.672 --> 01:40:41.813]  And so we just, we're turning into Mexico.
[01:40:42.193 --> 01:40:47.834]  And if we roll over like they do in Mexico to corruption, or we roll over like they did in Germany, we're going to be total slaves.
[01:40:47.894 --> 01:40:48.714]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:50.794 --> 01:40:51.874]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:40:51.894 --> 01:40:52.735]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:40:53.735 --> 01:40:55.735]  Yeah, Alex, how are you today?
[01:40:56.395 --> 01:40:57.315]  I'm doing all right, Bill.
[01:40:57.335 --> 01:40:58.036]  What's on your mind?
[01:40:58.596 --> 01:41:00.536]  Well, a couple of things.
[01:41:01.243 --> 01:41:21.600]  First of all, you were talking about the opium over there in Afghanistan, and I saw flashed across the news, you know, how they streamed that about a week to ten days ago, where Holbrook, you know, the fellow that's in the Bilderberger... Yeah, he's the Opium Don.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.102]  He's the Opium Czar over the plantations.
[01:41:24.322 --> 01:41:24.603]  Right.
[01:41:24.703 --> 01:41:29.547]  He made the statement that eradication will not work.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:38.167]  Therefore, they're giving up eradication of the opium because it would drive the farmers into the arms of the Taliban.
[01:41:46.673 --> 01:41:55.840]  They can't deny the government deals all the drugs now, so they just came out and said, well the army does protect the opium, and it does, and the army, U.S.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:01.343]  Army does allow them to sell it, because that way the Taliban doesn't get to make the money.
[01:42:01.383 --> 01:42:08.709]  So now, yes we ship, they even tell the troops, yes we ship the opium into America, we go ahead and arrest you when you use it though.
[01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:11.430]  But it's so the Taliban doesn't get the money.
[01:42:11.730 --> 01:42:13.790]  And that's the CIA, excuse me, 50 years ago.
[01:42:14.131 --> 01:42:16.791]  We're going to run the cocaine into America because there's a market.
[01:42:17.132 --> 01:42:17.752]  People want it.
[01:42:17.792 --> 01:42:20.673]  Besides, you guys want $5 million houses on Maui, right?
[01:42:21.393 --> 01:42:22.353]  It's for America.
[01:42:22.373 --> 01:42:23.574]  We're fighting communism.
[01:42:24.034 --> 01:42:26.495]  We can't let the communists make all that money.
[01:42:27.415 --> 01:42:28.436]  So we gotta do it.
[01:42:28.596 --> 01:42:29.696]  Hold on.
[01:42:30.157 --> 01:42:33.179]  Somebody's gotta do it, Bill, for America.
[01:42:33.759 --> 01:42:44.105]  And somebody's gotta own the private prisons off the laundered drug money to put your kids in it, so we bring in the heroin and we put you in our own prison?
[01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:46.307]  Because we're red, white, and blue, Bill!
[01:42:47.988 --> 01:42:51.470]  But I heard them on BBC admit it, but they said, well,
[01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:52.750]  The U.S.
[01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:55.751]  has an ingenious program so the Taliban doesn't get a foothold.
[01:42:56.132 --> 01:43:00.793]  The United States guards it and allows it to come to, and allows the farmers to have a little money.
[01:43:00.853 --> 01:43:01.494]  It's a U.S.
[01:43:01.534 --> 01:43:02.274]  welfare system.
[01:43:02.594 --> 01:43:06.075]  What they don't tell you is the warlords all own those different sectors.
[01:43:06.375 --> 01:43:06.916]  The U.S.
[01:43:06.976 --> 01:43:08.076]  made deals with them.
[01:43:08.316 --> 01:43:10.917]  The Taliban runs it.
[01:43:10.977 --> 01:43:14.359]  That's why the Taliban made the deal with the United States in 79.
[01:43:14.419 --> 01:43:15.299]  Brzezinski brags.
[01:43:15.519 --> 01:43:17.620]  We said, we'll take all the schmack you got.
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.022]  They all have little palaces.
[01:43:20.042 --> 01:43:22.344]  They don't show those on the news, but it's admitted they have them.
[01:43:22.364 --> 01:43:23.105]  I've seen photos.
[01:43:23.745 --> 01:43:25.227]  You can have your castles and palaces.
[01:43:25.287 --> 01:43:28.890]  We'll ship it into our whore public, just like with the Vietnamese.
[01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:30.832]  We'll sell our troops the heroin.
[01:43:30.852 --> 01:43:31.953]  They'll come home and get on it.
[01:43:32.274 --> 01:43:33.315]  We hate our people.
[01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:34.136]  We are scum.
[01:43:34.516 --> 01:43:37.018]  And the Taliban said, Heil Hitler!
[01:43:37.098 --> 01:43:37.679]  Hell yes!
[01:43:38.019 --> 01:43:39.701]  We want to sell our opium to you.
[01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:40.862]  And the rest is history.
[01:43:40.902 --> 01:43:41.202]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:41.222 --> 01:43:41.483]  Go ahead.
[01:43:42.435 --> 01:43:42.675]  All right.
[01:43:43.055 --> 01:43:44.896]  Well, anyway... No, that's how it works.
[01:43:44.937 --> 01:43:45.837]  That's how this works.
[01:43:45.897 --> 01:43:46.778]  Is it not sick?
[01:43:47.238 --> 01:43:47.638]  Is it not?
[01:43:47.798 --> 01:43:49.899]  They just admit now the government ships it in.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.820]  You're not with Al-Qaeda, are you, Bill?
[01:43:53.281 --> 01:43:55.042]  We gotta bring heroin in, Bill!
[01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:56.903]  It's to fight Al-Qaeda, Bill!
[01:43:58.304 --> 01:44:03.227]  Anyway, you know, when you were on the air here in central Wisconsin,
[01:44:04.008 --> 01:44:04.749]  I called in.
[01:44:04.829 --> 01:44:06.410]  In fact, I had a lot to do with it.
[01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:07.851]  I remember you on that show.
[01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:08.631]  You did call in.
[01:44:08.671 --> 01:44:13.074]  I was going to say that, but I thought I would dispense with the pleasantries and get right to interrupting you, Bill.
[01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:15.056]  Yeah, which you're good at.
[01:44:15.076 --> 01:44:17.017]  I am the champion.
[01:44:17.297 --> 01:44:17.938]  I'm just joking.
[01:44:17.958 --> 01:44:18.939]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:44:18.979 --> 01:44:19.859]  You do a good job.
[01:44:19.899 --> 01:44:25.343]  But anyway, they had Jerome Courcy on recently, and I brought up these same points.
[01:44:26.424 --> 01:44:30.907]  And then he's got an EVE book out.
[01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:33.851]  About how we have to attack Iran.
[01:44:33.911 --> 01:44:44.457]  So I jumped all over him, and I think he brings up a lot of good points, but he is not definitely on our side.
[01:44:45.298 --> 01:44:57.445]  He suggested people get Glenn Beck's book and get Michael Levine's book and all of this, and I said, these are all neocompositions.
[01:44:58.573 --> 01:44:59.614]  No, no, it's pretty clear.
[01:44:59.634 --> 01:45:01.155]  I mean, I mean, I've had Corsi on.
[01:45:01.215 --> 01:45:04.637]  Corsi is like a different person each interview he's on.
[01:45:04.657 --> 01:45:12.542]  And let me tell you, I think if you scratched Dr. Corsi, you might find something, you know, wearing a uniform underneath it.
[01:45:12.582 --> 01:45:14.283]  But you know what?
[01:45:15.744 --> 01:45:16.604]  I don't know what you do.
[01:45:16.804 --> 01:45:19.346]  You know, I mean, the globalists are taking over the planet.
[01:45:19.586 --> 01:45:21.487]  They're slapping us around and it's disgusting.
[01:45:24.409 --> 01:45:25.629]  I am a town chairman.
[01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:28.011]  I am also on the county board.
[01:45:28.556 --> 01:45:45.549]  I've gotten resolutions passed against legal and illegal drug abuse, against depleted uranium, against the Clean Water Restoration Act, against all of the legislation on the gardens and the organic farming.
[01:45:46.610 --> 01:45:54.816]  I got one supporting Ron Paul's resolution and his attempts to audit the Federal Reserve.
[01:45:55.157 --> 01:45:56.778]  I've gotten all of that passed.
[01:45:58.678 --> 01:46:05.303]  I've gone to the local sheriff who lives in the town that I'm a town chairman, given him the DVDs.
[01:46:05.784 --> 01:46:08.226]  He is aware of all of these situations.
[01:46:08.646 --> 01:46:14.851]  He has told me point blank that if the order comes to confiscate guns, he will not do so.
[01:46:15.427 --> 01:46:20.630]  Well, if other people would run for County Commissioner or City Councilman, like you've done, we'd save this country.
[01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:21.431]  That's what I keep saying.
[01:46:21.791 --> 01:46:30.177]  They focus us on these stupid Palin vs. Obama, you know, situations, instead of the local areas where the power is.
[01:46:30.477 --> 01:46:33.198]  That's where the globalists are coming in and buying folks off regionally.
[01:46:33.519 --> 01:46:34.399]  Good to hear from you, Bill.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:37.421]  You know, I promised to play this.
[01:46:37.481 --> 01:46:38.322]  It's ten minutes long.
[01:46:38.362 --> 01:46:39.903]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:46:40.563 --> 01:46:42.544]  The reason it's important, I can't find the tape.
[01:46:42.745 --> 01:46:44.386]  Similar newscast about Austin.
[01:46:45.171 --> 01:46:47.812]  Where they were spraying people, and everybody was getting sick.
[01:46:48.332 --> 01:46:50.353]  But the point is, this is not an unsolved mystery.
[01:46:50.733 --> 01:46:52.094]  This is declassified.
[01:46:52.694 --> 01:47:03.938]  That the government delivers different chemicals and biologicals in these jails, and at the end of the piece, I don't know if we'll have time to play that, at the end of the piece, they admit, oh, could it be a government inoculation?
[01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:10.961]  I'm sorry folks, these are eugenicists that are running things on record, so, no, it's not inoculation.
[01:47:12.042 --> 01:47:12.982]  You want to wonder why
[01:47:14.623 --> 01:47:20.408]  50 years ago it was like finding a leprechaun to find a kid who had cancer and now every street corner's got some kid dying of it.
[01:47:20.888 --> 01:47:23.491]  You know, go up and down the street and everybody's got their kids dying on you.
[01:47:24.191 --> 01:47:26.293]  It's the stuff they're putting in the water and the food and the air.
[01:47:26.333 --> 01:47:28.355]  These are control freak, eugenicists.
[01:47:28.615 --> 01:47:31.497]  But here's a little clip from Unsolved Mysteries from over a decade ago.
[01:47:31.537 --> 01:47:31.937]  Here it is.
[01:47:33.699 --> 01:47:34.379]  The blob.
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:38.283]  It came from the skies to wreak havoc on the earth.
[01:47:39.384 --> 01:47:41.986]  Strange blob-like droplets that look something like this.
[01:47:43.482 --> 01:47:52.208]  It sounds like a bad science fiction movie, but for a small town in the Pacific Northwest, there was nothing entertaining or fictional about the scourge that befell them in 1994.
[01:47:54.389 --> 01:48:01.594]  Six times it rained down from above, leaving dozens of local residents ill and several pets and small animals dead.
[01:48:05.356 --> 01:48:07.878]  It all happened in Oakville, Washington, population 665.
[01:48:10.216 --> 01:48:15.897]  Here in Oakville, clouds fill the sky daily, bringing rain some 275 days a year.
[01:48:18.738 --> 01:48:24.339]  So when it began pouring on the morning of August 7th, 1994, no one was particularly concerned.
[01:48:25.159 --> 01:48:27.480]  Until they realized it wasn't raining rain.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.881]  It was raining tiny blobs of gelatinous goo.
[01:48:32.121 --> 01:48:37.442]  It came down in torrents, blanketing 20 square miles, and brought with it something of a plague.
[01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:43.560]  I got sick, my wife got sick, my daughter, everybody that lived here got sick.
[01:48:43.701 --> 01:48:48.262]  Everybody in the whole town came down with like a flu, only it was a really hard flu.
[01:48:48.322 --> 01:48:51.823]  It didn't last like seven days, it lasted like seven weeks, two or three months.
[01:48:53.504 --> 01:48:57.245]  A local policeman was among the first to report the perplexing precipitation.
[01:48:58.125 --> 01:49:01.826]  Officer David Lacey was on patrol with a civilian friend at 3 a.m.
[01:49:02.127 --> 01:49:03.247]  when the downpour began.
[01:49:06.561 --> 01:49:07.602]  What's on the window there?
[01:49:07.622 --> 01:49:08.763]  I don't know.
[01:49:10.044 --> 01:49:13.627]  What I'm building up, is that inside the car?
[01:49:13.667 --> 01:49:20.052]  We turned our windshield wipers on, and it just started smearing to the point where we could almost not see.
[01:49:20.072 --> 01:49:24.596]  And we both looked at each other and we said, you know, Jesus isn't right.
[01:49:24.656 --> 01:49:29.039]  I mean, we're out in the middle of nowhere, basically, and where did this come from?
[01:49:32.002 --> 01:49:35.305]  Officer Lacey pulled into a gas station to de-goo his windshield.
[01:49:36.147 --> 01:49:39.069]  As an added precaution, he put on a pair of latex gloves.
[01:49:43.132 --> 01:49:44.733]  The substance was very mushy.
[01:49:45.914 --> 01:49:48.596]  It's almost like if you had jello in your hand.
[01:49:49.577 --> 01:49:52.519]  And, you know, you could pretty much squish it through your fingers.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.424]  We knew it wasn't something that we would normally see because we had never experienced it before.
[01:49:59.184 --> 01:50:05.309]  So we did have some bells go off in our heads that basically said that this isn't right, this isn't normal.
[01:50:07.338 --> 01:50:09.739]  Local resident Dottie Hearn was equally baffled.
[01:50:10.659 --> 01:50:15.481]  By the time she stepped outside that morning, the storm had ended, but the blobs were everywhere.
[01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:20.862]  It looked like hail, laying on top of a wood box and everywhere else.
[01:50:22.383 --> 01:50:28.745]  So I just went over and I touched it and it wasn't hail, it was a gelatinous-like material.
[01:50:32.006 --> 01:50:35.887]  By mid-afternoon, Officer Lacey had inexplicably taken ill.
[01:50:37.535 --> 01:50:39.616]  I was to the point where I could hardly breathe.
[01:50:40.516 --> 01:50:53.539]  I started to put together that possibly, whatever the substance was, it made me violently sick, you know, and ill, like I never had been before, to the point where, you know, it just totally shut me down.
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:59.001]  Across town, Dottie Hearn wasn't faring much better.
[01:51:01.008 --> 01:51:02.109]  I started feeling dizzy.
[01:51:02.129 --> 01:51:09.452]  Everything started moving around and around and it got worse and as it did, I became increasingly nauseated.
[01:51:12.294 --> 01:51:12.814]  Mom!
[01:51:13.815 --> 01:51:18.197]  An hour later, Donnie's daughter and son found her sprawled on the bathroom floor.
[01:51:18.217 --> 01:51:19.297]  Have you been sprawling around?
[01:51:19.317 --> 01:51:19.637]  Yes.
[01:51:19.918 --> 01:51:20.858]  Donnie, she's sick.
[01:51:21.258 --> 01:51:22.599]  She was cold.
[01:51:23.805 --> 01:51:25.486]  Drenched with perspiration.
[01:51:26.207 --> 01:51:26.748]  Pale.
[01:51:27.528 --> 01:51:29.691]  My mom had been vomiting.
[01:51:30.752 --> 01:51:32.573]  She had extreme vertigo.
[01:51:33.354 --> 01:51:36.117]  She complained that she had difficulty with her vision.
[01:51:36.257 --> 01:51:37.418]  Her vision was blurring.
[01:51:37.438 --> 01:51:41.742]  Dottie would spend the next three days in the hospital.
[01:51:42.283 --> 01:51:43.084]  The diagnosis?
[01:51:43.584 --> 01:51:45.246]  A severe inner ear infection.
[01:51:46.789 --> 01:51:57.233]  For some reason as we were going out the door I remembered the substance and I wondered if perhaps it might have had some sort of an effect on her.
[01:51:57.533 --> 01:51:59.053]  If it might have made her sick.
[01:51:59.914 --> 01:52:06.416]  So I opted at that moment to take a sample of this gelatinous material to the hospital.
[01:52:08.675 --> 01:52:11.018]  A lab technician found the first startling clue.
[01:52:11.738 --> 01:52:14.061]  The substance contained human white blood cells.
[01:52:14.802 --> 01:52:18.566]  But exactly what it was and why it fell from the sky could not be determined.
[01:52:21.124 --> 01:52:25.526]  The goo was promptly forwarded to the Washington State Department of Health for further analysis.
[01:52:25.566 --> 01:52:28.327]  Yeah, it was forwarded to the very group that probably sprayed it with the feds.
[01:52:28.368 --> 01:52:29.888]  There was no structure that we could see.
[01:52:29.908 --> 01:52:33.490]  The goo was directly forwarded to those that had done it, and they said it was good for you.
[01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:38.833]  Anyways, they basically then say, oh, it was the government inoculating you for your own good.
[01:52:38.853 --> 01:52:44.575]  Just like they radiated all those foster children to death for their own good, and those black men with syphilis.
[01:52:45.156 --> 01:52:47.137]  And again, those are just two of the ones you probably know about.
[01:52:47.157 --> 01:52:47.857]  There's thousands.
[01:52:52.205 --> 01:52:55.568]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:55.728 --> 01:53:00.932]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:53:01.112 --> 01:53:05.895]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:53:06.076 --> 01:53:17.064]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:53:17.324 --> 01:53:22.887]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:53:23.067 --> 01:53:29.150]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.951]  What about you?
[01:53:30.171 --> 01:53:32.072]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:53:32.092 --> 01:53:34.813]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:53:36.374 --> 01:53:38.636]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:53:38.656 --> 01:53:39.016]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[01:53:41.618 --> 01:53:43.079]  That's Directive, the number 21, dot com, now.
[01:53:43.099 --> 01:53:46.461]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:53:58.787 --> 01:54:04.129]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:54:04.649 --> 01:54:10.852]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:54:11.072 --> 01:54:12.973]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:54:13.133 --> 01:54:15.514]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:54:15.594 --> 01:54:26.318]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:54:28.763 --> 01:54:30.024]  It's not about left or right.
[01:54:30.444 --> 01:54:31.845]  It's about a one world government.
[01:54:32.286 --> 01:54:38.651]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:54:39.211 --> 01:54:46.977]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:47.478 --> 01:54:48.619]  The Obama Deception.
[01:54:49.059 --> 01:54:50.240]  The people strike back.
[01:54:51.766 --> 01:54:56.069]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:58.691]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:54:58.852 --> 01:55:08.319]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:55:08.519 --> 01:55:14.421]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:55:14.721 --> 01:55:17.222]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:55:17.422 --> 01:55:27.105]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[01:55:27.485 --> 01:55:28.126]  I think so.
[01:55:55.225 --> 01:55:57.946]  Alright, I'm going to jam in a few final phone calls here at the end.
[01:55:57.966 --> 01:56:00.607]  I didn't really thank any of the sponsors today, though I should have.
[01:56:00.627 --> 01:56:05.329]  One of them I do want to tell you about are these great folks.
[01:56:05.369 --> 01:56:15.912]  They've got the best prices I've found on these hidden cameras that shoots really good digital video and audio and is also a working pen.
[01:56:15.932 --> 01:56:18.293]  It's just got a little hidden camera right there.
[01:56:18.673 --> 01:56:23.835]  But the best system they've got is one that goes in your car and then just goes off a little digital
[01:56:26.092 --> 01:56:28.194]  Memory stick, but records hours and hours.
[01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:30.436]  So the police pull you over, never even know you have it.
[01:56:30.456 --> 01:56:31.517]  You go, dude, just play it.
[01:56:32.117 --> 01:56:36.061]  They got a call from the Wall Street Journal today going, you sponsor Alex Jones.
[01:56:37.762 --> 01:56:40.305]  Why are you engaged in anti-American activity?
[01:56:40.325 --> 01:56:41.806]  Don't you feel bad?
[01:56:42.687 --> 01:56:44.488]  You're not supposed to take the police.
[01:56:45.209 --> 01:56:46.930]  You're supposed to just trust your government.
[01:56:47.031 --> 01:56:48.512]  I mean, this is really getting ridiculous.
[01:56:49.599 --> 01:56:54.183]  In fact, speak of the devil, I'm calling that Wall Street Journal reporter right after this and I'm saying, I've never heard of such a hit piece.
[01:56:54.884 --> 01:56:56.965]  Now you're calling up trying to guilt my sponsors?
[01:56:57.926 --> 01:57:00.709]  This is going to be one hell of a hit piece when it comes out, I've got to tell you.
[01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:07.274]  Anyways, Diginet, mobile DVR that goes in your car and a bunch of other systems, just check out the website.
[01:57:07.295 --> 01:57:10.858]  It's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:57:10.998 --> 01:57:13.720]  Diginet, D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:14.461]  Diginet.
[01:57:15.452 --> 01:57:16.413]  Diginet.net.
[01:57:16.713 --> 01:57:17.613]  Very easy to remember.
[01:57:18.454 --> 01:57:23.376]  It's an unbiased witness and it is always at your side, ready to help in any case of necessity.
[01:57:24.017 --> 01:57:27.939]  In case of any emergency and is accessible as evidence in court, if necessary.
[01:57:28.799 --> 01:57:31.941]  They've got with two, four, eight gig and eight gig models.
[01:57:31.961 --> 01:57:35.363]  You can record two hours of continuous audio and video.
[01:57:36.043 --> 01:57:37.264]  You will not believe the quality.
[01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:39.545]  Click on the Diginet banner at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:39.605 --> 01:57:41.066]  If you forget the web address.
[01:57:41.506 --> 01:57:41.947]  Diginet.net.
[01:57:44.884 --> 01:57:48.026]  And they're saying nice things about us when the Wall Street Journal comes snaking around.
[01:57:48.666 --> 01:57:52.048]  I'm gonna call a reporter and go, not a hit piece, my butt!
[01:57:52.988 --> 01:57:54.409]  I mean, what is going on here?
[01:57:56.970 --> 01:58:00.312]  Alex Jones is radical, says there were once four seasons.
[01:58:00.752 --> 01:58:02.893]  His extreme schizophrenia continues.
[01:58:03.393 --> 01:58:06.415]  He believes the sun is the cause of heating on the planet.
[01:58:07.015 --> 01:58:08.316]  Jones doesn't stop there.
[01:58:08.776 --> 01:58:11.638]  He says a man and a woman are what manufactures a baby.
[01:58:12.298 --> 01:58:14.159]  Next, his arrest for hate speech.
[01:58:15.131 --> 01:58:17.432]  By the way, I just got some incredible hate speech news in.
[01:58:17.452 --> 01:58:21.154]  It's from a good source, NewsWithViews.com.
[01:58:21.615 --> 01:58:23.616]  I got Curt Nemo and Paul Watson doing an article on it.
[01:58:24.036 --> 01:58:28.338]  Attorney General to classify pro-life, pro-gun Americans as terrorists, period.
[01:58:29.139 --> 01:58:32.901]  So see, other groups get special rights, and if you hurt their feelings, you go to prison.
[01:58:33.121 --> 01:58:36.102]  But if you are a gun owner, you're going to a gulag, baby.
[01:58:36.122 --> 01:58:38.384]  The Ponytail Brigade wants your property.
[01:58:39.024 --> 01:58:40.765]  And I'm not against you if you got ponytails.
[01:58:40.805 --> 01:58:41.505]  You know what I mean.
[01:58:43.066 --> 01:58:44.347]  I mean, ponytails aren't all bad.
[01:58:47.446 --> 01:58:48.807]  Alright, let's go ahead.
[01:58:49.587 --> 01:58:51.688]  Even though Hartman says never trust somebody with a ponytail.
[01:58:52.708 --> 01:58:53.849]  Hartman, why do you say that?
[01:58:54.389 --> 01:58:55.509]  Turn the mic on for Hartman.
[01:58:57.570 --> 01:59:01.172]  It's just what I've learned in my 28 years of being a human.
[01:59:01.732 --> 01:59:05.274]  You can't trust anybody with a ponytail or with two first names.
[01:59:05.934 --> 01:59:06.754]  Or two last names.
[01:59:06.774 --> 01:59:07.335]  Ron Paul?
[01:59:08.575 --> 01:59:09.195]  Other than him.
[01:59:09.756 --> 01:59:11.656]  There's always one exception to the rule.
[01:59:11.676 --> 01:59:12.717]  I can do a little ponytail.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.301]  I'm just joking around.
[01:59:16.341 --> 01:59:16.962]  Thank you, Hoos.
[01:59:17.022 --> 01:59:17.702]  Everything's fine.
[01:59:18.503 --> 01:59:20.084]  Let's not turn off all the ponytail people.
[01:59:20.104 --> 01:59:21.225]  I think ponytails are cool!
[01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:25.629]  I'm serious.
[01:59:26.970 --> 01:59:29.453]  You know, why didn't I talk about Michael Jackson tickets?
[01:59:29.513 --> 01:59:31.474]  How do you get the 8,000 golden tickets?
[01:59:32.035 --> 01:59:33.877]  Why didn't I just talk about that all day?
[01:59:35.138 --> 01:59:36.399]  The public's insane!
[01:59:38.421 --> 01:59:39.722]  Oh my God, help me.
[01:59:40.442 --> 01:59:40.803]  Help me.
[01:59:42.116 --> 01:59:43.757]  I said I'd take calls and I'm out of time.
[01:59:44.397 --> 01:59:45.878]  Let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:47.519 --> 01:59:49.280]  I can't handle much more of this New World Order.
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.321]  I've tried to have a good attitude today.
[01:59:51.361 --> 01:59:52.262]  I've tried to be funny.
[01:59:52.842 --> 01:59:57.324]  I've tried to enjoy the raping and slaughtering and butchering of my country.
[01:59:57.845 --> 02:00:00.026]  But I've enjoyed just about as much as I can stand.

[02:00:43.535 --> 02:00:48.157]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:00:48.257 --> 02:00:51.018]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:00:51.218 --> 02:00:54.079]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:00:54.279 --> 02:00:59.001]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
