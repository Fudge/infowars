[00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:09.692]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:11.273]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:12.214]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:17.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:24.146]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:26.489]  Well, I'm very, very thankful that
[00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:51.354]  Decided to tune in today on this Thursday the 24th day of September 2009 You are not going to be disappointed with the caliber of the guest and information today there have been huge massively important Developments and I am going to attempt to be calm and cover all of this today first off
[00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:58.107]  Later in the hour, Congressman Alan Grayson will be joining us.
[00:00:58.107 --> 00:01:05.817]  A Democrat from Florida who has been really even giving Ron Paul a run for his money when it comes to exposing the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.761]  We're very thankful for what Congressman Alan Grayson is doing.
[00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.642]  He's coming up.
[00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:10.583]  And then Ron Paul!
[00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:14.725]  Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul, coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:18.105]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny on the latest on what's happening with the flu.
[00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:19.726]  We haven't had her on in about a month.
[00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:35.429]  Big update with her, and then we're going to have live reports from the G20 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Jason Burmas, and we're going to get a pop-in from the folks at We Are Change, as well, that are there on the ground.
[00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.809]  Now, I have Congressman
[00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:46.183]  Grayson coming up and these congressmen get so busy with interviews and when Congress is in session that it's a hovering interview.
[00:01:46.183 --> 00:01:50.844]  Anytime from 1115 to 1130, anytime in the next 30 minutes he's going to be on with us.
[00:01:50.844 --> 00:02:04.887]  So I don't want to launch our main story right now because there are so many issues, so many angles, so many points I want to make and I want to be extremely focused
[00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:26.141]  With what I'm going to reveal and cover here today because I literally had a brainstorm last night and a brainstorm this morning and just so much that was hidden in plain view that we've covered but not really put together completely came into very clear focus for me especially this morning.
[00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:26.702]  Red Alert!
[00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:36.916]  RedAlert at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and maybe every six months or so we issue a RedAlert or MaximumAlert as I sometimes call them.
[00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:39.237]  We've issued two in the last two days.
[00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:41.277]  The first one was MaximumAlert U.S.
[00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:43.338]  Troops Now Occupying America.
[00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:53.380]  All over the country from the East Coast to the West Coast and every major state, videos are pouring in of regular Army, regular Marines, National Guard, Air Force, National Guard, Army.
[00:02:55.224 --> 00:03:04.512]  Marine Corps Reserve, running illegal checkpoints all over the country, pulling people out of cars, shutting down highways, pointing guns at people.
[00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:05.713]  They are locked and loaded.
[00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:07.474]  They are armed.
[00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:11.037]  And there's just massive activity going on under NORTHCOM.
[00:03:11.037 --> 00:03:17.042]  Open announcements of 379,000 troops to be phased in in the next year on the streets of your town and city.
[00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:20.145]  The Pentagon told Congress they're going to even be in small towns.
[00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:21.906]  They're going to be merging in with their local police.
[00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:23.207]  It's high treason.
[00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.168]  Absolute red dawn.
[00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:34.747]  Now, that said, I openly announced I was sending my crew to the G20.
[00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:45.854]  They openly went out because Defense Link and the Pentagon reported that at a National Guard base, they were massing 2,500
[00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:53.809]  Army National Guard, Air Force Guard, MPs, regular Army MPs, and Air Force MPs.
[00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.869]  That's in the Defense Link articles.
[00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:05.471]  And so we drive up the front gate, as I've done many times at other events, and said, we'd like to talk to your information officer about where you're going to be deployed, what your mission is.
[00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:14.413]  And I'm going to tell the story later in the show, and I did call and talk to the Pittsburgh County Police in the county that Pittsburgh's in.
[00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:21.444]  And it's just absolutely horrible what happened.
[00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:36.792]  They called the renter car place off the license plate on the car because they went to the front gate and they basically got the cell phone number and information for Jason Douglas, one of our team members, and called him up.
[00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:44.529]  And basically said, we know you're a terrorist and you're going to be on the terror list for the rest of your life.
[00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.632]  And was basically laughing about it.
[00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:48.233]  And it just really hit me.
[00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.936]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:53.619]  The essence of tyranny.
[00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:55.882]  Of, haha, I'm putting you on the dissident list.
[00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.644]  You've got to wear the yellow star.
[00:04:57.644 --> 00:04:58.845]  And they love it.
[00:04:58.845 --> 00:04:59.425]  They love it.
[00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:08.058]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:14.147]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.811]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:23.376]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:27.440]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.804]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:35.126]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.888]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:39.410]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.154]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:47.858]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:50.981]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.882]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.882 --> 00:05:54.984]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:02.776]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:05.177]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:07.758]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:09.039]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.739]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:13.601]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:17.242]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.017]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:32.879]  An inside job.
[00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:39.663]  How dare you?
[00:06:39.663 --> 00:06:43.085]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.085 --> 00:06:45.966]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:52.429]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:55.291]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:57.552]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:00.013]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:04.013]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:07:04.013 --> 00:07:07.934]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:11.656]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:19.138]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.020]  I think so.
[00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:55.564]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:07:55.564 --> 00:08:02.007]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:08.650]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:16.574]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:18.315]  To say that my life
[00:08:19.813 --> 00:08:28.119]  And all of our lives living in this bizarre civilization on this tiny planet.
[00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:31.482]  But all of our lives are like an episode of the Twilight Zone.
[00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:37.846]  But in the last 24 hours, it's really gotten weird.
[00:08:37.846 --> 00:08:43.170]  Headline, ladies and gentlemen, up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:47.914]  We're going to have a more detailed report later today.
[00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:48.735]  I wrote this up.
[00:08:49.670 --> 00:09:04.859]  with Aaron Dykes last night and then integrated it in with the basic account of our three InfoWars crew members in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the G20 Summit.
[00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:05.439]  Red alert!
[00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:10.482]  Military attempts to frame InfoWars reporters for terrorism at G20.
[00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:13.124]  I will give you all the details on that
[00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:22.256]  Coming up, also, if you go to CNN or the Drudge Report, we of course have it all posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:26.698]  It's headlines like, The End of the Dollar!
[00:09:26.698 --> 00:09:32.842]  G20 Discusses Removing Dollar as World Currency.
[00:09:32.842 --> 00:09:38.805]  These are the types of headlines that are in the AP, AFP, Reuters.
[00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:43.388]  There are more than a hundred in the last two days that I have seen.
[00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:52.256]  You just Google the term New World Order and click News, you'll see hundreds and hundreds of news stories just in the last couple days.
[00:09:52.256 --> 00:10:05.148]  Reporting that world government is being established, the President of the Czech Republic, who's also President of the EU right now, openly said the answers to our global economic crises are not global government.
[00:10:05.148 --> 00:10:07.951]  He said that in his presidential speech at the UN yesterday.
[00:10:09.246 --> 00:10:15.671]  Muammar Gaddafi said H1N1 is a government biological weapon just like AIDS is.
[00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:18.433]  Boy, he couldn't be telling more of the truth.
[00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:21.735]  He went on to say basically the government killed Kennedy.
[00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:25.598]  Just, I mean, I'm living in the twilight zone here.
[00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:33.924]  I mean, you've got the head of the Czech Republic coming out and saying we don't want a world government.
[00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.445]  You've got Gaddafi running around
[00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:40.799]  Talking about the JFK assassination and H1N1.
[00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:59.725]  And then on top of all that, a little more than a month ago, I'm sitting there at Charlie Sheen's house, and it's funny, I even meant to talk about this on air, but I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't know how to broach it with listeners.
[00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:19.459]  But now, since it's been on national TV that he met with Buzz Aldrin and had dinner with him, because the paparazzi showed up, TMZ and ET and a bunch of other shows have played it, you know, with Charlie last week, week and a half ago, having dinner with Buzz Aldrin in Los Angeles where he lives.
[00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:20.781]  I'm at Charlie Sheen's house.
[00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:27.482]  Now, this is Twilight Zone, and there's more to it, but I'm not going to go much further.
[00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:30.904]  And we're sitting there talking about, were the moon landings real?
[00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:46.437]  Yes, we think they're real, but they're hiding secret technology, so they didn't want to show all of that, and that's what I've got from insiders at NASA, people like Raymond Teague, who I've had on the show, who was in Mission Control, frontline, and they had three backups, or three total, two backups.
[00:11:46.437 --> 00:11:50.080]  He was on the front, you know, A-team, first string.
[00:11:51.348 --> 00:12:00.618]  Yes, the intel I've got is that they're covering up massive water on the moon and that it basically covers the entire surface under a permafrost a few feet under the ground.
[00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:13.477]  And Charlie says, yes, I've read that as well.
[00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:22.382]  And Charlie, and then his phone rings and it's his stuntman, who in all his big movies has been a stuntman, one of his best friends.
[00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:27.245]  And he says, I just had dinner with Buzz Aldrin.
[00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:30.748]  This is before Charlie ever met Buzz Aldrin, went to dinner with him.
[00:12:30.748 --> 00:12:32.128]  You're not going to believe this.
[00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:34.630]  It's going to be coming out in the next month, but it's top secret.
[00:12:38.388 --> 00:12:47.092]  And then, I look at the Times of London today, and there's the headline, and I told my wife about this, and I said, I don't know how to handle it.
[00:12:47.092 --> 00:13:03.921]  And I think I even mentioned when I got back, big news on the moon coming out, but I didn't want to... I probably should have, but I was so focused on Charlie about to go public with 9-11, and that was a secret at the time, and a lot of other things we're doing behind the scenes that'll remain secret for some time.
[00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:16.778]  And then I turn on the Drudge Report this morning, India's lunar mission finds evidence of water on moon, covering most of the surface times of London.
[00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:18.499]  I mean, imagine what Buzz Aldrin knows.
[00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:24.142]  He's talking about that monolith on the moon of Mars.
[00:13:24.142 --> 00:13:29.766]  He comes on my show, and we later talk to his publicist.
[00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:31.307]  She's like, oh yeah, Buzz knows who you are.
[00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:32.848]  You know, Buzz likes what you're doing.
[00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:44.414]  When I called the Pittsburgh Police up, called the number back that they called up trying to frame our employees, trying to set them up, the guy goes, I know who you are, Alex.
[00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:47.875]  I know who you were before I Googled you.
[00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:53.477]  So it's just interesting to know Buzz Aldrin knows who we are and the Pittsburgh Police do.
[00:13:53.477 --> 00:13:55.518]  It's just crazy.
[00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:59.699]  But side issue, I'm going to talk about that later when I get some time, or maybe tomorrow.
[00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:08.345]  It's just so bizarre to know over a month beforehand that the Indian probe, that's what Buzz Aldrin told Charlie Stuntman.
[00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:10.907]  And I'm going to get Charlie on next week.
[00:14:10.907 --> 00:14:14.011]  We'll get Charlie to tell the story more fully.
[00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:18.035]  And I forgot to ask him if he talked about this at dinner with Buzz Aldrin.
[00:14:18.035 --> 00:14:19.057]  They had like a two hour dinner.
[00:14:20.657 --> 00:14:34.347]  But it's just so weird to know Charlie Sheen and Buzz Aldrin and a month and a week before it comes out in the news to know that they discovered ice basically covering the entire surface of the moon.
[00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:41.392]  Such a huge development.
[00:14:41.392 --> 00:14:42.612]  It's just crazy.
[00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:49.929]  And to have the Army lie to the police and tell them all these lies about what my employees were doing.
[00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:57.250]  Remember how they arrested that woman in New York because she went to an Army base and was asking them if they were a designated FEMA camp and they arrested her?
[00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.811]  And she was a mother of three, no criminal record, pretty wealthy.
[00:15:01.811 --> 00:15:06.612]  And they put her in a mental institution saying she was crazy because she believed in FEMA camps.
[00:15:06.612 --> 00:15:08.333]  And the news reported it like it was good.
[00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:15.269]  I mean, I guess we're blessed they didn't just grab my employees and put them in a mental institution.
[00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:24.697]  They pulled up at the armory and said, we'd like to talk to your public information officer about the Defense Link press release you put out.
[00:15:24.697 --> 00:15:30.721]  And then they said, you're not real media, we've never heard of InfoWars, or that you're on the radio in Austin, or KLBJ, or Channel 10.
[00:15:32.864 --> 00:15:38.267]  And then they, we want to talk to your boss, we want to talk to your producer, or editor, they kept calling it.
[00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:39.908]  Like it was a newspaper.
[00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:43.010]  We never said we were a newspaper, we said we were a TV with cameras.
[00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:49.534]  And, so they call me on the cell, and they go, here you go sir, here's Alex Jones, our boss.
[00:15:49.534 --> 00:15:52.316]  And the guy starts laughing, going, ah, that could be anybody.
[00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:54.177]  Maybe come back tomorrow, maybe we'll talk to you.
[00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:55.898]  So I hear him leave, and they go, okay.
[00:15:55.898 --> 00:16:01.201]  I go, well go interview troops downtown, which they've now done, and go interview police and ask them about posse comitatus, which they've now done.
[00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:07.334]  And then, I mean, I'm talking to him as he gets in the car and drives off.
[00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.115]  Well, they get a call at their hotel.
[00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:09.695]  Hi!
[00:16:09.695 --> 00:16:11.616]  Alamo Rental Car!
[00:16:11.616 --> 00:16:15.017]  You know, you got bad brakes on that car.
[00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:16.237]  We need you to bring that back in.
[00:16:16.237 --> 00:16:18.938]  We're going to give you two free days for the trouble.
[00:16:18.938 --> 00:16:24.160]  And by then, they'd locked down downtown Pittsburgh.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:31.663]  And so, Jason Douglas tells the police officer posing as an Alamo Rental Car agent,
[00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:39.887]  He tells him, and I talked to the cop, the cop admitted that this is what Jason did and what the cop did.
[00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:41.587]  Both their stories match.
[00:16:41.587 --> 00:16:44.088]  They're both saying the same thing.
[00:16:44.088 --> 00:16:46.908]  And he says, listen, I'm locked down.
[00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:47.929]  They've now blocked the streets.
[00:16:47.929 --> 00:16:49.889]  I can bring it back to you tomorrow.
[00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:50.989]  I guess we can bring the car back.
[00:16:50.989 --> 00:16:53.030]  And the guy goes, let me be honest with you.
[00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.890]  I'm with an anti-terrorism task force with the FBI and the U.S.
[00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.811]  Army.
[00:16:57.811 --> 00:17:01.832]  And you're going to be on a database for the rest of your life.
[00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:13.860]  I mean, it's so crazy that they just put reporters on terrorism watch lists for just going to Pittsburgh and trying to talk to a public information officer.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.362]  And then they call it with ruses.
[00:17:15.362 --> 00:17:19.326]  I mean, this country's so far gone with the terror watch list and the rest of it.
[00:17:19.326 --> 00:17:20.607]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got him.
[00:17:20.607 --> 00:17:21.468]  A vote is coming up.
[00:17:21.468 --> 00:17:22.710]  We normally go to a break in a moment.
[00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.573]  I'm going to skip this break coming up at the 20 after.
[00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:32.610]  Congressman Alan Grayson is a Democratic Congressman in Florida's 8th Congressional District.
[00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.452]  He's a graduate of Harvard College.
[00:17:35.452 --> 00:17:39.554]  And without going through his lengthy bio here, he's been a big supporter of H.R.
[00:17:39.554 --> 00:17:46.018]  1207, and he's one of the leading lights now calling for an audit of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:50.160]  And he's really grilled Bernanke and Geithner and others.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.122]  And we're just very, very blessed to have him in Congress.
[00:17:54.122 --> 00:17:55.363]  Congressman, thank you for joining us.
[00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:56.812]  Thank you, thank you.
[00:17:56.812 --> 00:18:12.000]  And if we're going to talk about what I've done before, the thing I'm most proud of is that for years I fought war profiteers in Iraq, and I was the litigator, the prosecutor in every single case pending in federal court and being litigated against war profiteers before I was elected to Congress.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.643]  So that's the one thing I'd want people to know about where I was and what I did in the first 50 years of my life.
[00:18:18.217 --> 00:18:18.918]  Absolutely.
[00:18:18.918 --> 00:18:21.842]  In fact, Congressman, I was fluid with your scheduler.
[00:18:21.842 --> 00:18:27.390]  It's been very helpful, but just so I know, so I know what I can get to, how long do we have with you?
[00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.752]  It's difficult to predict.
[00:18:28.752 --> 00:18:30.014]  We might have 10 or 15 minutes.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.821]  Okay, great.
[00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:38.027]  Well, let's talk about that then first, Congressman, because I am not a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:18:38.027 --> 00:18:46.597]  No-bid contracts even for American companies, $15 million for a blue tarp, Halliburton and the Chicago Tribune running child kidnapping rings.
[00:18:46.597 --> 00:18:48.118]  You were there exposing all this.
[00:18:48.118 --> 00:18:48.679]  Tell us about it.
[00:18:49.252 --> 00:18:52.954]  Well, it's everything you could imagine that's bad and worse.
[00:18:52.954 --> 00:19:01.659]  You have documented situations where, that people have heard about, where our contractors were putting in showers that ended up electrocuting the troops.
[00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:10.724]  We have documented situations where our contractors were providing the water in 120 degree heat that the troops used that was poison water.
[00:19:10.724 --> 00:19:12.365]  It was dirtier than the Euphrates River.
[00:19:13.423 --> 00:19:22.225]  And these are shocking things that really did happen, because these contractors are completely unscrupulous, and they're only in it for a buck.
[00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:31.548]  As President Lincoln said during the Civil War, people like that are worse than people who commit treason, worse than traitors.
[00:19:31.548 --> 00:19:36.909]  They act surreptitiously, and they end up not only overcharging us, but literally killing our troops.
[00:19:37.694 --> 00:19:54.865]  Well now, BlackwaterUSAXZ, not just all the federal filings of murder teams and intimidation as reportedly killing their own people, but it's confirmed LA Times, they're now assisting police in marijuana dispensary raids.
[00:19:56.345 --> 00:20:05.607]  Well, you know, anybody who cares anything about freedom, about liberty, about simple fiscal responsibility has to be shocked by what we're seeing here every day.
[00:20:05.607 --> 00:20:07.627]  It's true across the board.
[00:20:07.627 --> 00:20:11.468]  These people have no conscience.
[00:20:11.468 --> 00:20:21.930]  Congressman, since Halliburton and NXZ and all of them have moved offshore now, will they ever be brought to justice or will they just now occupy the United States and eat out our substance?
[00:20:22.423 --> 00:20:26.577]  Well, the one thing we can do is we can cut them off when it comes to getting our money.
[00:20:26.577 --> 00:20:28.784]  I was really excited and happy.
[00:20:29.352 --> 00:20:41.777]  To find out that we passed, that we've been able to do something about that now because in this bill that was provided to the House that was voted on overwhelmingly last week to cut off funding to ACORN.
[00:20:41.777 --> 00:20:49.040]  The same bill cuts off funding to any organization that has filed a fraudulent form with any federal or state regulatory agency.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.940]  I noticed that.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.402]  I immediately put up a website and invited people to nominate.
[00:20:54.204 --> 00:20:58.226]  Corrupt contractors who have filed fraudulent forms with the federal government.
[00:20:58.226 --> 00:21:00.727]  Our list is well over 200 and growing.
[00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:02.287]  Wow, that is really smart.
[00:21:02.287 --> 00:21:04.328]  Can you give us the website, sir?
[00:21:04.328 --> 00:21:06.029]  I'll get the website for you.
[00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:08.810]  I'll try to give you information about the website.
[00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.752]  But the main thing is that we're going to keep the pressure on and make sure they don't change this.
[00:21:14.392 --> 00:21:30.157]  Because, you know, the leadership on both sides, both parties, are inevitably going to be hearing from these corrupt defense contractors who have cheated us out of hundreds of billions, and even billions of dollars, and they're going to say, please, please, have mercy on us, even after they've cheated us this way.
[00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:31.978]  I say, cut them off, start over again.
[00:21:33.632 --> 00:21:34.512]  Well, absolutely.
[00:21:34.512 --> 00:21:39.734]  Now there are more contractors in Iraq than there are troops, and that's what I like, is that you're non-partisan.
[00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:43.376]  You just expose the corruption right across the board.
[00:21:43.376 --> 00:21:44.156]  That's a great point.
[00:21:44.156 --> 00:21:50.558]  I mean, ACORN is definitely a big city machine, very seedy, but that's what I was thinking last week watching Fox.
[00:21:50.558 --> 00:21:51.839]  They love it.
[00:21:51.839 --> 00:22:02.103]  They can focus on that one area of corruption and then ignore Halliburton that the Chicago Tribune reported kidnaps people and runs slave factories?
[00:22:02.683 --> 00:22:09.224]  According to the Project on Government Oversight, every single one of the top ten contractors has been found guilty.
[00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:17.966]  Not just accused of, but actually found guilty of filing fraudulent forms with the government to the tune of at least half a billion dollars or more.
[00:22:17.966 --> 00:22:21.707]  So I think we're finally reached a point now where we're going to actually do something about it.
[00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:22.607]  And I say that's great.
[00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:23.627]  Let's stop the fraud.
[00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:25.128]  Let's stop the cheating.
[00:22:25.128 --> 00:22:26.928]  Let's start over again.
[00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:30.629]  Well, speaking of cheating, the ringleaders, as you know, are the private
[00:22:31.604 --> 00:22:46.158]  Corporations, the brokerage firms and banks that have a revolving door into the regulators who have created tens of trillions in fiat derivatives and now have us bailing them out and then we get to pay interest on the money we bail them out with as they loan it back to us.
[00:22:46.158 --> 00:22:47.700]  Where is the audit of the Fed going?
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.043]  I read it's got 290 sponsors in the House, sir.
[00:22:51.043 --> 00:22:54.166]  Will we be able to audit this secretive private consortium?
[00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:58.388]  Well, it certainly is looking that way, and it's because of a lot of hard work that we did.
[00:22:58.388 --> 00:23:08.273]  I took that bill, which traditionally has been thought of as a Republican bill, and I took that bill around to my Democratic colleagues on the floor of the House week after week after week for months.
[00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:13.243]  And got over a hundred of them to sign up for that bill and make it a bipartisan bill.
[00:23:13.243 --> 00:23:16.926]  Now with 435 members of the House, over 290.
[00:23:16.926 --> 00:23:20.069]  Yesterday the count was 292.
[00:23:20.069 --> 00:23:20.569]  292 of us.
[00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:23.012]  More than two-thirds of the House has signed on to that bill.
[00:23:23.012 --> 00:23:26.555]  Not just saying that they're going to vote for it, but actually sponsoring it.
[00:23:26.555 --> 00:23:28.036]  So I'm very encouraged.
[00:23:28.036 --> 00:23:31.780]  The bill was originally filed in 1983 by Ron Paul.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.282]  Dr. Paul filed that bill when I was still in school.
[00:23:35.994 --> 00:23:44.458]  And here we are, many, many, many years later, more years than I care to think about, and the bill is finally going to have a hearing tomorrow.
[00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:53.343]  Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, we're going to have a hearing after 26 years on this bill, and it's going to reach the floor of the House, and it's going to pass.
[00:23:53.343 --> 00:23:54.884]  So I think this is great news.
[00:23:54.884 --> 00:23:56.524]  We need this so badly.
[00:23:56.524 --> 00:24:05.149]  When Bernanke last came to testify, it lit up the Internet when he testified that he had given a half a trillion dollars
[00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.440]  Think about this.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.721]  500 million dollars.
[00:24:09.721 --> 00:24:13.542]  Half a trillion dollars to foreigners, and he didn't know who got the money.
[00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:15.603]  500 billion.
[00:24:15.603 --> 00:24:17.364]  500 billion dollars.
[00:24:17.364 --> 00:24:18.405]  Which is 500,000 million.
[00:24:18.405 --> 00:24:21.926]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:24:21.926 --> 00:24:32.231]  We're talking about an enormous, staggering amount of money, almost $2,000 for every single American, and the Federal Reserve handed it out to foreign central banks, and I said, who did they give it to?
[00:24:32.231 --> 00:24:32.851]  He said, I don't know.
[00:24:34.053 --> 00:24:35.213]  I don't know who they gave it to.
[00:24:35.213 --> 00:24:36.874]  Which, of course, is a complete lie.
[00:24:36.874 --> 00:24:40.815]  It actually leaked on the major papers.
[00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:43.735]  The French banks, the German banks, the British banks.
[00:24:43.735 --> 00:24:55.398]  We were financing, we, the US taxpayers, were financing bailouts to virtually every single big foreign company in the world, but not to our own.
[00:24:55.398 --> 00:24:58.759]  Because if you need a bailout here in America, you could go to hell.
[00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:03.235]  We set up, the Federal Reserve, in our name as U.S.
[00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:11.450]  taxpayers, set up a credit line equal to $3,000 for every single person in New Zealand.
[00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.172]  In New Zealand!
[00:25:13.504 --> 00:25:14.965]  Where was our credit line?
[00:25:14.965 --> 00:25:17.467]  We had small businesses who couldn't get any loans.
[00:25:17.467 --> 00:25:19.508]  We still have small businesses who can't get any loans.
[00:25:19.508 --> 00:25:23.591]  We had people losing their homes because they couldn't refinance their mortgages.
[00:25:23.591 --> 00:25:26.853]  Well, clearly, sir, they were lending money to people in New Zealand.
[00:25:26.853 --> 00:25:27.433]  Well, clearly.
[00:25:27.433 --> 00:25:30.455]  I mean, do you agree that that's the classic banking scam?
[00:25:30.455 --> 00:25:33.137]  They make their real profits when people implode.
[00:25:33.137 --> 00:25:34.938]  They export the money and then...
[00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:50.948]  Freeze assets and capital here so that the economy on Main Street further folds so they can then come in, the banks flush with cash, buy up banks, insurance companies, and consolidate the economy.
[00:25:50.948 --> 00:25:52.769]  That's exactly right.
[00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:55.790]  And it's a horror show for the ordinary American.
[00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:01.494]  What's happened here is that the banks have taken Uncle Sam and made him into Uncle Sap.
[00:26:01.494 --> 00:26:02.014]  Wow.
[00:26:02.014 --> 00:26:03.935]  They've treated us like saps for too long.
[00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.895]  And this is what this audit is going to expose.
[00:26:07.895 --> 00:26:12.441]  Now, they've hired a bunch of high-powered lobbying firms, as you know, Congressman Grayson.
[00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:13.683]  I know, I know.
[00:26:13.683 --> 00:26:17.488]  Yes, as a matter of fact, they hired Enron's lobbyists.
[00:26:17.488 --> 00:26:18.089]  And why not?
[00:26:18.089 --> 00:26:21.174]  If you're doing Enron accounting, why would you hire Enron's lobbyists?
[00:26:22.801 --> 00:26:29.625]  This lobbyist issued a statement saying, these people who support this bill to audit the Federal Reserve, they don't understand economics.
[00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:36.990]  Well, it's a funny thing to say to me because I actually worked for four years as an economist before I graduated from law school.
[00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:42.795]  She was saying, oh, they don't know the difference between monetarism and fiscal policy and the other thing.
[00:26:42.795 --> 00:26:46.177]  And here I am, the only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist.
[00:26:47.854 --> 00:26:52.958]  This lobbyist, this K Street Whore, is trying to teach me about economics.
[00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:54.399]  And all of us.
[00:26:54.399 --> 00:26:57.902]  This K Street Whore is trying to teach me about economics?
[00:26:57.902 --> 00:26:59.864]  Who was that particular K Street Whore?
[00:26:59.864 --> 00:27:01.725]  Well, I don't remember her name.
[00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:03.347]  This was several months ago.
[00:27:03.347 --> 00:27:05.028]  But you can look it up.
[00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:13.876]  The head lobbyist, Ren Ron, was hired with our taxpayer money to try to fend off this effort to get transparency at the Federal Reserve.
[00:27:15.874 --> 00:27:20.215]  And by the way, yes, for the website, you can go to Grayson.house.gov.
[00:27:20.215 --> 00:27:21.976]  Grayson.house.gov.
[00:27:21.976 --> 00:27:33.259]  That's our website, and there'll be a link to the list, and I hope people will go and nominate companies that have cheated the government and need to be debarred from federal contracting so they stop stealing from us.
[00:27:37.248 --> 00:27:39.289]  What is the game plan?
[00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:43.110]  How do we make sure we get this audit of the Fed?
[00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:53.612]  The Senate, as you know, blocked discussion of the bill brought forward by Senator DeMint.
[00:27:53.612 --> 00:28:04.415]  How do we procedurally ensure that the will of the people in the House, now the override majority in the House, be able to bring this up to a vote and then audit these people?
[00:28:04.966 --> 00:28:08.328]  We need a steady drumbeat in the Senate once we get this bill through the House.
[00:28:08.328 --> 00:28:11.549]  We're not there yet, but we are going to be there soon, I think, before the end of the year.
[00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:16.772]  We're going to see a vote on this bill on the floor, and of course it will pass overwhelmingly, maybe even unanimously.
[00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:21.202]  And then that will create momentum to try to get this bill through the House.
[00:28:21.202 --> 00:28:24.643]  There's already close to 30 sponsors, sorry, in the Senate.
[00:28:24.643 --> 00:28:30.305]  There's close to 30 sponsors already in the Senate, and we need to keep up a steady drumbeat.
[00:28:30.305 --> 00:28:41.868]  When I was going around from person to person on the Democratic side of the House, signing people up to co-sponsor this bill, I often heard, oh yeah, I've had people write to me about that bill many times, but I didn't really understand it.
[00:28:42.642 --> 00:28:44.903]  We've got to do the same thing in the Senate.
[00:28:44.903 --> 00:28:45.824]  We've got to have people write.
[00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:47.125]  We've got to have people meet.
[00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:50.527]  You can call up your congressman and you can ask for a meeting with his staff.
[00:28:50.527 --> 00:28:52.688]  You can call up your senator and do the same thing.
[00:28:52.688 --> 00:28:54.329]  It doesn't even have to be in Washington.
[00:28:54.329 --> 00:28:55.250]  It can be where you live.
[00:28:55.925 --> 00:28:59.707]  Because wherever you live, there's a district office or a state office.
[00:28:59.707 --> 00:29:08.331]  And if you sit down with the staff and say, this matters so much to me, because it matters to my future, the future of my children, my grandchildren, I need to tell you about this.
[00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:11.212]  I didn't want to just send an email, I wanted to meet with somebody.
[00:29:11.212 --> 00:29:16.074]  And if you ask to speak to the staff who's in charge of financial issues, you can make an impression.
[00:29:16.074 --> 00:29:22.217]  We had people doing that over and over and over again, and it made my job to sign up co-sponsors among the Democrats much easier.
[00:29:22.873 --> 00:29:25.334]  And it's a formula that we've repeated again and again since then.
[00:29:25.334 --> 00:29:25.714]  Sure, sure.
[00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:27.634]  Congressman, we've got a break.
[00:29:27.634 --> 00:29:28.534]  It's a three minute break.
[00:29:28.534 --> 00:29:31.195]  Can you come back on the other side and do five minutes with us and finish up?
[00:29:31.195 --> 00:29:31.815]  I'm not sure.
[00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:32.595]  I'll check.
[00:29:32.595 --> 00:29:33.555]  I hope I can.
[00:29:33.555 --> 00:29:34.816]  I'll check right now.
[00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:36.956]  Congressman Alan Grayson is our guest.
[00:29:36.956 --> 00:29:40.197]  The lady he was talking about is Linda Robertson.
[00:29:40.197 --> 00:29:42.497]  She runs the big lobbying Enron firm.
[00:29:42.497 --> 00:29:47.058]  She's the chief lobbyist trying to block the Congress, the American people from investigating this group.
[00:29:47.058 --> 00:29:48.739]  We'll see if the Congressman can come back.
[00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:49.199]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.158 --> 00:29:52.560]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.084]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:57.787]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:03.900]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:09.242]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:11.283]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.283 --> 00:30:16.284]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.284 --> 00:30:17.465]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:18.585]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:20.466]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.466 --> 00:30:21.546]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.546 --> 00:30:23.747]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.747 --> 00:30:25.087]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.087 --> 00:30:26.608]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.608 --> 00:30:26.968]  If there's a
[00:30:27.028 --> 00:30:29.151]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:30:29.151 --> 00:30:31.874]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:35.459]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:39.284]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:40.526]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:41.427]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.427 --> 00:30:42.529]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:43.269]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:44.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:47.594]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.594 --> 00:30:50.437]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.437 --> 00:30:51.238]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.343]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.343 --> 00:31:13.226]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.226 --> 00:31:19.729]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.729 --> 00:31:21.530]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.151]  Yeah, fun since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:37.339]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:39.020]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.881]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.881 --> 00:31:47.084]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.774 --> 00:31:56.039]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.620]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.801]  The people strike back!
[00:32:01.172 --> 00:32:06.334]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[00:32:06.334 --> 00:32:09.836]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:32:09.836 --> 00:32:15.558]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:18.120]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.682]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[00:32:22.682 --> 00:32:25.383]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:31.568]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[00:32:31.568 --> 00:32:33.830]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:42.377]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.378]  Don't pick your nose.
[00:32:43.758 --> 00:32:48.323]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[00:32:48.323 --> 00:32:53.449]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[00:32:53.449 --> 00:32:55.190]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.413]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:59.135]  Be well and stay well.
[00:32:59.135 --> 00:32:59.876]  Best MZ!
[00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:33.677]  Congressman Grayson had to leave.
[00:33:33.677 --> 00:33:36.298]  He is going to a vote right now.
[00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:37.298]  But they are really nice.
[00:33:37.298 --> 00:33:39.378]  They said they'll try to get him back on sometime today.
[00:33:39.378 --> 00:33:45.320]  The problem is when they can have him back on is when the vote is over, when Ron Paul is on with us, coming up.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.421]  That's the problem with having congressmen on when they're in session, because it's always fluid.
[00:33:49.421 --> 00:33:53.122]  But great job to Jaron and Paul Hartman.
[00:33:54.428 --> 00:33:54.929]  We're good to go.
[00:34:07.318 --> 00:34:10.619]  Spokesperson was saying during the break, oh no, he wants to come back on and finish up today.
[00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:12.480]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.121]  Ron Paul coming up and a lot more.
[00:34:15.121 --> 00:34:16.681]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:34:16.681 --> 00:34:31.846]  And in the last hour, we're going to have reports from our reporters at the G20 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where 2,500 regular Army, regular Air Force MPs, National Guard from the Army, National Guard from the Air Force.
[00:34:31.846 --> 00:34:34.988]  We're getting confirmed reports of Marine Corps intelligence,
[00:34:36.588 --> 00:34:45.970]  Special Forces, this is all being commanded by Secret Service, above Pentagon, Delta Force, and Secret Service, as well as FBI.
[00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:50.771]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:34:50.771 --> 00:34:53.491]  So, just jam-packed, very important broadcast.
[00:34:53.491 --> 00:35:03.053]  Look, what I want to do now is get into what happened with the military last night and the police with our InfoWars reporters.
[00:35:05.015 --> 00:35:13.262]  I would really have to describe Rob Dube and Jason Douglas and Jason Burmess as Mayberry.
[00:35:13.262 --> 00:35:20.268]  They're about like the police chief and the deputy.
[00:35:20.268 --> 00:35:22.510]  They're really a mix of those two people.
[00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.371]  Nice, sweet,
[00:35:24.674 --> 00:35:27.635]  Smart, but kind of goofy.
[00:35:27.635 --> 00:35:29.256]  Just really good people.
[00:35:29.256 --> 00:35:30.557]  And let me tell you something.
[00:35:30.557 --> 00:35:34.418]  When I see the military and police trying to set up good people, it pisses me off.
[00:35:34.418 --> 00:35:36.359]  I want you to know that.
[00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:39.480]  And you may beat the rap, but you're not going to beat the ride.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:44.883]  You violate any more of their civil rights, I am going to pay to have civil rights lawsuits slapped on you personally.
[00:35:44.883 --> 00:35:47.244]  You understand me?
[00:35:47.244 --> 00:35:52.866]  You may think you can gut America like a big fat Christmas hog, and you may think trying to criminally set people up is funny.
[00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:57.576]  And you may think you're allowed to commit crimes against America, but let me tell you something.
[00:35:57.576 --> 00:36:01.220]  The people are waking up to your BS.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.863]  And it doesn't make me mad when the military and the police try to set me up.
[00:36:04.863 --> 00:36:09.187]  Strangely enough, when I get attacked, it doesn't really make me mad.
[00:36:09.187 --> 00:36:10.628]  It makes me sad for you.
[00:36:10.628 --> 00:36:14.112]  But when you start messing with my people, it makes me get hot.
[00:36:14.112 --> 00:36:17.074]  And I want you to know that.
[00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:19.957]  And I am hot with the crap you pulled.
[00:36:22.773 --> 00:36:26.114]  And I'm getting emails going, well Alex, why don't you get up there to Pittsburgh?
[00:36:26.114 --> 00:36:30.476]  I've been to urban warfare drills and takeovers.
[00:36:30.476 --> 00:36:31.637]  I don't know, I never counted it up.
[00:36:31.637 --> 00:36:33.778]  Probably twenty-something times.
[00:36:33.778 --> 00:36:35.559]  I'm finishing.
[00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:36.539]  It's got to be delivered.
[00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:37.620]  It's supposed to be delivered today.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.040]  It's going to be delivered tomorrow now.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.183]  I'm a day behind, but we'll still get it a week or so before the release date of October 21st.
[00:36:44.183 --> 00:36:45.663]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:36:45.663 --> 00:36:47.504]  This is going to reach tens of millions of people.
[00:36:47.504 --> 00:36:49.265]  My films do reach tens of millions of people.
[00:36:50.748 --> 00:36:52.132]  So that's our main operation.
[00:36:52.132 --> 00:36:55.099]  We have to run operations against the New World Order and complete them!
[00:36:56.192 --> 00:37:04.438]  If I'm aiming at one aircraft coming in firing at me and I'm in a machine gun nest, I've got to stay on it until I see its engine blow and it go down in the info war.
[00:37:04.438 --> 00:37:11.784]  I've got to continue to attack the targets in the info war and not sit there and fire one round into each of a hundred targets.
[00:37:11.784 --> 00:37:14.126]  That's why we're trying to grow our operation.
[00:37:14.126 --> 00:37:15.126]  Get more personnel.
[00:37:15.126 --> 00:37:16.167]  Try to train them.
[00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:20.390]  The problem is we've got to deal with infiltration and stuff you can't even imagine.
[00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.192]  I live in the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:31.083]  I'm going up against a global corporate takeover and we try to reach out to allies, we try to support people who are out there.
[00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:33.444]  But this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:33.444 --> 00:37:38.608]  This isn't a game of tiddlywinks.
[00:37:38.608 --> 00:37:45.973]  But yes, see I've got to sign off on the DVD menu, the video back cover, the website I want to launch tomorrow for Fall of the Republic.
[00:37:46.761 --> 00:37:57.904]  Delivering the DVD to the DVD master who's coming tomorrow to finish it this weekend and then have it mass-produced next week.
[00:37:57.904 --> 00:38:00.965]  We're doing a lot of things here, but yes, I may jump on an airplane.
[00:38:00.965 --> 00:38:06.247]  I'm obviously going to have to if they put them in jail or set them up or something.
[00:38:06.247 --> 00:38:09.928]  But the laughing cops, according to them, you know, I may not be able to ever fly again.
[00:38:09.928 --> 00:38:11.929]  It's just real funny to ruin people's lives.
[00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:15.690]  They have no conscience, no soul, they just
[00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:29.084]  Do you military and police people understand that when you go around engaging in wickedness and false witness and setting people up... So you don't believe in God.
[00:38:29.084 --> 00:38:31.226]  You don't believe in good and evil.
[00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:33.829]  And so you think you're safe doing all this evil.
[00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:35.031]  I actually fear for you.
[00:38:35.031 --> 00:38:35.932]  I feel sorry for you.
[00:38:37.108 --> 00:38:42.913]  You're gonna wonder why bad stuff happens to you and bad stuff happens to your kids and why your marriages go to hell and why you're so unhappy?
[00:38:42.913 --> 00:38:51.240]  I am so fulfilled because I do good, doesn't mean I'm perfect, that I literally, it's just a blessing.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.182]  And I want you to be good too.
[00:38:53.182 --> 00:38:54.563]  I want you to be honorable.
[00:38:54.563 --> 00:39:02.370]  You just, you have no idea what you've sold your birthright for a latrine full of cess.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:10.325]  I mean, you're not even like Cain selling his birthright for a bowl of soup.
[00:39:10.325 --> 00:39:11.687]  At least a bowl of soup was good.
[00:39:11.687 --> 00:39:18.292]  Or was it Cain or was it the other one?
[00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:18.813]  I forget.
[00:39:18.813 --> 00:39:20.895]  One of them sold his birthright.
[00:39:20.895 --> 00:39:24.758]  I just can't even handle it anymore.
[00:39:24.758 --> 00:39:28.822]  And how you guys rationalize the evil you're doing and just the whole system.
[00:39:31.462 --> 00:39:40.069]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a stack of articles here where mainstream media is announcing that they're going to kill the dollar.
[00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:47.275]  And I can't even get the general public to admit there's a world government set up, even though they're openly announcing it.
[00:39:47.275 --> 00:39:52.739]  I can't even get the general public to stop watching football for 10 minutes, enough to save themselves.
[00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:54.441]  I mean, it really is upsetting.
[00:39:56.044 --> 00:39:57.324]  I just want to do good.
[00:39:57.324 --> 00:39:59.325]  I want these foreign banks to stop raping us.
[00:39:59.325 --> 00:40:01.386]  I just want mom and apple pie.
[00:40:01.386 --> 00:40:02.766]  I want baseball.
[00:40:02.766 --> 00:40:05.407]  I want happy people.
[00:40:05.407 --> 00:40:19.211]  It freaks me out how they know the Gardasil and the Factor VIII and all these different vaccines and shots are killing people and to watch different scientists on CBC videos bragging how they knew all the polio shots have cancer viruses and kill people and laughing about it.
[00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:21.192]  I mean, it freaks me out.
[00:40:21.192 --> 00:40:21.972]  I'm freaked out.
[00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:29.192]  And then to sit there and talk to cops and military that are laughing about ruining people's lives.
[00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:34.293]  You dumb sons of bitches are being shot up full of cancer viruses, you dumb son of a bitches!
[00:40:34.293 --> 00:40:37.474]  I apologize to the listeners, I'm trying not to talk like that.
[00:40:37.474 --> 00:40:40.195]  I just, it just, what is your problem?!
[00:40:40.195 --> 00:40:44.976]  What the hell is your problem, you jackass?!
[00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:46.597]  I want something good for you!
[00:40:46.597 --> 00:40:48.697]  I want you to wake up and be good!
[00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:49.938]  And stop being evil!
[00:40:49.938 --> 00:40:51.718]  You think you're tough?!
[00:40:51.718 --> 00:40:53.499]  You think you're tough carrying out evil?! !
[00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:57.849]  Well, there are a lot more evil people above you, and they're laughing as well.
[00:40:57.849 --> 00:40:59.290]  You get off on setting us up?
[00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.871]  You get off on hurting us?
[00:41:00.871 --> 00:41:06.776]  Well, your bosses get off on shooting you full of squalene and cancer viruses, you stupid fools!
[00:41:06.776 --> 00:41:15.923]  Let me tell the 25-year-old punks and people out in your uniforms who are on power trips, and you're on a mission, and you've been trained that we're the enemy.
[00:41:15.923 --> 00:41:17.344]  You were literally put into a trance.
[00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:18.625]  You were slowly brought into it.
[00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:20.910]  Let me tell you something.
[00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:35.873]  When you're 40 years old with cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, when you got blood coming out your butt, when you're sitting there with your teeth falling out, and when you die, as you at least ask God to forgive you, because it can happen, just like the thief on the cross.
[00:41:35.873 --> 00:41:37.794]  And I'm serious.
[00:41:37.794 --> 00:41:45.375]  Keep a small, soft area in your heart, so that at least you don't lose your soul when you're sitting there weighing 75 pounds on that gurney.
[00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:46.856]  You think you're big and bad at 240 pounds right now.
[00:41:48.663 --> 00:41:56.747]  When you're sitting there fighting for breath, at least admit we were right and repent, you bastards!
[00:41:56.747 --> 00:42:03.311]  Because let me tell you something, you haven't seen what I've seen and you haven't looked into the mind of the system you're serving.
[00:42:03.311 --> 00:42:08.373]  I've been studying this for almost, well more than 16 years, but on the air for almost 14.
[00:42:08.373 --> 00:42:11.475]  And I have gained a knowledge of this, and let me tell you something,
[00:42:12.648 --> 00:42:14.810]  You don't have any idea what real evil is.
[00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:15.790]  You think it's tough.
[00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:16.771]  You think it's sexy.
[00:42:16.771 --> 00:42:18.212]  You think it's cute.
[00:42:18.212 --> 00:42:19.833]  You think it's cute to torture people.
[00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:26.598]  You think it's cute to shoot families and watch them blow apart and shoot their cars up in Baghdad and laugh at the dead kids rolling out.
[00:42:26.598 --> 00:42:30.700]  You dumb bastards!
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.664]  And you wrap yourselves in the flag.
[00:42:35.664 --> 00:42:38.306]  You have no idea what you're part of.
[00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:45.475]  You have no idea what you have now dove into, the water you're in.
[00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:50.458]  You have no idea what's swimming in there with you, if you could only know.
[00:42:50.458 --> 00:42:54.801]  And you can if you study this and ask God to give you discernment.
[00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:58.024]  But let me tell you, be ready.
[00:42:58.024 --> 00:43:04.188]  Because every time I start talking about this and thinking about this, I get chills all over my body.
[00:43:04.188 --> 00:43:05.249]  I got chills right now.
[00:43:09.335 --> 00:43:10.855]  A lot of you are already walking dead.
[00:43:10.855 --> 00:43:14.796]  I've seen no group that they shoot up worse than the troops.
[00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:21.158]  They shoot you up with soft kills and if you don't know what a soft kill is or a binary weapon, you better find out quick.
[00:43:21.158 --> 00:43:26.059]  And you better try to detox yourself now before the damage continues.
[00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:32.501]  God, I wish you knew.
[00:43:32.501 --> 00:43:33.181]  I'm gonna cover
[00:43:34.548 --> 00:43:51.416]  When we start the next hour, the police state control grid and what happened to our people are going to be on with us in the last hour today.
[00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:54.998]  I'm going to cover it all.
[00:43:54.998 --> 00:43:59.340]  But I first want to play this clip of Senator Feingold, who's certainly not perfect.
[00:44:02.236 --> 00:44:06.458]  But he really does tell the truth about sneak-and-peek searches being used for irregular crimes.
[00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:21.807]  Now, when he's talking to one of the government lawyers in this hearing, the government lawyer is saying, well, the senator, you notice, is saying, well, the sneak-and-peek, sneaking in people's houses, has been used in non-terror related.
[00:44:21.807 --> 00:44:24.689]  And the guy goes, well, of course, the statute was written that it's non-terror.
[00:44:26.434 --> 00:44:30.858]  And Feingold goes, yeah, but it was sold as for terror.
[00:44:30.858 --> 00:44:33.059]  I wrote the analysis of Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:44:33.059 --> 00:44:36.602]  I won 2nd place, or was it 3rd place?
[00:44:36.602 --> 00:44:36.982]  I forget.
[00:44:36.982 --> 00:44:39.644]  It was 2nd place for the Project Censored Awards.
[00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:40.805]  They have 25 places.
[00:44:40.805 --> 00:44:42.587]  Pretty big deal from Sonoma State University.
[00:44:42.587 --> 00:44:45.389]  Did I win that in 2002?
[00:44:47.807 --> 00:44:50.188]  I don't know, it was on Free Speech TV, I went out there and gave a speech.
[00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:52.029]  It's in Matrix of Evil.
[00:44:52.029 --> 00:45:06.515]  But the point is, is I'm no lawyer, but I understand this stuff, and I spent several days reading the bill, and I wrote the analysis, and I went to Section 213, and it says for any crime, any investigation, any misdemeanor, we break in your house without warrants and spy on you.
[00:45:06.515 --> 00:45:11.657]  And they have snatch and grab provisions in Patriot Act 2, and they have, and Section 802,
[00:45:14.548 --> 00:45:25.684]  States that the Patriot Act can be used for any misdemeanor, any crime that violates any federal or state law that endangers human life.
[00:45:25.684 --> 00:45:26.245]  I mean, go read it!
[00:45:27.486 --> 00:45:35.188]  They changed the definition from threatening violence or carrying out violence for political aim or taking hostages, you know, the classic definition.
[00:45:35.188 --> 00:45:38.549]  And it strikes those and says, all misdemeanors.
[00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:55.693]  And then the feds tried to pass in Washington State and Rhode Island, just two places, and it came out in the news that when the state senators and governors would get in trouble when people read the bills, they'd say, well, the feds asked me to pass this, and it was a copy of the Patriot Act, but it said, if you protest, life in prison and a forced labor camp.
[00:45:57.023 --> 00:46:02.087]  If you desecrate the American flag, including having it on cups or napkins, life in prison, forced labor camp.
[00:46:02.087 --> 00:46:04.089]  You can go read the bills.
[00:46:04.089 --> 00:46:10.514]  It said if you intimidate a state or federal official, if you protest them, life in prison, forced labor camp.
[00:46:10.514 --> 00:46:13.256]  It says forced labor camp.
[00:46:13.256 --> 00:46:16.719]  One of them was Senator's menace bill, it almost passed, that was in the Oregonian and AP.
[00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:19.441]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:25.106]  So I knew all this, but I want you to know it's a hundred times worse than Senator Feingold is saying here.
[00:46:25.106 --> 00:46:25.967]  This thing says
[00:46:27.196 --> 00:46:29.478]  All misdemeanors are an act of terrorism.
[00:46:29.478 --> 00:46:33.801]  So see, you can go find articles from every major state.
[00:46:33.801 --> 00:46:35.622]  Just search the term Patriot Act.
[00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:40.750]  Used for regular crimes or non-terror issues.
[00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:42.231]  And you'll see different states.
[00:46:42.231 --> 00:46:49.736]  I've seen headlines like, 20 plus thousand people had the Patriot Act used on them for drunk driving and marijuana crimes.
[00:46:49.736 --> 00:46:51.817]  Or CPS using Patriot Act.
[00:46:51.817 --> 00:46:53.898]  The thing was written for you.
[00:46:53.898 --> 00:46:58.781]  Homeland Security was written for you.
[00:46:58.781 --> 00:47:02.924]  Everything was written for the American people.
[00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:05.490]  Everything!
[00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:14.254]  The DHS report, gun owners, veterans, liberals, conservatives, libertarians, Bob Barr supporters, Ron Paul supporters, anyone who protests the Fed.
[00:47:14.254 --> 00:47:20.677]  We got the secret Army documents, then it became mainstream news that the Army watches Ron Paul, his brother, me.
[00:47:20.677 --> 00:47:23.018]  I told you I've had the Army follow me around for years.
[00:47:23.018 --> 00:47:26.940]  They've threatened me in parking lots.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.342]  And you know, when these guys come up and get in my face twice, block my car in,
[00:47:32.236 --> 00:47:35.138]  And they're there, special forces types.
[00:47:35.138 --> 00:47:38.960]  These aren't just your average stupid, you know, dumbed-down weekend warriors.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.842]  I'm not saying you're bad, but you know what I mean, kind of doe-eyed, not knowing what's going on.
[00:47:42.842 --> 00:47:47.045]  They're predatory, they think they're tough, they're into being into precision, they're into their mission.
[00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:51.207]  They wear a uniform, they attack enemies, and they're now in America.
[00:47:51.207 --> 00:47:53.749]  And they let me know, we're watching your ass.
[00:47:53.749 --> 00:47:55.710]  You ever try anything violent, we're gonna get you.
[00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.131]  And I'm like, what the hell is your problem?
[00:47:58.038 --> 00:48:02.920]  And in both cases, I said, go take some more vaccines and get out of my face.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.581]  I feel sorry for you.
[00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:05.041]  And I do.
[00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:06.482]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:48:06.482 --> 00:48:08.162]  You think you're so tough.
[00:48:08.162 --> 00:48:10.163]  You think you know what power is.
[00:48:10.163 --> 00:48:12.584]  You think you know what evil is, little boys.
[00:48:12.584 --> 00:48:13.505]  And you don't!
[00:48:13.505 --> 00:48:16.846]  You don't have the mental strength to defend the Republic.
[00:48:16.846 --> 00:48:18.447]  You don't have the mental strength.
[00:48:18.447 --> 00:48:25.370]  You are in an adolescent child psychology arrested development where you like being patted on the head by the big guys in the uniforms.
[00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.191]  You like being sent out like hunting dogs.
[00:48:28.399 --> 00:48:41.475]  Sociologists, psychologists, and many statesmen have pointed out for thousands of years that it takes more courage to go against the PAC, and against authorities, and against your bosses, just like the German soldiers followed orders, and the high command followed orders.
[00:48:41.475 --> 00:48:47.243]  It takes more courage to say no to illegal and unlawful crap than it does to charge Machine Gun Nest.
[00:48:48.827 --> 00:48:51.409]  You want to have real courage?
[00:48:51.409 --> 00:48:55.152]  I know I'm telling the truth, and I know I'm right about what I'm covering.
[00:48:55.152 --> 00:49:01.036]  And if you just look at what I'm claiming, you'd find out I'm the best friend you ever had!
[00:49:01.036 --> 00:49:06.960]  And I'm sick of the death threats, and I'm sick of your baloney!
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.201]  Oh, I know you're tough.
[00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:09.482]  You've killed a bunch of people.
[00:49:09.482 --> 00:49:12.864]  Why, you've gone out and carried out assassinations in third world countries.
[00:49:12.864 --> 00:49:14.245]  Big deal!
[00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:17.287]  It's easy to pull the trigger on somebody.
[00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:17.668]  Easy!
[00:49:18.775 --> 00:49:21.659]  I pulled the trigger on a lot of people with my fist!
[00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:24.042]  And it doesn't mean I'm proud of it!
[00:49:24.042 --> 00:49:26.465]  I'm beating people's brains out!
[00:49:26.465 --> 00:49:27.526]  What does that mean?
[00:49:27.526 --> 00:49:29.628]  It doesn't mean anything!
[00:49:29.628 --> 00:49:30.690]  I'm ashamed of it!
[00:49:33.373 --> 00:49:36.134]  You wanna be all John Wayne macho?
[00:49:36.134 --> 00:49:38.795]  They programmed you with cartoons with G.I.
[00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:40.095]  Joe, all psych warfare.
[00:49:40.095 --> 00:49:41.716]  Go watch it now.
[00:49:41.716 --> 00:49:43.377]  All predictive programming.
[00:49:43.377 --> 00:49:45.197]  And you're following that programming.
[00:49:45.197 --> 00:49:47.098]  You follow it when they sh... You know what?
[00:49:47.098 --> 00:49:50.139]  They know that when you're 45 or 50, you're gonna wake up.
[00:49:50.139 --> 00:49:53.860]  That's why you've got cancer viruses that are connected to your hormone levels.
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:58.002]  And as soon as your testosterone level starts dropping, pal, you're gonna die of cancer.
[00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:00.832]  You like that?
[00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:01.652]  You think that's funny?
[00:50:01.652 --> 00:50:02.972]  Then go ahead and laugh!
[00:50:02.972 --> 00:50:04.473]  And go ahead and kill me!
[00:50:04.473 --> 00:50:09.675]  Because you've already killed yourselves, you dumb pieces of trash!
[00:50:09.675 --> 00:50:12.256]  And you know deep in your gut, you're hearing Veritas.
[00:50:12.256 --> 00:50:17.858]  You're hearing truth directly from a red-blooded American and a red-blooded Texan!
[00:50:17.858 --> 00:50:20.099]  I will not dishonor my family in their name!
[00:50:21.232 --> 00:50:23.453]  My family on the Mayflower!
[00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.633]  My family in 1776!
[00:50:25.633 --> 00:50:28.334]  My family in Texas Independence!
[00:50:28.334 --> 00:50:30.394]  I will never disgrace my family!
[00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:33.275]  And I will never disgrace my people!
[00:50:33.275 --> 00:50:37.676]  And I will never be with you cowards, and you scum, and you traitors!
[00:50:37.676 --> 00:50:38.896]  Do you understand me?
[00:50:38.896 --> 00:50:40.257]  I rebuke you!
[00:50:41.823 --> 00:50:52.228]  If you got any soul left, you ought to hit your knees like Saul of Tarsus and be transformed into true warriors for liberty and freedom that you were meant to be!
[00:50:52.228 --> 00:50:56.750]  It tears my guts out to see you fall to evil!
[00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.570]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.571]  I'm going to play the Patriot Act clip when we return.
[00:51:00.512 --> 00:51:02.695]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:51:02.695 --> 00:51:03.556]  Spy on me?
[00:51:03.556 --> 00:51:03.877]  Yeah.
[00:51:03.877 --> 00:51:08.923]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:51:08.923 --> 00:51:10.545]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:51:10.545 --> 00:51:11.286]  Startpage?
[00:51:11.286 --> 00:51:11.707]  Yeah.
[00:51:11.707 --> 00:51:12.808]  Startpage.com.
[00:51:12.808 --> 00:51:15.572]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:51:15.752 --> 00:51:19.633]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:51:19.633 --> 00:51:22.754]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:51:22.754 --> 00:51:25.374]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:26.975]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:51:26.975 --> 00:51:27.275]  Right!
[00:51:27.275 --> 00:51:30.596]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:51:30.596 --> 00:51:32.516]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:32.516 --> 00:51:36.017]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:51:36.377 --> 00:51:40.159]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:51:40.159 --> 00:51:45.302]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:48.704]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the big brother habit.
[00:51:48.704 --> 00:51:50.465]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:51:50.465 --> 00:51:54.748]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:51:54.748 --> 00:52:00.711]  That's StartPage.com.
[00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:03.193]  It is a big idea.
[00:52:03.193 --> 00:52:04.954]  A new world order.
[00:52:04.954 --> 00:52:05.494]  In the near future.
[00:52:06.753 --> 00:52:09.434]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:09.434 --> 00:52:12.656]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:52:12.656 --> 00:52:15.437]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:15.437 --> 00:52:18.618]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:18.618 --> 00:52:28.983]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:28.983 --> 00:52:33.925]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.281]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.281 --> 00:52:40.842]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward the world, Charlie.
[00:52:40.842 --> 00:52:42.022]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.022 --> 00:52:42.803]  They're not after money.
[00:52:42.803 --> 00:52:44.083]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.083 --> 00:52:45.063]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.063 --> 00:52:46.204]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:52:46.204 --> 00:52:54.927]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:54.927 --> 00:52:55.687]  Endgame.
[00:52:55.687 --> 00:52:57.728]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:52:57.728 --> 00:52:58.868]  You have been warned.
[00:52:59.705 --> 00:53:06.407]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:53:06.407 --> 00:53:08.088]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[00:53:08.088 --> 00:53:12.669]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:53:12.669 --> 00:53:20.331]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:22.812]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[00:53:22.972 --> 00:53:23.272]  I think?
[00:53:43.541 --> 00:53:44.662]  I was sitting in traffic
[00:54:12.102 --> 00:54:24.073]  Chris, let me start by reiterating something you and I have talked about previously, and that's my concern that critical information about the implementation of the Patriot Act has not been made public.
[00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:27.396]  Information that I believe would have a significant impact on the debate.
[00:54:27.396 --> 00:54:35.443]  I urge you to move expeditiously on the request that I and others in this committee have made before the legislative process is over.
[00:54:36.314 --> 00:54:48.397]  Now in Suzanne Spaulding's testimony for the next panel, she argues that additional safeguards are needed in the context of intelligence investigations because of the very broad scope of intelligence investigations.
[00:54:48.397 --> 00:54:55.239]  The secrecy with which they must be conducted and the fact that they often do not lead to prosecution.
[00:54:55.239 --> 00:54:59.940]  That is, we have to take into account that safeguards inherent to criminal investigations
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:00.900]  Yes.
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:00.960]  Yes.
[00:55:20.874 --> 00:55:26.697]  Well, I think the problems that Mr. Fine found are significant.
[00:55:26.697 --> 00:55:27.958]  I think they've been remedied.
[00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:37.063]  I'm not sure that those are inherent in an intelligence use of NSLs, but I mean certainly they are significant and they warrant attention and I think they've gotten a lot of attention.
[00:55:37.063 --> 00:55:42.026]  Mr. Fine, would you agree that the lack of safeguards contributed to the misuse of NSLs?
[00:55:42.026 --> 00:55:49.710]  I think to some extent the fact that they were not transparent does produce an environment where there needs to be more significant vigilance.
[00:55:50.558 --> 00:56:03.730]  Mr. Riss, as you know, the Patriot Act provided statutory authority for the government to obtain special sneak-and-peek criminal search warrants that allow agents to break into Americans' homes and conduct secret searches without telling them for weeks, months, or even longer.
[00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:12.138]  It is true, isn't it, that these searches can be conducted also in run-of-the-mill criminal cases and do not require any connection to terrorism?
[00:56:13.408 --> 00:56:18.934]  That's true, both before... In fact, according to a July 2009 report of the Administrative Office of the U.S.
[00:56:18.934 --> 00:56:22.698]  Courts, isn't that exactly how this authority has most recently been used?
[00:56:22.698 --> 00:56:34.751]  The report shows that in fiscal year 2008, sneak and peek search warrants were requested 763 times, but only three of those initial requests, just three, were in terrorism cases.
[00:56:35.745 --> 00:56:38.347]  The vast majority were for drug cases.
[00:56:38.347 --> 00:56:42.150]  Now is that your understanding of that report and does it concern you at all?
[00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:50.176]  It is my understanding and I want to say thank you to your staff who alerted me and allowed me to read the report in advance of this hearing.
[00:56:50.176 --> 00:56:57.021]  It does say here that sixty five percent of the, these are criminal sneak and peek, were in drug cases.
[00:56:57.021 --> 00:57:00.884]  Obviously just to make something clear which I know you understand, on the FISA side
[00:57:01.624 --> 00:57:05.929]  The searches that we do pursuant to FISA are not exactly sneak and peek.
[00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:08.332]  They're generally covert altogether.
[00:57:08.332 --> 00:57:15.200]  So this authority here on the sneak and peek side, on the criminal side, is not meant for intelligence.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.562]  It's for criminal cases.
[00:57:18.443 --> 00:57:21.824]  I guess it's not surprising to me that it applies in drug cases.
[00:57:21.824 --> 00:57:30.226]  I recall it was in something called the USA Patriot Act, which was passed in a rush after an attack on 9-11 that had to do with terrorism.
[00:57:30.226 --> 00:57:33.386]  It didn't have to do with regular run-of-the-mill criminal cases.
[00:57:33.386 --> 00:57:35.667]  Let me tell you why I'm concerned about these numbers.
[00:57:35.667 --> 00:57:39.287]  That's not how this was sold to the American people.
[00:57:39.287 --> 00:57:46.629]  It was sold as stated on DOJ's website in 2005 as being necessary, quote, to conduct investigations without tipping off terrorists.
[00:57:47.961 --> 00:57:55.749]  I'm going to say it's quite extraordinary to grant government agents the statutory authority to secretly break into Americans' homes in criminal cases.
[00:57:55.749 --> 00:58:01.815]  And I think some Americans might be concerned that it's been used hundreds of times in just a single year in non-terrorism cases.
[00:58:01.815 --> 00:58:07.842]  And that's why I'm proposing additional safeguards to make sure that this authority is available where necessary.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:14.548]  But not in virtually every criminal case, and also to shorten the time period for notification.
[00:58:14.548 --> 00:58:15.790]  Well, I don't mean to quibble with you.
[00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:25.503]  I do want to just point out one thing, which is, I mean, before when I was trying to carve out FISA, just to clarify that FISA is a different authority where it is covert.
[00:58:26.184 --> 00:58:33.506]  And also, if I'm correct on this, I believe two courts of appeals prior to the Patriot Act had authorized sneak and peek under existing law.
[00:58:33.506 --> 00:58:36.287]  This was, I think, meant to be a codification of that document.
[00:58:36.287 --> 00:58:36.687]  There you go.
[00:58:36.687 --> 00:58:39.568]  That's like saying Hitler was killing people, so it's okay.
[00:58:39.568 --> 00:58:45.690]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.691]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.384 --> 00:58:54.628]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.628 --> 00:58:56.630]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.630 --> 00:59:05.159]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.159 --> 00:59:10.704]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.704 --> 00:59:12.326]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.566 --> 00:59:19.068]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.068 --> 00:59:30.130]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:30.891]  That's right.
[00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:33.451]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.451 --> 00:59:35.052]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.992 --> 00:59:37.452]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.517 --> 01:00:08.298]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.298 --> 01:00:10.040]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.621]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:13.202]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.202 --> 01:00:17.385]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.385 --> 01:00:21.428]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:41.911]  Scores of mainline publications are reporting that the G20 will be meeting secretly, not just in their public press conferences, today and tomorrow, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to discuss the end of the dollar.
[01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:51.838]  Dollar under scrutiny at G20 summit, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, French news agency AFP.
[01:00:51.838 --> 01:00:56.100]  Another headline here, out of the Huffington Post, secret White House letter to G20,
[01:00:57.549 --> 01:01:00.810]  Another headline here out of the London Telegraph.
[01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:04.471]  HSBC bids farewell to dollar supremacy.
[01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:05.851]  The sun is setting on the U.S.
[01:01:05.851 --> 01:01:08.972]  dollar at the ultra-loose monetary policy of the U.S.
[01:01:08.972 --> 01:01:18.614]  Federal Reserve forced China and vibrant economies of the emerging world to forge a new global currency order, according to a new report by one of the biggest banks in the world.
[01:01:18.614 --> 01:01:23.495]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what it's going to mean when they take away the dollar?
[01:01:24.235 --> 01:01:27.037]  We don't have any industry left to speak of.
[01:01:27.037 --> 01:01:28.999]  We're only a service economy.
[01:01:28.999 --> 01:01:36.686]  All the crud we buy from foreign nations is as bad as our standard of living has fallen.
[01:01:36.686 --> 01:01:41.170]  Do you know what's going to happen when they kill the dollar incrementally over the next few years?
[01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:42.951]  Do you know what's going to happen?
[01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:44.513]  We're going to be like Argentina.
[01:01:44.513 --> 01:01:45.974]  All the top economists are saying it.
[01:01:47.318 --> 01:01:49.959]  You know what this means for our country?
[01:01:49.959 --> 01:01:56.843]  And the establishment planned all this, just like you heard the Congressman earlier saying the banks are doing this by design to consolidate power.
[01:01:56.843 --> 01:02:02.666]  That's Congressman Grayson, Harvard-educated lawyer and economist.
[01:02:02.666 --> 01:02:07.488]  We got another economist, Dr. Ron Paul, joining us, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:02:07.488 --> 01:02:10.250]  I mean, do you know what all of this means?
[01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.171]  Do you know it's all happening?
[01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:16.093]  The world government is now forming, and I send my three reporters
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:33.730]  I send them there to try to go talk to the Army's Press Secretary, which is normal and customary, and they say, get out of here, we're not going to talk to you, and then they call a false report into the police saying they were out there sneaking around the perimeter, wouldn't give them ID, and ran.
[01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:37.252]  Total lie!
[01:02:37.252 --> 01:02:39.814]  I was on the phone with them trying to give the phone to the military.
[01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.612]  This is how America operates.
[01:02:43.612 --> 01:02:45.693]  They just lie out of hand.
[01:02:45.693 --> 01:02:57.383]  It's like the New York police on video in Truth Rising with Luke Grodowski coming up saying, stop protesting, I don't care if you have a permit or allowed to be here, we're going to say your backpack's a bomb and your camera's a gun.
[01:02:57.383 --> 01:03:03.848]  And they call uniformed cops over and the cops grab the camera and say we're detaining you for this being a gun and laugh at them.
[01:03:03.848 --> 01:03:04.589]  On video!
[01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:05.990]  They didn't even erase it!
[01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.392]  They don't care if they're on video framing people.
[01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:14.482]  I mean, God help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:14.482 --> 01:03:16.142]  They train the police how to lie.
[01:03:16.142 --> 01:03:22.423]  They train the military now how to engage the American people on how to lie, and how to frame people out of hand.
[01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:28.924]  We have a red alert up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a hurried report I wrote last night at about midnight.
[01:03:28.924 --> 01:03:33.125]  Then we then added the email from my guys from their Pittsburgh PA hotel room at the bottom.
[01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:37.946]  Red alert, military attempts to frame InfoWars reporters for terrorism at G20 Summit.
[01:03:37.946 --> 01:03:39.926]  I'm going to cover this in detail.
[01:03:40.933 --> 01:03:48.278]  When we come back.
[01:03:48.278 --> 01:03:54.263]  But heaven, help us with what this nation has turned into.
[01:03:54.263 --> 01:04:01.268]  Heaven, help this country.
[01:04:01.268 --> 01:04:04.330]  And I am just so overwhelmed by all of this, I can hardly
[01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.637]  Even sit here on the radio.
[01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:13.861]  It's so overwhelming, it's almost abnormal to even sit here and calmly talk about it.
[01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:23.468]  It's just mind-blowing that this many people in government engage in pure evil and false witness like it's nothing!
[01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:24.489]  Like it's nothing!
[01:04:25.748 --> 01:04:30.069]  Don't you understand that laws and freedom and liberty protects you?
[01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:40.532]  Don't you understand that when you start going along with evil, your society turns into hell overnight and your children have no future?
[01:04:40.532 --> 01:04:42.753]  They have bathed us in evil and corruption.
[01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.973]  We are becoming a totally wicked system.
[01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:47.874]  We're rotting like a fish from the head down.
[01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:55.775]  We're gonna come back and break down all of this and a lot of other key news on the economy and world government openly being announced.
[01:04:55.775 --> 01:05:00.439]  They're killing the dollar right now and the military's busy trying to frame good Americans.
[01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:05.743]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.743 --> 01:05:07.824]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:05:07.824 --> 01:05:10.286]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.286 --> 01:05:12.548]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:03.721]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?

[01:06:07.343 --> 01:06:11.925]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.925 --> 01:06:17.528]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:22.571]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:26.194]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:01.734]  You worry.
[01:07:01.734 --> 01:07:03.795]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:07:03.795 --> 01:07:06.435]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:08.556]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:10.176]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:07:10.176 --> 01:07:13.757]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:07:13.757 --> 01:07:18.998]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:07:18.998 --> 01:07:22.978]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:07:22.978 --> 01:07:24.659]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:07:24.659 --> 01:07:27.559]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:07:27.559 --> 01:07:30.500]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:07:31.024 --> 01:07:39.666]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:44.486]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:07:44.486 --> 01:07:48.487]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:07:54.328 --> 01:07:57.729]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:07:57.729 --> 01:07:59.749]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:08:01.102 --> 01:08:03.844]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.844 --> 01:08:16.133]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:22.258]  Becoming quite fashionable to attack the Federal Reserve, Sarah Palin on her trip to Hong Kong did.
[01:08:22.258 --> 01:08:24.580]  You see, we've now identified the real government.
[01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:36.782]  And Republicans and Democrats, the leadership, are nothing but pawns they play, a projection they put up in our face to distract us and divert us from the real actions and the true halls of power that are taking place.
[01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:46.476]  And that's why the Federal Reserve has trained the military and police and put out DHS and state reports saying that if you criticize the Federal Reserve, you're a terrorist.
[01:08:46.476 --> 01:08:59.026]  That's why the Defense Department and the Justice Department, mainstream news from a month ago, have put out reports saying all protest is a form of quote, low-level terrorism.
[01:08:59.026 --> 01:09:06.611]  And they teach the military and the police to cross-train together all over the country, that anybody protesting is a terrorist.
[01:09:06.611 --> 01:09:06.972]  And then,
[01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:15.656]  In Seattle in 99, in Denver in 2008, in Canada in 2008, in Ottawa, there's many other examples.
[01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:26.707]  In England at the G20 this year, it came out mainstream news that the police dressed up like anarchists, knocked out windows, attacked other police officers that didn't even know what was happening.
[01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.789]  The commanders did and ordered the police
[01:09:29.429 --> 01:09:33.132]  The riot police to stand down while bottles and rocks are hitting them.
[01:09:33.132 --> 01:09:38.276]  And while police, dressed up like anarchists, run up and hit them on the head with rocks.
[01:09:38.276 --> 01:09:53.227]  Now, when you watch these videos, we're always able to point out that they're fake, that it's staged, and then later it comes out that it's staged in the mainstream news, in the Toronto Sun, Toronto Star, excuse me, in the Denver Post, in the Seattle Post-Intelligence, or in the Seattle Times.
[01:09:53.227 --> 01:09:54.648]  These are all mainstream news articles.
[01:09:55.569 --> 01:10:06.557]  But I can always watch the video before it comes out two or three weeks later that Royal Mountain Police apologize and are investigating who ordered their police to dress up like anarchists and attack other police.
[01:10:06.557 --> 01:10:12.081]  Denver Police Department is investigating who ordered their police to dress up like anarchists and attack other police.
[01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:12.541]  Yeah, right.
[01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.442]  Investigating themselves.
[01:10:14.602 --> 01:10:21.366]  But I was able to look at the video in Ottawa and go, look, the anarchists are all wearing police boots with the same yellow logo on the heel.
[01:10:21.366 --> 01:10:22.366]  These are big guys.
[01:10:22.366 --> 01:10:25.648]  These aren't little anarchist meth heads, the real ones.
[01:10:25.648 --> 01:10:27.810]  I'm not saying you're all like that, but you know what I'm talking about.
[01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:31.011]  Anybody who's been at these protests has faced meth heads.
[01:10:31.011 --> 01:10:36.375]  These are big guys and they're running up and hitting, you know, it's like pro wrestling.
[01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:37.675]  They put on a big show.
[01:10:37.675 --> 01:10:43.879]  They're hitting them hard, but the hand slows down right when they hit the cop on the head with a rock on the riot helmet.
[01:10:45.348 --> 01:10:49.932]  It's like watching Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant when they're fake stomping each other in the face.
[01:10:49.932 --> 01:10:51.092]  It's totally fake.
[01:10:51.092 --> 01:10:58.598]  And I go, okay, those are all big guys, big cops, same boots, and they're not really hitting those police hard.
[01:10:58.598 --> 01:11:04.102]  Now in Seattle, they actually broke a cop's nose with a bottle, because that was the army was running that.
[01:11:04.102 --> 01:11:06.164]  They had very hardcore operators doing that.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.142]  And the cops were like getting really mad saying, why can't we defend ourselves?
[01:11:10.142 --> 01:11:12.543]  And the commanders were like, stand down, stand down.
[01:11:12.543 --> 01:11:21.028]  And the police are in my film, Police State 2, The Takeover, going, yeah, we were ordered to stand there and watch as they looted Nike Town and attacked us.
[01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:25.831]  And it came out that it was, it was, it was feds.
[01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:29.974]  When it's cops attacking cops, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like pro wrestling.
[01:11:29.974 --> 01:11:32.075]  And you'll see the cops when they're getting kicked or hit, uh,
[01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:38.149]  Like, putting their hands out, like, why are you doing this?
[01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:41.777]  You know, the universal sign language for questioning.
[01:11:44.793 --> 01:11:52.038]  And we confirmed in Denver ourselves, and we said on air we had suspicions, that we talked to a bunch of media.
[01:11:52.038 --> 01:11:53.639]  Media at like 6 a.m.
[01:11:53.639 --> 01:12:00.043]  at this square right by the Capitol, different radio stations that were interviewing us, local talk.
[01:12:00.043 --> 01:12:03.665]  We would go down there at 8, 9 o'clock different mornings and be interviewed by them.
[01:12:03.665 --> 01:12:06.027]  That was kind of the center of the protest.
[01:12:06.027 --> 01:12:09.489]  And I was told by local news reporters, they said, yeah, no, we saw Marines
[01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:20.059]  Get out of their car, get out of white vans, and change clothes in the vans, in and out of the vans, and then run off and join Anarchist.
[01:12:21.673 --> 01:12:24.434]  And then Luke Rodowski was another protest.
[01:12:24.434 --> 01:12:27.135]  We were in the RV driving around and missed it.
[01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:29.235]  But he said, yeah, it looked like it was fake.
[01:12:29.235 --> 01:12:34.276]  These big guys dressed like anarchists were coming up, yelling and screaming, hitting cops and pushing police.
[01:12:34.276 --> 01:12:40.578]  And that ended up being on Fox News the day before the official Democratic National Convention started for four days.
[01:12:40.578 --> 01:12:41.358]  That was on the Monday.
[01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.759]  Or was it a Sunday?
[01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:44.859]  I forget.
[01:12:44.859 --> 01:12:49.801]  And we said it looked like it was provocateur watching Fox News on the video and then looking at Luke's video.
[01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:50.701]  But we couldn't prove it.
[01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:56.364]  Because the anarchists will attack and then slip behind a police line and the cops stop you.
[01:12:56.364 --> 01:13:00.647]  But then it came out, that was staged, that first event.
[01:13:00.647 --> 01:13:09.273]  To show the demonstrators as violent and bad, to set the precedent to say, well that's why we got 2,500 troops, that's why we got tens of thousands of police.
[01:13:09.273 --> 01:13:21.301]  And we've got our teams on the ground, three people split up, surveilling the anarchists, surveilling the Incredible Hulk anarchists, as I call them, you know, the cops dressed up.
[01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:50.308]  And I know that there's over 60 plus activists from the different change groups and 9-11 truth groups, when I say 60, that's a conservative number, that are there on the ground, in hotels, in condo balconies, on the street, in taxis, in buses, and I've told everybody, just, when you see anarchists bust out a window or do something, don't point your cameras directly at them, I mean, film them while they're doing it, and then quietly follow them.
[01:13:51.058 --> 01:14:00.401]  Because you will follow them back to a police station or back to a foundation-funded, bivouacked warehouse or facility, and then we've got them.
[01:14:00.401 --> 01:14:02.781]  And we're now starting to catch them because we know their tactics.
[01:14:02.781 --> 01:14:11.144]  And I called the police department in Pittsburgh last night and I told them, I said, I know you're involved in this, and they were kind of shooken up by it, and I said, we are surveilling you.
[01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:13.777]  For criminal activity.
[01:14:13.777 --> 01:14:16.000]  So it kind of defeats our purpose.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.844]  If we were really trying to bust them, we wouldn't let them know we're watching.
[01:14:18.844 --> 01:14:21.727]  But we don't want them to be able to demonize the protesters.
[01:14:21.727 --> 01:14:23.009]  And so we do things moral.
[01:14:23.009 --> 01:14:24.571]  We let them know we're coming.
[01:14:24.571 --> 01:14:26.774]  We let them know we're coming, what we're going to be doing.
[01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:30.197]  And we just stand in the light and trust in God.
[01:14:30.197 --> 01:14:45.827]  And I want you to pray for Jason Bermas, Rob Dew, and Jason Douglas that are on the ground from the Infowars team there, and all the We Are Change people, and everybody else that are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the G20, as open world government and the end of the dollar is being announced in mainstream newspapers.
[01:14:45.827 --> 01:14:47.308]  I just read the headlines earlier.
[01:14:47.308 --> 01:14:49.450]  I'm going to go back through those articles in a little while.
[01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.131]  We're 15 minutes away from Ron Paul.
[01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:55.434]  He may move the interview, though, because they're in a vote right now.
[01:14:55.434 --> 01:14:57.195]  We need to double check that if he's still voting.
[01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:04.212]  Okay, here is the really big news of the day.
[01:15:04.212 --> 01:15:04.912]  Red alert!
[01:15:04.912 --> 01:15:15.157]  Military attempts to frame InfoWars reporters for terrorism at G20 Summit.
[01:15:15.157 --> 01:15:16.697]  I got a call about 10 p.m.
[01:15:16.697 --> 01:15:17.998]  last night from Jason Douglas.
[01:15:17.998 --> 01:15:22.520]  He said, I just got called by a guy saying he was with the Army and FBI.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.482]  Well, first they called and said they were with Alamo Rental and that the car's brakes were out.
[01:15:30.051 --> 01:15:34.153]  That's gotta break laws, the police to call up and say they're with another company.
[01:15:34.153 --> 01:15:41.015]  They got the license plate, found out where it was, called, got the cell phone on the rent car, call up and say, Hi, I'm with Alamo Rental.
[01:15:41.015 --> 01:15:42.335]  My name's Tom Watson.
[01:15:42.335 --> 01:15:44.876]  That's the police officer that admitted he did this.
[01:15:44.876 --> 01:15:46.657]  He did the investigator.
[01:15:46.657 --> 01:15:49.778]  And we'd like you to bring that car back over here.
[01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.559]  And we'll give you two free days, but the brakes are out.
[01:15:52.284 --> 01:15:57.467]  And then Douglas said, well, they've already cordoned off the downtown area, which they just locked down right as they got back through it.
[01:15:57.467 --> 01:15:59.368]  And he said, I'll have to bring it in tomorrow.
[01:15:59.368 --> 01:16:02.869]  And the guy just changed and said, look, you're in a terrorist database now.
[01:16:02.869 --> 01:16:04.550]  You're never going to get off the list.
[01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:06.511]  We know you're a terrorist.
[01:16:06.511 --> 01:16:08.912]  And Douglas said he couldn't talk.
[01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.773]  He was like, excuse me?
[01:16:10.773 --> 01:16:11.014]  What?
[01:16:11.014 --> 01:16:18.858]  Because Douglas had told him, oh, no, we're with Infowars.com and we're here covering the G20 and we can't get out of the cordon.
[01:16:18.858 --> 01:16:19.538]  He told him that.
[01:16:20.586 --> 01:16:23.447]  And the guy just shifted gears and said, well, we put you on a terror database.
[01:16:23.447 --> 01:16:24.847]  You're never getting off of it.
[01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:31.950]  Started laughing with pleasure at the false witness and the setup and everything that was happening, according to Douglas.
[01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:32.610]  And I called the guy.
[01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:35.150]  He admitted to a lot of it, but didn't admit to all of it.
[01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:37.631]  I'll give you his side of the story.
[01:16:37.631 --> 01:16:41.012]  And he said, well, you ran from the military.
[01:16:41.012 --> 01:16:43.413]  You were caught sneaking around the perimeter.
[01:16:43.413 --> 01:16:46.454]  Well, they drove up to the front gate and said, we'd like to speak to your public information officer.
[01:16:46.454 --> 01:16:48.375]  We'd like to interview him or find out when we can interview him tomorrow.
[01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:49.335]  That's standard procedure.
[01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:58.224]  They said, we don't believe you're real media, even though they gave him the Infowars press passes, which of course were media.
[01:16:58.224 --> 01:16:59.945]  They said, we want to talk to your boss in Austin.
[01:16:59.945 --> 01:17:00.906]  So they called.
[01:17:00.906 --> 01:17:04.388]  Then the public relations officer comes over, starts laughing.
[01:17:04.388 --> 01:17:07.430]  I hear this on the cell phone, being very rude, very arrogant.
[01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:09.412]  No, maybe come back tomorrow, we'll talk to you.
[01:17:09.412 --> 01:17:12.554]  You know, you need to get out of here.
[01:17:12.554 --> 01:17:13.414]  You're not real media.
[01:17:13.414 --> 01:17:14.815]  No, I don't want to talk to him.
[01:17:14.815 --> 01:17:17.317]  Douglas is, not Douglas, Dews like, but you wanted him.
[01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:20.207]  You know, this is who we are.
[01:17:20.207 --> 01:17:23.528]  And the guy's like, yeah, I actually went and called the number on that website.
[01:17:23.528 --> 01:17:24.188]  Nobody answered.
[01:17:24.188 --> 01:17:27.809]  You're not, you know, just go ahead and get on out of here.
[01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:28.890]  Maybe you can come back tomorrow.
[01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:29.950]  So they get in the car and leave.
[01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:39.593]  And I've talked to them as they get in the car and say, OK, well, I guess they'll show video of them setting up the cordons and, you know, go out and interview the military tomorrow, which they've now been able to do on the streets.
[01:17:39.593 --> 01:17:40.573]  That's coming up in the last hour.
[01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:41.994]  They're going to report live from the G20.
[01:17:44.068 --> 01:17:53.111]  So, complete lie by the police and the military saying they were sneaking around the perimeter, videotaping, they ran from them.
[01:17:53.111 --> 01:17:56.031]  I mean, just total lie.
[01:17:56.031 --> 01:17:57.272]  But see, that's the psychology.
[01:17:57.272 --> 01:18:01.473]  If they have to lie about you to then make it psychologically okay for them to then abuse you.
[01:18:01.473 --> 01:18:04.214]  And I said, well, why did you pose as an Alamo?
[01:18:05.234 --> 01:18:11.998]  Agent he said oh, it's legal for me to do a ruse and a terrorism Investigation I said terrorism investigations.
[01:18:11.998 --> 01:18:14.319]  Did you tell him they're in a terror database for life?
[01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:25.546]  Well, I did say I'd forward it to the FBI and there is a terrorism investigation now, so But you're not gonna be on the list for life and he was kind of laughing about it and
[01:18:27.546 --> 01:18:29.368]  It was just so bizarre.
[01:18:29.368 --> 01:18:30.869]  They don't even think of us as human beings.
[01:18:30.869 --> 01:18:36.794]  It's like New York, in Truth Rising, the video, the police come over and say, we know you're not a terrorist, but we're going to say you're a terrorist and arrest you.
[01:18:36.794 --> 01:18:37.695]  You're not allowed to protest.
[01:18:37.695 --> 01:18:39.457]  I don't care if you have a permit.
[01:18:39.457 --> 01:18:42.619]  And they grab their backpack and camera and say, this is a gun and a bomb.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:45.342]  On video, they don't even care.
[01:18:45.342 --> 01:18:50.927]  They think it's normal to commit these hardcore crimes right out in the open.
[01:18:52.972 --> 01:19:01.159]  So if they'll frame you on video and say, I know you're innocent, but I'm now going to frame you, and then they don't get in trouble, what else will they do?
[01:19:01.159 --> 01:19:08.305]  But think of the 1984 aspect of just them enjoyably saying, ha ha, I'm gonna put you on a terror list.
[01:19:08.305 --> 01:19:12.168]  I'm gonna put you on the Jew roundup list, like Nazi Germany.
[01:19:12.168 --> 01:19:14.670]  I'm gonna put you on the communist list.
[01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:15.971]  Then you can't fly.
[01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:19.614]  Now they're saying if you're on a no-fly list or the terror list, you won't be able to buy a gun, get credit.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:28.625]  And so we're going to check, and if Douglas ever has a problem, I'm going to sue the police officer, and I'm going to sue the FBI.
[01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:30.887]  And I promise I'm going to do that.
[01:19:30.887 --> 01:19:32.047]  We have to.
[01:19:32.047 --> 01:19:34.029]  We have to stand up against these people.
[01:19:34.029 --> 01:19:35.830]  We're human beings.
[01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:40.673]  But see, no judge, no jury, they just drop you into a bottomless pit of a secret list.
[01:19:40.673 --> 01:19:43.155]  I'm going to go over more of this when we come back and some of the other facets.
[01:19:44.218 --> 01:19:53.402]  But in America, you try to go talk to a public relations officer, you try to go out and interview the military, you go out on the streets of Pennsylvania, and you are a terrorist.
[01:19:53.402 --> 01:19:59.965]  Because the Justice Department has said, just Google the term, Justice Department memo, calls all protests low-level terrorism.
[01:19:59.965 --> 01:20:01.066]  No, you are the terrorist!

[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.441]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:07.968]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:07.968 --> 01:21:08.509]  I get it.
[01:21:08.509 --> 01:21:18.140]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:19.302]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:28.007]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:28.007 --> 01:21:31.409]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.409 --> 01:21:35.672]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:35.672 --> 01:21:37.272]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.272 --> 01:21:40.674]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:40.674 --> 01:21:44.837]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:45.037 --> 01:21:45.937]  You should, too.
[01:21:45.937 --> 01:21:47.078]  Find out what they know.

[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.661]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.661 --> 01:21:56.242]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:56.242 --> 01:21:56.563]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:56.563 --> 01:22:07.188]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:14.211]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:14.753 --> 01:22:21.335]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.335 --> 01:22:23.315]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.315 --> 01:22:25.816]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:36.779]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.381 --> 01:22:39.042]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:40.903]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:40.903 --> 01:22:47.828]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:56.093 --> 01:22:57.654]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.654 --> 01:22:58.855]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.646 --> 01:23:04.427]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:23:04.427 --> 01:23:14.571]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:23:14.571 --> 01:23:21.814]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:23:22.054 --> 01:23:36.339]  If you're ready to live your life free of sickness, pain and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy and youthfulness and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.

[01:23:50.603 --> 01:23:50.883]  We're good.
[01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:30.069]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:24:30.069 --> 01:24:30.689]  to 3 p.m.
[01:24:30.689 --> 01:24:32.510]  we defend the Republic.
[01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:35.671]  We wage war on corruption with a mighty weapon of truth.
[01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:38.971]  We crash at the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:38.971 --> 01:24:47.033]  Congressman Ron Paul coming up later in the hour as we cover the world government takeover happening in plain view.
[01:24:47.033 --> 01:24:54.855]  But notice the establishment for decades said there's no world government, no plan to have a Bank of the World, the Federal Reserve is not private, everything is fine.
[01:24:55.936 --> 01:24:57.457]  We're not going to put troops on the streets.
[01:24:57.457 --> 01:25:02.219]  It's all conspiracy theory, as they slowly built the infrastructure of control.
[01:25:02.219 --> 01:25:09.322]  And then now, they're openly announcing it, but the general public's been conditioned to not be able to talk about it because that's weird.
[01:25:09.322 --> 01:25:15.025]  You know, you don't talk about a foreign corporate takeover, because that doesn't exist.
[01:25:15.025 --> 01:25:18.867]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all over the news.
[01:25:18.867 --> 01:25:23.609]  And they're now trying to push mandatory swine flu shots on the firefighters and police.
[01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:31.814]  You guys think they let you carry all these crimes and violations of the Constitution against the people, but you're not going to be hurt?
[01:25:31.814 --> 01:25:33.716]  You are the people they hate more than anyone.
[01:25:33.716 --> 01:25:35.317]  They fear their enforcers.
[01:25:35.317 --> 01:25:47.865]  Throughout history, tyrannical and despotic and oppressive systems in phases purge you and attack you and put you more than they do any other group.
[01:25:47.865 --> 01:25:49.726]  You're under some very black wings.
[01:25:51.732 --> 01:25:56.716]  I mean, you think the system you're under is nuzzling you and suckling you and loving you.
[01:25:56.716 --> 01:26:04.301]  It's doing the opposite.
[01:26:04.301 --> 01:26:14.709]  And I pray you'll get your head screwed on straight, but let it sink in for everybody just how off-the-charts hardcore it is to have the military and the police
[01:26:17.315 --> 01:26:21.896]  Putting a million two hundred thousand, and I brought this up to the police officer over the phone, he goes, yeah, I know.
[01:26:21.896 --> 01:26:25.517]  And that was a year ago, almost a year ago, ten months ago, eleven months ago.
[01:26:25.517 --> 01:26:28.598]  It's been secret since then, but they were adding 25,000 people a month.
[01:26:28.598 --> 01:26:42.061]  Remember two years ago, the Denver Post reported that the head federal marshal, air marshal, over the Denver sector that's over several states said that they're protesting, that they're ordered
[01:26:43.356 --> 01:26:44.817]  To have a quota?
[01:26:44.817 --> 01:26:45.538]  Just Google.
[01:26:45.538 --> 01:26:48.060]  Air Marshals say they have a quota on watch list.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:50.902]  And they say children taking photographs in the airport.
[01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:51.923]  Families laughing.
[01:26:51.923 --> 01:26:53.904]  People ordering vegetarian meals.
[01:26:53.904 --> 01:26:56.486]  They're ordered to put them on a terror list for life.
[01:26:56.486 --> 01:26:57.687]  A secret list?
[01:26:57.687 --> 01:26:58.748]  No way to get off of it.
[01:26:58.748 --> 01:27:00.249]  No way to know why you were put on it.
[01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:06.348]  And then they just set the precedent that millions and millions of innocent people are on it, but that it's for your own good.
[01:27:06.348 --> 01:27:14.980]  And then they put you and your families through the naked body scanners and record the child porn images and the images of your wife and you onto their government computers.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.784]  Now they have a biometric image of a 360 of your body.
[01:27:20.734 --> 01:27:32.705]  And it's pure terrorism, psychological terror, to openly say, don't criticize the government, don't get involved, don't protest the Fed, don't go to tea parties, or you'll be put on a list to try to chill Americans.
[01:27:32.705 --> 01:27:37.249]  Let me tell you something, if we give in to this chilling effect, if we let the system
[01:27:39.758 --> 01:27:49.129]  Have their way and set the precedent that they can, outside of any court, outside of any judge, in a secret system, put millions of people who are innocent on a list, including children.
[01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:52.333]  That's in, although Obama deception, a four-year-old boy on it.
[01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:54.956]  You can't get off and that's the end of it.
[01:27:54.956 --> 01:27:56.678]  Mainstream news.
[01:27:56.678 --> 01:27:58.059]  And they laugh about it.
[01:27:58.059 --> 01:27:58.460]  It's funny!
[01:28:00.523 --> 01:28:05.445]  And then they say, you better not criticize anything we're doing in this corporate takeover, or we'll put you on a list.
[01:28:05.445 --> 01:28:07.746]  And now they're saying, if you're on the list, you can't buy guns.
[01:28:07.746 --> 01:28:08.866]  No judge, no jury.
[01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:11.387]  That's the no-fly, no-buy law.
[01:28:11.387 --> 01:28:16.509]  And the Attorney General's saying, even if they don't pass the law, he's just gonna implement it regulatory.
[01:28:16.509 --> 01:28:29.074]  Just like they have a regulation for $15 million fines if you sell recalled items over a decade old at any garage sale, or flea market, or bazaar, or market.
[01:28:30.233 --> 01:28:39.615]  I mean, they're going after the Amish and farmers and ranchers, selling cows themselves, selling eggs, selling squash or watermelon, in the cases we've seen, or cheese.
[01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:42.576]  They're just going crazy on us with classical tyranny!
[01:28:42.576 --> 01:28:44.076]  We know what this is!
[01:28:44.076 --> 01:28:49.798]  And they say, we're gonna put you on a secret list, and now they say, we're gonna take your blood at checkpoints without a warrant.
[01:28:50.558 --> 01:29:09.112]  And they go, yeah, we're using the Patriot Act, breaking in your home secretly for marijuana cases, and Child Protective Services in Texas tried to pass a law, and we narrowly defeated it, where they would take your kids without even a judge's order, with no probable cause, without even telling you they took them, and your medical records without a warrant.
[01:29:09.112 --> 01:29:11.213]  I mean, this is hardcore tyranny!
[01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:15.417]  And then they intimidate you and say, sit down and take it, or we'll put you on a list.
[01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:17.438]  If we give in to this, everybody goes on the list.
[01:29:17.438 --> 01:29:19.540]  They're saying if you have bad credit now, you're going to go on the list.
[01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:21.771]  That's mainstream news.
[01:29:21.771 --> 01:29:23.272]  They're gonna make us all terrorists.
[01:29:23.272 --> 01:29:24.233]  That's what this is for.
[01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:26.034]  That's what the DHS report states.
[01:29:26.034 --> 01:29:28.155]  That's what the Patriot Act Section 802 states.
[01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:31.798]  Any misdemeanor, you're a terrorist.
[01:29:31.798 --> 01:29:33.479]  This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:33.479 --> 01:29:34.740]  This is hardcore.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.381]  This is the New World Order.
[01:29:36.381 --> 01:29:37.562]  This isn't a game.
[01:29:37.562 --> 01:29:39.483]  This isn't a joke.
[01:29:39.483 --> 01:29:44.987]  I'm begging all of you to stand up and speak out and don't let this chilling effect work or they've won.
[01:29:46.192 --> 01:29:48.895]  They need to be brought to justice for the crimes they're committing.
[01:29:48.895 --> 01:29:51.298]  They need to be arrested for this terror list.
[01:29:51.298 --> 01:29:52.699]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.699 --> 01:29:55.222]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.222 --> 01:29:57.925]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.261]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:09.583]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:11.624]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.624 --> 01:30:16.625]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:17.806]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.806 --> 01:30:18.946]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:20.827]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.827 --> 01:30:21.887]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.887 --> 01:30:24.088]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.088 --> 01:30:25.449]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.449 --> 01:30:26.749]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.969 --> 01:30:32.236]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.236 --> 01:30:35.821]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.821 --> 01:30:39.646]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.646 --> 01:30:40.868]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:41.769]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:42.870]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.611]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.611 --> 01:30:44.613]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.873 --> 01:30:47.935]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:00.293 --> 01:31:05.600]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:10.126]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:12.409]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.409 --> 01:31:14.031]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.031 --> 01:31:15.073]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.293 --> 01:31:23.715]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:33:18.052 --> 01:33:26.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, joining us on this Thursday, September 24, 2009 edition is Congressman Ron Paul, live from Congress.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.261]  Just got done with a vote.
[01:33:28.261 --> 01:33:30.823]  We just interviewed Congressman Grayson in the last hour.
[01:33:30.823 --> 01:33:33.646]  Great to have him on the team fighting the private Fed.
[01:33:33.646 --> 01:33:36.128]  Congressman, it is great to have you, sir.
[01:33:36.128 --> 01:33:36.508]  Thank you.
[01:33:36.508 --> 01:33:37.209]  Good to be with you again.
[01:33:38.888 --> 01:33:53.393]  I want to get in the final segment into your book coming out in the Fed, but first, I've got the Times of London, the London Telegraph, AFP, Dollar Under Scrutiny at G20 Summit, HSBC bids farewell to dollar supremacy.
[01:33:53.393 --> 01:33:57.235]  They say the world is now going to move away from the dollar.
[01:33:57.235 --> 01:33:59.415]  They're announcing global governments.
[01:33:59.415 --> 01:34:04.077]  President Kloss, your friend, you've been over there to speak as a guest of the government.
[01:34:04.637 --> 01:34:07.959]  Is saying this is global government at the UN yesterday.
[01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:13.442]  So people are waking up, but now the establishment is making its move.
[01:34:13.442 --> 01:34:16.043]  Can you speak to what's happening with the dollar?
[01:34:16.755 --> 01:34:22.296]  Well, the dollar, of course, today bounced up a little bit, but that's just temporary because of some announcements.
[01:34:22.296 --> 01:34:25.937]  But the dollar is in bad trouble, and they know it.
[01:34:25.937 --> 01:34:30.699]  A lot of people ask me exactly what's going on in the G20 meetings, and of course there are a lot of announcements.
[01:34:30.699 --> 01:34:35.340]  I think the really big stuff that goes on at these meetings is behind the scenes, and there are no announcements.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:45.765]  My guess would be that behind the scenes they are really, really making the plans for what's going to replace the dollar reserve standard, because they're sick and tired of us getting a free ride.
[01:34:45.765 --> 01:34:50.547]  We get to print the money and get to spend it, and they're supposed to hang on to it as if it were gold.
[01:34:50.547 --> 01:34:59.031]  But they're planning on something else, but they have a job in front of them, because it's not easy creating another fiat currency.
[01:35:00.331 --> 01:35:08.334]  When a government ruins a currency, they go back to something more sound and back their currency or make gold, silver, legal tender.
[01:35:08.334 --> 01:35:10.194]  They don't want to do that.
[01:35:10.194 --> 01:35:14.376]  That's why I suspect they'll move in the direction of just a new world order.
[01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:18.597]  And I hear and I've heard Obama recently use that term again.
[01:35:18.597 --> 01:35:20.178]  They've got to have a new world order.
[01:35:20.919 --> 01:35:34.140]  And they've been working on that for a long time, and I'm sure they're not worried all that much about a crisis coming, and they might look at it as an opportunity, you know, for promoting their cause, and that's what we should be concerned about.
[01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:48.602]  Well that's what Congressman Grayson said last hour with us is that the banks, he believes, have engineered this to create a crisis to vertically integrate society and then they offer the solution as this new bank of the world that will fund itself off carbon taxes and Tobin taxes.
[01:35:48.602 --> 01:35:49.763]  Al Gore has called for that.
[01:35:49.763 --> 01:35:59.251]  Gordon Brown this week, as you know, has called for a new world order under the Tobin tax and that they're just going to have regional cashless systems with the
[01:36:00.692 --> 01:36:08.583]  Big bank reserves already going to a cashless system and then all the nation state currencies will still be there, but they'll be globally standardized.
[01:36:09.198 --> 01:36:13.902]  Yeah, but what we have going for us is that their system can't work.
[01:36:13.902 --> 01:36:16.644]  It's just sort of like worrying about the Soviet Union.
[01:36:16.644 --> 01:36:20.526]  We worried about it for a long time, and had to be, and they were very powerful.
[01:36:20.526 --> 01:36:24.610]  But even Mises, a long time ago, predicted it won't last.
[01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:25.951]  The system doesn't work.
[01:36:25.951 --> 01:36:28.372]  So what they're proposing really doesn't work.
[01:36:28.372 --> 01:36:32.836]  It's sort of like what they did, the IMF and our Treasury did in the 60s and early 70s.
[01:36:33.556 --> 01:36:33.997]  We're good to go.
[01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:54.315]  Congressman, the Federal Reserve, as you know, has hired the top Enron lobbyist firm.
[01:37:13.812 --> 01:37:13.952]  to
[01:37:32.481 --> 01:37:35.583]  It's amazing how long they've gotten away with it, but we're getting the American people
[01:38:00.678 --> 01:38:01.219]  I don't think so.
[01:38:17.151 --> 01:38:20.594]  And he gave me one witness, and they were going to have two panels.
[01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:25.157]  Ordinarily, the majority has two witnesses against one, you know, two to one.
[01:38:25.157 --> 01:38:31.381]  But then they have a government panel, which has to represent the body that we're addressing, which is the Federal Reserve.
[01:38:31.381 --> 01:38:34.063]  They were supposed to have three people testifying.
[01:38:34.063 --> 01:38:39.287]  Only one has agreed to come on the second panel, where there were going to be two in opposition to 1207 and my one pick.
[01:38:41.528 --> 01:38:57.493]  Those two cancelled out too, so they're down to one person that came to testify against the 1207, and I suspect it may well be that they don't want to even be out there, you know, really chopping at the bit.
[01:38:57.493 --> 01:39:01.594]  They might work behind the scenes behind us, but they're not interested in taking us on in a public forum.
[01:39:02.205 --> 01:39:04.027]  They don't want to give any attention to it.
[01:39:04.027 --> 01:39:07.030]  They think it may be covered by the news networks.
[01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:09.673]  Ed Bernanke or somebody like that is there, but it's too late.
[01:39:09.673 --> 01:39:12.957]  As you've said many times, the momentum is now beginning to shift.
[01:39:12.957 --> 01:39:14.839]  The people are like, why can't we audit the Fed?
[01:39:14.839 --> 01:39:18.423]  They're realizing that the real power structure, the real government,
[01:39:18.943 --> 01:39:24.467]  Is the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and I meant to get to this issue of the hearings.
[01:39:24.467 --> 01:39:36.696]  Can you talk about what's going to happen tomorrow and then how you see the process unfolding in the months and years to come in bringing this corporate private banking dictatorship to heel?
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.403]  Well, I think tomorrow's hearings will be pretty bland.
[01:39:40.403 --> 01:39:41.363]  That would be my guess.
[01:39:41.363 --> 01:39:43.065]  Probably not much media.
[01:39:43.065 --> 01:39:50.131]  But we'll get a recording of it, and Tom Wood, the good economist and historian from the Visa Institute, he'll be testifying for us.
[01:39:50.131 --> 01:39:57.578]  And he will have a very good statement, and he's a very bright person and knows how to handle a debate like this.
[01:39:58.098 --> 01:40:09.606]  Bernie Frank will probably be not antagonistic nor derogatory toward the bill and he will try to publicly pacify the people who are concerned and worried about it.
[01:40:09.606 --> 01:40:21.554]  But I don't think it'll be big news tomorrow, but it's big news among our circles because we have gotten him to a point where many others who have tried over the many, many decades and have never gotten this far just think,
[01:40:22.114 --> 01:40:34.053]  You know, Henry Royce, Wright Patman, and Henry Gonzales, all coming from a liberal populist viewpoint, have always, they were chairmen of the banking committees, and they never got this far on auditing the Fed.
[01:40:34.053 --> 01:40:37.038]  So, we are making progress, but it also might be a sign of
[01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:42.240]  How bad things are to wake up the American people to finally say, hey, what is this all about?
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:43.661]  What about this Fed?
[01:40:43.661 --> 01:40:53.545]  So I think it's the crisis that we're in, as well as the time has come around, and I think our communications are so much better with radio talk shows like this, as well as the Internet.
[01:40:53.545 --> 01:40:56.286]  This has really spread a message among people.
[01:40:56.286 --> 01:40:57.706]  Today, I just walked out of my office.
[01:40:57.706 --> 01:40:59.427]  I was visiting with one of my constituents.
[01:41:00.047 --> 01:41:10.855]  And I had a young guy came out in his college, he's from Arizona, and his biggest issue with the Federal Reserve, and I think my constituent looked at him and said, wow, you know, he was so impressive.
[01:41:10.855 --> 01:41:18.001]  Some college kid from the Arizona state came up and he was fascinated, you know, with the Federal Reserve.
[01:41:18.001 --> 01:41:19.322]  So we are making progress.
[01:41:20.698 --> 01:41:23.899]  Is this the beginning of game over for the Federal Reserve?
[01:41:23.899 --> 01:41:34.523]  Because once they're identified as the true shadow government, the financial oligarchy, as long as they can operate the shadows and pose as a federal agency, they were invincible.
[01:41:34.523 --> 01:41:46.887]  But once the curtain drops on the little man who we thought was the big powerful Wizard of Oz, once the illusion is shattered, which is now happening, it begins the process of their fall.
[01:41:47.407 --> 01:41:53.570]  I think it might be beginning, but I don't think we're very far along because I don't think they have yet begun to fight.
[01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:55.592]  I mean, they are going to be tenacious.
[01:41:55.592 --> 01:41:59.834]  Look at what they've done with the lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:41:59.834 --> 01:42:00.734]  They are resisting.
[01:42:00.734 --> 01:42:01.395]  They're fighting it.
[01:42:01.395 --> 01:42:03.596]  Those court cases are going to go on for years.
[01:42:03.596 --> 01:42:04.577]  They're going to fight this.
[01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:07.678]  They're going to resist and argue about turning over records.
[01:42:07.678 --> 01:42:11.260]  So it's not going to be real easy.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:14.222]  I think what will happen when you have
[01:42:15.002 --> 01:42:18.724]  A dramatic change will be when the dollar quits working.
[01:42:18.724 --> 01:42:24.247]  I just think they're going to fight us tooth and nail, and it's going to be very, very difficult.
[01:42:24.247 --> 01:42:29.530]  They'll find the ways to further imprison people who demand that they use silver and gold.
[01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:37.874]  So I just think that it'll be runaway inflation, high interest rates, where the American people will say, yeah, I think we were told about this Federal Reserve.
[01:42:38.474 --> 01:42:41.717]  And we need to do more, and then they'll lose all credibility.
[01:42:41.717 --> 01:42:43.818]  And besides, printing the money won't help that much.
[01:42:43.818 --> 01:42:45.520]  The more they print, the worse it'll be.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:55.528]  Right now, they print a lot of money to try to patch the system together, and in some ways they have patched it together, but they dumped all the bad assets on the taxpayer.
[01:42:55.528 --> 01:42:58.030]  You can't have a wealthy country by doing that.
[01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:02.213]  That has to have bad results.
[01:43:02.213 --> 01:43:05.215]  But when the dollar collapses, there's nowhere else to go.
[01:43:09.477 --> 01:43:23.826]  I don't even pretend to know what's best to suggest you do tomorrow in these hearings, but I know you're a very polite, focused, intelligent, scholarly person.
[01:43:23.826 --> 01:43:33.532]  I would just encourage you to call him out and to be as aggressive as possible because that more firmly cements you as the leader.
[01:43:34.192 --> 01:43:54.960]  I think you're the man for the job against these people and I would also hope that you would entertain and perhaps I would ask now what your opinion is of this to bring up the conflict of interest issue that you have this revolving door between Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and the governors of the private Fed like Geithner, Paulson, Bernanke, the campaign contributions to both parties.
[01:43:56.593 --> 01:44:03.376]  Of course, Barack Obama getting four times the Goldman Sachs money, almost five times that John McCain got.
[01:44:03.376 --> 01:44:10.539]  I really think if you just discredit them out of the gates, that's the one thing that I've noticed in these hearings and I've watched scores of them.
[01:44:10.539 --> 01:44:11.740]  I know you've been in scores of them.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.281]  I watch them at night when I get home.
[01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:16.522]  I recorded hours of it and that's...
[01:44:17.142 --> 01:44:30.363]  Seems to be the cross or the holy water to the vampires just to call these people out that they're the ones that changed the regulations, they're the ones that created the derivatives, they're the ones that are a revolving door in there robbing the bank.
[01:44:30.879 --> 01:44:39.382]  Well, there'll be a limit to how much of that I can do, because I'll have a five-minute opening statement and five minutes to quiz the individuals.
[01:44:39.382 --> 01:44:44.244]  But they're not sending the people that you could really hit on those questions.
[01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:45.904]  They're sending the General Counsel.
[01:44:45.904 --> 01:44:48.905]  Now, he's going to be a legal guy.
[01:44:48.905 --> 01:44:51.987]  He's going to explain the law and that sort of thing.
[01:44:51.987 --> 01:44:54.968]  They're going to hide behind the technicalities of the law.
[01:44:54.968 --> 01:44:56.248]  But I think your suggestions are good.
[01:44:56.248 --> 01:44:57.729]  We should call on him.
[01:44:59.069 --> 01:45:04.851]  I will have to decide tomorrow exactly how I'm going to hit them and what the atmosphere is like.
[01:45:04.851 --> 01:45:25.298]  Sure, we don't want to let the cat out of the bag or let them know our plan of attack to defend the Republic, but clearly if you say, sir, because obviously you're going to be asking him questions for a future hearing, can you go back and ask him how the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve gives itself waivers to allow them to give money to institutions they own stock in?
[01:45:26.929 --> 01:45:32.453]  Well, it should be shocking, but unfortunately that's about the way they run everything.
[01:45:32.453 --> 01:45:35.275]  They're always, you know, skirting the law.
[01:45:35.275 --> 01:45:45.883]  It's only the people who have to, if they have any infraction on not obeying an illegal law or disobeying or obeying the Constitution, then the roof comes down on us.
[01:45:45.883 --> 01:45:50.106]  But to them, that's, you know, just routine activities.
[01:45:50.646 --> 01:45:55.287]  But, they should be called on it, and that's exactly where the American people are waking up.
[01:45:55.287 --> 01:45:59.428]  They're sick and tired of hearing it, and the more they hear it, the better.
[01:45:59.428 --> 01:46:06.329]  Congressman, looking at this, just a pep talk to the people, not that they need much of one.
[01:46:06.329 --> 01:46:11.830]  Folks are seeing victory, they're smelling blood, they know that the Federal Reserve, the private cartel, isn't invincible.
[01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:14.551]  But, Congressman Grayson pointed out in the last hour, you, in 1983,
[01:46:17.557 --> 01:46:42.682]  First introduce this audit the Fed bill and then now here we are twenty five twenty six years later and even though it may take a few more years to really have victory over these people we are now I believe in the end game here and can you speak to the power of perseverance and focus you literally on the front lines toiling to do this and then what is it like for you to actually see
[01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:52.998]  Uh, Jerusalem, to actually be going into the Promised Land, to now be able to look over the mountain, and after this 10,000 mile journey, you're now only a few hundred miles away.
[01:46:52.998 --> 01:46:58.583]  I don't like to address that in a personal way as much as in general.
[01:46:58.583 --> 01:47:09.854]  I think if an individual wants, if a person wants to change things, they have to deal in principle, they have to have an ability to state it clearly,
[01:47:10.541 --> 01:47:12.302]  And they have to persevere.
[01:47:12.302 --> 01:47:14.563]  Perseverance, I think, is very, very important.
[01:47:14.563 --> 01:47:16.064]  But you have to have truth on your side.
[01:47:16.064 --> 01:47:17.725]  And eventually, you do win.
[01:47:17.725 --> 01:47:20.907]  Actually, I did not believe we would get this far.
[01:47:20.907 --> 01:47:27.671]  I did not believe that the campaign that we ran last year would get very far.
[01:47:27.671 --> 01:47:31.893]  So it was much more encouraging to me to realize that there were a lot of people.
[01:47:31.893 --> 01:47:33.674]  I believed when I came to Congress.
[01:47:33.674 --> 01:47:36.095]  In fact, when I ran, I never thought I would be coming to Congress.
[01:47:36.095 --> 01:47:36.796]  When I came, I thought,
[01:47:37.296 --> 01:47:46.580]  Well, my role and responsibility is to try to leave a record saying, you know, what would it be like if you had somebody that took the oath of office very seriously?
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.840]  How would that person vote?
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:58.704]  Realizing, you know, what I was up against, because I realize you, and I would use the term, we can't really run against Santa Claus, that you're not going to get reelected.
[01:47:58.704 --> 01:48:03.506]  So I was surprised I got elected, surprised I got reelected, but pleasantly surprised to find out that
[01:48:03.986 --> 01:48:12.497]  This attitude of perseverance and standing for principle, you know, really can bring about good results.
[01:48:12.497 --> 01:48:18.605]  So I'm pleased with it, but it's the power of the ideas more than my personal abilities, quite frankly.
[01:48:19.155 --> 01:48:20.976]  Well, sir, I appreciate your humbleness.
[01:48:20.976 --> 01:48:24.599]  I'm not here trying to lavish praise on you for praise sake.
[01:48:24.599 --> 01:48:30.743]  I think as a model or an example of perseverance, you are the standard.
[01:48:30.743 --> 01:48:44.573]  You're the blood of courage, and I want you to know that, no, I want you to know I have three children, just like you have a lot of children and grandchildren, and I care about them, and I know that we're going to be a third world hell if you're not successful, if I'm not successful.
[01:48:45.493 --> 01:48:51.961]  And I just really do admire you and I know everybody, for everybody out there, we want to thank you for all you've done.
[01:48:52.998 --> 01:48:54.279]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:48:54.279 --> 01:48:58.801]  I appreciate that, and evidently our numbers are much bigger than any of us knows.
[01:48:58.801 --> 01:49:00.382]  You know the story about the remnant.
[01:49:00.382 --> 01:49:01.703]  Nobody can count the remnant.
[01:49:01.703 --> 01:49:12.028]  Nobody knows where they are, but they're out there, and I think we each and every one of us are looking for each other, and it's just great to find allies.
[01:49:12.028 --> 01:49:17.331]  I always tell people in my crowd, I said, you know, I don't know what tomorrow will bring, and I don't have
[01:49:18.092 --> 01:49:33.355]  Uh, you know, I don't have over-expectations, but in the meantime, we ought to have an enjoyment of associating with like-minded people and having these goals and ideals, because at least we can say that we made the effort and we communicated.
[01:49:33.735 --> 01:49:38.036]  But fortunately for us today, we have seen some fruits of our labor.
[01:49:38.036 --> 01:49:50.019]  Can you imagine fighting this battle in 1939 or sometime back then when the New Deal was in and then the World Empire was really starting the militarism of the world?
[01:49:50.019 --> 01:50:00.582]  I would have thought back in 1938-39, in the Roosevelt era, it must have been pretty humbling for those who were trying to hold these principles together.
[01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:03.597]  We've only got seven minutes left with the Congressman.
[01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:06.360]  I'm going to skip this break so we have time to do that.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.002]  It's a network break.
[01:50:08.002 --> 01:50:17.634]  And before he leaves, we're going to talk about his new book, In the Fed, really a manifesto, a constitution against this abomination, one arm of this larger private crime syndicate.
[01:50:17.634 --> 01:50:18.335]  But Congressman,
[01:50:20.257 --> 01:50:31.606]  A. What can we do briefly to fight and help you and others that are leading this charge to defeat the Fed quicker in this battle, in this war, for truth?
[01:50:31.606 --> 01:50:34.448]  A. And then B. What do you think their counter-strikes are going to be?
[01:50:34.448 --> 01:50:37.490]  The Governor's Association a month ago wrote a letter
[01:50:38.551 --> 01:50:46.857]  Uh, to the Pentagon and the White House saying, what are you doing saying 379,000 troops they now want for brigade homeland through NORTHCOM?
[01:50:46.857 --> 01:50:50.339]  Uh, that's also in the progressive NAP.
[01:50:50.339 --> 01:50:59.805]  Uh, they are, I don't know if you've seen this, suddenly we're getting YouTube videos from Kingman, Arizona to Louisville, Kentucky of regular National Guard and Army running checkpoints, sir, searching people.
[01:50:59.805 --> 01:51:00.826]  We've gone and interviewed them now.
[01:51:01.326 --> 01:51:22.562]  And it appears that we're seeing a slow takeover and former congressman, former Republican leader was in the Dallas Morning News, Dick Armey, just giving you a quick briefing in case, I'm sure you know about most of it, saying yes, he believes Obama may use the flu scare to kind of smoke screen passing health care, gun control, open borders, financial reform, giving the banks more power.
[01:51:22.562 --> 01:51:28.426]  So can you speak to what we can do to fight these people and to the whole police state that's really expanding right now?
[01:51:28.732 --> 01:51:35.278]  Well, I'm afraid positive commentators is about dead, according to what Obama wants.
[01:51:35.278 --> 01:51:40.322]  You know, when they passed the HIPAA law, HIPAA law was the one that said that they were going to protect your medical privacy.
[01:51:40.322 --> 01:51:44.166]  In actuality, it was exactly the opposite.
[01:51:44.166 --> 01:51:50.712]  Because in that HIPAA law, it said in case of a national emergency, the government has a right to all your records.
[01:51:51.312 --> 01:51:53.673]  Now, you talk about a scare.
[01:51:53.673 --> 01:52:02.756]  They keep scaring and frightening people and they put the high executives taking these flu shots and how dangerous it is and on and on.
[01:52:02.756 --> 01:52:06.998]  So, I think they're almost just welcoming and waiting.
[01:52:06.998 --> 01:52:11.740]  Boy, if there's just a little bit more we can declare all this national emergency stuff.
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.681]  But it's done under, you know, they have set the stage
[01:52:14.701 --> 01:52:15.202]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.366 --> 01:52:37.987]  Well, this really hit home for me, and I've talked to the Pittsburgh, the county that Pittsburgh is in.
[01:52:37.987 --> 01:52:38.567]  You grew up there.
[01:52:38.567 --> 01:52:39.447]  What's the name of the county?
[01:52:39.447 --> 01:52:40.267]  Allegheny.
[01:52:40.267 --> 01:52:41.568]  Yeah, Allegheny.
[01:52:41.568 --> 01:52:42.928]  And I talked to the police officer.
[01:52:42.928 --> 01:52:43.988]  We got his name.
[01:52:43.988 --> 01:52:51.669]  My guys were trying to interview the military and trying to ask him, because there's 2,500 of them there, including regular Army and Air Force, along with National Guard.
[01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:53.930]  They said, man, we speak to your public relations officer.
[01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:55.210]  And they said, no, we're not going to talk to you.
[01:52:55.210 --> 01:52:55.630]  Get out of here.
[01:52:55.630 --> 01:53:01.171]  And they followed him, got their license plate, and then called up, posing as the rental car company, the police department did.
[01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:02.611]  No, that's pretty bad.
[01:53:26.045 --> 01:53:29.648]  We don't know how many are doing that, but people enjoy doing that.
[01:53:29.648 --> 01:53:35.652]  They get this sense of superiority, and they have this power, but it's sort of pervasive throughout the system.
[01:53:35.652 --> 01:53:42.957]  Anybody that has this power, I mean, IRS agents love it, and they just like to lord it over other people.
[01:53:42.957 --> 01:53:47.080]  But people of true worth like yourself are incredibly humble.
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:50.903]  I wish we could get these control freaks to realize how fulfilling it is to be good.
[01:53:54.797 --> 01:53:57.059]  We can convert some people.
[01:53:57.059 --> 01:54:08.349]  I think the true satisfaction in life comes from, you know, being productive, producing something worthwhile, and being able to take care of oneself.
[01:54:08.349 --> 01:54:11.432]  But most people, you know, we're oriented towards saying that
[01:54:12.933 --> 01:54:20.014]  The only way that you can be moral and upright is to have a welfare state to make sure everybody's taken care of.
[01:54:20.014 --> 01:54:21.735]  Steal from one group and give to another.
[01:54:21.735 --> 01:54:36.537]  But I believe true satisfaction for individuals comes from work, hard effort, and the satisfaction that you can take care of yourself and your family, regardless of whether, you know, you're very wealthy, you're not wealthy, but you've maximized your abilities.
[01:54:36.537 --> 01:54:42.198]  Today, we do everything to de-emphasize the use of our abilities to assume responsibility for ourselves.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.842]  Well, they want us dependent so they can control us, the classic sharecropper system.
[01:54:46.842 --> 01:54:52.364]  Two final questions, we're going to let you go, Congressman, and we admire you and we're praying for you in the hearings tomorrow.
[01:54:52.364 --> 01:55:00.628]  In closing, tell us about In the Fed, the new book coming out, and please give us your take on when you believe the dollar will die.
[01:55:00.628 --> 01:55:03.549]  Well, on the dollar, I don't know.
[01:55:03.549 --> 01:55:05.350]  Nobody knows exactly when.
[01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:08.531]  Could come any time, but my guess is it's going to be a couple more years yet.
[01:55:09.179 --> 01:55:10.699]  That'll be devastating?
[01:55:10.699 --> 01:55:11.140]  I really do.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.581]  I think it's going to be a very bad time, a lot worse than what we've seen so far.
[01:55:15.581 --> 01:55:20.402]  That's when there's more likely to be riots in the street, because people are going to be very, very angry.
[01:55:20.402 --> 01:55:23.203]  They're already angry, but they'll get much angrier.
[01:55:23.203 --> 01:55:25.604]  I just hope they can direct their attention the right way.
[01:55:26.344 --> 01:55:30.628]  And the Fed has been out for a week and it's doing pretty well.
[01:55:30.628 --> 01:55:36.833]  The best vote for our movement is to buy a book because it's a political vote on this.
[01:55:36.833 --> 01:55:42.358]  The more books you sell and the more you show up on the New York Times list, the better off it is.
[01:55:42.358 --> 01:55:45.721]  And just as a set aside, I do not take personal
[01:55:46.141 --> 01:55:47.402]  Benefits from this.
[01:55:47.402 --> 01:55:50.585]  This book was donated to the Free Foundation.
[01:55:50.585 --> 01:55:54.548]  So I can push the sales of this book, not for personal gain.
[01:55:54.548 --> 01:55:55.669]  But it is a vote.
[01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:56.990]  It is a vote in many ways.
[01:55:56.990 --> 01:56:03.154]  If we can get it up to number one, which the revolution was for a short period of time, it will be noticed.
[01:56:03.154 --> 01:56:03.995]  It will be noticed.
[01:56:03.995 --> 01:56:11.221]  So buying one, two, or three books, they're not all that expensive, will be a vote that sends a message to a lot of people.
[01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:13.231]  And you're not taking personal gain.
[01:56:13.231 --> 01:56:13.952]  I've read the book.
[01:56:13.952 --> 01:56:15.353]  It's incredibly powerful.
[01:56:15.353 --> 01:56:17.575]  It is a manifesto against tyranny.
[01:56:17.575 --> 01:56:20.277]  Folks, get in the Fed, even if you know all about it.
[01:56:20.277 --> 01:56:21.178]  Buy 20 copies.
[01:56:21.178 --> 01:56:23.340]  Give it to friends, family, neighbors.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:25.401]  You can go to Amazon, bookstores everywhere.
[01:56:25.401 --> 01:56:28.324]  Where are some other places they can link through and get it?
[01:56:28.324 --> 01:56:29.745]  Where's the best place to buy it, Congressman?
[01:56:29.745 --> 01:56:40.554]  Well, I imagine the best price is probably Amazon, but you can go to CampaignForLiberty.com, too, and get it through there.
[01:56:41.129 --> 01:56:47.234]  I'm sure it will be available for a lot of websites, but right now, the quickest way to get it recorded is Amazon.
[01:56:47.234 --> 01:56:50.837]  In the Fed, by Congressman Ron Paul, climbing up the top charts.
[01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:52.718]  Sir, we have 30 seconds left.
[01:56:52.718 --> 01:56:54.800]  Final comment.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.623]  All I know is that we're making progress, and I am very pleased.
[01:56:58.623 --> 01:57:05.328]  I just hope we can continue this way, and if we do our job, we can win this, but we live in very dangerous times.
[01:57:07.148 --> 01:57:08.149]  God bless you, sir.
[01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.849]  Godspeed.
[01:57:08.849 --> 01:57:11.310]  And say hi to Carol and the rest of the family.
[01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:13.611]  And say hi to Wayne and everybody for us.
[01:57:13.611 --> 01:57:15.873]  And again, we'll see you next time.
[01:57:15.873 --> 01:57:16.153]  Very good.
[01:57:16.153 --> 01:57:16.353]  Thank you.
[01:57:16.857 --> 01:57:17.818]  Thank you.
[01:57:17.818 --> 01:57:21.660]  There goes Congressman Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:22.640]  And I skipped two breaks today.
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.621]  I don't normally do that.
[01:57:23.621 --> 01:57:25.662]  Those are network breaks.
[01:57:25.662 --> 01:57:27.523]  Those sponsors get their breaks back, of course.
[01:57:27.523 --> 01:57:28.664]  Don't forget to support us.
[01:57:28.664 --> 01:57:36.068]  We're carrying the new film that I consulted on and I'm in, Camp FEMA, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:36.068 --> 01:57:39.831]  That's also a vote for freedom, but get it, show it to people, have viewing parties.
[01:57:39.831 --> 01:57:43.573]  This film documents the real FEMA camps, the police state, the New World Order,
[01:57:44.653 --> 01:57:50.938]  Uh, Homeland Security, North Com, this is such an important film, and I've just been too busy making my other films.
[01:57:50.938 --> 01:57:57.604]  I've been intending to make a FEMA camp film, so I told William Lewis, when he contacted me, I said, why don't I just help you and advise you, and he did follow my advice.
[01:57:57.604 --> 01:57:59.125]  He really knocked it out of the park.
[01:57:59.125 --> 01:58:00.486]  It's got a lot of Alex Jones in it.
[01:58:00.486 --> 01:58:04.730]  I mean, I'm in it, but it's got a lot of me and my advice on what to make it, what to put in it.
[01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:09.031]  And so, it's a William Lewis film, but it's got a lot of Alex Jones in it.
[01:58:09.031 --> 01:58:14.812]  If you want to really know what I know about the FEMA camps, but I understand my deep research and knowledge, InfoWars.com.

[01:58:50.657 --> 01:58:54.898]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.898 --> 01:58:56.898]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.898 --> 01:59:05.420]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:10.962]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.962 --> 01:59:12.602]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.842 --> 01:59:19.346]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.346 --> 01:59:30.413]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.413 --> 01:59:33.735]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.735 --> 01:59:35.556]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:46.523]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:46.523 --> 01:59:47.383]  Big Brother.
[01:59:47.383 --> 01:59:48.144]  Mainstream Media.
[02:00:08.328 --> 02:00:10.109]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:27.200]  Chairman Bernanke, I'm looking at the report that you handed out this morning, and I was wondering if you could take your copy and turn to page 26.
[02:00:42.938 --> 02:00:58.409]  There's a table on page 26 which consists of your balance sheet and one of the entries on the balance sheet is under assets, central bank liquidity swaps, which shows an increase from the end of 2007 from $24 billion to $553 billion in change at the end of 2008.
[02:00:58.409 --> 02:00:58.690]  What's that?
[02:01:08.098 --> 02:01:11.486]  Those are swaps that were done with foreign central banks.
[02:01:11.486 --> 02:01:16.157]  Many foreign banks are short dollars.
[02:01:16.767 --> 02:01:21.629]  And so do our markets looking for dollars and drive up interest rates and create volatility in our markets.
[02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:30.013]  What we have done is, with a number of major central banks, like European Central Bank for example, we swap our currency, dollars for their currency, euros.
[02:01:30.013 --> 02:01:35.255]  They take the dollars, lend it out to the banks in their jurisdiction.
[02:01:35.255 --> 02:01:39.217]  That helps bring down interest rates in the global market for dollars.
[02:01:39.217 --> 02:01:42.338]  And meanwhile, we're not lending to those banks, we're lending to the central bank.
[02:01:42.338 --> 02:01:45.440]  The central bank is responsible for repaying us.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.160]  So who got the money?
[02:01:47.293 --> 02:01:50.674]  To financial institutions in Europe and other countries.
[02:01:50.674 --> 02:01:52.435]  Which ones?
[02:01:52.435 --> 02:01:54.576]  I don't know.
[02:01:54.576 --> 02:01:57.817]  Half a trillion dollars and you don't know who got the money?
[02:01:57.817 --> 02:02:07.920]  The loans go to the central banks and they then put them out to their institutions to try to bring down short-term interest rates in dollar markets around the world.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:10.641]  Well, let's start with which central banks got the money.
[02:02:10.641 --> 02:02:15.123]  There are 14 of them which are listed in our... I'm sure they're listed in here somewhere.
[02:02:16.833 --> 02:02:21.256]  Alright, so who actually made that decision to hand out a trillion dollars that way?
[02:02:21.256 --> 02:02:22.236]  Half a trillion dollars.
[02:02:22.236 --> 02:02:23.677]  Who made that decision?
[02:02:23.677 --> 02:02:25.618]  The Federal Open Market Committee.
[02:02:25.618 --> 02:02:28.620]  Okay, and was it done at one time or in a series of meetings?
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:30.621]  A series of meetings.
[02:02:30.621 --> 02:02:33.023]  And under what legal authority?
[02:02:33.023 --> 02:02:37.425]  We have a long-standing legal authority to do swaps with other central banks.
[02:02:37.425 --> 02:02:40.127]  It's not an emergency authority of any kind.
[02:02:40.127 --> 02:02:41.428]  Anything specific about it?
[02:02:47.156 --> 02:02:50.858]  My counsel says section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act.
[02:02:50.858 --> 02:02:56.622]  All right, we actually looked at one of the arrangements and one of the arrangements is $9 billion for New Zealand.
[02:02:56.622 --> 02:03:01.065]  That works out to $3,000 for every single person who lives in New Zealand.
[02:03:01.065 --> 02:03:07.529]  Seriously, wouldn't it have been better to extend that kind of credit to Americans rather than New Zealanders?
[02:03:07.529 --> 02:03:10.010]  It's not costing Americans anything.
[02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:11.832]  We're getting interest back and it comes back.
[02:03:11.832 --> 02:03:13.933]  It's not at the cost of any American credit.
[02:03:14.611 --> 02:03:16.252]  We are extending credit to Americans.
[02:03:16.252 --> 02:03:24.435]  Well, wouldn't it necessarily affect the credit markets if you extend half a trillion dollars in credit to anybody?
[02:03:24.435 --> 02:03:26.736]  We are lending to all U.S.
[02:03:26.736 --> 02:03:28.757]  financial institutions in exactly the same way.
[02:03:28.757 --> 02:03:30.038]  Well, look at the next page.
[02:03:30.038 --> 02:03:31.578]  The very next page has the U.S.
[02:03:31.578 --> 02:03:35.480]  dollar nominal exchange rate, which shows a 20% increase in U.S.
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.622]  dollar nominal exchange rate at exactly the same time that you were handing out half a trillion dollars to foreigners.
[02:03:40.622 --> 02:03:42.123]  Do you think that's a coincidence?
[02:03:44.628 --> 02:03:47.769]  Yes.
[02:03:47.769 --> 02:03:56.793]  Alright, well, the Constitution says no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.
[02:03:56.793 --> 02:03:58.694]  This money is not drawn from the Treasury.
[02:03:58.694 --> 02:04:00.395]  Well, let's talk about that.
[02:04:00.395 --> 02:04:11.680]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision in the Constitution for a group like the FMOC to hand out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners without any action by this Congress?
[02:04:13.067 --> 02:04:16.009]  Congress approved it in the Federal Reserve Act.
[02:04:16.009 --> 02:04:18.210]  When was that?
[02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:18.970]  Quite a long time ago.
[02:04:18.970 --> 02:04:20.531]  I don't know the exact date.
[02:04:20.531 --> 02:04:21.551]  A hundred years ago?
[02:04:21.551 --> 02:04:25.133]  The real act is 1914, I believe.
[02:04:25.133 --> 02:04:28.735]  I don't know whether this provision was in 1914 or not, but the Federal Reserve Act was in 1913.
[02:04:28.735 --> 02:04:35.238]  Alright, and at that time, the entire gross national product of this country was well under half a trillion dollars, wasn't it?
[02:04:36.269 --> 02:04:36.929]  I don't know.
[02:04:36.929 --> 02:04:44.714]  Is it safe to say that nobody in 1913 contemplated that your small little group of people would decide to hand down half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[02:04:46.983 --> 02:04:59.934]  This particular authority... Alright, we're coming back live, ladies and gentlemen, with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny on the latest flu development straight ahead on the one, the only, GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:59.934 --> 02:05:00.794]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:00.794 --> 02:05:04.177]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.177 --> 02:05:07.800]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:12.364]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.364 --> 02:05:13.785]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.985 --> 02:05:16.907]  We provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.907 --> 02:05:23.013]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:23.013 --> 02:05:26.636]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.636 --> 02:05:31.460]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:38.025]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:38.025 --> 02:05:39.947]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.447 --> 02:05:43.650]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:48.155]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.155 --> 02:05:50.377]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.377 --> 02:05:50.677]  877-327-0365.

[02:06:01.027 --> 02:06:08.774]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.774 --> 02:06:14.879]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[02:06:14.879 --> 02:06:17.542]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.822 --> 02:06:24.107]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:24.107 --> 02:06:28.171]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:28.171 --> 02:06:33.535]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.795 --> 02:06:35.876]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.876 --> 02:06:37.616]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.616 --> 02:06:40.137]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:40.137 --> 02:06:44.878]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.878 --> 02:06:48.580]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:51.701]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.701 --> 02:06:53.601]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.601 --> 02:06:55.722]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.308 --> 02:07:04.312]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.312 --> 02:07:09.659]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.659 --> 02:07:11.702]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.702 --> 02:07:16.288]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.288 --> 02:07:16.768]  We're good to go.
[02:07:39.696 --> 02:07:40.917]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.917 --> 02:07:41.817]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.817 --> 02:07:42.938]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.938 --> 02:07:43.858]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.858 --> 02:07:44.959]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.959 --> 02:07:48.001]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:48.001 --> 02:07:50.102]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:50.102 --> 02:07:55.545]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:55.545 --> 02:07:56.686]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:56.686 --> 02:08:06.411]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.411 --> 02:08:08.693]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:11.155 --> 02:08:15.977]  I'm looking at the latest headlines at PrisonPlanet.com in the featured news section.
[02:08:15.977 --> 02:08:21.380]  Swine flu document lists sports arena and mass vaccination centers.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:25.261]  We told you that was in all the previous documents, now it's being openly announced.
[02:08:25.261 --> 02:08:29.323]  Also, Obama will bypass Congress to detain suspects indefinitely.
[02:08:29.323 --> 02:08:32.925]  Poll, only 14% of Americans
[02:08:35.305 --> 02:08:39.689]  Believed Bush allowed 9-1-1 to happen, 8% unsure.
[02:08:39.689 --> 02:08:47.916]  That is the complete opposite of all of the other polls that have showed 84% believing they allowed it to happen.
[02:08:47.916 --> 02:08:52.119]  I mean, this poll is just an absolute fraud.
[02:08:52.119 --> 02:08:55.723]  We need to point that out if we post an article, some of the older polls.
[02:08:57.786 --> 02:09:00.527]  That is just the public policy polling.
[02:09:00.527 --> 02:09:04.089]  That poll flies the opposite of all other polls.
[02:09:04.089 --> 02:09:05.990]  Absolute fraud.
[02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:10.972]  Unbelievable how they're now putting out fake polls to counter all the hundreds of other real polls.
[02:09:10.972 --> 02:09:15.754]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had Congressman Ron Paul on, we had Congressman Alan Grayson on.
[02:09:15.754 --> 02:09:18.696]  That was the best interview that I have ever done.
[02:09:21.226 --> 02:09:22.347]  Today with Ron Paul.
[02:09:22.347 --> 02:09:29.552]  I will tell you that I'm very, very proud of the information that was covered there and that rebroadcast is coming up in an hour and 50 minutes.
[02:09:29.552 --> 02:09:37.938]  We'll have Ron Paul and the Congressman Alan Grayson interview coming back up as well.
[02:09:37.938 --> 02:09:47.244]  For the rest of this hour, the next hour we're getting reports live from the G20, the open announcement of world government and they're planning on the deal to start shutting down the dollar.
[02:09:47.244 --> 02:09:49.546]  All we have left is the dollar in our economy.
[02:09:50.728 --> 02:09:52.569]  That's all we produce is the fiat currency.
[02:09:52.569 --> 02:09:53.590]  This is curtains.
[02:09:53.590 --> 02:09:56.672]  As Ron Paul said, it's going to be the worst thing we've ever seen financially.
[02:09:56.672 --> 02:10:03.076]  This is... They staged the implosion last year to get everybody to go along with a handover of power to them.
[02:10:04.963 --> 02:10:06.424]  It's unspeakable.
[02:10:06.424 --> 02:10:11.207]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is a member of the prestigious National Speakers Association.
[02:10:11.207 --> 02:10:15.450]  Dr. Tenpenny is an outspoken advocate for free choice in health care.
[02:10:15.450 --> 02:10:21.754]  Dr. Tenpenny is a board-certified emergency medicine and osteopathic manipulative medicine.
[02:10:21.754 --> 02:10:31.481]  Prior to her career in alternative medicine, Dr. Tenpenny served as director of the emergency department of Blanchard Valley Regional Hospital Center in Findlay, Ohio in 1996.
[02:10:31.481 --> 02:10:33.703]  Dr. Tenpenny founded
[02:10:36.451 --> 02:10:42.576]  The Osteomed 2, expanding her practice and her vision of combining the best of conventional and alternative medicine.
[02:10:42.576 --> 02:10:56.608]  DrTinPenny.com is her website and her book is a bestseller, Foul, Bird Flu, It's Not What You Think, which is updated for the swine flu and explains the scam, what the shots do, what the adjuvants do, what the mercury does.
[02:10:56.608 --> 02:11:01.632]  We have it available and discounted at InfoWars.com, a secure online video bookstore shopping cart.
[02:11:01.632 --> 02:11:02.753]  You can call, it's all free to get it.
[02:11:02.753 --> 02:11:03.574]  I hope everybody gets it.
[02:11:04.795 --> 02:11:05.775]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:11:05.775 --> 02:11:06.796]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:11:33.806 --> 02:11:35.086]  You bet, it's good to have you here.
[02:11:35.086 --> 02:11:49.751]  You know, instead of me throwing out a bunch of questions about what do you think of the fear-mongering, what do you think of the adjuvants, what do you think of the announcements of sports stadiums, trying to force medical workers quietly to take it through color of law, just what do you think is most important right now?
[02:11:49.751 --> 02:11:53.872]  And give us a report on what you think is key.
[02:11:53.872 --> 02:11:58.333]  What I think is key is to do whatever you have to do to keep yourself healthy.
[02:11:59.011 --> 02:12:05.615]  And I've always been a big proponent, you know Alex, you and I have talked about this before, in terms of health is from the inside out.
[02:12:05.615 --> 02:12:10.659]  And what's happening externally in terms of the bug, there's not a big reason to be afraid of that.
[02:12:10.659 --> 02:12:14.041]  But you have to keep yourself healthy from the inside out.
[02:12:14.041 --> 02:12:21.345]  One of the problems though is that the FDA is going to make it increasingly more difficult for you to keep yourself healthy.
[02:12:21.345 --> 02:12:26.709]  They've been sending out letters since May of this year for any sort of vitamin and supplement company
[02:12:27.168 --> 02:12:32.351]  That is putting out supplements that says that it can protect you and boost your immune system against the flu.
[02:12:32.351 --> 02:12:46.720]  And if they've mentioned the H1N1 flu virus in any of their products, the FDA is sending them warning letters that are actually, could potentially cause them to, and threatening criminal prosecution of these people.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:54.465]  So it seems to me that they're trying to eliminate the competition and make it harder and harder for people to stay healthy and take care of themselves if they do get sick.
[02:12:57.824 --> 02:13:01.225]  They had a final ruling that came out today also about colloidal silver.
[02:13:01.225 --> 02:13:11.427]  I mean, I know that, or if it came out last week, I know that a lot of the people that I get a lot of emails from, and I'm sure you do too, they ask, you know, why don't I talk a lot about colloidal silver?
[02:13:11.427 --> 02:13:23.489]  Well, I had seen this coming down the road, and that the FDA was going to say it's not generally recommended as safe, and that they're taking regulatory action against the product that's marketed as a dietary supplement.
[02:13:24.239 --> 02:13:38.527]  Unless it's labeled in a very specific way, and it's marketed in a very specific way, and that it cannot be protected by the DSHEA Supplement Act if it says a topical gel or anything that's used on the skin.
[02:13:38.527 --> 02:13:40.188]  They've had this out there for a while.
[02:13:40.188 --> 02:13:51.354]  It's been out there since 1997, but the final ruling on this just came down last week on August, you know, just last Thursday, as a matter of fact, and it was listed in the Federal Register.
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:14:03.724]  That all over-the-counter drug products containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts are used for external use, are not generally recognized as safe and effective, and are misbranded.
[02:14:03.724 --> 02:14:19.430]  So it makes me nervous that it seems as though all of the products that we in the natural health community have used safely for years and have seen great results with it, whether it be vitamins, supplements, herbs, colloidal silver, it seems as though those products may be taken away from us.
[02:14:20.529 --> 02:14:30.632]  Well, you know, I've got colloidal silver generator, and I've got some I've bought, but I need to remind my wife to buy a whole bunch of the better products that are out there as they shut down this tool.
[02:14:30.632 --> 02:14:35.353]  You're a medical doctor, and I've had medical doctor after medical doctor after medical doctor on.
[02:14:35.353 --> 02:14:37.254]  In many cases, you aren't even involved in promoting it.
[02:14:37.774 --> 02:14:54.617]  And they say no, it's a very strong antiviral and antibacterial, and in a lot of studies, and I'm going to ask you if this is correct, it shows it's a lot better than Tamiflu or other things they're making all this money off of, but I guess they're saying as a doctor you're not allowed to practice medicine and say that, I mean, what do we know from the studies?
[02:14:54.617 --> 02:14:56.698]  I mean, what does cloyal silver do?
[02:14:56.698 --> 02:15:03.059]  Well, what they're saying in this FDA ruling, and this really comes right off of the FDA website, and the ruling went into effect September 16th.
[02:15:04.179 --> 02:15:19.024]  This is really kind of hot off the presses and what it says is that anything that people have seen, that there's no information about strength, quality, purity, and potency, and there was a lot of people who sent in and gave testimonials about different types of things.
[02:15:19.522 --> 02:15:27.649]  And they said that it was all anecdotal evidence, that nobody had submitted anything that proved anything to any kind of a drug quality, drug quality standard.
[02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:30.952]  But they've known for thousands of years that silver is a strong antibiotic.
[02:15:30.952 --> 02:15:33.694]  Right, and they're not allowing it to be grandfathered in.
[02:15:33.694 --> 02:15:45.444]  They're clear in that, they are very clear in that, that without evidence, and I'm reading right from the report, Alex, where it says, without evidence that the composition and labeling has not changed since 1938 or 1962,
[02:15:47.697 --> 02:15:49.219]  So by the way, specifically as a doctor,
[02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:56.630]  Oh no, we use it in our practice, we've used it for years.
[02:15:56.630 --> 02:15:57.610]  I mean, what does it do?
[02:15:57.610 --> 02:16:19.041]  Explain to people why micro-silver kills bacteria and viruses, when antibiotics only kill bacteria, antivirals only weaken viruses, and then it looks obvious to me that right as everybody's realizing this is something that the evidence has shown in the past has some good effects against flu and things, that they're now saying, you better not use this, you better not have it.
[02:16:19.744 --> 02:16:29.532]  And you better not use certain vitamins and you better not use certain herbals like medicinal mushrooms and things like that that boost up your own resistance to external microbes.
[02:16:29.532 --> 02:16:42.083]  Back to your question, I mean, the way that it's understood that how the silver particles work is that they go in and they cause the metabolism of the bug to stop working and they stop the replication of viruses and it lysis the cell membrane of bacteria and fungus.
[02:16:42.728 --> 02:16:56.332]  And I'm not an expert on the physiology of that, Alex, and I think there might be some loopholes for some of the manufacturers, but I have seen FDA warning letters that went out a while ago to people who are manufacturers of this.
[02:16:56.332 --> 02:17:08.975]  And I guess my point, when you asked me what I think was important, is that we have a lot of tools in the natural health community to not only get us well after we've been sick so that we can avoid things like Tamiflu,
[02:17:09.417 --> 02:17:15.620]  But that we can build up our own resistance and build up our own internal strength against these microbes.
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:27.866]  And it looks as though at every turn, not only are they promoting this vaccine and everybody has to be vaccinated, and I know you've talked about this a lot, and a lot of the writings and the radio I've been on, too, has been a lot about the vaccine.
[02:17:27.866 --> 02:17:31.328]  But it's like, what else can we do to keep ourselves healthy?
[02:17:31.328 --> 02:17:37.351]  It's concerning to me that it looks like a lot of these tools are being shut down by the FDA and FDA also.
[02:17:38.692 --> 02:17:41.394]  Well, it's outrageous.
[02:17:41.394 --> 02:17:56.983]  I mean, I've read the reports, we've had medical doctor after medical doctor on, and I have gone back and seen studies over the last hundred years about tiny silver particles just shredding viruses and bacteria.
[02:17:56.983 --> 02:18:01.385]  It's like holy water to a vampire.
[02:18:01.385 --> 02:18:03.686]  I mean, I've got it for my family.
[02:18:06.877 --> 02:18:14.562]  I've seen the studies that elderberry might be bad because it could actually cause a hemorrhagic immune response and jack up your immune system and trigger something.
[02:18:14.562 --> 02:18:18.745]  I don't understand all the properties of that, so we're not going to use that.
[02:18:18.745 --> 02:18:20.867]  And then I guess in America, they could come after you.
[02:18:20.867 --> 02:18:22.648]  I'm not even allowed to ask you a medical doctor.
[02:18:22.648 --> 02:18:30.593]  I mean, I guess get sun, because vitamin D helps, especially the type that the skin produces.
[02:18:30.593 --> 02:18:32.374]  I guess I'm not allowed to ask you if that's good.
[02:18:32.374 --> 02:18:35.517]  I guess I'm not allowed to ask if getting a lot of sleep is good and being healthy.
[02:18:36.737 --> 02:18:37.578]  I guess I'm not allowed.
[02:18:37.578 --> 02:18:40.339]  I mean, what are you doing for yourself?
[02:18:40.339 --> 02:18:50.783]  Well, we're doing things like alkaline water and lots of vitamin C, lots of vitamin D, vitamin A. Trying to get fresh air.
[02:18:50.783 --> 02:18:52.284]  You know, all the things that I talk about.
[02:18:52.284 --> 02:18:56.045]  Exercise, sleep, fresh air, fresh water, good food.
[02:18:56.045 --> 02:18:58.687]  Try to eat as organic as much as we can.
[02:18:58.687 --> 02:19:00.447]  Try to get some little bit of exercise.
[02:19:00.447 --> 02:19:03.349]  Get out of the chair and away from the computer and do some exercise.
[02:19:04.742 --> 02:19:07.263]  And I think that that's what's really, really important.
[02:19:07.263 --> 02:19:13.186]  And the other thing is a lot of, you know, our emotions play a big role in what happens to our bodies also.
[02:19:13.186 --> 02:19:23.111]  And if you live in that state of fear, that big fear factor, what that does is it suppresses your cortisol levels and it makes your, it increases your cortisol levels and makes you more susceptible to illness and disease.
[02:19:23.956 --> 02:19:28.138]  So, my husband and I, we just don't live in a fear-based place about all this stuff.
[02:19:28.138 --> 02:19:39.183]  We sort of look at it and say, I'm not going to get the vaccine, I'm not going to do it, and whatever happens is going to happen, and if I have to self-quarantine and pull up in my house with food and vitamins and water, that's what I'm going to do.
[02:19:39.183 --> 02:19:40.723]  While you can still get vitamins.
[02:19:40.723 --> 02:19:41.804]  While you can still get it.
[02:19:43.068 --> 02:19:44.429]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, stay there.
[02:19:44.429 --> 02:19:53.355]  I want to get into the fact that Dr. Monteith has a flu report from the CDC saying it's going to peak the middle of next month, right when all the vaccine injections get going.
[02:19:53.355 --> 02:19:58.839]  I want to get into adverse reactions in Europe from the vaccine and other vaccines.
[02:19:58.839 --> 02:20:00.060]  The forced inoculations.
[02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:01.081]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.081 --> 02:20:02.762]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:20:02.762 --> 02:20:04.523]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:20:04.523 --> 02:20:11.908]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[02:21:09.602 --> 02:21:13.785]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:21:13.785 --> 02:21:15.726]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:21:15.726 --> 02:21:17.968]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:21:18.268 --> 02:21:18.848]  We're good to go.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.780]  It is a big idea.
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:44.361]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:22:06.875 --> 02:22:09.936]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:22:09.936 --> 02:22:12.756]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:12.756 --> 02:22:15.557]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:22:15.557 --> 02:22:18.738]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:22:18.738 --> 02:22:26.039]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:22:29.093 --> 02:22:34.517]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:22:34.517 --> 02:22:38.399]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:22:38.399 --> 02:22:40.961]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:22:40.961 --> 02:22:42.142]  Most people have no idea.
[02:22:42.142 --> 02:22:42.922]  They're not after money.
[02:22:42.922 --> 02:22:44.203]  They have all the money they need.
[02:22:44.203 --> 02:22:45.184]  They're after power.
[02:22:45.184 --> 02:22:46.325]  That's what they're after these days.

[02:23:05.177 --> 02:23:18.627]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to FluScam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[02:23:18.627 --> 02:23:30.216]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.

[02:24:03.837 --> 02:24:18.721]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[02:24:18.721 --> 02:24:26.203]  Sherry, I want to get into the open announcements trying to force police, firefighters, military, medical workers to take the shots, threatening to fire them.
[02:24:27.591 --> 02:24:39.519]  But also just the vaccine manufacturing process, the adjuvants, the fact that Dr. Monteith, medical doctor, was on with us yesterday and he talked in detail.
[02:24:39.519 --> 02:24:51.668]  And we went to the CDC's own website and they admitted that upwards of 37% of people they've tested in the US and also in Australia have been found to have the H1N1 and didn't even get sick from it.
[02:24:51.668 --> 02:24:53.149]  And it appears to be very mild.
[02:24:56.372 --> 02:24:59.455]  And this whole thing, we know they've been secretly preparing for it since January.
[02:24:59.455 --> 02:25:01.276]  Give us your take on that.
[02:25:01.276 --> 02:25:07.481]  Well, it's not that much different than what was happening with the bird flu with H5N1, Alex, three years ago.
[02:25:07.481 --> 02:25:17.670]  And that they were saying that there were tens of thousands more people in Southeast Asia and China and that part of the world that had been infected and weren't even sick enough to go to the doctor.
[02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:22.934]  And yet the ones that were the most sick and in the hospital and perhaps had a fatal or a bad outcome,
[02:25:23.592 --> 02:25:31.770]  Those were the ones that they were using only for those for the statistics so that if they had admitted 100 people to the hospital and 50 people died, they call it a 50% death rate.
[02:25:33.268 --> 02:25:44.950]  But the truth is, if 100 people went to the hospital and there were 10 or 20,000 people who were sick enough to not even, or who weren't even sick enough to go to the doctor, that changes the denominator.
[02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:48.971]  It makes the death rate, you know, some infinitesimally small number.
[02:25:48.971 --> 02:25:51.472]  And I don't think it's any different now with the swine flu.
[02:25:51.472 --> 02:25:57.413]  I mean, they've said that they thought that by flu season this year, almost a third of the general population in the U.S.
[02:25:57.413 --> 02:25:58.933]  would have either been exposed
[02:25:59.395 --> 02:26:02.156]  Or would have been sick by the H1N1 virus.
[02:26:02.156 --> 02:26:04.096]  So what is the big deal?
[02:26:04.096 --> 02:26:15.580]  They say it's highly infective, but it has a low virulence, which means a lot of people can get it, a lot of people can spread it around, but not very many people get sick from it.
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:18.301]  Continue breaking that down.
[02:26:18.301 --> 02:26:20.782]  In terms of?
[02:26:20.782 --> 02:26:21.682]  What do you mean?
[02:26:21.682 --> 02:26:24.703]  Why are they hyping it then if it's no big deal?
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:29.543]  They really want us to get this vaccine for one reason or another.
[02:26:29.543 --> 02:26:35.167]  And one of the things that I've said for a while is that this is either phase three.
[02:26:35.167 --> 02:26:42.192]  This is like if you're in the Navy and you have to do all of these final checks before you launch the ship out to the ocean.
[02:26:42.192 --> 02:26:51.439]  This is either the final test to make sure that all of the implementation things are in place before they pull the big trigger in the final one.
[02:26:51.439 --> 02:26:54.521]  Because it's looking less and less like this is going to be it.
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.641]  You know, we've had three trial runs.
[02:26:56.641 --> 02:27:02.044]  We've had SARS, we've had H5N1, and now we've had this one, the H1N1.
[02:27:02.044 --> 02:27:03.084]  They're talking about it.
[02:27:03.084 --> 02:27:04.985]  Is it going to ramp up this winter?
[02:27:04.985 --> 02:27:12.289]  And wouldn't it be a coincidence if it ramped up right around October 15th when the vaccine was supposed to be delivered?
[02:27:12.289 --> 02:27:21.734]  And, you know, they've got these emergency utilization authorizations that are sitting back in the backdrop, the EUAs, which have been put into place by the 2006 PREP Act.
[02:27:23.348 --> 02:27:23.688]  I think so.
[02:27:44.998 --> 02:27:45.659]  Let me stop you.
[02:27:45.659 --> 02:27:53.348]  I want to go through that, but you're saying pull the trigger on the big event, all these little events, dry runs to set up the medical tyranny infrastructure.
[02:27:53.348 --> 02:27:56.112]  Ron Paul talked about that last hour.
[02:27:56.112 --> 02:28:01.798]  Are you saying they may release something else or try to do a forced inoculation?
[02:28:01.798 --> 02:28:02.780]  What is the big event?
[02:28:03.564 --> 02:28:10.028]  Well, either that, the virus gets suddenly worse, either something is released.
[02:28:10.028 --> 02:28:23.878]  It seems so weird, Alex, that if something was really made in nature, which they're trying to make us believe, would suddenly have a ramp up, and particularly since everything coming out of South America and the Southern Hemisphere says that it didn't ramp up at all down there.
[02:28:23.878 --> 02:28:33.264]  So could it be that they're going to have another test tube made virus that could be released at some major event in the winter?
[02:28:33.891 --> 02:28:50.787]  You know, we've got the Winter Olympics that are coming up this winter, and it makes me nervous to think that there'll be people that will be going to Vancouver from all over the world, and in the middle of the wintertime, and is that a point in time where the virus may be contracted, be worse, and be spread by just the humans going back home?
[02:28:51.334 --> 02:28:54.255]  Doctor, we're about to break, but I want to spend time on this in the next segment.
[02:28:54.255 --> 02:29:02.019]  I want to flesh this out, because this is what every other medical doctor I have on says they believe is being set up.
[02:29:02.019 --> 02:29:06.120]  And my dad called me Sunday night and said, check your email.
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:07.241]  And I didn't see it.
[02:29:07.241 --> 02:29:09.682]  I need to call him and find out what he was talking about.
[02:29:09.682 --> 02:29:11.743]  He said he got a CDC report.
[02:29:12.543 --> 02:29:15.266]  I've read a little bit of that, but I haven't perhaps read the
[02:29:30.570 --> 02:29:37.815]  But that's exactly what you're saying, because we see this massive build-up, troops suddenly popping up on the streets all over the US and Europe.
[02:29:37.815 --> 02:29:38.876]  Stay there.
[02:29:38.876 --> 02:29:43.139]  Let's talk about how this may unfold, because we've never seen such a build-up at this level.
[02:29:43.139 --> 02:29:44.980]  Dr. Sherri Tenpenny is our guest.
[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:46.861]  DrTenpenny.com is her website.
[02:29:46.861 --> 02:29:51.624]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.624 --> 02:29:53.005]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.005 --> 02:29:55.547]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.547 --> 02:29:58.229]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.776 --> 02:30:05.020]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:07.022]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.022 --> 02:30:15.551]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.551 --> 02:30:21.096]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.096 --> 02:30:22.718]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.938 --> 02:30:29.460]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:40.502]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.502 --> 02:30:41.283]  That's right.
[02:30:41.283 --> 02:30:43.843]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.843 --> 02:30:45.444]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.004 --> 02:31:05.931]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.931 --> 02:31:08.012]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:08.012 --> 02:31:10.453]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.453 --> 02:31:12.734]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.734 --> 02:31:14.355]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.355 --> 02:31:15.395]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.635 --> 02:31:24.057]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:33:15.355 --> 02:33:19.642]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[02:33:32.276 --> 02:33:44.021]  Doctor, continuing along the line that you've gotten into about all the evidence showing pointing towards them releasing something more deadly or knowing it's going to mutate.
[02:33:44.021 --> 02:33:48.943]  The CDC report saying it may mutate into something extremely deadly.
[02:33:48.943 --> 02:33:50.223]  Continue.
[02:33:50.223 --> 02:33:53.705]  I read a report, I think it was a couple of days ago, and I just skimmed it.
[02:33:53.705 --> 02:34:01.288]  I didn't really read at the details of it, but it was talking about the H1N1 morphing into something and being a different subtype.
[02:34:01.724 --> 02:34:03.525]  And I thought, well, isn't that just interesting?
[02:34:03.525 --> 02:34:12.530]  We've just spent $10 billion manufacturing a vaccine by five different companies and bottling it all up, and even their stuff isn't going to work.
[02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:20.274]  You know, if this is really true, that the virus is going to going to morph, and they claim that in order for the vaccine to work, it needs to be an exact match.
[02:34:20.274 --> 02:34:29.238]  Except, of course, Nancy Cox, who once in a while has said, and I talked about it in my book, Foul, where she said, well, you know, sometimes if it's a close match, it'll be okay.
[02:34:29.238 --> 02:34:30.619]  So how close is close enough?
[02:34:31.476 --> 02:34:39.863]  You know, is the vaccine going to be, even in their own mind, is it going to be good enough to protect against this more, very much stronger, more virulent virus?
[02:34:39.863 --> 02:34:46.188]  Because at that point, it won't match the virus that's in the vaccine anyway.
[02:34:46.188 --> 02:34:58.639]  What about, for the last month, all these nursing associations and nurses and their husbands and wives have been calling me, sending me letters now, we've posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, where they're told
[02:34:59.775 --> 02:35:01.656]  Three different things in different letters.
[02:35:01.656 --> 02:35:03.836]  You take the shot or you're fired.
[02:35:03.836 --> 02:35:08.478]  You take the shot or you wear a mask for six months or you're fired.
[02:35:08.478 --> 02:35:11.499]  Or we'd like you to take the shot.
[02:35:11.499 --> 02:35:14.060]  But it's all three.
[02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:16.141]  And then now at schools they're not even asking.
[02:35:16.141 --> 02:35:17.902]  They're just telling parents you've got to do it.
[02:35:17.902 --> 02:35:20.943]  They're now making the nurses take the regular seasonal flu shot.
[02:35:20.943 --> 02:35:21.883]  This is confirmed.
[02:35:21.883 --> 02:35:24.224]  It's now come out in mainstream news weeks after we covered it.
[02:35:24.924 --> 02:35:34.487]  And Obama does this military tactic of denying so everybody kind of stands down so our opposition can't articulate what's happening and build to resist.
[02:35:34.487 --> 02:35:47.592]  The polls show the majority of people don't want to be forced to take it and don't want to take it, but there's this whole kind of quiet, under-the-radar program, and I've talked to nurse after nurse and firefighter after firefighter, they tell them
[02:35:48.803 --> 02:35:49.764]  You gotta take this.
[02:35:49.764 --> 02:35:53.065]  Many have already been forced to take it at Seton Hospitals here in Austin.
[02:35:53.065 --> 02:35:56.187]  And don't tell anybody we made you do this or you're fired.
[02:35:56.187 --> 02:36:00.009]  I mean, it's like a huge curtain of tyranny.
[02:36:00.009 --> 02:36:02.991]  And oppression is lowering over us.
[02:36:02.991 --> 02:36:13.396]  I certainly hope that a lot of those people that heard that will be brave enough to maybe partner with several other people who were told the same thing and come forward and expose that.
[02:36:13.396 --> 02:36:18.259]  Because now we're talking about American against American and neighbor against neighbor.
[02:36:18.703 --> 02:36:21.924]  And even friend against friend doing these sorts of things?
[02:36:21.924 --> 02:36:25.245]  This really is tyrannical, those sorts of things.
[02:36:25.245 --> 02:36:39.769]  And people have got to be brave enough to be able to stand up and step out and say, and expose the people that are saying this, and that they can expose the person who told them to say that, because then finally we'll go far enough down into the rat hole, we'll find the rat.
[02:36:39.769 --> 02:36:48.352]  It was giving these sort of orders and making this be that we have to take this medication and have one American have to be forcibly giving it to another.
[02:36:49.674 --> 02:37:00.758]  I have studied the Rockefellers deeply, and I know you have as well, but so has Dr. Blaylock, and every researcher we have on has the same intel because we're just researching their own statements.
[02:37:00.758 --> 02:37:12.802]  The big private corporation that manages New York City that the Rockefellers set up, tied into 9-11, tied into the big vaccine makers, tied into all the key players, and I read Horowitz's affidavit
[02:37:13.542 --> 02:37:18.424]  Remember, he predicted the anthrax attacks before they happened, and then with precision said who did it and how.
[02:37:18.424 --> 02:37:33.812]  So, you know, sometimes you take, I take what he does as kind of, whoa, that's extreme, but then he's proven right down the road, so I've got to look at his affidavit, and then I've done my own research, reading the affidavit, where he's going to the FBI saying, here are the criminals, they did it.
[02:37:33.812 --> 02:37:35.032]  Very bold.
[02:37:35.032 --> 02:37:42.516]  Have you, A, read his affidavit, and what do you think of this whole racketeering operation that he says is going on?
[02:37:43.286 --> 02:37:46.810]  I have read his affidavit.
[02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:48.372]  I have to say that I haven't studied it.
[02:37:49.148 --> 02:37:51.290]  And I haven't really connected all the dots.
[02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:58.214]  I do know that when I was reading through it, it seemed as though I did have questions of saying there seemed to be some gaps in some of the connections there.
[02:37:58.214 --> 02:37:59.756]  And that's my opinion.
[02:37:59.756 --> 02:38:03.878]  And again, I didn't go through and study every single one of those line item things.
[02:38:03.878 --> 02:38:06.460]  But I do believe that there's enough evidence there.
[02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:15.947]  There's enough evidence that somebody who is on our side of the equation, on our table, needs to sit up and take notice and follow through with some of the things that he's talking about.
[02:38:16.274 --> 02:38:26.547]  I mean, in any sort of a lawsuit of any kind, even if it's a car accident, there are certainly elements that have little missing links and some assumptions that can be made.
[02:38:26.547 --> 02:38:31.754]  And I do believe that there's things there that do need to be investigated, no doubt.
[02:38:32.938 --> 02:38:41.822]  I want to open the phones up specifically for questions on the flu, the level six pandemic declared when it's really not a pandemic according to medical doctors we've talked to.
[02:38:41.822 --> 02:38:45.184]  They've changed the scale to call it a pandemic when it's not.
[02:38:45.184 --> 02:38:48.486]  I'd like you to speak to that, but I want to take calls.
[02:38:48.486 --> 02:38:48.606]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:38:48.606 --> 02:38:50.807]  But only on the flu and the whole martial law situation.
[02:38:50.807 --> 02:38:50.867]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:38:59.798 --> 02:39:04.700]  Specifically, and Ron Paul agrees, this is a medical tyranny.
[02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:10.482]  First they say we're taking your rights for shadowy people in turbines in Central Asia, in Afghanistan.
[02:39:10.482 --> 02:39:22.225]  Then they go, oh, well really DHS and Homeland Security and NORTHCOM are for the American people, and yeah, the Patriot Act is being used and non-terror related, and we don't need warrants anymore to take your blood at checkpoints or bust in your house.
[02:39:23.866 --> 02:39:26.447]  But that's not even good enough.
[02:39:26.447 --> 02:39:29.448]  It's perfect to then say everybody could have the flu.
[02:39:29.448 --> 02:39:31.309]  Everybody could be carrying it.
[02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:34.230]  And it's just a perfect excuse to further expand under U.N.
[02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:36.511]  control the takeover of nation states.
[02:39:36.511 --> 02:39:39.232]  And under Level 6, we are under U.N.
[02:39:39.232 --> 02:39:40.132]  control right now.
[02:39:40.132 --> 02:39:43.113]  I mean, do you get what I'm saying here?
[02:39:43.113 --> 02:39:47.475]  That flu is the perfect thing to create the ultimate boogeyman?
[02:39:47.475 --> 02:39:48.735]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:48.735 --> 02:39:51.356]  And I'm in total agreement, Alex, with everything that you just said.
[02:39:51.946 --> 02:40:01.275]  Because one thing has led to another, and the thing that bothers me about all of this is that, you know, somebody's out there making those FEMA camps.
[02:40:01.275 --> 02:40:04.758]  Somebody's hammering nail into wood.
[02:40:04.758 --> 02:40:07.420]  Somebody is making those shots and giving them to people.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:11.024]  Somebody is putting documents in place and signing their names.
[02:40:11.024 --> 02:40:17.770]  And who those somebodies are are our neighbors, our friends, people we go to church with, people that are in our schools, our soccer teams.
[02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:28.043]  Why is it that people who are doing those things can't see what's happening and stop and let's all band together and it's really us Americans.
[02:40:28.043 --> 02:40:29.705]  There's 300 million of us and 550 of them.
[02:40:32.812 --> 02:40:45.795]  We've got the resistance, we've got the power of the people here, we've got numbers, but yet we have allowed that, them, that small set of 554 of them down in Washington, D.C., to pull all this wool over our eyes.
[02:40:45.795 --> 02:40:50.836]  I think it's really time that we all stand up and set aside our differences and say enough is enough.
[02:40:50.836 --> 02:40:52.676]  Just like that 9-12 march.
[02:40:52.676 --> 02:40:54.817]  I mean, I don't, you know, when I looked at that, to me,
[02:40:55.436 --> 02:41:01.438]  It really wasn't about what side of the equation you were on, or what you were saying, or where your politics happened to stand.
[02:41:01.438 --> 02:41:07.721]  It was the fact that people were willing to get out of their chairs, spend money, go to Washington, and make their voice be heard.
[02:41:07.721 --> 02:41:12.283]  And I think that on a state-by-state, community-by-community level, this is what we need to do.
[02:41:14.343 --> 02:41:17.043]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:41:17.043 --> 02:41:21.204]  Doctor, what about adverse reactions from the flu trials?
[02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:26.645]  We've had nurses calling in saying that when they get the shots, everybody's arm basically becomes paralyzed.
[02:41:26.645 --> 02:41:35.667]  We have the internal CDC report about neurological problems linked to previous vaccines and possibly to this one.
[02:41:35.667 --> 02:41:37.467]  What's the intel on that now?
[02:41:37.467 --> 02:41:42.908]  Well, I heard a report out of, it was just, it was a rumored report, but it was a report that came out of Oklahoma.
[02:41:43.325 --> 02:41:52.973]  That said, that there was a small hospital where the doctors all got together and said they weren't going to take it, and neither were the nurses, and they weren't going to give it to anybody because they had heard the same sort of things.
[02:41:52.973 --> 02:41:59.898]  That out of these clinical trials, that there was a lot of adverse reactions that were not being reported at all.
[02:41:59.898 --> 02:42:01.920]  And, you know, that's another thing.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:07.184]  If there's anybody out there that's been forced to take this by a nurse or paramedics or first responders,
[02:42:07.543 --> 02:42:16.028]  They need to be very vocal about it, and let everybody else know the type of reactions that they had, because it's not going to be reported by the CDC.
[02:42:16.028 --> 02:42:24.033]  And, you know, with YouTube that we have now, and blogs, and the internet, there are ways that we can make our voice be heard.
[02:42:24.033 --> 02:42:26.474]  So I really think there's going to be a lot of problems with this.
[02:42:26.474 --> 02:42:30.637]  Now, the CDC has already loaded their side of the deck on that, though, Alex.
[02:42:30.637 --> 02:42:37.101]  They've already put up PowerPoint presentations and had other speakers who are from the CDC say, yes, yes, yes, of course.
[02:42:37.526 --> 02:42:44.401]  Because we're going to have so many people vaccinated at the same time, the percentage risk of vaccination injury is going to go up.
[02:42:44.401 --> 02:42:47.147]  So we expect that and that's going to be acceptable.
[02:42:47.147 --> 02:42:48.250]  Well, it's not acceptable.
[02:42:50.435 --> 02:42:55.338]  Well, I've got a report here at InfoWars.net from Steve Watson.
[02:42:55.338 --> 02:43:00.701]  Swine flu document lists sports arena as max vaccination center.
[02:43:00.701 --> 02:43:02.222]  And we've always known that was the plan.
[02:43:02.222 --> 02:43:03.782]  People ask, where are the FEMA camps?
[02:43:03.782 --> 02:43:09.366]  And Congress admits, and the New York Times admits, they've built certain FEMA camps, six big ones across the country.
[02:43:10.306 --> 02:43:10.627]  I don't
[02:43:27.809 --> 02:43:39.314]  And they're now kind of floating the trial balloon of, oh, well, you don't have to take the shot, but you can't fly, you can't get on a bus, you can't drive to work, and you're going to have to wear a bracelet.
[02:43:39.314 --> 02:43:41.675]  Digital Angel, the Verichip company, got a patent.
[02:43:41.675 --> 02:43:50.038]  Their stock went up 200 plus percent the other day, where you have to take a chip to prove you've had it.
[02:43:50.038 --> 02:43:52.119]  That's AP reporting that.
[02:43:52.119 --> 02:43:53.639]  I mean, this is 1984, what we're seeing.
[02:43:55.365 --> 02:44:11.774]  Alex, it's exactly what I've been saying for the last six months, that I really don't think that the government at any level, whether it's state or local, has quite the power in this big country that's spread out across everywhere to make everybody show up at a certain place and force them to get a vaccine.
[02:44:11.774 --> 02:44:15.216]  But they can make it really, really hard to refuse it.
[02:44:15.216 --> 02:44:18.338]  And the really hard to refuse it is that list of things that you already said.
[02:44:18.769 --> 02:44:38.960]  You know, you can't go to places where there's large congregations, which could be church, could be the grocery store, could be if you have a place of employment that has more than 30 or 40 people, that they would hire a security guard at the door, and you have to either show your digital chip or your card that looks like a driver's license, or a bracelet, or anything like that.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:46.865]  And, you know, I'm just this doctor out here in Cleveland, Ohio, and if I can think of that, and you can think of that,
[02:44:47.369 --> 02:44:51.473]  Certainly, those who would be making those sorts of tools could be thinking of that.
[02:44:51.473 --> 02:44:54.135]  No, they're saying that's what they're going to do under Level 6.
[02:44:54.135 --> 02:45:01.042]  I know, and I've been saying it for six months, that that was probably, that I was very suspicious that that was coming down the road.
[02:45:01.042 --> 02:45:07.988]  So now it's just coming out into full view, and the playbook is being opened up, and more and more people are hearing about it.
[02:45:08.459 --> 02:45:08.959]  You're right.
[02:45:08.959 --> 02:45:11.301]  We're a 90% urban society.
[02:45:11.301 --> 02:45:14.443]  When we had the Great Depression, we were 20% urban.
[02:45:14.443 --> 02:45:16.544]  We're totally dependent on government.
[02:45:16.544 --> 02:45:21.708]  The highways were designed by the Pentagon and President Eisenhower, and the Pentagon brags.
[02:45:21.708 --> 02:45:23.409]  This is how they control our society.
[02:45:23.409 --> 02:45:24.950]  They control the resources.
[02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:26.511]  They control our currency.
[02:45:26.511 --> 02:45:37.979]  The UN, Maury Strong, the head of their program in 92 at the Rio de Janeiro Summit, we have his quotes in the new film, said they were going to de-industrialize us to make us go into their control for eugenics.
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:47.989]  And this may be the big final giant beta test to then launch the main attack in the next two to three years or this could be it.
[02:45:47.989 --> 02:45:54.176]  And I think they're gauging, testing the public, testing our response and have it in between
[02:45:55.934 --> 02:45:58.336]  Red light and green light.
[02:45:58.336 --> 02:46:05.963]  They are looking and I believe in the next week or two are going to make the decision and I've really learned how to guess what they're going to do.
[02:46:05.963 --> 02:46:13.770]  They're making the decision whether this is the final beta test or if they're going to go live right now and God help us.
[02:46:13.770 --> 02:46:18.975]  You know there was a report that came out from a meeting that happened in Washington just a couple weeks ago.
[02:46:19.474 --> 02:46:26.059]  And one of the people from the autism community from Safe Minds wrote a report about what was happening at that meeting.
[02:46:26.059 --> 02:46:40.569]  And they were talking about what level the insider, the flu vaccine people who were all there, there were only two people who were non-government and CDC employee insiders at this meeting, and it was an invitation-only meeting.
[02:46:40.569 --> 02:46:46.694]  And Barbara Lowe Fisher, and I'm sorry, I can't remember the other woman's name, but she's from Safe Minds, was at this meeting and she wrote a report.
[02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:54.135]  And said that, you know, most people, when they went out and did those town hall meetings, that the vast majority of people said they needed to go slow.
[02:46:54.135 --> 02:46:56.497]  Either very slow, intermediate, or fast.
[02:46:56.497 --> 02:47:01.221]  And it was the government officials who said, we need to take this at the highest level, and we need to vaccinate everybody.
[02:47:01.221 --> 02:47:01.702]  It was 55% of them.
[02:47:03.479 --> 02:47:04.980]  Well, let me confirm what you're saying.
[02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:13.544]  We had Wayne Madsen, who went to that big, international, somewhat government-run swine flu symposium three weeks ago in D.C.
[02:47:13.544 --> 02:47:16.325]  We got their internal program and the cover.
[02:47:16.325 --> 02:47:22.588]  In fact, we broke that it was originally happening as a listener in D.C., sent it to us, and then we covered it all.
[02:47:22.588 --> 02:47:24.289]  And no, that was discussed openly!
[02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:39.453]  And then, one of the government people said, kick the media out of here, turn off recording devices, and the whole thing was about what will the public accept, and now we broke at PrisonPlanet.com last week an article that had the government document in it.
[02:47:39.453 --> 02:47:46.434]  They're sending to business owners, even small ones, and the questionnaires there saying, will you forcibly inoculate your employees?
[02:47:46.434 --> 02:47:47.815]  Will you do what you're told?
[02:47:47.815 --> 02:47:49.295]  Will you go to quarantine centers?
[02:47:49.295 --> 02:47:52.676]  So it's confirmed, the feds are testing with their antennae
[02:47:53.636 --> 02:47:54.817]  Alex, what's the solution here?
[02:47:54.817 --> 02:48:01.321]  How do we mobilize people to make a decision of what they're going to do to protect their families and their communities?
[02:48:01.321 --> 02:48:02.201]  What's the how-to?
[02:48:02.201 --> 02:48:05.263]  We send out a lot of information.
[02:48:05.263 --> 02:48:07.745]  You give information hour after hour every day.
[02:48:22.984 --> 02:48:31.555]  I do a lot of radio, I'm on the internet a lot, I write a lot of articles, and the bottom line is people say, okay, this is great, I'm hearing what you're saying, but what should I do?
[02:48:31.555 --> 02:48:32.396]  What's my how-to?
[02:48:33.211 --> 02:48:36.734]  Well, I mean, we can't tell you to get Sunshine and get Colloidal Silver.
[02:48:36.734 --> 02:48:40.977]  I mean, we're telling you they're going to set up checkpoints and they decide to drop the hammer.
[02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:47.522]  All I can do is try to reach as many people as I can and spend most of my time trying to fund my operation.
[02:48:47.522 --> 02:48:50.524]  I mean, it's not a powerlessness.
[02:48:50.524 --> 02:48:54.927]  We know we're reaching more people than ever, but it doesn't look like it's enough soon enough.
[02:48:56.568 --> 02:48:56.908]  I don't know.
[02:48:56.908 --> 02:48:58.209]  What are the solutions, doctor?
[02:48:58.209 --> 02:49:05.791]  I mean, all I can do is sit here and go, okay, Bayer knowingly put HIV and hepatitis in all these shots and killed all these people, MSNBC.
[02:49:05.791 --> 02:49:08.392]  Okay, they nerve gas troops and Project Shad.
[02:49:08.392 --> 02:49:11.493]  Okay, they radiated foster children, 4,300 of them.
[02:49:11.493 --> 02:49:13.554]  I wouldn't trust anything this government does.
[02:49:13.554 --> 02:49:15.795]  Okay, the White House science czar.
[02:49:16.395 --> 02:49:16.596]  I think?
[02:49:33.456 --> 02:49:34.156]  Hitler's bad!
[02:49:34.156 --> 02:49:35.216]  Hitler's bad!
[02:49:35.216 --> 02:49:36.177]  Hitler's bad!
[02:49:36.177 --> 02:49:38.937]  I send my guys to Pennsylvania.
[02:49:38.937 --> 02:49:42.718]  They go up and ask to speak to the military liaison officer.
[02:49:42.718 --> 02:49:45.659]  The police come and say they're terrorists and put them on terror list.
[02:49:45.659 --> 02:49:48.200]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:50.940]  So, is there any hope?
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:52.681]  I mean, what do we do?
[02:49:52.681 --> 02:49:58.122]  I mean, you're absolutely right and nobody can refute your research or your data or anything that you say.
[02:49:58.564 --> 02:50:04.351]  But when all politics is local and all protection happens within the confines of your own town.
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:09.643]  So we have to get people to not be afraid of their neighbors.
[02:50:09.643 --> 02:50:11.444]  To go and talk to other people.
[02:50:11.444 --> 02:50:17.408]  Let them know to go to Prison Planet and to InfoWars and read the material and listen to your show.
[02:50:17.408 --> 02:50:18.888]  And listen to what I have to say.
[02:50:18.888 --> 02:50:25.072]  Go to PandemicFluOnline and download those flyers and hand them out to everybody that they know.
[02:50:25.072 --> 02:50:31.356]  And let everybody in their neighborhood know that when they start coming to your door, this is what's going to happen.
[02:50:31.356 --> 02:50:33.097]  And if you take the shot, this is what might happen.
[02:50:34.675 --> 02:50:39.640]  And you better know that a shot they're trying to make you take is bad.
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:44.464]  I mean, their history, when they try to force something, this is the hot needle.
[02:50:44.464 --> 02:50:48.047]  Dr. Tim Penney, stay there, I want to come back and take some calls with you.
[02:50:48.047 --> 02:50:55.794]  DrTimPenney.com, we'll put it up on screen for everybody who's also watching at PrisonPlanet.tv with Samuel Kass, the radio show there.
[02:50:55.794 --> 02:50:57.415]  I got a wife and three children.
[02:50:57.415 --> 02:51:00.298]  I got a grandmother, I got my parents, and I am so angry.
[02:51:02.901 --> 02:51:06.304]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:51:06.304 --> 02:51:09.966]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:51:09.966 --> 02:51:14.570]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:19.173]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:51:19.173 --> 02:51:25.338]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:51:25.338 --> 02:51:28.860]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:32.383]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep
[02:51:32.563 --> 02:51:33.023]  I think so.
[02:52:05.672 --> 02:52:06.312]  It's here!
[02:52:06.312 --> 02:52:11.474]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:52:11.474 --> 02:52:19.796]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:52:19.796 --> 02:52:27.239]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:52:27.239 --> 02:52:34.081]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:52:34.628 --> 02:52:38.990]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:38.990 --> 02:52:42.932]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:42.932 --> 02:52:45.213]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:45.213 --> 02:52:49.655]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:52:49.655 --> 02:52:57.099]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:53:02.779 --> 02:53:07.061]  Thomas Jefferson once said, When the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:53:07.061 --> 02:53:10.343]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:53:10.343 --> 02:53:17.327]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[02:53:17.327 --> 02:53:23.010]  If we, the people, do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:53:23.010 --> 02:53:30.855]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter, sitting passively by.
[02:53:31.235 --> 02:53:35.998]  And accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:53:35.998 --> 02:53:38.599]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:53:38.599 --> 02:53:46.363]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[02:53:48.864 --> 02:53:52.806]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A, utopiasilver.com.
[02:53:52.806 --> 02:53:54.107]  Or call us today at 1-888-213-4338.
[02:53:54.107 --> 02:53:54.167]  1-888-213-4338.
[02:54:06.226 --> 02:54:13.830]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny has graciously agreed to stay with us 20 minutes in the next hour, so we're going to start going to your calls immediately when we start the fourth hour.
[02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:23.935]  The last 30 minutes, Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Jason Burmess, from the G20, openly announcing the end of the dollar in the next couple years, openly announcing global government.
[02:54:23.935 --> 02:54:27.457]  Just so much is happening, and they need this crisis of the flu.
[02:54:27.457 --> 02:54:30.779]  The UN bragged a couple months ago, this was great for world government.
[02:54:30.779 --> 02:54:33.040]  Everybody was following the World Health Organization orders.
[02:54:33.974 --> 02:54:42.467]  Is it immoral, if I tell people not to do anything illegal, but now they're making everything illegal, that people around the country are going to Walgreens in spring
[02:54:43.767 --> 02:54:49.248]  Uh, flu shot is poison, squalene mercury on the side of Walgreens.
[02:54:49.248 --> 02:54:57.870]  I don't think you should do that, but you probably should, you know, put up basic facts, hand out flyers, go to Sherry Tenpenny's website, hand those out to people.
[02:54:57.870 --> 02:55:12.874]  That's your First Amendment right, but if the flu shot causes Guillain-Barré's with anybody, if it causes neurological problems, if this has happened in the past, is it more immoral to not warn people and let them die or get sick, or is it
[02:55:14.375 --> 02:55:19.017]  More immoral to spray paint on the side of Walgreens, Dr. Sherry Tinpinning.
[02:55:19.017 --> 02:55:22.278]  Well, I don't know about immoral, but it certainly could be illegal.
[02:55:22.278 --> 02:55:24.519]  So, I think that there's other ways.
[02:55:24.519 --> 02:55:34.163]  I mean, I saw your report on that and I saw the letters that I saw which you wrote underneath there and I agree, you know, nobody's condoning people to go out and do vandalism and do that.
[02:55:34.163 --> 02:55:39.365]  But, you know, on the other hand, you know, good for them that they were brave enough to do it.
[02:55:39.935 --> 02:55:49.583]  Because I think that we've been so indoctrinated with fear for so long, fear from so many different areas, that we're afraid to stand up and say, and go hand out flyers.
[02:55:49.583 --> 02:56:06.235]  You know, I keep a, when I go to, if you go to PandemicFluOnline.com, or you go to DrTenPenny.com, and you download the flyers that says the truth about the flu shot, there's another one on PandemicFluOnline that's about the Raggedy Ann doll, and it tells you the whole history of what the mandatory vaccination is about.
[02:56:06.235 --> 02:56:07.997]  I keep a stack of those in the back of my car.
[02:56:08.982 --> 02:56:19.411]  And when I go into restaurants or I go into places like Macy's or Walmart or any place like that, I just take a handful of them and I just walk down the aisle and I just say, here's something you might want to look at.
[02:56:19.411 --> 02:56:21.032]  I don't engage in conversation.
[02:56:21.032 --> 02:56:24.915]  I don't want to debate and I don't really much care if they just throw them in the trash.
[02:56:24.915 --> 02:56:27.137]  But you never know where those might go.
[02:56:27.137 --> 02:56:29.639]  That person may take those and make 500 copies and hand
[02:56:31.601 --> 02:56:34.663]  I think what you're saying is resistance is victory.
[02:56:34.663 --> 02:56:41.166]  You have the truth, you resist, banner hangs on highways, posters, signs, city council.
[02:56:41.166 --> 02:56:42.567]  We are the people.
[02:56:42.567 --> 02:56:47.170]  If the listeners start, which they've done, that's why the show's so powerful, because of you, the listeners and viewers.
[02:56:47.170 --> 02:56:51.712]  If you go out and take action, spread links of this video, this audio to everybody you know.
[02:56:51.712 --> 02:56:54.273]  If you tell people about drtenpenny.com.
[02:56:54.273 --> 02:56:57.035]  If you just get involved, we're unstoppable.
[02:56:57.035 --> 02:56:58.356]  But if you sit there in fear,
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:56:59.980]  No, I didn't.
[02:57:17.012 --> 02:57:17.933]  I talked to the police.
[02:57:17.933 --> 02:57:21.417]  They were bragging about it.
[02:57:21.417 --> 02:57:25.702]  They called the rental car place off our license plate and said, you're trying to talk to the military.
[02:57:25.702 --> 02:57:26.763]  You're a terrorist.
[02:57:26.763 --> 02:57:30.147]  We're putting you on a list and I'm going to have to probably sue them.
[02:57:30.147 --> 02:57:32.069]  We just lost Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[02:57:32.069 --> 02:57:34.011]  We're going to call her back.
[02:57:34.011 --> 02:57:35.513]  Yeah, that phone system drops.
[02:57:35.513 --> 02:57:35.994]  We may have to.
[02:57:37.267 --> 02:57:40.228]  Go to a regular landline system.
[02:57:40.228 --> 02:57:42.048]  Or whatever happened.
[02:57:42.048 --> 02:57:44.209]  But we'll get her back on.
[02:57:44.209 --> 02:57:50.350]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:57:50.350 --> 02:57:51.351]  What these people do.
[02:57:51.351 --> 02:57:53.631]  And they're just totally immoral.
[02:57:53.631 --> 02:57:56.092]  They think of us as not even human.
[02:57:56.092 --> 02:57:59.513]  Frame somebody, lie about somebody, set somebody up.
[02:58:01.132 --> 02:58:03.113]  Saying my guys ran from the military.
[02:58:03.113 --> 02:58:04.614]  Total lies.
[02:58:04.614 --> 02:58:07.236]  I was on the cell phone when we went up to talk to the troops.
[02:58:07.236 --> 02:58:09.418]  Said, we want to talk to your public information officer.
[02:58:09.418 --> 02:58:11.279]  They said, ah, come back tomorrow.
[02:58:11.279 --> 02:58:13.500]  And then they call the police and say, guys, we're at the perimeter.
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:14.141]  They ran.
[02:58:14.141 --> 02:58:14.901]  They're terrorists.
[02:58:14.901 --> 02:58:16.662]  Get them.
[02:58:16.662 --> 02:58:19.144]  I mean, you know, this is the insanity.
[02:58:19.144 --> 02:58:21.225]  I'm surprised my guys are on the news in shackles.
[02:58:21.225 --> 02:58:22.066]  We caught al-Qaeda.
[02:58:22.066 --> 02:58:22.526]  We caught them.
[02:58:22.526 --> 02:58:22.986]  We caught them.
[02:58:22.986 --> 02:58:23.447]  We caught them.
[02:58:23.447 --> 02:58:26.389]  You know.
[02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:27.529]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, stay there.
[02:58:27.529 --> 02:58:28.410]  We're back in one minute.
[02:58:28.410 --> 02:58:29.311]  We're going to go to calls.
[02:58:30.353 --> 02:58:34.515]  And talk a lot more about this issue in the next 20 minutes with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.
[02:58:34.515 --> 02:58:36.737]  InfoWars.com is our website.
[02:58:36.737 --> 02:58:38.738]  DrTenpenny.com is hers.
[02:58:38.738 --> 02:58:43.160]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:45.782]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.782 --> 02:58:48.964]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.987 --> 02:58:54.369]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.369 --> 02:58:57.991]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.991 --> 02:59:02.553]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.553 --> 02:59:08.156]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.456 --> 02:59:13.220]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:16.842]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.842 --> 02:59:21.666]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.666 --> 02:59:28.230]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:30.172]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.652 --> 02:59:33.853]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.853 --> 02:59:38.355]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.355 --> 02:59:40.076]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:40.076 --> 02:59:40.516]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.516 --> 02:59:40.576]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.576 --> 02:59:41.137]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.137 --> 02:59:41.757]  Call today.
[02:59:41.757 --> 02:59:42.858]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.858 --> 02:59:44.058]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:05.046 --> 03:00:05.247]  Yeah.
[03:00:20.174 --> 03:00:24.315]  We're having trouble getting a hold of my crew in the middle of a demonstration in Pittsburgh, PA for G20.
[03:00:24.315 --> 03:00:26.415]  I hope they'll be here in 30 minutes.
[03:00:26.415 --> 03:00:27.255]  Stay with us for that.
[03:00:27.255 --> 03:00:30.776]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, are you ready to go to calls?
[03:00:30.776 --> 03:00:31.856]  I am.
[03:00:31.856 --> 03:00:33.897]  Let's talk to Aaron in Utah.
[03:00:33.897 --> 03:00:34.917]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[03:00:34.917 --> 03:00:35.337]  Go ahead.
[03:00:35.337 --> 03:00:38.678]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:38.678 --> 03:00:39.878]  Hello, sir.
[03:00:39.878 --> 03:00:40.718]  How are you?
[03:00:40.718 --> 03:00:41.018]  Good.
[03:00:41.018 --> 03:00:41.699]  What's on your mind?
[03:00:41.699 --> 03:00:42.299]  Good.
[03:00:42.299 --> 03:00:42.599]  Good.
[03:00:42.599 --> 03:00:44.519]  Hey, just a real quick question for you.
[03:00:44.519 --> 03:00:48.480]  I was listening to your show and another show, you know, RBN.
[03:00:49.076 --> 03:01:03.232]  With Dr. Chua, and he just released some information from Bob Chapman saying that the, uh, there's a naval vessel somewhere off the coast that's been fully quarantined now because the ship's captain and petty officer and many others have died from swine flu injections.
[03:01:04.821 --> 03:01:05.761]  Well, that's amazing.
[03:01:05.761 --> 03:01:06.802]  We'll check that.
[03:01:06.802 --> 03:01:10.763]  E-mail it to ridersandinfowars.com.
[03:01:10.763 --> 03:01:21.285]  But that's, you know, always with the 1918, 1976, 77, it always, the deadly thing only happens on a base, and then they try to force inoculation.
[03:01:21.285 --> 03:01:23.506]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, comments on that?
[03:01:23.506 --> 03:01:26.867]  Well, that would be pretty interesting to track that down to find out if that's true.
[03:01:26.867 --> 03:01:29.347]  But, you know, I think they're suspecting those things, Alex.
[03:01:29.347 --> 03:01:31.748]  I'm sure you reported a couple of days ago when the
[03:01:32.290 --> 03:01:40.919]  When the Canadian government sent swine flu vaccine and syringes in body bags to the Indians of northern Manitoba, the Indian reservations up there.
[03:01:40.919 --> 03:01:45.144]  So, was that the message that if you die from the flu, here's your body bags?
[03:01:45.144 --> 03:01:50.069]  Or was that the message, if you get your flu shot, you're going to die and here's your body bag?
[03:01:50.069 --> 03:01:53.153]  Yeah, that was in the National Post newspaper.
[03:01:54.474 --> 03:01:56.695]  Alex, thank you for your work and for having me on.
[03:01:56.695 --> 03:02:01.657]  I had some information from Professor Garth Nicholson that's written hundreds of peer-reviewed medical journal articles.
[03:02:23.991 --> 03:02:26.113]  Yes, he used to work at the MD Anderson facility.
[03:02:26.113 --> 03:02:26.713]  We've had him on.
[03:02:26.713 --> 03:02:30.156]  In fact, that's a good idea to get Nicholson on about the microplasm incognitus.
[03:02:30.156 --> 03:02:30.836]  Go ahead.
[03:02:30.836 --> 03:02:34.379]  Well, some of his videos I posted on my MySpace pages.
[03:02:34.379 --> 03:02:37.621]  MySpace.com slant toxic reverend.
[03:02:37.621 --> 03:02:39.523]  I'm an environmental technologist.
[03:02:39.523 --> 03:02:43.125]  But next to my icon, which is a red skull and bones, is a little link to his videos.
[03:02:43.125 --> 03:02:44.406]  You click on that, he has two.
[03:02:44.406 --> 03:02:47.929]  I posted two of his videos on the dangers of vaccines and another one
[03:02:48.399 --> 03:02:51.021]  On the biological weapons experiments on the American public.
[03:02:51.021 --> 03:02:52.842]  Yeah, he's a scientific medical doctor.
[03:02:52.842 --> 03:02:54.343]  Very prestigious.
[03:02:54.343 --> 03:02:54.903]  Right.
[03:02:54.903 --> 03:02:59.426]  And one of the things he talked about was how they don't screen for these mycoplasmas.
[03:02:59.426 --> 03:03:02.628]  They're now incapacitating agents, non-lethal bioweapons.
[03:03:02.628 --> 03:03:08.952]  Well, that's why all the studies in rats show vaccines are causing, in rodents, just incredible arthritis.
[03:03:08.952 --> 03:03:10.433]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:10.433 --> 03:03:17.578]  Dr. Tenpenny, can you comment on the RNA, the viruses, the German news reporting cancer viruses in the shots?
[03:03:18.635 --> 03:03:19.676]  Well, yes I can.
[03:03:19.676 --> 03:03:20.497]  And two points.
[03:03:20.497 --> 03:03:23.260]  One is just to acknowledge what the caller said.
[03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:32.709]  We've known for years that at least 6% of all vaccines, and these are also childhood vaccines, but up to 6% of vaccines have mycoplasma in them.
[03:03:32.709 --> 03:03:34.070]  They're not screened out for that.
[03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:37.513]  So that's not even the swine flu and the regular flu.
[03:03:37.513 --> 03:03:41.057]  So mycoplasma has been getting into the population for a long time.
[03:03:41.517 --> 03:03:43.699]  And describe people who don't know what that is.
[03:04:11.357 --> 03:04:11.579]  I think so.
[03:04:13.962 --> 03:04:15.403]  Just a big breaking news.
[03:04:15.403 --> 03:04:19.707]  I'm gonna get Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to post this right now, but you can just Google it.
[03:04:19.707 --> 03:04:22.729]  Navy ships under swine flu quarantine, AP.
[03:04:22.729 --> 03:04:27.693]  Group of Navy ships under quarantine after several dozen sailors and marines on board tested positive for swine flu.
[03:04:27.693 --> 03:04:29.774]  So they're just fear mongering over that.
[03:04:29.774 --> 03:04:31.716]  Doesn't look like anybody died.
[03:04:31.716 --> 03:04:35.239]  Health officials say at least 69 people have been confirmed with the virus.
[03:04:35.239 --> 03:04:40.323]  So they make much ado about nothing, when 37% of the population already has it and aren't even sick.
[03:04:40.323 --> 03:04:41.744]  And all of them have since recovered.
[03:04:42.444 --> 03:04:43.746]  So, nobody's dead.
[03:04:43.746 --> 03:04:44.767]  Key point there.
[03:04:44.767 --> 03:04:45.688]  Everyone get covered.
[03:04:45.688 --> 03:04:46.910]  There's the key point.
[03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:49.113]  Nobody's dead on the USS Boxer.
[03:04:49.113 --> 03:05:00.287]  Navy officials say they now quarantine an undetermined number of crew members with flu-like symptoms on four ships that are part of the USS Boxer Amphibious Ready Group, which arrived in Hawaii on Friday.
[03:05:00.287 --> 03:05:01.007]  The ships are docked
[03:05:01.650 --> 03:05:04.671]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.671 --> 03:05:09.992]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.992 --> 03:05:12.052]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.052 --> 03:05:17.053]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.053 --> 03:05:18.233]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.233 --> 03:05:19.353]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.353 --> 03:05:21.234]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.234 --> 03:05:22.314]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.314 --> 03:05:24.514]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.514 --> 03:05:25.855]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.855 --> 03:05:27.155]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.375 --> 03:05:32.642]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.642 --> 03:05:36.247]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.247 --> 03:05:40.052]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.052 --> 03:05:41.294]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.294 --> 03:05:42.195]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.195 --> 03:05:43.296]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.296 --> 03:05:44.238]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.238 --> 03:05:45.039]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.299 --> 03:05:48.343]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.343 --> 03:05:50.125]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.125 --> 03:05:51.046]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.649 --> 03:06:05.956]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.956 --> 03:06:10.482]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.482 --> 03:06:12.765]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.765 --> 03:06:14.387]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.387 --> 03:06:15.429]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.649 --> 03:06:24.073]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.073 --> 03:06:31.536]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:06:31.536 --> 03:06:37.579]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[03:06:37.579 --> 03:06:43.162]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:06:43.582 --> 03:06:47.725]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:06:47.725 --> 03:06:55.190]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now 866-762-9238.
[03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:58.493]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[03:07:01.977 --> 03:07:07.138]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[03:07:07.138 --> 03:07:10.639]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:07:10.639 --> 03:07:16.340]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:07:16.340 --> 03:07:18.900]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:07:18.900 --> 03:07:23.461]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.

[03:08:04.528 --> 03:08:07.308]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:07.308 --> 03:08:10.109]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.494 --> 03:08:14.696]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is breaking news.
[03:08:14.696 --> 03:08:18.898]  Do you know why my crew is not live with us right now?
[03:08:18.898 --> 03:08:20.439]  Why they were out of contact?
[03:08:20.439 --> 03:08:23.640]  They are under sustained LRAD sound cannon attack.
[03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:27.482]  You know they roll these out at tea parties in California and other places.
[03:08:27.482 --> 03:08:29.904]  First time I saw them was 2004 in New York.
[03:08:29.904 --> 03:08:37.788]  They have the National Guard engaging American citizens right now with deadly acoustic weapons that damage the middle ear.
[03:08:37.788 --> 03:08:37.908]  They
[03:08:38.959 --> 03:08:40.540]  Mike just talked to him.
[03:08:40.540 --> 03:08:42.581]  In fact, get Mike Nelson in here right now.
[03:08:42.581 --> 03:08:46.423]  And they go, we can't hear you, it's painful.
[03:08:46.423 --> 03:08:50.525]  And we're text messaging him, telling him just to call in right now.
[03:08:50.525 --> 03:08:53.207]  But it's blindingly loud.
[03:08:53.207 --> 03:08:54.368]  Get Mike in here right now.
[03:08:54.368 --> 03:08:55.768]  Mike heard it.
[03:08:55.768 --> 03:09:06.414]  This is happening right now in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while the G20 and mainstream news is getting rid of the dollar, bringing in world government against everybody right now.
[03:09:08.686 --> 03:09:14.829]  Mike Nelson just talked to Jason Douglas, and he's like, I can't hear you!
[03:09:14.829 --> 03:09:15.689]  I can't hear you!
[03:09:15.689 --> 03:09:18.630]  We're under sound weapon attack!
[03:09:18.630 --> 03:09:21.171]  Mike doesn't probably want to be on TV, but we'll just turn his mic on.
[03:09:21.171 --> 03:09:23.812]  Mike, you talked to him, you said you heard it.
[03:09:23.812 --> 03:09:25.933]  You're texting him now, telling him to call into the hotline.
[03:09:25.933 --> 03:09:27.534]  We're going to Sherry Tinpenny in a moment.
[03:09:27.534 --> 03:09:29.795]  Mike Nelson, office manager here at InfoWars.
[03:09:29.795 --> 03:09:31.755]  Tell folks what he told you.
[03:09:31.755 --> 03:09:37.798]  He said that they can't hear anything that I'm saying because they're under sound weapon
[03:09:38.294 --> 03:09:38.594]  I don't know.
[03:09:51.485 --> 03:09:53.226]  And then I hear a voice every so often.
[03:09:53.226 --> 03:09:55.647]  A voice saying, get back, get back.
[03:09:55.647 --> 03:09:57.848]  To leave the area.
[03:09:57.848 --> 03:09:58.829]  Holy mackerel!
[03:09:58.829 --> 03:10:00.369]  Put on CNN right now!
[03:10:00.369 --> 03:10:03.091]  I'll guarantee you this is going to be on the news.
[03:10:03.091 --> 03:10:10.274]  We've got reporters in the zone right now in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as the bastard bankers totally take everything over.
[03:10:10.274 --> 03:10:11.354]  Are they texting you back?
[03:10:11.354 --> 03:10:13.035]  I mean, we've got to get them on now!
[03:10:13.035 --> 03:10:13.996]  No one's texted me back.
[03:10:14.776 --> 03:10:15.757]  Man!
[03:10:15.757 --> 03:10:19.440]  We should have had the operating procedure that if they got hit with a sound weapon, immediately call in.
[03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:22.502]  Tell them in the text, get out of the area, and then call in.
[03:10:22.502 --> 03:10:23.643]  Ah!
[03:10:23.643 --> 03:10:26.605]  Well, no doubt they've got video of this incredible event.
[03:10:26.605 --> 03:10:31.669]  Oh man, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, I tell you, this brings new meaning to the word info war.
[03:10:31.669 --> 03:10:35.592]  Wow, Alex, that's pretty scary, isn't it?
[03:10:35.592 --> 03:10:40.176]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I mean, my life is like a Twilight Zone episode.
[03:10:40.176 --> 03:10:43.739]  Alex, do you know, have you heard reports from other parts of the world
[03:10:44.070 --> 03:10:51.325]  I mean, other than the U.S., are these sorts of things, these sound wave technologies, these mandatory vaccines, the FEMA camps, all this other stuff...
[03:10:52.659 --> 03:10:53.680]  Yes.
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:11:00.985]  Simultaneously, the Air Force said, well, we can't use this in Iraq in 2004 until we use it in America.
[03:11:00.985 --> 03:11:03.947]  So they started using it here, then saying it was no big deal.
[03:11:03.947 --> 03:11:06.449]  Now they're rolling out microwave guns.
[03:11:06.449 --> 03:11:13.955]  We've gotten confirmed reports, and I saw this in Denver, but it was in a police area, and when they saw me videoing it, they brought it in a garage.
[03:11:13.955 --> 03:11:16.156]  They have microwave guns.
[03:11:16.156 --> 03:11:17.717]  Big, big, mounted on Humvees.
[03:11:22.447 --> 03:11:28.309]  Listen, this is such a police state there that they tried to talk to the military and talk to a spokesman last night.
[03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:33.090]  Defense Link put a press release out and they said, no, we're not going to talk to you, get out of here.
[03:11:33.090 --> 03:11:40.333]  Then they got their license number, had the police pose as Alamo rental car people from the county there, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania.
[03:11:40.333 --> 03:11:40.993]  They called them.
[03:11:42.185 --> 03:11:44.466]  And said, oh, your car's got no brakes.
[03:11:44.466 --> 03:11:45.546]  Bring it in.
[03:11:45.546 --> 03:11:47.106]  And they said, well, we're in the coordinate G20.
[03:11:47.106 --> 03:11:48.807]  We're news reporters.
[03:11:48.807 --> 03:11:50.567]  We can't get out till tomorrow.
[03:11:50.567 --> 03:11:56.969]  And they said, well, that's fine, because I'm a police officer with the Army and FBI, and you've all been put on terror list, and your life's over, boy.
[03:11:56.969 --> 03:12:00.750]  And we know you're a terrorist, and you were sneaking around the military base and ran.
[03:12:00.750 --> 03:12:02.470]  All lies, Sherry.
[03:12:02.470 --> 03:12:04.791]  Just, I mean, and they just think of us as dirt.
[03:12:06.704 --> 03:12:11.469]  Well, and here's the thing, Alex, is that you say, they just think of us.
[03:12:11.469 --> 03:12:13.391]  They are our neighbors.
[03:12:13.391 --> 03:12:16.174]  They are people who live in our communities.
[03:12:16.174 --> 03:12:19.057]  Their job is working for the other side.
[03:12:19.057 --> 03:12:22.961]  We have to get through to these people that, wait a minute, I'm your friend.
[03:12:22.961 --> 03:12:24.062]  I'm your neighbor.
[03:12:24.062 --> 03:12:24.903]  I'm an American.
[03:12:24.903 --> 03:12:28.327]  I vote for presidents and people just like you do.
[03:12:28.327 --> 03:12:29.268]  Why are you doing this?
[03:12:30.433 --> 03:12:32.033]  I mean, there has to be a way.
[03:12:32.033 --> 03:12:44.195]  We have to learn from history that, you know, when Nazi people, when Germans started assaulting fellow Germans, I mean, all the Jews that they dragged away were all Germans, and that they hurt other Germans.
[03:12:44.195 --> 03:12:47.256]  I mean, we've got to let people get through to them.
[03:12:47.256 --> 03:12:49.376]  Stand there and say, wait a minute, you're in America.
[03:12:49.376 --> 03:12:51.117]  Why are you doing this?
[03:12:51.117 --> 03:12:59.118]  And I think that passive resistance, handing out flyers and trying to, when you're standing there in the gap, if it comes to that, to remember that, to remind these people that
[03:12:59.542 --> 03:13:02.164]  Hey, we're on the same team.
[03:13:02.164 --> 03:13:07.687]  It should be us against the people that are telling you what to do, not you against me.
[03:13:07.687 --> 03:13:09.348]  We should be doing this differently.
[03:13:09.348 --> 03:13:11.169]  Why are you doing this?
[03:13:11.169 --> 03:13:15.472]  And I think that we have got to start using those passive resistance tools.
[03:13:15.472 --> 03:13:23.597]  We have to use all the mind games that they try to play on us and turn the tables around and get people to understand that we're all Americans.
[03:13:24.127 --> 03:13:31.191]  And that who's ever giving those orders against Americans, that's the enemy, not the person standing in front of you.
[03:13:31.191 --> 03:13:43.298]  And somehow, I don't have all the answers, Alex, and I know you don't either, but we've got to come up with some solutions for people who may be standing in the gap of what can they do in that moment in terms of resistance other than violence.
[03:13:43.298 --> 03:13:44.058]  What else can they do?
[03:13:44.977 --> 03:13:45.977]  Well, I want to say this.
[03:13:45.977 --> 03:13:50.959]  Approximately eight minutes ago, we got on the phone with Douglas and he said, I can hear nothing.
[03:13:50.959 --> 03:13:52.099]  They're using sound weapons.
[03:13:52.099 --> 03:13:53.179]  They're telling us to disperse.
[03:13:53.179 --> 03:13:58.841]  Mike Nelson heard the wah and then troops stopping every 30 seconds, you know, saying disperse, disperse.
[03:13:58.841 --> 03:13:59.541]  We've got them.
[03:13:59.541 --> 03:14:00.581]  Let's go to live now.
[03:14:00.581 --> 03:14:02.022]  Here they are from Pittsburgh.
[03:14:02.022 --> 03:14:04.442]  G20 under attack.
[03:14:04.442 --> 03:14:07.623]  Wait, Mike just said they had them.
[03:14:07.623 --> 03:14:09.063]  Put them on the system.
[03:14:09.063 --> 03:14:10.504]  That's why we punch them up.
[03:14:11.172 --> 03:14:12.113]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[03:14:12.113 --> 03:14:12.753]  Yes, yes.
[03:14:12.753 --> 03:14:14.054]  Is this Rob Duda?
[03:14:14.054 --> 03:14:19.658]  Yeah, we're on 33rd and Liberty in kind of a downtown part of Pittsburgh.
[03:14:19.658 --> 03:14:24.602]  We just passed a, they had a block, a tree blocked off and they were using a sonic weapon on us.
[03:14:24.602 --> 03:14:31.747]  They were using it to broadcast and then they would ramp up the signal for a brief second to let them know that they could, you know, blow some eardrums out.
[03:14:31.747 --> 03:14:33.288]  It got pretty loud.
[03:14:33.288 --> 03:14:36.631]  And people were crouching down behind... Who were they using this on?
[03:14:36.631 --> 03:14:38.252]  Was this on a protest or just you?
[03:14:39.039 --> 03:14:39.940]  No, this is a protest.
[03:14:39.940 --> 03:14:40.902]  This is a protest.
[03:14:40.902 --> 03:14:51.937]  We were walking with the protesters downtown and, um... Tell me you've got video of this, the first time US military uses weapons on the US since, like, Kent State.
[03:14:51.937 --> 03:14:55.042]  You're telling me you guys had camera rolling under attack?
[03:14:55.663 --> 03:14:58.064]  We had camera rolling while the sonic weapons were going off.
[03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:16.610]  It's pretty wild.
[03:15:16.610 --> 03:15:17.471]  It's pretty wild right now.
[03:15:17.471 --> 03:15:19.191]  It seems like everybody dispersed, though.
[03:15:19.191 --> 03:15:23.113]  And after it happened, one group, the largest group, went through an alleyway.
[03:15:23.113 --> 03:15:28.896]  Well, why don't you go back and film the troops with pleasure up there with their gun?
[03:15:28.896 --> 03:15:29.776]  Okay.
[03:15:29.776 --> 03:15:30.757]  Now, listen, do whatever you want.
[03:15:30.757 --> 03:15:31.857]  It's a meeting.
[03:15:31.857 --> 03:15:33.538]  They're driving right past me right now.
[03:15:33.538 --> 03:15:34.598]  Get them on tape.
[03:15:34.598 --> 03:15:36.819]  With the gun.
[03:15:36.819 --> 03:15:37.660]  There are two of them.
[03:15:37.660 --> 03:15:41.301]  They're using them to broadcast messages in Spanish and English.
[03:15:41.301 --> 03:15:42.902]  That's the engine right now.
[03:15:42.902 --> 03:15:43.882]  You can hear it passing me.
[03:15:43.882 --> 03:15:45.143]  And there's a guy sitting on top.
[03:15:45.931 --> 03:15:54.193]  And they would broadcast the message from the chief of police that we were in an unlawful march and they said don't arrest anybody, doesn't matter if you're press or not.
[03:15:54.193 --> 03:15:58.473]  They didn't disperse and then they started launching the weapon.
[03:15:58.473 --> 03:16:02.954]  So, people don't have a permitted march, violating the First Amendment, you don't need to have a permit.
[03:16:02.954 --> 03:16:07.215]  What was the march doing when you were attacked and was it National Guard or police?
[03:16:07.215 --> 03:16:08.355]  It was police.
[03:16:08.355 --> 03:16:10.656]  Everybody has police on their chest.
[03:16:10.656 --> 03:16:11.696]  I haven't seen, I do see
[03:16:13.651 --> 03:16:17.472]  There weren't dark outfits, you know, the Darth Vader looking outfits, and then they have the camo.
[03:16:17.472 --> 03:16:24.975]  But the news is reporting, and you guys say you talked to National Guard this morning, you were saying they're together, and the National Guard are in like a police uniform.
[03:16:24.975 --> 03:16:31.697]  The National Guard was not armed at all in terms of with billy clubs or anything, but they were working with police to cordon off areas.
[03:16:31.697 --> 03:16:32.977]  And they had Humvees.
[03:16:32.977 --> 03:16:35.058]  Right now I'm looking at a line of police
[03:16:36.245 --> 03:16:38.667]  Stretched on there in full riot gear too.
[03:16:38.667 --> 03:16:40.768]  The police I'm seeing now are in full riot gear.
[03:16:40.768 --> 03:16:44.210]  Are they the police though wearing the National Guard bottoms?
[03:16:44.210 --> 03:16:44.630]  No.
[03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:49.373]  No, they're all wearing dark although there are some, they look like border patrol.
[03:16:49.373 --> 03:16:51.154]  I've seen border patrol here too.
[03:16:51.154 --> 03:16:54.116]  They have the dark green border patrol uniforms.
[03:16:54.116 --> 03:16:58.198]  So federal police in the middle of Pennsylvania.
[03:16:58.198 --> 03:17:01.340]  Again, and Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, I'm going to come back to you in the next segment, okay?
[03:17:02.222 --> 03:17:04.523]  Okay, we'll put you on hold for five minutes.
[03:17:04.523 --> 03:17:05.583]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[03:17:05.583 --> 03:17:09.084]  Give me a complete report of what happened to you.
[03:17:09.084 --> 03:17:27.590]  Okay, we were walking down Liberty Street, and right as we were getting to 34th, they had the street blocked off, and they were talking to us through the little sound can and things, and then they would press them, you know, just to do a beep, and we'd be like, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, but it would get really loud for a split second, and then they would turn it down, and then bring it back up again, and then turn it down, just to let you know that they could do that.
[03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:31.031]  You know, it was definitely a show of force, and there's probably
[03:17:31.664 --> 03:17:34.367]  I'm looking at about 300 military right now.
[03:17:34.367 --> 03:17:35.969]  And Douglas said it was painful.
[03:17:35.969 --> 03:17:36.589]  Was it painful?
[03:17:40.855 --> 03:17:42.035]  Um, it got loud.
[03:17:42.035 --> 03:17:44.056]  It didn't get loud to where it was painful, but it got loud.
[03:17:44.056 --> 03:17:45.576]  And you know they could turn it up louder.
[03:17:45.576 --> 03:17:53.399]  They were throwing it up at us just to let us know, and people started crouching down behind cars and mailboxes because they thought they were going to do the real thing on us.
[03:17:53.399 --> 03:17:53.919]  What were they?
[03:17:53.919 --> 03:17:55.979]  I think they did do the real thing on you, buddy.
[03:17:55.979 --> 03:17:59.740]  That's what Douglas said, but do always as a cheerful person.
[03:17:59.740 --> 03:18:02.241]  Uh, do, uh, whatever.
[03:18:02.241 --> 03:18:08.303]  The point is, uh, Rob, specifically, what were they broadcasting in English?
[03:18:09.449 --> 03:18:10.869]  I have that on tape.
[03:18:10.869 --> 03:18:15.611]  Basically what they're saying is that we're in an unlawful assembly and that you police are to disperse.
[03:18:15.611 --> 03:18:20.632]  If we don't disperse, you'll be arrested and they may use non-lethal means.
[03:18:20.632 --> 03:18:22.832]  Non-lethal means?
[03:18:22.832 --> 03:18:25.313]  Could be.
[03:18:25.313 --> 03:18:28.954]  Could be injured, you know, non-lethal means.
[03:18:28.954 --> 03:18:32.514]  Is Burmese or do... Is Burmese... Burmese is right next to me.
[03:18:32.514 --> 03:18:33.335]  Let me talk to him.
[03:18:34.935 --> 03:18:41.662]  Hey, I want to be clear about this.
[03:18:41.662 --> 03:18:43.144]  They were shooting you guys with this.
[03:18:43.144 --> 03:18:44.946]  Douglas was saying it was hurting.
[03:18:44.946 --> 03:18:45.687]  What was this like?
[03:18:46.715 --> 03:18:48.796]  The decibel level was very, very high.
[03:18:48.796 --> 03:18:50.857]  One moment, I was covering in front of a protest.
[03:18:50.857 --> 03:18:53.739]  The next moment, my eardrums were blasting.
[03:18:53.739 --> 03:19:02.023]  And as that happened, I basically turned around, saw about 40 riot police assisted by military, and I ran up and I got all the footage I could.
[03:19:02.023 --> 03:19:03.704]  Every once in a while, I'd have to take a few steps back.
[03:19:03.704 --> 03:19:04.024]  There you go.
[03:19:04.024 --> 03:19:05.004]  Assisted by military.
[03:19:05.004 --> 03:19:08.046]  So this is the military attacking the American people.
[03:19:08.046 --> 03:19:10.647]  Because in every news article I see, they're together.
[03:19:10.647 --> 03:19:12.888]  So that's key for the article Watson's doing.
[03:19:12.888 --> 03:19:14.109]  The military was with them.
[03:19:14.830 --> 03:19:15.510]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:17.872]  I mean, they were in military fatigue.
[03:19:17.872 --> 03:19:19.933]  SWAT is also here.
[03:19:19.933 --> 03:19:29.978]  I got a good shot of one of the military personnel who was at the top of the sound decibel thing on top of the Pittsburgh paddy wagon.
[03:19:29.978 --> 03:19:31.839]  There's no doubt that there's military here, Alex.
[03:19:31.839 --> 03:19:40.144]  Earlier today, me and Rob Dew filmed a convoy of about seven to eight trucks and vans with National Guard logos on them.
[03:19:40.144 --> 03:19:42.225]  I approached some military earlier today.
[03:19:42.765 --> 03:19:43.806]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:19:43.806 --> 03:19:46.107]  We're coming back to you in just a moment.
[03:19:46.107 --> 03:19:49.289]  And Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, I want to talk to Bermas when we get back.
[03:19:49.289 --> 03:19:49.509]  Stay there.
[03:19:49.509 --> 03:19:50.690]  I'm going to talk to you during the break, Bermas.
[03:20:02.927 --> 03:20:04.728]  Life Change Tea sets the standard.
[03:20:04.728 --> 03:20:11.832]  Have you heard on radio all the new teas with funny names, movie stars, celebrities endorsing these products and so on?
[03:20:11.832 --> 03:20:13.452]  Have you checked the results?
[03:20:13.452 --> 03:20:16.814]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[03:20:16.814 --> 03:20:22.157]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[03:20:22.157 --> 03:20:23.378]  Have you checked their results?
[03:20:23.378 --> 03:20:24.438]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[03:20:24.438 --> 03:20:26.899]  Did you check the ingredients and did you check for caffeine?
[03:20:26.899 --> 03:20:27.420]  Yeah!
[03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:30.141]  Life Change Tea is the real deal.
[03:20:30.141 --> 03:20:35.065]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[03:20:35.065 --> 03:20:36.506]  And it will clean your body.
[03:20:36.506 --> 03:20:37.847]  Our middle name is Results.
[03:20:37.847 --> 03:20:40.208]  You can pay more and you can have a celebrity smile.
[03:20:40.208 --> 03:20:41.309]  Or you can get results.
[03:20:41.309 --> 03:20:41.889]  Your call.
[03:20:41.889 --> 03:20:44.131]  Or should I say, make the call.
[03:20:44.131 --> 03:20:44.751]  Get the tea at 928-308-0408.
[03:20:44.751 --> 03:20:45.131]  That's 928-308-0408.
[03:20:45.131 --> 03:20:47.193]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[03:20:47.193 --> 03:20:48.093]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[03:21:01.483 --> 03:21:05.566]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:21:05.566 --> 03:21:11.471]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:21:11.471 --> 03:21:17.276]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:21:17.276 --> 03:21:21.079]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984,
[03:21:23.041 --> 03:21:31.066]  And the Trading With The Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings, are subject to government intervention.
[03:21:31.066 --> 03:21:36.670]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:21:36.670 --> 03:21:43.335]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:21:43.335 --> 03:21:44.696]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:44.696 --> 03:21:46.257]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:21:49.779 --> 03:21:50.840]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:50.840 --> 03:21:55.984]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:21:55.984 --> 03:21:56.404]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:56.404 --> 03:21:59.066]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:21:59.066 --> 03:22:05.431]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:22:05.431 --> 03:22:08.093]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:22:08.093 --> 03:22:09.254]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:22:09.254 --> 03:22:10.976]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:22:10.976 --> 03:22:13.858]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:22:13.858 --> 03:22:17.881]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:22:17.881 --> 03:22:18.742]  Do you listen?
[03:22:27.144 --> 03:22:32.017]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:22:35.814 --> 03:22:37.275]  How dare you?
[03:22:37.275 --> 03:22:43.317]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:22:43.317 --> 03:22:45.778]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:22:45.778 --> 03:22:52.661]  And if the government has not told the truth, in 5 years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:14.876]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:23:27.143 --> 03:23:32.345]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Peirce soap products.

[03:23:59.419 --> 03:24:00.659]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:00.659 --> 03:24:02.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just went live cutting out a break.
[03:24:02.720 --> 03:24:03.601]  Go back to Jason.
[03:24:03.601 --> 03:24:05.842]  Listen to this.
[03:24:05.842 --> 03:24:06.402]  Go back to him.
[03:24:06.402 --> 03:24:09.864]  We just had the sirens.
[03:24:09.864 --> 03:24:10.585]  Jason, are you there?
[03:24:12.520 --> 03:24:13.381]  What on earth just happened?
[03:24:13.381 --> 03:24:16.384]  It was total bedlam, riot police, tear gas masks.
[03:24:16.384 --> 03:24:22.410]  They were closing in on... Jason!
[03:24:22.410 --> 03:24:23.491]  Where on earth did he just go?
[03:24:23.491 --> 03:24:27.394]  We just heard blaring sirens and riot police coming at him.
[03:24:27.394 --> 03:24:29.096]  Cherry Tenpenny, you were on hold.
[03:24:29.096 --> 03:24:30.017]  You heard all that.
[03:24:30.017 --> 03:24:31.599]  Did you hear that total bedlam?
[03:24:31.599 --> 03:24:32.680]  I did.
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:33.420]  They're closing in.
[03:24:34.352 --> 03:24:35.352]  Text message them all!
[03:24:35.352 --> 03:24:35.953]  Get out of there!
[03:24:35.953 --> 03:24:37.573]  They're going to arrest everybody!
[03:24:37.573 --> 03:24:38.494]  Get out of there!
[03:24:38.494 --> 03:24:39.174]  Send the message!
[03:24:39.174 --> 03:24:40.214]  Evacuate immediately!
[03:24:40.214 --> 03:24:41.315]  Get out of there with the video!
[03:24:41.315 --> 03:24:42.695]  Get out of there right now!
[03:24:42.695 --> 03:24:44.456]  This has happened to me in New York and other places!
[03:24:44.456 --> 03:24:45.276]  Get out!
[03:24:45.276 --> 03:24:46.697]  I told Burmas to get out!
[03:24:46.697 --> 03:24:51.459]  Burmas, are you there?
[03:24:51.459 --> 03:24:51.879]  Jason!
[03:24:58.584 --> 03:25:10.532]  Okay, hang up, and let's try one more time to talk to him, and then let's... Jason, are you there?
[03:25:10.532 --> 03:25:14.055]  Put his phone live on air, to see if it's still live.
[03:25:14.055 --> 03:25:18.278]  No, there's no way, it was... Dr. Tenpenny, what did you hear right before his phone went dead as we went live?
[03:25:20.307 --> 03:25:24.790]  I heard him say that everybody had their gas masks on and they were asking everybody to leave the area.
[03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:27.811]  It sounded like they were going to start using gas there.
[03:25:27.811 --> 03:25:34.335]  And the police, he said, the last thing, were coming from three ways, blocking them in.
[03:25:34.335 --> 03:25:35.075]  That's what they do.
[03:25:35.075 --> 03:25:39.258]  They corner you and then attack.
[03:25:39.258 --> 03:25:40.979]  Is that Burmese's phone?
[03:25:40.979 --> 03:25:44.301]  It's still connected?
[03:25:44.301 --> 03:25:45.941]  He must have jumped into a business or something.
[03:25:45.941 --> 03:25:46.402]  That's smart.
[03:25:47.293 --> 03:25:52.459]  Okay, call Douglas, call their... call Douglas' phone.
[03:25:52.459 --> 03:25:54.361]  Don't bother, I'm talking to Alex.
[03:25:54.361 --> 03:25:56.503]  If you want to call me, you have to call me on my cell phone.
[03:25:56.503 --> 03:26:00.207]  Marmus, I can hear you!
[03:26:00.207 --> 03:26:00.607]  Marmus!
[03:26:00.607 --> 03:26:02.029]  Alright, thanks man.
[03:26:02.029 --> 03:26:02.630]  Bye.
[03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:03.851]  Marmus!
[03:26:03.851 --> 03:26:04.532]  Marmus, we're here!
[03:26:14.170 --> 03:26:16.192]  Okay, the DoPhone went dead, but it's not dead.
[03:26:16.192 --> 03:26:17.914]  We're on it right now.
[03:26:17.914 --> 03:26:20.076]  Tell him to talk to us.
[03:26:20.076 --> 03:26:26.003]  I'm doing well, man.
[03:26:26.003 --> 03:26:27.004]  Good.
[03:26:27.004 --> 03:26:28.065]  They don't know that they're on air.
[03:26:34.867 --> 03:26:35.987]  We're transferring them right now.
[03:26:35.987 --> 03:26:37.888]  We'll keep this phone live in case we lose them.
[03:26:37.888 --> 03:26:39.188]  Dr. Tempeni, I apologize.
[03:26:39.188 --> 03:26:40.969]  This is all happening the day you're on with us.
[03:26:40.969 --> 03:26:42.390]  Oh, that's fine, Alex.
[03:26:42.390 --> 03:26:44.350]  I mean, breaking news is breaking news.
[03:26:44.350 --> 03:26:45.330]  What do you think of this?
[03:26:45.330 --> 03:26:53.533]  I think it's really... I think it's really scary.
[03:26:53.533 --> 03:26:55.354]  I'm in, Alex, if you need me.
[03:26:55.354 --> 03:26:57.434]  Okay, Burmins, your phone was still connected.
[03:26:57.434 --> 03:26:58.915]  You just couldn't hear audio from us.
[03:27:00.311 --> 03:27:02.512]  Well, I tried, the battery went dead on dues.
[03:27:02.512 --> 03:27:06.495]  I tried to make a call back, you hand me his phone, and by the time that you stopped talking, it had just turned off.
[03:27:06.495 --> 03:27:06.955]  No, that's fine.
[03:27:06.955 --> 03:27:12.578]  You said they were coming down the streets from three ways, and there was blaring sirens, and then it went dead.
[03:27:12.578 --> 03:27:13.919]  What happened?
[03:27:13.919 --> 03:27:16.360]  That was a convoy of police officers.
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:17.201]  I started to film them.
[03:27:17.201 --> 03:27:18.281]  They went down to one street.
[03:27:18.281 --> 03:27:19.002]  They're now gone.
[03:27:19.002 --> 03:27:24.385]  We still have, it looks like four or five streets filled up with police officers.
[03:27:24.385 --> 03:27:25.365]  Let me explain.
[03:27:25.365 --> 03:27:26.726]  Listen to me carefully.
[03:27:26.726 --> 03:27:28.227]  Do you have Dewin Douglas with you?
[03:27:28.936 --> 03:27:32.238]  No, they've already gone down about three blocks.
[03:27:32.238 --> 03:27:32.719]  Leave!
[03:27:32.719 --> 03:27:35.481]  I want you to leave until I get in contact with them.
[03:27:35.481 --> 03:27:36.962]  Get out of there with the video.
[03:27:36.962 --> 03:27:40.024]  They will take our cameras, take the video, and then break them.
[03:27:40.024 --> 03:27:41.285]  They always give them back broken.
[03:27:41.285 --> 03:27:42.446]  It's happened to me twice.
[03:27:42.446 --> 03:27:43.806]  Get out of there.
[03:27:43.806 --> 03:27:50.671]  I want you to get out of the area at least five blocks away and duck in to get a cup of coffee or something, acting normal.
[03:27:50.671 --> 03:27:53.353]  They've trained locals to spy on people and tattle.
[03:27:53.353 --> 03:27:57.216]  This has happened to me in Brooksville, in California, in Florida, and other places.
[03:27:57.216 --> 03:27:58.397]  So just nonchalantly,
[03:27:58.897 --> 03:28:03.802]  Go in, get a cup of coffee and wait somewhere or a sub shop or something.
[03:28:03.802 --> 03:28:05.463]  Get out of there.
[03:28:05.463 --> 03:28:08.226]  Go in a restaurant, order a beer, whatever you gotta do.
[03:28:08.226 --> 03:28:09.747]  Just go into a bar.
[03:28:09.747 --> 03:28:13.911]  Go sit down somewhere because they are going to lock down.
[03:28:13.911 --> 03:28:16.654]  You were saying that you saw them at the ends of all the streets, correct?
[03:28:17.290 --> 03:28:20.171]  Oh, they're all around me on each side, in the middle of the street.
[03:28:20.171 --> 03:28:21.331]  I am surrounded by people.
[03:28:21.331 --> 03:28:24.292]  Listen, listen, I'm going to keep you on hold on this line.
[03:28:24.292 --> 03:28:27.072]  We'll keep coming back to you to make sure you get out of there.
[03:28:27.072 --> 03:28:31.613]  So if they attack you or rubber bullet you, it'll all happen on record.
[03:28:31.613 --> 03:28:32.513]  They're criminal activities.
[03:28:32.513 --> 03:28:33.474]  But do you hear me?
[03:28:33.474 --> 03:28:35.174]  Don't act suspicious.
[03:28:35.174 --> 03:28:36.154]  Don't act suspicious.
[03:28:36.154 --> 03:28:38.035]  Act like a mindless mainline reporter.
[03:28:38.035 --> 03:28:39.855]  Get the hell out of there now.
[03:28:39.855 --> 03:28:41.195]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:28:41.195 --> 03:28:43.616]  We're going to monitor your situation from here.
[03:28:43.616 --> 03:28:44.196]  I'm going to call...
[03:28:44.857 --> 03:28:50.191]  Uh, you're saying your phone's working, uh, Dougla- uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Dues is bad or is Douglas's?
[03:28:50.191 --> 03:28:51.093]  Who should we call now?
[03:28:51.093 --> 03:28:52.698]  Dues's battery is now dead!
[03:28:53.655 --> 03:28:59.316]  Okay, so we got a text message, Jason Douglas, to get the hell out of there now.
[03:28:59.316 --> 03:29:03.037]  They are going to arrest them, guaranteed.
[03:29:03.037 --> 03:29:06.437]  I have been in the middle of this over and over again at the RNC, you name it.
[03:29:06.437 --> 03:29:07.837]  Get out of there.
[03:29:07.837 --> 03:29:09.658]  Get out of there now.
[03:29:09.658 --> 03:29:09.958]  Okay?
[03:29:09.958 --> 03:29:11.538]  I'm getting out of there.
[03:29:11.538 --> 03:29:11.938]  Yes, sir.
[03:29:11.938 --> 03:29:13.658]  Don't disconnect the phone.
[03:29:13.658 --> 03:29:16.399]  Just keep it with you, and get out of there.
[03:29:16.399 --> 03:29:16.919]  Go!
[03:29:16.919 --> 03:29:18.179]  Alright.
[03:29:18.179 --> 03:29:20.260]  Listen, Burmese, don't go towards the big street with cops.
[03:29:20.260 --> 03:29:22.100]  Go down an alley or a side road, okay?
[03:29:24.002 --> 03:29:25.184]  All right, good, good.
[03:29:25.184 --> 03:29:25.825]  All right, good.
[03:29:25.825 --> 03:29:27.989]  We got that problem handled.
[03:29:27.989 --> 03:29:30.193]  The other two guys, though, are going down towards the police.
[03:29:30.193 --> 03:29:32.237]  Lord knows what'll happen to them.
[03:29:32.237 --> 03:29:34.161]  I don't want my guys being through this anymore.
[03:29:36.067 --> 03:29:39.050]  Because once I heard they were blocking off streets, that means they're going in on them.
[03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:40.531]  They don't care if people disperse.
[03:29:40.531 --> 03:29:43.995]  It's about drawing blood, first blood on the American people.
[03:29:43.995 --> 03:29:45.016]  It's about attacking us.
[03:29:45.016 --> 03:29:50.121]  These audio and microwave weapons are about training the police to open fire.
[03:29:50.121 --> 03:29:51.702]  It's a simulation weapon.
[03:29:51.702 --> 03:29:53.084]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.084 --> 03:29:55.606]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.606 --> 03:29:58.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.254 --> 03:30:05.496]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.496 --> 03:30:07.496]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.496 --> 03:30:16.019]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.019 --> 03:30:21.582]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.582 --> 03:30:23.442]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.442 --> 03:30:29.945]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.945 --> 03:30:30.705]  The Ecola Blue...
[03:30:36.051 --> 03:30:38.553]  I'm getting a shot of it.
[03:30:38.553 --> 03:30:44.239]  I would assume it sounds like the sound weapon is about maybe a block away to my right.
[03:30:44.239 --> 03:30:45.620]  Okay, I want you to... Oh my god.
[03:31:01.758 --> 03:31:06.441]  Can you get around on the street but not with the protesters and get a shot as you leave?
[03:31:06.441 --> 03:31:08.843]  Yes sir, that's exactly what I'm doing.
[03:31:08.843 --> 03:31:13.266]  I'm going around to cut them off at the front and hopefully being able to get them.
[03:31:13.266 --> 03:31:15.347]  Coming around and seeing where the troops are.
[03:31:15.347 --> 03:31:18.369]  I've got a firefighter shooting up right next to me.
[03:31:18.369 --> 03:31:22.051]  However, I've made it past the majority of the police officers.
[03:31:22.051 --> 03:31:24.433]  So the riot police are probably now
[03:31:26.127 --> 03:31:29.729]  Yeah, stay outside the cordon, but then, this is up to you.
[03:31:29.729 --> 03:31:34.011]  Well, I don't want to lose the video you've got, because they'll just deny any of this ever even happened.
[03:31:34.011 --> 03:31:36.772]  We looked at CNN, Fox, this is nowhere.
[03:31:36.772 --> 03:31:38.413]  This is nowhere.
[03:31:38.413 --> 03:31:41.455]  We know in New York in 2004 they used it.
[03:31:41.455 --> 03:31:47.378]  We heard it from a distance by the time we got there, everybody was fleeing.
[03:31:47.378 --> 03:31:53.081]  We heard the sound weapon, is it off now?
[03:31:53.081 --> 03:31:53.381]  Burmas?
[03:31:56.124 --> 03:31:58.865]  Jason!
[03:31:58.865 --> 03:31:59.786]  Is the phone disconnected?
[03:31:59.786 --> 03:32:06.209]  I went dead.
[03:32:06.209 --> 03:32:07.290]  It's on, do you hear it?
[03:32:07.290 --> 03:32:09.491]  Burmas, hold the phone up so we can hear the yellow rad.
[03:32:09.491 --> 03:32:11.852]  Hey, yeah, no, it went dead for a second, Alex.
[03:32:11.852 --> 03:32:13.953]  I still was connected to you, but it went dead for a moment.
[03:32:13.953 --> 03:32:15.134]  Hold on.
[03:32:15.134 --> 03:32:16.215]  I'll hold the phone up.
[03:32:16.215 --> 03:32:18.136]  It looks like they've gone a block away.
[03:32:18.136 --> 03:32:18.796]  Let's see if you can hear it.
[03:32:22.216 --> 03:32:24.878]  See, I've got other trucks now coming past me.
[03:32:24.878 --> 03:32:27.780]  It looks like they've also got a couple of empty buses.
[03:32:27.780 --> 03:32:30.362]  And right now, approaching me are the protesters.
[03:32:30.362 --> 03:32:32.784]  Here come the protesters, Alex.
[03:32:32.784 --> 03:32:33.444]  Towards you?
[03:32:33.444 --> 03:32:35.506]  Towards me right now!
[03:32:35.506 --> 03:32:36.586]  Get away from them!
[03:32:36.586 --> 03:32:37.067]  Get away!
[03:32:37.067 --> 03:32:37.727]  Stay way ahead!
[03:32:37.727 --> 03:32:38.988]  You're gonna get caught up with them!
[03:32:38.988 --> 03:32:40.509]  Look, stop getting video.
[03:32:40.509 --> 03:32:41.630]  I'm making the decision.
[03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:42.791]  Get the hell out of there right now!
[03:32:43.626 --> 03:32:44.106]  Okay, okay.
[03:32:44.106 --> 03:32:44.526]  Go!
[03:32:44.526 --> 03:32:44.827]  Go!
[03:32:44.827 --> 03:32:47.048]  Stop filming and get out of there if they're coming towards you.
[03:32:47.048 --> 03:32:48.448]  They're going to drive you down.
[03:32:48.448 --> 03:32:49.809]  You cannot get caught.
[03:32:49.809 --> 03:32:50.989]  Get out of there.
[03:32:50.989 --> 03:32:51.110]  Okay.
[03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.550]  Alright, alright.
[03:32:51.550 --> 03:32:52.270]  I'll move it.
[03:32:52.270 --> 03:32:54.331]  I mean, they've taken AP reporters' recordings.
[03:32:54.331 --> 03:32:58.353]  They've taken Pacifica reporters and arrested them and smashed their cameras.
[03:32:58.353 --> 03:32:59.614]  They will take your stuff.
[03:32:59.614 --> 03:33:01.234]  They will break the cameras.
[03:33:01.234 --> 03:33:03.716]  They are complete enemies of America.
[03:33:03.716 --> 03:33:04.636]  They love it.
[03:33:04.636 --> 03:33:12.400]  And folks, if you don't think the military won't come after your guns, if you don't think the military doesn't want to disarm you, if you don't think they aren't spoiling for a fight with us,
[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:14.461]  I don't care what they say.
[03:33:14.461 --> 03:33:15.161]  We've proven it.
[03:33:15.161 --> 03:33:16.042]  They are ready.
[03:33:16.042 --> 03:33:17.563]  Look at Kent State.
[03:33:17.563 --> 03:33:19.144]  And our military's been taken over.
[03:33:19.144 --> 03:33:28.569]  You have G20 global leaders meeting openly in mainstream news to get rid of the dollar and bring in quote global governance.
[03:33:28.569 --> 03:33:36.594]  This is the end of our country and the police and the military are acting like people that don't like it are pure scum and terrorists because the DHS has trained them to do that.
[03:33:36.594 --> 03:33:37.615]  Hermes, what's happening now?
[03:33:39.126 --> 03:33:46.009]  I am backing off, but a good majority of the protesters, mostly anarchists and black and brown, are making it down.
[03:33:46.009 --> 03:33:48.311]  You can probably hear them right now.
[03:33:48.311 --> 03:33:51.252]  Then this is probably a staged event and they're with the police.
[03:33:51.252 --> 03:33:55.694]  They're probably going to go to a normal protest and then try to claim the... Get out of there!
[03:33:55.694 --> 03:33:57.015]  Alright.
[03:33:57.015 --> 03:33:58.736]  Are you getting away from them?
[03:33:58.736 --> 03:34:00.637]  Yeah, I'm backing up, I'm backing up.
[03:34:00.637 --> 03:34:02.998]  How far away are you from them?
[03:34:02.998 --> 03:34:04.739]  Probably about 1-200 feet away.
[03:34:07.734 --> 03:34:11.996]  And so the LRAD is further away, and what, drove them back?
[03:34:11.996 --> 03:34:20.080]  Yeah, what they've been doing is, as the police now in certain areas, they'll take certain side streets, because we're outside of the main city of Pittsburgh.
[03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:27.024]  This started in Lawrence, about a mile and a half away, and originally in the park, where riot police had gathered.
[03:34:28.055 --> 03:34:31.357]  They decided that they would go the other direction.
[03:34:31.357 --> 03:34:34.138]  There were no riot police set up there at first.
[03:34:34.138 --> 03:34:38.161]  Then the police cordoned them off where the sound weapons were.
[03:34:38.161 --> 03:34:43.424]  They then moved to the right-hand side by the time I had turned around to cover the protesters.
[03:34:43.424 --> 03:34:45.385]  The majority of them were already gone.
[03:34:45.385 --> 03:34:53.589]  This is the first time since then that I've been around them, but I can already tell that they've been able to disperse the crowd by at least three-fifths.
[03:34:55.572 --> 03:34:58.496]  I mean, this car was much larger than it was before.
[03:34:58.496 --> 03:35:05.847]  And Jason, just to be clear, just to be clear, don't stay at the head of them, go down to Side Street, get out of there right now, okay?
[03:35:05.847 --> 03:35:08.991]  I am on Side Street right now and they're passing me, Alex.
[03:35:08.991 --> 03:35:11.094]  I have no police on me at this point.
[03:35:11.094 --> 03:35:12.076]  They have not caught up.
[03:35:12.358 --> 03:35:14.879]  You're going to see the police following them later.
[03:35:14.879 --> 03:35:18.481]  They'll be hungry for blood and to engage their enemy, the American people.
[03:35:18.481 --> 03:35:22.022]  And so, they may corner you in that alley or side street.
[03:35:22.022 --> 03:35:23.883]  Here come the anarchist staging.
[03:35:23.883 --> 03:35:25.743]  Here they come right now.
[03:35:25.743 --> 03:35:27.784]  They just grabbed a dumpster.
[03:35:27.784 --> 03:35:28.605]  They're flipping it over.
[03:35:28.605 --> 03:35:30.065]  I got it.
[03:35:30.065 --> 03:35:32.166]  I got it on tape right now.
[03:35:32.166 --> 03:35:36.648]  I don't want to put you in danger, Jason, but if you follow that stinking fed, is it a big guy?
[03:35:37.594 --> 03:35:41.096]  Alright, it was three people, and of course they had masks on, Alex.
[03:35:41.096 --> 03:35:46.619]  I earlier followed a couple people that I caught spray-painting, a couple that were throwing eggs.
[03:35:46.619 --> 03:35:51.502]  I mean, I am, you know, I am desperately trying to cover this the best that I can.
[03:35:51.502 --> 03:35:54.124]  You are kicking butt, my friend.
[03:35:54.124 --> 03:36:02.089]  So the operatives... The operatives are... Recap, so we have a record.
[03:36:02.089 --> 03:36:07.192]  You did see military with the LRAD police, and you've talked to military today.
[03:36:08.823 --> 03:36:10.864]  Yes, I talked to the military earlier today.
[03:36:10.864 --> 03:36:15.346]  They were at a, uh, there were five people outside of a Humvee.
[03:36:15.346 --> 03:36:22.849]  Basically, most of the Humvees in the military were coordinating off at checkpoints on Main Street in the main city of Pittsburgh.
[03:36:22.849 --> 03:36:23.489]  I approached them.
[03:36:24.386 --> 03:36:28.147]  I asked them what their mission was, they said it was to assist the police.
[03:36:28.147 --> 03:36:35.209]  I asked them what they would have to say to their critics, that this was a violation of posse comitatus, and of course none of them knew what that was.
[03:36:35.209 --> 03:36:46.652]  I then had to explain to them that that was the separation of military and police, and it was the standard boilerplate answer of, you know, we're just following orders.
[03:36:46.652 --> 03:36:47.613]  Unbelievable.
[03:36:47.613 --> 03:36:52.354]  Now, you did see troops, National Guard or Army, with the police with the LRAD cannon?
[03:36:54.599 --> 03:36:57.000]  Like I said, they were in full military fatigues.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:01.683]  I mean, these weren't just the pants, they were the tops.
[03:37:01.683 --> 03:37:10.309]  Yesterday, at the Clean Air Concert, although when I approached them and I asked them whether they were military, they told me they were police.
[03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:19.114]  However, they had no police numbers, no identification as police, and they were wearing the American flag backwards, in green, in full military and riot gear.
[03:37:19.534 --> 03:37:21.075]  So I think they're lying to me as well.
[03:37:21.075 --> 03:37:23.836]  Well of course, that's what they do to their enemy, the American people.
[03:37:23.836 --> 03:37:29.659]  Um, Bermas, briefly, and we're gonna go to Sherry Tinpenny, briefly, tell folks about last night.
[03:37:29.659 --> 03:37:38.943]  You guys pull up to the gate, you ask to talk to the public information officer, they called the police and lied and said that you were sneaking around, you ran from them, is that true?
[03:37:39.893 --> 03:37:41.053]  Absolutely not.
[03:37:41.053 --> 03:37:42.834]  You know, we went up to the main gate.
[03:37:42.834 --> 03:37:48.575]  We asked the officer if he could discuss what the 2,500 troops would be doing in Pittsburgh tomorrow.
[03:37:48.575 --> 03:37:49.496]  He said he couldn't.
[03:37:49.496 --> 03:37:52.856]  He then told us that he could get a representative that could, or a phone number.
[03:37:52.856 --> 03:37:55.757]  We then pulled off to the side of the road where they instructed us to.
[03:37:55.757 --> 03:37:57.898]  We waited around 15 or 20 minutes.
[03:37:57.898 --> 03:38:00.078]  Our representative came back immediately.
[03:38:00.078 --> 03:38:01.419]  He was hostile towards us.
[03:38:01.419 --> 03:38:02.799]  He did not like our credentials.
[03:38:02.799 --> 03:38:04.419]  He said he would not answer our questions.
[03:38:04.419 --> 03:38:04.899]  Yeah, I heard him.
[03:38:04.899 --> 03:38:06.300]  I was on cell phone with him.
[03:38:06.300 --> 03:38:06.600]  Go ahead.
[03:38:08.012 --> 03:38:10.833]  Exactly, and we tried to get as much information as we could.
[03:38:10.833 --> 03:38:16.414]  He refused to answer our questions, so then Rob asked him for his information and where we could contact him.
[03:38:16.414 --> 03:38:20.475]  Tomorrow, if we could get a word with him, he then gave it, and we left.
[03:38:20.475 --> 03:38:21.736]  We didn't run away from anything.
[03:38:21.736 --> 03:38:34.959]  By the time that we had left, turned around, and exited the main military facility, there was another car parked on the other side of the road, waiting for us to pass, follow us for an exit, then got off, and then we were shot.
[03:38:35.559 --> 03:38:43.927]  When Douglas got a call trying to entrap him and have us go return our rental car for quote-unquote two more free days.
[03:38:43.927 --> 03:38:51.534]  When we didn't offer that, he then came clean and said he was actually military personnel and he wanted to know whether or not we were terrorists, Alex.
[03:38:51.534 --> 03:38:55.718]  And then he told Douglas, you're on a list now, pal, for the rest of your life.
[03:38:57.952 --> 03:38:59.114]  With pleasure.
[03:38:59.114 --> 03:39:02.640]  And they'll take your houses, they'll take your guns, they'll take your wives.
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:04.143]  They do it all over the world.
[03:39:04.143 --> 03:39:05.926]  They want to do it here.
[03:39:05.926 --> 03:39:07.830]  They'd love to kill 10 million Americans.
[03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:09.412]  A million Iraqis isn't enough.
[03:39:12.551 --> 03:39:14.051]  It is unbelievable.
[03:39:14.051 --> 03:39:16.212]  I'm glad to say I saw Cindy Sheehan out here.
[03:39:16.212 --> 03:39:17.713]  She has a presence.
[03:39:17.713 --> 03:39:22.154]  I've talked to some other people with InfoWars banners, Investigate911 t-shirts.
[03:39:22.154 --> 03:39:26.495]  Not everybody here is under the spell of the provocative and the anarchist.
[03:39:51.850 --> 03:39:58.056]  If you do not disperse, you may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:39:58.056 --> 03:39:59.877]  I'm turning it on right now!
[03:39:59.877 --> 03:40:00.878]  Let him finish!
[03:40:00.878 --> 03:40:03.060]  Let him finish, Burmese!
[03:40:03.060 --> 03:40:05.462]  Yes!
[03:40:05.462 --> 03:40:06.483]  Video tape it!
[03:40:06.483 --> 03:40:12.648]  This could cause risk of injury to those who are in it.
[03:40:12.648 --> 03:40:13.088]  Where is he?
[03:40:14.412 --> 03:40:18.935]  They're about, I would say, about 60 yards in front of me.
[03:40:18.935 --> 03:40:22.418]  All of the protesters are now turning around.
[03:40:22.418 --> 03:40:23.779]  They've cordoned that area off.
[03:40:23.779 --> 03:40:25.981]  Here it comes again.
[03:40:25.981 --> 03:40:27.422]  That's what the sound blast sounds like.
[03:40:50.737 --> 03:40:55.823]  Bermas, did you say that the protesters are turned around because they're blocked in?
[03:40:55.823 --> 03:40:57.425]  Yes, they are blocked in!
[03:40:57.425 --> 03:40:58.225]  Ron, get out!
[03:40:58.225 --> 03:40:59.147]  I told you!
[03:40:59.147 --> 03:41:02.090]  Go down the side street, get the hell out of there or they're going to get you!
[03:41:02.090 --> 03:41:03.772]  Get out of there right now!
[03:41:03.772 --> 03:41:05.154]  I told you!
[03:41:05.154 --> 03:41:05.975]  Get the hell out of there!
[03:41:05.975 --> 03:41:06.735]  Stop videoing!
[03:41:06.735 --> 03:41:07.496]  Get out of there now!
[03:41:08.285 --> 03:41:09.105]  Okay.
[03:41:09.105 --> 03:41:09.806]  Are you leaving?
[03:41:09.806 --> 03:41:12.707]  Yes, yes, I'm turning left-hand corner right now.
[03:41:12.707 --> 03:41:18.429]  Okay, yeah, let the little feds, they're all getting paid to do this, let them have their little staged event.
[03:41:18.429 --> 03:41:20.871]  This is going to later be packaged for the news.
[03:41:20.871 --> 03:41:25.392]  They'll say it happened later today, and then they're going to attack any other peaceful protest.
[03:41:25.392 --> 03:41:34.216]  I need all InfoWarriors, anyone in the Northeast, anybody in the Midwest, to go to Pittsburgh now with video cameras.
[03:41:34.216 --> 03:41:37.338]  The troops are bought and paid for by offshore banks.
[03:41:38.118 --> 03:41:40.742]  The republic is falling right now.
[03:41:40.742 --> 03:41:45.289]  They are openly destroying our precious republic right now.
[03:41:45.289 --> 03:41:47.753]  They are openly bringing in martial law.
[03:41:47.753 --> 03:41:49.837]  They have troops deploying in every major city.
[03:41:49.837 --> 03:41:52.701]  This is just another beta test.
[03:41:53.502 --> 03:41:56.343]  And we need everybody to go to Pittsburgh who loves this country.
[03:41:56.343 --> 03:42:00.726]  Veterans, everybody that want to truly have a chance to stand for America.
[03:42:00.726 --> 03:42:02.406]  You're going to see more and more of this happen.
[03:42:02.406 --> 03:42:08.950]  Come with cameras, radio hosts, everybody needs to get there and needs to expose these people.
[03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:11.091]  And we need people to follow the anarchist.
[03:42:12.231 --> 03:42:14.132]  Well, I'm down the street.
[03:42:14.132 --> 03:42:14.452]  I can see the...
[03:42:32.020 --> 03:42:33.721]  Street where the main protesters are going.
[03:42:33.721 --> 03:42:36.982]  They're going in the opposite direction it looks like.
[03:42:36.982 --> 03:42:38.742]  I hung a left, they're hanging a right.
[03:42:38.742 --> 03:42:54.967]  But see what the cops do is they make the protesters think they're in control and only block certain streets and they will herd them to a dead end where all the cops are waiting with tear gas and rubber bullets and I got video and all they'll walk up to an old lady and with every bit of force with a club go
[03:42:55.367 --> 03:42:56.247]  Yeah!
[03:42:56.247 --> 03:42:57.728]  Just with death blow power!
[03:42:57.728 --> 03:42:58.288]  Yeah!
[03:42:58.288 --> 03:42:58.668]  Yeah!
[03:42:58.668 --> 03:43:00.789]  And break their, break their collarbone.
[03:43:00.789 --> 03:43:04.831]  I mean, that's in police state to the takeover and the cops will high-five, the troops will high-five.
[03:43:04.831 --> 03:43:06.472]  Ain't nothing like American blood.
[03:43:06.472 --> 03:43:08.073]  They just, I hate America!
[03:43:08.073 --> 03:43:08.933]  Yeah!
[03:43:08.933 --> 03:43:09.973]  Yeah!
[03:43:09.973 --> 03:43:13.115]  I mean, this is what they're doing and so get the hell out of there.
[03:43:13.115 --> 03:43:18.077]  But we need just thousands of people to go to Pittsburgh to peacefully expose these people, but
[03:43:18.357 --> 03:43:37.544]  Again, they'll let the anarchists go, they'll pick out a few old ladies, they love weak people, like wolves, wolves love weak animals, and they will just, I mean, I mean I got video in Police Station at the Takeover, you've seen it Burmese, where that old lady's just in a neighborhood, and the police come up and start stomping her, or the military, excuse me, with full power.
[03:43:38.524 --> 03:43:39.705]  Well, they're armed to the teeth today, Alex.
[03:43:39.705 --> 03:43:40.886]  Well, they're armed to the teeth.
[03:43:40.886 --> 03:43:42.927]  I mean, these guys have shotguns.
[03:43:42.927 --> 03:43:50.031]  They look like, like I said, while I was talking to you initially, they all put on the tear gas mask.
[03:43:50.031 --> 03:43:51.072]  I got out of that vicinity.
[03:43:51.072 --> 03:43:52.613]  I don't know if they let any of those off.
[03:44:01.235 --> 03:44:03.776]  But, I mean, these guys are in full garb.
[03:44:03.776 --> 03:44:05.216]  I got some really great shots.
[03:44:05.216 --> 03:44:09.778]  They want the guns, they want the money, they will put us in dirt pits and shoot us.
[03:44:09.778 --> 03:44:11.518]  We've seen this in every other country.
[03:44:11.518 --> 03:44:14.339]  They are training them on blood, training them to attack us.
[03:44:14.339 --> 03:44:18.860]  They're like attack dogs being trained, you know, on baby kittens, how to kill them.
[03:44:18.860 --> 03:44:21.301]  I mean, that's all that's happening is death training.
[03:44:24.171 --> 03:44:25.452]  I can't disagree, Alex.
[03:44:25.452 --> 03:44:26.673]  It's pretty wild, man.
[03:44:26.673 --> 03:44:33.479]  Hey, you've seen the videos of the troops and contractors shooting families in their cars, driving down Baghdad highways and laughing.
[03:44:33.479 --> 03:44:37.522]  Children being filled full of holes is just a celebration of love.
[03:44:37.522 --> 03:44:39.844]  It's just that they're into how they murder innocents.
[03:44:39.844 --> 03:44:40.444]  These people are pure evil.
[03:44:46.061 --> 03:44:47.101]  I'm sorry, I'm so out of breath.
[03:44:47.101 --> 03:44:48.062]  I've been running around so much.
[03:44:48.062 --> 03:44:48.522]  Where are you now?
[03:44:48.522 --> 03:44:49.262]  Where are you now?
[03:44:49.262 --> 03:44:50.122]  I am on the 5th street.
[03:44:50.122 --> 03:44:51.763]  Actually, Cindy Sheehan's right next to me.
[03:44:51.763 --> 03:44:53.123]  She just walked down here.
[03:44:53.123 --> 03:44:54.403]  But I'm on a calm street.
[03:44:54.403 --> 03:44:55.384]  There's nobody around me.
[03:44:55.384 --> 03:44:56.464]  Let me say hi to Cindy Sheehan.
[03:44:56.464 --> 03:44:57.404]  Put Cindy Sheehan on.
[03:44:57.404 --> 03:44:58.504]  Alright, hold on one second.
[03:44:58.504 --> 03:45:00.425]  Let me get her on the phone.
[03:45:00.425 --> 03:45:01.465]  Alex Jones, on air.
[03:45:01.465 --> 03:45:03.026]  I'd like to talk to you really quickly.
[03:45:03.026 --> 03:45:05.106]  Hey Alex!
[03:45:05.106 --> 03:45:07.787]  Cindy, you've now been hit by the army and police.
[03:45:07.787 --> 03:45:11.308]  This is like, this is like Kent State with sound weapons.
[03:45:11.308 --> 03:45:14.209]  This is huge news and it's nowhere on TV.
[03:45:14.209 --> 03:45:15.169]  Cindy, tell us what happened.
[03:45:16.001 --> 03:45:33.754]  Well, you know, we've just been trying to get, uh, lawfully assemble and peaceably march, but we were just in a place where there was like 600 cops in full riot gear, and they are, um, they do have the sound weapons, and they do have the microwave weapons, so... Oh, wait, you saw the microwave gun?
[03:45:33.754 --> 03:45:36.236]  Oh, heck yeah!
[03:45:36.236 --> 03:45:39.939]  Oh my God, those things can kill you on high beam.
[03:45:39.939 --> 03:45:41.640]  And we were really close, too.
[03:45:41.640 --> 03:45:43.542]  Yeah, this is America, Alex.
[03:45:43.542 --> 03:45:45.163]  This is the country my son died for.
[03:45:51.079 --> 03:45:52.780]  Cindy Sheehan, give us a quick report.
[03:45:52.780 --> 03:45:55.382]  What have you seen with the LRAD and the microwave guns?
[03:45:55.382 --> 03:45:56.443]  No, no, no.
[03:45:56.443 --> 03:45:57.303]  They've turned them on.
[03:45:57.303 --> 03:45:59.225]  They've turned them on on my guys.
[03:45:59.225 --> 03:45:59.905]  We've heard it.
[03:46:09.721 --> 03:46:11.762]  Today, see, I wasn't aware.
[03:46:11.762 --> 03:46:18.407]  We're just trying to get to downtown so we can exercise our freedom of speech, Alex.
[03:46:18.407 --> 03:46:22.590]  And, you know, they're blocking peaceful protesters.
[03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:23.671]  We don't have any weapons.
[03:46:23.671 --> 03:46:29.996]  They're blocking us with the most disastrous, horrible weapons that they can think of.
[03:46:29.996 --> 03:46:34.299]  And so, yeah, it's just really awful down here.
[03:46:36.355 --> 03:46:42.838]  And they've also learned how to get around vinegar if you soak your bandana in vinegar.
[03:46:42.838 --> 03:46:44.619]  It's supposed to stop the tear gas.
[03:46:44.619 --> 03:46:52.303]  But they've put baking soda in their tear gas, so it'll make the bandana even more dangerous.
[03:46:55.575 --> 03:46:56.957]  This is just incredible.
[03:46:56.957 --> 03:47:02.806]  And here you are constantly fighting in Martha's Vineyard in Crawford, Texas.
[03:47:02.806 --> 03:47:06.972]  Cindy, did you know they're openly announcing the formation of a world government at this meeting?
[03:47:06.972 --> 03:47:08.594]  Yes, I know they are.
[03:47:08.594 --> 03:47:09.095]  Yes, I do.
[03:47:09.884 --> 03:47:18.475]  I mean, even the head of the EU even spoke out against it, Kloss, at the UN yesterday, and they're openly announcing the end of the dollar.
[03:47:18.475 --> 03:47:28.087]  Those troops don't know that their whole savings and their whole family future is gone, and there they are with pleasure, guarding the very government that is illegitimate and criminal.
[03:47:28.786 --> 03:47:35.772]  Well, I tried to lead a battalion of them to the G20 so we can arrest the people who are really our enemies.
[03:47:35.772 --> 03:47:37.373]  The troops are out here.
[03:47:37.373 --> 03:47:39.354]  There are brothers and sisters.
[03:47:39.354 --> 03:47:40.856]  There are sons and daughters.
[03:47:40.856 --> 03:47:42.777]  And there are mothers and fathers.
[03:47:42.777 --> 03:47:44.378]  And they're turning their guns on us.
[03:47:44.378 --> 03:47:46.280]  They're turning their weapons on us.
[03:47:46.280 --> 03:47:49.743]  We really should be marching to the G20 and arresting those guys.
[03:47:49.743 --> 03:47:51.324]  Those guys are planning nothing but
[03:47:56.265 --> 03:48:08.013]  They're the bankers that engineered it all and now they're announcing a new global currency and the end of the dollar which will destroy our economy and the police... Here they come again with their LRAD, Alex.
[03:48:08.013 --> 03:48:09.654]  You see it?
[03:48:09.654 --> 03:48:10.595]  Well, I hear it.
[03:48:10.595 --> 03:48:16.198]  They always announce it on a loudspeaker before they bring it, so they're coming with it.
[03:48:16.198 --> 03:48:17.259]  They have us blocked in.
[03:48:19.847 --> 03:48:21.648]  CNN is finally covering it.
[03:48:21.648 --> 03:48:23.989]  They're only covering a few anarchists.
[03:48:23.989 --> 03:48:27.670]  That's Fox, excuse me.
[03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:30.392]  Listen, I want to get a report from you tomorrow, Cindy.
[03:48:30.392 --> 03:48:34.754]  We have your cell phone number, don't we?
[03:48:34.754 --> 03:48:37.295]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:48:41.755 --> 03:48:46.204]  God bless you, Cindy Sheehan.
[03:48:46.204 --> 03:48:48.448]  You see the best people together in one spot.
[03:48:48.448 --> 03:48:49.610]  Burmess, what's happening now?
[03:48:50.942 --> 03:48:53.303]  Um, right now, like I said, we're on this side street.
[03:48:53.303 --> 03:48:58.326]  We just did get a couple thumbs up from some of the firefighters that obviously don't want to be a part of this.
[03:48:58.326 --> 03:49:01.947]  They saw Cindy and, you know, they obviously are fans of what she does.
[03:49:01.947 --> 03:49:07.490]  Uh, I heard that LRAD, again, it was over to the right and maybe two blocks up.
[03:49:07.490 --> 03:49:10.551]  I can't really see any of the protesters at this point.
[03:49:10.551 --> 03:49:16.274]  Uh, we're on train tracks and you can kind of glare into the city down the train tracks.
[03:49:16.274 --> 03:49:18.455]  I can see a couple of officers
[03:49:18.875 --> 03:49:22.117]  And vehicles, but nothing to the extent of where they're cornering people.
[03:49:22.117 --> 03:49:26.079]  I mean, when they're cornering people, you're talking hundreds of riot cops.
[03:49:26.079 --> 03:49:29.020]  No, I know, but that was going on deeper in the area you can't see.
[03:49:29.020 --> 03:49:30.361]  Get out of there.
[03:49:30.361 --> 03:49:32.142]  Call the guys.
[03:49:32.142 --> 03:49:36.003]  Burma's just... Just get out of there so we know at least one camera gets out, okay?
[03:49:36.003 --> 03:49:38.445]  All right, you got it, sir.
[03:49:38.445 --> 03:49:40.926]  And they've got all the world leaders landing on TV.
[03:49:40.926 --> 03:49:41.446]  Uh, Jason?
[03:49:41.446 --> 03:49:44.408]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:44.408 --> 03:49:45.388]  Yes, sir, to you.
[03:49:45.388 --> 03:49:46.188]  You're doing a great job.
[03:49:46.188 --> 03:49:46.849]  Just call...
[03:49:47.972 --> 03:49:54.094]  Call... Did we ever get a hold of Jason Douglas?
[03:49:54.094 --> 03:49:56.315]  I still haven't because I'm still on this phone here.
[03:49:56.315 --> 03:49:58.556]  I've got to... Yeah, because that's what I said 30 minutes ago.
[03:49:58.556 --> 03:50:02.338]  I want to keep calling Jason Douglas' phone.
[03:50:02.338 --> 03:50:05.459]  Oh, those guys are calling Jason Douglas' phone.
[03:50:05.459 --> 03:50:08.540]  Okay, Mike Nelson's been calling over and over again and he's not answering.
[03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:12.822]  Text Douglas and tell him he's done enough.
[03:50:12.822 --> 03:50:13.422]  Get out of there.
[03:50:14.212 --> 03:50:15.773]  Okay, I will do that.
[03:50:15.773 --> 03:50:17.094]  Okay, I will do that.
[03:50:17.094 --> 03:50:19.196]  Yeah, Burmese, you tell him where you want to meet.
[03:50:19.196 --> 03:50:21.857]  Just like... Oh my God.
[03:50:21.857 --> 03:50:23.519]  Alright, good job, Jason.
[03:50:23.519 --> 03:50:23.839]  Okay.
[03:50:23.839 --> 03:50:28.282]  We're going to keep you on hold until you... Well, we'll call you back in five minutes.
[03:50:28.282 --> 03:50:29.363]  Sounds great, Alex.
[03:50:29.363 --> 03:50:30.303]  Thank you.
[03:50:30.303 --> 03:50:33.446]  Sherry Tenpenny, what do you think of this?
[03:50:33.446 --> 03:50:34.927]  I'm speechless, Alex.
[03:50:34.927 --> 03:50:36.007]  I'm just speechless.
[03:50:36.007 --> 03:50:38.669]  It's like it is here.
[03:50:38.669 --> 03:50:39.430]  It is here.
[03:50:41.550 --> 03:50:45.753]  I want to come back with you in the final segment and get some final comments from you and any new developments here.
[03:50:45.753 --> 03:50:55.439]  All the scumbag bankers that are robbing our country are arriving live right now while our police and military, bought off and brainwashed by them, are having their way with people.
[03:50:55.439 --> 03:51:01.443]  With a few staged anarchists, I guarantee you are either feds or police officers or foundation-hired scum.
[03:51:03.658 --> 03:51:10.920]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:14.341]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?
[03:51:14.341 --> 03:51:15.502]  Well, now you can.
[03:51:15.502 --> 03:51:17.682]  Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.

[03:51:34.930 --> 03:51:39.914]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.

[03:52:04.019 --> 03:52:10.044]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:10.044 --> 03:52:15.929]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:15.929 --> 03:52:22.095]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.435 --> 03:52:24.396]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.396 --> 03:52:26.858]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.858 --> 03:52:40.047]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:40.047 --> 03:52:41.728]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:41.728 --> 03:52:43.590]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:43.590 --> 03:52:49.794]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:50.487 --> 03:52:58.739]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:58.739 --> 03:53:00.321]  The Obama Deception.
[03:53:00.321 --> 03:53:01.522]  The people strike back!

[03:53:56.454 --> 03:53:57.975]  SpyVille.com.
[03:53:57.975 --> 03:54:00.316]  Spy cameras and security equipment since 1997.
[03:54:06.949 --> 03:54:10.570]  This is all about training you that you're not supposed to protest and demonstrate.
[03:54:10.570 --> 03:54:12.991]  That's why the police pose as anarchists in every case.
[03:54:12.991 --> 03:54:14.271]  They've been caught over and over again.
[03:54:14.271 --> 03:54:17.592]  That's why they're using sound guns, microwave weapons.
[03:54:17.592 --> 03:54:19.212]  We know they use the sound guns.
[03:54:19.212 --> 03:54:21.353]  The microwave guns are there.
[03:54:21.353 --> 03:54:24.434]  Amazing to have Burmese and Cindy Sheehan and all these people together.
[03:54:24.434 --> 03:54:25.474]  They're standing as tyranny.
[03:54:25.474 --> 03:54:27.795]  She lost her son.
[03:54:27.795 --> 03:54:31.496]  And the military will follow orders and that's all this is.
[03:54:31.496 --> 03:54:35.317]  And there are the bankers openly setting up world government, bankrupting us by design.
[03:54:37.745 --> 03:54:47.607]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, this is how the Republic falls, with the stormtroopers in the streets and the world leaders coming to our country to sell it out and the mainstream news reporting it.
[03:54:47.607 --> 03:54:50.488]  Yes, um, Alex, why are they in Pittsburgh?
[03:54:50.488 --> 03:54:54.869]  Of all the cities in America, why Pittsburgh?
[03:54:54.869 --> 03:54:58.310]  Because it's got a lot of draconian laws in Pennsylvania.
[03:54:58.310 --> 03:55:01.931]  From what we've seen, they have a local Patriot Act, a state Patriot Act, and
[03:55:02.982 --> 03:55:07.504]  They chose it because they like cities that have tyranny, like London and D.C.
[03:55:07.504 --> 03:55:09.285]  and places like that.
[03:55:09.285 --> 03:55:12.267]  And they've chosen it to come here and kill the dollar in America.
[03:55:12.267 --> 03:55:13.127]  It's a big joke to them.
[03:55:13.127 --> 03:55:14.468]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[03:55:14.468 --> 03:55:16.929]  World government, end of the dollar.
[03:55:16.929 --> 03:55:24.013]  And Ron Paul earlier, he's an economist, not just a medical doctor, he said this will just, it'll be worse than the Great Depression if they kill the dollar.
[03:55:24.013 --> 03:55:28.175]  And they are doing it.
[03:55:28.175 --> 03:55:29.015]  Wow.
[03:55:29.015 --> 03:55:30.476]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[03:55:30.476 --> 03:55:32.357]  It's things that you and I have been talking about.
[03:55:33.341 --> 03:55:38.864]  And other people have been talking about for weeks, months, and years, and it looks like it's here.
[03:55:38.864 --> 03:55:41.146]  Well, at least we can expose the flu shot.
[03:55:41.146 --> 03:55:46.889]  At least we can get the flyers, the materials, and educate people, and speak out at our city councils.
[03:55:46.889 --> 03:55:48.070]  This is all at the local level.
[03:55:48.070 --> 03:56:01.017]  This takeover is happening through the Federal, International, and everybody just better become Infowarriors and get involved today, because what everybody just heard, and as this develops, I may do a special live broadcast, so just listen to the Infowar streams.
[03:56:01.017 --> 03:56:01.758]  Ron Paul and
[03:56:02.518 --> 03:56:08.504]  Congressman Grayson and everybody are coming back up on the restreams at InfoWars.com and AM and FM stations where we air the show.
[03:56:08.504 --> 03:56:11.967]  But as stuff develops tonight, we'll post at InfoWars.
[03:56:11.967 --> 03:56:18.253]  If we're about to go live, then we'll go live on internet only at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[03:56:18.253 --> 03:56:20.895]  I'm here finishing my film, Fall of the Republic, today.
[03:56:20.895 --> 03:56:21.316]  I'm finished.
[03:56:21.316 --> 03:56:21.976]  It's done today.
[03:56:22.517 --> 03:56:27.000]  We're just doing some final things with the DVD menu and adding a few more documents.
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:30.142]  And I will be here... I mean, follow the Republic.
[03:56:30.142 --> 03:56:33.365]  This is the end of the Bill of Rights, the end of the Constitution.
[03:56:33.365 --> 03:56:37.628]  The Senate admits the Patriot Act's being used everywhere for misdemeanor crimes.
[03:56:37.628 --> 03:56:38.988]  No more warrants.
[03:56:38.988 --> 03:56:42.151]  The police are taking blood all over the country without warrants at checkpoints.
[03:56:42.151 --> 03:56:45.233]  I mean, Doctor, it's really happening.
[03:56:45.233 --> 03:56:46.474]  It is happening.
[03:56:46.474 --> 03:56:46.714]  It is.
[03:56:47.805 --> 03:56:49.126]  It's really scary, Alex.
[03:56:49.126 --> 03:56:53.188]  I mean, it's really kind of frightening to see this stuff happening in real time.
[03:56:53.188 --> 03:57:04.913]  Now, I'm sitting at home in my living room, and they did have a little bit of a snip on CNN and on Fox News, but nothing like what your guys on the streets have captured.
[03:57:04.913 --> 03:57:10.396]  Well, here's the Examiner newspaper reporting on these sound weapons at the tea parties.
[03:57:11.815 --> 03:57:15.897]  It says, uh, both town halls took place without incident.
[03:57:15.897 --> 03:57:20.080]  However, the use of military device concerned San Diegans.
[03:57:20.080 --> 03:57:27.304]  The LRAD crowd control is primarily used in Iraq to control insurgents and can cause serious and lasting harm to humans.
[03:57:27.304 --> 03:57:29.065]  And they admit this.
[03:57:29.065 --> 03:57:32.647]  I mean, this is just outrageous.
[03:57:32.647 --> 03:57:40.932]  Well, it'll be interesting to see what unfolds for the rest of the evening, and it'll be very interesting tomorrow to see what's been posted on Prison Planet and what
[03:57:41.297 --> 03:57:45.340]  What sort of news clips that you've actually been able to put together.
[03:57:45.340 --> 03:57:47.121]  Thank you for all the work you do, Alex.
[03:57:47.121 --> 03:57:47.961]  Thank you very much.
[03:57:47.961 --> 03:57:48.882]  Well, thank you, doctor.
[03:57:48.882 --> 03:57:50.823]  The website is DrTinPenny.com.
[03:57:50.823 --> 03:57:55.366]  And what's the other one for the flyers to educate people and to leave at drugstores?
[03:57:55.366 --> 03:57:57.708]  PandemicFluOnline.com.
[03:57:57.708 --> 03:57:59.449]  PandemicFluOnline.com.
[03:57:59.449 --> 03:58:01.990]  Click on the toolbox and everything there's for you.
[03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.791]  God bless you, doctor.
[03:58:02.791 --> 03:58:03.952]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:58:03.952 --> 03:58:04.232]  All right.
[03:58:04.232 --> 03:58:04.952]  Take care.
[03:58:04.952 --> 03:58:05.573]  This unfolds.
[03:58:07.148 --> 03:58:17.257]  We're going to rebroadcast right now, but I could go live the next 20 minutes again only on the Infowars.com streams and presentplanet.tv video, so watch this space.
[03:58:17.257 --> 03:58:19.939]  We won't be on the AM and FM until tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:58:19.939 --> 03:58:24.583]  Central Standard Time, 12 noon Eastern on the AM and FM and the shortwave.
[03:58:24.583 --> 03:58:25.644]  WWCR doing a great job.
[03:58:27.085 --> 03:58:28.146]  Pray for my guys.
[03:58:28.146 --> 03:58:29.066]  Pray for everybody there.
[03:58:29.066 --> 03:58:30.526]  Pray for Cindy Sheehan.
[03:58:30.526 --> 03:58:31.727]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:31.727 --> 03:58:34.487]  Great job, Genesis, and everybody that makes this show possible.
[03:58:34.487 --> 03:58:37.628]  We will continue to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:58:37.628 --> 03:58:43.850]  The Republic is being brought down right now, not with a bang, but with a whimper.
[03:58:43.850 --> 03:58:45.011]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.011 --> 03:58:46.431]  Retransmission starts now at Infowars.com.
[03:58:46.431 --> 03:58:47.551]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:47.551 --> 03:58:49.172]  Retransmission starts now at Infowars.com.
[03:58:50.663 --> 03:58:51.604]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:51.604 --> 03:58:54.746]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.746 --> 03:58:58.368]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.368 --> 03:59:02.931]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.931 --> 03:59:08.535]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.815 --> 03:59:13.598]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
