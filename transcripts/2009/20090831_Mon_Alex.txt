[00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:05.645]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.285]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.928]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:24.948 --> 00:00:26.029]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.570]  We are here live.
[00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.911]  It is the last day of August.
[00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:33.334]  Can you believe we're about to be in the ninth month of 2009?
[00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.064]  Thank you again so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:48.648]  I am going to be massive news blitzing coming up in about 40 minutes.
[00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:50.029]  Huge news blitzing.
[00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.610]  I'm just going to go over the headlines.
[00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.573]  First we're going to take calls right now for the next 40 minutes.
[00:00:54.893 --> 00:01:00.398]  Then we have a special guest in the third and fourth hour I'll announce right before they join us coming up at the end of this hour.
[00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:08.785]  We're now also simulcasting the Syndicate Radio Show in the second, third, and fourth hour at PrisonPlanet.tv today.
[00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:11.006]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:13.809]  I want to just give everybody a heads up here.
[00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:25.899]  Coming up next Tuesday, September 8th, we're going to have a very special announcement, a huge announcement.
[00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:27.138]  Here on air.
[00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:31.139]  This will be the biggest single thing we have ever done.
[00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.361]  And that is coming up next Tuesday here on the show.
[00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.082]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:46.803]  And tell folks, you never know, I may even launch it early and do it Friday.
[00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:55.045]  The point is, I may take off Monday, take off from radio and be up here working on the new film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:06.279]  But, uh, the film's already great, but I've got, like, 15 days, 20 days, maybe, max, to finish it and send it off for mass production.
[00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.222]  And we're just racing to cut stuff out and add stuff.
[00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:12.383]  We've got too much material.
[00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:24.430]  I did 19 different flights, 19 different interviews, main interviews, and 30 or 40 more sit-downs with other people, man on the street, scientists, you name it, for Fall of the Republic.
[00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.310]  So that is something I've been working on really intensely.
[00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:38.073]  But we have something huge coming up on September 8th.
[00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:40.034]  I'm just going to leave it at that for everybody.
[00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:42.755]  And I'm not going to belabor it.
[00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:48.558]  My life is so weird.
[00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:52.089]  It is good to be empowered.
[00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.229]  It is good to be involved.
[00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.310]  It is good to be informed.
[00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.952]  It is good to be off the bench, in the field, taking action.
[00:02:58.172 --> 00:03:00.713]  What's the famous Teddy Roosevelt quote about in the arena?
[00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.494]  Pull that up for me, guys, please.
[00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:05.576]  The Teddy Roosevelt quote in the arena.
[00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:06.116]  Print that off.
[00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:07.237]  After I take some calls, I'm going to read it.
[00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:07.597]  Thank you.
[00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:12.019]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nelson in California.
[00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.000]  Nelson, you're on the air.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.340]  Welcome.
[00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:15.016]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:16.297]  This is my second time calling.
[00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:18.878]  I'm also a member of We Are Change in LA.
[00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:19.458]  Good!
[00:03:19.478 --> 00:03:20.559]  You're taking action!
[00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:28.843]  Yeah, one of the things I kind of brought up on the forum was talking about the Michael Moore's new movie, Capitalism Love Story.
[00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:31.484]  I've only watched the trailer.
[00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:48.287]  But, you know, knowing how his films have been in the past and seeing all his trailers... Yeah, he's gonna blame free market on what happened, not criminality, not offshore banks that actually fund the fake environmental movement, actually fund socialization of wealth so it can be pooled and extracted internationally.
[00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.428]  He's playing the false left-right paradigm.
[00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.949]  And our trailers got released the same day, unbeknownst to me.
[00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.330]  I didn't do that on purpose.
[00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:08.615]  Ours had more than him until Fall of the Republic did, until they put it on the main page as a featured video, as an advertisement, as the top bar, as the top ad on YouTube, and he's still barely beating us.
[00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:12.897]  I mean, people really are tired of his left-right system, but go ahead and make your point.
[00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:21.376]  Well, I just wanted to ask, you know, do you think we should be, uh, you know, at least protesting or not, not maybe boycotting the film, at least, at least when the movie premieres?
[00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:22.837]  When does it come out?
[00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.061]  Uh, I think was October 5th, I think, or 2nd.
[00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:31.285]  Yeah, ours comes out, uh, October 21st.
[00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:39.996]  And gets into the whole banking thing and how both parties are involved and how it's a criminal takeover, not socialist.
[00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:42.317]  Again, the media says it's socialist.
[00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:43.517]  This is not socialism.
[00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:46.098]  And I'm not a fan of socialism, but it's better than this.
[00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.059]  This is not socialism.
[00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:58.783]  I mean, if we're going to have the debt of $23.7 trillion and growing, it'll be $27.5 trillion again by the one-year anniversary, the way it's trending.
[00:04:59.864 --> 00:05:02.345]  That would pay for all the mortgages three times over.
[00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:03.863]  Three times.
[00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:05.704]  In one year.
[00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:07.246]  Nothing to do with mortgages.
[00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:08.387]  That's not socialism.
[00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:12.891]  Socialism would be taking money from the middle class and redistributing it.
[00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.192]  And from the rich.
[00:05:14.472 --> 00:05:16.194]  The rich are all tax-free and exempt.
[00:05:16.594 --> 00:05:17.735]  I haven't seen the trailer yet.
[00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:26.683]  I just... Burmess was showing me the numbers Sunday of, look, we have more views for your trailer than Michael Moore had until it was put at the top of the page, but go ahead.
[00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:28.485]  Well, yeah, that's great.
[00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:29.746]  That's pretty much just...
[00:05:30.342 --> 00:05:32.983]  You pretty much answered for me, just wanted your opinion on that.
[00:05:33.784 --> 00:05:40.788]  Oh yeah, he'll call, guaranteed, for a new global regulator over corporations.
[00:05:41.068 --> 00:05:44.950]  Which is what the global corporations that engineered this are calling for.
[00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:48.832]  So see, oh we screwed up, give us unlimited power.
[00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:57.857]  Just like in the 90s they said give us more power to stop any regulatory crises or economic crises and they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[00:05:58.157 --> 00:05:58.898]  I appreciate your call.
[00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:15.734]  In fact, a bunch of big scientific publications, including New Scientist, came out with reports that a handful of global banks own basically everything.
[00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:16.935]  Well, of course they do.
[00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:18.896]  They own the corporations, they own it all.
[00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:20.617]  These are just different subsidiaries.
[00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:25.681]  IBM, Microsoft, it's all government slash private corporate.
[00:06:26.812 --> 00:06:32.836]  Corruption is so bad now that you're not allowed to photograph royal families anywhere in the world.
[00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:42.042]  You can photograph any citizens you want, any movie stars you want on the street, but courts will rule for the Dutch and British royal family that it's illegal to photograph them.
[00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:42.883]  They're God.
[00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:47.606]  Because they own the oil companies, they own the derivatives, through fraud, they own everything.
[00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:48.627]  They're God.
[00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:51.909]  Then they're saying to you, you have no rights and you're their slave.
[00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:56.492]  You gotta say, 1776, I'm not your property scumbag!
[00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:02.636]  They just so happen to be a bunch of eugenicists who openly want to drug your water supply and your food.
[00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:13.364]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:26.013]  The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is
[00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:29.524]  Not effort without error and shortcomings.
[00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.225]  But who does actually strive to do the deed?
[00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:52.651]  Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotion, who spends himself in worthy causes, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat!
[00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.434]  Get out in the arena, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:56.835 --> 00:07:58.576]  Draw your sword in the info war.
[00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.998]  And go out and start hacking down our enemies.
[00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:02.878]  We have the truth.
[00:08:03.258 --> 00:08:04.259]  We have the passion.
[00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:05.520]  We have it all.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.222]  So deal destruction in the info war to the enemy.
[00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:12.343]  Unleash your power!
[00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:15.365]  Can't you feel it seething in you?
[00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.606]  Rising!
[00:08:17.574 --> 00:08:23.797]  Can't you feel your ancestors demanding that you shake off the fluoride and mercury haze?
[00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:27.659]  And that you rise up with power and strength and honor!
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.720]  And stand up for the innocent!
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.201]  Stand up for our country!
[00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.702]  Stand up to the parasites!
[00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:42.307]  All these lesser men bind themselves together in hordes and try to pull down the strong.
[00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:45.289]  Stand up to the eugenicist trash!
[00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:53.374]  Stand up to Rahm Emanuel's brother and tell them that they are not your gods, your owners, your kings!
[00:08:54.395 --> 00:09:03.200]  And that you have an absolute divine right as a free creature made in the image of the creator of the universe to be free!
[00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:12.706]  Thinker in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:19.245]  I had two things, but your talk right now is so strong, I'm going to start with the second one, if you don't mind.
[00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:20.445]  Sure.
[00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:23.406]  This is something from Mary Baker Eddy.
[00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:25.146]  I belong to no church.
[00:09:25.226 --> 00:09:27.367]  I want that to be very clear before I read this.
[00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:31.208]  She says, The great battle of Armageddon is upon us.
[00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:35.609]  The powers of evil are linked together in secret conspiracy against the Lord and his Christ.
[00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.291]  Large numbers in desperate malice are engaged day and night in organizing actions against us.
[00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:46.558]  Their feeling and purpose are deadly, and they have sworn enmity against the lives of our standard bearers.
[00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:47.818]  And it goes on like that.
[00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:49.559]  And that was written in 1886.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:56.203]  She knew that conspiracies were terrible then, and that they would be coming out more and more.
[00:09:56.843 --> 00:09:59.625]  And you're uncovering them now, and thank God for that.
[00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:06.569]  The question I had for you first was, and you answered it a little while ago, partly, but I would love it if you would make another comment.
[00:10:07.449 --> 00:10:10.531]  You said, every time the clouds come in, they chemtrail them out.
[00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:13.142]  We're having a terrible drought in Austin.
[00:10:13.182 --> 00:10:14.803]  The animals are staggering around.
[00:10:14.843 --> 00:10:15.744]  The plants are dying.
[00:10:15.984 --> 00:10:17.565]  Can you say a few more words about that?
[00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:19.786]  And after that, I have one more question, if I could.
[00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:22.367]  We're making a chemtrail film.
[00:10:22.407 --> 00:10:23.988]  We have the government's own documents.
[00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:25.129]  They admit they're doing it.
[00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:26.530]  En masse.
[00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:33.834]  And you tell the general thumb-sucking public on fluoride that they're chemical spraying us with barium salts and aluminum dioxide.
[00:10:34.294 --> 00:10:36.615]  That they come in and kill the cloud formations.
[00:10:37.056 --> 00:10:38.837]  That they're engineering a worldwide drought.
[00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:46.396]  And it's just admitted they're doing it, and it's just going to continue, because there's nothing these evil people won't do.
[00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:55.785]  I mean, it's John P. Holdren, just search engine his name, and the term geoengineering, and he admits their giant chemtrail program.
[00:10:57.586 --> 00:11:03.332]  Exactly all these years, exactly what we said chemtrails are, they now come out in the Wall Street Journal and say they're good.
[00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.471]  Why here in Austin in particular do you think?
[00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.871]  Because there seems to be rain all around us.
[00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:10.992]  It just doesn't come here.
[00:11:12.352 --> 00:11:18.034]  Well, I mean, out in California you can see when the cloud formation comes in with water, they come in and spray and knock the clouds out.
[00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:19.574]  They've got mixtures that do that.
[00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:22.955]  I mean, they admit they're, quote, manipulating the weather.
[00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:25.396]  They just say the details are classified.
[00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:28.777]  And they have a Congressional Weather Control Bureau.
[00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:31.838]  They have weather weapons treaties with the UN.
[00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:37.823]  And NASA admits that the Earth's 20% darker than it was a few years ago.
[00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:39.044]  And they're just spraying it.
[00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:40.685]  Satellite photos show the trails.
[00:11:41.786 --> 00:11:42.767]  And it's just hellish.
[00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:45.530]  And they're just going to keep spraying and keep spraying and keep spraying.
[00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.853]  Because out of disaster, government gets more power.
[00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:50.694]  They want to bankrupt everything.
[00:11:50.714 --> 00:11:57.060]  They want to destroy any... They're shutting down the farmers, the ranchers, garage sales, people selling eggs.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.182]  They just, they bring total hell and death.
[00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:03.038]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[00:12:03.338 --> 00:12:10.207]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:16.075]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.
[00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:16.515]  We're good.

[00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:01.262]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:13:01.342 --> 00:13:06.123]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:13:06.283 --> 00:13:14.085]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:19.726]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:26.908]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:32.531]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:37.533]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:13:37.873 --> 00:13:45.497]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:48.499]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:52.045]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:53.568]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:53.588 --> 00:13:53.809]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:05.418]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:05.918 --> 00:14:12.907]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:19.675]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:20.095 --> 00:14:21.916]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:24.477]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:14:24.558 --> 00:14:35.563]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:36.144 --> 00:14:37.424]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:39.205]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:45.889]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:54.325]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:55.966]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:56.406 --> 00:14:57.587]  The people strike back!
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.201]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:02.721]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[00:15:03.082 --> 00:15:04.562]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[00:15:04.923 --> 00:15:09.505]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:14.468]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:16.549]  Introducing Choose4Health.

[00:16:08.508 --> 00:16:15.789]  At a meeting in Tennessee this weekend with Bill Clinton, Al Gore said it is a moral authority of Jesus.
[00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:25.492]  You're basically going to hell if you don't pass government health care, that you want people to die on the streets, when really they just want government control of it so they can steal it.
[00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:29.453]  They want another 20% of your paycheck and you'll get an aspirin for a heart attack.
[00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:35.254]  These are eugenicists that openly say they want to drug your food and water in the president's own
[00:16:36.733 --> 00:16:38.573]  Science Czar's textbook.
[00:16:39.814 --> 00:16:47.075]  It's just that they always get people to stand down and go along with tyranny in the name of taking care of people.
[00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:53.236]  Let's go to Tina and then Wilson and then Ingrid.
[00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:54.797]  Tina in Ohio.
[00:16:54.877 --> 00:16:55.937]  Oh, Tina just hung up.
[00:16:56.017 --> 00:16:56.957]  Wilson in Florida.
[00:16:57.237 --> 00:16:58.257]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:16:59.438 --> 00:17:01.258]  Hello, good afternoon, Alex Jones.
[00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:02.638]  It's a pleasure speaking to you.
[00:17:03.118 --> 00:17:04.459]  I just got a quick question.
[00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.199]  I'm curious if I have like a
[00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.011]  What type of filter do you have?
[00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:09.512]  Is it on the faucet?
[00:17:09.532 --> 00:17:12.494]  Or is it like a... I'd have to know the model number.
[00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:16.237]  But what type of filter does it say it is?
[00:17:16.317 --> 00:17:16.617]  Charcoal?
[00:17:37.643 --> 00:17:39.684]  Um, no, one second, I got it right here.
[00:17:39.704 --> 00:17:48.067]  It says pure NSE faucet mounted filtration system.
[00:17:48.107 --> 00:17:50.147]  It doesn't really say anything on it.
[00:17:52.608 --> 00:17:55.749]  Is it a pitcher or does it hook onto the faucet?
[00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.470]  It's hooked onto the faucet.
[00:17:59.586 --> 00:18:01.788]  All filtration is better than nothing.
[00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:03.450]  It stops the dead bacteria.
[00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.993]  See, chlorine only kills the dead bacteria that are in the city water system.
[00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:14.320]  It cuts out just any, even a charcoal filter, depending on the filter, cuts 70, 80, 90 percent.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.441]  It varies with every one.
[00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:23.649]  A lot of those more complex filtration systems, as long as you change them on a regular basis, they reduce everything.
[00:18:24.817 --> 00:18:25.037]  I think?
[00:18:43.317 --> 00:18:43.778]  All right.
[00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:13.182]  Or true water from a spring, and then you've got to check the content of that spring's water.
[00:19:14.683 --> 00:19:19.185]  But see, when you hear fluoride, a lot of natural springs have calcium fluoride.
[00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:20.206]  That's actually good for you.
[00:19:20.866 --> 00:19:31.571]  When you hear the word fluoride, that is a catch-all term for up to 340 plus, but usually over 100, different chemicals that cities dump.
[00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:33.252]  Lead, mercury, arsenic.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.801]  Cyanide, I mean you can't make this up.
[00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:45.523]  What they call fluoride is actually a special toxic waste brewed just to cause brain damage they put in the water.
[00:19:45.783 --> 00:20:01.868]  And I've had the head of the EPA union on, the top scientists, where 90 plus percent of them wrote a letter last year, or was it, no it was in 97 now, or 2007, saying this is deadly poison, this is killing people.
[00:20:03.863 --> 00:20:05.345]  Do not drink the tap water.
[00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:09.230]  The tap water is just absolute hardcore chemical weapon.
[00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.992]  That's why the public is retarded.
[00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:13.695]  I mean, they literally have been under chemical attack.
[00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:17.920]  Alright, and I have one final question.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.806]  I was curious, my uncle was actually curious, how was the swine flu came upon us?
[00:20:24.997 --> 00:20:28.118]  Well, we've had top scientists on, and you can begin search engine it.
[00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.200]  Top virologist says swine flu made in lab.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.601]  And you'll see BBC and other headlines.
[00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:41.624]  And it was clearly, clearly made in a lab.
[00:20:41.664 --> 00:20:44.705]  And then it showed up in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year.
[00:20:45.006 --> 00:20:46.326]  They fear mongered about it.
[00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:50.488]  And regardless, the attempted response to it,
[00:20:51.730 --> 00:21:10.363]  And the level 6.2, now they've made the scale even higher than 6, was the formal height, is all about the UN World Health Organization ordering nation states what to do under treaty, and the UN's bragging, oh this is great for the UN and global governance, global government, because this is how we order everybody to take it.
[00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:14.305]  But we have all these other flu shots killing people in the trials in history.
[00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:16.927]  We have the 76 swine flu killing a bunch of people.
[00:21:17.187 --> 00:21:21.010]  We have internal CDC documents saying, past swine flu
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.551]  A test of killed people.
[00:21:24.072 --> 00:21:27.454]  The bird flu test last year killed a bunch of people in Europe.
[00:21:28.054 --> 00:21:30.356]  So why are they doing this?
[00:21:30.376 --> 00:21:32.317]  Appreciate your call.
[00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:35.639]  Ingrid in Nevada, Gene in Missouri, Ray in Indiana.
[00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.861]  Your calls and a lot more, straight ahead.
[00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:40.262]  On the other side, I'm fired up for liberty.
[00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:43.284]  And my job is to get you fired up for liberty.
[00:21:43.524 --> 00:21:44.725]  To take on the scum.
[00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:46.647]  To stop laying down to this crap.
[00:21:47.027 --> 00:21:48.508]  And to defeat the New World Order.
[00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:53.616]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.556 --> 00:21:57.356]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:02.977]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:03.397 --> 00:22:08.358]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:08.738 --> 00:22:10.459]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:15.600]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.700]  How much do you want?
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.701]  When do you want it?
[00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:19.682]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:19.962 --> 00:22:20.783]  When will you need it?
[00:22:21.043 --> 00:22:23.105]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:24.346]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:25.907]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:26.107 --> 00:22:31.171]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:34.554]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:38.437]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:38.777 --> 00:22:39.758]  How much will you need?
[00:22:39.998 --> 00:22:40.598]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.899 --> 00:22:41.799]  How much do you want?
[00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:42.740]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.781]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:46.783]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:22:47.083 --> 00:22:48.844]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:22:48.864 --> 00:22:49.765]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:59.369 --> 00:23:04.536]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:09.042]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:09.202 --> 00:23:11.065]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:11.485 --> 00:23:12.847]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:13.107 --> 00:23:14.129]  There is a solution.
[00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:22.375]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:36.286 --> 00:23:41.870]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.114]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:24:00.757 --> 00:24:07.599]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:23.785]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:24:24.105 --> 00:24:29.266]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:35.748]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:24:35.988 --> 00:24:39.589]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:42.470]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:47.931]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:24:48.251 --> 00:24:50.854]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:24:50.915 --> 00:24:53.117]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:24:53.137 --> 00:24:55.600]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.886]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:25:15.774 --> 00:25:18.555]  All right, let's try to get some of your calls in a little bit quicker here.
[00:25:18.575 --> 00:25:19.915]  I don't want to do a big news blitz.
[00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:25.877]  I'm going to announce in 10 minutes who's coming up on the show in the final two hours today.
[00:25:28.438 --> 00:25:29.458]  So stay with us for that.
[00:25:29.698 --> 00:25:30.819]  Ingrid in Nevada.
[00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:32.399]  Ingrid, you're on the air.
[00:25:32.439 --> 00:25:32.799]  Welcome.
[00:25:33.879 --> 00:25:34.560]  Hello, Alex.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:45.403]  About five months before the Maya Group vote came out, my friend and me got pulled over in Las Vegas for the Ron Paul and Info Wars stickers, and it happened again.
[00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:46.915]  Last Friday.
[00:25:47.656 --> 00:25:53.579]  And in order to protect ourselves and also support your sponsors, I ordered one of those camera pens.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.362]  But I had it under charge that night because it takes from two to four hours to charge.
[00:26:00.423 --> 00:26:01.463]  And I forgot to bring it.
[00:26:02.424 --> 00:26:04.785]  Anyway, police car behind us.
[00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:08.808]  And then the lights come on.
[00:26:10.288 --> 00:26:11.529]  And he comes to the car.
[00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.931]  And my friend, he just had a haircut a few days ago.
[00:26:15.618 --> 00:26:17.839]  And he says, you're in the military, aren't you?
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.780]  My friend said, no.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.861]  But I was in the Marines.
[00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:23.922]  He says, oh, so you're a veteran.
[00:26:24.943 --> 00:26:26.803]  Then he shines the light in the car.
[00:26:27.664 --> 00:26:30.205]  And my friend has one of those organites.
[00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:32.226]  And he says, what is this?
[00:26:32.926 --> 00:26:34.147]  And he says, that's an organite.
[00:26:34.627 --> 00:26:37.148]  And he says, what is an organite?
[00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:39.449]  This looks like a cell to a bomb.
[00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.531]  I was in shock when he said that.
[00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.491]  And then we explained it to him.
[00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:47.713]  It's against the microwave towers.
[00:26:49.394 --> 00:26:55.077]  And then he ordered my friend out of the car and in the back, in the front of the police car.
[00:26:56.098 --> 00:26:58.820]  So he pulled you over and flipped out over the Ron Paul.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:07.845]  And I don't know if you're the lady in Las Vegas, but there's video of police in a parking lot flipping out over a Ron Paul sticker.
[00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:11.788]  And in South Carolina, they raided people's door and kicked it down.
[00:27:13.068 --> 00:27:20.511]  I mean, because the MIAC report and the DHS report that we broke says you're a terrorist, basically, if you support auditing the Fed.
[00:27:21.212 --> 00:27:24.253]  I guess 75% of Americans in that Gallup poll are terrorists.
[00:27:24.773 --> 00:27:26.574]  And so now he's got you out of the car.
[00:27:27.714 --> 00:27:28.795]  All of this is going on.
[00:27:29.715 --> 00:27:30.676]  Continue with the story.
[00:27:30.696 --> 00:27:33.317]  Did he say it was because of the evil Ron Paul?
[00:27:34.517 --> 00:27:37.299]  No, but it definitely was, because we never got a ticket.
[00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:40.480]  He was behind us for about a minute, and then the lights come on.
[00:27:41.024 --> 00:27:43.445]  We never got a ticket and he didn't tell us.
[00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:44.166]  I understand.
[00:27:44.226 --> 00:27:45.086]  So how did this end?
[00:27:45.146 --> 00:27:45.787]  How did this end?
[00:27:47.027 --> 00:27:50.689]  Well, he wasn't blind and we were terrorists making a bomb with the bit they organized.
[00:27:52.611 --> 00:27:54.992]  Yeah, so these are like a work of art for many people.
[00:27:55.032 --> 00:28:00.915]  For other people, they think it deals with the... It's a rife... In fact, somebody mailed us one.
[00:28:00.935 --> 00:28:04.998]  Will somebody go grab me that out of the back office, the Oregon generator?
[00:28:05.318 --> 00:28:06.698]  I mean, they're pretty neat little things.
[00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:07.239]  I don't really...
[00:28:08.511 --> 00:28:10.512]  Yeah, and he thought it was a sell to make a bomb.
[00:28:10.933 --> 00:28:11.733]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:28:11.753 --> 00:28:12.694]  Well, look, look, look, look.
[00:28:13.014 --> 00:28:19.257]  The new thing is cops come up, the bad ones, and they say, your camera is a gun, your bag is a bomb.
[00:28:19.337 --> 00:28:21.319]  We know it's not, but we're going to charge you with it.
[00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:25.741]  That's in Truth Rising, my film, happened to Luke Radowsky, and we are a change in New York.
[00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:27.462]  So, so how did this end?
[00:28:27.522 --> 00:28:32.325]  He says, he says, okay, you're obviously Al Qaeda, what happens next?
[00:28:33.922 --> 00:28:39.066]  Well, he questioned my friend in the back of the police car, and then he goes and faces the other way.
[00:28:39.807 --> 00:28:45.212]  Then he comes back to the car where I was, and he says, now tell me, what is this for?
[00:28:45.472 --> 00:28:48.034]  Is this a cell to make a bomb?
[00:28:48.615 --> 00:28:49.856]  So I explained it to him again.
[00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:51.617]  No, it's an organizer.
[00:28:51.837 --> 00:28:54.240]  It's against the energy of the cell phone towers.
[00:28:57.083 --> 00:29:01.588]  He didn't really believe me, but he looked like a rookie that just came out of the police training.
[00:29:01.709 --> 00:29:06.574]  Yeah, we have this Quantico FBI training video and I've been so busy I haven't played it, but you know what?
[00:29:06.594 --> 00:29:07.255]  I'm going to play it tomorrow.
[00:29:07.275 --> 00:29:09.918]  I'm going to play it unedited in its entirety tomorrow.
[00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:12.501]  We'll do that in the third hour tomorrow.
[00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:14.463]  In fact, make a note for Aaron.
[00:29:15.084 --> 00:29:17.326]  I'm just going to air the 14 minute FBI training video.
[00:29:18.007 --> 00:29:20.649]  And they are teaching them, everyone is a terrorist.
[00:29:20.749 --> 00:29:22.630]  I mean, there are terrorists everywhere.
[00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:29.213]  And of course, really, the government staged the terror attacks, and that's been declassified, many of the staged terror attacks in the past.
[00:29:29.233 --> 00:29:29.913]  Yep, here it is.
[00:29:29.973 --> 00:29:33.775]  So, this is the, I guess, the evil thing.
[00:29:34.256 --> 00:29:36.897]  And, to be honest, it does have metal shavings in it.
[00:29:37.197 --> 00:29:43.541]  The more I think about it, this does almost look like a shape-charge weapon, like you'd put plastic behind this,
[00:29:45.262 --> 00:29:47.523]  But no, that's not what they are.
[00:29:48.084 --> 00:29:53.728]  But he definitely then, if he didn't give you a ticket, pulled you over the Ron Paul thing, and then he saw this.
[00:29:54.429 --> 00:29:58.972]  And so, the more I think about it, I mean, it's got metal shavings in it.
[00:29:59.412 --> 00:30:01.914]  I never even thought about that, Alex.
[00:30:01.994 --> 00:30:04.476]  That's crazy.
[00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.878]  I was in shock, yeah.
[00:30:06.918 --> 00:30:11.921]  Yeah, but the point is, the point is, I've seen him, it's in Road to Tyranny with
[00:30:14.209 --> 00:30:27.359]  Pharoah Montgomery gets pulled over, they just taser him for no reason, let the dog attack him, he's got his hands up, and they get on the news with jumper cables and go, look, instead of going, look, sir, droids, they go, look, sir, pipe bombs!
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.564]  And then they had to let him go later, but they've got to, look, they're out of control.
[00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:35.746]  They're teaching them Al-Qaeda's everywhere, so they're going to see Al-Qaeda.
[00:30:36.647 --> 00:30:37.848]  But I'm sorry, how did this end?
[00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:45.682]  He thought he had cut out my friend, implying he's in the military and he's a terrorist.
[00:30:45.722 --> 00:30:48.043]  He finally let us go, but no ticket, like I said.
[00:30:48.143 --> 00:30:50.944]  It definitely was for the Ron Paul sticker.
[00:30:50.964 --> 00:30:53.345]  Well, when you see this, it's definitely for the Ron Paul sticker.
[00:30:53.705 --> 00:30:54.646]  Did you ask him about that?
[00:30:55.683 --> 00:31:01.428]  No, my friend, don't make me shut up, because... Well, I guarantee you, you've been put in the database now.
[00:31:01.748 --> 00:31:05.171]  When you see the FBI training manual, it says, woman has a camera?
[00:31:05.571 --> 00:31:06.071]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:31:06.412 --> 00:31:07.632]  Put her in the crime database.
[00:31:07.652 --> 00:31:08.513]  She's now Al-Qaeda.
[00:31:09.454 --> 00:31:21.804]  And so it's all about a chilling effect where there's no judge, no jury, can't own firearms anymore when you're put on the secret list, can't have jobs, they're openly announcing, just total tyranny, just big armored government buildings that
[00:31:22.324 --> 00:31:35.913]  Control the country through these tracking grids and then they just turn your life off and you try to make money with a garage sale after they've turned your national ID card off, the SWAT team pulls up and gets out and goes, you don't sell stuff in America!
[00:31:37.174 --> 00:31:39.035]  Take them away to the re-education camp!
[00:31:39.996 --> 00:31:41.477]  This ain't America anymore!
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.721]  Cue up the bureaucrats saying it isn't America anymore.
[00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:46.422]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[00:31:46.802 --> 00:31:51.425]  And believe me, that's what happens when they first start getting rid of free speech in the Second Amendment.
[00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:54.386]  Any right, it immediately goes downhill.
[00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:58.068]  It's like you start cresting, like a water slide.
[00:31:58.088 --> 00:32:00.209]  Like if you go to Slitter Bonner, some water park.
[00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:04.732]  Right at first you're going slow, and then... And we're already sliding.
[00:32:05.872 --> 00:32:08.133]  And now it's just now starting to speed up.
[00:32:08.174 --> 00:32:10.575]  We're like... And it's going to go...
[00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:16.225]  And it's just gonna be just stealing and grabbing and, ah, it's ours now!
[00:32:16.365 --> 00:32:16.986]  Everything!
[00:32:17.246 --> 00:32:18.247]  Oh God, we love it!
[00:32:18.548 --> 00:32:19.308]  We're scum!
[00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:20.109]  We're filth!
[00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:21.991]  We can't produce anything but we can steal!
[00:32:22.011 --> 00:32:28.879]  And I realized all the thuggism, all the militarized police, all of it, they're the real class.
[00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:31.301]  They're the upper class.
[00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.763]  We're the lower class.
[00:32:34.688 --> 00:32:43.157]  And you get a uniform, you get a badge, you get a government bureaucracy, you become a code enforcer, you become a CPS worker, you're now a god.
[00:32:44.318 --> 00:32:57.091]  And everyone, because I was in the, flew out to LA last week again to take care of very important projects we're working on, not just the Jesse Ventura TV show that I'm now a consultant officially on and also going to be part of multiple episodes.
[00:32:58.183 --> 00:33:00.304]  I'm just going to probably all of them, but I'll just leave it at that.
[00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:17.072]  And then part of the next show that gets picked up, but side issue, and I was doing some other stuff out in LA that we'll reveal next week, but the point is that leaving Austin, TSA big fans again.
[00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:20.926]  Oh, my friend in Bastrop just loves you.
[00:33:20.946 --> 00:33:22.247]  Oh, my husband just loves you.
[00:33:22.728 --> 00:33:25.590]  Other TSA guys going, yeah, I know who you are, smiling at me.
[00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.652]  Hey, we're not that bad going through.
[00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.893]  You know, hope we don't scare you.
[00:33:30.494 --> 00:33:33.837]  But when I got to L.A., this was, I've gone to L.A.
[00:33:33.877 --> 00:33:37.360]  and flown back now six times.
[00:33:39.061 --> 00:33:41.323]  My sixth time leaving, the L.A.
[00:33:41.363 --> 00:33:42.364]  guards weren't fans.
[00:33:43.513 --> 00:33:49.077]  Now they got a little too over the top, training everybody to be slaves and bossing you around, so people kind of rebelled against it.
[00:33:49.337 --> 00:33:54.460]  So now they act a little more friendly, and TSA admits they've been told to do that, because now they're going nationwide on the streets of America.
[00:33:54.941 --> 00:34:04.347]  But I did watch TSA in like the bathroom, coming in, like shoving people, like, get out of my way, you know, just like real body language of... because, you know, it's a crowded bathroom in there at the urinals.
[00:34:05.885 --> 00:34:14.772]  And I watched him at restaurants and things, people like scared and them going, and you're some guy, you go get paid 12, 14 bucks an hour and suddenly everybody's scared of you.
[00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:20.297]  And see, this is the new class system, government and national security and their bureaucracies.
[00:34:20.657 --> 00:34:23.780]  They're just turning the whole economy into their system.
[00:34:27.823 --> 00:34:31.946]  We're going to go to Gene and Ray and Anti-Federalist and Andrew and Pat in a moment.
[00:34:31.966 --> 00:34:33.347]  I want to go ahead and make that announcement.
[00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:36.663]  This is the maiden voyage of the trailer.
[00:34:37.264 --> 00:34:43.089]  This is an InfoWars-centric trailer, though I would say I'm the main... There's a lot of other great people in this film.
[00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:44.871]  Let me just stop there.
[00:34:45.452 --> 00:34:46.853]  Let me just calmly explain this to you.
[00:34:50.116 --> 00:34:51.077]  Drumroll, please.
[00:34:54.130 --> 00:35:00.551]  William Lewis has made a film about the history of FEMA camps, the current FEMA camp facility.
[00:35:00.891 --> 00:35:02.552]  He got tours of FEMA camps.
[00:35:03.472 --> 00:35:08.053]  He has made a film that I wanted to make, but I've been focused on other big issues.
[00:35:09.413 --> 00:35:10.313]  And I'm glad he made it.
[00:35:10.453 --> 00:35:18.595]  And so when they asked me to be an advisor on it, and they asked me to be the main voice in the film, I was very honored to be part of it.
[00:35:18.635 --> 00:35:20.795]  It's got a lot of other great people in it as well.
[00:35:22.213 --> 00:35:23.614]  Comes off very well.
[00:35:24.534 --> 00:35:27.496]  Comes off very mainstream, but also devastating.
[00:35:27.956 --> 00:35:31.118]  And it covers all the real FEMA camp info.
[00:35:31.138 --> 00:35:32.678]  The rumors are over.
[00:35:32.818 --> 00:35:33.319]  It's proven.
[00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:36.740]  We have a similar, in a month or so, coming out.
[00:35:37.121 --> 00:35:37.901]  But I can't wait anymore.
[00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:38.842]  We were going to have it out earlier.
[00:35:39.442 --> 00:35:39.742]  Just so.
[00:35:39.782 --> 00:35:40.682]  I'm just going to promote this one.
[00:35:40.943 --> 00:35:41.823]  This one's great.
[00:35:43.964 --> 00:35:45.105]  We're putting out an addendum.
[00:35:45.605 --> 00:35:49.707]  But regardless, it's just a video presentation.
[00:35:49.827 --> 00:35:51.188]  This is an amazing film.
[00:35:53.147 --> 00:35:54.947]  And it's called Camp FEMA.
[00:35:55.008 --> 00:35:57.748]  And it's going straight to DVD.
[00:35:58.168 --> 00:35:59.409]  You can pre-order it now.
[00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:02.889]  And it comes out in just a couple weeks.
[00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.510]  So the DVDs are being shipped to me right now.
[00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.411]  You can order it anywhere else right now.
[00:36:08.451 --> 00:36:09.331]  It's just now coming out.
[00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:10.471]  I'm a consultant.
[00:36:10.491 --> 00:36:11.552]  I'm a major part of the film.
[00:36:11.572 --> 00:36:13.512]  We're going to play this trailer in a moment.
[00:36:13.812 --> 00:36:21.494]  William Lewis was already a great filmmaker of a whole bunch of different documentaries.
[00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:34.410]  Like America Under Siege, and Washington You're Fired, and the bubble about what's happening with the economy.
[00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:42.476]  But this film is extremely powerful and extremely informative.
[00:36:43.116 --> 00:36:47.260]  And I want everybody to start their engines.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.882]  I want everybody to get ready
[00:36:52.233 --> 00:36:59.459]  For the day you get this DVD in your hands to have viewing parties, to show it to everybody you know, to educate everybody around you.
[00:36:59.499 --> 00:37:02.261]  This is not my film, but I'm a major part of it.
[00:37:02.681 --> 00:37:04.002]  It's got my seal of approval.
[00:37:04.042 --> 00:37:05.483]  The information is impeccable.
[00:37:05.504 --> 00:37:09.867]  It was also Gary Franchi produced it, directed by William Lewis.
[00:37:10.888 --> 00:37:14.310]  And William's with us for two hours to play a few select clips of the film.
[00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:20.334]  We've got some of the DVDs here already so we can play some clips and to talk about it and to take your calls.
[00:37:20.394 --> 00:37:23.696]  But this is the proof of the Gulag Archipelago.
[00:37:24.076 --> 00:37:25.917]  And by exposing this, we can defeat them.
[00:37:25.957 --> 00:37:26.918]  People will know the game plan.
[00:37:26.938 --> 00:37:29.100]  So you can now order it right now.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.681]  It starts shipping in two weeks.
[00:37:32.422 --> 00:37:34.603]  So start your engines.
[00:37:34.723 --> 00:37:36.725]  Get the orders in today.
[00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:41.008]  And I would add, while you're getting Camp FEMA, another film
[00:37:42.717 --> 00:37:53.083]  That I think is good for beginners, and the cinematography's great, and it aired on the Independent Film Channel, but it's got hours of extras on it that are extremely powerful.
[00:37:53.483 --> 00:37:55.424]  New World Order, what do you believe?
[00:37:56.525 --> 00:38:01.468]  An intriguing, even-handed peek into the world all around us that we never really see.
[00:38:01.588 --> 00:38:03.149]  Film Threat said that.
[00:38:03.269 --> 00:38:07.011]  Twitch said skillfully assembled and surprisingly absorbing.
[00:38:07.431 --> 00:38:08.832]  Wired Magazine said
[00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:16.895]  Meyer and Neal set out to make an even-handed documentary that lets Jones and his people speak for themselves, and they've succeeded.
[00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:18.016]  LA Times.
[00:38:18.136 --> 00:38:19.998]  Unexpectedly affecting.
[00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.159]  Ain't it cool news?
[00:38:22.219 --> 00:38:24.321]  A documentary in the purest sense of the word.
[00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:25.802]  Fantastic.
[00:38:26.823 --> 00:38:28.824]  Now again, I did a little consulting on this film.
[00:38:28.844 --> 00:38:31.887]  I'm the main character, along with Luke Radowsky and many other great people.
[00:38:33.174 --> 00:38:39.199]  First time available, discounted, out of the gates, New World Order, now available on DVD, and we have it discounted.
[00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:50.610]  This is shipping right now, but if you want to order it and wait a few weeks and get it comboed and save $5, you can get it with the new Camp FEMA film by William Lewis.
[00:38:52.662 --> 00:38:58.529]  And again, what I want is for people to go behind the curtain to see this film.
[00:38:58.549 --> 00:39:03.575]  I think it has a great perspective overall and is an important documentary for people on the fence.
[00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:04.902]  Get it.
[00:39:05.283 --> 00:39:05.983]  Show it to people.
[00:39:06.123 --> 00:39:06.784]  New World Order.
[00:39:07.224 --> 00:39:07.685]  Available.
[00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:08.886]  Out of the gates.
[00:39:09.286 --> 00:39:10.607]  That's my mug.
[00:39:10.627 --> 00:39:13.189]  That's me 40 pounds heavier there on the cover.
[00:39:13.209 --> 00:39:14.951]  It's also a little history for you.
[00:39:16.032 --> 00:39:18.133]  So, right there available.
[00:39:18.173 --> 00:39:22.297]  The New World Order and Camp FEMA available right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:28.062]  Let's go ahead though and play the trailer for Camp FEMA by William Lewis.
[00:39:29.303 --> 00:39:30.224]  William's such a great guy.
[00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:31.625]  He's got his own trailer coming out soon.
[00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.891]  When he comes on, we'll play his earlier trailer, but he's got an official trailer coming out soon.
[00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:41.372]  This is our quick trailer we put together because we're so excited about his film.
[00:39:42.273 --> 00:39:47.834]  So this is the Infowars trailer, because again, I'm a consultant on the film and the main voice.
[00:39:48.034 --> 00:39:52.336]  There's other great voices in it as well that look really sharp and come across really well.
[00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:56.277]  In fact, we'll go through a whole list of those people that are in it when he
[00:39:57.628 --> 00:40:00.012]  When he comes up and joins us coming up.
[00:40:00.493 --> 00:40:04.640]  Let's go ahead and play the trailer for Camp FEMA available at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:40:04.761 --> 00:40:07.966]  World premiere of this trailer right here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:19.127 --> 00:40:22.571]  The elites have said that they want to have a final revolution.
[00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:25.674]  That they know the public's going to revolt against them.
[00:40:25.854 --> 00:40:30.319]  So that's why they've scientifically set up the surveillance grid, the cashless society.
[00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:34.703]  This whole continuity of government system is designed to suppress and control people.
[00:40:34.723 --> 00:40:35.084]  You know what?
[00:40:35.124 --> 00:40:35.484]  Hit pause.
[00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:37.126]  I wasn't watching.
[00:40:39.434 --> 00:40:40.855]  The clock, like I normally do.
[00:40:41.175 --> 00:40:42.677]  I got so engrossed talking about it.
[00:40:42.697 --> 00:40:44.638]  We'll come back and play the trailer after the break.
[00:40:44.658 --> 00:40:45.839]  This is a four and a half minute trailer.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.264]  It is now up on the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube and it just went live at InfoWars.com.
[00:40:51.544 --> 00:40:59.670]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber, you're not watching the live slash radio show right now.
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:06.136]  Man, I was out in LA for three days last week and where I was at in Beverly Hills, the house I was at,
[00:41:07.219 --> 00:41:14.624]  Had ashes coming down all over the cars and outside on the patio furniture by the pool.
[00:41:16.466 --> 00:41:19.368]  And they were talking about making people have trouble breathing.
[00:41:19.388 --> 00:41:23.550]  And now it's just burning all over the place.
[00:41:25.392 --> 00:41:29.675]  Mandatory evacuation for 6,000 plus homes right up to where I was staying.
[00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:31.256]  I don't know that happens to my friend's house.
[00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:34.750]  And it was just crazy.
[00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:37.151]  So that's why I keep hacking and coughing and pausing.
[00:41:37.171 --> 00:41:39.532]  I need a glass of water or something.
[00:41:41.073 --> 00:41:46.335]  Because for three days, it was like, I mean, it was just, it was like hell or something.
[00:41:46.615 --> 00:41:53.358]  When I was flying in Wednesday morning, the captain's like, look out the plane and you can just see the fires and just burning mountains.
[00:41:54.878 --> 00:41:59.180]  Because what happens is every year when the, when it gets dry and the winds kick up, these arsonists go out.
[00:42:00.424 --> 00:42:04.027]  And they set fires, especially in wealthy areas, because they hate, I guess, the wealthy.
[00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:07.550]  It's like their war against Hollywood or whatever.
[00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.992]  And so fires start everywhere.
[00:42:10.392 --> 00:42:16.757]  I'm flying into L.A., looking out the window, because I had a window seat, and I even took some photos.
[00:42:16.797 --> 00:42:19.159]  We ought to take these off my iPhone and upload them to InfoWars.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.263]  And there was just burning everywhere, and just smoke over the city.
[00:42:25.572 --> 00:42:29.255]  When we got on the plane to take off in Austin, they said weather forecast in L.A.
[00:42:29.275 --> 00:42:31.437]  76 degrees and smoky.
[00:42:32.298 --> 00:42:37.703]  And boy, when we flew into that smoke... Anyways, I've been in a... basically living in a chimney for three days.
[00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:40.986]  It just fried my lungs, man.
[00:42:42.007 --> 00:42:47.011]  Then I go for these morning jogs and... I was like high the three days I was there.
[00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.032]  I was high on the smoke.
[00:42:48.152 --> 00:42:50.914]  I was like nauseous and stumbling around.
[00:42:50.954 --> 00:42:51.535]  I mean, L.A.
[00:42:51.595 --> 00:42:52.556]  is like hell or something.
[00:42:54.394 --> 00:42:56.733]  We'll be right back with the Camp FEMA trailer.
[00:42:56.753 --> 00:42:57.156]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.692 --> 00:43:04.435]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.
[00:43:04.555 --> 00:43:21.586]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222, and trihalomethanes.
[00:43:21.866 --> 00:43:26.529]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.
[00:43:26.949 --> 00:43:33.694]  As an authorized dealer for over four years serving thousands of satisfied customers, we offer amazing specials for Berkey Light water systems.
[00:43:34.094 --> 00:43:42.020]  Order the Berkey Light system today and we'll include two black Berkey elements and three sport Berkey water bottles for only two hundred and nine dollars with free shipping.
[00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:42.761]  That's right.
[00:43:42.941 --> 00:43:48.145]  Free shipping and three sport Berkey water bottles and eighty nine dollar value free for a limited time.
[00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:50.088]  Just call the Berkey guy at 877-886-3653 now to order.
[00:43:50.108 --> 00:43:52.832]  That's the Berkey guy at 877-886-3653 or visit our website at directed21.com.
[00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.591]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:44:07.651 --> 00:44:08.792]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.453]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[00:44:10.533 --> 00:44:13.375]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:44:13.415 --> 00:44:17.637]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:44:17.677 --> 00:44:26.403]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:44:26.703 --> 00:44:31.566]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:44:35.362 --> 00:44:36.442]  How dare you?
[00:44:37.803 --> 00:44:42.864]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:44:42.884 --> 00:44:45.185]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:44:45.225 --> 00:44:52.207]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[00:44:52.227 --> 00:44:54.828]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:44:55.088 --> 00:44:57.088]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:44:57.328 --> 00:44:59.809]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:45:01.045 --> 00:45:06.510]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:07.070]  and the world.
[00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.793]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:45:11.213 --> 00:45:17.439]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:45:17.719 --> 00:45:19.500]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:27.687]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:45:27.947 --> 00:45:32.392]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:45:32.672 --> 00:45:38.198]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:45:38.478 --> 00:45:40.480]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.903]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:45:43.243 --> 00:45:44.024]  Free of charge.

[00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:53.570]  Factory direct.

[00:45:56.813 --> 00:46:07.760]  Okay, we're going to go right into the Camp FEMA trailer.
[00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:10.803]  Infowars.com exclusive.
[00:46:11.363 --> 00:46:12.424]  Right now, here it is.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.381]  Coming to the Info War, September 18, 2009.
[00:46:23.762 --> 00:46:27.224]  The elites have said that they want to have a final revolution.
[00:46:27.704 --> 00:46:30.325]  That they know the public's going to revolt against them.
[00:46:30.505 --> 00:46:34.966]  So that's why they've scientifically set up the surveillance grid, the cashless society.
[00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:40.968]  This whole continuity of government system is designed to suppress and control the people of America.
[00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:45.849]  My name is Sam Ozaki.
[00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:50.211]  I'm a native-born American citizen, Los Angeles, California.
[00:46:52.572 --> 00:47:03.875]  When Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, we were all rounded up like cattle and placed into America's concentration camps.
[00:47:04.735 --> 00:47:09.017]  In May 2007, President Bush signed the National Security Presidential Directive 51.
[00:47:09.917 --> 00:47:12.698]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent
[00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:18.153]  To have a plan to provide for the continuity of government, they have such a plan.
[00:47:18.593 --> 00:47:26.116]  They introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate, but they said, don't worry, there's a detailed classified version.
[00:47:26.576 --> 00:47:27.537]  Army Regulation 210-35.
[00:47:27.597 --> 00:47:28.857]  Now, this was set up in 1986 secretly.
[00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:38.347]  And for 10 plus years, it was secret.
[00:47:39.088 --> 00:47:45.973]  And in 1997, Bill Clinton declassified this, and we were the first major radio show to cover it.
[00:47:46.434 --> 00:47:47.695]  Since then, it's been expanded.
[00:47:47.955 --> 00:47:58.143]  This lists 12 camps to hold American citizens that have been built by the United States Army.
[00:48:00.037 --> 00:48:05.482]  Beginning in October, the Army plans to station an active unit inside the United States.
[00:48:06.082 --> 00:48:12.968]  Under NORTHCOM and under the new Homeland Brigade, it was first going to be 3,000, and then 20,000, and then 40,000.
[00:48:13.408 --> 00:48:19.673]  The 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq.
[00:48:19.933 --> 00:48:24.898]  Combat hardened troops who've been running camps and centers in Iraq.
[00:48:25.558 --> 00:48:30.163]  ...are now coming back to the United States to quote, carry out law enforcement actions.
[00:48:30.183 --> 00:48:35.269]  The Army unit may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control.
[00:48:35.669 --> 00:48:41.396]  The primary purpose of this force is to provide help to people in need in the aftermath of a WMD-like event in the homeland.
[00:48:41.696 --> 00:48:48.797]  Why is the media on one hand saying there are no FEMA camps, but on the other hand, legislation has been introduced to build them?
[00:48:48.957 --> 00:48:56.099]  Here's HR 645 legalizing what has already been developed, what's already been paid for by FEMA.
[00:48:56.679 --> 00:49:03.960]  The government doesn't build things that are not needed, or that there aren't contingency plans that say there's a reason for them.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:09.641]  These are the kinds of camps that could be used for political dissidents, just like occurred in Nazi Germany.
[00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:17.475]  I think the government's anticipating that there's going to be an increased reaction against the economic downturn.
[00:49:18.036 --> 00:49:22.799]  All of our rights are predicated on a free America.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.603]  And if we don't have a free America, all of the other questions become moot.
[00:49:28.243 --> 00:49:35.669]  Don't these companies have a responsibility, morally, if they're in there building camps and building shackles and building barbed wire facing in to speak out?
[00:49:36.429 --> 00:49:46.136]  I talked to the Department of Homeland Security spokespeople and they affirmed the contract with this KBR, the former Halliburton company, was in place.
[00:49:46.156 --> 00:49:58.906]  The Department of Homeland Security was ready to build these contingency, as needed, detention centers anywhere in the country in the event of any kind of a national emergency, including natural disasters or, again, riots or protests.
[00:50:00.578 --> 00:50:06.760]  The real terrorists are the people that have hijacked our nation that would dare say the First Amendment is terrorism.
[00:50:14.683 --> 00:50:16.604]  September 18th, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:16.624 --> 00:50:19.065]  A little more than two weeks from now.
[00:50:20.814 --> 00:50:21.615]  This will ship out.
[00:50:21.635 --> 00:50:29.480]  In fact, I've been given authorization a couple days before September 18th to start shipping these out so people start getting it in or around September 18th.
[00:50:29.941 --> 00:50:37.406]  Get your order in today at InfoWars.com or Camp FEMA and the new film, New World Order.
[00:50:37.787 --> 00:50:38.827]  Stay with us.
[00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.031]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:44.912 --> 00:50:47.214]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.687 --> 00:50:53.670]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:55.712]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:50:55.932 --> 00:51:04.220]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.664]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:51:10.004 --> 00:51:11.626]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:51:11.846 --> 00:51:18.188]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:51:18.368 --> 00:51:29.110]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:29.930]  That's right.
[00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:32.491]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:34.312]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:51:36.272 --> 00:51:36.732]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:06.977]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:07.718 --> 00:52:08.819]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.301]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:11.942]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:16.287]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.807 --> 00:52:20.852]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:22.253 --> 00:52:26.477]  We've got William Lewis, the filmmaker of Camp FEMA, did a great job.
[00:52:26.497 --> 00:52:28.019]  We have the film here.
[00:52:28.039 --> 00:52:30.341]  I'm going to ask him what a few clips are he thinks we should play.
[00:52:31.562 --> 00:52:33.544]  Audio for the radio, video for the video listeners.
[00:52:33.585 --> 00:52:36.828]  Kind of a first sneak peek as well, not just the trailer you just saw.
[00:52:37.308 --> 00:52:39.330]  Coming up, last hour, William...
[00:52:41.305 --> 00:52:45.469]  Lewis will continue to be with us with Gary Franchi, the producer of Camp FEMA.
[00:52:45.909 --> 00:53:07.908]  We'll tell you all about the film, and they're really experts on FEMA camps, so am I. So we'll take your questions on FEMA camps, on the police state, on the cashless society control grid, tie it into the no-buy list for gun owners, tie it into the no-fly list, the shutting down of garage sales, the feds going after eBay, this total control of the economy.
[00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:10.008]  That's all coming up.
[00:53:10.408 --> 00:53:13.550]  Right now, let's go to Jean, Anti-Federalist Andrew, Pat, Wayne, and others.
[00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:14.850]  Jean, you're on the air.
[00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.511]  Thanks for holding.
[00:53:16.391 --> 00:53:16.852]  Okay.
[00:53:17.172 --> 00:53:24.836]  What I want to mention is on September 25th and 26th, there's a meeting of the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:53:26.357 --> 00:53:30.540]  And they're saying no, no, no semi-automatic rifles allowed in the city at that time.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.242]  In fact, that's in my stack, but print assault weapons ban for G20.
[00:53:34.582 --> 00:53:35.402]  I want to cover that.
[00:53:35.583 --> 00:53:36.063]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[00:53:36.758 --> 00:53:53.666]  Yeah, on Truthdig.org, there's a big story about it, but the other thing I want to mention, her name is Naomi Wolf, has done a very good, it was earlier than your material, but she details the 10th
[00:53:55.103 --> 00:54:00.387]  Which a government will use to go from democracy to a fascist state.
[00:54:00.687 --> 00:54:03.289]  Yeah, we've had her on and she's been critical of Obama now.
[00:54:03.689 --> 00:54:04.770]  She's a Rhodes Scholar.
[00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:07.612]  And she goes over the 10 steps.
[00:54:07.652 --> 00:54:09.374]  Yes, and it's all exactly what's happening.
[00:54:10.634 --> 00:54:20.462]  Yeah, and I think that this G20 meeting on the 25th and 26th of September in Pittsburgh may be the event that they're all getting geared up for.
[00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:27.631]  Well, we're going to get guest on about the G20 Assault Weapons Ban, which is all semi-automatic handguns and rifles.
[00:54:27.651 --> 00:54:33.396]  And what they do is, see, for special events they say you don't have your rights, then they expand it out to everything.
[00:54:34.097 --> 00:54:34.937]  Anything else, Jean?
[00:54:36.419 --> 00:54:44.466]  No, I'm just thinking of going there, but I'm looking at this picture of the paramilitary being there, and I'm wondering if I'm going to get
[00:54:45.313 --> 00:54:47.194]  Yeah, well that's part of the intimidation.
[00:54:47.254 --> 00:54:56.198]  That's why they hire provocateurs to attack the police so they can rubber bullet the whole innocent crowd to then scare everybody into not going to political events.
[00:54:56.678 --> 00:54:58.819]  They've been caught in Denver last year.
[00:54:58.839 --> 00:55:00.360]  It's in the Obama Deception Extras.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.721]  Admitted, the police attacked their own cops.
[00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:07.743]  They were caught in Canada a year and a half ago at the North American Union Summit.
[00:55:07.983 --> 00:55:09.083]  Police attacking police.
[00:55:09.344 --> 00:55:12.205]  These are hardcore criminals and they never get in trouble for it.
[00:55:12.545 --> 00:55:13.685]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[00:55:13.705 --> 00:55:14.346]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:19.330]  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, assault weapon ban for G20 Summit.
[00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:23.632]  Gun debate springs from city proposal to control protesters.
[00:55:24.612 --> 00:55:29.235]  Of course, concealed carry people are everywhere with guns, which is even more dangerous, but they don't care.
[00:55:29.515 --> 00:55:32.436]  They don't want to see people with guns out in the open.
[00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:38.039]  Because that breaks the spell that guns are illegal.
[00:55:39.622 --> 00:55:44.765]  See they run these ads and billboards saying report illegal guns and all the shows are based in New York or Chicago.
[00:55:44.825 --> 00:55:48.486]  The dramas where a cop finds a gun in somebody's house and takes them to jail for it.
[00:55:48.827 --> 00:55:52.768]  Weak-minded people see that and think guns are illegal in Arizona and Texas.
[00:55:54.449 --> 00:55:57.511]  When they're only illegal in DC and New York and Chicago.
[00:56:01.493 --> 00:56:05.575]  Pittsburgh short-lived ban on assault weapons quashed by Attorney General
[00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:13.496]  The General Assembly of 94 is still in the city's books and it may get new life under legislation driven by the next month's G20 Summit.
[00:56:13.956 --> 00:56:24.584]  A little notice clause in the proposed ordinance written by Mayor Luke Ravenstahl's administration to keep protesters from thwarting police crowd control efforts invokes the default assault weapons ban.
[00:56:25.085 --> 00:56:31.430]  The clause says no person shall possess an array of items including 37 contraband weapons listed on the ban.
[00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:32.211]  So see,
[00:56:33.459 --> 00:56:35.862]  This has been thrown out before, but they're criminals, they don't care.
[00:56:36.302 --> 00:56:43.051]  For the purpose of defeating lawful removal by police.
[00:56:46.215 --> 00:56:47.676]  It's effect is a matter of debate.
[00:56:48.692 --> 00:56:53.035]  So, again, under national or local emergencies, they say you don't have a right to your guns.
[00:56:53.655 --> 00:56:58.858]  Because they're tyrant scum working for offshore banks, raping us out of existence.
[00:56:59.558 --> 00:57:00.679]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:02.740]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.561]  Well, you should.
[00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:08.163]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:57:08.404 --> 00:57:08.864]  That's right.
[00:57:09.224 --> 00:57:19.109]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:57:19.229 --> 00:57:26.213]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:57:26.573 --> 00:57:33.096]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:57:33.456 --> 00:57:38.659]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:57:38.979 --> 00:57:40.120]  This is real.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.181]  Don't miss out.
[00:57:41.481 --> 00:57:49.866]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[00:57:50.046 --> 00:57:52.228]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:57:52.428 --> 00:57:55.930]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:57:56.111 --> 00:57:59.033]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:57:59.853 --> 00:58:04.878]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:58:05.078 --> 00:58:08.882]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:09.102 --> 00:58:14.708]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:15.008 --> 00:58:19.873]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:20.073 --> 00:58:20.574]  Number three,
[00:58:20.974 --> 00:58:26.420]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:58:27.281 --> 00:58:29.924]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:58:30.164 --> 00:58:34.389]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:34.689 --> 00:58:38.313]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:58:38.533 --> 00:58:44.038]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:58:44.258 --> 00:58:48.822]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:48.962 --> 00:58:50.504]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:00.199 --> 00:59:02.801]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:03.222 --> 00:59:08.166]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:08.546 --> 00:59:10.288]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:10.588 --> 00:59:15.413]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:16.554]  How much do you want?
[00:59:16.774 --> 00:59:17.535]  When do you want it?
[00:59:17.915 --> 00:59:19.496]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:19.797 --> 00:59:20.617]  When will you need it?
[00:59:20.858 --> 00:59:22.919]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:24.180]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:24.401 --> 00:59:25.722]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:25.922 --> 00:59:30.989]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:31.189 --> 00:59:34.414]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:34.774 --> 00:59:38.279]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:38.599 --> 00:59:39.581]  How much will you need?
[00:59:39.821 --> 00:59:40.442]  We don't know.
[00:59:40.722 --> 00:59:41.643]  How much do you want?
[00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:42.565]  All you can get.
[00:59:42.765 --> 00:59:43.546]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.826 --> 00:59:46.607]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:46.888 --> 00:59:49.089]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:49.129 --> 00:59:50.149]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:50.189 --> 00:59:53.131]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.824 --> 01:00:18.887]  Well, he's produced five or six big films I can think of that have had incalculable effect out there on the web, like America Under Siege.
[01:00:20.588 --> 01:00:21.988]  The list just goes on and on.
[01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:26.510]  In Plain Sight.
[01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.230]  Beyond Treason.
[01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.211]  Washington, You're Fired.
[01:00:31.554 --> 01:00:36.496]  His film about the big bubble, about the economy, we sell that at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:36.876 --> 01:00:45.658]  But up on screen at InfoWars.com, we have a headline article, William Lewis' Camp FEMA, now available at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:45.698 --> 01:00:51.280]  And I'm telling you, this is William Lewis' most powerful, hard-hitting film.
[01:00:52.259 --> 01:00:54.020]  And it, I consulted on it.
[01:00:54.661 --> 01:00:55.922]  As you notice, it says featuring.
[01:00:55.942 --> 01:00:58.944]  I'm the first person featured, which I'm proud to be featured in this.
[01:00:59.445 --> 01:01:04.789]  Going over all the facts, going over the evidence, the real camps, the congressional record, where they are.
[01:01:05.149 --> 01:01:08.872]  Not all the government's straw men are fake camps, they go point out.
[01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:12.595]  Alex Jones, John Stettmiller, Catherine,
[01:01:14.761 --> 01:01:21.830]  Blish, I believe you pronounce it, Michael Bagnerik, Chuck Baldwin, Constitution Party presidential candidate, very credible, and a lot of others.
[01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:31.122]  And it's Camp FEMA, it ships the 18th of September, so about 18 days from now.
[01:01:32.133 --> 01:01:38.038]  I think William's going to let us all a few days before, because we're one of the big places to get it at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:38.299 --> 01:01:41.382]  Start shipping it so folks get it on the 18th or around the 18th.
[01:01:41.922 --> 01:01:42.663]  On DVD.
[01:01:42.743 --> 01:01:43.684]  DVD premiere.
[01:01:43.944 --> 01:01:44.825]  Have viewing parties.
[01:01:44.905 --> 01:01:45.665]  Show it to people.
[01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:55.715]  We can stop them if they're able to see this film, because it shows how they're introducing it, how they're selling it, how the camps are good and for your safety and a wonderful thing.
[01:01:56.684 --> 01:02:04.230]  We also have it comboed up with a new film just released today, New World Order, on DVD that I'm the main person in and also consulted on.
[01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:09.215]  This on DVD with a whole bunch of extras, a giant group of extras.
[01:02:09.255 --> 01:02:14.259]  It's a film in its own right as well, so you definitely want to get New World Order.
[01:02:14.459 --> 01:02:19.864]  All of this is available at InfoWars.com today or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:02:23.587 --> 01:02:27.189]  Now for the next hour and 50 minutes, we're joined by William Lewis.
[01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:29.990]  Coming up in the last hour, Gary Franchi, the producer, joins us.
[01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:34.613]  They traveled all over the country to real FEMA camps, talked to congressmen about FEMA camps.
[01:02:34.673 --> 01:02:35.653]  It's just an amazing film.
[01:02:37.174 --> 01:02:46.879]  And I didn't talk to William before the show, but I'm going to find out during a break if there's a clip or two in the film that he thinks we should play here today, not just the trailers.
[01:02:47.859 --> 01:02:53.062]  But William, very exciting, and I just want to say great job on Camp FEMA.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.881]  Hey man, I appreciate it, and thanks for having me on.
[01:02:55.921 --> 01:03:03.705]  You know, you had a large part in making Camp FEMA, so don't forget to thank yourself.
[01:03:03.766 --> 01:03:08.868]  And I thank you as well, and I think that once people get a chance to see this, they're going to be coming back to you for some more information.
[01:03:10.409 --> 01:03:15.572]  You know, this was a million different pieces that we had to whittle down to about a thousand and put together.
[01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:22.016]  So, obviously, everything that all of our guests said in the documentary when we were shooting didn't make it in there.
[01:03:23.334 --> 01:03:39.103]  I think that you'll notice, you and John Stattmiller, Catherine Bleich, a couple of others there, Baldwin, Sidenarik, there were several people that we gave special treatment to because you guys really are on the forefront.
[01:03:40.243 --> 01:03:46.208]  Yeah, I've got to say, Stattmiller, I've never really seen him do TV.
[01:03:46.228 --> 01:03:47.890]  He comes across really good on camera.
[01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:53.835]  So, I mean, again, the film is, you want to hand something to somebody and say, here's the proof of the FEMA camps.
[01:03:54.236 --> 01:03:57.239]  You want to give something to Glenn Beck, or go to these tea parties, this is it.
[01:03:57.859 --> 01:04:05.645]  Now, I know you're mass-producing it right now, and we've already gotten some in, but we're going to get the big group in in about a week and a half or so.
[01:04:06.025 --> 01:04:10.288]  When can I start shipping these so people get them on the 18th?
[01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.531]  Or, William, will we be shipping these on the 18th?
[01:04:14.812 --> 01:04:22.838]  Well, it really depends on the manufacturer, and we've gotten good news that they're ahead of schedule, so you may actually be able to ship those out a little bit ahead of time.
[01:04:24.145 --> 01:04:25.506]  I can't guarantee it right at this point.
[01:04:25.526 --> 01:04:29.790]  I've got to wait a little bit further along in production, so that I know exactly what the ship date is.
[01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:37.256]  But, you know, you guys are getting a special drop shipment right to your location, so you might probably have those a couple of days ahead of everybody else.
[01:04:39.438 --> 01:04:43.462]  I don't see any problems with selling them early, or shipping them out earlier, doing any of that.
[01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:44.603]  No, no, you've always done that.
[01:04:44.643 --> 01:04:46.865]  You've got, is it five or six films under your belt?
[01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:49.764]  Seven!
[01:04:50.444 --> 01:04:50.805]  Seven.
[01:04:50.905 --> 01:04:52.525]  So, established filmmaker.
[01:04:53.086 --> 01:04:57.427]  First thing you ever did is you contacted me when I was making films of my own and said, hey, I'd like to come work with you.
[01:04:57.467 --> 01:04:59.548]  And I said, hey, it's me and my wife and one other guy.
[01:04:59.608 --> 01:05:00.809]  Sorry, I don't have the money to hire you.
[01:05:01.209 --> 01:05:04.010]  But I'm glad I didn't have the money to hire you because you're off on your own.
[01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:08.392]  That's what we need is lots of great people out making their own films.
[01:05:08.452 --> 01:05:10.953]  And William, I'm telling you, it's not just that I'm in this film.
[01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:13.794]  I think you'd ask me a few times being others and I was too busy.
[01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:16.695]  I'm in this because I didn't have the time to make a FEMA camp film.
[01:05:17.155 --> 01:05:18.475]  I advised, I consulted.
[01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:23.357]  You just did an incredible job and you've really knocked it out of the park on this one.
[01:05:23.457 --> 01:05:24.357]  All the films were great.
[01:05:24.737 --> 01:05:28.558]  I mean, look, folks, Camp FEMA is a real accomplishment.
[01:05:28.838 --> 01:05:30.099]  This has got to be seen.
[01:05:30.619 --> 01:05:31.619]  I haven't asked you this, though.
[01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:34.120]  Where are you about people making copies if they don't sell it?
[01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:39.287]  I've tried to go buy my own films or sell them on Amazon.
[01:05:39.307 --> 01:05:48.753]  We're about to start that and I can't because people claim they're their films and so I'm having to now write them letters and say you can't sell my films on Amazon because they're claiming that they own my films.
[01:05:49.093 --> 01:06:00.039]  She can get into trouble doing that but what I mean how is it gonna work kind of a blind eye of folks are handing these out to people because I want this film to go supernova on the streets William.
[01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.729]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:20.041]  And, you know, we haven't put it on the website yet, and this is mainly because we just don't have the funds to make the duplications yet, but as soon as we start getting them coming in, we'll be able to offer really inexpensive, you know, Patriot packs where you can get ten or a hundred of these things at a time at a very good discount.
[01:06:20.901 --> 01:06:25.824]  And, you know, we hope to kind of go that way, the way Aaron Russo did his release.
[01:06:25.884 --> 01:06:29.426]  So, I think this will probably be the best way.
[01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:38.666]  If you get a copy of the DVD, you're welcome to duplicate it for yourself and your immediate family members.
[01:06:38.706 --> 01:06:39.647]  That's not a problem at all.
[01:06:40.185 --> 01:06:43.968]  William, I've got a copy of the film coming up.
[01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:45.749]  Just start thinking about it now during the break.
[01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:46.069]  Tell me.
[01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.992]  So we can play a minute or two clip a couple times.
[01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.433]  Tell me a good spot.
[01:06:50.453 --> 01:06:51.934]  I mean, there's a lot of good spots here.
[01:06:52.354 --> 01:06:58.799]  Maybe when we're introducing the modern FEMA camps, a clip or two that we can play of the film for the first time for people here today.
[01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:05.424]  But for new listeners who don't know about the FEMA camps, tell folks about your journey, why you made the film.
[01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:08.971]  Obviously, Glenn Beck was saying six months ago it wasn't real.
[01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:10.131]  I know that spurred some of it.
[01:07:11.212 --> 01:07:14.013]  What the film covers, what you chronicle in Camp FEMA?
[01:07:15.173 --> 01:07:28.218]  Well, this journey began over ten years ago, back when I was just beginning to start learning about searching on the internet for these type of things, roughly 1995 or 6.
[01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:34.760]  Back then, even then, the information you could find on FEMA camps on the internet, and they weren't called FEMA camps, but
[01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:35.968]  I think so.
[01:07:58.194 --> 01:08:01.696]  You know, problem research and those types of things and putting them into a documentary.
[01:08:01.736 --> 01:08:03.717]  If I can prove them, we couldn't prove any of that stuff.
[01:08:03.757 --> 01:08:07.378]  That's why I say there was a million things that we had to whittle down to about a thousand.
[01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:08.059]  What's credible?
[01:08:08.079 --> 01:08:08.859]  What can we prove?
[01:08:09.199 --> 01:08:15.862]  That's why this documentary is so unique, because there's nothing in it that can in any way be disproved and knock a hole in something else.
[01:08:16.222 --> 01:08:25.466]  You know, the entire argument that is laid out, when people see this for the first time, they're going to, for the first time, realize that it's no longer an internet rumor.
[01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:26.487]  It never has been.
[01:08:27.577 --> 01:08:37.822]  All right, but you know, the whole process of getting here, you know, Gary and I teamed up on this about a year and a half ago, just shooting footage and collecting everything we needed.
[01:08:37.882 --> 01:08:42.083]  This is the first time we've had actors in a production.
[01:08:42.163 --> 01:08:47.806]  So Gary's niece, Christina Reese, plays our young victim.
[01:08:48.726 --> 01:08:57.030]  And I think this is kind of a different emotional catch to this particular documentary, which is why I think a lot of people are going to
[01:08:57.577 --> 01:08:58.258]  We're good to go.
[01:09:20.966 --> 01:09:43.571]  15 or 20 minutes of the documentary, and it really is a journey down the dark side of government and where this is not likely to head, but where this is going with the legislation that we're talking about that legitimizes these FEMA camps and the mindset of our leaders in Washington showing the legislation that they want to pass that demonizes people like you and me for simply speaking out about government policy.
[01:09:45.912 --> 01:09:48.053]  That's right, you can't just cover FEMA camps.
[01:09:48.073 --> 01:10:00.700]  You've got to show all the other legislation, the attacks on free speech, the government saying our number one threat is gun owners and veterans and we need to arrest them, and the police pulling veterans over and Ron Paul supporters.
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:07.003]  We just had a lady last hour, it happened to, and they said you got a short haircut, Ron Paul sticker, you may be terrorist.
[01:10:08.348 --> 01:10:15.033]  The whole Homeland Security System set up for We The People, lying to the good ol' boys, telling folks it was for Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:18.035]  So, you cover this in the film Camp FEMA.
[01:10:18.496 --> 01:10:19.617]  William, it's just amazing.
[01:10:19.657 --> 01:10:20.117]  Continue.
[01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:22.078]  Yeah, I mean, it's very up-to-date.
[01:10:22.138 --> 01:10:33.127]  People will notice news clips and things in this documentary that may only be a week or two old, simply because, you know, as we were finishing up the documentary, there were several things that broke.
[01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:35.534]  The Hal Turner story, for instance.
[01:10:35.554 --> 01:10:43.483]  We were lucky enough to be able to get that in there so that we could show people that the COINTEL operations from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s never really ended.
[01:10:43.523 --> 01:10:45.085]  They were just continued under different names.
[01:10:48.376 --> 01:10:59.163]  The Glenn Beck segment, I don't know if you really got a chance to see that or not, but I don't think it was in the first edit that we sent you, but the Glenn Beck segment turned out to be just absolutely hilarious.
[01:10:59.564 --> 01:11:07.669]  I mean, it is funny to watch, which is the reason why we had to actually stick it after the credits so people could get the film and you don't see Glenn Beck in there.
[01:11:07.689 --> 01:11:10.931]  You have to wait until the credits finish and then the Glenn Beck segment begins.
[01:11:11.531 --> 01:11:15.253]  And we did that mainly because it just totally broke the mood.
[01:11:15.774 --> 01:11:21.057]  It just totally broke the spell that we were trying to set for everybody because you're literally laughing on the floor.
[01:11:21.157 --> 01:11:35.926]  No, but that's smart because it's a serious film with all the proof, with congressmen admitting it, with all the documents, all their own admissions, people saying camps are good, not just people exposing camps, and then you cut to Beck lying and saying none of it exists.
[01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.916]  William Lewis, amazing job.
[01:11:42.137 --> 01:11:45.360]  I want to talk about how the film starts, the Japanese, what happened to them.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.682]  I want to open the phones up too.
[01:11:47.982 --> 01:11:52.326]  We're going to take the calls that have been holding and new callers on this subject at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:52.366 --> 01:11:52.666]  Stay with us.
[01:11:52.686 --> 01:11:54.708]  It's Camp FEMA with William Lewis, the director.
[01:11:59.861 --> 01:12:03.862]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:12:04.142 --> 01:12:07.003]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:14.045]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:19.667]  If we, the people, do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever.
[01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:26.469]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.

[01:12:55.972 --> 01:13:00.853]  It is a big idea.
[01:13:00.873 --> 01:13:02.974]  A new world order.
[01:13:03.694 --> 01:13:08.335]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:11.396]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:13:11.416 --> 01:13:13.696]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:13:14.196 --> 01:13:16.597]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:13:17.376 --> 01:13:24.681]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:13:27.728 --> 01:13:32.711]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:13:33.172 --> 01:13:36.654]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:13:37.054 --> 01:13:39.536]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:40.757]  Most people have no idea.
[01:13:40.777 --> 01:13:41.537]  They're not after money.
[01:13:41.557 --> 01:13:42.658]  They have all the money they need.
[01:13:42.838 --> 01:13:43.559]  They're after power.
[01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:44.679]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:13:56.487 --> 01:13:57.608]  You have been warned.
[01:13:58.549 --> 01:13:58.989]  Gold.
[01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:00.610]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:06.955]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:14:07.136 --> 01:14:10.979]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:14:11.319 --> 01:14:13.220]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.542]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:14:15.682 --> 01:14:22.468]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.

[01:15:57.424 --> 01:16:00.887]  The maker
[01:16:18.982 --> 01:16:20.803]  Of Camp FEMA, William Lewis is our guest.
[01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:25.487]  Now, I know we have anti-federalists, Andrew, Pat, Wayne, Vincent, and others holding.
[01:16:25.907 --> 01:16:29.490]  You'll be all over the map, but William Lewis is anti-globalist, anti-New World Order.
[01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:32.632]  He researches this stuff, so he can talk about any subject.
[01:16:33.072 --> 01:16:35.074]  But you might, while you're at it, want to ask him.
[01:16:35.114 --> 01:16:37.695]  I mean, they went to the real FEMA centers.
[01:16:37.756 --> 01:16:39.577]  They went and showed the fake FEMA centers.
[01:16:39.617 --> 01:16:41.818]  They put a lot of work into this.
[01:16:42.819 --> 01:16:45.921]  William can answer a lot of questions, his perspective on camps.
[01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:47.642]  You can ask me my perspective.
[01:16:47.682 --> 01:16:50.604]  I think I'm probably one of the top experts out there.
[01:16:50.644 --> 01:16:53.165]  I've in-depth studied this for a long time.
[01:16:53.226 --> 01:16:55.867]  I could even predict how Beck was going to whitewash.
[01:16:57.748 --> 01:17:00.750]  So we're fully aware of how these guys operate.
[01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.633]  But we're going to take some calls right now and get more into the film of William Lewis coming up.
[01:17:05.133 --> 01:17:09.676]  Anti-Federalist from Georgia, you're on the air with our guest, William Lewis.
[01:17:09.696 --> 01:17:09.996]  Go ahead.
[01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:18.224]  Hey Alex, I have a few comments, unfortunately nothing specifically FEMA, but I just wanted to throw them out there real quick.
[01:17:19.004 --> 01:17:26.907]  The first thing is a great documentary about what's going wrong with the one-child policy in China, and it's called China's Stolen Babies.
[01:17:27.745 --> 01:17:36.612]  Also, tonight, I wanted the viewers and the listeners to know there's a special on 9-11 conspiracies on National Geographic at 9.
[01:17:36.692 --> 01:17:42.136]  Let me just add to that, that in fact, I had that in my stack and I took it home.
[01:17:42.316 --> 01:17:44.157]  Will you get Jason, because he knows where it is.
[01:17:45.138 --> 01:17:54.444]  National Geographic has apologized about their previous film four years ago about why the towers collapsed, similar to the Nova special.
[01:17:55.350 --> 01:18:03.214]  I think theirs is called Why the Buildings Collapsed, Nova's Why the Towers Collapsed, using fake data about bad steel and fire melting it.
[01:18:03.254 --> 01:18:09.717]  They've now changed their story with a new whitewash they're gonna unveil tonight, but they've been forced to apologize.
[01:18:10.078 --> 01:18:14.840]  But I still have these idiots telling me why the towers collapsed and using their baloney, but go ahead.
[01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:19.002]  No, I'm sure it'll be very interesting to see what they have to say.
[01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:22.604]  Also, I just got back from DC last week,
[01:18:23.371 --> 01:18:29.934]  And, uh, of course, there was a lot of things I could say about my trip, but I did come back with some kind of flu, and I'm happy to say I'm over it.
[01:18:30.715 --> 01:18:42.700]  And, uh, there are swastikas all over the Federal Reserve Building, all around the, uh, I don't know what you would call it, but the freezes, the stone carvings that outline the building.
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.863]  There's lots of symbols all over there, but swastikas I did find and took some pictures of it.
[01:18:47.943 --> 01:18:49.924]  So, I just wanted to put that out there.
[01:18:49.964 --> 01:18:50.624]  Thanks for your time.
[01:18:52.297 --> 01:18:57.343]  You mean not swastikas put up by citizens, but in the carving the swastikas?
[01:18:58.384 --> 01:18:59.004]  Absolutely.
[01:18:59.104 --> 01:19:00.346]  Oh yeah, I mean, I mean...
[01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:06.220]  Until 1940, American school children did the Hitler salute.
[01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:10.323]  You can Google, American school children do Hitler salute at all major high schools.
[01:19:10.343 --> 01:19:11.123]  You can show you L.A.
[01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:11.903]  high school doing it.
[01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:18.067]  And they put the fasci, the symbol of fascism, the bundle of sticks with the hatchet heads in the U.S.
[01:19:18.107 --> 01:19:18.407]  Senate.
[01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:21.769]  And we were going to go that way with eugenics and everything else.
[01:19:22.209 --> 01:19:23.169]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:23.489 --> 01:19:24.830]  William Lewis, comments on that?
[01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:27.652]  Well, who says we didn't go that way?
[01:19:28.032 --> 01:19:30.173]  They just figured out a better way to disguise it.
[01:19:31.556 --> 01:19:32.657]  And that's all I'll add to that.
[01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:34.357]  Good point.
[01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:37.198]  Andrew in Canada, you're on the air with the maker of Camp FEMA.
[01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:40.279]  Hi Alex, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:19:40.299 --> 01:19:44.520]  I've been listening for just over a year now and I'd like to thank you for waking me up, first of all.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:54.743]  In Canada, it's funny actually, because Canadians are always apologizing for everything and I actually, I've gotten to the point where I just say, apology accepted, when they're always apologizing.
[01:19:54.763 --> 01:19:58.284]  But I'd like to apologize to everyone out there for not waking up sooner.
[01:19:59.216 --> 01:20:06.019]  Um, it's a very traumatic experience to wake up, and I think that that should be discussed more.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:13.063]  Especially, I mean, you know, it's literally like your world is turned upside down, and I'm through it now, and I get it.
[01:20:13.103 --> 01:20:17.285]  You were calling earlier, you were saying, oh, who out there, you know, can see the whole thing.
[01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:23.467]  I can see this, you know, big machine of eugenics, which, you know, it requires humans.
[01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:26.769]  The humans are the gears and the cogs of this big machine, and they can't
[01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:32.888]  Go forward with any of this, unless people, you know, willingly are part of it.
[01:20:32.968 --> 01:20:38.189]  And I guess... And they're racing to put it in place right now, because they know their time is short.
[01:20:38.549 --> 01:20:41.470]  They know the people are waking up exponentially.
[01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:45.391]  But when you really face the horror, you're like, how could I not have been involved?
[01:20:45.431 --> 01:20:52.314]  And I had an epiphany a few days ago, and I'm going to hold you over if need be, Collar, because I want you to continue to make your point, Andrea, but I want to add this now.
[01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:53.514]  I had an epiphany.
[01:20:54.813 --> 01:20:57.054]  The elites at the very top are fully conscious.
[01:20:57.574 --> 01:20:58.815]  They know the master plan.
[01:20:58.855 --> 01:20:59.555]  They know what they're doing.
[01:20:59.575 --> 01:21:12.421]  But most of their minions, I mean even senators and people, are compartmentalized and are picked by the system because they'll go along and rationalize and even believe a lot of their own propaganda.
[01:21:13.922 --> 01:21:16.383]  And that's the thing is that it's not just
[01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:25.871]  That the good people aren't awake, bad people aren't awake, selfish people aren't awake to just what this world they're creating is.
[01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:34.636]  And so all this denial, all this rationalization, all this denying what's going on is destroying human society and our liberties and freedoms.
[01:21:35.097 --> 01:21:38.539]  I want to get William Lewis' comment on that statement, then go back to Andrew.
[01:21:38.879 --> 01:21:42.001]  When we come back, then Wayne, Vincent, Sam, Virgil, and others.
[01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:44.663]  We're talking about FEMA camps for the rest of the show.
[01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:52.305]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.267 --> 01:21:55.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:02.764]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:03.024 --> 01:22:04.806]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:05.026 --> 01:22:13.314]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:13.555 --> 01:22:18.780]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.722]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:20.962 --> 01:22:27.283]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:27.463 --> 01:22:38.226]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:38.506 --> 01:22:39.026]  That's right.
[01:22:39.286 --> 01:22:41.606]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:41.846 --> 01:22:43.407]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:22:46.007 --> 01:23:03.832]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:23:03.952 --> 01:23:08.314]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:23:08.494 --> 01:23:10.334]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:23:10.754 --> 01:23:12.115]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:23:12.375 --> 01:23:13.415]  There is a solution.
[01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:21.661]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:29.147]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:23:35.572 --> 01:23:41.157]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:23:41.577 --> 01:23:45.383]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:23:58.953 --> 01:24:03.916]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:24:29.213 --> 01:24:29.513]  We're good.
[01:25:10.904 --> 01:25:13.566]  For decades, people exposed chemtrails.
[01:25:13.686 --> 01:25:14.787]  Scientists tested it.
[01:25:15.608 --> 01:25:17.349]  Fish and wildlife people tested it.
[01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:29.820]  We've now been flying around the country for an upcoming film interviewing mayors and fish and wildlife people and government scientists and climatologists and weather weapons experts who work for the federal government.
[01:25:31.385 --> 01:25:35.066]  One of them was the head of the Naval Weapons Facility.
[01:25:35.686 --> 01:25:37.687]  Naval Weapons Research Laboratory.
[01:25:37.747 --> 01:25:39.448]  I mean, the head of it.
[01:25:40.248 --> 01:25:41.248]  All of this is real.
[01:25:41.648 --> 01:25:42.369]  It's going on.
[01:25:42.409 --> 01:25:56.113]  And then they just come out after this and go, yeah, we are spraying barium salts and aluminum dioxide that causes brain damage in all creatures, including not just humans, but reptile and also birds.
[01:25:58.634 --> 01:26:00.715]  So the ornithologist should be concerned about that.
[01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:05.272]  And then now they just come on and go, yeah, we've been doing tests.
[01:26:05.852 --> 01:26:10.675]  All of this was the Department of Energy test and we're doing it with partners worldwide to manipulate the weather.
[01:26:10.735 --> 01:26:18.240]  And we are practicing to knock out different types of weather to create floods and to create droughts.
[01:26:19.787 --> 01:26:23.789]  We're terraforming and they have government textbooks for school children.
[01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:31.894]  And the last three years have come out where they just, you know, in Missouri and Texas and California teach the kids, the government is spraying sunscreen.
[01:26:32.235 --> 01:26:35.176]  That's what those trails are to protect you from global warming.
[01:26:37.057 --> 01:26:39.679]  But then all the studies show it actually increases global warming.
[01:26:39.939 --> 01:26:41.860]  Because the ultraviolet just goes right through it.
[01:26:44.042 --> 01:26:46.183]  And then bounces back up and is captured.
[01:26:46.403 --> 01:26:47.584]  Look, it's insane.
[01:26:48.004 --> 01:26:49.205]  It's just like these FEMA camps.
[01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:52.069]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[01:26:53.990 --> 01:27:11.675]  And you wake up to this and you realize you're all part of a giant project with a scientific dictatorship playing God, and you just can't only care about baseball, or your church, or fishing anymore, or whatever it is, or two-stepping at the local bar.
[01:27:11.695 --> 01:27:12.436]  I don't know what you do.
[01:27:12.496 --> 01:27:19.878]  The point is, we better... I was talking to some pretty high-powered Hollywood people last week.
[01:27:20.882 --> 01:27:21.663]  When I was in L.A.
[01:27:21.763 --> 01:27:24.745]  on a project and they said, yeah, how do you go back?
[01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:31.890]  How do you care about any of this petty stuff anymore once you know about the New World Order?
[01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:39.436]  They want to keep you caught up in left and right and black and white and male and female and straight and gay and all these little things they have us fighting over.
[01:27:41.237 --> 01:27:45.461]  Meanwhile, or North versus South or Chinese versus America.
[01:27:45.821 --> 01:27:49.664]  Meanwhile, the global corporations are playing all of us off against each other.
[01:27:54.472 --> 01:27:56.113]  And this is the issue.
[01:27:56.213 --> 01:27:59.676]  Everything else is a side issue to the world government and what they're doing.
[01:28:00.176 --> 01:28:07.441]  I want to go back to Wayne in Canada to finish the statement he was making, and then back to the director of Camp FEMA, William Lewis.
[01:28:07.481 --> 01:28:07.861]  Go ahead.
[01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:11.323]  It's Andrew Alex.
[01:28:11.644 --> 01:28:12.444]  Andrew in Canada.
[01:28:12.484 --> 01:28:13.245]  Wayne's next, yeah.
[01:28:13.725 --> 01:28:16.087]  Yeah, well, I mean, doublespeak.
[01:28:16.367 --> 01:28:17.367]  I think it's a huge thing.
[01:28:17.468 --> 01:28:19.069]  It's everywhere.
[01:28:19.089 --> 01:28:22.551]  I think people really need to learn more to recognize the doublespeak.
[01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:29.682]  You know, for example, when the president comes out and says, you know, we are achieving our goals, he's not talking about the American people.
[01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:32.103]  He's talking about his cronies, his insiders.
[01:28:32.783 --> 01:28:34.944]  You know, he's talking about that team, the elites.
[01:28:35.484 --> 01:28:42.085]  And he's just saying it to you as if, you know, people, I guess, they're expected to think that they're part of it, but they're obviously not.
[01:28:42.665 --> 01:28:43.926]  And it's all over the place.
[01:28:43.946 --> 01:28:44.826]  The writing is on the wall.
[01:28:46.169 --> 01:28:48.550]  If you want to know about chemtrails, look up in the air!
[01:28:49.051 --> 01:28:49.831]  There's chemtrails above the air!
[01:28:49.851 --> 01:29:00.718]  Well, you're right, but I mean, the politicians love to say something that's a message to their people, and they write about this in their memoirs, and then, and it has a double meaning for the sheep, for the cattle.
[01:29:00.758 --> 01:29:01.518]  They just love that.
[01:29:03.239 --> 01:29:04.140]  They get something out of it.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.822]  It somehow increases the rush they get from whatever this dark power is.
[01:29:09.643 --> 01:29:14.786]  But, you know, you also talk about solutions, and with regard to the FEMA camps, I actually was
[01:29:15.307 --> 01:29:31.500]  When I did wake up, I was in the middle of making an album and I ended up changing all sorts of the songs and lyrics around once I had discovered, you know, once I'd gone down the rabbit hole and discovered this, you know, this thick and twisted vision that's being played out by the elite.
[01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:43.330]  And in the second track on the album, which is called Eugene Nixon, I actually say, we got led down to the nice new safe camp to learn all about Eugene Nixon.
[01:29:44.173 --> 01:29:47.696]  We got knocked out in the greatest time to be rolling around like a pig in its pen.
[01:29:48.597 --> 01:29:58.907]  And, you know, people are being led down, you know, this path thinking that it's all, you know, grand and great and they have no idea that there's a big, you know, grinder at the end of the road.
[01:29:58.967 --> 01:29:59.528]  Absolutely.
[01:29:59.988 --> 01:30:00.769]  I appreciate your call.
[01:30:00.809 --> 01:30:04.953]  Well, more than that, they know something's wrong, but Bush is bad, Obama will fix it.
[01:30:05.053 --> 01:30:06.574]  And now, will Obama
[01:30:07.598 --> 01:30:12.261]  Obama's bad, but only because the evil right-wingers won't let him do what he needs to do.
[01:30:12.321 --> 01:30:12.981]  It's their fault.
[01:30:13.301 --> 01:30:14.482]  We need to arrest them.
[01:30:14.502 --> 01:30:24.968]  I mean, I get hundreds of emails, no exaggeration today, when I look at YouTube in the comments, every third or fourth comment is, you're a racist white pig, you need to be arrested.
[01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:27.209]  You click on their channel, it's a white person.
[01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:36.454]  Or I look at local newspapers about the ObamaInfoWars.com joker poster contest, and they're saying, these racists need to be arrested, they're dangerous.
[01:30:37.329 --> 01:30:40.652]  Well, I think that's a very touchy subject.
[01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:08.079]  Really no appropriate way necessarily to handle this other than to just simply judge each president on their merits, and I think that that's what we've got to do.
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.581]  You know, we knew Obama's record before he went into office.
[01:31:13.641 --> 01:31:18.062]  I know that you were on your radio program telling people, you've got to watch out for this guy.
[01:31:18.102 --> 01:31:19.543]  You had the Obama deception out.
[01:31:19.583 --> 01:31:23.104]  You know, there was a lot of things going on, but still, all in all, the guy got elected.
[01:31:23.704 --> 01:31:24.264]  Big surprise.
[01:31:28.499 --> 01:31:29.600]  Touchy subject.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.345]  I just think we should judge people on their merits, what they've done.
[01:31:33.365 --> 01:31:33.785]  F-31, F-33.
[01:31:33.965 --> 01:31:41.895]  But I mean, it's so American, it's so human to criticize the corrupt emperor, the king, the leader.
[01:31:42.475 --> 01:31:46.861]  And over and over again, I have several newscasts, in fact, guys, will you cue up the North Texas
[01:31:48.533 --> 01:31:53.674]  Did I give you that latest TV report where they're going, I think it's wrong to show our president in a bad light.
[01:31:54.054 --> 01:31:57.715]  Thank God we got him taken down before any young people saw them.
[01:31:57.735 --> 01:32:02.976]  You know, they're acting like our supporters were posting pornography or something.
[01:32:04.136 --> 01:32:09.517]  Again, to call him a socialist, to call him a fascist, it isn't racist, it's just because he's black.
[01:32:10.877 --> 01:32:13.698]  Again, they're using that as a political tool is what I'm saying, William.
[01:32:14.498 --> 01:32:15.158]  Sure, I understand.
[01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:37.296]  You know, if they feel that way, they're really going to hate Camp FEMA because, you know, we've got an entire segment in there dedicated to showing how Obama's putting together this youth army, just like we saw put together in Nazi Germany, which of course was outlawed at one point because they knew what it was, and then Hitler managed to get it reinstated.
[01:32:37.536 --> 01:32:41.058]  Their Hitler Youth essentially became known as.
[01:32:42.937 --> 01:32:52.747]  Well that's why in Africa they love 10, 11, 12, 13 year old citizen soldiers because they're wild fighters and think it's all a game and will do whatever they're told.
[01:32:54.509 --> 01:32:57.372]  Well this is the great thing about getting a hold of young minds.
[01:32:58.033 --> 01:32:59.715]  You can train those young minds
[01:33:00.515 --> 01:33:04.657]  With all sorts of propaganda and have them do anything that you want.
[01:33:04.677 --> 01:33:06.258]  I mean, and how innocent, too.
[01:33:06.278 --> 01:33:10.700]  I mean, this is, you know, this was kind of the whole idea of the Youth Army to begin with.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:19.263]  Those will be the spies in your community that will turn people over to the authorities because they did something that they weren't supposed to.
[01:33:19.884 --> 01:33:24.626]  You know, as innocent as a paperboy showing up to deliver the paper, see something on your desk that might be
[01:33:25.521 --> 01:33:26.121]  You know, whatever.
[01:33:26.181 --> 01:33:26.601]  Mailman.
[01:33:26.681 --> 01:33:34.164]  I mean, this was a program that was started in the Bush administration where they had mailmen going around and profiling people that they were delivering the mail to.
[01:33:34.184 --> 01:33:35.665]  So this is really not anything new.
[01:33:35.685 --> 01:33:37.105]  It's just being carried one step further.
[01:33:39.726 --> 01:33:40.286]  Absolutely.
[01:33:40.326 --> 01:33:50.010]  We're going to play a select from your film Camp FEMA here in just a few minutes and continue with phone calls into the next hour with Gary Franchi and you'll stay with us.
[01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:52.511]  But since I mentioned it and I've got
[01:33:53.436 --> 01:33:54.976]  A whole bunch of video newscasts.
[01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:55.736]  These are coming in.
[01:33:55.817 --> 01:33:57.537]  So many of them, I can't even watch it.
[01:33:57.857 --> 01:34:09.479]  A huge information war coup in that from Berlin, Germany, to Tokyo, Japan, from Moscow, Russia, to major capital cities in Central and South America.
[01:34:09.499 --> 01:34:20.782]  I've now been on Ecuadorian TV, other channels, the Obama... Obama as... Yeah, we're playing a clip there in the background.
[01:34:20.802 --> 01:34:21.522]  Let's hold off for a second.
[01:34:23.596 --> 01:34:27.138]  Everywhere, this is being covered.
[01:34:28.318 --> 01:34:32.860]  And it's not just because it's InfoWars.com and Obama is the joker to catch people's attention.
[01:34:33.921 --> 01:34:45.026]  Now our new contest is $1,000 for whoever makes the best poster, period, as long as it has InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com on it, videotapes putting those posters up on YouTube.
[01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:48.967]  And I will judge it off the best video about the posters and the poster itself.
[01:34:49.268 --> 01:34:51.709]  That's what's fed into the decision of who wins.
[01:34:53.032 --> 01:34:57.136]  But it's all about showing people the power of just putting up posters.
[01:34:57.496 --> 01:35:02.180]  For a decade or more before 1776, that's what our forebearers did.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.905]  Even if they shut the web down, shut TV off, shut our communications off, which the Pentagon's announcing
[01:35:09.349 --> 01:35:18.454]  They are setting up a takeover of the internet to shut down opposition to NORTHCOM and the 400,000 troops they've now announced they plan on putting on the streets.
[01:35:18.494 --> 01:35:20.735]  They're trying a hot coup takeover.
[01:35:21.275 --> 01:35:24.617]  They've listed veterans and gun owners and landowners as the terrorists.
[01:35:24.717 --> 01:35:26.538]  You are being listed as terrorists.
[01:35:26.618 --> 01:35:27.438]  This is real.
[01:35:27.678 --> 01:35:34.742]  What happened in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia and Maoist China and Pol Pot's Cambodia and Fidel Castro's Cuba is now happening.
[01:35:36.923 --> 01:35:43.071]  Obama's new FCC head of, quote, diversity officer says they want to put in Chavez controls here.
[01:35:43.091 --> 01:35:46.015]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[01:35:46.636 --> 01:35:50.421]  And so, make whatever poster you want, get out there and put it up.
[01:35:51.322 --> 01:35:51.703]  Okay?
[01:35:52.284 --> 01:35:54.567]  And then send us the video of you posting the poster.
[01:35:56.007 --> 01:36:00.549]  Any comments on our whole poster campaign and its success?
[01:36:00.689 --> 01:36:01.229]  I did it!
[01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:06.612]  Showing people their power if they'll just take action with a message, with an idea.
[01:36:09.153 --> 01:36:14.516]  Yeah, posters are definitely the way to go, especially if the internet ends up getting shut down.
[01:36:15.216 --> 01:36:20.338]  DVDs obviously are a great way to go because people don't have to read, they can just pop in and watch it.
[01:36:20.699 --> 01:36:23.440]  But a poster, if you're clever enough about designing your poster,
[01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:26.433]  No, they've tried to create a chilling effect.
[01:36:26.473 --> 01:36:28.455]  They've dropped the charges on the teen, or never filed them.
[01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:41.570]  Because it blew up in their face.
[01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:43.472]  They tried to intimidate, and it didn't work.
[01:36:43.492 --> 01:36:45.393]  People put up more, so they backed off in Florida.
[01:36:45.814 --> 01:36:47.715]  But no, do it legally and lawfully.
[01:36:47.755 --> 01:36:48.536]  Take Hayes County.
[01:36:48.916 --> 01:36:50.077]  In fact, that article's out on the desk.
[01:36:50.217 --> 01:36:51.939]  Somebody grab it for me about the hate crime I've committed.
[01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:59.105]  It said it's not illegal that Alex Jones's listeners are putting him up in Hayes County, but we need to pass a law to make it illegal.
[01:36:59.145 --> 01:36:59.546]  Go ahead.
[01:37:02.028 --> 01:37:06.251]  Yeah, this is, you know, the continuation of the
[01:37:08.198 --> 01:37:09.399]  We're good to go.
[01:37:34.497 --> 01:37:44.151]  That's right, there's a total congruency, and the National Security Council is the true dictatorship over FEMA, over NORTHCOM, and all presidents are just frontmen.
[01:37:45.874 --> 01:37:49.617]  Exactly, so I don't know that it really makes any difference who's in power.
[01:37:49.637 --> 01:38:05.110]  The problem that we've got here is that anyone who opposes the administration on anything, I mean literally we're talking about something as simple as immigration or abortion, you know, things that they've used in the past heavily to divide the Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:06.151]  Now they're coming out and saying,
[01:38:06.631 --> 01:38:06.872]  I don't know.
[01:38:26.218 --> 01:38:27.919]  And those are the rules, I think.
[01:38:28.179 --> 01:38:35.924]  Those are the ones we discussed that are going to be used to haul those people off to these FEMA camps and contain them, keep them away from the public.
[01:38:36.404 --> 01:38:39.787]  You know, the FEMA camp will be your free speech at all.
[01:38:39.967 --> 01:38:42.648]  Go there and say what you need to say and you can't leave.
[01:38:44.069 --> 01:38:45.030]  Anyway, you know, it's a...
[01:38:50.066 --> 01:38:51.887]  And William, this is not your opinion.
[01:38:51.927 --> 01:39:01.932]  When they say, if your Homeland Security National ID card, now they issue a Hemispheric North American ID card, that the TV ads are on television, people are still in denial.
[01:39:03.064 --> 01:39:06.945]  If you don't pay your bills, if you have bad credit, they're going to turn the card off.
[01:39:06.985 --> 01:39:07.666]  This has been announced.
[01:39:07.726 --> 01:39:17.589]  I saw Ridge in 2002, before Homeland Security even got funding, in a congressional roundtable, four big tables together in a square.
[01:39:18.826 --> 01:39:19.967]  And he was explaining it.
[01:39:20.227 --> 01:39:21.929]  You're going to have to have this ID to have a job.
[01:39:22.329 --> 01:39:23.430]  You're going to have to have this ID.
[01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:24.851]  There'll be no underground economy.
[01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:26.312]  No garage sales allowed.
[01:39:26.953 --> 01:39:28.554]  No more roadside sales.
[01:39:29.415 --> 01:39:30.716]  Everything's going to be controlled.
[01:39:30.736 --> 01:39:35.119]  We're going to have TSA in the streets, at the malls, on the buses, in the trains.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.200]  Checkpoints.
[01:39:36.801 --> 01:39:40.263]  The feds are going to take over the local cities through the threat fusion centers.
[01:39:40.784 --> 01:39:41.384]  Through FEMA.
[01:39:42.305 --> 01:40:07.893]  And he was saying how great this was and how and then now they say no fly list a million two hundred thousand and growing on it now you'll be a no gun by list and they openly are announcing that we'll just say you can't own a gun no judge no jury are not arrested and their own homeland security documents leaked to us that we put out from good people inside a federal marshal gave it to us I'll just
[01:40:08.752 --> 01:40:09.253]  Leave it at that.
[01:40:10.033 --> 01:40:13.918]  Says, gun owners and veterans are the number one threat to America.
[01:40:14.238 --> 01:40:17.161]  It's all for the American people!
[01:40:17.462 --> 01:40:18.984]  It was never about Al-Qaeda!
[01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:20.465]  Al-Qaeda's CIA!
[01:40:20.505 --> 01:40:20.886]  Go ahead.
[01:40:23.957 --> 01:40:27.139]  Yeah, you know, you probably can add a few other things to that list, too.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:41.248]  Gun control, Federal Reserve, if you're against the United Nations, or North American Union, if you even mention the word New World Order, if you have a problem with your income tax, or being radio-frequently identified with an RFID chip and track.
[01:40:41.934 --> 01:40:45.435]  That's a problem for them if you are against abortion or illegal immigration.
[01:40:45.795 --> 01:40:47.116]  Those are their main topics.
[01:40:47.556 --> 01:40:57.539]  If you're protesting the Fed, and now they're saying if you say no to the naked body scanner, don't put your wife and kids in it, to scan your naked body, they're going to put you on a no-fly list as a terrorist.
[01:40:57.599 --> 01:41:00.360]  I mean, this government is completely rogue and criminal.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.060]  Absolutely.
[01:41:02.361 --> 01:41:09.943]  This all ties into, like you were mentioning before, people who own private property and who believe that their private property rights
[01:41:10.692 --> 01:41:18.237]  Outweigh any federal intervention or even states coming in and saying that if you don't pay your taxes, we're going to take that property away from you.
[01:41:18.637 --> 01:41:19.517]  Those types of issues.
[01:41:20.198 --> 01:41:22.699]  I know that this is really big right now in Kansas City.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:29.624]  In fact, we covered the 10th Amendment as part of the conclusion in this documentary as a solution.
[01:41:30.404 --> 01:41:33.386]  And what we're talking about, of course, is states' rights.
[01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:43.991]  Citizens, the citizenry going back and electing sheriffs in their communities that they know uphold and stand for the Constitution.
[01:41:44.351 --> 01:41:49.192]  And then again, getting involved yourself, running for these local offices where politics actually begins.
[01:41:49.272 --> 01:41:54.934]  Because if you can affect, you know, if you can influence your local politics, that's where it all begins.
[01:41:55.074 --> 01:41:58.435]  And that trickles up to your state, which is where it's supposed to stop.
[01:41:58.975 --> 01:42:03.156]  But unfortunately, you know, the feds have found a way to sneak in there and try to withhold
[01:42:04.028 --> 01:42:10.070]  You know, federal aid or funding for whatever reason if you don't sign on to their new legislation or whatever they have in store for you.
[01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:10.810]  That's it.
[01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:12.151]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:22.294]  We've got to say no to the federal government that itself is run by offshore private banks openly and we've just got to say you're illegitimate, you're criminal, it's over!
[01:42:22.534 --> 01:42:24.574]  Your NORTHCOM isn't going to march against us.
[01:42:25.155 --> 01:42:30.156]  I mean, have you seen in the AP where they're announcing 400,000 troops to now occupy the U.S.?
[01:42:30.236 --> 01:42:32.097]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:42:33.424 --> 01:42:34.124]  This is real.
[01:42:35.225 --> 01:42:37.646]  And no amount of thumb-sucking or denial is going to stop it.
[01:42:38.006 --> 01:42:46.469]  Only getting up, getting angry, getting focused, getting Camp FEMA, getting the Obama deception, getting the New World Order, the new film we're also selling at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:46.489 --> 01:42:48.850]  A lot of stuff getting announced, a lot of stuff happening right now.
[01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:51.071]  Get it, get it all out to everybody.
[01:42:51.111 --> 01:42:52.052]  William Lewis is our guest.
[01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:57.874]  We're going to play a little five-minute sneak peek of the film on the other side and go to more of your calls.
[01:42:59.226 --> 01:42:59.926]  Hello, friends.
[01:42:59.966 --> 01:43:02.968]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[01:43:03.108 --> 01:43:12.973]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[01:43:13.273 --> 01:43:16.975]  Go to 5Starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:17.195 --> 01:43:18.976]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:43:19.156 --> 01:43:22.638]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[01:43:22.978 --> 01:43:25.119]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[01:43:25.539 --> 01:43:30.485]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[01:43:30.745 --> 01:43:35.610]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:40.696]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:43:41.136 --> 01:43:42.358]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:43:42.418 --> 01:43:50.927]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling toll free 1-800-340-7091 or check them out online at 5starsoap.com.
[01:43:51.227 --> 01:43:54.691]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[01:43:54.791 --> 01:43:55.652]  You're going to love them.
[01:43:55.732 --> 01:43:57.374]  You will never use anything else again.
[01:44:02.378 --> 01:44:05.521]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:44:05.861 --> 01:44:07.803]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:44:08.183 --> 01:44:15.829]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:23.556]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:44:23.976 --> 01:44:30.802]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:44:31.337 --> 01:44:35.418]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:44:35.678 --> 01:44:39.219]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:44:39.659 --> 01:44:41.580]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.861]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:45:44.369 --> 01:45:45.190]  I think so.
[01:46:17.213 --> 01:46:19.577]  Want to leave in, want to leave out.
[01:46:32.842 --> 01:46:38.489]  We're going to continue with Wayne, Vincent, Sam in the Netherlands, Virgil in Ohio, and others in just a moment.
[01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:41.493]  We got William Lewis with us, the maker of Camp Fina.
[01:46:41.553 --> 01:46:42.975]  You can start pre-ordering it today.
[01:46:42.995 --> 01:46:46.178]  It's going to be shipping out in the next 15, 16, 17 days or so.
[01:46:46.219 --> 01:46:49.262]  The official release date is the 18th of September.
[01:46:50.214 --> 01:46:51.977]  I feature heavily in it, consulted on it.
[01:46:52.037 --> 01:46:53.058]  This is a great film.
[01:46:53.098 --> 01:46:53.820]  This is the truth.
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:56.824]  This needs to be seen to stop this whole agenda.
[01:46:56.844 --> 01:46:57.906]  We need to make this a big film.
[01:46:58.406 --> 01:47:03.194]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip here of some of the selects from Camp FEMA.
[01:47:03.234 --> 01:47:03.554]  Here it is.
[01:47:04.757 --> 01:47:07.659]  Technology has created a new brand of terrorism.
[01:47:08.119 --> 01:47:13.662]  There were persons who, for whatever reason, came to view their home country as the enemy.
[01:47:14.182 --> 01:47:16.984]  The kind of right-wing, religious-based domestic terrorism.
[01:47:17.184 --> 01:47:19.405]  Disturbing news tonight about homegrown terror.
[01:47:19.725 --> 01:47:25.829]  Part of this is a big change in the White House, a new cultural experience, and some of the crazies are coming out of their closet.
[01:47:26.169 --> 01:47:31.030]  Right now, it looks like there is no connection between the man arrested and any known terrorist cell.
[01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:31.751]  Homegrown.
[01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:32.831]  Yeah, homegrown, I should say.
[01:47:33.171 --> 01:47:35.472]  Folks, we've got a very serious situation here.
[01:47:35.552 --> 01:47:43.354]  I'm holding what is called the right-wing extremism, current economic and political climate, fueling resurgence and radicalization and recruitment.
[01:47:44.074 --> 01:47:48.516]  And in it we talked about the fact that they define pro-lifers as domestic terrorists.
[01:47:48.556 --> 01:48:09.407]  They put this in a Department of Homeland Security document, this official assessment, now saying pro-lifers, people that believe in end-time prophecies, people that are opposed to the administration's position on immigration, those of us that are standing up for the sanctity of life and for the sanctity of marriage, all of those are now potential, and this is what they're saying,
[01:48:09.887 --> 01:48:10.708]  Domestic terrorists.
[01:48:10.828 --> 01:48:14.710]  It's the terrorists next door that could be our bigger threat.
[01:48:14.890 --> 01:48:30.340]  They call people who believe in the sanctity of life, who believe in owning firearms, who believe in serving their country in the military and coming back, who are very concerned about the policies that this nation is embarking on, spending too much money, taxing too much.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.141]  It's all listed right here.
[01:48:32.876 --> 01:48:35.718]  These are the domestic right-wing extremists.
[01:48:36.118 --> 01:48:38.859]  One million names under the watchful eye of the United States.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:45.363]  America's so-called terrorist watch list has hit the record number according to one of the country's most prominent civil liberties groups.
[01:48:45.683 --> 01:48:47.444]  That's a lot of people to keep track of.
[01:48:47.484 --> 01:48:49.265]  They're adding new people all the time.
[01:48:49.465 --> 01:48:54.008]  It's a secret list that you don't know really quite how one gets on and you don't know how you get off.
[01:48:58.086 --> 01:49:02.568]  They're coming out and profiling huge groups of people.
[01:49:02.588 --> 01:49:07.890]  You know, if you voted for a certain political candidate, you should be considered a potential threat.
[01:49:08.771 --> 01:49:22.477]  And you couple that with things like the Patriot Act, where if you are a threat in their eyes, you can be held without access to judge, jury, and without access to a lawyer, or even to your family.
[01:49:23.417 --> 01:49:30.084]  That's very concerning, because we've watched our country go through and do this to brown people, you know, overseas.
[01:49:30.124 --> 01:49:35.389]  They're rounding up enemy combatants, and they're putting them in camps, and they are torturing them.
[01:49:35.429 --> 01:49:36.350]  That is a fact.
[01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:37.110]  We know that.
[01:49:39.452 --> 01:49:48.854]  In Missouri, a new document meant to help Missouri law enforcement agencies identify militia members or domestic terrorists has drawn criticism.
[01:49:49.534 --> 01:50:00.757]  The February 20 report, called the Modern Militia Movement, mentions such red flags as political bumper stickers for third-party candidates, such as Ron Paul, who ran for president,
[01:50:01.437 --> 01:50:08.401]  Talk of conspiracy theories such as the plan for a superhighway linking Canada to Mexico and possession of subversive literature.
[01:50:08.421 --> 01:50:17.007]  So the state police in Missouri have been told that if you see a car with a bumper sticker, that opposes the so-called creation of North American Union.
[01:50:18.092 --> 01:50:21.375]  The Silver Superhighway, that you are probably following a militia member.
[01:50:22.056 --> 01:50:24.819]  That you are following an anti-government radical.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:35.570]  If you see a car with a bumper sticker that says Ron Paul for President, you might be dealing with a violent radical, exercise, extreme... Alright, head pause.
[01:50:37.156 --> 01:50:45.445]  And now they say if you disagree with Obama, you're a racist.
[01:50:45.465 --> 01:50:49.529]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:50:49.829 --> 01:50:51.611]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[01:50:51.832 --> 01:50:52.632]  Well, you should.
[01:50:52.652 --> 01:50:57.057]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:50:57.297 --> 01:50:57.738]  That's right.
[01:50:58.078 --> 01:51:07.972]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:51:08.112 --> 01:51:13.520]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:21.966]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:51:22.326 --> 01:51:27.530]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:28.991]  This is real.
[01:51:29.311 --> 01:51:30.052]  Don't miss out.
[01:51:30.372 --> 01:51:38.758]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:44.802]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:51:44.982 --> 01:51:47.903]  Go to FrontSite.com for your training and free gun.
[01:52:07.199 --> 01:52:11.001]  We've got the sneak peeks and trailers and all the rest of it up at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:11.021 --> 01:52:17.164]  If you want to start pre-ordering, Camp FIBA ships out on or before September 18th.
[01:52:17.344 --> 01:52:23.927]  This film, New World Order on DVD, expanded with a bunch of great extras that I'm of course in and also consulted on.
[01:52:24.267 --> 01:52:28.269]  We're selling it available at InfoWars.com, discounted out of the gates.
[01:52:29.819 --> 01:52:30.699]  Hi, how are you Alex?
[01:52:30.719 --> 01:52:31.260]  I'm a first time caller.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:31.540]  Thank you.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.800]  I just want to let you know that my wife
[01:52:59.742 --> 01:53:15.350]  I was listening to your show for the last year and a half, two years, and I am now just becoming a believer in the last few months, but she has heard your comment about the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:16.951]  Okay?
[01:53:17.271 --> 01:53:18.692]  And we both believe that, of course.
[01:53:19.712 --> 01:53:29.197]  Now, what she has done is filed an actual document with the government to claim the power of the sun, the energy of the sun.
[01:53:30.345 --> 01:53:36.189]  And we have the business number, and now we have the documents for the patent.
[01:53:50.327 --> 01:53:53.949]  The science czar says they're doing this and want to expand it.
[01:53:54.469 --> 01:53:55.870]  That's hurting your crops.
[01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:56.890]  That's hurting your life.
[01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:00.772]  That's why they keep the details secret so people have trouble suing them.
[01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:02.913]  But I think that's a way to stop them.
[01:54:02.933 --> 01:54:04.114]  Let's bring William Lewis up.
[01:54:04.474 --> 01:54:08.056]  William, that's an intriguing idea that Wayne has in Canada.
[01:54:09.717 --> 01:54:15.659]  Yeah, I guess the question is whether they would actually let you take out a patent on something like that.
[01:54:15.699 --> 01:54:16.600]  What is the patent for?
[01:54:19.775 --> 01:54:21.077]  Yeah, what is the patent for, sir?
[01:54:21.578 --> 01:54:25.305]  Okay, the patent is not for the sun, it's for the energy from the sun.
[01:54:26.868 --> 01:54:27.249]  Gotcha.
[01:54:27.389 --> 01:54:30.355]  As in, as in to power a solar panel.
[01:54:32.073 --> 01:54:34.694]  Yeah, I think they only let you patent the device itself.
[01:54:35.154 --> 01:54:43.115]  You can't patent a naturally occurring thing, though that's what the GMO companies do when they alter something, then they claim ownership of it.
[01:54:44.115 --> 01:54:45.316]  But it's an intriguing idea.
[01:54:45.356 --> 01:54:48.616]  You ought to write it up as an idea, Wayne, just to get people thinking.
[01:54:48.656 --> 01:54:49.837]  I think it's a good exercise.
[01:54:50.217 --> 01:54:52.557]  Send it to us at writersandinfowars.com.
[01:54:52.577 --> 01:54:53.097]  Thank you, Wayne.
[01:54:53.517 --> 01:54:57.198]  Vincent in Virginia, then Sam and others.
[01:54:57.218 --> 01:54:57.858]  Go ahead, Vincent.
[01:54:58.638 --> 01:55:00.599]  Hi, Alex and Mr. Lewis.
[01:55:00.739 --> 01:55:01.859]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:55:03.099 --> 01:55:12.664]  Down here in Virginia near Old Dominion University campus, where the women are pretty and the Gardasil commercials flourish.
[01:55:15.265 --> 01:55:23.949]  I just had a couple of questions slash comments for you, Alex, and I had one for William Lewis.
[01:55:25.450 --> 01:55:28.011]  I was just wondering, I managed to get on
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:31.161]  Jason Burmiss' show a couple of weeks ago.
[01:55:31.181 --> 01:55:36.063]  This is the first time I've been on yours, so it's a real big thing for me right now.
[01:55:36.083 --> 01:55:37.664]  Well, it's big medicine, haven't you?
[01:55:37.684 --> 01:55:39.004]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:55:40.505 --> 01:55:49.829]  Well, I was just wanting to know if you had ever, he said he had never seen the movie The Hidden Agenda by G. Edward Griffin.
[01:55:52.526 --> 01:55:54.467]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[01:55:54.527 --> 01:55:57.509]  I heard it on AXS TV probably 10 years ago.
[01:55:57.730 --> 01:56:00.111]  I've seen a smattering of your movies.
[01:56:00.191 --> 01:56:01.292]  I bought a couple of them.
[01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:06.956]  It's kind of hard to believe all that stuff without having a background like that.
[01:56:07.897 --> 01:56:13.081]  For anybody who's a skeptic, that's definitely one I would recommend Googling.
[01:56:13.721 --> 01:56:17.804]  Well, G. Edward Griffin is in my new Fall of the Republic film.
[01:56:20.934 --> 01:56:22.375]  Just the list goes on and on.
[01:56:22.415 --> 01:56:23.596]  This film's going to blow people away.
[01:56:24.697 --> 01:56:26.198]  Yeah.
[01:56:26.298 --> 01:56:27.359]  I wish I made more money.
[01:56:27.379 --> 01:56:30.362]  I could get more of these movies that you guys put out.
[01:56:30.422 --> 01:56:33.564]  I mean, you can pass the free YouTube clips around.
[01:56:33.584 --> 01:56:37.027]  Endgame, Obama Deceptions, all free in its entirety on YouTube.
[01:56:39.881 --> 01:56:43.446]  Yeah, I just had another question for Mr. Lewis.
[01:56:43.466 --> 01:56:44.247]  All right, real fast.
[01:56:44.267 --> 01:56:45.689]  When we get back, you can ask that question.
[01:56:46.169 --> 01:56:47.791]  Good to hear from you there, Vincent.
[01:56:47.811 --> 01:56:53.178]  We'll come back then to Sam in the Netherlands, Virgil in Ohio, then Gary Franci, the producer of the film.
[01:56:55.902 --> 01:56:56.322]  Stay with us.
[01:56:58.988 --> 01:57:01.591]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:01.992 --> 01:57:06.979]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:07.339 --> 01:57:09.061]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:09.382 --> 01:57:13.968]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:13.988 --> 01:57:14.468]  We're good.
[01:57:33.542 --> 01:57:37.046]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:37.366 --> 01:57:38.367]  How much will you need?
[01:57:38.587 --> 01:57:39.208]  We don't know.
[01:57:39.488 --> 01:57:40.409]  How much do you want?
[01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:41.350]  All you can get.
[01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:42.371]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:42.631 --> 01:57:45.334]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:57:45.614 --> 01:57:47.816]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:47.857 --> 01:57:48.817]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:58.004 --> 01:58:03.171]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:03.311 --> 01:58:07.677]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:58:07.837 --> 01:58:09.700]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:11.462]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:58:11.742 --> 01:58:12.784]  There is a solution.
[01:58:13.004 --> 01:58:21.008]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:58:58.565 --> 01:59:00.045]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:59:00.245 --> 01:59:01.686]  What does humidity mean to you?

[02:00:03.502 --> 02:00:04.143]  Big Brother.
[02:00:04.824 --> 02:00:05.866]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:06.587 --> 02:00:07.688]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:07.969 --> 02:00:09.170]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.931 --> 02:00:10.873]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:10.893 --> 02:00:15.219]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:19.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.374 --> 02:00:25.598]  All right, we got about 52 minutes left in this final hour of transmission today.
[02:00:25.658 --> 02:00:26.999]  Gary Franchi's on with us.
[02:00:27.479 --> 02:00:29.461]  The filmmaker William Lewis is on with us.
[02:00:30.001 --> 02:00:31.202]  I want to open the phones up.
[02:00:31.322 --> 02:00:33.644]  I had a bunch of callers on from before William got on.
[02:00:33.944 --> 02:00:35.606]  Those callers are all now been gone too.
[02:00:36.126 --> 02:00:37.688]  I'm going to ask the people holding here
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:48.809]  Sam and Virgil and Tony and Abel and others, address questions about the FEMA camps, the Marshall Law, the New World Order, the Film Camp FEMA to our two guests, please.
[02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:57.618]  Then you can bring up some other side issue if you want, but 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to get on board with us.
[02:00:58.318 --> 02:00:59.680]  I did want to make two quick announcements.
[02:01:01.167 --> 02:01:07.853]  We've got a bunch of Don't Tread On Me Coal Pepper t-shirts that aren't just the snake on a yellow shirt.
[02:01:07.993 --> 02:01:09.594]  Other variants of it are coming in.
[02:01:11.276 --> 02:01:13.738]  And those new shirts coming in are going to be limited run.
[02:01:14.879 --> 02:01:20.083]  There's going to be, say, 1,500 of all sizes, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[02:01:20.964 --> 02:01:22.766]  Same thing with these Obama posters.
[02:01:24.421 --> 02:01:34.986]  We took the classic Obama Joker, put fascism, put New World Order, put InfoWars.com under it, and also improved on the image by more saturating it, making it look a little bit cleaner.
[02:01:35.606 --> 02:01:47.152]  We've got better images of him as the Joker and Bush as the Joker, so those are going to be the only ones that are available in the next few weeks when we sell out of the classic Obama
[02:01:48.396 --> 02:01:48.836]  Joker.
[02:01:48.896 --> 02:01:50.077]  So it's limited edition.
[02:01:50.557 --> 02:02:00.082]  If you want to get your hands on InfoWars.com, in the Fed, that's what it says on the back, in the Fed on one shirt, the other shirt says arrest the criminal, stop the criminal.
[02:02:01.622 --> 02:02:03.703]  There's some that just say InfoWars.com.
[02:02:04.184 --> 02:02:10.687]  If you want one of these classic shirts, we're making them special by saying that when they're gone, they're gone and that's it.
[02:02:13.331 --> 02:02:21.918]  So I hope everybody gets them, because the media nationally has said it's racist, it's evil, it's bad, and you should be arrested if you put these up on light poles.
[02:02:21.938 --> 02:02:28.223]  Though, the State Attorney General said they're not going to charge the youth who put them up in one area of Florida.
[02:02:28.243 --> 02:02:33.006]  Because when they said they were about to arrest him, people put up hundreds of times.
[02:02:33.046 --> 02:02:34.367]  I mean, it's all over Florida.
[02:02:34.627 --> 02:02:41.653]  The Toronto Star told me Saturday when they called me, they said every road in the city has them.
[02:02:42.293 --> 02:02:42.614]  They said,
[02:02:43.775 --> 02:02:44.596]  Are you behind this?
[02:02:44.616 --> 02:02:45.257]  And I said, no.
[02:02:45.617 --> 02:02:46.378]  It's my idea.
[02:02:46.999 --> 02:02:47.820]  But I said, no.
[02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:50.223]  She said, I mean, did you hire hundreds of people?
[02:02:50.303 --> 02:02:50.844]  I said, no.
[02:02:51.444 --> 02:02:56.050]  People are mad that the media tried to censor them and said they couldn't put this image up.
[02:02:56.410 --> 02:02:57.312]  And this is only the beginning.
[02:02:57.532 --> 02:02:59.494]  So the Joker thing is out of control.
[02:02:59.855 --> 02:03:00.495]  It's awesome.
[02:03:00.876 --> 02:03:02.958]  It lets the system know they're not going to silence us.
[02:03:03.519 --> 02:03:10.082]  With the announcements of how the Pentagon's taking the web over to, quote, shut it down and to, quote, shut alternative blogs down.
[02:03:10.102 --> 02:03:12.183]  I mean, it's really happening.
[02:03:12.223 --> 02:03:14.505]  The Pentagon themselves say this.
[02:03:14.525 --> 02:03:17.606]  You know, they're freaking out in CNET News and the AP.
[02:03:17.666 --> 02:03:18.807]  It's much worse than this.
[02:03:20.388 --> 02:03:22.549]  The establishment is losing the hearts and minds.
[02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:23.669]  They're going to shut the web down.
[02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:27.851]  They're going to launch fake cyber attacks against the web and shut it down in the name of its safety.
[02:03:28.091 --> 02:03:29.392]  I've been telling you that for eight months.
[02:03:29.752 --> 02:03:30.793]  They're now saying it.
[02:03:31.273 --> 02:03:33.034]  They're now getting you ready to accept it.
[02:03:34.339 --> 02:03:34.541]  Show!
[02:03:36.434 --> 02:03:41.536]  Go get the ObamaInfoWars.com posters that are up on InfoWars.com in the contest area.
[02:03:41.816 --> 02:03:42.256]  Post them.
[02:03:42.716 --> 02:03:43.456]  I've gone out and do it.
[02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:50.939]  Don't let them chill your free speech, but more importantly, and I'm going to done plug in this, we have a contest running through Friday.
[02:03:51.599 --> 02:04:04.243]  And I may extend it a little bit, because I'm still getting videos of people putting up the Obama Joker, and I've gotten hundreds and hundreds, and it's over 300, Curt Nemo said, and that was a few days ago, of different ideas for poster art.
[02:04:05.043 --> 02:04:07.404]  We're having a contest for the best political poster.
[02:04:07.805 --> 02:04:11.266]  Anti-war, anti-vaccine, anti-fluoride, anti-chemtrail.
[02:04:12.807 --> 02:04:20.691]  It'll be whoever makes the best poster and on any subject will judge it on what gets the message across the best, not even what issue it is.
[02:04:21.552 --> 02:04:22.112]  I'm the judge.
[02:04:22.692 --> 02:04:23.413]  That's half of it.
[02:04:23.433 --> 02:04:33.098]  The other half is posting it in public and videotaping it and uploading it to YouTube or another major video site and sending it to contest at infowars.com.
[02:04:34.295 --> 02:04:37.798]  That is the contest, not the hundreds and hundreds of posters you're sending us.
[02:04:38.859 --> 02:04:41.121]  It needs to be posted in public.
[02:04:42.502 --> 02:04:43.764]  And videoed.
[02:04:44.324 --> 02:04:46.906]  So the message is, we're not just putting it up about Obama.
[02:04:48.608 --> 02:04:54.053]  A lot of people have made them with Obama and Bush next to each other, saying that they work for the New World Order.
[02:04:54.313 --> 02:04:55.554]  Two sides of the same coin.
[02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:56.475]  Very effective.
[02:04:58.061 --> 02:05:05.088]  Whatever, it's about showing the establishment that the people can take over the information war if we want to.
[02:05:05.569 --> 02:05:06.930]  That is now what's happening.
[02:05:07.271 --> 02:05:10.514]  So that said, this is why we need to put up more posters now than ever.
[02:05:11.375 --> 02:05:15.339]  Just don't do it on government property, meaning property the slaves can't touch.
[02:05:15.659 --> 02:05:17.962]  Meaning you pay the money and the government tells you how to live.
[02:05:19.272 --> 02:05:20.173]  All over Texas.
[02:05:20.613 --> 02:05:22.714]  They've called for my arrest.
[02:05:22.774 --> 02:05:24.295]  They've called it hate speech.
[02:05:24.955 --> 02:05:26.216]  Hays County, it's not illegal.
[02:05:26.236 --> 02:05:28.397]  They say it should be made illegal so I can be arrested.
[02:05:29.578 --> 02:05:32.259]  It's Spanish TV internationals calling for my arrest.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.821]  The TV here in the U.S.
[02:05:36.081 --> 02:05:36.802]  You've all seen it.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.042]  We boldly just said, bring it on, First Amendment.
[02:05:41.722 --> 02:05:44.084]  They were going to arrest this youth in Florida, the one guy.
[02:05:44.104 --> 02:05:47.786]  An Obama supporter came up and started taking photos saying, I'm reporting you.
[02:05:48.006 --> 02:05:48.947]  Like a body snatcher.
[02:05:49.267 --> 02:05:50.628]  I'm a Nazi, I'm reporting you.
[02:05:51.349 --> 02:05:52.029]  I'm going to get you.
[02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.850]  First Amendment's bad.
[02:05:52.890 --> 02:05:53.750]  Putting on a light pole.
[02:05:54.291 --> 02:05:55.952]  Obama supporters, rip them down everywhere.
[02:05:56.012 --> 02:05:56.953]  Put up ten times more.
[02:05:57.553 --> 02:06:01.576]  Here is a local newscast out of Northeast Texas, pretty big town.
[02:06:02.881 --> 02:06:11.624]  Well, they're acting like a murder's been committed, or a bank robbery's happened, and they're hyperventilating and freaking out, and, oh my God, the youth, it's so scary.
[02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:21.768]  Yeah, the public schools are pushing Ritalin, Prozac, SWAT teams, drug dogs, teaching people how to be petty and mindless, government brainwashing, dumbing them down.
[02:06:22.588 --> 02:06:25.850]  We teach them to respect the local authorities and the president.
[02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:29.211]  Thank God we ripped them down before the youth saw them.
[02:06:30.876 --> 02:06:31.677]  Oh, yeah, I think.
[02:06:32.177 --> 02:06:34.279]  And then they say it was antiwar.com.
[02:06:34.319 --> 02:06:35.620]  You can see the video at the school.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:37.122]  It says Infowars.com.
[02:06:37.482 --> 02:06:41.545]  So I guess they thought they would get me by not showing Infowars.com.
[02:06:41.906 --> 02:06:43.787]  It isn't about Infowars.com.
[02:06:44.208 --> 02:06:47.811]  It's about getting everybody to be active and to see the power you have.
[02:06:48.031 --> 02:06:51.114]  That's what Gandhi did for 20-plus years in India.
[02:06:51.434 --> 02:06:57.837]  That's what I'm doing is showing you the power you've got to stand up to these parasite trash!
[02:06:58.157 --> 02:07:01.038]  We're going to Franchi and everybody in a minute, but I wanted to get to this.
[02:07:02.119 --> 02:07:06.201]  Here's the local newscast out of KLTV as we analyze it.
[02:07:06.241 --> 02:07:06.661]  Here it is.
[02:07:08.722 --> 02:07:13.804]  ...depicting President Obama as the Joker started appearing in Tyler, Texas yesterday.
[02:07:14.325 --> 02:07:19.647]  The altered picture of the president was made by a college student and has since gone worldwide via YouTube.
[02:07:20.257 --> 02:07:23.658]  Up to 20 posters were put on trees, signs, and windows.
[02:07:24.098 --> 02:07:28.418]  The only message was the website address, Infowars.com.
[02:07:28.779 --> 02:07:36.380]  That's the online site for a syndicated radio talk show host who offered $1,000 to the person who puts up the most Obama Joker posters.
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:38.300]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:43.001]  The guys had no way to communicate it to me, and that's the old one from two weeks ago.
[02:07:43.801 --> 02:07:48.002]  The new one, if you see it, says video no longer available.
[02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:56.797]  And I think that got linked by Drudge, it probably crashed KLTV's site, but that one talked about how evil and bad it was at the school.
[02:07:57.637 --> 02:07:58.878]  So let's go to Gary Franchi.
[02:07:59.319 --> 02:08:13.332]  Gary, and again the producer of Camp FEMA, now available at Infowars.com, and William Lewis, I had you guys hold the last 6-7 minutes through that, because do you concur with what I'm saying, or do you have anything to add, or do you disagree?
[02:08:14.025 --> 02:08:16.107]  No, I'm actually... Oh, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:08:16.127 --> 02:08:19.230]  You know, I'm ready to go out and hit the streets myself.
[02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:21.432]  I drove down the street in my town.
[02:08:21.812 --> 02:08:23.814]  I saw this beautiful line of trees.
[02:08:23.874 --> 02:08:24.414]  I'm like, you know what?
[02:08:24.574 --> 02:08:27.837]  Every single tree needs a no-vaccine sign.
[02:08:28.518 --> 02:08:31.480]  And, you know, I'm ready to go down to Kinko's, put up a whole bunch and do it myself.
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:33.202]  So, I think it needs to be done.
[02:08:34.841 --> 02:08:35.362]  Absolutely.
[02:08:35.382 --> 02:08:42.971]  In fact, I saw a newscast freaking out in Temple about somebody putting up 10penny.com, the doctor, and saying, you know, vaccines are killing you.
[02:08:43.051 --> 02:08:45.373]  And doctors going, don't say that, it's lies.
[02:08:45.614 --> 02:08:47.316]  The Gardasil's killed a bunch of people.
[02:08:47.776 --> 02:08:49.718]  They admit the flu shot test in Europe.
[02:08:50.259 --> 02:08:50.760]  I got it wrong.
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:52.701]  Not the U.S., but in Europe killed some people.
[02:08:52.942 --> 02:08:57.146]  I mean, Google, flu vaccine kills in Europe.
[02:08:57.186 --> 02:08:58.767]  I mean, it was London Telegraph.
[02:08:59.248 --> 02:09:02.991]  So, yeah, they're telling us we can't go out and put something up.
[02:09:03.271 --> 02:09:05.494]  We've got to just sit here and accept their propaganda.
[02:09:06.595 --> 02:09:07.816]  It's ridiculous.
[02:09:07.896 --> 02:09:10.258]  It's time for the American people to rise up.
[02:09:10.799 --> 02:09:14.042]  And, you know, I'm listening to you on this end, and I'm getting fired up.
[02:09:14.082 --> 02:09:15.323]  I'm jumping out of my seat, you know.
[02:09:16.171 --> 02:09:18.393]  And I hope that everyone else listening is feeling the same way.
[02:09:18.413 --> 02:09:19.414]  It's time to stand up.
[02:09:19.754 --> 02:09:20.795]  It's time to rise up.
[02:09:21.116 --> 02:09:22.557]  You will not find me in a FEMA camp.
[02:09:22.837 --> 02:09:23.998]  You will not find me there.
[02:09:25.259 --> 02:09:27.281]  Well, that's the thing about the film you and William have made.
[02:09:27.301 --> 02:09:29.323]  It's just amazing because it covers everything.
[02:09:29.383 --> 02:09:36.649]  It proves the history of it, how they operate, the police state, the demonization of dissidents that go with it, the COINTELPRO feds.
[02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:38.911]  I mean, you guys have knocked it out of the park, Gary.
[02:09:39.792 --> 02:09:42.795]  Alex, I am a God-blessed American citizen.
[02:09:43.453 --> 02:09:49.140]  And I will be, I am so fed up with these elitists.
[02:09:59.431 --> 02:10:14.836]  It's an attempt to chill free speech, as you know, and it's an attempt to shut you down and to make everybody scared to have political speech, just like when they say criticizing Obama is the N-word.
[02:10:15.276 --> 02:10:18.157]  I mean, they are brutally trying to silence free speech.
[02:10:18.438 --> 02:10:19.498]  William Lewis, comments.
[02:10:21.459 --> 02:10:22.760]  Well, yeah, here we go again.
[02:10:23.361 --> 02:10:27.947]  I think that the poster idea is a great idea of what Gary was saying, too, about the no vaccination.
[02:10:29.468 --> 02:10:32.931]  You know, those are some of the issues that are dealt with in the documentary.
[02:10:32.971 --> 02:10:44.402]  We try not to get really specific and say that, you know, this is exactly what they're going to do with swine flu, because we've seen this happen before with anthrax and smallpox and, you know, back in 2000 and 2003 when they wanted to vaccinate us then.
[02:10:44.822 --> 02:10:52.530]  But this is a very real scenario, and if we go ahead and start educating people through these posters that we can put up in people's neighborhoods or, you know, wherever you want to,
[02:10:53.773 --> 02:10:56.199]  That, I think, is a great way to go.
[02:10:56.239 --> 02:11:00.190]  Maybe put a website at the bottom if they can get some information on it.
[02:11:01.684 --> 02:11:02.484]  Absolutely.
[02:11:03.105 --> 02:11:08.947]  I want to continue getting into Camp FEMA, but I do want to go to Vincent in Virginia, Sam in the Netherlands, and others that are holding.
[02:11:08.987 --> 02:11:16.329]  But, Gary, I think Camp FEMA is going to really be effective, and that's why I'm asking my listeners to get it, to pre-order it today.
[02:11:16.349 --> 02:11:17.370]  It comes out in two weeks.
[02:11:18.150 --> 02:11:20.771]  And to show it to everybody, have viewing parties.
[02:11:21.091 --> 02:11:29.574]  Are you wanting this to be like some of the other films, like Freedom to Fascism, that you're the steward of, that are meant to be virally distributed?
[02:11:30.478 --> 02:11:31.719]  Well, we want them to get out there.
[02:11:31.739 --> 02:11:32.760]  We want the people to see them.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.900]  We want the viewing parties.
[02:11:34.641 --> 02:11:42.666]  You know, the film is copyrighted, so we know we can't produce more films unless people get them, but we're going to provide a bulk system in the future.
[02:11:44.087 --> 02:11:48.170]  Absolutely, and we'll be part of that at InfoWars.com, but they should have viewing parties and show them to everybody.
[02:11:49.165 --> 02:11:49.565]  Absolutely.
[02:11:50.005 --> 02:11:50.486]  Absolutely.
[02:11:50.526 --> 02:11:51.926]  The word has to get out, Alex.
[02:11:52.426 --> 02:11:52.666]  All right.
[02:11:52.706 --> 02:11:53.166]  Stay there.
[02:11:53.206 --> 02:11:56.848]  We'll be right back with Gary Franchi and, of course, William Lewis.
[02:11:56.908 --> 02:11:58.108]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:11:58.628 --> 02:11:59.088]  Gold.
[02:11:59.429 --> 02:12:00.709]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:12:00.949 --> 02:12:07.051]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:12:07.231 --> 02:12:11.052]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:12:11.413 --> 02:12:13.293]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:12:13.353 --> 02:12:15.574]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:12:15.794 --> 02:12:16.475]  We're good to go.
[02:12:38.656 --> 02:12:44.278]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report of Fed hopes you'll never see.
[02:12:44.578 --> 02:12:47.139]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:53.502]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[02:12:53.662 --> 02:12:54.683]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:12:58.924 --> 02:13:06.426]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:13:06.446 --> 02:13:08.067]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:13:08.167 --> 02:13:14.689]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:13:24.342 --> 02:13:29.658]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:31.623]  An inside job.
[02:13:32.998 --> 02:13:34.079]  How dare you?
[02:13:35.441 --> 02:13:40.505]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:13:40.525 --> 02:13:42.828]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:13:42.868 --> 02:13:49.854]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[02:13:49.895 --> 02:13:52.477]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:13:52.757 --> 02:13:54.739]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:13:54.999 --> 02:13:57.462]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:13:58.496 --> 02:13:58.897]  I think so.
[02:14:19.448 --> 02:14:20.389]  We're good to go.
[02:14:43.404 --> 02:14:52.489]  For years doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[02:15:07.116 --> 02:15:16.701]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[02:15:17.021 --> 02:15:25.465]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium, along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.
[02:15:25.765 --> 02:15:31.328]  Unlike other products, AlkaZone is odorless and tasteless, and can be added to any beverage to offset its acidity.
[02:15:31.588 --> 02:15:38.292]  AlkaZone also manufactures antioxidant water fountains that will both filter and raise the pH of the tap water in your home to a pH of 10.

[02:16:15.429 --> 02:16:18.292]  In fact, I printed this off this weekend and forgot to bring it.
[02:16:18.312 --> 02:16:24.739]  Well, you guys print me off Wikipedia and actually had read this in a book about Benjamin Franklin.
[02:16:26.055 --> 02:16:27.015]  So I know it's accurate.
[02:16:27.376 --> 02:16:38.580]  I don't just believe what I see on Wikipedia about why we have the Gadsden flag or the symbol of the rattlesnake being one of the first symbols of this country even before the bald eagle.
[02:16:40.241 --> 02:16:43.502]  And I think the founders explained it quite well.
[02:16:45.503 --> 02:16:49.004]  Because we're not looking for trouble, but we're not going to your FEMA camps, we're not your slaves.
[02:16:49.344 --> 02:16:59.166]  Let's take calls for Gary Franchi, the producer, co-producer, with William Lewis, the director of Camp FEMA, now available, first day, at Infowars.com, out of the gates.
[02:16:59.766 --> 02:17:02.246]  We have it comboed up with the Obama Deception and other films.
[02:17:03.067 --> 02:17:05.807]  Let's talk to Vincent in Virginia, then Sam in the Netherlands.
[02:17:06.087 --> 02:17:07.327]  Vincent, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:17:07.908 --> 02:17:08.488]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:17:09.288 --> 02:17:14.769]  Yeah, I just had one more question for Gary or William or whoever wanted to comment.
[02:17:15.544 --> 02:17:27.784]  I have an aunt whose father was a German immigrant during World War II and when he came over he was apparently detained by the FBI for two or three days for questioning.
[02:17:28.762 --> 02:17:32.664]  Just to make sure he wasn't a Nazi operative or something of that sort.
[02:17:32.704 --> 02:17:33.364]  Oh, that's nothing.
[02:17:33.384 --> 02:17:41.407]  They put tens of thousands of German citizens in camps, Japanese, and then they stole the Japanese property in San Francisco and surrounding areas.
[02:17:41.427 --> 02:17:44.488]  They were very wealthy, been here in some cases over 150 years.
[02:17:45.048 --> 02:17:47.349]  Because, you know, Japan's in the Pacific.
[02:17:47.969 --> 02:17:52.731]  I mean, you talk to these guys like talking to an American, and they rape their women, everything else.
[02:17:52.991 --> 02:17:54.772]  They put Italian-Americans in camps.
[02:17:54.832 --> 02:17:55.172]  Go ahead.
[02:17:56.581 --> 02:18:03.685]  Yeah, I was just going to ask, how do you, I mean, what do you find if you're looking at these camps?
[02:18:03.785 --> 02:18:15.710]  I can't imagine it's easy to get inside of them to tell that it's made for, supposedly for, say, illegal immigrants or possible terrorists versus American citizens.
[02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.871]  I mean, how do you tell?
[02:18:16.891 --> 02:18:18.531]  Here's the thing.
[02:18:19.352 --> 02:18:24.394]  The Japanese internment camps were not even built when they were rounded up.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:34.084]  When I spoke to internment camp survivor Sam Ozaki, a Japanese-American, born in the United States, just like us, citizen.
[02:18:35.165 --> 02:18:39.947]  He was rounded up, bussed off to these camps, but the camps, like I said, they weren't built.
[02:18:40.407 --> 02:18:52.053]  They used stadiums, they used amusement parks, fairgrounds, just large public facilities and held in there while the camps were being constructed.
[02:18:53.376 --> 02:18:55.517]  And Gary, that's exactly what I explained to you.
[02:18:55.857 --> 02:19:06.964]  If you look at top-off and NLE exercises, they practice putting you in sports stadiums, putting you in facilities, then they bus groups of you off, and then they make you build the camp you're going to live in.
[02:19:07.604 --> 02:19:08.104]  Exactly.
[02:19:08.264 --> 02:19:15.288]  And, you know, the gentleman's asking, what makes a, what are the specific characteristics of a FEMA camp?
[02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:19.891]  Well, you know, hey, next time you drive past your high school, look at the fences.
[02:19:20.638 --> 02:19:25.101]  Imagine everyone rounded up inside the fences in your high school stadium.
[02:19:25.501 --> 02:19:25.802]  Okay?
[02:19:26.322 --> 02:19:27.183]  It's as simple as that.
[02:19:27.563 --> 02:19:28.884]  We're taking it a step further.
[02:19:28.904 --> 02:19:34.468]  I mean, they were using churches in Chicago to hold German immigrants.
[02:19:35.828 --> 02:19:44.955]  They have the actual prison cubes, the concrete prison cubes, that they can drop like Legos and build them up overnight.
[02:19:45.817 --> 02:19:47.759]  And the feds, I mean, look, this is not our opinion.
[02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:51.463]  They admit, and they're setting it up where you're going to want to be in the camp.
[02:19:51.844 --> 02:19:56.649]  Like, oh, you're starving, you want to be, you're not allowed to be homeless now, you've got to live in the camp.
[02:19:59.212 --> 02:20:01.913]  Yes, so the film breaks it down.
[02:20:01.933 --> 02:20:07.256]  You know, obviously there's the inward facing barbed wire, the guard towers.
[02:20:07.316 --> 02:20:10.937]  I mean, these are staples of standard camps that are existing today.
[02:20:10.957 --> 02:20:16.700]  But what's most importantly is, you know, they can build these camps overnight, within 24 hours.
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:22.582]  Look, on record, the feds built the Robert Mueller Airport, and they have a large area designated.
[02:20:22.642 --> 02:20:24.023]  I have local news admitting it.
[02:20:25.458 --> 02:20:30.501]  I mean, they take facilities that have barbed wire, and that's the camp, and there's guys with machine guns there.
[02:20:30.541 --> 02:20:30.941]  Go ahead.
[02:20:33.123 --> 02:20:33.903]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[02:20:34.023 --> 02:20:35.704]  You're seeing it right there.
[02:20:35.764 --> 02:20:41.388]  The camp, they've taken existing camps from the Clinton administration.
[02:20:41.528 --> 02:20:44.650]  When they decommissioned all those military bases, they converted those camps.
[02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:49.052]  They've converted countless other locations across the country.
[02:20:49.072 --> 02:20:53.495]  The civilian inmate labor program, as Alex was talking with us on the break,
[02:20:54.628 --> 02:20:55.828]  There's a lot of characteristics.
[02:20:55.889 --> 02:20:57.029]  Check out the film for yourself.
[02:20:57.989 --> 02:21:02.151]  And the federal bill tries to legalize and fund what's already set up.
[02:21:02.291 --> 02:21:15.456]  Everything we always said the camps were and how they worked is mirrored in the congressional bill that says the old military bases, barbed wire, local police involved, army running it, a brig, family living areas.
[02:21:15.476 --> 02:21:18.457]  I mean, this is already happening in plain view.
[02:21:19.377 --> 02:21:19.677]  HR 645.
[02:21:20.018 --> 02:21:21.278]  Right there.
[02:21:23.079 --> 02:21:23.699]  Take a look at it.
[02:21:24.281 --> 02:21:27.864]  Meanwhile, Media Matters just say it doesn't exist.
[02:21:27.904 --> 02:21:28.305]  Stay there.
[02:21:28.725 --> 02:21:33.549]  I hope that answers your question, Vincent, Sam, Virgil, Tony, Abel, Jeff and others.
[02:21:33.569 --> 02:21:34.350]  Your call's coming up.
[02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:37.052]  But first, I want to hear... I've been asking the questions here.
[02:21:37.072 --> 02:21:42.116]  I want Gary Franchi and William Lewis just to make any comments they want about their film.
[02:21:42.937 --> 02:21:43.538]  Camp FEMA.
[02:21:44.118 --> 02:21:45.079]  Infowars.com.
[02:21:48.802 --> 02:21:49.683]  We're on the march.
[02:21:50.183 --> 02:21:51.685]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:52.697 --> 02:21:55.438]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.199 --> 02:22:02.180]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:22:02.441 --> 02:22:04.241]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:22:04.441 --> 02:22:12.724]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:22:12.964 --> 02:22:18.186]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:22:18.506 --> 02:22:20.127]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:22:20.367 --> 02:22:26.690]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:22:26.890 --> 02:22:37.635]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:22:37.935 --> 02:22:38.395]  That's right.
[02:22:38.695 --> 02:22:41.017]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:22:41.277 --> 02:22:42.999]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:22:43.079 --> 02:22:43.279]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:22:43.339 --> 02:22:45.701]  Or visit a Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:22:45.921 --> 02:22:46.542]  That's Ecolablue.com.
[02:22:58.114 --> 02:22:59.235]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:22:59.496 --> 02:23:01.298]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:23:01.498 --> 02:23:02.179]  Well, you should.
[02:23:02.479 --> 02:23:06.724]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:23:06.984 --> 02:23:07.465]  That's right.
[02:23:07.785 --> 02:23:16.255]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:23:16.455 --> 02:23:17.696]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:23:17.796 --> 02:23:18.958]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:23:19.138 --> 02:23:24.782]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:23:25.122 --> 02:23:31.646]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:23:32.026 --> 02:23:37.230]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:38.691]  This is real.
[02:23:39.011 --> 02:23:39.751]  Don't miss out.
[02:23:40.071 --> 02:23:46.936]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:23:47.156 --> 02:23:48.439]  And get your free handgun.
[02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:50.803]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:23:50.983 --> 02:23:54.490]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:23:54.691 --> 02:23:57.616]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:23:58.482 --> 02:24:03.445]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[02:24:03.665 --> 02:24:06.067]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[02:24:06.227 --> 02:24:15.772]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[02:24:15.913 --> 02:24:21.796]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[02:24:22.096 --> 02:24:24.618]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[02:24:24.798 --> 02:24:27.179]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:28.500]  We're good.
[02:24:50.999 --> 02:24:52.340]  OwnMyself.com.
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:53.561]  It takes very little money.
[02:24:53.682 --> 02:24:56.084]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[02:24:56.264 --> 02:24:58.226]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.
[02:25:10.477 --> 02:25:13.580]  The establishment sees the Republic as a snake.
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:15.602]  They want to cut the head off of the snake.
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:24.464]  But in each of us, in each of our hearts, lives the spirit of 1776 and true liberty and virtue and freedom against tyranny.
[02:25:25.645 --> 02:25:26.426]  So activate!
[02:25:26.526 --> 02:25:28.227]  Get involved in the Info War today!
[02:25:28.327 --> 02:25:29.067]  Spread the word!
[02:25:29.607 --> 02:25:33.650]  We outnumber the enemy a thousand to one, but if we stand here idle, we will lose.
[02:25:35.467 --> 02:25:39.289]  I wanted, yeah there's a shot of the Gadsden flag, the Gadsden flag t-shirt we have available.
[02:25:39.309 --> 02:25:47.592]  It has the Thomas Jefferson quote on the back about the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:25:48.472 --> 02:25:50.793]  The famous yellow flag with the snake on it.
[02:25:52.774 --> 02:25:59.917]  The Marine Corps was the first to use it in South Carolina while engaging British ships, in some cases 10 to 1.
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:06.788]  It's now demonized by the Department of Homeland Security as a symbol of terrorism.
[02:26:08.492 --> 02:26:10.896]  But I wanted to read to you what the founders said.
[02:26:14.381 --> 02:26:21.127]  In 1754, during the French and Indian War, Franklin published his famous woodcut of a snake cut into eight sections.
[02:26:21.607 --> 02:26:26.911]  It represented the colonies, with New England joined together at the head and the South Carolina at the tail.
[02:26:27.552 --> 02:26:32.636]  Following their order along the coast, under the snake, the message was, join or die.
[02:26:32.656 --> 02:26:36.999]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, this was then used early on in the Revolutionary War.
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:41.363]  So, that's when the rattlesnake was first seen, then it was picked up in 1776 by the Marines.
[02:26:43.925 --> 02:26:44.826]  By the Marine Corps.
[02:26:46.206 --> 02:26:53.951]  And writing then, as the American Revolution grew closer, the snake began to see more use as a symbol for the colonies.
[02:26:54.271 --> 02:26:55.692]  It's the true symbol of America.
[02:26:56.213 --> 02:27:04.978]  In 1774, Paul Revere added it to the title of his paper, The Massachusetts Spy, as a snake joined to fight a British dragon.
[02:27:05.538 --> 02:27:11.122]  In December of 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the Pennsylvania Journal,
[02:27:16.528 --> 02:27:20.951]  Under the pseudonym, American Gossar.
[02:27:22.232 --> 02:27:25.074]  They're doing some audio testing in there today with the new audio system.
[02:27:25.094 --> 02:27:27.897]  I don't know if people are hearing that on air, but it's hard for me to talk with it doing that.
[02:27:27.917 --> 02:27:29.218]  I'm going to start over now.
[02:27:30.298 --> 02:27:31.239]  Try as hard as I can here.
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:38.144]  As the American Revolution grew closer, the snake began to see more and more use as a symbol of the colonies.
[02:27:38.164 --> 02:27:45.710]  In 1774, Paul Revere added it to the title of his paper, The Massachusetts Spy, as a snake joined to fight a British dragon.
[02:27:48.325 --> 02:27:59.271]  In December 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the Pennsylvania Journal under the pseudonym American Goss Air, in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol of the American spirit.
[02:28:01.352 --> 02:28:04.774]  This is Benjamin Franklin, now known as a terrorist by Homeland Security, literally.
[02:28:04.874 --> 02:28:07.796]  I have him on video being demonized by Homeland Security.
[02:28:08.977 --> 02:28:09.257]  FEMA.
[02:28:09.817 --> 02:28:10.878]  I recollect that
[02:28:12.196 --> 02:28:18.981]  Her eyes excelled in brightness that of any other animal, and that she has no eyelids.
[02:28:19.421 --> 02:28:22.443]  She may therefore be esteemed as an emblem of vigilance.
[02:28:23.024 --> 02:28:23.964]  See, eternally awake.
[02:28:24.505 --> 02:28:27.027]  She never begins an attack.
[02:28:27.767 --> 02:28:28.768]  See, this describes us.
[02:28:28.788 --> 02:28:29.709]  This describes me.
[02:28:29.749 --> 02:28:31.230]  This describes my spirit.
[02:28:31.650 --> 02:28:35.533]  She never begins an attack, nor, once engaged,
[02:28:37.242 --> 02:28:38.064]  ever surrenders.
[02:28:38.565 --> 02:28:46.785]  She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage as if anxious to prevent all
[02:28:47.878 --> 02:28:55.182]  Pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapon which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth.
[02:28:55.822 --> 02:29:01.185]  So that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be most defenseless animal.
[02:29:01.725 --> 02:29:08.828]  And even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible.
[02:29:09.789 --> 02:29:14.051]  But their wounds, however small, are decisive and fatal.
[02:29:15.356 --> 02:29:21.417]  Conscience this, of this, she never wounds till she has been grievously given notice.
[02:29:22.338 --> 02:29:23.678]  And generally given notice.
[02:29:24.258 --> 02:29:25.338]  Even to her enemy.
[02:29:26.239 --> 02:29:29.479]  And cautioned him against the danger of treading on her.
[02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:36.261]  Was I wrong sir in thinking that a strong picture of the temper of the conduct of America.
[02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:41.451]  That's what the Gadsden flag is for all you sickening degenerate traitors.
[02:29:41.752 --> 02:29:43.753]  I was wearing one out in L.A.
[02:29:43.793 --> 02:29:51.299]  and people were shrinking in fear because I guess they'd seen it on the news and asking what it was and, and, and, and what's the shirt?
[02:29:53.361 --> 02:29:53.901]  Freedom!
[02:29:54.341 --> 02:29:55.943]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now and go back.
[02:29:56.223 --> 02:29:58.605]  Gary Franchi, William Lewis, you have the floor.
[02:29:59.005 --> 02:30:02.568]  Your points about your new film, Camp FEMA.
[02:30:03.488 --> 02:30:05.570]  You know, the film itself, Alex,
[02:30:07.304 --> 02:30:11.465]  There's a segment on there with Chuck Baldwin talking about the BIAC report.
[02:30:11.925 --> 02:30:13.065]  Okay, I'm staying there.
[02:30:13.105 --> 02:30:14.746]  I'm listening to Chuck.
[02:30:14.926 --> 02:30:19.727]  You know, we're getting his feedback on being labeled a practical terrorist.
[02:30:19.747 --> 02:30:21.327]  You know, that's in the film.
[02:30:21.667 --> 02:30:34.851]  You know, I sat down with an internment camp survivor for 60 minutes, and he shared his heart-wrenching story of how he had to only gather up what he could carry with his bare hands and bring into the camp an American citizen.
[02:30:35.671 --> 02:30:35.911]  Okay?
[02:30:37.236 --> 02:30:39.577]  That's in the film.
[02:30:40.277 --> 02:30:42.418]  The evidence is there.
[02:30:42.898 --> 02:30:44.619]  The pictures are there.
[02:30:45.359 --> 02:30:46.240]  It's all there, Alex.
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:49.301]  And it's terrifying, but it's true.
[02:30:49.321 --> 02:30:51.222]  The American people need to see it.
[02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:55.183]  Anyway, William, take the floor please.
[02:30:55.263 --> 02:30:56.444]  I can't take the floor.
[02:30:56.724 --> 02:31:04.327]  I think beyond all the legislation that we're talking about and the mindset and the documentation that we show that our, you know, Senate
[02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:11.607]  There's one thing we haven't talked about, and that's the 2010 census, which is coming up this next year.
[02:31:11.667 --> 02:31:18.514]  No one is mentioning the fact that in 1940, the government collected census information from the Census Bureau and used it.
[02:31:30.993 --> 02:31:32.073]  I think so.
[02:31:50.638 --> 02:31:51.179]  I don't know.
[02:32:08.373 --> 02:32:08.734]  I think so.
[02:32:25.356 --> 02:32:27.339]  This is what they want to do with the American people.
[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:34.870]  And I'm not telling you not to answer any questions from the 2,000 census taker that comes to your door, but, you know, you have to be your own judge.
[02:32:34.890 --> 02:32:41.180]  You have to decide whether you're going to say there's three people living in this house, or you're going to sit down and fill out 28 page form that says whether you own a firearm or not.
[02:32:42.083 --> 02:32:48.610]  And by the way, they've already, phase one last year, we would tell people this eight, nine months ago, and they didn't believe us.
[02:32:48.650 --> 02:32:49.771]  Now it's national news.
[02:32:50.091 --> 02:32:51.493]  They come and mark your front door.
[02:32:51.513 --> 02:32:53.255]  Phase two is now beginning.
[02:32:53.295 --> 02:32:55.917]  They have at least, that we know of, ten different surveys.
[02:32:56.538 --> 02:32:58.960]  One has ten questions, another has forty-nine.
[02:32:59.921 --> 02:33:01.803]  One of them has over two hundred questions.
[02:33:02.404 --> 02:33:04.746]  I got the forty-something question one.
[02:33:05.607 --> 02:33:08.548]  And this happened in 2000, now it's happening to my neighbors again.
[02:33:08.608 --> 02:33:11.689]  They come to your door and threaten you with a plastic badge.
[02:33:11.949 --> 02:33:13.169]  You have a Fifth Amendment.
[02:33:14.049 --> 02:33:16.210]  Gary Francia, you want to tell folks what the Fifth Amendment is?
[02:33:18.730 --> 02:33:24.032]  We have the right to be secure in our persons, in our homes, in our effects.
[02:33:24.572 --> 02:33:25.932]  They don't have the right to come up.
[02:33:26.572 --> 02:33:28.833]  If we don't want to answer the door, we don't have to answer the door.
[02:33:30.276 --> 02:33:40.945]  You know, recent information has been revealed to me that they are considering having a question in the census that says, do you own a firearm or not?
[02:33:40.985 --> 02:33:41.286]  No, no, no.
[02:33:41.306 --> 02:33:42.006]  That is in there.
[02:33:42.066 --> 02:33:43.387]  That was in the news in 2000.
[02:33:44.088 --> 02:33:46.410]  One of the census forms says, do you own firearms?
[02:33:46.470 --> 02:33:47.591]  No, I actually got it.
[02:33:47.971 --> 02:33:49.332]  There's videos of it on the web in 2000.
[02:33:49.473 --> 02:33:50.453]  No, no, no.
[02:33:50.874 --> 02:33:51.534]  It's there, Gary.
[02:33:52.235 --> 02:33:52.535]  It's there.
[02:33:52.876 --> 02:33:53.356]  Oh, God.
[02:33:55.165 --> 02:34:01.107]  Well, you understand though, they have an American Business Forum, they have an American Community Survey.
[02:34:01.847 --> 02:34:04.308]  There's ten of them on their website they admit to.
[02:34:05.128 --> 02:34:08.149]  I mean, I got one asking, do you have a low flush toilet?
[02:34:08.409 --> 02:34:09.770]  Do you have stocks and bonds?
[02:34:09.930 --> 02:34:10.590]  What are they?
[02:34:11.986 --> 02:34:21.109]  And again, under federal law, they can only ask how many people live here to apportion the number of congressmen your state get.
[02:34:21.929 --> 02:34:26.510]  Because California has the most, Texas second, Florida third, New York fourth.
[02:34:27.851 --> 02:34:28.951]  That's all it's for!
[02:34:29.451 --> 02:34:32.832]  Not, you know, what stocks and bonds do you have?
[02:34:32.892 --> 02:34:33.992]  We have a Fifth Amendment.
[02:34:34.212 --> 02:34:36.213]  We don't have to answer the police questions.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:42.360]  It's time.
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.381]  The American people need to rise up.
[02:34:44.421 --> 02:34:45.221]  They are rising up.
[02:34:45.941 --> 02:34:48.282]  People are going to town hall meetings all across the country.
[02:34:48.522 --> 02:34:50.803]  There's a town hall meeting in Skokie, Jan Schakowsky.
[02:34:51.263 --> 02:34:54.304]  Everyone, if you're in the Chicago area, go out there and give her hell!
[02:34:54.905 --> 02:34:58.346]  We're not going to take this socialist agenda coming down from on high.
[02:34:58.626 --> 02:35:01.827]  We are going to preserve and protect the United States of America.
[02:35:01.847 --> 02:35:03.748]  Stand up now!
[02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:06.329]  Gary, you were telling me during a break about how
[02:35:07.449 --> 02:35:11.651]  Remember in Texas, they said the Lloyd Doggett thing was fake, and then now they have to admit it's not fake.
[02:35:11.691 --> 02:35:17.433]  The citizens are mad at the congressman and how they threw the first few women and men out, but then that made everybody else come out.
[02:35:17.954 --> 02:35:22.556]  Just like they were trying to arrest people putting up the Obama posters, but now they've had to back off.
[02:35:22.596 --> 02:35:27.338]  They realize that we run this country, and if we'll just exercise it, it's over.
[02:35:27.398 --> 02:35:28.678]  Gary Franchi, William Lewis.
[02:35:28.978 --> 02:35:29.999]  Comments, then we're going to calls.
[02:35:30.905 --> 02:35:34.666]  You know, that lady that was demonized by the mainstream media.
[02:35:34.886 --> 02:35:38.507]  She was demonized because she stood up and held a birth certificate to her congressman.
[02:35:38.947 --> 02:35:39.347]  You know what?
[02:35:39.727 --> 02:35:41.248]  What that did, that backfired on them.
[02:35:41.628 --> 02:35:50.110]  Because when they put that out across the country, when they put that out on all the mainstream media reports, and they demonized her, the good people of America saw that for what it was.
[02:35:50.430 --> 02:35:54.251]  And now they're coming out to all the town halls, and she was the example of that.
[02:35:54.531 --> 02:35:56.072]  And now everybody else is standing up.
[02:35:56.352 --> 02:35:57.772]  That woman is the American hero.
[02:35:58.703 --> 02:36:02.064]  That woman is an American hero, and everybody else needs to stand up just like her.
[02:36:02.764 --> 02:36:03.264]  It's time.
[02:36:04.404 --> 02:36:16.007]  And that's the key, and I want William to comment on this, and we're going to calls from the Netherlands and beyond, is that I've always said the last illusion to fall is that we as patriots are a minority.
[02:36:16.447 --> 02:36:25.389]  And as the people put up posters and go to town halls and call into radio and go to city council and do all these things and start websites and all this be heard,
[02:36:26.209 --> 02:36:27.991]  If you're heard by one person, that's victory.
[02:36:28.531 --> 02:36:33.235]  That now everybody's seeing we're the majority and the system used to try to demonize us.
[02:36:33.555 --> 02:36:45.805]  Now they're not doing that as much because they realize, oh God, that only angers them because the mind control, the mesmerized trance that people were under is breaking.
[02:36:45.865 --> 02:36:46.426]  William Lewis.
[02:36:47.851 --> 02:36:52.394]  Yeah, people keep in mind that this country was born out of political dissent.
[02:36:52.874 --> 02:37:01.340]  You know, they may be labeling George Washington and the founders of this country as terrorists, but in the Crown's eyes, that's what they were.
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:04.202]  In the government's eyes, that's what we are.
[02:37:04.422 --> 02:37:05.963]  It doesn't make us in the wrong.
[02:37:06.183 --> 02:37:14.208]  In fact, I think it's quite an honor these days to be labeled a potential domestic terrorist because it says you're standing up and saying the right thing.
[02:37:14.807 --> 02:37:19.909]  So we can't let them intimidate us into not saying the things that need to be said.
[02:37:19.949 --> 02:37:22.010]  And this woman, like Gary said, is a hero.
[02:37:22.050 --> 02:37:23.490]  We need to all be standing up.
[02:37:23.530 --> 02:37:27.732]  We all need to be protesting what's going on in our government and speaking our mind.
[02:37:28.852 --> 02:37:31.273]  Well, I want to say something else and we are going to calls and it's this.
[02:37:34.402 --> 02:37:53.636]  In 99% of the cases, and I mean it's literally those type of numbers now, when we hear about somebody putting up an Obama poster, we hear about somebody going to a town hall, or somebody shoots the video of the town hall, or cops come over and say you can't have that anti-Obama poster but pro-posters are allowed, or somebody gets punched in the face and then stands up, it's my listeners.
[02:37:54.557 --> 02:38:03.790]  And I want to tell the listeners of this show, you are the second American revolution against the offshore banks tyranny and trying to usurp this country.
[02:38:04.210 --> 02:38:06.573]  You are the only resistance.
[02:38:06.714 --> 02:38:11.720]  You are wonderful and it is just such a blessing and such an honor.
[02:38:12.756 --> 02:38:23.919]  To be able to talk to people like you, and to be able to work with all these other great liberty activists, and to be the focal point show, and to have Media Matters and George Soros attacking me every day.
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:28.101]  It is such an honor, and I'm trying to live up to that standard.
[02:38:28.181 --> 02:38:29.081]  I know I'm not perfect.
[02:38:29.141 --> 02:38:32.122]  None of us have all the answers, but we don't have to be perfect.
[02:38:32.162 --> 02:38:33.502]  We just got to take action.
[02:38:33.843 --> 02:38:37.424]  We know these tyrants are out of control, and get the word out.
[02:38:37.744 --> 02:38:38.124]  Gentlemen,
[02:38:40.726 --> 02:38:46.031]  Alex, your listeners are a crucial, crucial part of this entire revolution.
[02:38:47.072 --> 02:38:48.093]  People are standing up.
[02:38:48.613 --> 02:38:49.755]  People have seen your films.
[02:38:49.795 --> 02:38:51.476]  They've seen Russell's film.
[02:38:51.957 --> 02:38:54.579]  They've participated in the Ron Paul revolution.
[02:38:54.599 --> 02:38:58.583]  This is the Second American Revolution, Alex.
[02:38:59.262 --> 02:39:00.803]  I am damn proud to be a part of it.
[02:39:01.143 --> 02:39:02.704]  I'm damn proud to be on your team.
[02:39:03.024 --> 02:39:08.146]  And if somebody wants to come out and demonize me because I stand up for what's right and for the Constitution, I say bring it.
[02:39:08.486 --> 02:39:10.327]  I say bring it with full force, because you know what?
[02:39:10.487 --> 02:39:12.868]  That's only going to galvanize me to step up.
[02:39:13.068 --> 02:39:15.029]  It's going to galvanize the people to step up.
[02:39:15.329 --> 02:39:17.049]  And that's what's happening right now.
[02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:23.752]  God bless America, and absolutely, and that's what's happening is people are realizing they have power.
[02:39:24.132 --> 02:39:31.114]  The system, when it attacks myself and Ron Paul and only a few other people, nationally now, that shows who the real enemy is.
[02:39:31.174 --> 02:39:41.878]  That shows that the whole eye of the New World Order is focused into the heart of its own empire, because if it can't keep its slaves in line, it fails, it falls.
[02:39:42.258 --> 02:39:45.859]  Sam in the Netherlands, you're on the air with William Lewis, the director.
[02:39:46.579 --> 02:39:59.344]  Hi Gary, I've met you before, emailed you in the past, and hi Alex and William.
[02:40:00.125 --> 02:40:13.190]  I would like to just say that my ancestor from South Africa was probably in the first concentration camp, and now there's a new concentration camp, it's big, it's called Palestine-Gaza, and Israel created
[02:40:13.783 --> 02:40:14.124]  I don't know.
[02:40:34.690 --> 02:40:35.571]  What else can I say?
[02:40:35.711 --> 02:40:37.272]  Well, I mean, I want to hear more of what you have to say.
[02:40:37.312 --> 02:40:38.132]  You make a great point.
[02:40:38.693 --> 02:40:39.753]  Look at South Africa.
[02:40:39.813 --> 02:40:41.234]  Look at some of the stuff Israel does.
[02:40:41.274 --> 02:40:43.416]  Look at what the Russians would do.
[02:40:43.736 --> 02:40:47.318]  They just lock off whole neighborhoods and don't let food and stuff in.
[02:40:47.338 --> 02:40:50.721]  And that's what they're saying under quarantine, which they're setting.
[02:40:50.741 --> 02:40:56.505]  This is the excuse for the feds to train locals to accept the lockdowns of cities, whether it happens or not.
[02:40:57.325 --> 02:40:59.106]  Is that that's how they work this.
[02:40:59.166 --> 02:41:00.207]  That's how this is done.
[02:41:00.567 --> 02:41:07.812]  Whole areas of the world are locked down and they're admitting they're turning all of America into a giant FEMA camp.
[02:41:08.032 --> 02:41:08.613]  William Lewis.
[02:41:10.578 --> 02:41:16.522]  Yeah, look, we went to, you know, the really cream of the crop when we wanted to ask these types of questions.
[02:41:16.582 --> 02:41:25.048]  I mean, obviously, you're in it, John Stackmiller's in it, Chuck Baldwin, Michael Batner, but, you know, one surprising person that we had in here is Catherine Bleich.
[02:41:28.243 --> 02:41:31.326]  Here in Missouri, she's head of the Liberty Restoration Project.
[02:41:31.346 --> 02:41:35.230]  She goes to these MIAC hearings and presents her evidence.
[02:41:35.310 --> 02:41:36.972]  I mean, she actually testifies at these things.
[02:41:37.352 --> 02:41:49.624]  We have her today at the MIAC hearing in Kansas City, entering into evidence the Camp FEMA documentary that these people, since it's been entered into evidence, are going to have to sit down and watch.
[02:41:50.256 --> 02:41:51.577]  We're very excited about that.
[02:41:51.617 --> 02:41:55.600]  Katherine is really carrying the banner of liberty and freedom here in Missouri.
[02:41:55.620 --> 02:41:57.201]  She needs to be supported.
[02:41:57.461 --> 02:42:10.770]  We've got Larry Pratt in this thing, Michael Shaw with Freedom Advocates, Charlie Meadows who gets off onto the Agenda 21, 85% reduction in population, that whole agenda, James Lane with We Are Change, Jeffrey Grubb,
[02:42:11.588 --> 02:42:16.252]  Uh, and of course, uh, you know, our-our star that we consider our star, uh, Sam Ozaki, who was the U.S.
[02:42:16.332 --> 02:42:25.700]  internment camp survivor, who's the guy who actually lived through this once before and is here to give us the warning signs, tell us what to look for, what they did to them, and how we can combat it.
[02:42:26.181 --> 02:42:29.604]  And that's where we get into, uh, that's where we get into the Tenth Amendment.
[02:42:29.624 --> 02:42:32.126]  State's right, like I said, this took place at, um...
[02:42:32.902 --> 02:42:35.823]  In Oklahoma City, this was a Freedom 21 conference.
[02:42:36.044 --> 02:42:41.146]  We've got the cream of the crop talking about this stuff, and I think people are going to be absolutely astounded.
[02:42:41.166 --> 02:42:42.807]  They're going to want to get up and take action.
[02:42:43.147 --> 02:42:44.748]  These guys present the right things to do.
[02:42:45.728 --> 02:42:46.489]  Beautiful job.
[02:42:46.509 --> 02:42:51.191]  We're going to come back, let Sam finish up, then Virgil, Tony, and a few other calls with our guest.
[02:42:52.011 --> 02:42:56.033]  It's Camp FEMA, available at InfoWars.com on DVD right now.
[02:42:56.113 --> 02:42:56.913]  Get your order in.
[02:42:57.114 --> 02:42:57.934]  Be the first to get it.
[02:42:58.885 --> 02:43:00.146]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:43:00.186 --> 02:43:05.529]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:43:05.789 --> 02:43:10.412]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:43:10.793 --> 02:43:15.876]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:43:16.376 --> 02:43:21.079]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:23.481]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:43:23.914 --> 02:43:28.517]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:43:28.717 --> 02:43:29.597]  And here's the best part.
[02:43:29.818 --> 02:43:32.599]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:43:32.899 --> 02:43:36.201]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:43:36.521 --> 02:43:39.363]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:43:39.703 --> 02:43:41.604]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:43:41.925 --> 02:43:42.785]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:43:42.805 --> 02:43:43.025]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:43:43.065 --> 02:43:44.186]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:43:53.001 --> 02:43:55.242]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:43:55.562 --> 02:43:57.983]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:43:59.484 --> 02:44:04.726]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:44:05.522 --> 02:44:10.884]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:44:11.404 --> 02:44:17.606]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:17.886 --> 02:44:19.726]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:19.886 --> 02:44:22.267]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:44:22.347 --> 02:44:33.230]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:44:35.527 --> 02:44:36.787]  It's not about left or right.
[02:44:37.187 --> 02:44:38.608]  It's about a one world government.
[02:44:39.048 --> 02:44:45.369]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:44:45.949 --> 02:44:53.731]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:54.211 --> 02:44:55.372]  The Obama Deception.
[02:44:55.792 --> 02:44:56.972]  The people strike back.
[02:44:58.598 --> 02:45:01.640]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[02:45:02.001 --> 02:45:06.224]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[02:45:06.444 --> 02:45:08.626]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[02:45:08.966 --> 02:45:14.931]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[02:45:15.231 --> 02:45:21.596]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[02:45:22.797 --> 02:45:24.798]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[02:45:25.038 --> 02:45:32.160]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits, sea vegetables, and antioxidants.
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:34.320]  You know, you work hard for your money.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:36.841]  Isn't it time to start getting what you pay for?
[02:45:37.161 --> 02:45:37.861]  Order today.
[02:45:37.881 --> 02:45:38.021]  1-800-210-1922.
[02:45:38.041 --> 02:45:40.962]  With Chews for Health, your body gets to keep the nutrients you swallow.
[02:45:45.023 --> 02:45:54.488]  The first 300 callers are going to receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[02:45:54.508 --> 02:45:54.828]  1-800-210-1922.
[02:45:54.968 --> 02:45:56.769]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[02:46:02.513 --> 02:46:04.794]  Alright, much as I love Merle Haggard, we're going to cut him off.
[02:46:07.195 --> 02:46:08.816]  And go right back to Sam in another one.
[02:46:08.876 --> 02:46:10.377]  Sam, anything else you wanted to add there?
[02:46:11.601 --> 02:46:15.602]  Yes, I have something to say also about, like, the Second World War.
[02:46:16.222 --> 02:46:18.682]  With the camps, the six million Jews, that's a hoax.
[02:46:19.702 --> 02:46:21.963]  And we've got to wake up to this, you know?
[02:46:21.983 --> 02:46:24.023]  What do you think?
[02:46:24.043 --> 02:46:37.485]  Well, you know, I've actually read the writings of Hitler and studied a lot of stuff, and I know the Russians have gone back on some of the stories they told, but, I mean, Hitler, I mean, you do believe he executed people and ran people into pits and shot them, right?
[02:46:37.665 --> 02:46:39.306]  Because that was the Nazis' own writings.
[02:46:39.466 --> 02:46:39.826]  Yes!
[02:46:40.546 --> 02:46:41.026]  He is!
[02:46:43.615 --> 02:46:43.815]  Yeah.
[02:46:44.175 --> 02:46:46.477]  All right, I appreciate your call, Sam.
[02:46:46.497 --> 02:46:47.237]  Good to hear from you.
[02:46:48.478 --> 02:46:55.603]  All these governments set up camps, and that's really the bottom line here.
[02:46:55.643 --> 02:46:58.745]  I mean, these camps are real being set up here in the United States.
[02:47:00.145 --> 02:47:06.950]  And it is true, the British invented camps actually didn't start in South Africa, though that's when it got modernized.
[02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:08.631]  The British invented camps.
[02:47:08.651 --> 02:47:11.773]  They had slave camps here in the U.S., prison ship camps.
[02:47:14.682 --> 02:47:17.203]  Andrew Jackson's mother and brother died in a camp.
[02:47:18.603 --> 02:47:19.644]  They just starved you to death.
[02:47:19.664 --> 02:47:20.584]  So the British invented them.
[02:47:20.924 --> 02:47:21.925]  Virgil in Ohio.
[02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:24.125]  You're on the air with the makers of the film Camp FEMA.
[02:47:24.165 --> 02:47:24.766]  Go ahead, Virgil.
[02:47:25.586 --> 02:47:26.306]  Oh, hello there.
[02:47:26.826 --> 02:47:27.086]  Hey!
[02:47:27.747 --> 02:47:30.288]  I don't know a whole lot about the FEMA camps.
[02:47:30.488 --> 02:47:31.308]  I'm just learning.
[02:47:32.708 --> 02:47:39.871]  And, uh, one, you was talking about an email or a website that I could go on.
[02:47:41.727 --> 02:47:45.668]  It's gonna be hard for you to listen if you got the radio cranked up and listen to yourself at the same time.
[02:47:46.349 --> 02:47:48.550]  No, actually my wife's got the computer on.
[02:47:48.810 --> 02:47:51.831]  Okay, well I just heard myself so it must have been, I must be going crazy.
[02:47:53.011 --> 02:47:54.892]  Specifically what website are you asking for?
[02:47:54.912 --> 02:48:05.536]  I'd like to know a little bit more about the FEMA camp and then the whole purpose of me calling today was I'm calling on behalf of my dad.
[02:48:06.136 --> 02:48:06.396]  Okay.
[02:48:07.290 --> 02:48:17.755]  And I was trying to get people to realize how evil the government's getting to even the people in offices locally, like in the state of Ohio where I live, what they're doing.
[02:48:18.255 --> 02:48:19.676]  What are they doing?
[02:48:19.696 --> 02:48:22.878]  And like the parole board, they're actually stealing men's lives.
[02:48:23.378 --> 02:48:28.200]  They're changing what they were put in for and then giving them more time.
[02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:33.983]  Yeah, I've seen that around the country where they add charges you were never convicted of
[02:48:35.487 --> 02:48:38.049]  Send me a local news article on that.
[02:48:38.129 --> 02:48:41.110]  Send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:48:41.130 --> 02:48:42.011]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[02:48:42.971 --> 02:48:46.934]  The film Camp FEMA covers all the documents.
[02:48:47.894 --> 02:48:49.535]  I'm in the film going over the documents.
[02:48:49.955 --> 02:48:51.856]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[02:48:53.177 --> 02:48:55.839]  Let me ask Gary Franchi and William Lewis this.
[02:48:55.859 --> 02:49:00.922]  Have you seen the clip of Fox Radio host Alan Combs saying,
[02:49:02.148 --> 02:49:11.074]  He doesn't even believe army.mil is a real website, so even when the government's trying to hire camp workers, they're saying it's not real.
[02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:12.791]  That's in the documentary.
[02:49:13.071 --> 02:49:15.814]  We found a clever way to introduce people to that.
[02:49:16.074 --> 02:49:23.320]  We've got Combs, his own words, on his radio program talking about it, saying that he can't find the army.mil website.
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:29.285]  And of course, at the same time, we are, you know, we've got a camera on the computer and we're going there physically shoving people.
[02:49:29.325 --> 02:49:30.005]  Yeah, it's real.
[02:49:30.526 --> 02:49:31.607]  So yeah, that's covered.
[02:49:32.127 --> 02:49:33.989]  And I think people will find that really funny.
[02:49:34.682 --> 02:49:36.163]  See, you did so much in this film.
[02:49:36.183 --> 02:49:37.443]  That's another thing I forgot about.
[02:49:37.704 --> 02:49:42.426]  You show folks how to Google it, and then you're on the Army site hiring people to run the camps.
[02:49:42.486 --> 02:49:45.667]  I mean, there's just so much denial going on out there.
[02:49:46.808 --> 02:49:56.172]  Well, I mean, it blew our minds when just a couple weeks ago, we got National Guard posting, you know, job postings for internment camp officers.
[02:49:56.573 --> 02:49:57.593]  You know, I called William up.
[02:49:57.653 --> 02:49:59.234]  I said, oh my God, you've got to see this.
[02:49:59.898 --> 02:50:00.198]  You know?
