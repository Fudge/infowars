[00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:29.439]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.822]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:36.904]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:42.047]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:43.188]  How much do you want?
[00:00:43.408 --> 00:00:44.168]  When do you want it?
[00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.130]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.250]  When will you need it?
[00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:49.552]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:50.813]  Will there be any food?
[00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:52.354]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.935]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:57.617]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:00.999]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.901]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.222]  How much will you need?
[00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:07.062]  We don't know.
[00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:08.263]  How much do you want?
[00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:09.204]  All you can get.
[00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:09.764]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:13.249]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:16.633]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:17.434]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.321]  ...named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:32.942]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:42.645]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:48.666]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.427]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:01:51.667 --> 00:02:01.392]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:12.196]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:16.298]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:17.579]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.200]  OwnMyself.com.
[00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:20.422]  It takes very little money.
[00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.964]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:25.686]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:31.892]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:34.495]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:02:48.038 --> 00:03:03.972]  Okay, we're about to go to the young man who has the State Attorney General's Office, according to the local news, and the Miami Herald, and the paper also in Orlando, preparing felony vandalism charges for putting him up on telephone poles.
[00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:08.656]  He's not the guy that put him up on the federal property.
[00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:13.621]  They admit that after the police visited with him, other people were putting up more.
[00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.265]  And in the town of Claremont, outside Orlando, that it just continues.
[00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.286]  And it's all over Orlando, all over Florida.
[00:03:20.727 --> 00:03:25.271]  It's in London, England, Tokyo, Japan, San Francisco, Los Angeles.
[00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:30.315]  People taking the InfoWars.com variant of the Obama Joker poster.
[00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:49.502]  Now, whenever I heard the media say a few weeks ago that people need to be arrested, that it's racist, that it's hateful, that... I said, wait a minute, Obama called for people in the Washington Post to put his hope change image made by the creator of the Andre's got a posse phenomenon in the last decade.
[00:03:49.742 --> 00:03:50.983]  Nobody ever called for his arrest.
[00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:54.005]  He called for his people to put it up on stop signs.
[00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:55.546]  We said follow the law.
[00:03:56.687 --> 00:03:59.970]  Though, most people didn't because they saw the hypocrisy of Obama.
[00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.590]  And we have a story up.
[00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.252]  Teenager at center of Obama Joker poster controversy.
[00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:13.197]  Police watched me post flyers and he said the cops told him yeah other people post stuff so we can't get you in trouble for this.
[00:04:13.938 --> 00:04:25.487]  But the media spun this and talked about victims and the community was scared and well here's a clip from the news from a montage of the San Francisco Joker poster contest
[00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:28.069]  Folks, I think you're probably going to be the winners.
[00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:29.650]  I'll be announcing that coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.976]  Here's a clip of a lady saying how scary it is and how horrifying and there are literally now more than 15 or so.
[00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:39.859]  I stopped counting it about different newscasts.
[00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:42.086]  I see new ones every day.
[00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:44.447]  I mean, they're in Chicago saying how scary it is.
[00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:52.692]  And, you know, the Palestinian kid who originally made the Joker poster without the socialism on it apologized and said it's evil and un-American.
[00:04:52.732 --> 00:04:58.596]  And people are in the local Austin papers and the town south of me saying it's wrong.
[00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.297]  Republicans are saying it's evil.
[00:05:00.657 --> 00:05:01.778]  It's terrorism.
[00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.119]  They're saying it's cultural terrorism.
[00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:10.103]  In the Australian Sydney Morning Herald, I mean, it's, oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda is attacking
[00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:12.804]  So, here it is.
[00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:16.335]  Which is a federal crime.
[00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:24.240]  He looks so mean and gruesome and evil, and this is not something that you want to, as an American, to portray your president, no matter what you think.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.541]  You know, that's very disrespectful.
[00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:30.304]  The signs depict President Barack Obama as the Joker or Clown.
[00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:35.087]  Residents have filed reports with the local police and called the city demanding they come down.
[00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:41.131]  I'd like to know who the person is making all these payments to tell the truth, so they can get at least part of the punishment.
[00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:50.398]  Known radio talk show host and internet personality Alex Jones is encouraging people to videotape themselves posting the signs, then upload it on YouTube for their chance at $1,000.
[00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:57.845]  Some call him a muckraker and conspiracy theorist who's determined to rally as many people as he can against the president.
[00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:05.591]  It doesn't matter who you support, and I've had friends call today that are both Republican, Democrat, Independent, and it's just very, very low and offensive.
[00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:11.266]  The Claremont Police are working with other investigators to try to track down who's responsible.
[00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:14.867]  Reporting live in Claremont, Darlene Jones, Eyewitness News this morning.
[00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:21.949]  How about you track down the people, like the President, who told his folks to put him on stop signs, the pro-Obama?
[00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.751]  How about you track down all the kids that the Florida CPS have kidnapped, that have come up missing, that CNN even reports on?
[00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:33.833]  How about you track down whoever stole the $23.7 trillion and counting $2 trillion a month?
[00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:39.485]  The last 10 months, they've stolen more than $2 trillion a month.
[00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:42.768]  So, more than $2 trillion a month.
[00:06:43.148 --> 00:06:55.519]  How about you find out about that, and all the corruption, and Blackwater, and the hit teams, and the murder squads, and the rape rooms with the Pentagon at Abu Ghraib?
[00:06:57.233 --> 00:06:58.134]  How about all of that?
[00:06:58.254 --> 00:07:00.935]  No, no, we have to get all upset on newscasts.
[00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:05.277]  I mean, there's newscasts all over the country freaking out and looking scared.
[00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:06.638]  And it's gruesome.
[00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:10.040]  I mean, right here in Texas, they're like, it's scary and wrong.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.543]  And in the Hays County Press, it says, like, he wants to come get you at night.
[00:07:14.883 --> 00:07:15.963]  This needs to be illegal.
[00:07:16.023 --> 00:07:17.224]  It's like he's a boogeyman.
[00:07:17.264 --> 00:07:18.165]  We're scared.
[00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:20.286]  Whoever did this needs to be arrested.
[00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:27.802]  And then Spanish TV all over the Americas is on there going, you know, international saying, why do you, why is this happening?
[00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:32.004]  And the guy says in Spanish, because the makers of the poster don't like the Brown president.
[00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:33.185]  They need to be arrested.
[00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:38.368]  I mean, you can't, you can show George Bush as a vampire.
[00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:42.831]  You can show George Bush as a, as a goblin or as the Joker.
[00:07:43.737 --> 00:07:44.617]  And that's okay!
[00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:52.161]  The same newspaper, the Village Voice, that showed him on the cover as a vampire, and as the Joker said, it's okay for Bush but not Obama because he's black.
[00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:54.002]  This is mind control.
[00:07:55.283 --> 00:08:02.186]  Now, giving us the inside scoop, he's just going to go by First Amendment Defender.
[00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:06.028]  Teenager at center of Obama Joker poster.
[00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:06.689]  Controversy.
[00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:08.510]  Police watch me post flyers.
[00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:14.475]  And we asked him to contact us yesterday, knowing he was a listener, and he did contact us.
[00:08:15.336 --> 00:08:17.718]  And he can now tell us the whole story.
[00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:18.578]  Sir, thank you.
[00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:19.719]  How old are you?
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.643]  I really don't want to give that info out, Alex, but it's really great to be on your show today.
[00:08:23.683 --> 00:08:24.323]  I'm happy to do it.
[00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:25.804]  Well, you sound pretty old.
[00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:26.705]  What are you, 17?
[00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:28.987]  Around there, yeah.
[00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:31.189]  Okay, so you're a senior in high school, I'll guess.
[00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.670]  You're close.
[00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:33.791]  Junior.
[00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.672]  I mean, the government already knows who you are, so we're just trying to get a snapshot.
[00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:42.032]  Okay.
[00:08:42.412 --> 00:08:43.453]  Tell us what really happened.
[00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:45.053]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:08:45.253 --> 00:08:46.434]  It is mind control.
[00:08:46.674 --> 00:08:54.297]  I mean, FoxNews.com is now promoting the idea that five years in jail is an appropriate punishment for distributing flyers.
[00:08:54.377 --> 00:08:56.498]  So, I mean, it is, you know, chilling a free speech.
[00:08:56.558 --> 00:08:59.939]  They're trying to scare patriots into not standing up and taking action.
[00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:04.121]  But as far as the situation in Claremont goes, you know,
[00:09:05.228 --> 00:09:10.231]  After you announced the contest, you know, a couple days later I started putting them on telephone poles and that was it.
[00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:19.917]  A couple days after that, WFTV jumped on it and pretty much turned a non-issue into a, you know, a statewide pandemic.
[00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:25.700]  Shortly after the media jumped on, I was contacted by two investigators.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.540]  They interviewed me.
[00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:34.305]  They told me to my face that they normally look the other way with the city ordinance that I didn't even know about and I don't think many other people do either.
[00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:36.241]  And then I wasn't in trouble for it.
[00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:43.343]  And then shortly after that, you have the media saying that I'm in jail, I'm being interrogated, and I'm, you know, awaiting trial and all kinds of things like that.
[00:09:43.403 --> 00:09:43.984]  Now let me stop you there.
[00:09:44.024 --> 00:09:45.204]  The media lied.
[00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:52.246]  A whole bunch of different newspapers and TV said you had been taken to jail, you had been arrested, and were in custody.
[00:09:53.106 --> 00:09:54.347]  Police were very upset.
[00:09:54.607 --> 00:10:03.052]  I mean, it was like War of the Worlds, as if Bakersfield had giant flying saucer, tripod aliens, ray-gunning buildings.
[00:10:03.112 --> 00:10:06.254]  I mean, it was people on the news looking scared.
[00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:07.514]  We don't know what to do.
[00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:08.815]  We're getting hit hard.
[00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:10.556]  This is like the Tet Offensive.
[00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:12.412]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:14.533]  They're trying to make an example out of somebody.
[00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:27.282]  They're trying to make patrons believe that if they do what I did, they will go to jail, they will be interrogated, and FoxNews.com is promoting they may go to jail for five years just for distributing and posting flyers.
[00:10:29.577 --> 00:10:33.020]  Now, specifically, can you give us the names of the officers?
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:43.468]  This is going to be important on record, that normally they look the other way, but with you, you have to be persecuted because a few ninnies don't like the message.
[00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.509]  Yeah, sure.
[00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:51.054]  It was Investigator Sanchez and Investigator Lane, A-L-N-E of the Claremont Police Department.
[00:10:51.475 --> 00:10:55.238]  They told me to my face that I was not in trouble and that they normally look the other way.
[00:10:55.258 --> 00:10:55.298]  So.
[00:10:58.473 --> 00:10:58.673]  Yeah, sure.
[00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:31.250]  Okay, well, I will give your number to Fox News and then they can correct themselves.
[00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.231]  But, yeah, no, they're acting like you're this arch criminal.
[00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:42.013]  But have you noticed that I would say nine out of ten, maybe more, of the comments are for you, seeing how hypocritical and asinine this is?
[00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:52.036]  And this big manhunt for you, according to the media, which didn't exist, did serve, though, to cause the viral distribution to expand.
[00:11:52.486 --> 00:11:53.727]  Yeah, no, people didn't buy into it.
[00:11:53.767 --> 00:11:56.229]  They just retaliated and said, no, we're not going back down.
[00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:58.150]  We're just going to exercise our right even more.
[00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.532]  And, you know, he said it was 9 out of 10 people.
[00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:07.016]  Well, that Orlando Sentinel poll said 59% of people thought that the caricature of Obama was appropriate.
[00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:10.638]  And, you know, I'm sure that poll was manipulated and spun in all kinds of ways.
[00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.760]  What do your parents think of your thought crime?
[00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:18.404]  Oh, I mean, I can't speak for them, but they seem pretty supportive of it.
[00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:22.614]  You know, I have a lot of family who are proud of it.
[00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:24.155]  You know, I can't say I'm not.
[00:12:26.457 --> 00:12:30.359]  You know, my father was pretty involved in the Ron Paul revolution and campaign and all that.
[00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:32.380]  So, my whole family is pretty awake at the NWO.
[00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.922]  Well, now they want to put you in jail for two years.
[00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:39.984]  And they want to give you... Five, according to Fox News.
[00:12:40.224 --> 00:12:40.805]  Oh yeah, five.
[00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:41.285]  Excuse me.
[00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.666]  I don't have the article in front of me.
[00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:43.506]  Okay, five years.
[00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:45.427]  Maybe you're going to go to Siberia.
[00:12:45.467 --> 00:12:46.648]  I mean, actually... Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:48.409]  Send me to the salt pit in Ukraine or whatever.
[00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:56.614]  Well, that's what Alexander Sholtson-Eatson, he got 10 years for speaking out and handing out handbills covertly.
[00:12:56.654 --> 00:12:57.214]  Did you know that?
[00:12:57.254 --> 00:12:59.835]  Maybe you'll be like Alexander Sholtson-Eatson.
[00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:05.677]  Maybe you'll be up at Alaska, a big beard, busting rocks with the Commissar standing over you.
[00:13:06.397 --> 00:13:07.338]  Yeah, maybe I'll be brave.
[00:13:07.358 --> 00:13:07.798]  I don't know.
[00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.800]  Well, I mean, you know, we joke about this, but this is really happening.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.201]  Now, they say they've gone to the state
[00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:24.948]  Attorney General, have you heard if you're going to be basically like Braveheart, taken and drawn and quartered by the state?
[00:13:25.473 --> 00:13:29.717]  No, ever since the two investigators spoke with me, I have not heard anything.
[00:13:29.937 --> 00:13:35.841]  So I guess I'll tell Brad King, the state attorney, on whether or not anything's going to happen.
[00:13:36.142 --> 00:13:39.344]  But I'm really not that worried about being a martyr or anything.
[00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:46.150]  I'm not really even that mad at the police or anything, because the only reason they got involved was because the media put so much pressure on them.
[00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.293]  They also told me that if it hadn't been for the media, they probably wouldn't even have looked into it.
[00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:57.863]  Now, I'm told, well the news reported that after they tried to thoughtcrime you, that more posters were put up.
[00:13:58.544 --> 00:13:58.984]  Yeah, sure.
[00:13:59.004 --> 00:13:59.984]  No, I'm not the only person.
[00:14:00.024 --> 00:14:04.147]  We are changed and you know, the Patriot movement have quite a presence in Central Florida.
[00:14:04.227 --> 00:14:08.890]  So I mean, you know, there's also a pretty wide variety of different flyers coming out too.
[00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.013]  Just driving around yesterday, I saw flyers everywhere that said, don't take the vaccine.
[00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.131]  Yeah, that was us calling for that, so it's already begun.
[00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:17.191]  Stay there, man.
[00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.011]  You are awesome.
[00:14:18.572 --> 00:14:20.052]  This guy needs his own radio show.
[00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:22.993]  He's well-spoken, focused, ready to defeat the enemy.
[00:14:23.433 --> 00:14:25.614]  He's a hardcore thought criminal, though, folks.
[00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:26.915]  Hide your women and children.
[00:14:27.215 --> 00:14:28.475]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:29.916]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[00:14:30.316 --> 00:14:31.797]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:36.741]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:41.705]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:32.513]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:39.978]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:15:40.578 --> 00:15:46.762]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:15:47.302 --> 00:15:49.003]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:15:49.143 --> 00:15:51.564]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:15:51.644 --> 00:16:02.669]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:04.510]  It's not about left or right.
[00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.291]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:16:06.751 --> 00:16:13.014]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:16:13.644 --> 00:16:21.431]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:23.072]  The Obama Deception.
[00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:24.674]  The people strike back!
[00:16:27.233 --> 00:16:29.174]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:32.076]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:40.682]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:16:41.002 --> 00:16:43.824]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:16:43.984 --> 00:16:47.867]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:16:49.188 --> 00:16:50.789]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:16:51.169 --> 00:16:52.090]  Take action now!
[00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.872]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:16:57.053 --> 00:17:00.795]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:04.237]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:10.781]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:16.370]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:19.154]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:21.077]  Call me, John Humer, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:33.568]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:17:33.868 --> 00:17:49.783]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:17:50.063 --> 00:17:55.227]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:17:55.447 --> 00:18:01.732]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:18:01.952 --> 00:18:05.595]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:18:05.855 --> 00:18:08.437]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:13.901]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:16.802]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:19.083]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:18:19.103 --> 00:18:21.564]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:18:21.604 --> 00:18:25.946]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:18:25.966 --> 00:18:31.128]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:18:36.341 --> 00:18:45.963]  We have the Central Texas Thought Criminal Alex Jones here with the Central Florida Thought Criminal.
[00:18:46.763 --> 00:18:50.484]  Freedom of hate speech is the Hays County Press News headline.
[00:18:51.444 --> 00:18:56.665]  The City Morning Herald is Obama Joker poster labeled cultural terrorism.
[00:18:56.985 --> 00:19:00.686]  They're calling for my arrest on international Spanish TV.
[00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:05.189]  I mean this is getting more and more insane by the minute.
[00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.354]  I just had Tyler TV in Northeast Texas call.
[00:19:09.374 --> 00:19:10.655]  They're plastered everywhere there.
[00:19:10.675 --> 00:19:15.520]  Probably going to have that reporter question me live on air because I don't have time to go off air and talk to him.
[00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:20.986]  This is just getting wilder and wilder showing how atrophied our rights are.
[00:19:21.607 --> 00:19:22.608]  Now let me ask the
[00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:34.214]  Ron Paul slash Alex Jones listener supporter a question the young man who who the media is hoaxing and acting like is going to go to jail and Fox News and others calling for his arrest basically.
[00:19:36.035 --> 00:19:41.218]  Why do you think I mean because I know if you're a Ron Paul supporter you weren't probably for McCain or Obama you saw through that.
[00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:44.546]  So you're not that.
[00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:53.330]  Why were people allowed to put up Bush as a monkey, Bush as an ape, Bush as a witch, Bush as a devil, Bush as a vampire, Bush as a joker?
[00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:57.993]  All that was everywhere, all over the country, everywhere I went, stuck on walls.
[00:19:58.253 --> 00:20:03.335]  Why didn't the media start getting all, oh my gosh, what are we going to do?
[00:20:03.395 --> 00:20:04.296]  It's scary!
[00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:05.396]  Arrest them!
[00:20:05.757 --> 00:20:09.358]  I mean, I guess that's because he was like the corporate god.
[00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:12.200]  Obama was going to be our savior and you can't talk bad about him?
[00:20:12.904 --> 00:20:20.448]  Well, my hypothesis on that is they didn't really start allowing that until after Bush was used up by the New World Order.
[00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:23.109]  I mean, right after 9-11, his approval rating was above 90%.
[00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.390]  You couldn't really say anything bad about him.
[00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.312]  And then towards the end of the second term, when they were all done with him, then you could criticize him.
[00:20:29.372 --> 00:20:31.453]  I imagine that being the case with Obama, too.
[00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:36.336]  If he's more than a one-term president, by the end of the second term, you'll probably be allowed to make fun of him any way you want.
[00:20:36.755 --> 00:20:38.076]  Man, you are really smart.
[00:20:39.016 --> 00:20:39.996]  Why are you so informed?
[00:20:40.016 --> 00:20:41.597]  That's absolutely what's going on.
[00:20:41.897 --> 00:20:42.997]  He's fresh for them.
[00:20:43.057 --> 00:20:44.318]  He's a new birdcage liner.
[00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:45.979]  They don't have the next liner ready.
[00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:52.321]  They want him to, the New World Order bird, to sully him, take all the blame, and then nobody looks at the bird.
[00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:53.161]  They look at the paper.
[00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:55.422]  They can put their next puppet in.
[00:20:55.682 --> 00:20:57.503]  He was a little bit darker shade of paper.
[00:20:57.563 --> 00:20:59.544]  Usually we have a white paper birdcage liner.
[00:20:59.924 --> 00:21:03.145]  And so it was the novelty of, ooh, there's a brown birdcage liner.
[00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:04.446]  Ooh, don't talk about it.
[00:21:06.447 --> 00:21:11.670]  But now, we're here sullying their little puppet early.
[00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.012]  Ooh, you've committed a very bad boo-boo.
[00:21:14.713 --> 00:21:16.274]  Well, the same thing with Bill Clinton, too.
[00:21:16.334 --> 00:21:22.678]  I mean, you know, they didn't, you know, the old Monica Lewinsky affair came out, you know, right at the end of the second term, you know.
[00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:26.301]  Right when they didn't need him anymore, they just destroyed him and, you know, got rid of him.
[00:21:27.522 --> 00:21:29.083]  Where did you learn that paradigm?
[00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:30.218]  What?
[00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:32.364]  Oh, I mean, I read InfoWars daily.
[00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.952]  I mean, I've been in the InfoWars for about a year now.
[00:21:34.992 --> 00:21:36.556]  I mean, all I do is read and learn, so...
[00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:42.648]  Well, it's very, very exciting what you are doing, my friend.
[00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:48.012]  I just, I just cannot be more excited about what you're doing.
[00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:53.535]  Describe, though, you're saying that it's just intensifying, that there's more and more posters everywhere?
[00:21:53.815 --> 00:22:06.703]  That's got to really frustrate these control freaks, these anti-American trash that start hyperventilating, and not over checkpoints and police in black masks and roadside cameras and open borders, they hyperventilate over freedom.
[00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:12.116]  Yeah, and that's why it's even more important that we continue to do it, and not only do it, but do it even more.
[00:22:12.136 --> 00:22:25.332]  I mean, I was listening to your interview with the AR-15 guy, Chris, yesterday, and he says that, you know, the best thing the Second Amendment movement can do is to open carry firearms even more, and I think that's how it should be with the First Amendment, too.
[00:22:25.352 --> 00:22:27.615]  We just need to keep exercising it more and more and more.
[00:22:28.433 --> 00:22:32.815]  I mean, you know, if the majority of Americans were out posting flyers, there's nothing they could do about it.
[00:22:32.855 --> 00:22:39.538]  But when it's just a minority, even an irate minority, you know, they're able to make, you know, they're able to crucify one person and make an example out of them.
[00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:54.965]  Well, I've been saying for years that they've put the message out to kind of the dumbed-down masses that don't know the branches of government, don't know the time of day, are just kind of going through life and accepting whatever happens, that the billboards and the movies and the images say all guns are illegal.
[00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:57.586]  So, perception is reality with morons.
[00:22:58.306 --> 00:23:04.711]  And so we've got to come out and say, look, my guns aren't illegal, because I don't know if you've seen this, but we post it all the time.
[00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:06.413]  I mean, it's scary.
[00:23:06.513 --> 00:23:17.142]  Even in Arizona and Texas and Vermont, supposedly pro-gun states, people get raided every day because a neighbor saw their neighbor cleaning a gun in the garage or putting it in their car.
[00:23:17.842 --> 00:23:21.304]  And the cops come and take them and say, well, you're not allowed to have five guns.
[00:23:21.724 --> 00:23:28.727]  I've seen three guns and 500 rounds called an arsenal and people arrested for it when there's no law.
[00:23:29.167 --> 00:23:33.629]  And then the person gets mad and they call him mentally ill and throw him in a mental institution.
[00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:36.090]  Well, yeah, it's just part of the conditioning, too.
[00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.611]  I mean, it doesn't even take that now to get into trouble.
[00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:40.732]  All it takes is a Ron Paul bumper sticker.
[00:23:42.452 --> 00:23:43.032]  There you go!
[00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:48.154]  We saw people arrested for Ron Paul stickers, doors kicked in for Ron Paul signs.
[00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:55.696]  The DHS report, now we know why cops were doing that, it came out after, said somebody has a Ron Paul sticker, they want to kill cops.
[00:23:56.217 --> 00:24:01.038]  And so, not all cops are stupid, just like the general public, but some are dumber than dirt, just like the public.
[00:24:01.338 --> 00:24:03.059]  And they see it and go, I got one!
[00:24:03.259 --> 00:24:03.859]  Pull him over!
[00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:05.300]  I got one of the terrorists!
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.640]  That Ron Paul!
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.501]  That Bob Barr!
[00:24:09.601 --> 00:24:11.624]  What are we gonna do?
[00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:16.630]  It's scary looking!
[00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.932]  We're on the march.
[00:24:18.432 --> 00:24:20.014]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:23.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:30.240]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:32.282]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:24:32.502 --> 00:24:40.790]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:46.254]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:24:46.574 --> 00:24:48.196]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:54.758]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:24:54.938 --> 00:25:05.700]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.500]  That's right.
[00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:09.081]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:10.902]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:25:13.483 --> 00:25:31.438]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:25:31.578 --> 00:25:33.580]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.962]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:25:35.982 --> 00:25:37.963]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:25:38.384 --> 00:25:39.745]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:41.046]  There is a solution.
[00:25:41.266 --> 00:25:49.272]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:25:49.692 --> 00:25:56.757]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:25:57.157 --> 00:26:02.761]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:08.765]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:12.990]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:19.519]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.

[00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:32.386]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:26:33.107 --> 00:26:38.448]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:26:38.968 --> 00:26:45.130]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.291]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:26:47.451 --> 00:26:49.832]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:26:49.912 --> 00:27:00.857]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:27:03.098 --> 00:27:04.379]  It's not about left or right.
[00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:06.160]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:12.863]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:27:13.527 --> 00:27:21.294]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:21.794 --> 00:27:22.935]  The Obama Deception.
[00:27:23.376 --> 00:27:24.557]  The people strike back!
[00:27:36.218 --> 00:27:51.463]  Hartman just made the point that this is like landmines in the Infowar, time release, detonating in different parts of the country, different parts of the world, and then as the media comes out from San Francisco to Tyler, Texas, you name it, and demonizes
[00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:54.800]  That people are putting up posters.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:00.943]  90 plus percent of people that we've seen in the letters to the editor and in the comments go, well, wait a minute.
[00:28:01.584 --> 00:28:04.626]  Even if you're an Obama supporter, everybody was bashing Bush this way.
[00:28:04.986 --> 00:28:06.066]  This is the First Amendment.
[00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:09.428]  I mean, they hung up posters of George Washington when he was president.
[00:28:09.468 --> 00:28:11.670]  They glued them up to walls.
[00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.551]  I mean, nobody ninnied over that.
[00:28:15.826 --> 00:28:18.428]  And making them act like tyrants is the key.
[00:28:18.468 --> 00:28:25.653]  Like three weeks ago the media said it's all a hoax, only lobbyists, paid lobbyists are posing as citizens, everyone wants health care.
[00:28:26.294 --> 00:28:34.140]  And two weeks into that they had to say, okay, we apologize, you are the citizens, you're not AstroTurf, you're not Nazis, you're not devils, you have a right to.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.562]  And then now the whole thing is falling apart.
[00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:40.941]  Though they may use the whole flu freakout to get that rammed through.
[00:28:40.961 --> 00:28:45.545]  And we're going to go to your calls coming up in a few minutes after our guest leaves us.
[00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:46.306]  Flu only.
[00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:48.788]  But this is a whole First Amendment issue right now.
[00:28:49.089 --> 00:28:51.431]  Going back to the young man who was questioned by police.
[00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:54.353]  The media lied that he was arrested and they said, okay, he was detained.
[00:28:55.294 --> 00:28:57.816]  They're looking at felony charges at the state right now.
[00:28:58.137 --> 00:29:02.441]  But that sounds like it's just fear-mongering hype by the media to scare people.
[00:29:03.868 --> 00:29:19.480]  Because if the public, with his approval rating dropping the fastest of any president ever, eight months into office, lower than Bush, lower than Carter, losing a few points a week now, if the public manifests things with signs on the streets, and that's the best way.
[00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:22.703]  Some big protest where you march downtown, the media can ignore that.
[00:29:23.143 --> 00:29:30.509]  But lots of people at street corners and flyers and putting them up and talking and doing it legally and lawfully, this can bring them down.
[00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.391]  Your comments on that, sir.
[00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:39.795]  Yeah, I think the most important thing for us to do is just, you know, to promote a culture of liberty, like you said at the end of the Obama deception.
[00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:44.798]  You know, tyranny cannot survive in a society where people demand freedom, and that includes freedom of speech.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.481]  Well, I agree with you, my friend.
[00:29:48.501 --> 00:29:51.163]  They portray, then, in
[00:29:55.145 --> 00:30:06.312]  The different cities, not just the town you're in, but that in Orlando and other areas that everyone hates it, and it's evil, and it's scary, and even Republicans are angry.
[00:30:06.832 --> 00:30:17.519]  Talking to people in your town, just on the street, what percentage are saying this is great, this is wonderful, what percentage are domesticated, castrated slaves?
[00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:25.133]  I'd say all but about a fraction of a percent are okay, and then that other fraction of a percent are the castrated slaves.
[00:30:25.373 --> 00:30:32.997]  While I was posting the flyers, I actually had a couple crazed Obamanoids really get in my face, and one of them started taking pictures of me.
[00:30:33.533 --> 00:30:37.815]  He's saying he's going to turn me in like he's some kind of secret police or something out of 1984.
[00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:44.459]  I had people, you know, oh I mean not people, but I had one person, you know, call me, you know, an effing skinhead.
[00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:48.561]  You know, I'm sitting there wearing a bathing suit and, you know, flip-flops and he's calling me a skinhead.
[00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:55.124]  But other than that, you know, most people either, A, don't care and don't have a problem with it or, you know, think it's funny.
[00:30:56.345 --> 00:30:57.266]  Well, that's the issue.
[00:30:57.306 --> 00:31:01.450]  That's why they want to radicalize all the groups and make it a racial issue.
[00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:09.156]  That's why the media advertises and hypes whoever is out there engaging in the really anti-Semitic stuff.
[00:31:09.437 --> 00:31:10.958]  Turns out they're feds every time.
[00:31:11.318 --> 00:31:12.800]  And that's what I warn all these people.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:13.841]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:31:35.077 --> 00:31:37.038]  I mean, just crazy.
[00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:49.387]  So that's how they were able to go to your house, was because the Obamanoids took photos of you, took them to the police department like good little Maoist Soviets, and I've seen them all over the news.
[00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:51.629]  They're calling for my arrest, they're calling for my death.
[00:31:52.009 --> 00:31:56.773]  The Southern Poverty Law Center allowed comments to stay up for months, calling for my execution.
[00:31:57.233 --> 00:31:58.614]  These are really sick people.
[00:31:59.881 --> 00:32:02.762]  Yeah, no, they're literally turning on their own species.
[00:32:02.822 --> 00:32:06.163]  I mean, you know, they're wanting to deprive their fellow man of freedom.
[00:32:08.164 --> 00:32:11.965]  Well, again, you're the young man that put up some of the signs, but you said there's a lot of other folks.
[00:32:12.045 --> 00:32:17.306]  Is it accelerating after they engage in the hoax saying you've been arrested?
[00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:22.205]  Is it now dying down around your town?
[00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:24.148]  Unfortunately it is dying down.
[00:32:24.168 --> 00:32:30.797]  So I do call on any Central Florida Patriots to keep it up and get back out and do some more.
[00:32:32.178 --> 00:32:34.001]  But you are seeing the signs up there?
[00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:35.343]  Oh yeah, they're not going away.
[00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:41.122]  I mean, the power of citizens, period, putting up signs, this is what the Sons of Liberty did.
[00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:49.766]  They would put up simple broadsheets with a couple lines of text on it, and this brought the British Empire down and the Americas.
[00:32:50.627 --> 00:32:58.651]  And they are so scared to death of this, and so you're now seeing signs that say, don't take the flu shot, what is the image?
[00:32:59.762 --> 00:33:00.563]  Uh, it's pretty funny.
[00:33:00.603 --> 00:33:01.784]  It's actually a snake.
[00:33:02.765 --> 00:33:04.727]  Uh, and instead of fangs, that's syringes.
[00:33:04.747 --> 00:33:06.108]  That was on the flyer.
[00:33:06.128 --> 00:33:07.209]  It said, do not... Let me guess.
[00:33:07.229 --> 00:33:10.231]  So they're using the David Dees illustration image.
[00:33:10.632 --> 00:33:10.832]  Yeah.
[00:33:11.473 --> 00:33:11.833]  Perfect.
[00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:13.054]  We'll post that.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:14.635]  I'm sure Dees is happy for us, too.
[00:33:15.216 --> 00:33:16.117]  See, what a great artist.
[00:33:16.137 --> 00:33:16.777]  Graphic artist.
[00:33:17.638 --> 00:33:19.340]  Everything he does gets seen by millions of people.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.181]  Uh, I've seen it with a snake.
[00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:21.802]  That's it.
[00:33:23.183 --> 00:33:24.944]  But that's not going to be the contest winner.
[00:33:25.464 --> 00:33:26.325]  I'm going to have another $1,000.
[00:33:26.365 --> 00:33:31.508]  I need Kurt Nemo to tune in and write up the contest rules by tonight, please.
[00:33:32.129 --> 00:33:41.635]  There's going to be $1,000 for whoever comes up with the best poster, with the best image, and Deez can be part of it.
[00:33:41.655 --> 00:33:46.298]  He can come up with a new image if he wants, but we're also going to post his as an example that people should initially use.
[00:33:48.354 --> 00:33:55.261]  But it just needs to say, don't take the shot, don't take the flu shot at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com
[00:33:57.874 --> 00:33:58.754]  On the top.
[00:33:58.834 --> 00:34:01.436]  So, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com on the top.
[00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:04.437]  And then we'll always have a vaccine area there for people to be alerted.
[00:34:04.457 --> 00:34:06.257]  We already have that, but we'll make it prominent.
[00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:08.058]  Because I don't have time to build another site.
[00:34:08.098 --> 00:34:09.799]  The point is, we'll have that up there.
[00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:13.060]  And at the bottom, don't take the flu shot or don't take the shot.
[00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:17.682]  And we're going to have $1,000 for the best poster.
[00:34:18.282 --> 00:34:23.084]  The best poster that is then also publicly displayed in a legal and lawful way.
[00:34:23.504 --> 00:34:24.505]  Or the most artful way.
[00:34:25.598 --> 00:34:27.540]  And so the best poster.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.181]  But we don't want people to wait.
[00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.844]  We want people just to go absolutely ape.
[00:34:33.164 --> 00:34:38.728]  So, will you guys ask Janae Meadows or ask Douglas right now to take the David Dees.
[00:34:38.748 --> 00:34:45.954]  You can go to Deesillustration.com with the two fangs coming out of its mouth and then say don't take the flu shot.
[00:34:46.294 --> 00:34:47.074]  That is genius.
[00:34:47.094 --> 00:34:51.098]  Let's get a simple InfoWars Prison Planet variant of that up and then the contest will be
[00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:55.299]  Whoever can come up with the best poster and post them.
[00:34:55.779 --> 00:34:57.739]  Best posters, so it's not just our posters.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:08.082]  We'll send them to contest.infowars.com and or post them on the web, send them to us, we'll put a link to them and we will put those up.
[00:35:08.502 --> 00:35:13.903]  And again, this is getting everybody... I wanted to demonstrate to everybody the power of people just taking action.
[00:35:14.203 --> 00:35:20.465]  I don't know if people realize how serious... I mean, it could be called the poster revolution in the United States, my friend.
[00:35:21.667 --> 00:35:22.588]  Yeah, it can go down in history.
[00:35:22.608 --> 00:35:24.269]  You know, like the Boston Tea Party.
[00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:30.855]  I wonder if they'll say we're being racist against snakes, if we show a snake with acid fangs.
[00:35:31.056 --> 00:35:32.477]  Yeah, we're anti-reptilian.
[00:35:32.877 --> 00:35:33.498]  Anti-snake.
[00:35:34.659 --> 00:35:41.065]  They'll probably claim that's racist, but you know what, you've got to ignore their asinine attempts to cold-bloodedly silence your free speech.
[00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:46.350]  The people doing this, listen, you've got the floor over the last few minutes, say whatever you like, said to me, just hyperventilating.
[00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:59.448]  Well, I mean, look, I'm just one man, and I just post, or one boy, I just posted these on telephone poles, and I was able to get this story on, you know, literally over a dozen, you know, uh, central Florida media outlets.
[00:35:59.508 --> 00:36:00.348]  I'm just one person.
[00:36:00.368 --> 00:36:03.650]  I didn't even imagine it would generate this kind of, uh, you know, buzz.
[00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.012]  So, I mean, imagine if we all did this.
[00:36:06.092 --> 00:36:11.034]  I mean, you know, I mean, there's a lot more of us than there are of them, and by them, I mean, you know, the tyrants.
[00:36:11.114 --> 00:36:15.317]  I mean, if people would just realize that if we all post flyers, they can't stop us.
[00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:22.330]  I just call on all people in Central Florida especially to keep it up.
[00:36:23.131 --> 00:36:27.332]  If you haven't joined We Are Change yet, go to meetup.com slash wearechangeflorida.
[00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:32.453]  We'll be passing out free DVDs and stuff for the upcoming Tea Party in downtown Orlando.
[00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.974]  Yeah, I've been doing my own informal study around the country.
[00:36:37.174 --> 00:36:39.575]  I would say half of Ron Paul's support
[00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.132]  Yeah, I don't hold it against him.
[00:37:04.977 --> 00:37:07.798]  Hey, I gotta deal with all this other stuff, and I understand that.
[00:37:08.238 --> 00:37:14.420]  And you know, when he's on my show, he'll talk about false flag, he'll talk about Gulf of Tonkin, Ajax, stage provocations.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:22.103]  I mean, Paul hasn't told me off the side, hey, I'm a 9-11 truther, but he knows about stage provocation.
[00:37:22.423 --> 00:37:28.665]  And I think he understands, though, that it might have been a good move in the final equation, because...
[00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:33.283]  of him holding his cards to his vest because now look at him.
[00:37:33.323 --> 00:37:34.764]  They tried to destroy him in the media.
[00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:40.346]  Now he's too big for that to even happen because they can try to manufacture things.
[00:37:41.227 --> 00:37:42.908]  They can try to set him up in hotel rooms.
[00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:46.490]  They can try to distort what he says, edit what he says.
[00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.551]  More and more of that happens to me, man.
[00:37:48.671 --> 00:37:54.674]  I am seeing stuff where they will take hundreds of shows I've done and edit it down really slickly.
[00:37:55.094 --> 00:38:00.639]  Yeah, they're getting the same file source, you know, going to our archives, so it sounds the same, and really doing some nasty stuff.
[00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:07.245]  And I know they've been trying that on Ron Paul, too, or taking out of context what he said in newsletters, but it didn't work.
[00:38:07.345 --> 00:38:10.848]  I mean, it's so exciting what's happening as we gain momentum.
[00:38:11.128 --> 00:38:20.256]  So you're calling for folks, even though you're facing hyped-up felony charges, do we give into this and become the Soviet Union, or do we intensify it tenfold?
[00:38:20.917 --> 00:38:22.158]  Intensify it a hundredfold.
[00:38:24.949 --> 00:38:26.831]  Yeah, no, do as much as he possibly can.
[00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.613]  You know, go to Kinko's and have a thousand printed up and put them all up.
[00:38:30.854 --> 00:38:34.276]  Well, I think it's also important to carry a video camera.
[00:38:34.396 --> 00:38:42.783]  I mean, San Antonio, we are changed, was stapling them up to telephone poles in the Bar District where there were already other people's posters everywhere.
[00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:47.266]  And Obama supporters, white yuppies that looked like they were out of their minds, just like so
[00:38:48.283 --> 00:38:53.289]  Walk over and rip it off because they bought into the corporate image of Obama, which he isn't that image.
[00:38:53.629 --> 00:38:54.470]  It's a total fraud.
[00:38:54.951 --> 00:39:03.641]  They have completely bought into it and so they just can't get out of it and they don't want to admit they've been conned.
[00:39:03.661 --> 00:39:08.247]  You know, they're that hardcore 30-40% that Obama could be doing
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.620]  You know, killing children on the White House lawn.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.861]  His wife could be doing voodoo dances and no one would care.
[00:39:14.881 --> 00:39:19.382]  Rahm Emanuel could be doing whatever he wants and they don't care.
[00:39:21.822 --> 00:39:25.903]  And just the image of them coming up and trying to get those posters.
[00:39:26.223 --> 00:39:27.643]  I mean, describe these people to me.
[00:39:28.543 --> 00:39:30.284]  Well, no, it really does bother them.
[00:39:30.304 --> 00:39:34.404]  I don't think they're mad that we're mocking Obama.
[00:39:34.424 --> 00:39:38.085]  I think they're just mad that they're saying they're God.
[00:39:38.789 --> 00:39:42.450]  You know, it's almost like the Joker image of Obama is his true image.
[00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.850]  You know, he's a sinister, evil, untrustworthy, you know, criminal.
[00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:49.591]  And when they see that, it just bothers them a lot and disturbs them.
[00:39:49.891 --> 00:39:57.553]  But I have faith in him because, I mean, my whole family used to be a bunch of Bush supporters, including me, and now I'm on sidewalks with a bullhorn saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:39:57.573 --> 00:39:58.673]  So anybody can turn around.
[00:39:58.693 --> 00:39:59.713]  I mean, we were all there once.
[00:40:00.913 --> 00:40:01.754]  Hey, I was too.
[00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:08.135]  I mean, I knew about the Federal Reserve and the New World Order, but I was like a kind of mainline Ron Paul type 14 years ago.
[00:40:09.375 --> 00:40:10.696]  And now the facts are the facts.
[00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:21.983]  I mean, on so many issues, I have changed my perspective as I learned more and as I realized how this game is played.
[00:40:22.543 --> 00:40:27.927]  And so really, my job is to describe to people how the game is played and show people examples of this.
[00:40:28.407 --> 00:40:32.550]  And more and more, once you know the magician's trick, it's game over.
[00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:34.291]  Yeah.
[00:40:36.502 --> 00:40:37.182]  I mean, describe.
[00:40:37.202 --> 00:40:37.683]  What would they do?
[00:40:37.703 --> 00:40:39.323]  I mean, they would run up to you and get in your face?
[00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.845]  Well, I can just recall the first person.
[00:40:42.865 --> 00:40:45.326]  It was a middle-aged man.
[00:40:45.366 --> 00:40:49.728]  He ran up to me, taking my picture with his cell phone camera, saying, I'm going to report you.
[00:40:49.748 --> 00:40:50.789]  I'm going to turn you in.
[00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:55.511]  And, you know, I'm asking why, because you can't post this stuff.
[00:40:55.531 --> 00:40:56.291]  This is wrong.
[00:40:56.311 --> 00:40:58.732]  And I said, well, I mean, this is my First Amendment right.
[00:40:58.752 --> 00:41:02.514]  You know, I absolutely have the right to say whatever I want and post whatever I want.
[00:41:03.277 --> 00:41:06.678]  He says, no you do not, no you do not, and he started calling me an effing skinhead.
[00:41:07.118 --> 00:41:11.399]  Actually, he actually threatened to, quote, slap the hell out of me if I didn't stop also.
[00:41:13.279 --> 00:41:25.661]  But I mean, that's just one of them, and I'm not saying all Obama supporters are like that, but... But I mean, notice though, that in Iran, they were pulling down posters and slapping people, and the media was hyperventilating and freaking out.
[00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:27.902]  It's total selective enforcement.
[00:41:29.442 --> 00:41:29.902]  Absolutely.
[00:41:30.658 --> 00:41:35.602]  Oh, well, I mean, they even told me to my face, the investigators, that, you know, they don't enforce this ordinance normally.
[00:41:36.022 --> 00:41:41.046]  But now something unpopular has been posted that, you know, some people don't like that, you know, they may have to enforce it.
[00:41:41.626 --> 00:41:44.789]  Meanwhile, I drive around, there's, you know, garage sale signs on every other pole.
[00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:58.079]  Well, here is the Hays County Free Press, and in this article, they say, oh, we don't have an ordinance against this, and it said citizens are at the City Council demanding an ordinance.
[00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.331]  Oh, because you have people demanding to make it illegal?
[00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:03.471]  Oh, that's great.
[00:42:04.051 --> 00:42:09.692]  Yeah, because I knew most towns and cities, if you do it in the commons area, there's no ordinance against it.
[00:42:09.712 --> 00:42:20.295]  So I said follow local laws, but now they're saying legislate it out of there in this headline, freedom of hate speech.
[00:42:20.775 --> 00:42:22.736]  These people are begging to live in a tyranny.
[00:42:23.116 --> 00:42:27.797]  Don't they have any idea that once the First Amendment's gone, we're all totally screwed?
[00:42:28.427 --> 00:42:36.249]  Yeah, and unfortunately they won't know until they want to say something that they're passionate about, and they can't do it because they don't have the freedom to, because they gave it away.
[00:42:36.269 --> 00:42:37.850]  Well, I mean, take Michael Sandich.
[00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:54.135]  I mean, you know, he hates on Arabs 24-7, and I don't agree with that, because I'm not here to hate on Arabs, hate on Jews, hate on blacks, hate on... I do not like the racial groups that are into racial identity that are in all those groups, who everybody else's racial identity is bad but theirs.
[00:42:54.815 --> 00:42:55.996]  But I don't want to be sucked into that.
[00:42:56.036 --> 00:43:02.661]  But even though I disagree with Michael Savage on some issues, I fought for his right to not be banned from flying to England.
[00:43:03.062 --> 00:43:05.324]  And by the way, that got removed.
[00:43:05.344 --> 00:43:07.906]  We've got to support everybody's free speech.
[00:43:08.346 --> 00:43:09.026]  You think I like...
[00:43:09.901 --> 00:43:15.304]  The Feds posing as Klan members up there saying racial stuff that's now come out in the news to divide and conquer?
[00:43:15.344 --> 00:43:15.584]  No!
[00:43:16.125 --> 00:43:19.387]  But the Feds are doing that to get free speech banned.
[00:43:20.227 --> 00:43:28.292]  That's the issue because if we come out mainline and criticize the system together, then it's going to fall.
[00:43:28.352 --> 00:43:30.333]  They've got to radicalize it.
[00:43:30.373 --> 00:43:32.595]  They've got to make it racial and religious.
[00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:35.997]  And that's why I'm always attacked for not making it about that.
[00:43:39.028 --> 00:43:41.510]  Well, that's why it's even more important to keep posting stuff.
[00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:49.978]  I mean, even if, you know, a group of people are able to get legislation, you know, banning, you know, flyers and posters, you know, it can still be resisted.
[00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:52.700]  I mean, that's pretty just civil disobedience.
[00:44:04.178 --> 00:44:09.182]  Well, Danny, Floridian Patriots are interested in taking action.
[00:44:09.263 --> 00:44:10.824]  Join meetup.com.
[00:44:10.864 --> 00:44:12.005]  We are Change Florida.
[00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:13.827]  We do street action quite often.
[00:44:13.847 --> 00:44:17.209]  We'll be at the Tea Party in downtown Orlando this weekend.
[00:44:18.377 --> 00:44:22.779]  Even if you don't want to join us, stand up, be a lone wolf, just take action any way you can.
[00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:29.562]  If all of us just put 5% of our effort into this, this could all be turned over overnight.
[00:44:31.203 --> 00:44:36.245]  If all Patriots just went out and put up 10 flyers, this whole New World Order could come down overnight.
[00:44:37.029 --> 00:44:39.953]  Absolutely, and whatever your message is, put it out.
[00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:40.974]  Take Austin.
[00:44:41.014 --> 00:44:41.835]  We've put out some.
[00:44:41.895 --> 00:44:43.457]  I went out as the Joker.
[00:44:43.877 --> 00:44:48.923]  Put them up on South Old Torf, East Old Torf, in front of police.
[00:44:49.504 --> 00:44:49.844]  Okay?
[00:44:50.084 --> 00:44:50.325]  Because...
[00:44:51.553 --> 00:44:53.514]  If they selectively enforce on me, it's a fraud.
[00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:55.295]  I want to see Austin.
[00:44:55.335 --> 00:45:01.937]  I want to see all the activists in Austin, Texas, up and down Congress a hundred times what we've done, where everybody else puts their posters out.
[00:45:02.218 --> 00:45:04.078]  They don't dare selectively enforce.
[00:45:04.498 --> 00:45:07.400]  All the leftists that love seeing Bush torn down.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.441]  Let's see how they behave in this town.
[00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:12.261]  Let's see how they behave everywhere.
[00:45:12.582 --> 00:45:13.702]  Great job, my friend.
[00:45:13.842 --> 00:45:14.722]  Great having you on.
[00:45:15.142 --> 00:45:16.343]  Stay in contact with us.
[00:45:16.363 --> 00:45:19.204]  A lot of people want to contribute to a legal defense fund.
[00:45:19.464 --> 00:45:21.465]  If they come after you, that's going to happen.
[00:45:21.745 --> 00:45:22.385]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:26.653 --> 00:45:33.637]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:45:33.878 --> 00:45:37.520]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:45.905]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:45:46.145 --> 00:45:48.847]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:45:49.047 --> 00:45:51.549]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:52.369]  We're good.

[00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:30.155]  A new world order.
[00:47:30.876 --> 00:47:35.499]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.681]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:40.863]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:47:41.383 --> 00:47:43.785]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:47:44.543 --> 00:47:51.881]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:47:54.901 --> 00:47:59.864]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:48:00.345 --> 00:48:03.827]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:48:04.207 --> 00:48:06.709]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:48:06.769 --> 00:48:07.930]  Most people have no idea.
[00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:08.710]  They're not after money.
[00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:09.831]  They have all the money they need.
[00:48:10.011 --> 00:48:10.732]  They're after power.
[00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:11.832]  That's what happens here.

[00:48:20.518 --> 00:48:21.199]  In Game.
[00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:23.420]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.701]  You have been warned.
[00:48:29.364 --> 00:48:36.109]  Yeah.
[00:48:36.629 --> 00:48:50.399]  If we give in to this intimidation against the First Amendment and political speech that is the most protected, and allow them to persecute people for free speech, you will turn into North Korea and Guatemala overnight.
[00:48:50.899 --> 00:48:52.240]  Your life will be over.
[00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:58.165]  And the establishment is coming right out saying, you don't criticize the government, it's racist.
[00:48:59.045 --> 00:49:00.505]  You don't own guns, it's evil.
[00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:03.986]  You don't want to abolish the Fed, it's terrorist.
[00:49:04.726 --> 00:49:06.846]  You were going to finish up with a final quote.
[00:49:08.086 --> 00:49:11.347]  You know, from Victor Hugo, no army can stop an idea.
[00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:14.047]  Time has come, and for us that idea is liberty, and it's here.
[00:49:14.467 --> 00:49:15.328]  And it's not going away.
[00:49:15.348 --> 00:49:16.308]  Great job.
[00:49:16.388 --> 00:49:17.148]  Live free or die.
[00:49:17.668 --> 00:49:18.448]  Live free or die.
[00:49:18.508 --> 00:49:22.989]  Well, and of course, I'm going to challenge Fox News and the media
[00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:36.041]  To go ahead and give you a call and to make sure that they get it straight that this is all a media hoax, that the police admitted this was selective enforcement to you.
[00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:36.802]  God bless you.
[00:49:37.462 --> 00:49:37.862]  Have a good day.
[00:49:38.482 --> 00:49:38.823]  You bet.
[00:49:40.103 --> 00:49:41.284]  Here is the winner.
[00:49:42.884 --> 00:49:48.207]  And later in the next hour, after I take some phone calls, I will give you the other second and third place winners.
[00:49:49.527 --> 00:49:52.889]  But the winner is the San Francisco entry.
[00:49:54.178 --> 00:50:00.323]  And we'll give you their YouTube channel after we play part of this, because they did it in the most artful way.
[00:50:00.724 --> 00:50:05.788]  The camera work, the way they shot it, everybody agrees.
[00:50:05.848 --> 00:50:09.531]  I've read the comments on all the different stories about it, that this is the best.
[00:50:09.571 --> 00:50:10.252]  This is the winner.
[00:50:10.792 --> 00:50:15.616]  There were so many other great ones, but you know it's a winner when it's not a hard decision.
[00:50:16.017 --> 00:50:17.118]  Everybody else did a great job.
[00:50:17.158 --> 00:50:19.600]  Here's first place, San Francisco.
[00:50:21.107 --> 00:50:24.028]  The Obama Joker Contest InfoWars.com winners.
[00:50:24.068 --> 00:50:24.428]  Here it is.
[00:50:24.468 --> 00:50:34.050]  I will narrate this for some of the radio listeners who can't see it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:38.891]  That they're putting them up at the United Nations.
[00:50:49.602 --> 00:50:50.643]  Putting it up at the CFR.
[00:50:50.703 --> 00:50:56.766]  Putting them up at... The signs depict President Barack Obama as the Joker or Clown.
[00:50:57.126 --> 00:51:01.549]  Residents have filed reports with the local police and called the city demanding they come down.
[00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.732]  Is a poster of the President as the Joker racist?
[00:51:10.554 --> 00:51:16.578]  Police say whoever is responsible for gluing the posters on signs and posts around town could be charged with criminal misconduct.
[00:51:35.137 --> 00:51:36.138]  He puts them up at Bohemian Grove.
[00:51:36.158 --> 00:51:43.243]  He is so mean and gruesome and evil, and this is not something that you want to, as an American, to portray your president, no matter what you think.
[00:51:44.684 --> 00:51:51.570]  Socialists is becoming the new N-word for, frankly, for some angry, upset birthers and others.
[00:52:01.215 --> 00:52:03.597]  The Joker's an imaginary from a comic book.
[00:52:03.977 --> 00:52:08.141]  He didn't really steal 23.7 trillion of the American people's money.
[00:52:08.461 --> 00:52:10.022]  He didn't really actually do that.
[00:52:10.282 --> 00:52:13.204]  But Barack Obama and his criminal gang did.
[00:52:13.685 --> 00:52:15.666]  And that's why they are the real Jokers.
[00:52:33.788 --> 00:52:37.191]  21,000 plus views on YouTube, that's just one version of it.
[00:52:37.211 --> 00:52:41.534]  No doubt it reached hundreds of thousands all over the Bay Area and San Francisco.
[00:52:41.554 --> 00:52:42.675]  You know why they call him the Joker?
[00:52:43.235 --> 00:52:51.462]  Because it's a big joke to them that they're poisoning your water supply, and that your children are going to be informed and get cancer when they're 10 years old.
[00:52:51.482 --> 00:52:58.147]  Because it's a big joke to the New World Order, all the things they're doing to you, and how childlike you are.
[00:53:04.824 --> 00:53:07.267]  Alright, that is the winner.
[00:53:16.189 --> 00:53:21.193]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:53:21.413 --> 00:53:25.196]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:53:25.436 --> 00:53:31.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:31.781]  It's true.
[00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:36.204]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:53:36.405 --> 00:53:42.769]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:46.152]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:53:46.152 --> 00:53:46.832]  We're good.
[00:54:19.036 --> 00:54:20.977]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:21.438 --> 00:54:24.279]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:30.643 --> 00:54:31.283]  Big Brother.
[00:54:31.964 --> 00:54:33.024]  Mainstream media.
[00:54:33.725 --> 00:54:34.846]  Government cover-ups.
[00:54:35.486 --> 00:54:36.306]  You want answers?
[00:54:37.087 --> 00:54:38.588]  Well, so does he.
[00:54:38.628 --> 00:54:42.290]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:46.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:54:49.783 --> 00:54:52.934]  Okay, I'm gonna take your calls for the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:54:54.798 --> 00:55:00.882]  Tom, Billy, Lily, Mark, Jerry, we're going to continue when Bob Chapman with some economic updates comes in on the flu.
[00:55:01.322 --> 00:55:04.264]  I started the show with saying that Paul Watts is doing a big alert.
[00:55:05.024 --> 00:55:14.510]  Major British news as internal CDC documents, but I've already heard about this through the medical facilities, people we know in Houston, where they did the first trials a few weeks ago.
[00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.592]  It killed at least 25 people, and that's with the medical system covering it up.
[00:55:19.573 --> 00:55:20.494]  That is big news.
[00:55:21.354 --> 00:55:26.535]  The head of Health and Human Services, she needs to be asked at every press conference she gives about this.
[00:55:27.115 --> 00:55:29.336]  We need to force this issue out there with everybody.
[00:55:29.356 --> 00:55:30.996]  We're going to take your calls right now.
[00:55:31.096 --> 00:55:37.398]  Rand Paul's popping in for like five minutes coming up, but then we'll go back to your calls because he's having an event in Austin and they wanted to come on.
[00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:38.058]  We're glad to have him.
[00:55:38.498 --> 00:55:40.178]  Tom in Boston, you're on the air.
[00:55:40.238 --> 00:55:40.639]  Go ahead.
[00:55:42.139 --> 00:55:49.161]  Yeah, Alex, I was in Logan Airport the other day and I was standing in line in the security checkpoint.
[00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:50.981]  There's a guy in front of me sneezing.
[00:55:51.687 --> 00:55:55.490]  And the airline people that work there, they get to cut in line in front of you.
[00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:07.717]  And it was funny, they were standing next to me and they're making a comment saying, oh, we can't wait till there's proof that people have been vaccinated because we don't like standing in line basically with people sneezing.
[00:56:08.538 --> 00:56:17.684]  As I approached up to the woman, I went through the metal detector and there was a woman standing there with two pieces of paper in her hand and she said,
[00:56:18.092 --> 00:56:19.012]  Put out your hands.
[00:56:19.113 --> 00:56:19.973]  And I said, why?
[00:56:19.993 --> 00:56:23.354]  She says, we're collecting random samples.
[00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:24.535]  And I said, of what?
[00:56:24.995 --> 00:56:26.236]  And she didn't have an answer.
[00:56:26.276 --> 00:56:27.697]  She said, just put out your hands.
[00:56:28.257 --> 00:56:29.657]  See, this is huge news.
[00:56:30.458 --> 00:56:35.440]  I flew two days ago, three days ago, and then flew back yesterday, the day before.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.801]  The point is, I flew this week.
[00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:42.883]  And at the Austin Airport, they had signs about, we're doing stuff for the flu, you may be questioned.
[00:56:42.903 --> 00:56:45.444]  And I wondered what that was.
[00:56:45.905 --> 00:56:48.026]  And this is what Bill Clinton's executive order said.
[00:56:48.046 --> 00:56:50.868]  When you get a driver's license, they're going to take DNA and blood.
[00:56:50.928 --> 00:56:53.089]  That's now law, according to the U.S.
[00:56:53.129 --> 00:56:54.310]  Code and executive orders.
[00:56:54.410 --> 00:57:02.836]  It's totally unconstitutional, but it's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, made 12 years ago, and it's on the books.
[00:57:02.976 --> 00:57:06.178]  But you're telling me they're basically taking DNA?
[00:57:06.398 --> 00:57:07.319]  Where did this happen again?
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:16.613]  Logan Airport, and again, it was pretty funny because when I started questioning the woman, she couldn't look me in the eyes, Alex.
[00:57:16.673 --> 00:57:18.155]  She stared right down to the ground.
[00:57:18.496 --> 00:57:23.003]  Now granted, she was kind of a monkey, so she probably didn't really know what she was doing anyway.
[00:57:23.638 --> 00:57:27.720]  But I refused to do it and they let me go.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:32.502]  However, I turned back as I was putting my clothes back on after being violated.
[00:57:33.022 --> 00:57:39.065]  And sure enough, at least four or five people put their hands out and they took DNA from their hands.
[00:57:39.205 --> 00:57:40.546]  Sir, this is off the chart.
[00:57:40.806 --> 00:57:42.247]  Can you set up a camera?
[00:57:42.947 --> 00:57:43.807]  I don't want to be too mean.
[00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:44.848]  I don't think we need these TSA checkpoints.
[00:57:44.868 --> 00:57:45.468]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:45.988]  It's federal.
[00:57:46.008 --> 00:57:47.508]  It's to train you to be a slave.
[00:57:47.528 --> 00:57:47.888]  But, in L.A.
[00:57:47.908 --> 00:57:49.189]  both times I've flown last month,
[00:58:07.216 --> 00:58:08.477]  In Austin both times.
[00:58:08.577 --> 00:58:17.883]  The TSA guys are all fans coming up, getting autographs, shaking my hand and saying they've gone to my events, watched my films.
[00:58:18.444 --> 00:58:19.665]  They're all nodding at me.
[00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:21.826]  They kind of halfway search people.
[00:58:22.487 --> 00:58:27.150]  So in LA both times and in Austin the last two times.
[00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:28.411]  That's four times I've flown.
[00:58:29.178 --> 00:58:31.898]  You know, flying there, flying back, flying there, flying back.
[00:58:31.939 --> 00:58:32.439]  Two trips.
[00:58:33.159 --> 00:58:34.639]  Both times they're fans.
[00:58:35.279 --> 00:58:40.680]  I had LAPD cops, after I went to the checkpoint, go, hi Alex, and smile at me.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.961]  LAPD, I mean, the checkpoint guys are fans.
[00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:44.261]  The cops are fans.
[00:58:44.561 --> 00:58:46.661]  They, I mean, it's incredible.
[00:58:46.821 --> 00:58:52.222]  I mean, so they all know it's a load of, look, I'm telling you, man, this country is on the edge of revolution.
[00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:56.243]  I'm just little old Alex Jones, and all these people are waking up.
[00:58:57.003 --> 00:58:57.363]  I don't know.
[00:59:15.712 --> 00:59:20.817]  I mean, I'll let them arrest me and take me to court because I am not going to have them with a naked image of my body.
[00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:25.141]  They already have cameras that do it from a distance anyways, but it's making you submit to them.
[00:59:25.181 --> 00:59:25.521]  Stay there.
[00:59:25.801 --> 00:59:26.922]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.203 --> 00:59:28.984]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[00:59:29.184 --> 00:59:29.845]  Well, you should.
[00:59:30.165 --> 00:59:34.409]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:59:34.649 --> 00:59:35.110]  That's right.
[00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:45.356]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:59:45.476 --> 00:59:52.460]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:59.345]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:59:59.705 --> 01:00:04.888]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:06.369]  This is real.
[01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:07.409]  Don't miss out.

[01:00:26.513 --> 01:00:29.115]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:00:29.515 --> 01:00:34.479]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:36.581]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:41.725]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:42.866]  How much do you want?
[01:00:43.086 --> 01:00:43.826]  When do you want it?
[01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.808]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:00:46.088 --> 01:00:46.929]  When will you need it?
[01:00:47.169 --> 01:00:49.231]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:50.472]  Will there be any food?
[01:00:50.712 --> 01:00:52.013]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:00:52.233 --> 01:00:57.299]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:00:57.479 --> 01:01:00.683]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:01:01.084 --> 01:01:04.568]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:01:04.888 --> 01:01:05.889]  How much will you need?
[01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:06.730]  We don't know.
[01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:07.952]  How much do you want?
[01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:08.873]  All you can get.
[01:01:09.053 --> 01:01:09.874]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:10.355]  I think.
[01:01:25.512 --> 01:01:30.699]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:01:30.819 --> 01:01:35.205]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:01:35.365 --> 01:01:37.208]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:01:37.648 --> 01:01:38.990]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:40.292]  There is a solution.
[01:01:40.512 --> 01:01:48.533]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:02:27.378 --> 01:02:29.598]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:33.219]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:45.102 --> 01:02:51.523]  The caller is holding Tom in Boston went through Boston Logan where they even have passive brain scan MRIs in Logan.
[01:02:52.426 --> 01:02:53.427]  In fact, people won't believe me.
[01:02:53.447 --> 01:02:55.750]  Google for folks, brain scanners at airports.
[01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:57.151]  It'll be CBS News.
[01:02:57.972 --> 01:03:04.619]  Now they put you through these body scanners, and I... First time I've heard they're taking samples for flu when you're there.
[01:03:04.639 --> 01:03:10.766]  I knew they were testing people that looked like they were sick, which then sets this medical mafia up.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.641]  And I was talking to Rand Paul, who's going to be in Austin tonight.
[01:03:14.661 --> 01:03:16.242]  He's down in Lake Charles right now.
[01:03:16.262 --> 01:03:18.943]  He's going to be here at 6 o'clock tonight for a speech and event.
[01:03:18.983 --> 01:03:20.184]  I wish I could be there, but I can't.
[01:03:20.504 --> 01:03:21.484]  But my folks will be there.
[01:03:21.504 --> 01:03:22.445]  I hope everybody goes.
[01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:24.906]  The money bomb was a huge success yesterday.
[01:03:25.226 --> 01:03:26.566]  You could still give to it.
[01:03:26.967 --> 01:03:28.567]  And I wanted to have him pop in about that.
[01:03:28.607 --> 01:03:34.210]  But first, since we were talking during the break, Rand Paul, Dr. Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, running for the Senate in Kentucky.
[01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:38.232]  You've already raised more money than your competition.
[01:03:38.453 --> 01:03:44.436]  We're going to get to that, but first, your take on this airport situation where they're training us how to be good little slaves.
[01:03:45.477 --> 01:03:56.244]  Well, I think we need to stand up to authority and there have to be some among us who are willing to take a stand to stop the system, challenge it in court, and really be vocal about it.
[01:03:56.725 --> 01:04:00.207]  You know, it was really great when one of my dad's campaign staff
[01:04:00.888 --> 01:04:03.671]  And then by him standing up, it totally blew up in the establishment's face.
[01:04:21.147 --> 01:04:31.794]  Right, and that was right on the heels of all that targeting of Ron Paul and freedom lovers in Missouri, and he was coming through that Missouri airport, so I think that really did backfire on him.
[01:04:32.275 --> 01:04:41.381]  And I think the whole idea of political profiling, that in our country your political thought process is going to make you a target for the government, is a scary concept.
[01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:45.034]  Absolutely, we got that MIAC report and broke it.
[01:04:45.054 --> 01:04:49.560]  We also broke the DHS report and people for the first week didn't believe it was real.
[01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:54.146]  Because it was so shocking to not just demonize your dad, but even Bob Barr.
[01:04:54.207 --> 01:04:57.231]  I mean, Bob Barr's an okay guy, but he's pretty milquetoast.
[01:04:58.735 --> 01:05:03.700]  Well, and actually going after all kinds of folks, going after people who believe in gun rights.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.123]  I mean, everybody was sort of lumped in there, and it's amazing.
[01:05:08.144 --> 01:05:16.652]  Sort of the strangest bit of all is you've got to watch out for those people who believe in the Constitution as being some evildoers.
[01:05:18.345 --> 01:05:19.726]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:19.746 --> 01:05:23.931]  There's just so many questions, but I don't want to keep you too long because I know you're busy.
[01:05:24.511 --> 01:05:29.276]  Specifically, tell us about the money bomb yesterday and what it's raised.
[01:05:29.336 --> 01:05:30.057]  It's continuing.
[01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:31.258]  Money is still pouring in.
[01:05:32.634 --> 01:05:36.235]  We set a record yesterday for online fundraising in Kentucky.
[01:05:36.315 --> 01:05:39.557]  No one has ever raised this much money in one day online.
[01:05:39.637 --> 01:05:50.761]  We raised about $440,000 in one day online, and probably with the carryover effect today, we may get close to a half a million in a two-day period.
[01:05:51.385 --> 01:05:51.565]  Well,
[01:06:06.636 --> 01:06:11.580]  I want to be honest with people out there.
[01:06:12.822 --> 01:06:22.710]  During the campaign, your dad's biggest reason for not wanting to run when people were pressuring him to do it was that he said, look, if I don't win, people will be disappointed.
[01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:24.032]  I can be a congressman.
[01:06:24.072 --> 01:06:25.393]  I can continue to introduce bills.
[01:06:27.526 --> 01:06:37.998]  But then I and many others made the point, and he's even given me credit, which I'm honored by, saying I pressured him, other people pressured him, and said, look, you've got to do this because you're going to get the word out.
[01:06:38.038 --> 01:06:46.988]  You're going to inject real issues into the debate, and then as everything you talk about comes true down the road, that's going to really build the liberty movement.
[01:06:47.689 --> 01:06:53.491]  And as your father has said, Congressman Ron Paul, this has blown up hundreds of times bigger than he ever imagined.
[01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:54.691]  But I did envision it.
[01:06:55.352 --> 01:06:59.833]  I understood what was there grassroots and the move to audit the Fed and what was happening.
[01:07:00.253 --> 01:07:02.034]  And I also told my listeners, I said, look,
[01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:03.934]  He probably won't win.
[01:07:04.414 --> 01:07:09.537]  But you've got to fight as hard as you can, as if he could, because we do win in getting the word out.
[01:07:09.978 --> 01:07:16.262]  And it's not going to be a loss if you give him these money bombs, and then he doesn't win, because it's educating people.
[01:07:16.302 --> 01:07:23.406]  And now, the biggest movement on colleges is now liberty movement, freedom movement, anti-globalist, anti-fed.
[01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:25.388]  We're shifting the whole paradigm.
[01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:33.090]  Right now and so you've actually got a chance to win a lot better chance than your dad did his first big run for president as a Republican.
[01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:43.994]  I know he ran as Libertarian before that in the 70s and so are the 80s so you have got a huge chance to win especially since the other fellow the incumbent isn't running.
[01:07:44.274 --> 01:07:48.135]  I know you know that Rand I just want to make sure listeners know that
[01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:57.599]  If we don't put our money on the line, and our energy on our line, and our voices on the line, and our treasure on the line, we don't have a hope in hell here.
[01:07:57.959 --> 01:07:59.680]  We have got to get behind you.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:08.303]  And the other thing about it is, we couldn't do it, I couldn't be anywhere near where I am now without the Patriot Movement that supported my dad.
[01:08:08.803 --> 01:08:10.764]  And without that movement, we couldn't do this.
[01:08:10.824 --> 01:08:15.386]  But you're right, we can take it to another level, and we can win this race this time.
[01:08:15.406 --> 01:08:25.050]  And if people will go look at our website, RandPaul2010.com, you'll see how big that money bomb was yesterday, and hopefully people will get it excited and keep it going.
[01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:32.291]  Absolutely, and I like Peter Schiff, but I really like you, and especially the name, Paul.
[01:08:32.351 --> 01:08:36.592]  Plus, you're a smart, intelligent, have basically the same views, constitutional views, as your father.
[01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.312]  It's now at $683,000.
[01:08:38.352 --> 01:08:38.312]  $683,835.
[01:08:38.372 --> 01:08:39.293]  A lot of mails coming in.
[01:08:39.313 --> 01:08:43.273]  We need to make sure this is a million by the end of the day, or at least by the end of the weekend.
[01:08:43.293 --> 01:08:43.954]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:08:43.974 --> 01:08:46.214]  Peter Schiff, what, raised $870-something thousand dollars?
[01:08:56.016 --> 01:08:56.796]  And that's great.
[01:08:57.177 --> 01:08:58.037]  We supported that.
[01:08:58.918 --> 01:09:03.520]  But Rand Paul, I mean, he's got a real super shot here.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.801]  He needs to raise more money than Peter Schiff.
[01:09:05.861 --> 01:09:08.002]  I mean, I think that's another challenge out there.
[01:09:09.243 --> 01:09:11.604]  I think Peter Schiff is also a great candidate.
[01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:13.044]  I've met him a couple of times.
[01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:19.628]  And I think we have two good chances, really, at least there, as well as we've got a lot of other Liberty candidates out there that have a shot.
[01:09:20.028 --> 01:09:22.309]  So I say, yes, let's keep the movement going.
[01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:24.390]  Let's stoke the fire, stoke the flame.
[01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:33.132]  But we've got a lot of movement going on, and this is going to now give us the chance to really begin a full-fledged campaign.
[01:09:33.152 --> 01:09:35.493]  And we've got them scared.
[01:09:35.533 --> 01:09:36.813]  You can see it in their eyes.
[01:09:36.853 --> 01:09:45.716]  When I used to see them at these picnics, I'd see overconfidence, this sort of imperiousness that they were going to win with no race at all.
[01:09:46.056 --> 01:09:47.336]  And now I see that they're worried.
[01:09:47.396 --> 01:09:49.777]  I see crowds congregating on our side.
[01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:52.240]  We have volunteers show up at a picnic.
[01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.445]  We've got as many or more than the other guy every time now.
[01:09:55.465 --> 01:10:03.777]  I think it was Julius Caesar said there is a tide in the fortunes of men when taken
[01:10:05.194 --> 01:10:07.215]  at the flood leads on to fortune.
[01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:15.921]  I would just change that and say there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to liberty and freedom for future generations.
[01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.483]  And we have the giant Tea Party movement.
[01:10:18.723 --> 01:10:23.326]  We have this bipartisan movement against the globalists, against the foreign banks.
[01:10:23.546 --> 01:10:29.130]  People are now identifying that both political parties are by and large controlled by offshore corporations.
[01:10:29.911 --> 01:10:34.314]  And if we can get you in the Senate and have you with that bully pulpit
[01:10:35.195 --> 01:10:36.377]  In there blowing the whistle.
[01:10:36.598 --> 01:10:38.001]  And I believe you won't be compromised.
[01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:40.808]  I believe you'll be 100% faithful like your father.
[01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:42.893]  Then...
[01:10:44.184 --> 01:11:09.859]  It'll just be amazing to have two polls in the Congress as a wedge to blast open the gates for more candidates, because as people learn that we can have victory, as they learn that the New World Order isn't as invincible as they have portrayed themselves, as the aura of invincibility and imperial hubris of the Federal Reserve now evaporates, the people smell blood, and it is contagious.
[01:11:09.919 --> 01:11:11.260]  So I can't stress enough
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.102]  How important this race for the Kentucky Senate is.
[01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:18.103]  A senator is really a national position.
[01:11:18.223 --> 01:11:22.406]  Obviously, you'll be representing Kentucky, but it deals with national issues.
[01:11:22.826 --> 01:11:24.367]  Can you comment along that line, sir?
[01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:26.970]  Well, what I would say is that you're right.
[01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:36.233]  The amazing thing is, you know, we've had our small remnant that's been growing through the years, the freedom movement, the liberty-loving movement, the limited government crowd.
[01:11:36.673 --> 01:11:49.957]  But I sense it getting bigger and bigger because when I see patients who come into my office who are not part of our movement, but they're just part of the general public, they sit down in the chair and they look at me and they say, I am worried.
[01:11:50.543 --> 01:11:51.844]  There is an unease.
[01:11:51.904 --> 01:11:55.007]  There is a discontent that is growing among the people.
[01:11:55.487 --> 01:11:58.089]  And it's not just our small movement anymore.
[01:11:58.549 --> 01:12:00.611]  It's spreading throughout the public.
[01:12:01.031 --> 01:12:02.773]  And it's going to be something big.
[01:12:02.813 --> 01:12:06.836]  And if we tap into it, we have a chance to really take back our country.
[01:12:08.177 --> 01:12:08.637]  Amazing.
[01:12:08.678 --> 01:12:11.460]  Tell folks where you're speaking tonight in Austin and how folks can go.
[01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:14.022]  Well, I'll be in Austin.
[01:12:14.202 --> 01:12:23.606]  It's at a private home, but you can come and you can RSVP if you'll just get on our website, RandPaul2010.com, and there's an Austin fundraiser this evening.
[01:12:23.646 --> 01:12:24.846]  It's not that expensive.
[01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:30.928]  I think it's $25 per person, and you can RSVP just by getting on the website, and we're happy to have you.
[01:12:31.989 --> 01:12:32.749]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:12:32.769 --> 01:12:34.630]  And then you're going to be in other parts of the country now.
[01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:38.532]  Folks can find out more at RandPaul2010.com.
[01:12:38.572 --> 01:12:39.172]  That's right.
[01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:46.091]  All right, well, we really appreciate you running for the Senate.
[01:12:46.811 --> 01:12:48.072]  I know you're taking on a lot.
[01:12:48.112 --> 01:12:49.512]  I know it was a big family decision.
[01:12:50.013 --> 01:12:52.554]  You know, folks, it's a lot to ask these people to run.
[01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:54.095]  It was a lot to ask his father to run.
[01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:57.457]  I mean, you get a lot of heat, a lot of attacks, a lot of work.
[01:12:58.017 --> 01:13:05.701]  I would imagine deep down it'd be easier just to stay there in your medical practice and spend time with the family, but you know you're doing this for your family's future.
[01:13:07.045 --> 01:13:09.486]  Yeah, I think we really don't have a lot of time.
[01:13:09.546 --> 01:13:24.275]  I mean, I think the deficit has become so large, they've printed so much money, there's been such an expansion of credit, that I fear that if there's a destruction of the currency, that during that chaos is when really bad things can happen.
[01:13:24.295 --> 01:13:28.878]  You know, that's what happened when we got Hitler in Germany, was during the destruction of the currency.
[01:13:29.578 --> 01:13:33.761]  And if we have a really catastrophic or a panic in the currency here,
[01:13:34.321 --> 01:13:45.406]  We need to have people in place in office who will be talking about protecting us, following the rule of law, the Constitution, and not saying, give me more power.
[01:13:45.466 --> 01:13:52.909]  If I only had more power against these evil people, if we put these people in prison, you know, we can make you safe again.
[01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:54.610]  You know, all that security.
[01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:56.070]  We just need more security.
[01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:00.212]  And if you get some kind of strong leader like that, then it's all over for the Republic.
[01:14:01.192 --> 01:14:05.336]  Dr. Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, running for the U.S.
[01:14:05.376 --> 01:14:06.617]  Senate out of Kentucky.
[01:14:06.677 --> 01:14:07.477]  You drafted him.
[01:14:07.758 --> 01:14:08.438]  He's doing it.
[01:14:08.698 --> 01:14:11.381]  Now put your money and your time and energy where your mouth is.
[01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:15.364]  We win hands down because resistance is victory.
[01:14:15.704 --> 01:14:17.326]  Doctor, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:14:17.346 --> 01:14:18.106]  We're going to let you go.
[01:14:18.126 --> 01:14:22.770]  We're going to come back and take your calls on the flu hype straight ahead.
[01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:23.471]  Stay with us.
[01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:31.281]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:14:31.402 --> 01:14:36.865]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[01:14:37.045 --> 01:14:38.146]  The answer is simple.
[01:14:38.446 --> 01:14:39.767]  PureBulk.com.
[01:14:40.007 --> 01:14:48.873]  PureBulk.com has over 150 bulk wholesale nutritional products in stock, including vitamins, super antioxidants, amino acids, and herbal extracts.
[01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:54.797]  PureBulk.com's products contain no fillers, no additives, no fancy retail packaging, and no minimum purchase,
[01:14:56.118 --> 01:14:56.418]  We're good.
[01:15:26.246 --> 01:15:27.667]  It is a big idea.
[01:15:27.687 --> 01:15:29.789]  A New World Order.
[01:15:30.489 --> 01:15:35.133]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:15:35.393 --> 01:15:38.176]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:15:38.216 --> 01:15:40.478]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:15:40.998 --> 01:15:43.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:15:44.181 --> 01:15:51.527]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:15:54.522 --> 01:15:59.505]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:15:59.966 --> 01:16:03.468]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:16:03.848 --> 01:16:06.330]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:07.551]  Most people have no idea.
[01:16:07.571 --> 01:16:08.331]  They're not after money.
[01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:09.452]  They have all the money they need.
[01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:10.373]  They're after power.
[01:16:10.613 --> 01:16:11.473]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:16:20.139 --> 01:16:20.880]  In Game.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.961]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:16:23.301 --> 01:16:24.382]  You have been warned.
[01:16:25.663 --> 01:16:26.023]  Good day.
[01:16:26.204 --> 01:16:27.705]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:28.466]  August 21st, 2009.
[01:16:28.526 --> 01:16:29.507]  Gold opened this morning at $948.
[01:16:29.547 --> 01:16:32.650]  A one-ounce gold coin to be purchased for $975.12, $487.56 for the half-ounce, or $243.78 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:33.290]  That's $975.12, $487.56, and $243.78.
[01:16:45.231 --> 01:16:58.779]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:16:58.859 --> 01:17:07.504]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, the central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:17:07.704 --> 01:17:08.665]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:17:08.785 --> 01:17:12.867]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.

[01:17:19.432 --> 01:17:22.274]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:18:41.595 --> 01:18:49.820]  Alright, I know I haven't even gone to these calls yet.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.542]  Tom, Bill, Lizzie, Mark, Jerry.
[01:18:52.842 --> 01:18:55.464]  We're getting to you in this segment and the next, even though Chapman's coming up.
[01:18:55.904 --> 01:18:57.746]  We just keep jam-packing the show with all these guests.
[01:18:59.898 --> 01:19:05.299]  Tom, finishing up, please write a blurb up with the description of what happened to you where.
[01:19:05.879 --> 01:19:08.000]  Send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:13.441]  I'll get one of my writers to put it into an article because we were doing searches.
[01:19:13.481 --> 01:19:15.981]  Did you guys find anything about him taking DNA at the airports?
[01:19:17.302 --> 01:19:17.962]  I don't think so.
[01:19:18.502 --> 01:19:19.742]  So, that's big news.
[01:19:19.842 --> 01:19:20.622]  I believe you.
[01:19:21.062 --> 01:19:22.543]  We need to follow up on that tip.
[01:19:23.043 --> 01:19:23.983]  Now, anything else, Tom?
[01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:32.313]  Yeah, I couldn't find anything when I got home and Googled it, and that's why I'm calling you just to see if you had heard anything.
[01:19:33.293 --> 01:19:43.775]  Just my luck, the airline personnel that cut in line actually were the stewardess and steward on my plane, so I was the topic of conversation.
[01:19:44.675 --> 01:19:48.316]  Several times they'd walk by, oh, there's the guy who refused the test.
[01:19:49.099 --> 01:19:52.942]  And so I pulled this stewardess over and I said, well, wait a minute.
[01:19:53.262 --> 01:19:55.624]  She couldn't even explain to me what the test was.
[01:19:55.985 --> 01:19:59.888]  Why would I submit to something that I don't even know what she's doing or what it's for?
[01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:04.107]  And they said, well, it's for the good of everybody.
[01:20:04.187 --> 01:20:05.228]  You should have just done it.
[01:20:05.248 --> 01:20:06.169]  Well, I gotta say this.
[01:20:06.329 --> 01:20:10.334]  Even worse than the TSA are the stewardesses, the flight attendants.
[01:20:11.275 --> 01:20:12.276]  Some of them are real nice.
[01:20:12.316 --> 01:20:13.177]  Some of them are fans.
[01:20:13.257 --> 01:20:15.800]  I've run into them on flights to England, flights to New York.
[01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:18.583]  But a lot of them are on Nazi power trips.
[01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:26.807]  And they love bullying people around and I mean, you know, it's just again the airport is being used to train us for everything.
[01:20:27.207 --> 01:20:31.669]  Write it up in a two paragraph, three paragraph blurb or longer if you want.
[01:20:32.129 --> 01:20:32.749]  Send it to us.
[01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:33.569]  God bless you.
[01:20:33.589 --> 01:20:34.990]  We're gonna try to track that down, Tom.
[01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.910]  Thank you for your help, sir.
[01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:37.471]  Have a great day.
[01:20:37.711 --> 01:20:38.131]  Thank you.
[01:20:38.691 --> 01:20:40.212]  Just amazing right there.
[01:20:40.772 --> 01:20:41.932]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:20:41.952 --> 01:20:42.472]  You're on the air.
[01:20:42.512 --> 01:20:43.073]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:20:43.713 --> 01:20:44.673]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:20:44.753 --> 01:20:45.814]  How are you doing today?
[01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:46.674]  Good, my friend.
[01:20:47.319 --> 01:20:52.523]  Okay, I'm a county supervisor here in Wisconsin.
[01:20:52.643 --> 01:21:02.550]  One of the committee assignments that I was given when I was elected a few years back was for the County Health Board.
[01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:15.599]  And as a believer in alternative medicine, I've been very perplexed and alarmed by the things that I've seen over the years.
[01:21:16.266 --> 01:21:26.313]  I've come to the conclusion that Len Horowitz and all of his information that public health is a genocide program is correct.
[01:21:27.233 --> 01:21:33.217]  Now, yesterday we had a pandemic meeting, and I've been going to all of these meetings.
[01:21:37.947 --> 01:21:46.415]  Oh, one of the local prisons for juvenile youth, and we were out getting an update on what their plans were.
[01:21:47.216 --> 01:21:57.566]  But at every one of these meetings, I bring out information that you've had, or Dr. Tenpenny, or the Crusader out of Florida.
[01:21:57.586 --> 01:22:02.951]  You know, I bring it up at the meetings, and I get it right in their face.
[01:22:03.926 --> 01:22:13.288]  Paul, I mean, did you hear Dr. Blaylock, brain surgeon, talking about how it's killing people and how there's no doubt that it's just absolutely horrible?
[01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.428]  Well, I didn't hear that.
[01:22:15.488 --> 01:22:18.289]  I'm going to have a friend archive that for me.
[01:22:19.449 --> 01:22:21.310]  You know, I understand.
[01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:27.711]  Yesterday I brought out about the Guillain-Barré syndrome and so forth.
[01:22:28.942 --> 01:22:36.284]  You know, I kept hitting that the World Health Organization is going to make this thing a mandatory.
[01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:37.485]  And no, no, no, no.
[01:22:37.565 --> 01:22:38.785]  Everything's voluntary.
[01:22:39.466 --> 01:22:58.592]  But the local fire chief from the city closest by made the statement, you know, that he would have great problems with any kind of mandatory vaccination, and that he and his group of firefighters
[01:22:59.164 --> 01:23:04.488]  Would go into litigation, so I thought this was a very encouraging sign.
[01:23:05.349 --> 01:23:24.603]  You know, so, and I cannot emphasize enough that as I talk about building the immune system and doing things on a natural basis to prepare yourself for whatever might be coming, they don't want to hear that at all.
[01:23:25.144 --> 01:23:26.765]  All they're concerned with here
[01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:37.769]  Are these shots or the Tamiflu and you bring up all the negatives about it and it's just off their heads.
[01:23:38.089 --> 01:23:40.489]  Yeah, they just idiotically want to take a vaccine.
[01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:47.651]  You ought to print off the Sunday Mail and all these other newspapers where it's killing people.
[01:23:48.871 --> 01:23:54.513]  Right, well, I did give them that information and in past meetings
[01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:59.352]  I had all the Baxter information, so... And they still don't care.
[01:23:59.412 --> 01:24:00.732]  They still think it's wonderful.
[01:24:00.772 --> 01:24:10.238]  Well, you know, there are people there listening, and occasionally someone will pipe up and say, well, I agree with that gentleman.
[01:24:10.258 --> 01:24:11.979]  All right, Bill, always good to hear from you.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.320]  County Commissioner.
[01:24:16.182 --> 01:24:17.162]  We're on the march.
[01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:19.184]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:24:20.104 --> 01:24:22.806]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:25.421 --> 01:24:29.405]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:24:29.645 --> 01:24:31.427]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:39.935]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:45.401]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:47.363]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:53.927]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:24:54.107 --> 01:25:04.855]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:25:05.155 --> 01:25:05.655]  That's right.
[01:25:05.935 --> 01:25:08.237]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:25:08.497 --> 01:25:10.138]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:25:10.198 --> 01:25:10.478]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:26.466]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:25:26.747 --> 01:25:28.527]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:25:28.727 --> 01:25:29.428]  Well, you should.
[01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:33.969]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:25:34.209 --> 01:25:34.690]  That's right.
[01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:44.933]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:25:45.033 --> 01:25:46.174]  Plus, if you act fast,
[01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:51.997]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:25:52.357 --> 01:25:58.881]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:04.444]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:26:04.764 --> 01:26:05.924]  This is real.
[01:26:06.225 --> 01:26:06.965]  Don't miss out.
[01:26:07.285 --> 01:26:15.668]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[01:26:18.209 --> 01:26:21.711]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:24.812]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:30.694]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:26:55.831 --> 01:26:56.411]  We're good.
[01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.433]  Oh, I was on the phone with the news media.
[01:28:10.514 --> 01:28:26.614]  And that reminds me, guys, that's why we gotta hire more people, because I gotta watch for infiltrators and... This is literally a cloak-and-dagger job I have, and I'm just out in the open, a good guy trying to tell the truth, and I gotta look out for everything, I gotta calculate what people are doing, I've gotta...
[01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:29.191]  Yeah, I'm not whining.
[01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:31.172]  It's just one hell of a responsibility.
[01:28:31.212 --> 01:28:32.352]  People talk about how they're bored.
[01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:33.153]  I'm the opposite.
[01:28:33.193 --> 01:28:34.553]  I got too much stimulus.
[01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.074]  Too much crazy stuff.
[01:28:36.634 --> 01:28:39.395]  I'm getting to the point where, oh boy, I'm getting tailed again.
[01:28:39.455 --> 01:28:42.636]  Or, you know, Fed's coming up to me doing stuff.
[01:28:42.696 --> 01:28:43.256]  It's just ongoing.
[01:28:45.846 --> 01:28:47.147]  Ongoing insanity.
[01:28:48.108 --> 01:28:50.630]  And I catch myself where nothing even affects me anymore.
[01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:52.331]  Like horrible things can be done to me.
[01:28:52.351 --> 01:28:53.732]  I don't even care anymore.
[01:28:54.433 --> 01:28:58.576]  And you'd think I'd want to be to that point of not caring, but it's like I've almost lost part of myself.
[01:28:59.016 --> 01:29:01.098]  Because I'm not even worried about being killed.
[01:29:01.538 --> 01:29:03.800]  I'm not even worried about being falsely imprisoned.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.403]  I'm not even worried about... I mean, all I'm worried about is other people.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.600]  And it's not like I'm some saint.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.581]  I care about my innocent children.
[01:29:11.741 --> 01:29:12.421]  That's the only thing.
[01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:19.723]  I look at how sweet and innocent they are, and other people's children, and I wonder how they grow into these evil adults that do all this bad crap.
[01:29:19.763 --> 01:29:30.025]  And none of us are perfect, but just the level of duplicity and envy and lying and everything else in society, and then how good people sit there and take it.
[01:29:30.205 --> 01:29:34.646]  And then all the positive things that are happening, the great leaps and bounds we're making,
[01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:38.334]  It's just all on overdrive.
[01:29:38.454 --> 01:29:54.879]  I'm gonna go to Lily, Mark, Jerry, Jeff, and others all on flu issues, and I'm gonna get Bob Chapman's take on that and some financial stuff, but Bob, you've been fighting the globalists since the early 1960s or even earlier, and you've worked and dealt with all of this.
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:30:03.762]  Have you ever gotten to the point where you start getting almost numb to things, and then it freaks you out, or is it different for you?
[01:30:05.842 --> 01:30:09.584]  Well, I think it's in part your personality.
[01:30:10.465 --> 01:30:17.129]  And I came to the conclusion that I could accept a lot of things that most other people couldn't.
[01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:21.772]  And so I really didn't have a hard time with it.
[01:30:22.532 --> 01:30:26.094]  It was, I think, because I approached it intellectually.
[01:30:27.215 --> 01:30:31.578]  And of course, I was on the street as well as a pamphleteer and all that sort of thing.
[01:30:34.297 --> 01:30:36.899]  I'm just different, and I just keep on going.
[01:30:36.959 --> 01:30:37.740]  I won't stop.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:51.369]  You know, I meet people who knew me as a child and chummed around with me, and they say, oh, well, we always knew that you were going to be something important because you never gave up.
[01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:53.651]  Well, absolutely.
[01:30:53.711 --> 01:30:54.752]  I'm not talking about that.
[01:30:54.792 --> 01:31:02.817]  I'm saying that I have this nothing but a passion to fight the globalists that's all-consuming to the point of
[01:31:03.951 --> 01:31:10.174]  I'm not, I don't even care at all about people lying about me or attacking me anymore.
[01:31:10.574 --> 01:31:12.756]  And it's almost like a blindness or something.
[01:31:13.076 --> 01:31:15.977]  It's like all these other understandings I have have expanded.
[01:31:15.997 --> 01:31:18.098]  I don't know how to describe it.
[01:31:18.118 --> 01:31:19.099]  It's just really weird.
[01:31:19.219 --> 01:31:20.400]  I know how to describe it.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:24.782]  You're accepting the fact that the enemy is always after you.
[01:31:25.462 --> 01:31:27.583]  And you're always exposing what they're doing.
[01:31:28.043 --> 01:31:28.924]  And you don't care.
[01:31:29.864 --> 01:31:31.205]  You don't care what they think.
[01:31:31.785 --> 01:31:32.926]  I don't care what they think.
[01:31:33.686 --> 01:31:35.548]  You just keep on plowing ahead.
[01:31:36.808 --> 01:31:42.213]  It's just weird, Bob, to truly become fearless.
[01:31:43.093 --> 01:31:45.235]  It's almost like I liked having a little fear.
[01:31:45.435 --> 01:31:46.596]  It's like I've lost something.
[01:31:47.397 --> 01:31:49.298]  But I guess you would say it's gaining something?
[01:31:50.519 --> 01:31:50.960]  Oh yes.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:53.361]  Because we've risen above them.
[01:31:54.062 --> 01:31:56.284]  And we're really giving them a bad time.
[01:31:57.004 --> 01:31:57.945]  And they deserve it.
[01:31:58.065 --> 01:31:59.286]  They're evil people.
[01:31:59.566 --> 01:32:02.849]  And we have the ability to do so, so we're going to do it.
[01:32:04.175 --> 01:32:10.217]  Well, speaking of waking up, I mean, every week we talk, the Liberty Movement is just exploding and exploding.
[01:32:10.597 --> 01:32:13.317]  National news, local news is calling for my arrest.
[01:32:13.858 --> 01:32:15.798]  Freedom of hate speech is the headline.
[01:32:17.278 --> 01:32:21.600]  For just putting up Obama posters that say Infowars.com.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:27.021]  I mean, the fact that we can shake these tyrants up so quickly.
[01:32:28.559 --> 01:32:30.140]  Really shows how weak they are.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:41.365]  They wouldn't be upset by this if they weren't weak and if they weren't scared of the people rising up and kicking their butts.
[01:32:44.426 --> 01:32:46.187]  They're wrong and we're getting to them.
[01:32:46.567 --> 01:32:49.509]  You gotta remember these broadcasts go all over the world.
[01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:58.133]  I mean I talked to people on the internet in Paris and London and all over the place.
[01:32:59.438 --> 01:33:04.082]  And, you know, we're doing a magnificent job of reaching the world.
[01:33:05.143 --> 01:33:11.788]  And these guys in the Council on Foreign Relations in the Royal Institute, they're going to be banging their heads against the wall.
[01:33:12.248 --> 01:33:15.290]  How can we get rid of these people without killing them?
[01:33:18.173 --> 01:33:22.256]  All right, I want to go to some flu calls so you can comment on what they're saying.
[01:33:25.675 --> 01:33:35.138]  Bob, they're now backing off partially, at least some reports saying they may not try to vaccinate the entire population now, but they are going to try to force it on school kids and other people.
[01:33:35.558 --> 01:33:41.921]  Then mainstream news in Europe, here's one of the articles, swine flu jab linked to killer nerve disease.
[01:33:42.941 --> 01:33:51.244]  Leaked letter reveals concern over neurologists over 25 deaths in America, mainly in Texas, just since they started trials.
[01:33:52.671 --> 01:33:56.412]  What, Bob, what are your ideas to get this out in U.S.
[01:33:56.472 --> 01:33:56.772]  media?
[01:33:56.832 --> 01:34:02.113]  I mean, the head of Health and Human Services should be asked this every time she's in a press conference.
[01:34:02.413 --> 01:34:14.196]  This should be top news story that they're getting ready to inoculate a hundred plus million people with something that's killing a large percentage of those that take it and the CDC knows it and is covering it up.
[01:34:14.896 --> 01:34:16.837]  Your take on that and how we get the word out.
[01:34:19.258 --> 01:34:20.038]  Well, first of all,
[01:34:23.001 --> 01:34:27.764]  They have to be doing something besides giving swine flu shots.
[01:34:27.784 --> 01:34:29.565]  There's got to be something else in there.
[01:34:30.986 --> 01:34:34.789]  They never do things in a unilateral manner.
[01:34:34.829 --> 01:34:43.415]  They always have more than one goal, usually several goals, when they take a program like this and push it forward.
[01:34:46.817 --> 01:34:50.079]  The worst thing that can happen is that they give it to the children.
[01:34:51.736 --> 01:35:02.360]  In the worst thing of all, my daughter's a teacher and she's got three children and she's not going to allow them to give this shot to them.
[01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:08.523]  And I said, well, if you do that, they may put you in internment camp.
[01:35:08.563 --> 01:35:09.323]  She said, I don't care.
[01:35:10.444 --> 01:35:11.404]  She's not going to get it.
[01:35:11.892 --> 01:35:15.755]  Well, I think it's because of that attitude that they're probably not going to get away with this.
[01:35:15.795 --> 01:35:23.361]  I already see some signs they're pulling back, but I don't want to say that too clearly because they may give us a curveball, try something else.
[01:35:23.401 --> 01:35:29.106]  They appear to be going full steam ahead, but I'm seeing such an awakening that we have a very good chance of stopping them.
[01:35:29.146 --> 01:35:34.370]  I mean, I want to be honest with people, but at the same time, then not have folks stand down and not get involved.
[01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:40.334]  If we go absolutely wild and post posters everywhere and say, don't take the flu shot and get involved,
[01:35:41.255 --> 01:35:49.277]  Then, they will be forced to back off and then not try it again in a few years, if our response is big enough against them.
[01:35:49.617 --> 01:35:55.399]  But, if we don't stand up and say no, they may go all the way to the wall with us with it, with the sterilants or whatever's in it.
[01:35:55.419 --> 01:35:56.699]  They've been caught before.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.500]  Or, they may stop now and try it a year from now.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.621]  What do you say to that, Bob?
[01:36:03.521 --> 01:36:05.202]  I say that we could do it.
[01:36:06.102 --> 01:36:08.182]  And, you've got the medium to do it.
[01:36:08.422 --> 01:36:10.383]  I have a minor part of that.
[01:36:11.055 --> 01:36:12.615]  We've got to keep on hammering.
[01:36:13.275 --> 01:36:14.616]  You see my health section.
[01:36:14.676 --> 01:36:15.956]  It's never been so big.
[01:36:16.736 --> 01:36:26.138]  I've got 20 links in the health section from all over the world explaining how these shots are dangerous and could very well kill you.
[01:36:26.158 --> 01:36:31.138]  We've got people in Europe who are spreading the information everywhere.
[01:36:32.099 --> 01:36:40.400]  And especially in Europe, the La Roche people are spreading the word that, you know, don't take the shots.
[01:36:41.351 --> 01:36:45.512]  And so, yes, word of mouth, everything that we can do.
[01:36:45.932 --> 01:36:51.733]  And I think you're right about the chinks in their armor.
[01:36:51.753 --> 01:36:55.234]  I think that they're in trouble with this one.
[01:36:55.494 --> 01:36:56.354]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:36:57.115 --> 01:36:58.315]  Because they're in trouble.
[01:36:58.335 --> 01:37:03.596]  We had a Rasmussen poll, a 44 approval rating on the president.
[01:37:04.256 --> 01:37:06.557]  I think the Congress has a 12 rating.
[01:37:08.012 --> 01:37:09.233]  Yeah, I forgot to go over that.
[01:37:09.293 --> 01:37:12.836]  Guys, will you pull up the Rasmussen 44 or 43?
[01:37:13.136 --> 01:37:15.779]  I saw that this morning and forgot to print it.
[01:37:16.199 --> 01:37:16.719]  What's the number?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.361]  Well, I didn't see this morning's.
[01:37:20.062 --> 01:37:21.463]  Well, I saw the article this morning.
[01:37:21.483 --> 01:37:22.224]  When did that come out?
[01:37:23.865 --> 01:37:24.526]  I don't know.
[01:37:25.447 --> 01:37:26.968]  Yeah, no, but I saw the Rasmussen.
[01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.549]  I think it was 44 or 43.
[01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:31.552]  Just Google President's Approval now at 44 or 43.
[01:37:32.593 --> 01:37:33.153]  It should bring it up.
[01:37:33.173 --> 01:37:36.356]  But yeah, I mean, he's losing a couple points a week, Bob.
[01:37:37.372 --> 01:37:38.633]  Well, this is a syndrome.
[01:37:38.693 --> 01:37:43.336]  Incidentally, I predicted 40 by September, October, in January.
[01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:44.977]  I'm done with this one.
[01:37:45.677 --> 01:38:01.086]  But he's got this medical plan, and I'm sure that they'll have some crummy medical plan passed, but most of the stuff that people are complaining about won't be in there.
[01:38:02.027 --> 01:38:05.509]  And I think that this has really rattled him.
[01:38:06.372 --> 01:38:17.879]  And it has cast a pall over the Democrats, because if I had to guess, 70 to 80% of the people don't want this medical plan, no matter what's in it.
[01:38:18.839 --> 01:38:21.721]  And then you have cap and trade, which is having trouble in the Senate.
[01:38:22.121 --> 01:38:23.662]  You get these terrible ratings.
[01:38:24.262 --> 01:38:30.286]  You get the dollar going down, which is going to affect people, even though they don't know it yet.
[01:38:31.467 --> 01:38:33.608]  And I think also
[01:38:35.435 --> 01:38:38.957]  Besides, not making the shots mandatory.
[01:38:39.877 --> 01:38:44.960]  If we can push them into that corner, then they won't do other things for at least a while.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.943]  Like false flag operations, or a bank holiday, and things like that.
[01:38:50.283 --> 01:39:00.329]  And by the way, they're on record saying they're getting ready under Level 6 WHO pandemic for forced inoculations, lockdowns of cities, but now we have the Governor's Association, and we're going to call
[01:39:01.246 --> 01:39:05.268]  The Governor's Association writing letters saying we don't want federal troops.
[01:39:05.668 --> 01:39:12.031]  The Pentagon's calling for 400,000 now on the streets of America asking for permission from Congress.
[01:39:12.411 --> 01:39:13.872]  Showing men who the real boss is.
[01:39:14.832 --> 01:39:22.116]  We now have Congressman Paul, Congressman Brown, former Congressman Armey saying they may use martial law
[01:39:23.887 --> 01:39:28.690]  The flu generated martial law as a pretext to ram through Obama's agenda.
[01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:30.251]  What have I been saying since April?
[01:39:30.612 --> 01:39:42.000]  That I see that in the fall, them trying to get the cap and trade and the gun grab and the cyber security and all of it, the hate crime, all through in the fall with the flu.
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:46.664]  So even if they don't get forced inoculation, the fear mongering and the hype
[01:39:47.524 --> 01:39:55.992]  Over that, just like anthrax attacks they staged were used to get Patriot Act, I see everything coming down to the wire in October, November, December.
[01:39:56.352 --> 01:40:00.015]  So people better be ready, because Obama is cratering.
[01:40:00.216 --> 01:40:02.397]  He's cratering faster than they thought.
[01:40:03.198 --> 01:40:05.859]  Remember, Biden said they knew he'd crater in the first year.
[01:40:06.539 --> 01:40:07.900]  So, this is it, folks.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:11.001]  This is game, make it or break it time.
[01:40:11.462 --> 01:40:13.562]  This is sudden death over time.
[01:40:13.883 --> 01:40:20.785]  We need everybody, 110%, to get juiced up psychologically and intellectually and go absolutely wild.
[01:40:20.886 --> 01:40:22.326]  We need everybody to go ape right now.
[01:40:22.786 --> 01:40:30.209]  Screaming, yelling, getting the word out, letting the establishment know we see them and we see the terrorists and murderers and criminals they are.
[01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:31.270]  Let's take a call.
[01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:34.512]  Lily in Arizona, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:40:35.353 --> 01:40:38.215]  Hi Alex, hi Bob, it's an honor to be with you on the show.
[01:40:38.555 --> 01:40:53.705]  I have a few points about this flu, the hype, and I grew up in Eastern Europe under communism and coming from that background I can see a lot of things still coming together with what they're trying to do to people.
[01:40:54.586 --> 01:40:58.689]  And just like you said, I've been listening to your show for a while and I realized
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.121]  What a lie they're trying to push on people.
[01:41:03.501 --> 01:41:05.062]  I mean, nothing but lies.
[01:41:05.723 --> 01:41:10.425]  And I don't understand how people cannot see right through the lies.
[01:41:10.965 --> 01:41:15.187]  Because growing up, we grew up not trusting the government.
[01:41:16.368 --> 01:41:17.749]  Your life depended on that.
[01:41:18.769 --> 01:41:23.432]  One out of three people were informants, so you really did not know who you were talking to.
[01:41:24.932 --> 01:41:25.933]  To keep to yourself.
[01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:28.315]  That's what they're trying to do to stifle the First Amendment.
[01:41:28.736 --> 01:41:34.721]  If they succeed in doing that, this country is going down the tubes, and I would hate to see this happen.
[01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:40.887]  And I wonder myself, and I ask myself and my husband, how did America get to this point, and why?
[01:41:41.748 --> 01:41:50.776]  People are taking their liberties for granted, and they're not thinking, one point that I want to make, and I want people to think about it, why would
[01:41:51.363 --> 01:41:58.387]  Kathleen Sebelius, give vaccine makers immunity if there's nothing wrong with those vaccines.
[01:41:58.407 --> 01:41:58.467]  Why?
[01:41:59.568 --> 01:41:59.868]  Why?
[01:42:00.268 --> 01:42:01.609]  People don't ask that question.
[01:42:03.223 --> 01:42:09.466]  Well, and Lily, you know, most people didn't grow up in Eastern Europe under what we're going into.
[01:42:09.546 --> 01:42:10.266]  That's why.
[01:42:10.707 --> 01:42:13.708]  Why did smallpox kill Native Americans but it wouldn't kill the Anglos?
[01:42:14.168 --> 01:42:17.650]  Because the natives had never been exposed to it.
[01:42:17.970 --> 01:42:26.194]  Just like we've never been exposed to real hardcore tyranny, so the average Dumbo doesn't know that because they've never come up against it.
[01:42:26.615 --> 01:42:29.216]  Those of us that haven't lived under tyranny but studied history,
[01:42:29.816 --> 01:42:30.957]  We know what it looks like.
[01:42:31.117 --> 01:42:31.998]  You've lived under it.
[01:42:32.058 --> 01:42:33.059]  You know what it looks like.
[01:42:33.399 --> 01:42:35.441]  Bob fought it when he was fighting the Communists.
[01:42:35.761 --> 01:42:37.302]  He knows what it looks like.
[01:42:38.043 --> 01:42:42.506]  And that's what's so sad about these yuppies that giggle and laugh and think it's all funny.
[01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:47.811]  They don't know that this is hardcore, classical tyranny that's coming down on us.
[01:42:47.871 --> 01:42:49.592]  Bob, and then another comment from Lily.
[01:42:50.132 --> 01:42:51.513]  Bob, comments on what Lily was saying.
[01:42:52.634 --> 01:42:54.116]  Well, I think she's absolutely right.
[01:42:54.176 --> 01:42:55.837]  People haven't experienced it.
[01:42:56.497 --> 01:42:58.259]  And America has never
[01:42:59.183 --> 01:43:02.445]  Collectively, really had a bad day in their life.
[01:43:03.365 --> 01:43:11.770]  I know we've had wars in Vietnam and, you know, for the living, most of the people from World War II are gone.
[01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:18.093]  And we had the war in Korea, and now we've got these actions in the Middle East.
[01:43:18.813 --> 01:43:23.176]  But besides that, most people didn't get involved.
[01:43:24.136 --> 01:43:27.378]  And they don't know what bad is.
[01:43:28.695 --> 01:43:32.642]  I mean, they just go to their job and have their families and so on and so forth.
[01:43:33.162 --> 01:43:35.226]  And they believe the government will fix it.
[01:43:35.426 --> 01:43:37.089]  They believe this propaganda.
[01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:41.135]  And so we have to reach them so they hear the other side of the story.
[01:43:41.436 --> 01:43:41.796]  The truth.
[01:43:41.816 --> 01:43:43.078]  And that's our job.
[01:43:44.055 --> 01:43:57.546]  And what Lilly said is so key, I said it in a long form earlier, but she just like a laser beam said, if they get you to only study yourself, if they get you afraid and chilled to pull in your antennas and not be involved, they win.
[01:43:58.126 --> 01:44:03.470]  The minute, that's why they're out saying, you don't like the president, you don't want to turn your guns in, racist!
[01:44:03.931 --> 01:44:05.172]  You don't like... That's so wrong.
[01:44:05.852 --> 01:44:08.314]  Well that's what the Soviets did, I mean, I mean explain that to people.
[01:44:08.674 --> 01:44:10.716]  We've got to speak up now or it's over.
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:11.620]  Yes.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:19.644]  I remember my grandfather telling me he lived in the 40s and the 50s when the Communist took power.
[01:44:19.904 --> 01:44:24.767]  And he said that they came and took everything from the people and got rid of the ones that were vocal.
[01:44:25.187 --> 01:44:28.608]  The ones that fought against them, put them in jail, killed them.
[01:44:28.648 --> 01:44:29.649]  They disappeared forever.
[01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:30.970]  They took everything.
[01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:36.692]  My grandfather told me they took their animals, the cattle, the plows, everything.
[01:44:36.752 --> 01:44:38.373]  They left them destitute.
[01:44:40.985 --> 01:44:43.187]  People don't hear, don't understand it.
[01:44:43.447 --> 01:44:46.950]  I'm like, I'm looking at people and I said, how can you not see what's coming?
[01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:51.493]  How can you not see how everything is like a puzzle?
[01:44:51.813 --> 01:44:53.735]  They're putting the pieces into place.
[01:44:54.615 --> 01:44:55.616]  The good of everybody.
[01:44:55.676 --> 01:44:58.618]  That was the favorite phrase of the communists.
[01:44:59.019 --> 01:44:59.879]  That's all you heard.
[01:44:59.939 --> 01:45:01.681]  For the good, for the common good.
[01:45:02.521 --> 01:45:03.082]  Who's good?
[01:45:04.651 --> 01:45:08.053]  Well, I want to have you have a minute or so, Lily, on the other side to finish up.
[01:45:08.073 --> 01:45:10.234]  We're going to go to Mark, Jerry, Jeff, Lou, and others.
[01:45:10.254 --> 01:45:11.935]  We're going to hold Bob over a little bit in the next hour.
[01:45:11.955 --> 01:45:14.076]  If he can do it, have him up for a full hour next week.
[01:45:14.436 --> 01:45:20.299]  We had Rand Paul only pop in earlier when Bob is normally on with us, so we apologize to Bob.
[01:45:20.319 --> 01:45:23.441]  But he's so busy, I'm sure he's happy to be on with an abbreviated show.
[01:45:23.461 --> 01:45:23.841]  Stay with us.
[01:45:25.851 --> 01:45:34.673]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:45:34.913 --> 01:45:44.494]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[01:46:20.527 --> 01:46:31.436]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:37.481]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:46:38.021 --> 01:46:44.186]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:46:44.506 --> 01:46:46.327]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:46:46.467 --> 01:46:48.867]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:46:48.927 --> 01:46:59.890]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:47:02.110 --> 01:47:03.411]  It's not about left or right.
[01:47:03.791 --> 01:47:05.191]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:47:05.651 --> 01:47:11.893]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:47:12.558 --> 01:47:20.332]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:47:20.833 --> 01:47:21.975]  The Obama Deception.
[01:47:22.416 --> 01:47:23.598]  The people strike back!
[01:47:25.877 --> 01:47:31.339]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:47:31.379 --> 01:47:31.899]  and the world.
[01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:35.620]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:42.282]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:44.303]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:47:44.543 --> 01:47:52.505]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:47:52.765 --> 01:47:57.208]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:47:57.468 --> 01:48:03.012]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:48:03.293 --> 01:48:05.294]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:48:05.474 --> 01:48:08.837]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.

[01:48:30.092 --> 01:48:30.892]  Gotta call her.
[01:48:30.952 --> 01:48:33.413]  Jeff in South Dakota said he had problems holding up Obama posters.
[01:48:33.453 --> 01:48:35.034]  People come after him.
[01:48:35.074 --> 01:48:36.834]  I'll talk to him in a moment.
[01:48:37.114 --> 01:48:39.935]  I want to talk to Mark and Jerry and Lou and everybody.
[01:48:39.955 --> 01:48:41.836]  We've got this segment and the next.
[01:48:41.856 --> 01:48:49.198]  I want to let Lily in Arizona finish up what she's saying and maybe call in again sometime and tell more stories about Eastern Europe and the Communists.
[01:48:50.119 --> 01:48:52.239]  But I do need to thank the sponsors today.
[01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:53.160]  I haven't gotten to that.
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:49:01.246]  It's my books, my videos, the Obama t-shirts, all the stuff we sell at InfoWars.com is how we fund this operation, and it's not cheap.
[01:49:02.467 --> 01:49:10.614]  Plus, it's great materials we have, so please go and support us at InfoWars.com or call toll free to get the books and videos and t-shirts, 888-253-3139.
[01:49:10.634 --> 01:49:21.904]  We have Come and Take It t-shirts, we have Minuteman t-shirts, the Gadsden flag, Don't Tread on Me t-shirts, InfoWars.com, the shopping cart, check it out.
[01:49:23.191 --> 01:49:26.152]  We also have a lot of great sponsors like New Silver Solution.
[01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:29.713]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of Supernatural Silver.
[01:49:29.793 --> 01:49:30.794]  That's the name of the product.
[01:49:30.874 --> 01:49:32.334]  Super Nano Silver is what it is.
[01:49:32.694 --> 01:49:38.977]  This powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and preventative against infections, germs, and disease.
[01:49:39.417 --> 01:49:42.298]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and is non-toxic.
[01:49:43.188 --> 01:49:45.349]  And it goes on to say that it's great for daily prevention.
[01:49:45.369 --> 01:49:48.550]  We've had a lot of medical doctors on that recommend these Super Nano Silvers.
[01:49:48.930 --> 01:49:50.711]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:49:50.751 --> 01:49:54.753]  Go to their website, find out more about this amazing new technology in colloidal silver.
[01:49:55.093 --> 01:49:56.393]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:49:56.413 --> 01:50:00.355]  They've got a whole line of great products at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:50:00.675 --> 01:50:03.896]  Okay, we've got Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com with us.
[01:50:04.276 --> 01:50:05.277]  And we're going back to Lily.
[01:50:05.317 --> 01:50:06.957]  Lily, anything else you want to add?
[01:50:07.358 --> 01:50:09.478]  You were talking about your grandfather.
[01:50:09.498 --> 01:50:10.419]  You were talking about
[01:50:10.919 --> 01:50:11.920]  Well, that's why I held you over.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:17.864]  About how they always say it's for everyone, it's for the children, it's for the greater good.
[01:50:18.944 --> 01:50:19.925]  Finish up with that thought.
[01:50:20.806 --> 01:50:25.088]  Well, the only good was for the ones, for the dogs at the top.
[01:50:25.929 --> 01:50:29.051]  Because they had everything and everybody else was starving.
[01:50:30.092 --> 01:50:32.974]  That's the good of everyone.
[01:50:33.094 --> 01:50:34.395]  Everyone at the top, that is.
[01:50:34.535 --> 01:50:35.515]  Which is probably, what, 1%? 0.5%?
[01:50:38.703 --> 01:50:57.598]  You know, you never know, but the corruption went on while the whole country was starving and it started with putting fear in people to speak their mind because they arrested those that were vocal in the beginning and it had a chilling effect on everybody and everybody
[01:50:58.258 --> 01:50:59.839]  Well, did you hear the callers?
[01:51:22.486 --> 01:51:33.676]  Well, the particular fellow they're wanting to indict, saying that Obama supporters would run up and take photos and say, I'm reporting you, and that Obama told people, report on your neighbors if they criticize me.
[01:51:34.076 --> 01:51:36.238]  I mean, he really is a very, very wicked person.
[01:51:36.619 --> 01:51:44.686]  People are so stupid, because what they do not understand is that you report someone today,
[01:51:46.133 --> 01:51:50.980]  Your turn is coming back next tomorrow because they're going to turn against you.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:52.662]  There is no loyalty.
[01:51:53.379 --> 01:51:56.381]  So people need to understand that and bend together.
[01:51:56.642 --> 01:52:06.590]  People should work together, not against each other, because the enemy is not the people, and people do not understand that.
[01:52:08.411 --> 01:52:12.274]  And I have a few words of caution for Christians.
[01:52:12.875 --> 01:52:18.179]  Christians better wake up and not wait for the rapture, because that's not going to happen before the trouble.
[01:52:18.806 --> 01:52:23.109]  They better wake up, because the same thing happened in China.
[01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:24.750]  Where were you from in Eastern Europe?
[01:52:25.611 --> 01:52:26.051]  Romania.
[01:52:26.572 --> 01:52:27.332]  Romania, yeah.
[01:52:27.673 --> 01:52:28.333]  Well, God bless you.
[01:52:28.353 --> 01:52:29.194]  Call back in again.
[01:52:29.214 --> 01:52:31.275]  Lily, good to hear from you in Arizona.
[01:52:31.776 --> 01:52:42.284]  Bob, I held her over because I just want people to hear that testimony, but... I mean, did you think you'd ever see an American president saying, rat on your neighbors if they criticize me?
[01:52:44.265 --> 01:52:47.908]  The only place I heard that was in communist countries or
[01:52:48.812 --> 01:52:49.633]  And Nazi Germany.
[01:52:49.673 --> 01:52:54.297]  It's just incredible to see it happening.
[01:52:54.337 --> 01:53:00.382]  And to know these big offshore banks are funding this fake communist system to steal all our wealth.
[01:53:00.702 --> 01:53:01.382]  Bob, stay there.
[01:53:01.443 --> 01:53:04.545]  Back in one minute, we're going to take a few more calls for you.
[01:53:06.967 --> 01:53:08.348]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:53:08.388 --> 01:53:11.051]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:53:15.697 --> 01:53:18.298]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:53:18.698 --> 01:53:23.659]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:53:24.019 --> 01:53:25.759]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:53:26.079 --> 01:53:30.880]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.020]  How much do you want?
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.001]  When do you want it?
[01:53:33.381 --> 01:53:34.981]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:53:35.261 --> 01:53:36.081]  When will you need it?
[01:53:36.341 --> 01:53:38.402]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:53:38.542 --> 01:53:39.642]  Will there be any food?
[01:53:39.882 --> 01:53:40.102]  Will it
[01:53:40.162 --> 01:53:40.482]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:53:59.321 --> 01:54:02.084]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:54:02.364 --> 01:54:04.546]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:54:04.566 --> 01:54:05.567]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:54:05.587 --> 01:54:06.748]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:06.788 --> 01:54:08.609]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:31.941 --> 01:54:32.782]  Okay, real fast.
[01:54:33.002 --> 01:54:35.684]  Mark and Oregon, you're on the air with Bob Shadman.
[01:54:35.724 --> 01:54:36.844]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:54:37.285 --> 01:54:37.485]  Hi.
[01:54:37.505 --> 01:54:39.526]  Go ahead.
[01:54:40.086 --> 01:54:41.027]  Hi, Alex and Bob.
[01:54:41.067 --> 01:54:41.928]  How y'all doing today?
[01:54:41.948 --> 01:54:42.028]  Good.
[01:54:42.848 --> 01:54:50.033]  Um, Alex, a massive poster campaign on the vaccination deception is certainly in order, no doubt.
[01:54:50.754 --> 01:54:51.194]  I don't know.
[01:55:09.497 --> 01:55:09.577]  It's
[01:55:28.584 --> 01:55:28.924]  That's correct.
[01:55:29.044 --> 01:55:30.185]  And also, you have existing groups.
[01:55:50.265 --> 01:55:59.829]  That you would introduce these, you know, posters to and say, look, if you're going to do this, you got to do that, too, because they're going to disagree with the vaccination process.
[01:55:59.889 --> 01:56:06.472]  So you would get a hold of those groups and introduce them to posters and say, put them up everywhere.
[01:56:07.512 --> 01:56:08.753]  And I've done that before.
[01:56:08.773 --> 01:56:14.595]  Of course, I'm a little old for it now, but during political campaigns, you know, we go out and
[01:56:15.277 --> 01:56:20.226]  And from 10 o'clock at night to 6 o'clock in the morning and put posters everywhere!
[01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:27.392]  Yeah, there's nothing more American, nothing more pro-Liberty, and the fact the government's trying to demonize it is outrageous.
[01:56:27.773 --> 01:56:40.798]  San Francisco won first place, the guys that did lower Manhattan, you won second place, and I'm watching all these other videos, I think I know who third place is, I'll announce it on Monday, or during the weekend they'll be posted up on the site.
[01:56:41.078 --> 01:56:45.720]  We're launching a new contest, it'll be up by tonight or tomorrow, to expose the flu.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:47.883]  Okay, to expose the shots.
[01:56:48.324 --> 01:56:50.448]  I've just got to get all that written up and done as well.
[01:56:50.849 --> 01:56:54.517]  Speaking of the posters, let's go to Jeff in South Dakota.
[01:56:54.777 --> 01:56:56.180]  Jeff, quickly, what happened to you?
[01:56:57.754 --> 01:56:59.895]  Yeah, yes Alex and Bob.
[01:56:59.935 --> 01:57:03.296]  I was in Broken Bow, Nebraska, which is where my wife is also a nurse.
[01:57:03.336 --> 01:57:04.797]  I went down to the local gun show.
[01:57:04.817 --> 01:57:12.939]  I was going to take a picture of this huge Obama poster that the local IT slash, you know, all-in-one store guy had up there at the gun show.
[01:57:12.979 --> 01:57:15.600]  The thing must have been 8x10.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:21.342]  In the meantime, I'm putting up my own posters and stuff outside of the Obama Joker poster and stuff.
[01:57:21.963 --> 01:57:25.784]  And as soon as I went back in to do stuff, I noticed my posters and stuff would get ripped down.
[01:57:26.371 --> 01:57:29.835]  I know a couple gentlemen outside, one looked like a farmer, another one looked just like a cowboy.
[01:57:30.396 --> 01:57:31.738]  And it turned out to be the promoters.
[01:57:31.918 --> 01:57:37.845]  They, in the meantime, went inside, made Jim take down his big poster, which I wanted to get for you, Alex, just for being huge.
[01:57:38.005 --> 01:57:39.347]  I mean, nice poster for you.
[01:57:40.188 --> 01:57:41.550]  I came back, I said, well, what was up?
[01:57:41.610 --> 01:57:42.871]  Why are you taking this stuff down?
[01:57:42.931 --> 01:57:45.895]  You're afraid to be political because the, uh...
[01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:50.493]  The mayor of the town here in Brooklyn, Nebraska might kick us out of the municipal building.
[01:57:50.533 --> 01:57:52.894]  And exactly, that's how this tyranny works.
[01:57:53.294 --> 01:58:01.578]  First they tell churches they can't, now they're telling everybody, in fact that's what the local paper in Austin, in Hays County says, we can't allow any of this.
[01:58:01.678 --> 01:58:02.659]  It's un-American.
[01:58:02.959 --> 01:58:06.341]  And soon, that's the point, no one has any free speech.
[01:58:06.701 --> 01:58:09.042]  Bob Chapman, this is exactly what we're talking about.
[01:58:09.962 --> 01:58:10.823]  Absolutely.
[01:58:11.583 --> 01:58:12.424]  Absolutely.
[01:58:12.804 --> 01:58:14.945]  And what you do is you tell a man to take a hike.
[01:58:15.788 --> 01:58:18.570]  No, that's what I was saying.
[01:58:18.650 --> 01:58:23.713]  What really made him mad, I said, well, your ancestors must have been poories or something.
[01:58:24.153 --> 01:58:27.855]  I said, you know, maybe they were fighting on the wrong side of the revolution.
[01:58:27.875 --> 01:58:29.136]  And they started getting in my face.
[01:58:29.216 --> 01:58:30.777]  Obviously, my hands are full of stuff.
[01:58:31.257 --> 01:58:34.339]  They just literally pushed and shoved me out the door.
[01:58:34.359 --> 01:58:37.801]  You know, these are supposed to be supposed right-wing conservative people.
[01:58:37.821 --> 01:58:38.682]  I said, well, you know better.
[01:58:39.497 --> 01:58:42.318]  Shut me down than Obama or Clinton or Bush was.
[01:58:42.338 --> 01:58:42.699]  No, they are.
[01:58:42.719 --> 01:58:43.519]  They're cowards.
[01:58:43.879 --> 01:58:46.100]  They literally worship licking boots.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.521]  And we better not let anybody put posters up.
[01:58:49.042 --> 01:58:51.103]  They might come get us in America, you know.
[01:58:52.063 --> 01:58:54.424]  I mean, they might as well live in Romania in 1965.
[01:58:54.664 --> 01:58:58.226]  They might as well live in Ukraine in 1935.
[01:58:58.726 --> 01:59:01.047]  I mean, these people want to be raped.
[01:59:01.308 --> 01:59:02.328]  They want to be enslaved.
[01:59:02.388 --> 01:59:03.108]  It's disgusting.
[01:59:03.429 --> 01:59:04.149]  Keep it up, Jeff.
[01:59:04.169 --> 01:59:05.570]  Get the posters out all over the town.
[01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:06.390]  Don't stop.
[01:59:06.710 --> 01:59:07.371]  Bob Chapman.
[01:59:07.431 --> 01:59:09.312]  His forecast comes out twice a week.
[01:59:09.332 --> 01:59:12.014]  Get a free copy at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:59:12.054 --> 01:59:13.135]  See you next week, my friend!
[01:59:14.085 --> 01:59:14.845]  Okay, bye-bye.
[01:59:15.345 --> 01:59:15.686]  Take care.
[01:59:15.726 --> 01:59:16.226]  There he goes.
[01:59:16.246 --> 01:59:22.768]  We'll be right back with a special guest, the medical doctor who came out and said this health care plan is eugenics.
[01:59:23.188 --> 01:59:24.209]  He resigned from the AMA.
[01:59:24.929 --> 01:59:28.910]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:59:29.150 --> 01:59:30.951]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:39.414]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:39.674 --> 01:59:44.900]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:45.221 --> 01:59:46.843]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:47.083 --> 01:59:53.430]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:53.610 --> 01:59:58.136]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[01:59:58.376 --> 01:59:58.776]  That's right.
[02:00:24.764 --> 02:00:29.931]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:00:30.071 --> 02:00:32.014]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:00:32.154 --> 02:00:34.437]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:00:34.597 --> 02:00:36.460]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.242]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:00:38.502 --> 02:00:39.544]  There is a solution.
[02:00:39.764 --> 02:00:47.790]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:55.255]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:01:01.699 --> 02:01:07.263]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:01:07.683 --> 02:01:11.508]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:01:25.245 --> 02:01:28.186]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:01:28.347 --> 02:01:33.589]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:01:33.869 --> 02:01:39.232]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:40.692]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:01:41.053 --> 02:01:49.957]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[02:01:50.377 --> 02:01:52.019]  Now, compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:01:52.219 --> 02:01:56.383]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:01:56.423 --> 02:02:01.047]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:02:01.448 --> 02:02:03.530]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:02:05.291 --> 02:02:06.052]  Keep it natural.
[02:02:06.072 --> 02:02:14.383]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[02:02:14.763 --> 02:02:18.868]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[02:02:18.888 --> 02:02:20.250]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:02:27.199 --> 02:02:30.001]  He's done some research, and when you start rash, it happened.
[02:02:30.021 --> 02:02:41.711]  I mean, if you got 50 million more people in the system, and a certain number of doctors, people are going to be in line, and you're going to have to determine who gets the next treatment, is unfairly, the elderly are the ones who are going to get shortchanged.
[02:02:41.951 --> 02:02:42.631]  That's so true.
[02:02:42.711 --> 02:02:44.333]  I mean, in a way, it's a form of eugenics.
[02:02:48.601 --> 02:02:50.202]  And that's why we've got him on with us.
[02:02:50.442 --> 02:02:56.025]  I continually hear him point out how they want to put troops on the streets, have the inoculations, martial law.
[02:02:56.365 --> 02:02:57.866]  Now Ron Paul is talking about it.
[02:02:57.946 --> 02:03:05.850]  Former Congressman Dick Armey saying they may use this as a pretext to get their health care ram through this flu hype that they've got going.
[02:03:06.250 --> 02:03:14.215]  So joining us for one segment, and then we've got Congressman Ron Paul coming up, is of course Dr. Mark Siegel, Fox News contributor.
[02:03:15.216 --> 02:03:23.550]  And I certainly agree with a lot of the information he covers and also meshes with some of the other medical doctors and virologists and epidemiologists that we have on.
[02:03:23.911 --> 02:03:25.213]  Sir, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:03:25.494 --> 02:03:26.215]  Good to see you.
[02:03:26.515 --> 02:03:27.056]  How you doing?
[02:03:27.096 --> 02:03:27.778]  Nice to be on.
[02:03:28.157 --> 02:03:28.657]  Good, good.
[02:03:29.178 --> 02:03:31.379]  Give us your take on Obamacare.
[02:03:31.399 --> 02:03:32.720]  I mean, I've gone over the sections.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:38.904]  All that bad stuff is in there, or it points at boards that we know do carry out all this rationing.
[02:03:39.164 --> 02:03:41.346]  We know what happens in Canada and England and Germany.
[02:03:41.686 --> 02:03:42.487]  That's on record.
[02:03:42.507 --> 02:03:45.488]  You can watch the House of Commons on C-SPAN and see them admitting it.
[02:03:46.209 --> 02:03:53.434]  I mean, as a doctor, give us your snapshot of this program, where you see it going, and why you're saying it borders on eugenics.
[02:03:54.141 --> 02:03:58.282]  Well, I think that the big issue here is that it starts in the wrong place.
[02:03:58.702 --> 02:04:07.884]  I'm getting more and more disturbed about it now that we're seeing these religious references and everyone that doesn't agree with President Obama is somehow bearing false witness.
[02:04:07.944 --> 02:04:09.325]  I mean, how awful is that?
[02:04:09.405 --> 02:04:14.686]  I think that the whole discussion is misguided.
[02:04:16.155 --> 02:04:21.338]  Anybody understands in the United States that if we're going to change something, we need a debate.
[02:04:21.418 --> 02:04:27.781]  So it's very suspicious that if you disagree with the president and the administration, somehow you're wrong.
[02:04:27.801 --> 02:04:29.342]  I mean, where's the debate then?
[02:04:29.402 --> 02:04:30.823]  There's got to be something to discuss.
[02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:35.025]  And what about practicing physicians who are in the trenches every day with patients?
[02:04:35.345 --> 02:04:35.805]  We're good.
[02:04:55.461 --> 02:04:58.684]  Well, they're admitting, doctor, they can't even read the 1,300-page bill.
[02:04:59.305 --> 02:05:00.326]  Conyers admits that.
[02:05:00.346 --> 02:05:08.554]  I mean, how can they implement something if they can't even read what was written by special interest A, and then B, going back and backing you up?
[02:05:09.035 --> 02:05:16.262]  We have them all over the news now as a mantra saying, you can't even call it socialism, or you're a racist, using the N-word.
[02:05:17.423 --> 02:05:22.785]  Weaponizing politics, terrorizing the public, and invoking racism.
[02:05:22.825 --> 02:05:24.366]  They're actually the ones using race.
[02:05:24.666 --> 02:05:26.507]  They're the ones that are engaging in racism.
[02:05:26.807 --> 02:05:27.607]  Race pimping!
[02:05:28.447 --> 02:05:33.649]  Well, I mean, you know, really, I think that we have to get back to basics here.
[02:05:33.729 --> 02:05:34.730]  You know, what are the basics?
[02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:37.271]  The basics are, whether they like it or not,
[02:05:38.058 --> 02:05:41.159]  Healthcare and health insurance are not the same thing.
[02:05:41.419 --> 02:05:42.539]  Americans understand that.
[02:05:42.599 --> 02:05:44.980]  That's one of the reasons we're having the problem we're having.
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.560]  Americans understand that.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:52.342]  They own an automobile, and they know if they bring their automobile in with a scratch, their rates are going to go up.
[02:05:52.842 --> 02:05:59.464]  And if they try to bring their automobile in with a scratch too much, they're going to find out there are no repair shops around taking their insurance.
[02:05:59.904 --> 02:06:02.987]  That's something we've lost sight of with health insurance.
[02:06:03.227 --> 02:06:05.729]  Health insurance is the problem, it's not the solution.
[02:06:06.029 --> 02:06:08.851]  And government-run health insurance is absolutely the worst.
[02:06:08.931 --> 02:06:13.935]  So it's completely disingenuous to have this discussion without looking at what real
[02:06:14.739 --> 02:06:16.320]  Health needs, healthcare needs are.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.402]  And one thing is, and this is where I get very upset, there's a great shortage of physicians in the United States.
[02:06:21.682 --> 02:06:33.626]  There's an estimated 40,000 primary care physicians we're going to be lacking in the next 10 years, and you can probably triple that given the fact that we have 78 million baby boomers coming in.
[02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:35.767]  Then let's piss off physicians more?
[02:06:36.067 --> 02:06:36.847]  Let's cut them?
[02:06:36.907 --> 02:06:37.628]  Oh, don't worry!
[02:06:37.828 --> 02:06:39.548]  We're not cutting benefits to patients.
[02:06:39.768 --> 02:06:41.069]  We're only cutting benefits
[02:06:41.329 --> 02:06:41.770]  We're good.
[02:06:52.887 --> 02:06:59.691]  And he can't even afford, and he can't even, I mean my dad's a physician, he can't even then afford the medical malpractice insurance.
[02:06:59.971 --> 02:07:04.274]  People aren't living in the real world that don't live and work as a physician like you do.
[02:07:04.314 --> 02:07:06.556]  And I think you point out the whole debates of fraud.
[02:07:06.916 --> 02:07:11.279]  Back before we had medical insurance, we even had, you know, better access to health care.
[02:07:11.299 --> 02:07:13.340]  It becomes just this bigger and bigger
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:21.162]  Fraud, this bigger and bigger scam where the expenses of the bureaucracies go up and the media is saying it's the doctors getting the money.
[02:07:21.542 --> 02:07:22.563]  I see the statistics.
[02:07:22.863 --> 02:07:26.584]  Doctors in the last 20 years, in many cases, are making half of what they were.
[02:07:26.604 --> 02:07:29.064]  You know, people ask me all the time, why aren't doctors fighting?
[02:07:29.104 --> 02:07:30.465]  I'll give you a couple of answers for that.
[02:07:30.665 --> 02:07:33.826]  Number one, you're not going to believe, which is they're too busy taking care of patients.
[02:07:34.306 --> 02:07:41.848]  Number two is most doctors realize that they're being steamrolled and they don't feel that there's anything to do about it, so why waste their time?
[02:07:42.208 --> 02:07:46.471]  But there's going to be a rude awakening in a few years if this gets slammed down.
[02:07:46.772 --> 02:07:47.993]  Doctors are going to revolt.
[02:07:48.313 --> 02:07:51.996]  And I'll have to tell you, full disclosure, here's how doctors revolt.
[02:07:52.336 --> 02:07:55.539]  They either drop out or they game the system.
[02:07:55.759 --> 02:07:57.060]  Now, do patients want that?
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.401]  Do you want to be gamed?
[02:07:58.421 --> 02:08:00.182]  Do you want your doctor to drop out?
[02:08:00.543 --> 02:08:06.487]  Let's deal with a real myth, that you're going to get to keep the doctor you've got now until he quits!
[02:08:07.008 --> 02:08:07.328]  You know?
[02:08:07.488 --> 02:08:09.450]  Great, great, great quote.
[02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:10.931]  Get to keep the doctor you have now.
[02:08:11.431 --> 02:08:15.212]  So, you know, physicians are being completely ignored in this whole discussion.
[02:08:15.693 --> 02:08:17.533]  And a few of us have loud voices.
[02:08:18.013 --> 02:08:27.797]  But clearly, the debate... Would you have a debate about who's operating your train without talking about the conductor?
[02:08:27.997 --> 02:08:31.258]  Would you say, let's pad the seats, let's get new dining cars?
[02:08:31.318 --> 02:08:32.919]  By the way, the engineer's quitting.
[02:08:33.319 --> 02:08:34.339]  He's driving the train!
[02:08:34.439 --> 02:08:43.081]  Well, that's like the government says they're going to put screen doors on submarines without consulting the engineer who designed the submarine.
[02:08:43.701 --> 02:08:45.341]  I mean, it's totally the case.
[02:08:45.401 --> 02:08:50.643]  And I don't want your listeners to think, by the way, that I only care about doctors, but there's a trickle-down effect here.
[02:08:51.003 --> 02:08:56.144]  Because everybody knows that when you go to the doctor's office, you're not meeting President Obama, you're meeting your physician.
[02:08:56.564 --> 02:09:02.545]  And by the way, one more thing that I don't think I've ever said before, I want to make a really important point here.
[02:09:03.396 --> 02:09:10.379]  You know, doctors are not the same doctors that we were dealing with in 1964 when Medicare came down the pike.
[02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:15.321]  Those doctors were definitely living high on the hog, and there was a lot of fat on the bone.
[02:09:15.341 --> 02:09:19.103]  Now, I don't happen to think the fat was chipped off the bone in the right way.
[02:09:19.183 --> 02:09:26.486]  I don't think HMOs work very well, and I know that the government insurance does it, but the doctors we have now are very close to the bone.
[02:09:26.526 --> 02:09:28.607]  They have very, very high overhead.
[02:09:28.667 --> 02:09:29.807]  They're working their butts off.
[02:09:29.847 --> 02:09:31.288]  They're seeing 40 patients a day.
[02:09:32.448 --> 02:09:38.833]  I mean, let's flood their offices with millions of more patients and pay them less, and hospitals we're going to cut?
[02:09:39.274 --> 02:09:40.695]  Well, I've seen it with nurses.
[02:09:40.755 --> 02:09:42.136]  That's why they've got such a shortage there.
[02:09:42.156 --> 02:09:49.462]  I mean, it's a hellish job, because they are overworking everybody, and they use a few specialists on TV to demonize the profession.
[02:09:49.702 --> 02:09:51.743]  In the five minutes we've got left, I want to plug your website.
[02:09:51.763 --> 02:09:53.144]  It's drsiegel.com.
[02:09:53.164 --> 02:09:54.345]  That's drsiegel.com.
[02:09:54.606 --> 02:09:56.567]  I wanted to specifically get into eugenics, though.
[02:09:56.587 --> 02:09:58.509]  You said it's almost like eugenics.
[02:09:58.529 --> 02:09:59.930]  Well, the bioethicist boards
[02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:00.770]  Because we're
[02:10:21.243 --> 02:10:24.105]  Not to make any difference between one patient and another.
[02:10:24.165 --> 02:10:26.766]  I've talked about that endlessly and thought about that.
[02:10:27.106 --> 02:10:33.610]  I don't treat overweight people differently than skinny people, except that I might focus on being overweight as a problem.
[02:10:33.970 --> 02:10:37.112]  I don't say, this patient has no money, I'm going to treat them less.
[02:10:37.752 --> 02:10:40.274]  I don't say this person's rich, I'm going to treat them better.
[02:10:40.675 --> 02:10:42.676]  My patients wouldn't have it any other way.
[02:10:42.696 --> 02:10:49.982]  So where's the government coming along saying, you know, things like Ezekiel Emanuel has written about life years?
[02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:51.003]  Too many life years?
[02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:53.145]  I mean, what is that all about?
[02:10:53.305 --> 02:10:56.047]  Why don't elderly deserve the same care as young people?
[02:10:56.407 --> 02:10:58.669]  A patient is a patient is a patient.
[02:10:59.009 --> 02:11:04.814]  That's the only way doctors can practice, and it's the only way healthcare can be delivered, and it's what the United States wants.
[02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:17.717]  And they're phrasing it in the media and the government like it's good, like you want the government taking tests away, you want the government giving you an aspirin for a heart attack, like Cuba.
[02:11:17.757 --> 02:11:18.557]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:11:19.548 --> 02:11:23.790]  I think the biggest issue with the government, by the way, is that they don't have the qualifications.
[02:11:24.650 --> 02:11:31.453]  Never mind that they do such a great job with the IRS and with the Post Office, but they're just learning their talking points now.
[02:11:31.553 --> 02:11:34.594]  They're going to seminars and tutorials on healthcare.
[02:11:35.975 --> 02:11:38.116]  That's the thing that's most disturbing here of all.
[02:11:40.217 --> 02:11:46.080]  I watch politics with a jaundiced eye to begin with, but where do these guys get off thinking they can be healthcare experts?
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:49.542]  That's the biggest bearing of false witness here to begin with.
[02:11:49.882 --> 02:11:52.204]  I mean, where did this guy get an MD from?
[02:11:54.625 --> 02:11:58.167]  I've been in this for two decades already, and I'm not just a practicing physician.
[02:11:58.487 --> 02:11:59.688]  As you know, I'm writing about this.
[02:11:59.728 --> 02:12:01.729]  I've been writing about health policy for ten years.
[02:12:02.029 --> 02:12:03.550]  I've studied this very carefully.
[02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:05.511]  There's too many people in this
[02:12:06.297 --> 02:12:11.719]  Dealing with this, ramming this down our throats, who are not qualified to be looking at health care and health reform.
[02:12:12.039 --> 02:12:19.283]  But they are qualified to steal 20% of the country's economy that's not under government control, so they can give it to their fat cat buddies is now coming out.
[02:12:19.643 --> 02:12:20.803]  In closing, the flu.
[02:12:21.384 --> 02:12:22.644]  I've seen no U.S.
[02:12:22.704 --> 02:12:23.164]  media.
[02:12:23.624 --> 02:12:25.605]  I'd love for you to break this nationally.
[02:12:25.625 --> 02:12:26.826]  You've got the power to do it.
[02:12:27.226 --> 02:12:33.769]  The Sunday Mail, the London Telegraph, German News Reports, Swine Flu, Jablink, the killer nerve disease,
[02:12:34.389 --> 02:12:49.781]  Leaked letter reveals concern of neurologists over 25 deaths in America in the test alone of the vaccine by Gillian Bernays and other deaths of neurological, it's switching on some autoimmune response, massive brain swelling.
[02:12:50.081 --> 02:12:55.025]  Doctor, your comments on this and the news saying three shots could mutate in the body.
[02:12:56.873 --> 02:12:58.615]  Look, I think it's a mild virus.
[02:12:58.835 --> 02:13:02.758]  I think that, as you hinted before I came on, we don't know how it's going to be hyped yet.
[02:13:02.858 --> 02:13:04.800]  We don't know what the administration's going to do to hype it.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:10.545]  I think it's a mild virus, but I do think it's made its way around the world, and I think we have to pay particular attention to it.
[02:13:10.645 --> 02:13:13.848]  I don't think we can ignore it, but the hysteria is totally ridiculous.
[02:13:14.208 --> 02:13:28.118]  I think we need a vaccine to it, but the vaccine that is problematic, because in 1976, we had what we thought was a swine flu epidemic, which was completely fabricated, it turned out, and we ended up with close to a thousand cases of ascending paralysis as a result.
[02:13:28.619 --> 02:13:33.902]  That could happen again, but I don't want to use fear of the vaccine to replace fear of the virus.
[02:13:33.962 --> 02:13:35.083]  I don't like fear in general.
[02:13:35.103 --> 02:13:36.044]  I've written books on this.
[02:13:36.852 --> 02:13:38.254]  But doctor, we got 30 seconds.
[02:13:38.655 --> 02:13:45.566]  My issue here is that internal CDC, they're saying, Keith, I mean, were you aware of this?
[02:13:45.606 --> 02:13:46.447]  It's not in our news.
[02:13:46.568 --> 02:13:47.128]  I'm aware of it.
[02:13:48.263 --> 02:13:48.803]  You are aware?
[02:13:49.204 --> 02:13:54.206]  I'm aware of it, but I don't know the extent to which it's a problem versus 76.
[02:13:54.347 --> 02:13:58.889]  In other words, it remains to be seen how significant a side effect this is.
[02:13:59.349 --> 02:14:04.372]  Before I go and tell people, be afraid of this vaccine, I want to see more about what a risk this really is.
[02:14:04.552 --> 02:14:08.215]  Exactly, but they're keeping it secret, so shouldn't that be public?
[02:14:08.235 --> 02:14:09.595]  Shouldn't there be a big debate about this?
[02:14:09.715 --> 02:14:15.759]  There should be a big debate about this, but I'm telling you right now, I'm always on the side of the facts, and I want to close by saying I think the vaccine is
[02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:18.503]  DrSegal.com.
[02:14:18.523 --> 02:14:19.984]  Doc, thanks for talking to us.
[02:14:20.004 --> 02:14:20.704]  Oh, my pleasure.
[02:14:20.724 --> 02:14:21.125]  Anytime.
[02:14:21.425 --> 02:14:21.825]  You bet.
[02:14:23.486 --> 02:14:27.489]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:14:27.769 --> 02:14:30.611]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:14:31.031 --> 02:14:38.836]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we, the people,
[02:14:39.076 --> 02:14:41.017]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[02:14:41.317 --> 02:14:43.277]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:14:43.697 --> 02:14:50.139]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:14:50.499 --> 02:14:56.301]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:14:56.701 --> 02:14:57.821]  Please stand with Utopia
[02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:58.101]  I think so.
[02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:26.632]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:15:26.872 --> 02:15:30.454]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:15:30.694 --> 02:15:39.558]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[02:15:39.879 --> 02:15:43.821]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.
[02:15:44.101 --> 02:15:48.323]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas Report, Midas Resources will pay you.

[02:15:59.886 --> 02:16:01.387]  So, what are you waiting for?

[02:16:05.588 --> 02:16:07.448]  That's 888-292-2709.
[02:16:07.769 --> 02:16:15.991]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:29.056]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:16:29.756 --> 02:16:35.103]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:16:35.643 --> 02:16:41.811]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:16:42.131 --> 02:16:43.952]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:16:44.092 --> 02:16:46.474]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:16:46.554 --> 02:16:57.502]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:16:59.743 --> 02:17:01.044]  It's not about left or right.
[02:17:01.424 --> 02:17:02.825]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:17:03.286 --> 02:17:09.530]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:26.118]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:17:26.538 --> 02:17:31.502]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:17:31.862 --> 02:17:33.603]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:17:33.924 --> 02:17:38.507]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:17:38.507 --> 02:17:38.987]  I don't know.
[02:17:57.056 --> 02:17:57.356]  We're good!
[02:18:30.277 --> 02:18:34.422]  Folks, I'm gonna be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:18:34.522 --> 02:18:35.703]  here in this very studio.
[02:18:36.244 --> 02:18:37.805]  Also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:37.825 --> 02:18:42.390]  I want to thank all the members that have made the show possible.
[02:18:43.852 --> 02:18:51.901]  I mean, how could that last doctor, who's a nice guy and it speaks out more than most against the system, calling it eugenics, say, yeah, I know it's killing some people.
[02:18:53.732 --> 02:18:59.958]  But, you know, we've got to see if this is, I forget his exact quote, you know, an acceptable level of side effects.
[02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:01.960]  Because, you know, that's what they do, they triage.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:08.325]  They say, well, if this vaccine saves 10,000 people, but it kills 1,000, you know, it's okay.
[02:19:08.386 --> 02:19:09.607]  That's kind of the medical idea.
[02:19:09.627 --> 02:19:13.951]  I'm not saying Siegel's saying that, but it's in the same general idea and area.
[02:19:15.089 --> 02:19:17.451]  They know it doesn't protect you from the flu.
[02:19:17.791 --> 02:19:19.312]  They know it's already mutated.
[02:19:19.993 --> 02:19:21.995]  You know their history of adding stuff to it.
[02:19:22.295 --> 02:19:29.000]  You've got to admit what this medical system's doing, hyping this flu that's killed almost nobody up like it's the end of the world.
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:30.281]  This is a big deal.
[02:19:30.341 --> 02:19:32.843]  We're going to expose it with the contest.
[02:19:33.243 --> 02:19:42.130]  Ron Paul is coming up and then the rebroadcast starts and I'll be back next, well this Sunday, live.
[02:19:42.611 --> 02:19:43.632]  I want to thank the crew.
[02:19:45.121 --> 02:19:53.908]  In fact, guys, make sure I also... I'm supposed to, during the break, call that other TV reporter, so... And when Duke gets back, make sure... I'm having to give orders right now because I've got a bunch of stuff coming up.
[02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:57.491]  My mind starts racing with all the different things we do.
[02:19:57.771 --> 02:20:08.440]  Make sure we go ahead and give the Fox News reporter that young man's phone number that put the posters up so they can get the facts straight in the Fox News story.
[02:20:09.881 --> 02:20:11.622]  So, that's happening too.
[02:20:12.924 --> 02:20:23.210]  I wanted to thank a few of the sponsors that I haven't really gotten to today before we go into this Ron Paul interview that's coming up, because it is the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:28.393]  MySolarBackup.com, a lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, and ice storms.
[02:20:28.793 --> 02:20:31.515]  Literature should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[02:20:31.915 --> 02:20:36.858]  A solar-powered generator is now available from our good and wonderful longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[02:20:37.339 --> 02:20:39.160]  The website's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:40.500]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:20:41.621 --> 02:20:48.004]  They have the PowerSource 1800 watt generator and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:20:48.044 --> 02:20:54.987]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:20:55.367 --> 02:20:58.029]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:20:58.589 --> 02:21:01.570]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:03.291]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:21:09.657 --> 02:21:16.514]  And lastly, before I had a few other little pieces of news here and go to the Ron Paul interview, I want to thank the great folks at Front Sight.
[02:21:16.795 --> 02:21:18.920]  This is the premier national
[02:21:20.367 --> 02:21:26.171]  Shooting Training Center that's got four and five day courses, no drill instructor attitude, great for the whole family.
[02:21:26.191 --> 02:21:44.623]  They have a lot of free stuff online as well, a great free newsletter, FrontSight.com, and they're giving a free XD pistol in the caliber of your choice when you sign up for the five-day world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, and also get the 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:21:44.643 --> 02:21:46.584]  So the website's FrontSight.com.
[02:21:46.864 --> 02:21:49.806]  Take advantage of that today at Front Sight.
[02:21:50.226 --> 02:21:55.030]  I didn't plug really any sponsors until late last hour.
[02:21:55.051 --> 02:21:58.814]  I wanted to get those in and thank them because they make the show possible.
[02:21:59.294 --> 02:22:04.999]  And I also want to thank everybody out there that is making copies of my films and getting them out to people.
[02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:12.566]  Everybody out there that's spreading the word about the radio show, the free podcast, that you can go to the listen page at the top of InfoWars.com.
[02:22:14.363 --> 02:22:15.584]  Yeah, there's the Fox News story.
[02:22:15.944 --> 02:22:19.747]  Felony vandalism charges possible in Obama-Joker poster case.
[02:22:20.047 --> 02:22:22.169]  We have Joshua Miller's number from Fox.
[02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:23.690]  He's been calling us.
[02:22:23.710 --> 02:22:25.992]  We need to call him and explain this is all fraud.
[02:22:26.392 --> 02:22:30.075]  And the police told the young man that we know this is selective enforcement.
[02:22:32.648 --> 02:22:36.930]  That they don't normally go after people from this, but it's political pressure.
[02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:42.612]  And that Obama supporters were there snapping photos of people doing it and saying, we're going to turn you in.
[02:22:42.972 --> 02:22:46.113]  Just like Obama told them to do on his own website.
[02:22:46.453 --> 02:22:49.354]  So, again, this is a big, big issue.
[02:22:49.374 --> 02:22:53.636]  We'll have more for you on the abbreviated Sunday Show as well.
[02:22:55.114 --> 02:22:57.340]  In other news, the dollar is plunging.
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:01.911]  All the real economic numbers show commodities exploding because of dollar devaluation.
[02:23:01.951 --> 02:23:03.695]  Takes more dollars worldwide to buy those.
[02:23:05.353 --> 02:23:08.195]  Governments are moving away from the dollar.
[02:23:08.935 --> 02:23:10.256]  Unemployment skyrocketing.
[02:23:10.356 --> 02:23:12.517]  Every real economic indicator is we're dead meat.
[02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:19.300]  Meanwhile, the media is telling you the economy's great because it is for the big bankers and the billionaires and the people that control trillions.
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:22.842]  This is their big consolidation, their vertical integration.
[02:23:23.122 --> 02:23:28.485]  Because we're armed, they can't come in with a Soviet takeover right away, so they can economically rape us.
[02:23:29.065 --> 02:23:32.326]  And Obama's their front man to take the blame of that, just like Bush was involved.
[02:23:32.647 --> 02:23:46.612]  We have got to expose the offshore banks for stealing $23.7 trillion in the last 10 months, hoarding that money, and paying banks not to loan to the citizens to kill the economy so the banks can force a consolidation.
[02:23:46.852 --> 02:23:48.393]  They want a destroyed economy.
[02:23:48.653 --> 02:23:52.375]  Not your local bank, the big, multinational king banks.
[02:23:52.975 --> 02:23:57.177]  Want to destroy the economy so they can consolidate it and vertically integrate it.
[02:23:57.417 --> 02:24:00.238]  Want to say great job to the crew here as well.
[02:24:00.258 --> 02:24:07.001]  Before I run out of time with this interview with Ron Paul, don't know if we'll have time for that coming up and all the sponsors and affiliates.
[02:24:07.041 --> 02:24:09.522]  Be sure and support our local sponsors as well.
[02:24:10.062 --> 02:24:10.742]  We'll be right back.
[02:24:12.983 --> 02:24:13.884]  We're on the march.
[02:24:14.364 --> 02:24:15.984]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:24:16.905 --> 02:24:19.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:22.691 --> 02:24:27.695]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:24:27.895 --> 02:24:31.718]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:24:31.918 --> 02:24:37.543]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:24:37.843 --> 02:24:42.687]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:24:42.887 --> 02:24:43.408]  Number 3.
[02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:49.254]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:24:49.435 --> 02:24:49.935]  Number 4.
[02:24:50.115 --> 02:24:52.758]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:24:53.019 --> 02:24:56.442]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:24:56.683 --> 02:24:56.883]  Number 5.
[02:24:57.524 --> 02:25:01.148]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:25:01.368 --> 02:25:06.870]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:25:25.733 --> 02:25:26.374]  Well, you should.
[02:25:26.714 --> 02:25:30.959]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:31.700]  That's right.
[02:25:32.021 --> 02:25:39.770]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapon.
