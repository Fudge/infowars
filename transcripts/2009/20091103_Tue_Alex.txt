[00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:06.008]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:07.789]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:09.530]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.131]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:12.012]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:16.875]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:27.561]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.143]  Well, another very important radio broadcast.
[00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:55.610]  The Senate has passed the global government taxing regulation system, the enslavement system, out of committee.
[00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.133]  It's been marked up to, in the near future, go for a full vote in the Senate.
[00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.675]  We're finally getting details of the Senate version.
[00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:06.076]  It's just as bad as the House version.
[00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:09.158]  It needs to be very similar so that
[00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:15.175]  They can complete its passage.
[00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:33.681]  And Merkel, the German Chancellor, just completed 30 minutes ago or so, a speech before Congress pushing the global tax and propagandizing everyone how it's this great humanitarian effort.
[00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:38.062]  Meanwhile, the New York Times admits today, but puts their spin on it like it's a good thing.
[00:01:39.485 --> 00:02:04.876]  Now, two years ago, when we talked about how Al Gore created the Climate Change Exchange and owns it, and how his firm and other firms connected to the current administration are set to make billions of dollars a year off of controlling who's allowed to do business, and buying and selling and auctioning carbon credits.
[00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:05.997]  That's just one part of the scam.
[00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:10.689]  We would be called conspiracy theorists.
[00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.411]  Didn't matter if we had all the documents and it was admitted.
[00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.953]  Now it's all over the news, but they're putting a spin on it.
[00:02:15.953 --> 00:02:16.694]  Isn't it good?
[00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:18.855]  Wasn't it smart of Al Gore?
[00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:24.520]  He's going to make all these billions of dollars buying and selling carbon credits and setting up the taxing system.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.180]  Isn't it good?
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.621]  Isn't it cute?
[00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:28.102]  Isn't it sweet?
[00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:30.744]  Aren't we lucky to have this inventor of the internet?
[00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:35.828]  This man who honchoed, who hatcheted through NAFTA and GATT.
[00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:36.789]  Hadn't that been great for us?
[00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:40.867]  Oh, aren't we lucky to have Al Gore.
[00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:45.389]  Al Gore set to become first carbon billionaire is the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:52.794]  CO2 tax agenda front man lining his pockets on the back of the global warming fear-mongering.
[00:02:52.794 --> 00:03:01.419]  This is a guy telling us that when there's weather changes, it's man-made and that the Earth's going to flood and our major coastal cities are going to be destroyed.
[00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.040]  But don't worry, he's the savior of the world.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.942]  You can buy indulgences from him and go to heaven.
[00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:18.098]  Like the Catholic Church 600 years ago saying, you've got to buy these indulgences from us or your family members that have died will go to hell.
[00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:29.927]  They're in purgatory and if you don't give more money in taxes to the Vatican, your family will be sent out of purgatory to hell!
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.463]  This is the exact same thing.
[00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:44.020]  If you don't pay all your money and let bureaucrats run your life and pay all these hundreds of taxes to private central banks and let them rule your life, you will drown!
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.042]  You will die!
[00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:46.244]  Polar bears will drown!
[00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.483]  Every time there's a fire or an earthquake, they say it's climate change.
[00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:57.027]  I mean, these people... This is what witch doctors 10,000 years ago would do.
[00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:03.616]  They'd say, give me the best hut, give me the best women, give me the best food, or the snake god will eat the sun.
[00:04:04.898 --> 00:04:08.260]  And they knew when there were going to be eclipses of the moon and sun.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.684]  And people would ignore him sometimes, but then he'd get up and go, ooga booga, jumba boomba, hobba gobba, blomba bobba.
[00:04:14.684 --> 00:04:15.905]  Ooga ooga ooga!
[00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:22.789]  And then he would wave his arms and throw some pixie dust into the fire, some gunpowder, and it would explode, and everybody would get scared.
[00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:30.194]  And then he'd go, uh-uh, and shake, and everyone would get scared, and then the snake god
[00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:42.981]  Or the Goblin God, or the Titan, would eat the sun, and then everybody would prostrate themselves before him, begging them, and then he'd wave his arms again, and the Serpent God would spit the sun out.
[00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.123]  And for another 30, 40 years, they wouldn't question the priest class.
[00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:50.345]  And the priest class said, the sun won't come back unless you sacrifice your kids to me.
[00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:55.368]  I want you to cut their beating hearts out of their chest, or the Sun God will die.
[00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:58.810]  It's the same crap today, and it's a big, sick joke, and the public loves it.
[00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.651]  They love being scammed.
[00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:03.492]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.492 --> 00:05:08.819]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.881]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:15.887]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.887 --> 00:05:16.788]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.048 --> 00:05:18.169]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.050]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.130]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.331]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:24.672]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:26.193]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:31.476]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:35.058]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:38.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.081]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:41.001]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:42.101]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:43.022]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.022 --> 00:05:44.122]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:47.163]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:48.944]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:48.944 --> 00:05:49.864]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:05.656]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:08.899]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:10.320]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:14.448]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:20.089]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:25.451]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:35.253]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.373 --> 00:06:37.714]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:39.315]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.776]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.897]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:43.897 --> 00:06:49.040]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:58.164]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:01.559]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:07.141]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:12.162]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:12.162 --> 00:07:17.724]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:22.425]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:30.069]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:31.190]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.872]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:07:37.872 --> 00:07:41.073]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:07:41.073 --> 00:07:44.174]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:44.394]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:56.921]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:01.444]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:08:01.444 --> 00:08:03.566]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.908]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.931]  It is Tuesday, the third day of November 2009.
[00:08:24.931 --> 00:08:29.913]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and 52 minutes.
[00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:34.375]  Our once a month visit with Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com is coming up.
[00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:39.638]  You can listen on your local AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave Internet Satellite.
[00:08:39.638 --> 00:08:44.760]  The free podcast right there at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.301]  Then we have William Lewis and Gary Franchi.
[00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:50.383]  They're here to interview me for part two of their FEMA film.
[00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:59.359]  You know, when I get up on the radio and I say that the world government is openly emerging and that they're launching every one of their carefully built, timed
[00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:23.570]  And prepared operations right now on us.
[00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.092]  That's because that's what's happening.
[00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:29.293]  They're federalizing the states.
[00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:30.733]  They're federalizing police.
[00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:35.716]  They're handing control over banking to private offshore consortiums.
[00:09:35.716 --> 00:09:37.397]  The IMF and World Bank.
[00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:38.697]  And UN.
[00:09:38.697 --> 00:09:44.260]  UN's private.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.763]  The Senate is set, any time now, to vote on the climate bill.
[00:09:52.301 --> 00:10:02.069]  They don't care if over 70% of Americans or over 98% of small industry and businesses are against the climate bill, the climate tax bill.
[00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:06.172]  They're going to pass it!
[00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:16.239]  And they're going to pass the new bank regulation bill that gives the banks that engineered the crisis total control over our lives and all businesses.
[00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.332]  And they're going to pass gun control bills, and they're coming after everybody.
[00:10:21.332 --> 00:10:35.359]  These are hardcore criminals that are going for broke, and they're not going to stop until grand juries at the state level start indicting these criminals, and until we grow up and realize Republicans and Democrats are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:40.102]  George Bush, a year and a half ago, got on board with the new climate treaty.
[00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:51.036]  As they tell the dumbed-down public that we're killing the Earth, and that CO2 is a deadly poison, and that we've got to tax the carbon cycle on this planet.
[00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:53.117]  That life itself is bad.
[00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:56.078]  That life is hurting life.
[00:10:56.078 --> 00:11:01.861]  It's asinine, it's a fraud, it's a ridiculous joke, and that's why the New World Order loves it.
[00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:05.843]  They revel in how ridiculous their cons and hoaxes are.
[00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:10.276]  And how certain sections of the public buy it.
[00:11:10.276 --> 00:11:18.864]  Now, the good news is, three or four years ago, most of the polls showed over 60% of Americans bought into regulating CO2 and believe it's a deadly poison.
[00:11:18.864 --> 00:11:24.049]  Now, over 70% in every major poll I see figure out it's a hoax.
[00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:27.472]  But the Congress doesn't care.
[00:11:27.472 --> 00:11:28.693]  And the White House doesn't care.
[00:11:33.174 --> 00:11:37.418]  The banks are the ones that wrote this, planned this with the oil companies.
[00:11:37.418 --> 00:11:39.420]  By the way, Dennis Kucinich has told the truth.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:54.576]  There's a Raw Story article where he gave a speech and pointed out that the insurance companies wrote the health care bill and the headline is, Kucinich says health legislation bailout for insurance companies.
[00:11:54.576 --> 00:11:55.377]  Of course it is!
[00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:03.688]  Of course, and the climate change bills were written by the stinking oil companies.
[00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:10.491]  I mean, you can Google Exxon Mobil Head says carbon tax is needed a year ago.
[00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:11.892]  They funded the whole thing.
[00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:15.914]  I mean, even if you won't go check that out for yourself, at least when you're reading Time Magazine Newsweek.
[00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:25.625]  Walking through an airport looking at BP and Exxon Mobil and Dutch Rochelle billboards and ads in newspapers.
[00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:28.208]  They're the ones propagandizing!
[00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:38.219]  I have bought magazines off the rack where half the ads lately, the last three or four months, half the ads were for the cap-and-trade bill.
[00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:46.318]  Why are the oil companies, if they hate it so much, buying half the ads in newspapers and magazines?
[00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:53.320]  Half the stinking full-page and half-page ads?
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:13:02.842]  I mean, I randomly, when I'm in an airport, go out and buy a couple magazines and newspapers to read on the plane, and literally half of the ads, because they know this is the time.
[00:13:02.842 --> 00:13:04.143]  They get this through.
[00:13:04.143 --> 00:13:08.904]  There's a direct tax by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of England,
[00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:18.886]  The Cumelobe Company and a handful of others, they're even bankrupting Citigroup, which was part of the Federal Reserve, and consolidating that.
[00:13:18.886 --> 00:13:20.788]  Bear Stearns, they're consolidating that.
[00:13:20.788 --> 00:13:33.400]  And it's come out in a 10-page detailed report in McClatchy Newspapers, Sunday, detailing everything we already reported in Fall of the Republic, how they engineered the whole thing.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.461]  JPMorgan Chase,
[00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:45.447]  And Goldman Sachs, every major regulator, every Fed Chief, every Deputy Fed Chief, every Treasury Secretary is Goldman Sachs.
[00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:50.531]  That is the inner crime syndicate.
[00:13:50.531 --> 00:14:03.122]  And you go look at all these climate change think tanks and bodies and PR firms and lobbying groups, every one of them, the number one or number two or number three funder is Goldman Sachs.
[00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:08.918]  When they're not number one or number two, guess who they are?
[00:14:08.918 --> 00:14:12.100]  The Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.062]  I mean, go read the stinking organization's own sites!
[00:14:15.062 --> 00:14:17.284]  They admit this!
[00:14:17.284 --> 00:14:21.768]  And you really gotta hand it to the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the Sachs-Coburg-Gothas.
[00:14:21.768 --> 00:14:23.249]  I mean, these people are slick.
[00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:30.578]  But they couldn't get away with this if the public wasn't so brainwashed and literally in zombie mode.
[00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:35.904]  The average person's brainwaves are much lower in a sleep state than they were just 20 years ago.
[00:14:35.904 --> 00:14:37.846]  The public is sleepwalking.
[00:14:37.846 --> 00:14:41.070]  They watch three, four, five hours of TV a day.
[00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.692]  I watch Transformers.
[00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:50.318]  Revenge of the Fallen, the last two days, running on the treadmill.
[00:14:50.318 --> 00:14:54.681]  The entire program is brainwashing.
[00:14:54.681 --> 00:15:03.829]  And the White House admits, the Congress admits, that almost all major TV programs and almost all major films
[00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:17.269]  The big films you see from front to end are purely written and authorized and paid for by the government with tax money and it's now all public.
[00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:18.910]  Now that isn't a free society.
[00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:27.494]  And ladies and gentlemen, they torture little baby robots that beg and plead and make it cute and everyone laughs when they burn their eyeballs out.
[00:15:29.144 --> 00:15:30.506]  The military is worshipped.
[00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:31.707]  Secret police are worshipped.
[00:15:31.707 --> 00:15:36.794]  The fact that everyone's cell phones track them and that we're all being face scanned and license plate scanned is admitted.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.602]  It's anti-family messages.
[00:15:43.602 --> 00:15:45.143]  The whole thing.
[00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:55.369]  And for somebody who's awake, I sit here and I watch this, and I even went and looked it up, and it's admitted that tens of millions were given to the producers by different federal agencies.
[00:15:55.369 --> 00:15:57.411]  They pay for what's written.
[00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:58.452]  It is admitted.
[00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:04.595]  There is not a major film, there is not a major production that is not New World Order funded.
[00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:13.380]  If it's a big hype production or a top TV show, you better believe the government is paying for those messages.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.981]  Now that isn't a free society.
[00:16:14.981 --> 00:16:20.984]  So the average person watches something like Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, and they are in suspended disbelief.
[00:16:20.984 --> 00:16:26.127]  They go in there, they smoke a big fat joint before they go into the movie, or they drink some whiskey in the parking lot.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:39.650]  And they stumble in there with their kids, and they sit down, and they just let themselves be bombarded by 21st century mind control, just having their psyche ripped apart.
[00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.933]  Oh, and there's humans torturing humans in the movie.
[00:16:45.327 --> 00:16:46.788]  It's fun to be tasered.
[00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:49.430]  It's fun to taser somebody when you disagree with them.
[00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.891]  It's fun to taser someone when they're upset.
[00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:57.015]  Shelling you on seeing fellow humans torn apart, murdered, killed.
[00:16:57.015 --> 00:17:05.560]  And they use archetypal images of the great hero, archetypal warrior chief, Optimus Prime, being killed to save others.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:11.484]  And so they put good, true human messages in there and then wrap it in lies.
[00:17:11.484 --> 00:17:13.085]  It's pure evil.
[00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:13.886]  And oh, by the way,
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.104]  We have a Council on Foreign Relations public blog.
[00:17:20.104 --> 00:17:26.849]  The CFR, until about a decade ago, was completely secret about their meetings, other than every two months, a bi-monthly book.
[00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:31.292]  It's a book, soft cover, gray book, called Foreign Affairs.
[00:17:31.292 --> 00:17:33.754]  It's got an equestrian on the cover.
[00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:38.258]  And that's all their deception and spin, but they admit global government, want to destroy our industry.
[00:17:38.258 --> 00:17:41.060]  I mean, there's a lot of evil in there, but they spin it.
[00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:47.222]  And people have recorded CFR meetings in Chicago where they go, yeah, we're torturing people's children.
[00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:47.942]  It's no big deal.
[00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:48.783]  We played those clips.
[00:17:48.783 --> 00:17:54.526]  John Yoo goes, yeah, it's okay for the president to order a five-year-old to have their testicles crushed.
[00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:55.227]  And yes, we do that.
[00:17:58.194 --> 00:18:03.118]  Someone inside the CFR, well, Professor Castle, he's a member, he recorded it and released it.
[00:18:03.118 --> 00:18:07.741]  Not all the members of 4,000 members are bad, but the inner steering groups are.
[00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:13.106]  Now, these guys released a blog a month ago, and it confirms everything I already told you.
[00:18:13.106 --> 00:18:14.767]  I don't need to see their documents.
[00:18:14.767 --> 00:18:16.608]  I can see the intelligence on the ground.
[00:18:16.608 --> 00:18:17.889]  And let me tell you, it isn't pretty.
[00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:23.794]  And here are these top medical doctors in the federal government and universities running the flu response.
[00:18:23.794 --> 00:18:26.095]  One of them is on this new independent federal board.
[00:18:26.095 --> 00:18:27.236]  Independent federal.
[00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:27.637]  Like saying,
[00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:30.058]  Anti-Nazi Hitler.
[00:18:30.058 --> 00:18:33.020]  It's not independent when Bush appoints the 9-11 Commission.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.281]  It's not independent when Obama appoints the board.
[00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.462]  It's not independent!
[00:18:36.462 --> 00:18:39.324]  They sit there and lie to you constantly.
[00:18:39.324 --> 00:18:52.632]  We have this Council on Foreign Relations audio recording, and they've got these top doctors on there at the CFR going, I'll tell you what we do to sell it to people.
[00:18:53.444 --> 00:19:01.371]  We tell them there's not enough of it and we dole it out slowly and they all laugh because the woman doctor stating the obvious.
[00:19:01.371 --> 00:19:13.322]  Now I told you months ago, I told you in January, they were doing drills all over the country where local police have to go to the airport and guard the flu shot delivery like militias are going to attack.
[00:19:13.322 --> 00:19:14.583]  In fact, they tell them that in the drills.
[00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:18.696]  To make the police think this is something everyone wants.
[00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:21.557]  Now, here's the difference between myself and these people.
[00:19:21.557 --> 00:19:25.539]  They enjoy using the fact that you're stupid and ignorant.
[00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:27.680]  They enjoy keeping you in the dark.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.181]  They enjoy manipulating the police and the military and the local governments.
[00:19:31.781 --> 00:19:44.612]  I mean, of course I don't need the CFR to tell me that they're doling it out and telling people they've got the vaccine and then holding it back to create news images of long lines to create a stampede by other people to go get it.
[00:19:44.612 --> 00:19:50.897]  I don't need you little supposed geniuses at the CFR to admit that to me in your blog.
[00:19:50.897 --> 00:19:51.818]  I already know that.
[00:19:52.915 --> 00:19:56.197]  But here these bastards are, giggling and snickering.
[00:19:56.197 --> 00:19:59.198]  They think it's funny manipulating people.
[00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.499]  They all need to be arrested!
[00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:02.680]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.521]  Spy on me?
[00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:03.841]  Yeah.
[00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:08.884]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:20:08.884 --> 00:20:10.524]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:20:10.524 --> 00:20:11.265]  Startpage?
[00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.766]  Yeah, startpage.com.
[00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:15.747]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:19.609]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:22.411]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:25.372]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:20:25.372 --> 00:20:26.953]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:27.253]  Right!
[00:20:27.253 --> 00:20:30.555]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:31.135]  Hello, folks.
[00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:32.496]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.496 --> 00:20:36.338]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:20:36.338 --> 00:20:40.140]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.282]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:20:45.282 --> 00:20:48.204]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.427]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:20:50.427 --> 00:20:54.713]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:55.915]  That's StartPage.com
[00:21:03.601 --> 00:21:06.823]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[00:21:06.823 --> 00:21:10.005]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:12.966]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[00:21:12.966 --> 00:21:19.410]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.932]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:24.733]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:29.937]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[00:21:29.937 --> 00:21:36.565]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:39.348]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:46.273]  A great bulk food supplies for a fraction of that.
[00:21:46.273 --> 00:21:50.315]  Our company is owned by a famous patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:21:50.315 --> 00:21:51.615]  I know you can trust him.
[00:21:51.615 --> 00:21:53.016]  He's my dad.
[00:21:53.016 --> 00:21:56.577]  Patriotfood.com is the wise choice for food insurance.
[00:21:59.178 --> 00:21:59.718]  Good day.
[00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:01.420]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.241]  November 3rd, 2009.
[00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:04.943]  Gold opened this morning at $10.59.60.
[00:22:04.943 --> 00:22:09.246]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.88.95, $5.44.48 for the half ounce, or $2.72.24 for a quarter ounce.
[00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:09.907]  That's $10.88.95, $5.44.48, or $2.72.24.
[00:22:19.114 --> 00:22:32.744]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:22:32.744 --> 00:22:33.985]  Is this capitalism?
[00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:41.570]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.691]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:46.814]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:48.116]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:49.978]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:22:49.978 --> 00:22:50.219]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.219 --> 00:22:50.519]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:01.264]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:23:01.264 --> 00:23:02.764]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:23:02.764 --> 00:23:04.105]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:23:04.105 --> 00:23:06.045]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:23:06.045 --> 00:23:14.828]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:23:14.828 --> 00:23:20.270]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.871]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:23:22.051 --> 00:23:29.534]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:33.716]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:36.437]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.

[00:23:53.626 --> 00:23:55.428]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm gonna play these clips.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:35.997]  From the Council on Foreign Relations radio blog, where they sit there, laughing at the public, talking about how, this is a month ago, just now surfaced, how they need to act like the flu shot is artificially scarce, so that people form big lines wanting it to cause mass hysteria stampede.
[00:24:35.997 --> 00:24:43.163]  Now again, we don't need to hear this from these criminals, these manipulators, to know they're doing this.
[00:24:43.163 --> 00:24:44.364]  We understand their game plan.
[00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.391]  But, I mean, do you as the public like them laughing at you thinking you're stupid?
[00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:52.092]  Do you like being conned?
[00:24:52.092 --> 00:24:56.533]  Do you like being suckered along with all of this?
[00:24:56.533 --> 00:25:08.536]  And now, the mother of all cons, the galactic-sized con of cons, the total world government takeover,
[00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:20.600]  Through the twin attacks of fake terrorism for the police state and the global carbon tax is upon us.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:33.210]  And Mrs. Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, comes and gives a speech to Congress today, pushing them to pass the treaty.
[00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.793]  The bill has passed the House.
[00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.099]  It's now in the Senate.
[00:25:40.099 --> 00:25:42.480]  The Senate committee has passed it.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.941]  It is ready.
[00:25:43.941 --> 00:25:45.541]  The debate has begun.
[00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:52.023]  They are debating on the Senate floor right now the passage of this monstrosity.
[00:25:52.023 --> 00:25:52.963]  And we've gone over the bill.
[00:25:52.963 --> 00:25:54.764]  We'll go over some more of it today.
[00:25:54.764 --> 00:25:56.124]  Home inspections.
[00:25:56.124 --> 00:25:57.365]  Total federalization.
[00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:05.715]  $10,000 a week fines if you don't leave your home when they order you to, or you don't do the upgrades, they say.
[00:26:05.715 --> 00:26:07.176]  Control over all farms.
[00:26:07.176 --> 00:26:08.636]  Control over all ranches.
[00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:13.378]  35 bureaucracies federally given unlimited power over what you do.
[00:26:13.378 --> 00:26:16.540]  Massive taxes on electricity generation.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:23.343]  Taxes on every American.
[00:26:23.343 --> 00:26:27.165]  It is unspeakable that this level of crime is being committed.
[00:26:28.371 --> 00:26:33.116]  Right now, against the people.
[00:26:33.116 --> 00:26:34.317]  They are in Congress.
[00:26:34.317 --> 00:26:37.460]  The leadership of both parties are in Congress to ram this through.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.504]  You could call it communism, socialism, fascism.
[00:26:42.504 --> 00:26:44.706]  What it is, is command and control.
[00:26:44.706 --> 00:26:49.051]  It's a select group of private interests passing a global governmental
[00:26:50.069 --> 00:27:11.442]  Coterie of laws and regulations in their own stated documents to end industry and independence in every sovereign nation on earth so that the private fiat banking paper economy can forcibly take over what's left of the real economy.
[00:27:11.442 --> 00:27:18.446]  This is the false fiat fraud economy waging war and consolidating vertically the real economy.
[00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:43.660]  And the New York Times, of all publications, comes out and admits that Al Gore's making money off of all this, but they only talk about how he got billions of dollars in stimulus money for venture capital, environmental companies he started in the U.S.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.501]  That is nothing.
[00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:48.204]  Those are like pocket change compared to his real bank account.
[00:27:50.143 --> 00:27:51.284]  Blood & Gore.
[00:27:51.284 --> 00:27:57.708]  That is the real name of the company.
[00:27:57.708 --> 00:28:06.194]  Blood & Gore, out of England, is the main carbon trading company that's been given certification by the UN, the IMF, and World Bank.
[00:28:06.194 --> 00:28:07.135]  It is the main group.
[00:28:07.135 --> 00:28:12.299]  And then there's another group in Chicago he owns the majority of, and Obama is a minority owner in it.
[00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:14.060]  I mean, you've got Obama
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.441]  These people.
[00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:20.885]  And then over in Europe, they've got these other big climate trading banks that are owned by the Rothschilds.
[00:28:20.885 --> 00:28:27.211]  Just Google Rothschild's Own Climate Credit Carbon Bank, and you'll get BBC.
[00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:28.172]  You'll get Reuters.
[00:28:28.172 --> 00:28:34.758]  I mean, it's, it's, well, we cover it all in Fall of Republic.
[00:28:34.758 --> 00:28:40.403]  That is why it is so imperative, so important, so essential.
[00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.731]  That everyone order Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:57.593]  Even if you've seen it in high quality online at PrisonPlanet.tv, they're openly saying they're going to regulate and start shutting down the web and shut it off for everyone's safety during emergencies.
[00:28:57.593 --> 00:28:58.853]  They're setting these precedents.
[00:28:58.853 --> 00:29:06.015]  We need to have it in our hands and to make copies of it so everyone understands what this is really all about.
[00:29:06.835 --> 00:29:24.262]  And I want to challenge the listeners to go to Infowars.com to click on the shop button and to buy Fall of the Republic and the Obama Deception and to make copies of it and to give it to everyone at your church, everyone at your business, everyone at your job, everybody at the shooting club, everybody at the bowling club, everybody at the golf club.
[00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:28.624]  Everyone has to get Fall of the Republic and show it to everyone out there.
[00:29:29.204 --> 00:29:33.025]  The average American doesn't read, and there's not one book that explains this all.
[00:29:33.025 --> 00:29:41.547]  This is a high-quality, slick, truthful film that people will watch that explains it A to Z. It can save the Republic!
[00:29:41.547 --> 00:29:43.948]  But you've gotta get it out to everyone!
[00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:48.409]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:50.850]  Don't wait!
[00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.250]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.771]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.771 --> 00:29:57.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.975 --> 00:30:05.279]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:09.822]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:09.822 --> 00:30:12.084]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.084 --> 00:30:13.705]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.705 --> 00:30:14.766]  There is a solution.
[00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:23.408]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:30:59.943 --> 00:31:04.044]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:06.925]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:09.006]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:11.247]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:31:11.247 --> 00:31:12.907]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:31:12.907 --> 00:31:17.209]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:32:00.913 --> 00:32:06.076]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:09.578]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:32:09.578 --> 00:32:15.301]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:17.863]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[00:32:17.863 --> 00:32:22.425]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:25.127]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[00:32:25.587 --> 00:32:31.313]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[00:32:31.313 --> 00:32:33.575]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:33.575 --> 00:32:42.124]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[00:32:42.124 --> 00:32:43.125]  Don't pick your nose.
[00:32:43.485 --> 00:32:48.067]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:53.189]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[00:32:53.189 --> 00:32:54.929]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:57.150]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.871]  Be well and stay well.
[00:32:58.871 --> 00:32:59.611]  Best MZ!
[00:33:11.052 --> 00:33:14.013]  We're not live at PrisonPlanet.tv yet.
[00:33:14.013 --> 00:33:19.576]  The radio's live, but we're not simulcasting to the television.
[00:33:19.576 --> 00:33:34.282]  But here in the studio, they loaded the images from InfoWars.com from thousands and thousands of headlines, the little image we put in the rotator at the top of the site, into the computer behind me.
[00:33:34.282 --> 00:33:35.143]  And it randomly
[00:33:36.656 --> 00:33:50.882]  Generates through those thousands and thousands of images and every time I'm sitting here during the break I'll look over at the at the computer monitor behind me and see headlines from the past.
[00:33:50.882 --> 00:34:02.386]  There's one right now where Bayer knowingly put HIV in their factor 8 blood product.
[00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:06.008]  But the clip before that little image that was up there for five seconds before that
[00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:20.459]  Was the headline, Everything Must Go, by the former head of the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, who's now in the Obama administration, and who's a member of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:25.742]  And it was an editorial he wrote for the Austin American-Statesman, titled, Everything Must Go.
[00:34:25.742 --> 00:34:27.983]  When you guys get a chance, print me that.
[00:34:27.983 --> 00:34:29.024]  It's Everything Must Go.
[00:34:29.804 --> 00:34:30.825]  Infowars.com.
[00:34:30.825 --> 00:34:32.247]  We scanned it and posted it.
[00:34:32.247 --> 00:34:43.901]  I covered that about two years ago and it was an impassioned article in the Statesman for how we should get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and how the Bill of Rights and Constitution is bad.
[00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:49.928]  I mean, these people are openly treasonous traitors who want tyranny.
[00:34:51.226 --> 00:35:00.423]  I get emails every day from fools going, I've seen your films and yes, there is a world government being set up, but that's just the natural progression of human society.
[00:35:01.351 --> 00:35:07.713]  What, to an unelected group of private robber baron banks who just so happen to have the hobby of eugenics?
[00:35:07.713 --> 00:35:09.693]  Who want to control our lives?
[00:35:09.693 --> 00:35:14.934]  And who want to get rid of all our freedoms and liberties and our private property rights so they can steal our property?
[00:35:14.934 --> 00:35:16.655]  That's the natural progression?
[00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:22.816]  No, the progression of mankind through 1776 has been away from tyranny!
[00:35:22.816 --> 00:35:24.297]  Not back into it!
[00:35:24.297 --> 00:35:25.637]  That's going in reverse!
[00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:38.882]  But these guys get up there and say, oh no, it's fancy, it's metropolitan, it's futuristic to have police tasering everyone with billy clubs and shooting people with rubber bullets.
[00:35:38.882 --> 00:35:46.685]  And then they just sit there and listen to public CFR speeches where they're giggling and laughing about how they manipulate the public.
[00:35:46.685 --> 00:35:49.325]  And we'll say there's a shortage of the vaccine.
[00:35:49.325 --> 00:35:50.766]  That'll make them want to take it.
[00:35:50.766 --> 00:35:51.586]  Ha ha ha!
[00:36:00.851 --> 00:36:18.042]  This is the type of disgusting garbage that I have to see from them, laughing at us in video and audio clips and in the books they write, laughing at us.
[00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:21.324]  It is so funny to them.
[00:36:21.324 --> 00:36:24.306]  It is so enjoyable how gullible you are.
[00:36:24.306 --> 00:36:26.688]  It is so much fun for them.
[00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:33.981]  That we've let them have the NSA take over the internet and now are openly discussing shutting it down.
[00:36:33.981 --> 00:36:41.853]  That we openly let them brag that our government grows and controls the heroin and cocaine in Asia and Latin America.
[00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:49.381]  That they openly put chemicals in our water to brain damage us and give us cancer and dumb us down.
[00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:50.622]  And that it's funny.
[00:36:50.622 --> 00:36:58.485]  And that people don't show up with pitchforks by the tens of thousands at every city hall demanding the crap be taken out of the stinking water supply.
[00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:03.162]  When in polls, over 95% of Americans want it out of the water.
[00:37:03.162 --> 00:37:04.623]  They don't care.
[00:37:04.623 --> 00:37:07.807]  You don't want a cap-and-trade tax over everything you do?
[00:37:07.807 --> 00:37:08.888]  They don't care.
[00:37:08.888 --> 00:37:11.692]  You don't want Al Gore making millions of dollars off you?
[00:37:11.692 --> 00:37:12.973]  They don't care.
[00:37:12.973 --> 00:37:18.260]  You don't like face-scanning cameras and checkpoints and having to thumbprint to go in to see your kids in public school?
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:18.921]  They don't care.
[00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:22.423]  You don't like all these endless wars?
[00:37:22.423 --> 00:37:23.144]  They don't care.
[00:37:23.144 --> 00:37:25.186]  You don't like having your Second Amendment restricted?
[00:37:25.186 --> 00:37:26.708]  They don't care.
[00:37:26.708 --> 00:37:36.159]  You don't like police from Dallas, Texas to Tucson, Arizona to New York City to Boston, Massachusetts coming to your door and asking to look at your guns with no warrant?
[00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:37.120]  They don't care!
[00:37:41.308 --> 00:37:49.915]  They have trained us that they can sit there and stomp all over us and crap on us and get away with it and that they never get in trouble.
[00:37:49.915 --> 00:37:56.180]  And what we've gotten is a broke back country that's just ready to be fully gutted, begging for it.
[00:37:58.257 --> 00:38:03.762]  And so much of the public, you know, the average person who makes $100,000 a year thinks they're a member of the elite.
[00:38:03.762 --> 00:38:13.650]  And you talk to them and they giggle and they laugh at you and they think it's cute and they address you as if they're part of the power structure and they go, yeah, a lot of it's true, but what are you going to do about it?
[00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.750]  Just join in.
[00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:20.996]  Hey, listen, jackass, if you didn't get a memo not to drink the water and not to take the shots, you ain't part of the club.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.702]  Take Germany, where all their government leaders don't take the shot.
[00:38:25.702 --> 00:38:28.604]  Or Congress, where most of Congress won't take it.
[00:38:28.604 --> 00:38:31.425]  Or Obama's kids, they're not taking the shot.
[00:38:31.425 --> 00:38:33.006]  That shot's for you!
[00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:38.549]  It's not for them!
[00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:47.414]  You aren't part of the power structure.
[00:38:47.414 --> 00:38:49.035]  You are a doormat.
[00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:53.954]  And they're done with the Western doormat.
[00:38:53.954 --> 00:38:54.494]  They're done.
[00:38:54.494 --> 00:39:00.100]  They've sucked us dry, bought off the world with our money and our energy and our military, and they're done with us!
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.261]  Hey, cops out there!
[00:39:01.261 --> 00:39:07.047]  Did you get the memo that they're putting over 150, depending on the city, some over 300 different chemicals?
[00:39:07.628 --> 00:39:10.730]  That have no reason to be in the water other than to poison your ass?
[00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.892]  Did you get the memo not to drink that buddy boy?
[00:39:13.892 --> 00:39:21.557]  Are you man enough or woman enough to go look at the evidence and then realize somebody is chemically assaulting your little brain?
[00:39:21.557 --> 00:39:23.778]  You think that's cute?
[00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:24.799]  You think that's funny?
[00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:26.961]  You think that's something you should get upset about?
[00:39:26.961 --> 00:39:33.525]  You think I'm the weirdo because I'm upset like a wild bull in a cage trying to go after these people?
[00:39:35.029 --> 00:39:42.373]  The general public's got the key to open the cage, and you're that bull as well, right in here with me.
[00:39:42.373 --> 00:39:50.577]  And I'm not chasing after the red cape that the matador hangs out in front of me of Republican and Democrat left-right paradigm.
[00:39:50.577 --> 00:39:52.338]  I know, I'm a smart bull.
[00:39:52.338 --> 00:39:59.362]  I know that matador's got a double-edged, razor-sharp, thin sword that he wants to plunge right into my chest, right into my heart.
[00:40:01.155 --> 00:40:06.409]  And I'm out here on the field and I see thousands of bulls with big swords sticking out of their chest.
[00:40:06.409 --> 00:40:08.795]  Collapsed on the ground in pools of red blood.
[00:40:10.984 --> 00:40:14.106]  And I'm telling the bulls, I'm saying, look, look, it's not the cape.
[00:40:14.106 --> 00:40:14.906]  It's not the cape.
[00:40:14.906 --> 00:40:16.207]  It's not the cape.
[00:40:16.207 --> 00:40:18.188]  The cape isn't what you go after.
[00:40:18.188 --> 00:40:21.170]  That dissipates your energy and is used as a distraction.
[00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.390]  It's the matador.
[00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.471]  It's JPMorgan Chase.
[00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:25.592]  It's Goldman Sachs.
[00:40:25.592 --> 00:40:26.472]  It's Rothschild.
[00:40:26.472 --> 00:40:27.673]  It's Rockefeller.
[00:40:27.673 --> 00:40:29.714]  It's Sachs-Coburg-Gotha.
[00:40:29.714 --> 00:40:31.115]  That's the matador.
[00:40:31.115 --> 00:40:32.536]  They've got the sword.
[00:40:32.536 --> 00:40:35.157]  And you laugh at me and you run right into the sword.
[00:40:35.157 --> 00:40:40.240]  And as the blood spews out of your big fat hearts, you sit there smiling up at the cape.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:50.263]  Torn on your horns, thinking you beat the enemy when you didn't do jack squat, but look like a stupid sucker!
[00:40:50.263 --> 00:40:51.003]  Let me tell you something.
[00:40:51.003 --> 00:40:55.084]  I see little kids at the shopping mall, at the grocery store, and it hurts my heart.
[00:40:55.084 --> 00:41:00.246]  Sweet little brain-damaged kids from vaccines and fluoride and GMO food.
[00:41:00.246 --> 00:41:04.727]  I am enraged constantly because I am normal!
[00:41:06.524 --> 00:41:07.765]  I'm normal.
[00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.507]  I was right about the world government.
[00:41:09.507 --> 00:41:11.449]  I was right about the carbon tax.
[00:41:11.449 --> 00:41:13.250]  I was right about the police state.
[00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:15.572]  I was right about government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:41:15.572 --> 00:41:21.417]  I'm a real person with my head screwed on straight who's conscious and awake and who's counted the cost.
[00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:23.139]  And it doesn't mean I'm somebody special.
[00:41:23.139 --> 00:41:24.060]  That's what's so pathetic.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.540]  I'm normal.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.561]  What are you?
[00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:27.621]  What are you?
[00:41:27.621 --> 00:41:33.502]  I'm a normal, red-blooded person who's here to defend my family and my tribe, the human race.
[00:41:33.502 --> 00:41:35.623]  I'm somebody that doesn't like bondage and slavery.
[00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:41.124]  I'm somebody that likes fair play and justice and liberty and freedom and everything good.
[00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:44.085]  Who are you?
[00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:48.906]  Are you a domesticated, smart-mouthed, know-it-all establishment type?
[00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:57.291]  Are you somebody who enjoys the petty power you've got in the system?
[00:41:57.291 --> 00:42:02.652]  Is that who you are?
[00:42:02.652 --> 00:42:07.214]  Is that who you are?
[00:42:07.214 --> 00:42:13.056]  But instead of addressing those sad, timid souls, I want to address the warriors.
[00:42:13.056 --> 00:42:16.597]  The people that understand the cost and understand what we're facing.
[00:42:16.597 --> 00:42:18.617]  And who can see through the propaganda.
[00:42:18.617 --> 00:42:20.298]  You don't have to see through it now, it's all admitted.
[00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:27.256]  Those that understand Alex Jones isn't special.
[00:42:27.256 --> 00:42:32.077]  Alex Jones has just read the Globalist documents and read a lot more than I care to read, let me tell you.
[00:42:32.077 --> 00:42:33.478]  It's hard to read this stuff.
[00:42:33.478 --> 00:42:37.219]  It's hard to listen to the CFR laughing at us.
[00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:44.021]  It's hard to listen to these con artists who think they're better than us and who've gotten it over on the public and who commit all this evil.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.726]  And they're putting their police state control grid in so they can really abuse you.
[00:42:51.726 --> 00:42:56.012]  And so you won't be able to get out the door and down the street to physically go after them.
[00:42:56.012 --> 00:43:00.599]  Even if you finally wake up and decide to do that, they've almost got their grid in place.
[00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:02.261]  And then it's going to be a lot harder to take them on.
[00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:06.250]  We better take them on in the info war right now.
[00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.891]  There is not one minute, there is not 10 seconds to wait and sit there on your hands.
[00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:13.012]  You gotta get in the fight now.
[00:43:13.012 --> 00:43:18.654]  If you don't know about this information, you're hearing this for the first time, you haven't done the research, you better do a crash course in this.
[00:43:18.654 --> 00:43:20.474]  You better stay up till 4 a.m.
[00:43:20.474 --> 00:43:24.635]  You better get up off your fat asses, excuse me folks, but that's what we're talking about here.
[00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:28.137]  Your spiritually fat butts.
[00:43:28.137 --> 00:43:30.737]  And you better learn about the real world.
[00:43:30.737 --> 00:43:32.598]  You better do it real fast.
[00:43:33.663 --> 00:43:39.646]  Because we don't have time to screw around, and I need every person we've got to wake up.
[00:43:39.646 --> 00:43:42.667]  But I will tell the people that are active this.
[00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:53.412]  I have one overriding desire, one prime directive in my psyche, in my spirit, in my heart, in who I am, in my soul.
[00:43:53.412 --> 00:44:00.935]  And that is to warn as many people as I can about what's really happening with this planetary dictatorship run by these scientific control freaks.
[00:44:03.925 --> 00:44:10.928]  And I have produced a tool, I have produced a weapon system that I want to be seen by everyone.
[00:44:10.928 --> 00:44:31.018]  And I know with our hundreds of thousands of listeners that we have every 15 minutes, we've gotten ratings from our stations, just our AM and FM alone, there are hundreds of thousands of you listening to my voice right now, hundreds of thousands listening right now on the internet, hundreds of thousands and in the aggregate millions more that will hear my message that I'm putting out today.
[00:44:31.018 --> 00:44:32.999]  If you would simply look in the mirror
[00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:37.313]  And decide that you are a leader.
[00:44:37.313 --> 00:44:40.596]  And decide that it's your job to take action against this tyranny.
[00:44:40.596 --> 00:44:51.346]  And understand that you're not going to save the world by yourself and neither am I. But all of us moving together with a single purpose are an unstoppable force.
[00:44:51.346 --> 00:44:54.828]  We've got a chance to slow this thing down and hurt it bad.
[00:44:54.828 --> 00:44:58.211]  This new world order was destined to fall from its foundation.
[00:44:58.211 --> 00:45:02.015]  But we can slow it down and bring its demise
[00:45:03.308 --> 00:45:10.454]  A little bit closer in the time-space continuum.
[00:45:10.454 --> 00:45:15.238]  And I know this, the only course is to fight these people and to boldly speak up against them.
[00:45:15.238 --> 00:45:22.004]  And when they make jokes and giggle at us to ignore them and say, listen, scum, don't try your mind games and your mind tricks with me.
[00:45:22.004 --> 00:45:26.228]  To identify them and to get cold-blooded and hard-hearted against these people.
[00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:33.501]  But to have that soft spot in our heart for the innocent and the weak and the dumbed down that we are defending.
[00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:45.306]  Because those of you that are awake have a responsibility and it is your destiny to stand up against the globalists and to do everything you can to fight them.
[00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:46.866]  And I have produced the tool.
[00:45:46.866 --> 00:45:52.268]  I have produced the weapon system that is powerful because it's the truth.
[00:45:52.268 --> 00:45:53.389]  Full of the Republic.
[00:45:54.696 --> 00:45:59.963]  And I know I'm plugging the daylights out of this today because I want these DVDs everywhere.
[00:45:59.963 --> 00:46:03.888]  I don't want you to commit to make a hundred copies until others to make copies you give it to.
[00:46:03.888 --> 00:46:10.597]  I want you to go buy a thousand blank DVDs or CDs and I want a thousand given out.
[00:46:10.597 --> 00:46:11.618]  Don't have the money?
[00:46:11.618 --> 00:46:11.939]  Bull!
[00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.724]  Sell the crap in your garage sale.
[00:46:17.724 --> 00:46:19.285]  Quit screwing around.
[00:46:19.285 --> 00:46:23.509]  If all you can afford is to buy one copy and make five or six copies, do that.
[00:46:23.509 --> 00:46:25.631]  Whatever you do, take action.
[00:46:25.631 --> 00:46:27.753]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:46:27.753 --> 00:46:28.954]  America's last stand.
[00:46:29.943 --> 00:46:35.306]  Full of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[00:46:35.306 --> 00:46:36.627]  economy by design.
[00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:42.930]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.272]  President Barack Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:46:46.272 --> 00:46:51.595]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:46:51.595 --> 00:46:52.876]  president to chair the world body.
[00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:59.762]  A scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[00:46:59.762 --> 00:47:03.165]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[00:47:03.165 --> 00:47:13.275]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a planetary neo-feudal slavery system.
[00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:17.602]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[00:47:17.602 --> 00:47:23.784]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[00:47:23.784 --> 00:47:29.465]  This film reveals the architecture of the new world order and what the power elite have in store for humanity.
[00:47:29.465 --> 00:47:34.287]  But more importantly, it communicates how we, the people, can retake control of our government.
[00:47:34.287 --> 00:47:35.387]  Turn the criminal tide.
[00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:37.808]  And bring the tyrants to justice.
[00:47:37.808 --> 00:47:39.869]  Make the choice, liberty or tyranny.
[00:47:39.869 --> 00:47:49.714]  The DVD is available at Infowars.com or call toll free to get it 888-253-3139.
[00:47:49.714 --> 00:47:55.177]  Call up if you've got the capital and buy a hundred copies of it.
[00:47:55.177 --> 00:47:58.219]  Sell it in your gas station, your grocery store.
[00:47:58.219 --> 00:48:00.480]  Sell it in your church, give it to people.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.322]  If you're a businessman and you want to buy one copy and make a million copies, do it!
[00:48:09.056 --> 00:48:10.217]  Because here's the good news.
[00:48:10.217 --> 00:48:12.398]  They're going to probably pass their climate bill.
[00:48:12.398 --> 00:48:14.919]  And they're going to pass their global banking takeover bill.
[00:48:14.919 --> 00:48:16.240]  And they pass their hate crime bill.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.141]  They're going to pass their gun grabbing bills.
[00:48:18.141 --> 00:48:19.841]  And they're going to put their North Com on the streets.
[00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:21.002]  That's already happened.
[00:48:21.002 --> 00:48:26.545]  But, in the process, people are waking up and aren't going along with it.
[00:48:26.545 --> 00:48:33.308]  And as good as the German people are, and as decadent as the American people are, we aren't going to go along with this.
[00:48:33.308 --> 00:48:35.409]  The Germans may have gone along with this.
[00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:36.930]  We're not going to go along with it.
[00:48:38.137 --> 00:48:47.042]  You may have a bunch of dumbed down, slovenly people drunk on media and TV and the death culture, but a lot of people are awake and 5% won the war against the British.
[00:48:47.042 --> 00:48:48.343]  We got way more than 5%.
[00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:53.286]  We've got more than 20% of the public who's really awake now and our numbers are growing.
[00:48:53.286 --> 00:48:54.306]  It was more like 5% a few years ago.
[00:48:56.195 --> 00:48:58.037]  We've got an exponential growth curve.
[00:48:58.037 --> 00:48:59.558]  The globalists know they're in trouble.
[00:48:59.558 --> 00:49:03.101]  That's why they're firing everything they got at us right now!
[00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:13.970]  If we can hold this position, and move forward against the enemy, and sustain our fire on them in the Info War, we may have smaller arms in the Info War.
[00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.854]  But our weapon systems have better guidance systems, and are more effective.
[00:49:19.116 --> 00:49:23.779]  More bang for the buck, because the truth can counter a mountain of lies.
[00:49:23.779 --> 00:49:27.662]  And that's what Foal of the Republic is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:27.662 --> 00:49:30.144]  And I'm telling you right now, I know the film's exploding.
[00:49:30.144 --> 00:49:33.106]  I know people are making copies of DVDs at universities everywhere.
[00:49:33.106 --> 00:49:35.407]  I know people are taking action.
[00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:41.512]  And I'll tell you, you can download it in super high quality and burn DIVX copies to regular CDs that play on most DVD players at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:42.632]  $5.95 a month, that funds us.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.823]  But I've told everybody there's a bunch of versions on YouTube for free.
[00:49:50.823 --> 00:49:54.506]  One of them is a director account, but they've plastered ads all over the front of it.
[00:49:54.506 --> 00:49:59.369]  Remind me to email that guy and tell him to stop that, ruining my film with all those ads on the front of it.
[00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:01.751]  But Change the Channel hadn't done that.
[00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:04.273]  He's got the best end code on YouTube I've seen.
[00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:13.160]  You Google Fall of the Republic YouTube, it comes up, number one link, with right at half a million views of the thousand plus versions on YouTube.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.782]  Email that link to everybody.
[00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.070]  Email that link.
[00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.351]  I mean, it's free.
[00:50:19.351 --> 00:50:22.672]  It cost me $200,000 to make the stinking thing.
[00:50:22.672 --> 00:50:24.352]  I want you to have it.
[00:50:24.352 --> 00:50:26.373]  It's free!
[00:50:26.373 --> 00:50:28.794]  Please put it on your MySpace, your Facebook.
[00:50:28.794 --> 00:50:32.215]  Please give the URL to everybody at your work and business.
[00:50:32.215 --> 00:50:34.676]  Please print off flyers with the URL.
[00:50:34.676 --> 00:50:37.316]  Please email it to your email list.
[00:50:37.316 --> 00:50:37.797]  Please!
[00:50:37.797 --> 00:50:39.397]  You want to buy Google Ads for it?
[00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:39.837]  Put it out?
[00:50:39.837 --> 00:50:40.938]  Whatever!
[00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:43.218]  All I want is to stop these bastards.
[00:50:43.218 --> 00:50:45.459]  We got a chance to do it if we'll take action.
[00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:53.883]  But we do need financial support as well, so buy the DVD and have it at the highest quality in your library to share with others at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:54.925]  This is the final battle!
[00:50:54.925 --> 00:50:55.446]  It's heating up!
[00:50:55.446 --> 00:50:55.966]  Get involved!
[00:51:00.526 --> 00:51:09.695]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:51:09.695 --> 00:51:13.058]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:51:13.058 --> 00:51:18.723]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:51:18.923 --> 00:51:23.687]  Using NASA science, oxysilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:51:23.687 --> 00:51:35.375]  Oxysilver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:51:35.515 --> 00:51:36.075]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:08.572]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:21.916]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?

[00:52:25.858 --> 00:52:29.999]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:30.719]  I think so.
[00:53:01.294 --> 00:53:02.555]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[00:53:02.555 --> 00:53:04.415]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:06.236]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[00:53:06.236 --> 00:53:11.138]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[00:53:11.138 --> 00:53:16.160]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[00:54:12.128 --> 00:54:15.350]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:20.294]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[00:54:20.294 --> 00:54:22.135]  I'm eastbound, just one more bandit run.
[00:54:22.135 --> 00:54:26.878]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[00:54:26.878 --> 00:54:30.581]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[00:54:30.581 --> 00:54:34.764]  The boys up there stickin' Atlanta, and their spirit checks our
[00:54:38.903 --> 00:54:49.538]  They sold the people of the world, especially the West, in being decadent, lackadaisical, at laughing at responsibility.
[00:54:49.538 --> 00:54:54.325]  And now we're being completely conquered by offshore banks, completely bankrupted by design.
[00:54:56.428 --> 00:55:02.730]  And the Council on Foreign Relations sits up there publicly laughing at how stupid we are and how they're manipulating us.
[00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:03.931]  And you bet I'm getting angry.
[00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:05.531]  You bet I'm upset.
[00:55:05.531 --> 00:55:23.418]  Watching Merkel, the German Chancellor, I was driving into work this morning as her speech was beginning, got in at about 10.15, right in the middle of it, watched some of it, before the Congress, telling us we've got to ratify the treaty next month, the Copenhagen Treaty that we covered yesterday.
[00:55:23.418 --> 00:55:24.979]  I'm going to cover it more at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:28.081 --> 00:55:34.205]  Simultaneously, right before her speech, the Senate marked it up to go to the full Senate.
[00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:36.947]  It's coming out of committee.
[00:55:36.947 --> 00:55:41.270]  An unelected private group of banks.
[00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:43.731]  A UN unelected body.
[00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:45.872]  I've read the treaty.
[00:55:45.872 --> 00:55:46.813]  All 200 pages.
[00:55:46.813 --> 00:55:48.414]  We covered a lot of it yesterday.
[00:55:48.414 --> 00:55:49.595]  Gonna cover it more today.
[00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:55.144]  Detailing how they're going to decide who gets contracts.
[00:55:55.144 --> 00:55:56.806]  They're going to decide who can build.
[00:55:56.806 --> 00:55:58.628]  They're going to decide who can have a company.
[00:55:58.628 --> 00:56:01.591]  They're going to be able to selectively enforce the taxes.
[00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:03.193]  It's all stated.
[00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:08.539]  And America can't get out of the treaty once we're in it unless every other signatory unanimously agrees.
[00:56:08.539 --> 00:56:09.440]  That's impossible.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.221]  That's not going to happen.
[00:56:11.311 --> 00:56:16.859]  Because we have to pay the lion's share of it, as if globalization hasn't de-industrialized us enough.
[00:56:16.859 --> 00:56:24.251]  And there's all these quotes about Maury Strong, we've got him in Fall of the Republic, where he spoke before the UN in 92 in Rio de Janeiro saying,
[00:56:25.618 --> 00:56:31.939]  It is our job to destroy the industrial society in the West, and we're going to carry this out through globalization.
[00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:43.242]  On March 20th, 1969, Dr. Richard Day, the National Medical Director of the Rockefeller-sponsored Planned Parenthood, told a meeting that American industry will be sabotaged and shown to be uncompetitive.
[00:56:43.242 --> 00:56:47.163]  In view of the recent bankruptcy of General Motors, his remarks are especially pertinent.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:57:02.491]  The stated plan was that different parts of the world should be assigned different roles of industry and commerce in a unified global system that continued preeminence of the United States and the relative independence of the self-sufficiency of the United States would have to be changed.
[00:57:02.491 --> 00:57:03.832]  This is a quote.
[00:57:03.832 --> 00:57:10.117]  In order to create a new structure you first have to tear down the old one and American industry was one example of that.
[00:57:10.117 --> 00:57:11.098]  Each part of the world
[00:57:12.025 --> 00:57:15.749]  Will have a specialty and thus become interdependent, he said.
[00:57:15.749 --> 00:57:16.229]  The U.S.
[00:57:16.229 --> 00:57:21.434]  will remain a center of agriculture.
[00:57:21.434 --> 00:57:26.620]  High-tech communications and education, but heavy industry would be transported out.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.885]  And they go on to state that that is to destroy self-sufficiency in a New World Order system.
[00:57:34.312 --> 00:57:37.595]  That's the, another quote, in a New World Order system.
[00:57:37.595 --> 00:57:41.819]  People say, well there is no New World Order, as they're openly announcing it in hundreds of publications every day.
[00:57:41.819 --> 00:57:43.841]  And then they say, what is a New World Order?
[00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:44.882]  They define it.
[00:57:44.882 --> 00:57:48.946]  Global governance by a group of private international banks.
[00:57:48.946 --> 00:57:54.911]  That's a David Rockefeller quote.
[00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:59.615]  That's the type of news and information
[00:58:00.748 --> 00:58:02.249]  That we have in front of us.
[00:58:02.249 --> 00:58:03.469]  This is what's happening.
[00:58:03.469 --> 00:58:10.233]  We're going to go live, simulcasting the live radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv for the final three hours today.
[00:58:10.233 --> 00:58:13.355]  Mike Rivero is going to be with us in the next hour.
[00:58:13.355 --> 00:58:17.857]  So go over to PrisonPlanet.tv and tune in if you want to be able to see Mike Rivero via video cam.
[00:58:18.337 --> 00:58:20.198]  And myself here in studio.
[00:58:20.198 --> 00:58:21.778]  If not, keep tuning in to the radio.
[00:58:21.778 --> 00:58:27.660]  We're going to break all this down and a lot more with Mike Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com straight ahead.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:36.223]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:58:36.223 --> 00:58:39.244]  Not to mention WhatIsTheEndgame.com and FollowTheRepublic.com.
[00:58:42.409 --> 00:58:45.011]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.011 --> 00:58:50.094]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.094 --> 00:58:54.657]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.657 --> 00:58:59.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.743]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.743 --> 00:59:05.484]  It's true.
[00:59:05.484 --> 00:59:10.027]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.347 --> 00:59:11.168]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.168 --> 00:59:14.751]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:18.675]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.675 --> 00:59:19.476]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.476 --> 00:59:22.238]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.238 --> 00:59:25.922]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.922 --> 00:59:26.702]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.702 --> 00:59:30.846]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.846 --> 00:59:35.611]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.891 --> 00:59:40.054]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.054 --> 00:59:41.855]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.855 --> 00:59:44.097]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.097 --> 00:59:46.718]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.718 --> 00:59:55.604]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.604 --> 01:00:05.031]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:05.611]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.317 --> 01:00:08.078]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.078 --> 01:00:09.840]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.421]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.421 --> 01:00:12.322]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.322 --> 01:00:17.186]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.186 --> 01:00:24.131]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.131 --> 01:00:28.335]  The fall of our precious republic is happening right now.
[01:00:29.707 --> 01:00:42.112]  The so-called bank re-regulation legislation openly gives unlimited power to less than four private banks and brokerage firms to regulate all financial activities in the United States.
[01:00:42.112 --> 01:00:52.997]  Simultaneously, the other 19 members of the G20 are passing identical or close to identical legislation to tie in to this new private bank of the world.
[01:00:52.997 --> 01:00:54.478]  Part of the taxing mechanism
[01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:58.601]  Is to be the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[01:00:58.601 --> 01:01:02.833]  The House has passed the accompanying legislation, admittedly to go under UN control.
[01:01:04.002 --> 01:01:05.963]  It states this is for global governance.
[01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:06.423]  The U.S.
[01:01:06.423 --> 01:01:08.283]  will not be allowed out of this.
[01:01:08.283 --> 01:01:10.784]  It will more than double, in their own words, U.S.
[01:01:10.784 --> 01:01:11.664]  energy prices.
[01:01:11.664 --> 01:01:14.005]  It will micromanage every facet of your life.
[01:01:14.005 --> 01:01:15.946]  Taxes on anything that produces carbon.
[01:01:15.946 --> 01:01:18.546]  Your dog, owning a dog as it eats meat.
[01:01:18.546 --> 01:01:20.567]  Beef will cost more money.
[01:01:20.567 --> 01:01:23.848]  Total control over thousands of facets of your lives.
[01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:27.069]  This is hell on earth and is unelected and unaccountable.
[01:01:28.274 --> 01:01:41.399]  The next 30 minutes or so, we're joined by Mike Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com, fellow GCN radio host, and he joins us now from Hawaii via video cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:01:41.399 --> 01:01:51.222]  Mike, I want to get into climate bill going out of the committee in the Senate today, right as Merkel gave her speech to the House calling for the passage of the treaty next month.
[01:01:51.222 --> 01:01:53.063]  We're now 34 days out and counting.
[01:01:53.903 --> 01:01:59.592]  I want to then get into the open admissions that the CIA is controlling the opium out of Afghanistan at record levels.
[01:02:00.632 --> 01:02:02.914]  The open announcement they're killing the dollar.
[01:02:02.914 --> 01:02:04.916]  My God, this is really happening.
[01:02:04.916 --> 01:02:06.977]  Mike Rivero, good to have you with us.
[01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:09.840]  Aloha, thank you for having me on the show again today.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.725]  And you're absolutely right, this whole push for globalism, it should be scaring everybody.
[01:02:15.725 --> 01:02:19.949]  I mean, you look at the news and it's just nothing but total fear-mongering.
[01:02:19.949 --> 01:02:24.973]  And I've been saying on my own show that obviously this push for globalism rests on three foundations.
[01:02:24.973 --> 01:02:26.995]  The first was human-caused global warming.
[01:02:27.615 --> 01:02:31.338]  Even Al Gore is backing off from that, and he's just calling it climate change now.
[01:02:31.338 --> 01:02:34.961]  And I don't know if you've heard about his new sequel to Inconvenient Truth.
[01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:37.783]  He's not trying to push it on a scientific basis.
[01:02:37.783 --> 01:02:42.527]  He's now promoting the fight against global change as a spiritual quest.
[01:02:42.527 --> 01:02:52.355]  In other words, he couldn't sell it as science, so he's repackaging it as a religion that worships the Earth, and the way you worship the Earth is you throw your carbon taxes into the little wood plate as it gets passed.
[01:02:52.415 --> 01:02:53.556]  Well, that's phase two.
[01:02:53.556 --> 01:03:03.863]  You buy your carbon indulgences like people would buy indulgences from the Catholic Church 500 years ago, and that's in the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 96.
[01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.005]  They say they're going to make it a global religion.
[01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:13.045]  Yeah, they're really trying to do it and they're trying to push the religion angle because they realize the science is falling apart on them.
[01:03:13.045 --> 01:03:21.308]  The second foundation, as you pointed out, they're trying to create a global federal authority to deal with this manufactured global financial crisis.
[01:03:21.308 --> 01:03:22.189]  But here's the problem.
[01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:26.912]  What they want to put in place is just a larger version of the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:26.912 --> 01:03:38.159]  And we already know the failing of the Federal Reserve is the instant that first borrowed manufactured piece of money goes into circulation, more money is owed to the bank than is actually in existence.
[01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:39.280]  If you're on a planet
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.341]  We're good to go.
[01:04:04.744 --> 01:04:10.729]  The greatest debtor nation in history, statistically worse than even the Great Depression for two years.
[01:04:10.729 --> 01:04:14.772]  We passed that benchmark two years ago and you're absolutely right.
[01:04:14.772 --> 01:04:17.294]  The banks though, they say they fail.
[01:04:17.294 --> 01:04:21.297]  They've really succeeded in vertical integration.
[01:04:21.297 --> 01:04:29.383]  That's why McClatchy newspapers have done this big detailed report by Greg Gordon, how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[01:04:29.383 --> 01:04:31.865]  housing crash to bring down their competition.
[01:04:33.157 --> 01:04:34.058]  Yeah, they did that.
[01:04:34.058 --> 01:04:37.502]  They also, I mean, Dave Goldman Sachs is playing all these little dirty tricks.
[01:04:37.502 --> 01:04:40.405]  They dumped all the subprimes on foreign bankers.
[01:04:40.405 --> 01:04:49.415]  They made money off the California bonds, selling them, then they turned around and told their own clients, bet against them, and they made more money on the credit default swaps on those same bonds.
[01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:50.575]  Stay there.
[01:04:50.575 --> 01:04:53.936]  I want to talk more about whether you think they're going to be able to pass this treaty in the Senate.
[01:04:53.936 --> 01:04:55.236]  It looks like they are.
[01:04:55.236 --> 01:04:57.416]  How we fight that once they pass it.
[01:04:57.416 --> 01:04:58.617]  The government drug dealing.
[01:04:58.617 --> 01:04:59.757]  All of it with Mike Rivero.
[01:04:59.757 --> 01:05:00.357]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.357 --> 01:05:08.018]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:05:08.018 --> 01:05:14.119]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:16.760]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:23.343]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:05:23.343 --> 01:05:27.425]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:27.425 --> 01:05:32.787]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:05:33.047 --> 01:05:35.129]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:05:35.129 --> 01:05:36.871]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:05:36.871 --> 01:05:39.393]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:05:39.393 --> 01:05:44.137]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:05:44.137 --> 01:05:47.841]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:05:47.841 --> 01:05:50.964]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:50.964 --> 01:05:52.865]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:54.987]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:01.238 --> 01:06:04.902]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:04.902 --> 01:06:08.505]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.505 --> 01:06:13.289]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.289 --> 01:06:19.695]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.695 --> 01:06:21.938]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:22.758]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:22.758 --> 01:06:23.278]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.278 --> 01:06:23.899]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:23.899 --> 01:06:24.619]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:24.619 --> 01:06:26.740]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:48.647]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.647 --> 01:06:57.749]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:08.917]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:08.917 --> 01:07:12.279]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:18.164]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:22.927]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:22.927 --> 01:07:25.289]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.929]  I'm good.
[01:07:42.219 --> 01:07:42.679]  Big Brother.
[01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:43.499]  Mainstream Media.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.081]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:11.642]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.642 --> 01:08:12.563]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.563 --> 01:08:17.406]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.406 --> 01:08:21.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:27.133]  We're eight minutes into hour number two, this third day of November.
[01:08:27.133 --> 01:08:29.855]  It's Tuesday edition, 2009.
[01:08:29.855 --> 01:08:32.757]  Mike Ribeiro is our guest for stations that just joined us.
[01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:41.753]  The Climate Treaty has accompanying legislation in every nation of the planet that's signing on to it.
[01:08:41.753 --> 01:08:58.981]  And the House and Senate versions openly give 35 federal agencies complete control, dictatorial power, extra judicial outside the courts to take over all facets of society, including attacks on all children.
[01:09:00.267 --> 01:09:11.964]  California is on the verge of passing legislation, last time I saw it a month ago it may have passed, to take away the tax credit on children and then to begin taxing having more than one child.
[01:09:14.346 --> 01:09:18.508]  Australia, England, Canada, all the globalist nations are going along with this.
[01:09:18.508 --> 01:09:20.069]  Europe's going along with it.
[01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:27.152]  And now Merkel, the German Chancellor, just completed an hour ago a speech before the House calling for the passage.
[01:09:27.152 --> 01:09:30.254]  The Senate has marked it up to go to the full Senate.
[01:09:30.254 --> 01:09:32.435]  Debate has now begun on this.
[01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:36.097]  Mike Rivero breaking this down.
[01:09:37.421 --> 01:09:46.771]  From your research, what's in the bill, what it does, the New York Times is admitting what we talked about years ago, that Gore is making billions of dollars off of this, that the U.N.
[01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:54.880]  and others are only going to give the carbon contracts to him and his company, Blood and Gore, literally the partners name Blood in England, no joke there.
[01:09:55.581 --> 01:10:01.004]  It's admitted that Obama owns part of the mercantile that's going to be trading this in Chicago.
[01:10:01.004 --> 01:10:09.308]  This is where the bankers who've been waging war against the real economy, criminally consolidating it, now will have government power to shut down all their competition.
[01:10:09.308 --> 01:10:12.149]  I mean, this is the worst possible nightmare.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:22.402]  Yeah, we've been seeing it for a long time where the Federal Reserve and its affiliated banks use the courts and use the government to go after any possible competing banking systems.
[01:10:22.402 --> 01:10:24.663]  We saw what happened to Abraham Lincoln and his Greenbacks.
[01:10:24.663 --> 01:10:28.564]  We saw what happened to JFK and his Executive Order 11110.
[01:10:28.564 --> 01:10:35.985]  This is absolutely the financial enslavement of the human race if we continue to believe in their system of money.
[01:10:35.985 --> 01:10:42.507]  One of the things that really alarms me greatly about this global empire, it's got to have a single
[01:10:43.107 --> 01:10:43.407]  I think?
[01:10:58.152 --> 01:10:58.352]  I think?
[01:11:13.932 --> 01:11:22.839]  Somewhere between now and the success of a global government is a war between Christians and Muslims that they've been trying to generate now for years.
[01:11:22.839 --> 01:11:25.020]  Ooh, bad Islam, bad Muslims.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.261]  We've got to go kill them.
[01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:28.603]  You keep hearing that phrase, clash of civilizations.
[01:11:28.603 --> 01:11:32.246]  It's a clash of banking systems is what this is all about.
[01:11:34.867 --> 01:11:47.219]  Mike, looking at this, they're now saying, and Feinstein and Boxer that are honchoing this in the Senate to pass the House, they don't normally say something's going to pass unless it is.
[01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:49.701]  They say health care is going to pass.
[01:11:49.701 --> 01:11:52.684]  They say the carbon tax is going to pass.
[01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:54.265]  All of these are taxes to the banks.
[01:11:55.505 --> 01:12:01.107]  Uh, looks like we can try to call Congress, get the buzz going, warn people.
[01:12:01.107 --> 01:12:02.448]  A, do you think it's going to pass?
[01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:08.590]  And B, as they incrementally try to enforce it, what should our resistance to this be?
[01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.630]  State sovereignty?
[01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.591]  States saying they're not going along with it?
[01:12:11.591 --> 01:12:12.151]  What should we do?
[01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:16.017]  Well, definitely we have to resist it by any means possible.
[01:12:16.017 --> 01:12:21.682]  I mean, going back for an entire year, we've seen that Congress absolutely is not concerned with the will of the people.
[01:12:21.682 --> 01:12:28.208]  They passed the TARP and the bailout despite 90% phone calls to the Congress saying, no, do not give our money to Congress.
[01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:33.153]  Now, Obama's talking about a second stimulus, even as the first one fails to accomplish anything.
[01:12:33.153 --> 01:12:34.414]  It is very clearly
[01:12:34.774 --> 01:12:36.955]  The government has been co-opted.
[01:12:36.955 --> 01:12:40.056]  The government of the United States has co-opted into this globalist agenda.
[01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:47.920]  They're taking all the wealth away from the common people to concentrate it at the top, from which they will use it to dictate how the world is going to run.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.861]  Now, we already know the world is overpopulated.
[01:12:51.281 --> 01:13:02.387]  So, if we get a global government with a Hitler-type mentality at the top, what is going to happen to those portions of the world's population that are deemed non-essential or non-productive?
[01:13:02.387 --> 01:13:03.567]  What is going to happen to them?
[01:13:03.567 --> 01:13:18.435]  And before you answer that question, go back and look at National Security Study Memorandum 200, that was official US policy during the Nixon administration, which called for overt and covert methods of birth control to reduce the world's population.
[01:13:19.599 --> 01:13:21.201]  Well let me expand on that.
[01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:28.872]  Yesterday I showed the headlines in Canada, Australia and England with their environment ministers on the same day.
[01:13:29.858 --> 01:13:42.170]  Three months ago saying, we must cut our population by half, we must raise taxes on people that have children, that is in the Copenhagen Treaty, to make them not have children.
[01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:53.360]  That's how it began in 75 in China, then in 81 it became law, and the headline was, in the London Guardian, England must cut population to 30 million.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.942]  That's by half, there's 60 million.
[01:13:56.175 --> 01:14:07.119]  The diabolicalness of this, the diabolical nature, is what I think a lot of people have trouble coming to grips with, and a lot of yuppies think, well good, get rid of those third world people.
[01:14:07.119 --> 01:14:14.542]  They don't understand that the globalist number one group they're targeting is actually Westerners, regardless of color.
[01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:21.704]  And we've gotten the internal audio tapes of Planned Parenthood, where they're talking about their mission being getting rid of the black people.
[01:14:21.704 --> 01:14:22.525]  And we have the
[01:14:23.607 --> 01:14:28.831]  Documents that came out with Margaret Sanger calling black subhuman that had to be killed.
[01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:33.134]  But these are modern audio tapes that were all over the news this year and last year.
[01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:42.180]  So the issue is they're going after everybody and they're telling the third world the cap and trade will hurt the greedy Americans and British and Germans and French.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:49.766]  Selling it to them as a divide and conquer strategy when really this is an attack against everyone as the British Commission on Population stated.
[01:14:50.762 --> 01:15:00.846]  Well, what you need to understand is from the point of view of the bankers and the globalists, the people they want to die and leave the planet are those who work the least while consuming the most.
[01:15:00.846 --> 01:15:06.549]  The ones who will be kept alive are those willing to work the hardest and expect and demand the least amount in return.
[01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:14.375]  The ultimate agenda for any government in history is to extract the most work product from their population for the least amount of support going back.
[01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:26.946]  So if you're willing to work 80 hours a week for a loincloth and a bowl of rice, you are much more valuable to the bankers than somebody who works, you know, flex time 25-30 hours a week and wants to drive a BMW.
[01:15:26.946 --> 01:15:28.147]  You're absolutely right.
[01:15:28.147 --> 01:15:35.113]  And let me read a quote from the UN dais, Maury Strong, 1992, Rio de Janeiro, head of the Earth Summit.
[01:15:36.443 --> 01:15:41.027]  Isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse?
[01:15:41.027 --> 01:15:43.109]  Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?
[01:15:43.109 --> 01:15:57.481]  Then another quote by key agent of the Rockefeller family, Dr. Richard Day, the National Medal Director of the Rockefeller-sponsored Planned Parenthood, told a meeting in March of 69 that American industry will be sabotaged and shown to be un...
[01:15:58.464 --> 01:16:16.735]  Competitive he said the stated plan was that different parts of the world would be assigned different roles of industry and commerce in a unified global system that continued preeminence of the United States and the related independence and self-sufficiency of the United States would have to be changed in order to create a new structure you first have to tear down the old
[01:16:17.515 --> 01:16:19.837]  And American industry was one example of that.
[01:16:19.837 --> 01:16:25.041]  Each part of the world will have a speciality and thus become interdependent, he said.
[01:16:25.041 --> 01:16:25.402]  The U.S.
[01:16:25.402 --> 01:16:31.627]  will remain the center for agriculture, high-tech communications, and education, but heavy industry would be transported out.
[01:16:31.627 --> 01:16:40.675]  Now, this is all stated thousands of different places and hundreds of different ways, but the issue here is that
[01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:45.755]  They're doing all this to make us dependent on government.
[01:16:45.755 --> 01:16:47.796]  They are stating this.
[01:16:47.796 --> 01:16:50.779]  This is such a criminal hijacking.
[01:16:50.779 --> 01:16:52.741]  This is neo-feudalism.
[01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:53.701]  This is serfdom.
[01:16:53.701 --> 01:16:57.885]  These people are mortal enemies of anyone that wants freedom and liberty.
[01:16:57.885 --> 01:17:01.668]  And remember how they throw this in our face through movies, which they now admit they're funding.
[01:17:01.668 --> 01:17:02.789]  Rollerball.
[01:17:02.789 --> 01:17:04.750]  What, 1974?
[01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.433]  Where you have the different energy cities.
[01:17:08.663 --> 01:17:13.669]  Because once the globalists have a world government, they're even going to break it into sub-regions.
[01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:16.813]  And that's their plan.
[01:17:16.813 --> 01:17:20.038]  I mean, it is so unbelievably wicked, Mike Rivera.
[01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.063]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:22.063 --> 01:17:29.029]  It's basically, again, and every time I hear the phrase global government, the first thing I think of is, that's what Alexander the Great wanted.
[01:17:29.029 --> 01:17:30.410]  That's what Napoleon wanted.
[01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:32.152]  That's what the Roman Caesars wanted.
[01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:33.513]  That's what Hitler wanted.
[01:17:33.513 --> 01:17:40.459]  And in the middle of all this empire building, the ordinary people who just wanted to be left alone to live their lives and raise their children were crushed.
[01:17:40.939 --> 01:17:46.965]  There has never been a push for global government that did not involve the complete enslavement of the common people.
[01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:48.806]  As you say, this is neo-feudalism.
[01:17:48.806 --> 01:17:55.472]  They're trying to end the American Republic, the democracy experiment, and take us back to enforced serfdom.
[01:17:55.472 --> 01:17:59.356]  We will be attached to the land, we'll be considered part of the wealth of the land, and there will be
[01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:03.158]  Titles of nobility to those who control large tracts of land.
[01:18:03.158 --> 01:18:06.841]  It's going back to the 12th century politically.
[01:18:06.841 --> 01:18:12.044]  And we're already seeing this in our own government that has abandoned the presumption of innocence.
[01:18:12.044 --> 01:18:16.607]  You have to prove that you're innocent now or you wind up being tortured until you confess something.
[01:18:16.607 --> 01:18:19.189]  I mean, even the Magna Carta said you're not allowed to do that.
[01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:24.853]  And our government has gone back before that in the way that they're handling the prisoners from these wars.
[01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:34.322]  Mike, you're absolutely right, and my film Fall of the Republic details how the establishment is carrying this operation out.
[01:18:35.479 --> 01:18:38.880]  I don't see this working for the establishment, though.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.342]  Sure, they can claim they control all issuance of currency and credit.
[01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:47.104]  They can try to restrict people's resources to control them.
[01:18:47.104 --> 01:18:49.205]  They can try to force one-child policies.
[01:18:49.205 --> 01:18:57.268]  But as the public learns about the shadow government, as they learn about the private fellow reserve, as they learn about the real paradigm, which the suppression
[01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:00.470]  We'll encourage them to do, and is happening now.
[01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.071]  Resistance is going to mount.
[01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:14.278]  That's why they preemptively in their own documents admitted this is neo-serfdom, feudalism, and that they're bringing in this electronic police state straitjacket, but I don't see that succeeding as well.
[01:19:14.278 --> 01:19:15.639]  This is going to be explosive.
[01:19:16.499 --> 01:19:17.479]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:19:17.479 --> 01:19:22.240]  I don't think they're getting, that this is moving along anywhere near as smoothly as they wanted.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:29.942]  First of all, for the foundation that was resting on global warming, the fact that the Earth is cooling has damaged the credibility of the globalist movement as a whole.
[01:19:29.942 --> 01:19:35.063]  The same thing with attempting to sell a global health authority on the basis of the swine flu.
[01:19:35.063 --> 01:19:37.283]  That's not coming out as predicted.
[01:19:37.283 --> 01:19:42.704]  And selling more globalism to fix the economy that was already destroyed by globalism, that's a tough sell.
[01:19:42.704 --> 01:19:43.945]  I don't think they can make it.
[01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:44.885]  I think they may actually just
[01:19:45.365 --> 01:19:49.751]  Bring down all of civilization in a ruin trying to bring about this new world order.
[01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.331]  You're right.
[01:19:50.331 --> 01:19:53.315]  And they have corrupt bureaucrats running the system.
[01:19:53.315 --> 01:19:56.880]  And so, they're having a lot of problems.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.500]  Stay there, Mike.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.682]  We'll talk about government drug dealing.
[01:20:01.024 --> 01:20:11.936]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[01:20:11.936 --> 01:20:16.100]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.262]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:18.262 --> 01:20:23.728]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:23.868 --> 01:20:33.895]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:40.399]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:20:40.399 --> 01:20:43.742]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:20:43.742 --> 01:20:45.823]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:20:45.823 --> 01:20:48.865]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:52.066]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:52.066 --> 01:20:54.246]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:54.246 --> 01:20:57.887]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:20:57.887 --> 01:21:02.348]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[01:21:18.491 --> 01:21:20.372]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.372 --> 01:21:25.755]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:28.857]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:21:28.857 --> 01:21:35.700]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.042]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:39.622]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.622 --> 01:21:42.084]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.084 --> 01:21:44.225]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.225 --> 01:21:45.746]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[01:21:46.446 --> 01:21:49.351]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:22:01.266 --> 01:22:02.307]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.307 --> 01:22:07.830]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:08.370]  I get it.
[01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:17.996]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:17.996 --> 01:22:19.157]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.397 --> 01:22:27.885]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:27.885 --> 01:22:31.268]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.268 --> 01:22:35.532]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.532 --> 01:22:37.154]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.154 --> 01:22:40.557]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:40.557 --> 01:22:44.701]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:44.901 --> 01:22:45.801]  You should too.
[01:22:45.801 --> 01:22:46.942]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:46.942 --> 01:22:50.323]  Call us and I'll send you 10 Reasons Why Global Do Very Well, free.

[01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:50.663]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.663 --> 01:22:50.843]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:07.146]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity with a free kit.
[01:23:07.146 --> 01:23:08.387]  First, the facts.
[01:23:08.387 --> 01:23:11.050]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.
[01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:16.635]  $700 billion for TARP, $122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[01:23:16.635 --> 01:23:17.476]  The result?
[01:23:17.476 --> 01:23:23.241]  A deficit of over $1.8 trillion and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above 20%.
[01:23:25.843 --> 01:23:27.304]  Now the good news.
[01:23:27.304 --> 01:23:36.607]  Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter, created a free inflation survival kit.
[01:23:36.607 --> 01:23:42.589]  The kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much as $431,000 in 12 to 18 months.

[01:24:12.286 --> 01:24:14.348]  Mike, in closing in this short segment,
[01:24:16.243 --> 01:24:19.487]  I want to get into government drug dealing in Afghanistan and Colombia.
[01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:24.453]  But first, Al Gore, again, admittedly to make the profits from all of this.
[01:24:24.453 --> 01:24:25.555]  This is racketeering.
[01:24:25.555 --> 01:24:27.077]  I mean, he should get in trouble for this.
[01:24:27.077 --> 01:24:30.081]  We need to really start calling them out as the criminals they are.
[01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:32.471]  We absolutely need to do that.
[01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:42.680]  What most people don't understand is when Al Gore set up this cap-and-credit CO2 tax scheme, he got help from Ken Lay, from Enron.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:48.985]  In other words, Al Gore is doing to us with carbon dioxide what Enron did to California with electricity.
[01:24:48.985 --> 01:24:51.527]  They're not actually doing anything that's useful.
[01:24:51.527 --> 01:24:56.271]  They're simply setting up a system that siphons money off and makes them very, very, very rich.
[01:24:56.271 --> 01:24:57.152]  Yes, it's a crime.
[01:24:57.552 --> 01:25:03.418]  It's a scam, and as long as we the people just sit there and go along with it, you know, there has to be a breaking point at some time.
[01:25:03.418 --> 01:25:07.762]  I mean, I've got friends who are calling me, asking to borrow money to make their rent.
[01:25:07.762 --> 01:25:11.105]  I'm having to tell them, no, we're just barely making our rent here.
[01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:17.632]  At some point, when enough people have been made homeless and enough businesses have been shut down, the American people have got to get angry.
[01:25:17.632 --> 01:25:19.433]  There really is no other, you know...
[01:25:20.975 --> 01:25:25.841]  That's what Northcom's for, and we now know this was all premeditated and planned.
[01:25:25.841 --> 01:25:29.745]  Goldman Sachs engineering it with the Federal Reserve to collapse the economy.
[01:25:29.745 --> 01:25:31.367]  That's McClatchy Newspapers.
[01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:33.209]  We've got the reporter coming on later.
[01:25:33.209 --> 01:25:36.913]  But in closing here, what about the treaty?
[01:25:37.754 --> 01:25:41.775]  To build giant bases in Colombia to attack Venezuela.
[01:25:41.775 --> 01:25:42.255]  The U.S.
[01:25:42.255 --> 01:25:46.416]  forces only spray the coca plantations that the FARC control.
[01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:48.537]  Our government's growing the cocaine.
[01:25:48.537 --> 01:25:53.458]  Afghanistan, it's up 10, 12, 13 fold what it was a decade ago, opium.
[01:25:53.458 --> 01:25:57.859]  They admit in the news that the CIA runs the drugs with the head drug dealer.
[01:25:57.859 --> 01:26:02.480]  Meanwhile, the police are still SWAT teaming people for using the drugs the government ships in.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.121]  What about, I mean, it's just, all of this stuff's coming to the surface, but no one gets in trouble.
[01:26:08.533 --> 01:26:09.654]  Well, it's absolutely true.
[01:26:09.654 --> 01:26:13.857]  I mean, basically, the war on drugs is simply a war on the competition's drugs.
[01:26:13.857 --> 01:26:21.483]  And they want to make sure it's a monopoly that is controlled by the American drug lord families, including the Bushes and the Clintons.
[01:26:21.483 --> 01:26:23.144]  And that's what it's really all about.
[01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:27.307]  When the Taliban was in control of Afghanistan, there was no opium growing.
[01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:27.807]  The U.S.
[01:26:27.807 --> 01:26:29.549]  comes in, it's bumper crops.
[01:26:29.549 --> 01:26:32.531]  We've got cheap, potent heroin flooding into the United States.
[01:26:32.531 --> 01:26:33.972]  It's Vietnam all over again.
[01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:39.014]  Young people are dying from overdoses and our government is making the money from it.
[01:26:39.014 --> 01:26:42.616]  That's why all these anti-drug commercials you see on TV are lame.
[01:26:42.616 --> 01:26:43.716]  They don't work.
[01:26:43.716 --> 01:26:50.119]  They're designed to make it look like the government cares, but they're designed to utterly fail to convince anybody to stay away from drugs.
[01:26:50.119 --> 01:26:54.901]  Well, look at all the pro-drug messages in Hollywood movies where it's so fun.
[01:26:54.901 --> 01:26:57.082]  We know that's government propaganda placement.
[01:26:57.962 --> 01:26:59.084]  And it's on record.
[01:26:59.084 --> 01:27:08.915]  Every cop I talk to, whether I'm in LA or New York or Austin, I talk to cops when I see them at restaurants and I go, don't you guys know most of the money is laundered from drugs, is laundered in U.S.
[01:27:08.915 --> 01:27:11.177]  banks, and that we only go after the competition?
[01:27:11.177 --> 01:27:12.419]  They go, yeah, we know that.
[01:27:13.454 --> 01:27:16.996]  But then they get promoted when they bust some teenager with it.
[01:27:16.996 --> 01:27:22.579]  By making the drugs illegal, it jacks up the prices, brings more drugs in, bad quality drugs.
[01:27:22.579 --> 01:27:27.101]  We know under Prohibition, alcoholism tripled, that's admitted, mainline history.
[01:27:27.101 --> 01:27:29.622]  We know it energized the mob.
[01:27:29.622 --> 01:27:34.105]  The criminals made drugs illegal because they wanted to jack up the price.
[01:27:35.148 --> 01:27:36.109]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:38.351]  They call it the politics of contraband.
[01:27:38.351 --> 01:27:45.856]  And I mean, the prohibition, the amount of money that came in from prohibition to the criminals completely reshaped American politics.
[01:27:45.856 --> 01:27:50.260]  The whole Kennedy dynasty is founded on illegal alcohol money.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:54.423]  The Skull and Bones fraternity at Yale University was funded with opium money.
[01:27:54.423 --> 01:27:56.745]  It's all about drugs and control of the drugs.
[01:27:57.345 --> 01:28:00.028]  Hollywood always says the drug lords are down in South America.
[01:28:00.028 --> 01:28:06.134]  No, the drug lords are right here in the United States of America sitting in taxpayer-funded offices.
[01:28:06.134 --> 01:28:07.095]  And they have the U.S.
[01:28:07.095 --> 01:28:07.795]  military.
[01:28:07.795 --> 01:28:17.265]  If you don't pay your cut or launder your money with them, and I've talked to high-level military DEA people that track the flights, they're told, leave those ten flights alone, go after those two.
[01:28:17.865 --> 01:28:21.308]  Every time they bust the CIA with drugs in the U.S., they're told let them go.
[01:28:21.308 --> 01:28:32.219]  I've had Terry Reid and other high-level CIA people on the show about MENA seeing Bill Clinton and Oliver North with the cocaine, and then they call them big patriot heroes.
[01:28:33.257 --> 01:28:34.038]  Yeah, it is.
[01:28:34.038 --> 01:28:35.178]  It is really absurd.
[01:28:35.178 --> 01:28:41.942]  I mean, all the excesses that we were told were happening down in South America, they happen times ten here in the United States.
[01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:44.184]  It is that completely out of control.
[01:28:44.184 --> 01:28:52.189]  And now the druggies, they want to buy themselves an entire planet because the drug lords and the drug money and the banks are all tied in together.
[01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:56.031]  If the drug money went away, most American banks would collapse.
[01:28:56.031 --> 01:28:56.892]  And let's explain this.
[01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:05.332]  They can leverage on average 8 to 10 times, so 500 billion in opium a year out of Afghanistan, that's 5 trillion leverage.
[01:29:05.332 --> 01:29:06.352]  Go ahead.
[01:29:06.352 --> 01:29:08.592]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[01:29:08.592 --> 01:29:23.816]  When Michael Mann was producing the original Miami Vice TV series in the third season, he started taking some chances and he did an episode in which the good guys are called off a drug bust because if they busted this particular drug dealer, it would have destroyed a couple of the big banks in Florida.
[01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.157]  And they were told, you gotta stay away from this one.
[01:29:26.157 --> 01:29:26.997]  We're sorry.
[01:29:26.997 --> 01:29:29.019]  It's just that big and that powerful.
[01:29:29.019 --> 01:29:31.140]  The money is too powerful to fight.
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.900]  And it's all about the money.
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.661]  And it's all counterfeit money.
[01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:38.283]  We have been taught to worship the dollar as a new religion.
[01:29:38.283 --> 01:29:39.604]  And there's nothing behind it.
[01:29:39.604 --> 01:29:42.025]  It's just a funny printed piece of paper.
[01:29:42.025 --> 01:29:43.426]  Now they're trying to come up with another one.
[01:29:43.426 --> 01:29:44.366]  The carbon credit.
[01:29:44.366 --> 01:29:46.547]  That too is just a funny printed piece of paper.
[01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:47.928]  And we've been taught to worship Al Gore.
[01:29:47.928 --> 01:29:48.628]  Great job, Mike.
[01:29:48.628 --> 01:29:49.429]  Talk to you again soon.
[01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:54.023]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.023 --> 01:29:57.646]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.987 --> 01:30:03.988]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:03.988 --> 01:30:09.309]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.309 --> 01:30:11.370]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:16.372]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.372 --> 01:30:17.552]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.552 --> 01:30:18.672]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.672 --> 01:30:20.553]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:21.633]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.633 --> 01:30:23.834]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.834 --> 01:30:25.174]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.174 --> 01:30:26.695]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.695 --> 01:30:27.755]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:30:27.915 --> 01:30:29.237]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:30:29.237 --> 01:30:31.960]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.545]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.545 --> 01:30:39.370]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:40.612]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.612 --> 01:30:41.493]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.493 --> 01:30:42.615]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.615 --> 01:30:43.556]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.556 --> 01:30:44.357]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.617 --> 01:30:47.681]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:30:59.958 --> 01:31:06.923]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:05.071]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.071 --> 01:32:09.597]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.597 --> 01:32:11.880]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.502]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:33:05.469 --> 01:33:08.970]  Alright, I want to go over a whole bunch of news.
[01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:10.811]  I want to play an audio clip
[01:33:11.735 --> 01:33:25.701]  From the Council on Foreign Relations, we've got clips of Al Gore being confronted because the New York Times finally reported he's making all this money off of the climate scam.
[01:33:25.701 --> 01:33:29.543]  But the New York Times says it's like, it's good, isn't it good he's making millions?
[01:33:29.543 --> 01:33:33.604]  And they only tell you about the smaller scams he's carrying out.
[01:33:33.604 --> 01:33:35.065]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[01:33:38.672 --> 01:33:44.793]  Before I do that, I just want to tell you we're going to have open phones in the next hour on any issue you wish to discuss.
[01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:45.894]  They're not open yet.
[01:33:45.894 --> 01:33:52.695]  We're going to have phone blitz next hour with some other important news.
[01:33:52.695 --> 01:33:59.697]  And then we've got Gary Franchi and William Lewis here in studio today.
[01:33:59.697 --> 01:34:03.157]  They're here to film part two of their Camp FEMA with me, so why not have them in studio?
[01:34:03.157 --> 01:34:04.378]  That should be interesting.
[01:34:04.378 --> 01:34:05.238]  Always informative.
[01:34:07.432 --> 01:34:11.054]  But I wanted to stop here for a moment and explain to people.
[01:34:11.054 --> 01:34:12.836]  There's no more denial.
[01:34:12.836 --> 01:34:14.297]  There's no more playing games.
[01:34:14.297 --> 01:34:17.059]  There's no more time to rationalize.
[01:34:17.059 --> 01:34:27.686]  Not only has world government been admitted by the big central bankers, by Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, by Al Gore, by Barack Obama, by Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Bill Gates,
[01:34:29.315 --> 01:34:32.956]  But the specifics of the world government have been admitted.
[01:34:32.956 --> 01:34:35.717]  In hundreds of textbooks, white papers, and documents.
[01:34:35.717 --> 01:34:40.379]  But not just in textbooks now, like eco-science that I talk about so much.
[01:34:40.379 --> 01:34:43.800]  Written by the White House science czar, John P. Holdren.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:51.522]  But in editorials in the New York Times, called We Can Do It, Ban Ki-moon, Global Governance, We Have the Treaty.
[01:34:51.522 --> 01:34:54.183]  I went over it yesterday, I'm gonna cover it some more today.
[01:34:54.183 --> 01:34:56.324]  They're now debating the passage in the Senate.
[01:34:59.244 --> 01:35:01.628]  That's why the Democrats haven't been pushing it the last month.
[01:35:01.628 --> 01:35:05.594]  They admitted they were going to wait and race in November to pass it, and now they're going to push it.
[01:35:07.071 --> 01:35:08.932]  Merkel, the German Chancellor, was here today.
[01:35:08.932 --> 01:35:10.272]  That's all coming up.
[01:35:10.272 --> 01:35:13.253]  Ladies and gentlemen, people aren't sophisticated.
[01:35:13.253 --> 01:35:14.594]  They don't understand.
[01:35:14.594 --> 01:35:16.355]  They don't know what's happening to them.
[01:35:16.355 --> 01:35:17.955]  They know they're getting screwed.
[01:35:17.955 --> 01:35:19.356]  They know they're getting hammered.
[01:35:19.356 --> 01:35:21.336]  They know they're getting nailed to the wall.
[01:35:21.336 --> 01:35:22.797]  They know we're in deep trouble.
[01:35:22.797 --> 01:35:24.698]  They know the economy's getting worse.
[01:35:24.698 --> 01:35:32.881]  That a jobless recovery is an Orwellian, double-speak, oxymoron.
[01:35:32.881 --> 01:35:35.502]  If 20 million Americans could see fall of the Republic,
[01:35:37.549 --> 01:35:50.218]  And then if they took action and called their congressman and went to City Hall and called the corporations that are behind all of this up on the phone and boycotted people and got active, we could turn this around.
[01:35:50.218 --> 01:35:54.441]  My films, conservatively.
[01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:58.324]  You know, it's like Mike Rivera earlier said, 90% of the phone calls to Congress.
[01:35:58.324 --> 01:36:02.707]  No, Barbara Boxer, who was pro-banker bailout, said it was 1,000 to 1 phone calls.
[01:36:05.253 --> 01:36:12.659]  Gallup poll showed 99% of people were against the banker bailout takeover of last October.
[01:36:12.659 --> 01:36:15.681]  So see, Mike said 90%.
[01:36:15.681 --> 01:36:21.545]  I tend to do the same thing too.
[01:36:21.545 --> 01:36:29.311]  I tend to lessen how bad things really are.
[01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:40.494]  But the issue is, 99% of people, when they're presented with carbon taxes and global government, don't want it.
[01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:44.676]  But we need to show them the specifics.
[01:36:44.676 --> 01:36:46.637]  Because we're settling in for a long battle.
[01:36:46.637 --> 01:36:53.360]  It's gonna be, you know, they can pass legislation to let private banks and corporations regulate and tax us.
[01:36:54.628 --> 01:36:55.488]  England's already done it.
[01:36:55.488 --> 01:37:03.252]  It was in the Times of London last week where private groups come and take your house and your car and your home for fines and fees.
[01:37:03.252 --> 01:37:05.313]  No judge, no jury.
[01:37:05.313 --> 01:37:09.915]  We can stop these people if you will take action.
[01:37:09.915 --> 01:37:15.898]  And I have the film
[01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:22.649]  They can do this.
[01:37:22.649 --> 01:37:32.153]  This is the film with their own statements, their own admissions of how they want world government, how they're going to control your life, how they plan on doing it, all the horrible things they want to carry out.
[01:37:32.153 --> 01:37:38.096]  These are very wicked control freaks with an instinct towards domination and control.
[01:37:38.096 --> 01:37:41.858]  And so my films have been seen by more than 100 million people.
[01:37:41.858 --> 01:37:44.919]  And that's a conservative number.
[01:37:44.919 --> 01:37:49.641]  Just like Mike's 90% when it was 99% in the news were against the banker bailout.
[01:37:51.670 --> 01:37:52.971]  Over 100 million times.
[01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:59.396]  So we're making a major contribution here towards awakening people.
[01:37:59.396 --> 01:38:02.138]  But it's not enough.
[01:38:02.138 --> 01:38:05.901]  We need all of you that are awake to do more and to get involved.
[01:38:05.901 --> 01:38:08.523]  And I've never made a film this powerful.
[01:38:08.523 --> 01:38:15.007]  Over 20 million views on YouTube and Google alone for The Obama Deception.
[01:38:15.007 --> 01:38:18.190]  Over 100 million views we know of for my films free online.
[01:38:20.054 --> 01:38:24.196]  It is incalculable what people have done with the DVDs making copies.
[01:38:27.538 --> 01:38:28.578]  Make history!
[01:38:28.578 --> 01:38:29.759]  Hurt these people!
[01:38:29.759 --> 01:38:30.879]  Fight back!
[01:38:30.879 --> 01:38:41.183]  Know that it's going to be a delayed reaction, but that when you burn copies of the Obama deception and endgame and fall the Republic, the fall of the Republic is what's happening now.
[01:38:41.183 --> 01:38:43.704]  This was made for the fight we're now facing.
[01:38:43.704 --> 01:38:45.084]  It shows everything.
[01:38:45.084 --> 01:38:50.246]  And people see it now and then see what I'm talking about on the news, but this gives them all the answers.
[01:38:52.361 --> 01:38:55.784]  I want to ask you right now to call the toll-free number and order this DVD.
[01:38:55.784 --> 01:38:58.807]  I want to ask you to go to InfoWars and order this DVD.
[01:38:58.807 --> 01:39:12.661]  And to get it, and to buy a DVD burner and a bunch of DVD blanks, and to make copies, and to give it to your neighbors and say this is a dynamic, important film about global taxes and what's happening, and about the death of the dollar, and about the private banks and how they engineered the crisis.
[01:39:12.661 --> 01:39:14.563]  You can even give them the big McClatchy
[01:39:15.243 --> 01:39:26.172]  Article by an award-winning reporter with the documents from inside Goldman Sachs how they engineered the banking collapse to consolidate power.
[01:39:26.172 --> 01:39:35.239]  The top technicians of the private banks nest inside Goldman Sachs, the brokerage firm.
[01:39:35.239 --> 01:39:39.403]  We have all these top professors, all the experts in here laying it out.
[01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:41.952]  This film is so important.
[01:39:41.952 --> 01:39:44.874]  I cannot stress to you how important.
[01:39:44.874 --> 01:39:46.836]  Please be part of history.
[01:39:46.836 --> 01:39:50.019]  Order the DVD at 888-253-3139.
[01:39:50.019 --> 01:39:50.659]  888-253-3139.
[01:39:50.659 --> 01:39:55.343]  Go to Infowars.com and order it.
[01:39:55.343 --> 01:39:55.984]  Make copies.
[01:39:55.984 --> 01:39:57.125]  Get it out to people.
[01:39:57.125 --> 01:40:00.828]  This is the cure to the New World Order.
[01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.950]  This is an amazing film.
[01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:04.231]  This explains it all.
[01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.173]  This is a testament to our enemies.
[01:40:10.339 --> 01:40:12.320]  The Russians were trained to submit to government.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.561]  They didn't fight Lenin and Stalin.
[01:40:14.561 --> 01:40:16.362]  The Germans were trained to submit to government.
[01:40:16.362 --> 01:40:18.043]  Americans haven't been like that.
[01:40:18.043 --> 01:40:28.208]  Though we have been buffaloed and broke back and trained to capitulate in the last few decades, we can awaken that American spirit again with this documentary film.
[01:40:29.048 --> 01:40:30.489]  If you will make it great.
[01:40:30.489 --> 01:40:31.409]  If you will make it huge.
[01:40:31.409 --> 01:40:34.491]  Yeah, it's been seen millions of times already in a week and a half online.
[01:40:34.491 --> 01:40:37.672]  Yeah, massive downloads at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:40:37.672 --> 01:40:40.153]  Yes, reports of folks making copies of it everywhere.
[01:40:40.153 --> 01:40:41.394]  That isn't enough.
[01:40:41.394 --> 01:40:43.295]  I don't want you to double your previous efforts.
[01:40:43.295 --> 01:40:44.656]  I don't want you to triple them.
[01:40:44.656 --> 01:40:46.577]  I don't want you to quadruple them.
[01:40:46.577 --> 01:40:57.522]  I want you to do whatever it takes to get this film and to get it out to everyone and air it on AXS TV and to give it to your city council and to give it to leaders in your area.
[01:40:59.232 --> 01:41:17.384]  I'm not gonna name names because people that order the films are private, but we've had a lot of high-powered, famous people and groups and corporations and the Pentagon and foreign governments order Follow the Republic, Endgame, and the Obama Deception.
[01:41:17.384 --> 01:41:22.448]  Very famous name, and we checked the credit card and everything, and that's who ordered it.
[01:41:22.448 --> 01:41:26.290]  Very famous person.
[01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:27.331]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[01:41:28.743 --> 01:41:31.084]  Ordered the film yesterday.
[01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:31.704]  Actually, Sunday.
[01:41:31.704 --> 01:41:34.384]  I saw the order yesterday.
[01:41:34.384 --> 01:41:36.325]  So the good news is you're getting the word out.
[01:41:36.325 --> 01:41:42.446]  And if you can't buy the film, it's free on YouTube!
[01:41:42.446 --> 01:41:43.306]  Change the channel.
[01:41:43.306 --> 01:41:44.246]  It's a director channel.
[01:41:44.246 --> 01:41:46.087]  It's not our channel.
[01:41:46.087 --> 01:41:50.408]  He's one of the few YouTube channels that doesn't put their own ads all over the front of it.
[01:41:50.408 --> 01:41:52.468]  I got to do something about that because it ruins the film.
[01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:58.738]  We need to make Change the Channel the most viewed free copy on YouTube.
[01:41:58.738 --> 01:42:00.900]  It is free.
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:01.600]  A $200,000 film.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.163]  And it isn't the money that matters to me.
[01:42:05.163 --> 01:42:08.385]  It's that I busted my butt and so did my crew making this film.
[01:42:08.385 --> 01:42:16.191]  I mean, we literally hurt ourselves not sleeping and working with a small crew to make this.
[01:42:16.191 --> 01:42:17.712]  And I just want it to be seen.
[01:42:17.712 --> 01:42:19.794]  I just want people to come out of darkness.
[01:42:19.794 --> 01:42:22.516]  I don't want people to be conned, to be bamboozled, to be scammed.
[01:42:23.894 --> 01:42:31.798]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, 888-253-3139.
[01:42:31.798 --> 01:42:33.458]  Write to me, P.O.
[01:42:33.458 --> 01:42:36.159]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:42:36.159 --> 01:42:37.780]  P.O.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.741]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:42:40.741 --> 01:42:42.462]  I don't want your donations.
[01:42:42.462 --> 01:42:44.483]  If you want to donate to us, buy a hundred copies.
[01:42:44.483 --> 01:42:47.324]  You can get them more than half price for that.
[01:42:47.324 --> 01:42:47.985]  You got the money?
[01:42:47.985 --> 01:42:49.365]  Buy the original, give it to people.
[01:42:49.365 --> 01:42:51.006]  They'll watch it with this eye candy on it.
[01:42:54.406 --> 01:42:58.428]  But it's free on YouTube!
[01:42:58.428 --> 01:43:00.250]  Free!
[01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.550]  And it's decent quality.
[01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:06.093]  It's not like PrisonPlanet.tv or the DVD.
[01:43:06.093 --> 01:43:09.575]  You know, sure, I can watch any movie I want free online, ripped.
[01:43:09.575 --> 01:43:13.978]  But, you know, when I want to watch a movie, I go buy the DVD so it's higher quality and so I support the artist.
[01:43:13.978 --> 01:43:15.539]  But that isn't what matters to me.
[01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:20.191]  We're going to be able to make future films.
[01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:23.872]  We've got enough capital to do that, thanks to your support and God's graces.
[01:43:23.872 --> 01:43:35.398]  But don't pearls before swine that I made a $200,000 film and lay it out there for you for free!
[01:43:35.398 --> 01:43:37.339]  Spread the free link with everybody.
[01:43:37.339 --> 01:43:40.400]  Take it for what it's worth, a precious creation of truth.
[01:43:42.011 --> 01:43:43.372]  I'm gonna shut up about it, alright?
[01:43:43.372 --> 01:43:44.572]  Just follow the Republic.
[01:43:44.572 --> 01:43:45.553]  Follow the Republic.
[01:43:45.553 --> 01:43:46.733]  Follow the Republic.
[01:43:46.733 --> 01:43:48.134]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:43:48.134 --> 01:43:50.495]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[01:43:50.495 --> 01:43:51.896]  Don't stop.
[01:43:51.896 --> 01:43:54.637]  This thing is damaging to the globalists.
[01:43:54.637 --> 01:43:56.198]  And if somebody's laughing at you, move on.
[01:43:56.198 --> 01:43:57.658]  Find people that care.
[01:43:57.658 --> 01:43:58.799]  Find decision makers.
[01:44:02.435 --> 01:44:04.876]  The second most important film, Endgame.
[01:44:04.876 --> 01:44:07.018]  You want to know their master plan, who they are?
[01:44:07.018 --> 01:44:13.201]  I lay out the carbon tax, the global government, how they're going to implode the economy by design to bring in the global government.
[01:44:13.201 --> 01:44:17.784]  Three years ago in Endgame.
[01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.385]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:44:19.385 --> 01:44:20.505]  What's it say on the back?
[01:44:20.505 --> 01:44:23.047]  They want you dead.
[01:44:23.047 --> 01:44:25.348]  That's what their own documents say.
[01:44:25.348 --> 01:44:27.790]  Just like Goldfinger, do you expect me to talk?
[01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:29.671]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:45.522]  You know, I could just play these clips, and I didn't have time last night to go find the actual CFR blog.
[01:44:45.522 --> 01:44:48.343]  I did go to the site and find the blog, but then we had to register.
[01:44:48.343 --> 01:45:01.065]  The point is, here is the audio from the Council on Foreign Relations, where they talk about artificial scarcity, how they're going to create artificial
[01:45:03.817 --> 01:45:16.142]  Scarcity and how they want to say that there aren't enough vaccines so everybody lines up to create a stampede, a perceived demand for it.
[01:45:16.142 --> 01:45:18.223]  This was a month ago this aired.
[01:45:18.223 --> 01:45:23.485]  The person that put this video together put some clips of the news, fear-mongering in between it, and put some text.
[01:45:23.485 --> 01:45:26.526]  I'll be reading on air for radio listeners, TV listeners can watch it.
[01:45:27.793 --> 01:45:30.856]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:45:30.856 --> 01:45:34.939]  CFR vaccines, no more harmful than tuna sandwich.
[01:45:34.939 --> 01:45:38.382]  They're admitting there's mercury in it.
[01:45:38.382 --> 01:45:46.850]  But the other issue here is yes, mercury in a tuna sandwich though is bound to the protein and 99 plus percent of it goes through your body.
[01:45:49.249 --> 01:45:57.195]  It's not injected into your blood, bound with the virus, so there's an autoimmune response that the mercury accelerates as an adjuvant.
[01:45:57.195 --> 01:45:59.477]  And we've had medical doctors on to explain it.
[01:45:59.477 --> 01:46:02.479]  But listen to how they arrogantly laugh at you.
[01:46:02.479 --> 01:46:03.940]  Listen to how they joke.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:14.508]  Listen to how one of the medical directors, and these are high-level government and university heads, and the CFR, laughs and says, we should make it where there's not enough of it, so they stampede to get it.
[01:46:14.508 --> 01:46:15.869]  Now you see them doing that.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:22.243]  And we told you they were doing that months ago.
[01:46:22.243 --> 01:46:23.704]  This is how they manipulate you.
[01:46:23.704 --> 01:46:27.546]  Let's go ahead and go to the video.
[01:46:27.546 --> 01:46:31.088]  Anatomy of the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
[01:46:31.088 --> 01:46:34.670]  Thank you for downloading this Council on Foreign Relations podcast.
[01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:40.013]  CFR is an independent national membership organization and nonpartisan research center.
[01:46:40.762 --> 01:46:41.963]  Good morning.
[01:46:41.963 --> 01:46:47.026]  My name is Lori Garrett and you are here in the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
[01:46:47.026 --> 01:46:52.530]  I am the Senior Fellow for Global Health here at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:46:52.530 --> 01:47:05.019]  With us today is a stellar group of scientists, analysts, journalists, and as usual at the Council on Foreign Relations, a highly diverse and intelligent audience.
[01:47:05.019 --> 01:47:08.822]  At the heart of the discussion was how to get American public to take the unpopular H1N1 vaccines.
[01:47:13.257 --> 01:47:15.098]  John Moore from Cornell Medical School.
[01:47:15.098 --> 01:47:27.423]  So I think we're all aware that the anti-vaccine movement is having a field day on the internet and on media outlets like Fox News and so on, causing reductions in vaccine uptake.
[01:47:27.423 --> 01:47:31.105]  And it appears to be... Back it up a bit.
[01:47:31.105 --> 01:47:35.027]  That's one of the Cornell Medical University people.
[01:47:35.027 --> 01:47:35.947]  And then we've got them all listed.
[01:47:35.947 --> 01:47:38.628]  These are all high-level government and university heads.
[01:47:38.628 --> 01:47:39.949]  We've got their names listed in the article.
[01:47:41.852 --> 01:47:46.034]  But again, the issue here is a field day.
[01:47:46.034 --> 01:47:48.035]  Then they call us crazy and all this.
[01:47:48.035 --> 01:48:01.662]  When it's admitted it's killing people, maiming people, it's admitted it can cause brain damage, it's admitted it's doing that, it's admitted it has mercury in it, and it's admitted that over 70% of Americans in polls are now refusing it.
[01:48:01.662 --> 01:48:03.523]  See, they're losing!
[01:48:03.523 --> 01:48:05.363]  So now they talk about how to lie to us.
[01:48:05.363 --> 01:48:09.906]  Back to it.
[01:48:09.906 --> 01:48:10.286]  Here it is.
[01:48:11.684 --> 01:48:13.525]  John Moore from Cornell Medical School.
[01:48:13.525 --> 01:48:25.854]  So I think we're all aware that the anti-vaccine movement is having a field day on the internet and on media outlets like Fox News and so on, causing reductions in vaccine uptake.
[01:48:25.854 --> 01:48:32.759]  And it appears to be a pretty unholy alliance of the ultra-right and the ultra-left working together in a sort of Hitler-style impact.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.921]  It's not a Hitler-Stalin.
[01:48:36.921 --> 01:48:39.382]  No, that's your masters that funded that, the big banks.
[01:48:39.382 --> 01:48:41.103]  That's declassified.
[01:48:41.103 --> 01:48:46.667]  No, we're people who don't want you setting the precedent to forcibly inoculate us.
[01:48:46.667 --> 01:48:51.869]  And they say in the tape, we want forced inoculation.
[01:48:51.869 --> 01:48:55.651]  See, we don't like your medical tyranny, you little control freaks.
[01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:58.053]  You arrogant bastards who enjoy lying to people.
[01:48:59.329 --> 01:49:02.653]  For years saying there was no mercury in it when you knew full well there was.
[01:49:02.653 --> 01:49:04.154]  You've lost credibility.
[01:49:04.154 --> 01:49:13.245]  So now top actors, top lawyers, top politicians, even Robert Kennedy Jr., all these, even Bill Maher's come out against it.
[01:49:13.245 --> 01:49:15.247]  Even the head of Smashing Pumpkins has come out.
[01:49:15.247 --> 01:49:16.128]  Everybody's coming out.
[01:49:16.368 --> 01:49:17.269]  We're tired of you!
[01:49:17.269 --> 01:49:18.530]  We're not left and right!
[01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:19.812]  We're not in your box!
[01:49:19.812 --> 01:49:21.694]  We don't buy your lies anymore!
[01:49:21.694 --> 01:49:23.175]  You got it, you little bastard?
[01:49:23.175 --> 01:49:25.137]  You little eugenicist control freak?
[01:49:25.137 --> 01:49:27.940]  Where they talk about putting stuff in our vaccines to sterilize us?
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.502]  The White House science czar does?
[01:49:29.502 --> 01:49:31.865]  We know how to read, you son of a bitch!
[01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:32.706]  Excuse me.
[01:49:32.706 --> 01:49:33.647]  Back to that bastard.
[01:49:35.166 --> 01:49:39.231]  I'm not sure that we're countering these people very well.
[01:49:39.231 --> 01:49:43.756]  And you have to take these people on in a different style than scientists are used to.
[01:49:43.756 --> 01:49:46.118]  We have to develop better soundbites.
[01:49:46.118 --> 01:49:49.162]  We have to develop better discussion.
[01:49:49.162 --> 01:49:53.606]  You can't really debate these people, but you have to develop better countermeasures.
[01:49:54.741 --> 01:49:59.302]  You can't really debate these people because we actually read the vaccine inserts.
[01:49:59.302 --> 01:50:20.727]  You can't really debate these people because, what, we probably had 20, 25 medical doctors, top brain surgeons that developed some of the most commonly used brain surgeries, scientists who discovered excitotoxins now in all the medical dictionaries, all these top virologists, all these top genetic engineers who aren't scumbags like you.
[01:50:21.687 --> 01:50:26.993]  Like the majority of German doctors and British doctors who won't give it now and who won't take it?
[01:50:26.993 --> 01:50:32.779]  You mean like the German government, the German military that have special clean vaccines for themselves?
[01:50:32.779 --> 01:50:35.381]  You mean like, you mean your cover-ups imploding?
[01:50:35.381 --> 01:50:42.248]  Just like your global carbon tax, just like your open borders, just like your victim disarmament, just like your private central banks.
[01:50:42.248 --> 01:50:44.490]  Everybody's learning about the private Federal Reserve now.
[01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:52.458]  Everybody's identifying you, the criminal ruling class, that are a bunch of con artist, control freak, eugenicists.
[01:50:52.458 --> 01:50:54.840]  Listen, you little Hitler bastards.
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.702]  Your field day is over.
[01:50:56.702 --> 01:50:59.625]  Us laying down and taking it is over!
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.243]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[01:51:06.243 --> 01:51:08.525]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[01:51:08.525 --> 01:51:12.648]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[01:51:12.648 --> 01:51:19.334]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[01:51:19.334 --> 01:51:23.217]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[01:51:23.217 --> 01:51:27.161]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:29.844]  Neutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct.
[01:51:29.844 --> 01:51:31.185]  Your new comfort food.
[01:51:31.185 --> 01:51:34.289]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare, and a long shelf life.
[01:51:34.289 --> 01:51:35.530]  Neutroversal Foods.
[01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:42.258]  More fun while hunting and fishing, bigger tails around the campfire, and the food your kids will want when celebrating the win of a ballgame.
[01:51:42.258 --> 01:51:46.723]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.
[01:51:47.123 --> 01:51:50.585]  New Traversal Foods by eFoodsDirect, your new comfort food.
[01:51:50.585 --> 01:51:53.467]  eFoodsDirect.com 1-800-409-5633.

[01:51:58.730 --> 01:52:06.234]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:52:06.234 --> 01:52:11.877]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[01:52:11.877 --> 01:52:12.957]  The answer is simple.
[01:52:16.954 --> 01:52:17.774]  We're good to go!
[01:52:45.839 --> 01:52:46.279]  We're good.
[01:53:00.908 --> 01:53:02.209]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:07.794]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.794 --> 01:53:12.819]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:18.404]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:18.404 --> 01:53:23.088]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.615 --> 01:53:30.717]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.717 --> 01:53:31.837]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:31.837 --> 01:53:38.519]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.519 --> 01:53:41.720]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.861]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:49.863 --> 01:53:52.746]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:52.746 --> 01:53:57.570]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.570 --> 01:54:06.578]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:06.578 --> 01:54:09.341]  I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion.
[01:54:09.341 --> 01:54:14.245]  Gonna chase the sky forever.
[01:54:18.001 --> 01:54:19.161]  And we're gonna ride
[01:54:43.691 --> 01:54:46.593]  Gotta love Johnny Cash.
[01:54:46.593 --> 01:54:51.776]  Gotta love Willie Nelson.
[01:54:51.776 --> 01:54:52.416]  Oh, man.
[01:55:09.406 --> 01:55:19.169]  All right, going back to the CFR, all these big government heads, university heads, they're up there deciding how to counter the public who won't take their shots because we can read the inserts.
[01:55:19.169 --> 01:55:20.009]  Let's go back to it.
[01:55:20.009 --> 01:55:24.430]  And then it goes into some spaces where they show the news media hyping the fear.
[01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.770]  Here it is.
[01:55:27.904 --> 01:55:31.828]  We shouldn't take flu vaccines because the mercury will kill us.
[01:55:31.828 --> 01:55:40.777]  Well, Paul Offit in the New York Times last week pointed out that there is less mercury in a flu shot than there is in a tuna fish sandwich.
[01:55:40.777 --> 01:55:45.983]  And that's a powerful soundbite to use against the crazy people.
[01:55:47.244 --> 01:55:49.126]  Crazy people when their kids are brain damaged.
[01:55:49.126 --> 01:55:50.127]  Here are the crazy people.
[01:55:50.127 --> 01:55:52.088]  Oh, he took it and he got sick.
[01:55:52.088 --> 01:55:52.469]  Hit pause.
[01:55:52.469 --> 01:55:54.871]  Back it up to that local New York news clip of the supposed crazy people.
[01:55:54.871 --> 01:55:57.933]  See, everybody I know won't take it because most of them had a kid drop...
[01:56:12.506 --> 01:56:16.048]  On the ground convulsing, or they got deathly sick from it.
[01:56:16.048 --> 01:56:17.009]  Oh, but you're crazy!
[01:56:17.009 --> 01:56:20.151]  You take a shot and it almost kills you!
[01:56:20.151 --> 01:56:24.153]  Like Dale Dudley, the local 93.7 Morning Show host.
[01:56:24.153 --> 01:56:27.054]  His whole body got paralyzed for a few weeks.
[01:56:27.054 --> 01:56:29.996]  He still doesn't have feeling in some of his toes.
[01:56:29.996 --> 01:56:31.297]  Is he a crazy person?
[01:56:31.297 --> 01:56:32.398]  He believed you!
[01:56:32.398 --> 01:56:35.900]  He went and took your shot!
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:37.841]  Oh, he's bad.
[01:56:37.841 --> 01:56:41.583]  Let's go to the crazy people in New York, explaining why they don't take it.
[01:56:43.499 --> 01:56:45.800]  Are you getting the swine flu vaccine?
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:46.541]  Uh, no.
[01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:47.681]  I got the Superman gene.
[01:56:47.681 --> 01:56:48.702]  I never get sick.
[01:56:48.702 --> 01:56:51.664]  The only time I took a flu vaccination, it made me sick.
[01:56:51.664 --> 01:56:53.024]  And I don't want to get like that no more.
[01:56:53.024 --> 01:56:54.345]  So I'll take my chances.
[01:56:54.345 --> 01:56:56.946]  No one is really stating the risk behind it.
[01:56:56.946 --> 01:57:00.008]  So, I'm not gonna be a guinea pig for anyone.
[01:57:00.008 --> 01:57:01.269]  So, I'm not getting it.
[01:57:01.269 --> 01:57:07.372]  We don't know how the vaccination has been done.
[01:57:07.372 --> 01:57:10.134]  Is the vaccination scarier than the flu?
[01:57:10.134 --> 01:57:10.334]  Yes.
[01:57:10.994 --> 01:57:13.297]  I feel like we got a little crazy with this.
[01:57:13.297 --> 01:57:14.519]  Why did we get crazy with this?
[01:57:14.519 --> 01:57:18.024]  Uh, I think the media hypes up stuff.
[01:57:18.024 --> 01:57:23.231]  You know, and this, everything takes on these epic proportions, so... Deal with the crazy people.
[01:57:27.857 --> 01:57:33.221]  As to who's to blame for all the hype, everyone seems to agree that's the mainstream media's fault.
[01:57:33.221 --> 01:57:37.464]  The president now declaring the H1N1 outbreak a national emergency.
[01:57:37.464 --> 01:57:40.406]  The White House says the president signed this proclamation last night.
[01:57:40.406 --> 01:57:44.990]  It will allow medical officials to bypass certain federal requirements.
[01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:49.173]  Some officials describe this move as being similar to a declaration ahead of a hurricane.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:54.701]  But that wasn't the story we were getting from President just a few weeks ago.
[01:57:54.701 --> 01:58:03.783]  I said when we saw the first cases of this virus back in the spring, I don't want anybody to be alarmed, but I do want everybody to be prepared.
[01:58:03.783 --> 01:58:07.204]  Now back to the Council on Foreign Relations Symposium.
[01:58:07.204 --> 01:58:13.526]  Despite being a not terribly dangerous virus in and of itself on a scale of influenza dangers,
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:27.187]  Having said that, it lacks certain signatures, certain molecular signs, which are associated with the 1918 pandemic strain, the 1957, and the... Hit pause.
[01:58:27.187 --> 01:58:31.350]  There they are, admitting it's not even really dangerous.
[01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:38.794]  Now they come back, and they talk about how they need to lie to the public, and they giggle and snicker and enjoy their evil.
[01:58:42.972 --> 01:58:45.459]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.459 --> 01:58:47.785]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.387 --> 01:58:59.552]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.552 --> 01:59:02.914]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:02.914 --> 01:59:08.777]  Instead, use Vitamin C-D and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:08.777 --> 01:59:13.560]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:15.921]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:59:16.181 --> 01:59:16.561]  I'm good.
[01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:33.230]  We're good to go.
[02:00:05.273 --> 02:00:10.100]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:11.682]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.682 --> 02:00:12.604]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.604 --> 02:00:17.431]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.431 --> 02:00:21.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.541 --> 02:00:27.544]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, halfway into this transmission today.
[02:00:27.544 --> 02:00:31.367]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment on any issue you'd like to discuss.
[02:00:31.367 --> 02:00:33.928]  The global cap and trade now in the Senate.
[02:00:33.928 --> 02:00:36.891]  They're set to vote on it in the next few days, next few weeks.
[02:00:36.891 --> 02:00:38.572]  God only knows what these demons are going to do.
[02:00:38.572 --> 02:00:38.652]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:38.652 --> 02:00:40.833]  Al Gore bragging how much money he's making off all the scams.
[02:00:40.833 --> 02:00:40.893]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:48.593 --> 02:00:51.815]  259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[02:00:51.815 --> 02:00:53.836]  A bunch of other financial news.
[02:00:53.836 --> 02:00:57.639]  But right now I'm playing CFR Audio Blog.
[02:00:57.639 --> 02:01:02.361]  They publicly put this out interspersed with clips of their fairmongering.
[02:01:02.361 --> 02:01:07.004]  Now this was recorded a little less than a month ago.
[02:01:07.004 --> 02:01:08.185]  Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:01:08.185 --> 02:01:17.851]  We've got the names of the federal government and hospital and university heads talking about how they need to use soundbites and how crazy people are getting folks to not take it.
[02:01:19.259 --> 02:01:26.765]  And then they get into, we need to act like there's not enough of it to create the perception, artificial scarcity.
[02:01:26.765 --> 02:01:30.748]  And there's all this giggling and snickering on the conference call.
[02:01:30.748 --> 02:01:41.016]  It's so much fun to manipulate and feel powerful in your little white lab coat and work for the government and to feed their kids fluoride water and eat GMO too.
[02:01:41.016 --> 02:01:43.338]  They love it.
[02:01:43.338 --> 02:01:44.559]  This is your enemy.
[02:01:44.559 --> 02:01:45.320]  Let's go back to them.
[02:01:48.306 --> 02:01:55.631]  It's a short one, it has a technical name, PB1F2, and that is missing in the 2009 virus.
[02:01:55.631 --> 02:02:05.797]  We're also making steady progress on developing a safe and effective H1N1 flu vaccine, and we expect a flu shot program will begin soon.
[02:02:05.797 --> 02:02:08.579]  This program will be completely voluntary.
[02:02:08.579 --> 02:02:10.080]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.601]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:11.601 --> 02:02:13.102]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:13.102 --> 02:02:14.203]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:14.602 --> 02:02:16.002]  Good morning, Rory Lantzman.
[02:02:16.002 --> 02:02:18.343]  I'm a member of the New York State Assembly.
[02:02:18.343 --> 02:02:31.986]  We had a hearing, a 12-hour hearing on H1N1 earlier this week, and much of it focused on the mandatory vaccination that the New York State Department of Health has ordered of almost all health care workers in New York State.
[02:02:31.986 --> 02:02:41.269]  And I was wondering if you could offer an opinion on whether you think such a policy is effective and sound.
[02:02:41.269 --> 02:02:42.369]  I have a very strong opinion.
[02:02:43.752 --> 02:02:45.893]  And that is, I think that's appropriate.
[02:02:45.893 --> 02:02:47.394]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:47.394 --> 02:02:48.935]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:48.935 --> 02:02:50.436]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:50.436 --> 02:02:51.496]  Completely voluntary.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:55.761]  Now see, that's how they operate.
[02:02:55.761 --> 02:02:59.501]  Obama comes out and says, I don't think it's racist to criticize me.
[02:02:59.501 --> 02:03:01.222]  All of his surrogates say it.
[02:03:01.222 --> 02:03:02.582]  He gets to play the good cop.
[02:03:02.582 --> 02:03:04.283]  They play the bad cop.
[02:03:04.283 --> 02:03:05.663]  They come out all over the country.
[02:03:05.663 --> 02:03:08.144]  The feds try to force it to the states.
[02:03:08.144 --> 02:03:10.124]  Their own manuals say it.
[02:03:10.124 --> 02:03:12.805]  And then Obama's like, I'm not making anybody.
[02:03:12.805 --> 02:03:14.305]  He's the good guy.
[02:03:14.305 --> 02:03:15.906]  Back to the tape.
[02:03:15.906 --> 02:03:17.406]  Completely voluntary.
[02:03:17.406 --> 02:03:18.946]  Completely voluntary.
[02:03:18.946 --> 02:03:20.447]  Completely voluntary.
[02:03:20.447 --> 02:03:21.527]  Completely voluntary.
[02:03:22.099 --> 02:03:31.347]  The news media is hyping the swine flu as though it's the next death mission, and everybody's getting frightened.
[02:03:31.347 --> 02:03:33.149]  Do you agree with that?
[02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:34.270]  No, I don't.
[02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:44.099]  From what I've seen, certainly some vulnerable people have died, but not masses of people like the Black Plague or anything.
[02:03:44.099 --> 02:03:48.443]  The truth is that many Americans are not buying into the swine flu scam and refusing the vaccine.
[02:03:50.666 --> 02:03:57.148]  However, there are those who are buying into the scam and do intend to vaccinate themselves and their families.
[02:03:57.148 --> 02:04:00.608]  But there are those who are on the fence about the vaccine.
[02:04:00.608 --> 02:04:07.510]  And what do the experts recommend to get them to take the flu shot?
[02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:15.412]  I think what would work better would be to say that there was a shortage and people tend to line up more for something that they demand.
[02:04:15.412 --> 02:04:18.973]  We saw that there was one season where really people lined up all night to get a flu shot.
[02:04:22.392 --> 02:04:26.737]  ABC News puts the H1N1 vaccine artificial scarcity tactic to the test.
[02:04:26.737 --> 02:04:32.502]  And with supplies of the vaccine running low, doctors around the country are now finding themselves overrun with nervous parents.
[02:04:32.502 --> 02:04:33.804]  Here's ABC's Rachel Martin.
[02:04:35.131 --> 02:04:41.915]  For weeks, doctors' offices around the country have been fielding a flurry of phone calls.
[02:04:41.915 --> 02:04:44.236]  Alright, stop it right there.
[02:04:44.236 --> 02:04:50.460]  Let's back it up to the CFR saying we need to create artificial scarcity, act like there's not enough.
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.861]  Then ABC News puts it to the test.
[02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:55.182]  I told you months ago this was the game plan.
[02:04:55.182 --> 02:04:57.544]  I know our enemy, and I'm gonna get him.
[02:05:00.478 --> 02:05:03.859]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.859 --> 02:05:07.460]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:12.042]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.042 --> 02:05:17.644]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:17.924 --> 02:05:22.705]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.705 --> 02:05:26.326]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.326 --> 02:05:31.147]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.147 --> 02:05:37.708]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.708 --> 02:05:39.649]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:43.350]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:47.831]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.831 --> 02:05:50.052]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.052 --> 02:05:50.372]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.372 --> 02:05:51.132]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.069 --> 02:06:04.071]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.071 --> 02:06:09.415]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.415 --> 02:06:11.456]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.456 --> 02:06:16.459]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.459 --> 02:06:17.640]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:18.761]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.761 --> 02:06:20.642]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.642 --> 02:06:21.723]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.723 --> 02:06:23.924]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.924 --> 02:06:25.265]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.265 --> 02:06:26.786]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.786 --> 02:06:27.847]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:06:27.987 --> 02:06:29.329]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:06:29.329 --> 02:06:32.051]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:35.635]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.635 --> 02:06:39.459]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.459 --> 02:06:40.681]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.681 --> 02:06:41.582]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.582 --> 02:06:42.683]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.683 --> 02:06:43.624]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.624 --> 02:06:44.445]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.705 --> 02:06:47.746]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.746 --> 02:06:49.527]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.527 --> 02:06:50.447]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:05.327]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.327 --> 02:07:09.853]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:09.853 --> 02:07:12.136]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.136 --> 02:07:13.758]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:13.758 --> 02:07:14.800]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:23.442]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.442 --> 02:07:30.904]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:30.904 --> 02:07:36.946]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[02:07:36.946 --> 02:07:42.507]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:42.947 --> 02:07:47.090]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:47.090 --> 02:07:53.315]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[02:07:53.315 --> 02:07:54.556]  866-762-9238.
[02:07:54.556 --> 02:07:57.879]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:02.685 --> 02:08:09.330]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.330 --> 02:08:13.513]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.513 --> 02:08:17.936]  I'm gonna be honest with the listeners.
[02:08:17.936 --> 02:08:23.680]  I haven't been able to sleep as much as I could in the past, and I thought it was coffee.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:30.225]  So I've cut my coffee intake from four cups a day, which I space out so I can work 16 hours a day some days,
[02:08:31.075 --> 02:08:34.918]  to one cup in the morning, maybe one in the afternoon.
[02:08:34.918 --> 02:08:39.622]  So I've cut my coffee by more than half because instead of big cups, I'm having little cups.
[02:08:40.643 --> 02:08:43.524]  And I'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking about the carbon tax.
[02:08:43.524 --> 02:08:51.207]  I'm waking up at 3 a.m., worried about the New World Order, worried about how they're going to stage a new terror attack.
[02:08:51.207 --> 02:08:54.868]  I mean, this is real, not just intellectually studying it.
[02:08:54.868 --> 02:08:58.550]  When I get up here and yell and scream and get mad, I apologize for that.
[02:08:58.550 --> 02:09:01.811]  But at the same time, maybe I shouldn't apologize.
[02:09:01.811 --> 02:09:03.912]  We need to be upset about what's happening.
[02:09:05.993 --> 02:09:13.377]  I've read hundreds of CFR publications where they admitted 30 plus years ago they were going to set up a North American Union by stealth.
[02:09:13.377 --> 02:09:14.018]  That's a quote.
[02:09:15.401 --> 02:09:32.468]  And where they admitted they were going to bankrupt the banks and the economy to bring in the one world government and the carbon tax and a one-child policy and how they're going to tax everything we do and control our lives and how they'd militarize the police and train them to use rubber bullets and tasers on us before they train them to actually shoot us.
[02:09:32.468 --> 02:09:36.889]  And now police departments all over are announcing if you run, they're going to shoot you in the back.
[02:09:36.889 --> 02:09:40.951]  And they are shooting people in the back and killing people and covering it up.
[02:09:40.951 --> 02:09:42.631]  And I don't want to hate the police.
[02:09:42.631 --> 02:09:43.532]  What are you doing?
[02:09:44.346 --> 02:09:46.608]  You're becoming Nazis!
[02:09:46.608 --> 02:09:48.309]  The system is out of control!
[02:09:48.309 --> 02:10:05.944]  And then I see this CFR audio that this video director's cut in with news clips, where they're saying, okay, most people aren't taking the shot, because of what's on the insert, and then they admit it isn't really bad, that H1N1 isn't really a very dangerous flu virus, it's very weak.
[02:10:05.944 --> 02:10:06.784]  Well, how do we do it?
[02:10:06.784 --> 02:10:11.208]  Well, we say there isn't enough to create artificial scarcity in a panic to get it.
[02:10:12.605 --> 02:10:13.986]  And that's what they do everywhere.
[02:10:13.986 --> 02:10:26.417]  Folks, I remember in January having on the air reporters and city managers and emergency managers in Illinois, Indiana, New York State, Arizona,
[02:10:27.958 --> 02:10:42.137]  And getting the documents from the state, secret, saying get ready for millions dead, get ready for mass graves, get ready for the militia to attack your police department, get ready for the veterans to attack you with bombs.
[02:10:42.137 --> 02:10:45.382]  Then I got the Homeland Security and my reports saying it.
[02:10:47.552 --> 02:10:55.395]  Admitting homeland securities for good Americans, good people, who were against the foreign bank takeover.
[02:10:55.395 --> 02:11:10.980]  And then telling police, you're gonna do a homeland security drill for terrorists attacking your tiny police department, and we're gonna do a drill where you come to the airport and we deliver you the flu vaccine and the militias try to steal it.
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:14.501]  A role-playing scenario to demonize militias.
[02:11:16.158 --> 02:11:23.300]  This was in January, so I got on air in January and March and I said, they're going to stage some type of big flu deal.
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:27.761]  And I posted the audio of that months after it happened.
[02:11:27.761 --> 02:11:31.703]  It was live, but then we reposted it and said, look, I was right.
[02:11:31.703 --> 02:11:33.843]  I'm not that smart.
[02:11:33.843 --> 02:11:36.184]  I knew they were going to artificially
[02:11:37.287 --> 02:11:52.774]  Back in April, they delivered the seasonal flu with armed guards in Austin to the hospitals and had police parked around the clock out front the hospitals as if people would hear there was a flu shot there and run in and kill everybody for it.
[02:11:52.774 --> 02:11:58.557]  That was done to manipulate the police so the word got out that it was special so you would all go take it.
[02:11:59.795 --> 02:12:02.896]  And so the doctors and nurses would get the word it was special.
[02:12:02.896 --> 02:12:04.837]  And now they're doing it with the H1N1.
[02:12:04.837 --> 02:12:12.799]  And I told you, they keep announcing, we've got the flu shot, the H1N1, and in a big city, a few thousand morons will show up.
[02:12:12.799 --> 02:12:15.020]  They'll be lined up going, they ran out.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:20.281]  They didn't run out, they have 18 wheelers full of it on, that are refrigerated.
[02:12:20.281 --> 02:12:24.083]  They're doing that so the news can show long lines.
[02:12:24.083 --> 02:12:28.204]  Now I told you that, here's the Council on Foreign Relations,
[02:12:30.279 --> 02:12:32.000]  In a meeting, admitting it.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:32.520]  Here it is.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:40.905]  Then we cut to the news, reporting the same thing.
[02:12:40.905 --> 02:12:41.905]  Okay, we lost audio.
[02:12:41.905 --> 02:12:49.770]  I think what would work better would be to say that there was a shortage and people tend to line up more for something that's in demand.
[02:12:49.770 --> 02:12:50.310]  We saw that.
[02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:53.252]  There was one season where really people lined up all night to get a flu shot.
[02:12:55.114 --> 02:12:55.714]  Back it up.
[02:12:55.714 --> 02:12:56.815]  Back it up again.
[02:12:56.815 --> 02:12:58.076]  I want to play that one more time.
[02:12:58.076 --> 02:13:03.299]  Then it cuts to ABC News, a week after this was aired, doing the exact thing.
[02:13:03.299 --> 02:13:04.980]  And listen how they laugh.
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:18.949]  It's so fun to have all these government and university and medical heads, we list them here in the article, at InfoWars.com, CFR, Vaccines No Harmful, No More Harmful Than Tuna Sandwich, laughing about it.
[02:13:18.949 --> 02:13:22.291]  But then when they cut to the news, it's not done in a laughing fashion.
[02:13:22.291 --> 02:13:24.093]  It's done with, oh my gosh, we're dead.
[02:13:24.093 --> 02:13:24.453]  Here it is.
[02:13:28.658 --> 02:13:36.562]  I think what would work better would be to say that there was a shortage and people tend to line up more for something that's in demand.
[02:13:36.562 --> 02:13:37.122]  We saw that.
[02:13:37.122 --> 02:13:43.265]  There was one season where really people lined up all night to get a flu shot.
[02:13:43.265 --> 02:13:47.527]  ABC News puts the H1N1 vaccine artificial scarcity tactic to the test.
[02:13:47.527 --> 02:13:53.629]  And with supplies of the vaccine running low, doctors around the country are now finding themselves overrun with nervous parents.
[02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:54.950]  Here's ABC's Rachel Martin.
[02:13:56.274 --> 02:14:01.419]  For weeks, doctors' offices around the country have been fielding a flurry of phone calls.
[02:14:01.419 --> 02:14:05.664]  We do not have any H1N1 available at our office at this time.
[02:14:05.664 --> 02:14:07.666]  Telling patients the same thing.
[02:14:07.666 --> 02:14:10.248]  We are out of the flu shot vaccine right now.
[02:14:10.248 --> 02:14:10.809]  Panic now.
[02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:15.474]  In the next day, Swanson is in the office calling patients to tell them the vaccine is in.
[02:14:15.474 --> 02:14:15.974]  Vaccinate now.
[02:14:15.974 --> 02:14:16.555]  Alert.
[02:14:16.555 --> 02:14:17.296]  Alert.
[02:14:17.296 --> 02:14:18.437]  Oh my gosh, there's none of it.
[02:14:18.437 --> 02:14:19.518]  And we need to protect Michael.
[02:14:19.898 --> 02:14:23.620]  He's gonna be one of those kids that could end up in the hospital, and I don't think we want that.
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:26.022]  By 10 a.m., the waiting room is full.
[02:14:26.022 --> 02:14:34.927]  With the vaccine now in short supply, parents are lining up in doctors' offices like this one, hoping to get their questions answered and their kids vaccinated.
[02:14:34.927 --> 02:14:42.852]  I think what would work better would be to say that there was a shortage and people tend to line up more for something that's in demand.
[02:14:42.852 --> 02:14:43.413]  We saw that.
[02:14:43.413 --> 02:14:46.334]  There was one season where really people lined up all night to get a flu shot.
[02:14:48.695 --> 02:14:53.317]  For whatever reasons, I think it's pretty much safe to say that the media and the government are yanking your chain.
[02:14:53.317 --> 02:14:54.478]  That's what the maker of this said.
[02:14:54.478 --> 02:14:55.678]  Uh, yeah.
[02:14:55.678 --> 02:14:58.719]  There's sterilants in the shots.
[02:14:58.719 --> 02:14:59.320]  That's what's going on here.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:05.202]  Do you think that the people who are making it are putting it out in controlled amounts so that it is producing this demand?
[02:15:05.202 --> 02:15:06.343]  Absolutely.
[02:15:06.343 --> 02:15:06.923]  Absolutely.
[02:15:06.923 --> 02:15:09.624]  It's the drug companies that are making money at this.
[02:15:09.624 --> 02:15:11.105]  Who's making money at the end of the day?
[02:15:12.759 --> 02:15:30.951]  The participating members of the Council on Farm Relations Symposium include Arnold, and it goes through the names at the end and we have that up on the website, the Heads of Microbiology, Research Professor, Research Director, Department of Global Health, George Washington University, Science Magazine Correspondent.
[02:15:30.951 --> 02:15:31.291]  Shout!
[02:15:31.291 --> 02:15:31.571]  Shout!
[02:15:31.571 --> 02:15:33.552]  Talk about it!
[02:15:33.552 --> 02:15:34.853]  Alright, and that's the end of the clip.
[02:15:39.605 --> 02:15:50.913]  The good news is, once the public figures out the hundred or so tricks... I want to write a book, The Hundred Tricks of the New World Order.
[02:15:50.913 --> 02:15:52.514]  There's probably more than a hundred tricks.
[02:15:52.514 --> 02:15:54.675]  You could probably make it fifty tricks.
[02:15:54.675 --> 02:15:56.757]  But the point is, they have tricks.
[02:15:56.757 --> 02:16:04.322]  They have little manipulative games that they play, and they just do it perpetually to control people.
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:09.701]  But the good news is, you're getting wise to them.
[02:16:09.701 --> 02:16:13.283]  Now it's time to bring these people to justice.
[02:16:13.283 --> 02:16:21.626]  Because I'll guarantee you, there was memos went out to all the media, you hear the talking points, saying it's artificially scarce, telling you to come get it.
[02:16:21.626 --> 02:16:23.046]  That's criminal!
[02:16:23.046 --> 02:16:29.909]  But they've set the precedent where the media now just admits, yeah, most our TV shows and media and movies are paid for by the government.
[02:16:30.939 --> 02:16:32.620]  That isn't a free society, folks.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:39.204]  That's a spooky, devilish, cult, Nazi, Soviet, control freak society.
[02:16:39.204 --> 02:16:40.605]  Get it through your head.
[02:16:40.605 --> 02:16:42.306]  They're trying to manipulate you.
[02:16:42.306 --> 02:16:55.235]  Almost everything you watch and see is a manipulation, except for alternative news on the web, and that's full of disinfo and operatives and mentally ill people as well.
[02:16:55.235 --> 02:16:56.976]  So, check stuff out for yourself.
[02:16:56.976 --> 02:16:58.657]  Don't believe anything.
[02:16:58.657 --> 02:16:59.778]  Look into it for yourself.
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:01.863]  Let's talk to Carl in Texas.
[02:17:01.863 --> 02:17:07.056]  Carl, you're on the air.
[02:17:07.056 --> 02:17:08.299]  Carl, go ahead.
[02:17:09.076 --> 02:17:14.481]  Okay, look, I just had three questions from last week and you answered two of them.
[02:17:14.481 --> 02:17:20.946]  So I had to call back here and this is actually in relation to the FEMA camps that I wanted to find out about here in Houston.
[02:17:20.946 --> 02:17:27.152]  I'm just trying to find out, do you know of any facility where any of the facility camps might be in this area?
[02:17:27.152 --> 02:17:30.755]  And because the reason why I was asking is because I found out through another resource
[02:17:31.415 --> 02:17:59.331]  When you had a bunch of callers, I guess, calling in about five, six weeks ago, getting all these calls from other people, you know, seeing all this kind of military activity in their own neighborhoods, I talked to an ex-cop to kind of ask her to see if she could put her feelers out there and find out from other police officers if there's been any other military activity here in Houston, and somebody that was standing next to me said they actually closed off a highway, and this person said they saw hundreds of
[02:18:00.229 --> 02:18:04.092]  Uh, Humvees and, uh, armored police vehicles.
[02:18:04.092 --> 02:18:10.236]  So, I don't know if that's, uh, set up for anything, uh, for where these camps may be here.
[02:18:10.236 --> 02:18:11.176]  I have no idea.
[02:18:11.176 --> 02:18:12.437]  And that's why I was asking.
[02:18:12.437 --> 02:18:15.199]  Do you know of any facilities around this area?
[02:18:15.199 --> 02:18:16.680]  Okay, Carl, I appreciate your call.
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:20.882]  I guess you asked your first questions and I didn't hear the third one or I would have asked it.
[02:18:20.882 --> 02:18:23.684]  We also have time constraints.
[02:18:23.684 --> 02:18:29.348]  We sell a video that I consulted on and that I'm in called Camp FEMA.
[02:18:30.771 --> 02:18:44.539]  And it's all the government hearings, video clips, government documents with the names, Houston Chronicle, LA Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, admitting the camps, the legislation to expand the camps.
[02:18:44.539 --> 02:18:52.564]  The problem is, there's a lot of different types of camps, and a lot of different types of infrastructure.
[02:18:52.564 --> 02:18:57.167]  A, we have more prisons than any other country in the world, per capita.
[02:18:57.167 --> 02:19:00.289]  We have more, period, than any other country in the world, even China.
[02:19:01.328 --> 02:19:14.631]  B, under top-off NLE exercises and others, the government has drilled in every major city, publicly, to lock down cities and put you in sports stadiums and put Constantino wire around them.
[02:19:14.631 --> 02:19:19.532]  That's what dictators always use worldwide for over 100 years, is sports stadiums.
[02:19:19.532 --> 02:19:21.573]  So, there's your big camp.
[02:19:21.573 --> 02:19:30.255]  You got where the Houston Astros play, you got the Houston Texans, you got your high school facilities,
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:43.552]  You also have old military bases that they have refurbished with the barbed wire aiming in, but they don't put big neon signs up saying, this is a camp, this is a camp, this is a camp, this is a camp.
[02:19:43.552 --> 02:19:54.643]  We only know about it because of the funding through Congress for the purchase orders for the camps that have been in the Houston Chronicle and everywhere else.
[02:19:54.643 --> 02:19:55.824]  But that's your camps.
[02:19:57.725 --> 02:20:00.369]  Then you have things like Camp X-Ray and black sites around
[02:20:12.705 --> 02:20:16.307]  That's all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:20:16.307 --> 02:20:21.470]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[02:20:21.470 --> 02:20:22.731]  Boy, was I wrong.
[02:20:22.731 --> 02:20:25.933]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[02:20:25.933 --> 02:20:29.735]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[02:20:29.735 --> 02:20:32.957]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[02:20:32.957 --> 02:20:33.498]  Wow!
[02:20:33.498 --> 02:20:35.039]  I watched the DVD last night.
[02:20:35.039 --> 02:20:36.260]  I was awestruck.
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:37.780]  What wonderful work you have done.
[02:20:37.780 --> 02:20:40.102]  This information can bless many people.
[02:20:40.462 --> 02:20:41.663]  Thank you again.
[02:20:41.663 --> 02:20:42.424]  Thanks again!
[02:20:42.424 --> 02:20:45.547]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[02:20:45.547 --> 02:20:46.148]  Thank you.
[02:20:46.148 --> 02:20:49.572]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[02:21:03.191 --> 02:21:04.052]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.052 --> 02:21:04.372]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.372 --> 02:21:09.415]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.415 --> 02:21:11.056]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.056 --> 02:21:11.796]  Startpage?
[02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:13.297]  Yeah, Startpage.com.

[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:05.521]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:22:05.521 --> 02:22:09.843]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:22:09.843 --> 02:22:15.605]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:22:15.605 --> 02:22:17.005]  It's true, total government
[02:22:17.085 --> 02:22:17.445]  We're good.
[02:22:37.561 --> 02:22:41.705]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:22:41.705 --> 02:22:46.770]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:23:00.922 --> 02:23:06.805]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[02:23:06.805 --> 02:23:11.928]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[02:23:11.928 --> 02:23:13.149]  That was then.
[02:23:13.149 --> 02:23:14.450]  This is now.
[02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:16.631]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[02:23:17.151 --> 02:23:23.213]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[02:23:23.213 --> 02:23:32.437]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:35.178]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[02:23:35.898 --> 02:23:40.382]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[02:23:40.382 --> 02:23:41.883]  Video never lies.
[02:23:41.883 --> 02:23:43.545]  Watch Big Brother back.
[02:23:43.545 --> 02:23:45.326]  Visit Diginet.net.
[02:23:45.326 --> 02:23:48.309]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:50.911]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:23:50.911 --> 02:23:52.592]  Diginet dot net.
[02:23:52.592 --> 02:23:53.093]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[02:23:53.093 --> 02:23:53.293]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[02:24:38.527 --> 02:24:52.814]  Okay, on the subject of FEMA camps, I predicted two months before, whenever Glenn Beck came out and said, I believe the camps are real, but we're doing an investigation, I even named the fake camps he was going to name.
[02:24:53.988 --> 02:25:01.733]  Because I had debunked him back in 96, 97, the Indiana Amtrak terminal and others.
[02:25:01.733 --> 02:25:03.994]  And then he did one and didn't attribute the source.
[02:25:03.994 --> 02:25:11.158]  He showed a satellite photo of a North Korean labor camp and then just said someone made it up.
[02:25:11.158 --> 02:25:12.639]  So you can always find this info.
[02:25:12.639 --> 02:25:17.082]  You can find people on the web saying blood-drinking chupacabras control things.
[02:25:17.082 --> 02:25:18.243]  That doesn't mean it's the case.
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:30.967]  And so, he didn't address the Houston Chronicle, the civilian inmate labor camp program that lists, in the original document 12, now 24, civilian inmate labor camp programs.
[02:25:30.967 --> 02:25:33.509]  It doesn't list the super maxes around the country.
[02:25:33.509 --> 02:25:35.090]  They're opening for political dissidence.
[02:25:35.090 --> 02:25:36.991]  That's been ABC News, U.S.
[02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:37.811]  News World Report.
[02:25:37.811 --> 02:25:44.636]  I mean, people are still calling me saying, where's the proof they're gonna put the military on the streets?
[02:25:45.538 --> 02:25:50.701]  AP, Reuters, Army Times, Pentagon, Northcom.
[02:25:50.701 --> 02:25:53.522]  They want 379,000 troops.
[02:25:53.522 --> 02:25:56.064]  They've already got 40,000 troops on the streets.
[02:25:56.064 --> 02:26:00.546]  Marines and Army are everywhere running illegal checkpoints, unannounced.
[02:26:00.546 --> 02:26:02.207]  But it's confirmed in local news.
[02:26:02.207 --> 02:26:05.228]  Local news says, why are Marines out searching people?
[02:26:05.228 --> 02:26:07.550]  Well, you're not for drunks, are you?
[02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:12.052]  It's for PR purposes to set the table and get everybody prepared for this.
[02:26:14.053 --> 02:26:24.778]  It's like 10 years ago, I'd read Club of Rome and UN documents how they were gonna have a global carbon tax and tax carbon dioxide and people wrote big national articles saying I was a lying, crazy kook.
[02:26:24.778 --> 02:26:39.544]  Three years ago, when I made Endgame, right as I was about to release it, I had the heir to the Rothschild fortune on, Lord Rothschild's son, who heads up all these big green movements, but David the Rothschild,
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:47.062]  Lord Rothschild's son, and I said, it's a carbon tax.
[02:26:47.062 --> 02:26:49.404]  He said, no, that's a conspiracy theory and laughed at me.
[02:26:49.404 --> 02:26:51.165]  Now he knew it was a carbon tax.
[02:26:51.165 --> 02:26:57.129]  Then we cut to Al Gore that same week saying it's a carbon tax.
[02:26:57.129 --> 02:27:03.733]  But see, they had national media say it didn't exist for years, so we couldn't build an opposition.
[02:27:03.733 --> 02:27:05.074]  They know you're lazy.
[02:27:05.074 --> 02:27:06.735]  They know you want to rationalize.
[02:27:06.735 --> 02:27:08.196]  They know you don't want to get involved.
[02:27:09.636 --> 02:27:13.019]  Hitler said that good propaganda speaks to people's laziness.
[02:27:13.019 --> 02:27:14.060]  And it's simple.
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:16.983]  It's not complex like this radio show.
[02:27:16.983 --> 02:27:19.044]  And so it's real simple.
[02:27:19.044 --> 02:27:20.266]  There's no carbon tax.
[02:27:20.266 --> 02:27:21.727]  There's no global government.
[02:27:21.727 --> 02:27:23.168]  The banks didn't engineer this.
[02:27:23.168 --> 02:27:24.529]  There's no plan.
[02:27:24.529 --> 02:27:26.031]  Well, I have all these documents.
[02:27:26.031 --> 02:27:26.992]  I have all these textbooks.
[02:27:26.992 --> 02:27:28.833]  I have all these plans.
[02:27:28.833 --> 02:27:30.655]  You're about to pass the legislation.
[02:27:30.655 --> 02:27:31.455]  It's passed the House.
[02:27:31.455 --> 02:27:32.056]  It's in the Senate.
[02:27:34.930 --> 02:27:49.133]  Salon and New Republic and all these big publications every week say Alex Jones is insane and believes there's a global government and a carbon tax and they laugh.
[02:27:49.133 --> 02:27:55.294]  They're laughing so weak-minded people who are looking, look at that and go, must be nothing here.
[02:27:55.294 --> 02:27:56.975]  Yeah, that guy's a kook.
[02:27:56.975 --> 02:28:00.035]  He gets angry.
[02:28:00.035 --> 02:28:02.996]  And then once they pass it, they say, we always said we were going to do this.
[02:28:04.161 --> 02:28:05.441]  It's the same thing with FEMA camps.
[02:28:05.441 --> 02:28:07.302]  Everybody calls me about, are there troops?
[02:28:07.302 --> 02:28:08.563]  I heard there were troops.
[02:28:08.563 --> 02:28:13.904]  And I'm like, well here, here's 500 mainstream news articles plus on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:28:13.904 --> 02:28:17.246]  We've had the Army Colonels on, the Army Generals, the Marines on.
[02:28:17.246 --> 02:28:18.366]  We've had local news on.
[02:28:18.366 --> 02:28:20.727]  We've had state police press releases.
[02:28:26.109 --> 02:28:40.724]  I mean, I remember since 99, I would release leaked government documents stating that the government was setting up a federalized police force for gun owners, conservatives, landowners, rural people.
[02:28:40.724 --> 02:28:42.565]  And the spy networks.
[02:28:42.565 --> 02:28:44.267]  And people paid attention some.
[02:28:44.267 --> 02:28:47.711]  Now I release those documents, it finally breaks into the mainstream news.
[02:28:48.854 --> 02:28:50.996]  That's why we're now dangerous.
[02:28:50.996 --> 02:28:59.823]  Because we have a big enough audience of activists to, if we do everything we can and hit them as hard as we can, we can punch through.
[02:28:59.823 --> 02:29:02.925]  We've just now gotten to the point where we can land blows.
[02:29:02.925 --> 02:29:08.489]  We've just now gotten to the point where we can get in the boxing ring with these people and hold our own.
[02:29:08.489 --> 02:29:16.616]  And we're bleeding and got black eyes and they're beating the hell out of us, but we've knocked them to the mat a few times and, you know, we're totally focused and committed.
[02:29:16.616 --> 02:29:17.797]  It's a thriller in Manila.
[02:29:19.116 --> 02:29:22.657]  And if we can just keep the rounds going, we're going to beat these people.
[02:29:22.657 --> 02:29:25.617]  Because they're now in afterburner.
[02:29:25.617 --> 02:29:32.958]  They're trying to bring it in, so they're lying about everything, while simultaneously admitting they're setting up a world government.
[02:29:32.958 --> 02:29:36.279]  All these years they've denied it, so it's blowing up in their face.
[02:29:36.279 --> 02:29:38.139]  They say there's no mercury in the shot.
[02:29:38.139 --> 02:29:40.940]  Millions of people are reading the insert and reading that.
[02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:43.440]  People are waking up.
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:46.901]  And it's this radio audience that has more credit than anybody.
[02:29:46.901 --> 02:29:47.541]  I salute you.
[02:29:51.454 --> 02:29:55.405]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.405 --> 02:29:58.072]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.609 --> 02:30:07.592]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:07.592 --> 02:30:09.673]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:31:00.370 --> 02:31:04.933]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.933 --> 02:31:05.833]  Number one.
[02:31:05.833 --> 02:31:09.256]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.256 --> 02:31:10.116]  Number two.
[02:31:10.116 --> 02:31:15.019]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.019 --> 02:31:15.760]  It's true.
[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:20.623]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.623 --> 02:31:21.463]  Number three.
[02:31:21.463 --> 02:31:25.046]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.046 --> 02:31:28.748]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.948 --> 02:31:29.749]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.749 --> 02:31:32.492]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.492 --> 02:31:36.196]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.196 --> 02:31:36.977]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.977 --> 02:31:41.122]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.122 --> 02:31:45.887]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.167 --> 02:31:50.331]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.331 --> 02:31:52.132]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.132 --> 02:31:54.375]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.375 --> 02:32:00.240]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:07.987]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[02:32:07.987 --> 02:32:12.311]  You can buy it at hereswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks.
[02:32:12.671 --> 02:32:14.032]  Or the book for 10 bucks.

[02:32:16.993 --> 02:32:23.275]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:23.275 --> 02:32:24.855]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:32:24.855 --> 02:32:27.356]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:27.356 --> 02:32:30.697]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy.
[02:32:30.697 --> 02:32:32.658]  And it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:32.958 --> 02:32:35.058]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.058 --> 02:32:36.799]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:36.799 --> 02:32:39.319]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.319 --> 02:32:44.040]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:47.761]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:47.761 --> 02:32:50.882]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:50.882 --> 02:32:52.782]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:52.782 --> 02:32:54.903]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:18.146 --> 02:33:22.483]  Years ago, I said that when they begin to announce the camps to everyone...
[02:33:25.916 --> 02:33:32.380]  That it would be advertised as an emergency shelter, as a community place for all the homeless.
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:34.381]  Yes, you've got to be searched.
[02:33:34.381 --> 02:33:36.142]  Yes, they split the families up.
[02:33:36.142 --> 02:33:39.244]  Yes, CPS preys on your children when you're inside of them.
[02:33:39.244 --> 02:33:48.289]  Now they have the Emergency Centers Act in Congress, admitting they already have six giant regional FEMA camps on military bases.
[02:33:48.289 --> 02:33:51.811]  They're merging the National Guard, the regular Army, and fusion centers.
[02:33:51.811 --> 02:33:52.612]  And here's an article
[02:33:55.322 --> 02:33:59.723]  County pursues emergency shelter.
[02:33:59.723 --> 02:34:23.531]  The Adams County Board of Supervisors voted money to tentatively move forward with plans for an emergency shelter at US-61 to be run by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and is meant to serve as a durable shelter during a hurricane or tornado events, but to also act dually for during civil unrest, as the Houston Chronicle and Wall Street Journal have reported.
[02:34:23.531 --> 02:34:24.771]  They're building these everywhere.
[02:34:26.107 --> 02:34:31.568]  And half of American children, AP reports today, are on food stamps.
[02:34:31.568 --> 02:34:34.189]  And 90% of black children.
[02:34:34.189 --> 02:34:35.729]  They want you bankrupted.
[02:34:35.729 --> 02:34:39.430]  That's in their own documents I read in the second hour.
[02:34:39.430 --> 02:34:41.210]  Statements by the UN.
[02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:43.111]  Statements by the federal government.
[02:34:43.111 --> 02:34:45.291]  They want the government to bankrupt things.
[02:34:45.291 --> 02:34:52.332]  And I'll say this, this morning I watched a 10 minute interview uncut with Rush Limbaugh on Fox.
[02:34:52.332 --> 02:34:54.993]  I watched the, on bretbart.com, I watched it.
[02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:58.731]  And Limbaugh told the truth.
[02:34:58.731 --> 02:35:04.155]  He said Obama wants to destroy the economy by design, so the government can take over.
[02:35:04.155 --> 02:35:08.097]  And they want 1-6th, not 1-7th, it is more like 1-6th, closer to 20%, 1-5th.
[02:35:11.578 --> 02:35:19.142]  It's like one-fifth and a half, if you want to get technical, of the economy to take over every facet of your lives, to take over and regulate everything.
[02:35:19.142 --> 02:35:20.623]  And the bill says that!
[02:35:20.623 --> 02:35:26.947]  And the bill's got the death penalty panels, and it's got the forced compulsory insurance.
[02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:39.543]  But see, Limbaugh can tell the truth now, because Bush is out of office, so he can play the part of the opposition, just like Glenn Beck can.
[02:35:39.543 --> 02:35:43.469]  So when they put in a right-wing savior in three years, or seven years, or whatever the case is,
[02:35:45.919 --> 02:35:48.520]  People will think the Republicans are going to save them.
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:57.204]  And we hear about the soul of the Republican Party and everywhere the mantra, Republicans better get mainline and better compromise or they're going to lose.
[02:35:57.204 --> 02:36:01.846]  No, Republicans had better become libertarian and constitutionalist.
[02:36:01.846 --> 02:36:07.449]  And every poll shows Hispanics, blacks, whites, Asians would vote for them in droves.
[02:36:07.449 --> 02:36:09.289]  It shows they would win by a landslide.
[02:36:09.289 --> 02:36:12.411]  But they won't vote for Republicans because they know they're a bunch of criminals.
[02:36:15.472 --> 02:36:17.434]  By the way, Ron Paul's on the show Thursday.
[02:36:17.434 --> 02:36:21.998]  We got Stubblebine and Labo tomorrow, and a bunch of other surprise guests Friday.
[02:36:21.998 --> 02:36:23.440]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.702]  Big shows tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday.
[02:36:25.702 --> 02:36:39.936]  Important, informative, but I almost want to get on a plane, go get the passes, go in and knock on doors and lobby myself with these congressmen, get a list of Republicans that say they're going to vote, and Democrats for the climate bill.
[02:36:40.751 --> 02:36:49.220]  I mean, this is happening right now, and they wouldn't even let the House read it until they'd already started voting on it three months ago, and the same crap in the Senate.
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:55.427]  They're now debating it right now and just released the Senate version.
[02:36:55.427 --> 02:36:56.529]  They know you're waking up.
[02:36:57.543 --> 02:36:59.104]  So they're swarming us from every angle.
[02:36:59.104 --> 02:37:03.285]  I'm gonna go to Charles, Chris, Jack, and Mark here in a moment.
[02:37:03.285 --> 02:37:06.206]  I wanted to bring Ted up for five minutes, and I am going to your calls.
[02:37:06.206 --> 02:37:08.287]  But no matter how important your questions are, I gotta go quick.
[02:37:08.287 --> 02:37:13.029]  The guy asked me a concentration camp question, and I gotta give him a full-spectrum breakdown.
[02:37:13.029 --> 02:37:17.270]  That's why you should buy the DVD, Camp FEMA, at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:18.130]  We got it at half price.
[02:37:18.130 --> 02:37:19.691]  When you get it, we follow the Republic.
[02:37:19.691 --> 02:37:24.913]  Then you support us and have a high-production-value film that I certify is accurate.
[02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:28.602]  That's why I consulted on The Stinkin' Thing.
[02:37:28.602 --> 02:37:30.583]  I didn't have time to make one myself.
[02:37:30.583 --> 02:37:37.009]  I encouraged them to make that film.
[02:37:37.009 --> 02:37:38.150]  They did a great job.
[02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:39.492]  Order The Stinkin' Thing.
[02:37:39.492 --> 02:37:42.995]  Have the answer for people about the camps.
[02:37:42.995 --> 02:37:44.576]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:57.534]  Alright, I want to bring up our biggest and longest sponsor, the owner of the Genesis Network, and who I've chosen to buy gold and silver from.
[02:37:57.534 --> 02:37:59.958]  And gold went up again today to record heights!
[02:38:02.699 --> 02:38:10.685]  And Ted is still holding the price of gold he bought at $1,020 an ounce, is what the market was, and silver even lower, but it isn't going to last long.
[02:38:10.685 --> 02:38:14.948]  He sold out of the gold at $950 when it was $1,030.
[02:38:14.948 --> 02:38:18.671]  He sold out of the gold that was $1,000 when it was $1,045.
[02:38:18.671 --> 02:38:25.877]  Now he's about to sell out of gold at $1,200, that's what the market was, gold he priced at that level in the market, now when it's $1,060.
[02:38:25.877 --> 02:38:25.917]  So,
[02:38:31.246 --> 02:38:32.127]  He's got it.
[02:38:32.127 --> 02:38:32.787]  Great deal.
[02:38:32.787 --> 02:38:36.909]  Frank's Sovereigns in the gold coins, silver coins he's got.
[02:38:36.909 --> 02:38:39.051]  But they won't be here long at this price.
[02:38:39.051 --> 02:38:40.832]  Ted Anderson, good to have you here with us.
[02:38:40.832 --> 02:38:42.312]  Yeah, nice to have me up again.
[02:38:42.312 --> 02:38:44.194]  I'd be up with you again, Alex.
[02:38:44.194 --> 02:38:46.535]  I gotta tell you, what an awesome day in gold.
[02:38:47.316 --> 02:38:51.659]  It was this time the Indian people that pushed the gold up to where it is today.
[02:38:51.659 --> 02:38:52.840]  It has been China.
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:39:09.654]  I mean, every time we go to sleep, gold takes this big spike, but it happened actually in the New York market today, and it was driven by the Indian people, and gold right now just touched just underneath $1,090 an ounce, which means that that $1,100 an ounce gold is just a whisker away
[02:39:14.338 --> 02:39:18.761]  And I believe in all my heart and soul that that's going to happen.
[02:39:18.761 --> 02:39:23.925]  Well, this is exactly what Bob Chapman has been calling by the numbers.
[02:39:23.925 --> 02:39:27.047]  He said it would go up to 1,060, back down to 130.
[02:39:27.047 --> 02:39:31.550]  Then next it would find its footing at 1,080 plus.
[02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:33.111]  Then he said it would go down to 160.
[02:39:33.111 --> 02:39:38.915]  Then it'll go, and once it goes over 1,100, that's a psychological barrier again.
[02:39:38.915 --> 02:39:40.076]  The sky's then the limit.
[02:39:40.436 --> 02:39:45.601]  Regardless, it's real, it's a precious metal, you've got an insanely good deal on it.
[02:39:45.601 --> 02:39:47.483]  Folks are insane!
[02:39:47.483 --> 02:39:51.747]  You're selling gold that you bought in the market when it was almost $70 under.
[02:39:51.747 --> 02:39:54.749]  Right now, gold is at $1,085.10 an ounce.
[02:39:54.749 --> 02:39:56.431]  It went to $1,089 and change just an hour ago.
[02:39:56.431 --> 02:39:57.292]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:40:06.929 --> 02:40:08.710]  This is a time machine.
[02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:17.417]  You get to get in a time machine, go back to the prices over a month ago, but some of you probably won't.
[02:40:17.417 --> 02:40:18.358]  You can buy one coin.
[02:40:18.358 --> 02:40:19.579]  You can buy a thousand coins.
[02:40:19.579 --> 02:40:22.601]  Ted has got it right now for delivery to you.
[02:40:22.601 --> 02:40:23.822]  Ted, tell us what you got.
[02:40:23.822 --> 02:40:30.227]  Well, again, Alex, I was on your show just yesterday and we're talking about the francs at $2.36 and the British sovereign was at $2.91.
[02:40:31.628 --> 02:40:37.072]  Gold has gone up over $30 an ounce today, and I have the same gold at the same price.
[02:40:37.072 --> 02:40:45.478]  And I am just grateful to the Federal Reserve System and the central banks of the world for depressing the prices of gold down to that $1,020 area so I could buy it.
[02:40:47.359 --> 02:40:48.100]  But guess what?
[02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:57.086]  They lost the battle again, and now gold is up almost at $1,100 an ounce, and I just can't say it enough, that is a fabulous buy.
[02:40:57.086 --> 02:41:08.855]  And I was also able to get myself locked back into some more of those walking liberties at $8.69, and that is just, oh man, I can't tell you, that's a great price.
[02:41:08.855 --> 02:41:13.659]  And at this particular time in the marketplace, compare it to the Federal Reserve note,
[02:41:14.119 --> 02:41:15.280]  I mean, you just can't beat it.
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:25.127]  I don't know how people can see that staying in paper is a better idea than having a piece of gold that actually takes human labor to pull out of the ground.
[02:41:25.127 --> 02:41:28.189]  Ted, Citibank, as you know, declared for bankruptcy yesterday.
[02:41:28.189 --> 02:41:30.191]  What was the third largest bank?
[02:41:31.091 --> 02:41:32.432]  They're consolidating.
[02:41:32.432 --> 02:41:40.958]  Have you read the McClatchy Newspaper's syndicated analysis, 10-page report, how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[02:41:40.958 --> 02:41:44.701]  housing crash to consolidate the market and bring down Bear Stearns?
[02:41:44.701 --> 02:41:48.504]  That's what our guest a year ago said they were doing and said it was criminal.
[02:41:48.504 --> 02:41:51.306]  Max Keiser, Gerald Solente, Bob Chapman,
[02:41:52.554 --> 02:41:55.435]  Professor Black, there needs to be indictments.
[02:41:55.435 --> 02:42:00.857]  Why can't we just finally, this is what's getting me in hot water, that's why they're after me, because I know the silver bullet.
[02:42:00.857 --> 02:42:02.378]  Arrest these bastards!
[02:42:02.378 --> 02:42:03.619]  It could all end!
[02:42:03.619 --> 02:42:04.839]  It could all stop!
[02:42:04.839 --> 02:42:08.641]  It's a bunch of made-off criminals, a bunch of Ken Lay types.
[02:42:08.641 --> 02:42:12.102]  Ken Lay wrote the Al Gore carbon tax 12 years ago.
[02:42:12.102 --> 02:42:14.163]  I mean, Ted, it's like Groundhog Day.
[02:42:14.163 --> 02:42:16.764]  We keep waking up to the same nightmare as it gets worse.
[02:42:16.764 --> 02:42:19.765]  We need to identify, well, that's another issue.
[02:42:19.765 --> 02:42:20.826]  The point here is, Ted,
[02:42:22.216 --> 02:42:25.198]  My God, Jed, how high is gold going to go?
[02:42:25.198 --> 02:42:26.758]  Well, that's a good question.
[02:42:26.758 --> 02:42:31.401]  We break through this $1,100 an ounce and I would say the next target is going to be up there around $1,300.
[02:42:31.401 --> 02:42:32.001]  I truly believe
[02:42:35.385 --> 02:42:44.331]  With the momentum that we have going on in this market, I don't think this bull market's over until we've seen $2,600 an ounce and we've gone beyond that level.
[02:42:44.331 --> 02:42:50.815]  And by the way, that's what the conservative commentators are saying on Fox and CNN everywhere and MSNBC and CNBC.
[02:42:50.815 --> 02:42:51.656]  Some people are saying $6,000.
[02:42:51.656 --> 02:42:53.477]  Hey, but you know what, Ted?
[02:42:53.477 --> 02:42:58.260]  Gold I bought at $300 an ounce or less that I bought eight years ago, guess what?
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:00.642]  Alex Jones hadn't sold that back to you, has he, Teddy?
[02:43:00.802 --> 02:43:02.143]  No, you're still holding onto it.
[02:43:02.143 --> 02:43:05.904]  That's right, because it's an emergency to keep my business going.
[02:43:05.904 --> 02:43:08.846]  It's an emergency money for my children and my wife.
[02:43:08.846 --> 02:43:11.047]  It's an emergency if we get sued.
[02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:13.768]  I can always have something to defend myself with.
[02:43:13.768 --> 02:43:17.250]  And again, I don't have it for an investment.
[02:43:17.250 --> 02:43:18.550]  I'm not selling it.
[02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:21.572]  Even though most of the gold and silver I bought was silver at $5, gold at $300 or lower.
[02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:33.689]  And the bottom line here is, ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat getting into gold and silver right now.
[02:43:33.689 --> 02:43:36.472]  And if you ever saw it start dropping, you can dump it.
[02:43:36.472 --> 02:43:38.213]  Why would people stay in paper, Ted?
[02:43:39.470 --> 02:43:40.811]  It kind of boggles my mind.
[02:43:40.811 --> 02:43:54.936]  I mean obviously people have been lulled into the idea that paper is better than gold and that happened in 1971 when Richard Nixon was in office and he had to close the gold window and we went into a complete fiat paper system.
[02:43:55.756 --> 02:44:11.770]  I can tell you, in the 1980s, there was a tremendous effort by the central banks to suppress the gold below $400 an ounce, and as long as we had foreign money being lent to us, we're able to live on that prosperity that somebody else created, and we're able to do it.
[02:44:11.770 --> 02:44:12.331]  But you know what?
[02:44:12.551 --> 02:44:15.552]  And there isn't a foreign nation out there that wants U.S.
[02:44:15.552 --> 02:44:22.854]  government securities anymore, and it just doesn't make sense to be on a fiat currency when the whole world is trying to get away from it.
[02:44:22.854 --> 02:44:30.336]  It's almost like the people of the United States, the majority of them at this point in time, have their head in the sand and think that this is going to all get better for them.
[02:44:30.336 --> 02:44:32.276]  And I got news for you, it's not.
[02:44:32.276 --> 02:44:39.138]  When you see the government doing what they're doing and printing money like there's no tomorrow, the United States dollar is doomed.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:43.548]  Ted, I'm going to go to calls here in a moment, but I want to finish up on this.
[02:44:44.522 --> 02:44:46.444]  I'm looking at modestresources.com.
[02:44:46.444 --> 02:44:51.548]  You have the live 24-hour spot gold, live 24-hour spot silver.
[02:44:51.548 --> 02:44:58.014]  The graphs are almost identical above and below each other, showing the market manipulation.
[02:44:58.014 --> 02:45:03.499]  And now the Federal Reserve has been admitting what they wouldn't admit previously, that they're manipulating the price down.
[02:45:03.499 --> 02:45:10.064]  And as you said, they're losing the battle because the dollar's plunging, because of the actions the bankers have taken.
[02:45:10.885 --> 02:45:13.946]  Folks, give Midas Resources a call.
[02:45:13.946 --> 02:45:15.666]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[02:45:15.666 --> 02:45:20.168]  Well, I'm going to be holding this one just for tonight because gold has gone up way too much.
[02:45:20.168 --> 02:45:26.990]  It's not going to be a surprise to me to see gold up over $1,090 an ounce, so I'll have to hold on this one.
[02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:32.691]  I usually say I'll see what happens, but I'm quite certain that I'm going to have to raise my prices tomorrow.
[02:45:32.691 --> 02:45:33.252]  800-686-2237.
[02:45:33.252 --> 02:45:35.052]  The word on the street was there was going to be a
[02:45:38.877 --> 02:45:40.359]  Stock market crash this week.
[02:45:40.359 --> 02:45:41.360]  I didn't go with that.
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:45.466]  I hope that's not the case, but this ain't looking good with Citibank going down this week.
[02:45:45.466 --> 02:45:51.995]  I was told last week Citibank was going to go under by a high-powered financial reporter I was talking to trying to get on the show.
[02:45:51.995 --> 02:45:53.016]  He won't come on the show.
[02:45:54.137 --> 02:46:00.018]  But he said that, off the record, Citibank was probably going to go under and that we were going to have a crash this week.
[02:46:00.018 --> 02:46:01.718]  I don't know if that's the case.
[02:46:01.718 --> 02:46:06.779]  I got this word from other high-powered media people that I've talked to.
[02:46:06.779 --> 02:46:09.540]  I hope that's not the case, but this isn't looking good.
[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:19.201]  Folks, get into gold and silver right now, because when the yuppies find out that this is the right investment, you're not going to be able to get gold and silver without paying a premium that's off the charts.
[02:46:19.201 --> 02:46:21.322]  This is a great deal, a fabulous deal, $800.
[02:46:22.142 --> 02:46:22.322]  686-2237.
[02:46:22.322 --> 02:46:22.442]  800-686-2237.
[02:46:22.442 --> 02:46:22.542]  800-686-2237.
[02:46:22.542 --> 02:46:23.103]  Now is the time.
[02:46:23.103 --> 02:46:23.323]  800-686-2237.
[02:46:23.323 --> 02:46:24.284]  They're there till midnight.
[02:46:39.159 --> 02:46:43.942]  Tonight, and you're probably not going to get this deal again tomorrow because Ted's going to sell out of gold.
[02:46:43.942 --> 02:46:52.026]  He bought at the 120 level with it now right up at $1,090 an ounce, breaking all-time records by over $30.
[02:46:52.026 --> 02:46:54.888]  This is incredible.
[02:46:54.888 --> 02:46:55.068]  800-686-2237.
[02:46:55.068 --> 02:46:58.250]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:46:58.250 --> 02:47:01.952]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:47:01.952 --> 02:47:02.012]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:02.012 --> 02:47:03.213]  Don't be stupid, folks.
[02:47:03.213 --> 02:47:04.694]  Okay, I want to go to Charles in Louisiana.
[02:47:04.694 --> 02:47:05.874]  Charles, thanks for holding.
[02:47:05.874 --> 02:47:06.475]  You're on the air.
[02:47:06.475 --> 02:47:06.835]  Go ahead.
[02:47:07.486 --> 02:47:08.647]  How you doing, my friend?
[02:47:08.647 --> 02:47:09.728]  Good.
[02:47:09.728 --> 02:47:14.491]  Well, I'll tell you, you said you apologized to people for screaming.
[02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:17.693]  Alex, they need to apologize to you.
[02:47:17.693 --> 02:47:20.395]  You putting out everything on the line.
[02:47:20.395 --> 02:47:24.818]  The people need to apologize for you because of their cowardice.
[02:47:24.818 --> 02:47:26.319]  But I tell you what the people's got.
[02:47:26.319 --> 02:47:28.360]  They don't want to wake people up.
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:29.541]  They don't want to make tapes.
[02:47:29.541 --> 02:47:31.282]  They don't want to talk to people.
[02:47:31.282 --> 02:47:35.145]  They're going to have the real thing, the cattle prize, see the kids raped.
[02:47:35.692 --> 02:47:38.294]  I mean, like in New Orleans, people trying to leave New Orleans.
[02:47:38.294 --> 02:47:41.636]  They shot people trying to leave New Orleans to ask for water.
[02:47:41.636 --> 02:47:49.140]  They would put dogs... You were one of the emergency workers and you called first and said police had mowed down people trying to walk out.
[02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:50.801]  I reported that to you first, yes.
[02:47:50.801 --> 02:47:52.502]  And now they've been convicted.
[02:47:52.502 --> 02:47:54.864]  It didn't come out for six months that you told the truth.
[02:47:54.864 --> 02:47:56.004]  Yes.
[02:47:56.004 --> 02:47:58.146]  And the military called it a laboratory.
[02:47:58.146 --> 02:48:03.509]  They locked it down, didn't let people get aid to set the precedent for FEMA to get more power.
[02:48:04.229 --> 02:48:08.990]  Yes, and I've reported to you for years, many things over the years.
[02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:13.751]  I was the first one really to start putting out tapes by the mass, by the hundreds.
[02:48:13.751 --> 02:48:16.592]  You've been putting my films out for a decade, haven't you?
[02:48:16.592 --> 02:48:19.873]  Yes, I put out, I quit now, but 7,400.
[02:48:19.873 --> 02:48:20.553]  7,400.
[02:48:20.553 --> 02:48:22.693]  I quit about three years ago.
[02:48:22.693 --> 02:48:25.494]  I had to, after the storm, you know, got me.
[02:48:25.494 --> 02:48:27.074]  But I put out all your tapes.
[02:48:27.074 --> 02:48:29.275]  I beg people to wake people up.
[02:48:29.275 --> 02:48:30.335]  I gave them to policemen.
[02:48:30.788 --> 02:48:33.330]  I'll give him everything, but I'm going to tell you something.
[02:48:33.330 --> 02:48:35.592]  I'm ashamed to be American, Alex.
[02:48:35.592 --> 02:48:39.355]  I never thought that the people would be this dumb and this stupid.
[02:48:39.355 --> 02:48:40.656]  You know, that's a good point.
[02:48:40.656 --> 02:48:48.622]  They can't get hundreds of countries to pass the carbon tax takeover, but America is going to lead the way into global slavery.
[02:48:48.622 --> 02:48:50.223]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[02:48:50.223 --> 02:48:51.584]  I've been through a lot in my life.
[02:48:51.584 --> 02:48:54.186]  You know, I've been through 17 years.
[02:48:54.186 --> 02:48:56.188]  I've been through prison camps.
[02:48:56.188 --> 02:48:59.370]  And I'm going to tell the American people, you all think you're running.
[02:48:59.370 --> 02:49:00.591]  You all think you're hiding.
[02:49:01.021 --> 02:49:13.227]  You don't want to look at the truth, but when they put you up there, people, and you're drinking your own blood and drinking out of a commode, think of Alex, think of me, because you all are doing nothing but talk.
[02:49:14.025 --> 02:49:15.066]  I hate that.
[02:49:15.066 --> 02:49:16.847]  I'm ashamed to be American.
[02:49:16.847 --> 02:49:21.829]  I never thought America would be this cowardly to let a handful of people take them.
[02:49:21.829 --> 02:49:24.851]  Their kids are going to be taken away from them, their property, Alex.
[02:49:24.851 --> 02:49:27.512]  They're going to be like New Orleans, begging for water.
[02:49:27.512 --> 02:49:31.154]  The military say, if you're thirsty, honey, show me something.
[02:49:31.154 --> 02:49:34.296]  Women had to show them their own breasts for a little bottle of water.
[02:49:34.775 --> 02:49:36.836]  For a bottle of water, Alex.
[02:49:36.836 --> 02:49:39.476]  That's what they, they got us down like animals.
[02:49:39.476 --> 02:49:42.497]  And these people up here, they're waiting for somebody else to do it.
[02:49:42.497 --> 02:49:44.358]  They're waiting for you to save this country.
[02:49:44.358 --> 02:49:45.338]  They ain't gonna do it.
[02:49:45.338 --> 02:49:46.598]  They're gonna watch football.
[02:49:46.598 --> 02:49:48.039]  They're football freaks.
[02:49:48.039 --> 02:49:53.500]  But their children and them, their generation, they, in two more years, they won't have a country.
[02:49:56.604 --> 02:50:01.969]  Well, this is the long slide into total tyranny, and it's not, like I say, a boss hog corruption.
[02:50:01.969 --> 02:50:03.991]  This is hardcore.
[02:50:03.991 --> 02:50:18.745]  The same people that funded Hitler and Lenin and Stalin and Mao on record write textbooks bragging that once their police state grid's in place, once everybody's bankrupt, they're going to have helicopters fly over and spray nerve gas on us.
[02:50:18.745 --> 02:50:20.807]  And that came out with the Sunshine Project in 2000.
[02:50:22.048 --> 02:50:24.210]  They got the government documents on that.
[02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:32.257]  Every city has helicopters and government hangars with lethal and non-lethal nerve gas ready for us.
[02:50:32.257 --> 02:50:34.699]  I mean, that's how evil these people are, Charles.
[02:50:34.699 --> 02:50:37.222]  See, I've tried to prove you wrong.
[02:50:37.222 --> 02:50:37.962]  I love you, Alex.
[02:50:37.962 --> 02:50:39.083]  I've been knowing you a long time.
[02:50:39.083 --> 02:50:40.645]  I've been calling in for like 10 years.
[02:50:41.411 --> 02:50:42.012]  Stay there!
[02:50:42.012 --> 02:50:42.352]  Stay there!
[02:51:01.909 --> 02:51:06.192]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:51:06.192 --> 02:51:09.455]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:51:09.455 --> 02:51:17.261]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:51:17.501 --> 02:51:19.742]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[02:51:19.742 --> 02:51:22.123]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:51:22.123 --> 02:51:28.946]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:51:28.946 --> 02:51:34.669]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:51:35.109 --> 02:51:37.711]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:51:37.711 --> 02:51:45.476]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[02:52:02.435 --> 02:52:06.462]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.462 --> 02:52:09.708]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.708 --> 02:52:11.131]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.818 --> 02:52:14.499]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.499 --> 02:52:20.900]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:26.442]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.442 --> 02:52:36.064]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.184 --> 02:52:38.526]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.526 --> 02:52:40.128]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.128 --> 02:52:42.590]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:44.712]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.712 --> 02:52:49.857]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.857 --> 02:52:58.986]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:02.181]  Attention!
[02:53:02.181 --> 02:53:17.539]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:53:17.539 --> 02:53:18.961]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silica
[02:53:20.503 --> 02:53:20.723]  I think so.
[02:53:43.939 --> 02:53:44.339]  I think so.
[02:54:12.941 --> 02:54:16.942]  Look, America has always been a sleeping giant.
[02:54:16.942 --> 02:54:18.403]  The establishment knows that.
[02:54:18.403 --> 02:54:21.843]  The social engineers, the architects of evil.
[02:54:21.843 --> 02:54:26.785]  And so they've built this control grid knowing we're going to wake up as a trap.
[02:54:26.785 --> 02:54:29.546]  But we've woken up more people than they thought we would.
[02:54:29.546 --> 02:54:31.306]  They're definitely getting concerned.
[02:54:31.306 --> 02:54:33.647]  They're having big problems on every front.
[02:54:33.647 --> 02:54:35.407]  We just can't see all our victories.
[02:54:35.407 --> 02:54:37.448]  So Charles, there are a lot of decadent men
[02:54:38.496 --> 02:54:41.900]  Who think that just watching football and acting tough is what a man is supposed to do?
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:45.825]  We have a lot of corrupt women in this country, but a lot of them are starting to wake up.
[02:54:45.825 --> 02:54:50.350]  And we've planted the seeds that won't sprout until they really get oppressed.
[02:54:50.350 --> 02:54:54.555]  And so that's the good news, Charles, and I want to salute you for all the work you've done over the years.
[02:54:54.555 --> 02:54:55.056]  Anything else?
[02:54:58.300 --> 02:54:59.781]  Anything else, Charles?
[02:54:59.781 --> 02:55:02.384]  People, we wouldn't even be where we are today.
[02:55:02.384 --> 02:55:03.685]  And they won't do nothing, Alex.
[02:55:03.685 --> 02:55:04.926]  They won't make tapes.
[02:55:04.926 --> 02:55:08.329]  They won't wake their neighbors up.
[02:55:08.329 --> 02:55:14.275]  I'm just sick of being American because we're celebrating communism.
[02:55:14.275 --> 02:55:17.918]  How does it make the soldiers feel wearing their uniform?
[02:55:17.918 --> 02:55:19.860]  Obama's just a puppet.
[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:22.762]  And we need to turn off Washington, D.C.
[02:55:22.762 --> 02:55:24.883]  and say, we don't recognize you no more.
[02:55:24.883 --> 02:55:27.205]  We need to do something, Alex.
[02:55:27.205 --> 02:55:27.585]  I agree.
[02:55:27.585 --> 02:55:32.429]  We should all send him emails and phone calls and registered letters saying, I don't recognize you.
[02:55:32.429 --> 02:55:33.990]  You're a criminal whore.
[02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:35.891]  Do something.
[02:55:35.891 --> 02:55:36.072]  Charles.
[02:55:36.072 --> 02:55:37.913]  Thank you, Alex, for the tapes.
[02:55:37.913 --> 02:55:42.236]  People think I'm just blowing smoke, but I woke up a lot of people with that.
[02:55:42.236 --> 02:55:45.959]  You know, we had just the last two weeks, two people died of the swine flu.
[02:55:45.959 --> 02:55:47.139]  Two friends of ours.
[02:55:47.139 --> 02:55:48.941]  Two people in one week, Alex.
[02:55:51.274 --> 02:55:56.776]  And people don't realize the seriousness until they're in prison or their kids are thirsty.
[02:55:56.776 --> 02:56:00.817]  Then they wake up all of a sudden, and it's too late.
[02:56:00.817 --> 02:56:04.278]  But the police came in and confiscated all the guns and still didn't get in trouble.
[02:56:04.278 --> 02:56:05.738]  Good to hear from you, Charles.
[02:56:05.738 --> 02:56:07.818]  Charles has been calling in for more than 10 years.
[02:56:07.818 --> 02:56:08.839]  Chris in Kentucky.
[02:56:08.839 --> 02:56:11.479]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:56:11.479 --> 02:56:13.240]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:13.560]  Hey buddy.
[02:56:14.187 --> 02:56:15.627]  Hey, thanks for bringing this in.
[02:56:15.627 --> 02:56:23.350]  Yeah, this swine flu deal with the media that you were playing the last hour is getting this way this morning on our local news area.
[02:56:23.350 --> 02:56:25.050]  They're saying they're running out of vaccinations.
[02:56:25.050 --> 02:56:26.231]  They're running out of vaccinations.
[02:56:26.231 --> 02:56:27.811]  You're going to die if you don't take it.
[02:56:27.811 --> 02:56:35.993]  Now the Jefferson County Public School System is going to get with the Health Department and go to all the schools and have talks getting your kids vaccinated.
[02:56:35.993 --> 02:56:41.455]  And they've been caught nationwide forcibly injecting children even when the parents say don't do it.
[02:56:42.455 --> 02:56:44.259]  Yep, and I believe that's coming here.
[02:56:44.259 --> 02:56:48.487]  And I'm going to call the radio station and I know we've got some...
[02:56:49.437 --> 02:56:55.920]  Well, what's even sicker is they won't tell people it's sunshine, vitamin D. They won't tell people that the nasal flu vaccine for H1N1 is what has now caused some of it to actually spread.
[02:57:16.491 --> 02:57:17.431]  They knew that.
[02:57:17.431 --> 02:57:19.192]  That's in the insert.
[02:57:19.192 --> 02:57:20.612]  That's in the insert.
[02:57:20.612 --> 02:57:24.053]  We've shown it here a hundred times or more the last month.
[02:57:24.053 --> 02:57:26.254]  Some shows five, six times.
[02:57:26.254 --> 02:57:27.834]  It's in the inserts.
[02:57:27.834 --> 02:57:34.056]  They know that they put out the nasal first so it would spread.
[02:57:34.056 --> 02:57:35.397]  How diabolical is that?
[02:57:35.397 --> 02:57:37.557]  Yeah, and it's incredible.
[02:57:37.557 --> 02:57:39.718]  And I want to go through some history of these vaccines.
[02:57:39.718 --> 02:57:42.439]  I've got some DVDs I found at a yard sale.
[02:57:42.975 --> 02:57:43.636]  Send those to me.
[02:57:43.636 --> 02:57:44.816]  I need that old propaganda.
[02:57:44.816 --> 02:57:48.859]  We played some of the old TV ads that would say, you're gonna die if you don't take it.
[02:57:48.859 --> 02:57:51.761]  And then they had to stop the shot because it was killing people.
[02:57:51.761 --> 02:57:51.982]  Exactly.
[02:57:51.982 --> 02:57:53.222]  And TV shows were doing that as well.
[02:58:09.955 --> 02:58:12.597]  It's total, total propaganda.
[02:58:12.597 --> 02:58:13.117]  God bless you.
[02:58:13.117 --> 02:58:13.938]  Good to hear from you, Chris.
[02:58:13.938 --> 02:58:16.299]  I'm going to talk to Jack, Mark, Mike, and Robert.
[02:58:16.299 --> 02:58:21.062]  Then our guests are going to be in studio at the Eight After, second segment, for the rest of the hour.
[02:58:21.062 --> 02:58:31.910]  Gary Franchi and, of course, William Lewis, makers of Camp FEMA, the DVD film that proves the FEMA camps, proves what's happening, documents them, all the rumors end.
[02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:34.151]  The documentation begins with Camp FEMA.
[02:58:34.151 --> 02:58:39.475]  You can get it discounted with Follow the Republic at InfoWars.com on DVD right now.
[02:58:39.475 --> 02:58:39.715]  Get it.
[02:58:41.316 --> 02:58:47.018]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.018 --> 02:58:50.240]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:52.071 --> 02:58:56.073]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.073 --> 02:58:59.314]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.314 --> 02:59:04.116]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.116 --> 02:59:10.519]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.519 --> 02:59:12.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:13.600]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:14.100]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:14.900]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.900 --> 02:59:16.061]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.061 --> 02:59:18.301]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.185 --> 02:59:34.326]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.326 --> 02:59:39.467]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.467 --> 02:59:53.872]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:53.872 --> 02:59:56.253]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.253 --> 02:59:58.954]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.656 --> 03:00:12.537]  How are you doing Alex Jones?
[03:00:12.537 --> 03:00:14.318]  I was just calling to let you know I love your movie very much.
[03:00:14.318 --> 03:00:16.079]  I had watched it just a couple days ago.
[03:00:16.079 --> 03:00:21.564]  I was just calling because I was just trying to let people know that I was trying to let you know that
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:54.070]  If we tell people, like when we give people something to fight for, something more than just like criticizing and doing all this and that, like we give them like a vision because life is supposed to be way better than it is right now, way easier.
[03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:55.451]  We're just getting held back by
[03:00:56.195 --> 03:00:58.216]  By the people in power?
[03:00:58.216 --> 03:00:59.977]  Well, we do give people the vision.
[03:00:59.977 --> 03:01:11.465]  It's the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, due process, get rid of the private banks, stop shipping narcotics in, stop pushing Ritalin and Prozac on our kids, stop killing us with your vaccines, stop putting poison in the water.
[03:01:11.465 --> 03:01:12.906]  That is a great vision.
[03:01:12.906 --> 03:01:17.769]  States' rights, sovereignty, ending all these stinking wars.
[03:01:17.769 --> 03:01:21.091]  Can I elaborate more on that, if you don't mind, sir?
[03:01:21.091 --> 03:01:21.912]  Go ahead.
[03:01:21.912 --> 03:01:22.612]  Huh?
[03:01:22.612 --> 03:01:25.714]  Like, people, like, the Chief keeps programming people to be selfish.
[03:01:26.195 --> 03:01:28.516]  Like, they care about themselves and not to care about kids.
[03:01:28.516 --> 03:01:33.878]  So when I said, like, something to fight for, like, for yourself, like, like, their life could be easier.
[03:01:33.878 --> 03:01:36.979]  Like, they couldn't, they wouldn't have to be going to work every day and stuff.
[03:01:36.979 --> 03:01:42.941]  Like, I really, I really see, like, life is supposed to be way better just because of the technology that we have and everything.
[03:01:42.941 --> 03:01:44.962]  Like, how much we're really getting held back.
[03:01:44.962 --> 03:01:45.982]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:01:45.982 --> 03:01:48.143]  It's like, it's like the people in power, right?
[03:01:48.143 --> 03:01:53.725]  They only give an effort, like, 0.1% out of 100 to try to, like, make life better and everything.
[03:01:53.725 --> 03:01:54.385]  And it's not hard.
[03:01:55.041 --> 03:02:01.945]  And they make it seem like it's hard to help people and to feed people and to, like, build up the whole world and everything.
[03:02:01.945 --> 03:02:09.008]  And they also have people confined into thinking that Earth is, what's it called, that Earth is where all the resources are.
[03:02:09.008 --> 03:02:13.751]  You just look up in the sky and space and Mars and all these other places and asteroids floating all around the place.
[03:02:14.127 --> 03:02:19.632]  People living in space, right now, gathering all the stuff we will, not us, but robots, you know what I'm saying?
[03:02:19.632 --> 03:02:21.033]  Like, out there gathering resources.
[03:02:21.033 --> 03:02:21.353]  Good day, Alex.
[03:02:37.324 --> 03:02:43.587]  Hey Alex, I just asked Charlie, you know, I really admire his spirit and his heart and his Christianity.
[03:02:43.587 --> 03:02:59.033]  I think it's all real and genuine and his patriotism is right on the money, but just to take a little bit of heart in the fact that when people talk, when they communicate, that's really the first step in my view toward implementing resistance of various types.
[03:02:59.033 --> 03:02:59.994]  But I just wanted to mention that.
[03:02:59.994 --> 03:03:01.194]  You're talking about Charles?
[03:03:01.194 --> 03:03:02.355]  Charles, the earlier caller?
[03:03:02.355 --> 03:03:03.815]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:03.815 --> 03:03:05.076]  And I just wanted to mention that.
[03:03:05.509 --> 03:03:29.960]  But Alex, you know, as we heard in the CFR conference recording that you gave us, these CFR speakers were either nervously chattering and chuckling because their plans to implement a world pandemic may be seriously faltering, or perhaps because they know that around the world, very lethal and various biowarfare viruses have recently been and are currently being intentionally released.
[03:03:30.686 --> 03:03:39.834]  And now they've shown up in the Ukraine with an Ebola-type virus, which is widespread there and seems to be quite a serious situation from what I've heard.
[03:03:39.834 --> 03:03:55.249]  If this planned global flu pandemic doesn't succeed, by the grace of God, it will cost the Illuminati dearly in their ability to implement their agenda because their true plans to destroy humanity are now fully known and exposed to a majority of the world's people, Alex.
[03:03:56.058 --> 03:04:02.502]  You play a tremendous part in it, brother, and I'll just do everything I can in my small way to contribute, but God bless you, sir.
[03:04:02.502 --> 03:04:04.223]  Well, God bless you, and I appreciate your call.
[03:04:04.223 --> 03:04:17.112]  Yes, the UN has been caught, CBS News, Associated Press, they report it like it's no big deal, injecting people with live, weaponized, mutated polio.
[03:04:18.186 --> 03:04:21.707]  And the UN's been caught releasing the Ebola and sterilizing people.
[03:04:21.707 --> 03:04:26.028]  And in Ukraine, there's all these weird deaths of some other super virus.
[03:04:26.028 --> 03:04:31.269]  Government is behind this 99% of the time.
[03:04:31.269 --> 03:04:33.829]  Their eugenicists, they talk about using bio-weapons.
[03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:45.192]  Dick Cheney, in the September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses, Projects for a New American Century document, talks about killing certain races with race-specific bio-weapons and how that use needs to be legitimized.
[03:04:46.417 --> 03:04:46.978]  We're good to go.
[03:05:01.397 --> 03:05:09.943]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:05:09.943 --> 03:05:13.326]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:05:13.326 --> 03:05:19.190]  Instead, use Vitamin C-D and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife, for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:23.974]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:05:23.974 --> 03:05:26.316]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:05:26.476 --> 03:05:26.916]  Thank you.
[03:05:45.407 --> 03:05:49.132]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[03:05:49.132 --> 03:05:51.335]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.
[03:05:51.335 --> 03:05:56.322]  Or call about OxySilver, ZO Life, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:05:56.322 --> 03:05:57.844]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:05:57.844 --> 03:05:58.325]  Do it now.
[03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:04.362]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.362 --> 03:06:09.706]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.706 --> 03:06:11.748]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.748 --> 03:06:16.751]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.751 --> 03:06:17.672]  How much do you want?
[03:06:17.932 --> 03:06:19.053]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.053 --> 03:06:20.935]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:20.935 --> 03:06:22.015]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.015 --> 03:06:24.217]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.217 --> 03:06:25.558]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.558 --> 03:06:27.080]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:32.364]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.364 --> 03:06:35.947]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:35.947 --> 03:06:39.410]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:40.971]  How much will you need?
[03:06:40.971 --> 03:06:41.871]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.871 --> 03:06:42.991]  How much do you want?
[03:06:42.991 --> 03:06:43.912]  All you can get.
[03:06:43.912 --> 03:06:45.012]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.012 --> 03:06:48.054]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.054 --> 03:06:49.834]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:49.834 --> 03:06:50.755]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.299 --> 03:07:04.405]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:07:04.405 --> 03:07:07.288]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:07:07.288 --> 03:07:09.371]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:07:09.371 --> 03:07:11.634]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:07:11.634 --> 03:07:13.276]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:07:13.276 --> 03:07:17.582]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:07:31.112 --> 03:07:33.934]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:07:33.934 --> 03:07:36.656]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:07:36.656 --> 03:07:43.822]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[03:07:52.909 --> 03:08:01.716]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:08:01.716 --> 03:08:07.260]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:08.703 --> 03:08:10.363]  We've got 52 minutes left.
[03:08:10.363 --> 03:08:14.684]  I want to jam in a lot of news, talk to our guests, and take your phone calls.
[03:08:14.684 --> 03:08:17.845]  We've got Ron Paul coming up Thursday with key information.
[03:08:17.845 --> 03:08:26.627]  Other surprise guests on Friday, and General Stubblebine and Dr. Lima-Layboe tomorrow.
[03:08:26.627 --> 03:08:30.428]  Very important information, breaking news there as well.
[03:08:32.139 --> 03:08:41.808]  I cannot overemphasize how outrageous it is that the New York Times did a big exclusive telling the world what we've known for many years.
[03:08:41.808 --> 03:08:48.934]  That Al Gore, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and a handful of other elitists are standing to make hundreds of billions a year.
[03:08:48.934 --> 03:08:50.516]  Billions a year for Al Gore.
[03:08:50.516 --> 03:08:56.041]  He owns the main carbon trading group that the UN treaty says you've got to buy your carbon credits from.
[03:08:57.068 --> 03:08:58.729]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:08:58.729 --> 03:09:00.409]  They will decide what business you can have.
[03:09:00.409 --> 03:09:01.510]  They will decide.
[03:09:01.510 --> 03:09:02.490]  I covered the treaty yesterday.
[03:09:02.490 --> 03:09:04.111]  I'm going to do more of this this week.
[03:09:04.111 --> 03:09:07.472]  Somewhere in my stack, I had the ledger.
[03:09:07.472 --> 03:09:11.574]  We created a glossary for this so we could go through it all.
[03:09:11.574 --> 03:09:14.475]  And I was going to go back over it today, but I couldn't find the glossary this morning.
[03:09:14.475 --> 03:09:16.996]  I may have Burmese who made it make another one.
[03:09:16.996 --> 03:09:22.378]  But I may just reread it, though, because I was looking over it again and found a bunch of other even worse stuff just randomly.
[03:09:22.378 --> 03:09:23.258]  It's looking at the 200 plus pages.
[03:09:25.086 --> 03:09:33.552]  All of this is going on, and they have now passed it in the House, it's out of the Senate, out of the Senate committee to the full Senate.
[03:09:33.552 --> 03:09:35.053]  This is happening now.
[03:09:35.053 --> 03:09:47.282]  So is the bank re-regulation to give this select group of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, the Federal Reserve private owners, unlimited regulatory power of everyone else.
[03:09:47.282 --> 03:09:52.265]  This on the heels, we've got surprise guests on this coming up this week, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:56.964]  This on the heels, how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:09:56.964 --> 03:10:00.146]  housing crash and how they engineered it.
[03:10:00.146 --> 03:10:01.728]  This is in McClatchy newspapers.
[03:10:01.728 --> 03:10:03.169]  Hundreds of newspapers ran this.
[03:10:03.169 --> 03:10:08.975]  This is a top financial investigative reporter, formerly with the New York Times, Greg Gordon.
[03:10:09.861 --> 03:10:24.267]  Their own internal memos, how they did it all by design to make their competition go bankrupt, and the documents mention Bear Stearns, who was actually solvent, but Goldman Sachs former executives were the regulators that went and took over the other banks and brokerage firms.
[03:10:24.267 --> 03:10:26.148]  This is unprecedented!
[03:10:27.611 --> 03:10:35.476]  Either we let the criminals continue to commit more crimes, it emboldens them to do more, or we wake up as a society, audit the Fed, arrest the bastards.
[03:10:35.476 --> 03:10:40.960]  Ron Paul said last time he was here, or it was two times ago, he said, yes, we shouldn't have them indicted by state grand juries.
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:42.641]  They've clearly committed crimes.
[03:10:42.641 --> 03:10:49.726]  But instead, they've got all the trillions in fiat money they've raised off our taxpayer backs, so the police just bow down to anybody in a suit.
[03:10:51.707 --> 03:10:53.368]  I want to play this Al Gore clip.
[03:10:53.368 --> 03:11:11.433]  This is Al Gore being discussed on Morning Joe, where they reveal for the first time to the world, though I cover it in the Obama deception and Fall of the Republic, that he runs all the major carbon scams and Al Gore's got minions like Obama, who owns a large portion of one of the groups.
[03:11:11.433 --> 03:11:13.234]  But the New York Times says this is good.
[03:11:13.234 --> 03:11:14.794]  He's being rewarded for his good work.
[03:11:14.794 --> 03:11:19.015]  And yeah, Ken Lay did write up the plan in 1998, but Ken Lay, he's not bad.
[03:11:21.650 --> 03:11:26.758]  Got caught triple-charging people for energy prices in California and other states.
[03:11:26.758 --> 03:11:29.822]  So, more reasons to get full of the Republic, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:29.822 --> 03:11:33.288]  People are now ready to see this.
[03:11:33.288 --> 03:11:33.949]  Here's Al Gore.
[03:11:35.424 --> 03:11:36.065]  We're good.
[03:11:53.427 --> 03:12:02.672]  Well, no, of course I invest according to my beliefs and values and I encourage everybody to do the same thing.
[03:12:02.672 --> 03:12:04.653]  I put my money where my mouth is.
[03:12:04.653 --> 03:12:09.475]  I've advocated these same policies for more than 30 years and of course I believe in it.
[03:12:09.475 --> 03:12:16.058]  If I didn't, they would criticize me for being a hypocrite.
[03:12:16.058 --> 03:12:22.702]  Okay, we are back live here and I just wanted to play that clip of these arrogant creatures
[03:12:23.447 --> 03:12:25.769]  And it's all a big joke to them.
[03:12:25.769 --> 03:12:29.632]  We have Gary Franchi of Restore the Republic.
[03:12:29.632 --> 03:12:33.435]  And we have, of course, both the makers.
[03:12:33.435 --> 03:12:34.656]  You're one of the producers.
[03:12:34.656 --> 03:12:38.179]  There's also the director, William Lewis, here with us.
[03:12:38.179 --> 03:12:39.721]  And we are carrying Camp FEMA.
[03:12:39.721 --> 03:12:40.842]  I did consult on it.
[03:12:40.842 --> 03:12:41.222]  I'm in it.
[03:12:42.691 --> 03:12:44.312]  This is the truth about FEMA camps.
[03:12:44.312 --> 03:12:46.613]  They're here to interview me for part two.
[03:12:46.613 --> 03:12:51.716]  Everybody should get it at Infowars.com and you can get the films discounted when you get it with Fall of the Republic.
[03:12:51.716 --> 03:12:53.236]  Again, I just want these out.
[03:12:53.236 --> 03:13:00.340]  Instead of always talking blue in the face about FEMA camps and everybody spreading rumors, you've got a film you can give people.
[03:13:00.340 --> 03:13:02.341]  You want a film about the carbon tax.
[03:13:02.341 --> 03:13:04.682]  You want a film about the banking architecture.
[03:13:04.682 --> 03:13:06.063]  You want a film about the New World Order.
[03:13:07.244 --> 03:13:09.245]  William Lewis, good to see you.
[03:13:31.223 --> 03:13:31.683]  Good to see you.
[03:13:31.683 --> 03:13:41.412]  Okay, guys, I want to get into Camp FEMA and the new one you're making and all this, but first, they have now marked up, out of committee, they can vote on this anytime, the cap-and-trade bill.
[03:13:42.646 --> 03:13:42.906]  I think?
[03:14:05.399 --> 03:14:07.020]  That, you know, what really happened.
[03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:12.665]  But they wouldn't be attacking little ol' Alex Jones if I wasn't telling the truth and if they weren't scared.
[03:14:12.665 --> 03:14:18.670]  And scared of the work the Republic's doing, scared of all the films you've made, scared of other people learning they can do the same thing.
[03:14:18.670 --> 03:14:21.332]  But what do you just think of how everything's happening right now?
[03:14:21.332 --> 03:14:31.660]  The banking takeover, the cap and trade, the federalization hate crimes bill, the open borders, the gun grabbing, the open, I mean, the plunging dollar, gold up at $1,090 an ounce.
[03:14:31.660 --> 03:14:32.321]  I mean, it's insane.
[03:14:35.248 --> 03:14:35.328]  Is
[03:14:55.390 --> 03:15:01.732]  They're kind of sick of these small incremental steps they've been making all these years.
[03:15:01.732 --> 03:15:03.133]  They want to see.
[03:15:03.133 --> 03:15:03.893]  They want to live.
[03:15:03.893 --> 03:15:05.173]  David Rockefeller is 94.
[03:15:05.173 --> 03:15:05.553]  Kissinger is 87.
[03:15:05.553 --> 03:15:06.694]  They want it and they want it now.
[03:15:11.298 --> 03:15:11.678]  Exactly.
[03:15:11.678 --> 03:15:20.003]  I mean, this is, we really have watched over the past 20 or so years all of the little bits and pieces of these things being put into place.
[03:15:20.003 --> 03:15:23.805]  I mean, it's not as if all of this just happened all at once.
[03:15:23.805 --> 03:15:26.707]  We've been trying to warn the American people what's coming.
[03:15:26.707 --> 03:15:28.128]  They like shitting on their thumb.
[03:15:28.308 --> 03:15:36.050]  You've predicted a lot of the things that have happened, and now it's easier for people to be able to put this little puzzle piece together and see the big picture.
[03:15:36.050 --> 03:15:37.091]  And that's what we're seeing now.
[03:15:37.091 --> 03:15:38.231]  Our eyes are open.
[03:15:38.231 --> 03:15:43.172]  People can see what's going on, and now's the time that we have to use to take action.
[03:15:43.172 --> 03:15:45.413]  I mean, I'm legitimately losing sleep.
[03:15:45.413 --> 03:15:47.414]  I mean, I know these people are eugenicists.
[03:15:47.414 --> 03:15:51.615]  I know they put stuff in our water and brag about it in White House publications.
[03:15:51.615 --> 03:15:54.736]  I know they're dangerous, and
[03:15:55.868 --> 03:15:59.172]  People are finally figuring it out, but I don't think they realize how dangerous.
[03:15:59.172 --> 03:16:08.081]  I don't think they're going to realize how dangerous it is until they're in that hospital room and they've got a doctor bearing down on them with a shot that they're being forced to take.
[03:16:08.081 --> 03:16:14.248]  You know, it's going to come when, the realization is going to come when they have to make that decision when the force hits them.
[03:16:14.248 --> 03:16:17.452]  Hell, Austin federally is taking blood without warrants now.
[03:16:18.584 --> 03:16:19.685]  I mean, it's already bearing down.
[03:16:19.685 --> 03:16:20.505]  Go ahead.
[03:16:20.505 --> 03:16:23.166]  Well, I mean, that's what I'm saying, you know.
[03:16:23.166 --> 03:16:28.149]  When it comes to a head, when the people have to make that decision at that moment, it's when they're going to react.
[03:16:28.149 --> 03:16:39.134]  And that's our job, is to explain to them the real ballgame, so when that decision finally faces them, all the denial's stripped away, and we're dealing with the real deal.
[03:16:39.134 --> 03:16:41.375]  Absolutely.
[03:16:41.375 --> 03:16:48.219]  Like I said, when they have to make that decision, we are getting to them before that point, so they can make that informed decision.
[03:16:50.677 --> 03:16:58.887]  Well, the good news is people are waking up, but I mean, the problem is it took me on air 14 years, six, seven, eight years to really get knowledge, studying constantly.
[03:16:58.887 --> 03:17:01.771]  So people are waking up, but they don't have a master's degree in it yet.
[03:17:01.771 --> 03:17:05.496]  And that's why films are so important, because they can give you a crash course.
[03:17:06.570 --> 03:17:08.392]  All of your films gave me a crash course.
[03:17:08.392 --> 03:17:13.696]  I downloaded them all off the internet, and I watched them in my house.
[03:17:13.696 --> 03:17:15.097]  I woke up that day.
[03:17:15.097 --> 03:17:20.502]  I saw probably every one of your movies within a whole day woke me up like that, and I took action.
[03:17:20.502 --> 03:17:21.943]  That's what Charlie Sheen said.
[03:17:21.943 --> 03:17:28.889]  Emilio Estevedo's brother came over and had bought all my films, and they stayed up all weekend drinking coffee and watched like 15 of them.
[03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:30.429]  Oh, it changed my life.
[03:17:30.429 --> 03:17:39.032]  And that's when I said, I have to make a decision, I'm going to step up and do something, and I'm going to get people together who have seen these films, and let's take action together.
[03:17:39.032 --> 03:17:41.232]  It was because I saw your movies, Alex.
[03:17:41.232 --> 03:17:44.033]  Well, you've done a great job with all your work, and it's another testament to that.
[03:17:44.033 --> 03:17:46.634]  And again, we're not bragging, oh look at the work we've done.
[03:17:46.634 --> 03:17:51.495]  The point is, you can defeat these people if you take action.
[03:17:51.495 --> 03:17:55.576]  If people will just get involved, even if you wake one person up, that's huge.
[03:17:56.394 --> 03:17:58.456]  Bill, there's all different ways to take action.
[03:17:58.456 --> 03:18:04.901]  I mean, taking action is showing a movie to a friend or someone who was not exposed to this information.
[03:18:04.901 --> 03:18:10.565]  Taking action is renting out a theater and showing it to 30 people at one time who haven't seen this information.
[03:18:10.565 --> 03:18:14.528]  I mean, there's so many different ways to get involved in your local government.
[03:18:14.528 --> 03:18:16.490]  Getting people elected as sheriffs.
[03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:20.573]  This thing can't succeed if it is exposed.
[03:18:20.573 --> 03:18:20.893]  Yeah.
[03:18:23.638 --> 03:18:29.221]  People may think that they're insignificant, just like they think that their vote doesn't count, which it doesn't, in case you didn't know that.
[03:18:29.221 --> 03:18:37.546]  But the point here is that they think that their action within this movement doesn't necessarily hold much weight.
[03:18:37.546 --> 03:18:46.211]  You know, it's hard for them to wait for a year or two years or three years to see the fruit of their labor, because it takes a while for the information to get out.
[03:18:46.211 --> 03:18:48.392]  It takes a while to organize, do something.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:53.844]  Well, that's one thing that makes me nervous is that I think we're really primed for another false flag event that could
[03:19:10.919 --> 03:19:14.021]  Really bust the momentum that we have right now.
[03:19:14.021 --> 03:19:15.662]  It's really a matter of time, Alex.
[03:19:15.662 --> 03:19:22.285]  But we preemptively have exposed false flag terror, and so it's hard for them to play that card, but I agree, they're gonna play it.
[03:19:22.285 --> 03:19:31.270]  Well, yeah, we know the symptoms, we know the signs, we know what to look for, so that we can raise those red flags before they happen, hopefully, and preempt anything.
[03:19:31.270 --> 03:19:38.313]  And all these fake terror busts they've been doing, which have turned out to be fake in every case, that's a sign they are really getting ready to do it.
[03:19:38.313 --> 03:19:39.114]  Plus, they've got...
[03:19:40.154 --> 03:19:45.280]  They need to look, in the public's eyes, they need to make the public feel like they're accomplishing something.
[03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:46.662]  And that's why they pulled these.
[03:19:46.662 --> 03:19:48.244]  They're protecting us.
[03:19:48.244 --> 03:19:56.673]  Let's look at the architecture of the FEMA camps when we get back and how a false flag can be used, whether it's financial or terror or biological.
[03:19:56.673 --> 03:19:59.216]  What's coming up with our guest and more of your calls.
[03:19:59.216 --> 03:19:59.697]  Stay with us.

[03:22:02.466 --> 03:22:06.151]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.151 --> 03:22:09.737]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:09.737 --> 03:22:11.159]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:22:11.866 --> 03:22:14.549]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.549 --> 03:22:20.935]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:20.935 --> 03:22:26.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:36.129]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:38.570]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:40.151]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.151 --> 03:22:42.612]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.612 --> 03:22:44.754]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.754 --> 03:22:49.896]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:49.896 --> 03:22:54.899]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:23:08.530 --> 03:23:10.631]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.

[03:23:53.527 --> 03:24:21.637]  I hear the train a-blowin' I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine Since I don't know when Stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' Here it is, Camp FEMA ladies and gentlemen
[03:24:23.038 --> 03:24:24.120]  American Lockdown.
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:25.361]  You want the truth?
[03:24:25.361 --> 03:24:26.263]  Infowars.com.
[03:24:26.263 --> 03:24:29.587]  Get yourself a copy while you're getting fall of the Republican endgame.
[03:24:29.587 --> 03:24:31.270]  These films are so important.
[03:24:31.270 --> 03:24:34.034]  These are the key to really reaching the most people.
[03:24:34.034 --> 03:24:37.178]  They get a full education and an entertaining package.
[03:24:37.178 --> 03:24:38.440]  By entertaining, they'll be riveted.
[03:24:39.651 --> 03:24:45.155]  Okay, we have the makers of Camp FEMA, the director and the producer, Gary Franchi, here with us, and William Lewis.
[03:24:45.155 --> 03:24:47.737]  Okay, guys, false flag terror.
[03:24:47.737 --> 03:24:49.099]  They clearly need their agenda.
[03:24:49.099 --> 03:24:50.059]  They need a new war.
[03:24:50.059 --> 03:24:53.162]  The RAND Corporation says the false flag could be World War III.
[03:24:53.162 --> 03:24:57.205]  All of our insiders are saying within two years, massive war.
[03:24:57.205 --> 03:25:01.889]  It could be in South America against Venezuela and in Central Asia and in the Middle East.
[03:25:02.549 --> 03:25:05.691]  Domestic stage terror attacks, bioweapons releases.
[03:25:05.691 --> 03:25:08.873]  I believe this is all just a drill to test the federal assets.
[03:25:08.873 --> 03:25:11.555]  Their test isn't going well.
[03:25:11.555 --> 03:25:13.576]  What do you see happening?
[03:25:13.576 --> 03:25:16.819]  I see a lot of people saying, I don't want to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:25:16.819 --> 03:25:24.604]  You know, I was watching news reports last night and some of the local stations are reporting, you know, local opinions.
[03:25:24.604 --> 03:25:30.328]  And there are men and women and children saying, I'm not going to take this untested vaccine and I don't want my children to take it.
[03:25:31.334 --> 03:25:46.887]  You know, if that's the particular false flag operation that they choose to use for martial law, then I think it probably is going to work, because there's enough people saying no right now where I think that they would be able to call it more than a national emergency.
[03:25:46.887 --> 03:25:53.333]  I mean, look at the... They've called it a national emergency, and they're also forcing kids to take it to schools illegally under orders.
[03:25:53.333 --> 03:25:54.174]  That is bullish!
[03:25:55.365 --> 03:26:07.896]  Have you looked into the, under a national emergency, what regulations are suspended at hospitals for the national emergency and, you know, a medical emergency?
[03:26:07.896 --> 03:26:18.585]  It makes you wonder because I'm looking at news reports, they're saying that they don't have to record your name or your information or take as much information about you in order to process you through and get you the shot quicker.
[03:26:19.125 --> 03:26:26.487]  So that kind of, that opens up the door now to, well if they don't have to do that at hospitals, maybe it's more convenient for us to send out people in suits and ties to your door.
[03:26:26.487 --> 03:26:28.188]  No, no, no, that's already going on.
[03:26:28.188 --> 03:26:36.370]  They're already sending letters to people saying your kids haven't been vaccinated and people are showing up saying I'm from the National Health Registry in weird scrubby uniforms.
[03:26:36.370 --> 03:26:39.671]  We got calls about that the last three months and then saw it in the news.
[03:26:40.882 --> 03:26:55.085]  Well, you know, we could talk about the swine flu in a shot, but what really concerns me is another type of a domestic terror attack, like in Oklahoma City, where they blame, you know, a Constitution-loving patriot.
[03:26:55.085 --> 03:26:58.506]  Because behind the scenes, it's not Al-Qaeda they're scaring the cops with.
[03:26:58.506 --> 03:26:59.847]  It is the patriots.
[03:26:59.847 --> 03:27:01.047]  We're the main threat.
[03:27:01.047 --> 03:27:09.369]  Right, and that's what's going to give them the excuse to round up people like myself, people like you, people like William, people who are in this movement.
[03:27:10.129 --> 03:27:12.250]  That's, I mean, that's my biggest concern.
[03:27:12.250 --> 03:27:14.311]  But a lot of insiders say they don't want to do that.
[03:27:14.311 --> 03:27:15.551]  They may just shut the web off.
[03:27:15.551 --> 03:27:19.893]  What did you think two weeks ago when Obama said, yeah, the NSA is taking over the web.
[03:27:19.893 --> 03:27:25.475]  During emergencies like swine flu, we may shut all websites off, but government for your safety.
[03:27:25.475 --> 03:27:28.416]  I mean, that that's that's openly being announced.
[03:27:28.416 --> 03:27:29.876]  That's not for your safety.
[03:27:29.876 --> 03:27:31.297]  But I mean, exactly.
[03:27:31.297 --> 03:27:34.178]  But I'm saying to have them openly breaking the ice.
[03:27:35.208 --> 03:27:37.949]  See, they're really getting ready for this.
[03:27:37.949 --> 03:27:39.670]  Well, it's all a series of tests.
[03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:44.673]  They test to see how the public is going to respond to these actions.
[03:27:44.673 --> 03:27:51.016]  And if they don't get serious outcry or anything like that, then they may hold back on how they react.
[03:27:51.016 --> 03:27:55.198]  But then they've always got five or six other operations simultaneously running.
[03:27:55.478 --> 03:27:56.579]  It's all a sigh of relief.
[03:28:07.555 --> 03:28:08.996]  Everybody's TV and cable?
[03:28:08.996 --> 03:28:10.598]  Because there's still information coming out.
[03:28:10.598 --> 03:28:12.279]  So whose information is more credible?
[03:28:12.279 --> 03:28:15.622]  Apparently the information they're getting on the internet is a little more credible because they don't want you to get it.
[03:28:15.622 --> 03:28:17.064]  Well, it'll be corporate control.
[03:28:17.064 --> 03:28:20.927]  They hand out the talking points to the mainstream media and say, this is what you can report on.
[03:28:20.927 --> 03:28:21.828]  They leave, they leave.
[03:28:21.828 --> 03:28:23.009]  And that's admitted now.
[03:28:23.009 --> 03:28:26.993]  Almost all movies and TV shows are completely written by the government.
[03:28:26.993 --> 03:28:32.598]  The FBI wrote most of the X-Files, or they were at least involved in
[03:28:33.226 --> 03:28:51.232]  I've had the star of the X-Files, Dean Hagelin, show up at my house, do an interview and say, yeah, the CIA told us what to produce and told us that lone gunman episode where the government hijacks a jet to fly it in the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan and uses a drill to make NORAD stand out.
[03:28:51.232 --> 03:28:52.292]  Who are these people?
[03:28:52.292 --> 03:28:56.254]  Why are they so sick that they like to see it on TV what they're going to do to us?
[03:28:56.254 --> 03:28:57.594]  It's not that they like to see it on TV.
[03:28:57.594 --> 03:29:00.115]  What they're doing is they're putting it out there so that when you
[03:29:01.292 --> 03:29:04.594]  Talk to your audience and tell them some of these wild, fascinating stories.
[03:29:04.594 --> 03:29:06.576]  People are going to go, hey man, you've been watching too much X-Files.
[03:29:06.576 --> 03:29:07.096]  You know what?
[03:29:07.096 --> 03:29:16.402]  I probably get, no exaggeration, when I go five emails a day or more, and I see it all over YouTube comments going, Alex got all his news from Metal Gear Solid.
[03:29:16.402 --> 03:29:18.423]  I don't know what Metal Gear Solid is.
[03:29:18.423 --> 03:29:20.445]  It's supposedly some combat game.
[03:29:20.445 --> 03:29:21.065]  Yeah, combat game.
[03:29:21.065 --> 03:29:22.266]  I've seen the cover.
[03:29:22.266 --> 03:29:26.068]  No, that's them putting what's really going on in the game.
[03:29:26.068 --> 03:29:28.030]  Metal Gear Solid is this.
[03:29:30.868 --> 03:29:31.328]  What is it?
[03:29:31.328 --> 03:29:32.308]  I guess it's some combat game?
[03:29:32.308 --> 03:29:33.609]  It's a video game.
[03:29:33.609 --> 03:29:36.590]  You're running off to shoot people.
[03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:41.011]  What they say when I talk about population reduction, that's a Metal Gear Solid.
[03:29:41.011 --> 03:29:51.535]  I never play the game, but most of these games have a timeline, a storyline, and a whole... When I talk about New World Order, they think I'm talking about the WWF, but... That was definitely planned.
[03:29:51.535 --> 03:29:52.935]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.935 --> 03:29:55.476]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.476 --> 03:29:58.157]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.925 --> 03:30:06.231]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.231 --> 03:30:10.776]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.776 --> 03:30:13.039]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.039 --> 03:30:14.661]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.661 --> 03:30:15.702]  There is a solution.
[03:30:15.922 --> 03:30:24.350]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:30:24.350 --> 03:30:31.817]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:31:00.816 --> 03:31:09.963]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:09.963 --> 03:31:13.346]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.346 --> 03:31:19.210]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:31:19.210 --> 03:31:23.994]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:31:23.994 --> 03:31:26.336]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:31:26.616 --> 03:31:26.976]  I'm good.
[03:31:45.441 --> 03:31:49.145]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.

[03:33:09.387 --> 03:33:17.209]  Mike, Robert, Mandy, Rick, and the Bahamas, who disagrees, we'll let him first, and then Brian in Montreal.
[03:33:17.209 --> 03:33:20.790]  Before this show ends, we'll take your calls.
[03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:23.411]  I wanted to show you this.
[03:33:25.177 --> 03:33:29.158]  National Reconnaissance Office, United States of America.
[03:33:29.158 --> 03:33:33.839]  We got sent from the address saying, you know, not all of us are asleep.
[03:33:33.839 --> 03:33:36.559]  Death of New World Order, long live the Republic.
[03:33:36.559 --> 03:33:43.140]  A Defense Intelligence Agency patch, mailed from the Defense Intelligence Agency, with nothing else on it.
[03:33:43.140 --> 03:33:46.241]  This one here says, National Reconnaissance Office, United States of America.
[03:33:46.241 --> 03:33:51.782]  On the back, it says, Central Intelligence Agency, nowhere to hide.
[03:33:53.240 --> 03:34:00.765]  Yeah, well there's nowhere to hide when you violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and help the government ship the narcotics in and interdict people that don't pay their cut.
[03:34:00.765 --> 03:34:05.027]  There's nowhere to hide from God for the crimes that you've been committing.
[03:34:05.027 --> 03:34:08.389]  Oh yeah, I guess we need headphones to be able to take calls with you guys.
[03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:09.090]  That's a good point.
[03:34:09.090 --> 03:34:10.070]  I should have thought of that earlier.
[03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.811]  We're getting them hooked up.
[03:34:10.811 --> 03:34:12.952]  Good job, guys.
[03:34:12.952 --> 03:34:17.055]  You know, for three days, I've been meaning to play this clip.
[03:34:18.129 --> 03:34:42.447]  As just an example of how they've got people into false reality and into simulations, not just sports, and all these mass game, video games, where millions of people, sometimes millions, sometimes hundreds of thousands, and one of them's called Eve, and it's some intergalactic battle deal with humans from different corporations fighting each other, and on this front page of the site, I saw the ad on YouTube, it said, your life will matter.
[03:34:42.447 --> 03:34:43.988]  You actually affect this universe.
[03:34:44.488 --> 03:34:44.588]  Well,
[03:35:12.305 --> 03:35:14.227]  It's all a PSYOP game.
[03:35:14.227 --> 03:35:17.469]  They plant these seeds into your subconscious.
[03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:25.174]  So like as William mentioned, when you bring it up in public, it's easy to discredit, but it also, in your mind, you've already heard it.
[03:35:25.174 --> 03:35:26.255]  You've heard it somewhere before.
[03:35:26.255 --> 03:35:27.156]  You're comfortable with it.
[03:35:27.156 --> 03:35:29.037]  Comfortable with it.
[03:35:29.037 --> 03:35:30.518]  You've been acclimated.
[03:35:30.518 --> 03:35:32.720]  Desensitized is the word, yes.
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:35.121]  Gall-lighted.
[03:35:35.121 --> 03:35:36.202]  You had the ground prepared.
[03:35:36.202 --> 03:35:39.044]  I mean, I watched Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen.
[03:35:40.612 --> 03:35:53.805]  You saw it last... And the whole thing is torture's good, tasering's good, burning people's eyes out to get answers is good, the military's perfect, you're being face scanned for your own safety, total surveillance is good, the fam... Other than that, that movie's a total waste of time, man.
[03:35:53.805 --> 03:36:00.391]  When I saw the movie, there was a character in the film who had this huge computer setup... The conspiracy theorists are crazy and bad!
[03:36:00.391 --> 03:36:03.935]  I'm like, wow, those sounds... But the good guy tells them to lie for America!
[03:36:04.375 --> 03:36:05.216]  Right.
[03:36:05.216 --> 03:36:11.380]  When that conspiracy theorist was talking, I'm like, wow, he's saying a lot of things I've said before, you know?
[03:36:11.380 --> 03:36:19.507]  Yeah, but other than that, it's a lot of Transformers transforming from a car back into a Transformer, back into whatever.
[03:36:19.507 --> 03:36:21.728]  And I mean, most of the movie is nothing but special effects.
[03:36:21.728 --> 03:36:25.351]  There's very little, there's no relationship.
[03:36:25.351 --> 03:36:27.293]  But it's not bad when you're jogging.
[03:36:27.293 --> 03:36:30.455]  If I try to jog like down the street, I can go like a mile.
[03:36:30.455 --> 03:36:33.818]  But if I put on a movie and get into it, I can get three miles, four miles in.
[03:36:35.157 --> 03:36:35.297]  Well...
[03:36:49.005 --> 03:36:52.927]  Well, you know, it's not necessarily always the CIA or some government agency.
[03:36:52.927 --> 03:36:54.508]  No, but big productions are!
[03:36:54.508 --> 03:37:01.112]  Yeah, I do agree with you on some of those, but I think it's just so ingrained in our culture.
[03:37:01.112 --> 03:37:02.553]  This is what we're being prepared for.
[03:37:02.553 --> 03:37:03.774]  This is what people are thinking about.
[03:37:03.774 --> 03:37:06.015]  It's on their minds, it's in their conscience, and they're writing about it.
[03:37:06.155 --> 03:37:20.165]  Sure, we're driving that by exposing it, and I've talked to a lot of directors, but they may have four or five top stars in their film, and the film costs $9 million, and they make $15 million, and it should be a big hit, and I've talked to direct... Okay, Richard Linklater.
[03:37:20.165 --> 03:37:20.846]  He's making...
[03:37:22.562 --> 03:37:26.145]  Scanner Darkly, Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Woody Harrelson, and a bunch of other people in it.
[03:37:26.145 --> 03:37:26.666]  I'm in it.
[03:37:26.666 --> 03:37:28.127]  I consulted on it.
[03:37:28.127 --> 03:37:32.270]  And he had final cut, but they went like a half million dollars over.
[03:37:32.270 --> 03:37:37.895]  So then, that was Warner Brothers, came in and said, okay, you're going to cut all these scenes.
[03:37:37.895 --> 03:37:39.896]  You're going to cut where the cop blows the guy's head off.
[03:37:39.896 --> 03:37:41.377]  That's anti-law enforcement.
[03:37:41.377 --> 03:37:45.921]  Now let me tell you, and Linklater fought him and kept it in, because it was in the book.
[03:37:45.921 --> 03:37:49.484]  But the point is, is there is control.
[03:37:49.484 --> 03:37:50.425]  There is control.
[03:37:51.676 --> 03:37:53.078]  I know people in Hollywood.
[03:37:53.078 --> 03:38:02.728]  I knew when we were going to make Loose Change Final Cut with Charlie Sheen that Mark Cuban was going to put it out in theaters nationwide and he got threats.
[03:38:02.728 --> 03:38:09.154]  And then other people's families, a general, who is the brother of a producer's wife,
[03:38:09.980 --> 03:38:14.883]  Called up and said, your kids can get killed doing this, you better not do it, okay?
[03:38:14.883 --> 03:38:29.273]  Now, I was asked, shut up about that, until it was in the news that the White House had the Securities and Exchange Commission call up Mark Cuban, and they also sent an email, and said, we're gonna destroy you for this, so he dropped out of it.
[03:38:29.273 --> 03:38:35.638]  They still indicted him, and then it came out he was indicted for no reason, so the court case just got beaten two months ago.
[03:38:36.485 --> 03:38:38.746]  This is now admitted.
[03:38:38.746 --> 03:38:45.409]  And so when the New York Times comes out and writes about it, they're just threatening everyone.
[03:38:45.409 --> 03:38:46.129]  But I agree with you.
[03:38:46.129 --> 03:38:47.149]  A lot of it isn't control.
[03:38:47.149 --> 03:38:48.370]  Go ahead.
[03:38:48.370 --> 03:38:50.951]  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't necessarily trying to get off on that tangent.
[03:38:50.951 --> 03:38:59.855]  I was just making the point that it is so already ingrained in our culture and in our conscience that those are the types of things we want to see.
[03:38:59.855 --> 03:39:01.995]  Those are the types of things that people just write about.
[03:39:03.743 --> 03:39:06.124]  We're, you know, for whatever reason drawn to those things.
[03:39:06.124 --> 03:39:15.847]  It's not that they're necessarily accurate or true, but I think we were fascinated with the end times and some of these technologies.
[03:39:15.847 --> 03:39:17.027]  And our own destruction.
[03:39:17.027 --> 03:39:18.988]  Exactly, for whatever reason.
[03:39:18.988 --> 03:39:25.350]  Okay, I want to go to phone calls and a few other items, but will you guys bring me that Eve YouTube clip in?
[03:39:25.350 --> 03:39:26.290]  I printed this up.
[03:39:27.870 --> 03:39:31.596]  I linked from a YouTube ad to this, but then YouTube itself has the video.
[03:39:31.596 --> 03:39:34.080]  It's called the Butterfly Effect.
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:34.561]  Thank you, Jaren.
[03:39:36.508 --> 03:39:42.411]  And when you click through to the Eve site, it says, your life will now matter.
[03:39:42.411 --> 03:39:43.792]  You're going to be important.
[03:39:43.792 --> 03:39:44.993]  This is where you fight.
[03:39:44.993 --> 03:39:46.994]  This is where you're a man.
[03:39:46.994 --> 03:39:48.595]  300,000 people.
[03:39:48.595 --> 03:39:59.841]  And so you have people paying in the real world with these simulation games, $50,000 for a Ferrari in the game to buy it from somebody, because there's only so many Ferraris in the imaginary world.
[03:39:59.841 --> 03:40:03.523]  And they're actually getting real dates in the real world out of this.
[03:40:03.523 --> 03:40:05.784]  They're training you to be inserted into the matrix.
[03:40:06.124 --> 03:40:16.172]  What people don't realize is that by playing these games, you are projecting some type of desire to be needed or have that value.
[03:40:16.172 --> 03:40:18.734]  There's a real fight in the real world.
[03:40:18.734 --> 03:40:19.975]  You're needed right now.
[03:40:19.975 --> 03:40:21.636]  This is the real world.
[03:40:21.636 --> 03:40:24.838]  You have worth now in the real world.
[03:40:24.838 --> 03:40:25.919]  You don't have to play a game.
[03:40:28.181 --> 03:40:50.013]  Listen, the social engineers, I read documents from universities in the 60s, in fact in the extras of Endgame, Endgame 1.5, it's for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, Dr. Michael Kaufman, the PhD, reads documents from universities saying, we're going to have complex computer games, we're going to have drugs, we're going to have like a Soma drug, Prozac, it will be sports, we're going to build stadiums everywhere.
[03:40:50.013 --> 03:40:52.355]  And of course that was written about in 1900 as well by H.G.
[03:40:52.355 --> 03:40:55.416]  Wells, but you're absolutely right, they know
[03:40:56.537 --> 03:41:00.198]  They don't want you out really involved in the real world interfacing.
[03:41:00.198 --> 03:41:03.279]  They want you fully being wire-headed into this.
[03:41:03.279 --> 03:41:04.120]  Cyberpunks!
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:15.163]  They want you on the couch, they want you staring at a glassy box, you know, getting the 40 megahertz frequency pumped in your head so that you just are droned out and you're sitting there doing nothing.
[03:41:15.163 --> 03:41:19.145]  It's admitted that Americans 30 years ago had a higher wavelength.
[03:41:19.145 --> 03:41:22.466]  The average American is in a dreamlike daydream state.
[03:41:23.146 --> 03:41:24.127]  They're zombies, man.
[03:41:24.127 --> 03:41:30.095]  That's why you can't talk to them and they've had psychological compulsions.
[03:41:31.505 --> 03:41:32.666]  Psychological suggestions.
[03:41:32.666 --> 03:41:38.248]  This is admitted and planted that when they hear us talk about the New World Order or global government getting involved, they giggle and get a glassy.
[03:41:38.248 --> 03:41:39.728]  That's their pre-programmed.
[03:41:39.728 --> 03:41:45.111]  These films that we've created here, this is... They go into the Matrix and deprogram.
[03:41:45.111 --> 03:41:45.971]  They're red pills.
[03:41:45.971 --> 03:41:47.092]  It's shock therapy.
[03:41:47.092 --> 03:41:48.572]  It's like, boom, here it is.
[03:41:48.572 --> 03:41:57.936]  And that's what your films did to me, Alex, is it put me up against the wall and made me... You were a risk management guy for a big company, making a lot of money, and you got deprogrammed, didn't you, Franchi?
[03:41:57.936 --> 03:41:58.897]  Yes, I did.
[03:41:58.897 --> 03:41:59.537]  Now look at you.
[03:42:00.734 --> 03:42:02.695]  You've done well, my apprentice.
[03:42:02.695 --> 03:42:04.356]  Thank you.
[03:42:04.356 --> 03:42:05.197]  Thank you, Lord Jones.
[03:42:05.197 --> 03:42:09.419]  We're going to actually have a Lord on soon here on the show.
[03:42:09.419 --> 03:42:10.800]  All right.
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:11.981]  Here's Eve, folks.
[03:42:11.981 --> 03:42:22.207]  Now, here it talks about how you have value, how you change things, how you have power by one decision you make in the video game, by blasting a pirate ship, a pirate spaceship.
[03:42:22.907 --> 03:42:26.149]  But when you read the game, it's like your life is not going to have value.
[03:42:26.149 --> 03:42:28.550]  And so I started looking at other simulation games.
[03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:29.871]  It's all the same.
[03:42:29.871 --> 03:42:44.579]  And you have millions of people, in some cases, with World of Warcraft and all this, and all these Marine Corps games, which the Pentagon admits they're funding to then program you, where they admitted that the simulators in the games are exactly the same as real Predator drones.
[03:42:44.579 --> 03:42:46.440]  So now you're blowing up real people on the ground.
[03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:57.588]  I've played games where I'm controlling a part of an elite military squadron and there's people playing connected on the internet in their own homes.
[03:42:58.683 --> 03:43:00.043]  And they're all running around this virtual world.
[03:43:00.043 --> 03:43:01.084]  No, no, that's the game.
[03:43:01.084 --> 03:43:02.704]  World of Warcraft has three, four million.
[03:43:02.704 --> 03:43:03.824]  There's all these other games.
[03:43:03.824 --> 03:43:05.845]  Call of Duty or one of those games.
[03:43:05.845 --> 03:43:08.646]  Where you torture people and kill them now and kill civilians.
[03:43:08.646 --> 03:43:11.246]  And again, it dehumanizes all these simulated murders.
[03:43:11.246 --> 03:43:15.528]  That's why folks 50 years ago got scared if they saw a simulated murder on TV.
[03:43:15.528 --> 03:43:22.169]  Now they don't care if humans are dying, but if they see a dog die simulated, people freak out because the dog still has value.
[03:43:22.169 --> 03:43:24.090]  Humans have been dehumanized.
[03:43:24.090 --> 03:43:26.531]  Here is the game trying to suck your soul.
[03:43:26.531 --> 03:43:27.031]  The game is Eve.
[03:43:28.291 --> 03:43:29.952]  Here's the game trying to suck your soul.
[03:43:29.952 --> 03:43:33.274]  There's all these men who have addictions, don't even have time with their wife or kids.
[03:43:33.274 --> 03:43:36.936]  They quit their jobs to play these games because this is where they have value.
[03:43:36.936 --> 03:43:39.738]  This is where they're a starship commander!
[03:43:39.738 --> 03:43:46.562]  Instead of in the real world with world government poisoning your water supply, you're in the middle of a real operation.
[03:43:46.562 --> 03:43:48.003]  We're fighting for our lives.
[03:43:48.003 --> 03:43:50.504]  People are being killed and set up over this.
[03:43:50.504 --> 03:43:52.346]  And, oh no, I don't want to be in the real world.
[03:43:52.346 --> 03:43:56.528]  I want to fly around in my little fake spaceship or as a big giant goblin.
[03:43:56.528 --> 03:43:57.449]  World of Warcraft!
[03:43:58.550 --> 03:44:00.091]  You know, I mean, it's total crap.
[03:44:00.091 --> 03:44:00.591]  Here it is.
[03:44:00.591 --> 03:44:03.773]  T for violence.
[03:44:03.773 --> 03:44:08.535]  Crank it up.
[03:44:08.535 --> 03:44:14.678]  In chaos theory, there's a concept known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
[03:44:14.678 --> 03:44:17.620]  Most people call it the butterfly effect.
[03:44:17.620 --> 03:44:22.702]  In Eve, we call it the sandbox.
[03:44:22.702 --> 03:44:25.143]  Let's say this is you.
[03:44:25.143 --> 03:44:27.925]  One lone wolf flying a starship in the far reaches of space.
[03:44:29.406 --> 03:44:33.469]  And in your travels, you encounter this.
[03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:37.172]  A defenseless mining barge under attack by pirates.
[03:44:37.172 --> 03:44:40.154]  You have a split second to make a choice.
[03:44:40.154 --> 03:44:43.536]  Without your help, the miner doesn't stand a chance.
[03:44:43.536 --> 03:44:46.779]  You decide to be the hero and succeed in driving the raiders away.
[03:44:53.106 --> 03:45:00.048]  The victim is thankful, and in the conversation that follows, a friendly gang that was on its way to help finally arrives.
[03:45:00.048 --> 03:45:03.930]  Grateful for your assistance, they invite you to fly with them.
[03:45:03.930 --> 03:45:22.516]  As it turns out, that gang was on its way to regroup with more patrols, who are all members of the same corporation, which happens to be part of an alliance of corporations, that is currently at war with another alliance, whose patrols have just spotted the one you're flying with, right now.
[03:45:27.287 --> 03:45:30.528]  Your decision to help that miner led to this moment.
[03:45:30.528 --> 03:45:33.169]  An epic battle between thousands of players.
[03:45:33.169 --> 03:45:39.452]  And the chance to share that experience with new friends that you might have for the rest of your life.
[03:45:39.452 --> 03:45:43.053]  Hundreds of thousands of people could hear about this battle.
[03:45:43.053 --> 03:45:44.473]  Why so many?
[03:45:44.473 --> 03:45:46.954]  Because it all happened in one universe.
[03:45:46.954 --> 03:45:48.615]  Not in separate realms.
[03:45:48.615 --> 03:45:50.876]  Just one big sandbox.
[03:45:50.876 --> 03:45:54.157]  Where the actions of one person can resonate throughout the entire game world.
[03:45:57.324 --> 03:46:00.645]  In EVE, the choices you make shape the outcome of events.
[03:46:00.645 --> 03:46:04.246]  You could have helped those pirates, or just flown on by.
[03:46:04.246 --> 03:46:08.287]  What matters most is that the experience was emergent, unscripted.
[03:46:08.287 --> 03:46:15.709]  Because in the sandbox, all player actions, no matter how subtle or bold, always have an impact.
[03:46:15.709 --> 03:46:17.749]  Imagine what you could become a part of.
[03:46:17.749 --> 03:46:22.150]  Being in the right place, at the right time, could touch the lives of more than 300,000 people in 230 countries around the world.
[03:46:26.917 --> 03:46:29.507]  Welcome to EVE Online.
[03:46:29.507 --> 03:46:31.233]  The universe is yours.
[03:46:33.852 --> 03:47:01.601]  So this puts you into a false virtual reality where anybody who wants to be involved, anybody that wants to help, you're not in the real world as Gore's dual role in Spotlight, goad for cause and investor, how he's making all the money off enslaving you and your family, they're poisoning your water supply to brain damage you, it's admitted, but you don't care about fighting someone poisoning you, you want to go play starship commander when the elite actually plan to block off new technological development, freeze us here,
[03:47:02.681 --> 03:47:10.487]  One child policy exterminate most of us and then the elite they go to the real stars while we all sit are getting euthanized playing games going
[03:47:11.544 --> 03:47:13.005]  Hooked into a matrix.
[03:47:13.005 --> 03:47:15.847]  This is how we're being inserted into the matrix.
[03:47:15.847 --> 03:47:18.390]  And that's what the matrix is, is predictive programming.
[03:47:18.390 --> 03:47:20.731]  How were the people inserted into the matrix?
[03:47:20.731 --> 03:47:24.775]  They were offered a false reality when the guy says, I don't want to remember nothing.
[03:47:24.775 --> 03:47:25.395]  Pay me off.
[03:47:25.395 --> 03:47:28.258]  I want to be a movie star in the false reality.
[03:47:28.258 --> 03:47:30.700]  Well, in these false realities, you are a movie star.
[03:47:30.700 --> 03:47:34.643]  They have games where you're a movie star with hundreds of thousands of other jackasses.
[03:47:37.506 --> 03:47:48.673]  You know, I don't play those games, but I can understand the appeal that people have because... Yeah, you're not supposed to go out and talk to your neighbors, but you can go out and talk to your neighbors and fight the Goblin Fleet.
[03:47:48.673 --> 03:47:49.553]  Online.
[03:47:49.553 --> 03:47:49.914]  Online.
[03:47:49.914 --> 03:47:51.174]  Just don't go outside your house.
[03:47:51.174 --> 03:47:51.535]  That's right.
[03:47:51.535 --> 03:47:59.079]  Because, you know, if you go outside your house and talk to them, then you're perhaps going to transmit a little bit of truth from one to the other.
[03:47:59.079 --> 03:47:59.740]  Ooh, that's bad.
[03:47:59.740 --> 03:48:01.421]  You don't do that, but you can be a space commander.
[03:48:02.462 --> 03:48:04.784]  You can leak secrets to be a 25-foot goblin.
[03:48:04.784 --> 03:48:09.346]  You can leak secrets to be a spy for some online game.
[03:48:09.346 --> 03:48:15.790]  But don't, whatever you do, don't burn a copy of this DVD and don't pass it off to your friends.
[03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:17.892]  Because that would be real.
[03:48:17.892 --> 03:48:18.992]  And we can't have that.
[03:48:18.992 --> 03:48:21.434]  You might actually affect something in the real world.
[03:48:21.434 --> 03:48:23.435]  You might actually have worth, value.
[03:48:23.435 --> 03:48:24.636]  You might actually have a soul.
[03:48:24.636 --> 03:48:26.197]  Let's talk to somebody who disagrees.
[03:48:26.197 --> 03:48:27.097]  Rick in the Bahamas.
[03:48:27.097 --> 03:48:27.658]  Go ahead, Rick.
[03:48:31.345 --> 03:48:33.127]  Yeah, no I don't hear you.
[03:48:33.127 --> 03:48:34.268]  It's very strange.
[03:48:34.268 --> 03:48:35.550]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:37.552]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:48:37.552 --> 03:48:41.016]  Yeah, I just wanted to, well thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:41.016 --> 03:48:46.923]  I want to tell you that, you know, I respect the show and I think it's great.
[03:48:46.923 --> 03:48:48.004]  Okay, what do you disagree with?
[03:48:48.004 --> 03:48:48.465]  That's fine.
[03:48:48.465 --> 03:48:49.566]  You don't have to say you respect it.
[03:48:49.566 --> 03:48:49.927]  Go ahead.
[03:48:51.152 --> 03:49:06.545]  Okay, it's, uh, the gold prices that Ted has on Franks and Sovereigns are always more expensive than you can get from a, I won't say their name, but a very well-known, reputable online broker.
[03:49:06.545 --> 03:49:09.728]  Okay, listen, sir, I appreciate your call, and you sell for them in the Bahamas.
[03:49:10.308 --> 03:49:12.469]  I bought gold and silver from Ted every time.
[03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:15.011]  That's a great deal that he has.
[03:49:15.011 --> 03:49:16.472]  I've seen the sheets that Ted has.
[03:49:16.472 --> 03:49:23.075]  4%, not even 4%, it'll be like $230 coin, $4, $5.
[03:49:23.075 --> 03:49:24.796]  And Ted supports this network.
[03:49:24.796 --> 03:49:27.378]  That's why you should buy your gold from Ted Anderson.
[03:49:27.378 --> 03:49:28.678]  He's got a great deal.
[03:49:28.678 --> 03:49:29.119]  Okay?
[03:49:29.119 --> 03:49:30.179]  Don't buy it from us.
[03:49:30.179 --> 03:49:30.620]  Fine.
[03:49:30.620 --> 03:49:31.160]  Great.
[03:49:31.160 --> 03:49:32.441]  It's not a good deal.
[03:49:32.441 --> 03:49:33.861]  My films aren't good.
[03:49:33.861 --> 03:49:35.362]  People complain that I give them out for free.
[03:49:35.362 --> 03:49:36.143]  They say that's not enough.
[03:49:36.923 --> 03:49:41.225]  And I say, here's my film, get it for free, YouTube, Google, right now, get it out to everybody.
[03:49:41.225 --> 03:49:42.366]  That's not enough!
[03:49:42.366 --> 03:49:45.788]  You shouldn't even sell one to make money!
[03:49:45.788 --> 03:49:52.491]  I mean, you know, you shouldn't even have money, you guys shouldn't have money to fly here, to fly here to interview me.
[03:49:52.491 --> 03:50:05.799]  It's okay for the government with taxes to take our money and use it against us, but if we as entrepreneurs and as free market people go out and say, I've made a DVD, you can buy it if you want to, or you can watch it for free online, but please get this out to people.
[03:50:06.659 --> 03:50:10.021]  And I happen to know those are great deals on what Ted's selling.
[03:50:10.021 --> 03:50:17.646]  Now, there may be somebody out there that I don't know about who can buy it, who bought a bunch when it was $900 an ounce and can sell it for less now, but I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[03:50:17.646 --> 03:50:18.727]  Here's Ted Anderson's number.
[03:50:18.727 --> 03:50:32.336]  You should buy it from him because he supports this network and because he's put radio ads on national radio promoting the Obama deception, and he's gonna do it for this, and he gave over $300,000 to Ron Paul for the Ron Paul Air Force, and I don't want to hear, oh, Ron Paul lost.
[03:50:32.336 --> 03:50:35.979]  No, he created a nationwide movement, and people know the fellow deserves the enemy now.
[03:50:37.059 --> 03:50:43.163]  You can call and disagree about something I cover here, but just attacking us and our sponsors is a load of crap.
[03:50:43.163 --> 03:50:44.464]  I believe in all my sponsors.
[03:50:44.464 --> 03:50:45.685]  Call Ted Anderson.
[03:50:45.685 --> 03:50:46.305]  Buy silver.
[03:50:46.305 --> 03:50:46.866]  Buy gold.
[03:50:46.866 --> 03:50:49.447]  Even if it wasn't a good deal, it's a great place to buy it.
[03:50:49.447 --> 03:50:50.748]  And it is a great deal.
[03:50:50.748 --> 03:50:53.990]  And I've been telling you to buy gold since it was $300 an ounce.
[03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:55.351]  Unbelievable.
[03:50:55.351 --> 03:50:58.693]  We got all this stuff coming down on us, and we got a bitch about Ted.
[03:50:58.693 --> 03:50:59.194]  That's great.
[03:51:03.368 --> 03:51:05.370]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:05.370 --> 03:51:11.155]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:11.155 --> 03:51:12.517]  Will they do it?
[03:51:12.517 --> 03:51:15.119]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.119 --> 03:51:21.065]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.585 --> 03:51:23.767]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:23.767 --> 03:51:28.051]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.051 --> 03:51:32.936]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:32.936 --> 03:51:37.860]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:37.860 --> 03:51:42.684]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.585 --> 03:51:52.015]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:52.015 --> 03:51:54.518]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:54.518 --> 03:51:57.581]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:51:57.581 --> 03:52:00.485]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:52:02.927 --> 03:52:06.590]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:10.193]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.193 --> 03:52:15.358]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:52:15.358 --> 03:52:21.403]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.403 --> 03:52:23.625]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:52:24.145 --> 03:52:25.486]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:25.486 --> 03:52:27.006]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[03:52:47.436 --> 03:52:50.341]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.341 --> 03:52:59.477]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:53:01.716 --> 03:53:03.478]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:53:03.478 --> 03:53:04.999]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:53:04.999 --> 03:53:06.320]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:53:06.320 --> 03:53:08.262]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:53:08.262 --> 03:53:17.070]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:53:17.070 --> 03:53:22.335]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:53:22.475 --> 03:53:24.277]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:53:24.277 --> 03:53:31.765]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:53:31.765 --> 03:53:35.949]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:53:35.949 --> 03:53:38.472]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[03:53:38.672 --> 03:53:43.657]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[03:54:10.854 --> 03:54:13.676]  I want to say something here right at the end of the show.
[03:54:13.676 --> 03:54:22.762]  We as patriots need to get over the fact that the media tells us you're not allowed to make films, you're not allowed to write and sell books.
[03:54:22.762 --> 03:54:27.566]  I've been on so many national shows and TV and they go, Mr. Jones, you do sell your movies, don't you?
[03:54:28.246 --> 03:54:33.149]  And I go, yeah, you little bastards, you're all financed by the big banks here on this TV or radio show.
[03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:35.190]  Of course I'm here making money.
[03:54:35.190 --> 03:54:39.672]  But that doesn't take away from my moral stand and that I promote what I believe.
[03:54:39.672 --> 03:54:44.375]  I mean, I have a right to say I'm against world government and global carbon taxes.
[03:54:44.375 --> 03:54:48.077]  I have a right to say I'm against banks raping us.
[03:54:48.077 --> 03:54:49.918]  But see, it's a little, it's a mind game.
[03:54:49.918 --> 03:54:52.359]  We're supposed to, oh, I'm sorry, I had a sponsor.
[03:54:52.359 --> 03:54:54.040]  I'm sorry, I sold a video.
[03:54:54.040 --> 03:54:54.580]  I'm sorry.
[03:54:56.241 --> 03:55:01.546]  And I see these lies online going, Alex Jones sells his videos for $50 a piece.
[03:55:01.546 --> 03:55:05.149]  You can buy almost all my films for $5.95 when you get them in bulk.
[03:55:05.149 --> 03:55:06.671]  You can get them for $9.95.
[03:55:06.671 --> 03:55:09.233]  You can get them for $19.95.
[03:55:09.233 --> 03:55:10.854]  Maybe I should sell them for more.
[03:55:10.854 --> 03:55:11.775]  It's not bad.
[03:55:11.775 --> 03:55:13.156]  It's a free market.
[03:55:13.156 --> 03:55:17.400]  It's free association for me to make films.
[03:55:17.400 --> 03:55:18.421]  I mean, this sucker cost me $200,000.
[03:55:18.421 --> 03:55:18.942]  $200,000 to make this.
[03:55:23.055 --> 03:55:23.396]  $200,000.
[03:55:23.396 --> 03:55:31.540]  I need to make my money back and I still let people bootleg them everywhere because I want it out there.
[03:55:31.540 --> 03:55:33.241]  I want the thing.
[03:55:33.241 --> 03:55:39.305]  I post on my site where you can get it for free, which nobody else does, and then people try to take my films away from me.
[03:55:39.305 --> 03:55:44.328]  There are people selling it on Amazon who tell Amazon it's theirs and I can't even sell my own stuff there.
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:46.021]  And I'm
[03:56:00.640 --> 03:56:01.561]  Send the number to Ted Anderson.
[03:56:01.561 --> 03:56:02.681]  You call folks.
[03:56:02.681 --> 03:56:04.443]  It's above $1,090.
[03:56:04.443 --> 03:56:04.803]  Right up.
[03:56:04.803 --> 03:56:06.284]  It was $189 today.
[03:56:06.284 --> 03:56:06.884]  Call.
[03:56:06.884 --> 03:56:07.785]  Buy the gold.
[03:56:07.785 --> 03:56:08.485]  Buy the silver.
[03:56:08.485 --> 03:56:09.546]  It's a great deal.
[03:56:09.546 --> 03:56:11.207]  Plus your support in this radio show.
[03:56:11.207 --> 03:56:11.627]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:11.627 --> 03:56:15.130]  And you know what?
[03:56:15.130 --> 03:56:17.291]  If you want to just flat out donate to me.
[03:56:17.291 --> 03:56:18.172]  Send us the check.
[03:56:18.172 --> 03:56:19.253]  Send us the money.
[03:56:19.253 --> 03:56:21.554]  We will put it towards the fight against the New World Order.
[03:56:21.554 --> 03:56:26.958]  We will put it towards bigger offices, more equipment, more employees, more people fighting the New World Order.
[03:56:29.130 --> 03:56:36.858]  Well, the fact is, you know, we made this film Camp FEMA, and now we've got other projects in the works because of the success of that movie.
[03:56:36.858 --> 03:56:38.059]  It's a mind game!
[03:56:38.059 --> 03:56:38.759]  Good!
[03:56:38.759 --> 03:56:42.783]  Everybody buy Camp FEMA right now at InfoWars.com!
[03:56:42.783 --> 03:56:45.546]  We're not funded by David Rockefeller!
[03:56:45.546 --> 03:56:46.807]  We're funded by you!
[03:56:48.701 --> 03:56:50.964]  We've got a new film coming out.
[03:56:50.964 --> 03:56:52.726]  It's called Don't Tread on Me.
[03:56:52.726 --> 03:56:55.729]  We're taking a look at the state's sovereignty movement.
[03:56:55.729 --> 03:56:57.632]  No, you're not allowed to make a film!
[03:56:57.632 --> 03:57:00.815]  Ron Paul's not allowed to sell a book!
[03:57:00.815 --> 03:57:02.497]  He's supposed to give it out for free!
[03:57:03.237 --> 03:57:06.079]  Well, if you want to watch Camp FEMA for free, you can.
[03:57:06.079 --> 03:57:12.702]  Tomorrow night, Wednesday, November the 4th, 8 o'clock at Brave New Books, 1904 Guadalupe Street in Austin.
[03:57:12.702 --> 03:57:16.265]  And Gary and I are both going to be there answering questions afterwards.
[03:57:16.265 --> 03:57:17.725]  I hope you introduce yourselves.
[03:57:17.725 --> 03:57:21.447]  I'll send everybody over there.
[03:57:21.447 --> 03:57:24.549]  It's hilarious, but seriously, Brave New Books are great guys that work there.
[03:57:24.549 --> 03:57:26.350]  It's down at the end of Guadalupe, nice place.
[03:57:26.350 --> 03:57:29.052]  Get there early, that only holds about 120 and it fills up fast.
[03:57:29.434 --> 03:57:30.995]  Yeah, we were surprised last time.
[03:57:30.995 --> 03:57:32.215]  And how dare them?
[03:57:32.215 --> 03:57:39.059]  They should have that prime real estate bookstore to wake up the kids on campus underneath the Chase Bank building.
[03:57:39.059 --> 03:57:40.480]  It should be free.
[03:57:40.480 --> 03:57:44.402]  They should go get that space and just give everything out for free.
[03:57:44.402 --> 03:57:47.903]  Of course, they could do what Al Gore does, steal your money and pay it to himself.
[03:57:47.903 --> 03:57:49.424]  But that's okay.
[03:57:49.424 --> 03:57:50.565]  That's all right.
[03:57:50.565 --> 03:57:52.646]  Taking tax money for Al Gore.
[03:57:52.646 --> 03:57:53.486]  That's all right.
[03:57:53.486 --> 03:57:57.108]  Stealing people's money at gunpoint with the police, that's good.
[03:57:57.108 --> 03:57:58.349]  You are bad!
[03:58:01.232 --> 03:58:02.753]  I have no response to that.
[03:58:02.753 --> 03:58:04.074]  I just disagree with it.
[03:58:04.074 --> 03:58:08.898]  Well, anybody else who disagrees needs to buy Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:08.898 --> 03:58:10.680]  Hintfema at Infowars.com.
[03:58:10.680 --> 03:58:13.922]  And I'm honored to be in both your new films you're making.
[03:58:13.922 --> 03:58:18.266]  And I'm honored to be interviewed by you for an hour and a half after this transmission ends.
[03:58:18.266 --> 03:58:19.527]  And you men have done a great job.
[03:58:19.527 --> 03:58:22.990]  I'm sorry to get to the other callers, but I went into rant mode, which I'm legendary for.
[03:58:24.235 --> 03:58:27.378]  And again, show the globalists you're not going to be intimidated.
[03:58:27.378 --> 03:58:33.123]  Spread the word about this radio show, the free podcast that cost me about $6,000 a month to stream out.
[03:58:33.123 --> 03:58:35.344]  How dare I build this operation?
[03:58:35.344 --> 03:58:38.227]  How dare I have sponsors to pay for the free bandwidth?
[03:58:38.227 --> 03:58:39.028]  It's bad!
[03:58:39.028 --> 03:58:39.728]  I'm bad!
[03:58:39.728 --> 03:58:42.971]  I'm bad!
[03:58:42.971 --> 03:58:46.374]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.374 --> 03:58:48.456]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.072 --> 03:58:54.455]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.455 --> 03:58:58.079]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.079 --> 03:59:02.643]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.643 --> 03:59:07.207]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:59:07.207 --> 03:59:10.070]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly.
[03:59:10.350 --> 03:59:13.291]  It emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.291 --> 03:59:16.912]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:16.912 --> 03:59:21.734]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.734 --> 03:59:28.296]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.296 --> 03:59:30.257]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.797 --> 03:59:32.939]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[03:59:32.939 --> 03:59:36.381]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
