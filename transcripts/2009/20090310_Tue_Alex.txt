[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.836]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:08.517]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.972]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the next hour and 52 minutes.
[00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:46.754]  It's left in the show today, simulcasting the radio show.
[00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:54.218]  We have Webster Tarpley joining us about 50 minutes from now to give us the latest on Obama's criminal activities.
[00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.601]  Then we're going to have Keith Bryan on from Ireland.
[00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:01.903]  Mainstream news is reporting that they were doing drills
[00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:10.910]  When the military men in Northern Ireland got shot, the British troops, as we predicted they would, and it's coming out, that the guards stood down and didn't shoot at the people that were shooting.
[00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:23.021]  So, and with over 75% of the past attacks in Northern Ireland and Ireland and in England being connected and carried out by British Special Forces, SAS, as has been covered by mainstream British news,
[00:01:24.162 --> 00:01:28.346]  We are, and that's why they had to stop a lot of it four or five years ago, because it did become public.
[00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:30.347]  It looks like they're back to their old tricks.
[00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:34.030]  It's almost completely confirmed, the classic MO on that front.
[00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.454]  For the next 20 minutes, we are joined by Terry Bresci.
[00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:40.716]  And Terry Bresci,
[00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:59.086]  is an individual who lives somewhere near the border and they've now moved border checkpoints in some cases a hundred miles away from the border they call them constitution free zones and they're harassing citizens and i would add here that we support the border patrol their constitutional duty it's one of the few things the feds do that's constitutional and we support it
[00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:00.167]  I don't know.
[00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:28.529]  Illegal aliens are allowed to get the stimulus money, and they don't have to show that they're American citizens like citizens do.
[00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.752]  It's literally just a double standard.
[00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:34.173]  So, Terry Bresci, I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:36.055]  Thank you for having me.
[00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:36.595]  Good to be here.
[00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:43.380]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're located, and some of the plethora of YouTube videos that you've got.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.326]  We're going to put a few of them up on screen without the audio, you know, showing what you go through and what happens at these checkpoints inside the United States.
[00:02:52.754 --> 00:02:53.074]  Sure.
[00:02:54.114 --> 00:03:07.018]  I live in Tucson, Arizona, which is about 40 miles north of the international border with Mexico, and I frequent State Route 86, which is an east-west highway that takes me out to one of my remote work sites.
[00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:18.842]  I work up at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, and we have a couple telescopes up there that I keep running and I observe on to look for asteroids and comets in the solar system.
[00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:28.441]  So my work takes me along remote sections of the desert on a fairly regular basis, and this is where I've encountered quite a few checkpoints over the years.
[00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:33.087]  Break down what you're dealing with and the type of things you go through.
[00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:43.919]  Well, you know, what first got me interested, or first got me involved with this issue of checkpoints, was an incident from 2002.
[00:03:44.399 --> 00:04:01.486]  I was traveling back to Tucson after working the day on a mountain, and I was stopped at a checkpoint that was being operated primarily by the tribal police, but there was also present the Department of Homeland Security in the form of U.S.
[00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:06.088]  Customs agents and Border Patrol agents who were working the front line with the tribal police.
[00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:13.152]  And when I pulled up to the checkpoint and was stopped, I asked the stopping officer what was the purpose of the checkpoint.
[00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:15.413]  And he told me that it was a sobriety checkpoint.
[00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:25.978]  And I'm thinking to myself, well, if it's a sobriety checkpoint, then you don't need federal agents working on the front line with local law enforcement officers to check sobriety.
[00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:27.619]  Because sobriety is a local issue.
[00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:28.699]  It's a state issue.
[00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.040]  It's not a federal issue.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.983]  Just like they're now using Marines in California at DWI checkpoints to condition the public.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.001]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:49.966]  What I found is a lot of times local jurisdictions and the federal government, they use checkpoints that have been allowed by the courts under very limited scope.
[00:04:50.707 --> 00:05:00.652]  They use those as a pretext to do far more expensive operations than they would be allowed to otherwise by claiming that it's only a sobriety checkpoint or it's an immigration checkpoint.
[00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:05.654]  But in reality, they're doing these dragnet type of operations where they're looking for everything from felons
[00:05:06.144 --> 00:05:12.307]  to weapons, terrorists, narcotics, and other things.
[00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:29.854]  So it's really problematic in the way that law enforcement agencies have taken the inch that was given to them by the various courts and the American people in many regards, and they've turned it into a 100-mile Constitution-free zone, if you will.
[00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.423]  Amazing, and we're putting some of those videos on screen.
[00:05:34.443 --> 00:05:39.630]  I mean, you explained to the Border Patrol, look, this isn't a federal function, a sobriety checkpoint.
[00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:45.898]  We see the mainstream reports how they're targeting citizens, how illegal aliens just drive right through, but they target
[00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.879]  I don't
[00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.618]  You know, it's happening all over Seattle now.
[00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:08.898]  They're doing it to people in Seattle and surrounding counties.
[00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:13.619]  They're doing it deep into other states, Wyoming and Utah and other places.
[00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.321]  I mean, clearly, this is the federal police force expanding, and you explain this to them in the videos, don't you?
[00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:21.982]  I certainly do.
[00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:24.482]  Well, actually, I take that back.
[00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:34.225]  Going back to my 2002 incident, like I said, it was a dragnet operation that was being primarily conducted by the tribal police.
[00:06:35.055 --> 00:06:40.479]  Um, and so it was, that operation was slightly different from what I've been experiencing over the past year.
[00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:48.624]  And that particular operation, when I challenged the scope of what they were doing, I was dragged out of my vehicle, uh, arrested and dragged off the side of the road.
[00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:50.345]  I fought the chargers in court.
[00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:53.247]  I beat the charges and had them dismissed with prejudice.
[00:06:53.307 --> 00:06:55.008]  And then I turned around and I filed a lawsuit.
[00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:59.331]  That lawsuit has been in, uh, ongoing for the past five years.
[00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:05.263]  And it's currently in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals where we're challenging the legitimacy of the checkpoint itself.
[00:07:05.984 --> 00:07:09.750]  The newer checkpoints that I've come across since January of 2008
[00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:19.458]  ...have been conducted solely by the Department of Homeland Security via Customs and Border Protection agents with the United States Border Patrol.
[00:07:20.078 --> 00:07:29.163]  But the problem that we see here is, once again, it's very similar and you can see it in articles where spokespersons for the U.S.
[00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:37.428]  Border Patrol have stated that they're using these immigration checkpoints to look for felons, weapons, and I'm talking about guns,
[00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:42.206]  Uh, here, um, narcotics, uh, terrorists and aliens.
[00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:43.447]  Even though the U.S.
[00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:54.979]  Supreme Court, uh, back in 1976, they allowed immigration checkpoints inside the country, but only for permanent checkpoint installations and only near nexus points for border traffic.
[00:07:54.999 --> 00:08:00.705]  And what that means is where the primary traffic going to the checkpoint originated from the border.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:13.983]  What they're doing now is, instead of conducting these checkpoints at permanent installations near nexus points, they're conducting them all over the place, along secondary roads, along roads that have no direct nexus to the border.
[00:08:14.664 --> 00:08:16.944]  And they're far exceeding the scope that the U.S.
[00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:18.025]  Supreme Court said.
[00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:26.567]  And what they stated was that very brief stops were allowed at these internal immigration checkpoints for the sole purpose of making immigration queries.
[00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:37.356]  And that any further detention or any further or any searching of the vehicle had to be premised upon probable cause or consent by the driver.
[00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:43.938]  But what the Border Patrol is actually doing is they're conducting temporary or tactical checkpoints all over the place.
[00:08:44.678 --> 00:08:53.381]  And they're admitting that they're looking for a whole host of other subjects besides just illegal aliens.
[00:08:54.205 --> 00:09:01.607]  And they are detaining individuals for long periods of time and searching vehicles absent consent or absent probable cause.
[00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:05.909]  And also, they don't like being photographed by you, but they're there photographing, videotaping you.
[00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:07.369]  Right, right.
[00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:08.210]  Exactly.
[00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.771]  So, from my first experience in 2002, I learned a lot.
[00:09:12.611 --> 00:09:17.753]  I learned that law enforcement agents will lie when you bring them into court.
[00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:21.654]  That they will destroy documentation and evidence.
[00:09:22.442 --> 00:09:25.144]  And that they will misrepresent the nature of what they're doing.
[00:09:25.684 --> 00:09:51.842]  So in order to protect myself from future actions after 2002, I started carrying video cameras with me, recording devices, cell phones, so that I could, A, contact other people when I know that I was going to enter a checkpoint, so that other people know where I was and what to expect, and B, so that I could make a record of what actually happened, so that there would be no doubt in a court of law as to what actually happened.
[00:09:52.692 --> 00:10:07.499]  And so, since 2008, when the Border Patrol set up this particular checkpoint along SR 86, that's been there 24-7 for the last year, I've documented over 70 checkpoint stops going through that particular checkpoint.
[00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:13.702]  And as you indicated, I have about 14 or 15 of those video encounters online.
[00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:27.336]  Well, you're doing a great job, and there's video after video posted on your website, you have them up on YouTube, it's checkpointusa.com, and I mean, they get very, very belligerent when you say, look, I'm a U.S.
[00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:32.599]  citizen, leave me alone, you know, why are you out here doing a DWI or a weapons check or a drug checkpoint?
[00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:38.682]  You're supposed to be checking for illegal aliens, and then in every case we find out they're not going after the illegal aliens, they're going after citizens.
[00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:47.467]  Well, what's interesting is I don't, you know, I've done a lot of research into what's been going on and it hasn't just been limited to checkpoints.
[00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:57.791]  If you look on my website, the checkpointusa.org, you'll also find various documents from the... No, it's not org, they put comma on my sheet, I'm sorry.
[00:10:58.331 --> 00:10:59.992]  It's checkpointusa.org.
[00:11:00.612 --> 00:11:01.232]  Right, right.
[00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:07.815]  What you'll find is from 2007 there is a study that was done by the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:33.293]  And what he found was that on an annual basis, the Border Patrol, through the, I think it's the Office of Detention and Removal, that they were, about 33% of every illegal alien that's taken into custody on an annual basis, those individuals are re-released back into the country while awaiting deportation orders from a federal court.
[00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:38.296]  And about 75% of those individuals that have been released, they abscond.
[00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:38.996]  They run.
[00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:42.180]  And this has been an ongoing thing for years and years.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:51.950]  It's well documented, it's well known by these federal agencies, yet they take these guys into custody, they let them back into the country, and then they run.
[00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:58.834]  And then they claim that they have to conduct more internal checkpoints in order to... Terry Brassi from CheckpointUSA.org.
[00:11:59.294 --> 00:11:59.654]  Stay there.
[00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:07.678]  We're going to come right back to you after this quick break and continue discussing the important work you're doing out there defending the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.
[00:12:07.698 --> 00:12:08.799]  Stay with us, as well as the Tenth.
[00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:20.940]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.503]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:30.185]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:31.746]  It's a documented fact.
[00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:39.229]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:51.235]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:12:51.475 --> 00:12:55.137]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[00:12:55.757 --> 00:12:58.138]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:02.559]  FPP is so affordable, you can't afford to do without.
[00:13:02.619 --> 00:13:06.101]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:06.441]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:10.602]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:19.145 --> 00:13:26.208]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:32.910]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.131]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:37.692]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:37.772 --> 00:13:48.716]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:50.649]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:52.410]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:59.232]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:07.574]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:09.194]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:10.815]  The people strike back.
[00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:13.028]  Good day.
[00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:14.590]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.970]  March 10th, 2009.
[00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.851]  Gold open this morning at $9.1070.
[00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:18.834]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.3707, $4.6854 for the half-ounce, and $2.3427 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:14:18.854 --> 00:14:19.354]  That's $9.3707, $4.6854, and $2.3427.
[00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:34.147]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[00:14:34.287 --> 00:14:38.269]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:42.832]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[00:14:42.972 --> 00:14:48.216]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:51.498]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[00:14:51.578 --> 00:14:55.121]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust and confidence?
[00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:57.062]  Or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[00:14:57.202 --> 00:15:02.324]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.946]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:06.766]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:07.667]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:13.363 --> 00:15:18.825]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:19.385]  and the world.
[00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:23.106]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:29.748]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:31.809]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:39.991]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:44.695]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:50.499]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:52.801]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:15:52.961 --> 00:15:55.203]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:15:55.543 --> 00:15:58.005]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[00:16:33.198 --> 00:16:34.759]  Webster Tarpley coming up with key info.
[00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:41.963]  Keith Bryan from Ireland with the inside job going on over there shooting military and police.
[00:16:45.825 --> 00:16:50.148]  Chess Kane joining us to talk about micro FM transmitters that are totally legal to go out three miles.
[00:16:50.868 --> 00:16:51.769]  FCC approved.
[00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.771]  Terry Bressi from CheckpointUSA.org.
[00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:01.900]  Please continue, sir, with specifically people who haven't seen the videos yet at your site.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.901]  I mean, the type of hell you go through just declaring your rights to the Border Patrol when you're nowhere near the border.
[00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:08.421]  Sure.
[00:17:09.602 --> 00:17:14.403]  Well, it could be a pretty intimidating experience as some of the checkpoint videos there show.
[00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:25.165]  These agents, from my perspective, are minimally trained to understand the proper scope of their authority and the rights of the individuals that they're actually stopping there.
[00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:25.709]  I'm
[00:17:45.458 --> 00:18:03.472]  The basis of how I respond when I come up to these checkpoints is that as an individual, as an American, I have a right to travel within my own country without being impeded or molested by federal agents, unless they have a reason to believe that I've either harmed somebody else or that I've damaged property.
[00:18:04.713 --> 00:18:05.374]  Those are the basis.
[00:18:05.614 --> 00:18:11.999]  It's a hallmark of a free country to be able to travel freely without having to explain who you are,
[00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:16.779]  Where you're going, why you're going there, or any of those other things.
[00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:26.662]  And these internal checkpoints are a direct challenge to the rights of individuals to travel freely within their own country.
[00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:40.065]  And so as I approach these checkpoints, the agents oftentimes, they stop you, they want to know your citizenship, they want to see your documentation.
[00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:47.093]  And, um, what I ask them is whether or not I'm being detained and whether or not I'm free to go.
[00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:56.261]  And oftentimes, as you watch the checkpoint videos, what you'll see is that, uh, I'll ask if I'm being detained and the agent will say, no, you're not being detained.
[00:18:56.721 --> 00:19:07.791]  Well, if you understand what detained means, that means that you're engaged in a consensual, um, interaction with the law enforcement officer and either party can break off that interaction, um, at their leisure.
[00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:08.932]  So,
[00:19:09.873 --> 00:19:13.376]  If I'm not being detained, then that follows that I must be free to go.
[00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:16.739]  But when I seek that clarification and I ask them, am I free to go?
[00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:19.701]  They'll say, no, you cannot leave until you answer our questions.
[00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:20.922]  So it's color of law.
[00:19:20.942 --> 00:19:25.746]  They want you to violate your 4th and 5th Amendment, your 10th Amendment, state's rights, 9th Amendment being violated.
[00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:30.449]  And so they hold you in this color of law, no man's land, or this purgatory.
[00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:31.430]  Right.
[00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.910]  Right.
[00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:32.931]  Exactly.
[00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:36.314]  And it becomes a waiting game, if you will.
[00:19:36.474 --> 00:19:38.736]  You know, I'm pretty sure I've done a lot of research on the law.
[00:19:40.152 --> 00:19:46.474]  I've written about it a lot, I've spoken about it a lot, and I'm pretty sure with regards to what my rights are here.
[00:19:47.214 --> 00:19:55.056]  And so I'll just wait them out until they either get tired of messing with me or their supervisors.
[00:19:55.416 --> 00:19:56.976]  And this is what's quite interesting now.
[00:19:57.016 --> 00:19:59.277]  Like I said, I've been to this checkpoint about 70 times now.
[00:20:00.854 --> 00:20:11.479]  You know, 75% of the time, the agents that are on duty are smart enough to understand their limited scope and my rights, and they just wade me through.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:19.884]  But 25% of the time, you get an agent who doesn't like the fact that someone isn't, you know, basically kissing their feet.
[00:20:19.904 --> 00:20:20.224]  So they try to
[00:20:25.422 --> 00:20:25.842]  I think?
[00:20:55.515 --> 00:21:01.006]  Now the courts have recognized that Border Patrol agents have the authority at the border when someone is trying to come into the country.
[00:21:01.414 --> 00:21:03.575]  But they have the authority to indefinitely decay the economy.
[00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:06.615]  Yeah, but the bigger issue, the feds aren't doing anything to stop illegals.
[00:21:06.635 --> 00:21:10.936]  They'd arrest a few thousand businesses a year of the tens of millions for token PR.
[00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.277]  They'd do loopholes for the illegal aliens.
[00:21:13.317 --> 00:21:14.897]  It's clear they're targeting the citizens.
[00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:24.000]  I mean, if there was really a huge federal program, which is actually one of the three things the feds can actually do, to really expel the illegal aliens or go after them, then they were doing this.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.160]  And we saw results
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.862]  Then in court, still you can shoot it down.
[00:21:28.922 --> 00:21:37.108]  But clearly, this is a fishing expedition to expand unconstitutional authority across the United States in areas of more than two-thirds of the nation.
[00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:45.894]  I want to come back and briefly finish up with you, then go ahead and get our next guest online as well, sir, but I want to talk more about how folks can check out what you're doing and duplicate what you're doing at Checkpoint
[00:21:46.454 --> 00:21:49.895]  USA.org with our guest, Terry Bresci.
[00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:57.998]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, ArnoldExposed.com, TheObamaDeception.net.
[00:21:59.278 --> 00:22:00.539]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:02.539]  There's a lot going on in the background, by the way.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.260]  We're on the march.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.361]  The empire's on the run.
[00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:09.962]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:16.908]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[00:22:17.248 --> 00:22:20.529]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:24.270]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[00:22:24.711 --> 00:22:27.612]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[00:22:27.952 --> 00:22:35.535]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology that holds in and reflects your own body heat.
[00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:36.095]  We're good to go!
[00:22:55.606 --> 00:22:56.526]  Call them today at 1-877-747-6664.
[00:22:56.566 --> 00:22:56.786]  That's 1-877-747-6664.
[00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:58.367]  Or visit them online at solartherm.ca.
[00:22:58.387 --> 00:22:59.607]  That's solar, T-H-E-R-M, solartherm.ca.
[00:22:59.627 --> 00:23:03.328]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:19.645 --> 00:23:24.989]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:31.714]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:32.014 --> 00:23:33.836]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:36.378]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:47.346]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:50.918]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:52.699]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.525]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:07.851]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:09.492]  The Obama Deception.
[00:24:09.913 --> 00:24:11.174]  The people strike back.
[00:24:12.855 --> 00:24:15.437]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:24:16.047 --> 00:24:19.029]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:24:19.389 --> 00:24:22.810]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:29.354]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:34.796]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:24:34.957 --> 00:24:41.660]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.861]  Need something more?
[00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:46.726]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:24:47.026 --> 00:24:55.095]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[00:25:03.422 --> 00:25:05.103]  That's 1-800-313-6400 for all of your self-defense needs today.
[00:25:05.123 --> 00:25:06.783]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:25:26.952 --> 00:25:37.096]  You know, I can't talk about what's going on behind the scenes right now here, but I'll tell you this, ladies and gentlemen, they do not want the Obama deception to come out.
[00:25:37.476 --> 00:25:40.858]  I'm gonna tell you right now, look for launch in the next 12 hours.
[00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:45.500]  Let me tell you, this stuff's real.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:53.483]  The threats, the intimidation, the things we go through here, they confirm everything we know about the enemy.
[00:25:55.802 --> 00:25:56.362]  It doesn't matter.
[00:25:57.843 --> 00:25:59.664]  You're only alive once, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:00.664 --> 00:26:04.105]  The enemy knows the sleeping giant that is liberty and freedom is rising.
[00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:06.286]  They know you have power.
[00:26:07.367 --> 00:26:09.407]  That's why they're trying to block us every way they have.
[00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:14.209]  So I will tell everybody right now, the Obama deception is going to drop.
[00:26:14.229 --> 00:26:16.110]  It's probably dropping today.
[00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.991]  Get ready at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:18.031 --> 00:26:19.131]  I'm being forced to do this.
[00:26:21.252 --> 00:26:22.713]  Because we may not have a chance if we wait.
[00:26:23.213 --> 00:26:25.234]  And I'm showing my hand to the enemies listening right now.
[00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:27.948]  Launch the operation.
[00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:28.349]  Launch it.
[00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:29.289]  Launch it at all sites.
[00:26:29.489 --> 00:26:30.390]  Just go ahead and launch it.
[00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.190]  Launch it right now.
[00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.050]  I just made that decision.
[00:26:32.531 --> 00:26:33.791]  Launch the operation right now.
[00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:36.412]  We'll only have two or three versions of it up for everybody.
[00:26:39.774 --> 00:26:41.275]  I wish the public knew how real this was.
[00:26:48.298 --> 00:26:50.199]  Terry Bresci, you're on the air.
[00:26:55.562 --> 00:26:55.762]  Yes.
[00:26:57.934 --> 00:27:02.536]  What I can recommend to other folks is that A, folks have to know what their rights are.
[00:27:02.556 --> 00:27:05.337]  B, they have to be willing to assert them.
[00:27:06.197 --> 00:27:07.798]  And C, you have to be willing to defend them.
[00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:20.022]  And in today's climate, I think people realize now that one of the most effective ways that you can defend your rights when you're asserting them in front of a law enforcement officer is to record your interaction.
[00:27:20.042 --> 00:27:25.824]  So if you're not doing anything wrong, and you're being intimidated or coerced,
[00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:43.043]  By a law enforcement officer at a random stop, either walking down the street or driving a vehicle down the road, the best thing that you can do to protect your rights is to record your interaction and be willing and able to make that recording available to the public at large.
[00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:47.146]  It's amazing how powerful
[00:27:49.008 --> 00:27:58.091]  Basic tools that are available to any consumer in the marketplace today can be used to help you defend your rights and what you think is important in today's day and age.
[00:27:58.851 --> 00:28:04.113]  And this is the technique that I use when I encounter suspicious checkpoints.
[00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:10.795]  I know my rights, I assert them, and I defend them by making a recording of those checkpoint stops and then posting them online.
[00:28:11.255 --> 00:28:17.636]  So people can see for themselves exactly what's happening, who's doing it, and why they claim they're doing it.
[00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:20.337]  That's right, and dead men tell no tales.
[00:28:20.837 --> 00:28:24.038]  So it's always important to get your information out, then you're somewhat protected.
[00:28:25.278 --> 00:28:26.858]  You've done this quite a few times.
[00:28:26.878 --> 00:28:34.060]  How many times have you been stopped by these people at their warrantless checkpoints and presented the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence?
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.160]  How many times, roughly?
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.081]  Well, I've been stopped at this checkpoint about 70 times in the last year.
[00:28:41.417 --> 00:28:42.719]  And this has been going on for six years.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.704]  Well, this particular checkpoint has been in place for just over a year.
[00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:50.767]  You said since 2002, though, you've been going through this.
[00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:54.071]  Well, 2002 was my first experience.
[00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:55.953]  In 2005, I had a couple more.
[00:28:55.973 --> 00:28:59.417]  They were just doing them temporarily, like every once in a while they would pop up.
[00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.912]  But in 2008, January 2008, they changed how they were conducting them.
[00:29:04.272 --> 00:29:12.235]  Instead of doing them at random times in random places, they set up along one specific location on the highway, and they left it open 24-7.
[00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:18.918]  So it's been open since January, early January of 2008, and it's been ongoing all that time.
[00:29:19.378 --> 00:29:24.541]  So in the past, I had missed a fair amount because they weren't being done on any kind of a steady basis.
[00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:27.582]  But now they're being done constantly.
[00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:32.866]  And so every time that I travel that road, it's guaranteed that I'll have to go through this particular checkpoint.
[00:29:35.908 --> 00:29:37.188]  Just incredible, my friend.
[00:29:37.428 --> 00:29:38.429]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:43.551]  Well, as this continues to develop, we will continue to check in with you at CheckpointUSA.org.
[00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:45.752]  And I want to thank Terry Bresci for coming on with us today.
[00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:47.473]  Thank you.
[00:29:48.273 --> 00:29:49.213]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:29:50.094 --> 00:29:50.654]  Okay.
[00:29:53.575 --> 00:29:54.976]  It's hard to continue on here.
[00:29:58.166 --> 00:29:59.066]  On the air right now.
[00:30:01.808 --> 00:30:06.910]  And, uh, just so sick of the New World Order.
[00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.011]  I'm sick of all their crap.
[00:30:08.871 --> 00:30:09.712]  But we know who they are.
[00:30:09.772 --> 00:30:10.552]  We know what they are.
[00:30:10.592 --> 00:30:11.532]  We know what has to be done.
[00:30:11.553 --> 00:30:16.975]  I just wish people valued how serious and how real this information is.
[00:30:16.995 --> 00:30:20.457]  I know a lot of you do, but sometimes I think I don't value it because, you know, I live it.
[00:30:20.517 --> 00:30:20.917]  I breathe it.
[00:30:21.577 --> 00:30:22.778]  I'm in this fight constantly.
[00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.893]  For other people it's like some social thing or it's like fun.
[00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:36.479]  It's fun to fight and defeat evil but it's not fun working this hard.
[00:30:36.499 --> 00:30:38.541]  It's not fun looking at these horrors all day.
[00:30:38.561 --> 00:30:46.590]  It's not fun knowing you're right and just seeing the evil continue and grow and just get worse and all the people it hurts and just all of it.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:57.670]  Bernie Madoff out stealing and all the rest of them stealing and the banks openly looting everything and setting up world government and trumpeting it and every major newspaper saying how great it is.
[00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:04.317]  And still have people telling me the New World Order doesn't exist because they were following the pre-programmed brainwashing.
[00:31:22.196 --> 00:31:28.400]  You know, I got a bunch of trailers coming out for the Obama Deception, some promos, some sneak peeks and things that were supposed to start coming out in the next two days.
[00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:48.915]  You know, for the film to have its full effect, it needs to do that, but um... You know, the establishment... The FBI has a lot of dirty tricks, and they, under their Patriot Act, with their sneak and peek things, they can tell you, under federal law, that
[00:31:50.981 --> 00:31:53.002]  You're not even supposed to tell people what's going on.
[00:31:56.445 --> 00:31:59.707]  That's what this country has turned into, is a Soviet dirt pit.
[00:32:01.027 --> 00:32:04.910]  They talk about the blacklist for the communists, that's nothing compared to what patriots go through.
[00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.592]  There are congressional hearings!
[00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:16.082]  Where they show architects and engineers for 9-11 truth next to Al Qaeda training videos and say the web has to be shut down.
[00:32:16.302 --> 00:32:20.324]  And they're having big Pentagon cyber security takeovers of the entire web.
[00:32:20.344 --> 00:32:25.707]  And the former head of Homeland Security, Cyber Security has resigned saying it's a total takeover.
[00:32:26.107 --> 00:32:30.550]  They admit NORTHCOM and the Pentagon and everything else is for the American people!
[00:32:34.178 --> 00:32:45.423]  Tommy Chong tried to put out a film, aka Tommy Chong, about how they set him up and what they did to him, and they raided the film distribution center when the DVDs came in, and they confiscated them.
[00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.623]  Now, that blew up in their face.
[00:32:48.844 --> 00:32:52.526]  That blew up in their face, and the film went on Showtime and international television.
[00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:58.028]  And fortune favors the bold, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:03.422 --> 00:33:05.243]  But I am sick and tired of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.323 --> 00:33:11.568]  I told you that when I took on Obama, this was serious, that I was going up against their biggest, baddest gladiator.
[00:33:12.028 --> 00:33:17.752]  And all of the throngs of soulless minions he's got, and those that do have souls but are deceived.
[00:33:20.894 --> 00:33:32.883]  And the threats my wife gets, the threats I get, is nothing compared to the snake itself snooping around and trying to shut down what we are doing here.
[00:33:38.928 --> 00:33:42.349]  They know the Obama deception is the truth.
[00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:44.670]  They know that we understand their agenda.
[00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.471]  We know how to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:48.092]  We know how to beat these people.
[00:33:49.752 --> 00:33:53.334]  Our information is going super-total-nova right now.
[00:33:53.794 --> 00:34:03.397]  And I'm going to tell the enemy, you picked the wrong side with the New World Order and we're going to take this country back and the tyrants and the treasonous, lecherous people will be brought to justice through courts of law.
[00:34:03.758 --> 00:34:04.158]  Know that.
[00:34:05.134 --> 00:34:10.136]  Just like Hitler's Germany, this tyranny will fall probably before it ever gets launched to the level that Hitler was able to carry out.
[00:34:11.377 --> 00:34:13.978]  The globalists just do their killing in third world nations with our troops.
[00:34:28.044 --> 00:34:29.865]  The Obama deception, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.661]  You need to see it.
[00:34:33.061 --> 00:34:33.842]  You need to have it.
[00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:35.263]  You need to get it out to everyone.
[00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:37.704]  And you need to remember that the enemy is scared of it.
[00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:44.690]  That Obama has an enemies list and you can better believe I'm on it.
[00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:50.494]  And most of all everybody needs to pray for what we do here.
[00:34:50.554 --> 00:34:51.495]  Pray for this ministry.
[00:34:51.535 --> 00:34:53.897]  It is a ministry of truth to the people of the world.
[00:34:54.277 --> 00:34:54.637]  A light.
[00:34:55.338 --> 00:34:56.759]  A lighthouse in these stormy times.
[00:34:58.809 --> 00:35:03.032]  Another way to get the word out is why I have this gentleman on for about ten minutes, Chess Kane.
[00:35:05.653 --> 00:35:17.020]  We were made aware of, separately from Chess Kane, by ham radio operators and others, of the best AM made right here in the U.S.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:22.123]  that with the proper antenna goes out three miles strong and is FCC legal.
[00:35:23.046 --> 00:35:23.867]  It's all civil anyways.
[00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:24.747]  FCC's civil.
[00:35:24.807 --> 00:35:25.848]  It follows the regulations.
[00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:28.991]  And if you put up signs in a dense area, you can reach tens of thousands.
[00:35:29.051 --> 00:35:29.931]  In rural areas, hundreds.
[00:35:30.272 --> 00:35:32.113]  And you just put up signs for the AM.
[00:35:32.133 --> 00:35:33.054]  You plug it into the internet.
[00:35:33.074 --> 00:35:34.335]  You stream my show, other shows.
[00:35:34.395 --> 00:35:46.785]  If my show isn't here... And... You get the information out.
[00:35:48.769 --> 00:35:57.514]  You get the information out, and someday when there's not even an internet if they're successful, you can tape the shows, play them back, you can get on the air yourself.
[00:35:57.814 --> 00:35:58.214]  That's what you do.
[00:35:58.234 --> 00:36:01.296]  You run it 24 hours a day, get an audience and do your own hour show every day or whatever you want.
[00:36:03.377 --> 00:36:04.658]  And it's a powerful tool.
[00:36:05.518 --> 00:36:09.821]  Now, when you call up Ches Kane, because I know I've talked to him, we'll try to give you all the technicals.
[00:36:09.841 --> 00:36:10.601]  It isn't that hard.
[00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:13.463]  You just get the basic equipment, hook it up, plug it in the internet, get going.
[00:36:16.542 --> 00:36:22.446]  So I would call Chess Cane and I would get this system.
[00:36:22.687 --> 00:36:23.587]  Very inexpensive.
[00:36:23.627 --> 00:36:27.050]  I happen to know they're selling it basically at near cost, which I think is a mistake for them.
[00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.431]  You need to be able to fund your own operation.
[00:36:29.111 --> 00:36:30.452]  Trutham.com.
[00:36:30.512 --> 00:36:31.793]  Trutham.com.
[00:36:32.434 --> 00:36:35.196]  Because we then approached the makers of it and they said, look, we're too busy.
[00:36:35.216 --> 00:36:35.856]  We're engineers.
[00:36:35.876 --> 00:36:37.217]  We've made scores of products.
[00:36:38.338 --> 00:36:44.603]  And then we went out and found folks that were sub-sellers who did want to get them and sell them.
[00:36:45.947 --> 00:36:49.668]  So, that's why there's a little banner on InfoWars, but this is not a paid interview right now.
[00:36:49.688 --> 00:36:50.828]  I have them on because I believe in it.
[00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:54.249]  Chess Kane, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:57.630]  In the dark days of the Republic, this transmitter is what people need, isn't it?
[00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.551]  It sure is, and thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:37:00.731 --> 00:37:04.412]  I actually grew up across the other side of the lake from you over there in Dallas.
[00:37:05.612 --> 00:37:06.532]  Lake Ray Hubbard, huh?
[00:37:06.872 --> 00:37:09.513]  Yeah, just right there by Bryan Adams High School.
[00:37:09.533 --> 00:37:13.774]  So I know about this, and those calls you had about an hour ago is discouraging.
[00:37:15.341 --> 00:37:21.925]  That's the low of the low, and that's what keeps me pulling through this stuff, because there's a lot of good people that are in this trying to make this work.
[00:37:23.406 --> 00:37:34.953]  That Red Beckman interview you had a while back, it got me to get his book, The Walls in Our Minds, and it tells the difference between politicians and statesmen, and I decided I want to be a statesman, and that's why I did this.
[00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:41.617]  The inspiration from that in your Waco video, most people probably haven't seen that one,
[00:37:42.236 --> 00:37:48.959]  But it does show what one man can do, and it taught me that we... I was involved in the neocon side.
[00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:50.900]  I was going to school at DeVry when that happened.
[00:37:51.761 --> 00:37:56.343]  And I finally woke up to it, and I said, if they can do Waco, anything's possible.
[00:37:56.823 --> 00:37:58.324]  Oklahoma City is the easiest one.
[00:37:58.344 --> 00:38:01.766]  So let me just tell you what this radio station has done for me in this area.
[00:38:01.786 --> 00:38:02.966]  I'm in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 150,000 people.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:15.426]  Just last weekend I played Pat Shannon's Oklahoma City documentary, and I also played one from Chris Emery with a 20 minute clip of yours, and I had maximum listenership.
[00:38:15.486 --> 00:38:19.289]  I had calls, I had emails, I want this video, give me this information.
[00:38:20.649 --> 00:38:23.331]  That is waking people up, and I can get it on the air.
[00:38:24.412 --> 00:38:31.096]  This is what one transmitter is doing, but you've also learned how to then have somebody at the edge pick it up with an antenna and put it back out.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:40.667]  Yeah, like one spot, we link two of them together and it shoots right up a main street and I'm putting a video up today that people can actually see me in the car demonstrating that just so they can see that.
[00:38:41.007 --> 00:38:48.633]  Okay, now if you just hook it up and don't do it right, it might go half a mile, but if you hook it up right, a little energy into it, three miles is what I'm told?
[00:38:49.173 --> 00:38:57.980]  Well, you're going to get a solid daytime one mile coverage if you do it an average, but if you really sit down and do it right and maybe get some help,
[00:38:58.721 --> 00:38:59.141]  Uh, yes.
[00:38:59.381 --> 00:38:59.902]  Three miles.
[00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:03.424]  I have a guy in Omaha that can pick up our Omaha transmitter three and a half miles away.
[00:39:03.444 --> 00:39:05.765]  He recorded it and emailed me the recording back.
[00:39:05.785 --> 00:39:06.705]  So that was verified.
[00:39:07.826 --> 00:39:11.308]  And, uh, it's a, it's a FCC certified unit.
[00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.169]  That means the FCC looked at the unit.
[00:39:14.029 --> 00:39:19.192]  Uh, the FCC said, yes, this unit when set at the proper level will not cause interference.
[00:39:19.772 --> 00:39:26.896]  And their statement basically is if you use one of these units, no one's going to bother you as long as we just don't want to know that you're there.
[00:39:27.452 --> 00:39:27.933]  We're good to go.
[00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:34.917]  You know, that's what you do with it.
[00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:41.600]  Well, these are such micro-units, too, that it's, I mean, maybe one out of a billion, and then it's FCC-approved, so there's no problem.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:46.002]  Uh, you know, FMs, you go up with 100 watts or something and go out 20, 30 miles, you know.
[00:39:46.182 --> 00:39:48.583]  Folks keep their mouth shut about that, nothing really happens.
[00:39:48.643 --> 00:39:57.628]  But the point is, this is FCC-approved for general use, and you just find a clean, open spot on the dials, there's not interference, the widest spot you can.
[00:39:58.508 --> 00:40:03.709]  Uh, and then you just put up little paper signs all around the listening area and it explodes.
[00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.150]  Well, here's the neatest thing about it.
[00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:13.032]  Since I put this up, remember how a while back, you know, the people that were involved in the Ron Paul group, they lost steam and they kind of dispersed?
[00:40:13.552 --> 00:40:19.894]  Well, this has kind of kept everybody together and now we've seen eugenics right in our face here in South Dakota.
[00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:24.655]  So we've used this system to show people what's going on up here.
[00:40:25.316 --> 00:40:27.958]  And now we're writing in the newspapers, people are getting involved.
[00:40:28.318 --> 00:40:35.023]  Even one of the state representatives who voted the wrong way, she's now coming out and saying, the Department of... It's like a match.
[00:40:35.603 --> 00:40:38.205]  One little match can burn down the entire forest.
[00:40:38.265 --> 00:40:40.207]  Well, what did Thomas Jefferson say?
[00:40:40.527 --> 00:40:41.468]  These are good fires.
[00:40:42.068 --> 00:40:46.872]  One person can set bushfires in the minds of men that will sweep the globe.
[00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:48.433]  And so these are
[00:40:49.093 --> 00:40:51.456]  Powerful incendiaries in the Infowar.
[00:40:51.776 --> 00:40:56.241]  People need to call you and get ready to go to the website TruthAM.com.
[00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:58.263]  Just TruthAM, like AM radio.
[00:40:58.303 --> 00:41:00.465]  TruthAM.com or call 800-579-0580 after the interview.
[00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:11.432]  And we need hams and people that are, it isn't hard to hook up folks, but you know somebody like me who has problem programming a VCR, I might have a problem.
[00:41:11.752 --> 00:41:13.753]  The point is get it, set it up, get it done.
[00:41:13.773 --> 00:41:15.274]  Especially people that have a little bit of skill.
[00:41:15.674 --> 00:41:16.935]  Get the unit now.
[00:41:17.095 --> 00:41:17.815]  Don't wait.
[00:41:18.115 --> 00:41:19.656]  There's only one guy there selling them.
[00:41:19.676 --> 00:41:22.037]  He's selling them basically at cost, because I know what these things cost.
[00:41:22.057 --> 00:41:23.117]  We looked at selling them ourselves.
[00:41:23.137 --> 00:41:23.337]  800-579-0580.
[00:41:23.357 --> 00:41:23.457]  800-579-0580.
[00:41:23.477 --> 00:41:24.598]  And get the things up this week.
[00:41:32.882 --> 00:41:33.682]  Don't wait, folks.
[00:41:33.982 --> 00:41:34.383]  Go ahead.
[00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:35.643]  One quick point.
[00:41:35.683 --> 00:41:37.364]  We've got 25 of them ready to go.
[00:41:37.884 --> 00:41:41.346]  What happens, the typical thing, people start evaluating these other transmitters.
[00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:42.947]  I did that for two years.
[00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:49.211]  All the kids are going to spend time after time trying to make it work.
[00:41:49.711 --> 00:41:50.151]  These work.
[00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:51.372]  They're ready to go.
[00:41:52.708 --> 00:42:01.100]  Yeah, that's how you found the company that we'd separately found, because we were, you know, snooping around trying to find a good AM that was legal to give people.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:08.250]  And all you do is plug it into the internet, folks, or plug it into whatever you want, and blast it out, and then you've got an audience, because you're playing Genesis or whatever.
[00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:15.215]  And then you start getting, or audiophiles, or preachers you like, or whatever it is you want to put out.
[00:42:15.615 --> 00:42:21.058]  And then you've got an audience there in just a few weeks when you put signs up of hundreds, if not thousands, and then boom, you're hitting them.
[00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:22.158]  People want the truth.
[00:42:22.178 --> 00:42:27.141]  And when they find out what's on that AM dial, it's incredible.
[00:42:27.161 --> 00:42:27.441]  Go ahead.
[00:42:27.742 --> 00:42:31.043]  Well, the beauty is the quality of these is such a high level.
[00:42:31.544 --> 00:42:33.825]  It's such a small box, but when you actually put it on the air,
[00:42:34.686 --> 00:42:41.531]  You're quite astonished yourself, just how well it sounds, and it just sends a shiver up your spine.
[00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:44.953]  Doing that is the question you'll ask yourself.
[00:42:45.093 --> 00:42:48.296]  Folks are already calling you right now, one of these 25 transmitters.
[00:42:48.936 --> 00:42:50.797]  Look, I want thousands of these to go out.
[00:42:51.258 --> 00:42:53.099]  We'll keep in touch.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.061]  All right, yeah, we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:57.462]  I'm going to let you get to those phone calls.
[00:42:57.902 --> 00:42:59.644]  Thank you so much for joining us, Chess.
[00:43:00.504 --> 00:43:01.405]  Good luck to you, bye-bye.
[00:43:01.825 --> 00:43:02.766]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:08.366]  Again, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com!
[00:43:08.386 --> 00:43:09.952]  Get the info war going in your area!
[00:43:13.354 --> 00:43:15.195]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:43:15.335 --> 00:43:20.516]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:43:20.696 --> 00:43:22.017]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:43:22.297 --> 00:43:30.459]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:43:30.699 --> 00:43:36.421]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:43:36.581 --> 00:43:38.383]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:43:38.423 --> 00:43:40.585]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:43:40.605 --> 00:43:44.969]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:43:45.149 --> 00:43:47.271]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:43:47.371 --> 00:43:55.118]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:43:55.558 --> 00:43:55.959]  We're good.
[00:44:13.382 --> 00:44:18.686]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:19.187 --> 00:44:26.193]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:32.974]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:33.354 --> 00:44:35.195]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:35.335 --> 00:44:37.756]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:37.836 --> 00:44:48.763]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:50.704]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:51.084 --> 00:44:52.445]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:52.944 --> 00:44:59.266]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:59.846 --> 00:45:07.629]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:09.249]  The Obama Deception.
[00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:10.950]  The people strike back.
[00:45:14.451 --> 00:45:16.432]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:45:17.032 --> 00:45:19.473]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:45:20.092 --> 00:45:24.273]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.761]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:30.162]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:45:30.523 --> 00:45:33.524]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:45:33.844 --> 00:45:45.209]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:51.692]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[00:45:51.772 --> 00:45:52.573]  We're good to go.
[00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:50.111]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears the hole
[00:46:52.373 --> 00:47:11.308]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[00:47:14.451 --> 00:47:16.432]  My sweetest friend
[00:47:19.251 --> 00:47:32.243]  Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all
[00:47:49.192 --> 00:47:51.535]  Go ahead and get a Webster Tarpley on John up in Minnesota.
[00:47:51.555 --> 00:47:55.561]  I've been popping in for about 10 minutes with him.
[00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:57.303]  At the end of the interview we're going to go to Ireland.
[00:47:57.323 --> 00:47:59.005]  It's just all right here.
[00:47:59.045 --> 00:48:02.831]  Even mainstream news basically admitting it's an inside job.
[00:48:02.851 --> 00:48:05.855]  With them killing the military and police over in Ireland right now.
[00:48:10.036 --> 00:48:11.237]  Oh, it is insane.
[00:48:11.277 --> 00:48:12.257]  We had Ron Paul on today.
[00:48:12.277 --> 00:48:13.218]  An amazing interview.
[00:48:13.238 --> 00:48:16.340]  So many key stories we can write about that and get the word out.
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.981]  What we do is we have Ron Paul on.
[00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:18.841]  He covers all these issues.
[00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:19.862]  All the Ron Paul supporters.
[00:48:20.262 --> 00:48:21.923]  Then check out the things he covers here.
[00:48:21.943 --> 00:48:23.904]  A lot of things he doesn't get asked by the mainstream media.
[00:48:24.645 --> 00:48:26.005]  And it sends shockwaves out.
[00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:29.527]  You know, that's our job is to set bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:48:30.168 --> 00:48:32.029]  That's why I had TruthAM.com on.
[00:48:33.663 --> 00:48:44.813]  You know, I got all these sponsors, too, and I usually do two, three hours of show and forget about them and then cram them all in here at the end, but it is sponsors that we have a whole other hour coming up, though, that make this show possible.
[00:48:47.856 --> 00:48:49.557]  One of them is Pmemory.net.
[00:48:49.917 --> 00:48:50.978]  It's a great system.
[00:48:51.038 --> 00:48:55.683]  It's just the classical systems that really work to increase your memory.
[00:48:56.923 --> 00:49:01.206]  You spend all this time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information can you actually recall?
[00:49:01.266 --> 00:49:02.466]  Test yourself right now.
[00:49:02.887 --> 00:49:05.028]  Try to recall the show aired one week ago.
[00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:08.510]  How about two weeks ago?
[00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:12.673]  And if you cannot recall it, then what's the point?
[00:49:14.033 --> 00:49:17.956]  School of Phenomenal Memory, pmemory.net.
[00:49:19.917 --> 00:49:24.660]  And, you know, I focus all day researching documents and information, and it made my memory even better over the years.
[00:49:28.612 --> 00:49:30.473]  Proven results from the lesson.
[00:49:30.493 --> 00:49:30.973]  Guaranteed.
[00:49:31.033 --> 00:49:32.274]  No gimmicks or magic pills.
[00:49:32.534 --> 00:49:34.595]  Pure science and real training that makes sense.
[00:49:34.655 --> 00:49:39.517]  Memorize what you read, what you really need, such as daily tasks, new languages, and even entire books.
[00:49:39.897 --> 00:49:42.518]  Dramatically improve natural memory, attention, and thinking speed.
[00:49:42.778 --> 00:49:44.179]  The School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:45.360]  www.pmemory.net
[00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.291]  Also, another fine sponsor.
[00:49:52.311 --> 00:49:53.532]  I mean, what do I say about this company?
[00:49:53.572 --> 00:49:55.353]  Ecolablue, Ecolablue.com.
[00:49:56.494 --> 00:49:59.456]  Great atmospheric water generator, seven and a half gallons a day out of the air.
[00:50:00.216 --> 00:50:03.979]  Inside your house or out on the porch, whatever, it grabs it, puts it through seven different filters.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:12.504]  Among the filters is UV, charcoal, reverse osmosis, other filters, no chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:50:12.884 --> 00:50:14.966]  Neutral pH, your own source of clean drinking water.
[00:50:15.166 --> 00:50:16.287]  Hook it up to a little solar panel.
[00:50:16.307 --> 00:50:17.267]  Another great system.
[00:50:17.307 --> 00:50:19.269]  Ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-L-B-L-U-E.
[00:50:20.259 --> 00:50:21.899]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with
[00:50:45.526 --> 00:50:51.912]  Hour number four, as we go straight into the New World Order, straight through and beyond.
[00:50:54.355 --> 00:50:56.197]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:50:57.858 --> 00:51:00.181]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:51:02.585 --> 00:51:04.167]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:04.267 --> 00:51:08.914]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:09.014 --> 00:51:11.778]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:11.978 --> 00:51:14.862]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:15.042 --> 00:51:19.769]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:19.969 --> 00:51:20.909]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:21.089 --> 00:51:24.071]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:31.234]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:31.314 --> 00:51:34.455]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:34.595 --> 00:51:34.875]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:37.276 --> 00:51:39.537]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:49.600]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.120]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.720]  Take action today.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.581]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:52:05.586 --> 00:52:07.508]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:07.988 --> 00:52:10.751]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:30.405 --> 00:52:35.989]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, in defense of the republic you have found at the tip of the spear in the Info War.
[00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.511]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:40.992]  to 3 p.m.
[00:52:41.092 --> 00:52:42.473]  by the grace of God.
[00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:48.717]  We have told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but that truth.
[00:52:51.258 --> 00:52:58.403]  The Obama deception, I am very, very tempted to go ahead and release it and not wait till Sunday because time is short.
[00:53:01.104 --> 00:53:04.105]  The dirty tricks going on against us are legion.
[00:53:05.546 --> 00:53:08.447]  And that tells me that we are very close to victory.
[00:53:09.047 --> 00:53:09.848]  I smell victory.
[00:53:11.769 --> 00:53:14.810]  Webster Tarpley, he wrote an article about Obamaville.
[00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.731]  More and more tent cities sprouting up.
[00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:34.604]  He is now announcing that they will take the core of these millions of volunteers and have them march around door-to-door, canvassing support for Obama and his agenda, literally pushing for an open world government run for and by the central banks, a new special court they run where they will try people like Bernie Madoff, the new private banking court.
[00:53:35.425 --> 00:53:36.185]  It's all happening!
[00:53:37.086 --> 00:53:41.828]  Right now, I'm sure you've noticed, I keep saying this every day, every week, but now it's becoming more and more insane by the minute.
[00:53:42.548 --> 00:53:46.589]  We have so many people waking up right now, so many people listening.
[00:53:46.749 --> 00:53:48.430]  It's the majority of those we're able to reach.
[00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:49.870]  The question is, how do we reach people?
[00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:53.331]  The listeners have to get your books and my films and materials out to folks.
[00:53:56.212 --> 00:54:00.494]  But to go directly over the target and all the flack is also
[00:54:01.556 --> 00:54:02.617]  Also extremely daunting.
[00:54:02.637 --> 00:54:05.398]  Webster Tarpley, it's good to have you here with us.
[00:54:06.059 --> 00:54:07.079]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:12.202]  I am just blown away by how real all of this is.
[00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:16.485]  Just all of the corruption manifesting, the controlled depression, all of it.
[00:54:17.265 --> 00:54:21.168]  Give us the latest on your analysis of what the globalists are doing and what Obama's up to.
[00:54:22.328 --> 00:54:26.471]  Well, I think there are a number of things that are changing rapidly.
[00:54:26.511 --> 00:54:28.712]  The first is this question of the Obamavilles.
[00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.193]  And I say Obamavilles
[00:54:30.987 --> 00:54:31.847]  Very deliberately.
[00:54:32.508 --> 00:54:43.232]  Back in the 1890s, in this country, we had a very severe depression, which occurred when President Grover Cleveland, remember him, a Democrat, capitulated to J.P.
[00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:47.113]  Morgan and the British and basically turned the control of the U.S.
[00:54:47.153 --> 00:54:51.455]  public debt over to London and their man Morgan in Wall Street.
[00:54:51.615 --> 00:54:56.597]  That is really the basis of the Federal Reserve, comes out of that, those events in 1895.
[00:54:57.017 --> 00:54:58.477]  That pitched the entire U.S.
[00:54:58.537 --> 00:55:00.298]  economy into a terrible depression.
[00:55:00.908 --> 00:55:05.691]  And there were bread lines for people who were lucky, and those were called Cleveland Cafes.
[00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:08.493]  So a Cleveland Cafe in the 1890s.
[00:55:08.653 --> 00:55:26.646]  In the 1930s, I think more people remember, there were these shanty towns that were known as Hoovervilles, in honor of Herbert Hoover, reactionary Republican who refused to do anything about the Depression, kept talking about the laws of the free market and how you had to wait and prosperity was just around the corner.
[00:55:27.105 --> 00:55:28.826]  And be a rugged individualist.
[00:55:28.846 --> 00:55:31.608]  That was his slogan in 1932 when he lost the election.
[00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:34.150]  So those were Herbert Hoover, Hoovervilles.
[00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:39.934]  And now we have these shantytowns, and I don't know what else you're going to call them except Obamavilles, because that's what they are.
[00:55:40.474 --> 00:55:43.896]  And they're filling up with people who are homeless.
[00:55:44.197 --> 00:55:48.520]  And we can see just the beginnings of some coverage.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:51.922]  NBC News had a story last night in their nightly news about
[00:55:52.466 --> 00:55:53.667]  About these shanty towns?
[00:55:53.707 --> 00:55:55.449]  They don't call them Obamavilles of course.
[00:56:10.265 --> 00:56:12.206]  Well, I recommend for this stopping foreclosures.
[00:56:12.226 --> 00:56:15.008]  And the way you stop foreclosures is to stop foreclosures with a federal law.
[00:56:15.028 --> 00:56:16.129]  Foreclosure must be a federal crime.
[00:56:16.169 --> 00:56:16.529]  No foreclosures.
[00:56:40.117 --> 00:56:43.940]  We've got a banking sector that has run wild for 20 years under deregulation.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.982]  Yeah, Bloomberg reported the banks have gotten $9.7 trillion.
[00:56:47.782 --> 00:56:52.226]  It's unaccounted for, and that would pay for 90 plus percent of all mortgages.
[00:56:53.747 --> 00:56:57.329]  It would be a pittance of that with the people that can prove that they can't pay their mortgages.
[00:56:57.369 --> 00:56:58.330]  It is socialism!
[00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:02.293]  They keep saying that we've got socialism, but we really don't have that.
[00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:04.314]  We have banker-looting fascism.
[00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:08.277]  And if I have a choice between banker-looting fascism and socialism, I'll take socialism.
[00:57:08.457 --> 00:57:09.338]  That's not what we're getting.
[00:57:13.152 --> 00:57:18.815]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:57:19.095 --> 00:57:23.877]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:57:24.117 --> 00:57:29.079]  Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:57:29.299 --> 00:57:32.741]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:41.408]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:57:41.749 --> 00:57:46.713]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:57:47.534 --> 00:57:53.279]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:57:53.539 --> 00:57:55.841]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:57:56.181 --> 00:57:57.982]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:18.732]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:19.232 --> 00:58:26.218]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:26.804 --> 00:58:33.026]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:33.386 --> 00:58:35.227]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:35.367 --> 00:58:37.787]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:37.868 --> 00:58:48.811]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:49.449 --> 00:58:50.730]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:52.471]  It's about a one world government.
[00:58:52.971 --> 00:58:59.314]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:59:08.138 --> 00:59:09.279]  The Obama Deception.
[00:59:09.699 --> 00:59:10.900]  The people strike back.
[00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.011]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:59:14.191 --> 00:59:16.473]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:59:16.613 --> 00:59:20.616]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:59:20.756 --> 00:59:22.818]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:59:28.084 --> 00:59:36.712]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:59:36.932 --> 00:59:43.077]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:59:43.317 --> 00:59:46.720]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:59:46.921 --> 00:59:51.064]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:59:58.410 --> 00:59:59.731]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:35.044 --> 01:00:38.406]  Webster Tarpley is our guest coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:43.008]  Tarpley will be on with us at the same time because he's very educated on all these subjects.
[01:00:44.048 --> 01:00:55.233]  Even the mainstream news is admitting, just like the shooting a week ago of the cricket team over in Pakistan, it was on surveillance cameras, witnesses saw it, the police just stood there.
[01:00:56.232 --> 01:00:58.334]  The shooters walked right past them with their guns.
[01:00:59.315 --> 01:01:00.335]  They were allowed to do that.
[01:01:01.216 --> 01:01:02.918]  Mainstream news, scores of headlines.
[01:01:02.938 --> 01:01:08.162]  We posted them up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and an article Steve Watson wrote.
[01:01:09.022 --> 01:01:11.585]  Inside job in cricket shooting goes viral.
[01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:14.854]  And so now people are aware of that.
[01:01:16.014 --> 01:01:24.421]  Also, with the thing in Northern Ireland, we said, let's see if there was a drill going on at that time, and let's see if the security forces didn't shoot back and stood down.
[01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:30.266]  It's now come out today, it's in major British papers and Irish papers and European papers, and we're going to go over that.
[01:01:30.867 --> 01:01:34.170]  Webster, digressing, and we'll go back to the Obama bills, just to
[01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:36.471]  Little foresight of what's coming up later.
[01:01:36.491 --> 01:01:45.073]  What does this sound like to you, yet again, with them shooting two members of the British military and now shooting a police officer last night, right when Ireland's starting to get more of its sovereignty?
[01:01:46.374 --> 01:01:59.518]  Well, I'm not very familiar with the details of all this because I've been paying attention to economics, but what we do know is that the British government of Gordon Brown has tremendous totalitarian ambitions.
[01:01:59.898 --> 01:02:02.419]  Gordon Brown is really the guy who started this
[01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:13.392]  The whole policy of bailouts, giving hundreds of billions of dollars or hundreds of billions of pounds to bankrupt banks in an attempt to prop up this castle of derivatives.
[01:02:14.173 --> 01:02:15.474]  He's the one who started that, right?
[01:02:15.494 --> 01:02:29.681]  That was Northern Rock going bankrupt during the second half of 2007, which was then the recipient of hundreds of billions of pounds at the end of 2007 and then nationalized in effect by the British government in the beginning
[01:02:30.316 --> 01:02:30.376]  Of 2008.
[01:02:30.876 --> 01:02:32.537]  So that's really the model.
[01:02:32.577 --> 01:02:34.778]  And they just did that again this past week.
[01:02:34.798 --> 01:02:39.941]  They nationalized Lloyd's Bank, which is one of the big clearing banks, as they call them.
[01:02:39.981 --> 01:02:46.484]  One of the four or five banks in Britain that have offices all around, you know, retail bankers.
[01:02:46.524 --> 01:02:49.305]  So Lloyd's Bank is now nationalized.
[01:02:50.046 --> 01:02:53.287]  And you can see that Gordon Brown is making policy.
[01:02:53.427 --> 01:02:55.508]  Gordon Brown was here in Washington last week.
[01:02:55.548 --> 01:02:56.709]  He addressed a joint session
[01:02:57.298 --> 01:02:57.718]  I don't think so.
[01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:21.922]  By Obama.
[01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:24.223]  And I think this is essentially baseless.
[01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:26.745]  This was a little bit of a dog and pony show, right?
[01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:33.150]  That they kind of did a charade to make it look like Obama was not working directly for Gordon Brown.
[01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.870]  But I think he is.
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:40.995]  Gordon Brown also wants $500 billion for the International Monetary Fund.
[01:03:41.055 --> 01:03:44.197]  Now, if you want to have the New World Order, that's it.
[01:03:44.578 --> 01:03:46.259]  Whatever the New World Order is going to be,
[01:03:46.832 --> 01:03:49.693]  It's going to be centered in the International Monetary Fund.
[01:03:49.813 --> 01:03:55.455]  Well, they've said that they're making their own court for Madoff and others that the bankers will run, because they're the experts.
[01:03:55.775 --> 01:03:59.697]  And it'll be a new bank of the world that you pay your carbon taxes to.
[01:03:59.777 --> 01:04:01.217]  That's now all over the news.
[01:04:01.277 --> 01:04:02.598]  I mean, more and more every day.
[01:04:02.618 --> 01:04:04.559]  I mean, it's here.
[01:04:05.379 --> 01:04:09.740]  They've called the Wall Street Journal for a North American Union to save us out of the crisis.
[01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:10.741]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:15.574]  Yeah, the International Monetary Fund is what's going to cap this entire thing.
[01:04:15.594 --> 01:04:18.956]  It'll be the apex of the entire edifice.
[01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:24.860]  And right now they want more money for bankrupt speculators in Eastern Europe and so forth.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:29.522]  I think it's also important to look at the evolution of the derivatives.
[01:04:29.862 --> 01:04:32.544]  My view of the crisis, of course, is that it's totally out of control.
[01:04:32.884 --> 01:04:38.387]  That nobody controls this crisis because it's bringing down all of their institutions one after another.
[01:04:39.383 --> 01:04:49.129]  Last week we had the big AIG story, right, that AIG had lost $62 billion in one quarter, and of course that's all derivative.
[01:04:49.169 --> 01:04:59.996]  This is a very important example, because it refutes the story that you hear from Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Hannity, and all the rest of these clowns, that the crisis was created by poor people
[01:05:00.532 --> 01:05:01.813]  Getting subprime mortgages.
[01:05:01.853 --> 01:05:07.336]  Well, that was publicly the cover story to get the bailout, but the bill said it was for derivatives.
[01:05:07.676 --> 01:05:15.201]  Now in the multi-trillions and growing, just in the United States, not to count worldwide, so it's on record that it is the bankers' derivatives.
[01:05:15.261 --> 01:05:20.224]  But yes, they want to blame it on the American people, so we feel like we have indebtedness to go along with this.
[01:05:20.544 --> 01:05:20.764]  Right.
[01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:25.027]  And AIG has now taken, they've gotten $160 billion already.
[01:05:25.067 --> 01:05:27.068]  They're going to get another $30 billion immediately.
[01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:30.090]  Another $200 billion on top of that, just for AIG.
[01:05:30.612 --> 01:05:32.093]  Now, this is an insurance company.
[01:05:32.673 --> 01:05:44.400]  The interesting thing that came up in the hearings here last week in the Dodd-Shelby Senate Banking Committee, and also the Wyden Committee, the Senate Budget Committee, who got that money?
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:56.286]  It turns out that the money given to AIG was then passed along to European banks, European derivatives merchants, foreign bankers got that money, and of course, Goldman Sachs.
[01:05:56.426 --> 01:05:59.248]  Now, the fact that Goldman Sachs got all that money through AIG
[01:05:59.927 --> 01:06:14.673]  ...opens up Hanky Panky Paulson, Henry Paulson, the former Secretary of the Treasury, under Bush, of course, whose entire wealth was wrapped up in options and other instruments and benefits that he had from Goldman Sachs, which is what he worked for.
[01:06:15.193 --> 01:06:19.315]  Now, the big thing is, the derivatives scandal, I think, is about to explode.
[01:06:19.915 --> 01:06:25.958]  Today in the Washington Post, we have an article by a guy called Schmick, where he says the derivatives problem is a black hole.
[01:06:26.488 --> 01:06:33.891]  And the reason that Geithner can't come forward with any programs is because it's going to take trillions, at least two to three trillion.
[01:06:34.212 --> 01:06:40.895]  And everybody in the Obama administration is afraid to come forward and say, we want two trillion or three trillion.
[01:06:40.915 --> 01:06:45.457]  And by the way, that's what Larry Summers is coming out and saying from the White House.
[01:06:45.477 --> 01:06:47.037]  He's saying we need trillions more.
[01:06:47.418 --> 01:06:48.398]  That's in the news today.
[01:06:48.858 --> 01:06:49.279]  Absolutely.
[01:06:49.299 --> 01:06:50.299]  Well, that's very interesting.
[01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:52.400]  I think that the dam is breaking on this question.
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.601]  See, for the average person, the big issue is,
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.504]  What caused the depression?
[01:06:56.865 --> 01:06:58.128]  Why is there a depression?
[01:06:58.208 --> 01:06:59.411]  Why should there be a depression?
[01:06:59.451 --> 01:07:00.233]  What has changed?
[01:07:00.313 --> 01:07:04.644]  Well, the big difference is we have 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives.
[01:07:05.117 --> 01:07:09.819]  The leverage on that used to be positive, which meant super profits at the apex of the period.
[01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:12.420]  Yeah, they built Ponzi schemes, and now they've imploded.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.681]  And if they can get us to sign on, they'll take over.
[01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:17.843]  But if they don't, it'll come out, they wreck the economy, and they all go to prison.
[01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:24.006]  I had Ron Paul calling for their indictments of these bank heads earlier in the show, so you're absolutely right.
[01:07:24.026 --> 01:07:26.687]  Well, it's going to take something more, and this is what I recommend.
[01:07:26.947 --> 01:07:29.228]  When it comes to derivatives, there's only one policy.
[01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:30.269]  Wipe them out.
[01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:31.169]  Destroy them.
[01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:32.070]  Shred them.
[01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.010]  Delete them.
[01:07:33.511 --> 01:07:34.031]  Burn them.
[01:07:34.712 --> 01:07:35.792]  Make them into wallpaper.
[01:07:35.832 --> 01:07:36.353]  Freeze them.
[01:07:36.373 --> 01:07:37.453]  Freeze them is the best.
[01:07:38.534 --> 01:07:41.356]  Well, I think you've got to get them out of the universe.
[01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:50.942]  And that's the problem with this guy Schmick, is he realizes that derivatives are a black hole, but you can't... And they won't even ban... They won't even... I had a top economist on the last two weeks.
[01:07:51.242 --> 01:07:53.284]  They won't even ban naked short selling.
[01:07:54.468 --> 01:07:57.409]  Well, that may be coming, but anyway, that doesn't stop us.
[01:07:57.829 --> 01:08:07.392]  Our demand has to be, and this is really a matter of economic science, if you want to get out of the Depression, there's only one way to do it, and it's got to be done by government, because nobody else can do it.
[01:08:07.913 --> 01:08:09.133]  Ban derivatives.
[01:08:09.273 --> 01:08:10.874]  Derivatives were illegal.
[01:08:11.194 --> 01:08:21.217]  From 1936 and the New Deal until 1982, when Reagan came in under the influence of Milton Friedman and the rest of these people, derivatives were illegal.
[01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:21.917]  And from 1982 until 1993,
[01:08:24.386 --> 01:08:26.788]  They were a very, very dubious legality.
[01:08:26.848 --> 01:08:31.151]  Nobody was willing to buy them, because there was still this idea that they might be illegal.
[01:08:31.171 --> 01:08:39.317]  But then they used AIG to AAA certify them as an insurance company, and so they labeled literal buckets of crap as gold.
[01:08:39.877 --> 01:08:40.978]  Right, and this was done in 1993.
[01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:44.861]  It's Wendy Graham, the wife of Phil Graham.
[01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.744]  She came in and said, I'm going to make a safe haven for derivatives.
[01:08:49.224 --> 01:08:52.246]  She was backed up by Bob Rubin of Goldman Sachs,
[01:08:53.786 --> 01:08:54.206]  I think so.
[01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:15.318]  With a law that was signed by Clinton, guaranteeing that derivatives were hunky-dory, and that's basically how... But even under the laws they changed, they violated federal laws and international laws tens of thousands of times.
[01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:16.098]  That's on record.
[01:09:16.358 --> 01:09:21.882]  They didn't even follow their own scam rules, and that's why we should have state grand juries move their indictments.
[01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:27.365]  Well, again, you can put all these people in jail, but you've got to get rid of 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives.
[01:09:27.405 --> 01:09:27.805]  The U.S.
[01:09:27.866 --> 01:09:28.526]  part is about
[01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:30.014]  A quadrillion.
[01:09:30.034 --> 01:09:32.256]  Well, Webster, we have to put them in jail.
[01:09:32.336 --> 01:09:41.323]  We have to put them in jail because they're going to expand us into an even bigger Ponzi scheme of world government for and by the bankers if we don't identify them as the crooks!
[01:09:41.824 --> 01:09:44.126]  I'm all for it, but you've got to destroy the derivative.
[01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:49.430]  The re-regulation of markets is what you need, and that means wipe out derivatives.
[01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:55.335]  In other words, not just re-regulate looking forward, but re-regulate looking backward and declare that all of this stuff
[01:09:55.939 --> 01:09:56.960]  Goes into the shredder.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.840]  It gets deleted.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.342]  You press the delete button, and 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives are gone.
[01:10:01.362 --> 01:10:05.824]  Because there's no way, as you and other economists and historians have proven, no way to fix this.
[01:10:05.884 --> 01:10:08.285]  It's a black hole that will consume everything.
[01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:09.486]  Look, we did the banker bailout bill.
[01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:10.186]  We did all this.
[01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:11.327]  And look, it only gets worse.
[01:10:11.367 --> 01:10:12.607]  The stock market's still plunging.
[01:10:13.348 --> 01:10:18.170]  This is why they say, how come Obama doesn't come forward with a solution for the banks?
[01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:22.952]  Well, there is no solution for the banks unless you destroy derivatives.
[01:10:23.092 --> 01:10:24.593]  The whole thing hinges on derivatives.
[01:10:24.966 --> 01:10:27.327]  And this has become more and more obvious to people.
[01:10:27.367 --> 01:10:33.349]  How come Paulson had to revamp the TARP from the first TARP to what it then became?
[01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:36.170]  How come Geithner can't give you any details?
[01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:39.011]  Why are they waiting week after week, day after day?
[01:10:39.131 --> 01:10:42.312]  Citibank is now hovering at about a dollar a share.
[01:10:42.332 --> 01:10:45.453]  There's a little bit of a pop today, but I don't even think it'll last the day.
[01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:47.693]  AIG is 38 cents a share.
[01:10:48.054 --> 01:10:49.294]  This is all derivatives.
[01:10:49.594 --> 01:10:52.195]  There's an article today in McClatchy, very interesting.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:11:09.043]  That if you take the five top banks, Citibank, JP Morgan, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, they have more than enough derivatives losses to wipe out their entire capital base, meaning those are all zombie banks.
[01:11:09.123 --> 01:11:10.044]  Now, it's quite obvious.
[01:11:10.444 --> 01:11:17.025]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, under this crazy Sheila Bear, they have to seize those banks.
[01:11:17.205 --> 01:11:21.726]  Banks are seized in the United States basically every Friday now, but mostly they're little banks.
[01:11:22.193 --> 01:11:22.634]  I think?
[01:11:38.183 --> 01:11:40.445]  Of the entire derivatives bubble on the U.S.
[01:11:40.485 --> 01:11:40.765]  side.
[01:11:40.805 --> 01:11:42.126]  So that would be a way to begin.
[01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:49.973]  And then once we arrest their directors, we can bring them into court and find out the full extent of the Ponzi schemes and then arrest all the rest of them.
[01:11:50.313 --> 01:11:50.854]  Absolutely.
[01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:52.055]  There's no way around it.
[01:11:52.315 --> 01:11:59.721]  We could wake up next week and arrest all these people and the New World Order could end, folks, but the churches are telling you it's impossible, it's up to God, it's going to happen.
[01:12:00.021 --> 01:12:01.082]  That is mind control.
[01:12:01.403 --> 01:12:05.806]  You have to believe we can beat them because we don't have any other hope but to have these people through
[01:12:06.767 --> 01:12:07.667]  New process.
[01:12:08.368 --> 01:12:08.868]  Arrested.
[01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:10.769]  Seized immediately.
[01:12:10.929 --> 01:12:12.249]  Seize the criminals.
[01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:18.932]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:12:19.734 --> 01:12:25.077]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:12:25.598 --> 01:12:31.801]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:33.923]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.464]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:12:36.524 --> 01:12:47.431]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:12:49.725 --> 01:12:50.966]  It's not about left or right.
[01:12:51.386 --> 01:12:52.787]  It's about a one world government.
[01:12:53.247 --> 01:12:59.571]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:09.578]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:09.978 --> 01:13:11.179]  The people strike back.
[01:13:13.601 --> 01:13:17.865]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:30.097]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[01:13:30.518 --> 01:13:35.543]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[01:13:36.123 --> 01:13:37.565]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[01:13:38.098 --> 01:13:44.120]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.521]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:49.801]  Give me a call.

[01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:17.242]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[01:14:17.522 --> 01:14:20.124]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?

[01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:17.275]  Phase one of the insider's plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:15:19.364 --> 01:15:20.085]  We're good to go.
[01:15:48.317 --> 01:15:51.918]  www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.

[01:16:05.483 --> 01:16:05.684]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:16:16.432 --> 01:16:22.455]  I got a message to the government, like every day.
[01:16:22.535 --> 01:16:25.716]  They're telling me about Osama over there.
[01:16:46.221 --> 01:16:47.584]  Listen to the suckers.
[01:16:47.624 --> 01:16:50.430]  God, we've got criminals in control.
[01:16:56.596 --> 01:16:59.317]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[01:16:59.597 --> 01:17:02.158]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[01:17:02.438 --> 01:17:04.519]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[01:17:04.759 --> 01:17:06.420]  Picture me buying this scam.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.320]  I said never.
[01:17:07.681 --> 01:17:10.122]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[01:17:10.342 --> 01:17:12.783]  I stay committed, give up, because I lose commission.
[01:17:12.963 --> 01:17:16.004]  It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control and all about
[01:17:16.504 --> 01:17:18.245]  Let's go back to Webster Tarbley.
[01:17:18.365 --> 01:17:19.765]  Webster, you're going over the economy.
[01:17:19.805 --> 01:17:21.806]  I agree with you about what's happening.
[01:17:21.866 --> 01:17:22.887]  Please continue.
[01:17:22.987 --> 01:17:26.588]  It's good to see Obama's approval rating dropping between 15 and 20 points.
[01:17:40.626 --> 01:17:43.247]  His first couple hundred days trying to ram everything through.
[01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:45.407]  It looks like things are going well.
[01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:46.788]  We're still in a dire situation.
[01:17:47.248 --> 01:17:50.208]  Exposing him, people have got to intensify their operation to expose it?
[01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:56.110]  Yes, and I think it's wonderful that you're taking the lead with the Obama deception.
[01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.131]  It goes right to the heart of Obama.
[01:17:59.711 --> 01:18:04.172]  With Bush, of course, you were dealing with a pretty open reactionary, right?
[01:18:04.192 --> 01:18:08.853]  He would go around and say things like, bring it on, and wanted debtor alive, and so forth.
[01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:15.616]  Obama's a completely different proposition, and as you point out, it's deception, dissembling deception, duping people.
[01:18:15.636 --> 01:18:19.120]  The guy is slippery, slimy, he's evasive.
[01:18:20.021 --> 01:18:25.807]  So the question of deception, I think, is really critical, and it sounds to me like you've assembled a number of voices.
[01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:30.696]  In the Obama deception, which... Well, you haven't seen it yet, but you're the number one voice in the film.
[01:18:31.416 --> 01:18:46.664]  Gerald Celente, George Humphrey, KRS-One, Professor Griff, myself, but it's really Obama showing him, say, one thing, and then a year later doing the opposite, saying he's shutting down camps when he actually is expanding it.
[01:18:47.204 --> 01:18:49.485]  I mean, it's going to be devastating to him.
[01:18:50.706 --> 01:18:54.228]  Today, Obama wants to bust the teachers union.
[01:18:54.268 --> 01:18:56.790]  He just came out with a big thing for merit pay.
[01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:58.371]  It's the equivalent of piecework, right?
[01:18:58.391 --> 01:19:01.893]  If you ever worked in a factory with piecework, you know how difficult that is.
[01:19:02.373 --> 01:19:05.155]  Obama wants to have the equivalent of piecework for teachers.
[01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:08.117]  It's a way to bust the American Federation of Teachers.
[01:19:08.197 --> 01:19:08.858]  Poor dupes.
[01:19:08.998 --> 01:19:09.778]  They supported him.
[01:19:10.218 --> 01:19:11.539]  He's going to stab them in the back.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.302]  Obama says he wants to help people who are going to get foreclosed on.
[01:19:15.342 --> 01:19:17.243]  His answer to that is to increase payments.
[01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:19.672]  To these predators like Mozilla, right?
[01:19:19.692 --> 01:19:21.393]  The Mozilla types that countrywide.
[01:19:21.713 --> 01:19:25.394]  The predatory lenders are going to get the money and maybe somebody might get helped.
[01:19:25.774 --> 01:19:27.375]  But that's not the main idea.
[01:19:27.415 --> 01:19:29.396]  The main idea is to prop up those guys.
[01:19:29.436 --> 01:19:31.877]  So, it's all deception with Obama.
[01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:38.940]  And the main thing, of course, is he's owned by Goldman Sachs, Soros, David Rockefeller, Trilateral Commission.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:46.343]  The foreign policy is a more sophisticated version of imperialism that depends on playing other countries.
[01:19:47.111 --> 01:19:47.811]  One against the other.
[01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:50.472]  Right now they're trying to play Russia against Iran.
[01:19:50.492 --> 01:19:53.873]  They're trying to get Russia to become the leading edge of a U.S.
[01:19:55.173 --> 01:20:01.035]  assault on Iran, really, with the idea that what's going to come out of that is conflict between Iran and Russia, with the U.S.
[01:20:01.055 --> 01:20:01.635]  holding back.
[01:20:01.815 --> 01:20:13.998]  Well, expanding on that, George Soros at the Davis Forum three weeks ago, you may have seen the video, admits they're lowering oil prices as a weapon against Russia, Venezuela, the Middle East, to accelerate the World Depression.
[01:20:15.256 --> 01:20:17.957]  Yes, I'm sure that he would say that.
[01:20:17.977 --> 01:20:22.820]  I think the collapse of oil prices has got a number of things going on.
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.081]  Some of that is hedge funds approaching bankruptcy.
[01:20:25.401 --> 01:20:29.203]  They go into a liquidation mode and dump their speculative positions.
[01:20:29.263 --> 01:20:32.925]  The other thing, of course, is that demand is shrinking as the Depression hits.
[01:20:32.985 --> 01:20:36.706]  But certainly, they're trying to turn that against Russia.
[01:20:36.747 --> 01:20:38.227]  So that goes on.
[01:20:38.507 --> 01:20:39.448]  Also with Sudan.
[01:20:39.508 --> 01:20:41.749]  Look, the biggest country in Africa.
[01:20:42.256 --> 01:20:46.098]  Right now, you've got this awful woman, Susan Rice, at the United Nations.
[01:20:47.258 --> 01:20:48.319]  They're moving U.S.
[01:20:48.359 --> 01:20:51.400]  forces into Africa right now, and they've got a black face to do it.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.822]  Yeah, and Sudan is this huge country.
[01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:59.084]  I've actually been there, and you fly from northern Sudan to southern Sudan.
[01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.924]  You're going for hours and hours and hours.
[01:21:01.004 --> 01:21:08.768]  It's huge, and it's the key to Africa in many ways, and they're sending China about 6, 7, 8 percent of Chinese oil.
[01:21:09.412 --> 01:21:12.915]  And the goal now is to, they've declared the president an outlaw, right?
[01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:16.078]  Bashir, they want to make him into a criminal.
[01:21:16.218 --> 01:21:20.941]  Yeah, we now have the UN, and they made it a liberal cost to the lab to do this, we're not saying the guy's perfect.
[01:21:21.222 --> 01:21:27.126]  The point is, they've made, he's the first sitting president that the UN has indicted.
[01:21:28.007 --> 01:21:36.034]  And that they have a proposal for a no-fly zone over Sudan, which would simply mean that the US Air Force would then try to shoot down
[01:21:36.733 --> 01:21:38.214]  All flights over Sudan.
[01:21:38.254 --> 01:21:39.675]  Now, that's a wonderful thing.
[01:21:39.715 --> 01:21:42.297]  Let's bring war to another continent.
[01:21:42.337 --> 01:21:45.639]  Let's have Africa in flames in addition to the Middle East in flames.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.262]  And the vector point is Sudan for the NORTHCOM invasion.
[01:21:49.342 --> 01:21:49.602]  U.S.
[01:21:49.622 --> 01:21:54.866]  forces massing all over the continent of Africa with smiling Obama leading the way.
[01:21:56.007 --> 01:21:56.967]  Stay there, Webster Tarble.
[01:21:56.987 --> 01:22:01.811]  We'll come back and continue with the real agenda and the Obama deception at InfoWars.com.
[01:22:03.072 --> 01:22:03.992]  We're on the march.
[01:22:04.473 --> 01:22:05.974]  The empire's on the run.
[01:22:07.001 --> 01:22:09.673]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:18.866]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:19.387 --> 01:23:26.353]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:33.145]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:33.525 --> 01:23:35.367]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:35.507 --> 01:23:37.909]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:23:38.009 --> 01:23:48.938]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:49.578 --> 01:23:50.859]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:52.621]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:53.098 --> 01:23:59.446]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:09.438]  The Obama Deception.
[01:24:09.858 --> 01:24:11.040]  The people strike back.
[01:24:12.973 --> 01:24:16.617]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:22.303]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:24:22.423 --> 01:24:26.467]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:24:26.767 --> 01:24:29.050]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:35.116]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:24:35.216 --> 01:24:35.696]  I don't know.

[01:25:53.501 --> 01:25:55.502]  It is too vital to wait at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:59.119 --> 01:26:01.060]  I was out of the studio during the break.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:05.663]  John, do we have our next guest on from We Are Change Ireland, Keith Bryan?
[01:26:07.744 --> 01:26:08.825]  We're going to go to him in a moment.
[01:26:13.447 --> 01:26:14.288]  Webster Tarpley.
[01:26:18.379 --> 01:26:21.684]  Again, I want to get back to how to defeat these people.
[01:26:21.985 --> 01:26:25.591]  They are now announcing what they had currently and previously said they were going to do.
[01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:27.354]  Use the Obamanoids.
[01:26:27.594 --> 01:26:30.719]  I have the quotes here in a story Kurt Nemo did out of Mainstream News.
[01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:45.594]  Canvass in and find out, the exact quote is chilling, who supports Obama and who doesn't on a door-by-door basis and pressure people, exactly what you said with these multi-million man goon force.
[01:26:45.614 --> 01:26:53.477]  Now he's openly admitting, and the Army's admitting, a million person civilian military force that after the military takes over a country including the U.S., they're the bureaucracy.
[01:26:53.497 --> 01:26:57.339]  I mean, it's all happening, so how do we defeat this?
[01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:05.615]  Well, as I write in my latest book, which is Surviving the Cataclysm, just published by Progressive Press last week, actually.
[01:27:05.655 --> 01:27:08.176]  First copies of Surviving the Cataclysm now going out.
[01:27:08.676 --> 01:27:10.217]  The main thing is political organizing.
[01:27:10.898 --> 01:27:16.180]  The thing with Obama is an illusion, and it's an illusion which is very fragile.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.883]  And I think you can see already the signs that Obama's beginning to get bogged down.
[01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:25.645]  As long as he was running for office, he could make promises 360 degrees.
[01:27:27.202 --> 01:27:29.304]  He promised everything and the opposite of everything.
[01:27:29.404 --> 01:27:35.268]  Once you're in office, you've got to come down and make certain decisions, even though those are hidden.
[01:27:35.768 --> 01:27:45.515]  There's a tremendous propaganda effort to hide the fact that the essence of Obama is $10 trillion to the banks, with an unlimited blank check.
[01:27:45.895 --> 01:27:52.840]  If you looked at his State of the Union address, he basically said, we will do anything for the banks.
[01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:55.222]  He doesn't say we will do anything for the homeless.
[01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:58.210]  Or for the auto industry, or for anybody else.
[01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:59.111]  Only the banks.
[01:27:59.971 --> 01:28:05.734]  The more that this can be understood, I think the quicker the illusion of Obama will collapse.
[01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:08.016]  In other words, he can crater very easily.
[01:28:08.796 --> 01:28:10.497]  Because it's all based on hysteria.
[01:28:10.537 --> 01:28:20.102]  You can already see that in the financial community, there are some people who now think more that he's an incompetent, that he's not an effective crisis manager.
[01:28:20.598 --> 01:28:29.866]  You have among the swooning, drooling liberals at the New York Times, people like Maureen Dowd, they're beginning to think that he's maybe not the messiah that they thought.
[01:28:29.906 --> 01:28:31.507]  He might even be a false messiah.
[01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:37.753]  Well, they're already preparing to blame everything on him when he's just a puppet minion.
[01:28:38.293 --> 01:28:39.314]  Here's the quote here.
[01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:46.460]  It says his new organization, Organizing for America, will be going door-to-door to map out and identify support.
[01:28:47.161 --> 01:28:47.982]  To map out.
[01:28:49.284 --> 01:28:54.530]  I mean, his goons are hitting the street and they're trying to sell his financial system and what he's pushing.
[01:28:55.651 --> 01:28:57.032]  Well, don't open the door, right?
[01:28:57.072 --> 01:28:58.594]  Don't let them get their hands on your door.
[01:28:58.654 --> 01:28:59.034]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:59.174 --> 01:29:01.517]  Open the door and give them an Obama deception.
[01:29:01.537 --> 01:29:03.459]  Yes, if you have one.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:04.320]  Sure.
[01:29:04.781 --> 01:29:05.241]  That's great.
[01:29:05.281 --> 01:29:06.161]  Counter-organize them.
[01:29:06.201 --> 01:29:06.721]  That's better.
[01:29:07.422 --> 01:29:08.162]  Counter-organize them.
[01:29:08.222 --> 01:29:10.382]  Shouldn't we go to Obama meetings?
[01:29:10.462 --> 01:29:14.643]  I mean, we have usaservice.org with a map of every meeting in every town and city.
[01:29:14.863 --> 01:29:18.204]  Shouldn't we go there and lovingly explain to them, you think you're repudiating Bush?
[01:29:18.524 --> 01:29:19.784]  This is Bush on steroids?
[01:29:20.885 --> 01:29:21.785]  I suppose you can.
[01:29:21.845 --> 01:29:25.146]  I also, I would urge people to look at the big picture, right?
[01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:30.827]  You can always call into these big sort of Wall Street controlled talk radios.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.582]  You can have a tremendous impact.
[01:29:33.642 --> 01:29:35.544]  Again, I'd recommend political organizing.
[01:29:35.584 --> 01:29:38.987]  A lot of people are looking at apocalyptic scenarios, right?
[01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:41.090]  That it's going to come to some kind of civil strife.
[01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:42.451]  I don't think we're there yet.
[01:29:42.491 --> 01:29:44.413]  I think it's time to try politics.
[01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:47.296]  Well, I see the globalists are hyping that.
[01:29:48.136 --> 01:29:50.939]  Well, you've got to have your own program to get out of the Depression.
[01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:51.880]  I have one, right?
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.101]  Wipe out derivatives.
[01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:54.222]  Seize the Fed.
[01:29:54.362 --> 01:29:55.824]  Issue zero credit production.
[01:29:56.434 --> 01:29:57.154]  We're good to go.
[01:30:19.983 --> 01:30:22.865]  Seize the central bank, start making that a national bank.
[01:30:22.885 --> 01:30:25.547]  Okay, let's stop there, let's stop there, let's stop there.
[01:30:25.567 --> 01:30:28.348]  They're already doing a counterfeit of what you just said.
[01:30:28.388 --> 01:30:38.415]  They're claiming the Federal Reserve is federal, not private, and saying they are going to nationalize the banks, when in truth it is the private bankrupt banks coming in to take over with government power.
[01:30:38.735 --> 01:30:44.999]  So how do you educate folks that we're not seeing a nationalization right now, we're seeing a privatized looting taking place?
[01:30:45.578 --> 01:30:46.979]  Around this issue of derivatives.
[01:30:47.179 --> 01:30:52.261]  In other words, the derivatives are the heart of the five big money center banks that we mentioned before.
[01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:58.703]  If you wipe out derivatives, you've essentially wiped out those five banks, because they are really zombie banks, right?
[01:30:59.023 --> 01:31:00.404]  They've always been zombie banks.
[01:31:00.904 --> 01:31:02.845]  They don't lend for plant and equipment.
[01:31:02.945 --> 01:31:09.188]  When GM, Ford, and Chrysler were about to go bankrupt last December, the zombie banks did not come forward.
[01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:12.029]  We just had Circuit City collapse.
[01:31:12.449 --> 01:31:13.469]  35,000 jobs.
[01:31:13.489 --> 01:31:13.929]  600 stores.
[01:31:14.210 --> 01:31:15.330]  Where were the zombie banks?
[01:31:15.714 --> 01:31:17.456]  The zombie banks don't lend.
[01:31:17.756 --> 01:31:25.025]  They're getting money from the TARP, they're getting money on the Federal Reserve bailout, which is ten times bigger, and they're not lending.
[01:31:25.125 --> 01:31:27.048]  So these banks have got to be wiped out.
[01:31:27.508 --> 01:31:33.956]  The Federal Reserve has got to be seized, nationalized, and then you begin issuing your zero percent credit
[01:31:34.434 --> 01:31:35.754]  For production only.
[01:31:35.914 --> 01:31:37.375]  Not for financial services.
[01:31:37.775 --> 01:31:38.875]  Not for speculation.
[01:31:38.995 --> 01:31:42.196]  A lot of economists say that it shouldn't be a classical tariff either.
[01:31:42.236 --> 01:31:45.817]  It should just be a tax incentive when industry moves to the United States.
[01:31:46.717 --> 01:31:49.438]  Well, I've talked about this in the following terms.
[01:31:49.518 --> 01:31:54.259]  If you've got Count Dracula on the victim, you've got to rip Count Dracula off the victim.
[01:31:54.339 --> 01:31:55.479]  Put a stake through his heart.
[01:31:55.819 --> 01:31:58.160]  But now you've got a victim who's basically about dead.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.620]  You've got to administer a transfusion.
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.861]  That's your federal zero percent credit.
[01:32:03.425 --> 01:32:05.347]  Plus oxygen and a defibrillator.
[01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:09.550]  And that's your program of large-scale infrastructure.
[01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:14.795]  100 nuclear reactors, coast-to-coast maglev railways, commuter rail, all this.
[01:32:15.235 --> 01:32:16.796]  And your three science drivers.
[01:32:16.836 --> 01:32:20.439]  Your space program, your biomedical, and your high-energy physics.
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:22.041]  And that starts both sides.
[01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:22.501]  It's true.
[01:32:22.741 --> 01:32:24.463]  It's not enough just to offer lending.
[01:32:24.723 --> 01:32:28.566]  You've got to generate demand for borrowing, because you're in a panic.
[01:32:29.025 --> 01:32:36.721]  You're inhabiting the negative curvature of the inside of a collapsed... But Webster, they've already brought us... I'm going to get our next guest briefly here.
[01:32:37.102 --> 01:32:38.966]  Have him back on in the next few days for a more detailed report.
[01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:39.747]  This is very important.
[01:32:41.266 --> 01:32:53.395]  That we're already so deep into it, some are saying it could be irrevocable, and so after our next guest leaves us, I want to briefly talk about if they allow total implosion, how would you change your plan after that point with your perspective?
[01:32:53.435 --> 01:33:03.122]  But Webster, we know the British have been caught over and over again, more than 75% of the terror attacks in Northern Ireland, Ireland and England, being staged by British Special Air Services, MI5 and MI6.
[01:33:03.743 --> 01:33:06.665]  They're now kicking this off again, and I said yesterday, I said,
[01:33:08.359 --> 01:33:15.405]  In fact, at the start of the show, before I'd seen the latest article, I said, will there be a drill around these two British soldiers being killed?
[01:33:15.705 --> 01:33:17.086]  A drill of the exact same thing happening.
[01:33:17.547 --> 01:33:23.152]  We already know that the security services military stood down even as they saw them shooting and didn't fire back.
[01:33:23.572 --> 01:33:24.913]  That is now mainstream news.
[01:33:25.273 --> 01:33:26.655]  This is the Belfast Telegraph.
[01:33:26.675 --> 01:33:28.756]  Soldiers shot dead in Northern Ireland terror attack.
[01:33:29.457 --> 01:33:31.679]  The attack happened just 36 hours from Northern Ireland.
[01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:46.235]  Chief Constable Sir Hugh Ord confirmed that undercover soldiers had been called in to carry out surveillance operations on dissidents and amid warnings that the threat against his officers and military personnel was at its highest for almost a decade that they were doing drills.
[01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:47.676]  Here's another one.
[01:33:48.076 --> 01:33:50.297]  This is out of the Metro.co.uk.
[01:33:50.397 --> 01:33:52.079]  I guess this is the one in the Metro.
[01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:18.636]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be back on.
[01:34:18.656 --> 01:34:19.637]  I think last time round
[01:34:41.451 --> 01:34:48.737]  We were all upbeat about our victory against the European Constitution, known as the Lisbon Treaty, but this time around, it seems like things are a little different.
[01:34:48.857 --> 01:34:51.819]  So, it's great to be on, and hello to Webster Tarpley, too.
[01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:52.480]  Hi there!
[01:34:53.561 --> 01:34:55.882]  Okay, you're there in Ireland.
[01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:58.084]  Give us the breakdown on what's happening.
[01:34:59.305 --> 01:35:01.927]  Well, Alex, I think there's a lot of ambiguity going on.
[01:35:02.487 --> 01:35:06.711]  People aren't quite sure what happened or what is meant to happen out of this.
[01:35:07.609 --> 01:35:11.330]  Um, as we know that there were six people shot there on Saturday night.
[01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:16.032]  Two of them were pronounced dead and they were two soldiers of, uh, British Army.
[01:35:16.232 --> 01:35:22.614]  There was two other soldiers hit with bullets and there was two other civilians which were just delivering pizzas to, uh, the barracks.
[01:35:23.936 --> 01:35:31.698]  I actually did some investigation earlier, the way you were saying, when I was speaking to Rob, and I came across some interesting things.
[01:35:32.238 --> 01:35:46.182]  The actual people who provide security on these bases is called NISGS, which is the Northern Ireland Security Guard Services, and they are normally armed with weapons, and they also patrol their bases.
[01:35:46.502 --> 01:35:51.563]  It was confirmed from an army source in the actual Australian news
[01:35:52.353 --> 01:35:52.613]  That's
[01:36:13.592 --> 01:36:17.274]  Same thing happened last week in Pakistan with the attack on the cricket team.
[01:36:17.334 --> 01:36:20.256]  Perfect propaganda to outrage cricket fans.
[01:36:20.296 --> 01:36:21.476]  Tens of millions worldwide.
[01:36:21.516 --> 01:36:23.337]  It's almost as big as soccer in many areas.
[01:36:23.697 --> 01:36:24.598]  Don't know in the U.S.
[01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:26.759]  And the same thing there.
[01:36:26.819 --> 01:36:31.682]  Mainstream news is saying was it an inside job because the government
[01:36:32.877 --> 01:36:35.420]  There's police right there, and the shooters shoot.
[01:36:35.821 --> 01:36:37.803]  Calmly take your time, walk right by the police.
[01:36:38.383 --> 01:36:39.044]  Nothing's done.
[01:36:39.064 --> 01:36:40.085]  This stinks to high heaven.
[01:36:40.466 --> 01:36:42.328]  Webster, I mean, it's the same M.O.
[01:36:42.428 --> 01:36:42.968]  every time.
[01:36:43.369 --> 01:36:49.976]  Why does the establishment, we're not sure with these new cases, others have been confirmed, but why do they like to stage these shootings?
[01:36:50.056 --> 01:36:51.398]  As a pretext to bring in more troops?
[01:36:52.895 --> 01:37:02.963]  Well, Britain, under the Labour government of Tony Blair and now Gordon Brown, Britain has gone much further down the road to a police state than the U.S.
[01:37:03.143 --> 01:37:03.343]  even.
[01:37:04.404 --> 01:37:10.108]  Part of it is that the parties are controlled top-down by the parliamentary whip system.
[01:37:10.589 --> 01:37:20.076]  The other thing is that you haven't had mass movements, you haven't had the kind of thing that you've seen in the U.S., and you don't have independent communications by and large, right?
[01:37:20.096 --> 01:37:21.837]  There's a large amount of television
[01:37:22.347 --> 01:37:25.489]  And radio broadcasting is controlled by the BBC.
[01:37:25.789 --> 01:37:29.872]  There is some commercial opposition, you know, competition to that.
[01:37:30.372 --> 01:37:35.375]  But it doesn't amount to the kind of thing that you have in the US, of all ideological types.
[01:37:35.435 --> 01:37:49.104]  So I would say Gordon Brown, you know, having started with this thing about bank bailouts, bank nationalizations, hundreds of billions and trillions of pounds now committed to the derivatives bailout and wanting to be the leader of this, right?
[01:37:49.124 --> 01:37:50.285]  Because that's what he is right now.
[01:37:50.345 --> 01:37:51.626]  Gordon Brown is the world leader
[01:37:52.055 --> 01:37:54.554]  In the bailout brigade, I think they're...
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:38:00.344]  They're tightening the screws and they're looking for pretexts for more and more police state controls inside.
[01:38:00.444 --> 01:38:00.924]  That's right.
[01:38:01.004 --> 01:38:08.970]  Peaceably, the people of Ireland are moving to kick British forces out and get true sovereignty and this violence is the best friend of the establishment.
[01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:17.095]  It's turned out most IRA was commanded by British intelligence and they would threaten their underlings with death if they wouldn't go out and commit shootings and bombings.
[01:38:17.696 --> 01:38:20.718]  Going back to We Are Change Ireland, Keith, Brian.
[01:38:21.138 --> 01:38:23.400]  Keith, continue with other intel you've got from Ireland.
[01:38:24.588 --> 01:38:26.933]  Well, basically, I was just scouring the newspapers.
[01:38:27.033 --> 01:38:32.625]  I was just, you know, randomly Googling what the M.O.s would be, and that's how I came across this stand-down, or these...
[01:38:33.175 --> 01:38:34.075]  I don't think so.
[01:39:00.379 --> 01:39:09.864]  One gentleman called Patrick Mercer, he's a former Infantry Regiment Commanding Officer and he is now Chairman of the Commons Counterterrorism Subcommittee.
[01:39:10.424 --> 01:39:21.929]  And he went on to say, we have to question the efficacy of the Guard Force if it is not armed guards stood by as British soldiers are shot at Northern Ireland Base prepared to fire back on the enemy.
[01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:27.572]  And let's expand on that, they then came over and stood over them and raked them with fire again.
[01:39:29.013 --> 01:39:35.759]  Yeah, well, and this guy goes on to say, well, how are we meant to be a deterrent in the future if the terrorists know that we're not going to be shot at?
[01:39:36.339 --> 01:39:45.727]  And when you look at it, I mean, I'm sure that the people who were attacking the base knew that they were going to receive some sort of fireback or some sort of retaliation, but there was none.
[01:39:46.288 --> 01:39:57.357]  Now, why would, that's a key point, why would they waddle up after shooting them in the distance and then stand over them and shoot them again, right up at the gate of the base, not thinking they'd be fired upon, knowing there was armed forces in there?
[01:39:58.584 --> 01:40:02.488]  Yeah, not just that, they also were waiting there, Alex.
[01:40:02.988 --> 01:40:14.239]  So that, I mean, I'm actually reading army reports here, and I don't know who the person is, it's coming from Australian and various other news sources, but they're scrutinizing the situation.
[01:40:14.259 --> 01:40:17.822]  They're saying, well, why was there no armed guards coming outside the base to collect the pizzas?
[01:40:18.122 --> 01:40:23.227]  That's normal protocol for people with weapons to come outside in case there was an actual attack.
[01:40:23.886 --> 01:40:24.186]  I think so.
[01:40:43.547 --> 01:40:49.988]  ammunition being used against these six individuals which, thank God, no more than two are killed.
[01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:53.929]  Yeah, that's two and a third banana clips sprayed into them.
[01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:56.170]  Just amazing.
[01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:59.931]  Well, is there a We Are Change website you want to plug?
[01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:04.251]  I know you guys put out a film as well and have really been making the news over there confronting politicians.
[01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:06.132]  Any sites that you want to plug?
[01:41:06.972 --> 01:41:08.912]  Yeah, there's several sites now, Alex.
[01:41:08.972 --> 01:41:10.613]  There's WiseUpJournal.com,
[01:41:11.897 --> 01:41:12.077]  I don't
[01:41:28.571 --> 01:41:36.938]  It's quite interesting what's going on recently and it's reminiscent to what we once knew in the past and it's kind of being brought into the present now.
[01:41:37.939 --> 01:41:47.166]  I feel, Alex, if this goes on, basically there will be British troops back on the streets up there because they're not going to stand by while British soldiers are being fired upon.
[01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:50.729]  And now they've killed a police officer last night too.
[01:41:52.003 --> 01:41:58.906]  Yeah, basically what happened there was somebody threw a stone or a brick through some person's window.
[01:41:59.426 --> 01:42:11.791]  Maybe that was a tactic to draw the police in, but one police officer who has 22 years of experience in the police force up there, who must have seen quite a lot, he arrived up on the scene and
[01:42:12.478 --> 01:42:22.380]  Um, basically when the car came to a standstill, somebody come up from the rear window and just unloaded into the car and I think, uh, I think he was shot in the head and, uh, he died instantly.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.621]  Well, it's on record the British do most of this.
[01:42:24.641 --> 01:42:25.641]  They've been caught red-handed.
[01:42:25.981 --> 01:42:28.082]  We'll talk to you in the next few days as this develops.
[01:42:28.122 --> 01:42:29.382]  Thanks for your great information.
[01:42:29.602 --> 01:42:30.602]  And we are Change Ireland.
[01:42:31.502 --> 01:42:33.323]  Alex, take care of yourself and bye for Webster.
[01:42:34.003 --> 01:42:34.843]  Alright, take care.
[01:42:34.863 --> 01:42:42.666]  We're going to come back in a final five minute segment and talk about if the depression continues to unfold, if we're not able to turn them around, what do we do then?
[01:42:42.686 --> 01:42:53.650]  I know you're saying work to change it now, but how would we extricate ourselves from the crisis if it's allowed to continue to deteriorate over the next six months to a year, which is clear they're not going to change course.
[01:42:54.150 --> 01:42:59.312]  We're going to force them later too, but you can see the energy of the people versus the establishment and you can see the trajectory.
[01:42:59.952 --> 01:43:05.553]  And it's clear it's going to take more time to stop this juggernaut of destruction, financial destruction, from rolling forward.
[01:43:05.593 --> 01:43:06.753]  Also, will they hit Iran?
[01:43:06.773 --> 01:43:07.574]  They're beating the war drums.
[01:43:07.914 --> 01:43:09.954]  For that, yet again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:43:09.994 --> 01:43:12.095]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:43:12.855 --> 01:43:14.355]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:43:14.535 --> 01:43:15.995]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:18.496]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:43:18.956 --> 01:43:23.677]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:43:24.105 --> 01:43:26.927]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:43:27.287 --> 01:43:43.178]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:43:43.739 --> 01:43:45.740]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.061]  I use one every day.
[01:43:47.481 --> 01:43:49.943]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:43:50.303 --> 01:43:53.326]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:19.617 --> 01:44:24.961]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:25.502 --> 01:44:31.686]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:31.986 --> 01:44:33.808]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:33.968 --> 01:44:36.350]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:47.318]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:49.602 --> 01:44:50.863]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:51.283 --> 01:44:52.684]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:53.124 --> 01:44:59.467]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:40.081]  Those are also available at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:41.542 --> 01:46:47.985]  Webster, as we launch the film coming up in the next few days, I want to have you back on next week to break it all down after you've had a chance to see it.
[01:46:48.285 --> 01:46:51.907]  We'll give you a prisonplanet.tv membership so you don't have to wait to have the DVD shipped to you.
[01:46:52.567 --> 01:46:55.828]  And you can go up there and watch it in super high quality and give me your review of it.
[01:46:55.848 --> 01:46:57.689]  I think you're going to be extremely pleased with it.
[01:46:57.709 --> 01:47:02.551]  We just get better and better at making these films and Obama's given us plenty of material to make it.
[01:47:02.591 --> 01:47:02.952]  We've got a
[01:47:03.832 --> 01:47:06.434]  Well, you don't get out of the depression unless you make these changes.
[01:47:06.454 --> 01:47:08.475]  There is no automatic exit from the depression.
[01:47:08.495 --> 01:47:10.276]  There is no business cycle.
[01:47:32.719 --> 01:47:38.202]  It's going to lift you out of the depression, and I'm also afraid there is no free market solution to the depression.
[01:47:38.242 --> 01:47:44.385]  If you call for the free market under these circumstances, basically making everything much worse.
[01:47:45.425 --> 01:47:46.766]  Think of food stamps.
[01:47:46.786 --> 01:47:54.630]  There are 3 million people in Texas who are living thanks to food stamps, and if you say free market, take that away, well, that's going to be the end of a lot of them.
[01:47:54.710 --> 01:47:58.452]  So I think that the question is, how long will it take for people
[01:47:58.993 --> 01:48:05.095]  To throw off the chains of ideology and all the illusions and all the clap-clap of the past 40 years.
[01:48:05.915 --> 01:48:09.396]  One thing is, there's a sign of a mass movement against derivatives.
[01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:11.336]  And that is the produce the note.
[01:48:11.817 --> 01:48:15.257]  It's a mass movement against derivatives and against foreclosures.
[01:48:15.337 --> 01:48:17.618]  It's people who are facing foreclosure.
[01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:20.799]  They're going to be thrown out on the street and they say, wait a minute.
[01:48:21.266 --> 01:48:25.008]  You've got to produce the piece of paper that I signed.
[01:48:25.808 --> 01:48:26.509]  Produce the note.
[01:48:26.769 --> 01:48:27.809]  Show me the piece of paper.
[01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:33.252]  And they'll say, oh no, that's been securitized and sent to London, or Zurich, or Tokyo.
[01:48:33.272 --> 01:48:34.873]  We don't have that piece of paper anymore.
[01:48:34.953 --> 01:48:38.695]  Well, then you can't foreclose.
[01:48:38.755 --> 01:48:40.616]  And any kind of an honest local judge
[01:48:41.315 --> 01:48:52.784]  Uh, who's got to get re-elected will say, all right, if you don't produce the notes, then the person cannot... People have already been using that for five years to get out of many of these phony mortgages because it all is fraud.
[01:48:52.844 --> 01:48:56.046]  It was sold and turned in to derivatives.
[01:48:56.207 --> 01:48:57.908]  And I, um, I agree with you, Webster.
[01:48:57.928 --> 01:48:59.449]  We're between a rock and a hard place here.
[01:48:59.509 --> 01:49:03.172]  And I don't think all the school of the depression, right?
[01:49:03.312 --> 01:49:05.534]  The depression is a very cruel kind of, uh,
[01:49:06.152 --> 01:49:11.834]  Educational process, but it is a school of life, and it teaches, I think, fundamentally class consciousness.
[01:49:11.894 --> 01:49:15.155]  That bankers are one thing, and you are something else.
[01:49:15.655 --> 01:49:33.620]  And any approach to the Depression that doesn't say there are, you know, 500,000 bankers and financier oligarchs in this country who have been the beneficiaries of the system, and their interests have got to be sacrificed because they're antithetical to the survival of humanity as a whole.
[01:49:34.744 --> 01:49:46.251]  We can't have foreclosures, we can't have derivatives, there are all kinds of things to do to stop speculation, but then you've got to get the thing going in terms of federal lending, 0% federal lending for production.
[01:49:46.787 --> 01:49:50.468]  And you've got to have your infrastructure programs and your science drivers.
[01:49:50.488 --> 01:49:56.170]  The problem is, in closing, the Feds are owned by offshore banks, so any money would always be gobbled by them.
[01:49:56.530 --> 01:49:58.310]  Webster, we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[01:49:58.370 --> 01:50:01.211]  Capital controls, capital controls and exchange controls.
[01:50:01.571 --> 01:50:02.191]  We're out of time.
[01:50:02.371 --> 01:50:04.212]  Webster, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:50:04.232 --> 01:50:05.892]  Congratulations on the new film, Alex.
[01:50:06.952 --> 01:50:07.512]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:07.753 --> 01:50:08.533]  You'll see it soon.
[01:50:08.553 --> 01:50:10.433]  Alright, Webster Tarpley's leaving us.
[01:50:11.994 --> 01:50:12.754]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:50:14.184 --> 01:50:17.053]  If I'm able to in the future, I'll tell you the type of dirty tricks that are going on.
[01:50:17.274 --> 01:50:21.226]  I can't get into that right now on air, but know this, the Obama deception will go out.
[01:50:22.555 --> 01:50:32.982]  God's will come hell or high water, as they say, and it could be out today, it could be out tomorrow, or if I'm able, I may wait till Sunday, because I really want to put out some more of the trailers and build the excitement, because that's what will have a bigger effect.
[01:50:33.902 --> 01:50:39.826]  Just know this, we are fighting, and we need your prayers here, ladies and gentlemen, because we are going toe-to-toe up against the New World Order.
[01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:46.250]  I had Ron Paul on, a bunch of other powerful guests today, the rebroadcast on the audio stream starts in 70 seconds.
[01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:47.310]  One place,
[01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:52.357]  Infowars.com and on the MNFM dial.
[01:50:52.397 --> 01:50:53.178]  God bless you all.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:56.623]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:51:02.605 --> 01:51:04.167]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:04.287 --> 01:51:08.914]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:09.034 --> 01:51:11.798]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:14.862]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:15.042 --> 01:51:19.769]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:19.989 --> 01:51:20.890]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:21.110 --> 01:51:24.071]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:24.352 --> 01:51:31.256]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
