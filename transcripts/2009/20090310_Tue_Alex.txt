[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:00.989]  So on.
[00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.609]  Have you checked the results?
[00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.970]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.311]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.511]  Have you checked their results?
[00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.572]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:16.072]  Did you check the ingredients and you check for caffeine?
[00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:17.312]  Yeah!
[00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.153]  Life Change Tea's the real deal.
[00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:24.233]  Not a new yippee-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.674]  And it will clean your body.
[00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:26.674]  Our middle name is Results.
[00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:30.477]  You can pay more and you can have a celebrity smile, or you can get results.
[00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:31.037]  Your call.
[00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.279]  Or should I say, make the call.
[00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.779]  Get the T at 928-308-0408.
[00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:34.040]  That's 928-308-0408.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.501]  Or you can order online at GetTheT.com.
[00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.201]  That's GetTheT.com.
[00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:37.002]  Order now for real results.
[00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:37.983]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:09.760]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.341]  You want answers?
[00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.903]  Well, so does he.
[00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:17.107]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:21.151]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:40.990]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.531]  It is the 10th day of March 2009.
[00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:52.920]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.465]  Congressman Ron Paul joining us from the Hill is scheduled to be on in the next hour.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.163]  But when we do do interviews with him from the Hill, it is notoriously fluid.
[00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:21.492]  He always ends up making it, but it might be at 11.30, it might be at 1.30 that he joins us, because when they're voting and committee hearings are going on, his first duty is to what's happening in Congress.
[00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:27.155]  And I have a host of important questions for Congressman Ron Paul on the economy and a lot more coming up.
[00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:36.223]  We also have Keith Bryan joining us from Ireland.
[00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.044]  We Are Change.
[00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:51.390]  I want to get their take on the two members of the British military that were shot dead two nights ago and then a policeman shot dead by the quote real IRA and the provisional IRA, two supposed splinter groups.
[00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.153]  Over 75% of the shootings and terrorist bombings in Northern Ireland, Ireland and in England have been confirmed even in mainstream news
[00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:00.895]  No, I'm not.
[00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:18.609]  command the IRA and command the Splinter IRA groups.
[00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.932]  They're not just infiltrating them, they command them.
[00:03:21.932 --> 00:03:28.077]  And that they order their subordinates, who many times discover they're working for British Intelligence, to carry it out.
[00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:35.523]  And when they don't, British Intelligence, working as the IRA, murders them.
[00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:39.367]  And the people of Ireland are desperately trying to get their sovereignty back.
[00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.746]  And they're trying to do it peacefully and having success.
[00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:48.390]  They've also successfully thrown off European Union membership.
[00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.134]  And so, I would say a 90 plus percent chance.
[00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.813]  Or more, that this is British intelligence carrying out these operations.
[00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:06.181]  But we will check in with the Emerald Isle and with the Irish coming up at the end of the show today.
[00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:11.687]  We also have Webster Tarpley joining us, wrote an article called Obamaville's.
[00:04:11.687 --> 00:04:14.570]  There's more and more tent cities pop up around the country.
[00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:31.230]  We have Mr. Kane joining us who runs TruthAM.com, a great way to put up little AM transmitters that go out three miles when you put them upright on top of your house, little antenna.
[00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:38.293]  And then you put up signs for three miles and can reach in some areas tens of thousands of people, in rural areas hundreds.
[00:04:39.227 --> 00:04:40.828]  Very, very exciting.
[00:04:40.828 --> 00:04:44.471]  FCC, completely legal and lawful.
[00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:49.915]  This is the most powerful, lawful unit out there, but they know how to boost it with the antenna.
[00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.938]  Then you just plug it into the internet, stream this show, or whatever you like, or do your own show.
[00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.161]  Or both.
[00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:57.842]  So that is coming up.
[00:04:57.842 --> 00:05:01.664]  We'll also talk to the fella from CheckpointUSA.com.
[00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:07.326]  They're now setting up a hundred plus miles into the country border checkpoints, but they wave the illegal aliens through.
[00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:10.208]  They use it as an excuse to search citizens' cars.
[00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:15.330]  They say it's a Constitution-free zone for a hundred plus miles on the northern and southern border.
[00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.674]  More than two-thirds of our population lives on the coastal borders or on the contiguous borders with Canada and Mexico.
[00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:33.355]  And so this is being used to harass citizens, just like the stimulus bill has a waiver so illegal aliens can be hired to get the money.
[00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:35.396]  It's just amazing.
[00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:39.138]  So those are some of the guests that are coming up today.
[00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:42.260]  Massive important news straight ahead after this break.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.381]  I will news blitz when we get back.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.941]  Here's a nice headline.
[00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:49.964]  Canadian military units to undertake domestic security.
[00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:52.727]  Duties would include mass internment of citizens.
[00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.328]  That's in the mainstream news.
[00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:58.292]  After terror attack, mirroring militarization of law enforcement in the U.S.
[00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:00.834]  and Britain.
[00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:02.195]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.617]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:08.781]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.623]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:24.915]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:31.297]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:31.297 --> 00:06:34.898]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:06:34.898 --> 00:06:39.299]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:40.019]  For the rest of you,
[00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:47.379]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.542]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:19.686]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:21.647]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:07:21.647 --> 00:07:24.108]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:37.294]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:07:37.294 --> 00:07:38.974]  It's not about left or right.
[00:07:38.974 --> 00:07:40.335]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:47.732]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:07:47.732 --> 00:07:55.999]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:57.581]  The Obama Deception.
[00:07:57.581 --> 00:07:58.762]  The people strike back.
[00:08:00.575 --> 00:08:04.017]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:08.278]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:19.924]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:08:19.924 --> 00:08:25.606]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:25.846]  I think so.
[00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:49.785]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com.
[00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:52.668]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A-Silver dot com.
[00:08:52.668 --> 00:08:53.208]  Or call 888-213-4338.
[00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:53.368]  888-213-4338.
[00:08:53.368 --> 00:08:54.329]  And help us win this battle.
[00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:55.370]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.991]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.691]  Ron Paul coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.993]  Stay with us.
[00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:23.815]  Canadian military units to undertake domestic security.
[00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:25.937]  Same thing happening in the United States and England.
[00:09:25.937 --> 00:09:31.040]  But this article admits it's going to be control and cordon, lockdown.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.744]  That their main mission is to not have casualties as they engage the people of Canada.
[00:09:37.515 --> 00:09:40.836]  All over the mainstream news of Canada right now.
[00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:43.717]  We are going in to total tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:46.898]  This is not a drill, this is not an exercise, this is it.
[00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:48.799]  Toe to toe with the new world order, we're going in.
[00:09:48.799 --> 00:10:05.265]  A key article by Kurt Nimmo up on InfoWars.com right now, fight back against the banker onslaught with the Obama deception, and then he gets into the rollout of the Obamanoid zombies on the streets of America.
[00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:31.642]  Now that Obama 2.0, also known as Organizing for America, will be going door-to-door publicly with hundreds of thousands of preachers, they've now announced, to map out and identify support, that's a quote, to map out and identify support for the bankster scam 2.0, it's time to have plenty of copies of the Obama deception at hand for family, neighbors, and for the Obamatrons who show up at your doorstep in need of education.
[00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:43.481]  And folks, within four minutes of the film starting, we break the left-right paradigm, we go after George Bush, show him as a New World Order, then they drop their left-right paradigm shield.
[00:10:43.481 --> 00:10:49.463]  We could instantly, if they watch this film, deprogram them, they can take the red pill.
[00:10:49.463 --> 00:10:51.164]  All we're offering is the truth, nothing more.
[00:10:52.537 --> 00:11:11.887]  The article continues, Obama is tooling up, or rather his DNC and Wall Street handlers are, a massive campaign to enlist millions of mesmerized and brainwashed supporters to quote, build support for the largest, most expensive, most audacious, and ultimately debilitating borrow and spend bill in the history of the world.
[00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:14.169]  That's right, they now want more banker takeovers.
[00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:16.491]  It is a banker dream come true.
[00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:22.778]  A scam designed to ensure your children and grandchildren are in hock to the international bankers for generations to come.
[00:11:22.778 --> 00:11:24.180]  And they all make it out of nothing.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.562]  Fiat currency.
[00:11:25.562 --> 00:11:28.205]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 53.4% since its high in October of 2007.
[00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:30.027]  And an unbelievable 31% since the inauguration of the new savior.
[00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:46.088]  Since Obama entered the White House, we have weathered a whopping 1.6 trillion loss in equity from a crippling concentration of the American economy by 6.2 percent.
[00:11:46.088 --> 00:11:53.095]  Unemployment jumped to 8.1 percent in February, after increasing 7.1 percent in January and 5.9 percent in December.
[00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:54.096]  And that's their cook numbers.
[00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:56.618]  It's more like 20 percent and intensifying.
[00:11:56.618 --> 00:11:58.019]  And you've got the working poor out there.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.062]  Make up the other folks.
[00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:12.517]  According to Mitch Stewart, Director of Organizing for America, Obama's budget provides a bold blueprint for our country's future, a dismal future of third world status and humiliating servitude, under the yoke of high-tech surveillance and control.
[00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:22.002]  Obama 2.0 zombies will take to the streets to sell you the horrendous prospect of trillions more in federal spending, taxes and debt.
[00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:31.512]  All of it designed to destroy real wealth and usher in a brave new world of serfdom and servitude to the global elite under the fallacious, yes we can exterior.
[00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.352]  And the news media is going to point at these rent-a-mobs.
[00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:38.873]  They're going to point at these millions of Obamanoids, going, we are socialists!
[00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:39.814]  Give us money!
[00:12:39.814 --> 00:12:42.555]  And they'll say, well, the people want it.
[00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:51.478]  Won't matter if the poll shows that one out of a thousand were for the banker takeover, or 95% were against the stimulus plan that was really a federalization plan.
[00:12:51.478 --> 00:12:56.420]  The media will just ignore all of that and say, the people love it!
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.420]  The people asked for it!
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.081]  And they're also billing it as socialism.
[00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:11.605]  Now socialism is bad because it makes us dependent on the establishment and they always use that to control us, but actually the socialism phase is now ending.
[00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:18.948]  Getting everybody domesticated, that's how you domesticate wild hogs or horses, you feed them for a few months and get them in a pen, close the pen when they come in to eat and then
[00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:30.198]  Really, usually you grab the young'uns, that's how you domesticate wolves is the best way, or horses, you get the cult, or you kill the adults and grab the piglets and make them stay with you for a while until they get trained.
[00:13:30.198 --> 00:13:36.280]  You put them in with other trained pigs, other trained horses, other trained cows, that is domesticated cows.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.801]  That's what the state sees as the children, and then most of them end up being government bureaucrats themselves.
[00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:42.642]  This is their own cult.
[00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:45.383]  They replicate themselves.
[00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:47.024]  But imagine the power
[00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:59.922]  Of getting the Obama deception on high-quality DVD at InfoWars.com, burning copies of it, and nicely going to Obama meetings using their ServiceUSA.com website.
[00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:15.325]  I saw this video that exposes George Bush, because it really does.
[00:14:15.325 --> 00:14:17.706]  Will you tell me what you think about it?
[00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:19.267]  Because they've always got local controllers.
[00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:22.768]  If you go in there and start saying he's a new world order global government, they'll kick you out.
[00:14:23.578 --> 00:14:24.859]  Another little meeting.
[00:14:24.859 --> 00:14:27.361]  No, just go in and observe and hang out and talk.
[00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:29.322]  You are infiltrating for the Republic.
[00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:32.104]  You are the counter-revolutionary force.
[00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.284]  You are the restorationists.
[00:14:33.284 --> 00:14:34.926]  They're destroying the Republic.
[00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:38.108]  You are white blood cells going into the infections.
[00:14:38.108 --> 00:14:52.397]  You go into the infection, you act friendly as a T-lymphocyte as you scan the enemy operation, you get intel, and then you go in and you deprogram.
[00:14:52.397 --> 00:14:53.338]  You deprogram.
[00:14:56.263 --> 00:15:00.705]  We must engage them at point-blank range, ladies and gentlemen, and you can do it.
[00:15:00.705 --> 00:15:06.227]  These are good people that believe that Obama is saving them from the horrible Bush agenda.
[00:15:06.227 --> 00:15:08.767]  They believe they're repudiating all of those horrors.
[00:15:08.767 --> 00:15:11.008]  They have no idea they're being set up.
[00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:13.929]  But some of them are starting to wake up to that fact.
[00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:16.770]  And when the Obamanoids come to your door, but I wouldn't wait for them to come to the door.
[00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.691]  I would go out to them.
[00:15:18.691 --> 00:15:19.791]  Time is too short.
[00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:24.013]  Everything the enemy has miscalculated, they have bet everything they've got on Obama.
[00:15:24.813 --> 00:15:30.777]  And they are going to fail if you take action, if you set yourself in motion.
[00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:33.439]  It's over.
[00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:47.210]  I will tell you right now that coming up Sunday night, the Obama deception is going to launch at PrisonPlanet.tv at 6 p.m.
[00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.372]  Central when I end the abbreviated two-hour Sunday show, the final edition.
[00:15:53.103 --> 00:16:02.535]  There's going to be a DivX format, which with a point-and-click you can burn to DVDs and discs, and it is, I'd say, 90% of the quality of a high-quality DVD.
[00:16:02.535 --> 00:16:06.640]  It looks like old-fashioned broadcast TV, you know, from like a year ago before they went digital.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.141]  It looks good!
[00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:11.100]  It looks so good, the way we encoded it.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:21.948]  It is in high def, it's shot in high def, but you have to downgrade it to put it on DVD, but the way we've learned how to compress, we actually got a consultant on this for Truth Rising, and now we know how to do it.
[00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:23.048]  It looks like high def.
[00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:27.011]  I mean, it's just so crisp and clear on the DVD, and that does support us.
[00:16:27.011 --> 00:16:28.912]  That's the seed money for us to operate.
[00:16:28.912 --> 00:16:33.155]  I hope you'll order the DVD at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:16:36.398 --> 00:16:40.412]  It'll take a few days to get these shipping out, coming up next Monday.
[00:16:40.412 --> 00:16:41.215]  Do not wait!
[00:16:42.802 --> 00:17:02.128]  If you don't know how to point-and-click and burn the DivX copy, or the Windows copy, or the QuickTime copies, or the Flash copies of disk, you get your tech-savvy brother, or sister, or son, or mother, or neighbor over, and let me tell you, you pop those DVDs in there, you pop those disks in there, and you start burning DivX.
[00:17:02.128 --> 00:17:06.349]  About half of the new DVD players that have been sold the last few years are DivX.
[00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.090]  They play regular DVDs and DivX.
[00:17:10.074 --> 00:17:23.301]  And you just go out there, and I'm telling you folks, you buy a couple hundred copies of disc and DVDs, very inexpensive, and I want you to burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
[00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:25.322]  And every one of them is an info hand grenade.
[00:17:26.055 --> 00:17:30.858]  You throw the hand grenade into a group of Obama supporters in the InfoWard of the Truth Bomb.
[00:17:30.858 --> 00:17:33.060]  It blows up with red pills.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:38.043]  Red pills shower, blast through them, and they wake up and realize they're being conned.
[00:17:38.043 --> 00:17:39.164]  It is a war.
[00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:40.145]  This is a weapon.
[00:17:41.124 --> 00:17:43.645]  The weapon drops 6 p.m.
[00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:44.885]  Central Standard Time.
[00:17:44.885 --> 00:17:45.645]  What is that?
[00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:47.386]  Midnight, Greenwich Mean Time.
[00:17:47.386 --> 00:17:49.886]  The weapon system has been prepared.
[00:17:49.886 --> 00:17:54.007]  The weapon system has been forged and carved out of truth.
[00:17:54.007 --> 00:17:58.528]  It is a powerful weapon to be plunged into the lie's heart, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:58.528 --> 00:18:05.910]  The Infowar countdown has begun.
[00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.711]  This is a weapon of truth and enlightenment.
[00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:11.940]  The Info War.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.861]  The Info War.
[00:18:12.861 --> 00:18:18.866]  The Info War starts with you.
[00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:20.848]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:23.591]  Get ready at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:28.775]  Get ready for the launch of the Obama deception.
[00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:29.376]  Incidentally,
[00:18:31.294 --> 00:18:40.637]  We have multiple computers around the country and in Austin, Texas with it already loaded into them, ready to jam it into the file sharing networks, Google Video and YouTube.
[00:18:40.637 --> 00:18:45.758]  We will not be stopped in bringing this information out.
[00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:50.600]  We've been getting a lot of threats and a lot of chicanery going on.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.241]  The enemy knows this is going to be powerful and I will tell them now,
[00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.886]  This film is going out.
[00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:00.247]  We trust in God and we know it's going to make it out.
[00:19:00.247 --> 00:19:01.367]  We know it's going to get it out.
[00:19:01.367 --> 00:19:05.088]  I'm tempted just to slam it in high gear and release it right now.
[00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:06.809]  In fact, I may just release it.
[00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:09.190]  I may release it right now.
[00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:15.552]  Because this sucker is going to blast the New World Order big time.
[00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:17.693]  And I want you, when it goes up on Google and YouTube,
[00:19:19.286 --> 00:19:23.990]  I want you to get it and I want you to put it on every MySpace account, every Facebook account.
[00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.212]  I want it to every email list over and over again.
[00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:30.036]  I want it to be posted on every message board and forum out there.
[00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:34.920]  I want it to immediately go mega viral supernova.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.105]  And then when these zombies come to your door, I want you to have DivX copies ready for them.
[00:19:40.105 --> 00:19:42.547]  And I want you to tell them, this is the red pill.
[00:19:42.547 --> 00:19:43.227]  You know, the Matrix?
[00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:45.893]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.253]  Nothing more.
[00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:48.554]  You've been betrayed.
[00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.594]  Bush and Obama are evil.
[00:19:50.594 --> 00:19:51.875]  Do you truly want to fix things?
[00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:56.037]  Do you truly want real change?
[00:19:56.037 --> 00:19:58.317]  Here's the red pill.
[00:19:58.317 --> 00:20:03.119]  And then just shut the door.
[00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.300]  Countdown.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:04.760]  Countdown.
[00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:07.196]  In fact, that's it.
[00:20:07.196 --> 00:20:07.977]  We're launching early.
[00:20:07.977 --> 00:20:10.678]  I can't control myself.
[00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:11.458]  You know what?
[00:20:11.458 --> 00:20:13.099]  In a way, there's two schools of thought.
[00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:15.920]  Building up the momentum and then launching it on that date.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.761]  I'll have to think about it.
[00:20:18.761 --> 00:20:21.243]  I have to think about it.
[00:20:21.243 --> 00:20:23.704]  I have to think about it.
[00:20:23.704 --> 00:20:25.785]  It's just so much is going on.
[00:20:25.785 --> 00:20:26.585]  So much is happening.
[00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:28.066]  The enemy is moving so quick.
[00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:30.767]  I want to drop now.
[00:20:30.767 --> 00:20:32.048]  I'm over the target right now.
[00:20:32.048 --> 00:20:32.428]  Why not?
[00:20:33.444 --> 00:20:35.105]  Should we release it now?
[00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:38.386]  Bombs away on the info war?
[00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:40.667]  Or should we wait?
[00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:43.148]  Building up the momentum.
[00:20:43.148 --> 00:20:50.951]  Building up the big dynamos, the servos, the reactor core.
[00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:57.894]  As the huge generators power up to fire a devastating blow against the globalists.
[00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:07.551]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:21:07.551 --> 00:21:13.975]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:19.718]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:21.799]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:26.481]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:27.381]  What then?
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.162]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:21:33.162 --> 00:21:37.484]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:40.366]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:47.590]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.491]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:21:49.491 --> 00:21:54.893]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:21:54.893 --> 00:21:57.635]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:21:57.635 --> 00:21:58.415]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:22:00.996 --> 00:22:06.800]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:13.784]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.378 --> 00:22:20.961]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:22.942]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:25.443]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.443 --> 00:22:36.387]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.006 --> 00:22:38.688]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.688 --> 00:22:40.549]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:47.456]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.456 --> 00:22:55.723]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.723 --> 00:22:57.305]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.305 --> 00:22:58.486]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.953 --> 00:23:05.534]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[00:23:05.534 --> 00:23:17.857]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[00:23:17.857 --> 00:23:23.459]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[00:23:23.459 --> 00:23:24.899]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[00:23:25.453 --> 00:23:31.452]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:36.427]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[00:23:36.427 --> 00:23:37.228]  Give me a call.
[00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:45.972]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[00:23:45.972 --> 00:23:47.653]  That's Peter Kronschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:23:47.653 --> 00:23:52.015]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[00:24:00.143 --> 00:24:03.646]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:24:03.646 --> 00:24:05.567]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:11.131]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:24:11.131 --> 00:24:18.836]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:24:19.156 --> 00:24:31.961]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.
[00:24:31.961 --> 00:24:37.143]  Renaissance Charge offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and sizes of batteries.
[00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:42.305]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.
[00:24:42.665 --> 00:24:43.787]  Save your money.
[00:24:43.787 --> 00:24:45.108]  Save the environment.
[00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:48.112]  Visit us online at r-charge.com.
[00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:50.355]  That's r-charge.com.
[00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:51.136]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:51.597]  That's 989-637-4179.
[00:24:51.597 --> 00:24:52.918]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:25:14.327 --> 00:25:15.695]  Another lonely day
[00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:38.023]  This is an SOS.
[00:25:38.023 --> 00:25:40.925]  The Republic's been seized by offshore banks.
[00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:47.110]  England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States are falling to classic military tyranny.
[00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.531]  The coup d'etat has been launched.
[00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:50.493]  A corporate takeover is near completion.
[00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:55.195]  The people must be alerted to this fraud immediately or they're going to go into the next phase.
[00:25:55.195 --> 00:26:00.598]  Total depression, total implosion by design to cause worldwide rioting and bring in a world government.
[00:26:00.598 --> 00:26:08.343]  They'll then turn the economy on for a time to sell everybody that globalism is the answer and then they will clamp down even stronger after that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:12.168]  Fight back against the banker onslaught with the Obama deception.
[00:26:12.168 --> 00:26:20.318]  Order your DVDs now at InfoWars.com and get ready for the release coming up this Sunday evening at 6 p.m.
[00:26:20.318 --> 00:26:25.124]  We're having an intense debate about launching it Friday.
[00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:27.306]  I will tell you that right now.
[00:26:28.948 --> 00:26:33.509]  I normally do launch things about 12 hours early, and then we don't announce it.
[00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:39.471]  It's a beta test to make sure everything's working, but we have so many CDNs and backup servers and systems out there.
[00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:43.412]  But get ready at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:43.412 --> 00:26:44.953]  Why am I so hyped up, folks?
[00:26:44.953 --> 00:26:51.575]  Because things are getting absolutely crazy right now.
[00:26:51.575 --> 00:26:52.335]  Look at this story.
[00:26:53.482 --> 00:27:01.730]  This is from PrisonPlanet.com and it is hyperlinked to all the mainstream news backing up the claims we make here.
[00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.194]  In fact, most of this article is simply quotes from the mainstream news.
[00:27:05.194 --> 00:27:08.477]  Now listen to this carefully.
[00:27:08.477 --> 00:27:10.539]  Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the FEMA camps are real.
[00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:11.780]  Listen to this.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:16.125]  Canadian military units to undertake domestic security.
[00:27:17.423 --> 00:27:27.450]  Duties would include mass internment of citizens after terrorist attack mirroring militarization of law enforcement in US and Britain.
[00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:39.999]  The Canadian military is reorganizing its priorities to suit a post 9-11 world by creating reservist units for each area of the country that would be tasked with providing domestic security.
[00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:40.560]  That's a quote.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.244]  It involves such roles as the mass internment of citizens in the event of a terrorist attack.
[00:27:47.253 --> 00:27:52.456]  When you read their Army War College and our Army War College, they say it's for the American people, to fight us.
[00:27:52.456 --> 00:28:04.682]  The Canadian military has embarked on a wide-ranging plan to turn its reserve soldiers into force units trained and equipped to respond to a nightmarish array of domestic threats, reports the National Post.
[00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:07.804]  Same thing's been announced by the Pentagon under Northcom.
[00:28:07.804 --> 00:28:10.526]  The remodeling of the Reservist will see the development
[00:28:11.368 --> 00:28:15.191]  of specialist units in four of the military's regional divisions.
[00:28:15.191 --> 00:28:19.534]  Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, and the West.
[00:28:19.534 --> 00:28:22.496]  We're broken into ten FEMA regions here in the United States.
[00:28:22.496 --> 00:28:35.305]  This is an open announcement that Canada has been subdivided into military units that will be policed by military reserves, who will take a quote, dominant role in domestic operations in the future, according to the article.
[00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:43.846]  Of course, the necessity of the change is dressed up using the notion of troops helping people in the event of earthquakes, floods, and nuclear accidents.
[00:28:43.846 --> 00:28:56.449]  But we also learned from one of the duties that the Reservists would potentially undertake would be mass internment of citizens in camps or quarantine zones after a biological terror attack.
[00:28:56.449 --> 00:28:59.189]  We are training to establish a perimeter.
[00:28:59.189 --> 00:29:03.130]  What was the Ohio Guard doing wanting to go door-to-door to search people's houses and cupboards, remember?
[00:29:04.431 --> 00:29:04.711]  Oh, probably.
[00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:06.332]  Let me read what the Brigadier General said.
[00:29:24.753 --> 00:29:28.554]  Well, we might be obliged to keep people in, probably.
[00:29:28.554 --> 00:29:34.937]  You need to be trained to be able to make sure that you don't become a casualty in the process of doing security.
[00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:36.437]  That's another quote.
[00:29:36.437 --> 00:29:40.439]  They don't want to be a casualty when they're dealing with the Canadian people.
[00:29:40.439 --> 00:29:43.079]  We are trained to establish perimeter.
[00:29:43.079 --> 00:29:47.001]  In light of that comment, it is interesting to note that according to the report, Brigadier General
[00:29:49.096 --> 00:29:58.061]  Colin, who has served in Bosnia and Afghanistan, has also been a special advisor to the Chief of the Defense Staff of Homeland Security Issues.
[00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:11.688]  Other roles for the military reservists would be to undertake law enforcement and other security duties for domestic events such as the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver and the 2010 G8 Summit of World Leaders in Huntsville.
[00:30:11.688 --> 00:30:13.749]  The story dovetails with a report out of
[00:30:15.194 --> 00:30:29.082]  Ontario or authorities, and that's mainstream news, are considering using, and then you read the article already doing it, using troops from local army bases to patrol bar areas on weekends in a supposed attempt to prevent rowdiness.
[00:30:29.082 --> 00:30:33.805]  It's like the Marines are here running DWI checkpoints, breaking the ice, conditioning you, PR.
[00:30:34.525 --> 00:30:42.467]  We'll come back, finish up with this and a lot more vital economic news, vital news on Iran and the military.
[00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:43.868]  It's all coming up.
[00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:45.708]  Ron Paul and others.
[00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:47.749]  Stay with us.
[00:30:47.749 --> 00:30:50.910]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.330]  We're on the march.
[00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.851]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:54.851 --> 00:31:00.973]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:31:00.973 --> 00:31:01.453]  You worry.
[00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:03.924]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:31:03.924 --> 00:31:06.566]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:31:06.566 --> 00:31:08.708]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:31:08.708 --> 00:31:10.309]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:13.911]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:31:13.911 --> 00:31:19.134]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:31:19.134 --> 00:31:23.117]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:31:23.117 --> 00:31:24.798]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:31:24.798 --> 00:31:27.700]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.642]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:39.788]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:31:39.788 --> 00:31:44.611]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:48.634]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[00:31:52.657 --> 00:31:54.038]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:31:54.038 --> 00:31:55.760]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:32:01.207 --> 00:32:06.440]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:07.239 --> 00:32:13.102]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:19.606]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:32:19.606 --> 00:32:21.587]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:32:21.587 --> 00:32:24.048]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:32:24.048 --> 00:32:34.934]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.891]  It's not about left or right.
[00:32:38.891 --> 00:32:40.753]  It's about a one world government.
[00:32:40.753 --> 00:32:47.659]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:32:55.925 --> 00:32:57.507]  The Obama Deception.
[00:32:57.507 --> 00:32:58.688]  The people strike back.
[00:33:01.098 --> 00:33:04.920]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.005]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:33:12.005 --> 00:33:13.486]  Here is why.
[00:33:13.486 --> 00:33:23.412]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:33:23.932 --> 00:33:26.655]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:28.797]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:33:28.797 --> 00:33:29.757]  this fall?
[00:33:29.757 --> 00:33:30.698]  Don't wait.
[00:33:30.698 --> 00:33:34.642]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.721]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:11.362]  It's the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:34:11.362 --> 00:34:14.924]  As we crash through the lies and disinformation.
[00:34:14.924 --> 00:34:23.008]  As we wage war on corruption.
[00:34:23.008 --> 00:34:29.351]  There's a warning sign.
[00:34:44.756 --> 00:34:49.260]  Keep on rockin'!
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.901]  This is it.
[00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:50.982]  You want to be part of history?
[00:34:50.982 --> 00:34:52.003]  You want to stand up to evil?
[00:34:52.003 --> 00:34:54.865]  You want your life to really matter?
[00:34:54.865 --> 00:35:01.731]  This is the fight with the global bankers that funded Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and many others.
[00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:07.116]  The globalists publicly funded Ho Chi Minh and set him up, then double-crossed him to have a war.
[00:35:07.116 --> 00:35:08.778]  They publicly funded Fidel Castro.
[00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.992]  They want to wreck society so they can consolidate.
[00:35:12.992 --> 00:35:14.413]  They hate our Republic.
[00:35:14.413 --> 00:35:16.034]  They hate the United States.
[00:35:16.034 --> 00:35:18.356]  And they must be defeated!
[00:35:18.356 --> 00:35:23.940]  Your children have no future if you don't rise to the occasion and engage the New World Order!
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.301]  This is it!
[00:35:25.301 --> 00:35:27.943]  No more time to suck your thumbs or screw around!
[00:35:27.943 --> 00:35:32.767]  It's now time to take action!
[00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:34.088]  Because there's a woman in the night.
[00:35:51.207 --> 00:36:14.285]  How dare them increase the amount of opium by tenfold and publicly have the military protect the poppies in Afghanistan and ship it into our country!
[00:36:14.285 --> 00:36:18.268]  How dare them ship in cocaine and make it cool through Hollywood!
[00:36:19.366 --> 00:36:23.028]  How dare them try to put our children on Ritalin and Prozac?
[00:36:23.028 --> 00:36:29.570]  How dare them kidnap over a million children a year outside the court system through CPS?
[00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.432]  How dare them inject the public with their deadly vaccines, killing and maiming millions?
[00:36:34.432 --> 00:36:40.335]  How dare the globalists carry out their disgusting, totally wicked eugenics program?
[00:36:41.536 --> 00:36:43.997]  And how dare us not fight harder?
[00:36:43.997 --> 00:36:52.578]  How dare the people not resist in this one life to live when we're faced one inch away from our noses with pure wickedness?
[00:36:52.578 --> 00:36:55.719]  How could any of you deny what we're seeing?
[00:36:55.719 --> 00:37:00.940]  How could any of you not rise to the challenge?
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:06.541]  How could any of you not fulfill your destinies?
[00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:08.022]  Take it in your hands.
[00:37:08.022 --> 00:37:09.742]  Be what you were meant to be.
[00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:17.701]  Yeah, the machine gun hand.
[00:37:42.791 --> 00:37:44.032]  We are back live.
[00:37:44.032 --> 00:37:46.833]  We are defending the free world in its darkest hour.
[00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:53.835]  The United States and every other free nation cannot fall from without.
[00:37:53.835 --> 00:37:55.856]  They must fall from within.
[00:37:55.856 --> 00:37:59.238]  So the battle for the Republic is within.
[00:37:59.238 --> 00:38:02.159]  And it is to each of you out there.
[00:38:03.243 --> 00:38:09.488]  To be part of history on the side of good, and to come in and be part of the big win against the New World Order.
[00:38:09.488 --> 00:38:13.891]  Intellectually, the police and military want to join us and are joining us.
[00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:18.594]  And in their heart and soul, they know we're right and they want to join us.
[00:38:18.594 --> 00:38:20.095]  They are pulled towards the light.
[00:38:20.095 --> 00:38:21.937]  They don't like the dark.
[00:38:21.937 --> 00:38:24.839]  But through peer pressure and conditioning, they have been made to accept it.
[00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.151]  Money doesn't matter.
[00:38:28.151 --> 00:38:29.651]  Power doesn't matter.
[00:38:29.651 --> 00:38:31.352]  Trinkets and status don't matter.
[00:38:31.352 --> 00:38:37.854]  Liberty and justice and honor and duty and everything decent and wholesome is what matters.
[00:38:37.854 --> 00:38:40.816]  And it must be paid for!
[00:38:40.816 --> 00:38:42.756]  It doesn't come free!
[00:38:42.756 --> 00:38:48.659]  It doesn't come cheap!
[00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:53.861]  But the truth is, you will not be fulfilled until you are fighting evil.
[00:38:55.646 --> 00:39:00.610]  You were meant when God formed you in your mother's womb, He knew you.
[00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:09.157]  And you were meant from the foundations of the earth, the creator of the universe knew you and loved you and gave you free will.
[00:39:09.157 --> 00:39:25.050]  And the God of this world wants to ensure that you don't get a chance to take part in the great things of life and the great mysteries and that you not grow and that you not go through tribulation, that you be weak and sit on the sidelines so that you can fall and be engulfed
[00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:28.852]  And be overtaken by evil.
[00:39:28.852 --> 00:39:35.974]  Alright, continuing with the news blitz here as we have Ron Paul coming up and others.
[00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:55.780]  It is being reported, by the way, in the Irish newspapers that just as last week the cricket team got machine gunned and police just a few feet away stood down and weren't even scared of the shooters, clearly knew them, the body language is there from multiple surveillance cameras, and walked away.
[00:39:58.126 --> 00:40:00.347]  Walked away.
[00:40:00.347 --> 00:40:01.547]  Taking their time.
[00:40:01.547 --> 00:40:12.492]  It's now being reported in the Australian, in the Metro News of the UK, London Guardian.
[00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:16.173]  It's being reported in the Belfast Telegraph.
[00:40:16.173 --> 00:40:20.775]  It's being reported in the Sunday Mail.
[00:40:20.775 --> 00:40:26.377]  Headline, armed guards stood by as British soldiers shot at Northern Ireland base.
[00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.034]  Another headline, guards stood by as soldiers murdered.
[00:40:31.034 --> 00:40:33.318]  Always the same MO.
[00:40:33.318 --> 00:40:36.223]  We're now getting intel there was probably a drill going on at the time.
[00:40:36.223 --> 00:40:39.970]  That way if the terrorists were caught, MI5, MI6, they'd say yes.
[00:40:40.987 --> 00:40:42.768]  They could say it was just part of a drill.
[00:40:42.768 --> 00:40:44.909]  Remember what was in the London Guardian and BBC?
[00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.010]  They had to admit they were caught in Basra.
[00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.472]  It's in my film Terror Storm.
[00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:58.777]  This happened three and a half years ago, dressed up like Arabs, running around shooting and killing Iraqi police and US and British troops.
[00:40:59.704 --> 00:41:00.825]  They were caught.
[00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.726]  They were put in a jail cell.
[00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:08.550]  British forces then struck their own provisional police and went in and removed them.
[00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:16.535]  But not before the photos of them with the fake beards were put out and it was admitted they were staging terrorist attacks.
[00:41:16.535 --> 00:41:19.937]  They don't want the people of Northern and Southern Ireland living in peace.
[00:41:19.937 --> 00:41:21.498]  They want the fighting to continue.
[00:41:21.498 --> 00:41:28.103]  It's been documented that more than 75% of the leadership of the different IRA subgroups were commanded
[00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:33.988]  By MI5, MI6, British SAS.
[00:41:33.988 --> 00:41:38.475]  We've had former SAS commandos on the show.
[00:41:38.475 --> 00:41:40.839]  We've interviewed people that were killed.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.700]  After they were on the show.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.681]  That's right.
[00:41:44.681 --> 00:41:46.721]  People die.
[00:41:46.721 --> 00:41:48.602]  Again, this isn't a game.
[00:41:48.602 --> 00:41:49.522]  This isn't a joke.
[00:41:49.522 --> 00:41:51.482]  People ask how I can be so intense.
[00:41:51.482 --> 00:41:57.464]  Or why I don't talk about cooking recipes and why I don't talk about barbecuing tricks.
[00:41:57.464 --> 00:42:02.825]  Because I, ladies and gentlemen, have put myself in the center of the arena.
[00:42:02.825 --> 00:42:06.526]  I am committed and it feels good.
[00:42:06.526 --> 00:42:08.467]  Because this is where I'm meant to be.
[00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:09.907]  This is what I was born to do.
[00:42:11.564 --> 00:42:19.808]  And there are those of you out there much stronger, much more intelligent, much harder working than I, that could blow away all of my work.
[00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:21.229]  And I want you to.
[00:42:21.229 --> 00:42:27.332]  I want you to realize that you don't believe you have power, but you do have power.
[00:42:27.332 --> 00:42:34.116]  The leaders we need to defeat this system are out there everywhere right now.
[00:42:34.116 --> 00:42:37.658]  So get past your fear and join the battle for the Republic.
[00:42:41.314 --> 00:42:44.635]  Join in the defense of the planet against the New World Order.
[00:42:44.635 --> 00:42:48.975]  So that is coming up later in the show.
[00:42:48.975 --> 00:42:52.876]  One police officer shot dead, two members of the military.
[00:42:52.876 --> 00:42:56.117]  Clearly a staged event.
[00:42:56.117 --> 00:43:00.978]  It was an inside job, just like it always is.
[00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:06.899]  And while you were sleeping, this little island disappeared.
[00:43:08.379 --> 00:43:12.989]  While you were looking the other way.
[00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:17.077]  They took your right to own your own ideas.
[00:43:17.077 --> 00:43:18.860]  And it's an inside job.
[00:43:24.892 --> 00:43:45.043]  Meanwhile, Canadian military units prepare to put their citizens in FEMA camps, and for the military to patrol the streets of Canada, openly being announced, as it's openly being announced in every other Western nation, being overtaken by the private banking syndicate, the criminals.
[00:43:45.043 --> 00:43:50.286]  You know, I began plugging the Obama deception, it's explosive release coming up this weekend.
[00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:53.869]  And I didn't even give out the toll-free number, I believe.
[00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:58.992]  I hope everybody will call and order the DVD now at 888-253-3139.
[00:43:58.992 --> 00:44:03.974]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:10.137]  And I want you to get the DVD and I want you to make copies of it and get it out to everyone you know.
[00:44:10.137 --> 00:44:15.100]  And when these Obama zombies come to your door promoting their New World Order, which they're now
[00:44:16.124 --> 00:44:17.806]  Launching them to do?
[00:44:17.806 --> 00:44:22.572]  You can give them the Obama deception, which is a red pill to get them out of the matrix.
[00:44:22.572 --> 00:44:33.224]  It is a rope, a ladder, to help them get out of the muck of mind control and bondage that they're in.
[00:44:33.224 --> 00:44:34.285]  Finishing up with this article.
[00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:44.801]  The story dovetails with a report out of Ontario where authorities are considering using troops, and then it admits in the article they're already doing it, with a local army base to patrol bar areas on weekends.
[00:44:44.801 --> 00:44:45.982]  You're for stopping drunks, are you?
[00:44:45.982 --> 00:44:47.522]  See, same thing being done in the U.S.
[00:44:47.522 --> 00:44:49.803]  The Marines are here at the checkpoints to stop drunks.
[00:44:49.803 --> 00:44:50.903]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[00:44:50.903 --> 00:44:52.483]  We've got to do something about the drunks.
[00:44:52.483 --> 00:44:54.544]  Meanwhile, they admit, oh, and by the way, we're going to put you in FEMA camps.
[00:44:54.544 --> 00:44:56.484]  We're just getting you ready.
[00:44:56.484 --> 00:45:02.166]  Using troops from the local army base to patrol bar areas on weekends in a supposed attempt to prevent rowdiness.
[00:45:04.909 --> 00:45:15.012]  Mention is also made of scenarios that might require a form of constabulary or policing function for reserves in civilian containment and security.
[00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:16.793]  Civilian containment!
[00:45:16.793 --> 00:45:18.834]  Containment of your cities!
[00:45:18.834 --> 00:45:20.414]  FEMA camps!
[00:45:20.414 --> 00:45:21.775]  The Warsaw Ghetto!
[00:45:21.775 --> 00:45:22.795]  It is here!
[00:45:22.795 --> 00:45:25.196]  They are announcing it because they're preparing to launch!
[00:45:26.141 --> 00:45:28.984]  They are considering pulling the trigger.
[00:45:28.984 --> 00:45:31.727]  And you're not going to hear this radio show anymore.
[00:45:31.727 --> 00:45:34.489]  It could come any day, any week, any month, any year.
[00:45:34.489 --> 00:45:44.359]  Every time we have victories and back them off, our enemies crow and cackle and say, where is the martial law, as they openly put troops on the streets and build the camps.
[00:45:44.359 --> 00:45:47.723]  Understand this is an ongoing battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:56.284]  We back them off on the North American Union, Security Prosperity Partnership, the Superhighways, Trans-Texas Corridor, and of course they come back and rename it and continue it.
[00:45:56.284 --> 00:45:58.365]  And then we go back and expose how they're liars!
[00:45:58.365 --> 00:46:01.107]  And then they come back again with more lies and we expose them again!
[00:46:01.107 --> 00:46:01.847]  We fight them!
[00:46:01.847 --> 00:46:02.708]  And we fight them!
[00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:03.548]  And we fight them!
[00:46:03.548 --> 00:46:04.349]  And we fight them!
[00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:05.149]  And we fight them!
[00:46:05.149 --> 00:46:05.829]  And we fight them!
[00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:06.510]  And we fight them!
[00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.210]  And we fight them!
[00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:07.890]  And we fight them!
[00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:08.631]  And we fight them!
[00:46:08.631 --> 00:46:09.171]  And we fight them!
[00:46:09.171 --> 00:46:10.072]  And we never surrender!
[00:46:10.072 --> 00:46:12.613]  We never give up!
[00:46:12.613 --> 00:46:15.795]  We stand up in a bold fashion against these criminals.
[00:46:18.097 --> 00:46:24.620]  And we expose their criminal operations to the fullest extent.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:39.186]  And I love the idea of the guy with the Alex Jones 2012 website, I forget the exact address, who's saying, you know, male terror storm and endgame and Obama deception when it comes out, to all the National Guard who are now North Com.
[00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:43.588]  I mean, if you know somebody in the National Guard, that is a jewel in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:46:43.588 --> 00:46:44.969]  That is, that is
[00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:54.171]  You ought to be fighting with yourselves, you know, stumbling over each other, trying to get to the military to wake them up and to inform them.
[00:46:54.171 --> 00:46:56.232]  And you're going to find they're already freaked out.
[00:46:56.232 --> 00:46:59.432]  They already know many of them.
[00:46:59.432 --> 00:47:05.434]  Because if we can reach the police and military, the bankers will back off and they will turn the economy back on.
[00:47:05.434 --> 00:47:06.694]  They're the ones bad-mouthing the economy.
[00:47:06.694 --> 00:47:08.114]  They're the ones that cut off liquidity.
[00:47:08.114 --> 00:47:10.015]  They're the ones bragging how they engineered this.
[00:47:12.076 --> 00:47:18.100]  They're not ever going to turn the economy back on until we have them arrested for treason and criminal racketeering.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:18.841]  You understand that?
[00:47:18.841 --> 00:47:25.465]  The only solution is the Republic rising and arresting these criminals.
[00:47:25.465 --> 00:47:33.971]  I am boldly calling for their arrest.
[00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:38.294]  And boy, I can feel the sword of Damocles come closer to my neck when I do that, but it doesn't matter.
[00:47:38.294 --> 00:47:39.515]  I have committed
[00:47:41.598 --> 00:47:48.343]  To go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, and to never surrender.
[00:47:48.343 --> 00:47:55.289]  Like Winston Churchill said, we shall go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:58.011]  We shall fight.
[00:47:58.011 --> 00:47:59.131]  We shall fight in the hills.
[00:47:59.131 --> 00:48:00.833]  We shall fight in the valleys.
[00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:06.097]  We shall fight with growing strength and confidence on the internet.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.801]  We shall fight in the churches.
[00:48:09.801 --> 00:48:14.743]  We shall fight for the minds of free humans everywhere.
[00:48:14.743 --> 00:48:20.107]  And we shall never surrender.
[00:48:20.107 --> 00:48:22.108]  In fact, I want to come in with that in the next segment.
[00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:23.489]  I think I sent it to you a year ago.
[00:48:23.489 --> 00:48:25.770]  I don't think I've ever heard it played, John.
[00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.231]  YouTube, aces high.
[00:48:28.231 --> 00:48:33.194]  And I want it with the intro with Churchill when we come back in.
[00:48:33.194 --> 00:48:35.595]  Okay, buddy?
[00:48:35.595 --> 00:48:36.296]  Aces high.
[00:48:39.952 --> 00:48:47.910]  And we'll come in with that in the next segment.
[00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.576]  What an abomination this article is to see what they're doing.
[00:48:56.499 --> 00:49:08.085]  Would reservists opposed to the use of military units for purposes of domestic law enforcement not show up, or would they just follow orders under the jurisdiction of a breakdown authority after a biological attack or a mass rioting after a total economic collapse?
[00:49:08.085 --> 00:49:21.473]  I'm not so confident that people who have been kicking down doors, abducting, torturing, and killing people in Afghanistan for seven years under the justification that they are terrorists would be unwilling to do the same to Canadian citizens if they were drilled with the same propaganda.
[00:49:22.199 --> 00:49:27.582]  The militarization of law enforcement duties in the U.S., Canada, and Britain is accelerating at a pace never before seen.
[00:49:27.582 --> 00:49:31.303]  Yeah, it's at warp ten.
[00:49:31.303 --> 00:49:34.465]  Last week it was revealed the British Army is on stand-by to deal with rioting in the U.K.
[00:49:34.465 --> 00:49:42.729]  streets as a result of economic crises, according to the newspaper report, which states that MI5 is targeting political activists who could help to create a summer of discontent.
[00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:47.171]  And then these very anarchist groups that they list, we've tracked them, they're feds, been proven to be feds.
[00:49:48.063 --> 00:49:51.225]  You'll have peaceful people out with baby strollers protesting.
[00:49:51.225 --> 00:49:53.507]  Feds will attack other police just like they did this year in Denver.
[00:49:53.507 --> 00:49:54.208]  Now Denver Post.
[00:49:54.208 --> 00:49:55.048]  Police Admin.
[00:49:55.048 --> 00:50:01.974]  And they are going to savagely attack crowds.
[00:50:01.974 --> 00:50:03.355]  But what are you going to do in the US?
[00:50:03.355 --> 00:50:05.617]  We're not disarmed like they are in Australia and the UK.
[00:50:08.058 --> 00:50:17.368]  Meanwhile, in the U.S., urban warfare training drills are taking place across the country, as NORTHCOM announces that tens of thousands of active-duty troops will be stationed inside the United States for domestic purposes.
[00:50:17.368 --> 00:50:17.748]  The U.S.
[00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:25.176]  Army War College in November released a white paper called, Known Unknowns, Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defense Strategy Development.
[00:50:27.278 --> 00:50:34.962]  The report warns the military must be prepared for a violent strategic dislocation inside the United States which could be provoked by unforeseen economic collapse.
[00:50:34.962 --> 00:50:35.663]  They foresaw it.
[00:50:35.663 --> 00:50:36.583]  They triggered it.
[00:50:36.583 --> 00:50:37.884]  Purposeful domestic resistance.
[00:50:37.884 --> 00:50:38.444]  That's a quote.
[00:50:38.444 --> 00:50:40.685]  Purposeful domestic resistance by the states.
[00:50:40.685 --> 00:50:42.406]  NORTHCOM is aimed at the governors.
[00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:46.969]  Pervasive public health emergencies or loss of functioning political and legal order.
[00:50:49.417 --> 00:50:59.325]  The widespread civil violence, the document said, would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities and extremes to defend basic domestic order and human security.
[00:51:02.887 --> 00:51:05.789]  I think this article needs to be read by more people.
[00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:08.711]  Canadian military to undertake domestic security.
[00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:14.396]  Especially if you live in the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, under the Queen's control.
[00:51:14.396 --> 00:51:16.017]  And we are under the Queen's control.
[00:51:16.017 --> 00:51:20.200]  Obama, of course, will go kneel before her ahead of the Globalist Summit.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.242]  An unprecedented act by a U.S.
[00:51:22.242 --> 00:51:23.843]  President.
[00:51:23.843 --> 00:51:27.746]  They're publicly knighting the last gaggle of crooks that left the Bush administration.
[00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:31.323]  The move is upon us.
[00:51:31.323 --> 00:51:37.288]  Military and financial dictatorship over our beloved Republic.
[00:51:37.288 --> 00:51:42.513]  All of you that claim you swore an oath to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:51:42.513 --> 00:51:44.755]  There's no more time to live in denial.
[00:51:44.755 --> 00:51:46.837]  The facts are in your face.
[00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.378]  We were right about it all.
[00:51:48.378 --> 00:51:52.202]  We were only reading the globalist blueprints and white papers.
[00:51:52.202 --> 00:51:52.942]  I ask you now.
[00:51:53.763 --> 00:51:55.564]  Which side are you on?
[00:51:55.564 --> 00:51:57.386]  Who do you stand with?
[00:51:57.386 --> 00:51:58.587]  Make the decision!
[00:51:58.587 --> 00:51:59.427]  Choose now!
[00:52:00.672 --> 00:52:06.156]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.998]  How will you feed your family?
[00:52:07.998 --> 00:52:15.343]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:52:15.343 --> 00:52:22.789]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:26.372]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.
[00:52:26.372 --> 00:52:30.395]  We offer a complete range of seeds, including heirloom tomatoes, old-fashioned beans,
[00:52:30.615 --> 00:52:31.195]  I think so.
[00:53:01.016 --> 00:53:06.822]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:53:06.822 --> 00:53:13.810]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:53:14.398 --> 00:53:20.983]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:53:20.983 --> 00:53:22.964]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:53:22.964 --> 00:53:25.466]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:53:25.466 --> 00:53:36.413]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:53:37.043 --> 00:53:38.704]  It's not about left or right.
[00:53:38.704 --> 00:53:40.564]  It's about a one world government.
[00:53:40.564 --> 00:53:47.467]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.310]  The Obama Deception.
[00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:58.491]  The people strike back.

[00:54:47.845 --> 00:54:51.948]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[00:54:51.948 --> 00:54:54.470]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:55.731]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today!
[00:55:26.432 --> 00:55:34.417]  England, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Western Europe, Northern Europe, Latin America, Africa.
[00:55:34.417 --> 00:55:38.480]  There are assassinations, killings, overthrows.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.062]  It's all beginning across the planet.
[00:55:42.062 --> 00:55:43.843]  The New World Order is marching.
[00:55:43.843 --> 00:55:45.124]  They're pulling out all the stops.
[00:55:45.124 --> 00:55:45.925]  They're on the move.
[00:56:01.747 --> 00:56:02.808]  The attack is now!
[00:56:02.808 --> 00:56:13.993]  Let's go ahead and play a little bit of Winston Churchill, of course, who actually helped fund Hitler and the Milner Group and set it all up, but here he was rallying the British people during the Battle of Britain.
[00:56:13.993 --> 00:56:22.677]  Here it is.
[00:56:22.677 --> 00:56:27.439]  Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization.
[00:56:27.439 --> 00:56:29.920]  Upon it depends our own British life
[00:56:30.529 --> 00:56:34.471]  And the long continuity of our institutions and our empire.
[00:56:34.471 --> 00:56:41.614]  The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us.
[00:56:41.614 --> 00:56:47.056]  Hitler knows that he will have to break us in these islands or lose the war.
[00:56:47.056 --> 00:56:57.381]  If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.
[00:56:57.381 --> 00:57:00.022]  But if we fail, then the whole world
[00:57:00.945 --> 00:57:18.297]  Including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age, made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the likes of perverted science.
[00:57:18.297 --> 00:57:21.179]  Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties.
[00:57:21.179 --> 00:57:29.305]  So bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years,
[00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:37.033]  They will still say, this was their final hour.
[00:57:37.033 --> 00:57:38.133]  Ah, the empire.
[00:57:38.133 --> 00:57:43.615]  It's actually the empire taking over right now, and whether you're American or British, it doesn't matter.
[00:57:43.615 --> 00:57:50.998]  We are being enslaved and completely bankrupted by the transnational banks right now, publicly.
[00:57:50.998 --> 00:57:55.520]  And they've now had Larry Summers crawl out from underneath a rock
[00:57:56.665 --> 00:58:04.387]  at the White House and say we need trillions more for the bankers and smile and snicker and rub his rat-like hands together.
[00:58:04.387 --> 00:58:10.188]  This is an economic takeover, not some enemy coming across the sea.
[00:58:10.188 --> 00:58:15.890]  But to back up their corporate seizure, their hijacking of our free nations,
[00:58:16.994 --> 00:58:18.775]  They use Northcom.
[00:58:18.775 --> 00:58:36.561]  They use their military forces to do it, but these military forces, their grandmothers, their fathers, their mothers, their cousins, their brothers, their neighbors, their communities are going to be enslaved by this, and they're going to lower our standard of living and bring in a high-tech, Stasi-type state.
[00:58:36.561 --> 00:58:38.742]  So I say to those out there,
[00:58:41.334 --> 00:58:45.876]  I say to those who have sat on the fence about this, there's no more time for that.
[00:58:45.876 --> 00:58:48.358]  Now, I know that I do radio interviews almost every day.
[00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.619]  I better cut back because I've been so busy.
[00:58:50.619 --> 00:58:53.080]  And these talk show hosts, many of them were people that would attack me in the past.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.341]  And now they say, I guess you were right.
[00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:55.701]  What do we do?
[00:58:55.701 --> 00:58:57.342]  Because they realize they're not pet puppies.
[00:58:57.342 --> 00:59:00.524]  They're not part of the system.
[00:59:00.524 --> 00:59:02.285]  They realize that
[00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:05.472]  This is real.
[00:59:05.472 --> 00:59:06.513]  The New World Order is real.
[00:59:06.513 --> 00:59:07.453]  They are tyrannical.
[00:59:07.453 --> 00:59:09.274]  They are putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:59:09.274 --> 00:59:11.356]  You know, it's scary to admit all this.
[00:59:11.356 --> 00:59:12.957]  It's scary to face all of this.
[00:59:12.957 --> 00:59:17.099]  It's scary to deal with the New World Order onslaught.
[00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:22.242]  But it's more frightening to just crawl in a hole and hope that the wolves pass you by.
[00:59:22.242 --> 00:59:28.046]  No, let's stand on our own hind legs and let's meet the challenge.
[00:59:28.046 --> 00:59:29.727]  Today.
[00:59:29.727 --> 00:59:30.688]  We can't wait any longer.
[00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:41.568]  So get the word out, warn the people, go to every hill and mountain, let them know, the time to defend the Republic is here.
[00:59:41.568 --> 00:59:42.969]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.201]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:52.201 --> 00:59:56.945]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:56.945 --> 00:59:59.907]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:59.907 --> 01:00:02.949]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:07.673]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:08.133]  We're good.
[01:00:27.685 --> 01:00:33.950]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[01:00:39.694 --> 01:00:41.676]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.831]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:55.831 --> 01:01:05.237]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:05.237 --> 01:01:06.537]  Big Brother.
[01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:08.318]  Mainstream media.
[01:01:08.318 --> 01:01:10.079]  Government cover-ups.
[01:01:10.079 --> 01:01:11.660]  You want answers?
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.201]  Well, so does he.
[01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:17.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:17.384 --> 01:01:21.446]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:23.916 --> 01:01:34.407]  Alright, my friends, the Obama Deception will be released coming up March 15th at PrisonPlanet.tv and on DVD, exposing his real agenda to take action activists.
[01:01:34.407 --> 01:01:45.739]  We're joined for the next 20 minutes by Congressman Ron Paul, who's up there on the hill today, a very busy man, and everything he talked about for 30 years is unfortunately unfolding, so his credibility is at the gold standard.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:59.850]  Uh, right now, as the mainstream is forced to check in to the facts he's been laying out, I wanted to talk to him about the deepening depressionary system we're going into, what the Private Federal Reserve is up to in his bill to abolish it, how we can support that.
[01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.891]  Congressman, thank you for coming on.
[01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:02.411]  You're welcome.
[01:02:02.411 --> 01:02:03.852]  Good to be with you.
[01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:09.236]  Uh, every few weeks they come before the Banking Committee and you bring up the fact that what they're doing is destroying us.
[01:02:09.236 --> 01:02:12.999]  What do we need to do to bring the Private Federal Reserve under control?
[01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:16.274]  Well, it has to be an uprising by the people.
[01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:21.922]  There has to be enough people who will demand that their congressmen respond.
[01:02:21.922 --> 01:02:23.985]  And that is building.
[01:02:23.985 --> 01:02:28.953]  You know, a year ago or two, nobody in Washington even thought about the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:29.369 --> 01:02:35.495]  Today, there's a lot more thinking going on and a lot more support for our position, so it is growing.
[01:02:35.495 --> 01:02:39.618]  And yet, we're not on the verge of changing it.
[01:02:39.618 --> 01:02:49.047]  I have the bill to get rid of the Federal Reserve, that's the major step and the ultimate step, and they'll probably self-destruct before we actually pass legislation.
[01:02:49.047 --> 01:02:54.912]  But the bill that is more important in the short run is the auditing bill, the 1207 bill,
[01:02:56.232 --> 01:02:59.134]  Because that means they have to start answering our questions.
[01:02:59.134 --> 01:03:00.415]  Today they're protected.
[01:03:00.415 --> 01:03:03.878]  They're in total secrecy and they're protected by the law.
[01:03:03.878 --> 01:03:08.221]  If 1207 is passed, we have an audit and they have to answer the questions.
[01:03:08.221 --> 01:03:17.888]  And I figure if we ever get that far and get the exposure and get the transparency that we need, then people will wake up and realize why do we have them at all.
[01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:31.775]  Senator Sanders grilled him, as you know, last week, saying that he's supporting 1207, or a version in the Senate, because Bernanke, private Fed chief, just said, I'm not going to tell you where the money went, buddy.
[01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:37.956]  I mean, that's amazing to see our elected Congress, the most powerful branch of government, according to the founders, being told, kiss off.
[01:03:37.956 --> 01:03:38.817]  Right.
[01:03:38.817 --> 01:03:41.037]  And I know Sanders real well.
[01:03:41.037 --> 01:03:45.178]  He was on the banking committee with me before he went into the Senate, and I called him after that.
[01:03:46.019 --> 01:03:53.821]  And I believe he has now introduced my version of the transparency bill, and I've introduced his version.
[01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:55.281]  So both bills exist.
[01:03:55.281 --> 01:04:01.743]  Mine's a little bit more conclusive, and it removes the total authority for them to non-answer questions.
[01:04:01.743 --> 01:04:09.725]  His is specifically designed to answer certain questions and reveal where the trillion dollars went.
[01:04:09.725 --> 01:04:10.625]  They're very similar.
[01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:17.570]  But somewhat different in nature, so we both support each other's bill, and they've been introduced in both chambers.
[01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:27.313]  Well, public support for this, and the Congress itself, the majority are saying they're angry to not know where the money is, and Bloomberg sued to find out and has been told no on their foyer.
[01:04:27.313 --> 01:04:34.554]  I mean, if this gets media attention, I can see no way that Congress wouldn't vote for a proper audit of the private Federal Reserve.
[01:04:34.554 --> 01:04:38.475]  No, they're going to, if we can get it that far.
[01:04:39.259 --> 01:04:41.862]  And, you know, it's a good issue.
[01:04:41.862 --> 01:04:48.370]  Like so many of our issues, we bring different factions together, liberal and conservative, under the Constitution.
[01:04:48.911 --> 01:05:00.775]  Because if you're a good, honest liberal, like Bernie Sanders, he's an honest person, but he's very, very liberal and calls himself a socialist, but he agrees on the transparency issues.
[01:05:00.775 --> 01:05:11.519]  So this whole idea that we expose him should bring populists, libertarians, constitutionals, liberals, socialists, all together and say, you know, if we can't do this, what's left of representative government?
[01:05:11.519 --> 01:05:12.579]  There's nothing left.
[01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:13.680]  So it's a good unifier.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.620]  I think it's a great issue.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:26.287]  Bloomberg reports $9.7 trillion has disappeared in one form or another just out of the U.S., another $10 trillion globally, and now Larry Summers is saying they want more money?
[01:05:26.287 --> 01:05:29.288]  They want more unlimited cash?
[01:05:29.288 --> 01:05:30.009]  That's what they're doing.
[01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:31.029]  They keep coming back.
[01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:33.371]  You know, and what's the argument you hear up here?
[01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:40.335]  You hear this argument, which I know there's some disagreement even in our circles, this whole idea of earmarks.
[01:05:40.666 --> 01:05:42.827]  They're dealing with these 1% of earmarks.
[01:05:42.827 --> 01:05:45.809]  If you vote against them all, you don't cut one penny of spending.
[01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:47.811]  And they're talking about that endlessly.
[01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:51.493]  They're holding up the bill in the Congress over this so-called issue.
[01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:57.917]  At the same time, this number that you mentioned, the $9.7 trillion, we need to earmark every penny there.
[01:05:57.917 --> 01:05:59.699]  Stay there, stay there, Congressman, stay there.
[01:06:01.246 --> 01:06:04.750]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:10.156]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:06:10.156 --> 01:06:15.321]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:06:15.321 --> 01:06:16.743]  The KDF Dual Media
[01:06:16.783 --> 01:06:26.829]  KDF Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:32.613]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:38.877]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:06:38.877 --> 01:06:39.917]  What about you?
[01:06:39.917 --> 01:06:41.858]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:06:41.858 --> 01:06:44.560]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:07:01.072 --> 01:07:06.876]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:07:06.876 --> 01:07:13.881]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:07:14.446 --> 01:07:21.029]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:23.010]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:25.511]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:36.477]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:07:37.077 --> 01:07:38.758]  It's not about left or right.
[01:07:38.758 --> 01:07:40.619]  It's about a one world government.
[01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:47.524]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:57.370]  The Obama Deception.
[01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:58.551]  The people strike back.
[01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.793]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:08:03.793 --> 01:08:07.575]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:08:07.575 --> 01:08:13.880]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.983]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:08:18.503 --> 01:08:24.525]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:08:24.525 --> 01:08:27.946]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:08:27.946 --> 01:08:32.607]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:08:32.607 --> 01:08:38.829]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:43.810]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.691]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:08:50.606 --> 01:08:51.146]  Big Brother
[01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:08.638]  Mainstream media.
[01:09:08.638 --> 01:09:10.400]  Government cover-ups.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.983]  You want answers?
[01:09:11.983 --> 01:09:12.884]  Well, so does he.
[01:09:12.884 --> 01:09:17.731]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:21.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:09:23.195 --> 01:09:27.839]  Okay, Congressman, you had to take a hard break there for the satellites because it's syndicated.
[01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:29.200]  Sorry about interrupting you.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:38.646]  You were getting into the $9.7 trillion that's disappeared to a black hole, not $700 million, which they said was just a really big number they picked, and then you got cut off by the break.
[01:09:38.646 --> 01:09:39.747]  Go ahead.
[01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:50.335]  Yeah, I was talking about the need to monitor everything that we do and the transparency, and too often people concentrate on a non-issue, which is 1% of the budget, called earmarks,
[01:09:50.848 --> 01:09:54.250]  Even if you eliminated it, it wouldn't eliminate one penny.
[01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:57.552]  The real earmarks need to be done, you know, like, say, TARP funds.
[01:09:57.552 --> 01:10:04.996]  We gave the Treasury $350 billion, and then another $350 billion, and there are no instructions, no earmarks.
[01:10:04.996 --> 01:10:08.297]  The Congress needs to have more responsibility, more earmarks.
[01:10:08.297 --> 01:10:12.840]  Of course, all the spending should be voted down, but when they do spend, we ought to know where it's going.
[01:10:13.387 --> 01:10:18.169]  But the biggest, the largest amount, of course, is the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:19.950]  They're totally off-budget.
[01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.091]  They're like a government unto itself.
[01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:23.471]  They can create trillions.
[01:10:23.471 --> 01:10:27.133]  It's probably eight or nine, ten trillion dollars that they've been involved in.
[01:10:27.133 --> 01:10:30.834]  And they have no legal responsibility to answer any of our questions.
[01:10:30.834 --> 01:10:36.817]  And that, of course, is what Bernie Sanders and I have been working on, he in the Senate and me over in the House.
[01:10:37.287 --> 01:10:46.031]  To try to get legislation passed, and I think you've indicated that it ought to be a very popular thing to bring all these factions together and support our position.
[01:10:46.031 --> 01:10:53.434]  I can't imagine any American saying, well, yeah, create four or five hundred billion dollars or a couple trillion, and you have no responsibility.
[01:10:53.434 --> 01:10:56.316]  I think it should bring everybody together on this issue.
[01:10:56.316 --> 01:10:56.716]  And was that HR 207? 1207.
[01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:00.417]  Okay, HR 1207.
[01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:01.739]  Right.
[01:11:01.739 --> 01:11:03.622]  I didn't have the bill in front of me.
[01:11:03.622 --> 01:11:12.214]  And then I should have the Senate bill number, but somebody could find that rather easily because we want to help Sanders get support for his bill as well.
[01:11:12.214 --> 01:11:12.875]  Absolutely.
[01:11:12.875 --> 01:11:15.058]  In fact, I'll Google that and give that out after you leave us.
[01:11:16.957 --> 01:11:21.919]  Continuing with the economy, this is clearly entering depression level.
[01:11:21.919 --> 01:11:23.480]  The banks are doing what you said they would do.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.981]  They're hoarding the money, buying up other good banks.
[01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:31.463]  CBS reported $250 billion of bailout money has gone to the Caymans alone, the biggest names out there.
[01:11:33.064 --> 01:11:41.691]  Bernard Madoff is keeping a $60 million penthouse and mailing gold and diamonds out of the country to his family that's run to South America.
[01:11:41.691 --> 01:11:43.053]  He's the founder of the Nasdaq.
[01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:46.956]  It turns out all the other big banks are involved in similar Ponzi schemes.
[01:11:46.956 --> 01:11:55.183]  Shouldn't we be having criminal investigations of these people instead of the very same banksters now telling us we're going to have a new bank of the world that we pay carbon taxes to?
[01:11:55.183 --> 01:12:00.988]  Yeah, we should have minimal government, but even in a minimalist government, your government is supposed to
[01:12:01.588 --> 01:12:09.280]  Deal with theft and physical harm and fraud and that's what's going on and that's what they ignore or protect
[01:12:09.821 --> 01:12:10.141]  I don't know.
[01:12:35.516 --> 01:12:48.262]  When that company went bankrupt, it was a major event, and they claimed up here in Washington that the reason was that we needed even more regulation, we needed more SEC agents, and we needed more IRS agents.
[01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:52.604]  At the same time, he was convicted of fraud under Texas fraud law.
[01:12:52.604 --> 01:12:58.987]  He went to prison, and you know, and that thing was cleaned up, and the market wiped out the value of the company because it had no value.
[01:13:00.273 --> 01:13:08.975]  But what was our response in Congress was to pass Sarbanes-Oxley, more regulations which have actually contributed to some of the weakness in the economy.
[01:13:08.975 --> 01:13:19.858]  You just can't regulate away the mistakes that are made when governments are too much involved with community reinvestment acts and easy money that the Federal Reserve creates.
[01:13:19.858 --> 01:13:21.518]  Regulations cannot solve that problem.
[01:13:21.518 --> 01:13:27.640]  But your point, the purpose of the federal government should be, under these circumstances, to prosecute fraud.
[01:13:28.359 --> 01:13:33.460]  Well, take the Securities and Exchange Commission testifying before Congress, what, almost a month ago.
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:46.543]  They declared presidential prerogative and executive authority, I guess under national security, to not talk about why for nine years they were given private investigations detailing Bernie Madoff's crimes.
[01:13:46.543 --> 01:13:51.164]  And they kept saying to the Congress people, well, he hasn't been convicted, he hasn't pled guilty.
[01:13:51.164 --> 01:13:56.225]  And they said, it's not alleged, he's admitted to this.
[01:13:56.225 --> 01:13:56.665]  Yeah.
[01:13:58.004 --> 01:14:03.686]  You know, as bad as the executive branch is, so much of that responsibility falls on the Congress, too.
[01:14:03.686 --> 01:14:09.669]  I mean, we're so negligent to allow the executive branch to run roughshod over us.
[01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:17.352]  But if we had some people in the Congress that would have a little bit of courage, then they could deal with this and handle it.
[01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:26.396]  But no, if they spread national security interests, you know, whether it has to do with torture in secret prisons and prison camps and
[01:14:26.826 --> 01:14:28.507]  You know, all those kind of things.
[01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:29.647]  Oh, national security.
[01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:33.308]  We can't interfere with that.
[01:14:33.308 --> 01:14:36.329]  So therefore, the Congress says nothing.
[01:14:36.329 --> 01:14:49.253]  Specifically, sir, speaking of national security, Obama has said, Reuters headline, Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees under Bill of Rights, Constitution, or Geneva Convention.
[01:14:49.253 --> 01:14:51.814]  He's increasing the troops in Afghanistan.
[01:14:51.814 --> 01:14:54.335]  He's saying he's going to keep troops indefinitely, at least 50,000.
[01:14:55.935 --> 01:15:06.967]  In Iraq, going back on that promise, he's declaring a lot of executive privilege that he criticized under Bush, and he's expanding the NORTHCOM 20,000 troops to patrol America.
[01:15:06.967 --> 01:15:10.751]  He's creating this quasi-governmental usaservice.org.
[01:15:10.751 --> 01:15:13.695]  I mean, can you comment on those points of Obama?
[01:15:13.695 --> 01:15:17.399]  And many people are saying it looks like he may be worse than Bush on liberties.
[01:15:18.294 --> 01:15:27.783]  Yeah, and I don't hesitate to make that point, especially if I happen to get on a liberal station that might be sympathetic with some of my views, but they still like Obama, and they're still hopeful.
[01:15:27.783 --> 01:15:33.308]  In a few places, I keep my fingers crossed, and I say, I hope, you know, he does what he said he was going to do.
[01:15:33.308 --> 01:15:42.837]  But early on in Bush's administration, you know, he said we shouldn't be the policemen of the world, and we shouldn't be involved in nation-building like that bad guy Clinton.
[01:15:43.257 --> 01:15:44.998]  But then he went and did it even more so.
[01:15:44.998 --> 01:16:12.545]  I think your concerns are justified, because even though Obama was the so-called peace candidate, he was going to bring our troops home and end that war in Iraq, I'm afraid there's evidence now that shows that he's going to, you know, pursue the same foreign policy, which was my argument during the campaign, that no matter what happens, both major parties support the same foreign policy, the same monetary policy, the same welfare policy, and there's never really any change.
[01:16:13.058 --> 01:16:17.661]  In spite of that, I think it remains to be seen.
[01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:23.504]  Every once in a while you'll see an appointment, at least one or two appointments, that Obama has made.
[01:16:23.504 --> 01:16:30.328]  You're hopeful that they will become more concerned about our civil liberties, but I don't think there's any reason for us to rejoice.
[01:16:30.328 --> 01:16:40.914]  Well, I mean, he's bringing in all the very Clinton people who are the ones that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and others, the literal engineers of what's happening now with derivatives, and then they're up there grandstanding as our saviors.
[01:16:41.539 --> 01:16:51.303]  Yeah, and they're pursuing all the spending and the secret tough stuff going on, whether it's with Treasury or with the Reserve.
[01:16:51.303 --> 01:16:59.626]  And the markets, you know, in spite of how a lot of people think the markets don't know what's going on, the markets are pretty smart.
[01:16:59.626 --> 01:17:07.229]  So the fact that they're not responding, in spite of all this stuff the government is doing, every time the government comes up with a new program, the markets even go down more.
[01:17:08.342 --> 01:17:27.848]  So, the markets are saying that they're not very happy with the bailouts, not going to solve the problem, and the free market people are actually right, because you need liquidation, you need the elimination of the malinvestment, you need to get housing prices down so poor people can buy them and get rid of these 19 million empty houses.
[01:17:27.848 --> 01:17:34.310]  You can't stimulate housing until these houses are bought, and so far they haven't quite understood that.
[01:17:35.242 --> 01:17:40.364]  All right, Congressman, with the four or five minutes we've got left, I want to blitz through some quick questions for you.
[01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:43.125]  I know when you were on Glenn Beck, he says, I've been looking at these camps.
[01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.626]  Is there anything to it?
[01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:49.767]  We have the Houston Chronicle admitting they built FEMA camps.
[01:17:49.767 --> 01:17:56.170]  We have the bill introduced to build more and then merge the police and local communities in with them.
[01:17:56.690 --> 01:18:01.832]  They have signed Pentagon directives, as you know, to use regular army.
[01:18:01.832 --> 01:18:04.432]  In Canada, they're announcing they're going to use the military.
[01:18:04.432 --> 01:18:08.533]  The Army War College says the military is preparing to engage the American people.
[01:18:08.533 --> 01:18:13.255]  And I know you're informed, because I've never talked to you about something that you weren't informed about.
[01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:36.231]  And so, you know, you did say on the show, well, the public's worried because Washington's out of control, but when John Warner Defense Authorization Act and some of the new executive orders that have come out, but also just Pentagon directives, I could pull them up, they're saying governors will be dual-headed federal officers, and now they have Marines at checkpoints looking for drunk drivers, you know, in California.
[01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:42.516]  I mean, all of this is going on, sir, so can you specifically speak to the danger of NORTHCOM taking over, or is that not a problem?
[01:18:43.126 --> 01:18:47.149]  No, I think it definitely is a problem.
[01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:55.715]  And yet, on the bright side, if we're looking for one, as you know, we've had 20 states now introduce resolutions.
[01:18:55.715 --> 01:18:59.958]  They were sick of the fact that we might have to talk about state sovereignty again.
[01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:03.440]  So there's a healthy reaction to this.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.502]  But yes, we should be concerned.
[01:19:05.502 --> 01:19:11.626]  But because I deal with these people, although I know there's a lot of evil out there, I also know the average member of Congress
[01:19:12.116 --> 01:19:14.878]  Probably isn't a participant in a grand conspiracy.
[01:19:14.878 --> 01:19:21.783]  They'll come along and they say, well, all we're doing is, uh, states are inefficient and private sources don't work.
[01:19:21.783 --> 01:19:25.705]  We got to provide housing and the first housing is on a military base.
[01:19:25.705 --> 01:19:27.307]  That's all we're doing.
[01:19:27.307 --> 01:19:34.872]  And a lot of them will, they'll buy into this and they'll accept it even though others have other ideas on, on what's really going on.
[01:19:34.872 --> 01:19:37.934]  But the whole notion is so dangerous, even if it's all,
[01:19:38.904 --> 01:19:40.345]  Well, Congressman, you hit the nail!
[01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:56.892]  You hit the nail exactly on the head.
[01:19:56.892 --> 01:20:07.820]  They're rolling this out like, oh, there'll be emergency medical centers at military bases and a brig for bad people, and the Army's gonna have to maintain order when the government engineered this economic crisis.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.062]  Yeah, and a lot of people will buy into that.
[01:20:10.062 --> 01:20:15.826]  And then, too often in the past, what happens is it gets too far along and it's hard to reverse.
[01:20:15.826 --> 01:20:23.512]  But what we have to do is look on the bright side and say, well, we have to inform people to know what their rights are, know what the Constitution says, know what the states can do.
[01:20:24.207 --> 01:20:30.189]  And I'm delighted that a few states now are standing up, and they want to talk about nullification.
[01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:45.693]  You know, this is great stuff, and it's perfectly legal, and it's non-violent, it's constitutional, and if our numbers grow, we can do it non-violently, and hope that we don't get to that point where all the guns are pointed... some Americans are pointing guns at other Americans.
[01:20:45.693 --> 01:20:49.554]  That would, to me, be the worst thing that could happen.
[01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:52.115]  Congressman, in closing,
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.421]  What are other solutions?
[01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:56.062]  I mean, obviously, get behind the state's sovereignty.
[01:20:56.062 --> 01:20:57.283]  The state's created the feds.
[01:20:57.283 --> 01:20:59.724]  We can, you know, bring them to heel.
[01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:05.908]  Have grand juries move for indictments of these criminal bankers for all their racketeering and Ponzi schemes.
[01:21:05.908 --> 01:21:06.949]  That's solutions.
[01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.450]  What are some other solutions?
[01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:13.513]  And barring those solutions, how bad do you think the government's going to wreck the world economy?
[01:21:13.513 --> 01:21:14.794]  How bad do you think it's going to get?
[01:21:16.465 --> 01:21:20.388]  Well, I think it's going to be very, very prolonged.
[01:21:20.388 --> 01:21:22.209]  I don't see any rebound.
[01:21:22.209 --> 01:21:28.153]  Markets may come back up and that sort of thing, but to rebound, I would expect it to last every bit as long as
[01:21:28.692 --> 01:21:35.557]  It happened in the 30s, and the 30s actually ended up until after World War II, when finally the debt was liquidated.
[01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:44.884]  Then they, after World War II, they actually cut spending by two-thirds, and they cut taxes by one-third, and we went back to work again.
[01:21:44.884 --> 01:21:51.349]  So it's going to be a long, long time, but now I think we live in greater danger because people are more demanding.
[01:21:51.349 --> 01:21:57.934]  They believe they have a right to their neighbor's property, and that's why, you know, there's, you know, liable to be violent.
[01:21:59.365 --> 01:22:01.869]  I think we all have to be prepared.
[01:22:01.869 --> 01:22:03.792]  I think we should prepare our families.
[01:22:04.935 --> 01:22:08.118]  I think financially, ultimately, they're going to destroy the dollar.
[01:22:08.118 --> 01:22:18.826]  I don't see anything wrong with people believing in the Constitution and following what they thought should be legal tender and owning a few gold coins and a few silver coins and on how to defend themselves.
[01:22:18.826 --> 01:22:20.988]  That's what the founders talked about.
[01:22:20.988 --> 01:22:30.736]  But to me, the most important thing is that we invest in promoting the right ideas and promoting ideas of liberty and promoting the rule of law and promoting our Constitution.
[01:22:30.736 --> 01:22:33.899]  Because I've said so many times in the campaign that if we did that,
[01:22:34.304 --> 01:22:37.887]  Our problems would be solved rather quickly and non-violently.
[01:22:37.887 --> 01:22:38.808]  All right, you've got to go.
[01:22:38.808 --> 01:22:41.169]  I did have one question I forgot to ask.
[01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:41.670]  Iran.
[01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:45.053]  Israel is saying in their papers they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[01:22:45.053 --> 01:22:50.537]  Every strategist out there on the left and the right, you know, mainstream, says this could cause World War III.
[01:22:50.537 --> 01:22:57.222]  It will definitely cause major economic problems and Iran might actually launch real attacks.
[01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:59.364]  I mean, how serious of a situation is that?
[01:23:00.484 --> 01:23:08.413]  It is, and if we believe Obama, you know, he did make an outreach, was including the Iranians in some talks, and hopefully that is helpful.
[01:23:08.413 --> 01:23:17.804]  It also might be his cover to say that, okay, they came in and they didn't do what we said, so therefore we did our very best, and now we'll have to use some other tactics and maybe
[01:23:18.554 --> 01:23:21.897]  You know, I acknowledge what Israel might do.
[01:23:21.897 --> 01:23:23.498]  I have no idea what's going to happen.
[01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:32.866]  I think the fact that we talked a whole lot about that in the last two years of the Bush administration helped have him back off from doing anything, or Israel backing off.
[01:23:32.866 --> 01:23:39.431]  Right now, it's up for grabs, but I believe if that does happen, a lot of violence is going to break out.
[01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.894]  Look, there's more violence in Iraq now than there's been for a year.
[01:23:44.088 --> 01:23:53.462]  And also Afghanistan is exploding and we're bombing almost on a daily basis, a routine basis into Pakistan.
[01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:59.111]  And we're just looking to spread this war, which of course I consider the real threat to us all.
[01:23:59.551 --> 01:24:01.792]  Well, at the same time, you've been out there front and center.
[01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:04.034]  People now know the Alternative of Liberty.
[01:24:04.034 --> 01:24:09.017]  Folks can visit the Liberty Committee and get involved, or just Google the name Ron Paul.
[01:24:09.017 --> 01:24:13.900]  In closing, fire out a few of the key websites people can visit to get behind your bill to audit the Federal Reserve.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:21.705]  The best one is campaignforliberty.com, and you can go from there and support us on that issue, because the members of Congress and our Senators need to know.
[01:24:22.245 --> 01:24:24.307]  Congressman, we'll talk to you coming up in a month or so.
[01:24:24.307 --> 01:24:26.188]  God bless you and say hi to the family for me.
[01:24:26.188 --> 01:24:26.868]  Thank you very much.
[01:24:26.868 --> 01:24:27.269]  Bye-bye.
[01:24:27.269 --> 01:24:28.229]  All right, fantastic.
[01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:29.811]  There was Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:24:29.811 --> 01:24:33.213]  I skipped the network break, not the station break.
[01:24:33.213 --> 01:24:36.456]  Station break's coming up for everybody in about five minutes.
[01:24:36.456 --> 01:24:44.521]  And I skipped that network break so that everybody would have a chance to hear more from Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:24:45.522 --> 01:24:46.783]  And he's just doing a great job.
[01:24:46.783 --> 01:24:51.906]  I mean, he's introduced bills that have a good chance of passing if we get behind him to audit the criminals of the Federal Reserve.
[01:24:51.906 --> 01:24:57.450]  He said the criminal bankers need to be indicted by state grand juries and arrested.
[01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:59.451]  He's introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:24:59.451 --> 01:25:01.833]  It's up to like 70-something sponsors right now.
[01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.194]  He talked about 20-something states.
[01:25:03.194 --> 01:25:04.875]  It's more like 32 now.
[01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:06.796]  Introducing legislation, but he's always conservative.
[01:25:06.796 --> 01:25:08.737]  That's like a month-old number.
[01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:12.660]  I mean, it was just absolutely amazing interview with Congresswoman Ron Paul.
[01:25:13.362 --> 01:25:19.664]  But I'll tell you where the biggest solution is, and that is with you, the American people, look in the mirror.
[01:25:19.664 --> 01:25:30.388]  If you want the solution, then you need to simply look in the mirror and realize that we have to go out there and engage in the info war.
[01:25:30.388 --> 01:25:36.611]  We have to educate people one mind at a time, give them the red pill, wake them up in the matrix, and the Obama deception
[01:25:37.867 --> 01:25:48.814]  Comes out March 15th on DVD and at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality so you can download it, DivX, burn it to disk, give it to everybody you know.
[01:25:48.814 --> 01:25:51.096]  Don't stand by and wait for others to get it.
[01:25:51.969 --> 01:25:58.413]  Okay, and also by purchasing the high-quality DVD with a nice color cover and all the material, and it's got the extras on it.
[01:25:58.413 --> 01:26:00.375]  It's all at Prison Planet.
[01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:02.176]  That's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:26:02.176 --> 01:26:04.858]  You can watch it online coming up Sunday.
[01:26:04.858 --> 01:26:06.179]  I may even launch a few days early.
[01:26:06.179 --> 01:26:07.439]  Wink, wink.
[01:26:07.439 --> 01:26:11.882]  And you can also order the DVD right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:11.882 --> 01:26:18.627]  And because they're admitting millions of people signed up to Obama's USAService.org, and now what are they going to do?
[01:26:18.627 --> 01:26:21.509]  They're going to go knock on your door and quote, canvas and map
[01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:30.252]  Who supports Barack Obama and then try to intimidate you into going along with their agenda?
[01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:42.417]  And so what we need to do, is every time they come to your door, you need to counter it with the Obama deception, but more than that, go out, go to usaservice.org.
[01:26:42.417 --> 01:26:45.458]  Every small town, every big city has Obamanoid zombie meetings.
[01:26:46.482 --> 01:26:49.305]  This is like the early Nazi party, but they mean well.
[01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:52.829]  They think they're repudiating Bush, they don't know it's the same agenda on steroids.
[01:26:52.829 --> 01:27:04.221]  You need to reach out to them, you need to go to their meetings, and say, oh yeah, I'm against Bush, oh, all the secret arrests and the wars, but what about Obama?
[01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:06.184]  Check out this film, tell me what you think about it.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:07.960]  And they're real cult-like.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.222]  The leaders will try to kick you out, but some will notice and say, hey, that's wrong.
[01:27:11.222 --> 01:27:14.283]  And say, okay, well, come outside if you want me to give you DVDs.
[01:27:14.283 --> 01:27:18.625]  And then have a camera with you and it'll, you know, knowing them, I mean, they might start calling the cops.
[01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:19.085]  Get out of here!
[01:27:19.085 --> 01:27:19.825]  Get out of the library!
[01:27:19.825 --> 01:27:20.125]  Get out!
[01:27:20.125 --> 01:27:21.146]  You're like, well, I'm allowed to be here.
[01:27:21.146 --> 01:27:22.026]  I just came to your meeting.
[01:27:22.026 --> 01:27:23.967]  Because they'll act like you're a terrorist or something.
[01:27:23.967 --> 01:27:24.527]  How dare him!
[01:27:24.527 --> 01:27:25.607]  He's wanting to stop Obama!
[01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:25.828]  Lord!
[01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:28.028]  And then you can show that video of them flipping out.
[01:27:28.028 --> 01:27:31.050]  Then Obama supporters will see that online.
[01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:32.990]  And then they'll go watch the Obama deception.
[01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.891]  It's going to be everywhere for free.
[01:27:34.491 --> 01:27:38.734]  But you get it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv and the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:27:38.734 --> 01:27:40.475]  Folks, we're launching this sucker.
[01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:42.216]  I want you to go to Infowars.com.
[01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:52.522]  If you've got a bookstore, or a church, or a school, or, you know, a convenience store, a gas station, everything Obama sells, know that.
[01:27:52.522 --> 01:27:56.784]  Incredible hype out there, and so you've got the stack of them sitting there, and they're like, what are those?
[01:27:56.784 --> 01:27:59.086]  Oh, that's the Obama deception.
[01:27:59.086 --> 01:28:01.767]  That gets into how he's really working with Bush and others.
[01:28:01.767 --> 01:28:02.828]  Really, I want to see that.
[01:28:05.339 --> 01:28:11.443]  They put so much hype behind this guy that that's actually one of the scales missing on the dragon's belly.
[01:28:11.443 --> 01:28:14.324]  Where we can, uh, really give it to him.
[01:28:14.324 --> 01:28:17.906]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:28:17.906 --> 01:28:18.046]  888-253-3139.
[01:28:18.046 --> 01:28:22.469]  And we've got the film, I don't know, what is his lowest, $8 a piece when you buy them in bulk?
[01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:34.703]  I mean, folks, we just want to get the DVDs out, because that's the highest quality, the best people need to see.
[01:28:34.703 --> 01:28:41.867]  We want everyone to see this film, and we want it to go mega viral, with the premiere coming up this Sunday night, 6 p.m.
[01:28:41.867 --> 01:28:44.448]  at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:44.448 --> 01:28:47.069]  We are only talking about four and a half, five days away.
[01:28:47.069 --> 01:28:49.831]  Let me see the, yeah, five days away.
[01:28:49.831 --> 01:28:53.473]  Since it's halfway into Sunday, it'll actually, it's about four and a half days away.
[01:28:53.473 --> 01:28:55.594]  We are so excited about this.
[01:28:56.704 --> 01:29:01.149]  This is so exciting what's going on and happening, because you heard Ron Paul.
[01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:02.030]  He'll tell it like it is.
[01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:04.272]  He said people are waking up everywhere.
[01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:10.439]  People are waking up in droves to the FEMA camps, to the New World Order, to the troops on the streets.
[01:29:10.439 --> 01:29:16.925]  The liberals are starting to get concerned and they're hoping Obama... I mean, I'm talking a lot of Obamanoids and they're kind of coming out of their
[01:29:17.987 --> 01:29:27.572]  They're mind-controlled from, he's the messiah, he'll fix everything, oh I love him to... I know he's doing a lot of bad stuff, man, I just hope he's for real, man, because we're in trouble.
[01:29:27.572 --> 01:29:32.514]  See, see, they blow out the economy, tell you we're going into depression, and say, oh, but this guy'll fix it right on time.
[01:29:32.514 --> 01:29:34.435]  And then he comes in and it just gets worse and worse.
[01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:38.357]  I mean, since he's been in office, the stock market's dropped by 3,000 points.
[01:29:40.285 --> 01:29:41.746]  And I'm not blaming Obama!
[01:29:41.746 --> 01:29:42.746]  He's a puppet!
[01:29:42.746 --> 01:29:45.147]  You know, in the end, they're going to destroy him one way or the other politically.
[01:29:45.147 --> 01:29:48.508]  They're going to blame everything on him, just like they blamed everything on Bush.
[01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:53.330]  Let's get past Obama to the bankers, to the New World Order, and that's what the film says in the first five minutes.
[01:29:53.330 --> 01:30:03.033]  But then we go, hey, but if you don't believe us, we're going to go through his lies, and then we're going to go through his real agenda, currently, and what he's really done, and then what his future plans are.
[01:30:04.568 --> 01:30:07.590]  This film was just finished a week ago.
[01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:09.852]  This film was finished a week ago.
[01:30:09.852 --> 01:30:11.413]  It is one of the most up-to-date things.
[01:30:11.413 --> 01:30:15.735]  I mean, you talk about, you know, if the film's done, it comes out a week and a half after you finish it.
[01:30:15.735 --> 01:30:16.116]  Boom!
[01:30:17.611 --> 01:30:18.812]  And we haven't been sleeping.
[01:30:18.812 --> 01:30:22.535]  You know, I said I was going to rush and make this film, but I couldn't lower my quality.
[01:30:22.535 --> 01:30:29.220]  In fact, we shot up to a new level of quality, and in the graphics, in the 3D animations, it's just unbelievable.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:32.903]  TheObamaDeception.net, ObamaDeception.net, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.

[01:30:51.283 --> 01:30:52.684]  We're on the march.
[01:30:52.684 --> 01:30:55.205]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:55.205 --> 01:31:05.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:05.269 --> 01:31:06.450]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[01:31:06.846 --> 01:31:11.787]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[01:31:11.787 --> 01:31:18.008]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[01:31:18.008 --> 01:31:20.649]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[01:31:20.649 --> 01:31:23.630]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:28.171]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:29.211]  Not.
[01:31:29.211 --> 01:31:29.871]  Get the tea.
[01:31:30.549 --> 01:31:33.991]  Change your body and life from unhealthy to healthy.

[01:31:43.135 --> 01:31:44.316]  The tea that changes how you feel.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:07.248]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:07.248 --> 01:32:14.257]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:32:14.818 --> 01:32:21.402]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:23.384]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:32:23.384 --> 01:32:25.885]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:32:25.885 --> 01:32:36.853]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:32:37.452 --> 01:32:39.113]  It's not about left or right.
[01:32:39.113 --> 01:32:40.994]  It's about a one world government.
[01:32:40.994 --> 01:32:47.899]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:33:56.812 --> 01:34:10.740]  There must be some kind of way out of here, said the Joker to the feet.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:16.244]  There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
[01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:21.953]  I was doing an imitation of Bob Dylan doing this.
[01:34:21.953 --> 01:34:25.777]  This, of course, is the one and only Jimi Hendrix.
[01:34:41.039 --> 01:34:51.021]  You know, there are many here that think that life is but a joke.
[01:34:51.021 --> 01:34:59.083]  But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our game.
[01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:02.183]  So let us stop talking foolishly now.
[01:35:02.183 --> 01:35:06.304]  The hour is getting late.
[01:35:06.304 --> 01:35:09.785]  Charles, Larry, Fred, Brian, Joe, and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:14.765]  We think of life.
[01:35:14.765 --> 01:35:17.066]  Yeah, that's the yuppies.
[01:35:17.066 --> 01:35:19.408]  And this is not our fate.
[01:35:19.408 --> 01:35:21.589]  The hour's getting late.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:43.822]  You see the riders approaching?
[01:35:43.822 --> 01:35:48.226]  Oh, you got the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth for months here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:48.226 --> 01:35:54.691]  That's all you got from all the other great patriots out there fighting the new world order.
[01:35:54.691 --> 01:35:55.792]  Do I do a perfect job?
[01:35:55.792 --> 01:35:57.073]  No.
[01:35:57.073 --> 01:36:00.636]  Hell, I'm silly and ignorant sometimes, but I got guts.
[01:36:00.636 --> 01:36:02.657]  And guts is enough.
[01:36:02.657 --> 01:36:04.559]  What about you?
[01:36:04.559 --> 01:36:06.380]  One life to live.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:06.961]  Make the choice.
[01:36:08.706 --> 01:36:11.527]  Join this historic battle against tyranny.
[01:36:11.527 --> 01:36:13.868]  And come in for the big win.
[01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:24.893]  Look at this news I've got here.
[01:36:24.893 --> 01:36:28.075]  Lawyers seek global forum to handle Madoff cases.
[01:36:28.075 --> 01:36:31.917]  Seek a global government, a global bank, and they will try their own people.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.942]  And so he knows where all the bodies are buried.
[01:36:34.942 --> 01:36:44.451]  So that's why the Associated Press yesterday said he may not even get one day of prison time for stealing between 50 and 100 billion dollars.
[01:36:44.451 --> 01:36:46.634]  Is that not open crime?
[01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:48.435]  Open evil?
[01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:48.575]  Ah!
[01:36:48.575 --> 01:36:50.537]  Outside in the cold distance!
[01:37:01.721 --> 01:37:03.062]  They're foot servants, too.
[01:37:03.062 --> 01:37:04.163]  The Wildcat.
[01:37:04.163 --> 01:37:06.824]  The enemy is approaching.
[01:37:26.357 --> 01:37:32.519]  Alright, I'm going to spend five minutes with Jason Bermas for a quick retraction and then a beef-up.
[01:37:32.519 --> 01:37:44.964]  Now, I made it clear on air yesterday that Mr. Moore, who wrote the Watchmen novel, that I'm not a comic book reader, and so I just got the book Sunday, scanned through it after I'd seen the film Saturday.
[01:37:44.964 --> 01:37:49.626]  The whole film was, the Illuminati, the Pyramid Corporation, is staging terror attacks for your own good.
[01:37:49.626 --> 01:37:55.308]  It's a wonderful thing to bring in an age of love and peace and the new God-man that will develop and travel the stars.
[01:37:56.488 --> 01:38:00.250]  And then Burmas said, oh yeah, he was also involved in that Sandman thing.
[01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:04.052]  So I mentioned that, and then people emailed me and drove saying, no he's not!
[01:38:04.052 --> 01:38:21.783]  Burmas, to clarify, there was a collaboration between the Sandman and another novel, that's why Alan Moore's always getting mad because they twist his stuff, but you did pull up some of the, and since then we've done research, the guy openly is a mason, he openly says he's into the occult, he openly says he does all this, regardless, you see the film,
[01:38:22.683 --> 01:38:24.905]  They staged terror attacks to bring in world peace.
[01:38:24.905 --> 01:38:27.967]  I mean, that's the whole point we're making about the Watchmen.
[01:38:27.967 --> 01:38:33.150]  Then we're going to briefly talk about Bernie Madoff, and then we're going to go to your phone calls for those patiently holding.
[01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:33.691]  Burmess?
[01:38:33.691 --> 01:38:36.773]  Alright, so he revived the John Constantine character.
[01:38:36.773 --> 01:38:39.475]  They just had Keanu Reeves do a movie about that about five years ago.
[01:38:39.815 --> 01:38:42.796]  That's where I got it confused because Hellblazer became a series.
[01:38:42.796 --> 01:38:45.656]  It was in the same vertigo line as Neil Gaiman's Sandman.
[01:38:45.656 --> 01:38:47.917]  But he also did From Hell.
[01:38:47.917 --> 01:38:51.957]  And From Hell was all about Jack the Ripper doing ritualistic mason killings.
[01:38:51.957 --> 01:38:52.938]  They made a movie about it.
[01:38:52.938 --> 01:38:55.758]  But people say that's exposing what they're doing.
[01:38:55.758 --> 01:39:02.380]  Neil, my whole point is, you know, I watched that film in the RV driving to the Denver DNC.
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:03.380]  We watched that and
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:04.820]  I don't
[01:39:22.715 --> 01:39:27.677]  That in the film, the Pyramid Corporation runs the planet and stages terror attacks to bring the world together.
[01:39:27.677 --> 01:39:30.158]  That's the issue, and it's all Illuminati symbolism.
[01:39:30.158 --> 01:39:31.559]  That's the point we're making.
[01:39:31.559 --> 01:39:36.581]  So clearly, from hell could have a positive message, but the Watchman does not.
[01:39:36.581 --> 01:39:39.062]  It's a very wicked Illuminati... I mean, this is their philosophy.
[01:39:39.062 --> 01:39:46.465]  Well, he did V for Vendetta, too, but he's also a practicing magician, and he actually worships a Roman snake deity named... I think it's...
[01:39:47.045 --> 01:39:48.626]  That's what their real religion is.
[01:39:48.626 --> 01:39:50.266]  Numbers, symbols to manipulate our subconscious.
[01:40:02.952 --> 01:40:04.592]  Yeah, so he's into that, openly.
[01:40:04.592 --> 01:40:12.475]  I mean, he's got, you know, a wife, a girlfriend, just see how the guy looks and dresses, you can tell right away that he's into this, you know, supernatural realm.
[01:40:12.475 --> 01:40:17.416]  So, I would say people need to be very careful about, you know, Alan Moore worship.
[01:40:17.416 --> 01:40:21.257]  He also did a Spawn comic back in the day, which was all about the different levels of hell.
[01:40:21.877 --> 01:40:25.540]  You know, so he's very into, you know, this kind of occultic culture.
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.282]  So, again, people should be very wary of this film.
[01:40:28.282 --> 01:40:32.885]  Well, regardless, I saw the movie and I've now scanned through the novel and it's the same.
[01:40:32.885 --> 01:40:36.608]  They stage terror attacks to bring in the one world government.
[01:40:36.608 --> 01:40:38.069]  And killing millions of people is good.
[01:40:38.789 --> 01:41:01.583]  Okay, and at the end of the movie, the good guys have staged a terror attack, and you learn that, and then they show a perfect, you know, the dugout hole, six months after 9-11, with the big American flags hanging, it's at ground zero, they literally rotoscoped ground zero, and put the same flyers and same signs up of we'll never forget, and it shows the firemen and everything, and they say, we did this to you for your own good.
[01:41:01.583 --> 01:41:03.804]  I mean, this is a disgusting thing they've done.
[01:41:03.804 --> 01:41:04.064]  Yeah.
[01:41:04.064 --> 01:41:05.645]  They're just throwing it in our face.
[01:41:05.645 --> 01:41:06.846]  As they often do, Alex.
[01:41:06.846 --> 01:41:08.307]  We did it because we love you, Jason.
[01:41:08.407 --> 01:41:11.188]  Well, that's why we're going to get a World Bank for Bernie Madoff.
[01:41:11.188 --> 01:41:12.329]  We need to prosecute.
[01:41:12.329 --> 01:41:13.289]  We need to prosecute.
[01:41:13.289 --> 01:41:13.850]  This is out of order.
[01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:14.890]  Go ahead and tell folks.
[01:41:14.890 --> 01:41:17.051]  Yeah, you know, I reported on this last night.
[01:41:17.051 --> 01:41:21.813]  I actually wrote a little blog about it already over at the new little blog spot, infowarrior.infowars.com.
[01:41:21.813 --> 01:41:22.734]  Yeah, give that out again.
[01:41:22.734 --> 01:41:23.914]  Is that linked on the main page yet?
[01:41:23.914 --> 01:41:26.556]  I don't know if it is, but it's infowarrior.infowars.com.
[01:41:26.556 --> 01:41:28.276]  It's a subpage of InfoWars.
[01:41:28.276 --> 01:41:32.458]  And basically what they're doing, and everybody was always asking me, Alex, well why are they throwing this guy to the wolves?
[01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:33.739]  And I would always say, well, number one,
[01:41:34.139 --> 01:41:35.200]  It's 50 billion dollars.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.042]  In the grand scheme of things, these guys are now stealing and looting trillions in front of you.
[01:41:39.042 --> 01:41:43.244]  Some of the smaller banks are giving back the TARP money because they don't want to be swallowed up by this whole thing.
[01:41:43.244 --> 01:41:46.746]  Alright, now you have to prosecute Bernie Madoff in a public forum.
[01:41:46.746 --> 01:41:51.368]  So what they're saying they need to do is create this new world banking court.
[01:41:51.368 --> 01:41:53.609]  In other words, it's a new world court system.
[01:41:53.609 --> 01:41:56.971]  And then they will try their competition and basically... No, no, that's what they've said!
[01:41:57.071 --> 01:42:08.834]  It's a new bank of the world that will set currency rates and interest rates worldwide, and then they will run around prosecuting the sub-minions and selling world government in the new regulatory system to stop the bankers.
[01:42:08.834 --> 01:42:16.457]  Exactly, and they will be consolidating power even further, and this is going to be a huge show trial to bring in this court system and its legitimacy, Alex.
[01:42:16.457 --> 01:42:17.337]  It's very frightening.
[01:42:17.597 --> 01:42:18.017]  That's right.
[01:42:18.017 --> 01:42:21.339]  Madoff's already apologizing and saying, yes, we need the new Bank of the World.
[01:42:21.339 --> 01:42:21.980]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:25.882]  And he'll agree that he was bad and you did this all by yourself.
[01:42:25.882 --> 01:42:27.883]  Meanwhile, he's involved with all the other big banks.
[01:42:27.883 --> 01:42:29.204]  They've declared nationals.
[01:42:29.204 --> 01:42:30.285]  These guys are bold, man.
[01:42:30.285 --> 01:42:35.028]  The very criminals that run it all are now posing saying they'll have a world court that will save us.
[01:42:35.028 --> 01:42:36.929]  Yeah, a world banking court.
[01:42:36.929 --> 01:42:43.933]  I mean, literally, it's going to be like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers at the head of this thing or controlling the puppets that are publicly at the head.
[01:42:44.153 --> 01:42:50.379]  And they're going to go loot all the pension funds and people that have hidden money offshore in their own small bank accounts in the Caymans and in Switzerland.
[01:42:50.379 --> 01:42:50.959]  That's already happening.
[01:42:50.959 --> 01:42:55.003]  They're going to go after anybody who doesn't play ball with this world banking system.
[01:42:55.003 --> 01:43:00.027]  Oh yeah, well listen, tyranny is always about the ultra-elite rich robbing the rich.
[01:43:00.027 --> 01:43:02.370]  And they're going to have an army of the poor people like...
[01:43:03.783 --> 01:43:05.624]  Exactly, and we're going to be squeezed so hard.
[01:43:05.624 --> 01:43:17.589]  Again, Gordon Brown gets up in front of Congress, Alex, and he's like, we're going to have the biggest middle class of the world ever in the next ten years because all those third world people that are making our stuff now are going to become consumers.
[01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:27.473]  Meanwhile, what's really happening is all the middle class is being decimated and killed and the gap between the middle class... And now the middle class can't buy the African and Latin American and Asian goods and they're in free fall implosion.
[01:43:27.473 --> 01:43:27.853]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:28.453 --> 01:43:29.594]  Basically, they're widening the gap.
[01:43:29.594 --> 01:43:31.275]  And then we hear, oh, we've got aid for the third world.
[01:43:31.275 --> 01:43:33.536]  That's going in and buying off more of their politicians with our money.
[01:43:33.536 --> 01:43:34.276]  Yeah.
[01:43:34.276 --> 01:43:39.579]  And more of their infrastructure, because they plan on actually... No, I mean, people always gripe about, I'm sick of foreign aid, I'm sick of helping.
[01:43:39.579 --> 01:43:41.060]  They're not helping those countries.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:45.062]  They take our money and buy off the infrastructure and then give it to the private banks publicly.
[01:43:45.162 --> 01:43:47.644]  Yeah, it's another type of corporate welfare, really.
[01:43:47.644 --> 01:43:51.427]  It's a type of... What is is economic warfare against the entire planet.
[01:43:51.427 --> 01:44:00.994]  Jason, you are live on the internet streams at InfoWars.com on the new Star Guide feed that's listed up at GCNlive.com and on a new 24-hour GCN feed.

[01:44:20.526 --> 01:44:23.467]  All the same guests and other guests you hear on this show are on the air.
[01:44:23.467 --> 01:44:31.430]  You know, Alan Watt, and Webster Tarpley, and Ron Paul, and Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, and they're all going on there, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:32.311]  Jason, good to have you in here.
[01:44:32.311 --> 01:44:33.171]  Thanks so much.
[01:44:33.171 --> 01:44:33.511]  You bet.
[01:44:33.511 --> 01:44:37.733]  Okay, we're going to go ahead now and shut off this mic, and I am going to go to some phone calls.
[01:44:37.733 --> 01:44:40.314]  Charles in Louisiana, my brother.
[01:44:40.314 --> 01:44:41.515]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:44:41.835 --> 01:44:44.397]  Oh yeah, I listen to you every day, but I gotta listen to you at night.
[01:44:44.397 --> 01:44:47.039]  I can't hardly get you doing a day.
[01:44:47.039 --> 01:44:48.521]  But I'm still with you.
[01:44:48.521 --> 01:44:53.685]  I don't make too many tapes, because you left the storm to kind of financially rank me.
[01:44:53.685 --> 01:44:56.967]  You've made tens of thousands of copies of my films, yes.
[01:44:56.967 --> 01:44:58.809]  I'm asking people to get these tapes.
[01:44:58.809 --> 01:45:00.751]  Now is the time to do it.
[01:45:00.751 --> 01:45:05.274]  When I was passing the tapes out, it wasn't hot like it is right now.
[01:45:05.274 --> 01:45:09.598]  And one person, one person, just with a few hundred tapes,
[01:45:10.765 --> 01:45:15.088]  We've got to get outside the choir, and what, for 10 years you've handed out more than 6,000 of my films?
[01:45:36.607 --> 01:45:46.212]  And tell folks, now again, you planted the seeds, now people will see it's true, but even when this wasn't the hottest issue and folks waking up to world government, you told me that police were buying you coffee and asking for more money.
[01:45:46.212 --> 01:45:48.433]  Oh yeah, well first they wanted to put me in jail, remember?
[01:45:48.433 --> 01:45:52.415]  They wanted to take my dog away from me, and they were giving me a hard time.
[01:45:52.415 --> 01:46:01.180]  But after a while, one cop that gave me a hard time, he brought me coffee, I've been over his house five or six times, his wife even ran some tapes off of me.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.961]  And he was against me, he was really bitter
[01:46:03.433 --> 01:46:04.273]  How did he wake up?
[01:46:04.273 --> 01:46:05.114]  What was the process?
[01:46:05.114 --> 01:46:10.976]  Because you were out handing them out on street corners, and they said you don't have a permit, and they tried to... You know, it's given a little flare.
[01:46:10.976 --> 01:46:12.816]  It was Larry Nichols back then, you know?
[01:46:12.816 --> 01:46:13.557]  Yeah.
[01:46:13.557 --> 01:46:21.280]  And so he started picking on me then, and then I gave a tape to, I think it was his aunt.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.741]  His aunt showed him a tape, and he come and apologized to me.
[01:46:24.741 --> 01:46:29.042]  And then he gave me some money for some more tapes.
[01:46:29.042 --> 01:46:30.303]  He wanted five copies of
[01:46:30.936 --> 01:46:33.877]  Dark Secret of Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:33.877 --> 01:46:35.718]  And I told him, I said, no money, no charge.
[01:46:35.718 --> 01:46:37.298]  And we just started being friends.
[01:46:37.298 --> 01:46:42.560]  I went over to his house to eat, and met his wife and his kids, and she started running the stakes off of me for a while.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.361]  And then you moved, right?
[01:46:44.361 --> 01:46:45.921]  Yes, then I moved, yes.
[01:46:45.921 --> 01:46:48.122]  But I mean, I see him every now and then.
[01:46:48.122 --> 01:46:50.163]  But I've been down to the courthouse.
[01:46:50.163 --> 01:46:55.405]  I give Willie Graves, Jack McLean's Vampire 2000.
[01:46:57.124 --> 01:47:08.307]  I'll tell you the truth, people just started buying me coffee, leaving me tapes in my mailbox, you know, extra discs.
[01:47:08.307 --> 01:47:09.487]  It really made me feel good.
[01:47:09.487 --> 01:47:15.029]  I really felt I made a difference and I'm nobody and I made a difference, you know?
[01:47:15.029 --> 01:47:20.510]  And I told my story on air quite a few times about what the police did to me and a lot of them apologized to me.
[01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:22.330]  They didn't have nothing to do with it.
[01:47:22.330 --> 01:47:24.311]  But the truth makes people act different.
[01:47:25.134 --> 01:47:31.988]  The truth makes people become alive and you can do that just by talking to people, giving them news articles.
[01:47:32.389 --> 01:47:35.970]  And a couple of tapes, and them tapes will go to other places.
[01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:42.151]  Well, when I talk to folks exactly like Pays It Forward, it just spreads, uh, you know, virally, but in a good way.
[01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:51.854]  So many people I talk to in special forces or government who've seen a lot of this, they go, nothing made sense till I saw this, and then I checked out your claims and now everything makes sense.
[01:47:51.854 --> 01:47:57.515]  What they're being told doesn't make sense because they're being lied to, but they see this and then it all makes sense.
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:14.785]  Yes, I've got one book somebody sent me, and I don't know if you mentioned it, it's about Social Security, and I give it to right now, I've got some people come back from the military, and I've given it to them, they're passing it around, and I'm telling the truth, a little bit of knowledge.
[01:48:14.785 --> 01:48:17.866]  People are hungry, Mr. Jones, for the truth.
[01:48:17.866 --> 01:48:20.967]  People are hungry, and I want to tell you something.
[01:48:20.967 --> 01:48:25.568]  People say, oh, you praise Al, but I do praise you because you help me wake up.
[01:48:26.141 --> 01:48:31.003]  You helped my whole parish wake up, just with a few tapes.
[01:48:31.003 --> 01:48:33.344]  And I can't thank you enough, you know?
[01:48:33.344 --> 01:48:34.524]  I can't thank you?
[01:48:34.524 --> 01:48:35.705]  Listen, we're all together, man.
[01:48:35.705 --> 01:48:37.246]  If they win, we're going to be total slaves.
[01:48:37.246 --> 01:48:40.447]  Well, this year, something very bad is going to happen.
[01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:42.748]  I believe there's going to be a food shortage.
[01:48:42.748 --> 01:48:44.349]  I believe people need to get British burgers.
[01:48:44.349 --> 01:48:45.829]  I think they're going to stage terror attacks.
[01:48:45.829 --> 01:48:47.190]  I can just feel it in my gut.
[01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:49.291]  And I just talked to Miss Debra the other day.
[01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:51.351]  I'm getting some new filters today.
[01:48:51.351 --> 01:48:54.053]  And please, people, get these tapes.
[01:48:54.053 --> 01:48:55.113]  And I promise you,
[01:48:55.663 --> 01:48:57.344]  Don't argue with your family.
[01:48:57.344 --> 01:48:59.525]  Just give them the tapes, and they will wake up.
[01:48:59.525 --> 01:49:02.186]  You'll plant the seed, and we can all be one.
[01:49:02.186 --> 01:49:04.627]  If we think the same way, we can all be one.
[01:49:04.627 --> 01:49:08.429]  I have lost so much faith in the American people for being so ignorant.
[01:49:08.429 --> 01:49:13.951]  I have quit one time because I was so sick of the American people being so cowardly.
[01:49:13.951 --> 01:49:18.293]  But what makes them cowardly, they don't know the truth, and they get confused, and they run from it.
[01:49:18.293 --> 01:49:21.374]  But these tapes put it all together.
[01:49:21.374 --> 01:49:22.155]  It's documented.
[01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:24.916]  I gave it to the lawyers, and lawyers checked it out.
[01:49:25.816 --> 01:49:27.577]  And said, man, I can't find no fault in it.
[01:49:27.577 --> 01:49:29.018]  It's all true.
[01:49:29.018 --> 01:49:32.240]  I gave it, I gave it to the fireman, policeman.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.321]  I sent one to a blank or a governor.
[01:49:35.321 --> 01:49:41.244]  Right now, Django don't want to take the bailout money from, uh, he's been on national news.
[01:49:41.244 --> 01:49:43.366]  Louisiana don't want it to take the bailout money.
[01:49:43.366 --> 01:49:47.448]  And I hope to God I hear some part of that with these tapes.
[01:49:47.448 --> 01:49:48.428]  I went to the Capitol.
[01:49:48.428 --> 01:49:53.051]  I couldn't get in, but I gave them to all, all, uh, bodyguards of the governors and all that.
[01:49:54.103 --> 01:49:56.045]  I put them on cause.
[01:49:56.045 --> 01:49:57.686]  I've been run out of restrooms with it.
[01:49:57.686 --> 01:49:59.788]  I've been run out of donut shops.
[01:49:59.788 --> 01:50:01.869]  But now I can go back in and hold my head up.
[01:50:01.869 --> 01:50:04.191]  Because if I go to someone, I don't even pay for coffee.
[01:50:04.191 --> 01:50:05.652]  Thank you for telling me the truth.
[01:50:05.652 --> 01:50:06.873]  Thank you for the tapes.
[01:50:06.873 --> 01:50:07.954]  Can you make one for my mother?
[01:50:07.954 --> 01:50:09.695]  I had police stop me.
[01:50:09.695 --> 01:50:10.836]  I thought I was getting tickets.
[01:50:10.836 --> 01:50:12.738]  Can you get any tapes on you, Charlie?
[01:50:12.738 --> 01:50:14.419]  I said, yeah, give me a name.
[01:50:14.419 --> 01:50:16.100]  I'll pass by my house.
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:18.562]  I'll have you some tapes tomorrow.
[01:50:18.562 --> 01:50:20.824]  It woke up, a whole world woke up at me.
[01:50:21.178 --> 01:50:22.039]  And I was nobody.
[01:50:22.039 --> 01:50:23.661]  I was just a guy that had come out of prison.
[01:50:23.661 --> 01:50:28.166]  I was so mentally torn down and didn't know which way to go.
[01:50:28.166 --> 01:50:29.567]  I needed a reason to live.
[01:50:29.567 --> 01:50:33.491]  And I caught you by accident and I got your first tape, Police 2000.
[01:50:34.525 --> 01:50:36.526]  And ever since then, my whole life changed.
[01:50:36.526 --> 01:50:39.447]  My life changed by trying to help out my country.
[01:50:39.447 --> 01:50:40.687]  No, that's the point.
[01:50:40.687 --> 01:50:43.468]  When you help people, you get blessed.
[01:50:43.468 --> 01:50:44.988]  And you don't do it to get blessed.
[01:50:44.988 --> 01:50:47.749]  You get through your fear, you do it, and it just gets better and better.
[01:50:47.749 --> 01:50:50.610]  And even when you're persecuted, it's a blessing.
[01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:51.691]  I don't know how to explain it.
[01:50:51.691 --> 01:50:52.951]  The Bible is true.
[01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:56.152]  Listen, God bless you, my friend Charles, and it was good talking to you.
[01:50:56.152 --> 01:50:57.893]  And take care of yourself.
[01:50:57.893 --> 01:50:58.713]  God bless you, sir.
[01:50:59.218 --> 01:51:00.639]  Say hi to your wife for me.
[01:51:00.639 --> 01:51:02.680]  Yeah, just an amazing story.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.901]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:51:04.901 --> 01:51:07.883]  We'll have to hold the next guest up because I want to go to all these people I said I would.
[01:51:07.883 --> 01:51:09.264]  Larry, Fred, Brian, and Joel.
[01:51:09.264 --> 01:51:11.425]  I'm going to come back to each one of you when we get back.
[01:51:11.425 --> 01:51:13.686]  We'll have the guest on at the 8 after, but I'll keep taking your calls then.
[01:51:13.686 --> 01:51:14.427]  This is another guest.
[01:51:15.387 --> 01:51:18.429]  Because the Border Patrol has a tough job and we support them.
[01:51:18.429 --> 01:51:27.656]  But they harass citizens, it even happens here in Texas, and they're using it as internal checkpoints a hundred miles in to just stop everybody.
[01:51:27.656 --> 01:51:28.637]  And that's wrong, folks.
[01:51:28.637 --> 01:51:30.858]  You can spot the illegal aliens, you know, if you're blind.
[01:51:30.858 --> 01:51:32.459]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:51:32.459 --> 01:51:36.422]  It needs to be enforced at the business level, and throw the buck at these businesses.
[01:51:36.422 --> 01:51:43.627]  But the point is, is that he's standing up to what they're doing, and if more people do this, it'll reform these internal checkpoints.
[01:51:44.568 --> 01:51:47.392]  I mean, take the banker bailout money and now the stimulus package.
[01:51:47.392 --> 01:51:53.201]  Illegal aliens are exempt when they get the bailout money from having to show documentation, but citizens have to.
[01:51:53.201 --> 01:51:55.144]  That's what we're talking about here.
[01:51:55.144 --> 01:51:58.309]  Meanwhile, they throw Ramos and Campion in prison for no reason.
[01:52:00.842 --> 01:52:04.305]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[01:52:04.305 --> 01:52:07.528]  Do you really want to find out and gamble with your family's lives?
[01:52:07.528 --> 01:52:10.170]  Order a one-year supply that will feed four to five people for only $39.95.
[01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:13.693]  That's right, a one-year supply for under $4,000 from YourFoodStorage.com.

[01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:31.632]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:52:31.632 --> 01:52:36.156]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[01:52:36.156 --> 01:52:39.718]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of the International Forecast.
[01:52:39.798 --> 01:52:43.699]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:12.950]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:19.451]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:53:19.451 --> 01:53:21.412]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:53:21.412 --> 01:53:23.872]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:53:23.872 --> 01:53:34.774]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:53:37.077 --> 01:53:38.737]  It's not about left or right.
[01:53:38.737 --> 01:53:40.598]  It's about a one world government.
[01:53:40.598 --> 01:53:47.499]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:53:47.499 --> 01:53:55.760]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.321]  The Obama Deception.
[01:53:57.321 --> 01:54:01.761]  The people strike back.
[01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:05.122]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[01:54:05.726 --> 01:54:07.747]  Don't rely on others for protection.
[01:54:07.747 --> 01:54:11.329]  Protect yourself and your family with products from Pepperspray.com.
[01:54:11.329 --> 01:54:16.712]  Pepperspray.com carries the largest assortment of pepper spray and personal safety devices on the web.

[01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:31.019]  Order the Discreet Pepper Mace Baton, which relies on a powerful pepper formula that upon direct contact with an attacker's eyes, forces them to slam shut, causing an intense burning sensation.
[01:54:31.019 --> 01:54:34.140]  This refillable unit is designed to be carried as a key ring.
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:35.021]  Easily accessible
[01:54:35.441 --> 01:54:36.021]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.311 --> 01:55:12.695]  We are back live, going live at 8 after at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting the last hour and 50 minutes.
[01:55:12.695 --> 01:55:14.557]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:55:14.557 --> 01:55:17.238]  Larry in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:55:17.238 --> 01:55:17.879]  Uh, yeah, hey Alex?
[01:55:17.879 --> 01:55:18.219]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:18.219 --> 01:55:18.499]  Yeah, uh...
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.141]  Are you with me?
[01:55:32.141 --> 01:55:33.802]  Yeah, I sure got you on the line right now, bro.
[01:55:33.802 --> 01:55:34.662]  I'd love to talk to you.
[01:55:34.662 --> 01:55:35.183]  All right, man.
[01:55:35.183 --> 01:55:37.084]  I want to say this, man.
[01:55:37.084 --> 01:55:41.247]  I do not support the troops in Iraq.
[01:55:41.247 --> 01:55:45.190]  In fact, I wrote a little poem.
[01:55:45.190 --> 01:55:47.251]  I'm making a song out of it.
[01:55:47.251 --> 01:55:55.537]  It's called, if you are an American with a gun in Iraq, I hope you come back in a body sack.
[01:55:55.537 --> 01:56:00.701]  If you're an American with a gun in the Middle East, I hope you get devoured by the beast.
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:07.523]  If you're an American with a gun in Pakistan, I hope you die where you stand!
[01:56:07.523 --> 01:56:15.788]  Sir, sir, listen, I happen to have family over in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they joined for reasons they believe were good.
[01:56:15.788 --> 01:56:21.011]  They bought the propaganda, and it doesn't hurt the New World Order for the troops to get killed.
[01:56:21.011 --> 01:56:28.615]  I really don't want to sit here hoping that, I hope Iraqis don't die, I hope the troops don't die, I hope the troops don't die in combat with the American people.
[01:56:28.615 --> 01:56:29.616]  I want to avert this.
[01:56:30.296 --> 01:56:32.417]  I understand you're angry and upset.
[01:56:32.417 --> 01:56:36.118]  There is over 1,300,000 Iraqis dead, many of them children.
[01:56:36.118 --> 01:56:41.741]  But, you know, I don't hope people die that have had abortions.
[01:56:41.741 --> 01:56:44.242]  I just hope they wake up to what they've been part of and repent.
[01:56:44.242 --> 01:56:49.604]  I mean, I just, you know what, I appreciate your call and you can hate me if you want, Larry, but I'm just not going to let that go any further, okay?
[01:56:49.604 --> 01:56:51.865]  Just not on this show.
[01:56:51.865 --> 01:56:54.026]  Okay, I hope that the troops don't die, okay?
[01:56:54.668 --> 01:56:55.689]  Fred in Florida.
[01:56:55.689 --> 01:56:56.470]  Fred, you're on the air.
[01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:57.330]  Go ahead.
[01:56:57.330 --> 01:56:58.751]  It's Frank with That Don't Matter.
[01:56:58.751 --> 01:56:59.392]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:56:59.392 --> 01:57:04.536]  I was on hold for two hours yesterday after your producer told me I was next, but it's so great to talk to you.
[01:57:04.536 --> 01:57:05.637]  I'm an eight-year subscriber.
[01:57:05.637 --> 01:57:11.842]  I've been distributing your material since 2000, beginning with America Destroyed by Design on VHS tape back then.
[01:57:11.842 --> 01:57:13.503]  Awesome.
[01:57:13.503 --> 01:57:14.484]  Well over 6,000.
[01:57:14.484 --> 01:57:16.346]  I got a big Xerox.
[01:57:16.346 --> 01:57:20.369]  We've only had prisonplanet.tv, though, for five years, but I appreciate you being a subscriber.
[01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:22.971]  I've been distributing your stuff.
[01:57:22.971 --> 01:57:24.251]  Oh, awesome.
[01:57:24.251 --> 01:57:24.791]  Awesome.
[01:57:24.791 --> 01:57:27.012]  Starting with America Destroyed by Design.
[01:57:27.012 --> 01:57:27.632]  Awesome.
[01:57:27.632 --> 01:57:37.096]  I cry often concerning the events of 9-11 as I have lost three friends, two of whom were blown to smithereens by controlled demolition incorporated.
[01:57:37.096 --> 01:57:40.277]  And I know people who've lost over a dozen loved ones that fateful day.
[01:57:40.277 --> 01:57:46.359]  I'd just like to air a few grievances briefly in a succinct G-rated manner.
[01:57:46.359 --> 01:57:47.500]  I'm extremely peed off.
[01:57:49.651 --> 01:58:06.618]  I wish you'd put up a Fred Tobin banner linked to the book, uh, Did Six Million Really Die?, and talk about the persecution of Ernst Zundel, question the Holohoaks, and see how quickly you'll get arrested when you enter Canada, England, or Germany.
[01:58:06.618 --> 01:58:16.022]  Now I notice you sometimes hang up quickly on articulate people who legitimately criticize you, and then spend five or ten or more minutes in the defense of tirade after you've disconnected them.
[01:58:17.688 --> 01:58:25.874]  It seems you've found a lucrative career in the Patriot business, making poor people run around chasing their tails, offering no real solutions.
[01:58:25.874 --> 01:58:29.357]  You're getting on the radio every day screaming like Sergeant Potter.
[01:58:29.357 --> 01:58:31.118]  Let's stop right there.
[01:58:31.118 --> 01:58:34.041]  We're moving to try to get the states to declare sovereignty.
[01:58:34.041 --> 01:58:39.585]  We are moving to have the bankers arrested and had a congressman on saying it thirty minutes ago.
[01:58:39.585 --> 01:58:41.446]  Thirty-five minutes is going to be technical.
[01:58:41.446 --> 01:58:44.649]  We are moving to have an audit of the private Federal Reserve.
[01:58:44.649 --> 01:58:46.790]  We are moving to have the American people
[01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:48.852]  Say no to martial law.
[01:58:48.852 --> 01:59:03.309]  You know, I have you on the show, we don't screen your call, you come on here, and you sit here and you insult, and you attack me, and you say all these terrible things about me, and you say that I'm giving no solutions.
[01:59:03.309 --> 01:59:05.812]  I make a film that has cost me probably $80,000 or more to make,
[01:59:08.536 --> 01:59:10.938]  And I am going to release it for free on the internet.
[01:59:10.938 --> 01:59:13.260]  High quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:15.242]  And you call in and you say I'm bad.
[01:59:15.242 --> 01:59:16.964]  You call in and you say I'm evil.
[01:59:16.964 --> 01:59:17.964]  You know, here's the issue.
[01:59:17.964 --> 01:59:21.347]  I don't like the things Israel does and I criticize Israel.
[01:59:21.347 --> 01:59:30.095]  But I also don't want to be associated with the type of scum that make it their lives to simply hate Jews and everybody else.
[01:59:30.095 --> 01:59:32.998]  So you understand, I don't like what Israel's doing and I don't like you either.
[01:59:33.598 --> 01:59:35.481]  It's very, very simple and I hope you realize that.
[01:59:35.481 --> 01:59:36.843]  You could have had your say, sir.
[01:59:36.843 --> 01:59:39.706]  But you had to spew lies, so find another show.
[01:59:39.706 --> 01:59:45.955]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:59:45.955 --> 01:59:48.058]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:50.916 --> 01:59:52.597]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:52.597 --> 01:59:57.338]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:57.338 --> 02:00:00.299]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:00:00.299 --> 02:00:03.341]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line when you have your own bread.
[02:00:03.341 --> 02:00:06.962]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:00:07.142 --> 02:00:12.668]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:00:12.668 --> 02:00:19.676]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:00:19.676 --> 02:00:22.719]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:00:22.919 --> 02:00:23.359]  We're good to go.
[02:00:53.706 --> 02:00:56.108]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:56.108 --> 02:01:05.494]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:05.494 --> 02:01:06.795]  Big Brother.
[02:01:06.795 --> 02:01:08.576]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:08.576 --> 02:01:10.337]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:10.337 --> 02:01:11.918]  You want answers?
[02:01:11.918 --> 02:01:13.459]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:13.459 --> 02:01:17.662]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:17.662 --> 02:01:21.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:32.501 --> 02:01:34.521]  We are back live, taking your phone calls.
[02:01:34.521 --> 02:01:39.443]  Let's talk to Brian in Canada, then Joel, Rod Dogg, Ronnie Warren, and others.
[02:01:39.443 --> 02:01:42.023]  Go ahead, Brian, you're on the air.
[02:01:42.023 --> 02:01:52.286]  About two months ago, I started watching your show on YouTube, and one of the first videos I saw was about this CIA agent confession about FEMA.
[02:01:53.106 --> 02:02:20.053]  So I started, I'd done something kind of stupid and I started sending FEMA like funny emails of rabbits attacking snakes and a rabbit attacking a goat and some beavis and butthead things and now in Toronto for some reason we seem to have all these FEMA triple-decker trains and on Thursday the 5th of March a black helicopter flew over my house in downtown West Toronto
[02:02:20.765 --> 02:02:25.827]  Three times circle in my house, the third time it kind of locked its little gun on me, and it flew away.
[02:02:25.827 --> 02:02:29.989]  And I just stood there with my mouth open and I was like... Well, let's understand.
[02:02:29.989 --> 02:02:33.371]  Northcom that rules Canada as well is flying grid patterns.
[02:02:34.488 --> 02:02:40.470]  With look-through technology that looks right through your walls and scans for weapons and what you've got.
[02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:41.690]  And so they fly in grid patterns.
[02:02:41.690 --> 02:02:44.090]  Everybody gets black helicopter visits.
[02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:47.431]  And the Feds admit they have these helicopters flying around.
[02:02:47.431 --> 02:02:53.093]  And they also have high-altitude blimps that are at over 95 to 100,000 feet.
[02:02:53.093 --> 02:02:54.693]  That's admitted.
[02:02:54.693 --> 02:02:55.713]  And so that's what's going on.
[02:02:55.713 --> 02:02:56.654]  But I appreciate your call.
[02:02:56.654 --> 02:02:58.134]  They can't get all of us.
[02:02:58.134 --> 02:02:59.514]  And the people are waking up.
[02:02:59.514 --> 02:03:01.155]  Let's talk to Joel in California.
[02:03:01.155 --> 02:03:01.895]  Joel, you're on the air.
[02:03:04.554 --> 02:03:05.934]  Good sir.
[02:03:05.934 --> 02:03:07.815]  Hey, I'm so happy to be able to talk to you.
[02:03:07.815 --> 02:03:10.236]  I've been listening to you.
[02:03:10.236 --> 02:03:23.500]  Woke up probably 2005, first video I found was you sneaking into the Bohemian Grove and I said this guy's got a huge set of you-know-what and I want to see more about and hear more from him.
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:28.202]  I can't believe the guys that call you and waste your time and talk about no solution.
[02:03:28.202 --> 02:03:29.302]  I think that you've got a
[02:03:30.534 --> 02:03:32.475]  Look, all we cover is solutions.
[02:03:32.475 --> 02:03:35.455]  We're the most effective, so that's why we get attacked.
[02:03:35.455 --> 02:03:39.016]  But most people aren't operatives that call in and do that.
[02:03:39.016 --> 02:03:43.798]  They think I have some wonderful life, and all I do is bust my butt, and it's actually a very hard life.
[02:03:43.798 --> 02:03:48.119]  And so, it's just part of the sick society, and I'm not even really worried about it.
[02:03:48.119 --> 02:03:51.800]  Let's just keep moving forward with solutions, and that is waking the people up.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:56.321]  Yeah, you know, I wish I could hang out with you and pick your brain.
[02:03:56.949 --> 02:04:03.632]  I know you're always on the move and quick, but I live out here in Temecula, California.
[02:04:03.632 --> 02:04:04.913]  Nice little suite.
[02:04:04.913 --> 02:04:13.797]  Everyone thinks they're a movie star and no one wants to listen to anything that you have to say or if I even mention 9-11 or Obama.
[02:04:13.797 --> 02:04:17.078]  I get that same thing that a lot of people are getting.
[02:04:17.078 --> 02:04:21.100]  I remember just growing up, I'm only 29 and I've always been in rock bands.
[02:04:21.730 --> 02:04:27.815]  And just, you know, playing baseball, living the American somewhat dream or whatever it used to be.
[02:04:27.815 --> 02:04:31.858]  But I remember it used to be like amazing to see a military helicopter.
[02:04:31.858 --> 02:04:35.581]  You'd be like, oh wow, we live in between like March Air Force Base and Camp Pendleton.
[02:04:35.581 --> 02:04:37.843]  And you'd be like, oh, look dad, see there.
[02:04:37.843 --> 02:04:39.885]  And you know, my dad was in the military.
[02:04:39.885 --> 02:04:41.807]  And like a rare thing.
[02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:46.230]  Now it's every day you have your Blackhawks or whatever you call them.
[02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:48.472]  I don't know what they're called, but they're like serious.
[02:04:48.472 --> 02:04:49.313]  The real deal.
[02:04:49.313 --> 02:04:50.654]  Like you think, you know,
[02:04:51.112 --> 02:04:53.213]  You think you're about to be attacked, you know?
[02:04:53.213 --> 02:05:12.718]  You've got, like, fleets of them every day, all day, and, you know, this is in a place where you just, you think it's a home sweet home, nothing's going down, but, I mean, would you call that, like, just part of them trying to, like, you know, wash our brains and make us get used to hearing that sound?
[02:05:12.718 --> 02:05:18.339]  I mean, I've had helicopters fly so low to our houses where we live in a manufactured home, it feels like
[02:05:18.843 --> 02:05:22.985]  The guy's landing on our three acres.
[02:05:22.985 --> 02:05:31.809]  Well, you know, call after call, talking about how the military's all over us, they admit they're acclimating us for military occupation of the United States.
[02:05:31.809 --> 02:05:33.909]  It is happening.
[02:05:33.909 --> 02:05:34.890]  It is high treason.
[02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:41.813]  And we've got to let the military know they're engaged in treason, and remind them of their oath.
[02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:44.110]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.371 --> 02:06:05.895]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:06:05.895 --> 02:06:10.999]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:06:10.999 --> 02:06:12.500]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:16.123]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:06:16.123 --> 02:06:21.527]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:06:21.527 --> 02:06:27.312]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:06:27.632 --> 02:06:30.135]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:06:30.135 --> 02:06:32.677]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:06:32.677 --> 02:06:35.099]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:06:35.099 --> 02:06:36.300]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:37.481]  No animal testing.
[02:06:37.481 --> 02:06:38.823]  I use them and love them.
[02:06:38.823 --> 02:06:40.724]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:06:40.724 --> 02:06:42.126]  And I say big time.
[02:06:42.126 --> 02:06:43.387]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:06:43.387 --> 02:06:43.627]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:06:43.627 --> 02:06:45.289]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:06:53.616 --> 02:07:01.744]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:07:01.744 --> 02:07:06.970]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:07:07.768 --> 02:07:13.650]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:20.131]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:07:20.131 --> 02:07:22.112]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:07:22.112 --> 02:07:24.572]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:07:24.572 --> 02:07:35.455]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:07:37.759 --> 02:07:39.420]  It's not about left or right.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:41.282]  It's about a one world government.
[02:07:41.282 --> 02:07:48.206]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:07:48.206 --> 02:07:56.472]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:56.472 --> 02:07:58.033]  The Obama Deception.
[02:07:58.033 --> 02:07:59.234]  The people strike back.
[02:08:01.368 --> 02:08:09.449]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[02:08:09.449 --> 02:08:11.050]  You need the Paclite.
[02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:19.271]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[02:08:19.271 --> 02:08:22.832]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[02:08:22.832 --> 02:08:27.653]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[02:08:27.653 --> 02:08:28.913]  The Paclite is so durable,
[02:08:29.193 --> 02:08:34.037]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[02:08:34.037 --> 02:08:38.701]  The PackLite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[02:08:38.701 --> 02:08:45.687]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[02:08:45.687 --> 02:08:49.270]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.
[02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:50.711]  Or, call us today at 877-715-7000.
[02:08:54.394 --> 02:08:58.678]  4448, that's 877-715-4448.
[02:08:58.678 --> 02:09:09.047]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:09:09.047 --> 02:09:12.010]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:27.284 --> 02:09:31.206]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the next hour and 52 minutes.
[02:09:31.206 --> 02:09:35.669]  It's left in the show today, simulcasting the radio show.
[02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:43.373]  We have Webster Tarpley joining us about 50 minutes from now to give us the latest on Obama's criminal activities.
[02:09:43.373 --> 02:09:47.195]  Then we're going to have Keith Bryan on from Ireland.
[02:09:47.195 --> 02:09:50.057]  Mainstream news is reporting that they were doing drills
[02:09:50.757 --> 02:09:59.722]  When the military men in Northern Ireland got shot, the British troops, as we predicted they would, and it's coming out, that the guards stood down and didn't shoot at the people that were shooting.
[02:09:59.722 --> 02:10:11.189]  So, and with over 75% of the past attacks in Northern Ireland and Ireland and in England being connected and carried out by British Special Forces, SAS, as has been covered by mainstream British news,
[02:10:12.330 --> 02:10:17.073]  We are, and that's why they had to stop a lot of it four or five years ago, because it did become public.
[02:10:17.073 --> 02:10:18.574]  It looks like they're back to their old tricks.
[02:10:18.574 --> 02:10:22.216]  It's almost completely confirmed, the classic MO on that front.
[02:10:22.216 --> 02:10:27.680]  For the next 20 minutes, we are joined by Terry Bresci.
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:28.840]  And Terry Bresci,
[02:10:31.488 --> 02:10:44.961]  is an individual who lives somewhere near the border and they've now moved border checkpoints in some cases a hundred miles away from the border they call them constitution free zones and they're harassing citizens and I would add here that we support the border patrol and their constitutional duty.
[02:10:44.961 --> 02:10:47.263]  It's one of the few things the feds do that's constitutional and we support it.
[02:10:48.124 --> 02:10:48.464]  We're good to go.
[02:11:10.902 --> 02:11:16.764]  Illegal aliens are allowed to get the stimulus money, and they don't have to show that they're American citizens like citizens do.
[02:11:16.764 --> 02:11:19.966]  It's literally just a double standard.
[02:11:19.966 --> 02:11:23.467]  So, Terry Bresse, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:11:23.467 --> 02:11:24.368]  Thank you for having me.
[02:11:24.368 --> 02:11:25.348]  Good to be here.
[02:11:25.348 --> 02:11:31.571]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're located, and some of the plethora of YouTube videos that you've got.
[02:11:31.571 --> 02:11:39.494]  We're going to put a few of them up on screen without the audio, you know, showing what you go through and what happens at these checkpoints inside the United States.
[02:11:40.931 --> 02:11:42.292]  Sure.
[02:11:42.292 --> 02:11:56.124]  I live in Tucson, Arizona, which is about 40 miles north of the international border with Mexico, and I frequent State Route 86, which is an east-west highway that takes me out to one of my remote work sites.
[02:11:56.124 --> 02:12:07.053]  I work up at the Cape Cod National Observatory, and we have a couple telescopes up there that I keep running and I observe on to look for asteroids and comets in the solar system.
[02:12:07.705 --> 02:12:18.494]  So, my work takes me along remote sections of the desert on a fairly regular basis, and this is where I've encountered quite a few checkpoints over the years.
[02:12:18.494 --> 02:12:24.859]  Break down what you're dealing with and the type of things you go through.
[02:12:24.859 --> 02:12:32.125]  Well, you know, what first got me interested or first got me involved with this issue of checkpoints was an incident from 2002.
[02:12:33.490 --> 02:12:49.718]  I was traveling back to Tucson after working the day on the mountain, and I was stopped at a checkpoint that was being operated primarily by the tribal police, but there was also present the Department of Homeland Security in the form of U.S.
[02:12:49.718 --> 02:12:54.280]  Customs agents and Border Patrol agents who were working the front line with the tribal police.
[02:12:55.123 --> 02:13:01.804]  And when I pulled up to the checkpoint and was stopped, I asked the stopping officer what was the purpose of the checkpoint.
[02:13:01.804 --> 02:13:03.825]  And he told me that it was a sobriety checkpoint.
[02:13:03.825 --> 02:13:14.186]  And I'm thinking to myself, well, if it's a sobriety checkpoint, then you don't need federal agents working on the front line with local law enforcement officers to check sobriety.
[02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:16.167]  Because sobriety is a local issue.
[02:13:16.167 --> 02:13:16.927]  It's a state issue.
[02:13:16.927 --> 02:13:19.127]  It's not a federal issue.
[02:13:19.127 --> 02:13:24.168]  Just like they're now using Marines in California at DWI checkpoints to condition the public.
[02:13:25.031 --> 02:13:26.812]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:13:26.812 --> 02:13:38.900]  What I found is a lot of times local jurisdictions and the federal government, they use checkpoints that have been allowed by the courts under very limited scope.
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:44.243]  They use those as a pretext to do far more expensive operations than they would be allowed to otherwise.
[02:13:44.710 --> 02:14:00.926]  By claiming that it's only a sobriety checkpoint or it's an immigration checkpoint, but in reality they're doing these dragnet type of operations where they're looking for everything from felons to weapons, terrorists, narcotics, and other things.
[02:14:00.926 --> 02:14:06.291]  So it's really problematic in the way that law enforcement agencies have
[02:14:06.886 --> 02:14:19.757]  I've taken the inch that was given to them by the various courts and the American people in many regards, and it turned into a hundred-mile Constitution-free zone, if you will.
[02:14:19.757 --> 02:14:22.660]  Amazing, and we're putting some of those videos on screen.
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:28.565]  I mean, you explain to the Border Patrol, look, this is in a federal function, a sobriety checkpoint.
[02:14:28.565 --> 02:14:34.110]  We see the mainstream reports how they're targeting citizens, how illegal aliens just drive right through, but they target
[02:14:34.810 --> 02:14:35.010]  I don't
[02:14:53.005 --> 02:14:54.826]  You know, it's happening all over Seattle now.
[02:14:54.826 --> 02:14:57.506]  They're doing it to people in Seattle and surrounding counties.
[02:14:57.506 --> 02:15:01.848]  They're doing it deep into other states, Wyoming and Utah and other places.
[02:15:01.848 --> 02:15:09.570]  I mean, clearly, this is the federal police force expanding, and you explain this to them in the videos, don't you?
[02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:10.750]  I certainly do.
[02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:13.731]  Well, actually, I take that back.
[02:15:13.731 --> 02:15:22.434]  Going back to my 2002 incident, like I said, it was a dragnet operation that was being primarily conducted by the tribal police.
[02:15:23.267 --> 02:15:29.310]  Um, and so it was, that operation was slightly different from what I've been experiencing over the past year.
[02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:37.274]  And that particular operation, when I challenged the scope of what they were doing, I was dragged out of my vehicle, arrested and dragged off the side of the road.
[02:15:37.274 --> 02:15:38.815]  I fought the chargers in court.
[02:15:38.815 --> 02:15:41.516]  I beat the charges and had them dismissed with prejudice.
[02:15:41.516 --> 02:15:43.637]  And then I turned around and I filed a lawsuit.
[02:15:43.637 --> 02:15:47.519]  That lawsuit has been ongoing for the past five years.
[02:15:48.166 --> 02:15:54.193]  And it's currently in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals where we're challenging the legitimacy of the checkpoint itself.
[02:15:54.193 --> 02:15:57.958]  The newer checkpoints that I've come across since January of 2008
[02:15:59.201 --> 02:16:08.266]  ...have been conducted solely by the Department of Homeland Security via Customs and Border Protection agents with the United States Border Patrol.
[02:16:08.266 --> 02:16:17.411]  But the problem that we see here is, once again, it's very similar, and you can see it in articles where spokespersons for the U.S.
[02:16:17.411 --> 02:16:25.636]  Border Patrol have stated that they're using these immigration checkpoints to look for felons, weapons, not talking about guns,
[02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:30.974]  Uh, here, um, narcotics, uh, terrorists and aliens.
[02:16:30.974 --> 02:16:31.675]  Even though the U.S.
[02:16:31.675 --> 02:16:43.207]  Supreme Court, uh, back in 1976, they allowed immigration checkpoints inside the country, but only for permanent checkpoint installations and only near nexus points for border traffic.
[02:16:43.207 --> 02:16:48.913]  And what that means is where the primary traffic going to the checkpoint originated from the border.
[02:16:50.069 --> 02:17:02.901]  What they're doing now is, instead of conducting these checkpoints at permanent installations near nexus points, they're conducting them all over the place, along secondary roads, along roads that have no direct nexus to the border.
[02:17:02.901 --> 02:17:05.183]  And they're far exceeding the scope that the U.S.
[02:17:05.183 --> 02:17:06.644]  Supreme Court said.
[02:17:06.644 --> 02:17:14.792]  And what they stated was that very brief stops were allowed at these internal immigration checkpoints for the sole purpose of making immigration queries.
[02:17:15.342 --> 02:17:26.185]  And that any further detention or any further or any searching of the vehicle had to be premised upon probable cause or consent by the driver.
[02:17:26.185 --> 02:17:32.887]  But what the Border Patrol is actually doing is they're conducting temporary or tactical checkpoints all over the place.
[02:17:32.887 --> 02:17:41.589]  And they're admitting that they're looking for a whole host of other subjects besides just illegal aliens.
[02:17:42.413 --> 02:17:49.875]  And they are detaining individuals for a long period of time and searching vehicles absent consent or absent probable cause.
[02:17:49.875 --> 02:17:55.036]  And also, they don't like being photographed by you, but they're there photographing, videotaping you.
[02:17:55.036 --> 02:17:55.976]  Right, right.
[02:17:55.976 --> 02:17:56.577]  Exactly.
[02:17:56.577 --> 02:18:00.838]  So, from my first experience in 2002, I learned a lot.
[02:18:00.838 --> 02:18:09.860]  I learned that law enforcement agents will lie when you bring them into court, that they will destroy documentation and evidence.
[02:18:10.647 --> 02:18:13.909]  And that they will misrepresent the nature of what they're doing.
[02:18:13.909 --> 02:18:40.067]  So in order to protect myself from future actions after 2002, I started carrying video cameras with me, recording devices, cell phones, so that I could, A, contact other people when I know that I was going to enter a checkpoint, so that other people know where I was and what to expect, and B, so that I could make a record of what actually happened, so that there would be no doubt in a court of law as to what actually happened.
[02:18:40.937 --> 02:18:56.343]  And so, since 2008, when the Border Patrol set up this particular checkpoint along SR 86, that's been there 24-7 for the last year, I've documented over 70 checkpoint stops going through that particular checkpoint.
[02:18:56.343 --> 02:19:01.945]  And as you indicated, I have about 14 or 15 of those video encounters online.
[02:19:04.195 --> 02:19:15.581]  Well, you're doing a great job, and there's video after video posted on your website, you have them up on YouTube, it's checkpointusa.com, and, uh, I mean, they get very, very belligerent when you say, look, I'm a U.S.
[02:19:15.581 --> 02:19:26.907]  citizen, leave me alone, you know, why are you out here doing a DWI or a weapons check or a drug checkpoint, you're supposed to be checking for illegal aliens, and then in every case we find out they're not going after the illegal aliens, they're going after citizens.
[02:19:28.069 --> 02:19:36.632]  Well, what's interesting is I don't, you know, I've done a lot of research into what's been going on and it hasn't just been limited to checkpoints.
[02:19:36.632 --> 02:19:46.556]  If you look on my website, the checkpointusa.org, you'll also find various documents from the... No, it's not org, they put comma on my sheet, I'm sorry.
[02:19:46.556 --> 02:19:48.837]  It's checkpointusa.org.
[02:19:48.837 --> 02:19:49.958]  Right, right.
[02:19:49.958 --> 02:19:56.040]  What you'll find is from 2007 there is a study that was done by the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:19:56.556 --> 02:20:21.518]  And what he found was that on an annual basis, the Border Patrol, through the, I think it's the Office of Detention and Removal, that they were, about 33% of every illegal alien that's taken into custody on an annual basis, those individuals are re-released back into the country while awaiting deportation orders from a federal court.
[02:20:22.293 --> 02:20:26.818]  And about 75% of those individuals that have been released, they abscond.
[02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:27.859]  They run.
[02:20:27.859 --> 02:20:30.943]  And this has been an ongoing thing for years and years.
[02:20:30.943 --> 02:20:40.173]  It's well documented, it's well known by these federal agencies, yet they take these guys into custody, they let them back into the country, and then they run.
[02:20:40.856 --> 02:20:47.518]  And then they claim that they have to conduct more internal checkpoints in order to... Terry Brassi from CheckpointUSA.org.
[02:20:47.518 --> 02:20:47.918]  Stay there.
[02:20:47.918 --> 02:20:55.941]  We're going to come right back to you after this quick break and continue discussing the important work you're doing out there defending the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.
[02:20:55.941 --> 02:20:57.041]  Stay with us, as well as the Tenth.
[02:21:01.095 --> 02:21:09.340]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:13.902]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[02:21:13.902 --> 02:21:18.585]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[02:21:18.585 --> 02:21:19.986]  It's a documented fact.
[02:21:20.166 --> 02:21:27.630]  Almost 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:39.717]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[02:21:39.717 --> 02:21:43.399]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[02:21:43.999 --> 02:21:47.121]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[02:21:47.121 --> 02:21:50.863]  FPP is so affordable, you can't afford to do without.

[02:21:54.365 --> 02:21:54.745]  That's 888-949-3570.
[02:21:54.745 --> 02:21:57.187]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[02:22:04.770 --> 02:22:07.393]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.393 --> 02:22:14.441]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:14.961 --> 02:22:21.548]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.548 --> 02:22:23.530]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.530 --> 02:22:26.033]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:26.033 --> 02:22:37.004]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.609 --> 02:22:39.269]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.269 --> 02:22:41.130]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.130 --> 02:22:48.031]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:22:56.293 --> 02:22:57.874]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.874 --> 02:22:59.074]  The people strike back.
[02:23:00.922 --> 02:23:01.443]  Good day.
[02:23:01.443 --> 02:23:03.005]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:23:03.005 --> 02:23:03.265]  March 10th, 2009.
[02:23:03.265 --> 02:23:04.166]  Gold open this morning at $9.1070.
[02:23:04.166 --> 02:23:07.110]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.3707, $4.6854 for the half-ounce, and $2.3427 for a quarter-ounce.
[02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.611]  That's $9.3707, $4.6854, and $2.3427.
[02:23:18.666 --> 02:23:22.550]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:26.674]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[02:23:26.674 --> 02:23:31.239]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[02:23:31.239 --> 02:23:36.464]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[02:23:36.644 --> 02:23:39.827]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[02:23:39.827 --> 02:23:43.490]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust and confidence?
[02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:45.472]  Or is it time to insure your hard-earned wealth?
[02:23:45.472 --> 02:23:50.716]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[02:23:50.716 --> 02:23:53.279]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[02:23:53.279 --> 02:23:55.080]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:55.941]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:01.619 --> 02:24:07.121]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:24:07.121 --> 02:24:07.922]  and the world.
[02:24:07.922 --> 02:24:11.783]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:24:11.783 --> 02:24:18.286]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:24:18.286 --> 02:24:20.307]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:24:20.307 --> 02:24:28.250]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:24:28.530 --> 02:24:33.235]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:24:33.235 --> 02:24:39.041]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:24:39.041 --> 02:24:41.223]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:24:41.223 --> 02:24:43.466]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:24:43.806 --> 02:24:44.906]  Free of charge.
[02:24:44.906 --> 02:24:45.227]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[02:24:45.227 --> 02:24:45.307]  1-800-453-2202.

[02:24:50.768 --> 02:24:53.069]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:24.002]  Webster Tarpley coming up with key info.
[02:25:24.002 --> 02:25:34.091]  Keith Bryan from Ireland with the inside job going on over there shooting military police.
[02:25:34.091 --> 02:25:39.155]  Chess Kane joining us to talk about micro FM transmitters that are totally legal to go out three miles.
[02:25:39.155 --> 02:25:40.016]  FCC approved.
[02:25:42.452 --> 02:25:45.894]  Terry Bresci from CheckpointUSA.org.
[02:25:45.894 --> 02:25:50.196]  Please continue, sir, with specifically people who haven't seen the videos yet at your site.
[02:25:50.196 --> 02:25:56.339]  I mean, the type of hell you go through just declaring your rights to the Border Patrol when you're nowhere near the border.
[02:25:56.339 --> 02:25:57.879]  Sure.
[02:25:57.879 --> 02:26:03.722]  Well, it can be a pretty intimidating experience as some of the Checkpoint videos there show.
[02:26:03.722 --> 02:26:07.084]  These agents, from my perspective, are minimally trained.
[02:26:07.608 --> 02:26:13.910]  to understand the proper scope of their authority and the rights of the individuals that are actually stopping there.
[02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:31.235]  And they often, at times, try to exceed their scope of their authority by browbeating or threatening individuals that they stop to either completely comply with them or face any number of actions taken against them.
[02:26:33.737 --> 02:26:52.990]  The basis of how I respond when I come up to these checkpoints is that as an individual, as an American, I have a right to travel within my own country without being impeded or molested by federal agents, unless they have a reason to believe that I've either harmed somebody else or that I've damaged property.
[02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.891]  Those are the basis.
[02:26:53.891 --> 02:27:00.275]  It's a hallmark of a free country to be able to travel freely without having to explain who you are,
[02:27:00.737 --> 02:27:05.741]  Where you're going, why you're going there, or any of those other things.
[02:27:05.741 --> 02:27:15.969]  And these internal checkpoints are a direct challenge to the rights of individuals to travel freely within their own country.
[02:27:15.969 --> 02:27:28.358]  So as I approach these checkpoints, the agents oftentimes, they stop you, they want to know your citizenship, they want to see your documentation.
[02:27:29.265 --> 02:27:36.069]  And, um, what I ask them is whether or not I'm being detained and whether or not I'm free to go.
[02:27:36.069 --> 02:27:45.015]  And oftentimes, as you watch the checkpoint videos, what you'll see is that I'll ask if I'm being detained and the agent will say, no, you're not being detained.
[02:27:45.015 --> 02:27:56.922]  Well, if you understand what detained means, that means that you're engaged in a consensual, um, interaction with a law enforcement officer and either party can break off that interaction, um, at their leisure.
[02:27:56.922 --> 02:27:57.202]  So,
[02:27:58.149 --> 02:28:01.972]  If I'm not being detained, then that follows that I must be free to go.
[02:28:01.972 --> 02:28:05.074]  But when I seek that clarification and I ask them, am I free to go?
[02:28:05.074 --> 02:28:08.256]  They'll say, no, you cannot leave until you answer our questions.
[02:28:08.256 --> 02:28:09.237]  So it's color of law.
[02:28:09.237 --> 02:28:14.441]  They want you to violate your 4th and 5th Amendment, your 10th Amendment, state's rights, 9th Amendment being violated.
[02:28:14.441 --> 02:28:19.484]  And so they hold you in this color of law, no man's land, or this purgatory.
[02:28:19.484 --> 02:28:20.005]  Right.
[02:28:20.005 --> 02:28:20.745]  Right.
[02:28:20.745 --> 02:28:21.706]  Exactly.
[02:28:21.706 --> 02:28:24.748]  And it becomes a waiting game, if you will.
[02:28:24.748 --> 02:28:27.030]  You know, I'm pretty sure I've done a lot of research on the law.
[02:28:27.949 --> 02:28:30.592]  Um, I've, uh, I've written about it a lot.
[02:28:30.592 --> 02:28:35.516]  I've spoken about it a lot, and I'm pretty sure, uh, with regards to what my rights are here.
[02:28:35.516 --> 02:28:41.381]  And so I'll just wait them out, um, until they either get tired of messing with me
[02:28:42.292 --> 02:28:43.693]  Or their supervisors.
[02:28:43.693 --> 02:28:45.314]  And this is what's quite interesting now.
[02:28:45.314 --> 02:28:48.356]  Like I said, I've been to this checkpoint about 70 times now.
[02:28:48.356 --> 02:29:00.244]  And, you know, 75% of the time, the agents that are on duty are smart enough to understand their limited scope and my rights, and they just wade me through.
[02:29:00.244 --> 02:29:08.809]  But 25% of the time, you get an agent who doesn't like the fact that someone isn't, you know, basically kissing their feet.
[02:29:10.050 --> 02:29:22.021]  So they try to jack up the incidents by making it much more difficult for the person that they're stopping.
[02:29:22.021 --> 02:29:29.428]  So they'll claim, oftentimes, that they have the power and the authority to indefinitely detain anybody
[02:29:29.907 --> 02:29:36.873]  Until that person proves to the agent's satisfaction that they are a United States citizen.
[02:29:36.873 --> 02:29:43.319]  Well, if you understand your basic rights and the Constitution at all, you realize that that is completely bogus.
[02:29:43.806 --> 02:29:49.710]  Now the courts have recognized that Border Patrol agents have the authority at the border when someone is trying to come into the country.
[02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:51.991]  But they have the authority to indefinitely detain.
[02:30:14.186 --> 02:30:17.227]  Then in court, still you can shoot it down.
[02:30:17.227 --> 02:30:25.431]  But clearly, this is a fishing expedition to expand unconstitutional authority across the United States in areas of more than two-thirds of the nation.
[02:30:25.431 --> 02:30:34.194]  I want to come back and briefly finish up with you, then go ahead and get our next guest online as well, sir, but I want to talk more about how folks can check out what you're doing and duplicate what you're doing at Checkpoint
[02:30:34.754 --> 02:30:38.577]  USA.org with our guest Terry Bresci.
[02:30:38.577 --> 02:30:39.418]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:39.418 --> 02:30:47.584]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, ArnoldExposed.com, TheObamaDeception.net.
[02:30:47.584 --> 02:30:48.985]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:48.985 --> 02:30:51.687]  There's a lot going on in the background, by the way.
[02:30:51.687 --> 02:30:53.068]  We're on the march.
[02:30:53.068 --> 02:30:55.610]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:58.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:05.541]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[02:31:05.541 --> 02:31:09.183]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[02:31:09.183 --> 02:31:13.024]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[02:31:13.024 --> 02:31:16.245]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[02:31:16.245 --> 02:31:23.868]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology that holds in and reflects your own body heat.
[02:31:24.128 --> 02:31:25.809]  Soothing those sore areas.
[02:31:25.809 --> 02:31:28.491]  Solar Therm is extremely light and comfortable to wear.
[02:31:28.491 --> 02:31:32.694]  And increases blood flow to the affected areas without the use of toxic chemicals.
[02:31:32.694 --> 02:31:38.538]  Imagine being able to finally relieve the aches and pains in your elbows, knees, wrists, back, and more.
[02:31:38.538 --> 02:31:41.120]  So forget about messy creams that have an unpleasant smell.
[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:43.861]  Try Solartherm, the pain care you wear.
[02:31:43.861 --> 02:31:44.881]  Call them today at 1-877-747-6664.
[02:31:44.881 --> 02:31:45.281]  That's 1-877-747-6664.
[02:31:45.281 --> 02:31:46.701]  Or visit them online at solartherm.ca.
[02:31:46.701 --> 02:31:48.162]  That's solar, T-H-E-R-M, solartherm.ca.
[02:31:48.162 --> 02:31:51.722]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:32:07.953 --> 02:32:13.838]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:32:13.838 --> 02:32:20.322]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:32:20.322 --> 02:32:22.304]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:32:22.304 --> 02:32:24.766]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:32:24.766 --> 02:32:35.654]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:32:37.947 --> 02:32:39.609]  It's not about left or right.
[02:32:39.609 --> 02:32:41.470]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:32:41.470 --> 02:32:48.377]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:32:48.377 --> 02:32:56.644]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:56.644 --> 02:32:58.226]  The Obama Deception.
[02:32:58.226 --> 02:33:01.148]  The people strike back.
[02:33:01.148 --> 02:33:03.751]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:07.698]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[02:33:07.698 --> 02:33:11.482]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[02:33:11.482 --> 02:33:18.068]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[02:33:18.068 --> 02:33:23.293]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[02:33:23.293 --> 02:33:29.999]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[02:33:30.299 --> 02:33:31.400]  Need something more?
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:35.342]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[02:33:35.342 --> 02:33:43.648]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[02:33:43.648 --> 02:33:47.991]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[02:33:48.151 --> 02:33:50.912]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:25.405]  You know, I can't talk about what's going on behind the scenes right now here, but I'll tell you this, ladies and gentlemen, they do not want the Obama deception to come out.
[02:34:25.405 --> 02:34:30.567]  I'm gonna tell you right now, look for launch in the next 12 hours.
[02:34:30.567 --> 02:34:34.449]  Let me tell you, this stuff's real.
[02:34:34.449 --> 02:34:41.813]  The threats, the intimidation, the things we go through here, they confirm everything we know about the enemy.
[02:34:44.107 --> 02:34:46.168]  It doesn't matter.
[02:34:46.168 --> 02:34:48.989]  You're only alive once, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:48.989 --> 02:34:53.591]  The enemy knows the sleeping giant that is liberty and freedom is rising.
[02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:55.692]  They know you have power.
[02:34:55.692 --> 02:34:59.853]  That's why they're trying to block us every way they have.
[02:34:59.853 --> 02:35:02.554]  So I will tell everybody right now, the Obama deception is going to drop.
[02:35:02.554 --> 02:35:04.495]  It's probably dropping today.
[02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:06.356]  Get ready at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:06.356 --> 02:35:09.577]  I'm being forced to do this.
[02:35:09.577 --> 02:35:11.538]  Because we may not have a chance if we wait.
[02:35:11.538 --> 02:35:13.559]  And I'm showing my hand to the enemies listening right now.
[02:35:15.356 --> 02:35:16.316]  Launch the operation.
[02:35:16.316 --> 02:35:16.737]  Launch it.
[02:35:16.737 --> 02:35:17.837]  Launch it at all sites.
[02:35:17.837 --> 02:35:18.897]  Just go ahead and launch it.
[02:35:18.897 --> 02:35:19.538]  Launch it right now.
[02:35:19.538 --> 02:35:20.878]  I just made that decision.
[02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.139]  Launch the operation right now.
[02:35:22.139 --> 02:35:28.121]  We'll only have two or three versions of it up there for everybody.
[02:35:28.121 --> 02:35:36.624]  I wish the public knew how real this was.
[02:35:36.624 --> 02:35:43.907]  Terry Bresci, you're on the air.
[02:35:43.907 --> 02:35:44.087]  Yes.
[02:35:46.278 --> 02:35:51.720]  What I can recommend to other folks is that A, folks have to know what their rights are.
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:54.521]  B, they have to be willing to assert them.
[02:35:54.521 --> 02:35:56.682]  And C, you have to be willing to defend them.
[02:35:56.682 --> 02:36:08.966]  And in today's climate, I think people realize now that one of the most effective ways that you can defend your rights when you're asserting them in front of a law enforcement officer is to record your interactions.
[02:36:08.966 --> 02:36:14.168]  So if you're not doing anything wrong, and you're being intimidated or coerced,
[02:36:15.034 --> 02:36:22.097]  by a law enforcement officer at a random stop, either walking down the street or driving a vehicle down the road.
[02:36:22.097 --> 02:36:33.543]  The best thing that you can do to protect your rights is to record your interaction and be willing and able to make that recording available to the public at large.
[02:36:33.543 --> 02:36:42.687]  It's amazing how powerful basic tools that are available to any consumer in the marketplace today can be used to help you defend
[02:36:43.226 --> 02:36:47.187]  Your rights and what you think is important in today's day and age.
[02:36:47.187 --> 02:36:52.489]  And this is the technique that I use when I encounter suspicious checkpoints.
[02:36:52.489 --> 02:36:59.612]  I know my rights, I assert them, and I defend them by making a recording of those checkpoint stops and then posting them online.
[02:36:59.612 --> 02:37:06.154]  So people can see for themselves exactly what's happening, who's doing it, and why they claim they're doing it.
[02:37:06.154 --> 02:37:09.195]  That's right, and dead men tell no tales.
[02:37:09.195 --> 02:37:12.336]  So it's always important to get your information out, then you're somewhat protected.
[02:37:14.055 --> 02:37:15.215]  You've done this quite a few times.
[02:37:15.215 --> 02:37:22.657]  How many times have you been stopped by these people at their warrantless checkpoints and presented the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence?
[02:37:22.657 --> 02:37:24.897]  How many times, roughly?
[02:37:24.897 --> 02:37:29.758]  Well, I've been stopped at this checkpoint about 70 times in the last year.
[02:37:29.758 --> 02:37:32.339]  And this has been going on for six years?
[02:37:32.339 --> 02:37:36.859]  Well, this particular checkpoint has been in place for just over a year.
[02:37:36.859 --> 02:37:39.080]  You said since 2002, though, you've been going through this?
[02:37:40.254 --> 02:37:42.496]  Uh, well, 2002 was my first experience.
[02:37:42.496 --> 02:37:44.318]  In 2005, I had a couple more.
[02:37:44.318 --> 02:37:45.979]  They were just doing them temporarily.
[02:37:45.979 --> 02:37:47.761]  Like, every once in a while, they would pop up.
[02:37:48.174 --> 02:37:52.615]  But in 2008, January 2008, they changed how they were conducting them.
[02:37:52.615 --> 02:38:00.617]  Instead of doing them at random times, in random places, they set up along one specific location on the highway, and they left it open 24-7.
[02:38:00.617 --> 02:38:07.719]  So it's been open since January, early January of 2008, and it's been ongoing all that time.
[02:38:07.719 --> 02:38:15.921]  So, in the past, I had missed a fair amount because they weren't being done on any kind of a steady basis, but now they're being done constantly.
[02:38:16.568 --> 02:38:24.252]  And so every time I travel that road, it's guaranteed that I'll have to go through this particular checkpoint.
[02:38:24.252 --> 02:38:25.773]  Just incredible, my friend.
[02:38:25.773 --> 02:38:26.793]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:38:26.793 --> 02:38:31.935]  Well, as this continues to develop, we'll continue to check in with you at CheckpointUSA.org.
[02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:35.497]  And I want to thank Terry Bresci for coming on with us today.
[02:38:35.497 --> 02:38:36.638]  Thank you.
[02:38:36.638 --> 02:38:38.459]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:38:38.459 --> 02:38:41.940]  Okay.
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:43.341]  It's hard to continue on here.
[02:38:46.528 --> 02:38:50.190]  On the air right now.
[02:38:50.190 --> 02:38:55.292]  And, uh, just so sick of the New World Order.
[02:38:55.292 --> 02:38:57.213]  I'm sick of all their crap.
[02:38:57.213 --> 02:38:58.114]  But we know who they are.
[02:38:58.114 --> 02:38:58.934]  We know what they are.
[02:38:58.934 --> 02:38:59.915]  We know what has to be done.
[02:38:59.915 --> 02:39:05.357]  I just wish people valued how serious and how real this information is.
[02:39:05.357 --> 02:39:08.859]  I know a lot of you do, but sometimes I think I don't value it because, you know, I live it.
[02:39:08.859 --> 02:39:09.939]  I breathe it.
[02:39:09.939 --> 02:39:11.120]  I'm in this fight constantly.
[02:39:16.252 --> 02:39:20.196]  For other people it's like some social thing or it's like fun.
[02:39:20.196 --> 02:39:24.861]  It's fun to fight and defeat evil but it's not fun working this hard.
[02:39:24.861 --> 02:39:26.923]  It's not fun looking at these horrors all day.
[02:39:26.923 --> 02:39:34.932]  It's not fun knowing you're right and just seeing the evil continue and grow and just get worse and all the people it hurts and just all of it.
[02:39:37.042 --> 02:39:46.071]  Bernie Madoff out stealing and all the rest of them stealing and the banks openly looting everything and setting up world government and trumpeting it and every major newspaper saying how great it is.
[02:39:46.071 --> 02:39:52.678]  And still have people telling me the New World Order doesn't exist because they were following the pre-program brainwashing.
[02:40:10.558 --> 02:40:18.204]  You know, I got a bunch of trailers coming out for the Obama Deception, some promos, some sneak peeks and things that were supposed to start coming out in the next two days.
[02:40:18.204 --> 02:40:37.260]  You know, for the film to have its full effect, it needs to do that, but um... You know, the establishment... The FBI has a lot of dirty tricks, and they, under their Patriot Act, with their sneak and peek things, they can tell you, under federal law, that
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:44.804]  You're not even supposed to tell people what's going on.
[02:40:44.804 --> 02:40:49.406]  That's what this country has turned into, is a Soviet dirt pit.
[02:40:49.406 --> 02:40:53.789]  They talk about the blacklist for the communists, that's nothing compared to what patriots go through.
[02:40:53.789 --> 02:40:55.951]  There are congressional hearings!
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:04.663]  Where they show architects and engineers for 9-11 truth next to Al-Qaeda training videos and say the web has to be shut down.
[02:41:04.663 --> 02:41:08.726]  And they're having big Pentagon cybersecurity takeovers of the entire web.
[02:41:08.726 --> 02:41:14.489]  And the former head of Homeland Security Cybersecurity has resigned saying it's a total takeover.
[02:41:14.489 --> 02:41:18.912]  They admit Northcom and the Pentagon and everything else is for the American people!
[02:41:22.537 --> 02:41:33.825]  Tommy Chong tried to put out a film, aka Tommy Chong, about how they set him up and what they did to him, and they raided the film distribution center when the DVDs came in, and they confiscated them.
[02:41:33.825 --> 02:41:37.227]  Now, that blew up in their face.
[02:41:37.227 --> 02:41:44.392]  That blew up in their face, and the film went on Showtime and international television.
[02:41:44.392 --> 02:41:46.413]  And fortune favors the bold, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:53.701]  But I am sick and tired of the New World Order.
[02:41:53.701 --> 02:41:57.144]  I told you that when I took on Obama, this was serious.
[02:41:57.144 --> 02:42:00.406]  That I was going up against their biggest, baddest gladiator.
[02:42:00.406 --> 02:42:04.269]  And all of the throngs of soulless minions he's got.
[02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:09.273]  And those that do have souls but are deceived.
[02:42:09.273 --> 02:42:17.439]  And the threats my wife gets, the threats I get is nothing compared to the snake itself.
[02:42:17.439 --> 02:42:21.262]  Snooping around and trying to shut down what we are doing here.
[02:42:27.307 --> 02:42:30.868]  They know the Obama deception is the truth.
[02:42:30.868 --> 02:42:33.069]  They know that we understand their agenda.
[02:42:33.069 --> 02:42:35.109]  We know how to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[02:42:35.109 --> 02:42:38.110]  We know how to beat these people.
[02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:42.171]  Our information is going super-total-nova right now.
[02:42:42.171 --> 02:42:52.134]  And I'm going to tell the enemy, you picked the wrong side with the New World Order, and we're going to take this country back, and the tyrants and the treasonous, lecherous people will be brought to justice through courts of law.
[02:42:52.134 --> 02:42:52.534]  Know that.
[02:42:53.513 --> 02:42:59.756]  Just like Hitler's Germany, this tyranny will fall probably before it ever gets launched to the level that Hitler was able to carry out.
[02:42:59.756 --> 02:43:16.403]  The globalists just do their killing in third world nations with our troops.
[02:43:16.403 --> 02:43:18.244]  The Obama deception, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:43:20.239 --> 02:43:21.460]  You need to see it.
[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:22.320]  You need to have it.
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:23.661]  You need to get it out to everyone.
[02:43:23.661 --> 02:43:29.964]  And you need to remember that the enemy is scared of it.
[02:43:29.964 --> 02:43:36.327]  That Obama has an enemies list and you can better believe I'm on it.
[02:43:36.327 --> 02:43:38.929]  And most of all everybody needs to pray for what we do here.
[02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:39.909]  Pray for this ministry.
[02:43:39.909 --> 02:43:42.651]  It is a ministry of truth to the people of the world.
[02:43:42.651 --> 02:43:43.711]  A light.
[02:43:43.711 --> 02:43:45.132]  A lighthouse in these stormy times.
[02:43:47.188 --> 02:43:54.032]  Another way to get the word out is why I have this gentleman on for about 10 minutes, Chess Kane.
[02:43:54.032 --> 02:44:05.519]  We were made aware of, separately from Chess Kane, by Ham Radio Operators and others, of the best AM made right here in the U.S.
[02:44:05.519 --> 02:44:08.021]  that with a proper antenna goes out 3 miles strong.
[02:44:09.318 --> 02:44:11.440]  And is FCC legal?
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:12.381]  It's all civil anyways.
[02:44:12.381 --> 02:44:13.201]  FCC's civil.
[02:44:13.201 --> 02:44:14.863]  It follows the regulations.
[02:44:14.863 --> 02:44:17.445]  And if you put up signs in a dense area, you can reach tens of thousands.
[02:44:17.445 --> 02:44:18.666]  In rural areas, hundreds.
[02:44:18.666 --> 02:44:20.528]  And you just put up signs for the AM.
[02:44:20.528 --> 02:44:21.469]  You plug it into the internet.
[02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:22.770]  You stream my show, other shows.
[02:44:22.770 --> 02:44:35.201]  If my show isn't here... And... You get the information out.
[02:44:37.168 --> 02:44:46.194]  You get the information out, and someday when there's not even an internet if they're successful, you can tape the shows, play them back, you can get on the air yourself.
[02:44:46.194 --> 02:44:46.614]  That's what you do.
[02:44:46.614 --> 02:44:51.778]  You run it 24 hours a day, get an audience and do your own hour show every day or whatever you want.
[02:44:51.778 --> 02:44:53.899]  And it's a powerful tool.
[02:44:53.899 --> 02:44:57.222]  Now, when you call up Jez Kane, because I know I've had people talk to him.
[02:44:57.222 --> 02:44:58.242]  We'll try to give you all the technicals.
[02:44:58.242 --> 02:44:59.003]  It isn't that hard.
[02:44:59.003 --> 02:45:01.865]  You just get the basic equipment, hook it up, plug it in the internet, get going.
[02:45:04.938 --> 02:45:11.984]  So I would call Chess Cane and I would get this system, very inexpensive.
[02:45:11.984 --> 02:45:15.467]  I happen to know they're selling it basically at near cost, which I think is a mistake for them.
[02:45:15.467 --> 02:45:17.509]  You need to be able to fund your own operation.
[02:45:17.509 --> 02:45:18.890]  Trutham.com.
[02:45:18.890 --> 02:45:20.831]  Trutham.com.
[02:45:20.831 --> 02:45:23.614]  Because we then approached the makers of it and they said, look, we're too busy.
[02:45:23.614 --> 02:45:24.274]  We're engineers.
[02:45:24.274 --> 02:45:26.736]  We've made scores of products.
[02:45:26.736 --> 02:45:33.002]  And then we went out and found folks that were sub-sellers who did want to get them and sell them.
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:38.101]  So, that's why there's a little banner on InfoWars, but this is not a paid interview right now.
[02:45:38.101 --> 02:45:40.982]  I have them on because I believe in it.
[02:45:40.982 --> 02:45:42.702]  Ches Kane, good to have you on with us, sir.
[02:45:42.702 --> 02:45:46.763]  In the dark days of the Republic, this transmitter is what people need, isn't it?
[02:45:46.763 --> 02:45:49.144]  It sure is, and thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:45:49.144 --> 02:45:54.005]  I actually grew up across the other side of the lake from you over there in Dallas.
[02:45:54.005 --> 02:45:55.265]  Lake Ray Hubbard, huh?
[02:45:55.265 --> 02:45:57.646]  Yeah, just right there by Bryan Adams High School.
[02:45:57.646 --> 02:46:02.187]  So I know about this, and those cars you had about an hour ago, it's discouraging.
[02:46:03.737 --> 02:46:11.822]  That's the low of the low, and that's what keeps me pulling through this stuff, because there's a lot of good people that are in this trying to make this work.
[02:46:11.822 --> 02:46:23.109]  That Red Beckman interview you had a while back, it got me to get his book, The Walls in Our Minds, and it tells the difference between politicians and statesmen, and I decided, you know, I want to be a statesman, and that's why I did this.
[02:46:23.109 --> 02:46:30.033]  So, the inspiration from that in your Waco video, most people probably haven't seen that one.
[02:46:30.629 --> 02:46:45.216]  But it does show what one man can do, and it taught me that we... I was involved in the neocon side, I was going to school at DeVry when that happened, and I finally woke up to it and I said, if they can do Waco, anything's possible.
[02:46:45.216 --> 02:46:50.199]  Oklahoma City is the easiest one, so let me just tell you what this radio station has done for me in this area.
[02:46:50.199 --> 02:46:51.359]  I'm in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 150,000 people.
[02:46:53.396 --> 02:47:03.904]  Just last weekend, I played Pat Shannon's Oklahoma City documentary, and I also played one from Chris Emery with a 20-minute clip of yours, and I had maximum listenership.
[02:47:03.904 --> 02:47:09.047]  I had calls, I had emails, I want this video, give me this information.
[02:47:09.047 --> 02:47:12.830]  That is waking people up, and I can get it on the air.
[02:47:12.830 --> 02:47:19.515]  This is what one transmitter's doing, but you've also learned how to then have someone at the edge pick it up with an antenna and put it back out.
[02:47:20.433 --> 02:47:29.420]  Yeah, like one spot, we link two of them together and it shoots right up a main street and I'm putting a video up today that people can actually see me in the car demonstrating that just so they can see that.
[02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:37.586]  Okay, now if you just hook it up and don't do it right, it might go half a mile, but if you hook it up right, a little energy into it, three miles is what I'm told?
[02:47:37.586 --> 02:47:46.393]  Well, you're going to get a solid daytime one mile coverage if you do it an average, but if you really sit down and do it right and maybe get some help,
[02:47:47.134 --> 02:47:47.794]  Uh, yes.
[02:47:47.794 --> 02:47:48.375]  Three miles.
[02:47:48.375 --> 02:47:51.856]  I have a guy in Omaha that can pick up our Omaha transmitter three and a half miles away.
[02:47:51.856 --> 02:47:54.217]  He recorded it and emailed me the recording back.
[02:47:54.217 --> 02:47:56.238]  So that was verified.
[02:47:56.238 --> 02:47:59.759]  And, uh, it's a, it's a FCC certified unit.
[02:47:59.759 --> 02:48:02.441]  That means the FCC looked at the unit.
[02:48:02.441 --> 02:48:08.183]  Uh, the FCC said, yes, this unit when set at the proper level will not cause interference.
[02:48:08.183 --> 02:48:15.306]  And their statement basically is if you use one of these units, no one's going to bother you as long as we just don't want to know that you're there.
[02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:20.565]  So as long as you don't create a havoc, getting people's faith for the darn thing, nobody's going to bother you.
[02:48:22.049 --> 02:48:23.670]  You know, that's what you do with it.
[02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:30.032]  Well, these are such micro-units, too, that it's, I mean, maybe one out of a billion, and then it's FCC-approved, so there's no problem.
[02:48:30.032 --> 02:48:34.594]  You know, FMs, you go up with 100 watts or something and go out 20, 30 miles, you know.
[02:48:34.594 --> 02:48:37.055]  Folks keep their mouth shut about that, nothing really happens.
[02:48:37.055 --> 02:48:46.038]  But the point is, this is FCC-approved for general use, and you just find a clean, open spot on the dial, so there's not interference, the widest spot you can.
[02:48:46.918 --> 02:48:53.000]  Uh, and then you just put up little paper signs all around the listening area and it explodes.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  Well, here's the neatest thing about it.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:01.982]  Since I put this up, remember how a while back, you know, the people that were involved in the Ron Paul group, they lost steam and they kind of dispersed.
[02:49:01.982 --> 02:49:08.684]  Well, this has kind of kept everybody together and now we've seen eugenics right in our face here in South Dakota.
[02:49:08.684 --> 02:49:13.085]  So we've used this system to show people what's going on up here.
[02:49:13.746 --> 02:49:16.727]  And now we're writing in the newspapers, people are getting involved.
[02:49:16.727 --> 02:49:24.029]  Even one of the state representatives who voted the wrong way, she's now coming out and saying, the Department of... It's like a match.
[02:49:24.029 --> 02:49:26.669]  One little match can burn down the entire forest.
[02:49:26.669 --> 02:49:28.930]  Well, what did Thomas Jefferson say?
[02:49:28.930 --> 02:49:30.490]  These are good fires.
[02:49:30.490 --> 02:49:35.872]  One person can set bushfires in the minds of men that will sweep the globe.
[02:49:35.872 --> 02:49:36.832]  And so these are
[02:49:37.532 --> 02:49:40.194]  Powerful incendiaries in the Infowar.
[02:49:40.194 --> 02:49:48.880]  People need to call you and go to the website TruthAM.com, just TruthAM, like AM Radio, TruthAM.com or call 800-579-0580 after the interview
[02:49:52.782 --> 02:50:00.185]  And we need hams and people that are, it isn't hard to hook up folks, but you know, somebody like me who has problem programming a VCR, I might have a problem.
[02:50:00.185 --> 02:50:04.087]  The point is get it, set it up, get it done, especially people that have a little bit of skill.
[02:50:04.087 --> 02:50:06.548]  Get the unit now, don't wait.
[02:50:06.548 --> 02:50:08.109]  There's only one guy there selling them.
[02:50:08.109 --> 02:50:10.490]  He's selling them basically at cost, because I know what these things cost.
[02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:11.570]  We looked at selling them ourselves.
[02:50:11.570 --> 02:50:11.670]  800-579-0580.
[02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.910]  800-579-0580.
[02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:12.831]  And get the things up this week.
[02:50:21.295 --> 02:50:22.435]  Don't wait, folks.
[02:50:22.435 --> 02:50:23.295]  Go ahead.
[02:50:23.295 --> 02:50:24.116]  One quick point.
[02:50:24.116 --> 02:50:26.317]  We've got 25 of them ready to go.
[02:50:26.317 --> 02:50:29.898]  What happens, the typical thing, people start evaluating these other transmitters.
[02:50:29.898 --> 02:50:31.899]  I did that for two years.
[02:50:31.899 --> 02:50:38.141]  All the kids are going to spend time after time trying to make it work.
[02:50:38.141 --> 02:50:39.222]  These work.
[02:50:39.222 --> 02:50:39.802]  They're ready to go.
[02:50:41.138 --> 02:50:49.909]  Yeah, that's how you found the company that we'd separately found because we were, you know, snooping around trying to find a good AM that was legal to give people.
[02:50:49.909 --> 02:50:56.677]  And all you do is plug it into the internet, folks, or plug it into whatever you want and blast it out and then you've got an audience because you're playing Genesis or whatever.
[02:50:57.578 --> 02:51:04.062]  And then you start getting, or audiophiles, or preachers you like, or you know, whatever it is you want to put out.
[02:51:04.062 --> 02:51:09.545]  And then you've got an audience there in just a few weeks when you put signs up of hundreds, if not thousands, and then boom, you're hitting them.
[02:51:09.545 --> 02:51:11.206]  People want the truth.
[02:51:11.206 --> 02:51:15.608]  But when they find out, what's on those, that AM dial, it's incredible.
[02:51:15.608 --> 02:51:16.168]  Go ahead.
[02:51:16.168 --> 02:51:19.991]  Well, the beauty is, the quality of these is such a high level.
[02:51:19.991 --> 02:51:22.252]  It's such a small box, but when you actually put it on the air,
[02:51:23.133 --> 02:51:33.517]  You're quite astonished yourself, just how well it sounds, and it just sends a shiver up your spine doing that.
[02:51:33.517 --> 02:51:37.359]  Folks are already calling you right now, one of these 25 transmitters.
[02:51:37.359 --> 02:51:40.920]  Look, I want thousands of these to go out.
[02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:42.841]  We'll keep in touch.
[02:51:42.841 --> 02:51:44.541]  All right, yeah, we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[02:51:44.541 --> 02:51:46.342]  I'm going to let you get to those phone calls.
[02:51:46.342 --> 02:51:48.943]  Thank you so much for joining us, Chess.
[02:51:48.943 --> 02:51:49.603]  Good luck to you.
[02:51:49.603 --> 02:51:50.244]  Bye-bye.
[02:51:50.244 --> 02:51:51.184]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:52.757 --> 02:51:56.831]  Again, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com, TruthAM.com!
[02:51:56.831 --> 02:51:58.396]  Get the info war going in your area!
[02:52:01.801 --> 02:52:03.782]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:52:03.782 --> 02:52:10.744]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:52:10.744 --> 02:52:19.127]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:52:19.127 --> 02:52:24.869]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:52:25.029 --> 02:52:26.870]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:29.070]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:52:29.070 --> 02:52:33.592]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:52:33.592 --> 02:52:35.812]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:43.695]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:52:51.239 --> 02:52:53.120]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:53:05.017 --> 02:53:07.641]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:53:07.641 --> 02:53:14.632]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:53:15.231 --> 02:53:21.816]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:53:21.816 --> 02:53:23.798]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:53:23.798 --> 02:53:26.299]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:53:26.299 --> 02:53:37.248]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:53:37.865 --> 02:53:39.525]  It's not about left or right.
[02:53:39.525 --> 02:53:41.386]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:53:41.386 --> 02:53:48.307]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:53:58.129 --> 02:54:02.911]  The people strike back.
[02:54:02.911 --> 02:54:04.851]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:54:05.475 --> 02:54:08.538]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:54:08.538 --> 02:54:12.701]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[02:54:13.484 --> 02:54:15.586]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:54:15.586 --> 02:54:18.989]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:54:18.989 --> 02:54:22.291]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:54:22.291 --> 02:54:34.081]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[02:54:39.906 --> 02:54:40.146]  I think so.
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:38.592]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle has a hole
[02:55:40.831 --> 02:56:02.917]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[02:56:02.917 --> 02:56:04.898]  My sweetest friend
[02:56:07.695 --> 02:56:31.648]  Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down
[02:56:37.677 --> 02:56:39.339]  Go ahead and get Webster Tarpley on, John.
[02:56:39.339 --> 02:56:40.020]  I'm in Minnesota.
[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:44.065]  I've been popping in for about 10 minutes with him.
[02:56:44.065 --> 02:56:45.788]  At the end of the interview, we're going to go to Ireland.
[02:56:45.788 --> 02:56:47.530]  It's just all right here.
[02:56:47.530 --> 02:56:51.335]  Even mainstream news basically admitting it's an inside job.
[02:56:51.335 --> 02:56:54.339]  With them killing the military and police over in Ireland right now.
[02:56:58.518 --> 02:56:59.739]  Oh, it is insane.
[02:56:59.739 --> 02:57:00.780]  We had Ron Paul on today.
[02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:02.081]  An amazing interview.
[02:57:02.081 --> 02:57:05.364]  So many key stories we can write about that and get the word out.
[02:57:05.364 --> 02:57:06.485]  What we do is we have Ron Paul on.
[02:57:06.485 --> 02:57:07.366]  He covers all these issues.
[02:57:07.366 --> 02:57:08.747]  All the Ron Paul supporters.
[02:57:08.747 --> 02:57:10.408]  Then check out the things he covers here.
[02:57:10.408 --> 02:57:13.131]  A lot of things he doesn't get asked by the mainstream media.
[02:57:13.131 --> 02:57:14.512]  And it sends shockwaves out.
[02:57:14.512 --> 02:57:18.656]  You know, that's our job is to set bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:57:18.656 --> 02:57:20.518]  That's why I had TruthAM.com on.
[02:57:22.145 --> 02:57:36.333]  You know, I got all these sponsors, too, and I usually do two, three hours of show and forget about them and then cram them all in here at the end, but it is sponsors that we have a whole other hour coming up, though, that make this show possible.
[02:57:36.333 --> 02:57:38.414]  One of them is PMemory.net.
[02:57:38.414 --> 02:57:39.515]  It's a great system.
[02:57:39.515 --> 02:57:44.158]  It's just the classical systems that really work to increase your memory.
[02:57:45.407 --> 02:57:49.749]  You spend all this time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information can you actually recall?
[02:57:49.749 --> 02:57:51.370]  Test yourself right now.
[02:57:51.370 --> 02:57:55.793]  Try to recall the show aired one week ago.
[02:57:55.793 --> 02:57:58.694]  How about two weeks ago?
[02:57:58.694 --> 02:58:02.516]  And if you cannot recall it, then what's the point?
[02:58:02.516 --> 02:58:08.399]  School of Phenomenal Memory, pmemory.net.
[02:58:08.399 --> 02:58:13.142]  And, you know, I focus all day researching documents and information, and it made my memory even better over the years.
[02:58:17.093 --> 02:58:18.975]  Proven results from the lesson.
[02:58:18.975 --> 02:58:21.017]  Guaranteed no gimmicks or magic pills.
[02:58:21.017 --> 02:58:23.139]  Pure science and real training that makes sense.
[02:58:23.139 --> 02:58:28.384]  Memorize what you read, what you really need, such as daily tasks, new languages, and even entire books.
[02:58:28.384 --> 02:58:31.267]  Dramatically improve natural memory, attention, and thinking speed.
[02:58:31.267 --> 02:58:33.229]  The School of Phenomenal Memory.
[02:58:33.229 --> 02:58:33.930]  www.pmemory.net
[02:58:39.491 --> 02:58:40.812]  Also, another fine sponsor.
[02:58:40.812 --> 02:58:42.054]  I mean, what do I say about this company?
[02:58:42.054 --> 02:58:44.976]  Ecolablue, Ecolablue.com.
[02:58:44.976 --> 02:58:52.444]  Great atmospheric water generator, seven and a half gallons a day, out of the air, inside your house, or out on the porch, whatever, it grabs it, puts it through seven different filters.
[02:58:54.022 --> 02:59:13.313]  And then among the filters is UV, charcoal, reverse osmosis, other filters, no chemicals, pollutants or toxins, neutral pH, your own source of clean drinking water, hook it up to a little solar panel, another great system, acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-L-E-B-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, big banners up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com or call toll free, 800-691-6043, 800.

[02:59:46.374 --> 02:59:51.077]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:51.077 --> 02:59:52.779]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:59:52.779 --> 02:59:57.522]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:59:57.522 --> 03:00:00.484]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:00:00.484 --> 03:00:03.526]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:00:03.526 --> 03:00:08.250]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:00:08.470 --> 03:00:09.590]  If you simply prepare.
[03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:12.832]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:00:12.832 --> 03:00:19.835]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:00:19.835 --> 03:00:23.096]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:00:23.096 --> 03:00:23.356]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[03:00:38.281 --> 03:00:39.641]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:00:39.641 --> 03:00:40.261]  Take action today.
[03:00:40.261 --> 03:00:42.082]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:00:54.099 --> 03:00:56.482]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:56.482 --> 03:00:59.204]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:01:18.909 --> 03:01:24.371]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, in defense of the republic you have found at the tip of the spear in the Info War.
[03:01:24.371 --> 03:01:29.052]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:01:29.052 --> 03:01:29.612]  to 3 p.m.
[03:01:29.612 --> 03:01:32.993]  by the grace of God.
[03:01:32.993 --> 03:01:39.756]  We have told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but that truth.
[03:01:39.756 --> 03:01:46.898]  The Obama deception, I am very, very tempted to go ahead and release it and not wait till Sunday because time is short.
[03:01:49.622 --> 03:01:54.047]  The dirty tricks going on against us are legion.
[03:01:54.047 --> 03:01:57.571]  And that tells me that we are very close to victory.
[03:01:57.571 --> 03:01:58.332]  I smell victory.
[03:02:00.271 --> 03:02:06.434]  Webster Tarpley, he wrote an article about Obamaville, more and more tent cities sprouting up.
[03:02:06.434 --> 03:02:23.920]  He is now announcing that they will take the core of these millions of volunteers and have them march around door-to-door, canvassing support for Obama and his agenda, literally pushing for an open world government run for and by the central banks, a new special court they run where they will try people like Bernie Madoff, a new private banking court.
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:24.681]  It's all happening!
[03:02:25.589 --> 03:02:31.071]  Right now, I'm sure you've noticed, I keep saying this every day, every week, but now it's becoming more and more insane by the minute.
[03:02:31.071 --> 03:02:35.273]  We have so many people waking up right now, so many people listening.
[03:02:35.273 --> 03:02:36.993]  It's the majority of those we're able to reach.
[03:02:36.993 --> 03:02:38.914]  The question is, how do we reach people?
[03:02:38.914 --> 03:02:41.815]  The listeners have to get your books and my films and materials out to folks.
[03:02:44.713 --> 03:02:51.157]  But to go directly over the target and all the flack is also extremely daunting.
[03:02:51.157 --> 03:02:54.579]  Webster Tarpley, it's good to have you here with us.
[03:02:54.579 --> 03:02:55.580]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[03:02:55.580 --> 03:03:01.404]  I am just blown away by how real all of this is.
[03:03:01.404 --> 03:03:05.786]  Just all of the corruption manifesting, the controlled depression, all of it.
[03:03:05.786 --> 03:03:09.629]  Give us the latest on your analysis of what the globalists are doing and what Obama's up to.
[03:03:10.816 --> 03:03:15.020]  Well, I think there are a number of things that are changing rapidly.
[03:03:15.020 --> 03:03:17.442]  The first is this question of the Obamavilles.
[03:03:17.442 --> 03:03:21.025]  And I say Obamavilles very deliberately.
[03:03:21.025 --> 03:03:31.814]  Back in the 1890s in this country, we had a very severe depression, which occurred when President Grover Cleveland, remember him, a Democrat, capitulated to J.P.
[03:03:31.814 --> 03:03:35.678]  Morgan and the British and basically turned the control of the U.S.
[03:03:35.678 --> 03:03:36.919]  public debt over to London.
[03:03:37.443 --> 03:03:40.125]  And their man, Morgan, in Wall Street.
[03:03:40.125 --> 03:03:44.308]  That is really the basis of the Federal Reserve, comes out of that, those events in 1895.
[03:03:44.308 --> 03:03:47.050]  That pitched the entire U.S.
[03:03:47.050 --> 03:03:54.316]  economy into a terrible depression, and there were bread lines for people who were lucky, and those were called Cleveland Cafes.
[03:03:54.316 --> 03:03:56.738]  So, a Cleveland Cafe in the 1890s.
[03:03:56.738 --> 03:04:06.205]  In the 1930s, I think more people remember, there were these shantytowns that were known as Hoovervilles, in honor of Herbert Hoover, reactionary
[03:04:06.693 --> 03:04:17.376]  Republican who refused to do anything about the depression, kept talking about the laws of the free market and how you had to wait and prosperity was just around the corner, and be a rugged individualist.
[03:04:17.376 --> 03:04:20.457]  That was his slogan in 1932 when he lost the election.
[03:04:20.457 --> 03:04:23.198]  So those were Herbert Hoover, Hoovervilles.
[03:04:23.198 --> 03:04:28.979]  And now we have these shantytowns, and I don't know what else you're going to call them except Obamavilles, because that's what they are.
[03:04:28.979 --> 03:04:32.720]  And they're filling up with people who are homeless.
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:34.381]  And we can see
[03:04:35.310 --> 03:04:37.151]  Just the beginnings of some coverage.
[03:04:37.151 --> 03:04:42.233]  NBC News had a story last night in their nightly news about these shanty towns.
[03:04:42.233 --> 03:04:44.234]  They don't call them Obamavilles, of course.
[03:04:44.234 --> 03:04:45.394]  The BBC's done it.
[03:04:45.394 --> 03:04:48.436]  Local California, Michigan, Florida News is doing it.
[03:04:48.436 --> 03:04:58.140]  And what's happening is these are the working poor who lost their little house, who've lost their job, who can't get credit to even get into a small apartment, and these are cling-clut, you know,
[03:04:58.780 --> 03:05:00.761]  Well, I recommend for this stopping foreclosures.
[03:05:00.761 --> 03:05:04.763]  And the way you stop foreclosures is to stop foreclosures with a federal law.
[03:05:04.763 --> 03:05:06.164]  Foreclosure must be a federal crime.
[03:05:06.164 --> 03:05:06.624]  No foreclosures.
[03:05:28.649 --> 03:05:32.511]  We've got a banking sector that has run wild for 20 years under deregulation.
[03:05:32.511 --> 03:05:36.313]  Yeah, Bloomberg reported the banks have gotten 9.7 trillion.
[03:05:36.313 --> 03:05:42.275]  It's unaccounted for and that would pay for 90 plus percent of all mortgages.
[03:05:42.275 --> 03:05:45.897]  It would be a pittance of that with the people that can prove that they can't pay their mortgages.
[03:05:45.897 --> 03:05:47.218]  It is socialism.
[03:05:47.218 --> 03:05:50.860]  They keep saying that we've got socialism, but we really don't have that.
[03:05:50.860 --> 03:05:52.880]  We have banker-looting fascism.
[03:05:52.880 --> 03:05:56.982]  And if I have a choice between banker-looting fascism and socialism, I'll take socialism.
[03:05:56.982 --> 03:05:57.863]  That's not what we're getting.
[03:06:01.681 --> 03:06:07.628]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:06:07.628 --> 03:06:12.654]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:06:12.654 --> 03:06:17.861]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:06:17.861 --> 03:06:21.245]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:06:21.765 --> 03:06:30.290]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:06:30.290 --> 03:06:36.073]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:06:36.073 --> 03:06:42.056]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:06:42.056 --> 03:06:44.377]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[03:06:44.657 --> 03:06:47.318]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?
[03:06:47.318 --> 03:06:53.060]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:06:53.060 --> 03:06:55.561]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[03:06:55.561 --> 03:06:57.021]  Or call 269-344-3420 today!
[03:06:57.021 --> 03:06:59.422]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[03:07:05.157 --> 03:07:07.782]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:07:07.782 --> 03:07:14.816]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:07:15.350 --> 03:07:21.914]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:07:21.914 --> 03:07:23.915]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:07:23.915 --> 03:07:26.416]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:07:26.416 --> 03:07:37.382]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:07:37.981 --> 03:07:39.643]  It's not about left or right.
[03:07:39.643 --> 03:07:41.505]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:07:41.505 --> 03:07:48.432]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:07:48.432 --> 03:07:56.701]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:56.701 --> 03:07:58.262]  The Obama Deception.
[03:07:58.262 --> 03:07:59.444]  The people strike back.
[03:08:01.377 --> 03:08:02.739]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[03:08:02.739 --> 03:08:05.163]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:08:05.163 --> 03:08:09.329]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:08:09.329 --> 03:08:11.613]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't
[03:08:16.646 --> 03:08:25.471]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:08:25.471 --> 03:08:31.854]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:08:31.854 --> 03:08:35.455]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[03:08:35.455 --> 03:08:39.857]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:08:39.857 --> 03:08:40.958]  For the rest of you, go to
[03:08:47.799 --> 03:08:48.320]  We're good to go.
[03:09:23.619 --> 03:09:26.981]  Webster Tarpley is our guest, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[03:09:26.981 --> 03:09:32.604]  Tarpley will be on with us at the same time, because he's very educated on all these subjects.
[03:09:32.604 --> 03:09:43.791]  Even the mainstream news is admitting, just like the shooting a week ago of the cricket team over in Pakistan, it was on surveillance cameras, witnesses saw it, the police just stood there.
[03:09:44.798 --> 03:09:47.860]  The shooters walked right past them with their guns.
[03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:49.781]  They were allowed to do that.
[03:09:49.781 --> 03:09:51.502]  Mainstream news, scores of headlines.
[03:09:51.502 --> 03:09:57.586]  We posted them up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and an article Steve Watson wrote.
[03:09:57.586 --> 03:10:00.148]  Inside job in cricket shooting goes viral.
[03:10:01.778 --> 03:10:04.560]  And so now people are aware of that.
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:13.328]  Also, with the thing in Northern Ireland, we said, let's see if there was a drill going on at that time, and let's see if the security forces didn't shoot back and stood down.
[03:10:13.328 --> 03:10:14.989]  It's now come out today.
[03:10:14.989 --> 03:10:19.773]  It's in major British papers and Irish papers and European papers, and we're going to go over that.
[03:10:19.773 --> 03:10:22.736]  Webster, digressing, and we'll go back to the Obama bills, just to
[03:10:23.396 --> 03:10:31.083]  Well, I'm not very familiar with the details of all this because I've been paying attention to economics, but what we do know is that the British government of Gordon Brown has tremendous totalitarian
[03:10:47.381 --> 03:10:48.582]  We're good to go.
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:15.860]  That's right.
[03:11:38.607 --> 03:11:41.989]  And you can see that Gordon Brown is making policy.
[03:11:41.989 --> 03:11:44.111]  Gordon Brown was here in Washington last week.
[03:11:44.111 --> 03:11:48.854]  He addressed a joint session of the Congress, and he's a big supporter of free trade.
[03:11:48.854 --> 03:11:53.376]  Oh, he's telling about the free market and the free trade, and how great that is.
[03:11:53.376 --> 03:12:02.342]  And of course, Obama is embarrassed by Gordon Brown, because it's clear that Obama is basically following orders from Gordon Brown.
[03:12:02.342 --> 03:12:06.805]  So you may have heard some of the right-wing talk show hosts make a big deal about how
[03:12:07.612 --> 03:12:12.854]  Uh, Gordon Brown was snubbed by Obama, and I think this is essentially baseless.
[03:12:12.854 --> 03:12:15.335]  This was a little bit of a dog-and-pony show, right?
[03:12:15.335 --> 03:12:22.838]  That they kind of did a charade to make it look like Obama was not working directly for Gordon Brown, but I think he is.
[03:12:22.838 --> 03:12:29.641]  Gordon Brown also wants $500 billion for the International Monetary Fund.
[03:12:29.641 --> 03:12:33.162]  Now, if you want to have the New World Order, that's it.
[03:12:33.162 --> 03:12:34.823]  Whatever the New World Order is going to be,
[03:12:35.416 --> 03:12:38.398]  It's going to be centered in the International Monetary Fund.
[03:12:38.398 --> 03:12:44.382]  Well, they've said that they're making their own court for Madoff and others that the bankers will run because they're the experts.
[03:12:44.382 --> 03:12:48.345]  And it'll be a new bank of the world that you pay your carbon taxes to.
[03:12:48.345 --> 03:12:49.866]  That's now all over the news.
[03:12:49.866 --> 03:12:51.207]  I mean, more and more every day.
[03:12:51.207 --> 03:12:53.969]  I mean, it's here.
[03:12:53.969 --> 03:12:58.352]  They've called the Wall Street Journal for a North American Union to save us out of the crisis.
[03:12:58.352 --> 03:12:59.333]  So you're absolutely right.
[03:12:59.775 --> 03:13:04.177]  Yeah, the International Monetary Fund is what's going to cap this entire thing.
[03:13:04.177 --> 03:13:07.939]  It'll be the apex of the entire edifice.
[03:13:07.939 --> 03:13:14.243]  And right now they want more money for bankrupt speculators in Eastern Europe and so forth.
[03:13:14.243 --> 03:13:18.445]  I think it's also important to look at the evolution of the derivatives.
[03:13:18.445 --> 03:13:21.467]  My view of the crisis, of course, is that it's totally out of control.
[03:13:21.467 --> 03:13:26.970]  That nobody controls this crisis because it's bringing down all of their institutions one after another.
[03:13:27.966 --> 03:13:37.754]  Last week we had the big AIG story, right, that AIG had lost $62 billion in one quarter, and of course that's all derivative.
[03:13:37.754 --> 03:13:48.583]  This is a very important example, because it refutes the story that you hear from Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Hannity, and all the rest of these clowns, that the crisis was created by poor people
[03:13:49.116 --> 03:13:50.437]  Getting subprime mortgages.
[03:13:50.437 --> 03:13:56.260]  Well, that was publicly the cover story to get the bailout, but the bill said it was for derivatives.
[03:13:56.260 --> 03:14:03.844]  Now in the multi-trillions and growing, just in the United States, not to count worldwide, so it's on record that it is the bankers' derivatives.
[03:14:03.844 --> 03:14:09.127]  But yes, they want to blame it on the American people, so we feel like we have indebtedness to go along with this.
[03:14:09.127 --> 03:14:09.488]  Right.
[03:14:09.488 --> 03:14:13.650]  And AIG has now taken, they've gotten $160 billion already.
[03:14:13.650 --> 03:14:16.131]  They're going to get another $30 billion immediately.
[03:14:16.131 --> 03:14:18.673]  Another $200 billion on top of that, just for AIG.
[03:14:19.195 --> 03:14:21.256]  Now, this is an insurance company.
[03:14:21.256 --> 03:14:33.321]  The interesting thing that came up in the hearings here last week in the Dodd-Shelby Senate Banking Committee and also the Wyden Committee, the Senate Budget Committee, who got that money?
[03:14:33.321 --> 03:14:45.007]  It turns out that the money given to AIG was then passed along to European banks, European derivatives merchants, foreign bankers got that money, and of course, Goldman Sachs.
[03:14:45.007 --> 03:14:47.848]  Now, the fact that Goldman Sachs got all that money through AIG
[03:14:48.507 --> 03:15:03.773]  ...opens up Hanky Panky Paulson, Henry Paulson, the former Secretary of the Treasury, under Bush, of course, whose entire wealth was wrapped up in options and other instruments and benefits that he had from Goldman Sachs, which is what he worked for.
[03:15:03.773 --> 03:15:08.495]  Now, the big thing is, the derivatives scandal, I think, is about to explode.
[03:15:08.495 --> 03:15:14.558]  Today in the Washington Post, we have an article by a guy called Smick, where he says the derivatives problem is a black hole.
[03:15:15.089 --> 03:15:22.813]  And the reason that Geithner can't come forward with any programs is because it's going to take trillions, at least 2 to 3 trillion.
[03:15:22.813 --> 03:15:29.536]  And everybody in the Obama administration is afraid to come forward and say, we want 2 trillion or 3 trillion.
[03:15:29.536 --> 03:15:34.078]  And by the way, that's what Larry Summers is coming out and saying from the White House.
[03:15:34.078 --> 03:15:36.019]  He's saying we need trillions more.
[03:15:36.019 --> 03:15:37.459]  That's in the news today.
[03:15:37.459 --> 03:15:37.900]  Absolutely.
[03:15:37.900 --> 03:15:38.940]  Well, that's very interesting.
[03:15:38.940 --> 03:15:41.301]  I think that the dam is breaking on this question.
[03:15:41.301 --> 03:15:43.202]  See, for the average person, the big issue is,
[03:15:43.678 --> 03:15:45.459]  What caused the depression?
[03:15:45.459 --> 03:15:46.800]  Why is there a depression?
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:48.041]  Why should there be a depression?
[03:15:48.041 --> 03:15:48.902]  What has changed?
[03:15:48.902 --> 03:15:53.225]  Well, the big difference is we have 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives.
[03:15:53.717 --> 03:15:58.439]  The leverage on that used to be positive, which meant super profits at the apex of the period.
[03:15:58.439 --> 03:16:03.302]  Yeah, they built Ponzi schemes, and now they've imploded, and if they can get us to sign on, they'll take over.
[03:16:03.302 --> 03:16:06.763]  But if they don't, it'll come out, they wreck the economy, and they all go to prison.
[03:16:06.763 --> 03:16:12.626]  I had Ron Paul calling for their indictments of these bank heads earlier in the show, so you're absolutely right.
[03:16:12.626 --> 03:16:15.548]  Well, it's going to take something more, and this is what I recommend.
[03:16:15.548 --> 03:16:17.829]  When it comes to derivatives, there's only one policy.
[03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:19.130]  Wipe them out.
[03:16:19.130 --> 03:16:20.150]  Destroy them.
[03:16:20.150 --> 03:16:20.971]  Shred them.
[03:16:20.971 --> 03:16:22.112]  Delete them.
[03:16:22.112 --> 03:16:23.313]  Burn them.
[03:16:23.313 --> 03:16:24.433]  Make them into wallpaper.
[03:16:24.433 --> 03:16:24.974]  Freeze them.
[03:16:24.974 --> 03:16:27.135]  Freeze them is the best.
[03:16:27.135 --> 03:16:30.017]  Well, I think you've got to get them out of the universe.
[03:16:30.017 --> 03:16:39.863]  And that's the problem with this guy Schmick, is he realizes that derivatives are a black hole, but you can't... And they won't even ban... They won't even... I had a top economist on the last two weeks.
[03:16:39.863 --> 03:16:41.885]  They won't even ban naked short selling.
[03:16:43.069 --> 03:16:46.430]  Well, that may be coming, but anyway, that doesn't stop us.
[03:16:46.430 --> 03:16:56.512]  Our demand has to be, and this is really a matter of economic science, if you want to get out of the Depression, there's only one way to do it, and it's got to be done by government, because nobody else can do it.
[03:16:56.512 --> 03:16:57.872]  Ban derivatives.
[03:16:57.872 --> 03:16:59.813]  Derivatives were illegal.
[03:16:59.813 --> 03:17:10.155]  From 1936 and the New Deal until 1982, when Reagan came in under the influence of Milton Friedman and the rest of these people, derivatives were illegal.
[03:17:10.155 --> 03:17:10.555]  And from 1982 until 1993,
[03:17:12.987 --> 03:17:15.468]  They were a very, very dubious legality.
[03:17:15.468 --> 03:17:19.788]  Nobody was willing to buy them, because there was still this idea that they might be illegal.
[03:17:19.788 --> 03:17:28.490]  But then they used AIG to AAA certify them as an insurance company, and so they labeled literal buckets of crap as gold.
[03:17:28.490 --> 03:17:29.710]  Right, and this was done in 1993.
[03:17:29.710 --> 03:17:34.731]  It's Wendy Graham, the wife of Phil Graham.
[03:17:34.731 --> 03:17:37.812]  She came in and said, I'm going to make a safe haven for derivatives.
[03:17:37.812 --> 03:17:40.853]  She was backed up by Bob Rubin of Goldman Sachs,
[03:17:42.466 --> 03:17:47.748]  Summers, the same guy that we have today, also by Greenspan, of course.
[03:17:47.748 --> 03:17:58.053]  And then Phil Graham of Texas came in at the end of the 90s with a law that was signed by Clinton, guaranteeing that derivatives were hunky-dory, and that's basically how it happened.
[03:17:58.053 --> 03:18:03.975]  But even under the laws they changed, they violated federal laws and international laws tens of thousands of times.
[03:18:03.975 --> 03:18:04.975]  That's on record.
[03:18:04.975 --> 03:18:10.478]  They didn't even follow their own scam rules, and that's why we should have state grand juries move their indictments.
[03:18:11.263 --> 03:18:15.987]  Well, again, you can put all these people in jail, but you've got to get rid of 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives.
[03:18:15.987 --> 03:18:16.467]  The U.S.
[03:18:16.467 --> 03:18:18.649]  part is about a quadrillion.
[03:18:18.649 --> 03:18:20.951]  Well, Webster, we have to put them in jail!
[03:18:20.951 --> 03:18:30.458]  We have to put them in jail, because they're going to expand us into an even bigger Ponzi scheme of world government, foreign by the bankers, if we don't identify them as the crooks!
[03:18:30.458 --> 03:18:33.060]  I'm all for it, but you've got to destroy the derivatives.
[03:18:33.060 --> 03:18:38.064]  The re-regulation of markets is what you need, and that means wipe out derivatives.
[03:18:38.064 --> 03:18:40.426]  In other words, not just re-regulate looking forward,
[03:18:40.782 --> 03:18:45.603]  But re-regulate looking backward and declare that all of this stuff goes into the shredder.
[03:18:45.603 --> 03:18:46.504]  It gets deleted.
[03:18:46.504 --> 03:18:49.965]  You press the delete button and 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives are gone.
[03:18:49.965 --> 03:18:54.486]  Because there's no way, as you and other economists and historians have proven, no way to fix this.
[03:18:54.486 --> 03:18:56.926]  It's a black hole that will consume everything.
[03:18:56.926 --> 03:18:58.127]  Look, we did the banker bailout bill.
[03:18:58.127 --> 03:18:59.027]  We did all this.
[03:18:59.027 --> 03:18:59.987]  And look, it only gets worse.
[03:18:59.987 --> 03:19:01.868]  The stock market's still plunging.
[03:19:01.868 --> 03:19:06.889]  This is why they say, how come Obama doesn't come forward with a solution for the banks?
[03:19:06.889 --> 03:19:10.030]  Well, there is no solution for the banks unless you destroy
[03:19:10.526 --> 03:19:11.687]  Derivatives.
[03:19:11.687 --> 03:19:13.568]  The whole thing hinges on derivatives.
[03:19:13.568 --> 03:19:15.989]  And this has become more and more obvious to people.
[03:19:15.989 --> 03:19:22.072]  How come Paulson had to revamp the TARP from the first TARP to what it then became?
[03:19:22.072 --> 03:19:25.194]  How come Geithner can't give you any details?
[03:19:25.194 --> 03:19:27.755]  Why are they waiting week after week, day after day?
[03:19:27.755 --> 03:19:30.957]  Citibank is now hovering at about a dollar a share.
[03:19:30.957 --> 03:19:34.479]  There's a little bit of a pop today, but I don't even think it'll last the day.
[03:19:34.479 --> 03:19:36.680]  AIG is 38 cents a share.
[03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:37.921]  This is all derivatives.
[03:19:38.223 --> 03:19:57.771]  There's an article today in McClatchy, very interesting, that if you take the five top banks, Citibank, JP Morgan, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, they have more than enough derivatives losses to wipe out their entire capital base, meaning those are all zombie banks.
[03:19:57.771 --> 03:19:59.091]  Now, it's quite obvious.
[03:19:59.091 --> 03:20:03.273]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, under this crazy Sheila Bear,
[03:20:04.062 --> 03:20:05.822]  They have to seize those banks.
[03:20:05.822 --> 03:20:13.505]  Banks are seized in the United States basically every Friday now, but mostly they're little banks in out-of-the-way places.
[03:20:13.505 --> 03:20:23.307]  This time around, the big money-setter banks, the big five, have got to be seized and put through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and in the process, wipe out the derivatives.
[03:20:23.307 --> 03:20:25.048]  Those five banks represent 95%
[03:20:26.798 --> 03:20:29.100]  Of the entire derivatives bubble on the U.S.
[03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:29.440]  side.
[03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:30.981]  So that would be a way to begin.
[03:20:30.981 --> 03:20:38.947]  And then once we arrest their directors, we can bring them into court and find out the full extent of the Ponzi schemes and then arrest all the rest of them.
[03:20:38.947 --> 03:20:39.527]  Absolutely.
[03:20:39.527 --> 03:20:40.948]  There's no way around it.
[03:20:40.948 --> 03:20:48.654]  We can wake up next week and arrest all these people and the New World Order can end, folks, but the churches are telling you it's impossible, it's up to God, it's going to happen.
[03:20:48.654 --> 03:20:50.035]  That is mind control.
[03:20:50.035 --> 03:20:54.418]  You have to believe we can beat them because we don't have any other hope but to have these people through
[03:20:55.399 --> 03:20:57.000]  Due process.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:57.941]  Arrested.
[03:20:57.941 --> 03:20:59.562]  Seized immediately.
[03:20:59.562 --> 03:21:02.323]  Seize the criminals.
[03:21:02.323 --> 03:21:07.567]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.371 --> 03:21:14.234]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.234 --> 03:21:20.736]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.736 --> 03:21:22.717]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.717 --> 03:21:25.178]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.178 --> 03:21:36.063]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.354 --> 03:21:40.015]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:40.015 --> 03:21:41.876]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.876 --> 03:21:48.801]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:57.046 --> 03:21:58.627]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.627 --> 03:21:59.808]  The people strike back.
[03:22:02.233 --> 03:22:06.815]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[03:22:06.815 --> 03:22:19.161]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[03:22:19.161 --> 03:22:24.744]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[03:22:24.744 --> 03:22:26.185]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[03:22:26.733 --> 03:22:32.732]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[03:22:33.402 --> 03:22:37.725]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[03:22:37.725 --> 03:22:38.505]  Give me a call.

[03:22:42.968 --> 03:22:47.271]  And allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[03:22:47.271 --> 03:22:49.072]  That's Peter Kronschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:22:49.072 --> 03:22:53.295]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[03:23:01.611 --> 03:23:06.177]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[03:23:06.177 --> 03:23:09.061]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?

[03:24:01.420 --> 03:24:06.321]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[03:24:06.321 --> 03:24:13.763]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[03:24:13.763 --> 03:24:15.383]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[03:24:15.383 --> 03:24:19.544]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[03:24:19.544 --> 03:24:23.365]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[03:24:23.365 --> 03:24:27.845]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[03:24:27.845 --> 03:24:30.486]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently
[03:24:30.486 --> 03:24:30.926]  We're good to go.
[03:24:59.918 --> 03:25:02.419]  Federal Agents!
[03:25:02.419 --> 03:25:04.320]  We are armed!
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:09.543]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[03:25:09.543 --> 03:25:12.264]  Would you stand up for true?
[03:25:12.264 --> 03:25:14.906]  Or would you turn away too?
[03:25:14.906 --> 03:25:19.668]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[03:25:19.668 --> 03:25:22.689]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[03:25:22.689 --> 03:25:25.991]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[03:25:25.991 --> 03:25:29.473]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[03:25:30.735 --> 03:25:34.878]  They're telling me about Osama over there.
[03:25:34.878 --> 03:25:40.462]  Listen to the suckers.
[03:25:40.462 --> 03:25:42.023]  God, we've got criminals in control.
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:48.262]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[03:25:48.262 --> 03:25:51.123]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[03:25:51.123 --> 03:25:53.424]  They're warning me about Osama or whatever.
[03:25:53.424 --> 03:25:55.145]  Picture me buying this scam.
[03:25:55.145 --> 03:25:56.346]  I said never.
[03:25:56.346 --> 03:25:59.007]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[03:25:59.007 --> 03:26:00.248]  I stay committed, give up.
[03:26:00.248 --> 03:26:01.628]  If I die, I lose commission.
[03:26:01.628 --> 03:26:04.650]  It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control and all about
[03:26:04.970 --> 03:26:07.052]  Let's go back to Webster Tarpley.
[03:26:07.052 --> 03:26:08.633]  Webster, you're going over the economy.
[03:26:08.633 --> 03:26:10.195]  I agree with you about what's happening.
[03:26:10.195 --> 03:26:10.735]  Please continue.
[03:26:10.735 --> 03:26:14.518]  It's good to see Obama's approval rating dropping between 15 and 20 points.
[03:26:29.295 --> 03:26:31.936]  His first couple hundred days trying to ram everything through.
[03:26:31.936 --> 03:26:34.096]  It looks like things are going well.
[03:26:34.096 --> 03:26:35.937]  We're still in a dire situation.
[03:26:35.937 --> 03:26:36.537]  Exposing him.
[03:26:36.537 --> 03:26:39.858]  People, what, got to intensify their operation to expose it?
[03:26:39.858 --> 03:26:45.119]  Yes, and I think it's wonderful that you're taking the lead with the Obama deception.
[03:26:45.119 --> 03:26:48.380]  It goes right to the heart of Obama.
[03:26:48.380 --> 03:26:52.861]  With Bush, of course, you were dealing with a pretty open reactionary, right?
[03:26:52.861 --> 03:26:57.542]  He would go around and say things like, bring it on, and wanted debtor alive, and so forth.
[03:26:57.978 --> 03:27:04.784]  Obama's a completely different proposition, and as you point out, it's deception, dissembling deception, duping people.
[03:27:04.784 --> 03:27:08.688]  The guy is slippery, slimy, he's evasive.
[03:27:08.688 --> 03:27:14.473]  So the question of deception, I think, is really critical, and it sounds to me like you've assembled a number of voices.
[03:27:15.160 --> 03:27:16.421]  In the Obama deception.
[03:27:16.421 --> 03:27:20.103]  Well, you haven't seen it yet, but you're the number one voice in the film.
[03:27:20.103 --> 03:27:24.206]  Gerald Celente, George Humphrey, K.R.S.
[03:27:24.206 --> 03:27:35.893]  One, Professor Griff, myself, but it's really Obama showing him, say, one thing, and then a year later doing the opposite, saying he's shutting down camps when he actually is expanding it.
[03:27:35.893 --> 03:27:38.154]  I mean, it's going to be devastating to him.
[03:27:39.395 --> 03:27:42.937]  Today, Obama wants to bust the teachers union.
[03:27:42.937 --> 03:27:45.519]  He just came out with a big thing for merit pay.
[03:27:45.519 --> 03:27:47.080]  It's the equivalent of piecework, right?
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:51.062]  If you ever worked in a factory with piecework, you know how difficult that is.
[03:27:51.062 --> 03:27:53.904]  Obama wants to have the equivalent of piecework for teachers.
[03:27:53.904 --> 03:27:56.886]  It's a way to bust the American Federation of Teachers.
[03:27:56.886 --> 03:27:57.667]  Poor dupes.
[03:27:57.667 --> 03:27:58.907]  They supported him.
[03:27:58.907 --> 03:28:00.749]  He's going to stab them in the back.
[03:28:00.749 --> 03:28:04.031]  Obama says he wants to help people who are going to get foreclosed on.
[03:28:04.031 --> 03:28:05.932]  His answer to that is to increase payments.
[03:28:06.380 --> 03:28:08.361]  To these predators like Mozilla, right?
[03:28:08.361 --> 03:28:10.402]  The Mozilla types that countrywide.
[03:28:10.402 --> 03:28:14.463]  The predatory lenders are going to get the money, and maybe somebody might get helped.
[03:28:14.463 --> 03:28:16.104]  But that's not the main idea.
[03:28:16.104 --> 03:28:18.125]  The main idea is to prop up those guys.
[03:28:18.125 --> 03:28:20.586]  So, it's all deception with Obama.
[03:28:20.586 --> 03:28:28.049]  And the main thing, of course, is he's owned by Goldman Sachs, Soros, David Rockefeller, Trilateral Commission.
[03:28:28.049 --> 03:28:35.012]  The foreign policy is a more sophisticated version of imperialism that depends on playing other countries.
[03:28:35.794 --> 03:28:36.535]  One against the other.
[03:28:36.535 --> 03:28:39.197]  Right now they're trying to play Russia against Iran.
[03:28:39.197 --> 03:28:43.861]  They're trying to get Russia to become the leading edge of a U.S.
[03:28:43.861 --> 03:28:49.746]  assault on Iran, really, with the idea that what's going to come out of that is conflict between Iran and Russia, with the U.S.
[03:28:49.746 --> 03:28:50.507]  holding back.
[03:28:50.507 --> 03:29:02.698]  Well, expanding on that, George Soros at the Davis Forum three weeks ago, you may have seen the video, admits they're lowering oil prices as a weapon against Russia, Venezuela, the Middle East, to accelerate the World Depression.
[03:29:03.942 --> 03:29:06.663]  Yes, I'm sure that he would say that.
[03:29:06.663 --> 03:29:11.586]  I think the collapse of oil prices has got a number of things going on.
[03:29:11.586 --> 03:29:14.087]  Some of that is hedge funds approaching bankruptcy.
[03:29:14.087 --> 03:29:17.949]  They go into a liquidation mode and dump their speculative positions.
[03:29:17.949 --> 03:29:21.671]  The other thing, of course, is that demand is shrinking as the Depression hits.
[03:29:21.671 --> 03:29:25.433]  But certainly, they're trying to turn that against Russia.
[03:29:25.433 --> 03:29:27.193]  So that goes on.
[03:29:27.193 --> 03:29:28.194]  Also with Sudan.
[03:29:28.194 --> 03:29:30.435]  Look, the biggest country in Africa.
[03:29:30.942 --> 03:29:34.923]  Right now, you've got this awful woman, Susan Rice, at the United Nations.
[03:29:34.923 --> 03:29:35.944]  AFRICOM!
[03:29:35.944 --> 03:29:37.044]  They're moving U.S.
[03:29:37.044 --> 03:29:40.645]  forces into Africa right now, and they've got a black face to do it.
[03:29:40.645 --> 03:29:43.826]  Yeah, and Sudan is this huge country.
[03:29:43.826 --> 03:29:47.788]  I've actually been there, and you fly from northern Sudan to southern Sudan.
[03:29:47.788 --> 03:29:49.688]  You're going for hours and hours and hours.
[03:29:49.688 --> 03:29:57.451]  It's huge, and it's the key to Africa in many ways, and they're sending China about 6, 7, 8 percent of Chinese oil.
[03:29:58.098 --> 03:30:02.121]  And the goal now is to, they've declared the President an outlaw, right?
[03:30:02.121 --> 03:30:04.923]  Bashir, they want to make him into a criminal.
[03:30:04.923 --> 03:30:06.304]  Yeah, we now have the U.N.
[03:30:06.304 --> 03:30:08.665]  and they made it liberal cause celeb to do this.
[03:30:08.665 --> 03:30:09.906]  We're not saying the guy's perfect.
[03:30:09.906 --> 03:30:15.170]  The point is, they've made, he's the first sitting President that the U.N.
[03:30:15.170 --> 03:30:16.691]  has indicted.
[03:30:16.691 --> 03:30:22.875]  And that they have a proposal for a no-fly zone over Sudan, which would simply mean that the U.S.
[03:30:22.875 --> 03:30:24.717]  Air Force would then try to shoot down
[03:30:25.436 --> 03:30:26.957]  All flights over Sudan.
[03:30:26.957 --> 03:30:28.418]  Now, that's a wonderful thing.
[03:30:28.418 --> 03:30:31.039]  Let's bring war to another continent.
[03:30:31.039 --> 03:30:34.501]  Let's have Africa in flames in addition to the Middle East in flames.
[03:30:34.501 --> 03:30:38.042]  And the vector point is Sudan for the NORTHCOM invasion.
[03:30:38.042 --> 03:30:38.323]  U.S.
[03:30:38.323 --> 03:30:44.706]  forces mashing all over the continent of Africa with smiling Obama leading the way.
[03:30:44.706 --> 03:30:45.686]  Stay there, Webster Tarble.
[03:30:45.686 --> 03:30:51.769]  We'll come back and continue with the real agenda and the Obama deception at InfoWars.com.
[03:30:51.769 --> 03:30:53.170]  We're on the march.
[03:30:53.170 --> 03:30:54.671]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:55.701 --> 03:30:58.388]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:32:02.264 --> 03:32:08.087]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:32:08.087 --> 03:32:15.130]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:32:15.660 --> 03:32:22.247]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:32:22.247 --> 03:32:24.209]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:32:24.209 --> 03:32:26.712]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:32:26.712 --> 03:32:37.704]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:32:38.288 --> 03:32:39.949]  It's not about left or right.
[03:32:39.949 --> 03:32:41.810]  It's about a one world government.
[03:32:41.810 --> 03:32:48.712]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:32:58.556 --> 03:32:59.757]  The people strike back.
[03:33:01.690 --> 03:33:05.393]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:33:05.393 --> 03:33:11.138]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:33:11.138 --> 03:33:15.482]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:33:15.482 --> 03:33:17.944]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[03:33:17.944 --> 03:33:29.053]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.
[03:33:29.293 --> 03:33:38.000]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds by size and weight, keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:41.363]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[03:33:41.363 --> 03:33:43.384]  Nature's Jam Golden Flax is pure.

[03:34:33.570 --> 03:34:40.395]  I will tell everybody out there listening that we may launch the Obama Deception early today or tomorrow.
[03:34:40.395 --> 03:34:44.237]  It is too vital to wait at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:34:47.856 --> 03:34:49.878]  I was out of the studio during the break.
[03:34:49.878 --> 03:34:54.401]  John, do we have our next guest on from We Are Change Ireland, Keith Bryan?
[03:34:54.401 --> 03:35:02.167]  We're going to go to him in a moment.
[03:35:02.167 --> 03:35:03.028]  Webster Tarpley.
[03:35:07.099 --> 03:35:10.721]  Again, I want to get back to how to defeat these people.
[03:35:10.721 --> 03:35:15.003]  They are now announcing what they had currently and previously said they were going to do.
[03:35:15.003 --> 03:35:16.304]  Use the Obamanoids.
[03:35:16.304 --> 03:35:19.446]  I have the quotes here in a story Kurt Nemo did out of Mainstream News.
[03:35:20.905 --> 03:35:42.232]  Canvass in and find out, the exact quote is chilling, who supports Obama and who doesn't on a door-by-door basis and pressure people, exactly what you said with these multi-million man goon force, now he's openly admitting, and the Army's admitting, a million person civilian military force, that after the military takes over a country, including the U.S., they're the bureaucracy.
[03:35:42.232 --> 03:35:46.073]  I mean, it's all happening, so how do we defeat this?
[03:35:47.028 --> 03:35:54.392]  Well, as I write in my latest book, which is Surviving the Cataclysm, just published by Progressive Press last week, actually.
[03:35:54.392 --> 03:35:57.413]  First copies of Surviving the Cataclysm now going out.
[03:35:57.413 --> 03:35:59.635]  The main thing is political organizing.
[03:35:59.635 --> 03:36:05.017]  The thing with Obama is an illusion, and it's an illusion which is very fragile.
[03:36:05.017 --> 03:36:10.440]  And I think you can see already the signs that Obama's beginning to get bogged down.
[03:36:10.440 --> 03:36:13.562]  As long as he was running for office, he could make promises 360 degrees.
[03:36:15.939 --> 03:36:18.141]  He promised everything and the opposite of everything.
[03:36:18.141 --> 03:36:24.505]  Once you're in office, you've got to come down and make certain decisions, even though those are hidden, right?
[03:36:24.505 --> 03:36:34.632]  There's a tremendous propaganda effort to hide the fact that the essence of Obama is $10 trillion to the banks, with an unlimited blank check.
[03:36:34.632 --> 03:36:41.978]  If you looked at his State of the Union address, he basically said, we will do anything for the banks.
[03:36:41.978 --> 03:36:43.959]  He doesn't say we will do anything for the homeless.
[03:36:44.446 --> 03:36:47.167]  Or for the auto industry, or for anybody else.
[03:36:47.167 --> 03:36:48.708]  Only the banks.
[03:36:48.708 --> 03:36:54.551]  The more that this can be understood, I think the quicker the illusion of Obama will collapse.
[03:36:54.551 --> 03:36:57.533]  In other words, he can crater very easily.
[03:36:57.533 --> 03:36:59.274]  Because it's all based on hysteria.
[03:36:59.274 --> 03:37:08.859]  You can already see that in the financial community, there are some people who now think more that he's an incompetent, that he's not an effective crisis manager.
[03:37:09.352 --> 03:37:18.660]  You have among the swooning, drooling liberals at the New York Times, people like Maureen Dowd, they're beginning to think that he's maybe not the messiah that they thought.
[03:37:18.660 --> 03:37:21.142]  He might even be a false messiah.
[03:37:21.142 --> 03:37:27.047]  Well, they're already preparing to blame everything on him when he's just a puppet minion.
[03:37:27.047 --> 03:37:28.068]  Here's the quote here.
[03:37:28.068 --> 03:37:35.915]  It says his new organization, Organizing for America, will be going door-to-door to map out and identify support.
[03:37:35.915 --> 03:37:36.736]  To map out.
[03:37:38.021 --> 03:37:44.386]  I mean, his goons are hitting the street and they're trying to sell his financial system and what he's pushing.
[03:37:44.386 --> 03:37:45.828]  Well, don't open the door, right?
[03:37:45.828 --> 03:37:46.809]  Don't let them get there.
[03:37:46.809 --> 03:37:47.929]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:37:47.929 --> 03:37:51.292]  Open the door and give them an Obama deception.
[03:37:51.292 --> 03:37:52.814]  Yes, if you have one.
[03:37:52.814 --> 03:37:53.074]  Sure.
[03:37:53.516 --> 03:37:54.036]  That's great.
[03:37:54.036 --> 03:37:54.956]  Counter-organize them.
[03:37:54.956 --> 03:37:56.157]  That's better.
[03:37:56.157 --> 03:37:56.977]  Counter-organize them.
[03:37:56.977 --> 03:37:59.197]  Shouldn't we go to Obama meetings?
[03:37:59.197 --> 03:38:03.618]  I mean, we have usaservice.org with a map of every meeting in every town and city.
[03:38:03.618 --> 03:38:07.259]  Shouldn't we go there and lovingly explain to them, you think you're repudiating Bush?
[03:38:07.259 --> 03:38:09.639]  This is Bush on steroids?
[03:38:09.639 --> 03:38:10.599]  I suppose you can.
[03:38:10.599 --> 03:38:13.920]  I also, I would urge people to look at the big picture, right?
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:19.561]  You can always call into these big sort of Wall Street controlled talk radios.
[03:38:20.574 --> 03:38:22.396]  Uh, you can have a tremendous impact.
[03:38:22.396 --> 03:38:24.358]  Again, I recommend political organizing.
[03:38:24.358 --> 03:38:27.761]  A lot of people are looking at apocalyptic scenarios, right?
[03:38:27.761 --> 03:38:30.244]  That it's going to come to some kind of civil strife.
[03:38:30.244 --> 03:38:31.245]  I don't think we're there yet.
[03:38:31.245 --> 03:38:33.447]  I think it's time to try politics.
[03:38:33.447 --> 03:38:36.870]  Well, I see the globalists are hyping that.
[03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:39.873]  Well, you've got to have your own program to get out of the depression.
[03:38:39.873 --> 03:38:40.874]  I have one, right?
[03:38:40.874 --> 03:38:42.296]  Wipe out derivatives.
[03:38:42.296 --> 03:38:43.116]  Seize the Fed.
[03:38:43.116 --> 03:38:44.578]  Issue zero credit production.
[03:38:45.188 --> 03:38:45.908]  We're good to go.
[03:39:08.737 --> 03:39:11.699]  Seize the central bank, start making that a national bank.
[03:39:11.699 --> 03:39:14.321]  Okay, let's stop there, let's stop there, let's stop there.
[03:39:14.321 --> 03:39:17.142]  They're already doing a counterfeit of what you just said.
[03:39:17.142 --> 03:39:27.489]  They're claiming the Federal Reserve is federal, not private, and saying they are going to nationalize the banks, when in truth it is the private bankrupt banks coming in to take over with government power.
[03:39:27.489 --> 03:39:33.753]  So how do you educate folks that we're not seeing a nationalization right now, we're seeing a privatized looting taking place?
[03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:35.930]  Around this issue of derivatives.
[03:39:35.930 --> 03:39:41.912]  In other words, the derivatives are the heart of the five big money center banks that we mentioned before.
[03:39:41.912 --> 03:39:47.794]  If you wipe out derivatives, you've essentially wiped out those five banks, because they are really zombie banks, right?
[03:39:47.794 --> 03:39:49.675]  They've always been zombie banks.
[03:39:49.675 --> 03:39:51.696]  They don't lend for plant and equipment.
[03:39:51.696 --> 03:39:58.179]  When GM, Ford, and Chrysler were about to go bankrupt last December, the zombie banks did not come forward.
[03:39:58.179 --> 03:40:01.220]  We just had Circuit City collapse.
[03:40:01.220 --> 03:40:02.260]  35,000 jobs.
[03:40:02.260 --> 03:40:02.981]  600 stores.
[03:40:02.981 --> 03:40:04.081]  Where were the zombie banks?
[03:40:04.468 --> 03:40:06.531]  The zombie banks don't lend.
[03:40:06.531 --> 03:40:13.899]  They're getting money from the TARP, they're getting money on the Federal Reserve bailout, which is ten times bigger, and they're not lending.
[03:40:13.899 --> 03:40:16.262]  So these banks have got to be wiped out.
[03:40:16.262 --> 03:40:22.710]  The Federal Reserve has got to be seized, nationalized, and then you begin issuing your zero percent credit
[03:40:23.208 --> 03:40:24.669]  For production only.
[03:40:24.669 --> 03:40:26.551]  Not for financial services.
[03:40:26.551 --> 03:40:27.752]  Not for speculation.
[03:40:27.752 --> 03:40:31.015]  A lot of economists say that it shouldn't be a classical tariff either.
[03:40:31.015 --> 03:40:35.498]  It should just be a tax incentive when industry moves to the United States.
[03:40:35.498 --> 03:40:38.301]  Well, I've talked about this in the following terms.
[03:40:38.301 --> 03:40:43.105]  If you've got Count Dracula on the victim, you've got to rip Count Dracula off the victim.
[03:40:43.105 --> 03:40:44.586]  Put a stake through his heart.
[03:40:44.586 --> 03:40:47.008]  But now you've got a victim who's basically about dead.
[03:40:47.008 --> 03:40:49.690]  You've got to administer a transfusion.
[03:40:49.690 --> 03:40:50.831]  That's your federal 0% credit.
[03:40:52.176 --> 03:40:54.438]  Plus oxygen and a defibrillator.
[03:40:54.438 --> 03:40:58.522]  And that's your program of large-scale infrastructure.
[03:40:58.522 --> 03:41:04.006]  100 nuclear reactors, coast-to-coast maglev railways, commuter rail, all this.
[03:41:04.006 --> 03:41:05.588]  And your three science drivers.
[03:41:05.588 --> 03:41:09.631]  Your space program, your biomedical, and your high-energy physics.
[03:41:09.631 --> 03:41:10.892]  And that starts both sides.
[03:41:10.892 --> 03:41:11.513]  It's true.
[03:41:11.513 --> 03:41:13.495]  It's not enough just to offer lending.
[03:41:13.495 --> 03:41:17.338]  You've got to generate demand for borrowing, because you're in a panic.
[03:41:17.796 --> 03:41:25.888]  You're inhabiting the negative curvature of the inside of a collapsing... But, Webster, they've already brought us... I'm going to get our next guest briefly here.
[03:41:25.888 --> 03:41:27.751]  Have him back on in the next few days for a more detailed report.
[03:41:27.751 --> 03:41:28.512]  This is very important.
[03:41:30.034 --> 03:41:42.204]  That we're already so deep into it, some are saying it could be irrevocable, and so after our next guest leaves us, I want to briefly talk about if they allow total implosion, how would you change your plan after that point with your perspective?
[03:41:42.204 --> 03:41:52.513]  But Webster, we know the British have been caught over and over again, more than 75% of the terror attacks in Northern Ireland, Ireland and England, being staged by British Special Air Services, MI5 and MI6.
[03:41:52.513 --> 03:41:55.456]  They're now kicking this off again, and I said yesterday, I said,
[03:41:57.130 --> 03:42:04.496]  In fact, at the start of the show, before I'd seen the latest article, I said, will there be a drill around these two British soldiers being killed?
[03:42:04.496 --> 03:42:06.318]  A drill of the exact same thing happening.
[03:42:06.318 --> 03:42:12.343]  We already know that the security services military stood down even as they saw them shooting and didn't fire back.
[03:42:12.343 --> 03:42:14.044]  That is now mainstream news.
[03:42:14.044 --> 03:42:15.466]  This is the Belfast Telegraph.
[03:42:15.466 --> 03:42:17.527]  Soldiers shot dead in Northern Ireland terror attack.
[03:42:18.228 --> 03:42:20.510]  The attack happened just 36 hours from Northern Ireland.
[03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:35.023]  Chief Constable Sir Hugh Ord confirmed that undercover soldiers had been called in to carry out surveillance operations on dissidents and amid warnings that the threat against his officers and military personnel was at its highest for almost a decade that they were doing drills.
[03:42:35.723 --> 03:42:36.864]  Here's another one.
[03:42:36.864 --> 03:42:39.185]  This is out of the Metro.co.uk.
[03:42:39.185 --> 03:42:40.867]  I guess this is the one in the Metro.
[03:43:05.743 --> 03:43:07.444]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be back on.
[03:43:07.444 --> 03:43:08.425]  I think last time around,
[03:43:30.242 --> 03:43:37.647]  We were all upbeat about our victory against the European Constitution, known as the Lisbon Treaty, but this time around, it seems like things are a little different.
[03:43:37.647 --> 03:43:40.809]  So, it's great to be on, and hello to Webster Tarpley, too.
[03:43:40.809 --> 03:43:42.350]  Hi there!
[03:43:42.350 --> 03:43:45.272]  Okay, you're there in Ireland.
[03:43:45.272 --> 03:43:48.094]  Give us the breakdown of what's happening.
[03:43:48.094 --> 03:43:51.276]  Well, Alex, I think there's a lot of ambiguity going on.
[03:43:51.276 --> 03:43:55.499]  People aren't quite sure what happened or what is meant to happen out of this.
[03:43:56.398 --> 03:44:00.441]  Um, as we know that there were six people shot there on Saturday night.
[03:44:00.441 --> 03:44:05.025]  Two of them are pronounced dead, and they were two soldiers of, uh, British Army.
[03:44:05.025 --> 03:44:12.391]  There was two other soldiers hit with bullets, and there was two other civilians, which were just delivering pizzas to, uh, the barracks.
[03:44:12.391 --> 03:44:20.477]  Um, I actually did some investigation earlier, the way, uh, you were saying, when I was speaking to Rob, and I came across some interesting things.
[03:44:21.044 --> 03:44:28.906]  The actual people who provide security on these bases is called NISGS, which is the Northern Ireland Security Guard Services.
[03:44:28.906 --> 03:44:35.288]  And they are normally armed with weapons, and they also patrol their bases.
[03:44:35.288 --> 03:44:46.712]  It was confirmed from an army source in the actual Australian news that it is regular procedure to fire back upon an enemy who is attacking.
[03:44:47.441 --> 03:44:47.701]  That is a
[03:45:08.695 --> 03:45:10.316]  Fans, tens of millions worldwide.
[03:45:10.316 --> 03:45:12.498]  It's almost as big as soccer in many areas.
[03:45:12.498 --> 03:45:14.479]  Don't know in the US.
[03:45:14.479 --> 03:45:15.620]  And the same thing there.
[03:45:15.620 --> 03:45:19.183]  Mainstream news is saying, was it an inside job?
[03:45:19.183 --> 03:45:20.464]  Because the government
[03:45:21.683 --> 03:45:24.626]  There's police right there, and the shooters shoot.
[03:45:24.626 --> 03:45:27.189]  Calmly take your time, walk right by the police.
[03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.870]  Nothing's done.
[03:45:27.870 --> 03:45:29.251]  This stinks to high heaven.
[03:45:29.251 --> 03:45:31.233]  Webster, I mean, it's the same M.O.
[03:45:31.233 --> 03:45:32.154]  every time.
[03:45:32.154 --> 03:45:38.841]  Why does the establishment, we're not sure with these new cases, others have been confirmed, but why do they like to stage these shootings?
[03:45:38.841 --> 03:45:40.203]  As a pretext to bring in more troops?
[03:45:41.700 --> 03:45:51.948]  Well, Britain, under the Labour governments of Tony Blair and now Gordon Brown, Britain has gone much further down the road to a police state than the U.S.
[03:45:51.948 --> 03:45:53.209]  even.
[03:45:53.209 --> 03:45:59.394]  Part of it is that the parties are controlled top-down by the parliamentary whip system.
[03:45:59.394 --> 03:46:08.901]  The other thing is that you haven't had mass movements, you haven't had the kind of thing that you've seen in the U.S., and you don't have independent communications by and large, right?
[03:46:08.901 --> 03:46:10.642]  There's a large amount of television.
[03:46:11.152 --> 03:46:14.594]  And radio broadcasting is controlled by the BBC.
[03:46:14.594 --> 03:46:19.178]  There is some commercial opposition, you know, competition to that.
[03:46:19.178 --> 03:46:22.740]  But it doesn't amount to the kind of thing that you have in the U.S.
[03:46:22.740 --> 03:46:24.241]  of all ideological types.
[03:46:24.241 --> 03:46:37.930]  So I would say Gordon Brown, you know, having started with this thing about bank bailouts, bank nationalizations, hundreds of billions and trillions of pounds now committed to the derivatives bailout and wanting to be the leader of this, right?
[03:46:37.930 --> 03:46:39.151]  Because that's what he is right now.
[03:46:39.151 --> 03:46:40.432]  Gordon Brown is the world leader
[03:46:40.860 --> 03:46:43.354]  In the bailout brigade, I think they're
[03:46:43.789 --> 03:46:49.232]  They're tightening the screws, and they're looking for pretexts for more and more police state controls inside the country.
[03:46:49.232 --> 03:46:49.813]  That's right.
[03:46:49.813 --> 03:46:57.837]  Peaceably, the people of Ireland are moving to kick British forces out and get true sovereignty, and this violence is the best friend of the establishment.
[03:46:57.837 --> 03:47:06.502]  It's turned out most IRA was commanded by British intelligence, and they would threaten their underlings with death if they wouldn't go out and commit shootings and bombings.
[03:47:06.502 --> 03:47:09.945]  Going back to We Are Change Ireland, Keith Bryan.
[03:47:09.945 --> 03:47:12.206]  Keith, continue with other intel you've got from Ireland.
[03:47:13.390 --> 03:47:15.856]  Well, basically, I was just scouring the newspapers.
[03:47:15.856 --> 03:47:21.410]  I was just, you know, randomly Googling what the M.O.s would be, and that's how I came across this stand-down, or these...
[03:47:22.100 --> 03:47:22.880]  I don't think so.
[03:47:49.202 --> 03:47:59.246]  One gentleman called Patrick Mercer, he's a former Infantry Regiment Commanding Officer, and he is now Chairman of the Commons Counterterrorism Subcommittee.
[03:47:59.246 --> 03:48:11.212]  And he went on to say, we have to question the efficacy of the Guard Force if it is not armed guards stood by as British soldiers are shot at Northern Ireland Base, prepared to fire back on the enemy.
[03:48:11.212 --> 03:48:16.394]  And let's expand on that, they then came over and stood over them and raked them with fire again.
[03:48:17.819 --> 03:48:25.143]  Yeah, well, and this guy goes on to say, well, how are we meant to be a deterrent in the future if the terrorists know that we are not going to be shot at?
[03:48:25.143 --> 03:48:34.549]  And when you look at it, I mean, I'm sure that the people who were attacking the base knew that they were going to receive some sort of fireback or some sort of retaliation, but there was none.
[03:48:34.549 --> 03:48:46.176]  Now, why would, that's a key point, why would they waddle up after shooting them in the distance and then stand over them and shoot them again, right up at the gate of the base, not thinking they'd be fired upon, knowing there was armed forces in there?
[03:48:47.386 --> 03:48:51.810]  Yeah, not just that, they also were waiting there, Alex.
[03:48:51.810 --> 03:49:03.079]  So that, I mean, I'm actually reading army reports here, and I don't know who the person is, it's coming from the Australian and various other news sources, but they're scrutinizing the situation.
[03:49:03.079 --> 03:49:06.943]  They're saying, well, why was there no armed guards coming outside the base to collect the pieces?
[03:49:06.943 --> 03:49:12.027]  That's normal protocol for people with weapons to come outside in case there was an actual attack.
[03:49:12.708 --> 03:49:13.008]  I think so.
[03:49:25.912 --> 03:49:39.219]  One article goes on to say around 60 to 70 rounds were fired, so that's a substantial amount of ammunition being used against these six individuals, which, thank God, no more than two are killed.
[03:49:39.219 --> 03:49:44.161]  Yeah, that's two and a third banana clips sprayed into them.
[03:49:44.161 --> 03:49:45.082]  Just amazing.
[03:49:45.082 --> 03:49:48.804]  Well, is there a We Are Change website you want to plug?
[03:49:48.804 --> 03:49:53.146]  I know you guys put out a film as well and have really been making the news over there confronting politicians.
[03:49:53.146 --> 03:49:54.907]  Any sites that you want to plug?
[03:49:55.802 --> 03:49:57.784]  Yeah, there's several sites now, Alex.
[03:49:57.784 --> 03:50:00.788]  There's WiseUpJournal.com.
[03:50:00.788 --> 03:50:02.670]  Anthony runs that one.
[03:50:02.670 --> 03:50:04.071]  WiseUpJournal?
[03:50:04.071 --> 03:50:06.194]  WiseUpJournal.com?
[03:50:06.194 --> 03:50:06.934]  Yeah.
[03:50:06.934 --> 03:50:09.858]  There's WeAreChangeIreland.org.
[03:50:09.858 --> 03:50:13.502]  There's also another website called WeThePeople.ie.
[03:50:13.502 --> 03:50:16.145]  So there's a few other websites there, and there's links to others.
[03:50:17.414 --> 03:50:26.763]  It's quite interesting what's going on recently and it's reminiscent to what we once knew in the past and it's kind of being brought into the present now.
[03:50:26.763 --> 03:50:36.071]  I feel, Alex, if this goes on, basically there will be British troops back on the streets up there because they're not going to stand by while British soldiers are being fired upon.
[03:50:36.071 --> 03:50:39.554]  And now they've killed a police officer last night too.
[03:50:40.825 --> 03:50:48.249]  Yeah, basically what happened there was somebody threw a stone or a brick through some person's window.
[03:50:48.249 --> 03:51:00.616]  Maybe that was a tactic to draw the police in, but one police officer who has 22 years of experience in the police force up there, who must have seen quite a lot, he arrived up on the scene and
[03:51:01.555 --> 03:51:11.606]  Basically, when the car came to a standstill, somebody come up from the rear window and just unloaded into the car and I think he was shot in the head and he died instantly.
[03:51:11.606 --> 03:51:14.830]  Well, let's hold record, the British do most of this, they've been caught red-handed.
[03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:16.952]  We'll talk to you in the next few days as this develops.
[03:51:16.952 --> 03:51:18.454]  Thanks for your great information.
[03:51:18.454 --> 03:51:19.435]  And we are Change Ireland.
[03:51:20.359 --> 03:51:22.620]  Alex, take care of yourself, and bye to Webster.
[03:51:22.620 --> 03:51:23.280]  Bye-bye.
[03:51:23.280 --> 03:51:23.721]  Take care.
[03:51:23.721 --> 03:51:31.524]  Webster, we're going to come back in a final five-minute segment and talk about if the depression continues to unfold, if we're not able to turn them around, what do we do then?
[03:51:31.524 --> 03:51:42.989]  I know you're saying work to change it now, but how would we extricate ourselves from the crisis if it's allowed to continue to deteriorate over the next six months to a year, which is clear they're not going to change course.
[03:51:42.989 --> 03:51:48.152]  We're going to force them later, too, but you can see the energy of the people versus the establishment, and you can see the trajectory.
[03:51:48.812 --> 03:51:54.433]  And it's clear it's gonna stop, it's gonna take more time to stop this juggernaut of destruction, financial destruction, from rolling forward.
[03:51:54.433 --> 03:51:55.613]  Also, will they hit Iran?
[03:51:55.613 --> 03:51:56.754]  They're beating the war drums.
[03:51:56.754 --> 03:51:58.834]  For that, yet again, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:51:58.834 --> 03:52:01.695]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:52:01.695 --> 03:52:03.375]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:52:03.375 --> 03:52:05.135]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:52:05.135 --> 03:52:07.816]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:52:07.816 --> 03:52:12.517]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:52:12.944 --> 03:52:16.127]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:52:16.127 --> 03:52:32.602]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:52:32.602 --> 03:52:34.604]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:52:34.604 --> 03:52:36.326]  I use one every day.
[03:52:36.326 --> 03:52:38.788]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:52:39.148 --> 03:52:42.169]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:53:08.468 --> 03:53:14.329]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:53:14.329 --> 03:53:20.831]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:53:20.831 --> 03:53:22.811]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:53:22.811 --> 03:53:25.272]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:53:25.272 --> 03:53:36.114]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:53:38.453 --> 03:53:40.115]  It's not about left or right.
[03:53:40.115 --> 03:53:41.976]  It's about a one world government.
[03:53:41.976 --> 03:53:48.903]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:53:58.732 --> 03:53:59.913]  The people strike back.
[03:54:01.650 --> 03:54:12.218]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:54:12.218 --> 03:54:13.639]  Garden in a Can!

[03:55:27.115 --> 03:55:29.356]  Those are also available at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:30.436 --> 03:55:37.200]  Webster, as we launch the film coming up in the next few days, I want to have you back on next week to break it all down after you've had a chance to see it.
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:41.422]  We'll give you a prisonplanet.tv membership so you don't have to wait to have the DVD shipped to you.
[03:55:41.422 --> 03:55:44.724]  And you can go up there and watch it in super high quality and give me your review of it.
[03:55:44.724 --> 03:55:46.565]  I think you're going to be extremely pleased with it.
[03:55:46.565 --> 03:55:51.467]  We just get better and better at making these films and Obama's given us plenty of material to make it.
[03:55:51.467 --> 03:55:51.828]  We've got a
[03:55:52.688 --> 03:55:55.309]  Well, you don't get out of the depression unless you make these changes.
[03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:57.370]  There is no automatic exit from the depression.
[03:55:57.370 --> 03:55:58.811]  There is no business cycle.
[03:56:21.593 --> 03:56:27.115]  It's going to lift you out of the depression, and I'm also afraid there is no free market solution to the depression.
[03:56:27.115 --> 03:56:34.038]  If you call for the free market under these circumstances, basically making everything much worse.
[03:56:34.038 --> 03:56:35.658]  You know, think of food stamps, right?
[03:56:35.658 --> 03:56:43.561]  There are three million people in Texas who are living thanks to food stamps, and if you say free market, take that away, well, that's going to be the end of a lot of them.
[03:56:43.561 --> 03:56:47.303]  So I think that the question is, how long will it take for people
[03:56:47.867 --> 03:56:54.789]  To throw off the chains of ideology and all the illusions and all the clap-clap of the past 40 years.
[03:56:54.789 --> 03:57:00.691]  One thing is, there's a sign of a mass movement against derivatives, and that is the produce the note.
[03:57:00.691 --> 03:57:04.211]  It's a mass movement against derivatives and against foreclosures.
[03:57:04.211 --> 03:57:06.532]  It's people who are facing foreclosure.
[03:57:06.532 --> 03:57:09.673]  They're going to be thrown out on the street, and they say, wait a minute.
[03:57:10.140 --> 03:57:13.462]  You've got to produce the piece of paper that I signed.
[03:57:13.462 --> 03:57:15.623]  Produce the note.
[03:57:15.623 --> 03:57:16.924]  Show me the piece of paper.
[03:57:16.924 --> 03:57:22.146]  And they'll say, oh no, that's been securitized and sent to London, or Zurich, or Tokyo.
[03:57:22.146 --> 03:57:23.827]  We don't have that piece of paper anymore.
[03:57:23.827 --> 03:57:27.629]  Well, then you can't foreclose.
[03:57:27.629 --> 03:57:29.490]  And any kind of an honest local judge
[03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:41.698]  Uh, who's got to get re-elected will say, alright, if you don't produce the notes, then the person cannot... People have already been using that for five years to get out of many of these phony mortgages because it all is fraud.
[03:57:41.698 --> 03:57:45.080]  It was sold and turned in to derivatives.
[03:57:45.080 --> 03:57:46.821]  And I, um, I agree with you, Webster.
[03:57:46.821 --> 03:57:48.382]  We're between a rock and a hard place here.
[03:57:48.382 --> 03:57:51.945]  And I don't think all the... We're in the school of the depression, right?
[03:57:51.945 --> 03:57:54.327]  The depression is a very cruel kind of, uh,
[03:57:55.043 --> 03:58:00.785]  Educational process, but it is a school of life, and it teaches, I think, fundamentally class consciousness.
[03:58:00.785 --> 03:58:04.547]  That bankers are one thing, and you are something else.
[03:58:04.547 --> 03:58:22.494]  And any approach to the Depression that doesn't say, there are, you know, 500,000 bankers and financier oligarchs in this country who have been the beneficiaries of the system, and their interests have got to be sacrificed, because they're antithetical to the survival of humanity as a whole.
[03:58:23.635 --> 03:58:35.145]  We can't have foreclosures, we can't have derivatives, there are all kinds of things to do to stop speculation, but then you've got to get the thing going in terms of federal lending, 0% federal lending for production.
[03:58:35.658 --> 03:58:39.379]  And you've got to have your infrastructure programs and your science drivers.
[03:58:39.379 --> 03:58:45.421]  The problem is, in closing, the Feds are owned by offshore banks, so any money would always be gobbled by them.
[03:58:45.421 --> 03:58:47.261]  Webster, we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[03:58:47.261 --> 03:58:50.462]  Capital controls, capital controls and exchange controls.
[03:58:50.462 --> 03:58:51.262]  We're out of time.
[03:58:51.262 --> 03:58:53.123]  Webster, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:58:53.123 --> 03:58:55.843]  Congratulations on the new film, Alex.
[03:58:55.843 --> 03:58:56.644]  Thank you, sir.
[03:58:56.644 --> 03:58:57.444]  You'll see it soon.
[03:58:57.444 --> 03:59:00.885]  Alright, Webster Tarpley's leaving us.
[03:59:00.885 --> 03:59:01.645]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:59:03.075 --> 03:59:06.138]  If I'm able to in the future, I'll tell you the type of dirty tricks that are going on.
[03:59:06.138 --> 03:59:11.443]  I can't get into that right now on air, but know this, the Obama deception will go out.
[03:59:11.443 --> 03:59:14.566]  God's will come hell or high water, as they say.
[03:59:14.566 --> 03:59:21.833]  And it could be out today, it could be out tomorrow, or if I'm able, I may wait until Sunday, because I really want to put out some more of the trailers and build the excitement, because that's what will have a bigger effect.
[03:59:22.788 --> 03:59:28.750]  Just know this, we are fighting, and we need your prayers here, ladies and gentlemen, because we are going toe-to-toe up against the New World Order.
[03:59:28.750 --> 03:59:41.274]  I had Ron Paul on, a bunch of other powerful guests today, the rebroadcast on the audio stream starts in 70 seconds, one place, InfoWars.com, and on the MNFM dial.
[03:59:41.274 --> 03:59:43.455]  God bless you all.
[03:59:43.455 --> 03:59:46.056]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:59:46.056 --> 03:59:48.317]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:59:51.496 --> 03:59:53.178]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:59:53.178 --> 03:59:57.924]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:59:57.924 --> 04:00:00.887]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[04:00:00.887 --> 04:00:03.931]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[04:00:03.931 --> 04:00:08.657]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[04:00:08.877 --> 04:00:09.997]  If you simply prepare.
[04:00:09.997 --> 04:00:13.239]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[04:00:13.239 --> 04:00:20.242]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[04:00:20.242 --> 04:00:23.523]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
