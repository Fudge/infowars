[00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:17.235]  South Austin Lubies, where the ceiling collapses.
[00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:18.536]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:19.036]  LBJ, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:39.864]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Cody Jordan.
[00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:46.087]  Spring is only weeks away, but it doesn't look like it in Alabama, Georgia, and other parts of the South and East.
[00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:51.669]  The National Weather Service is predicting as much as 14 inches of snow for the Philadelphia area.
[00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:54.851]  As much as 15 inches could fall across southern New England.
[00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.212]  Brian Cordy is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
[00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:09.915]  This storm is expected to produce a wide swath of moderate to heavy snows all the way from the western portion of the Carolinas all the way up through New England.
[00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:19.277]  Bob Nations, who's the director of the Shelby County Office of Emergency Preparedness, says it's very unusual to see any accumulating snow in and around Memphis.
[00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:29.842]  We get some snow flurries usually each year, but when it gets to be, you know, three or four inches, that's not necessarily common for our area.
[00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:31.963]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:09.079]  The White House Budget Director says President Barack Obama will sign a big spending bill despite Republican calls for a veto.
[00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:28.331]  A $410 billion measure would keep the government operating through September 30th, the end of the current budget year.
[00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:35.097]  A watchdog group says the measure includes nearly $8 billion in earmarks, which Obama campaigned about.
[00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:43.065]  Israeli officials say Palestinian rocket attacks are still targeting Israel, six weeks after the end of a military offensive aimed at stopping them for good.
[00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:50.380]  Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is threatening painful retaliation against Gaza militants if the attacks continue.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:00.808]  The comments come as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in the region to discuss a two-state solution that aims to establish a Palestinian state at peace with Israel.
[00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:08.054]  And about 2,000 Shiites in Iraq have been protesting the results of provincial elections in Tentz, Delilah Province.

[00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:17.987]  Did you know the average household owes over $25,000 in credit card debt?
[00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:21.229]  And 65% of those households can only afford the minimum monthly payment.
[00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.050]  Are you in a debt trap you can't get out of?
[00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.131]  I can't keep this up.
[00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.011]  I need relief.
[00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:26.252]  Now you can rest easy.

[00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:50.539]  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he's confident about Iraq's future and the future of the U.S.
[00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.380]  withdrawal from the country.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:01.384]  Admiral Mike Mullen says he's reluctant to talk about winning and losing in Iraq, but he tells Fox that Baghdad will be able to successfully take control of the country.
[00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:04.805]  The President listened to General Odierno, General Petraeus, all the chiefs.
[00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:10.591]  Uh, throughout this process, which was, uh, which was very thorough and very deliberate.
[00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:13.574]  Uh, and I have a great deal of confidence in that process.
[00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:33.672]  Our sources are telling us that Taliban militants immediately surrounded the compound and we're still trying to get more details.
[00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:36.314]  It's unclear exactly who was among the dead.
[00:04:36.314 --> 00:04:41.777]  A broadcast pioneer with one of the nation's most familiar radio voices has died.
[00:04:41.777 --> 00:04:44.999]  Paul Harvey was 90 and died yesterday in Arizona.
[00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:53.660]  ABC Radio Network's President Jim Robinson says Paul Harvey lost his wife of almost 70 years, Angel, less than a year ago.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.544]  She was magnificent and they were quite in love every day and it was a pleasure to be around them as a couple.
[00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:02.085]  I will miss them both dearly.
[00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:08.889]  Former President George W. Bush says Harvey entertained, enlightened, and informed.
[00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.651]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:20.340]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.140]  and the world.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.003]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:05:25.003 --> 00:05:31.487]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:05:31.487 --> 00:05:33.528]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:41.473]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:46.439]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:52.265]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:54.448]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:56.691]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you

[00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:31.783]  He stands for what's right.
[00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:35.063]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:55.871]  We are live.
[00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:59.492]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday edition.
[00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:04.553]  Abbreviated transmission I do every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:04.553 --> 00:07:08.034]  Abbreviated from the weekday 4-hour broadcast.
[00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:08.354]  All right.
[00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:10.314]  Very important radio show today.
[00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:10.975]  Very informative.
[00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:13.995]  A lot of key information for everybody out there.
[00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:17.756]  We'll also have open phones on the subject we're bringing up at 877-590-5525.
[00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:17.776]  877-590.
[00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:25.385]  5525, and that will get you up and on the air.
[00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:30.087]  There's a lot of issues I want to cover today.
[00:07:30.087 --> 00:07:40.811]  Obama is just adding new lies every week, going 180 degrees away from everything he claimed and said that he would do.
[00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:46.273]  And I want to go back over some of the old lies, but first get to the new lies.
[00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:49.935]  One of them is that he promised to immediately bring home U.S.
[00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:51.015]  troops within six months.
[00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:53.939]  Then he said he'd look at it in 16 months.
[00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:59.105]  Now they're saying 23 months, they'll look at it and that 50,000 troops will stay there permanently.
[00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:01.107]  Well, that was always the Pentagon plan.
[00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:02.929]  Doesn't matter what president's in.
[00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:09.617]  The big foreign banks that have hijacked this nation control the military, control the Pentagon, control the whole military-industrial complex.
[00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:20.058]  But the issue here is, the headline across the nation this weekend is, Obama to end occupation of Iraq within 20 months, 23 months.
[00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:32.183]  But then you read the subparagraphs, it says, oh, he's going to bring back all the combat troops and combat operations will be over.
[00:08:32.183 --> 00:08:32.983]  Will be over.
[00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:35.765]  Within the twenty-plus months.
[00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:41.829]  Well, that's what George Bush said six months after the invasion of Iraq back in 2003.
[00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:49.613]  Remember on the aircraft carrier in the commando, you know, fighter pilot outfit with the giant codpiece?
[00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:53.195]  He's up there saying that major combat operations are over.
[00:08:53.195 --> 00:09:00.239]  This is all the same lies and the presidents are puppets that just read off of a teleprompter.
[00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:17.000]  Also, Obama said that he was only going to raise taxes back to the old 1990s tax rate of 40% against couples making more than $250,000 a year, or individuals making $125,000 a year.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:29.124]  But now it's coming out, scores of new taxes on Medicare and Medicaid and capital gains tax, and they're getting rid of many of the tax exemptions for legitimate things.
[00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:34.053]  Just a complete and total lie there.
[00:09:34.053 --> 00:09:39.557]  He's also stated that they're going to continue the violation of the Geneva Convention and the Constitution.
[00:09:39.557 --> 00:09:45.581]  Even the Supreme Court said they couldn't do it last year at Bagram Air Base and other camps around the world.
[00:09:45.581 --> 00:09:55.146]  They may shut Guantanamo, but they're going to open more camps and even camps in the United States, according to ABC News, and violate the Bill of Rights Constitution and Geneva Convention.
[00:09:55.146 --> 00:09:59.109]  Of course, he's basically hired nothing but top lobbyists and special interests.
[00:10:00.268 --> 00:10:02.750]  Into the new White House swearing he wouldn't do that.
[00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.171]  He swore he'd end the Patriot Act.
[00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.832]  He says he's going to expand that.
[00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:09.454]  He swore that they were going to go after telecoms, then he voted for it.
[00:10:09.454 --> 00:10:12.155]  And the warrantless wiretapping, now they're going to expand that.
[00:10:12.155 --> 00:10:14.857]  That's in the news.
[00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:16.698]  What has he told the truth about, though?
[00:10:16.698 --> 00:10:24.782]  Saying he would set up a million-person domestic security force under the Pentagon's control and turn mercenaries loose on the American people.
[00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:26.603]  They are doing that.
[00:10:26.603 --> 00:10:29.305]  But now he has the nerve
[00:10:30.322 --> 00:10:50.169]  To come out on his weekly radio address, Saturday, and say that he is fighting special interest in pork barrel, and that he knows special interest is going to come after him, and that they want to fight, and that he's ready to fight them, similar to Bush saying, bring it on.
[00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:52.790]  As if this guy isn't Mr. Special Interest.
[00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.771]  Worse than even Bush.
[00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:55.011]  I mean, it's hard to believe.
[00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:55.991]  Worse than even Clinton.
[00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:56.672]  Hard to top that.
[00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:02.339]  But he has the nerve to sit there and say, I'm going to help the American people.
[00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:04.260]  I'm going to cut the budget.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.621]  I'm going to go after special interest.
[00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:15.629]  When he just passed a $787 billion stimulus package that major analysts have looked at, 90% of it goes to special interest.
[00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:18.111]  And yes, there is, every two weeks, a $15.35.
[00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:20.974]  You can buy a pizza with that.
[00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:24.537]  You might be able to get a combo and get two medium pizzas for that.
[00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:25.958]  Now, you might get one pizza and maybe a
[00:11:26.607 --> 00:11:27.748]  Leader of Koch, I'm not sure.
[00:11:27.748 --> 00:11:33.413]  The point is that, yes, that's your tax cut, while he raises all these other taxes.
[00:11:33.413 --> 00:11:42.300]  And then he's announced, and it's not State of the Union, they billed it as that addressed to Congress last week, for the carbon taxes on everything.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:49.686]  Toilet paper, light bulbs, all fuels, heating oil, natural gas, your homes.
[00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:51.487]  That will be a tax also on U.S.
[00:11:51.487 --> 00:11:53.649]  factories and businesses that will be passed on to you.
[00:11:54.949 --> 00:12:04.094]  So just unbelievable tax increases on every front, but here he is shaking his finger at the teleprompter, reading a speech written by somebody else.
[00:12:04.094 --> 00:12:12.518]  He's ready for a fight for the people, and he's going to fight special interest, just like he was going to not hire any lobbyists, and just like on and on and on.
[00:12:12.518 --> 00:12:17.101]  I mean, this is going to be a three and a half trillion dollar budget.
[00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:33.941]  And on top of that, on top of the record one plus trillion dollar defense budget he's supporting, he wants $800 billion for combat operations on top of that, and is going to increase the total number of US troops in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:41.907]  Just... I mean, even if you support Barack Obama and like him and like his tie and his suit or whatever, I mean, do you like the fact that he lied about everything?
[00:12:41.907 --> 00:12:45.190]  Here he is, arrogantly, putting out more propaganda.
[00:12:46.286 --> 00:12:49.267]  I realize that passing this budget won't be easy.
[00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:55.309]  Because it represents real and dramatic change, it also represents a threat to the status quo in Washington.
[00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:59.611]  I know that the insurance industry won't like the idea... Hit pause, back it up.
[00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.912]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:13:01.912 --> 00:13:05.233]  Real change, and it's a five-minute address, we're gonna just play like a minute of it.
[00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:08.294]  You can go watch it at whitehouse.gov, it's on the front page if you want.
[00:13:08.294 --> 00:13:10.855]  I mean, he says this is change from business as usual.
[00:13:12.194 --> 00:13:13.535]  Well, I guess in a way it's true.
[00:13:13.535 --> 00:13:15.035]  I mean, Bush tripled the size of government.
[00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:19.436]  I guess Obama's going to double it in one year, and Bush tripled it in eight.
[00:13:19.436 --> 00:13:36.322]  So if he doubles it every year, or triples it every year, this is a little more than a doubling, about two and a half times, then I guess he will make it seven times bigger, eight times bigger, or maybe ten times bigger.
[00:13:36.322 --> 00:13:36.862]  Do the math!
[00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:50.059]  So I guess in a way, business as usual is growing the government, the bureaucracy, the corruption, the looting, the pork barrel, and so he's radically expanding that, dwarfing what Bush did, and I guess it is change.
[00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:52.701]  But it is business as usual, though, folks, to grow government.
[00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:53.782]  Here it is.
[00:13:53.782 --> 00:13:56.764]  I realize that passing this budget won't be easy.
[00:13:56.764 --> 00:14:01.909]  Because it represents real and dramatic change, it also represents a threat to the status quo in Washington.
[00:14:02.777 --> 00:14:16.887]  I know that the insurance industry won't like the idea that they'll have to bid competitively to continue offering Medicare coverage, but that's how we'll help preserve and protect Medicare and lower healthcare costs for American families.
[00:14:16.887 --> 00:14:19.229]  Notice how he acts like it's some free market thing.
[00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:20.710]  That's a $45 billion deal.
[00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.792]  That'll just bring federal control over the insurance companies.
[00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:29.797]  If it was truly competitive bidding, it might be a good idea, but that's $40-something billion out of a $3.5 trillion budget.
[00:14:29.797 --> 00:14:31.658]  So he can act like he's some libertarian.
[00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.548]  Keep going.
[00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:37.730]  Lenders won't like the idea that we're ending their huge taxpayer subsidies.
[00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.893]  But that's how we'll save taxpayers nearly $50 billion and make college more affordable.
[00:14:41.893 --> 00:14:42.994]  Stop right there!
[00:14:42.994 --> 00:14:46.816]  Ending... ending special interest.
[00:14:46.816 --> 00:14:49.858]  I mean, this is just... keep going.
[00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:54.521]  I know that oil and gas companies won't like us ending nearly $30 billion in tax breaks.
[00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:59.266]  But that's how we'll help fund a renewable energy economy that will create new jobs.
[00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:00.147]  Stop right there.
[00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:01.208]  That's just a new tax.
[00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:03.069]  The oil companies will just raise prices.
[00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.630]  That'll be passed on to you.
[00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.133]  The oil companies, while they're corrupt, they bought up most of the refineries in the U.S.
[00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:10.655]  and shut them down to artificially create a bottleneck.
[00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:15.398]  They're not involved in most of the big countries in the fields and the actual profits that go to the central banks.
[00:15:15.398 --> 00:15:16.839]  So, another bait-and-switch.
[00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:18.881]  Looting one of the few industries we had left.
[00:15:18.881 --> 00:15:19.281]  Keep going.
[00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:20.042]  Industries.
[00:15:20.612 --> 00:15:27.416]  In other words, I know these steps won't sit well with the special interests and lobbyists who are invested in the old ways of doing business.
[00:15:27.416 --> 00:15:28.717]  Stop it again!
[00:15:28.717 --> 00:15:30.018]  The lobbyist!
[00:15:30.018 --> 00:15:33.660]  This is Mr. Lobbyist who promised he wouldn't hire one lobbyist or donor.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.380]  That's all he's done.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.221]  Keep going.
[00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:37.922]  ...gearing up for a fight as we speak.
[00:15:37.922 --> 00:15:39.764]  My message to them is this.
[00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:46.788]  So am I. The system we have now might work for the powerful and well-connected interests... Stop right there!
[00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:50.110]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back I'm going to finish up with comments on this.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:58.843]  Uh, he is the special interest, but instead of just the low-level corporations getting some goodies, it's all gotta go to the banks.
[00:15:58.843 --> 00:16:06.586]  Because see, once they bankrupt the nation, or a third world country, they, then all the money goes to the banks on interest and nothing else.
[00:16:06.586 --> 00:16:12.548]  So it is true that some of the pork barrel's gonna be cut, but the overall spending's gonna increase, because it all goes to the New World Order.
[00:16:12.548 --> 00:16:12.948]  Stay with us.
[00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:22.259]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:26.821]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:31.483]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:16:31.483 --> 00:16:33.783]  It's a documented fact.
[00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:40.546]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:16:40.546 --> 00:16:43.447]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals,
[00:16:43.607 --> 00:16:44.087]  I think so.
[00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:19.147]  Hello, this is Peter Cronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[00:17:19.147 --> 00:17:31.497]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[00:17:31.497 --> 00:17:37.082]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[00:17:37.082 --> 00:17:38.543]  It's the purchase of gold and silver.
[00:17:39.064 --> 00:17:45.055]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:50.055]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[00:17:50.055 --> 00:17:50.835]  Give me a call.
[00:17:50.835 --> 00:17:55.298]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:17:55.298 --> 00:17:59.600]  And allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.421]  That's Peter Kronschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:18:01.421 --> 00:18:05.624]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, while you can still purchase gold with paper.
[00:18:15.717 --> 00:18:17.539]  Life Change Tea sets the standard.
[00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:24.585]  Have you heard on radio all the new teas with funny names, movie stars, celebrities endorsing these products and so on?
[00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:26.146]  Have you checked the results?
[00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:29.629]  Not the pictures of the bikini babes and such, but the results.
[00:18:29.629 --> 00:18:34.954]  Have you checked their pricing and the funky three-month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:18:34.954 --> 00:18:36.175]  Have you checked their results?
[00:18:36.175 --> 00:18:37.136]  Oh, that's right, I said that.
[00:18:37.236 --> 00:18:39.637]  Did you check the ingredients and you checked for caffeine?
[00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:40.938]  Yeah!
[00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:42.939]  Life Change Tea is the real deal!
[00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:47.841]  Not a new yippie-yi-yay tea, but a tea if you drink it daily, it'll change your life.
[00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:49.322]  And it will clean your body.
[00:18:49.322 --> 00:18:50.643]  Our middle name is Results.
[00:18:50.643 --> 00:18:52.844]  You can pay more and you can have a celebrity smile.
[00:18:53.004 --> 00:18:54.104]  Or you can get results.
[00:18:54.104 --> 00:18:54.665]  Your call.
[00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:56.906]  Or should I say, make the call.

[00:19:13.684 --> 00:19:17.388]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:23.114]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:19:23.114 --> 00:19:27.459]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.922]  Nature's Gem Premium Omega-3.
[00:19:29.922 --> 00:19:35.708]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:36.388]  I don't know.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.361]  Nature's Gem Golden Flax is pure.
[00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:58.884]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non-GMO.

[00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:08.710]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.331]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:20:28.614 --> 00:20:38.561]  We're back live.
[00:20:38.561 --> 00:20:41.523]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:20:41.523 --> 00:20:49.589]  Yeah, if you go up to whitehouse.gov with the audio or playing from the video, the headline is, Keeping Promises.
[00:20:49.589 --> 00:20:51.410]  All he does is break them.
[00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.032]  So, he's going to fight special interests.
[00:20:54.032 --> 00:20:55.173]  9.7 trillion during Bush.
[00:20:55.734 --> 00:21:03.981]  In other words, I know these steps won't sit well with the special interests and lobbyists who are invested in the old ways of doing business.
[00:21:03.981 --> 00:21:06.123]  And I know they're gearing up for a fight as we speak.
[00:21:06.123 --> 00:21:07.084]  My message to them is this.
[00:21:07.084 --> 00:21:07.685]  So am I.
[00:21:23.188 --> 00:21:30.352]  The system we have now might work for the powerful and well-connected interests that have run Washington for far too long.
[00:21:30.352 --> 00:21:31.633]  But I don't.
[00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:32.834]  I work for the American people.
[00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:33.554]  Stop right there!
[00:21:33.554 --> 00:21:34.695]  I didn't... Oh, really?
[00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:38.577]  Is that why you brought in all the former Bush people and Clinton people?
[00:21:38.577 --> 00:21:45.161]  Like Larry Summers, who actually got rid of the different laws that allowed the banks to create all these derivatives in the 1990s?
[00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:52.530]  And Bush continued it, but to sit there and say that this is not business as usual, this is something new.
[00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.070]  It is new.
[00:21:53.070 --> 00:22:00.556]  You're just letting those that have raped us and looted this nation do it even at a bigger level, on a higher plane.
[00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:02.017]  I can't listen anymore of it.
[00:22:02.017 --> 00:22:04.419]  Let's go ahead and go to another big fat lie by this guy.
[00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:06.800]  Here's a headline out of Reuters.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.143]  Obama says combat operations in Iraq to end in August of 2010, or 18 months from now.
[00:22:13.746 --> 00:22:21.611]  Well, when you read the Pentagon, really, they say they'll start looking, then, at withdrawing some of the combat forces, but leaving 50,000 U.S.
[00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:24.192]  troops there in all these bases that they built.
[00:22:24.192 --> 00:22:26.233]  They were never going to leave.
[00:22:26.233 --> 00:22:28.955]  And leaving at least 100,000 mercenaries there.
[00:22:28.955 --> 00:22:30.416]  There's 200,000 there now.
[00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:34.138]  That's 150,000 troops in support.
[00:22:34.138 --> 00:22:37.920]  And now they want a million-person domestic military that'll be here in the U.S.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.902]  and overseas to get around Posse Comitatus.
[00:22:41.772 --> 00:22:45.855]  And what does this new million-person civilian army do?
[00:22:45.855 --> 00:22:48.557]  It occupies countries the globalists take over using U.S.
[00:22:48.557 --> 00:22:49.057]  force.
[00:22:49.057 --> 00:22:55.582]  The bankers use us as their attack dog to take countries over, and then we pay for it in tax money.
[00:22:55.582 --> 00:23:00.886]  And all these idiot good ol' boys, I hear them call talk radio, yeah, we're taking the oil, that's why we do so good.
[00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:01.806]  No, idiot.
[00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:04.548]  Because of all of that, they don't explore for oil here.
[00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:07.170]  It hurts our economy and you pay for it.
[00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:07.971]  Ugh, it makes me sick.
[00:23:08.618 --> 00:23:11.659]  Now we've heard this end of major combat operations before.
[00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:13.780]  It's the same Pentagon lies.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.501]  Remember under Bush the last six years?
[00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:16.041]  Yes.
[00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:23.284]  Coming up the 14th of this month it'll be six years since 2003 that the troops have been there when they promised they'd be home in six months.
[00:23:23.284 --> 00:23:23.664]  Remember that?
[00:23:23.664 --> 00:23:26.346]  Remember Bush on the deck of an aircraft carrier?
[00:23:26.346 --> 00:23:28.266]  Major combat operations are over?
[00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:29.427]  Well now Obama's saying,
[00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:18.080]  Well, in 16 to 23 months, major combat operations might be over.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.060]  History book says U.S.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.120]  back, but it's globalists back.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.361]  They control us.
[00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:24.781]  And then he attacked Iran with U.S.
[00:24:24.781 --> 00:24:25.421]  funding.
[00:24:25.421 --> 00:24:26.062]  Then the U.S.
[00:24:26.062 --> 00:24:29.142]  told him, go ahead and attack... ...Abraham Gillespie, U.S.
[00:24:29.142 --> 00:24:32.543]  ambassador, said, go ahead and attack... ...Khaled.
[00:24:32.543 --> 00:24:34.324]  And then they had 14 years of siege.
[00:24:34.324 --> 00:24:35.844]  A million and a half Iraqis died.
[00:24:35.844 --> 00:24:39.985]  And then a million... ...300 plus thousand have died in the last six years of occupation.
[00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:43.598]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:24:43.598 --> 00:24:44.599]  Reality doesn't matter.
[00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:52.086]  They'll just put out Three Doors Down music videos and Kid Rock music videos showing the troops playing soccer with the kids over there.
[00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:54.528]  And again, people say, oh, don't you be anti-military.
[00:24:54.528 --> 00:24:58.071]  In Germany, I would have been against the military because Hitler controlled it.
[00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:01.274]  In Russia, I wouldn't be against their military, I'm against Stalin controlling it.
[00:25:01.274 --> 00:25:03.136]  Or Mao controlling the Chinese military.
[00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.152]  In every case in history, when you have tyranny, they use the military against the people.
[00:25:09.152 --> 00:25:12.073]  They're openly announcing they're going to use the military against us here in the U.S.
[00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:17.254]  They've hired felons, aggravated felons, illegal aliens, aggravated illegal aliens.
[00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:19.715]  Not just criminals, but illegal aliens that are criminals.
[00:25:19.715 --> 00:25:21.516]  That's what's making up the military.
[00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:27.138]  That's how they're making our military a foreign force.
[00:25:27.138 --> 00:25:29.619]  The country has been captured by offshore banks.
[00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:33.020]  Now, if you love the illusion of we're the good guys and everything's fine and
[00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.234]  You're going to lose your pension fund, you're going to lose your stock market, you're going to lose your 401k.
[00:25:38.234 --> 00:25:41.997]  The IMF, the World Bank, openly say they're going to make us a third world country.
[00:25:41.997 --> 00:25:44.019]  They don't like there being middle classes.
[00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:50.284]  They're going to use the carbon taxes over every facet of your life to break you, to break me.
[00:25:50.284 --> 00:25:51.945]  This is going to happen.
[00:25:51.945 --> 00:25:55.188]  How many things do I have to be right about over the years?
[00:25:55.188 --> 00:25:56.990]  I have their own battle plans.
[00:26:00.683 --> 00:26:01.904]  By the way, I'm making a film.
[00:26:01.904 --> 00:26:06.265]  It's basically done today, and it's going out to be manufactured tomorrow.
[00:26:06.265 --> 00:26:12.688]  And I finally wrote the back cover last night for the film, The Obama Deception, and I think this sums up what's happening.
[00:26:12.688 --> 00:26:19.031]  The Obama Deception is a hard-hitting film that completely destroys the myth that Barack Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:26:19.031 --> 00:26:23.293]  The Obama phenomenon is a hoax, carefully crafted by the captains of the New World Order.
[00:26:23.293 --> 00:26:27.975]  He is being pushed as savior in an attempt to con the American people into accepting global slavery.
[00:26:29.414 --> 00:26:32.256]  We have reached a critical juncture in the New World Order's plans.
[00:26:32.256 --> 00:26:35.858]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:37.759]  Being openly announced, I would add.
[00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:43.443]  International bankers plan to loot the people of the United States and turn them into slaves on a global plantation.
[00:26:43.443 --> 00:26:49.506]  Covered in this film, who Obama works for, what lies he is told, and the real agenda.
[00:26:49.506 --> 00:26:53.089]  If you want to know the facts and cut through all the hype, then this is the film for you.
[00:26:53.089 --> 00:26:58.592]  That's right, if you don't want to be a sucker and want to know reality, not what you make up in your head or the TV tells you, this is the film.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.242]  Watch the Obama deception and learn how.
[00:27:01.242 --> 00:27:14.696]  Obama is continuing the process of transforming America into something that resembles Nazi Germany, which forces national service, domestic civilian spies, warrantless wiretaps, the destruction of the Second Amendment, FEMA camps, and martial law.
[00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:15.837]  All of that's now mainstream news.
[00:27:15.837 --> 00:27:18.660]  It's not just Alex telling you 12 years ago it was being set up.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.361]  It's now public.
[00:27:19.361 --> 00:27:20.702]  Because they're getting ready to go with it.
[00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:28.957]  Obama's handlers are openly announcing the creation of a new bank of the world that will dominate every nation on earth through carbon taxes and military force.
[00:27:28.957 --> 00:27:35.744]  International bankers are purposefully engineering the worldwide financial meltdown to bankrupt the nations of the planet and bring in world government.
[00:27:35.744 --> 00:27:42.192]  Obama plans to loot the middle class, destroy pensions, and federalize the state so the population is completely dependent on the central government.
[00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:54.516]  The elite are using Obama to pacify the public, so they can usher in the North American Union by stealth, launch a new Cold War, and continue the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:27:54.516 --> 00:27:58.819]  The information contained in this film is vital to the future of the Republic and to freedom worldwide.
[00:27:58.819 --> 00:28:02.261]  President Obama is only the tool of a larger agenda.
[00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:12.408]  Until... Until all are made aware, humanity will remain captive to the masters of the New World Order.
[00:28:13.673 --> 00:28:18.174]  And I got a calls about this Friday and I YouTubed it and did find it.
[00:28:18.174 --> 00:28:19.114]  I meant to bring it in, guys.
[00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:20.655]  We'll look for it during a break.
[00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:29.096]  Rush Limbaugh, Friday, said, yes, there's a world government, a bank of the world, a new world order is going to run America, but the liberals are behind it.
[00:28:29.096 --> 00:28:30.997]  All those years he said it didn't exist.
[00:28:30.997 --> 00:28:32.757]  All those years he said it wasn't real.
[00:28:32.757 --> 00:28:36.358]  And I was asking on the air a few weeks ago, how is Hannity and Limbaugh and all of them
[00:28:37.185 --> 00:28:54.492]  Still saying there's no plan for a world government when the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Associated Press, Reuters, the Times of London, the Financial Times of London, hundreds of... Time Magazine Newsweek announcing world government with a world bank ruling us.
[00:28:54.492 --> 00:28:56.133]  How would they deny that?
[00:28:56.133 --> 00:28:57.294]  They can't deny it.
[00:28:57.294 --> 00:28:59.555]  See, now they think it's too late for us to stop it.
[00:28:59.555 --> 00:29:00.895]  Now it's going public.
[00:29:00.895 --> 00:29:02.496]  So they're having to admit it's real.
[00:29:03.954 --> 00:29:05.995]  Ladies and gentlemen, we can still defeat this.
[00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:10.637]  If you will wake up, face the facts, get the word out.
[00:29:10.637 --> 00:29:11.618]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:11.618 --> 00:29:17.661]  Don't forget the obamadeception.net.
[00:29:17.661 --> 00:29:18.881]  Newsflash!
[00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:21.703]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[00:29:21.703 --> 00:29:25.705]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[00:29:27.137 --> 00:29:31.099]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:35.721]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:42.725]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[00:29:42.725 --> 00:29:51.049]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.

[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.704]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.

[00:31:28.598 --> 00:31:32.019]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:32.399]  I think so.

[00:33:18.206 --> 00:33:27.010]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:32.553]  Waging war on corruption, crashing for the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:32.553 --> 00:33:35.214]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:35.214 --> 00:33:36.455]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:36.455 --> 00:33:40.637]  So much news that I don't just do four hours a day, Monday through Friday.
[00:33:40.637 --> 00:33:42.078]  I come in and do the Sunday show.
[00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:47.871]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:51.573]  Loaded phones here, but you can call in after you hear a caller hang up at 877-590-5525.
[00:33:51.573 --> 00:33:59.235]  Going to go to the Mojave, Alaska, Indiana, California, Austin, Indiana, you name it.
[00:33:59.235 --> 00:34:03.756]  But before we do that, see, it's simple in psychological warfare.
[00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:15.320]  As the globalists were setting up world government, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, having Congress sign away its authority, other nations sign away their authority, having Europe sign away their authority to these unelected global bodies.
[00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.074]  They would say it doesn't exist.
[00:34:18.074 --> 00:34:18.696]  It's not happening.
[00:34:18.696 --> 00:34:20.042]  There's no plan for a new world order.
[00:34:20.042 --> 00:34:21.448]  There's no plan for a carbon tax.
[00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:29.751]  And then there's a lot of people in society that if the establishment says something isn't kosher or proper to talk about, they won't discuss it.
[00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:38.215]  Now the establishment comes out and admits they're setting up world government, but says it's the solution to the global meltdown caused by the global central banks.
[00:34:38.215 --> 00:34:44.477]  But they say the global central banks will fix it all if we just give up all of our freedoms to them, a new bank of the world.
[00:34:44.477 --> 00:34:47.078]  And they're publicizing it as a global new deal.
[00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:50.985]  A giant power grab.
[00:34:50.985 --> 00:35:06.437]  And so a lot of people, even though it's now admitted that world government's real, the New World Order's real, that it's tyrannical, I mean, the Times of London, Sunday Times, wrote a big story, and now for world government, and said, yeah, it's been secret, yeah, it's tyrannical, but it's for your own interest we kept it secret.
[00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:10.920]  And then I still have people writing news articles about me, attacking me, saying it doesn't exist.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.503]  Folks, they're treating you like children, like idiots.
[00:35:14.503 --> 00:35:16.865]  Powerful men and groups always want to dominate.
[00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.566]  The globalists are just offshore pirates,
[00:35:19.005 --> 00:35:28.832]  That are outside nations' rules, that control the nations through their bureaucracy, through their lobbyists, and who use those tools to implode those nations' wealth and transfer it offshore.
[00:35:28.832 --> 00:35:31.954]  That's what the New World Order is.
[00:35:31.954 --> 00:35:38.078]  Coming up, Democrats introduce public national service bills, forced national service bills.
[00:35:38.078 --> 00:35:39.519]  That is coming up.
[00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:44.162]  Also, BBC, more seeds for Doomsday Vault.
[00:35:44.162 --> 00:35:48.185]  They've got giant UN bases all over the world, including the Arctic.
[00:35:50.623 --> 00:35:54.405]  Filled with tens of thousands of varieties of heirloom seeds.
[00:35:54.405 --> 00:35:56.887]  They know what their genetic engineering is doing.
[00:35:56.887 --> 00:36:00.429]  And that dovetails with this story, later I'll tell you how, out of The Statesman.
[00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:03.351]  Texans unknowingly donate children's blood to research.
[00:36:03.351 --> 00:36:04.231]  Well, yeah.
[00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:12.696]  Every major industrialized nation, for 36 years, secretly takes the child's blood and puts it in an illegal DNA database.
[00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:19.160]  Australia, England, and Canada are now announcing they're going to use the illegal database to keep a DNA database on everyone for crimes.
[00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:21.470]  Just amazing.
[00:36:35.788 --> 00:36:39.349]  Volunteer National Service, his little Stasi force.
[00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:43.991]  They have all these gun buyback programs and one of them was in Dallas.
[00:36:43.991 --> 00:36:47.312]  Dallas sites turning 147 guns in exchange for grocery cards.
[00:36:47.312 --> 00:36:49.973]  That sells the image that guns are evil, guns are bad.
[00:36:49.973 --> 00:36:55.794]  They have the local newscast showing people handing their guns in, acclimating the public for national gun confiscation.
[00:36:55.794 --> 00:36:58.855]  That happened in England, Australia, and other countries that did ban guns.
[00:36:58.855 --> 00:37:00.996]  This is a shake-and-bake operation.
[00:37:00.996 --> 00:37:03.517]  This is a recipe that's being followed.
[00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:06.412]  Let's go to Barron in Mojave.
[00:37:06.412 --> 00:37:07.212]  Mojave Desert.
[00:37:07.212 --> 00:37:08.552]  Is that in Mexico or the U.S.?
[00:37:08.552 --> 00:37:09.853]  We'll find out.
[00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:11.093]  Barron, good to have you calling.
[00:37:11.093 --> 00:37:13.034]  What's on your mind?
[00:37:13.034 --> 00:37:13.614]  Not much.
[00:37:13.614 --> 00:37:15.074]  It's in the United States.
[00:37:15.074 --> 00:37:17.095]  It's the Mojave Desert.
[00:37:17.095 --> 00:37:18.495]  West Nevada.
[00:37:18.495 --> 00:37:20.036]  About 75 degrees.
[00:37:20.036 --> 00:37:23.157]  It wasn't for the chemtrails falling on me.
[00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:25.078]  There goes his call.
[00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:25.898]  Didn't let him go.
[00:37:25.898 --> 00:37:26.558]  He hung up.
[00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:27.915]  Hey Alex?
[00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:28.376]  How you doing?
[00:37:28.376 --> 00:37:29.576]  Okay, yeah, it's already too late.
[00:37:29.576 --> 00:37:30.777]  We're in such a downward spiral.
[00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:31.897]  The snowball is out of control.
[00:37:50.766 --> 00:37:57.687]  The only way that we can win this is if the federal government was closed down completely, but that's never going to happen.
[00:37:58.559 --> 00:38:03.741]  So, my question to you is, what are you personally doing for protection?
[00:38:03.741 --> 00:38:04.841]  Okay, I know you have guns.
[00:38:04.841 --> 00:38:07.202]  I'm talking about land.
[00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:09.443]  Are you planning on moving?
[00:38:09.443 --> 00:38:10.623]  When?
[00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:19.526]  Last week, when Art Bell was on his show, he mentioned something that he's taking precautions, and then the guy doesn't say what he's actually doing.
[00:38:19.526 --> 00:38:20.487]  Do you follow me?
[00:38:20.487 --> 00:38:21.907]  No, I've got the questions.
[00:38:21.907 --> 00:38:23.608]  It's two-parter.
[00:38:23.608 --> 00:38:27.029]  Number one, what did Colonel William Travis at the Alamo say?
[00:38:27.861 --> 00:38:32.642]  Just days after he dropped off his son with my family in Central Texas.
[00:38:32.642 --> 00:38:34.642]  You know, my family the heirs on my mom's side.
[00:38:34.642 --> 00:38:35.463]  Raised Colonel Travis.
[00:38:35.463 --> 00:38:36.463]  I'm proud of that fact.
[00:38:36.463 --> 00:38:41.584]  He wrote a letter out saying we've all decided to stand and fight and victory or death.
[00:38:41.584 --> 00:38:44.845]  So in the Info War, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:38:44.845 --> 00:38:46.305]  I'm staying here.
[00:38:46.305 --> 00:38:49.686]  I'm defending and I know we have a chance to defeat the New World Order.
[00:38:49.686 --> 00:38:50.926]  How am I preparing?
[00:38:50.926 --> 00:38:53.966]  I thank God from Mexican land grants in 1829.
[00:38:53.966 --> 00:38:56.367]  We still have some property in East Texas.
[00:38:57.271 --> 00:38:59.013]  And if I have to, I've got a place I can go to there.
[00:38:59.013 --> 00:39:06.620]  I also have a small piece of land out in the German Hill Country out by Fredericksburg, a very small piece, where I can go to if I have to if society totally breaks down.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:11.405]  As the Feds are hoping it will, we can stop that if we can stop them from continuing their banker takeover.
[00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:12.226]  They'll give us no quarter.
[00:39:12.226 --> 00:39:13.487]  They do this in third world countries all the time.
[00:39:13.487 --> 00:39:17.951]  Look at Argentina in 2000, folks, if you want to know what's happening.
[00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:19.613]  I do have the Second Amendment to defend myself.
[00:39:20.669 --> 00:39:25.232]  I do, of course, have storable food, things like that, but that's just my insurance policy.
[00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:32.558]  I am proactively trying to rally the people to believe that we can defeat this new world order.
[00:39:32.558 --> 00:39:37.081]  Now, here's a story that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:37.081 --> 00:39:38.062]  Majority of U.S.
[00:39:38.062 --> 00:39:39.903]  states joined sovereignty movement
[00:39:40.555 --> 00:39:56.583]  Assert 10th Amendment rights, and if you read the bill in Texas, the bills in New Hampshire, and the bills in Colorado, and the bill they just passed in Oklahoma out of the House, and other states are passing it, they say, you feds, you cannot ban any more guns, we're just nullifying your anti-gun bills.
[00:39:56.583 --> 00:39:59.585]  You can't put us in FEMA camps, and they list the FEMA camps that have been built.
[00:39:59.585 --> 00:40:01.346]  People now know this is real!
[00:40:01.346 --> 00:40:04.067]  Not just Alex crying in the wilderness here.
[00:40:04.067 --> 00:40:07.028]  They say you're not going to have forced national conscription, or service.
[00:40:07.028 --> 00:40:07.649]  The states
[00:40:09.181 --> 00:40:12.123]  Created the federal government.
[00:40:12.123 --> 00:40:14.485]  The states created it under the Constitution.
[00:40:14.485 --> 00:40:19.188]  They convened it under the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[00:40:19.188 --> 00:40:21.529]  The states created the feds.
[00:40:21.529 --> 00:40:29.335]  That's why you see all this worship of the feds and how the feds are king and how great Lincoln is on the news to sell people on the idea they've got to put down a rebellion.
[00:40:29.335 --> 00:40:33.918]  The Pentagon, the Army War College, says NORTHCOM is a military jurisdiction over the U.S.
[00:40:34.785 --> 00:40:37.367]  set up for the design collapse of the U.S.
[00:40:37.367 --> 00:40:38.869]  to bring us into the New World Order.
[00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:42.812]  I mean, I've written all these articles linked to the Army War College, linked to their public directives.
[00:40:42.812 --> 00:40:43.893]  This is public!
[00:40:43.893 --> 00:40:45.354]  No more denying it!
[00:40:45.354 --> 00:40:55.423]  The military, just like a third world nation, is to be used as a rear guard to make the people stand down when the globalists extract our pension funds, our money, at the barrel of a gun.
[00:40:56.348 --> 00:41:00.591]  But as riots break out, they're going to sell us on that it's a good idea.
[00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:01.632]  It'll look good.
[00:41:01.632 --> 00:41:08.878]  The military will quell riots at first to set the precedent to sell everybody that that's how we stay safe.
[00:41:08.878 --> 00:41:11.740]  So, the answer is, what does NORTHCOM say?
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.682]  What does the John Warren Defense Authorization Act say?
[00:41:13.682 --> 00:41:14.483]  What does PD51 say?
[00:41:16.149 --> 00:41:21.613]  It says that not just the presidency is a dictatorship, but the Congress has no authority federally.
[00:41:21.613 --> 00:41:22.693]  Well, that's treason.
[00:41:22.693 --> 00:41:23.334]  That's ridiculous.
[00:41:23.334 --> 00:41:24.815]  The Congress is above the President.
[00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:25.555]  Not just co-equal.
[00:41:25.555 --> 00:41:28.817]  If you read the Founding Fathers statements and the record.
[00:41:28.817 --> 00:41:30.438]  Not just co-equal, but above.
[00:41:30.438 --> 00:41:33.100]  Well, they're saying the no, Congress under the President.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.081]  And the National Security Council.
[00:41:35.081 --> 00:41:41.406]  Mainline senators are now coming out and saying that this is a Pentagon power grab.
[00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:43.387]  West Virginia, Senator Byrd of all people.
[00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:45.716]  He's saying it's a Pentagon takeover.
[00:41:45.716 --> 00:41:47.317]  It is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:47.317 --> 00:41:50.560]  This happens 99% of the time in other countries.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:42:00.748]  I have a Council on Foreign Relations meeting that was public with top professors reading out of the Army War College about how they're going to have a military coup in the United States in the next three years.
[00:42:00.748 --> 00:42:02.410]  I'm going to get a guest on about that this week.
[00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.872]  I mean, that's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:42:04.872 --> 00:42:07.454]  This is being discussed everywhere.
[00:42:07.454 --> 00:42:10.677]  And the fact is that people are waking up means we can stop it.
[00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.243]  We don't go out and start shooting.
[00:42:13.243 --> 00:42:14.464]  We don't go out and start fighting.
[00:42:14.464 --> 00:42:17.967]  The military is waking up, those that aren't illegal aliens and felons.
[00:42:17.967 --> 00:42:19.468]  Literally, that's who they're hiring.
[00:42:19.468 --> 00:42:21.971]  The police are waking up all over the place.
[00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:23.051]  Sheriffs are waking up.
[00:42:23.051 --> 00:42:24.793]  Grand juries are waking up.
[00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:34.601]  And the states are saying, we're not going along with offshore banks coming in through the federal government and fully taking over the United States.
[00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:36.803]  Okay?
[00:42:36.803 --> 00:42:39.706]  So this is very, very exciting.
[00:42:42.352 --> 00:42:48.357]  Now the feds are pulling all sorts of scams like Bill seeks to withhold highway funds to states who don't comply with real ID.
[00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:49.618]  That's a world ID.
[00:42:49.618 --> 00:42:52.121]  A federal ID.
[00:42:52.121 --> 00:42:53.902]  So see, they're trying to put pressure on the states.
[00:42:53.902 --> 00:42:54.963]  It's treason.
[00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:56.484]  You have to get to your legislatures.
[00:42:56.484 --> 00:42:57.686]  You have to get involved.
[00:42:57.686 --> 00:42:59.827]  You have to tell the truth about what's happening.
[00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:08.195]  Because what's happening is so off the charts corrupt, so off the charts evil, that if we just expose how bad it is, they'll never get away with it.
[00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:09.316]  Many coups fail.
[00:43:10.353 --> 00:43:11.118]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:11.118 --> 00:43:11.560]  Stay with us.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.747]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[00:43:14.065 --> 00:43:18.989]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:26.435]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:43:26.435 --> 00:43:28.036]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:43:28.036 --> 00:43:32.200]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.023]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:43:36.023 --> 00:43:40.506]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:43:40.506 --> 00:43:42.468]  Phase 1 is a One World Currency.
[00:43:42.608 --> 00:43:44.830]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:48.932]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[00:43:48.932 --> 00:43:53.615]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[00:43:53.615 --> 00:43:57.238]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[00:47:29.036 --> 00:47:35.582]  Disposable heroes, ladies and gentlemen, the master of puppets.
[00:47:35.582 --> 00:47:42.108]  You know, a piece of cheese on a mousetrap looks really good to a mouse or a rat.
[00:47:42.108 --> 00:47:46.432]  That's all these kids rocking three doors down and all this Pentagon propaganda.
[00:47:46.432 --> 00:47:53.199]  They're now reporting 40 plus billion dollars a year is going to be spent domestically, internationally brainwashing the American people
[00:47:54.271 --> 00:48:00.876]  Building up the military, paying for rock stars and movie stars and movies to have product placement in them.
[00:48:00.876 --> 00:48:03.297]  Selling the military is God.
[00:48:03.297 --> 00:48:04.158]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[00:48:04.158 --> 00:48:14.705]  You're not in a free society when there's giant military ads everywhere and troops marching around and any excuse for troops to be in your life.
[00:48:14.705 --> 00:48:18.888]  They're gearing up for a total takeover of the U.S.
[00:48:18.888 --> 00:48:22.951]  What, you just think we could have this giant force and it wouldn't be used by interesting government to take over?
[00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:30.093]  George Washington twice was almost overthrown during a revolutionary war.
[00:48:30.093 --> 00:48:38.039]  Because his men and his generals wanted to have a coup d'etat and basically become kings.
[00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:41.122]  And it happened right when they won the war as well.
[00:48:41.122 --> 00:48:44.665]  And then it happened right after he left the presidency.
[00:48:44.665 --> 00:48:49.508]  And militias had to march on the Capitol to say we're not going to have a dictatorship.
[00:48:49.508 --> 00:48:51.290]  That's mainline history!
[00:48:53.246 --> 00:48:56.387]  Let me tell you, the people running our society today are no George Washingtons.
[00:48:56.387 --> 00:48:58.488]  They will not turn down the power.
[00:48:58.488 --> 00:49:01.910]  They will not leave after eight years and go back to their farm.
[00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.811]  You understand that?
[00:49:03.811 --> 00:49:06.772]  You understand that?
[00:49:06.772 --> 00:49:08.493]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[00:49:08.493 --> 00:49:09.733]  Let's talk to Don in Indiana.
[00:49:09.733 --> 00:49:11.634]  Don, you're on the air.
[00:49:11.634 --> 00:49:13.055]  Hey, Comrade Alex, how are you?
[00:49:13.055 --> 00:49:13.935]  Comrade, yes!
[00:49:14.764 --> 00:49:21.729]  Hey, I kind of just remember back in the Clinton era, you know, this tax cut where I got to keep $3 out of my check each week.
[00:49:21.729 --> 00:49:26.992]  It's $156 here, but at the end of the year I had to pay $450 back, you know.
[00:49:26.992 --> 00:49:31.675]  I was in Evansville, Indiana yesterday, and they've got these new electronic billboards everywhere.
[00:49:31.675 --> 00:49:35.138]  One ad is a commercial, the next ad is a wanted poster for somebody.
[00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:38.340]  Then a commercial, then a wanted poster.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.262]  And also in the London Times deal, you know, the nuke in the U.S.
[00:49:42.262 --> 00:49:42.423]  on 620.
[00:49:43.852 --> 00:49:54.538]  If you do 6-20-2009 to 2000, or excuse me, to 12-20-2012, it's exactly three and a half years, because we're moving into the Second Tribulation.
[00:49:54.538 --> 00:49:56.039]  That's all I got.
[00:49:56.039 --> 00:49:58.320]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.763]  Have you ever seen The Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura?
[00:50:03.763 --> 00:50:10.867]  In The Running Man, it starts with the image of a city and militarized police on street corners.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.883]  And big billboards saying we're looking for wanted people.
[00:50:14.883 --> 00:50:18.026]  And be sure and have your ID card.
[00:50:18.026 --> 00:50:24.952]  See, first, under federal funds, they put in these billboards to quote, look for lost Alzheimer's patients and kidnapped children.
[00:50:24.952 --> 00:50:31.017]  Now they say report illegal guns, creating the perception that guns are illegal when they're not.
[00:50:31.017 --> 00:50:34.360]  Or, call this hotline to report terrorism.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.223]  And they're training all the police departments to look for roadside bombs.
[00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:39.371]  Now, there's a box on the side of the road.
[00:50:39.371 --> 00:50:40.772]  They shut the highway down.
[00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:42.333]  Everybody panics.
[00:50:42.333 --> 00:50:49.719]  This is so we're all scared and fearful and accept the good men in black uniforms saving us.
[00:50:49.719 --> 00:50:54.743]  When the good guys in black uniforms actually work for the terrorists that own and run the country.
[00:50:54.743 --> 00:50:57.545]  It's very simple.
[00:50:57.545 --> 00:51:00.387]  What would the Mafia do a hundred and something years ago in New York?
[00:51:00.387 --> 00:51:01.448]  Or Chicago?
[00:51:01.448 --> 00:51:03.049]  Or New Jersey?
[00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:07.272]  They would come to you and say, somebody's gonna burn your grocery store down or your laundry mat.
[00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.632]  Or your tannery.
[00:51:10.632 --> 00:51:13.975]  If you don't pay me, insurance.
[00:51:13.975 --> 00:51:16.157]  And if you didn't pay, they'd burn you out.
[00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:17.558]  Well, that's the globalist.
[00:51:17.558 --> 00:51:20.100]  Give us your rights or terrorists are going to get you.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.582]  It's very, very simple.
[00:51:22.582 --> 00:51:26.105]  And if you keep living in denial, folks, they're going to win.
[00:51:26.105 --> 00:51:27.607]  Period.
[00:51:27.607 --> 00:51:29.648]  Yes, this is the police state.
[00:51:29.648 --> 00:51:31.350]  This is the classic Orwellville.
[00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:34.617]  My wife was in Barnes and Nobles.
[00:51:34.617 --> 00:51:36.258]  I've seen this online, but she witnessed it.
[00:51:36.258 --> 00:51:40.359]  Just giant children's sections on Obama and giant posters of Obama.
[00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:42.799]  It's like Nazi Germany or something.
[00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:44.180]  But again, he's just a front man.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.840]  The point is the establishment's making him a messianic leader.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.180]  Dan in Alaska, you're on the air.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.041]  Hey, Alex.
[00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:54.422]  I just want to thank you for everything that you do, man.
[00:51:54.422 --> 00:51:58.863]  I'm in the military, number one, and I actually am a member of
[00:52:00.057 --> 00:52:01.438]  I've got a question for you about sovereignty.
[00:52:01.438 --> 00:52:03.620]  Number one, I do understand that if 34 states get together
[00:52:24.643 --> 00:52:32.785]  Uh, that it can actually overthrow the federal government, which I pray that it happens, because it needs to happen, and fast.
[00:52:32.785 --> 00:52:39.646]  But, um, a kind of a concern I've got, what if that is in their plans?
[00:52:39.646 --> 00:52:48.848]  What if the globalists have already thought about this and are planning on this so they can use, like, the divide and conquer type of theory?
[00:52:48.848 --> 00:52:49.829]  What do you think?
[00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:51.569]  Well, you're at a very astute point, sir.
[00:52:53.035 --> 00:52:56.680]  First off, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:02.749]  But the establishment is going to build sovereignty being declared as secession.
[00:53:02.749 --> 00:53:07.636]  We're not saying have the states secede like what happened with the Confederacy.
[00:53:09.024 --> 00:53:14.029]  We're saying the states can abolish or change the federal government in any way they wish.
[00:53:14.029 --> 00:53:15.830]  That's the 9th and 10th Amendment, folks.
[00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.472]  It's in the Constitution.
[00:53:17.472 --> 00:53:19.113]  They've taught school kids that's not the case.
[00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:23.618]  It is an absolute, inviolate fact that cannot be violated.
[00:53:23.618 --> 00:53:24.638]  It is the reality
[00:53:25.759 --> 00:53:27.880]  But yes, in any course, there is danger.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:36.561]  That's why it's so good that now 30 states are passing, or on the verge of passing, 9th and 10th Amendment declarations that are specific.
[00:53:36.561 --> 00:53:38.222]  We're not leaving the Union.
[00:53:38.222 --> 00:53:41.382]  We are declaring sovereignty under the 10th and 9th Amendment.
[00:53:41.382 --> 00:53:50.204]  And then, New Hampshire and other states state, if you continue, we're going to move for the states to vote to abolish you and for investigations to arrest you.
[00:53:51.264 --> 00:53:53.126]  See, so that's how this works.
[00:53:53.126 --> 00:53:59.771]  And so, as long as the message is constitutional, will there be some control freaks and bad guys, low-level, that try to take control?
[00:53:59.771 --> 00:54:00.471]  That always happens.
[00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:05.275]  But let me add, we have to do this now, because the globalists create regional governments.
[00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:08.117]  They're creating the North American Union, Mexico, Canada, the U.S.
[00:54:08.117 --> 00:54:16.964]  Then they do plan on breaking apart into ethnic enclaves, the Southwest, this is on record, and other areas that will be controlled by regional paramilitary forces.
[00:54:16.964 --> 00:54:20.567]  So, they plan, through the 10 FEMA regions, to break up the U.S.,
[00:54:21.247 --> 00:54:27.317]  The federal government's already fallen to offshore intrigue and banking takeover through espionage publicly.
[00:54:27.317 --> 00:54:28.739]  That's what this New World Order is.
[00:54:28.739 --> 00:54:30.061]  So, it's already gone.
[00:54:30.061 --> 00:54:34.488]  We must have the states do this to reconstitute the Republic.
[00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:36.445]  Nice.
[00:54:36.445 --> 00:54:37.746]  Okay, yeah, awesome.
[00:54:37.746 --> 00:54:42.209]  And I just want to, you know, a couple of callers ago, he was saying, uh, what's your plan?
[00:54:42.209 --> 00:54:43.810]  You know, this is already, it's already happened.
[00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:45.531]  He's basically saying it's too late.
[00:54:45.531 --> 00:54:47.492]  Ain't wrong, it's not too late.
[00:54:47.492 --> 00:54:50.534]  And thinking like that will allow this to happen.
[00:54:50.534 --> 00:54:54.156]  People, you got to realize that they work for us.
[00:54:54.156 --> 00:54:55.797]  We do not work for them.
[00:54:56.497 --> 00:55:00.180]  You're governor, you're the legislature, all them people work for us.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.942]  That's right, let me stop you, you're absolutely right.
[00:55:01.942 --> 00:55:04.264]  It's a mind trick that we can't resist.
[00:55:04.264 --> 00:55:05.845]  They've been moving to take over the U.S.
[00:55:05.845 --> 00:55:07.747]  because they're scared of the American people.
[00:55:07.747 --> 00:55:12.251]  They know we could take the government back and bring these bankers that have looted us and robbed us by design.
[00:55:12.251 --> 00:55:15.013]  This isn't an accident to justice, but getting back to the military.
[00:55:15.533 --> 00:55:16.794]  I haven't started this initiative.
[00:55:16.794 --> 00:55:22.596]  Listeners have started the initiative to send to NORTHCOM and National Guard troops now under NORTHCOM my videos.
[00:55:22.596 --> 00:55:24.037]  Make copies of them, get them out.
[00:55:24.037 --> 00:55:26.318]  There's a video up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:26.318 --> 00:55:28.299]  It's AlexJones2012.com.
[00:55:28.299 --> 00:55:29.560]  I'm not saying I'm running for president.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.860]  Somebody else wants this.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:36.323]  But the issue is the fact that they're... Look, if we educate the military and police and show them
[00:55:36.783 --> 00:55:37.003]  Absolutely.
[00:55:37.003 --> 00:55:38.123]  You know, hallelujah, you're absolutely correct.
[00:55:38.123 --> 00:55:40.044]  We have guns for a reason, people.
[00:55:40.044 --> 00:55:42.104]  If you want 50 bucks, send me your guns.
[00:55:42.104 --> 00:55:43.225]  I'll give you 50 bucks.
[00:55:43.225 --> 00:55:44.505]  I put that on Craigslist.
[00:55:44.505 --> 00:55:45.005]  $100 for your guns.
[00:55:45.005 --> 00:55:45.985]  No questions asked.
[00:55:45.985 --> 00:55:46.525]  I got two hits.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:14.183]  So, I'm going to disperse them, I'll spread them back out there and keep them out there to the people that want to use them and want to express their Second Amendment, right?
[00:56:14.183 --> 00:56:16.664]  Because once we lose that, we're done.
[00:56:16.664 --> 00:56:17.824]  That's it, we're done.
[00:56:17.824 --> 00:56:25.246]  And another thing that really pisses me off is these people talking about how the Earth is so overpopulated, blah blah blah, whatever.
[00:56:25.246 --> 00:56:26.347]  Check this out.
[00:56:26.347 --> 00:56:30.288]  There is 2.9 million miles in Australia.
[00:56:30.288 --> 00:56:31.068]  There's 640 acres in one mile.
[00:56:33.459 --> 00:56:38.742]  So if you multiply those numbers, you get 1.8 billion acres.
[00:56:38.742 --> 00:56:41.623]  Alright, let's take that down to quarter acres.
[00:56:41.623 --> 00:56:45.125]  That's 7.5 billion quarter acres.
[00:56:45.125 --> 00:56:46.946]  How many people are there in the world again, Alex?
[00:56:46.946 --> 00:56:48.426]  A little over 6 billion, right?
[00:56:48.426 --> 00:56:52.148]  Well, number one, the population is going to plane off at 8.5 billion.
[00:56:52.148 --> 00:56:53.529]  That's all the government's own numbers.
[00:56:54.831 --> 00:57:05.498]  Again, they're teaching us that we don't have resources so they can come in and tax and regulate every facet of our lives by taxing the carbon system of the planet, the carbon cycle.
[00:57:05.498 --> 00:57:07.280]  It is the most dastardly plan ever.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.861]  But look, let me ask you this.
[00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:10.662]  We've educated the military and police.
[00:57:10.662 --> 00:57:11.823]  We told them all this was coming.
[00:57:11.823 --> 00:57:12.744]  A lot of them laughed.
[00:57:12.744 --> 00:57:17.127]  Now they're all waking up, literally, because so much of what we said has now come true.
[00:57:17.127 --> 00:57:19.749]  When you talk to folks up there in the military, are they waking up?
[00:57:21.175 --> 00:57:22.516]  Oh, yeah.
[00:57:22.516 --> 00:57:28.783]  I've got one guy that sits here and fights me on, you know, the difference between creation and evolution.
[00:57:28.783 --> 00:57:29.864]  It's all evolution.
[00:57:29.864 --> 00:57:30.444]  Oh, really?
[00:57:30.444 --> 00:57:33.567]  Then why is it everything that they've always shown has always been false?
[00:57:33.567 --> 00:57:38.152]  But yet, when he sits there and he watches your shows, he has nothing to say.
[00:57:38.152 --> 00:57:41.375]  I even asked him the other night, I was like, what do you think about this stuff?
[00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:42.256]  I don't know.
[00:57:42.256 --> 00:57:44.278]  He says, you know, you're just sitting here, you're showing them
[00:57:45.118 --> 00:57:58.849]  Their own documents like you always preach their own documents and Exactly so like civilian inmate labor camp program army dot mil secret FEMA camps built now They admit it with Americans already in them.
[00:57:58.849 --> 00:58:03.173]  God bless you my friend second hour straight ahead after the news and important announcements Stay with us

[00:58:37.685 --> 00:58:43.729]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:46.230]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.873]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.

[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.160]  Check your watch.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.342]  It is now 5 o'clock.
[01:00:18.457 --> 01:00:21.499]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[01:00:21.499 --> 01:00:23.701]  Officials in Pakistan say suspected U.S.
[01:00:23.701 --> 01:00:27.604]  missile strikes have killed seven people in a Taliban stronghold.
[01:00:27.604 --> 01:00:28.784]  Here's Nahal Tusi.
[01:00:28.784 --> 01:00:36.790]  We don't know yet if there are any foreign militants among the dead, and oftentimes when there are foreigners killed, they are often connected to Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:42.674]  Meanwhile, a military convoy carrying a sick soldier has been attacked elsewhere in Pakistan.
[01:00:42.674 --> 01:00:43.935]  Two soldiers were wounded.
[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:49.252]  And forecasters say the East Coast is about to get hit by a major winter storm.
[01:00:49.252 --> 01:00:52.433]  Snow has already fallen in Alabama and Georgia.
[01:00:52.433 --> 01:00:57.755]  Brian Cordy is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service and says the storm carries a lot of snow.
[01:00:57.755 --> 01:01:06.779]  For the most part, I think the average nose for most of the area in the heaviest part of this storm will probably be anywhere from about 6 inches to about 10 inches of snow.
[01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:11.441]  He also says 15 inches or more could be expected in southern New England.
[01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:13.662]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.003]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[01:01:19.003 --> 01:01:20.684]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[01:01:20.684 --> 01:01:23.105]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods, and processed foods.
[01:01:23.105 --> 01:01:25.627]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[01:01:25.627 --> 01:01:27.789]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today?
[01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:29.090]  Or do you have this bloated feeling?
[01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:32.192]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[01:01:32.192 --> 01:01:34.854]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.
[01:01:34.994 --> 01:01:44.776]  It's called EverCleanse, a clinically proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you lose weight and get rid of the 5 to 25 pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[01:01:44.776 --> 01:01:47.096]  Two weeks of EverCleanse may be equal to months of dieting.
[01:01:47.096 --> 01:01:47.856]  It's simple, too.
[01:01:47.856 --> 01:01:50.477]  Natural, tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage.
[01:01:50.477 --> 01:01:55.138]  EverCleanse will flatten out your midsection, reduce love handles, and bellies and bloating have been disappearing in just days.
[01:01:55.138 --> 01:01:59.699]  You see, EverCleanse gets rid of the weight you can't take off by exercising or starving yourself on a diet.
[01:01:59.699 --> 01:02:01.459]  And it's not something you have to take for the rest of your life.
[01:02:01.459 --> 01:02:04.002]  European Union leaders are opposing a new multi-billion bailout for Eastern Europe.
[01:02:20.734 --> 01:02:31.099]  The EU Commission President says Eastern European countries have already been getting billions in emergency rescue funds from the EU, the World Bank and other financial institutions.
[01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:33.960]  He says they don't need a new bailout plan.

[01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:09.134]  The 24-cent Air Mail stamp features a Curtis JN-4 Jenny biplane, but was mistakenly printed upside down.

[01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:57.131]  I think this proposal will get enacted.
[01:03:57.131 --> 01:04:03.094]  The $410 billion measure would keep the government operating through September 30th, the end of the current budget year.
[01:04:03.094 --> 01:04:09.478]  A watchdog group says the measure includes nearly $8 billion in earmarks, which Obama campaigned against.

[01:04:21.768 --> 01:04:27.651]  I'm a little bit reluctant to talk specifically about winning and losing.
[01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:30.013]  We've turned it around over the last few years.
[01:04:30.013 --> 01:04:34.095]  He told Fox that Baghdad will be able to successfully take control of the country.

[01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:59.839]  To eye-cross zoo in central England has been overwhelmed by the job hunters who caused a five-mile traffic jam when they all arrived for Saturday's recruitment day in response to an ad for temporary cleaners

[01:06:58.672 --> 01:07:02.455]  And then I'm going to get into Guns for Cash buyback program.
[01:07:02.455 --> 01:07:08.719]  This is from usaservice.org, the federal government involved with Obama's private organizations doing anti-gun events all over the country.
[01:07:09.597 --> 01:07:14.181]  Eric Holder's announced they are going to introduce a new assault ban and call for physical banning.
[01:07:14.181 --> 01:07:17.623]  It means you have to hand them in.
[01:07:17.623 --> 01:07:21.847]  And he also wants another law passed where he can ban guns at will himself.
[01:07:21.847 --> 01:07:26.430]  National registration, national, federally, psychological testing to have guns.
[01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:28.172]  It's all happening ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:28.172 --> 01:07:32.555]  High treason against the Republic and this once free country.
[01:07:32.555 --> 01:07:34.677]  So that is coming up.
[01:07:34.677 --> 01:07:37.039]  You know I can't believe I have to explain this to some folks but
[01:07:38.066 --> 01:07:43.829]  The IMF and World Bank are private holding houses for private central banks that control nations, that didn't earn the money.
[01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:51.073]  They bought off nations' governments and let the governments hand over control of their issuance of currency and credit to them.
[01:07:51.073 --> 01:07:52.494]  Then they buy up the world.
[01:07:52.494 --> 01:07:56.976]  But they want real assets, not enough to just have mountains of fiat currency.
[01:07:56.976 --> 01:07:59.797]  They then get everybody in debt, blow out the economy.
[01:07:59.797 --> 01:08:04.800]  In a real economy, you couldn't just in a few months go from a recession into a depression and everybody losing their jobs.
[01:08:05.427 --> 01:08:06.528]  This is globalism.
[01:08:06.528 --> 01:08:08.528]  This is how they get you dependent on them.
[01:08:08.528 --> 01:08:09.649]  They brag about it.
[01:08:09.649 --> 01:08:11.650]  They write textbooks on it.
[01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:14.251]  And I challenge folks to look at Iceland.
[01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:16.252]  One of the most wealthy countries in the world.
[01:08:16.252 --> 01:08:18.133]  Right there with Switzerland.
[01:08:18.133 --> 01:08:20.074]  Above the United States in a matter of months.
[01:08:20.074 --> 01:08:21.734]  Basically everybody's bankrupt.
[01:08:21.734 --> 01:08:24.315]  Food is bare on most of the shelves at the stores.
[01:08:24.315 --> 01:08:25.516]  People have been rioting for months.
[01:08:25.516 --> 01:08:28.557]  But it doesn't matter how many governments they take out of power.
[01:08:28.557 --> 01:08:29.898]  Their government's falling there.
[01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:31.539]  Governments are falling in Europe.
[01:08:31.539 --> 01:08:32.879]  Because the bankers already own it all.
[01:08:32.879 --> 01:08:34.380]  They're offshore and they control the military.
[01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:39.025]  The government can stand up and say, stop what you're doing, and they say, hey, we have the military!
[01:08:39.025 --> 01:08:41.946]  Because it's controlled under national security systems.
[01:08:41.946 --> 01:08:42.626]  Separate.
[01:08:42.626 --> 01:08:48.209]  Just like England, you know, they catch the MI5 spying on the parliament that supposedly runs the government.
[01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:49.609]  They run nothing!
[01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:56.012]  The continuity of government system was set up by the banks in the last 80 years in Western Europe and the U.S.
[01:08:56.012 --> 01:08:59.294]  So they can go around government.
[01:08:59.294 --> 01:09:01.315]  You've just got to stand up and say, this is illegitimate.
[01:09:01.315 --> 01:09:02.975]  The emperor is butt naked.
[01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:04.316]  The emperor has no clothes.
[01:09:06.485 --> 01:09:07.725]  Look at Argentina, folks.
[01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:14.248]  They were first world, as wealthy as the U.S., most wealthy nation in Central and South America.
[01:09:14.248 --> 01:09:21.210]  Overnight, the bankers came in, they dollarized, they let the bankers get them in debt, set up the system, the IMF World Bank documents came out in 2001.
[01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:29.352]  A year after, how they engineered the collapse, how they cut off the water and power to cause riots, how they, to destroy confidence.
[01:09:29.352 --> 01:09:34.414]  Then the bankers would come in, buy up everything, and the people are still in a depression nine years later.
[01:09:35.236 --> 01:09:36.517]  They're going to do that here.
[01:09:36.517 --> 01:09:38.077]  They're doing that here.
[01:09:38.077 --> 01:09:43.000]  And if you won't stand up and speak out against it, look in the mirror as things get worse.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:43.940]  But I know a lot of you won't.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.942]  You'll look at the government and hold your hand out and get your little national ID card.
[01:09:46.942 --> 01:09:53.025]  They'll put welfare creds on and you'll join the little tattletale squads and wear little uniforms.
[01:09:53.025 --> 01:09:55.106]  We're not just going into a third world despotism.
[01:09:55.106 --> 01:09:56.706]  We're going into a high-tech tyranny.
[01:09:56.706 --> 01:09:59.828]  It'll be worse than Argentina.
[01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:02.029]  Let's talk to Ed in Texas.
[01:10:02.029 --> 01:10:03.570]  In Austin, Texas to be precise.
[01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:03.930]  Ed, you're on.
[01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:07.326]  Hi Alex, good to hear you.
[01:10:07.326 --> 01:10:09.708]  Welcome.
[01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:16.331]  Kudos to that guy up in Alaska, and kudos to you of course.
[01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:18.592]  I just can't believe what I'm seeing, man.
[01:10:18.592 --> 01:10:27.197]  This guy is just giving the NWO a violent show in overdrive, man.
[01:10:27.197 --> 01:10:29.559]  The speed that this thing is picking up is unbelievable.
[01:10:31.851 --> 01:10:36.295]  I personally just heard something Friday at work that was pretty disturbing.
[01:10:36.295 --> 01:10:41.140]  Something, uh, mandatory payroll, uh, direct deposit.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.781]  Yes.
[01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:47.305]  They're doing that to get you ready to do mandatory 401k so they can steal your money as well.
[01:10:47.305 --> 01:10:48.086]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:48.086 --> 01:10:53.490]  I mean, you know, I thought I was working to support myself.
[01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:56.353]  This is, sir, Homeland Security stated on C-SPAN.
[01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.615]  I'll never forget six years ago when Governor Ridge was the head.
[01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:00.202]  Absolutely, that's what's happening.
[01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:30.550]  What was it in the good book that it said that you won't be able to barter or trade or anything without this mark?
[01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:33.631]  Let he who has understanding reckon the number of the beast.
[01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:38.073]  Four to six hundred and sixty-six, you will neither buy nor sell without it.
[01:11:38.073 --> 01:11:42.095]  Whether he be great or small, all will have to use it.
[01:11:42.095 --> 01:11:42.635]  Right.
[01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:46.017]  To all the Patriots out there listening, get ready to stand and deliver.
[01:11:46.017 --> 01:11:46.878]  We're going to have to.
[01:11:46.878 --> 01:11:48.178]  God bless you and keep you, Alex.
[01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:48.859]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:48.859 --> 01:11:49.479]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:50.219]  Yeah, God bless you.
[01:11:50.219 --> 01:11:51.800]  The problem is homeland security.
[01:11:52.589 --> 01:11:57.252]  Under the clergy response team is paying secretly, now it's public, but it was secret.
[01:11:57.252 --> 01:12:03.155]  Think how dastardly, how wicked, how aggressive that is.
[01:12:03.155 --> 01:12:04.336]  How arbitrary.
[01:12:04.336 --> 01:12:07.998]  Just like they take your baby's blood for 36 years at birth and don't tell you now it's mainstream news.
[01:12:07.998 --> 01:12:09.439]  Put it in the DNA database.
[01:12:09.439 --> 01:12:10.059]  They're criminals.
[01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.940]  That was a violation of law every time.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.001]  The government is rogue.
[01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:16.583]  They bought off the preachers and so they're going to stand down.
[01:12:17.293 --> 01:12:24.897]  They've been told not just stand down during this, they're going to tell their flock, oh Jesus is coming, stand down, go to the FEMA camps, take the shots, turn your guns in.
[01:12:24.897 --> 01:12:28.199]  That's what they're, we have the documents, that's what they're told to teach.
[01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:35.983]  You don't think the feds are out of control when they train 26,000 preachers in every town and city to run out and tell everybody stand down when this is happening?
[01:12:35.983 --> 01:12:41.485]  That is espionage, that is covert operation, that is, they have taken their time setting us up to fall.
[01:12:41.485 --> 01:12:42.266]  Do you understand?
[01:12:44.386 --> 01:12:47.287]  Let's talk to Maury in Cedar Park, also in Austin, Texas.
[01:12:47.287 --> 01:12:48.507]  Go ahead.
[01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:52.507]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:12:52.507 --> 01:12:58.668]  I thought you were a kook about two years ago, and now you've won me over completely.
[01:12:58.668 --> 01:13:00.969]  But I do have to ask you one question.
[01:13:00.969 --> 01:13:08.850]  What is the underlying foundation for how you become so adroit?
[01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.231]  That's one thing I don't understand.
[01:13:11.231 --> 01:13:12.671]  Why are you so
[01:13:14.297 --> 01:13:15.658]  Uh, history.
[01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:17.379]  History, sir.
[01:13:17.379 --> 01:13:25.924]  I'm sure you've heard the cliche that the more things change, the more they stay the same, or that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it, or Lord Acton power tends to corrupt.
[01:13:25.924 --> 01:13:28.726]  Power cribs have to, uh, absolutely.
[01:13:28.726 --> 01:13:36.951]  I happened, when I was about 12, 13, 14, to start reading history books because they were much more entertaining than science fiction or Louis L'Amour.
[01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:38.412]  Okay, I've always been an avid reader.
[01:13:38.412 --> 01:13:43.455]  When you read Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, when you read hundreds of books,
[01:13:44.261 --> 01:13:47.122]  Many of them written by people like Julius Caesar.
[01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:49.263]  I read Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[01:13:49.263 --> 01:13:49.944]  My struggle.
[01:13:49.944 --> 01:13:56.507]  When you read what these people have said, then you know what it is when history is repeating.
[01:13:56.507 --> 01:13:58.788]  Then I read government documents, sir.
[01:13:58.788 --> 01:14:05.091]  The RAND Corporation, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the Club of Rome, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:14:05.091 --> 01:14:07.352]  They all write books and publications.
[01:14:07.352 --> 01:14:08.893]  I mean, one book.
[01:14:08.893 --> 01:14:11.694]  Men in Power is a political retrospective, one of hundreds I could plug.
[01:14:12.395 --> 01:14:15.456]  Written by Helmut Schmidt, former German Chancellor.
[01:14:15.456 --> 01:14:16.737]  Okay?
[01:14:16.737 --> 01:14:17.877]  Well, I have a follow-up question.
[01:14:17.877 --> 01:14:18.217]  No, no, no.
[01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:18.598]  Hold on.
[01:14:18.598 --> 01:14:20.478]  He says we're setting up a world government.
[01:14:20.478 --> 01:14:22.099]  He says they're going to bankrupt all of us.
[01:14:22.099 --> 01:14:23.940]  He wrote this in the early 90s.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:28.021]  He says that they are setting up all this stuff.
[01:14:28.021 --> 01:14:28.702]  He's for it.
[01:14:28.702 --> 01:14:29.002]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:30.742]  Go ahead.
[01:14:30.742 --> 01:14:40.386]  My question is, then, what you're saying is that you have to have a certain level of intelligence to make it in this world.
[01:14:40.386 --> 01:14:41.987]  Otherwise, you know,
[01:14:42.722 --> 01:14:45.464]  Not.
[01:14:45.464 --> 01:14:46.785]  Most people are intelligent.
[01:14:46.785 --> 01:14:52.449]  They are distracted by football and acting cool and just trying to make it every day and taking care of their children.
[01:14:52.449 --> 01:14:55.252]  And they've decided, America's just a playland.
[01:14:55.252 --> 01:14:57.073]  I just go to the mall, go to work.
[01:14:57.073 --> 01:14:58.614]  You know, I accept my environment.
[01:14:58.614 --> 01:15:01.156]  I don't interact with my environment.
[01:15:01.156 --> 01:15:04.879]  And they've decided it's weird to be involved or weird to be informed.
[01:15:04.879 --> 01:15:05.139]  Okay?
[01:15:06.782 --> 01:15:08.564]  Can I just add one other comment?
[01:15:08.564 --> 01:15:12.187]  Then I'll hang up.
[01:15:12.187 --> 01:15:15.650]  I am so appreciative of you.
[01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:19.254]  I am in awe, and I thank you.
[01:15:19.254 --> 01:15:21.856]  And that's about it.
[01:15:21.856 --> 01:15:22.677]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:15:22.677 --> 01:15:23.317]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:23.317 --> 01:15:25.019]  Please don't be in awe of me, sir.
[01:15:26.497 --> 01:15:42.511]  When I found out the Army and the Marines were creeping around Texas paying off police chiefs, sheriffs, mayors, fire chiefs, emergency managers, and I went and interviewed police chiefs and emergency managers and put it on local cable access TV and put it on my local FM show and then my syndicated show.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.741]  And people laughed at me.
[01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:46.101]  I said, why are you laughing?
[01:15:46.101 --> 01:15:47.843]  I just interviewed the police chief.
[01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:51.865]  There's a covert secret military operation to overthrow the U.S.
[01:15:51.865 --> 01:15:53.906]  just like they've done in third world countries.
[01:15:53.906 --> 01:15:59.850]  And from there I began to research and study and I didn't know as much as I do 10 years ago.
[01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:00.110]  Okay?
[01:16:01.277 --> 01:16:04.020]  You know, I thought that they could be getting ready to do it then.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.224]  No, no, they've taken long term to do this.
[01:16:07.224 --> 01:16:08.665]  Now they're announcing it.
[01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:11.529]  That's the final phase, because they announce it right before they do it.
[01:16:11.529 --> 01:16:13.150]  They're not denying any of it anymore.
[01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:15.293]  They're getting ready to move.
[01:16:15.293 --> 01:16:18.456]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[01:16:18.456 --> 01:16:20.719]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[01:16:21.354 --> 01:16:25.616]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[01:16:25.616 --> 01:16:30.999]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.

[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.601]  Ted Anderson from Midas, February 27, 2009.
[01:18:16.601 --> 01:18:19.984]  Gold 958 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $9.8532, $4.9266 for half, $2.4633 for quarter.
[01:18:19.984 --> 01:18:20.445]  That's $9.8532, $4.9266, and $2.4633.
[01:18:32.879 --> 01:18:34.180]  We all want liberty.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.542]  Some give their lives for it.
[01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:37.543]  A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[01:18:37.543 --> 01:18:39.805]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom.
[01:18:39.805 --> 01:18:40.546]  For what?
[01:18:40.546 --> 01:18:46.391]  February 28th, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown.
[01:18:46.391 --> 01:18:49.414]  Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression.
[01:18:49.594 --> 01:18:50.114]  We're good to go.
[01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:15.680]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.422]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:19:17.422 --> 01:19:20.104]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:19:20.104 --> 01:19:25.248]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:19:25.248 --> 01:19:28.431]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:31.934]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:26.087]  Yeah!
[01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:35.032]  We are back live!
[01:20:35.032 --> 01:20:39.294]  We're gonna defend the Republic!
[01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:41.495]  Globalists think they're taking down the USA.
[01:20:41.495 --> 01:20:43.997]  They love to rap while they're tearing the American flag.
[01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:56.692]  Don't you understand that that's a military tactic for the enemy to cloak themselves, to put on your uniforms, our uniform of the red, white, and blue?
[01:20:56.692 --> 01:21:14.155]  If they violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and go after the Second Amendment and let foreign bankers loot us by design, they are treasonous, traitorous usurpers!
[01:21:14.155 --> 01:21:14.875]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:15.815]  I'm going to get into more news.
[01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:20.950]  You know, I'm going to go back to something briefly.
[01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:28.995]  You know, Jason Bermas has moved down here and he's going to start a new radio show out of my studios on the Genesis Network, 9 to midnight central.
[01:21:28.995 --> 01:21:35.160]  And it's a test show tomorrow night, but it officially starts Tuesday on the 3rd.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.421]  And, you know, you think Jason knows everything.
[01:21:37.421 --> 01:21:38.242]  You think I know everything.
[01:21:38.242 --> 01:21:38.902]  I don't.
[01:21:38.902 --> 01:21:40.043]  You guys give me tips.
[01:21:40.043 --> 01:21:41.163]  We give him tips.
[01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:43.105]  It's constant research.
[01:21:43.105 --> 01:21:44.726]  I can't pull myself away from the research.
[01:21:44.726 --> 01:21:46.467]  I'm learning so much more exponentially every day.
[01:21:46.963 --> 01:21:52.867]  He walks in last Thursday at the office, and he says, Alex, look at this, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:54.708]  This is directly off the Army's website.
[01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:56.569]  They've had secret camps since 86.
[01:21:56.569 --> 01:21:57.389]  Look, read it.
[01:21:57.389 --> 01:21:58.530]  And they declassified it in 97.
[01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:06.175]  I said, Jason, that's in my book, Dissent and Tyranny, published 2002, with the Army website link.
[01:22:06.175 --> 01:22:07.876]  And he goes, really?
[01:22:07.876 --> 01:22:10.077]  I didn't know they were admitting it.
[01:22:10.077 --> 01:22:11.698]  See, don't think I know everything.
[01:22:11.698 --> 01:22:12.899]  Don't think Jason knows everything.
[01:22:12.899 --> 01:22:14.200]  We all are learning here.
[01:22:15.854 --> 01:22:22.900]  Now I think about my life and the things growing up, the books I happened to crack open and read and the journeys that led me on.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.581]  I'm still pretty young.
[01:22:23.581 --> 01:22:24.461]  I'm 35 now.
[01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:26.303]  I turned 35 a few weeks ago.
[01:22:26.303 --> 01:22:30.386]  I got involved in this when I was 21.
[01:22:30.386 --> 01:22:31.427]  21, folks.
[01:22:31.427 --> 01:22:32.168]  Got on the air when I was 22.
[01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:43.063]  You know, a lot of people criticize what I say and do, or they nitpick, or they try to invent things that I've done, or twist things.
[01:22:43.063 --> 01:22:47.084]  And people... I just want you to know it doesn't matter, because I know I've done the right thing.
[01:22:47.084 --> 01:22:48.524]  I know I'm a good person.
[01:22:48.524 --> 01:22:50.064]  I know I'm for real.
[01:22:50.064 --> 01:22:56.265]  You know, the biggest thing they take away from us as a society is that there aren't good people, and there aren't folks that will stand up and fight back.
[01:22:56.265 --> 01:23:04.607]  The majority of people are good, they're just lazy, they're distracted, they're diverted, and they don't want to believe the truth, because that kind of messes up their happy little illusion.
[01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:09.360]  But I want it on record that it has been a great honor.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.941]  And I hope I live to be 100 years old, but it's been a great honor.
[01:23:11.941 --> 01:23:19.824]  You know, if I was going home today and died in a car wreck, or if the feds set me up, or somebody, whatever, I'm getting a lot of death threats lately.
[01:23:19.824 --> 01:23:26.387]  I don't want people to feel bad for me, and that to be a sad thing, I want that to be a good thing.
[01:23:26.387 --> 01:23:32.289]  That's what Thomas Jefferson said, the blood of patriots and tyrants has to water the tree of liberty.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:38.524]  And folks are always calling me, always emailing me, hey this person's attacking you, that person's attacking you.
[01:23:38.524 --> 01:23:40.125]  Oh Alex, you've got to defend yourself.
[01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:42.807]  Look, that's part of the wreckage of society.
[01:23:42.807 --> 01:23:48.071]  That's part of weak-minded people, jealous people, envious people.
[01:23:48.071 --> 01:23:50.753]  Don't let that be a distraction or a diversion to you.
[01:23:50.753 --> 01:23:53.996]  We're in the greatest point of change in history.
[01:23:54.261 --> 01:24:01.744]  Where the tyranny is attempting to set up a worldwide scientific dictatorship, but at the same time, humanity is waking up and resisting it everywhere.
[01:24:01.744 --> 01:24:05.225]  I don't have words to describe to you how this radio show is exploding.
[01:24:05.225 --> 01:24:08.686]  I don't have words to describe, and I'm just one little guy in this fight.
[01:24:08.686 --> 01:24:10.767]  It's because of you, the listeners.
[01:24:10.767 --> 01:24:15.028]  I was looking on our web statistics last night from our two biggest CDN servers.
[01:24:15.028 --> 01:24:20.570]  Guess how many, in the last year, guess how many hits InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com have had?
[01:24:23.766 --> 01:24:25.668]  Billion.
[01:24:25.668 --> 01:24:28.770]  Ten billion.
[01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:34.195]  And over a hundred and seventy million individual visitors.
[01:24:34.195 --> 01:24:35.136]  And that isn't hype, folks.
[01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.777]  That's the real numbers.
[01:24:36.777 --> 01:24:41.141]  One hundred and seventy million different IP addresses.
[01:24:41.141 --> 01:24:42.302]  That isn't each visit.
[01:24:42.302 --> 01:24:44.844]  That's IPs.
[01:24:44.844 --> 01:24:46.545]  You know what can happen with that kind of numbers?
[01:24:46.545 --> 01:24:47.666]  If we just double that number?
[01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:51.069]  If everybody tells folks about the radio show, about the websites, and we double it and double it again?
[01:24:52.745 --> 01:24:56.847]  And then that's just to my sites, our information, our stories, our videos, our materials.
[01:24:56.847 --> 01:25:02.470]  I've made films that have had over 50, 60 million documented viewings online for free.
[01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:04.531]  Just one film.
[01:25:04.531 --> 01:25:09.013]  Little clips of my simulcast, the weekday radio show where we do the video cam.
[01:25:09.013 --> 01:25:13.976]  I mean, routinely those videos, just little clips of the show, get hundreds of thousands of views a week.
[01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:17.538]  And there's hundreds and hundreds of clips a week, totaling tens of millions.
[01:25:17.538 --> 01:25:20.239]  It's insane, the responsibility I've got!
[01:25:20.814 --> 01:25:25.557]  But you have a responsibility, too!
[01:25:25.557 --> 01:25:28.919]  And I'll tell you one big reason I'm still alive.
[01:25:28.919 --> 01:25:32.702]  If the establishment were to kill Alex Jones, it would make me a martyr.
[01:25:32.702 --> 01:25:36.004]  And it... I use the mushroom analogy.
[01:25:36.004 --> 01:25:38.406]  You know, mushrooms have spores in them.
[01:25:38.406 --> 01:25:40.307]  And if you stomp on one, the spores are released.
[01:25:40.307 --> 01:25:43.149]  There's one called a snuff box in Texas.
[01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:45.390]  It's a little round, gray one, brown one on the ground.
[01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.872]  And you step on it, and it looks like old-fashioned snuff.
[01:25:47.872 --> 01:25:49.713]  This brown dust comes out.
[01:25:49.713 --> 01:25:50.514]  Millions of spores.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.722]  And if you do that in your yard, the next time it rains, you'll have thousands of them.
[01:25:55.722 --> 01:26:00.685]  Somebody stomps on me, it's like stomping on a mushroom, and all these spores just shoot out.
[01:26:00.685 --> 01:26:02.486]  Oh, I'm already shooting spores out.
[01:26:02.486 --> 01:26:03.886]  It's already viral.
[01:26:03.886 --> 01:26:10.110]  But it's like taking every spore in that mushroom and planting it lovingly in the dirt.
[01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:13.352]  Instead of just a few of my spores getting out, it would make me explode.
[01:26:13.352 --> 01:26:14.092]  But it's more than that.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:19.082]  You know, they say there's no atheist in Foxholes, folks, and I'm certainly no atheist.
[01:26:19.082 --> 01:26:21.343]  I believe in God, I love God, and I know I'm on a mission.
[01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:22.423]  I know we're all on a mission.
[01:26:22.423 --> 01:26:25.705]  We're all tested in this one life to live.
[01:26:25.705 --> 01:26:28.286]  The Devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[01:26:28.286 --> 01:26:31.187]  The New Order's greatest trick was convincing the world they didn't exist.
[01:26:31.187 --> 01:26:32.108]  Now they admit they exist.
[01:26:32.108 --> 01:26:32.368]  Why?
[01:26:32.368 --> 01:26:34.089]  They're making their move.
[01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:35.069]  They decloaked.
[01:26:35.069 --> 01:26:36.370]  It's a dangerous point for them.
[01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:37.310]  They had to do it.
[01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:38.591]  They turned off the cloaking device.
[01:26:41.406 --> 01:26:42.547]  I kept saying, look at that Shimmer.
[01:26:42.547 --> 01:26:43.107]  They're right there.
[01:26:43.107 --> 01:26:43.547]  They're right there.
[01:26:43.547 --> 01:26:44.247]  Here's their own document.
[01:26:44.247 --> 01:26:45.408]  See that Shimmer right there?
[01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:46.108]  That's an enemy.
[01:26:46.108 --> 01:27:00.293]  And then, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[01:27:10.165 --> 01:27:14.489]  And the pain has just begun.
[01:27:14.489 --> 01:27:17.772]  And so now is the time to warn people.
[01:27:17.772 --> 01:27:21.115]  Now is the time to reach out to people.
[01:27:21.115 --> 01:27:24.898]  You know, I told you that they were going to spend tens of trillions of dollars with the bailout because the bill said it.
[01:27:24.898 --> 01:27:27.541]  I'm no genius, I just took the time to read it.
[01:27:27.541 --> 01:27:31.444]  And I told you they'd use the money to buy up other banks and insurance companies and infrastructure.
[01:27:31.444 --> 01:27:31.985]  And they're doing it!
[01:27:33.871 --> 01:27:36.632]  And there's so many people out there that want to, quote, play it safe.
[01:27:36.632 --> 01:27:48.878]  So many other national talk show hosts, local talk show hosts in every area of the country, who I talk to privately at conventions and events, and, oh Alex, I know a lot of what you're saying is true, but I'm too scared to say it on air and, you know, I want to be mainline.
[01:27:48.878 --> 01:27:50.378]  I don't want to scare away any sponsors.
[01:27:50.378 --> 01:27:51.579]  There aren't going to be any sponsors.
[01:27:51.579 --> 01:27:53.380]  There aren't going to be as many radio shows.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:28:01.183]  There aren't going to be as good a country and a free market and all the cornucopia of good things that have come from having somewhat of a free society.
[01:28:01.183 --> 01:28:03.364]  Sometimes playing it safe isn't playing it safe.
[01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:09.798]  In fact, a lot of times in history, playing it safe is what gets your butt in a sling.
[01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:10.818]  The country's too important.
[01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:11.779]  The country's too good.
[01:28:11.779 --> 01:28:20.743]  Humanity's too good for us to stand down and suck our thumbs and not be involved, ladies and gentlemen, and rationalize and live in denial.
[01:28:20.743 --> 01:28:22.124]  I'll go back to it.
[01:28:22.124 --> 01:28:32.269]  Now all these national neocon fake conservative hosts that have been there to neutralize their audiences, to make them stand down, who said thousands of times there's no new world order, no global government,
[01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:38.890]  Now they're being forced to go on air and say, yeah, there's a new world order, yeah, there's a global government, but it's a liberal conspiracy!
[01:28:38.890 --> 01:28:43.833]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's a conservative and liberal conspiracy, because there is no conservative and liberal at the highest levels.
[01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:45.934]  They own both parties.
[01:28:45.934 --> 01:28:51.398]  And most people know that, but, I mean, are you really putting that into function, mentally, every time you hear a politician?
[01:28:51.398 --> 01:28:57.241]  Our Rahm Emanuel, during the news earlier, while I was at the staff, saying, the Republicans did this to the economy in the last eight years, and now they're going to have to pay for it.
[01:28:58.314 --> 01:29:06.523]  The Republicans were involved, but it was actually Clinton and Larry Summers and Geithner that set all this up in the 1990s.
[01:29:06.523 --> 01:29:11.328]  And it's just asinine, it's outrageous, and it's an insult to everybody's intelligence.
[01:29:11.328 --> 01:29:11.749]  Your call.
[01:29:11.749 --> 01:29:12.209]  Straight ahead.

[01:33:20.889 --> 01:33:22.870]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:25.913]  Alright, finishing up what I was saying.
[01:33:25.913 --> 01:33:27.314]  We're going to your calls.
[01:33:30.558 --> 01:33:34.179]  I'm still alive because I put out my message, my films, my information.
[01:33:34.179 --> 01:33:36.540]  If they kill me, it'll just make people pay that much more attention to it.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:40.521]  It'll underline, highlight everything I've said and written.
[01:33:40.521 --> 01:33:48.664]  But also, it's the good Lord above, and I believe in fate and destiny, and if you try and do the right thing and you've got a mission, if it's in God's plan, you're protected.
[01:33:48.664 --> 01:33:54.705]  But more than that, we have a lot of friends in government and in companies and corporations, the military, the police.
[01:33:54.705 --> 01:33:56.546]  They know this is true more than anybody else.
[01:33:58.902 --> 01:34:02.484]  Hey Alex, I have two friends that have very young children between the ages of 3 and 10, and I know about twice a year you
[01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:36.377]  A guest called in and asked, you know, how can, how do I best raise my children as we descend into this tyranny?
[01:34:36.377 --> 01:34:43.523]  And I wanted to be the first of the 2009 guests that calls and requests information from you.
[01:34:43.523 --> 01:34:48.988]  Unfortunately, neither of the children can be homeschooled.
[01:34:49.799 --> 01:34:59.642]  So, I was wondering, I'll be willing to listen off the air, but I was wondering if you could kind of address my two friends, and kind of instruct them how to raise their children.
[01:34:59.642 --> 01:35:03.143]  Do they have money to put them in a private school?
[01:35:03.143 --> 01:35:04.563]  I don't think so, unfortunately.
[01:35:04.563 --> 01:35:07.664]  Alright, let me try to answer your question.
[01:35:07.664 --> 01:35:15.826]  I've really studied this, and I've studied what experts that have had good, you know, good track records have said.
[01:35:15.826 --> 01:35:17.647]  They've had a lot of success.
[01:35:18.766 --> 01:35:25.431]  They need to move, then, to a government training camp school district, public school district, that is generally more affluent.
[01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:30.815]  They need to pick one that doesn't have the fences and the barbed wire and the thumb printing to get their school lunch.
[01:35:30.815 --> 01:35:38.180]  They also need to explain to their... Well, number one, keep your children off M&M's, sugar, caffeine, because they're going to act up if they're on that, no matter how good they are.
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:39.741]  And don't let your children watch TV.
[01:35:39.741 --> 01:35:40.601]  It brain damages them.
[01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:41.022]  Don't believe me?
[01:35:41.022 --> 01:35:44.144]  Just Google television viewing brain damage, especially in young.
[01:35:44.687 --> 01:35:46.168]  Don't let them watch the video games.
[01:35:46.168 --> 01:35:47.289]  Watch out who they hang out with.
[01:35:47.289 --> 01:35:48.370]  I mean, all the basic simple stuff.
[01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:52.114]  But the biggest thing is nutrition with children.
[01:35:52.114 --> 01:35:53.375]  No caffeine.
[01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:55.196]  No processed sugar.
[01:35:55.196 --> 01:36:03.424]  And explain to them that the system's dangerous and corrupt and that the system wants to get them, you know, most public schools are to induct children into prison.
[01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:09.129]  I kept telling people that Austin, Texas puts children in juvenile, private juvenile homes that make
[01:36:09.898 --> 01:36:23.327]  Tens of millions here in Austin alone off of federal and state money, and now it's come out in Iowa and Chicago, Illinois, all over the country, CNN headline, judges giving kickbacks to put innocent children in jail.
[01:36:23.327 --> 01:36:30.632]  And I mean, they would write something on their MySpace in the seventh grade that wasn't even violent or bad about their teacher, six months in a, quote, labor camp.
[01:36:30.632 --> 01:36:34.195]  And that judge had gotten one judge two million bucks to do that.
[01:36:34.195 --> 01:36:34.815]  They pled guilty.
[01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:38.358]  It goes on all over the place, folks.
[01:36:38.358 --> 01:36:40.578]  You also start investigations.
[01:36:40.578 --> 01:36:43.299]  When you see crimes like this being committed, blow the whistle.
[01:36:43.299 --> 01:36:44.459]  This is going on almost everywhere.
[01:36:44.459 --> 01:36:46.500]  It's totally illegal.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.701]  And the judges all need to go to prison.
[01:36:48.701 --> 01:36:50.281]  These are criminals!
[01:36:50.281 --> 01:36:51.922]  Period!
[01:36:51.922 --> 01:36:53.502]  Folks, everything I tell you is documented.
[01:36:53.502 --> 01:36:59.664]  I told you they were taking your kid's blood for 36 years and putting it in secret DNA databases for eugenics testing.
[01:36:59.664 --> 01:37:01.044]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:37:01.044 --> 01:37:02.144]  But they say 44 years.
[01:37:02.144 --> 01:37:03.165]  Well, the documents I had said 36.
[01:37:04.298 --> 01:37:05.820]  Hi Alex, I want to talk about Hillary Clinton
[01:37:26.014 --> 01:37:34.597]  The eminent domain issue that came up and then the idea of national repentance.
[01:37:34.597 --> 01:37:50.101]  Okay, number one, the guy that puts out the story about the Amaro coin, that's a real coin but it's put out by a private mint, is the same guy that put out the story that Hillary signed a deal with no footnote with the Chinese to give our land to the Chinese under eminent domain for them to keep buying U.S.
[01:37:50.101 --> 01:37:50.502]  debt.
[01:37:50.502 --> 01:37:54.623]  Now, the reason this is such bad, wicked propaganda is that it's true
[01:37:55.343 --> 01:37:59.247]  That that's been done, but not true the way he says.
[01:37:59.247 --> 01:38:08.196]  And so when people find out that isn't true, then when I talk about how they've done it to the foreign banks, people will think that I'm the one putting out the hoax.
[01:38:08.196 --> 01:38:11.559]  Yeah, there's a real problem with this information.
[01:38:11.559 --> 01:38:18.987]  We need you to air the problem of government corruption while being absolutely truthful with no exaggerations of the current available facts.
[01:38:19.878 --> 01:38:31.384]  For example, we can't say we know of thousands of daily episodes of something occurring such as epidemics of spongiform brain neuropathy resulting from aspartame use.
[01:38:31.384 --> 01:38:43.371]  We can report the actual findings, but when we average the scattered local results and extrapolate to a global level, it is an unreliable logic that results.
[01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:45.212]  Solzhenitsyn is known for
[01:38:45.742 --> 01:38:46.102]  I agree.
[01:38:46.102 --> 01:38:53.427]  We have to admit what's wrong with ourselves individually and get a strong mooring, a strong compass, and then go from there.
[01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:53.907]  Now, separately,
[01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:38.625]  On the subject, through the IMF, through the World Bank, the United States, the federal government, has pledged its natural resources, its lands, through different executive orders that we've covered in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, covers it, to the global holding banks, the International Bank of Settlements and others, and then China did come out in Reuters a few weeks ago and say, we want more pledged, that's why the
[01:39:39.375 --> 01:39:47.881]  That's why the Arabs are getting the ports and the roads and why Spanish government backed, you know, banks that back private companies are getting the roads and toll roads.
[01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:50.403]  So it is true that this is all happening.
[01:39:50.403 --> 01:39:57.588]  It's just that specifically on, you know, saying overall China gets it all, that's an exaggeration.
[01:39:57.588 --> 01:40:07.155]  Well, if I had a whistleblower constitutional lawyer to protect me and if that eminent domain story was correct,
[01:40:08.308 --> 01:40:10.269]  I'm in a federal government job.
[01:40:10.269 --> 01:40:27.818]  I would send an email to the complete government list, the global list, and convict whoever is involved in this because it is a treasonous thing.
[01:40:27.818 --> 01:40:28.598]  Sir, it is true.
[01:40:28.598 --> 01:40:32.980]  Why do you think the Chinese were given the Panama Canal when we built it and the U.S.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:34.621]  didn't even try to get bids on it and keep it?
[01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:36.962]  Well, there's something really fishy there.
[01:40:36.962 --> 01:40:45.946]  It seems like there's a long-standing global plan to... Well, the globalists say it's about destroying sovereignty.
[01:40:45.946 --> 01:40:50.489]  They transfer countries' powers to other nations they control.
[01:40:50.489 --> 01:40:51.569]  Right.
[01:40:51.569 --> 01:41:00.654]  Well, if sovereignty was Obama's plan, if he really wanted to swear an oath to the Constitution to protect and defend it,
[01:41:01.343 --> 01:41:12.150]  Notice that from the Bush administration to his administration, we never got a chance for repentance of all the supposed crimes of the Bush administration.
[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:13.171]  In fact, you're right.
[01:41:13.171 --> 01:41:19.556]  He called Bush when he decided to keep the troops in Iraq this weekend to get his advice before he made the announcement.
[01:41:19.556 --> 01:41:21.417]  That was in the news.
[01:41:21.417 --> 01:41:23.138]  And he's continuing everything Bush did.
[01:41:23.138 --> 01:41:27.041]  Headline, Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees.
[01:41:27.041 --> 01:41:28.141]  Reuters.
[01:41:28.141 --> 01:41:29.422]  It's all continuing.
[01:41:29.422 --> 01:41:30.443]  In fact, it's accelerating.
[01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:36.048]  The exact same course, just the entire left is now standing down.
[01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:37.470]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas.
[01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:38.091]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:41.488]  Yeah, good afternoon Alex.
[01:41:41.488 --> 01:41:52.316]  First of all, before I get to my subject, which is about eugenics, I just wanted to say, Josh, there was a guy I called in a little while ago asking basically what makes you tick and how he could be that way.
[01:41:52.316 --> 01:41:54.097]  I've got to tell you something, I've never met you.
[01:41:54.097 --> 01:41:56.959]  I've talked to you several times on the phone.
[01:41:56.959 --> 01:42:00.362]  I've had the chance to view and listen to and watch a lot of your materials.
[01:42:01.963 --> 01:42:11.086]  I remember about a year ago I had a friend of mine do an interview with you named Jap, the Bible School college student, and it's passion.
[01:42:11.086 --> 01:42:16.728]  It's a love for what is good and right and true, based in truth.
[01:42:17.308 --> 01:42:17.888]  I think so.
[01:42:33.853 --> 01:42:35.094]  I'm sorry, I'm just like you.
[01:42:35.094 --> 01:42:35.734]  It's L.A.
[01:42:35.734 --> 01:42:37.015]  so much to you.
[01:42:37.015 --> 01:42:42.217]  They're not gonna do what they plan to do as far as me and my family, you know.
[01:42:42.217 --> 01:42:48.560]  I'd rather die than allow them to enslave me like that and torture my family and all the wicked things that they do.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:51.162]  When you have that attitude, you're unstoppable.
[01:42:51.162 --> 01:43:00.326]  If the country got that attitude back instead of this fake, you know, NASCAR, party time, fake male masculinity, a real man defends his liberty, his freedom, his country.
[01:43:00.942 --> 01:43:02.245]  I'm not saying NASCAR is bad.
[01:43:02.245 --> 01:43:04.429]  I'm saying that isn't your manliness.
[01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:05.952]  Sir, good to hear from you.
[01:43:05.952 --> 01:43:07.895]  More calls straight ahead after this quick break.
[01:43:07.895 --> 01:43:10.861]  PrisonPlanet.com, TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:43:10.861 --> 01:43:12.764]  The new film comes out in 13 days.
[01:43:14.019 --> 01:43:17.242]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:43:17.242 --> 01:43:20.564]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:43:20.564 --> 01:43:24.348]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:43:24.348 --> 01:43:30.933]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:43:30.933 --> 01:43:36.157]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.

[01:45:14.276 --> 01:45:15.177]  You worry.

[01:45:17.239 --> 01:45:19.882]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:45:19.882 --> 01:45:22.024]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:45:22.024 --> 01:45:23.626]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:45:23.626 --> 01:45:27.230]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:32.455]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:45:32.455 --> 01:45:35.759]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:45:36.411 --> 01:45:38.091]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:45:38.091 --> 01:45:41.012]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:45:41.012 --> 01:45:44.453]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.

[01:46:13.644 --> 01:46:19.087]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:46:19.087 --> 01:46:28.291]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:46:28.291 --> 01:46:31.692]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:46:31.872 --> 01:46:35.875]  Did you know that many herbal remedies contain unwanted additives and fillers?

[01:47:27.782 --> 01:47:39.751]  One thing, I've been getting a lot of calls about people all over the country, including family, right here in Austin to go to work at, you know, 4.35, 6 in the morning.
[01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:45.015]  And I was talking to Paul Hartman, whose dad works for a, what, TV station down there?
[01:47:45.015 --> 01:47:49.478]  And he goes to work at 3.30 in the morning, gets pulled over all the time, and it's just, where are you going, what are you doing?
[01:47:49.478 --> 01:47:57.204]  See, sounds good to stop crime, but meanwhile they won't let the illegal aliens to jail, they're above the law, but it's part of living in a police state.
[01:47:57.938 --> 01:48:11.384]  And one of the guys here that works on one of the morning shows was talking about over here in the story about one of the talk show hosts, who's a nice guy, saying, man, yeah, I live in Cedar Park, and I drive to work, and they just pull me over for not even speeding and just want to know what I'm doing out.
[01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:13.445]  Well, a lot of us work at night.
[01:48:13.445 --> 01:48:19.007]  And I drive home a lot of times at 1, 2 in the morning, and there's just police pulling people over everywhere, and I watch it.
[01:48:19.007 --> 01:48:23.770]  But who's you want to tell that story on air, or want to take some calls?
[01:48:23.770 --> 01:48:25.931]  Because he's over there putting more calls on the line.
[01:48:25.931 --> 01:48:26.871]  You want to tell the story briefly?
[01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.910]  About what happened?
[01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:31.010]  That's what I was telling you during the break.
[01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:33.771]  You'll have to get over by one of the microphones there to do that.
[01:48:33.771 --> 01:48:38.973]  Just real briefly because I want to talk to a bunch of callers here and give them each at least a minute or so at the end of the show.
[01:48:38.973 --> 01:48:41.534]  Yeah, tell folks what happened to your dad.
[01:48:41.534 --> 01:48:52.238]  I was telling you when I got that seatbelt ticket or whatever, he was just going off and he was telling me that he gets pulled over at least once or a couple times a month going into work.
[01:48:53.049 --> 01:48:56.571]  Cause you know he works the morning show and he has to be there like at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:48:56.571 --> 01:48:59.193]  And finally once they caught him without a seatbelt?
[01:48:59.193 --> 01:49:03.776]  Well when he was with us, well his seatbelt was on but it was just on.
[01:49:03.776 --> 01:49:08.799]  So see it's micro-enforcement, but literally the illegal aliens are above the law and they'll take him to jail for no driver's license.
[01:49:08.799 --> 01:49:17.445]  Well even my man that I work, you know at my KI job, the dude, my right hand man, my master control operator, he used to get pulled over like every other week.
[01:49:17.445 --> 01:49:18.066]  He'd come in there late.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:22.021]  It's like, man, I got pulled over in Round Rock again or whatever.
[01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:23.081]  Yeah, that's not freedom.
[01:49:23.081 --> 01:49:26.082]  That's not what America is supposed to be about.
[01:49:26.082 --> 01:49:28.523]  But, I mean, I'm really tired of it.
[01:49:28.523 --> 01:49:29.243]  I'm really tired of it.
[01:49:29.243 --> 01:49:29.963]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:33.765]  I appreciate your call there in studio with us.
[01:49:33.765 --> 01:49:35.145]  Oh, man, I am tired.
[01:49:35.145 --> 01:49:39.647]  I'm finally almost done with making the Obama deception that goes off tomorrow to be mass-produced.
[01:49:39.647 --> 01:49:42.848]  I hope you pre-order it, folks, at InfoWars.com so you get it first.
[01:49:42.848 --> 01:49:43.928]  It's going to ship out March 15th.
[01:49:45.802 --> 01:49:47.603]  Got to expose this guy and his agenda.
[01:49:47.603 --> 01:49:50.024]  Mike in Maryland, you're on the air.
[01:49:50.024 --> 01:49:51.445]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:49:51.445 --> 01:49:53.266]  I appreciate everything you do.
[01:49:53.266 --> 01:49:59.089]  Every day I try to tell someone about Nipple Wars or any of the alternative media that exposes the New World Order.
[01:49:59.089 --> 01:50:05.633]  I saw you at the Bilderberg Conference last summer, and that was really a hoot, you know, to at least vent our frustrations.
[01:50:05.633 --> 01:50:08.595]  The Bilderberg Group Conference that doesn't exist, yeah.
[01:50:08.595 --> 01:50:09.935]  Yeah, I know.
[01:50:09.935 --> 01:50:13.297]  If I may be so bold to have a request, and then I have a question.
[01:50:13.297 --> 01:50:14.098]  My request is,
[01:50:15.863 --> 01:50:27.949]  Monitor, you know, the corporate media and the regular media, and I watch Fox Business News, and I know people raise their eyebrows, but it does present some good information sometimes, and it is entertaining.
[01:50:27.949 --> 01:50:41.817]  But they have this host on there, Cody Willard, who talks about the Illuminati on numerous occasions, and he seems to be at Loggerheads with the other host on the show, and he is against the bills.
[01:50:41.817 --> 01:50:42.657]  This is just for a question.
[01:50:42.657 --> 01:50:44.018]  It might make a good guest, I don't know.
[01:50:44.747 --> 01:50:50.049]  But my question is, what do you make of Glenn Beck?
[01:50:50.049 --> 01:51:00.614]  He seems like he's trying to create a parallel paradigm of the alternative media, but he's kind of like, you know, very guarded in the information.
[01:51:00.614 --> 01:51:01.894]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:51:01.894 --> 01:51:13.739]  The establishment knows that this information is the most popular truthful information out there, and so Beck, you know, one hour will say Iran's got nuclear weapons, just like Iraq supposedly had them.
[01:51:15.051 --> 01:51:18.774]  And then next he'll talk about the New World Order and how dangerous it is, and global banks taking over.
[01:51:18.774 --> 01:51:23.979]  So he'll admit it's going on, but never identify the full picture, and then just kind of tell you about part of the story.
[01:51:23.979 --> 01:51:27.662]  Kind of Rush Limbaugh 2.0, where Limbaugh just says none of it exists.
[01:51:27.662 --> 01:51:29.924]  Beck will admit it exists, but then say that the U.S.
[01:51:29.924 --> 01:51:31.905]  government's fighting the New World Order.
[01:51:31.905 --> 01:51:34.828]  And then just constantly say, we've got to attack Iran, we've got to attack this.
[01:51:34.828 --> 01:51:41.213]  I remember him saying that Ron Paul supporters need to have the, quote, army used against them a year ago, and that we were dangerous.
[01:51:41.213 --> 01:51:42.935]  But now he claims he's Ron Paul's best friend.
[01:51:43.658 --> 01:51:48.281]  So, it's just a testament that this information is becoming completely mainstream.
[01:51:48.281 --> 01:51:50.002]  Phil in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:51:50.002 --> 01:51:51.023]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:51:51.023 --> 01:51:51.704]  Hi, Phil.
[01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:52.964]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:51:52.964 --> 01:51:58.168]  I have so many fun things I'd love to discuss with you, but I think I'm going to concentrate on just one.
[01:51:58.168 --> 01:52:07.835]  To help people understand a little better why so many bad and unpleasant things happen in our world and are so readily accepted by so much of the population.
[01:52:07.835 --> 01:52:09.536]  Because we've been eased into it incrementally.
[01:52:10.089 --> 01:52:15.433]  There is that, but are you familiar with the works of an individual named Jean Piaget?
[01:52:15.433 --> 01:52:16.514]  It does ring a bell.
[01:52:16.514 --> 01:52:20.617]  Jean Piaget was, I believe, Swiss or some foreign rascal or another.
[01:52:20.617 --> 01:52:24.921]  He was a developmental psychologist that did a significant amount of research with young children.
[01:52:24.921 --> 01:52:33.347]  Jean Piaget developed what he called a series of cognitive developments, which are now taught in psychology, or they were when I took psychology twenty-odd years ago.
[01:52:33.347 --> 01:52:36.410]  There is a fourth and final state of cognitive development.
[01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:37.731]  He basically broke down the
[01:52:39.150 --> 01:52:42.472]  Yeah, well that goes into the hierarchy of needs as well.
[01:52:42.472 --> 01:52:47.374]  Once you really are a fulfilled person, you start caring about others, you want to be informed, you want the truth.
[01:52:47.374 --> 01:52:48.394]  But most people are in like a
[01:53:03.763 --> 01:53:06.124]  Adolescent level of just acting cool.
[01:53:06.124 --> 01:53:07.165]  I call it play acting.
[01:53:07.165 --> 01:53:15.989]  They like play the part and they love playing along with with delusional roles and they never fully mature.
[01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:25.993]  I generally find it easiest to explain to people as the development of abstract thought which is also part of the definition of it and I use the analogy of breaking the rules.
[01:53:25.993 --> 01:53:27.354]  Many people are taught rules
[01:53:28.211 --> 01:53:30.152]  And the rules are the only thing that matter to them.
[01:53:30.152 --> 01:53:34.693]  But it's okay for the government to break the rules, it's just the people can't.
[01:53:34.693 --> 01:53:36.954]  And they make more and more unconstitutional rules.
[01:53:36.954 --> 01:53:44.317]  In a tyranny, in a corrupt system, they make the general public criminals so they have an excuse to get involved in your life.
[01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:54.880]  That's what all this police state's about, is training you to be pulled over, to be checked, to be frisked, to go through airports, to take your shoes off, to go through body scanners, training you to answer the questions of the secret police.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.921]  And now in Canada, many areas of the U.S.
[01:53:56.921 --> 01:53:57.321]  and England,
[01:53:57.702 --> 01:54:02.224]  Secret Police has come up, it happened to me in England, started asking me questions, started trying to search you.
[01:54:02.224 --> 01:54:04.624]  Again, it's just a police state.
[01:54:04.624 --> 01:54:07.125]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:54:07.125 --> 01:54:09.246]  Yeah, I got a two-part question.
[01:54:09.246 --> 01:54:12.047]  First of all, who's running the show?
[01:54:12.047 --> 01:54:13.868]  Who's doing this New World Order?
[01:54:13.868 --> 01:54:20.430]  And second of all, as a 23-year-old college student, what am I supposed to do other than just spread the word and tell people?
[01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:22.931]  I mean, how do I become active, I guess?
[01:54:23.504 --> 01:54:25.745]  Alright, number one, who owns the New World Order?
[01:54:25.745 --> 01:54:29.946]  Every major nation has a group of families or kingpins that control their country.
[01:54:29.946 --> 01:54:36.809]  Then those kingpins make deals with the Anglo-American banking system based in the US, England, and Europe.
[01:54:36.809 --> 01:54:43.551]  And if those countries don't make deals, the globalists invade them or fund rebels inside their country or fund their neighbor to attack them.
[01:54:43.551 --> 01:54:47.633]  And it is the robber barons, it is the royalty, it is the elite banking families of the planet
[01:54:48.431 --> 01:54:49.372]  It is the New World Order.
[01:54:49.372 --> 01:54:57.716]  Go read the member list of the Bilderberg Group and you will see the 125 people who in their own writings brag that they run the world.
[01:54:57.716 --> 01:54:58.476]  What can you do?
[01:54:58.476 --> 01:55:07.881]  Sir, 30 states have introduced or are passing resolutions to declare sovereignty to say no to Second Amendment violations, no to FEMA camps, no to wars, no to the police state.
[01:55:07.881 --> 01:55:13.364]  We need to take the states over, remove the electronic fraudulent machines through lawsuits and recalls,
[01:55:13.888 --> 01:55:16.209]  We need to get our integrity and voting back.
[01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:17.910]  We need to take control of our county governments.
[01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:19.351]  Go speak to the city council.
[01:55:19.351 --> 01:55:20.051]  Get informed.
[01:55:20.051 --> 01:55:21.952]  But first, you have to get informed.
[01:55:21.952 --> 01:55:25.673]  First, and many people are informed, they're scared to act.
[01:55:25.673 --> 01:55:27.314]  Again, they're playing it safe.
[01:55:27.314 --> 01:55:30.356]  Playing it safe in a tyranny is not playing it safe.
[01:55:30.356 --> 01:55:33.137]  It ensures the tyranny wins and perfects the corruption.
[01:55:34.502 --> 01:55:46.852]  So the biggest thing is, like Howard Beale says in Network, first you've got to get mad, then you've got to get informed, then you've got to realize you're not going to save the world by yourself, but you've got to start a newsletter, start a website, start a radio show, call in to talk radio.
[01:55:46.852 --> 01:55:49.995]  Be active every day, reaching out to others.
[01:55:49.995 --> 01:55:54.379]  Talking to folks at church and at work and at the checkout line at the grocery store or mall.
[01:55:55.865 --> 01:55:57.667]  Getting self-sufficient.
[01:55:57.667 --> 01:55:58.728]  Defending the Second Amendment.
[01:55:58.728 --> 01:56:00.250]  Defending the Tenth Amendment.
[01:56:00.250 --> 01:56:03.833]  Just what the founders did in the decade that led up to the war.
[01:56:03.833 --> 01:56:05.215]  They had committees of correspondence.
[01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:08.038]  They had committees of public safety.
[01:56:08.038 --> 01:56:12.943]  They had the information they circulated to educate the public.
[01:56:12.943 --> 01:56:14.284]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:56:14.284 --> 01:56:14.985]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:56:15.894 --> 01:56:17.894]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:56:17.894 --> 01:56:24.556]  We had a news report here Friday at a private school that they said they're going to have no school because of the security situation.
[01:56:24.556 --> 01:56:26.637]  And all weekend, they did not disclose.
[01:56:26.637 --> 01:56:28.097]  And they did not disclose.
[01:56:28.097 --> 01:56:41.120]  And I got in the car, went down by there, and something was up because they had so much police, they had SWAT teams around the school, something is urban- Yeah, they're doing federal drills at the school
[01:56:41.704 --> 01:56:44.207]  To take it over in the name of stopping mass shootings.
[01:56:44.207 --> 01:56:48.131]  But in many cases, they load the kids on FEMA trucks and take them to other facilities.
[01:56:48.131 --> 01:56:52.255]  But parents got so mad that they now do it normally when kids aren't there.
[01:56:52.255 --> 01:56:54.297]  Yeah, but I believe that's what they were doing.
[01:56:54.297 --> 01:56:57.160]  And, you know, you're talking about the secret police.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.464]  They have luxury cars and out-of-state police pulling people over around here now.
[01:57:01.464 --> 01:57:03.426]  You must be with Al Qaeda if you don't do this or that.
[01:57:03.426 --> 01:57:03.867]  You must be...
[01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:05.418]  Not right.
[01:57:05.418 --> 01:57:09.503]  Either your free speeches, Al-Qaeda, or Infowars.com, whatever.
[01:57:09.503 --> 01:57:16.972]  I mean, they're getting, really, like you said, they have all... I saw two who got stopped with two unmarked cars.
[01:57:16.972 --> 01:57:20.016]  One was a pickup truck, one was the other, and I got their license plate.
[01:57:20.016 --> 01:57:22.639]  Out-of-state plate, had a Tennessee plate, one had an Indiana plate.
[01:57:23.416 --> 01:57:24.937]  How secret are they getting out here?
[01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.397]  Yeah, there's no more jurisdiction.
[01:57:26.397 --> 01:57:28.518]  There's no more state sovereignty.
[01:57:28.518 --> 01:57:31.619]  Look, private banks took over the government.
[01:57:31.619 --> 01:57:34.900]  They're using the government to loot and steal and rob from the people.
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:37.801]  That money is taken and paid to the national debt.
[01:57:37.801 --> 01:57:40.262]  They're putting in satellite tracker boxes in all the cars.
[01:57:40.262 --> 01:57:41.222]  It's openly being announced.
[01:57:41.742 --> 01:57:43.263]  Face scanning cameras everywhere.
[01:57:43.263 --> 01:57:45.183]  Total control grid.
[01:57:45.183 --> 01:57:45.964]  I'm out of time.
[01:57:45.964 --> 01:57:48.304]  I'm sorry to Perry and Josh and others that are holding.
[01:57:48.304 --> 01:57:50.965]  I'll be back next Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:50.965 --> 01:57:52.526]  and back during the weekday show as well.
[01:57:52.526 --> 01:57:53.966]  We'll see you at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:53.966 --> 01:57:55.587]  Don't forget, the Obama Deception.
[01:57:55.587 --> 01:57:56.907]  You can pre-order it now.
[01:57:56.907 --> 01:57:58.468]  My ultimate film.
[01:57:58.468 --> 01:57:59.268]  God bless you all.
[01:57:59.268 --> 01:58:00.469]  We got a good chance of winning this.
[01:58:00.469 --> 01:58:01.249]  Good job with the crew.
[01:58:01.249 --> 01:58:01.609]  Take care.
[01:58:04.133 --> 01:58:08.474]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:58:33.738 --> 01:58:43.064]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:58:43.064 --> 01:58:43.865]  This capitalism?
[01:58:43.865 --> 01:58:50.149]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.930]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:54.092]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:58:54.092 --> 01:58:55.012]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:58:55.012 --> 01:58:56.413]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:58:56.413 --> 01:58:56.753]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:58:56.753 --> 01:58:57.014]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:59:04.178 --> 01:59:11.560]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest priced, highest quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:15.821]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds 4 to 5 people is only $39.95.
[01:59:15.821 --> 01:59:21.183]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds 4 to 5 people for under $4,000.
[01:59:21.183 --> 01:59:24.684]  That's only 92 cents per person for each meal.
[01:59:24.684 --> 01:59:25.225]  I don't know.
[01:59:36.391 --> 01:59:36.551]  Thanks!
