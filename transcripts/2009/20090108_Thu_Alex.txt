[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.430]  Brother.
[00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:02.132]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:03.975]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:05.437]  You want answers?
[00:00:06.198 --> 00:00:07.099]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:11.466]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:16.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:23.354]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:23.774]  Welcome.
[00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:42.543]  We're going to be live for the next two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting this Thursday, January 8, 2009 edition, this attempt to awaken the world population to the overarching world psychological dictatorship that's run by the New World Order.
[00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:53.286]  For the next hour and a half, we're honored to be joined by one of the most sought-after speakers on radio and in person, filmmaker, best-selling author, David Icke.
[00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:55.587]  Also championship goalie in his own right.
[00:00:56.067 --> 00:01:03.709]  Of course, BBC News presenter before his startling Saul on the road to Damascus transformation.
[00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:07.557]  Literally being knocked off his horse with a revelation.
[00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:22.989]  And in the last 15, 16, 17 years he has spoken to millions of people around the world, and we're honored to have him again for the next hour and a half to talk about the current world economic crisis being engineered, and how this is really going to force an even faster awakening to this tyranny.
[00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:27.633]  So, David Icke, it is great to have you joining us here from England.
[00:01:28.273 --> 00:01:28.773]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:34.378]  This is a short segment, but what are some of the things you want to discuss and go over today?
[00:01:35.782 --> 00:02:04.533]  Well certainly we talk about the financial situation because you know for me what we're looking at is a similar situation to when they have a controlled demolition of a building and the charges go off and you see the flashes and then extraordinarily there's that split second when nothing seems to happen and then the whole thing crashes and for me where we are in this economic engineered collapse is in that split second before the whole thing starts to collapse and you know when you think
[00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:05.511]  That's great.
[00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:28.491]  You're right.
[00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:57.782]  In the time we have left in this first segment, I want to get your response, since last time we had you on, to...
[00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:02.019]  It's got to be more than 400 articles I've seen.
[00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:13.383]  If you Google the term New World Order and put it into the news section, not web, but news, the last time I checked it was 4,600 news articles, but I only, over the last few months, have read, I know it's more than 300.
[00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.444]  It's 10 or 15 a day I'd see without looking.
[00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:27.429]  Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal, Der Spiegel, all the major publications of record of the establishment, the Bilderberg run, their editor-in-chief, of course, is Bilderberg, Mr. Wolf.
[00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.010]  All right, let's go to that.
[00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:56.545]  No, there was always a time when what they were doing covertly had to break the surface because they want to change society in the image that they want to change society.
[00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:59.947]  So we have to eventually see it in our face and that's what we're seeing.
[00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:03.028]  And of course, you know, those of us like you and me and many others who've been
[00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.850]  I think?
[00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:37.378]  The infrastructure we've been predicting all this time, including the World Central Bank.
[00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:40.021]  They've not used that word yet, that term yet, but they will.
[00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:42.804]  They're talking about... Actually, they have, David.
[00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.207]  Actually, they have mentioned a new World Central Bank.
[00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:46.008]  You may have missed it.
[00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:46.769]  Stay there.
[00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.653]  David Icke, we'll be back after this quick break to go over all of this.
[00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:51.975]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:55.373 --> 00:05:01.015]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:06.357]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:11.719]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:15.581]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.582]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:05:17.922 --> 00:05:20.643]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.904]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:27.665]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:32.467]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:33.528]  Do your part.
[00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:36.069]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:57.433]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:06:57.593 --> 00:07:02.837]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:08.481]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:09.962]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:19.209]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:21.250]  Now, compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:25.634]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:04.978]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:17.508]  We are live, blasting out on the AM and FM dial, simulcasting on global shortwave, the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, and streaming live at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:08:17.548 --> 00:08:22.852]  Don't forget the free podcast you can go sign up for, for free at infowars.com on the listen page.
[00:08:23.453 --> 00:08:24.574]  Okay, David Icke,
[00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:33.901]  Continuing, for more than 15 years you've talked about how the private financial banks would engineer a crisis and then out of that bring in their world government.
[00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:45.311]  They have said, as we were getting to before we went to break, at the G20 Summit, a new world financial system with a world financial bank where you will pay your carbon credits directly to them.
[00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:48.792]  I remember seeing that in the Financial Times of London and other places.
[00:08:48.832 --> 00:08:50.913]  They are now moving us towards that.
[00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:55.294]  So, it looks like their system is imploding and that, you know, they're laying off all these financial workers.
[00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:58.415]  That's because they don't need the little bees to gather people's investments.
[00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:00.356]  They're now stealing the pension funds.
[00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:09.159]  We're now, the West is in negative savings, so they need to destroy the old system to build their new system, problem, reaction, solution.
[00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:10.940]  Break that down for us, David Icke.
[00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:26.577]  Yeah, they're talking in Europe, people like Sarkozy and Gordon Brown about a new global financial architecture which is all course all well speak for this centralized financial system that will dictate the whole of global finance from a central point.
[00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.861]  This is what they've been working towards and it's important to stress that
[00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:36.484]  You know, when people see the banking system collapsing, they think it's bad for the bankers.
[00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:39.646]  Well, it's bad for the bankers who lose their jobs, like you say, the bees.
[00:09:40.006 --> 00:09:42.047]  But it's not bad for the people who own the system.
[00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:43.228]  And this is the point.
[00:09:43.888 --> 00:09:46.650]  The families that we're talking about own the system.
[00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:56.515]  So if they owned the National Football League, they couldn't care less if one team beats this team or that team beats another team, because they own the game.
[00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:57.376]  They can't lose.
[00:09:57.776 --> 00:10:01.438]  So when this bank goes down or that bank goes down or this bank's absorbed by this bank,
[00:10:02.145 --> 00:10:03.246]  It doesn't matter to them.
[00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:06.589]  What it means is there's fewer names on the doors to deal with.
[00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:19.899]  They own the game and they're changing the game now to increase the amount of centralized global control that will, by definition, increase dramatically the amount of control over
[00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:20.878]  I don't know.
[00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:57.749]  We've gone so far along this road while people have been watching game shows and watching the soaps and the football and now it's peaked its head into the public arena where it's in our face and people are going where did this come from?
[00:10:58.109 --> 00:11:09.834]  Well it's come from decades and decades indeed hundreds of years of manipulation to get us to this point and it's a point of great challenge and great danger in terms of freedom but it's also a point
[00:11:10.314 --> 00:11:10.414]  Yes.
[00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:35.252]  More and more people who were ignoring it before are now going, hold on a second, what can we do about this?
[00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:49.385]  So we're moving into a stage where we can actually, those that are challenging this tyranny, this global fascism, where we can actually go to a stage of starting to do something about it rather than just talk about it.
[00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:56.330]  Okay, David, while you were talking, I went into Google and Googled World Central Bank and found hundreds of articles.
[00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:03.355]  Here is Newsweek, why we need a Bank of the World, the financial crisis is global and only International Central Bank can deal with it.
[00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:11.522]  Now, already under the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, in their own documents, they admit they already are the World Central Bank, but under this, they will set interest rates globally.
[00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:14.284]  They will selectively control nations.
[00:12:14.324 --> 00:12:16.425]  They will decide how much currency can be issued.
[00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:19.287]  You'll still have your currencies of the world, in their own words.
[00:12:19.848 --> 00:12:22.089]  It will just all be regulated and controlled by them.
[00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:24.131]  Kind of like the national ID card in the U.S.
[00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:29.375]  It's the states administering it, but the feds set it up and control the computer systems.
[00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:36.500]  So it's really a national ID card tied into a world ID database, but the public thinks it's a driver's license when it's really the real ID.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.641]  But there is Newsweek
[00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:51.910]  For anyone that doubts this, and I could sit here showing people hundreds of these where they are saying not just that they're setting up a World Central Bank, but that you will pay your taxes on every activity you are involved in on your carbon footprint to them.
[00:12:53.123 --> 00:13:13.455]  Yeah, and the idea is to eventually get rid of all currencies for a simple reason, that at the moment if you go into a store or you want to buy something anywhere and you give them electronic money and the computer says no to your credit card, then at least still, just, just, you have the opportunity to say, well I'll pay cash then.
[00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:14.615]  And that's starting.
[00:13:30.362 --> 00:13:31.643]  And that's already happening.
[00:13:32.924 --> 00:13:39.711]  We never shop at Walmart here at this office, but I said, hurry up and get me a TiVo so I can record things off TV here at the new office.
[00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:42.233]  And the guys went to Walmart without asking me.
[00:13:42.273 --> 00:13:43.274]  I don't micromanage them.
[00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:50.601]  And my guy called, and because he had a debt, not an unpaid check, but because he had a debt,
[00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:52.041]  That he hadn't paid.
[00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:54.842]  Now the credit scores tied in with Wal-Mart and other big stores.
[00:13:55.222 --> 00:14:00.023]  They wouldn't let him use that company check because he had bad credit.
[00:14:00.043 --> 00:14:20.649]  So we're already going into that system where, I mean, I see him carding 75-year-old men buying cigarettes or beer at the store now, and the corporations admit they're getting us ready to have to show ID to buy and sell, and they're going to have a new world and local sales tax that will also have a database of everything you buy, sell, and do in the name of administering the sales tax.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.341]  Yeah, and this is happening everywhere.
[00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:28.863]  I mean, in Britain, the Big Brother state is hurtling forward.
[00:14:29.124 --> 00:14:37.908]  And in terms of the economic situation here, I mean, it's not really reached the point that it's going to reach as we were talking about earlier.
[00:14:37.948 --> 00:14:50.514]  But when I go around the shops, which I occasionally do, not very often, or you go into a pub or a restaurant or something, places are empty where I go, where they never were before.
[00:14:51.084 --> 00:15:01.452]  And so, you know, we're on the brink of a massive economic situation here globally, and it's been deliberately engineered for the ends that we're talking about.
[00:15:03.674 --> 00:15:07.697]  David, how do we get the word out to the people?
[00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:11.880]  And as you said, our credibility is sore because everything we predicted is now unfolding, unfortunately.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.641]  I wish we were wrong.
[00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:19.666]  How do, what are the most, because you're very effective at unlocking minds, in your educated opinion, your informed opinion,
[00:15:20.647 --> 00:15:21.347]  From experience.
[00:15:21.908 --> 00:15:24.629]  How do we reach out to them and say, look, it's now here.
[00:15:24.689 --> 00:15:32.573]  We're not warning you about something coming and all the preparatory phase that was bad enough setting up this tyrannical, dehumanizing, soul-stealing grid.
[00:15:32.893 --> 00:15:41.958]  We're now entering in to the long slide into the depths of global mass extermination, population reduction, because we're not making even predictions.
[00:15:41.998 --> 00:15:43.359]  We're following their own documents.
[00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:44.799]  We know where it goes.
[00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:50.042]  Can the public face the horror of what's going to happen if they keep living in la-la land?
[00:15:51.263 --> 00:15:59.010]  Well, what I say to people is, you know, if you think you don't like the situation now, then think what you're going to face a little way down the road.
[00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.293]  And more than anything, think of what your children are going to have to face.
[00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:04.915]  Because you think we live in a controlled society now.
[00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:07.678]  This is nothing compared with what they are going to have to live in.
[00:16:08.198 --> 00:16:13.623]  So in terms of parents who are listening to this information, I would say this.
[00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:16.546]  Go and look your children in the eyes and tell them
[00:16:17.014 --> 00:16:19.977]  That you can't be bothered, or you're too frightened to do anything about it.
[00:16:20.277 --> 00:16:21.738]  You're too frightened to get involved.
[00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:30.826]  Too frightened to get involved in being another conduit for getting this information further and further expanded into the public mind.
[00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:36.751]  That you're too frightened to get together with others to stop cooperating with this system.
[00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:44.738]  And to not be intimidated into coming into line, which is a bit like coming into line in a concentration camp,
[00:16:45.331 --> 00:16:45.792]  I don't
[00:17:03.002 --> 00:17:04.864]  Let us see where the real power is here.
[00:17:05.104 --> 00:17:11.768]  There are billions of people, six billion, nearly getting on for seven billion on this planet, who are being manipulated.
[00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:21.075]  There are, in full knowledge of what they're doing, a relative handful of those who are doing the manipulating to the end that we're talking about.
[00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:30.121]  Because of the compartmentalized pyramids that they've constructed within all these institutions of government and finance and corporations,
[00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:46.772]  The vast majority of people who are daily making contributions to push the world towards this Orwellian global state have no idea that they're doing that because they don't know how their contributions fit in with everyone else's, only the few at the top do.
[00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:52.138]  And what we need to start doing is realizing that we've reached the fork in the road.
[00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:52.931]  I don't know.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.141]  I don't think so.
[00:18:39.858 --> 00:18:40.478]  Well, absolutely.
[00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:43.479]  We're going to get a break and come back and get more into this mass awakening.
[00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:46.199]  And I want to get your take on this after the break, David.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:19:01.303]  People love to say, oh, look at those stupid Jews, or those stupid gypsies, or those stupid Anglicans who didn't like Hitler, and they just went on trains, and they went to camps, and they stripped down naked, and they got run into pits and gunned down.
[00:19:01.363 --> 00:19:02.403]  Why didn't they fight back?
[00:19:02.423 --> 00:19:05.284]  And we see those Nazi film footage of that.
[00:19:06.064 --> 00:19:10.547]  When that was done incrementally, we're going to come back and get your analysis on this, that was done incrementally.
[00:19:10.587 --> 00:19:17.951]  They were slowly trained to live in ghettos and then to wear yellow stars or pink triangles or whatever the case was.
[00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:29.338]  They were slowly trained by incremental steps to put up with more and more until, well now we're taking you here to a camp to be safe because the public's beating you up and smashing your store windows.
[00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:33.780]  And, you know, now just take your clothes off over here.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.761]  We're going to take care of you.
[00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:40.964]  And then they would line up and see the people being shot in front of them, but they would still just run into the pit obediently to their deaths.
[00:19:41.644 --> 00:19:42.785]  That is mind control.
[00:19:42.825 --> 00:19:44.206]  That is incremental conditioning.
[00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:48.208]  And we're going into the same thing as the ambient tyranny is turned up.
[00:19:48.348 --> 00:19:52.330]  We have to learn to recognize that, to stop it now, and break our conditioning.
[00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.511]  Stay with us with David Icke.
[00:19:56.275 --> 00:20:07.994]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.076]  I think so.
[00:20:40.525 --> 00:20:44.828]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:44.848 --> 00:20:46.349]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[00:21:04.594 --> 00:21:05.614]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:06.135 --> 00:21:06.635]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:06.935 --> 00:21:07.936]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:07.956 --> 00:21:09.276]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:09.296 --> 00:21:10.937]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:11.297 --> 00:21:18.040]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:18.880]  Some U.S.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:24.583]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:28.785]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:31.807]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:55.717 --> 00:21:57.678]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:57.938 --> 00:22:00.579]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:09.182]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:22:09.482 --> 00:22:12.303]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:22:13.143 --> 00:22:16.364]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:19.265]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:20.586]  Take action now!
[00:22:20.726 --> 00:22:24.369]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:29.294]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:22:29.534 --> 00:22:32.737]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:22:32.857 --> 00:22:39.283]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:45.105]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:22:45.545 --> 00:22:47.626]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:53.088]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:02.172]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:23:02.632 --> 00:23:04.373]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:23:04.913 --> 00:23:06.393]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:23:07.034 --> 00:23:08.114]  Everyone needs something
[00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:19.343]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds
[00:23:25.296 --> 00:23:27.418]  Great way to surprise a potential attacker.

[00:23:43.612 --> 00:23:43.672]  1-800-313-6400.
[00:23:43.692 --> 00:23:44.052]  That's 1-800-313-6400.
[00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:20.520]  If you don't think the global architects running the western world and the planet won't kill you, won't enslave you, won't rob your pension funds blind, it's happening.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:29.242]  Just yesterday I saw several mainstream news articles admitting that British SAS trained Pol Pot's people to kill between three and four million.
[00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:32.569]  Why did they do this?
[00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:33.890]  We'll talk more about that with David Icke.
[00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:42.553]  David, I went into the mass mind control of people in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, over and over again, who will just march in and be mowed down and killed.
[00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:46.394]  Why did the founders of this country, why would they not go along with that?
[00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:47.274]  Why did they fight back?
[00:24:47.574 --> 00:24:48.335]  What's the difference?
[00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:57.478]  How do we get people to psychologically realize how they're being trained to have this learned helplessness, where they just lay down to the men in black uniforms?
[00:24:59.058 --> 00:25:00.699]  Well, when you're talking about mass mind control,
[00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:05.714]  We can't go any further than Barack Obama, because America has just had...
[00:25:07.043 --> 00:25:20.052]  visited upon it, a massive mass mind control operation to get him to power and to build his ludicrous, ludicrous myth of a personality and an image that so many people have bought.
[00:25:20.092 --> 00:25:34.382]  And I don't know about you, Alex, but I tell you, I've shaken my head a few times in the last few months when I've seen people who I thought had got it to an extent, who had bought the Obama myth as if somehow here out of nowhere is a change to the
[00:25:37.304 --> 00:25:46.708]  Well, to answer your question, I mean, what I think of it, they know things are bad and they want to believe a fairy tale.
[00:25:46.748 --> 00:25:48.489]  They want to think the nightmare is over.
[00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:51.270]  It's exactly because they are somewhat awake.
[00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:59.633]  That they're so afraid now at the reality that they are grasping at straws, you know, seeing things, mirages in the desert.
[00:25:59.653 --> 00:26:08.837]  A man dying of thirst will, you know, see huge lakes of cool, clean water to go drink and will even go crazy and think he's drinking water when he's throwing sand into his mouth.
[00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:15.720]  And you've written a great analysis breaking down the mass mind control, the real programs of Barack Obama.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.321]  We link to it at InfoWars.com, DavidIke.com.
[00:26:18.341 --> 00:26:19.001]  What's the article?
[00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:20.522]  The Emperor with No Clothes?
[00:26:21.062 --> 00:26:22.843]  It's Barack Obama, the Naked Emperor.
[00:26:23.143 --> 00:26:27.806]  You've introduced a very, very important point, Alex, in terms of mass mind control.
[00:26:28.227 --> 00:26:31.769]  It's the principle of the target wanting it to be true.
[00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:41.415]  And in many ways, the worse it gets, the more people can be enticed into following someone who's telling them what they want to be true.
[00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:47.479]  I mean, if you take what happened in Nazi Germany and those other examples you gave, at each point,
[00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.833]  People don't want to face the fact of the situation they're in.
[00:26:53.374 --> 00:26:57.036]  So they will believe when someone tells them, no, no, it's not that.
[00:26:57.096 --> 00:26:58.517]  Just do it for this reason.
[00:26:58.577 --> 00:26:59.878]  They want that to be true.
[00:26:59.958 --> 00:27:03.281]  And that's the most powerful form of control.
[00:27:03.401 --> 00:27:04.302]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:27:04.342 --> 00:27:05.723]  What's happened with Barack Obama?
[00:27:06.763 --> 00:27:10.346]  This whole technique of problem reaction solution we're now seeing in America.
[00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.791]  And indeed, globally, because of Obama's global influence.
[00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:16.151]  I mean, I was in Africa recently, a few weeks ago.
[00:27:16.211 --> 00:27:17.551]  I mean, crikey, he's a god there.
[00:27:18.432 --> 00:27:27.033]  I guess you can understand why, but if they knew the agenda they have for Africa, the people behind Obama, then he would be anything but a god.
[00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:33.895]  But the point is that we're seeing a problem-reaction-solution presidential game here.
[00:27:34.395 --> 00:27:38.816]  They brought Bush in, the people that control Bush, the neocons, and what they've done for eight years
[00:27:39.585 --> 00:27:46.173]  Is create massive problems, financial problems, overseas war problems, military problems, problems of every kind.
[00:27:46.253 --> 00:28:00.249]  And he was also arrogant and didn't care and lied and said, I don't read the newspaper, exactly a perfect psy-op what the Romans would do with a governor, give them an abusive governor, but then bring in a slicker governor who could engage in even more abuse and the people would accept him as a savior.
[00:28:00.942 --> 00:28:01.242]  Exactly.
[00:28:01.282 --> 00:28:09.850]  One of the interesting things between the mid-90s and about 2002, I did enormous amounts of research into mind control, individual and mass mind control.
[00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:23.003]  One of the staggering things you came across when you talked to some of these individual victims of mind control was that they had a, I wouldn't say a love, but they had this enormous affection
[00:28:23.942 --> 00:28:24.202]  I think?
[00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:37.932]  I don't
[00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:02.691]  A change in president has a change in direction.
[00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:11.196]  And all it is, in truth, is a new phase in the same direction towards this global or well-interior.
[00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:12.937]  They're just putting a new quarterback in.
[00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:13.938]  Exactly.
[00:29:13.998 --> 00:29:20.903]  And what Obama's been brought in to do, the salesman, well he's a salesman as long as he's reading someone else's words on autocue.
[00:29:21.363 --> 00:29:22.344]  We're on the march.
[00:29:22.544 --> 00:29:23.924]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.792 --> 00:29:58.793]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:01.053]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:30:01.373 --> 00:30:04.694]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:30:04.994 --> 00:30:05.674]  Be smart.
[00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:06.635]  Be safe.
[00:30:06.895 --> 00:30:08.875]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[00:30:54.872 --> 00:31:01.335]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:02.836]  And we knew what to do.
[00:31:02.856 --> 00:31:04.697]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:04.957 --> 00:31:10.039]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:11.359]  to tell their story.
[00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:20.544]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:27.687]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:31.049]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:36.392]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:31:36.933 --> 00:31:39.474]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:31:48.963 --> 00:31:53.887]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:31:55.831 --> 00:32:03.473]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?

[00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:14.873]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:23.042]  I want you to be sure to visit his fine website, scores of books and films and presentations, some of the most riveting and informative and mind-expanding out there.
[00:33:24.266 --> 00:33:25.586]  David Icke dot com.
[00:33:26.727 --> 00:33:31.468]  And when he's on with us, we'll also be putting his website up on screen for folks.
[00:33:31.928 --> 00:33:35.589]  We're also simulcasting the radio show right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:37.609]  There's David Icke dot com on screen.
[00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:41.370]  D-A-V-I-D-I-C-K-E dot com.
[00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:45.231]  Before we go back to David, the 9-11 Chronicles, the
[00:33:46.485 --> 00:33:48.567]  9-11 film that shows you the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:52.489]  Police trying to claim they're going to plant bombs on 9-11 truthers in New York.
[00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.472]  Claiming that cameras are guns, confiscating their cameras.
[00:33:56.092 --> 00:33:57.033]  We had hidden cameras.
[00:33:58.193 --> 00:33:59.554]  World leaders being confronted.
[00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:02.797]  Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:34:03.417 --> 00:34:03.998]  On and on and on.
[00:34:04.058 --> 00:34:05.419]  This is just such an amazing film.
[00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:06.360]  It's Cinema Verite.
[00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:07.822]  There's no voiceover in this.
[00:34:07.862 --> 00:34:09.744]  The one film I've made that's Cinema Verite style.
[00:34:10.124 --> 00:34:16.671]  Available as low as $6.95 at Infowars.com when you get it as part of group combo packages.
[00:34:17.191 --> 00:34:18.152]  And make copies of it.
[00:34:18.192 --> 00:34:18.933]  Get it out to people.
[00:34:18.993 --> 00:34:25.360]  That's why I've been offered big distribution deals by Universal and people and turned them down because I wouldn't be able to let you make copies.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.460]  We're good to go.
[00:34:45.154 --> 00:34:51.540]  We carry a lot of other books and videos like the Money Masters three and a half hour film for the price of a regular length film.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.085]  You'll have a master's degree in how the private central banks operate and what they're doing to us with this film at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:57.486 --> 00:35:06.995]  Jason Berman's 9-11 film, getting into the Israeli connection, the Pakistani connection, the NORAD stand down, the ghost planes, the doomsday aircraft running the attacks.
[00:35:07.535 --> 00:35:10.136]  It's just an unbelievable film, the latest 9-11 film out there.
[00:35:10.156 --> 00:35:17.517]  It's Fabled Enemies, also available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:17.537 --> 00:35:22.678]  You can call 24 hours a day, ask them about the combos and discounts.
[00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:30.220]  Hundreds of films and books and titles, not just my 21 films and the book I wrote and the other book I published, Paul Watson's Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror.
[00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:36.445]  Also, this live TV show will be archived at PrisonPlanet.tv in high quality within a few hours of the show being over.
[00:35:36.465 --> 00:35:46.994]  If you're not watching this live streaming right now, when you get home from work or whatever, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and see this interview in high quality if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member for 15 cents a day.
[00:35:47.014 --> 00:35:49.076]  I would also add supporting David Icke is key.
[00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:52.219]  He also has a similar members area of his site, DavidIcke.com.
[00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:54.421]  Okay, David, we've got a long segment here.
[00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:55.281]  Let's roll with it.
[00:35:56.022 --> 00:35:56.622]  Breakdown.
[00:35:56.642 --> 00:36:01.143]  I mean, he's clearly doing NLP, Mind Control Program, when he gives these speeches.
[00:36:01.423 --> 00:36:07.185]  The way both parties have gotten behind him, the way Pat Robertson is getting behind him, saying socialism's good, it will save us.
[00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:09.645]  Obama is unstoppable.
[00:36:10.026 --> 00:36:15.347]  We have Kissinger saying he is the man, the world's perception, this is an opportunity for a new world order.
[00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:22.234]  In fact, cue that video up, we'll play a clip of it later, just the part where Kissinger says that there halfway through the three minute clip.
[00:36:22.835 --> 00:36:30.584]  David, break down, David, what's happening with Barack Obama and how he's being sold and packaged as this messiah.
[00:36:31.605 --> 00:36:36.771]  Well, what they've done is used all the mass mind control techniques and the key one
[00:36:37.373 --> 00:36:46.529]  Is to turn him over the last year, two years into a blank screen on which the people project their own version of what he is.
[00:36:47.173 --> 00:36:47.413]  I don't
[00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:13.492]  I stand for hope and I stand for something to believe in.
[00:37:13.852 --> 00:37:20.215]  Now the change idea is very effective because of the way the system screws people.
[00:37:20.695 --> 00:37:28.278]  At any point in time, the vast numbers of people are not happy with their status quo, the way their life is.
[00:37:28.718 --> 00:37:30.639]  So anyone who comes along and starts saying,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:57.266]  I will change things is is immediately open to that because it will go well I don't like the way things are change yeah change I mean Clinton did this when he got elected for the first time and so they created a blank screen with Obama on which the people projected their version of what those themes meant and so we became all things to all men and all women those who could see through him that is
[00:37:58.154 --> 00:38:03.364]  And that's got him elected, and what it's done, and I'm sure that there have been
[00:38:04.424 --> 00:38:19.439]  Many other subliminal, even technological, I would say definitely technological effects that have been attacks on the human perception, so that they have actually started to see this guy in messianic terms.
[00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:25.324]  I mean, I've spoken to people and I think, you know, I'm going to click my fingers in a minute, mate, so you wake up when they're talking about this fellow.
[00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:26.826]  And I found that in Africa as well.
[00:38:27.386 --> 00:38:28.748]  So he's going to get this
[00:38:29.753 --> 00:38:30.093]  I think.
[00:38:45.134 --> 00:38:57.036]  They have this agenda and they want to push it on as fast as possible, and they understand this honeymoon period, anything goes for Obama, following January the 20th, that we're going to see things kick off real quick.
[00:38:58.656 --> 00:39:02.677]  We're going to see a blitzkrieg of activity before the public wakes up.
[00:39:02.777 --> 00:39:05.778]  And going back, look at all his betrayals, though.
[00:39:05.818 --> 00:39:10.818]  To get the anti-war movement that swept the Democrats into Congress in 2006, behind him, his handler,
[00:39:13.979 --> 00:39:15.802]  Who brought him and Governor Blagojevich up.
[00:39:16.282 --> 00:39:30.963]  Rahm Emanuel, who's an IDF officer, not only an American citizen, or dual citizen, a foreign Mossad operative, he openly is the biggest pro-war person in the Democratic Party, but it's come out now, he told Obama, lie and say you're against it.
[00:39:31.423 --> 00:39:34.964]  And then now he's the Chief of Staff, so just incredible betrayal.
[00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:38.545]  The wiretapping against the Americans, flip-flop on that.
[00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:40.846]  Now he wants to confront Russia.
[00:39:40.866 --> 00:39:47.248]  I mean, Obama is doing 180 degrees from what he claimed he'd do, but now he's not saying anything.
[00:39:47.288 --> 00:39:50.229]  He's not weighing in on Gaza, on nothing.
[00:39:50.269 --> 00:39:51.870]  He's just sitting there and being our savior.
[00:39:52.722 --> 00:39:56.665]  Well, Obama's not just a blank screen in the way I've just described.
[00:39:56.705 --> 00:40:01.689]  He's also a blank mind in terms of his own intellect.
[00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:03.430]  He's just a front man.
[00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.273]  He's a salesman for the people behind him, not least the big new Brzezinski.
[00:40:07.754 --> 00:40:13.899]  And it's interesting that if you read Brzezinski's books and then you hear Obama's policies, they kind of mirror each other.
[00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:18.562]  I got a quote here from a Brzezinski book before anyone had heard of Obama nationally.
[00:40:19.223 --> 00:40:22.025]  And it said, this is Brzezinski writing,
[00:40:22.606 --> 00:40:30.238]  Needed social reassessment can be encouraged by deliberate civic education that stretches the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself.
[00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:43.174]  As some have occasionally urged, a major step in that direction would be the adoption of an obligatory period of national service for every young adult, perhaps involving a variety of congressionally approved domestic or foreign good works.
[00:40:43.534 --> 00:40:53.017]  Now of course, Obama has been talking about exactly that, and this is a key phrase here in terms of Obama, that stresses the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself.
[00:40:53.437 --> 00:40:57.118]  This is going to be one of the great ways that Obama sells the tyranny.
[00:40:57.739 --> 00:41:13.326]  He's going to sell it as people coming together, as serving a higher cause, and again and again you hear him, not just him but his wife as well in some of her speeches, talk about the fact that America is going to have to sacrifice to bring about this change.
[00:41:13.726 --> 00:41:17.828]  And one of the key sacrifices, without any question, is going to be sacrificing their
[00:41:19.148 --> 00:41:22.049]  Sovereignty and ability to govern themselves.
[00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:33.132]  And that's why Colin Powell and Vice President Biden-elect are all saying, get ready for things that are unpopular when they're speaking to inner core groups of Democrats around the country.
[00:41:33.172 --> 00:41:34.573]  It's been caught on tape a few times.
[00:41:34.873 --> 00:41:37.854]  They're saying the people aren't going to like any of this.
[00:41:38.254 --> 00:41:40.714]  And that's raiding the pension funds, starting new wars.
[00:41:40.895 --> 00:41:43.675]  And there's also this classic mind control.
[00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:45.176]  I want you to speak to this particular
[00:41:45.996 --> 00:41:46.416]  Tactic.
[00:41:46.736 --> 00:42:08.021]  They'll announce, we want world government, world government's good, New World Order's good, New World Order means world government, then they'll say, but I didn't just say that, and you're insane if you're against world government, and if you believe in world government, it exists, and if you think it's good, it exists, but if you don't want world government, you're insane, it doesn't exist, and then we've seen, again, all these publications announcing world government in our face.
[00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:10.062]  It's the same thing with Obama.
[00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:10.842]  There's just this
[00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:22.944]  Almost like they're testing being ridiculous, lying in public, doing asinine things, and studying re-education camps in Soviet Russia and Communist China.
[00:42:25.478 --> 00:42:26.298]  That's what they did.
[00:42:26.338 --> 00:42:28.460]  They made the interrogations crazy.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.682]  They made people change what they were saying and believing every day.
[00:42:32.742 --> 00:42:35.103]  They would say, I'll quit torturing you when you say you agree with this.
[00:42:35.223 --> 00:42:35.903]  Okay, I agree.
[00:42:36.103 --> 00:42:37.164]  They'd still go ahead and torture you.
[00:42:37.404 --> 00:42:38.825]  Now you have to say you believe in that.
[00:42:39.225 --> 00:42:52.692]  And it goes back to O'Brien in 1984 where, of course, Eric Blair, George Orwell was writing about being a former secret police member in India and then a propagandist at BBC at this mind control program of setting the precedence
[00:42:53.232 --> 00:42:58.815]  Yeah, one of the things that they're always doing is pushing things as far as they can and they're looking for a public reaction.
[00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.450]  I don't know.
[00:43:29.333 --> 00:43:29.814]  I don't
[00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:44.971]  Thank you.
[00:44:03.482 --> 00:44:08.104]  Carry out every single bit of seizing your infrastructure to put international toll roads on it.
[00:44:08.144 --> 00:44:09.985]  So there's the example right there.
[00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:15.687]  Meanwhile, I'm on national radio debates and the talk show host laughs at me and says none of this even exists.
[00:44:16.724 --> 00:44:18.086]  Yeah, that's the way they work.
[00:44:18.806 --> 00:44:29.359]  In terms of Obama, we've got a mass mind control operation behind him that's far more sophisticated than I've come across.
[00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:30.099]  This is really a step up.
[00:44:36.647 --> 00:44:44.349]  Well you said it, they're using every science they've developed together, overlaid, working on all eight cylinders, like I've never seen.
[00:44:44.489 --> 00:44:53.812]  And normally they would play off the left-right paradigm with both parties for the illusion of that the Congress and the President really run things and aren't just front puppets.
[00:44:54.233 --> 00:45:00.534]  You know, for the real guys upstairs, as you've said so many times, for the first time ever they're telling us we must be unified.
[00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:04.956]  And for me, that is the signal that they are really moving into a new phase.
[00:45:06.178 --> 00:45:07.279]  Well, it was interesting.
[00:45:07.299 --> 00:45:16.791]  Years and years ago, when I was researching this back in the early 90s, I came across a lady called Kitty Little, who was an Oxford Don.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:27.144]  And she told me that she attended a talk by someone at Oxford University in like the 1940s.
[00:45:27.885 --> 00:45:34.428]  And she got into this meeting, which was a closed meeting, because they thought she had certain political views and she didn't.
[00:45:34.528 --> 00:45:36.449]  And so she was an interloper and they didn't know.
[00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:41.131]  And this man stood up and he made the speech and he said that
[00:45:42.145 --> 00:45:45.227]  There was an organisation that had no name.
[00:45:45.267 --> 00:45:49.129]  He said, we don't give it a name because it's much more difficult to track it down if it doesn't have a name.
[00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:53.432]  He said it has a political wing and it has what he called a biological wing.
[00:45:54.152 --> 00:45:57.594]  The head of the biological wing was Lord Rick Rothschild.
[00:45:58.215 --> 00:46:00.936]  And he, he said, was the head of that time of the political wing.
[00:46:00.976 --> 00:46:05.079]  And he said, as a result, there was going to come a point where he was going to become Prime Minister of Britain.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.361]  And his name was Harold Wilson.
[00:46:08.812 --> 00:46:14.095]  And he became Prime Minister of Britain in the early 60s, and apart from four years, until 1975.
[00:46:15.235 --> 00:46:36.686]  But what he said in that speech was that the infiltrators of this conspiracy were going to go into the right wing of the Labour Party, which was perceived then as a left-wing party, and they were going to go into the left wing of the Conservative Party, which was perceived as a right-wing party, because he said,
[00:46:37.432 --> 00:46:41.655]  People instinctively don't like extremists, so we're going to pose as moderates.
[00:46:42.075 --> 00:46:54.743]  He said, and what's going to happen is from control of both these parties, we're going to fuse them together to the point where they become one party under two names or three names with the Liberal Party.
[00:46:55.203 --> 00:47:04.829]  And what has happened in this country from the end of Margaret Thatcher onwards, particularly when Blair came in, is that is precisely what has happened.
[00:47:05.209 --> 00:47:05.490]  We're good.
[00:47:22.353 --> 00:47:22.453]  The
[00:47:43.587 --> 00:48:03.886]  No separation, and remember last year, David, in England it came out that the House of Commons was being spied on by MI5, all their phones were being listened to, but that the main focus was on the few little parties that weren't controlled, and that they weren't worried about the three major parties, because those were basically already run by the intelligence apparatus.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.340]  Yeah, well you've got Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.861]  You've got David Cameron, the leader of the opposition.
[00:48:09.801 --> 00:48:15.682]  They use different words and they criticise each other, but you look at their basic policies and what they would do in power.
[00:48:15.722 --> 00:48:17.383]  It's precisely the same.
[00:48:17.843 --> 00:48:29.945]  And so it shows how far along the road we've now come, where even the pseudo-fighting that went on before is now fusing into this one-party state.
[00:48:29.965 --> 00:48:32.406]  And what they've done with Obama is turned him into a
[00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:37.463]  A public Demo-Republican, if you like.
[00:48:37.984 --> 00:48:40.328]  A Republo-Democrat, whatever you want to call it.
[00:48:40.628 --> 00:48:45.876]  They're putting him right in that centre ground, in the public mind, of bringing people together.
[00:48:46.217 --> 00:48:47.238]  But actually he is a...
[00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:56.697]  A massive extremist who owes more to the fascist state of mind, especially the people behind him, than any socialist state of mind.
[00:48:56.737 --> 00:49:00.718]  Although if you go far enough left and far enough right, you meet the same situation anyways.
[00:49:00.758 --> 00:49:03.478]  And then we get into colors, using colors to program.
[00:49:03.498 --> 00:49:09.999]  Have you noticed that he and his wife, the night they won, both wore red and black and so did their children?
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.120]  Again, there's major messages in that.
[00:49:13.154 --> 00:49:19.617]  Yeah, I mean, they understand the way that vibrational codes affect people.
[00:49:19.997 --> 00:49:21.678]  And colors are vibrational codes.
[00:49:22.218 --> 00:49:25.380]  Different colors and different shades of colors.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.720]  And that's the fascist color.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.201]  Red, black and white.
[00:49:28.781 --> 00:49:32.323]  And it affects you in a certain way and they speak to the subconscious mind.
[00:49:32.583 --> 00:49:39.046]  But I think one of the key things that we're going to see with Obama is the creation of a situation where
[00:49:40.363 --> 00:49:45.526]  If you're not for him, then you somehow need to be marginalized.
[00:49:45.666 --> 00:49:47.527]  And you're causing the economy to get worse.
[00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:49.108]  They're already saying that.
[00:49:49.228 --> 00:49:58.512]  If you do exactly what they say, and you don't question, and you go to the work brigades, and you hand your children over, and you spy on your neighbors, and you pay all these carbon taxes, things will be fixed.
[00:49:58.532 --> 00:49:59.353]  That's the solution.
[00:49:59.633 --> 00:50:05.536]  But if you stand in the way of the solution, you've got to be removed because you're the cause of the problem.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.883]  Yeah, I mean, when these demigods and tyrannies come to power, I mean, Hitler's a classic example.
[00:50:12.523 --> 00:50:21.608]  Anyone that is against them is attacked, is marginalized, is abused, is libeled and slandered.
[00:50:22.709 --> 00:50:29.012]  And it's designed to stop people being that nail that stands out above the rest, as the Japanese say.
[00:50:31.213 --> 00:50:31.673]  David, stay there.
[00:50:31.693 --> 00:50:32.794]  We'll come back and continue with that.
[00:50:33.374 --> 00:50:35.255]  I want to talk to you, too, about a backfire, though.
[00:50:35.515 --> 00:50:36.536]  I'm seeing a backfire here.
[00:50:36.996 --> 00:50:44.420]  Because the system has lost so much credibility, people instinctively now, they see someone being attacked, think, ah, they must be good.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.982]  Okay, so what's happening there is the system loses more and more credibility.
[00:50:49.342 --> 00:50:49.862]  Stay with us.
[00:50:49.962 --> 00:50:52.464]  David Icke, compelling information.
[00:50:52.504 --> 00:50:53.144]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:58.792]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[00:50:59.092 --> 00:51:01.233]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[00:51:01.674 --> 00:51:02.734]  Why settle for less?
[00:51:03.094 --> 00:51:04.355]  There is an alternative.
[00:51:04.735 --> 00:51:06.195]  InternetGrocer.net.

[00:51:09.957 --> 00:51:13.539]  Enjoy creamy, delicious, real cheddar cheese in a can.
[00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:16.640]  Indulge in real canned meats and real canned butter.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:23.728]  Storable meals from InternetGrocer.net will bring such variety and flavor you won't be able to tell you're actually eating storable food.

[00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:28.954]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.
[00:51:29.214 --> 00:51:34.340]  InternetGrocer.net has non-hybrid seeds that will produce delicious food for you and your family.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.220]  Ensure your food supply for years.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.301]  Find out just how delicious storable food can be.
[00:51:39.561 --> 00:51:42.142]  Call 903-356-6443.
[00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:45.862]  That's 903-356-6443.
[00:51:46.182 --> 00:51:47.023]  Open from 9 a.m.
[00:51:47.063 --> 00:51:47.743]  to 6 p.m.
[00:51:47.803 --> 00:51:48.783]  Central Standard Time.
[00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:52.044]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[00:51:52.284 --> 00:51:54.884]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[00:51:55.504 --> 00:52:01.786]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:02.146 --> 00:52:03.826]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:04.781 --> 00:52:05.802]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:06.322 --> 00:52:06.822]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:07.122 --> 00:52:08.143]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:08.163 --> 00:52:09.463]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:09.483 --> 00:52:11.144]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:11.484 --> 00:52:18.248]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:18.628 --> 00:52:19.068]  Some U.S.
[00:52:19.108 --> 00:52:24.791]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:25.451 --> 00:52:28.974]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:29.275 --> 00:52:31.757]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:55.515 --> 00:52:58.896]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:04.257]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:53:04.437 --> 00:53:09.218]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:53:09.598 --> 00:53:20.640]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:26.661]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:32.962]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:33.142 --> 00:53:33.803]  What about you?

[00:53:53.446 --> 00:53:59.268]  Yes, we've been trotted on the wine spray.
[00:53:59.348 --> 00:54:01.529]  Much too long, three bell.
[00:54:01.749 --> 00:54:02.789]  Three bell.
[00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:08.431]  Popular system is the vampire.
[00:54:15.106 --> 00:54:24.132]  David Icke is our guest for another 40 minutes.
[00:54:25.613 --> 00:54:32.197]  He'll open the phones up in the next hour.
[00:54:32.218 --> 00:54:32.278]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:45.694 --> 00:54:47.975]  We're fighting the technological enslavement system.
[00:54:47.995 --> 00:54:53.138]  We're fighting the final revolution of the elite against humanity, trying to make themselves gods.
[00:54:53.578 --> 00:55:05.765]  I want to get into the genetic engineering, why they're destroying the environment in the name of saving it, what their final endgame is if we don't defeat them, and more about us being empowered and taking action that you speak so elegantly to, David.
[00:55:05.785 --> 00:55:08.847]  But continue with the point you were making when we got interrupted by the break.
[00:55:10.649 --> 00:55:24.752]  Well, I just feel that, you know, Obama is going to be put up there in a situation where you're either for him and you're a good guy, or you're challenging him and you're just trying to destroy America.
[00:55:24.812 --> 00:55:34.374]  And the other thing that is going to be played, although he's talking all the time about, oh no, racism and all this stuff, the race card's going to be played as well.
[00:55:34.454 --> 00:55:38.635]  People who attack him, they're going to be called racist, and it's just because he's a black president.
[00:55:38.755 --> 00:55:41.056]  Oh, David, David, David, I know this has happened to you.
[00:55:41.536 --> 00:55:46.677]  On my website, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, we'll write an article with Rahm Emanuel saying compulsory service.
[00:55:46.997 --> 00:55:50.278]  We'll say we're against it, and every other comment is, you just hate black people.
[00:55:50.719 --> 00:55:52.979]  But then I notice it's mainly white yuppies saying it.
[00:55:53.319 --> 00:55:55.220]  Are they programmed, or are those disinfo?
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:56:01.422]  Well, that's an interesting point, and I would make this point very strongly.
[00:56:03.146 --> 00:56:05.608]  You know, I've got a great friend in Africa.
[00:56:05.668 --> 00:56:08.791]  He's a Zulu shaman, a very well-known man in South Africa.
[00:56:08.811 --> 00:56:14.035]  He's in his 80s now, and his perception of Obama is absolutely spot-on.
[00:56:14.376 --> 00:56:16.037]  He wrote a poem that's on your website.
[00:56:16.057 --> 00:56:16.337]  Yeah.
[00:56:16.357 --> 00:56:18.019]  Do you want me to give you a few lines from it?
[00:56:18.379 --> 00:56:18.980]  Read the whole poem.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.480]  Go ahead.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:19.920]  Okay.
[00:56:20.901 --> 00:56:25.145]  He wrote this poem after he saw Obama speaking on television.
[00:56:25.763 --> 00:56:30.745]  An actor walks upon the floodlit stage of life, wearing a mask of an angel beneath a demon's crown.
[00:56:31.325 --> 00:56:32.025]  A gown, rather.
[00:56:32.105 --> 00:56:36.907]  Pretense smiles upon the crowded hall of life, holding out hope as bright as it is false.
[00:56:37.667 --> 00:56:45.490]  Son of a woman in whose veins flows the blood of ancient Ireland and dark Africa's plains, you are Obama, nicknamed the Standing King.
[00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:47.871]  You are Barak, O son born to deceive.
[00:56:48.593 --> 00:56:50.674]  The suffering hordes of Africa look up to you.
[00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:54.014]  See a black saviour where naught but a Judas strides.
[00:56:54.675 --> 00:56:57.335]  An entrapper of nations, bringer of dismal war.
[00:56:57.995 --> 00:57:03.137]  Behind the robes and the nylon wings of hope, oh may those who look up to you see you as you are.
[00:57:03.617 --> 00:57:06.217]  May those who hope in you behold you as you are.
[00:57:06.658 --> 00:57:09.478]  A prince deceitful to bring down Africa's shrines.
[00:57:09.738 --> 00:57:13.239]  A siren who leads Africa's ships onto rocks of obliteration.
[00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:16.100]  Your rule, my lord, will not be one of peace.
[00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:17.010]  You're
[00:57:36.153 --> 00:57:48.065]  Well, David, the first thing he's doing is massively increasing, and even the Huffington Post liberals are reporting this, massive forced abortion eugenics funding in Africa, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:57:48.725 --> 00:57:50.167]  I mean, he's just going after them.
[00:57:54.964 --> 00:57:55.244]  I think?
[00:58:12.032 --> 00:58:14.312]  And that black overclass does not answer.
[00:58:14.433 --> 00:58:19.173]  This is the Obamas and the Jesse Jacksons and the Oprah Winfrey's and the Jay-Z's.
[00:58:19.493 --> 00:58:23.794]  That doesn't answer in terms of its allegiance to black people in general.
[00:58:23.914 --> 00:58:28.735]  It answers to the white overclass, the bloodlines that run the... Stay there, David.
[00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:29.215]  Stay there.
[00:58:29.235 --> 00:58:30.436]  70 second break.
[00:58:30.636 --> 00:58:33.216]  We'll be right back with David Icke in the final hour.
[00:58:33.236 --> 00:58:38.037]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:58.402]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:58:58.842 --> 00:59:05.608]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:59:05.928 --> 00:59:09.489]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:59:09.889 --> 00:59:13.069]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.010]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:20.791]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:59:39.459 --> 00:59:44.783]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:59:48.005 --> 00:59:49.946]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:53.169]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.168 --> 01:00:08.191]  1-800-259-9231 is the number.
[01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:15.354]  We'll take five or six phone calls, four David Icke quick questions or comments coming up.
[01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:16.835]  You'll be with us for the next 40 minutes.
[01:00:16.855 --> 01:00:21.017]  Then I'm going to do a news blitz and have a little special surprise for everybody.
[01:00:22.526 --> 01:00:25.492]  Right at the end of the show today, you know I love surprises.
[01:00:25.512 --> 01:00:29.840]  David Icke, I want to go to calls in about 15 minutes.
[01:00:31.645 --> 01:00:35.609]  Though everything you say is so thought-provoking, I want to back you up and add to what you're saying.
[01:00:35.629 --> 01:00:54.464]  I'm going to attempt to shut up for the next 15 minutes and let you get into whatever subjects or areas you want, including solutions that you were finishing up with the black management overclass of the Judas Goat class that is tied into the New World Order just as much as George Bush or anybody else.
[01:00:54.804 --> 01:00:55.505]  Please continue.
[01:00:56.385 --> 01:01:05.494]  Yeah, this black overclass answers to the overwhelmingly white network of the Illuminati families.
[01:01:05.634 --> 01:01:08.817]  Well, almost entirely white network of the Illuminati families.
[01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:10.638]  And that's their allegiance.
[01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:17.465]  So just because a black face comes into the presidency or a black face comes into this position or that position doesn't mean
[01:01:18.257 --> 01:01:25.205]  By definition, he has allegiance to other people of that race in that country.
[01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:26.907]  His allegiance is to himself.
[01:01:26.967 --> 01:01:32.713]  His allegiance, therefore, is to those that he gets his rewards from and he gets his power from.
[01:01:33.033 --> 01:01:38.159]  So he's going to play their agenda out, not what he's right for.
[01:01:39.011 --> 01:01:43.232]  Poor black people and others in America.
[01:01:43.573 --> 01:01:44.873]  And that's what we're going to see.
[01:01:44.953 --> 01:01:53.416]  But he's going to play the race card, or it's going to be played for him, as you quite rightly quote Emmanuel there, where anyone who's against him is somehow racist.
[01:01:53.756 --> 01:01:55.697]  I mean, you get this when you challenge Zionism.
[01:01:55.717 --> 01:01:56.397]  You're a racist.
[01:01:56.437 --> 01:01:56.877]  No, I'm not.
[01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:58.778]  I'm against slaughtering innocent people.
[01:01:59.798 --> 01:02:00.858]  But we're going to see all of this.
[01:02:00.898 --> 01:02:06.060]  And this is why those that are standing up against this and
[01:02:06.878 --> 01:02:12.360]  Those that are becoming aware of it, we need to get the backbones stiffened up.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:33.787]  We need to do what we know to be right and not be intimidated by all this stuff that's coming along and will come along to try to intimidate people into silence, including, as you're well aware, talk show hosts, where he's even talking about having to have every side of every story covered and you can't have an opinion, basically.
[01:02:35.677 --> 01:02:36.598]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:41.360]  It's that comfort zone you talk about.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.162]  We have to get outside the comfort zones.
[01:02:43.182 --> 01:02:45.923]  Those are really little prisons used to control us.
[01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.565]  And if we don't stop caring what people think about us, it's over.
[01:02:50.377 --> 01:02:50.937]  Yes, it is.
[01:02:51.858 --> 01:02:55.099]  What we've got to do is let go of fear, and what we've got to do is become conscious.
[01:02:55.159 --> 01:03:02.281]  I might be getting into some deep levels here, but there are many, many different levels to this, Alex.
[01:03:02.861 --> 01:03:09.283]  One of them is, very clearly to me after many, many years of this, is that we live in a virtual reality universe.
[01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:17.243]  Virtual Reality Universe, this matrix, is actually founded on a four-letter word, what we call mind.
[01:03:17.803 --> 01:03:20.304]  What we call mind is actually not consciousness.
[01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:34.029]  It is like a computer program, like they're building now biological computers that don't just have the ability to react to input and do what they're dictated to do by programmers.
[01:03:34.329 --> 01:03:39.670]  They have the ability, these computers, to assess information and actually make decisions based on that information.
[01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:40.831]  And if you go
[01:03:41.591 --> 01:03:42.051]  I don't
[01:04:00.672 --> 01:04:01.313]  I don't think so.
[01:04:20.406 --> 01:04:20.967]  I think so.
[01:04:31.596 --> 01:04:33.458]  It's like flipping a switch.
[01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:34.558]  Stay there, David.
[01:04:34.578 --> 01:04:35.099]  We got a break.
[01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:41.504]  We'll come back, continue with what you're breaking down, unlocking the mind to the larger universe, and then we'll take phone calls.
[01:04:41.524 --> 01:04:41.984]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.655 --> 01:04:58.919]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.185]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:05:03.345 --> 01:05:11.316]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:05:11.596 --> 01:05:14.779]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:05:14.999 --> 01:05:25.508]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:05:25.808 --> 01:05:33.814]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:05:34.015 --> 01:05:40.640]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare
[01:05:44.158 --> 01:05:48.962]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:49.222 --> 01:05:50.603]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:05.047 --> 01:06:05.888]  Who is the enemy?
[01:06:06.408 --> 01:06:06.909]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:07.209 --> 01:06:08.169]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:08.189 --> 01:06:09.550]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:11.232]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:11.572 --> 01:06:18.317]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:18.717 --> 01:06:19.158]  Some U.S.
[01:06:19.198 --> 01:06:24.842]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:29.005]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:29.025 --> 01:06:31.207]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:55.322 --> 01:07:01.028]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[01:07:01.168 --> 01:07:11.058]  The original Can-C eye drop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing, and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[01:07:11.158 --> 01:07:15.542]  Can-C can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[01:07:15.642 --> 01:07:19.306]  Can-C is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders,
[01:07:19.446 --> 01:07:20.086]  We're good.
[01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:37.513]  Big Brother.
[01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:02.493]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.315]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:04.976 --> 01:08:05.797]  You want answers?
[01:08:06.578 --> 01:08:07.479]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:07.499 --> 01:08:11.844]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:16.350]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:17.230]  Welcome back.
[01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:17.991]  We are live.
[01:08:18.071 --> 01:08:21.913]  We've got about 52 minutes left in this live broadcast.
[01:08:22.313 --> 01:08:24.194]  We'll be doing your phone calls in about 8-9 minutes.
[01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:28.976]  Anna, David, John, Mark, and many others that are patiently holding before we go back to David Icke.
[01:08:29.517 --> 01:08:35.379]  The sponsor of the day, making this transmission possible, is survivalofseeds.com.
[01:08:35.419 --> 01:08:36.980]  It's all about getting back to the land.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.482]  These are heirloom seeds, ladies and gentlemen, heirloom seeds.
[01:08:40.962 --> 01:08:41.803]  No GMO.
[01:08:42.263 --> 01:08:44.164]  They're not even hybrid.
[01:08:44.924 --> 01:08:46.025]  These are, some of these
[01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:48.446]  200, 300-year-old seed variety.
[01:08:48.466 --> 01:08:50.928]  Some of these came over on the Mayflower.
[01:08:50.988 --> 01:08:53.550]  Check out the website survivalofseeds.com.
[01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:57.272]  Grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a day and break free of the New World Order.
[01:08:57.292 --> 01:09:01.435]  15,000 heirloom seeds will provide you and your family seven years of healthy food.
[01:09:01.795 --> 01:09:04.517]  Stop buying New World Order GMO food.
[01:09:04.958 --> 01:09:06.879]  Start growing real healthy food in your backyard.
[01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:07.339]  15,000 heirloom seeds.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.206]  A real food insurance policy for difficult times.
[01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:14.533]  Heirloom seeds are the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[01:09:14.574 --> 01:09:16.217]  The seeds date back over a century.
[01:09:16.498 --> 01:09:18.342]  The Mayflower bean came over in the Mayflower.
[01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:29.994]  Survivalistseeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers and sell them back your safe seeds year after year because demand is skyrocketing for the rare heirloom seeds.
[01:09:30.014 --> 01:09:35.437]  The globalists are buying up a lot of the companies, the majority of them, and not allowing the public to buy them anymore.
[01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:40.580]  So it's harder and harder to get them and they're building all these emergency seed bunkers.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.283]  I want to ask separately, David, about the whole biological takeover, why the globalists
[01:09:44.983 --> 01:09:54.230]  just just feverishly cross-species spider goats cloned milk in stores uh... to the point of having a label it now cloned or not cloned i showed that on t.v.
[01:09:54.250 --> 01:10:14.324]  yesterday if i could have that other further for me please i want to show that again it won't believe it uh... survival of seeds dot com folks be sure and check them out today uh... and please again visit info wars dot com a prison planet dot com and check out the films like in game terror storm uh... truth arising fabled enemies not only does it support us
[01:10:15.236 --> 01:10:19.358]  But it also gets the word out, and people are really ready to hear the truth now.
[01:10:19.938 --> 01:10:26.422]  David, I want to continue with The Awakening, but I did want to ask you, are you not pleased?
[01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:35.346]  I mean, I'm seeing in the hundreds of interviews I do every month or so, in my own show, and people on the street, that the majority of callers to shows are not even my own.
[01:10:35.366 --> 01:10:36.667]  It can even be a hostile radio show.
[01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:38.528]  The callers call in agreeing with me.
[01:10:40.058 --> 01:10:53.829]  And the people now are really ready to hear the truth, and I see a paradigm shift, and I think that's why the globalists are crashing things, so that they can be the only savior and feed the people and clothe the people, bringing us into this collectivist model.
[01:10:54.109 --> 01:11:00.154]  I mean, is not this whole New World Order takeover a response to their attempt to fully dominate us before we break free of their conditioning?
[01:11:02.585 --> 01:11:14.035]  I've been writing for years that there was a change coming, a change coming that was going to wake up vast, vast numbers of people, like a spiritual alarm clock, if you like, waking people up.
[01:11:15.657 --> 01:11:17.699]  Waking people up is absolutely the phrase.
[01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:21.222]  It's breaking the amnesic state that people live in.
[01:11:21.762 --> 01:11:44.036]  And, you know, going back to what I was talking about before the break, you know, this is a big focus, the focus of my work at this time, and I'm accumulating now enormous amounts of information about the fact that this is a virtual reality universe, and what we call mind is a construct of this virtual reality, this matrix.
[01:11:44.616 --> 01:11:50.380]  And if you are stuck in mind, then you are a program, basically,
[01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:52.811]  I've got a question for you.
[01:12:18.966 --> 01:12:42.092]  When you do that, instead of looking close up at a brick symbolically, as you become more and more conscious, you're moving further and further back from the brick to the top of the hill, and now you see that what you were looking at, the brick, was actually part of a house, which was part of a street, which was part of a city, which was part of a country, etc.
[01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:45.213]  You're seeing what you were in, and you're seeing that
[01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:46.330]  What do you
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.001]  It's a good question.
[01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:32.317]  So what's happening with this awakening, Alex, is as people break out of the amnesic state, controlled by mind into consciousness, they're starting to see what they couldn't see before.
[01:13:32.377 --> 01:13:35.080]  People say to me, it's so obvious, mate, why didn't I see it before?
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.263]  Because you were entrapped in mind.
[01:13:37.783 --> 01:13:38.144]  I've got a
[01:13:54.828 --> 01:13:57.170]  Uh, so-called elite Oxford students sometimes.
[01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:01.752]  They're the most difficult people to talk to compared with the general public about these things.
[01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:16.241]  But some old, some old starving person in Venezuela on the street, uh, or sometimes a poor homeless person, I'll talk to them, you'll just think they're some old drunk and it turns out they're incredibly aware and tuned into the universe and even know what you're thinking.
[01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:34.532]  They get it, but people who have been through the system, particularly the elite ones who have been through the system to a greater level than anyone else, they're programming into mind, into intellect, which is a desperately stupid, compared with consciousness, level of awareness.
[01:14:34.612 --> 01:14:41.156]  Because they're so specialized, they're so specialized to be inserted into the interlocking pyramids you talk so much about.
[01:14:41.636 --> 01:14:43.997]  Yeah, this is the whole point, you know, Alex, when you look at it.
[01:14:44.817 --> 01:14:52.379]  The whole system, the whole education system, is designed to turn out mind intellects.
[01:14:53.659 --> 01:14:56.260]  It's about passing exams, which is what?
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:05.843]  Taking information that they tell you to believe and regurgitating it out onto exam paper, and the better you do that, the more you progress within the system.
[01:15:05.863 --> 01:15:06.123]  You then
[01:15:07.153 --> 01:15:08.154]  We're good to go.
[01:15:36.596 --> 01:15:37.237]  That's a good question.
[01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:50.485]  I'm
[01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:07.978]  This is wrong.
[01:16:08.139 --> 01:16:12.283]  And they're the ones that are refusing to serve in the military and going to jail as a result.
[01:16:12.504 --> 01:16:21.134]  Because consciousness is getting them to see the situation from the point of view of what's right, what's just, what's fair.
[01:16:21.758 --> 01:16:21.998]  I don't
[01:16:38.909 --> 01:16:42.192]  The physical body becomes a vehicle to experience this reality.
[01:16:42.212 --> 01:16:53.340]  It doesn't become who you are, and then racism and division through race and division through country suddenly starts to fall, and we start to realize we're all one consciousness having different experiences.
[01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:54.081]  Okay, start.
[01:16:54.682 --> 01:16:55.582]  What's happened, Alex?
[01:16:55.642 --> 01:16:58.444]  And the conspiracy is fundamentally set up to do this.
[01:16:58.925 --> 01:17:04.009]  The idea is to get us to identify who we are with our experience
[01:17:04.449 --> 01:17:07.930]  Rather than what we really are, which is consciousness having the experience.
[01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:20.235]  Instead of being our base, you know, galactic programming of this ancient species in this wondrous universe, they're trying to give us the new false programming to stay within that very limited spectrum as you talk so much about.
[01:17:20.255 --> 01:17:23.536]  And we're almost out of time, and I promised to go to call, so we're going to go to break in a moment.
[01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:26.157]  We're going to come back and take calls for two short segments with David.
[01:17:26.197 --> 01:17:27.377]  We've got to have you back soon, David.
[01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:29.798]  We're very thankful and appreciative of your important time.
[01:17:30.158 --> 01:17:32.739]  And I know the audience is, but briefly, in the three minutes before break.
[01:17:33.789 --> 01:17:44.157]  The genetic engineering, the cloning of the milk, all of this that is now going on and happening, the cross-species engineering, the mass poisoning of the public.
[01:17:44.538 --> 01:17:54.606]  Why is the elite pushing to destroy the biosphere of the earth while grandstanding and claiming they've got to have world taxes to save it with carbon dioxide that's a red herring?
[01:17:54.706 --> 01:17:57.288]  Why do they want to destroy the earth and hurt the environment?
[01:17:57.828 --> 01:18:00.089]  Well, this actually goes on for what we've been talking about.
[01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:07.993]  If you take one step back and you start to see what we're dealing with here, from their point of view, particularly from their point of view, the human body is a computer system.
[01:18:09.054 --> 01:18:11.895]  And what we call genetics is actually a computer program.
[01:18:12.816 --> 01:18:17.658]  And what they're doing by messing with genetically modified food and all these other
[01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:18.523]  Thank you.
[01:18:30.322 --> 01:18:49.968]  So if you destabilize it electromagnetically or chemically, you're destabilizing it, you're stopping it working efficiently, you're stopping it being a highly efficient receiver transmitter for consciousness to experience through it and to influence its behavior, you're disconnecting it from consciousness and putting it into the mind.
[01:18:49.988 --> 01:18:54.430]  Which is what the mercury and the poisons and the GMO, and we get the government documents,
[01:18:55.050 --> 01:19:05.204]  And when we get them out of England and out of Russia and the US, it says we've got to poison them when they're young so they never fully develop and they're literally like biological androids.
[01:19:05.504 --> 01:19:12.534]  That's exactly the game and this is why, again, the point you made earlier, I've been talking about this for years,
[01:19:13.263 --> 01:19:23.609]  This massive assault on human freedom, on the human body, on the human mind, is because this period of change, this cycle is coming, and it's waking people up.
[01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:28.673]  And they're desperately trying to keep the lid down so that they can control for the next cycle.
[01:19:29.573 --> 01:19:37.198]  And therefore, they're attacking the young particularly, because they're going to be the adult people as this cycle really unfolds.
[01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:39.697]  And therefore they need to destabilize them.
[01:19:39.957 --> 01:19:42.379]  And that's why their food and drink is attacked more than anyone else.
[01:19:42.399 --> 01:19:44.720]  And that's why we've got the kids being put on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.202]  David, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I'm only doing it with one segment today because time's precious.
[01:19:49.643 --> 01:19:53.285]  We're going to talk behind scenes for the PrisonPlanet.tv and internet listeners right now.
[01:19:53.305 --> 01:19:54.606]  Then come back to your calls after the break.
[01:19:54.626 --> 01:19:55.026]  Stay with us.
[01:19:56.173 --> 01:19:57.734]  Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break.
[01:19:57.774 --> 01:20:01.957]  David, we are just on the internet audience now because I promised to come back to calls.
[01:20:01.977 --> 01:20:04.359]  Let's put bookends on what you just said.
[01:20:04.839 --> 01:20:10.603]  I just read the other day in the New York Times, 100 million people on serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone.
[01:20:10.623 --> 01:20:14.946]  If that isn't THX1138 Brave New World, I don't know what is.
[01:20:17.168 --> 01:20:42.848]  I mean, they're attacking the police, the military, the citizens, all of us are in this together, and isn't that the great final illusion, is that people that work for the system feel like they're part of the elite, when even high-level elites are being poisoned by their own system, and that's why people say it's a spiritual thing, there's almost this cosmic force, and you get into that, but I just can see that it's there, driving man towards destroying themselves, and it's overall a hatred of the species.
[01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:50.676]  Yeah, the thing is, I say to people in uniform, you know, I say to them, you know, you've got no power.
[01:20:50.876 --> 01:20:53.819]  You know, there's some people that love the uniform because they think they've got power.
[01:20:53.839 --> 01:20:55.301]  And I say to them, you've got no power.
[01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:59.465]  Your power is what you put on in the morning when you open the wardrobe.
[01:20:59.949 --> 01:21:03.412]  The uniform you wear is an extension of the state.
[01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.774]  When you wear the uniform, you're an extension of the state.
[01:21:06.814 --> 01:21:09.416]  When you take the uniform off, you have no power.
[01:21:09.697 --> 01:21:11.738]  And the only power you have is of the state.
[01:21:12.018 --> 01:21:16.622]  You're just another pawn in the game while thinking you are higher than the other pawns that you're policing.
[01:21:16.982 --> 01:21:27.991]  And these are the levels of society, these polices of society, which Obama wants to massively increase with his networks of civilian security.
[01:21:28.859 --> 01:21:33.504]  These are the people that need to wake up and need to realize that they have children too.
[01:21:34.224 --> 01:21:49.599]  I know of one who's high in NATO who's just realized, he said he looked in the eyes of his four-year-old grandchild and said, I can't do this anymore because I know what I'm contributing to now and he's trying to get information out about what's going on.
[01:21:49.999 --> 01:21:51.481]  This is what we need to do.
[01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:56.612]  The police need to realize that they are the pawns also.
[01:21:56.632 --> 01:22:10.820]  Well, I was talking to a top doctor who's treated a head of state, and this head of state said, you know, I was grown up to, you know, that we have to exterminate 80% of people to keep the resources, but I look at people and I know it's evil and I don't want to be part of this.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.302]  I mean, a lot of people in the system are having an awakening too, aren't they?
[01:22:14.582 --> 01:22:14.922]  They are.
[01:22:15.822 --> 01:22:18.903]  There's so much to be optimistic about.
[01:22:19.003 --> 01:22:20.243]  I mean, the challenges are there.
[01:22:20.263 --> 01:22:20.883]  Of course they are.
[01:22:20.923 --> 01:22:21.823]  They want to push this on.
[01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:32.025]  And they want to push it on faster and faster now because they are desperately trying to stop this awakening manifest to such an extent that their house of cards comes down.
[01:22:32.446 --> 01:22:35.146]  So those challenges are there and they're going to push on through Obama.
[01:22:35.166 --> 01:22:44.108]  But there's so much to be enthusiastic and encouraged about because there is fantastic changes going on in the awareness of so many people.
[01:22:45.017 --> 01:22:53.987]  David, as you said though, in the one minute before we come back, quickly, I'd say Obama has two or three, four months when he first gets in till people wake up to that phase of the illusion.
[01:22:54.007 --> 01:22:57.712]  So they want to start a big war, a biological release or a financial collapse.
[01:22:58.372 --> 01:23:03.659]  What do we do to expose this guy and stop him being able to carry the ball for the New World Order in the first few months?
[01:23:04.349 --> 01:23:06.993]  Well, what we've got to do is keep whacking this information out.
[01:23:07.113 --> 01:23:12.342]  And people who are listening to this information, don't be a cul-de-sac for information.
[01:23:12.762 --> 01:23:15.547]  When you receive the information, there is a responsibility.
[01:23:15.607 --> 01:23:17.490]  Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on.
[01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:19.072]  By word of mouth, you can
[01:23:19.853 --> 01:23:23.694]  You can inform vast numbers of people very quickly if enough people do it.
[01:23:23.994 --> 01:23:25.055]  That's what we need to do.
[01:23:25.115 --> 01:23:30.656]  You're right, and we have incredible power, but we better use it now because they are planning to shut down the old web.
[01:23:30.696 --> 01:23:39.039]  The inventor of the web said a few days ago that it's going to die, they're letting it die, it's being killed, so we need to move right now.
[01:23:39.379 --> 01:23:46.001]  Folks, we're coming out of this break with OnlyPrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com exclusive screen listeners.
[01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:52.123]  tuning in, though we do have tens of thousands tuning in on the free streams and quite a few watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:52.143 --> 01:23:54.004]  We're coming out right now with David Icke with your calls.
[01:23:54.044 --> 01:23:54.445]  Here we go.
[01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:03.969]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:04.597 --> 01:24:07.619]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:08.479 --> 01:24:13.582]  The New World Order with its programmers admit that they're colonizing our minds, our souls.
[01:24:14.342 --> 01:24:19.004]  They are keeping us weak, confused, dumbed down, infighting.
[01:24:20.525 --> 01:24:21.766]  But the awakening is happening.
[01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:25.328]  David Icke, amazing guest, is our guest right now.
[01:24:25.668 --> 01:24:27.489]  DavidIcke.com is the website.
[01:24:27.509 --> 01:24:28.529]  We'll put that up on screen.
[01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:31.811]  Let's go to Ryan, first time caller from Georgia.
[01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:33.372]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[01:24:34.099 --> 01:24:35.540]  Yes, how you doing, Alex?
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:43.523]  First off, I just really want to tell you I'm very appreciative of this waking me up and informing me of all the information that's currently going on.
[01:24:44.403 --> 01:24:57.489]  And second, I just really wanted to say by far, I've been wanting to say this for a long time, Lindsey Williams, David Icke, Steve Quell, and Tex Mars are by far your most important guests that you have on your show.
[01:24:58.289 --> 01:25:03.111]  And I would just really appreciate if you can even get them on even more because every time they speak,
[01:25:04.373 --> 01:25:12.879]  They get really straight into the point and they inform us with information of how these people are thinking and pretty much what their next steps are.
[01:25:12.919 --> 01:25:16.001]  Hey, listen, I mean, I'd have David on every week or two if he'd do it.
[01:25:16.021 --> 01:25:20.244]  He's just very, very busy, but he has been agreeing to come on every month and a half or so.
[01:25:20.685 --> 01:25:22.646]  So I hope we can continue having David on, David.
[01:25:23.307 --> 01:25:24.527]  Yeah, well, that'd be great.
[01:25:24.547 --> 01:25:25.528]  Well, thanks very much, Ryan.
[01:25:25.968 --> 01:25:26.749]  Thanks very much for that.
[01:25:27.133 --> 01:25:29.935]  I'll give you an example of how things are moving on, though.
[01:25:30.776 --> 01:25:33.098]  I'm coming to America in about ten days.
[01:25:33.118 --> 01:25:34.819]  I'm going to be there for about two and a half months.
[01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:38.782]  I'm talking in Los Angeles on the 16th for seven hours, and then I'm going down to speak in Mexico.
[01:25:39.262 --> 01:25:41.904]  And after that, I'm going all over the world.
[01:25:42.445 --> 01:25:43.165]  I'm going to Greece.
[01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:44.106]  I'm going to Australia.
[01:25:44.206 --> 01:25:47.809]  I'm going to South America, to Brazil.
[01:25:47.949 --> 01:25:48.830]  I'm going to Croatia.
[01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.491]  I'm going to all these different places.
[01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:54.334]  And a few years ago, crikey, I couldn't fill a phone box in England.
[01:25:54.734 --> 01:25:55.175]  No, I don't.
[01:26:11.098 --> 01:26:15.240]  I've been to 47 countries now and it's happening all over the world.
[01:26:26.465 --> 01:26:27.426]  I'm going to set that up.
[01:26:27.466 --> 01:26:35.569]  I have to probably talk to you in the next few days so I can go ahead and decide on a venue and set it up and get you over here for maybe a two day event.
[01:26:35.889 --> 01:26:37.530]  The problem is getting a big enough venue.
[01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:38.891]  You can probably get 5,000 people.
[01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:39.431]  I can probably get 5,000.
[01:26:41.972 --> 01:26:43.273]  I need to find a time that's good for you.
[01:26:43.293 --> 01:26:46.435]  I need to nail that down and do that here in Austin, Texas.
[01:26:46.455 --> 01:26:47.696]  I think that's the place to do it.
[01:26:47.756 --> 01:26:49.097]  So I'll let that out of the bag.
[01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:53.319]  David's agreed to come here and speak with myself and he'll do his presentation.
[01:26:53.339 --> 01:26:56.241]  I'll do a briefer PowerPoint presentation.
[01:26:56.281 --> 01:27:01.184]  So that's coming up, the two of us teaming up, because we all have to come together during this critical time.
[01:27:01.244 --> 01:27:02.865]  I appreciate your call, Ryan.
[01:27:03.286 --> 01:27:05.287]  Anna in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:27:05.327 --> 01:27:05.747]  Go ahead.
[01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:08.489]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:27:08.789 --> 01:27:09.830]  Yes, Anna, you're on the air.
[01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.707]  I have to agree with the caller that was just on, Ryan.
[01:27:15.168 --> 01:27:19.490]  I love it when you have David Icke or Steve Quayle.
[01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:21.210]  I just wanted to say thank you.
[01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:22.111]  I'm a huge fan.
[01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:25.112]  I wish you could go on tour.
[01:27:25.132 --> 01:27:26.292]  I want to meet you in person.
[01:27:27.333 --> 01:27:28.833]  And that's all I wanted to say is thank you.
[01:27:29.173 --> 01:27:31.334]  Thank you to you and David and everything you do.
[01:27:31.835 --> 01:27:32.595]  Oh, thank you very much.
[01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:33.295]  What did I tell you?
[01:27:35.076 --> 01:27:35.716]  Absolutely.
[01:27:36.356 --> 01:27:39.438]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Montreal, Canada.
[01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:40.258]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[01:27:41.914 --> 01:27:42.194]  Yay!
[01:27:42.214 --> 01:27:43.015]  How's it going?
[01:27:43.615 --> 01:27:45.936]  I'm very happy to finally be able to speak to you both.
[01:27:45.956 --> 01:27:52.519]  I'm the webmaster of CriticalUnity.org and I syndicate a lot of both of your articles and videos on my site.
[01:27:53.239 --> 01:27:59.922]  As David mentioned, people need to take a good look at the big picture and not be intimidated by the elite's manipulation and scare tactics.
[01:28:00.502 --> 01:28:08.426]  The playing of the racial card is only possible because racism was indirectly created by the elites by molding our worldviews
[01:28:09.105 --> 01:28:13.547]  As fascism unfolds, those who supported Obama, or any of these bloodlines, they're waking up.
[01:28:14.228 --> 01:28:17.049]  And we will stand against the corruption no matter what they throw at us.
[01:28:17.449 --> 01:28:19.911]  Our world, our lives, and our freedoms are at stake here.
[01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:30.936]  Because the people have been at the mercy of the malevolent... Sorry, I'm a bit nervous, but... We've been at the mercy of these malevolent powers that have taken over our planet.
[01:28:31.957 --> 01:28:38.020]  The people are ready to hear the truth, but as long as the majority has no opportunity to even know about Infowars, DavidIke.com, or
[01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:40.295]  How will they wake up?
[01:28:40.855 --> 01:28:42.856]  Well, we're doing that now, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[01:28:42.896 --> 01:28:54.678]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating when I say, without even looking, I can spend 10-15 minutes on YouTube and count up videos that people are posting of my TV show or audio, and it's over a million a week just with that.
[01:28:55.078 --> 01:29:01.900]  You know, I've produced films that have been seen, what I can look on hit counters, a piece tens of millions of times on the web, and that now is the new medium.
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:06.041]  And people have made tens of millions of copies of the tens of thousands of videos I've shipped out.
[01:29:06.101 --> 01:29:07.021]  Same thing with David.
[01:29:07.541 --> 01:29:13.348]  So, look at the newspapers failing, look at mainstream media losing its ratings, while Alternative explodes.
[01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:15.911]  So, the word is getting out, isn't it David?
[01:29:16.632 --> 01:29:24.942]  It is, and we're heading towards a real explosion, because the curve in Awakening is getting really exponential.
[01:29:25.442 --> 01:29:26.503]  It's a collision course.
[01:29:26.523 --> 01:29:27.443]  Hold on, David.
[01:29:27.523 --> 01:29:30.244]  We're going to skip this one, too, in the time that we have.
[01:29:30.344 --> 01:29:32.445]  Just for Prison Planet, our TV viewers.
[01:29:32.465 --> 01:29:33.846]  For everybody else, we'll be right back.
[01:29:33.866 --> 01:29:34.266]  Stay with us.
[01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:36.847]  Okay, David, continue with what you were saying there.
[01:29:49.762 --> 01:30:02.869]  You know, the exponential curve is now heading straight upwards because as more and more people understand the basics of what is going on, they talk to more people and the whole thing expands.
[01:30:02.929 --> 01:30:08.191]  So you reach a point eventually when it's an explosion and we're absolutely on the cusp of that now.
[01:30:08.251 --> 01:30:10.232]  In fact, we're already beginning to see some of it.
[01:30:10.653 --> 01:30:12.854]  So, you know, this is a wonderful time.
[01:30:13.694 --> 01:30:15.395]  This is not a time to get depressed and
[01:30:15.775 --> 01:30:16.116]  Thank you.
[01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:43.477]  If you go to Google Trends and look at DavidIke.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Rents.com, all the hundreds of huge sites, my two are the biggest individually.
[01:30:43.537 --> 01:30:47.939]  Infowars is the largest alternative site, Prison Planet is the second largest, and there's Rents and Ike and others.
[01:30:49.339 --> 01:30:52.300]  If you look at them on the trends, it looks like this.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.241]  I want to zoom in on this on the PrisonPlanet.TV camera over here if we can.
[01:30:56.921 --> 01:31:03.262]  And this is basically what the trend looks from 2003 when they started Google Trends, tracking all the sites, to 2008.
[01:31:03.343 --> 01:31:05.903]  You can go pull these up on a Google Trends site.
[01:31:06.343 --> 01:31:07.884]  Anyone can look at this for themselves.
[01:31:08.304 --> 01:31:17.866]  And the curve, the growth curve, is exactly the same for all of these alternative media, consciousness expanding, you know, lie-breaking
[01:31:18.286 --> 01:31:21.668]  Websites, it is hyperbolic, it is straight up, David Icke.
[01:31:22.808 --> 01:31:38.996]  Yeah, so, you know, anyone that's sitting out there and is sort of frightened about doing anything or getting involved or the rest of it, you know, there are millions and millions and billions and millions of people gathering now all over the world.
[01:31:39.056 --> 01:31:47.900]  We just need to get together and deal with this because we're in a position now where we're heading to a time when we can.
[01:31:48.462 --> 01:31:52.885]  You know, I look back a few years and my goodness me, you thought, well, is anything going to change?
[01:31:52.945 --> 01:31:56.648]  But crikey, this is dreamland compared to where we were a few years ago.
[01:31:58.369 --> 01:31:59.670]  Well, just God bless you, David.
[01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:06.314]  And again, I've said this the last two times you've been on, but people still try to make hay out of it and you intelligently ignore it.
[01:32:07.916 --> 01:32:12.719]  They probably interviewed me for three hours off and on about you when a British crew was here for Channel 4.
[01:32:13.179 --> 01:32:16.602]  And the one little smart ass thing I said ended up being in the film.
[01:32:17.242 --> 01:32:34.761]  about you being a turd in the punch bowl because people weren't ready to accept some of the things you were saying and then I would have trouble with the basics and I've apologized for that but I'm going to do it again because you've been so big about it and for forgiving me and also because I know that information is used out there still by people to try to drive a wedge so I'll say it again.
[01:32:35.362 --> 01:32:35.963]  I apologize.
[01:32:37.164 --> 01:32:38.845]  No problem, Alex.
[01:32:39.505 --> 01:32:43.308]  We all have different opinions at different times, and they're not always correct.
[01:32:43.588 --> 01:32:44.529]  We all grow.
[01:32:45.389 --> 01:32:46.050]  Of course we do.
[01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:55.096]  And what we need to do is drop anything that divides us, any fault lines, any of this nonsense, because together we're going to sort this.
[01:32:55.196 --> 01:32:56.137]  Divided, we're not.
[01:32:56.482 --> 01:32:58.323]  Well, I think all of us that are awakening are right.
[01:32:58.403 --> 01:33:00.024]  It's just we've got different perspectives.
[01:33:00.385 --> 01:33:00.865]  Exactly.
[01:33:01.005 --> 01:33:03.406]  And then I've just had a chance to move and see things from different angles.
[01:33:03.987 --> 01:33:10.651]  Let's go ahead and, I mean, what's different from what you're saying about an evil overarching force behind it all with what Christians are saying?
[01:33:10.731 --> 01:33:12.412]  Really, again, it's all perspective.
[01:33:13.093 --> 01:33:14.814]  Let's go ahead and go back to the full transmission.
[01:33:16.413 --> 01:33:26.379]  Final segment with David Icke.
[01:33:26.719 --> 01:33:37.246]  Only have time to make a few final calls with him because I have some special information I'm going to be covering.
[01:33:38.386 --> 01:33:40.047]  Let's go ahead and jam in.
[01:33:41.966 --> 01:33:43.227]  Who is up next here, John?
[01:33:43.247 --> 01:33:44.388]  I got confused with the calls.
[01:33:44.688 --> 01:33:45.629]  Mark and P.A.?
[01:33:45.909 --> 01:33:46.790]  Oh, John in Canada.
[01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:49.372]  John in Canada, you're on the air with David Icke.
[01:33:50.293 --> 01:33:51.874]  How's it going there, Alex?
[01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:52.715]  Good, sir.
[01:33:53.676 --> 01:33:54.196]  Awesome.
[01:33:54.597 --> 01:34:01.923]  I just want to thank you guys very much for giving us an alternate source of international news right now, and I enjoy your show greatly.
[01:34:02.683 --> 01:34:09.749]  Alex, did you know that this last Christmas here in Canada was the first white one that we've had across the country since, like, 1974?
[01:34:11.795 --> 01:34:20.884]  Yes, global cooling is happening because the sun has the first time in 300 years of recording it no sunspots, which are the huge flares.
[01:34:21.444 --> 01:34:23.747]  And so the earth is rapidly cooling.
[01:34:25.023 --> 01:34:30.644]  This is another area, Alex and John, where Obama comes into play.
[01:34:31.144 --> 01:34:35.345]  It's another one of his solutions in the agenda behind him.
[01:34:36.346 --> 01:34:48.549]  People will have noticed that his, if you like, environmental, energy, science advisor network of people are all, if you like, worshippers of Al Gore's version of global warming.
[01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:54.290]  And you're going to see Barack Obama pushing forward policies, ludicrous policies, to
[01:34:55.711 --> 01:34:58.913]  Deal with a problem that's not actually caused by what they claim it is.
[01:35:01.414 --> 01:35:06.217]  Yeah, and we just missed the big carbon tax thing here with the last election.
[01:35:06.237 --> 01:35:08.339]  It was one of the main platforms for the Liberal Party.
[01:35:08.979 --> 01:35:21.808]  And I've talked to some people about the Liberal Party and how they're involved with, it's not just the Liberal Party now either, it's also the Conservatives who are involved with the Power Corporation of Canada, who in turn is also linked with the genocide in Sudan.
[01:35:23.152 --> 01:35:33.581]  Every Prime Minister we've had in Canada almost, since Trudeau, including Trudeau, has all been, like, on the board of directors for the Power Corporation of Canada.
[01:35:34.222 --> 01:35:40.367]  And Paul Volcker actually was on the International Advisory Committee as well.
[01:35:40.647 --> 01:35:43.910]  And you tell people this and they go, oh, that's just business.
[01:35:44.311 --> 01:35:45.752]  It's got nothing to do with politics.
[01:35:49.654 --> 01:35:53.358]  Business in terms of the Illuminati is control.
[01:35:53.418 --> 01:35:54.819]  I mean, that's what business is for.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:56.661]  They're just arms of control.
[01:35:57.021 --> 01:36:07.232]  This is why when I hear people of the left dismissing the global conspiracy and saying globalization is just greedy corporations, it's not greedy corporations.
[01:36:07.452 --> 01:36:09.174]  Corporations are a vehicle
[01:36:09.735 --> 01:36:10.595]  Hello, this is Mark.
[01:36:10.615 --> 01:36:11.335]  Hello, Mark.
[01:36:11.395 --> 01:36:12.015]  Hello.
[01:36:12.055 --> 01:36:16.376]  I want to thank both of you for opening my perceptions, as well as many others around the planet,
[01:36:39.943 --> 01:36:42.324]  To the truth of what is really happening.
[01:36:43.044 --> 01:36:49.706]  I'm pretty much a non-traditionalist, a non-conformist, but there are many out there who aren't.
[01:36:50.366 --> 01:36:55.707]  They're busy doing what they're doing.
[01:36:55.827 --> 01:36:58.428]  They want to believe in the good of government.
[01:36:58.448 --> 01:37:00.448]  They want to believe in the good of their community and all of this.
[01:37:01.068 --> 01:37:04.069]  The reality is these things are happening and they're not even aware of it.
[01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:06.950]  When I start to share these things, as well as others,
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:08.601]  I'm sure I'm not alone.
[01:37:09.021 --> 01:37:18.548]  When you share these ideas, these perceptions with people, at first they look at you like, oh, that can't be, and then they're in shock, and then they're like the deer in the headlights.
[01:37:19.088 --> 01:37:30.936]  So what comes up to me, and I appreciate very much that you guys are opening our perceptions to these things that are happening and continuing to investigate and research and find out what they're continuing to do, but here's the thing.
[01:37:31.516 --> 01:37:35.099]  When it comes down to it, people are in shock at first, and then
[01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:36.669]  They don't know what to do.
[01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:54.394]  So, and I've listened, I've watched your show, or listened to your show, Alex, many, many times, and I've read your materials, Mr. Ike, and the thing about it is when you boil it all down, people don't know what to do, like taking simple steps of what to do to respond.
[01:37:54.414 --> 01:37:54.855]  Alright, I hear you.
[01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.195]  We have to end this here in just a moment.
[01:37:56.215 --> 01:37:57.395]  I'm going to let you go, and I'm sorry.
[01:37:57.775 --> 01:38:02.597]  No more time to go to Tim, Rob, and many others that are holding, and I want David to be able to close out in the last minute here.
[01:38:03.657 --> 01:38:06.059]  Last time we had David on, the time before that, he went through.
[01:38:06.099 --> 01:38:07.680]  Just say no to national ID cards.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.921]  Say no to giving up your personal information.
[01:38:09.961 --> 01:38:11.002]  Start growing a garden.
[01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:13.784]  Start talking to your neighbors about the elite.
[01:38:13.844 --> 01:38:15.965]  The awakening is the solution.
[01:38:16.525 --> 01:38:18.266]  Overturning the false paradigm.
[01:38:18.567 --> 01:38:20.128]  Expanding the horizon.
[01:38:20.168 --> 01:38:20.468]  David?
[01:38:21.138 --> 01:38:35.056]  Yeah, once you break out of mind of the program and into consciousness, then you instinctively know what your contribution is and you go for it because when you become conscious, you let go of one of the great expressions of the mind construct, which is fear.
[01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.230]  What?
[01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:38.690]  What happened?
[01:39:08.192 --> 01:39:13.516]  What would happen if everybody wrote Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or DavidIke.com on all the paper money?
[01:39:13.856 --> 01:39:14.777]  That's already waking up.
[01:39:14.817 --> 01:39:16.718]  A lot of people coming to the site are because of people doing that.
[01:39:16.998 --> 01:39:21.401]  What would happen if people made copies of my films or handed out David Ike documentaries?
[01:39:21.661 --> 01:39:23.362]  Well, what is happening?
[01:39:23.402 --> 01:39:24.823]  We're seeing we're having an effect.
[01:39:25.103 --> 01:39:26.424]  We've just got to push that much harder.
[01:39:26.725 --> 01:39:27.725]  David, when's a good time?
[01:39:27.745 --> 01:39:30.767]  Because I forgot that I invited you to town and you agreed when we were on a month ago.
[01:39:31.168 --> 01:39:37.872]  When's a good time to call and talk to you and try to look at some calendars and figure out when it's good, say, four or five months in the future to get you to Austin, Texas?
[01:39:38.533 --> 01:39:40.717]  Okay, well, tomorrow's fine, or Monday's fine.
[01:39:40.777 --> 01:39:42.080]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:39:50.933 --> 01:39:52.634]  Well, David, we really appreciate your time.
[01:39:52.674 --> 01:39:53.575]  DavidIke.com.
[01:39:53.595 --> 01:39:54.576]  Folks, check it out there.
[01:39:54.616 --> 01:39:55.277]  Great materials.
[01:39:55.717 --> 01:39:57.278]  And we appreciate everything you're doing, David.
[01:39:57.819 --> 01:39:58.279]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:58.299 --> 01:39:58.739]  Same to you.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:39:59.440]  You bet.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:39:59.840]  Take care.
[01:40:01.001 --> 01:40:01.302]  Cheers.
[01:40:01.422 --> 01:40:07.026]  There goes David Ike from the United Kingdom, joining us for the last hour and 40 minutes.
[01:40:07.166 --> 01:40:07.427]  Okay.
[01:40:07.927 --> 01:40:09.148]  What is the surprise today?
[01:40:09.188 --> 01:40:12.791]  Well, it's not Alex Jones' Tyranny Crusher 1.
[01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:14.813]  This was the first time we ever did an eBay item.
[01:40:15.908 --> 01:40:19.795]  And the reason we did it is because people are like, well, this megaphone's broken, we've bought a new one.
[01:40:19.815 --> 01:40:21.057]  You've had this one for all these years.
[01:40:21.077 --> 01:40:23.621]  It's in the movie, A Scanner Darkly, that they rotoscoped.
[01:40:23.642 --> 01:40:24.864]  That's really me and the bullhorn in there.
[01:40:24.884 --> 01:40:26.807]  We're going to play a clip of that in a moment.
[01:40:29.301 --> 01:40:30.082]  This isn't a surprise.
[01:40:30.102 --> 01:40:30.943]  The surprise will come up in a minute.
[01:40:31.604 --> 01:40:33.726]  Tyranny Crusher 1, should we get it fixed?
[01:40:34.246 --> 01:40:36.309]  Like a $125 megaphone, or should we sell it?
[01:40:36.729 --> 01:40:38.091]  And obviously it's a fundraiser.
[01:40:38.111 --> 01:40:42.375]  We're not saying the megaphone, just as a megaphone, is worth $3,500.
[01:40:42.916 --> 01:40:45.138]  I think it's the latest bid on there for it.
[01:40:45.178 --> 01:40:45.699]  We opened it up at $1,500.
[01:40:47.489 --> 01:40:50.831]  There is Tyranny Crusher 1 on the presentplanet.tv screen.
[01:40:51.372 --> 01:40:56.615]  This is, and I saw disinfo shills on the comments on that article going, how dare you try to make money!
[01:40:57.295 --> 01:41:09.763]  Again, when the establishment taxes our money and uses it against us, I'm not supposed to try to fund things so I have a good mic to get the voice out there well, to give you a good, you know, show of information, to have these guests on, to have a producer to schedule it, to have, I mean, it's asinine!
[01:41:10.384 --> 01:41:15.007]  And so because the establishment's criticizing me for trying to fund this operation,
[01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:19.263]  Which is like a pea shooter against their propaganda, but having a great effect.
[01:41:19.604 --> 01:41:20.024]  You know what?
[01:41:20.464 --> 01:41:23.206]  Just because of you establishment folks, go ahead and send me checks.
[01:41:23.647 --> 01:41:26.509]  You want to donate $100, $1,000, $5, whatever.
[01:41:26.869 --> 01:41:30.912]  You have my word that 95% of that money that comes in here will be used.
[01:41:30.932 --> 01:41:32.514]  The other 5% for me to live and you know.
[01:41:33.234 --> 01:41:36.475]  Wear this on TV so it goes across well to folks and all the rest of it.
[01:41:36.996 --> 01:41:38.816]  Because it's my whole passion.
[01:41:39.517 --> 01:41:44.959]  As if we can't have a political or sociological passion and then fund our operation, or we can't sell our books.
[01:41:44.979 --> 01:41:50.562]  But everybody else in the establishment, they can sell their books and get ten million dollars a year to read off a teleprompter on the nightly news.
[01:41:51.722 --> 01:41:53.743]  There's no teleprompter here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:53.763 --> 01:41:58.585]  This is my heart and soul and my intellect and my research and the guests we bring you here and all the people we build up.
[01:41:59.025 --> 01:41:59.946]  So, you know what?
[01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:03.997]  I want to see $50,000 bid for Tyranny Crusher 1.
[01:42:05.078 --> 01:42:08.540]  I know we've got some big donors out there.
[01:42:09.401 --> 01:42:11.683]  I'll use 100% of Tyranny Crusher 1's money.
[01:42:12.503 --> 01:42:18.107]  100% of Tyranny Crusher 1's money, because we spent over $100,000 on this little studio, and folks, that's cheap.
[01:42:18.127 --> 01:42:19.308]  They're like, well, that's expensive.
[01:42:19.649 --> 01:42:21.430]  We have the cheapest switcher they make that's new.
[01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:23.792]  Twenty-something grand, and the cameras and all of it.
[01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.354]  We're trying to really develop and expand this.
[01:42:26.394 --> 01:42:28.396]  It's having a huge effect now with just this new look.
[01:42:28.656 --> 01:42:29.697]  It's not even that fancy.
[01:42:30.037 --> 01:42:34.541]  Instead of the videos on YouTube, each one every day getting 10,000 views a day, it's like 60, 70, 100,000 views per day.
[01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:36.463]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[01:42:36.903 --> 01:42:38.064]  All because of presentation.
[01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:50.035]  I'm going to have professional lighting people and folks come in with just a basic two-camera shoot for a news program separate from this, but I looked at the books, even after the money bomb, and moving into this new office, we don't even have the money for that.
[01:42:50.755 --> 01:42:52.216]  So, it comes down to that.
[01:42:52.317 --> 01:43:01.685]  So, all those COINTELPRO that are so angry, or people that are just jealous of the work we're doing, don't understand this is life and death, go in there and let's bid Tyranny Crusher 1 up all the way.
[01:43:03.174 --> 01:43:08.738]  Let's get it done, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a fundraiser for free speech and what we're doing here.
[01:43:08.758 --> 01:43:10.018]  Let's see how high it'll go.
[01:43:10.078 --> 01:43:11.379]  It closes out next Wednesday.
[01:43:11.399 --> 01:43:17.903]  Let's go ahead and play a clip from Scanner Darkly where you see Tyranny Crusher 1 and Alex Jones.
[01:43:18.144 --> 01:43:21.366]  When we post this video, people put links up saying I'm making it up.
[01:43:21.406 --> 01:43:23.227]  I'm not even in Scanner Darkly or Waking Life.
[01:43:23.627 --> 01:43:26.449]  Folks, that's COINTELPRO on the site saying I wasn't in Scanner Darkly.
[01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:29.911]  I don't talk about it that much, so I guess they just can't believe it.
[01:43:31.152 --> 01:43:35.875]  Or that a film I'm in this year is the top selection at South by Southwest, but I'll leave that as a side issue.
[01:43:36.996 --> 01:43:40.738]  And coming up at, what's the one up in Utah, that big one?
[01:43:41.118 --> 01:43:41.579]  Side issue.
[01:43:41.599 --> 01:43:44.000]  The point is we're having huge effects, and that's what we should.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:45.261]  We should be ready for success.
[01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:46.162]  We should be ready for victory.
[01:43:46.382 --> 01:43:47.883]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from A Scanner Darkly.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:50.781]  Where did Substance D come from?
[01:43:51.081 --> 01:43:52.261]  Why can't we stop it?
[01:43:52.661 --> 01:43:58.223]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose, the more Substance D is on our streets!
[01:43:58.743 --> 01:44:00.004]  Can't you figure this out?
[01:44:00.324 --> 01:44:01.304]  Look around you!
[01:44:01.604 --> 01:44:02.865]  Look how far we've come!
[01:44:03.125 --> 01:44:05.746]  Humanity wasn't meant to live like this!
[01:44:05.926 --> 01:44:09.367]  Our every waking moment tracked and traced and scanned!
[01:44:09.627 --> 01:44:11.808]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[01:44:11.988 --> 01:44:14.109]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[01:44:15.069 --> 01:44:15.349]  Uh-oh!
[01:44:15.509 --> 01:44:17.491]  Hey guys, I used to be one of you!
[01:44:17.511 --> 01:44:19.272]  Stop selling out your own species!
[01:44:37.153 --> 01:44:37.553]  You scared me.
[01:44:48.154 --> 01:44:50.637]  This is a piece of memorabilia, the only piece I've ever sold.
[01:44:51.478 --> 01:44:53.219]  My most used bullhorn, it's in that film.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.564]  It got the line cut in Denver when they attacked us, MSNBC employees.
[01:44:57.904 --> 01:45:00.687]  That's Tyranny Crusher 1, up at eBay, story at Infowars.com.
[01:45:01.028 --> 01:45:04.311]  Now here's a piece of memorabilia that I will never sell.
[01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:09.276]  I told you I had this, and I had people laugh at me and say I didn't.
[01:45:09.376 --> 01:45:10.578]  Charlie Sheen gave me this.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.141]  And this is on the cover.
[01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:15.863]  In fact, bring me that video DVD cover, please.
[01:45:16.723 --> 01:45:17.624]  He told me to share it with folks.
[01:45:17.664 --> 01:45:19.325]  I said, what should I do with it?
[01:45:19.365 --> 01:45:23.087]  He said, oh, frame it in your house or show it to your friends, whatever, because you're the real Wolverine.
[01:45:23.968 --> 01:45:26.329]  And he was 14, I guess, when he did that movie, or 15.
[01:45:26.890 --> 01:45:30.212]  And this is the letter jackets they gave them all in Red Dawn.
[01:45:30.232 --> 01:45:32.033]  You can see it on the cover.
[01:45:32.093 --> 01:45:33.394]  There's Charlie Sheen down on the corner.
[01:45:33.434 --> 01:45:36.356]  You can see the C of the letter jacket in that.
[01:45:37.216 --> 01:45:43.798]  And this is the original Wolverine jacket he wore in the film, and then he wore it after that in high school, so it's uh, torn up a bit.
[01:45:44.298 --> 01:45:49.920]  And I said, how in the world did you give me a piece of, remember, this is his first big movie, this is... I said, this is worth a lot of money.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.981]  He said, don't worry about that Alex, you know, this is because you're the real Wolverine.
[01:45:53.061 --> 01:45:54.202]  That's how cool Charlie is.
[01:45:55.142 --> 01:45:55.442]  Look at this.
[01:45:58.373 --> 01:45:59.073]  Isn't that cool?
[01:45:59.093 --> 01:46:02.176]  And I've been so busy, I've got to get around to framing it.
[01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:04.597]  You know, I'll do a Hard Rock Cafe or whatever in my house or something.
[01:46:04.837 --> 01:46:06.438]  But I mean, because I always loved that movie.
[01:46:06.458 --> 01:46:10.501]  I'll never remember, I came down to visit my grandparents in Austin with my dad and mom.
[01:46:10.541 --> 01:46:12.382]  And my dad said, come on, let's go see a movie.
[01:46:12.402 --> 01:46:13.563]  We went and saw Red Dawn.
[01:46:14.064 --> 01:46:15.945]  And I was just totally blown away by it.
[01:46:16.485 --> 01:46:17.327]  And Charlie Sheen.
[01:46:19.069 --> 01:46:20.812]  Just an amazing job acting in that film.
[01:46:21.213 --> 01:46:22.695]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:22.735 --> 01:46:25.800]  I've got some other mementos that big stars have given me without me asking.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:27.442]  I don't know why they give me stuff.
[01:46:27.583 --> 01:46:30.126]  Rick Linklater has given me stuff and other people have that I won't talk about.
[01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:33.487]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:33.807 --> 01:46:37.188]  And I thought I would show you this jacket from the film.
[01:46:37.228 --> 01:46:40.149]  In fact, let's cut to Jaron so people can see a wide shot of it.
[01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:46.871]  Let's get that camera aimed over there at Jaron so people can get a better view of it.
[01:46:47.432 --> 01:46:55.754]  And then after we do that, we are going to go ahead and go to a clip from Red Dawn where you see the jacket that's worn throughout the movie.
[01:46:55.774 --> 01:46:56.974]  There's quite a few scenes.
[01:46:57.014 --> 01:46:58.975]  Go ahead and flip it around for them, Jaron.
[01:47:01.485 --> 01:47:01.745]  I don't know.
[01:47:01.765 --> 01:47:03.307]  I mean, I forget I've got stuff like this.
[01:47:03.367 --> 01:47:04.087]  It's just so cool.
[01:47:04.588 --> 01:47:04.968]  Okay.
[01:47:05.789 --> 01:47:08.351]  I can't think of a cooler piece of movie memorabilia.
[01:47:09.732 --> 01:47:12.074]  I guess Darth Vader's Lifesaver or something like that.
[01:47:12.795 --> 01:47:17.219]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip from Red Dawn that came out in the early 1980s or mid-1980s.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:19.181]  Thanks for the ride.
[01:47:19.321 --> 01:47:19.741]  Okay.
[01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:20.682]  So what's the deal?
[01:47:20.702 --> 01:47:21.002]  Get going.
[01:47:21.022 --> 01:47:21.783]  You don't have time for breakfast.
[01:47:22.684 --> 01:47:23.905]  Are you working or what?
[01:47:24.345 --> 01:47:27.328]  Yeah, I'll be at the station all day, so you're going to have to hitch a ride home.
[01:47:27.628 --> 01:47:28.269]  You got practice today?
[01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:30.930]  After that, man, we're at double time.
[01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:31.730]  Triple.
[01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:33.230]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:34.211]  You'd think they'd take it down.
[01:47:34.611 --> 01:47:35.291]  Oh, come on, bud.
[01:47:35.651 --> 01:47:37.251]  You lost a football game once yourself.
[01:47:38.172 --> 01:47:38.472]  What?
[01:47:39.332 --> 01:47:39.832]  I don't remember.
[01:47:40.252 --> 01:47:40.552]  I do.
[01:47:42.273 --> 01:47:42.853]  I think you're lying.
[01:47:43.813 --> 01:47:45.474]  Yeah, I'm having a wind of bleed your mouth.
[01:47:45.594 --> 01:47:45.954]  Later, bud.
[01:47:46.214 --> 01:47:52.015]  See you, Jed.
[01:47:54.517 --> 01:47:55.438]  So, did you do your history?
[01:47:55.598 --> 01:47:55.898]  Yeah.
[01:47:56.298 --> 01:47:56.699]  Some of it.
[01:47:57.519 --> 01:48:02.443]  Now, the great hunt out in a semi-circle, I would say about the size of Rhode Island.
[01:48:03.363 --> 01:48:07.406]  Then they would ride forward, driving everything before them.
[01:48:08.787 --> 01:48:12.650]  Beasts, men, even bugs.
[01:48:14.872 --> 01:48:18.574]  Now, the ends would kind of close in to form a shrinking circle.
[01:48:18.735 --> 01:48:23.298]  That's what's happening in, uh... That's what's happening in Israel right now with the...
[01:48:24.332 --> 01:48:24.853]  Same deal.
[01:48:31.038 --> 01:48:32.400]  Oh, he tackles him in the jacket!
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:33.701]  Tackle the Ruski!
[01:48:34.201 --> 01:48:38.045]  By the way, I'm on Russia Today during Election Day coverage.
[01:48:38.765 --> 01:48:39.486]  For a full hour.
[01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:48.755]  And of course,
[01:48:49.952 --> 01:48:52.014]  Red Dawn is the favorite film of the militias.
[01:48:52.634 --> 01:48:54.316]  And now I have the jacket.
[01:48:54.776 --> 01:48:56.737]  Wolverines!
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:00.500]  It's fun.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:01.401]  I mean, we're in danger.
[01:49:01.421 --> 01:49:02.742]  A lot of us will get killed in this fight.
[01:49:03.183 --> 01:49:05.284]  But at least I get to meet cool people like Charlie Sheen.
[01:49:06.185 --> 01:49:08.567]  And there he is handing the .357 to his brother.
[01:49:08.867 --> 01:49:10.088]  The evil Second Amendment.
[01:49:10.268 --> 01:49:11.529]  Look at those rifles in the car.
[01:49:12.110 --> 01:49:13.771]  They just absolutely hate the Liberty.
[01:49:15.392 --> 01:49:16.033]  It's fun.
[01:49:16.954 --> 01:49:18.155]  It's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:19.212 --> 01:49:25.134]  But that is a piece of memorabilia I will never sell, unless I guess my children are starving, and at that point there probably won't even be an eBay.
[01:49:25.294 --> 01:49:26.715]  Imagine how much that sucker would fetch.
[01:49:26.735 --> 01:49:27.495]  But you know what?
[01:49:28.096 --> 01:49:30.537]  Again, that's just how classy Charlie Sheen is.
[01:49:31.297 --> 01:49:35.959]  And he gives his friends people he really likes, things like that, and I'm just so honored to ever be involved in his life.
[01:49:36.359 --> 01:49:41.061]  That's why the system has tried to demonize him and attack him, and he was told, shut up, about 9-11 truth, that they'd destroy him.
[01:49:41.761 --> 01:49:43.883]  They tried to in the media, but it was unsuccessful.
[01:49:43.963 --> 01:49:44.503]  One more look.
[01:49:44.523 --> 01:49:45.684]  People will probably never see it again.
[01:49:46.185 --> 01:49:47.266]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:48.266 --> 01:49:51.129]  The famous jacket from the movie on the Red Dawn cover.
[01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:57.614]  The Wolverine jacket that now I, Wolverine One, own.
[01:49:58.955 --> 01:50:00.216]  What a strange life, man.
[01:50:00.597 --> 01:50:01.878]  Fighting tyrannies had its rewards.
[01:50:01.958 --> 01:50:02.698]  It's also had its...
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:09.403]  It's punishments, but at the same time, overall, it's good to be involved in liberty and freedom and fighting corruption.
[01:50:09.623 --> 01:50:14.386]  And I get to associate with all those that love freedom, love humanity, that have honor, that have courage.
[01:50:14.746 --> 01:50:22.270]  All of you that are into evil, you get to associate it with backbiting, backstabbing, lying, delusional abuse of scum, and the stench of death in New World Order.
[01:50:23.010 --> 01:50:25.231]  And I get to be around the heroes that care about freedom.
[01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:28.051]  And that's why I've got to step up to the plate and be the best I can.
[01:50:28.712 --> 01:50:31.973]  And be the most honest and focused and most well-researched I can.
[01:50:31.993 --> 01:50:35.013]  And that's why I work at least 18 hours a day in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:50:35.233 --> 01:50:37.114]  Because you only get one shot at this in life.
[01:50:37.434 --> 01:50:38.574]  And I want to be on the good team.
[01:50:38.734 --> 01:50:39.775]  And I want to be victorious.
[01:50:40.015 --> 01:50:41.215]  And all the glory goes to God.
[01:50:41.755 --> 01:50:42.355]  All right, folks.
[01:50:42.816 --> 01:50:47.137]  We'll be right back in the final segment of this amazing 8th day of January 2009.
[01:50:47.177 --> 01:50:49.197]  Infowars.com and get the Bullhorn at eBay.
[01:50:52.267 --> 01:50:53.468]  Tyranny Crusher won!
[01:50:54.829 --> 01:50:55.389]  Yeah!

[01:51:21.429 --> 01:51:23.550]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:24.050]  this fall?

[01:54:06.128 --> 01:54:07.649]  Wolverines, baby!
[01:54:07.829 --> 01:54:08.229]  Ha ha!
[01:54:08.249 --> 01:54:08.769]  Yeah!
[01:54:09.049 --> 01:54:15.831]  You know, I'm not going to show you Charlie's note that came with it.
[01:54:16.931 --> 01:54:17.671]  I guess that's private.
[01:54:19.215 --> 01:54:20.878]  But, uh, I'm done talking about that.
[01:54:21.199 --> 01:54:22.080]  Want to rebroadcast?
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:30.355]  It's coming up on the InfoWars.com streams and we'll post this last two hours of video up at PrisonPlanet.tv for members when the show ends at T-minus four and a half minutes.
[01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:32.278]  But, uh...
[01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:43.721]  In closing, again, we're trying to fund this operation, and the reason we're able to expand or maintain, I'm kind of wondering if we can expand or just maintain with the economy the way it is, we need more funds.
[01:54:44.282 --> 01:54:47.106]  And I hope you will get the books and videos and materials, and also support our sponsors.
[01:54:47.166 --> 01:54:49.629]  And one of them is the place I buy precious metals.
[01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:57.072]  And Ted has still got gold at $60, $70, some of the pieces $80 under the price it's selling for.
[01:54:57.132 --> 01:55:01.593]  Gold is up right now, right at $15 today from yesterday.
[01:55:02.013 --> 01:55:05.154]  And you heard Dr. Paul Craig Roberts say we will have a depression worse.
[01:55:05.194 --> 01:55:06.994]  He never talked like that, the father of ergonomics.
[01:55:07.234 --> 01:55:08.254]  So I wanted to bring Ted on.
[01:55:08.535 --> 01:55:09.495]  Ted Anderson here at the end.
[01:55:09.515 --> 01:55:10.535]  He hasn't been on in about a week.
[01:55:11.235 --> 01:55:13.576]  Ted, you've got the super deal for people.
[01:55:13.616 --> 01:55:14.416]  Tell folks about it.
[01:55:14.796 --> 01:55:15.076]  I did.
[01:55:15.116 --> 01:55:18.639]  I was able to even back down a little bit on the British Sovereigns and Franks right now.
[01:55:18.659 --> 01:55:22.363]  I've got the French Frank at $2.04 and the British Sovereign at $2.52.
[01:55:23.644 --> 01:55:25.605]  So where is that price in the market?
[01:55:25.926 --> 01:55:26.506]  Like $7.60?
[01:55:26.646 --> 01:55:35.174]  Yeah, comparatively speaking, I did a little check on it and I was looking to see where I'd be at if I was going to do it at today's current spot prices.
[01:55:35.694 --> 01:55:40.558]  And the Frank comes in closer to $2.14 and the British Sovereign comes much closer to $2.70.
[01:55:42.034 --> 01:55:44.356]  And then I also have the buffaloes.
[01:55:44.776 --> 01:55:46.337]  And again, I'll put 50 more out there.
[01:55:46.377 --> 01:55:52.822]  The bottom line on those is they're real hard to buy and I don't want to be selling something I can't deliver real quick.
[01:55:52.902 --> 01:55:58.506]  So the gold buffalo, we have those right now at $1,036, which is actually the same price when gold was lower.
[01:55:59.476 --> 01:56:03.980]  I'm just, you know, I get them to trickle in here and I'm able to get a little bit of supply and I'll let 50 of them go.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.381]  So tell folks the coins you've got.
[01:56:05.401 --> 01:56:10.685]  You've got 50 Buffalos, impossible to get in most places, are huge premiums, no premium on it.
[01:56:10.705 --> 01:56:11.026]  50 of those.
[01:56:11.066 --> 01:56:12.967]  You've got a lot of Sovereigns and Franks, though.
[01:56:13.287 --> 01:56:13.888]  Yes, we do.
[01:56:13.948 --> 01:56:16.030]  That's the thing that I can get in your hands real fast.
[01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:17.631]  What about the Silver Half Dollars?
[01:56:17.751 --> 01:56:19.653]  Yeah, definitely the Silver Half Dollars.
[01:56:19.673 --> 01:56:20.713]  There's no question about it.
[01:56:20.733 --> 01:56:23.516]  They're at 840 or 168 per roll, a 20.
[01:56:24.036 --> 01:56:27.559]  And the reason why they're such a good idea, because if we do have a depression,
[01:56:27.995 --> 01:56:30.536]  You're going to have to buy things like groceries.
[01:56:31.057 --> 01:56:33.838]  And to have a big old gold piece may be too much money.
[01:56:34.339 --> 01:56:35.619]  And so you get into the silver.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.981]  Besides that, silver is a much tighter supply.
[01:56:38.021 --> 01:56:39.542]  These are gorgeous, great coins.
[01:56:40.382 --> 01:56:41.443]  What's the price on those?
[01:56:41.543 --> 01:56:45.505]  They're currently, right now, again, they're at $168 per roll of 20.
[01:56:46.006 --> 01:56:47.306]  And Alex, you need to have silver.
[01:56:47.486 --> 01:56:48.507]  I mean, you really do.
[01:56:48.547 --> 01:56:49.688]  How much is that per unit?
[01:56:50.668 --> 01:56:51.629]  Down to $8.40.
[01:56:51.849 --> 01:56:54.732]  So that's an amazing deal with silver up as well.
[01:56:54.752 --> 01:56:55.272]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:56.693 --> 01:56:59.736]  The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[01:56:59.776 --> 01:57:01.517]  And does that deal hold through until tomorrow, Ted?
[01:57:01.837 --> 01:57:02.558]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:02.578 --> 01:57:04.199]  We'll hold it through midnight tonight.
[01:57:04.239 --> 01:57:06.281]  And if the market's still strong, we'll do it tomorrow, too.
[01:57:06.941 --> 01:57:07.241]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:07.562 --> 01:57:15.127]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, it's on screen right now.
[01:57:15.147 --> 01:57:15.907]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:16.168 --> 01:57:17.549]  Like the old cartoons, Bouncing Ball.
[01:57:17.569 --> 01:57:18.389]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:22.012]  I mean, it is right there.
[01:57:22.552 --> 01:57:24.313]  And I want to know where to go, Deb.
[01:57:24.513 --> 01:57:29.937]  Do we have time at the very end of the show to go out with Ted's theme music and John will suspend his theme music?
[01:57:30.277 --> 01:57:31.358]  Yeah, get that ready for the last 45 seconds.
[01:57:32.719 --> 01:57:33.860]  Ted, I want to commend you.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.540]  People cannot beat those deals.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.461]  That is a steal anywhere in the market.
[01:57:37.501 --> 01:57:39.602]  And still, most brokers can't get gold and silver.
[01:57:39.662 --> 01:57:41.383]  They're selling one coin at a time.
[01:57:42.043 --> 01:57:44.044]  You've been in this business 30 years.
[01:57:44.064 --> 01:57:45.505]  You're able to pass these savings along.
[01:57:45.865 --> 01:57:49.567]  Is that $70 or $80 under what the market is selling these for?
[01:57:49.587 --> 01:57:53.069]  Well, I mean, because the gold is up another $10, I guess it's closer to $80.
[01:57:53.549 --> 01:57:57.771]  And you know, the other thing, too, we're selling those creature books with the silver dollar way below cost.
[01:57:58.993 --> 01:58:04.936]  Got a $25 book with a $20-something silver dollar that are going for premiums with the $6 shipping for what?
[01:58:05.076 --> 01:58:05.416]  How much?
[01:58:06.056 --> 01:58:05.416]  $26.45.
[01:58:06.116 --> 01:58:09.698]  So that's $20-something bucks under what it cost you?
[01:58:10.058 --> 01:58:10.598]  Yeah, it is.
[01:58:10.678 --> 01:58:11.178]  It really is.
[01:58:11.258 --> 01:58:14.860]  And people are buying the books and keeping the silver dollars and passing them on to people.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.101]  I can't think of a better way to spread the word.
[01:58:17.141 --> 01:58:19.062]  And Ted just does this for our audience.
[01:58:19.082 --> 01:58:19.382]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:21.663 --> 01:58:24.984]  Hold on, that's my Starship Troopers music.
[01:58:25.284 --> 01:58:26.485]  John's got to cut that off.
[01:58:27.305 --> 01:58:28.486]  Where the gold at?
[01:58:28.946 --> 01:58:30.888]  I want to know where the gold at?
[01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:33.289]  I want to know.
[01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:34.450]  I want to know.
[01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:35.651]  I want to know.
[01:58:35.851 --> 01:58:36.812]  God bless you all.
[01:58:36.832 --> 01:58:37.552]  Take care.
[01:58:37.572 --> 01:58:38.793]  Rebroadcast starts now.
[01:58:38.813 --> 01:58:40.174]  Rebroadcast starts now.
[01:58:40.234 --> 01:58:41.155]  God bless you all.
[01:58:44.897 --> 01:58:45.518]  Good job, John.
[01:58:45.558 --> 01:58:45.878]  I'll see you.
[01:58:45.898 --> 01:58:51.802]  Unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:52.163 --> 01:58:53.864]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:54.798 --> 01:58:55.839]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:56.339 --> 01:58:56.840]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:58.141]  This is his M.O.
[01:58:58.161 --> 01:58:59.442]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:59.502 --> 01:59:01.163]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:01.503 --> 01:59:08.269]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:08.649 --> 01:59:09.089]  Some U.S.
[01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:14.794]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:15.474 --> 01:59:18.939]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
