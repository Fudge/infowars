[00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:07.382]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:27.327]  Alright, for the last hour and 52 minutes of this live radio show today, we are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv with the video clips, a live feed of the show, and a lot more.
[00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.499]  We're taking lots of your phone calls.
[00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.202]  1-800-259-9231 gets you up and on the air.
[00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:57.793]  Got a news blitz coming up as well and some breaking news dealing with all these federal, secret federal reports that have been sent to us and others that are being leaked out by well-meaning police officers and military people trying to expose this tyranny, but the media is hyping it and using it, these leaks, to their own ends to create a chilling effect against free speech.
[00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:00.935]  Some new big developments on that front coming up.
[00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:02.436]  But right now your phone calls.
[00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:04.017]  Another call from Illinois.
[00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.438]  Steve in Chicago.
[00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:06.779]  You're on the air, Steve.
[00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:08.219]  It rains, it pours.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.220]  Alex, a couple of sides.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.322]  Number one, did you see the article that Germany banned Amano A10 corn from Monsanto?
[00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:19.903]  Yes, I have Der Spiegel here.
[00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:25.765]  Germany bans cultivation of GM corn because the studies we covered three years ago from China, Japan,
[00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:38.069]  India, Germany, the UK, the BT corn grows its own pesticide inside the corn at thousands of times what the chemical normally occurs in the corn.
[00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.031]  The bees, unlike other species of insect, will still eat it.
[00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:46.013]  And then it's killing them, much less what's happening to the humans.
[00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:47.733]  And so that is some good news.
[00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:48.654]  Right.
[00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:55.016]  And the other thing is, well, Governor Blagojevich, he might be willing to come on your show.
[00:01:55.972 --> 00:02:02.075]  The reason why I called up was about Moron D's and Mark Popotak at the Screwball Poverty Law Center.
[00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:12.781]  You know, they don't talk anything about the four dead cops that preceded in San Francisco, well, Oakland, actually, that preceded these three deaths of the policemen in New York.
[00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:23.907]  It seems to me that anybody they define as like a terrorist can't be somebody like Mad Bomber, Harris, Bill Ayers, coupled with Ulrich Meinhof,
[00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:25.206]  I don't know.
[00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:49.419]  They don't just hype it up, they then try to connect it to me when the white supremacist was attacking me on websites.
[00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.461]  Morris Dees, within hours, fed that to the local papers.
[00:02:53.502 --> 00:03:01.426]  The police gave him access to the alleged cop killers' internet searches, hundreds of sites, CNN, Fox, it's all been released now.
[00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:08.451]  He goes to my site, attacks me, and Morris Dees wanted to then come out and say that basically I had him kill the cop.
[00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:16.195]  Uh, and now that's been, of course, repudiated and retracted in Raw Story, Daily Kosh, uh, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:20.537]  Uh, but is this not an example of how these people operate?
[00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:27.841]  Yes, and you know, they had the unmitigated call in, uh, Oakland to have an Uhuru movement.
[00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:30.416]  It's some kind of black liberation movement.
[00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:39.282]  And after this guy had killed the four cops, they went out and they honored this gangster that mowed down four policemen trying to do their job.
[00:03:39.623 --> 00:03:40.083]  I saw that.
[00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:46.668]  Can you imagine if the scumbag white supremacist would have gone out and honored this guy that shot the three cops?
[00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:47.909]  What big news that would be.
[00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.512]  But then in Oakland they honored the cop killer and the news is mom.
[00:03:51.552 --> 00:03:53.153]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:03:54.454 --> 00:03:55.655]  It's incredible, folks.
[00:03:56.595 --> 00:03:58.976]  Hi Alex, all my respect to who you are, what you do, and how you do it.
[00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:00.156]  In my book, you're 10 out of 10.
[00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:01.136]  Greatest guy ever.
[00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:34.227]  Well, you guys mentioned, you touched a little bit on the vitamin K shot, and I recently had a baby girl born here in Michigan, so I did quite extensive research if it's good or bad, because I knew about the vaccine, but my wife, she was like, well, vaccine is one thing, vitamin is a different thing.
[00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:37.048]  So I would like to share that information, which is very interesting.
[00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:41.510]  First of all, the vitamin K shot that is state mandate here in Michigan,
[00:04:42.094 --> 00:05:01.629]  I have three cancer-causing ingredients, and even if you read the manufacturer's explanation, they do clarify that sudden death is a normal consequence of taking the vitamin C. No, it's a huge shot of a vitamin, claiming it helps the baby's blood clot.
[00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.033]  I mean, the baby's born the way it's supposed to be, and it is associated with killing them.
[00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:09.917]  But I mean, look, they had five vaccines they tried to mandate 20 years ago.
[00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:10.838]  Now it's over 50.
[00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:12.740]  These companies come out with a new drug.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.223]  They lobby the government to say it's mandatory, when it's really not even the law.
[00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:17.565]  They just intimidate you into it.
[00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:22.871]  And then now they admit HPV, human papillomavirus, is killing all these women all over the world.
[00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:24.052]  Admittedly killing them.
[00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:25.714]  And they just go, that's the way it is.
[00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:27.656]  You know, some women are going to die.
[00:05:27.676 --> 00:05:28.176]  Go ahead.
[00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:41.018]  No, it already has been prohibited in Western Europe, the particular injection of vitamin K because it has aluminum, it has permachloride, and it has antifreeze.
[00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:44.379]  Antifreeze is the third preservative in the vaccine.
[00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.860]  It is a totally bad, toxic
[00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:48.926]  Oh, really?
[00:05:49.046 --> 00:05:53.910]  John, cue up CBS News saying that mercury is good for children's brains, because we have a crew here.
[00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.552]  I want them to hear this audio.
[00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:59.615]  Now understand, we have other clips where they say lead toys are good for children.
[00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:00.376]  I'm not kidding.
[00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.420]  This is the new world order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.741]  And yes, that's why the IQs have dropped by 20 points on average.
[00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:13.783]  They admit sodium fluoride brain damages you, the aluminum, the mercury.
[00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:19.165]  And this is what the UN wrote about, is how they would, with injections, give us chemical lobotomies.
[00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:25.747]  And so you give your children a series of chemical lobotomies, and that's why all they can do is watch television and hail government.
[00:06:26.047 --> 00:06:27.148]  It's because they're brain damaged.
[00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:33.351]  And, uh, the GMO foods killing most of the animals they tested on, and those lab rats, they don't care, they feed it to us.
[00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:36.573]  The human growth hormone in the milk, it's just all part of hell!
[00:06:37.354 --> 00:06:40.936]  And this is part of the eugenics operation of the New World Order, and people can't believe it!
[00:06:41.236 --> 00:06:43.537]  Can you believe they gave black men over 50 years syphilis?
[00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.778]  Can you believe they took 4,000 plus U.S.
[00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:48.960]  children, foster children, and radiated them to death, declassifying?
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.442]  Can you believe they took 500,000 women and forcibly sterilized them until the 1980s?
[00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.660]  Can you believe the UN's funded the forced sterilization worldwide?
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.441]  This is who they are.
[00:06:58.882 --> 00:07:02.984]  Here is CBS News saying mercury is good for children's brains.
[00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:06.045]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:09.627]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:12.269]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:15.050]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.492]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:27.092]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:33.978]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:41.384]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:46.522]  And those were government paid for studies in conjunction with the vaccine company.
[00:07:46.563 --> 00:07:52.068]  So, I'm called the conspiracy theorist because I say mercury is bad for you.
[00:07:53.029 --> 00:08:02.700]  When it's the most deadly heavy metal in the body, in every case, other heavy metals just create plaques and kill the cells they touch, the neurons.
[00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:06.087]  You can Google this at major universities.
[00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:12.301]  They have electron microscope videos of mercury in monkey brains, similar to humans.
[00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:16.795]  And what it does, other heavy metals just kill the cells they touch.
[00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:26.443]  Mercury causes an electrochemical storm and just blasts with literal explosions, electrochemical explosions, just keeps killing and killing and killing.
[00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:29.546]  So it's again a perfect chemical lobotomy here.
[00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:32.028]  You won't be able to understand a police state and a government.
[00:08:32.489 --> 00:08:36.512]  It's just like in the children's movie, I'll use another analogy, the black hole.
[00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:39.455]  They land on the big government research space station.
[00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.397]  They say, oh, everybody evacuated.
[00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:41.938]  They're not here.
[00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.060]  And then they notice there's these people walking around in these black suits.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.762]  And they go, oh, those are robots.
[00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:50.626]  No, they're lobotomized human android slaves.
[00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:51.286]  They're the crew.
[00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:52.828]  And that's the general public.
[00:08:52.888 --> 00:08:55.971]  You can't talk to them, because they've been hit with chemical weapons.
[00:08:57.813 --> 00:09:02.697]  And now they tell the chemical weapon victims, oh, the poison's good, mercury good for you.
[00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:07.422]  In fact, John, do you have the clip where they say lead toys are good for kids from MSNBC?
[00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:10.124]  Yeah, we can pull that up for folks.
[00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:18.151]  I mean, this is... See, but the horror of it is so huge that people can't believe it, you see.
[00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:23.256]  Here is mainstream news telling you poison is good for your children.
[00:09:23.988 --> 00:09:29.951]  About inflation, that's another interesting point, because a lot of people like to say, uh, scaremonger about China, right?
[00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.573]  A lot of politicians, and I know you talk about that issue all the time.
[00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:34.914]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:47.321]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency, or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them, or food that isn't poisonous, their costs of production are going to go up, and that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.942]  So, I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[00:09:49.962 --> 00:09:52.964]  They're keeping prices low, and they're keeping prices for mortgages low, too.
[00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:56.289]  Oh yeah, she needs that lead in the baby's toys.
[00:09:56.769 --> 00:09:58.730]  Okay, anything else, Steve?
[00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.832]  I mean, John in Michigan?
[00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:03.574]  I think the answer is you need more mercury shots.
[00:10:04.754 --> 00:10:07.296]  You know how to read drug inserts?
[00:10:07.696 --> 00:10:10.959]  You care about your newborn daughter and shots she's going to get?
[00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.180]  Are you some kind of crazy terrorist?
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:20.165]  I mean, you actually... When you ask a question, sir, the answer you get, oh, it's a state mandate, and that's the answer you get in the hospital.
[00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:22.086]  And a mandate is not a law.
[00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:23.206]  A mandate is not a law.
[00:10:23.366 --> 00:10:26.748]  I'm a fluoride head who's had a lot of injections.
[00:10:26.848 --> 00:10:27.508]  I can't think.
[00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:29.689]  I'm going to call the cops on you if you say no.
[00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:30.350]  What's the law?
[00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.071]  I'm going to call people with guns.
[00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:34.812]  Very interesting about the fluoride.
[00:10:34.912 --> 00:10:45.117]  I came from East Europe like 15 years ago and back in the times 1988, 1989 when the communism collapsed and basically there wasn't any infrastructure, any economy.
[00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:47.718]  There wasn't any food in the stores.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:11:03.131]  The only thing that was being readily available to all the children in the high schools and the primary schools was milk with strawberry flavor and fluoride in a very luxury packaging.
[00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:05.092]  Very, very fancy.
[00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:09.416]  It was so readily available that, I mean, back then, you know, obviously, you know,
[00:11:11.377 --> 00:11:15.141]  Listen, listen, it's a Pulitzer Prize winning book on World War II and Scherer in interviews
[00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:36.402]  Wrote about it as well, Risen Paul, Third Reich, but not in that book, in papers he wrote.
[00:11:36.742 --> 00:11:41.167]  The Germans picked it up from the Soviets to put fluoride in the water to make you passive.
[00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:43.290]  That's university studies, they did that back in the 20s.
[00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:48.796]  And yeah, you walk into the, uh, babies aren't us, it's big things of fluoride water.
[00:11:48.997 --> 00:11:52.441]  Your baby needs fluoride, and it's way above the normal levels.
[00:11:53.061 --> 00:11:55.863]  And they admit it gives the kids bone cancer and brain damages them.
[00:11:56.284 --> 00:12:00.847]  I mean, literally, they gotta savage the brains while they're growing so they'll be football fans.
[00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.407]  You worry.
[00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:03.509]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:06.071]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.292]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:12:08.613 --> 00:12:09.834]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:12:10.234 --> 00:12:13.436]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:12:13.837 --> 00:12:18.700]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.363]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:12:23.032 --> 00:12:24.353]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:12:24.693 --> 00:12:27.314]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:30.555]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:12:31.055 --> 00:12:39.238]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:12:39.698 --> 00:12:44.100]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.222]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:49.402]  Or if you're not online,
[00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:53.948]  Call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:12:54.368 --> 00:12:57.273]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:12:57.774 --> 00:12:59.797]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:06.278]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:06.758 --> 00:13:13.763]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:13:14.344 --> 00:13:20.508]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:22.769]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:25.311]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:36.359]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:36.979 --> 00:13:38.280]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.021]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:40.522 --> 00:13:46.746]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:56.833]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:58.456]  The people strike back!
[00:14:01.821 --> 00:14:03.783]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:08.632]  Yeah, I remember going to Margaret Sanger
[00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:31.519]  Kindergarten in Dallas.
[00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:33.060]  They had her statue out front.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.043]  She called black people subhuman weeds.
[00:16:37.784 --> 00:16:38.965]  She got awards from Hitler.
[00:16:38.985 --> 00:16:39.986]  Gave awards to Hitler.
[00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:41.587]  She's worshipped as a liberal feminist.
[00:16:43.228 --> 00:16:46.010]  If you're a real Nazi, you get worshipped by the media like Schwarzenegger.
[00:16:46.351 --> 00:16:47.892]  You know, he says he admires Hitler and Rolling Stone.
[00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:49.553]  Well, hell, ADL gives you awards.
[00:16:49.753 --> 00:16:50.594]  You fight Nazis?
[00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:51.715]  Well, you're called a Nazi.
[00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:55.018]  That's how it works, but I remember being at Margaret Sanger.
[00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:56.486]  I don't
[00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:18.463]  I don't know.
[00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:45.774]  They made a liberal joke out of it, and Dr. Strangelove, General Jack T. Ripper, laughs about it, but it's real.
[00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:48.516]  And then you said you grew up in Eastern Europe.
[00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:57.242]  What country specifically, because I know the Soviets, especially in the blocs they controlled, did put out the free government foods with fluoride, fortified to help you.
[00:17:57.262 --> 00:17:59.364]  Did you enjoy the strawberry milk?
[00:17:59.404 --> 00:18:01.065]  It obviously didn't brain damage you enough, though.
[00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:06.452]  Well, it probably did brain damage me a little bit, but not enough, I guess.
[00:18:06.492 --> 00:18:07.972]  They didn't complete their purpose.
[00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:09.673]  Now, I did grow up in Bulgaria.
[00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:19.259]  Bulgaria was the main satellite of, as you know, it was the main satellite of the Soviet Union, so we were handling some hardcore influence from the Soviet Union about everything.
[00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:24.982]  And people didn't question why they were giving the children delicious strawberry fluoride milk?
[00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:32.805]  At that time, everybody believed that that was definitely a good thing for your teeth and the government is taking care of you, and I was surprised.
[00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:38.310]  Even back then, I was probably 12 or 13 years old, and I was surprised.
[00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.673]  How could you not have food?
[00:18:40.973 --> 00:18:46.618]  Food's in the stores, and then you have those fancy fluoride, strawberry-flavored milks
[00:18:46.997 --> 00:18:48.357]  That were very tasty, actually.
[00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:52.838]  I mean, if you don't, you know, if you don't know what you're drinking, it's actually... Well, I mean, let me expand on that.
[00:18:52.878 --> 00:18:57.919]  You know, they've now proposed putting fluoride and statins in the water supply, forced medicating.
[00:18:57.959 --> 00:19:11.062]  And for people rolling their eyes out there, I mean, you can read mainstream university reports from the 20s, 30s, and 40s, and Pulitzer Prize-winning books about World War II, about them using fluoride in the Soviet Union and Germany to pacify people.
[00:19:11.482 --> 00:19:16.263]  I mean, folks, I know this is quite a revelation for you, but since the caller brings it up, this is real.
[00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.684]  And they just told you on the news that mercury is good for you.
[00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:22.225]  It's not good.
[00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:24.827]  Mercury and fluoride are not good for you.
[00:19:24.907 --> 00:19:25.747]  I promise you.
[00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:26.928]  Look into it.
[00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:31.951]  Now, soon they're rewriting the history books right now to say mercury is good, but don't listen to them.
[00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:34.612]  If you were to drink even a thimble of it, it would kill you.
[00:19:35.153 --> 00:19:36.053]  Please don't try it.
[00:19:36.113 --> 00:19:36.734]  It's not good.
[00:19:36.794 --> 00:19:37.274]  I promise.
[00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.995]  If you give your child a thimble of mercury, it will kill them.
[00:19:40.456 --> 00:19:42.057]  They will die a horrible death.
[00:19:42.997 --> 00:19:44.079]  It is not good for you.
[00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:47.503]  I know the media says it's nutritious, but it's not.
[00:19:47.683 --> 00:19:49.545]  I can't believe I've got to explain to the public.
[00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.188]  I get emails saying mercury is good for me.
[00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:55.792]  No, they don't sell it at Whole Foods, folks.
[00:19:55.892 --> 00:19:56.853]  It's not good.
[00:19:57.594 --> 00:20:00.838]  And we're conspiracy theorists because we're saying mercury isn't nutritious.
[00:20:01.929 --> 00:20:13.017]  Can I make a little resemblance between totally two different worlds, Bulgaria in East Europe under communism and the United States under democracy supposedly.
[00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:24.064]  Obviously it was absolutely the same thing because what you're saying I can absolutely resemble to it and I remember that I was probably in second grade and they were explaining that in the future
[00:20:24.608 --> 00:20:29.271]  There is going to be pills that you can take and your teeth will never go bad.
[00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:46.442]  So what you're telling me, what you remember from your childhood is the same thing that I remember in my childhood, which means that pretty much as you were saying sometimes previously, it is all a masquerade, all a theater, and basically it is the same agenda, just carried a little bit a different way.
[00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:53.807]  You know, as far as the eugenics and the fluoride and the mercury and all that.
[00:20:56.843 --> 00:20:58.024]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:20:58.064 --> 00:20:59.105]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:02.787]  That was a very interesting and very informative call right there.
[00:21:02.807 --> 00:21:08.411]  We've got one minute, so I'm going to come back, and we're going to race through Frank, Dino, Paul.
[00:21:08.451 --> 00:21:13.094]  I'm going to get a quick pop-in from the founder of Oath Keepers.
[00:21:13.254 --> 00:21:14.515]  And this is a very radical thing.
[00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.336]  Just like I'm saying, mercury's not good for your brain.
[00:21:17.517 --> 00:21:18.357]  Very radical.
[00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:19.578]  Government disagrees.
[00:21:19.598 --> 00:21:20.518]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:22.680]  This is the insane level we've now reached.
[00:21:25.794 --> 00:21:35.580]  They're getting the police and military to say they'll keep their oaths and not violate their oaths to confiscate guns, put us in FEMA camps, make us do forced labor, which is being proposed by the government.
[00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:39.162]  Now, again, this is being called very radical, though.
[00:21:39.703 --> 00:21:40.623]  Very radical.
[00:21:41.544 --> 00:21:43.465]  To have the military and police keep their oath.
[00:21:43.605 --> 00:21:45.927]  I mean, this is what they swear an oath to.
[00:21:46.147 --> 00:21:47.228]  It's very hardcore.
[00:21:47.268 --> 00:21:48.628]  So that's coming up.
[00:21:48.648 --> 00:21:49.089]  Stay with us.
[00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.011]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.471 --> 00:21:53.972]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.987 --> 00:21:57.749]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.171 --> 00:22:02.052]  Spring is here.
[00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:03.072]  Growing season.
[00:22:03.252 --> 00:22:05.233]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:06.855]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:07.835]  Think about it.
[00:22:08.135 --> 00:22:11.978]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:22:12.218 --> 00:22:15.700]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.601]  The country is running out of food.
[00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:20.383]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:22:20.703 --> 00:22:32.588]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.801]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:06.364]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:12.507]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:19.228]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:19.448 --> 00:23:21.349]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:23.889]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:34.851]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:37.148 --> 00:23:38.429]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:40.229]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:47.012]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:55.335]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:55.835 --> 00:23:56.995]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:57.415 --> 00:23:58.616]  The people strike back.
[00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:02.415]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:24:02.535 --> 00:24:09.237]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:24:09.517 --> 00:24:17.679]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:23.620]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.602]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:24:25.642 --> 00:24:27.824]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:24:27.844 --> 00:24:32.189]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:24:32.369 --> 00:24:34.491]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:24:34.592 --> 00:24:42.460]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:42.940]  We're good.
[00:25:06.733 --> 00:25:22.092]  Alright, Stuart Rhodes is our guest with a quick update and we're going to go right back to your phone calls and Judge Napolitano is going to be popping in on the transmission to talk about the tea parties and how the media is trying to balkanize it into left and right to divide and conquer the people.
[00:25:22.913 --> 00:25:34.162]  See, the Republicans are playing the out-of-party power right now, so they can act all revolutionary and against the bailout and the bankers when they helped engineer and architect the entire system, along with Obama's handler, Geithner.
[00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:48.173]  And then Obama can play the part of the establishment guy, and then four to eight years, they'll give us the Republicans again, the Democrats will play the part of the anti-establishment, and so the cycle goes on and on, suckering generation after generation into greater tyranny and slavery.
[00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:49.955]  Or we can wake up and go, wait!
[00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.236]  There's a puppet on the left, a puppet on the right.
[00:25:52.777 --> 00:25:54.478]  Wait, it's one guy holding both puppets.
[00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:56.100]  I don't like that guy.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.644]  I want to talk about the franchise owner, the shareholder of the power system.
[00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:06.388]  I want to talk about how the corporate welfare is 30 to 1, but the media all makes it about welfare moms.
[00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:08.510]  And then that's bad because it brings government control.
[00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:13.615]  You know, I'm against government health care because the government's run by eugenicists.
[00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:16.411]  And then they'll make you take the treatment they want.
[00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:17.412]  The history of government?
[00:26:17.772 --> 00:26:19.293]  Nazi Germany had government health care.
[00:26:19.994 --> 00:26:20.875]  Soviet Union did.
[00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:23.177]  They'd arrest you for criticizing them, say you were a lunatic.
[00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:24.458]  They're now trying to pass laws.
[00:26:24.678 --> 00:26:29.102]  I got articles here where they're saying all mothers are mentally ill when they have babies and need to be put on Prozac.
[00:26:30.011 --> 00:26:32.532]  They're trying to claim half the school kids are mentally only to be on drugs.
[00:26:32.952 --> 00:26:34.632]  This is about drugging and controlling.
[00:26:35.152 --> 00:26:39.033]  And not only do they get social control out of it, they then get to micromanage your life.
[00:26:39.093 --> 00:26:40.593]  Now, this is very exciting.
[00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:58.337]  Oath Keepers just started a few months ago, Stuart Rhodes, former Airborne Rangers in the Army, worked with the Ron Paul campaign at the highest levels, got upset about what was happening with the New World Order after the campaign ended, knew that things were intensifying, and he understood that tyranny will come to your door in a uniform.
[00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:13.513]  Throughout history, and so we can get to the police and military and show them how the Bill of Rights and Constitution is being violated, how the globalists are criminals, and how they're manipulating things, and that they should commit to follow their oath with these ten ten principles.
[00:27:14.713 --> 00:27:16.594]  That this would hamstring the New World Order.
[00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:27.600]  Now, the New World Order, the global corporate crime syndicate, this overall planetary system where they can commit their crimes and get away with it, because they control the courts and the systems, they understand that's their big threat.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:43.928]  That's why in these MIAC reports, that's why in these federal reports demonizing Christian conservative gun owners, the media is paying attention to those reports, but they also have reports, that's what's coming up later, that go after environmental activists, that go after the, quote, left wing.
[00:27:44.978 --> 00:27:50.401]  And so you have to understand, this was all being issued under Bush as well, and that's the big report I'm going to get into later.
[00:27:51.602 --> 00:28:07.372]  So, this is so important because when they say the number one threat to the government, the criminal government, the hijacked government, the counterfeit government, is returning troops, gun owners, people buying guns and ammo, saying we're terrorists.
[00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.874]  And this has finally gotten the people's attention.
[00:28:10.234 --> 00:28:12.555]  So, perfect timing with the first big
[00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:20.402]  Oath Keepers meeting coming up on the Green in Lexington, where it all started in 1775, April 19th, 1775.
[00:28:21.103 --> 00:28:24.026]  So, Stuart Rhodes, great to have you back, my friend.
[00:28:25.007 --> 00:28:25.929]  Honored to be back again.
[00:28:26.189 --> 00:28:26.749]  Thank you very much.
[00:28:27.438 --> 00:28:28.499]  You bet, Stewart.
[00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:30.820]  Give us your take.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:43.706]  I mean, this is the biggest news story out there right now, in and around the Tea Parties, is the media saying the Tea Parties are evil terrorists, who are basically cop killers, is what they're trying to say, and they're a bunch of right-wingers, when it isn't about left or right.
[00:28:43.946 --> 00:28:46.167]  They're desperate to divide the American people.
[00:28:46.427 --> 00:28:48.608]  Can you explain to folks what that military tactic is?
[00:28:49.989 --> 00:28:51.189]  Oh, sure, divide and conquer.
[00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.310]  Alex, well, they wanted to correct those.
[00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.291]  I was never a Ranger.
[00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:56.612]  I was a long-range reconnaissance scout.
[00:28:57.242 --> 00:29:01.006]  So I just want to make sure no one accuses me of falsifying records.
[00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:05.430]  You were in the Army and Special Forces, right?
[00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.714]  I was in the Army, I was a paratrooper, and I did long-range reconnaissance scouting.
[00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:11.976]  So you were in the Airborne?
[00:29:12.756 --> 00:29:13.577]  Yes, I was Airborne.
[00:29:13.998 --> 00:29:15.099]  Airborne units.
[00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:19.563]  Rangers and Special Forces are just specialized versions of paratroopers.
[00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:22.105]  They're all paratroopers, but they're different units.
[00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.254]  You were on the Army and jumped out of airplanes.
[00:29:26.454 --> 00:29:27.535]  You were jumping out of airplanes.
[00:29:27.596 --> 00:29:28.296]  Okay, there we go.
[00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:30.379]  Until I hit a big tree one night.
[00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:32.482]  That was it.
[00:29:32.983 --> 00:29:37.549]  So, yeah, I was at the Knoxville rally yesterday.
[00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:40.853]  I was a guest speaker there, and I can tell you that you don't
[00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:42.548]  It's not left and right.
[00:29:42.928 --> 00:29:44.089]  Like you said, it's two puppets.
[00:29:44.109 --> 00:29:44.970]  That's a pretty good analogy.
[00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:46.912]  Two puppets being held by the same master.
[00:29:47.313 --> 00:29:55.761]  And so whether they're on the far left or the far right or whatever their label you want to put on them, fascist or communist or whatever it is, it's about totalitarianism versus freedom.
[00:29:56.161 --> 00:30:02.948]  And so like you said, we get back to the very basics of our republic, back to core Americanism, deflation, independence, the Bill of Rights.
[00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.209]  I don't think so.
[00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:20.878]  We're good to go.
[00:30:37.765 --> 00:30:39.066]  And that worries the system.
[00:30:39.086 --> 00:30:46.472]  And just to interrupt, two weeks ago, it's in the local newspaper that they're going to run regular army checkpoints and Air Force MPs in Tennessee.
[00:30:47.693 --> 00:30:48.793]  The governor gets called.
[00:30:48.973 --> 00:30:53.037]  He goes out and does a press release saying, I didn't hear about this, but now I'm canceling it.
[00:30:53.857 --> 00:31:01.661]  And then it came out in newspapers that the Army, with the State Police and the Feds, and the Air Force, shot down major highways.
[00:31:01.761 --> 00:31:09.544]  This is in the news, with photos of the cars backed up, with troops searching vehicles, and the military just said, you know what, we're going to do it.
[00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:12.245]  And this has gotten hardly any attention.
[00:31:12.946 --> 00:31:14.066]  You say you're in Tennessee.
[00:31:14.867 --> 00:31:16.187]  Stewart, this is amazing.
[00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.528]  We've got to make a big deal out of this.
[00:31:18.408 --> 00:31:18.908]  Absolutely.
[00:31:19.268 --> 00:31:21.169]  And that's one thing that happens all the time.
[00:31:21.209 --> 00:31:22.290]  And Hitler did the same thing.
[00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:29.153]  He destroyed the independence of the provinces, he solidified power at the national level, and he made each province just a puppet.
[00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:32.934]  And that's the pattern that every tyrannical government goes through.
[00:31:33.134 --> 00:31:36.936]  Destroying any separation of powers from the national government and local government.
[00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:58.068]  And so, one thing I did want to announce is that for our April 19th rally in the Lexington Green in Lexington, Massachusetts, this Sunday, we have added Richard Mack as going to be one of our guest speakers, and also Guy Cunningham, who was the author of the 29 Palms survey, where they asked Marines whether or not they would fire on Americans who were resisting gun confiscation.
[00:31:58.801 --> 00:32:07.567]  Um, he's a patriot and he wrote that because he was concerned about the, uh, the pattern he saw of the troops not understanding the Constitution and being, um...
[00:32:08.405 --> 00:32:09.886]  Conditioned to accept U.N.
[00:32:09.946 --> 00:32:13.549]  command and other things that he found disturbing and contrary to our constitution.
[00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.811]  And Stuart, do me a favor.
[00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:18.794]  Make sure, in fact, can you get us his number?
[00:32:19.094 --> 00:32:22.157]  I want to make sure I can get him aside for 20-30 minutes to interview him.
[00:32:22.557 --> 00:32:26.160]  Yourself and everybody else, I am sending a crew of two people up there.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.522]  I'm sending Aaron Dykes and Rob Due.
[00:32:29.043 --> 00:32:31.285]  So I really look forward to that.
[00:32:31.345 --> 00:32:33.326]  So please try to, today,
[00:32:34.537 --> 00:32:40.521]  To give Rob that fella's number, because I want to line up the interview before we get there.
[00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:42.023]  But that's very exciting.
[00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.985]  You also have a famous Navy SEAL captain there, correctly?
[00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:46.005]  Correct.
[00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:48.027]  And a lot of other folks.
[00:32:48.047 --> 00:32:49.128]  Tell people about that.
[00:32:49.861 --> 00:32:55.303]  Well, we're going to have an oath ceremony there on the Green to renew all of us who took an oath to defend the Constitution.
[00:32:55.723 --> 00:32:58.984]  We'll renew our oath right there on Lexington Green on April 19th.
[00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:04.546]  It's going to be a very historic and very emotional experience, I'm sure.
[00:33:04.866 --> 00:33:08.247]  We've got active duty military flying in from all over the country and active duty police.
[00:33:08.727 --> 00:33:10.829]  We've got high-ranking military officers coming in there.
[00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:14.112]  They're going to be there in their dress uniform, and then also us veterans.
[00:33:14.732 --> 00:33:21.218]  And we also invite just average citizens who have never taken an oath before, but they want to come and take the oath for the first time.
[00:33:21.238 --> 00:33:22.479]  They can raise their right hand.
[00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:24.160]  I did that yesterday at Knoxville.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.003]  It was an exciting versus a wonderful experience.
[00:33:27.023 --> 00:33:29.345]  A crowd of about 2,000 people raised their hand and swore.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.642]  Excuse me, sworn up to defend the Constitution, but it was fantastic.
[00:33:34.002 --> 00:33:39.286]  And the video for that is up on our website at oath-keepers.blogspot.com.
[00:33:39.846 --> 00:33:42.268]  Oath-keepers.blogspot.com.
[00:33:42.548 --> 00:33:44.389]  You folks can go there and watch that video.
[00:33:44.409 --> 00:33:46.550]  So we're going to do the same thing again on election green.
[00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:56.657]  To me, it's really the first public meeting of Oath Keepers though, because yesterday these are folks who didn't even know who we were, and I just showed up there as a guest speaker and kind of caught them off guard.
[00:33:57.137 --> 00:34:02.621]  But, uh, got them all to stand up and raise their right hand and reaffirm their oath or take the oath for the first time.
[00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:13.827]  And this is gonna spread like wildfire, because we've got the state police training manuals that the feds put out, and then we even have the footage of squad car video in my film Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:14.148 --> 00:34:24.354]  At a warrantless checkpoint, they find a pocket constitution in the woman's car and flip out and arrest her for it, and it's them on video going, I can't believe she's got one of these, she's one of them deadly ones.
[00:34:24.394 --> 00:34:24.874]  I saw that.
[00:34:25.034 --> 00:34:25.754]  I remember seeing that.
[00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:27.175]  And that's why we've got to stand up.
[00:34:27.255 --> 00:34:28.495]  And that's why it has to be done.
[00:34:28.555 --> 00:34:37.117]  I think the tip of the spear, disillusioned warfare, needs to be the, you know, the hardcore troops, the guys who've been there, and the police who stand up and say, you know what?
[00:34:37.557 --> 00:34:39.058]  We are constitutionalists.
[00:34:39.198 --> 00:34:42.519]  You want to make them as constitutionalists and separate us from them?
[00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:42.979]  Well, guess what?
[00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:44.419]  We are constitutionalists.
[00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:50.761]  Which is exactly why you saw that Department of Homeland Security, the latest report, they call it a report, it's just propaganda.
[00:34:51.161 --> 00:34:55.103]  Well, labeling returning veterans as a potential terrorist threat is just amazing.
[00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:56.084]  Well, that's what it is.
[00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:59.725]  It is, well, yeah, in fact, comment on that.
[00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:06.829]  It is a secret police commissariat political police report like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or Maoist China.
[00:35:07.129 --> 00:35:13.612]  I mean, out of the textbook it says the number one threat is returning troops, gun owners, people buying all these guns and ammo.
[00:35:13.792 --> 00:35:15.493]  This is the number one terror threat.
[00:35:15.813 --> 00:35:16.714]  That is a quote.
[00:35:17.094 --> 00:35:19.256]  And they have really upset people.
[00:35:19.616 --> 00:35:21.558]  And can't the police put two and two together?
[00:35:21.898 --> 00:35:23.459]  Most of the police are former military.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.941]  They're saying, you're the threat.
[00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:27.623]  And what's the first thing Hitler wiped out when he got power?
[00:35:27.963 --> 00:35:30.385]  When he was going to betray everybody and do the opposite of what he said.
[00:35:30.705 --> 00:35:34.568]  He killed the police and military in the night of the long knives.
[00:35:34.989 --> 00:35:37.891]  So explain to folks how big a deal this is.
[00:35:37.931 --> 00:35:39.392]  And I agree, they screwed up by doing this.
[00:35:39.432 --> 00:35:39.853]  Break it down.
[00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:41.573]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:35:41.613 --> 00:35:46.638]  What they're trying to do is purge and kill your speech.
[00:35:47.038 --> 00:35:52.804]  They want returning veterans to be concerned and worried that they're going to be labeled a terrorist.
[00:35:52.904 --> 00:35:56.447]  Apparently, they can see anybody who took an oath to defend the Constitution.
[00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:57.248]  I'm certain to think this.
[00:35:57.949 --> 00:36:03.254]  They must think that we are a threat, because they know we mean it, and they know we're going to keep our oath.
[00:36:05.055 --> 00:36:13.081]  This is their preemptive way of starting to label returning veterans as crazy and kooky and potential terrorist threats and all that kind of thing.
[00:36:13.562 --> 00:36:19.706]  To get them to chill their speech and not become politically active or not become active in organizations like Goat Keepers.
[00:36:20.487 --> 00:36:22.829]  But the way to fight that is just with light.
[00:36:23.149 --> 00:36:24.430]  Shine a light on it like you've been doing.
[00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.432]  You shine a light on the cockroaches, they scurry away.
[00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:27.372]  Shine a light.
[00:36:27.653 --> 00:36:28.053]  But you know what?
[00:36:28.233 --> 00:36:31.596]  I think the Obama administration has made some disastrous mistakes.
[00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.351]  And by the way, she has now come out and says that she doesn't apologize for these reports.
[00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:35.791]  That's right.
[00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:37.111]  She says I've looked at every possible threat.
[00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:04.729]  Once again, if you're a constitutionalist, you're a possible threat.
[00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.570]  And you know what?
[00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.071]  We are.
[00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:08.913]  Quite frankly, we're not a threat to the American people.
[00:37:08.933 --> 00:37:12.356]  We're not terrorists, but we are a threat to their attempt to destroy our republic.
[00:37:12.857 --> 00:37:13.858]  By God, we better be.
[00:37:14.238 --> 00:37:15.940]  Everyone has sworn up to defend the Constitution.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.043]  Of course we're not going to stand by and let that happen.
[00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:22.105]  No, exactly.
[00:37:22.165 --> 00:37:27.830]  We have the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, common law, common sense, organic law on our side.
[00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:37.097]  You have these foreign bankers usurping our country through the executive, both parties, stealing $12.8 trillion in six months, the GDP in half a year.
[00:37:37.597 --> 00:37:39.018]  They're totally taking over.
[00:37:39.478 --> 00:37:41.719]  They're violating our rights and liberties at every level.
[00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:45.221]  They're butchering every basic canon of a free society.
[00:37:45.581 --> 00:37:51.164]  We are in the right under the Declaration of Independence to arrest all these people through the grand juries, through indictments.
[00:37:51.444 --> 00:37:57.286]  So they've got to declare us the enemy and us the terrorists because they are the ones terrorizing our liberty.
[00:37:57.507 --> 00:37:58.407]  They are the criminals.
[00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:00.388]  They are the ones that must be brought to justice.
[00:38:00.608 --> 00:38:01.448]  It's so simple.
[00:38:01.768 --> 00:38:12.271]  They have to indict us, accuse us, demonize us, because what they're doing is so outrageous and criminal, they know if the people ever get control of this country again, they're all going to prison.
[00:38:12.512 --> 00:38:13.932]  And so this is a very bold action.
[00:38:13.972 --> 00:38:16.653]  I keep telling people, the elite are going for broke.
[00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:24.062]  The level of crimes and looting and corruption they have engaged means they are going all the way to the wall, folks.
[00:38:24.323 --> 00:38:26.564]  This is not a drill or not an exercise.
[00:38:26.584 --> 00:38:31.267]  They plan a hot revolution in this country of power and tyranny.
[00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:32.888]  They are the revolutionaries.
[00:38:32.968 --> 00:38:34.169]  We are the restorationists.
[00:38:34.409 --> 00:38:41.054]  We just want our Bill of Rights and Constitution and liberty, not their old-time religion of tyranny.
[00:38:41.234 --> 00:38:42.895]  They claim they're doing a new world order.
[00:38:43.095 --> 00:38:44.056]  Everything with them is a lie.
[00:38:44.096 --> 00:38:47.038]  It's the old world order, the Roman tyranny.
[00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.540]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:55.607]  I mean, they're the assaulters on the Constitution and the American Republic, and we're the defenders.
[00:38:55.947 --> 00:39:02.134]  And so they have to make the people think the exact opposite, that we're the threat to them when we're their protectors.
[00:39:02.814 --> 00:39:05.237]  And so that's why it's absolutely imperative that
[00:39:06.451 --> 00:39:14.534]  Officers stand up, police officers, the military stand up, and they do it in large enough numbers that you can't just dismiss them as lone crazies or whatever.
[00:39:14.574 --> 00:39:16.835]  You have to acknowledge that this is mainstream.
[00:39:17.175 --> 00:39:19.076]  And by the way, it takes a lot of courage.
[00:39:19.416 --> 00:39:21.237]  Don't you have some generals and people coming?
[00:39:22.598 --> 00:39:29.760]  I mean, to have regular, you know, in-the-military officers coming and swearing their oath, that's how close to midnight it is.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.462]  One lieutenant commander put it, one lieutenant commander of the Navy, he said,
[00:39:34.482 --> 00:39:39.686]  I have nothing to fear because all I'm doing is reaffirming my obligation to follow the law.
[00:39:40.247 --> 00:39:44.991]  I'm not going there to wage war on the American people.
[00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:51.896]  But that shows how close to midnight it is, is that it is radical to have people stand up and say, I won't put Americans in camps.
[00:39:52.697 --> 00:40:00.840]  Yeah, you talk like, you quote Jefferson, and John Adams, and Sam Adams, and they consider you a threat, and we are a threat to their plans.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.981]  That's absolutely correct, because we're not going to let them do it.
[00:40:05.241 --> 00:40:09.263]  Like, in some ways, you know, the report is accurate, but not the way they spin it.
[00:40:09.283 --> 00:40:14.845]  They say, well, we're going to go blow up, you know, kill babies and blow up people, you know, and they're racist.
[00:40:15.929 --> 00:40:17.050]  Oh yeah, that's the worst part.
[00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.751]  Well they're upset, the people that were buying guns are upset because he's black.
[00:40:20.832 --> 00:40:25.834]  No, we're upset because as a state senator he called for complete gun bans.
[00:40:26.154 --> 00:40:32.697]  His attorney general in the briefing last year before the Supreme Court said citizens should not be able to own a single shot.
[00:40:33.037 --> 00:40:42.442]  I mean he wants total gun ban and they've introduced the bills and you've now got the governor of Pennsylvania calling for gun bans and so again we're in reality but
[00:40:43.422 --> 00:40:50.283]  For those that don't understand this, we are at a historic crossroads, and I can see it in their eyes and their actions.
[00:40:50.464 --> 00:40:52.164]  I realize they're actually intimidated.
[00:40:52.604 --> 00:40:56.225]  They realize that they've put their criminal action into motion.
[00:40:56.485 --> 00:41:00.746]  It's a machine they can't turn off, and I think they're starting to brace for the fact.
[00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:02.466]  I mean, it's like when you get in a fight.
[00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:07.267]  Some bully punches you, and then you gear up and start punching back, and you can tell you're going to whoop their ass.
[00:41:07.907 --> 00:41:09.288]  I mean, that's the feeling right here.
[00:41:09.328 --> 00:41:11.028]  We are going to kick the New World Order's butt.
[00:41:12.307 --> 00:41:20.076]  Yeah, and they realize that they thought you were going to be an easy victim, and the next thing you know, you slam him on the ground and you're mounted on top of him and you're going to punch him in the face.
[00:41:24.352 --> 00:41:32.680]  One thing I wanted to say is that we're going to have retired Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey administer the oath, unless Judge Napolitano wants to come and administer the oath.
[00:41:33.161 --> 00:41:36.164]  Sometimes it's hard to reach people, but we give an open invitation to him.
[00:41:36.204 --> 00:41:42.009]  If he shows up, all he's got to do is show up and he can administer the oath, because I can't think of a more consistent judge.
[00:41:42.289 --> 00:41:44.892]  Okay, well, listen, I promised.
[00:41:44.972 --> 00:41:45.713]  I promised.
[00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:56.674]  to cover this new angle on these federal reports demonizing Christians, gun owners, the troops, ammo owners.
[00:41:57.114 --> 00:42:00.216]  So if you'll do this, Stuart, I'll put you on hold.
[00:42:00.556 --> 00:42:08.641]  When Napolitano comes on at the start of the next hour, I'll introduce him for about five minutes, and then you can come on and invite him, because I know he's in New York.
[00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:17.566]  I don't know if he can come, but you can invite him on air and put him on the spot if you'd like, or do you want me to ask him and then offer to give him your number?
[00:42:18.847 --> 00:42:27.129]  Either way, we just want to, I mean, everyone's welcome, and it would just be wonderful to have a judge like that, make the experience all the more special.
[00:42:27.149 --> 00:42:29.129]  Because here's the thing, this has been done before.
[00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:30.870]  This is not the first time.
[00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.370]  There's historic precedent.
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:46.433]  In 1798, a militia company stood on the green and renewed their oath, sent a letter to John Adams, who was president at the time, and he wrote back in response to them and said, by renewing your oath on that sacred spot,
[00:42:47.668 --> 00:42:50.754]  You have reaffirmed your devotion to your country.
[00:42:50.994 --> 00:42:51.715]  It was just brilliant.
[00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:54.300]  We're going to use that quote and we stand on the green.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.321]  It's been done before.
[00:42:55.362 --> 00:42:55.702]  We're fathers.
[00:42:55.742 --> 00:42:57.505]  Yeah, but you're talking about founding fathers.
[00:42:57.545 --> 00:42:58.287]  That's al-Qaeda.
[00:42:58.307 --> 00:42:59.749]  I mean, this is really radical stuff.
[00:43:00.572 --> 00:43:04.555]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:43:04.835 --> 00:43:09.458]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:43:09.738 --> 00:43:12.160]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:17.564]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[00:43:17.864 --> 00:43:26.630]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing those high interest fees and rolling everything into one low monthly payment.
[00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:27.110]  We're good to go.
[00:43:55.975 --> 00:44:06.281]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:06.781 --> 00:44:13.784]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:44:14.365 --> 00:44:20.528]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:20.948 --> 00:44:22.789]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:22.909 --> 00:44:25.331]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:25.411 --> 00:44:36.357]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:36.997 --> 00:44:38.278]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:38.678 --> 00:44:40.059]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:46.743]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:47.432 --> 00:44:55.198]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:55.698 --> 00:44:56.839]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:57.259 --> 00:44:58.460]  The people strike back!
[00:45:00.396 --> 00:45:08.502]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:45:08.662 --> 00:45:13.065]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:45:13.225 --> 00:45:17.728]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:45:17.888 --> 00:45:19.289]  It's a documented fact.
[00:45:20.169 --> 00:45:26.772]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:38.778]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:45:39.018 --> 00:45:42.700]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.702]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:45:46.422 --> 00:45:50.125]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:53.447]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:53.667]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:46:10.191 --> 00:46:14.353]  Okay, Judge Napolitano's coming up in the second half of the next hour.
[00:46:14.634 --> 00:46:18.596]  Just to be clear, it was my sheet said two, but he's actually about 220 or so.
[00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.317]  So that is coming up.
[00:46:20.397 --> 00:46:24.619]  Quick update from him on the whole federal reports demonizing patriots and more.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.341]  Stuart Rhodes founded Oath Keepers.
[00:46:27.361 --> 00:46:28.241]  That's coming up this weekend.
[00:46:28.261 --> 00:46:29.061]  We were talking during the break.
[00:46:29.082 --> 00:46:31.283]  He was saying, yeah, it really is starting to come to a head.
[00:46:31.983 --> 00:46:42.809]  I want to make sure this doesn't turn into riots and a shooting war, and watching CNN try to start physical fights with people, watching Anderson Cooper calling the people horrible, sexual expletives.
[00:46:43.229 --> 00:46:45.870]  I can't believe I'm seeing this on CNN and MSNBC.
[00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:54.175]  They're trying to energize it to make it a left-right fight, because again, 98%, 99% of all the polls are against the Banker Takeover.
[00:46:54.515 --> 00:46:56.696]  They want to make it about Republicans and George Bush.
[00:46:56.736 --> 00:46:57.016]  It's like 20-30%.
[00:46:59.096 --> 00:47:00.857]  To automatically divide and conquer.
[00:47:01.297 --> 00:47:04.058]  And it's so obvious, we gotta get that message out to people.
[00:47:04.078 --> 00:47:08.899]  But I have heard, quote, liberals calling into Air America and stuff going, no, there's a lot of us out here.
[00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:13.461]  So the left at first was trying to make this a fight, but now they're failing.
[00:47:13.481 --> 00:47:20.503]  And that's the good news is, with every successive month that follows, more and more people wake up to the two-puppet system.
[00:47:23.204 --> 00:47:25.405]  So Stuart, again, you say this is coming to a head.
[00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:31.930]  Absolutely, I think that their attack on veterans is an indication of their fear.
[00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:36.274]  But here's the thing, we're not, this is not Germany, our oath was not to the Fuhrer.
[00:47:36.755 --> 00:47:42.780]  So they can't demonize people who are going to stand by the Constitution, our oath was to the Constitution.
[00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:46.624]  And it's not Russia or China, we're not Russian or Chinese peasants either.
[00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:48.386]  This is America, we've got a heritage.
[00:47:49.126 --> 00:47:49.986]  We're good to go.
[00:48:06.312 --> 00:48:06.672]  Alright, well...
[00:48:30.785 --> 00:48:37.050]  Well, we salute you and we appreciate you, Stuart Rhodes, and I can't wait to see the video that my guys shoot up there with you.
[00:48:37.371 --> 00:48:40.073]  So God bless you and take care, and I'll give Napolitano your number.
[00:48:40.093 --> 00:48:41.294]  Thank you, sir.
[00:48:41.735 --> 00:48:42.956]  The good Napolitano.
[00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:47.840]  The Judge Napolitano, not that Homeland Security that says, yeah, the veteran's a terrorist.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.781]  And that means you too, the police, folks.
[00:48:50.162 --> 00:48:54.606]  I told you, you're the first ones they're going to go after with the attack pattern I've been seeing.
[00:48:55.805 --> 00:49:04.835]  So when we come back, I'm going to play Christenberg's Revolution and then we're going to get into the latest developments, big breaking news on these MIAC reports and more.
[00:49:05.356 --> 00:49:15.187]  Some key angles we haven't gotten into yet that people need to understand that nobody is pointing out and then we'll go back to your phone calls and Judge Napolitano is scheduled for the show.
[00:49:16.028 --> 00:49:23.432]  Before I end this hour, I want to encourage listeners and viewers again to not procrastinate and get in the info war.
[00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:27.575]  And shattering a left-right paradigm, I keep harping on that, is the absolute key.
[00:49:28.155 --> 00:49:32.198]  My film, The Obama Deception, the first five minutes of the 113-minute film
[00:49:34.921 --> 00:49:53.559]  It instantly shatters the paradigm, and shows you that the same people that ran Bush run Obama, that Obama has lied about everything he said he would do, about hiring lobbyists and ending the wars, and not spying on the American people, and shutting down the FEMA camps, and shutting down the torture camps.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:58.044]  It's now, even Oberman's having to come out against him and say, no, he lied, it's worse than Bush.
[00:49:58.744 --> 00:50:00.987]  Uh, Bush tripled government we thought was impossible.
[00:50:01.367 --> 00:50:03.009]  We railed against him, but as a puppet.
[00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:06.212]  And then Obama is going to double what Bush did in one year.
[00:50:07.393 --> 00:50:07.974]  In one year.
[00:50:09.215 --> 00:50:12.038]  So, it is just... And then he says he's gonna balance the budget.
[00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.391]  I mean, just complete lies!
[00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:25.795]  The arrogance of the lies, the taking all these good people who believed in him, who thought they were repudiating Bush, not knowing they just put a new fresh horse into the race, and that it was a total setup.

[00:50:56.964 --> 00:50:59.726]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:02.787]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:02.967 --> 00:51:08.851]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:51:09.071 --> 00:51:11.933]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:51:55.693 --> 00:51:58.443]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:24.022 --> 00:52:27.783]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:52:27.803 --> 00:52:32.924]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:52:34.844 --> 00:52:39.425]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:52:40.205 --> 00:52:43.586]  And they whisper the word, revolution.
[00:52:45.366 --> 00:52:49.427]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[00:52:51.124 --> 00:52:54.745]  There are tall ships flying off the coast.
[00:52:56.926 --> 00:53:01.828]  And they carry the light in the dark of the night.
[00:53:02.468 --> 00:53:04.769]  Like a whisper in the wind.
[00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:05.789]  Evolution!
[00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:12.212]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver.
[00:53:14.113 --> 00:53:17.654]  By the sea we will gather for the fight.

[00:57:51.024 --> 00:57:52.645]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:58:03.425 --> 00:58:05.546]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:06.046 --> 00:58:13.028]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:13.629 --> 00:58:19.791]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:20.211 --> 00:58:22.052]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:22.173 --> 00:58:24.614]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:24.694 --> 00:58:35.642]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:36.262 --> 00:58:37.563]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:37.943 --> 00:58:39.324]  It's about a one-world government.

[01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:07.771]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.491 --> 01:00:09.572]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.253 --> 01:00:11.053]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:12.714]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:17.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.578 --> 01:00:21.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.696 --> 01:00:38.956]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:38.996 --> 01:00:43.837]  We've got 52 minutes left in this live Thursday transmission.
[01:00:43.877 --> 01:00:46.318]  I tell you, these days just go by like they're minutes now.
[01:00:47.698 --> 01:00:48.998]  How do you slow things down?
[01:00:49.739 --> 01:00:55.200]  It is the 16th day, of course, the day after tax day where you pay the private Federal Reserve.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.240]  See, Americans, a lot of them think this is for the infrastructure.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.281]  All the income tax goes to private offshore banks, always has.
[01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:06.062]  Now they're just massively increasing the amount of money that goes to them.
[01:01:07.005 --> 01:01:08.787]  For the pleasure of using our own money.
[01:01:08.887 --> 01:01:12.351]  It's a total bait-and-switch fraud, like everything else in this society.
[01:01:12.371 --> 01:01:15.514]  Alright, here is the breaking news, then I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:01:18.137 --> 01:01:23.964]  National Security Watch, 60 right-wing terror plots foiled.
[01:01:27.011 --> 01:01:29.532]  Now notice this is all coming out right at one time.
[01:01:29.892 --> 01:01:35.835]  When Dick Cheney wanted to come out in 2004 and say, there will guaranteed be a nuke attack by the time of the election.
[01:01:36.255 --> 01:01:37.596]  You must vote for George Bush.
[01:01:37.656 --> 01:01:41.017]  This is the publication he used to put that propaganda out.
[01:01:41.738 --> 01:01:41.978]  Okay?
[01:01:44.011 --> 01:01:51.817]  So, National Security Watch, 60 right-wing terror plots foiled in the 10 years since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people.
[01:01:51.937 --> 01:01:54.539]  By the way, that was a federal bombing, we've proven that.
[01:01:55.039 --> 01:02:02.204]  Roughly 60 right-wing terrorist plots have been uncovered in the United States, according to an upcoming report by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project.
[01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:07.708]  In Oklahoma City, it was the Southern Poverty Law Center running the white supremacist compound.
[01:02:08.008 --> 01:02:10.450]  They didn't just infiltrate it, they ran the whole thing.
[01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:12.912]  And it turned out McVeigh was the government operative they set up.
[01:02:13.874 --> 01:02:15.696]  Let's come out and declassify government documents.
[01:02:16.076 --> 01:02:18.339]  So a very nasty organization, to say the least.
[01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:21.442]  You know, they always catch firefighters setting fires.
[01:02:21.462 --> 01:02:22.583]  You know, it's that same thing.
[01:02:23.864 --> 01:02:29.670]  Or Department of Homeland Security groups that are, quote, anti-child molestation and keeps turning out their child molesters.
[01:02:31.172 --> 01:02:33.614]  Southern Poverty Law Center running the white supremacist operations.
[01:02:33.975 --> 01:02:35.656]  Kind of like we had the
[01:02:38.846 --> 01:02:47.329]  Bombsteer Award and Texas Monthly went to the FBI back in the late 90s for creating fake Klan groups and trying to get them to carry out terror attacks.
[01:02:47.409 --> 01:02:50.570]  I mean, they don't just go out and find a Klan group and try to sting them.
[01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:51.190]  No, no, no.
[01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.491]  They try to get them to carry it out.
[01:02:54.912 --> 01:03:12.563]  The plots, all foiled by law enforcement, reportedly included violent plans by anti-government militia groups, racist skinhead organizations and Ku Klux Klan members, and they even cite admitted staged events, by the way, to use various types of chemical bombs and other weapons.
[01:03:13.479 --> 01:03:19.901]  The plots demonstrate the Department of Homeland Security still needs to closely monitor right-wing groups, says Heidi Barrick.
[01:03:21.042 --> 01:03:31.806]  That was the lady that talked to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and said, within hours, oh, the cop shooter, the alleged cop shooter, he visited Infowars.com.
[01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:40.189]  And then it's in the newspaper that the guy loved me, and then later the newspaper, and everybody has to write other articles saying actually he was attacking Alex because Alex doesn't get into the race.
[01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:46.121]  Hundreds and hundreds of sites he visited, including CNN and Fox, they've now released that.
[01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:48.042]  But they're me!
[01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:48.502]  Why?
[01:03:48.682 --> 01:03:50.123]  Because I exposed their game.
[01:03:50.543 --> 01:03:52.344]  That's why the Southern Primary Law Center hates my guts.
[01:03:52.804 --> 01:04:03.008]  Hey, I'm sorry you founded a white supremacist organization that the police reported was planning to bomb OKC, and then we got the federal documents and had the lawyers on about that.
[01:04:03.028 --> 01:04:10.392]  I mean, look, I understand you're not too proud of what you're involved in, and it's kind of your business to claim you're fighting extremists, so
[01:04:11.485 --> 01:04:14.690]  You know, there needs to be a threat out there for you to exist.
[01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:15.311]  We understand.
[01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:17.974]  It's just we understand you're very sick.
[01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:24.223]  We understand that we know, that you know, that we know, that you're aware, that we can bring you down.
[01:04:25.305 --> 01:04:26.046]  Because the kryptonite
[01:04:28.457 --> 01:04:48.424]  To bring down you, Mr. Bizarro, Southern Poverty Law Center, Bizarro's kryptonite is the fact that the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center and others have been caught over and over again running white supremacist groups and other groups as a pretext to violate the Bill of Rights Constitution, to point at the Nazis and others and then try to restrict the Internet and freedom of speech and other things.
[01:04:48.825 --> 01:04:54.647]  It's come out in mainstream news, London Guardian and others, that all the major German white supremacist groups that are firebombing
[01:04:56.527 --> 01:04:58.028]  Turks and others, killing them!
[01:04:58.348 --> 01:04:59.708]  Turned out we're German intelligence.
[01:04:59.748 --> 01:05:01.029]  We understand how you operate.
[01:05:01.869 --> 01:05:02.869]  We understand how you operate.
[01:05:02.889 --> 01:05:03.290]  Don't worry.
[01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.050]  We're on to you.
[01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:10.252]  Just like German intelligence, Andreas Strassmayer was your agent heading up Elohim City with McVeigh.
[01:05:12.573 --> 01:05:14.453]  German intelligence, and that's now come out.
[01:05:15.674 --> 01:05:17.534]  Oh, we're on to you, Mr. Deese.
[01:05:18.154 --> 01:05:23.156]  And so, that's why your slander, trying to connect me to these people, isn't going to work.
[01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:35.515]  The plots demonstrate the Department of Homeland Security still needs to close in on their right-wing grip, says Heidi Baric with the Intelligence Project, which I have a copy of.
[01:05:35.535 --> 01:05:39.398]  They even have Lou Dobbs in here saying he's basically a white supremacist.
[01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:45.656]  Because he talks about the New World Order when they announce they're setting up a world government, he'll talk about it.
[01:05:45.696 --> 01:05:47.877]  So you stick him in here next to the Nazis.
[01:05:48.457 --> 01:05:50.477]  How many of these Nazi groups do you run?
[01:05:50.858 --> 01:05:51.918]  Southern Poverty Law Center?
[01:05:52.578 --> 01:05:53.599]  How many of these guys?
[01:05:53.619 --> 01:05:59.441]  Because I've been out to protest the Nazis in Austin, and I guarantee you that these aren't Nazis.
[01:06:00.941 --> 01:06:02.502]  And then they just caught them, what, last year?
[01:06:05.071 --> 01:06:14.681]  In Miami and other areas, it was in the major newspapers, it was in the Orlando's newspaper, that the head of the white supremacist rally was FBI.
[01:06:14.701 --> 01:06:18.364]  I mean, my God, we're so tired of your Nazis!
[01:06:19.445 --> 01:06:20.606]  We're just really sick of you.
[01:06:20.787 --> 01:06:21.147]  Anyways.
[01:06:21.968 --> 01:06:23.770]  But see, that's a perfect way for you to hide, though.
[01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:25.471]  She is the anti-Nazi group.
[01:06:27.133 --> 01:06:28.114]  Oh, you people are sick.
[01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:40.664]  He goes on, the DHS report listed radical leftist groups such as the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, which have both involved numerous arson cases but non-violent right-wing militia and skinhead groups.
[01:06:40.684 --> 01:06:44.266]  And he's talking about how it's such a big deal that the DHS report has come out.
[01:06:44.726 --> 01:06:47.967]  Okay, let's stop right there and that brings me to my next point.
[01:06:51.369 --> 01:06:53.630]  And I want Curt Nemo and Paul Watson listening right now.
[01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.352]  I need big reports from both of you on this from different angles, whatever your perspective is.
[01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:13.641]  But remember, we put out the flyer in the late 90s that the FBI was putting out with the FBI's phone number saying, those that make frequent references, in fact, punch it up on screen, just type in, constitutional terrorist, and it'll come up.
[01:07:14.882 --> 01:07:21.389]  And when we put that report out, then we got all these other internal state police reports, federal, marshal reports that they sent us.
[01:07:22.392 --> 01:07:31.955]  Where people that have organic gardens, people that protest animal testing, people that protest nuclear reactors, people that protest anything.
[01:07:32.955 --> 01:07:43.459]  It's turned out they're spying on bike riding groups that want more rights for people to have, you know, bike lanes and anti-death penalty groups are being listed as terrorists with no violence in their past.
[01:07:43.739 --> 01:07:50.121]  Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9-11 shows, you know, a little peace group baking cookies and they've got, you know, the police spying on them and
[01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:57.969]  And it came out Army Intelligence was spying on us back in November at the end of the Fed protest saying, watch out, the terrorists may attack you, don't let them know you're military.
[01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:01.453]  And then the military leaked this to us because they're upset about it.
[01:08:02.614 --> 01:08:04.336]  But the media doesn't want to hype that part.
[01:08:04.756 --> 01:08:08.040]  They hype only certain parts of the reports because they want to make this a left-right thing.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.823]  They want to announce, oh, all the Tea Party protesters are terrorists.
[01:08:11.997 --> 01:08:18.643]  And they're right-wingers, and then all the leftists go, oh my God, well I'm not with those right-wing Nazi terrorists.
[01:08:19.184 --> 01:08:21.346]  I must be for the bailout and the foreign bank's taking over.
[01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:22.627]  See how they play those games?
[01:08:22.687 --> 01:08:25.650]  Now they've divided the public in half.
[01:08:28.252 --> 01:08:37.260]  And then remember that back under Bush, it was in Alabama, it was in Tennessee, libertarians and liberal groups
[01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:39.808]  And you can Google those stories.
[01:08:39.848 --> 01:08:43.090]  Libertarians listed in a state police report.
[01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:48.032]  And you can pull those up where Libertarians and Liberals were being listed under Bush.
[01:08:48.553 --> 01:08:51.975]  But really what was happening, and I'm starting to think this is getting leaked on purpose in some cases,
[01:08:53.237 --> 01:08:58.100]  That I would actually get the full report and it would have right-wing, left-wing, everybody in there.
[01:08:58.781 --> 01:09:04.845]  But when it was Bush, they would talk about, oh, it's, Bush doesn't like the left-wing and says they're terrorists.
[01:09:05.245 --> 01:09:19.475]  And then now that Obama's in, they're putting out reports saying basically everybody's a terrorist, but the reports that get the attention, because there's a bunch of these reports, just in Missouri alone there were dozens of them, the feds wrote and put out, but now we have the national reports, they're talking about
[01:09:21.058 --> 01:09:24.264]  The right wing and the returning troops and gun owners.
[01:09:25.366 --> 01:09:32.318]  So then everybody can protest and demonstrate and the Republicans can act like they're anti-establishment and get all the anti-establishment support.
[01:09:33.675 --> 01:09:37.119]  And soak it up under their control, because they're controlled opposition.
[01:09:37.459 --> 01:09:40.662]  See, they want you inside the Republican or Democratic parties.
[01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.785]  Because they control both of those.
[01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:52.114]  And then when a Republican gets in power, the reports will be put out about how the Democrats are terrorists, and the Democrats will all feel radical and cutting-edge, and, oh, the Democrats, I guess, are anti-establishment.
[01:09:52.134 --> 01:09:52.835]  Look, we're being listed.
[01:09:55.718 --> 01:10:03.408]  I walked in this morning and had the idea to talk about this because I've been thinking about it the last few days and I said, there's one of the original reports in 99 out of Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:10:03.548 --> 01:10:07.372]  Show them the back where it says, those that make references to the Constitution are terrorists.
[01:10:07.873 --> 01:10:09.355]  And then it lists right wing and left wing.
[01:10:10.156 --> 01:10:10.897]  It shows them all there.
[01:10:11.906 --> 01:10:12.726]  Yeah, zoom in on that.
[01:10:13.207 --> 01:10:16.108]  Common Law, it says, uh, defenders of U.S.
[01:10:16.148 --> 01:10:18.809]  Constitution against federal government and U.N.
[01:10:18.869 --> 01:10:30.074]  super patriots, groups of individuals engaged in paramilitary training, they call that target shooting, uh, it talks about black separatists, mixes that in with KKK, so they go after everybody here.
[01:10:30.535 --> 01:10:35.377]  Common Law, uh, movement participants, and it says, uh,
[01:10:38.499 --> 01:10:41.584]  Refuse to identify themselves, make numerous references to the U.S.
[01:10:41.624 --> 01:10:42.325]  Constitution.
[01:10:42.345 --> 01:10:47.674]  And it's just like people at these illegal checkpoints go, well, you're stopping all the cars.
[01:10:47.714 --> 01:10:49.256]  You don't have a Fourth Amendment probable cause.
[01:10:49.276 --> 01:10:50.478]  They'll just beat you up now.
[01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:52.422]  These videos come out every week now.
[01:10:53.376 --> 01:10:56.398]  See, because the cops have been taught, oh my god, I got a cop killing terrorists right here.
[01:10:56.718 --> 01:10:58.739]  He's saying that, you know, a checkpoint isn't American.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.480]  Yeah, it's Nazi Germany, it's not freedom.
[01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:02.262]  Pull it back up, because I want to show people.
[01:11:02.462 --> 01:11:04.023]  Then over there they've got single issue.
[01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:07.325]  And they say, uh, urban riot agitators.
[01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:08.165]  Those are usually cops.
[01:11:08.185 --> 01:11:10.207]  They just got caught in Denver last year, Denver Post.
[01:11:10.487 --> 01:11:14.109]  Cops attacking other cops and staged an event for the media to demonize the protesters.
[01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:18.932]  Uh, they've got, uh, these groups are going to use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.
[01:11:19.593 --> 01:11:21.274]  Uh, that lone individuals are terrorists.
[01:11:22.374 --> 01:11:24.437]  They've got animal rights.
[01:11:24.477 --> 01:11:25.398]  They're terrorists.
[01:11:26.759 --> 01:11:28.321]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:11:30.964 --> 01:11:32.906]  And so they go after everybody here.
[01:11:33.346 --> 01:11:34.568]  That's what's really happening.
[01:11:34.628 --> 01:11:38.232]  So, when we get back, we should have quick Googled this morning.
[01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:40.174]  In minutes, they had this for me.
[01:11:41.355 --> 01:11:42.736]  All these other reports.
[01:11:44.457 --> 01:11:45.377]  And guess what?
[01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:47.338]  We got the PDF files code.
[01:11:47.738 --> 01:11:50.960]  This big report they're making a big deal out of that Obama just put out?
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.981]  It was originally written in 97.
[01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:58.383]  It just had the cops killings in Pennsylvania added last week.
[01:12:00.492 --> 01:12:01.472]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:12:01.552 --> 01:12:06.335]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:12:06.495 --> 01:12:14.298]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:12:14.558 --> 01:12:19.921]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:27.104]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:12:27.404 --> 01:12:32.747]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:12:33.007 --> 01:12:37.730]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:45.694]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:12:46.014 --> 01:12:48.716]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:52.260]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:12:52.581 --> 01:12:53.642]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:53.862]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:12:53.882 --> 01:12:56.926]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:06.634 --> 01:13:11.976]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:12.516 --> 01:13:18.698]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:18.938 --> 01:13:20.818]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:20.978 --> 01:13:23.359]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:34.342]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:36.636 --> 01:13:37.897]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:38.297 --> 01:13:39.678]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:40.158 --> 01:13:46.501]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:47.061 --> 01:13:54.845]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:55.325 --> 01:13:56.486]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:56.906 --> 01:13:58.167]  The people strike back.
[01:14:00.248 --> 01:14:03.089]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:06.211]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.761]  And it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:18.583]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:25.485]  At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[01:14:26.065 --> 01:14:32.526]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:14:32.846 --> 01:14:35.107]  Beware, be smart, and be ready!
[01:14:35.626 --> 01:14:41.451]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[01:14:41.992 --> 01:14:47.837]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[01:14:48.337 --> 01:14:51.900]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.903]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today!
[01:15:00.077 --> 01:15:03.000]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.264]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:15:07.424 --> 01:15:18.854]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:15:19.095 --> 01:15:24.920]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.340]  I think so.
[01:15:48.049 --> 01:15:48.409]  We're good.
[01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.027]  Okay, this happens all the time.
[01:16:12.107 --> 01:16:14.168]  Judge Napolitano works for Fox.
[01:16:14.929 --> 01:16:16.530]  He's invited me on his show countless times.
[01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:18.871]  I'm going to be back on his show many times.
[01:16:18.891 --> 01:16:21.653]  He's going to be back home with us next week.
[01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:23.394]  He had to go on Fox today.
[01:16:23.414 --> 01:16:29.338]  No big deal because I want to go to your phone calls and cover a bunch of other news and some breaking news we've got as well.
[01:16:29.358 --> 01:16:35.382]  But finishing up right now with the new information about all these federal reports demonizing American people.
[01:16:36.923 --> 01:16:38.264]  Don't you see the genius of it?
[01:16:38.944 --> 01:16:52.913]  By making it about right-wing extremists, it now intimidates anybody to think being against the corrupt banker bailout is right-wing and tied in with shooting people and dead cops and white supremacists.
[01:16:53.153 --> 01:16:54.214]  That's what the media is doing.
[01:16:54.374 --> 01:16:55.315]  It's totally ridiculous.
[01:16:56.383 --> 01:17:03.227]  And so it gets the whole focus off the bankers, the takeover, the collapsing economy into, let's look at the American people that criticize this.
[01:17:03.488 --> 01:17:05.109]  They're radical and dangerous and bad.
[01:17:05.409 --> 01:17:06.570]  You don't want to get on a list.
[01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:07.790]  Sit down and shut up.
[01:17:09.331 --> 01:17:21.139]  But it also seduces the left, who was against the secret police reports and being spied on under Bush, and they were doing it left-wing and right-wing and everybody in between, to like, yeah, we need to watch these people.
[01:17:21.179 --> 01:17:22.060]  They're dangerous.
[01:17:23.683 --> 01:17:31.919]  Just like the phony right-wing was all for secret police, secret torture, a million-plus dead Iraqis, all the things that happened in eight years under Bush, the Democrats went along with.
[01:17:33.802 --> 01:17:34.604]  So we googled
[01:17:36.807 --> 01:17:50.431]  Well, first off, if you go to the PDF file of this latest federal report that came out that's gotten all of the attention, the one that we called Sunday and confirmed was real.
[01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:52.591]  It was on a few websites, people going, is it real?
[01:17:52.691 --> 01:17:53.191]  I don't know!
[01:17:53.551 --> 01:17:59.333]  Well, I mean, I read it and said, oh, this is real, and then I called the feds and they admitted it was real, and we put the report out Sunday night and then it got big, but 1A-0257-09,
[01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:08.492]  Classified for official use, unclassified for official use only.
[01:18:09.533 --> 01:18:13.435]  This report, I knew I'd read pieces of it, other reports, that's how I knew it was real.
[01:18:14.076 --> 01:18:17.898]  Then we called and confirmed it, now the Homeland Security admits it and backs it up and says they support it.
[01:18:18.619 --> 01:18:19.119]  On record.
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.042]  Because I read all of this back under Bush.
[01:18:24.318 --> 01:18:26.680]  And I didn't think to go Google and pull up those old reports.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:27.920]  We've not done that today.
[01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:34.024]  But if you look at the file itself in the Adobe Acrobat Reader.
[01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:36.566]  Maybe you guys can punch this up on screen.
[01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:43.570]  This document was originally created in 2007 about the returning troops.
[01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:44.831]  And I've seen that in other documents.
[01:18:45.251 --> 01:18:47.152]  And the police are on record, you know, with these headlines.
[01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:57.284]  Military training police to deal with IEDs or exploding bombs on the sides of roads.
[01:18:57.905 --> 01:18:59.406]  So you can see that was created January 23, 2007.
[01:18:59.726 --> 01:19:04.950]  It was published at 1.32 p.m.
[01:19:06.432 --> 01:19:08.853]  and then it was modified April 7, 2009.
[01:19:09.254 --> 01:19:11.876]  They only added a few paragraphs in there.
[01:19:13.077 --> 01:19:13.437]  Okay?
[01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:17.560]  So this report came out under George Bush.
[01:19:17.601 --> 01:19:19.202]  People could say, well, we don't have the old report.
[01:19:21.018 --> 01:19:22.900]  Well, yeah, we do.
[01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:25.181]  Yes, we do.
[01:19:27.904 --> 01:19:30.726]  This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation Intelligence Assessment.
[01:19:31.787 --> 01:19:43.597]  This is the Federal Bureau of Intelligence Assessment, but they now have that as a sub-unit under Homeland Security, here on the final page, with the National Infrastructure Coordinating Center.
[01:19:43.837 --> 01:19:44.938]  You call one number, it's them.
[01:19:44.958 --> 01:19:47.220]  You call the other number, it's the FBI, as I did last Sunday night.
[01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:49.822]  And you see this right here?
[01:19:51.886 --> 01:19:52.666]  You see this right here?
[01:19:55.728 --> 01:20:00.550]  The Office of the Intelligence and Analysis Center Assessment, a division of the FBI.
[01:20:02.351 --> 01:20:03.932]  Well, what do we have here?
[01:20:04.892 --> 01:20:05.713]  From July 7, 2008.
[01:20:06.073 --> 01:20:07.814]  There's a whole bunch of these.
[01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:09.515]  These are all over the web.
[01:20:09.535 --> 01:20:10.295]  These have been out.
[01:20:11.155 --> 01:20:12.516]  We've always been covering these.
[01:20:12.656 --> 01:20:14.357]  Why did they decide to give it attention now?
[01:20:14.737 --> 01:20:16.358]  To polarize things left-right.
[01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:20.653]  And this basically says the same thing.
[01:20:21.393 --> 01:20:26.398]  Anybody who's pro-God is basically a white supremacist and the military is coming back and they're going to kill everybody.
[01:20:26.899 --> 01:20:31.002]  And I knew I had read much of what was in the new report, which we now learn is old.
[01:20:31.643 --> 01:20:34.105]  So again, this is what George Bush was putting out.
[01:20:36.388 --> 01:20:43.855]  And they're saying now, when we were talking to Napolitano, the breaking news, and who knows what's going to come out right now, is that George Bush is about to release
[01:20:45.498 --> 01:20:50.680]  More Homeland Security documents probably saying, oh yes, I'm worried about right-wingers too, to give Obama cover.
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:51.880]  Kind of like Bush Sr.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.782]  came out and bad-mouthed the NRA that time, and said he was getting rid of his membership.
[01:20:56.322 --> 01:21:00.903]  You know, they pile on against the American people from time to time.
[01:21:02.864 --> 01:21:06.806]  Now, here is the Council on Foreign Relations that really runs the policy of the government.
[01:21:07.706 --> 01:21:08.706]  4,000, almost 5,000 members.
[01:21:09.066 --> 01:21:10.687]  Militant extremists in the United States.
[01:21:11.907 --> 01:21:13.188]  And this is a report
[01:21:14.433 --> 01:21:15.435]  Uh, April 21st, 2008.
[01:21:15.916 --> 01:21:23.475]  And, uh, it's Types of Domestic Terrorism, says the Southern Poverty Law Centers, who compiled it for them.
[01:21:24.528 --> 01:21:28.869]  And it's got left-wing and right-wing terrorism, right-wing domestic terrorism.
[01:21:29.269 --> 01:21:33.370]  See, so what's happened is, everybody's focusing in on one little report.
[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:42.611]  The entire American people are basically listed as terrorists in this, and if they announced it like that, we'd all come together and say, this is police state, this is Nazi Germany, we're against it.
[01:21:42.851 --> 01:21:47.832]  But if they only make it about one group, like Hitler did with the Jews, see, oh, it's just the conservatives.
[01:21:48.592 --> 01:21:49.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:50.712 --> 01:21:51.633]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.113 --> 01:21:53.633]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.645 --> 01:21:57.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.788 --> 01:22:02.028]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:07.410]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:22:07.671 --> 01:22:12.292]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:22:12.693 --> 01:22:17.755]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:22:18.255 --> 01:22:22.937]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:22:23.476 --> 01:22:30.400]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.481]  And here's the best part.
[01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:38.085]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:22:38.405 --> 01:22:41.247]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:41.587 --> 01:22:44.729]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:22:44.749 --> 01:22:44.929]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:57.133]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:22:57.433 --> 01:22:59.875]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:06.481]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:13.967]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:14.568 --> 01:23:20.733]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:21.133 --> 01:23:22.974]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:23.114 --> 01:23:25.536]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:25.616 --> 01:23:36.562]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:37.182 --> 01:23:38.483]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:38.863 --> 01:23:40.244]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:46.948]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:47.617 --> 01:23:55.385]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:55.885 --> 01:23:57.026]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:57.467 --> 01:23:58.668]  The people strike back!
[01:24:00.552 --> 01:24:03.493]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:24:03.653 --> 01:24:08.914]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:14.535]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:24:14.895 --> 01:24:16.016]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:24:16.376 --> 01:24:25.378]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:24:25.678 --> 01:24:27.320]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.705]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:24:31.745 --> 01:24:36.370]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:24:36.751 --> 01:24:39.114]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:24:40.595 --> 01:24:41.355]  Keep it natural.
[01:24:41.675 --> 01:24:49.837]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:24:50.078 --> 01:24:54.119]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:24:54.139 --> 01:24:55.299]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:25:12.009 --> 01:25:23.216]  Alright, we're going to your calls right now.
[01:25:23.356 --> 01:25:26.457]  I just want to add a final point.
[01:25:26.778 --> 01:25:35.943]  That previously, people were called leaders or statesmen.
[01:25:37.418 --> 01:25:44.285]  And they were judged by, were they keeping the man, the tyrants off people's backs, were they allowing property rights and freedom.
[01:25:45.427 --> 01:25:50.131]  It wasn't a left-right debate, it was tyranny versus liberty.
[01:25:50.172 --> 01:25:51.313]  That was always the discussion.
[01:25:51.673 --> 01:25:55.677]  So they gave us the false political paradigm so they could break down our society and control us.
[01:25:56.218 --> 01:25:58.640]  Politicians at the mid-level and higher level
[01:25:59.887 --> 01:26:07.330]  are there to lie and deceive and to continually trick the people into never getting control of their society again.
[01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:10.451]  They are there to keep the elites in power.
[01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:14.273]  They are there for the upper class to wage war against the middle class and the working class.
[01:26:14.933 --> 01:26:21.076]  And they write textbooks on it, they brag about it all day, and that's why Rick Perry's coming out to be the Tea Party leader.
[01:26:21.736 --> 01:26:25.638]  They want to make it Republican so that they can manage dissent.
[01:26:27.165 --> 01:26:28.586]  And then play it off against the left.
[01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:31.248]  It's the two parties teamed up against the people.
[01:26:32.269 --> 01:26:33.931]  Two wings on the same bird of prey.
[01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:42.278]  Instead of looking at the wings all day, let's talk about the head, the beak, the guts of this thing, it's mind, it's eyes, what it believes, what this bird does.
[01:26:42.918 --> 01:26:43.619]  This is tyranny.
[01:26:44.479 --> 01:26:47.101]  This is a group of polycentric plutocrats
[01:26:48.496 --> 01:26:50.477]  Financiers, this is what globalism is.
[01:26:50.537 --> 01:27:09.804]  They've now announced a Bank of the World, a world government that will set your interest rates and the currency rates and that will set taxes worldwide and have an army and a global regulatory system through the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the Ex-Im Bank, the World Trade Organization, the Hague and the Netherlands.
[01:27:09.864 --> 01:27:11.085]  It's here and they're now announcing.
[01:27:11.465 --> 01:27:12.405]  We want a new world order?
[01:27:12.625 --> 01:27:16.907]  It's the banks that engineered the collapse ruling you with you paying a carbon tax to them.
[01:27:18.336 --> 01:27:20.438]  And that's why they've engineered the financial collapse by design.
[01:27:21.279 --> 01:27:22.240]  And they're bragging about it!
[01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:29.227]  And for decades, while they were building this, they said it didn't exist, and then exactly what we said they were going to unveil is what they've now unveiled!
[01:27:29.487 --> 01:27:32.169]  Because we were reading trilateral commission and CFR documents!
[01:27:33.063 --> 01:27:38.006]  I mean, the CFR came out last year and admitted they're doing chemtrails spraying, altering the atmosphere.
[01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:40.408]  Well, I don't need the CFR to tell me they're doing that.
[01:27:40.808 --> 01:27:54.397]  Suddenly, you look at the jet trails, they don't fade out in 30 seconds anymore, they hang there for hours and create whole cloud banks, and I interview the father of weather weapons, and, you know, we talk about all that, and then now they admit they're manipulating our atmosphere, but they say it's secret.
[01:27:55.178 --> 01:27:57.920]  Folks, what we know is off-the-chart crazy.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.381]  Imagine what we don't know.
[01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:03.203]  People say, well, if just 10% of what Alex says is true, we're in deep trouble.
[01:28:03.463 --> 01:28:05.485]  Folks, it's 100% and then some.
[01:28:06.166 --> 01:28:10.349]  I mean, every case it turns out being worse than I first thought.
[01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:13.592]  Because truth is strange, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:13.972 --> 01:28:17.275]  And I go back to what I said earlier, and I keep bringing this up, this is one of the well-known cases.
[01:28:18.155 --> 01:28:20.497]  They took 4,000 plus U.S.
[01:28:20.537 --> 01:28:27.043]  foster children from the 40s to the early 60s, put them in radiation chambers to test radiation on them and killed them.
[01:28:27.932 --> 01:28:38.856]  Now, if 40 years ago they had government people ready to assembly line kill kids, what are you doing trusting their vaccines?
[01:28:38.896 --> 01:28:40.837]  What are you doing trusting anything these criminals say?
[01:28:41.477 --> 01:28:42.637]  They're eugenicists.
[01:28:43.358 --> 01:28:45.238]  They believe in destroying economies.
[01:28:45.298 --> 01:28:46.019]  They want to hurt us.
[01:28:46.039 --> 01:28:47.239]  They believe we're living too well.
[01:28:47.539 --> 01:28:48.700]  They're Malthusian.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.760]  They say they are.
[01:28:51.567 --> 01:28:52.507]  So I made my point.
[01:28:53.128 --> 01:28:55.749]  We need to get it out that the Tea Parties aren't left-wing or right-wing.
[01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:57.589]  They're populist against the corrupt bankers.
[01:28:57.609 --> 01:28:58.510]  They're against crime.
[01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:59.530]  They're anti-corruption.
[01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:04.292]  That's what the bankers are, who are taking the crisis they've created and leveraging it into total control.
[01:29:05.192 --> 01:29:13.676]  And that these memos and documents are spying on mainline churches, mainline liberal groups, mainline conservative groups, libertarians.
[01:29:16.001 --> 01:29:18.204]  And that it's being done across the board.
[01:29:18.485 --> 01:29:27.719]  And that all the powers, the Patriot Act, and the Military Commissions Act, and the John Warner Defense Authorization, PDD 51, it's all being used against the American people!
[01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:31.570]  We told you that was what it was being set up for!
[01:29:31.811 --> 01:29:38.032]  The whole attack pattern, the whole architecture of the federalization of police, all of this, was meant for the general public!
[01:29:38.052 --> 01:29:38.932]  They said it was!
[01:29:39.352 --> 01:29:47.674]  And I kept screaming bloody murder, and now they're unveiling it, and conditioning you to get ready to have literal secret police on your street corners, telling you what to do.
[01:29:48.674 --> 01:29:50.075]  And they got armies of them!
[01:29:50.195 --> 01:29:52.375]  CIA, FBI recruiting ads everywhere.
[01:29:52.655 --> 01:29:57.236]  They're tripling the size of the ground force of the CIA, turning them loose on the cities of America.
[01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:58.917]  We've got our own Stasi now?
[01:30:00.509 --> 01:30:05.051]  And all these other agencies and groups, I mean, but it doesn't intimidate me, it makes me want to fight back.
[01:30:05.992 --> 01:30:12.816]  It makes me go, you know what, you criminals, we're not going to let foreign bankers set up secret police and then intimidate us to shut up.
[01:30:15.917 --> 01:30:17.838]  We're going to take this country back and bring it to justice.
[01:30:17.938 --> 01:30:24.922]  And you know what, so this doesn't happen again in this country, we need to go ahead and arrest these people that have violated the law, even their servants.
[01:30:24.942 --> 01:30:29.044]  We need to have grand juries indict you, we need to send your ass to prison.
[01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:30.924]  French there.
[01:30:32.345 --> 01:30:34.807]  Because this isn't a game, folks.
[01:30:36.468 --> 01:30:39.670]  Putting congressmen they don't like on no-fly list and they can't get off.
[01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:42.332]  And they got over a million, one hundred thousand Americans on it.
[01:30:42.592 --> 01:30:46.355]  They've had federal marshals quit and say they're ordered to put innocent people on these.
[01:30:48.186 --> 01:30:57.293]  Now they're talking about if you haven't paid your taxes, they're gonna turn your driver's license off, and they got scanners that are scanning your license plate, knowing if your insurance and your driver's license is up to date.
[01:30:57.513 --> 01:30:59.354]  You're like, oh good, stop the illegal aliens.
[01:30:59.494 --> 01:30:59.735]  Uh-uh.
[01:31:00.015 --> 01:31:01.036]  That's for you.
[01:31:01.396 --> 01:31:02.757]  That's for the American people.
[01:31:03.117 --> 01:31:05.659]  This system is coming out right now.
[01:31:08.181 --> 01:31:09.422]  All designed by the Pentagon.
[01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:13.545]  Okay, let's go ahead and take calls here.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.341]  Let's talk to Rachel in California.
[01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:19.401]  You're on the air, Rachel.
[01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:22.342]  Hello, Rachel.
[01:31:22.742 --> 01:31:23.003]  Yes.
[01:31:23.883 --> 01:31:24.083]  Hi.
[01:31:24.583 --> 01:31:27.724]  I just had one quick comment and then a question about Obama.
[01:31:29.285 --> 01:31:34.607]  My comment is, have you ever seen the movie Changeling with Angelina Jolie?
[01:31:35.507 --> 01:31:36.928]  No, I'm not a big fan of her.
[01:31:37.348 --> 01:31:40.789]  I'm not either, but that movie is based on a true story.
[01:31:40.809 --> 01:31:41.489]  It's really good.
[01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:45.431]  John Malkovich is in it, and his character reminds me of you totally.
[01:31:46.115 --> 01:31:50.697]  And I just want to recommend that you see that movie.
[01:31:50.978 --> 01:31:57.401]  I mean, by not being a big fan of Angelina Jolie, I'm just not into like, you know, video game remake movies and stuff.
[01:31:57.421 --> 01:31:58.421]  Well, no, it's a true story.
[01:31:58.902 --> 01:31:59.722]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:00.222 --> 01:32:01.483]  I know I just wanted to be specific.
[01:32:02.463 --> 01:32:06.726]  I happen to know that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, I talk to people in Hollywood, are all into this stuff.
[01:32:07.066 --> 01:32:10.287]  But I was told that five years ago, and then separately,
[01:32:11.647 --> 01:32:16.350]  I see you're part of the CFR pushing all this, so it's really weird, but what is Changeling about?
[01:32:17.651 --> 01:32:28.038]  It's about the chicken coop murders in California back in the 1930s, I believe, and the really corrupt LAPD.
[01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:32.880]  It's right up your alley.
[01:32:34.261 --> 01:32:35.621]  Interesting, maybe I'll check it out.
[01:32:36.082 --> 01:32:58.514]  Yeah, and my question about Obama is, you said a few months back something, I don't know the exact quote, I was wondering if you could tell me the exact quote, that he said something about older people shouldn't get, they're not supposed to get better, or something about health care, they're not supposed to... Let me think of the, there was a bunch of articles, let me think of the best one.
[01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:07.554]  Google, guys, Dr. Obama Bloomberg.
[01:33:08.856 --> 01:33:13.685]  And they have quotes in there by the guy he was going to have
[01:33:14.969 --> 01:33:18.613]  Head up Health and Human Services, who's bought and paid for by the big insurance companies.
[01:33:20.075 --> 01:33:22.277]  But he's the liberal with left cover, so it's okay.
[01:33:22.938 --> 01:33:31.807]  The senator from the Dakotas, Tom Daschle, who then had to step down for not paying taxes and having free limos and things given to him as part of money laundering.
[01:33:33.683 --> 01:33:39.329]  And in his book, and he was the architect of the current bill, he said, look, if you're going blind, you're supposed to go blind.
[01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:40.530]  If you're old, you're supposed to die.
[01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:44.634]  And we want the British model of rationing.
[01:33:46.075 --> 01:33:50.599]  And so I pulled up Bloomberg that had the quotes.
[01:33:50.619 --> 01:33:56.946]  It says, healthcare reform will not be pain-free, services should be more
[01:33:58.934 --> 01:33:59.555]  Accepting.
[01:34:00.255 --> 01:34:00.736]  Print it for me.
[01:34:00.776 --> 01:34:02.618]  I can't read it across the room with that small print.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.285]  Yeah, print me that Bloomberg article, but also show them a headline from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:12.727]  That's what I love about this being TV, too.
[01:34:12.767 --> 01:34:13.928]  I don't just read the headline.
[01:34:14.269 --> 01:34:16.291]  They can just, boom, slap it up there and you can read it.
[01:34:17.011 --> 01:34:22.536]  So, in the stimulus package, they got the socialized health care passed to federalize it.
[01:34:23.197 --> 01:34:25.580]  And so you're going to get like an aspirin for a heart attack.
[01:34:26.882 --> 01:34:28.864]  And you're going to get Prozac if your back's broken.
[01:34:28.884 --> 01:34:30.506]  I mean, this is what they do to the troops at the VA.
[01:34:31.007 --> 01:34:33.530]  Yeah, ruin your health with the Obama stimulus plan.
[01:34:34.371 --> 01:34:35.412]  Betsy McCauley.
[01:34:35.752 --> 01:34:37.354]  There was another one about Dr. Obama.
[01:34:37.374 --> 01:34:38.495]  Maybe that was the Wall Street Journal.
[01:34:39.881 --> 01:34:56.392]  But it says in there with their bioethicist boards that, yeah, I mean, I've seen Tony Blair on the House of Commons, and it's not just in their documents, when he was Prime Minister in England, admit you have to wait 18 months for brain surgery for a tumor that's operable, but kills you in six months.
[01:34:57.293 --> 01:35:01.235]  And they look at it and do an average, and if you're above 45, they just say, sorry, you're dead.
[01:35:03.437 --> 01:35:05.739]  And so the British, with money, fly over here.
[01:35:06.858 --> 01:35:08.419]  And so that's how it works.
[01:35:09.459 --> 01:35:11.080]  It's like having the worst HMO.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.922]  It's like buying that insurance that doesn't work anywhere.
[01:35:16.463 --> 01:35:20.825]  And then it also has the federal computers telling the doctors what tests they can give.
[01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:23.367]  So it's the insurance companies running everything.
[01:35:23.967 --> 01:35:29.610]  And then their socialism will be taking all our tax money, giving it to private insurance companies to rape us.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.720]  So there you have it.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:33.961]  Does that answer your question, Rachel?
[01:35:34.081 --> 01:35:34.821]  Yeah.
[01:35:34.841 --> 01:35:35.481]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:35:35.501 --> 01:35:36.302]  Go to the next caller.
[01:35:36.342 --> 01:35:36.802]  Thank you.
[01:35:38.062 --> 01:35:41.963]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cheryl in Winnipeg.
[01:35:42.764 --> 01:35:43.104]  Go ahead.
[01:35:43.124 --> 01:35:43.664]  You're on the air.
[01:35:45.124 --> 01:35:46.425]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:35:46.485 --> 01:35:52.747]  It's been about three weeks since I started listening to you and I finally got the nerve to call you.
[01:35:52.767 --> 01:35:57.268]  I thought maybe you'd like a Canadian perspective on the world order.
[01:35:57.688 --> 01:36:00.289]  Perhaps you guys should know what's going on over here.
[01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:03.452]  I know what's going on.
[01:36:03.492 --> 01:36:05.992]  The Queen publicly announced she rules Parliament.
[01:36:06.273 --> 01:36:10.394]  When Parliament didn't follow her orders, she activated the Governor General and completely rules everything.
[01:36:10.974 --> 01:36:11.634]  Oh, whatever.
[01:36:12.034 --> 01:36:12.975]  Her head's on her money.
[01:36:13.235 --> 01:36:13.695]  I mean that.
[01:36:13.795 --> 01:36:14.115]  There you go.
[01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.956]  No, I know, but then the Canadians are in denial.
[01:36:16.156 --> 01:36:17.136]  They go, oh no, she doesn't.
[01:36:17.376 --> 01:36:18.997]  I go, oh, here's Reuters with her ruling you.
[01:36:19.297 --> 01:36:20.517]  Oh, I know, but we need to be ruled.
[01:36:20.597 --> 01:36:22.238]  I mean, it's, you know, the Queen's good.
[01:36:22.258 --> 01:36:22.798]  I like her.
[01:36:23.098 --> 01:36:23.698]  Anyways, go ahead.
[01:36:24.318 --> 01:36:26.839]  Denial is way farther than that, sir.
[01:36:27.319 --> 01:36:29.240]  I'll give you an idea of where I live.
[01:36:30.305 --> 01:36:32.006]  Winnipeg is a really, really small place.
[01:36:32.026 --> 01:36:34.367]  We're the center of the country and the center of the continent.
[01:36:35.388 --> 01:36:39.550]  And here we have a level 5 virology lab and NORAD.
[01:36:41.488 --> 01:36:42.308]  In our city limits.
[01:36:42.529 --> 01:36:43.929]  No, I know they already merged your mill.
[01:36:43.969 --> 01:36:45.570]  And people say Canada won't be taken over.
[01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:47.471]  Canada's already merged into NORTHCOM.
[01:36:47.491 --> 01:36:50.332]  The North American Union's already set up.
[01:36:50.453 --> 01:36:54.435]  November 24th, 2005, all publicly announced.
[01:36:54.455 --> 01:36:55.695]  The documents are all public.
[01:36:55.715 --> 01:36:59.297]  And the general public just sucks their thumb and giggles and gobbles more Prozac.
[01:36:59.597 --> 01:37:01.978]  Well, it's because everything is just operating fine here.
[01:37:01.998 --> 01:37:04.280]  We don't have a big economic thing happening here.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.162]  It's a little bit, but your president came here and told us we're doing okay.
[01:37:09.402 --> 01:37:11.043]  We're doing better than you guys, they say.
[01:37:11.697 --> 01:37:16.761]  So, but we have a division of the FBI on our streets.
[01:37:17.402 --> 01:37:20.224]  We have a division of the DEA on our streets.
[01:37:21.585 --> 01:37:23.386]  Oh, you're already completely merged.
[01:37:24.147 --> 01:37:28.510]  It's total integration, and they've got to integrate us with Mexico, so they've got to collapse it first.
[01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:31.953]  They know the drug war is what's causing all the violence and death.
[01:37:31.973 --> 01:37:35.576]  They have a total gun ban down there, but their answer is, keep the drug war going.
[01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:36.377]  We have double the
[01:37:37.077 --> 01:37:44.899]  Uh, cocaine tripled to heroin than we had 15 years ago, more people in prison than ever, total carnage, and their answer is, keep prohibition going!
[01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:47.839]  It sure helped the mafia triple in size in the U.S.
[01:37:48.179 --> 01:37:50.180]  They're in prohibition, keep it going forever!
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:50.860]  Forever!
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.701]  It's wonderful, because they know the breakdown of society gives them more control.
[01:37:55.501 --> 01:38:02.602]  Well, let me tell you, see, something that you've been saying recent, as of recent, has been bothering me, and we don't have a total gun ban.
[01:38:02.622 --> 01:38:04.803]  We have an aboriginal population that is huge.
[01:38:05.845 --> 01:38:08.027]  And they have inherent rights to hold guns.
[01:38:08.307 --> 01:38:10.348]  Now, I wasn't saying you have a total gun ban.
[01:38:11.049 --> 01:38:15.492]  I said they registered your guns and then began, what, banning about half of them the next year.
[01:38:15.833 --> 01:38:20.696]  Germany first got them registered and then restricted and now is moving to ban.
[01:38:21.277 --> 01:38:23.818]  And Australia, England has a total gun ban.
[01:38:23.879 --> 01:38:26.040]  So you're midway through the steps.
[01:38:26.721 --> 01:38:30.984]  Well, they're frightened of our aboriginal population, which brings me to what you've been saying.
[01:38:31.024 --> 01:38:35.107]  You've been predicting that there'll be more terrorist acts in your country.
[01:38:35.874 --> 01:38:39.257]  I believe you've got the right operation, but the wrong country, sir.
[01:38:39.297 --> 01:38:44.622]  They've got to get Canadians on board with this thing, so pick your city.
[01:38:45.223 --> 01:38:45.503]  You know?
[01:38:46.564 --> 01:38:47.986]  And that's what I think.
[01:38:48.226 --> 01:38:57.735]  And the G20 a few weeks ago, or last week when you were talking about it, what they're speaking about, I believe, is the weaponization of space.
[01:38:58.442 --> 01:38:59.663]  Well, that's part of it.
[01:38:59.743 --> 01:39:01.824]  No, no, that's part of it, and I appreciate your call.
[01:39:01.844 --> 01:39:05.765]  They're also having another G20, and they're already issuing a new global currency.
[01:39:06.586 --> 01:39:07.766]  It's just bank to bank.
[01:39:07.806 --> 01:39:10.347]  It's digital transfers, the quantitative easing.
[01:39:10.447 --> 01:39:12.448]  They admit there's already a global currency.
[01:39:13.488 --> 01:39:17.730]  And China and others, New York Times reported, are beginning to dump the dollar.
[01:39:18.251 --> 01:39:19.811]  And all we've got left is the dollar, folks.
[01:39:19.851 --> 01:39:23.193]  When it's gone, then the hyperinflation starts.
[01:39:23.513 --> 01:39:25.894]  Right now we're in a depression, but
[01:39:26.826 --> 01:39:29.113]  There's been $12.8 trillion.
[01:39:29.153 --> 01:39:30.919]  That's the entire GDP.
[01:39:32.002 --> 01:39:32.905]  Imagine if they gave $12.8 trillion.
[01:39:34.839 --> 01:39:39.402]  8 trillion would have paid off all the mortgages in the country, not just bad mortgages, all the mortgages in the country paid off.
[01:39:39.422 --> 01:39:43.004]  12.8 trillion went to offshore bankers.
[01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:46.085]  But notice you're not seeing inflation, you're seeing deflation.
[01:39:46.565 --> 01:39:52.509]  But then in a year, two, all the economists agree, then it's going to just explode.
[01:39:52.769 --> 01:39:58.932]  But right now they've got to keep inflation down so that money has value for the private banking families to buy up real assets.
[01:39:59.553 --> 01:40:01.514]  And then when they're done, they're going to drop the hammer.
[01:40:01.894 --> 01:40:03.555]  And it is going to be devastating.
[01:40:04.335 --> 01:40:13.623]  Most people listening right now who are middle class will be destitute and poor for the rest of your lives just like Iceland, just like Argentina in the IMF and World Bank documents.
[01:40:15.284 --> 01:40:17.786]  The greatest form of bondage is just to make you totally poor.
[01:40:19.067 --> 01:40:24.632]  And then they'll put little liberal and conservative puppets up in front of you all day and get you all obsessed with that while they just keep
[01:40:25.799 --> 01:40:28.540]  Just punching you, punching you, bragging about it.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.980]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.141]  Lisa, you're on the air from Ohio.
[01:40:33.181 --> 01:40:33.861]  Welcome, Lisa.
[01:40:35.182 --> 01:40:35.982]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:36.742 --> 01:40:53.907]  I'm a first-time caller, and I'm kind of new at this game, but I live in the city of Cincinnati, and over the weekend and earlier in the week, we were having a problem with our broadcast stations being butted in on.
[01:40:55.086 --> 01:40:59.009]  And it wasn't the normal emergency broadcast system test.
[01:41:00.289 --> 01:41:14.799]  This happened to me Saturday night when I was watching the Ten Commandments and a blue screen come up with a white circle in it with a blue circle in the middle of that and some numbers on it.
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:23.785]  Monday night they interrupted the Cincinnati Reds game and it went to a totally different TV show.
[01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:40.265]  And then the next day, the broadcasters for the Reds were talking about it on the radio and saying it won't happen on the radio and Marty Brenneman, the Morton, said that and he got interrupted.
[01:41:41.626 --> 01:41:41.886]  Really?
[01:41:41.946 --> 01:41:42.806]  Right when he was saying it?
[01:41:43.667 --> 01:41:44.007]  Yeah.
[01:41:44.447 --> 01:41:45.748]  Yeah, well let me tell you what's going on.
[01:41:45.788 --> 01:41:47.409]  Let me tell you and then I'll hold you over.
[01:41:47.429 --> 01:41:48.150]  This is very important.
[01:41:49.048 --> 01:41:52.450]  Before, they said in the 50s, okay, the Russians are going to nuke us.
[01:41:53.130 --> 01:42:08.297]  By law, there's these big, powerful shortwave stations, and then there'll be an AM and FM repeater, and during an emergency broadcast alert, one big station per city, everybody is ordered to then dial over to that of a nukesitter or whatever.
[01:42:10.606 --> 01:42:14.247]  Then, they said, oh, Amber Alert in 96, they kidnapped a girl.
[01:42:14.567 --> 01:42:21.788]  We gotta put billboards up everywhere and be able to dial in with the EAS system, it's an all radio and TV, at the transmitter site.
[01:42:22.188 --> 01:42:30.250]  Everything is wired, lastly, through it, and then with special transmitter couplers, where it would take a day to even get a transmission out without it.
[01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:35.971]  So FEMA is in between all the radio, TV, cable, and the last line.
[01:42:36.411 --> 01:42:36.771]  And then they...
[01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:38.692]  Because I've worked at stations.
[01:42:38.712 --> 01:42:42.535]  I remember I was at 1260 filling in for some local hosts there on top of my syndicated show.
[01:42:42.655 --> 01:42:45.698]  They were carrying my syndicated over there if they went to sports here in Austin.
[01:42:47.259 --> 01:42:50.742]  And, uh, I was talking to their engineer and he's going, look at this.
[01:42:51.062 --> 01:42:59.149]  They're telling us in the next few years, this is four years ago, they're going to start just taking government time whenever they want and overriding us.
[01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.850]  So it's coming.
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.444]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[01:43:04.605 --> 01:43:09.330]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:12.213]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[01:43:12.373 --> 01:43:16.638]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[01:43:16.838 --> 01:43:19.461]  Every three seconds, someone's identity is stolen.
[01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:25.767]  It's not just the money that's being stolen, it's your reputation, your credits, and your valuable time to fix the huge mess.
[01:43:25.987 --> 01:43:29.311]  At LifeLock, we aim to prevent identity theft before it happens.
[01:43:29.511 --> 01:43:36.518]  And if anything happens while you're a client of LifeLock, you'll be protected by our exclusive $1,000,000 total service guarantee.
[01:43:36.558 --> 01:43:40.722]  With LifeLock, you'll also see a huge reduction in junk mail and pre-approved credit offers.
[01:43:40.762 --> 01:43:43.705]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:07.231 --> 01:44:12.594]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:13.114 --> 01:44:19.298]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:19.618 --> 01:44:21.419]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:21.579 --> 01:44:23.980]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:34.926]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.491]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:38.891 --> 01:44:40.291]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:40.752 --> 01:44:47.094]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:47.654 --> 01:44:55.438]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:55.918 --> 01:44:57.078]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:57.498 --> 01:44:58.679]  The people strike back.
[01:45:00.603 --> 01:45:02.025]  So you want to stop smoking?
[01:45:02.085 --> 01:45:03.186]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:45:03.366 --> 01:45:06.129]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:45:06.249 --> 01:45:10.073]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:45:10.233 --> 01:45:13.777]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:45:13.997 --> 01:45:15.959]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[01:45:16.019 --> 01:45:19.903]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[01:45:20.303 --> 01:45:27.087]  Smoke Free is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:35.391]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[01:45:35.791 --> 01:45:36.371]  I'm good.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:16.303]  You know, it's pretty simple.
[01:46:17.863 --> 01:46:21.124]  The military likes to take things over, run covert operations.
[01:46:21.204 --> 01:46:23.345]  They always take over countries they can get big in.
[01:46:23.365 --> 01:46:25.185]  Private banks own them.
[01:46:26.406 --> 01:46:28.066]  North Com's in control of the U.S.
[01:46:28.667 --> 01:46:31.567]  Sunshine Project got declassified documents in 2000.
[01:46:31.607 --> 01:46:32.468]  Every major city has
[01:46:34.329 --> 01:46:40.331]  Warehouses with helicopters with nerve gas and opiate knockout gases.
[01:46:41.011 --> 01:46:42.871]  This is mainstream news.
[01:46:42.891 --> 01:46:54.354]  Congress has this to spray the American people and the non-lethal spray they were saying would kill like 10% of the cities because it'll cause fires, wrecks, it instantly knocks you out.
[01:46:54.735 --> 01:46:56.215]  So they got helicopters ready.
[01:46:56.735 --> 01:46:58.456]  I mean, these people are criminals, folks.
[01:46:58.956 --> 01:46:59.976]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:47:01.837 --> 01:47:08.543]  The only way this can be stopped is if the police and military wake up, and that's why they're the main threat in all these MIAC reports.
[01:47:09.044 --> 01:47:10.926]  That's why there will be a purge of you first.
[01:47:11.426 --> 01:47:14.829]  After they march you out to have war with us, then you're going to wake up, then they're going to kill you.
[01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:18.392]  And I know you're not going to listen until it happens, so have it your way.
[01:47:18.433 --> 01:47:18.613]  Fine.
[01:47:19.404 --> 01:47:21.045]  Uh, you want to be slaves to foreign bankers?
[01:47:21.065 --> 01:47:22.926]  I mean, you want it to happen when it happened in Russia?
[01:47:22.946 --> 01:47:26.088]  Then we're going to go back to, uh, at least in a minute.
[01:47:26.128 --> 01:47:29.530]  Last caller we have time for, but Burmese will be back live at 9, 9 and midnight.
[01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:30.490]  I may pop in again.
[01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:33.732]  My solar backup, a lot of things can cut off here.
[01:47:33.752 --> 01:47:35.813]  Electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[01:47:36.214 --> 01:47:37.815]  Blizzard should move towards getting off the grid.
[01:47:37.835 --> 01:47:39.896]  Here's a good way to do just that, a solar powered generator.
[01:47:40.336 --> 01:47:43.379]  It's not controlled by FEMA or their EAS takeover system yet.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.345]  They have their power source 1800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster.
[01:47:48.665 --> 01:47:54.532]  Power source 1800, power plant, high efficiency solar panel, designed to provide endless electricity through its battery system.
[01:47:55.393 --> 01:47:58.515]  And the solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:47:58.895 --> 01:48:01.537]  It's the perfect emergency backup in troubled times.
[01:48:01.997 --> 01:48:02.938]  Get off the grid, folks.
[01:48:02.978 --> 01:48:05.119]  MySolarBackup.com is a good way to start.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.001]  MySolarBackup.com 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:07.641]  And last but not least,
[01:48:15.265 --> 01:48:21.931]  Before we go back to this final caller, Pepperspray.com, they have got the best prices on self-defense, folks.
[01:48:22.011 --> 01:48:27.896]  And if you're not going to get your daughter or wife a gun and training to protect themselves from all the crime that's expanding, at least get them a taser.
[01:48:28.636 --> 01:48:31.479]  Or at least get them a stun gun or some high-powered pepper spray.
[01:48:31.499 --> 01:48:32.460]  They've got great prices.
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:40.126]  Pepperspray.com, pepper spray of all kinds of strengths, stun guns and tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms.
[01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:41.307]  800-908-9988.
[01:48:41.327 --> 01:48:41.687]  800-908-9988.
[01:48:43.689 --> 01:48:47.371]  That's Pepperspray.com.
[01:48:47.391 --> 01:48:47.671]  1-800-908-9988.
[01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:52.834]  Thanks to our sponsors also for making this show possible.
[01:48:52.854 --> 01:48:53.835]  We really appreciate them.
[01:48:54.255 --> 01:48:56.717]  We appreciate listeners continuing to spread the word about the show.
[01:48:57.077 --> 01:48:58.718]  That's how we continue to reach more and more people.
[01:48:59.617 --> 01:49:01.739]  Okay, Lisa, I could talk for 10 hours about this.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:07.583]  They're now telling broadcasters, oh, the government's going to pop in with announcements from time to time.
[01:49:07.603 --> 01:49:10.305]  And it's, oh, there's a tornado coming with the locals.
[01:49:10.345 --> 01:49:12.907]  Or, oh, a girl in another state got kidnapped.
[01:49:13.228 --> 01:49:15.769]  An old woman's driving a black El Camino this year.
[01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:17.311]  And you see billboards.
[01:49:18.131 --> 01:49:20.293]  There's an Alzheimer's patient from Dallas.
[01:49:20.313 --> 01:49:22.154]  You see this in Austin, driving down 290 right here.
[01:49:23.075 --> 01:49:25.876]  But then you suddenly see, oh, 1-800-REPORT-TERROR!
[01:49:26.356 --> 01:49:28.297]  Oh, 1-800-REPORT-GUNS!
[01:49:28.317 --> 01:49:37.461]  And then your carpet cleaner's at your house and sees a gun case and thinks they're illegal, because, you know, they watch TV shows based in New York where guns are illegal, and then they call the cops on you.
[01:49:37.501 --> 01:49:41.183]  And the cops are, well, they're not illegal, but you got ten guns, we're gonna go ahead and arrest you.
[01:49:41.523 --> 01:49:41.623]  Oh!
[01:49:42.083 --> 01:49:42.723]  You resisted!
[01:49:43.484 --> 01:49:44.644]  Now you're charged with resisting!
[01:49:45.225 --> 01:49:46.765]  This is happening more and more.
[01:49:47.586 --> 01:49:49.286]  But all the police aren't evil, so they're trying.
[01:49:49.566 --> 01:49:50.767]  Lisa, does that answer your question?
[01:49:52.205 --> 01:49:58.671]  Yeah, because some of our local morning radio hosts were concerned about it.
[01:49:59.512 --> 01:50:08.901]  And I guess they did a little digging and were told that some foreign countries
[01:50:09.878 --> 01:50:11.799]  We're breaking in on our broadcast system.
[01:50:12.499 --> 01:50:13.520]  Oh my God, this is huge.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.380]  I saw a blurb.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:16.001]  It's not China, it's not Russia.
[01:50:16.261 --> 01:50:19.143]  They're trying to pass a bill for the feds to take over the internet.
[01:50:19.783 --> 01:50:21.884]  And Senator Rockefeller said they want to get rid of the web.
[01:50:22.104 --> 01:50:26.007]  So they're claiming the power to kill the web, that's New York Times, to save it.
[01:50:26.607 --> 01:50:28.208]  And what town are you in, in Ohio?
[01:50:29.295 --> 01:50:29.916]  Cincinnati.
[01:50:30.376 --> 01:50:34.640]  I was thinking that during the break that they were going to say it was the Chinese or something and it wasn't EAS.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.882]  Ma'am, that's EAS, that's FEMA.
[01:50:37.302 --> 01:50:38.343]  Alright, God bless you.
[01:50:38.383 --> 01:50:39.324]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:39.364 --> 01:50:40.245]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:40.265 --> 01:50:41.366]  Back to 9-9 at Midnight Live.
[01:50:41.947 --> 01:50:43.788]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:50:50.441 --> 01:50:52.003]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:52.123 --> 01:50:56.748]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:56.868 --> 01:50:59.631]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:59.832 --> 01:51:01.474]  DeliverUs.com!
[01:51:01.794 --> 01:51:02.695]  You have your own bread.
[01:51:02.875 --> 01:51:08.742]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:08.942 --> 01:51:11.884]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[01:51:12.185 --> 01:51:19.090]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:19.190 --> 01:51:22.313]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:22.453 --> 01:51:22.653]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
