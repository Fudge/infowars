[00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.372]  For the last hour and 52 minutes today, we're going to be joined by Lindsey Williams.
[00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:15.835]  Throughout the interview, I'm going to be covering different pieces of news in context to what he's discussing.
[00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:28.696]  Now, before we introduce Lindsey Williams, I want to cover several issues here today on this Monday, October 19, 2009 live edition.
[00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:41.107]  Now, I did the first two hours and five minutes of the radio show, just radio, but always the last two hours, sometimes more, we simulcast the live radio show in living color at
[00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:44.609]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:52.494]  For all the PrisonPlanet.TV members that are viewing the show right now, I want to welcome you.
[00:00:53.374 --> 00:01:02.660]  Also, my new film, Fall of the Republic, it is coming out very, very soon.
[00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.490]  We're about 48 hours away right now.
[00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.911]  It's coming out at 3 p.m.
[00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.792]  Central Time.
[00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:16.154]  And that is going to be this Wednesday, October 21st.
[00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:22.677]  In fact, we'll punch up on the screen the Yahoo page for Fall of the Republic.
[00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:35.683]  And I want to encourage all of the listeners to be part of this resistance against tyranny, to not procrastinate, to get the DVD, to make copies, to get it out to people.
[00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:44.785]  My other films, Endgame, Terror Storm, Obama Deception, the mainstream media have admitted they've been seen tens of millions of times, over 100 million times total that we know of.
[00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.206]  It has been devastating to the globalists.
[00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:52.555]  This film is a quantum leap in production quality, a quantum leap in the material.
[00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:59.521]  It shows who the globalists are, what their master plan is, and how we are going to stop these people.
[00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:12.212]  So again, you can click on InfoWars.com on the top banner, and it will take you to the shopping cart.
[00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.113]  Where you can get the DVD and then make copies of it.
[00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:21.216]  We want to have an explosion of DVDs on the street in the next week.
[00:02:21.557 --> 00:02:29.663]  We want to see an explosion at PrisonPlanet.tv of people downloading the film, burning it to disk, and giving it to people.
[00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:31.745]  Please take action.
[00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:35.248]  It is so vitally important that this happen.
[00:02:35.668 --> 00:02:39.331]  I have spent so much time and so much energy and so much treasure
[00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:50.376]  Getting this done, and I'm just begging you to get it and get it out to everyone, please.
[00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:53.099]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.201]  It's not even basically a pre-order now.
[00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:59.565]  I mean, ordering this now, it's starting to ship out tomorrow and Wednesday, so it's not even a pre-order.
[00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:11.704]  Animal simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv for members on Wednesday 3 p.m.
[00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:13.065]  First place you're going to see it.
[00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:20.569]  Please get the trailers that are on InfoWars.com by clicking on the Follow the Republic banner.
[00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.310]  Email them to your whole email list.
[00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.411]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.874]  And if you're not going to buy the DVD, if you're not going to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, that's fine.
[00:03:29.214 --> 00:03:32.195]  It will show up all over the internet by Thursday.
[00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:34.457]  We'll try to find the best
[00:03:35.436 --> 00:03:40.678]  Encode on YouTube that somebody with a director channel has and link to that.
[00:03:41.898 --> 00:03:46.719]  But we won't be able to make films of this caliber in the future unless we get the financial support.
[00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.821]  We got it with Obama deception, so I took the extra profits from that and upped the production quality on this.
[00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:54.521]  It's an even bigger gamble.
[00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:55.462]  I don't care.
[00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:59.643]  I'd give my life to stop the New World Order right now if I thought that was needed.
[00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:01.163]  I am committed.
[00:04:01.223 --> 00:04:03.264]  I know there's no future unless we do this.
[00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:09.104]  But YouTube isn't crisp and clear.
[00:04:09.264 --> 00:04:10.024]  It's getting a little bit better.
[00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:12.986]  PrisonPlanet.tv is.
[00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:15.288]  I mean, it is DVD quality.
[00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:19.590]  Now, if you don't have a super high-powered connection, that's okay.
[00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:28.176]  We've got it in super high quality, high quality, medium quality, and then even the small file looks a lot better than YouTube and Google.
[00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:34.460]  We got a DivX file that this time encoded better than our medium quality.
[00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:44.058]  So it's made for those that know this stuff to be able to put it on regular computer disc and almost all new DVD players last few years play DivX.
[00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:50.442]  So you can say, you can just give these 20-cent discs, it's not a DVD, it's a disc, a regular disc.
[00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:53.483]  You can give this to people and it'll play on most players.
[00:04:53.803 --> 00:05:00.447]  Just put a sticker on there or tell them, hey, if this doesn't play on yours, it's because you don't have a DivX DVD player.
[00:05:00.827 --> 00:05:01.908]  It'll play on your computer.
[00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:03.269]  The point is,
[00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:08.440]  PrisonPlanet.tv is an arsenal of resistance to this tyranny.
[00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:12.963]  And we want everybody to go get the $5.95 monthly membership.
[00:05:13.143 --> 00:05:14.203]  That pays for our bandwidth.
[00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:22.389]  You can share your passcode with six people, but if they share it, you won't be able to simultaneously get on.
[00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.973]  One passcode allows six computers to attach to it at one time.
[00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:29.954]  It's set at six right now, right?
[00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:31.095]  We had it set at nine.
[00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:32.115]  It was crashing our servers.
[00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:33.857]  Right, Matt?
[00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:37.279]  What is the server set at right now, guys?
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.664]  How many computers can I sign on?
[00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:43.068]  It is six, okay.
[00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:47.080]  Yeah, okay, that's why I was just double checking we hadn't changed it.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.504]  I told them turn it up to like 9 and it was, even with our big CDNs, it was too expensive.
[00:05:52.944 --> 00:05:55.746]  I have a $400,000 a year bandwidth bill.
[00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:56.967]  It's actually more than that.
[00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:03.792]  Listen, the issue here is, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm going to go to Lindsey Williams here, is that this is a big deal.
[00:06:03.852 --> 00:06:04.613]  This is important.
[00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:22.164]  Okay, I wanted to introduce Lindsey Williams with the fact that Bilderberg, in 2008, Jim Tucker and my sources as well, as well as Daniel Estlin, all reported that the Bilderberg group was planning to slash oil prices by at least half.
[00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:23.225]  That would have been $75.
[00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:33.305]  Lindsey Williams, who did work for Atlantic Richfield and other big oil companies as a high-level minister.
[00:06:33.465 --> 00:06:36.147]  He was a ground-level minister, but they brought him in to be part of the board meetings.
[00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:38.188]  That's pretty standard in many cases.
[00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:45.073]  And he heard them, when they found all the extra oil in Alaska, more than Saudi Arabia, he heard them say, we can't pump this out.
[00:06:45.413 --> 00:06:50.156]  That's now come out in the Associated Press 20 years after he broke it and wrote a best-selling book about it.
[00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:54.978]  So he's been confirmed, that's who we have on here, who's been confirmed over and over again.
[00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:57.259]  Who we can trust, who we know is accurate.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:06.684]  This 80 plus year old, I think he said 87 year old, former executive, I know who it is, what company, but I'm not at liberty to say.
[00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:12.426]  But the point is, there were several companies involved, three big ones, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:07:13.707 --> 00:07:15.988]  Because it was a joint deal, a lot of times a little company is a joint deal.
[00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:24.494]  Lindsey put out a video that was number one on Google off and on for about six months, so tens of millions of views conservatively.
[00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:28.958]  They called up and said, we're gonna kill you if you don't shut up.
[00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.141]  You were brought into this in confidence.
[00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:33.643]  Don't talk about how there's plenty of oil anymore.
[00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:40.010]  But the guy was dying, thought he was dying at the time, just like E. Howard Hunt went public.
[00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:48.323]  A year before he died, thinking he was going to die, and then right before he did die, admitting he ran the op to kill Kennedy.
[00:07:48.543 --> 00:07:49.844]  It's now declassified, basically.
[00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:55.269]  But the issue here is, he thought he was going to die and said, but here's what I can tell you.
[00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:57.010]  Lindsey has now talked to him.
[00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:01.314]  He doesn't really like what's happening, but he's still a globalist.
[00:08:02.235 --> 00:08:05.437]  And the guy may die soon, so we may be able to, in the next year or so, give you his name.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.162]  Long as Lindsey sticks around and he's in great health.
[00:08:09.903 --> 00:08:12.004]  He's an old-timer himself.
[00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:13.426]  But enough of me.
[00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:20.451]  The point is, Lindsey said it's $150 a barrel right now, but he said within three months it's going to drop below $50.
[00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:21.892]  Everybody laughed at him.
[00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:25.115]  Because we just had for Bilderberg, they were going to cut it in half.
[00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:25.775]  That would have been down to $75.
[00:08:25.895 --> 00:08:27.797]  And that sounded insane.
[00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:32.128]  In fact, there's the Prison Planet article that we posted.
[00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:34.609]  Leaked agenda, Bilderberg Group plans economic depression.
[00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:38.111]  And in the article from May 6th is just the footnote.
[00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:42.113]  And somebody pointed out after Lindsey went public that we'd already put this intel out.
[00:08:42.413 --> 00:08:50.618]  So see, not only am I confirming what Lindsey said from his source, we separately already had this, but we weren't smart like Lindsey to make the prediction and point it out.
[00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:53.239]  This was just intel that we came up with.
[00:08:55.697 --> 00:09:01.582]  So, in fact, there it is, about the $150 a barrel, and just amazing.
[00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:04.804]  Oh, that's Watson reporting on our original report.
[00:09:04.824 --> 00:09:06.045]  Let me give you the original report.
[00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:07.366]  Here it is.
[00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:11.249]  Secret Bilderberg Agenda to Microchip Americans, and June 10, 2008.
[00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:14.311]  That's the original article that had it.
[00:09:14.632 --> 00:09:15.352]  So, that said,
[00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:23.749]  Lindsey Williams, we'll just get to the end of the show today, because I'm going to him later and I apologize.
[00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:26.971]  He is here with us, but the whole global agenda is unfolding.
[00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:31.014]  Now, oil went back up, but Lindsey said for at least a year.
[00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:38.239]  And for a year, it was on average at about $55, I've done the math, right around $55 a barrel, like he said.
[00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:41.041]  Now it's gone up to $76, $79 is the high earlier today.
[00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.353]  The trolls tried to discredit Lindsey saying, oh look, it went back up.
[00:09:48.653 --> 00:09:50.594]  No, his prediction was it would go down for a year.
[00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:54.077]  And it wasn't a prediction, it was he was told this by an insider.
[00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:57.639]  Lindsey, we're going to break in two minutes, but great to have you back with us.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.301]  You're breaking this news here.
[00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:00.562]  We're honored to have you.
[00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:05.265]  This guy spilt his guts, as you told me during the break, believing he may die any time.
[00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:08.588]  We're going to get even more from a high-level insider today.
[00:10:08.868 --> 00:10:09.929]  Thanks for breaking it here.
[00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:12.991]  Thank you, Alex, for allowing me the privilege
[00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:14.638]  of being on your show today.
[00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:19.900]  Alex, do you realize that this is the first radio talk show that I've done in three months?
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.162]  I have not done a single show with anybody in three months.
[00:10:24.702 --> 00:10:29.203]  Your producer called me back about two months ago and he said, uh, the price of crude oil is going up.
[00:10:29.643 --> 00:10:31.084]  Alex said, would you appear on the show?
[00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.205]  I said, would you please give me a rain check?
[00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:42.948]  I said, until I know what I'm talking about, until I have talked with the elite themselves and can tell you that I guarantee this is going to take place,
[00:10:43.556 --> 00:10:44.617]  I don't want to be on your show.
[00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:46.458]  I said, please give me a rain check.
[00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:49.861]  And when I know what I'm talking about instead of guessing, I'll be glad to be there.
[00:10:50.281 --> 00:11:00.109]  Alex Jones Show today is the first show I have appeared on in three months, and no one has ever heard the material that you're going to hear in a few minutes.
[00:11:00.189 --> 00:11:09.817]  Because when I got back from three months of being absent, one morning I felt, hey, I should pick up the telephone and call these people and ask them what they're doing.
[00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:10.577]  And I did.
[00:11:11.418 --> 00:11:12.379]  Just a few days ago,
[00:11:13.095 --> 00:11:13.956]  I picked up the phone.
[00:11:13.976 --> 00:11:16.258]  Sure enough, he answered the phone the first time around.
[00:11:16.278 --> 00:11:18.520]  He's over 85 years of age.
[00:11:18.981 --> 00:11:20.322]  He nearly died last winter.
[00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:21.043]  I didn't know that.
[00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:23.816]  Alex, he confessed everything.
[00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:38.722]  Have you ever thought about the fact that when a person is facing eternity, and everybody knows that graveyard's out there, you realize that even the elite themselves, when they're facing such circumstances as that, will oftentimes tell you things that they would never tell you otherwise.
[00:11:39.183 --> 00:11:46.866]  Charlotte Isserby's father was skull and bones and confessed and repented right before he died of cancer and cried his guts out.
[00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:48.207]  It's never too late.
[00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:49.447]  Just like the thief on the cross.
[00:11:49.847 --> 00:11:51.168]  Pastor, stay with us.
[00:11:51.448 --> 00:11:52.189]  We're coming right back.
[00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:54.530]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.471]  Spy on me?
[00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:55.831]  Yeah.
[00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:00.794]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:12:00.935 --> 00:12:02.396]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:03.196]  Startpage?
[00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:03.636]  Yeah.
[00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:04.697]  Startpage.com.
[00:12:04.817 --> 00:12:07.619]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:11.502]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:12:14.764 --> 00:12:17.125]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:18.866]  I'm adding Startpage to my browser.

[00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:53.947]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:12:54.147 --> 00:12:59.491]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:00.091]  I get it.
[00:13:00.232 --> 00:13:09.579]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.020]  That's not what's happening.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:19.507]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:13:19.727 --> 00:13:22.990]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.193]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:13:27.393 --> 00:13:28.955]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:32.217]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:36.541]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:37.462]  You should, too.
[00:13:37.642 --> 00:13:38.623]  Find out what they know.

[00:14:52.653 --> 00:14:56.276]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[00:14:56.396 --> 00:15:03.321]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:08.585]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:10.766]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:17.231]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[00:15:17.411 --> 00:15:22.194]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[00:15:22.374 --> 00:15:30.620]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:38.365]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[00:15:38.865 --> 00:15:39.306]  I think so.
[00:16:07.392 --> 00:16:08.913]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:16:08.933 --> 00:16:09.614]  to 3 p.m.
[00:16:09.654 --> 00:16:10.795]  Central Standard Time.
[00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:11.615]  We're here.
[00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:17.559]  Actor Lindsey lays out the new revelations he got from his Bilderberg group, Inside Source.
[00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:24.585]  I'm gonna go over the announcements that they may cancel the World Club Cup.
[00:16:25.413 --> 00:16:26.794]  Because of emissions.
[00:16:26.974 --> 00:16:32.298]  And they're saying they may ban air travel unless you get a government authorization.
[00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:37.822]  Folks, Schwarzeneggers announced they're banning above 40 inch televisions and gonna tax all the rest.
[00:16:39.223 --> 00:16:40.904]  The enemy is coming in like a flood.
[00:16:41.044 --> 00:16:42.886]  This is not a joke.
[00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.949]  Now, I'm gonna shut up in this segment and the next completely.
[00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:50.174]  Lindsey Williams, talk to me like I'm a five-year-old.
[00:16:50.474 --> 00:16:51.655]  We have a lot of new listeners.
[00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:52.675]  Give them the basics.
[00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:57.538]  This insider who almost died has now given you even more information.
[00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.879]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, you've got the floor.
[00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:01.920]  Alex, you're right.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.821]  This is not a joke.
[00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:06.282]  This man's confessed everything.
[00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:12.545]  Over 85 years of age, almost died last morning, and I have not talked to him for two years.
[00:17:13.197 --> 00:17:18.459]  And two years ago, he said the price of crude oil is going from $147 to $50 a barrel.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:25.243]  And everybody said, you're stupid, you're crazy, your credibility is going to be destroyed if you dare give out such frivolous information.
[00:17:25.823 --> 00:17:26.203]  I did.
[00:17:26.603 --> 00:17:30.825]  Three months later, because I have never found these individuals to be wrong.
[00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:32.126]  They know what they're doing.
[00:17:32.226 --> 00:17:33.266]  They know where they're going.
[00:17:33.706 --> 00:17:36.048]  Whenever they say it, you can believe it's going to happen.
[00:17:36.428 --> 00:17:37.668]  Wall Street couldn't take it.
[00:17:37.768 --> 00:17:39.089]  The OPEC couldn't handle it.
[00:17:39.589 --> 00:17:41.230]  And it went to $50 a barrel.
[00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.412]  In fact, it went down to $34 a barrel.
[00:17:43.432 --> 00:17:44.253]  It's going back up to $70.
[00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:47.255]  It's going to fluctuate back and forth in between there.
[00:17:47.755 --> 00:17:55.521]  And, Alex, when I told that, there was only one or two little old bitty radio talk shows that would dare even allow me on to tell something so stupid.
[00:17:56.062 --> 00:18:02.407]  And Wall Street, even some Wall Street people were laughing at me and saying, it'll so impact the world it couldn't possibly happen.
[00:18:02.447 --> 00:18:03.548]  But, Alex, it happened.
[00:18:03.588 --> 00:18:06.149]  Now, I said all of that to say this.
[00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.991]  This man confessed everything.
[00:18:08.607 --> 00:18:10.912]  He sees the graveyards are around the corner.
[00:18:11.337 --> 00:18:16.361]  And what you are about to hear this hour, this morning, is shocking.
[00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:20.624]  I was stunned when this individual told me this, and I'm still shaken.
[00:18:20.644 --> 00:18:22.966]  I mean, you're bound to hear it in my voice.
[00:18:23.307 --> 00:18:26.149]  Alex, I am so glad you're coming out with this new DVD.
[00:18:26.429 --> 00:18:29.772]  I haven't seen it yet since I just got back in the office the other day.
[00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.354]  I have not the slightest idea that you were putting this out.
[00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:38.719]  Folks, you've got to get Alex Jones' new DVD because when you hear what this elitist told me,
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.886]  Within the past few days, you're going to know that everything Alex Jones is saying to you is true.
[00:18:44.966 --> 00:18:46.828]  You have got to get his DVD.
[00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:51.073]  You must pass it out to 3 or 4 million people within the first week's time.
[00:18:51.593 --> 00:18:57.940]  Alex, I am congratulating you to no end for what you're saying.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.944]  Lindsey, I want to congratulate you, and hopefully later you're going to tell us about some media you put together to get your inside info out.
[00:19:04.265 --> 00:19:07.287]  But you said, he said, for at least one year it would go to 50.
[00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:11.190]  It went to actually 32 at its low one time.
[00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.431]  Stayed around 50 for the year, as you said.
[00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:14.692]  It's gone back up a bit now.
[00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:16.614]  What is going on?
[00:19:16.674 --> 00:19:17.895]  Give us the inside intel.
[00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:22.278]  Well, everything you said back then happened exactly like you said it.
[00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:29.530]  And everything that you're going to hear me say that he has said in the past few days is going to happen exactly like he says.
[00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.336]  You remember a number of years ago there was a man who wrote a book.
[00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:34.417]  His name was Quigley.
[00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:36.621]  It was entitled Tragedy and Hope.
[00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:39.606]  And it came to pass exactly as he said it.
[00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:43.227]  And when Quigley came out with the book, he was one of them.
[00:19:43.407 --> 00:19:45.288]  He was one of the elitists himself.
[00:19:45.828 --> 00:19:52.991]  And when he came out with the book, everybody said, quickly, nobody, why would you dare give out the secrets of the elite?
[00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.372]  And aren't you afraid giving that out?
[00:19:55.432 --> 00:19:57.893]  And Quigley responded, nobody's going to believe it anyway.
[00:19:58.273 --> 00:20:06.756]  Now I'm going to tell you up front right now, whenever I tell you the thing, and this is so different than anything you've ever heard before, this man gave me things.
[00:20:07.276 --> 00:20:08.196]  Hold on, hold on, Lindsey!
[00:20:23.962 --> 00:20:25.363]  Lindsey, you're starting to freak me out.
[00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:30.906]  You said 25 or longer ago there was oil all over Alaska.
[00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:31.866]  You were there.
[00:20:31.906 --> 00:20:32.947]  You said where it was at.
[00:20:33.007 --> 00:20:36.589]  They've now had to admit that and that they're holding those reserves.
[00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.890]  You wrote a bestselling book about that.
[00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:41.412]  Over and over again, what you've said has been accurate.
[00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:46.620]  But then what you said two years ago was stunningly accurate.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.922]  It was actually worse than what you said.
[00:20:48.322 --> 00:20:50.004]  Not to 50, but to 32.
[00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:53.849]  You're telling me now this is... I haven't heard this.
[00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.535]  Again, you just contacted us and said, I'm ready to tell you this.
[00:20:59.015 --> 00:21:00.477]  This guy thinks he may die.
[00:21:01.238 --> 00:21:04.259]  I mean, compared to last time, you're saying he spilt his guts.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.420]  So we're going to go on a break.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.081]  It's a 15-minute segment.
[00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:07.941]  It's actually longer than that.
[00:21:07.981 --> 00:21:09.182]  It's a 17-minute segment.
[00:21:09.662 --> 00:21:11.083]  You're going to have the complete floor.
[00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:16.405]  I want you to just roll through what he told you when we come back.
[00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:17.746]  Lindsey Williams, very honored.
[00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.066]  He's bragging this here.
[00:21:19.447 --> 00:21:24.649]  I have nothing but respect for Lindsey, and his information has always proven to be 100% dead on.
[00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.673]  And so I am very upset about what we're about to hear.
[00:21:29.693 --> 00:21:36.260]  I think I've got enough to imagine what it's going to be because I've got the documents right over here.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.945]  And just how deep does this rabbit hole go?
[00:21:41.325 --> 00:21:41.886]  We'll find out.
[00:21:42.547 --> 00:21:43.428]  We're on the march.
[00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.530]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:49.154]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:51.906 --> 00:22:01.730]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablu, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.411]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:04.331]  It's very real.
[00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:05.032]  I know.
[00:22:05.052 --> 00:22:08.893]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:22:09.273 --> 00:22:12.014]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[00:22:12.495 --> 00:22:15.536]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence.
[00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:20.718]  By ordering or own a Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business, just like I did.

[00:22:51.963 --> 00:22:57.130]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.616]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:01.796 --> 00:23:03.639]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:05.421]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:06.723]  There is a solution.
[00:23:06.963 --> 00:23:14.967]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:54.711]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:58.352]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:23:58.793 --> 00:24:03.155]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:08.958]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:24:09.258 --> 00:24:13.741]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:24:14.022 --> 00:24:17.084]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:24:17.644 --> 00:24:22.067]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:24:22.468 --> 00:24:28.752]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:30.974]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:24:31.454 --> 00:24:34.277]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[00:24:41.326 --> 00:24:41.366]  877-327-0365.
[00:24:41.386 --> 00:24:41.926]  Don't wait.
[00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:42.387]  Call today.
[00:25:04.196 --> 00:25:06.499]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.326]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[00:25:12.366 --> 00:25:14.409]  I'm eastbound, just one more bandit run.
[00:25:14.569 --> 00:25:19.154]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:22.138]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[00:25:23.614 --> 00:25:28.917]  I don't know how anybody could be bored.
[00:25:29.737 --> 00:25:38.922]  You thrill seekers out there, you're not going to find thrills bungee cord jumping or climbing mountains like you're going to find fighting tyranny.
[00:25:39.302 --> 00:25:44.925]  There's a whole war going on with the social engineers bringing in their planetary eugenics government.
[00:25:45.725 --> 00:25:47.666]  It's in all their documents, all their statements.
[00:25:47.686 --> 00:25:49.367]  I mean, I have Reuters right here.
[00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:50.768]  Today,
[00:25:52.017 --> 00:26:01.860]  Monday, October 19th saying they may ban people attending the World Cup because emissions are soaring and they can't have carbon tax.
[00:26:02.681 --> 00:26:03.441]  Look at this headline.
[00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:05.241]  World's future is being decided.
[00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:07.522]  We need to curtail air travel now.
[00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:08.863]  Curtail?
[00:26:08.943 --> 00:26:10.323]  I mean, listen!
[00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:12.564]  I've got the treaty.
[00:26:13.857 --> 00:26:16.558]  Farmers venturing into brave new world of carbon markets.
[00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:17.539]  Look at this!
[00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.720]  It's total takeover!
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.681]  And the British Lord calling for restricting air travel?
[00:26:21.961 --> 00:26:25.483]  He's the guy that owns the carbon credit rating industry.
[00:26:26.904 --> 00:26:27.484]  This guy.
[00:26:27.504 --> 00:26:31.607]  They don't tell you this in the article, but I have the article where he's the one that calls for that.
[00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:31.947]  Look at this.
[00:26:32.247 --> 00:26:34.268]  Stern launches credit rating agency.
[00:26:34.548 --> 00:26:35.229]  Lord Stern.
[00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:37.890]  They don't tell you that, though, when he writes for the Guardian.
[00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:39.431]  Look at this.
[00:26:39.951 --> 00:26:41.512]  Here is the Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:26:41.612 --> 00:26:43.233]  This is only two pages of a thousand.
[00:26:44.824 --> 00:26:47.625]  Point 38A, Global Government.
[00:26:47.645 --> 00:26:51.826]  I'm going to cover this later, but I'm going to shut up and go to Lindsey Williams.
[00:26:52.306 --> 00:26:55.907]  Lindsey, go ahead and launch into this now for me.
[00:26:56.587 --> 00:26:58.708]  Go ahead and get into this for me.
[00:26:59.428 --> 00:27:06.290]  Go ahead and just recap as much as you can tell us about this guy, the previous info, and get into the new info.
[00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.351]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, you've got the floor.
[00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:12.732]  A few days ago, now please folks, understand,
[00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.710]  This is not a year or two year ago information.
[00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:21.852]  A few days ago, when I got back in the office for the first time in over two months, I picked up the phone.
[00:27:22.312 --> 00:27:23.692]  He was very friendly.
[00:27:25.132 --> 00:27:25.912]  I was stunned.
[00:27:26.332 --> 00:27:29.133]  Now, I'm going to have to admit to you, I am still shaken.
[00:27:30.693 --> 00:27:35.154]  Immediately, the very first thing I did was pick up my phone and I called Kansas City.
[00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:39.595]  And I said, I'm hopping the next airplane and coming out there, you have your cameras ready.
[00:27:40.248 --> 00:27:51.616]  I went in studio, professional studio, did a multiple camera DVD, three of them, to about one hour, another one hour and a half.
[00:27:52.256 --> 00:27:54.097]  I have hired a new fulfillment house.
[00:27:54.257 --> 00:27:56.979]  Alex, I'm like you with your new DVD.
[00:27:57.019 --> 00:27:57.980]  You've got to get it out.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.582]  You've got to get it out to everybody you can as fast as you can.
[00:28:00.602 --> 00:28:04.845]  You're going to understand why whenever I get into this in a moment or two with what he actually said.
[00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:05.885]  I'm the same way.
[00:28:06.786 --> 00:28:08.207]  I got a new fulfillment house.
[00:28:08.946 --> 00:28:10.648]  I said, I want numbers off.
[00:28:10.668 --> 00:28:12.370]  We got seven operators standing by.
[00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.713]  They'll ship it within 24 hours.
[00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:18.277]  And I did three and a half hours of DVDs.
[00:28:18.457 --> 00:28:22.041]  It took me that long to explain everything that this man told me.
[00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:23.683]  Okay, we're going to plug the number.
[00:28:23.723 --> 00:28:27.127]  We're going to plug all the info, but, Lindsey, condense it down.
[00:28:27.247 --> 00:28:27.968]  What did he tell you?
[00:28:28.683 --> 00:28:29.623]  Okay, here we go.
[00:28:29.723 --> 00:28:34.945]  Folks, have your pencil and paper handy, because no one has access to this material.
[00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:37.665]  This is the first show I've ever given it on.
[00:28:38.105 --> 00:28:42.967]  You're the first one to know it, and you'll get it no other place on the face of the earth.
[00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:47.768]  Believe me, over 85 years of age, Nellie died last winter.
[00:28:49.447 --> 00:28:50.889]  Alex, okay, here we go.
[00:28:51.009 --> 00:28:51.389]  You ready?
[00:28:51.849 --> 00:28:56.874]  I'm just going to give you one statement after the other, and I'll elaborate on them somewhat as we go along.
[00:28:56.994 --> 00:28:57.715]  I'm ready.
[00:28:58.155 --> 00:29:00.337]  This is completely different, Alex.
[00:29:01.939 --> 00:29:03.860]  Most people haven't even thought about this yet.
[00:29:04.781 --> 00:29:10.186]  He said, within two years, you will not recognize America.
[00:29:10.686 --> 00:29:11.407]  Oh my goodness.
[00:29:12.288 --> 00:29:15.631]  When he said that, my mind went a thousand miles an hour.
[00:29:16.198 --> 00:29:24.384]  By the way, when I was in the studio the other day making these DVDs, the studio owner came in and he said, wait a minute, you can't put that in.
[00:29:24.425 --> 00:29:25.405]  He said, you cut that out.
[00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:28.648]  He said, it'd be too dangerous to even put that in in my studio.
[00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:30.042]  And we did.
[00:29:30.082 --> 00:29:33.084]  We cut one more segment out because he said you can't make that statement.
[00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:35.225]  He said he'll fall back on us as a studio.
[00:29:35.265 --> 00:29:36.626]  Now, let me keep going here.
[00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:37.967]  This is like Russia.
[00:29:38.248 --> 00:29:45.973]  It's none of the guy's business where you're videotaping something in a studio, but the average American's been programmed to be like a Soviet Nazi.
[00:29:47.074 --> 00:29:47.675]  You cut out.
[00:29:47.915 --> 00:29:49.296]  Well, you say whatever you want here.
[00:29:49.576 --> 00:29:51.057]  You tell us what's not in the DVD.
[00:29:51.317 --> 00:29:52.058]  Lindsey, tell us.
[00:29:52.984 --> 00:29:58.245]  Well, he said, this gentleman, one of them, he knows everything that goes on behind closed doors.
[00:29:58.265 --> 00:30:00.766]  You're talking about D8, D10, I don't care what it is.
[00:30:00.786 --> 00:30:02.546]  This man knows what it is.
[00:30:02.786 --> 00:30:04.467]  He knows he doesn't have much more of his life.
[00:30:04.527 --> 00:30:10.048]  He said, quote, within two years, you will not recognize America.
[00:30:10.888 --> 00:30:14.049]  And the first thing I wanted to know is, what are you talking about?
[00:30:14.749 --> 00:30:15.389]  He said then.
[00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:19.347]  He said, we have altered our timeline.
[00:30:19.367 --> 00:30:20.387]  I'm going to put it this way.
[00:30:20.708 --> 00:30:23.590]  The elite have altered their timeline.
[00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:30.095]  Now, you'll remember back two years ago, I said the price of crude oil is going from $147 to $50 a barrel.
[00:30:30.575 --> 00:30:32.417]  He also said some other thing.
[00:30:32.617 --> 00:30:34.498]  Oh, Alex, I'll get into this as we go along.
[00:30:34.839 --> 00:30:37.020]  He said McCain is a hollow man.
[00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:40.763]  I did not have the slightest idea how important this was.
[00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:44.006]  And I'm going to tell you in a few moments, this Obama guy is in trouble.
[00:30:44.557 --> 00:30:47.158]  The elite have altered their timeline.
[00:30:47.819 --> 00:31:04.268]  After two years, he said again, after two years, you, oh Alex, please, I hope every one of your people out there write this down, and when you think about buying Alex Jones' new DVD, don't you hesitate one second, because here it is, right here.
[00:31:04.688 --> 00:31:12.012]  This gentleman said, after two years, you will be so poor, you will not be able to rebel.
[00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.571]  Alex, I was stunned.
[00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:17.732]  I mean, this man went on and on and on with what they're doing.
[00:31:18.032 --> 00:31:20.472]  Why would you be so poor after two years?
[00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:24.814]  He kept using the expression two years.
[00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:27.935]  They have a new timeline.
[00:31:27.955 --> 00:31:37.678]  You know, people can stand outside and watch these people as they go in, and you've done a marvelous job of telling what you see whenever they go into these meetings.
[00:31:38.661 --> 00:31:52.124]  No way in this world could a person ever talk to one of them himself unless he was under this particular situation with this man this age and his physical condition as it is and he literally poured it all out.
[00:31:52.204 --> 00:31:59.085]  He said after two years you'll be so poor you won't be able to buy my DVD or Alex Jones DVD.
[00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:01.746]  You won't be able to get this material out.
[00:32:02.066 --> 00:32:08.327]  They had it planned and whenever I go into some of the things that is how they're going to bring this about
[00:32:09.002 --> 00:32:12.665]  Okay, I'll give you another one, and I'm going to go back and elaborate on these more.
[00:32:13.206 --> 00:32:17.609]  Inflation will escalate over a period of two years.
[00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:37.106]  You'll remember back two years ago, this gentleman said to me, we're going to have inflation, and I kept predicting it was going to take place in a year to a year and a half, and I'm saying now they have altered their timeline to the point that inflation will take place and escalate over a period of two years, and by the end of that two years,
[00:32:37.734 --> 00:32:49.356]  The dollar will have so collapsed and inflation will be so high that there's no way in this world you'll even be able to afford that airline ticket to go to some Boston Tea Party somewhere.
[00:32:49.796 --> 00:32:52.977]  They have it planned within two... They feel like they have it made.
[00:32:52.997 --> 00:32:56.738]  I mean, they literally think that they have everything in the bag.
[00:32:56.978 --> 00:32:58.458]  They've got it right where they want it.
[00:32:58.858 --> 00:33:01.259]  You bust... Oh my goodness.
[00:33:02.273 --> 00:33:04.235]  You poor, stupid, dumb Americans.
[00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:06.617]  I mean, they think they're laughing at you.
[00:33:07.277 --> 00:33:10.240]  I mean, this gentleman... Well, Lindsey, let me stop you.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.641]  Let me stop you.
[00:33:11.741 --> 00:33:16.084]  Earlier I read Club of Rome documents where they said we're going to destroy the economy by design.
[00:33:16.525 --> 00:33:21.949]  Maurice Strong at the UN in 92 said, through carbon tax, we will destroy the industrial economy.
[00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:27.093]  They admit this, and now Schwarzenegger's announcing he's going to ban 40-inch TVs.
[00:33:27.614 --> 00:33:28.354]  They're announcing...
[00:33:29.415 --> 00:33:31.017]  Animal ID, premises ID.
[00:33:31.418 --> 00:33:35.343]  They're announcing they're going to shut down small markets and bazaars and garage sales.
[00:33:35.824 --> 00:33:38.187]  They're announcing troops to be deployed on the streets.
[00:33:38.968 --> 00:33:44.134]  They're openly admitting they want to destroy our industry, but you're talking to this high-level elitist.
[00:33:44.795 --> 00:33:51.902]  Who's given you other good intel in the past, and he was going further specifically that they are doing this to destroy the economy.
[00:33:52.222 --> 00:33:54.364]  They've stolen tens of trillions of our own money.
[00:33:54.744 --> 00:33:55.805]  They're hoarding the money.
[00:33:55.885 --> 00:33:56.786]  They're not loaning it.
[00:33:56.846 --> 00:33:58.128]  That's even mainstream news.
[00:33:58.688 --> 00:34:00.270]  Government's taking over society.
[00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.772]  Go through the bullet points and then go back over them.
[00:34:03.052 --> 00:34:06.996]  So he's saying in the next two years, they're bringing us into a full bore depression.
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.251]  They already have a timeline set.
[00:34:09.511 --> 00:34:11.272]  They have a date set, Alex.
[00:34:11.352 --> 00:34:12.812]  I mean, I was so appalled.
[00:34:13.032 --> 00:34:14.073]  He never did this before.
[00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.352]  Yeah, he went on to say all of this.
[00:34:26.753 --> 00:34:28.454]  Okay, here's the next one.
[00:34:28.895 --> 00:34:33.279]  Inflation will escalate over a period of two years and they're going to do this by design plan.
[00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:37.903]  I actually have a schedule of events in chronological order, Alex.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.401]  It doesn't take a whole show within itself.
[00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:56.965]  The schedule of events in chronological order over the next two years of what they're going to do, and if you know what the schedule of events is, you will be able to follow it and design your own family's dinner table and your job.
[00:34:57.005 --> 00:34:59.266]  Okay, let me go back to the main line here.
[00:34:59.786 --> 00:35:02.447]  Inflation will escalate over a period of two years.
[00:35:03.007 --> 00:35:06.069]  Crude oil prices will remain somewhere around this.
[00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:08.351]  They may spike up, they may spike down a little bit.
[00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:10.893]  And then, Alex, I asked him about gold and silver.
[00:35:11.514 --> 00:35:14.536]  And this is something I did not ask him about two years ago.
[00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:19.279]  And you asked me on your show, I think it was, last time I was on, about gold and silver.
[00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:21.861]  Numbers of other talk show hosts have asked me the same thing.
[00:35:22.262 --> 00:35:25.184]  I couldn't answer it, so I asked him the question.
[00:35:25.484 --> 00:35:27.485]  I said, what about gold and silver?
[00:35:27.546 --> 00:35:28.006]  Are you ready?
[00:35:28.692 --> 00:35:34.198]  I mean, this is going to be startling also, and it'll definitely help you know exactly what to do.
[00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.600]  Okay, I don't know what you're going to say.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.360]  Tell me, Lindsey.
[00:35:37.021 --> 00:35:41.065]  He said gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[00:35:42.247 --> 00:35:43.448]  He said this is our money.
[00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:45.170]  This is what they use.
[00:35:45.717 --> 00:36:02.544]  Have you ever thought about the fact that when you go in there to buy it, you don't pay any state sales tax, there's no regulations, there's no records kept, you can buy and sell amongst yourselves, gold and silver is their currency, they don't depend on paper, they laugh at these Federal Reserve notes and this paper that's going up and down like a yo-yo.
[00:36:02.964 --> 00:36:05.665]  He said gold and silver are all you can depend on.
[00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:07.846]  I'll put it in his exact words.
[00:36:08.206 --> 00:36:10.887]  He said gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:14.068]  Now, folks, you take the statement and go with it any way you want to.
[00:36:14.108 --> 00:36:16.129]  You go deal with it what you want to.
[00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:18.149]  But I'm just telling you what he said.
[00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.310]  You cannot depend on the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.630]  Note, it's on its way out.
[00:36:22.511 --> 00:36:23.931]  By 2012, the dollar will be dead.
[00:36:26.658 --> 00:36:30.979]  Folks, please, I beg of you, listen to what Alex Jones is saying.
[00:36:31.419 --> 00:36:35.200]  He's telling you things that I know you feel are difficult to believe.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.961]  I'm telling you exactly what one of the elitists themselves said.
[00:36:38.981 --> 00:36:44.723]  Well, they're openly saying in the newspaper, they're openly saying in the newspaper they're going to kill the dollar now.
[00:36:44.743 --> 00:36:47.283]  Please continue, Lindsey.
[00:36:47.303 --> 00:36:51.244]  On this one, Alex, and this one would take a whole program within itself, too.
[00:36:51.824 --> 00:36:53.685]  War, you ready?
[00:36:54.246 --> 00:36:55.407]  Folks, this is stunning.
[00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:56.848]  This is startling.
[00:36:57.329 --> 00:36:59.631]  War is planned after two years.
[00:37:01.973 --> 00:37:02.534]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:05.076]  This shook me to no end.
[00:37:05.396 --> 00:37:07.058]  And I asked him to elaborate.
[00:37:07.418 --> 00:37:09.300]  And he even said where it's going to take place.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.722]  And he said where it'll start and how it'll spread.
[00:37:12.002 --> 00:37:13.043]  It's already planned.
[00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.453]  Well, Lindsey, we're going to tell people about the DVD where you lay this out over three hours.
[00:37:18.473 --> 00:37:23.616]  We're going to have you back on tomorrow for part two of this, if you can do it, if not Wednesday.
[00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:31.942]  But tell us what region, because I mean, last time you laid your money where your mouth is with the oil prediction from him.
[00:37:31.982 --> 00:37:32.562]  You were right.
[00:37:32.962 --> 00:37:33.823]  Where is he saying?
[00:37:34.103 --> 00:37:36.605]  The intel I've got from the Rand Corporation
[00:37:37.365 --> 00:37:46.649]  And the Pentagon is, they're going to start wars in Eastern Europe, wars in Central Asia, and wars in the Middle East simultaneously on the order of World War II.
[00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.111]  Is that a... It won't start in Iran.
[00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:53.312]  It'll start around that Middle East area.
[00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:59.775]  And it will more than likely be in relationship to Iran and Israel, and it will spread to the entire world.
[00:38:01.035 --> 00:38:02.836]  I'll elaborate more and more on that later.
[00:38:02.856 --> 00:38:04.557]  But he says they're waiting for two years.
[00:38:05.734 --> 00:38:07.941]  He said you've got a two-year timeline.
[00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:11.814]  Okay, folks, please, please listen to me.
[00:38:13.297 --> 00:38:22.503]  You positively must take action immediately or your children and your grandchildren will forever be slaves to the elite.
[00:38:23.303 --> 00:38:28.206]  Hunzey, I've never heard you with this much earnest in your voice and that's how I am.
[00:38:28.607 --> 00:38:29.587]  It's coming down.
[00:38:29.727 --> 00:38:31.509]  I've never seen them move this quick.
[00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:35.511]  I can't even believe the lightning speed they're implementing everything.
[00:38:36.372 --> 00:38:37.813]  The elite are laughing at us.
[00:38:38.313 --> 00:38:40.574]  Alex, I am so stunned.
[00:38:40.774 --> 00:38:41.235]  You know why?
[00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:42.840]  Okay.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.741]  I've got so much, I don't even know where to go.
[00:38:46.082 --> 00:38:48.284]  You know why the elite altered their timeline?
[00:38:49.004 --> 00:38:49.584]  You know why.
[00:38:49.865 --> 00:38:51.846]  But I want to give it to you as they said it.
[00:38:52.367 --> 00:38:58.751]  The elite have altered their timeline because you gave them two and one half trillion dollars in the last two months of the Bush administration.
[00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:01.213]  Folks, you've got to hear this in depth.
[00:39:02.354 --> 00:39:04.756]  I mean, this would take the longest to go into why.
[00:39:04.836 --> 00:39:05.796]  I'll tell you briefly.
[00:39:06.357 --> 00:39:07.738]  Just before Bush left office,
[00:39:08.311 --> 00:39:10.674]  They had created an artificial crisis.
[00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:12.015]  It really didn't exist.
[00:39:12.095 --> 00:39:14.959]  Isn't it amazing that that crisis isn't out there anymore right now?
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:22.988]  They came out and bad-mouthed the market and said we'd have a depression and it went down a couple thousand points.
[00:39:23.048 --> 00:39:26.512]  They admit, the Congress admits, they were terrorized into it.
[00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:31.564]  Yeah, they were terrorized into it, and the stock market is going to keep going up and up and up and up.
[00:39:32.364 --> 00:39:35.407]  Mark my words, he told me what's going to happen to the stock market.
[00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:37.748]  He told me where the price of gold is going.
[00:39:38.128 --> 00:39:44.653]  He gave a schedule of events, chronologically in order, over the next two years.
[00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:48.756]  I think he was really doing it, Alex, because he is so concerned.
[00:39:48.776 --> 00:39:54.840]  I mean, his conscience must be telling him what this man feels like, knowing his age and where he is.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:10.064]  And I think, really, he was trying his best to do everything he could to warn people, folks, you have got to take action immediately or your children and grandchildren will ever, forever... Okay, let me go back to why they altered that timeline.
[00:40:10.484 --> 00:40:14.845]  In the last two months of the Bush administration, they created an artificial crisis.
[00:40:15.105 --> 00:40:16.746]  You know, that's what the elite is so good at.
[00:40:16.786 --> 00:40:19.346]  They create a crisis, then they create a solution.
[00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:22.027]  Well, the solution was for the American taxpayer
[00:40:22.367 --> 00:40:51.774]  To give, through the Federal Reserve, all of these trillions of dollars, and then, I'm sure you remember what happened after it was all over with, and some of the news services came out and said, we have got to know where that money went to, and they, I've got the clip on my DVD, they said, when the representative of the Federal Reserve was asked to appear before Congress, and they demanded to know where two and one half trillion
[00:40:52.515 --> 00:40:54.576]  Of this money went, they said we can't tell you.
[00:40:55.796 --> 00:40:56.737]  We won't let you know.
[00:40:57.517 --> 00:40:58.657]  We refuse to answer.
[00:40:59.378 --> 00:41:11.822]  And as a result of you, the taxpayer, stupid, dumb, gullible, they've given you baseball and apple pie, and your beer, and you've become satisfied with a job, and you know what?
[00:41:12.022 --> 00:41:14.003]  J-O-B, you know what job means?
[00:41:14.283 --> 00:41:15.303]  Just Overbroke.
[00:41:15.683 --> 00:41:20.145]  They've given you exactly just enough to keep you quiet so that you won't rise up
[00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:26.795]  And when you gave them two and one half trillion dollars approximately, they altered their timeline!
[00:41:26.815 --> 00:41:30.298]  I mean, when this man told me what they have done...
[00:41:30.828 --> 00:41:34.730]  And basically it's for your good because you've got just a little bit longer.
[00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.311]  They think they've almost got it made.
[00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:39.172]  They're sure that you're not going to rise up and do anything about it.
[00:41:39.613 --> 00:41:43.474]  You are not going to revolt because they know that you're already so poor.
[00:41:43.815 --> 00:41:48.597]  And after two years, he said, you'll be so poor you will not be able to rebel against the elite.
[00:41:48.977 --> 00:41:52.319]  And the elite are laughing at the gullible, stupid American.
[00:41:52.339 --> 00:41:54.180]  Now, folks, please forgive me for saying that.
[00:41:54.608 --> 00:42:00.552]  But the elite are laughing at us because they know that they have us exactly where they want us.
[00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:02.354]  Okay, here goes.
[00:42:02.514 --> 00:42:03.615]  I'll give you the next statement.
[00:42:03.995 --> 00:42:08.698]  Within two years, nearly everyone will be working for the government.
[00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:10.019]  Oh, watch it.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.340]  General Motors.
[00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:12.301]  What happened?
[00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:13.439]  They bailed him out.
[00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:18.441]  So now the President of the United States of America is CEO of General Motors and Chrysler.
[00:42:18.961 --> 00:42:20.122]  Then the banks came along.
[00:42:20.562 --> 00:42:26.384]  And they're gobbling up another 7, 8, 10 banks gradually, a little bit at a time, every single weekend.
[00:42:26.404 --> 00:42:27.924]  Now they're taking over health care.
[00:42:27.944 --> 00:42:29.905]  They're going to issue national ID cards.
[00:42:30.165 --> 00:42:31.725]  They're going to have to have one to have a job.
[00:42:31.745 --> 00:42:32.426]  They've announced it.
[00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:33.506]  Stay there, Lindsey Williams.
[00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:41.809]  And the carbon tax won't let you drive, live, home inspections, teenagers in uniforms, running around with weapons.
[00:42:43.055 --> 00:42:45.437]  Just hell is gonna be released on us.
[00:42:46.639 --> 00:42:49.141]  Lindsey Williams with Inside Info straight ahead.
[00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:49.962]  Key information.

[00:43:53.254 --> 00:43:58.388]  When the New World Orders war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:59.196 --> 00:44:04.541]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:11.266]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:11.586 --> 00:44:13.388]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:13.548 --> 00:44:15.930]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:26.899]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:44:29.176 --> 00:44:30.437]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:30.837 --> 00:44:32.257]  It's about a one world government.
[00:44:32.697 --> 00:44:39.060]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:03.939]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:09.403]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[00:46:09.844 --> 00:46:14.467]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[00:46:15.348 --> 00:46:27.857]  You know, we're talking to Lindsey Williams, Pastor Lindsey Williams, inside Whistleblower, when he worked with Atlantic Richfield and a bunch of other big oil companies up on the Alaskan shelf there on the slope.
[00:46:28.922 --> 00:46:30.043]  He blew the whistle about that.
[00:46:30.584 --> 00:46:34.908]  Turned out he was absolutely accurate decades later when it was released by Congress.
[00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:37.911]  Same thing in the Gulf of Mexico, full of oil.
[00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:40.874]  They won't let us get to it in many areas, but the Chinese and others are allowed to have it.
[00:46:41.275 --> 00:46:44.758]  Then he talked to this insider, this former CEO of an oil company, one of the biggest.
[00:46:45.579 --> 00:46:46.861]  The fellow thought he was going to die.
[00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:52.048]  And I guess that near-death experience has made him totally spill his guts to Lindsey.
[00:46:52.688 --> 00:46:57.051]  But now, so much of what Lindsey's saying from this insider is clear, even from mainstream news.
[00:46:57.531 --> 00:47:02.414]  Lindsey was speaking about Fall of the Republic, because, you know, he's retired, been out of the country some with family.
[00:47:02.874 --> 00:47:12.880]  He came back, he just now heard I have Fall of the Republic, and he's saying, and we haven't talked since my producer just called and got him on, because Lindsey was ready to come on and emailed us.
[00:47:15.688 --> 00:47:30.233]  Everyone listening to the Alex Jones Show right now, I must clarify this.
[00:47:30.713 --> 00:47:37.076]  Alex and I have not talked one single time off of the program privately.
[00:47:37.556 --> 00:47:38.916]  We have not compared notes.
[00:47:39.396 --> 00:47:41.157]  He did not know what I was going to say today.
[00:47:41.177 --> 00:47:43.898]  He did not know what the elite told me.
[00:47:45.316 --> 00:47:47.838]  I likewise did not know about his new DVD.
[00:47:48.138 --> 00:47:51.159]  Folks, we have not compared notes and planned this program.
[00:47:51.199 --> 00:47:52.240]  I know it sounds like it.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.402]  And some of you sitting out there are going to say, well, I'm quite sure these two guys got together and planned to say all this.
[00:47:57.482 --> 00:47:59.143]  No, we did not, did we, Alex?
[00:48:00.383 --> 00:48:00.643]  No!
[00:48:00.764 --> 00:48:07.547]  I mean, you've been told by your high-level retired CEO, highest levels, this information.
[00:48:07.947 --> 00:48:09.708]  I've made a film, Reverse Engineering.
[00:48:09.728 --> 00:48:11.949]  I mean, I've got Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:48:13.012 --> 00:48:20.899]  UN climate change treaty that says world government and I mean I've got it right here and that they say in their literature they want to destroy our economy.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:35.172]  I had a economist from Argentina on a few months ago and he talked about how the IMF and World Bank come in, and we have their documents as well, and bankrupt these countries by design so that you're so poor and starving you can't resist.
[00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.834]  They're not deploying NORTHCOM for no reason.
[00:48:37.874 --> 00:48:38.255]  They're not
[00:48:39.189 --> 00:48:39.769]  Two years!
[00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:40.170]  Two years!
[00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.991]  He kept using it over and over and over again.
[00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:42.291]  Two years!
[00:48:42.331 --> 00:48:45.354]  Within two years, you will not recognize America.
[00:48:45.374 --> 00:48:46.154]  They have a timeline.
[00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:48.036]  The elitists have altered their timeline because you
[00:49:06.852 --> 00:49:17.160]  And me, the gullible Americans, gave them $2.5 trillion approximately, and Bloomberg demanded of Congress to get an answer.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:32.271]  They came before the Congress of the United States of America, the person representing the Federal Reserve, and said, I refuse to tell you where $2.5 trillion went to tell you where the other money went, but $2.5 trillion you gave to the elite!
[00:49:32.631 --> 00:49:34.573]  And they still have not told you where it's going.
[00:49:34.853 --> 00:49:37.234]  So as a result, they altered their timeline.
[00:49:37.294 --> 00:49:39.015]  You've got to hear all the details of that.
[00:49:39.035 --> 00:49:40.636]  They're accelerating it, correct?
[00:49:40.716 --> 00:49:43.457]  They're accelerating the timeline.
[00:49:43.497 --> 00:49:44.637]  Well, I don't know.
[00:49:44.917 --> 00:49:51.060]  Because you see, two years ago, he told me, he said, you're going to have massive inflation within a year to a year and a half.
[00:49:51.681 --> 00:50:06.600]  Well, they didn't do that, because when they were able to alter their timeline, and they've done some amazing things in these D8 meetings and so on, where you have attended and watched from the outside, and here this man is telling me what they did on the inside,
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.141]  No, I know, but I mean, it was going to be a gradual inflation, and now they're admitting it.
[00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:23.123]  To me, even though it looks like it's not an acceleration, it is an acceleration, because it appears they're moving in with their entire program in the next two years instead of just one plank of it more quickly.
[00:50:23.883 --> 00:50:25.263]  But, Lindsey, one minute break.
[00:50:25.283 --> 00:50:27.684]  We're coming back with the final hour straight ahead.
[00:50:27.804 --> 00:50:28.304]  Stay there.
[00:50:28.644 --> 00:50:29.784]  We'll get into the next points.
[00:50:29.864 --> 00:50:30.324]  Stay with us.
[00:50:33.765 --> 00:50:35.485]  Thank you for listening to GCS.
[00:50:37.187 --> 00:50:39.218]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:50:42.691 --> 00:50:45.292]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:50:45.693 --> 00:50:50.655]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:50:51.016 --> 00:50:52.757]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:50:53.077 --> 00:50:57.879]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:50:58.079 --> 00:50:59.040]  How much do you want?
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.000]  When do you want it?
[00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:01.982]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:51:02.262 --> 00:51:03.082]  When will you need it?
[00:51:03.342 --> 00:51:05.403]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:51:05.544 --> 00:51:06.644]  Will there be any food?
[00:51:06.884 --> 00:51:08.185]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:51:08.405 --> 00:51:13.470]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:16.853]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:51:17.253 --> 00:51:20.756]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:22.057]  How much will you need?
[00:51:22.298 --> 00:51:22.918]  We don't know.
[00:51:23.198 --> 00:51:24.119]  How much do you want?
[00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:25.040]  All you can get.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:25.921]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:26.321 --> 00:51:29.082]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:51:29.362 --> 00:51:31.542]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:31.562 --> 00:51:32.582]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:32.602 --> 00:51:33.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:33.783 --> 00:51:35.603]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:51:57.173 --> 00:52:25.464]  Lindsay Williams for part two of this interview is going to be back with us on Wednesday.
[00:52:27.352 --> 00:52:30.396]  He's going to be back with us again on Friday, because I believe him.
[00:52:30.837 --> 00:52:32.419]  His information turned out to be very accurate.
[00:52:32.739 --> 00:52:35.483]  He said for at least a year, oil would go to 50.
[00:52:35.623 --> 00:52:37.265]  It did that.
[00:52:38.086 --> 00:52:40.068]  Now it's going back up, but not much.
[00:52:41.292 --> 00:52:43.833]  And this individual said that they changed their timeline.
[00:52:44.333 --> 00:52:57.217]  Okay, Lindsey, before we go any further, I want to run through more of... Let's just run through the skeleton of your notes, and then when we have time, we'll go back through more of the notes, and then on Wednesday, we'll dissect more in-depth in areas we didn't get to today.
[00:52:58.297 --> 00:53:02.979]  But, uh... We're already here in the last hour today.
[00:53:04.505 --> 00:53:11.251]  Tell us about the DVD, because I know you flesh out the points in the DVD, but people don't want to go crazy waiting for it.
[00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:16.275]  They should order it right now, but also then give us the skeleton of it, point by point, then go back over it.
[00:53:16.315 --> 00:53:18.517]  But tell folks how they get this three-part DVD.
[00:53:19.317 --> 00:53:19.938]  Okay.
[00:53:19.998 --> 00:53:21.199]  New toll-free number.
[00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:23.381]  Please do not call my old toll-free number.
[00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:25.551]  Here, you have a pencil and paper.
[00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:28.472]  Write down my new toll-free number.
[00:53:28.512 --> 00:53:30.593]  We've got seven operators standing by.
[00:53:30.793 --> 00:53:31.693]  Immediate shipping.
[00:53:31.713 --> 00:53:33.714]  We're not going to make you wait a week to a week and a half.
[00:53:34.154 --> 00:53:36.174]  I told them, I said, we've got to do this immediately.
[00:53:36.214 --> 00:53:36.855]  Here's the number.
[00:53:37.375 --> 00:53:38.215]  Toll-free number.
[00:53:38.235 --> 00:53:38.515]  888-799-6111.
[00:53:38.535 --> 00:53:38.775]  Again, 888-799-6111.
[00:53:49.683 --> 00:53:50.084]  6-1-1-1.
[00:53:50.944 --> 00:53:52.286]  We give immediate shipping now.
[00:53:52.426 --> 00:53:54.788]  We don't make you wait a week and a half like we did before.
[00:53:55.348 --> 00:53:57.150]  Six new DVDs.
[00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.691]  Six.
[00:53:58.011 --> 00:54:03.656]  Three of them are the ones I did in studio this past week where I tell everything this man told me.
[00:54:03.976 --> 00:54:05.818]  Now please, I beg of you to get them.
[00:54:06.638 --> 00:54:08.259]  We've done something new also.
[00:54:08.299 --> 00:54:13.062]  We're putting it all in one beautiful folder with a multi-color cover.
[00:54:13.462 --> 00:54:15.303]  You've never seen anything so attractive.
[00:54:15.423 --> 00:54:16.824]  You've got it all in one now.
[00:54:17.204 --> 00:54:19.025]  And truly, professionally done.
[00:54:19.086 --> 00:54:21.427]  I told these people, I said, we've got to get this message out.
[00:54:21.467 --> 00:54:22.167]  Okay, here we go.
[00:54:22.467 --> 00:54:24.128]  Let's go to the content of all of this.
[00:54:24.629 --> 00:54:25.269]  Two years.
[00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:26.050]  Two years.
[00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.570]  Two years.
[00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:28.711]  Folks, put it down in your calendar.
[00:54:28.871 --> 00:54:29.712]  I beg of you.
[00:54:30.332 --> 00:54:32.893]  He said, he kept using the expression two years.
[00:54:33.154 --> 00:54:33.754]  Hold on, Lindsey.
[00:54:33.774 --> 00:54:35.275]  You've got to give the toll-free number out.
[00:54:36.786 --> 00:54:37.226]  Say again?
[00:54:37.486 --> 00:54:42.347]  Give the number out again.
[00:54:42.367 --> 00:54:45.448]  Okay, the number is 888-799-6111.
[00:54:45.668 --> 00:54:48.848]  No one has ever gotten this material before.
[00:54:48.868 --> 00:54:51.289]  This Alex Jones Show is the first one I've ever been on.
[00:54:51.529 --> 00:54:51.969]  The first.
[00:54:51.989 --> 00:54:52.829]  888-799-6111.
[00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:57.790]  Seven operators standing by.
[00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:58.490]  Please.
[00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:03.011]  My new three DVDs we did in studio in Kansas City this past week.
[00:55:03.251 --> 00:55:04.592]  Now, here's the content.
[00:55:05.092 --> 00:55:05.992]  Within two years,
[00:55:06.542 --> 00:55:08.303]  And he gives everything.
[00:55:08.443 --> 00:55:12.746]  Alex, I'm going to give you one expression, and we'll elaborate on this too later in this week.
[00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:15.807]  He kept using the expression, the devil's messiah.
[00:55:16.167 --> 00:55:23.752]  Now I know, oh my goodness Alex, they have manipulated the churches, as well as the pastors of America.
[00:55:23.772 --> 00:55:25.913]  Hold on Lindsey, you just dropped a bomb on me.
[00:55:27.174 --> 00:55:30.816]  Everything else you said we can see unfolding, and I believe he told you this.
[00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:35.112]  This guy then talked about the devil's messiah with you?
[00:55:35.132 --> 00:55:38.354]  This man, I was stunned.
[00:55:38.534 --> 00:55:38.795]  What?
[00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:40.556]  No wonder you're shaking.
[00:55:40.816 --> 00:55:44.639]  I've never, listen folks, I'm talking to Lindsey during the break, his voice is shaking.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.421]  You've never acted like this.
[00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:47.562]  What else did you learn?
[00:55:47.882 --> 00:55:49.223]  What the hell's going on here?
[00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:49.884]  Excuse me.
[00:55:51.165 --> 00:55:53.707]  Well, yeah, and that's exactly right too.
[00:55:53.747 --> 00:55:57.650]  Just what you word, the word you use, it's exactly what's going to be going on.
[00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.731]  Two years,
[00:55:59.505 --> 00:56:01.587]  Two years you will not recognize America.
[00:56:01.987 --> 00:56:04.630]  They're working through the pastors, they're working through the churches.
[00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.733]  And I get into this, I'm going to have to shame some pastors now.
[00:56:07.773 --> 00:56:10.695]  I have been a minister for 50 years.
[00:56:11.136 --> 00:56:12.637]  I'm 73 years of age.
[00:56:13.118 --> 00:56:16.461]  And Alex, this man went into the subject, the Devil's Messiah.
[00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:38.201]  The pastors of America and the churches and how they're working through Homeland Security in relation to the deception of the pastors and the churches for pulling the people in and he went on to talk about within two years they'll be able to fulfill everything they want to do and that the elite have altered their timeline to the point they feel that they have completely got it made.
[00:56:38.401 --> 00:56:39.563]  Stay there, Lindsey.
[00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:40.784]  Lindsey, long segment.
[00:56:41.832 --> 00:56:49.058]  I want you to just get those notes, read us the bullet points, and then we'll go back to the beginning, back to the Antichrist part.
[00:56:50.179 --> 00:56:51.020]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:51.841]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:51.961 --> 00:56:57.125]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:56:57.266 --> 00:57:01.629]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.651]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:04.072 --> 00:57:05.413]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:05.673 --> 00:57:06.714]  There is a solution.
[00:57:06.934 --> 00:57:14.962]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:57:51.974 --> 00:58:01.801]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:03.482]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:58:03.682 --> 00:58:04.403]  It's very real.
[00:58:04.763 --> 00:58:05.123]  I know.
[00:58:05.464 --> 00:58:08.966]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:58:09.347 --> 00:58:12.088]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:58:27.899 --> 00:58:36.104]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[00:58:41.307 --> 00:58:41.527]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:53.631]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.671 --> 00:58:59.032]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:59.272 --> 00:59:03.893]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:04.293 --> 00:59:09.354]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:09.855 --> 00:59:14.555]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:15.076 --> 00:59:16.956]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:59:17.392 --> 00:59:17.872]  I don't know.
[00:59:30.006 --> 00:59:32.848]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:33.188 --> 00:59:35.070]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:36.330]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:36.731]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:36.751 --> 00:59:39.493]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.714]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:52.361 --> 00:59:57.404]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:57.764 --> 01:00:00.006]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:26.854]  By the way, we have David Ray Griffin on tomorrow, debunking the 9-11 debunkers, going over all the huge new developments on 9-11.
[01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:32.281]  But, from 11.30 to 1, in the first two hours tomorrow, we're going to have part two of this.
[01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:34.784]  It's clear this information is too powerful.
[01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:38.428]  I believe that this high-level globalist, and I have...
[01:00:39.645 --> 01:00:40.305]  Know who it is.
[01:00:40.325 --> 01:00:44.187]  You know, Lindsey didn't break his promise.
[01:00:44.447 --> 01:00:55.893]  I've been interviewing him so long, I know who the three CEOs were that he mentioned by name earlier from the oil companies he worked at and for, and so then I've narrowed it down.
[01:00:55.933 --> 01:01:01.996]  But the point is, is that this is fitting in with all the other Bilderberg info we have.
[01:01:02.776 --> 01:01:05.918]  I believe Lindsey, when he called and said he had inside knowledge two years ago,
[01:01:07.528 --> 01:01:15.554]  Almost two years ago, more than a year and a half ago, that oil would go down to $50 a barrel and stay there for a year.
[01:01:16.134 --> 01:01:16.655]  And it did that.
[01:01:17.055 --> 01:01:17.935]  Incredible prediction.
[01:01:18.015 --> 01:01:19.096]  No one saw that coming.
[01:01:19.496 --> 01:01:29.523]  But then I noticed in our own Bilderberg coverage, it was a footnote from Jim Tucker and a footnote from Daniel Estill and that inside sources said Bilderberg was going to cut oil in half from 150 to below 70.
[01:01:29.563 --> 01:01:29.964]  That happened.
[01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.231]  So, again, people ask, how do I know what's credible?
[01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:39.312]  How do I know what's not?
[01:01:39.392 --> 01:01:41.533]  Well, number one, has somebody been accurate over and over again?
[01:01:41.793 --> 01:01:42.093]  Yes.
[01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:45.575]  Number two, does it fit in with all the other intel I have?
[01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:45.895]  Yes.
[01:01:46.416 --> 01:01:51.558]  Now, could they alter something maybe down the road if we get involved, if we speak up, if we say no?
[01:01:52.218 --> 01:01:55.360]  But America has capitulated.
[01:01:56.781 --> 01:02:01.163]  The United States has given in to tyranny.
[01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:08.309]  And once they know you've capitulated and will put up with anything, then that's when the real tyranny starts.
[01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.411]  All the tyranny and corruption we've seen is only the beginning.
[01:02:10.771 --> 01:02:27.344]  I was just shown a video of police in Milwaukee, a guy on a bike, the police say stop, try to taser him, the guy gets scared, the police run him over in the car, killing him, admitting they wanted to kill him, and then the police are heroes on the news.
[01:02:28.585 --> 01:02:29.646]  That's pure evil.
[01:02:30.609 --> 01:02:38.416]  Just like they rubber bullet people to death and they killed a guy in Seattle last year.
[01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:41.880]  The guy just comes outside from a store.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.401]  They think he's another suspect.
[01:02:44.062 --> 01:02:46.404]  They come over, he gets scared by the cop, kind of turns.
[01:02:46.664 --> 01:02:48.906]  The cop knocks him up, hits the ground, kills him.
[01:02:49.267 --> 01:02:52.009]  The cops are on the TV saying, we don't care, we didn't do anything wrong.
[01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.673]  They've dehumanized us and the police themselves are dehumanized.
[01:02:57.309 --> 01:03:01.255]  But I mean, they just murder this guy and don't care.
[01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:04.340]  Stormtrippers of death, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:09.749]  And I know the average cop is an evil person in and of themselves, but the mantle, the system, the training...
[01:03:12.734 --> 01:03:14.896]  Anyway, side issue, it's just God help us all.
[01:03:15.196 --> 01:03:16.297]  We are an evil nation.
[01:03:16.677 --> 01:03:17.978]  We are now being brought to judgment.
[01:03:18.279 --> 01:03:26.085]  Now, Lindsey Williams, you've always been credible, and I believe that this high-level retired executive who almost died recently did spill his guts to you.
[01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:29.488]  Charlotte Isserby was the number two at the Department of Education.
[01:03:30.048 --> 01:03:32.510]  She said they were planning year-round schooling.
[01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:36.594]  A decade ago on this show, everything she said is now coming true.
[01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:44.558]  She wrote a book the size of a Dallas phone book that we sell, by the way, Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, and it's mainly just documents.
[01:03:45.479 --> 01:03:46.760]  So I know this is their plan.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.022]  Just like I read they planned to ban most air travel.
[01:03:49.342 --> 01:03:50.904]  It's now mainstream news today.
[01:03:53.326 --> 01:03:56.790]  I knew they had face scanning and license plate reading stuff 12 years ago.
[01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:57.931]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:03:59.746 --> 01:04:07.188]  So, Charlotte Iserby's father, he was skull and bones, and Bohemian Grove, and always kind of laughed at her and her antinatal order stance.
[01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:09.889]  She was taking care of him while he was dying of cancer.
[01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:15.751]  And he would hear her doing radio interviews, and about a month before he died, he accepted Jesus.
[01:04:15.771 --> 01:04:21.473]  A lot of people don't like to hear this, but this is what got him to come out of his situation.
[01:04:23.354 --> 01:04:27.475]  And he cried and said, yes, basically, it's Satanism.
[01:04:28.587 --> 01:04:29.267]  And repented.
[01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:34.269]  And said, I wish I was well to go back and tell the other guys that they shouldn't be part of this.
[01:04:35.869 --> 01:04:37.249]  And I want to tell the police that.
[01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:38.870]  You've got time to turn back.
[01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:41.010]  But you are the army of Satan now.
[01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:44.751]  I mean, even if you don't believe in God, this is satanic.
[01:04:44.811 --> 01:04:45.371]  This is evil.
[01:04:45.732 --> 01:04:46.492]  What else do you call it?
[01:04:46.692 --> 01:04:49.813]  Now, Lindsey, I'm going to shut up, because I've got a few other things I've got to cover, too.
[01:04:49.873 --> 01:04:51.233]  I've got to intersperse some news.
[01:04:51.713 --> 01:04:53.013]  But you're back tomorrow.
[01:04:53.574 --> 01:04:54.354]  Thank God for that.
[01:04:55.236 --> 01:05:08.356]  But just do this, go over the bullet points quickly, then I got page after page, a prelude for tomorrow, but then go back to this guy saying how they've taken over the churches and the devils
[01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:10.872]  What was the term he used?
[01:05:10.912 --> 01:05:13.434]  The Devil's... Devil's Messiah.
[01:05:13.714 --> 01:05:14.835]  The Devil's Messiah.
[01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:19.299]  And at the elite level, they're all into Luciferianism.
[01:05:19.319 --> 01:05:19.979]  There's no doubt.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.101]  I mean, that's been in their own documents.
[01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:23.162]  This is so insane.
[01:05:23.682 --> 01:05:24.303]  But it's real.
[01:05:25.224 --> 01:05:25.724]  Continue.
[01:05:27.085 --> 01:05:37.394]  Alex, and everybody out there in the listening audience, they're positively... I must emphasize that they're positively is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[01:05:38.426 --> 01:05:40.387]  You've had Alex say this over and over and over.
[01:05:40.447 --> 01:05:42.548]  I'm punctuating it again right now.
[01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:46.909]  There is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:48.010]  They are for real.
[01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.330]  They know what they're doing.
[01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:51.931]  They are able to accomplish what they want.
[01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:53.192]  They control Congress.
[01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:54.432]  They control the President.
[01:05:54.812 --> 01:05:56.913]  And by the way, they're having trouble with this President.
[01:05:56.993 --> 01:05:59.374]  Whenever I get... I think I'll probably save that for tomorrow.
[01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:00.690]  I don't know.
[01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:24.401]  They're having trouble, and this gentleman went on to tell me the trouble they're having with Mr. Obama, and they had some choice words.
[01:06:24.441 --> 01:06:33.865]  Oh my gracious, I'd shake in my shoes if I was Mr. Obama right now, because the elite don't like his arrogance, pride, and some of the other things he's doing.
[01:06:33.925 --> 01:06:35.105]  Okay, let's get back to this.
[01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:36.566]  They do exist!
[01:06:37.304 --> 01:06:38.905]  This man told me what they're doing.
[01:06:38.925 --> 01:06:44.947]  You're right about the other gentleman who on his deathbed said, don't follow these people.
[01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.768]  They're positively Satanist.
[01:06:47.188 --> 01:06:52.890]  One of the first things I learned when I lived with the elite years ago was to listen to their buzzwords.
[01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:58.392]  I'd like to read you a few buzzwords that this man used.
[01:06:59.039 --> 01:07:07.021]  And I want you to quickly, in your mind, think, what is the very first thing you think about whenever I give you these buzzwords?
[01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:20.503]  Now, these are his exact statements, and whenever I read you his buzzwords, I know how to understand them, because I learned years ago to read between the lines, listen to that buzzword, and then know what they're talking about.
[01:07:20.663 --> 01:07:28.205]  Okay, I'm going to read you his buzzwords, word for word, and then the first thing that pops in your mind that you think these buzzwords mean, here goes.
[01:07:29.858 --> 01:07:32.540]  War brought the country out of the depression.
[01:07:33.681 --> 01:07:34.642]  The second buzzword.
[01:07:35.263 --> 01:07:38.546]  Turmoil in the Middle East two years from now.
[01:07:39.927 --> 01:07:41.028]  The next buzzword.
[01:07:41.608 --> 01:07:45.652]  Iran's external enemy, Israel.
[01:07:46.713 --> 01:07:48.174]  I wrote these down as he was saying them.
[01:07:48.635 --> 01:07:49.455]  Another buzzword.
[01:07:49.956 --> 01:07:55.801]  Crude oil will stay $70 to $50 until the next crisis in the Middle East.
[01:07:57.222 --> 01:08:01.564]  The next buzzword, nearly everyone will be working for the government.
[01:08:01.664 --> 01:08:04.826]  And what's the first thing that pops into your mind when you hear something like that?
[01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:06.987]  Communism.
[01:08:08.248 --> 01:08:08.528]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.328 --> 01:08:10.509]  I mean, total control.
[01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.749]  And war.
[01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:13.010]  War.
[01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.570]  Listen to this.
[01:08:13.871 --> 01:08:15.331]  War brought the country out of the first one.
[01:08:15.371 --> 01:08:16.592]  Turmoil in the Middle East.
[01:08:16.672 --> 01:08:19.153]  Iran's external enemy, Israel.
[01:08:19.553 --> 01:08:20.034]  Crude oil.
[01:08:20.334 --> 01:08:24.476]  Stay there until the Middle East crisis, and they already have it planned.
[01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:28.612]  You remember back two years ago, Alex, and I said this on your show.
[01:08:29.153 --> 01:08:33.094]  He said, we don't want war with Iran.
[01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:38.276]  And here, all of our battleships were lined up over in the Persian Gulf.
[01:08:39.037 --> 01:08:41.318]  They were on, ready and alert.
[01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:42.998]  Everything was right, ready.
[01:08:43.318 --> 01:08:44.399]  The Air Force,
[01:08:45.003 --> 01:09:05.991]  Man, we had nearly everything in the way of Alma, right over there in the Middle East, ready for something to take place in the Strait of Hormuz, and then this man told... I was predicting it, as was most other talk show hosts, that we were going to have war with Iran in the very near term, and that was a year and a half ago, and this man said to me, we do not want war with Iran.
[01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:12.274]  I came on radio talk shows, and some of the talk show hosts got upset at me, because they were saying, we're going to have war with Iran,
[01:09:12.674 --> 01:09:15.937]  And I said, this man said, we don't want war with Iran right now.
[01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:20.120]  Now he turns around and he says, we've extended our timeline.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.381]  And he says, here's the new timeline.
[01:09:22.762 --> 01:09:28.426]  And he says, Iran is in the picture, but it's in the picture for approximately two years from now.
[01:09:28.806 --> 01:09:29.587]  So I'm warning you.
[01:09:30.397 --> 01:09:40.644]  What we thought was going to take place a year and a half to two years ago, you've got it down the line two years from now, and it's going to break out and spread all over the world at the time it happens.
[01:09:41.004 --> 01:09:47.189]  And he used buzzwords that indicated to me that they have something definitely in the wind for that period of time.
[01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:50.311]  I'm just telling you what this gentleman says.
[01:09:50.771 --> 01:09:54.814]  Believe me, for 35 years, all I have ever done is voiced
[01:09:55.402 --> 01:10:00.383]  What the elite have told me, I'm just a little everyday sort of a guy.
[01:10:00.843 --> 01:10:11.085]  Believe me, I am not a prophet, but everything that these people have said for the past 35 years has taken place, and you can believe it, this is going to take place also.
[01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:16.527]  Well, Lindsey, let's go back to this taking over the preachers and the devil's messiah.
[01:10:16.567 --> 01:10:17.667]  What was he saying that was?
[01:10:18.444 --> 01:10:23.229]  Well, we came around to how that all of this is coming about.
[01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:30.636]  Whenever he said that within two years you'll be so broke you won't be able to rebel against America, against the elite, excuse me.
[01:10:31.057 --> 01:10:40.206]  America will not be able to rebel against the elite, and down to the fact that they have two years and the dollar basically will be a thing of the past.
[01:10:40.746 --> 01:10:57.771]  Well, we went through all of these two-year things, and naturally, being a pastor, I went back at that point and said to him, I said, and I called him by name, I said, do you remember at Prudhoe Bay, when Speedy Jones came to know Christ as the Savior, and how it literally turned Prudhoe Bay upside down?
[01:10:57.831 --> 01:11:04.914]  I thought I'd get him on this subject, and I really wasn't asking him for things in the religious world, but he said, Chaplain, I do remember that.
[01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:07.254]  He said, you were having 400, 450 men out to the worship service.
[01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:16.578]  At Pump Station One, and he said, yes, Petey Jones, with Houston Constructors, really did turn the North Polk of Alaska upside down.
[01:11:17.098 --> 01:11:20.759]  And he said, then he got on the subject of religion.
[01:11:20.879 --> 01:11:22.560]  I wasn't expecting him to do it.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.501]  And he used the expression, the devil's messiah.
[01:11:25.761 --> 01:11:30.322]  And I asked him to kind of elaborate a little bit about what he was talking about.
[01:11:30.702 --> 01:11:35.104]  And he went into the details as to what they've done to the churches and the pastors of America.
[01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:36.746]  Stay there, Lindsey.
[01:11:36.766 --> 01:11:39.349]  We're going to come right back in with the Devil's Messiah.
[01:11:39.369 --> 01:11:40.010]  Stay with us.
[01:11:52.367 --> 01:12:00.771]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:06.754]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:12:07.054 --> 01:12:13.597]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:12:14.157 --> 01:12:17.421]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:12:17.561 --> 01:12:19.803]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:26.370]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:29.933]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:12:30.133 --> 01:12:33.997]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.122]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.404]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:45.886]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[01:12:46.186 --> 01:12:51.230]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:12:52.391 --> 01:12:57.735]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the devil's spear.
[01:12:58.195 --> 01:13:05.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:13:05.794 --> 01:13:11.977]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:14.219]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:14.359 --> 01:13:16.760]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:27.826]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:13:28.428 --> 01:13:29.728]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:30.088 --> 01:13:31.469]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:38.290]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:46.632]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:48.273]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:48.693 --> 01:13:49.873]  The people strike back.
[01:13:52.358 --> 01:13:53.800]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.420]  October 19th, 2009.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.521]  Gold opened this morning at $10.53.70.
[01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:59.085]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.82.93, $5.41.47 for a half ounce, or $2.70.73 for a quarter ounce.
[01:13:59.125 --> 01:13:59.786]  That's at $10.82.93, $5.41.47, and $2.70.73.
[01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:25.332]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:14:25.432 --> 01:14:34.021]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.222]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:14:35.342 --> 01:14:39.505]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:14:39.705 --> 01:14:40.665]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:40.805 --> 01:14:41.806]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:14:41.826 --> 01:14:42.006]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:42.066 --> 01:14:42.467]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:14:42.487 --> 01:14:43.927]  When you hear the words water purification,
[01:14:57.318 --> 01:14:57.618]  I think so.
[01:15:12.122 --> 01:15:17.984]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:22.785]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[01:15:23.105 --> 01:15:29.307]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.
[01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:35.889]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[01:15:36.349 --> 01:15:39.012]  And ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[01:15:41.854 --> 01:15:43.796]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:15:43.816 --> 01:15:44.576]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:45.257]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[01:16:09.931 --> 01:16:18.933]  Makes me very angry to see humanity who's good and decent, and the average person is loving and has hopes and dreams, manipulated by the scientific dictatorship.
[01:16:21.354 --> 01:16:22.894]  Pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[01:16:22.934 --> 01:16:26.495]  Lindsey, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, but I want
[01:16:27.748 --> 01:16:31.350]  What Alex Jones says in his new DVD, and I haven't seen it yet.
[01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:33.070]  Alex, I'm sure you're looking forward to it.
[01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:34.171]  I guarantee you
[01:16:55.666 --> 01:17:02.268]  That what this man told me is going to back up every single thing that Alex Jones says in his new DVD.
[01:17:02.968 --> 01:17:08.489]  He went into the subject, as Alex just suggested, he wants to keep me on the subject of the Devil's Messiah.
[01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:23.473]  Have you been asked by your church and your pastor lately to fill out a form in which it asks very personal questions and they say that they'd like it for the purpose of being able to know more about the people in the church?
[01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:25.772]  Yes, it's happening everywhere.
[01:17:26.673 --> 01:17:28.694]  You better be careful, folks.
[01:17:29.155 --> 01:17:37.441]  Did you realize that this is, uh, that Homeland Security has, oh my goodness, I wish I had time to go into Homeland Security, but I can't.
[01:17:37.662 --> 01:17:38.242]  No, you do!
[01:17:38.322 --> 01:17:39.123]  Go over it, go!
[01:17:39.203 --> 01:17:39.883]  Just tell us.
[01:17:39.923 --> 01:17:50.412]  That Homeland Security has actually requested of the pastors to get this information and to make it available to them at any such time that they might want it.
[01:17:50.912 --> 01:17:53.073]  And they ask personal questions.
[01:17:53.113 --> 01:17:56.774]  Your salary, the number of people in your house, the number of computers you have.
[01:17:57.314 --> 01:17:58.194]  On and on and on.
[01:17:58.874 --> 01:17:59.694]  I attended a church.
[01:17:59.854 --> 01:18:01.455]  We just came back, as I mentioned to you.
[01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:02.575]  Three months, I disappeared.
[01:18:02.875 --> 01:18:03.875]  Literally disappeared.
[01:18:03.915 --> 01:18:06.676]  I haven't done a single radio talk show up until today.
[01:18:06.696 --> 01:18:08.877]  Alex, I guess that's the reason I'm so excited.
[01:18:09.257 --> 01:18:12.358]  Because I have a privilege of giving out what this man just told me.
[01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:14.238]  Your show being the very first one.
[01:18:14.638 --> 01:18:17.399]  And I was in a church in the course of our travels.
[01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:21.382]  And this church asked the people to fill out this brochure.
[01:18:21.602 --> 01:18:23.503]  And I looked at it and almost gagged.
[01:18:23.523 --> 01:18:25.685]  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
[01:18:26.005 --> 01:18:33.011]  It's exactly what Homeland Security has requested of the pastors to be able to... Hey, it's worse than that, Lindsey.
[01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.613]  We're the ones that broke three years ago on Genesis.
[01:18:35.653 --> 01:18:36.994]  Pastor Butch Poff did first.
[01:18:37.634 --> 01:18:40.357]  The clergy response team's secret documents.
[01:18:40.677 --> 01:18:41.718]  Tell your flocks Roman 13.
[01:18:42.338 --> 01:18:43.480]  Tell them give their guns up.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.481]  Tell them take forced inoculations.
[01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.023]  Tell them world government's good.
[01:18:47.503 --> 01:18:49.485]  Tell them to worship whoever the president is.
[01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:52.928]  Then it came out mainstream news that our documents were real.
[01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.109]  People couldn't believe it.
[01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:59.334]  Just Google Clergy Response Teams, you can watch newscasts, everything, saying, yeah, we're getting you ready to go to the camps.
[01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:03.577]  They actually say, the camps, and how it's of the Lord to go to the camps.
[01:19:04.278 --> 01:19:07.341]  Very, very, like Communist China or Russia using the churches.
[01:19:07.961 --> 01:19:12.985]  And then, one of my friends brought me from Dripping Springs, Big Baptist Church,
[01:19:13.926 --> 01:19:14.767]  They got ordered.
[01:19:14.827 --> 01:19:20.231]  You don't talk about politics with anybody at the church, even when you're eating dinner with them.
[01:19:20.671 --> 01:19:22.593]  You shut up and do what the government says.
[01:19:22.673 --> 01:19:23.974]  These are prison grids.
[01:19:24.374 --> 01:19:26.076]  You talk about devilish, go ahead.
[01:19:26.996 --> 01:19:29.038]  Please folks, I beg of you.
[01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:37.017]  If you even attend any kind of church at all, I don't care what it is, please give my DVD to the pastors of your church.
[01:19:37.177 --> 01:19:37.897]  I beg of you.
[01:19:38.217 --> 01:19:41.060]  Now, we have put this in a beautiful folder.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.361]  This is not like I used to do, Dorky.
[01:19:43.441 --> 01:19:47.204]  I know in the past we've had very dorky DVDs, but not this time.
[01:19:47.604 --> 01:19:51.647]  I said the whole country has got to be so attractive that everybody will want it.
[01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:57.752]  We put all six of them into one beautiful folder with a multi-cover cover on the back and the front.
[01:19:58.072 --> 01:19:59.613]  You've never seen anything so nice.
[01:19:59.773 --> 01:20:01.153]  Anybody would want it.
[01:20:01.494 --> 01:20:02.574]  Give it to your pastor.
[01:20:02.854 --> 01:20:03.394]  I beg of you.
[01:20:03.634 --> 01:20:05.875]  He will actually look at this one and want it.
[01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:08.817]  Okay, we're going to fire the number out, but here's my question.
[01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:10.898]  I know insiders leak info.
[01:20:10.938 --> 01:20:18.701]  Is he telling you this because he thinks there's nothing anybody can do, or is it because of his conscience believing he's going to die soon?
[01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:20.282]  A little bit of both.
[01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:25.744]  I think he did it mainly because of his conscience, and I think he did it, as he said,
[01:20:26.508 --> 01:20:34.330]  He said, you Americans, he said you have fallen for every line, for every carrot we've put in front of you.
[01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:39.531]  You've swallowed hook, line, and sinker everything we have said, and they are laughing!
[01:20:39.551 --> 01:20:47.193]  And he's telling you this because you were his pastor with the oil company, and he knows if you say you won't speak with the pastor
[01:20:47.953 --> 01:20:48.674]  I don't think so.
[01:21:02.841 --> 01:21:06.304]  I understand of course that they do not have chaplains on pipelines.
[01:21:06.424 --> 01:21:08.066]  They've never known them any place in the world.
[01:21:08.126 --> 01:21:12.270]  The only time this has happened to my knowledge is on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:18.296]  I probably am one of the only people of his kind that has ever personally
[01:21:19.431 --> 01:21:31.859]  Man-to-man, eyeball-to-eyeball, face-to-face, day-after-day, been in the presence of this man, and it gained a sense of confidence that probably... I understand, you're like his counselor.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.060]  Stay there, Lindsey.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:41.725]  I want to come back and get into the Homeland Security, get into more of this religious stuff, because I want to hear his view on that when you brought it up, and then more.
[01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:43.387]  We're on the march.
[01:21:43.887 --> 01:21:45.388]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:46.383 --> 01:21:49.165]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:51.867 --> 01:21:56.110]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:21:56.431 --> 01:22:00.474]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:06.178]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:06.518 --> 01:22:11.802]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:12.122 --> 01:22:12.643]  Number 3.
[01:22:12.943 --> 01:22:16.226]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:22:16.526 --> 01:22:20.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.991]  Number 4.
[01:22:21.231 --> 01:22:23.613]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:22:24.014 --> 01:22:27.337]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:32.379]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:37.380]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.682]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:22:41.822 --> 01:22:43.402]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:48.224]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:22:53.061 --> 01:22:58.322]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:59.111 --> 01:23:04.455]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:23:04.975 --> 01:23:11.180]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.301]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:13.461 --> 01:23:15.843]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:23:15.923 --> 01:23:26.811]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:23:29.091 --> 01:23:30.372]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:30.752 --> 01:23:32.173]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:32.613 --> 01:23:38.936]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:47.320]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.941]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:50.562]  The people strike back.
[01:23:52.313 --> 01:23:53.955]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[01:23:54.075 --> 01:23:55.516]  Say no to toxic overload.
[01:23:55.596 --> 01:23:56.677]  Say no to chemicals.
[01:23:56.917 --> 01:23:58.719]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[01:23:58.859 --> 01:24:07.607]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[01:24:07.667 --> 01:24:12.932]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[01:24:13.072 --> 01:24:14.694]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[01:24:14.874 --> 01:24:22.283]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[01:25:07.955 --> 01:25:16.461]  Okay.
[01:25:17.161 --> 01:25:18.742]  I got some sponsors we need to thank.
[01:25:20.303 --> 01:25:21.624]  I said I'd get into carbon tax.
[01:25:21.644 --> 01:25:23.966]  I may have to do this at the beginning of the show tomorrow.
[01:25:24.026 --> 01:25:29.609]  It's just they're openly announcing they're gonna not just tax you, they're gonna make you get permission to travel.
[01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:31.050]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:25:32.571 --> 01:25:33.892]  I mean, it's worse than I thought.
[01:25:33.912 --> 01:25:36.754]  I mean, I knew that was down the road, but they're coming right out with it.
[01:25:39.987 --> 01:25:40.807]  It is so amazing.
[01:25:40.847 --> 01:25:43.528]  Lindsey will be on with us 30 minutes into the show tomorrow.
[01:25:44.249 --> 01:25:45.689]  Man, I've never heard him so speechless.
[01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:49.130]  We're going to go over all his list into more detail.
[01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:54.672]  During the break, he was just telling me more about what this guy was telling him about the world government religion.
[01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:56.873]  These people are out of their minds.
[01:25:57.433 --> 01:26:00.194]  I wanted to cover some economic news and also thank some of the sponsors.
[01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:08.577]  It's super high quality atmospheric water generator and the special deal ends today.
[01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:11.661]  It ends today at five or six o'clock central.
[01:26:11.681 --> 01:26:19.791]  We're actually on the west coast but I know at five today it closes so I guess it's seven o'clock here central and I guess
[01:26:22.233 --> 01:26:23.894]  It'll end at like 8 or 9 o'clock Eastern.
[01:26:23.914 --> 01:26:35.018]  The point is, acolablue.com, you can get more than 20% off what it comes down to on their Acola Blue 28, their base unit that does 7.5 gallons a day, the one I have in the office in my home.
[01:26:35.438 --> 01:26:41.661]  acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, or give them a call at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:26:41.741 --> 01:26:43.822]  It grabs water out of the air.
[01:26:43.842 --> 01:26:46.103]  It's like a water cooler without the water bottle on the top.
[01:26:46.543 --> 01:26:48.263]  Has a nice computer readout on the front.
[01:26:48.624 --> 01:26:50.084]  Stainless steel container.
[01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:50.784]  It holds it in.
[01:26:50.804 --> 01:26:51.804]  Goes through seven filters.
[01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:57.106]  acolablue.com Continuing, diginet.net.
[01:26:57.186 --> 01:27:01.567]  In these insane times, everybody needs a hidden video camera.
[01:27:01.747 --> 01:27:05.988]  It's like when the cops run this guy over on this latest video that I'll play while Lindsey's talking.
[01:27:07.128 --> 01:27:10.869]  They kill him and then they run up and start confiscating all the cameras, everybody, threatening him.
[01:27:12.932 --> 01:27:13.693]  Just amazing.
[01:27:14.073 --> 01:27:15.735]  Everybody needs a Diginet.net pin.
[01:27:15.755 --> 01:27:18.818]  They got hidden sunglasses, hidden pins, other systems.
[01:27:18.858 --> 01:27:21.941]  Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:27:22.442 --> 01:27:27.006]  It's got time and date stamp on it, so it's admissible in court.
[01:27:27.547 --> 01:27:30.610]  This is what all good people need to fight Big Brother with their own system.
[01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:32.251]  Diginet.net.
[01:27:32.351 --> 01:27:34.594]  Because when they're in the wrong, they always say it malfunctioned.
[01:27:35.529 --> 01:27:42.395]  DigiNet.net, or give them a call at 888-344-6681.
[01:27:42.415 --> 01:27:43.075]  888-344-6681.
[01:27:43.956 --> 01:27:45.978]  Fabulous folks at DigiNet.net.
[01:27:46.939 --> 01:27:54.625]  And a lot of these videos are getting shot, like these National Guard videos of checkpoints popping up around the country being shot with DigiNet.net pins.
[01:27:55.426 --> 01:27:59.849]  Continuing, I want to thank efoodsdirect.com for making today's show possible.
[01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:01.631]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:28:03.356 --> 01:28:05.437]  We now have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[01:28:05.477 --> 01:28:10.500]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect.com, is the longest-standingly operating herbal foods company in the nation.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.922]  They have high-quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, and they have organic.
[01:28:13.942 --> 01:28:15.883]  They have purely organic food lines if you want them.
[01:28:16.283 --> 01:28:23.007]  Very inexpensive, super high-quality, recently, as in the last month, packaged here in the U.S., not a bunch of crud.
[01:28:23.267 --> 01:28:24.388]  This is who I trust.
[01:28:24.768 --> 01:28:27.290]  eFoodsDirect.com, big banners on InfoWars.
[01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:28.250]  We're good to go.
[01:28:52.145 --> 01:28:53.426]  We're going to continue here.
[01:28:53.967 --> 01:28:58.552]  I want to go to Ted Anderson just for three minutes, and then we're going back to Lindsey Williams.
[01:28:59.352 --> 01:29:04.578]  But I wanted to get Ted on because gold is continuing to move up.
[01:29:04.978 --> 01:29:07.481]  It's up at an all-time record high again today.
[01:29:09.263 --> 01:29:09.943]  It's been up above $1,060.
[01:29:12.321 --> 01:29:13.642]  The writing is on the wall.
[01:29:13.702 --> 01:29:19.544]  They might hammer it back down again below a thousand, but then next time it'll go up to a thousand one hundred.
[01:29:19.924 --> 01:29:24.126]  And then down to a thousand and a thousand two hundred, to a thousand one hundred, a thousand three hundred.
[01:29:24.426 --> 01:29:25.367]  These are the ceilings.
[01:29:26.307 --> 01:29:30.209]  Mainline experts on Bloomberg and CNBC are saying two thousand.
[01:29:30.589 --> 01:29:31.410]  I'm not saying that.
[01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:32.430]  Let me tell you something.
[01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:33.470]  I bought most of my gold.
[01:29:33.491 --> 01:29:37.092]  I don't have much, but I got some in a safety deposit box, you know, stuff like that.
[01:29:37.592 --> 01:29:38.493]  And I got a lot of silver.
[01:29:39.113 --> 01:29:41.494]  And that's also, people say, well, that's not safe either.
[01:29:41.534 --> 01:29:42.355]  It's a deposit box.
[01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:43.336]  Well, that's where I keep it.
[01:29:43.416 --> 01:29:47.658]  You know, the point is that you can go bury it if you want.
[01:29:47.698 --> 01:29:53.081]  The point here is, is that I'm not selling silver.
[01:29:53.141 --> 01:29:55.123]  I bought it $5 an ounce and gold.
[01:29:55.183 --> 01:29:55.563]  I bought it 300.
[01:29:56.744 --> 01:29:57.624]  I'm not selling it.
[01:29:58.785 --> 01:30:00.026]  It's insurance folks.
[01:30:00.886 --> 01:30:05.249]  But for insurance, there's few things you invest in as insurance.
[01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:11.538]  And then on top of it also as an investment, as one of the hottest investments.
[01:30:13.118 --> 01:30:14.779]  Paper is a fraud.
[01:30:14.859 --> 01:30:20.761]  The globalists are using paper, they create to buy the world, then they destroy their own paper with us left holding the bag.
[01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.022]  I'm gonna bring Ted up.
[01:30:22.082 --> 01:30:28.064]  Now I haven't asked Ted yet today if he's run out of gold he bought at the $1,000 level and silver he bought at the $12 level.
[01:30:28.424 --> 01:30:34.927]  I know he told me last Friday when I bought another little bag of silver that he was almost out of that if I wanted any more.
[01:30:36.408 --> 01:30:40.452]  Because that's what I keep as my emergency nest egg and for this company to operate on.
[01:30:40.772 --> 01:30:43.795]  And more and more we try to keep money in the bank as operating capital.
[01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:46.377]  I'm trying to shift it out because who knows if that'll be there.
[01:30:46.718 --> 01:30:48.079]  We won't be able to operate here.
[01:30:48.099 --> 01:30:49.040]  We have huge overhead.
[01:30:50.014 --> 01:30:52.995]  The issue here is, that's why we're always also having sponsors on.
[01:30:53.575 --> 01:30:55.376]  I'm not funded by the New World Order.
[01:30:55.396 --> 01:30:56.977]  I'm funded by me and my sponsors.
[01:30:57.537 --> 01:30:59.258]  You buying the DVDs, the sponsors.
[01:30:59.278 --> 01:31:01.419]  That's why I forget at the end of the show to even plug them.
[01:31:01.439 --> 01:31:03.420]  They all come at once, but please support them.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.821]  Ted, I need to go back to Lindsey Williams.
[01:31:05.841 --> 01:31:08.162]  This is super hot, but I appreciate you coming on and waiting.
[01:31:10.302 --> 01:31:13.424]  Ted, what gold and silver do you have now at that lower price?
[01:31:15.157 --> 01:31:15.998]  It keeps going up.
[01:31:16.058 --> 01:31:17.259]  People need to take advantage of this.
[01:31:17.679 --> 01:31:18.720]  Yeah, gold is up today.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.081]  The dollar's dropping again today.
[01:31:20.121 --> 01:31:21.602]  Very sad day for the dollar.
[01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:26.305]  But gold is going up, up $7.00 and some odd cents today already.
[01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:33.531]  And the gold that I'm using right now, the stuff that I have that's trading at that $1,000 level is the British Sovereigns and the Franks.
[01:31:34.011 --> 01:31:34.492]  They're at $2.93 and $2.38.
[01:31:37.468 --> 01:31:40.911]  I'm not going to say a whole lot about this just because I don't have a whole lot left.
[01:31:40.971 --> 01:31:43.153]  And that would be the $10 Liberty.
[01:31:43.233 --> 01:31:44.814]  We have those at $8.18.50.
[01:31:46.035 --> 01:31:47.917]  Walking Liberty halves without a question.
[01:31:47.997 --> 01:31:50.719]  Still, Alex, I'm still offering those at $8.69.
[01:31:51.359 --> 01:31:56.804]  That is just an incredible, incredible buy with where silver is at right now.
[01:31:57.384 --> 01:31:59.146]  So I'd recommend that people get into that.
[01:32:00.106 --> 01:32:01.708]  Tarik, what is silver right now?
[01:32:02.128 --> 01:32:03.449]  Well, silver is $17.
[01:32:03.949 --> 01:32:04.510]  Hang on a second.
[01:32:04.530 --> 01:32:09.773]  Let me just get the latest price for you real quick because, you know, it changes so fast.
[01:32:10.234 --> 01:32:11.795]  It's $17.70.
[01:32:12.175 --> 01:32:13.436]  $17.71 right now is what I show.
[01:32:14.076 --> 01:32:17.459]  So, you know, the market is real hot in that area as well.
[01:32:18.519 --> 01:32:22.182]  It's just been a really strong, strong market.
[01:32:22.882 --> 01:32:26.845]  Just like Lindsey is saying, the dollar is losing value.
[01:32:27.385 --> 01:32:29.727]  It's going to lose value and it's losing it fast.
[01:32:29.967 --> 01:32:31.848]  I really don't want to interrupt Lindsey Williams.
[01:32:31.868 --> 01:32:33.289]  He's got such great information.
[01:32:33.729 --> 01:32:38.111]  But I can tell you, if you're looking to buy gold and silver, I don't know why you wouldn't be.
[01:32:38.131 --> 01:32:42.732]  I mean, if you have money in the stocks, the banks, CDs, I mean, you can just name it.
[01:32:42.772 --> 01:32:46.513]  If it's sitting, you know, in annuities, I mean, where are you gonna be?
[01:32:46.533 --> 01:32:47.754]  I mean, all this stuff is...
[01:32:48.737 --> 01:32:51.239]  You know, price based upon paper currency.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:57.505]  Gold and silver is money and has been money for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:32:58.866 --> 01:33:07.533]  It dates back to pre-Bank of England times before the Bank of England even started to print fiat currency, you know?
[01:33:07.553 --> 01:33:09.015]  I mean this is just
[01:33:10.393 --> 01:33:11.834]  You know, a no-brainer.
[01:33:12.094 --> 01:33:13.456]  People should be in gold and silver.
[01:33:13.476 --> 01:33:13.896]  Absolutely.
[01:33:13.936 --> 01:33:15.737]  What are the Franks at in the Sovereigns?
[01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:16.878]  I like the Sovereigns.
[01:33:17.038 --> 01:33:19.160]  Currently, the Frank right now is at $238.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.282]  The Sovereign right now is at $293.
[01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:24.084]  So that's still the lower price?
[01:33:24.384 --> 01:33:25.685]  It is still the lower price.
[01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:26.826]  How long can you hold that?
[01:33:26.866 --> 01:33:27.747]  When are you running out?
[01:33:29.248 --> 01:33:34.993]  Again, if I start breaking that $1,070 and my supply, it's just going to dry up.
[01:33:35.413 --> 01:33:39.016]  I'm hoping, remember you said that you thought maybe gold would hit below $1,000 an ounce again?
[01:33:40.857 --> 01:33:47.698]  I am just salivating, hoping to get that possibility, because when that does happen, I'm going to be buying hands down.
[01:33:47.718 --> 01:33:52.259]  Well, it appears it's found the new bottom at $1,040 to $1,060.
[01:33:52.439 --> 01:33:53.759]  It's just sitting there.
[01:33:54.159 --> 01:33:54.880]  Here's the number.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:55.800]  Folks are there.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.160]  This is a time machine.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:06.742]  You can go back in time and get gold and silver from a silver market at $12 and change when it's at $12.17, when it's at $17 and change.
[01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:17.779]  And gold, when it was at the 1,000 level, when it's at 1,060, I mean, you cannot beat this type of deal if you're getting into precious metals.
[01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:21.052]  686-2237.
[01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:21.332]  800-686-2237.
[01:34:21.392 --> 01:34:28.096]  Ted probably won't be able to hold this deal much longer.
[01:34:28.236 --> 01:34:28.956]  Give him a call.
[01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:31.157]  Tell him it's the Alex Jones Special.
[01:34:31.177 --> 01:34:32.958]  800-686-2237.
[01:34:33.098 --> 01:34:35.840]  Ted, thank you so much for being on with us.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:41.703]  Well, thanks for having me up, and of course, thank the listeners for being so supportive of the Genesis Network and Midas.
[01:34:41.904 --> 01:34:42.744]  I really appreciate it.
[01:34:43.084 --> 01:34:43.685]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:48.415]  Alex, the elite said to me, gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[01:34:48.515 --> 01:34:49.296]  Those are his words.
[01:35:07.836 --> 01:35:09.937]  And he said, this is our currency.
[01:35:10.818 --> 01:35:15.421]  Almost as if the American people have got the paper and the elite have got the gold and silver.
[01:35:15.821 --> 01:35:17.402]  He said, this is our currency.
[01:35:18.095 --> 01:35:20.196]  He said, gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[01:35:20.616 --> 01:35:23.277]  Two years from now, the dollar will be zilch.
[01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:24.497]  It will be dead.
[01:35:24.517 --> 01:35:27.458]  His exact words were, the dollar will be dead.
[01:35:28.158 --> 01:35:35.281]  Is there any way to, and by the way, just for you, you've only given your number out once, and we're getting emails and calls asking for that toll-free number.
[01:35:35.761 --> 01:35:37.242]  Everybody get your pens and paper ready.
[01:35:37.262 --> 01:35:40.903]  At the end, he'll give it out three times in a row if you want the new
[01:35:42.562 --> 01:35:44.383]  He just did where he lays this all out.
[01:35:44.644 --> 01:35:45.444]  He rushed out.
[01:35:45.744 --> 01:35:46.785]  Lindsey wants to retire.
[01:35:47.025 --> 01:35:47.966]  How old are you, Lindsey?
[01:35:49.426 --> 01:35:50.967]  73, but I'm not going to retire, Alex.
[01:35:51.047 --> 01:35:51.448]  I can't.
[01:35:51.508 --> 01:35:53.329]  There's too much exciting happening out here.
[01:35:53.349 --> 01:35:54.570]  Well, you're doing a great job.
[01:35:54.610 --> 01:36:00.393]  Well, you look younger than 73, but the point is, I know you got this info, so you've rushed out and you're doing this.
[01:36:00.413 --> 01:36:08.018]  We're going to tell people how to get this and get it out to everybody at the end of the show, but just in the time we have left before tomorrow, we're going to go into more depth.
[01:36:08.038 --> 01:36:09.559]  30 minutes into the start of the show, 1130 Central, 930 Pacific.
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:12.480]  I don't
[01:36:34.475 --> 01:36:37.617]  Uh, that they plan to destroy Barack Obama.
[01:36:37.978 --> 01:36:42.921]  Obviously they build him up, they destroy him, uh, or what your inside intel is on that?
[01:36:43.922 --> 01:36:46.123]  Well, two years ago, let's begin with Mr. Obama.
[01:36:46.964 --> 01:36:48.905]  Uh, then I'll go back into the other part also.
[01:36:49.485 --> 01:36:52.948]  Uh, two years ago he said to me, he said McCain is our man.
[01:36:52.988 --> 01:36:54.189]  That was prior to the election.
[01:36:55.029 --> 01:36:57.791]  And I kept making the statement that McCain was going to be elected.
[01:36:57.831 --> 01:36:58.972]  Well, that isn't what he said.
[01:37:00.116 --> 01:37:10.724]  And I'm learning more and more to stick with his exact words, because these people are very precise in the way they word things, and that's the reason I've read some of his works today, such as the one about gold and silver.
[01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.947]  He said, gold and silver, all you can rely on.
[01:37:14.427 --> 01:37:21.252]  Now, he didn't say where it was going, he didn't say $2,000 an ounce, but you read between the lines, and you get it for yourself.
[01:37:21.332 --> 01:37:24.635]  Now, they said two years ago, McCain is all a man.
[01:37:25.174 --> 01:37:26.797]  Well, I said McCain's going to be elected.
[01:37:26.837 --> 01:37:29.382]  That is what he said when he was not elected.
[01:37:29.402 --> 01:37:36.676]  I asked him about that this time, and oh my goodness, Alex, did I get an earful.
[01:37:37.409 --> 01:37:40.912]  Yes, they did want McCain in, and they expected to get him.
[01:37:41.033 --> 01:37:44.156]  But keep in mind, these people are not divine.
[01:37:44.516 --> 01:37:45.937]  They don't always get what they want.
[01:37:45.977 --> 01:37:48.920]  Americans, you still have time to rise up and opt.
[01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:50.742]  Well, Lindsey, let me stop you, though.
[01:37:51.903 --> 01:37:57.609]  There's one elite, but kind of like at a Mafia Commission meeting, they're all LaCosa Nostra, but they're different families.
[01:37:58.675 --> 01:38:05.701]  I know there's a Hegelian dialectic of the Fabian Socialist and then a more rabid group.
[01:38:06.441 --> 01:38:09.384]  Could you not be talking to one arm of the New World Order?
[01:38:09.704 --> 01:38:11.966]  Because also a lot of elites wanted Obama.
[01:38:14.048 --> 01:38:15.889]  Well, let's kind of get a pecking order here.
[01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:19.172]  You start out with probably no more than a dozen people.
[01:38:20.153 --> 01:38:22.074]  And at the very top, you know who they are.
[01:38:22.975 --> 01:38:24.596]  George Bush Senior, Danny Bush.
[01:38:25.317 --> 01:38:27.659]  You could not get any more elite of the elite.
[01:38:28.246 --> 01:38:29.506]  He's in the second tier!
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.601]  He probably is, if I could guess.
[01:38:58.141 --> 01:39:01.763]  Because he knows what goes on in the meetings.
[01:39:01.863 --> 01:39:06.364]  He knows the meetings like you attended and viewed them from the outside.
[01:39:06.404 --> 01:39:08.225]  He knows what goes on in those sort of meetings.
[01:39:09.145 --> 01:39:11.286]  So yeah, he's pretty close down the line.
[01:39:11.706 --> 01:39:14.888]  Now, these people expected McCain to get in.
[01:39:14.948 --> 01:39:16.208]  They wanted McCain in.
[01:39:16.568 --> 01:39:18.389]  They financed McCain's program.
[01:39:19.065 --> 01:39:22.367]  And now that they got Obama, they've got trouble.
[01:39:22.407 --> 01:39:23.307]  Obama's got trouble.
[01:39:24.228 --> 01:39:25.468]  Oh my goodness!
[01:39:27.129 --> 01:39:34.573]  He made it known to me that if Obama doesn't straighten out, and I'm not going to use the word over the air.
[01:39:34.673 --> 01:39:35.093]  I can't.
[01:39:36.254 --> 01:39:40.656]  They even told me in the studio this past week, the studio owner said, don't you dare say that here.
[01:39:40.996 --> 01:39:42.297]  He said, take that off the record.
[01:39:42.717 --> 01:39:43.738]  I'll just put it this way.
[01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:48.020]  If Obama doesn't straighten out and quit this haughty pride, arrogant,
[01:39:48.402 --> 01:39:52.084]  I'm not listening to them and doing things the way that he wants them done.
[01:39:52.104 --> 01:39:55.145]  He's in big trouble.
[01:39:55.685 --> 01:40:04.970]  Wait a minute, you're saying from your source that at least one big strata of the elite will just say it.
[01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:10.693]  They're saying that they may, he's saying the elite may do a JFK on Obama?
[01:40:12.854 --> 01:40:13.714]  You said it, I didn't.
[01:40:16.737 --> 01:40:18.398]  Well, no, I'm just reporting here.
[01:40:18.438 --> 01:40:22.982]  You're saying you have an inside source and that he's not saying he's going to do it.
[01:40:23.022 --> 01:40:29.547]  He's 80, almost 90, won't say his age, and he's just hearing that... Well, go ahead.
[01:40:30.408 --> 01:40:32.049]  Well, they aren't satisfied with this man.
[01:40:32.469 --> 01:40:37.013]  This man is jumping out and doing things without their permission.
[01:40:37.925 --> 01:40:41.770]  And he is in some real hot water if he keeps up the way he's going.
[01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:44.152]  In fact, it wouldn't surprise me anything.
[01:40:44.172 --> 01:40:47.035]  Now, in my DVD, I beg people.
[01:40:47.136 --> 01:40:49.198]  I say, don't you touch this man.
[01:40:49.758 --> 01:40:51.380]  None of you bunch of radicals out there.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.083]  And I know there's some real hotheads listening to the program today.
[01:40:54.364 --> 01:40:56.546]  Don't you dare go out there and do anything to this man.
[01:40:56.866 --> 01:40:58.028]  He's going to kill himself.
[01:40:58.448 --> 01:40:59.029]  He's going to...
[01:40:59.829 --> 01:41:02.611]  I'm sorry, I used the wrong word there.
[01:41:02.871 --> 01:41:09.015]  He is going to defeat himself in the very near future and don't you dare go out there and touch him.
[01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:11.337]  Because if you do, you'll make a hero out of him.
[01:41:11.357 --> 01:41:17.041]  But see, you may exactly, the elite love him from what I've seen and have built him up and given him Nobel Prizes.
[01:41:17.081 --> 01:41:18.102]  That's the elite of the elite.
[01:41:18.562 --> 01:41:25.446]  And the only way to make him a winner is to try something or hurt him that will then elevate him.
[01:41:26.267 --> 01:41:29.009]  Well, they buy him by giving him a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:41:29.819 --> 01:41:35.781]  Uh, they limit what he's able to do in certain areas by, uh, tying his hands.
[01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:41.383]  And so they're trying their best to tie him down so that they can get out of him what they want out of him.
[01:41:41.663 --> 01:41:47.585]  But this man is so unpredictable until even these people are having trouble with it.
[01:41:48.125 --> 01:41:52.667]  And it was indicated to me, uh, this guy better be very careful what he's doing.
[01:41:55.948 --> 01:41:57.589]  I mean, it's, it's, it's startling.
[01:42:00.125 --> 01:42:00.785]  It's dangerous.
[01:42:00.825 --> 01:42:02.307]  Now, let me get into the next subject.
[01:42:02.567 --> 01:42:04.949]  We'll touch on that maybe a little bit more, but you're right.
[01:42:05.469 --> 01:42:13.056]  Everything you just said, all of the in-between-the-lines folks, you just read what Alex just said, because that's exactly the way it is.
[01:42:13.096 --> 01:42:17.840]  Now, let's get down to the elite, and two statements here.
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:20.522]  First of all, the elite have a God.
[01:42:21.423 --> 01:42:29.233]  Remember when George Bush, our previous president, to Mr. Obama, he used to use the expression all the time, God bless you.
[01:42:30.054 --> 01:42:31.035]  Well, fine.
[01:42:31.535 --> 01:42:35.781]  But most pastors fell for that line and thought that he was talking about their God.
[01:42:36.842 --> 01:42:38.424]  But no, quite to the contrary.
[01:42:38.959 --> 01:42:41.200]  The true and living God of the Bible is one God.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.122]  The Bible talks about a second God.
[01:42:44.562 --> 01:42:45.122]  Stay there!
[01:42:45.522 --> 01:42:45.922]  Stay there!
[01:42:45.983 --> 01:42:47.583]  We may have to go into overdrive.
[01:42:47.623 --> 01:42:49.044]  He's back live with us tomorrow.
[01:42:49.344 --> 01:42:50.465]  He's Lindsey Williams.
[01:42:50.565 --> 01:42:51.105]  Stay with us.
[01:42:52.226 --> 01:42:53.726]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:42:53.906 --> 01:42:55.347]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:42:55.667 --> 01:42:57.888]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:42:58.349 --> 01:43:03.051]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:43:03.473 --> 01:43:06.315]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:43:52.762 --> 01:43:58.091]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:43:58.592 --> 01:44:05.623]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:06.172 --> 01:44:12.339]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:12.359 --> 01:44:14.581]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:17.144]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:17.224 --> 01:44:28.196]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:28.803 --> 01:44:30.084]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:31.844]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:32.325 --> 01:44:38.667]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:39.227 --> 01:44:47.031]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:47.491 --> 01:44:48.651]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:49.071 --> 01:44:50.252]  The people strike back.
[01:44:52.583 --> 01:44:59.188]  If you're tired of paying too much for gas, diesel, or heating oil, Future Fuel Technologies has the answer you're looking for.
[01:44:59.488 --> 01:45:01.229]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.
[01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:06.253]  FFT Fuel Saver is made using a patented formula that helps fuel burn cleaner, resulting
[01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:17.891]  I think so.
[01:45:47.403 --> 01:45:59.455]  Look, I'm gonna do ten minutes of overdrive.
[01:45:59.475 --> 01:46:04.461]  I'd do more, but I got radio and TV interviews lined up off and on during the day.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:12.563]  Also, they're over there building our new office in the space next door, but we've got to knock a hole from this office into the other office.
[01:46:13.024 --> 01:46:20.748]  I thought I would ceremonially, with a sledgehammer... Boy, it's some thick, thick, thick sheetrock.
[01:46:20.808 --> 01:46:24.050]  We'll see how wimpy I look banging that into the wall.
[01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:25.751]  It's not like regular sheetrock, man.
[01:46:25.771 --> 01:46:26.771]  This stuff's like that thick.
[01:46:27.331 --> 01:46:29.993]  I saw him in there with a sledgehammer a few months ago.
[01:46:30.013 --> 01:46:32.694]  I mean, it was just like... We'll see what happens.
[01:46:32.714 --> 01:46:35.156]  We'll see if I can man up and go through this wall.
[01:46:36.024 --> 01:46:37.786]  But there's some brick behind it, too.
[01:46:37.826 --> 01:46:38.266]  Center block.
[01:46:38.306 --> 01:46:39.847]  I'll be bashing the daylights out of that.
[01:46:40.388 --> 01:46:43.571]  By the way, it's just about 48 hours.
[01:46:43.691 --> 01:46:47.795]  Wednesday at 3 p.m.
[01:46:47.875 --> 01:46:50.637]  on the show in Central, we're going to release Follow the Republic.
[01:46:51.458 --> 01:46:52.299]  Follow the Republic.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.722]  And this film covers everything Lindsey's talking about.
[01:46:55.782 --> 01:47:02.208]  They are killing the dollar, killing our country, hardcore citizen spy rings, secret arrests, CPS.
[01:47:03.542 --> 01:47:08.765]  Brainwashed population, TV mind control, pre-order it at InfoWars.com today.
[01:47:08.785 --> 01:47:10.987]  It's not even pre-ordering, we start shipping tomorrow.
[01:47:12.248 --> 01:47:15.229]  Order the DVDs, you have it, high quality, you'll get it in a few days.
[01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:17.291]  UPS goes everywhere in the country in like three, four days.
[01:47:18.524 --> 01:47:19.765]  The problem is we've got thousands of orders.
[01:47:19.785 --> 01:47:22.566]  We've got to hurry and get them out, because the DVDs are coming in today.
[01:47:22.866 --> 01:47:23.547]  They're on their way here.
[01:47:23.567 --> 01:47:24.907]  They should probably already be back there in the back.
[01:47:25.568 --> 01:47:27.949]  But we've got a tracking number.
[01:47:28.009 --> 01:47:33.732]  The point is, I've already got some that we overnighted, but the point is, from the factory, get it!
[01:47:34.132 --> 01:47:34.713]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:47:34.733 --> 01:47:36.854]  These are the white blood cells against this disease of globalism.
[01:47:44.557 --> 01:47:51.019]  the films and and the power is not in me making a film and selling a few thousand copies the power
[01:47:52.213 --> 01:47:55.015]  I gotta sell 20,000 of these just to make my money back or more.
[01:47:55.255 --> 01:47:57.057]  Probably, who knows if I'll even do that.
[01:47:57.577 --> 01:47:58.558]  Probably in a year I will.
[01:47:58.598 --> 01:48:01.680]  The point is, the issue is, it's not about the money.
[01:48:02.301 --> 01:48:03.202]  It's about the future.
[01:48:03.442 --> 01:48:04.683]  It's about beating the globalists.
[01:48:04.743 --> 01:48:08.005]  And if you'll get the DVD, make copies, get out to people, it's unstoppable.
[01:48:08.246 --> 01:48:12.869]  It'll premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv, burn at the desk, get fired up, get amped up, get ready.
[01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:18.354]  Now I'm holding Lindsay over 10 minutes so we can finish up more of these key bullet points from this insider.
[01:48:18.874 --> 01:48:24.138]  But, Lindsey, before you forget, give folks the toll-free number to call and order your different DVD sets.
[01:48:24.458 --> 01:48:30.522]  And this latest one that is just finished today, you know, you shot it last week.
[01:48:31.563 --> 01:48:34.425]  Give people the numbers so they can call and get the latest DVD.
[01:48:35.326 --> 01:48:37.407]  The new toll-free number.
[01:48:37.627 --> 01:48:41.230]  We had to put on seven operators standing by waiting to take your call.
[01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:43.191]  The new toll-free number is 888-799-7000.
[01:48:49.138 --> 01:48:50.559]  6-1-1-1.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.440]  We'll give immediate shipment.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:54.141]  We'll ship UPS if you'd like.
[01:48:54.181 --> 01:48:55.182]  We'll ship Post Office.
[01:48:55.482 --> 01:48:57.183]  We want to get it to you as quick as we can.
[01:48:57.404 --> 01:48:58.604]  Six DVDs.
[01:48:58.624 --> 01:48:59.545]  You only buy three.
[01:48:59.865 --> 01:49:01.006]  We've reduced the price.
[01:49:01.766 --> 01:49:02.967]  Six DVDs.
[01:49:02.987 --> 01:49:06.450]  You buy three, we will give you three as a gift.
[01:49:06.570 --> 01:49:07.630]  Give them the number again.
[01:49:07.851 --> 01:49:08.831]  People just want the number.
[01:49:09.372 --> 01:49:09.932]  The number is 888.
[01:49:12.329 --> 01:49:13.710]  Okay, Lindsey, stay there.
[01:49:29.414 --> 01:49:30.114]  We've got a break.
[01:49:30.154 --> 01:49:32.496]  I want to come back in the final 10 minutes in overdrive.
[01:49:32.756 --> 01:49:34.456]  This will not be on your AM and FM dial.
[01:49:34.497 --> 01:49:35.737]  This will not be on Global Shortwave.
[01:49:36.057 --> 01:49:43.541]  It'll be on PrisonPlanet.tv, later put all over the world, but live right now, and the audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:43.581 --> 01:49:45.242]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:49:45.522 --> 01:49:48.303]  There's all these other affiliate and radio links and other streams.
[01:49:48.724 --> 01:49:49.884]  InfoWars.com.
[01:49:49.984 --> 01:49:53.286]  Click now to be able to hear the final 10 minutes, because Lindsey,
[01:49:53.886 --> 01:49:57.452]  I want you to... We've only covered, I know, a page or so of your notes.
[01:49:57.953 --> 01:50:01.238]  Give us a preview of what's coming up tomorrow, 30 minutes into the show.
[01:50:01.799 --> 01:50:03.101]  This is so important!
[01:50:03.602 --> 01:50:05.926]  I believe Lindsey, his info's proven to be accurate.
[01:50:06.247 --> 01:50:07.949]  He does talk to a top globalist.
[01:50:09.082 --> 01:50:14.565]  He made the prediction almost two years ago here on the show that oil would drop to below 50.
[01:50:14.725 --> 01:50:17.246]  It did that for a solid year, as he said.
[01:50:17.727 --> 01:50:20.548]  Now he's giving us the latest inside intel.
[01:50:20.908 --> 01:50:25.491]  This is just as important when Jim Tucker gives us inside intel from Mildenberg Group meetings.
[01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:27.112]  We're looking into the crystal ball.
[01:50:27.612 --> 01:50:29.013]  Maiden transmission's ending now.
[01:50:29.073 --> 01:50:29.873]  God bless you all.
[01:50:29.893 --> 01:50:31.874]  Let's go into retransmission.
[01:50:33.604 --> 01:50:35.331]  You are listening to GCN Live.
[01:50:35.391 --> 01:50:37.138]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:50:44.212 --> 01:50:49.453]  Businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:50:49.733 --> 01:50:55.515]  You can buy it at hereiswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:50:55.815 --> 01:50:58.515]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:50:58.776 --> 01:51:04.677]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:51:05.057 --> 01:51:06.478]  This book will work for anyone.
[01:51:06.638 --> 01:51:08.919]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:14.522]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:51:14.742 --> 01:51:16.583]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:51:16.823 --> 01:51:18.204]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:51:18.584 --> 01:51:20.845]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:51:21.105 --> 01:51:25.467]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:51:25.848 --> 01:51:29.209]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:31.691]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:51:32.651 --> 01:51:34.093]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:35.235]  One last time.
[01:51:35.595 --> 01:51:37.197]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:51:42.504 --> 01:51:43.666]  Coast to Coast.
[01:51:44.046 --> 01:51:45.388]  Direct from Austin.
[01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:49.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:51:49.934 --> 01:51:50.395]  Execute!
[01:52:03.422 --> 01:52:09.444]  It's world government, scientific dictatorship, run by vicious Luciferian control freaks.
[01:52:09.904 --> 01:52:16.245]  Even if you don't believe in God, the devil, and the seven seeds, you need to know the elite do believe in it.
[01:52:16.545 --> 01:52:23.067]  Pastor Lindsey Williams wrote a book 25 plus years ago about all the oil reserves in Alaska.
[01:52:23.167 --> 01:52:25.828]  It's confirmed he worked there with these people.
[01:52:25.868 --> 01:52:30.049]  He was a chaplain to these big board meetings between three big oil companies.
[01:52:30.089 --> 01:52:31.329]  He did get to know these people.
[01:52:32.688 --> 01:52:37.733]  Over a year and a half ago, he broke on this show that oil would go from 150 a barrel to below 50.
[01:52:37.913 --> 01:52:39.835]  It did that, he said, for one year.
[01:52:39.995 --> 01:52:42.997]  It did it for about 11 months before it went back above.
[01:52:43.117 --> 01:52:43.778]  So he was right.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:51.045]  Lindsey, you talked to this elitist, this former oil company CEO, who you're friends with.
[01:52:52.226 --> 01:52:56.429]  You first talked to him a couple years ago when he threatened you and said, the elite's going to take you out if you don't shut up.
[01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:59.112]  These old guys love to do that, love to threaten people, and they mean it.
[01:53:00.285 --> 01:53:02.346]  Believe me, you're exactly right.
[01:53:02.366 --> 01:53:03.167]  Whenever they say it, they mean it.
[01:53:03.187 --> 01:53:03.927]  You don't take it for granted.
[01:53:29.799 --> 01:53:32.141]  I have not done a single radio talk show for three months.
[01:53:33.021 --> 01:53:34.762]  No one has heard this material before.
[01:53:35.102 --> 01:53:45.288]  Only a few days ago, I hope you're hearing this, folks, only a few days ago, not two years ago, a few days ago, I dared to pick up the telephone and call this man.
[01:53:45.929 --> 01:53:50.792]  Alex, producer, said to me back about two months ago, he said, have you talked with this man yet?
[01:53:51.512 --> 01:53:56.375]  And he said, please, Alex, on the last show, I think you said, please give this man a call.
[01:53:56.415 --> 01:53:57.736]  I'd like to know what he says sometimes.
[01:53:57.836 --> 01:53:59.217]  I didn't want to know what he had to say.
[01:53:59.964 --> 01:54:04.025]  I'll admit to you, I was afraid to even know what this man had to say.
[01:54:04.385 --> 01:54:12.447]  When I got back here, after three months of not doing a single show, I said one morning, I just feel the urge to pick up the phone and call this man.
[01:54:12.507 --> 01:54:14.747]  I had not talked with him in nearly two years.
[01:54:15.247 --> 01:54:15.587]  I did.
[01:54:16.067 --> 01:54:16.988]  He answered the phone.
[01:54:17.388 --> 01:54:18.908]  He said, here are the points.
[01:54:19.368 --> 01:54:22.489]  We're going to deal with them in depth tomorrow, one after the other.
[01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:23.609]  Number one,
[01:54:24.577 --> 01:54:28.460]  Within two years, you will not recognize America.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:44.033]  Oh, folks, I wish to goodness somehow you could realize that unless you take action immediately, I mean, I don't know what you're going to do, but whatever it takes, immediately, all your children and grandchildren will forever be slaves to the elite.
[01:54:44.553 --> 01:54:47.976]  The second point, the elite have altered their timeline.
[01:54:48.036 --> 01:54:49.037]  Now, this is unusual.
[01:54:49.057 --> 01:54:50.398]  They don't oftentimes do this.
[01:54:50.891 --> 01:54:54.453]  And I'll tell you on the show tomorrow how they have altered that timeline.
[01:54:54.773 --> 01:54:57.535]  They've altered it somewhat in relation to inflation.
[01:54:58.035 --> 01:55:06.661]  They've altered it slightly concerning the time that they have set for the total, utter, complete annihilation and collapse of the American dollar.
[01:55:06.961 --> 01:55:10.463]  And I'll tell you why they have done that and go into that in depth on tomorrow.
[01:55:10.863 --> 01:55:13.565]  I didn't even touch today on Saudi Arabia and OPEC.
[01:55:14.105 --> 01:55:18.967]  And the Arabs and how it's affecting them because of what they're doing with oil right now.
[01:55:19.347 --> 01:55:23.688]  But oil's going back up to 70-something dollars a barrel, and I'll get into that tomorrow.
[01:55:23.728 --> 01:55:26.629]  Some of you I know are saying, well, you said it was going down to $50.
[01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:32.210]  Well, that's exactly what they told me for a certain period of time, and I'll tell you where it's going tomorrow.
[01:55:32.611 --> 01:55:36.412]  I know it's going up some, but it's going back down some, too.
[01:55:36.912 --> 01:55:37.172]  Next.
[01:55:37.828 --> 01:55:42.592]  He said inflation will escalate over a period of two years.
[01:55:42.952 --> 01:55:45.334]  This is one of the timeline alterations.
[01:55:45.895 --> 01:55:54.522]  I had said two years ago that it was probably going to have hyper, super inflation within a year to a year and a half.
[01:55:55.023 --> 01:55:58.966]  He says now because the American people gave the elite
[01:55:59.582 --> 01:56:05.485]  Approximately two and one half trillion dollars, Bloomberg's news service said.
[01:56:05.945 --> 01:56:07.706]  Oh my goodness, I hope you caught that.
[01:56:08.386 --> 01:56:28.975]  Two and one half trillion, I didn't say billion, trillion dollars, within the past, within the two months of the end of a Bush administration, you literally handed them on a silver platter approximately two and one half trillion dollars, and as a result, out of appreciation,
[01:56:29.477 --> 01:56:29.757]  I don't know.
[01:56:44.711 --> 01:56:55.120]  And out of appreciation, so to speak, they kind of altered that timeline, and the inflation is going to escalate over a period of two years with, oh my goodness, Katie bought the door at the end of two-year period.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.682]  You can't imagine what you're going to be facing.
[01:56:58.022 --> 01:56:59.163]  And they've already set the date.
[01:56:59.623 --> 01:57:04.187]  I mean, he used the expression over and over and over, two years, two years, two years.
[01:57:04.688 --> 01:57:07.050]  Okay, crude oil prices, we'll deal with that tomorrow.
[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:12.374]  He said again, gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[01:57:12.972 --> 01:57:18.054]  I'd like to go into tomorrow why gold and silver are the currency of the elite.
[01:57:19.355 --> 01:57:24.437]  Your and my currency, well not mine anymore if I help it, is a Federal Reserve note.
[01:57:24.778 --> 01:57:25.418]  It's a joke.
[01:57:26.038 --> 01:57:26.959]  Utterly a joke.
[01:57:27.259 --> 01:57:29.180]  Gold and silver never change prices.
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.122]  I know a few moments ago we talked about the fact that gold went up today and silver went up today.
[01:57:34.162 --> 01:57:34.662]  No it didn't.
[01:57:35.142 --> 01:57:36.023]  The dollar went down.
[01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:38.071]  Gold and silver stayed where it was.
[01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.852]  The purchasing power of that gold is still the same.
[01:57:41.152 --> 01:57:48.515]  I'll try to explain tomorrow how that gold and silver are the currency of the elite, and that's the reason you don't pay any sales tax on it when you buy it.
[01:57:48.935 --> 01:57:50.656]  That's the reason that they don't regulate it.
[01:57:51.156 --> 01:57:55.658]  And then I'm going to go into tomorrow who is going to be the le- oh, oh good, please.
[01:57:57.807 --> 01:57:59.829]  Alex, you're going to love this also.
[01:57:59.909 --> 01:58:08.678]  He gave me a schedule of events in chronological order of what you can expect and who would you think, and I'll answer it all tomorrow.
[01:58:08.719 --> 01:58:11.922]  Don't answer me now because it might not be right.
[01:58:12.426 --> 01:58:21.712]  Who will be the last group of people to be touched in the order, chronologically, of their total control factor?
[01:58:21.752 --> 01:58:24.994]  You are going to be amazed how this relates.
[01:58:25.294 --> 01:58:26.435]  Well, stop right there.
[01:58:26.515 --> 01:58:27.095]  Stop right there.
[01:58:27.135 --> 01:58:28.676]  Just give us a prelude.
[01:58:28.736 --> 01:58:30.937]  I know the DVD covers it all in detail.
[01:58:31.338 --> 01:58:32.558]  I mean, we'll cover it more tomorrow.
[01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:35.380]  But give me a few of the schedule of events.
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:36.241]  Give me the first part.
[01:58:40.689 --> 01:58:41.209]  Yeah, I do.
[01:58:41.529 --> 01:58:42.870]  The last group to be touched.
[01:58:43.630 --> 01:58:44.831]  It's going to surprise you.
[01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:52.775]  I know radio talk shows, all the talk show hosts are saying, oh my goodness, we're about to be taken off the air, all the rest.
[01:58:52.935 --> 01:58:56.456]  Would you believe the last group to be touched are going to be radio talk shows?
[01:58:57.617 --> 01:58:58.777]  Well, Hitler did that.
[01:58:58.837 --> 01:59:04.380]  He allowed some prominent Jews to stay in Germany and stay in the theater and stay on in movies.
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:08.202]  So they're planning to let us flap and scream and
[01:59:09.062 --> 01:59:16.272]  I've been told that, but it's almost like entertainment for them that we're like, the Great Dominator crushes America!
[01:59:16.312 --> 01:59:17.313]  They're like, yes, that's right.
[01:59:18.435 --> 01:59:20.397]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:59:21.338 --> 01:59:23.722]  Well, yeah, but there's another reason behind this, Alex.
[01:59:24.282 --> 01:59:26.085]  And the reason is, you see,
[01:59:27.031 --> 01:59:29.091]  They're, they control the major media.
[01:59:29.392 --> 01:59:34.293]  I mean, let's just, television, radio, I don't care what it is, major media, media, they control it.
[01:59:34.573 --> 01:59:39.494]  It's their greatest tool of telling the people what they want them to know and make them believe it.
[01:59:40.014 --> 01:59:54.337]  Now, if, if you, if they control the media and they want to use the media as their method of getting their message out, now, the moment that they limit the radio talk show, such as Alex Jones,
[01:59:55.151 --> 01:59:57.333]  So they're just going to control the media by being able to propagandize.
[01:59:57.353 --> 02:00:01.696]  They don't want a fairness doctrine because then that could be used in court to restrict them.
[02:00:17.642 --> 02:00:18.423]  That's exactly right.
[02:00:18.443 --> 02:00:21.046]  It would be to their disadvantage to cut off the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.066 --> 02:00:22.207]  So they're winning right now.
[02:00:22.287 --> 02:00:24.590]  Why should they change anything?
[02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:29.336]  I mean, I can sit here with government documents, how they're poisoning the water, and parents go, good!
[02:00:29.696 --> 02:00:31.198]  I want my kid to be retarded.
[02:00:31.418 --> 02:00:32.639]  I'm going to drink more fluoride.
[02:00:33.861 --> 02:00:46.332]  I mean, I guess that, you know, openly they're saying carbon taxes on everything, carbon taxes on flying planes, having a government certification to be able to get on a plane, that your travel is essential, and people are like, good!
[02:00:46.452 --> 02:00:48.174]  I love citizen spies!
[02:00:48.654 --> 02:00:50.016]  I love total government!
[02:00:50.576 --> 02:00:53.258]  I love a cross between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany!
[02:00:53.999 --> 02:00:55.601]  So, I mean, why should they care about us?
[02:00:56.601 --> 02:01:04.493]  Well, they think, Alex, that you and me and others like us, they think that we don't have enough power to be able to move the matches.
[02:01:04.513 --> 02:01:05.955]  They think they have it made right now.
[02:01:06.016 --> 02:01:11.404]  They are fully convinced that they have it in the pocket and there's nothing in the world that you and I can do about it.
[02:01:11.969 --> 02:01:22.798]  And they are worried about us one eye older because these little, these small meetings that we hold around the country and everything else, they say, oh my gracious, we have it so made already.
[02:01:22.818 --> 02:01:34.708]  Well, they're not worried because the general public only wants to put a sports jersey on and drink fluoridated water and loves losing their houses, loves losing everything, loves the left-right paradigm.
[02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:39.713]  And if they do wake up, they're just going to follow Glenn Beck, who's controlled opposition, right over a cliff.
[02:01:40.233 --> 02:01:42.774]  But I know in the end we're going to wake up and defeat them.
[02:01:43.234 --> 02:01:48.856]  It's kind of a mind game they play of being so incredibly arrogant.
[02:01:48.876 --> 02:01:50.897]  But, Lindsey, I interrupted you on that point.
[02:01:51.297 --> 02:01:53.778]  We're going to cover the chronological event tomorrow.
[02:01:54.159 --> 02:01:55.419]  We're going to cover some other things.
[02:01:55.519 --> 02:01:56.700]  But you have a few more points.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:58.780]  Give us those final preludes.
[02:02:00.061 --> 02:02:02.042]  Well, baseball, apple pie, and beer.
[02:02:02.562 --> 02:02:04.062]  And they keep you happy.
[02:02:04.623 --> 02:02:07.564]  And they don't really think that... Oh, he even said that!
[02:02:09.431 --> 02:02:09.992]  To rise up.
[02:02:10.272 --> 02:02:10.552]  Okay.
[02:02:11.033 --> 02:02:14.675]  We ought to get tomorrow into the subject of the Devil's Messiah.
[02:02:14.775 --> 02:02:16.196]  Oh, this is going to startle you.
[02:02:16.817 --> 02:02:23.342]  When I gave this the other day in the studio, the people said, we've never heard anything such as the elite have a god.
[02:02:24.042 --> 02:02:26.024]  The elite are not atheists.
[02:02:28.065 --> 02:02:33.049]  In order to understand this and what their moral code is, I'm going to go into their moral code.
[02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:34.890]  Their moral code is basically evolution.
[02:02:35.891 --> 02:02:37.933]  They have so persuasive... It's eugenics!
[02:02:39.139 --> 02:02:42.340]  Eugenics came out of evolution, it's social Darwinism.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:51.202]  When they torture and murder children, it's their divine right, do as thou wilt, because they are the dominant one, and so they're helping the earth.
[02:02:52.742 --> 02:02:58.743]  Well, they've rewritten the textbooks, and they have put in the religion of evolution, and believe you me, it is a religion.
[02:02:59.783 --> 02:03:02.724]  They did every bit of this, and they've done it over a period of years.
[02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:11.318]  As a result, they have persuaded people that they're nothing but evolutionized animals, and if they're nothing but evolutionized animals, then they have a right to act like it.
[02:03:12.179 --> 02:03:17.620]  And so we can kill the old people and euthanize everybody because we're all just blobs.
[02:03:18.201 --> 02:03:19.401]  Exactly.
[02:03:19.421 --> 02:03:21.382]  We gotta honor the earth, but not ourselves.
[02:03:21.662 --> 02:03:22.622]  Humans are trash.
[02:03:22.842 --> 02:03:23.962]  So he told you that, too.
[02:03:24.883 --> 02:03:26.263]  The elite worship something.
[02:03:26.783 --> 02:03:29.144]  But my question is, what do they worship?
[02:03:30.449 --> 02:03:33.210]  And there again, the name of the game is control.
[02:03:33.831 --> 02:03:36.952]  George Bush used to use the expression, God bless America.
[02:03:37.632 --> 02:03:38.933]  Okay, which God?
[02:03:40.193 --> 02:03:49.577]  That's the thing that the average American never stops, and the poor preacher in America today has been so fooled into believing that he was talking about the God of the Bible that they worship.
[02:03:50.098 --> 02:03:55.360]  My goodness, quite to the contrary, he was talking about a God, but please,
[02:03:56.045 --> 02:04:02.347]  Well, I think probably the most startling thing is going to be their schedule of events chronologically, and how they plan to keep the stock market going up and up and up.
[02:04:15.003 --> 02:04:20.746]  Other things are going to be drastically affected, and there's definitely a timeline involved in every bit of this.
[02:04:21.947 --> 02:04:23.848]  I don't know how to give any more.
[02:04:23.888 --> 02:04:25.809]  I mean, I've got so many pages of notes here.
[02:04:25.829 --> 02:04:27.730]  Well, randomly read some more to us.
[02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:29.811]  Giving us a prelude for tomorrow.
[02:04:30.751 --> 02:04:43.858]  Well, what I'll probably do tomorrow is start out with my very first set of notes here that I used the other day, and go through them one meticulously, one at a time, and explain the minute details in it, and then come down to
[02:04:44.799 --> 02:04:45.319]  Uh, money.
[02:04:45.979 --> 02:04:46.780]  Oh, my gracious.
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:53.382]  I'll get into the subject of money in depth tomorrow because the most sensitive part of anybody's anatomy is the rear pocket.
[02:04:53.862 --> 02:05:00.024]  And so I'm sure that you want to know what they had to say about money, where it's going, how they're going to do it, the timeline along that.
[02:05:00.404 --> 02:05:10.107]  Then I'll get into the third and the last of these, which is the devil's messiah, the churches, how they have affected them, how they've rewritten the textbooks in our schools.
[02:05:10.649 --> 02:05:18.534]  And basically how this man just literally poured himself out and said things that I am still sitting here stunned and amazed that anybody would ever dare to say.
[02:05:19.115 --> 02:05:25.559]  Well give us, in closing, a final look into when he talked about Devil Messiah, did he say our Messiah will soon be here?
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:27.861]  No, he did not say that.
[02:05:28.481 --> 02:05:36.606]  For all practical purposes they have accomplished about what they want to accomplish and whatever man may step on the scene to do what they want done, he did not say that.
[02:05:36.626 --> 02:05:38.588]  Well then what did he mean by Devil Messiah?
[02:05:38.628 --> 02:05:40.189]  He just meant we've taken over the churches?
[02:05:41.027 --> 02:05:47.769]  He basically meant, okay, here goes, and this is the buzz, this is the, what should I say, the prime line.
[02:05:49.389 --> 02:05:55.370]  They, in order to be able to bring America to the state that it is right now, they had to remove America's God.
[02:05:56.451 --> 02:05:57.751]  That's putting it in a nutshell.
[02:06:01.452 --> 02:06:02.592]  And they understood this.
[02:06:02.632 --> 02:06:08.794]  They had to make their new religion of eugenics the God, and they had to make the family be removed.
[02:06:09.034 --> 02:06:10.094]  Only the state can stand.
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:18.363]  Yeah, I think it was best expressed by Alexis Tocqueville, and I'll just read you just a few sentences here.
[02:06:18.403 --> 02:06:29.467]  When he wrote his book after coming to America, this famous French author, and he said, I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there.
[02:06:30.327 --> 02:06:33.249]  Her fertile fields and boundless prairies, and it was not there.
[02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:36.930]  In her rich mines and her vast world of commerce, and it was not there.
[02:06:37.754 --> 02:06:46.730]  Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with blackishness did I understand the secret of her genius and power.
[02:06:47.271 --> 02:06:49.475]  America is great because America is good.
[02:06:50.641 --> 02:06:55.045]  And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.
[02:06:55.486 --> 02:07:08.119]  They knew that they had to remove America's God in order for it to be destroyed, and one of the first places they started was the pastors and the pulpits, and the pastors can't say anything anymore.
[02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:15.316]  The hands are tied by 501c3, and Alexis de Tocqueville knew it.
[02:07:15.836 --> 02:07:16.336]  He said it.
[02:07:16.857 --> 02:07:17.798]  The elite knew it.
[02:07:17.878 --> 02:07:22.742]  Well, Pastor Williams, tomorrow, at 30 minutes into the show, you're with us for an hour and a half.
[02:07:22.882 --> 02:07:24.143]  Then we're going to set you up again.
[02:07:24.663 --> 02:07:26.345]  Keep an hour open Friday.
[02:07:26.365 --> 02:07:30.488]  In fact, as we end the show here, when it's over, I want to set up that Friday interview.
[02:07:30.508 --> 02:07:33.471]  We'll do Tuesday and Friday to get the full scope of this.
[02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:34.812]  We're good to go.
[02:07:55.086 --> 02:07:58.107]  Many other countries have more wealth, but they're slaves.
[02:07:58.728 --> 02:08:01.249]  It was the system of liberty that produced all this.
[02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:03.009]  Now we're going into bondage.
[02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:07.191]  And there's no doubt that that is the fact, and the system knew that.
[02:08:07.271 --> 02:08:08.271]  They want us dependent.
[02:08:08.592 --> 02:08:09.552]  They want us weak.
[02:08:10.854 --> 02:08:12.675]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, God bless you.
[02:08:12.695 --> 02:08:14.937]  We appreciate you coming on with us today.
[02:08:15.017 --> 02:08:16.318]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off.
[02:08:16.618 --> 02:08:19.340]  We're going into retransmission now at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:19.621 --> 02:08:20.721]  Great job with the crew.
[02:08:21.222 --> 02:08:24.244]  Great job to Nye Hartman, everybody else back there.
[02:08:24.264 --> 02:08:26.926]  I will see you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:08:26.986 --> 02:08:27.386]  Central.
[02:08:27.727 --> 02:08:29.328]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off.
[02:08:38.183 --> 02:08:42.290]  I think so.
