[00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:06.256]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.038]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:09.799]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.381]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:12.922]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:17.126]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:21.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:54.759]  We are going to have wide open phones for the full four hours today on the economy, the military adventures that are expanding, the door-to-door activities of the Obama Brigades, the fact that the House of Representatives last Friday passed a bill to set up a new federal agency to begin
[00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:03.778]  National Compulsory Service, including military service, known as conscription and the draft.
[00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:05.619]  Of course, people have been covering this for weeks.
[00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.620]  It is very close to passing.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.980]  H.R.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.961]  875.
[00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.402]  It's billed as the end of organic farming.
[00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:21.166]  No, it's not just the end of organic farming, because it tries to restrict people using cow manure and things, which is completely healthy.
[00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:25.448]  It's the human feces in Mexico being sprayed on crops that are causing hepatitis and things.
[00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:32.591]  It basically shuts down family farms, ranches, even a garden in your own backyard.
[00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:37.629]  So we'll be talking about that as well today.
[00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.270]  Also, we've got headlines like these.
[00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.591]  State apologizes to Paul Barr and Baldwin over Mayak report.
[00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:50.053]  The governor last Friday had issued a statement saying he fully stood behind the report.
[00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:56.315]  But then the Civil Liberties complaint has been filed against Governor Jay Nixon for abuse of state law enforcement.
[00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.796]  Temporary restraining orders sought against Nixon in U.S.
[00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:01.136]  District Court.
[00:02:01.136 --> 00:02:02.737]  And obviously, you want to tell the producer,
[00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:05.106]  Get these guys on.
[00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:08.147]  It's a pro-life group, a big pro-life group.
[00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:13.669]  And the American Civil Liberties Union is involved as well.
[00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.410]  So you have the American Civil Liberties Union filing reports on behalf of pro-life groups.
[00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.531]  So, a little gold star for the ACLU.
[00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.291]  They don't normally do that.
[00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:24.392]  So that is coming up later in the show.
[00:02:24.392 --> 00:02:26.733]  I'll cover that.
[00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:30.474]  Also, knock-a-door Obama army, a complete failure.
[00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.237]  You know, I wouldn't call it a complete failure.
[00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:39.620]  They got millions of the 13 million they asked to get out on the streets, to go out on the streets and knock on doors.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:50.485]  CNN ran a disgusting piece basically demonizing people that didn't fall down on their knees and pledged to worship Obama and to sign on to an expanded banker takeover.
[00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:55.428]  So we have that coming up as well in the first hour.
[00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:58.089]  Geithner plan will rob US taxpayers.
[00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.210]  That's what Joseph
[00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:11.076]  Sticklitz is saying, Nobel Prize winner for economics, he's also a Nobel Prize winner in another field, double Nobel Prize winner, and let's get Sticklitz back on the show.
[00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:14.878]  He's been on, I think, five times.
[00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:21.002]  So, that is just some of what's on our plate.
[00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:26.966]  There's a big headline today up on Drudge from the, what, the Times of London.
[00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.046]  In fact, I thought I printed that at my house, guys.
[00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:31.867]  I don't have that.
[00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:33.748]  There was a headline on drugs like two hours ago.
[00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:34.549]  I'm sure it's still there.
[00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:42.914]  It says, you know, China calls for dumping dollar, basically, was the headline.
[00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:46.537]  Something's going on with my printer at home.
[00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:47.858]  It's not printing everything I click on.
[00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:48.538]  I've got to get a new one.
[00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:49.979]  I've had the thing like five years.
[00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.840]  You get attached to it, though.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.423]  It's a piece of equipment, but I know the thing.
[00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:58.445]  My son was a year old when we got that printer.
[00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.792]  It's time to retire that piece of junk!
[00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:03.854]  All right.
[00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:04.474]  Oh, here it is.
[00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:05.935]  In fact, it was in my stack.
[00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:07.376]  I just hadn't stapled it.
[00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:13.501]  China calls for new reserve currency, and then within the article, they talk about dumping the dollar.
[00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:14.942]  So that's a big deal.
[00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:15.963]  Also, U.S.
[00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:20.726]  seeks expanded power to seize firms, not just banks.
[00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:24.189]  So, total takeover of the economy.
[00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.670]  And another headline here is, credit markets froze.
[00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.833]  Banks loaned millions to insiders.
[00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:39.215]  All that's coming up more, but on any of the subjects I mentioned or any items you want to go over, I'd like to hear your review of the Obama Deception.
[00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:41.256]  I haven't really taken a lot of calls since we released it.
[00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:42.637]  I've been busy with guests.
[00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:46.419]  I'd like to hear your review of the Obama Deception, what effect it's having on those that you show it to.
[00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.960]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.782]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us, and we're going to be taking your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:04:51.782 --> 00:04:52.082]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.158 --> 00:05:02.038]  You worry.
[00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:04.119]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.760]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.881]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:10.502]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:05:10.502 --> 00:05:14.083]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:19.325]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:23.307]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:24.988]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:05:24.988 --> 00:05:27.889]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.830]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:39.970]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.790]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.811]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:52.832]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:54.212]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:55.932]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:06:01.565 --> 00:06:07.596]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:12.926]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.974]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:21.955]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:24.417]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:35.304]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.267]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:41.128]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:41.128 --> 00:06:48.031]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:56.295]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.295 --> 00:06:57.876]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.878]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:05.640]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have
[00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:09.075]  We're good to go.
[00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:31.644]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.613 --> 00:08:07.277]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:23.167]  You know, near the end of the show yesterday,
[00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:51.552]  I saw a story out of the Associated Press where the Supreme Court today is hearing arguments to basically ban films that criticize the government under election law or any government official and they're calling this election laws.
[00:08:51.552 --> 00:08:56.236]  And not allowing people to run their films in movie theaters or on TV, not allow you to air it.
[00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:03.523]  So they're expanding the Fairness Doctrine out into anything and everything, basically, as they have called to do.
[00:09:03.523 --> 00:09:24.076]  We've got Jay Rockefeller, the Senator from West Virginia, saying we'd be better off if we never had an Internet, and Congressional testimony calling for restricting the Web, and, you know, because cyber-terrorists are about to attack at any minute, and there's 30 million attacks a day on the Internet.
[00:09:24.878 --> 00:09:36.171]  What that means is that there are Trojan boxes out there where people go out and put out viruses that program other computers to then do denial of service attacks.
[00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:44.441]  So yeah, in the denial of service attack on one computer system, you might have a million requests in a day or more.
[00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:51.900]  So that's how he puffs it up and says, there are 30 million attacks, this is deadly, this is going to destroy everything.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:57.244]  Meanwhile, they've handed over cyber security completely to NORTHCOM and the Pentagon.
[00:09:57.244 --> 00:10:05.890]  And the head of cyber security, two weeks ago, resigned saying the military is taking over the internet and basically wants to destroy freedom on the internet.
[00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.772]  And then the real inventor of the internet, not Al Gore, but the British
[00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.616]  Lord over there who invented it.
[00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:18.417]  I heard him on BBC the other day openly admitting they're basically shutting down the web as we know it right now.
[00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.698]  It's happening!
[00:10:21.698 --> 00:10:23.098]  It's happening right now.
[00:10:23.098 --> 00:10:32.240]  They are putting it into place just like they're moving to restrict and license and control small farms and small gardens.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.361]  Just like they passed a national draft Friday in the House of Representatives
[00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:46.562]  Excuse me, Thursday, and still no one seems to know about it, though we link directly to the bill that says compulsory national service.
[00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:49.724]  And this is a new expanded draft, not just, you know, 18 to 24.
[00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:57.207]  That's one group for the military and domestically with a new military as large as the current military we have.
[00:10:57.207 --> 00:11:01.568]  I mean, government is just exploding at every level.
[00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:07.271]  So they're creating all these new agencies, new draft agencies to carry out national conscription
[00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:14.154]  New agencies to take over and control the family farms and gardens.
[00:11:14.154 --> 00:11:15.375]  That's what this new bill does.
[00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:22.138]  I mean just new agencies are popping up everywhere and it's all about controlling the American people.
[00:11:22.138 --> 00:11:33.205]  It's all about sucking off of you and taxing you and squeezing you because they're spending around two trillion dollars a month.
[00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:33.805]  I mean that
[00:11:36.232 --> 00:11:40.794]  Makes Bush's tripling of the size of the government look tame.
[00:11:40.794 --> 00:11:47.197]  And the private banks are engorging themselves on all this capital and freezing the flow of assets.
[00:11:47.197 --> 00:11:51.759]  See, the banks had to be paid these trillions to not loan.
[00:11:51.759 --> 00:12:00.684]  That was their payoff so that they could have the capital replenished that they would lose from not loaning.
[00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:02.825]  And that's even come out in mainstream news.
[00:12:02.825 --> 00:12:04.726]  That they're hoarding all the cash, buying up
[00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:14.159]  Other companies, media, defense, construction, other banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms.
[00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:17.082]  And you notice, the more power and money they get, the worse things get.
[00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:28.551]  And the more frozen the credit market is, and I just saw numbers last week, where they've tightened down things even more than they were six months ago on lending for houses and cards and business loans and corporate loans.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:39.104]  And they say, okay, give us even more power, a new bank of the world you pay your taxes to, and then we'll turn the economy back on.
[00:12:39.104 --> 00:12:40.825]  So they're holding us hostage.
[00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:43.086]  It's really that simple.
[00:12:43.086 --> 00:12:46.307]  I mean, the public is mad about $165 million in bonuses to AIG.
[00:12:49.158 --> 00:13:10.006]  And then they find out that Obama actually wrote the executive order for the loopholes, for not just that bonus package, but hundreds and hundreds of others, actually in the thousands, several thousand bonus packages, you know, each several thousand packages that were to hundreds and thousands of people, depending on the package, so it's in the hundreds of thousands of bonuses total or more.
[00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:13.848]  But there are thousands of package bundles, to be specific.
[00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:22.870]  And then Dodds up there grandstanding, how dare them do this, I'm fighting against it for the last two months, and it turns out he wrote the provision of the bill.
[00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.711]  Of course they did!
[00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:29.492]  But that is a distraction within itself to the $9.7 trillion.
[00:13:29.492 --> 00:13:33.714]  And I know I keep saying this, but I think it was called Right Nation.
[00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:38.476]  I couldn't write notes.
[00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:43.918]  I was watching HBO this morning for an hour on the treadmill.
[00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:49.878]  And I saw a large part of this documentary.
[00:13:49.878 --> 00:13:54.019]  It said it was produced by Nancy Pelosi's daughter, because I recognize her name.
[00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:56.519]  She's made puff pieces for George Bush as well.
[00:13:56.519 --> 00:14:01.460]  She specializes in pure propaganda.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:13.303]  And they only showed people in Louisiana and Mississippi calling Obama the N-word during the campaign, saying he was a Muslim, a communist, that he was really Osama bin Laden, that he was going to pull a rubber mask off.
[00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:18.945]  Now, I can go find Democrat clowns just as crazy, just as insane.
[00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:21.387]  Kind of nut jobs that get attracted to political rallies.
[00:14:21.387 --> 00:14:22.948]  They're always there.
[00:14:22.948 --> 00:14:26.591]  And then we put some of those actually in Terror Storm.
[00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:32.796]  Saying that WMDs were really found in Iraq and one guy goes, nanny nanny boo boo, stick your head in doo doo.
[00:14:32.796 --> 00:14:36.439]  I mean, literally, these are mentally ill people.
[00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:40.282]  He literally put his thumb to his nose and went, nanny nanny boo boo.
[00:14:40.282 --> 00:14:42.663]  To me, in Terror Storm.
[00:14:42.663 --> 00:14:42.884]  So,
[00:14:44.397 --> 00:14:46.078]  Well, to be technical, Rob had the camera.
[00:14:46.078 --> 00:14:47.719]  Rob Jacobson.
[00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:57.466]  So we know those people are real, but the message is, you see, they're going to put out mindless, toothless, idiotic opposition to Obama.
[00:14:57.466 --> 00:15:03.571]  They're going to have Limbaugh thoroughly discredited, looking like he was drugged out of his mind again when he was up on stage.
[00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:30.664]  at the uh... conservative pact meeting and and and and this is come out in white house memos i told you this before obama was even elected and then when he was the era parent and when he was uh... president-elect i said you watch they're gonna set limbaugh up against him they're gonna set toothless ne'er-do-wells up against him, fake conservatives and then that will be what buoys support of the democrats
[00:15:31.687 --> 00:15:53.074]  Who are anti-war and anti-patriot act and anti-police state to go ahead and not just sign on the dotted line and go along with Obama's betrayal of all of his promises, but to fervently do it because they see him as the only option against Rush Limbaugh stumbling around on drugs and a bunch of people saying, I'm never going to vote for that.
[00:15:53.074 --> 00:15:56.334]  N-word.
[00:15:56.334 --> 00:15:57.695]  Over and over and over again.
[00:15:59.113 --> 00:16:01.935]  And Nancy Pelosi's daughter is out putting this out.
[00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:16.327]  Guys, go to IMDB for me, you know, the film site, and pull up, Google Nancy Pelosi's daughter films, and I think it's Right Nation is what it's called, but I recognized her name.
[00:16:16.327 --> 00:16:24.333]  I'm going to double check and make sure that's her, because there may be one with the same name as Nancy Pelosi's daughter who made this, but I saw most of it this morning, and
[00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:35.676]  That's why people go on the YouTube channel where we have the Obama deception posted for free.
[00:16:35.676 --> 00:16:41.480]  And they won't watch the film, they just say, you Republicans lost, get over it, you racist.
[00:16:43.953 --> 00:16:47.716]  Because then I, at the end of my workout, I flipped down a few channels on HBO.
[00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:53.239]  There was another film about the election showing racists not liking Obama.
[00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:57.362]  And I mean, this is a full court press everywhere.
[00:16:57.362 --> 00:17:12.092]  And so it doesn't matter if Jim Jones, James Jones, the head of the National Security Council, openly says on the CFR website that he takes orders from Henry Kissinger, who Nixon took orders from, and who through Brzezinski
[00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:23.669]  We had Carter taking orders from Bush Sr., Reagan, George W. Bush, the Vatican, the Queen of England.
[00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.409]  This is the Rothschild Legate.
[00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:29.331]  He's the front man.
[00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:36.233]  And so, it doesn't matter if he increases the troops in Afghanistan and now says he's going to keep the troops in Iraq.
[00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:40.954]  It doesn't matter if he says that the detainees don't have any rights and we're going to keep them in torture camps.
[00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:43.195]  It doesn't matter if all he appoints is lobbyists.
[00:17:44.488 --> 00:17:47.755]  They don't care because it's this mind game.
[00:17:49.793 --> 00:18:13.870]  This mental scam that's run, that's very simple, but works on the simple-minded, that they get him to rah-rah, get in a campaign, support Obama in the fight against McCain, then their egos are buoyed, they feel like they've won a big victory through Obama, he's now in, and then meanwhile, Limbaugh's stumbling around, acting like a drug gorilla, only way to describe him, looking completely psychopathic.
[00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.052]  Didn't used to look like that a decade ago, and the guy's just fried.
[00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:19.014]  I predict he's going to have a collapse soon, or something.
[00:18:21.397 --> 00:18:24.678]  He admits he took a hundred Oxycontins a day, folks.
[00:18:24.678 --> 00:18:26.759]  That would kill seven horses of average weight.
[00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:28.239]  I mean, that's how big his liver is.
[00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:31.361]  That's how much hillbilly heroin this boy takes.
[00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:40.984]  But, side issue, you see, Obama can't run, and he admits it's a perpetual campaign, his New World Order agenda, on what he's done and who he works for.
[00:18:40.984 --> 00:18:48.647]  He has to run on, he's this anti-establishment guy fighting the vast right-wing conspiracy of Mr. Oxycontin and a bunch of
[00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:54.099]  Poor ignorant hillbillies that follow him.
[00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.281]  That's what they're running on.
[00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:56.181]  That's who they are.
[00:18:56.181 --> 00:18:59.625]  That's what they're doing.
[00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:07.073]  But even that is wearing thin as approval ratings in most polls has dropped between 15 and 22 percent.
[00:19:07.073 --> 00:19:11.117]  But I was just amazed to see that film this morning.
[00:19:15.563 --> 00:19:31.512]  Meanwhile, Obama is launching the total banker takeover, complete seamless integration from Bush to him, the same people running the whole show, Geithner involved in writing the original banker takeover bill.
[00:19:31.512 --> 00:19:33.454]  That's mainstream news.
[00:19:33.454 --> 00:19:35.355]  I mean, that's what the public has to get.
[00:19:35.355 --> 00:19:36.836]  This is a show.
[00:19:36.836 --> 00:19:41.378]  This is theater, like Shakespeare, and you got Bush and Limbaugh and
[00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:53.546]  Obama running around they're all on the same team like Carville and Mary Madeline are married Or you got you know just all these families where they split up who covers what side of the spectrum?
[00:19:53.546 --> 00:20:05.853]  It's a fraud folks We're gonna come back and take your phone call stay with us Let's go to the heart of the matter
[00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:11.190]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:17.414]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[00:20:17.414 --> 00:20:20.076]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:23.038]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:26.721]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[00:20:26.721 --> 00:20:26.781]  Not.

[00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:03.752]  Peter Kravchenko here from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.752 --> 00:21:06.773]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[00:21:06.773 --> 00:21:09.254]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[00:21:09.254 --> 00:21:11.675]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[00:21:11.675 --> 00:21:14.156]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:17.017]  Scandal after scandal with hedge fund companies?
[00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:22.399]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:24.900]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:34.395]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:37.957]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:37.957 --> 00:21:40.739]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:40.739 --> 00:21:42.900]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:51.716 --> 00:22:06.829]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:13.836]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.392 --> 00:22:20.975]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.975 --> 00:22:22.955]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:25.456]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.456 --> 00:22:37.041]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:38.701]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:40.082]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:47.479]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.479 --> 00:22:55.748]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.748 --> 00:22:57.329]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.329 --> 00:22:58.511]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.987 --> 00:23:04.569]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[00:23:16.957 --> 00:23:17.437]  I think so.
[00:23:33.032 --> 00:23:33.412]  Let's do it!
[00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:26.696]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
[00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:36.917]  All right, let's go ahead and go straight to your phone calls.
[00:24:36.917 --> 00:24:38.838]  Don in Michigan and Jesse and others.
[00:24:38.838 --> 00:24:39.539]  Go ahead, Don.
[00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:41.501]  Hi, Alex Jones.
[00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:43.542]  It's a pleasure talking to you, my friend.
[00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:44.423]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[00:24:44.423 --> 00:24:48.166]  I just first want to say The Obama Deception was a great film.
[00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:50.849]  It wasn't as hard-hitting, but it definitely got the point across.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:25:07.810]  Well listen, the Obama deception is meant to reach out to people who aren't awake about the bankers being the real government and the New World Order, and that's why in the first five minutes we show that Bush is bad and so is Obama, and we show how they work for the same people.
[00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:14.875]  Now I've gotten emails from a few folks saying, well Alex, you talk about all this on your show, what's new here?
[00:25:14.875 --> 00:25:18.518]  It's made to wake up the masses that aren't awake.
[00:25:18.518 --> 00:25:18.858]  Go ahead.
[00:25:19.488 --> 00:25:19.888]  Right.
[00:25:19.888 --> 00:25:21.110]  I totally agree.
[00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.472]  But I just want to touch base.
[00:25:23.472 --> 00:25:24.913]  I'm actually from Texas.
[00:25:24.913 --> 00:25:26.555]  I live in Arlington area.
[00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:32.761]  And I frequently see a lot of Homeland Security and federal police trucks all over the place.
[00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:38.406]  I once knew a girl, her car started on fire and the first person there was a Homeland Security.
[00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:41.829]  And it just really seems like, you know, they're really getting us used to seeing all that.
[00:25:43.911 --> 00:26:05.284]  Well, I was talking to Jim Mars when he was in the studio Friday, and he talked about the 60s and 70s when he was the main crime reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in a car, and he drove around with a recorder, he drove around with a pad and paper, went to all the crime scenes, and the feds would show up with hat and hands saying, do you mind maybe if I could be involved in this investigation?
[00:26:05.284 --> 00:26:06.545]  I know it's not my jurisdiction.
[00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:16.769]  To even by the 70s when he quit doing that and went to be a professor and an author that they would just say, I'm the FBI, I'm taking over this operation.
[00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:20.010]  See, it's a total violation of the 10th Amendment.
[00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.771]  They're federalizing everything.
[00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:23.172]  I read a mainstream news article
[00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:31.803]  Yesterday, where Homeland Security is going to people's homes that buy a thousand rounds of ammunition to ask them if they're terrorists.
[00:26:31.803 --> 00:26:34.948]  What is Homeland Security doing involved in that?
[00:26:34.948 --> 00:26:36.910]  Well, they took over every federal agency.
[00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.254]  It is a federal police force.
[00:26:39.254 --> 00:26:40.235]  Everything is happening.
[00:26:40.235 --> 00:26:40.515]  Go ahead.
[00:26:41.223 --> 00:27:04.344]  Yeah, I believe they did that in Prohibition too, but my friend is in the military, he's in communications in the Army, and he's stationed in Fort Huachao in southern Arizona, and I was telling him about the whole border thing down there, and he didn't really believe me, and then I believe Rick Perry asked Obama for a bunch of troops, and a couple days went by, I talked to my friend again, he said they're shipping them to El Paso in full battle rattle.
[00:27:05.004 --> 00:27:07.987]  So I don't know what's going on with that, but, you know, it just kind of seems like...
[00:27:25.362 --> 00:27:30.426]  Yeah, my dad also works for GM to touch on a lot of that.
[00:27:30.426 --> 00:27:46.017]  Before GM even discussed about bankruptcy, they released these flyers around all the second shift people, and they were talking about how they're going to cut this and how they're going to cut that, and as soon as they said, or as soon as before they said they were going to get bankrupt, they took all these
[00:27:46.577 --> 00:27:46.797]  Yes.
[00:28:03.527 --> 00:28:04.908]  Yes, well, that was a month ago.
[00:28:04.908 --> 00:28:08.051]  It was actually in the news that GM was going to declare bankruptcy.
[00:28:08.051 --> 00:28:11.474]  And then two days later, they said, OK, we're not going to do it for now.
[00:28:11.474 --> 00:28:13.335]  So the flyer you saw was real.
[00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:14.336]  I appreciate your call.
[00:28:14.336 --> 00:28:16.378]  Good to hear from you, Don, in Michigan.
[00:28:16.378 --> 00:28:18.419]  Jesse in Las Vegas.
[00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:20.201]  You're on the air, Jesse.
[00:28:20.201 --> 00:28:21.302]  How are you, Alex?
[00:28:21.302 --> 00:28:22.563]  Good.
[00:28:22.563 --> 00:28:23.624]  Good, good.
[00:28:23.624 --> 00:28:27.227]  You know, I wanted to first start with the Obama deception.
[00:28:27.227 --> 00:28:30.029]  Definitely enjoyed it because I listened to you so much.
[00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:32.491]  I can't say that I learned too much, but the exciting part
[00:28:33.103 --> 00:28:36.164]  Well, I'm going to hold you over, but this is a key comment.
[00:28:36.164 --> 00:28:40.086]  I haven't really talked much about the film specifically since it came out.
[00:28:57.732 --> 00:29:00.333]  You know, other than the fact that we need to get it out to people.
[00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:21.117]  The film with their own quotes, their own documents, their own executive orders shows that they work for the very same group and it shatters the left-right paradigm and in the film we show how they put a loophole in for all of the major banks and brokerage firms to be able to give the bailout money to themselves as bonuses.
[00:29:21.997 --> 00:29:24.418]  Again, that just broke last week.
[00:29:24.418 --> 00:29:29.279]  Perfect timing when the film came out, because we just went to the executive order and read it.
[00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:34.401]  So, the film... I'm going to give folks a brief synopsis on air of what the film covers and why it's so important.
[00:29:34.401 --> 00:29:41.603]  We'll go right back to you, Jesse, then Kevin, Wilson, Justin, Jack, Robert, Kevin, and others.
[00:29:41.603 --> 00:29:42.223]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:42.223 --> 00:29:44.484]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:44.484 --> 00:29:46.805]  A ton of news coming up at First Your Call.
[00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:47.285]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.044 --> 00:29:54.966]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.966 --> 00:30:01.069]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.069 --> 00:30:04.571]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:09.093]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:17.298]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:30:17.298 --> 00:30:20.119]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:30:20.404 --> 00:30:28.032]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:30:28.032 --> 00:30:33.858]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:30:33.858 --> 00:30:39.704]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:42.948]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:30:43.248 --> 00:30:46.831]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:30:46.831 --> 00:30:51.895]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.

[00:30:54.818 --> 00:30:55.118]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:55.118 --> 00:30:58.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.563 --> 00:31:13.448]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.448 --> 00:31:19.954]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.954 --> 00:31:21.935]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.935 --> 00:31:24.378]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:35.207]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:39.230]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.091]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.091 --> 00:31:47.994]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:32:54.824 --> 00:32:56.084]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:15.197]  We are back live, thank you for joining us.
[00:33:15.197 --> 00:33:21.852]  Alright, let me try to explain why I made the Obama deception.
[00:33:23.683 --> 00:33:45.528]  Because I knew that all of the attacks from here on out, and the way the mainstream media is going to frame things, is that it's basically toothless, mindless, backwards, kind of mainline Republicans who believe that he's secretly Osama Bin Laden with a rubber mask on, that he was born in Kenya, and all of this.
[00:33:45.528 --> 00:33:51.529]  Whether the born in Kenya thing is true or not, the media early on chose to make that the big issue.
[00:33:53.502 --> 00:34:05.372]  Meanwhile, if you look at the polls, 98% of Americans, Congress reported 1,000 to 1 phone calls, that's more than 98%, against the banker takeover.
[00:34:05.372 --> 00:34:12.579]  Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Black, White, Chinese, Mexican, it doesn't matter, people know it's a scam.
[00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:17.103]  And they only know a little bit of the story, they only know a little bit of how bad the robbery and the fraud is.
[00:34:19.284 --> 00:34:37.291]  And so instead of attacking Obama on things that actually make him stronger, it only makes him stronger to have the discredited Bushites, that everybody know are a pack of criminal liars, lies about WMDs, torture, secret arrest, all the arrogance, all the secrecy, that is discredited.
[00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:43.403]  We did a lot of that discrediting here on air, but always pointing out that Bush was still a front man.
[00:34:43.403 --> 00:34:44.684]  They'd bring a new puppet in.
[00:34:44.684 --> 00:34:49.187]  And the film explains that they'll get rid of Obama in four to eight years and bring in a new puppet.
[00:34:50.071 --> 00:35:00.079]  And suddenly all these Republicans that were anti-establishment and anti-corruption, they'll suddenly love it because they will associate their personal power and their identity with the new Republican leader.
[00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:09.367]  Just like Democrats who were anti-war and anti-lobbyist and anti-banker, they're suddenly all for it because they see it as their man's doing it, they won.
[00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:15.912]  That's the emails I get by the hundreds in the comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet and the comments on the YouTube pages that have the film posted.
[00:35:17.619 --> 00:35:29.669]  You know, every ten comments, I'd say 90% is positive, but every tenth comment on average is like, you sick Republicans, you lost, get used to it, racist!
[00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:36.594]  They just don't understand, but a lot of them are actually watching and going, whoa, a bomb just went off in my head, whoa!
[00:35:36.594 --> 00:35:39.256]  Yeah, this is Alex Jones who exposed Bush.
[00:35:39.256 --> 00:35:42.759]  Man, Obama's betrayed us, we gotta go after the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:42.759 --> 00:35:45.041]  We gotta stop looking at the ponds and start looking at the
[00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:54.979]  The back line there, you know, the leaders of this thing on the chess set, the rooks and the knights and the king and the queen and the bishops.
[00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:56.620]  And so that's what the film does.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:05.709]  It shows you who really runs things, how they control both parties, how they're bankrupting the country and the world to bring in a world government of and by the banks.
[00:36:09.184 --> 00:36:31.704]  And so, as listeners of this show, and as patriots who are awake to the left-right paradigm and the new world order and world government, yes, the Obama deception slickly packages with all the clips and Obama saying one thing and then changing it later, saying one thing and doing another, and Obama working with the Republicans to bring in the banker takeover and how he was instrumental in getting it done and how
[00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:46.354]  What his real policies are of national youth corps, a new draft, restricting farms and ranches, animal ID, premises ID, lobbyist, it's all there.
[00:36:46.354 --> 00:36:53.779]  And so this is something where you can take all these complex issues and you can give them a 112 minute film
[00:36:56.107 --> 00:37:04.292]  Just shy of two hours, and it's well-produced, and they will watch it, and many of them, the majority of the Obamanoids will wake up.
[00:37:04.292 --> 00:37:19.962]  But, just as important, conservatives, because they're anti-Obama, but for the wrong reasons, in most cases, kind of the false, you know, right side of the paradigm, the limited conservatism, the controlled conservatism, they'll go ahead and watch it.
[00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:30.144]  And so what's happening is we're getting just as many mainline George Bush, Rush Limbaugh, John McCain Republicans are saying, oh my gosh, there is a world government.
[00:37:30.144 --> 00:37:37.606]  I checked all these mainstream news articles and video clips in the film, and they really are bankrupting things by design to bring in a world government.
[00:37:37.606 --> 00:37:40.207]  So it wakes up the phony right-wingers.
[00:37:40.207 --> 00:37:43.068]  It wakes up the phony left-wingers.
[00:37:43.068 --> 00:37:45.849]  And then they start investigating the new world order.
[00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:53.331]  The wake-up has begun and they're on the path towards moving for liberty.
[00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:57.173]  Not being, oh, I vote Republican or I vote Democrat and then both parties are controlled.
[00:37:57.173 --> 00:38:01.395]  Now it's a discussion of liberty versus tyranny.
[00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:08.594]  Now it's a discussion of, do I want freedom or do I want government control?
[00:38:08.594 --> 00:38:22.308]  And then the most important thing the film does is it shows that Obama has been billed, he has been cast, he has been pushed, he has been set up as an anti-establishment guy, and you watch his weekly address, video and radio address he does,
[00:38:23.669 --> 00:38:25.850]  Every Saturday it goes out at WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:26.771]  You can go watch it.
[00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:29.032]  He's always saying, I'm fighting the establishment.
[00:38:29.032 --> 00:38:32.313]  I'm fighting special interests and I need the American people to help me.
[00:38:32.313 --> 00:38:33.954]  I need you to get behind me.
[00:38:33.954 --> 00:38:37.996]  Because the establishment desperately needs boots on the ground.
[00:38:37.996 --> 00:38:45.259]  The establishment desperately needs their own private army to create the illusion that this is what the people want.
[00:38:45.259 --> 00:38:48.781]  And so as the American people protest and demonstrate and take to the streets,
[00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:57.123]  And take over the media coverage and begin exposing Obama, which is already happening, the true anti-war movement and others.
[00:38:57.123 --> 00:39:08.147]  They need to be able to sick their Obama supporters on them with the Obama zombies believing that they're fighting people that are stopping Obama's agenda of saving us.
[00:39:11.468 --> 00:39:22.673]  And I have a CNN clip we didn't get to yesterday, but after I take some calls I'm going to play it in the next hour, and they keep referring to it as Obama's army, Obama's ground troops, Obama's ground force.
[00:39:22.673 --> 00:39:24.273]  Now this has never before been done in U.S.
[00:39:24.273 --> 00:39:25.494]  politics, and that's true.
[00:39:25.494 --> 00:39:31.957]  It's been done in China, Russia, Germany, Cambodia, Cuba, Venezuela, and every other place that's under tyranny.
[00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:34.818]  It is textbook tyranny.
[00:39:34.818 --> 00:39:39.200]  Textbook classic communism or fascism.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.501]  Which again, in the false left-right paradigm are two ends of the spectrum.
[00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:43.682]  No, they're together.
[00:39:43.682 --> 00:39:49.644]  It's command and control always labeling itself different ways and then fooling people through that false choice.
[00:39:49.644 --> 00:39:51.605]  What form of command and control do you want?
[00:39:51.605 --> 00:39:59.168]  I don't know, they all wear black uniforms, they've all got secret police, they all go out to the Second Amendment, they all expand the size of government and hand the money to offshore banks.
[00:39:59.168 --> 00:40:00.189]  I don't want either one of them.
[00:40:01.718 --> 00:40:03.800]  Now, you can debate all day what Obama's setting up.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.821]  Is it hardcore socialism or fascism?
[00:40:05.821 --> 00:40:09.224]  And within the false left-right paradigm, it is fascism.
[00:40:09.224 --> 00:40:13.727]  I mean, if you want to judge it according to that yardstick, it is fascism.
[00:40:13.727 --> 00:40:16.389]  Newsweek has the headline, we're all socialists now.
[00:40:16.389 --> 00:40:18.430]  No, we're not!
[00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.392]  9.7 trillion to offshore banks of your money that you've got to pay?
[00:40:22.193 --> 00:40:28.338]  Meanwhile, they tell the dumbed-down masses of people that think socialism's good, oh, you're really socking it to the rich guys.
[00:40:28.338 --> 00:40:30.520]  You're getting some goodies right now.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.402]  No, you're not getting any goodies.
[00:40:32.402 --> 00:40:37.446]  You're being domesticated, institutionalized, enslaved.
[00:40:37.446 --> 00:40:46.593]  Out of the $9.7 trillion that's been served out, only $200 billion of it has been given to the people, and that with federalized strings attached.
[00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.093]  I'm going to go back to the caller because I was cutting him off as I always do because so many thoughts go through my mind.
[00:40:52.093 --> 00:40:55.837]  He's saying he talked to all these mainline conservatives and they've already heard of the Obama deception.
[00:40:55.837 --> 00:40:56.958]  See, that's the good news.
[00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:59.520]  This thing is going super viral.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.984]  There are hundreds and hundreds of versions of it on every major video service out there.
[00:41:04.725 --> 00:41:08.446]  And it'll be, you know, 500,000 views, 600,000 views, 900,000 views, 100,000 views, 50,000 views, 80,000 views, 20,000 views, 5,000 views, 170,000 views.
[00:41:08.446 --> 00:41:11.447]  I mean, it's in the tens of millions and this sucker's been out less than two weeks.
[00:41:11.447 --> 00:41:12.908]  So, please get it out to everybody.
[00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:35.350]  But also support this filmmaker or we won't be able to continue to make films.
[00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:41.193]  Go to InfoWars.com and purchase the high-quality DVD with the extras.
[00:41:41.193 --> 00:41:45.494]  We haven't put the extras out yet on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:45.494 --> 00:41:48.215]  By the way, I've got a lot of calls.
[00:41:48.215 --> 00:41:51.216]  We got several thousand orders for the film.
[00:41:51.216 --> 00:41:52.517]  We only have two people in shipping.
[00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.752]  It began shipping out the 16th.
[00:41:55.752 --> 00:41:58.634]  We are almost up to the current date.
[00:41:58.634 --> 00:42:01.236]  They have been slaving out there.
[00:42:01.236 --> 00:42:03.338]  So many of you have already gotten the Obama Deceptions.
[00:42:03.338 --> 00:42:05.459]  For others, it's shipped UPS ground.
[00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:07.921]  On average, it takes about three and a half, four days to get it.
[00:42:07.921 --> 00:42:08.822]  So you'll be getting it.
[00:42:08.822 --> 00:42:09.663]  It's been shipped out.
[00:42:09.663 --> 00:42:11.104]  Last week, they busted their butt.
[00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:15.067]  And as of yesterday, they are almost caught up to the current date.
[00:42:15.067 --> 00:42:18.830]  That means orders that come in today will be shipped in the next few days.
[00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.232]  And so I just want to say great job to my team back there.
[00:42:21.232 --> 00:42:25.136]  But go to Infowars.com, order the high quality DVD.
[00:42:25.136 --> 00:42:26.517]  You can get them as low as $8 a piece.
[00:42:26.517 --> 00:42:27.778]  Buy a bunch, sell them in your store.
[00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:28.239]  I don't care.
[00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:28.939]  Get them out to people.
[00:42:28.939 --> 00:42:29.580]  Give them to folks.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.241]  That's the way it should be seen.
[00:42:31.241 --> 00:42:35.663]  Make copies from it or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and download a DivX copy.
[00:42:35.663 --> 00:42:38.185]  It's probably four times better than the best YouTube copy we've seen.
[00:42:38.185 --> 00:42:39.245]  It changed the channel.
[00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:40.906]  The free one we're promoting because it's the best.
[00:42:40.906 --> 00:42:43.048]  It's gone from the fourth link to the second link.
[00:42:43.048 --> 00:42:45.169]  It's about to be the number one link on Google.
[00:42:45.169 --> 00:42:48.651]  That way when people Google it, they'll actually find the high quality instead of all the cruddy ones.
[00:42:50.552 --> 00:42:52.055]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:42:52.055 --> 00:42:53.578]  Burn them to DivX.
[00:42:53.578 --> 00:42:55.202]  You can burn them to regular disc.
[00:42:55.202 --> 00:42:56.244]  What, 20 cents a piece?
[00:42:56.244 --> 00:42:58.709]  They play in regular DVD players.
[00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.292]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[00:43:00.292 --> 00:43:01.194]  Get your membership.
[00:43:01.194 --> 00:43:01.915]  Get the, uh...
[00:43:05.373 --> 00:43:10.135]  Two hours a day, I simulcast the radio show, the four hours, Jason Berman's Nine to Midnight, that's all three hours.
[00:43:10.135 --> 00:43:13.596]  All my other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of other films.
[00:43:13.596 --> 00:43:16.257]  It's just five years running in April.
[00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:19.519]  We've had PrisonPlanet.tv, thousands and thousands of pieces of media.
[00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:26.281]  We're about to go to a Web 2.0 version of the site, which has been a huge hassle, just migrating thousands of pieces of media over, but that's almost done.
[00:43:26.281 --> 00:43:27.822]  All right, I'm done ranting about that.
[00:43:27.822 --> 00:43:30.483]  Now I'm going to try to shut up and let the callers talk.
[00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:31.323]  Who was I talking to?
[00:43:31.323 --> 00:43:32.564]  Jesse in Las Vegas.
[00:43:32.564 --> 00:43:33.524]  Okay, you got the floor.
[00:43:33.524 --> 00:43:35.005]  Tell me what's happening with the Obama deception.
[00:43:38.053 --> 00:43:41.314]  Well, first of all, the graphics on it, the sound, the production, amazing.
[00:43:41.314 --> 00:43:44.395]  Thank you very much for being such a professional and honing your craft.
[00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:50.897]  But the reason why I was calling today actually had more to do with martial law here in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:43:50.897 --> 00:43:58.899]  Just to start with a little hearsay, my wife was at one of the nice parks here in Henderson, and a mother was there, and it said, gee, my car was broken into into broad daylight.
[00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:03.700]  And the Henderson police had come out and said, yeah, this has happened a lot at this park.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:04.320]  And by the way,
[00:44:04.724 --> 00:44:07.765]  Crime so bad on the east side, they're looking at calling out the military.
[00:44:07.765 --> 00:44:10.426]  Of course, that set off my little alarm bells.
[00:44:10.426 --> 00:44:13.867]  I happen to have some relatives that work for the force, and I called them up.
[00:44:13.867 --> 00:44:19.109]  One happens to be directly over the east side on a graveyard, and I put it to him point-blank.
[00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:20.029]  What's going on?
[00:44:20.029 --> 00:44:21.670]  I mean, have you heard this?
[00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:28.872]  And, you know, he's kind of a normal guy, so I'm trying to, you know, walk lightly so that I can get more and more information.
[00:44:28.872 --> 00:44:30.453]  And he says, yeah, there's some bad mojo.
[00:44:30.453 --> 00:44:32.074]  Well, please explain what the bad mojo is.
[00:44:33.444 --> 00:44:39.887]  Well, you know, they're taking over coastal towns and border towns because, and I'm like, well, because of the drugs, right?
[00:44:39.887 --> 00:44:47.350]  No, no, it's more like these officers down there on the coast are wanting to side with the citizens instead of the government.
[00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.271]  I'm like, do you mean that these cops are corrupt?
[00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:51.871]  Are they in on the smuggling?
[00:44:51.871 --> 00:44:52.512]  No.
[00:44:52.512 --> 00:44:56.753]  They're going to listen to the local citizenry over what the federal government wants them to do.
[00:44:56.753 --> 00:45:03.116]  So the military has taken them over and now, you know, they're considering coming into Las Vegas because of some bad mojo.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.247]  I'm like, hold on a minute.
[00:45:05.247 --> 00:45:06.372]  This isn't about crime?
[00:45:07.748 --> 00:45:17.095]  And I mean, that's pretty much where we left it, but I mean, this goes right on the line with what's going on in New York, this goes right on the line with the other rumors that you're hearing, but why are our patrol officers being told this?
[00:45:17.095 --> 00:45:18.516]  Sir, that was not a rumor.
[00:45:18.516 --> 00:45:20.758]  Okay, let me tell you exactly what's going on.
[00:45:20.758 --> 00:45:22.919]  Well, obviously you know what's going on.
[00:45:22.919 --> 00:45:34.068]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51, the six months ago when Secretary of Defense Gates announced the restructuring of the National Guard under federal control,
[00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:56.088]  It states in that memorandum that they are preparing for physical conflict with the American people and the local legislatures to take over the states, and that even the Federal Congress, which is co-equal with the President and the Judicial, will be going under their control.
[00:45:56.088 --> 00:45:58.991]  So the Army War College, the Public Pentagon Directives,
[00:46:00.646 --> 00:46:10.735]  All of it is publicly drawing, publicly, this is not rumor, battle lines with the cities, with the counties, with the states.
[00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:15.880]  That's what Delta Force and the FBI and CIA have been doing for at least 15 years that I know of.
[00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:25.964]  He is identifying cities, counties, trying to get most sheriffs to be retired FBI or DEA or former special ops, getting their people in place.
[00:46:25.964 --> 00:46:29.384]  Taking America down isn't like taking down some third world country.
[00:46:29.384 --> 00:46:31.505]  The CIA can do that in a weekend.
[00:46:31.505 --> 00:46:36.406]  It's taken them decades, so this is the slow calculated takeover.
[00:46:36.406 --> 00:46:45.389]  Now, it's not a rumor that in that big town up in New York that we read the headline from,
[00:46:46.747 --> 00:46:48.108]  Schenectady.
[00:46:48.108 --> 00:46:49.308]  It is not our opinion.
[00:46:49.308 --> 00:46:53.550]  That was in the Albany TV news stations and the newspaper.
[00:46:53.550 --> 00:47:03.414]  We even had the mayor contact us and admit, his statement is up on PrisonPlanet.com, he contacted us Friday, and he said, yeah, well what's wrong with martial law?
[00:47:03.414 --> 00:47:09.017]  We need the army here to take care of five bad cops out of a hundred and sixty six on the force.
[00:47:09.017 --> 00:47:11.798]  See, and that's a mayor on the list
[00:47:12.578 --> 00:47:16.642]  of the first beta test of 45 mayors to go under federal control.
[00:47:16.642 --> 00:47:25.309]  So see, they've been setting up martial law, they've been setting up the takeover, they know the public's going to riot when they take the pension funds in the 401ks, even from the state workers.
[00:47:26.357 --> 00:47:35.083]  So, they need martial law to carry out the full banking heist like they did in Iceland or in Argentina.
[00:47:35.083 --> 00:47:39.627]  And the IMF World Bank documents came out in Argentina and they said they wanted to do it here next.
[00:47:39.627 --> 00:47:46.231]  That's why I've been screaming since 2002 when the BBC broke that and I had Greg Pallast on for even more.
[00:47:46.231 --> 00:47:47.492]  They're Newsnight reporters.
[00:47:48.633 --> 00:48:00.743]  This is, look, when I get up here and I say they're planning to go red, they're planning to go hot, when I read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it says for insurrection in the states.
[00:48:00.743 --> 00:48:02.165]  And so what's happening is,
[00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:14.666]  You know, I said four years ago with Celica Stillo on air, I said they're going to collapse Mexico by expanding the drug war against the cartels they don't control.
[00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:18.929]  They're going to use that to have martial law on the border states as the beta test
[00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:25.173]  They're going to have an economic collapse all over the country, and then it'll be precedent-setting.
[00:48:25.173 --> 00:48:26.934]  Oh, the Army's here to help at car wrecks.
[00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:28.955]  The Army's here to help at shootings.
[00:48:28.955 --> 00:48:31.917]  The Army's here to help at DWI checkpoints.
[00:48:31.917 --> 00:48:33.639]  The Army's here to help with the illegals.
[00:48:33.639 --> 00:48:39.863]  The, oh my gosh, there's so much, so many crimes and robberies, we've got to have gun control, which they've now announced.
[00:48:39.863 --> 00:48:45.206]  Oh my gosh, the Mexican Mafia's killing so many people and so many cops, we've got to restrict the Second Amendment.
[00:48:45.206 --> 00:48:49.069]  They have to bring in chaos, order out of chaos,
[00:48:49.709 --> 00:49:11.217]  To do this and yes through the fusion centers they have all sir I read last week a bunch of mainstream articles where they're putting Regular army and every major police department as liaison officers to to spy on the people They have the army spying on us at the in the Fed in Dallas Mainstream, you know news with mainstream documents.
[00:49:11.217 --> 00:49:12.337]  This is happening.
[00:49:12.337 --> 00:49:13.878]  So understand
[00:49:14.898 --> 00:49:16.399]  They have to sell martial law.
[00:49:16.399 --> 00:49:21.823]  They can't just one day when it's, you know, five years ago, a good economy, suddenly have troops all over the streets.
[00:49:21.823 --> 00:49:26.766]  They have to have a mega-massive terror attack is one way of doing it, but they use that to get in place.
[00:49:26.766 --> 00:49:28.027]  They'll probably have another one soon.
[00:49:28.027 --> 00:49:29.228]  I see that in the cards.
[00:49:29.228 --> 00:49:32.410]  They can't get away with this without one, without several big ones, by the way.
[00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:36.573]  So I'm saying that's going to happen soon, unless we get the word out.
[00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:44.438]  Without total economic collapse and maybe even, ace in the hole, a bird flu or SARS or something like that out of nowhere,
[00:49:45.459 --> 00:49:47.761]  So, I understand the enemy.
[00:49:47.761 --> 00:49:51.704]  And they want to do what they did in the Soviet Union and in Germany.
[00:49:51.704 --> 00:49:52.906]  The Globalists funded both of those.
[00:49:52.906 --> 00:49:54.287]  That's now declassified.
[00:49:54.287 --> 00:49:58.331]  They plan on a hot revolution where everything blows to hell.
[00:49:58.331 --> 00:50:04.036]  Look, all of the elites in the last four years, and a lot of them live in Austin.
[00:50:04.036 --> 00:50:06.718]  Austin's the richest city per capita in the country.
[00:50:06.718 --> 00:50:09.020]  More than Manhattan, more than San Francisco now.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.322]  They've all left.
[00:50:11.055 --> 00:50:11.495]  I do understand.
[00:50:11.495 --> 00:50:14.418]  And let me rephrase, I mean rumors in terms of these officers.
[00:50:14.418 --> 00:50:19.081]  In fact, I agree with you 100% Alex, and I'm very grateful because you actually
[00:50:38.044 --> 00:50:39.525]  Help me, and so did Ron Paul.
[00:50:39.525 --> 00:50:41.245]  You know, I ran for Congress down here.
[00:50:41.245 --> 00:50:51.390]  I know Stuart Rhodes, who you had on last week, Jim Dunsing, who was on with Burmess and Corey Rowe a few years ago for the Libertarian 9-11 conference.
[00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:56.712]  But what I'm saying is that these patrol officers on the ground are hearing this from somewhere.
[00:50:56.712 --> 00:50:56.952]  No, I know.
[00:50:56.952 --> 00:50:58.033]  They're getting ready to go.
[00:50:58.033 --> 00:50:58.373]  Stay there.
[00:50:58.373 --> 00:50:59.714]  We'll come back to you again in another Callers.
[00:50:59.714 --> 00:51:00.474]  This is just too important.
[00:51:01.468 --> 00:51:04.209]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:08.651]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[00:51:08.651 --> 00:51:12.973]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[00:51:12.973 --> 00:51:15.154]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[00:51:15.154 --> 00:51:19.936]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[00:51:19.936 --> 00:51:26.838]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[00:51:26.838 --> 00:51:28.039]  One Florida customer says,
[00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:37.116]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[00:51:37.116 --> 00:51:41.780]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.102]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.

[00:51:58.772 --> 00:52:06.858]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.858 --> 00:52:13.844]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.429 --> 00:52:21.012]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.012 --> 00:52:22.993]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:22.993 --> 00:52:25.494]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.494 --> 00:52:36.438]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.077 --> 00:52:38.738]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.738 --> 00:52:40.599]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.599 --> 00:52:47.503]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:55.767 --> 00:52:57.348]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.348 --> 00:53:00.470]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:03.071]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:53:03.692 --> 00:53:07.015]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:53:07.015 --> 00:53:10.798]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:53:10.798 --> 00:53:17.384]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:53:17.384 --> 00:53:22.608]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:53:22.608 --> 00:53:29.334]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[00:53:30.711 --> 00:53:34.675]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[00:54:10.366 --> 00:54:14.809]  The globalists are usurpers.
[00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:21.733]  They have overthrown hundreds of nations in the last century and scores in the last eight years, nine years alone in this century.
[00:54:21.733 --> 00:54:25.555]  In this new millennium.
[00:54:25.555 --> 00:54:26.575]  And they think we're chumps.
[00:54:26.575 --> 00:54:29.157]  A lot of people are awake, but a lot of people aren't.
[00:54:29.157 --> 00:54:30.598]  You look at Americans, they're soft.
[00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:32.130]  They're petty.
[00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.271]  They're full of themselves.
[00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:36.012]  They're tied up in the false left-right paradigm.
[00:54:36.012 --> 00:54:39.193]  They have no idea what's moving against them.
[00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:46.315]  Now, by record gun sales and ammo sales, some people are waking up and Homeland Security's visiting a lot of people that buy more than a thousand rounds of ammo.
[00:54:46.315 --> 00:54:48.336]  I mean, that's secret police.
[00:54:48.336 --> 00:54:53.338]  That's what tyranny is, is for no reason you start being visited by federal police.
[00:54:53.338 --> 00:54:54.058]  It's happening.
[00:54:54.058 --> 00:54:57.780]  Alright, let's go back briefly to Jesse and then I'll go to Wilson and everybody else.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.440]  So go ahead, Jesse.
[00:54:59.457 --> 00:55:09.641]  Ultimately, I appreciate the time, but I'm just saying, local patrol officers are getting this fed to them for a reason, but it's not in the reports, it's not in the forefront of any of the local people here.
[00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:12.422]  Yeah, they're getting them ready that they've got to go under military control!
[00:55:13.547 --> 00:55:32.410]  So, I know you guys are busy there, so I need my people in Las Vegas that are in the old Ron Paul meetup and the 9-11 truth meetups that we're all a part of to unify here and at least take it to the mayor, at least take it to the local police, at least get it to some reporter who may put it in the newspaper because it's happening here now, and this is a libertarian state, supposedly.
[00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:39.711]  Oh, it's in mainstream news that the feds are encouraging cities for any petty problems to bring in federal troops.
[00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:42.192]  See, they want it with a whimper, not a bang.
[00:55:42.992 --> 00:55:45.636]  You understand this is creeping death.
[00:55:45.636 --> 00:55:48.981]  They've got to get the police ready first before they tell the public.
[00:55:48.981 --> 00:55:53.167]  But all the government bills and documents state they're doing this.
[00:55:55.256 --> 00:55:57.117]  But see, here's the good news.
[00:55:57.117 --> 00:55:57.798]  Here's the good news.
[00:55:57.798 --> 00:56:01.280]  They need at least the illusion of public support.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:08.664]  That's why Obama is meant to be a messianic leader, to get all of these mindless idiots behind him, to try to sucker the public.
[00:56:08.664 --> 00:56:10.465]  But I'm telling you, it's not working.
[00:56:10.465 --> 00:56:15.228]  Now, in closing, you mentioned that you're telling everybody about the Obama deception, and they've already heard about it.
[00:56:15.228 --> 00:56:17.029]  So that's good news.
[00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.690]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:23.153]  Just even a little secretary at one of our remote offices that we go to, I, you know, just took a stab.
[00:56:23.153 --> 00:56:24.113]  Hey, do you like Obama?
[00:56:24.113 --> 00:56:24.874]  No, she says.
[00:56:25.501 --> 00:56:29.565]  I said, well, I was surprised, but I said, well, I have this great new movie called The Obama Deception.
[00:56:29.565 --> 00:56:30.166]  Oh, I've already heard it.
[00:56:30.166 --> 00:56:30.927]  I'm like, really?
[00:56:30.927 --> 00:56:41.577]  Yeah, all my Mitt Romney friends are really into that because they hate Obama so much, and they have this new film, and I haven't seen it yet, but... See, but hold on.
[00:56:41.577 --> 00:56:47.924]  We'll use their false right-wing hatred of him to actually inject the truth and wake them up and the liberals.
[00:56:47.924 --> 00:56:48.725]  See how that works?
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.522]  Absolutely, and I'm grateful for it.
[00:56:51.522 --> 00:56:52.202]  Hey, thank you, sir.
[00:56:52.202 --> 00:56:53.403]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:53.403 --> 00:56:55.084]  I hope folks will get involved there in Las Vegas.
[00:56:55.084 --> 00:56:58.007]  Yes, this is going on all over the country.
[00:56:58.007 --> 00:57:00.408]  Oh, the Marines are just here at a checkpoint to help.
[00:57:00.408 --> 00:57:02.290]  Oh, we may have martial law in the city.
[00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:03.551]  Isn't that nice?
[00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:04.652]  Oh, crime's up.
[00:57:04.652 --> 00:57:10.496]  Oh, they're building emergency FEMA centers with free medical care for the collapse of the tent cities.
[00:57:10.496 --> 00:57:11.837]  You can come live in a camp now.
[00:57:11.837 --> 00:57:16.261]  Then they advertise the camps, set the precedent that, you know, with the news getting tours of them.
[00:57:16.621 --> 00:57:17.822]  Well, we do have security.
[00:57:17.822 --> 00:57:21.803]  We do lock you in at night, just like the FEMA trailers in New Orleans and around there.
[00:57:21.803 --> 00:57:25.525]  You know, for your safety, you're not allowed to leave, but it's good.
[00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:28.827]  I mean, you know, we've had some rapes and robberies in the camp.
[00:57:28.827 --> 00:57:33.269]  Again, this is how they introduce this level of evil.
[00:57:33.269 --> 00:57:35.009]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wilson in New York.
[00:57:35.009 --> 00:57:37.130]  Wilson, you're on the air.
[00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:38.831]  Good evening, Alex Jones.
[00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:39.191]  Hello, sir.
[00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:42.173]  It's an honor always to talk to you and hear you.
[00:57:42.173 --> 00:57:44.934]  And I just want to thank you for making the Obama deception.
[00:57:45.663 --> 00:57:50.884]  Because it's just so interesting how you make something that might not be interesting to some people.
[00:57:50.884 --> 00:58:03.707]  You just make it so interesting and it makes it easy for me to watch and understand and to talk to other people about it and then broke down easily for me to explain to other people even more.
[00:58:03.707 --> 00:58:07.767]  Good, so you're having success with people under Obama's spell?
[00:58:07.767 --> 00:58:08.708]  Yes, definitely.
[00:58:08.708 --> 00:58:15.389]  I'm able to speak more fluently and easily to explain to them exactly why he's a fraud.
[00:58:16.388 --> 00:58:18.910]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you in 70 seconds.
[00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:24.353]  By the way, if you go to the obamadeception.net or obamadeception.net, either way will get you there.
[00:58:24.353 --> 00:58:27.896]  You click on the About button, it says About.
[00:58:27.896 --> 00:58:41.645]  The top link, that's all our documentation, the top link is a great bibliography, a viewer's guide, that a volunteer made, that we didn't have the time, it's every article and document in the film, right there.
[00:58:41.645 --> 00:58:43.326]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.434 --> 00:58:50.775]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.775 --> 00:58:51.415]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.415 --> 00:58:52.496]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:57.217]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.217 --> 00:59:00.178]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.178 --> 00:59:03.219]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.219 --> 00:59:07.940]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.300]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.542]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.542 --> 00:59:19.545]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.545 --> 00:59:22.806]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:22.806 --> 00:59:23.066]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:25.487 --> 00:59:27.948]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:27.948 --> 00:59:34.210]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:37.811]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:37.811 --> 00:59:39.351]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:39.971]  Take action today.
[00:59:39.971 --> 00:59:41.792]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:55.988]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.988 --> 01:00:05.374]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.374 --> 01:00:06.674]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.674 --> 01:00:08.455]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.455 --> 01:00:10.216]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.216 --> 01:00:11.777]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.777 --> 01:00:12.738]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.738 --> 01:00:17.521]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:21.603]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.939 --> 01:00:28.885]  A lot of what Obama is doing they're openly announcing, but quite a bit of it they're not.
[01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:34.812]  I mean, they passed last Thursday a national draft bill that is for women as well.
[01:00:34.812 --> 01:00:40.659]  The feds force middle school students to work for the federal government in basically brainwashing seminars.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:48.269]  High schoolers, 18 to 24, for military and domestic, a new domestic military conscription.
[01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:56.039]  Paul Watson's doing another big article on that that ties into the Pentagon's directive they put out three weeks ago for the new one million person civilian military force.
[01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:59.103]  It says in there, it'll be forced military service.
[01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:03.039]  It's just in a support role, not combat role.
[01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:06.442]  You'll still get blown to bits, or have a good chance of it.
[01:01:06.442 --> 01:01:10.465]  I mean, this is unbelievable, and no one is talking about it!
[01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:11.786]  Literally!
[01:01:11.786 --> 01:01:18.391]  You don't hear the ACLU, you don't hear the liberals, you don't hear the Huffington Post, because it's Obama now.
[01:01:18.391 --> 01:01:20.593]  Can you imagine if Bush tried this?
[01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:21.234]  Here's another example.
[01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:24.731]  Bush was spending on average $9 billion a year.
[01:01:24.731 --> 01:01:26.974]  One year it was $6 billion, then $9 billion, then $12 billion.
[01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:29.777]  It was around, you know, $9 billion.
[01:01:29.777 --> 01:01:36.845]  Obama's talking about $20 billion out of the stimulus package, and that's what it's written up for, just for ACORN alone.
[01:01:37.666 --> 01:01:41.148]  Another $20 billion to pay off the churches.
[01:01:41.148 --> 01:01:48.853]  He had a big meeting with thousands of preachers at the White House, and he was there enrolling them to quote, work in their community and basically spy on their neighbors.
[01:01:48.853 --> 01:01:50.874]  It said, watch your community.
[01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.175]  Run your neighborhood.
[01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.236]  Knock on doors.
[01:01:53.236 --> 01:01:55.917]  Now they're openly doing it.
[01:01:55.917 --> 01:01:58.259]  And it's faith-based initiative.
[01:01:58.259 --> 01:02:02.041]  I remember all those reporters, you know, Bush, how dare you separation of church and state.
[01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:04.763]  This is fascism when a government takes over religion.
[01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:05.403]  And it is.
[01:02:05.403 --> 01:02:06.103]  Or communism.
[01:02:06.103 --> 01:02:06.864]  It's command and control.
[01:02:08.595 --> 01:02:09.335]  Pick your poison.
[01:02:09.335 --> 01:02:10.636]  You can call it whatever you want.
[01:02:10.636 --> 01:02:12.256]  It's tyranny.
[01:02:12.256 --> 01:02:15.758]  And now they love the faith-based initiative.
[01:02:15.758 --> 01:02:20.119]  See, I mean, it's just Bush could have never gotten away with this.
[01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:22.300]  That's why they're making him a messianic leader.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.762]  Going back to Wilson in New York.
[01:02:25.762 --> 01:02:27.402]  Talking to Wilson, right?
[01:02:27.402 --> 01:02:32.524]  Wilson, to go ahead and finish up your point, you're saying the Obama deception is waking up Obama zombies.
[01:02:32.524 --> 01:02:33.125]  Yes, it is.
[01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:35.465]  It definitely took any doubt from them.
[01:02:35.465 --> 01:02:36.806]  Like, sometimes they'll say,
[01:02:37.389 --> 01:02:49.792]  Maybe, you know, he will do something good now that he has the power, but the film definitely just takes out, it just proves to them completely because it gives so much information and facts.
[01:02:49.792 --> 01:02:53.733]  So I just want to say thank you for just making all the information so interesting.
[01:02:53.733 --> 01:02:54.253]  Well, thank you.
[01:02:54.253 --> 01:02:58.854]  Describe in more detail the folks you've showed it to and what they're saying when they see it.
[01:02:58.854 --> 01:03:05.116]  Well, my mother is a teacher and I've showed it to my mother and then I gave her copies to give to teachers I have friends.
[01:03:05.805 --> 01:03:08.808]  And some of them are just, like, baffled at the information that it brings.
[01:03:08.808 --> 01:03:12.531]  Like, the Million Youth Brigade kind of thing.
[01:03:12.531 --> 01:03:20.538]  Like, that was hard for me to explain, but the film, it just puts it, like, so simple and so easy to understand.
[01:03:20.538 --> 01:03:23.800]  So that was just great.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.442]  And I just wanted to say one thing.
[01:03:25.442 --> 01:03:30.886]  If it's possible, you should try to make, like, a link that will make InfoWars, like, the homepage.
[01:03:30.886 --> 01:03:32.568]  So, like, right when you go on the internet,
[01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:44.872]  It's possible that, like, that's the first page that comes up, so I could possibly, like, do that in certain computers to make that the main page that comes up, right when, like, you go on the internet.
[01:03:44.872 --> 01:03:51.793]  Well, you know, we get so busy just trying to finish your film and get it out that we don't think all of this through.
[01:03:51.793 --> 01:03:59.534]  But I wanted everybody to put it all over the web, and then everybody rushed to upload it, so they uploaded really low-quality copies.
[01:03:59.534 --> 01:04:02.275]  A guy with the handle of Change the Channel
[01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:06.258]  That YouTube did the most beautiful, and it's in one piece.
[01:04:06.258 --> 01:04:09.038]  He's got a director's account.
[01:04:09.038 --> 01:04:13.099]  It was the most beautiful one-piece upload I've ever seen.
[01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.540]  Very high quality for YouTube.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.961]  And we're trying to link to that one.
[01:04:17.961 --> 01:04:23.822]  I would ask him to, you know, please put a link up there for folks to buy the DVD there in the description to the side because we need to make some of our money back.
[01:04:23.822 --> 01:04:24.742]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:04:24.742 --> 01:04:25.923]  We have no future anyways.
[01:04:25.923 --> 01:04:26.703]  We don't wake folks up.
[01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:38.286]  By exposing Obama, if we can shoot down his agenda, if we can show he's a corporate fraud and not an anti-establishment guy, this New World Order takeover is going to fail.
[01:04:38.286 --> 01:04:40.627]  Their attempt to bring in martial law will fail.
[01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:45.128]  It failed when the Bush's tried it as they had Nazi agents in 35 in the US.
[01:04:45.128 --> 01:04:46.849]  It failed when the Reagan people tried it in 84.
[01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:52.013]  They've been trying this over and over again.
[01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:54.596]  We're going to beat them again, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:56.138]  Good to hear from you, Wilson.
[01:04:56.138 --> 01:04:59.862]  Justin, Robert, Kevin, Groom, EJ, your calls are coming up.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.521]  Spring is here.
[01:05:02.521 --> 01:05:03.461]  Growing season.
[01:05:03.461 --> 01:05:05.662]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:05:05.662 --> 01:05:07.383]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:05:07.383 --> 01:05:08.363]  Think about it.
[01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:12.445]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:05:12.445 --> 01:05:16.187]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:05:16.187 --> 01:05:18.088]  The country is running out of food.
[01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:20.929]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:05:20.929 --> 01:05:27.832]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs,
[01:05:28.052 --> 01:05:28.332]  I'm good.
[01:05:46.932 --> 01:05:48.052]  And the best part?
[01:05:48.052 --> 01:05:50.393]  All orders ship within 24 hours.
[01:05:50.393 --> 01:05:53.253]  So head over to OrganicaSeed.com.

[01:05:57.814 --> 01:06:01.175]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:06.996]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:13.978]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.565 --> 01:06:21.148]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:23.128]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.128 --> 01:06:25.629]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.629 --> 01:06:37.214]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.214 --> 01:06:38.874]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:38.874 --> 01:06:40.235]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:40.743 --> 01:06:47.649]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.649 --> 01:06:55.916]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:55.916 --> 01:06:57.498]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.498 --> 01:06:58.679]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.814 --> 01:07:05.336]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:07:05.336 --> 01:07:10.417]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.938]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:11.938 --> 01:07:15.539]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:07:53.021 --> 01:08:05.808]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:08:05.808 --> 01:08:07.109]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:08.890]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:10.651]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:12.232]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.232 --> 01:08:14.153]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.153 --> 01:08:17.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.975 --> 01:08:22.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:33.151]  You know, I've got an analogy to describe how Barack Obama is conning everybody, especially black Americans.
[01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:39.090]  Well it's not an analogy or a parable, it's true stories.
[01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:42.330]  I scan around on XM radio and AM and FM radio.
[01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:53.833]  I'll listen like two or three minutes to BBC and then I'll flip to this, I'll flip to that and I might be in traffic for 45 minutes so I hear a wide spectrum of it and I listen to the left channel is what they call it.
[01:08:53.833 --> 01:09:00.494]  I think it's channel 144 on my XM in my car.
[01:09:00.494 --> 01:09:04.555]  And they had the talk show host, he's got a Saturday night show on
[01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.027]  I forget his name on CNN now.
[01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:10.988]  He's a black guy.
[01:09:10.988 --> 01:09:17.191]  And he had a mortgage expert on talking about the scams that are running.
[01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:19.513]  And he had black caller after black caller.
[01:09:19.513 --> 01:09:20.893]  So I ended up listening more than three minutes.
[01:09:20.893 --> 01:09:23.275]  I listened all the way home last night.
[01:09:23.275 --> 01:09:30.839]  Talking about how they had nice, friendly black people call them up to refinance their mortgages in 2001, 2002.
[01:09:30.839 --> 01:09:32.960]  These people have good jobs paying their mortgages.
[01:09:37.065 --> 01:09:42.496]  And they would use, you know, a pro-empowerment black agenda, and they were listing the companies on air.
[01:09:42.496 --> 01:09:45.361]  The guest he had on was aware of it all and confirming it, and he was reading articles.
[01:09:48.999 --> 01:09:55.201]  And they were describing how then they would go down to the brokerage place to then refinance, and it would be black people.
[01:09:55.201 --> 01:10:06.986]  But of course it's a big, globalist, predominantly white-owned company, and how they would then rip them off and cheat them on the mortgage and actually make it a lot worse financial deal than they previously had.
[01:10:06.986 --> 01:10:11.067]  And then how they went to court and beat them, but still, you know, they won't change the mortgage.
[01:10:11.067 --> 01:10:13.128]  I mean, that's all it is, folks.
[01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:24.099]  White slave traders going into the Gold Coast of Africa in the transatlantic slave trade, they had blacks delivering them the slaves that would go inland and capture black tribes.
[01:10:24.099 --> 01:10:29.725]  I mean, it's so elementary that the New World Order will put a black face on itself.
[01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.467]  Their agenda was imploding.
[01:10:31.467 --> 01:10:33.309]  Their agenda was falling apart.
[01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:47.339]  The country was on the edge of real revolution, as KRS-One says in the Obama Deception, and they put a black face on the New World Order by just sat back and said, okay, I'm standing down.
[01:10:47.339 --> 01:10:48.900]  And it's that simple.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:54.124]  And I'm not saying that white people are innately evil, I'm just speaking about what empires do.
[01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:57.467]  When white people were enslaving white people, when Julius Caesar
[01:10:58.973 --> 01:11:06.220]  For two decades was taking over Gaul, which is France today, and Germania, which is Germany and Austria and other areas.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:17.510]  He would go in and he would use one Germanic chief to go after the next Germanic chief, or he'd get one Germanic chief to con his group to going into slavery by paying him off.
[01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:22.575]  So that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen, and it's that simple.
[01:11:23.866 --> 01:11:30.741]  Obama has lied about everything and is betraying you because he's a front man who was financed by the big banks.
[01:11:30.741 --> 01:11:32.304]  What did you think he was going to do?
[01:11:34.298 --> 01:11:39.181]  Now, look, I said I want to take a bunch of calls today, but every caller has been such important information.
[01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:41.023]  I was spending about five minutes with each caller.
[01:11:41.023 --> 01:11:47.787]  I promise, in the next seven, we're going to go to Justin, Robert, Roomie, EJ, Jay, and a bunch of folks, but so I get to everybody, you each get one minute.
[01:11:47.787 --> 01:11:55.453]  I'm just going to sit here, shut up, and let you make your point, and I'm going to the next person, because I want to take a lot of calls today, and I'm really mad at myself that I can hardly ever make myself do this.
[01:11:55.453 --> 01:11:57.254]  I want to try today to take a lot of calls.
[01:11:59.369 --> 01:12:18.840]  I got a bunch of news coming up too, but for the next 10 minutes or so, I wanted to bring up Tyler Palmer, who comes on with us once a month, because preparedness is very important and a lot of listeners have gotten these and been very excited by them, but other people email me and call me and say, I don't understand how this works.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.561]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:32.926]  In 30,000 feet, in the first 30,000 feet of the atmosphere, on average, if they condense all the water down that's in it, on an average humidity day, there's over 30 feet of water.
[01:12:32.926 --> 01:12:40.430]  There's also about an inch, in the first 50,000 feet of the atmosphere, of rock.
[01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:42.411]  That's right!
[01:12:42.411 --> 01:12:51.276]  Rock, and dust, and pieces of wood, and pieces of dead insects, and coal, and potash, and everything else, from volcanoes.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:13:03.388]  If you condense the first 50,000 feet of the atmosphere down to the ground, you would have at least an inch of dirt in your hand.
[01:13:03.388 --> 01:13:06.591]  And it would be an inch of dirt that would cover, you know, everything.
[01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:10.014]  For every square inch, you'd have an inch of dirt.
[01:13:10.014 --> 01:13:15.098]  Well, you also have 30 plus feet of water.
[01:13:15.098 --> 01:13:16.219]  That's what clouds are.
[01:13:17.506 --> 01:13:20.949]  Now, by the way, that's what blocks out most of the solar radiation.
[01:13:20.949 --> 01:13:29.755]  You hear about the astronauts, there's a solar flare, have to run, get inside a compartment in the space station, inside the water tanks, because the water is a shield.
[01:13:29.755 --> 01:13:31.216]  Well, that's just a few feet of it.
[01:13:31.216 --> 01:13:39.282]  That's why you hear about airline pilots above 30,000 feet get the equivalent of thousands of chest x-rays in their, you know, decades of flying.
[01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.764]  But I'm going off into a side issue, and I apologize for that.
[01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:51.653]  But this is the radiation shield of the earth, is the water and the dirt in the atmosphere.
[01:13:51.653 --> 01:13:57.394]  Now, these machines grab water out of the air, it sends it through seven filters and gives you the best water.
[01:13:57.394 --> 01:14:03.696]  You can pull stuff out of a well, pull stuff out of the tap, you can put it through filters, it'll cut out a lot of stuff, but not everything.
[01:14:03.696 --> 01:14:06.737]  The only way to cut it all out is the Ecolablue system.
[01:14:06.737 --> 01:14:12.279]  Tyler Palmer, the inventor and chief officer there at Ecolablue.com, thanks for coming on, sir.
[01:14:13.069 --> 01:14:13.910]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:14.730]  Good to be on again.
[01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:30.961]  And, uh, that was an interesting fact about the first, uh, 30,000, uh, feet of the atmosphere condensing into 30 feet of water, uh, and having a visual image of a flood of biblical proportion.
[01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:31.822]  Well, that's what it is.
[01:14:31.822 --> 01:14:33.543]  That's why we don't die from the radiation.
[01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:35.104]  That's right.
[01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:40.247]  And a lot of scientists believe, uh, life evolved, uh, in the ocean because that's where, uh,
[01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:45.595]  It was protected from the UV radiation.
[01:14:45.595 --> 01:14:49.617]  Because before we had the thick atmosphere, it would burn anything on the land.
[01:14:49.617 --> 01:14:51.738]  That's correct.
[01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:57.561]  Absolutely, and carbon dioxide is a big part of that shield, which they've now listed as a deadly chemical weapon, basically, they have to tax.
[01:14:57.561 --> 01:15:03.944]  Tell us about the Ecolablue, because folks need to take advantage of this, and when you do come on once a month, you always offer a huge discount.
[01:15:03.944 --> 01:15:04.164]  Right.
[01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:12.383]  Introducing a new, uh, it's not a new Ecolo Blue unit, but it does have one new feature.
[01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:19.946]  Um, the lower storage tank is now lined with stainless steel and includes an extra UV light.
[01:15:19.946 --> 01:15:32.550]  And, uh, if you order, uh, within the next week, uh, we're going to throw in a two year supply of filters for free to any listener who mentions the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:33.851]  But the, uh,
[01:15:34.641 --> 01:15:39.262]  The catch is, you have to call our 800 number to do that.
[01:15:39.262 --> 01:15:40.902]  You can't do it over the website.
[01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:44.063]  Yeah, because you guys would have to change all the prices for everybody.
[01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:47.243]  Give folks the toll-free number.
[01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:47.524]  That's 800-691-6043.
[01:15:47.524 --> 01:15:48.024]  And again, 800-691-6043.
[01:15:48.024 --> 01:15:50.744]  And if you're calling from outside of the country,
[01:16:01.129 --> 01:16:03.353]  Canada, Europe, it's 925-231-0206.
[01:16:08.336 --> 01:16:14.998]  We're going to have those numbers out in a minute, but you know, something I want you guys to plug, you have huge industrial units, you have middle-sized units.
[01:16:14.998 --> 01:16:22.281]  I mean, the one you sell here and promote is the 7.5 gallon a day little unit that looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[01:16:22.281 --> 01:16:22.741]  Right.
[01:16:22.741 --> 01:16:31.904]  But I really think you guys ought to promote the big units because there's a lot of ranchers, a lot of restaurants, a lot of people that I think should get your big units.
[01:16:31.904 --> 01:16:37.986]  Yeah, and we certainly are moving into that range of promotion.
[01:16:39.018 --> 01:16:45.739]  A lot of customers call up and they want to be completely off-grid with their water.
[01:16:45.739 --> 01:17:04.863]  You know, you can live a few days without drinking water, and so people want to be prepared, and on average we're used to using 80 to 100 gallons of water a day, compared to in the Middle Ages when people got by on about five gallons a day.
[01:17:05.694 --> 01:17:17.583]  So, the Ecolaboo 28 is really for supplementing your water, not drinking fluoride-contaminated water at home, having control over your water.
[01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:33.375]  But if you want to be off-grid, showering in clean water and, you know, washing, cooking, all that in clean water, we do have a unit, a range of industrial units ranging from 200 to up to 5,000 liters per day.
[01:17:36.517 --> 01:17:47.707]  Um, and that's a, uh, 5,000 liters is about, let's see, it's about 1,315 gallons of water a day.
[01:17:47.707 --> 01:18:01.680]  Now, uh, not to be misleading, that thing's about the size of a school bus, but we do have something, the 200 liter per day, which is the 70 gallon, uh, that translates to 70 gallons a day.
[01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:11.642]  And the 500, they're very, they're about the size of, I don't know, a small car maybe, a really small car.
[01:18:11.642 --> 01:18:13.643]  And a lot of governments and militaries buy these.
[01:18:13.643 --> 01:18:22.727]  For those that want to get the regular Ecola Blue with a replacement of filters for a year from now, you get that free.
[01:18:22.727 --> 01:18:24.868]  Isn't that a couple hundred dollar value?
[01:18:24.868 --> 01:18:29.510]  It's about a hundred and eighty dollar value and a lot of people who order the machine
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:42.068]  They want to make sure that they've got extra filters on hand in the event that, you know, some sort of tragedy or flood of biblical proportions or whatever happens.
[01:18:42.068 --> 01:18:42.448]  Sure.
[01:18:42.448 --> 01:18:46.431]  And you need, you know, customer service centers aren't going to be there.
[01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:47.912]  Well, let's do this.
[01:18:47.912 --> 01:18:53.115]  Let's give out the international line and the toll-free line one more time, twice.
[01:18:53.115 --> 01:18:53.916]  Okay.
[01:18:53.916 --> 01:18:55.737]  International line is area code 925-231-0206.
[01:19:00.555 --> 01:19:02.516]  Again, 925-231-0206.
[01:19:02.516 --> 01:19:10.598]  The toll-free number, 1-800-691-6043.
[01:19:10.598 --> 01:19:13.899]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:19:13.899 --> 01:19:22.662]  And they can find those numbers at acolablue.com or on the big banners that link through at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:24.722]  How long will this special last?
[01:19:24.722 --> 01:19:28.444]  Uh, we're going to do it until the 1st of April.
[01:19:28.444 --> 01:19:29.424]  So, about a week.
[01:19:30.006 --> 01:19:31.507]  All right, a week, folks.
[01:19:31.507 --> 01:19:33.649]  This is a great unit, great price.
[01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:35.731]  That's $180 off the normal price.
[01:19:35.731 --> 01:19:37.632]  That's more than a tenth off.
[01:19:37.632 --> 01:19:38.913]  You can't beat that deal.
[01:19:38.913 --> 01:19:41.215]  Give them the toll-free number one more time.
[01:19:41.215 --> 01:19:45.138]  It's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:19:45.138 --> 01:19:47.760]  Tyler, you've done an amazing job with this system.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.821]  It's the best unit out there.
[01:19:48.821 --> 01:19:49.702]  That's why we carry it.
[01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:50.763]  That's why we promote it.
[01:19:50.763 --> 01:19:52.384]  Tyler Palmer from acolablue.com.
[01:19:52.384 --> 01:19:53.445]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:19:53.445 --> 01:19:56.447]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you to the listeners.
[01:19:56.447 --> 01:19:56.808]  You bet.
[01:19:56.808 --> 01:19:57.368]  God bless you.
[01:19:57.368 --> 01:19:58.469]  We'll be right back with your call.
[01:19:58.469 --> 01:19:59.550]  Stay with me in a ton of news.
[01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:09.256]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:20:09.256 --> 01:20:13.819]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:20:13.819 --> 01:20:18.502]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:20:18.502 --> 01:20:19.903]  It's a documented fact.
[01:20:19.923 --> 01:20:20.343]  We're good to go!
[01:20:38.843 --> 01:20:43.907]  Once a day, FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:20:43.907 --> 01:20:47.049]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:20:47.049 --> 01:20:50.791]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:54.293]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:20:54.293 --> 01:20:54.674]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:20:54.674 --> 01:20:58.656]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.703 --> 01:21:13.587]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.587 --> 01:21:20.072]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:20.072 --> 01:21:22.053]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:22.053 --> 01:21:24.515]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:24.515 --> 01:21:35.403]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.691 --> 01:21:39.372]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:41.213]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:41.213 --> 01:21:48.135]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:57.959 --> 01:21:59.160]  The people strike back.

[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.502]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[01:23:07.502 --> 01:23:10.523]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[01:23:10.523 --> 01:23:16.745]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[01:23:16.745 --> 01:23:20.406]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[01:23:20.406 --> 01:23:21.686]  We have been warned.
[01:23:21.686 --> 01:23:27.828]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[01:23:28.678 --> 01:23:31.903]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[01:23:31.903 --> 01:23:32.324]  Why?
[01:23:32.324 --> 01:23:36.109]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[01:23:37.873 --> 01:23:44.378]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[01:23:53.664 --> 01:23:54.285]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[01:24:13.943 --> 01:24:16.404]  They come from the land of the ice and snow.
[01:24:16.404 --> 01:24:28.526]  All right, I said we're going to have open phones today, but I had to set this guest up.
[01:24:28.526 --> 01:24:33.147]  Coming up in about 40 minutes, Ed Martin, spokesman for Missourians United for Life.
[01:24:33.147 --> 01:24:35.648]  They've basically filed a complaint and
[01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:38.331]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today, buddy?
[01:25:02.509 --> 01:25:04.210]  Hey, I was wanting to ask you something.
[01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:05.551]  I saw The Obama Deception.
[01:25:05.551 --> 01:25:07.072]  I've actually watched it about three times.
[01:25:07.072 --> 01:25:08.492]  I think it's a great film.
[01:25:08.492 --> 01:25:09.833]  I think he did a really good job.
[01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:12.154]  It doesn't demonize his character.
[01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:15.676]  Personally, it just tackles the whole issue of the New World Order.
[01:25:15.676 --> 01:25:25.942]  One of the things I wanted to ask you about, though, I noticed when you were going over his staff and everything, you didn't mention in the film that most of them have dual citizenships with Israel.
[01:25:25.942 --> 01:25:28.063]  Was there a reason that you decided to skip that?
[01:25:28.579 --> 01:25:30.620]  Or was that just a conscious decision on your part?
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.462]  Or you didn't think it was relevant?
[01:25:32.462 --> 01:25:33.222]  Talk to me about that.
[01:25:33.222 --> 01:25:33.783]  What do you think?
[01:25:58.739 --> 01:26:05.688]  The more esoteric stuff like his relationship to Cheney and to Bush, how he's cousins to him and then how Bush was cousins to
[01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:08.836]  Kerry.
[01:26:08.836 --> 01:26:18.721]  I meant to get into how most of his cabinet has to step down before they ever even get approved by the Senate, because they're such mafia thugs.
[01:26:18.721 --> 01:26:25.345]  I meant to get into how Moore Valley wants to encircle Russia, how they are planning on destabilizing things.
[01:26:25.345 --> 01:26:28.727]  I meant to get more into the faith-based initiative.
[01:26:28.727 --> 01:26:32.188]  And we've got a big announcement coming up next week.
[01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:34.730]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:36.271]  I've got a big announcement coming up next week.
[01:26:38.743 --> 01:26:40.669]  Oh, you know what?
[01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:42.455]  I'll just go ahead and make the announcement now.
[01:26:42.455 --> 01:26:43.860]  Why wait?
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.321]  Why do it?
[01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:50.054]  July 4th, I'm coming out with a second Obama film, okay?
[01:26:50.054 --> 01:27:06.830]  With all the material that hit the cutting room floor and all the new stuff he's done, like the draft being passed the House, like the bailout to openly announcing world government, the Israeli connection, all the crooks in his administration, all of that.
[01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:10.633]  But this first film, the Obama deception,
[01:27:11.656 --> 01:27:16.878]  This first film was just meant to explain, hey, let's stop being children.
[01:27:16.878 --> 01:27:23.741]  Both Bush and Obama and McCain, they all offer the same policies, different rhetoric.
[01:27:24.953 --> 01:27:31.095]  And it was meant to show that the bankers are collapsing the society to bring in martial law.
[01:27:31.095 --> 01:27:41.838]  That's the main message, is the bankers are our enemy and they're above the law criminals, and they're openly announcing that they're above the law, and Kissinger's saying Obama's going to bring in the New World Order.
[01:27:41.838 --> 01:27:46.339]  That's, this film is for the uninitiated.
[01:27:46.339 --> 01:27:49.180]  This film, I didn't want distractions
[01:27:50.222 --> 01:27:58.369]  And some of the things I was going to add, some of the things I just ran out of time, but other things, if you make it, if it has too much, I wanted the film to be 90 minutes.
[01:27:58.369 --> 01:28:02.013]  It ended up being 112, or 22 minutes longer than I wanted.
[01:28:02.013 --> 01:28:05.616]  The average attention span for the most effective documentary is about 85 minutes.
[01:28:07.077 --> 01:28:09.019]  Usually I make three-hour films.
[01:28:09.019 --> 01:28:16.866]  You know, like two hours forty minutes long for Endgame, three hours long plus for Martial Law, Rise of the Police State.
[01:28:16.866 --> 01:28:21.129]  So, yes, Tarpley is coming to Austin again.
[01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.891]  I'm interviewing more people.
[01:28:22.891 --> 01:28:30.477]  I've already made the decision a week ago to launch a whole nother Obama film with just what he's done in the first few months because
[01:28:31.258 --> 01:28:33.599]  It's worse than we thought in the Obama deception.
[01:28:33.599 --> 01:28:35.300]  It's moving even quicker.
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:37.760]  And so there will be another Obama film.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.082]  I will announce the details and the name of the film next week.
[01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:41.702]  How's that sound?
[01:28:41.702 --> 01:28:44.063]  Sounds great, Alex.
[01:28:44.063 --> 01:28:48.224]  And I want to create an email right now.
[01:28:48.224 --> 01:28:53.066]  Guys, David, can you get the IT guy Madden here?
[01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:54.907]  Because I want this right now.
[01:28:55.876 --> 01:29:02.479]  I want to create the email address ObamaFilm at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:02.479 --> 01:29:04.600]  They're saying no, not another email address that gets filled.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:12.804]  Yeah, no other spam and we're going to ignore everything except recommendations because the last week I've been trying to write down
[01:29:14.196 --> 01:29:18.980]  Every single thing that he's done corrupt and I literally wrote like 20 things down this morning.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.522]  I looked at notes I wrote last week.
[01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:23.264]  There's too many things for me to even keep track of it all.
[01:29:23.264 --> 01:29:26.967]  So send all your recommendations to Obamafilm.
[01:29:26.967 --> 01:29:31.111]  They're making the email address right now, Matt?
[01:29:31.111 --> 01:29:32.452]  Matt?
[01:29:32.452 --> 01:29:34.073]  Are they making that right now?
[01:29:34.073 --> 01:29:34.474]  Good.
[01:29:34.474 --> 01:29:35.615]  They're making the new address right now?
[01:29:36.803 --> 01:29:38.104]  Okay, good.
[01:29:38.104 --> 01:29:41.066]  Obamafilm at Infowars.com.
[01:29:41.066 --> 01:29:43.347]  Stay there, I'll come back and let you say anything else you wanted to say.
[01:29:43.347 --> 01:29:44.468]  You got me ranting.
[01:29:44.468 --> 01:29:45.668]  And we'll let everybody else's call.
[01:29:45.668 --> 01:29:46.329]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:46.329 --> 01:29:48.170]  This is GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:49.791]  Yes, I'm making a second film right now.
[01:29:49.791 --> 01:29:50.791]  I'm already making it.
[01:29:50.791 --> 01:29:51.412]  Ha ha!
[01:29:51.412 --> 01:29:52.793]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.793 --> 01:29:55.314]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.314 --> 01:29:57.996]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.343 --> 01:30:02.704]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:30:02.704 --> 01:30:05.127]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:30:05.127 --> 01:30:09.291]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:30:09.291 --> 01:30:11.333]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[01:30:14.801 --> 01:30:21.606]  If you're dreaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the Earth is cooling, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:30:21.606 --> 01:30:25.449]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:30:25.449 --> 01:30:31.833]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:35.436]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:30:35.436 --> 01:30:39.579]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:30:47.619 --> 01:30:50.920]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:55.122]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:31:15.012 --> 01:31:21.575]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.575 --> 01:31:23.556]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.556 --> 01:31:26.057]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.057 --> 01:31:37.002]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.301]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.301 --> 01:31:41.162]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:48.067]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.067 --> 01:31:56.332]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.332 --> 01:31:57.913]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.913 --> 01:31:59.094]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.092 --> 01:32:02.413]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.413 --> 01:32:07.996]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.996 --> 01:32:13.018]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:13.018 --> 01:32:18.581]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:23.824]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.824 --> 01:32:25.685]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:30.932]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.932 --> 01:32:32.033]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:32.033 --> 01:32:35.095]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:35.095 --> 01:32:38.738]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.738 --> 01:32:41.920]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.142]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:45.022]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.022 --> 01:32:45.242]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.242 --> 01:32:46.403]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:32:55.219 --> 01:32:57.789]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.789 --> 01:33:00.158]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:36.274]  All right, Justin, go ahead and finish up your question or point.
[01:33:36.274 --> 01:33:37.735]  Yeah, Alex, I appreciate it.
[01:33:37.735 --> 01:33:47.301]  But what I was saying was just, you know, I think it's important for everybody to understand that the nation of Israel and the bankers and Zionism and the part that it plays and all this stuff,
[01:33:47.853 --> 01:33:50.755]  As far as it goes with the Illuminati and the New World Order.
[01:34:09.165 --> 01:34:10.186]  Conservative groups.
[01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:10.766]  None of that's true.
[01:34:10.766 --> 01:34:18.331]  I'm an independent person, fighting the New World Order as best I can, and I don't like bashing, you know, the open borders and the immigrants, but I'm forced to.
[01:34:18.331 --> 01:34:20.953]  I don't like bashing the bad things Israel does, but I do it.
[01:34:20.953 --> 01:34:24.956]  I don't like bashing, you know, the Vatican, but it's calling for world government, so I'm forced to.
[01:34:24.956 --> 01:34:26.777]  I'm, you know, I'm not Catholic.
[01:34:26.777 --> 01:34:31.761]  But, you know, there's all these splinter groups that are obsessed with attacking one group or the other.
[01:34:31.761 --> 01:34:37.384]  I'm just fighting the globalist agenda to have a big tent for everybody to say, we don't want a world government run by bankers.
[01:34:38.445 --> 01:34:39.825]  We don't want to be in a police state.
[01:34:39.825 --> 01:34:42.566]  You know, that's all I'm doing.
[01:34:42.566 --> 01:34:43.466]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:43.466 --> 01:34:44.787]  Hey, another thing I was going to ask you, too.
[01:34:44.787 --> 01:34:48.847]  Have you had a chance to talk to anybody about that new Nicolas Cage movie, The Knowing, that came out?
[01:34:48.847 --> 01:34:50.288]  Have you seen that yet?
[01:34:50.288 --> 01:34:54.849]  You know, I miss a lot of things, but I did get some emails about that, but didn't have a chance to check into it.
[01:34:54.849 --> 01:34:56.369]  No, what's it about?
[01:34:56.369 --> 01:34:58.870]  Oh, it's completely illuminati.
[01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:07.932]  It's about an astrologer who stumbles onto a 50-year numerological code of about major disasters and events that are going to happen in the world.
[01:35:08.297 --> 01:35:12.158]  And basically at the end of the film there's an extinction level event that happens.
[01:35:12.158 --> 01:35:14.919]  But one of the first codes that he breaks was 9-11-2001.
[01:35:14.919 --> 01:35:19.840]  And then it gives the latitude and longitude of the attack and how many people die in it.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.041]  I mean, it's tied in pretty deep.
[01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:23.461]  Amazing.
[01:35:23.461 --> 01:35:24.382]  I'll have to check it out.
[01:35:24.382 --> 01:35:25.042]  Thank you so much.
[01:35:25.042 --> 01:35:31.424]  In fact, you guys told me two weeks ago there's a big mainstream movie out of Australia about chemtrails.
[01:35:31.424 --> 01:35:32.304]  Are you guys listening in there?
[01:35:33.171 --> 01:35:35.612]  You guys told me there was a big mainstream movie about chemtrails.
[01:35:35.612 --> 01:35:38.452]  Burmas told me about it too, and then I never covered it.
[01:35:38.452 --> 01:35:40.472]  As soon as he gets here, will you ask him what that was?
[01:35:40.472 --> 01:35:44.693]  Because I just hear all this stuff, see it, and then don't have time to cover it all or ever look into it.
[01:35:44.693 --> 01:35:45.814]  Ann Heche.
[01:35:45.814 --> 01:35:46.054]  Ann Heche.
[01:35:46.054 --> 01:35:48.834]  It premiered in Australia.
[01:35:48.834 --> 01:35:53.435]  Okay, will you pull it up, a trailer or something so I can play it when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in 25 minutes?
[01:35:53.435 --> 01:35:55.035]  Thank you so much, Rob Dew.
[01:35:55.035 --> 01:35:56.856]  Okay, Robert in California.
[01:35:56.856 --> 01:35:59.476]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:35:59.476 --> 01:36:01.457]  Good morning from California, sir.
[01:36:01.457 --> 01:36:02.097]  Welcome, my friend.
[01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:10.096]  Yeah, I've been trying to send you some things from our children's services out here in Los Angeles County.
[01:36:10.096 --> 01:36:15.300]  Hopefully they've been getting into one of your gentleman's mailbox.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.982]  I'd like to thank you for making the Obama Deception.
[01:36:17.982 --> 01:36:19.644]  I don't have any critique.
[01:36:19.644 --> 01:36:30.752]  Maybe if people do want to show it to different audiences, depending on which audience they want, they might want to maybe make their own edit as far as showing the whole movie.
[01:36:30.752 --> 01:36:32.614]  But as far as that, it's an excellent
[01:36:33.061 --> 01:36:34.122]  Excellent thing you're doing.
[01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:36.183]  I'm glad that you are adding to it.
[01:36:36.183 --> 01:36:40.946]  You might have to make a whole book series out of it.
[01:36:40.946 --> 01:36:55.514]  The other thing I wanted to bring up is, you know, I was sitting back, my wife taped a bunch of movies for me, and I just got a new appreciation for Battlefield Earth, that John Travolta movie, because it just seems like that's what's going on.
[01:36:59.241 --> 01:37:00.342]  I hear you.
[01:37:00.342 --> 01:37:01.983]  It's just insane.
[01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:03.864]  Anything else, sir?
[01:37:03.864 --> 01:37:08.707]  No, I'll be writing some letters here pretty soon from the Campaign for Liberty.
[01:37:08.707 --> 01:37:11.609]  What specifically is going on with the CPS in California?
[01:37:11.609 --> 01:37:19.594]  I know they're grabbing homeschooler children now and just kidnapping more children outside of the proper legal system.
[01:37:19.594 --> 01:37:25.098]  Well, specifically right now we are being called emergency workers.
[01:37:25.098 --> 01:37:27.600]  So that's the way, if there's a disaster or some sort of
[01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:33.831]  Uh, event here in Los Angeles County that anybody who works for the county including Children's Services
[01:37:34.397 --> 01:37:42.822]  Will be put into certain areas where they would, you know, benefit whatever's going on, whether it's counting how many people go on the train.
[01:37:42.822 --> 01:37:44.163]  Sure, that's been in mainstream news.
[01:37:44.163 --> 01:37:58.933]  For those that don't know, counties, cities, everything is being federalized under the Threat Fusion Centers, the emergency management centers, and they're going to try to forcibly inoculate all the medical workers and emergency workers first, 14 million of them.
[01:37:58.933 --> 01:38:01.775]  They already tried that in 2003, remember, with the smallpox shot?
[01:38:02.979 --> 01:38:04.199]  But most of them refused.
[01:38:04.199 --> 01:38:06.720]  99% refused according to the LA Times.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.301]  So it's very very serious.
[01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:28.705]  The other thing is they're asking a lot of studies from the congressional part of it on what we can do to better service our clients or basically what is the reporting levels that we need to report as far as like drug addiction and things like that and services that we put out or basically just handling of the case period.
[01:38:28.705 --> 01:38:32.026]  So they're collecting all their data they need to
[01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:37.040]  I guess spring their trap.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.761]  Amazing.
[01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:41.804]  So what are the workers saying?
[01:38:41.804 --> 01:38:44.286]  Are they starting to figure out what's happening?
[01:38:44.286 --> 01:38:47.088]  A few are figuring out what's happening.
[01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:48.389]  I live in Obama land.
[01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:54.714]  At the moment I see his picture and his photograph and a big cardboard cut out every time I stand up.
[01:38:54.714 --> 01:38:58.977]  So I can't wait until I get my copies of
[01:39:00.283 --> 01:39:06.665]  The Obama Deception I ordered so I can start handing them out like candy.
[01:39:06.665 --> 01:39:15.227]  They might not like me afterwards, but I'm not going to sit there and not give them the information and the truth.
[01:39:15.227 --> 01:39:28.570]  It's just a weird situation living here with on my cubicle, 9-11 was an inside job, and some people walk by and they look, and then I also have a small little
[01:39:38.402 --> 01:39:47.670]  Well, you know, I criticize the system because a hundred years ago in England and the United States, they set up the family courts to carry out eugenics.
[01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:51.993]  We cover it in Endgame, but I do know that there is also a lot of bad things going on in society.
[01:39:51.993 --> 01:39:54.335]  I know that all social workers are not bad.
[01:39:54.335 --> 01:39:55.736]  I've met quite a few that are good.
[01:39:56.837 --> 01:40:04.162]  My biggest criticism is there's also a lot of scum involved, and a lot of abusers that get involved, evidenced by all the arrests that are made continually.
[01:40:04.162 --> 01:40:07.604]  And I just don't know how good people like yourself can stay in that situation.
[01:40:07.604 --> 01:40:12.307]  I know that for CPS workers, it's over a 50% yearly turnover.
[01:40:12.307 --> 01:40:20.392]  People go get degrees in this, and for the right reasons, and they get into it, and just can't stand staying in it.
[01:40:20.392 --> 01:40:21.253]  Can you speak to that?
[01:40:22.598 --> 01:40:29.022]  Uh, most of the workers that I know, especially the ones that I work with, we work in an adoptions part of the situation.
[01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:31.304]  Oh, so you're not in the wicked part.
[01:40:31.304 --> 01:40:32.225]  I got you.
[01:40:32.225 --> 01:40:32.805]  Yeah.
[01:40:32.805 --> 01:40:42.892]  And, and, and those who did actually work in those areas have either come over here or like you said, have turned over or sort of resigned there to their fate in life.
[01:40:42.892 --> 01:40:48.976]  Um, and whatever else that might be in the office, they're pretty much either well hidden or in their own little group.
[01:40:50.069 --> 01:41:01.774]  So, we really don't deal with them except after all the termination of parental rights and all those things that have to go through as far as the semi-legal system, as they call it.
[01:41:01.774 --> 01:41:02.534]  Amazing.
[01:41:02.534 --> 01:41:02.975]  Amazing.
[01:41:02.975 --> 01:41:03.695]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:03.695 --> 01:41:05.856]  I appreciate the call.
[01:41:05.856 --> 01:41:07.997]  Let's go ahead and talk to Groom in Maryland.
[01:41:07.997 --> 01:41:08.937]  Groom, you're on the air.
[01:41:08.937 --> 01:41:10.678]  How you doing?
[01:41:10.678 --> 01:41:13.059]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:41:13.059 --> 01:41:13.959]  Good, sir.
[01:41:13.959 --> 01:41:17.181]  Another young supporter out here in Maryland.
[01:41:18.486 --> 01:41:22.327]  I find your documentary really compelling.
[01:41:22.327 --> 01:41:36.170]  I mean, you've got a lot of clear arguments, and I found the claim that Ron Paul's brother made that really stuck out to me is that we're really operating under emergency powers.
[01:41:36.170 --> 01:41:38.250]  I found that really... No, no, no, that's a fact!
[01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:47.352]  What they did is... I didn't find it shocking, but I found it really compelling, because when you state that fact, it really sticks out in people's heads.
[01:41:47.847 --> 01:41:50.970]  That social security and all that is just basically a collateral.
[01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:53.713]  We were put up as collateral?
[01:41:53.713 --> 01:41:57.116]  I mean... Yeah, they take our money and then give us a pittance back.
[01:41:57.116 --> 01:41:58.317]  It's about domestication.
[01:41:58.317 --> 01:42:01.821]  It's literal slavery.
[01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:07.306]  And I mean, yeah, I've been trying to spread the word out here and around the high schools, you know.
[01:42:07.987 --> 01:42:14.708]  I'm trying to major in economics and really, because I think that's the prime component of us really getting out of this struggle.
[01:42:14.708 --> 01:42:19.469]  What are folks saying and doing when you send them the Obama deception link?
[01:42:19.469 --> 01:42:28.311]  Oh, matter of fact, another interesting thing that happened to me, I sent, you know, HR 1388, the bill on the youth brigades.
[01:42:35.805 --> 01:42:39.748]  I sent that to my practical law teacher, and he was utterly stunned.
[01:42:39.748 --> 01:42:40.969]  Like, he didn't even know about it.
[01:42:40.969 --> 01:42:45.473]  I mentioned it in class, and he just didn't know what to say.
[01:42:45.473 --> 01:42:47.915]  I was like, he said, oh, that's horrible.
[01:42:47.915 --> 01:42:51.297]  It's not ever going to pass the way it's, um, the way he's worried about it.
[01:42:51.297 --> 01:42:56.682]  I was like, it was just stunned me that, you know, we just passed things off.
[01:42:56.682 --> 01:43:00.705]  And it just, the lightning speed that this, you know, New World Order is coming is,
[01:43:01.505 --> 01:43:06.248]  It's scary, but I mean... And that's all Barack Obama is, is a distraction.
[01:43:06.248 --> 01:43:09.930]  And when they're done with him, they're going to destroy his name as well.
[01:43:09.930 --> 01:43:13.653]  And it's a total setup, and just keep warning people.
[01:43:13.653 --> 01:43:15.034]  Keep passing them the free link.
[01:43:15.034 --> 01:43:17.795]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43:17.795 --> 01:43:20.177]  The best internet version we've found of it.
[01:43:20.177 --> 01:43:21.738]  The best quality for free.
[01:43:21.738 --> 01:43:23.719]  Get the DVDs at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:23.719 --> 01:43:24.400]  Make copies.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.921]  Put it on AXS TV.
[01:43:25.921 --> 01:43:27.001]  Everybody has my permission.
[01:43:27.001 --> 01:43:28.382]  Just keep getting it out to everybody.
[01:43:28.382 --> 01:43:30.083]  Groom, good to hear from you in Maryland.
[01:43:30.083 --> 01:43:30.784]  Keep up the good work.
[01:43:31.164 --> 01:43:31.925]  EJ in Texas.
[01:43:31.925 --> 01:43:34.086]  EJ, go ahead.
[01:43:34.086 --> 01:43:34.807]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:43:34.807 --> 01:43:36.588]  Good, sir.
[01:43:36.588 --> 01:43:45.354]  I haven't had a chance to talk with people about their reviews of your film since I just got back from out of town, but I promise to do that and I'll call back sometime with that.
[01:43:45.354 --> 01:43:48.196]  But I have one question and a couple of comments.
[01:43:48.196 --> 01:43:49.657]  I'll try to be brief.
[01:43:49.657 --> 01:44:00.645]  The question is that when you had Dr. Carleon a few days ago, towards the end of one of the segments, you had quickly mentioned how vaccines leach out of the children's bodies, and I'd like
[01:44:01.195 --> 01:44:04.358]  To understand more about that, maybe where I could go to read about that.
[01:44:04.358 --> 01:44:05.139]  Okay.
[01:44:05.139 --> 01:44:21.276]  The viral fragments or the complete viruses that are separate from what the vaccine, you know, supposedly, you know, let's say it's a flu shot that has five or six different variants of flu, a wide spectrum flu, it is grown on dead baby parts all over the world.
[01:44:21.276 --> 01:44:22.698]  They just legalized that here in the U.S.
[01:44:22.698 --> 01:44:23.198]  It's grown
[01:44:24.259 --> 01:44:48.682]  on monkey parts, ground up kidneys and other things, and then all of their viruses, similar to human viruses, the zoological viruses, and this is mainline science, merge, and there's also DNA fragments, microplasms, all of this mixes and combines with bacteria and viruses in the body, and then leaches out, creating new strains of viruses that are also carried by bacteria, but more than that,
[01:44:49.525 --> 01:44:55.887]  They admitted when they were trying to force the troops and the firemen and the police and everybody else to take the smallpox shot 2002-2003.
[01:44:55.887 --> 01:44:58.408]  I remember they said you have to take it.
[01:44:58.408 --> 01:45:00.068]  There was no law, they just said you have to take it.
[01:45:00.068 --> 01:45:02.789]  Just like they tell citizens we have to take stuff with no law.
[01:45:02.789 --> 01:45:07.651]  But thank God the police and military and even Tommy Thompson refused to take it, though he was saying everybody else had to take it.
[01:45:08.604 --> 01:45:19.688]  That they were admitting that it could actually cause and was causing some localized smallpox outbreaks that have been extincted in the western world because it was a live smallpox injection.
[01:45:19.688 --> 01:45:23.630]  Okay, so people can actually get what they're being vaccinated for.
[01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:24.670]  Here's an example.
[01:45:24.670 --> 01:45:30.392]  Really nice lady, family friend, a nurse, known my grandmother since high school.
[01:45:30.392 --> 01:45:35.694]  She took a shingle shot vaccine right when it came out last year and almost killed her.
[01:45:35.694 --> 01:45:36.575]  She got shingles.
[01:45:37.375 --> 01:45:39.557]  And they said it was a bad vaccine reaction.
[01:45:39.557 --> 01:45:41.359]  So there's just case after case.
[01:45:41.359 --> 01:45:43.180]  Look at the swine flu epidemic.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:45.162]  So yes, they leach out, sir.
[01:45:45.162 --> 01:45:45.843]  Okay.
[01:45:45.843 --> 01:45:49.466]  Well, I think it'd be really good to have Dr. Deagle on there again to kind of
[01:45:51.173 --> 01:45:54.896]  I don't get to synthesize all this stuff and what's happening with the avian flu as well.
[01:45:54.896 --> 01:45:57.457]  He's just such a wealth of information.
[01:45:57.457 --> 01:45:58.158]  He is, listen.
[01:45:58.158 --> 01:45:59.839]  Go ahead.
[01:45:59.839 --> 01:46:03.181]  Michael Bagnerik, the constitutional class guy.
[01:46:03.181 --> 01:46:05.303]  You know, I said I was going to have Bagnerik on.
[01:46:05.303 --> 01:46:07.684]  Setting Michael Bagnerik up for like two hours.
[01:46:07.684 --> 01:46:08.124]  Thank you, sir.
[01:46:08.124 --> 01:46:09.705]  I'm going to jump, EJ.
[01:46:09.705 --> 01:46:14.889]  Jay in Nebraska, you're on the air.
[01:46:14.889 --> 01:46:16.150]  Go ahead, Jay in Nebraska.
[01:46:17.605 --> 01:46:18.605]  Yeah, he's gone.
[01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:20.606]  Okay, Dallas in Canada.
[01:46:20.606 --> 01:46:21.227]  Dallas.
[01:46:21.227 --> 01:46:22.647]  I didn't know Dallas was in Canada.
[01:46:22.647 --> 01:46:24.048]  Welcome, Dallas.
[01:46:24.048 --> 01:46:25.049]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:46:25.049 --> 01:46:26.049]  Good, sir.
[01:46:26.049 --> 01:46:26.950]  Can you hear me good?
[01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:27.430]  Excellent.
[01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:28.270]  Excellent.
[01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:31.192]  Alex, I'm proud of your work and what you've done.
[01:46:31.192 --> 01:46:33.853]  I'm a member of a party in British Columbia.
[01:46:33.853 --> 01:46:35.874]  We're called the BC Refed Party.
[01:46:35.874 --> 01:46:40.216]  We're running for the next election in May 10th in British Columbia.
[01:46:40.216 --> 01:46:44.578]  And we're well aware of what's going on with the system up here and down there.
[01:46:44.578 --> 01:46:45.338]  Thanks to you and your
[01:46:46.909 --> 01:46:49.470]  Co-workers helping you out and etc.
[01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:51.832]  I just wanted to give you a heads up on that one.
[01:46:51.832 --> 01:46:56.674]  And the biggest thing I'd like you to do for us is mention our name.
[01:46:56.674 --> 01:47:00.476]  Is there any possible way that we could actually do an interview with you?
[01:47:00.476 --> 01:47:03.678]  Well, tell folks about your group.
[01:47:03.678 --> 01:47:06.239]  Okay, well, we're the Bilderberg Group.
[01:47:06.239 --> 01:47:08.500]  We're well aware of the economy in British Columbia right now.
[01:47:10.091 --> 01:47:12.472]  We have little or no coverage with our media.
[01:47:12.472 --> 01:47:17.474]  They're all being owned by... So you call your group the Bilderberg Group?
[01:47:17.474 --> 01:47:20.636]  No, we call ourselves the BC Refed.
[01:47:20.636 --> 01:47:22.056]  You can find us on the internet.
[01:47:22.056 --> 01:47:24.457]  It's http://www.refedbc.com.
[01:47:24.457 --> 01:47:26.678]  Okay, tell us what you're about.
[01:47:26.678 --> 01:47:29.860]  Well, we're about democracy.
[01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:45.689]  We want to end the corruption we've got running in British Columbia right now with the elite corporations buying up everything we have.
[01:47:45.689 --> 01:47:49.911]  We've lost our ferries to elite corporations across in Europe.
[01:47:49.911 --> 01:47:53.133]  Yeah, they're grabbing up all the infrastructure with the unlimited cash.
[01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:55.614]  They're bank robbers creating nothing.
[01:47:55.614 --> 01:47:57.676]  Oh, they're stealing everything.
[01:47:57.676 --> 01:48:01.198]  Right now we're going through the NAU agreement and the SPP agreement.
[01:48:01.198 --> 01:48:02.558]  We have a new agreement in British Columbia.
[01:48:02.558 --> 01:48:03.319]  It's called the Kilma.
[01:48:04.235 --> 01:48:09.179]  Which actually takes our sovereignty from each of our provinces right across Canada.
[01:48:09.179 --> 01:48:12.321]  And they're doing this behind secret meetings, secret doors, but we're getting out there.
[01:48:12.321 --> 01:48:14.422]  People are starting to notice what's going on.
[01:48:14.422 --> 01:48:16.504]  And it's very frustrating.
[01:48:16.504 --> 01:48:21.847]  Our big news media is CBC, which is Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Canada.
[01:48:21.847 --> 01:48:25.670]  We've... Give me one second, there are trains going by.
[01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:31.114]  But the biggest thing is that we can't get the big media, which is owned by them, we all know that, right?
[01:48:33.107 --> 01:48:35.448]  Well, Dallas, I'm here.
[01:48:35.448 --> 01:48:37.548]  I assure you I'm here, my friend.
[01:48:37.548 --> 01:48:38.729]  Yeah, I'm just getting blocked off.
[01:48:38.729 --> 01:48:39.989]  There's some noise.
[01:48:39.989 --> 01:48:43.550]  But we're working our butts off up here trying to get people formed.
[01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:45.671]  Well, folks, join you and get involved, Dallas.
[01:48:45.671 --> 01:48:47.291]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:47.291 --> 01:48:49.852]  Matthews in Texas, go ahead.
[01:48:49.852 --> 01:48:54.073]  Love the show.
[01:48:54.073 --> 01:48:55.814]  I have a question.
[01:48:55.814 --> 01:48:59.335]  Earlier, in late January, you had Jordan Maxwell on the show.
[01:48:59.335 --> 01:48:59.535]  Yes.
[01:49:01.252 --> 01:49:10.079]  You and he discussed, kind of casually, about getting together and making some information available about Obama's symbol, about the rising sun.
[01:49:10.079 --> 01:49:15.244]  And I just heard that you're going to make another Obama film, and I was wondering if you might incorporate that in that next film.
[01:49:15.244 --> 01:49:16.164]  You know, here's the deal.
[01:49:16.164 --> 01:49:24.191]  I'm very honored that Jordan has reached out on and off air to me to be the director of a film about the sum of his work.
[01:49:24.191 --> 01:49:29.535]  And I've told Jordan that if he gives me specifics and tells me, you know, I have to
[01:49:30.236 --> 01:49:30.877]  Have a script?
[01:49:47.069 --> 01:49:49.790]  I mean, I'm sure it would be a very successful film and reach a lot of people.
[01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:51.491]  We know what Black Sun symbolizes.
[01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:53.393]  That was the secret Nazi symbol.
[01:49:53.393 --> 01:50:07.262]  That's an ancient symbol that goes way back thousands of years, and it deals with mass extermination, and we've covered it here, and it's a very occultic symbol that Obama uses.
[01:50:07.262 --> 01:50:09.183]  Yeah, it's very hypnotic, too.
[01:50:09.183 --> 01:50:10.784]  All right, well, that's all I wanted to ask.
[01:50:10.784 --> 01:50:11.524]  I love your show.
[01:50:11.524 --> 01:50:11.945]  Thank you.
[01:50:11.945 --> 01:50:13.886]  You're a hero, and I'll keep listening.
[01:50:14.793 --> 01:50:15.373]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:15.373 --> 01:50:16.054]  Good to hear from you.
[01:50:16.054 --> 01:50:18.776]  Have you watched Conan the Barbarian?
[01:50:18.776 --> 01:50:22.478]  You know, that's the symbol of Thulsa Doom is the black sun.
[01:50:22.478 --> 01:50:24.799]  And that was the Nazi secret symbol.
[01:50:24.799 --> 01:50:27.801]  And Jim Mars has covered that in detail here on air and written a book about it.
[01:50:27.801 --> 01:50:32.024]  It's in his Nazi book that we carry, The Fourth Reich.
[01:50:32.024 --> 01:50:38.408]  And he shows how the German government gave a big black sun to a major city in Tennessee.
[01:50:40.037 --> 01:50:41.618]  After World War II.
[01:50:41.618 --> 01:50:43.198]  Black Sun.
[01:50:43.198 --> 01:50:47.380]  I mean, you see that all over media.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:50.941]  The evil mafia group in some of the Star Wars books that they're fighting.
[01:50:50.941 --> 01:50:52.042]  The Empire's even fighting.
[01:50:52.042 --> 01:50:54.222]  It's called Black Sun Corporation.
[01:50:54.222 --> 01:50:58.124]  Alright, we're going to come back with more of your calls as promised and a ton of news.
[01:50:58.124 --> 01:51:00.905]  Huge news blitz coming up next hour and more of your calls.
[01:51:01.465 --> 01:51:04.708]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[01:51:04.708 --> 01:51:07.050]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:51:07.050 --> 01:51:10.654]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:51:10.654 --> 01:51:11.594]  Be smart.
[01:51:11.594 --> 01:51:12.575]  Be safe.
[01:51:12.575 --> 01:51:14.777]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:51:24.246 --> 01:51:24.746]  We're good to go.

[01:51:57.773 --> 01:52:07.181]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.959 --> 01:52:13.823]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.823 --> 01:52:20.328]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.328 --> 01:52:22.309]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.309 --> 01:52:24.771]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:35.659]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.944 --> 01:52:39.604]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.604 --> 01:52:41.465]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.465 --> 01:52:48.387]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:58.210 --> 01:52:59.410]  The people strike back.
[01:53:02.023 --> 01:53:08.187]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:53:08.187 --> 01:53:14.611]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:53:14.611 --> 01:53:20.355]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:53:20.355 --> 01:53:23.317]  Starve or surrender.
[01:53:23.317 --> 01:53:27.119]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:53:27.119 --> 01:53:28.000]  What then?
[01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:33.790]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.

[01:54:13.375 --> 01:54:28.110]  Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me
[01:54:31.823 --> 01:54:35.245]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:54:35.245 --> 01:54:37.606]  Randy in California, you're on the air.
[01:54:44.913 --> 01:54:46.194]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:46.194 --> 01:54:57.480]  Alex, listen, I've been trying to get through for a month now, and it's so hard to get through to your show, and there's so many things I wanted to talk about a month ago are already being covered up by new things.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.061]  It's amazing, the quickening.
[01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:02.683]  But so, Alex, I decided to change the pace a little bit.
[01:55:02.683 --> 01:55:07.966]  I just wanted to take my opportunity to thank you personally, Alex.
[01:55:07.966 --> 01:55:09.727]  I speak on behalf of so many people.
[01:55:09.727 --> 01:55:12.769]  I know you're a humble man, but you and your staff
[01:55:13.610 --> 01:55:14.911]  I don't know.
[01:55:21.574 --> 01:55:28.699]  You're talking to these idiots and it sounds like your head's going to explode and I have to laugh because I've been there and I am there still.
[01:55:52.114 --> 01:56:09.644]  Absolutely, and one other thing I want to say, Alex, it's kind of funny, I heard you a couple weeks ago, you had the filmmakers on, and you made a comment about Pumpkinhead or something, and I thought it was kind of funny, but you know something Alex, I thought about something, here's how I look at you.
[01:56:09.644 --> 01:56:12.906]  Alex, you are like a pit bull for the truth.
[01:56:12.906 --> 01:56:18.429]  That is my new nickname for you, because you get on somebody's leg, and you don't let go.
[01:56:19.436 --> 01:56:23.599]  I am naming you the Pitbull for the truth.
[01:56:23.599 --> 01:56:26.981]  Alex, thank you so much once again and your staff.
[01:56:26.981 --> 01:56:28.321]  Keep up the good work, my friend.
[01:56:28.321 --> 01:56:29.982]  Randy, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:29.982 --> 01:56:31.023]  God bless you.
[01:56:31.023 --> 01:56:31.883]  Bill in Iowa.
[01:56:31.883 --> 01:56:32.724]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:56:32.724 --> 01:56:37.327]  Yeah, I prefer you to be called a German Shepherd.
[01:56:37.327 --> 01:56:40.008]  I don't like Pitbull.
[01:56:40.008 --> 01:56:41.329]  Okay, well let's stop talking about me.
[01:56:41.329 --> 01:56:42.670]  What's on your mind?
[01:56:42.670 --> 01:56:48.113]  Okay, we were talking earlier about the mandatory
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:49.720]  I
[01:57:05.236 --> 01:57:09.699]  To have 200 and some odd hours of community service.
[01:57:35.776 --> 01:57:43.921]  But it's not really doing that, it's just absolutely amazing that this is happening, and the same stuff is being set up in England.
[01:57:43.921 --> 01:57:56.529]  Yeah, these kids are working at local eating establishments, like they're taking the jobs away from people that might really need those jobs.
[01:57:56.529 --> 01:58:01.432]  Anyway, another thing, what's the latest on Colonel Don DeGrand Prix?
[01:58:01.432 --> 01:58:03.493]  Have we found out how he's doing?
[01:58:03.493 --> 01:58:04.093]  Yes, he died.
[01:58:05.775 --> 01:58:08.758]  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:58:08.758 --> 01:58:10.981]  Well, anyway, thanks Alex.
[01:58:10.981 --> 01:58:12.182]  You're doing a great job.
[01:58:12.182 --> 01:58:12.803]  Thank you, sir.
[01:58:12.803 --> 01:58:13.784]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:15.273 --> 01:58:22.719]  Alright, we're going to start the next hour, take a few more calls, and then I've got Ed Martin, spokesman for Missourians United for Life.
[01:58:22.719 --> 01:58:30.104]  They have gotten involved in a legal move, and that's good, that's what we've been calling for here, against the Missouri government.
[01:58:30.104 --> 01:58:35.568]  Civil liberties complaint filed against Jay Nixon, the governor, for abuse of state law enforcement.
[01:58:35.568 --> 01:58:38.450]  Temporary restraining order sought against Nixon and U.S.
[01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:42.673]  District Court.
[01:58:42.673 --> 01:58:44.415]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.063 --> 01:58:52.764]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.764 --> 01:58:57.508]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.508 --> 01:59:00.470]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:03.512]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.512 --> 01:59:09.357]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.577 --> 01:59:12.822]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.822 --> 01:59:19.812]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:59:53.829 --> 01:59:56.211]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.841]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.841 --> 02:00:11.302]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.302 --> 02:00:12.803]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.559 --> 02:00:17.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[02:00:30.284 --> 02:00:32.685]  We're live from 1 p.m.
[02:00:32.685 --> 02:00:33.225]  to 3 p.m.
[02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:36.906]  We are simulcasting right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:36.906 --> 02:00:42.028]  Coming up in the next segment, Ed Martin, spokesman for Missourians United for Life,
[02:00:42.848 --> 02:00:48.213]  Civil liberties complaint filed against Jane Nixon, the governor, for abuse of state law enforcement.
[02:00:48.213 --> 02:00:51.036]  Temporary restraining order sought against Nixon in U.S.
[02:00:51.036 --> 02:00:51.717]  District Court.
[02:00:51.717 --> 02:00:53.719]  The ACLU is involved.
[02:00:56.423 --> 02:01:11.435]  So this is going on right now because they list basically pro-life groups, Second Amendment groups, anybody who's against gun control, anybody who believes in the North American Union as cop-killing terrorists.
[02:01:11.435 --> 02:01:13.116]  We broke this two weeks ago.
[02:01:13.116 --> 02:01:16.559]  It is now an international story covered by CNN, Fox, you name it.
[02:01:16.559 --> 02:01:18.561]  But they put their spin on it like, is this good?
[02:01:18.561 --> 02:01:19.361]  Maybe it is.
[02:01:19.361 --> 02:01:20.783]  Maybe these people could be terrorists.
[02:01:21.764 --> 02:01:23.767]  So that's what's going on and happening there.
[02:01:23.767 --> 02:01:27.052]  The Governor, as of last night, did retract.
[02:01:27.052 --> 02:01:29.515]  Friday he said he was all for it and stood behind it.
[02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:35.184]  Now he's saying he's against it as soon as he finally got the chance to read the letter from Congressman Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and others.
[02:01:39.238 --> 02:01:42.199]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:42.199 --> 02:01:45.459]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:01:45.459 --> 02:01:51.240]  Let's talk to Brian in California, then Jason, Kalash, Michael and Mike and others.
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:52.660]  Go ahead, you're on the air Brian.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:54.841]  Thank you Alex Jones.
[02:01:54.841 --> 02:02:02.742]  I just want to say I love your work and I love the Obamaception and I'm handing it out to as many people as I can.
[02:02:02.742 --> 02:02:04.503]  First let me ask you, what are they saying when they get a copy?
[02:02:06.893 --> 02:02:09.054]  People, I think people are pretty surprised.
[02:02:09.054 --> 02:02:11.755]  Some people are pretty hesitant to take it.
[02:02:11.755 --> 02:02:14.176]  And I've got death threats, too.
[02:02:14.176 --> 02:02:19.738]  People telling me that I should be killed, or calling me a Republican or a racist, and all that, too.
[02:02:19.738 --> 02:02:26.421]  But my main reason for the call is the draft bill passed the Senate, 74 to 14.
[02:02:26.421 --> 02:02:27.762]  I don't know if you were aware of that.
[02:02:27.762 --> 02:02:28.422]  No, I wasn't.
[02:02:28.422 --> 02:02:29.382]  I can't keep track of it all.
[02:02:29.382 --> 02:02:30.843]  What is the Senate bill on that?
[02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:32.283]  I actually had it printed out.
[02:02:32.283 --> 02:02:34.064]  I think they're calling it the...
[02:02:36.724 --> 02:02:39.527]  What is it?
[02:02:39.527 --> 02:02:42.910]  Service for All Ages Act or something like that?
[02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:55.002]  Guys, Google Service for All Ages Act, pull up Paul Watson's article from Thursday, but I predicted it would pass the Senate because they're even more globalist than the House on average.
[02:02:55.002 --> 02:02:56.784]  It passed the House by, what, over 100 plus votes.
[02:02:58.565 --> 02:02:59.886]  Oh gosh, I can't remember.
[02:03:25.774 --> 02:03:28.015]  It's the Service for All Ages.
[02:03:28.015 --> 02:03:29.736]  Yeah, Service for All Ages Act.
[02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:30.877]  Service for All Ages Act.
[02:03:30.877 --> 02:03:31.958]  Get it?
[02:03:31.958 --> 02:03:41.744]  In fact, I was just during the one-minute break because there's all these piles of papers and I'm trying to keep track of it all and I, you know, we wrote an article about it last Thursday and I was trying to pull that back up.
[02:03:41.744 --> 02:03:44.986]  This is just horrible news.
[02:03:44.986 --> 02:03:46.106]  I just got a splitting headache.
[02:03:46.106 --> 02:03:47.887]  I mean, this is just so horrible what's happening.
[02:03:47.887 --> 02:03:48.928]  Go ahead.
[02:03:48.928 --> 02:03:53.591]  I noticed on the blogs, too, where I was reading about it, there's a whole bunch of people that are
[02:03:54.443 --> 02:04:00.345]  Obama supporters that are totally in shock and never saw this coming, and I just don't know why people vote.
[02:04:00.345 --> 02:04:03.326]  If you don't look up who you're voting for, don't vote.
[02:04:03.326 --> 02:04:06.087]  If you don't research it, don't vote.
[02:04:06.087 --> 02:04:10.048]  And people are going to get what's coming to them, and I really hate that.
[02:04:10.048 --> 02:04:13.969]  And I have kids of my own, and they'll be drafted before he's done.
[02:04:15.188 --> 02:04:18.029]  Well, they're introducing this idea, and they're going to phase it in.
[02:04:18.029 --> 02:04:27.214]  See, notice it was first, oh, it's usaservice.org, join us, soup kitchens, to give it a nice sound, and oh, by the way, military training and fugitive apprehension.
[02:04:27.214 --> 02:04:30.356]  We're going to train your kids with guns to how to take on terrorists.
[02:04:30.356 --> 02:04:34.037]  I mean, that's in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:04:34.037 --> 02:04:35.478]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:04:35.478 --> 02:04:37.559]  They write so many articles at prisonplanet.com.
[02:04:37.559 --> 02:04:40.601]  I'm trying to find the story from last Thursday.
[02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:44.897]  I just can't keep track of it anymore.
[02:04:44.897 --> 02:04:45.657]  Here it is.
[02:04:45.657 --> 02:04:50.902]  That's the civilian force in England of 60,000 trying to spot terrorists.
[02:04:50.902 --> 02:04:55.066]  There's just so many of these to try to keep track of right now.
[02:04:57.116 --> 02:04:58.276]  I'm looking for it right here.
[02:04:58.276 --> 02:05:00.117]  Oh man.
[02:05:00.117 --> 02:05:01.258]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.258 --> 02:05:04.759]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.759 --> 02:05:08.540]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:14.842]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[02:05:14.842 --> 02:05:18.944]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:19.464 --> 02:05:25.488]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:25.488 --> 02:05:28.911]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:28.911 --> 02:05:33.574]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:33.574 --> 02:05:39.798]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:44.781]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:05:49.124 --> 02:05:51.985]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.

[02:05:59.408 --> 02:06:00.088]  Don't wait.
[02:06:00.088 --> 02:06:01.869]  Call today.
[02:06:01.869 --> 02:06:07.891]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.891 --> 02:06:13.153]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.783 --> 02:06:20.267]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.267 --> 02:06:22.249]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.249 --> 02:06:24.710]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:37.899]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:06:37.899 --> 02:06:39.580]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:40.941]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:06:41.425 --> 02:06:48.329]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:06:58.175 --> 02:06:59.356]  The people strike back.
[02:07:00.899 --> 02:07:06.301]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[02:07:06.301 --> 02:07:14.865]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:07:14.865 --> 02:07:18.426]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:07:18.426 --> 02:07:21.668]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[02:07:21.668 --> 02:07:24.149]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[02:08:02.868 --> 02:08:09.492]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.492 --> 02:08:12.474]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.245 --> 02:08:18.566]  Alright, here's the deal.
[02:08:18.566 --> 02:08:21.948]  So much is happening so fast, I can't even track it anymore.
[02:08:21.948 --> 02:08:29.854]  We're trying to confirm that the Senate passed the National Compulsory Service Act.
[02:08:29.854 --> 02:08:31.555]  Now that's what they called it before.
[02:08:31.555 --> 02:08:35.798]  They changed the name to something else.
[02:08:35.798 --> 02:08:36.539]  It passed the
[02:08:38.556 --> 02:08:40.877]  House last Thursday, we wrote an article about that.
[02:08:40.877 --> 02:08:45.680]  I was just scrambling during the three-minute break because the caller spurred me to think about that.
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:47.921]  I thought I had it in my stack today to cover on air.
[02:08:47.921 --> 02:08:48.722]  I don't.
[02:08:48.722 --> 02:08:51.383]  We're floundering around trying to get all these together.
[02:08:51.383 --> 02:08:53.024]  Paul Watson's going to have that at the 20 after.
[02:08:54.716 --> 02:09:01.357]  And the Senate version and it's just so much is happening so fast I can't even keep track of this anymore.
[02:09:01.357 --> 02:09:05.758]  They've got bills on the verge of passing to basically ban gardens without federal licensing.
[02:09:05.758 --> 02:09:07.898]  The feds are taking everything over.
[02:09:07.898 --> 02:09:17.840]  Two weeks ago we broke the MIAC report here on air and now that's got international attention.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.441]  The governor wouldn't apologize and said he backed it last Friday in the Associated Press.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:25.181]  Then the governor, legal action was started against him.
[02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:44.187]  Ron Paul sent him a letter and Bob Barr sent him a letter together with Chuck Baldwin and he's now saying that he repudiates the fact that Ron Paul and others are listed in that and that it does demonize them and their supporters, wrongfully equating them with terrorists.
[02:09:44.187 --> 02:09:45.968]  So that's some good news.
[02:09:45.968 --> 02:09:51.850]  And here is the March 24th article, Expanding National Service, New York Times.
[02:09:54.287 --> 02:10:01.831]  And yeah, this is the New York Times reporting today on the 24th that it was before the Senate for a vote.
[02:10:01.831 --> 02:10:08.995]  Now we're getting calls that it did pass.
[02:10:08.995 --> 02:10:10.836]  I mean, this is just off the charts.
[02:10:10.836 --> 02:10:14.698]  It gave me a few things give me an instant headache.
[02:10:14.698 --> 02:10:15.479]  But this just did it.
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:24.691]  I'm trying to find the name of the bill here because it's in the article but we write so many articles I can't find it on PrisonPlanet.com, the detailed one.
[02:10:30.799 --> 02:10:32.100]  Just unbelievable.
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:34.642]  This country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:10:34.642 --> 02:10:38.124]  Ed Martin, spokesman for the Missourians United for Life.
[02:10:38.124 --> 02:10:43.168]  Pro-life groups were demonized basically as terrorists, cop-killers as well in this Missouri document that the Feds wrote.
[02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:45.370]  The Governor says the Feds wrote it, we already knew that.
[02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:47.231]  So I want to bring him up.
[02:10:47.231 --> 02:10:56.858]  They have moved civil libertarians, Liberties complaint filed against Governor Jay Nixon for abuse of state law enforcement, temporarily restraining order, sought against Nixon in U.S.
[02:10:56.858 --> 02:10:58.660]  District Court.
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:00.001]  And it's good to have you on with us, sir.
[02:11:00.999 --> 02:11:01.659]  Thank you, sir.
[02:11:01.659 --> 02:11:03.840]  Thanks for having me.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:06.681]  You know, if you don't mind, I'd like to clarify a couple things.
[02:11:06.681 --> 02:11:11.944]  You actually were more optimistic than the facts on the ground warrant.
[02:11:11.944 --> 02:11:18.066]  What is actually true is that the governor of the state of Missouri has not apologized to anyone.
[02:11:18.066 --> 02:11:21.568]  He trotted out a bureaucrat to apologize.
[02:11:21.568 --> 02:11:26.690]  The apology, candidly, simply says we're going to take the names of the third party candidates
[02:11:27.666 --> 02:11:32.249]  Barr, Baldwin, and Paul out of the document, but we're going to reissue the document.
[02:11:32.249 --> 02:11:51.959]  So, they're standing by the fact, they're just trying to sugarcoat things, and the Governor, Governor Jay Nixon, continues to stand by the statements in here, in this incredible document that is, you know, I have now, I have some sources, and I'm trying to put it together, that a lot of the language was lifted from some of the left-wing
[02:11:52.706 --> 02:11:56.109]  Uh, organizations, uh, websites and reports and things.
[02:11:56.109 --> 02:12:08.358]  I'm trying to figure out exactly where, but this is, um, this is exactly the kind of stuff we feared when last year, again, in Missouri, we saw the Obama truth squads, uh, with prosecutors, Bob McCulloch of St.
[02:12:08.358 --> 02:12:15.383]  Louis County saying they're going to use, uh, local law enforcement if they don't like what someone says about then-candidate Obama.
[02:12:16.952 --> 02:12:23.515]  I know, and we reported that out of the local newspaper in Kansas City, and people thought we were making it up on air.
[02:12:23.515 --> 02:12:31.758]  Then we played newscast with the police and prosecutors, saying, if you talk bad about him, we'll decide if it's a lie, and we will prosecute you.
[02:12:31.758 --> 02:12:36.321]  That was on the news, and the previous governor repudiated it.
[02:12:36.321 --> 02:12:40.362]  And yes, the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, that's who writes this for the feds.
[02:12:40.362 --> 02:12:45.245]  I've seen these reports from all the other states, and it's just outrageous.
[02:12:46.209 --> 02:12:46.869]  Yeah, it sure is.
[02:12:46.869 --> 02:12:57.594]  And again, what we're seeing in Missouri is the Governor, Governor Nixon, he's really gone sort of, just like President Obama, brazenly charging ahead.
[02:12:57.594 --> 02:13:00.616]  I mean, he's now targeting conservatives like this.
[02:13:00.616 --> 02:13:05.858]  He's appointed the most brazenly pro-illegal immigration cabinet director ever.
[02:13:05.858 --> 02:13:11.361]  And when people started to make a noise, he threatened to withhold funds from counties where people were bringing up the issue.
[02:13:11.361 --> 02:13:15.363]  And, you know, it's just one thing after another, and it has to make you really wonder and worry.
[02:13:16.937 --> 02:13:20.280]  Absolutely.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:30.851]  Our group charged ahead and we have very little in common with the ACLU too often, but we went to the ACLU and said, you guys are supposed to be standing up for civil liberties.
[02:13:30.851 --> 02:13:36.337]  This is an example and let's use your own clout and go ahead.
[02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:38.351]  Betraying their true colors.
[02:13:38.351 --> 02:13:42.253]  We've heard not nary a word from them and they're not assisting in any way.
[02:13:42.253 --> 02:13:43.473]  Okay, so I was wrong about that.
[02:13:43.473 --> 02:13:47.195]  They're seeking, you're seeking their help.
[02:13:47.195 --> 02:13:50.316]  That's terrible.
[02:13:50.316 --> 02:13:55.357]  What was it like when your group first learned about the Mayak Report?
[02:13:55.357 --> 02:13:57.598]  Well, it's exactly what you said earlier.
[02:13:57.598 --> 02:14:00.519]  People heard about it and they didn't know what to make of it.
[02:14:00.519 --> 02:14:05.861]  So our group took calls from pro-lifers and Christian conservatives who were
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:11.884]  You know, who are going about their business and saying their prayers and being participants in democracy.
[02:14:11.884 --> 02:14:13.905]  And they said, what does this mean?
[02:14:13.905 --> 02:14:14.906]  What are they talking about?
[02:14:14.906 --> 02:14:18.748]  I mean, what am I supposed to not display a bumper sticker on my car?
[02:14:18.748 --> 02:14:20.609]  Because that's one of the things the report says.
[02:14:20.609 --> 02:14:25.232]  And, you know, this is what I find so reprehensible.
[02:14:25.232 --> 02:14:30.295]  When you put out a report like this, this is why it chills free speech and behavior.
[02:14:30.295 --> 02:14:31.276]  You put it out and then
[02:14:31.741 --> 02:14:42.725]  You apologize to a bureaucrat in a closed door room with a few people and most of the people never hear the apology, which wasn't aimed by the way at Christians or pro-lifers or anything else.
[02:14:42.725 --> 02:14:45.726]  And most people are disturbed and they wonder what's going on.
[02:14:45.726 --> 02:14:47.066]  I don't know.
[02:14:47.066 --> 02:14:51.188]  I think it's a very difficult time in America when our governments are behaving like they are.
[02:14:51.188 --> 02:14:51.888]  It's very worrying.
[02:14:54.088 --> 02:14:55.790]  Absolutely.
[02:14:55.790 --> 02:15:07.765]  What do you think of Obama and 13 million supporters going door-to-door this weekend trying to get people to quote pledge to go along with his economic, military and domestic agenda and now the House has passed a national draft.
[02:15:07.765 --> 02:15:12.331]  It says compulsory service and the AP is reporting that
[02:15:12.791 --> 02:15:14.953]  The Senate is taking up debate today.
[02:15:14.953 --> 02:15:17.114]  We're getting calls saying it passed.
[02:15:17.114 --> 02:15:19.336]  We haven't been able to confirm that yet.
[02:15:19.336 --> 02:15:21.318]  I mean, this is just totally un-American.
[02:15:21.318 --> 02:15:23.219]  This isn't just a military draft.
[02:15:23.219 --> 02:15:24.220]  It's military as well.
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:27.222]  This is a full takeover of society.
[02:15:27.222 --> 02:15:32.586]  Yeah, and look, one of the things that... Maybe this is what President Obama meant by change.
[02:15:32.586 --> 02:15:36.129]  One of the things that most candidates do when they're elected is they govern.
[02:15:36.129 --> 02:15:39.692]  And they stop campaigning and they stop acting like a candidate.
[02:15:39.692 --> 02:15:41.453]  And what President Obama has made clear is
[02:15:42.326 --> 02:15:43.947]  You know, he is not going to stop doing that.
[02:15:43.947 --> 02:15:57.393]  And these door-to-door and these meetings and all, it's less about governing and more about continuing to try to use the media as well as grassroots to persuade people in a way that I think is unfair.
[02:15:57.393 --> 02:15:58.013]  Well, that's it.
[02:15:58.013 --> 02:15:59.173]  No, no, no.
[02:15:59.173 --> 02:16:02.495]  On CNN, they call it an army.
[02:16:02.495 --> 02:16:07.077]  They call it an army to bully Congress and the rest of the people along with it.
[02:16:07.777 --> 02:16:23.790]  I mean, this is like Mussolini or Mao, and that's how they modeled it, even the Washington Post admits that, to literally have his own private army and they run national TV ads for usaservice.org with federal money to then get people to join his private group.
[02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:32.017]  I mean, this is totally un-American, and the San Francisco Chronicle on Friday admitted this has never been done before in the United States.
[02:16:33.544 --> 02:16:45.127]  Yeah, I mean, again, all politics is local, and when I see the state highway patrol and local law enforcement being hijacked by a governor who so brazenly, as you said, the AP reporter,
[02:16:45.492 --> 02:16:47.993]  You know, Governor Jay Nixon just said, well, sure, I stand by it.
[02:16:47.993 --> 02:16:51.455]  I know it's profiling Christians and conservatives, but I stand by it.
[02:16:51.455 --> 02:16:52.515]  So brazen.
[02:16:52.515 --> 02:16:54.296]  And you see Obama, so brazen.
[02:16:54.296 --> 02:17:03.040]  I mean, there's something about America's greatness was a certain deference and respect to each other and for each other and for our individuality.
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:13.690]  Well, Mr. Martin, as you know, they are federalizing everything, mainstream news, putting regular army in every major police department, announcing 20,000 regular army troops to engage the American people.
[02:17:13.690 --> 02:17:15.732]  The Army War College admits that.
[02:17:15.732 --> 02:17:17.074]  And this is bigger than Obama.
[02:17:17.074 --> 02:17:18.555]  Bush helped set this up.
[02:17:18.555 --> 02:17:19.736]  He passed it on to him.
[02:17:19.736 --> 02:17:21.358]  This is the National Security Council.
[02:17:21.818 --> 02:17:24.540]  As the New York Times said, literally taking over.
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:28.502]  They told Congress that they can't see PDD 51, the full document.
[02:17:28.502 --> 02:17:33.105]  The cover sheet says the president is basically a dictator.
[02:17:33.105 --> 02:17:39.549]  I mean, I think that Americans have had liberty so long, they don't know how to recognize, and the state police reports that the feds have written
[02:17:40.109 --> 02:17:45.072]  That they're putting out literally is to create a chilling effect where people are scared to be politically active.
[02:17:45.072 --> 02:17:50.856]  That's why Obama's people threatened to have police arrest folks that criticized him in your own state.
[02:17:50.856 --> 02:18:00.862]  This is secret police, and this is meant to teach police that Americans that are against the private Federal Reserve, or against abortion, or against gun control, are cop-killing terrorists.
[02:18:00.862 --> 02:18:04.444]  I mean, this is classic Soviet-style takeover.
[02:18:05.535 --> 02:18:07.296]  Yeah, it's very, very disturbing.
[02:18:07.296 --> 02:18:14.398]  I agree with you, and I think more and more people, my one hope is that more and more people are getting more attentive to what's happening, and we're seeing it.
[02:18:14.398 --> 02:18:22.001]  Missourians United for Life has seen an uptick in the number of people who are contacting us, asking us how they can help and be a part of it, and we have to count on
[02:18:22.677 --> 02:18:26.740]  Count on shows like yours and others to try to get the word out and have people keep getting motivated.
[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:28.121]  Exactly, that's the answer.
[02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:30.402]  Don't be chilled by these bullies.
[02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:32.424]  Don't be chilled by their threats.
[02:18:32.424 --> 02:18:35.206]  Stand up and say, put us all on a list then.
[02:18:35.206 --> 02:18:41.430]  Because if they're... Hitler did this in the 30's, Stalin and Lenin did it, Mao did it, Pol Pot did it.
[02:18:41.430 --> 02:18:45.453]  If they're able to intimidate right up front and cow us, they're going to win.
[02:18:45.453 --> 02:18:46.594]  And folks, make no mistake,
[02:18:47.671 --> 02:18:55.301]  I mean, they have said they're going to conscript everybody 18-24 to be part of a new domestic military as big as the regular military.
[02:18:55.301 --> 02:18:59.507]  And, you know, here is the bill number, ladies and gentlemen, in the House.
[02:18:59.507 --> 02:19:03.091]  It's Generations Invigorating Voluntarism and Education Act.
[02:19:03.932 --> 02:19:07.554]  And it passed the House last week a whopping 321 to 105.
[02:19:07.554 --> 02:19:12.096]  So this sucker had more than 200 votes over what it needed.
[02:19:12.096 --> 02:19:14.157]  Just absolutely incredible.
[02:19:14.157 --> 02:19:24.561]  Under section 6104, under duties in subsection B6, it says mandatory service requirement for all abled young people being developed.
[02:19:24.561 --> 02:19:30.363]  And it goes, I mean, so they're setting up the federal agency under AmeriCorps called SecureCorps to force this.
[02:19:30.363 --> 02:19:30.664]  Also,
[02:19:31.844 --> 02:19:38.147]  It sets up a Clean Energy Corps, Education Corps, Health Futures Corps, and Veteran Service Corps.
[02:19:38.147 --> 02:19:45.570]  It extends the National Civilian Community Corps to focus on additional areas like disaster relief and energy conservation, and literal spying.
[02:19:45.570 --> 02:19:46.510]  Here's England.
[02:19:46.510 --> 02:19:49.992]  Civilian force of 60,000 trained as terrorist spotters.
[02:19:49.992 --> 02:19:51.932]  That's London Observer reporting that.
[02:19:51.932 --> 02:19:52.493]  Stay there, sir.
[02:19:52.493 --> 02:19:59.916]  I want to come back to you with Paul Watson, integrate all this together, and give the website out of your group so people can join your organization.
[02:19:59.916 --> 02:20:00.536]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:07.462]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:20:07.462 --> 02:20:08.242]  and the world.
[02:20:08.242 --> 02:20:12.123]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:20:12.123 --> 02:20:18.626]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:20:18.626 --> 02:20:20.646]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:20:20.646 --> 02:20:28.589]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:20:28.869 --> 02:20:33.571]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:20:33.571 --> 02:20:39.374]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:20:39.374 --> 02:20:41.555]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:20:41.555 --> 02:20:43.796]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:20:44.156 --> 02:20:45.237]  Free of charge.
[02:20:45.237 --> 02:20:45.577]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:45.577 --> 02:20:45.657]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:45.657 --> 02:20:47.197]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[02:20:47.197 --> 02:20:47.778]  Factory direct.
[02:20:47.778 --> 02:20:49.338]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:20:49.338 --> 02:20:49.719]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:20:49.719 --> 02:20:51.619]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[02:21:04.488 --> 02:21:07.112]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.112 --> 02:21:14.103]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:14.702 --> 02:21:21.268]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.268 --> 02:21:23.250]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:25.753]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:25.753 --> 02:21:36.563]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.336 --> 02:21:38.997]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:38.997 --> 02:21:40.859]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:47.764]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:47.764 --> 02:21:56.031]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.031 --> 02:21:57.612]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:57.612 --> 02:22:02.436]  The people strike back.
[02:22:02.436 --> 02:22:03.557]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:04.008 --> 02:22:10.050]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:22:10.050 --> 02:22:10.850]  That's right.
[02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:13.711]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:22:13.711 --> 02:22:21.193]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:22:21.193 --> 02:22:28.816]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:29.318 --> 02:22:34.800]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:40.622]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:40.622 --> 02:22:45.124]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:22:45.124 --> 02:22:45.404]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.404 --> 02:22:47.385]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:47.385 --> 02:22:47.985]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.985 --> 02:22:48.265]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.609 --> 02:23:04.130]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:23:04.130 --> 02:23:06.051]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:23:06.051 --> 02:23:11.613]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:23:11.613 --> 02:23:19.636]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:23:19.636 --> 02:23:28.939]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[02:23:29.219 --> 02:23:32.443]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.
[02:23:32.443 --> 02:23:37.629]  Renaissance Charge offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and sizes of batteries.
[02:23:37.629 --> 02:23:43.155]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.
[02:23:43.155 --> 02:23:43.836]  Save your money!
[02:23:44.256 --> 02:23:45.577]  Save the environment?
[02:23:45.577 --> 02:23:48.599]  Visit us online at r-charge.com.
[02:23:48.599 --> 02:23:50.821]  That's r-charge.com.
[02:23:50.821 --> 02:23:51.601]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[02:23:51.601 --> 02:23:52.061]  That's 989-637-4179.
[02:23:52.061 --> 02:23:53.382]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[02:24:26.482 --> 02:24:41.731]  Youth brigades, FEMA camps, bills to ban all semi-autos, open talk in mainstream news about martial law, the state police being taught that we're all basically criminals that love America.
[02:24:41.731 --> 02:24:43.752]  We got the documents, called the Army, confirmed it.
[02:24:43.752 --> 02:24:45.873]  We had our in-the-Fed protest in Dallas.
[02:24:45.873 --> 02:24:47.955]  The Army was watching us there as terrorists.
[02:24:49.093 --> 02:24:58.756]  This is what's going on, this is what's happening, this is the reality, and the House has passed a national draft, an expansive draft for women as well, for your children under federal control.
[02:24:58.756 --> 02:25:02.457]  They're taking over right now!
[02:25:02.457 --> 02:25:10.539]  In closing, going back to Ed Martin, spokesman for Missourians United for Life, give us your website, sir, tell folks how they can get involved.
[02:25:10.539 --> 02:25:16.921]  Now, you're right, the Governor's kind of giving a halfway apology to all of this.
[02:25:16.921 --> 02:25:18.141]  Tell us about your legal action.
[02:25:19.048 --> 02:25:29.771]  Yeah, what we've done is we filed a, uh, with the ACLU, we filed a complaint with them asking them to join us to go into federal court and get a TRO, Temporary Restraining Order.
[02:25:29.771 --> 02:25:36.774]  We also actually today are investigating whether the Missouri Human Rights Commission has jurisdiction and we'll consider that.
[02:25:36.774 --> 02:25:44.336]  And look, anything, as you said earlier, the one thing we cannot do is sit around and feel sorry for ourselves.
[02:25:44.336 --> 02:25:46.537]  I hate to quote Bill Clinton, but I will.
[02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:47.377]  He once said,
[02:25:47.799 --> 02:25:51.885]  The only thing that a bully understands is when you punch them in the mouth.
[02:25:51.885 --> 02:25:59.836]  My opinion is that we need to all stand up and realize we have a lot more to lose if we don't get our act together and push back.
[02:26:00.905 --> 02:26:01.786]  And that's what we're going to do.
[02:26:01.786 --> 02:26:12.113]  So we have a coalition of pro-life groups, Christian groups, anti-illegal immigration groups, gun NRA types that are all angry about this report.
[02:26:12.113 --> 02:26:17.857]  We are not going to stop until these people know that they're wrong and that people are watching them.
[02:26:17.857 --> 02:26:22.240]  So MissouriUnitedForLife.org is our website.
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:29.586]  MissouriUnitedForLife.org is a bunch of press releases there and people can get on an email list and join the fight here in Missouri and across the country.
[02:26:30.171 --> 02:26:36.576]  Well, it's clear they're trying to create a chilling effect, that I better not put a Ron Paul sticker or a Libertarian sticker or a pro-life sticker.
[02:26:36.576 --> 02:26:42.100]  We even had in Oklahoma where they took the guy's pro-life sign off his car and sent the Secret Service to his house.
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:47.384]  I've got mainstream news where Homeland Security's showing up at people's houses that have bought more than a thousand rounds of ammo.
[02:26:47.384 --> 02:26:48.745]  I mean, this is secret police.
[02:26:48.745 --> 02:26:51.927]  This is federalization being turned loose on us.
[02:26:51.927 --> 02:26:55.630]  The good news is the military and police themselves are very upset by all this.
[02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:58.072]  That's why I'm being given all these secret documents.
[02:26:58.072 --> 02:26:59.393]  You know, we got the MIAC report.
[02:27:00.339 --> 02:27:01.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:11.713]  I think that's one of the things that we have to count on is that we have to try to realize that there are good men and women inside the state police and other places who will recognize.
[02:27:11.713 --> 02:27:18.042]  But what's happening is that the federal government, the state government, state law enforcement are rooting out those people whenever they can.
[02:27:18.595 --> 02:27:18.875]  I don't know.
[02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:36.607]  You're on the watch list already.
[02:27:58.518 --> 02:28:01.299]  You know who should be on the watch list?
[02:28:01.299 --> 02:28:12.762]  Who should be on the watch list are the private banks, like the Federal Reserve, that go before the Senate and say, we won't tell you where the trillions of dollars have gone.
[02:28:12.762 --> 02:28:20.644]  These are the un-American groups bringing our country down, and it is just absolutely amazing that this is happening.
[02:28:20.644 --> 02:28:24.925]  How angry has this made pro-life groups to be listed in there in Missouri?
[02:28:25.854 --> 02:28:30.408]  Well, it certainly got people fired up, but again, one of the things that we can use these moments to point out that, hey,
[02:28:30.737 --> 02:28:35.380]  Now, this isn't the only effort by the federal government to take control of our lives.
[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:41.344]  You know, there's federal legislation that would usurp all state limits on pro-life issues, on abortion.
[02:28:41.344 --> 02:28:44.886]  That's the FOCA bill, poorly named Freedom of Choice Act.
[02:28:44.886 --> 02:28:50.489]  But what we're finding is people are almost confused by it because they're just like, what?
[02:28:50.489 --> 02:28:51.290]  What houses?
[02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:57.754]  And we need to channel their focus to how wrong this is and how we have to act.
[02:28:58.374 --> 02:29:07.799]  There is a sense, you know, and you were a great service on this and others that have picked it up, that it's starting to get to people's understanding of what exactly has gone on.
[02:29:07.799 --> 02:29:13.362]  But, you know, the problem is we're fighting this fight together, you and I, shoulder to shoulder.
[02:29:13.362 --> 02:29:17.905]  There's other stuff that's going on, similar kinds of devious things that we're not catching.
[02:29:17.905 --> 02:29:21.747]  We don't have time, or as you said, it's happening so fast my head is spinning.
[02:29:21.747 --> 02:29:26.930]  And, you know, this is what's happening in America and we're losing control of our country.
[02:29:28.513 --> 02:29:29.254]  Absolutely.
[02:29:29.254 --> 02:29:34.418]  I really appreciate you being on the show today, sir.
[02:29:34.418 --> 02:29:37.001]  And we're just all in this together.
[02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:38.102]  We all hang together.
[02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:39.683]  We all hang separate.
[02:29:39.683 --> 02:29:46.229]  And we appreciate Ed Martin, spokesman for the Missouri United for Life, MissouriansUnitedforLife.com for coming on.
[02:29:46.229 --> 02:29:51.894]  Paul Watson is straight ahead with the national draft for you and your family.
[02:29:51.894 --> 02:29:53.275]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.275 --> 02:29:54.777]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.786 --> 02:30:01.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.829 --> 02:30:03.810]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:30:03.810 --> 02:30:10.773]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:30:10.773 --> 02:30:19.177]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:19.177 --> 02:30:24.900]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:25.060 --> 02:30:26.902]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:26.902 --> 02:30:29.085]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:29.085 --> 02:30:33.631]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:30:33.631 --> 02:30:35.853]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:30:35.853 --> 02:30:43.723]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:31:02.067 --> 02:31:07.308]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.112 --> 02:31:13.977]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.977 --> 02:31:20.481]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.481 --> 02:31:22.463]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.463 --> 02:31:24.925]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:31:24.925 --> 02:31:35.813]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:39.763]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.763 --> 02:31:41.624]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.624 --> 02:31:48.550]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.797 --> 02:31:58.379]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.379 --> 02:31:59.580]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.328 --> 02:32:03.610]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[02:32:03.610 --> 02:32:05.771]  It's time to think outside the box.
[02:32:05.771 --> 02:32:07.733]  How about starting your own garden?
[02:32:07.733 --> 02:32:09.994]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.

[02:33:26.650 --> 02:33:30.034]  Normally I'm so deep into fighting the New World Order that I don't let it get to me.
[02:33:30.034 --> 02:33:35.441]  And it's always in the late hours of the evening that it really upsets me.
[02:33:35.441 --> 02:33:36.903]  And shakes me.
[02:33:36.903 --> 02:33:37.424]  But...
[02:33:45.765 --> 02:33:53.793]  Folks, they are setting up the most hardcore tyranny ever seen, integrating the Nazis, the Soviets, all of their systems.
[02:33:53.793 --> 02:33:57.477]  Youth brigades, forced drafts, tattletale squads.
[02:33:57.477 --> 02:33:58.518]  It has passed the House.
[02:33:58.518 --> 02:34:01.681]  We're still trying to confirm if it's passed the Senate.
[02:34:01.681 --> 02:34:03.483]  AP reports they're debating it.
[02:34:04.383 --> 02:34:05.765]  We don't have a headline yet.
[02:34:05.765 --> 02:34:07.006]  They call it AmeriCorps.
[02:34:07.006 --> 02:34:09.649]  Expanding National Service in the New York Times.
[02:34:09.649 --> 02:34:14.154]  The AP calls it Senate set to vote on expansion of AmeriCorps.
[02:34:14.154 --> 02:34:17.238]  But I have the bill here in front of me.
[02:34:17.238 --> 02:34:20.261]  Generations Invigorating Voluntarism and Education Act.
[02:34:20.261 --> 02:34:21.643]  It's a slightly different name in the Senate.
[02:34:23.621 --> 02:34:34.045]  And it is drafting into federal programs middle schoolers, high schoolers, and then three months to start out of the year 18 to 24 for military training.
[02:34:34.045 --> 02:34:37.806]  What we cover in the Obama deception.
[02:34:37.806 --> 02:34:43.469]  This guy's in office two months and they've already basically got the sucker passed.
[02:34:43.469 --> 02:34:44.509]  Let's bring Paul Watson up.
[02:34:44.509 --> 02:34:50.611]  I called him up, freaked out 30 minutes ago, told him to look and we've been scrambling here trying to find it during the breaks.
[02:34:50.611 --> 02:34:52.052]  Paul, has it passed the Senate?
[02:34:54.372 --> 02:34:56.172]  I don't believe it's passed yet, Alex.
[02:34:56.172 --> 02:35:09.955]  There's a New York Times article, editorial actually this morning, lauding the virtues of it and saying that once the Senate passes it, it can be allied with some of the other similar proposals.
[02:35:09.955 --> 02:35:13.276]  So I don't think, I don't believe it's passed the Senate yet.
[02:35:13.276 --> 02:35:15.497]  I'm trying to look at the moment.
[02:35:15.497 --> 02:35:17.177]  Well, regardless, it's passed the House.
[02:35:19.031 --> 02:35:21.774]  And I've read the AP and this, and they don't say the name of the bill.
[02:35:21.774 --> 02:35:23.736]  The caller said the name, but we didn't write it down.
[02:35:23.736 --> 02:35:28.160]  What is the name of the Senate version?
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:31.003]  Well, it'll be the same as the House bill.
[02:35:31.003 --> 02:35:32.525]  No, it has a slightly different one.
[02:35:32.525 --> 02:35:34.647]  Well, we need to find out right now.
[02:35:34.647 --> 02:35:36.428]  You know what?
[02:35:36.428 --> 02:35:37.329]  This is too important.
[02:35:37.329 --> 02:35:39.512]  I'm just going to suspend the broadcast right now.
[02:35:39.512 --> 02:35:41.313]  We'll go to music until I get on a computer.
[02:35:41.313 --> 02:35:42.615]  I can find this in five minutes.
[02:35:43.922 --> 02:36:00.209]  Paul, you know what, you start going over your article from last Thursday, House Passes Mandatory National Service Bill, then that dovetails with your other article, Defense Department Announces Civilian Expeditionary Workforce, then it says for domestically or internationally a total force.
[02:36:01.547 --> 02:36:05.709]  Yeah, I think the Senate one is called the Serve America Act, but that's not identical to the Give Act.
[02:36:29.068 --> 02:36:49.272]  I'm trying to look now, obviously my internet connection has died at this exact moment, but yeah, the one we reported on last week was the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, known as the GIVE Act, which was passed by 321 to 105 margin in the House.
[02:36:49.272 --> 02:36:57.474]  And in the, uh, under section 6104, under a section called Duties, it says that
[02:36:58.075 --> 02:37:19.909]  Quote, whether a workable, fair, reasonable, mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic, ethnic and educational backgrounds.
[02:37:19.909 --> 02:37:27.114]  And then there was another section which is called Youth Engagement Zone Program, which is similar to what the
[02:37:28.072 --> 02:37:45.278]  Then a version of a similar bill says, which talks about, quote, service learning, which will be, quote, a mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency.
[02:37:45.278 --> 02:37:56.842]  And as he said, with the Defence Department version, which is for Defence Department employees for foreign missions, states that
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:11.912]  Quote, management retains the authority to direct and assign civilian employees either voluntarily, involuntarily, or on an unexpected basis to accomplish the DoD mission.
[02:38:11.912 --> 02:38:22.200]  So it's saying that basically, even if it's involuntary, DoD civilian employees will be forced to support
[02:38:22.887 --> 02:38:24.648]  Military missions abroad.
[02:38:24.648 --> 02:38:31.473]  And I'll tell you, they'll only get the fake patriotism they need to ram this through with staged terror attacks or a new war.
[02:38:31.473 --> 02:38:38.738]  Understanding how they operate, this is so unpopular, they're only going to get this with a staged terror attack.
[02:38:38.738 --> 02:38:44.242]  Well, Beden promised that there would be a national crisis within, what, the first few months, so...
[02:38:45.538 --> 02:38:50.520]  It's happened with every other president, basically, so we should expect it to happen with Obama.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:53.522]  Well, it's passed the House, and I'm on the Senate website.
[02:38:53.522 --> 02:38:57.583]  It says they're debating it right now.
[02:38:57.583 --> 02:39:14.591]  Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, said in the Financial News Wire, he says, the Serve America Act, Reid said, will provide better opportunities for Americans of all ages, for all regions and walks of life, to answer the call to service.
[02:39:15.936 --> 02:39:20.817]  And it goes on, it is forced service.
[02:39:20.817 --> 02:39:26.818]  And you know, I mean it's just hitting me the last few days, this is crazy!
[02:39:26.818 --> 02:39:35.640]  This isn't just a draft where they send 18 to 21 year olds to Vietnam and there's a lottery and all the rich people don't have to go.
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:36.880]  This is for girls!
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:41.001]  This is grabbing them and making them be under federal service when they're in middle school!
[02:39:42.101 --> 02:40:00.107]  7th and 8th grade, this is in high school, and then this is serving at military camps, training, in defense training, for 18 to 24, and then they have all these other corps, and they say it's mandatory, the chief of staff says it's mandatory, and do you see any of the supposed liberal websites talking about this?
[02:40:00.107 --> 02:40:01.787]  Do you see conservative websites?
[02:40:01.787 --> 02:40:02.067]  No!
[02:40:02.067 --> 02:40:06.909]  I see almost no one talking about this, Paul, that's what freaks me out!
[02:40:07.569 --> 02:40:10.090]  We put out, like, the first article on this Thursday.
[02:40:10.090 --> 02:40:13.250]  We've been warning people they were getting ready for it.
[02:40:13.250 --> 02:40:16.851]  And then no one's even covering it!
[02:40:16.851 --> 02:40:18.952]  Well, the New York Times is certainly covering it.
[02:40:18.952 --> 02:40:20.892]  Yeah, yeah, they're covering it, saying it's good.
[02:40:20.892 --> 02:40:21.493]  Exactly.
[02:40:21.493 --> 02:40:24.333]  All I'm seeing is positive reportage.
[02:40:24.333 --> 02:40:34.056]  They say, in an editorial, quote, This is a chance to constructively harness the idealism of thousands of Americans eager to contribute time and energy to solving the nation's problems.
[02:40:34.056 --> 02:40:35.136]  A chance not to be missed.
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:39.225]  Let's push in the fact that the Senate needs to pass it.
[02:40:39.225 --> 02:40:46.196]  And whenever the New York Times and the Washington Post get behind something, then you know it's coming from the very top.
[02:40:47.864 --> 02:40:49.264]  Well, I mean, here we are.
[02:40:49.264 --> 02:40:51.605]  It is a national draft for everyone.
[02:40:51.605 --> 02:40:58.347]  They admit it's military training, and then all these other little tattletale brigades in England's announced.
[02:40:58.347 --> 02:41:01.128]  Open spies watching all the citizens right out of East Germany.
[02:41:01.128 --> 02:41:02.128]  Tell folks about that.
[02:41:02.128 --> 02:41:03.709]  It's happening in Australia.
[02:41:03.709 --> 02:41:04.649]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:41:04.649 --> 02:41:09.231]  They're just announcing it everywhere.
[02:41:09.231 --> 02:41:17.033]  The British government, including Gordon Brown himself, they're very proud of it, came out on Sunday and said that
[02:41:17.970 --> 02:41:40.054]  Tens of thousands, the figure is around 60,000 British civilians, and we're talking managers of supermarkets and people like that, people who work in stores, have been trained to spot, quote, terrorists and then report them to an authority.
[02:41:40.054 --> 02:41:44.395]  And we knew, we knew this was already going on.
[02:41:44.395 --> 02:41:45.475]  We knew that this was already
[02:41:46.607 --> 02:41:46.767]  Yeah.
[02:42:16.088 --> 02:42:20.710]  There are no real terrorists running around like, you know, they tell us there are.
[02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:42.898]  So, the only people caught up in it are, for example, there's a story today which I posted out of the Telegraph, I think, which was about two fishermen who use laser pointers to prevent ducks from becoming entangled in their fishing nets, and for pointing these lasers at these ducks to prevent them from getting caught in the nets.
[02:42:43.615 --> 02:42:53.343]  They were arrested by police under the Terrorism Act because pointing lasers is now an act of terrorism and they were actually interrogated for hours.
[02:42:53.343 --> 02:42:53.863]  Exactly!
[02:42:53.863 --> 02:42:58.667]  We can't explain how bad it is because we live this and see hundreds of things a day.
[02:42:58.667 --> 02:43:03.971]  Paul, they're arresting people for dropping an apple core by accident off of a table at a cafe.
[02:43:03.971 --> 02:43:11.918]  They are arresting, they may be legal to photograph or videotape police, but they have millions of cameras in London alone videotaping us.
[02:43:15.343 --> 02:43:17.964]  It's all off the charts, and it's happening in the U.S.
[02:43:17.964 --> 02:43:18.264]  as well.
[02:43:18.264 --> 02:43:18.725]  Listen to this.
[02:43:18.725 --> 02:43:21.446]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a story March 24th.
[02:43:21.446 --> 02:43:25.669]  Give mandatory service act strips first amendment from volunteers.
[02:43:25.669 --> 02:43:36.014]  He went and read, it's from governmenttrack.us, and it says George Miller, a Democrat, and this passed the House, tacked an amendment on H.R.
[02:43:36.014 --> 02:43:41.818]  1388, that's the one that's passed, entitled Generations Invigorating Volunteerism Act, to give government
[02:43:42.901 --> 02:43:46.142]  Obama's plan to require mandatory service for all able young people.
[02:43:46.142 --> 02:43:56.384]  Miller's amendment will prohibit organizations from attempting to influence legislation, organize or engage in protests, petitions, boycotts, or strikes, and assist, promote, or deter union organizing.
[02:43:56.384 --> 02:43:58.524]  So they also gag everybody.
[02:43:58.524 --> 02:44:00.304]  I mean, my God!
[02:44:00.304 --> 02:44:08.046]  In other words, Obama's Volunteer Corps Act passed by the House with a 321 to 105 margin and requiring the government to develop a plan for
[02:44:09.286 --> 02:44:17.593]  Indentured servitude would deny millions of people the right to oppose and organize against government legislation of the First Amendment.
[02:44:17.593 --> 02:44:23.818]  This is close to a Sedition Act, a violation of the First Amendment rights, and has been proposed in recent history.
[02:44:23.818 --> 02:44:27.901]  A basic right, as part of our natural and amiable rights, is to resist government.
[02:44:27.901 --> 02:44:29.022]  Our founders not only knew
[02:44:30.023 --> 02:44:31.765]  That this was a right, but a responsibility.
[02:44:31.765 --> 02:44:37.629]  This legislation begins to break down this significantly, writes Gary Wood in the Examiner in England.
[02:44:37.629 --> 02:44:39.691]  So there is an article out of England on this.
[02:44:39.691 --> 02:44:41.513]  Paul, this is insane!
[02:44:41.513 --> 02:44:43.074]  This is insane!
[02:44:43.074 --> 02:44:46.457]  Gagging all the young people, bringing them into brigades.
[02:44:46.957 --> 02:44:47.777]  Well, exactly.
[02:44:47.777 --> 02:44:48.098]  I mean...
[02:45:11.425 --> 02:45:18.868]  Obama said that it was his aim to cut carbon emissions by 80%.
[02:45:18.868 --> 02:45:25.330]  You just had Gordon Brown's head environmental minister say that they've got to reduce the UK population forcibly by 50%.
[02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:31.853]  They've got to have water rationing, food rationing, that's the timing.
[02:45:31.853 --> 02:45:32.793]  You just can't!
[02:45:32.793 --> 02:45:35.054]  These are criminals taking over!
[02:45:35.054 --> 02:45:38.315]  It isn't enough that they've ruled everything and sucked everything out with the banks.
[02:45:39.719 --> 02:45:40.819]  I am pissed, man.
[02:45:40.819 --> 02:45:43.540]  You know, because... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:49.061]  The thing about it, Alex, is that the next step for America is what we've got in the UK.
[02:45:49.061 --> 02:45:57.002]  Because, for example, in America, you've got this Obama army of knocker door zombies, you know, knocking on a million doors.
[02:45:57.002 --> 02:45:58.743]  That's proven completely pathetic.
[02:45:58.743 --> 02:46:00.223]  It was a total failure.
[02:46:00.223 --> 02:46:03.744]  But in England, this is where it really gets serious.
[02:46:03.744 --> 02:46:04.564]  They've actually got
[02:46:05.103 --> 02:46:12.006]  People who are recruited into a charity that has links to the government that masquerades as a charity.
[02:46:12.006 --> 02:46:13.987]  It's called Common Purpose.
[02:46:13.987 --> 02:46:26.153]  And this is where the people who are later appointed to positions of power within each city are fed the government line on how the city needs to be run and they're assigned positions of power.
[02:46:26.153 --> 02:46:33.316]  And I just checked on my own city on who were members of this Common Purpose organisation and literally
[02:46:33.946 --> 02:46:56.237]  Every university, every police department, every branch of media and local government are infested with these common purpose members who have been recruited by this secret organisation which, by the way, has its origins in a Marxist think tank from which Tony Blair got his political ideology.
[02:46:56.641 --> 02:46:56.821]  Yeah.
[02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:18.546]  And then they're merging it with this common purpose, and then literally, they're also the community leaders.
[02:47:18.546 --> 02:47:24.050]  Then you cross-reference it, they're also part of the spy group, spying on everyone at every level.
[02:47:24.050 --> 02:47:30.675]  That's what Obama's doing, and this is literally what the Nazis, the East Germans, and the Soviets, and the Communist Chinese did.
[02:47:30.675 --> 02:47:33.377]  They are following the exact pattern.
[02:47:33.377 --> 02:47:38.040]  It is happening now, and I had an article in here from the Associated Press, I can't find it now.
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:39.582]  It's somewhere here in my crazy stack.
[02:47:40.498 --> 02:48:08.331]  that actually, zoom in on this folks, this is just the stack of the last two days, I can't even keep track of it, tilt that camera, I want folks to see on PrisonPlanet.TV what we're dealing with, where the new 29-year-old head of the state police in Illinois is a former military captain, and then I see this, they're now moving army officers out to be the heads of state police, police chiefs everywhere, the military takeover is happening right now!
[02:48:10.367 --> 02:48:12.368]  I mean, it's happening, okay, folks?
[02:48:12.368 --> 02:48:13.648]  America is falling!
[02:48:13.648 --> 02:48:15.169]  The Republic is falling!
[02:48:15.169 --> 02:48:22.771]  I've got mainstream news articles here where the Supreme Court today is hearing whether they're going to ban any movies or documentaries criticizing the government.
[02:48:22.771 --> 02:48:24.892]  Associated Press, Paul.
[02:48:24.892 --> 02:48:26.192]  Associated Press, Paul.
[02:48:26.192 --> 02:48:31.674]  I mean... Yeah, it's regarding the Hillary Clinton documentary, isn't it?
[02:48:31.674 --> 02:48:38.396]  Yes, I mean, the AP with a straight face acts like it's normal that they're considering banning criticizing government.
[02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:42.350]  Claiming it's a violation of campaign finance laws.
[02:48:42.350 --> 02:48:48.433]  And we told people the way Russ Feingold was written in 2002, that it could end free speech the way it was written.
[02:48:48.433 --> 02:48:50.054]  Now they're implementing it!
[02:48:50.054 --> 02:48:54.536]  See, they're going to pass the draft through the Senate, and they're going to slowly... People are like, well, where's the draft?
[02:48:54.536 --> 02:48:54.976]  Where's it at?
[02:48:54.976 --> 02:48:56.277]  And then it'll phase in.
[02:48:56.277 --> 02:48:58.418]  But you've heard people calling, and it's in the news.
[02:48:58.418 --> 02:49:03.581]  They're already telling high schoolers, oh, you've got to do compulsory federal service now, and it's not even a law!
[02:49:03.581 --> 02:49:06.962]  They're just criminals!
[02:49:06.962 --> 02:49:08.483]  A serious thing related to...
[02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:10.545]  But he said it's only for a little while.
[02:49:39.551 --> 02:49:43.672]  So the Feds take over, and then we had a caller earlier about how it's happening in Las Vegas.
[02:49:43.672 --> 02:49:45.633]  I mean, it is insane.
[02:49:45.633 --> 02:49:51.094]  And they're doing it so they can steal all your pension funds that you've been investing in for 30 years.
[02:49:51.094 --> 02:49:58.056]  And the prefect is going to be this, quote, summer of rage, which is all coming from the media.
[02:49:58.056 --> 02:50:03.437]  And now we've caught the Ford Foundation and everybody else funding the riot groups.
[02:50:03.437 --> 02:50:08.859]  Yeah, and the big flashpoint for that, or one of the big flashpoints, is going to be April 2nd in London.
[02:50:09.522 --> 02:50:12.979]  With the G20 meeting and that's where the saying is.
[02:50:13.647 --> 02:50:18.268]  There's going to be a lot of riots, there's going to be a big police clampdown, and that's exactly what they want.
[02:50:18.268 --> 02:50:37.253]  And they're announcing at the G20, they're going to openly, they've already announced, they're going to officially say World Government Bank that controls the whole planet, as Newsweek and Time have said, totally ruling everyone, and instead of covering what they're doing, the news is going to cover the hired thugs they bring, and we've caught them in Denver last year, Denver Post, police staging as anarchists.
[02:50:37.253 --> 02:50:39.174]  My God, it's a vortex of evil.
[02:50:39.594 --> 02:50:40.855]  And they want your bank accounts.
[02:50:40.855 --> 02:50:41.795]  They want your children.
[02:50:41.795 --> 02:50:43.296]  They want you to be indentured servants.
[02:50:43.296 --> 02:50:44.037]  This is it.
[02:50:44.037 --> 02:50:45.818]  They're launching attacks at every level.
[02:50:45.818 --> 02:50:46.938]  You've got to wake up.
[02:50:46.938 --> 02:50:50.541]  You've got to get the Obama deception on DVD and get it out to everybody.
[02:50:50.541 --> 02:50:52.882]  They're openly announcing they want to shut down the web.
[02:50:52.882 --> 02:50:54.883]  Jay Rockefeller, it's openly happening.
[02:50:54.883 --> 02:50:56.504]  This is the time to be awake.
[02:50:56.504 --> 02:50:57.805]  This is the time to be involved.
[02:50:57.805 --> 02:50:59.986]  Paul Watson, stay with us!
[02:51:01.690 --> 02:51:12.260]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:13.681]  Garden in a Can!
[02:51:13.681 --> 02:51:17.825]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[02:51:17.825 --> 02:51:19.847]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.

[02:51:32.277 --> 02:51:33.698]  Garden in a can.
[02:51:33.698 --> 02:51:34.899]  It's that simple.
[02:51:34.899 --> 02:51:35.619]  Fresh.
[02:51:35.619 --> 02:51:36.480]  Healthy.
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:37.301]  Easy.
[02:51:37.301 --> 02:51:41.644]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[02:51:51.908 --> 02:51:55.350]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:06.937 --> 02:52:14.503]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:14.503 --> 02:52:21.088]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.088 --> 02:52:23.070]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:25.572]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:25.572 --> 02:52:36.541]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.142 --> 02:52:38.802]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:38.802 --> 02:52:40.663]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:40.663 --> 02:52:47.585]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:55.847 --> 02:52:57.408]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:57.408 --> 02:52:58.608]  The people strike back.
[02:53:00.746 --> 02:53:04.189]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:53:04.189 --> 02:53:08.453]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:53:08.453 --> 02:53:16.421]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[02:53:16.681 --> 02:53:17.121]  We're good to go!
[02:53:46.152 --> 02:53:46.412]  We're good.
[02:54:04.881 --> 02:54:06.483]  Folks, we have all the intelligence.
[02:54:06.483 --> 02:54:07.464]  We have the documents.
[02:54:07.464 --> 02:54:08.565]  We know the battle plan.
[02:54:08.565 --> 02:54:09.767]  It's all admitted.
[02:54:09.767 --> 02:54:11.269]  Total takeover of America.
[02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:12.350]  Secret police everywhere.
[02:54:12.350 --> 02:54:13.331]  Youth brigades.
[02:54:13.331 --> 02:54:15.694]  Military taking over all the police departments.
[02:54:15.694 --> 02:54:16.495]  Total evil.
[02:54:16.495 --> 02:54:19.979]  So they can steal all the bank accounts, everything, and make us third world slaves.
[02:54:19.979 --> 02:54:21.681]  We're being... We're being looted.
[02:54:21.681 --> 02:54:22.121]  We're being...
[02:54:23.522 --> 02:54:24.924]  Literally mugged right now.
[02:54:24.924 --> 02:54:27.967]  This is what the international bankers have done all over the planet.
[02:54:27.967 --> 02:54:29.809]  It's happening here.
[02:54:29.809 --> 02:54:31.672]  It's happening in England.
[02:54:31.672 --> 02:54:33.033]  It's classical tyranny.
[02:54:33.033 --> 02:54:34.074]  These are criminals.
[02:54:34.074 --> 02:54:36.737]  These are hardcore control freaks.
[02:54:36.737 --> 02:54:39.160]  Paul Watson, we need a headline that explains it.
[02:54:40.161 --> 02:54:42.783]  Giant national draft for all Americans.
[02:54:42.783 --> 02:54:44.724]  Slavery about to pass Senate.
[02:54:44.724 --> 02:54:46.404]  You need to throw the kitchen sink at them.
[02:54:46.404 --> 02:54:52.287]  Show them the Army documents, the Army public memorandums where they're saying forced service.
[02:54:52.287 --> 02:54:53.668]  We need the Rahm Emanuel clips.
[02:54:53.668 --> 02:54:56.229]  We need the clips of
[02:54:57.370 --> 02:54:59.991]  Obama's saying it, Emanuel's saying it on C-SPAN.
[02:54:59.991 --> 02:55:03.093]  I mean, folks, this is slavery!
[02:55:03.093 --> 02:55:10.016]  This is... it's not enough to steal your bank accounts and devalue the dollar and bring in New World Order and have the bankers loot everything.
[02:55:10.016 --> 02:55:16.739]  And we go out and protest the Federal Reserve peacefully in Dallas with Ron Paul's brother and the Army documents.
[02:55:16.739 --> 02:55:17.540]  We call the Army.
[02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:19.040]  They admit it's their documents.
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:20.281]  They won't come on the air.
[02:55:20.281 --> 02:55:25.183]  The Army calling us terrorists and telling their military in plain clothes to look out.
[02:55:25.183 --> 02:55:26.144]  We may try to kill them.
[02:55:26.804 --> 02:55:34.568]  I mean, do you understand this is secret police telling the military we're terrorists because we're protesting the bastard bankers?
[02:55:34.568 --> 02:55:35.869]  People need to be more angry.
[02:55:35.869 --> 02:55:45.734]  You know, I get conditioned to all this and become accepting of it as I cover it just because it becomes normalized, but then all the time it just hits me when I blow up how insane this is!
[02:55:46.474 --> 02:55:48.215]  We've got to arrest all these bankers.
[02:55:48.215 --> 02:55:52.096]  We've got to have grand juries indict them, as Ron Paul said two weeks ago here.
[02:55:52.096 --> 02:55:58.478]  We have got to get aggressive with these criminals or they're going to kick our butts and they're going to set up death camps.
[02:55:58.478 --> 02:56:01.619]  The globalists are running this, folks, and they kill people everywhere they go.
[02:56:01.619 --> 02:56:02.639]  They killed 1,300,000 Iraqis.
[02:56:02.639 --> 02:56:03.280]  They aren't pleased.
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:05.360]  We're playing games.
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:09.522]  And if you think they care about you any more than they care about the Iraqis, you've got another thing coming.
[02:56:09.522 --> 02:56:15.244]  And they've got their liberal fake messiah with all these idiots following them, all these lazy stupid nobodies.
[02:56:15.244 --> 02:56:17.345]  They're going to love all the power they're being given.
[02:56:17.345 --> 02:56:18.705]  We're in a red-level crisis.
[02:56:18.705 --> 02:56:22.486]  They're federalizing high schools everywhere, turning them into military schools.
[02:56:22.486 --> 02:56:25.227]  Paul Watson, I know I'm ranting, but we should be ranting.
[02:56:25.227 --> 02:56:26.648]  My God, I'm sick of this!
[02:56:28.439 --> 02:56:31.161]  Alex, it passed the Senate last night.
[02:56:31.161 --> 02:56:34.504]  I mean, there's been so little coverage of it, we didn't even see it.
[02:56:34.504 --> 02:56:37.947]  The headline is, National Service Corps Bill Clears Senate Hurdle.
[02:56:37.947 --> 02:56:40.449]  It's the New York Times, 74 to 14, cleared last night.
[02:56:54.745 --> 02:56:56.666]  Oh God, they're going to do every... You know why I freak out?
[02:56:56.666 --> 02:56:59.107]  Because I keep thinking we're going to stop them, we're going to back them off.
[02:56:59.107 --> 02:57:00.928]  Folks, they're going to do it all.
[02:57:00.928 --> 02:57:02.869]  They're going to stage terror attacks next.
[02:57:02.869 --> 02:57:04.690]  They're going to launch new wars next.
[02:57:04.690 --> 02:57:09.793]  Paul, this is... They're going for... The gun confiscation's coming, folks.
[02:57:09.793 --> 02:57:12.354]  They're coming for your guns, Paul!
[02:57:12.354 --> 02:57:15.416]  Read me the article.
[02:57:15.416 --> 02:57:18.938]  It's National Service Corps Bill Clears Senate Hurdle.
[02:57:19.682 --> 02:57:21.102]  By Kate Phillips, New York Times.
[02:57:21.102 --> 02:57:22.283]  It's the same bill, it's the Give Act.
[02:57:22.283 --> 02:57:22.403]  H.R.
[02:57:22.403 --> 02:57:22.523]  1388.
[02:57:22.523 --> 02:57:23.763]  It's 1388, the Give Act, yeah.
[02:57:23.763 --> 02:57:24.423]  It's the same version.
[02:57:50.083 --> 02:57:53.784]  They have reinstituted slavery that ended in the 1860s.
[02:57:53.784 --> 02:57:57.225]  This is not a draft, this is slavery.
[02:57:57.225 --> 02:58:01.706]  Senate and House passed a new slavery bill, and that's what it is!
[02:58:01.706 --> 02:58:05.567]  And don't you dare email me and tell me I'm exaggerating or that isn't what it is.
[02:58:05.567 --> 02:58:07.827]  I know exactly what it is!
[02:58:07.827 --> 02:58:15.589]  And you'll never get my children, you'll never get my family, and I'm not going to serve the government anymore, you suck it off off of us, you parasite criminals!
[02:58:16.809 --> 02:58:17.970]  Cancel the next guest!
[02:58:17.970 --> 02:58:20.351]  I know she's important about the abuses of prisoners and everything.
[02:58:20.351 --> 02:58:24.173]  I'll have to move her again, because this is too important.
[02:58:24.173 --> 02:58:25.114]  Stay there, Watson!
[02:58:25.114 --> 02:58:31.118]  Stay there!
[02:58:31.118 --> 02:58:33.999]  Man, I am just... I can't even continue this transmission.
[02:58:33.999 --> 02:58:36.081]  This is so un-American!
[02:58:36.081 --> 02:58:37.341]  This is so evil!
[02:58:37.341 --> 02:58:43.025]  And now they're gonna stage terror attacks and come for our guns!
[02:58:43.025 --> 02:58:44.726]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:58:53.109 --> 02:58:57.851]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.851 --> 02:59:00.813]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.813 --> 02:59:03.854]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.854 --> 02:59:08.557]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.797 --> 02:59:09.919]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.919 --> 02:59:13.163]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.163 --> 02:59:20.173]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.173 --> 02:59:23.437]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:59:40.594 --> 02:59:42.416]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.235 --> 02:59:56.616]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.616 --> 03:00:08.221]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.221 --> 03:00:10.442]  Why am I so upset?
[03:00:10.442 --> 03:00:22.288]  Because this, everything that happens daily only confirms it is the worst, most virulent strain of tyranny that we have ever faced in the United States or worldwide.
[03:00:23.368 --> 03:00:24.609]  They are going to go for broke.
[03:00:24.609 --> 03:00:25.669]  They are going to do everything.
[03:00:25.669 --> 03:00:36.774]  The gun confiscation, the FEMA camps, the troops are already... They're appointing 29 and 32 year old army captains and colonels to take over the state police from Illinois to you name it.
[03:00:36.774 --> 03:00:38.615]  They're pulling out all the old state police.
[03:00:39.695 --> 03:00:52.805]  Uh, commanders, they're putting in New World Order people, they're federalizing everything, my God, a full-bore New World Order coup d'etat against the people of the United States, and it's happening in every other major western nation.
[03:00:52.805 --> 03:00:54.686]  The republics are falling.
[03:00:54.686 --> 03:00:59.370]  The last vestiges of the old republic are being swept away right now.
[03:01:02.987 --> 03:01:08.029]  And you don't send your children, even if they're homeschooled, they're going to claim they've got a report to federal duty.
[03:01:08.029 --> 03:01:11.230]  In middle school, they will send the CPS to kidnap them.
[03:01:11.230 --> 03:01:13.751]  If they don't, they're moving with forced inoculations.
[03:01:13.751 --> 03:01:15.792]  They're moving with bills to ban gardens.
[03:01:15.792 --> 03:01:25.196]  Literally, in mainstream news, suddenly mayors and city council people are saying we can't let people have gardens without police inspections because he might grow marijuana.
[03:01:25.196 --> 03:01:26.276]  I mean, just hard
[03:01:26.556 --> 03:01:35.647]  Core super tyranny is upon us and the good news is people are waking up to it, but they're not waking up to just how hardcore it is.
[03:01:35.647 --> 03:01:38.510]  Paul, I want to let you go in a minute so you can go write an article.
[03:01:40.174 --> 03:01:41.195]  It is now past.
[03:01:41.195 --> 03:01:42.235]  It is now law.
[03:01:42.235 --> 03:01:43.696]  Mass total slavery.
[03:01:43.696 --> 03:01:44.496]  It is confirmed.
[03:01:44.496 --> 03:01:45.657]  Again, we're not omnipresent.
[03:01:45.657 --> 03:01:48.118]  That's why a caller alerted us an hour ago.
[03:01:48.118 --> 03:01:50.860]  In my gut, all I've been thinking about is this the last two days.
[03:01:50.860 --> 03:01:51.700]  I knew they were debating it.
[03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:53.341]  I've been sick at my stomach.
[03:01:53.341 --> 03:01:55.182]  I have been very upset.
[03:01:55.182 --> 03:02:00.325]  Because this is just so horrible to our precious republic that it's completely falling to this!
[03:02:03.636 --> 03:02:08.078]  You think I take pleasure in making films and doing all these radio shows and busting my butt?
[03:02:08.078 --> 03:02:11.719]  No, I'm doing it because I know these are hardcore killers taking control.
[03:02:11.719 --> 03:02:14.781]  And you idiots out there, George Bush would have done it if he could get away with it.
[03:02:14.781 --> 03:02:16.001]  He helped set it up.
[03:02:16.001 --> 03:02:16.881]  This is continual.
[03:02:16.881 --> 03:02:18.442]  It's the National Security Council.
[03:02:18.442 --> 03:02:20.083]  It's high treason!
[03:02:20.083 --> 03:02:22.364]  Everybody's got to go to their city councils and talk about this.
[03:02:22.364 --> 03:02:26.325]  Everybody's got to get in front of government and say, we're not going to be chilled by your intimidation.
[03:02:26.325 --> 03:02:27.526]  We're not going to be chilled by this.
[03:02:28.286 --> 03:02:35.532]  They want their Obama Army to create the illusion of grassroots support to go push this and bully cities, counties, and the Congress into whatever.
[03:02:35.532 --> 03:02:36.452]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:02:36.452 --> 03:02:41.697]  They made millions of phone calls to Congress this weekend to pass this and to pass all the rest of their stuff.
[03:02:41.697 --> 03:02:49.983]  And they're going to use those millions of people that will call and write and email as a false organic movement to ram through as a battering ram to destroy the Republic.
[03:02:49.983 --> 03:02:55.848]  You have to organically, the real Republic, speak out against this and say no and then not follow it.
[03:02:56.568 --> 03:03:05.294]  My God, pull your children out of government training camps, do whatever you, but see they're imploding the economy where you gotta take two, three jobs, then the school's there to have after hours to take your kids over.
[03:03:05.294 --> 03:03:08.956]  Paul Watson, I know I'm freaking out, but this is a normal response.
[03:03:08.956 --> 03:03:11.078]  I mean, here it is, New York Times.
[03:03:13.286 --> 03:03:16.447]  A National Service Corps bill clears Senate hurdle.
[03:03:16.447 --> 03:03:27.891]  Following overwhelming House passage last week, the Senate tonight voted 74 to 14 on a procedural move that essentially guarantees a major expansion of the National Service Corps, a cornerstone of volunteerism that dates back to the era of President Kennedy.
[03:03:27.891 --> 03:03:29.592]  Oh, it's old, it's good.
[03:03:29.592 --> 03:03:30.252]  It's akin to the
[03:03:31.092 --> 03:03:36.215]  To the call of arms by President Obama, oh it's akin to it, who has hearkened back to those days.
[03:03:36.215 --> 03:03:39.437]  This is not volunteerism like the Peace Corps, which is really CIA.
[03:03:39.437 --> 03:03:57.448]  This is, see they won't even tell people when they announce it what it is, but we've got the bill, forced compulsory service, and then we've got, then we've got the Pentagon Department of Defense announces civilian expeditionary force and says, forced conscription involuntary.
[03:03:57.448 --> 03:03:58.048]  Paul Watson.
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:05.242]  Alex, I don't know if Kurt mentioned this in his article, but it gets worse.
[03:04:05.242 --> 03:04:24.188]  12th Amendment to the Act, which is now being passed, reads, quote, Amendment to prohibit organizations from attempting to influence legislation, organize, or engage in protest, petitions, boycotts, or strikes, and assist, promote, or deter union organizing.
[03:04:24.673 --> 03:04:25.234]  Yeah.
[03:04:25.234 --> 03:04:25.974]  No, Kirk covered it.
[03:04:25.974 --> 03:04:29.898]  So they're only allowed to do the government's political actions they want.
[03:04:29.898 --> 03:04:37.504]  Obama's openly saying these groups are political and he's already launched it, but then selectively everybody else would be under conscription and then you can't.
[03:04:37.504 --> 03:04:41.548]  So, banning our free speech, only their propaganda.
[03:04:41.548 --> 03:04:43.890]  Finish up and we come back, Paul, I'm gonna let you go.
[03:04:43.890 --> 03:04:47.713]  We need a master article that explains it all to people historically.
[03:04:47.713 --> 03:04:49.395]  This is slavery.
[03:04:50.035 --> 03:04:53.438]  Senate and House passed National Slavery Bill.
[03:04:53.438 --> 03:04:55.761]  That is what it is.
[03:04:55.761 --> 03:04:59.204]  Red level emergency, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:59.204 --> 03:05:01.746]  What does this say about the Congress?
[03:05:01.746 --> 03:05:03.108]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:05:03.108 --> 03:05:05.510]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:09.674]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:05:09.674 --> 03:05:11.596]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[03:05:16.018 --> 03:05:16.818]  For the rest of you?
[03:05:45.302 --> 03:05:47.844]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:05:47.844 --> 03:05:51.867]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:06:15.265 --> 03:06:21.449]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.449 --> 03:06:23.810]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.810 --> 03:06:26.312]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.312 --> 03:06:37.899]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:37.899 --> 03:06:39.580]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.580 --> 03:06:40.941]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.425 --> 03:06:48.327]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:56.589 --> 03:06:58.170]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.170 --> 03:06:59.350]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.485 --> 03:07:05.006]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.006 --> 03:07:10.388]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.388 --> 03:07:15.550]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:15.550 --> 03:07:26.674]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:07:27.074 --> 03:07:32.856]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:32.856 --> 03:07:39.119]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:07:39.119 --> 03:07:40.159]  What about you?
[03:07:40.159 --> 03:07:46.582]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:08:10.404 --> 03:08:16.986]  What if you had a chance to stop Lenin, to stop Hitler, to stop Mao, to stop Pol Pot, to stop Fidel Castro, would you do it?
[03:08:19.704 --> 03:08:20.705]  We know how to beat them.
[03:08:20.705 --> 03:08:28.368]  Shattering the left-right paradigm, pointing out that it's a seamless police state we're being brought into through administration after administration.
[03:08:28.368 --> 03:08:29.849]  The Obama deception does it.
[03:08:29.849 --> 03:08:33.011]  I want you to get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:08:33.011 --> 03:08:38.574]  I want you to commit to buy a hundred blank DVDs and I want you to make copies and give them out.
[03:08:38.574 --> 03:08:42.896]  If we move against them and show the hardcore tyranny they're carrying out, we can beat them.
[03:08:42.896 --> 03:08:45.697]  If you're listening on AM or FM stations, stop at red lights.
[03:08:45.697 --> 03:08:47.418]  Tell people to tune in right now.
[03:08:47.418 --> 03:08:48.399]  Tell them about the internet.
[03:08:49.059 --> 03:08:53.223]  I don't know many other shows, and I wish they were, covering this information.
[03:08:53.223 --> 03:09:00.048]  Instead, all they do is cover me, jealously, in the Patriot Movement, and attack me 24-7, because we're the biggest show!
[03:09:00.048 --> 03:09:03.271]  Well, they don't understand, I'm the reason we're successful, because we're real!
[03:09:03.271 --> 03:09:09.135]  We don't have any future, folks, if we don't stop this!
[03:09:09.135 --> 03:09:10.597]  This country is just rotten!
[03:09:10.597 --> 03:09:16.481]  There's so many stupid people, mentally ill people, people that don't have the normalcy to get angry!
[03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:22.221]  My God, and yeah, it's all over the news that they passed it.
[03:09:22.221 --> 03:09:24.482]  They're saying, oh, it's just a little service thing, it's no big deal.
[03:09:24.482 --> 03:09:25.943]  It's compulsory!
[03:09:25.943 --> 03:09:27.464]  It's setting it up!
[03:09:27.464 --> 03:09:28.985]  It says compulsory!
[03:09:28.985 --> 03:09:29.745]  It says it!
[03:09:29.745 --> 03:09:30.285]  It says it!
[03:09:30.285 --> 03:09:31.586]  It says it!
[03:09:31.586 --> 03:09:36.748]  They've got military taking over every major police department openly!
[03:09:36.748 --> 03:09:38.269]  They're openly taking over!
[03:09:41.288 --> 03:09:42.309]  Well, Watson, I'm going to shut up.
[03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:45.531]  I want you to just recap what we're dealing with here.
[03:09:45.531 --> 03:09:50.434]  And in the article you're going to have out in the next hour or two, this needs to go supernova like nothing you've ever written.
[03:09:50.434 --> 03:10:01.762]  I am begging people, if you care about your future, your children, if you don't want to be slaves, because now they're setting up the body to administer at a new federal agency, we must just scream bloody murder, say no to all of it.
[03:10:02.082 --> 03:10:07.485]  What's interesting about this quote out of the New York Times article is that Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, said that this, and they call it an army,
[03:10:32.287 --> 03:10:40.634]  Dispersed to help, to help, with education, health services and the environment, an army, would number about 7 million people.
[03:10:40.634 --> 03:10:47.339]  Yeah, that's what, John, that's what the, that's what the CNN piece, I interrupted, I'm sorry, but that's what the CNN piece says, army, army, army.
[03:10:47.339 --> 03:10:49.821]  And then, CC, they're getting you ready for that, go ahead.
[03:10:49.821 --> 03:10:52.223]  7 million people.
[03:10:52.223 --> 03:11:00.190]  Now, about one in every 50 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi, back in communist East Germany.
[03:11:01.331 --> 03:11:06.193]  Seven million is about one for every 50 Americans.
[03:11:06.193 --> 03:11:07.994]  In fact it's more than that.
[03:11:17.363 --> 03:11:22.567]  InfraGarde Executives and Infrastructure Protection was shooting to kill orders for Marshall Law Mainstream News.
[03:11:22.567 --> 03:11:25.109]  Mainstream News!
[03:11:25.109 --> 03:11:30.372]  The 26,000 clergy response teams for Marshall Law to tell their flock to turn in their guns and go to the camps.
[03:11:30.372 --> 03:11:32.013]  That's in the document!
[03:11:32.013 --> 03:11:33.694]  You understand, folks?
[03:11:33.694 --> 03:11:34.575]  It's in the document!
[03:11:34.575 --> 03:11:40.299]  It's in their secret training that we got a year and a half before it was mainstream news and we got called liars, just like MYAC.
[03:11:40.299 --> 03:11:42.780]  Okay, now let me expand on that, folks.
[03:11:43.877 --> 03:11:47.279]  You know, it just hit me like a ton of bricks that they're just going to do everything.
[03:11:47.279 --> 03:11:51.161]  This means the Congress are total whores and will pass anything and do anything.
[03:11:51.161 --> 03:11:59.165]  They've got bills introduced, moving through the legislature federally to literally ban semi-autos, psychological testing, gun bans, shutting down gun shows.
[03:11:59.165 --> 03:12:02.667]  They're openly announcing it.
[03:12:02.667 --> 03:12:03.807]  Paul, go ahead.
[03:12:03.807 --> 03:12:05.008]  Go ahead and recap.
[03:12:05.008 --> 03:12:06.709]  Say what you just said again.
[03:12:06.709 --> 03:12:12.392]  A 7 million, he just announced a 13 million separate volunteer army.
[03:12:12.392 --> 03:12:12.712]  Go ahead.
[03:12:14.264 --> 03:12:34.251]  Yeah, it's a quote from Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, said that 7 million people will be engaged in such work, and it's called an army, dispersed to help with education, health services and the environment, which would vastly enlarge the notion of, quote, community organizing.
[03:12:35.186 --> 03:12:43.331]  So 7 million is about 1 for every 50 people in the United States, which is equivalent to what it was in Nazi East Germany.
[03:12:43.331 --> 03:12:48.934]  And remember 5 years ago when it broke and nobody could believe it and we went to the U.S.
[03:12:48.934 --> 03:12:51.415]  Congress and the funding for it and it was confirmed?
[03:12:51.415 --> 03:12:53.176]  I didn't believe it when Al Martin reported it.
[03:12:54.562 --> 03:12:56.183]  It was true!
[03:12:56.183 --> 03:13:03.206]  They hired Marcus Wolf, he died last year, the former head of the Stasi, and Primakov, the former Russian KGB chief.
[03:13:03.206 --> 03:13:08.369]  For two years, they consulted on how to do this.
[03:13:08.369 --> 03:13:09.029]  That's right.
[03:13:09.029 --> 03:13:16.353]  And I mean, this is the massive turnover for people losing their jobs because of the economy.
[03:13:16.353 --> 03:13:23.557]  They're all going to be hired by the government, and you're going to have the same situation that we've got in the UK, where this common purpose group
[03:13:24.062 --> 03:13:26.103]  Now here is the key, the key to all of this.
[03:13:45.089 --> 03:13:46.250]  It's how they introduce it.
[03:13:46.250 --> 03:13:49.193]  Again, we know we've said this, but you've got to explain it to everybody.
[03:13:49.193 --> 03:13:52.196]  Oh, there's going to be troops, and now they are, at DWI checkpoints.
[03:13:52.196 --> 03:13:54.018]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[03:13:54.018 --> 03:13:56.821]  Now there's going to be troops at car wrecks helping with the Jaws of Life.
[03:13:56.821 --> 03:13:57.341]  You're for that.
[03:13:57.341 --> 03:14:01.305]  Oh, now at a mass shooting in Alabama, regular army's going to be there.
[03:14:01.305 --> 03:14:02.747]  That's how they're rolling that out.
[03:14:02.747 --> 03:14:07.992]  Now, but when you read the Pentagon documents, it's to quote, engage military operations against the American people.
[03:14:09.813 --> 03:14:11.214]  How do they roll out national service?
[03:14:11.214 --> 03:14:24.522]  Oh, we're going to help with soup kitchens for the homeless, and then, by the way, we're going to train the kids with M-16s how to do warrant service, cordon and lockdown of cities, this is in the mainstream news, and tattletale squads and everything else to take over your local communities and federalize them.
[03:14:24.522 --> 03:14:37.210]  So see, they introduced this in the news like, oh, it's really going to help everybody with the imploding economy, when for decades they've been setting it up for the crises time, the rioting, the breakdown of society that's now being brought in.
[03:14:37.210 --> 03:14:37.530]  Go ahead.
[03:14:38.991 --> 03:14:43.774]  That's right, which is going to be kicked off with the G20 at the start of next month.
[03:14:43.774 --> 03:14:54.280]  What's weird about this Senate passage is that they later cited an evangelical preacher who supports it called Rick Warren.
[03:14:55.154 --> 03:15:00.759]  Who's given lectures for the Council on Foreign Relations and the Davos Group.
[03:15:00.759 --> 03:15:01.779]  And that's another point!
[03:15:01.779 --> 03:15:03.261]  That's another point!
[03:15:03.261 --> 03:15:08.225]  Bush spent nine billion a year on faith-based initiative, buying off the churches, violating the First Amendment.
[03:15:08.225 --> 03:15:14.410]  Clearly, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or the press.
[03:15:14.410 --> 03:15:15.090]  And it goes on.
[03:15:15.090 --> 03:15:19.234]  Now Obama's increasing it to thirteen billion, and all the Democrats love it.
[03:15:19.234 --> 03:15:19.634]  Go ahead.
[03:15:19.634 --> 03:15:23.037]  Right, so this guy who performed Obama's
[03:15:23.442 --> 03:15:26.463]  Invocation and he received awards from Bush as well.
[03:15:26.463 --> 03:15:36.527]  He was one of the chief cheerleaders behind this national civilian service bill which has just been passed.
[03:15:36.527 --> 03:15:47.252]  So it's got links to evangelical elitists who have got links to the CFR and the Davos Economic Forum and places like that.
[03:15:49.461 --> 03:15:50.461]  Oh, man.
[03:15:50.461 --> 03:15:52.442]  Paul, you know, this is a normal response.
[03:15:52.442 --> 03:15:53.903]  I say this all the time.
[03:15:53.903 --> 03:16:07.047]  You go to a UT football game, I've been to many of them, you know, back in college and things, and the people are yelling, they're screaming, they're painted up, their faces are, you know, painted up orange or whatever the opposing team is, everybody's screaming, that's normal.
[03:16:07.047 --> 03:16:14.850]  But you yell and scream about total end of America, total takeover by hardcore criminals with the banks looting everything, world government openly being announced,
[03:16:16.018 --> 03:16:28.023]  You see, they take sports and put your regular tribal mechanism to get angry and get motivated, they take it and shunt it off into petty gladiatorial diversions, and then I'm weird because I'm freaking out.
[03:16:28.023 --> 03:16:29.463]  Officially, the country's dead.
[03:16:29.463 --> 03:16:33.905]  We may be able to resuscitate it, but I mean, this means, like, all these tumblers click.
[03:16:33.905 --> 03:16:37.526]  It means the Congress is totally criminal, is going to do whatever he says.
[03:16:37.526 --> 03:16:39.187]  If they'll pass a national draft,
[03:16:39.807 --> 03:16:42.669]  Yeah, and then he'd have to be forced to watch the spectacle of Obama.
[03:17:04.716 --> 03:17:09.037]  On the CBS interview, just laughing about it all, laughing it up about the economy.
[03:17:09.037 --> 03:17:12.238]  And whenever you see Beedon, he's always laughing it up as well.
[03:17:12.238 --> 03:17:13.859]  And it's just a big joke.
[03:17:13.859 --> 03:17:14.939]  It's disgusting.
[03:17:14.939 --> 03:17:16.299]  Well, they're criminals.
[03:17:16.299 --> 03:17:22.901]  And the best way to rob a house or something is to go in dressed like your workman and just load everything in a moving van.
[03:17:22.901 --> 03:17:24.282]  And they're just in the workman uniform.
[03:17:25.382 --> 03:17:26.682]  Make the move, you know, see the neighbor.
[03:17:26.682 --> 03:17:28.683]  No, Bob didn't tell me he was moving.
[03:17:28.683 --> 03:17:30.003]  Oh, yeah, he's moving.
[03:17:30.003 --> 03:17:37.946]  Then they come out with the couches and the safe and the computers and the jewelry and, you know, they're in a workman outfit and they're just kind of, ha ha ha!
[03:17:37.946 --> 03:17:41.107]  And even the 60 Minutes interviewer said, are you punch drunk?
[03:17:41.107 --> 03:17:41.787]  Why is this funny?
[03:17:41.787 --> 03:17:42.627]  Because Obama says, ha ha!
[03:17:44.569 --> 03:17:48.033]  Now, if you notice the info babes on CNN and Fox, that's what they do.
[03:17:48.033 --> 03:17:52.357]  It's all, Hi, World Government, it's so good!
[03:17:52.357 --> 03:17:58.784]  It's like he projects this fake, I'm happy, it's fun, there's nothing to worry about, everything's great!
[03:18:00.566 --> 03:18:03.688]  They're making their move at light speed.
[03:18:03.688 --> 03:18:06.871]  Listen to me out there, people that laugh at us and make jokes about it.
[03:18:06.871 --> 03:18:09.713]  I know on YouTube, when this video is posted, there'll be jokes about me getting upset.
[03:18:09.713 --> 03:18:11.934]  Listen to me, jackasses.
[03:18:11.934 --> 03:18:15.197]  They've already taken half of the pension funds' wealth.
[03:18:15.197 --> 03:18:17.138]  They've already taken half the stock market's wealth.
[03:18:17.138 --> 03:18:19.400]  I know you don't have a pension fund, so you're laughing at it.
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:20.801]  No, that affects your job.
[03:18:20.801 --> 03:18:22.902]  They're going to loot everything we got.
[03:18:22.902 --> 03:18:27.686]  They went in Argentina for being as wealthy as us in two weeks to being one of the poorest countries in the world.
[03:18:28.965 --> 03:18:31.627]  These people destroy nations.
[03:18:31.627 --> 03:18:34.628]  These people mass murder.
[03:18:34.628 --> 03:18:37.410]  They are going to mass murder us.
[03:18:37.410 --> 03:18:38.651]  They are eugenicists.
[03:18:38.651 --> 03:18:39.531]  Do you understand?
[03:18:39.531 --> 03:18:41.873]  They want to reorganize the United States.
[03:18:41.873 --> 03:18:46.816]  They are going to destroy the economy further so they can be the savior.
[03:18:46.816 --> 03:18:50.318]  Just like they staged terror attacks on 9-11, they have staged this.
[03:18:50.658 --> 03:18:55.620]  And it's now time to grow up and realize how dark and how late the hour is.
[03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:59.082]  There's no more time to play games or screw around.
[03:18:59.082 --> 03:19:05.105]  I knew they were doing this, but to see them pass, all the things they're passing, lets me know they're going for broke.
[03:19:05.105 --> 03:19:06.505]  They're going all the way.
[03:19:06.505 --> 03:19:11.047]  They've left the path of incrementalism, and they're going full bore, Paul.
[03:19:11.047 --> 03:19:14.069]  That's right.
[03:19:14.069 --> 03:19:19.391]  Meanwhile, the big establishment liberal websites are talking about
[03:19:20.439 --> 03:19:24.300]  Al Gore's got a new book, and O'Reilly made a sexist comment.
[03:19:24.300 --> 03:19:31.241]  So that's the level of mindlessness that's going on while all this is being passed right in front of our faces.
[03:19:31.241 --> 03:19:36.423]  And the conservative sites are talking about how the Republicans will save us when they're voting en masse for all of this.
[03:19:36.423 --> 03:19:42.904]  Paul, I want you to write the master article with all of these points in it, and I'm telling listeners, how long until the article's done?
[03:19:42.904 --> 03:19:46.965]  Because I want everybody, T-minus, to count down to supernova this article everywhere.
[03:19:46.965 --> 03:19:47.365]  How long?
[03:19:48.755 --> 03:19:50.596]  Within 90 minutes.
[03:19:50.596 --> 03:20:00.722]  Within T-minus 90 minutes, so at about 4.30 central time.
[03:20:00.722 --> 03:20:01.662]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.662 --> 03:20:03.343]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:20:03.343 --> 03:20:05.084]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:20:05.084 --> 03:20:12.488]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:16.093]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:20:16.093 --> 03:20:32.568]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:20:32.568 --> 03:20:34.570]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:20:34.570 --> 03:20:36.292]  I use one every day.
[03:20:36.292 --> 03:20:38.754]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:20:39.034 --> 03:20:39.994]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:05.014 --> 03:21:11.055]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:21:11.055 --> 03:21:11.876]  That's right.
[03:21:11.876 --> 03:21:14.716]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:21:14.716 --> 03:21:22.198]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:21:22.198 --> 03:21:29.840]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:30.325 --> 03:21:35.807]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:21:35.807 --> 03:21:41.629]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:41.629 --> 03:21:46.131]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:21:46.131 --> 03:21:46.391]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:46.391 --> 03:21:48.392]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:21:48.392 --> 03:21:48.992]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:48.992 --> 03:21:49.272]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.222 --> 03:22:07.471]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:08.263 --> 03:22:14.148]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:14.148 --> 03:22:20.634]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:20.634 --> 03:22:22.615]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:22.615 --> 03:22:25.078]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:22:25.078 --> 03:22:35.967]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:22:38.251 --> 03:22:39.912]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:39.912 --> 03:22:41.773]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:22:41.773 --> 03:22:48.698]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:48.698 --> 03:22:56.964]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:58.525]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.525 --> 03:22:59.726]  The people strike back.
[03:23:01.369 --> 03:23:05.072]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:23:05.072 --> 03:23:10.798]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:23:10.798 --> 03:23:15.141]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:23:15.141 --> 03:23:17.604]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[03:23:17.604 --> 03:23:23.729]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and
[03:23:23.729 --> 03:23:24.189]  We're good to go!
[03:23:52.854 --> 03:23:53.575]  I'm ready for it.
[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:35.754]  Well, here it's fine If you've got the time And the time to get yourself in And here it's tight Almost every night But now I might be mistaken
[03:24:39.893 --> 03:24:41.094]  I am a primitive person.
[03:24:41.094 --> 03:24:58.329]  I'm intellectual in my analysis of things, but then when I know I have an enemy, and I know they're murdering, disgusting, enslaving trash, it isn't even hatred I have of them, it is just will to defeat them.
[03:24:58.329 --> 03:25:04.415]  It is exploding understanding and research and years of dedicated focus
[03:25:06.109 --> 03:25:08.751]  I just want to pass it on to everybody else.
[03:25:08.751 --> 03:25:10.192]  I want people to rise up.
[03:25:10.192 --> 03:25:13.434]  I want to beat these bastards!
[03:25:13.434 --> 03:25:14.655]  God, they're so criminal!
[03:25:14.655 --> 03:25:15.755]  It should be so easy!
[03:25:15.755 --> 03:25:21.719]  They're so obviously disgusting and un-American filth!
[03:25:21.719 --> 03:25:22.960]  Pull up the CNN piece.
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:25.582]  Now, this is a disgusting CNN puff piece from Saturday.
[03:25:27.847 --> 03:25:29.487]  This disgusting CNN puff piece.
[03:25:29.487 --> 03:25:32.808]  Listen to how they call it an army and a ground force.
[03:25:32.808 --> 03:25:34.008]  And it's going to be mandatory.
[03:25:34.008 --> 03:25:41.370]  See, they go in people's doors and they make the people that don't like Obama look bad, but the nice people that do, pledging.
[03:25:41.370 --> 03:25:43.711]  And this is with government funds this is all going on.
[03:25:43.711 --> 03:25:46.891]  This is the total takeover of society.
[03:25:46.891 --> 03:25:47.512]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:25:49.807 --> 03:25:50.488]  Good morning, Karen.
[03:25:50.488 --> 03:25:58.117]  President Obama won the election with the help of an army of grassroots supporters who organized online, then took their message to the streets.
[03:25:58.117 --> 03:26:02.763]  Now the president is calling on his volunteers once again to sell more than a campaign.
[03:26:06.994 --> 03:26:09.135]  Don't tell them the race is over.
[03:26:09.135 --> 03:26:15.079]  Once volunteers for the Obama campaign... I just want to ask you if you support that and if you're willing to sign this petition.
[03:26:15.079 --> 03:26:18.200]  Oh, definitely.
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:20.161]  The race to destroy the republic.
[03:26:20.161 --> 03:26:23.143]  The race to butcher the Bill of Rights from pillar to post.
[03:26:23.143 --> 03:26:23.964]  Go back to it, please.
[03:26:24.804 --> 03:26:27.686]  His network of supporters is back on the trail.
[03:26:27.686 --> 03:26:29.067]  Basically just, here's the plan.
[03:26:29.067 --> 03:26:29.867]  Reactivated.
[03:26:29.867 --> 03:26:32.689]  This time, to sell the president's agenda.
[03:26:32.689 --> 03:26:33.670]  Would you be interested in signing up?
[03:26:33.670 --> 03:26:34.950]  I'm interested in talking about it.
[03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:38.813]  I'm not saying that I'm interested in supporting all of his plans.
[03:26:38.813 --> 03:26:42.015]  I'm part of a nationwide movement today called Organizing for America.
[03:26:42.415 --> 03:26:47.198]  Michael LaFemmina was one of hundreds of volunteers who went door-to-door from New York.
[03:26:47.198 --> 03:26:48.419]  No money is involved.
[03:26:48.419 --> 03:26:51.941]  And now the liberal is for a total draft for everybody.
[03:26:51.941 --> 03:26:57.224]  Oh, it's so liberal and nothing but lobbyists and nothing but banker takeovers and attacks on free speech.
[03:26:57.224 --> 03:26:59.445]  They're announcing fairness doctrine to ban films.
[03:26:59.445 --> 03:27:01.907]  Associated Press criticizing the government.
[03:27:01.907 --> 03:27:03.227]  I mean, it's all happening.
[03:27:03.227 --> 03:27:05.789]  These sons of... They're trying it!
[03:27:05.789 --> 03:27:06.609]  They're doing it!
[03:27:06.609 --> 03:27:09.031]  I just can't believe it!
[03:27:09.031 --> 03:27:10.011]  It's so incredible!
[03:27:10.011 --> 03:27:10.712]  Go back to them!
[03:27:12.765 --> 03:27:13.025]  Really?
[03:27:13.025 --> 03:27:13.786]  I've got my checkbook.
[03:27:25.183 --> 03:27:27.184]  Simulcast with the Army's announcement.
[03:27:27.184 --> 03:27:32.025]  Defense Department announced a civilian expeditionary force for here in the US, drafted and overseas.
[03:27:32.025 --> 03:27:45.309]  Merging with laws to back it up, and they use government funding to advertise Organizing for America and usaservice.org to get people to join with US government funding for Obama and his agenda to then lobby the Congress.
[03:27:45.309 --> 03:27:51.950]  This is the executive taking over the Congress, and the Congress is just going, yeah, we're bending over, we're taking it, we love it.
[03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:53.771]  This is what Hitler did, folks.
[03:27:54.571 --> 03:27:55.191]  Back to it!
[03:27:55.191 --> 03:27:57.272]  I feel like I'm volunteering for President Obama.
[03:27:57.272 --> 03:28:02.473]  I feel like I'm volunteering for myself, for our country, for our democracy.
[03:28:02.473 --> 03:28:03.374]  How'd they do it?
[03:28:03.374 --> 03:28:11.036]  Using the campaign's old email list, Organizing for America alerted supporters to visit its website, where a message from the President was waiting.
[03:28:11.036 --> 03:28:15.417]  Talk to some neighbors, and let people know how important this budget is to our future.
[03:28:15.417 --> 03:28:16.197]  And voila!
[03:28:16.197 --> 03:28:20.198]  If you would provide your name and some contact information, we'll make sure we get information.
[03:28:20.198 --> 03:28:21.819]  I'll be happy to do that.
[03:28:22.099 --> 03:28:25.622]  The mission on this outing, to blunt criticism from Republicans.
[03:28:25.622 --> 03:28:33.407]  If we maintain the proposals which are in this budget, over the ten year period that this budget covers, this country will go bankrupt.
[03:28:33.407 --> 03:28:37.050]  And even a few skeptical Democrats over the President's budget.
[03:28:37.050 --> 03:28:40.092]  I'm especially concerned about the long term.
[03:28:40.092 --> 03:28:41.713]  He's not qualified to play.
[03:28:41.713 --> 03:28:42.133]  Head pause.
[03:28:42.133 --> 03:28:42.934]  See that on the screen?
[03:28:42.934 --> 03:28:43.655]  Put it back up.
[03:28:43.655 --> 03:28:45.916]  Obama's army.
[03:28:45.916 --> 03:28:49.319]  But what they don't tell you is, they're getting used to that term, it is an army.
[03:28:49.319 --> 03:28:50.820]  It's in the bill, it's passed.
[03:28:53.427 --> 03:28:56.950]  And these are going to be the commissars, the political police over you.
[03:28:56.950 --> 03:29:06.676]  You can go to his website and watch him address thousands of preachers, all the leaders, and he says, I want you to be on your block, I want you to convince your neighbors, I want you to help your neighbors, and watch your neighbors.
[03:29:06.676 --> 03:29:11.520]  And they just announce it like it's all cute and sweet, oh we're watching you, oh we're here!
[03:29:11.520 --> 03:29:14.782]  Same thing in England, same thing in Australia.
[03:29:14.782 --> 03:29:17.644]  And there's huge numbers of Republicans that are voting for all of this.
[03:29:17.644 --> 03:29:18.104]  You know why?
[03:29:18.104 --> 03:29:21.247]  Because they're getting millions of phone calls from the Obama idiots.
[03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:25.732]  We'll come back, finish up the clip, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:25.732 --> 03:29:28.814]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically on the New World Order takeover.
[03:29:28.814 --> 03:29:30.115]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:30.115 --> 03:29:37.780]  Again, when I saw this had passed, a splitting headache hit me, and then it just turned into rage, because I'm normal.
[03:29:37.780 --> 03:29:39.021]  I'm sane.
[03:29:39.021 --> 03:29:42.624]  I know that these murdering bastards are dangerous.
[03:29:42.624 --> 03:29:45.065]  I know they want to do here what they did in Iraq.
[03:29:45.065 --> 03:29:46.306]  They're taking us over.
[03:29:46.306 --> 03:29:48.548]  This is toe-to-toe New World Order combat.
[03:29:51.846 --> 03:29:55.767]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.767 --> 03:30:01.769]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.769 --> 03:30:05.771]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[03:30:05.771 --> 03:30:10.612]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[03:30:10.612 --> 03:30:13.533]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[03:30:13.533 --> 03:30:17.995]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[03:30:17.995 --> 03:30:18.975]  Every three seconds,
[03:30:19.155 --> 03:30:19.716]  We're good to go.
[03:30:45.199 --> 03:30:48.062]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.018 --> 03:31:15.584]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.584 --> 03:31:22.190]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.190 --> 03:31:24.151]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.151 --> 03:31:26.653]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.653 --> 03:31:37.602]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.237 --> 03:31:39.899]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.899 --> 03:31:41.760]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:41.760 --> 03:31:48.667]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:56.934 --> 03:31:58.516]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.516 --> 03:31:59.697]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.391 --> 03:32:09.860]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[03:32:09.860 --> 03:32:20.571]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins.
[03:32:20.831 --> 03:32:24.994]  And helps provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout.
[03:32:24.994 --> 03:32:29.918]  Nutriodine is made with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine.
[03:32:29.918 --> 03:32:33.080]  Nutriodine should be used by all ages every day.
[03:32:33.080 --> 03:32:36.963]  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid, and mitochondria function.
[03:32:36.963 --> 03:32:39.345]  Or if you just want to feel better from day to day.
[03:32:39.345 --> 03:32:41.286]  Nutriodine drops are for you.
[03:32:41.286 --> 03:32:43.147]  There are several forms of iodine.
[03:32:43.147 --> 03:32:45.449]  Nutriodine is the only trusted source.
[03:32:45.509 --> 03:32:45.829]  We're good.
[03:33:09.414 --> 03:33:20.578]  That's why they're creating a counterfeit grassroots movement under federal law to silence your free speech, to bring you into full bondage.
[03:33:20.578 --> 03:33:28.960]  Meanwhile, the death threats to my family, the harassment, the attacks is just off the charts, which lets me know we are very close to the heart of beating these people.
[03:33:28.960 --> 03:33:36.923]  Because we are reaching out to you, those that have the power of the human spirit with God's guidance to crush these bastards.
[03:33:38.462 --> 03:33:41.344]  This is the most virulent form of tyranny.
[03:33:41.344 --> 03:33:45.227]  I have analyzed it coldly in a calculated fashion for years.
[03:33:45.227 --> 03:33:53.072]  They are planning to bring in total depression, set up a police state, and then start mass arrests and mass executions.
[03:33:53.072 --> 03:33:54.653]  This is the globalist.
[03:33:54.653 --> 03:33:55.694]  This is the New World Order.
[03:33:55.694 --> 03:33:57.215]  This is what they do everywhere.
[03:33:57.215 --> 03:34:00.717]  They now are going to do it in the United States.
[03:34:00.717 --> 03:34:06.361]  Millions of police and military will die in this fight.
[03:34:06.361 --> 03:34:08.002]  Millions of citizens are going to die.
[03:34:10.188 --> 03:34:11.569]  It's real.
[03:34:11.569 --> 03:34:12.789]  I try to deny it every day.
[03:34:12.789 --> 03:34:16.591]  I try to ignore the analysis that I've done and many other experts have done.
[03:34:16.591 --> 03:34:21.253]  This is for real.
[03:34:21.253 --> 03:34:27.916]  This is the greatest challenge this nation and this world has ever faced.
[03:34:27.916 --> 03:34:32.518]  If we don't stand up and be heard now and get really aggressive in the info war,
[03:34:33.991 --> 03:34:36.053]  It's going to become a physical war.
[03:34:36.053 --> 03:34:41.056]  The globalists have successfully mass-murdered worldwide and organized it and done it.
[03:34:41.056 --> 03:34:45.560]  They believe they can do it here, they pass upon a return, it's who they are.
[03:34:45.560 --> 03:34:46.901]  I've analyzed that as well.
[03:34:46.901 --> 03:34:48.462]  They are going to fail.
[03:34:48.462 --> 03:34:50.804]  They are assured in failing.
[03:34:50.804 --> 03:34:54.167]  The question is, how devastating is this going to be?
[03:34:54.167 --> 03:34:57.909]  The question is, how bad is this going to fight going to get?
[03:34:57.909 --> 03:34:59.691]  How many of us are going to be lost and imprisoned?
[03:35:03.809 --> 03:35:12.516]  I pledge myself again, my name, my sacred honor, all of my treasure, my very blood in the fight against tyranny.
[03:35:12.516 --> 03:35:21.542]  If my blood is needed to nourish the tree of liberty, I gladly will sacrifice it.
[03:35:21.542 --> 03:35:27.227]  And it is through that willingness to lay down your life that you are given life, that you are given justice.
[03:35:28.482 --> 03:35:33.818]  Those that are not willing to lay down their life for their brethren will lose it.
[03:35:33.818 --> 03:35:35.803]  And those that are willing to lay down their life will gain it.
[03:35:36.786 --> 03:35:42.248]  Because when you're cowed, when you're a coward, when you lay down, that makes the wolves come.
[03:35:42.248 --> 03:35:45.510]  That encourages the criminals to take over society.
[03:35:45.510 --> 03:36:00.777]  But when you're willing to fight, and you're willing... You know, folks, when I went out two months before 9-11, said they were going to attack the World Trade Center, staged that attack, lost two-thirds of my radio stations, got attacked, lost my sponsors, could barely even pay my bills, could barely pay my house payment.
[03:36:00.777 --> 03:36:01.717]  It didn't matter to me.
[03:36:01.717 --> 03:36:02.978]  I knew it was the right thing to do.
[03:36:02.978 --> 03:36:04.578]  We gained more stations back.
[03:36:04.578 --> 03:36:05.439]  We got bigger than ever.
[03:36:07.037 --> 03:36:12.801]  Some liberals didn't understand and thought I was bashing just Bush.
[03:36:12.801 --> 03:36:15.743]  Those stations dropped me when I started going after Obama.
[03:36:15.743 --> 03:36:16.704]  It doesn't matter.
[03:36:16.704 --> 03:36:18.045]  You have to sacrifice.
[03:36:18.045 --> 03:36:22.108]  You have to not care what people say or what they think of you.
[03:36:22.108 --> 03:36:24.370]  If you can't do that, folks, you will be enslaved.
[03:36:26.325 --> 03:36:28.967]  To the military, to the police, you know the tyranny is coming.
[03:36:28.967 --> 03:36:30.468]  You've been told martial law is coming.
[03:36:30.468 --> 03:36:31.608]  You've been told they're setting it up.
[03:36:31.608 --> 03:36:33.209]  Now you know I warned you years before.
[03:36:33.209 --> 03:36:34.370]  We have the government documents.
[03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:43.816]  Please, men and women, old, young, it doesn't matter, people in the system, people that are going to be asked to carry this out, do whatever you can to get the documents to us and others.
[03:36:43.816 --> 03:36:46.358]  Do whatever you can to speak out against this.
[03:36:46.358 --> 03:36:50.641]  Do whatever you can to fight this, especially those in the system.
[03:36:50.641 --> 03:36:52.242]  We're all in the system to one degree or another.
[03:36:54.136 --> 03:36:55.977]  It's just all real.
[03:36:55.977 --> 03:37:01.919]  I intellectually, coldly analyze it, and what comes out of the process is pure hell.
[03:37:01.919 --> 03:37:05.060]  You know, it's like, my God, I can't believe what I've arrived at.
[03:37:05.060 --> 03:37:07.281]  Because, folks, what I arrive at has always come true.
[03:37:07.281 --> 03:37:08.382]  I know history.
[03:37:08.382 --> 03:37:10.842]  I have an integrated fusion of analysis and data.
[03:37:10.842 --> 03:37:12.203]  I have that gift.
[03:37:12.203 --> 03:37:14.204]  I don't have the gift of articulating the full picture.
[03:37:14.204 --> 03:37:16.165]  People think I have this gift of articulation.
[03:37:16.165 --> 03:37:17.085]  No, I don't have that gift.
[03:37:17.085 --> 03:37:18.385]  I have the gift of understanding it.
[03:37:25.479 --> 03:37:28.841]  And people that are awake to the New World Order, we have to get our heads screwed on straight.
[03:37:28.841 --> 03:37:34.183]  So many people dither and fight about who's behind it or who the heads of it are, all this stuff all day long.
[03:37:34.183 --> 03:37:35.343]  Who does it matter who runs it?
[03:37:35.343 --> 03:37:37.864]  Arrest the bankers, we know they're running it.
[03:37:37.864 --> 03:37:42.967]  Don't let them pull race and other things into it so that we can't get the biggest movement we can.
[03:37:42.967 --> 03:37:44.987]  That's meant to sabotage us.
[03:37:44.987 --> 03:37:47.809]  The enemy is coming after me right now, folks, in every way.
[03:37:48.894 --> 03:37:50.395]  Because I am unifying people.
[03:37:50.395 --> 03:37:52.416]  You, my listeners, are unifying.
[03:37:52.416 --> 03:37:53.496]  You are great leaders.
[03:37:53.496 --> 03:37:58.138]  You are taking action in just beautiful ways.
[03:37:58.138 --> 03:38:01.980]  And I need people to pray for us here at this office, though.
[03:38:01.980 --> 03:38:07.363]  And I need to pray for not just myself, the people that have the courage to work here, the courage to go through what they go through.
[03:38:07.363 --> 03:38:11.404]  I want to commend all of you out there.
[03:38:11.404 --> 03:38:12.465]  I want to commend you right now.
[03:38:17.403 --> 03:38:21.625]  And I don't know if I'll make it through all this, but I know this, we're going to beat these bastards in the end.
[03:38:21.625 --> 03:38:30.491]  God's promised us that, and... All the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to put the stinking New World Order together.
[03:38:30.491 --> 03:38:36.054]  It is going to be forged, it will rise, and it will begin collapsing the moment they put the capstone on it.
[03:38:39.841 --> 03:38:43.484]  You look at that man on your screen, Barack Obama, that is a would-be dictator.
[03:38:43.484 --> 03:38:46.067]  That is the elite empowering him.
[03:38:46.067 --> 03:38:48.109]  You want to see a Stalin or a Hitler?
[03:38:48.109 --> 03:38:50.511]  You are looking at the next Adolf Hitler.
[03:38:50.511 --> 03:38:55.215]  You are looking at the next Joseph Stalin.
[03:38:55.215 --> 03:38:58.459]  He has a spirit of wicked power.
[03:38:58.459 --> 03:39:00.320]  He has a spirit of deception.
[03:39:00.320 --> 03:39:02.823]  He is highest caliber evil.
[03:39:04.974 --> 03:39:27.379]  You know, my father, who never gets into religion, never, you know, he's Christian, but he doesn't thump the Bible, he doesn't go to mainline church, well, I guess they go to the Methodist some, but the point is, they're going back to church these days, but he goes to Germany a couple times in the last few years, because we have family over there, and they go over and see him, and my father called me up Saturday morning, and he goes,
[03:39:28.999 --> 03:39:31.060]  Son, I just watched the Obama deception on DVD.
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:33.721]  It's here online, he said, that you gave us.
[03:39:33.721 --> 03:39:52.849]  He said, I recognize where Obama was in his New World Order speech he gave in Berlin because I've been there several times and he'd come over to my house when he was last there six months ago and showed me all these photos of the Pergamon Gate of the museum that's right there at the Pergamon Gate where the Nazis had the Pergamon Gate.
[03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:53.349]  There were
[03:39:55.143 --> 03:40:03.949]  Obama gave his speech, and people pointed out that's where Hitler gave his most important speeches, was where Obama was standing.
[03:40:03.949 --> 03:40:06.130]  And he called for a new world order there.
[03:40:06.130 --> 03:40:08.952]  Now here's Obama, and these men are anti-Christ.
[03:40:08.952 --> 03:40:11.053]  The Bible says there are many anti-Christ.
[03:40:11.053 --> 03:40:13.155]  It is a prototype, it is a spirit.
[03:40:13.155 --> 03:40:16.577]  Here he is standing, he chooses where Hitler spoke.
[03:40:18.939 --> 03:40:23.783]  Just a few feet away from him is the window in the famous things when Hitler was elected, waving at everybody.
[03:40:23.783 --> 03:40:39.416]  Now right in that building behind him is the Germans, before World War I, went to Babylon, just south of Baghdad today, 30 miles south there.
[03:40:39.416 --> 03:40:40.417]  They went to Babylon.
[03:40:43.730 --> 03:40:53.896]  And they dug up the turquoise blue gates of Babylon and the Pergamon Gate and inside was the seat of Satan in Babylonian.
[03:40:53.896 --> 03:40:54.997]  They worshipped Satan.
[03:40:54.997 --> 03:40:57.458]  That's where that comes from in the Bible.
[03:40:57.458 --> 03:40:59.800]  And the seat of Satan, Hitler believed it gave him power.
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:04.423]  And they built a big concrete dome over it so the air raids couldn't destroy it.
[03:41:04.423 --> 03:41:05.183]  You can't make this up.
[03:41:05.183 --> 03:41:08.965]  My dad calls up and he's sort of reading Revelations to me and he's talking about the Antichrist.
[03:41:08.965 --> 03:41:11.267]  It says we'll speak from the Pergamon Gate and the seat of Satan.
[03:41:13.513 --> 03:41:15.615]  And so that's why Hitler spoke there, and then Obama.
[03:41:15.615 --> 03:41:17.656]  Now, I'm not saying he's the Antichrist, folks.
[03:41:17.656 --> 03:41:19.858]  This is a secular show where I just cover the facts.
[03:41:19.858 --> 03:41:21.359]  And he read me the passage of Revelation.
[03:41:21.359 --> 03:41:24.161]  I forgot it was... Maybe somebody can call in right now?
[03:41:24.161 --> 03:41:32.367]  Well, the lines are loaded.
[03:41:32.367 --> 03:41:33.047]  It's just sick.
[03:41:33.047 --> 03:41:39.912]  It's totally sick.
[03:41:39.912 --> 03:41:42.314]  Let's play the rest of the CNN clip, then I'll go to some calls here.
[03:41:44.082 --> 03:41:56.108]  Regardless, though, intellectually, just from the facts of what he's setting up, and the FEMA camps, and everything the globalists built for him, and how the media is putting all their power behind him like never before, we are in deep trouble.
[03:41:56.108 --> 03:41:58.750]  This is it, folks.
[03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:59.770]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[03:41:59.770 --> 03:42:02.011]  It's coming out of my pocketbook.
[03:42:02.011 --> 03:42:05.873]  As Michael Lefemina found on Long Island, not everybody is sold.
[03:42:05.873 --> 03:42:10.476]  He's already crippled the economy, him and the Democrats.
[03:42:12.149 --> 03:42:12.990]  I don't care.
[03:42:12.990 --> 03:42:13.790]  Let him film it.
[03:42:13.790 --> 03:42:16.712]  These volunteers insist they can take the heat.
[03:42:16.712 --> 03:42:18.654]  Keep up the good work, Obama.
[03:42:18.654 --> 03:42:21.996]  We support him 500, 2000%.
[03:42:21.996 --> 03:42:22.456]  That's right.
[03:42:22.456 --> 03:42:23.157]  Let him film it.
[03:42:23.157 --> 03:42:34.344]  Now, if it works, Organizing for America could put its volunteers to work again on other White House plans, giving the administration a ground force that can gather signatures and work the phones to push the president's agenda.
[03:42:34.344 --> 03:42:38.267]  It has all the makings of a campaign before the re-election campaign.
[03:42:38.267 --> 03:42:41.369]  Karen, not quite putting the band back together, but it's close.
[03:42:41.889 --> 03:42:46.055]  Yeah, exactly, and they're certainly getting an earful, depending on whose door they knock on.
[03:42:46.055 --> 03:42:46.956]  Absolutely.
[03:42:46.956 --> 03:42:48.237]  Thanks so much, Jim.
[03:42:48.237 --> 03:42:48.938]  John, I don't care!
[03:42:48.938 --> 03:42:49.639]  I don't care!
[03:42:49.639 --> 03:42:50.721]  Let him film me!
[03:42:50.721 --> 03:42:51.742]  Exactly.
[03:42:51.742 --> 03:42:55.607]  That guy had his opinions, and he wasn't shy about sharing them, that's for sure.
[03:42:55.607 --> 03:42:56.568]  Oh, they make fun of him.
[03:42:56.568 --> 03:42:57.489]  Okay.
[03:42:57.489 --> 03:42:59.772]  In fact, guys, I'm gonna give you my dad's cell phone number.
[03:43:01.048 --> 03:43:02.349]  He does surgeries on this day.
[03:43:02.349 --> 03:43:02.909]  He's an oral surgeon.
[03:43:02.909 --> 03:43:03.690]  I don't know if he'll be there.
[03:43:03.690 --> 03:43:05.711]  I'm gonna give you my dad's number.
[03:43:05.711 --> 03:43:07.713]  And I want you to give him the Genesis Backline.
[03:43:07.713 --> 03:43:08.714]  You know, that extension?
[03:43:08.714 --> 03:43:15.498]  Because I want him to briefly on air tell the story about the Pergamon Gate.
[03:43:15.498 --> 03:43:18.300]  I may even go into overdrive again.
[03:43:18.300 --> 03:43:19.781]  Guys, come get this number from my father.
[03:43:19.781 --> 03:43:23.844]  Because I was like researching something when he called me.
[03:43:23.844 --> 03:43:24.825]  I wasn't paying full attention.
[03:43:26.192 --> 03:43:27.212]  That's my dad's cell phone.
[03:43:27.212 --> 03:43:28.673]  Give him the Genesis back line.
[03:43:28.673 --> 03:43:30.013]  You know that number?
[03:43:30.013 --> 03:43:30.433]  Guess line?
[03:43:30.433 --> 03:43:30.613]  Okay.
[03:43:30.613 --> 03:43:37.035]  You want me to write it down for you if you don't know it?
[03:43:37.035 --> 03:43:40.076]  And again, remove from the equation whether he's the Antichrist or not.
[03:43:40.076 --> 03:43:41.796]  Let's just secularly look at it.
[03:43:41.796 --> 03:43:44.757]  Why would he go speak from the favorite spot where Hitler spoke?
[03:43:48.373 --> 03:43:51.015]  With the Pergamon Gate behind him in the seat of Satan.
[03:43:51.015 --> 03:43:53.397]  Which they've got behind drapes and won't even let the people at the museum see.
[03:43:53.397 --> 03:43:54.058]  My dad went there.
[03:43:54.058 --> 03:43:55.078]  He shot video of it.
[03:43:55.078 --> 03:43:55.759]  He took photos.
[03:43:55.759 --> 03:43:59.462]  I've watched it at my house.
[03:43:59.462 --> 03:44:02.364]  And they have a display there how Hitler thought he got his power from it.
[03:44:02.364 --> 03:44:09.090]  And then there's Obama going there to speak at the Pergamon Gate.
[03:44:09.090 --> 03:44:09.630]  Did he answer?
[03:44:09.630 --> 03:44:15.195]  Alright.
[03:44:15.195 --> 03:44:17.056]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Kentucky.
[03:44:17.056 --> 03:44:17.737]  Jason, go ahead.
[03:44:18.663 --> 03:44:27.390]  Hey Alex, I'm 29 and I've been married for about a year now and my wife and I are considering having our first child and bringing a baby into this world.
[03:44:27.390 --> 03:44:29.791]  I know you and I are of similar age.
[03:44:29.791 --> 03:44:30.352]  Do it!
[03:44:30.352 --> 03:44:30.852]  Do it!
[03:44:30.852 --> 03:44:33.995]  Do it!
[03:44:33.995 --> 03:44:38.378]  I know children are precious and I do put all my faith in Christ.
[03:44:38.378 --> 03:44:42.121]  When you talk about the New World Order, I know that a child growing up in today's world
[03:44:42.776 --> 03:44:45.438]  It's going to be far different from the one in which you and I grew up in.
[03:44:45.438 --> 03:44:46.098]  Let me stop you.
[03:44:46.098 --> 03:44:54.384]  It's going to be a great blessing to grow up during this time and to go through this persecution and this tribulation system.
[03:44:54.384 --> 03:44:59.328]  Living is, if you make that decision, is that child's destiny.
[03:44:59.328 --> 03:45:01.969]  So just ask God what you think you should do.
[03:45:03.090 --> 03:45:09.533]  As a person with children like yourself and having as much knowledge as you do about the New World Order and just the demise of our country and our world as we know it, where do you find solace or reconciliation
[03:45:25.937 --> 03:45:27.818]  I mean, I'm fearful.
[03:45:27.818 --> 03:45:30.219]  Well, my children have recently been attacked.
[03:45:30.219 --> 03:45:33.780]  We've had phone calls threatening my children, and I just turned it over to God.
[03:45:33.780 --> 03:45:37.382]  I say, God, you know, I never ask God for anything.
[03:45:37.382 --> 03:45:39.002]  I say, Your will be done.
[03:45:39.002 --> 03:45:40.323]  Lead God and direct me.
[03:45:40.323 --> 03:45:41.043]  I'm not perfect.
[03:45:41.043 --> 03:45:42.344]  Just help me be a good person.
[03:45:42.344 --> 03:45:43.424]  Help me tell the truth.
[03:45:43.424 --> 03:45:44.505]  Give me discernment.
[03:45:44.505 --> 03:45:45.745]  Help me.
[03:45:45.745 --> 03:45:49.346]  But the one thing I broke down and asked God, I said, God, kill me.
[03:45:49.346 --> 03:45:50.387]  Have them kill me.
[03:45:50.387 --> 03:45:51.207]  Have them torture me.
[03:45:53.268 --> 03:45:56.089]  Please take me before anything happens to my children.
[03:45:56.089 --> 03:46:02.190]  But if something happens to my children, that is God's will, and that is the evil that's done this, and that is just the way it is.
[03:46:02.190 --> 03:46:06.350]  I will not give in to fear.
[03:46:06.350 --> 03:46:07.931]  That's what I say to you, sir.
[03:46:07.931 --> 03:46:08.331]  Go ahead.
[03:46:08.331 --> 03:46:10.611]  No, I think we're on the same page.
[03:46:10.611 --> 03:46:14.052]  My father had similar advice.
[03:46:14.052 --> 03:46:14.952]  I just wanted to thank you.
[03:46:14.952 --> 03:46:16.512]  You're a life force, sir.
[03:46:16.512 --> 03:46:20.913]  You give up the life force when you decide not to have children, when you counter the fear.
[03:46:21.894 --> 03:46:33.921]  You have to, you have, I mean, you know, most of our ancestors were born coming across on ships, you know, on the bottom of ships filled with crap and piss, and you know, rats everywhere, whether they were black slaves or white people.
[03:46:33.921 --> 03:46:37.284]  We've gone through adversity, we've been through it, it only makes us stronger.
[03:46:37.284 --> 03:46:38.144]  Okay?
[03:46:38.144 --> 03:46:47.170]  So, I mean, it's your decision to make, sir, but just be committed to work three or four jobs if you have to, and if you have those children, don't put them in the government brainwashing camp.
[03:46:47.170 --> 03:46:48.350]  Thanks very much, Alex.
[03:46:48.350 --> 03:46:49.151]  You guys got a hold of my dad?
[03:46:51.465 --> 03:46:52.706]  He always refuses to come on air.
[03:46:52.706 --> 03:46:53.647]  He's very shy.
[03:46:53.647 --> 03:47:01.633]  Is he going to call in and tell folks about he won't do it?
[03:47:01.633 --> 03:47:02.533]  Well, right.
[03:47:02.533 --> 03:47:02.934]  Whatever.
[03:47:02.934 --> 03:47:03.714]  Forget it.
[03:47:03.714 --> 03:47:05.175]  Whatever.
[03:47:05.175 --> 03:47:06.436]  Kalash in Germany.
[03:47:06.436 --> 03:47:07.477]  Kalash, you're on the air.
[03:47:07.477 --> 03:47:09.098]  Go ahead.
[03:47:09.098 --> 03:47:09.899]  Hello?
[03:47:09.899 --> 03:47:10.179]  Yes.
[03:47:10.179 --> 03:47:11.460]  Thanks for holding.
[03:47:11.460 --> 03:47:11.760]  Yes.
[03:47:11.760 --> 03:47:12.060]  Hello.
[03:47:12.060 --> 03:47:15.483]  First of all, I'm Kalash from Germany, originally from Iran.
[03:47:16.164 --> 03:47:20.107]  So I just want to give you tonight a point of view of Iranians from Iranians.
[03:47:20.107 --> 03:47:22.429]  I used to grow up here now for 20 years.
[03:47:22.429 --> 03:47:28.773]  I learned to behave like Germans, but the first thing I want to say, respect to you and to your staff.
[03:47:28.773 --> 03:47:30.454]  You're doing a great job for the world.
[03:47:30.454 --> 03:47:32.236]  You're doing a great job for the mankind.
[03:47:32.236 --> 03:47:36.038]  For me, you're not a bulldog or a shepherd, a German shepherd.
[03:47:36.038 --> 03:47:37.179]  You're a Prometheus.
[03:47:37.179 --> 03:47:45.125]  You're equal to Prometheus with your staff because you bring the ration and you bring everything back which is important for the good to live and to survive.
[03:47:46.093 --> 03:47:49.818]  First of all, Shah, I know your time is short, so I want to make it quick here.
[03:47:49.818 --> 03:47:52.962]  Just let me say some stuff about the point of view of the Iranians.
[03:47:52.962 --> 03:47:54.925]  I just want to start quick.
[03:47:54.925 --> 03:47:58.409]  In the 70s, when the revolution in Iran started, there was Shah.
[03:47:58.409 --> 03:47:59.150]  You remember him?
[03:47:59.150 --> 03:48:00.112]  He was a great person.
[03:48:00.726 --> 03:48:04.868]  And he was, at that time, talking about the new world order he was faced to.
[03:48:04.868 --> 03:48:08.170]  And he was one of the guys in Asia who said, I don't want to play this game.
[03:48:08.170 --> 03:48:12.433]  So they kidnapped him and gave him cancer and then they brought in the ayatollahs and it's all staged.
[03:48:12.433 --> 03:48:12.613]  Go ahead.
[03:48:12.613 --> 03:48:15.295]  You're so much intelligent, I know that you want to do that.
[03:48:15.295 --> 03:48:19.317]  So during these 30 years, Iran was prepared for these days.
[03:48:19.317 --> 03:48:20.718]  This regime, which is totally
[03:48:21.278 --> 03:48:24.439]  This regime is totally versus his own people.
[03:48:24.439 --> 03:48:37.063]  The people in Iran, 98% of the people in Iran are against this regime and 98% are even, maybe more, people are the same, have the same feelings like the people in the States.
[03:48:37.063 --> 03:48:47.147]  I was a lot of times in the States, I used to work there, I used to do my internship there, and it was a great time to talk to the people, no matter if it was a Chinese, Asian, black, white, they feel the same.
[03:48:47.620 --> 03:48:49.661]  Everywhere in the world, the people feel the same.
[03:48:49.661 --> 03:49:06.246]  Now it's the point to hold together, we people, with your help and with the help of other people, we have to put our hands together, and from information, get to the streets, and just make that nice, small revolution.
[03:49:06.246 --> 03:49:17.169]  There's one video that just came out this year, which is really important, I guess, for the understanding of everybody outside, especially for your listeners, for our friends outside, for the warriors, for the freedom,
[03:49:18.028 --> 03:49:20.389]  It is called Iran is not a problem.
[03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:34.053]  They have a website, it is called iranian, no it's called iranisnotaproblem.org and I beg everybody please check it out so you just know, you get some information about the history to the last 30 years.
[03:49:34.053 --> 03:49:38.915]  Globalists are threatened by any advanced intelligence society they don't control.
[03:49:38.915 --> 03:49:44.117]  So they blast the Iranians, they blast the Serbs, they go after anybody that isn't under their control.
[03:49:45.592 --> 03:49:46.233]  Exactly, sir.
[03:49:46.233 --> 03:49:52.517]  And you know, the problem which we face too is not even Iran and the local, the region Iran.
[03:49:52.517 --> 03:50:06.168]  Because the big war is going to the elite from Europe and USA, United States or Northern America versus the elite in Asia, which is under control of Russian and Chinese.
[03:50:06.168 --> 03:50:10.571]  The Indians play the same thing right now, the government, like the US government is telling them.
[03:50:10.571 --> 03:50:12.633]  So the big main problem is the elite
[03:50:12.993 --> 03:50:15.054]  In China and in Russia.
[03:50:15.054 --> 03:50:19.577]  Actually the fight is going on between them and we're just sitting in the middle of it.
[03:50:19.577 --> 03:50:20.258]  Sir, I hear you.
[03:50:20.258 --> 03:50:21.398]  Your phone's fading out.
[03:50:21.398 --> 03:50:22.099]  Good to hear from you.
[03:50:22.099 --> 03:50:23.279]  Call back again.
[03:50:23.279 --> 03:50:23.960]  Thanks for holding.
[03:50:23.960 --> 03:50:26.861]  We're going to come back and take a few final calls.
[03:50:26.861 --> 03:50:29.243]  I got really upset earlier because it just hits me.
[03:50:29.243 --> 03:50:38.368]  I can't just sit here day after day calmly talking about this when they just passed a mega-draft for women as well and they won't even say in the news what it is.
[03:50:38.368 --> 03:50:42.171]  They go, oh, a volunteer thing just passed and you read it and it says compulsory service.
[03:50:43.248 --> 03:50:45.550]  I mean, you know, and they're building death camps.
[03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:51.835]  I mean, I just... This doesn't have to happen if people will get up off their big, fat butts.
[03:50:53.387 --> 03:50:58.010]  They're big fat asses and do something about this.
[03:50:58.010 --> 03:50:58.931]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:58.931 --> 03:50:59.331]  Stay with me.
[03:50:59.331 --> 03:51:00.352]  I think I'm going into overdrive.
[03:51:00.352 --> 03:51:02.013]  I can feel it.
[03:51:02.013 --> 03:51:07.957]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:51:07.957 --> 03:51:12.740]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:51:12.740 --> 03:51:18.164]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:51:18.164 --> 03:51:21.606]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:51:22.086 --> 03:51:30.589]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:51:30.589 --> 03:51:36.392]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:51:36.392 --> 03:51:42.374]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:51:42.374 --> 03:51:44.695]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[03:51:45.055 --> 03:51:49.457]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:51:49.457 --> 03:51:55.600]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.221 --> 03:52:20.725]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.725 --> 03:52:22.686]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.686 --> 03:52:25.148]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.148 --> 03:52:36.035]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.337 --> 03:52:39.999]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.999 --> 03:52:41.861]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.861 --> 03:52:48.788]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:11.853]  Coming up in about an hour, Paul Watson's going to have a detailed report about national slavery passing the House and Senate.
[03:54:11.853 --> 03:54:19.897]  Going to that dirtbag president's desk, that wicked frontman.
[03:54:19.897 --> 03:54:21.978]  I'm not going to go into overdrive, I've got a bunch of stuff I've got to do.
[03:54:23.848 --> 03:54:26.830]  I'm going to make another Obama film, I'll tell you the name of it next week.
[03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:27.650]  It's going to be out July 4th.
[03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:30.252]  We're just going to continue to fight.
[03:54:30.252 --> 03:54:32.213]  People are waking up, people are fighting back.
[03:54:32.213 --> 03:54:33.634]  The enemy's put everything in high gear.
[03:54:33.634 --> 03:54:48.064]  Just look at all this intelligence, all this information I've got, and it's just, it's the worst possible, the attack configuration and the stated goals of these people is gun confiscation, mass shootouts with the police and military, just hell on earth for everybody.
[03:54:49.119 --> 03:54:51.482]  Except the elite, who've moved offshore to do this.
[03:54:51.482 --> 03:54:54.166]  They've all left the U.S., they're preparing to gut it completely.
[03:54:54.166 --> 03:54:57.770]  See, the globalists can move around doing that while they're outside the nation.
[03:54:57.770 --> 03:54:58.771]  And they're not going to get away with it.
[03:54:58.771 --> 03:55:00.373]  I'm going to fight this revolution, no doubt.
[03:55:00.373 --> 03:55:02.857]  They're probably going to set me up, kill me, arrest me, whatever.
[03:55:02.857 --> 03:55:05.059]  I just put it in God's hands.
[03:55:05.059 --> 03:55:06.401]  And, you know, that's the end of it.
[03:55:07.302 --> 03:55:10.424]  And I want to thank all of you out there for everything you're doing to fight these bastards.
[03:55:10.424 --> 03:55:12.025]  We're doing the best we can.

[03:55:30.939 --> 03:55:32.040]  Get aggressive.
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:32.800]  Get in the fight.
[03:55:32.800 --> 03:55:36.582]  Don't let the enemy coming in like this intimidate you.
[03:55:36.582 --> 03:55:38.543]  They're going to have our way with us if we don't fight them.
[03:55:38.543 --> 03:55:41.204]  You've got to fight a bully.
[03:55:41.204 --> 03:55:43.485]  You've got to fight a bully, folks.
[03:55:43.485 --> 03:55:44.546]  Michael in Florida.
[03:55:44.546 --> 03:55:45.266]  Michael, you're on the air.
[03:55:46.340 --> 03:55:51.743]  Alex, I'm sitting here and I'm looking at these state sovereignty resolutions from both New Hampshire and South Carolina.
[03:55:51.743 --> 03:56:00.129]  And they specifically enumerate requiring involuntary servitude or government service as a nullification of the Constitution.
[03:56:00.129 --> 03:56:01.930]  Now, my question to you is... It's high treason!
[03:56:01.930 --> 03:56:02.950]  It's high treason!
[03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:05.492]  It's high treason and it's tyranny of the highest order.
[03:56:05.492 --> 03:56:07.553]  This is America's Superman.
[03:56:07.553 --> 03:56:10.355]  This is gold kryptonite, folks.
[03:56:10.355 --> 03:56:13.037]  Everything they're doing is the opposite of goodness.
[03:56:13.037 --> 03:56:13.357]  Go ahead.
[03:56:14.346 --> 03:56:19.767]  Do you think the states are going to have the gumption and the gall to take action on these resolutions that they passed?
[03:56:19.767 --> 03:56:21.348]  They have the state police come in.
[03:56:21.348 --> 03:56:24.708]  They start threatening the legislatures.
[03:56:24.708 --> 03:56:28.369]  Some of them are passing it more, shooting it down, but it's only step one.
[03:56:28.369 --> 03:56:29.750]  But you made a good point.
[03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:32.690]  The states enumerated this from Obama's agenda.
[03:56:32.690 --> 03:56:37.952]  What is so scary is about half the Republicans are voting with them.
[03:56:37.952 --> 03:56:40.752]  Well, it's just blatant tyranny.
[03:56:40.752 --> 03:56:42.873]  I mean, this is 1860 all over again.
[03:56:42.873 --> 03:56:43.773]  Are we going to just
[03:56:44.591 --> 03:56:46.353]  Turn our backs on the citizens of the states?
[03:57:02.153 --> 03:57:03.354]  I'm just some average guy.
[03:57:03.354 --> 03:57:04.214]  It's all up to you.
[03:57:04.214 --> 03:57:09.897]  I need everybody to drop what they're doing, get the Obama deception, buy a thousand DVD copies, and get it out.
[03:57:09.897 --> 03:57:13.059]  Let me tell you, if you... they need a fake grassroots movement.
[03:57:13.059 --> 03:57:18.022]  If you'll turn it loose, the truth is more powerful than the lie, we will kick their ass.
[03:57:18.022 --> 03:57:25.326]  And I'm sorry I'm talking like that, but I am... I am literally... I'll tell you, I want to fight for freedom.
[03:57:25.326 --> 03:57:26.166]  I want to fight evil.
[03:57:26.166 --> 03:57:27.907]  And I feel like I could take on 20 people right now.
[03:57:27.907 --> 03:57:28.528]  You know that feeling?
[03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:37.181]  Well, I just want to say to any state legislatures, people that may be listening, you are elected by the people.
[03:57:37.181 --> 03:57:40.982]  It is your job to represent us and to protect our interests.
[03:57:40.982 --> 03:57:41.982]  Do your job.
[03:57:41.982 --> 03:57:46.903]  And when they try to do their job, they sick 13 million Obama bastards on them.
[03:57:46.903 --> 03:57:48.923]  Of course they do, but they need to stand up for them.
[03:57:48.923 --> 03:57:51.964]  They need to be... You can't let tyranny overwhelm you.
[03:57:51.964 --> 03:57:57.725]  Remember what the Constitution of the United States was about in the first place, and the Constitution of the state.
[03:57:57.725 --> 03:57:59.385]  The state created the federal government.
[03:57:59.912 --> 03:58:01.794]  The federal government is a child of the state.
[03:58:01.794 --> 03:58:03.915]  The child should not dictate to the parent.
[03:58:03.915 --> 03:58:04.696]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:58:04.696 --> 03:58:05.697]  Yeah, well, we're in the right.
[03:58:05.697 --> 03:58:06.417]  They're in the wrong.
[03:58:06.417 --> 03:58:07.938]  They've drawn first blood a million times.
[03:58:07.938 --> 03:58:09.079]  We know the score.
[03:58:09.079 --> 03:58:11.021]  Jason Bermos will be back live 9 to midnight tonight.
[03:58:11.021 --> 03:58:12.162]  I'm going to sit in with you.
[03:58:12.162 --> 03:58:13.883]  I'm not going to do retransmission right now.
[03:58:13.883 --> 03:58:15.364]  I mean, I'm not going to do any overdrive.
[03:58:15.364 --> 03:58:17.946]  We'll go to retransmission at Infowars.com.
[03:58:17.946 --> 03:58:19.327]  Listen to me.
[03:58:19.327 --> 03:58:22.270]  No one is reporting that it's compulsory service.
[03:58:22.270 --> 03:58:23.410]  They've passed it.
[03:58:23.410 --> 03:58:26.193]  The New York Times and AP are deceiving the people.
[03:58:26.193 --> 03:58:28.574]  In one hour, Paul Watson's got the article launching.
[03:58:29.375 --> 03:58:30.657]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.817 --> 03:58:53.498]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.498 --> 03:58:58.260]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.260 --> 03:59:01.201]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.201 --> 03:59:04.262]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.262 --> 03:59:10.105]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.325 --> 03:59:13.570]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.570 --> 03:59:20.580]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.580 --> 03:59:23.864]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
