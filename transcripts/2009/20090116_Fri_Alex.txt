[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.670]  That's at SuperiorLifeWater.com.
[00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.190]  That's SuperiorLifeWater.com.
[00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.691]  What's in your water?
[00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:12.552]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.213]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:32.647]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:43.146]  And before we go to author and activist Peter Dale Scott, I just want to remind you guys to support our sponsors here in the InfoWar.
[00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:46.113]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:47.414]  I mean, it's really simple, folks.
[00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:49.274]  Solar energy cuts your electric bill.
[00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:51.335]  It's something we believe in here.
[00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.215]  MySolarBackup.com will help you get started.
[00:00:54.915 --> 00:01:04.418]  People like Jesse Ventura, who live in Mexico six months out of the year, they heat their entire home, use all their electric through solar panels.
[00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.458]  They only use the most minimal amount of energy, and that's what we're trying to do.
[00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:11.119]  We're trying to get independence from the power companies, from the system.
[00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.080]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.103]  Alright, we have a very distinguished guest.
[00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:21.749]  I was actually lucky enough to interview him while I was hosting the Alex Jones Show over the summer this year.
[00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.176]  He's the author of many books and his latest article is Marshall Law, The Financial Bailout and War.
[00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:28.457]  It's Peter Dale Scott.
[00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:29.378]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:30.720]  I'm glad to be back.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.421]  Hi there.
[00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:33.786]  Well, let's just get right into it.
[00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:54.399]  I mean, in the very beginning of this article, you not only talk about Paulson and the bailout there, but you also talk about how Congress was strong-armed into initially passing this, because the initial bailout did fail, and then it was re-proposed, and after a few members, including Inhofe and Sherman, were threatened with martial law, it magically passed, didn't it, Peter?
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.043]  Yes, well, there was an atmosphere of threat used on Congress.
[00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:06.702]  I think that the bailout was ill-advised, certainly in the form that it was.
[00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:11.583]  And, of course, the excuse that was used was that they had to act immediately.
[00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:30.186]  But I think a test of what is really bad about this bailout law is that it's a means for taking public funds and giving them to enrich the rich after they had made very disastrous investments, which went sour.
[00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:36.801]  Instead of moral hazard applying and they're having to pay for it, we are stepping in to pay.
[00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:39.843]  And it may be that something like this has to be done.
[00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:53.230]  But it should have been done with restraints, for example, to tell them that they can't go on paying these outrageous bonuses for their misdeeds, that they cannot continue to distribute dividends.
[00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.773]  You know, 85% of the stock in this country is owned by the richest 10% in the country.
[00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:13.557]  If you pass a public law to guarantee the continuation of dividends to banks, which in fact are losing money badly, you're using the public treasury to enrich the rich.
[00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:20.763]  And that's a symptom of what's really wrong in this country, I think, that wealth has taken control of both parties.
[00:03:21.484 --> 00:03:26.148]  And it was the influence of wealth that drove that legislation through.
[00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:47.744]  And it's, of course, just happening again right now, and it's not quite over because, once again, it will go into conference committee, and I think this time they're intending to cut off bonuses and intending to cut off dividends, but I think we should watch very closely to see if this actually happens when the final bill is signed.
[00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:52.886]  Well, there's definitely some political grandstanding now going on as the administrations are about to switch.
[00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:58.587]  I mean, now for the first time I'm seeing the media report, conservatives ask if bailout is unconstitutional.
[00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:01.268]  And I would say, yes, it's absolutely unconstitutional.
[00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:11.170]  But now the mainstream is going to make this into a right-left argument, especially with the House Democrats now proposing a $825 billion stimulus bill.
[00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.691]  I mean, is there any end in sight to these bailout packages, to these stimulus bills?
[00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:17.772]  I mean, what do you see happening in the next six months?
[00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:24.854]  Well, I think I've always been uninclined to predict the future.
[00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:43.751]  I think it's an easy way to make big mistakes, but particularly right now, we really are going into, you know, people point back to the depression of the 1930s as an example of where we've been before.
[00:04:44.358 --> 00:05:00.786]  But I think we're possibly in an even worse crisis than we were then, and one thing for sure is that America's profile in the world is greater than it was, so that the world will suffer more acutely.
[00:05:01.987 --> 00:05:10.952]  Yes, the short answer to your question is, absolutely, there's going to be more and more bailing out, trillions of dollars, people have estimated up to $8.5 trillion.
[00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:17.539]  Some of it will be done through Congress, and a lot of it already has been done.
[00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:29.909]  A trillion or more has been done through the Federal Reserve, and people should understand that what the Federal Reserve does is using our money, but they don't go to Congress.
[00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:38.496]  They're using the powers that were granted them decades ago, and it's completely secret.
[00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:39.977]  There's no accountability.
[00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:53.796]  And you get the irony that Bloomberg, who's a billionaire, his company is suing the Federal Reserve to force them to say what they've been doing with our money.
[00:05:53.836 --> 00:06:03.463]  And you really have reached a point where it's no longer democracy, it's taxation without representation going on through the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:03.923 --> 00:06:07.586]  So they're left, right, and center in every direction.
[00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:11.968]  Treatment of the banks, treatment of the big multinational corporations.
[00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:17.712]  We're going to see huge bailouts with a minimum of control.
[00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:24.337]  And I think all we can do from outside is to insist that here are the things that we should insist on.
[00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:27.259]  One, as much transparency as possible.
[00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:31.342]  There was really no transparency in the first bailout, Paulson's bailout.
[00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:35.725]  And what I think is a vital criterion is
[00:06:36.297 --> 00:06:49.228]  Democracy is suffering right now because we're getting, for about 30 years now, we've been getting rapidly increasing disparity between wealth and poverty in this country.
[00:06:49.288 --> 00:07:03.401]  The rich, there are ways of measuring this, and America has become, of all the Western countries, probably the leading example of extreme disparity between wealth and poverty.
[00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:16.460]  And the criterion that should be applied to every law that's passed and all these bailouts is, will it diminish the disparity of wealth and income in this country, or will it increase it?
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.941]  And if it increases it, it's a bad law.
[00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:29.866]  And that, I think, is something, it's a sign of the problem that this obvious criterion has hardly been invoked.
[00:07:30.882 --> 00:07:34.284]  It has come up, I think, with the auto industry.
[00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:52.511]  I think it's perfectly obvious that if you're going to ask the workers to accept less in their paycheck, then you should ask the people who probably are being overpaid at the top to accept less too, particularly because it was their failure of leadership that led into this crisis.
[00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:53.632]  Does that not make sense?
[00:07:54.187 --> 00:08:18.733]  I absolutely agree with you, and it's just disgusting how, you know, like you said, the upper echelon continue to rake in the bonuses, still have these massive salaries and the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars in most cases, and like you said, it's going to be the common worker who loses his pension, who loses his 401k, who loses his benefits, and may not even have a job, because I really don't see the auto industry surviving another year in this country.
[00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.253]  We don't make anything left.
[00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:21.774]  There's nothing we make in this country.
[00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:22.774]  The last thing was cars.
[00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:24.095]  And that's about to end.
[00:08:24.415 --> 00:08:26.516]  And going back to what you said... How great is that?
[00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.116]  I think we're pretty good in high-tech.
[00:08:28.576 --> 00:08:29.117]  Well, that's true.
[00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:35.940]  We've outsourced a lot of it, but the central leadership of that industry is... Yeah, but most of it's still built in India or China.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:36.820]  Yes.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:48.365]  A lot of the jobs have gone, but the... America is... You know, now we're talking about something that's been happening over 50 years, and that is that
[00:08:49.352 --> 00:09:02.001]  We've put so much emphasis on maintaining our military that we've allowed civilian industry and the civilian economy to migrate to other countries.
[00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:12.889]  One of the things we have to say about this bailout is that the crisis it faced should have been faced much earlier.
[00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:38.989]  And worse than that, the states addressed the problem of predatory lending, which is at the heart of it, because here were very unscrupulous companies going out and hard-selling mortgages to people who they knew couldn't sustain them, particularly because these were variable mortgages that would start with a very reasonable rate, which they intended
[00:09:39.574 --> 00:09:43.878]  To jack up to 11, 12, 15% usurious rates.
[00:09:44.258 --> 00:09:59.751]  They knew that this was all a phony operation and that this is where the big banks are culpable because they, uh, the, uh, first of all, they lobbied for Congress to make it easier to do this sort of thing for them to invest in it.
[00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:05.616]  And then they packaged all these mortgages into securities, which they sold all over the world.
[00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:15.194]  So that's why we have a world crisis now based on the failure and the downturn in the American housing market.
[00:10:15.854 --> 00:10:32.228]  Little innocent countries like Iceland, who have done no wrong to anybody, are suffering terribly because the banking system of the world has supported this bubble and now is having to pay for it everywhere, every part of the world.
[00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:35.364]  There's one other thing.
[00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:46.188]  You could easily, in legislation, establish a principle of some kind of ratio between the richest return and the poorest in any business.
[00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:58.972]  If a worker in an industry is getting, I don't know, shall we say 30,000 a year, you establish a limit, maybe 20 times that, which would be the maximum
[00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:01.966]  That anybody in that industry can make.
[00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:08.888]  And this has been kicked around for some years as a solution to the problem of disparity of income.
[00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:19.292]  But I'm not sure that our two parties that are so heavily subsidized by the wealthy are going to put that into legislation.
[00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:19.992]  But they should.
[00:11:20.252 --> 00:11:27.495]  So just say 20 times as much as the basic pay is the most that anybody can make in any industry.
[00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:28.435]  Is that not reasonable?
[00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:35.368]  It seems reasonable to guys like you and me, but to the global elite, that's going to cut into their profit margin quite a bit.
[00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:37.028]  Yeah, it scares them, exactly.
[00:11:37.349 --> 00:11:49.172]  And that's what we learned in the bailout last fall, is how vigorously they fought to maintain their bonuses and maintain their dividends.
[00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.678]  Even though they're lucky not to be in jail, some of those people.
[00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:56.865]  And some of them actually still, not just Madoff, but a number of other people.
[00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:57.947]  I think they're super lucky.
[00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:58.869]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:01.192]  We'll be back with Peter Dale Scott, Infowars.com.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.262]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:15.684]  Obviously, you have the perfect gift in mind.

[00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:01.050]  Or call 702-453-7455.
[00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.591]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:14.055]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:16.196]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:18.112]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:18.593 --> 00:13:19.113]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:19.393 --> 00:13:20.374]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:21.696]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:23.398]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:30.505]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:31.346]  Some U.S.
[00:13:31.386 --> 00:13:37.032]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:37.732 --> 00:13:41.233]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:44.034]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:09.175]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:09.376 --> 00:14:09.756]  January 16, 2009.
[00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:10.897]  Gold opened this morning at $832.90.
[00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:14.040]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $857.72, $428.86 for the half-ounce, and $214.43 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.440]  That's $857.72, $428.86, and $214.43.
[00:14:25.245 --> 00:14:37.647]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:14:37.747 --> 00:14:40.848]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:44.228]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:14:44.288 --> 00:14:47.149]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:50.129]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:50.429]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.949]  Unlike your liberty,
[00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.252]  The paper is free.
[00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:58.057]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:58.277 --> 00:15:01.964]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:02.184]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:09.717]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:15.019]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.540]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:24.984]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:15:25.204 --> 00:15:30.927]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:32.889]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:35.111]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:15:35.131 --> 00:15:39.496]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:15:39.676 --> 00:15:41.818]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:48.845]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:49.546]  Thank you.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.024]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:18.789]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:19.652]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:21.016]  I've been sitting in all week.
[00:16:21.256 --> 00:16:21.858]  I'm a filmmaker.
[00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:26.291]  Put together Loose Change, Final Cut, and of course Fabled Enemies.
[00:16:26.311 --> 00:16:31.534]  You can get both of those as well as all of Alex Jones' titles over at Infowars.com.
[00:16:31.614 --> 00:16:34.316]  And we're talking bailout with Peter Dale Scott.
[00:16:34.336 --> 00:16:35.677]  We're also talking the Federal Reserve.
[00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:39.900]  And I want to remind people that the Federal Reserve is an independent organization.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:50.007]  I mean, you can watch Alan Greenspan on PBS actually tout that, oh, we're independent of the federal government and actually we have no oversight and we're really above the president in many respects.
[00:16:50.387 --> 00:16:52.969]  And if you see how the Federal Reserve works, the board,
[00:16:53.849 --> 00:17:10.539]  And correct me if I'm wrong, Peter, but I believe that you vote for your, you're a constituent, you vote for your congressmen, your senators, and things like that, but those people are the ones who actually decide who's going to be on the board of the Federal Reserve, and they serve, I want to say, what is it, 13?
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.942]  No, it's 13 members, and what do they serve, eight-year terms?
[00:17:14.982 --> 00:17:19.325]  Yes, it's a considered way
[00:17:20.186 --> 00:17:23.648]  of preventing people, people just printing money.
[00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:42.676]  The idea of it is, and by the way, you do get something like this in England and in France, because they're frightened of democracy cheapening money, because obviously, I don't know what the right solution here is.
[00:17:43.097 --> 00:17:45.778]  I'm not as frightened
[00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:52.082]  My real fear is not the particular individuals who are in the Federal Reserve.
[00:17:52.162 --> 00:18:07.594]  My fear is of the influence of the wealthy in this country, which works through the Fed, it works through the Treasury Department, it works very much through the CIA, and that's actually been my specialty over these years.
[00:18:07.694 --> 00:18:11.677]  You know, at the beginning, the CIA was sort of planned on Wall Street,
[00:18:12.393 --> 00:18:24.903]  And all the first directors, or practically all the first directors and deputy directors, were taken en masse from Wall Street law firms and Wall Street investment companies.
[00:18:26.124 --> 00:18:33.630]  And that bias, in terms of preserving wealth, has affected our foreign policy since the war.
[00:18:34.431 --> 00:18:38.114]  It wasn't totally evil at the beginning, but
[00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:52.058]  Ever since America started having to tighten its belt, which is roughly at the end of the Vietnam War, it's been done in such a way as to protect the rich and let somebody else pay.
[00:18:52.218 --> 00:19:05.929]  And what we've seen from this is declining income in the third world, which of course leads to increased violence in the third world, and declining income, real income, not just what
[00:19:06.668 --> 00:19:14.971]  The numbers on a paycheck, but real income has been declining for the working class in this country, and increasingly now for the middle class as well.
[00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:35.439]  And that's why I say, you know, you've had this bubble, this financial bubble, that is being, in a sense, extracting wealth out of the body politic, depositing it in the bank accounts of the rich, and now the bailouts are still, in a sense, trying to preserve that particular relationship.
[00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:44.243]  We've got to talk about martial law and war in this program, but I really am, of course, very wound up about this influence as well.
[00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:46.579]  Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to move into.
[00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:49.001]  You know, martial law, the financial bailout, and more.
[00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:51.322]  Where does martial law fit into all this?
[00:19:51.402 --> 00:19:58.948]  Not only were they threatened with martial law, but we have an Obama administration that says that they're going to redistribute troops into Afghanistan.
[00:19:59.048 --> 00:20:06.414]  Obviously there's tensions not only in Gaza and Israel, but Pakistan is now more and more, you know, showing up on the media as the enemy.
[00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:10.858]  I mean, is martial law here at home something that we should really be worried about?
[00:20:11.976 --> 00:20:18.821]  Preparations for martial law have been increasing constantly for the last 30 years.
[00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:27.847]  It really goes back to the troubles back in the 1960s and 1970s when there was a case, actually.
[00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:40.656]  I think I approved of calling out the troops in places like Detroit because the federal troops were not as racist as the local police and were more efficient in restoring order.
[00:20:41.294 --> 00:20:49.361]  But, traditionally in this country, as I'm sure most of the audience know, you only use federal troops in an extreme emergency.
[00:20:49.401 --> 00:21:02.472]  We have Posse Comitatus Acts dating back to Reconstruction after the Civil War, which forbid the use of troops in a normal way in police activities.
[00:21:03.313 --> 00:21:07.076]  And that's been undermined now since the early 1980s by secret planning
[00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:31.217]  By a committee that was set up under the Reagan administration, and for twenty years it kept on going, and two of the chief people in the planning, not the only ones, were Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, and they were planning for what was in effect called the suspension of the American Constitution.
[00:21:31.677 --> 00:21:34.558]  First of all, in an atomic attack.
[00:21:35.174 --> 00:21:42.719]  But what the extraordinary thing was, they took planning against an atomic attack and applied it to normal police activity.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.681]  And that's what we're getting today.
[00:21:45.141 --> 00:21:49.404]  We'll be back with Peter Dale Scott, martial law, the financial bailout, and more.
[00:21:49.424 --> 00:21:50.485]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:50.525 --> 00:21:56.709]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.731]  We're on the march.
[00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:00.832]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:04.475]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:10.360]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.681]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[00:22:11.701 --> 00:22:15.864]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[00:22:15.884 --> 00:22:20.469]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function, or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[00:22:20.709 --> 00:22:30.938]  The Sinuplus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[00:22:30.998 --> 00:22:31.518]  We're good to go.
[00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:13.464]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:23:13.704 --> 00:23:15.045]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:16.806]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:23.469]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:30.793]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:32.634]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:39.779]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:43.141]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:43.242 --> 00:23:48.465]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:23:49.006 --> 00:23:51.648]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:52.088 --> 00:23:58.873]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:09.333]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:24:09.633 --> 00:24:10.773]  eFoods does it again.
[00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:15.776]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:24:16.116 --> 00:24:20.418]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:24:32.193 --> 00:24:32.555]  I think so.
[00:24:38.626 --> 00:24:40.167]  It's easy to fix and ready to go.
[00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:42.648]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:24:42.688 --> 00:24:47.792]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[00:24:48.272 --> 00:24:49.333]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:24:49.513 --> 00:24:51.894]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:24:51.914 --> 00:24:53.095]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:54.696]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:25:17.998 --> 00:25:18.859]  All right, we're back.
[00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:20.140]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:28.708]  We're live right now, streaming video over at PrisonPlanet.tv, and we're talking to Peter Dale Scott, author of The War Conspiracy and many other books.
[00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:32.172]  I think that was actually a banned book for quite some time.
[00:25:32.192 --> 00:25:34.014]  He coined the term parapolitics.
[00:25:34.614 --> 00:25:40.415]  And we were just talking about the continuity of government program often referred to as the shadow government.
[00:25:40.455 --> 00:25:47.337]  You were talking about how it was revamped in the 80s, or I'm sorry, in the 80s under Reagan.
[00:25:47.637 --> 00:25:56.699]  And what I found in my research, and I have a little part of it in Fabled Enemies, is in the late 80s, early 90s, the National Programs Office took over the COG.
[00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:05.725]  So, to carry it on, at the end of the G. H. W. Bush administration, the New York Times ran an article and said that there was no more atomic, you know, with the
[00:26:25.393 --> 00:26:31.619]  Disappearance of the Soviet Union, they were no longer so frightened of an atomic attack, so they were winding up these programs.
[00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:49.776]  It was a very misleading article, because what had happened was that they had shifted the planning from an atomic focus to just any emergency, and one of the last acts of the Reagan administration was to pass an executive order that
[00:26:50.635 --> 00:26:51.555]  I don't think so.
[00:27:15.568 --> 00:27:20.891]  Neither Cheney nor Rumsfeld had anything to do with the government.
[00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:24.353]  Each of them was a CEO of a major corporation.
[00:27:24.954 --> 00:27:38.583]  But the planning continued and the Army has... One of the last troops of the Clinton administration was a new directive for the Army which legitimized the
[00:27:39.236 --> 00:27:48.478]  idea that the army would permanently have what they call a co-op, a continuity of operations program in the army.
[00:27:49.278 --> 00:28:00.681]  For the first time, instead, the people who had worried about an attack from abroad would now worry from an attack at home from violence of any form.
[00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:06.983]  And right after 9-11, we got a whole series of things, which I'm sure were
[00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:09.275]  We're good to go.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.602]  Ready for combat in the United States.
[00:28:35.682 --> 00:28:39.005]  This is entirely, entirely unprecedented.
[00:28:39.646 --> 00:28:47.453]  And it's been announced that this is probably, you know, they announced it in connection with the inauguration.
[00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:53.939]  And we've seen since then, the troops are now in Washington, controlling Washington.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.642]  But this is not an ad hoc thing.
[00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:58.944]  This is a permanent thing under this new order.
[00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.573]  Absolutely, and you know what?
[00:29:00.593 --> 00:29:12.008]  Let's play the clip of Obama before he's elected, talking about a civilian security force, and he's openly said that he's going to bring 20,000 troops into the United States for domestic operations.
[00:29:12.228 --> 00:29:13.009]  Let's play that clip.
[00:29:15.512 --> 00:29:22.655]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:30.519]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:29:32.492 --> 00:29:46.351]  Alright, so, you know, it really does seem like, again, these are continuations that you see, whether it's Republican or Democrat, just like you said, began with Reagan, into the Bush 1 administration, continuity of government plans were then
[00:29:47.332 --> 00:29:47.992]  You're right.
[00:30:13.402 --> 00:30:19.326]  Yeah, yeah, and most people scoff at the idea of this shadow government, and it was on the cover of the Washington Times.
[00:30:19.766 --> 00:30:24.269]  So I see only more expansion on this COG-type program.
[00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:34.835]  I don't think it's a coincidence that this week is when we saw the 9-11 Commission release over 1,200 transcripts of interviews at the end of the Bush administration, so they couldn't be ridiculed.
[00:30:35.195 --> 00:30:40.619]  I'm sure that researchers... Well, if you looked at that schedule, almost half of them are still withheld.
[00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:41.259]  Yes.
[00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:43.781]  They're releasing them, but not really releasing them.
[00:30:44.141 --> 00:30:46.042]  Yes, someone still has clearances on them.
[00:30:46.082 --> 00:30:47.663]  They say, oh, well, national security clearance.
[00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:54.888]  It's going to take legislation to get all of that stuff cleared, and I don't have much confidence that this Congress will do it.
[00:30:54.968 --> 00:31:09.857]  But I would certainly, I think it's, you know, if we're revamping the whole of our constitutional arrangement in this country because of this largest murder, certainly in the history of the United States,
[00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:25.538]  At least investigated, and we still don't know, and we can't even see... You know, after the Kennedy assassination, you had the Warren Commission, which essentially covered things up, but at least it had the decency to publish its evidence.
[00:31:26.198 --> 00:31:35.503]  And we're going to need legislation to force the evidence, whatever it was, from the 9-11 Commission released.
[00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.452]  Let me tell you the thing that worries me most about Obama.
[00:31:40.492 --> 00:31:43.653]  We had an election where we had a choice.
[00:31:44.994 --> 00:31:57.400]  The parties gave us a choice between a candidate, McCain, who wanted to fight two wars, and a candidate, Obama, who, by the way, I mean, I could say good things about Obama on this program.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:03.023]  I'm not totally hostile to him by any means, except when it came to Afghanistan.
[00:32:03.798 --> 00:32:07.901]  And when he was talking about Iraq, this is what he had to say.
[00:32:08.522 --> 00:32:18.110]  I'm quoting now from his website, "...the scale of our deployments in Iraq continues to set back our ability to finish the fight in Afghanistan."
[00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:31.240]  Well, it's very clear since then that Obama means to not just to fight in Afghanistan, but to escalate in Afghanistan, and I think you've already said that
[00:32:31.638 --> 00:32:38.241]  That's a war which is going nowhere, and our presence is making things worse, not better.
[00:32:39.342 --> 00:32:47.165]  And any sane person looking at that war knows that you're even thinking of trying to finish it.
[00:32:48.106 --> 00:32:49.866]  First of all, you're not going to succeed.
[00:32:49.946 --> 00:32:50.847]  The Russians didn't.
[00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:51.807]  The British didn't.
[00:32:52.327 --> 00:32:54.689]  Nobody has ever succeeded in doing this.
[00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:57.650]  But if you're going to try, you're going to have to put
[00:32:58.342 --> 00:33:01.523]  There are vastly more troops there than there are now.
[00:33:02.264 --> 00:33:13.949]  We are destabilizing Pakistan, which is one of the shakiest constitutional governments in the region, and is one with nuclear weapons.
[00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:24.313]  So what we are doing has increased the chances that Islamic fundamentalists may end up with a state of Pakistan and nuclear weapons to boot.
[00:33:25.432 --> 00:33:32.326]  This is where I think Obama needs to be reined in, and I don't see that coming from Congress.
[00:33:32.918 --> 00:33:44.027]  No, I don't see that either, and I see it as a redistribution of forces, getting people out of an unpopular war in Iraq, only to put them into Afghanistan and create the same kind of quagmire situation.
[00:33:44.407 --> 00:33:46.168]  So we still have our presence in the Middle East.
[00:33:46.208 --> 00:33:49.811]  I mean, to me, this is really about building a Eurasian Union.
[00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:55.135]  It's what the PNAC guys talked about in Rebuilding America's Defenses, and having a presence there.
[00:33:55.736 --> 00:33:59.558]  I feel like Iran is probably the most unstable block there, but they haven't been able to
[00:34:00.419 --> 00:34:04.200]  Really propagate a reason for us to go in there with the American people.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.700]  You know, again, Pakistan's being demonized at the moment.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:13.682]  You know, most people in this country are still behind a war in Afghanistan and Iraq because they still think the boogeyman Osama Bin Laden is out there.
[00:34:13.722 --> 00:34:18.423]  They just reiterated that by putting out an audio tape of him taking the Palestinian plight.
[00:34:18.443 --> 00:34:28.345]  So anybody who disagrees with Israeli force on the Gaza Strip is automatically, you know, associated with the deepest, darkest villain there is out there.
[00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.226]  I don't see us leaving, Peter.
[00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:32.867]  I see us being there.
[00:34:32.907 --> 00:34:57.425]  Well, I think, eventually, I see us losing and leaving like Vietnam, but it took, you know, it took a decade, really, after America realized it couldn't win before the Vietnam War was over, and an awful lot of people died, and even Americans died under Nixon, who won on the campaign of ending the war.
[00:34:58.197 --> 00:35:09.181]  So, we're used to presidents who campaign on ending the war, who make things worse, and yes, I fear it here.
[00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:17.444]  I don't, by the way, I'm not accusing Obama of being a cynic who is out to deceive the American people.
[00:35:17.564 --> 00:35:20.605]  I just see him as somebody hedged in by these forces.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.901]  Who want that war.
[00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:33.344]  The underlying fact is that American oil companies have now invested a great deal in the oil and gas of Central Asia.
[00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:37.486]  And they need ways of getting it out.
[00:35:37.686 --> 00:35:41.007]  And they have one insecure pipeline going through Georgia.
[00:35:41.047 --> 00:35:44.068]  And we saw the trouble there last fall.
[00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:50.090]  And they would like very much to have a gas and an oil pipeline through Afghanistan.
[00:35:51.273 --> 00:35:53.474]  It's not going to happen by putting U.S.
[00:35:53.534 --> 00:35:59.478]  troops there, because that is just increasing the tension in the country.
[00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:05.983]  And, you know, the P-Net goal has been bought by the U.S.
[00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:06.363]  Army.
[00:36:06.784 --> 00:36:13.529]  Their stated mission is full-spectrum dominance in the world, and part of that is this
[00:36:14.837 --> 00:36:26.026]  Continuity of Operations mission for the Army here is to have full spectrum dominance in the United States, because obviously if you want to dominate the world, you're going to have to dominate this country too.
[00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:37.175]  And these are still things that are not fully implemented, and what the people listening to this program have to do is to alert their friends and their neighbors
[00:36:37.867 --> 00:36:40.051]  That, you know, the real role of the U.S.
[00:36:40.151 --> 00:36:42.856]  Army is to protect the American people.
[00:36:43.016 --> 00:36:45.641]  It is not to control the American people.
[00:36:45.721 --> 00:36:49.949]  That's a revolutionary change and it should be challenged and it should be stopped.
[00:36:50.623 --> 00:36:51.784]  I absolutely agree with you there.
[00:36:52.664 --> 00:36:56.446]  My question is, do you think that conscription could actually happen under this administration?
[00:36:56.826 --> 00:37:03.549]  Tom Blankley, editor over at the Washington Times, has been parading around the media now for the last few years talking about conscription.
[00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:10.852]  I've got a clip of him on Pat Buchanan's MSNBC show, where he's talking about it in the summer of 07, saying, well, the time for that debate
[00:37:11.372 --> 00:37:13.893]  Isn't now, it'll be under a new administration.
[00:37:14.513 --> 00:37:17.754]  Lo and behold, we get that new administration in a week before they're inaugurated.
[00:37:17.794 --> 00:37:29.157]  The same guy, Blankly, puts out a book called American Grit, where again, he's calling for conscription of 18 to 25 year olds, three months in a boot camp, and two years mandatory service.
[00:37:29.257 --> 00:37:33.918]  And this is echoed by Obama's new chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.
[00:37:33.958 --> 00:37:37.319]  He was just on C-SPAN over the summer talking about this same program.
[00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:38.559]  Is it going to happen?
[00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:40.240]  Is there a possibility of it happening here?
[00:37:40.902 --> 00:37:53.367]  Well, again, I'm reluctant to predict, because the big block to it happening is that we will go back to the America of the 1960s and you will have a new anti-war movement.
[00:37:53.967 --> 00:38:04.251]  And this was the big issue when America went into Iraq in 2003, and the generals were absolutely right.
[00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:05.431]  It should have been done with 500,000 troops.
[00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:17.955]  And Rumsfeld said, that's ridiculous, we can use our new sophisticated weapons and win it quickly with only 120,000.
[00:38:18.015 --> 00:38:21.838]  And of course, he was wrong.
[00:38:22.218 --> 00:38:28.283]  But the reason that they didn't want to go to 500,000 troops is that they would have needed to have a draft for that.
[00:38:29.044 --> 00:38:32.466]  And that's why I'm not going to predict that we'll get a draft.
[00:38:32.546 --> 00:38:34.208]  We're going to get people who say,
[00:38:34.821 --> 00:39:03.597]  If you want to maintain all these missions, you're going to have to have a draft, and particularly because one thing is certain is that Iraq has had very negative impact on recruitment for the army, but the civilian people are very terrified of creating a situation where, once again, they are forcing young Americans to protect themselves by getting involved in the anti-war movement.
[00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.430]  Peter, where can people get your information?
[00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.811]  I know you write for 911truth.org a lot, and you're on blogging.
[00:39:09.831 --> 00:39:13.012]  I have my own website.
[00:39:13.673 --> 00:39:14.833]  I used to put things in it.
[00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:32.758]  Now it's mostly just connection to... I've written quite a lot of articles on the internet recently, and my own website is basically just a kind of gateway to going into... it's hot-linked to all these other articles.
[00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:34.976]  Uh, be careful listening to this.
[00:39:35.056 --> 00:39:37.759]  It's simple, but it's important to get it right.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:53.676]  www.peterdalescott.net Or, if you want, you could do .org, but do not do peterdalescott.com because that's a hostile network, and so please remember peterdalescott.net.
[00:39:54.588 --> 00:39:56.770]  Basically just attackers trying to use your good name?
[00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.232]  It's a funny, I don't quite know what it is.
[00:39:59.252 --> 00:40:05.238]  PeterDalescott.com was opened up in Kenya by a company that's now in Belize.
[00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:11.364]  The only things it has on it that have anything to do with me are negative reviews of my books.
[00:40:13.101 --> 00:40:17.383]  Yeah, how dare you try to expose light on the darkness over the past 30 to 40 years.
[00:40:17.403 --> 00:40:18.743]  You've been at this forever, haven't you?
[00:40:18.763 --> 00:40:20.564]  I mean, literally 30 or 40 years.
[00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:40.692]  Well, the Vietnam War started, and then because of that I saw a connection between the Vietnam War and... It really happened after Kennedy was assassinated, so I got drawn into that, and again, you know, I don't think we'll ever really have a chance of rational government in this country until
[00:40:41.385 --> 00:40:50.552]  People on high admit that Kennedy wasn't just killed by a disgruntled ex-Marine called Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:40:50.672 --> 00:41:00.520]  Everybody knows it, but officially that even, you know, Nixon said that the Warren Report was the biggest scam, biggest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.642]  That's on one of the tapes we've got out of the White House.
[00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:08.986]  But officially, of course, it's still the official doctrine that Lee Harvey Oswald did it.
[00:41:09.186 --> 00:41:10.067]  He acted alone.
[00:41:10.552 --> 00:41:15.654]  And with 9-11, 19 crazy Arabs did it and they acted alone.
[00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:25.418]  You look at one of these, what I call deep events, deep events, the ones which we know there's more to it than meets the eye.
[00:41:26.418 --> 00:41:35.722]  I'm struck how much continuity of modus operandi there is between the Kennedy assassination and 9-11.
[00:41:36.886 --> 00:41:43.267]  And I have references to those articles that are on the internet that you can get through my website.
[00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:52.466]  Yeah, there definitely does seem to be a lot of interplayers, players involved in both the Kennedy assassination and 9-11 as well.
[00:41:52.726 --> 00:41:58.510]  And, you know, in the mainstream media, at least last week, they were saying, oh, 9-11 conspiracy theorists might be right.
[00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:04.894]  There's this new document where this mob boss takes entire credit through an FBI asset for the Kennedy assassination.
[00:42:04.914 --> 00:42:10.577]  Well, a mob boss couldn't call the Secret Service off the car, and you can see that in the video.
[00:42:10.597 --> 00:42:11.278]  So, obviously,
[00:42:11.598 --> 00:42:14.861]  He couldn't have planned the parade route, is the most obvious thing.
[00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:26.793]  The Bob Boss of Carlos Marcello, he could not have planned the parade route through Dallas, which took this unexplained little detour to go underneath the Texas School Book Depository.
[00:42:28.089 --> 00:42:32.371]  And again, he couldn't have called off those two Secret Service agents, and you can see that right in the video.
[00:42:32.431 --> 00:42:36.173]  Folks, come on, this is a government blackout from start to finish.
[00:42:36.993 --> 00:42:40.515]  Use some mob players to get rid of some people, to provide cover.
[00:42:40.535 --> 00:42:43.976]  You know, don't buy it if the mainstream media is putting it out there.
[00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:45.097]  Look into it for yourself.
[00:42:45.557 --> 00:42:47.317]  Final segment with Peter Dale Scott.
[00:42:47.938 --> 00:42:48.958]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:49.038 --> 00:42:52.180]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and TruthNews.us.
[00:43:07.503 --> 00:43:12.327]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system new from HempUSA.org.
[00:43:12.547 --> 00:43:20.954]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:43:21.174 --> 00:43:25.877]  Imagine a softer smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:43:26.098 --> 00:43:32.903]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:39.367]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[00:43:39.527 --> 00:43:50.393]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits.
[00:43:50.453 --> 00:43:55.336]  Improved taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[00:43:55.476 --> 00:43:58.998]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[00:43:59.218 --> 00:44:02.742]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:44:03.003 --> 00:44:05.566]  That's 908-691-2608.
[00:44:05.666 --> 00:44:13.695]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:14.056 --> 00:44:15.718]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:16.693 --> 00:44:17.713]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:18.233 --> 00:44:18.734]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:20.014]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:20.034 --> 00:44:21.334]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:21.414 --> 00:44:23.015]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:23.395 --> 00:44:30.137]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:30.537 --> 00:44:30.977]  Some U.S.
[00:44:31.017 --> 00:44:36.679]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:40.842]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:40.862 --> 00:44:42.863]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:10.609]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:13.212]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[00:46:34.497 --> 00:46:35.897]  Alright folks, we are back!
[00:46:36.218 --> 00:46:38.919]  It is the Alex Jones Show, final segment with Peter Dale Scott.
[00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:41.320]  Peterdalescott.net or .org.
[00:46:43.393 --> 00:46:50.038]  In the last few minutes, Peter, I really want to get your take on some of the appointments, some of the administrative officials in this.
[00:46:50.098 --> 00:46:52.199]  I mean, we've got Rahm Emanuel, Chief of Staff.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.382]  Gates is going to stay on for at least another year, they're telling us.
[00:46:55.422 --> 00:46:59.625]  John Kerry, just appointed as the head of the Foreign Relations Committee.
[00:46:59.645 --> 00:47:02.247]  What do you think about this new administration?
[00:47:03.347 --> 00:47:09.792]  Well, you know, I see a mix of hopeful and depressing features about it.
[00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:24.736]  I, you know, I'm 80 years old and I've seen a lot of new administrations and I expect them to lean in one direction to assure one constituency and another to reassure another.
[00:47:24.756 --> 00:47:32.180]  I think the one that was most predictable and upsets me the most is Rahm Emanuel as Chief of Staff.
[00:47:33.541 --> 00:47:39.064]  And that's because I've spent the last six or seven or eight years
[00:47:40.734 --> 00:47:45.758]  campaigning to have a genuine investigation of 9-11.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:57.407]  And in 2006, we had a number of people in the Democratic primaries who were saying the same thing, and many of them could have been elected, like Colonel Bowman, for example.
[00:47:58.268 --> 00:48:07.215]  And Rahm Emanuel and Senator Schumer went full out to campaign against those people in the Democratic
[00:48:07.642 --> 00:48:19.367]  Primaries, even at the cost of losing the seat, because the candidate who defeated, the good candidate, was then defeated by a Republican.
[00:48:19.507 --> 00:48:33.793]  On the economic side, you have both Geithner, assuming that he's going to get confirmed, which is not clear, and I'm certainly not happy that Lawrence Summers is the chairman of the Economic Advisors
[00:48:34.298 --> 00:48:40.403]  But what's more important here is not the people that he put in to reassure the bankers, because he has to do that.
[00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.486]  It's the people he didn't put in to balance them.
[00:48:43.766 --> 00:48:59.158]  And we could have had Stiglitz, we could have had Paul Krugman, we could have had Jamie Galbraith, or a number of good Democratic economists who were challenging the way the bailout went.
[00:48:59.819 --> 00:49:02.201]  And I'm disappointed that they're not him.
[00:49:02.842 --> 00:49:19.810]  I do think that the abuses of the Justice Department will be basically, I have no opinions really about Holder, but underneath him, the new counsel of the legal office inside Justice, a very good person.
[00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:27.034]  I think the idea that they get someone from outside the CIA, Panetta, I think is a good idea.
[00:49:30.178 --> 00:49:41.788]  Democrats, in particular, have trouble getting their nominees for head of CIA approved, and Carter had this trouble, and Kennedy had this trouble.
[00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:44.430]  I think Panetta will get in.
[00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:56.200]  He is an outsider, and he will get further, I think, than Stanfield Turner was able to, who was Carter's nominee, who was a very honest man.
[00:49:56.864 --> 00:50:00.906]  And the CIA just ignored him, really, and ran circles around him.
[00:50:00.966 --> 00:50:03.307]  I think Panetta's probably a good choice.
[00:50:03.387 --> 00:50:06.308]  So, you see, I'm not giving a very clear picture.
[00:50:06.328 --> 00:50:08.869]  And I think we shouldn't have a clear picture.
[00:50:08.929 --> 00:50:23.656]  I think we've got to give Obama his hundred days and see if he can be like Roosevelt and really get the country started up again, or whether he's going to be like Jimmy Carter and just face confusion and chaos in Washington.
[00:50:24.636 --> 00:50:25.937]  Well, thank you so much for joining us.

[00:52:02.475 --> 00:52:05.436]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:17.059 --> 00:52:18.539]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:18.899 --> 00:52:23.581]  The fourth and final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:52:24.764 --> 00:52:25.744]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:25.824 --> 00:52:26.684]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:52:26.724 --> 00:52:27.905]  I've been sitting in all week.
[00:52:28.025 --> 00:52:29.785]  Don't worry, you get Alex back on Sunday.
[00:52:31.046 --> 00:52:35.267]  We're about to have Webster Griffin Tarpley on the program after 5 After.
[00:52:35.447 --> 00:52:45.249]  Author of the recent books, Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, and of course, Barack Obama, The Postmodern Coup, which you can get at Infowars.com right now.
[00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:57.209]  I'm gonna fly through some phone calls in this first five minutes and then we'll take some phone calls for Webster Tarpley, hopefully on topic, at about 45 past the hour in the last 15 minutes.
[00:52:58.209 --> 00:53:01.510]  Alright, let's see where we're at.
[00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.491]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[00:53:03.551 --> 00:53:04.411]  John, what's on your mind?
[00:53:05.512 --> 00:53:12.874]  Yes, Jason, before I get to my point, I'd ask that you have Tarpley talk about the Middle East.
[00:53:12.914 --> 00:53:14.535]  I heard his last Saturday program
[00:53:15.607 --> 00:53:18.910]  And he didn't talk about it, but sometimes there's a delay.
[00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.951]  They play the wrong week.
[00:53:21.212 --> 00:53:33.181]  But at any rate, I think that I appreciate a lot of what Professor Scott has done over the years, especially his research into the CIA involvement, the Kennedy assassination, and the Vietnam War.
[00:53:34.182 --> 00:53:41.527]  But I think he's typical of many people who are saying, please give him a chance after Obama has shown
[00:53:44.113 --> 00:53:51.456]  That he is nothing but a stooge for the worst Wall Street and war industry interest, and he's done this.
[00:53:51.957 --> 00:54:05.643]  He's shown where he's at, even before these rotten appointments like Gates and Dennis Ross, this ultra-Zionist, and the even more ultra-Zionist rabbit warmonger Rahm Emanuel.
[00:54:06.223 --> 00:54:10.265]  He's called for increasing the troops so long ago by 100,000.
[00:54:10.305 --> 00:54:10.805]  He's called for
[00:54:12.881 --> 00:54:18.684]  He's voted for every hundreds of billions of dollars for this rotten war against Iraq.
[00:54:19.605 --> 00:54:30.691]  He's voted for the FISA, spying, or the negation of the FISA, and giving total immunity to Bush, a reinstatement of the Patriot Act.
[00:54:31.112 --> 00:54:40.537]  We know where he stands, and I think people are going to have to, I don't know if it's too late, at his inauguration, punch this bubble, this cult-like Kool-Aid Jim Jones bubble around him,
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:56.661]  And especially in this latest genocide and ethnic cleansing that he is supporting, not only by his silence, but trotting out his surrogate David Axelrod to justify the genocide that Israel is perpetrating against
[00:54:57.364 --> 00:54:59.025]  I guess the poor Palestinian people.
[00:54:59.045 --> 00:55:06.730]  Well, I don't think there is much of an argument against the fact that he's put in a hawk-like administration.
[00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:10.733]  Rahm Emanuel is extremely hawk-like.
[00:55:11.033 --> 00:55:15.476]  You know, it's just people like Peter Del Scott, people like Ray McGovern.
[00:55:15.636 --> 00:55:16.917]  They're left-leaning.
[00:55:16.937 --> 00:55:22.721]  They're still able to get on stage with the likes of Michael Moore at some of these book signings.
[00:55:22.741 --> 00:55:23.721]  I don't think he's left-leaning.
[00:55:25.066 --> 00:55:39.374]  To make excuses for this guy, there are people on the genuine left like WSW.org or even Counterpunch.com, the Coburn site.
[00:55:40.395 --> 00:55:45.057]  And these people are totally opposed from the point of view of the left.
[00:55:45.618 --> 00:55:53.122]  And I think unless people don't keep on saying, give him a chance when he's leading us into even bigger wars,
[00:55:53.735 --> 00:55:54.095]  I think?
[00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:10.613]  Insight war against Iraq, Iran...
[00:56:38.872 --> 00:56:40.213]  And this isn't even the cover of Spider-Man.
[00:56:40.273 --> 00:56:42.395]  Right here is the new global elite, Obama.
[00:56:42.555 --> 00:56:48.861]  But on the cover of Spider-Man, and it sells out in less than a day, I gotta buy a comic book that has a price tag of 4 bucks for 80 on eBay?
[00:56:49.702 --> 00:56:52.944]  Yeah, it's pretty dangerous, this cult-like Obama mentality.
[00:56:52.964 --> 00:56:54.546]  We'll be back with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:56:54.566 --> 00:56:56.788]  It's the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[00:57:08.248 --> 00:57:08.708]  Attention!
[00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:11.710]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:18.514]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:57:19.155 --> 00:57:19.875]  Curious why?
[00:57:20.636 --> 00:57:30.562]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:57:31.082 --> 00:57:33.485]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:57:33.805 --> 00:57:35.887]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:57:35.927 --> 00:57:36.408]  this fall?
[00:57:36.909 --> 00:57:37.429]  Don't wait.
[00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.453]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:58:04.249 --> 00:58:06.691]  Act now!
[00:58:06.711 --> 00:58:14.035]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:14.415 --> 00:58:16.096]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:17.034 --> 00:58:18.115]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:18.575 --> 00:58:19.096]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:19.396 --> 00:58:20.296]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:20.336 --> 00:58:21.677]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:21.738 --> 00:58:23.419]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:30.504]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:30.884 --> 00:58:31.345]  Some U.S.
[00:58:31.385 --> 00:58:37.009]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:37.709 --> 00:58:41.172]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:41.192 --> 00:58:43.374]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:07.495 --> 00:59:13.138]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:59:13.338 --> 00:59:18.480]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:23.842]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:59:24.142 --> 00:59:27.704]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:59:27.984 --> 00:59:29.705]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:32.766]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:36.027]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:59:36.267 --> 00:59:39.789]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:59:40.049 --> 00:59:44.591]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:45.651]  Do your part.
[00:59:45.911 --> 00:59:48.172]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:59:48.532 --> 00:59:54.655]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:59:54.975 --> 00:59:56.096]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:59:56.116 --> 00:59:57.297]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:57.317 --> 00:59:58.958]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in all week.
[00:59:59.019 --> 01:00:00.600]  Remember, Alex will be back on Sunday.
[01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:25.561]  I'm a filmmaker.
[01:00:26.202 --> 01:00:28.703]  I've put together quite a few 9-11 documentaries.
[01:00:28.763 --> 01:00:33.905]  My latest being Fabled Enemies really goes into the international intelligence organization that carried out 9-11.
[01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:39.747]  Of course, we have new 9-11 documents, many still being withheld, but released at the end of this presidency.
[01:00:40.087 --> 01:00:43.049]  All the transcripts from the declassified
[01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:45.289]  Interviews that they held.
[01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:50.291]  You can get Fabled Enemies right now at InfoWars.com or become a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber.
[01:00:50.651 --> 01:00:55.753]  See all of my films, all of Alex's films, and this broadcast's last two hours via the web.
[01:00:56.353 --> 01:01:00.115]  Alright, we are now joined with perhaps Obama's harshest critic.
[01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:06.527]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, author and lecturer, and he's got two books out right now about Obama.
[01:01:06.847 --> 01:01:11.808]  Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, and of course, Obama, The Postmodern Coup.
[01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:16.210]  And as we're working on this Obama film here at the Info Warrior Studios,
[01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:25.056]  You know, I tend to like this guy less and less and less, and it does seem like there is a concerted effort to really promote him, not only through the media.
[01:01:25.157 --> 01:01:29.700]  I mean, it's bad enough that MSNBC was running commercials with all their anchors.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.421]  Change with MSNBC!
[01:01:32.162 --> 01:01:34.343]  On the cover of Spider-Man this week, sold out.
[01:01:35.284 --> 01:01:37.146]  Copies are going for upwards of $150.
[01:01:37.466 --> 01:01:38.907]  You can't get one less than $80.
[01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:42.550]  Cover of the Rolling Stone, deified as a god.
[01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.311]  And now Newsweek.
[01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:55.531]  Even doing a cover article entitled Obama's Cheney Dilemma, where they make the case that the Obama administration should not get rid of any of the executive powers that were brought in under the Bush administration.
[01:01:55.571 --> 01:01:56.633]  Thank you for joining us, Webster.
[01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:58.166]  Thank you, Jason.
[01:01:58.207 --> 01:01:58.687]  How are you?
[01:01:58.707 --> 01:01:59.647]  I am good.
[01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:00.048]  I'm good.
[01:02:00.408 --> 01:02:10.555]  So I mean, it really does seem like, you know, aside from the youth corps and aside from the media promoting him, that Obama's cult-like status is just growing and growing and growing.
[01:02:10.575 --> 01:02:17.620]  I mean, when I flew into Texas last week, you know, one of the guys with the big orange batons was wearing, you know, not a
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:26.927]  A change Obama hat, not an Obama 08 hat, but just one of these stylist fashion things that you can get in any mall now because he's all over hats, he's all over t-shirts.
[01:02:26.947 --> 01:02:28.568]  I mean there's an Obama line of shoes.
[01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.989]  It's pretty incredible.
[01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:43.660]  Well I think it's not encouraging for the future of democracy to have a personality cult on the model of the various totalitarians in Europe in the 1920s and 30s.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.262]  Interestingly enough, the Washington Post
[01:02:47.065 --> 01:02:57.951]  ...has recognized that the classic Obama poster is directly out of Soviet Communism, Italian Fascism, and German National Socialism.
[01:02:58.131 --> 01:02:58.932]  And it's very interesting.
[01:02:59.312 --> 01:03:01.513]  The guy who does these things is Shepard Fairey.
[01:03:01.613 --> 01:03:02.614]  You've probably seen him.
[01:03:03.694 --> 01:03:06.536]  The cover of Time Magazine was Shepard Fairey.
[01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:09.978]  The cover of Washington Life, another one of the same type.
[01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.320]  You've probably seen the one with Obama Hope underneath.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:14.700]  Things like this.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.861]  And the Washington Post
[01:03:16.294 --> 01:03:23.040]  This is the first time they've admitted, because they've been supporting Obama, of course, because they're the house organ of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:41.876]  It says, this branding is brilliant, but it seems to disregard the iconic precedence of authoritarian propaganda originating in forms such as the Soviet poster art of the 1920s that Americans have traditionally resisted.
[01:03:41.956 --> 01:03:44.598]  So you're being invited to join the personality cult
[01:03:45.265 --> 01:03:53.533]  Of a, uh, of a demagogue who is, uh, he wants to become an authoritarian dictator, um, functioning differently than Bush.
[01:03:53.553 --> 01:03:54.694]  He's more demagogic.
[01:03:55.214 --> 01:03:59.418]  He's using left cover compared to Bush's right-wing arguments.
[01:03:59.719 --> 01:04:03.422]  Bush was talking in Latin Al-Qaeda, War on Terror, 9-11.
[01:04:03.462 --> 01:04:08.407]  He was, Bush was ranting about 9-11 last night in his farewell, which was quite a spectacle.
[01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:10.168]  But now with Obama, it's going to be different.
[01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:16.444]  As he says, the Washington Post headline of today, I think, is extremely ominous.
[01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:30.068]  It is that Obama is now pledged to loot and pillage and sack Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, with the goal, of course, of convoying that money, not to the poor, but to Wall Street.
[01:04:30.108 --> 01:04:39.811]  He's doing it under the direction of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Adolph Volcker, Trilateral Commission, Carter Administration, the guy who
[01:04:40.307 --> 01:04:41.668]  Destroyed the U.S.
[01:04:41.728 --> 01:04:47.774]  industrial base with the worst usury in history, a 22% prime rate.
[01:04:47.814 --> 01:04:48.515]  That's Volcker.
[01:04:48.575 --> 01:04:53.340]  He's the elder statesman, the eminence grise of this entire thing.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.144]  And Obama says he wants entitlement reform.
[01:04:58.244 --> 01:05:04.891]  That means that your economic rights, won by the American people and the American labor movement with all kinds of struggles,
[01:05:05.512 --> 01:05:16.176]  The Detroit sit-down strikes, the San Francisco general strike, the Minneapolis teamster strike, and the Toledo auto riot, and a million other sung and unsung labor struggles over the years.
[01:05:16.616 --> 01:05:30.622]  Obama wants to take that all away, and he says, this is where there are going to be very difficult choices and issues of sacrifice and responsibility and duty, he says.
[01:05:30.962 --> 01:05:33.403]  Sacrifice, responsibility, and duty.
[01:05:33.443 --> 01:05:34.183]  Now, this is not new.
[01:05:35.055 --> 01:05:59.940]  Michelle Obama, during the primaries, as I pointed out almost a year ago now, was talking a litany of sacrifice, meaning that they're gonna drive down the standard of living, they're gonna obviously increase the looting rate, increase the rate of primitive accumulation, including through taxation, of course, through their lunatic program of cap-and-trade, carbon tax, and all the rest of this stuff, motivated with global warming.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.700]  And I'm sure the people up in Fargo
[01:06:02.182 --> 01:06:05.323]  North Dakota, where it was 44 degrees below zero overnight.
[01:06:05.343 --> 01:06:06.443]  They're going to laugh about that.
[01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:09.283]  The whole upper Midwest is in the deep freeze.
[01:06:09.564 --> 01:06:11.004]  I'm getting calls from all my friends.
[01:06:11.024 --> 01:06:15.445]  I'm from upstate New York, and they're like, dude, it's negative 15 out right now.
[01:06:15.485 --> 01:06:17.865]  And you just mentioned global warming and a carbon tax.
[01:06:17.885 --> 01:06:22.486]  Well, this week he appointed Carl M. Browner as his global warming czar.
[01:06:22.526 --> 01:06:24.127]  She's a lunatic.
[01:06:24.187 --> 01:06:27.307]  She's a retread from the Clinton administration.
[01:06:27.347 --> 01:06:28.508]  But this is a really big thing.
[01:06:29.268 --> 01:06:30.228]  He's saying that
[01:06:31.124 --> 01:06:36.747]  That he is capable of bringing together a bipartisan, what that really means is pan-oligarchical.
[01:06:36.787 --> 01:06:44.431]  He's going to get finance oligarchs of the left and finance oligarchs of the right, Republican and Democratic financiers, bankers and so forth.
[01:06:45.091 --> 01:06:53.456]  And he's going to loot, he's going to reduce the benefits, he's going to increase the retirement age, he's going to increase the taxation on these things.
[01:06:53.756 --> 01:06:59.079]  And it's so ironic because last night, under Obama's leadership, the second round of the
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:08.004]  ...was essentially approved another $350 billion, and about half of it is already gone because it went to Bank of America overnight.
[01:07:08.484 --> 01:07:25.273]  Bank of America, a bankrupt institution, bankrupt because of derivatives, because of, you know, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, auction rate securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, all the rest of these crazy derivatives.
[01:07:25.836 --> 01:07:28.057]  Bank of America is bankrupt, everybody knows it.
[01:07:28.117 --> 01:07:37.379]  Now, they've been bailed out once under the first round of the TARP, to the tune of $25 billion, and now they're getting a second round of $168 billion, following Citibank, right?
[01:07:37.419 --> 01:07:54.743]  Citibank had been bailed out once and then had to be bailed out twice in November, and everybody knows that Citibank is about to go under for the third time, and JPMorgan Chase is going down, down, down, down, along with Union Bank of Switzerland and all sorts of others that operate in the U.S.
[01:07:55.703 --> 01:07:56.884]  So this is a disaster.
[01:07:58.265 --> 01:07:59.926]  I think Obama has dropped the mask.
[01:08:00.066 --> 01:08:03.768]  Today he's talking about renewable energy and his green jobs.
[01:08:03.828 --> 01:08:17.617]  Well, the problem with what he calls renewable energy, meaning windmills and solar cells and ethanol and other boondoggles, essentially, that have to be subsidized, is that every time you build one, it's a net loss for the economy.
[01:08:17.657 --> 01:08:24.081]  It's a net loss because the amount of energy you have to put in to create some of these things, or all of them, virtually,
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.042]  Is more than you'll ever get out of it in the entire life of the investment.
[01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:35.886]  So the more you have green jobs and renewable energy, the poorer and more backward you're going to get.
[01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:40.069]  Obama today is talking about how countries like Spain are ahead of the United States.
[01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:49.954]  Yeah, they're ahead of the United States in the race to the bottom because they'll go bankrupt even faster because of their stress on green jobs, renewable energy, global warming.
[01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:51.277]  And the polar bears.
[01:08:51.357 --> 01:08:58.082]  So you're getting to the point now where human civilization, the fabric of human civilization is at stake.
[01:08:58.622 --> 01:09:03.366]  And obviously you can say, well, um, you know, let the depression work.
[01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:06.688]  I suppose there are some who say you can't interfere with the depression.
[01:09:06.708 --> 01:09:08.109]  You have to let it work itself out.
[01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:11.932]  You have to hope for creative destruction and hope for a recovery on the other side.
[01:09:12.072 --> 01:09:14.294]  I say that is, that's ridiculous.
[01:09:14.354 --> 01:09:15.155]  That's absurd.
[01:09:15.215 --> 01:09:16.976]  And it's also going to get a lot of people killed.
[01:09:17.392 --> 01:09:22.996]  We can and must and can easily fight the Depression successfully, because we know how to do it, right?
[01:09:23.016 --> 01:09:26.999]  We have the examples of the 1930s, 1940s here in the United States.
[01:09:27.019 --> 01:09:36.905]  You can take the examples that work and the ones that don't work from the New Deal, the Roosevelt period, the labor struggles that go together with that, and you can apply that to the present time.
[01:09:37.646 --> 01:09:43.129]  What Obama's trying to do, though, is essentially imitating, it's not very widely known, Mussolini.
[01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:45.151]  Mussolini in the 1930s, after he invaded Ethiopia.
[01:09:47.492 --> 01:09:55.657]  ...was slapped with oil sanctions by the League of Nations, so the Italian economy went into autarky, meaning energy independence, including ethanol.
[01:09:55.797 --> 01:10:00.220]  That's one of the ways that ethanol was developed, was in Italy in the late 1930s.
[01:10:00.721 --> 01:10:16.511]  And this, of course, is a tremendous failure, and it makes a society that is so impoverished and hysterical that you get yourself into wars very easily, because the dictator has then got to pick quarrels with foreign countries to somehow unload all of this tension.
[01:10:17.498 --> 01:10:30.228]  I'm very much afraid we're going into 100 days to the fascist corporate state, and it is imperative now to organize a sophisticated, enlightened opposition to Obama.
[01:10:30.488 --> 01:10:33.450]  The problem you have, we can go through the Obama cabinet, right?
[01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:34.591]  The appointments that he's made.
[01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:36.632]  Some of these are just hair-raising.
[01:10:36.672 --> 01:10:43.938]  I've already mentioned Volcker, but you look at people like Geithner and Summers and Gates and the new Dr. Rice.
[01:10:44.497 --> 01:10:56.482]  And Vilsack at Agriculture, and Arnie Duncan, and this guy Donovan at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and so on down the line.
[01:10:56.902 --> 01:11:04.585]  This is the greatest concentration of Wall Street banker influence and power that we've ever seen in the history of the country.
[01:11:05.025 --> 01:11:07.646]  There's nobody at the table except Wall Street.
[01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:09.267]  Labor counts for nothing.
[01:11:10.087 --> 01:11:11.488]  Retirees count for nothing.
[01:11:11.588 --> 01:11:12.588]  Women count for nothing.
[01:11:12.888 --> 01:11:14.249]  Black community counts for nothing.
[01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:15.845]  Hispanics count for nothing.
[01:11:16.025 --> 01:11:17.066]  Asians get nothing.
[01:11:18.026 --> 01:11:19.386]  Small business gets nothing.
[01:11:19.466 --> 01:11:20.846]  Heavy industry gets nothing.
[01:11:21.646 --> 01:11:23.927]  The defense contractors get basically nothing.
[01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.707]  Big oil gets virtually nothing.
[01:11:26.047 --> 01:11:27.368]  Auto, of course, gets nothing.
[01:11:27.888 --> 01:11:34.749]  So what you've got is the reign of pure financier, paper-backed derivatives merchants.
[01:11:34.809 --> 01:11:38.970]  In other words, the people who are now about to seize power in Washington.
[01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:44.707]  Are the ones behind the 1.5 quadrillion dollar derivatives bubble and uh... God help us!
[01:11:46.009 --> 01:11:50.573]  Well, they're calling for an 825 billion dollar stimulus bill.
[01:11:51.114 --> 01:11:52.135]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[01:11:52.535 --> 01:11:55.438]  It's the Alex Jones Show, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:13:07.429 --> 01:13:09.472]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:13:09.592 --> 01:13:11.995]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:13:12.015 --> 01:13:14.599]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:14.679 --> 01:13:15.820]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.442]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:13:17.563 --> 01:13:20.346]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:13:20.366 --> 01:13:24.091]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:13:33.707 --> 01:13:38.632]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.034]  An inside job?
[01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.457]  How dare you?
[01:13:43.657 --> 01:13:49.923]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:13:50.063 --> 01:13:52.245]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:13:56.172 --> 01:13:56.332]  Gold.
[01:13:56.352 --> 01:13:57.552]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:13:57.572 --> 01:13:58.573]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[01:13:58.593 --> 01:14:00.253]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[01:14:00.293 --> 01:14:01.813]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:14:02.033 --> 01:14:04.094]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:14:20.058 --> 01:14:21.939]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.280]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:32.164]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:14:32.525 --> 01:14:41.429]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:49.674]  We're good.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.421]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:15.762]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:15:15.942 --> 01:15:20.723]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:15:21.103 --> 01:15:32.226]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:38.170]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:44.475]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[01:16:18.323 --> 01:16:23.204]  Starbucks wants to make it easy to join Obama's proposed paramilitary brownshirt volunteers.
[01:16:24.164 --> 01:16:31.926]  Starbucks will honor each person who pledges with a free tall brewed coffee beginning Wednesday, January 21st through the Sunday, January 25th.
[01:16:32.706 --> 01:16:41.048]  The goal of the effort is to raise pledges in excess of one million hours of service from all over the country for the new domestic Obama force.
[01:16:41.068 --> 01:16:42.208]  Well, thank you, Starbucks.
[01:16:42.268 --> 01:16:45.949]  The coffee I had was delicious and I'm glad that you're pushing fascism.
[01:16:45.969 --> 01:16:47.089]  It's very nice of you.
[01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:54.311]  So, you know, this is just another effort, not only by the media, but to really get the people behind them.
[01:16:54.331 --> 01:16:56.532]  I mean, again, cover of Spider-Man.
[01:16:56.552 --> 01:16:58.172]  The Spider-Man comic sold out.
[01:16:58.332 --> 01:16:59.373]  I mean, people hoarded it.
[01:16:59.893 --> 01:17:00.973]  I can't get a copy for under $80.
[01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:06.415]  This is, you know, a $4 comic book, something that probably cost them 30 cents to make on a printing press.
[01:17:07.135 --> 01:17:10.336]  And, you know, of course, he's given the new cool guy bump with Spider-Man.
[01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:11.757]  He's the real hipster.
[01:17:11.977 --> 01:17:15.318]  And when I saw that, you know, we played the Obama Youth Brigade clip earlier.
[01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:20.283]  The Obama Youth Brigade clip, I mean, because of Obama, I can be the next engineer.
[01:17:20.603 --> 01:17:22.584]  Because of Obama, I can be the next architect.
[01:17:22.624 --> 01:17:24.285]  Well, how about pride in yourself?
[01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:27.606]  Why do you need a figure like Obama to do these things?
[01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:34.169]  And now the Democrats have proposed an $825 billion stimulus bill, one of many, I'm sure.
[01:17:34.209 --> 01:17:37.831]  I mean, Bernanke this week came out and said they're going to need more bailouts.
[01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:42.293]  Paulson, from the very beginning, said that banks were going to go under no matter what happened with these bailouts.
[01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:46.055]  Webster, what do you see happening in the next couple months?
[01:17:46.075 --> 01:17:47.677]  We're six days away from the inauguration.
[01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.999]  Do you see another bailout bill being passed?
[01:17:50.019 --> 01:17:51.781]  Do you see the stimulus bill going through?
[01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:53.402]  What's on the agenda?
[01:17:53.502 --> 01:18:02.550]  The second round of the TARP just went through last night, so the second $350 billion, and that got Obama off the hook because Bush is now giving all that money to Bank of America.
[01:18:03.691 --> 01:18:09.777]  Generally, the TARP is a monstrosity, and you ought to set up the criterion, not one penny more
[01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:17.756]  To banks, insurance companies, credit card companies, mutual funds, money markets, or any other financial institution.
[01:18:18.236 --> 01:18:24.318]  They were given the first round of the tarp, saying if they got that money they would start lending again to business and industry.
[01:18:24.498 --> 01:18:28.479]  Well, we had General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.601]  JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citibank refused to lend to the automobile industry.
[01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:37.622]  The government had to come in and save them, which I support.
[01:18:37.682 --> 01:18:39.223]  You've absolutely got to save.
[01:18:39.679 --> 01:18:48.504]  Productive employment, industrial assembly lines have got to be kept, otherwise you're in the third world and the Banana Republic League and you don't get out of it so easily.
[01:18:48.805 --> 01:18:53.548]  So, the main idea is stop with the bailout of the derivatives bubble.
[01:18:53.968 --> 01:18:54.768]  It's futile.
[01:18:54.888 --> 01:18:55.589]  It's hopeless.
[01:18:55.989 --> 01:19:07.016]  There's not enough money in the world to ever bail out 1.5 quadrillion of poisonous, bloated, cancerous, fictitious, bloated derivatives
[01:19:07.871 --> 01:19:09.853]  Which are now the essence of the banking system.
[01:19:09.873 --> 01:19:11.454]  In other words, these banks, J.P.
[01:19:11.474 --> 01:19:14.777]  Morgan, Citibank, and Bank of America, they're all bankrupt.
[01:19:14.797 --> 01:19:15.738]  They should be seized.
[01:19:15.898 --> 01:19:17.179]  They shouldn't be demanding money.
[01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:24.044]  They should be in Chapter 11, and indeed in Chapter 7, because I think most of them are just hopeless economic black holes.
[01:19:24.104 --> 01:19:28.228]  Now, on the recovery program, or stimulus program, I think there should be one.
[01:19:28.288 --> 01:19:32.251]  Well, let's ask ourselves, should the government fight the Depression?
[01:19:32.411 --> 01:19:33.432]  Yeah, of course it should.
[01:19:33.692 --> 01:19:34.673]  You're damn right it should.
[01:19:35.049 --> 01:19:47.213]  The question is, with Obama, you've got a combination of only bailouts for bankers, no money for productive activity, and then his stimulus is basically green jobs, which I talked about before.
[01:19:47.393 --> 01:19:50.134]  Every green job is a net loss for the economy.
[01:19:50.154 --> 01:19:54.155]  You get deeper and deeper in the Depression, the more green you want.
[01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:59.977]  You've got to have modern technology, probably 100 nuclear reactors, two in each state.
[01:20:00.325 --> 01:20:02.306]  Would be the best energy policy.
[01:20:02.566 --> 01:20:06.248]  You'd want to build a transcontinental magnetic levitation railway.
[01:20:06.548 --> 01:20:12.610]  You'd want to put high-speed rail commuter systems around the 25 largest metropolitan areas.
[01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:20.113]  Either rebuild the ones you have, the ones in New York City are a hundred years old, or in many places like Houston, there's just nothing.
[01:20:20.173 --> 01:20:21.534]  So you start from scratch.
[01:20:22.114 --> 01:20:23.455]  So that would be another thing.
[01:20:23.495 --> 01:20:28.577]  But with Obama, it's partly green jobs, again, of net loss, and then
[01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:31.440]  He's got this stuff about community development grants.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:36.941]  Now that looks very much like funding things like ACORN and this fascist infrastructure.
[01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:49.884]  In other words, a series of parasitical organizations which are going to be used then to try to become a battering ram against other groups in the society that may disagree with the way that things are going.
[01:20:49.984 --> 01:20:53.845]  But the idea is, ultimately, this is a de-industrialized country.
[01:20:54.205 --> 01:20:57.226]  The de-industrialization was done under Paul Adolph Volcker.
[01:20:57.543 --> 01:20:58.604]  You've got to roll that back.
[01:20:58.704 --> 01:21:01.125]  You've got to reconvert and re-industrialize.
[01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:05.247]  We're looking now, very soon, at a crisis of the dollar.
[01:21:05.307 --> 01:21:06.668]  That's obviously the next step.
[01:21:07.428 --> 01:21:09.349]  Three, six months down the line.
[01:21:09.409 --> 01:21:10.290]  I can't tell when.
[01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:21.275]  But quite soon, as this 8 to 9 trillion, 10 trillion of injected capital begins to work its way through, you're going to see the dollar begin to fall against the euro and the yen.
[01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:23.277]  It's been falling against the yen the whole time.
[01:21:23.357 --> 01:21:26.038]  Against the euro, it's been actually increasing.
[01:21:26.645 --> 01:21:33.949]  And once you realize that the foreign value of the dollar is the value of the dollar, you're going to get into dollar hyperinflation.
[01:21:34.409 --> 01:21:36.630]  So you've got to do something about that.
[01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:41.632]  And that means you've got to earn foreign exchange to pay for the imports that you want.
[01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:44.674]  In other words, you won't be able to give funny pieces of green paper.
[01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:47.195]  You're going to have to earn the money or the gold to pay for it.
[01:21:47.215 --> 01:21:48.156]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:48.176 --> 01:21:50.137]  We'll be back with Webster Griffin Tarpley after this.
[01:21:50.217 --> 01:21:52.118]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:57.688 --> 01:22:00.669]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:22:01.609 --> 01:22:04.390]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:08.392 --> 01:22:09.612]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[01:22:09.912 --> 01:22:11.073]  eFoods does it again.
[01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:16.074]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with 3 days worth of healthy, delicious, easy fix food.
[01:22:16.394 --> 01:22:20.696]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:22:28.695 --> 01:22:28.915]  I think?
[01:22:50.094 --> 01:22:53.937]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:53.957 --> 01:22:55.858]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:17.065 --> 01:23:18.086]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:19.127]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:19.407 --> 01:23:20.408]  This is his M.O.
[01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:21.750]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:23.392]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:23.772 --> 01:23:30.539]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:31.380]  Some U.S.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:37.046]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:41.269]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:51.498]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:23:51.739 --> 01:23:52.479]  Fabled enemies.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:24:00.246]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:00.727 --> 01:24:04.090]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:07.814 --> 01:24:11.077]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:24:11.257 --> 01:24:15.341]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:24:15.521 --> 01:24:23.489]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:24:23.749 --> 01:24:24.189]  We're good to go!
[01:24:57.009 --> 01:25:00.510]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com or call 888-213-4338.
[01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:01.731]  888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[01:25:01.771 --> 01:25:02.571]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:25:02.591 --> 01:25:03.131]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:26.943 --> 01:25:32.867]  We're on the line with Webster Griffin Tarpley, the author of Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography.
[01:25:32.968 --> 01:25:34.709]  Let's not forget George H.W.
[01:25:34.749 --> 01:25:36.650]  Bush, the Unauthorized Biography either.
[01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:39.312]  And of course, Obama, the Postmodern Coup.
[01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:42.235]  You can get that over at Infowars.com right now.
[01:25:43.379 --> 01:25:50.844]  I want to shift gears just a little bit and talk about whether or not you believe that we'll have military conscription under this new administration.
[01:25:50.884 --> 01:25:58.769]  I mean, you've got Rahm Emanuel talking about 18 to 25, everybody serves three months in basic training, and then you're in the military.
[01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.849]  We now have
[01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.830]  We're good to go.
[01:26:20.936 --> 01:26:34.986]  He doesn't like it, but we're just gonna need the draft for these emerging military threats in the Middle East and one of those would happen to be Pakistan and Webster, you were one of the first people to actually talk about this Pakistani threat, so do you think that we will see conscription in this country?
[01:26:35.626 --> 01:26:42.911]  Let me say first of all that people who went through 2008 talking about an attack on Iran, there was no attack on Iran.
[01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:49.496]  There will be no attack on Iran and the Israelis have been told that they're not allowed to attack Iran, so they've been essentially banned
[01:26:50.134 --> 01:26:51.195]  from attacking Iran.
[01:26:51.635 --> 01:27:03.784]  I think there's certainly a big push towards what amounts to compulsory militias, compulsory service, masquerading as volunteer service.
[01:27:03.824 --> 01:27:11.850]  Here we have Colin Powell wants everybody to carry out volunteer service to celebrate Martin Luther King Day.
[01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:13.111]  I really wonder
[01:27:13.615 --> 01:27:31.939]  Whether Volker, Geithner, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Blankfein from Goldman Sachs, Mac over at Morgan Stanley, Larry Summers from the White House, I really wonder if Rahm Emanuel is going to be out there carrying out volunteer service.
[01:27:31.979 --> 01:27:33.800]  And I somehow, I doubt it.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.361]  And the military side of it is perfectly possible.
[01:27:37.781 --> 01:27:42.482]  And I think what you see now is a kind of gloating in the ruling class that they now
[01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:54.070]  have a whole series of options that had been foreclosed during the late Bush years because of the fact that Bush was so discredited and so hated and so isolated that they couldn't get away with those things.
[01:27:54.170 --> 01:28:00.512]  And obviously the military draft is one side of it, and he would bring that in under the left cover.
[01:28:00.552 --> 01:28:04.733]  He'd say, we have a humanitarian emergency in Darfur in Sudan.
[01:28:05.133 --> 01:28:07.193]  The Burmese government is oppressive.
[01:28:07.593 --> 01:28:10.554]  The Pakistanis are harassing women.
[01:28:11.107 --> 01:28:20.253]  So it would be now a series of invasions conducted under left cover rather than under the worn out discredited cliches of 9-11.
[01:28:20.273 --> 01:28:21.974]  So I think all that's possible.
[01:28:22.014 --> 01:28:26.037]  The other obvious possibility is the false flag option.
[01:28:26.097 --> 01:28:34.923]  And remember the famous or infamous speech by Joe Biden in Seattle on October 19th is going to be a foreign affairs crisis in the first six months.
[01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.685]  It's going to be ginned up, generated, fake.
[01:28:38.165 --> 01:28:39.486]  The righteousness of the U.S.
[01:28:39.546 --> 01:28:40.927]  position will not be obvious.
[01:28:41.383 --> 01:28:42.444]  Gotta support Barkey.
[01:28:43.024 --> 01:29:09.425]  And then the other one, the 12-month perspective that the economic policies of the new administration, obviously now based on austerity, sacrifice, lowering the standard of living, wage gouging, taking away various economic rights under left cover, that that would make the whole Obama team so hated that their standing in the polls will have collapsed within 12 months, which based on the model of Jimmy Carter, I think is about right.
[01:29:09.465 --> 01:29:10.466]  And actually, I think it'll go even
[01:29:10.876 --> 01:29:12.977]  Even faster this time around.
[01:29:13.037 --> 01:29:15.698]  So they've got all of these things going.
[01:29:15.818 --> 01:29:19.979]  And I, of course, urge people, don't suspend your critical judgment.
[01:29:20.039 --> 01:29:29.463]  Don't have your autonomous judgment as a citizen taken away by this hysteria, this hype, the messianic, utopian rhetoric.
[01:29:29.903 --> 01:29:33.184]  The inaugural address will be a tissue of lies.
[01:29:33.264 --> 01:29:40.247]  And as a matter of fact, let me ask people, if you have a chance, tomorrow afternoon, starting at 2 o'clock Eastern,
[01:29:40.683 --> 01:29:45.204]  You can, on this same network, Genesis, you can go over to my program, the World Crisis Radio.
[01:29:45.744 --> 01:29:59.627]  I recorded, just in the past couple of hours, a counter-inaugural, counter-State of the Union, where I go through an economic recovery program to fight the Depression, a program for world peace, a program of institutional reform.
[01:29:59.667 --> 01:30:03.988]  Just listen to that and you'll get the whole lowdown on the way that I see things.
[01:30:04.048 --> 01:30:06.509]  But the important thing now is to have an opposition.
[01:30:07.349 --> 01:30:08.549]  If Obama comes forward with a
[01:30:09.059 --> 01:30:15.742]  With a bailout of $850 billion, it simply will not do to stand around in the corner saying, I want the free market, I want the free market.
[01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:21.725]  It's like saying I want Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to come and save me, because this stuff just doesn't exist.
[01:30:21.785 --> 01:30:23.746]  It's nowhere to be found in the world.
[01:30:23.786 --> 01:30:30.249]  We live in a world of monopoly cartels, trusts, oligopolies, duopolies, you name it.
[01:30:30.689 --> 01:30:31.790]  There's no free market.
[01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:33.871]  There never really has been in centuries.
[01:30:34.726 --> 01:30:43.771]  If you talk about free market and say you think that the government ought to let the depression take its course, this basically puts you in a deep freeze.
[01:30:43.831 --> 01:30:45.753]  It puts you off the political map.
[01:30:46.133 --> 01:30:54.758]  What you've got to be able to do is have the sophistication to get in there and distinguish between the things that Obama will have in his programs that are good and that ought to be in there.
[01:30:54.798 --> 01:30:59.040]  He'll say, more money for food stamps, yes, ten times as much as Obama wants.
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.502]  He'll say, more money for unemployment benefits, 52 weeks.
[01:31:02.532 --> 01:31:04.213]  A hundred and four weeks, yes.
[01:31:04.634 --> 01:31:06.195]  Ten times as much as Obama wants.
[01:31:06.235 --> 01:31:09.137]  And then they'll say, green jobs and green energy, no.
[01:31:09.157 --> 01:31:12.999]  Then they'll say community development block grants for ACORN, no.
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:25.008]  So that you get in there and actually grapple with these problems rather than retreating into some ivory tower of a world that has not existed and certainly does not exist now.
[01:31:25.068 --> 01:31:29.851]  You've got to get in there and be able to fight, you know, point by point, as Obama
[01:31:30.836 --> 01:31:33.498]  He's got a woman called Killifer.
[01:31:34.379 --> 01:31:37.821]  I suppose she's going to be Madame Killjoy or Madame Killer.
[01:31:38.222 --> 01:31:42.565]  Killifer is the performance officer of the administration.
[01:31:43.145 --> 01:31:52.211]  We can avoid all the obvious jokes about that, but the performance officer is that she's supposed to go through the federal budget line by line and find out the things that are not necessary.
[01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:55.313]  So she's going to be the new cap the knife, right?
[01:31:55.373 --> 01:31:58.936]  The new austerity czar and budget deficit hawk.
[01:31:59.477 --> 01:32:09.783]  And the kind of thing that somebody like this is going to do to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and to all the other remnants that we have of our tattered social safety net.
[01:32:09.823 --> 01:32:11.624]  This is going to be an absolute tragedy.
[01:32:12.004 --> 01:32:15.306]  But again, you've got to be able to get in there and fight point by point.
[01:32:15.626 --> 01:32:16.866]  You've got to get in there and grapple.
[01:32:17.287 --> 01:32:19.588]  And I hope that people will join in that.
[01:32:19.828 --> 01:32:23.370]  You can see some ideas for it at actindependent.org website.
[01:32:24.386 --> 01:32:35.154]  Well, going back to you talking about left cover and how we're going to, you know, have this possible conscription, don't you think that he's still using just a little bit of the right cover with the war on terror?
[01:32:35.174 --> 01:32:43.461]  I mean, first of all, Bush in his, maybe not in his farewell speech, but his last media appearance, he said that his number one thing was keeping America safe from another terrorist attack.
[01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:43.701]  Right.
[01:32:43.741 --> 01:32:50.246]  That'll be the number one thing for the Obama administration, and the Obama administration is already talking about really a redistribution
[01:32:50.706 --> 01:32:56.149]  Of course, from Iraq, of course we're de-escalating there, but he says he's going to put them into Afghanistan.
[01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.531]  So I see them creating the same quagmire there.
[01:32:58.551 --> 01:33:09.117]  The only place in the world, the only place in the world that they still talk about Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda is this area where Obama and Biden claim that Bin Laden lives.
[01:33:09.257 --> 01:33:18.722]  Remember, that was the line in Obama's convention speech was, Bush says he'll go to the end of the earth to get Osama Bin Laden, but he won't go to the cave where he lives.
[01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:19.803]  Meaning, let's invade
[01:33:20.353 --> 01:33:20.793]  I don't think so.
[01:33:39.383 --> 01:33:43.086]  They're going to go after Pakistan with the goal of dividing it up, right?
[01:33:43.126 --> 01:33:49.430]  Remember, it's Balochistan, Pashtunistan, Waziristan, Sindh, Punjab, tribal areas.
[01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:52.252]  The idea is to shatter it into mini-states, right?
[01:33:52.312 --> 01:33:54.374]  Mini-states, micro-states, regionalism.
[01:33:54.794 --> 01:33:57.856]  And the general model is, they're against big government.
[01:33:57.876 --> 01:33:59.017]  They don't like big government.
[01:33:59.057 --> 01:34:01.059]  The government in Islamabad is big government.
[01:34:01.099 --> 01:34:01.719]  They don't like it.
[01:34:02.119 --> 01:34:05.021]  They want to have mini-states, and above that, the empire.
[01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:05.662]  That's the new
[01:34:06.272 --> 01:34:13.955]  And they have India now as a relatively willing spear point against that until somebody in India does something about it.
[01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:19.898]  But if you look at the past six months, Brzezinski and company have already been dictating policy.
[01:34:19.918 --> 01:34:23.359]  In other words, Bush and Cheney left power long ago.
[01:34:23.499 --> 01:34:26.200]  They have not been calling the shots for at least a year.
[01:34:26.721 --> 01:34:29.542]  And what has happened, of course, is Georgia attacks Russia.
[01:34:29.762 --> 01:34:32.223]  Straight Brzezinski-Soros foreign policy.
[01:34:32.603 --> 01:34:34.544]  Ukraine has just cut
[01:34:35.049 --> 01:34:50.659]  The gas deliveries from Russia to Europe, which I've been predicting for, what, four or five months, since August at least, that there would be a natural gas crisis created by these NATO IMF puppets in Kiev, the Yushchenko regime.
[01:34:50.719 --> 01:34:52.100]  So they're trying to gin that up.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.482]  And then behind that, remember, is the Polish missile crisis.
[01:34:55.603 --> 01:34:58.184]  And again, that supposedly got to do with Iran.
[01:34:58.665 --> 01:35:03.768]  But I think you're going to see that the 9-11 stuff gets to be less and less relevant for all areas.
[01:35:04.258 --> 01:35:16.888]  Other than Pakistan, which of course is important, and you're going to get more into this area of great power rivalry, and I think the great danger is of course that there will be some new false flag that will essentially change the subject.
[01:35:16.948 --> 01:35:26.976]  In other words, it will be, you know, Bin Laden has joined the KGB, or Bin Laden has joined the Beijing secret police or something, and now he's operating for them, right?
[01:35:27.611 --> 01:35:32.015]  Some, you know, form of this Legion of Super-Villains or something like this.
[01:35:33.156 --> 01:35:34.677]  And then try to use that.
[01:35:34.737 --> 01:35:37.979]  But the main idea is that you can't muck around in the Middle East.
[01:35:38.059 --> 01:35:40.521]  Again, the fact that there has been no attack on Iran.
[01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:44.885]  Notice, Biden went to the Israelis and said, guess what Israelis?
[01:35:45.205 --> 01:35:49.489]  There's going to be a nuclear Iran and you're going to like it and you're going to do nothing.
[01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:54.673]  Now, the caller that you had at the beginning of the hour wants to know about Gaza, of course.
[01:35:55.143 --> 01:35:59.885]  It's an orgy of genocide by the Israelis and it has to be stopped.
[01:36:00.306 --> 01:36:03.007]  The one person who could stop it is Obama.
[01:36:03.147 --> 01:36:07.729]  Obama could simply make a statement, I call on the Israeli government to stop what they're doing.
[01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:12.632]  At that point the Israeli government would probably collapse and the operation would cease.
[01:36:12.732 --> 01:36:13.872]  Notice he doesn't do this.
[01:36:14.353 --> 01:36:22.957]  The reason is that the attack on Gaza is a kind of a consolation prize for people like Zippy Livni and Ehud Barak who want to be
[01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:24.670]  The successors of Olmert.
[01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:27.851]  They want to compete with Netanyahu as warmongers.
[01:36:28.211 --> 01:36:29.892]  So they've been given this opportunity.
[01:36:29.932 --> 01:36:40.395]  They're told, you know, go in and kill 1,000 to 2,000 people, and then you can run on that and you can compete with Netanyahu because you're not going to be allowed to attack Iran.
[01:36:40.435 --> 01:36:48.597]  And, you know, it's a constant flow of news stories that the Israelis were pressing and asking, and the answer kept being no, no, no, and that came from Gates.
[01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:51.571]  It came from Mullen, and it came from the U.S.
[01:36:51.611 --> 01:36:53.111]  administration in general, because the U.S.
[01:36:53.151 --> 01:36:54.831]  and the British just don't want this.
[01:36:55.291 --> 01:36:57.072]  They want to look at Pakistan.
[01:36:57.752 --> 01:36:59.732]  And again, Pakistan is an energy corridor.
[01:37:00.272 --> 01:37:04.073]  Pakistan is the way that Iranian oil could go overland to China.
[01:37:04.533 --> 01:37:16.856]  Pakistan is a way that tankers could unload at the port of Gwadar and send oil up to Pakistan, all the way into China, above the Himalayas, above Kashmir, and so forth.
[01:37:17.378 --> 01:37:18.478]  It's an energy corridor.
[01:37:18.518 --> 01:37:29.062]  Pakistan has got to be destroyed, not because of Pakistan, but because it's an ally of China, and we're now in the area of Russia, China, Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
[01:37:29.102 --> 01:37:30.202]  That's the new enemies list.
[01:37:30.242 --> 01:37:45.426]  So, generally speaking, kick the Chinese out of Africa, attack Sudan to cut off the oil from there, attack Zimbabwe somehow to prevent the Chinese from getting minerals from there, attack anybody in Africa who's dealing with the Chinese, attack Pakistan, attack Burma.
[01:37:45.727 --> 01:37:47.087]  These are all Chinese allies.
[01:37:47.857 --> 01:37:50.838]  And then ultimately try to play China against Russia.
[01:37:50.878 --> 01:37:54.080]  So this is the perspective that they have.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:38:00.022]  And they will need to evolve the ideology, because you can't come forward sounding like Bush-Cheney neocons.
[01:38:00.042 --> 01:38:01.923]  You've got to sound like something new.
[01:38:02.223 --> 01:38:12.508]  Generally speaking, I think they'll talk much more about human rights and genocide, Darfur, Burma, places like this.
[01:38:12.568 --> 01:38:15.269]  I think that's the wave of the future.
[01:38:16.266 --> 01:38:19.147]  All right, let's take some callers in the last 15 minutes of the show.
[01:38:19.167 --> 01:38:20.507]  Let's try to keep it on topic.
[01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:24.369]  And for Webster Tarpley, let us go to Matt in Ohio.
[01:38:24.449 --> 01:38:25.229]  Matt, what's on your mind?
[01:38:25.249 --> 01:38:26.909]  Hi, Jason.
[01:38:26.929 --> 01:38:27.930]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:29.150]  And hi, Mr. Tarpley.
[01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.990]  Hello.
[01:38:31.691 --> 01:38:40.914]  My first question was, which one of your books gives some groundwork for your economic plans?
[01:38:40.994 --> 01:38:41.934]  Thank you so much.
[01:38:42.234 --> 01:38:42.594]  Thank you.
[01:38:43.014 --> 01:38:45.315]  It's called Surviving the Cataclysm.
[01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:53.743]  And the second edition will come out from Progressive Press of California within a month or two, or something like that.
[01:38:54.083 --> 01:39:01.447]  We meant to do this a year ago, but then along came Obama, and I had to shift into overdrive to try to warn people about Obama, right?
[01:39:01.487 --> 01:39:04.928]  Two books in about five or six months.
[01:39:05.008 --> 01:39:09.290]  But there is a second edition now that's practically in the press of Surviving the Cataclysm.
[01:39:09.571 --> 01:39:11.952]  You can send an email to info at progressivepress.com.
[01:39:12.842 --> 01:39:14.583]  And get on the list and be informed of this.
[01:39:15.243 --> 01:39:22.468]  I think you can probably even sell you an electronic version, which is going to be a little bit messy, but it may be the thing.
[01:39:22.548 --> 01:39:24.689]  And that was the basic story there.
[01:39:24.729 --> 01:39:26.250]  That was written about ten years ago.
[01:39:26.710 --> 01:39:35.135]  And it talks about deindustrialization and the derivatives bubble as leading towards a world economic depression of unprecedented severity.
[01:39:35.155 --> 01:39:36.496]  And that's where we are now.
[01:39:36.576 --> 01:39:38.017]  So that was ten years before.
[01:39:39.153 --> 01:39:59.399]  Okay, the reason why I ask is because I'm pretty much a free market adherent, and I've heard you talk about, you're on another radio program about a week or two ago, and you don't seem to really think the free market would work in this situation, so I just kind of wanted to get some of your
[01:39:59.915 --> 01:40:10.980]  Fortunately, I haven't been drinking enough fluoride to not be willing to question my assumptions, so I wanted to get some groundwork, just to re-look at that analysis.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:20.584]  Well, definitely check it out, because Webster, again, you put it out there ten years ago, and right now, ten years later, is when a second edition is warranted, and I'm sure, would you add a couple chapters, basically?
[01:40:20.604 --> 01:40:20.924]  Yeah, sure.
[01:40:20.944 --> 01:40:22.465]  There's a new economic program.
[01:40:23.567 --> 01:40:23.767]  I don't
[01:40:42.748 --> 01:40:45.470]  The other part, the thing about free market is that this is a myth.
[01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:46.851]  This does not exist.
[01:40:47.631 --> 01:40:52.314]  The 19th century generally knew that the subject you're talking about is political economy.
[01:40:52.374 --> 01:40:56.197]  In other words, it's economics and the state, economics and the government.
[01:40:56.697 --> 01:41:01.360]  And the only time that you don't have that is if you're in the old stone age, right?
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:09.926]  If you're in the Paleolithic hunting and gathering caveman phase, when there's no state, then you could call that a market, I suppose, but that's basically
[01:41:10.410 --> 01:41:16.416]  Hunting and gathering since the emergence of the state in any form about, what, 10,000 BC, right?
[01:41:16.436 --> 01:41:18.517]  When you go into the Neolithic, right?
[01:41:18.538 --> 01:41:19.438]  The New Stone Age.
[01:41:19.819 --> 01:41:22.441]  Then you've already got some kind of a state coming up.
[01:41:23.642 --> 01:41:25.424]  And then you're talking about political economies.
[01:41:25.444 --> 01:41:29.087]  So the idea that you talk about economics as if there's no government is crazy.
[01:41:29.407 --> 01:41:30.929]  All of this grows out of Ricardo.
[01:41:31.297 --> 01:41:50.923]  The founder of monetarist economics is David Ricardo, who was on the board of directors of the British East India Company, and he ran opium, and he ran the monster debt of the British after the Napoleonic Wars, and from there it goes on to Oxford, and then it goes on to Vienna, and the various people from Vienna you know.
[01:41:51.283 --> 01:41:54.544]  And the thesis of that school is that production is impossible.
[01:41:54.964 --> 01:41:58.625]  That there's no such thing as production that creates something qualitatively new,
[01:41:59.119 --> 01:42:02.500]  In the universe, but only rearranging things in space.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.021]  It's a crazy thesis.
[01:42:04.361 --> 01:42:10.383]  You find that in Fonmises' book of 1912, his main theoretical treatise.
[01:42:10.463 --> 01:42:13.744]  So, what you need is industrial economics.
[01:42:13.864 --> 01:42:17.285]  And this is a school that never mentions the word production.
[01:42:17.765 --> 01:42:19.285]  They don't talk about production.
[01:42:19.345 --> 01:42:22.947]  They talk about money supply and all the rest of this.
[01:42:23.207 --> 01:42:25.447]  Basically, it's up in a never-never land.
[01:42:25.487 --> 01:42:27.468]  In other words, it's profoundly unrealistic.
[01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:39.476]  Why we should turn from the American school of Hamilton and Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, which is the most successful in the world, to the Austrian school, which is a failure.
[01:42:39.516 --> 01:42:42.859]  I mean, is Austria a model of economic success?
[01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:43.860]  I don't think so.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.602]  But America was, and could be again.
[01:42:46.676 --> 01:42:47.957]  All right, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:47.977 --> 01:42:50.980]  We're going to continue to take your calls in the last ten minutes of the program.
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:57.506]  If you missed any of the broadcasts today, remember we rebroadcast everything over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:07.705 --> 01:43:11.987]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:43:12.227 --> 01:43:17.129]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:43:17.329 --> 01:43:18.669]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:43:18.829 --> 01:43:22.311]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:43:45.144 --> 01:43:46.745]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[01:43:47.045 --> 01:43:48.106]  And I save big time.

[01:44:15.970 --> 01:44:17.210]  The late, great USA.
[01:44:17.471 --> 01:44:18.872]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:44:19.232 --> 01:44:26.077]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:46:06.318 --> 01:46:15.942]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:15.962 --> 01:46:24.046]  Yesterday we played a really quick clip of the FX program Rescue Me where Daniel Sinjada big ups to Daniel.
[01:46:26.107 --> 01:46:30.089]  Had a two and a half minute tirade for 9-11 Truth, and it was just awesome.
[01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:37.294]  Well, there's a new FX program that premiered last night called The Beast, and they slandered 9-11 Truth in that.
[01:46:38.826 --> 01:46:51.837]  They have a 9-11 truther come on, he starts talking a little bit of truth, but then they bring in the wacky no-planes, CGI planes, butter planes theory in there, and really, and this is the guy that, I guess the guy is like the crack smoker on the program.
[01:46:51.877 --> 01:46:54.239]  He shot himself in the foot while trying to play Russian roulette.
[01:46:54.259 --> 01:46:59.844]  So the major idiot of the program is pro-9-11 truth and talking ridiculous CGI theories.
[01:47:00.825 --> 01:47:07.730]  We have Webster Griffin Tarpley with us, and he is the author of Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, and of course, Obama, the Postmodern Coup.
[01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:10.331]  You can get that over at Infowars.com.
[01:47:10.351 --> 01:47:13.453]  We're going to fly through your calls right now for Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:47:14.154 --> 01:47:17.516]  Let's go to Chad, who's out in very cold Albany, New York.
[01:47:17.556 --> 01:47:18.316]  Chad, what's on your mind?
[01:47:18.336 --> 01:47:19.977]  Hey, Jason.
[01:47:20.017 --> 01:47:20.478]  How are you?
[01:47:20.818 --> 01:47:21.138]  Good, man.
[01:47:21.158 --> 01:47:21.518]  How you doing?
[01:47:22.339 --> 01:47:22.619]  Good.
[01:47:22.639 --> 01:47:24.420]  I've got two points, trying to make them quick.
[01:47:25.321 --> 01:47:28.423]  Rahm Emanuel's plan to make it compulsory to do
[01:47:29.099 --> 01:47:30.760]  National Service, whatever that means.
[01:47:31.381 --> 01:47:33.282]  That would have to be approved by Congress first.
[01:47:33.322 --> 01:47:35.744]  They couldn't just backdoor that through an executive order, right?
[01:47:36.205 --> 01:47:36.445]  Right.
[01:47:37.405 --> 01:47:37.726]  Correct.
[01:47:38.686 --> 01:47:40.268]  And the second thing is, they have the votes.
[01:47:41.128 --> 01:47:41.268]  Right.
[01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:41.829]  Yeah, they do.
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:56.180]  Although, would it really... I wouldn't put it past Congress to pass that, because they have the huge majority now, and they worship the ground Obama walks on, so any idea he comes up with must be brilliant, right?
[01:47:56.468 --> 01:48:00.251]  Yeah, and the House, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, is a total hawk.
[01:48:00.271 --> 01:48:04.615]  You know, she's been in with this, not only the Bush administration, but this administration for quite some time.
[01:48:04.675 --> 01:48:07.297]  She headed up the initial congressional investigation.
[01:48:07.337 --> 01:48:09.439]  She was the lead Democrat of 9-11.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.162]  You know, Pelosi is not a good person, is she, Webster?
[01:48:13.082 --> 01:48:16.265]  No, she's a monster, and she ought to be out.
[01:48:16.345 --> 01:48:18.127]  But remember, these people are
[01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:36.243]  Totalitarians, in the sense that they believe, whether they know it or not, what they believe in is the Mussolini fascist corporate state, and they believe in forms of national mobilization, such as the so-called voluntary labor service that we saw in Germany in the 1930s, which was not voluntary at all.
[01:48:36.364 --> 01:48:43.649]  So the point is, the ability to get this stuff through is, I think, going to be largely concentrated in 100 days.
[01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.432]  In other words, from January 20th to about May 1st.
[01:48:47.082 --> 01:48:48.663]  You gotta try to fight a holding action.
[01:48:48.923 --> 01:48:55.128]  If you can stop Obama in a hundred days, after that he will crater, as Biden predicted.
[01:48:55.168 --> 01:49:03.635]  In other words, his economics will be so unpopular that he'll be hated within a very few months, and at that point it'll become much harder for him to get this stuff through.
[01:49:03.695 --> 01:49:06.237]  So what you want to do, ultimately, is gridlock.
[01:49:06.597 --> 01:49:10.500]  Gridlock and partisanship, and stop this stuff from going through.
[01:49:10.921 --> 01:49:15.064]  And I urge everybody to mobilize now, as you've never mobilized before, between January 20th
[01:49:15.743 --> 01:49:15.983]  I think?
[01:49:37.515 --> 01:49:40.900]  Hi, Webster, your podcast is really awesome and I encourage people to listen to it.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:41.120]  Thank you!
[01:49:56.331 --> 01:49:57.692]  College credit for listening to it.
[01:49:59.673 --> 01:50:01.974]  I don't have any college credit to give, I'm sorry.
[01:50:02.274 --> 01:50:03.415]  Quickly, Ken, what's your point?
[01:50:03.515 --> 01:50:21.844]  Okay, there's an article today from Kurt Nemo about the Pentagon paper that said they were equating, well not equating, but saying Mexico and Pakistan could collapse and then, not presented, but there was a video out there that a Mexican broadcaster
[01:50:23.055 --> 01:50:28.139]  Talking about the collapse of Mexico, I gotta let you go just because we're in the last 30 seconds of the program.
[01:50:28.339 --> 01:50:28.839]  I got it.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:29.220]  Go for it.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:33.403]  The existence of the United States of America is a historical achievement of the first water.
[01:50:33.443 --> 01:50:36.265]  Don't let little George Bush sour you on it.
[01:50:36.325 --> 01:50:43.090]  So, no subversion, no secessionism, territorial integrity, constitutional government, and economic recovery.
[01:50:43.411 --> 01:50:46.613]  And fight for it through the organs of government that we have in our Constitution.
[01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:49.635]  Thank you for listening to TCA.
[01:50:53.044 --> 01:50:55.368]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:57.331 --> 01:50:58.934]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:59.034 --> 01:51:03.601]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:03.781 --> 01:51:04.843]  We need to be independent.
