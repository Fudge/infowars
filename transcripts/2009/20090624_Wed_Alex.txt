[00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:06.174]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:07.935]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:09.696]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:11.277]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.838]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:17.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:26.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:28.247]  It is Wednesday, the 24th day.
[00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:31.952]  of June 2009.
[00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:37.238]  And we're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.921]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:40.662]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:41.703]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:43.805]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:44.186]  Eastern.
[00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:45.747]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:46.772 --> 00:01:10.311]  Paul Joseph Watson, editor and analyst over at PrisonPlanet.com, will be joining us, detailing an excellent breakdown he's done on the latest developments inside the staged events, the circus that is going on in Iran, leading towards the military bombardment of the nation, if the globalists have their way.
[00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.434]  So we'll be going over that coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.316]  Then we have David Jones,
[00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:23.428]  Pastor David Jones and Dean Broyles coming on the transmission.
[00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:27.169]  They were out in San Diego, remember, a month or so ago?
[00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:34.531]  And the zoning inspector showed up, taking photos of their house, trying to interrogate the guy's wife, ordering her to answer questions.
[00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.352]  No more Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:38.652]  Saying, you're not allowed to have prayer services.
[00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:40.273]  Do you say the name of God?
[00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:41.213]  Do you say Amen?
[00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:45.794]  And they said, yes, and they said, all right, we're going to start fighting you.
[00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:48.315]  There wasn't even a law.
[00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.456]  This is how they roll.
[00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:54.638]  Just like they get on the news and say, everyone must take whatever vaccines the drug companies say.
[00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:55.798]  It is the law.
[00:01:55.798 --> 00:01:59.800]  There is no law, not in any state, not in any city.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.961]  In the United States, you've got to take vaccines.
[00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:05.182]  It's all a giant hoax.
[00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:09.544]  And when you find out most zoning laws are hoaxes, or don't exist, or are
[00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:15.305]  Applied when you find out there's no law to take vaccines.
[00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:23.869]  It's all based on con artist fraud, but they will still send you to prison for not even breaking a law.
[00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:30.051]  They send people to jail for political signs in their yards under zoning when they're not even under the zoning.
[00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.633]  They arrest people for giving police Ron Paul videos and take them to trial.
[00:02:34.793 --> 00:02:37.275]  This is how America operates, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:43.480]  They'll say you gave somebody a Ron- this is on record- a Ron Paul video of him speaking on the House floor.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:52.388]  That's a threat to police, and they call it terroristic threats to police, and then they impanel a jury and they try to send you to prison.
[00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:55.591]  That was the case of, of course, Kelly Rushing, Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:02:57.452 --> 00:02:58.532]  There's many of these.
[00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.153]  This is a criminal, rogue government.
[00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:10.135]  I mean, you think there's a law against police pulling you over in Texas and Alabama and Florida and Oklahoma and just grabbing the cash right out of your wallet?
[00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:14.176]  Pistol-whipping you if you argue?
[00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:15.136]  They just do it!
[00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:17.877]  They go on TV and say, yeah, we do it!
[00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:18.937]  We got the weapons!
[00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:19.557]  We rule you!
[00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:23.179]  Has this happened in the Old West?
[00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.801]  Happened over and over again in New York and Boston with corrupt police forces?
[00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:30.283]  The citizens sometimes have to physically throw them out?
[00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:34.946]  But see, they got modern propaganda that said nobody in blue can do wrong.
[00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.127]  Nobody in the government can do wrong.
[00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:39.028]  Obama cannot lie.
[00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:40.829]  George W. Bush cannot lie.
[00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.911]  The CIA never lies when their charter is to lie.
[00:03:47.472 --> 00:04:02.141]  By the way, Paul Watson has written a big article about Obama yesterday saying in a press conference that it's ridiculous and just saying it's preposterous.
[00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.623]  I mean, it's like saying a penguin is black and white.
[00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.384]  It's like saying the sun is yellow.
[00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:08.486]  It's like saying water is wet.
[00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:13.629]  It's like saying... It's just insane.
[00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.571]  It's like saying nice cold Coca-Cola after you mowed the lawn.
[00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:24.751]  It's delicious, it's just so crazy.
[00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:30.114]  That's right, it's insane to say the CIA is involved in Iran in any way, or involved in this.
[00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:34.017]  They're just publicly on record doing it.
[00:04:34.017 --> 00:04:40.781]  And he's not from Kenya, and his daddy wasn't a communist, and Clinton didn't have sex with that woman.
[00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:46.580]  And Africa tried to ship yellowcake uranium to Saddam.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.365]  He's got WMDs in Iraq!
[00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:54.408]  And a lone gunman killed Kennedy too!
[00:04:54.408 --> 00:04:57.631]  Big show lined up for you today.
[00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.172]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:01.371]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:03.372]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:04.352]  Well, you should.
[00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:08.834]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:09.654]  That's right.
[00:05:09.654 --> 00:05:18.317]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:19.658]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:19.658 --> 00:05:20.798]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:21.018 --> 00:05:27.001]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:33.885]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:39.408]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:40.869]  This is real.
[00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:41.929]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:48.793]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.474]  And get your free handgun.
[00:05:50.474 --> 00:05:52.856]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:56.539]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.062]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:06.887]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:13.852]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:21.052]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:23.014]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:25.516]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:36.486]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:38.755]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:40.616]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:47.541]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:55.786]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:57.367]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.367 --> 00:06:58.568]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:01.762]  Economy have you down?
[00:07:01.762 --> 00:07:03.462]  Scared you might lose your job?
[00:07:03.462 --> 00:07:05.543]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[00:07:05.543 --> 00:07:07.644]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:10.966]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:15.488]  Robert Beadle's new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:19.049]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book.
[00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:19.950]  And the best part?
[00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.990]  This book is priced under $10.
[00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.891]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!
[00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:26.012]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.873]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:27.873 --> 00:07:29.154]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:30.594]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:07.057]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.984 --> 00:08:47.771]  The global engineers, the people building the planetary government, the control grid, the eugenics extermination, crucible, the technological terror, the dehumanizing mechanisms, the scientific dictatorship are moving on all fronts.
[00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:51.912]  Anti-Second Amendment bills are racing through the House and Senate.
[00:08:52.856 --> 00:09:05.082]  Giant carbon tax, micromanagement, complete internationalization, not just federalization, of every industry, every state in the United States, and every other major nation, is racing.
[00:09:05.082 --> 00:09:18.828]  Total government takeover, so they can operate their eugenics systems, and the government can engage in medicine, not doctors, is racing through the legislative process.
[00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:31.155]  They're gearing up for confrontation with Iran, Syria, Russia, Pakistan, North Korea.
[00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:32.756]  Everything is in flux.
[00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:36.238]  Everything is in motion now.
[00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:39.220]  We have reached jump point.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.962]  And things are only going to move quicker from here on out.
[00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:46.524]  If we speak up, if we stand up, if we
[00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:52.569]  Culture Jam, the globalist disinformation operations.
[00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:55.130]  We may be able to stop them starting World War III.
[00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:04.876]  The Rand Corporation and others and every major financial expert and political expert and congressmen and women we have on here tell you the globalists are planning to launch a worldwide war.
[00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:10.208]  As a pretext to bring in their world government.
[00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:11.568]  It's on paper.
[00:10:11.568 --> 00:10:12.989]  The globalists admit it.
[00:10:12.989 --> 00:10:25.614]  They're so arrogant and think the public is so dumbed down watching their football and basketball and baseball and just trying to make ends meet and putting their kids on Prozac and Ritalin that they're not going to pay attention to what's happening.
[00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:43.269]  The establishment can bring us into crises, economic, societal, military, so big that people will get into such fear, they'll just sit back and say, okay, we're turning off the thinking process, we'll do whatever you want.
[00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:44.850]  You want to put youth brigades on the streets?
[00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.491]  You want to put tattletale squads on the streets?
[00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:57.756]  You want to have federalized, local, private groups that forcibly inspect your home and ranches and farms and control every facet of your life and do environmental audits weekly on you?
[00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:00.017]  Do it.
[00:11:00.017 --> 00:11:03.200]  Because most of you out there are going to have jobs in this grid.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:14.808]  They're converting the old wreckage of the free market that the establishment used to consolidate power into a vertically integrated parasite economy, a police state economy, owned by them.
[00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:15.889]  Complete conversion.
[00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:25.243]  See, first they get you de-industrialized and dependent on a global system and a mercantile system where different forms of manufacturing are in different sectors of the world.
[00:11:25.243 --> 00:11:26.304]  This is on record.
[00:11:26.304 --> 00:11:27.725]  David Rockefeller brags about it.
[00:11:27.725 --> 00:11:40.496]  They put out movies in the 70s, throwing it in your face, how they run it like rollerball, where this city's energy and that city's finance and this city's manufacturing and this city's media
[00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:45.710]  Where they're phasing out the books and everything's on the computers.
[00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.731]  And in the first phase, they let there be free information, only to destroy the old infrastructure of paper media.
[00:11:51.731 --> 00:12:02.153]  Then they're going to clamp down and shut down the free internet and only have certain control grid news, where there'll be no local media to even counteract what's coming in from the central command systems.
[00:12:02.153 --> 00:12:04.954]  It's all a master game of
[00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:21.468]  Advanced megachess with tens of thousands of pieces in flow, algorithm computers with specialized idiot savants in key positions running the game.
[00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:28.495]  With overall generalist masterminds coordinating amongst themselves and fine-tuning a master program.
[00:12:31.365 --> 00:12:36.529]  It is a formidable group of master psychopaths operating against free humanity.
[00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:52.520]  But if you break your conditioning, turn on your innate survival mode, jack in to the higher levels of cognitive analysis, realize it's game on, realize the game they're playing, the system you're in, you can learn it very quick.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.181]  There are more of us than there are of them.
[00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:59.484]  And we can defeat the matrix grid that's being set up.
[00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:04.789]  This is the beginning of the matrix being built.
[00:13:04.789 --> 00:13:09.412]  And I don't mean the matrix they're talking about, I mean the Pentagon matrix.
[00:13:09.412 --> 00:13:11.854]  Just Google that.
[00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:19.641]  You'll read documents from the 60s where they describe a matrix of control, a matrix of false news, a matrix of disinformation.
[00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:26.979]  The head of CIA counterintelligence.
[00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:39.734]  I was watching a documentary from the 90s on History Channel called Inside the CIA and there they were admitting the matrix false reality grid they're trying to lay down over the world and the American people.
[00:13:39.734 --> 00:13:44.060]  Where they feed on their own people and live in a culture of lies and deceit and fear.
[00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.430]  Or they burn their own minions.
[00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.551]  And the CIA itself is just one titular head of a larger complex.
[00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:57.653]  Most of the real intelligence and spying and murdering and espionage being carried out by private merc forces.
[00:13:57.653 --> 00:14:02.854]  And they wear $4,000 suits.
[00:14:02.854 --> 00:14:07.615]  They fly around the world in their Gulfstream jets.
[00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:13.817]  And they lay siege to free humanity.
[00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:14.797]  So that's coming up today.
[00:14:16.994 --> 00:14:18.915]  Climate bill set for vote.
[00:14:18.915 --> 00:14:22.077]  Deal is reached in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:14:22.077 --> 00:14:23.078]  Rupert Murdoch owned.
[00:14:23.078 --> 00:14:28.741]  Rupert Murdoch on record pledging his entire media empire to set up the global carbon tax.
[00:14:28.741 --> 00:14:33.383]  And the media puts out these little narratives to manipulate people, especially women.
[00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:40.628]  Oh, he didn't believe in it till his wife, his new wife, convinced him and now he cares about the Earth.
[00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:42.529]  Now he's a mouthpiece for the Rothschild
[00:14:43.843 --> 00:14:49.948]  Rockefeller-Saxe-Coburg-Gotha crime syndicate.
[00:14:49.948 --> 00:14:53.091]  The NFL says global warming's real.
[00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:58.896]  ExxonMobil says it's real and calls for world tax and they're going to give it to you.
[00:14:58.896 --> 00:15:04.902]  This is absolute bondage where you will pay your taxes directly into the coffers.
[00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.136]  of private interest.
[00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:09.878]  Hundreds of new taxing private authorities.
[00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:10.718]  Government money.
[00:15:10.718 --> 00:15:12.038]  Federal, state, international.
[00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:18.061]  Your tax money going to build Al Gore's new tin can car company.
[00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:18.621]  And why not?
[00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:21.562]  Why shouldn't he say he invented the internet when he had nothing to do with it?
[00:15:21.562 --> 00:15:27.705]  Why shouldn't he say global warming's man-made when it's the sun and a normal twelve-year cycle?
[00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:28.725]  Why shouldn't he?
[00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:32.847]  Why shouldn't he say he built the earth?
[00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:35.368]  They say that Kim Jong-il's father
[00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:40.935]  Basically created the planet in North Korea.
[00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:43.416]  Why not have total insanity?
[00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:47.659]  Why not just believe anything?
[00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:53.381]  I give you the analogy, the parable, the parallel of the Aztecs.
[00:15:53.381 --> 00:16:00.305]  Just one dominant group in the Mayan civilization at the end of its golden era and its collapse.
[00:16:01.783 --> 00:16:16.437]  And if you were teleported back a thousand years ago and saw the smoke rising and people sacrificing their own children, hundreds and hundreds a day, but that was the main meat supply, and that the priest class funded themselves predominantly off the sale of human flesh in the markets,
[00:16:17.662 --> 00:16:22.926]  You would think that was insane, but if you were there amongst those lunatics, you would be the lunatic.
[00:16:22.926 --> 00:16:34.836]  This is the key to it, and Karl Rove, when he was in front of the New York Times and the Washington Post at a cocktail party, they said, but hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are dead.
[00:16:34.836 --> 00:16:36.497]  This was only a year and a half into the invasion.
[00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:38.099]  Now it's over a million, 300,000.
[00:16:38.099 --> 00:16:41.862]  And it really, there were no WMDs, and he said, you don't get it.
[00:16:41.862 --> 00:16:42.522]  He laughed at him.
[00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:44.364]  He said, you don't count anymore.
[00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:45.605]  Even you, our slaves, don't.
[00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:53.376]  We tell you what reality is today, you go report it, and then tomorrow we'll completely change it again and you'll do it, because you don't count.
[00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:55.716]  We're history's actors now.
[00:16:55.716 --> 00:17:08.779]  And the arrogant, power-tripping New York Times, Washington Post, Black Op, CIA Nellies didn't like hearing they weren't important anymore.
[00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:11.360]  That it wasn't a nuanced twisting of society.
[00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:17.915]  That the old facade of, oh, well, we're still the good guys, and if we don't take over, somebody else will.
[00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:21.137]  No, it was all, look, it's all false reality, Winston.
[00:17:21.137 --> 00:17:23.138]  Shut up and report whatever I say!
[00:17:23.138 --> 00:17:33.164]  If 24 hours ago we say we've always been at war with East Asia, and when I tell you 24 hours later we've never been at war with East Asia, you're gonna report it!
[00:17:33.164 --> 00:17:34.085]  You understand?
[00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:36.126]  You're just a monkey, a grocer.
[00:17:36.126 --> 00:17:37.327]  You do what I say.
[00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:37.967]  You understand?
[00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:39.048]  You don't count.
[00:17:39.048 --> 00:17:40.809]  You don't like hearing that, do you, spooks?
[00:17:43.223 --> 00:17:49.616]  You don't like not feeling important when I get up here on air and I tell you they're shooting you up full of cancer viruses and mercury.
[00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:50.237]  It's a fact!
[00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.851]  Just Google cancer viruses and vaccines.
[00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:55.191]  You'll have every mainstream article.
[00:17:55.191 --> 00:18:17.781]  You can imagine all these, oh, we don't know why these viruses were in there and it does cause cancer, but oh, the government, oh, there's got, caught the UN sterilizing women at health clinics again in Africa, and it's tied into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, oh, and Bill Gates' daddy just used to be the head of Planned Parenthood and still on the board, and he was in Army Intelligence, oh.
[00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:24.544]  IBM's a giant, Microsoft's a giant, all of them are big, giant eugenics wrecking crews!
[00:18:24.544 --> 00:18:36.049]  And you think, up there in your little office at the New York Times, or your little office at the Austin American Statesman, little CIA editors, you think you're immune from it.
[00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:41.471]  Well, it's sad to have to kill the Africans and the Latin Americans and cull them.
[00:18:41.471 --> 00:18:45.013]  But you know that it's for the Earth and it's for resources.
[00:18:45.013 --> 00:18:45.653]  Hey, dummy!
[00:18:48.038 --> 00:18:51.761]  You're under attack too, Dumbo.
[00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:54.363]  See, you're not a pet puppy.
[00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:56.564]  Like Mark Hornky likes to say, it's a good term.
[00:18:56.564 --> 00:19:01.408]  You're not a pet puppy either.
[00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:03.870]  Oh, a lot of you were just control freaks on power trips.
[00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.312]  You're not real psychopaths.
[00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:11.235]  Oh, but you're in a psycho's game now.
[00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:15.739]  Oh, you like to exercise power over the people under you.
[00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.300]  But you're starting to figure out.
[00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:26.218]  It's your part of something real nasty now, aren't ya?
[00:19:26.218 --> 00:19:28.999]  Oh, and the arrogant, yuppie laugh.
[00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:31.299]  The fake self-assuredness.
[00:19:31.299 --> 00:19:33.199]  That rings hollow, doesn't it, right now?
[00:19:33.199 --> 00:19:34.740]  Mm-hmm.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.981]  Tell you what, go ahead and go on in there to the office and drink some tap water.
[00:19:39.981 --> 00:19:43.442]  Show yourself, Alex is a liar.
[00:19:43.442 --> 00:19:44.522]  Come on, taste it.
[00:19:44.522 --> 00:19:46.903]  Taste all the poisons and chemicals.
[00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:47.823]  Drink a big, big
[00:19:49.704 --> 00:19:50.945]  Picture of it!
[00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:52.626]  Have a big migraine headache tonight.
[00:19:52.626 --> 00:19:54.307]  Tell yourself it was good for you.
[00:19:54.307 --> 00:19:56.508]  The government loves you!
[00:19:56.508 --> 00:20:00.631]  You're part of the elite!

[00:23:00.737 --> 00:23:06.759]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:12.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.802]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:21.104]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:21.104 --> 00:23:23.566]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:23.566 --> 00:23:36.756]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:38.437]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:38.437 --> 00:23:40.299]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:46.524]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:47.193 --> 00:23:55.457]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:57.018]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:57.018 --> 00:23:58.239]  The people strike back.
[00:24:06.425 --> 00:24:08.607]  Alright, we've got Paul Watson coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.023]  Breakdown what's happening in Iran.
[00:24:38.023 --> 00:24:42.906]  We'll get into what the psychopathic zoning people are doing around the country.
[00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:45.609]  This is all internationally written, internationally standardized.
[00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:50.112]  This is one of the biggest forms of tyranny coming down on our Republic.
[00:24:50.112 --> 00:24:52.534]  They steal a lot of old people's homes here in Austin.
[00:24:52.534 --> 00:24:59.160]  They've got a record of when they've had a heart attack or when they're dying of cancer and then they come and fine them $2,000 a day for three inch grass and then they
[00:25:01.704 --> 00:25:07.926]  Have the city come in and steal the property and then semi-secret auctions give it to local officials.
[00:25:07.926 --> 00:25:08.747]  It's how they roll.
[00:25:08.747 --> 00:25:13.748]  It's how the black ops... How the black ops roll here in the Mafia America.
[00:25:13.748 --> 00:25:19.010]  Oh, and I've gone and named names and done TV programs about it here locally and they just say, yeah, that's how it is.
[00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.671]  We're going to take everything you got and hope you like it.
[00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:28.954]  And under the new global system with the new carbon credits and the carbon inspectors in your home, it's going to be under international force of law.
[00:25:31.673 --> 00:25:36.077]  You cannot exaggerate how evil and criminal-filled government is.
[00:25:36.077 --> 00:25:54.972]  And boy, everybody's going to love new government health care, where they set the standards and the feds have already federalized all the prescriptions and tell the doctors what they can and can't do off these computer terminals they've got to file everything on.
[00:25:54.972 --> 00:25:58.615]  And you like the VA medicine, and you like the
[00:26:00.902 --> 00:26:09.627]  Medical System of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the great sterilization and eugenics medical care they get.
[00:26:09.627 --> 00:26:11.228]  Hell, it's mainstream news in the U.S.
[00:26:11.228 --> 00:26:12.389]  and Canada.
[00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:19.553]  The Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Affairs, they don't even just sterilize little boys and girls.
[00:26:19.553 --> 00:26:21.013]  A lot of times they just kill them.
[00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:22.794]  That's even in the Canadian news.
[00:26:22.794 --> 00:26:23.415]  Still going on.
[00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:34.141]  See, the really smart, hardcore racists, they don't run around with big Nazi swastikas on their arms, yelling, Heil Hitler.
[00:26:34.141 --> 00:26:37.962]  They wear sandals and have ponytails.
[00:26:37.962 --> 00:26:40.903]  And they're so loving to the blacks.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.361]  Well, we got a guest, by the way, in the last hour to come on and cover all of that.
[00:26:46.361 --> 00:26:50.662]  You can call Planned Parenthood up and say, I'd like to fund the murder of black babies.
[00:26:50.662 --> 00:26:51.763]  Specifically, I hate blacks.
[00:26:51.763 --> 00:26:53.303]  And they're like, oh, we nunders.
[00:26:53.303 --> 00:26:54.964]  Oh, yes, give the money.
[00:26:54.964 --> 00:26:58.125]  We'll allot it specifically to get rid of blacks.
[00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:04.847]  And then you get to read in Time Magazine and Newsweek every few years how great Margaret Sanger is and how much she loves the blacks.
[00:27:07.227 --> 00:27:13.471]  And the media teaches you, you know, that if somebody says something like, I don't like Barack Obama, then you hate all blacks.
[00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:16.753]  When he's not even African, he's six percent.
[00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:20.415]  But see, if you're actually murdering black people, oh!
[00:27:20.415 --> 00:27:22.916]  Oh, how liberal!
[00:27:22.916 --> 00:27:23.156]  Oh!
[00:27:23.156 --> 00:27:28.059]  Oh, so sweet!
[00:27:28.059 --> 00:27:30.681]  So you like the Veterans Affairs and you like the
[00:27:34.622 --> 00:27:37.869]  Bureau of Indian Affairs and all the great medical care they give them?
[00:27:41.638 --> 00:27:43.138]  You like government health care?
[00:27:43.138 --> 00:27:51.000]  Well, you're going to get it, and you're going to get carbon taxes, and you're going to get all the water supply seized by the feds and the Federal Reserve.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.200]  It's federal in name only.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.001]  It doesn't even need all these new bills they're passing piecemeal.
[00:27:55.001 --> 00:27:58.342]  It's announcing total control over anything connected to the economy.
[00:27:58.342 --> 00:27:59.582]  Congress can't look into it.
[00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:00.762]  The President, no one.
[00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:04.643]  Pure dictatorship by the bankers, and they're getting all the laws in line for it.
[00:28:05.615 --> 00:28:12.237]  And the bureaucratic corps and the New York Times reports, well, thank God Obama's giving felons a chance.
[00:28:12.237 --> 00:28:16.999]  They're hiring felons to come inspect your home, part of the new Green Corps.
[00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:24.161]  Because felons, they know how to get the job done.
[00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.121]  Stalin knew that.
[00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:25.941]  Hitler knew that.
[00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:27.382]  Pol Pot knew that.
[00:28:27.382 --> 00:28:29.863]  Fidel Castro knew that.
[00:28:29.863 --> 00:28:31.083]  Julius Caesar knew that.
[00:28:32.503 --> 00:28:33.144]  And you know what?
[00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:36.166]  They're doing what it takes to get the economy back on track.
[00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:39.809]  And they're hiring felons and illegal aliens to fill the Army and Marine Corps.
[00:28:39.809 --> 00:28:41.090]  That's good, too!
[00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.731]  They got all these glorification pieces.
[00:28:42.731 --> 00:28:48.316]  Every time I turn CNN on, it seems they're glorifying, He lost his fingers in Iraq.
[00:28:48.316 --> 00:28:50.037]  And he wasn't even a citizen.
[00:28:50.037 --> 00:28:51.999]  Now he is.
[00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:53.320]  Oh, how wonderful.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:00.346]  I mean, they're not just like the British military kept the German mercenaries separate in separate divisions and separate corps.
[00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:04.342]  Now they just bring them right in.
[00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:12.345]  It would have been like if the redcoats were made up of the Hessian Mercs.
[00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:15.547]  Oh, they're felons too!
[00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:22.310]  The Washington Post did an article, so did the Washington Times years ago, about how great it was they were hiring aggravated felons for the military.
[00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.151]  That's who we need!
[00:29:24.151 --> 00:29:25.572]  The dirty dozen!
[00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:29.201]  Kelly's Heroes!
[00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:30.962]  Hollywood says it's good!
[00:29:30.962 --> 00:29:33.382]  They can get the job done!
[00:29:33.382 --> 00:29:36.623]  Thank goodness for them!
[00:29:36.623 --> 00:29:39.264]  Oh, look!
[00:29:39.264 --> 00:29:39.744]  Oh, look!
[00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:42.285]  They're wearing black and red uniforms!
[00:29:42.285 --> 00:29:45.106]  It's city year!
[00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:51.207]  And Obama fired his director of it because he didn't like the money laundering.
[00:29:51.207 --> 00:29:52.588]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.588 --> 00:29:54.108]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.123 --> 00:30:00.605]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.605 --> 00:30:02.306]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.306 --> 00:30:07.048]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:07.048 --> 00:30:09.989]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:30:09.989 --> 00:30:13.050]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:17.772]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:30:17.932 --> 00:30:18.152]  We're good.
[00:30:37.768 --> 00:30:44.031]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:30:44.031 --> 00:30:51.194]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:51.194 --> 00:30:55.396]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:56.537]  Take action today.
[00:30:56.537 --> 00:31:01.119]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:03.600]  It is a big idea.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.361]  A new world order.
[00:31:05.361 --> 00:31:05.941]  In the near future.
[00:31:07.156 --> 00:31:09.837]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:09.837 --> 00:31:12.198]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:31:12.198 --> 00:31:15.860]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.042]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.042 --> 00:31:26.345]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:34.824]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.824 --> 00:31:38.706]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.706 --> 00:31:41.268]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.268 --> 00:31:42.429]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:43.209]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.209 --> 00:31:44.490]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.491]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:46.632]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:31:46.632 --> 00:31:51.395]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:31:51.395 --> 00:31:55.337]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.337 --> 00:31:58.159]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.240]  You have been warned.
[00:32:00.741 --> 00:32:03.743]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.743 --> 00:32:09.087]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.087 --> 00:32:11.128]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.128 --> 00:32:15.912]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.152 --> 00:32:17.032]  How much do you want?
[00:32:36.638 --> 00:32:36.998]  We're good!
[00:33:09.838 --> 00:33:20.663]  You know, when I first got into this, 15 years ago, 16 years ago, I was going to city council meetings.
[00:33:40.426 --> 00:33:55.038]  Kind of mainline Republican, defend the Second Amendment, don't let the City Council steal all these ranches and farms, claiming it was for the water supply on the aquifer and then turning around and openly taking the building restrictions off after they had seized the property.
[00:33:56.537 --> 00:34:05.625]  And building hotels, golf courses, five-star resorts, huge developments openly run by the city council people and mayors.
[00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:09.728]  Just absolute criminal activity in everybody's face.
[00:34:09.728 --> 00:34:19.516]  I got involved and then 14 years ago got on AXS TV and then a year later in 1996 got a radio show here locally.
[00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:21.437]  Fell right in my lap.
[00:34:21.437 --> 00:34:22.939]  They were about to switch formats from
[00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:31.055]  Rock and Roll to Talk on 98.9 KJFK.
[00:34:31.055 --> 00:34:37.898]  It's Spanish music now.
[00:34:37.898 --> 00:34:41.280]  Not even the kind I like, the mariachi music.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.862]  It's like that pop stuff.
[00:34:43.862 --> 00:34:48.404]  I don't like English pop really either, so c'est la vie.
[00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:50.325]  The issue is, the point is,
[00:34:51.417 --> 00:35:09.090]  That when I got on the air, I knew about the Federal Reserve and the New World Order and a little bit about eugenics, and I thought it was amazing levels of evil and corruption, and I knew maybe one, one hundredth, maybe, of what I knew now.
[00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:14.334]  And everything I talk about is documented and on the record, folks, and I'm sorry it sounds horrific and horrifying.
[00:35:14.334 --> 00:35:16.356]  It's admitted fact.
[00:35:19.301 --> 00:35:31.025]  And we're going into a totally engineered, totally managed, organized, top-down society that will make the Soviet Union and Mao's China look freewheeling and libertarian.
[00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:33.626]  And when I say that, I mean it.
[00:35:33.626 --> 00:35:39.608]  And the evidence is legion.
[00:35:39.608 --> 00:35:46.271]  Now, I'm gonna go over climate bill set for vote after deal is reached, Wall Street Journal.
[00:35:47.324 --> 00:35:51.327]  ABC News, Obama, we will get healthcare reform this year.
[00:35:51.327 --> 00:35:52.447]  Reform.
[00:35:52.447 --> 00:35:54.369]  People think of the word reform as good.
[00:35:54.369 --> 00:36:00.653]  If you run out in front of a Mack truck and it splatters you all over the cement, hitting you at 80 miles an hour, you're reformed.
[00:36:00.653 --> 00:36:02.254]  Reform just means change.
[00:36:02.254 --> 00:36:04.496]  See, but they've changed the semantical meaning.
[00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.237]  People are like, oh, I want it fixed!
[00:36:06.237 --> 00:36:07.698]  I want some free healthcare!
[00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:14.162]  And Obama's like, you know, only 20% don't have it, and I know 80% don't want it, but, you know, we gotta take care of people.
[00:36:14.162 --> 00:36:17.004]  They're not gonna take care of you, they're gonna give you eugenics!
[00:36:18.525 --> 00:36:22.567]  You're going to get an aspirin for a heart attack like the Native Americans get.
[00:36:22.567 --> 00:36:25.248]  You're going to get sterilized.
[00:36:25.248 --> 00:36:26.629]  Oh, you want your health care, ma'am?
[00:36:26.629 --> 00:36:30.711]  Well, the CPS has got to talk to you first about this baby you're about to have.
[00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:32.872]  I mean, this is what it means.
[00:36:32.872 --> 00:36:34.973]  Oh God, I don't want to go into bondage, folks.
[00:36:34.973 --> 00:36:36.254]  I hate these people.
[00:36:36.254 --> 00:36:38.035]  I hate how they get away with all this corruption.
[00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:39.375]  It's a sick joke!
[00:36:39.375 --> 00:36:41.336]  How much more do they have to get away with?
[00:36:41.336 --> 00:36:42.637]  You think government's bad now?
[00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:44.458]  You ain't seen nothing yet!
[00:36:45.882 --> 00:36:47.463]  This is real!
[00:36:47.463 --> 00:36:48.643]  I mean what I'm saying.
[00:36:48.643 --> 00:36:51.045]  I said what I meant.
[00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:53.546]  And I'm faithful 100%, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:53.546 --> 00:36:58.688]  I document everything at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:05.272]  And then we're going to get into all the water grabbing and everything else and take your calls and the zoning, trying to take everybody's property and harassing everybody.
[00:37:05.272 --> 00:37:05.792]  I mean, it just...
[00:37:07.395 --> 00:37:09.396]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:23.900]  I couldn't believe it when I found out they were stealing old people's houses in Austin, that they had a database of when they were critically ill with cancer or heart attacks and when they were either widowed or widower or single.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:32.342]  And they have special units of cops that come around and arrest the old people and then they put liens on their houses and foreclose on them.
[00:37:32.342 --> 00:37:34.763]  They'll run up in two weeks a $14,000 bill on Rolling Ellington.
[00:37:38.584 --> 00:37:42.725]  I mean, these people are as criminal as hell itself!
[00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:46.066]  I just can't believe... and that was 15 years ago!
[00:37:46.066 --> 00:37:56.508]  I just hate these... they just get away with evil, and I gotta watch TV ads and everything, worshipping the government, paid for with our tax money.
[00:37:56.508 --> 00:37:57.489]  It's broke.
[00:37:57.489 --> 00:37:58.529]  We're disgusting.
[00:37:58.529 --> 00:37:59.369]  We're filthy.
[00:37:59.369 --> 00:38:00.909]  Let's admit what we are.
[00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:04.590]  Have some mourning for what we've turned into.
[00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.271]  Have some repentance so we can change what we've turned into.
[00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:18.610]  And then there's this.
[00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:25.452]  I'm going to cover this first for the next 20 minutes with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:38:25.452 --> 00:38:28.993]  Obama claims CIA involvement in Iran patently false.
[00:38:28.993 --> 00:38:30.434]  And we've got the clip.
[00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:31.854]  I forgot to send it to you guys.
[00:38:31.854 --> 00:38:35.255]  Well, you YouTube, Obama says CIA not in Iran.
[00:38:35.255 --> 00:38:36.476]  I meant to send it to you this morning.
[00:38:36.476 --> 00:38:41.337]  I forgot.
[00:38:41.337 --> 00:38:44.478]  Just so people can hear the guy saying it before we go over this because
[00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:56.229]  Because Paul Watson wrote a detailed two-page report that each paragraph's got links to their own admissions, but this doesn't even cover half of it.
[00:38:56.229 --> 00:39:08.218]  We need some master article, Paul, that then shows how the BBC put out fake photos and admits it, and how Bush put the executive order out to call for a revolution and destabilization.
[00:39:11.769 --> 00:39:18.092]  Because, I mean, you read Paul's article, it proves this is staged in Iran, but there's even more proof.
[00:39:18.092 --> 00:39:21.414]  And look, I don't have a dog in this fight.
[00:39:21.414 --> 00:39:22.794]  I don't like big government itself.
[00:39:22.794 --> 00:39:26.856]  Almost all government is extremely corrupt in all times in history.
[00:39:26.856 --> 00:39:30.038]  The Mullahs are involved in all sorts of corruption and controlling the economy.
[00:39:31.584 --> 00:39:34.266]  Profiting for their family's standard.
[00:39:34.266 --> 00:39:38.189]  Are they 1 100th as systematic as scientific and evil and tyranny?
[00:39:38.189 --> 00:39:38.690]  No.
[00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:43.173]  They actually rationalize what they do in their ideologues and believe in what they're doing.
[00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:45.435]  That's why the globalists absolutely hate them.
[00:39:45.435 --> 00:39:47.077]  They just absolutely can't stand them.
[00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:51.688]  And the governments are involved in all sorts of corruption and problems and we're on record about that.
[00:39:51.688 --> 00:39:55.990]  The point is, Iran's been overthrown twice by the United States and England, on record.
[00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.110]  That's a CIA history.
[00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.652]  You can go to CIA.gov and they brag about it.
[00:40:00.652 --> 00:40:03.133]  And how they staged terror attacks and blamed it on the government.
[00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:15.998]  Last time they staged terror attacks on Mosque, blamed it on Mohammed Mosaddegh, the secular leader, overthrew it, then double-crossed the Mullahs and put in the Shah, whose son they're trying to put in right now.
[00:40:15.998 --> 00:40:16.919]  And they're going to discredit
[00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:36.281]  This new guy who, it turns out, is the commander of the Beirut bombings, the attacks on the Marines, the real terrorist leader, but then before that, the foreign secretary agent to the U.S., so he's the guy involved in Iran-Contra too.
[00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:38.102]  So, this guy's a total spook.
[00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.848]  Well, Sally is a piece of work.
[00:40:44.848 --> 00:40:53.255]  So, I wanted Paul to chronicle all of this and run through it right now because he can do it in a measured, focused manner.
[00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:56.478]  I'm always pausing to gasp for breath just at how amazing this is.
[00:40:56.478 --> 00:41:09.789]  So, the bottom line is, that girl gets killed, people get killed, it's terrible, it's horrible, just like when the police shoot people in the face after the Red Sox victory and the young woman bleeds to death and the police seal the footage of that.
[00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:13.567]  They don't want to show you dead and dying Iraqis.
[00:41:13.567 --> 00:41:22.451]  They don't want to show you the globalist-funded Al-Qaeda blowing up mosques and school buses in Iran and the White House admitting they did it and Obama continuing what Bush did.
[00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:25.613]  That's on record!
[00:41:25.613 --> 00:41:28.134]  This is all meant not to bring down Iran.
[00:41:28.134 --> 00:41:36.498]  It's meant to create an image of demonization for the Iranian government so it can be toppled with military bombardment.
[00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:40.280]  And then even if the mullahs can stay in power, it will then knock them back to the Stone Age
[00:41:42.247 --> 00:41:43.568]  And that's what the globalists want.
[00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:52.952]  They don't want any industrialized first world nation, and Iran is a glistening, beautiful country, in many cases, that looks cleaner and more modern than Chicago or New York.
[00:41:52.952 --> 00:41:58.194]  They do not want it, and they want to blow it to kingdom come like they did Serbia.
[00:41:58.194 --> 00:42:05.658]  And they used Al-Qaeda to attack Serbia, and when Serbia fought back, they said, oh my gosh, look, they're murdering innocent Muslims.
[00:42:07.114 --> 00:42:09.216]  And it's a setup, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:09.216 --> 00:42:10.316]  It's a setup.
[00:42:10.316 --> 00:42:11.337]  It always is.
[00:42:11.337 --> 00:42:13.359]  It's divide and conquer.
[00:42:13.359 --> 00:42:19.563]  They use Sunni against Shiite in Iraq.
[00:42:19.563 --> 00:42:20.504]  And Shiite against
[00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.931]  Sunni and Iran.
[00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:24.951]  Sunni against Shiite.
[00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:25.592]  Same thing.
[00:42:25.592 --> 00:42:26.852]  Shiite against Sunni.
[00:42:26.852 --> 00:42:27.813]  Back and forth.
[00:42:27.813 --> 00:42:29.774]  All manipulation.
[00:42:29.774 --> 00:42:31.454]  All to knock that country out.
[00:42:31.454 --> 00:42:34.716]  And then a lot of Americans go, well that's why we stay on top!
[00:42:34.716 --> 00:42:36.757]  USA number one!
[00:42:36.757 --> 00:42:39.338]  We've been used to fund this.
[00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:40.158]  We get the blame.
[00:42:40.158 --> 00:42:43.920]  It's offshore globalists kamikaze-ing us into these countries.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.001]  Everybody knows the US and England are funding and running all this.
[00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:48.562]  And then Obama gets up on TV
[00:42:53.015 --> 00:42:56.036]  He gets up on TV and says, this is ridiculous.
[00:42:56.036 --> 00:43:12.864]  Paul Watson, I mean, Obama a month ago was doing overtures to Iran of peace, and I'm on record, I wish listeners would find the clip because I don't have a staff to do it, but I've been on the air over and over again, when he did that overture to Iran, I said, they're going to attack Iran or stage a revolution.
[00:43:12.864 --> 00:43:14.865]  Anytime he does something, it's the opposite.
[00:43:15.265 --> 00:43:17.826]  He tells you he doesn't introduce gun bills, that's all he does.
[00:43:17.826 --> 00:43:20.027]  He tells you he's not going to grab your property, that's all he does.
[00:43:20.027 --> 00:43:22.848]  He tells you there's no compulsory service, they try to pass the bills.
[00:43:22.848 --> 00:43:26.149]  He tells you he's not going to hire any lobbyists, that's all he does is hire lobbyists.
[00:43:26.149 --> 00:43:29.511]  He tells you everything he says is a lie.
[00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:31.071]  Paul Watson.
[00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.232]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[00:43:33.232 --> 00:43:34.153]  Hey bro.
[00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:39.575]  So break it down for us your excellent article, Obama claims CIA involvement in Iran patently false.
[00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:41.396]  Break it down.
[00:43:41.396 --> 00:43:42.356]  Well that's right.
[00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:44.917]  A few days ago Obama admitted to the fact that
[00:43:46.613 --> 00:43:57.196]  The 1953 overthrow of the democratically elected government of Mosaddegh in Iran was accomplished by means of the CIA.
[00:43:57.196 --> 00:44:00.957]  Now, that fact is documented historical fact.
[00:44:00.957 --> 00:44:03.397]  It's not disputed anymore.
[00:44:03.397 --> 00:44:13.640]  And yet, there are some neocons who like to hang out at the Free Republic site, which I came across when I was researching this again earlier today.
[00:44:14.557 --> 00:44:23.042]  Who still deny the fact that the CIA was even involved in the 1953 overthrow of Mosaddegh.
[00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:26.023]  So that's the level of denial going on.
[00:44:26.023 --> 00:44:34.828]  And then with this question about... Well that's because they hate, they hate radical Muslims so much they can't believe the radical Muslims are the sword of the New World Order.
[00:44:34.828 --> 00:44:38.630]  The sword of victory over all free societies.
[00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:43.793]  Right, and then with the question about is the CIA involved in the current unrest.
[00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:56.291]  One of the first links to pop up, if you research that in Google, is this Free Republic thread, where somebody posts an article asking, are the CIA involved?
[00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:59.871]  As we'll explain, it's not even debatable.
[00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:05.853]  But then the responses to it are, I don't care, I hope the CIA are involved.
[00:45:05.853 --> 00:45:08.133]  I certainly won't shed a tear if they are.
[00:45:08.133 --> 00:45:10.914]  Another one says, I certainly hope so.
[00:45:10.914 --> 00:45:11.794]  Of course they are.
[00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:18.180]  This is a horrible irony of it all.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:28.428]  Not that we support Ahmadinejad, and we've had to emphasize that over and over again, because some people have difficulty holding more than one thought in their head at one time.
[00:45:28.428 --> 00:45:40.116]  But these neocons are supporting Mousavi, who in the 80s, as you mentioned earlier, directed the terrorist campaign.
[00:45:41.517 --> 00:45:48.702]  And selected the terrorists to carry out the Beirut barracks bombing and others in the 1980s.
[00:45:48.702 --> 00:45:50.944]  They love him!
[00:45:50.944 --> 00:45:56.628]  This is the guy who oversaw the murder of hundreds of U.S.
[00:45:56.628 --> 00:45:58.490]  Marines.
[00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.330]  220 U.S.
[00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:04.434]  Marines died in the Beirut barracks bombing that was directed by Mousavi.
[00:46:04.434 --> 00:46:06.936]  And all these neocons are now supporting him.
[00:46:07.429 --> 00:46:14.751]  And saying that, good, the CIA should overthrow Ahmadinejad and put in the very regime that slaughtered hundreds of U.S.
[00:46:14.751 --> 00:46:18.952]  Marines in the 80s.
[00:46:18.952 --> 00:46:32.596]  So you have that going on, then you've got talking heads on establishment media, news networks, who have suddenly found this new concern for the mistreatment of protesters
[00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:39.032]  Which is obviously absent whenever it's anybody protesting against the war in Iraq.
[00:46:39.032 --> 00:46:40.093]  Well, here's an example.
[00:46:40.093 --> 00:46:45.694]  In China, all over the place, the police are caught dealing drugs, killing people, running mafia ops.
[00:46:45.694 --> 00:46:48.375]  Whole cities are falling to the Chinese people.
[00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:50.195]  The police are machine-gunning them.
[00:46:50.195 --> 00:46:57.537]  We have all the YouTube videos of them shooting people, attacking villagers, and none of our news will carry it, because they love China!
[00:46:57.537 --> 00:46:59.638]  They won't show a young girl bleeding to death there.
[00:46:59.638 --> 00:46:59.958]  In fact,
[00:47:00.928 --> 00:47:05.570]  Or they'll show them choking some woman, taking her to a mobile execution van, saying it's good!
[00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:12.072]  Or melting people's flesh down for cosmetics sold in finer cosmetics stores in the U.S.
[00:47:12.072 --> 00:47:12.772]  Exactly.
[00:47:12.772 --> 00:47:24.716]  They only show somebody dying in a tragic way when it aids them so they can blow entire skyscrapers up with giant 2,000 pound smart bombs, blowing women and children to little pieces.
[00:47:24.716 --> 00:47:26.537]  Then the neocons will say they love it!
[00:47:27.117 --> 00:47:29.958]  Oh, but right now they're so upset for her!
[00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:30.398]  Oh!
[00:47:30.398 --> 00:47:33.460]  I mean, again, ladies and gentlemen, it's a giant chess game.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.020]  They want to overthrow Iran.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.641]  They admit they were in there trying to start revolutions.
[00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:39.142]  They admit.
[00:47:39.142 --> 00:47:44.744]  They said that this guy, the opposition leader, lost.
[00:47:44.744 --> 00:47:49.606]  Well, first they were saying he won two hours before the polls closed.
[00:47:49.606 --> 00:47:51.947]  Then the government comes out and said, no, he lost.
[00:47:51.947 --> 00:47:53.568]  This is all a pure setup.
[00:47:55.546 --> 00:47:58.227]  And Alex, you've got former CIA heads on the news.
[00:47:58.227 --> 00:48:10.773]  There was one on Wolf Blitzer the other day, you know, saying that we should track all the mistreatment of the protesters because there's a brutal regime in place that tortures protesters and dissidents.
[00:48:10.773 --> 00:48:22.639]  A former CIA head, it was the CIA that trained CIVAC after the 1953 overthrow, trained them in torture techniques that they'd copied from the Nazis.
[00:48:23.191 --> 00:48:27.679]  But now the CIA is all concerned about how dissidents in Iran are treated.
[00:48:27.679 --> 00:48:33.629]  Now obviously we don't want anyone to be mistreated, but it just shows the rampant level of hypocrisy involved.
[00:48:34.947 --> 00:48:50.871]  Oh, it's totally insane, and now the stooge son of the Shaw keeps crying like Glenn Beck on TV with fake crying, saying he's so sad for this girl when his father murdered at least 300,000 people, ripping children's tongues out in front of their parents on record.
[00:48:50.871 --> 00:48:56.953]  The CIA's running around torturing everybody, but, oh, with no proof, oh, they might be torturing.
[00:48:56.953 --> 00:49:00.294]  This is the just disgust, and now blowing up the Marines is good.
[00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:05.360]  Yeah, the neocons now support a terrorist who killed hundreds of U.S.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:05.740]  Marines.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.442]  That's patriotic now, I guess.
[00:49:08.442 --> 00:49:25.075]  Now, the election itself, there was an independent American pollster, non-profit organization that went in there days before the election, and they published their results on June 15th in the Washington Post.
[00:49:25.075 --> 00:49:28.438]  They found, through their polls prior to the election,
[00:49:29.306 --> 00:49:34.029]  That Ahmadinejad was leading by more than a two-to-one margin.
[00:49:34.029 --> 00:49:41.054]  Because he was doing an anti-corruption campaign against the other group that is one of the most powerful factions.
[00:49:41.054 --> 00:49:46.638]  Ahmadinejad was actually popular with the people, weak with the elite.
[00:49:46.638 --> 00:49:47.198]  Exactly.
[00:49:47.198 --> 00:49:50.881]  It's the rich elite in Iran that support Mousavi.
[00:49:50.881 --> 00:49:58.286]  But they found that, and this is an Independent Emmy Award winning American polling company, this is not Iranian state TV.
[00:49:59.116 --> 00:50:04.320]  And they found that Ahmadinejad was going to win by a bigger margin than he actually did.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:10.605]  And in fact, his strongest voting bloc was people aged from 18 to 24.
[00:50:10.605 --> 00:50:26.657]  Now you've got some, the westernized youth and some of the university graduates that are supporting Mousavi for their own reasons, and then you've got direct, blatant CIA involvement which Obama denied, yet is admitted and on the record. 2007,
[00:50:29.466 --> 00:50:41.113]  ABC News, London Telegraph and others reported that President Bush had given the CIA approval to launch covert black operations to achieve regime change in Iran.
[00:50:41.113 --> 00:50:41.613]  Stay there.
[00:50:41.613 --> 00:50:42.774]  Yeah, it's on record.
[00:50:43.939 --> 00:50:51.065]  And they admitted four groups, three of them Sunni Wahhabis, with the number three in Al-Qaeda, launching attacks in Iran.
[00:50:51.065 --> 00:50:56.150]  Oh, our news didn't show those blown up school buses and mosque and dams.
[00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.213]  Oh no, they don't do that, they love Al-Qaeda!
[00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.759]  Recognize that sound?
[00:51:03.759 --> 00:51:08.541]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:10.981]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:51:10.981 --> 00:51:16.303]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:51:16.303 --> 00:51:21.704]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:25.145]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:51:25.145 --> 00:51:27.246]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:51:57.295 --> 00:52:02.200]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.566]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[00:52:19.458 --> 00:52:26.543]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.

[00:52:47.578 --> 00:52:48.319]  Reduce your payments.
[00:52:48.319 --> 00:52:48.980]  We're good.
[00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:02.866]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:53:02.866 --> 00:53:05.807]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:53:05.807 --> 00:53:08.048]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:53:08.048 --> 00:53:09.028]  Here's the story.
[00:53:09.028 --> 00:53:13.830]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.090]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:20.172]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:53:20.172 --> 00:53:22.013]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:53:22.273 --> 00:53:26.877]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:53:26.877 --> 00:53:32.401]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:34.603]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:53:34.603 --> 00:53:43.290]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:50.073]  I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran and is not interfering with Iran's affairs.
[00:54:11.021 --> 00:54:19.507]  But we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the Iranian people and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society.
[00:54:19.507 --> 00:54:23.849]  We deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.
[00:54:23.849 --> 00:54:30.334]  It's just so insulting, Paul Watson, from PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:59.168]  To have the CIA announce, really it was first in the news six years ago, after the forces were in Iraq, that they were destabilizing Iran, creating revolutionary groups in the students, while at the same time applying pressure on the government from Sunni Wahhabi groups.
[00:54:59.168 --> 00:55:05.951]  And then, two and a half years ago, they went ahead and the White House put a press release out and said, yeah, we're staging terror attacks over there.
[00:55:05.951 --> 00:55:11.033]  And then it's admitted they're bombing mosques with people in them, blowing them all up, blowing up Shiites.
[00:55:12.099 --> 00:55:17.063]  I mean, just outrageous crimes, and the public's so dumbed down, they can't find Iran on a map.
[00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:22.328]  I keep getting emails going, I want to kill you, Alex, you just love them camel riders, them Arabs.
[00:55:22.328 --> 00:55:24.410]  They're not Arabs, dummies.
[00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:29.314]  They're more closely to, you know, Pakistanis or Indians than they are Arabs.
[00:55:29.314 --> 00:55:29.895]  They're Persians.
[00:55:31.821 --> 00:55:35.122]  All I'm doing is saying it's a lie, the CIA admits they're there.
[00:55:35.122 --> 00:55:40.745]  But they're so arrogant that the CIA admits they're there doing it and then go on the news and say they're not.
[00:55:40.745 --> 00:55:43.006]  I mean, it's all about insulting you.
[00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:47.287]  Whether you want Iran to be nuked or not and hate them and want to kill every one of them.
[00:55:47.287 --> 00:55:50.209]  I mean, why just go along with the lie though?
[00:55:50.209 --> 00:55:52.790]  Because it's all part of just being a bunch of morons.
[00:55:53.510 --> 00:56:07.338]  And the fake conservatives, it just reminds me how disgusting they are, because I got them emailing me and stuff going, oh now you love the Iranians, and they'll even say that blew up our barracks while they're supporting the very guy that actually admittedly ran the operation.
[00:56:08.328 --> 00:56:10.669]  I mean, you people are... It's total 1984.
[00:56:10.669 --> 00:56:14.690]  It's more extreme, Paul, than 1984.
[00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:21.931]  The double-think, the crime-stop, the... And there's so many other points of how this is staged in the poll show.
[00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:25.752]  It was Ahmadinejad, and people don't know that this guy was really the insider.
[00:56:25.752 --> 00:56:32.054]  The Moussaoui... Please continue, Paul.
[00:56:32.054 --> 00:56:37.855]  Yeah, we were just talking about the fact that an American polling company went into Iran before the election.
[00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:50.099]  And according to their studies from an investigation conducted in Farsi, they found that Ahmadinejad was probably going to win by more than a 2-1 margin.
[00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:53.781]  He won, but with a less than 2-1 margin.
[00:56:53.781 --> 00:57:01.487]  Now before the polls had even closed, Mousavi was out in the media saying that he'd won.
[00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:09.669]  Not only before they finished counting the votes, but before the polling had even closed, because it ran over by a few hours, it ran late.
[00:57:09.669 --> 00:57:16.973]  So you've got Mousavi claiming he's already won, when all the previous polls would say he'd be easily defeated, he'd be trounced.
[00:57:16.973 --> 00:57:31.920]  And let's explain this, let's explain this, the ruling council of experts, they decide who can run, and international groups that look at elections say they're some of the fairest in the world, because it's rigged to begin with, they allow you to
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.322]  Well, Alex, not only the most ignorant neocons think that
[00:58:00.575 --> 00:58:01.895]  Iranians are Arabs.
[00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:12.739]  They think that Ahmadinejad is a dictator, when in fact he is selected, as you just said, by the ruling Guardian Council, as was Mousavi.
[00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:20.802]  They selected both candidates, so why would they need to rig an election in which they select both candidates in the first place?
[00:58:20.802 --> 00:58:26.464]  So you've got Mousavi saying he's going to win before the votes are even... before the polling's even closed.
[00:58:26.464 --> 00:58:27.104]  Then you've got
[00:58:27.901 --> 00:58:37.891]  These SMS messages, these text messages being sent to Iranians, also before the polls have closed, as well as Twitter accounts... Yeah, stay there.
[00:58:37.891 --> 00:58:42.876]  We're going to break the rest of it down, then get our other guest on in five minutes.

[00:59:53.385 --> 00:59:55.787]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.787 --> 01:00:05.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:06.536]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.317]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:10.079]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:11.640]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.601]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.601 --> 01:00:17.405]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:21.468]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.645 --> 01:00:25.067]  Paul Watson wrote another excellent article.
[01:00:25.067 --> 01:00:31.193]  Nada, the poster girl for a million more tragedies.
[01:00:31.193 --> 01:00:37.739]  They manipulate your emotions, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:37.739 --> 01:00:40.902]  This is really for the outside of Iran.
[01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:43.064]  It destabilizes, it hurts Iran.
[01:00:44.184 --> 01:00:47.527]  It allows the globalists to launch military strikes even if that doesn't happen.
[01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:51.110]  It discredits them worldwide because the public is dumbed down.
[01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.832]  They don't even know how the political system works over there.
[01:00:53.832 --> 01:00:55.834]  But the CIA is on record doing this.
[01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:58.916]  And yes, CIA commanded Twitter.
[01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:02.139]  The State Department on record admits they're doing it.
[01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:03.860]  With Twitter, giving Twitter orders.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.883]  That's in the New York Times!
[01:01:07.883 --> 01:01:11.947]  It's so sick to see these bankers manipulate this and get all these people killed.
[01:01:13.661 --> 01:01:19.305]  Knowing that when people attack police and start burning their police stations, they're going to shoot them.
[01:01:19.305 --> 01:01:25.430]  It's just, Paul, it's so disgu... And now the hero is the guy that blew up the barracks.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:27.992]  Just like now they tell us Qaddafi's a hero.
[01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:31.234]  No, I don't like this guy and I don't like Qaddafi either.
[01:01:31.234 --> 01:01:38.680]  And if you want to say, I'm Al Qaeda because I don't like Qaddafi and I don't like this Moussaoui guy, then that's fine.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.082]  I mean, that's how warped these people's minds are, Paul.
[01:01:42.509 --> 01:01:45.150]  That's right, they're supporting the guy who helped kill 220 U.S.
[01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.010]  Marines.
[01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.372]  It's Al-Qaeda launching the attacks over there!
[01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:49.912]  You know what?
[01:01:49.912 --> 01:01:51.372]  Recap everything, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:01:51.372 --> 01:01:53.573]  Tell folks about the article.
[01:01:53.573 --> 01:02:05.938]  Yeah, the neo-cons are supporting the terrorist Jundullah organization, which is being bankrolled as part of this CIA incursion into Iran, this destabilization campaign.
[01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:12.326]  They've bombed buses, they've bombed campaign headquarters, they've killed scores of people.
[01:02:12.326 --> 01:02:16.689]  They're working to destabilise the Iranian government on behalf of the CIA.
[01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:17.650]  This is all admitted.
[01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:25.496]  They're funding the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, which was once run by Saddam Hussein's intelligence services.
[01:02:25.496 --> 01:02:28.079]  That's now working for the CIA in Iran.
[01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:32.082]  There were members of that arrested in the riots last week.
[01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.524]  You've got the former Pakistani Army General
[01:02:35.256 --> 01:02:45.322]  With the document saying that the CIA distributed 400 million dollars inside Iran right before these riots to evoke the revolution.
[01:02:45.322 --> 01:02:52.047]  You've got the Twitter messages being sent out from accounts that were creators the day before.
[01:02:52.047 --> 01:02:58.811]  No Twitter alerts were sent out from any of those major accounts before these riots broke out.
[01:02:58.811 --> 01:02:59.932]  And it created the
[01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:18.361]  Myth that there had been vote fraud when in fact the independent polls run before by American polling companies clearly said that Ahmadinejad was going to win, but because Mousavi claimed that he was the winner, these messages went out to the Iranians before the polls had closed saying that Mousavi had won.
[01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:25.164]  So then when the official result was announced, there was this feeling of vote fraud which was manufactured completely out of thin air.
[01:03:25.164 --> 01:03:26.965]  There's no evidence for it.
[01:03:26.965 --> 01:03:30.306]  And yet the Anglo-American establishment media
[01:03:30.859 --> 01:03:34.544]  Keep citing it and they've provided no evidence whatsoever.
[01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:47.741]  Then you've got people like Kissinger the other day on BBC Newsnight saying that if the revolution isn't successful, then basically they're just going to go in and bomb the heck out of it anyway.
[01:03:48.345 --> 01:03:53.487]  So, how can that possibly benefit anyone in Iran, no matter who they support politically?
[01:03:53.487 --> 01:03:57.970]  Zbigniew admitted that they're, quote, manipulating things very smoothly.
[01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:01.051]  He's on CNN admitting they're doing it.
[01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:05.373]  I know, they got Obama lying to us with the other mouth, laughing at us, saying they're doing it.
[01:04:05.373 --> 01:04:07.574]  I mean, do the American people love being lied to?
[01:04:07.574 --> 01:04:10.376]  You're gonna have everything you've got taken too!
[01:04:10.376 --> 01:04:12.296]  They don't care about you either!
[01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:15.158]  They don't care about the Iranians, they don't care about you, Paul!
[01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:22.020]  And you've got John Bolton saying that they're going to create this revolution many months before.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:36.906]  You've got Kenneth Timmerman, who's affiliated with the National Endowment for Democracy, which is one of these NGOs that's funneled money into Iran, writing the day before the election, quote, there's talk of a green revolution in Tehran.
[01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:44.930]  And this is when Ahmadinejad predicted to win easily, and he's predicting a green revolution the day before it happens, before all this is set up.
[01:04:46.058 --> 01:04:50.503]  And he linked him with these NGOs that are funneling the money into Iran.
[01:04:50.503 --> 01:04:54.467]  And Watson, you didn't even have half the evidence with all my interruptions.
[01:04:54.467 --> 01:04:55.108]  God bless you.
[01:04:55.108 --> 01:04:57.330]  We'll see the rest of it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:57.751]  Great job.
[01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:06.576]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:05:06.576 --> 01:05:07.877]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:05:07.877 --> 01:05:12.140]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.002]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:05:14.002 --> 01:05:20.327]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:05:21.448 --> 01:05:24.331]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:05:24.331 --> 01:05:26.052]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:29.075]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:05:29.075 --> 01:05:30.776]  And their formula really works.
[01:05:30.776 --> 01:05:33.599]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:35.100]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:39.864]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:05:39.864 --> 01:05:42.286]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:05:42.286 --> 01:05:44.748]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:05:44.748 --> 01:05:46.850]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.431]  Go to www.
[01:05:49.853 --> 01:05:52.176]  We're good to go.
[01:06:00.816 --> 01:06:06.021]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:06.021 --> 01:06:10.045]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:10.045 --> 01:06:15.951]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.951 --> 01:06:21.036]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.036 --> 01:06:21.537]  Number three,
[01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:28.223]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:06:28.223 --> 01:06:31.126]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:06:31.126 --> 01:06:35.650]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:39.254]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:06:39.494 --> 01:06:45.216]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:49.918]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:51.698]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.698 --> 01:06:54.259]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:06:54.259 --> 01:06:56.900]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[01:07:01.172 --> 01:07:06.675]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:07:06.675 --> 01:07:07.475]  and the world.
[01:07:07.475 --> 01:07:11.337]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:07:11.337 --> 01:07:17.841]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:07:17.841 --> 01:07:19.862]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:07:19.862 --> 01:07:27.806]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:32.789]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:38.594]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:07:38.594 --> 01:07:40.775]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:43.017]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:07:43.237 --> 01:07:43.597]  Big Brother!
[01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:08.710]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.471]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.471 --> 01:08:12.051]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.051 --> 01:08:13.612]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:17.794]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:23.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.356 --> 01:08:30.820]  Hi, coming up at the bottom of the hour in T-minus 22 minutes,
[01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:41.207]  I'm going to get into Obama claims CIA involvement in Iran patently false, over some more of the evidence that just everything comes out of his mouth is a lie.
[01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:44.869]  Whether you're for overthrowing Iran or not, just can they stop all the lying?
[01:08:44.869 --> 01:08:46.711]  I'm just completely sick of it.
[01:08:46.711 --> 01:08:51.293]  Also, this Moussaoui celebrated in Iran protest was the butcher of Beirut.
[01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.234]  I just want to point that out that this guy's...
[01:08:54.355 --> 01:08:58.719]  As bad or worse than the people they're trying to overthrow, so I don't know where this is headed.
[01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:01.101]  Missing governor was in Argentina, we'll get into that.
[01:09:01.101 --> 01:09:09.209]  I will also get into how they're trying to pass the takeover of health care in the country and the new carbon taxes.
[01:09:09.209 --> 01:09:15.374]  So quite a bit, as big government makes its final move to make us more Soviet than Stalinist Russia.
[01:09:15.374 --> 01:09:18.717]  I mean, it's just totally vertically integrated society.
[01:09:18.717 --> 01:09:19.898]  And part of all of this
[01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:21.076]  Yes.
[01:09:31.172 --> 01:09:41.339]  You know, zoning and the National Association of Governors and County Commissioners and City Planners and the insurance companies say, you'll get a discount if you adopt these zoning laws.
[01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:43.601]  It's all just a sickening mass.
[01:09:43.601 --> 01:09:53.208]  And so it's happening all over the world, not just here, where here in Austin they put $2,000 a day fines on old people's yards that have three-inch grass and then they come and
[01:09:54.147 --> 01:09:56.409]  Two weeks, it's $14,000, take it.
[01:09:56.409 --> 01:10:08.761]  I've seen articles in Denver where Christian groups may have seven people over for a Bible study on Saturday night, and they come and ticket everybody's cars and ticket the house, and they can have a strip club party next door.
[01:10:08.761 --> 01:10:14.286]  In one case, they were having rowdy parties next door, but that was okay with the strippers dancing on the tables.
[01:10:14.286 --> 01:10:15.567]  Just don't have a Bible study.
[01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:19.111]  They've kicked rabbis' meetings out of their own houses.
[01:10:20.538 --> 01:10:27.062]  They're saying rabbis can't have circumcisions at their houses or at other people's houses.
[01:10:27.062 --> 01:10:29.863]  They can't have Passover at their houses.
[01:10:29.863 --> 01:10:31.284]  Nothing.
[01:10:31.284 --> 01:10:34.806]  They're telling Muslims they can't have meetings at their houses.
[01:10:34.806 --> 01:10:38.108]  And they selectively persecute religious groups, especially Christians.
[01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:43.851]  Just like CPS, we've had the lawyers on, it's been in the news, target homeschooling families of Christians.
[01:10:43.851 --> 01:10:46.593]  They don't like people that aren't in the government training centers.
[01:10:47.293 --> 01:10:49.455]  And you remember this case a month ago in San Diego.
[01:10:49.455 --> 01:10:50.856]  It wasn't even a law.
[01:10:50.856 --> 01:10:53.859]  They were just misapplying, because I read the code.
[01:10:53.859 --> 01:10:58.383]  And that's why we've got Pastor Dave Jones.
[01:10:58.383 --> 01:11:00.405]  Hey, that's my daddy's name.
[01:11:00.405 --> 01:11:07.292]  We've got Pastor Dave Jones on, and then we've got his lawyer, Dean Broyles, on the program with us.
[01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:09.474]  And they stood up and said no, but the issue is
[01:11:10.114 --> 01:11:11.636]  You think this zoning's bad now?
[01:11:11.636 --> 01:11:17.161]  Wait with the Obama Green Brigades and the home inspections they're passing that the Feds won't pass.
[01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:18.342]  Austin just passed it.
[01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:24.068]  Where these little Soviets come in your house and do these audits of your carbon footprint.
[01:11:24.068 --> 01:11:25.790]  The harassment has only begun.
[01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:33.678]  So we've got to realize this is standardized zoning is being used to tyrannize everybody and the bedrock of the First Amendment.
[01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:36.236]  Is that you can do anything you want in your house.
[01:11:36.236 --> 01:11:38.337]  Even the Magna Carta 1215.
[01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:40.839]  A man's home is his castle.
[01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:45.061]  Even the King of England, without a warrant, couldn't come in your house.
[01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:49.604]  But I've seen cases in Illinois where people wake up with police standing over them.
[01:11:49.604 --> 01:11:54.907]  They do unannounced home inspection saying under zoning laws they don't need a warrant.
[01:11:54.907 --> 01:11:57.148]  And you wake up and above your bed.
[01:11:57.148 --> 01:11:59.089]  This was in the Chicago newspapers.
[01:11:59.089 --> 01:12:01.471]  And some of the surrounding suburbs do this.
[01:12:02.091 --> 01:12:12.583]  And then if you have more than two toothbrushes, let's say your house is zoned for two people to be in it, and there's more than two toothbrushes, not even three people, they then find you in your bed.
[01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:13.324]  I'm not kidding.
[01:12:13.324 --> 01:12:14.545]  I know you can't believe it.
[01:12:14.545 --> 01:12:16.227]  It was in local newspapers years ago.
[01:12:17.048 --> 01:12:18.188]  This stuff is so insane.
[01:12:18.188 --> 01:12:23.890]  And now under this new bill to federalize all water, including puddles, they say no warrant.
[01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:25.191]  They're coming on your land.
[01:12:25.191 --> 01:12:27.192]  Remember the wetlands project?
[01:12:27.192 --> 01:12:28.192]  So I'm going to shut up now.
[01:12:28.192 --> 01:12:30.673]  I just want to give you some background.
[01:12:30.673 --> 01:12:36.675]  Pastor Dave Jones presides over a flock in San Diego, California.
[01:12:36.675 --> 01:12:42.357]  He was recently harassed for having a prayer group at his home and his lawyer, Dean Broyles.
[01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:45.178]  Men, thanks for coming on and thanks for standing up for the First Amendment.
[01:12:45.956 --> 01:12:47.638]  Thanks for having us, Alex.
[01:12:47.638 --> 01:12:48.819]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[01:12:48.819 --> 01:12:51.000]  This is Dean Broyles.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.262]  Hey, Dean, and hey, Pastor Dave.
[01:12:53.262 --> 01:12:55.905]  Okay, you guys got the floor for the next 20 minutes.
[01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:58.387]  Tell us what happened, what this was like.
[01:12:58.387 --> 01:13:00.709]  Well, let me do it in a brief way, I guess.
[01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:13.560]  First of all, on April 10th of this year, a code enforcement officer came to our house and asked us if we had a Bible study.
[01:13:14.916 --> 01:13:17.458]  And we said, of course, yes, we do.
[01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.679]  My wife did.
[01:13:18.679 --> 01:13:28.307]  And then they told us that was not permitted use according to the code and it was a violation of a religious assembly code.
[01:13:28.307 --> 01:13:29.008]  And so that was 2100 to 2106.
[01:13:29.008 --> 01:13:30.309]  That's where you find that code section.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:41.484]  My wife thought they were just misunderstood, you know, that we had just a simple Bible study with 15 people.
[01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:48.768]  And so she explained we had dinner and then a Bible study and prayer and then had dessert.
[01:13:48.768 --> 01:13:52.149]  And the lady asked her, well, do you say amen?
[01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:54.070]  Do you say praise the Lord?
[01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:56.031]  Do you sing?
[01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.672]  And my wife was so shocked.
[01:13:57.672 --> 01:13:59.773]  She's not sure how she actually answered that.
[01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:02.775]  It was kind of like, you know, what does that have to do with it?
[01:14:03.784 --> 01:14:09.427]  And then she was very clear and adamant that we had two weeks to comply.
[01:14:09.427 --> 01:14:21.394]  If we did not, that there would be a $100 fine for the first violation, $200 for the second, $500 for the third, $1,000 for the fourth, and then that they would take us to court.
[01:14:21.394 --> 01:14:22.535]  This was our warning.
[01:14:22.535 --> 01:14:23.976]  You would not get anything else.
[01:14:23.976 --> 01:14:27.618]  My wife said, please send something in writing.
[01:14:28.258 --> 01:14:40.902]  And so we received that a week later, and the citation of course is posted on the Western Center for Law and Policy, and you can see that on their website.
[01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:49.105]  It was a ticket for a citation for a religious assembly, and that we would cease and stop religious assembly.
[01:14:49.105 --> 01:14:51.805]  And by the way, it was interesting as I listened to what you said, Alex, 7703,
[01:14:54.086 --> 01:15:00.768]  Uh, is another section and that's the two sections they quoted and the paper that accompanied the citation.
[01:15:00.768 --> 01:15:08.750]  And I just want to read what it says to you because it says, any deputized, anyone specific individual deputized by the director.
[01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:12.991]  And by the way, this is the, again, the paperwork that accompanied the citation.
[01:15:12.991 --> 01:15:19.533]  It says may arrest a person without warrant whenever the director, uh, or the, uh,
[01:15:20.131 --> 01:15:28.056]  Authorized deputy has reasonable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed an infraction or misdemeanor in the presence of the violation of the government order.
[01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:38.143]  Yeah, they've turned themselves into a new law enforcement agency just stomping around declaring themselves with imperial god-like powers to violate free assembly.
[01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:44.167]  You're allowed to have 15 people over for dinner and pray and you're allowed to beat on drums if you want and howl at the moon.
[01:15:44.167 --> 01:15:45.167]  I mean, this is America!
[01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:46.028]  Right.
[01:15:47.048 --> 01:15:48.810]  Well, so that's what they said.
[01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:52.954]  That's the accompanying pages of the citation.
[01:15:52.954 --> 01:15:54.516]  It was never over a parking.
[01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.758]  They never said this is a parking problem.
[01:15:56.758 --> 01:15:58.960]  You know, I... Yeah, basically, we're God.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.264]  We're gonna arrest you if you don't stop doing this.
[01:16:02.264 --> 01:16:04.326]  Well, they definitely said they were gonna fine us.
[01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:07.149]  They didn't verbalize that, but they said it in writing that they could.
[01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:10.723]  Unbelievable.
[01:16:10.723 --> 01:16:18.186]  Now, your lawyer, and I've read these sections myself, this is clearly misapplied and they don't have this authority, correct?
[01:16:18.186 --> 01:16:19.066]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:19.066 --> 01:16:21.747]  We sent them a detailed demand letter.
[01:16:21.747 --> 01:16:23.928]  It was about 11, 12 pages long.
[01:16:23.928 --> 01:16:25.808]  And we made three arguments.
[01:16:25.808 --> 01:16:27.789]  The first was a common sense argument.
[01:16:27.789 --> 01:16:30.130]  The second, third, and fourth were legal arguments.
[01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:37.252]  But our first statement was the clear understanding of both what the ordinance said
[01:16:38.221 --> 01:16:41.503]  And what a common sense view of churches.
[01:16:41.503 --> 01:16:46.986]  We told them this is clearly not a religious assembly as defined by the county ordinances.
[01:16:46.986 --> 01:16:54.751]  And so therefore, the requirement of a major use permit, which costs tens of thousands of dollars, is not applicable.
[01:16:54.751 --> 01:17:02.656]  And pursuant to their own definitions, they define religious assemblies as bigger gatherings like churches and synagogues, etc.
[01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:17.711]  They were clearly interpreting their own laws and ordinances in a very sweeping and over-broad manner, and applying it to the pastor's small home group Bible study in a completely inappropriate way.
[01:17:17.711 --> 01:17:24.953]  Secondly, we pointed out that their interpretation was violating our client's rights to freely exercise their religion.
[01:17:24.953 --> 01:17:30.175]  Thirdly, we brought a peaceable assembly, and there's other elements of the First Amendment which we could have argued also.
[01:17:30.854 --> 01:17:45.506]  And then, fourthly, we said that the Joneses were protected by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, which is a law that Congress passed several years ago that protects religious individuals in regard to land use.
[01:17:45.506 --> 01:17:58.077]  So, they were clearly out of line, and as soon as they got their letter, the next morning they begged to have a meeting with us, and we met with them the next day, and within the next week, the matter was resolved.
[01:17:58.077 --> 01:17:59.138]  They apologized.
[01:17:59.639 --> 01:18:09.925]  They promised to train their people better and have better use of the people, better review of the people who are going out writing and applying these kind of tickets and citations.
[01:18:09.925 --> 01:18:18.650]  So it looks like at this point that the county is in full retreat and is apologizing and is going to correct their ordinances and make it right.
[01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:22.292]  We're going to stay on top of them to make sure that that actually occurs.
[01:18:22.292 --> 01:18:24.374]  Sure, but the moral of the story is, and I'm sure
[01:18:26.363 --> 01:18:47.689]  Mr. Broyles, because you're a lawyer that fights this stuff, you know this is going on all over the country, that it's important for people to stand up and say no, because a lot of people are laying down to this, and then this abuse of power, this color of law, fraud by these little commissars is expanding as they flaunt this illegitimate authority everywhere.
[01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:52.630]  That's absolutely right, and that's one issue we've faced over the last several years is
[01:18:53.889 --> 01:19:07.795]  Often it's hard to even talk the potential clients into facing down the government, and if we don't do that, we're going to end up being in a situation that they're facing in Iran right now, where the government is just running roughshod over the rights of the people.
[01:19:07.795 --> 01:19:21.080]  And so, it's very important that individuals are willing to take a stand and say, no, these are my God-given rights, these are my constitutional rights, and I'm willing to stand on them to protect others.
[01:19:22.452 --> 01:19:23.192]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:27.554]  Look at how they put us in free speech zones, and now we're even trying to phase those out.
[01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:30.035]  This is how liberty dies in little steps.
[01:19:30.035 --> 01:19:32.676]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:32.676 --> 01:19:40.199]  Well, Alex, I wanted to say something that has been something we've battled since this came, since it went on the news.
[01:19:40.199 --> 01:19:42.920]  What it is, is they claimed it was a parking
[01:19:44.016 --> 01:19:50.719]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:20:13.436 --> 01:20:19.402]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:20:19.402 --> 01:20:22.886]  Starve or surrender.
[01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:27.771]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:20:27.771 --> 01:20:28.852]  What then?
[01:20:30.623 --> 01:20:33.706]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.

[01:20:38.009 --> 01:20:40.972]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[01:21:01.198 --> 01:21:02.619]  It is a big idea.
[01:21:02.619 --> 01:21:05.440]  A New World Order.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.021]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:13.143]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:13.143 --> 01:21:15.944]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:21:15.944 --> 01:21:19.125]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:26.428]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:34.912]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:34.912 --> 01:21:38.774]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:38.774 --> 01:21:41.356]  The Old Barrier is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:41.356 --> 01:21:42.517]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:42.517 --> 01:21:43.297]  They're not after money.
[01:21:43.297 --> 01:21:44.578]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:44.578 --> 01:21:45.559]  They're after power.
[01:21:45.559 --> 01:21:46.700]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:21:55.425 --> 01:21:56.186]  Endgame.
[01:21:56.186 --> 01:21:58.227]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:21:58.227 --> 01:21:59.328]  You have been warned.
[01:22:00.328 --> 01:22:00.929]  Good day.
[01:22:00.929 --> 01:22:02.710]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:03.110]  June 24th, 2009.
[01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:04.230]  Gold opened this morning at $9.2890.
[01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:07.512]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.5564, $4.7782 for a half ounce, $2.3891 for a quarter ounce.
[01:22:07.512 --> 01:22:07.992]  That's $9.5564, $4.7782, or $2.3891.
[01:22:20.158 --> 01:22:33.785]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:33.785 --> 01:22:35.026]  Is this capitalism?
[01:22:35.026 --> 01:22:42.609]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:43.710]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:47.852]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:48.052 --> 01:22:49.313]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.313 --> 01:22:53.975]  Isn't it time to understand the system?

[01:23:00.478 --> 01:23:05.821]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[01:23:05.821 --> 01:23:09.843]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[01:23:10.296 --> 01:23:14.720]  Now you don't have to drink even a single drop thanks to NuRev.

[01:24:02.064 --> 01:24:07.886]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:07.886 --> 01:24:10.507]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:10.567]  WCL
[01:24:18.251 --> 01:24:27.853]  D-L-A-W dot O-R-G is the group that I always see constantly fighting the state when trying to stomp over people's constitutional rights.
[01:24:27.853 --> 01:24:33.495]  And that's who Dean Broyles is with, a lawyer.
[01:24:33.495 --> 01:24:36.255]  Tell us about your organization, Dean, and the types of things you see.
[01:24:36.255 --> 01:24:42.637]  And we'll go back to Pastor Dave Jones and that one point he was making about the police officer.
[01:24:42.637 --> 01:24:47.818]  Well, we at the Western Center for Law and Policy generally fight for faith, family, and freedom.
[01:24:49.442 --> 01:24:54.987]  We're a First Amendment law firm, and we do civil litigation and some policy work in this area.
[01:24:54.987 --> 01:25:04.235]  And we've been in existence for two and a half years, although I've been doing this kind of work pro bono on behalf of Christians everywhere for the last 14 years.
[01:25:04.235 --> 01:25:13.563]  So we're based here on the West Coast, but we're getting cases all over the United States at this point.
[01:25:13.563 --> 01:25:14.965]  And you see a lot of this, don't you?
[01:25:15.962 --> 01:25:16.823]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:16.823 --> 01:25:27.389]  We see this happening every day, and thank God that there's an army of Christian attorneys and conservative attorneys out there to fight these types of cases.
[01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:32.613]  There's several thousand attorneys that have been trained all over the United States to fight these types of cases.
[01:25:32.613 --> 01:25:37.476]  And I've never seen you lose, because I see these reports all the time, when people fight.
[01:25:37.476 --> 01:25:39.937]  But as you said, most people just roll over.
[01:25:41.738 --> 01:25:44.359]  I mean, this is totally un-American, incredibly unpopular.
[01:25:44.359 --> 01:25:45.699]  It's wrong.
[01:25:45.699 --> 01:25:49.860]  Pastor Dave Jones, go back to the police officer story.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:58.343]  Well, after this had occurred, a police officer that I was acquainted with saw me and he just congratulated us on our victory and for our stand in that.
[01:25:58.343 --> 01:26:05.545]  And then he said, he asked me if I thought this was an intrusion upon our rights or religious freedom.
[01:26:05.545 --> 01:26:08.106]  And I said, well, of course it was, absolutely.
[01:26:08.106 --> 01:26:11.427]  And then he explained to me that as a police officer, when they get these calls,
[01:26:11.912 --> 01:26:13.313]  They normally go through dispatch.
[01:26:13.313 --> 01:26:16.755]  It would not have even made it through dispatch in this case.
[01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:19.297]  It was weeks prior.
[01:26:19.297 --> 01:26:21.838]  And, by the way, the complaint wasn't from a neighbor.
[01:26:21.838 --> 01:26:23.419]  We only have two neighbors.
[01:26:23.419 --> 01:26:28.082]  We have 268 feet of private driveway to three homes.
[01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:33.346]  And we paid for the paving and maintenance of that road.
[01:26:33.346 --> 01:26:38.529]  And then at the end of 268 feet, we have over two acres of property ourselves.
[01:26:39.062 --> 01:27:02.562]  We park all of our cars on our property and every now and then somebody is parked in that private driveway area, but the point is that when he told me that, you know, this shouldn't have even gotten out of dispatch, but somebody else got a hold of this thing and he said, we have gone out on parking, you know, citation complaints.
[01:27:03.309 --> 01:27:07.770]  And you just tell the person to re-park and everything's fine, no ticket is given.
[01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:15.411]  This was weeks later that they showed up and the only purpose they showed up was to cite us for a religious assembly.
[01:27:15.411 --> 01:27:23.232]  It was never discussed in six conversations that we had with them as we tried to reason with them that this was just a Bible study.
[01:27:23.232 --> 01:27:24.953]  They never brought up parking.
[01:27:24.953 --> 01:27:31.774]  They only told us we were wrong with the code and we had to stop in our Bible study.
[01:27:32.065 --> 01:27:42.786]  Let me ask Dean Broyles a question because again I just see this in the newspaper here and there every week or so and have experienced it myself here in Austin with my grandparents with some brush in a creek behind their house that wasn't even their property.
[01:27:44.235 --> 01:27:52.698]  Dealing with these zoning boards, we see a trend here where they love persecuting Christians and conservatives, that it's a relish.
[01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:59.520]  I mean, what type of individuals are these, from your experience, that really are that anti-American?
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:07.903]  Because even if I disagreed with somebody and hated them, I mean, if they were doing, you know, some kind of weird, animus thing in their backyard, that's their right to do it.
[01:28:07.903 --> 01:28:08.983]  Why do they hate Christians?
[01:28:10.708 --> 01:28:15.149]  Well, you know, that's a very good question, and that's a question we've been asking ourselves in this case.
[01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:30.334]  Is this, you know, is this a rogue, you know, zoning person just out to get Christians, or is it a departmental issue that there's kind of, you know, across the board animus against Christians?
[01:28:30.334 --> 01:28:32.375]  And it's really hard to tell.
[01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:39.777]  I mean, certainly at the end of the day, the county did the right thing, and the Chief Administrative Officer apologized and backed down and has promised to
[01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:44.332]  You know, investigate this properly, but sometimes it's hard to know.
[01:28:44.332 --> 01:29:09.803]  I mean, generally across the United States and the media and other places, we see a hostility towards Christianity in general, and we see a hostility towards the name of Jesus in particular, and so that definitely is kind of culture-wide on a lot of fronts, and we suspect that that may be at issue here, but it's really hard to pin down as far as what the motivations of the individuals were in this case.
[01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:20.752]  Well, they would never think of harassing some other religious group unless it's mainline big three religions, and it seems like those are open season.
[01:29:20.752 --> 01:29:22.373]  Just absolutely amazing.
[01:29:22.373 --> 01:29:27.075]  Well, I'm glad that this case has been concluded.
[01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:30.877]  Are you guys thinking about any litigation or this is dropped?
[01:29:30.877 --> 01:29:36.080]  No, at this point, if the county follows through on the very strong commitments that they've made,
[01:29:36.927 --> 01:29:48.192]  Um, certainly litigation will not be required and that's one of the amazing things about this case is because of the media outrage and the amount of individuals who are emailing and writing and calling the county.
[01:29:48.192 --> 01:29:48.913]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:29:48.913 --> 01:29:51.294]  We got a break.
[01:29:51.294 --> 01:29:54.295]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.295 --> 01:29:57.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.623 --> 01:30:02.005]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:04.007]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:30:04.007 --> 01:30:04.988]  Well, you should.
[01:30:04.988 --> 01:30:09.473]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:30:09.473 --> 01:30:10.294]  That's right.
[01:30:10.294 --> 01:30:20.305]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:20.305 --> 01:30:21.467]  Plus, if you act fast,
[01:30:21.647 --> 01:30:27.631]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:34.535]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:30:34.535 --> 01:30:40.059]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:30:40.059 --> 01:30:41.520]  This is real.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.580]  Don't miss out.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:49.425]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:49.665 --> 01:30:51.126]  And get your free handgun.

[01:31:00.993 --> 01:31:01.633]  Hello, friends.
[01:31:01.633 --> 01:31:02.694]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.694 --> 01:31:05.656]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[01:31:05.656 --> 01:31:07.437]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[01:31:07.437 --> 01:31:08.638]  We need to be independent.
[01:31:08.638 --> 01:31:10.400]  And food and water is the key.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.382]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:31:13.382 --> 01:31:17.264]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:31:17.264 --> 01:31:18.165]  In any emergency,
[01:31:18.385 --> 01:31:19.507]  If you simply prepare.
[01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:22.751]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:31:22.751 --> 01:31:29.761]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:31:29.761 --> 01:31:33.045]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:31:33.045 --> 01:31:33.286]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:35.609 --> 01:31:36.109]  We're good to go!
[01:32:05.475 --> 01:32:05.916]  I think so.
[01:32:21.024 --> 01:32:21.264]  I think so.
[01:32:49.853 --> 01:32:52.574]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:32:52.574 --> 01:32:53.334]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:53.875]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:21.445 --> 01:33:30.691]  Free speech zones, all this zoning, this new federal bill that all water will now be federal, wells, rainwater, everything.
[01:33:30.691 --> 01:33:35.515]  It's just, it's called tyranny.
[01:33:35.515 --> 01:33:42.019]  And they certainly use zoning as one of the most abusive forms of corruption out there.
[01:33:42.019 --> 01:33:49.865]  Alright, finishing up with Pastor Dave Jones, who presided over a flock of 15 people outside San Diego.
[01:33:51.107 --> 01:33:52.969]  His own property, his own parking.
[01:33:52.969 --> 01:33:54.790]  Can't do that in America.
[01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:58.173]  But they stood up and said no, and the establishment backed off.
[01:33:58.173 --> 01:34:04.279]  I guess the big issue here is, for both of you in closing, and the closing comments from you both, is
[01:34:07.066 --> 01:34:09.288]  You said you had a bunch of conversations with the zoning department.
[01:34:09.288 --> 01:34:11.669]  Sounds like at first they weren't backing down.
[01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:13.450]  They were going to go along with this.
[01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:15.731]  The higher-ups were backing this.
[01:34:15.731 --> 01:34:21.013]  Yes, you're not allowed to have 15 people over for dinner in America because we're the bureaucrats.
[01:34:21.013 --> 01:34:21.774]  We're your gods.
[01:34:21.774 --> 01:34:31.478]  You're just here to pay taxes and shut up and drink your fluoride water and take your vaccines and provide children for us and for the CPS to adopt out.
[01:34:31.478 --> 01:34:32.359]  I mean, basically,
[01:34:34.421 --> 01:34:37.003]  Did they back off immediately, or how fast did they back off?
[01:34:37.003 --> 01:34:47.991]  Because that's your answer, whether or not this was a rogue minion, or whether this was higher-ups, because I know it's the higher-ups, because I see this all over the country over and over again.
[01:34:47.991 --> 01:34:51.074]  You're exactly right, and this is Dave Jones.
[01:34:51.074 --> 01:34:53.816]  I wanted to say that, because it wasn't a rogue.
[01:34:53.816 --> 01:34:55.737]  We had six conversations with them.
[01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:59.560]  We appealed to them, first when the code enforcement officer came.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:02.842]  Secondly, when we got the permit, we started our citation.
[01:35:04.013 --> 01:35:07.536]  We started to call them, three phone calls.
[01:35:07.536 --> 01:35:23.750]  We talked to the planning, land use department, and then the zoning department, and every conversation we had with them, we were told that we were wrong, and that we were not in compliance, and that we had to stop the Bible study.
[01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:26.652]  This was, again, it was never a parking issue.
[01:35:26.652 --> 01:35:29.615]  It went on for five weeks before
[01:35:30.615 --> 01:35:47.272]  The attorney, uh, Broyles and that, when we met together, there were nine people in a room at the county's office, and they were once again positioning themselves that it was an issue with religious assembly, never brought up that it was parking.
[01:35:47.272 --> 01:35:49.374]  They're just, you know, they're just hiding behind that.
[01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:53.318]  But then their bluff didn't work, did it, Mr. Broyles?
[01:35:54.437 --> 01:36:02.084]  No, absolutely, and you were asking about lawsuits or winning it another way, and this was one in the court of public opinion.
[01:36:02.084 --> 01:36:08.751]  The outrage and anger that was expressed at the county once this went viral on the internet and once the media got involved.
[01:36:08.751 --> 01:36:12.754]  I mean, across the board we got positive coverage in the media.
[01:36:12.754 --> 01:36:19.661]  And the pressure that was exerted on the county once they read our demand letter, once they met with us and knew we were serious.
[01:36:20.276 --> 01:36:38.660]  They began to back off and then within a week... But I want to understand from you, so they backed off and apologize, I want to know from you though, sir, because you're around these snakes more than I am, how do they get so whacked out of their mind on a power trip that they think in America you can't have people over for dinner?
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.101]  I mean, what has happened to this country?
[01:36:41.101 --> 01:36:44.381]  Why are most of the counties I know behaving just like this?
[01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:46.122]  What is their malfunction?
[01:36:46.122 --> 01:36:47.402]  Where do these people come from?
[01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:50.292]  I think it's a combination of things.
[01:36:50.292 --> 01:37:00.721]  I think, for one part, these bureaucrats, they look at their own laws and their own regulations, and to them, those laws become above the Constitution of the United States.
[01:37:00.721 --> 01:37:12.712]  They start seeing those laws and ordinances as God, in a sense, and they worship those gods, and they apply those gods in a way that, in their mind, is not inconsistent with their worldview.
[01:37:13.399 --> 01:37:22.044]  And they start overruling, in a sense, the first principle, the first amendment to the United States Constitution, which obviously the rest of us see as more important.
[01:37:22.044 --> 01:37:24.986]  That's one thing that starts happening with these bureaucrats.
[01:37:24.986 --> 01:37:31.930]  The other thing that's happening, I think, is that there's a very anti-Christian bias being expressed in our society today.
[01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:38.554]  And so that helps make it more palatable in their own minds to apply their laws in a very
[01:37:39.838 --> 01:37:45.685]  Unethical and in an almost illegal manner to violate fundamental First Amendment rights.
[01:37:45.685 --> 01:37:55.156]  Well this is one step away from Rome or Communist China because in Communist China you can have a church that's just official state approved and with a 501c3 and with
[01:37:57.779 --> 01:37:59.020]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.641]  One of the things that was ironic about this case
[01:38:24.489 --> 01:38:38.823]  Is that one of the, we were interviewed by CNN, Fox News, everybody gave the story great coverage, but one of the most interesting interviews we did was with Voice of America, which ironically broadcasts into Communist China.
[01:38:38.823 --> 01:38:48.612]  And Pastor Jones and I talked several times about the irony of that, that Communist China, where now, actually Christianity has grown through the house church movement.
[01:38:49.518 --> 01:38:56.023]  Here in the United States, that's starting to be shut down, potentially, and so the irony there was pretty stunning.
[01:38:56.023 --> 01:39:00.406]  Well, I'm not going to start preaching at people, but there's nothing more Christian than having it in your house.
[01:39:00.406 --> 01:39:04.029]  That's the way it's supposed to be, and the establishment doesn't like it.
[01:39:04.029 --> 01:39:11.515]  I think a lot of the big churches don't like it as well, and they're kind of getting in bed with the government, and it's just incredibly dangerous.
[01:39:11.515 --> 01:39:15.798]  Anything else, Pastor Dave Jones, or your lawyer, Dean Broyles, that you'd like to add?
[01:39:16.893 --> 01:39:30.036]  I'd just like to say I appreciate some of your comments that you've made and it was a shock to us that somebody would have a mindset that they could tell us what to do behind our closed doors.
[01:39:30.586 --> 01:39:45.676]  We appealed to them on that, and we were just blown away with the thought that they could sit in their chair or go to their house and think they could do what they wanted to, but they could tell me I couldn't have 15 people over to, you know, read the Bible and pray.
[01:39:45.676 --> 01:39:48.618]  It still is a shock to us, and that's the truth.
[01:39:48.618 --> 01:39:57.244]  That's the true story here, and it wasn't parking, and the public needs to know that, that they are going to continue this line.
[01:39:57.244 --> 01:39:58.765]  I'm sure of it, because what they learned
[01:39:59.207 --> 01:40:06.252]  Is that they can go to the public and just say it's a parking issue, and we watch it defuse the public.
[01:40:06.252 --> 01:40:09.894]  They're still talking to me, saying, well, Pastor Dave, of course you have to park right.
[01:40:09.894 --> 01:40:10.935]  That was never the issue.
[01:40:12.438 --> 01:40:13.058]  No, I understand.
[01:40:13.058 --> 01:40:19.680]  They always distract things off what they've really done and still try to make you the victim and never even own up.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.322]  I mean, if they're going to carry out this tyranny, they should debate it from that point.
[01:40:23.322 --> 01:40:25.422]  It's just, it's so deceptive.
[01:40:25.422 --> 01:40:27.823]  It's just, they are very wicked.
[01:40:27.823 --> 01:40:28.383]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:28.383 --> 01:40:29.484]  Absolutely.
[01:40:29.484 --> 01:40:35.226]  I would just add that, you know, a lot of people really still cannot believe that this story actually happened.
[01:40:35.226 --> 01:40:36.626]  And we've been telling everybody it's true.
[01:40:36.626 --> 01:40:37.126]  It's true.
[01:40:37.126 --> 01:40:41.648]  So if you want to verify what happens, please visit our website, wclplaw.org.
[01:40:42.569 --> 01:40:55.136]  All the important documents, all the important documents are on there, including the citation, our demand letter to the county, their response and apology, and it's all true, and as Pastor said, it had nothing to do with traffic or parking.
[01:40:55.136 --> 01:41:06.863]  Alright, gentlemen, well, we just hope that other people listening around the country understand, or people listening to this later as it's archived on the internet, understand that you need to stand up to these people and stop
[01:41:07.737 --> 01:41:17.305]  Being basically domesticated to live in a cross between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia with a little bit of Fidel's Cuba mixed in.
[01:41:17.305 --> 01:41:20.568]  I mean, this is just mind control.
[01:41:20.568 --> 01:41:22.009]  It's thought crime.
[01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:23.691]  It's discrimination.
[01:41:23.691 --> 01:41:28.194]  And we commend you, Mr. Broyles, and you, Pastor Jones.
[01:41:28.194 --> 01:41:31.277]  And if anything develops in this, we'll talk again.
[01:41:31.277 --> 01:41:33.419]  And Dean, I know you're busy, but any time.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:41.244]  I know you work on a lot of other cases that don't seem to hit the zeitgeist and get this attention, and some cases that are even more egregious.
[01:41:41.244 --> 01:41:45.266]  So you've got our email and our contact info, hopefully.
[01:41:45.266 --> 01:41:58.754]  So please give us a heads up on some of the other cases where they've got these families cornered with these jackals and hyenas using their trumped-up, phony, bureaucratic lingo to violate the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:41:58.754 --> 01:42:01.716]  So we'll talk to you again as this unfolds further.
[01:42:01.716 --> 01:42:01.996]  Thank you.
[01:42:03.752 --> 01:42:05.293]  All right, gentlemen, take care.
[01:42:05.293 --> 01:42:09.054]  I meant to just have them on about 15 minutes, but you just keep wanting to get into the detail.
[01:42:09.054 --> 01:42:14.856]  Because it's not just that they're violating your rights, telling you what you can do in your house.
[01:42:14.856 --> 01:42:21.219]  It's that then they lie about what they did later and never face up to the scum they are.
[01:42:21.219 --> 01:42:25.380]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to tell you again.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:31.163]  I can't help people with their CPS cases anymore because I mentally can't help it.
[01:42:31.163 --> 01:42:31.723]  I can't handle it.
[01:42:33.035 --> 01:42:34.335]  I try to help them on air sometimes.
[01:42:34.335 --> 01:42:36.736]  I try to give people tips on air.
[01:42:36.736 --> 01:42:43.059]  But I can't go to the court cases and watch the judges laughing and the pedophiles getting off on grabbing the kids.
[01:42:43.059 --> 01:42:44.899]  I mean, it's just pure court of evil.
[01:42:44.899 --> 01:42:48.401]  I mean, you're watching something out of hell go on in front of you.
[01:42:48.401 --> 01:42:52.382]  I can't, because if I go do one story, I get hundreds of calls in Austin alone.
[01:42:52.382 --> 01:42:54.263]  I used to do these AXS TV shows.
[01:42:54.263 --> 01:42:55.203]  We've got to dig those out.
[01:42:55.203 --> 01:42:56.884]  I've got to get more interns in here or something.
[01:42:57.384 --> 01:43:05.500]  There's hundreds and hundreds of VHS tapes and three-quarter-inch tapes with all these reports I'd do where I'd go out and be an old lady on a walker begging and going...
[01:43:06.471 --> 01:43:08.351]  My daughter comes over three times a week.
[01:43:08.351 --> 01:43:11.212]  They say, just go on a nursing home and give the government my house.
[01:43:11.212 --> 01:43:16.413]  And they've put $57,000 on it in the last four weeks.
[01:43:16.413 --> 01:43:18.074]  And it's $2,000 more a day.
[01:43:18.074 --> 01:43:25.776]  And I had the guy mow it, and they're saying now, because there's a dead spot where the English Ivy died, they're still taking it.
[01:43:25.776 --> 01:43:28.356]  And the officer grabbed me around the neck.
[01:43:28.356 --> 01:43:31.317]  I don't know why this is happening in America.
[01:43:32.185 --> 01:43:33.965]  And I can't handle it!
[01:43:33.965 --> 01:43:37.846]  I can't sit there with sweet old ladies, folks, because you know what happens?
[01:43:37.846 --> 01:43:39.467]  I start wanting to kill people.
[01:43:39.467 --> 01:43:49.669]  I mean, I'm going to just be honest with you, because that's a normal tribal response, would be to pick up my club and go down the road to the hut of the guy that did this, but that isn't how society operates.
[01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:55.191]  People 5,000 years ago wouldn't do that to an old woman, because the warriors would kill them!
[01:43:56.812 --> 01:44:03.796]  Instead, they've taken our warrior society and they have turned it into a bunch of thugs feeding on the people.
[01:44:03.796 --> 01:44:06.197]  I've had it with you!
[01:44:06.197 --> 01:44:11.700]  And you rationalize and say, well, it's the law, and well, it's the, you know, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:12.821]  I just can't handle it.
[01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:18.614]  And it gets attention because there's still some Christians that'll stand up and fight.
[01:44:18.614 --> 01:44:22.057]  But other people, that's why they love all these third world people they're bringing in.
[01:44:22.057 --> 01:44:25.399]  And they're not bad people, they've just lived under bondage for hundreds of years.
[01:44:25.399 --> 01:44:29.042]  And, you know, from Mexico and Korea and everywhere else.
[01:44:29.042 --> 01:44:32.365]  And they'll put up with it!
[01:44:32.365 --> 01:44:38.750]  I mean, the Anglo-Saxons from 1215 on fought and fought and fought and fought to have a little bit of freedom.
[01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:40.271]  Very warlike, intelligent,
[01:44:41.383 --> 01:44:44.485]  A lot of ingenuity and inventiveness.
[01:44:44.485 --> 01:44:45.246]  Every culture.
[01:44:45.246 --> 01:44:45.846]  Great people.
[01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.868]  I love all of humanity.
[01:44:47.868 --> 01:44:55.593]  But instead, now that entire system of the little bit of freedom that was clawed out by millions of deaths is now being lost.
[01:44:55.593 --> 01:45:00.937]  You know how many people paid with their lives so your house could be your castle?
[01:45:00.937 --> 01:45:08.102]  And so the king's men, the local, you know, lord's men, the local barony,
[01:45:09.505 --> 01:45:17.230]  The local viceroy, the local thug wouldn't come with a bunch of guys with weapons and rape your wife and take your grain?
[01:45:17.230 --> 01:45:30.058]  Because it got so abusive, all of you listening, I don't care if you're African, white, whatever it is, you had ancestors that fought and clawed into the Renaissance by killing people.
[01:45:30.058 --> 01:45:34.060]  By fighting 10 to 1, 100 to 1 odds, so you'd have some freedom.
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:37.903]  You, everything we've got was paid for with blood, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:46.212]  Every bit of it was bought with blood.
[01:45:46.212 --> 01:45:49.832]  Outnumbered.
[01:45:49.832 --> 01:45:51.033]  Unarmed.
[01:45:51.033 --> 01:46:00.095]  Our ancestors, I don't care where you're from on the planet, if you have any history of liberty in your culture, and all of them do, it was paid for.
[01:46:00.095 --> 01:46:07.857]  And then people began worshipping liberty and freedom, instead of worshipping bureaucracy and parasitic control freakness.
[01:46:09.258 --> 01:46:12.199]  And you heard those pastors and that lawyer.
[01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:13.739]  They worship the government.
[01:46:13.739 --> 01:46:14.379]  They do.
[01:46:14.379 --> 01:46:16.400]  That's why I say it's God.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:19.001]  The government is God.
[01:46:19.001 --> 01:46:29.123]  People, you know, read Leviticus and they read the books of the law, which even if you're not a Christian or don't believe in that, the point is it's what our Magna Carta is based on.
[01:46:29.123 --> 01:46:37.366]  It was ancient Germanic law mixed with the Mosaic law.
[01:46:37.366 --> 01:46:38.486]  And it was all paid for.
[01:46:39.602 --> 01:46:40.202]  With blood.
[01:46:40.202 --> 01:46:51.146]  And in that law, you don't have the government, with no checks and balances, doing whatever it wants.
[01:46:51.146 --> 01:46:56.028]  And liberty and freedom is honored.
[01:46:56.028 --> 01:47:00.349]  And we have the reverse of that today.
[01:47:00.349 --> 01:47:02.310]  And we know what it leads to.
[01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:05.731]  To being completely robbed.
[01:47:05.731 --> 01:47:09.052]  Alright, I've got other guests coming up.
[01:47:12.463 --> 01:47:20.485]  But the last hour, we're going to have open phones on separate issues, but I've got, I guess, come up about eugenics.
[01:47:20.485 --> 01:47:24.286]  I wanted to get into all the other news.
[01:47:24.286 --> 01:47:31.387]  The government health care takeover, the water federalization takeover, the youth corps takeover is now openly happening.
[01:47:31.387 --> 01:47:34.748]  The environmental carbon tax takeover is now happening.
[01:47:36.121 --> 01:47:39.123]  I've got a bunch of financial news to go over as well.
[01:47:39.123 --> 01:47:51.533]  But make no mistake, global criminal syndicates are making their move against humanity.
[01:47:51.533 --> 01:47:52.794]  I'm just going to have him on a few minutes.
[01:47:52.794 --> 01:47:57.337]  I drug him on this morning because I saw gold was up like $12 and silver was up too.
[01:47:57.337 --> 01:48:00.379]  I know Ted had bought gold and silver again when it dipped for a while.
[01:48:01.721 --> 01:48:11.483]  You can get gold and silver at the lower price even though it's up right now and that's like buying a stock when it's higher from the price when it was lower.
[01:48:11.483 --> 01:48:19.104]  It's the smart move to do and Ted's got some great coins available and he hadn't been on in a while because he's been out of town in Europe trying to secure good deals on gold and silver.
[01:48:19.104 --> 01:48:23.905]  Ted Anderson, good to have you on with us while we still have some free speech left.
[01:48:23.905 --> 01:48:25.265]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:26.386]  Just watching what's going on.
[01:48:26.386 --> 01:48:28.646]  That last guest was just a perfect example of that.
[01:48:30.398 --> 01:48:31.518]  Here's what's going on, Alex.
[01:48:31.518 --> 01:48:33.739]  The market is coming back up again, obviously.
[01:48:33.739 --> 01:48:35.801]  Plenty of problems out there in the economy.
[01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:40.423]  We basically have handed over all powers over to the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:48:40.423 --> 01:48:45.286]  I would imagine that might have been influenced by HR 1207 coming in to audit them.
[01:48:45.286 --> 01:48:46.967]  They're just trying to grab for what they can.
[01:48:47.905 --> 01:48:52.269]  The market is starting to come back up again from this manipulation downward.
[01:48:52.269 --> 01:48:54.932]  It really gives me opportunities to buy.
[01:48:54.932 --> 01:48:56.033]  That's what I'm looking for.
[01:48:56.033 --> 01:49:02.639]  I'm looking for these little down ticks because usually I can save my customers anywhere from 5 to 20 to 30 percent.
[01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:09.606]  Some cases even as much as 40-50 percent because the market moves up so fast after they pushed it down.
[01:49:10.166 --> 01:49:18.190]  But what we do have right now, we have the Lakota coins, rather than being $20 apiece, they're right now at $19.70.
[01:49:18.190 --> 01:49:21.732]  And the Franks are at $2.22 rather than being up at $2.29.
[01:49:21.732 --> 01:49:28.035]  I got British Sovereigns right now at $2.75 rather than there being about $2.85.
[01:49:28.035 --> 01:49:30.977]  I'm sorry, yeah, $2.85.
[01:49:30.977 --> 01:49:38.901]  So the market is definitely showing signs that gold is strong and that things are going to be moving this direction.
[01:49:40.602 --> 01:49:48.526]  Just watching the government do all these bailouts and the printing press just running on over at the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:49:48.526 --> 01:49:56.570]  You just know that we're going to have inflation here and you just know that we're going to have ever decreasing value of our currency.
[01:49:56.570 --> 01:50:07.976]  And every single time that there's a hiccup in the economy or some company that needs to be bailed out that's part of the elite group is going to get their money and it's going to come out of the taxpayers' hide.
[01:50:08.556 --> 01:50:12.119]  And it just, you know, the whole thing just stinks to high heaven.
[01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:20.067]  And I just have to say that if the people were smart right now, and I'm not just talking about the Alex Jones listeners, but I'm talking about everybody that's out there.
[01:50:20.475 --> 01:50:33.663]  They'd get their buns out of cash, out of paper currency, out of fiat currency that's growing weaker every day because the Federal Reserve System is printing it, and get yourself into something that's real and hard like gold and silver.
[01:50:33.663 --> 01:50:35.184]  And get a good deal, which you're offering.
[01:50:35.184 --> 01:50:44.770]  Look, when the dumbbell yuppies figure out that they're tanking the dollar and going into hyperinflation, whenever that is in the next few years, you're not going to be able to get gold and silver hardly at any price.
[01:50:44.770 --> 01:50:46.811]  So you need to get into it now.
[01:50:46.811 --> 01:50:47.832]  The run-up you've seen
[01:50:48.772 --> 01:50:50.453]  And the price is only the beginning.
[01:50:50.453 --> 01:50:52.334]  That's what the smart money's on.
[01:50:52.334 --> 01:50:54.075]  And it's certainly better than fiat currency.
[01:50:54.075 --> 01:50:54.655]  Stay there, Ted.
[01:50:54.655 --> 01:50:58.798]  Tell folks about the coins you've got on the other side.
[01:50:58.798 --> 01:51:00.599]  But yeah, it's important.
[01:51:01.138 --> 01:51:07.361]  How would you like to cook any meal using no electricity or gas and cook your meals off the grid?
[01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:09.982]  Well, now you can, thanks to the Survival Oven.
[01:51:09.982 --> 01:51:17.746]  The Survival Oven is the most amazing off-grid solar oven that can cook anything that a conventional oven can without the energy bills.
[01:51:17.746 --> 01:51:29.832]  By condensing sunlight, the Survival Oven can produce temps up to 350 degrees, cook delicious and nutritious meals, sterilize water, dehydrate food, and so much more, all at zero operating costs.
[01:51:30.052 --> 01:51:30.292]  I think so.
[01:51:48.297 --> 01:51:52.743]  At less than 10 pounds, you can take Survival Solar Oven with you anywhere.
[01:51:52.743 --> 01:51:54.044]  Call 877-642-1553 or go to survivaloven.com.

[01:52:01.661 --> 01:52:07.703]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.703 --> 01:52:13.584]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.584 --> 01:52:19.726]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.006 --> 01:52:22.047]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.047 --> 01:52:24.509]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.509 --> 01:52:37.698]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.698 --> 01:52:39.359]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.359 --> 01:52:41.221]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:47.445]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.132 --> 01:52:56.388]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.388 --> 01:52:57.971]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.971 --> 01:52:59.173]  The people strike back!
[01:53:01.095 --> 01:53:03.096]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:53:03.096 --> 01:53:10.060]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:18.445]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:53:18.445 --> 01:53:24.169]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:53:24.349 --> 01:53:26.190]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:53:26.190 --> 01:53:28.370]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:32.911]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:53:32.911 --> 01:53:35.132]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:53:35.132 --> 01:53:42.954]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:53:43.134 --> 01:53:43.494]  We're good.
[01:54:12.264 --> 01:54:15.985]  We're going to look at black genocide inside the United States coming up in the next few weeks.
[01:54:15.985 --> 01:54:18.866]  We're going to look at Native American genocide on record.
[01:54:18.866 --> 01:54:21.147]  Declassified public.
[01:54:21.147 --> 01:54:23.428]  Taking little Indian kids.
[01:54:23.428 --> 01:54:24.748]  This is the last few years.
[01:54:24.748 --> 01:54:26.749]  Murdering them.
[01:54:26.749 --> 01:54:28.190]  Sterilizing them.
[01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:30.570]  Oh yeah, you think you can trust the government?
[01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:34.372]  We're going to put it all on display right here on air.
[01:54:34.372 --> 01:54:35.272]  Chapter and verse.
[01:54:35.272 --> 01:54:37.533]  You want to know who runs things?
[01:54:37.533 --> 01:54:38.493]  You want to live in denial?
[01:54:38.493 --> 01:54:39.053]  Not anymore.
[01:54:39.053 --> 01:54:40.294]  We're going to face the full horror.
[01:54:41.838 --> 01:54:43.919]  Only then can we bring these criminals to justice.
[01:54:43.919 --> 01:54:46.001]  I'm not risking my life for nothing.
[01:54:46.001 --> 01:54:46.661]  I'm going in 110%.
[01:54:46.661 --> 01:54:57.828]  You can call me soft because I love innocent people and I love goodness.
[01:54:57.828 --> 01:55:01.790]  The world's so corrupt, people can't even believe that I actually even have love in my heart.
[01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:03.732]  What does that say about you?
[01:55:03.732 --> 01:55:06.093]  What does that say about you?
[01:55:06.093 --> 01:55:10.496]  That you don't know how great it is
[01:55:11.852 --> 01:55:13.072]  To be on the side of goodness.
[01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:15.834]  Does that mean I'm on a high horse and perfect?
[01:55:15.834 --> 01:55:17.734]  No!
[01:55:17.734 --> 01:55:20.536]  It means this, I'm on the right side of history.
[01:55:20.536 --> 01:55:24.477]  No matter what happens to me, I did the right thing.
[01:55:24.477 --> 01:55:26.558]  And I got past my fears and engaged the enemy.
[01:55:26.558 --> 01:55:31.300]  And the longer you do it, the fear leaves you and all that's left is strength.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.301]  And a commitment to try to do better.
[01:55:33.301 --> 01:55:35.722]  Each and every time you engage the enemy in the info war.
[01:55:35.722 --> 01:55:40.824]  Alright, let's go back to Ted Anderson.
[01:55:42.844 --> 01:55:46.465]  Finishing up, tell folks the ratio.
[01:55:46.465 --> 01:55:49.866]  What you were telling me this morning, you bought gold and it was about $20 less than it is now.
[01:55:49.866 --> 01:55:52.646]  You bought silver and it was almost a dollar less than it is now.
[01:55:52.646 --> 01:55:55.607]  So you're passing on those prices.
[01:55:55.607 --> 01:55:59.668]  But again, every time you have a deal like this, some people wait and then it's gone.
[01:55:59.668 --> 01:56:04.969]  I just can't imagine people not wanting to have gold and silver, especially
[01:56:05.649 --> 01:56:17.860]  When all these big top financial sources, people that Ron Paul has sourced and cited as being very accurate in the past, are saying that they're getting ready for a bank holiday in September.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.082]  Now, that doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[01:56:20.082 --> 01:56:28.370]  It means, though, that the State Department is telling the embassies to get ready for it, or for complete war and to dump dollars and hoard their local currencies.
[01:56:30.987 --> 01:56:38.730]  Look, the world is so uncertain now, and the economy's so crazy, I don't understand how anybody, Ted, wouldn't move aggressively into silver and gold.
[01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:49.334]  Well, especially when you consider the fact that you're moving out of a fiat currency that's being printed like crazy to do these bailouts that our government's doing.
[01:56:49.334 --> 01:56:55.156]  I mean, to increase the money supply by 30%, 33%, coming up to 50%, what do you think's going to happen to the value of your money?
[01:56:58.917 --> 01:57:01.439]  I mean, what do you think is going to happen to your property rights?
[01:57:01.439 --> 01:57:04.881]  I mean, look what Michelle Bachman was saying about these dealers.
[01:57:04.881 --> 01:57:14.646]  I mean, people are losing $15 million businesses overnight because of a government regulation or, you know, some cars are or something.
[01:57:14.646 --> 01:57:16.527]  It's crazy what's going on out there.
[01:57:16.527 --> 01:57:19.689]  I don't know why anybody would want to be in this fiat currency, honestly.
[01:57:19.689 --> 01:57:22.911]  I mean, we're just so close to paying carbon taxes.
[01:57:22.911 --> 01:57:26.393]  That's the only key element that it would take to have world government.
[01:57:27.110 --> 01:57:29.791]  You know, that's the last cog in the wheel that needs to be done.
[01:57:29.791 --> 01:57:41.114]  They need to collect a world tax in order to have a world bank and a world currency, and then they can dictate to us what our policy is going to be here in any segment of politics.
[01:57:41.114 --> 01:57:48.496]  And so, you know, I just need to say that if you don't put yourself on a gold and silver standard, yourself personally, because the government isn't going to do it,
[01:57:49.356 --> 01:57:50.758]  I think you're nuts.
[01:57:50.758 --> 01:57:55.782]  Ted, Ted, I'm even freaked out now, even though I've been knowing this was coming for years in the setup.
[01:57:55.782 --> 01:58:00.266]  They're now moving faster than I even thought because I think they are trying to play catch-up.
[01:58:00.266 --> 01:58:06.971]  Openly a federal bill to say even rainwater on your land means total federal control jurisdiction over 100% of the U.S.
[01:58:06.971 --> 01:58:09.594]  Openly that a Congress, even people for it, admit that.
[01:58:10.494 --> 01:58:13.137]  Bills to openly set up all the youth corps.
[01:58:13.137 --> 01:58:15.098]  Bills to have the climate tax.
[01:58:15.098 --> 01:58:17.140]  Folks, get prepared.
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:18.041]  Nothing is perfect.
[01:58:18.041 --> 01:58:19.342]  There's no silver bullet.
[01:58:19.342 --> 01:58:21.103]  But at least get out of their fiat system.
[01:58:21.103 --> 01:58:21.664]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:21.664 --> 01:58:27.068]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:27.068 --> 01:58:29.090]  Brokers are there standing by.
[01:58:29.090 --> 01:58:31.612]  And Ted, did we even give people the gold and silver offer today?
[01:58:31.612 --> 01:58:33.634]  Or have we been too busy ranting about this?
[01:58:33.634 --> 01:58:34.554]  Well, what kind of ranting?
[01:58:34.554 --> 01:58:35.355]  What I'd suggest is the
[01:58:35.435 --> 01:58:36.016]  We'll stay there.
[01:58:36.016 --> 01:58:36.296]  Hold on.
[01:58:36.296 --> 01:58:38.098]  Go ahead and get our guest on.
[01:58:38.098 --> 01:58:41.982]  I'm going to bring you back for one minute on the other side, Ted.

[02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:31.072]  to 3 p.m.
[02:00:31.072 --> 02:00:32.213]  Central Standard Time.

[02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:08.193]  And shortwave and internet stream listeners, number one on Shoutcast.
[02:01:08.193 --> 02:01:11.475]  But we want to really be number one on the podcast.
[02:01:11.475 --> 02:01:12.576]  We're a long way away from that.
[02:01:12.576 --> 02:01:16.619]  Some of the bigger podcasts, you know, have 200,000 plus.
[02:01:16.619 --> 02:01:19.762]  So we're close, but, you know, still far away.
[02:01:19.762 --> 02:01:24.665]  So close, but yet so far away, as the song says, to being number one in podcasting.
[02:01:24.665 --> 02:01:29.809]  So we're looking forward to that, because that's people's minds, people's souls, unlocking under the New World Order.
[02:01:32.108 --> 02:01:37.533]  We're going to be talking to our guest after the break here in just a few minutes when some stations join us.
[02:01:37.533 --> 02:01:42.997]  Maafa is the film, 21st Century Black Genocide, in the United States.
[02:01:42.997 --> 02:01:48.161]  We cover this in Endgame, but more like ten minutes of the two-hour film is on that.
[02:01:48.161 --> 02:01:49.282]  This is all about it.
[02:01:49.282 --> 02:01:52.965]  You want full detail, incredible film, available at Infowars.com.
[02:01:55.072 --> 02:01:59.054]  And of course, you can also get it with Endgame.
[02:01:59.054 --> 02:02:02.316]  And we discount Endgame with this film, because they really go together.
[02:02:02.316 --> 02:02:09.840]  And this film actually, maafa, actually that's an African word, and we'll get the details of that on the other side of the next break, here in just a minute or two.
[02:02:11.738 --> 02:02:17.522]  For genocide or for what's happening, but there is in-game blueprint for global enslavement with Maafa.
[02:02:17.522 --> 02:02:20.263]  So these two go together like a horse and carriage.
[02:02:20.263 --> 02:02:27.407]  We'll be talking to our guest who does a lot of great work on the other side of this quick break.
[02:02:27.407 --> 02:02:33.891]  They are pro-life activists, finally really getting aggressive and going after Planned Parenthood for the open Nazis they are.
[02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:37.634]  So if more people take this tack, we'll defeat these people very, very quickly.
[02:02:38.534 --> 02:02:41.998]  But finishing up with Ted Anderson in the two minutes we've got left in this quick segment.
[02:02:41.998 --> 02:02:49.848]  Ted, owner of Genesis, owner of Minus Resources, you are the place I go to get my gold and silver because it's where I get the best price.
[02:02:49.848 --> 02:02:50.809]  Kind of like I got
[02:02:53.621 --> 02:03:03.847]  The food company we have, the J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoodsDirect.com, is because I bought a bunch of different storable food and didn't like it, MSG, or too expensive, or tasted like crud.
[02:03:03.847 --> 02:03:06.489]  Their stuff was great, so I said, hey, I like your stuff, will you be a sponsor?
[02:03:06.489 --> 02:03:07.950]  And they've been a sponsor now the last few years.
[02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:09.150]  It's the same with you.
[02:03:09.150 --> 02:03:15.434]  I mean, you've got, I buy gold and silver from you because, and I buy the deals you offer here on air.
[02:03:15.434 --> 02:03:17.415]  These are my favorite type deals.
[02:03:17.415 --> 02:03:19.717]  Tell folks quickly about today's special.
[02:03:20.057 --> 02:03:23.900]  Yeah, right now we have the Lakota coin at $19.70.
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:30.204]  Now, silver is about to break through that $14 range, and that's going to push that right up above $20 again.
[02:03:30.204 --> 02:03:34.526]  And there isn't anybody else out there that's selling those things for less than $20.
[02:03:34.526 --> 02:03:36.488]  So that is a really good buy.
[02:03:36.488 --> 02:03:40.090]  And then, of course, the British Sovereign, if you're looking for gold, it's a quarter-ounce piece.
[02:03:40.503 --> 02:03:42.504]  They're currently right now at $2.75.
[02:03:42.504 --> 02:03:45.164]  The Franks are at $2.22.
[02:03:45.164 --> 02:03:46.905]  Both of those coins are really good.
[02:03:46.905 --> 02:03:48.505]  We have a wide variety of things.
[02:03:48.505 --> 02:03:52.206]  If you're interested in buffalos or if you're looking at, you know, I've got pandas.
[02:03:52.206 --> 02:03:53.946]  I've got a whole long line of different products.
[02:03:53.946 --> 02:03:56.507]  I really don't have enough time to talk about everything.
[02:03:56.507 --> 02:03:58.467]  I try to buy when the market's down.
[02:03:58.467 --> 02:04:05.849]  I mean, nobody knows for sure when the bottom is going to hit, but when I see that thing being pushed down, you know, I just know there's manipulation that's going on.
[02:04:05.849 --> 02:04:08.290]  There's manipulation going on in every market right now.
[02:04:08.490 --> 02:04:11.691]  Yeah, that's why it's been pogo-sticking, but pogo-sticking upwards.
[02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:15.532]  The graph goes up and down, but it's moving up overall.
[02:04:15.532 --> 02:04:19.653]  And so, what else is doing as good as gold and silver in the last five years?
[02:04:19.653 --> 02:04:20.454]  Nothing.
[02:04:20.454 --> 02:04:21.714]  And everything else is losing.
[02:04:21.714 --> 02:04:23.014]  So, folks, give the brokers a call.
[02:04:23.014 --> 02:04:24.735]  They'll be there until midnight tonight.
[02:04:24.735 --> 02:04:29.656]  How long can you hold this special, with it being the prices of when gold was $20 cheaper?
[02:04:29.656 --> 02:04:35.058]  Well, I can tell you, I don't know what gold is going to do in the morning tomorrow, but I will hold it until midnight tonight for sure.
[02:04:35.538 --> 02:04:35.918]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:35.918 --> 02:04:37.640]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:43.605]  Ted Anderson, gold's normally way down in the summer.
[02:04:43.605 --> 02:04:44.906]  Here it is way up.
[02:04:44.906 --> 02:04:48.850]  Take this buying opportunity now to get the lower price while it's high.
[02:04:48.850 --> 02:04:50.692]  It's a great investment in my view.
[02:04:50.692 --> 02:04:52.453]  But there is no silver bullet.
[02:04:52.453 --> 02:04:53.354]  Except for maybe silver.
[02:04:53.354 --> 02:04:53.734]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:53.734 --> 02:04:56.657]  Thanks, Ted.
[02:04:56.657 --> 02:04:58.138]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:04:58.138 --> 02:04:59.480]  We'll be back with our guest.
[02:05:00.831 --> 02:05:06.693]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[02:05:06.693 --> 02:05:07.994]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:05:07.994 --> 02:05:12.275]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:05:12.275 --> 02:05:14.136]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:05:14.136 --> 02:05:20.439]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:05:21.579 --> 02:05:24.440]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:26.181]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:05:26.181 --> 02:05:29.182]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:05:29.182 --> 02:05:30.903]  And their formula really works.
[02:05:30.903 --> 02:05:33.724]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:05:33.724 --> 02:05:35.205]  Try the NutriCafe.
[02:05:35.205 --> 02:05:39.987]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:05:39.987 --> 02:05:42.388]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:05:42.388 --> 02:05:44.869]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:05:44.869 --> 02:05:46.950]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:48.531]  Go to www.
[02:05:49.972 --> 02:05:52.296]  We're good to go.
[02:06:00.919 --> 02:06:06.124]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:06.124 --> 02:06:10.147]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:10.147 --> 02:06:16.052]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:16.052 --> 02:06:21.116]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.116 --> 02:06:27.462]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:06:27.642 --> 02:06:31.225]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:06:31.225 --> 02:06:34.889]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:34.889 --> 02:06:39.594]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.594 --> 02:06:45.339]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:06:45.339 --> 02:06:48.322]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[02:06:48.482 --> 02:06:50.023]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:06:50.023 --> 02:06:51.785]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:06:51.785 --> 02:06:54.367]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:06:54.367 --> 02:06:57.009]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.575 --> 02:07:01.956]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.956 --> 02:07:03.958]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:07:03.958 --> 02:07:04.939]  Well, you should.
[02:07:04.939 --> 02:07:09.424]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:07:09.424 --> 02:07:10.245]  That's right.
[02:07:10.245 --> 02:07:18.893]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:07:18.893 --> 02:07:20.255]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:07:20.255 --> 02:07:21.416]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:07:21.596 --> 02:07:27.580]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:34.484]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:07:34.484 --> 02:07:40.008]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:07:40.008 --> 02:07:41.469]  This is real.
[02:07:41.469 --> 02:07:42.529]  Don't miss out.
[02:07:42.529 --> 02:07:49.394]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit or pennies on the dollar.
[02:07:49.614 --> 02:07:51.075]  And get your free handgun.

[02:07:53.436 --> 02:07:57.138]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:07:57.138 --> 02:08:02.521]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:08:02.521 --> 02:08:09.164]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.164 --> 02:08:12.146]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.141 --> 02:08:27.171]  Well, I've actually seen some of the television productions they've done because one of my friends, George Woolley, a pro-life activist, has aired some of the video here in Austin on Local Access.
[02:08:28.505 --> 02:08:33.007]  Mark Crutcher is with LifeDynamics.com.
[02:08:33.007 --> 02:08:39.710]  We'll throw that up on screen for people watching us at PrisonPlanet.tv as we simulcast with a radio show throughout this hour.
[02:08:39.710 --> 02:08:44.933]  Later in the hour, we're going to open the phones up to talk about black genocide, Native American genocide.
[02:08:44.933 --> 02:08:49.055]  And again, 99% of whites don't know this is going on.
[02:08:49.055 --> 02:08:50.596]  But it was George Bush Sr.
[02:08:50.596 --> 02:08:51.016]  when he was
[02:08:52.403 --> 02:08:59.446]  Working for Nixon, who actually carried out sterilization, this is mainstream news, and abortions on the Native American reservations.
[02:08:59.446 --> 02:09:05.308]  So, if you want the big socialized healthcare of Obama, get ready, because that's what it means.
[02:09:05.308 --> 02:09:09.930]  The same stuff that the Bureau of Indian Affairs gives people in the VA.
[02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:20.574]  But they've made a new film that is really impressive, and it gets into this whole history of black genocide.
[02:09:21.658 --> 02:09:22.678]  Looking for it in here.
[02:09:22.678 --> 02:09:24.459]  I had it in here.
[02:09:24.459 --> 02:09:24.939]  Oh, here it is.
[02:09:24.939 --> 02:09:26.340]  It's underneath Endgame.
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:32.942]  It's Ma Afa, Black Genocide in the 21st Century in America.
[02:09:32.942 --> 02:09:36.584]  And it's just an excellent film that everybody needs to see.
[02:09:36.584 --> 02:09:45.667]  Because, like I said earlier, my film Endgame gets into the whole eugenics operation and how that's the religion of the New World Order in their own words.
[02:09:45.667 --> 02:09:46.608]  A religion of death.
[02:09:46.608 --> 02:09:47.468]  They love death.
[02:09:49.065 --> 02:09:50.967]  They that hate me love death.
[02:09:50.967 --> 02:09:55.512]  And so that's why abortion is a sacrament to these people.
[02:09:55.512 --> 02:09:56.753]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:09:56.753 --> 02:10:00.897]  I mean, I come at this from a secular analysis.
[02:10:00.897 --> 02:10:08.264]  I am a Christian, but I don't let that be a rose-colored darkly, though it really gives me discernment.
[02:10:08.264 --> 02:10:10.887]  I look at things just coldly and analyze the history.
[02:10:12.878 --> 02:10:15.319]  And then I emotionally rally people to fight against it.
[02:10:15.319 --> 02:10:16.860]  But it is very, very real.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:20.961]  So we appreciate Mark Crutcher for coming on the show and for producing this film.
[02:10:20.961 --> 02:10:21.722]  Mark, good to have you here.
[02:10:21.722 --> 02:10:22.522]  Thank you, sir.
[02:10:22.522 --> 02:10:24.343]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:10:24.343 --> 02:10:35.507]  So tell us about your journey, your organization, what you do generally, and how it led you deeper down the rabbit hole to really the fount of this Planned Parenthood evil.
[02:10:35.507 --> 02:10:40.009]  Well, we're a pro-life organization, as you know, and we do a lot of different pro-life things.
[02:10:40.009 --> 02:10:41.150]  We do a lot of undercover work.
[02:10:42.230 --> 02:10:50.121]  I'll be familiar with some of our work exposing the trafficking of baby body parts, how the abortion clinics chop up the babies they kill and sell them for parts.
[02:10:50.121 --> 02:10:51.402]  Yes, I want to talk about all that.
[02:10:51.402 --> 02:10:55.267]  I want to, many times, but to have you on and for some reason it never happens.
[02:10:55.267 --> 02:10:57.250]  So this is hopefully the first of many interviews.
[02:10:57.250 --> 02:10:58.492]  Yeah, tell us all about it.
[02:10:58.872 --> 02:11:01.074]  Well, that's it.
[02:11:01.074 --> 02:11:02.255]  That's a whole show by itself.
[02:11:02.255 --> 02:11:10.121]  But basically, that's another profit center for the abortion lobby is to chop up these babies and sell them for spare parts.
[02:11:10.121 --> 02:11:14.064]  And it's a fairly profitable endeavor that they've got going.
[02:11:14.064 --> 02:11:15.525]  We have no idea how large it is.
[02:11:15.525 --> 02:11:16.586]  We know it's still going on.
[02:11:17.205 --> 02:11:24.148]  We were undercover in an abortion clinic in Overland Park, Kansas for 31 months and came out with all the documentation on it.
[02:11:24.148 --> 02:11:31.350]  They actually put out brochures, just like you get on a new car or something, talking about how they sell the body parts.
[02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:38.513]  Then we also did an undercover investigation on the fact that Planned Parenthood is running a nationwide pedophile protection racket.
[02:11:38.513 --> 02:11:42.675]  They're protecting the men who sexually abuse and rape children.
[02:11:42.675 --> 02:11:43.535]  And we proved it.
[02:11:44.239 --> 02:11:48.681]  And I'll say it right here on your show, they're running a nationwide pedophile protection racket.
[02:11:48.681 --> 02:11:54.863]  If that's not true, that's libel and slander on its face, and they would have sued me the first time I said it seven years ago.
[02:11:54.863 --> 02:11:59.364]  I've said it on over 200 national and local television and radio stations.
[02:11:59.364 --> 02:12:01.105]  They've never even once contacted me.
[02:12:01.533 --> 02:12:06.216]  Yeah, for those that don't know, I should have read your bio for people, but it's so lengthy.
[02:12:06.216 --> 02:12:09.098]  You're on syndicated radio, TV.
[02:12:09.098 --> 02:12:11.739]  I mean, you reach millions of people every week.
[02:12:11.739 --> 02:12:15.642]  You might tell folks how big your ministry is, and they just back off and shut up.
[02:12:15.642 --> 02:12:18.803]  And see, I never knew this stuff either, but over the decades, that's what I found out.
[02:12:19.804 --> 02:12:26.406]  Devil-worshipping pedophiles basically run the New World Order, the global government, and they love death, they love killing babies.
[02:12:26.406 --> 02:12:27.866]  But, please continue.
[02:12:27.866 --> 02:12:32.347]  So, body parts, pedophile rings, black genocide, yes.
[02:12:32.347 --> 02:12:43.630]  Yeah, now, one of the things that those of us in the pro-life movement have always known is that there was a strong racial element to the motivation behind the legalization of abortion.
[02:12:43.630 --> 02:12:48.051]  And so, about three years ago, we launched an investigation into this.
[02:12:50.208 --> 02:13:01.931]  What we have found, I mean, I've been in the pro-life battle for 30 years, I've been working in it full-time for 23 years, and Alex, I've learned things in the last three years that I never dreamed of.
[02:13:01.931 --> 02:13:09.192]  I work in this 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the stuff that we've learned in the last three years is mind-boggling.
[02:13:09.192 --> 02:13:12.053]  And it is absolutely
[02:13:12.745 --> 02:13:19.410]  Undeniable now that racism was a primary motivation, if not the primary motivation.
[02:13:19.410 --> 02:13:25.954]  As a matter of fact, I would go so far as to say it was the primary motivation for the legalization of abortion to begin with.
[02:13:25.954 --> 02:13:39.143]  And what we did is we went back, and as you've seen in the DVD, we actually start at the time prior to the end of slavery, when not all white people, and not even all wealthy white people,
[02:13:39.827 --> 02:13:54.456]  But a certain select group of super-wealthy white elitists began to wonder what was going to happen, or actually worry about what was going to happen when the end of slavery came, because they saw it was coming.
[02:13:54.456 --> 02:13:58.819]  And we're talking about in the late 1700s, early 1800s, and up until the mid-1800s.
[02:13:58.819 --> 02:14:03.502]  These people clearly saw that the end of slavery was going to occur one day.
[02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:04.743]  They didn't know when, but they were
[02:14:05.427 --> 02:14:13.090]  Very alarmed at what was going to happen, and not from the standpoint of insurrection, which is what a lot of people talk about.
[02:14:13.090 --> 02:14:17.011]  The wealthy elite can always insulate themselves from insurrection.
[02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:19.272]  That's not their problem.
[02:14:19.272 --> 02:14:22.253]  What they were concerned about is the economic impact.
[02:14:22.253 --> 02:14:27.875]  For the most part, these are the people, this wealthy elite, this small cadre of wealthy elitists,
[02:14:28.976 --> 02:14:31.338]  Were the people who had most profit from slavery.
[02:14:31.338 --> 02:14:36.702]  They had made billions on the backs of Africans that they had brought in here from Africa.
[02:14:36.702 --> 02:14:43.486]  And it had been Christians that ended that, just like Christians are going to end their murder of babies again, but go ahead.
[02:14:43.486 --> 02:14:44.347]  Absolutely.
[02:14:44.347 --> 02:14:57.376]  But, they began to wonder what the economic impact was going to be of releasing four million people into the economy that they had kept artificially ignorant and unemployable.
[02:14:58.810 --> 02:15:06.698]  If you were black in the 1830s and you were set free, you only had one job skill, and that was to work on the cotton plantation.
[02:15:06.698 --> 02:15:15.325]  So what was going to be the impact of this is what concerned them, and their first idea was what's called colonization.
[02:15:15.325 --> 02:15:18.188]  They were going to just send all the slaves back to Africa.
[02:15:18.188 --> 02:15:22.232]  That failed miserably, even though it was widely embraced in our government.
[02:15:22.232 --> 02:15:23.333]  The United States Congress
[02:15:24.028 --> 02:15:29.950]  What most people don't know is the United States Congress actually funded the American Colonization Society.
[02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:33.352]  So it was a very seriously taken concept.
[02:15:33.352 --> 02:15:34.612]  It just didn't work.
[02:15:34.612 --> 02:15:39.914]  And it's interesting when you start studying these things, Alex.
[02:15:39.914 --> 02:15:45.436]  You know, if you put things on a timeline, which is how we started this, we did it like a criminal investigation.
[02:15:45.436 --> 02:15:51.538]  We put things on a timeline starting in like in the early 1800s and continuing up to 2009.
[02:15:51.538 --> 02:15:52.979]  And one of the things that you see is
[02:15:54.668 --> 02:16:04.312]  Every time this small group of elitists tried something and it didn't work, all of a sudden there was something else to try.
[02:16:04.312 --> 02:16:13.736]  And it's interesting that when colonization failed, it's exactly the same moment when there was a new philosophy introduced in the world called eugenics.
[02:16:13.736 --> 02:16:21.679]  The man who actually coined the term eugenics, or the word eugenics, is now today called the father of eugenics.
[02:16:24.973 --> 02:16:43.158]  He, his name was Francis Galton, his family was extraordinarily wealthy, they had made their money from the slave trade, and he came up with this philosophy called eugenics, and basically what it is, is absolutely no different than what Hitler did, is the creation of the master race.
[02:16:43.158 --> 02:16:44.939]  And he thought that the world could
[02:16:46.505 --> 02:16:52.927]  Manipulate the human condition to the point that we could do a better job than what God did.
[02:16:52.927 --> 02:16:57.729]  Basically, their theory was God did well as far as he went, but we can make it better.
[02:16:57.729 --> 02:16:58.830]  And they really believed this.
[02:16:58.830 --> 02:17:02.311]  The Galtons and the Darwins and others were all intermarried.
[02:17:02.311 --> 02:17:06.893]  And they have like nine kids and eight of them would die and the other one would be retarded.
[02:17:06.893 --> 02:17:10.474]  And they still thought, though, this was genius and beauty.
[02:17:10.474 --> 02:17:15.176]  So they really believed that they were creating a new super race.
[02:17:15.436 --> 02:17:17.338]  Absolutely.
[02:17:17.338 --> 02:17:23.064]  I knew who Darwin was and I knew who Galton was before we even started this project.
[02:17:23.064 --> 02:17:26.787]  What I didn't know is that they were first cousins.
[02:17:26.787 --> 02:17:32.873]  Charles Darwin and Francis Galton were first cousins and they worked together on these projects.
[02:17:32.873 --> 02:17:36.757]  What you start to see as you start unraveling all of this is that
[02:17:37.816 --> 02:17:43.740]  Basically, Darwin was the philosopher, and Galton was the guy who put all this stuff into practice.
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.021]  He was called the bulldog.
[02:17:45.021 --> 02:17:47.462]  Right.
[02:17:47.462 --> 02:17:55.527]  Galton, I mean, sorry, the eugenicists first started out with a plan that was basically what you might call passive eugenics.
[02:17:55.527 --> 02:18:03.833]  They believed that not only were Africans inferior intellectually to whites, they believed they were inferior physically as well.
[02:18:05.006 --> 02:18:09.367]  And that unless they had direction from the white community, they couldn't survive.
[02:18:09.367 --> 02:18:11.487]  They couldn't live without us.
[02:18:11.487 --> 02:18:18.969]  So they set up the social welfare net and racial hygiene health departments and that's our CPS in Planned Parenthood today.
[02:18:18.969 --> 02:18:20.249]  That's what it evolved into.
[02:18:20.249 --> 02:18:21.409]  That's what it evolved into.
[02:18:21.409 --> 02:18:31.151]  And what we do is we take everything on a step-by-step basis and we connect the dots from the failure of colonization to the success of abortion.
[02:18:32.276 --> 02:18:43.323]  And we show all the stages that these people went through, from passive eugenics, to positive eugenics, to negative eugenics, to birth control, to sterilization, and ultimately to abortion.
[02:18:43.323 --> 02:18:54.130]  And when you start putting this thing on a timeline, you keep seeing all these things pop up where X failed, and exactly on that time, here's this new strategy.
[02:18:54.130 --> 02:18:56.431]  And when that failed, here's this new strategy.
[02:18:56.431 --> 02:19:01.054]  And they kept doing that until they came up with the one that worked, which was abortion.
[02:19:01.054 --> 02:19:01.194]  Now,
[02:19:01.989 --> 02:19:08.334]  And we document things in this video I don't think most people understand or don't know.
[02:19:08.334 --> 02:19:11.036]  I certainly didn't know.
[02:19:11.036 --> 02:19:20.303]  The eugenics movement had really settled on the idea of forced sterilization as the way they would control the world's population.
[02:19:20.303 --> 02:19:22.525]  34 states had passed that.
[02:19:22.525 --> 02:19:25.247]  Yes, over 30 states had.
[02:19:25.247 --> 02:19:28.289]  Actual eugenics boards, state eugenics boards.
[02:19:28.289 --> 02:19:29.390]  Over 30 states had them.
[02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:30.631]  The first one was in Indiana.
[02:19:31.704 --> 02:19:36.766]  And this is not something that happened just back in the 1910s or the 1920s.
[02:19:36.766 --> 02:19:37.926]  No, this went on to the 80s.
[02:19:37.926 --> 02:19:39.267]  Amazing film.
[02:19:39.267 --> 02:19:40.247]  It covers it all.
[02:19:40.247 --> 02:19:46.129]  It takes a snapshot that's an endgame and blows it way up in full, stunning detail.
[02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:50.591]  You know somebody who's black who thinks Planned Parenthood loves him and Obama loves him?
[02:19:50.591 --> 02:19:52.932]  When he, by the way, doubled the funding for Africa for this stuff?
[02:19:53.712 --> 02:19:54.993]  You need to find out the truth.
[02:19:54.993 --> 02:19:57.814]  You need to get this film at Infowars.com.
[02:19:57.814 --> 02:20:00.835]  I'll also give you their site to be able to get it as well.
[02:20:00.835 --> 02:20:01.256]  Stay with us.

[02:21:01.031 --> 02:21:02.713]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:21:02.713 --> 02:21:04.455]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:21:04.455 --> 02:21:12.284]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:21:12.284 --> 02:21:15.467]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:21:15.467 --> 02:21:18.951]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:21:19.375 --> 02:21:31.920]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:34.241]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:21:34.241 --> 02:21:35.642]  I use one every day.
[02:21:35.642 --> 02:21:38.103]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:21:38.363 --> 02:21:39.063]  We're good to go.
[02:22:01.650 --> 02:22:07.674]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.674 --> 02:22:13.559]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:22:13.559 --> 02:22:19.723]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:20.043 --> 02:22:22.024]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:22.024 --> 02:22:24.484]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:24.484 --> 02:22:37.668]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.668 --> 02:22:39.349]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:41.209]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.209 --> 02:22:47.431]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.115 --> 02:22:56.362]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.362 --> 02:22:57.944]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.944 --> 02:22:59.145]  The people strike back!
[02:23:00.745 --> 02:23:01.785]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:23:01.785 --> 02:23:06.727]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:23:06.727 --> 02:23:14.810]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:23:14.810 --> 02:23:20.392]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:23:20.392 --> 02:23:27.355]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:23:27.655 --> 02:23:33.259]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:23:33.259 --> 02:23:38.322]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:23:38.322 --> 02:23:46.267]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:23:46.267 --> 02:23:52.831]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:23:52.831 --> 02:23:53.951]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:56.693 --> 02:23:56.954]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:16.277 --> 02:24:22.742]  And you can tell he really cares, and they were a small organization, but in the last few decades they've reached tens of millions of people.
[02:24:22.742 --> 02:24:30.669]  We see the polls going from the majority of Americans being for abortion to the majority now being against, and even the media admits, oh my god, people know it's a baby now.
[02:24:30.669 --> 02:24:34.472]  They're not, you know, stop driving around with those cars with dead babies as other groups do.
[02:24:34.472 --> 02:24:35.032]  Stop, stop.
[02:24:36.556 --> 02:24:38.998]  As if that's bad, but the act is okay.
[02:24:38.998 --> 02:24:40.660]  No, people are winning.
[02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:45.504]  We're winning by telling the truth, and to use abortion as birth control, ladies and gentlemen, is very wicked.
[02:24:45.504 --> 02:24:47.726]  They always love to advertise, like, oh, you're against birth control.
[02:24:48.553 --> 02:25:00.298]  No, this is murder, and now it's babies out of the womb, and now the bioethicists are coming out and saying, and the eugenicists, oh, we need to go ahead and get rid of babies after they're born.
[02:25:00.298 --> 02:25:08.621]  This is in the mainstream news, so LifeDynamics.com, short segment now, Mark Crutcher's on with us, the film is Ma Afa.
[02:25:09.421 --> 02:25:11.223]  Black Genocide of 21st Century America.
[02:25:11.223 --> 02:25:17.509]  Describe what the name means, and then continue where you left off about abortion worked for them.
[02:25:17.509 --> 02:25:25.696]  This is only one slice of eugenics, but devastating to show people why Time and Newsweek call her, you know, Woman of the Year before.
[02:25:25.696 --> 02:25:31.261]  They put her in the top 100 women in history, say she's a great liberal, who call black people subhuman weeds.
[02:25:31.261 --> 02:25:33.043]  Yeah, well actually our video is called MAFA 21.
[02:25:33.043 --> 02:25:33.524]  MAFA is the
[02:25:35.789 --> 02:25:41.931]  A term that's used by many in the African-American community to describe the time of slavery.
[02:25:41.931 --> 02:25:48.072]  It's a Swahili word that means tragedy or calamity or something like that.
[02:25:48.072 --> 02:25:50.693]  And they call that time in history Maafa.
[02:25:50.693 --> 02:25:56.235]  And our argument is that the Maafa did not end when the slaves were set free.
[02:25:56.235 --> 02:25:57.515]  It continues to this day.
[02:25:57.515 --> 02:26:00.796]  And I think we've made a compelling case for that in this video.
[02:26:00.796 --> 02:26:02.016]  And that's why we call it Maafa 21.
[02:26:02.016 --> 02:26:03.257]  It's Maafa in the 21st century.
[02:26:06.112 --> 02:26:14.080]  Yeah, as I was saying a moment ago, sterilization was their big tool, but in the 60s they began to lose sterilization.
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:22.147]  The federal courts were starting to rule that these eugenics boards, these state eugenics boards and state sterilization boards, were unconstitutional.
[02:26:22.147 --> 02:26:31.936]  And it was at that time, for the first time in American history, that the eugenics movement then switched over and started embracing and again calling for the legalization of abortion.
[02:26:32.896 --> 02:26:40.422]  It's also at this time that blacks began to stand up and demand their constitutional rights and say, we're not going to take this nonsense anymore.
[02:26:40.422 --> 02:26:43.184]  And all of these three things converged at one point.
[02:26:43.184 --> 02:26:46.686]  You had the courts ruling against sterilization boards.
[02:26:46.686 --> 02:26:52.330]  You had the blacks standing up and saying, we're not going to be pushed around like this anymore.
[02:26:52.330 --> 02:27:01.817]  And then by and just, I guess some people would say an enormous cosmic coincidence, the eugenics movement says, okay, if we can't have sterilization anymore, we're going to start calling for the legalization of abortion.
[02:27:02.441 --> 02:27:08.890]  And then suddenly, let me just add, they've set up the health boards, set up the eugenics boards of the health department, racial hygiene.
[02:27:08.890 --> 02:27:16.860]  Germany, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, as you know, for those that don't, adopts the US-British model and Hitler writes them on comp.
[02:27:17.441 --> 02:27:21.702]  Thanking the United States and how wonderful it is and for teaching him all of this.
[02:27:21.702 --> 02:27:27.304]  And now he's going to do this to the Jews and gypsies and Germans who had any health problems in their life.
[02:27:27.304 --> 02:27:32.585]  If you had a defective heart, they'd come grab your kids and kill them and say, oh they died of ruptured appendix.
[02:27:32.585 --> 02:27:38.007]  So the CPS, abortion, sterilization, that's all going on in Germany.
[02:27:38.007 --> 02:27:40.327]  They get embarrassed after World War II.
[02:27:40.327 --> 02:27:45.389]  The head of the UN, the Secretary General of UNESCO, Julian Huxley says,
[02:27:46.329 --> 02:27:48.650]  We'll call ourselves transhumanists now.
[02:27:48.650 --> 02:27:53.753]  So, suddenly in the 60s, the blacks are saying, you're not going to, you know, castrate me anymore.
[02:27:53.753 --> 02:27:55.374]  And so they say, you know what?
[02:27:55.374 --> 02:27:57.855]  We're going to pay your women to not have you in the house.
[02:27:57.855 --> 02:27:59.216]  We're going to break your families up.
[02:27:59.216 --> 02:28:01.557]  We're going to turn the cops loose on you.
[02:28:01.557 --> 02:28:04.519]  And we're going to make sure those women then later have abortions.
[02:28:04.519 --> 02:28:04.819]  Go ahead.
[02:28:04.819 --> 02:28:05.439]  Absolutely.
[02:28:05.439 --> 02:28:08.401]  And what you have to understand, too, you mentioned Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[02:28:08.401 --> 02:28:14.124]  The interesting thing is that the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was actually funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:28:14.964 --> 02:28:21.010]  And Rockefeller and Carnegie had... Rockefeller was the primary one, but Carnegie also put money into it.
[02:28:21.010 --> 02:28:28.797]  And they were the ones who also funded the American Eugenics Society in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, which is still there today.
[02:28:28.797 --> 02:28:30.919]  Oh, called the Human Genome Project?
[02:28:30.919 --> 02:28:31.920]  Oh, that one?
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:35.263]  No, it's now called the American Eugenics Record Office.
[02:28:36.419 --> 02:28:38.903]  Exactly, but I'm saying those two nexus in together.
[02:28:38.903 --> 02:28:39.825]  Absolutely.
[02:28:39.825 --> 02:28:45.816]  And we were able to get some of the information that's in this DVD that's never been released to the public.
[02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:48.401]  We were able to more or less trick them into giving it to us.
[02:28:49.111 --> 02:28:52.213]  Once they figured out what we were doing, they shut off the supplies.
[02:28:52.213 --> 02:28:55.176]  Yeah, continue with the history we're going to break, and we'll come back and tell about that.
[02:28:55.176 --> 02:29:00.960]  I mean, folks, you've got to get Maafa 21, Black Genocide in 21st Century America.
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:02.161]  Everybody's got to see this.
[02:29:02.161 --> 02:29:02.881]  You want to know?
[02:29:02.881 --> 02:29:07.545]  See, the smart white supremacists aren't got shaved heads and swastikas.
[02:29:07.545 --> 02:29:13.269]  In fact, those idiot, toothless people think when they're fighting a liberal establishment, they're fighting a bunch of, you know, liberals.
[02:29:14.069 --> 02:29:19.613]  The smart eugenicists are loving and liberal with ponytails and Birkenstocks.
[02:29:19.613 --> 02:29:21.115]  Hi!
[02:29:21.115 --> 02:29:21.935]  Oh!
[02:29:21.935 --> 02:29:24.037]  And they are just sicko filth.
[02:29:24.037 --> 02:29:32.963]  But you get behind closed doors with them, you go to a bench, you confront them, they'll just go, shut up, we're gonna get you soon, this country's ours, you're damn right, we're getting rid of them!
[02:29:32.963 --> 02:29:38.608]  And I mean, they are, again, the smart ones are, oh, hi, I'm liberal!
[02:29:39.108 --> 02:29:41.031]  I mean, very sick!
[02:29:41.031 --> 02:29:42.072]  Stay there, sir.

[02:32:00.756 --> 02:32:06.619]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:32:06.619 --> 02:32:07.919]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:32:07.919 --> 02:32:12.201]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:32:12.201 --> 02:32:14.062]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:32:14.062 --> 02:32:19.004]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[02:32:19.244 --> 02:32:19.764]  We're good to go.
[02:32:49.885 --> 02:32:52.206]  We're good to go.
[02:33:15.858 --> 02:33:22.904]  I saw Sheriff Don Brown came in to shoot me down.
[02:33:22.904 --> 02:33:28.409]  So I shot, I shot, I shot him down.
[02:33:28.409 --> 02:33:38.677]  And I say, if I am guilty I will pay.
[02:33:38.677 --> 02:33:43.942]  I shot the sheriff, and I say, but I didn't shoot the deputy.
[02:33:47.912 --> 02:34:00.027]  We have a right to self-defense, and I tell you, we're so blessed, ladies and gentlemen, to have somebody that reaches millions and millions of people like Mark Crutcher, really finding out about the eugenics.
[02:34:01.158 --> 02:34:13.363]  And you can hear his voice, because I've seen his TV show for at least six, seven, eight years, probably longer than that, and you know, they're real focused and serious, but I can hear almost the tremor in his voice when he says, I discovered things in the last three years.
[02:34:13.363 --> 02:34:14.503]  He can hardly talk.
[02:34:14.503 --> 02:34:15.884]  I'm the same way.
[02:34:15.884 --> 02:34:18.325]  That's why I'm interrupting every five seconds, because it's almost the opposite.
[02:34:18.325 --> 02:34:20.266]  I'm just jumping in going, yes, it's true.
[02:34:20.266 --> 02:34:21.486]  Yes, he's telling you the truth.
[02:34:21.486 --> 02:34:24.707]  Yes, this is what's really going on.
[02:34:24.707 --> 02:34:25.628]  And then you find out,
[02:34:26.417 --> 02:34:28.238]  That it's the fluoride in the water is eugenics.
[02:34:28.238 --> 02:34:30.038]  Then you find out the vaccines.
[02:34:30.038 --> 02:34:34.380]  Then you find out they've been caught, just London Guardian yesterday, sterilizing women in Africa.
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:36.581]  Folks, everything is eugenics.
[02:34:36.581 --> 02:34:39.262]  Everything is control of human mind, society.
[02:34:39.262 --> 02:34:43.324]  The Prozac, with 20% of the public on it, that's part of eugenics.
[02:34:43.324 --> 02:34:50.587]  But this is just focusing in on Maafa, which means the dark time, the slave time, the bad times, the slavery.
[02:34:51.755 --> 02:34:53.656]  Really, Genocide 21 is what it means.
[02:34:53.656 --> 02:34:57.338]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:34:57.338 --> 02:35:03.002]  And usually I have filmmakers on and don't even sit there and say, get it, get it, you gotta have it, you gotta get it!
[02:35:03.581 --> 02:35:08.523]  Give this to everybody you know who's black, especially, so they know Planned Parenthood isn't their friend.
[02:35:08.523 --> 02:35:10.344]  We can defeat these people.
[02:35:10.344 --> 02:35:12.065]  We can stop them if we're able to do this.
[02:35:12.065 --> 02:35:15.927]  Now, I'm going to try to shut up, go through the film, and then briefly I'm going to have you back up.
[02:35:15.927 --> 02:35:19.809]  Let's talk about the pedophile rings with Planned Parenthood.
[02:35:19.809 --> 02:35:27.192]  You're the guys and some other folks that would call Planned Parenthood and say, I want to give money just to kill the dirty blacks, and they'd, oh yes, we love getting rid of those.
[02:35:27.192 --> 02:35:28.513]  Your money will go directly to getting rid of them.
[02:35:29.153 --> 02:35:36.218]  I mean, people have trouble dealing with the magnitude of the wickedness of this group.
[02:35:36.218 --> 02:35:42.262]  It's just like when the neighbor gets caught who'd mow your lawn and water your plants with 20 dead bodies in their basement.
[02:35:42.262 --> 02:35:43.542]  You're like, I can't believe it.
[02:35:43.542 --> 02:35:48.285]  Well, you've got to get past that, folks, and look at the evidence covered in these films.
[02:35:48.285 --> 02:35:51.568]  I've got a little clip of Endgame coming up in just a moment, but go ahead, sir.
[02:35:51.568 --> 02:35:53.529]  Well, you mentioned a moment ago Floor Outta the Water.
[02:35:54.543 --> 02:36:09.533]  One of the things that we discovered is that back in the 60s, when they began to be concerned that they were going to lose sterilization and abortion at that point had not been legalized, one of the proposals that these people put forward was that the U.S.
[02:36:09.533 --> 02:36:15.497]  government should be putting birth control agents into the food and water supply.
[02:36:15.497 --> 02:36:19.840]  And this was widely discussed, widely embraced by people in the eugenics movement.
[02:36:20.487 --> 02:36:25.409]  It was discussed at a 1969 meeting of the United Nations.
[02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:27.569]  It was embraced by them.
[02:36:27.569 --> 02:36:32.751]  And when we started studying this idea, listen to how preposterous this was, Alex.
[02:36:32.751 --> 02:36:46.396]  Their proposal was that birth control agents could be put into the municipal food and water supplies, and then they would develop an anecdote to the birth control agents in the water.
[02:36:47.210 --> 02:36:53.934]  Which you could apply to the government for the right to purchase on the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:36:53.934 --> 02:37:01.578]  They were literally going to sell these certificates, basically, to have a baby on the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:37:01.578 --> 02:37:07.641]  And when we started studying this, it was almost... At times, Alex, I hate to say this, but we were laughing.
[02:37:07.641 --> 02:37:11.683]  It was so laughable, so funny, that these people were dead serious about this.
[02:37:12.210 --> 02:37:19.392]  Until, no I agree with you, until you realize they're actually doing it through covert means right now.
[02:37:19.392 --> 02:37:33.615]  In fact, the carbon tax they're admitting, notice they're now getting rid of the child credit in California, in Australia they're now going to tax you if you have more than one kid, and they admit this is how the Chinese one-child policy started in 75, became law 81, but go ahead.
[02:37:33.615 --> 02:37:34.095]  Absolutely.
[02:37:36.045 --> 02:37:48.492]  The interesting thing is, when we studied this idea of what happened to this idea of putting birth control agents in the food and water supply, the eugenics movement eventually abandoned it and then increased the cost for the legalization of abortion.
[02:37:48.492 --> 02:38:00.460]  Mainly because, not because they were morally, had a moral problem, these people don't have morals, but they did not abandon the putting the food, doctoring up the food and water supply with birth control.
[02:38:01.232 --> 02:38:08.154]  Because of moral concerns, they abandoned it because they concluded that it was impractical, that you really couldn't do it.
[02:38:08.154 --> 02:38:24.078]  One of the eugenicists we talk about in MAFA, one of these people actually said in this UN conference, he was representing the United States on this Population Council in the UN, he says, look, we couldn't stop the import and sale of alcohol.
[02:38:24.078 --> 02:38:25.658]  He said, how are we going to do this with water?
[02:38:25.658 --> 02:38:30.119]  He said, all we're going to do is we're going to create a black market for untreated water.
[02:38:30.973 --> 02:38:35.375]  He said, we're going to have speakeasies for water if we try to do this.
[02:38:35.375 --> 02:38:40.919]  Now, he wasn't opposed to the idea as a philosophy, just that it wasn't practical.
[02:38:40.919 --> 02:38:45.561]  And then the idea was put forward about doing this in foreign countries.
[02:38:45.561 --> 02:38:52.385]  And it was shot down there because they said the countries whose population we need control are the black countries in Africa.
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:58.963]  And the vast majority of people that live in those countries do not get their food and their water from municipal supplies.
[02:38:58.963 --> 02:39:03.466]  They get their water from streams and rivers, and we can't go out there and put this stuff in every stream and river.
[02:39:03.466 --> 02:39:05.167]  But Mark, here's the big horror.
[02:39:05.167 --> 02:39:06.668]  This is what we know they've done.
[02:39:06.668 --> 02:39:16.573]  I've seen even BBC articles where they check medically the young girls, 10-15 years old, that all have HIV, and they haven't even had
[02:39:18.871 --> 02:39:20.011]  You know, their virginity loss.
[02:39:20.011 --> 02:39:22.392]  They can medically, as you know, check that.
[02:39:22.392 --> 02:39:24.233]  And they're going, we don't know where they got it.
[02:39:24.233 --> 02:39:28.554]  And they go, oh, maybe the aid workers are using the same needles over and over again.
[02:39:28.554 --> 02:39:32.335]  And they've caught them adding sterilization hormones to tetanus shots.
[02:39:32.335 --> 02:39:33.436]  That's mainstream news.
[02:39:33.976 --> 02:39:39.422]  And we hear about Bill and Melinda Gates giving, you know, tens of billions of dollars with Warren Buffett and the rest of them.
[02:39:39.422 --> 02:39:42.065]  And Bill Gates' daddy was the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:39:42.065 --> 02:39:47.011]  And here's the Times of London billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[02:39:47.011 --> 02:39:51.916]  And you've got all the richest people meeting in a, quote, secret meeting of how to reduce the population.
[02:39:52.797 --> 02:39:57.739]  I just want folks to know what's proven and admitted proves these are total criminals.
[02:39:57.739 --> 02:39:59.860]  But I'm telling you, it's a lot bigger.
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:01.201]  But I'm going to try to shut up.
[02:40:01.201 --> 02:40:02.682]  Keep going over the film with the history.
[02:40:02.682 --> 02:40:05.503]  Okay, so you have the abortion, breakup of the black family.
[02:40:05.503 --> 02:40:07.064]  Now they're moved on to everybody, though.
[02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:08.785]  They're not just doing this to blacks.
[02:40:08.785 --> 02:40:11.486]  It's just the blacks are the apple of their eye.
[02:40:11.486 --> 02:40:13.427]  They're the favorite target.
[02:40:13.427 --> 02:40:15.468]  Well, listen, we talked about it in the documentary.
[02:40:15.468 --> 02:40:18.549]  We were able to get our hands on a document that's called NSFM 200.
[02:40:20.094 --> 02:40:37.283]  It was a document that was put out by the United States government, the Justice Department, the CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, and the USAID, which is the agency that operates under the State Department, through which we fund all of these foreign aid programs.
[02:40:37.283 --> 02:40:43.646]  And what that document showed, this document in SSM 200, was originally classified, and I am absolutely convinced
[02:40:44.631 --> 02:40:53.438]  That the Secretary of State's office, which at that time, this document is often called the Kissinger Report because it was put out by Henry Kissinger.
[02:40:53.438 --> 02:41:01.664]  I am convinced they never thought this would be made public because if they thought it was ever going to be made public, they would not have said some of the things that they were saying in here.
[02:41:01.664 --> 02:41:08.569]  But this was a document that was designed to codify or to describe America's
[02:41:09.548 --> 02:41:14.632]  ...policy on controlling the population of what they call underdeveloped or third world countries.
[02:41:14.632 --> 02:41:19.857]  And, not coincidentally, these countries are all in Africa, and they're all black countries.
[02:41:19.857 --> 02:41:28.564]  But, in the document, they state that the reason that we have to control the populations of these countries, we're not doing it to help them.
[02:41:28.564 --> 02:41:37.172]  We're doing it because they have minerals and metals that we need in the United States, and if we don't stabilize and control their populations and reduce their populations,
[02:41:37.952 --> 02:41:41.135]  They'll use up their own minerals and metals and we won't be able to get to them.
[02:41:41.135 --> 02:41:48.021]  And that's a repeat of the British Royal Commission of 49 that says the same thing.
[02:41:48.021 --> 02:41:49.903]  Nothing has changed about this.
[02:41:49.903 --> 02:41:57.810]  Nothing has changed about the eugenics movement since Galton first came up with the idea and his cousin Darwin put wings on it.
[02:41:57.810 --> 02:42:02.955]  I'm telling you, this is a... and people say, well you're some sort of conspiracy nut.
[02:42:02.955 --> 02:42:03.816]  Are you trying to tell me
[02:42:04.952 --> 02:42:17.421]  That a bunch of people in the late 1700s, early 1800s, come up with these fantastic ideas of controlling the world's population, and they're in conspiracy with people that were not even born for a hundred years after that.
[02:42:17.421 --> 02:42:26.528]  It's not a matter, a conspiracy does not have to be a situation where a bunch of people get in a room and cook up some idea that they all work together on.
[02:42:26.528 --> 02:42:29.330]  A conspiracy is what I call the conspiracy of a common agenda.
[02:42:30.982 --> 02:42:31.763]  It's a program.
[02:42:31.763 --> 02:42:33.963]  This is the British Empire, the U.S.
[02:42:33.963 --> 02:42:44.287]  Robber Barons, the Royalty, and the Romans had handbooks on how to throw disease blankets over walls to make everybody die.
[02:42:44.287 --> 02:42:48.269]  The Huns were using that 2,000 years ago.
[02:42:48.269 --> 02:42:49.929]  This is why elites are in control.
[02:42:49.929 --> 02:42:51.550]  They're master planners.
[02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:53.131]  They call themselves great architects.
[02:42:54.571 --> 02:43:00.153]  Are we stupid enough to suggest that Frances Galton got in a room with Margaret Sanger when they never lived contemporaneously?
[02:43:00.153 --> 02:43:01.954]  Obviously we're not stupid enough to say that.
[02:43:01.954 --> 02:43:13.458]  No, the Rockefeller family picked up those ideas and on records went and funded her as a front and then she wrote letters to the big foundations, as you know, saying, I've got to get black fronts because they won't trust us white folks.
[02:43:13.458 --> 02:43:14.639]  Right, exactly.
[02:43:14.639 --> 02:43:17.120]  And that's what they've done up until this very day.
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:20.301]  And now we have gone to the point of exporting this.
[02:43:20.301 --> 02:43:20.821]  Alex, I want to
[02:43:21.361 --> 02:43:29.087]  I want to give you an example of what I believe is the ultimate form of just sheer gall for people to have.
[02:43:29.087 --> 02:43:39.355]  When this idea that we would export genocide into these African countries really took on steam was in the late 60s and early 70s.
[02:43:39.355 --> 02:43:44.019]  At that time, we had a man appointed to head up this effort in the United States.
[02:43:44.019 --> 02:43:44.859]  His name was R.T.
[02:43:44.859 --> 02:43:45.360]  Ravenholt.
[02:43:46.343 --> 02:43:52.828]  And he was appointed by Nixon to run this population control effort outside the country.
[02:43:52.828 --> 02:44:11.200]  They openly stated, and we found the articles and the documents where they openly stated, that the United States' goal with population control was to sterilize one quarter of the world's female population.
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:13.682]  Now you tell me, where do we get the right
[02:44:14.361 --> 02:44:26.365]  And who has the gall to stand up here and say the United States is going to go outside of its borders and sterilize one out of four of the females on this earth?
[02:44:26.365 --> 02:44:28.385]  Where do we get the gall to do that?
[02:44:28.385 --> 02:44:30.026]  And that was just on the paper.
[02:44:30.026 --> 02:44:31.306]  And that was just on paper.
[02:44:31.306 --> 02:44:35.608]  We've got African countries where 45% of the women have HIV.
[02:44:35.608 --> 02:44:39.789]  And Ravenholt, and this was really pushed, not coincidentally in my view,
[02:44:40.990 --> 02:44:54.998]  When the Ford administration, people don't remember this very often, that when you start talking about the Ford administration and Nixon and all that stuff, you forget that Ford's vice president was Nelson Rockefeller.
[02:44:54.998 --> 02:45:02.902]  And Rockefeller, Ford, and Kissinger were pushing all this world population control agenda.
[02:45:02.902 --> 02:45:06.804]  And it's the same group of people.
[02:45:06.804 --> 02:45:08.645]  Every time you investigate something in this,
[02:45:10.262 --> 02:45:17.184]  If you dig deep enough, if you peel enough layers of the onion away, you always find the same people at the center of it.
[02:45:17.184 --> 02:45:22.866]  Well, listen, I've gone online and looked at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and their federal filings.
[02:45:22.866 --> 02:45:28.888]  It's all open eugenics groups, but when you see it on the news, it's, oh, they're helping black people.
[02:45:28.888 --> 02:45:29.988]  Isn't Bill Gates sweet?
[02:45:29.988 --> 02:45:34.890]  But then on Bill Moyers, he said, get rid of the population.
[02:45:34.890 --> 02:45:35.690]  Well, again,
[02:45:37.016 --> 02:45:39.578]  You look at what we've done in foreign countries.
[02:45:39.578 --> 02:45:44.100]  Let me just propose a hypothetical to you.
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:52.064]  Let's say that today in France or England or Germany or Australia or Canada, there was some sort of natural catastrophe.
[02:45:52.064 --> 02:45:55.026]  And these people need help.
[02:45:55.026 --> 02:45:56.927]  Would we help them?
[02:45:56.927 --> 02:45:57.687]  We absolutely would.
[02:45:59.005 --> 02:46:05.348]  But would our help be contingent upon their accepting the American ideals of birth control and abortion?
[02:46:05.348 --> 02:46:19.996]  Would we go into France and say, yeah, we recognize that you got people starving in the streets, and you can't help them, and we're here with USAID, but we've got this food and medicine sitting on this ship out in the harbor.
[02:46:19.996 --> 02:46:21.057]  We will not unload it.
[02:46:21.946 --> 02:46:22.887]  But I'll tell you why, sir.
[02:46:22.887 --> 02:46:23.868]  I'm sure you know this.
[02:46:23.868 --> 02:46:26.129]  The big secret is, and again, you've done a great job.
[02:46:26.129 --> 02:46:26.910]  Your research is amazing.
[02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:27.751]  You've taught me a lot.
[02:46:50.839 --> 02:46:55.245]  This is a sliver just with the blacks, the group they're mainly focused on.
[02:46:55.245 --> 02:47:02.874]  They don't need to in the white countries because they're all run by the eugenicists and they all are pulling the stuff on black, white, it doesn't matter.
[02:47:02.874 --> 02:47:09.783]  And you're right, when they go into Africa or Latin America or Asia, they say, you've got to accept this company running your water supplies.
[02:47:10.163 --> 02:47:12.904]  Because we're going to put additives in it because we care about you.
[02:47:12.904 --> 02:47:17.205]  You've got to accept giving your kids these vaccines because we won't take good care of them.
[02:47:17.205 --> 02:47:21.005]  We're going to kill them down with a hammer, but just never mind what happens if we shoot them up.
[02:47:21.005 --> 02:47:31.468]  So that's the next level of the diabolical evil, is realizing that if they're not giving them aid, the aid they're giving them is eugenics death as well.
[02:47:31.468 --> 02:47:32.228]  Go ahead.
[02:47:32.228 --> 02:47:33.848]  It's cultural suicide.
[02:47:33.848 --> 02:47:37.309]  We're telling these people, unless you're willing to commit cultural suicide, we won't help you.
[02:47:38.015 --> 02:47:46.018]  And, you know, a perfect example of this, and it's just one little tiny grain of sand on the beach, is Haiti.
[02:47:46.018 --> 02:47:48.699]  Haiti, as we all know, has been struck by a lot of disasters.
[02:47:48.699 --> 02:47:50.720]  It's a very poor country.
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.622]  Many of the things that have happened to it are just a result of where it's located on the globe.
[02:47:55.622 --> 02:47:59.684]  They've been hit by hurricanes and tsunamis and all kinds of natural disasters.
[02:48:01.095 --> 02:48:10.339]  We have gone into Haiti repeatedly and told them, you know, we'll help, but you have to accept American birth control and population control measures.
[02:48:10.339 --> 02:48:12.901]  And if you don't do that, we won't help you.
[02:48:12.901 --> 02:48:18.663]  I have talked to people who are missionaries who have gone to Haiti to try to help these poor people.
[02:48:18.663 --> 02:48:20.404]  And they say, you can go into clinics there.
[02:48:20.404 --> 02:48:23.786]  And I had another guy tell me this exact same thing about countries in Africa.
[02:48:23.786 --> 02:48:26.327]  He said, you can go into clinics there.
[02:48:26.327 --> 02:48:30.149]  And in many of these places, a clinic is made up of a thatched
[02:48:30.894 --> 02:48:33.716]  Walled building with no roof and dirt floors.
[02:48:33.716 --> 02:48:34.776]  Alright?
[02:48:34.776 --> 02:48:43.182]  You can go in there, they have no medicines, no bandages, nothing to help deliver a healthy baby, none of that stuff.
[02:48:43.182 --> 02:48:53.888]  But you can look over in the corner and see piles and piles of birth control pills and condoms with American flags and USAID on the ends of them.
[02:48:53.888 --> 02:48:58.071]  In Haiti today, to give you an example of how profound this problem is, in Haiti today,
[02:48:59.156 --> 02:49:07.840]  It's estimated that 90% of the female population in Haiti has access to free birth control supplied by the United States government.
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:12.002]  But only 20% of the Haitian people have access to clean drinking water.
[02:49:13.528 --> 02:49:21.532]  80% of the Haitian people get their water out of sewers and out of open pits and out of streams.
[02:49:21.532 --> 02:49:22.613]  It's all meant to kill them.
[02:49:22.613 --> 02:49:35.380]  Instead of going in, educating them, stabilizing the population, the Royal Commission says we're going to let their populations explode as a way to devastate them economically so we can then come in and mop up later with eugenics.
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:38.442]  I mean, it is just hellish what they're doing.
[02:49:38.442 --> 02:49:38.982]  It is obscene.
[02:49:41.753 --> 02:49:59.766]  It's an obscenity of the first order, and I... You know, the sad thing about this is, is that so much of this is done under the guise of compassion, that, as you mentioned a moment ago, basically the American people look the other way, and they don't understand what is actually going on in these places.
[02:49:59.766 --> 02:50:05.790]  There is no reason for some of these countries in Africa that have large reserves of natural resources
[02:50:06.331 --> 02:50:21.771]  For these countries to be poor year in and year out, for generation in and generation out, a hundred years consistently being poor, there is no reason for that other than that outside forces are manipulating their economies and manipulating their populations.
[02:50:22.162 --> 02:50:25.123]  Well, it's the economic hitmen that John Perkins talks about.
[02:50:25.123 --> 02:50:26.984]  We have the IMF and World Bank documents.
[02:50:26.984 --> 02:50:30.005]  They go in and destroy their economies by design.
[02:50:30.005 --> 02:50:31.085]  And, I mean, look at Haiti.
[02:50:31.085 --> 02:50:34.186]  A bunch of sugar cane slaves, never allowed to have education.
[02:50:34.186 --> 02:50:35.706]  They're hit by hurricanes every year.
[02:50:35.706 --> 02:50:38.447]  There's constant CIA coups.
[02:50:38.447 --> 02:50:39.968]  And, you know, people say, oh, they're just black.
[02:50:39.968 --> 02:50:40.748]  They're not even human.
[02:50:40.748 --> 02:50:42.308]  That's why they live in squalor.
[02:50:42.308 --> 02:50:44.369]  That is such a wicked cop-out.
[02:50:44.369 --> 02:50:48.631]  Meanwhile, the elites are basically putting out rat poison for them to kill their children.
[02:50:50.450 --> 02:50:55.860]  And a lot of racist people think, oh good, this is all being done to whites as well, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:59.006]  We're all under the soft kill eugenics system as well.
[02:50:59.006 --> 02:51:00.850]  Stay there, sir, this is very powerful info.
[02:51:01.584 --> 02:51:04.267]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?

[02:52:53.997 --> 02:52:54.358]  The Bailout Group.
[02:53:02.788 --> 02:53:03.909]  Spring is here.
[02:53:03.909 --> 02:53:04.870]  Growing season.
[02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:07.071]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:53:07.071 --> 02:53:08.772]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:53:08.772 --> 02:53:09.753]  Think about it.
[02:53:09.753 --> 02:53:13.836]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:53:13.836 --> 02:53:17.539]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:53:17.539 --> 02:53:20.361]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[02:53:32.449 --> 02:53:32.910]  I think so.
[02:54:03.823 --> 02:54:10.010]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[02:54:16.054 --> 02:54:26.197]  Just talking to Mark and just amazing information at LifeDynamics.com, Mark Crutcher.
[02:54:26.197 --> 02:54:30.058]  For many years, Mark Crutcher has been an outspoken and uncompromising opponent of abortion.
[02:54:30.058 --> 02:54:36.020]  In 1986, he created the Life Activist Seminar and trained more than 15,000 pro-life activists all across the United States and Canada.
[02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:43.962]  Then in 1992, he founded Life Dynamics, which has since become widely recognized as one of the most innovative and professional pro-life organizations in America.
[02:54:44.582 --> 02:54:54.886]  Under Mark's direction, Life Dynamics has done trailblazing research in the abortion industry and developed an extensive litigation support system to help women sue the abortionists who kill, injure, or sexually assault them.
[02:54:54.886 --> 02:55:01.648]  Since 1992, Life Dynamics has also carried out an aggressive direct mail campaign, and it just goes on from there.
[02:55:01.648 --> 02:55:03.368]  Be sure you go to lifedynamics.com.
[02:55:03.368 --> 02:55:10.111]  And listen, I've figured out how to approach mainline liberals who think, oh, it's a woman's body, keep the state out of their body.
[02:55:10.111 --> 02:55:13.632]  It has nothing to do with that, and when they find out it's about eugenics,
[02:55:14.232 --> 02:55:17.414]  And when they find out how evil it is, they wake up.
[02:55:17.414 --> 02:55:21.996]  And Mark has agreed to stay with us another 15-20 minutes the next hour so we can talk about some other subjects.
[02:55:21.996 --> 02:55:29.420]  Planned Parenthood, the Nazis, the pedophile rings, all the key info that I've separately verified, not just from his research.
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:33.802]  He's a big national leader, so this stuff's well documented, and he's been bringing that out, as he's said, for years.
[02:55:34.818 --> 02:55:41.840]  But you were telling me during the break about Congress seeing this, members of Congress, and this even waking up people.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:51.362]  And I asked, why didn't you put, and maybe you didn't want to get into this because then they'll try to spin it, I said, why didn't you put Obama increasing the abortion funding and eugenics funding in here?
[02:55:51.362 --> 02:55:54.723]  And you explained, I think eloquently, why.
[02:55:54.723 --> 02:55:56.944]  Do you want to get into that or just move on?
[02:55:56.944 --> 02:56:02.385]  Well, no, but I'm happy to talk about the situation that happened in Congress last week.
[02:56:02.385 --> 02:56:03.526]  We had a congressman.
[02:56:04.707 --> 02:56:08.248]  Who had heard about the DVD.
[02:56:08.248 --> 02:56:10.189]  We sent him a copy of it.
[02:56:10.189 --> 02:56:14.331]  He was just blown away by it, as a lot of people are when they see this information.
[02:56:14.331 --> 02:56:19.893]  And he wanted to show it and make it available to members of Congress and their staff to come watch.
[02:56:19.893 --> 02:56:24.434]  So last Thursday, they had a showing for it.
[02:56:24.434 --> 02:56:27.735]  And it was extraordinarily well attended.
[02:56:27.735 --> 02:56:30.717]  The response that we got was amazing.
[02:56:30.717 --> 02:56:31.577]  And they
[02:56:32.651 --> 02:56:41.677]  People were saying, look, there's other people that need to see this, and everybody didn't get to come, so they agreed to show it again the next day on Friday.
[02:56:41.677 --> 02:56:51.964]  On Friday, we had representatives of 19 congressmen who are members of the CBC, or the Congressional Black Caucus, send representatives.
[02:56:51.964 --> 02:56:54.505]  Now, we knew, and people that were there in the little
[02:56:56.397 --> 02:57:11.826]  The reception they had beforehand said it was clear from the attitude these people had that they were hostile, that they knew it had something to do with stopping abortion, and it was being sponsored by a guy who was a Republican and a pro-lifer.
[02:57:11.826 --> 02:57:19.810]  So they were coming there basically as infiltrators to gather information and even be disruptive, possibly.
[02:57:19.810 --> 02:57:21.071]  The anticipation was
[02:57:21.775 --> 02:57:24.757]  That they would eat the food during the reception.
[02:57:24.757 --> 02:57:29.239]  They'd stay for 10 or 15 minutes of the video, get up and leave.
[02:57:29.239 --> 02:57:34.703]  The reality was that at the end of the video, all 19 of them were still there.
[02:57:34.703 --> 02:57:35.563]  They clapped.
[02:57:35.563 --> 02:57:38.345]  Two of the women were crying.
[02:57:38.345 --> 02:57:46.049]  One woman came up to Pastor Johnny Hunter, who's head of LEARN, which is the largest African-American pro-life organization in America.
[02:57:46.049 --> 02:57:48.631]  One of these women came up to him and said, Pastor Hunter, I've got to tell you,
[02:57:49.457 --> 02:57:56.680]  I walked into this room with one view, and she said, I'm leaving with a totally different perspective.
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:57:59.781]  And she said, this thing has changed my life.
[02:57:59.781 --> 02:58:01.702]  And I'm going to go back and talk to my congressman.
[02:58:01.702 --> 02:58:04.103]  Well, praise God, because that's the thing.
[02:58:04.103 --> 02:58:06.684]  This is so over the chart, off the chart.
[02:58:06.684 --> 02:58:14.287]  If we just expose these eugenicists and how the whole society's built by the robber barons, as you said, to carry this out, game over for them.
[02:58:14.287 --> 02:58:15.127]  Absolutely.
[02:58:15.715 --> 02:58:16.835]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.064 --> 02:58:51.207]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.207 --> 02:58:56.430]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:58:56.430 --> 02:59:00.452]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.452 --> 02:59:06.356]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.356 --> 02:59:11.419]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.419 --> 02:59:11.919]  Number three,
[02:59:12.319 --> 02:59:18.622]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:59:18.622 --> 02:59:21.523]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:59:21.523 --> 02:59:26.045]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.045 --> 02:59:29.647]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:29.887 --> 02:59:35.609]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:59:35.609 --> 02:59:40.311]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:59:54.056 --> 02:59:56.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.457 --> 02:59:59.238]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:10.604]  All right, already into the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:10.604 --> 03:00:12.985]  Another two segments with Mark Crutcher.
[03:00:12.985 --> 03:00:13.866]  LifeDynamics.com.
[03:00:13.866 --> 03:00:17.249]  You can get the DVD there or you can get it at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:17.249 --> 03:00:19.250]  We have it discounted.
[03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:25.715]  Endgame discount at half price when you get it with Maafa 21, Black Genocide of the 21st Century.
[03:00:25.715 --> 03:00:28.217]  Show them this one and then show them Endgame.
[03:00:28.217 --> 03:00:30.639]  We're going to play a clip of Endgame coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:32.145 --> 03:00:47.972]  This from newsreel films produced by the robber barons, Rockefeller funding went into this, that were shown to people at free showings and shown to school boards to get the eugenics laws passed to sterilize babies.
[03:00:47.972 --> 03:00:50.454]  And it's on record, they wouldn't just come sterilize a woman.
[03:00:50.454 --> 03:00:52.895]  A lot of times they'd take a baby and put it in a bucket of water.
[03:00:52.895 --> 03:00:55.016]  Same thing the communist Chinese do.
[03:00:55.016 --> 03:00:57.057]  So it's also the murder of babies that are already born.
[03:00:58.403 --> 03:01:00.385]  So this is very, very serious.
[03:01:00.385 --> 03:01:15.718]  We hit that break and you were talking about all these Congressional aides waking up, these pro-abortion people coming in and really figuring out that they've been lied to their whole lives, that this was the genocide of their people, and that they thought of it as some sacred Bill of Rights sacrament.
[03:01:15.718 --> 03:01:20.482]  You're not going to take my abortion rights away, not knowing it was really Hitlerian.
[03:01:20.482 --> 03:01:24.665]  Not knowing that basically what it was designed to do was to wipe out their
[03:01:27.034 --> 03:01:28.215]  Culture.
[03:01:28.215 --> 03:01:29.856]  That's the bottom line.
[03:01:29.856 --> 03:01:39.263]  And, you know, one of the things people think we're baying at the moon here a lot of times when we talk about these, what you guys are calling them, robber barons.
[03:01:39.263 --> 03:01:40.303]  But it's all on record!
[03:01:40.303 --> 03:01:44.046]  I mean, they wrote books themselves!
[03:01:44.046 --> 03:01:48.349]  Let me give you one that, if anybody doubts this, they can go study it themselves.
[03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:50.731]  It's absolutely true.
[03:01:50.731 --> 03:01:52.272]  And they'll find the documentation on it.
[03:01:53.519 --> 03:02:03.784]  At the end of World War II, it was revealed that the company who manufactured the gas for the Nazi death camps was a company named IG Farben.
[03:02:03.784 --> 03:02:22.934]  And it was later found out, when the Allies started researching what had gone on with IG Farben, it was later found out that not only did they manufacture the gas for the Nazis to use in their gas chambers, IG Farben engineers actually designed the gas chambers as a way to induce the Nazis to buy the gas from them.
[03:02:24.108 --> 03:02:32.870]  IG Farben engineers and IG Farben board of directors members were charged and tried at Nuremberg after the war.
[03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:40.332]  Now, IG Farben was a large company in Europe at the time, and they obviously didn't want to go out of business.
[03:02:40.332 --> 03:02:50.274]  So what they did to distance themselves from the Holocaust, which they were being closely linked to, especially when all their board of directors was on trial at Nuremberg, they changed the name of the company.
[03:02:50.274 --> 03:02:52.635]  It became known as Hurt AG.
[03:02:53.846 --> 03:02:54.746]  And they survived.
[03:02:54.746 --> 03:02:55.546]  The company survived.
[03:02:55.546 --> 03:02:57.327]  Not only did it survive, it thrived.
[03:02:57.327 --> 03:03:03.728]  And today, Herct is a gigantic, multinational pharmaceutical and chemical company.
[03:03:03.728 --> 03:03:09.709]  Now, they have subsidiaries all over the world, including the United States.
[03:03:09.709 --> 03:03:12.790]  Their headquarters is in New Jersey.
[03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:17.831]  In France, their subsidiary is a company called Roussol-U-Cloff.
[03:03:17.831 --> 03:03:22.792]  Roussol-U-Cloff is the company that developed RU-46, the abortion pill.
[03:03:22.792 --> 03:03:23.572]  So, in other words,
[03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:35.472]  The same company, IG Farben, which manufactured the gas for the Nazi death camps, also developed RU-486 to use in American death camps.
[03:03:35.472 --> 03:03:38.233]  Killing is our business, and business is good.
[03:03:38.233 --> 03:03:42.054]  And here's something that's very interesting about this.
[03:03:42.054 --> 03:03:47.815]  It was also revealed in congressional hearings after the war that the Rockefeller Foundation
[03:03:48.772 --> 03:03:51.114]  was a business partner with IG Farben.
[03:03:51.114 --> 03:04:00.103]  They even went together and formed another company called Standard IG Farben for Standard Oil, which was an American company under Rockefeller, and IG Farben.
[03:04:00.103 --> 03:04:05.548]  They were actually business partners, and that partnership even continued after the war began.
[03:04:05.548 --> 03:04:13.475]  So, you had IG Farben and Rockefeller in bed together to come up with the Zyklon B gas that was used in the Nazi death camps,
[03:04:14.346 --> 03:04:22.147]  Later on, IG Farben is developing RU-46 under the name of Roussel Ucloff in France.
[03:04:22.147 --> 03:04:23.330]  Another Rockefeller connection!
[03:04:24.795 --> 03:04:35.902]  When RU46 was rushed through the approval process by the Clinton administration, they couldn't find a manufacturer to manufacture RU46.
[03:04:35.902 --> 03:04:38.343]  Because it kills a lot of people that take it.
[03:04:38.343 --> 03:04:38.763]  Stay there.
[03:04:38.763 --> 03:04:39.884]  Final segment with our guests.
[03:04:39.884 --> 03:04:42.085]  We've got to have them back on a routine basis.
[03:04:42.085 --> 03:04:43.806]  Final segment coming up.
[03:04:43.806 --> 03:04:46.688]  Maafa, 21, black genocide in 21st century America.
[03:04:49.691 --> 03:04:51.993]  A slice of the evil, but a big slice.
[03:04:51.993 --> 03:04:52.954]  You need to see it.
[03:04:52.954 --> 03:04:54.616]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:54.616 --> 03:04:57.118]  Folks, I expect to see these go out the door.
[03:04:57.118 --> 03:05:00.362]  I want you to have viewing showings, viewing parties.
[03:05:00.362 --> 03:05:01.022]  Get this out there.
[03:05:01.022 --> 03:05:02.264]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.264 --> 03:05:04.266]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:05:04.266 --> 03:05:05.247]  Well, you should.
[03:05:05.247 --> 03:05:09.731]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:05:09.731 --> 03:05:10.192]  That's right.
[03:05:10.532 --> 03:05:20.538]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:05:20.538 --> 03:05:25.941]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol.
[03:05:26.181 --> 03:05:34.767]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:05:34.767 --> 03:05:40.291]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:05:40.291 --> 03:05:41.772]  This is real.
[03:05:41.772 --> 03:05:42.813]  Don't miss out.
[03:05:42.813 --> 03:05:51.378]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[03:05:53.740 --> 03:05:57.443]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[03:05:57.443 --> 03:06:01.147]  Go to FrontSite.com for your training and free gun.
[03:06:01.147 --> 03:06:01.767]  Hello, friends.
[03:06:01.767 --> 03:06:02.848]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.848 --> 03:06:07.592]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:06:07.592 --> 03:06:10.535]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:06:10.535 --> 03:06:13.598]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:06:13.598 --> 03:06:18.302]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:06:18.522 --> 03:06:19.663]  If you simply prepare.
[03:06:19.663 --> 03:06:22.907]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:06:22.907 --> 03:06:29.895]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[03:06:29.895 --> 03:06:33.179]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:06:33.179 --> 03:06:33.439]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:35.842 --> 03:06:38.303]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:06:38.303 --> 03:06:44.567]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:06:44.567 --> 03:06:48.349]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:49.610]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:50.330]  Take action today.
[03:06:50.330 --> 03:06:52.151]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:07:01.687 --> 03:07:05.208]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.208 --> 03:07:10.609]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.609 --> 03:07:15.570]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:15.570 --> 03:07:26.552]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:07:26.832 --> 03:07:32.579]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:32.579 --> 03:07:38.827]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:38.827 --> 03:07:39.688]  What about you?
[03:07:39.688 --> 03:07:41.611]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[03:07:41.611 --> 03:07:44.294]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:07:48.157 --> 03:07:48.538]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[03:07:51.119 --> 03:07:52.320]  That's DirectiveTheNumber21.com now.
[03:07:52.320 --> 03:07:55.561]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.473 --> 03:08:19.054]  It is on record that Margaret Singer gave awards to Hitler and got awards from him.
[03:08:19.054 --> 03:08:22.595]  It is on record she called blacks sub-human weeds that had to be exterminated.
[03:08:22.595 --> 03:08:26.717]  We have to hire blacks to be our front so they don't know we want to kill them.
[03:08:26.717 --> 03:08:29.957]  It is on record all of this goes on.
[03:08:29.957 --> 03:08:31.598]  So, don't be in denial.
[03:08:32.742 --> 03:08:45.809]  About what set up abortion, what runs it, what's happening in this country and the world, and the carbon tax, and that we're carbon-based life form, that we need to be taxed for having more than one child, and need to be regulated, and be licensed to have kids.
[03:08:45.809 --> 03:08:47.610]  This is the eugenics takeover.
[03:08:47.610 --> 03:08:49.411]  And after our guest leaves us, I'm going to get more into that.
[03:08:49.411 --> 03:08:53.533]  But I wanted to play a clip from Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:08:53.533 --> 03:08:55.074]  This is from the movie.
[03:08:56.304 --> 03:09:22.074]  uh... put out in the thirties promoting this stuff and then and then a bunch of newsreels that promoted it uh... and you know as bad as this movie as it's seen as though she's really innocent she doesn't need to be sterilized as she was adopted but it's still all the retards need to be you know sterilized or people that have mental problems need to be your physical problems but she's innocent so
[03:09:23.365 --> 03:09:29.209]  They put it in the situational ethics where it's she's innocent but the others still deserve it.
[03:09:29.209 --> 03:09:30.330]  Here it is.
[03:09:30.330 --> 03:09:41.037]  The scientific rationale for tyranny has always been attractive to elites because it creates a convenient excuse for treating their fellow man as lower than animals.
[03:09:42.503 --> 03:09:49.707]  Robert Thomas Malthus, famous for saying that a mass food collapse would be helpful because it would wipe out the poor.
[03:09:49.707 --> 03:09:55.231]  His fictional scenario would later be called a Malthusian Catastrophe.
[03:09:55.231 --> 03:10:05.397]  Malthus is important because his ideas led to the rise of a new scientific field that would dominate the course of human history for the next 200 plus years.
[03:10:08.007 --> 03:10:17.564]  Charles Darwin, an admirer of the Malthusian catastrophe model, developed the theory of evolution, its chief tenet being the survival of the fittest.
[03:10:18.459 --> 03:10:19.500]  With the help of T.H.
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:31.807]  Huxley, known as Darwin's bulldog for his strong support of Darwin's theories, Darwin's theories were pushed into wide acceptance among key scientific circles throughout England, and then the world.
[03:10:31.807 --> 03:10:45.316]  Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, credited as the father of eugenics, saw an opportunity to advance mankind by taking the reins of Darwin's evolution theory and applied social principles to develop social Darwinism.
[03:10:46.036 --> 03:10:59.024]  The families Darwin, Galton, Huxley and Wedgwood were so obsessed with their new social design theory that they pledged their families would only breed with each other.
[03:10:59.024 --> 03:11:07.549]  They falsely predicted that within only a few generations they would produce supermen.
[03:11:07.549 --> 03:11:14.493]  The emerging pseudoscience was only codifying the practice of inbreeding already popular within elites for millennia.
[03:11:16.297 --> 03:11:19.439]  The Four Families Experiment was a disaster.
[03:11:19.439 --> 03:11:29.967]  Within only two generations of inbreeding, close to 90% of their offspring either died at birth or were seriously mentally or physically handicapped.
[03:11:29.967 --> 03:11:42.997]  The moneyed class of the planet, and particularly the royal families of the world, who were already obsessed with breeding and filled with a predatory disdain for the underclass, seized on the new science and began aggressively enforcing its aims worldwide.
[03:11:49.485 --> 03:12:04.031]  Biometrics appears to be a new science, but it was actually developed by Galton back in the 1870s as a way to track racial traits and genetic histories, and as a way to decide who would be licensed to breed.
[03:12:04.031 --> 03:12:14.595]  In 1904, the Cold Springs Harbor Research Facility was started in the United States by eugenicist Charles Davenport with the funding of prominent robber barons Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Harriman.
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:22.124]  In 1907, the first sterilization laws were passed in the United States.
[03:12:22.124 --> 03:12:29.970]  Citizens with mild deformities or low test scores on their report cards were arrested and forcibly sterilized.
[03:12:29.970 --> 03:12:32.292]  You're 17, aren't you, Alice?
[03:12:32.292 --> 03:12:34.734]  Yes, but what have you done with my folks?
[03:12:34.734 --> 03:12:37.656]  Well, we're trying to help them, Alice, and you too.
[03:12:37.656 --> 03:12:39.758]  They were taken to the hospital this afternoon.
[03:12:39.758 --> 03:12:40.659]  Hospital?
[03:12:40.659 --> 03:12:42.540]  Wasn't none of them sick this morning?
[03:12:42.540 --> 03:12:46.804]  We thought it necessary to present your family's case to the state medical commission.
[03:12:47.595 --> 03:12:52.496]  After an examination, they decided there was but one important action to take.
[03:12:52.496 --> 03:12:55.817]  To have your entire family sterilized.
[03:12:55.817 --> 03:12:57.057]  Why, what's that?
[03:12:57.057 --> 03:12:58.358]  I don't know what you're talking about!
[03:12:58.358 --> 03:13:05.480]  Now, in this state, we have a law which provides for such people to have an operation so there won't be any more children.
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:06.740]  I see.
[03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:10.941]  Now, we've placed your brothers in institutions where they'll be properly cared for.
[03:13:10.941 --> 03:13:14.322]  But if you go back to your job, Sue, I'll arrange to have it held open for you.
[03:13:15.544 --> 03:13:16.544]  I'm keeping my job.
[03:13:16.544 --> 03:13:18.305]  I'm not going anywhere.
[03:13:18.305 --> 03:13:20.725]  Now you're going to the hospital too, Alex.
[03:13:20.725 --> 03:13:25.026]  And you mean they're going to stop me from having children ever?
[03:13:25.026 --> 03:13:26.767]  Exactly.
[03:13:26.767 --> 03:13:27.707]  I'm all right, I tell you.
[03:13:27.707 --> 03:13:29.127]  I won't go to any hospital.
[03:13:29.127 --> 03:13:31.208]  We don't want any trouble with you, young woman.
[03:13:31.208 --> 03:13:35.709]  If you refuse to go, the officer here will take you by force.
[03:13:35.709 --> 03:13:36.769]  In 1910, the U.S.
[03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:38.590]  Eugenics Record Office was set up.
[03:13:38.590 --> 03:13:39.410]  All right, that's enough.
[03:13:39.410 --> 03:13:44.091]  Then the British had created... And they take her to trial and decide to go ahead and sterilize her, and it's good.
[03:13:46.587 --> 03:13:49.710]  Going back to Mark Crutcher, this is our history.
[03:13:49.710 --> 03:13:51.813]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[03:13:51.813 --> 03:13:54.876]  Christ said the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:13:54.876 --> 03:13:56.057]  The truth will set you free.
[03:13:56.057 --> 03:13:59.020]  I mean, it really is true.
[03:13:59.020 --> 03:14:03.805]  And so finish up with the eugenics in the film, Maafa, 21.
[03:14:05.734 --> 03:14:20.367]  But then get into, and of course we'll have you back, I know your time is very important, sir, to get into the other crimes of Planned Parenthood, because it's not just their sicko eugenicists, the eugenicists hire sickos who like to engage in crimes against children as kind of their payoff.
[03:14:21.067 --> 03:14:23.688]  Yeah, what you have to understand is that these people honestly believe
[03:14:51.536 --> 03:14:55.038]  That they are genetically superior to everyone else on the planet.
[03:14:55.038 --> 03:15:01.843]  It's not that they do this out of hoping that they're genetically superior.
[03:15:01.843 --> 03:15:03.344]  They honestly believe it.
[03:15:03.344 --> 03:15:14.711]  And so, in their kind of twisted worldview, I don't think many times they even realize how patently evil they are.
[03:15:14.711 --> 03:15:17.053]  You know, if a guy is going out here and he's committing
[03:15:18.047 --> 03:15:21.868]  Uh, rapes on the street, or murders, or robbing places.
[03:15:21.868 --> 03:15:28.450]  If you stop him, if you go to the prison, if you go down to Huntsville, and you ask these people, is what you did wrong, is what you did evil?
[03:15:28.450 --> 03:15:30.451]  Most of them will tell you, yeah, they knew it.
[03:15:30.451 --> 03:15:32.912]  They knew it when they were doing it, that it was wrong.
[03:15:32.912 --> 03:15:43.175]  But the most dangerous part of these eugenics, this eugenics crowd, and this white elite that we have seen around the world over the last 150 years, is they honestly believe this stuff.
[03:15:43.175 --> 03:15:44.636]  They're true believers.
[03:15:44.636 --> 03:15:45.616]  Satan has his
[03:15:46.758 --> 03:15:47.318]  We're good to go.
[03:16:10.766 --> 03:16:18.555]  Uh, philosophy that, yeah, it'd probably be best if the whole world lived by this stuff, but it's not really realistic, and that's not the goal we have to shoot for.
[03:16:18.555 --> 03:16:25.062]  And we're morally and intellectually superior in every way to these people, so it's our right to have dominion over them.
[03:16:26.411 --> 03:16:29.692]  That's right, they say it's illegal in their system for you to resist them.
[03:16:29.692 --> 03:16:31.193]  You're like, well, I have a right to live.
[03:16:31.193 --> 03:16:36.315]  I have a right to not have sodium fluoride put in my water and tell me I've got to shoot my kids up with mercury that gives them cancer.
[03:16:36.315 --> 03:16:39.636]  And they just go, you aren't intellectual enough to understand that.
[03:16:39.636 --> 03:16:45.598]  I've had one of them on the air say, we're going to take over the planet, Alex, and we're going to forcibly re-educate you.
[03:16:45.598 --> 03:16:47.639]  And to them, I go, but that's tyranny.
[03:16:47.639 --> 03:16:50.120]  No, I'm intellectually more advanced than you.
[03:16:52.788 --> 03:16:58.990]  You just psychologically, mentally, can't even measure up to me, so you don't get to make that decision.
[03:16:58.990 --> 03:17:07.772]  Well, it's a part of the arrogance and the gall that I talked about earlier when they say that we have the right, as the U.S.
[03:17:07.772 --> 03:17:17.135]  government has the right, or actually their argument was the responsibility, to go out and sterilize one-fourth of the world's female population.
[03:17:17.135 --> 03:17:20.096]  They believe that they are kind of the chosen people
[03:17:20.925 --> 03:17:24.949]  And if the rest of us were simply as smart as they are, we would agree with them.
[03:17:24.949 --> 03:17:30.275]  In other words, you cannot be intelligent and reach a different conclusion than what they reach.
[03:17:30.275 --> 03:17:34.800]  And this is classic neoliberalism in the 20th century in America.
[03:17:35.031 --> 03:17:37.592]  Yeah, and they say they're very sad about it.
[03:17:37.592 --> 03:17:43.174]  Oh, I don't like that we have to shoot the young women up with HIV, but my God, they're going to destroy the Earth if we don't.
[03:17:43.174 --> 03:17:45.114]  Well, then how about they go kill themselves?
[03:17:45.114 --> 03:17:46.355]  Oh, but no.
[03:17:46.355 --> 03:17:46.795]  No, no, no.
[03:17:46.795 --> 03:17:48.155]  They're the brain trust.
[03:17:48.155 --> 03:17:49.856]  They've got to survive.
[03:17:49.856 --> 03:17:50.476]  This is just...
[03:17:51.056 --> 03:17:52.597]  Classic extermination.
[03:17:52.597 --> 03:17:56.778]  This is just an instinct of a control freak to dominate everybody around them.
[03:17:56.778 --> 03:17:58.118]  And I've talked to these people.
[03:17:58.118 --> 03:17:59.959]  At the bottom line, they get off on it.
[03:17:59.959 --> 03:18:01.199]  They get off on it.
[03:18:01.199 --> 03:18:02.680]  They're not trying to educate people.
[03:18:02.680 --> 03:18:05.901]  They're not trying to... No, they want to dominate and control.
[03:18:05.901 --> 03:18:08.321]  And what I found, sir, is you're going off their own documents.
[03:18:08.321 --> 03:18:12.843]  What we cover in Endgame is they don't just have positive and negative eugenics, as they claim.
[03:18:12.843 --> 03:18:17.244]  That is making the great race greater and live longer and better looking and smarter.
[03:18:17.244 --> 03:18:19.885]  And let's stop the dummies from breeding.
[03:18:21.235 --> 03:18:21.755]  It's worse.
[03:18:21.755 --> 03:18:29.682]  When you really get into higher-level eugenics, they're targeting the smart and the intelligent that they think rival them in the power structure.
[03:18:29.682 --> 03:18:45.334]  So really, while they're diverting kind of low-level racists that serve them, that, oh, this is just for blacks and Mexicans and Asians and people, while they're diverting them, when you get into higher-level text on eugenics and the real operational system that I've studied, just from the intelligence on the ground of what they're doing,
[03:18:45.914 --> 03:19:02.944]  Their real target is actually who they believe the elite, most smart people are, and that's Northern Europeans and Jews, because they think those are the groups that are real smart, but they want their elite families to stay in control, so they want to exterminate out those groups because they see them as rivals.
[03:19:02.944 --> 03:19:07.426]  Kind of like a male grizzly bear will come up and smell cubs and kill the males.
[03:19:07.426 --> 03:19:08.767]  Tigers, lions do that.
[03:19:09.487 --> 03:19:15.110]  Some species of birds go and kill male baby birds because they think they're going to be competing with them lately.
[03:19:15.110 --> 03:19:16.750]  That's actually what they're doing.
[03:19:16.750 --> 03:19:20.732]  So for all the racists out there, they're putting stuff in your water too.
[03:19:20.732 --> 03:19:31.697]  Well, it's not what you're describing there is not unlike, if you think about it Alex, what always happened in countries that were taken over through communist uprisings.
[03:19:31.697 --> 03:19:37.419]  One of the things that the communists always did when they took over a country was execute all the people that helped them take over.
[03:19:38.214 --> 03:19:42.938]  Because they would see them as potential threats and potential rivals in the future.
[03:19:42.938 --> 03:19:43.878]  Oh, that's a great point.
[03:19:43.878 --> 03:19:44.619]  Final segment.
[03:19:44.619 --> 03:19:46.700]  Sorry, we're having these breaks.
[03:19:46.700 --> 03:19:49.462]  It's just amazing having Mark Crutcher on.
[03:19:49.462 --> 03:19:50.703]  Lifedynamics.com.
[03:19:50.703 --> 03:19:53.946]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[03:19:53.946 --> 03:19:58.429]  Just incredible resource out there and really standing up for these unborn defenseless babies.
[03:20:01.704 --> 03:20:03.005]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:03.005 --> 03:20:08.588]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.588 --> 03:20:13.610]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.610 --> 03:20:19.193]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:20:19.193 --> 03:20:23.876]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.397 --> 03:20:31.521]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.521 --> 03:20:32.641]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.641 --> 03:20:39.325]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.325 --> 03:20:42.507]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[03:22:01.553 --> 03:22:02.974]  It is a big idea.
[03:22:02.974 --> 03:22:05.796]  A New World Order.
[03:22:05.796 --> 03:22:10.679]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:22:10.679 --> 03:22:13.521]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:22:13.521 --> 03:22:16.303]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:22:16.303 --> 03:22:19.486]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:22:19.486 --> 03:22:26.811]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:22:29.827 --> 03:22:34.764]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:22:35.270 --> 03:22:39.131]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:22:39.131 --> 03:22:41.712]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:22:41.712 --> 03:22:42.872]  Most people have no idea.
[03:22:42.872 --> 03:22:43.652]  They're not after money.
[03:22:43.652 --> 03:22:44.933]  They have all the money they need.
[03:22:44.933 --> 03:22:45.913]  They're after power.
[03:22:45.913 --> 03:22:47.053]  That's what they're after these days.
[03:22:47.053 --> 03:22:51.815]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:22:55.776 --> 03:22:56.536]  Endgame.
[03:22:56.536 --> 03:22:58.577]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:22:58.577 --> 03:22:59.737]  You have been warned.
[03:23:00.484 --> 03:23:07.690]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:23:07.690 --> 03:23:12.253]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:23:12.253 --> 03:23:17.877]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:23:17.877 --> 03:23:25.403]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:23:25.403 --> 03:23:30.307]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:23:30.767 --> 03:23:36.628]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:23:36.628 --> 03:23:42.410]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[03:23:42.410 --> 03:23:48.371]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.

[03:24:06.636 --> 03:24:06.817]  Hey!
[03:24:28.544 --> 03:24:33.027]  The film, Maafa, 21, Black Genocide in 21st Century America.
[03:24:33.027 --> 03:24:35.529]  You gotta get it at infoawards.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:24:35.529 --> 03:24:35.789]  888-253-3139.
[03:24:35.789 --> 03:24:37.830]  You can also write to me.
[03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:41.633]  I'm Alex Jones in Austin, Texas at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 787-04.
[03:24:41.633 --> 03:24:42.653]  Don't count on other people.
[03:24:54.076 --> 03:24:56.178]  To expose this, you need to.
[03:24:56.178 --> 03:24:57.780]  Again, abortion's being exposed.
[03:24:57.780 --> 03:25:01.904]  They're still killing millions of babies every year, but the numbers are going down.
[03:25:01.904 --> 03:25:04.707]  The polls show people are waking up to this.
[03:25:04.707 --> 03:25:12.255]  And so the establishment's using the phony green revolution now as the pretext to put in this world tax to control us that we cover in the endgame.
[03:25:12.255 --> 03:25:15.598]  Okay, Mark, finishing up, we'll have you back up for a part two on this.
[03:25:15.598 --> 03:25:16.839]  You've been gracious with your time.
[03:25:17.740 --> 03:25:25.826]  Get more into Planned Parenthood and just some of the other disgusting things they're involved with on record that you have documented at LifeDynamics.com.
[03:25:25.826 --> 03:25:38.794]  Well, like I say, I would like to come back sometime and talk about these other things, because they're a show all in and of themselves, and that is the pedophile protection racket and this issue of marketing the body parts of the babies that they kill.
[03:25:38.794 --> 03:25:42.877]  There's more money in the marketing of the body parts than there is in the actual abortion.
[03:25:42.877 --> 03:25:45.579]  I would not be surprised if someday in the future
[03:25:46.468 --> 03:25:52.972]  That you don't see free abortion clinics in order to just acquire the bodies.
[03:25:52.972 --> 03:25:54.153]  They could right now do that.
[03:25:54.153 --> 03:25:55.954]  That would not be a problem.
[03:25:55.954 --> 03:26:07.242]  And when we were doing our undercover investigation, that was something that we heard discussed, that they might actually put free abortion clinics out here just to get the dead bodies.
[03:26:07.242 --> 03:26:11.385]  Because, you know, they could do an abortion for $300 or $400, charge the woman $300 or $400, but they get a body that they can sell for $2,000.
[03:26:15.290 --> 03:26:17.331]  Well, they could get more bodies if they didn't charge anything.
[03:26:17.331 --> 03:26:18.572]  Well, that's how the scam works.
[03:26:18.572 --> 03:26:28.418]  They take toxic waste from aluminum production and fertilizer, and then the city of Austin pays millions a year to put the poison in our water, when that company would have to pay to get rid of it.
[03:26:28.418 --> 03:26:40.785]  This is the same kind of scam, but they should be paying for the babies as much as they get for them, and China, we've confirmed, they got in the brochures, they admittedly render the babies down and put it into cosmetics.
[03:26:40.785 --> 03:26:41.045]  Right.
[03:26:41.045 --> 03:26:44.507]  Well, I don't think, really, Alex, we have any
[03:26:45.140 --> 03:26:53.004]  Any inkling of an idea, even those of us who work in this every day, any inkling of an idea of how deep this thing goes.
[03:26:53.004 --> 03:26:58.866]  But one point I want to make before we leave, because I don't want people to get the wrong idea about something here.
[03:26:58.866 --> 03:27:02.748]  This is not about political parties.
[03:27:02.748 --> 03:27:08.611]  It's very often that you hear people say, yeah, we've got to stop those evil Democrats and we've got to help the Republicans.
[03:27:08.611 --> 03:27:09.351]  Let me tell you something.
[03:27:09.929 --> 03:27:25.903]  Whether you're talking about the godless social engineers that dominate the Democratic Party, or the godless elitists who dominate the Republican Party, they've both been mobbed up in the eugenics business for way over a hundred years.
[03:27:25.903 --> 03:27:36.993]  And this is something that we need to make sure people understand, that we're not out here proselytizing for the Republican Party, or criticizing the Democratic Party, because as we show in this documentary,
[03:27:37.717 --> 03:27:40.520]  They've both been up to their eyeballs.
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:41.421]  Exactly.
[03:27:41.421 --> 03:27:47.087]  Because if you just make it left-right, then the system can play it off against us, when really it's system-wide.
[03:27:47.087 --> 03:27:48.709]  Like you said, mobbed up.
[03:27:48.709 --> 03:27:50.671]  This is a mob, a cult.
[03:27:50.671 --> 03:27:52.332]  This is really, their religion is...
[03:27:54.181 --> 03:27:59.705]  I mean, I've discovered that IBM and Microsoft are basically eugenics fronts.
[03:27:59.705 --> 03:28:00.405]  Right.
[03:28:00.405 --> 03:28:02.346]  I mean, it just goes so deep.
[03:28:02.346 --> 03:28:09.571]  Well, you know, a minute ago I was mentioning that Rockefeller was involved in the production of what was IG Farben.
[03:28:09.571 --> 03:28:22.920]  And then we were talking about RU46, and we got interrupted there by the commercial, but when they couldn't find a manufacturer for RU46 in the United States, they spent eight years looking for someone to actually sell it here, eventually
[03:28:23.664 --> 03:28:44.283]  A Chinese company, a pharmaceutical company owned by the Chinese government, agreed to manufacture RNA-46 for the American market, and they admitted in the press release that they made, when they announced that they were going to do this, they admitted that they only did it because their research was being underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:28:44.730 --> 03:28:45.830]  I saw that in the news.
[03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:46.370]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:46.370 --> 03:28:53.072]  So, the Rockefellers, by way of the CHICOM government, are killing American babies, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[03:28:53.072 --> 03:28:54.893]  I mean, just outrageous.
[03:28:54.893 --> 03:28:58.553]  But the majority, what are the numbers per capita?
[03:28:58.553 --> 03:29:02.074]  I mean, it's a huge higher level of black babies are aborted, right?
[03:29:02.074 --> 03:29:08.776]  Right in America today, a black baby is over five times as likely to be aborted as a white baby.
[03:29:09.329 --> 03:29:16.292]  American women are 12% black, yet black women make up 37% of the abortions.
[03:29:16.292 --> 03:29:19.793]  More black babies... Now, I want you to hear this, okay?
[03:29:19.793 --> 03:29:31.157]  Alex, more African Americans are murdered every week in American abortion clinics than all the African Americans that died in the seven years of the Vietnam War.
[03:29:31.157 --> 03:29:31.537]  Every week.
[03:29:32.279 --> 03:29:33.140]  Unbelievable.
[03:29:33.140 --> 03:29:35.842]  LifeDynamics.com, Mark Crutcher.

[03:29:41.106 --> 03:29:41.566]  Thank you.
[03:29:41.566 --> 03:29:42.047]  Take care.
[03:29:42.047 --> 03:29:44.068]  I'll say bye to you during the break, if you can hold a moment.

[03:31:06.969 --> 03:31:08.271]  InnerHealth Botanicals.
[03:31:08.271 --> 03:31:12.537]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[03:31:12.537 --> 03:31:14.399]  My wife just loves the stuff.

[03:31:49.747 --> 03:31:50.267]  Aerial spring.
[03:31:50.267 --> 03:31:51.327]  Chemtrails.
[03:31:51.327 --> 03:31:52.928]  The modified atmosphere.
[03:31:52.928 --> 03:31:55.388]  Heavy metals and pesticides.
[03:31:55.388 --> 03:31:58.408]  Carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:32:19.781 --> 03:32:22.842]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[03:32:22.842 --> 03:32:30.044]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:32:30.044 --> 03:32:37.266]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.

[03:32:41.148 --> 03:32:42.408]  Cleaning out heavy metals
[03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:44.350]  We're good to go.
[03:33:24.292 --> 03:33:29.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, the ball games don't matter as much anymore, do they?
[03:33:29.295 --> 03:33:35.318]  The acting cool around your neighbors, the worrying about your hair falling out, the women worrying about their fat.
[03:33:35.318 --> 03:33:37.880]  I mean, get your head screwed on straight.
[03:33:37.880 --> 03:33:43.103]  The robber barons publicly wrote hundreds of books, congressional studies, laws.
[03:33:43.103 --> 03:33:50.527]  The social workers, the health departments, the taking your blood at birth for 36 years illegally, now admitted mainstream news.
[03:33:50.527 --> 03:33:51.688]  It's all part of eugenics.
[03:33:53.086 --> 03:34:06.871]  And the church committee brought a lot of this out as well, not just about the CIA and of course it came out in the 90s about Henry Kissinger and State Department memorandum 200.
[03:34:06.871 --> 03:34:13.714]  But the issue here is we're all living under eugenics.
[03:34:13.714 --> 03:34:19.856]  And this whole phony green revolution and the feds federalizing all the water and the national animal ID and shutting down
[03:34:21.308 --> 03:34:23.750]  The family farms and ranches, and that's what this is doing.
[03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:26.531]  This is all about population control.
[03:34:26.531 --> 03:34:38.279]  Every time we get the minutes, or every time we have a spa, or every time one of the cleaning ladies steals documents out of a trash can for us, it's the same thing.
[03:34:38.279 --> 03:34:43.062]  They're, how do we get our world government so we can kill the majority of these people?
[03:34:43.062 --> 03:34:44.263]  That's what they talk about.
[03:34:44.263 --> 03:34:45.324]  That's why they want the power.
[03:34:45.324 --> 03:34:46.525]  It's the ultimate control freak.
[03:34:47.338 --> 03:35:08.033]  And you know, we talk to these hotel workers and people at Bilderberg year after year and we say, the investigators, Jim Tucker and others, I've done it myself, you get there and you say, look, we want you to get us the minutes of the meeting, we want you to spy on them, we want you to meet with us and tell us what you heard them say.
[03:35:08.033 --> 03:35:10.795]  And they say, no, we've been told we're all fired if we do that.
[03:35:10.795 --> 03:35:12.937]  And I go, alright, here's my card, here's my number.
[03:35:14.602 --> 03:35:16.263]  Here's our info.
[03:35:16.263 --> 03:35:23.388]  And when they actually hear the evil, they always come back and say, absolutely, we gotta stop these people.
[03:35:23.388 --> 03:35:29.592]  See, folks, you can't be in the secret meeting.
[03:35:29.592 --> 03:35:32.634]  But you can go cover it.
[03:35:32.634 --> 03:35:37.057]  You can go hear it from the maids, from the cleaning people, you can get the documents, you can infiltrate.
[03:35:38.089 --> 03:35:47.214]  But now they don't even, they're trying to take the bang out of our announcements by just coming right out and going, well of course we want to get rid of the majority of the people, it's for the Earth!
[03:35:47.214 --> 03:35:56.940]  You know, every nature show is about how humans are bad and polar bears can't swim and seals can't swim, we gotta get rid of humans or the seals will drown.
[03:35:56.940 --> 03:36:04.344]  You know, just, just, just, I'm joking about seals can't swim, they say polar bears can't swim, it's as ridiculous as saying fish can't swim.
[03:36:05.782 --> 03:36:10.724]  And that, you know, they're melting and dying and that there's no ice caps when the ice caps are getting bigger.
[03:36:10.724 --> 03:36:16.846]  I mean, it's just lies on top of lies on top of lies.
[03:36:16.846 --> 03:36:23.508]  And Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation and a world government to carry it out.
[03:36:23.508 --> 03:36:26.469]  And how they're, it's called the good group.
[03:36:26.469 --> 03:36:33.691]  With all these top Rockefeller family members and Ted Turner and Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett and
[03:36:34.918 --> 03:36:37.440]  Oprah Winfrey, I mean all of these people.
[03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:52.649]  It is so disgusting to see all of this going on and all of this happening and just wanting people to read it for themselves.
[03:36:52.649 --> 03:37:02.475]  Just wanting people to find out what's going on for themselves because this is all real, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:02.475 --> 03:37:02.816]  All right.
[03:37:05.299 --> 03:37:14.142]  You know, I want to take a few calls, specifically in the limited time we have, specifically on that last interview you heard about eugenics.
[03:37:14.142 --> 03:37:18.523]  I mean, how can any of you listen to us and send me emails saying I'm making this up?
[03:37:18.523 --> 03:37:20.144]  Number one, I'm not lying.
[03:37:20.144 --> 03:37:23.825]  They would sue me if this stuff wasn't true.
[03:37:23.825 --> 03:37:29.367]  But number two, if there's a 10% chance of what I'm saying being true, you better look into it, buddy.
[03:37:32.133 --> 03:37:33.693]  It's on record!
[03:37:33.693 --> 03:37:38.754]  I give this example because it's been on CNN, MSNBC, and came out in court.
[03:37:38.754 --> 03:37:55.658]  The documents got released at Bayer Pharmaceutical, knowingly, over 10 years, shipped out over a million ampoules of Factor A, knowing every person that got it was going to be killed by it, by HIV and Hepatitis.
[03:37:55.658 --> 03:37:58.158]  It wasn't like they just cold-bloodedly said, I'll murder these people.
[03:37:58.158 --> 03:38:00.079]  It was for eugenics.
[03:38:00.079 --> 03:38:01.199]  It wasn't for profit.
[03:38:02.625 --> 03:38:07.849]  They take incredible risk putting drugs out that kill you because they want to kill you.
[03:38:07.849 --> 03:38:10.751]  This is their religion.
[03:38:10.751 --> 03:38:12.792]  And I know that's wild.
[03:38:12.792 --> 03:38:14.533]  I know it's crazy.
[03:38:14.533 --> 03:38:17.115]  I don't believe it.
[03:38:17.115 --> 03:38:18.476]  I don't believe in their system.
[03:38:18.476 --> 03:38:19.857]  I'm not the crazy one.
[03:38:19.857 --> 03:38:24.060]  I'm the one that looks at them saying it and doing it and says, we got to do something about this.
[03:38:31.192 --> 03:38:36.957]  And I'm so sick of people in this closed left-right paradigm.
[03:38:36.957 --> 03:38:39.279]  If they're a right-winger, they say I'm a leftist.
[03:38:39.279 --> 03:38:41.440]  And if they're a leftist, they say I'm a right-winger.
[03:38:41.440 --> 03:38:50.268]  And they just say that and then never address the facts we've laid out, never address the information we put out.
[03:38:50.268 --> 03:38:55.212]  Let me punch up my call screen here, so John can send me any callers.
[03:38:57.967 --> 03:38:59.208]  From Minnesota.
[03:38:59.208 --> 03:39:00.329]  We're down here in Austin, Texas.
[03:39:00.329 --> 03:39:01.250]  They're up there in Minnesota.
[03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:06.294]  We can also take calls on our system, but 1-800-259-9231.
[03:39:06.294 --> 03:39:08.056]  Some of these I said I'd mention.
[03:39:08.056 --> 03:39:10.518]  Obama claims CIA involvement in Iran patently false.
[03:39:10.518 --> 03:39:14.742]  I mean, what an asinine lie.
[03:39:14.742 --> 03:39:18.986]  What a asinine lie when the CIA admits they're doing it.
[03:39:20.143 --> 03:39:26.226]  And I was just watching CNN during the break, and it's all about the police are beating the people and not allowing protest.
[03:39:26.226 --> 03:39:28.727]  What do you think happens around here in most areas of the U.S.
[03:39:28.727 --> 03:39:31.228]  if you don't get a permit?
[03:39:31.228 --> 03:39:39.532]  The cops dress up like protesters, attack their own officers, and then start breaking collarbones, and in some cases, shooting people to death with rubber bullets.
[03:39:39.532 --> 03:39:43.133]  Now, I'm not defending that, and I'm not defending the Mulas.
[03:39:43.133 --> 03:39:49.316]  The issue is, this thing is CIA-funded on record, and the media shouldn't be lying to everybody, saying it isn't true.
[03:39:51.952 --> 03:39:57.656]  And they want to demonize Iran so the whole country can be smart-bombed and you'll see a whole bunch of dead women bleeding to death.
[03:39:57.656 --> 03:40:00.878]  But you won't see it on our news then.
[03:40:00.878 --> 03:40:07.682]  You seen somebody when a big 2,000 pound bomb blows up 50 yards away and they get cut in half or get their head blown off?
[03:40:07.682 --> 03:40:09.383]  There's lots of blood then.
[03:40:09.383 --> 03:40:11.324]  You seen all the photos of dead little kids everywhere?
[03:40:11.324 --> 03:40:16.507]  And the neocons send me threatening emails when we post them going, good, kill more of them kids!
[03:40:16.507 --> 03:40:18.909]  See, you're being manipulated with psychology.
[03:40:21.574 --> 03:40:28.916]  And they want to put a guy in power who announced he won the election before the polls were closed so he could then cause it.
[03:40:28.916 --> 03:40:33.238]  And when he's the guy that bombed the Marine Corps barracks, you're now loving the guy.
[03:40:33.238 --> 03:40:35.198]  But see, that's how you now love Gaddafi.
[03:40:35.198 --> 03:40:38.079]  Because you're not real conservatives, those of you out there.
[03:40:38.079 --> 03:40:42.140]  You're sicko freaks who are just mentally ill and worship the system.
[03:40:42.140 --> 03:40:42.981]  You're toadies.
[03:40:42.981 --> 03:40:44.521]  You're boot lickers.
[03:40:44.521 --> 03:40:45.542]  You're cowards.
[03:40:45.542 --> 03:40:46.722]  But none of this is important.
[03:40:47.748 --> 03:40:50.529]  Missing governor was in Argentina.
[03:40:50.529 --> 03:40:53.150]  He told everybody he was going on vacation.
[03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:54.230]  He told them where he was.
[03:40:54.230 --> 03:40:59.492]  His political enemies made this up.
[03:40:59.492 --> 03:41:02.573]  And because he's not going along with the new world order on several issues.
[03:41:02.573 --> 03:41:05.594]  I'm not saying the guy's a good guy.
[03:41:05.594 --> 03:41:14.958]  It's just like Ron Paul gets told he's in a big hotel banquet room next to a suite and that an Austrian newspaper wants to interview him.
[03:41:15.956 --> 03:41:18.697]  And he walks in and they say, please go in here, sir, while we move some equipment.
[03:41:18.697 --> 03:41:20.638]  He goes into a room next to it.
[03:41:20.638 --> 03:41:29.362]  Sacha Baron Cohen runs in and drops his pants, and Ron Paul runs out of the room, and the media is saying, Ron Paul's got to explain himself.
[03:41:29.362 --> 03:41:32.203]  See, this is them trying to kill his political future.
[03:41:32.203 --> 03:41:34.905]  And the dumb public loves petty things like this.
[03:41:34.905 --> 03:41:37.226]  Oh, the governor went somewhere.
[03:41:37.226 --> 03:41:38.726]  He's bad.
[03:41:38.726 --> 03:41:42.068]  Oh, Ron Paul got set up by the guy that did Borat.
[03:41:43.675 --> 03:41:46.035]  Meanwhile, they're putting cancer viruses in your shots.
[03:41:46.035 --> 03:41:49.496]  I mean, can you start caring about the cancer viruses in your shots?
[03:41:49.496 --> 03:41:51.597]  Do you care about your kids enough to do that?
[03:41:51.597 --> 03:41:56.217]  Can you at least stop giving them fluoride water?
[03:41:56.217 --> 03:42:09.200]  By the way, the stuff you buy from municipal water supplies, it better come from a spring if it's bottled water, or it means it was put through just charcoal filters and the fluoride was left in.
[03:42:14.101 --> 03:42:26.731]  And I can't believe I'm the radical, I'm the bad guy, because Mousavi, they pronounce it different ways, celebrated in Iran, protested, but was the butchers of Beirut on record.
[03:42:26.731 --> 03:42:28.972]  Now I'm bad because I'm not for blowing up the Marines.
[03:42:28.972 --> 03:42:32.475]  I mean, that's how sick these neocons are, man.
[03:42:32.475 --> 03:42:38.660]  And Obama, look at this liar saying the CIA's not involved, when the CIA's on record running the whole thing, bragging about it.
[03:42:38.660 --> 03:42:42.803]  You got Brzezinski and Bolton and Kissinger bragging they're running it.
[03:42:45.356 --> 03:42:49.399]  And then he's on TV saying, I mean, look at that cokehead liar.
[03:42:49.399 --> 03:42:56.405]  There's just no end to these people.
[03:42:56.405 --> 03:43:02.810]  Western Stooge, son of the Shah, positioning himself to take power in Iran.
[03:43:02.810 --> 03:43:08.495]  Got this report up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:43:08.495 --> 03:43:10.176]  Look at this exclusive, U.S.
[03:43:10.176 --> 03:43:12.118]  contacted Ayatollahs before election.
[03:43:14.142 --> 03:43:16.263]  State cuts tax exemptions for kids.
[03:43:16.263 --> 03:43:17.263]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[03:43:17.263 --> 03:43:17.904]  See?
[03:43:17.904 --> 03:43:20.145]  And then next they're going to tax you for having kids.
[03:43:20.145 --> 03:43:21.505]  They're already announcing that.
[03:43:21.505 --> 03:43:27.848]  That's the San Francisco Chronicle.
[03:43:27.848 --> 03:43:32.229]  Right there.
[03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:42.954]  And you know, I guess going back to Iran, the big message here is the police state's good, but not the police state's good,
[03:43:45.956 --> 03:43:48.098]  But not in Iran.
[03:43:48.098 --> 03:43:49.759]  Then it's bad.
[03:43:49.759 --> 03:43:53.422]  Documents back Saudi links to extremist New York Times.
[03:43:53.422 --> 03:43:55.384]  This just came out today.
[03:43:55.384 --> 03:43:57.226]  Of course, that was a Saudi operation.
[03:43:57.226 --> 03:44:00.408]  Who works for the CIA in Mossad?
[03:44:00.408 --> 03:44:04.832]  We've already had the head of the embassy there on tape saying, yeah, they told us to let the hijackers in the U.S.
[03:44:04.832 --> 03:44:08.735]  even though they were flagged as terrorists because that was a CIA cover.
[03:44:08.735 --> 03:44:11.398]  Pakistan official behind killing of 11 French engineers.
[03:44:13.285 --> 03:44:14.286]  And then look at this report.
[03:44:14.286 --> 03:44:17.408]  Climate bill set for vote after deal is reached.
[03:44:17.408 --> 03:44:29.557]  They're saying they're not letting the public see the bill, but that it does have a tax on all carbon, and the feds are basically completely taking over, but the public can't see the bill before it is passed.
[03:44:29.557 --> 03:44:31.179]  You can go read the Wall Street Journal article.
[03:44:31.179 --> 03:44:42.948]  And they just act like that's totally normal, because the Wall Street Journal, owned by the big banks and Rupert Murdoch, is going to be taking your money and putting it directly in their fat mouths, just like Goldman Sachs is getting record bonus money off the bailout money.
[03:44:44.238 --> 03:44:47.339]  Record bonuses for those crooks.
[03:44:47.339 --> 03:44:49.480]  Obama, we will get health care reform this year.
[03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:57.224]  And it'll be like the kind of care the Native Americans get, being sterilized and euthanized, the kind the VA veterans get.
[03:44:57.224 --> 03:44:59.765]  Obama condemns violence against Iranian protesters.
[03:44:59.765 --> 03:45:04.947]  It's all just too rich.
[03:45:04.947 --> 03:45:07.429]  Got a few other stories I'm going to hit, but let's go to calls right now.
[03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:09.710]  John in Washington, you're on the air.
[03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:11.430]  Go ahead.
[03:45:11.430 --> 03:45:12.311]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:45:14.011 --> 03:45:14.591]  I'm doing good.
[03:45:14.591 --> 03:45:15.832]  I'm exposing these murderers.
[03:45:15.832 --> 03:45:16.912]  That's what I do.
[03:45:16.912 --> 03:45:18.773]  Well, that's what I'm trying to do here, too.
[03:45:18.773 --> 03:45:39.980]  I live right between two relatively large Indian reservations, and I've had several discussions with these folks about, oh, just different things, and a great deal about this eugenics issue, and they just basically open-handedly deny it.
[03:45:39.980 --> 03:45:41.160]  So what I've done is I've
[03:45:41.724 --> 03:46:09.720]  rented the uh... screening room at the community center and i'm going to invite all of the officials from the uh... yeah i know this works or that we're just gonna watch that uh... watch that show and see what they think about that good let me explain how this works they're not evil people probably but they're in denial they rationalize what they're doing cuz they think reality is what they decided is in their head like oh this isn't a cliff i'll just jump off but but it is a cliff
[03:46:10.731 --> 03:46:12.112]  So they're delusional.
[03:46:12.112 --> 03:46:13.974]  And they always hire people.
[03:46:13.974 --> 03:46:18.638]  The government always gives the money to the little group that steals most of it, controls it.
[03:46:19.999 --> 03:46:22.220]  And, you know, it's the corrupt Indian agents.
[03:46:22.220 --> 03:46:24.501]  And then they just hire the corrupt tribes to do it.
[03:46:24.501 --> 03:46:31.403]  It's on Congressional record that up until the 1980s, they sterilized 40 plus percent of Native American women.
[03:46:31.403 --> 03:46:33.584]  It was the London Guardian yesterday, the U.N.
[03:46:33.584 --> 03:46:36.825]  sterilizing women and lying to them about what the procedure is.
[03:46:36.825 --> 03:46:38.325]  They just say, oh, I am the doctor.
[03:46:38.325 --> 03:46:40.066]  You need to be put under now, honey.
[03:46:40.066 --> 03:46:41.987]  And we're going to give you medicine for that broken leg.
[03:46:41.987 --> 03:46:43.327]  And they sterilize you.
[03:46:43.327 --> 03:46:46.848]  Or you come in for dentistry and they knock you out on the gas and sterilize you.
[03:46:46.848 --> 03:46:48.409]  So that's London Guardian yesterday.
[03:46:49.514 --> 03:47:00.863]  So, all of this is happening and going on, so I would go to the tribes themselves and explain, you know, the PIMP leaders are in denial.
[03:47:00.863 --> 03:47:03.465]  Because they don't want to notice what's going on, but go ahead.
[03:47:03.465 --> 03:47:10.631]  We get personal invitations to this and the screening room is at the community center on the reservation.
[03:47:10.631 --> 03:47:18.577]  So, we're going to draw a crowd there one way or the other and just let them understand because what bothers me so much about this
[03:47:19.275 --> 03:47:19.395]  Is it?
[03:47:38.573 --> 03:47:43.714]  The Indian tribes, name one treaty that the federal government has ever lived up to.
[03:47:43.714 --> 03:47:44.374]  No, no, exactly.
[03:47:44.374 --> 03:47:50.355]  I've got articles today where they're making six-year-olds go into counseling if they misbehave in school.
[03:47:50.355 --> 03:47:57.856]  It's going into a mind control induction cult center where they tell the parents, don't discipline your kids.
[03:47:57.856 --> 03:48:00.477]  Then the kids are bad and the state tasers them to death.
[03:48:00.477 --> 03:48:04.938]  This is all about mind control, all about the state stirring up as much trouble as they can.
[03:48:04.938 --> 03:48:06.338]  It's in their own handbooks.
[03:48:06.338 --> 03:48:07.218]  I appreciate your call.
[03:48:08.018 --> 03:48:10.418]  Order Outta Chaos, Nate in Georgia.
[03:48:10.418 --> 03:48:12.159]  Nate, you're on the air.
[03:48:12.159 --> 03:48:13.199]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:48:13.199 --> 03:48:15.720]  Good.
[03:48:15.720 --> 03:48:18.480]  Well, the reason why I'm calling, first and foremost, I wanted to thank you.
[03:48:18.480 --> 03:48:25.861]  I have watched a lot of the Dead Guys movies back before I had discovered you, and you really turned me on and opened me up a little bit more.
[03:48:25.861 --> 03:48:33.503]  However, this call is actually concerning today's show and another show that you had a couple days ago about the reptilian brain.
[03:48:34.196 --> 03:48:41.921]  And, uh, I did some research on the reptilian brain and how it functions and I was appalled at the stuff that I found out.
[03:48:41.921 --> 03:48:49.786]  Um, well, concerning the eugenics program that you're talking about, um, I did some little research and I put two and two together.
[03:48:49.786 --> 03:48:57.090]  Well, I was on YouTube the other day and just going through some clips about the reptilian brain and I read, I came across this one clip
[03:48:58.124 --> 03:49:00.966]  It said, uh, what lies in plain sight?
[03:49:00.966 --> 03:49:03.128]  And it was a Michael Jackson video.
[03:49:03.128 --> 03:49:22.404]  Well, this gentleman did an analytical breakdown of the video, and it was a psychological manipulation, teaching people to engage in homosexuality and, uh, uh, male, um, male homosexuality and male... Here's the deal, I'm not even judging or attacking those people, but the issue is, yes,
[03:49:23.553 --> 03:49:29.077]  Yes, if you go to Planned Parenthood's main website, it's all about how to be gay or lesbian because they don't want you having kids.
[03:49:29.077 --> 03:49:37.403]  They decided a hundred plus years ago, teach the slaves to not have families, break the family up, try to make it fashionable to have
[03:49:38.784 --> 03:49:46.706]  Male-on-male, female-on-female, so that they stop having kids, so they don't have a family unit, so society is decimated.
[03:49:46.706 --> 03:49:53.668]  See, they want everybody to be part of the state, so the family has to go to be absorbed, so it's them persecuting the family.
[03:49:53.668 --> 03:49:57.369]  CPS takes the babies to give to the gay and lesbian families.
[03:49:57.369 --> 03:50:07.072]  We don't like being persecuted and hunted by you like it's Planet of the Apes, and your CPS are throwing nets over us and our kids because, you know, because you want them for yourself.
[03:50:07.552 --> 03:50:11.335]  You know, as a slave back at the... And I mean, basically, that's what this is.
[03:50:11.335 --> 03:50:12.836]  They're attacking us.
[03:50:12.836 --> 03:50:17.940]  Not the average gay person out in the street, but the big controllers up above.
[03:50:17.940 --> 03:50:19.201]  That's what they're into.
[03:50:19.201 --> 03:50:21.042]  And yes, I was familiar with that.
[03:50:21.042 --> 03:50:24.045]  And for those that don't know, it's not David Icke and the whole reptilian thing.
[03:50:24.045 --> 03:50:27.527]  It's that in physiology, it's taught in medical school.
[03:50:27.527 --> 03:50:30.189]  You have the brain stem, the reptilian brain, different parts of the brain.
[03:50:30.189 --> 03:50:34.252]  It's called the reptilian brain because it's shaped like a saltwater crocodile brain.
[03:50:35.554 --> 03:50:42.086]  And it has all those primitive functions of fight, flight, aggression, all of that in it.
[03:50:42.086 --> 03:50:47.256]  And that's the kind of base programming that subliminals and things manipulate.
[03:50:48.439 --> 03:50:55.141]  That's why they want to get you in a mesmerized fashion watching TV, so you'll kind of switch off and then just accept it all.
[03:50:55.141 --> 03:50:57.501]  We'll finish up with you, Nate, then talk to Brian.
[03:50:57.501 --> 03:50:58.162]  Brian just hung up.
[03:50:58.162 --> 03:50:59.942]  Joe, John, and Jeff, we have time.
[03:50:59.942 --> 03:51:00.362]  Stay with us.
[03:51:00.362 --> 03:51:01.703]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:51:01.703 --> 03:51:02.983]  Economy have you down?
[03:51:02.983 --> 03:51:04.663]  Scared you might lose your job?
[03:51:04.663 --> 03:51:06.504]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[03:51:06.744 --> 03:51:08.846]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[03:51:08.846 --> 03:51:12.169]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[03:51:12.169 --> 03:51:16.693]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[03:51:16.693 --> 03:51:20.256]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book.
[03:51:20.256 --> 03:51:21.157]  And the best part?
[03:51:21.157 --> 03:51:23.199]  This book is priced under $10.
[03:51:23.199 --> 03:51:25.101]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!
[03:51:25.101 --> 03:51:27.222]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:27.222 --> 03:51:29.084]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:29.084 --> 03:51:30.365]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:31.266 --> 03:51:32.867]  Want to know about your retirement portfolio?

[03:51:52.820 --> 03:51:52.860]  877-479-8178.
[03:52:02.247 --> 03:52:08.292]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.292 --> 03:52:14.177]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.177 --> 03:52:20.323]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.663 --> 03:52:22.625]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.625 --> 03:52:25.106]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.106 --> 03:52:38.296]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.296 --> 03:52:39.957]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.957 --> 03:52:41.818]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.818 --> 03:52:48.043]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:56.973 --> 03:52:58.554]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.554 --> 03:53:01.255]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.255 --> 03:53:05.818]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:53:05.818 --> 03:53:08.379]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:53:08.379 --> 03:53:17.824]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:53:17.824 --> 03:53:18.444]  We're good to go.
[03:53:37.009 --> 03:53:37.649]  I think so.
[03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:08.070]  All right, finish up with Nate and a few others.
[03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:17.594]  But look, I just covered that Times of London Billionaire Club to bid... Billionaire Club and bid to curb overpopulation with world government.
[03:54:17.594 --> 03:54:20.175]  And then look at another Times of London article.
[03:54:20.175 --> 03:54:26.518]  UK population must fall to 30 million or by half for the green carbon footprint.
[03:54:26.518 --> 03:54:27.519]  Zoom in on that for folks.
[03:54:29.028 --> 03:54:32.789]  See, and the same thing in Australia, same thing in the U.S.
[03:54:32.789 --> 03:54:36.651]  Having kids is what's making the planet worse, as Fox News says.
[03:54:36.651 --> 03:54:41.573]  They're all part of it, left and right, it's all staged.
[03:54:41.573 --> 03:54:46.995]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the reality.
[03:54:48.598 --> 03:54:52.620]  This is what they're into, this is what they're pushing, this is what everything revolves around.
[03:54:52.620 --> 03:54:57.122]  You can't let the establishment always set the agenda of whatever new diversion or distraction it is.
[03:54:57.122 --> 03:55:02.184]  You've got to set the agenda on eugenics, and then we know who they are and what they're doing.
[03:55:02.184 --> 03:55:03.584]  Bunch of criminals.
[03:55:03.584 --> 03:55:06.345]  Let's go ahead, Nate, finish up the point you were making.
[03:55:06.345 --> 03:55:16.870]  Well, the one last thing I wanted to tell you about was, uh, uh, there's a, uh, you were speaking about pedophilia earlier in the show, um, and how they're, they're taking people's babies.
[03:55:17.996 --> 03:55:23.158]  Again, while doing our research, I came across another video clip on YouTube.
[03:55:23.158 --> 03:55:31.461]  This video clip was called, uh, Demons in the Outfield, and it was a documentary on movies that were publicized for children.
[03:55:31.461 --> 03:55:36.083]  And this movie had an incredible amount of sub-subliminal pedophilia.
[03:55:36.083 --> 03:55:37.823]  An incredible amount.
[03:55:37.823 --> 03:55:40.404]  And this movie was made about ten years ago.
[03:55:40.404 --> 03:55:45.186]  So since then, I did a little bit of more research, and I found that since this movie was released,
[03:55:45.666 --> 03:55:49.429]  The amount of pedophilia has like literally gone, has almost doubled.
[03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:50.430]  I hear you, sir.
[03:55:50.430 --> 03:55:51.131]  I gotta jump.
[03:55:51.131 --> 03:55:54.934]  Send me the info or write a blurb on it at writers and infowars.com.
[03:55:54.934 --> 03:55:58.858]  Email that and we'll get your good stories up on infowars.com and prisonblood.com.
[03:55:58.858 --> 03:56:08.426]  I'm gonna go to a few other callers, but you just heard for the last hour and a half one of the, it's in the top three biggest pro-life groups in the country, the director.
[03:56:09.595 --> 03:56:17.123]  Breathing heavy, going, I've discovered in the last three years it's all eugenics and it's pedophiles.
[03:56:17.123 --> 03:56:21.747]  And by the way, in the film, what they cite as one of their sources is in-game.
[03:56:21.747 --> 03:56:25.671]  See, if the people learn about this, it's all over.
[03:56:25.671 --> 03:56:27.233]  We're going to beat these people.
[03:56:27.233 --> 03:56:31.898]  But the public can't believe that pedophiles, a pedophile guild, is running things.
[03:56:32.810 --> 03:56:33.851]  But that's what it is.
[03:56:33.851 --> 03:56:38.456]  I mean, these people are the sickest filth you can imagine.
[03:56:38.456 --> 03:56:43.181]  And what Planned Parenthood does is they cover up for kids 10 years old.
[03:56:43.181 --> 03:56:44.963]  Don't have to have family permission.
[03:56:44.963 --> 03:56:54.413]  Kids gotta have permission slip to go to the zoo at school or to, you know, go to the planetarium, but not when teacher impregnates her.
[03:56:55.305 --> 03:56:58.786]  And they take her to the pedophile center, Planned Parenthood, and they kill the baby.
[03:56:58.786 --> 03:57:03.367]  So, you know, now it's not just killing the babies okay, now raping the kids alright.
[03:57:03.367 --> 03:57:07.147]  And then meanwhile, you know, it's just all over, folks.
[03:57:07.147 --> 03:57:11.588]  It's just... And the police will not enforce.
[03:57:11.588 --> 03:57:13.129]  Planned Parenthood's never gotten in trouble.
[03:57:13.129 --> 03:57:16.449]  They're allowed to have pedophiles bring kids in all day long.
[03:57:16.449 --> 03:57:18.770]  We'll murder that baby for you, you don't worry.
[03:57:18.770 --> 03:57:19.490]  Is it black?
[03:57:19.490 --> 03:57:19.970]  Even better.
[03:57:21.960 --> 03:57:24.982]  I said I'd take more calls, and we're just out of time.
[03:57:24.982 --> 03:57:26.923]  Let's take one more.
[03:57:26.923 --> 03:57:29.245]  Let's talk to Joe in Ohio.
[03:57:29.245 --> 03:57:30.526]  Joe, go ahead.
[03:57:30.526 --> 03:57:31.927]  Alright, Alex, thank you.
[03:57:31.927 --> 03:57:35.009]  I just wanted to give you a website, hmdb.org.
[03:57:35.009 --> 03:57:36.950]  It's the historical marker database.
[03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:39.592]  It shows government markers around the country.
[03:57:39.592 --> 03:57:44.635]  If you look at number 1829, it says the Indiana Eugenics Law.
[03:57:44.635 --> 03:57:51.200]  By 1800, Indiana authorities believed criminality, mental problems, and pauperism were hereditary.
[03:57:51.658 --> 03:57:55.703]  And the governor passed the first of the state eugenics laws.
[03:57:55.703 --> 03:58:02.190]  And one of my marshals, which is what I am, is Governor Thomas Riley Marshall.
[03:58:02.190 --> 03:58:03.131]  He hauled at this in 1909.
[03:58:04.944 --> 03:58:09.908]  And evidently they didn't repeal all of the laws until 1974.
[03:58:09.908 --> 03:58:14.111]  Yeah, no, they had forced sterilization going on in Oregon in 87.
[03:58:14.111 --> 03:58:14.732]  Send me that.
[03:58:14.732 --> 03:58:17.154]  Send it to Aram with two A's at Infowars.com.
[03:58:17.154 --> 03:58:18.135]  No, it's all public.
[03:58:18.135 --> 03:58:23.699]  I mean, it's... The health departments were set up to sterilize and kill people.
[03:58:23.699 --> 03:58:26.822]  I mean, they don't put fluoride in your water because they love you.
[03:58:26.822 --> 03:58:29.023]  I mean, they want to hurt you.
[03:58:29.844 --> 03:58:30.704]  All right.
[03:58:30.704 --> 03:58:32.045]  Look, Retransmission starts now.

[03:58:39.246 --> 03:58:40.267]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:40.267 --> 03:58:43.087]  Retransmission starts now.

[03:58:51.581 --> 03:58:56.785]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.785 --> 03:59:00.808]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.808 --> 03:59:06.713]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.713 --> 03:59:11.776]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.776 --> 03:59:12.277]  Number three,
[03:59:12.677 --> 03:59:18.979]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:18.979 --> 03:59:21.880]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.880 --> 03:59:26.401]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.401 --> 03:59:30.002]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.242 --> 03:59:35.990]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
