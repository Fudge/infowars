[00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:09.637]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:11.219]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.160]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:21.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:23.993]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:27.216]  It is Thursday, October 1st, 2009.
[00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:36.582]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones, but we are immediately going to Alex Jones in Hardin, Montana at the scene of the FEMA camp.
[00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:38.604]  Alex?
[00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:45.429]  Yes Jason, I am here and I'm just a few blocks away from the FEMA camp in Hardin, Montana.
[00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:54.273]  It is confirmed that Homeland Security is looking at making this the main Guantanamo Bay West, as CNN has called it.
[00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:58.156]  There are so many angles and facets to this story.
[00:00:58.156 --> 00:01:12.447]  We've now had a chance to talk to locals who actually have homes that border the $27 million facility that was built two years ago, and it's very secretive.
[00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.988]  Who owns it?
[00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:14.648]  Who runs it?
[00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:15.409]  Who's leasing it?
[00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:17.564]  I've talked to locals.
[00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:31.794]  They say that the Germans that are here, the Serbs that are here, the Brits that are here, and other Eastern Europeans that are here at the facility will talk to no one and will not say why they're here.
[00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:45.003]  But I've talked to some locals who have a home literally bordering the camp, because it's right off downtown, some of the historic Victorian homes here, and they said that they know this Mr.
[00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.111]  Hilton, who goes by Michael Hilton.
[00:01:49.111 --> 00:02:04.560]  The Billings Gazette is reporting yesterday and today that Hilton has three different aliases and is actually from Montenegro in the Balkans in Serbia.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.425]  They, of course, really freaked people out last week when they started having black SUVs patrol down the city of Hardin that said
[00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:16.935]  Harden Police Force, National Police Force.
[00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:21.777]  And here is the Billings Gazette in front of me today, the actual newspaper.
[00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:26.658]  American Police Force official, Hilton, has history of legal trouble.
[00:02:26.658 --> 00:02:30.219]  California man pleads guilty to 14 felonies.
[00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.420]  In 1993, used several aliases.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.043]  Grand theft auto, attempted grand theft auto, fraudulent construction deals, pleading guilty to just all sorts of crimes.
[00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:47.314]  In Orange County, Orange County Court Records show, his real name is not Hilton.
[00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:57.097]  He has Muslim surnames, Serb surnames, very, very shadowy character, hooked up with Homeland Security.
[00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:09.280]  We've confirmed with locals that there are constant black SUVs, constant black Humvees, as we've had calls in the last few days on Airabout, that Blackhawk helicopters have been hovering in and around town.
[00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:13.917]  The last year landing and taking off near the base.
[00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:17.140]  It is literally spook central here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.801]  So here's what we know.
[00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:35.576]  In the last year, a very secretive organization known as the American Police Force that claims it can land a battalion of Special Forces troops within 24 hours anywhere in the world has arrived with Homeland Security vehicles as well.
[00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:43.491]  And they have taken over the $27 million facility that was built two years ago and never held prisoners.
[00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:48.686]  We also talked to locals and said there's a British architect here that's also admitted by the group.
[00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:57.152]  They're planning on expanding the camp and they say it's going to be a mercenary training center, a quote, contractor combat troop training center for at least 5,000 troops.
[00:03:57.152 --> 00:04:04.718]  They say in the next month, quote, everything will be made public and that thousands of personnel are going to be arriving here.
[00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:09.601]  They have hundreds of personnel right now here in the town.
[00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:10.562]  There's this shadowy
[00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:24.159]  Two Rivers Development Corporation that's basically running the town of Hardin, the poorest town, around 4,000 people, the poorest town in Montana, listed by the state.
[00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:33.023]  The state has been trying to find out for years what's going on out here, but because it borders, part of the town is on the pro-MN reservation, the other half isn't.
[00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:36.949]  Uh, so it's kind of a no-man's land here.
[00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.693]  Uh, so just very, very bizarre situation that we're going to be covering.
[00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:46.797]  I'm going to go over to the camp and start asking more questions of city officials in the next two hours.
[00:04:46.797 --> 00:04:56.305]  And then in the third hour of the radio show today, I'll be on air with you, uh, Mr. Hollingsworth, uh, who's given us some great reports from here in Montana.
[00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:57.686]  Back after this with Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:07.777]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:13.863]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:16.826]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:22.732]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:24.673]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:27.155]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:32.779]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.881]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:36.622]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.622 --> 00:05:39.144]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:43.887]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:47.590]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.731]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:50.692 --> 00:05:52.599]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.726]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:08.245]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:16.849]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.591]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:25.533]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:29.675]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:30.335]  We're good.
[00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:01.963]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.705]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:06.387]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:11.531]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:14.714]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:08.482]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.482 --> 00:08:13.146]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:13.846]  We are back.
[00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:14.767]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:16.348]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in.
[00:08:16.348 --> 00:08:24.254]  We're going to be going over the latest vaccination news, including the military losing yet another battle against mandatory anthrax vaccinations.
[00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:29.038]  But right now, we go back to Alex Jones in Hardin, Montana, at the scene of the FEMA camp.
[00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:37.794]  Absolutely, I am in occupied Montana, occupied by a shadowy mercenary organization out of Serbia.
[00:08:37.794 --> 00:08:42.217]  That is confirmed now in the Billings Gazette in two separate articles.
[00:08:42.217 --> 00:08:46.680]  One yesterday, now one today on Thursday, October 1st, 2009.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.260]  We are live.
[00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:56.204]  Headline in the Billings Gazette, top story, American Police Force official Hilton has history of legal trouble.
[00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:58.646]  But just to correct myself, it's not Grand Theft Auto.
[00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:05.609]  It's pleading guilty to grand theft, an attempted grand theft, period, and diverting construction funds.
[00:09:05.609 --> 00:09:08.230]  That looks like that's his specialty.
[00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.252]  He is getting into contracts and then running scams there.
[00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:14.213]  He's pled guilty to 14 felonies.
[00:09:14.213 --> 00:09:16.955]  In 1993, he uses at least three different aliases.
[00:09:17.886 --> 00:09:21.032]  Burmas, give us his reported real name from Serbia.
[00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:28.073]  Well, they're saying he's got two aliases with the last surname Dokovich, which would lead me to believe that that's probably his real name.
[00:09:28.073 --> 00:09:30.995]  They don't really tell you what his actual name is.
[00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:36.379]  The two aliases with Dokovich are Mirodrag and Midrag Ilya.
[00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:38.620]  So, obviously this guy's a foreigner.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:48.747]  I mean, it's unbelievable we have private mercenaries on the street headed up by a foreign mercenary who was pleaded guilty to over 14 felonies, Alex.
[00:09:51.032 --> 00:09:56.897]  I don't want to give away our sources, but there's quite a few hotels right around the FEMA camp.
[00:09:56.897 --> 00:10:03.842]  So I went in this morning and questioned, been doing some gumshoe, shoe leather work here, detective work.
[00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:06.605]  And I just went in and point blank said, I'm Alex Jones from Austin, Texas.
[00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:10.768]  We're doing a story on the detention center.
[00:10:10.768 --> 00:10:16.312]  And they would start talking and saying, yes, they all stay here.
[00:10:16.312 --> 00:10:20.656]  There is a old Serb man who only goes by Chetar.
[00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:24.423]  He is the father of Mr. Hilton.
[00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:26.504]  We don't know why their two names are different.
[00:10:26.504 --> 00:10:27.544]  I said, who else is with him?
[00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.125]  And they said, Germans.
[00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.445]  They said, Eastern Europeans.
[00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:32.186]  They said, Brits.
[00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:33.286]  And I said, how many?
[00:10:33.286 --> 00:10:36.367]  And just hundreds and hundreds of paramilitary soldiers.
[00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:37.928]  They're very secretive.
[00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:43.770]  They tend to pay with cash and won't even tell people their last names.
[00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.891]  So I figured if they were trying to get control of this facility in the last year, they would have been staying in hotels.
[00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:50.826]  In downtown right off the facility.
[00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:52.427]  We were correct.
[00:10:52.427 --> 00:10:58.370]  We know we're going to get turned around at the door at the local city and county seat.
[00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.331]  But we're still going to go there.
[00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:04.194]  We're going to go talk to this spokeswoman who worked for the Billings Gazette for 19 years and has suddenly been hired.
[00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.143]  By American police force.
[00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:10.266]  A lot of people have pointed out the double head eagle is the Serb symbol.
[00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:13.128]  We also knew it was the Illuminati symbol.
[00:11:13.128 --> 00:11:15.930]  And also the Russian Republic symbol.
[00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.492]  But we confirmed that it is the Serb code of arms.
[00:11:18.492 --> 00:11:20.894]  They're using it because it's a Serb run.
[00:11:20.894 --> 00:11:23.136]  Paul Watson has done some detective work confirming
[00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:28.748]  What other researchers have said in the last few days, this is connected to Blackwater and other shadowy groups.
[00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:33.472]  It appears this is a cutout, or a smokescreen, or a front group for a larger organization.
[00:11:33.472 --> 00:11:44.981]  We've confirmed Homeland Security has been in town, black SUVs, black Humvees, bizarre military drills on people's property, blackhawk helicopters.
[00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:53.008]  We talked to locals that said, yeah, I'll be out picking flowers in the field, as the locals do around here, and a helicopter will come hover right over them.
[00:11:53.944 --> 00:11:56.825]  Uh, one person was said that they were out hunting dinosaur bones.
[00:11:56.825 --> 00:11:58.006]  There's a lot of those.
[00:11:58.006 --> 00:11:59.267]  Dinosaur fossils.
[00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:02.648]  And then a Black Hawk helicopter came and hovered right over them.
[00:12:02.648 --> 00:12:04.229]  Uh, and basically ran them off.
[00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:06.450]  So this whole place is just crawling with spooks.
[00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.251]  This is a major test operation.
[00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:22.317]  And... We have confirmed, uh, what Michael Hollingsworth was saying yesterday on the show, that American Police Force is trying to set up facilities in multiple states, including California, Texas, Michigan,
[00:12:23.107 --> 00:12:34.971]  Uh, and other areas, so we've confirmed that A, Homeland Security is looking at this site for a FEMA center, that B, shadowy merc groups have run what are known as black sites, but not just black sites, ghost sites.
[00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:38.972]  The black site's just a secret, clandestine site.
[00:12:38.972 --> 00:12:42.473]  A ghost site is a black site where they hold detainees.
[00:12:42.473 --> 00:12:47.315]  There is a 98% probability, in my estimation, that this is a
[00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:48.714]  I don't know.
[00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:04.055]  We have absolutely hit the mother load here.
[00:13:04.055 --> 00:13:08.759]  This is a confirmed FEMA camp being shut up in Hardin, Montana.
[00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:12.361]  They admit they assessed it and chose it because the economy is collapsing.
[00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:15.403]  One of the poorest communities in the United States here.
[00:13:15.403 --> 00:13:20.226]  I'm looking at poor Native Indians wandering, Native Americans wandering around on the streets.
[00:13:20.226 --> 00:13:21.487]  I'm looking at bag ladies.
[00:13:21.487 --> 00:13:25.370]  I'm also looking at cowboys and people coming into grocery stores right now.
[00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.412]  I am here just witnessing a really depressed economy.
[00:13:29.345 --> 00:13:30.567]  I don't think so.
[00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:46.412]  Right now, they're really taking over the town.
[00:13:46.412 --> 00:13:52.313]  They've also made statements to the news media and others that we don't care what the town wants or what people say now.
[00:13:52.313 --> 00:13:53.314]  We've got the lease.
[00:13:53.314 --> 00:13:53.874]  This is it.
[00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:54.314]  It's ours.
[00:13:54.314 --> 00:13:56.014]  We've paid $2.5 million.
[00:13:56.014 --> 00:14:02.997]  This $27 million facility paid for by the taxpayers of the county that we're in.
[00:14:02.997 --> 00:14:08.378]  We're going to talk to the Big Horn Sheriff's Department about this as well.
[00:14:08.378 --> 00:14:12.559]  The acting director is also the school board superintendent, Al Peterson.
[00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:14.240]  He's the acting director of the Two Rivers
[00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:15.914]  Uh, authority.
[00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:21.158]  So you just got these classic authorities, like a third-world country, just coming in, taking over the town, taking over the county.
[00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:22.780]  Uh, they won't say where the money's coming from.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:33.368]  They won't say why suddenly black SUVs, black Mercedes SUVs, showed up with the Serb insignia, the double-headed eagle, beside it.
[00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:35.009]  Hardened police.
[00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:37.511]  Uh, we're gonna go talk to locals about them pulling people over.
[00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:44.217]  It was sleeting and raining last night at 1030 when we arrived, after flying in, uh, on a, uh,
[00:14:44.724 --> 00:14:49.451]  Turboprop aircraft landing on the Mesa top where they have the Billings Airport.
[00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:54.598]  We drove out here through Custard, the town of Custard, that's where the Battle of the Little Bighorn happened.
[00:14:54.598 --> 00:15:00.306]  Came into the town last night and it was raining so hard we should have stopped and done it, but it appeared.
[00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:00.947]  It appeared!
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.521]  Well, I looked at the crest and it said Hardin Police.
[00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:04.942]  There is no Hardin Police.
[00:15:04.942 --> 00:15:10.345]  And they had someone pulled over less than 200 yards from the FEMA facility.
[00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:12.006]  This is what they do with these cutouts.
[00:15:12.006 --> 00:15:14.127]  We should have stopped and gotten it, but it was sleeting so hard.
[00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:17.129]  I just wanted to find the place where we were staying.
[00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:20.190]  But I did see that it said Hardin Police, so I'm going to go question people.
[00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:26.954]  It looks like, unless there's a new Hardin Police Department they say doesn't exist, that they may be running police operations here right now.
[00:15:26.954 --> 00:15:28.735]  I just realized I'm kicking myself right now.
[00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:30.076]  I meant to find our place and come back.
[00:15:30.469 --> 00:15:34.092]  I'm going to look around for this police vehicle that I saw.
[00:15:34.092 --> 00:15:37.735]  But again, it was just raining and sleeting so hard.
[00:15:37.735 --> 00:15:40.297]  And I was wearing just a regular shirt.
[00:15:40.297 --> 00:15:41.698]  Had to go get changed and come back.
[00:15:41.698 --> 00:15:44.060]  By the time we did, they were gone.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.981]  And the weather report said it was going to be 60 here.
[00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:47.002]  It was about 35.
[00:15:47.002 --> 00:15:52.366]  And just absolutely bone-chilling with 40-mile-an-hour winds.
[00:15:52.366 --> 00:15:54.248]  When we were out here, we almost ran into some elk.
[00:15:54.761 --> 00:15:56.302]  Driving, so thanks for everybody's prayers.
[00:15:56.302 --> 00:16:00.905]  We narrowly missed jumping out in front of us on the little lonely road.
[00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:03.327]  You may drive 10 miles before you see a house out here.
[00:16:03.327 --> 00:16:04.767]  You get to the town of Hardin.
[00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:06.369]  It's a pretty big-sized town.
[00:16:06.369 --> 00:16:10.071]  There's some mining operations going on here in the town.
[00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:13.873]  There's a granary running here in the town.
[00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:16.815]  We drove in at night with the smokestacks running.
[00:16:16.815 --> 00:16:20.057]  So, it's just very, very surreal here in the town of Hardin.
[00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:20.918]  But Jason Burmess,
[00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:24.233]  You've heard my basic breakdown on this coming up in about two hours.
[00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.156]  We're going to give you a full report with Steve Quayle coming up in about an hour.
[00:16:27.156 --> 00:16:31.259]  We're going to have Michael Hollingsworth, who I've found to be absolutely dead on with his analysis.
[00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:33.661]  We'll hook up with him later today.
[00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:35.242]  But, Jason Bermas, give me your take on what
[00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:42.076]  Well I think it's just unbelievable and this is the top story over at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:45.917]  Exposed, American Police Force is a Blackwater front group.
[00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:55.300]  APF scrambles to delete webpage admitting it runs Blackwater, controlled US training center, proving the two organizations are one and the same.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:09.009]  I never thought I would see the day, Alex, where they're not only setting up FEMA camps, but they're doing so with a privatized military force as notorious as Blackwater, and just telling people it doesn't exist!
[00:17:09.009 --> 00:17:21.197]  Well, absolutely, and remember, Blackwater became Blackwater Worldwide three years ago, then it became XC because their old name, with the murder charges, the hit charges, the rape charges against their own people and children,
[00:17:21.653 --> 00:17:23.274]  Coming out in federal court.
[00:17:23.274 --> 00:17:26.395]  They moved offshore, but they are opening a training center in Southern California.
[00:17:26.395 --> 00:17:27.495]  They're opening others.
[00:17:27.495 --> 00:17:30.796]  And remember, we need Watson to get on this, because I just remembered this.
[00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:37.619]  They were hiring Eastern European, Serb, Czech Republic mercs as their main force now.
[00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:42.480]  And I remember them hiring Brazilian and Argentinian.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.663]  Some of the Pinochet's old commandos got hired with entire squads, in some cases up to brigade strength.
[00:17:49.663 --> 00:17:50.463]  I remember that report.
[00:17:51.323 --> 00:17:53.683]  A year ago, we need to pull those up and put that in.
[00:17:53.683 --> 00:17:55.404]  So this is Blackwater's classic MO.
[00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:57.724]  They have a lot of subsidiaries.
[00:17:57.724 --> 00:18:03.105]  And remember, ladies and gentlemen, Blackwater's now in federal court for murdering people that got in the way of their contracts.
[00:18:03.105 --> 00:18:07.966]  There's been a lot of mercenary groups killing people en masse, and even military investigators in Iraq.
[00:18:07.966 --> 00:18:11.907]  I'm not trying to scare people, but this, I didn't think this was too dangerous of a mission.
[00:18:11.907 --> 00:18:15.307]  Now I'm beginning to realize we're dealing with hardcore felon fear.
[00:18:15.307 --> 00:18:16.968]  And a Blackwater cutout, it appears.
[00:18:16.968 --> 00:18:18.708]  This is very dangerous for everybody's prayers.
[00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:27.172]  On this here, we're about to go in and start asking questions and start going up and demanding to speak with some of these people and to get them on the record.
[00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:34.860]  So I'm going to let you get back to what you're doing, covering all the flu, opening the phones up, Michael Hollingsworth coming up, Steve Will coming up, and in one hour and 40 minutes,
[00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:43.684]  I will be giving you the latest report, maybe about 1 hour 45 and 1 hour 50, a little bit into the third hour today.
[00:18:43.684 --> 00:18:58.168]  Continual reporting from the front lines of the Info War in occupied Hartin, Montana with a black site, ghost site FEMA camp operated by Blackwater Cutouts run by CERB and other Eastern European Merck groups along with British and Germans.
[00:18:58.168 --> 00:18:59.408]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:01.863]  Thank you so much, Alex, and stay safe.
[00:19:01.863 --> 00:19:05.704]  And, you know, we always told people that they would blow out the economy first.
[00:19:05.704 --> 00:19:11.367]  They would go after the most economically depressed areas and move these FEMA camps in.
[00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:17.449]  And notice it's in a rural area where the mainstream media will not pick up on it except for the locals.
[00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:24.612]  You'll probably see this two weeks, maybe a month down the line because of the coverage that InfoWars is giving you on it.
[00:19:24.912 --> 00:19:25.912]  But think about it, folks.
[00:19:25.912 --> 00:19:31.454]  We now have confirmation that the man that's heading this up is a multiple felon.
[00:19:31.454 --> 00:19:32.934]  And that's not Jason Burmess.
[00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:35.535]  That's BillingsGazette.com.
[00:19:35.535 --> 00:19:39.436]  We're going to read the article on the other side and so much more.
[00:19:39.436 --> 00:19:41.897]  Alex Jones needs your prayers, needs your support.
[00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:44.618]  He'll be back in about 90 minutes to give us an update.
[00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:45.878]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:45.878 --> 00:19:47.439]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:48.559]  InfoWars.com.
[00:20:00.612 --> 00:20:03.996]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:07.900]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.624]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.624 --> 00:20:18.672]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:26.776]  These are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:31.618]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.

[00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:03.764]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:09.810]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.631]  That's right.
[00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:13.474]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.474 --> 00:21:20.402]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:20.962 --> 00:21:29.089]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:34.573]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:40.378]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:40.378 --> 00:21:44.501]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:44.881 --> 00:21:45.162]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:47.145]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:47.145 --> 00:21:47.746]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.746 --> 00:21:48.026]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:04.220]  It's here.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.384]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:22:09.384 --> 00:22:17.010]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:17.708 --> 00:22:25.153]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:36.901]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:40.864]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:40.864 --> 00:22:43.125]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:46.968]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:23:47.638 --> 00:23:49.218]  The best filtered water in the world.
[00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:11.519]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:17.382]  Alex in the trenches in Hardin, Montana at the confirmed privatized FEMA camp.
[00:24:17.382 --> 00:24:20.803]  And again, we always warned you they'd blow the economy out first.
[00:24:20.803 --> 00:24:23.384]  There would be turmoil in the United States.
[00:24:23.384 --> 00:24:28.406]  And then in the background, they'd set up these nice little FEMA camps where you're going to be encouraged to go.
[00:24:28.406 --> 00:24:30.627]  And yes, they're going to take over the police force.
[00:24:30.627 --> 00:24:33.248]  And by the way, they're not going to be actual law enforcement.
[00:24:33.248 --> 00:24:37.590]  They'll be former military intelligence and former analysts.
[00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.391]  And by the way, they won't be from this country.
[00:24:40.091 --> 00:24:42.832]  And they'll be headed up by foreigners.
[00:24:42.832 --> 00:24:47.052]  And people thought that this was so nightmarish, so outlandish, that it could never occur.
[00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:50.233]  Yet it's happening in this country today.
[00:24:50.233 --> 00:24:51.233]  Today.
[00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:52.493]  It is a reality.
[00:24:52.493 --> 00:24:55.034]  And we're going to read this out of the BillingsGazette.com.
[00:24:55.034 --> 00:24:58.515]  More analysis over at PrisonPlan.com and Infowars.com right now.
[00:24:58.515 --> 00:25:04.776]  The headline is, APF American Police Force Head Hilton Has History of Legal Trouble.
[00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:06.880]  And that's putting it lightly.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.784]  That headline is about as softball as it gets when you start reading this article.
[00:25:11.784 --> 00:25:14.827]  I'm just going to read you a few different subsections here.
[00:25:14.827 --> 00:25:23.135]  Public records from police and state and federal courts in California show that Michael Anthony Hilton, using that name and more than a dozen
[00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.603]  Aliases over several years.
[00:25:25.603 --> 00:25:27.704]  Forget about three or four aliases.
[00:25:27.704 --> 00:25:29.125]  Try a dozen.
[00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:42.554]  A dozen aliases over several years is cited in multiple criminal, civil, and bankruptcy cases, and was sentenced in 1993 to two years in the state penitentiary of California.
[00:25:43.598 --> 00:25:49.206]  And if he got convicted and brought up on dozens of charges, think about what he's gotten away with.
[00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:56.696]  This is a hardened criminal, folks, and obviously a very connected hardened criminal, or he wouldn't be in the position that he is today.
[00:25:56.696 --> 00:25:57.977]  Hilton pleaded guilty!
[00:25:58.618 --> 00:26:03.521]  You see, when you know people, there's some backdoor shenanigans that can get you out of screwing people out of money.
[00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:06.182]  Because obviously this guy works for the military-industrial complex.
[00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:36.708]  He wouldn't be heading up what seems to be a black-water front in Hardin, Montana, as we speak, if he didn't have those type of connections.
[00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:45.136]  Court records in the case list the real name as Michael Hilton, but they also include the aliases Midrag Iliadakovic and Michael Mirodrag.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.725]  Hilton, who speaks heavily accented English, has told reporters that he is a naturalized U.S.
[00:26:54.725 --> 00:27:02.792]  citizen originally from Montenegro, a country bordering Serbia, and once part of the former Republic of Yugoslavia.
[00:27:02.792 --> 00:27:13.120]  Court documents in this case allege that Hilton and others solicited investments of hundreds of thousands of dollars from the plaintiff for the creation of a collectible Super Bowl commemorative coin.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.483]  So this guy's a scam artist and a hardened criminal.
[00:27:17.003 --> 00:27:18.924]  And again, this is the Billings Gazette.
[00:27:18.924 --> 00:27:20.885]  This is the local newspaper.
[00:27:20.885 --> 00:27:24.327]  How much longer until the media begins to report on this?
[00:27:24.327 --> 00:27:26.309]  Where are you?
[00:27:26.309 --> 00:27:34.814]  We are in a desperate situation for this to become exposed in a time of mandatory vaccinations across the country.
[00:27:34.814 --> 00:27:35.915]  And they are mandatory, folks.
[00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:37.776]  We're going to get to that in just a moment.
[00:27:37.776 --> 00:27:41.118]  We're going to go over Abilene, Texas, the school system.
[00:27:41.949 --> 00:27:42.189]  What's
[00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:03.980]  Swine flu vaccine.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.461]  Again, it's not really swine flu.
[00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:07.203]  It's three different types of flu.
[00:28:07.203 --> 00:28:11.286]  You have the H1N1, which is the pig flu, the virus.
[00:28:11.286 --> 00:28:14.889]  Then you have the H5N1, which is the bird flu, which is part of that as well.
[00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:18.352]  And then you have the human flu virus, that this is all mixed together.
[00:28:19.872 --> 00:28:24.773]  And they're saying no, no, no, and you're only seeing local stories about it.
[00:28:24.773 --> 00:28:31.535]  Because again, Barack Obama gets up on the television and he says, no, we're not going to do any mandatory vaccinations.
[00:28:31.535 --> 00:28:33.415]  It is literally out of 1984.
[00:28:33.415 --> 00:28:36.336]  It is Orwellian doublespeak.
[00:28:36.336 --> 00:28:39.276]  They are doing it across the country.
[00:28:39.276 --> 00:28:46.258]  And big ups to the people in Albany that are fighting this and saying no and trying to expose the fact that there is no need to take this vaccination.
[00:28:47.816 --> 00:28:51.898]  Meanwhile, our country just tumbles into communism.
[00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:56.840]  It's the 60th anniversary of Mao, and of course they're having parades in China.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:05.224]  He's such a great leader, but what really disturbs me is that the Empire State Building in New York City was lit up with Chinese colors.
[00:29:05.224 --> 00:29:08.746]  Does this tell you that we are moving towards a dictatorship?
[00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:10.267]  Towards globalization?
[00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:12.848]  Towards a quote-unquote one world order?
[00:29:14.244 --> 00:29:16.827]  You know, if you said this five years ago, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:29:16.827 --> 00:29:30.104]  If you say it now, you can type it into Google, you hit the news button, and all of a sudden there are dozens of stories daily about how the G20 is ringing in a new world order, or how Chavez wants to work with Barack Obama towards a new world order.
[00:29:30.104 --> 00:29:32.407]  These are the headlines in the mainstream media today!
[00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:38.458]  We'll be back after this covering all the latest vaccination news and of course Hardin, Montana with Alex Jones.
[00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:39.439]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:39.439 --> 00:29:40.879]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:50.884]  All the latest over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:50.884 --> 00:29:52.285]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.285 --> 00:29:54.806]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:57.467]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.796 --> 00:30:03.817]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.817 --> 00:30:09.139]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:11.180]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.181]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.362]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.362 --> 00:30:18.102]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.482 --> 00:30:20.362]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:21.443]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:23.643]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.643 --> 00:30:24.984]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.984 --> 00:30:26.504]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.504 --> 00:30:31.765]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:35.366]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:38.827]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.187 --> 00:30:40.407]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:41.308]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:42.408]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.408 --> 00:30:43.349]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:44.449]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.449 --> 00:30:47.490]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.611]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.611 --> 00:30:51.772]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:51.772 --> 00:30:55.053]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.707 --> 00:31:14.270]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:20.812]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.833]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:25.334]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.334 --> 00:31:36.298]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:36.926 --> 00:31:38.588]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.588 --> 00:31:40.449]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.449 --> 00:31:47.356]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.356 --> 00:31:55.623]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.623 --> 00:31:57.205]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.205 --> 00:31:58.386]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.098 --> 00:32:05.400]  Food security from eFoods Direct, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.901]  It's a scary world we live in.
[00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:11.264]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[00:32:11.264 --> 00:32:14.966]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:22.770]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.732]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[00:32:26.732 --> 00:32:30.794]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoods
[00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:31.274]  We're good to go!
[00:33:16.567 --> 00:33:23.490]  Before we go to your calls, we're going to be going to your calls all through this segment, and we get into the H1N1 vaccine.
[00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:28.752]  I want to read this story out of Global Security Newswire.
[00:33:28.752 --> 00:33:32.434]  Federal court backs Pentagon anthrax vaccination program.
[00:33:32.434 --> 00:33:37.616]  Remember, they tried to have mandatory vaccinations based on the anthrax attacks shortly after 9-11.
[00:33:37.616 --> 00:33:38.756]  So many people refused.
[00:33:38.756 --> 00:33:44.679]  The police officers, the firefighters, the health workers said, no, I'm not taking this, and they had to back off.
[00:33:45.421 --> 00:33:47.222]  But they're not backing off now.
[00:33:47.222 --> 00:33:48.302]  Eight U.S.
[00:33:48.302 --> 00:33:56.465]  Defense Department personnel have lost another round in their legal fight against mandatory anthrax vaccinations, the Associated Press reported yesterday.
[00:33:56.465 --> 00:33:56.845]  The U.S.
[00:33:56.845 --> 00:34:09.469]  Court of Appeals in Washington declined to overturn a lower court's move to dismiss a lawsuit claiming that the Food and Drug Administration had wrongfully found that an existing vaccine would provide adequate protection from inhaled anthrax bacteria.
[00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:20.678]  We are presented with a scientific judgment by the FDA to which we owe considerable deference, the court said, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the vaccine was not effective.
[00:34:20.678 --> 00:34:22.958]  You see how this works?
[00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:27.960]  They're putting it on eight military personnel to prove that the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.001]  They're not putting it on behest of the FDA to prove that it does work.
[00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:33.881]  They're saying, prove it doesn't work!
[00:34:33.881 --> 00:34:35.962]  And that's how things go along.
[00:34:36.923 --> 00:34:37.624]  Slowly.
[00:34:37.624 --> 00:34:38.666]  Incrementally.
[00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:43.192]  And that's why we're going to have mandatory vaccinations within this week, by the way.
[00:34:43.192 --> 00:34:46.137]  This story came out, I believe, two days ago.
[00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:47.339]  For the military.
[00:34:48.683 --> 00:34:50.265]  Regarding the swine flu, let's read this one.
[00:35:07.507 --> 00:35:20.218]  Also told the Associated Press that as many as 400 troops are ready to go to five regional headquarters across the country to assist federal health and emergency management officials if needed as the flu season heats up.
[00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:25.523]  The Pentagon has bought 2.7 million!
[00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:31.028]  2.7 million vaccines and 1.4 million of those will go to active-duty military.
[00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:32.109]  Let's stop right there.
[00:35:33.234 --> 00:35:37.555]  The United States population around 300 million.
[00:35:37.555 --> 00:35:41.616]  1.4 million military personnel about to take the vaccine.
[00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:45.137]  That's roughly one in every 275 people.
[00:35:45.137 --> 00:35:47.838]  That does not include non-military personnel.
[00:35:47.838 --> 00:36:02.262]  That does not include the children now being vaccinated at their schools which are now makeshift mass vaccination centers where they also expect to get the parents, the friends, and the family of these students.
[00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:11.698]  National Guard troops on active duty are also required to receive the vaccine, as are civilian Defense Department employees who are in critical jobs.
[00:36:11.698 --> 00:36:12.558]  Let me repeat that.
[00:36:12.558 --> 00:36:17.223]  That's not just active Army, active Marines, active Navy.
[00:36:17.223 --> 00:36:23.528]  No, the National Guard are going to be required to take this shot as well, as well as Defense Department personnel.
[00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:29.593]  As a result, the military is expected to provide health officials with an early assessment of the vaccine.
[00:36:29.593 --> 00:36:32.114]  Oh yeah, they're going to give out an early assessment.
[00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:38.739]  Folks, the media is doing everything they can to try to cover up the young girl who died of a Gardasil shot this week.
[00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:41.801]  That young girl died two hours after taking the shot.
[00:36:41.801 --> 00:36:46.143]  And you know what the headline is over in the UK, over at The Guardian, over at The Telegraph?
[00:36:46.143 --> 00:36:51.107]  They're now trying to tell people that she magically died from a malignant tumor in her chest.
[00:36:51.667 --> 00:37:00.676]  Now even if it's true that she had a malignant tumor in her chest, the chances of her dying from that tumor two hours after taking a Gardasil shot are beyond belief.
[00:37:01.701 --> 00:37:03.742]  But that doesn't stop the hype in the United States.
[00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:06.002]  First of all, the United States barely reported on it.
[00:37:06.002 --> 00:37:07.783]  You didn't see it on Fox News.
[00:37:07.783 --> 00:37:10.443]  You didn't see it on MSNBC.
[00:37:10.443 --> 00:37:14.884]  You did see it on The Guardian, The Telegraph, Sky News over in the UK.
[00:37:14.884 --> 00:37:19.546]  You first saw it when US News & World Report did a hit piece saying, oh no, it couldn't be the shot.
[00:37:19.546 --> 00:37:22.986]  And remember, the Associated Press and Reuters prepared you for this.
[00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:31.872]  By saying that the swine flu shot was going to be blamed on all sorts of abnormal deaths and conditions.
[00:37:31.872 --> 00:37:33.633]  But it won't actually be the shot.
[00:37:33.633 --> 00:37:37.216]  It will be overly paranoid people.
[00:37:37.216 --> 00:37:41.039]  Folks, in 1976 when they did this to people, what happened?
[00:37:41.039 --> 00:37:41.779]  People died.
[00:37:41.779 --> 00:37:43.580]  People got Gilliam's Bear.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.562]  Made them quadriplegics.
[00:37:45.562 --> 00:37:48.724]  They lost muscle motion in their mouths.
[00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:49.625]  Permanent damage.
[00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:52.087]  They were in leg braces the rest of their life.
[00:37:52.087 --> 00:37:53.488]  They lost lawsuits.
[00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:58.792]  But it doesn't matter that George Wallace in 60 Minutes reported on it in 1979.
[00:37:58.792 --> 00:38:00.032]  We'll just repeat history.
[00:38:00.032 --> 00:38:07.054]  It doesn't matter that Gerald Ford read the same script that Barack Obama and his administration is currently reading.
[00:38:07.054 --> 00:38:08.114]  It still flies on.
[00:38:08.114 --> 00:38:09.554]  It still moves forward.
[00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:10.734]  It's just disgusting.
[00:38:10.734 --> 00:38:14.915]  Again, military to get mandatory swine flu shots soon.
[00:38:14.915 --> 00:38:16.916]  And they're not stopping at the swine flu.
[00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:18.776]  They're going to try to give them the anthrax shot as well.
[00:38:21.058 --> 00:38:28.021]  And before we get into Albany and their courageous effort to stop the shot, saying, no, we're not going to take it, we're health workers, we know this isn't good.
[00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:31.502]  Viewer faced lockout for failing to get vaccination.
[00:38:31.502 --> 00:38:35.604]  This is out of reporternews.com in Abilene, Texas.
[00:38:35.604 --> 00:38:40.546]  As hours passed Wednesday, the number of kindergartners, kindergartners, these are five-year-old children.
[00:38:40.546 --> 00:38:42.367]  Their brains aren't even fully developed yet.
[00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:44.557]  Five-year-olds.
[00:38:44.557 --> 00:38:50.901]  The number of kindergartners and seventh graders in Abilene Independent School District and Wiley ISD.
[00:38:50.901 --> 00:38:52.522]  Still in need of mandatory vaccinations.
[00:38:52.522 --> 00:38:53.842]  Continue to dwindle.
[00:38:53.842 --> 00:38:56.024]  See, they're putting pressure on.
[00:38:56.024 --> 00:38:57.284]  Your kid doesn't have it yet?
[00:38:57.284 --> 00:38:58.045]  He needs to have it.
[00:38:58.045 --> 00:39:00.086]  He can't come back to school until he gets it.
[00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:09.392]  Consequently, fewer students faced being turned away at school today for failing to meet new state vaccination guidelines for kindergarten and seventh graders.
[00:39:09.392 --> 00:39:11.113]  They put the mandatory language!
[00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:18.559]  In this article, they openly admit that you're going to be turned away from your school if you don't take the shot.
[00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:24.383]  Right here, but they're saying fewer and fewer of them are being turned away because they're taking the shot!
[00:39:24.383 --> 00:39:29.186]  The Texas Department of Health had set today as the deadline for students to be in compliance.
[00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:37.512]  Students in those grades could be allowed in classroom today, however, if they have received exemptions for medical, religious, and consensuous reasons.
[00:39:37.512 --> 00:39:40.494]  So in other words, they're admitting that you really don't have to take the shot
[00:39:40.734 --> 00:39:47.179]  And the mandatory language is only there to spook you out and try to force you into taking this vaccination.
[00:39:47.179 --> 00:39:53.003]  Roughly 250 AISD students in those grades, down from more than 400 on Friday.
[00:39:53.003 --> 00:40:00.008]  See, they spooked another 150 students out within a week by saying it's mandatory, you need it, you can't come back to school.
[00:40:00.008 --> 00:40:07.714]  And 30 Wiley ISD students in the two grades, down from 45, there's another 15, so 165 more children were forced to take the poison.
[00:40:08.394 --> 00:40:08.775]  Let me see.
[00:40:08.775 --> 00:40:09.295]  Let me repeat this.
[00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:26.633]  Charles Perkins needs a few emails and phone calls, folks.
[00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:34.699]  He needs to be let know that we shouldn't be vaccinating the children against something as ridiculous, as hyped up, as non-lethal as the swine flu.
[00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:46.889]  And I'm seeing more and more deaths, but as every single time, I believe a 14-year-old died of quote-unquote the swine flu, and then you find out that this 14-year-old had chronic conditions throughout the past few months and years.
[00:40:48.066 --> 00:40:49.347]  That's what always happens.
[00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:51.788]  It always seems to have, you know, they have gout.
[00:40:51.788 --> 00:40:53.249]  They have a chronic heart condition.
[00:40:53.249 --> 00:40:54.289]  But what do they do?
[00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:57.331]  The headline is death from swine flu.
[00:40:57.331 --> 00:40:58.552]  Death from swine flu.
[00:40:58.552 --> 00:41:00.273]  That's the hype.
[00:41:00.273 --> 00:41:04.855]  The military industrial complex is making money hand over fist on this.
[00:41:04.855 --> 00:41:10.358]  They're running a psychological operation on the entire populace as well as a eugenics operation.
[00:41:12.108 --> 00:41:14.669]  Talk about killing two birds with one stone.
[00:41:14.669 --> 00:41:16.790]  They're killing three birds with one stone with that one.
[00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:24.432]  Parents of students without proper immunizations in Abilene ISD and Wiley ISD will be called if the students arrive at school unattended.
[00:41:24.432 --> 00:41:31.374]  Wiley Superintendent Joey Light said students absent proper immunizations will be required to wait for their parents in the library.
[00:41:31.374 --> 00:41:35.796]  In Abilene ISD, Perkins said students likely will wait in the school clinic.
[00:41:35.796 --> 00:41:35.976]  See?
[00:41:36.616 --> 00:41:38.337]  They're going to put him in a room.
[00:41:38.337 --> 00:41:39.458]  They're going to hype it up again.
[00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:41.659]  They're going to tell the parents how bad they are.
[00:41:41.659 --> 00:41:49.564]  Before the parents get there, they're going to say, well, you know, if your mom and dad would just wise up and you just took the shot, you could go back to class, Joey.
[00:41:49.564 --> 00:41:51.525]  You could go see your friends, Jimmy.
[00:41:51.525 --> 00:41:52.405]  You hear that, Jennifer?
[00:41:52.405 --> 00:41:53.306]  Don't you want to eat lunch?
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:00.202]  Students will be allowed to make up missed assignments, Abilene ISD and Wiley ISD, Light and Perkins said.
[00:42:00.202 --> 00:42:06.146]  At this time, AISD is considering this as an excused absence.
[00:42:06.146 --> 00:42:08.487]  They will be allowed to make up their work if they have assignments.
[00:42:08.487 --> 00:42:10.808]  They could certainly work on them at home.
[00:42:10.808 --> 00:42:15.711]  If the individual case becomes extended, campuses would handle this as they would any absence.
[00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:16.891]  So in other words, it won't be
[00:42:18.072 --> 00:42:19.474]  Excused at some point.
[00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:29.704]  One potential problem for students without required immunizations, Perkins said, is a Texas Education Agency prohibition against missing 10 school days during a semester and not receiving credit because of it.
[00:42:29.704 --> 00:42:35.650]  So they're also saying, look, if you're gone more than 10 days, there's a chance you're going to have to repeat the grade.
[00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.652]  Take the shot!
[00:42:37.652 --> 00:42:40.975]  You don't want to have to spend another year in first grade or kindergarten, do you?
[00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:41.836]  Take the shot!
[00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:49.304]  This is just disgusting and hopefully we'll be posting it at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv shortly.
[00:42:49.304 --> 00:42:51.045]  It goes on and on.
[00:42:51.045 --> 00:42:57.708]  But if you think these mandatory vaccinations are a myth, they're all over the local mainstream media.
[00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:02.731]  And the national media seems to be silent on this Albany issue.
[00:43:02.731 --> 00:43:05.112]  Health workers to state, stick it!
[00:43:06.044 --> 00:43:09.967]  Okay, they're having rallies outside of the state capitol in Albany.
[00:43:09.967 --> 00:43:23.618]  Formaldehyde, mercury, and squalene may sound like ingredients in some kind of toxic chemistry experiment, but these are actually what can be found in the H1N1 flu vaccine, which should be made available to the public next week.
[00:43:24.571 --> 00:43:27.434]  This is off the TroyRecord.com, folks.
[00:43:27.434 --> 00:43:31.597]  Again, local mainstream media not afraid to report this.
[00:43:31.597 --> 00:43:36.982]  Because if you look at it, there are dozens of people out there with signs that say, stop selling the illusion of a pandemic.
[00:43:36.982 --> 00:43:40.245]  No mandatory H1N1 flu vaccines.
[00:43:40.245 --> 00:43:42.226]  And this is about as hardcore as it gets.
[00:43:42.226 --> 00:43:45.870]  Starting off with the three most poisonous items in the vaccine.
[00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.452]  Formaldehyde, mercury, and squalene.
[00:43:49.847 --> 00:44:03.911]  It is partially because of the presence of those toxins that nearly 500 people rallied in the Capitol Tuesday against the State Department of Health, mandating that health care workers should be vaccinated for the swine flu by the end of November.
[00:44:03.911 --> 00:44:07.912]  If they don't comply, these medical professionals could lose their jobs.
[00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:19.772]  I'm worried about what is the vaccination itself, but I'm especially worried that my freedom of choice has been taken away from me, said Andrea Schofield, a nuclear medicine technologist who drove from Rochester to attend the protest.
[00:44:19.772 --> 00:44:21.993]  And that's no short drive, that's about four hours away.
[00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:25.714]  We want a choice, but still be able to keep our jobs!
[00:44:25.714 --> 00:44:37.917]  Schofield said that she received a letter last week from Unity Hospital, where she works, which stated that all hospital employees, this is Unity Hospital in Rochester, folks, had to get the shot or become unemployed.
[00:44:38.237 --> 00:44:40.278]  But that's not a mandatory vaccination!
[00:44:40.278 --> 00:44:41.459]  Give me a break!
[00:44:41.459 --> 00:44:48.283]  But in lieu of this, she said educating the public and healthcare workers on preventing the flu would be a better course of action.
[00:44:48.283 --> 00:45:00.431]  At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, just an hour after the conclusion of the rally, with the State Department of Health Commissioner Richard Daines, explained that it was up to individual institutions on what would happen with individuals who refuse the shot.
[00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:07.135]  In other words, not saying, you can't fire these people, but giving a wink-wink, of course you're going to fire them if they don't take the shot.
[00:45:08.493 --> 00:45:19.338]  This could lead to termination or suspension if the entire medical institution refused to give the vaccination in the state and would do an investigation and determine a plan of correction.
[00:45:19.338 --> 00:45:25.601]  Usually about 30-50% of healthcare workers voluntarily get the normal seasonal flu vaccine.
[00:45:25.601 --> 00:45:34.024]  So 3-5 out of 10, and that's a hyped up number, it's probably more like 10% to 30%, 1 out of 10 to 3 out of 10 actually take the regular flu shot.
[00:45:34.024 --> 00:45:34.925]  But they have to hype it up!
[00:45:35.953 --> 00:45:42.295]  So they have to doctor the numbers and say, oh, well, almost half of them already take the regular flu shot that has thimerosal on it.
[00:45:42.295 --> 00:45:44.416]  Again, we've shown you the scans.
[00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:46.456]  They always try, oh, mercury-free, mercury-free.
[00:45:46.456 --> 00:45:54.739]  And remember, they're trying to push this not only on your school children, the kindergartners to seventh graders we just read about, but pregnant women as well.
[00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:57.399]  How disturbed are these people?
[00:45:57.399 --> 00:45:58.680]  All right, I said I'd jump to calls.
[00:45:59.645 --> 00:46:01.805]  Let's take a couple right now before the break.
[00:46:01.805 --> 00:46:05.406]  Let's go to Mike in Connecticut, I believe?
[00:46:05.406 --> 00:46:05.966]  Mike, you're online.
[00:46:05.966 --> 00:46:08.127]  Yeah, how's it going, Jason?
[00:46:08.127 --> 00:46:09.647]  Good.
[00:46:09.647 --> 00:46:14.008]  Yeah, actually, I talked to Alex a couple days ago and about the swine flu.
[00:46:14.008 --> 00:46:29.391]  I live right next to a hospital, Yukon Health Center, and I've seen, and I have so many of you, tons and tons of military vehicles coming down to Farmington, a small suburban town, and the Yukon police department over there has been training with the state police and been training with the National Guard.
[00:46:30.183 --> 00:46:36.566]  And they're trying to say, oh no, it's just precautious in case people start freaking out they can't get the swine flu.
[00:46:36.566 --> 00:46:38.206]  Like you say, give me a break!
[00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:44.269]  This whole thing is nothing but... So you're telling me, and this is also happening in Farmington, Connecticut, that there are U.S.
[00:46:44.269 --> 00:46:52.652]  military on the streets assisting the police under the guise that people are going to freak out during this pandemic and demand the swine flu shot?
[00:46:54.738 --> 00:46:55.538]  We're good to go.
[00:47:13.871 --> 00:47:35.896]  Well, we need people out in Farmington, Connecticut to take video and photographs of this, post it on YouTube, and then email it to us at robd at infowars.com and articles at infowars.com so we can immediately post this, because obviously this is going to be going on all around the country, especially now that the vaccine is supposed to be readily available within the week.
[00:47:35.896 --> 00:47:37.296]  I thank you for the call, Mike.
[00:47:37.296 --> 00:47:39.197]  Let's jump to Rodney in Texas.
[00:47:39.197 --> 00:47:39.917]  Rodney, you're on the line.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.544]  Hey Burmese, thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:45.544 --> 00:48:07.121]  Forgive me if I'm being redundant here, but I had read a story a couple of days ago out of Toronto Globe and Mail about this big scientist up there who submitted a report saying that anybody who took this swine flu shot were two and a half times likely, more likely, to catch the swine flu.
[00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:07.462]  And so
[00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:25.319]  A great portion of a lot of the provinces up in Canada are suspending making it mandatory for people to take the shot because of the controversy that has been stirred up by this report from this scientist from
[00:48:28.234 --> 00:48:34.857]  Well I gotta tell you it's not a shock that you would be two and a half more times more likely to get the swine flu if you take the shot.
[00:48:34.857 --> 00:48:46.402]  The Mayo Clinic did a study I believe it was about three to four months ago where they admitted if you took the regular seasonal flu shot that you were two to three times more likely to actually get the flu.
[00:48:46.402 --> 00:48:47.483]  So why would you take these
[00:48:47.503 --> 00:48:48.544]  And I agree with you.
[00:48:48.544 --> 00:48:51.926]  Our mainstream media has said nothing about what's going on up there.
[00:48:51.926 --> 00:48:53.847]  Look, more than half of that two-thirds of that country
[00:49:17.096 --> 00:49:24.621]  They're saying that they're not going to make people take this shot, and mainly because of this report.
[00:49:24.621 --> 00:49:31.546]  They're trying to come up with some type of propaganda to try to counteract this report that the scientists submitted.
[00:49:31.546 --> 00:49:41.973]  But it's got people up there in Canada absolutely scared, not just the people, but a lot of the authorities, because the report is based on
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:50.066]  Actual facts, which is, you know, seems like... Well, all we do here at InfoWars and Prison Planet is report on the actual facts.
[00:49:50.066 --> 00:49:54.569]  If we're talking about it, it's somewhere buried in the mainstream consciousness.
[00:49:54.569 --> 00:49:56.931]  It's being reported on by the local media.
[00:49:56.931 --> 00:49:58.412]  The studies have been done.
[00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:01.194]  It's unfortunate that the New York Times won't pick up on it.
[00:50:01.194 --> 00:50:04.136]  That the Washington Post refuses to discuss it.
[00:50:04.136 --> 00:50:06.378]  That it won't be on Fox News or MSNBC.
[00:50:06.698 --> 00:50:08.879]  That CNN headline news won't touch it.
[00:50:08.879 --> 00:50:19.106]  They'll just put Sanjay Gupta up there, CFR member and Bilderberg attendee and almost a Obama administration appointee.
[00:50:19.106 --> 00:50:21.247]  He at the last minute didn't take the job.
[00:50:21.247 --> 00:50:23.668]  I believe it was the Surgeon General's position.
[00:50:23.668 --> 00:50:26.730]  But he'll tell you all day, you need to take this vaccine.
[00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:32.314]  Remember they were trying to hype up that we needed to take three vaccinations and then they kind of pulled back and said, you know what?
[00:50:32.314 --> 00:50:33.995]  One vaccination might just be enough.
[00:50:34.974 --> 00:50:36.715]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[00:50:36.715 --> 00:50:39.817]  Omari, Larry, Chase, Phillip, and much more.
[00:50:39.817 --> 00:50:41.138]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:47.622]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in Alex in Hardin, Montana right now, reporting live throughout the program.
[00:50:47.622 --> 00:50:50.584]  Go check it out over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.213]  Remain in your houses.
[00:51:04.213 --> 00:51:09.981]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:11.342]  Will they do it?
[00:51:11.342 --> 00:51:13.946]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:19.914]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:51:20.393 --> 00:51:22.594]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:51:22.594 --> 00:51:26.876]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:51:26.876 --> 00:51:31.759]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:36.661]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:51:36.661 --> 00:51:41.484]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:51:42.404 --> 00:51:50.829]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:53.331]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:56.392]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[00:51:56.392 --> 00:52:00.615]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:52:00.615 --> 00:52:07.299]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.299 --> 00:52:08.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:11.469]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.469 --> 00:52:12.290]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:13.250]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.650]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.631]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.631 --> 00:52:23.773]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:24.253]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.253 --> 00:52:29.935]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.615 --> 00:52:34.118]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.118 --> 00:52:36.920]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:02.286]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:53:02.286 --> 00:53:04.776]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:53:05.774 --> 00:53:19.223]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[00:53:19.223 --> 00:53:30.811]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:34.694]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:53:34.694 --> 00:53:42.580]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:48.124]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:51.267]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:53:51.267 --> 00:53:54.229]  Call toll-free 888-KO-GERMS.
[00:53:54.229 --> 00:53:56.892]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:53:56.892 --> 00:53:58.373]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:53:58.373 --> 00:53:59.634]  This call could save your life.
[00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:12.039]  Huge breaking news handed to me during the break.
[00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:13.601]  We're gonna get to that in just a moment.
[00:54:13.601 --> 00:54:15.082]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:15.082 --> 00:54:15.682]  Alex, of course,
[00:54:16.773 --> 00:54:34.789]  On the ground, getting first-hand intel over in Hardin, Montana, at the site of the FEMA camp, and the privatized Merck Run Squad, run by a foreign criminal, according to the Billings Gazette, and now other media outlets picking this up.
[00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:36.150]  We're going to get to it in a moment.
[00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.051]  Got to thank some of our sponsors.
[00:54:38.051 --> 00:54:40.754]  They're the people that make this show possible.
[00:54:40.754 --> 00:54:43.276]  Silverlungs.com, that's www.silverlungs.com.

[00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:10.581]  In a real crisis,
[00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.242]  What's the best weapon to have?
[00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.163]  It's food!

[00:55:31.152 --> 00:55:31.552]  We're good to go.
[00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:54.585]  On the APF story, and not only the APF story, but this Michael Hilton character.
[00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:59.389]  We're going to read this one out of the Associated Press first, and then get to this big USA Today story.
[00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:04.153]  Of course, we're going to have stories on this at PrisonPlanet and Infowars.com.
[00:56:04.153 --> 00:56:09.017]  Michael Hilton showed up to Hardin, Montana last week presenting himself as an economic savior.
[00:56:09.972 --> 00:56:21.020]  The man who would take over the town's $27 million dollar jail, empty since it was built as a development project in 2007, and provide 200 new jobs in the process.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:31.929]  He wore a military-style uniform, and has gestured to local law enforcement, offered up the use of three Mercedes SUVs, the black SUVs Alex was just talking about.
[00:56:32.859 --> 00:56:43.548]  But the man who styles himself as a military veteran turned private sector entrepreneur and California defense contractor with extensive government contracts also has another image.
[00:56:43.548 --> 00:56:48.832]  And that one is provided by public documents and interviews with associates and legal adversaries.
[00:56:50.455 --> 00:57:01.921]  The record says that he is a convicted felon with a number of aliases, a string of legal judgments against him, two bankruptcies, and a decades-long reputation for deals gone bad.
[00:57:01.921 --> 00:57:06.864]  American Police Force is the company Hilton formed in March to take over Hardin Jail.
[00:57:06.864 --> 00:57:09.746]  Privatized security from foreign mercs.
[00:57:11.192 --> 00:57:12.392]  And an admitted felon.
[00:57:12.392 --> 00:57:13.993]  This is unbelievable.
[00:57:13.993 --> 00:57:15.413]  Associated Press.
[00:57:15.413 --> 00:57:18.434]  It's over at thebostonherald.com right now.
[00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:22.456]  American Police Forces, the company Hilton formed in March to take over the Hardin Jail.
[00:57:22.456 --> 00:57:34.419]  Such schemes you cannot believe, said Joseph Carella, an Orange County, California doctor and co-defendant with Hilton in real estate fraud case that resulted in a civil judgment against Hilton and several others.
[00:57:34.419 --> 00:57:35.680]  The guy's brilliant.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.041]  If he had been able to do honest work, he probably would be a gazillionaire.
[00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:42.403]  But this guy's not into honest work.
[00:57:42.403 --> 00:57:43.764]  He's into the sleight of hand.
[00:57:43.764 --> 00:57:45.625]  He's into getting over on people.
[00:57:45.625 --> 00:57:46.586]  He's into control.
[00:57:46.586 --> 00:57:49.008]  He's into power.
[00:57:49.008 --> 00:57:57.014]  Court documents show Hilton has outstanding judgments against him in three civil cases totaling more than 1.1 million dollars!
[00:57:57.014 --> 00:58:01.477]  He's not only a convicted felon, he's a deadbeat who owes over a million!
[00:58:02.995 --> 00:58:11.864]  As for Hilton's military expertise, including his claim to be advised forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, those interviewed knew of no such feats.
[00:58:11.864 --> 00:58:21.414]  Instead, Hilton was described alternately by those who knew him as an arts dealer, a cook, a restaurant owner, a land developer, a loan broker, and a car salesman.
[00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:23.576]  Always with money-making schemes in the work.
[00:58:25.213 --> 00:58:26.233]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:27.554]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.316 --> 00:58:54.537]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.537 --> 00:58:56.557]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.557 --> 00:59:05.059]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.059 --> 00:59:10.621]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.621 --> 00:59:12.241]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:18.986]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:18.986 --> 00:59:30.055]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.055 --> 00:59:30.816]  That's right.
[00:59:30.816 --> 00:59:33.398]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.398 --> 00:59:35.199]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:35.199 --> 00:59:35.399]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:41.584 --> 00:59:44.726]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network Big Brother
[01:00:06.357 --> 01:00:08.139]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.139 --> 01:00:09.881]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:11.462]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.462 --> 01:00:13.024]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:17.228]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.228 --> 01:00:21.271]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:37.660]  Alex Jones on the ground in Hardin, Montana, where it is confirmed a privatized military force with connections to Blackwater being run by a multiple felon with over a dozen aliases.
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.681]  And this is breaking out into the mainstream.
[01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:44.624]  We're reading the Associated Press article out of the Boston Herald.com right now.
[01:00:44.624 --> 01:00:47.706]  USA Today also picking up on the story.
[01:00:48.246 --> 01:00:49.206]  Who brought it to you first?
[01:00:49.206 --> 01:00:52.988]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[01:00:52.988 --> 01:00:53.688]  Let's continue.
[01:00:53.688 --> 01:01:08.655]  When asked about court records detailing Hilton's past, this is the guy that is heading this up, Michael Hilton, although he seems to be from Serbia or right outside of Serbia, and that is not his real name, the documents speak for themselves.
[01:01:08.655 --> 01:01:11.796]  If anyone has found public documents, the documents are
[01:01:12.176 --> 01:01:13.017]  We're good to go.
[01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:35.987]  With American Police Force last month, the deal is worth more than 2.6 million dollars a year, according to city leaders.
[01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:38.629]  See, this is their 27 million dollar deal.
[01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:41.711]  It doesn't matter if felons are going to be running the state of Montana.
[01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:46.135]  That's okay with them, as long as they have a little money because they've blown out the economy.
[01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.456]  We need the government's help!
[01:01:49.898 --> 01:01:55.343]  Hilton has also pledged to build a $17 million military and law enforcement training center!
[01:01:55.343 --> 01:02:04.091]  And he's promised to dispatch security to patrol hardened streets, build an animal shelter and a homeless shelter, and offer free health care to city residents out of the jail's clinic!
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.583]  Those additional promises were not included in the jail agreement, which remains in limbo because U.S.
[01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:12.465]  Bank has so far declined to sign off on the contract.
[01:02:12.465 --> 01:02:16.608]  The bank and its trustees is in the bonds used to fund the jail.
[01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:16.969]  A U.S.
[01:02:16.969 --> 01:02:22.272]  Bank spokesperson declined to comment, but Peterson was adamant the deal would be approved.
[01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:24.934]  It's a solid deal, and that's all I'll say.
[01:02:24.934 --> 01:02:28.297]  But a representative of the Corrections Advocacy Group
[01:02:28.877 --> 01:02:29.377]  I don't think so.
[01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:53.442]  Hilton 55 uses the title Captain when introducing himself and on his business cards, but he acknowledged it is not a military rank.
[01:02:53.442 --> 01:03:03.234]  Remember this is the same guy that told you he was a loan officer, a cook, a restaurant owner, a car salesman, all being reported by the mainstream media right now.
[01:03:04.386 --> 01:03:05.948]  He said he is a naturalized U.S.
[01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.432]  citizen and a native of Montenegro.
[01:03:08.432 --> 01:03:15.681]  Aliases for Hilton that appear in court documents include the, uh, the Dokovich, the Michael Hamilton, Michael Dokovich.
[01:03:15.681 --> 01:03:17.924]  He uses, uh, Dokovich quite a bit.
[01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:21.529]  One attorney who dealt with Hilton in a fraud lawsuit referred to him as a chameleon!
[01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.292]  And has a reputation for winning people over with his charm.
[01:03:25.292 --> 01:03:28.514]  His criminal record goes back at least to 1988.
[01:03:28.514 --> 01:03:29.935]  We reported 1993.
[01:03:29.935 --> 01:03:39.040]  The Associated Press is digging up reports of 1988 when Hilton was arrested in Santa Ana, California for writing bad checks.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:49.586]  Beginning in 93, Hilton spent six years in prison in California on a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges including illegal diversion of construction funds.
[01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:55.180]  Billings Gazette said two years, Associated Press is saying six years.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:08.148]  The charges include stealing $20,000 in real estate swindle in which Hilton convinced an associate to give him a deed to property in Long Beach, California, ostensibly as collateral on a loan.
[01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:14.131]  Hilton turned around and sold the property to another party, but was caught when the buyer contacted the original owner.
[01:04:16.235 --> 01:04:20.800]  After his release, he got entangled in at least three civil lawsuits alleging fraud and misrepresentation.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:38.317]  Those included luring investors to sink money into gold and silver collectible coins, posing as a fine arts dealer in Utah in order to convince a couple to give him a $100,000 silver statue, and in the case of involving co-defendant Carella, seeking investors for assisted living complex in Southern California that was never built.
[01:04:38.877 --> 01:04:42.739]  See, he'll promise you the world and then give you a nightmare, folks.
[01:04:42.739 --> 01:04:43.779]  And that's what this is.
[01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.480]  This is a nightmarish takeover.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.680]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.981]  Alex on the ground in Montana right now.
[01:04:48.981 --> 01:04:51.743]  I'm Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.325 --> 01:05:05.632]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.632 --> 01:05:10.158]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.158 --> 01:05:12.441]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.063]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.063 --> 01:05:15.105]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.325 --> 01:05:23.749]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:00.287 --> 01:06:03.669]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:07.292]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.292 --> 01:06:11.875]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:17.459]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.759 --> 01:06:22.522]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.522 --> 01:06:26.144]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.144 --> 01:06:30.967]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.967 --> 01:06:37.531]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.531 --> 01:06:39.472]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.

[01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:09.029]  I don't know.

[01:08:09.156 --> 01:08:10.137]  We are back, folks.
[01:08:10.137 --> 01:08:11.498]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:11.498 --> 01:08:16.582]  Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana at the FEMA camp.
[01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.183]  Boston Herald picking up on this.
[01:08:18.183 --> 01:08:19.985]  Associated Press picking up on this.
[01:08:21.874 --> 01:08:23.917]  We also have USA Today in front of us.
[01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:26.761]  We're going to read this USA Today article.
[01:08:26.761 --> 01:08:37.397]  This is on the coattails, of course, of InfoWars reporting and Prison Planet reporting and the Billings Gazette coming out and saying that this Hilton character has numerous aliases, multiple felony convictions.
[01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:42.204]  And connections to foreign military operations.
[01:08:42.204 --> 01:08:46.566]  That's the reality that we live under today in the new America.
[01:08:46.566 --> 01:08:47.827]  With a K, folks.
[01:08:47.827 --> 01:08:50.368]  With a K. Alright, I promised I'd take some of your calls.
[01:08:50.368 --> 01:08:52.689]  Let's go to Omari in the Virgin Islands.
[01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:54.690]  Omari, you're on the line.
[01:08:54.690 --> 01:08:56.591]  Alright, let's go to Chase in Virginia.
[01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:59.973]  Chase, you're on the line.
[01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:01.834]  Alright, let's go to Phillip in Michigan.
[01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:03.995]  Phillip, you're on the line.
[01:09:03.995 --> 01:09:05.276]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:05.456]  Yes.
[01:09:06.601 --> 01:09:08.562]  Yeah, this is unbelievable.
[01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:12.743]  I called these people this morning at their county government building.
[01:09:12.743 --> 01:09:18.525]  I called their little lawyer, what's her name, the city attorney, Robert Snively.
[01:09:18.525 --> 01:09:20.186]  I got through to some woman.
[01:09:20.186 --> 01:09:22.306]  They totally deny all this stuff.
[01:09:22.306 --> 01:09:23.527]  What are they saying?
[01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:24.607]  What specifically?
[01:09:24.607 --> 01:09:25.847]  Did you talk to Becky Shays?
[01:09:25.847 --> 01:09:31.009]  She seems to be the spokesperson that they're going to.
[01:09:31.009 --> 01:09:33.110]  Becky Shays for the Blackwater, right?
[01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:34.370]  Isn't she one of the Blackwater?
[01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.091]  Well, I'm not sure if she's with... Okay, go ahead.
[01:09:37.068 --> 01:09:40.670]  I talked to the Hardin, um, their community.
[01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:41.151]  Okay.
[01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:44.953]  And I got through to the city attorney, um, or the secretary.
[01:09:44.953 --> 01:09:46.414]  They totally deny it.
[01:09:46.414 --> 01:09:51.997]  She's saying that it doesn't exist and there's no foreign troops or no Blackwater there.
[01:09:51.997 --> 01:09:53.639]  No police.
[01:09:53.639 --> 01:09:55.480]  Uh, I called the mayor's number.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.461]  I get through to one of his secretaries.
[01:09:57.461 --> 01:10:00.403]  She's saying, you know, it's all a miscommunication.
[01:10:00.403 --> 01:10:03.685]  I tell her flat out, you know, Blackwater is responsible for killing children.
[01:10:04.107 --> 01:10:05.609]  You know, they're all over the world doing it.
[01:10:05.609 --> 01:10:07.212]  Why are you putting them there?
[01:10:07.212 --> 01:10:09.155]  Why aren't you telling people about this?
[01:10:09.155 --> 01:10:11.178]  You know, are you being responsible for murder?
[01:10:11.178 --> 01:10:12.260]  What's wrong with you?
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:12.921]  And they're liars!
[01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:22.765]  Well they're absolutely liars and the USA Today is showing a picture of the camp which is highly fortified.
[01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:29.551]  You're looking at probably 10 to 15 foot fences with barbed wire at the top.
[01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:33.854]  Let's read the headline out of USA Today and I thank you for the call and the effort, Philip.
[01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:39.740]  What is the American Police Force and what is it doing in Montana?
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:52.612]  A Secret of California outfit known as APF is taking over a two-year-old never-used prison in Hardin, Montana that was briefly considered as a possible spot for Guantanamo prisoners.
[01:10:52.612 --> 01:10:54.774]  Folks, they're not shutting down Gitmo.
[01:10:54.774 --> 01:10:56.136]  Those are the headlines this week.
[01:10:56.136 --> 01:10:57.137]  It's just too difficult.
[01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:06.950]  They're saying that they may relocate some of them here and that'll give them excuse for extensive military and paramilitary and merc groups to train there.
[01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:08.331]  Again, they have to have a reason.
[01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:10.733]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:15.238]  Oh, we really want to shut down Guantanamo Bay, but we have to put these prisoners somewhere.
[01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:19.242]  Why not bring them to a privatized military facility run by FEMA?
[01:11:21.072 --> 01:11:22.593]  The story has many twists and turns.
[01:11:22.593 --> 01:11:26.417]  We recommend you read the Billings Gazette article for a primer on the story.
[01:11:26.417 --> 01:11:32.603]  KULR-TV and Billings Montana, the Missourian and Talking Points Memo are also on the case.
[01:11:32.603 --> 01:11:38.548]  So this is linking to all the articles that we've been discussing here in the first hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:11:38.548 --> 01:11:41.691]  APF's website, which has been periodically unavailable,
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.481]  Click here for a recent cache of their site.
[01:11:44.481 --> 01:12:01.333]  Again, they're doing their best to try to disassociate themselves from Blackwater, but if you go to PrisonPlanet.com right now, the top story, exposed, AFP is a Blackwater front group, AP, or I'm sorry, APF scrambles to delete webpage admitting it runs Blackwater, controlled U.S.
[01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:06.037]  training center, proving that the two organizations are one and the same.
[01:12:07.628 --> 01:12:10.049]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:12:10.049 --> 01:12:24.637]  The site says it leverages the talent and expertise of their extensive global network to provide local, regional, and national security solutions to the United States government and other clients who are in need of customized private investigative services.
[01:12:24.637 --> 01:12:25.618]  Now where have we heard that?
[01:12:26.582 --> 01:12:29.745]  Local, regional and national security solutions.
[01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:43.216]  Well, we heard it when they were running up to NLE09, the big summer takeover drill that involved foreign countries, privatized groups and got you ready for what's occurring right now in Hardin, Montana.
[01:12:43.216 --> 01:12:44.637]  Here's the website pitch.
[01:12:44.637 --> 01:12:49.221]  Whether you were suspicious about a cheating spouse or concerned about a personal threat, APF's team
[01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.159]  We're good to go.
[01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:26.729]  Mercedes SUVs belonging to APF began showing up recently in a town with magnetic decals that say City of Hardin Police Department, but later removed them because they're not police, they're private security forces.
[01:13:26.729 --> 01:13:37.736]  Albert Peterson, Vice President of Hardin's tax-supported economic development arm that built the prison two years ago, says people will be shocked when they learn the high quality of the person who will be running the operation.
[01:13:37.736 --> 01:13:41.959]  The Gazette reports, I did my background checks, I did my homework, and they're legit.
[01:13:43.319 --> 01:13:44.720]  But they won't reveal the name.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:53.207]  Peterson's APF hopes to begin filling the prisoner with inmates early next year, but neither he nor APF will say where the prisoners are coming from.
[01:13:53.207 --> 01:14:05.416]  The Gazette quotes local law officials as saying, they have reason to believe that APF is a spin-off of a much larger security company that has contracts around the world, aka Blackwater.
[01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:08.498]  The story, again, up at Prison Planet, over at InfoWars.
[01:14:08.498 --> 01:14:10.300]  We're the first to bring you the truth.
[01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:18.821]  Montana Rep Bob Ebinger has joined other lawmakers in seeking questions from hardened officials about the unusual deal.
[01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:27.209]  Always when things are secretive, you end up getting everybody on both the right and the left making suppositions about what's going on.
[01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:34.737]  But KULR says APF's founder Michael Hilton has an extensive criminal record and has spent six years in a California prison.
[01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:43.824]  The miscellanean says court records show he also has alias mid... These are the same aliases we've been discussing all morning.
[01:14:43.824 --> 01:14:51.207]  And they are making note, for what it's worth, the APF logo is almost identical to the symbol of the state flag of Serbia.
[01:14:51.207 --> 01:14:54.349]  Just incredible revelations brought to you first
[01:14:55.089 --> 01:15:03.291]  By Infowars.com and Alex Jones and now USA Today, the Associated Press, the Boston Herald, all picking up on this information.
[01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:05.072]  Alright, let's go back to the phone line.
[01:15:05.072 --> 01:15:06.092]  Shelly in Texas.
[01:15:06.092 --> 01:15:08.813]  Shelly, you're on the line.
[01:15:08.813 --> 01:15:10.673]  Yes, Shelly.
[01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.213]  We drop her?
[01:15:12.213 --> 01:15:13.174]  Paul in Canada.
[01:15:13.174 --> 01:15:16.615]  Paul, you're on the line.
[01:15:16.615 --> 01:15:17.455]  Hi, Jason.
[01:15:17.455 --> 01:15:17.735]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:19.572 --> 01:15:23.796]  Uh, okay, so I made a couple phone calls myself yesterday.
[01:15:23.796 --> 01:15:28.061]  I called Blackwater directly, or not Blackwater, sorry, American Police Force.
[01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:34.747]  I called the number on their website and I asked them, do you guys offer services in Canada?
[01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:36.449]  And he tells me, no we do not.
[01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:44.458]  Uh, we are starting out in Montana, and we will be spreading out, uh, expanding throughout the state.
[01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:45.218]  That's huge!
[01:15:45.218 --> 01:15:46.378]  That is so huge!
[01:15:46.378 --> 01:15:55.021]  So they admitted on the phone that the Blackwater operations are indeed starting in Montana, so this is an extension of Blackwater, confirmed.
[01:15:55.021 --> 01:15:56.181]  But why would he be?
[01:15:56.181 --> 01:15:57.821]  I mean, why is he so free about this?
[01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:00.522]  Like, I encourage other people to call up and ask the same thing.
[01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:03.483]  I wanted to know if they're in Canada, because obviously, I mean, that's where I'm from.
[01:16:04.614 --> 01:16:08.256]  So, um, I sort of left it at that and I said, okay, thank you.
[01:16:08.256 --> 01:16:10.257]  And he's like, uh huh.
[01:16:10.257 --> 01:16:11.758]  I'm probably going to get gang stopped now.
[01:16:11.758 --> 01:16:12.878]  Who knows?
[01:16:12.878 --> 01:16:20.662]  Um, so, uh, I made another call to the, uh, Montana state militia and, uh,
[01:16:21.631 --> 01:16:30.233]  I asked him if he had any concerns and he basically, to paraphrase him, he's telling me, oh, it's no big deal, you know, everyone's making a lot of hype about it.
[01:16:30.233 --> 01:16:35.475]  He's like, we went there, they had three black Mercedes Benz, they're staying at a bed and breakfast.
[01:16:35.475 --> 01:16:37.535]  He's like, people are making all this hype.
[01:16:37.535 --> 01:16:40.616]  And he also said that California prisoners are going to be transferred there.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.080]  This is unbelievable.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.221]  This is not hype, folks.
[01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:46.882]  This is how they get you prepared.
[01:16:46.882 --> 01:16:49.262]  It's called incrementalism.
[01:16:49.262 --> 01:16:55.564]  They slowly but surely drag you by the leash of tyranny and let you know what's coming.
[01:16:55.564 --> 01:16:56.185]  Okay?
[01:16:56.185 --> 01:16:57.245]  They had the prison.
[01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:59.086]  It was built in 2007.
[01:16:59.086 --> 01:17:02.547]  They knew that they didn't have a real prison populace out in Montana.
[01:17:02.547 --> 01:17:05.868]  They knew they would be shipping in criminals from across the world.
[01:17:06.508 --> 01:17:08.909]  They knew it was going to be privatized.
[01:17:08.909 --> 01:17:30.961]  They didn't know that the media was going to be so Johnny-on-the-spot of exposing this Hilton character as a multiple felon with multiple aliases, as a con man, as a foreigner who's running a merc operation in the United States of America on the coattails of the biggest military presence in the United States ever in Pittsburgh.
[01:17:31.201 --> 01:17:37.683]  Where there were checkpoints and Humvees and National Guard personnel everywhere you look in the downtown area.
[01:17:37.683 --> 01:17:44.925]  After the riot cops went berserk, firing rubber bullets and tear gas on innocent civilians.
[01:17:44.925 --> 01:17:48.606]  I mean, you look at that video from Friday that's posted over at Infowars.com.
[01:17:48.606 --> 01:17:56.328]  Again, there's less than 200, maybe tops 300 people, most of them not even protesters, being attacked by riot police.
[01:17:56.328 --> 01:17:59.769]  And I read the comments on these things and they say there's no military there.
[01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:04.792]  It doesn't matter if I zoom in on two men in full military uniform.
[01:18:04.792 --> 01:18:09.755]  It doesn't matter if it's admitted that 2,500 National Guard were deployed there.
[01:18:09.755 --> 01:18:11.016]  It just doesn't exist.
[01:18:11.016 --> 01:18:13.857]  People want to wallow in their own willful ignorance.
[01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:14.898]  It's disgusting.
[01:18:14.898 --> 01:18:17.900]  We're going to continue to take your calls, then we're going to have more word
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:27.624]  From the streets of Hardin, Montana, we're going to have Hollingsworth on, this former military personnel who brought us the story and was very eloquent yesterday on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:27.624 --> 01:18:32.066]  If you missed that program yesterday, I'm encouraging you to get the podcast right now.
[01:18:32.066 --> 01:18:33.226]  Vital information.
[01:18:33.226 --> 01:18:35.107]  We're building on that vital information.
[01:18:35.107 --> 01:18:40.849]  Again, Alex Jones on the ground right now in Hardin, Montana at the FEMA Center.
[01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.850]  Let's take one more call before the break.
[01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:43.790]  Nathan in Portland.
[01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:46.191]  Nathan, you're on the line.
[01:18:46.191 --> 01:18:46.772]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:46.772 --> 01:18:47.032]  You there?
[01:18:48.786 --> 01:18:51.367]  How's it going?
[01:18:51.367 --> 01:18:53.088]  I'm kind of nervous.
[01:18:53.088 --> 01:18:55.709]  This is my first call.
[01:18:55.709 --> 01:19:09.655]  I've been listening to you guys for a while and it's about the swine flu and I just heard an online ad thing for Len Horowitz on the show.
[01:19:09.655 --> 01:19:13.377]  Something about oxysilver.
[01:19:14.355 --> 01:19:20.097]  All I can say about these silver solutions is that they do help your immune system.
[01:19:20.097 --> 01:19:21.877]  I'm not out here preaching a cure-all.
[01:19:21.877 --> 01:19:29.659]  I'm not sure if that's a GCN spot or that's an InfoWars spot, but we can't make any medical claims on this program.
[01:19:29.659 --> 01:19:35.341]  Obviously, you want to protect yourself and your immune system during this phony pandemic.
[01:19:35.341 --> 01:19:38.422]  But a lot of people will get sick if they continue to take this shot.
[01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:43.083]  Remember, the study says two and a half times more likely to get the swine flu
[01:19:43.743 --> 01:19:45.207]  If you take the vaccination.
[01:19:45.207 --> 01:19:47.031]  We'll be back with more breaking news after this.
[01:19:47.031 --> 01:19:48.093]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:48.093 --> 01:19:49.436]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:19:49.436 --> 01:19:51.420]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:20:00.948 --> 01:20:07.653]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.653 --> 01:20:09.334]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.334 --> 01:20:13.917]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:21.582]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.582 --> 01:20:24.064]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.224 --> 01:20:24.604]  I think so.
[01:20:41.926 --> 01:20:42.767]  I think so.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.561]  Gold.
[01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:03.083]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:09.372]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.372 --> 01:21:13.557]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.557 --> 01:21:15.500]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.742]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:18.203 --> 01:21:18.603]  We're good to go.
[01:21:42.517 --> 01:21:45.399]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.918 --> 01:22:12.802]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:19.306]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.306 --> 01:22:21.287]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.287 --> 01:22:23.728]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:23.728 --> 01:22:34.615]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.582]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.582 --> 01:22:40.444]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.444 --> 01:22:47.351]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.351 --> 01:22:55.620]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.201]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.201 --> 01:22:58.403]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.396 --> 01:23:07.680]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:11.101]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?
[01:23:11.101 --> 01:23:12.242]  Well, now you can.
[01:23:12.242 --> 01:23:14.423]  Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:22.847]  The Magic Yellow Flyer marketing system is the most effective and inexpensive way to build a referral-only service business in a short period of time.
[01:23:22.847 --> 01:23:25.809]  Get new customers and build a solid customer base.
[01:23:26.109 --> 01:23:29.932]  Throw away all of the other ineffective and expensive advertising methods.
[01:23:29.932 --> 01:23:31.673]  You need the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:36.656]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.

[01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:22.301]  Folks, when Obama came out and said, yes, we need a civilian security force that's just as big, just as well-funded, just as supported as the U.S.
[01:24:22.301 --> 01:24:23.863]  military, you should have been listening.
[01:24:25.049 --> 01:24:26.370]  And it isn't just Obama.
[01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:28.751]  It's the special interests behind him.
[01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:32.654]  And now we're seeing that come to fruition in Hardin, Montana.
[01:24:32.654 --> 01:24:38.518]  The caller just said he called Blackwater straight up and they said, no, we haven't launched anything in Canada yet.
[01:24:38.518 --> 01:24:42.040]  We're starting in Montana, in the United States.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.241]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:49.525]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in Alex to report in less than 60 minutes on the ground.
[01:24:49.525 --> 01:24:54.268]  It's just unbelievable that this is happening in our country today.
[01:24:55.441 --> 01:24:57.483]  And most of the mainstream media doesn't want to touch it.
[01:24:57.483 --> 01:25:07.051]  They don't want to talk about it because of you, the listeners out there that are posting on forums, that are emailing the mainstream media, that are calling Blackwater.
[01:25:07.051 --> 01:25:09.594]  USA Today has picked up on the story.
[01:25:09.594 --> 01:25:11.976]  Boston Herald has picked up on the story.
[01:25:13.376 --> 01:25:30.623]  And in front of me to illustrate the point that this isn't just the Obama administration's plan, this is the military-industrial complex's plan, this is the plan of the technopoly out there to further the control grid that we all are under at this point.
[01:25:30.623 --> 01:25:33.784]  I want to read just part of this document from the Rand Corporation.
[01:25:34.821 --> 01:25:36.382]  This is a research brief.
[01:25:36.382 --> 01:25:42.046]  Does the United States need a new police force for stability operations?
[01:25:42.046 --> 01:25:48.149]  You see, they don't like the police force out there that's here to serve and protect you.
[01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:51.171]  No, they want officials.
[01:25:51.171 --> 01:25:53.433]  They want officials.
[01:25:53.433 --> 01:25:57.155]  You see, they don't want a police force that's there to help citizens.
[01:25:57.155 --> 01:26:03.219]  No, they want a police force that's out there to persecute.
[01:26:05.131 --> 01:26:07.052]  To go after us.
[01:26:07.052 --> 01:26:09.393]  To not have a problem pulling the trigger.
[01:26:09.393 --> 01:26:11.475]  Putting us in a camp.
[01:26:11.475 --> 01:26:15.777]  Stability operations have become a prominent feature of the international landscape.
[01:26:15.777 --> 01:26:17.638]  Recent examples include U.S.
[01:26:17.638 --> 01:26:18.159]  and U.N.
[01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:22.601]  operations in Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
[01:26:22.601 --> 01:26:27.184]  And now they're trying to turn us into a second or third world nation.
[01:26:27.184 --> 01:26:29.265]  Did you hear what I just read?
[01:26:29.265 --> 01:26:29.745]  U.S.
[01:26:29.745 --> 01:26:32.287]  and U.N., which have been amalgamated into one,
[01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:46.616]  As the United States heads up the UN Security Council this month, and Barack Obama became the first sitting president to ever accept the very big conflict of interest position as the head of that council.
[01:26:46.616 --> 01:26:48.337]  You don't think global government's here?
[01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:51.659]  They're announcing it at the G20!
[01:26:51.659 --> 01:26:53.180]  The death of the dollar is here!
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.122]  It's on the cover of the Washington Post!
[01:26:56.122 --> 01:26:59.805]  The SDR unit is readily being traded around the world!
[01:27:01.038 --> 01:27:05.199]  What is it going to take to wake us up?
[01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:06.659]  Is this the final straw?
[01:27:06.659 --> 01:27:08.119]  Are you awake?
[01:27:08.119 --> 01:27:09.660]  Are you calling your neighbor right now?
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.860]  Are you telling them to tune in?
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:13.681]  That's the question.
[01:27:13.681 --> 01:27:15.841]  Are you being vigilant?
[01:27:15.841 --> 01:27:18.422]  Because you can be vigilant if you want to be.
[01:27:18.422 --> 01:27:22.002]  You can become a human being again.
[01:27:22.002 --> 01:27:24.303]  You can be in support of humanity
[01:27:25.447 --> 01:27:41.373]  Instead of enslavement, you only empower these people when you become fearful of what they're doing, when you refuse to stand up for your rights, when you refuse to say, it's not okay that Blackwater is taking over a FEMA camp!
[01:27:41.373 --> 01:27:42.493]  And that's what this is!
[01:27:42.493 --> 01:27:48.095]  They built this prison in 2007, while the Bush administration was still in office, knowing
[01:27:49.158 --> 01:27:50.859]  That these plans would further themselves.
[01:27:50.859 --> 01:27:53.682]  That they would take one step here, and another step there.
[01:27:53.682 --> 01:27:56.264]  And all of a sudden, you're in total tyranny.
[01:27:56.264 --> 01:28:03.590]  As the economy collapses, the population is more apt to succumb to these tyrants!
[01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:04.911]  Alright, let's continue with your callers.
[01:28:04.911 --> 01:28:09.394]  We got a loaded phone line, and then we have Hollinger coming up in the next segment.
[01:28:09.394 --> 01:28:10.975]  Let's go to Curtis in Missouri.
[01:28:10.975 --> 01:28:13.117]  Curtis, you're on the line.
[01:28:13.117 --> 01:28:15.319]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:15.319 --> 01:28:15.959]  Curtis, you're with us.
[01:28:18.069 --> 01:28:21.433]  By the artists, Drake and Kanye West.
[01:28:21.433 --> 01:28:30.264]  And in one of the verses, Kanye West says, Now, is this some kind of coincidence or does he know something?
[01:28:31.624 --> 01:28:33.124]  You know, I'm really not following Curtis.
[01:28:33.124 --> 01:28:33.825]  I'm going to jump.
[01:28:33.825 --> 01:28:39.686]  I mean, I'm not a big fan of Kanye West in the first place, and I'm not sure that he's too politically relevant at this point.
[01:28:39.686 --> 01:28:47.169]  He seems like a drunken moron that's getting a bunch of press for, you know, jumping Taylor Swift at the Music Video Awards.
[01:28:47.169 --> 01:28:48.189]  I mean, look at his haircut.
[01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.789]  Can you take that guy seriously?
[01:28:49.789 --> 01:28:51.410]  I'm going to go with no, you can't.
[01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.670]  Leaf in Montana.
[01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:53.530]  Leaf, you're on the line.
[01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:56.011]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:28:56.011 --> 01:28:57.052]  Good.
[01:28:57.052 --> 01:28:58.612]  I just wanted to bring up some
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.681]  Clarity on some issues.
[01:29:00.681 --> 01:29:13.270]  We have a member of the Crow tribe from Crow Agency there that has been appointed the Deputy Assistant to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
[01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:16.633]  Obama has had an interest in Native issues.
[01:29:16.633 --> 01:29:24.899]  Tribal land is sovereign ground and it makes it very attractive for people like this Blackwater to build their facilities there because they're not bound by laws.
[01:29:24.899 --> 01:29:27.181]  Like Montana can't say, no you can't build this.
[01:29:27.722 --> 01:29:40.085]  Well that's a great point and again we saw the integration of not only regional but tribal governments in NLE09 prepping the public and again now it's coming into fruition in Hardin, Montana.
[01:29:40.085 --> 01:29:41.065]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:41.065 --> 01:29:42.145]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:42.145 --> 01:29:43.506]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[01:29:43.506 --> 01:29:51.127]  More from Alex and others on the ground in Montana after this.
[01:29:51.127 --> 01:29:52.508]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.508 --> 01:29:54.028]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.052 --> 01:30:01.075]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.075 --> 01:30:04.096]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.096 --> 01:30:09.418]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.418 --> 01:30:11.479]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.479 --> 01:30:16.461]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.461 --> 01:30:17.382]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.642 --> 01:30:18.763]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.763 --> 01:30:20.664]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.664 --> 01:30:21.725]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.725 --> 01:30:23.926]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.926 --> 01:30:25.267]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.267 --> 01:30:26.808]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.808 --> 01:30:32.072]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.072 --> 01:30:35.654]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.654 --> 01:30:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.457 --> 01:30:40.698]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.698 --> 01:30:41.598]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.598 --> 01:30:42.699]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.699 --> 01:30:43.639]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.639 --> 01:30:44.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:47.782]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.782 --> 01:30:49.543]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.543 --> 01:30:50.463]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:05.529]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.529 --> 01:31:10.055]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.055 --> 01:31:12.338]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.338 --> 01:31:13.960]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.002]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.222 --> 01:31:23.644]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:31.086]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.086 --> 01:31:36.768]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.128 --> 01:31:43.153]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.153 --> 01:31:47.296]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.296 --> 01:31:54.762]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:31:54.762 --> 01:31:58.065]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:00.799 --> 01:32:05.964]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:32:05.964 --> 01:32:09.467]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:32:09.467 --> 01:32:15.193]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:32:15.193 --> 01:32:17.735]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:32:17.735 --> 01:32:22.299]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:32:22.299 --> 01:32:25.022]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:32:25.442 --> 01:32:31.184]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:32:31.184 --> 01:32:33.425]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:33.425 --> 01:32:41.988]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:32:41.988 --> 01:32:42.988]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:32:43.368 --> 01:32:47.951]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:32:47.951 --> 01:32:53.055]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:32:53.055 --> 01:32:54.816]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:32:54.816 --> 01:32:57.018]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:57.018 --> 01:32:58.759]  Be well and stay well.
[01:32:58.759 --> 01:32:59.480]  Best MZ!
[01:33:13.152 --> 01:33:21.207]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103
[01:33:23.254 --> 01:33:41.909]  We were joined briefly on the Alex Jones Show yesterday by Michael Hollingsworth, who's on the ground in Montana, who has spoken with this Becky Shea character, formerly of the Billings Gazette, now working with these APF gentlemen, and I use that term rather lightly.
[01:33:41.909 --> 01:33:42.789]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:42.789 --> 01:33:43.930]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:49.455]  We're going to have a report live from Alex, who is also in Hardin, Montana right now, covering this.
[01:33:49.995 --> 01:33:59.040]  With boots on the ground, Mr. Hollingsworth, just briefly tell people about your military service in both the Navy and Special Operations.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.623]  For my own personal security reasons, I'm going to decline to go into too much detail.
[01:34:04.623 --> 01:34:09.746]  That's just something that I don't give out publicly.
[01:34:09.746 --> 01:34:13.868]  For a basic reference, I started out in Amphibious Operations Military Law Enforcement with the U.S.
[01:34:13.868 --> 01:34:15.329]  Navy and was connected to
[01:34:21.993 --> 01:34:23.974]  Absolutely, we completely understand.
[01:34:23.974 --> 01:34:26.396]  So how did you come across this information?
[01:34:26.396 --> 01:34:28.097]  I mean, was there a buzz around town?
[01:34:28.097 --> 01:34:30.078]  Did you just start seeing the SUVs?
[01:34:30.078 --> 01:34:32.940]  Did you see these people acting as police officers?
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.962]  How do you become aware of this?
[01:34:35.796 --> 01:34:45.661]  Well, essentially what it boils down to is, as I mentioned yesterday on the show with Alex, I operate a patriotically based website that has experienced an overnight surge in membership.
[01:34:45.661 --> 01:34:48.623]  And, you know, American patriotism is no stranger to my family.
[01:34:48.623 --> 01:34:52.505]  This is something that we've done for our entire existence.
[01:34:53.095 --> 01:35:13.761]  We've always been American patriots and we watch these things very carefully because with the current presidential administration usurping the Constitution at every turn, creating czars to bypass our system of checks and balances, completely ignoring the will and the voice of the American people, you know, it's just so painfully obvious to us that at every turn that the voice of the American people is no longer being heard.
[01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:19.323]  This is evidenced by the tea parties, by the town hall meetings and everyone's criticism that the
[01:35:24.071 --> 01:35:26.732]  In the middle of these events, it's the only way we can be heard.
[01:35:26.732 --> 01:35:33.613]  You know, we had a senator from South Carolina, in the middle of a presidential address, said, you're a liar to the president.
[01:35:33.613 --> 01:35:36.074]  Right out on global television, you know?
[01:35:36.074 --> 01:35:42.635]  And with that being said, you know, it's coming to the point now where their game is being detected by far too many people.
[01:35:42.635 --> 01:35:46.496]  American patriots are waking up at a phenomenal pace.
[01:35:47.841 --> 01:35:52.042]  You know, they're coming to grips with the fact that what's going on is not kosher.
[01:35:52.042 --> 01:35:55.103]  It's not what has been represented to us.
[01:35:55.103 --> 01:35:57.803]  You know, when our president during his campaign said, I'm going to bring you change.
[01:35:57.803 --> 01:35:59.604]  Well, yeah, he brought us change.
[01:35:59.604 --> 01:36:07.685]  He also said that we needed an American, a national police force that was equally as strong and equally as well equipped and trained as our current military.
[01:36:07.685 --> 01:36:11.166]  Well, we're seeing it in the form of this American police force thing.
[01:36:11.166 --> 01:36:15.167]  And then now overnight, now that this has gotten so much notoriety and so much
[01:36:16.307 --> 01:36:30.777]  In media coverage, they're discovering that this Michael Hilton guy, who is the headpiece of this American police force, is actually 1.1 million dollars in debt, and there's a barrage of California lawyers now that are hunting him down.
[01:36:31.587 --> 01:36:33.628]  He has three aliases.
[01:36:33.628 --> 01:36:36.430]  Dokovich is the last name for three of them.
[01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:40.333]  They're finding out that he's been a 14-time convicted felon in the state of California.
[01:36:40.333 --> 01:36:49.179]  And then, you know, all these guys like Peterson, Al Peterson with the Two Rivers Authority, and he tells the media, oh, we've done our background checks, and we know who the guy is, and we feel comfortable about him.
[01:36:49.179 --> 01:36:51.821]  Becky Shea said to the world that, you know, that's his private business.
[01:36:51.821 --> 01:36:53.342]  Well, no, it's really not.
[01:36:53.342 --> 01:36:54.823]  It's really not his private business.
[01:36:54.823 --> 01:37:01.047]  When you're handling $27 million worth of a bond referendum of taxpayer money that these people
[01:37:01.067 --> 01:37:01.427]  I don't
[01:37:20.146 --> 01:37:22.529]  I mean, a multitude of charges against this guy, too.
[01:37:22.529 --> 01:37:26.473]  Let's make it clear, these aren't, like, Namby Pamby slap on the wrist type charges.
[01:37:26.473 --> 01:37:29.136]  You just discussed $1.1 million.
[01:37:29.136 --> 01:37:31.818]  Well, that was weighed against him in a civil case.
[01:37:31.818 --> 01:37:37.965]  They're saying that this guy has posed as a car salesman, as a restaurant owner, as a arts dealer.
[01:37:37.965 --> 01:37:40.728]  I mean, every scam in the book, he has...
[01:37:41.869 --> 01:37:42.989]  Yeah, Global Collectibles.
[01:37:42.989 --> 01:37:55.232]  He served, apparently, not two years in prison, but six years in prison, according to the Associated Press, in this latest Boston Herald article that has really just come into development in the last hour or so.
[01:37:55.232 --> 01:38:04.594]  USA Today is now picking up on the story, but he's got over a dozen aliases, 14 felonies, including 10 counts of grand theft.
[01:38:04.594 --> 01:38:10.775]  This isn't you and I saying it, this is the actual Billings Gazette that used to employ this Becky Shea character.
[01:38:11.476 --> 01:38:11.856]  Correct.
[01:38:11.856 --> 01:38:29.991]  And you know, here's the scary thing, and I'm going to step out on a limb at the risk of making a semi-accusatory statement, and I'm going to suggest that anybody with an IQ equivalent to a bowl of fruit salad can see that the conspiracy and the corruption involved in this is a heck of a lot higher than only the hardened City Council and Two Rivers Authority.
[01:38:29.991 --> 01:38:31.853]  Several people must have been paid off.
[01:38:32.458 --> 01:38:38.881]  You know, you cannot build a $27 million facility without knowing that it's not going to match code.
[01:38:38.881 --> 01:38:43.763]  You know, Montana state law was very clear about the square footage requirements to be able to incarcerate prisoners.
[01:38:43.763 --> 01:38:48.765]  So my question becomes this, and this is the question that I pose to every listener out there right now.
[01:38:48.765 --> 01:38:50.086]  It's very simple.
[01:38:50.086 --> 01:38:52.387]  How far back does this plan go?
[01:38:52.387 --> 01:38:55.108]  And how many people are truly involved in it?
[01:38:55.108 --> 01:38:56.568]  You know, where is the money?
[01:38:56.568 --> 01:38:57.869]  That's what we need to do now.
[01:38:57.869 --> 01:38:59.910]  These guys have sacrificed their mouthpiece.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:07.925]  They threw Becky Shea and they threw Michael Hilton out to the wolves because they knew those two would be torn to pieces just like they have over the last 48 hours.
[01:39:07.925 --> 01:39:08.686]  They got shredded.
[01:39:09.636 --> 01:39:11.296]  That's called probing defenses.
[01:39:11.296 --> 01:39:12.737]  That's called probing defenses.
[01:39:12.737 --> 01:39:17.338]  They wanted to find out just how many people were paying attention and exactly what the response would be.
[01:39:17.338 --> 01:39:20.278]  Now what we need to do, and I've got breaking news that's coming out on this.
[01:39:20.278 --> 01:39:23.059]  I'm going to tell you guys something.
[01:39:23.059 --> 01:39:24.880]  Essentially personal risk here.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.541]  I had a committee last night working in conjunction with a Montana state senator who at this point in time is going to remain unnamed.
[01:39:31.241 --> 01:39:45.421]  We actually cracked American Police Force's website and bypassed some of their security protocols and found out that they have a direct connection to, I want to say it's called DP, let me find the, I gotta get into my emails here, I've been sending these things all night.
[01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:47.644]  Uh, DPNSA, I think it is, is the link.
[01:39:48.948 --> 01:39:54.330]  I believe it is dpnsa.com slash aboutus dot htm.
[01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:54.970]  I have it in front of me.
[01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:55.330]  That's him.
[01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:55.630]  Okay.
[01:39:55.630 --> 01:39:56.130]  That's the one.
[01:39:56.130 --> 01:40:01.712]  Now most people's computers are not going to be able to get past their moderator set security protocol.
[01:40:01.712 --> 01:40:04.093]  That means that someone is deliberately blocking that site.
[01:40:04.093 --> 01:40:12.235]  One of our guys was able to bypass that and we took screen captures of their websites proving that the logos are exactly the same.
[01:40:12.235 --> 01:40:14.116]  That's what we spent all night last night.
[01:40:14.116 --> 01:40:18.297]  I had a committee of 22 people working all night long last night, desperately.
[01:40:19.304 --> 01:40:23.647]  Trying to find the connection between American police force and a private military company.
[01:40:23.647 --> 01:40:24.808]  And by God, we found it.
[01:40:24.808 --> 01:40:26.049]  We got it.
[01:40:26.049 --> 01:40:27.450]  The logo is exactly the same.
[01:40:27.450 --> 01:40:29.071]  The layout of the page is the same.
[01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:30.252]  The picture formats are the same.
[01:40:30.252 --> 01:40:34.415]  Now, things I want to draw people's attention to very clearly is that if you look at these images,
[01:40:35.055 --> 01:40:42.219]  These are foreign troops carrying foreign weapons to the terro- uh, you know, their HKG-36s, MP5 submachine guns.
[01:40:42.219 --> 01:40:45.481]  Uh, you'll see American Blackhawks, but we've sold those helicopters to everybody.
[01:40:45.481 --> 01:40:49.824]  You'll also see that Serbian Royal Family crest popping up all over the place.
[01:40:49.824 --> 01:40:53.206]  Now, it's not been too long in our history that we were dealing with Serbs and Croats.
[01:40:53.946 --> 01:40:55.226]  Uh, overseas.
[01:40:55.226 --> 01:40:59.227]  Now, that being said, this is where the investigation needs to go.
[01:40:59.227 --> 01:41:15.530]  This is where the American people need to get on their phones, contact their elected officials, and demand, through the Freedom of Information Act, and other various types of political activity groups like that, you know, there are rights, as we are, that they command these people to release their information.
[01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:17.651]  Were they functioning in Montana with a business license?
[01:41:17.651 --> 01:41:18.671]  We don't know that.
[01:41:18.671 --> 01:41:23.372]  In order to function as an investigative entity, you have to be licensed through two Montana state boards.
[01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:32.554]  So, in order to, you know, where you have all these associations with all these weapons and everything, you have to have BATFE, uh, Class 3 permits, uh, for, for dealerships.
[01:41:32.554 --> 01:41:39.516]  And even then, you know, in order to get those kinds of gun dealer licenses and everything, what, you know, this is what, guys, this is what we need to be focusing on.
[01:41:39.516 --> 01:41:41.597]  This is, this is tyranny at its finest.
[01:41:42.659 --> 01:41:44.240]  This is called unconventional warfare.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.041]  They are playing us like a cheap fiddle.
[01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:53.264]  You know, uh, Chief Executive Officer for Blackwater Security, former Navy SEAL.
[01:41:53.264 --> 01:41:54.545]  His name escapes me right at the moment.
[01:41:54.545 --> 01:41:55.625]  I've kind of wound up at the moment.
[01:41:55.625 --> 01:41:56.946]  It's been a really long night.
[01:41:56.946 --> 01:42:08.912]  Eric Prince was quoted as having said, quoted as having said to a Senate subcommittee, we can land a battalion-sized element of Special Forces qualified soldiers on the ground anywhere in the globe in less than 72 hours.
[01:42:08.912 --> 01:42:11.193]  Now, am I the only one that finds it wildly ironic
[01:42:12.079 --> 01:42:14.500]  The American Police Force says the same thing.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.721]  There's lots of similarities that are, like, verbatim.
[01:42:16.721 --> 01:42:17.541]  Now, this U.S.
[01:42:17.541 --> 01:42:22.482]  Training Center, this is something else I put out in the emails that's going out to everybody, is that U.S.
[01:42:22.482 --> 01:42:25.143]  Training Center is capitalized as a proper noun.
[01:42:25.143 --> 01:42:28.804]  That means that it is the name of a facility.
[01:42:28.804 --> 01:42:33.446]  It's a specific name, which means that, and Blackwater XE was the one that had
[01:42:34.304 --> 01:42:43.730]  We just had a caller call in from Canada who called up Blackwater asking if they had any operations going on in Canada and the man from Blackwater said no we're starting our operations in Montana.
[01:42:56.218 --> 01:43:18.079]  Another huge red flag and again up at PrisonPlanet.com right now exposed American Police Force is a Blackwater front group APF scrambles to delete webpage admitting it runs Blackwater controlled US training center proving that the two organizations are one and the same and this is up right now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com just simply amazing!
[01:43:18.763 --> 01:43:19.204]  Absolutely.
[01:43:19.204 --> 01:43:20.505]  They're on the run, buddy.
[01:43:20.505 --> 01:43:21.446]  We got them.
[01:43:21.446 --> 01:43:32.400]  The one thing that they did is they underestimated the American Patriot and they didn't think, you know, this is the information age, but they didn't think that there was many people out here, veterans, law enforcement veterans, public service veterans, concerned American citizens.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.683]  They thought we were just going to sit back and take it.
[01:43:34.683 --> 01:43:37.246]  And they're finding out just how dangerously wrong they are.
[01:43:38.263 --> 01:43:41.328]  Uh, they can run all they want and they can pull their websites all they want.
[01:43:41.328 --> 01:43:42.810]  We got screen captures.
[01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:44.032]  We got pictures.
[01:43:44.032 --> 01:43:48.859]  And for anybody listening, there are at least 100 people who have copies of those screen captures.
[01:43:49.731 --> 01:44:01.897]  Why don't you take a second and direct the listeners' energy in what they can do to help us battle this private military takeover of a United States town.
[01:44:01.897 --> 01:44:03.818]  I cannot reiterate this enough.
[01:44:03.818 --> 01:44:18.906]  They have put a convicted felon in charge, according to the Billings Gazette and other mainstream outlets, who uses over a dozen aliases and admittedly hails from a country just outside of Serbia, if not Serbia itself.
[01:44:20.113 --> 01:44:23.515]  The recommendation is very clear, very concise, and very simple.
[01:44:23.515 --> 01:44:29.039]  To all of you American patriots within the boundaries of the sound of my voice, do not initiate contact.
[01:44:29.039 --> 01:44:33.561]  Exercise as much diplomatic power as you can.
[01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:34.822]  Call your elected officials.
[01:44:34.822 --> 01:44:35.943]  Make sure that they're aware.
[01:44:35.943 --> 01:44:37.423]  Flood their phone lines.
[01:44:37.423 --> 01:44:38.844]  Flood their emails.
[01:44:38.844 --> 01:44:43.187]  Make sure that they are 100% aware that you are intimately familiar with what's going on.
[01:44:43.187 --> 01:44:48.370]  Let them know that you are an American patriot, that you believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, that you believe
[01:44:48.370 --> 01:44:49.711]  I believe in the system of checks and balances.
[01:44:49.711 --> 01:44:54.094]  I mean, this is, ladies and gentlemen that can hear me right now, this is our war.
[01:44:54.094 --> 01:45:00.518]  For all those people out there who are cocked and locked and ready for the fight, I'm here to tell you that is not the right approach at this particular moment in time.
[01:45:00.518 --> 01:45:08.903]  If we do that, that takes away every bit of credibility we have, it takes away every bit of dignity we have, and it makes them exactly what the left is trying to accuse us of being.
[01:45:08.903 --> 01:45:14.327]  If we function with intelligence, logic, and reason, you know, right now it was proven overnight that this works.
[01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:18.688]  Getting people together, using their information, get on the internet, find this stuff.
[01:45:18.688 --> 01:45:22.448]  You know, all of these web pages, Google caches and stuff like that.
[01:45:22.448 --> 01:45:25.209]  Pick out key phrases, Google the heck out of them.
[01:45:25.209 --> 01:45:28.590]  Guys, find those links, share them, get involved in groups.
[01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:33.230]  You know, contact your local friends, contact your families, make sure that they are appraised of what's going on.
[01:45:33.230 --> 01:45:37.911]  And even if they tell you, you know what, you're a right-wing extremist, say, no, mom, dad, I'm really not.
[01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:39.051]  And here's the proof.
[01:45:39.051 --> 01:45:41.332]  Don't listen to me, just look at what I'm showing you.
[01:45:42.110 --> 01:45:43.671]  You know, it's right here for your eyes to see.
[01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:46.853]  People like Alex Jones is a phenomenal resource.
[01:45:46.853 --> 01:45:51.936]  I am incredibly proud that I've been given the opportunity to get this message out to the American people.
[01:45:51.936 --> 01:45:54.198]  And I thank Alex and the rest of his staff for it.
[01:45:54.198 --> 01:45:56.219]  And, you know, you guys are doing a bang-up job.
[01:45:56.219 --> 01:45:58.541]  But just make sure that you don't give up.
[01:45:58.541 --> 01:46:02.103]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you that their strategy is very simple.
[01:46:02.103 --> 01:46:04.405]  They want to weaken you psychologically.
[01:46:04.405 --> 01:46:09.408]  They want you to become so saturated with this stuff that you become just basically desensitized to it.
[01:46:09.408 --> 01:46:10.309]  The same way they did with 9-11.
[01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:17.490]  You know, anybody can look at the Pentagon and realize that that was not a Boeing 757, but that's a whole other ball of wax, okay?
[01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:21.072]  Right now, what we need to be concentrating on is making sure that these people are aware.
[01:46:21.072 --> 01:46:22.714]  And you don't have to go out there armed.
[01:46:22.714 --> 01:46:32.121]  You can put 200, 300, 400 people on the city streets of Hardin and stand right in front of their business offices and demand that you to use a legal mean, this Freedom of Information Act.
[01:46:33.571 --> 01:46:39.212]  You can command their information to come out, but you flood Brian Schweitzer, you flood Jon Tester, you flood Max Baucus.
[01:46:39.212 --> 01:46:40.772]  All of their stuff is available online.
[01:46:40.772 --> 01:46:41.913]  All their phone numbers are online.
[01:46:41.913 --> 01:46:45.613]  If you can't find it, I'm sure Alex has put up links to my website.
[01:46:45.613 --> 01:46:49.874]  We will have, within minutes, we will have all of their emails and phone numbers up.
[01:46:49.874 --> 01:46:53.355]  But right now we have to remember to maintain the moral high ground.
[01:46:53.355 --> 01:46:56.035]  We have to maintain our dignified stance in this.
[01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:59.356]  That is the most critical and key element that I cannot focus on enough.
[01:47:00.214 --> 01:47:08.717]  You know, I would also encourage everybody out there to arm themselves with the greatest weapon in the info war and that is a camcorder.
[01:47:08.717 --> 01:47:20.140]  A small digital video camcorder can collect so much information and make people so aware of the real state of affairs going on right now in Hardin, Montana.
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.821]  It's more than a news article.
[01:47:21.821 --> 01:47:24.121]  It's more than us talking about it on the radio.
[01:47:24.121 --> 01:47:27.562]  When people can actually see the sites of U.S.
[01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:33.485]  Cities being occupied by foreign mercs.
[01:47:33.485 --> 01:47:34.185]  Let me repeat that.
[01:47:34.185 --> 01:47:35.866]  Foreign mercs.
[01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:36.766]  They better wake up.
[01:47:36.766 --> 01:47:38.247]  I mean, it is time to wake up.
[01:47:38.247 --> 01:47:44.390]  They built this prison in 2007 knowing damn well what it was being built for.
[01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:55.655]  And you know, this excuse that they might be bringing in Gitmo prisoners here is just another excuse to run further military and paramilitary and mercenary operations on site.
[01:47:56.155 --> 01:47:57.695]  And act like it is necessary.
[01:47:57.695 --> 01:48:00.056]  Yes, it is absolutely smoke and mirrors.
[01:48:00.056 --> 01:48:08.158]  And they're kind of rolling this out right now, as they're telling you that Gitmo won't be closed down, but maybe we can move some people into the United States.
[01:48:08.158 --> 01:48:16.480]  This isn't going to close down Guantanamo Bay, it is just going to further the police state agenda in this country.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:17.580]  Exactly.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.520]  Exactly.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:25.102]  If I may, I want to step out on one more limb, and I'm sure this is going to draw some flashback, but I want people just to think about what I'm going to say.
[01:48:25.771 --> 01:48:41.448]  When a governmental administration takes a word like militia and starts to demonize it and synonymize it with things like white supremacist and hate group and hate crime and gay basher and all this other stuff, people they're trying to focus your attention away from what they're really doing.
[01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:47.875]  Every able-bodied man between the age of 16 and 65 is considered a nation's militia and as our citizenry, as the populace
[01:48:47.875 --> 01:48:48.035]  I'm good.
[01:49:04.245 --> 01:49:05.526]  So don't be fooled.
[01:49:05.526 --> 01:49:12.148]  And anytime they're attacking somebody in the media, they go after, you know, especially like they go after Alex or somebody else and say, oh, he's a crazy, he's a loony.
[01:49:12.148 --> 01:49:12.508]  You know what?
[01:49:12.508 --> 01:49:14.329]  That just means that you're on track.
[01:49:14.329 --> 01:49:21.511]  If you're being called a conspiracy theorist, if you're being called tinfoil hatter, you might want to redouble your efforts and check it out because you might just be on to something.
[01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:25.232]  You know, I generally, I'll be honest with you people and tell you that I generally don't subscribe to stuff like this.
[01:49:25.232 --> 01:49:28.213]  And ordinarily a year ago, I would have probably dismissed it.
[01:49:28.213 --> 01:49:29.894]  But here lately, after this new election,
[01:49:33.217 --> 01:49:35.138]  It is a time of preparation.
[01:49:35.138 --> 01:49:39.620]  It is a time of brotherhood and unification and American patriotism.
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:41.421]  We have to take this country back.
[01:49:41.421 --> 01:49:43.402]  If we don't we're voluntarily giving it away.
[01:49:43.928 --> 01:49:48.331]  It is astonishing how they have been able to roll out Youth Corps.
[01:49:48.331 --> 01:49:50.432]  They've been rolling out a carbon tax.
[01:49:50.432 --> 01:49:52.653]  They've rolled out the death of the dollar.
[01:49:52.653 --> 01:49:56.656]  They've rolled out more UN and global cooperation.
[01:49:56.656 --> 01:50:03.680]  And now they are rolling out privatized military forces on the streets of the United States of America.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.361]  And they are not shy, folks.
[01:50:05.361 --> 01:50:06.842]  They are putting a hardened
[01:50:07.122 --> 01:50:12.426]  Convicted, criminal, in charge, and they're giving him a nice American name, Hilton.
[01:50:12.426 --> 01:50:14.027]  Oh, he must be trustworthy.
[01:50:14.027 --> 01:50:28.597]  And then you look at all these aliases, and you look at how now the mainstream media in just a day, in just a day, is having to pick up on this story because of our great listeners, our great viewers out there at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:28.597 --> 01:50:32.559]  But just like Michael said, we have to redouble our efforts right now.
[01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:33.440]  Now is the time.
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:40.624]  To call your father, your brother, your sister, and let them know this is really happening in the United States of America.
[01:50:40.624 --> 01:50:43.065]  And it really supersedes administrations.
[01:50:43.065 --> 01:50:47.968]  They put this prison into play in 2007 under the Bush administration.
[01:50:47.968 --> 01:50:51.830]  It's going to become a hot zone under the Obama administration.
[01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:55.572]  One more segment with Michael Hollingsworth on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[01:50:55.572 --> 01:50:56.813]  Alex Jones coming up.
[01:50:56.813 --> 01:50:57.834]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:57.834 --> 01:51:00.055]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in InfoWars.com.
[01:51:01.001 --> 01:51:04.563]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:51:04.563 --> 01:51:14.168]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:51:14.168 --> 01:51:21.032]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:51:21.252 --> 01:51:34.762]  If you are ready to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[01:51:34.762 --> 01:51:40.566]  Here is what one satisfied customer had to say about Heart and Body Extract regarding his angina pain.
[01:51:40.566 --> 01:51:43.748]  I haven't had an angina pain since I've been on it.
[01:51:43.748 --> 01:51:46.110]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[01:51:46.110 --> 01:51:50.913]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me, and that can do so much for other people.
[01:51:51.173 --> 01:51:55.016]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:51:55.016 --> 01:51:56.417]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:56.417 --> 01:51:57.658]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:57.658 --> 01:52:02.921]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:02.921 --> 01:52:03.982]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[01:52:21.061 --> 01:52:26.285]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.285 --> 01:52:33.370]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:36.552]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.552 --> 01:52:41.656]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:42.316 --> 01:52:45.377]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:45.377 --> 01:52:51.439]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:52:51.439 --> 01:52:54.360]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:59.302]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:00.865 --> 01:53:09.949]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:19.853]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[01:54:09.107 --> 01:54:34.157]  Final segment with ex-military personnel Michael Hollingsworth who's on the scene at Hardin Montana really helped break this story yesterday and in this final segment I want to discuss how they used an economically destitute region to pull this off in your conversation with Becky Shea where she in no uncertain terms said hey this is what I was driving a week ago now that I've taken this job now I'm driving this
[01:54:35.959 --> 01:54:36.419]  Exactly.
[01:54:36.419 --> 01:54:40.082]  And the funny thing is that while Ms.
[01:54:40.082 --> 01:54:47.007]  Shea strikes me as a very nice lady, she also strikes me as someone who is just overtaken by the fact that they threw a check at her.
[01:54:47.007 --> 01:54:51.790]  When I asked her in the beginning of the conversation, I very candidly used the term targeted.
[01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:52.331]  I said, so Ms.
[01:54:52.331 --> 01:54:53.732]  Shea, essentially what you guys have done,
[01:54:54.432 --> 01:55:04.963]  As you went around and you targeted these really destitute towns, everything, she goes, well, I don't know so much that it was targeted was the word, but that we did an intense introspective financial analysis kind of thing.
[01:55:04.963 --> 01:55:07.226]  Which is, it's basically taken the power out of the word.
[01:55:07.226 --> 01:55:08.907]  But you know, it makes perfect sense.
[01:55:08.907 --> 01:55:10.229]  It makes absolutely perfect sense.
[01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:16.856]  If you want to destroy a nation from the inside out, the first thing you do is attack its financial infrastructure, because if it doesn't have money, it doesn't have anything.
[01:55:17.819 --> 01:55:24.681]  So you put these people out of their homes, you put them out of jobs, you put them out of everything they have, and then you make them much more dependent on the government handouts.
[01:55:24.681 --> 01:55:32.884]  You know, we saw this, you know, there's still, how much money of the financial bailout, wait a minute, do you mean the stimulus plan, that Obama put into effect that's unaccounted for?
[01:55:32.884 --> 01:55:36.746]  You know, now we're starting to see exactly how this whirlwind is starting to connect.
[01:55:36.746 --> 01:55:38.906]  All of them even follow that money, man.
[01:55:38.906 --> 01:55:43.768]  You know, so this is, how are they going to come in with multiple millions of dollars to rescue towns like Hardin?
[01:55:43.768 --> 01:55:44.448]  I don't know.
[01:55:44.448 --> 01:55:46.249]  With their provisions and that and the stimulus plan?
[01:55:46.909 --> 01:55:47.189]  Exactly.
[01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:48.290]  Hold on, identify.
[01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:55.413]  Yeah, see, now this is all the connections that's being made that people are finally starting to see, including the people that voted for Barack Obama.
[01:55:55.413 --> 01:56:02.757]  And I'm going to be bold and step out on a limb and I'm going to suggest that yes, this corruption may very well go all the way to the White House.
[01:56:02.757 --> 01:56:10.981]  So, you know, essentially what we're looking at right now is you're looking at a company that came in, they used a very, very well-planned but poorly executed
[01:56:12.407 --> 01:56:25.163]  Uh, network of people that came in, wanted to do this analysis, found out that the city of Hardin, and it's not just Hardin, there's several, she actually slipped and said that there were several other cities that they were looking at doing this in, although she wouldn't declare which ones they were.
[01:56:25.163 --> 01:56:28.588]  Okay, so they look at this, this is called establishing a strategic or tactical foothold.
[01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:39.959]  When you get into these places, you know, this facility that was obviously sub-code, it's a hardened structure, it has, you know, hundreds of strands of concertina wire, it's got a 10-foot fence, you know, that's a base of operation.
[01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:42.481]  That's called a FOB, or Forward Operating Base.
[01:56:42.481 --> 01:56:45.024]  You know, it's a place of security from which to conduct your operation.
[01:56:45.624 --> 01:56:54.308]  And then nobody sat back and went, well, how exactly is it that this thing was built at the $27 million bond referendum that the taxpayers picked up the tab for thinking that it was going to rescue their town?
[01:56:54.308 --> 01:57:04.413]  And then, miraculously, out of nowhere, this angelic company with no history floats in and promises millions upon millions that we're going to fix your town and we're going to have an animal shelter and a job fair and all this.
[01:57:04.913 --> 01:57:07.656]  You know, and we're going to give you medical coverage.
[01:57:07.656 --> 01:57:08.837]  Everything's going to be fine.
[01:57:08.837 --> 01:57:10.919]  We're here to help the community.
[01:57:10.919 --> 01:57:16.225]  Meanwhile, they have black SUVs running around with decals that say they're police officers.
[01:57:16.225 --> 01:57:17.886]  They're not police officers.
[01:57:17.886 --> 01:57:19.889]  It is beyond the pale.
[01:57:19.889 --> 01:57:22.291]  It is really like an episode of The Twilight Zone.
[01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:25.494]  But like I said, this is the new America.
[01:57:25.494 --> 01:57:26.916]  When you have a country that is now
[01:57:27.216 --> 01:57:32.440]  Praising communism and lighting the Empire State Building up in China's colors.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.761]  Watch out, folks.
[01:57:33.761 --> 01:57:35.482]  This is about globalization.
[01:57:35.482 --> 01:57:42.427]  This is about numbing you to foreign troops and mercenaries on the streets of America.
[01:57:42.427 --> 01:57:43.107]  Absolutely.
[01:57:43.107 --> 01:57:45.389]  I could not possibly say it better, guys.
[01:57:45.389 --> 01:57:50.632]  But like I said, right now, the critical things that we're stressing right now is network, network, network.
[01:57:50.632 --> 01:57:52.974]  Talk to everybody you can.
[01:57:52.974 --> 01:57:55.496]  American patriots, you are not alone.
[01:57:56.246 --> 01:58:04.535]  The National Institute for Justice released a statistic that said that 1,077,000 brand new firearms entered American homes in the month of August alone.
[01:58:04.535 --> 01:58:07.818]  That means that people are doing what they're supposed to do.
[01:58:07.818 --> 01:58:11.302]  They are practicing their constitutional rights within the boundaries of the law.
[01:58:11.302 --> 01:58:12.903]  The constitutional law, I should say.
[01:58:13.564 --> 01:58:16.246]  Okay, so people are waking up at a magnetomic rate.
[01:58:16.246 --> 01:58:19.167]  Now it's time to start getting your information together.
[01:58:19.167 --> 01:58:20.928]  Verify your information.
[01:58:20.928 --> 01:58:21.909]  Get your groups together.
[01:58:21.909 --> 01:58:23.610]  Think about preparation.
[01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:26.211]  You know, start thinking about what you can do to contact.
[01:58:26.211 --> 01:58:28.653]  And don't give up on contacting your elected officials.
[01:58:28.653 --> 01:58:29.693]  Don't.
[01:58:29.693 --> 01:58:30.353]  Absolutely not.
[01:58:30.353 --> 01:58:32.975]  We're going to be checking in throughout the week with Michael.
[01:58:32.975 --> 01:58:34.576]  So much more on the other side.
[01:58:34.576 --> 01:58:35.777]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:35.777 --> 01:58:36.757]  He's on the ground.
[01:58:36.757 --> 01:58:39.339]  I'm Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:46.743]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.743 --> 01:58:49.946]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:54.867]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.867 --> 01:58:56.869]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.869 --> 01:59:05.398]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.398 --> 01:59:10.943]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:12.565]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.805 --> 01:59:19.310]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:30.379]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.379 --> 01:59:31.760]  That's right, clean water.
[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:33.701]  Right from the air you breathe.

[02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:07.732]  Alex Jones on the ground at the FEMA camp.
[02:00:27.623 --> 02:00:27.663]  In
[02:00:45.359 --> 02:00:46.420]  We're good to go.
[02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:14.473]  into a hot police state, a visual police state, one where we will see mercenaries and military on the street regularly.
[02:01:14.473 --> 02:01:15.674]  That's not freedom.
[02:01:15.674 --> 02:01:18.015]  That's not the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:01:18.942 --> 02:01:21.564]  Alright, let's thank Ecoloblue.com.
[02:01:21.564 --> 02:01:23.166]  That's Ecoloblue.com.

[02:01:44.884 --> 02:01:46.986]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[02:01:47.746 --> 02:01:48.628]  It's unbelievable.

[02:01:54.334 --> 02:01:59.020]  And if you want to learn how to use a firearm, we cannot recommend Front Sight enough.
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:02.163]  That's FrontSight.com.
[02:02:02.163 --> 02:02:03.565]  FrontSight.com.
[02:02:04.466 --> 02:02:07.108]  I mean, these guys will teach you how to handle a firearm.
[02:02:07.108 --> 02:02:12.132]  You get a free weapon with a week's, I believe it's the week-long program of training.
[02:02:12.132 --> 02:02:15.775]  Go to FrontSight.com right now and check it out.
[02:02:15.775 --> 02:02:18.117]  Let's go to a couple callers before the break.
[02:02:18.117 --> 02:02:19.519]  Linda in California.
[02:02:19.519 --> 02:02:21.940]  Linda, you're on the line.
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:25.103]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:02:25.103 --> 02:02:27.545]  Okay, Shelly in Texas.
[02:02:27.545 --> 02:02:28.326]  Hi, can you hear me?
[02:02:29.269 --> 02:02:29.669]  Yes ma'am.
[02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:30.510]  Hello?
[02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:31.530]  Yes ma'am.
[02:02:31.530 --> 02:02:31.590]  Hi.
[02:02:31.590 --> 02:02:34.952]  Um, I have... Okay, I'm kind of nervous.
[02:02:34.952 --> 02:02:36.292]  I've been waiting for a while.
[02:02:36.292 --> 02:02:47.437]  Um, I've recently watched the videos and what you guys were talking about just a moment ago about the, um, about in Hardin, Hardin, uh, Montana.
[02:02:47.437 --> 02:02:55.881]  Um, one question that I have is I've heard only briefly something in regards to taking kids away
[02:02:56.738 --> 02:02:58.021]  From their parents.
[02:02:58.021 --> 02:03:00.667]  Something having to do with the vaccination.
[02:03:00.667 --> 02:03:04.296]  Do you have any further information on that?
[02:03:04.296 --> 02:03:05.999]  Because that's pretty much all that I heard.
[02:03:06.325 --> 02:03:11.489]  Well, they're saying that the article I just read out of Abilene, Texas, they're saying it's mandatory.
[02:03:11.489 --> 02:03:16.874]  They're saying that, yes, it will be an excused absence at first, but it may not last that long.
[02:03:16.874 --> 02:03:21.558]  And if they have 10 unexcused absences, then they're truant and they'll have to repeat the grade.
[02:03:21.558 --> 02:03:28.244]  And, of course, they've used truancy before to bring CPS in and say, oh, we need to come into your home or, oh, we need to take your children.
[02:03:28.524 --> 02:03:41.013]  So you have to be very careful, but at the same time, I'd rather battle CPS than battle autism from my child taking this, or some kind of a heart condition, or Gilliam's Bear, or them losing motion in their legs or arms.
[02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:41.753]  So you know what?
[02:03:41.753 --> 02:03:46.056]  No matter what, do not allow your child to take this shot.
[02:03:46.056 --> 02:03:47.417]  Look at this media hype!
[02:03:47.657 --> 02:03:55.320]  For this girl who died two hours, she dies two hours after she takes the shot for cervical cancer aka HPV.
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:57.441]  And now what is the mainstream media saying?
[02:03:57.441 --> 02:04:01.943]  Oh she didn't die from the injection, she had a tumor in her chest.
[02:04:01.943 --> 02:04:08.466]  As if that tumor was so fast acting that she died within the two hours she took this cervical cancer shot.
[02:04:08.806 --> 02:04:09.947]  It's unbelievable.
[02:04:09.947 --> 02:04:10.908]  It's unconscionable.
[02:04:10.908 --> 02:04:17.373]  And remember, they're pushing this on young children, they're pushing it on the parents, and they're pushing it on pregnant women.
[02:04:17.373 --> 02:04:22.537]  Meanwhile, health workers in Albany, New York, gathered in front of the Capitol to say, you know what?
[02:04:22.537 --> 02:04:24.118]  We don't want formaldehyde.
[02:04:24.118 --> 02:04:25.720]  We don't want squalene.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:28.482]  We don't want thimerosal with mercury in it.
[02:04:28.482 --> 02:04:29.883]  These are poisons.
[02:04:29.883 --> 02:04:32.445]  We should not be forcibly injected
[02:04:32.725 --> 02:04:33.526]  We're good to go.
[02:04:52.816 --> 02:04:54.118]  Totally against the Constitution.
[02:04:54.118 --> 02:04:55.299]  Totally against the Bill of Rights.
[02:04:55.299 --> 02:04:56.380]  We must stand up.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:57.562]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:57.562 --> 02:05:00.104]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in, back after these messages.
[02:05:00.104 --> 02:05:03.869]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.869 --> 02:05:07.493]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.493 --> 02:05:12.058]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.058 --> 02:05:13.480]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:16.583]  We provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.583 --> 02:05:22.708]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.708 --> 02:05:26.331]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.331 --> 02:05:31.155]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.155 --> 02:05:37.721]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.721 --> 02:05:39.663]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.143 --> 02:05:43.346]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.346 --> 02:05:47.851]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.851 --> 02:05:49.993]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:49.993 --> 02:05:50.053]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.053 --> 02:05:51.094]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:00.603 --> 02:06:08.346]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.346 --> 02:06:14.428]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[02:06:14.428 --> 02:06:17.089]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.389 --> 02:06:23.658]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.658 --> 02:06:27.743]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.743 --> 02:06:33.051]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.351 --> 02:06:35.433]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.433 --> 02:06:37.175]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.175 --> 02:06:39.718]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.718 --> 02:06:44.443]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.443 --> 02:06:48.147]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.147 --> 02:06:51.270]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:53.172]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:55.294]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:00.970 --> 02:07:03.972]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.972 --> 02:07:09.297]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.297 --> 02:07:11.358]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.358 --> 02:07:16.362]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:17.263]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.523 --> 02:07:18.644]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.644 --> 02:07:20.525]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.525 --> 02:07:21.606]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.606 --> 02:07:23.807]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.807 --> 02:07:25.148]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.148 --> 02:07:26.669]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:31.953]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.953 --> 02:07:35.535]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.535 --> 02:07:38.998]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.338 --> 02:07:40.559]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.559 --> 02:07:41.480]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:42.581]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.581 --> 02:07:43.501]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.501 --> 02:07:44.602]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.602 --> 02:07:47.664]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.664 --> 02:07:49.746]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:49.746 --> 02:07:55.190]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:55.190 --> 02:07:56.331]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:56.331 --> 02:08:06.499]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.499 --> 02:08:08.801]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.708 --> 02:08:13.788]  We are back live.
[02:08:13.788 --> 02:08:17.129]  It's the Alex Jones Show streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:17.129 --> 02:08:23.490]  Again, USA Today and the Boston Herald as well as the Associated Press have picked up on the story.
[02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:28.051]  We now go live to Alex Jones on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[02:08:28.051 --> 02:08:29.191]  Alex?
[02:08:29.191 --> 02:08:37.733]  Okay, we just got a term from Becky Shea, the former Billings Gazette reporter that's now the PR spokesperson for this facility for American Police Force.
[02:08:37.733 --> 02:08:39.633]  She admitted that it'll be a foreign
[02:08:40.834 --> 02:08:43.075]  paramilitary mercenary training facility.
[02:08:43.075 --> 02:08:47.097]  She admitted that it's going to be a detention facility.
[02:08:47.097 --> 02:08:50.478]  I saw some other things inside that I'll talk about in the last hour today.
[02:08:50.478 --> 02:08:53.699]  Once I'm out of here, I'll just leave it at that, to say the least.
[02:08:53.699 --> 02:08:58.301]  But the point is, is this is just off the charts.
[02:08:58.301 --> 02:09:00.642]  They're now doing massive damage control.
[02:09:00.642 --> 02:09:02.843]  They're about to give us a tour of the outside of the facility.
[02:09:02.843 --> 02:09:06.585]  I just got a tour of only one wing of this gigantic
[02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:08.771]  27 million dollar facility.
[02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:10.972]  They would not let us into most of the areas.
[02:09:10.972 --> 02:09:13.373]  Just while I was in some of the offices, I saw blueprints.
[02:09:13.373 --> 02:09:14.094]  I saw documents.
[02:09:14.094 --> 02:09:15.515]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:09:15.515 --> 02:09:17.576]  But this story is definitely the motherlode.
[02:09:17.576 --> 02:09:21.978]  This is definitely a black site slash ghost site in the United States.
[02:09:21.978 --> 02:09:25.040]  They plan to have this be a ghost site, but locals blew the whistle.
[02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:33.345]  They were definitely going to try to become the police through the Two Rivers Authority, basically taking over the town of Hardin.
[02:09:33.345 --> 02:09:37.187]  This individual is tied in with high-powered Serb operatives.
[02:09:37.187 --> 02:09:45.233]  His dad is some type of high-ranking Serb, Chetar, but he won't give anybody else's name.
[02:09:45.233 --> 02:09:47.434]  Then you have this Hilton character, again, that's a fake name.
[02:09:53.404 --> 02:09:54.004]  We're good to go.
[02:10:06.295 --> 02:10:08.737]  And we're going to get in the car with her and get a tour.
[02:10:08.737 --> 02:10:10.939]  She is very nice.
[02:10:10.939 --> 02:10:19.765]  She just got hired as the PR person, and I think it's pretty freaked out right now that all of this is happening because of their, you know, just incredible secrecy.
[02:10:19.765 --> 02:10:24.289]  We've had three different carloads now, a fourth and fifth pulling up of listeners.
[02:10:24.289 --> 02:10:25.790]  People are giving us thumbs up around town.
[02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:27.511]  We have a huge listenership here.
[02:10:27.511 --> 02:10:29.112]  So this is just amazing.
[02:10:29.112 --> 02:10:30.934]  But again, Becky has been...
[02:10:34.241 --> 02:10:34.741]  Very helpful.
[02:10:34.741 --> 02:10:35.882]  She's talking to some of the other folks.
[02:10:35.882 --> 02:10:37.262]  Hey folks, are you listening?
[02:10:37.262 --> 02:10:38.403]  Hey!
[02:10:38.403 --> 02:10:39.163]  Hey, nice to meet you.
[02:10:39.163 --> 02:10:39.743]  What's your name?
[02:10:39.743 --> 02:10:40.783]  Mike Keller.
[02:10:40.783 --> 02:10:41.644]  Mike, nice to meet you.
[02:10:41.644 --> 02:10:42.464]  Ma'am, what's your name?
[02:10:42.464 --> 02:10:43.264]  Tony Byer.
[02:10:43.264 --> 02:10:44.365]  Hey, Tony, nice to meet you.
[02:10:44.365 --> 02:10:45.945]  More and more listeners are arriving here.
[02:10:45.945 --> 02:10:48.646]  I have a lot of locals driving by giving us thumbs up.
[02:10:48.646 --> 02:10:53.508]  Becky has been extremely helpful, not shadowy like the other folks that have been running the facility.
[02:10:53.508 --> 02:10:55.589]  She took over as PR last Friday.
[02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:57.850]  She admitted it was only disclosed to her then and he's a 14-time felon.
[02:10:59.490 --> 02:11:03.013]  Uh, but again, this is one of the most dangerous missions we've ever been on ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:03.013 --> 02:11:06.355]  This is definitely a blank site, a ghost site we were planning to go live with.
[02:11:06.355 --> 02:11:10.018]  I have seen incontrovertible proof while inside the facility.
[02:11:10.018 --> 02:11:13.940]  And as you were saying, USA Today, AP, others are picking this up.
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:21.525]  Here's the deal, I want you to go to Steve Coyle, bring him up, and then we're going to leave this phone live as all these listeners are arriving.
[02:11:21.525 --> 02:11:26.429]  As we get through them in her car and get a live tour, then Karen will be fading live
[02:11:27.222 --> 02:11:29.365]  Uh, to her giving us a tour of the facility.
[02:11:29.365 --> 02:11:33.151]  Uh, just whenever you want, Jerry, whenever you think something's important, just fade it up.
[02:11:33.151 --> 02:11:35.294]  And we'll be getting a Steve Quayle quick take on this.
[02:11:35.294 --> 02:11:38.479]  He's also talked to Becky Shea, uh, the spokesman here.
[02:11:38.479 --> 02:11:40.923]  There's more TV media, uh, now arriving.
[02:11:40.923 --> 02:11:42.385]  I told everybody this was a key report.
[02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:46.665]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:48.046]  Are we still going to get that tour?
[02:11:48.046 --> 02:11:49.287]  Okay, we're going to come right back, guys.
[02:11:49.287 --> 02:11:51.068]  Or they can follow along if they want.
[02:11:51.068 --> 02:11:52.309]  We're going to get this tour on Saturday.
[02:11:52.309 --> 02:11:53.810]  Oh, you've already done the tour.
[02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:55.192]  You've done the tour.
[02:11:55.192 --> 02:11:56.653]  Okay, we've got a lot of media here.
[02:11:56.653 --> 02:11:58.034]  There was CBS News here earlier.
[02:12:06.627 --> 02:12:07.708]  Yes, absolutely Alex.
[02:12:07.708 --> 02:12:17.155]  I'd just like to also point out that one of our listeners did call in and contact Blackwater from Canada where he asked if there were any operations going on with Blackwater in Canada.
[02:12:17.155 --> 02:12:21.098]  He said no, but we are beginning operations in Montana.
[02:12:21.098 --> 02:12:22.399]  Yet more confirmation.
[02:12:26.394 --> 02:12:30.495]  Sure, we're going to go around the back of the facility and I'm going to bring up some landmarks, Jim.
[02:12:30.495 --> 02:12:31.736]  Okay, thank you.
[02:12:31.736 --> 02:12:35.757]  Let's go ahead and... Thanks for letting me visit with you today.
[02:12:35.757 --> 02:12:36.398]  It's very nice.
[02:12:36.398 --> 02:12:38.178]  Let's go ahead and bring Steve up right now.
[02:12:38.178 --> 02:12:40.479]  Steve, give us your take on the situation.
[02:12:40.479 --> 02:12:44.140]  Well, the situation, Alex, is as the press has broken on the...
[02:12:46.241 --> 02:12:46.722]  I think so.
[02:13:03.116 --> 02:13:10.860]  Uh, military up in the Canadian border area between Flathead, the Flathead Valley, and up to Eureka, Montana, etc.
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:27.287]  So the point is is that given the nature of, and by the way I talked to Becky Shea yesterday too, the lady you're talking to on the phone, and my film crew that I sent down there was down there yesterday, but obviously the situation that I think everyone's got to understand is you follow the money trail.
[02:13:27.287 --> 02:13:29.228]  It is my contention that we're seeing
[02:13:29.728 --> 02:13:36.937]  Uh, front men who are put out there that are willing to take the heat to, uh, hide the real ownership and the real purpose.
[02:13:36.937 --> 02:13:42.183]  You need to ask Becky what the, uh, 10,000 to 16,000 acres is going to be used for.
[02:13:42.183 --> 02:13:44.125]  She told us, she told us, Steve.
[02:13:44.125 --> 02:13:48.671]  She said that they are getting additional acres for an international paramilitary training facility.
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:14:03.966]  Well, again, ask her then who the international paramilitary is going to be trained for, because Alex, as you and I are on the radio right now, I'm getting people that are listening in to us saying that they're observing, and you flew into Billings.
[02:14:03.966 --> 02:14:05.427]  Did you fly into Billings?
[02:14:05.427 --> 02:14:11.909]  Yes, we've had locals tell us and call her to the show that they've seen black Envys, black Hawk helicopters, men training in the hills.
[02:14:14.375 --> 02:14:30.125]  And in the area that you are at, the thing that I think is really important for all the listeners is to realize that reservations have different rules and regulations, which allows a lot of foreign corporations and foreign military... Yes, it's just like Guantanamo.
[02:14:30.125 --> 02:14:31.866]  That's why they moved it there, because it's a no-man's land.
[02:14:31.866 --> 02:14:35.349]  Steve, I'm here getting a tour from Becky right now.
[02:14:35.349 --> 02:14:37.410]  I want to keep you for... I know we should be only here for 20 minutes.
[02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:38.471]  You're very busy.
[02:14:38.471 --> 02:14:40.152]  I'm going to be leaving in about 10 minutes.
[02:14:40.152 --> 02:14:43.614]  Can you give us a full report at the bottom of the hour since we're getting the tour right now?
[02:14:44.054 --> 02:14:51.522]  Sure, and Alex, are you, are you going to, uh, possibly, uh, uh, where you, well, call me off air, because I would like to get together with you.
[02:14:51.522 --> 02:14:54.305]  Yes, I made a call this morning that things started moving so fast.
[02:14:54.305 --> 02:14:58.930]  We are in, we are in one of the police, uh, vehicles that had the Hardin police.
[02:14:58.930 --> 02:14:59.811]  You're in my company.
[02:14:59.811 --> 02:15:02.954]  Yes, yes, yes, we're in the company car that did have the decals on it saying Hardin, correct?
[02:15:03.587 --> 02:15:04.027]  Correct?
[02:15:04.027 --> 02:15:05.668]  That is absolutely correct.
[02:15:05.668 --> 02:15:12.673]  Yes, yes, I am in one of the black Mercedes Benz SUVs inside the detention center right now.
[02:15:12.673 --> 02:15:17.537]  So, Steve, we're going to take it down to just a few minutes and come right back to you because we really want your analysis.
[02:15:17.537 --> 02:15:21.980]  Becky is going to be using the phone as a microphone so she can give us a live report.
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:23.821]  Becky, where are we right now?
[02:15:23.821 --> 02:15:29.125]  We are on the eastern side of Two Rivers Detention Facility.
[02:15:29.125 --> 02:15:30.846]  This is land that is owned by
[02:15:31.647 --> 02:15:34.868]  I'm with the Port Authority here in the City of Hardin.
[02:15:34.868 --> 02:15:38.028]  The facility and the land are owned by the City of Hardin.
[02:15:38.028 --> 02:15:50.110]  And I'm going to point out the boundaries of our land, where the boundaries are to our good neighbors, the Crow Indian Nation, and where we intend to do some construction on this property.
[02:15:50.110 --> 02:15:52.751]  Okay, and this facility is down there.
[02:15:52.751 --> 02:15:57.711]  Now, we're here in this big field on the back end of the Conventino wire.
[02:15:57.711 --> 02:16:00.732]  Is this where they're planning to build the International Military Training Facility?
[02:16:01.534 --> 02:16:01.954]  No, sir.
[02:16:01.954 --> 02:16:09.395]  And I want to make clear to, uh, hopefully I'm live, I want to make clear to everyone that the training facility is also for, you know, domestic.
[02:16:09.395 --> 02:16:16.937]  So you listeners out there, if you've got a police department, hometown group that needs some good quality training, we're going to be available to offer it to them, too.
[02:16:16.937 --> 02:16:17.317]  Sure.
[02:16:17.317 --> 02:16:19.637]  And, uh, what about Blackwater Connections?
[02:16:19.637 --> 02:16:22.258]  We've been hearing a lot about that in the company and in several places.
[02:16:22.258 --> 02:16:24.618]  Has BRAC, did they have Blackwater Connections?
[02:16:24.618 --> 02:16:28.219]  I've heard so many names that it's just absolutely phenomenal to me.
[02:16:28.752 --> 02:16:35.394]  We're not disclosing the name of our parent company, and that's it.
[02:16:35.394 --> 02:16:37.635]  We're not disclosing the name of our parent company.
[02:16:37.635 --> 02:16:40.916]  There's a parent company?
[02:16:40.916 --> 02:16:43.257]  There is a parent company of American Police Force?
[02:16:43.257 --> 02:16:44.718]  There is an umbrella company.
[02:16:44.718 --> 02:16:47.479]  American Police Force stands alone as a corporation.
[02:16:48.289 --> 02:16:49.491]  I don't think so.
[02:17:08.234 --> 02:17:10.216]  Alex, I've entrusted you and your crew.
[02:17:10.216 --> 02:17:11.758]  We've talked for what, now an hour?
[02:17:11.758 --> 02:17:12.539]  You were very nice.
[02:17:12.539 --> 02:17:13.900]  I think you were very nice, General.
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:16.543]  But, General, but, you know... No, let me finish.
[02:17:16.543 --> 02:17:18.105]  I think we've talked for about an hour.
[02:17:18.105 --> 02:17:26.674]  You've got the context, and I'm trusting you to explain to your audiences that, you know, this is my company car, and I'm...
[02:17:28.011 --> 02:17:30.993]  And just share with them all the information I've shared with you.
[02:17:30.993 --> 02:17:38.138]  But, Becky, there are newscasts where the locals and the people at American Police Force were saying they wanted this to be Guantanamo Bay West.
[02:17:38.138 --> 02:17:39.318]  That was on CNN.
[02:17:39.318 --> 02:17:44.101]  That was not American Police Force, and I'd ask you to go back and recheck your sources.
[02:17:44.101 --> 02:17:44.802]  That was too much.
[02:17:44.802 --> 02:17:47.964]  They've not been requesting to have this as a facility to hold detainees.
[02:17:47.964 --> 02:17:49.025]  No, sir.
[02:17:49.025 --> 02:17:50.866]  And please, everyone, listen carefully.
[02:17:51.386 --> 02:17:57.516]  Two Rivers Detention Facility will not hold Guantanamo BA nor other multinational offenders.
[02:17:57.516 --> 02:18:03.386]  We're a minimum and medium security... Why don't I see documents on the wall, blueprints, saying foreign alien detention facility?
[02:18:04.102 --> 02:18:06.124]  That's the former leasee who is here.
[02:18:06.124 --> 02:18:12.991]  You also saw documents on the wall that said civigenic surplus when CEC pulled out of this facility.
[02:18:12.991 --> 02:18:18.256]  They left everything from letterheads to two-year-old packages of mustard in my desk, Alex.
[02:18:18.256 --> 02:18:20.999]  Those people walked- Okay, we're going to skip this break, okay?
[02:18:20.999 --> 02:18:21.400]  Is that clear?
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:23.381]  We have time to skip the break?
[02:18:23.381 --> 02:18:23.742]  Genesis?
[02:18:25.233 --> 02:18:26.133]  Correct?
[02:18:26.133 --> 02:18:26.354]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:26.354 --> 02:18:27.214]  Are we live?
[02:18:27.214 --> 02:18:27.954]  Yes.
[02:18:27.954 --> 02:18:30.335]  Okay, we're skipping this break right now.
[02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:33.217]  Steve Quayle, we're going to go back to Becky here in just a moment.
[02:18:33.217 --> 02:18:40.820]  I'm going to hand the phone to her, Steve, for any questions you've got for Becky, the spokesperson for America Police Force here in Arden at the detention facility.
[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:42.881]  We are on the property right now.
[02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:43.461]  Here is Becky.
[02:18:43.461 --> 02:18:44.682]  You wanted to talk to Steve Quayle, Becky.
[02:18:44.682 --> 02:18:46.683]  Here you are, live on the radio.
[02:18:46.683 --> 02:18:51.785]  Unfortunately, Steven Quayle has dropped... Oh, Steve Quayle dropped on us.
[02:18:52.614 --> 02:18:57.940]  Would one of you gentlemen get out and tell the fine-hearted citizens behind me that we're going to talk to them?
[02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:00.002]  We're going to get out of the car and talk to them real soon?
[02:19:00.002 --> 02:19:03.145]  I don't care which one of you does it, but... Okay, I thought Steve was going to hold it.
[02:19:03.145 --> 02:19:04.267]  We'll call him back in ten minutes.
[02:19:04.267 --> 02:19:05.328]  You know what, Becky?
[02:19:05.328 --> 02:19:08.631]  I want you to be able to make whatever statement you want, Ben.
[02:19:08.631 --> 02:19:10.093]  As you give us a tour, you've got the phone.
[02:19:10.473 --> 02:19:10.793]  All right.
[02:19:10.793 --> 02:19:11.554]  You're live.
[02:19:11.554 --> 02:19:18.357]  I apologize because I'm going to get out in the lovely eastern Montana wind, and so you might hear some of that in the background.
[02:19:18.357 --> 02:19:31.004]  Two Rivers Detention Facility is owned, was built and is owned by Two Rivers Authority, which is the port authority that was created under Montana law as the economic development wing of the City of Hardin.
[02:19:32.431 --> 02:19:39.976]  This facility is built for, is accredited for, and has the authority for, and will only
[02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:43.968]  Minimum and medium security offenders.
[02:19:43.968 --> 02:19:48.571]  And those, under the authorities, are how we're allowed to operate.
[02:19:48.571 --> 02:19:53.954]  Those offenders can only come from local, state, and federal jurisdictions.
[02:19:53.954 --> 02:19:56.015]  So that might be another county in Montana.
[02:19:56.015 --> 02:20:00.618]  That might be the state you're listening in right now.
[02:20:00.618 --> 02:20:05.241]  If they need to make that connection, then we can make that connection.
[02:20:07.612 --> 02:20:15.496]  Right now, we're trying to open a 100,000 square foot detention facility that's been shuttered for two years.
[02:20:15.496 --> 02:20:21.980]  Now, when we kind of cut out there, Alex was saying to me he saw some documents in the building.
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.841]  My explanation for that was
[02:20:24.501 --> 02:20:30.066]  The former contractee that was going to operate this facility had some plans.
[02:20:30.066 --> 02:20:34.070]  When they walked away from Hardin, they dropped everything and they walked away.
[02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:43.079]  They left everything from mustard packets and plastic spoons and crumbs and dust drawers to the documents that Alex was referring to, to letterhead.
[02:20:43.686 --> 02:20:46.369]  So right now, as we come in, we're doing a couple things.
[02:20:46.369 --> 02:20:55.039]  We're cleaning this place head to toe, and we're making sure that it's ready for whoever comes in and contracts to hold offenders here.
[02:20:55.039 --> 02:20:58.163]  And I want to make it clear that that's always going to be local control.
[02:20:58.163 --> 02:21:04.189]  It's always going to be the people of Hardin who have the final say on what offenders are held here.
[02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:10.414]  And they will be only minimum and medium security offenders.
[02:21:10.414 --> 02:21:17.139]  And now, I'm going to give this phone back to Alex, who's been visiting with my neighbors Taryn Harden, and we're going to give the nickel to her.
[02:21:17.139 --> 02:21:21.322]  But I'm going to give the phone back to you, Alex, so that I can accommodate my other guests, okay?
[02:21:23.896 --> 02:21:30.841]  Alex, I just want to point out that our intel is pointing to the parent company being called DPS.
[02:21:30.841 --> 02:21:34.363]  That's a story we're developing right now at the moment.
[02:21:34.363 --> 02:21:35.344]  DPS.
[02:21:35.344 --> 02:21:36.444]  DPS.
[02:21:36.444 --> 02:21:37.625]  DPS.
[02:21:37.625 --> 02:21:38.966]  DPS, sir.
[02:21:38.966 --> 02:21:41.308]  Okay, it's very hard to hear you in this wind.
[02:21:41.308 --> 02:21:42.408]  Say it slowly.
[02:21:42.408 --> 02:21:43.649]  DPS.
[02:21:43.649 --> 02:21:45.450]  And there are links on the forum.
[02:21:45.450 --> 02:21:47.352]  Is that P as in donkey?
[02:21:47.352 --> 02:21:48.172]  Yes, yes.
[02:21:48.172 --> 02:21:49.233]  DPS, sir.
[02:21:53.055 --> 02:21:54.256]  Yes, yes.
[02:21:54.256 --> 02:21:57.717]  Becky, is the parent company DPS?
[02:21:57.717 --> 02:22:00.118]  We are not releasing the name of the parent company.
[02:22:00.118 --> 02:22:02.439]  APF is the one.
[02:22:02.439 --> 02:22:06.821]  APF is the corporation that publicly filed for permission to shell.
[02:22:06.821 --> 02:22:09.463]  Well, hey, now there's a way.
[02:22:09.463 --> 02:22:12.044]  Uh, Burmas, listen, I wanted Quayle to be able to ask her question.
[02:22:12.044 --> 02:22:12.724]  That's why I got him on.
[02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:13.985]  Is he coming back at the bottom of the hour?
[02:22:13.985 --> 02:22:15.465]  Uh, I believe so.
[02:22:15.465 --> 02:22:16.266]  Jaren's saying yes.
[02:22:17.492 --> 02:22:20.835]  Okay, well, I wanted to have him stay on hold so he could comment.
[02:22:20.835 --> 02:22:23.017]  But I just want to point out, he was right about this last week.
[02:22:23.017 --> 02:22:26.740]  He was the one saying it was the felon, even before that was anywhere, he was the one.
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:33.747]  And that's the thing about Steve, you know, sometimes it sounds wild, but in my case, it just always turns out to be true when it's political.
[02:22:36.118 --> 02:22:37.219]  This is wild, Berman.
[02:22:37.219 --> 02:22:37.800]  This is crazy.
[02:22:54.654 --> 02:22:57.458]  So that is in the first paragraph of USA Today.
[02:22:57.458 --> 02:22:59.220]  We are checking our sources here.
[02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:00.562]  It's right in front of me.
[02:23:00.562 --> 02:23:09.534]  And again, I think that they're using this Guantanamo prisoners excuse to say, yes, this will be a training facility for foreign troops and mercenary operations.
[02:23:09.534 --> 02:23:10.015]  That is an excuse.
[02:23:10.015 --> 02:23:12.058]  It is going to be Guantanamo West, and I want to be clear.
[02:23:12.742 --> 02:23:20.527]  You know, we've been reporting this since Sunday, and Monday and Tuesday, and then on Wednesday and Thursday, into Thursday, and people were in denial.
[02:23:20.527 --> 02:23:23.048]  They said it was fake when we broke the MIAC report.
[02:23:23.048 --> 02:23:25.270]  They said it was fake when we broke the DHS report.
[02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:27.731]  They said it was fake when we broke that we were under level 6 in April.
[02:23:27.731 --> 02:23:29.993]  Two months later, it was admitted to mainstream news.
[02:23:29.993 --> 02:23:31.774]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't make stuff up.
[02:23:31.774 --> 02:23:32.815]  This is real.
[02:23:32.815 --> 02:23:35.816]  This is a ghost site slash black site that we have on.
[02:23:36.857 --> 02:23:39.039]  This is a FEMA center they want to hold.
[02:23:39.039 --> 02:23:42.142]  She was telling me, I saw blueprints all over the place, scanning them quickly.
[02:23:42.142 --> 02:23:46.526]  I was walking into the facility and she'd say, oh don't tape that, or don't, you know, don't show that.
[02:23:46.526 --> 02:23:52.971]  Where it was saying alien detention, uh, you know, uh, you know, troop barracks, processing facilities.
[02:23:52.971 --> 02:24:01.119]  She admitted they're going to do training to process people and to go out and set up checkpoints with CAT scan scanners, is the way she calls them, scan people's goods.
[02:24:01.119 --> 02:24:02.400]  So this is a huge
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:05.241]  I don't think she even knows everything.
[02:24:05.241 --> 02:24:06.342]  She seems pretty freaked out.
[02:24:06.342 --> 02:24:12.545]  She gets hired, finds out all this, and all the Serbs and the Germans and the Brits have all fled.
[02:24:12.545 --> 02:24:14.566]  But I was pretty smart.
[02:24:14.566 --> 02:24:18.428]  We went and interviewed bed and breakfasts, because there's hardly any hotels here.
[02:24:18.428 --> 02:24:22.330]  So we went to the one hotel, the one Motel 8, two of those.
[02:24:22.330 --> 02:24:25.872]  We went to three different bed and breakfasts at two of the places.
[02:24:25.872 --> 02:24:26.912]  They said, oh, absolutely.
[02:24:26.912 --> 02:24:29.834]  Germans, Czechs, Brits.
[02:24:31.041 --> 02:24:32.862]  Uh, a lot of Serbs.
[02:24:32.862 --> 02:24:34.942]  Uh, really hardcore looking people.
[02:24:34.942 --> 02:24:36.083]  Won't pay in cash.
[02:24:36.083 --> 02:24:37.023]  Act really suspicious.
[02:24:37.023 --> 02:24:38.564]  They've been here for a year.
[02:24:38.564 --> 02:24:42.045]  I mean, this is insane, what we're dealing with up here.
[02:24:42.045 --> 02:24:43.785]  And they're just trying to act like it's all fine.
[02:24:43.785 --> 02:24:45.106]  We're not going to kill your apparent company.
[02:24:45.106 --> 02:24:45.846]  Everything's fine.
[02:24:45.846 --> 02:24:47.006]  Everything's wonderful.
[02:24:47.006 --> 02:24:48.827]  I mean, this is bizarro land.
[02:24:48.827 --> 02:24:52.008]  And then they try to start patrolling the town with their vehicles.
[02:24:52.008 --> 02:24:53.108]  That blew up in their face.
[02:24:53.108 --> 02:24:54.469]  Uh, this is insane.
[02:24:55.319 --> 02:25:02.520]  Well, you know, another question I would ask her is if those documents indeed are contracted by a different entity that is no longer involved.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:03.561]  What entity is that?
[02:25:03.561 --> 02:25:05.461]  Surely she can tell you who that is.
[02:25:05.461 --> 02:25:13.102]  If she can't disclose... She won't disclose who the people who were going to make this Guantanamo West were, even though those documents were up everywhere.
[02:25:13.102 --> 02:25:16.943]  She's saying that they left these documents at quote-unquote mustard packets.
[02:25:16.943 --> 02:25:18.623]  She won't say what company that is.
[02:25:18.623 --> 02:25:22.364]  Why protect a company that's no longer involved in this detention center, Alex?
[02:25:27.699 --> 02:25:30.520]  This is just so incredible and so fast-moving.
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:33.241]  Again, within the past couple hours, the Associated Press...
[02:25:41.949 --> 02:25:46.532]  Uh, running it, admitting they want to expand it at a 15,000 other acre facility they want to build.
[02:25:46.532 --> 02:25:49.273]  There's a British architect here in town designing it.
[02:25:49.273 --> 02:25:51.194]  This is the real deal, okay?
[02:25:51.194 --> 02:25:57.658]  This is a real live, ghost site FEMA camp in the making, on a silver platter, for everyone.
[02:25:57.658 --> 02:25:59.359]  This is the shadow government system.
[02:25:59.859 --> 02:26:04.063]  As all the old intel people told us decades ago, they said they will be run by foreign mercs.
[02:26:04.063 --> 02:26:11.891]  Everything the old militia guy said is absolutely true because they were all in the military, they were all in intelligence, they were all in African, Asian, Latin American, the Middle East.
[02:26:11.891 --> 02:26:13.293]  It's all how it was done there.
[02:26:13.293 --> 02:26:14.934]  And that is exactly what's being set up.
[02:26:16.476 --> 02:26:18.618]  No, because it's so poor, so they can take it over.
[02:26:18.618 --> 02:26:21.900]  They have this Two Rivers Authority muscling around.
[02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:24.542]  The former director of this place's wife's running for mayor.
[02:26:24.542 --> 02:26:25.623]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:26:25.623 --> 02:26:26.944]  And it is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:27.905]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:26:27.905 --> 02:26:30.887]  Because they do have operators and people following us.
[02:26:30.887 --> 02:26:33.289]  We've been getting followed by white sedans.
[02:26:33.289 --> 02:26:36.271]  When we try to go and videotape them, they speed off.
[02:26:36.271 --> 02:26:38.673]  So this is serious business here in Arden, Montana.
[02:26:39.764 --> 02:26:42.446]  And Steve Quayle going to come up in the bottom of the hour.
[02:26:42.446 --> 02:26:44.727]  He'd like to break some news with you, Alex.
[02:26:44.727 --> 02:26:48.290]  So hopefully you'll be able to join us in another 20 or 25 minutes.
[02:26:48.290 --> 02:26:49.390]  It is incredible.
[02:26:49.390 --> 02:27:01.418]  Once again, we have somebody who is a convicted felon who has over a dozen aliases, who has a over a dozen felony convictions, who is a million plus in the hole from civil suits.
[02:27:01.418 --> 02:27:09.584]  He's lost a person who has presented himself as an arts dealer, a person who has presented himself as a car salesman, as an entrepreneur, as a restaurant owner.
[02:27:09.884 --> 02:27:14.487]  And a foreign merc... It blows my mind, Alex.
[02:27:14.487 --> 02:27:16.269]  This is who the New World Order uses.
[02:27:16.269 --> 02:27:20.211]  This is the shady criminals, 14-time felons they use as cut-out fronts.
[02:27:20.211 --> 02:27:25.275]  The New World Order is a criminal, rogue government operation to rape the hell out of the American people and people of the planet.
[02:27:25.275 --> 02:27:29.818]  If they greased 1,300,000 Iraqis, they'll do it here too, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:29.818 --> 02:27:31.039]  That's why they staged the terror.
[02:27:31.039 --> 02:27:32.040]  That's why they do all of this.
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:33.201]  That's what this country's run by.
[02:27:33.201 --> 02:27:34.922]  It's criminals looting the hell out of us.
[02:27:35.754 --> 02:27:37.955]  And it continues and continues and continues.
[02:27:37.955 --> 02:27:42.837]  And again, this facility started in 2007 under the Bush administration.
[02:27:42.837 --> 02:27:45.638]  They waited for the Obama administration to come in.
[02:27:45.638 --> 02:27:49.120]  As the economy is gutted, now they're saying... Obama is looking at Montana.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:50.200]  Two different facilities.
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.120]  This one and that one.
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:52.481]  Oh my Christ.
[02:27:52.481 --> 02:27:55.042]  Yes, and they're integrating again.
[02:27:55.042 --> 02:27:59.424]  I am at a triple-confirmed Merck-run facility.
[02:28:00.524 --> 02:28:01.104]  Just unbelievable Alex.
[02:28:21.027 --> 02:28:27.134]  And I'm sure it will be confirmed that Blackwater is involved within the week, if not within the next couple of days.
[02:28:27.134 --> 02:28:34.984]  Again, we are encouraging... I'm just saying in a story that I believe from memory I might have heard in the middle of a concentration camp field, that it's confirmed Blackwater.
[02:28:34.984 --> 02:28:36.706]  The AFP brags they work with Blackwater.
[02:28:37.086 --> 02:28:38.007]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:28:38.007 --> 02:28:44.834]  From the screenshots and them trying to take certain links off their website, it becomes irrefutable.
[02:28:44.834 --> 02:28:54.905]  And now, again, we're having listeners call in with double confirmation saying they have contacted Blackwater and they have confirmed that they do have units moving into Montana as we speak.
[02:28:55.930 --> 02:28:57.530]  It's not just Steve saying that.
[02:28:57.530 --> 02:28:59.771]  I have people at grocery stores telling me.
[02:28:59.771 --> 02:29:02.192]  I have people that run bed and breakfasts telling me this.
[02:29:02.192 --> 02:29:08.513]  I have listeners calling in going, yeah, you drive along and there's troops crawling all around the side of the road and up the hills, and there's helicopters.
[02:29:08.513 --> 02:29:11.954]  But then I go in another bed and breakfast this morning, knock on the door, and a lady invites me in for coffee.
[02:29:11.954 --> 02:29:15.015]  She goes, yeah, I go out and look for dinosaur bones and pig flowers.
[02:29:17.145 --> 02:29:20.227]  And the Blackhawks fly right over.
[02:29:20.227 --> 02:29:23.088]  She said, this just happened to me last week, just right outside town.
[02:29:23.088 --> 02:29:26.710]  Because there's all these Indian arrowheads and fossils, as you're showing us.
[02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:28.651]  Dinosaur holes, fossils she found and stuff.
[02:29:28.651 --> 02:29:33.274]  Dinosaur teeth, dinosaur gallstones.
[02:29:33.274 --> 02:29:34.234]  All this crazy stuff.
[02:29:34.234 --> 02:29:36.035]  And everybody we talk to is being harassed.
[02:29:36.035 --> 02:29:37.636]  This whole place is crawling.
[02:29:37.636 --> 02:29:39.877]  And this is real!
[02:29:39.877 --> 02:29:42.179]  Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[02:29:42.179 --> 02:29:42.979]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:42.979 --> 02:29:43.980]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:45.881]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:51.627 --> 02:29:53.010]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.010 --> 02:29:54.614]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.614 --> 02:29:58.242]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.811 --> 02:30:05.055]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.055 --> 02:30:07.077]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.077 --> 02:30:15.585]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.585 --> 02:30:21.150]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:22.772]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.992 --> 02:30:29.495]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.495 --> 02:30:40.559]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.559 --> 02:30:41.319]  That's right.
[02:30:41.319 --> 02:30:43.900]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[02:30:45.961 --> 02:30:46.842]  Or visit Ecola Blue
[02:30:52.864 --> 02:30:54.185]  We're good to go.

[02:32:03.294 --> 02:32:05.875]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[02:32:06.368 --> 02:32:08.989]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[02:32:08.989 --> 02:32:12.751]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[02:32:12.751 --> 02:32:19.453]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[02:32:19.453 --> 02:32:23.335]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[02:32:23.335 --> 02:32:27.697]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[02:32:27.697 --> 02:32:31.298]  Nutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct, your new comfort food.
[02:32:31.298 --> 02:32:32.619]  Incredible taste, easy to
[02:32:36.886 --> 02:32:37.346]  I think so.
[02:33:07.108 --> 02:33:08.051]  Uh-huh.
[02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:17.104]  We are here at the Hardin Detention Facility in Hardin, Montana.
[02:33:17.104 --> 02:33:21.447]  We have Becky Shea, the spokesman for American Police Force, here at this detention facility.
[02:33:21.447 --> 02:33:32.195]  Steve Quill has major breaking news he's going to cover after he talks to Becky Shea, but I wanted to invite Steve on today because he originally really broke this, and he broke the felonies last Friday when he called me.
[02:33:32.195 --> 02:33:35.017]  I was so busy I didn't get on my radar screen until Sunday.
[02:33:35.017 --> 02:33:39.080]  It didn't break officially in mainstream news to the Billings Gazette yesterday.
[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:46.503]  Uh, and so it's on the front page of the Billings Gazette again today, that this Serb gentleman, uh, is this 14-time felon.
[02:33:46.503 --> 02:33:53.265]  But I wanted to let Steve be able to talk to Becky Shea, because she's been very, very helpful, and has not been secretive like the other folks out here.
[02:33:53.265 --> 02:34:05.010]  So, uh, I wanted to hand the phone to her for five minutes, and Steve Quayle's going to give us huge breaking news and developments, and then we'll throw it back to Jason Berman, and I'll call in later in the next hour to recap this after the tour is complete.
[02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:07.391]  Uh, Steve Quayle, here is Becky Shea.
[02:34:07.391 --> 02:34:07.891]  Hi, Becky.
[02:34:08.593 --> 02:34:10.694]  Hey Steve, we were supposed to talk today.
[02:34:10.694 --> 02:34:13.675]  What a strange way to do it on Alex's phone, huh?
[02:34:13.675 --> 02:34:15.776]  Well, yeah, that's wonderful and thank you so much.
[02:34:15.776 --> 02:34:19.258]  Here's some of the questions that I think really need to be answered, okay?
[02:34:19.258 --> 02:34:31.543]  There has seemed to be a systematic effort to hide the true ownership, and I understand DPS, I understand the attorney Maziar Mopi, you know, describing the Santa Ana, California ownership, etc.
[02:34:31.543 --> 02:34:36.045]  But when you go to Angelino, or Eddie Angelino, have you ever met with him personally?
[02:34:37.245 --> 02:34:46.510]  No, Steve, I haven't, and I just want to let you know that, and just to be fair, I'm telling you up front, and I hope your listeners, you know, are we on the air?
[02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:48.271]  Are your listeners here with us?
[02:34:48.271 --> 02:34:49.732]  I just had Alex hand me a phone.
[02:34:49.732 --> 02:34:50.873]  I don't know who I'm talking to.
[02:34:50.873 --> 02:34:51.933]  Yes, we're on the air.
[02:34:51.933 --> 02:34:52.754]  Okay, we're on the air.
[02:34:52.754 --> 02:34:55.375]  I am not going to release
[02:34:57.409 --> 02:35:01.871]  The name of anyone we're affiliated with.
[02:35:01.871 --> 02:35:05.393]  And I know some of, you know, I've visited with Mr. Moffey.
[02:35:05.393 --> 02:35:10.255]  The other name that you mentioned is not a name that I recognize.
[02:35:10.255 --> 02:35:13.397]  I can speak and will only speak for APF.
[02:35:13.397 --> 02:35:18.079]  I can't speak to other corporations that you've visited with.
[02:35:18.079 --> 02:35:20.620]  The other thing that I want to let your listeners know
[02:35:22.785 --> 02:35:23.406]  I don't know.
[02:35:37.938 --> 02:35:40.298]  Then me and my laptop in this car.
[02:35:40.298 --> 02:35:47.040]  Well, I gotta tell you then, Becky, that contradicts multiple eyewitnesses that said initially there were 12 and then it went down to 3.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:53.241]  And I have posted on my website the actual photographs of the seal that said American Police Force.
[02:35:53.241 --> 02:35:54.761]  And so here's the question.
[02:35:54.761 --> 02:36:01.923]  Let me clarify for you that the seals were magnetic blockers that are gone.
[02:36:02.603 --> 02:36:13.498]  And I challenge you, and respectfully Steve, I really do, I challenge you respectfully to find good proof that there were twelve vehicles in this town.
[02:36:13.498 --> 02:36:16.722]  Only three came into town and I got one of them.
[02:36:16.722 --> 02:36:17.844]  Okay, forgive me.
[02:36:17.844 --> 02:36:19.266]  That's why we're talking, Becky.
[02:36:20.615 --> 02:36:26.278]  With all due respect to your sources, there were not 12 APS vehicles in this town.
[02:36:26.278 --> 02:36:28.299]  Okay, now let's go to the issue.
[02:36:28.299 --> 02:36:31.821]  The privatization of Police Force and Harden, okay?
[02:36:31.821 --> 02:36:47.649]  The idea was that there were those decals and obviously someone gave the order to take them off because it was causing controversy when apparently, and since you won't discuss the ownership of the company, and I respect that, okay?
[02:36:48.109 --> 02:37:01.619]  But I'm only going to tell you that there's independent verification that has been supplied to both Alex Jones and myself from people in the law enforcement community showing... No, it's Defense Product Solutions.
[02:37:01.619 --> 02:37:03.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:09.804]  Foreign ownership and aliases used that would, I think, make most Americans go, there's something going on.
[02:37:09.804 --> 02:37:12.146]  Now, are you familiar with the main reason why?
[02:37:12.586 --> 02:37:19.670]  Alex, myself and others are concerned when we hear about the privatization and the takeover of police forces in America.
[02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:20.710]  Let me explain.
[02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:22.951]  Let's talk about that privatization issue, okay?
[02:37:22.951 --> 02:37:23.151]  Okay.
[02:37:30.575 --> 02:37:39.326]  Under Montana law, the only entity that can provide law enforcement services is local government.
[02:37:43.047 --> 02:37:47.750]  Steve, are you getting it that another cutout is defense product solutions out of Karachi, Pakistan?
[02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:52.313]  Because that's where the website goes to American Police Force.
[02:37:52.313 --> 02:37:54.814]  Yeah, and when I say it to Becky, her eyes light up.
[02:37:54.814 --> 02:37:58.336]  That is an additional cutout for Kuwait, okay?
[02:37:58.336 --> 02:38:00.498]  And just, I want to put Becky on notice, Becky.
[02:38:00.498 --> 02:38:02.579]  Not on notice, but I just want to give you information.
[02:38:02.579 --> 02:38:04.380]  I'm going to hand you back over to her, Steve.
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:05.441]  I'm going to hand you back over.
[02:38:05.441 --> 02:38:06.643]  I just wanted to get that out right now.
[02:38:06.643 --> 02:38:10.349]  Folks, this is mega huge because this is the plan for the whole United States.
[02:38:10.349 --> 02:38:17.960]  And Becky, isn't it true that I've seen you quote in the news and talking to folks on the phone that I've talked to that the American police force does plan other facilities around the country?
[02:38:20.014 --> 02:38:31.941]  Okay, first of all, I want to explain to people that I have a face for radio, and when Alex came over here and leaned in and yelled into the phone to Steve, my face lit up because I just thought it was funnier than I'll get out.
[02:38:31.941 --> 02:38:36.384]  That's the only- I just looked at you and went, oh my god- There's no Serbs, there's no Muslims, everything's fine.
[02:38:37.824 --> 02:38:41.507]  You know, you're just talking to a nice Montana girl right now.
[02:38:41.507 --> 02:38:42.948]  Steve, let me get back on topic.
[02:38:42.948 --> 02:38:44.409]  I'm a nice Montana boy!
[02:38:44.409 --> 02:38:45.150]  I know you are!
[02:38:45.150 --> 02:38:46.311]  That's why we're talking!
[02:38:46.311 --> 02:38:49.694]  I want to get back on topic for just a minute.
[02:38:49.694 --> 02:38:58.802]  If you would please give me the opportunity to respond to the question that we were on when Alex came over and crocked me up.
[02:38:58.802 --> 02:39:01.804]  We were talking about what I was saying was the only
[02:39:03.608 --> 02:39:10.371]  The only way that law enforcement services can be delivered in Montana is through a local governmental entity.
[02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:13.692]  Now, that's the city of Hardin.
[02:39:13.692 --> 02:39:20.154]  And I'm sure you understand, and I think your Montana listeners understand it, but your audience is much larger than that.
[02:39:20.154 --> 02:39:24.956]  So give me three minutes to explain the context of why Hardin doesn't have a police force.
[02:39:24.956 --> 02:39:26.917]  Do we have time to do that?
[02:39:26.917 --> 02:39:27.957]  Absolutely.
[02:39:27.957 --> 02:39:29.097]  Okay.
[02:39:29.097 --> 02:39:29.457]  Back in 1976,
[02:39:31.593 --> 02:39:41.636]  Hardin and Bighorn County took advantage or used the structure allowed under Montana law to consolidate their law enforcement services.
[02:39:41.636 --> 02:39:51.319]  By doing so, the Sheriff's Office provides all of the law enforcement within the City of Hardin in addition to all of Bighorn County.
[02:39:51.319 --> 02:39:58.842]  There have been negotiations between the City and County most recently that have come to the point that they are
[02:40:00.097 --> 02:40:06.499]  are choosing to deconsolidate law enforcement and Hardin will create its own police department.
[02:40:06.499 --> 02:40:08.339]  Now, folks, think about it.
[02:40:08.339 --> 02:40:15.842]  It is incredibly expensive to create, to develop, to build from the ground up a police department.
[02:40:15.842 --> 02:40:21.123]  And this community is going to try and do that in one of the poorest counties in the state of Montana.
[02:40:21.123 --> 02:40:23.144]  So that amplifies the challenges.
[02:40:23.874 --> 02:40:35.045]  This summer when TRA, Two Rivers Authority Hardened Economic Development Arm, was working with representatives of APS2, Alex was laying in at me again and I jumped.
[02:40:35.045 --> 02:40:37.107]  Ricky, hold on one second, hold on one second.
[02:40:37.107 --> 02:40:47.638]  Steve, I just want to bring up Article 2, Section 33 of the Montana Incorporation as a state and a legislature and a duly convened powers of the people in the sovereign state of Montana in the United States.
[02:40:48.238 --> 02:41:00.003]  It says, importation of armed persons, no armed person or persons of armed body of men shall be brought into the state for the preservation of peace or the suppression of domestic violence is stepped upon application of the legislature or of the governor.
[02:41:00.003 --> 02:41:03.284]  The legislature cannot be convened for further, and then it goes on.
[02:41:03.664 --> 02:41:05.385]  Now, here's the issue.
[02:41:05.385 --> 02:41:07.426]  They did put the decals on the cars.
[02:41:07.426 --> 02:41:12.370]  The head of the Port Authority, as they call it, two rivers, has said that it's a wish list.
[02:41:12.370 --> 02:41:14.611]  You know, the point is you've got a 14-time felon.
[02:41:14.611 --> 02:41:15.692]  You've got all this secrecy.
[02:41:15.692 --> 02:41:17.273]  They won't tell us who the owner of the company is.
[02:41:17.273 --> 02:41:26.579]  Becky, you're nice to talk to us and we appreciate it, but people are concerned and freaked out about all of this because every red flag you could push up is popping up.
[02:41:26.579 --> 02:41:27.679]  We've got Arabs.
[02:41:27.679 --> 02:41:28.580]  We've got Serbs.
[02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:29.480]  We've got Germans.
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:30.201]  We've got Brits.
[02:41:30.641 --> 02:41:32.702]  Crawling all over the place around here.
[02:41:32.702 --> 02:41:33.943]  The people are freaking out.
[02:41:33.943 --> 02:41:37.165]  I mean, is this some type of Red Dawn scenario, Becky?
[02:41:37.165 --> 02:41:43.269]  Alex, if you could have taken the phone away from me, you'd know that we were already talking about that.
[02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:45.950]  Stay and listen, or leave me alone, buddy.
[02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:46.851]  Come on!
[02:41:46.851 --> 02:41:48.292]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:41:48.292 --> 02:41:48.472]  So...
[02:41:49.259 --> 02:41:57.865]  As part of meeting the needs of the City of Hardin, where we're coming in and we're going to be a neighbor, Hardin said, we need help with the infrastructure.
[02:41:57.865 --> 02:42:02.048]  APF said, we got some, we want to provide your first vehicle.
[02:42:02.048 --> 02:42:05.011]  We'll bring them in, you can have the vehicle.
[02:42:05.011 --> 02:42:07.813]  Now, this is before I was hired with APF.
[02:42:07.813 --> 02:42:16.779]  The decision was made to buy temporary prototype magnetic placards to go on the doors that would say, um,
[02:42:18.816 --> 02:42:22.679]  That would let the people of Hardin know what their police vehicles could look like.
[02:42:22.679 --> 02:42:29.365]  One of the things that your kind viewers who took those pictures and provided to you of the decals, right?
[02:42:29.365 --> 02:42:30.946]  Steve, you got those pictures?
[02:42:30.946 --> 02:42:31.787]  Alex said he did.
[02:42:31.787 --> 02:42:32.607]  Yes, I did.
[02:42:32.607 --> 02:42:33.528]  Hello?
[02:42:33.528 --> 02:42:43.156]  Okay, the thing that they missed was the sign on the back window that said, not for official use in transport only.
[02:42:44.059 --> 02:42:45.840]  So... Well, forgive me.
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:47.361]  So they didn't get the whole picture.
[02:42:47.361 --> 02:42:50.103]  It's kind of like the 312 thing we talked about.
[02:42:50.103 --> 02:42:53.826]  Let me keep going, because I promised your listeners that I would explain this to them.
[02:42:53.826 --> 02:42:55.367]  Right, but you've had now three minutes.
[02:42:55.367 --> 02:42:57.068]  Let me just respond one minute to that.
[02:42:57.068 --> 02:42:58.189]  No, no, wait a minute.
[02:42:58.189 --> 02:43:00.591]  Alex took the phone for 90 seconds.
[02:43:00.591 --> 02:43:04.374]  Alex came on the line and he talked about bringing armed folks into Montana.
[02:43:04.374 --> 02:43:06.955]  The gentleman... No, no, that was pretty much the state constitution.
[02:43:06.955 --> 02:43:09.537]  I know it's evil, but... No, it's not evil.
[02:43:09.537 --> 02:43:10.238]  I live by it.
[02:43:10.791 --> 02:43:13.572]  No, you can't say that because it is unconstitutional.
[02:43:13.572 --> 02:43:16.953]  You can't say you live by something that's unconstitutional.
[02:43:16.953 --> 02:43:20.014]  Now the thing that is, that I think you need to be aware... No, let me finish.
[02:43:20.014 --> 02:43:21.735]  No, you need to be aware... Let me finish.
[02:43:21.735 --> 02:43:25.616]  No, let me finish because you're saying something that I don't get a chance to respond to.
[02:43:25.616 --> 02:43:25.916]  Okay?
[02:43:25.916 --> 02:43:26.216]  Okay.
[02:43:26.216 --> 02:43:29.137]  Those people carried a Serbian crest on them.
[02:43:29.617 --> 02:43:33.201]  We tracked the ownership of the company that used that.
[02:43:33.201 --> 02:43:35.684]  APF took down their website.
[02:43:35.684 --> 02:43:36.765]  Seriously, you need to know this.
[02:43:36.765 --> 02:43:39.608]  Well, my webmaster and I were on the phone.
[02:43:39.608 --> 02:43:42.271]  It was down, it was up, it was down, it was up.
[02:43:42.271 --> 02:43:45.914]  The thing is, is that one thing led to another, Becky, and I'm just saying this.
[02:43:45.914 --> 02:43:50.159]  It is conceivable that what you know is what you know, what you've been told, and you take it
[02:43:50.539 --> 02:43:52.100]  At face value.
[02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:53.901]  And I understand Hardin's economic plight.
[02:43:53.901 --> 02:43:58.283]  I live in Montana, have for the past 40 years, so I know what's going on, okay?
[02:43:58.283 --> 02:44:08.369]  But the thing that I think that you're losing focus on is that the people are seeing a bigger picture just than Hardin's financial drama.
[02:44:08.369 --> 02:44:09.410]  The idea is this.
[02:44:09.410 --> 02:44:09.750]  Let me finish.
[02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:12.271]  Let me address two topics that you've brought to me.
[02:44:12.271 --> 02:44:13.012]  Number one is
[02:44:17.294 --> 02:44:20.817]  Is the section of our Constitution that Alex read to you.
[02:44:20.817 --> 02:44:28.562]  The context that that was brought up in is how are you going to stop a detention facility and do it within the Constitution?
[02:44:28.562 --> 02:44:32.085]  What we do is we do it legally.
[02:44:32.085 --> 02:44:33.386]  We hire local people.
[02:44:33.386 --> 02:44:37.549]  We train them to the level required by the state of Montana.
[02:44:37.549 --> 02:44:40.351]  And the state of Montana has stringent certification
[02:44:41.711 --> 02:44:42.092]  Correct.
[02:44:42.092 --> 02:44:42.272]  Yes sir.
[02:45:07.096 --> 02:45:08.297]  Okay, good.
[02:45:08.297 --> 02:45:15.083]  Steve, I just want to give her the last word and throw it to you in this segment and the next for the other breaking news you have.
[02:45:15.083 --> 02:45:18.045]  But I want to give Becky, just as we go to break here, about two minutes.
[02:45:18.045 --> 02:45:19.547]  Then you throw it to break in the last two minutes.
[02:45:19.547 --> 02:45:20.467]  Come back with Steve Coyle.
[02:45:20.467 --> 02:45:21.228]  Okay, Steve?
[02:45:21.228 --> 02:45:22.429]  That's fine.
[02:45:22.429 --> 02:45:23.410]  Okay, here's Becky.
[02:45:23.410 --> 02:45:26.473]  Becky, a final comment because we're about to go to break.
[02:45:26.473 --> 02:45:33.699]  Steve, my only comment at this point is that I want to thank you and Alex and all of your listeners for giving me an opportunity to talk today.
[02:45:34.514 --> 02:45:41.079]  As I've said in local media all day, my focus is on the people of Hardin and some of them are gathered around me now.
[02:45:41.079 --> 02:45:48.705]  We're going to be outside now because I'm going to finish the tour of the property here, so I'm going to say goodbye to you and your viewers, or your listeners.
[02:45:48.705 --> 02:45:49.926]  Thank you very much, Abby.
[02:45:49.926 --> 02:45:55.610]  Steve, you and I had a little plan to meet and have me be on your show.
[02:45:55.610 --> 02:46:01.255]  You kind of got a little bit usurped by Alex there, so let's you and I do another show together, okay?
[02:46:02.023 --> 02:46:03.824]  Sure, but again, I want to make it clear.
[02:46:03.824 --> 02:46:11.250]  Steve, I want to get your comment and then I'm going to get off the phone and let you come back in the next segment.
[02:46:11.250 --> 02:46:14.212]  I just want to point out that all these people running this are foreigners.
[02:46:14.212 --> 02:46:18.535]  They have to hire a local to be their front person because they're all foreigners.
[02:46:18.535 --> 02:46:25.340]  Right, and Alex, the main issue is that the hardened city limits versus the reservation.
[02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:27.101]  There are different laws that apply.
[02:46:27.101 --> 02:46:28.242]  This is on the reservation.
[02:46:28.422 --> 02:46:29.403]  This is on the reservation.
[02:46:29.403 --> 02:46:33.365]  Hardness, for those that don't know, is on the line of the state and the Crow.
[02:46:33.365 --> 02:46:34.726]  That's what it says on my road map.
[02:46:34.726 --> 02:46:35.727]  They gave me at their car rental.
[02:46:35.727 --> 02:46:37.468]  Is that correct?
[02:46:37.468 --> 02:46:39.529]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[02:46:39.529 --> 02:46:45.313]  And for those that will talk when we come back after the break, all you have to see is the parallel to the cabazon.
[02:46:50.094 --> 02:46:51.115]  I don't know about it.
[02:46:51.115 --> 02:47:01.283]  What that means is you can get away with, oh let's use the word, you can get away with everything you want that's unconstitutional when you're doing it in a territory versus the United States.
[02:47:01.283 --> 02:47:06.007]  So there are legal questions and I believe that's what the real crux of the matter is.
[02:47:06.007 --> 02:47:08.089]  You can do things in a reservation.
[02:47:08.089 --> 02:47:14.014]  We have the Cabazon Indian Reservation in California, Inslaw Promise Software, CIA, and that's where it all goes, Alex.
[02:47:15.834 --> 02:47:17.495]  I think we just dropped Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.495 --> 02:47:19.215]  We have Steve Quayle with us.
[02:47:19.215 --> 02:47:22.376]  Alex Jones on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[02:47:22.376 --> 02:47:24.057]  This is just simply unbelievable.
[02:47:24.057 --> 02:47:30.819]  She's pretty much confirming that this is a foreign-run merc service called American Police Force.
[02:47:30.819 --> 02:47:32.080]  How ironic.
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:33.620]  It is hardly American.
[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:40.863]  It is hardly what the Founding Fathers stood for, to bring in foreign mercenaries to police the American populace, Steve.
[02:47:41.465 --> 02:47:57.336]  Well, absolutely, Jason, and I'm looking at the aliases of one man that supposedly is the head of the APF, and we've got at least half a dozen—no, I'm sorry, one, two, I'll count them off the screen, I'll send this to you—probably eight or nine Middle Eastern aliases.
[02:47:57.336 --> 02:48:01.379]  You guys track the Pakistani tie, I track the Kuwaiti tie.
[02:48:01.379 --> 02:48:04.381]  You know, the bottom line is that we're really, really
[02:48:04.861 --> 02:48:06.603]  Can I tell you something?
[02:48:06.603 --> 02:48:07.925]  We're dealing with the surface.
[02:48:07.925 --> 02:48:09.607]  I understand the hardened people.
[02:48:09.607 --> 02:48:10.348]  They want jobs.
[02:48:10.348 --> 02:48:11.850]  That place has been so depressed.
[02:48:11.850 --> 02:48:12.932]  That's not the issue.
[02:48:12.932 --> 02:48:20.502]  The issue is, is there major foreign entities that are going to be training mercs used against us?
[02:48:20.942 --> 02:48:24.143]  And it's the ideal place to take people under whatever.
[02:48:24.143 --> 02:48:27.784]  Now look, I stand by my, the person that sent me the information.
[02:48:27.784 --> 02:48:34.546]  They were told by a city council member that the whole situation was the forced vaccinations, the gun issue, etc.
[02:48:34.546 --> 02:48:36.907]  And when we come back, I want to address those with Alex.
[02:48:37.705 --> 02:48:38.286]  Absolutely.
[02:48:38.286 --> 02:48:40.007]  We're going to have you on for one more segment.
[02:48:40.007 --> 02:48:41.288]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:41.288 --> 02:48:42.689]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[02:48:42.689 --> 02:48:48.293]  Just an amazing amount of intel coming in from Hardin, Montana.
[02:48:48.293 --> 02:48:50.715]  Again, USA Today picking up on the story.
[02:48:50.715 --> 02:48:53.717]  The Boston Herald picking up on the story.
[02:48:53.717 --> 02:48:59.001]  It's just unbelievable to me that we now live in a country where they can hire a multiple
[02:48:59.461 --> 02:49:27.477]  Felon a multiple felon with civil suits pending against him of over a million dollars in losses somebody who has been a con man acting as though he is a car salesman an arts dealer a foreign military man someone who advised on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and this is the guy that's going to head this up and like you said they're going to use tribal lands to train foreign mercenaries and militaries this this was foreshadowed this summer by
[02:49:27.697 --> 02:49:44.527]  With National Level Exercise 09 where they went into FEMA Region 6, which included Montana by the way, and they took over national, regional, local, and tribal governments prepping them for this situation and now we have it coming to fruition in front of our eyes, Steve.
[02:49:45.356 --> 02:49:48.077]  Well, and that you've laid it out absolutely perfectly.
[02:49:48.077 --> 02:49:51.239]  The thing is, though, the timetable has now been moved up.
[02:49:51.239 --> 02:49:53.821]  And that's the thing, Jason, that I'm really concerned with.
[02:49:53.821 --> 02:49:58.003]  Because, well, Alex is on the ground in Hardin, Montana, having flown into Billings.
[02:49:58.003 --> 02:49:59.784]  All the people he's meeting there.
[02:49:59.784 --> 02:50:02.225]  I mean, I'll tell you one thing that Montanans are.
[02:50:02.225 --> 02:50:05.827]  Montanans just, they say it like they see it, and they call it like it is.
[02:50:06.247 --> 02:50:06.907]  Okay?
[02:50:06.907 --> 02:50:08.168]  We're too rural.
[02:50:08.168 --> 02:50:10.449]  Where Alex is is incredibly rural.
[02:50:10.449 --> 02:50:14.271]  The area around the Prior Mountains is incredibly rural.
[02:50:14.271 --> 02:50:22.274]  So when you've got hard-working Montanans, eyewitnesses, talking to Alex and sending me emails while we're on the air together, I've got to tell you something.
[02:50:22.274 --> 02:50:23.815]  This isn't Bravo Sierra.
[02:50:23.815 --> 02:50:26.916]  This is real-time warning.
[02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.417]  And here's the thing that people don't understand.
[02:50:28.917 --> 02:50:32.342]  This is how they're working across the country today.
[02:50:32.342 --> 02:50:40.835]  The powers that be that are going to put us under martial law are buying off, bribing, and giving bonuses, if you will, to people that tell on people.
[02:50:40.835 --> 02:50:43.659]  I mean, this is just so out of control, and I might
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:52.324]  And Steve, they are targeting economically destitute areas where people are willing to go along to get along.
[02:50:52.324 --> 02:50:53.945]  Next segment coming up with Steve Quayle.
[02:50:53.945 --> 02:50:54.945]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:54.945 --> 02:50:58.668]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in the latest over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:02.921 --> 02:51:04.922]  Remain in your houses.
[02:51:04.922 --> 02:51:10.684]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:51:10.684 --> 02:51:12.045]  Will they do it?
[02:51:12.045 --> 02:51:14.666]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:51:14.666 --> 02:51:20.608]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:51:21.129 --> 02:51:23.311]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:51:23.311 --> 02:51:27.596]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[02:51:27.596 --> 02:51:32.481]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:51:32.481 --> 02:51:37.406]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:51:37.406 --> 02:51:42.231]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:51:43.132 --> 02:51:51.555]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:51:51.555 --> 02:51:54.056]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[02:51:57.118 --> 02:52:00.039]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:03.262]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.262 --> 02:52:06.886]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:06.886 --> 02:52:09.369]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.369 --> 02:52:12.432]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:12.432 --> 02:52:17.838]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:52:18.198 --> 02:52:22.121]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:52:47.978 --> 02:52:49.059]  Yes, yes I'm ready.
[02:53:01.789 --> 02:53:12.372]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:53:12.372 --> 02:53:13.792]  Garden in a Can!
[02:53:13.792 --> 02:53:17.934]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[02:53:17.934 --> 02:53:19.954]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[02:53:19.954 --> 02:53:22.235]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[02:53:22.715 --> 02:53:31.706]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[02:53:32.381 --> 02:53:33.802]  Garden in a Can.
[02:53:33.802 --> 02:53:35.003]  It's that simple.
[02:53:35.003 --> 02:53:37.405]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[02:53:37.405 --> 02:53:41.748]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:53:41.748 --> 02:53:43.329]  Ready when you are.
[02:53:43.329 --> 02:53:46.951]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.

[02:53:53.416 --> 02:53:53.456]  866-598-7396.
[02:54:08.464 --> 02:54:09.104]  We are back.
[02:54:09.104 --> 02:54:10.165]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:10.165 --> 02:54:20.809]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana, getting the tour from Becky Shea, the front person, the spokeswoman for all of this, only divulging so much.
[02:54:20.809 --> 02:54:24.891]  Very nice, well-meaning lady, but we've got a ton of well-meaning idiots out there.
[02:54:25.231 --> 02:54:27.713]  That are allowing this progression to occur.
[02:54:27.713 --> 02:54:35.960]  I really hope that she decides it's not enough to just go along to get along and she realizes that this is a violation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:41.004]  This is against everything that Americans who believe in those documents stand for.
[02:54:41.004 --> 02:54:48.230]  Steve, can you just give us a quick overview of how this has developed over the last week and then the FBI ties you just discussed with me off-air?
[02:54:48.766 --> 02:55:05.812]  Well, I think the thing that people need to understand real quickly is this has been developing, especially in Hart, Montana, over the last, probably, year, primarily, and economically destitute areas, not just in Montana, but in other states, that can be used for training of foreign mercenaries, and let's call them what they are, Jason.
[02:55:06.472 --> 02:55:08.074]  Who are these mercenaries going to be used against?
[02:55:21.189 --> 02:55:47.883]  The idea simply is to pre-position the troops that all of us have been warning about for years, and not only the ones that are currently pre-positioned throughout the country, but when the Declaration of Martial Law is declared either by a weapon of mass destruction over Washington, D.C., New York, London, wherever it proceeds from, or it's the biological plague generated in the laboratory, in which, by the way, Jason, two more bio-agents of world renown have just been murdered in the last two weeks.
[02:55:47.883 --> 02:55:48.764]  Murdered.
[02:55:48.764 --> 02:55:50.465]  The idea is this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:50.905 --> 02:56:01.332]  That we're talking about a reservation town, Ardmontown, that's been hit by incredibly, incredibly bad economics.
[02:56:01.332 --> 02:56:02.533]  We have a good idea.
[02:56:02.533 --> 02:56:05.115]  There was a $27 million prison built there.
[02:56:05.115 --> 02:56:08.017]  Basically, it did not meet state specifications.
[02:56:08.017 --> 02:56:17.103]  Our governor and I think one or two of our senators were sued to be able to allow the private utilization of that
[02:56:17.803 --> 02:56:18.304]  Uh, prison.
[02:56:18.304 --> 02:56:33.196]  Now, isn't it interesting that the only prison that could be utilized, at least the only available prison, is in Hardin, Montana, which happens to be on a reservation which fits the same category as Guantanamo Bay, which basically Alex brought up.
[02:56:33.885 --> 02:56:34.665]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:56:53.391 --> 02:57:08.778]  With who knows what's going on up there, and that's in Great Falls, and then we've got the reports of 7,000 mercenaries of Blackwater being hired to secure the Montana border against people fleeing the United States into Canada when it all comes down.
[02:57:09.398 --> 02:57:15.801]  So we've got all of this being focused right now on Hardin, Montana, and as Alex said, hey, you just said it too.
[02:57:15.801 --> 02:57:31.910]  We've got a felon who seems to be the front man, but when we go beyond the front men, when we go beyond the front women, and we get to the heart of the matter, we've got the potential to have a very, very major strategic placement
[02:57:32.290 --> 02:57:37.694]  Of foreign troops, mercenaries, and quite candidly, the money that it brings in is nothing.
[02:57:37.694 --> 02:57:42.498]  That's the only way I can get a chance to ask Becky, is where does all this money come from?
[02:57:42.498 --> 02:57:46.941]  Because what we're looking at is basically very sophisticated funds.
[02:57:46.941 --> 02:57:56.829]  We're looking at a model where you basically come in and buy the population, economically distressed areas, and they're doing the same thing, by the way, in major cities across the United States, in giant warehouses.
[02:57:56.829 --> 02:57:59.231]  So, we're at the point now where
[02:57:59.672 --> 02:58:03.125]  Where the time table has been ramped and amped up.
[02:58:03.125 --> 02:58:04.088]  How much time do we have?
[02:58:04.502 --> 02:58:07.704]  We got about 60 seconds in this segment.
[02:58:07.704 --> 02:58:11.807]  On the other side, Steve, I want you to discuss how far this goes.
[02:58:11.807 --> 02:58:13.628]  I mean, is this a federal program?
[02:58:13.628 --> 02:58:19.212]  We've heard Obama say we need a police force that's just as strong, just as well-funded as the military.
[02:58:19.212 --> 02:58:22.714]  We've seen the Youth Corps being rolled out through City Year.
[02:58:22.714 --> 02:58:26.937]  We've seen the economy becoming crushed as they announce a carbon tax.
[02:58:26.937 --> 02:58:32.021]  We've seen them say, no, there aren't mandatory vaccinations, but the military has mandatory vaccinations.
[02:58:32.021 --> 02:58:33.902]  And oh, there's mandatory vaccination at the school, too.
[02:58:34.282 --> 02:58:35.923]  We are losing this country.
[02:58:35.923 --> 02:58:43.428]  Back after this, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:43.428 --> 02:58:46.830]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.830 --> 02:58:48.892]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.851 --> 02:58:54.233]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.233 --> 02:58:57.856]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.856 --> 02:59:02.419]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.419 --> 02:59:08.023]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.303 --> 02:59:13.086]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.086 --> 02:59:16.708]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.708 --> 02:59:21.510]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:28.074]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.074 --> 02:59:30.035]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.515 --> 02:59:33.717]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:59:41.001 --> 02:59:41.621]  Call today.
[02:59:41.621 --> 02:59:43.062]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.062 --> 02:59:44.983]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:11.883 --> 03:00:12.904]  We are back live.
[03:00:12.904 --> 03:00:14.205]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.205 --> 03:00:21.209]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in as Alex is on the ground at Hardin, Montana, getting a tour of this Two Rivers facility.
[03:00:21.209 --> 03:00:25.872]  USA Today, the Boston Herald, the Associated Press have all picked up on this story.
[03:00:25.872 --> 03:00:35.158]  This is being run, not by my words, but by the Billing Gazette and others, by a hardened criminal, a multiple felon, somebody who uses multiple aliases.
[03:00:35.158 --> 03:00:39.381]  This screams of a globalist operation, but I'm going to give it to Steve Quayle,
[03:00:39.921 --> 03:00:43.424]  To break down how far down the rabbit hole this actually goes.
[03:00:43.424 --> 03:00:44.425]  Steve?
[03:00:44.425 --> 03:00:53.592]  Well, it's interesting because you've done such a wonderful job, Jason, of telling people about, look, we've heard the words from the presidential administration that they want a private police force.
[03:00:53.592 --> 03:01:07.684]  We're now seeing everything that we saw in pre-, and I say this, in the time between the breakdown of the German economy, the Weimar Republic, and the rise of a National Socialist known as the Nazis, we're seeing such a
[03:01:07.844 --> 03:01:15.572]  A parallel, and we're also seeing the introduction of foreign troops into this country on unimagined levels.
[03:01:15.572 --> 03:01:20.697]  Everybody, Jason, as you know, you guys have been reporting on it on your radio show and on your website.
[03:01:20.697 --> 03:01:24.000]  I mean, the amount of military transportation.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.623]  There are people that are high-ranking military officials.
[03:01:26.623 --> 03:01:30.547]  I mean, they've never seen such a thing like this, even in the build-up to the first Gulf War.
[03:01:31.187 --> 03:01:33.207]  Nothing like this has ever occurred.
[03:01:33.207 --> 03:01:37.708]  The idea that the black helicopters... How about the situation in Tennessee?
[03:01:37.708 --> 03:01:42.489]  Where the 101st Airborne, I believe, is, you know, dropping in on a little town.
[03:01:42.489 --> 03:01:46.170]  And did you see the operational plan for that?
[03:01:46.170 --> 03:01:48.770]  They're seeking one individual.
[03:01:48.770 --> 03:01:56.012]  Come on, you don't drop in 340 paratroopers or whatever the final count is to go after one guy, or do you?
[03:01:56.012 --> 03:01:57.432]  Let me tell you what I'm being told.
[03:01:57.432 --> 03:01:58.292]  I'm being told now
[03:01:58.772 --> 03:02:09.562]  That the FBI director has gone to major cities and been telling them to prepare the special agents in charge, or the FACs, are being told, get ready, get ready, get ready.
[03:02:09.562 --> 03:02:14.386]  So I don't know the timetable, but they seem to know the timetable.
[03:02:14.386 --> 03:02:18.090]  I have been told from deep pool, from people deep on the inside
[03:02:18.690 --> 03:02:30.613]  That the fact is that bounties are being given for military to inform on other high-ranking military members that won't go along with the anti-constitutional basically grab for the government.
[03:02:30.613 --> 03:02:42.957]  I'm being told that even in police departments, Jason, that now a lot of the law enforcement officers that listen to Alex, listen to myself, listen to others at a warning, are starting to notice the presence
[03:02:43.377 --> 03:02:53.943]  Of high-ranking, and in many cases, people that outrank them, foreigners put in, inserted into their law enforcement departments to seemingly be observers.
[03:02:53.943 --> 03:03:11.674]  We're being told that a $500,000 bounty is being offered for, again, about a half a million bucks, ladies and gentlemen, for people to inform on, military people to inform on each other, high-ranking police to segregate out and designate out what they're calling resistors.
[03:03:12.154 --> 03:03:17.104]  I've been told by people that were recently at Fort Bliss as late or as early as that.
[03:03:17.950 --> 03:03:39.868]  Monday of this week, that when the military is getting ready to deploy to Iraq, they'll have a federal official walk in, this will really happen, and make the statement, I hope there are no Tea Party members here, and one brave American soldier stood up and said, Sir, I am, and I will defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and all the men applauded and stood with that man.
[03:03:39.868 --> 03:03:42.050]  That's at Fort Bliss at the beginning of the week.
[03:03:42.050 --> 03:03:43.531]  So what's happening is this.
[03:03:44.011 --> 03:03:51.060]  It's obvious, it's right in front of our face, and the idea of the orchestrated meltdown of the economy, all this is linked.
[03:03:51.060 --> 03:04:00.872]  The genetically altered viruses, H1N1, H5N1, all of this stuff, the Ebola smallpox, the Spanish flu, the dead scientists, it's all coming in.
[03:04:00.872 --> 03:04:02.234]  This is not a conspiracy!
[03:04:02.594 --> 03:04:04.274]  This is happening now!
[03:04:04.274 --> 03:04:12.897]  And so the point is, is that as Alex is saying, and he's in Hart, Montana, and ladies and gentlemen, again, I tell you, pray for his safety.
[03:04:12.897 --> 03:04:14.577]  Pray for his safety.
[03:04:14.577 --> 03:04:19.318]  The idea is that the mainstream is finally getting a clue.
[03:04:19.318 --> 03:04:29.061]  And by the way, for those of you that are big-time web bot fans, you know, predictive linguistic software, this is a fulfillment of that which is coming to pass.
[03:04:29.421 --> 03:04:30.321]  I don't know.
[03:04:51.229 --> 03:04:52.649]  That everybody's got to understand.
[03:04:52.649 --> 03:04:57.910]  It's the acclamation of the American public to the police state, the military like never before.
[03:04:57.910 --> 03:05:01.591]  Back after this with Steve Quayle, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:01.591 --> 03:05:04.592]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.592 --> 03:05:09.933]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.933 --> 03:05:11.973]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:11.973 --> 03:05:16.974]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.974 --> 03:05:17.894]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.154 --> 03:05:19.275]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.275 --> 03:05:21.156]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.156 --> 03:05:22.237]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.237 --> 03:05:24.438]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.438 --> 03:05:25.779]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.779 --> 03:05:27.300]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:32.564]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.564 --> 03:05:36.166]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.166 --> 03:05:39.629]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.969 --> 03:05:41.190]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:42.111]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.111 --> 03:05:43.213]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.213 --> 03:05:44.134]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.134 --> 03:05:45.235]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.235 --> 03:05:48.278]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:50.981]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.734 --> 03:06:06.041]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.041 --> 03:06:10.567]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.567 --> 03:06:12.850]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.850 --> 03:06:14.472]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.472 --> 03:06:15.514]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.734 --> 03:06:24.159]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:08:05.054 --> 03:08:09.096]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.096 --> 03:08:10.217]  We are back live.
[03:08:10.217 --> 03:08:11.297]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:11.297 --> 03:08:13.378]  Alex to pop in at the bottom of this hour.
[03:08:13.378 --> 03:08:17.880]  If you've missed any of this power-packed program, you're going to want to get the podcast.
[03:08:17.880 --> 03:08:24.763]  We are exposing foreign mercenaries in the United States training at a FEMA facility
[03:08:26.107 --> 03:08:28.029]  In Hardin, Montana.
[03:08:28.029 --> 03:08:29.330]  Simply incredible.
[03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:34.595]  The American public are being acclimated like never before to military on the streets.
[03:08:34.595 --> 03:08:36.396]  And I want to make this point, Steve.
[03:08:36.396 --> 03:08:37.437]  You know, U.S.
[03:08:37.437 --> 03:08:41.321]  military are going to have a hard time firing on U.S.
[03:08:41.321 --> 03:08:41.681]  citizens.
[03:08:41.681 --> 03:08:43.303]  A lot of people are going to have a problem with that.
[03:08:43.303 --> 03:08:46.726]  But when you bring in foreign military troops and they're under foreign command,
[03:08:47.086 --> 03:08:57.402]  They are much more likely to put a bullet in the back of your head to make a point, and that is what is so dangerous, not only having the military on the streets, but foreign mercenaries as well.
[03:08:58.069 --> 03:09:00.510]  Well, and you bring up the most important point, Jason.
[03:09:00.510 --> 03:09:11.054]  Those targets that have already been assigned, as Alex was targeted in the piece with 25 other people that are on Obama's hit list, listen, these people are already assigned.
[03:09:11.054 --> 03:09:13.495]  The GPSing was the giveaway.
[03:09:13.495 --> 03:09:20.338]  And I've been told by the military that the GPSing was done so that they have, they have, listen, we have weapon systems that people don't even know about.
[03:09:20.698 --> 03:09:32.386]  But when a button's pressed and you've got a bunch of smart bomblets or rocketlets or a Hellfire missile going through your front door, you really don't have time to basically break out whatever you might use to defend yourself.
[03:09:32.386 --> 03:09:39.991]  The thing that people have got to understand is NORTHCOM even requested legal authority to deploy 400,000 troops.
[03:09:39.991 --> 03:09:42.152]  Remember that about, what, three or four weeks ago?
[03:09:42.152 --> 03:09:42.753]  Absolutely.
[03:09:42.753 --> 03:09:44.153]  You guys have it on your website, too.
[03:09:44.153 --> 03:09:44.734]  Yes, yes.
[03:09:45.094 --> 03:09:54.705]  Okay, now how do you deploy 400,000 troops when you can't get 40,000 additional troops to Afghanistan and basically supply the needs over there?
[03:09:54.705 --> 03:09:59.611]  The idea is that the, I've been told, and I've gone on record, I'm telling you this,
[03:10:00.111 --> 03:10:20.468]  And for those of you in the world of military and intelligence, you know this is true, that we have now close to 400,000 foreign troops at different military bases under different, quote, training programs, and they're here to basically follow the United Nations orders and the United Nations, who just got appointed, Jason, the head of the Security Council.
[03:10:20.991 --> 03:10:23.715]  Let's not forget the first sitting president in U.S.
[03:10:23.715 --> 03:10:28.721]  history to accept the job, Barack Obama, sealing the U.N.-U.S.
[03:10:28.721 --> 03:10:32.146]  globalist takeover in this country and around the world, Steve.
[03:10:32.708 --> 03:10:43.273]  Absolutely, and for the first time in the history of the United States, the official prayer breakfast of the United States, quote, under Christians, no longer acceptable.
[03:10:43.273 --> 03:10:55.618]  Christian imagery, Christian talk, hey, even now Christmas trees can't be called Christmas trees, and I think it's the, what, National Park Service or somebody just announced today that there'll be no quote-unquote Christmas ornaments because it's too secular.
[03:10:55.618 --> 03:11:01.040]  Get this, ladies and gentlemen, you can't talk about Jesus, but everything else goes, and I gotta share this with you.
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:02.141]  This is telling, look,
[03:11:02.621 --> 03:11:05.645]  The tree is known by the fruit it bears.
[03:11:05.645 --> 03:11:15.238]  And when every single thing is opposed to what this country was founded on and what was the presidential campaign, this is the greatest country in the world and we intend to change that.
[03:11:15.238 --> 03:11:16.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, wake up!
[03:11:16.900 --> 03:11:18.322]  You're being mind-controlled!
[03:11:18.322 --> 03:11:19.484]  You're being dumbed down!
[03:11:20.064 --> 03:11:25.946]  And that's why everyone is going to be, you know, facing massive unemployment, massive riots.
[03:11:25.946 --> 03:11:30.408]  That's why all the preposition weapons to the different gangs and the different ethnic groups.
[03:11:30.408 --> 03:11:32.769]  By the way, Jesus said nation will rise against nation.
[03:11:32.769 --> 03:11:34.649]  That word is ethnics.
[03:11:34.649 --> 03:11:37.570]  It means different people groups are going to go at war.
[03:11:37.570 --> 03:11:39.131]  This is all stir in the pot.
[03:11:39.671 --> 03:11:50.474]  And this is what's going on, and the idea is, listen, as a Montana citizen, okay, I don't give, uh, I better say this right, I don't care what the official mouthpieces for anything say.
[03:11:50.474 --> 03:12:05.098]  The fact that the guys that are going to kill me and my fellow statesmen who happen to believe in states' rights over the constitutional authority, or, forgive me, the unconstitutional authority of the state, or of the federal government over state government, we're saying, hey,
[03:12:05.618 --> 03:12:06.339]  Guess what?
[03:12:06.339 --> 03:12:07.619]  We live in Montana.
[03:12:07.619 --> 03:12:08.860]  We know what's going on.
[03:12:08.860 --> 03:12:13.843]  We're the ones running into the Tazi troops on BMW motorcycles.
[03:12:13.843 --> 03:12:20.526]  We're the ones seeing and getting the reports from the 7,000 people that have been brought in to secure the border.
[03:12:20.526 --> 03:12:23.588]  Now, again, Jason, that's a huge story.
[03:12:23.588 --> 03:12:28.571]  Even as we speak, jets come in from the leading mercenary organization of the world,
[03:12:28.991 --> 03:12:37.056]  And they take foreign troops up and train them in the area that they're going to secure, and then they take them back to whatever military bases that they're bivouacked at.
[03:12:37.056 --> 03:12:46.122]  And at some point, and it appears that point is near, I do not know the day or hour, but I can tell you this, with everything that's going on, we're getting closer and closer and closer.
[03:12:46.122 --> 03:12:51.746]  You sense it, Alex senses it, and now we've gone from the word sense to absolutely seeing it.
[03:12:52.086 --> 03:12:52.486]  We're good.
[03:13:15.879 --> 03:13:16.860]  Service Inc?
[03:13:16.860 --> 03:13:18.942]  That's another possible corporate entity?
[03:13:18.942 --> 03:13:23.086]  One guy that poo-pooed me yesterday, Jason, just found out that, hey, guess what?
[03:13:23.086 --> 03:13:29.412]  The address that they're registered to is a medical marijuana depository.
[03:13:29.412 --> 03:13:32.496]  Does that maybe tell you that maybe everything's not on the up-and-up?
[03:13:32.496 --> 03:13:34.317]  Or basically, how about this?
[03:13:34.317 --> 03:13:36.980]  One toke over the line, sweet New World Order.
[03:13:36.980 --> 03:13:39.803]  You know, the bottom line is that nothing stacks up.
[03:13:40.343 --> 03:13:53.312]  If you and I were basic rookie cops or rookie detectives, when we follow all the leads of all the evidence and we get rid of all the fake and all we're left with is the root, that's what we're following.
[03:13:53.312 --> 03:13:59.416]  And when you follow the money, you come to the same conclusion that Alex, you, and I, and others have warned about.
[03:13:59.816 --> 03:14:10.583]  This is absolutely the systematic, uh, preparatory phase for the implementation of martial law using foreign mercenary troops who will kill their pre-assigned targets.
[03:14:10.583 --> 03:14:16.367]  And ladies and gentlemen, if the public knows that Obama has a hit list, George Bush and Cheney had their hit list,
[03:14:16.727 --> 03:14:20.611]  Clinton had his hit list, now they're bringing Clinton in to help Obama with his hit list.
[03:14:20.611 --> 03:14:27.438]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's way beyond, quote, a vast right-wing conspiracy or even a left-wing conspiracy.
[03:14:27.438 --> 03:14:34.905]  This is Luciferian, it's evil, and if we don't stop, we won't be able to stop it, Jason, but we can help people.
[03:14:35.285 --> 03:14:38.046]  By the grace of God, to save as many lives as possible.
[03:14:38.046 --> 03:14:42.327]  The best defense is number one, acknowledging that this stuff does not add up.
[03:14:42.327 --> 03:14:43.608]  I tell people to pray about it.
[03:14:43.608 --> 03:14:45.308]  I tell people to do their own homework.
[03:14:45.308 --> 03:14:57.872]  But they can't deny that all roads lead to a very wealthy and powerful group of individuals that are systematically going to balkanize the United States.
[03:15:00.233 --> 03:15:21.541]  And you know, Bill Clinton plays into this left-right paradigm on purpose, knowing he works for the globalists, knowing he wants a position at the UN with him and his wife, and his wife just mused how it was great to be president of the UN for a couple of days.
[03:15:21.721 --> 03:15:22.061]  No, we're good.
[03:15:36.810 --> 03:15:37.911]  Left and right.
[03:15:37.911 --> 03:15:39.492]  Conservative and liberal.
[03:15:39.492 --> 03:15:41.113]  This is about humanity.
[03:15:41.113 --> 03:15:43.775]  This is about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[03:15:43.775 --> 03:15:50.019]  This is about fighting an upcoming police state that we see ever encroaching right in front of our faces.
[03:15:50.019 --> 03:15:53.822]  And now with this in Montana, it has never been this bad, Steve.
[03:15:54.338 --> 03:15:58.880]  It has not, and this is like Alex, and God bless him and he keyed in on it.
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:05.142]  This is, if you will, this is the igniter key that people have got to recognize.
[03:16:05.142 --> 03:16:07.363]  They can say, well I just heard that as internet rumor.
[03:16:07.363 --> 03:16:08.424]  I just heard it as this or that.
[03:16:08.424 --> 03:16:10.805]  Listen, I never got the answer to my question.
[03:16:10.805 --> 03:16:13.366]  Why was no protest made over police decals?
[03:16:13.926 --> 03:16:15.949]  Becky said not for official purposes.
[03:16:15.949 --> 03:16:17.131]  I can tell you this.
[03:16:17.131 --> 03:16:20.756]  I have enough photos to prove that that is not true.
[03:16:20.756 --> 03:16:22.558]  But it was never put on their cars.
[03:16:22.558 --> 03:16:24.741]  And again, why did no one question?
[03:16:24.741 --> 03:16:25.762]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[03:16:25.762 --> 03:16:31.310]  Because people that were in a position of authority were hired by APF.
[03:16:31.710 --> 03:16:31.870]  I think.
[03:16:47.171 --> 03:16:50.393]  As blatantly in our face as it can be.
[03:16:50.393 --> 03:16:57.238]  And those of you who think, well, this doesn't bother me because it's in Hardin, Montana, you don't know what's going on in your own city in some closed-out warehouse.
[03:16:57.238 --> 03:17:02.963]  And when the go signal is given, they plan to come down on a full-fledged hammer.
[03:17:02.963 --> 03:17:14.111]  And I want to say, and I don't know how much longer I have, but in closing, those of you in law enforcement, even in Hardin, Montana, whether you're tribal, whether you're community, whether you're county,
[03:17:14.631 --> 03:17:37.607]  Those of you who are being bought off at this point, you will be blown off at a later date, because with all of the foreign observers slash military personnel being placed in the police departments throughout the country, their number one duty is to make sure that the underlings follow the orders, and then once their orders are fulfilled, they are the ones that will opt
[03:17:37.987 --> 03:17:38.568]  We're good to go.
[03:17:53.263 --> 03:18:00.530]  History now is irrelevant because the only thing that matters to the American public is their daily dose of mindless entertainment.
[03:18:00.530 --> 03:18:11.520]  And they don't recognize, and I've said this, that when the parachuters are coming out of the sky and the roads are blocked off, this isn't the time to go up and say, gee, is this a movie and can I get a few bucks for being an extra?
[03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:14.403]  That's the concept that we're fighting in America.
[03:18:14.403 --> 03:18:18.827]  We are fighting a mind-controlled, media-manipulated,
[03:18:19.247 --> 03:18:34.311]  A group of individuals that basically cannot see and will maybe not see until it's too late, and that's why we strive, we do everything we can to inform, inform, inform, because the best antidote for fear is the truth, and that's what we're about.
[03:18:34.813 --> 03:18:45.076]  And if you don't think we can succumb to mind control, folks, you know, you just mentioned Red China and Mao and the unbelievable atrocities and genocide that occurred there.
[03:18:45.076 --> 03:18:49.277]  But just today, China communists marked 60 years in power with parade.
[03:18:49.277 --> 03:18:54.518]  Over 80,000 children in Tiananmen Square spelled out Chinese character for national celebration.
[03:18:54.818 --> 03:18:55.579]  We're good to go.
[03:19:10.935 --> 03:19:13.957]  It's unbelievable, but it is occurring, it's happening.
[03:19:13.957 --> 03:19:25.384]  I mean, I interviewed, you know, these Falun Gong protesters at the G20, and although they could report on all these horrors, I asked them if they thought they lived in a police state, Steve, and they said no.
[03:19:25.384 --> 03:19:35.371]  They just, they can't get past the fact that they live under a communist, oppressive regime, and we're moving closer and closer to that regime as we speak.
[03:19:35.371 --> 03:19:37.192]  Any final thoughts, Steve, in the last 20 seconds?
[03:19:37.512 --> 03:19:45.974]  Well, last 20 seconds, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, if you will do your homework and follow the leads that are posted on Infowars.com, go and read the Billings Gazette article.
[03:19:45.974 --> 03:19:54.716]  It's the news alert of my day on my website, BeQuail.com, and then listen to Alex's compilation, because he's there, boots on the ground, and God bless you, Jason.
[03:19:54.716 --> 03:19:58.877]  Thanks for what you did at the G20, and ladies and gentlemen, pray for Alex and everyone.
[03:19:58.877 --> 03:19:59.317]  Thank you.
[03:19:59.317 --> 03:20:00.278]  We'll be back after this.
[03:20:00.278 --> 03:20:01.218]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:02.025 --> 03:20:07.187]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[03:20:07.187 --> 03:20:10.688]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:20:10.688 --> 03:20:16.410]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:20:16.410 --> 03:20:18.971]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:20:18.971 --> 03:20:23.512]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:20:23.512 --> 03:20:26.233]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:20:26.693 --> 03:20:32.420]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:20:32.420 --> 03:20:34.683]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:20:34.683 --> 03:20:43.233]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:20:43.233 --> 03:20:44.234]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:20:44.594 --> 03:20:49.176]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:20:49.176 --> 03:20:54.299]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:20:54.299 --> 03:20:56.040]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:20:56.040 --> 03:20:58.261]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:20:58.261 --> 03:20:59.982]  Be well and stay well.
[03:20:59.982 --> 03:21:01.762]  Best, MZ.
[03:21:01.762 --> 03:21:07.485]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:21:07.485 --> 03:21:08.826]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:08.826 --> 03:21:10.807]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:10.807 --> 03:21:12.448]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[03:21:13.669 --> 03:21:17.830]  It finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:26.731]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:26.731 --> 03:21:33.832]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:33.832 --> 03:21:36.993]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:36.993 --> 03:21:42.074]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:21:42.754 --> 03:21:45.836]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:21:45.836 --> 03:21:51.879]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:21:51.879 --> 03:21:54.820]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:21:54.820 --> 03:21:59.763]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:22:02.967 --> 03:22:04.428]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:04.428 --> 03:22:10.473]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:22:10.473 --> 03:22:11.293]  That's right.
[03:22:11.293 --> 03:22:14.976]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:22:14.976 --> 03:22:21.061]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:22:21.621 --> 03:22:29.743]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:29.743 --> 03:22:35.245]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:22:35.245 --> 03:22:41.046]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:41.046 --> 03:22:45.567]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:22:45.567 --> 03:22:45.807]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.408 --> 03:22:50.889]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:22:50.889 --> 03:22:51.249]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.249 --> 03:22:51.589]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.589 --> 03:22:55.231]  When you hear the words water purification what comes to mind?
[03:23:04.631 --> 03:23:08.534]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:23:08.534 --> 03:23:12.257]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:23:12.257 --> 03:23:19.542]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[03:23:22.432 --> 03:23:22.992]  We're good to go.
[03:23:50.993 --> 03:23:53.736]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:23:53.736 --> 03:23:54.397]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[03:24:13.052 --> 03:24:13.732]  We are back.
[03:24:13.732 --> 03:24:14.653]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.653 --> 03:24:34.300]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in as Alex Jones has boots on the ground in Hardin, Montana at the FEMA camp at the privatized military mercenary training center that doesn't exist according to the majority of the mainstream media and talking heads out there, the people that don't want to report the truth to you.
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:38.865]  I got to thank one of the sponsors and then we're going to go to some of the news that I haven't hit up.
[03:24:38.865 --> 03:24:43.210]  Just a huge stack of news I have not been able to play out and it is unbelievable.
[03:24:43.210 --> 03:24:48.035]  We're going to go through that and we're going to go to your phone calls and then Alex coming up at the end of the show.
[03:24:48.035 --> 03:24:51.199]  MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[03:24:54.482 --> 03:24:56.663]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[03:24:56.663 --> 03:24:58.883]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms, and more.
[03:24:58.883 --> 03:25:02.984]  How about an 1800 watt generator powered by the sun?
[03:25:02.984 --> 03:25:10.747]  You can get that and much, much more over at MySolarBackup.com 877-327-0365.
[03:25:10.747 --> 03:25:22.410]  Obviously, this is the most important story of the day, but we do have to hit on some of these mandatory vaccination stories because apparently there aren't mandatory vaccinations if you believe Lord Obama.
[03:25:23.471 --> 03:25:24.472]  You look at this right here.
[03:25:24.472 --> 03:25:26.154]  It's off of CBS News.
[03:25:26.154 --> 03:25:29.518]  Open letter to New York State over mandatory vaccination.
[03:25:29.518 --> 03:25:30.600]  That's the headline.
[03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:34.565]  You see, they are telling people you will lose your job if you don't take the shot.
[03:25:34.565 --> 03:25:36.267]  You will end your career.
[03:25:36.267 --> 03:25:37.569]  Take the squalene.
[03:25:37.569 --> 03:25:39.011]  Take the formaldehyde.
[03:25:39.011 --> 03:25:40.152]  Take the mercury.
[03:25:41.113 --> 03:25:44.494]  Meanwhile, you know, we talked a little bit about the police state control grid.
[03:25:44.494 --> 03:25:58.198]  I wanted to play you a video of the upcoming Google Earth and the demonstrations on how it is going to triangulate where you go to and then use CCTV cameras to show you live video images.
[03:25:58.198 --> 03:26:00.619]  This is what's available to the public, folks.
[03:26:01.099 --> 03:26:02.140]  To the public.
[03:26:02.140 --> 03:26:02.961]  Doubt me.
[03:26:02.961 --> 03:26:07.166]  I don't think we're going to have time to play it on this show, but perhaps we'll play it tomorrow.
[03:26:07.166 --> 03:26:10.550]  You know, we only have about 34 minutes and there's so much breaking news going on.
[03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:14.335]  We're going to post it over at PrisonPlanet and InfoWars.com.
[03:26:14.335 --> 03:26:16.357]  But that ties into this story.
[03:26:16.357 --> 03:26:19.701]  EU launches free satellite system to fine-tune GPS.
[03:26:19.701 --> 03:26:20.943]  Remember, they're always here to help.
[03:26:21.323 --> 03:26:23.765]  They're always here because they love you.
[03:26:23.765 --> 03:26:25.045]  No, they're not here to help.
[03:26:25.045 --> 03:26:26.646]  They're not here because they love you.
[03:26:26.646 --> 03:26:30.689]  They're here to surveil you, to put you in the control grid.
[03:26:30.689 --> 03:26:39.615]  The European Union launched a free satellite navigation network on Thursday that could help pilots, drivers, and blind people by fine-tuning the accuracy of the U.S.
[03:26:39.615 --> 03:26:43.197]  global positioning system to around 2 meters.
[03:26:43.197 --> 03:26:45.398]  They are closing in!
[03:26:45.398 --> 03:26:47.019]  That's what this is about.
[03:26:47.019 --> 03:26:49.101]  Meanwhile, the push for a carbon tax
[03:26:50.069 --> 03:26:52.612]  And climate sustainability moves on.
[03:26:52.612 --> 03:26:53.893]  Salon.com.
[03:26:53.893 --> 03:26:55.075]  What's the headline?
[03:26:55.075 --> 03:26:57.638]  Contraception bites global warming.
[03:26:57.638 --> 03:26:59.900]  This is about a one-child policy.
[03:26:59.900 --> 03:27:03.645]  This is about demonizing you for having more children.
[03:27:04.568 --> 03:27:07.910]  They're saying your carbon footprint is killing the environment.
[03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:09.291]  No, it's not.
[03:27:09.291 --> 03:27:10.672]  It's a total lie.
[03:27:10.672 --> 03:27:16.875]  Meanwhile, they've had a thousand mayors sign on to the Climate Protection Pledge.
[03:27:16.875 --> 03:27:19.196]  A lot of well-meaning idiots out there, folks.
[03:27:19.196 --> 03:27:25.340]  And I was sitting there watching Barbara Boxer grandstand yesterday on C-SPAN as I threw up in my own mouth.
[03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:27.522]  September 30, 2009, U.S.
[03:27:27.522 --> 03:27:36.150]  Conference of Mayors President, Seattle Mayor Greg Nichols says that by Friday, a thousand mayors representing 85 million Americans will have signed the U.S.
[03:27:36.150 --> 03:27:41.295]  Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement since it was introduced in February of 2005.
[03:27:41.295 --> 03:27:44.078]  The announcement of a thousandth mayoral signatory
[03:27:45.399 --> 03:27:49.604]  And his or her city will take place during the conference leadership meeting.
[03:27:49.604 --> 03:27:53.328]  This is about a push to tax you for breathing.
[03:27:53.328 --> 03:27:57.132]  This is about a push to tax you for having more than one car.
[03:27:57.132 --> 03:28:00.716]  This is about a push to tax you for having a large home.
[03:28:01.477 --> 03:28:03.178]  Total enslavement.
[03:28:03.178 --> 03:28:04.379]  And they're getting ready, folks.
[03:28:04.379 --> 03:28:11.824]  They're going into the poor areas, they're making FEMA camps, and they're bringing in private mercenary forces!
[03:28:11.824 --> 03:28:18.669]  The reason I'm yelling is because it is crazy to me that no one is standing up to this!
[03:28:18.669 --> 03:28:20.090]  It's insanity!
[03:28:20.090 --> 03:28:20.871]  It's madness!
[03:28:22.028 --> 03:28:30.750]  And meanwhile, they have this well-meaning idiot, this nice PR lady, Becky Shea, who just got the biggest paycheck of her life, and is defending it.
[03:28:30.750 --> 03:28:43.853]  Meanwhile, it's run by a multiple convicted felon, who uses over a dozen aliases, and currently has a million dollar lawsuit, in which he lost, pending against him.
[03:28:43.853 --> 03:28:45.454]  That's not Jason Burmess!
[03:28:45.454 --> 03:28:47.074]  That's the Billings Gazette!
[03:28:47.074 --> 03:28:48.775]  That's the Associated Press!
[03:28:48.775 --> 03:28:49.995]  That's USA Today!
[03:28:50.848 --> 03:28:52.649]  But you'll just tell me it doesn't exist.
[03:28:52.649 --> 03:28:56.470]  You'll laugh in my face as they point the weapons at you.
[03:28:56.470 --> 03:29:00.092]  While they speak a foreign language and tell you to comply.
[03:29:00.092 --> 03:29:05.854]  While you're on your knees with your hands on your head waiting for instructions, you'll say it doesn't exist.
[03:29:05.854 --> 03:29:15.858]  While they're taking your home, while they have your daughter or wife in the other room having their way with her as she screams for help and you can't do anything because you're a yellow-bellied coward!
[03:29:17.188 --> 03:29:19.049]  That's what's going down.
[03:29:19.049 --> 03:29:28.516]  And Alex Jones is on the ground right now, risking his well-being, risking his staff to bring this news to you because it is that important.
[03:29:28.516 --> 03:29:30.818]  It might be the story of the year.
[03:29:30.818 --> 03:29:32.939]  Meanwhile, mandatory vaccinations go on.
[03:29:32.939 --> 03:29:35.061]  They're telling the military, you have to take the shot.
[03:29:35.061 --> 03:29:36.982]  By the way, you're going to take an anthrax shot, too.
[03:29:36.982 --> 03:29:37.762]  How do you like that?
[03:29:37.762 --> 03:29:39.664]  We're going to take your calls after this.
[03:29:39.664 --> 03:29:41.725]  Alex Jones coming up.
[03:29:41.725 --> 03:29:45.468]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Jason Burmas subbing in for Alex.
[03:29:51.536 --> 03:29:55.482]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.482 --> 03:29:58.166]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.101 --> 03:30:05.342]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.342 --> 03:30:07.342]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.342 --> 03:30:15.864]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.864 --> 03:30:21.406]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.406 --> 03:30:23.026]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.266 --> 03:30:29.792]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.792 --> 03:30:40.842]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.842 --> 03:30:41.623]  That's right.
[03:30:41.623 --> 03:30:44.185]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.185 --> 03:30:45.766]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:47.688 --> 03:30:48.348]  We're good to go.
[03:31:04.617 --> 03:31:05.297]  It's here!
[03:31:05.297 --> 03:31:10.440]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[03:31:10.440 --> 03:31:18.784]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.784 --> 03:31:26.228]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.228 --> 03:31:33.111]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[03:31:33.607 --> 03:31:37.948]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:37.948 --> 03:31:41.929]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.929 --> 03:31:44.189]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.189 --> 03:31:48.630]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:32:01.348 --> 03:32:07.231]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:32:07.231 --> 03:32:12.353]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:32:12.353 --> 03:32:13.573]  That was then.
[03:32:13.573 --> 03:32:14.874]  This is now.
[03:32:14.874 --> 03:32:17.055]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:32:17.595 --> 03:32:23.637]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:32:23.637 --> 03:32:32.860]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:32:32.860 --> 03:32:35.601]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:32:36.321 --> 03:32:40.803]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:32:40.803 --> 03:32:42.304]  Video never lies.
[03:32:42.304 --> 03:32:43.984]  Watch Big Brother back.
[03:32:43.984 --> 03:32:45.765]  Visit Diginet.net.
[03:32:45.765 --> 03:32:48.726]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[03:32:48.726 --> 03:32:51.347]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[03:32:51.347 --> 03:32:53.028]  Diginet dot net.
[03:32:53.028 --> 03:32:53.508]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[03:32:53.508 --> 03:32:53.708]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[03:33:12.765 --> 03:33:16.428]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:33:16.428 --> 03:33:19.370]  Run on for a long time.
[03:33:19.370 --> 03:33:22.192]  Run on for a long time.
[03:33:22.192 --> 03:33:25.194]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:33:25.194 --> 03:33:28.096]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:33:28.096 --> 03:33:34.220]  Gore Vidal will have a dictatorship soon in the United States and he doesn't know how right he is.
[03:33:34.220 --> 03:33:37.082]  This is the Times Online out of the UK.
[03:33:38.363 --> 03:33:43.867]  Just an extensive article about how he too was duped by Obama and he thought that change was coming.
[03:33:43.867 --> 03:33:48.151]  Well the change is here and it's not what anybody expected and he's calling it like he sees it.
[03:33:48.151 --> 03:33:57.078]  We'll have a dictatorship soon in the United States and one of those steps is having privatized mercenary and military forces on the streets.
[03:33:57.078 --> 03:34:00.180]  And it's happening in Hardin, Montana as we speak.
[03:34:00.180 --> 03:34:02.142]  We're going to open the phone lines up.
[03:34:02.142 --> 03:34:03.383]  Matt in Montana.
[03:34:03.383 --> 03:34:05.605]  Matt, you're on the line.
[03:34:05.605 --> 03:34:06.805]  Yes, sir.
[03:34:06.805 --> 03:34:07.326]  How's it going?
[03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:09.931]  It's rough today, I'm not going to lie.
[03:34:09.931 --> 03:34:13.133]  This is a tough story to deal with because it is reality.
[03:34:13.133 --> 03:34:20.337]  I've got to tell you, me and a friend investigated the scene yesterday before Alex got there.
[03:34:20.337 --> 03:34:26.160]  I was trying to get ahold of you guys, but it's really hard to get ahold of you.
[03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:30.302]  We got in and we interviewed Becky Shea.
[03:34:30.302 --> 03:34:35.445]  I got a lot of great footage of every spot, every room.
[03:34:36.428 --> 03:34:45.894]  A lot of good stuff like that, but we were there for a few hours and we did not see... I'm just really nervous, sorry.
[03:34:45.894 --> 03:34:48.276]  That's okay.
[03:34:48.276 --> 03:34:53.239]  We didn't see any Blackhawk helicopters or any paramilitary forces around.
[03:34:53.239 --> 03:35:00.764]  The only thing we saw was her SUV just come up right to us as we got into the parking lot.
[03:35:00.764 --> 03:35:03.386]  And did it have the decals on at that point or had they taken them off?
[03:35:05.689 --> 03:35:06.209]  I don't know.
[03:35:24.782 --> 03:35:29.869]  Well, I mean, she's a well-meaning person who's been thrust into this position.
[03:35:29.869 --> 03:35:33.253]  She probably didn't think it was going to be such a media storm so quickly.
[03:35:33.253 --> 03:35:40.403]  But let's just look at the American police force decals that were on there and how Orwellian and what they represent.
[03:35:40.643 --> 03:35:42.584]  First of all, they're not Americans, okay?
[03:35:42.584 --> 03:35:44.645]  This guy, Michael Hilton, not an American.
[03:35:44.645 --> 03:35:51.047]  He's a convicted felon with numerous aliases with ties to foreign government and mercenary agencies.
[03:35:51.047 --> 03:35:53.208]  Number two, they're not a police force.
[03:35:53.208 --> 03:35:56.609]  They admittedly cannot police the public there.
[03:35:56.609 --> 03:35:57.850]  So what is going on?
[03:35:57.850 --> 03:35:59.790]  They're prepping the American public.
[03:35:59.790 --> 03:36:03.952]  Again, just because there weren't troops there yesterday or perhaps today doesn't mean they're not
[03:36:04.372 --> 03:36:05.353]  You know, going to bring them in.
[03:36:05.353 --> 03:36:10.236]  I mean, if you read the Associated Press stories, she says, yes, this will be a training facility.
[03:36:10.236 --> 03:36:15.359]  The only thing that she's denying is that it will be used as a Gitmo-type detention center.
[03:36:15.359 --> 03:36:19.642]  So she's saying that all the prisoners that are going to be held here will be domestic.
[03:36:19.642 --> 03:36:21.143]  In other words, from the United States.
[03:36:21.143 --> 03:36:24.826]  But they don't necessarily have to be from Montana, which is also troubling.
[03:36:24.826 --> 03:36:31.370]  But what troubles me the most is who they put in charge, how this is a private operation, and how they're bringing in foreign troops, Matt.
[03:36:31.570 --> 03:36:32.451]  Thank you for having me on.
[03:36:32.451 --> 03:36:33.432]  I spoke to Blackwater directly today.
[03:36:33.432 --> 03:36:36.876]  I wanted to point out that earlier today, the gentleman you thought
[03:36:53.854 --> 03:36:58.516]  He spoke to Blackwater, actually had corrected himself and said he spoke to APF.
[03:36:58.516 --> 03:37:00.276]  I called Blackwater myself.
[03:37:00.276 --> 03:37:04.258]  They adamantly deny this.
[03:37:04.258 --> 03:37:14.662]  Basically what they said is, the lady who answered the phone, as soon as I brought up APF and Montana, she transferred me to a lady who would not identify herself.
[03:37:14.662 --> 03:37:19.464]  Wanted to know who I was, what organization I was with, what part of the country I was from.
[03:37:20.317 --> 03:37:21.378]  I don't think so.
[03:37:42.335 --> 03:37:45.317]  That is what they told me, and I want to urge people to call 252-435-2488.
[03:37:45.317 --> 03:37:49.739]  That is the direct number to U.S.
[03:37:49.739 --> 03:37:58.483]  Training Center, which is the place in North Carolina that you guys have posted in some of your articles.
[03:37:58.483 --> 03:38:10.770]  And they won't identify who they are or who you're speaking with, and they'll ask a lot of questions of you, but they will... I just encourage everyone to call there and ask questions and to find out what is really going on here.
[03:38:11.337 --> 03:38:11.817]  Absolutely.
[03:38:11.817 --> 03:38:13.098]  Thank you so much for the call, Paul.
[03:38:13.098 --> 03:38:14.319]  Let's go to Karen in Oregon.
[03:38:14.319 --> 03:38:17.121]  Karen, you're on the line.
[03:38:17.121 --> 03:38:18.542]  Yes, Karen.
[03:38:18.542 --> 03:38:20.283]  Paul Stason.
[03:38:20.283 --> 03:38:21.023]  What?
[03:38:21.023 --> 03:38:21.784]  Can you hear me?
[03:38:21.784 --> 03:38:21.944]  Yes.
[03:38:22.859 --> 03:38:31.106]  What I am advocating and what my people are advocating is a national strike on the 15th of October.
[03:38:31.106 --> 03:38:35.130]  We've had way too many reasons to take this strike.
[03:38:35.130 --> 03:38:38.713]  Gandhi says we need three things for a successful revolution.
[03:38:38.713 --> 03:38:43.057]  We need to be proactive, non-violent, and massive in numbers.
[03:38:43.057 --> 03:38:44.698]  We're asking people to prepare themselves
[03:38:46.206 --> 03:38:47.367]  We're good to go.
[03:39:16.647 --> 03:39:17.688]  We're good to go.
[03:39:31.218 --> 03:39:34.922]  We are supporting this corrupt government gone wild.
[03:39:34.922 --> 03:39:49.255]  We're basically going along to get along when we do these things and we don't take action and, you know, we're willing to take a check and say, yeah, I'll be your PR spokeswoman or we're willing to allow this prison system to occur because, yeah, we're economically destitute.
[03:39:49.255 --> 03:39:50.556]  Please go check that out.
[03:39:50.556 --> 03:39:52.978]  I encourage people to take action and she's right.
[03:39:52.978 --> 03:39:55.561]  Gandhi had the correct idea.
[03:39:55.561 --> 03:39:56.722]  We need to peaceably
[03:39:57.162 --> 03:40:01.865]  Resist in large numbers and make people aware of what's truly going on.
[03:40:01.865 --> 03:40:03.226]  Kathy in New Orleans.
[03:40:03.226 --> 03:40:05.788]  Kathy, you're on the line.
[03:40:05.788 --> 03:40:08.470]  Yes, Kathy.
[03:40:08.470 --> 03:40:09.091]  Hello?
[03:40:09.091 --> 03:40:10.732]  Yes.
[03:40:10.732 --> 03:40:16.796]  Jason, this is Kathy from New Orleans, and I'm sorry, I'm actually speaking to a minister right now.
[03:40:16.796 --> 03:40:18.798]  I had to excuse myself.
[03:40:18.798 --> 03:40:26.023]  I'm with Gary King with Patriot Radio New Orleans, and we get to talk to Dr. Ray Malabo every single week.
[03:40:26.955 --> 03:40:36.602]  And she, we spoke to her a couple days ago and today it's going, they're trying to have a lawsuit with the FDA.
[03:40:36.602 --> 03:40:44.027]  Well you know what, these lawsuits, and I thank you for the call Kathy, in my mind they don't go anywhere.
[03:40:44.027 --> 03:40:44.407]  Alright?
[03:40:44.407 --> 03:40:49.230]  They don't even make people that aware other than within the Patriot Network that already knows what's going on.
[03:40:49.230 --> 03:40:55.895]  I'm not saying don't try, don't try to get your message out there, don't try to take legal action, but we know about the mandatory vaccinations.
[03:40:56.135 --> 03:41:04.221]  We know the entire military, including the National Guard and Department of Defense personnel, are being forced to take the inoculation.
[03:41:04.221 --> 03:41:16.771]  We know they are telling students that if they don't take the inoculation and are absent for 10 days, which will be unexcused, they will become truant, they will have to redo that grade, and in many cases, CPS will come after your kids.
[03:41:16.771 --> 03:41:19.333]  We are living under a nightmare scenario.
[03:41:19.333 --> 03:41:21.535]  Let's go to Michael in Massachusetts.
[03:41:21.535 --> 03:41:23.536]  Michael, you're on the line.
[03:41:23.536 --> 03:41:24.857]  Jason, what's up, brother?
[03:41:24.857 --> 03:41:25.378]  How you doing, sir?
[03:41:26.047 --> 03:41:28.128]  All this stuff, it's like right out of Jericho, isn't it?
[03:41:28.128 --> 03:41:28.948]  Do you see that show?
[03:41:28.948 --> 03:41:30.749]  Seriously, but this is like an opportunity.
[03:41:30.749 --> 03:41:34.171]  I mean, like, imagine, like, we're getting at, what was it, Ravenclaw or something like that?
[03:41:45.382 --> 03:41:50.165]  Ravenwood was the private security force that they used there.
[03:41:50.165 --> 03:41:52.687]  Only they made people clamor for the inoculations.
[03:41:52.687 --> 03:41:54.429]  The inoculations weren't bad.
[03:41:54.429 --> 03:42:02.175]  Ravenwood, which is a Blackwater parody, was protecting the inoculations and the people had to fight to get their inoculations.
[03:42:02.175 --> 03:42:09.321]  So even in a show that exposed a lot of the quote-unquote NWO agenda, there was propaganda lying throughout.
[03:42:09.321 --> 03:42:12.383]  Hey, have you guys talked to Jeremy Scahill yet?
[03:42:12.383 --> 03:42:13.204]  I'm not sure who that is.
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:19.387]  Jeremy Scahill is kind of like the authority on all things Blackwater.
[03:42:19.387 --> 03:42:21.890]  He was a contributor to that Democracy Now!
[03:42:21.890 --> 03:42:23.773]  show a lot.
[03:42:23.773 --> 03:42:31.662]  And keeping in the philosophy of Webster Toplin attacking from the left, I think it might be a great idea if he gets to get Jeremy Scahill on it.
[03:42:31.662 --> 03:42:32.844]  Infowars has posted
[03:42:33.539 --> 03:42:39.583]  A number of his articles and he appears to be a very independent person and knows everything.
[03:42:39.583 --> 03:42:54.072]  Well my producers are telling me that they've tried several times to get him on the program but so far he's been uninterested and unfortunately people who are stuck in that left-right paradigm often don't want to come on the program, don't want to discuss things that they would discuss on say a Democracy Now!
[03:42:54.332 --> 03:42:56.232]  Which I think is a great news outlet.
[03:42:56.232 --> 03:43:01.614]  You know, 90% of the stuff that comes out there is great and we do cover here at Infowars.com.
[03:43:01.614 --> 03:43:03.974]  So if we can get them, we will definitely try.
[03:43:03.974 --> 03:43:05.174]  I thank you for the call.
[03:43:05.174 --> 03:43:06.955]  Let's go to Steven in Texas.
[03:43:06.955 --> 03:43:08.575]  Steven, you're online.
[03:43:08.575 --> 03:43:09.475]  Yeah, hey Jason.
[03:43:09.475 --> 03:43:17.957]  First of all, I wanted to say I was praying for you and I'm so glad that you made it safely out of the illegal gathering zone in Pittsburgh.
[03:43:18.909 --> 03:43:20.751]  Uh, that was pretty scary.
[03:43:20.751 --> 03:43:25.635]  I watched with horror all the video from that, but it doesn't surprise me.
[03:43:25.635 --> 03:43:28.077]  Um, I wanted to say a couple things.
[03:43:28.077 --> 03:43:30.859]  First of all, I just talked to a good friend of mine last night.
[03:43:30.859 --> 03:43:41.347]  I want to comment on this Montana situation because I actually called out there, wasn't able to go, but I talked to a good friend of mine last night here, and he was having some problems with his electric.
[03:43:41.347 --> 03:43:46.551]  So he contacted the electric company, Entergy, and they finally got his electric on.
[03:43:46.551 --> 03:43:47.332]  He just bought a house.
[03:43:47.878 --> 03:43:53.532]  But they told him that they are going to be replacing the current meters they have.
[03:43:54.150 --> 03:43:57.971]  With meters that are all GPS compatible.
[03:43:57.971 --> 03:43:59.011]  Oh, how lovely.
[03:43:59.011 --> 03:44:05.492]  They're electric, so they will be able to read the electric via GPS and not have to send people out anymore.
[03:44:05.492 --> 03:44:13.294]  Well, it is the new cashless society control grid that they're building with RFID and biometric technology, as well as GPS technology.
[03:44:13.294 --> 03:44:20.215]  And like I said, what Google Earth is about to present to people, what they just showed in a demonstration this week, is unbelievable.
[03:44:20.215 --> 03:44:20.915]  You'll be able to
[03:44:21.375 --> 03:44:32.437]  Zoom in on a live area where we'll give you live CCTV camera footage of what's going on on that street, on that, uh, in that town, on that highway.
[03:44:32.437 --> 03:44:34.577]  It's simply unbelievable the times we're living in.
[03:44:34.577 --> 03:44:47.880]  I've seen the stuff they have on Google Earth just where you can look at a neighborhood, but the day that Alex, that, uh, this information about what's going on in Harrington City was posted on InfoWars, I think it was Monday,
[03:44:48.736 --> 03:44:53.500]  I immediately, I'm proactive, I called to the sheriff's office there.
[03:44:53.500 --> 03:44:55.542]  I also talked to City Hall.
[03:44:55.542 --> 03:44:58.084]  I couldn't get anyone with the council.
[03:44:58.084 --> 03:45:02.308]  And the woman with the sheriff's office told me the sheriff's not here.
[03:45:02.308 --> 03:45:04.530]  Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.
[03:45:05.089 --> 03:45:09.252]  He was conveniently not there, but I brought up to her about this.
[03:45:09.252 --> 03:45:11.893]  First, when I brought it up, I called Alex the other day.
[03:45:11.893 --> 03:45:14.074]  She immediately said, well, it's fake.
[03:45:14.074 --> 03:45:14.715]  I said, what?
[03:45:14.715 --> 03:45:15.755]  She said, yeah, it's fake.
[03:45:15.755 --> 03:45:23.220]  I said, ma'am, I saw the video from the newscasters with these guys with APF coming in with Hardin City Police.
[03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:26.542]  Well, they took that off the vehicles, you know, like that made it okay.
[03:45:26.542 --> 03:45:30.024]  And I just, you know, gave her a rundown about what this is really about.
[03:45:30.744 --> 03:45:32.565]  And she thanked me, and that was the end of that.
[03:45:32.565 --> 03:45:34.126]  Well, look at the guys, Stephen.
[03:45:34.126 --> 03:45:35.167]  Stephen, look at the guys.
[03:45:35.167 --> 03:45:39.409]  They're presenting themselves not only as a police force, but an American police force.
[03:45:39.409 --> 03:45:42.671]  And then you have the crest of Serbia above it, number one.
[03:45:42.671 --> 03:45:50.436]  Number two, we know that these are foreign mercenaries, and the head of this is a convicted felon with over a dozen aliases.
[03:45:50.436 --> 03:45:52.197]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:45:52.197 --> 03:45:54.599]  This is straight out of a James Bond movie.
[03:45:54.599 --> 03:45:55.879]  It's unbelievable.
[03:45:55.879 --> 03:45:56.520]  I gotta jump.
[03:45:56.520 --> 03:45:57.921]  I thank you for the call, Stephen.
[03:45:57.921 --> 03:45:59.421]  Let's go to Kevin in New York.
[03:45:59.421 --> 03:46:00.162]  Kevin, you're on the line.
[03:46:00.916 --> 03:46:03.378]  Hey Jason, great show today.
[03:46:03.378 --> 03:46:12.465]  I just wanted to let your listeners know that a great place to start with this whole Montana incident here is the actual architectural blueprints.
[03:46:12.465 --> 03:46:15.687]  If they put up a public bond, they should be in the public domain.
[03:46:15.687 --> 03:46:20.491]  In the bottom hand ledger, there'll be names, there'll be the engineering firm,
[03:46:21.098 --> 03:46:25.682]  It'd be a first place to pull the string in this situation.
[03:46:25.682 --> 03:46:28.064]  People have to sign this off.
[03:46:28.064 --> 03:46:40.393]  Becky Shea's sitting there saying, yes, you did see some documents where they said foreign alien detainment, but then she won't reveal who the supposed contractors were before the APF came in.
[03:46:40.393 --> 03:46:41.554]  I gotta jump, Kevin.
[03:46:41.554 --> 03:46:48.240]  I've got Alex on the line with his final intel report on the streets of Hardin, Montana.
[03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:48.420]  Alex,
[03:46:50.410 --> 03:46:57.236]  Yes, the spokesperson for American Police Force, itself a cut out for another company, itself another cut out to foreign Merck firms.
[03:46:57.236 --> 03:46:58.357]  That's confirmed.
[03:46:58.357 --> 03:46:59.679]  She's now getting very agitated.
[03:46:59.679 --> 03:47:01.060]  There's a bunch of local media here.
[03:47:01.060 --> 03:47:03.162]  It's now on national news.
[03:47:03.162 --> 03:47:04.703]  And we've talked to locals.
[03:47:04.703 --> 03:47:06.885]  They were patrolling around here last week.
[03:47:06.885 --> 03:47:13.531]  That's when all this started, about a week and a half ago, when the vehicles didn't break on the news until the weekend.
[03:47:13.531 --> 03:47:14.993]  They did put decals on these black
[03:47:16.106 --> 03:47:18.411]  Mercedes SUVs, they are driving around.
[03:47:18.411 --> 03:47:21.979]  Then earlier in the week they tried to say that was a conspiracy theory and none of that was happening.
[03:47:21.979 --> 03:47:24.265]  Now they've had to admit that they were here.
[03:47:24.265 --> 03:47:25.467]  This type of stuff.
[03:47:26.115 --> 03:47:27.436]  Was going on.
[03:47:27.436 --> 03:47:38.664]  We've been getting followed by men in black sedans, also similar red trucks with men in camouflage have been seen by us and by locals that are here all over the town.
[03:47:38.664 --> 03:47:42.407]  There's all sorts of weird military drills going on here.
[03:47:42.407 --> 03:47:50.172]  And again, you have Germans, you have Serbs, you have Czech Republic, you have Brits, you have others here.
[03:47:50.172 --> 03:47:55.476]  They've all basically fled the facility, but they're still in the town.
[03:47:56.648 --> 03:48:04.252]  And I knew this was a big story whenever we found out that they were putting the police insignias on the side of their cars.
[03:48:04.252 --> 03:48:10.236]  What we know is happening is, is two rivers basically is an authority.
[03:48:10.236 --> 03:48:16.219]  And it's quasi-public-private group, kind of like the LCRA in Central Texas taking over the water supply, hiring their own SWAT teams.
[03:48:16.949 --> 03:48:27.792]  And what they've done is a power grab here, the evidence shows, and the spokesman in several newscasts earlier this week and over the weekend admitted, well, we had a wish list to have them be local police.
[03:48:27.792 --> 03:48:39.916]  So imagine this, you have a paramilitary foreign secretive group run by a 14-time felon from Serbia with his bizarre father in tow with German troops, very serious military.
[03:48:40.836 --> 03:48:42.457]  Uh, Types, uh, here with them.
[03:48:42.457 --> 03:48:44.538]  More reporters are now arriving.
[03:48:44.538 --> 03:48:45.719]  All of this is going on.
[03:48:45.719 --> 03:48:53.022]  Uh, you have them admitting to us that they want to put a giant paramilitary training facility for police, military, foreign mercenaries.
[03:48:53.022 --> 03:48:54.843]  You name it, that's all admitted.
[03:48:54.843 --> 03:48:56.804]  You have them wanting to expand the prison facility.
[03:48:56.804 --> 03:48:59.265]  It is huge, $27 million.
[03:48:59.265 --> 03:49:02.447]  Just, just, I've shot video on the wall of blueprints.
[03:49:03.726 --> 03:49:04.447]  We're good to go.
[03:49:21.351 --> 03:49:28.033]  For this facility, a poor American police force, that is anything but American, that is running it.
[03:49:28.033 --> 03:49:33.235]  And now the media is in there grilling her, saying, tell us who the secret group is that really owns it.
[03:49:33.235 --> 03:49:36.156]  Tell us who the secret group is that really owns it.
[03:49:36.156 --> 03:49:38.877]  Tell us who the secret group is that really owns it.
[03:49:38.877 --> 03:49:39.878]  Over and over again.
[03:49:39.878 --> 03:49:46.480]  But earlier when they thought they could sell to the public, in April they admitted that they wanted to carry out
[03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:47.680]  We're good to go.
[03:50:05.374 --> 03:50:07.175]  The locals keep asking, well, why are you taking over?
[03:50:07.175 --> 03:50:08.896]  Why are you moving in foreign soldiers?
[03:50:08.896 --> 03:50:09.776]  Why are you doing all this?
[03:50:09.776 --> 03:50:11.177]  Why are you saying it's not a FEMA camp?
[03:50:11.177 --> 03:50:16.199]  See, in April, the locals said, we don't want this to be Guantanamo Bay West, as CNN called it.
[03:50:16.199 --> 03:50:20.221]  And so they said, OK, well, we're just going to put regular prisoners there, but we're not going to talk about it.
[03:50:20.221 --> 03:50:21.842]  And they keep saying everything is secret.
[03:50:21.842 --> 03:50:25.563]  So the fact that it's a secret is only making it get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[03:50:25.563 --> 03:50:28.845]  But this is definitely, at bare minimum, been looked at.
[03:50:29.602 --> 03:50:33.224]  We'll be back with Alex Jones in just a minute.
[03:50:33.224 --> 03:50:35.286]  The latest over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:51:03.350 --> 03:51:05.351]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:05.351 --> 03:51:11.134]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:11.134 --> 03:51:12.475]  Will they do it?
[03:51:12.475 --> 03:51:15.096]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.096 --> 03:51:21.040]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.553 --> 03:51:23.754]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:23.754 --> 03:51:28.035]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.035 --> 03:51:32.916]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:32.916 --> 03:51:37.817]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:37.817 --> 03:51:42.639]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.559 --> 03:51:51.982]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:51.982 --> 03:51:54.483]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:54.483 --> 03:51:57.544]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:51:57.544 --> 03:52:00.465]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:52:02.085 --> 03:52:07.890]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.890 --> 03:52:15.477]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.477 --> 03:52:21.643]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.063 --> 03:52:24.024]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.024 --> 03:52:26.525]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.525 --> 03:52:38.110]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:39.791]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.791 --> 03:52:41.652]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.652 --> 03:52:47.875]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.539 --> 03:52:56.810]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.810 --> 03:52:58.392]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.392 --> 03:52:59.573]  The people strike back!
[03:53:01.741 --> 03:53:12.633]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:53:12.633 --> 03:53:16.818]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:53:16.818 --> 03:53:18.560]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:24.583]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:24.583 --> 03:53:34.608]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:53:34.608 --> 03:53:41.111]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:53:41.111 --> 03:53:44.473]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:53:44.473 --> 03:53:46.514]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:53:46.514 --> 03:53:48.395]  It simply needs some help so it has
[03:53:48.775 --> 03:53:49.516]  I think so.
[03:54:04.875 --> 03:54:06.957]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:06.957 --> 03:54:09.600]  The enemy continues to attack.
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:13.925]  This is off the tworiversauthority.org website.
[03:54:13.925 --> 03:54:15.167]  Let me read it right here.
[03:54:15.167 --> 03:54:18.551]  It's right here for prisonplanet.tv subscribers.
[03:54:18.551 --> 03:54:25.399]  The stories by Steve Quayle and Alex Jones in regards to Hardin TRA and detention center are not true.
[03:54:25.819 --> 03:54:31.003]  We have no idea where they got this information, but there is absolutely no validity to these articles.
[03:54:31.003 --> 03:54:33.304]  There is no fencer gate being built around Hardin.
[03:54:33.304 --> 03:54:40.970]  People are not being put in jail for refusing the swine flu shot, and our city is not being taken over by a private police agency.
[03:54:40.970 --> 03:54:41.951]  Yet they have...
[03:54:42.651 --> 03:54:49.472]  American police force on the side of their cars that she admitted that they are going to be training foreign mercenaries.
[03:54:49.472 --> 03:55:10.916]  The person that they have put in charge according to the Billings Gazette and now the Associated Press and now USA Today, these are mainline sources folks, is a multiple felon with multiple aliases who has lost civil suits in which he owes over a million dollars and he is posed as a car salesman, as an entrepreneur, as an arts dealer, as a restaurant owner.
[03:55:11.849 --> 03:55:16.731]  As somebody who advised on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:55:16.731 --> 03:55:21.514]  This Hilton character or whatever his name is, is bad news brown.
[03:55:21.514 --> 03:55:24.355]  They are eviscerating the country.
[03:55:24.355 --> 03:55:30.959]  That's what this is about and now they are attacking on the actual website of the prison.
[03:55:30.959 --> 03:55:33.500]  Remember this prison put into place in 2007 under the Bush administration.
[03:55:36.101 --> 03:55:38.963]  And the agenda continues through the Obama administration.
[03:55:38.963 --> 03:55:42.926]  If you missed any of the program today, so much hard-hitting info.
[03:55:42.926 --> 03:55:44.387]  You missed any of the four hours.
[03:55:44.387 --> 03:55:46.188]  You need the podcast immediately.
[03:55:46.188 --> 03:55:48.269]  You need to listen to the rebroadcast.
[03:55:48.269 --> 03:56:05.681]  You need to hear out of Becky Shea's own mouth how she doesn't want to discuss who is actually running this operation and how she refuses to discuss the people that were running the operation prior to the secret organization who's running the operation now and how they want to make this Guantanamo West.
[03:56:06.882 --> 03:56:14.452]  She just outright denies it, but then says, oh yeah, that paperwork was there about detaining illegal aliens from, uh, you know, foreign groups.
[03:56:15.584 --> 03:56:16.865]  What's going on here?
[03:56:16.865 --> 03:56:18.426]  We've lost the country, folks.
[03:56:18.426 --> 03:56:30.596]  We continue to lose it with every breath we take, with every denial we put out there, with all the willful ignorance, and the shopping, and the iPhones, and, oh, the Angels are in the playoffs!
[03:56:30.596 --> 03:56:31.597]  Who cares?
[03:56:31.597 --> 03:56:33.659]  Who cares about sports at this point?
[03:56:33.659 --> 03:56:35.360]  This is our country we're talking about.
[03:56:35.360 --> 03:56:42.766]  If you still want to get boxed seats to that game next season, maybe you should step up to the plate and see what's going on in your own country.
[03:56:43.786 --> 03:56:48.411]  Remember the headline over at PrisonPlanet.tv right now and PrisonPlanet.com is exposed.
[03:56:48.411 --> 03:56:52.455]  American Police Force is a Black Water Front Group.
[03:56:52.455 --> 03:56:54.497]  Please get the articles.
[03:56:54.497 --> 03:56:58.621]  Circulate them to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[03:56:58.621 --> 03:56:59.702]  Save humanity.
[03:56:59.702 --> 03:57:02.605]  You have incredible power within you.
[03:57:02.605 --> 03:57:03.526]  We have so many people
[03:57:03.966 --> 03:57:18.580]  on the ground now in Hardin Montana reporting the truth Michael Hollingsworth we can't commend him enough for coming on yesterday and today a man with great military experience and expertise who is looking at this and knows what it is
[03:57:19.401 --> 03:57:22.462]  It is a foreign globalist takeover.
[03:57:22.462 --> 03:57:24.883]  It is the end of America.
[03:57:24.883 --> 03:57:28.684]  When we praise China in this country, we better look out.
[03:57:28.684 --> 03:57:29.524]  What are our morals?
[03:57:29.524 --> 03:57:30.444]  What are our values?
[03:57:30.444 --> 03:57:31.605]  What do we stand for?
[03:57:31.605 --> 03:57:33.405]  What do we truly believe in?
[03:57:33.405 --> 03:57:36.146]  Do we believe in standing up to tyranny?
[03:57:36.146 --> 03:57:37.806]  To speaking the truth?
[03:57:37.806 --> 03:57:43.468]  Or are we just going to regurgitate what the mainstream media and political figures tell us is happening?
[03:57:44.088 --> 03:57:47.591]  Are we going to bow down to our globalist masters?
[03:57:47.591 --> 03:57:51.714]  Are we going to step up to the plate and say, NO!
[03:57:51.714 --> 03:57:54.536]  We still have some semblance of the First Amendment left.
[03:57:54.536 --> 03:57:56.358]  I'm going to make my voice heard!
[03:57:58.709 --> 03:58:01.991]  All this and more over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:58:01.991 --> 03:58:04.993]  Again, Alex Jones in Montana as we speak.
[03:58:04.993 --> 03:58:09.816]  He will be reporting live, live from Hardin, Montana tomorrow.
[03:58:09.816 --> 03:58:15.059]  Folks, now is the time to step up to the plate and swing the bat.
[03:58:15.059 --> 03:58:19.482]  It's time to say no more tyranny.
[03:58:19.482 --> 03:58:21.203]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:58:21.203 --> 03:58:23.864]  Again, get the podcast, listen to the rebroadcast.
[03:58:23.864 --> 03:58:25.745]  So much important information.
[03:58:25.745 --> 03:58:26.506]  God bless you all.
[03:58:43.007 --> 03:58:46.530]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.530 --> 03:58:51.374]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.374 --> 03:58:54.777]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.777 --> 03:58:58.400]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.400 --> 03:59:02.964]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.964 --> 03:59:08.569]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.849 --> 03:59:13.612]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.612 --> 03:59:17.235]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.235 --> 03:59:22.058]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.058 --> 03:59:28.622]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.622 --> 03:59:30.544]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.104 --> 03:59:33.245]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[03:59:33.245 --> 03:59:36.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
