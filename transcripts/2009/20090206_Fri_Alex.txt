[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.361]  Moron for your mind.
[00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:09.424]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, locked and loaded.
[00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:17.451]  We are now simulcasting for the last hour and 52 minutes at PrisonPlanet.tv for all of the viewers there.
[00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:20.374]  I want to thank them for their ongoing support.
[00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:30.063]  Don't forget, we then post the archive of the TV segment of the radio show every day at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for the members
[00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:38.232]  And then, folks, we want you to burn it to disk, give it out to people in your area, and spread the word.
[00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:42.533]  It is your support of PrisonPlanet.tv that makes so much of what we do here possible.
[00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:53.695]  That's why we're building a big web 2.0, PrisonPlanet.tv, with a whole bunch of great features, and easier to find the 3,000 plus pieces of media, all of my films, and so much more that are there.
[00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:54.915]  So that's all ongoing.
[00:00:55.435 --> 00:01:00.056]  Right now I've got meetings about that today, and web designers, and web consultants, and back-end IT people.
[00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:02.057]  Got flying in from Chicago.
[00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:04.118]  Got to get a lot done here.
[00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.059]  So we are definitely expanding PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:15.782]  And we've extended that year-end special, because I forgot about it, that we still are offering it five plus months free, and that goes until Tuesday morning.
[00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:21.304]  Five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.TV, so check it out.
[00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:26.118]  We're going to spend about 20-30 minutes of this interview with Steve.
[00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:27.639]  We're going to get into some other issues with him.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.063]  Joining us from London, England, he runs with his brother Paul Watson.
[00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:40.909]  These are contractors out there running PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net.
[00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.214]  And he has been writing this series about Blackjack.
[00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:52.658]  It is the name of a cartoon, you could call it, but it's only posterized photos.
[00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.442]  And we'll start putting those on screen.
[00:01:56.442 --> 00:02:12.510]  Where somebody nukes major cities in England and the United States, and then martial law is brought in, people are put in FEMA camps, the Union of North America, UNE is set up, basically everything the globalists are actually planning and what they say in their own policy reports.
[00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:17.520]  In the first part of the series, though, it doesn't let you know it's the government.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.922]  It's an MI6 intelligence report you see.
[00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:22.044]  We'll put that first part up on screen.
[00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:25.887]  And they're talking about MI6 things terrorists are about to strike.
[00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:32.072]  But then later you learn that it's really basically a bunch of guys in a CENTCOM-type command center.
[00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:34.353]  Is this a warning from the London Telegraph?
[00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:37.655]  Are they trying to warn the world what's happening?
[00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:38.836]  But they're establishment owned.
[00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:42.317]  Why did Fox TV News Corp put out The Lone Gunman?
[00:02:42.657 --> 00:02:49.141]  Where the government hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan six months before the real attacks.
[00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:58.125]  They even use a drill of hijacked jets flying into buildings to basically make everybody stand down.
[00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:00.297]  That's exactly what happened in real life.
[00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.078]  And they do this over and over again.
[00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:10.524]  They came out with a Tom Clancy video game eight years ago, where the United States, through the Georgians, sneak attacks South Ossetia.
[00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:12.206]  I mean, what is this?
[00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:13.266]  Is it good?
[00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:14.007]  Is it a warning?
[00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:18.810]  Why won't the paper, after tons of inquiries, tell people what is going on?
[00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:20.592]  And can we put that on screen, guys?
[00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.890]  We're working on that?
[00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.492]  Good, because I want to put some of the comic images.
[00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:26.872]  There it is.
[00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:29.834]  MI5 report warns government of imminent terrorist attack.
[00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:32.175]  June 20th, 2 p.m.
[00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:37.559]  A coalition of homegrown extremists, Islamist and Christian doomsday cultists.
[00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.660]  See, they're going to train everybody.
[00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:47.430]  See, the London Telegraph couldn't come out and say, Christians, Doomsday, Cultists is what the anti-terrorist system is for.
[00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:55.742]  We're going to swing this giant anti-terrorist system and the drug war system onto the American people, onto the British people, and say that everybody's a white Al Qaeda.
[00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.184]  Though some media is doing that.
[00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:00.227]  This is a way to just get this into the nomenclature and the idea.
[00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:05.611]  Such a strike may take place from a biological, chemical, or even a nuclear attack in one of our main population centers.
[00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:06.332]  And it goes on.
[00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.374]  Let's go ahead and bring up Steve Watson.
[00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:12.877]  Human intelligence indicates this group is ready to strike at any time.
[00:04:14.178 --> 00:04:17.260]  In the event of such an attack, the likelihood of many thousands of casualties is high.
[00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.243]  So it teaches you that Prime Minister takes statement on threat.
[00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:24.466]  Breaking news, Prime Minister addresses House of Threat.
[00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:27.328]  And they show Gordon Brown, the current
[00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.176]  Prime Minister.
[00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:32.117]  They have this obsession with scripting.
[00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:46.662]  They had a FX show, Oil Storm, with the mayor of New Orleans himself, in the film, where the hurricane goes in, blows over, floods Lake Pontchartrain, breaks things, and exactly what happened, that happens.
[00:04:47.062 --> 00:04:48.182]  That aired a year before Katrina.
[00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:50.163]  Again, there's hundreds of examples.
[00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:52.824]  Steve Watson, what do you make of all this?
[00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:58.406]  Then we'll start going step-by-step through the three-part series in the international publication.
[00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.959]  Oh, hello Alex.
[00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.539]  It's good to be back on again.
[00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:27.624]  Yeah, basically, um... Well, if we want to start with what we make of it, then, um... That's pretty clear, I think, from the articles we wrote, but... Basically... Um... It's the... Well... We don't want to tell people what to think, but it's either... It's either clearly a propaganda piece, or it's... Some... Somebody who's... Somehow...
[00:05:28.797 --> 00:05:34.959]  An insider has been able to get this into a major British newspaper.
[00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.660]  But, I mean, we've got to be clear about it.
[00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:40.881]  It's not 1984 by George Orwell.
[00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:42.622]  It's not an artistic masterpiece.
[00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:57.687]  It's basically, to begin with, it was a set of poorly photoshopped images just thrown together of major cities being nuked, basically.
[00:05:58.268 --> 00:06:09.235]  And, um, it's very difficult to understand why that was able to get into a major, one of the biggest newspapers in the world, essentially.
[00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:22.524]  Um, but there's a, there's a series of commenters on the articles who have started to question why we're even questioning it.
[00:06:23.144 --> 00:06:24.945]  Saying, you know, it's good, what's wrong with it?
[00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:26.106]  And saying that it's
[00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:31.889]  It's suspicious that we're even covering it, and even accusing us of being fear-mongering.
[00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.893]  But basically, we're not the ones posting poorly photoshopped images of cities being nuked.
[00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.214]  Well, let's explain.
[00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:41.575]  I mean, I know why they're doing this.
[00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:42.755]  This is done viciously.
[00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:44.997]  We can debate, but I know.
[00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:46.238]  I've studied the enemy.
[00:06:46.978 --> 00:06:48.259]  They want to create panic.
[00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.923]  They want to create fear, so that when they trigger things, people will panic, so they have an excuse to bring in even more control.
[00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:55.624]  That's what they show after the nuke goes off.
[00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:00.485]  Everybody lines the pumps, society breaks down, martial law at the end saves us though.
[00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:07.388]  We go to FEMA camps, North American Union saves us, British Union saves us with the EU, World Government saves us.
[00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.509]  And what did the Wall Street Journal say last week?
[00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.289]  They said the New World Order will save you!
[00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.311]  And they said that that's the only thing that will.
[00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.592]  So they have to introduce this everywhere, so they're doing it.
[00:07:20.772 --> 00:07:21.433]  But just go ahead.
[00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:25.634]  Well yeah, I mean, that's why I believe it to be a
[00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.095]  Propaganda piece.
[00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:37.218]  It's made to look, or it was in the beginning, it was made to look crude on purpose in order to discredit, you know, every issue that was brought up within it.
[00:07:38.098 --> 00:07:55.562]  You know, be that North American Union, be it internment camps, false flag terror, by putting it into the pages of a comic strip or crude photoshopped images, it kind of demeans the subjects, which are, you know, which do need to be
[00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:59.725]  Rationally debated, and they are real agendas.
[00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:02.486]  And which the establishment itself is fear-mongering about.
[00:08:04.227 --> 00:08:04.827]  Well, exactly.
[00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:08.168]  And if you ask yourself, why is this in the Telegraph?
[00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:15.571]  I mean, the majority of Telegraph readers are conservative English people in their 50s or their 60s.
[00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:21.213]  So what are they going to take from a series of crude Photoshop images
[00:08:21.598 --> 00:08:25.921]  Yeah, this is not some cyberpunk comic book shop publication.
[00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:26.902]  Well, exactly.
[00:08:26.922 --> 00:08:28.843]  They're not going to think, oh, this is a warning.
[00:08:28.903 --> 00:08:29.884]  I need to look into this.
[00:08:29.904 --> 00:08:34.367]  They're just going to dismiss every issue in there as, you know, pulp fiction.
[00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:48.256]  But, you know, it's been touted as fiction, you know, but we know that there's agendas to implement domestic police state control.
[00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:54.349]  Well, we'll get to that in a moment, but I just want to add the point now, the addendum here.
[00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.253]  That you're absolutely right.
[00:09:05.313 --> 00:09:15.620]  This is meant, while they're simultaneously in the Financial Times saying, world government's good, we kept it secret from you for your own good, we're taking over, it's dictatorial, you'll have no rights, but we know what's best.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.943]  While all these hundreds of publications are announcing world government, that's the answer to the crisis.
[00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:31.595]  They then are muddying the waters with it in entertainment, and right there in the news pages, to where when you mention it to people, they'll say, oh you got that out of the comics.
[00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:36.537]  So again, this is psych warfare very, very clearly.
[00:09:36.757 --> 00:09:39.099]  But yeah, let's look at who owns the London Telegraph.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.502]  Okay, well, when was the London Telegraph established?
[00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:47.323]  It was established in
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.422]  In the, uh, mid-1800s by British nobility.
[00:09:52.442 --> 00:10:12.292]  It's been owned by... All along the line, it's been owned by Barons, Viscounts, all the way up to Conrad Black, uh, who recently was involved in scandal and then had to sell the telegraph to the Barclay brothers, uh, Frederick and David Barclay, who now own and run the telegraph.
[00:10:13.693 --> 00:10:17.275]  Both regular attendees at Bilderberg meetings, um,
[00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.333]  Basically, they're not going to print anything.
[00:10:20.694 --> 00:10:25.105]  It's not some rag that's going to print a few poorly thrown together.
[00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:28.558]  Images.
[00:10:28.638 --> 00:10:32.700]  And right now we're showing images of the US and England.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.821]  They put millions in concentration camps.
[00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:36.081]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:38.622]  So they're showing everybody what's supposed to happen.
[00:10:38.682 --> 00:10:42.144]  Riot police crush anyone protesting, is aiding terrorists.
[00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:45.505]  They claim that Syria and Iran detonated the nukes.
[00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:48.326]  So the United States and England nuke those nations.
[00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:51.788]  And then at the end of the comic book, the North American Union saves us.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.321]  It says stay at home, await further instructions, emergency transmission.
[00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:04.243]  So they're just preparing the subconscious for when this really happens so that we'll go along with it.
[00:11:04.283 --> 00:11:06.243]  They are map making in the mind.
[00:11:07.644 --> 00:11:07.944]  Steve?
[00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:11.045]  Yeah, I mean, preparing the subconscious, yeah.
[00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:15.826]  That's classic, you know, description of what propaganda is.
[00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:21.228]  If you read Propaganda by Edward Bernays,
[00:11:22.788 --> 00:11:26.689]  Definitive text on it, written in the 20s.
[00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:30.309]  He goes over it in detail.
[00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:31.770]  I can read you some quotes if you'd like.
[00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.590]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.550]  Let's go over it when we get back.
[00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.871]  Folks should go to Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com and read all three of the series.
[00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:45.392]  You can find the latest one posted today and then backtrack with links to the original part one he did on their part one.
[00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:46.732]  And look at it for yourself.
[00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:50.153]  And of course in the real world they're now implementing all of this.
[00:11:50.213 --> 00:11:51.153]  The FEMA camps, everything.
[00:11:51.883 --> 00:11:53.624]  I can't wait to get their hands on your children.
[00:11:54.304 --> 00:11:57.965]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:03.286]  At EnduringRose.com, we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:08.007]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:09.848]  Enduring Rose can help.
[00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:16.350]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.
[00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.811]  These roses, forever preserved in either white or yellow gold, will never wither and never
[00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:22.753]  I think so.
[00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.638]  That's E-N-D-U-R-I-N-G Rose and DuringRose.com or call 702-453-7455.
[00:12:46.658 --> 00:12:47.019]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:59.877]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:13:00.337 --> 00:13:08.099]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:14.021]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:16.316]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:13:16.616 --> 00:13:21.359]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:26.422]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:13:26.922 --> 00:13:30.785]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:13:31.285 --> 00:13:32.286]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:36.448]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:13:36.868 --> 00:13:38.249]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:13:41.764 --> 00:13:44.325]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:47.326]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:48.647 --> 00:13:50.427]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:59.411]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:01.452]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:14:02.423 --> 00:14:03.464]  But who is the enemy?
[00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:04.465]  Bin Laden.
[00:14:04.765 --> 00:14:05.746]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:07.068]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:08.770]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:15.897]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:16.738]  Some U.S.
[00:14:16.778 --> 00:14:22.404]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:14:23.104 --> 00:14:26.607]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:14:26.627 --> 00:14:29.409]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:52.987 --> 00:14:56.628]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:14:56.708 --> 00:15:02.350]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.491]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:09.051]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:15.133]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:15.833]  We're good to go!
[00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.287]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:50.009]  That's 800-387-5516.
[00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:52.370]  Free shipping included.
[00:15:52.390 --> 00:16:01.715]  Alright, in the interest of time, let's go right back to Steve Watson and cut the great music.
[00:16:03.115 --> 00:16:05.356]  I don't think I played it on purpose.
[00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:13.657]  Alright, Steve, you've got the floor.
[00:16:13.697 --> 00:16:15.679]  I can sit here and interrupt all day and make my points.
[00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:21.884]  Go through the propaganda, go through what this series covers, then get into the Bernays' quotes.
[00:16:21.904 --> 00:16:24.486]  We're going to put the... I'm going to give you the floor during this segment.
[00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:25.547]  Just roll with it.
[00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:35.755]  Okay, well let's just go back and go to the start and go through what is actually in Operation Blackjack.
[00:16:36.435 --> 00:16:40.779]  So essentially, it began with Part 1 last month in January.
[00:16:42.203 --> 00:16:47.845]  It was running in the Arts and Culture section of the London Telegraph, one of the biggest newspapers in the world.
[00:16:49.745 --> 00:17:02.788]  The first sort of installment showed pictures of MI5 logos with the date June the 20th and the caption saying MI5 report warns government of imminent terrorist attack.
[00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.630]  So then the date jumps forward to June the 21st, shows a caption of what is
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:19.045]  Apparently a large nuclear device, um, sorry, a small nuclear device loaded into a white van, uh, in the centre of London.
[00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:32.392]  Then it shows people panicking, buying groceries, fleeing the city, and then on, it jumps to June the 22nd, and there's a, an image of a nuclear explosion over the city.
[00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:39.416]  Uh, it then shows various photoshopped, crude images of sort of ruins of famous
[00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:43.586]  London landmarks such as, you know, Big Ben, etc.
[00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:45.266]  Houses of Parliament.
[00:17:45.626 --> 00:17:47.567]  And then that's where Part One ended.
[00:17:47.947 --> 00:17:54.008]  So, you know, wasn't a lot in there to go on to begin with, so very strange.
[00:17:54.048 --> 00:17:55.909]  That's when we started questioning why it was in there.
[00:17:56.549 --> 00:18:00.170]  Part Two comes along about a week later.
[00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:07.812]  It continues the theme, but with images of nukes going off in New York, Washington DC, LA,
[00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:18.593]  Portland, Mexico City, Toronto, and then another series of sort of crumbling remains of these major cities.
[00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:23.975]  So, I mean, it wasn't really even a plot or a storyline.
[00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:35.058]  It was just, at this point, it was just a series of pictures put together on Photoshop, supposed to, you know, depict this situation.
[00:18:36.775 --> 00:19:06.558]  The final image of Part 2 is an important one, because it showed a sort of mock screenshot, I think you've already had it up on the screen there, for the viewers, of an emergency transmission from the Department of Homeland Security, which reads, stay at home and await further instructions, and then it has a sort of, an eagle, and if you've seen pictures of Nazi propaganda and things, and flags, etc, symbolism, it's exactly the same as that, and it's perched on top of a globe.
[00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:09.741]  And underneath are the words, Union of North America.
[00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:18.486]  And then below that, the words, Novus Ordo Seclorum, which translates as New Order of the Ages, or traditionally New World Order.
[00:19:19.706 --> 00:19:28.692]  And then there's also images of British policemen with this kind of, these kind of images on their uniforms and helmets, etc.
[00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:35.055]  And then, part three, kind of, it changed into a comic book style.
[00:19:36.738 --> 00:19:48.087]  So at this point you've got a series of nuclear attacks have gone off to usher in a sort of fascist world government headed by a union of America, UK, Canada and Mexico.
[00:19:48.908 --> 00:20:02.519]  And then it sort of switches to this comic strip which shows a group of men, supposedly officials of this new union, seemingly pleased with
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.501]  God bless you and God bless the Union of North America.
[00:20:08.062 --> 00:20:16.567]  Seemingly pleased with the reports that they're pouring over of casualties and destruction.
[00:20:17.087 --> 00:20:20.269]  And they say, oh, this has exceeded our wildest expectations.
[00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:21.790]  We need to move on to phase two.
[00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:34.217]  So at that point, you're clearly supposed to deduce that these people who are representing a new form of government are somehow involved in the operation related to the attacks.
[00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:59.585]  And then, as we've gone over, the further images show military attacks on Iran, Syria, China, domestic police, state, martial law, concentration camps set up to hold collaborators and dissenters, images of the Amero coin indicating that a new global currency is being created.
[00:21:01.145 --> 00:21:03.946]  And that's where Part 3 ends.
[00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:07.589]  So, who knows if there's going to be a part four.
[00:21:09.271 --> 00:21:14.975]  But if there is a part four, I assume that, you know, this is all going to be there to save everyone.
[00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:21.160]  Well, Steve, I did see some tiles in there where it's like, oh, the panic's over, you know, the economy's back.
[00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:23.382]  I did see one along those lines at the end.
[00:21:24.523 --> 00:21:28.867]  But there's more than just them conditioning our subconscious here.
[00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:32.390]  Psychopaths like to leave tokens.
[00:21:34.318 --> 00:21:37.520]  At their crime scenes, they like to call and taunt the police.
[00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:39.382]  They like to brag!
[00:21:39.482 --> 00:21:42.965]  So, coming from this paper, it's just very chilling.
[00:21:44.186 --> 00:21:45.086]  We're on the march.
[00:21:45.587 --> 00:21:47.168]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:50.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:55.855 --> 00:21:57.756]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:05.348]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:22:05.988 --> 00:22:09.572]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:22:09.993 --> 00:22:13.516]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:22:13.997 --> 00:22:19.002]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement officers.
[00:22:24.326 --> 00:22:24.846]  We're good to go!
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.781]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:55.921 --> 00:22:58.322]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:00.922]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:00.982 --> 00:23:02.143]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:02.163 --> 00:23:03.783]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:06.684]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:23:06.704 --> 00:23:11.586]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFO of our country.
[00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:24.847]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:24.907 --> 00:23:26.028]  An inside job.
[00:23:28.704 --> 00:23:29.804]  How dare you?
[00:23:31.145 --> 00:23:36.206]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:36.226 --> 00:23:38.647]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:38.687 --> 00:23:45.269]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.
[00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:48.170]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.430]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.151]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.267]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:23:55.447 --> 00:23:56.888]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:23:57.188 --> 00:23:59.430]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:04.613]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:24:05.014 --> 00:24:07.855]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:11.678]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:24.072]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:24:24.652 --> 00:24:26.634]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:24:26.654 --> 00:24:27.954]  I use one every day.
[00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:30.836]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:24:31.076 --> 00:24:31.637]  We're good.
[00:24:54.085 --> 00:25:08.770]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:17.832]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:25:17.852 --> 00:25:20.193]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:25:25.632 --> 00:25:37.582]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:25:37.863 --> 00:25:40.065]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:42.667]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:25:44.838 --> 00:25:50.781]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:57.965]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:25:58.065 --> 00:26:03.048]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:26:03.068 --> 00:26:05.949]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:26:06.009 --> 00:26:10.191]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[00:26:10.291 --> 00:26:13.253]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[00:26:14.582 --> 00:26:18.467]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:19.369]  Well, join me.
[00:26:19.889 --> 00:26:22.012]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:26:22.292 --> 00:26:24.095]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:26:25.657 --> 00:26:32.166]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:26:41.155 --> 00:26:42.115]  You know what's amazing?
[00:26:42.135 --> 00:26:46.557]  I look at all these unhappy people who even have jobs, but a lot of folks don't.
[00:26:48.238 --> 00:26:49.498]  And they think life's boring.
[00:26:49.558 --> 00:27:00.703]  We're spinning through the black void of space surrounded by trillions of galaxies, quadrillions of planets, nebulas, black holes.
[00:27:02.363 --> 00:27:08.306]  We're on an incredible sphere with a ribbon of atmosphere and
[00:27:09.557 --> 00:27:12.780]  Huge oceans with all these amazing life forms.
[00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:16.703]  We are these creatures who don't even know our own history.
[00:27:19.045 --> 00:27:20.926]  Who are just now developing technology.
[00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:24.129]  Who knows what we could do in the stars.
[00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:29.173]  And instead we have a bunch of criminals running our system.
[00:27:29.874 --> 00:27:33.117]  And the public is unable to truly dream outside their control paradigm.
[00:27:34.238 --> 00:27:42.522]  And so, are just basically following the manipulations and programming that the establishment uses, punching their primitive buttons.
[00:27:43.802 --> 00:27:50.986]  Now, let us go ahead and go back to Steve Watson.
[00:27:51.026 --> 00:28:02.251]  Steve, I want to cover a few other issues with you, but anything else you want to add about this particular story of this blackjack series in the London Telegraph?
[00:28:04.414 --> 00:28:12.477]  Well, I suppose the other thing to mention is that a lot of readers asking for clarification contacted the Telegraph.
[00:28:13.737 --> 00:28:18.159]  And the overwhelming response from the newspaper itself was a hostile one.
[00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:20.880]  They were belligerent to callers.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.101]  Apparently no one wants to talk about it at the Telegraph.
[00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:32.043]  Readers have been interrogated as to why they care what the piece is supposed to be.
[00:28:32.904 --> 00:28:34.084]  People have hung up on them.
[00:28:35.562 --> 00:28:44.684]  Basically, the paper won't advise, you know... Oh yeah, asking questions or even being able to read now is seen as like out being Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:44.704 --> 00:28:45.284]  I mean, literally.
[00:28:45.744 --> 00:28:50.645]  It's like, you're asking questions, you're taking photos of the police, you're a terrorist.
[00:28:51.325 --> 00:28:53.045]  They're trying that in England now too, aren't they?
[00:28:54.605 --> 00:28:55.366]  Well, exactly.
[00:28:55.446 --> 00:29:03.407]  I mean, the paper just got angry, basically, and wouldn't give an explanation at all as to the content that they're supplying their readers.
[00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:08.045]  So I suppose that's where we are with it really.
[00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:12.347]  I'm sure there'll be more developments.
[00:29:13.568 --> 00:29:23.972]  Some people on other forums claim to have identified who the author is, but I haven't checked that and I don't think there's any direct evidence of that at the moment.
[00:29:24.212 --> 00:29:31.935]  So we're still... That's another thing, normally in an art section they would tell you who the artist was, but the way this is... Well exactly, that's the point of an art section, isn't it?
[00:29:32.936 --> 00:30:01.316]  artists to gain recognition and that's what the readers were concerned about but you know they wouldn't even tell the readers who the artist was so what is the point of the piece that shows everybody going into FEMA camps and nukes going off and the government staging the attacks and setting up a North American Union and merging it with England which which they say the England's actually merged with the North American Union as the Anglo-American establishment airstrip one
[00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:06.535]  Boy, they are nasty.
[00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:12.796]  Normally, when they do stuff like this, and we're seeing a lot of this pop up on TV and shows like Jericho and others, it means they're planning it.
[00:30:14.817 --> 00:30:17.757]  When they nuke, I'm going to have to watch the public run around and worship the government.
[00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:18.657]  It just never ends.
[00:30:19.857 --> 00:30:21.298]  I just want to lose everything, I guess.
[00:30:22.698 --> 00:30:23.058]  Go ahead.
[00:30:23.378 --> 00:30:32.420]  I mean, going back to the propaganda thing, you can see it as an effort to frame the subconscious, because that's what propaganda essentially is.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.620]  That's what Bernays wrote.
[00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:51.366]  It's a mass manipulation, a framing of the world that you live in, and then, you know, creating the appearance that you're, you have free will within that, but you're always trapped within the framed world around you.
[00:30:51.386 --> 00:31:05.193]  It's like, I suppose the best example is the prisoner with Patrick McGoohan who escapes the village, but he's still, you know, he's still within the village because the village has been crafted over
[00:31:05.862 --> 00:31:07.523]  Over centuries, all around us.
[00:31:08.463 --> 00:31:10.204]  And that's essentially what propaganda is.
[00:31:11.264 --> 00:31:13.005]  Bernays wrote Organizing Chaos.
[00:31:15.526 --> 00:31:16.366]  Well, that's it.
[00:31:16.446 --> 00:31:17.246]  I understand.
[00:31:18.027 --> 00:31:18.347]  Go ahead.
[00:31:18.387 --> 00:31:22.328]  This black jacket doesn't seem to be a social commentary.
[00:31:22.348 --> 00:31:23.669]  It's just a cold piece.
[00:31:24.689 --> 00:31:34.613]  And in that sense, it's got the hallmarks of propaganda, of social manipulation, bringing a sort of standard to bear for the masses.
[00:31:37.338 --> 00:31:42.039]  Yeah, it's a flaunting in our face what they may do to us.
[00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:46.520]  But this action itself is a form of terrorism, the threat of violence.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.161]  Well, they know, they've seen the statistics, the polls, the numbers in England, the U.S.
[00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:55.382]  and Europe, where the majority of people believe that the 9-11 was an inside job or that there's a cover-up.
[00:31:55.922 --> 00:31:57.423]  And I think this is a message to us.
[00:31:57.943 --> 00:32:02.204]  The New World Order crowd loves multi-dimensional images.
[00:32:02.284 --> 00:32:05.805]  They love something that has different effects on different classes.
[00:32:06.405 --> 00:32:09.087]  And they see themselves as real artists at this art form.
[00:32:10.067 --> 00:32:12.109]  And so, it's also a threat to everyone.
[00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:13.350]  It's an inside joke to them.
[00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.131]  It further conditions and creates anxiety in the public.
[00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:19.794]  Then when we talk about real government-sponsored terror, they'll say, oh, you saw that in a cartoon.
[00:32:22.575 --> 00:32:26.038]  Yeah, it's always gonna, it's always gonna evolve the propaganda as well.
[00:32:26.418 --> 00:32:30.080]  But I'll read you a quote from Bernays, his sort of end quote in propaganda.
[00:32:30.621 --> 00:32:34.283]  He says, if the public becomes more intelligent in its commercial demands,
[00:32:34.793 --> 00:32:42.114]  Commercial firms will meet the new standards if it becomes aware of the old methods used to persuade it to accept a given idea or commodity.
[00:32:42.534 --> 00:32:45.155]  Its leaders will present their appeals more intelligently.
[00:32:45.675 --> 00:32:47.095]  Propaganda will never die out.
[00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:54.056]  Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring order out of chaos.
[00:32:55.497 --> 00:33:03.938]  So it's always going to be evolving and changing and multi-dimensional levels of it, but in the end it's all about framing the society we live in, we know.
[00:33:05.251 --> 00:33:09.052]  That's, you know, that's what their agenda is, that's what they're about.
[00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:12.313]  These are some sick people.
[00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:18.494]  I mean, these are some really, really sick people.
[00:33:20.335 --> 00:33:32.758]  I mean, but, you know, other people, other readers are saying it may be somebody who's sending a warning, and that's perfectly fine for them to, it's a valid point for them to bring that up, but it's not
[00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:36.416]  Though we can give our opinions, it's not to us to tell them what to think.
[00:33:49.034 --> 00:33:50.775]  In fact, I'm really 100 percent, but I'll just say 90.
[00:33:51.856 --> 00:33:55.077]  And because they didn't put who the artist is, there's a lot of issues here.
[00:33:55.417 --> 00:34:02.041]  See, when you see an article in a newspaper and it doesn't have a name, that automatically means from the editorial board of the paper.
[00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:04.702]  And you'll see articles that don't even say from the editorial board.
[00:34:04.722 --> 00:34:05.522]  It'll just be there.
[00:34:06.463 --> 00:34:08.104]  And this is from the editorial board.
[00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:10.465]  That's the language of a newspaper.
[00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:16.628]  That if it doesn't say who it's from, it's just an article, that is the sense of the paper.
[00:34:18.325 --> 00:34:20.887]  And so in the language of this, that's what we're dealing with.
[00:34:21.647 --> 00:34:23.308]  And people say, well, why are you focusing in on this?
[00:34:23.368 --> 00:34:31.312]  Because so many times, what they put out is what they end up doing.
[00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:40.717]  And people say, oh, the lone government episode of the government flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center to get martial law and, you know, attack Afghanistan and using a drill to make them stand down.
[00:34:41.337 --> 00:34:42.398]  That's just a coincidence.
[00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:51.722]  We happen to have folks from the X-Files, Dean Hagelin, one came to my house, you know, opened the door and it's the TV guy, to say, no, the CIA planted this stuff on us.
[00:34:54.838 --> 00:34:56.502]  This tells us a lot about the globalists.
[00:34:56.522 --> 00:34:58.688]  They're very intelligent, but they're also psychopathic.
[00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.198]  They're very intelligent psychopaths, sadistic psychopaths.
[00:35:03.343 --> 00:35:04.883]  And they're very bored.
[00:35:04.923 --> 00:35:10.145]  This is, you know, what all these aristocrats having too much time on their hands turns into.
[00:35:11.125 --> 00:35:14.345]  And this is what they giggle and snicker about in their little secret meetings.
[00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:17.446]  And they think the revelation of the method is funny.
[00:35:17.846 --> 00:35:25.388]  And they also say they're God, they're the new man, because they can scientifically coldly understand their own human intellect.
[00:35:25.828 --> 00:35:37.936]  And then so they can kill a baby and not feel any emotions, or they can blow up a country and not feel emotions, or they can kill 3,000 people in two towers and not feel anything, and it's only us that are primitive and weak that let our emotions control us.
[00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:38.456]  No!
[00:35:38.476 --> 00:35:40.918]  I am a human being.
[00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:42.359]  I was developed on this planet.
[00:35:42.579 --> 00:35:43.359]  I have children.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.101]  I am a reproductive creature.
[00:35:46.221 --> 00:35:47.382]  I am meant to be nurturative.
[00:35:47.442 --> 00:35:48.563]  I am meant to defend my family.
[00:35:48.603 --> 00:35:49.423]  I am meant to build.
[00:35:49.723 --> 00:35:50.764]  This is who I am.
[00:35:51.144 --> 00:35:52.065]  This is the species.
[00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:53.166]  This is what we are.
[00:35:54.174 --> 00:36:01.129]  And watching what the globalists do, it's a horrible, aberrant form of humanity.
[00:36:05.469 --> 00:36:10.093]  You know, their whole social Darwinistic view, everything they do, it's really just selfishness.
[00:36:10.313 --> 00:36:12.756]  And the proof is, they're holding humanity back.
[00:36:12.796 --> 00:36:18.361]  If they were so slick and so powerful, they wouldn't be trying to poison people and dumb them down so we'd be more manageable.
[00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:27.149]  If they're such God-men, they would be trying to empower everyone and trying to build us to the highest level because they're so much higher than us.
[00:36:30.192 --> 00:36:31.253]  But they've got this sick
[00:36:32.577 --> 00:36:33.398]  Well, exactly, yeah.
[00:36:33.438 --> 00:36:37.640]  If you want to put it a different way, it's a total lack of any sort of spirituality or belief in the rest of the human race, really.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.981]  They want it all, and they want to control it all.
[00:37:04.445 --> 00:37:05.466]  Well, they don't just want it all.
[00:37:05.506 --> 00:37:07.207]  They want to desecrate it all.
[00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:08.268]  They want to mutilate it all.
[00:37:08.288 --> 00:37:10.190]  They want to vandalize it all.
[00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.954]  They want to kill everything beautiful, pull down everything decent.
[00:37:15.815 --> 00:37:19.158]  They boil with hatred at youth and life and goodness.
[00:37:19.978 --> 00:37:29.587]  Because by its very nature, it's a bunch of old, demonic creatures who are totally given over to evil by the choices they've made in life that are in control of it.
[00:37:35.248 --> 00:37:35.568]  I agree.
[00:37:36.749 --> 00:37:37.170]  You agree?
[00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.913]  Yeah.
[00:37:41.894 --> 00:37:43.635]  What's going on over in England?
[00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:45.977]  How's the economy going over there?
[00:37:46.017 --> 00:37:48.539]  I've seen your jobless numbers are about as bad as ours or worse.
[00:37:50.113 --> 00:37:54.818]  Iceland's, the government's fallen, but British banks own Iceland, so people can't even get their money out of the banks.
[00:37:55.538 --> 00:37:57.140]  Europe's in 20% unemployment.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.385]  We're reading about riots all over Europe, but we're being told that the level of the riots is being suppressed.
[00:38:04.126 --> 00:38:06.087]  Your take on Madoff, all of this.
[00:38:07.649 --> 00:38:10.892]  Well, the economy is the same as over there.
[00:38:10.912 --> 00:38:11.712]  It's on its knees.
[00:38:11.732 --> 00:38:16.777]  I mean, basically because we've got the same policies over here, you know.
[00:38:18.021 --> 00:38:28.367]  Bailouts, we had a recent bailout to the tune of, um, well it was a guarantee, the government guaranteeing bank loans to the tune of 200 billion.
[00:38:29.687 --> 00:38:41.354]  Um, all this printing excessive money, they've just, the Bank of England's just dropped rates to the lowest, you know, they've ever been since the, since the initiation of the Bank of England.
[00:38:41.454 --> 00:38:45.196]  So, keeping all the, it's all the same policies that,
[00:38:45.868 --> 00:38:57.677]  You know, your government's got over there, and that's because by proxy, both governments are run by the international bankers and corporations out of London.
[00:38:58.518 --> 00:39:13.930]  So yeah, it's exactly the same over here as it is over there, and while there are some, you know, protests and riots and things over here, they're not getting any sort of mainstream coverage, and they're nowhere near
[00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:17.258]  On as big a scale as they are in Europe at the moment.
[00:39:19.559 --> 00:39:22.820]  But, you know, it remains to be seen whether that will change.
[00:39:25.602 --> 00:39:38.627]  In other news, watching Obama not just go back on every promise, but arrogantly say, we're getting all the CEO pay capped, which then they can selectively put caps on other people, and then all the big CEOs in banking
[00:39:40.846 --> 00:39:41.606]  No, they're not.
[00:39:41.647 --> 00:39:43.487]  To be honest, at the moment, they're still...
[00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:24.674]  I mean, the estimation of what we're getting in our media is still the sort of messianic image of the great new leader, Obama.
[00:40:25.514 --> 00:40:33.617]  There's very little focus on the nightly news, on the actual nuts and bolts of the
[00:40:34.463 --> 00:40:36.424]  Executive orders that he's been issuing.
[00:40:36.864 --> 00:40:41.525]  So it's just all part of ongoing hype to make everybody feel good while the looting is completed?
[00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:43.885]  Yeah, it's still going on.
[00:40:44.166 --> 00:40:48.447]  And I think it'll go on for the foreseeable future.
[00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:54.188]  I mean, you know, there's no investigation of what he's doing already.
[00:40:56.689 --> 00:41:01.370]  It's going to take something significant, I think, for that to change over here.
[00:41:03.612 --> 00:41:09.094]  Well, I love how the mainstream media keeps saying, Obama, you know, he wasn't part of the bailout, that was Bush.
[00:41:09.194 --> 00:41:29.180]  Obama went and cheerleaded for it, they're all together in on it, and Obama's camp followers... I'm just so tired of watching the left-right bait-and-switch over and over again, and that's why we're enslaved, because the public loves to feel like they're important, loves to feel like they've had a hollow victory, instead of a real victory.
[00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:41.273]  Yeah, I mean, the big one was his executive order which protected continuation of CIA renditions.
[00:41:42.493 --> 00:41:53.138]  And, you know, a good, an article I wrote about that a few days ago, good quote in there, was from a British, a British Labour member of the European Parliament.
[00:41:53.818 --> 00:41:58.520]  And the European Parliament was responsible for investigating the renditions and he said,
[00:41:59.943 --> 00:42:05.227]  You know, he directly said you can't criticise Obama because at the moment he's got a god-like status.
[00:42:06.448 --> 00:42:25.864]  Um, you know, he said on the surface it looks like he's closing all his secret prisons and everything, but... You know, people have got to look further into what he's actually... his actual executive orders say, and it says directly in there that he's leaving open the door for, uh...
[00:42:26.894 --> 00:42:33.956]  Both rendition and the continuation of the secret facilities, military facilities, which we know they use for torture.
[00:42:35.296 --> 00:42:40.898]  Steve Watson, I want to appreciate you and the great job you're doing at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:43.019]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[00:42:43.399 --> 00:42:44.319]  Keep up the great work.
[00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:46.079]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:42:46.139 --> 00:42:46.380]  Cheers.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.140]  You bet.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.041]  We'll be back with a ton of news, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[00:42:50.081 --> 00:42:51.281]  We've got an hour and ten minutes left.
[00:42:54.875 --> 00:42:58.158]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:02.403]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:10.551]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:14.012]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:43:14.232 --> 00:43:24.734]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:43:25.014 --> 00:43:33.036]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[00:43:33.216 --> 00:43:40.518]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and freedom of
[00:43:43.715 --> 00:43:48.176]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:43:48.436 --> 00:43:49.817]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:04.116 --> 00:44:05.137]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:05.657 --> 00:44:06.158]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:07.439]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:07.459 --> 00:44:08.760]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.462]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:17.568]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:17.968 --> 00:44:18.409]  Some U.S.
[00:44:18.449 --> 00:44:24.094]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:24.794 --> 00:44:28.275]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:28.295 --> 00:44:31.096]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:00.223]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:45:00.403 --> 00:45:05.566]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:45:05.826 --> 00:45:10.909]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:14.791]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:16.792]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:45:17.113 --> 00:45:23.097]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:45:23.338 --> 00:45:26.880]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.664]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:45:31.944 --> 00:45:32.725]  Do your part.
[00:45:32.985 --> 00:45:35.267]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:45:35.607 --> 00:45:41.732]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink

[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:08.283]  Woah, boom, bop-a-boom Woah, boom, bop-a-boom Woah, boom
[00:46:12.196 --> 00:46:15.437]  Okay, we are back live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:15.537 --> 00:46:20.119]  I'm going to go through the big stack of news and take your phone calls in the next hour.
[00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:20.379]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:20.399 --> 00:46:30.062]  And we'll also play some video clips that I've got coming up.
[00:46:31.242 --> 00:46:34.183]  We got a videotape order in the mail from Germany.
[00:46:34.223 --> 00:46:35.484]  I'm not going to say the guy's name.
[00:46:37.524 --> 00:46:39.165]  This is his first name's Rainer.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.761]  And he sent me a 1923 Weimar Republic Deutsche Mark.
[00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:49.963]  These are the ones they had wheelbarrows to buy a loaf of bread with.
[00:46:51.363 --> 00:46:58.806]  So we'll cut over there to this camera and I'll give folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv a close-up shot of that.
[00:46:58.846 --> 00:47:05.348]  It says that this is a Fiat Mark.
[00:47:07.318 --> 00:47:14.241]  The 1923 mark note from the town of Ogersheim, Scheme, where the former Chancellor Helmut Kohl was born.
[00:47:16.202 --> 00:47:18.863]  And we appreciate the present, we appreciate the gift.
[00:47:18.943 --> 00:47:24.926]  And this one is for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 100,000, 20 million Deutschmarks!
[00:47:24.946 --> 00:47:26.587]  That's 20 million, right?
[00:47:26.607 --> 00:47:28.728]  Yeah, 20 million Deutschmarks.
[00:47:29.848 --> 00:47:30.148]  And you could
[00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:40.773]  Maybe, at one point, maybe a slice of bread with this, maybe if you were lucky.
[00:47:41.614 --> 00:47:45.476]  So that's what could happen to your fiat currency, and that's what they're doing.
[00:47:45.536 --> 00:47:50.820]  As soon as the confidence is lost in the dollar, there's pretty much no way that this isn't going to happen.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.803]  Massive, massive inflation and devaluation of the currency.
[00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:56.524]  Well, they had prettier money than we do.
[00:47:57.565 --> 00:48:01.648]  Even though, this piece of paper, you couldn't, at one point in Germany,
[00:48:03.126 --> 00:48:09.749]  You couldn't buy the paper to print this on for twenty million Deutschmarks.
[00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.731]  To give you an idea of it.
[00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:22.336]  Perhaps we should scan this in and put it up on the web for just the regular radio listeners who aren't watching right now live at PrisonPlanet.tv or when we archive the show.
[00:48:23.396 --> 00:48:24.857]  But I'm staying here going down with the ship.
[00:48:24.897 --> 00:48:28.059]  I'm not running off to our little farm out in the countryside.
[00:48:29.158 --> 00:48:30.378]  Though I think about it every day.
[00:48:31.178 --> 00:48:37.080]  We're actually expanding in the midst of this storm and doing our best because people are tuning in more than ever.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:46.042]  They know we're telling the truth more than ever and folks definitely are concerned and want to get involved in the fight more.
[00:48:46.122 --> 00:48:50.583]  Speaking of sponsors, who makes this radio show possible?
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.341]  Well, it's people like eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:48:54.481 --> 00:49:00.802]  eFoodsDirect.com, that's the website of the longest continually operating storable foods company in the United States.
[00:49:00.842 --> 00:49:05.163]  It's where I get my storable foods, non-GMO, no MSG, no aspartame in it.
[00:49:05.643 --> 00:49:08.764]  eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:13.085]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com and check out their new three-day, one adult food supply for only $21.95.
[00:49:13.125 --> 00:49:13.585]  It's a good sampler.
[00:49:15.245 --> 00:49:33.321]  To check out just a small selection of some of the great storable foods they have that last 10 years in un-climate controlled, more than 10 years in climate controlled conditions, efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633, or again, check them out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:49:34.162 --> 00:49:38.425]  Another sponsor along the same line of preparedness is mysolarbackup.com.
[00:49:39.688 --> 00:49:44.131]  It is designed to provide 800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:51.235]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 1800 power plant, and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:49:51.575 --> 00:49:52.815]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:56.658]  Remember too that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout gas pumps can...
[00:49:57.338 --> 00:50:00.081]  Pump gas, because you can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:03.043]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[00:50:03.364 --> 00:50:05.265]  It's perfect for emergency backup for troubled times.
[00:50:05.726 --> 00:50:07.167]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:50:07.187 --> 00:50:08.749]  That's www.MySolarBackup.com.
[00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:09.509]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:50:09.529 --> 00:50:09.589]  877-327-0365.
[00:50:09.609 --> 00:50:11.331]  The great folks from Solutions from Science.
[00:50:20.239 --> 00:50:31.128]  We're going to come back and take a few phone calls and continue with calls and I've got to go through my giant stack of news I've got disheveled here so that we can go through all the important headlines and information we haven't covered yet.
[00:50:31.508 --> 00:50:32.109]  Stay with us.
[00:50:35.812 --> 00:50:37.373]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:38.314 --> 00:50:40.616]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:43.595 --> 00:50:45.177]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:45.277 --> 00:50:49.903]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:50.043 --> 00:50:52.786]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:53.006 --> 00:50:55.850]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:50:56.050 --> 00:51:00.776]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:00.976 --> 00:51:01.916]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:02.116 --> 00:51:05.038]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:05.358 --> 00:51:12.241]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:15.462]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:15.882]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:18.303 --> 00:51:20.544]  Or, on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:20.764 --> 00:51:26.847]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:27.027 --> 00:51:30.768]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:30.808 --> 00:51:32.289]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.749]  Take action today.
[00:51:32.769 --> 00:51:34.590]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:46.408 --> 00:51:48.289]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:51.510]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:14.366 --> 00:52:19.473]  All right, we are back live here, ladies and gentlemen, and I had a headphone malfunction.
[00:52:19.493 --> 00:52:20.514]  I couldn't fix it in one minute.
[00:52:20.534 --> 00:52:22.196]  The earpiece broke off.
[00:52:22.216 --> 00:52:23.017]  In fact, you know what?
[00:52:23.097 --> 00:52:23.738]  It'll take too long.
[00:52:23.798 --> 00:52:25.921]  I can just do it live on air, under the pressure.
[00:52:25.961 --> 00:52:31.508]  I had about 30 seconds to do it, and I was unable, and if you guys can't, I can just fix it right now on air.
[00:52:31.528 --> 00:52:33.069]  Or they've got more headsets down the hall.
[00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:34.765]  And I can do that.
[00:52:35.265 --> 00:52:39.250]  Doing a live radio show for four hours a day is a lot of fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.393]  Sometimes interesting stuff happens.
[00:52:41.553 --> 00:52:42.975]  You're not able to go to the phone call.
[00:52:42.995 --> 00:52:45.999]  But we'll take a lot of phone calls coming up in this hour.
[00:52:46.679 --> 00:52:51.726]  And there's an important piece of news that I have not gotten to yet.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:53:15.407]  Stabenow, Dems May Hold Talk Radio Accountability Hearings, and it's a clip with her on the radio host Bill Press, formerly of Crossfire, and in this piece, I'm going to play a clip of, she just says, yeah, we want to bring back something like the Fairness Doctrine, the Fairness Doctrine, another Orwellian term.
[00:53:15.827 --> 00:53:21.489]  You know, if they pull troops out of a place, they call it a build-down,
[00:53:23.038 --> 00:53:30.580]  If they're increasing troops, you know they have a different term for it, they call the Patriot Act patriotic.
[00:53:36.402 --> 00:53:46.745]  There's just all sorts of little word manipulations that they engage in, so we're going to be playing that coming up just a little bit later in this radio transmission.
[00:53:47.665 --> 00:53:49.925]  And I guess up next is Patrick in Canada.
[00:53:49.945 --> 00:53:51.526]  Thanks for holding Patrick, you're on the air.
[00:53:53.882 --> 00:53:54.502]  How you doing, brother?
[00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:55.162]  Good, sir.
[00:53:55.202 --> 00:53:55.782]  Thanks for holding.
[00:53:56.283 --> 00:53:56.603]  Good.
[00:53:56.723 --> 00:54:00.323]  I just wanted to let you know of a story that I heard yesterday from one of my customers.
[00:54:00.483 --> 00:54:01.744]  Absolutely made my head shake.
[00:54:02.624 --> 00:54:10.946]  Him and his wife, they were leaving a couple weeks ago to go on a trip to the Caribbean, flying Air Canada, which is basically the largest airline in Canada.
[00:54:11.826 --> 00:54:22.528]  And upon getting to the booth where they basically checked their tickets, the ticket agent told him that due to his name, he was on a terror list and unable to board the plane.
[00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:26.746]  He's got one of those weird names where the first and last name are the same, i.e.
[00:54:26.766 --> 00:54:28.507]  William William type of thing.
[00:54:29.407 --> 00:54:34.069]  And they said that that type of name is very common to use by terrorists.
[00:54:34.689 --> 00:54:40.812]  But what was even more puzzling was that the agent said to him, if you want to sign up for frequent flyer,
[00:54:41.536 --> 00:54:43.518]  We can remove your name from the list.
[00:54:43.939 --> 00:54:44.679]  Yeah, no, no.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.842]  Let me explain this and I'll hold you over if need be.
[00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:49.665]  There's over a million Americans on the no-fly list.
[00:54:49.845 --> 00:54:51.026]  25,000 added a month plus.
[00:54:51.447 --> 00:54:52.488]  England's got 2 million.
[00:54:52.508 --> 00:54:55.511]  You're not gonna be able to own a gun, anything.
[00:54:56.432 --> 00:54:58.334]  And they know with your driver's license number.
[00:54:58.354 --> 00:54:59.976]  They know who you are, where you live.
[00:55:00.016 --> 00:55:01.097]  They know you're not a terrorist.
[00:55:01.818 --> 00:55:05.000]  It's about getting us all used to, oh, I've got to go away with you.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:05.700]  I'm a terrorist.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.901]  Oh, we've got to take you in.
[00:55:06.941 --> 00:55:07.881]  Your name's suspicious.
[00:55:07.901 --> 00:55:08.542]  You're on a list.
[00:55:08.962 --> 00:55:10.262]  It's not just going to be in the airports.
[00:55:10.302 --> 00:55:16.606]  The Pentagon admits it's going to be on the streets, where the troops or the paramilitary police pull you over, and they just grab whoever they want who's on the list.
[00:55:16.626 --> 00:55:17.566]  And it's, well, you're on the list.
[00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:18.447]  This shouldn't be a problem.
[00:55:18.727 --> 00:55:20.448]  And you're used to being on the list so many times.
[00:55:20.468 --> 00:55:23.049]  When they finally take you, you don't fight back.
[00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:25.610]  This is very sadistic, what they're doing.
[00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.712]  And I have heard reports they're doing it, well, they call it trusted traveler.
[00:55:28.732 --> 00:55:30.433]  Well, just sign up with us.
[00:55:31.013 --> 00:55:33.075]  And agree to go through more screening and then you'll be alright.
[00:55:33.095 --> 00:55:33.635]  Is that what he said?
[00:55:33.655 --> 00:55:34.696]  Well, that's it.
[00:55:34.716 --> 00:55:37.018]  But it's like they're rewarding terrorists now.
[00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:39.240]  But it's not terrorism.
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.842]  It's a blacklist.
[00:55:41.202 --> 00:55:43.724]  If somebody was really a suspected terrorist, they should be arrested.
[00:55:44.485 --> 00:55:45.426]  It's total crap.
[00:55:45.486 --> 00:55:46.347]  They're the terrorists.
[00:55:46.367 --> 00:55:47.387]  They carried out the attack.
[00:55:49.209 --> 00:55:49.990]  What else did he say?
[00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:50.690]  What else did he say?
[00:55:51.111 --> 00:55:52.352]  Well, basically that was it.
[00:55:52.472 --> 00:55:55.755]  Him and his wife were harassed to the point where his wife was almost in tears.
[00:55:56.611 --> 00:56:03.594]  And they were in such disbelief that, you know, by subscribing to whatever options they were giving him, that they'd remove his name from the list.
[00:56:03.634 --> 00:56:09.496]  They basically had to cancel their tickets and go and sit and wait five or six hours for another airline to get their trip.
[00:56:10.057 --> 00:56:14.478]  So, just complete manhandling of an individual for no real reason.
[00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:15.599]  No, but that's what it's about!
[00:56:15.719 --> 00:56:19.601]  Going through the checkpoints, being searched, your children being searched at school.
[00:56:19.661 --> 00:56:23.382]  It's about training you to have learned helplessness.
[00:56:24.262 --> 00:56:25.263]  It's an absolute joke.
[00:56:26.795 --> 00:56:27.596]  It's real, man.
[00:56:27.636 --> 00:56:29.097]  These people are building death camps.
[00:56:31.178 --> 00:56:35.061]  How many people does Canadian airports beat to death?
[00:56:35.602 --> 00:56:36.603]  Anything else you want to add, sir?
[00:56:37.203 --> 00:56:37.783]  No, that's it.
[00:56:37.804 --> 00:56:38.684]  I love the show, bro.
[00:56:38.724 --> 00:56:39.225]  Keep it going.
[00:56:39.645 --> 00:56:40.005]  Thank you.
[00:56:40.225 --> 00:56:46.830]  Yeah, for folks that think we're making stuff up, stuff so crazy, I can't even explain how bad it is and how out of control.
[00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:47.251]  Stay with us.
[00:56:53.877 --> 00:57:00.260]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.621]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:57:03.302 --> 00:57:04.322]  But who is the enemy?
[00:57:04.843 --> 00:57:05.363]  Bin Laden.
[00:57:05.643 --> 00:57:06.563]  This is his ammo.
[00:57:06.583 --> 00:57:07.924]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:57:07.984 --> 00:57:09.625]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:10.025 --> 00:57:16.749]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:17.149 --> 00:57:17.589]  Some U.S.
[00:57:17.629 --> 00:57:23.252]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:23.972 --> 00:57:27.453]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:27.473 --> 00:57:29.614]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:57:53.632 --> 00:57:59.358]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[00:57:59.498 --> 00:58:09.348]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[00:58:09.468 --> 00:58:13.833]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[00:58:13.953 --> 00:58:20.920]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, kidneys, computer vision syndrome, and more.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:26.866]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[00:58:26.926 --> 00:58:34.828]  With regular use, people using CAN-C drops report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days, and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[00:58:35.068 --> 00:58:52.894]  CAN-C, that's CAN dash letter C, is available now by calling 888-212-8871, that's 888-212-8871, or order online at Nutrimedical.com, that's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com, your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[00:58:53.843 --> 00:58:57.224]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:58:57.364 --> 00:59:02.586]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:02.766 --> 00:59:07.548]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:07.928 --> 00:59:19.052]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:59:19.452 --> 00:59:24.997]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:59:25.217 --> 00:59:31.283]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:59:31.483 --> 00:59:32.144]  What about you?
[00:59:32.524 --> 00:59:38.570]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[00:59:54.846 --> 00:59:56.948]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:59:56.988 --> 01:00:00.312]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:10.347]  Alright, John, Bradley, Leo, John, Jim and others, your calls are coming up when we come in at the 24 after break.
[01:00:10.387 --> 01:00:13.908]  We're going right through your calls and at the end of the show, I'm going to play this audio.
[01:00:14.348 --> 01:00:23.772]  There's a whole bunch of these, but they are coming after the First Amendment, because that's Al Qaeda too, with the Fairness Doctrine for the web, talk radio, you name it.
[01:00:24.332 --> 01:00:27.113]  They mean business, it's all part of the Violent Radicalization Act.
[01:00:27.973 --> 01:00:30.115]  And a lot more, so you'll hear from a U.S.
[01:00:30.135 --> 01:00:48.628]  Senator coming up, but I've only had him on once, about three or four months ago, and I wanted to get him back on because we've got a lot of questions from listeners out there about how does a box the size of a water cooler without the water bottle on top produce seven and a half gallons of water a day in normal humidity?
[01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:51.212]  It produces water in the desert.
[01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:52.992]  How does that work?
[01:00:53.032 --> 01:01:04.578]  So we have the founder of A Cola Blue, the designer, and he is also, of course, the individual who we have on air with us.
[01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:07.019]  So he's perfect to be able to discuss all these things.
[01:01:07.579 --> 01:01:09.020]  And he's Tyler Palmer.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.221]  Tyler, I appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:15.122]  Well, thank you, Alex, and I appreciate being able to come on again.
[01:01:15.263 --> 01:01:17.624]  It was a pleasure talking to you the last time.
[01:01:19.745 --> 01:01:25.150]  Again, it's wonderful to be able to explain the technology to all the people listening.
[01:01:26.147 --> 01:01:32.630]  Okay, break down how an atmospheric water generator works, and then it also has filters in it after it grabs the water out of the air.
[01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:43.334]  I know the media has said that carbon dioxide that makes up most of water and water vapors is toxic waste, but I mean, you know, the clouds are the water, and there is water in the air.
[01:01:44.155 --> 01:01:45.175]  It's not with al-Qaeda.
[01:01:45.555 --> 01:01:53.178]  I know they want to put a tax on it, but explain to us how you grab this al-Qaeda out of the atmosphere so people can drink it.
[01:01:55.297 --> 01:02:08.429]  If anyone's ever sat and enjoyed a cold drink on a hot day, they've probably noticed that maybe their wives or girlfriends will say to you, use a coaster, you know, put the coaster below the drink.
[01:02:08.949 --> 01:02:11.211]  You mean enjoying a cold glass of al-Qaeda?
[01:02:11.772 --> 01:02:20.599]  Right, a cold glass of al-Qaeda, because on the exterior of the glass, there's moisture that's condensing, and that moisture
[01:02:21.986 --> 01:02:25.409]  Is the ambient moisture that's in all air.
[01:02:25.429 --> 01:02:33.736]  It doesn't matter if it's the desert or if it's in the polar, in the northern polar regions, there's moisture in the air.
[01:02:34.537 --> 01:02:50.030]  And our machine condenses that water vapor and filters that condensate and makes it potable drinking water that you can have at your home and control.
[01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:57.629]  Uh, so that, uh, you know, here in California, where I am, we now have mandatory rationing.
[01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:59.250]  And toilet to tap.
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:08.316]  Most of your big facilities, they take the sewage and then supposedly clean it up with all sorts of nice chemicals that are worse than drinking the poop, and then feed it back to you.
[01:03:08.356 --> 01:03:10.237]  But again, that's good water.
[01:03:10.317 --> 01:03:11.898]  Water out of the air is al-Qaeda water.
[01:03:12.358 --> 01:03:17.303]  And we know that they are trying to restrict and ban and tax people with their own wells now.
[01:03:18.043 --> 01:03:22.707]  I guess you could hide one of these Acola Blues and land in the free home of the brave in your house, even if they outlawed it.
[01:03:23.228 --> 01:03:24.789]  Get a little bit of the water out of the air.
[01:03:24.809 --> 01:03:25.770]  I mean, maybe.
[01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:38.241]  No, we have plenty of people in apartments and in rural areas who use the machines and they get all their drinking water needs met by
[01:03:39.195 --> 01:03:43.158]  This one little device that's about the size of a water cooler, like you said.
[01:03:43.578 --> 01:03:47.161]  And if you plug it into a solar panel, you've got it right, I mean, you can be off the grid.
[01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:57.749]  Right, you can be off the grid in all ways, you know, in terms of electricity, if you have solar, and then now with water, you can be off the grid.
[01:03:57.829 --> 01:04:01.952]  So, you can be your own independent Al-Qaeda production unit.
[01:04:02.492 --> 01:04:03.053]  Yeah, I know.
[01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:04.494]  This is kind of terroristic.
[01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:09.278]  Having a garden, having a water purification on the air, having your own power.
[01:04:09.338 --> 01:04:12.421]  That could be... You could do some crimes with power.
[01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:14.042]  You could electrocute somebody.
[01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:17.545]  Just like they want to register guns for everybody's safety.
[01:04:17.565 --> 01:04:18.986]  Because, you know, guns are what are evil.
[01:04:19.006 --> 01:04:19.907]  Well, electricity is evil.
[01:04:20.187 --> 01:04:24.111]  You could put wires in the wall and run outside with wires and shock somebody.
[01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:25.392]  So we've got to ban electricity.
[01:04:25.672 --> 01:04:26.473]  Right.
[01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:31.837]  Well, water will soon be evil, too, if it's not delivered by the municipality.
[01:04:32.217 --> 01:04:33.578]  What do you mean, soon?
[01:04:33.618 --> 01:04:38.202]  I mean, to be serious, there's ads everywhere demonizing bottled water, saying, drink your tap, it's healthy.
[01:04:38.422 --> 01:04:43.406]  There's ads telling us the mercury-filled, literally mercury-filled, high fructose corn syrup is wonderful.
[01:04:43.766 --> 01:04:46.848]  There's ads telling us, I mean, so yeah, no, no, we need to get off the grid.
[01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:51.572]  Yeah, and our technology and our company
[01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:56.612]  Really wants to help people to be off the grid and be self-sufficient.
[01:04:57.032 --> 01:05:11.955]  And we see this, like, in addition to having your own garden, your own firearms, and your own energy source, your own water now.
[01:05:12.555 --> 01:05:15.356]  It completes the cycle.
[01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.177]  Of course, storable food is important.
[01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.271]  Right.
[01:05:21.398 --> 01:05:22.183]  If you have water...
[01:05:23.729 --> 01:05:27.672]  You know, you can go on for an indefinite period.
[01:05:27.852 --> 01:05:28.732]  We can't have that.
[01:05:28.752 --> 01:05:31.314]  I mean, you could commit a crime if you have enough water to drink.
[01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:32.114]  Right.
[01:05:32.435 --> 01:05:34.196]  You've got to only have the government give it to you.
[01:05:34.276 --> 01:05:36.477]  If you've been good, you'll be in a little pit cage.
[01:05:36.877 --> 01:05:38.498]  And if you've been good like a monkey, they'll feed you.
[01:05:38.538 --> 01:05:39.579]  I mean, let's get serious, though.
[01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:43.041]  It is important to get off the grid, but more importantly, this produces a lot of water.
[01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:44.782]  Even in the desert, a lot of water.
[01:05:44.802 --> 01:05:47.344]  You have bigger units for people that have larger needs.
[01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:48.424]  Very affordable.
[01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.467]  And the great part is, it goes through all these other filtration systems inside.
[01:05:53.129 --> 01:05:53.429]  Right.
[01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:57.511]  We have several different filtration systems.
[01:05:58.792 --> 01:06:04.855]  Chief amongst them is the activated carbon that is impregnated with silver.
[01:06:05.976 --> 01:06:11.879]  And as many people know, silver is a natural antimicrobial... Wait a minute!
[01:06:11.919 --> 01:06:12.479]  Impregnated?
[01:06:12.499 --> 01:06:13.840]  There's too many people on the planet!
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.221]  That's another climate crime!
[01:06:16.892 --> 01:06:18.773]  Well, it's a chemical term.
[01:06:19.474 --> 01:06:23.577]  No, I understand, but it's a joke.
[01:06:23.757 --> 01:06:44.773]  So we have the activated carbon filters, and then we also have UV lights in the system, 245 nanometer UV lights, which are, in a sense, it completely, if there's any bacteria in there, let's say it's RNA is
[01:06:45.816 --> 01:06:53.059]  Stopped from reproducing and it just wipes out all the bacteria that could be in the water.
[01:06:53.279 --> 01:06:53.739]  I don't know.
[01:06:54.119 --> 01:07:02.963]  I think I'm going to drink big healthy glasses of municipal tap water full of mercury, lead, arsenic, chlorine, sodium, fluoride, and then all the dead bacteria just kills us.
[01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:05.224]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:07:05.244 --> 01:07:07.885]  Why are you an extremist?
[01:07:07.925 --> 01:07:09.806]  Toilets are tapped in many major cities.
[01:07:09.866 --> 01:07:12.827]  Drinking sewage water that's been burned with chemicals.
[01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:15.148]  That sounds delicious.
[01:07:15.268 --> 01:07:19.411]  Sir, do you have some kind of authority problem?
[01:07:19.431 --> 01:07:28.297]  They've got mental illness designations now for people that think they need to be self-sufficient and people that don't trust the government or don't trust toilet water?
[01:07:28.897 --> 01:07:29.538]  Sewage?
[01:07:29.658 --> 01:07:31.039]  You don't want reclaimed sewage?
[01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:33.381]  Well, yeah.
[01:07:33.981 --> 01:07:38.424]  I may be anti-establishment and have trouble with authority, but
[01:07:38.928 --> 01:07:40.910]  I just don't like the taste of sewage.
[01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.614]  I mean, call me crazy, but... Well, you know what?
[01:07:44.654 --> 01:07:45.856]  I'm going to keep drinking sewage water.
[01:07:45.876 --> 01:07:49.059]  I don't think people should call and get a... No, getting serious.
[01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:50.140]  This is awesome, folks.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:50.781]  This is awesome.
[01:07:50.821 --> 01:07:51.762]  I've got one at my house.
[01:07:52.523 --> 01:07:53.424]  My friends have been getting it.
[01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:54.845]  We've got one at the office here.
[01:07:55.786 --> 01:07:57.207]  You need to get into Cola Blue.
[01:07:57.527 --> 01:07:59.169]  You won't believe how great these units are.
[01:07:59.189 --> 01:08:00.630]  You've got them in a bunch of different colors.
[01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.333]  I've got a black one here at the office, a black one at home, and we've got another green one.
[01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:08.456]  Let's give people a website.
[01:08:08.476 --> 01:08:12.379]  It's acolablue.com.
[01:08:12.399 --> 01:08:13.279]  What about a phone number?
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.362]  The phone number is 800-691-6043, and we have a new call center.
[01:08:23.295 --> 01:08:35.549]  There's some folks there, Charmaine, Jim, Tim, Travis, and Roy, who will take your phone call, and then after hours we have our other number, the 866-585-4044 number.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:46.006]  But if you want to speak to us in the office, that 800-691-6043 number is the way to do it.
[01:08:46.086 --> 01:08:49.089]  And you've got brochures and material.
[01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:52.432]  You've got a bunch of other products, too, on the Ecolablue website.
[01:08:52.552 --> 01:08:54.474]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:08:54.954 --> 01:08:57.436]  And all silliness aside, this is a great unit.
[01:08:58.497 --> 01:09:01.861]  There's some other stuff out there, but this is the best one we've found, especially for the price.
[01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:03.142]  Gorgeous unit.
[01:09:03.662 --> 01:09:09.165]  And it's high-tech, I mean, everything's controlled there, and you've got hot water that comes out of it, too.
[01:09:09.426 --> 01:09:10.947]  Tell folks about the control panel.
[01:09:11.527 --> 01:09:26.856]  Right, it really is state-of-the-art, and it comes in, to follow up on the colors, we have gray, black, well, silver, black, red, green, and white, and a blue one.
[01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:32.980]  And the LCD screen, it has a little computer on it,
[01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:37.501]  And it monitors the temperature of the hot and cold water tank.
[01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:39.282]  There are two separate tanks on there.
[01:09:39.922 --> 01:09:45.865]  The hot water tank will heat the water up to 199 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:09:46.605 --> 01:09:50.447]  And it'll heat it as little as 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:09:50.948 --> 01:09:55.790]  And then the cold water side will chill it to 39 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:09:56.288 --> 01:09:56.609]  I think so.
[01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:13.228]  To have hot water when you need it and cold water.
[01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:19.934]  All other water, even if we put it through a filter, which is still good, comes downstream through all the cities and towns, the runoff.
[01:10:20.294 --> 01:10:23.958]  When you're getting it out of the air, it's about as clean as it gets and then it goes through filters.
[01:10:24.258 --> 01:10:26.000]  You cannot beat this water.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:26.060]  800-691-6043.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.120]  800-691-6043.
[01:10:31.264 --> 01:10:31.784]  That's correct.
[01:10:31.824 --> 01:10:37.946]  And also, I'd like to tell your listeners, and this is just for Alex Jones listeners, we're going to offer any color machine
[01:10:55.288 --> 01:11:01.992]  Of the Ecolo Blue Model 28 for $1,250 with free shipping.
[01:11:02.612 --> 01:11:05.914]  And that's all the way up until Valentine's Day.
[01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:07.135]  So what is that?
[01:11:07.155 --> 01:11:09.716]  $300 off the price and then free shipping is like a $100 value?

[01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:18.921]  $800, $691, $60, $43.
[01:11:19.522 --> 01:11:21.843]  And what about Alex Jones listeners going to Colorblue.com?

[01:12:35.744 --> 01:12:36.904]  And we knew what to do.
[01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.111]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:13:03.332 --> 01:13:09.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.

[01:13:26.386 --> 01:13:29.428]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:13:29.548 --> 01:13:34.691]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[01:16:10.349 --> 01:16:13.150]  Alright, right back to your calls, and then to the attack on the First Amendment.
[01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:14.151]  It's really happening.
[01:16:14.911 --> 01:16:18.113]  They swore they wouldn't do it, but of course they're moving ahead with the legislation.
[01:16:18.653 --> 01:16:20.674]  They are a nasty group of little creatures.
[01:16:21.614 --> 01:16:25.516]  Let's talk to Aaron in California, then Peter, Bradley, Leo, Jim, and others.
[01:16:25.656 --> 01:16:27.617]  Aaron, you are on the air, sir.
[01:16:28.764 --> 01:16:29.744]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:30.705]  I love your show.
[01:16:30.765 --> 01:16:33.486]  I'm a paid member, and you're an inspiration to true seekers everywhere.
[01:16:33.746 --> 01:16:35.967]  Couldn't do it without the PresentPlanet.tv members.
[01:16:35.987 --> 01:16:36.327]  Thank you.
[01:16:37.488 --> 01:16:39.608]  And I just wanted to throw out a real quick YouTube plug.
[01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.670]  Two channels, not so much 524 and Here in the Light of Day.
[01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:47.972]  You know, we gather up videos and everything from all across the internet, and piece them all together for everybody to watch.
[01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:49.712]  Excellent.
[01:16:50.953 --> 01:16:55.895]  But what I really wanted to talk to you about was more local posse comitatus violations.
[01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:03.191]  I'm sorry, you're out in California where the Marines run checkpoints with the police for DWIs.
[01:17:03.231 --> 01:17:04.592]  Go ahead.
[01:17:04.832 --> 01:17:13.715]  Actually, I am in the Monterey Bay area and what we have going on here is supposedly from what the police and the mainstream media tell us is that it's a gang war.
[01:17:14.455 --> 01:17:18.537]  Well, our mayor has been completely ineffectual in trying to combat this.
[01:17:18.617 --> 01:17:22.038]  He's tried to organize fasts and other
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:26.943]  Real new age type stuff to help, you know, gather awareness in the community.
[01:17:27.303 --> 01:17:30.005]  But the only thing that's happened is just made crime worse around here.
[01:17:31.806 --> 01:17:35.869]  Well, society's imploding and as the economy goes to hell in a handbasket, it's only going to get worse.
[01:17:35.929 --> 01:17:38.591]  And they've made shoot-em-ups the culture.
[01:17:39.712 --> 01:17:43.654]  There's a... Well, I mean, keep talking about it.
[01:17:43.674 --> 01:17:44.935]  Go ahead and talk about Posse Comitatus.
[01:17:44.975 --> 01:17:45.756]  I'm finding a clip.
[01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:49.018]  They just did big urban warfare drills again with black helicopters.
[01:17:49.058 --> 01:17:51.099]  Mainstream news in Louisiana.
[01:17:51.139 --> 01:17:51.440]  Go ahead.
[01:17:52.641 --> 01:18:05.647]  Yeah, what's the kicker though is that now the mayor has gotten the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey involved in searching for evidence and gathering new strategies to help combat this so-called gang war problem.
[01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:08.788]  Well, that's what Governor Blagojevich said three or four months ago before he got into all this trouble.
[01:18:08.808 --> 01:18:12.209]  He said, we're going to use the National Guard to help us get the guns off the streets.
[01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:16.291]  So, again, who specifically in the military?
[01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:18.432]  The Naval Postgraduate School.
[01:18:20.464 --> 01:18:22.845]  Naval postgraduate school.
[01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:25.446]  Yeah, well, I mean, this is the way to introduce it to the public.
[01:18:25.766 --> 01:18:34.929]  Through the threat integration centers, the FEMA centers, and this is announced, by the way, in the FEMA camp bill, they're going to have military, police, everybody together, quote, just helping.
[01:18:34.969 --> 01:18:35.889]  Well, we're just helping.
[01:18:36.309 --> 01:18:37.870]  The Army's just here at a car wreck.
[01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:38.850]  They say that.
[01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:41.251]  You're against the Army helping at a car wreck?
[01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:44.252]  But again, it's to sell the idea and set the precedent.
[01:18:45.332 --> 01:18:45.813]  Exactly.
[01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:49.854]  And I mean, that's the thing that kills me most about these, you know, the citizens around here in this town.
[01:18:50.282 --> 01:18:54.624]  Everybody just, you know, there are more sheep out there bleeding Obama!
[01:18:55.085 --> 01:18:56.966]  Obama!
[01:18:57.446 --> 01:18:58.967]  Obama!
[01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:01.748]  But wait, he said the torture continues, a secret arrest!
[01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:02.969]  No liar!
[01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:06.031]  But wait, he's actually for the banker bailout!
[01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:07.131]  No!
[01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:07.912]  Bush did it!
[01:19:08.632 --> 01:19:10.153]  Well, yes, they both did it, they're both together!
[01:19:10.233 --> 01:19:11.094]  No!
[01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:13.215]  Well, he's actually briefing up troops in the Middle East!
[01:19:13.495 --> 01:19:14.695]  No!
[01:19:14.976 --> 01:19:17.597]  Well, he's appointing all these criminals from the banks who don't pay taxes!
[01:19:17.897 --> 01:19:18.177]  No!
[01:19:20.504 --> 01:19:22.025]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:22.085 --> 01:19:22.945]  No, that's fine.
[01:19:22.965 --> 01:19:24.165]  That was actually great.
[01:19:24.785 --> 01:19:32.848]  Basically, what I'm trying to do now here in my community is really raise the constitutional awareness of what's going on with these events.
[01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:34.769]  This is a precursor to martial law.
[01:19:36.509 --> 01:19:38.290]  Well, we're already under martial law.
[01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:42.271]  It's physical martial law on the ground, another degree in the Richter scale.
[01:19:43.767 --> 01:19:44.707]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:19:44.727 --> 01:19:45.687]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:49.228]  In fact, speaking of the devil, Paul Watson did an article based on mainstream reports.
[01:19:49.328 --> 01:19:49.508]  U.S.
[01:19:49.528 --> 01:19:52.249]  troops and black helicopters invaded New Orleans, dropped bombs.
[01:19:52.529 --> 01:20:00.170]  This has happened so many thousands of times around the country that now I don't even cover it when I used to run around hiding in the bushes to videotape it and people would deny it was going on.
[01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:01.650]  Go to InfoWars, guys.
[01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:08.992]  It's the bottom story in News in Focus, the bottom story in Featured Stories, and I want to put that up on the screen.
[01:20:09.032 --> 01:20:09.772]  Anything else?
[01:20:09.812 --> 01:20:11.232]  So what's the public think about having
[01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:12.846]  The Navy there.
[01:20:12.866 --> 01:20:14.647]  You know, the Navy's creating its own private army now.
[01:20:15.908 --> 01:20:16.629]  You know, that's right.
[01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:23.834]  And, you know, the Defense Language Institute and the Naval Postgraduate School, you know, they're one of the premier anti-terrorism facilities in the military today.
[01:20:24.074 --> 01:20:30.139]  Well, the Monterey Bay facility trained the terrorists, and their own head of it came out and said that.
[01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:31.160]  That's right, exactly.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.381]  Colonel Butler.
[01:20:34.703 --> 01:20:37.345]  But who cares about Colonel Butler when you can say Obama?
[01:20:41.752 --> 01:20:46.474]  You know, it's really funny, too, because I'm actually a former service member myself.
[01:20:46.574 --> 01:20:57.077]  I was in the Navy for a few years, and now that I'm out and I've been woken up and I see everything that's going on, I'm really glad that I'm not in the military anymore.
[01:20:57.677 --> 01:20:59.938]  It's just against everything I believe in, what they're doing now.
[01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:00.798]  It's horrible.
[01:21:01.279 --> 01:21:04.920]  Well, you know, they're running these TV ads where they equate the new military with George Washington.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.101]  George Washington was fighting what our military has become.
[01:21:09.016 --> 01:21:09.136]  Right.
[01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:11.777]  And so it's not our military anymore, it's not our government anymore.
[01:21:12.157 --> 01:21:15.458]  And I'm just sad that good men and women are joining it, because they're going to be used.
[01:21:15.498 --> 01:21:17.438]  Go ahead.
[01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:27.261]  Just to kind of parallel what you said right there, you know, our mayor now, with this whole gang war and this, you know, exponential increase in violence, you know, he's equating it to a low-grade 9-11.
[01:21:27.681 --> 01:21:30.502]  And, you know, that just, that curdled my blood when I heard that.
[01:21:30.976 --> 01:21:32.037]  Oh, everything's a 9-11.
[01:21:32.057 --> 01:21:34.319]  The financial collapse, they engineered the 9-11.
[01:21:34.779 --> 01:21:37.662]  And yeah, the crime rate's just gonna explode, they're gonna come with the gun control.
[01:21:37.962 --> 01:21:40.905]  Get ready, the bills are introduced, they're coming for your guns, we'll be right back.
[01:21:43.867 --> 01:21:46.870]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:50.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:54.877 --> 01:21:55.958]  Hi, this is Steve Shane.
[01:22:00.907 --> 01:22:11.015]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[01:22:53.689 --> 01:23:00.091]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:00.451 --> 01:23:02.431]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:03.091 --> 01:23:04.111]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:04.652 --> 01:23:05.152]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:05.432 --> 01:23:06.352]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:06.372 --> 01:23:07.752]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:07.812 --> 01:23:09.473]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:09.813 --> 01:23:16.554]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:16.954 --> 01:23:17.395]  Some U.S.
[01:23:17.435 --> 01:23:23.076]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:23.776 --> 01:23:27.317]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:27.657 --> 01:23:37.520]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.500]  Fabled enemies.

[01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.200]  Garden in a can!

[01:25:04.006 --> 01:25:07.049]  Oh, here I come now, baby!
[01:25:09.491 --> 01:25:12.693]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby!
[01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:14.415]  Come on, come on, come on!
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.421]  You know, I feel good about my life.
[01:25:21.441 --> 01:25:27.125]  Whatever happens in all of this, whatever happens to all you great folks out there that hate tyranny and love liberty, at least we know we're fighting hard.
[01:25:27.566 --> 01:25:28.426]  At least we know we're right.
[01:25:29.622 --> 01:25:33.344]  The guys were just talking about Obama last night in a big rampaging, ranting speech.
[01:25:33.804 --> 01:25:37.686]  I saw part of it in and back and forth in the editing room as we're working on the Obama film.
[01:25:38.247 --> 01:25:40.148]  And he was just saying, what do you think a stimulus is?
[01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:43.509]  And everybody's like standing ovations and actually he's getting all heated and angry.
[01:25:43.549 --> 01:25:45.390]  And I just love the American people so much.
[01:25:45.751 --> 01:25:48.832]  If we don't turn this around, it's going to be a catastrophe.
[01:25:49.372 --> 01:25:53.695]  And people are just like, oh, he cares so much because they're going to, they're killing the economy.
[01:25:53.755 --> 01:25:55.376]  Not Obama, people that run things.
[01:25:55.936 --> 01:25:56.736]  Bush didn't run things.
[01:25:56.756 --> 01:25:57.737]  Get past the puppet.
[01:25:58.197 --> 01:26:05.882]  We've got a graphic in the film where it's Obama's face and you zoom right into his eye and you go behind that and it's the Bilderberg Group and the New World Order.
[01:26:07.123 --> 01:26:14.008]  We've got another one where the curtains part and they pull Bush aside and put Obama in and behind the next curtain is the New World Order.
[01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:18.691]  So he's like, I care so much about you, I'm so mad at these bankers!
[01:26:18.751 --> 01:26:22.894]  And meanwhile he's bankrolled by all of them and he isn't putting salary caps on them and it's all bull.
[01:26:24.842 --> 01:26:27.844]  Oh, man, it is just insane to see all of this going.
[01:26:27.924 --> 01:26:29.925]  Oh, I'm so concerned about you.
[01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:32.006]  Oh, I just care about you so much.
[01:26:32.246 --> 01:26:43.572]  Oh, I'm just gonna... I mean, compare this great acting and this slickness, and he's smart and everything, compared to Bush, I mean, yes, but Bush was a puppet, too, and I know I keep saying that.
[01:26:43.992 --> 01:26:45.313]  I know you, the listeners, know that.
[01:26:45.793 --> 01:26:47.294]  What about the general public?
[01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:48.775]  How do we reach out to these people?
[01:26:48.975 --> 01:26:50.976]  Here's Paul Watson's story, then I'm going back to your calls.
[01:26:51.316 --> 01:26:51.516]  U.S.
[01:26:51.556 --> 01:26:52.077]  troops and black
[01:26:52.697 --> 01:26:55.658]  Helicopters invade New Orleans, drop bombs.
[01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:57.158]  That's right.
[01:26:58.398 --> 01:26:59.698]  All the years this didn't exist.
[01:26:59.718 --> 01:27:07.260]  They'd do terror drills and not announce it to the media and then there'd be smoking buildings and the media would say, did not happen, it's all lies, the public's insane.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.201]  That was a PSYOP, covered in my police state films.
[01:27:11.041 --> 01:27:12.721]  But now it just goes into all of it.
[01:27:16.502 --> 01:27:17.162]  Oh my goodness.
[01:27:19.261 --> 01:27:22.483]  Well, anyways, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[01:27:23.343 --> 01:27:26.104]  Let us go back to your phone calls, because I want to get into the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:27:26.464 --> 01:27:29.346]  Peter in PA, you are on the air, sir.
[01:27:30.266 --> 01:27:31.086]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:31.367 --> 01:27:32.487]  Long time listener.
[01:27:32.527 --> 01:27:34.268]  Started as a young buck on the shortwave.
[01:27:34.288 --> 01:27:35.328]  Just want to say thank you.
[01:27:35.829 --> 01:27:36.949]  I salute you, Peter.
[01:27:37.009 --> 01:27:37.409]  What's up?
[01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:38.350]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:40.531]  Well, a couple things I'd like to address real quick.
[01:27:40.571 --> 01:27:42.552]  I wonder if anybody notices that
[01:27:44.019 --> 01:27:50.103]  I don't know if it's a civil war that's brewing or what, I mean, with the eight states and Vermont looking to succeed.
[01:27:50.844 --> 01:27:56.767]  I don't think anybody's even noticed the similarities between Barack Obama and Abe Lincoln, the civil war.
[01:27:56.787 --> 01:27:57.748]  No, no, no, he knows!
[01:27:58.128 --> 01:28:00.890]  Listen, listen, they've got psych warfare war games.
[01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:02.851]  The Pentagon admits of how society will break down.
[01:28:03.232 --> 01:28:04.833]  The first place I read about the U.S.
[01:28:04.853 --> 01:28:12.618]  breaking up was ten years ago in a Pentagon prospectus saying they believed it was going to happen, but they want to break us up so the globalists can take us over into the Union.
[01:28:13.343 --> 01:28:15.005]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[01:28:15.045 --> 01:28:17.528]  That was my next step.
[01:28:17.568 --> 01:28:18.829]  Let me tell you, this is too important.
[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:21.352]  Look, Kurt Nimmo did an article on this yesterday.
[01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:27.439]  They know, after federalizing things and bankrupting the states by design, that things are going to fall apart.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.602]  We're talking insane times we're going into, folks.
[01:28:30.622 --> 01:28:34.066]  Almost no way to avert it, because they're honchoing it, making sure it's happening.
[01:28:36.237 --> 01:28:42.882]  What you have to understand is that they understand the people are going to revolt at the state level and try to bring in liberty.
[01:28:42.922 --> 01:28:54.912]  They know the people are going to demand that Madoff and the rest of them actually be punished, and so that's what NORTHCOM does is actually block the states, and then they're comparing Lincoln and everything that happened with what Obama's going to do.
[01:28:54.932 --> 01:28:59.575]  So when he says, I'm going to be like Lincoln, he means that he's going to have the feds occupy everything.
[01:28:59.615 --> 01:29:00.676]  But absolutely.
[01:29:01.117 --> 01:29:02.157]  It's all scripted.
[01:29:02.197 --> 01:29:02.538]  Go ahead.
[01:29:03.326 --> 01:29:06.429]  Oh, I mean, on that topic, just quickly, I want to touch on that.
[01:29:06.449 --> 01:29:07.190]  I have a good buddy.
[01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:08.551]  I'm going to call him the Rebazor.
[01:29:10.152 --> 01:29:11.093]  He was in the military.
[01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:14.556]  He is so fed up that he's ready to hit Montana with his guns.
[01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:21.643]  But, I mean, what I'm saying, as far as that goes, is people look at Lincoln like Lincoln was a good president.
[01:29:22.163 --> 01:29:22.463]  Okay?
[01:29:22.543 --> 01:29:24.005]  Habeas Corpus, gone.
[01:29:24.645 --> 01:29:25.026]  Camp.
[01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:27.188]  Let's explain what happened, for those that don't know.
[01:29:28.468 --> 01:29:30.809]  And I've read the writings of Lincoln, I've studied it.
[01:29:31.049 --> 01:29:34.190]  Lincoln wasn't bad, the South wasn't bad.
[01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:35.451]  Now let me explain what happened.
[01:29:35.471 --> 01:29:41.453]  This is mainline history, but it's not taught in school, but in real scholarly history books it's admitted.
[01:29:41.493 --> 01:29:46.955]  Now listen, the British had lost the war in the 1780s, started in 1776.
[01:29:49.036 --> 01:29:52.697]  They came in through their agent, Alexander Hamilton,
[01:29:54.411 --> 01:29:55.953]  Uh, who Mr. Burr then killed.
[01:29:55.973 --> 01:29:57.254]  They said, step outside.
[01:29:57.294 --> 01:29:58.795]  Back then, they said, step outside, punk.
[01:29:58.815 --> 01:30:00.096]  They went out and shot, you know, and killed him.
[01:30:00.797 --> 01:30:01.458]  Uh, in a duel.
[01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:07.023]  And he wanted to make George Washington king, he wanted to set up a new banking elite, and they were making deals with the British on the side.
[01:30:07.783 --> 01:30:08.744]  They, they killed him.
[01:30:08.984 --> 01:30:13.368]  Then they tried with the British, by the turn of the century, 1800, to overthrow the U.S.
[01:30:13.609 --> 01:30:16.912]  There were rebellions, armies marched on the Capitol.
[01:30:17.791 --> 01:30:18.131]  Okay?
[01:30:18.732 --> 01:30:20.352]  Then Andrew Jackson came up later.
[01:30:20.412 --> 01:30:23.374]  Love him or hate him, the point is, he routed the British banks out.
[01:30:24.134 --> 01:30:38.081]  The British banks, he gave speeches, the British banks went into South Carolina, Georgia, and they said, the North's got taxes on you, let's have a rebellion and split off, and Britain will let you have the entire South, and then into the West.
[01:30:38.802 --> 01:30:46.166]  And so the South, in the 1830s, rebelled, and Andrew Jackson had to mass an army
[01:30:47.253 --> 01:30:49.256]  And only because he's from the South, they stood down.
[01:30:49.856 --> 01:30:51.578]  And he said, I'm going to march down there and kick your butt.
[01:30:51.598 --> 01:30:52.900]  This is a British conspiracy.
[01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:54.482]  It was in the newspapers.
[01:30:55.003 --> 01:30:55.904]  So that stopped.
[01:30:56.064 --> 01:31:01.971]  Then, the Civil War wasn't about ending slavery.
[01:31:01.991 --> 01:31:05.075]  It was about controlling western expansion and taxation.
[01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:07.577]  And representation of the southern states.
[01:31:08.117 --> 01:31:13.239]  And so the British were in the south, funding the rebellion, they brought in the cannons, the weapons, everything.
[01:31:13.599 --> 01:31:24.863]  Then when the war started, they massed troops in Canada, in Ottawa, and in Toronto, 20,000 of them, and put a fleet off New York, threatening to invade.
[01:31:25.837 --> 01:31:30.338]  So, then the British Tsar sent a fleet for the North to menace them.
[01:31:31.059 --> 01:31:34.300]  That's why later in 1917, the British overthrew their cousins, the Tsars.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.360]  That was over that and other issues.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:43.343]  But you're absolutely right that Lincoln wrote all these letters and all these things and said, I do not want to free one slave.
[01:31:43.363 --> 01:31:44.403]  That's not what this is about.
[01:31:45.183 --> 01:32:12.536]  uh... this is but but but he used the only political support he had was the abolitionist who said we're going to support you but then you've got a free the slaves and then late in the war to destabilize things in the south he did do that so so so regard to me that's just a historical fact but but other people say well then aren't you for the south no andrew jackson wasn't for the south he knew that it was a setup so uh... you're absolutely right go ahead certainly one more thing i'd like to talk on on
[01:32:13.257 --> 01:32:17.459]  You know, the Telegraph, you know, with the PsyApps backslash propaganda conditioning.
[01:32:17.919 --> 01:32:27.963]  I'd also like to touch on the fact everybody thought we were nuts when the playing cards came out, the NWO cards and the FEMA pamphlets with the World Trade Center in the sky.
[01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:35.427]  In there, the government flies jumbo jets, blows up the World Trade Center, stages everything they've been doing, and that guy was right here in Austin that made those cards.
[01:32:36.307 --> 01:32:41.029]  I mean, that's... I don't know who that guy was talking to or who he's with, but
[01:32:41.963 --> 01:32:46.288]  I mean, I don't know if you saw the writing on the wall, but I mean, they're all tied in.
[01:32:46.309 --> 01:32:50.474]  The Illuminati, they put it out there right for the blind, right down to Walt Disney.
[01:32:50.714 --> 01:32:51.154]  I hear you.
[01:32:51.214 --> 01:32:54.258]  In the Narnia series, the A is the Masonic symbol.
[01:32:54.859 --> 01:32:55.980]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:32:57.248 --> 01:33:02.793]  Sometimes they plant these in pop culture, other times they pick up pop culture ideas and then stage it.
[01:33:03.294 --> 01:33:19.108]  The CIA and the Defense Department, the last time I saw it, the Defense Department alone was spending $48 million a year paying for scripts from the biggest script writing houses in Los Angeles and in Burbank and places of fictional terror attacks.
[01:33:19.768 --> 01:33:20.549]  As scenario.
[01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:23.631]  So, there's a big PSYOP going on.
[01:33:23.671 --> 01:33:24.271]  You're absolutely right.
[01:33:24.291 --> 01:33:25.072]  Let's go to the next caller.
[01:33:25.112 --> 01:33:25.712]  Gotta hurry now.
[01:33:26.012 --> 01:33:27.673]  That was a great caller, but I spent seven minutes with him.
[01:33:27.994 --> 01:33:29.034]  Bradley in Delaware.
[01:33:29.074 --> 01:33:29.635]  You're on the air.
[01:33:29.675 --> 01:33:30.415]  Go ahead, Bradley.
[01:33:30.996 --> 01:33:31.376]  Hey, Alex.
[01:33:31.436 --> 01:33:32.456]  It's Brady, but thanks.
[01:33:33.297 --> 01:33:37.340]  Yesterday I had Jason Burmiss on, and he was talking about that game crackdown.
[01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:41.622]  And in that game, you're a super soldier for the state.
[01:33:41.723 --> 01:33:48.307]  Did you know at the end of that game, they actually, the guy that's like your controller, actually says,
[01:33:48.848 --> 01:33:49.908]  Do you know who set this all up?
[01:33:50.389 --> 01:33:50.869]  We did it.
[01:33:51.289 --> 01:34:10.677]  And it's like they're throwing it out there blatantly obvious, and most people just... So at the end of the game, they admit that the government started the terror attacks as a pretext to attack the population, and on giant cartoons they're putting in one of the biggest newspapers in the world, the government stages terror attacks to put us all in FEMA camps and bring in the North American Union.
[01:34:10.937 --> 01:34:16.839]  You're telling me that game then, that you've gone to the end of, does like all the other games.
[01:34:16.959 --> 01:34:18.180]  There was another game, Do Sex.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.722]  Where at the end of the game you learn the government was staging the terror attacks.
[01:34:22.482 --> 01:34:24.264]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[01:34:24.504 --> 01:34:30.067]  So at the end, hold on, at the end the commander calls you in and says, good job, we staged the terror attack?
[01:34:30.908 --> 01:34:40.574]  Yeah, at the end of the game you're actually playing the soldier and you're fighting gangs and terrorists and taking out criminals and at the end of the game he goes, well who funded these people?
[01:34:40.815 --> 01:34:41.395]  Well guess who?
[01:34:41.755 --> 01:34:42.276]  It was us.
[01:34:42.396 --> 01:34:44.257]  It was us, the government, the guy that's running you.
[01:34:46.212 --> 01:34:47.273]  That's pretty incredible.
[01:34:47.493 --> 01:34:49.514]  And then what else does he say?
[01:34:50.614 --> 01:34:51.415]  That's all I remember.
[01:34:51.435 --> 01:34:52.835]  I played the game about a year ago.
[01:34:52.855 --> 01:34:58.758]  I know through the whole thing that you get unlimited fun, you get all these guns all the time, all you want.
[01:34:58.978 --> 01:35:07.163]  You can jump on buildings and blow stuff up and it's like, they're just shoving it in your face like, here you go, this is what we're doing.
[01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:13.826]  And these young children are identifying with their tribal warfare programming with walking up and assassinating citizens.
[01:35:13.866 --> 01:35:15.767]  Burma said you go around killing Americans, right?
[01:35:16.345 --> 01:35:17.085]  Yeah, basically.
[01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:22.128]  Well, yeah, because it looks a lot like Seattle or Washington, D.C.
[01:35:22.609 --> 01:35:25.650]  And I guess one quick thing, and I'll get off because I know you're short on time.
[01:35:25.811 --> 01:35:35.296]  I was talking to somebody I know that's in the law enforcement division, and he said that they're trying to secretly or quietly push through gun confiscation, gun bans.
[01:35:35.736 --> 01:35:39.979]  My question is, if they're trying to push it through Congress and they don't have any real power, why don't they just do it?
[01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:41.611]  Well, they are!
[01:35:41.691 --> 01:35:44.993]  They have gun sweeps from the National Guard in Illinois and other places.
[01:35:46.254 --> 01:35:47.816]  They are tracking gun owners.
[01:35:48.817 --> 01:35:54.421]  They've introduced the bills without even, well, just with executive fiat, not even a bill!
[01:35:54.661 --> 01:35:57.644]  They're saying they can just say whoever they want can't own a gun.
[01:35:58.124 --> 01:35:59.425]  I mean, this is it, man!
[01:35:59.506 --> 01:36:07.072]  These are, look, the same banks that funded the Bolsheviks, on record, and the same banks that funded Hitler and Mao and now declassified,
[01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:11.014]  In fact, guys, bring it in here to me.
[01:36:11.135 --> 01:36:14.823]  I brought my book, Descent into Tyranny, in and it's got paper shoved in with it.
[01:36:15.714 --> 01:36:16.815]  I think it's laying on the table over there.
[01:36:16.835 --> 01:36:18.036]  It's David Rockefeller quotes.
[01:36:18.996 --> 01:36:20.437]  These are bibliographed, okay?
[01:36:20.998 --> 01:36:23.459]  These quotes I'm putting in the new film for Endgame.
[01:36:23.479 --> 01:36:24.500]  These are quotes I didn't use.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.862]  These are quotes that we sent off for the newspapers and went to the library.
[01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:29.063]  These are real quotes.
[01:36:29.944 --> 01:36:32.265]  And in here he talks about how he doesn't pay taxes.
[01:36:33.146 --> 01:36:41.391]  In here they say, the supernational sovereignty of an intellectual elite with world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practice of past centuries.
[01:36:41.791 --> 01:36:43.633]  David Rockefeller and Bilderberg Group address.
[01:36:44.293 --> 01:36:44.913]  He's got other
[01:36:46.735 --> 01:36:49.897]  Shickening quotes in here about all the things they're planning.
[01:36:49.917 --> 01:36:51.639]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:36:52.639 --> 01:36:54.481]  No, I agree with you.
[01:36:54.761 --> 01:37:03.528]  I'm glad that you woke me up and that Fox News report this morning that we're all crazy and we're idiotic and we have a mental disorder.
[01:37:04.689 --> 01:37:08.952]  I don't think that they understand what's coming out of their own mouths.
[01:37:09.753 --> 01:37:11.534]  Well, I mean, absolutely.
[01:37:11.554 --> 01:37:11.815]  Thank you.
[01:37:12.833 --> 01:37:15.134]  They have different slices of the public.
[01:37:15.174 --> 01:37:16.955]  Totally dumbed down, can't even talk.
[01:37:17.835 --> 01:37:21.217]  Pretty much dumbed down, know about cartoons and football.
[01:37:22.377 --> 01:37:24.298]  Somewhat informed that think they're geniuses.
[01:37:24.618 --> 01:37:28.640]  Then kind of establishment wonks who think they know more, who are in a left front paradigm.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:32.902]  And then evil people who serve the New World Order that really know what's going on, and then the good people.
[01:37:33.943 --> 01:37:35.924]  And so they're servicing different propaganda.
[01:37:35.944 --> 01:37:40.707]  That's why they'll say on shows every day, there is no plan for a world government if you say it, you're a child molester.
[01:37:41.407 --> 01:37:44.689]  There is no plan for a world government if you say it, it's secret racism code.
[01:37:45.089 --> 01:37:52.814]  There is no plan for a world government or gun confiscation if you say it, you're mentally ill and they now have mentally ill psychological designations, hundreds of them.
[01:37:54.042 --> 01:37:58.904]  If you believe in a New World Order conspiracy theory, this is in FBI training manuals, you're a terrorist, you're mentally ill.
[01:37:59.404 --> 01:38:09.169]  While then, to a certain segment, the so-called intelligentsia, in the Financial Times of London and the Wall Street Journal, they say, world government was kept secret for your own good.
[01:38:09.249 --> 01:38:11.130]  It's here now, it's going to save you.
[01:38:11.230 --> 01:38:12.130]  This is word for word.
[01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:16.092]  It is dictatorial, but dictatorial is good.
[01:38:16.892 --> 01:38:18.813]  What did David Rockefeller say in that quote?
[01:38:20.474 --> 01:38:20.794]  You see?
[01:38:22.202 --> 01:38:32.510]  So see, for the general public, kids sitting in public school right now, they're watching film clips and stuff, saying New World Order doesn't exist, you're insane if you say it exists, but then their very textbook says it does exist and is good.
[01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:37.434]  That teaches the child double-think, that it's real, but I'm crazy if I talk about it.
[01:38:38.075 --> 01:38:41.938]  This is psychological warfare, hardcore programming.
[01:38:42.358 --> 01:38:43.779]  Leo and Mash, you're on the air.
[01:38:43.799 --> 01:38:46.861]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[01:38:47.342 --> 01:38:50.925]  I'm a subscriber, and number one,
[01:38:51.775 --> 01:38:53.677]  KRS, that long interview?
[01:38:54.737 --> 01:38:55.298]  Yes.
[01:38:55.558 --> 01:38:59.141]  Could you please, please put that out on YouTube?
[01:38:59.161 --> 01:39:05.086]  I mean, I want to put it out to my list, and I'm worried that when I send it out, they won't be able to access it.
[01:39:05.186 --> 01:39:06.287]  Okay, let me explain something.
[01:39:07.662 --> 01:39:17.489]  We streamed a shorter KSR 1 interview, 20 minutes long, here last week, last Friday, on the PrisonPlanet.tv live stream.
[01:39:17.829 --> 01:39:22.493]  It's got close to 100,000 views, last time I checked, just on one video channel.
[01:39:23.814 --> 01:39:34.081]  We did finally post, in the super high quality for PrisonPlanet.tv members, the longer KSR 1, KRS 1, always got to do that, interview today.
[01:39:34.541 --> 01:39:35.262]  So don't worry,
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.104]  The PrisonPlanet.tv members will rip it seven ways to Sunday and post it everywhere.
[01:39:41.425 --> 01:39:44.608]  Just being a member, you get first access, higher quality, and you support us.
[01:39:45.468 --> 01:39:47.971]  So it will be on YouTube.
[01:39:47.991 --> 01:39:49.612]  If it isn't already there, it'll be there soon.
[01:39:49.852 --> 01:39:52.935]  Yes, it's a longer interview right now for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:39:52.975 --> 01:39:53.376]  Anything else?
[01:39:53.796 --> 01:39:58.841]  Yeah, could you get a translator and some closed captioning so that people can
[01:39:59.875 --> 01:40:02.756]  Word of the speaker, the languages can go into that area.
[01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:05.977]  And it might be a little expensive, but there are a lot of free translators, right?
[01:40:06.037 --> 01:40:07.038]  And the important thing is this.
[01:40:07.378 --> 01:40:13.020]  Yesterday, I noticed somebody was jamming the sound on your video show.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:19.403]  And it was coming out... So that's... How long did that go?
[01:40:19.943 --> 01:40:20.763]  Over about half an hour.
[01:40:20.823 --> 01:40:21.224]  I gave up.
[01:40:21.264 --> 01:40:22.304]  I just went on to the flash.
[01:40:22.344 --> 01:40:23.244]  The flash was clean.
[01:40:24.025 --> 01:40:24.305]  Audio.
[01:40:24.325 --> 01:40:25.145]  The flash audio was clean.
[01:40:25.165 --> 01:40:25.425]  I know.
[01:40:25.465 --> 01:40:26.346]  Somebody was jamming.
[01:40:26.366 --> 01:40:27.006]  That's probably...
[01:40:27.898 --> 01:40:34.021]  Probably the people in... I want to send you my thing, I can't find your address anywhere on it.
[01:40:34.281 --> 01:40:35.442]  What is wrong with your site?
[01:40:35.782 --> 01:40:37.843]  Why is it an abortion basically?
[01:40:37.863 --> 01:40:38.843]  Your site is an abortion.
[01:40:39.183 --> 01:40:42.925]  I cannot find anything because you have all this stuff jammed in.
[01:40:42.965 --> 01:40:50.609]  I don't mind having the advertising, but the rest of the space, could you have like little blocks for little segments so that we can go to whatever segment of the site we want to go to?
[01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:52.330]  My site is an abortion, well that's a...
[01:40:53.237 --> 01:40:53.698]  Thank you.
[01:40:54.038 --> 01:40:54.499]  Thank you.
[01:40:56.582 --> 01:40:59.986]  I try to access your site and I go berserk trying to find simple things.
[01:41:00.827 --> 01:41:02.269]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:06.835]  Sir, you really should check the site every day because 40, 50, 60 things are posted.
[01:41:07.376 --> 01:41:08.557]  It goes into archives.
[01:41:08.658 --> 01:41:09.218]  We went web 2.0.
[01:41:10.967 --> 01:41:13.609]  We're trying to upgrade it, make it work better.
[01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:15.671]  They're very popular sites.
[01:41:15.891 --> 01:41:20.975]  Infowars.com is, you know, thousands of times in ranking bigger than RushLimbaugh.com.
[01:41:21.115 --> 01:41:23.356]  Look at it on Alexa.com or all those other stat systems.
[01:41:24.217 --> 01:41:25.158]  We're trying our best.
[01:41:25.178 --> 01:41:33.244]  I mean, I can barely make the money to get an extra IT guy and an extra somebody who's an expert on WordPress and Joomla and all these other systems we're using.
[01:41:33.804 --> 01:41:34.485]  But we're doing it.
[01:41:34.725 --> 01:41:36.286]  But then you don't want advertisements.
[01:41:37.187 --> 01:41:37.967]  Let me get this straight.
[01:41:38.348 --> 01:41:39.689]  You want me to get
[01:41:41.075 --> 01:41:42.116]  Translators in here.
[01:41:43.938 --> 01:41:46.201]  Maybe they'll work for free for a few days, but the people need to eat.
[01:41:47.182 --> 01:41:51.307]  And then I'm supposed to get translators in here and do it closed captioning.
[01:41:53.297 --> 01:41:54.717]  When I don't have the money.
[01:41:55.657 --> 01:42:03.199]  So let me take this opportunity to tell you folks, not just that I carry great books and videos of the films I made at Infowars.com on this online shopping cart.
[01:42:03.679 --> 01:42:05.119]  That's what funds this operation.
[01:42:05.159 --> 01:42:06.459]  So buy a bunch of books and videos.
[01:42:06.719 --> 01:42:07.800]  We're trying to expand.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:21.542]  But I mean, really, when I get told I need to do more, I got home at one o'clock last night from working and then my wife got sick and she's sick and so the baby was waking up at
[01:42:22.318 --> 01:42:24.379]  You know, 530 in the morning, I was up with the baby.
[01:42:24.399 --> 01:42:28.621]  And then I had to get people to come over so I could leave to come to work.
[01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:32.783]  So I've been feeding babies and changing diapers and then I get here and...
[01:42:36.164 --> 01:42:38.326]  I'm directing these possum bellies that work here.
[01:42:38.346 --> 01:42:43.651]  And, uh, you know, I mean, I mean, I'm not whining here, but I mean, I am not Superman.
[01:42:43.711 --> 01:42:45.473]  I can't just, like, SHAZAM!
[01:42:45.533 --> 01:42:46.314]  Closed captioning.
[01:42:46.614 --> 01:42:47.355]  SHAZAM!
[01:42:47.395 --> 01:42:48.516]  Website has everything you want.
[01:42:48.836 --> 01:42:49.597]  SHAZAM!
[01:42:49.677 --> 01:42:50.357]  SHAZAM!
[01:42:50.538 --> 01:42:51.859]  But then, don't advertise, though.
[01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:52.720]  Do it without money, Alex.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:56.741]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:42:56.901 --> 01:43:02.123]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:43:02.423 --> 01:43:07.785]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:43:08.125 --> 01:43:09.266]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:09.626 --> 01:43:18.509]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:43:18.929 --> 01:43:20.570]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:43:20.770 --> 01:43:24.952]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:52.553]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:43:53.875 --> 01:43:55.296]  It is a big idea.
[01:43:56.357 --> 01:43:58.999]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:43:59.913 --> 01:44:02.375]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:44:02.395 --> 01:44:05.138]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:05.818 --> 01:44:08.060]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:11.083]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:44:11.783 --> 01:44:19.110]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:22.133 --> 01:44:27.096]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:27.577 --> 01:44:31.059]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:31.459 --> 01:44:33.921]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:44:34.021 --> 01:44:35.162]  Most people have no idea.
[01:44:35.182 --> 01:44:35.942]  They're not after money.
[01:44:35.962 --> 01:44:37.043]  They have all the money they need.
[01:44:37.243 --> 01:44:37.984]  They're after power.
[01:44:38.224 --> 01:44:39.084]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:44:39.365 --> 01:44:43.908]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:44:44.128 --> 01:44:47.610]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:50.852]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:44:50.892 --> 01:44:51.993]  You have been warned.
[01:44:53.574 --> 01:44:56.637]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.118]  You may have no choice.
[01:44:58.799 --> 01:45:01.661]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[01:45:02.002 --> 01:45:05.805]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[01:45:06.565 --> 01:45:13.351]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401Ks and IRAs.
[01:45:14.172 --> 01:45:18.836]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.721]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.
[01:45:23.241 --> 01:45:27.361]  Put your retirement money beyond the reach of government financiers today by calling 1-866-323-5665.
[01:45:27.702 --> 01:45:34.623]  SafeGrow IRAs are just a phone call away.
[01:45:35.523 --> 01:45:37.383]  That's 1-866-323-5665.
[01:45:37.883 --> 01:45:41.404]  Microgym and Midas Resources can help you protect your retirement nest egg.
[01:45:41.944 --> 01:45:46.345]  Get informed and ask for our free report on the unseen fallout of the Fannie Freddie rescue.
[01:45:46.903 --> 01:45:47.383]  Call 1-866-323-5665.
[01:45:47.904 --> 01:46:15.544]  I'd love to just settle in Beachels to music like this, relaxing, deep sea fishing, hanging out with my family, but no!
[01:46:17.628 --> 01:46:21.089]  No, I will burn the midnight oil and I will be told I'm doing a crappy job.
[01:46:21.730 --> 01:46:23.611]  Maybe so, but we're going to keep doing that job.
[01:46:24.131 --> 01:46:25.251]  We're the best at it there is.
[01:46:25.811 --> 01:46:26.972]  Doesn't say much, does it?
[01:46:28.513 --> 01:46:32.114]  I'm meant to spend more time on this, I will tomorrow, but let's get into it now.
[01:46:32.874 --> 01:46:36.896]  This is Mr. Press with his radio show in D.C.
[01:46:36.956 --> 01:46:37.636]  with a U.S.
[01:46:37.656 --> 01:46:44.359]  Senator saying, oh yes, we want to hold talk radio accountable and we want to tell stations what they've got to air and what they've got to do.
[01:46:46.874 --> 01:46:48.495]  Here you go, the attack on the First Amendment.
[01:46:49.116 --> 01:46:57.501]  And this is all being spurred by the domestic act that they're trying to push, the Violent Radicalization Act, restricting internet, free speech, this show, and a lot more.
[01:46:57.521 --> 01:46:59.923]  Maybe if they take me off the air, it'll be a vacation.
[01:46:59.983 --> 01:47:00.383]  I don't know.
[01:47:02.404 --> 01:47:03.785]  Alex, you gotta stop them from doing this.
[01:47:03.905 --> 01:47:04.746]  Okay, I'll try.
[01:47:05.026 --> 01:47:05.687]  What about you?
[01:47:06.447 --> 01:47:07.768]  Let's go ahead and go to some of this audio.
[01:47:09.509 --> 01:47:16.634]  You certainly have been one of, if not the most supportive voices in the United States Senate for progressive talk radio.
[01:47:17.361 --> 01:47:24.686]  So I know you must be dismayed to learn that here in Washington, D.C., as we've been talking about this hour, Obama 1260 is going away.
[01:47:24.826 --> 01:47:25.947]  They're changing the format.
[01:47:25.967 --> 01:47:29.929]  They're dumping progressive talk, which, as you know, Senator, they've done in market after market.
[01:47:29.949 --> 01:47:30.369]  Did you hear that?
[01:47:30.409 --> 01:47:32.271]  A radio station named after Obama?
[01:47:32.291 --> 01:47:35.513]  San Diego, Sacramento, Miami this last week.
[01:47:35.533 --> 01:47:37.034]  Because you suck, that's why.
[01:47:37.054 --> 01:47:38.214]  What can we do about that?
[01:47:38.334 --> 01:47:43.618]  And aren't owners of radio stations required to provide some balance of voices?
[01:47:43.838 --> 01:47:45.799]  You're a sniveling idiot.
[01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:46.240]  Absolutely.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:55.344]  It's such a disservice to the public and I continue to think that we need to be seeing a couple things happen.
[01:47:55.384 --> 01:48:08.471]  Just continuing to support great radio hosts like yourself and promoting more programs that are coming into the marketplace.
[01:48:08.511 --> 01:48:11.392]  But we're going to have to have some accountability.
[01:48:11.472 --> 01:48:14.374]  You know, we had something called the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:48:15.453 --> 01:48:20.576]  Back until the 80s when it was removed where you had to have balance.
[01:48:21.177 --> 01:48:32.743]  And I think something that requires that in a market with owners that have multiple stations, that they have got to have balance.
[01:48:32.763 --> 01:48:41.108]  There has to be some community interest balance standard that says both sides have to be heard.
[01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:42.889]  And I think that
[01:48:43.889 --> 01:48:55.076]  You know, I see this myself as a member of the Senate, when you see... Okay, and it goes on and on how they want to do this, and they're talking about introducing bills, or having the FCC through Fiat do it, just order it.
[01:48:55.236 --> 01:48:58.718]  They did this before, until the late 80s, you couldn't have any political opinion.
[01:48:58.738 --> 01:49:00.679]  It was just all repeat government propaganda.
[01:49:00.979 --> 01:49:03.821]  And then it became neocon fake information, but so what?
[01:49:04.241 --> 01:49:06.922]  You can't stop free speech, and you can't shut it down.
[01:49:07.643 --> 01:49:11.025]  And they want to make people put Bill Press on.
[01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:14.851]  With that buzzing audio.
[01:49:15.832 --> 01:49:21.238]  I mean, they want to make you listen to this, and they keep talking about both sides, as if it's Republican and Democrat.
[01:49:21.518 --> 01:49:25.322]  No, it's Republican and Democrat together here, and then we the people are right here.
[01:49:26.162 --> 01:49:31.327]  And this whole attack, the FCC's talking about regulating the Internet, and websites and news sites.
[01:49:32.538 --> 01:49:37.360]  And the government's talked about making all sites be handicapped accessible.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:39.641]  Little sites and people can't pay for that and can't do it.
[01:49:39.881 --> 01:49:41.122]  That'll bring it down to a handful.
[01:49:41.722 --> 01:49:49.946]  They are trying to shut down free speech on the internet too and taxing and regulating and no more peer-to-peer or net neutrality.
[01:49:50.466 --> 01:49:51.666]  They're attacking free speech.
[01:49:51.686 --> 01:49:56.829]  So in the time we've got, let's continue to fight for free speech and expand our platform as much as possible.
[01:49:57.799 --> 01:49:59.941]  We had Bob Chapman on.
[01:49:59.981 --> 01:50:01.103]  We had Steve Watson on.
[01:50:01.163 --> 01:50:08.691]  I covered a lot of key news in the first hour dealing with the eight states saying, we know your New World Order.
[01:50:08.711 --> 01:50:09.972]  We know you're building FEMA camps.
[01:50:09.992 --> 01:50:10.873]  This is in bills.
[01:50:11.654 --> 01:50:12.996]  And we're not going along with this.
[01:50:13.056 --> 01:50:18.742]  So that is very exciting and a story that Kurt Nemo wrote that links to all the mainstream documents and information on that.
[01:50:19.122 --> 01:50:23.205]  So we'll be back tomorrow, well back Sunday actually, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:50:23.225 --> 01:50:27.247]  on the radio, but the retransmission starts now at Infowars.com on the streams.
[01:50:27.267 --> 01:50:30.530]  We'll be back in 70 seconds, so stay with us.

[01:50:43.629 --> 01:50:45.190]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:50.031]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:52.812]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:53.013 --> 01:50:55.874]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:56.074 --> 01:51:01.896]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:02.136 --> 01:51:04.678]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation.
[01:51:04.898 --> 01:51:12.263]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
