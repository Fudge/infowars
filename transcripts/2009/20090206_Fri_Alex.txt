[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.670]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.251]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:16.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.077]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:49.120]  Eight states and growing are telling the federal government it is completely rogue and criminal that they will not put up with gun confiscation, concentration camps, staged terror attacks, you name it.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.723]  Increasing number of states declaring sovereignty.
[00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:56.185]  This article by Kurt Nimmo will be going over it early in this hour.
[00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:04.956]  Then we've got Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster, with his once-a-week visit with us to cover the huge developments the last seven days in the economy.
[00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:11.923]  Then we've got Steve Watson, the webmaster of Infowars.net and a writer for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:19.691]  The Blackjack articles, three series that have run in a major British international newspaper,
[00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:30.763]  Where it shows the government staging terror attacks and bringing in a New World Order and a North American Union.
[00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:32.663]  Why are they doing this?
[00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:39.385]  The paper, this has been going on for weeks, will not comment on the series and say what the whole point of it is.
[00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:40.185]  Very mysterious.
[00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.785]  We'll also have open phones today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:42.845]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:51.288 --> 00:01:53.689]  In the last two days there's been big developments.
[00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:04.275]  SEC lawyer last night made claims of executive privilege under national security on the Bernie Madoff scandal.
[00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:07.117]  The 50, no one knows, to 100 million dollars missing.
[00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:12.780]  He's allowed to stay out of jail, be in his own house with his own security guards.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.522]  SEC lawyer clamps up
[00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:22.084]  on Madoff scandal, cites executive privilege.
[00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:37.094]  Huge new development and Madoff whistleblower testifies a few days ago and blasts the SEC saying that he feared for his life when he went to them nine plus years ago, almost ten years ago, with it all wrapped up in a pretty bow, is his quote.
[00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.584]  of the fraud, and that he basically believes the SEC was involved in it with them.
[00:02:44.584 --> 00:03:05.639]  Now, I watched part of his testimony on C-SPAN, and when you ended up seeing it up on the news, it'd be, oh, Independent Financial Fraud Investigator Harry Markopoulos appeared before the House Financial Services Subcommittee, and he said that the SEC was scared of Madoff and were just a bunch of idiots.
[00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.681]  Well, no, that's not what he said.
[00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:18.853]  And he put in submissions in 1999, in 2001, in 2005, in 2007, in 2008, over and over again.
[00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:37.568]  And now we have Madoff tied into AIPAC, the big American-Israeli group that has the biggest, they don't have the most money of any lobbying group out there, more than all the defense contractors, more than the oil companies, lobbying in Washington, running their members for Congress,
[00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.965]  Now the largest single bloc in Congress are AIPAC.
[00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:43.666]  Oh yeah!
[00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:49.149]  It's not the Black Caucus or the Southern Caucus or the Liberal Caucus.
[00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:50.630]  No, it's the AIPAC Caucus.
[00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:02.882]  He was donating large portions of the stolen billions, funneling it into Israel and into Brazil and other areas and right back into AIPAC.
[00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:04.223]  That's now coming out.
[00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:09.885]  We first heard that from Bob Chapman here months ago when all this broke and now it's coming out in the mainstream news.
[00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:11.926]  And what's old Bush say?
[00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.447]  National security!
[00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:20.550]  The SEC says we're citing executive privilege under national security.
[00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.211]  We're not going to tell you why we didn't
[00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:29.499]  And the SEC kept saying over and over again, it's alleged that Mr. Madoff did this.
[00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:30.219]  It's alleged.
[00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:36.043]  And finally one congressperson said, wait a minute, this isn't alleged, he's confessed on national television.
[00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:45.869]  And then they just said, look, executive privilege, executive privilege, national security, we're not telling you where the...
[00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:48.027]  Probably over 100 billion.
[00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:50.129]  The media is saying 50 billion.
[00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.851]  Evidence is over 100 billion.
[00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.153]  And this is only one front company, folks.
[00:04:54.153 --> 00:04:55.615]  One front company.
[00:04:55.615 --> 00:04:58.117]  And Madoff's taking the fall for them.
[00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:00.539]  He'll probably stage his death like the head of Enron.
[00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.984]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from hempusa.org.
[00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:14.190]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.094]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:05:19.094 --> 00:05:26.178]  There are no filters to buy, and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from hempusa.org.
[00:05:26.178 --> 00:05:32.563]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:34.104]  Detoxification may result with
[00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:34.945]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[00:06:03.737 --> 00:06:06.258]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.258 --> 00:06:07.598]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:09.578]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:16.600]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:25.122]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:32.607]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:35.788]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:41.549]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:44.630]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:51.851]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:56.075]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck, EFoodStuff.
[00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:17.673]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:07:17.673 --> 00:07:25.718]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy delicious food for every need.
[00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:32.782]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:34.823]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:07:34.823 --> 00:07:35.924]  The 3-Day Responder
[00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:40.391]  is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.813]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:47.375]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:50.117]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:50.117 --> 00:07:52.438]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:08.571]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:16.293]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.293 --> 00:08:24.475]  The United States has been hijacked, like every other major nation in the world, by tyrants.
[00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:50.892]  Every other nation on the planet has been hijacked from time to time, more often than not by tyrants, and the very crew that has brought down hundreds of third world nations through fraud, and then brought their populations into sharecropper bondage through fraudulent debt, now has this nation in a stranglehold.
[00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:55.695]  If they are able to use their pitch man, their front man, Barack Obama, to sell
[00:08:57.458 --> 00:09:01.639]  Further erosions of liberties and freedoms for security.
[00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:03.219]  Further wars.
[00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:07.000]  Expansions of the dictatorial power of the private banks.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.981]  They will succeed.
[00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:13.062]  And as things get worse and worse, they'll always say the same thing.
[00:09:13.062 --> 00:09:14.562]  Hey, we're in a crisis.
[00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:15.882]  Give us everything we want.
[00:09:15.882 --> 00:09:17.203]  Give them everything they want.
[00:09:17.203 --> 00:09:18.383]  Things get worse.
[00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:19.903]  Hey, we're in a crisis.
[00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:21.404]  Give us everything we want.
[00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:23.344]  And then things get worse.
[00:09:23.344 --> 00:09:25.205]  Hey, see, things got worse.
[00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:26.005]  Give us even more.
[00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.115]  And then things get worse.
[00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:53.184]  Remember hope and change and everything was going to be great and then now Obama says pass this stimulus package over a trillion bucks for golf courses and yacht clubs and CPS, kidnapping children and abortion funding, amongst other things, federalization of police, or we will have a catastrophe.
[00:09:55.063 --> 00:09:56.664]  We will have a depression.
[00:09:56.664 --> 00:10:08.032]  And all these CEOs and bank heads line up like a bunch of parrots, a tree full of cockatoos, chirping the same message.
[00:10:08.032 --> 00:10:09.133]  But the polls are out.
[00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:11.614]  Upwards of 80% of the people are against the stimulus.
[00:10:11.614 --> 00:10:15.337]  98% in the major polls.
[00:10:15.337 --> 00:10:18.839]  1,000 to 1 phone calls against the original banker takeover.
[00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:22.362]  They got 20% of the public that thinks it's quote free money in a handout.
[00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:25.597]  Who are for it.
[00:10:25.597 --> 00:10:27.058]  And I hear them calling in to talk radio.
[00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:29.120]  They are so dumbed down.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.001]  They are like lambs to the slaughter.
[00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:32.683]  It's like, hey, we need this money.
[00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:37.267]  Hey, we need to give this money to people to get things going again.
[00:10:37.267 --> 00:10:41.491]  You've got to pay all that back in taxes, you buffoons.
[00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.813]  It's going to devalue what money you do have.
[00:10:43.813 --> 00:10:48.897]  It's going to devalue the currency and your savings while you also have to pay it back.
[00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:49.518]  Do you understand that?
[00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.111]  But they don't care.
[00:10:54.111 --> 00:11:02.935]  Criminals, parasites at every level of government know that the globalists are completely imploding the West as they've done the third world.
[00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:12.240]  So they're just busy snatching and grabbing whatever they can as fast as they can.
[00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:26.064]  Madoff, whistleblower, testifies, blasts the SEC.
[00:11:26.064 --> 00:11:39.453]  All things considered, February 4, 2009, when Bernard Madoff was arrested and charged with running a giant Ponzi scheme, many people were shocked, but not Harry Markopolos.
[00:11:39.453 --> 00:11:45.758]  He's the man who looked at Madoff's investment returns a decade ago and figured they didn't add up.
[00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:54.016]  Markopolos made several attempts to persuade the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate, all for naught.
[00:11:54.016 --> 00:11:57.039]  He had no trouble Wednesday getting people to listen.
[00:11:57.039 --> 00:12:03.525]  He told a congressional panel in Washington that the SEC is a failed regulator that was unable to protect investors.
[00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:04.486]  Well, he said more than that.
[00:12:05.228 --> 00:12:08.010]  I've just been too busy to go up to YouTube and grab all the select clips.
[00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.191]  I watched a bunch of them last night.
[00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:11.632]  We may play some later in the show today.
[00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:15.494]  We're certainly going to post them up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:22.318]  So see, the media is kind of whitewashing what he really said.
[00:12:22.318 --> 00:12:25.860]  Marco Polo said it took him just five minutes to figure out that
[00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:28.709]  Madoff was running a scam.
[00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:32.592]  He only had to look at the performance chart for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.
[00:12:32.592 --> 00:12:33.393]  Yeah.
[00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:46.002]  Anytime you hear somebody say, for 20 years, or for 15 years, or for 30 years, like Madoff was claiming, we have a 15 plus percent profit guaranteed.
[00:12:46.002 --> 00:12:48.404]  You hear that, you know it's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:12:48.404 --> 00:12:50.206]  Period.
[00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.728]  And I hear it all the time with other scammers out there.
[00:12:53.686 --> 00:13:03.128]  So if you hear that, if you hear somebody say, we have a guaranteed investment that decade to decade will give you 15 plus percent every time, run!
[00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:05.148]  Don't walk, run!
[00:13:05.148 --> 00:13:05.809]  Run!
[00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:13.130]  Screaming, warning people in the other direction.
[00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.151]  It was a 45 degree angle without any variation, he said.
[00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:18.551]  It went in only one direction, up.
[00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:21.352]  It never had variation like the market does, like this.
[00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:25.917]  That was a key tip-off.
[00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:31.781]  Marco Polo and his staff did some more digging and came to the conclusion that Madoff was cheating his investors.
[00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:37.345]  As the investment went on, Marco Polo said he feared for his safety and that of his family.
[00:13:37.345 --> 00:13:40.607]  So he presented his findings anonymously to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:43.389]  Only a few officials knew his real name.
[00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.931]  He said he kept returning to the SEC to figure.
[00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:50.531]  to urge it to take up the case and was repeatedly ignored.
[00:13:50.531 --> 00:14:01.741]  Unfortunately, as they didn't respond to my written submissions in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008, here we are today, Marco Polo said.
[00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:05.344]  Meanwhile, Madoff's operations grew bigger and he attracted more investors.
[00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.205]  You have to in a Ponzi scheme.
[00:14:07.205 --> 00:14:13.571]  Marco Polo said he made it clear to the congressional panel that he thinks the SEC fell down on the job.
[00:14:15.777 --> 00:14:19.178]  I gift-wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them.
[00:14:19.178 --> 00:14:21.099]  It's not the largest Ponzi scheme.
[00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:31.003]  Social Security, the Defense Department, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, those are the biggest Ponzi schemes in history, okay?
[00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.964]  The Fractional Reserve Banking itself is.
[00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:44.941]  I gift-wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them, and somehow they couldn't be bothered to conduct a thorough and proper investigation because they were too busy on matters of higher priority, he said.
[00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:50.865]  If a $50 billion Ponzi scheme doesn't make the SEC priority list, then I want to know what sets their priorities.
[00:14:50.865 --> 00:14:52.906]  Let me tell you what sets their priorities.
[00:14:52.906 --> 00:15:01.572]  We leaked this a year and a half ago, just as much as I was allowed to say, and then when it came out in the New York Times two months ago, I covered it.
[00:15:03.106 --> 00:15:18.076]  Mark Cuban, who made billions of dollars, three billion dollars selling a system to Yahoo, and who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team in a Hollywood production studio.
[00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:30.727]  Call Charlie Sheen up and said, I hear you might be working on this loose change final cut film, voicing it.
[00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:34.212]  I'd like to release that through my production house 2929.
[00:15:34.212 --> 00:15:38.297]  And it was basically a done deal.
[00:15:38.297 --> 00:15:42.863]  And then internally, with no one even knowing this was going on, because we were being surveilled,
[00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:56.581]  One of the producers had a Air Force General, who is the brother-in-law, come to his house and say, your children aren't safe if you do this.
[00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.003]  And he's like, well how do you know about this?
[00:15:58.003 --> 00:16:00.465]  And they said, we know.
[00:16:00.465 --> 00:16:02.307]  That's how real these terrorists are, folks.
[00:16:02.307 --> 00:16:03.608]  That's how real they are.
[00:16:03.608 --> 00:16:04.829]  That's when you know it's real.
[00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:07.532]  That's when they start doing this stuff.
[00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:14.617]  And then we heard that they were threatening Mark Cuban secretly, but that he was still going to go ahead with it.
[00:16:14.617 --> 00:16:23.283]  Then they go public, Bill O'Reilly comes out and says, you'll be destroyed, don't do it like a mafia gangster to Sheen and Cuban.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:37.743]  Then the SEC sends an email and a phone call, this is now in the New York Times, saying, if you do this, we're going to open SEC investigations on you and your stock trading.
[00:16:37.743 --> 00:16:48.746]  And they did it, and it was a year investigation, and they indicted Mark Cuban for selling a couple hundred thousand, the guy's worth billions and billions, of his own stock, something totally legal.
[00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:50.187]  And he said, I'm going to fight you.
[00:16:50.187 --> 00:16:51.347]  And the fight's ongoing.
[00:16:52.694 --> 00:16:56.078]  So, this is what goes on in America.
[00:16:56.078 --> 00:17:04.586]  They listen to my phones, they listen to Charlie Sheen's phones, they follow me around, they death-threaten me, they call my wife up and threaten her.
[00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.927]  The New World Order is real, folks.
[00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:13.971]  Not just all the research and the data and now the news, the Wall Street Journal saying the New World Order is a great thing and will save us.
[00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:15.672]  That's basically word for word.
[00:17:15.672 --> 00:17:17.953]  The North American Union is real.
[00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:22.876]  We're going to take over the dollar and merge everything and set up a new form of government where you don't have any checks and balances or liberty.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:34.884]  They don't tell you that part, but they go on to say in the Financial Times of London that yes, now it's time for world government and the world government had to keep this secret from you, but it's for your own good and yes, it's dictatorial.
[00:17:34.884 --> 00:17:35.805]  It's dictatorial!
[00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:36.725]  You don't run anything!
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:50.207]  And meanwhile, the public was told for decades it didn't exist, so they're hearing it on TV that it exists now, and they're still, they're engaged in double-think.
[00:17:50.207 --> 00:17:56.173]  They say, it exists, and it is the answer to our problems, but simultaneously, I'm an evil kook liar.
[00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:03.457]  You know, this is quite a game of psychological brinksmanship.
[00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:20.907]  I know they can set me up, kill me anytime, go after my family, and I've just committed and just say, you know, God, it's in your hands, and then I've got to sit here and see all the COINTELPRO attacking me, and then all the weak-minded camp followers that do it, and I know that none of these people, including these minions of evil, have any future.
[00:18:21.687 --> 00:18:24.809]  Unless they wake up and join the people against this evil.
[00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:29.191]  Let me tell you something, Bernie Madoff and all these guys are taking the cops' pension funds right now.
[00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.272]  They're already telling the cops, half their money's gone.
[00:18:31.272 --> 00:18:32.953]  The firemen, at least half their money's gone.
[00:18:32.953 --> 00:18:33.974]  Some states more.
[00:18:33.974 --> 00:18:36.215]  They're already telling you, you have no money, no future.
[00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.636]  They've stolen your money too!
[00:18:37.636 --> 00:18:39.777]  But you're gonna sit there and love them?
[00:18:39.777 --> 00:18:41.618]  And sit there and go along with them?
[00:18:41.618 --> 00:18:42.939]  And you sent com guys?
[00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:44.680]  We'll come threaten us on the website?
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.520]  With your handle?
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.621]  And we'll go to your MySpace?
[00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:48.582]  And there you are threatening us on there?
[00:18:48.582 --> 00:18:48.782]  It's you?
[00:18:50.203 --> 00:18:54.685]  And you're proud you're in the military, engaging and threatening the American people?
[00:18:54.685 --> 00:18:56.266]  You think that's a good thing?
[00:18:56.266 --> 00:18:59.568]  You think your children have any future?
[00:18:59.568 --> 00:19:06.431]  You are literally, it's like going in your house, pouring gasoline all around yourself and lighting it, and then you're laughing at me?
[00:19:06.431 --> 00:19:09.413]  Oh yeah, you're burning me up, but you're burning your own butt up.
[00:19:14.252 --> 00:19:17.034]  And so I'm so deep into this thing, it's actually a good feeling.
[00:19:17.034 --> 00:19:29.043]  I'm so deep into it, nothing even matters except beating these people, and I'm just committed, and I'm just ramming the side of them, you know, forget the maneuvers, go straight at them, I'm just ramming the enemy ship, and I don't care.
[00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:31.105]  It is a good feeling.
[00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:33.306]  And I guess you on the other side, you've got a good feeling too.
[00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:40.772]  You're evil, you like it, you're committed against humanity, you're committed to wickedness, you're committed to darkness, and so, that's it.
[00:19:42.335 --> 00:19:51.963]  The two opposable, opposing forces, like two giant freight trains going 100 miles an hour apiece, are going to run straight on, head on into each other.
[00:19:51.963 --> 00:19:55.786]  And, uh, in the final equation, that's it.
[00:19:55.786 --> 00:20:00.890]  We'll come back with more news.
[00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.790]  You worry.
[00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.852]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:20:03.852 --> 00:20:06.054]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:08.601]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:10.222]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:20:10.222 --> 00:20:13.804]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:20:13.804 --> 00:20:19.048]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:20:19.048 --> 00:20:23.031]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:20:23.031 --> 00:20:24.713]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:20:24.713 --> 00:20:27.615]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:20:27.615 --> 00:20:30.557]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:39.697]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:55.659]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:07.295]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:09.936]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.477]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:11.477 --> 00:21:12.297]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.297 --> 00:21:13.298]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:13.298 --> 00:21:14.658]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:16.659]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:23.802]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:23.802 --> 00:21:24.282]  Some U.S.
[00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:29.925]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:34.127]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.928]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:04.163]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:22:04.163 --> 00:22:10.388]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:38.647]  I think so.
[00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.450]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:09.412]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.412 --> 00:23:17.814]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.851]  Clams up on Madoff scandal.
[00:24:26.851 --> 00:24:28.012]  Cites executive privilege.
[00:24:28.012 --> 00:24:33.436]  How that ties in with the whistleblower.
[00:24:33.436 --> 00:24:35.897]  How this is tied into AIPAC.
[00:24:35.897 --> 00:24:39.340]  Money laundering op.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.082]  You can buy a lot of politicians with 50 billion bucks.
[00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.531]  Also increasing number of states declaring sovereignty.
[00:24:46.531 --> 00:24:47.331]  Eight of them now.
[00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:56.133]  Washington State, New Hampshire, Arizona, Montana, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, California, Georgia.
[00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:57.693]  GE chief warns of U.S.
[00:24:57.693 --> 00:24:59.433]  depression threat.
[00:24:59.433 --> 00:25:00.933]  Financial Times of London.
[00:25:00.933 --> 00:25:08.355]  Blackjack 3 telegraph continues propaganda piece depicts concentration camps, martial law, government staging terror attacks.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.863]  Top Democratic Senator says Dems are going to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:25:15.863 --> 00:25:17.224]  We have the audio clip of that.
[00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:17.945]  That's coming up.
[00:25:19.423 --> 00:25:21.444]  Horrible story here, but people need to hear it.
[00:25:21.444 --> 00:25:24.505]  Florida doctor investigated in baby botched abortion.
[00:25:24.505 --> 00:25:27.546]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:37.670]  Every day, all over the country, in every major abortion facility that does late terms, they don't sell the baby parts.
[00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.672]  In China they keep them alive, in some cases for medical experiments.
[00:25:40.672 --> 00:25:41.292]  That's on record.
[00:25:42.132 --> 00:25:46.397]  They just throw them in a trash can, and a lot of people have been dug out of the trash by pro-lifers.
[00:25:46.397 --> 00:25:50.261]  There are scores of famous cases on record, and they're now young women.
[00:25:50.261 --> 00:25:54.165]  Some of them are, well, my age, after Roe v. Wade.
[00:25:54.165 --> 00:26:03.596]  I'm 34, 35 years old, and they get up and give speeches, and they have big wounds in them where the calipers and the knives cut into them, but they still survive.
[00:26:04.735 --> 00:26:09.599]  You know, they could just adopt these babies out of the CPS once they've kidnapped so many, but no.
[00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:14.703]  Let's just go ahead and kill it even though it's eight and a half months old, seven months old, eight months old.
[00:26:14.703 --> 00:26:17.205]  And that dovetails with an article I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:18.887]  I mentioned it.
[00:26:18.887 --> 00:26:25.412]  Judges took bribes to send children to privately owned juvenile detention centers.
[00:26:25.412 --> 00:26:26.673]  Millions of dollars.
[00:26:26.673 --> 00:26:28.474]  And, um, see, it's a business.
[00:26:29.366 --> 00:26:30.466]  This goes on everywhere.
[00:26:30.466 --> 00:26:34.847]  In fact, I just have the InfoWars version of this with a few paragraphs with our link to it.
[00:26:34.847 --> 00:26:36.067]  I want to cover this in the next segment.
[00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:38.568]  Will one of you guys print this for me?
[00:26:38.568 --> 00:26:40.268]  Just come get this story and print it right now.
[00:26:40.268 --> 00:26:41.188]  Thank you so much.
[00:26:41.188 --> 00:26:47.429]  I just printed from the original source, the Post-Gazette, because I only have part of it, just a few paragraphs of it there.
[00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:49.289]  I read it last night in entirety.
[00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:51.970]  It's somewhere here, but I can't find it.
[00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.430]  So we'll cover that coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.471]  Maybe you don't want to hear about all this, but you need to know
[00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:08.248]  That criminals have almost completely converted the upper echelons of federal, state, regional government, county and city government.
[00:27:08.248 --> 00:27:15.650]  And they're now finishing the phase of removing mid-level and low-level employees who are involved in crime.
[00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.370]  And soon they will have a complete tyranny in place.
[00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.951]  And then look out, because they're all hungry.
[00:27:21.951 --> 00:27:24.351]  They don't just want your money, your house, your land, your business.
[00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.412]  They want to dominate you.
[00:27:26.412 --> 00:27:27.292]  They're control freaks.
[00:27:28.257 --> 00:27:46.150]  You know, I put a private investigator on the local Access TV cable board and because they were trying to shut it down, it's the birthplace of Access three years ago, went to court, did a lot of other stuff, and the director was sent to Huntsville Prison for stealing $350-something thousand dollars.
[00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.492]  Now, we knew it was more like a million.
[00:27:48.492 --> 00:27:50.073]  We knew who the other people were.
[00:27:50.073 --> 00:27:56.938]  I even went into meetings as an investigator, bluffed board members, recorded them,
[00:27:58.131 --> 00:28:04.897]  You know, once we had enough evidence, I went in with classic cop tactics and said, we know you did this, now go ahead and tell us what you did.
[00:28:04.897 --> 00:28:06.799]  The city didn't want any of that.
[00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:09.421]  Passed the director.
[00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.883]  Then I got death threats, by the way.
[00:28:10.883 --> 00:28:14.186]  But that's a daily occurrence, no big deal.
[00:28:14.186 --> 00:28:19.150]  I had one guy come up and poke me in the chest at a telecommunications meeting and said, you better watch it or you're dead.
[00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.732]  And I just said, oh look, he just threatened me.
[00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:39.543]  I mean, that's who we're dealing with, and it went up into the telecommunications group, it went into the city, and they're just all in there in the city of Austin, stealing everywhere, and so because we had this guy red-handed, they sent him to prison.
[00:28:39.543 --> 00:28:42.924]  Red-handed!
[00:28:42.924 --> 00:28:46.225]  And they burned him, and he shot up, and he's about to get out of prison.
[00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:51.486]  I think he got like a ten-year sentence or something, but I think he's supposed to be out this year.
[00:28:53.757 --> 00:28:55.937]  So, I mean, don't tell me there's not corruption.
[00:28:55.937 --> 00:28:59.578]  All I've seen is corruption.
[00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:10.620]  And there's just thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of cases that are so horrible and so incredible that I have trouble even believing it.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.981]  Now, are all the police corrupt?
[00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:13.021]  Are all the bureaucrats corrupt?
[00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:14.261]  Are all the social workers corrupt?
[00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:15.041]  No.
[00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:18.102]  But their bosses, their directives, their mission is evil.
[00:29:19.773 --> 00:29:27.797]  And they've incrementally twisted them, a lot of decent men and women who are weak-minded, into carrying out evil and not recognizing what they're doing.
[00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:32.539]  So when we get back, we'll tell you what's happening to scores of babies.
[00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:38.201]  They kill around a million and a half babies a year, right here in the U.S.
[00:29:38.201 --> 00:29:42.243]  We're gonna cover this, so you can know what's going on.
[00:29:42.243 --> 00:29:46.185]  Then we're gonna talk about how they're kidnapping children for payoffs.
[00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:47.366]  Mafia payoffs.
[00:29:47.366 --> 00:29:47.846]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:52.237]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.237 --> 00:29:53.838]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.838 --> 00:30:01.384]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:02.165]  Attention.
[00:30:02.165 --> 00:30:05.207]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[00:30:12.272 --> 00:30:12.933]  Here is why.

[00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:26.926]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:29.046]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:30:29.046 --> 00:30:30.027]  this fall?
[00:30:30.027 --> 00:30:30.947]  Don't wait!

[00:31:02.438 --> 00:31:05.279]  A new world order.
[00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:09.581]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:10.163 --> 00:31:12.984]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:31:12.984 --> 00:31:15.766]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.766 --> 00:31:18.947]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:31:18.947 --> 00:31:26.271]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.298 --> 00:31:34.742]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.742 --> 00:31:38.604]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.604 --> 00:31:41.186]  Build America makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.186 --> 00:31:42.347]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.347 --> 00:31:43.127]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.127 --> 00:31:44.408]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.408 --> 00:31:45.389]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:46.550]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:31:55.255 --> 00:31:58.057]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:31:58.057 --> 00:31:59.178]  You have been warned.
[00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:08.348]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:32:08.348 --> 00:32:12.913]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:32:12.913 --> 00:32:17.597]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:32:17.597 --> 00:32:18.999]  It's a documented fact.
[00:32:19.879 --> 00:32:26.643]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:32:26.643 --> 00:32:38.728]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:32:38.728 --> 00:32:42.390]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.

[00:32:53.373 --> 00:32:53.613]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:32:53.613 --> 00:32:54.833]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[00:33:16.939 --> 00:33:21.184]  There's a lot of mind games the establishment plays on the public.
[00:33:21.184 --> 00:33:35.119]  First, they fool you to be into a socialized system, where even if you're not on welfare, or on the government dole, or have a government job, you know you're paying for it.
[00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:55.647]  And so they then sell the message through popular culture, through public schools, through college, that it's just the received, granted knowledge that it's true that more children is bad and that more children cost the public money when it's actually children that are our future.
[00:33:55.647 --> 00:34:05.095]  And if they had any hope in this Ponzi scheme of big government and social security and pensions, that we needed another baby boom.
[00:34:06.428 --> 00:34:08.590]  But that didn't happen.
[00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:15.975]  In the United States, if you take out the giant immigrant influx, it has about a 1.7, 1.8, depending on the year, population growth.
[00:34:15.975 --> 00:34:22.580]  That means for every two people, we lose, we lose more people each year.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:31.227]  A mother and a father, on average, have 1.7 children, and they don't replace themselves.
[00:34:35.282 --> 00:34:41.567]  And I listen to talk radio now for the last week and a half since that mother had eight babies.
[00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:43.248]  She already had a few children.
[00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:43.909]  She went in.
[00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:50.054]  She did a type of fertilization that's not in vitro.
[00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:54.417]  She did a type where they normally put five to eight embryos in.
[00:34:54.417 --> 00:34:55.398]  Most of them don't take.
[00:34:55.398 --> 00:35:02.143]  With her, she was very fertile, being an equatorial creature.
[00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:03.144]  And boom!
[00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:11.767]  They're now talking about how dare her, we've gotta pay for her, we've gotta, you know, we've gotta pay for her children, she's evil, she's bad.
[00:35:11.767 --> 00:35:19.193]  You know, whether it was a good decision or not for her to make when the family's middle class and the grandparents are paying for it, that doesn't matter.
[00:35:20.461 --> 00:35:23.162]  The point is they're selling the idea that children are bad.
[00:35:23.162 --> 00:35:30.826]  And simultaneously, hundreds of news articles on Fox TV and BBC about environmentalism and carbon footprint.
[00:35:30.826 --> 00:35:37.289]  We've got to get past the taboo of saying that we can't talk about population reduction.
[00:35:37.289 --> 00:35:38.230]  We've got to do it.
[00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.311]  We've got to get our numbers down.
[00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:45.693]  And the only group that listens to that is the educated population.
[00:35:45.693 --> 00:35:48.895]  Higher IQs on average, because there is a kernel of truth to it.
[00:35:50.049 --> 00:35:51.716]  At least in this current technological system.
[00:35:54.355 --> 00:36:03.460]  And so it is the people that don't care, the people that don't have high IQs, the people that don't have high educations, that do have the children.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.741]  And the establishment knew that.
[00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:23.631]  When they did the four-year report from 45 to 49 in England, the Royal Commission on Population, and then Kissinger's Memorandum 200, CIA, State Department, in 73, they know that globalist policies actually keep the third world de-industrialized, where they can never be industrialized.
[00:36:25.168 --> 00:36:28.089]  And that that actually causes a blooming of population.
[00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:48.792]  But they said they want to do that to hold them down industrially, so they can be controlled by the New World Order and their resources, and that they will then come in with soft kill weapons, sterilization, abortion, forced abortion, to reduce the third world response to being in starving squalor, to having more children.
[00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:51.833]  So these high and mighty globalists up there talking about how they want to save the earth all day,
[00:36:54.005 --> 00:37:04.029]  They just want to tax your carbon footprint that has nothing to do with the health of the earth, other than the fact that plants grow faster and are healthier if there is more carbon dioxide.
[00:37:04.029 --> 00:37:15.473]  The ocean has billions of times, depending on which study you look at, how many billions of times, all the carbon dioxide that is put out by humans.
[00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:18.474]  It's ridiculous.
[00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:20.295]  The ocean is made up of carbon dioxide.
[00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:24.215]  And you say, Alex, what does that have to do with abortions?
[00:37:24.215 --> 00:37:35.402]  Well, once they sell us that human life is a bad thing and that human life is a negative, life is no longer just cheap as it's been throughout history.
[00:37:35.402 --> 00:37:45.928]  It's a liability, and so we think of ourselves as bad, and we think of other humans as bad, and so we don't mind when we hear a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis are dead in the last six years almost.
[00:37:47.216 --> 00:37:51.139]  A million plus before that in the 14 years of siege.
[00:37:51.139 --> 00:38:00.286]  We don't care when we hear about old folks basically being chained down and euthanized with morphine all over the country as reported by the Wall Street Journal and other publications.
[00:38:00.286 --> 00:38:01.867]  It's on record.
[00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:02.688]  They can even talk.
[00:38:02.688 --> 00:38:03.829]  They beg for food and water.
[00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:05.009]  Please, honey, give me water.
[00:38:05.009 --> 00:38:06.170]  Nope, I'm sorry.
[00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:13.976]  The state's now your guardian and you signed those forms saying we were your guardian and you're going to die.
[00:38:13.976 --> 00:38:14.797]  We're going to dehydrate you.
[00:38:16.581 --> 00:38:19.623]  Be nicer just to put a bullet in their head.
[00:38:19.623 --> 00:38:24.867]  And so the point is there is a great evil already all around us.
[00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:29.511]  And there are thousands of people.
[00:38:29.511 --> 00:38:32.453]  In fact, I want to get some of these folks on the show.
[00:38:32.453 --> 00:38:33.894]  I've seen them in television interviews.
[00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:35.095]  I interviewed some years ago.
[00:38:37.461 --> 00:38:39.182]  I know one of them is a beautiful blonde lady.
[00:38:39.182 --> 00:38:39.863]  I forget her name.
[00:38:39.863 --> 00:38:41.884]  I interviewed her about a decade ago.
[00:38:41.884 --> 00:38:43.205]  In fact, send your tips.
[00:38:43.205 --> 00:38:45.147]  Help us remember all their names.
[00:38:45.147 --> 00:38:47.568]  I can do a Google search myself and find them.
[00:38:47.568 --> 00:38:54.794]  But who you recommend to joeyv at infowars.com and we'll have some of the abortion survivors on.
[00:38:54.794 --> 00:38:56.695]  There's thousands.
[00:38:56.695 --> 00:39:00.138]  Because pro-lifers know what's going on and they lurk around.
[00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:01.499]  That's what the media says.
[00:39:01.499 --> 00:39:04.061]  They lurk around late-term abortion
[00:39:05.097 --> 00:39:08.241]  Facilities that are in more than 40 states.
[00:39:08.241 --> 00:39:12.285]  And they've been arrested for pulling babies out of the trash cans.
[00:39:12.285 --> 00:39:16.250]  And they put up barbed wire fences around the dumpsters.
[00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.914]  But the pro-lifers learned how to throw a rug over the barbed wire and how to get over it.
[00:39:19.914 --> 00:39:21.476]  And they get caught up in stuff.
[00:39:21.476 --> 00:39:24.439]  And they dig around the trash every day when they can.
[00:39:24.439 --> 00:39:25.681]  And they get the dead babies out.
[00:39:27.028 --> 00:39:32.514]  And try to give them proper burials, or they try to bring media attention to it, that it's disrespectful to the human.
[00:39:32.514 --> 00:39:36.017]  Or, more often than not, they end up finding a live baby.
[00:39:36.017 --> 00:39:42.064]  Now a lot of times the baby's all cut up and sliced up or burned from the salts they put in to induce the abortion.
[00:39:42.064 --> 00:39:45.767]  And so the baby doesn't survive, and then the pro-lifers get in trouble.
[00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:46.989]  How dare you try to save a baby?
[00:39:48.678 --> 00:39:58.664]  Now, what they do with a partial birth abortion is they go ahead and pull the baby out on the table, and they stick a knife in the back of its head, and they stick a vacuum cleaner in and suck its brains out.
[00:39:58.664 --> 00:40:02.627]  A suction system, similar to what you have at the dentist, but more powerful.
[00:40:02.627 --> 00:40:07.550]  They use it to suck the saliva and detritus out of your mouth when they're cleaning your teeth or doing a root canal.
[00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:10.746]  And if you don't like to hear this, grow up.
[00:40:10.746 --> 00:40:12.507]  This is what we're doing to humanity.
[00:40:12.507 --> 00:40:20.651]  And when you do that to the weakest of us, old people, unborn babies, newborn babies, you better believe you're going to start having police brutality.
[00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.952]  You better believe they're going to start shooting people for no reason.
[00:40:22.952 --> 00:40:24.853]  You better believe they're going to start putting you in FEMA camps.
[00:40:25.313 --> 00:40:32.197]  Hitler did all this with abortions and infanticide and forced abortions and killing the infirm and getting rid of the old.
[00:40:32.197 --> 00:40:32.857]  You got it?
[00:40:32.857 --> 00:40:33.878]  It's called eugenics.
[00:40:33.878 --> 00:40:35.779]  It's the New World Order belief system.
[00:40:35.779 --> 00:40:36.919]  You're under it.
[00:40:36.919 --> 00:40:48.326]  The bioethics boards, these unelected medical courts, hand out death sentences every five seconds.
[00:40:48.326 --> 00:40:51.147]  But many times the babies don't make it.
[00:40:51.147 --> 00:40:52.168]  Now what happens is,
[00:40:55.131 --> 00:41:22.747]  There have been confirmed cases, one in Missouri a few years ago, where these abortuary people admit their satanist to the news, they admit it's a sacrifice when they kill the babies, the offices stink, there's blood everywhere, nurses that are new, it usually comes out when a new hire is there, who hasn't been in partial birth abortion, and who rationalized that it was just tissue, even though when the baby's a half inch long it's got fingerprints,
[00:41:25.205 --> 00:41:27.587]  A brain, a heart, a mind, a soul.
[00:41:27.587 --> 00:41:33.510]  They go in there and they walk into the back rooms and there's just babies gasping and dying.
[00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:40.535]  They put them in freezing rooms because a lot of times even these killers don't like having to suck the brains out.
[00:41:40.535 --> 00:41:42.116]  It kind of freaks them out.
[00:41:42.116 --> 00:41:43.177]  They let them die slow.
[00:41:43.177 --> 00:41:47.880]  That's kind of like the old people when they just tie them down and don't give them water with the dehydration.
[00:41:49.534 --> 00:41:56.897]  Everybody, when I talk about that, comes to mind Terri Schiavo, who they could debate whether she had, you know, he wouldn't let her brush her teeth for decades or whatever.
[00:41:56.897 --> 00:41:59.479]  You know, that could be debated, whether she was a vegetable or not.
[00:41:59.479 --> 00:42:04.741]  So they introduced dehydration to the world through her, knowing that for decades they'd been dehydrating people.
[00:42:04.741 --> 00:42:06.902]  Chained down, begging for water and food.
[00:42:06.902 --> 00:42:10.564]  On record, Wall Street Journal series.
[00:42:10.564 --> 00:42:12.425]  Remember that.
[00:42:12.425 --> 00:42:14.465]  And see how they introduce things to you.
[00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.266]  Learn their tactics.
[00:42:17.944 --> 00:42:21.748]  State may compensate juveniles sentenced by judges.
[00:42:21.748 --> 00:42:27.194]  I'm going to get to that in a minute, but first I wanted to get to this.
[00:42:27.194 --> 00:42:31.698]  Florida doctor investigated in badly botched abortion.
[00:42:31.698 --> 00:42:35.642]  This is not botched.
[00:42:35.642 --> 00:42:36.203]  18 and pregnant.
[00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:54.436]  Cycrolina Williams went to an abortion clinic outside Miami and paid $1,200 for Dr. Pierre Jean Jacques to terminate her 23-week pregnancy.
[00:42:54.436 --> 00:43:01.600]  Three days later, she sat in a reclining chair, medicated to dilate her cervix and otherwise get ready for the procedure.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:09.944]  But when the doctor didn't arrive in time, according to Williams and the Florida Department of Health, she went into labor and delivered the live baby girl.
[00:43:09.944 --> 00:43:10.144]  Now,
[00:43:12.918 --> 00:43:24.933]  I love how once the baby's born, it's a human being, or if somebody shoots a seven-month pregnant person and she loses the baby, they charge them with murder.
[00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:26.936]  This is the double-think world we live in.
[00:43:26.936 --> 00:43:28.538]  Now, the baby's born.
[00:43:28.538 --> 00:43:29.259]  It's time to die.
[00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:34.057]  Imagine, people think of Satan as killing a newborn baby.
[00:43:34.057 --> 00:43:38.779]  And it's so evil, it's so horrible, people can't even believe it goes on, though it does throughout history.
[00:43:38.779 --> 00:43:45.163]  But then, when we think about them chopping up a little baby after it's born, it's like, oh well, of course, that's very reasonable.
[00:43:45.163 --> 00:43:46.943]  See, you're engaged in double-think.
[00:43:46.943 --> 00:43:48.064]  You've been brainwashed, folks.
[00:43:48.064 --> 00:43:49.245]  You've got to break your conditioning.
[00:43:49.245 --> 00:43:50.726]  And then suddenly, you see it everywhere.
[00:43:50.726 --> 00:43:53.187]  You see the hypocrisy and the fraud.
[00:43:55.236 --> 00:44:00.617]  What Williams and the health department say happened next has shocked people on both sides of the abortion debate.
[00:44:00.617 --> 00:44:01.237]  No, it hasn't.
[00:44:01.237 --> 00:44:03.738]  This is what they do.
[00:44:03.738 --> 00:44:07.418]  One of the clinic's owners, who has no medical license, cut the infant's umbilical cord.
[00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:13.160]  Williams said the woman placed the baby in a plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.341]  And there wasn't a pro-lifer, because most of them are in jail, there to get it out of the trash.
[00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:19.401]  That's standard, folks.
[00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.881]  See, if the doctor would have been there, that'd have sucked the brains.
[00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:27.163]  Then it wouldn't have been a problem.
[00:44:27.163 --> 00:44:27.924]  Police recovered.
[00:44:27.924 --> 00:44:32.087]  The decomposing remains in a cardboard box a week later after getting anonymous tips.
[00:44:32.087 --> 00:44:32.947]  I don't care.
[00:44:32.947 --> 00:44:36.470]  See, somebody in the in the abortuary did have a problem with this.
[00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.271]  Well, you had a problem killing it when it was born.
[00:44:38.271 --> 00:44:39.713]  Why are you killing it five minutes before?
[00:44:39.713 --> 00:44:44.156]  You know, they induce labor and bring the baby out with its legs.
[00:44:44.156 --> 00:44:46.958]  And as soon as the head crest and they pull it out, they just hold it.
[00:44:46.958 --> 00:44:50.301]  They say as long as the baby's touching the woman in legalese.
[00:44:50.301 --> 00:44:51.802]  So they kill it, holding it up against her.
[00:44:53.996 --> 00:44:57.037]  Sorry, you don't want to hear this, but it's what's going on.
[00:44:57.037 --> 00:45:09.183]  I don't care what your politics are, what your morals are, this should not be happening in our community, said Tom Pinnacott, a Miami attorney representing Williams in a lawsuit against the doctor and the clinic owners.
[00:45:09.183 --> 00:45:12.524]  He's not a doctor, he's an executioner.
[00:45:12.524 --> 00:45:20.568]  The State Board of Medicine is to hear the doctor's case in Tampa on Friday and determine whether to strip his license.
[00:45:22.022 --> 00:45:27.504]  Well, what about the person that killed the baby by exposure?
[00:45:27.504 --> 00:45:31.706]  The State Attorney's Homicide Division is investigating, though no charges have been filed.
[00:45:31.706 --> 00:45:38.729]  Terry Chavez, a spokesman with the Miami-Dade County State's Attorney's Office, said this week that prosecutors were nearing a decision.
[00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:45.972]  You know, people rioted when that poor black guy got killed execution-style in the back, and then the cop beat him up after he'd shot him, because he got frustrated.
[00:45:45.972 --> 00:45:50.714]  And then they confiscated the videos, and then lied and said that the guy had attacked the cop, and then it turned out he hadn't.
[00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:51.514]  Videos got leaked.
[00:45:52.881 --> 00:45:54.642]  I wonder if folks will riot over this baby.
[00:45:54.642 --> 00:45:57.523]  No, they won't.
[00:45:57.523 --> 00:46:03.665]  The doctor's lawyer, Joseph Harrison, called the allegations at best misguided and incomplete.
[00:46:03.665 --> 00:46:07.867]  In an email to the Associated Press, he didn't provide details.
[00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:10.768]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:17.031]  The case has riled the anti-abortion community, which contends the clinic's actions constitute murder.
[00:46:17.031 --> 00:46:20.092]  The baby was just treated as a piece of garbage, said Tom.
[00:46:21.468 --> 00:46:23.450]  It really disturbs me, said Joni Steiner.
[00:46:46.405 --> 00:46:48.866]  How about we keep women from ripping babies out of their wombs?
[00:46:48.866 --> 00:46:49.206]  And by the way,
[00:47:07.765 --> 00:47:21.295]  Depending on the study, it gives you a 50 to 200 percent, depending on the trimester, increase in cervical, ovarian, and other forms of reproductive organ cancer when you have an abortion.
[00:47:21.295 --> 00:47:22.856]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[00:47:22.856 --> 00:47:27.919]  If the baby needs to die, your body will terminate.
[00:47:27.919 --> 00:47:35.625]  If things aren't going right, 99% of the time, if your body's in danger, the body will do it.
[00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:36.766]  So women just need to know.
[00:47:37.796 --> 00:47:41.017]  You've had abortions, that's a good chance of you getting cancer.
[00:47:41.017 --> 00:47:44.518]  It's also associated with breast cancer.
[00:47:44.518 --> 00:47:47.638]  Why don't you have the baby and adopt it?
[00:47:47.638 --> 00:47:53.020]  Hell, if you end up having the baby and keeping it, you'll have to fight CPS off anyways.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:57.561]  They're killing babies with one hand, and then they're CPSing them with another.
[00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:04.872]  Well, let's see, if they can't get the baby dead while it's in the womb, they want to get the kid on drugs, screw them up after they're out.
[00:48:04.872 --> 00:48:06.733]  And that's in their own documents.
[00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:09.734]  Little mindless scumbag social workers don't know that.
[00:48:09.734 --> 00:48:14.836]  You know, either they're pedophiles, or they just like the money, or they were beat up when they were kids and think everybody's their mommy and daddy.
[00:48:14.836 --> 00:48:17.037]  And they're out there paying them back.
[00:48:17.037 --> 00:48:17.918]  And it goes on and on.
[00:48:17.918 --> 00:48:21.359]  She came face to face with a human being, and that changed everything.
[00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.520]  The Department of Health accounts continues as follows.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.341]  Just before noon, she began to feel ill.
[00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:26.961]  The clinic contracted the doctor.
[00:48:26.961 --> 00:48:28.562]  Two hours later, she hadn't shown up.
[00:48:29.881 --> 00:48:30.941]  He hadn't shown up.
[00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.662]  Williams went into labor and delivered the baby.
[00:48:32.662 --> 00:48:35.103]  She came face-to-face with a human being.
[00:48:35.103 --> 00:48:37.243]  Yeah, and her instincts were completely bent.
[00:48:37.243 --> 00:48:39.684]  She wanted to keep maybe going out and partying and stuff.
[00:48:39.684 --> 00:48:41.325]  Why didn't you say, give me my baby?
[00:48:41.325 --> 00:48:44.166]  At least when you saw the baby and your instincts kicked in.
[00:48:44.166 --> 00:48:46.126]  But no, the New World Order was too powerful.
[00:48:46.126 --> 00:48:48.587]  She came face-to-face with a human being.
[00:48:48.587 --> 00:48:50.027]  And that changed everything.
[00:48:50.027 --> 00:48:51.668]  The complaint says one of the clinic owners
[00:48:53.171 --> 00:49:00.715]  Bella Kiss Gonzales came in and cut the umbilical cord with scissors and placed the baby in a plastic bag and the bag in the trash can.
[00:49:00.715 --> 00:49:04.737]  God, can you imagine being this Gonzales guy how horrible his life must be?
[00:49:04.737 --> 00:49:06.218]  I got news flash for everybody.
[00:49:06.218 --> 00:49:09.540]  You do reap what you sow and you get two judgments, folks.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.281]  You're going to be judged in this life.
[00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:16.415]  Everything bad I've done has come back on me, and everything good I've done has come back on me.
[00:49:16.415 --> 00:49:23.243]  And so, whereas I have an instinct and a spirit to want to be good and to love goodness, I still flip over and do bad things sometimes.
[00:49:23.243 --> 00:49:27.067]  And let me tell you, I fear God.
[00:49:27.067 --> 00:49:29.870]  Call it the spirit of the universe, whatever you want.
[00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.673]  The point is, you will be brought to justice.
[00:49:32.673 --> 00:49:33.875]  Make no mistake, Gonzalez.
[00:49:35.882 --> 00:49:40.224]  Gonzales is going to wonder why he gets cancer, why he has car wrecks, why he loses his family.
[00:49:40.224 --> 00:49:42.525]  He's going to wonder why his life is so unhappy.
[00:49:42.525 --> 00:49:44.746]  Because you are a demon.
[00:49:44.746 --> 00:49:46.826]  That's why.
[00:49:46.826 --> 00:49:48.987]  Because the universe doesn't like you.
[00:49:48.987 --> 00:49:54.750]  You understand that?
[00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.591]  Williams' lawsuit offers a cruder account.
[00:49:57.591 --> 00:50:03.213]  She says Gonzales knocked the baby from the recliner chair where she gave birth onto the floor.
[00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.597]  You hear that?
[00:50:08.597 --> 00:50:11.998]  You see, when they dehumanize something, they've got to be hateful to it.
[00:50:11.998 --> 00:50:17.820]  It's like, I've seen cops breaking abortion protesters' arms, and then they'll pull out a club and start going after them again.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.680]  It's like, oh, I broke your arm, and it kind of excites them.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.101]  I've got that in my martial law film.
[00:50:23.101 --> 00:50:26.642]  The baby's umbilical cord was not clamped, allowing her to bleed out.
[00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:33.441]  Gonzales scooped the baby, placenta and afterbath into a red plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.
[00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:36.025]  Just give me that baby, I'm throwing it on the ground.
[00:50:36.025 --> 00:50:41.014]  No working telephone can be found for Gonzales, an attorney who represented the clinic in the past and has not returned messages.
[00:50:43.755 --> 00:50:49.843]  Well, I think I want to say the baby could have survived and been adopted, but no, it had to die over a week in a trash can.
[00:50:49.843 --> 00:50:58.395]  Cockroaches fed on its flesh, and Satan smiled, and every psychopath got a little gleam in their eye as dark power flowed through them.
[00:51:01.218 --> 00:51:09.285]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:51:09.285 --> 00:51:10.906]  You need the Paclite.
[00:51:10.906 --> 00:51:19.134]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:51:19.134 --> 00:51:22.697]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:51:22.697 --> 00:51:27.521]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:51:27.521 --> 00:51:28.782]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:51:29.042 --> 00:51:33.883]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:51:33.883 --> 00:51:38.544]  The PackLite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:51:38.544 --> 00:51:45.526]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.

[00:51:54.248 --> 00:51:54.569]  4448.
[00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:58.334]  That's 877-715-4448.
[00:51:58.334 --> 00:52:07.328]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.328 --> 00:52:08.990]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:09.969 --> 00:52:11.510]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:12.311]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.311 --> 00:52:13.292]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:13.292 --> 00:52:14.673]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.673 --> 00:52:16.675]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:23.821]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.821 --> 00:52:24.302]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.302 --> 00:52:29.947]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:34.149]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.149 --> 00:52:36.950]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.521 --> 00:53:06.003]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[00:53:06.003 --> 00:53:07.844]  How will you feed your family?
[00:53:07.844 --> 00:53:15.166]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:53:15.166 --> 00:53:22.628]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[00:53:22.628 --> 00:53:26.190]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.
[00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.111]  We offer a complete range of seeds, including heirloom tomatoes, old-fashioned beans,
[00:53:30.111 --> 00:53:30.491]  I think so.
[00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:07.020]  This is not America, this is not the human soul.
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:16.064]  This is evil being downloaded by the population, as they become biological androids of the dark force.
[00:54:16.064 --> 00:54:25.528]  For many of us, we didn't go too far down the dark path, we turned back.
[00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:27.649]  But for many, they've gone completely over.
[00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:32.338]  You study psychopaths, you learn that they say they're not even alive.
[00:54:32.338 --> 00:54:34.079]  They don't have any emotions.
[00:54:34.079 --> 00:54:40.684]  The only time they feel like they're alive is when they're torturing and doing horrible things.
[00:54:40.684 --> 00:54:42.545]  When they're stealing money from the population.
[00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.126]  When they're bombing cities.
[00:54:44.126 --> 00:54:44.827]  When they're killing.
[00:54:44.827 --> 00:54:48.629]  And that's what these abortuaries are, or slaughterhouses.
[00:54:48.629 --> 00:54:49.450]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:56.255]  I'm going to go to them early with Bob Chapman for everybody that's holding you into any issue you wish.
[00:54:56.255 --> 00:54:57.656]  Here's some of the other stories I have.
[00:54:57.656 --> 00:54:58.957]  And again, I see these every day.
[00:55:00.461 --> 00:55:03.102]  This is out of the Post Gazette.
[00:55:03.102 --> 00:55:08.563]  State may compensate juvenile sentences by judge in Luzeran.
[00:55:08.563 --> 00:55:20.867]  State lawmakers are seeking ways to compensate children sent to detention centers by a pair of Luzeran County judges charged with taking kickbacks for sending juvenile defendants to facilities in Luzeran and Butler counties.
[00:55:20.867 --> 00:55:24.128]  State Judiciary Committee Chairman Stewart Greenleaf said Wednesday
[00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:31.632]  Said yesterday he would hold a hearing to find ways to help the children and their families.
[00:55:31.632 --> 00:55:37.554]  One option is to provide money for the Crime Victims Compensation Fund, said Mr. Greenleaf.
[00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:38.574]  Republican Montgomery.
[00:55:38.574 --> 00:55:46.577]  The hearing, which has not yet been scheduled, is at the request of Republican Senator Lisa Baker and John Grodner, whose districts include parts of the county.
[00:55:46.577 --> 00:55:52.459]  They made the request yesterday, the same day the third Luzerne County court official was arrested in an ongoing corruption probe.
[00:55:52.459 --> 00:55:54.259]  See, it's not total takeover yet.
[00:55:54.259 --> 00:55:55.940]  There's still good people in the system.
[00:55:57.110 --> 00:56:10.506]  Court Administrator William T. Sharkey Sr., 57, yesterday agreed to plead guilty to embezzling more than $70,000 in illegal gambling money seized by authorities between 1998 and 2008.
[00:56:10.506 --> 00:56:15.272]  Two other county court officials were charged last week with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.
[00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:15.972]  Judge Mark A.
[00:56:17.449 --> 00:56:22.212]  No charges have been filed against the person that made the payoffs.
[00:56:46.325 --> 00:56:48.447]  And what was it for?
[00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:54.254]  They would just take innocent children there for no reason and give them criminal convictions to send them into the system.
[00:56:54.254 --> 00:56:56.657]  And that goes on right here in Austin.
[00:56:56.657 --> 00:56:59.760]  People will be late to class three times in the government training camps.
[00:57:00.486 --> 00:57:17.153]  We've been covering this for more than 12 years, and they will call you in, they have portable buildings, so many courts they have, they have portable buildings, and a kangaroo judge, no jury, no due process, will scream at the parents and say, sign this form agreeing your child's on probation for three absences.
[00:57:17.153 --> 00:57:25.277]  Then, the next time they do anything wrong, of any, just the smallest thing, they are sent to juvenile, they're in the system, and then federal money flows.
[00:57:26.442 --> 00:57:32.823]  But the kickbacks go, because a lot of these homes and prisons and facilities are private, they then make payoffs.
[00:57:32.823 --> 00:57:38.704]  And we know what's going on here, and they just don't care.
[00:57:38.704 --> 00:57:41.765]  So, uh, APD, I ought to get Artie Cerveda in here.
[00:57:41.765 --> 00:57:44.125]  Hey, uh, police chief, I want you to do something about this.
[00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:46.846]  Oh, Alex, come on, that's not going on in Austin.
[00:57:46.846 --> 00:57:48.806]  Baloney.
[00:57:48.806 --> 00:57:52.067]  Bull.
[00:57:52.067 --> 00:57:54.407]  They got bounties on newborn babies they're kidnapping around here.
[00:58:00.086 --> 00:58:07.650]  And it goes on to say that her first time offender's son was expecting community service and a fine for pushing another boy last year.
[00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:18.956]  Instead, he was taken from the courtroom in shackles and brought to Camp Adams, where he was beaten by other teenagers, forced to wear ripped clothes, four sizes too big, and permitted visitors only twice a month for an hour, she said.
[00:58:18.956 --> 00:58:23.418]  And it goes on, kids who were truant were taken to the camp.
[00:58:23.418 --> 00:58:25.219]  This is a business, folks!
[00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:26.940]  Criminals run things.
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.861]  And a large percentage of them are pedophiles.
[00:58:30.117 --> 00:58:42.070]  It's like every youth commission facility in Texas was caught running rape rooms and the parking lots were filled with judges and police in there raping the kids.
[00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:43.492]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.643 --> 00:58:52.324]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.324 --> 00:58:55.305]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[00:58:55.305 --> 00:58:57.066]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.066 --> 00:59:00.027]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.027 --> 00:59:03.068]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.068 --> 00:59:07.790]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:09.151]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.151 --> 00:59:12.393]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.393 --> 00:59:19.377]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[00:59:53.382 --> 00:59:55.783]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.783 --> 01:00:05.148]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.148 --> 01:00:06.449]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:08.210]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.971]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:11.552]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.552 --> 01:00:12.492]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.492 --> 01:00:17.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:21.357]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:25.790]  We are back live now into hour number two.
[01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:32.357]  Angie Illuminati from Nevada, Marriott, New Jersey, Noel, California, Parker, Stan, and others.
[01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:37.393]  Patrick, your calls are coming up early in this hour.
[01:00:37.393 --> 01:00:39.254]  I'll be able to talk to myself and Bob Chapman.
[01:00:39.254 --> 01:00:40.794]  We'll get a chance to talk to you.
[01:00:40.794 --> 01:00:43.116]  Always appreciate your calls.
[01:00:43.116 --> 01:00:46.417]  But I want to go ahead and bring Bob Chapman up right now.
[01:00:46.417 --> 01:01:00.085]  Bob, a couple of months ago when the Madoff thing first broke, you said that you had intel from inside sources because you've had the biggest financial newsletter out there for decades and retired, brought it back, the biggest private gold and silver broker out there.
[01:01:00.985 --> 01:01:05.747]  Military intelligence, a lot of subscribers in the State Department and the Pentagon.
[01:01:05.747 --> 01:01:11.029]  And you said that you had inside intel that it was a AIPAC scam.
[01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:20.133]  They were laundering the money out through these admitted pro-Israel charities and that he was just the front man because their Ponzi scheme got out of control.
[01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:25.215]  That's why he's allowed to be on house arrest with his own security guards and even get his jewelry out and money out.
[01:01:26.977 --> 01:01:32.041]  Uh, and that it, uh, could be connected into the White House, and that's part of AIPAC buying off politicians.
[01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:44.331]  That is now starting to come out in the news, and now the FCC lawyer clams up on Madoff scandal, cites executive privilege, national security yesterday, and that dovetails with the whistleblower since 99.
[01:01:46.826 --> 01:01:53.150]  Going to them and saying he was concerned for his family and that basically he believed the SEC was covering up for Madoff.
[01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:56.512]  The media spins that and says that they were just dumb or that he's saying they were fools.
[01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.973]  No, I watched the testimony.
[01:01:57.973 --> 01:02:01.476]  He's saying they're involved and now they've declared national security.
[01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:04.878]  What's that sound like to you, Bob Chapman, the international forecaster?
[01:02:04.878 --> 01:02:07.079]  A giant cover-up.
[01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:08.320]  Same-o, same-o.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.261]  The last guy in there, he was bad.
[01:02:10.261 --> 01:02:12.163]  This one's just as bad.
[01:02:12.163 --> 01:02:14.864]  And, you know, we're just not going to get to the bottom of anything.
[01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:15.665]  It's like Congress
[01:02:16.451 --> 01:02:22.713]  Uh, the ones who aren't compromised are bought off and you get about 50 guys and gals in there who do the right thing and that's it.
[01:02:22.713 --> 01:02:24.694]  And we just have no place to go.
[01:02:24.694 --> 01:02:34.258]  It is the way, I said it was several weeks ago, and there's a whole bunch of people involved and, uh, nothing's going to come out.
[01:02:34.258 --> 01:02:40.520]  It is one of the great, and the figure's not 50, it's a hundred billion.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.201]  Oh, so incredible.
[01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:45.042]  And you know, they're going to catch some poor soul.
[01:02:46.115 --> 01:02:48.217]  Shoplifting and they give them six months.
[01:02:48.217 --> 01:02:49.178]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:02:49.178 --> 01:02:52.181]  These guys have been stealing billions, trillions.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:03:16.594]  Well, remember how when Mark Cuban was going to produce the new Loose Change film, it's now in the New York Times, what we said was confirmed, they called him and emailed him and said, we're going to file an SEC complaint, there's an SEC lawyer on you for this, and they did it for just selling some of his stock, a few hundred thousand dollars worth, and it was completely kosher, and now they've indicted him.
[01:03:16.594 --> 01:03:20.397]  So, we know what the SEC does, they go around harassing people that try to tell the truth.
[01:03:21.243 --> 01:03:23.445]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:03:23.445 --> 01:03:32.171]  They were harassing me since 1967, trying to put me out of business as a stockbroker.
[01:03:32.171 --> 01:03:35.874]  I mean, I went through the middle of Hades for years.
[01:03:35.874 --> 01:03:42.278]  I perpetually had three sets of auditors in my office trying to find some way to bag me.
[01:03:42.278 --> 01:03:45.981]  And then later, when they couldn't find anything, they started to threaten me.
[01:03:46.738 --> 01:03:50.821]  You know, if you don't cooperate, you're going to have a serious problem, this sort of thing.
[01:03:50.821 --> 01:03:55.444]  Yeah, you told me off... And then I get calls about, you know, if you keep it up, you ain't going to be around.
[01:03:55.444 --> 01:04:00.047]  You told me you had a White House official tell you, just give us money.
[01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:02.628]  Yes, that's true.
[01:04:02.628 --> 01:04:04.770]  So... That's absolutely true.
[01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:09.693]  So, the bureaucracy's there to go after real businesses, mainline people playing by the rules.
[01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:13.035]  The big boys are immune.
[01:04:13.035 --> 01:04:14.136]  Beyond.
[01:04:14.136 --> 01:04:16.257]  Two sets of jurisprudence.
[01:04:16.889 --> 01:04:21.733]  One for them and one for us.
[01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:25.756]  Well, I'll tell you, Bob, it just goes from bad to worse.
[01:04:25.756 --> 01:04:28.959]  But the good news is a lot of people are finally waking up.
[01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:30.960]  They're finally figuring it out.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.923]  And that's what this is all about, Alex.
[01:04:33.923 --> 01:04:38.246]  That's why you do what you do and I do what I do so hard.
[01:04:38.246 --> 01:04:43.290]  Because we've got to let the people know and we're reaching them all over the world.
[01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.353]  And we should be happy that we can do that.
[01:04:47.293 --> 01:04:55.352]  We can still do that, and I only wish there were others like us who would step in and do the same thing, because we need you badly.
[01:04:56.733 --> 01:04:57.634]  Stay there.
[01:04:57.634 --> 01:05:00.536]  Bob Chapman will talk about the latest developments in the economy and take your calls.
[01:05:18.991 --> 01:05:24.997]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:05:24.997 --> 01:05:28.420]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:33.084]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:05:33.084 --> 01:05:35.947]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[01:05:36.187 --> 01:05:39.288]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:05:39.288 --> 01:05:44.270]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the Solar Power Generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:48.611]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.452]  That's MySolarBackup.com today.
[01:05:50.452 --> 01:05:50.912]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:05:50.912 --> 01:05:51.012]  877-327-0365.
[01:05:51.012 --> 01:05:51.772]  Don't wait.
[01:05:51.772 --> 01:05:52.192]  Call today.
[01:06:00.802 --> 01:06:07.546]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:10.187]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.187 --> 01:06:11.748]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:11.748 --> 01:06:12.528]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.528 --> 01:06:13.389]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:13.389 --> 01:06:14.930]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.891]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:16.891 --> 01:06:24.055]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.055 --> 01:06:24.535]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.535 --> 01:06:30.178]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:30.878 --> 01:06:34.381]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:37.184]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:02.623 --> 01:07:04.024]  Time is more precious than money.
[01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:05.425]  You could be running out of time.
[01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:08.127]  I want to share something with you about your body.
[01:07:08.127 --> 01:07:09.928]  Quote, make no mistake about it.
[01:07:09.928 --> 01:07:13.030]  Parasites are the most toxic agents in the human body.
[01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:19.315]  They are one of the primary underlying causes of diseases and are the most basic cause of a compromised immune system.
[01:07:19.315 --> 01:07:21.136]  Dr. Hazel Parcells, PhD.
[01:07:21.818 --> 01:07:25.241]  Quote, we have a tremendous parasite problem right here in the U.S.
[01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.723]  It is just not being addressed.
[01:07:27.723 --> 01:07:34.708]  Dr. Peter Wyna, quote, in terms of numbers, there are more parasitic infections acquired in this country than in Africa.
[01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:39.712]  Dr. Frank Nova, Chief of the Laboratory for Parasitic Diseases of the National Institute of Health.
[01:07:39.712 --> 01:07:42.454]  As you can see, parasites are more dangerous than you think.
[01:07:42.454 --> 01:07:45.056]  For about a buck a day, you can rid yourself of all parasites.

[01:07:57.885 --> 01:07:58.665]  And P.S.
[01:07:58.665 --> 01:08:01.167]  I, uh, I really like it.
[01:08:01.167 --> 01:08:03.929]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.929 --> 01:08:06.691]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.498 --> 01:08:19.903]  Bob Chapman, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others would have big arguments, not tooting my horn, but six, eight, nine months ago I would say that I believe we were going to hit the depression in late 2009.
[01:08:19.903 --> 01:08:20.824]  I saw it coming in a year.
[01:08:23.464 --> 01:08:41.895]  year and a half they saw it for sure coming within two to three years and now Bob and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others are now revising that you know saying well look I mean we're just guaranteeing that it was gonna happen if things continue like this within three years it certainly could happen quicker so they're not wrong they were just being conservative
[01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:46.599]  Now, since we had you on a few weeks ago, it looks like it's accelerating even more, Bob.
[01:08:46.599 --> 01:08:49.422]  So, break down what's currently happening.
[01:08:49.422 --> 01:08:51.904]  This new bad bank they're creating.
[01:08:51.904 --> 01:09:02.314]  Dr. Stan Monteith made a great point yesterday that all they've done is claim, you know, shut down the economy, put out bad news, destroy confidence, then cut off lending, get
[01:09:03.135 --> 01:09:08.619]  Trillions and trillions of dollars in the U.S., tens of trillions globally out of the people's coffers.
[01:09:08.619 --> 01:09:16.544]  Then they told corporations and banks, you can buy now, you know, put your money in the Federal Reserve with interest.
[01:09:16.544 --> 01:09:21.387]  And then that made any available money flow into the central banks.
[01:09:21.387 --> 01:09:31.014]  So they literally hoard the money, loan out some of it, and then people give it right back to them to get interest, just ensuring there will be no money out there floating around.
[01:09:31.014 --> 01:09:32.415]  So this is all being done by design.
[01:09:32.415 --> 01:09:32.835]  Break it down.
[01:09:34.496 --> 01:09:37.959]  Well, I think you've broken it down pretty good.
[01:09:37.959 --> 01:09:42.302]  The other factors here are the stimulus package.
[01:09:42.302 --> 01:09:48.887]  And we don't know the exact form it's going to take yet, but it'll probably be passed next week.
[01:09:48.887 --> 01:09:54.491]  And the Republicans are just making like they're doing something about something, which they're really not.
[01:09:54.491 --> 01:10:01.436]  And that'll probably last three, six, maybe nine months, and it'll be over and they'll be back again.
[01:10:02.521 --> 01:10:06.203]  And they'll probably get a trillion dollars a year to keep it going.
[01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:08.484]  They're going to guarantee everybody's mortgage.
[01:10:08.484 --> 01:10:13.866]  They're going to extend mortgages to 50 and 60 and 70 years.
[01:10:13.866 --> 01:10:16.287]  And the government's going to guarantee them.
[01:10:16.287 --> 01:10:23.690]  The government is going to end up owning most real estate in the country, probably about half of it, when all is said and done.
[01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:30.093]  And the Federal Reserve and the
[01:10:31.117 --> 01:10:32.579]  Treasury have a real problem here.
[01:10:32.579 --> 01:10:34.580]  The problem is this.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.922]  They get interest rates down.
[01:10:36.922 --> 01:10:47.691]  They get the 2-year rate on Treasury bills down to 0.70 or 7 tenths of 1 percent.
[01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:50.573]  And they get the 10-year down to 216.
[01:10:50.573 --> 01:10:55.937]  Well, the 2-year is now 0.94, which is not good for them.
[01:10:55.937 --> 01:10:58.339]  And the 10-year is trading around 292.
[01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:00.943]  I don't
[01:11:18.087 --> 01:11:20.348]  Of funding that has to be done by the U.S.
[01:11:20.348 --> 01:11:20.989]  Treasury.
[01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:32.354]  So for inner bank lending, it's going to be a low interest rate, but for corporations, even big ones, airlines, 15-16%, for the general public, 10-15%.
[01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:41.579]  So again, a complete double set of standards, where for the globalists, they get cheap money, everybody else doesn't.
[01:11:41.579 --> 01:11:42.459]  That's right.
[01:11:42.459 --> 01:11:45.881]  And, well, even they're paying more, but not as much
[01:11:46.576 --> 01:11:54.940]  Is those who are not prime borrowers, and the people who are not prime, they can't get loans.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:59.262]  But anyway, going back, so they're going to raise this $2 trillion.
[01:11:59.262 --> 01:12:09.667]  And of course, even with all the money out there sloshing around in the world, that owns approximately $2 trillion worth of treasuries already.
[01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:12.249]  And the Chinese who have $1.72 trillion in treasuries, corporates,
[01:12:15.937 --> 01:12:19.479]  Uh, Fannie's and Freddie's and that sort of thing.
[01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:22.080]  Uh, they don't have the money to fund that.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.820]  So let me tell you what's going to happen.
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:32.564]  And I think secretly they've been doing this already, but of course it's a state secret and they're not going to tell you just like you just cited earlier in the program.
[01:12:32.564 --> 01:12:44.689]  And what they're doing is the treasury is printing up bonds and they're giving them to the Fed who in turn are creating money out of thin air.
[01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:55.062]  And giving it back to the Treasury, which the Treasury uses, which is immediate monetization, and it's very, very inflationary.
[01:12:55.062 --> 01:12:58.767]  And that's gonna start clicking in March, April, May.
[01:12:58.767 --> 01:13:02.612]  And by the end of the year, inflation's gonna fly.
[01:13:03.135 --> 01:13:06.777]  Stop, I don't want to interrupt, but I have to add this, and I want you to finish up with what you were saying.
[01:13:06.777 --> 01:13:13.360]  You keep saying you think they're doing it, and they are being totally secretive, but then separately, they'll also put out to their own people what they're doing.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:27.207]  The Washington Post and the New York Times, I don't think you missed it, because we've talked about it before, they admitted, what, a month and a half ago, that the Fed was already, quote, testing secretly, and preparing to issue its own bonds.
[01:13:27.207 --> 01:13:29.248]  So... That's true.
[01:13:29.248 --> 01:13:32.229]  The only thing is, they didn't say that they have done it.
[01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:35.616]  And of course they're doing it.
[01:13:35.616 --> 01:13:41.097]  And so it's going to get worse and worse, because that $2 trillion is a drop in the bucket.
[01:13:41.097 --> 01:13:45.118]  I mean, they're going to have all kinds of responsibilities coming after that.
[01:13:45.118 --> 01:13:55.481]  The $1.3 trillion minimum budget deficit, due 9-30-09, you know, it could be as high as $2-2.25 trillion.
[01:13:55.481 --> 01:14:01.083]  And that $1.3 trillion is just a little bit higher than I originally had.
[01:14:01.843 --> 01:14:05.705]  Projected that when people were talking about $500 billion.
[01:14:05.705 --> 01:14:06.505]  But let's be clear.
[01:14:06.505 --> 01:14:10.107]  No, I mean let's be clear though.
[01:14:10.107 --> 01:14:11.968]  They're being secret where the trillions are going.
[01:14:11.968 --> 01:14:15.830]  Well, it's going to their buddies so they can buy up more of the economy.
[01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.111]  That's right.
[01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:18.491]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:21.573]  Okay, you were getting into inflation when I interrupted you.
[01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:26.395]  Yeah, the inflation right now is running somewhere around 10%.
[01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:29.077]  And officially it's around 3%.
[01:14:29.077 --> 01:14:31.418]  You can't look at the core figures because they don't mean anything.
[01:14:32.348 --> 01:14:43.815]  And once this monetized debt starts hitting the economy, which I gave you the month, then inflation's going to take off again.
[01:14:43.815 --> 01:14:45.897]  And people are going to say, gee, how did that happen?
[01:14:45.897 --> 01:14:56.023]  Well, you know, this is a special area of economics that, you know, even people with masters really don't get involved in.
[01:14:56.023 --> 01:14:58.865]  It's an arcane area that is
[01:15:00.549 --> 01:15:04.173]  They teach very little about it at university.
[01:15:04.173 --> 01:15:15.405]  And so, the only way you learn this is by trudging through and working with it and at it for sometimes, sometimes years.
[01:15:15.405 --> 01:15:20.551]  I mean, if you went to stockbrokers and asked them all about what we're talking about here,
[01:15:21.301 --> 01:15:23.442]  Ninety-eight percent wouldn't know what I'm talking about.
[01:15:23.442 --> 01:15:41.609]  I was about to add, it's on record that all the major central banks and their public fronts, like they'll have a JPMorgan Chase and then it's got its Federal Reserve component, but its public component is the JPMorgan Chase, big banks like that, that they have special banking schools.
[01:15:41.609 --> 01:15:47.892]  Once you become a real executive, they send you off for six months and go, now this is how it really works.
[01:15:47.892 --> 01:15:48.392]  That's true.
[01:15:49.327 --> 01:15:53.508]  The military has the same thing, you know, War College and things like that.
[01:15:53.508 --> 01:15:58.449]  And of course, academically, it's getting your PhD.
[01:15:58.449 --> 01:15:59.589]  But you're right.
[01:15:59.589 --> 01:16:04.290]  And, you know, Stockbroke is a salesman.
[01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:08.510]  You know, I was there for 28 years.
[01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:17.712]  But what's going on today is not going to solve the problem, and they're extending this to some time frame.
[01:16:18.717 --> 01:16:29.440]  That they want, where they will allow deflation to take over from inflation, and the whole house of cards will come tumbling down.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:35.381]  At the same time, they're going to have their war well underway in the Middle East.
[01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:38.222]  And when the two are ready, that's when they'll do it.
[01:16:38.222 --> 01:16:45.223]  And the outcome, financially, will be all the currencies will collapse.
[01:16:45.223 --> 01:16:48.204]  And there'll be default, devaluation,
[01:16:49.665 --> 01:16:54.468]  Almost all of them will do dreadfully, there'll be a few that will do okay.
[01:16:54.468 --> 01:17:01.753]  And in the meantime, every single day, every single currency is devaluing against gold.
[01:17:01.753 --> 01:17:07.436]  I was about to say, Jim Rogers is, and he's been right generally, is saying exactly that.
[01:17:07.436 --> 01:17:15.001]  Every currency will implode in the next year or two, and then the final one to fall will be the yuan, but go ahead.
[01:17:15.001 --> 01:17:19.124]  Well, the yuan, I write about it for tomorrow's issue.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.242]  About the yawn getting weaker and then getting stronger.
[01:17:23.242 --> 01:17:27.284]  And you have to read through it to understand the play-by-play.
[01:17:27.284 --> 01:17:29.765]  It's like a baseball game, maybe.
[01:17:29.765 --> 01:17:34.568]  And this is the way it's going to happen, or probably will happen.
[01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:38.010]  China has 20 million people unemployed.
[01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:40.051]  They do have problems.
[01:17:40.051 --> 01:17:43.272]  It's all not sweet and light over there.
[01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:46.554]  And they're not going to be without their problems.
[01:17:46.554 --> 01:17:47.855]  The whole world's going to suffer.
[01:17:48.629 --> 01:18:05.081]  There's going to be no escaping it, and these elitists who believe that they can simultaneously drop all the currencies in the world, finally, because they're fiat and worthless, and then go to another currency, they're not going to get away with it.
[01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:11.826]  I get letters from people from every country in the world, practically, telling me, you're right, and we're not going to put up with it.
[01:18:11.826 --> 01:18:17.130]  And these representatives in our country, who are working with the Illuminati, we're not going to let them get away with it.
[01:18:18.228 --> 01:18:28.592]  So I expect, because I get letters like that, that there's probably going to be revolutions in half the countries in the world while there's a third world war going on.
[01:18:28.592 --> 01:18:31.954]  The final revolution against humanity.
[01:18:31.954 --> 01:18:41.978]  Knowing this, the elite in their own white papers know this, they're still going ahead with it and there's no discussions of prosecutions, there's no discussions of any of them getting in trouble.
[01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:46.280]  Instead, they're put on the news as our saviors.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:46.720]  That's right.
[01:18:47.955 --> 01:19:08.846]  What I thought was interesting was in the interview in Congress, the gentleman who had been trying to expose us for 10 years, and he said there, please, now all you people in the Russian mafia and all you drug dealers who lost your money, I'm the good guy here.
[01:19:08.846 --> 01:19:12.467]  I'm the guy that tried to save you, so don't come after me.
[01:19:12.467 --> 01:19:13.768]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:16.945]  And you know, what does Congress do?
[01:19:16.945 --> 01:19:18.546]  Zero.
[01:19:18.546 --> 01:19:27.149]  I mean, they don't want to go beyond that because they know who's involved.
[01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:31.791]  Yeah, he said some amazing things in the testimony and then none of it was on the news.
[01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:33.852]  Nope.
[01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:39.235]  They had a few clips of him, you know, making it look like the SEC were just buffoons.
[01:19:40.717 --> 01:19:47.822]  When really they're there to make sure real legitimate business doesn't go on, that everything is consolidated in the hands of the crime syndicate.
[01:19:47.822 --> 01:19:49.042]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[01:19:49.042 --> 01:19:50.263]  Your phone calls.
[01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:59.589]  Straight ahead and then more information from Bob on where he sees real estate implosion going, how bad the layoffs are going to get.
[01:19:59.589 --> 01:20:01.330]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.973]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:20:05.396 --> 01:20:11.279]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:11.279 --> 01:20:12.400]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.102]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:17.102 --> 01:20:30.349]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:11.078]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:23:11.078 --> 01:23:18.785]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[01:23:19.105 --> 01:23:31.890]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.
[01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:37.092]  Renaissance Charge offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and sizes of batteries.
[01:23:37.092 --> 01:23:42.254]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will ever use.
[01:23:42.614 --> 01:23:44.455]  Day after day Alone on a hill
[01:24:11.667 --> 01:24:27.240]  Wall Street and the International Banking Crime Syndicate, the banksters, have hijacked the world.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.004]  If the public protests, they stage another terror attack and menace us with their police.
[01:24:32.004 --> 01:24:34.767]  All the very police menacing the public are losing their pension funds.
[01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:39.647]  So whether you like it or not, you're with us, people in the government.
[01:24:39.647 --> 01:24:44.169]  You'll find that out soon enough if you haven't already.
[01:24:44.169 --> 01:24:50.733]  I want to go to the calls and get into layoffs and how you see this unwinding with Bob Chapman of the InternationalForecaster.com.
[01:24:50.733 --> 01:24:53.574]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:53.574 --> 01:24:55.736]  Anti-Illuminati calling from Nevada.
[01:24:55.736 --> 01:24:56.316]  You're on the air.
[01:24:56.316 --> 01:24:59.358]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:59.358 --> 01:25:03.420]  I want to talk to the brainwashed police and FBI agents.
[01:25:04.488 --> 01:25:12.675]  And all the other associated intelligence and law enforcement agencies like in the fusion centers and so forth.
[01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:17.299]  I want to expose some of the stuff that's going on with these guys.
[01:25:17.299 --> 01:25:29.670]  Okay, the 4911, there was the CEO and President of Images Technologies, Ian Drummond.
[01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:32.052]  He set up the company to
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:33.280]  This is
[01:25:52.919 --> 01:25:55.521]  He's on the board of directors of Vista 4 Corporation.
[01:25:55.521 --> 01:25:57.582]  Yeah, the police state chiefs.
[01:25:57.582 --> 01:26:00.645]  It's a revolving door just like the defense department, banking, everything.
[01:26:00.645 --> 01:26:06.550]  They sit over all the police state apparatus going in across the world and then make the money off of it.
[01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:09.812]  Yeah, let me explain something here.
[01:26:09.812 --> 01:26:14.116]  First of all, to any FBI agents that are listening to this, okay?
[01:26:14.116 --> 01:26:15.877]  You guys went and busted P-TECH in 2002, right?
[01:26:17.216 --> 01:26:17.736]  You know what?
[01:26:17.736 --> 01:26:21.599]  P-TECH actually physically still exists in the United States under a new company.
[01:26:21.599 --> 01:26:23.180]  They're called Intelligile.
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.101]  Why don't you go and bust them?
[01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:25.401]  Why?
[01:26:25.401 --> 01:26:26.802]  Because you'll get killed, won't you?
[01:26:26.802 --> 01:26:28.403]  You're too afraid, aren't you?
[01:26:28.403 --> 01:26:30.064]  Why don't you go after Intelligile?
[01:26:30.064 --> 01:26:36.628]  Now, the other thing I want to mention is the chief architect... Now, I'm going to just mention something.
[01:26:36.628 --> 01:26:42.171]  I'm going to prove how this... The key to this whole thing is this enterprise architecture.
[01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:45.773]  Their prison grid is an enterprise architecture-based system.
[01:26:46.323 --> 01:26:50.527]  It's tied into something called the Federated Global Information Grid.
[01:26:50.527 --> 01:26:54.950]  I've posted military documents on your website with absolute proof of this.
[01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:55.711]  Okay?
[01:26:55.711 --> 01:27:04.298]  VISA4 is a key company because they're global, and they're heavily in use by, like, pretty much all of law enforcement.
[01:27:04.298 --> 01:27:05.759]  They're used in the fusion centers.
[01:27:05.759 --> 01:27:12.084]  I know this specifically because I've seen... Yeah, it's all the data mining, tracking systems for the Kessler Society.
[01:27:12.084 --> 01:27:14.086]  You guys, you guys that are using this stuff,
[01:27:14.676 --> 01:27:19.157]  Buck Ravel ran death squads in the United States, okay?
[01:27:19.157 --> 01:27:22.598]  He had El Salvadorian people that came to the U.S.
[01:27:22.598 --> 01:27:23.658]  seeking asylum.
[01:27:23.658 --> 01:27:27.879]  He had them sent back to the death squads, and he even had death squads in Los Angeles, California.
[01:27:27.879 --> 01:27:35.520]  He had them raped and tortured a lady, and then she was pregnant with her, excuse me, she had a 16-year-old son.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.781]  They decapitated the son.
[01:27:37.781 --> 01:27:43.122]  The former Deputy Director of the FBI, this is the people you work for, you scumbags at the fusion centers.
[01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:44.349]  Okay?
[01:27:44.349 --> 01:27:58.653]  And this stuff is all AI stuff, like P-TECH, because if you go to Visifor's website, the chief architect and director of engineering, Andrei Korsakov, from Russia, okay?
[01:27:58.653 --> 01:28:01.273]  He's an expert in enterprise architecture.
[01:28:01.273 --> 01:28:03.674]  Now, this ties in also with the smart grid.
[01:28:03.674 --> 01:28:05.654]  The smart grid is based on the same thing.
[01:28:05.654 --> 01:28:07.735]  All these jobs Obama's going to give everybody,
[01:28:08.137 --> 01:28:14.701]  There are going to be jobs that are going to enslave the hell out of you, because your electric power grid is going to be dictated by an A.I.
[01:28:14.701 --> 01:28:16.723]  supercomputer, Jack.
[01:28:16.723 --> 01:28:17.203]  No, I know.
[01:28:17.203 --> 01:28:18.884]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:28:18.884 --> 01:28:20.725]  Well, it's not just people that get Obama jobs.
[01:28:20.725 --> 01:28:32.713]  It's going to be all of your thermostats in your house controlled, everything tracked, everything being... It's MIT designed a Pentagon grid, and they brag that it is an enslavement system.
[01:28:32.713 --> 01:28:34.334]  You want to comment on all he was just saying?
[01:28:34.334 --> 01:28:35.175]  Very interesting caller.
[01:28:39.101 --> 01:28:49.729]  Some of this is new to me, and it really is not my area of expertise, so I bow to the caller, because I don't know much about it.
[01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:52.211]  Yeah, and Anti-Illuminati, we had you on for about three or four minutes.
[01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:53.692]  It's just we've got to get to other callers.
[01:28:53.692 --> 01:28:55.473]  You say you've posted a lot of that.
[01:28:55.473 --> 01:28:58.796]  I think I've seen some of it in the PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[01:28:58.796 --> 01:29:03.379]  I should have asked him the name of the subpage so I could go look it up myself.
[01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:04.380]  I've run across it before.
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.761]  I guess Anti-Illuminati's gone, right?
[01:29:07.657 --> 01:29:08.197]  He's here.
[01:29:08.197 --> 01:29:12.100]  What's the posting name, so we can look it up?
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:13.040]  It's the title.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:18.104]  It says, New World Order Military Documents Revealed.
[01:29:18.104 --> 01:29:18.764]  It's pinned.
[01:29:18.764 --> 01:29:22.166]  It's pinned on the site.
[01:29:22.166 --> 01:29:25.228]  Alright, that's a Prison Planet forum.
[01:29:25.228 --> 01:29:27.069]  Let me add just another thing real quick.
[01:29:27.069 --> 01:29:28.370]  Go ahead.
[01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:30.772]  Okay, this thing that you're talking about with the bill with the school.
[01:29:31.716 --> 01:29:35.580]  All this stuff ties into that, and there's something else particularly interesting.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.982]  No, no, you're talking about federalizing security at schools.
[01:29:37.982 --> 01:29:42.546]  Yeah, this ties in with something else too that's going on in Virginia called RPAC-I.
[01:29:42.546 --> 01:29:44.628]  Yeah, no, these are federalization nodes.
[01:29:44.628 --> 01:29:46.930]  They're federalizing everything.
[01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:48.411]  Alright, we'll check it out.
[01:29:48.411 --> 01:29:48.772]  Thank you.
[01:29:48.772 --> 01:29:50.673]  I'm aware of what you're talking about, much of it.
[01:29:50.673 --> 01:29:51.194]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.194 --> 01:29:52.575]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.575 --> 01:29:55.117]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.117 --> 01:29:57.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:54.050]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:58.055]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:58.055 --> 01:30:59.978]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.788 --> 01:31:12.330]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:13.130]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:14.131]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:15.473]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.473 --> 01:31:17.495]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.495 --> 01:31:24.642]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.642 --> 01:31:25.122]  Some U.S.
[01:31:25.122 --> 01:31:30.788]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.468 --> 01:31:34.969]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.969 --> 01:31:37.770]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.667 --> 01:32:03.468]  The headlines are clear.
[01:32:03.468 --> 01:32:06.390]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:09.613]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:32:09.613 --> 01:32:11.354]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:32:11.354 --> 01:32:14.656]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:32:14.656 --> 01:32:17.418]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[01:32:17.418 --> 01:32:18.319]  To stay free.

[01:32:49.059 --> 01:32:51.180]  Their fancy packaging is not free.

[01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:57.362]  That's SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:32:57.362 --> 01:32:59.343]  A long-term food solution.
[01:32:59.343 --> 01:33:06.325]  If we're gonna get to everybody's calls, we have to hurry through them.
[01:33:06.325 --> 01:33:12.788]  But, uh, yes, we've told you they're federalizing the local preachers, the local schools, the local colleges, the local governments.
[01:33:14.167 --> 01:33:21.673]  We're doing urban warfare drills everywhere to train the public, to have military in the streets, and now they're announcing that that is indeed what it was all for.
[01:33:21.673 --> 01:33:23.834]  We were right.
[01:33:23.834 --> 01:33:24.675]  We were right about it all.
[01:33:24.675 --> 01:33:29.518]  And we're going to be right about the next chapter.
[01:33:29.518 --> 01:33:37.765]  So if we don't fight this successfully, and a lot of you get on your knees in a ditch when they put a bullet in your head and your family, just remember, that's what they do.
[01:33:37.765 --> 01:33:39.726]  That's what they came to do.
[01:33:39.726 --> 01:33:41.567]  They enjoy it.
[01:33:41.567 --> 01:33:43.409]  They're into corruption and evil and power.
[01:33:45.106 --> 01:33:51.270]  Because they've all stabbed and killed and fought with each other to get to the top.
[01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:57.735]  Bob Chapman, any comments about the control grid, the technological tracking control grid they've put in place?
[01:33:57.735 --> 01:34:04.760]  No, it's not something I'm that familiar with, so I leave it to the other experts.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.162]  Ione can be right about so many things.
[01:34:07.162 --> 01:34:08.102]  No, I hear you.
[01:34:08.102 --> 01:34:09.303]  Let's hurry through calls.
[01:34:09.303 --> 01:34:11.185]  I can't spend five minutes with the next caller.
[01:34:11.185 --> 01:34:12.886]  Bryant in New Jersey, go ahead.
[01:34:16.673 --> 01:34:19.115]  Okay, do you want to talk, Bryant?
[01:34:19.115 --> 01:34:21.077]  You don't want to, Bryant, New Jersey?
[01:34:21.077 --> 01:34:23.379]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:34:23.379 --> 01:34:24.600]  Hi, Alex.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:31.826]  I have a question about eugenics.
[01:34:31.826 --> 01:34:32.727]  Okay.
[01:34:32.727 --> 01:34:44.657]  I'm going to write a paper on my school, and I want to know what sources that you recommend
[01:34:46.041 --> 01:34:51.646]  Well, I would recommend one website to you because it's a bibliography for the film.
[01:34:51.646 --> 01:34:54.990]  Whatistheendgame.com.
[01:34:54.990 --> 01:35:03.898]  Whatistheendgame.com, and it is a two-hour film about the New World Order agenda, and all the eugenics section is cited.
[01:35:04.927 --> 01:35:10.009]  Okay, so years of research is all boiled down at whatistheendgame.com for free.
[01:35:10.009 --> 01:35:11.650]  No need to even get the film.
[01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:16.892]  You can just go read all the documents and news articles and video clips right there at whatistheendgame.com.
[01:35:16.892 --> 01:35:19.373]  It's all sourced.
[01:35:19.373 --> 01:35:21.234]  Okay, sounds good.
[01:35:21.234 --> 01:35:23.174]  Thank you, Bryant.
[01:35:23.174 --> 01:35:25.115]  Noelle in California, you're on the air.
[01:35:25.115 --> 01:35:27.376]  Hi, am I on the air finally?
[01:35:27.376 --> 01:35:28.036]  Yes, you are.
[01:35:28.036 --> 01:35:29.057]  Oh, wonderful.
[01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:29.937]  Alex, you're my hero.
[01:35:30.472 --> 01:35:37.113]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to get to all these points, but I was doing business with Midas and Mike Jones wants me to tell you my story.
[01:35:37.113 --> 01:35:40.714]  I was working for the media when the terrorist George W. Bush attacked this country.
[01:35:40.714 --> 01:35:45.075]  I know it was an inside job because I knew about it in the year 2000.
[01:35:45.075 --> 01:35:48.515]  I've been fired from my job because of it in the media.
[01:35:48.515 --> 01:35:50.856]  I've had somebody attack me.
[01:35:50.856 --> 01:35:52.416]  The police protected him.
[01:35:52.416 --> 01:35:59.257]  And I just got escorted off the plane in Southwest Airlines because they announced in the air that it's a cashless plane.
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:03.534]  And there's a whole bunch of other points, but I heard you say you can't spend that much.
[01:36:03.534 --> 01:36:04.374]  No, no.
[01:36:04.374 --> 01:36:09.278]  Listen, I flew back from a trip on Southwest Airlines, and it's a cashless plane.
[01:36:09.278 --> 01:36:10.719]  Everything is phasing that in.
[01:36:10.719 --> 01:36:12.600]  That goes into this whole control grid.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.621]  But send me an email with your name and story.
[01:36:14.621 --> 01:36:16.022]  Maybe we should have you on.
[01:36:16.022 --> 01:36:20.125]  I sent you a hard copy, actually, because my email was destroyed.
[01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:26.330]  I wrote a letter to a senator, and I went through a conspiracy, and it actually
[01:36:26.886 --> 01:36:31.289]  I stopped my computer and put in dark letters, do you really want to use this word?
[01:36:31.289 --> 01:36:32.810]  I gave you a box for yes or no.
[01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:37.013]  Okay, where were you working in the media on 9-11?
[01:36:37.013 --> 01:36:40.375]  I was working for Hall Communications, WCTY.
[01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:41.276]  I was the on-air DJ.
[01:36:41.276 --> 01:36:42.136]  I was the overnight DJ.
[01:36:42.136 --> 01:36:44.037]  I didn't even have that important of a job.
[01:36:44.037 --> 01:36:50.181]  But I found out that there was a place called Hippocrates Institute in West Palm Beach, Florida that had cures for disease.
[01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:52.443]  And they told me it was a conflict of interest.
[01:36:52.765 --> 01:37:00.670]  While we were begging people for money, please donate now, we had actual information that we were not reporting to people about how cures for disease are presented.
[01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:01.731]  Okay, how does that tie into 9-11?
[01:37:03.418 --> 01:37:09.400]  Well, because through wondering how these diabolical, how could people call it a conflict of interest, I found out about our satanic government.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.621]  And then, once I found out... Okay, well, do this, do this.
[01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:13.522]  Send me another letter then.
[01:37:13.522 --> 01:37:15.222]  I must have missed that.
[01:37:15.222 --> 01:37:17.443]  We miss a lot of things, but thank you for the call.
[01:37:17.443 --> 01:37:25.926]  We're going to go back to calls Stan and Martin and Patrick here in a moment, but Bob, let's get back in the economy while we have you here today.
[01:37:25.926 --> 01:37:26.846]  The callers are all over the map.
[01:37:26.846 --> 01:37:27.926]  We're going to go back to them in a moment.
[01:37:32.272 --> 01:37:42.394]  I just got word here in Austin that Dell just laid off around 20% of one of its divisions, and they're telling people they're going to lay off even more of their people.
[01:37:42.394 --> 01:37:45.054]  We see over a half a million layoffs a month.
[01:37:45.054 --> 01:37:49.895]  They're talking about it accelerating by a year end to a million a month.
[01:37:49.895 --> 01:37:53.536]  And, I mean, what do you do with fiat currency if there aren't even businesses to spend it in?
[01:37:53.536 --> 01:37:57.396]  I mean, how bad do you see this getting?
[01:37:57.396 --> 01:38:00.517]  Well, it'll be a minimum of five times worse than the Depression.
[01:38:01.483 --> 01:38:08.446]  And we have so many other things going on now that weren't going on then that are negative.
[01:38:08.446 --> 01:38:10.146]  And so it's going to be very, very tough.
[01:38:10.146 --> 01:38:19.670]  And that's why, you know, like you do, I tell people get food and weapons and filter and gold and silver coins.
[01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:20.830]  You're going to need them.
[01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:22.631]  I mean, this thing is going to go out of control.
[01:38:22.631 --> 01:38:26.012]  You're going to have revolutions going on, war going on.
[01:38:26.012 --> 01:38:30.494]  People are going to be drafted, men and women, shipped off to who knows where.
[01:38:31.235 --> 01:38:37.921]  Uh, if for no other reason, just to get them off the streets so that they won't be trying to overthrow the government.
[01:38:37.921 --> 01:38:44.726]  And so, you know, you put all these things together and you say, was it the depression like that?
[01:38:44.726 --> 01:38:46.007]  No, it wasn't.
[01:38:46.007 --> 01:38:48.309]  It was bad, but nothing like this.
[01:38:48.309 --> 01:38:52.192]  I mean, this is complete chaos and that is what's going to happen.
[01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:53.173]  It's going to be a lot worse.
[01:38:55.023 --> 01:39:02.330]  A lot of top economists are coming out and saying this is going to be worse than the Great Depression, and I go back over the same ground, but it's important.
[01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:08.516]  We had a pretty moral, on average, compared to today, population in the late 20s, 30s.
[01:39:08.516 --> 01:39:14.001]  Most people, 90%, were agrarian, living on the farm, and were somewhat self-sufficient.
[01:39:14.001 --> 01:39:16.623]  Now, less than 10% of people are self-sufficient.
[01:39:17.504 --> 01:39:20.685]  Ten percent are rural, but about half of those are self-sufficient.
[01:39:20.685 --> 01:39:28.488]  And then the five percent that are self-sufficient are going to be swarmed by people wanting their food, wanting their water, wanting them to take care of them.
[01:39:28.488 --> 01:39:38.872]  And we know the, quote, authorities in a drill in New Orleans with Katrina only went after the wealthy and middle-class homes that were, you know, that did have solar power, that did have food and water.
[01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:39.553]  Their mission
[01:39:40.313 --> 01:39:44.496]  Was to leave all the other people alone and to go in and get people's guns.
[01:39:44.496 --> 01:39:50.601]  So you don't just have the hordes of people to deal with and things completely break down, which I guess you're saying is going to happen.
[01:39:50.601 --> 01:39:55.044]  We're going to have the establishment, the troops coming for our guns.
[01:39:55.044 --> 01:40:01.689]  Well, I, you know, maybe through law enforcement, but the military is not going to do that.
[01:40:01.689 --> 01:40:07.554]  I am convinced from what I've heard talking to people who are in and people who are retired that
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.543]  They're not going to follow the dictates of the government.
[01:40:12.543 --> 01:40:26.512]  And, you know, I've said before on this program and others that law enforcement should take a long look at what they're told to do because once they commit themselves against the people, they're going to have a problem.
[01:40:26.512 --> 01:40:30.395]  And, you know, there's 450 million guns in the country.
[01:40:30.395 --> 01:40:34.357]  There's 40 million men who can carry them.
[01:40:34.357 --> 01:40:34.938]  We're looking at
[01:40:35.956 --> 01:40:40.279]  750,000 Vietnam veterans.
[01:40:40.279 --> 01:40:46.002]  And, you know, people will go back as far as I do into the late 40s and early 50s.
[01:40:46.002 --> 01:40:47.603]  And they're going to have their hands full.
[01:40:47.603 --> 01:40:50.204]  We're not going to back off.
[01:40:50.204 --> 01:40:56.488]  People are going to be out of their homes, their cars, their job, and they're going to be desperate.
[01:40:56.488 --> 01:41:00.210]  And so they are going to do things that they normally wouldn't do.
[01:41:00.210 --> 01:41:01.031]  Well, that's the issue.
[01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:03.852]  They're not giving us a choice, Bob.
[01:41:03.852 --> 01:41:04.613]  No, that's true.
[01:41:08.502 --> 01:41:09.262]  It's absolutely true.
[01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:30.335]  Are introducing legislation saying we are sovereign and what does it say?
[01:41:30.335 --> 01:41:32.597]  We will not let you pass any gun control laws.
[01:41:32.597 --> 01:41:34.539]  We will not let you pass hate crimes laws.
[01:41:34.539 --> 01:41:40.484]  We will not let you pass laws against the First Amendment, which US senators are announcing they are going to try to ban talk radio and free speech.
[01:41:40.484 --> 01:41:41.024]  I have the clip.
[01:41:41.024 --> 01:41:42.706]  If we have time, we'll play it next hour.
[01:41:43.686 --> 01:41:48.771]  They are saying and doing, and they're saying, we are not going to let people go to FEMA camps.
[01:41:48.771 --> 01:41:53.114]  We are ordering state police and local police under the state constitution.
[01:41:53.114 --> 01:41:59.480]  I mean, it's in here to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to not follow unconstitutional federal orders.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:08.507]  Those seeds we planted five years ago of fighting the Patriot Act and getting states to say no to it, I think it's sprouting and this is encouraging, Bob.
[01:42:08.507 --> 01:42:10.329]  It certainly is and it nullifies
[01:42:10.854 --> 01:42:12.115]  Part of what I just said.
[01:42:12.115 --> 01:42:19.419]  If the states were to do that, then law enforcement would do what they're supposed to do, and not listen to federal dictates.
[01:42:19.419 --> 01:42:23.362]  And that would be wonderful.
[01:42:23.362 --> 01:42:33.488]  Well, the only hope we've got with this banker-controlled implosion is for the states to stand up and have real order, and be representative of the people.
[01:42:33.488 --> 01:42:37.991]  Well, for the states to stand up and say, look, we're not going to put up with what you're doing anymore.
[01:42:38.983 --> 01:42:45.449]  And, you know, then I think you would see states arbitrarily and unilaterally leaving the Union.
[01:42:46.923 --> 01:42:48.704]  That's a possibility as well.
[01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:49.644]  And here's another issue.
[01:42:49.644 --> 01:42:51.905]  There's a whole bunch of states saying no.
[01:42:51.905 --> 01:42:56.687]  We know the Feds and the troops are trying to take over state houses and county courthouses.
[01:42:56.687 --> 01:42:57.528]  That's on record.
[01:42:57.528 --> 01:43:10.193]  And they admit under NORTHCOM, John Moore Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51, and now the Pentagon reorganization of a month and a half ago under Secretary of Defense Gates, that they are preparing to take over local government forcibly.
[01:43:10.193 --> 01:43:14.175]  They'll get away with that a few places, but they're not going to get away with it everywhere.
[01:43:14.175 --> 01:43:15.536]  It's going to turn into a shooting war.
[01:43:17.728 --> 01:43:19.768]  That's right.
[01:43:19.768 --> 01:43:21.769]  Well, be prepared and hope for the best.
[01:43:21.769 --> 01:43:23.809]  That's all you can do.
[01:43:23.809 --> 01:43:25.450]  You know, there's nothing more.
[01:43:25.450 --> 01:43:27.270]  We've lost Congress.
[01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:29.471]  The court system doesn't work.
[01:43:29.471 --> 01:43:32.031]  And the people who run government are evil.
[01:43:32.031 --> 01:43:40.713]  And the people who run Wall Street and banking and insurance companies and corporate America, many of them are evil as well.
[01:43:40.713 --> 01:43:42.313]  Well, it's a culture of corruption.
[01:43:42.313 --> 01:43:45.174]  You're weird if you're not corrupt in the system.
[01:43:45.174 --> 01:43:45.634]  That's right.
[01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:54.044]  Can you imagine that fellow trying for almost 10 years to get the SEC to act?
[01:43:54.044 --> 01:44:00.866]  I've been writing about the SEC for 35, 40 years, and how they protect Wall Street.
[01:44:00.866 --> 01:44:02.907]  That's what it's all about.
[01:44:02.907 --> 01:44:06.068]  They're not to protect the average investor.
[01:44:06.068 --> 01:44:11.149]  These people are as criminal as the people that we have in jails.
[01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:15.691]  And the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, is equal as bad.
[01:44:16.363 --> 01:44:27.052]  They stand by, along with the SEC, and watch the markets be manipulated by the government.
[01:44:27.052 --> 01:44:29.814]  Bob, timeframe.
[01:44:29.814 --> 01:44:35.799]  What is the United States currently on the trend it's following, the track it's on, 12 months from now?
[01:44:35.799 --> 01:44:41.204]  February 6th of 2010, what will this country look like?
[01:44:41.204 --> 01:44:43.666]  Deeper depression, because it's already started.
[01:44:45.099 --> 01:44:54.221]  I think that you will be seeing the second stimulus package, only this time it won't be $800 or $900 billion, it'll be $2 trillion.
[01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:59.822]  And this will, you know, they're trying to extend this until their timeline fits.
[01:44:59.822 --> 01:45:12.985]  It's too hard to give a future date, but that evolutionary process, you know, the U6 right now, unemployment is somewhere in the vicinity of around 15.5%.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.321]  Fifteen percent.
[01:45:16.321 --> 01:45:22.108]  That'll be over 20 percent, probably around 22 percent by the end of the year.
[01:45:22.108 --> 01:45:25.753]  And the following year, it'll be over 30 percent.
[01:45:25.753 --> 01:45:26.774]  That's where we're headed.
[01:45:27.096 --> 01:45:28.416]  Let's look at that.
[01:45:28.416 --> 01:45:32.337]  Europe has 20%, 21%, depending on the region, unemployment.
[01:45:32.337 --> 01:45:34.717]  They're having massive riots every day.
[01:45:34.717 --> 01:45:36.518]  The media's trying to keep it quiet.
[01:45:36.518 --> 01:45:38.938]  The Icelandic government's already fallen.
[01:45:38.938 --> 01:45:41.899]  But the news out of Europe is amazing.
[01:45:41.899 --> 01:45:42.959]  So, you're saying we're at 15%.
[01:45:42.959 --> 01:45:48.960]  Do you think America will follow the pattern and when we hit 20% unemployment, the riots will start?
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.300]  I think so.
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:53.320]  And that will be toward the end of the year and into next year.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:55.341]  And there won't be riots, there'll be demonstrations.
[01:45:55.341 --> 01:45:56.261]  Look, we want a job.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:00.081]  You know, we want to work, and so on and so forth.
[01:46:00.081 --> 01:46:14.425]  And then, of course, from time to time, that'll get out of hand, or the provocateurs will be sent in by the government to cause riots, so the government can try to use more control over the people.
[01:46:14.425 --> 01:46:18.027]  And say, well, look, all you people who are out of work, we've got a camp to send you to over here.
[01:46:18.027 --> 01:46:22.368]  At least you have a place to sleep and food, and we can indoctrinate you.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.802]  And now it has materialized.
[01:46:25.802 --> 01:46:28.724]  Now they are announcing the camps.
[01:46:28.724 --> 01:46:39.892]  And not only that, you know, all of the jobs, almost all the jobs from here on out for the next several years that are created are going to be U.S.
[01:46:39.892 --> 01:46:44.095]  government federal jobs.
[01:46:44.095 --> 01:46:47.037]  Federal jobs with fiat money?
[01:46:47.037 --> 01:46:48.258]  That's right.
[01:46:48.258 --> 01:46:52.281]  And of course inflation is going to go ballistic, and you know, you've got
[01:46:53.614 --> 01:46:56.997]  Uh, $902 or $210 gold.
[01:46:56.997 --> 01:46:59.279]  Gold is going over $3,000.
[01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:11.430]  And if you don't, if you have done what you're supposed to do about having that defensive insurance position at home, you've got to get more coins.
[01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:13.452]  You've got to get more gold.
[01:47:13.452 --> 01:47:15.433]  You've got to get more silver.
[01:47:15.433 --> 01:47:17.175]  It's the only thing that's going to be worth anything.
[01:47:20.416 --> 01:47:21.917]  Gold has been hovering around $9.20.
[01:47:21.917 --> 01:47:24.258]  It's right there today.
[01:47:24.258 --> 01:47:25.838]  How long can they keep it at that?
[01:47:25.838 --> 01:47:27.299]  Or will it just keep rising?
[01:47:27.299 --> 01:47:29.260]  Or will it correct again?
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:32.121]  Next week it's going to fly.
[01:47:32.121 --> 01:47:39.384]  And this exercise today, I'm a little surprised it came up about even to minus two on the day.
[01:47:39.384 --> 01:47:42.005]  And maybe Monday might be down a little bit.
[01:47:42.005 --> 01:47:46.087]  The rest of the week, it's going to attack $9.30 and break it.
[01:47:46.087 --> 01:47:47.407]  And $1,033 intraday.
[01:47:49.986 --> 01:47:51.727]  Whatever the high-end was up there, we'll say $1,020.
[01:47:51.727 --> 01:47:55.928]  It's going to get challenged.
[01:47:55.928 --> 01:48:11.714]  I mean, you know, being in gold and silver, you're not only going to keep your assets together and retain what value you have, but you may make an awful lot of money, of course, if you survive.
[01:48:16.861 --> 01:48:18.683]  Oh, Bob, I wish this wasn't happening.
[01:48:18.683 --> 01:48:20.705]  Let's take another call.
[01:48:20.705 --> 01:48:22.546]  Let's talk to Parker in Tennessee.
[01:48:22.546 --> 01:48:26.390]  Parker, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:27.470]  Parker dropped.
[01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:28.311]  Stan in Missouri.
[01:48:28.311 --> 01:48:30.073]  Go ahead, Stan.
[01:48:30.073 --> 01:48:31.834]  Hello, Alex and Bob.
[01:48:31.834 --> 01:48:34.256]  I've been listening to you guys talking about revolutions.
[01:48:34.256 --> 01:48:41.723]  Well, I believe that the New World Order wants these revolutions to happen because they've got to get the people around the globe in a state of panic to bring about their New World Order.
[01:48:42.793 --> 01:48:43.553]  Well, they've said that.
[01:48:43.553 --> 01:48:45.174]  Kissinger says it's an opportunity.
[01:48:45.174 --> 01:48:47.575]  Bob, I'm a product of the 1960s.
[01:48:47.575 --> 01:48:49.156]  I lived through the 1960s.
[01:48:49.156 --> 01:48:50.617]  I imagine Bob did, too.
[01:48:50.617 --> 01:48:55.680]  And I've seen what the American Communist Party tried to do to this country way back in the 60s.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:02.343]  They wanted an internal revolution that was started by the Weathermen, but it was also backed by the American Communist Party.
[01:49:03.968 --> 01:49:06.170]  Anybody that's a historian ought to know that.
[01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:08.871]  Well, that was a manufactured revolution.
[01:49:08.871 --> 01:49:11.573]  And they certainly are counting on people to resist.
[01:49:11.573 --> 01:49:12.774]  And that is part of their plan.
[01:49:12.774 --> 01:49:14.175]  I mean, Rahm Emanuel is on record.
[01:49:14.175 --> 01:49:14.775]  I have a video.
[01:49:14.775 --> 01:49:16.677]  He says, we love this crisis.
[01:49:16.677 --> 01:49:18.098]  We've got to take advantage of this.
[01:49:18.098 --> 01:49:19.319]  We can't waste this crisis.
[01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:21.160]  Bob Chapman?
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:23.141]  That's absolutely right.
[01:49:23.141 --> 01:49:25.503]  And they are going to.
[01:49:25.503 --> 01:49:33.188]  And we have to try, if we can, up until whatever point we can, to restrain ourselves and not get sucked into it.
[01:49:33.857 --> 01:49:37.880]  But there will come a time when you can't turn the other cheek anymore.
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:49.568]  And if Rahm Emanuel thinks that he is going to survive this thing, if it gets to that point that he desires, he's got another thought coming.
[01:49:49.568 --> 01:49:57.994]  Well, another problem we've got, and Bob well very well knows this himself, we have too many people that are socially dependent upon the government for some kind of assistance.
[01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:01.632]  Like the state of California is going broke, I understand, for welfare.
[01:50:01.632 --> 01:50:06.175]  Well, you've got 44 million people on Social Security, elderly and disabled.
[01:50:06.175 --> 01:50:09.357]  34 million people living in poverty, and I just figured that up on my calculator.
[01:50:09.357 --> 01:50:15.001]  That counts to 78 million people that are socially dependent upon the government.
[01:50:15.001 --> 01:50:20.345]  Well, actually, you know, that's an understatement, because there's the periphery of that.
[01:50:20.345 --> 01:50:22.547]  You've got children.
[01:50:22.547 --> 01:50:26.009]  You've got people who are not counted, such as illegal aliens.
[01:50:26.681 --> 01:50:30.687]  And so it's over one-third of the population is dependent.
[01:50:30.687 --> 01:50:35.774]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:35.774 --> 01:50:36.294]  All right.
[01:50:36.294 --> 01:50:37.176]  Thank you, Stan.
[01:50:37.176 --> 01:50:38.698]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:42.002]  That's exactly how they want us, domesticated, dependent on them.
[01:50:43.476 --> 01:50:46.799]  Final segment with Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:50:46.799 --> 01:50:51.244]  I'm Alex Jones, and don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, the new film is out.
[01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:52.445]  The Eye of the Phoenix.
[01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:54.527]  America's secret history revealed.
[01:50:54.527 --> 01:50:56.288]  Secrets of the dollar bill.
[01:50:56.288 --> 01:50:58.250]  And we have it discounted right now.
[01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:59.512]  And infullwars.com.
[01:50:59.512 --> 01:51:00.473]  Spread the word while we still can.
[01:51:01.397 --> 01:51:06.901]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:51:06.901 --> 01:51:07.701]  and the world.
[01:51:07.701 --> 01:51:11.564]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:18.068]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:51:18.068 --> 01:51:20.089]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:51:20.089 --> 01:51:28.034]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:51:28.294 --> 01:51:32.997]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:51:32.997 --> 01:51:38.821]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:51:38.821 --> 01:51:41.002]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:51:41.002 --> 01:51:43.244]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:51:43.584 --> 01:51:44.684]  Free of charge.

[01:51:53.146 --> 01:51:54.106]  Factory direct.

[01:51:56.347 --> 01:52:00.668]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:52:00.668 --> 01:52:06.389]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:52:06.389 --> 01:52:07.729]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:09.689]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:11.410]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[01:52:12.577 --> 01:52:16.739]  It finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:16.739 --> 01:52:25.262]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:25.646 --> 01:52:32.750]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:35.912]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:35.912 --> 01:52:41.676]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:41.676 --> 01:52:44.758]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:44.758 --> 01:52:52.002]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:52:54.554 --> 01:52:56.123]  This is the government-sponsored terror.
[01:52:56.123 --> 01:52:58.616]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:00.296 --> 01:53:03.538]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[01:53:03.538 --> 01:53:05.879]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:09.481]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:53:09.481 --> 01:53:10.422]  Be smart.
[01:53:10.422 --> 01:53:11.402]  Be safe.
[01:53:11.402 --> 01:53:13.603]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:54:10.094 --> 01:54:10.875]  Central Standard Time.
[01:54:10.875 --> 01:54:11.475]  We're here live.
[01:54:11.475 --> 01:54:12.897]  I'll be back this Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:12.897 --> 01:54:16.720]  with an abbreviated Sunday Final Edition.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.842]  Theinternationalforecaster.com is the website.

[01:54:30.552 --> 01:54:32.093]  Well, we'll get it here in a second.
[01:54:33.226 --> 01:54:38.487]  You kind of caught me a little off base here, but... I know, I always spring it on you there.
[01:54:38.487 --> 01:54:46.548]  Well, you know, we usually have Ted on, and, um, and so he usually has the number at his fingertips.
[01:54:46.548 --> 01:54:48.309]  And here I am stumbling around.
[01:54:48.309 --> 01:54:48.649]  Here we go.
[01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.709]  877-479-8178.
[01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.789]  877-479-8178.
[01:54:48.789 --> 01:54:50.129]  And that's toll free.
[01:55:01.673 --> 01:55:02.134]  All right.
[01:55:02.134 --> 01:55:10.355]  Just request a copy and you can go to the site TheInternationalForecaster.com and you can get one there as well.
[01:55:10.805 --> 01:55:19.568]  Bob, in closing here, and I may have time to jam in a call or two, maybe, I'm not sure, but in closing, there is an opportunity in this.
[01:55:19.568 --> 01:55:26.270]  You know, the globalists are giggling and smiling and have their body language is that they're having a great time, they love what they're doing to us.
[01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:31.292]  Obama, hope and change is now, do what I say, or it's going to be a catastrophe.
[01:55:31.292 --> 01:55:34.172]  He's gone back on everything he said he would do automatically.
[01:55:36.513 --> 01:55:37.393]  Or he's lied about it.
[01:55:37.393 --> 01:55:39.494]  He'll say, I'm getting rid of lobbyists and bring in lobbyists.
[01:55:39.494 --> 01:55:43.055]  Or he'll say, I'm capping salaries, which is bad enough.
[01:55:43.055 --> 01:55:46.416]  That just means selectively, but the big boys are immune.
[01:55:46.416 --> 01:55:47.777]  You know, the torture is going to continue.
[01:55:47.777 --> 01:55:50.157]  The secret arrest is going to continue.
[01:55:50.157 --> 01:55:57.480]  So this is also an opportunity for humanity if people will just stand up and say no and not go along with this.
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:01.161]  But if we acquiesce, they're going to get their new world order.
[01:56:01.161 --> 01:56:03.621]  Well, we got to keep on feeding the information.
[01:56:03.621 --> 01:56:05.182]  And when push comes to shove,
[01:56:05.697 --> 01:56:10.383]  They have to stand up on their high legs and say, no, we're not going to do that anymore.
[01:56:10.383 --> 01:56:11.545]  And it'll be up to them.
[01:56:11.545 --> 01:56:15.850]  Uh, I think half the population will stand up.
[01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:24.081]  And, uh, you know, when you, you get an empty belly and you don't have any place to sleep, um, you get to be a pretty ornery critter.
[01:56:26.758 --> 01:56:29.480]  Yeah, the tax laws are written where the big boys don't have to pay taxes.
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:30.620]  The general public does.
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:33.402]  And I even found a newspaper quote with Rockefeller saying that.
[01:56:33.402 --> 01:56:41.167]  He said, I don't pay any, I don't owe any income tax, but I send a small check each year because I'm such a good person.
[01:56:41.167 --> 01:56:44.209]  And he's worth just leveraged trillions.
[01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:46.350]  Just amazing.
[01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:48.051]  Let's take a final call here for you.
[01:56:48.051 --> 01:56:49.512]  Everybody else will get to you in the next hour.
[01:56:49.512 --> 01:56:51.053]  Martin in California.
[01:56:51.053 --> 01:56:52.094]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:56:52.094 --> 01:56:52.334]  Go ahead.
[01:56:53.447 --> 01:56:55.188]  Hey guys, how are you doing?
[01:56:55.188 --> 01:56:58.128]  Alex, thanks a lot for waking me up.
[01:56:58.128 --> 01:57:04.690]  I kind of got woken up late in the game in July, although I've been following a lot of this stuff for years.
[01:57:04.690 --> 01:57:09.532]  Bob, let me ask you a quick question, because I'm barely making it with my fiancée right now.
[01:57:09.532 --> 01:57:18.114]  I'm actually an out-of-work audio engineer, and she works, and we're getting by barely, but we have an opportunity to possibly buy a home.
[01:57:18.114 --> 01:57:20.375]  Is that even something we should even look at?
[01:57:21.375 --> 01:57:22.395]  Absolutely not.
[01:57:22.395 --> 01:57:26.236]  You keep on renting, at least for the next several years.
[01:57:26.236 --> 01:57:27.876]  Don't even let it get into your mind.
[01:57:27.876 --> 01:57:29.496]  Okay.
[01:57:29.496 --> 01:57:31.357]  That was my fear.
[01:57:31.357 --> 01:57:32.857]  I make my money sporadically.
[01:57:32.857 --> 01:57:43.919]  Right now, it looks like the payment would be less than my rent, but I don't want to get in that trap where she loses her job this next year or something happens and we're out the door.
[01:57:43.919 --> 01:57:46.239]  Yeah, when you're down to the internment camp.
[01:57:46.239 --> 01:57:47.940]  And when you are having good months,
[01:57:50.453 --> 01:57:54.157]  If you can, take some of that money and buy some gold and silver coins.
[01:57:54.157 --> 01:57:56.960]  Yeah, that's what we've been trying to do.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.583]  I've been eBaying like crazy.
[01:57:59.583 --> 01:58:07.892]  That's the only investment, and it's not 100%, but all the evidence shows, the only investment that is set to make gigantic profits.
[01:58:07.892 --> 01:58:08.152]  Is it 100%?
[01:58:08.152 --> 01:58:08.673]  No.
[01:58:08.673 --> 01:58:10.275]  If I told you that, I'd be made off.
[01:58:10.635 --> 01:58:16.740]  But look at where gold's gone from 280 five, six years ago to 920 today.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:20.382]  And so we've been right all along, because inflation means it will go up in value.
[01:58:20.382 --> 01:58:21.943]  The gold's not really worth more.
[01:58:21.943 --> 01:58:22.964]  The dollar's worth less.
[01:58:22.964 --> 01:58:29.549]  And Bob Chapman, I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today, and we'll talk to you again this same time next week.
[01:58:29.549 --> 01:58:30.570]  We'll see you, and thank you.
[01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:31.250]  Bye-bye.
[01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.731]  You bet.
[01:58:31.731 --> 01:58:32.211]  Lord willing.
[01:58:32.211 --> 01:58:34.213]  There goes our weekly guest.
[01:58:34.213 --> 01:58:36.795]  Pops in with his economic acumen.
[01:58:36.795 --> 01:58:39.116]  We'll be right back with Steve Watson and a lot more.
[01:58:39.116 --> 01:58:39.677]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.796 --> 01:58:45.398]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.398 --> 01:58:51.043]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.043 --> 01:58:51.664]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:51.664 --> 01:58:52.725]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.725 --> 01:58:57.489]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.489 --> 01:59:00.452]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.452 --> 01:59:03.495]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.495 --> 01:59:08.199]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.419 --> 01:59:09.541]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.541 --> 01:59:12.785]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.785 --> 01:59:19.795]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.795 --> 01:59:23.079]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.079 --> 01:59:23.340]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:25.743 --> 01:59:28.205]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:59:34.471 --> 01:59:38.235]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.235 --> 01:59:39.776]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:39.776 --> 01:59:40.217]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.217 --> 01:59:42.038]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.627 --> 01:59:56.009]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.009 --> 02:00:05.374]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.374 --> 02:00:06.675]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.675 --> 02:00:08.456]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.456 --> 02:00:10.217]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.217 --> 02:00:11.798]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.798 --> 02:00:13.339]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:17.541]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.541 --> 02:00:19.883]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:22.581]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.581 --> 02:00:28.243]  We are going live to simulcast the last hour and 52 minutes at T-minus 8 after.
[02:00:28.243 --> 02:00:36.726]  Steve Watson is going to be joining us, political degree, political scientist, webmaster for prisonplanet.com and fullwars.net.
[02:00:36.726 --> 02:00:42.548]  We're going to get into this bizarre, and amongst other things, blackjack
[02:00:43.602 --> 02:00:57.748]  A comic strip they've been putting in a major newspaper in England that shows the government staging nuclear attacks and setting up martial law and putting us in FEMA camps and setting up a North American Union and then turning the economy back on and we're all slaves.
[02:00:57.748 --> 02:01:04.091]  Why is the London Telegraph, one of the largest newspapers in the world, it's in the top five, reporting things like this?
[02:01:04.091 --> 02:01:04.631]  What does this mean?
[02:01:06.653 --> 02:01:13.598]  They've been asked over and over again in the three-part series what's going on, and they won't respond, so we'll talk about it with Steve Watson coming up.
[02:01:13.598 --> 02:01:17.380]  For the next three and a half minutes, I am joined by Ted Anderson.
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:26.767]  You just heard Bob Chapman talking about what a great investment silver and gold is, and it may go up, it may go down, but in the yearly trends, it's only going straight up.
[02:01:27.779 --> 02:01:34.065]  And I dearly believe in this investment, and Ted told you yesterday that he bought gold at the $830 level.
[02:01:34.065 --> 02:01:40.270]  It's now at $920, and then he's almost out of Sovereigns and Franks, excellent gold pieces.
[02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:42.352]  He is selling them at below spot.
[02:01:42.352 --> 02:01:47.596]  He is selling them at below what the market, what anybody else is doing.
[02:01:48.399 --> 02:01:50.439]  And he's doing this because he bought it when it was $830.
[02:01:50.439 --> 02:01:52.540]  This is the end, my friend.
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:59.361]  And he says if gold stays where it's at Monday, which it looks like it's going to keep going up, but if it even stays where it's at, he can't offer this anymore.
[02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:03.021]  So this is the very tail end of this, and it goes throughout the weekend.
[02:02:03.021 --> 02:02:17.504]  And again, he is the owner of the Genesis Network as well, so the tiny amount of profit he makes because he bought it when it was inexpensive, he passes all the savings on to you, goes back into the network, and Ted is radically expanding everything we do, including running national ads for The Creature from Jekyll Island book.
[02:02:18.868 --> 02:02:22.169]  To educate folks about the Federal Reserve, so that's certainly exciting.
[02:02:22.169 --> 02:02:24.450]  Ted, tell folks the offer today.
[02:02:24.450 --> 02:02:28.312]  Yeah, right now what we're doing is we still have the franc.
[02:02:28.312 --> 02:02:34.314]  We have some of those available still at that $217 level, and the British Sovereign is at $265.
[02:02:34.314 --> 02:02:43.777]  I mentioned to you last time, going out in the marketplace, that $920 level, I'm looking at $230 on the franc, and the British Sovereign is $280.
[02:02:48.317 --> 02:02:51.959]  So right now at this particular time, that is a big discount.
[02:02:51.959 --> 02:02:55.861]  Every now and then I'll have somebody calling, wait a minute, you're selling stuff for less than spot.
[02:02:55.861 --> 02:02:56.901]  What does that mean?
[02:02:56.901 --> 02:03:05.586]  What that means is when the spot is lower and I lock in on a coin and the spot price goes up, I'm heavily discounted in the current market.
[02:03:05.586 --> 02:03:12.469]  And sometimes that coin, you know, when you divide it down, you can say, well, it's more than spot, but the coins all trade for over spot.
[02:03:12.469 --> 02:03:14.050]  That's the way they are.
[02:03:14.050 --> 02:03:15.771]  Right now that is discounted.
[02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:18.123]  You know, it's coming up on $30 a coin.
[02:03:20.024 --> 02:03:21.685]  And they're fractional gold pieces.
[02:03:21.685 --> 02:03:26.846]  I mean, I've been... And again, most people are sold out and you're even getting close.
[02:03:26.846 --> 02:03:29.647]  So folks, 800-686-2237.
[02:03:29.647 --> 02:03:33.228]  Now the broker's going to be there throughout the weekend till midnight every night.
[02:03:33.228 --> 02:03:33.908]  800-686-2237.
[02:03:33.908 --> 02:03:39.550]  And this runs till Sunday night at midnight, Ted?
[02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:41.971]  Yeah, it runs right through, clean through Sunday night.
[02:03:41.971 --> 02:03:48.193]  Even if I sell more than I have, I will guarantee the price that I'm talking today.
[02:03:48.193 --> 02:03:49.493]  But you look around.
[02:03:50.037 --> 02:03:50.677]  Check it out!
[02:03:50.677 --> 02:03:58.041]  You're not going to find... Alex, I called at least five or six new possible sources for gold and silver today.
[02:03:58.041 --> 02:04:00.122]  They're all telling me four to six weeks out.
[02:04:00.475 --> 02:04:02.115]  They can't get the stuff.
[02:04:02.115 --> 02:04:05.116]  British sovereigns are almost impossible now to get.
[02:04:05.116 --> 02:04:06.216]  Let's explain this.
[02:04:06.216 --> 02:04:09.137]  Not only is it hard to get, you're getting a great price.
[02:04:09.137 --> 02:04:12.078]  And folks, they are imploding the economy.
[02:04:12.078 --> 02:04:13.938]  They are going to shred the dollar.
[02:04:13.938 --> 02:04:17.079]  It is insane not to physically hold these assets.
[02:04:17.079 --> 02:04:17.459]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:17.459 --> 02:04:23.120]  Do you have anything else other than the great sovereigns and francs?
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.721]  Yeah, right now silver, right?
[02:04:25.721 --> 02:04:28.402]  That's the shortage right now on the marketplace for sure.
[02:04:28.402 --> 02:04:30.022]  And I do have those mercury dimes.
[02:04:30.504 --> 02:04:37.765]  Silver right now is in a position where you're going to find that we're going to be just like it was about a year ago where you can't even get the stuff.
[02:04:37.765 --> 02:04:44.526]  Right now, I'd really recommend taking a look at silver and those mercury dimes that we're carrying right now is more than light.
[02:04:44.526 --> 02:04:46.187]  I don't know how long I can hold on those.
[02:04:46.187 --> 02:04:48.327]  I will do it through this weekend.
[02:04:48.327 --> 02:04:50.527]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:50.527 --> 02:04:52.208]  Protect yourselves, folks.
[02:04:52.208 --> 02:04:55.988]  The deals don't get any better than this.
[02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:56.108]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:56.108 --> 02:04:57.109]  Ted, thank you.
[02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:58.169]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:04:58.169 --> 02:04:59.729]  And thanks to all the brokers that stay late.
[02:05:01.061 --> 02:05:05.965]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:13.411]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[02:05:13.411 --> 02:05:15.032]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:05:15.032 --> 02:05:19.195]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[02:05:19.195 --> 02:05:23.018]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[02:05:23.018 --> 02:05:27.501]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[02:05:27.501 --> 02:05:30.964]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared to
[02:05:30.984 --> 02:05:32.385]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.159 --> 02:06:14.311]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:06:14.311 --> 02:06:21.077]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:06:21.417 --> 02:06:25.358]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:06:25.358 --> 02:06:28.779]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:06:28.779 --> 02:06:30.539]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:06:30.539 --> 02:06:36.660]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:08:00.996 --> 02:08:06.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:13.365]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.365 --> 02:08:15.426]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:15.426 --> 02:08:17.247]  Locked and loaded.
[02:08:17.247 --> 02:08:19.809]  We are now simulcasting for the last hour and 52 minutes.
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:24.782]  at PrisonPlanet.TV for all of the viewers there.
[02:08:24.782 --> 02:08:28.263]  I want to thank them for their ongoing support.
[02:08:28.263 --> 02:08:36.406]  Don't forget that we then post the archive of the TV segment of the radio show every day at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV for the members
[02:08:38.872 --> 02:08:46.017]  And then, folks, we want you to burn it to disk, give it out to people in your area, and spread the word.
[02:08:46.017 --> 02:08:50.280]  It is your support of PrisonPlanet.tv that makes so much of what we do here possible.
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:09:01.027]  That's why we're building a big web 2.0, PrisonPlanet.tv, with a whole bunch of great features, and easier to find the 3,000 plus pieces of media, all of my films, and so much more that are there.
[02:09:01.027 --> 02:09:02.768]  So that's all ongoing.
[02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:07.392]  Right now I've got meetings about that today, and web designers, and web consultants, and back-end IT people.
[02:09:07.972 --> 02:09:09.412]  Got flying in from Chicago.
[02:09:09.412 --> 02:09:12.293]  Got to get a lot done here.
[02:09:12.293 --> 02:09:23.496]  So we are definitely expanding PrisonPlanet.TV and we've extended that year-end special, because I forgot about it, that we still are offering it, five plus months free, and that goes until Tuesday morning.
[02:09:23.496 --> 02:09:27.917]  Five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.TV, so check it out.
[02:09:30.677 --> 02:09:33.559]  We're going to spend about 20-30 minutes of this interview with Steve.
[02:09:33.559 --> 02:09:35.341]  We're going to have some other issues with him.
[02:09:35.341 --> 02:09:40.685]  Joining us from London, England, he runs with his brother Paul Watson.
[02:09:40.685 --> 02:09:49.552]  These are contractors out there running PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.net.
[02:09:49.552 --> 02:09:54.716]  And he has been writing this series about Blackjack.
[02:09:54.716 --> 02:09:55.657]  It is the name of a
[02:09:57.188 --> 02:10:01.211]  Cartoon, you could call it, but it's only posterized photos.
[02:10:01.211 --> 02:10:03.773]  And we'll start putting those on screen.
[02:10:03.773 --> 02:10:19.866]  Where somebody nukes major cities in England and the United States, and then martial law is brought in, people are put in FEMA camps, the Union of North America, UNE is set up, basically everything the globalists are actually planning and what they say in their own policy reports.
[02:10:22.116 --> 02:10:24.958]  In the first part of the series, though, it doesn't let you know it's the government.
[02:10:24.958 --> 02:10:27.300]  It's an MI6 intelligence report you see.
[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:30.423]  We'll put that first part up on screen.
[02:10:30.423 --> 02:10:33.625]  And they're talking about MI6 things terrorists are about to strike.
[02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:39.930]  But then later you learn that it's really basically a bunch of guys in a CENTCOM-type command center.
[02:10:39.930 --> 02:10:41.691]  Is this a warning from the London Telegraph?
[02:10:42.612 --> 02:10:45.014]  Are they trying to warn the world what's happening?
[02:10:45.014 --> 02:10:46.955]  But they're establishment owned.
[02:10:46.955 --> 02:10:49.997]  Why did Fox TV, News Corp put out The Lone Gunman?
[02:10:49.997 --> 02:10:56.861]  Where the government hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan six months before the real attacks.
[02:10:56.861 --> 02:10:58.182]  They even use a drill.
[02:10:59.373 --> 02:11:06.297]  Of hijacked jets flying into buildings to basically make everybody stand down.
[02:11:06.297 --> 02:11:07.958]  That's exactly what happened in real life.
[02:11:07.958 --> 02:11:10.159]  And they do this over and over again.
[02:11:10.159 --> 02:11:18.544]  They came out with a Tom Clancy video game eight years ago where the United States, through the Georgians, sneak attacks South Osetia.
[02:11:18.544 --> 02:11:20.105]  I mean, what is this?
[02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:20.646]  Is it good?
[02:11:20.646 --> 02:11:21.826]  Is it a warning?
[02:11:21.826 --> 02:11:26.449]  Why won't the paper, after tons of inquiries, tell people what is going on?
[02:11:26.449 --> 02:11:27.930]  And can we put that on screen, guys?
[02:11:29.226 --> 02:11:30.887]  We're working on that?
[02:11:30.887 --> 02:11:33.869]  Good, because I want to put some of the comic images.
[02:11:33.869 --> 02:11:34.369]  There it is.
[02:11:34.369 --> 02:11:38.252]  MI5 report warns government of imminent terrorist attack.
[02:11:38.252 --> 02:11:40.393]  June 20th, 2 p.m.
[02:11:40.393 --> 02:11:45.357]  A coalition of homegrown extremists, Islamist and Christian doomsday cultists.
[02:11:45.357 --> 02:11:46.998]  See, they're going to train everybody.
[02:11:48.479 --> 02:11:55.089]  See, the London Telegraph couldn't come out and say, Christians doomsday cultists is what the anti-terror system is for.
[02:11:55.089 --> 02:12:03.441]  We're going to swing this giant anti-terror system and the drug war system onto the American people, onto the British people and say that everybody's a white Al Qaeda.
[02:12:03.441 --> 02:12:04.542]  Though some media is doing that.
[02:12:05.043 --> 02:12:07.945]  This is a way to just get this into the nomenclature and the idea.
[02:12:07.945 --> 02:12:13.069]  Such a strike may take place from a biological, chemical, or even a nuclear attack in one of our main population centers.
[02:12:13.069 --> 02:12:14.150]  And it goes on.
[02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:17.052]  Let's go ahead and bring up Steve Watson.
[02:12:17.052 --> 02:12:21.516]  Human intelligence indicates this group is ready to strike at any time.
[02:12:21.516 --> 02:12:25.199]  In the event of such an attack, the likelihood of many thousands of casualties is high.
[02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:28.761]  So it teaches you that Prime Minister takes statement on threat.
[02:12:28.761 --> 02:12:29.382]  Breaking news.
[02:12:29.382 --> 02:12:31.904]  Prime Minister addresses House of Threat.
[02:12:31.904 --> 02:12:34.686]  And they show Gordon Brown, the current
[02:12:36.974 --> 02:12:37.554]  Prime Minister.
[02:12:37.554 --> 02:12:40.435]  They have this obsession with scripting.
[02:12:40.435 --> 02:12:43.416]  They had a FX show, Oil Storm.
[02:12:43.416 --> 02:12:54.420]  With the mayor of New Orleans himself, in the film, where the hurricane goes in, blows over, floods Lake Pontchartrain, breaks things, and exactly what happened then happens.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:56.181]  That aired a year before Katrina.
[02:12:56.181 --> 02:12:58.481]  Again, there's hundreds of examples.
[02:12:58.481 --> 02:13:00.182]  Steve Watson, what do you make of all this?
[02:13:00.182 --> 02:13:05.764]  Then we'll start going step-by-step through the three-part series in the international publication.
[02:13:07.697 --> 02:13:08.378]  Oh, hello Alex.
[02:13:08.378 --> 02:13:10.319]  It's good to be back on again.
[02:13:10.319 --> 02:13:34.979]  Yeah, basically, um... Well, if we want to start with what we make of it, then, um... That's pretty clear, I think, from the articles we wrote, but... Basically... Um... It's the... Well... We don't want to tell people what to think, but it's either... It's either clearly a propaganda piece, or it's... Some... Somebody who's... Somehow...
[02:13:36.172 --> 02:13:42.714]  An insider has been able to get this into a major British newspaper.
[02:13:42.714 --> 02:13:46.436]  But, I mean, we've got to be clear about it.
[02:13:46.436 --> 02:13:48.276]  It's not 1984 by George Orwell.
[02:13:48.276 --> 02:13:50.057]  It's not an artistic masterpiece.
[02:13:50.057 --> 02:14:05.042]  It's basically, to begin with, it was a set of poorly photoshopped images just thrown together of major cities being nuked, basically.
[02:14:05.603 --> 02:14:17.631]  And, um, it's very difficult to understand why that was able to get into a major, one of the biggest newspapers in the world, essentially.
[02:14:17.631 --> 02:14:30.499]  Um, but there's a, there's a series of commenters on the articles who have started to question why we're even questioning it.
[02:14:30.499 --> 02:14:32.821]  Saying, you know, it's good, what's wrong with it?
[02:14:32.821 --> 02:14:33.461]  And saying that it's
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:39.324]  It's suspicious that we're even covering it, and even accusing us of being fear-mongering.
[02:14:39.324 --> 02:14:46.688]  But basically, we're not the ones posting poorly photoshopped images of cities being nuked.
[02:14:46.688 --> 02:14:47.609]  Well, let's explain.
[02:14:47.609 --> 02:14:48.970]  I mean, I know why they're doing this.
[02:14:48.970 --> 02:14:51.351]  This is done viciously.
[02:14:51.351 --> 02:14:52.792]  We can debate, but I know.
[02:14:52.792 --> 02:14:54.333]  I've studied the enemy.
[02:14:54.333 --> 02:14:55.674]  They want to create panic.
[02:14:55.674 --> 02:15:01.318]  They want to create fear, so that when they trigger things, people will panic, so they have an excuse to bring in even more control.
[02:15:01.318 --> 02:15:02.979]  That's what they show after the nuke goes off.
[02:15:03.499 --> 02:15:08.200]  Everybody lines the pumps, society breaks down, martial law at the end saves us though.
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:17.263]  We go to FEMA camps, North American Union saves us, British Union saves us with the EU, world government saves us, and what did the Wall Street Journal say last week?
[02:15:17.263 --> 02:15:21.625]  They said the new world order will save you!
[02:15:21.625 --> 02:15:24.705]  And they said that that's the only thing that will.
[02:15:24.705 --> 02:15:30.527]  So they have to introduce this everywhere, so they're doing it, but just go ahead.
[02:15:30.527 --> 02:15:33.008]  Well yeah, I mean, that's why I believe it to be a
[02:15:33.550 --> 02:15:34.530]  Propaganda piece.
[02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:45.453]  It's made to look, or it was in the beginning, it was made to look crude on purpose in order to discredit, you know, every issue that was brought up within it.
[02:15:45.453 --> 02:15:51.654]  You know, be that North American Union, be it internment camps, false flag terror.
[02:15:51.654 --> 02:16:02.937]  By putting it into the pages of a comic strip or crude photoshopped images, it kind of demeans the subjects, which are, you know, which do need to be
[02:16:03.556 --> 02:16:07.177]  Rationally debated, and they are real agendas.
[02:16:07.177 --> 02:16:11.598]  And which the establishment itself is fear-mongering about.
[02:16:11.598 --> 02:16:12.238]  Well, exactly.
[02:16:12.238 --> 02:16:15.779]  And if you ask yourself, why is this in the Telegraph?
[02:16:15.779 --> 02:16:23.541]  I mean, the majority of Telegraph readers are conservative English people in their 50s or their 60s.
[02:16:23.541 --> 02:16:28.582]  So what are they going to take from a series of crude Photoshop images
[02:16:28.971 --> 02:16:33.814]  Yeah, this is not some cyberpunk comic book shop publication.
[02:16:33.814 --> 02:16:34.294]  Well, exactly.
[02:16:34.294 --> 02:16:36.275]  They're not going to think, oh, this is a warning.
[02:16:36.275 --> 02:16:37.275]  I need to look into this.
[02:16:37.275 --> 02:16:45.460]  They're just going to dismiss every issue in there as, you know, pulp fiction.
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:55.625]  But, you know, it's been touted as fiction, you know, but we know that there's agendas to implement domestic police state control.
[02:16:56.618 --> 02:16:56.938]  I don't
[02:17:11.644 --> 02:17:12.685]  That you're absolutely right.
[02:17:12.685 --> 02:17:23.358]  This is meant, while they're simultaneously in the Financial Times saying, world government's good, we kept it secret from you for your own good, we're taking over, it's dictatorial, you'll have no rights, but we know what's best.
[02:17:23.358 --> 02:17:27.343]  While all these hundreds of publications are announcing world government, that's the answer to the crisis.
[02:17:28.502 --> 02:17:39.886]  They then are muddying the waters with it in entertainment, and right there in the news pages, to where when you mention it to people, they'll say, oh, you got that out of the comics.
[02:17:39.886 --> 02:17:44.128]  So again, this is psych warfare, very, very clearly.
[02:17:44.128 --> 02:17:48.630]  But yeah, let's look at who owns the London Telegraph.
[02:17:48.630 --> 02:17:53.912]  Okay, well, when was the London Telegraph established?
[02:17:53.912 --> 02:17:54.712]  It was established in
[02:17:56.152 --> 02:17:59.834]  In the, uh, mid-1800s by British nobility.
[02:17:59.834 --> 02:18:21.082]  It's been owned by... All along the line it's been owned by Barons, Viscounts, all the way up to Conrad Black, uh, who recently was involved in scandal and then had to sell the telegraph to the Barclay brothers, uh, Frederick and David Barclay, who now own and run the telegraph.
[02:18:21.082 --> 02:18:24.664]  Both regular attendees at Bilderberg meetings, um,
[02:18:25.256 --> 02:18:28.083]  Basically, they're not going to print anything.
[02:18:28.083 --> 02:18:32.494]  It's not some rag that's going to print a few poorly thrown together.
[02:18:33.846 --> 02:18:34.867]  Images.
[02:18:34.867 --> 02:18:40.129]  So... And right now we're showing images of the US and England.
[02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:42.331]  They put millions in concentration camps.
[02:18:42.331 --> 02:18:43.491]  It's the right thing to do.
[02:18:43.491 --> 02:18:46.073]  So they're showing everybody what's supposed to happen.
[02:18:46.073 --> 02:18:49.935]  Riot police crush anyone protesting is aiding terrorists.
[02:18:49.935 --> 02:18:52.916]  They claim that Syria and Iran detonated the nukes.
[02:18:52.916 --> 02:18:56.518]  So the United States and England nuke those nations.
[02:18:56.518 --> 02:18:59.180]  And then at the end of the comic book, the North American Union saves us.
[02:19:02.429 --> 02:19:06.351]  To stay at home, await further instructions, emergency transmission.
[02:19:06.351 --> 02:19:11.653]  So they're just preparing the subconscious for when this really happens so that we'll go along with it.
[02:19:11.653 --> 02:19:15.034]  They are map making in the mind.
[02:19:15.034 --> 02:19:16.295]  Steve?
[02:19:16.295 --> 02:19:18.896]  Yeah, I mean, preparing the subconscious is.
[02:19:18.896 --> 02:19:24.118]  That's classic, you know, description of what propaganda is.
[02:19:24.118 --> 02:19:28.620]  If you read Propaganda by Edward Bernays,
[02:19:29.957 --> 02:19:30.458]  I don't know.
[02:19:36.536 --> 02:19:37.757]  He goes over in detail.
[02:19:37.757 --> 02:19:39.358]  I can read you some quotes if you'd like.
[02:19:39.358 --> 02:19:40.019]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:19:40.019 --> 02:19:40.960]  Let's go over when we get back.
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:46.564]  Folks should go to Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com and read all three of the series.
[02:19:46.564 --> 02:19:53.169]  You can find the latest one posted today and then backtrack with links to the original part one he did on their part one.
[02:19:53.169 --> 02:19:54.470]  And look at it for yourself.
[02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:57.613]  And of course in the real world they're now implementing all of this.
[02:19:57.613 --> 02:19:59.234]  The FEMA camps, everything.
[02:19:59.234 --> 02:20:00.976]  They can't wait to get their hands on your children.
[02:20:01.704 --> 02:20:05.668]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[02:20:05.668 --> 02:20:11.134]  At EnduringRose.com, we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[02:20:11.134 --> 02:20:15.960]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:17.221]  Enduring Rose can help.
[02:20:17.611 --> 02:20:24.200]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:29.167]  These roses, forever preserved in either white or yellow gold, will never wither and never die.
[02:20:29.167 --> 02:20:32.812]  Unlike traditional roses, they will endure as a timeless symbol of your love.
[02:20:33.677 --> 02:20:34.057]  We're good to go.
[02:21:01.061 --> 02:21:07.743]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:07.743 --> 02:21:15.846]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:15.846 --> 02:21:24.009]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:24.009 --> 02:21:28.771]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:29.113 --> 02:21:34.337]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:34.337 --> 02:21:38.680]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:39.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:44.263]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:44.263 --> 02:21:49.167]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:52.169]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:52.169 --> 02:21:53.810]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.997 --> 02:21:57.257]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:11.371]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:11.371 --> 02:22:12.192]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:12.192 --> 02:22:13.152]  This is his M.O.
[02:22:13.152 --> 02:22:14.554]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:14.554 --> 02:22:16.555]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:16.555 --> 02:22:23.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:24.181]  Some U.S.
[02:22:24.181 --> 02:22:29.845]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:30.525 --> 02:22:34.047]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:34.047 --> 02:22:36.829]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:04.111]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[02:23:04.111 --> 02:23:09.853]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[02:23:09.853 --> 02:23:14.174]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[02:23:14.174 --> 02:23:16.635]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[02:23:16.635 --> 02:23:22.557]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[02:23:22.717 --> 02:23:23.457]  We're good to go!
[02:23:51.886 --> 02:23:54.748]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[02:23:54.748 --> 02:23:55.448]  That's 800-387-5516.
[02:23:55.448 --> 02:23:59.810]  Free shipping included.
[02:23:59.810 --> 02:24:10.536]  Alright, in the interest of time, let's go right back to Steve Watson and cut the great music.
[02:24:10.536 --> 02:24:12.778]  I don't think I played it on purpose.
[02:24:18.658 --> 02:24:21.120]  Alright, Steve, you've got the floor.
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:23.202]  I can sit here and interrupt all day and make my points.
[02:24:23.202 --> 02:24:29.327]  Go through the propaganda, go through what this series covers, then get into the Bernays' quotes.
[02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:32.189]  We're going to put the... I'm going to give you the floor during this segment.
[02:24:32.189 --> 02:24:34.371]  Just roll with it.
[02:24:34.371 --> 02:24:43.858]  Okay, well let's just go back and go to the start and go through what is actually in Operation Blackjack.
[02:24:43.858 --> 02:24:48.202]  So essentially, it began with Part 1 last month in January.
[02:24:48.986 --> 02:24:56.529]  Um, it was running in the Arts and Culture section of the London Telegraph, one of the biggest newspapers in the world.
[02:24:56.529 --> 02:25:12.234]  Uh, the first sort of installment showed pictures of MI5 logos with the date June the 20th and the caption saying, uh, MI5 report warns government of imminent terrorist attack.
[02:25:12.234 --> 02:25:17.056]  Uh, so then the date jumps forward to June the 21st, shows a caption of what is
[02:25:17.383 --> 02:25:27.607]  Apparently a large nuclear device, sorry, a small nuclear device loaded into a white van in the centre of London.
[02:25:27.607 --> 02:25:41.794]  Then it shows people panicking, buying groceries, fleeing the city, and then it jumps to June the 22nd and there's an image of a nuclear explosion over the city.
[02:25:41.794 --> 02:25:46.856]  It then shows various photoshopped crude images of ruins of famous
[02:25:48.266 --> 02:25:51.827]  London landmarks such as, you know, Big Ben, etc.
[02:25:51.827 --> 02:25:53.067]  Houses of Parliament.
[02:25:53.067 --> 02:25:55.368]  And then that's where Part 1 ended.
[02:25:55.368 --> 02:26:03.969]  So, you know, wasn't a lot in there to go on to begin with, so very strange that's when we started questioning why it was in there.
[02:26:03.969 --> 02:26:08.731]  Part 2 comes along about a week later.
[02:26:08.731 --> 02:26:15.052]  It continues the theme, but with images of nukes going off in New York, Washington DC, LA,
[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:27.894]  Portland, Mexico City, Toronto, and then another series of sort of crumbling remains of these major cities.
[02:26:27.894 --> 02:26:31.435]  Um, so, I mean, there wasn't really even a plot or a storyline.
[02:26:31.435 --> 02:26:42.718]  It was just, at this point, it was just a series of pictures put together on Photoshop, supposed to... supposed to, you know, depict this situation, but...
[02:26:44.215 --> 02:27:13.924]  The final image of Part 2 is an important one, because it showed a sort of mock screenshot, I think you've already had it up on the, on this screen there, for the viewers, of an emergency transmission from the Department of Homeland Security, which reads, stay at home and await further instructions, and then it has a sort of, an eagle, and if you've seen pictures of Nazi propaganda and things, and flags, etc, symbolism, it's exactly the same as that, and it's perched on top of a globe.
[02:27:14.557 --> 02:27:18.119]  And underneath are the words, Union of North America.
[02:27:18.119 --> 02:27:27.165]  And then below that, the words, Novus Ordo Seclorum, which translates as New Order of the Ages, or traditionally New World Order.
[02:27:27.165 --> 02:27:37.972]  And then there's also images of British policemen with this kind of, these kind of images on their uniforms and helmets, etc.
[02:27:37.972 --> 02:27:43.676]  And then, part three, kind of, it changed into a comic book style, um,
[02:27:44.178 --> 02:27:56.348]  So at this point you've got a series of nuclear attacks have gone off to usher in a sort of fascist world government headed by a union of America, UK, Canada and Mexico.
[02:27:56.348 --> 02:28:09.959]  And then it sort of switches to this comic strip which shows a group of men, supposedly officials of this new union, seemingly pleased with
[02:28:12.461 --> 02:28:15.502]  God bless you and God bless the Union of North America.
[02:28:15.502 --> 02:28:24.526]  Seemingly pleased with the reports that they're pouring over of casualties and destruction.
[02:28:24.526 --> 02:28:27.748]  And they say, oh, this has exceeded our wildest expectations.
[02:28:27.748 --> 02:28:29.889]  We need to move on to phase two.
[02:28:29.889 --> 02:28:41.674]  So at that point, you're clearly supposed to deduce that these people who are representing a new form of government are somehow involved in the operation related to the attacks.
[02:28:42.717 --> 02:29:08.586]  And then, as we've gone over, the further images show military attacks on Iran, Syria, China, domestic police, state, martial law, concentration camps set up to hold collaborators and dissenters, images of the Amero coin indicating that a new global currency is being created.
[02:29:08.586 --> 02:29:11.387]  And that's where Part 3 ends.
[02:29:12.304 --> 02:29:16.725]  So, who knows if there's going to be a part four.
[02:29:16.725 --> 02:29:22.966]  But if there is a part four, I assume that, you know, this is all going to be there to save everyone.
[02:29:22.966 --> 02:29:28.708]  Well, Steve, I did see some tiles in there where it's like, oh, the panic's over, you know, the economy's back.
[02:29:28.708 --> 02:29:31.968]  I did see one along those lines at the end.
[02:29:31.968 --> 02:29:37.990]  But there's more than just them conditioning our subconscious here.
[02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:39.830]  Psychopaths like to leave tokens.
[02:29:41.755 --> 02:29:45.598]  At their crime scenes, they like to call and taunt the police.
[02:29:45.598 --> 02:29:46.939]  They like to brag.
[02:29:46.939 --> 02:29:51.643]  So, coming from this paper, it's just very chilling.
[02:29:51.643 --> 02:29:53.044]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.044 --> 02:29:55.566]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.566 --> 02:30:03.313]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.313 --> 02:30:05.014]  With rising unemployment and an
[02:30:10.404 --> 02:30:11.365]  I don't know.
[02:30:30.213 --> 02:30:34.336]  The Stinger keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[02:30:34.336 --> 02:30:43.001]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[02:31:01.235 --> 02:31:03.396]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:31:03.396 --> 02:31:05.818]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:31:05.818 --> 02:31:08.059]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:31:08.059 --> 02:31:09.640]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:11.321]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:11.321 --> 02:31:14.223]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:31:14.223 --> 02:31:17.865]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:31:27.513 --> 02:31:32.376]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:31:32.376 --> 02:31:33.477]  An inside job.
[02:31:36.181 --> 02:31:38.824]  How dare you?
[02:31:38.824 --> 02:31:43.708]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:31:43.708 --> 02:31:46.411]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:31:46.411 --> 02:31:52.837]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:31:58.163 --> 02:32:00.645]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:32:01.221 --> 02:32:02.922]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:32:02.922 --> 02:32:04.663]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:32:04.663 --> 02:32:07.344]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:32:07.344 --> 02:32:12.486]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:32:12.486 --> 02:32:15.667]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:32:15.667 --> 02:32:19.169]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[02:32:46.631 --> 02:32:51.953]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually
[02:33:14.068 --> 02:33:16.149]  To love their servitude.
[02:33:16.149 --> 02:33:25.871]  A people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:33:25.871 --> 02:33:31.432]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:31.432 --> 02:33:36.994]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:36.994 --> 02:33:38.774]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:45.337]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:33:45.337 --> 02:33:47.681]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:33:47.681 --> 02:33:50.147]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:33:52.304 --> 02:33:58.645]  Mercury-containing vacuums may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:33:58.645 --> 02:34:05.547]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:34:05.547 --> 02:34:10.548]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:34:10.548 --> 02:34:13.488]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:34:13.488 --> 02:34:17.769]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[02:34:17.769 --> 02:34:20.730]  We have to work the dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:34:22.054 --> 02:34:26.140]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:27.381]  Well, join me.
[02:34:27.381 --> 02:34:29.764]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:34:29.764 --> 02:34:33.149]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:34:33.149 --> 02:34:39.638]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:34:48.646 --> 02:34:49.626]  You know what's amazing?
[02:34:49.626 --> 02:34:55.729]  I look at all these unhappy people who even have jobs, but a lot of folks don't.
[02:34:55.729 --> 02:34:57.029]  And they think life's boring.
[02:34:57.029 --> 02:35:09.854]  We're spinning through the black void of space surrounded by trillions of galaxies, quadrillions of planets, nebulas, black holes.
[02:35:09.854 --> 02:35:15.797]  We're on an incredible sphere with a ribbon of atmosphere and
[02:35:17.048 --> 02:35:21.452]  Huge oceans with all these amazing life forms.
[02:35:21.452 --> 02:35:26.537]  We are these creatures who don't even know our own history.
[02:35:26.537 --> 02:35:29.800]  Who are just now developing technology.
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:32.863]  Who knows what we could do in the stars.
[02:35:32.863 --> 02:35:37.367]  And instead we have a bunch of criminals running our system.
[02:35:37.367 --> 02:35:40.610]  And the public is unable to truly dream outside their controlled paradigm.
[02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:51.292]  And so, are just basically following the manipulations and programming that the establishment uses, punching their primitive buttons.
[02:35:51.292 --> 02:35:58.534]  Now, let us go ahead and go back to Steve Watson.
[02:35:58.534 --> 02:36:09.757]  Steve, I want to cover a few other issues with you, but anything else you want to add about this particular story of this Blackjack series in the London Telegraph?
[02:36:11.986 --> 02:36:21.548]  I suppose the other thing to mention is that a lot of readers asking for clarification contacted the Telegraph.
[02:36:21.548 --> 02:36:25.669]  And the overwhelming response from the newspaper itself was a hostile one.
[02:36:25.669 --> 02:36:28.829]  They were belligerent to callers.
[02:36:28.829 --> 02:36:33.190]  Apparently no one wants to talk about it at the Telegraph.
[02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:40.412]  Readers have been interrogated as to why they care what the piece is supposed to be.
[02:36:40.412 --> 02:36:41.592]  People have hung up on them.
[02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:52.192]  Basically, the paper won't advise, you know... Oh yeah, asking questions or even being able to read now is seen as like out being Al-Qaeda.
[02:36:52.192 --> 02:36:53.232]  I mean, literally.
[02:36:53.232 --> 02:36:58.833]  It's like, you're asking questions, you're taking photos of the police, you're a terrorist.
[02:36:58.833 --> 02:37:02.113]  They're trying that in England now too, aren't they?
[02:37:02.113 --> 02:37:02.954]  Well, exactly.
[02:37:02.954 --> 02:37:10.915]  I mean, the paper just got angry, basically, and wouldn't give an explanation at all as to the content that they're supplying their readers.
[02:37:12.412 --> 02:37:15.653]  So I suppose that's where we are with it, really.
[02:37:15.653 --> 02:37:31.720]  I'm sure there'll be more developments, but some people on other forums claim to have identified who the author is, but I haven't checked that, and I don't think there's any direct evidence of that at the moment.
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:32.961]  So we're still... That's another thing.
[02:37:32.961 --> 02:37:37.403]  Normally in an art section, they would tell you who the artist was, but the way this is... Well, exactly.
[02:37:37.403 --> 02:37:39.424]  That's the point of an art section, isn't it?
[02:37:40.445 --> 02:37:53.511]  Artists to gain recognition and that's what the readers were Concerned about but you know they wouldn't even tell the readers who the artist was so what is the point of the piece?
[02:37:53.511 --> 02:38:08.818]  That shows everybody going into FEMA camps and nukes going off and the government staging the attacks and setting up a North American Union and Merging it with England which which they say the England's actually merged with the North American Union as the Anglo-American establishment airstrip one
[02:38:13.103 --> 02:38:14.283]  Boy, they are nasty.
[02:38:14.283 --> 02:38:22.345]  Normally when they do stuff like this, and we're seeing a lot of this pop up on TV and shows like Jericho and others, it means they're planning it.
[02:38:22.345 --> 02:38:27.386]  When they knew coming to have to watch the public run around and worship the government, it just never ends.
[02:38:27.386 --> 02:38:30.207]  I just want to lose everything, I guess.
[02:38:30.207 --> 02:38:30.887]  Go ahead.
[02:38:30.887 --> 02:38:39.968]  I mean, going back to the propaganda thing, you can see it as an effort to frame the subconscious, because that's what propaganda essentially is.
[02:38:39.968 --> 02:38:41.149]  That's what Bernays wrote.
[02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:58.896]  It's a mass manipulation, a framing of the world that you live in and then, you know, creating the appearance that you're, you have free will within that, but you're always trapped within the framed world around you.
[02:38:58.896 --> 02:39:12.701]  It's like, I suppose the best example is the prisoner with Patrick McGowan who escapes the village, but he's still, you know, he's still within the village because the village has been crafted over
[02:39:13.371 --> 02:39:15.972]  Over centuries, all around us.
[02:39:15.972 --> 02:39:18.773]  And that's essentially what propaganda is.
[02:39:18.773 --> 02:39:22.914]  Bernays wrote Organizing Chaos.
[02:39:22.914 --> 02:39:25.895]  And, you know... Well, that's if they understand... Go ahead.
[02:39:25.895 --> 02:39:29.877]  This Black Jack seems... It doesn't seem to be a social commentary.
[02:39:29.877 --> 02:39:32.218]  It's just a cold piece.
[02:39:32.218 --> 02:39:42.121]  And in that sense, it's got the hallmarks of propaganda, of social manipulation, bringing a sort of standard to bear for the masses.
[02:39:44.864 --> 02:39:49.945]  Yeah, it's a flaunting in our face what they may do to us.
[02:39:49.945 --> 02:39:54.086]  But this action itself is a form of terrorism, the threat of violence.
[02:39:54.086 --> 02:39:57.727]  Well, they know, they've seen the statistics, the polls, the numbers in England, the U.S.
[02:39:57.727 --> 02:40:03.448]  and Europe, where the majority of people believe that the 9-11 was an inside job or that there's a cover-up.
[02:40:03.448 --> 02:40:05.469]  And I think this is a message to us.
[02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:09.810]  The New World Order crowd loves multi-dimensional images.
[02:40:09.810 --> 02:40:13.331]  They love something that has different effects on different classes.
[02:40:13.911 --> 02:40:17.593]  And they see themselves as real artists at this art form.
[02:40:17.593 --> 02:40:19.694]  And so, it's also a threat to everyone.
[02:40:19.694 --> 02:40:20.895]  It's an inside joke to them.
[02:40:20.895 --> 02:40:23.916]  It further conditions and creates anxiety in the public.
[02:40:23.916 --> 02:40:30.100]  Then when we talk about real government-sponsored terror, they'll say, oh, you saw that in a cartoon.
[02:40:30.100 --> 02:40:33.942]  Yeah, it's always gonna, it's always gonna evolve the propaganda as well.
[02:40:33.942 --> 02:40:38.144]  But I'll read you a quote from Bernays, his sort of end quote in propaganda.
[02:40:38.144 --> 02:40:41.806]  He says, if the public becomes more intelligent in its commercial demands,
[02:40:42.318 --> 02:40:50.064]  Commercial firms will meet the new standards if it becomes aware of the old methods used to persuade it to accept a given idea or commodity.
[02:40:50.064 --> 02:40:53.227]  Its leaders will present their appeals more intelligently.
[02:40:53.227 --> 02:40:54.708]  Propaganda will never die out.
[02:40:54.708 --> 02:41:03.034]  Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring order out of chaos.
[02:41:03.034 --> 02:41:11.221]  So it's always going to be evolving and changing and multi-dimensional levels of it, but in the end it's all about framing the society we live in.
[02:41:11.221 --> 02:41:11.501]  We know
[02:41:12.774 --> 02:41:18.556]  That's, you know, that's what their agenda is, that's what they're about.
[02:41:18.556 --> 02:41:19.857]  These are some sick people.
[02:41:19.857 --> 02:41:27.880]  I mean, these are some really, really sick people.
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:40.284]  I mean, but, you know, other people, other readers are saying it may be somebody who's sending a warning, and that's perfectly fine for them to, it's a valid point for them to bring that up, but it's not
[02:41:40.734 --> 02:41:43.938]  Though we can give our opinions, it's not to us to tell them what to think.
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:59.381]  In fact, I'm really 100 percent, but I'll just say 90.
[02:41:59.381 --> 02:42:02.941]  And because they didn't put who the artist is, there's a lot of issues here.
[02:42:02.941 --> 02:42:10.022]  See, when you see an article in a newspaper and it doesn't have a name, that automatically means from the editorial board of the paper.
[02:42:10.022 --> 02:42:12.243]  And you'll see articles that don't even say from the editorial board.
[02:42:12.243 --> 02:42:14.003]  It'll just be there.
[02:42:14.003 --> 02:42:15.843]  And this is from the editorial board.
[02:42:15.843 --> 02:42:18.944]  That's the language of a newspaper.
[02:42:18.944 --> 02:42:24.165]  That if it doesn't say who it's from, it's just an article, that is the sense of the paper.
[02:42:25.848 --> 02:42:29.191]  And so in the language of this, that's what we're dealing with.
[02:42:29.191 --> 02:42:30.893]  And people can say, well, why are you focusing in on this?
[02:42:30.893 --> 02:42:38.862]  Because so many times, what they put out is what they end up doing.
[02:42:39.775 --> 02:42:48.879]  And people say, oh, the lone government episode of the government flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center to get martial law and, you know, attack Afghanistan and using a drill to make them stand down.
[02:42:48.879 --> 02:42:50.400]  That's just a coincidence.
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:59.264]  We happen to have folks from the X-Files, Dean Hagelin, one came to my house, you know, opened the door and it's the TV guy, to say, no, the CIA planted this stuff on us.
[02:43:02.401 --> 02:43:04.062]  This tells us a lot about the globalists.
[02:43:04.062 --> 02:43:06.704]  They're very intelligent, but they're also psychopathic.
[02:43:06.704 --> 02:43:09.727]  They're very intelligent psychopaths, sadistic psychopaths.
[02:43:10.905 --> 02:43:12.465]  And they're very bored.
[02:43:12.465 --> 02:43:18.687]  This is, you know, what all these aristocrats having too much time on their hands turns into.
[02:43:18.687 --> 02:43:22.688]  And this is what they giggle and snicker about in their little secret meetings.
[02:43:22.688 --> 02:43:25.389]  And they think the revelation of the method is funny.
[02:43:25.389 --> 02:43:32.931]  And they also say they're God, they're the new man, because they can scientifically coldly understand their own human intellect.
[02:43:33.391 --> 02:43:45.674]  And then so they can kill a baby and not feel any emotions, or they can blow up a country and not feel emotions, or they can kill 3,000 people in two towers and not feel anything, and it's only us that are primitive and weak that let our emotions control us.
[02:43:45.674 --> 02:43:46.014]  No!
[02:43:46.014 --> 02:43:48.574]  I am a human being.
[02:43:48.574 --> 02:43:50.135]  I was developed on this planet.
[02:43:50.135 --> 02:43:52.055]  I have children.
[02:43:52.055 --> 02:43:53.755]  I am a reproductive creature.
[02:43:53.755 --> 02:43:54.976]  I am meant to be nurturative.
[02:43:54.976 --> 02:43:56.136]  I am meant to defend my family.
[02:43:56.136 --> 02:43:57.256]  I am meant to build.
[02:43:57.256 --> 02:43:58.676]  This is who I am.
[02:43:58.676 --> 02:43:59.657]  This is the species.
[02:43:59.657 --> 02:44:00.697]  This is what we are.
[02:44:01.714 --> 02:44:08.669]  And watching what the globalists do, it's a horrible, aberrant form of humanity.
[02:44:13.012 --> 02:44:17.855]  You know, their whole social Darwinistic view, everything they do, it's really just selfishness.
[02:44:17.855 --> 02:44:20.337]  And the proof is, they're holding humanity back.
[02:44:20.337 --> 02:44:26.181]  If they were so slick and so powerful, they wouldn't be trying to poison people and dumb them down so we'd be more manageable.
[02:44:26.181 --> 02:44:37.729]  If they're such God-men, they would be trying to empower everyone and trying to build us to the highest level because they're so much higher than us.
[02:44:37.729 --> 02:44:38.790]  But they've got this sick
[02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:40.981]  Well, exactly, yeah.
[02:44:40.981 --> 02:44:45.203]  If you want to put it a different way, it's a total lack of any sort of spirituality or belief in the rest of the human race, really.
[02:44:45.203 --> 02:44:47.544]  They want it all, and they want to control it all.
[02:45:12.005 --> 02:45:13.066]  Well, they don't just want it all.
[02:45:13.066 --> 02:45:14.787]  They want to desecrate it all.
[02:45:14.787 --> 02:45:15.848]  They want to mutilate it all.
[02:45:15.848 --> 02:45:17.769]  They want to vandalize it all.
[02:45:17.769 --> 02:45:23.373]  They want to kill everything beautiful, pull down everything decent.
[02:45:23.373 --> 02:45:27.536]  They boil with hatred at youth and life and goodness.
[02:45:27.536 --> 02:45:37.143]  Because by its very nature, it's a bunch of old, demonic creatures who are totally given over to evil by the choices they've made in life that are in control of it.
[02:45:42.808 --> 02:45:45.431]  I agree.
[02:45:45.431 --> 02:45:46.993]  Yeah.
[02:45:46.993 --> 02:45:48.836]  I can't tell you, I completely bet myself.
[02:45:57.673 --> 02:46:03.098]  Iceland's, the government's fallen, but British banks own Iceland, so people can't even get their money out of the banks.
[02:46:03.098 --> 02:46:05.240]  Europe's in 20% unemployment.
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:11.686]  We're reading about riots all over Europe, but we're being told that the level of the riots is being suppressed.
[02:46:11.686 --> 02:46:15.209]  Your take on Madoff, all of this.
[02:46:15.209 --> 02:46:18.472]  Well, the economy is the same as over there.
[02:46:18.472 --> 02:46:19.292]  It's on its knees.
[02:46:19.292 --> 02:46:24.337]  I mean, basically because we've got the same policies over here, you know.
[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:37.126]  Bailouts, we had a recent bailout to the tune of, erm, oh it was a guarantee, the government guaranteeing bank loans to the tune of 200 billion.
[02:46:37.126 --> 02:46:49.033]  Erm, all this printing excessive money, they've just, the Bank of England's just dropped rates to the lowest, you know, they've ever been since the, since the initiation of the Bank of England.
[02:46:49.033 --> 02:46:52.775]  So, keeping it all artificially, it's all the same policies that
[02:46:53.427 --> 02:47:06.096]  You know, your government's got over there, and that's because, by proxy, the... both governments are run out of... by the international bankers and corporations out of London.
[02:47:06.096 --> 02:47:21.507]  So, yeah, it's exactly the same over here as it is over there, and... while there are some, you know, protests and riots and things over here, they're not getting any sort of mainstream coverage, and they're nowhere near
[02:47:22.077 --> 02:47:27.141]  On as big a scale as they are in Europe at the moment.
[02:47:27.141 --> 02:47:33.187]  But, you know, it remains to be seen whether that will change.
[02:47:33.187 --> 02:47:46.198]  In other news, watching Obama not just go back on every promise, but arrogantly say, we're getting all the CEO pay capped, which then they can selectively put caps on other people, and then all the big CEOs in banking
[02:47:48.083 --> 02:47:48.403]  No, they're not.
[02:47:48.403 --> 02:47:50.564]  To be honest, at the moment, they're still, you know, they're sort of
[02:48:18.226 --> 02:48:33.091]  The summation of what we're getting in our media is still the sort of messianic image of the great new leader, Obama.
[02:48:33.091 --> 02:48:41.194]  There's very little focus on the nightly news, on the actual nuts and bolts of the
[02:48:42.037 --> 02:48:44.438]  Executive orders that he's been issuing.
[02:48:44.438 --> 02:48:50.239]  So it's just all part of ongoing hype to make everybody feel good while the looting is completed.
[02:48:50.239 --> 02:48:56.061]  Yeah, it's still going on and I think it'll go on for the foreseeable future.
[02:48:56.061 --> 02:49:03.042]  I mean, you know, there's no, there's no investigation of what he's doing already.
[02:49:03.042 --> 02:49:08.944]  Um, it's going to take something significant, I think, for that to, for that to change over here.
[02:49:11.186 --> 02:49:16.768]  Well, I love how the mainstream media keeps saying, Obama, you know, he wasn't part of the bailout, that was Bush.
[02:49:16.768 --> 02:49:36.754]  Obama went and cheerleaded for it, they're all together in on it, and Obama's camp followers... I'm just so tired of watching the left-right bait-and-switch over and over again, and that's why we're enslaved, because the public loves to feel like they're important, loves to feel like they've had a hollow victory, instead of a real victory.
[02:49:39.465 --> 02:49:51.949]  Yeah, I mean, the big one was his executive order which protected continuation of CIA renditions.
[02:49:51.949 --> 02:50:06.114]  An article I wrote about that a few days ago, good quote in there, was from a British Labour member of the European Parliament, and the European Parliament was responsible for investigating the renditions, and he said,
[02:50:07.537 --> 02:50:14.042]  You know, he directly said you can't criticise Obama because at the moment he's got a god-like status.
[02:50:14.042 --> 02:50:33.458]  Um, you know, he said on the surface it looks like he's closing all his secret prisons and everything but, you know, people have got to look further into what he's actually, his actual executive orders say and it says directly in there that he's leaving open the door for, uh,
[02:50:34.488 --> 02:50:42.890]  Both rendition and the continuation of the secret facilities, military facilities, which we know they use for torture.
[02:50:42.890 --> 02:50:49.152]  Steve Watson, I want to appreciate you and the great job you're doing at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net.
[02:50:49.152 --> 02:50:50.993]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[02:50:50.993 --> 02:50:53.053]  Keep up the great work.
[02:50:53.053 --> 02:50:53.733]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:50:53.733 --> 02:50:54.394]  Cheers.
[02:50:54.394 --> 02:50:55.014]  You bet.
[02:50:55.014 --> 02:50:57.655]  We'll be back with a ton of news, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[02:50:57.655 --> 02:50:58.875]  We've got an hour and ten minutes left.
[02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:05.913]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:51:05.913 --> 02:51:10.178]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:51:10.178 --> 02:51:18.148]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[02:51:18.408 --> 02:51:18.848]  We're good to go!
[02:51:48.428 --> 02:51:50.590]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:11.707 --> 02:52:13.269]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:14.069]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:14.069 --> 02:52:15.050]  This is his MO.
[02:52:15.050 --> 02:52:16.432]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:16.432 --> 02:52:18.434]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:18.434 --> 02:52:25.581]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:25.581 --> 02:52:26.062]  Some U.S.
[02:52:26.062 --> 02:52:31.708]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:32.388 --> 02:52:35.910]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:38.691]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:53:02.170 --> 02:53:02.751]  We're good to go.
[02:53:22.671 --> 02:53:23.272]  Thanks for watching!
[02:53:39.551 --> 02:53:40.592]  Do your part.
[02:53:40.592 --> 02:53:43.213]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[02:53:43.213 --> 02:53:52.417]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[02:53:52.417 --> 02:53:58.900]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[02:53:58.900 --> 02:54:00.281]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:54:19.816 --> 02:54:23.159]  Okay, we are back live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:23.159 --> 02:54:27.883]  I'm going to go through the big stack of news and take your phone calls the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:27.883 --> 02:54:29.964]  And we'll also play some video clips that I've got coming up.
[02:54:38.874 --> 02:54:41.836]  We got a videotape order in the mail from Germany.
[02:54:41.836 --> 02:54:45.159]  I'm not going to say the guy's name.
[02:54:45.159 --> 02:54:48.262]  This is his first name's Rainer.
[02:54:48.262 --> 02:54:52.425]  And he sent me a 1923 Weimar Republic Deutschmark.
[02:54:52.425 --> 02:54:58.990]  These are the ones they had wheelbarrows to buy a loaf of bread with.
[02:54:58.990 --> 02:55:06.476]  So we'll cut over there to this camera and I'll give folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv a close-up shot of that.
[02:55:06.476 --> 02:55:06.876]  It says
[02:55:09.847 --> 02:55:23.814]  It says that this is a fiat mark, the 1923 mark note from the town of Ogersheim, where the former Chancellor Helmut Kohl was born.
[02:55:23.814 --> 02:55:26.556]  And we appreciate the present, we appreciate the gift.
[02:55:26.556 --> 02:55:31.618]  And this one is for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 100,000, 20 million Deutschmarks!
[02:55:37.606 --> 02:55:39.087]  That's 20 million, right?
[02:55:39.087 --> 02:55:49.234]  Yeah, 20 million Deutsche Marks, and you could maybe at one point buy maybe a slice of bread with this, maybe if you were lucky.
[02:55:49.234 --> 02:55:53.156]  So that's what could happen to your fiat currency, and that's what they're doing.
[02:55:53.156 --> 02:55:58.520]  As soon as the confidence is lost in the dollar, there's pretty much no way that this isn't going to happen.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:02.763]  Massive, massive inflation and devaluation of the currency.
[02:56:02.763 --> 02:56:04.104]  Boy, they got prettier money than we do.
[02:56:05.177 --> 02:56:18.044]  Even though this piece of paper, you couldn't, at one point in Germany, you couldn't buy the paper to print this on for 20 million Deutschmarks.
[02:56:18.044 --> 02:56:18.785]  To give you an idea.
[02:56:20.167 --> 02:56:20.888]  of it.
[02:56:20.888 --> 02:56:31.013]  Perhaps we should scan this in and put it up on the web for just the regular radio listeners who aren't watching right now live at PrisonPlanet.tv or when we archive the show.
[02:56:31.013 --> 02:56:32.514]  But I'm staying here going down with the ship.
[02:56:32.514 --> 02:56:38.838]  I'm not running off to our little farm out in the countryside, though I think about it every day.
[02:56:38.838 --> 02:56:40.799]  We're actually expanding in the midst of this storm.
[02:56:42.364 --> 02:56:53.757]  And doing our best, because people are tuning in more than ever, they know we're telling the truth more than ever, and folks definitely are concerned and want to get involved in the fight more.
[02:56:53.757 --> 02:56:58.242]  Speaking of sponsors, who makes this radio show possible?
[02:56:59.008 --> 02:57:02.111]  Well, it's people like eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:57:02.111 --> 02:57:08.477]  eFoodsDirect.com, that's the website for the longest continually operating storable foods company in the United States.
[02:57:08.477 --> 02:57:13.281]  It's where I get my storable foods, non-GMO, no MSG, no aspartame in it.
[02:57:13.281 --> 02:57:16.744]  eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[02:57:16.744 --> 02:57:20.788]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com and check out their new three-day, one adult food supply for only $21.95.
[02:57:20.788 --> 02:57:21.249]  It's a good sampler.
[02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:41.807]  To check out just a small selection of some of the great storable foods they have that last 10 years in un-climate controlled, more than 10 years in climate controlled conditions, efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633, or again, check them out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:57:41.807 --> 02:57:46.070]  Another sponsor along the same line of preparedness is mysolarbackup.com.
[02:57:47.336 --> 02:57:52.098]  It is designed to provide 800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[02:57:52.098 --> 02:57:59.201]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 1800 power plant, and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:57:59.201 --> 02:58:00.501]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[02:58:00.501 --> 02:58:04.303]  Remember too that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout gas pumps can...
[02:58:04.983 --> 02:58:07.725]  Pump gas because you can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:58:07.725 --> 02:58:10.988]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[02:58:10.988 --> 02:58:13.370]  It's perfect for emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:58:13.370 --> 02:58:14.831]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:58:14.831 --> 02:58:16.492]  That's www.MySolarBackup.com.
[02:58:16.492 --> 02:58:17.173]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:58:17.173 --> 02:58:17.253]  877-327-0365.
[02:58:17.253 --> 02:58:18.814]  The great folks from Solutions from Science.
[02:58:27.881 --> 02:58:39.152]  We're going to come back and take a few phone calls and continue with calls and I've got to go through my giant stack of news I've got disheveled here so that we can go through all the important headlines and information we haven't covered yet.
[02:58:39.152 --> 02:58:43.456]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.456 --> 02:58:45.959]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.959 --> 02:58:48.261]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:52.922]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.922 --> 02:58:57.689]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.689 --> 02:59:00.653]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.653 --> 02:59:03.697]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.697 --> 02:59:08.404]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.624 --> 02:59:09.766]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.766 --> 02:59:13.010]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.010 --> 02:59:20.000]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[02:59:54.051 --> 02:59:56.432]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.432 --> 02:59:59.213]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.023 --> 03:00:27.146]  All right, we are back live here, ladies and gentlemen, and I had a headphone malfunction.
[03:00:27.146 --> 03:00:28.187]  I couldn't fix it in one minute.
[03:00:28.187 --> 03:00:29.848]  The earpiece broke off.
[03:00:29.848 --> 03:00:30.729]  In fact, you know what?
[03:00:30.729 --> 03:00:31.449]  It'll take too long.
[03:00:31.449 --> 03:00:33.590]  I can just do it live on air, under the pressure.
[03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:39.154]  I had about 30 seconds to do it, and I was unable, and if you guys can't, I can just fix it right now on air.
[03:00:39.154 --> 03:00:40.715]  Or they've got more headsets down the hall.
[03:00:41.826 --> 03:00:42.926]  And I can do that.
[03:00:42.926 --> 03:00:46.948]  Doing a live radio show for four hours a day is a lot of fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:46.948 --> 03:00:50.649]  Sometimes interesting stuff happens and you're not able to go to the phone call.
[03:00:50.649 --> 03:00:54.330]  But we'll have a lot of phone calls coming up in this hour.
[03:00:54.330 --> 03:00:59.372]  And there's an important piece of news that I have not gotten to yet.
[03:01:01.445 --> 03:01:23.492]  Stabenow, Dems May Hold Talk Radio Accountability Hearings, and it's a clip with her on the radio host Bill Press, formerly of Crossfire, and in this piece, I'm going to play a clip of, she just says, yeah, we want to bring back something like the Fairness Doctrine, the Fairness Doctrine, another Orwellian term.
[03:01:23.492 --> 03:01:29.154]  You know, if they pull troops out of a place, they call it a build-down.
[03:01:30.703 --> 03:01:44.067]  If they're increasing troops, you know they have a different term for it, they call the Patriot Act patriotic.
[03:01:44.067 --> 03:01:55.310]  There's just all sorts of little word manipulations that they engage in, so we're going to be playing that coming up just a little bit later in this radio transmission.
[03:01:55.310 --> 03:01:57.610]  And I guess up next is Patrick in Canada.
[03:01:57.610 --> 03:01:59.191]  Thanks for holding Patrick, you're on the air.
[03:02:01.564 --> 03:02:02.184]  How you doing, brother?
[03:02:02.184 --> 03:02:02.864]  Good, sir.
[03:02:02.864 --> 03:02:03.944]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:03.944 --> 03:02:04.385]  Good.
[03:02:04.385 --> 03:02:08.145]  I just wanted to let you know of a story that I heard yesterday from one of my customers.
[03:02:08.145 --> 03:02:10.286]  Absolutely made my head shake.
[03:02:10.286 --> 03:02:19.488]  Him and his wife, they were leaving a couple weeks ago to go on a trip to the Caribbean, Flying Air Canada, which is basically the largest airline in Canada.
[03:02:19.488 --> 03:02:30.210]  And upon getting to the booth where they basically checked their tickets, the ticket agent told him that due to his name, he was on a terror list and unable to board the plane.
[03:02:31.007 --> 03:02:34.448]  He's got one of those weird names where the first and last name are the same, i.e.
[03:02:34.448 --> 03:02:37.089]  William William type of thing.
[03:02:37.089 --> 03:02:42.350]  And they said that that type of name is very common to use by terrorists.
[03:02:42.350 --> 03:02:48.472]  But what was even more puzzling was that the agent said to him, if you want to sign up for frequent flyer,
[03:02:49.218 --> 03:02:51.120]  We can remove your name from the list.
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:12.741]  It's about getting us all used to, oh, I've got to go away with you.
[03:03:12.741 --> 03:03:13.482]  I'm a terrorist.
[03:03:13.482 --> 03:03:14.602]  Oh, we've got to take you in.
[03:03:14.602 --> 03:03:15.563]  Your name's suspicious.
[03:03:15.563 --> 03:03:16.623]  You're on a list.
[03:03:16.623 --> 03:03:17.964]  It's not just going to be in the airports.
[03:03:17.964 --> 03:03:24.286]  The Pentagon admits it's going to be on the streets, where the troops or the paramilitary police pull you over, and they just grab whoever they want who's on the list.
[03:03:24.286 --> 03:03:25.287]  And it's, well, you're on the list.
[03:03:25.287 --> 03:03:26.407]  This shouldn't be a problem.
[03:03:26.407 --> 03:03:28.148]  And you're used to being on the list so many times.
[03:03:28.148 --> 03:03:30.789]  When they finally take you, you don't fight back.
[03:03:30.789 --> 03:03:33.310]  This is very sadistic, what they're doing.
[03:03:33.310 --> 03:03:34.951]  And I have heard reports they're doing it.
[03:03:34.951 --> 03:03:36.411]  Well, they call it trusted traveler.
[03:03:36.411 --> 03:03:38.092]  Well, just sign up with us.
[03:03:38.692 --> 03:03:40.774]  And agree to go through more screening and then you'll be alright.
[03:03:40.774 --> 03:03:41.335]  Is that what he said?
[03:03:41.335 --> 03:03:42.395]  Well, that's it.
[03:03:42.395 --> 03:03:45.879]  But it's like they're rewarding terrorists now.
[03:03:45.879 --> 03:03:46.980]  But it's not terrorism.
[03:03:46.980 --> 03:03:48.881]  It's a blacklist.
[03:03:48.881 --> 03:03:52.164]  If somebody was really a suspected terrorist, they should be arrested.
[03:03:52.164 --> 03:03:53.165]  It's total crap.
[03:03:53.165 --> 03:03:54.026]  They're the terrorists.
[03:03:54.026 --> 03:03:56.889]  They carried out the attack.
[03:03:56.889 --> 03:03:57.730]  What else did he say?
[03:03:57.730 --> 03:03:58.791]  What else did he say?
[03:03:58.791 --> 03:04:00.152]  Well, basically that was it.
[03:04:00.152 --> 03:04:03.435]  Him and his wife were harassed to the point where his wife was almost in tears.
[03:04:04.287 --> 03:04:11.312]  And they were in such disbelief that, you know, by subscribing to whatever options they were giving him, that they'd remove his name from the list.
[03:04:11.312 --> 03:04:17.737]  They basically had to cancel their tickets and go and sit and wait five or six hours for another airline to get their trip.
[03:04:17.737 --> 03:04:22.220]  So, just complete manhandling of an individual for no real reason.
[03:04:22.220 --> 03:04:23.401]  No, but that's what it's about!
[03:04:23.401 --> 03:04:27.364]  Going through the checkpoints, being searched, your children being searched at school.
[03:04:27.364 --> 03:04:31.947]  It's about training you to have learned helplessness.
[03:04:31.947 --> 03:04:32.948]  It's an absolute joke.
[03:04:34.474 --> 03:04:35.315]  It's real, man.
[03:04:35.315 --> 03:04:38.857]  These people are building death camps.
[03:04:38.857 --> 03:04:43.280]  How many people does Canadian airports beat to death?
[03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:44.881]  Anything else you want to add, sir?
[03:04:44.881 --> 03:04:45.501]  No, that's it.
[03:04:45.501 --> 03:04:46.401]  I love the show, bro.
[03:04:46.401 --> 03:04:47.322]  Keep it going.
[03:04:47.322 --> 03:04:47.902]  Thank you.
[03:04:47.902 --> 03:04:54.527]  Yeah, for folks that think we're making stuff up, stuff so crazy, I can't even explain how bad it is and how out of control.
[03:04:54.527 --> 03:04:54.967]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.573 --> 03:05:08.335]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:08.335 --> 03:05:10.975]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:10.975 --> 03:05:12.516]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:12.516 --> 03:05:13.316]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:13.316 --> 03:05:14.276]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:14.276 --> 03:05:15.636]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:15.636 --> 03:05:17.697]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:17.697 --> 03:05:24.838]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:24.838 --> 03:05:25.319]  Some U.S.
[03:05:25.319 --> 03:05:30.960]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:31.660 --> 03:05:35.161]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:05:35.161 --> 03:05:37.962]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:01.328 --> 03:06:07.175]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[03:06:07.175 --> 03:06:17.048]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[03:06:17.168 --> 03:06:21.651]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[03:06:21.651 --> 03:06:28.756]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, kidneys, computer vision syndrome, and more.
[03:06:28.756 --> 03:06:34.639]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[03:06:34.639 --> 03:06:35.440]  With regular use,
[03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:42.763]  People using CAN-C drops report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days, and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[03:06:42.763 --> 03:07:00.611]  CAN-C, that's CAN dash letter C, is available now by calling 888-212-8871, that's 888-212-8871, or order online at Nutrimedical.com, that's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com, your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[03:07:01.553 --> 03:07:05.076]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.076 --> 03:07:10.480]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.480 --> 03:07:15.625]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:15.625 --> 03:07:26.754]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:07:27.134 --> 03:07:32.918]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:32.918 --> 03:07:39.181]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:07:39.181 --> 03:07:40.222]  What about you?
[03:07:40.222 --> 03:07:46.666]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:08:02.462 --> 03:08:08.049]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.380 --> 03:08:18.082]  Alright, John, Bradley, Leo, John, Jim and others, your calls are coming up when we come in at the 24 after break.
[03:08:18.082 --> 03:08:22.063]  We're going right through your calls and at the end of the show, I'm going to play this audio.
[03:08:22.063 --> 03:08:32.045]  There's a whole bunch of these, but they are coming after the First Amendment, because that's Al Qaeda too, with the fairness doctrine for the web, talk radio, you name it.
[03:08:32.045 --> 03:08:34.806]  They mean business, it's all part of the Violent Radicalization Act.
[03:08:35.666 --> 03:08:37.848]  And a lot more, so you'll hear from a U.S.
[03:08:37.848 --> 03:08:56.341]  Senator coming up, but I've only had him on once, about three or four months ago, and I wanted to get him back on because we've got a lot of questions from listeners out there about how does a box the size of a water cooler without the water bottle on top produce seven and a half gallons of water a day in normal humidity?
[03:08:57.785 --> 03:08:59.946]  It produces water in the desert.
[03:08:59.946 --> 03:09:00.746]  How does that work?
[03:09:00.746 --> 03:09:12.531]  So we have the founder of A Cola Blue, the designer, and he is also, of course, the individual who we have on air with us.
[03:09:12.531 --> 03:09:15.292]  So he's perfect to be able to discuss all these things.
[03:09:15.292 --> 03:09:17.053]  And he's Tyler Palmer.
[03:09:17.053 --> 03:09:19.614]  Tyler, I appreciate you coming on with us.
[03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:22.956]  Well, thank you, Alex, and I appreciate being able to come on again.
[03:09:22.956 --> 03:09:25.337]  It was a pleasure talking to you the last time.
[03:09:27.459 --> 03:09:32.876]  Again, it's wonderful to be able to explain the technology to all the people listening.
[03:09:33.860 --> 03:09:41.002]  Okay, break down how an atmospheric water generator works, and then it also has filters in it after it grabs the water out of the air.
[03:09:41.002 --> 03:09:51.125]  I know the media has said that carbon dioxide that makes up most of water and water vapors is toxic waste, but I mean, you know, the clouds are the water, and there is water in the air.
[03:09:51.125 --> 03:09:53.266]  It's not with al-Qaeda.
[03:09:53.266 --> 03:10:00.889]  I know they want to put a tax on it, but explain to us how you grab this al-Qaeda out of the atmosphere so people can drink it.
[03:10:03.007 --> 03:10:19.491]  If anyone's ever sat and enjoyed a cold drink on a hot day, they've probably noticed that maybe their wives or girlfriends will say to you, use a coaster, you know, put the coaster below the drink, or... You mean enjoying a cold glass of Al-Qaeda?
[03:10:19.491 --> 03:10:28.313]  Right, a cold glass of Al-Qaeda, because on the exterior of the glass, there's moisture that's condensing, and that moisture
[03:10:29.697 --> 03:10:33.420]  Is the ambient moisture that's in all air.
[03:10:33.420 --> 03:10:42.248]  It doesn't matter if it's the desert or if it's in the polar, in the northern polar regions, there's moisture in the air.
[03:10:42.248 --> 03:10:57.040]  And our machine condenses that water vapor and filters that condensate and makes it potable drinking water that you can have at your home and control.
[03:10:58.660 --> 03:11:02.689]  Uh, so that, uh, you know, here in California where I am.
[03:11:03.314 --> 03:11:05.315]  We now have mandatory rationing.
[03:11:33.394 --> 03:11:34.855]  Yes.
[03:11:34.855 --> 03:11:51.303]  We have plenty of people in apartments and in rural areas who use the machines and they get all their drinking water needs met by this one little device that's about the size of a water cooler, like you said.
[03:11:51.303 --> 03:11:53.984]  And if you plug it into a solar panel, you can be off the grid.
[03:11:55.450 --> 03:12:05.537]  Right, you can be off the grid in all ways, you know, in terms of electricity, if you have solar, and then now with water you can be off the grid.
[03:12:05.537 --> 03:12:09.680]  So, you can be your own independent al-Qaeda production unit.
[03:12:10.222 --> 03:12:10.823]  Yeah, I know.
[03:12:10.823 --> 03:12:12.544]  This is kind of terroristic.
[03:12:12.544 --> 03:12:17.068]  Having a garden, having a water purification out of the air, having your own power.
[03:12:17.068 --> 03:12:20.591]  That could be... You could do some crimes with power.
[03:12:20.591 --> 03:12:23.253]  You could electrocute somebody.
[03:12:23.253 --> 03:12:25.295]  Just like they want to register guns for everybody's safety.
[03:12:25.295 --> 03:12:26.736]  Because, you know, guns are what are evil.
[03:12:26.736 --> 03:12:27.917]  Well, electricity is evil.
[03:12:27.917 --> 03:12:31.881]  You could put wires in the wall and run outside with wires and shock somebody.
[03:12:31.881 --> 03:12:33.142]  So we've got to ban electricity.
[03:12:33.402 --> 03:12:34.343]  Right.
[03:12:34.343 --> 03:12:39.726]  Well, water will soon be evil, too, if it's not delivered by the municipality.
[03:12:39.726 --> 03:12:41.007]  What do you mean, soon?
[03:12:41.007 --> 03:12:46.151]  I mean, to be serious, there's ads everywhere demonizing bottled water, saying drink your tap, it's healthy.
[03:12:46.151 --> 03:12:51.495]  There's ads telling us the mercury-filled, literally mercury-filled high fructose corn syrup is wonderful.
[03:12:51.495 --> 03:12:55.277]  There's ads telling us, I mean, so yeah, no, no, we need to get off the grid.
[03:12:55.277 --> 03:12:59.300]  Yeah, and our technology and our company
[03:12:59.841 --> 03:13:04.785]  really wants to help people to be off the grid and be self-sufficient.
[03:13:04.785 --> 03:13:20.316]  And we see this, like, in addition to having your own garden, your own firearms, and your own energy source, your own water now.
[03:13:20.316 --> 03:13:23.158]  It completes the cycle.
[03:13:23.158 --> 03:13:25.920]  Of course, storable food is important.
[03:13:27.738 --> 03:13:29.128]  Right.
[03:13:29.128 --> 03:13:29.934]  If you have water...
[03:13:31.476 --> 03:13:35.599]  You know, you can go on for an indefinite period.
[03:13:35.599 --> 03:13:36.480]  We can't have that.
[03:13:36.480 --> 03:13:39.562]  I mean, you could commit a crime if you had enough water to drink.
[03:13:39.562 --> 03:13:40.162]  Right.
[03:13:40.162 --> 03:13:42.023]  You've got to only have the government give it to you.
[03:13:42.023 --> 03:13:44.645]  If you've been good, you'll be in a little pit cage.
[03:13:44.645 --> 03:13:46.266]  And if you've been good like a monkey, they'll feed you.
[03:13:46.266 --> 03:13:47.727]  I mean, let's get serious, though.
[03:13:47.727 --> 03:13:51.209]  It is important to get off the grid, but more importantly, this produces a lot of water.
[03:13:51.209 --> 03:13:52.550]  Even in the desert, a lot of water.
[03:13:52.550 --> 03:13:55.152]  You have bigger units for people that have larger needs.
[03:13:55.152 --> 03:13:56.693]  Very affordable.
[03:13:56.693 --> 03:14:00.195]  And the great part is, it goes through all these other filtration systems inside.
[03:14:00.879 --> 03:14:01.519]  Right.
[03:14:01.519 --> 03:14:06.542]  We have several different filtration systems.
[03:14:06.542 --> 03:14:13.706]  Chief amongst them is the activated carbon that is impregnated with silver.
[03:14:13.706 --> 03:14:19.669]  And as many people know, silver is a natural antimicrobial... Wait a minute!
[03:14:19.669 --> 03:14:20.250]  Impregnated?
[03:14:20.250 --> 03:14:22.591]  There's too many people on the planet!
[03:14:22.591 --> 03:14:23.972]  That's another climate crime!
[03:14:24.639 --> 03:14:27.221]  Well, it's a chemical term.
[03:14:27.221 --> 03:14:31.504]  No, I understand, but it's a joke.
[03:14:31.504 --> 03:14:52.520]  So, we have the activated carbon filters, and then we also have UV lights in the system, 245 nanometer UV lights, which are, in a sense, it completely, if there's any bacteria in there, let's say it's RNA is
[03:14:53.564 --> 03:15:01.046]  It's stopped from reproducing and it just wipes out all the bacteria that could be in the water.
[03:15:01.046 --> 03:15:01.866]  I don't know.
[03:15:01.866 --> 03:15:10.809]  I think I'm going to drink big healthy glasses of municipal tap water full of mercury, lead, arsenic, chlorine, sodium, fluoride, and then all the dead bacteria just kills those.
[03:15:10.809 --> 03:15:12.990]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:15.670]  Why are you an extremist?
[03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:20.592]  Toilet to tap in many major cities, drinking sewage water that's been burned with chemicals
[03:15:21.232 --> 03:15:22.633]  That sounds delicious!
[03:15:22.633 --> 03:15:27.176]  I mean, sir, do you have some kind of authority problem?
[03:15:27.176 --> 03:15:36.061]  You know, they've got mental illness designations now for people that think they need to be self-sufficient and people that don't trust the government or don't trust toilet water?
[03:15:36.061 --> 03:15:37.402]  Sewage?
[03:15:37.402 --> 03:15:39.564]  You don't want reclaimed sewage?
[03:15:39.564 --> 03:15:46.168]  Well, yeah, I mean, I may be anti-establishment and have trouble with authority, but
[03:15:46.696 --> 03:15:48.839]  I just don't like the taste of sewage.
[03:15:48.839 --> 03:15:52.403]  I mean, call me crazy, but... Well, you know what?
[03:15:52.403 --> 03:15:53.624]  I'm going to keep drinking sewage water.
[03:15:53.624 --> 03:15:56.848]  I don't think people should call and get a... No, getting serious.
[03:15:56.848 --> 03:15:57.910]  This is awesome, folks.
[03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:58.570]  This is awesome.
[03:15:58.570 --> 03:16:00.272]  I've got one at my house.
[03:16:00.272 --> 03:16:01.193]  My friends have been getting it.
[03:16:01.193 --> 03:16:02.615]  We've got one at the office here.
[03:16:03.539 --> 03:16:05.280]  You need to get into Cola Blue.
[03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:06.861]  You won't believe how great these units are.
[03:16:06.861 --> 03:16:09.042]  And you've got them in a bunch of different colors.
[03:16:09.042 --> 03:16:13.685]  I've got a black one here at the office, a black one at home, and we've got another green one.
[03:16:13.685 --> 03:16:16.246]  And let's give people the website.
[03:16:16.246 --> 03:16:20.148]  It's acolablue.com.
[03:16:20.148 --> 03:16:21.549]  What about a phone number?
[03:16:21.549 --> 03:16:22.710]  The phone number is 800-691-6043.
[03:16:22.710 --> 03:16:25.111]  And we have a new call center.
[03:16:31.059 --> 03:16:39.408]  There's some folks there, Charmaine, Jim, Tim, Travis, and Roy, who will take your phone call.
[03:16:39.408 --> 03:16:43.313]  And then after hours, we have our other number, the 866-585-4044 number.
[03:16:47.324 --> 03:16:55.391]  But if you want to speak to us in the office, that 800-691-6043 number is the way to do it.
[03:16:55.391 --> 03:16:56.893]  And you've got brochures and material.
[03:16:56.893 --> 03:17:00.296]  You've got a bunch of other products, too, on the Ecolablue website.
[03:17:00.296 --> 03:17:02.698]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E-D-O-T-C-O-M.
[03:17:02.698 --> 03:17:06.241]  And all silliness aside, this is a great unit.
[03:17:06.241 --> 03:17:10.105]  There's some other stuff out there, but this is the best one we found, especially for the price.
[03:17:10.105 --> 03:17:10.906]  Gorgeous unit.
[03:17:11.406 --> 03:17:13.648]  And it's high-tech.
[03:17:13.648 --> 03:17:15.289]  I mean, everything's controlled there.
[03:17:15.289 --> 03:17:17.190]  You've got hot water that comes out of it, too.
[03:17:17.190 --> 03:17:19.311]  Tell folks about the control panel.
[03:17:19.311 --> 03:17:19.872]  Right.
[03:17:19.872 --> 03:17:21.793]  It really is state-of-the-art.
[03:17:21.793 --> 03:17:35.301]  And it comes in, to follow up on the colors, we have gray, black, well, silver, black, red, green, and white, and a blue one.
[03:17:35.301 --> 03:17:40.745]  And the LCD screen, it has a little computer on it.
[03:17:41.201 --> 03:17:45.284]  And it monitors the temperature of the hot and cold water tank.
[03:17:45.284 --> 03:17:47.685]  There are two separate tanks on there.
[03:17:47.685 --> 03:17:54.389]  The hot water tank will heat the water up to 199 degrees Fahrenheit.
[03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:58.712]  And it'll heat it as little as 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
[03:17:58.712 --> 03:18:03.555]  And then the cold water side will chill it to 39 degrees Fahrenheit.
[03:18:04.210 --> 03:18:07.212]  And all the way up to about 54 Fahrenheit.
[03:18:07.212 --> 03:18:21.582]  Now you can toggle those and turn them off and have it just be the room temperature, but I think it's better tasting and more effective to have hot water when you need it and cold water.
[03:18:21.582 --> 03:18:28.067]  All other water, even if we put it through a filter, which is still good, comes downstream through all the cities and towns, the runoff.
[03:18:28.067 --> 03:18:31.709]  When you're getting out of the air, it's about as clean as it gets and then it goes through filters.
[03:18:33.010 --> 03:18:34.351]  Beat this water 800-691-6043 800-691-6043 after hours.
[03:18:34.351 --> 03:18:35.292]  Call tonight folks.
[03:18:35.292 --> 03:18:37.674]  Don't procrastinate 866-585-4044 866-585-4044 or ecolloblue.com That's correct.
[03:18:37.674 --> 03:18:43.018]  And also I'd like to tell your listeners, and this is just for Alex Jones listeners, we're going to offer any color machine
[03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:13.777]  Of the Ecolo Blue Model 28 for $1,250 with free shipping and that's all the way up until Valentine's Day.
[03:19:13.777 --> 03:19:14.938]  So what is that?

[03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:18.840]  Yeah.
[03:19:18.840 --> 03:19:21.542]  That's $400 off then?
[03:19:21.542 --> 03:19:22.783]  Essentially, yeah.
[03:19:22.783 --> 03:19:25.444]  That's what it sounds like to me.
[03:19:25.444 --> 03:19:27.285]  $800, $691, $60, $43.
[03:19:27.285 --> 03:19:29.667]  And what about Alex Jones listeners going to Colorblue.com?
[03:19:29.667 --> 03:19:31.048]  Do they just tell them that when they go there?
[03:19:31.528 --> 03:19:36.850]  Right, just mention the show and you'll get the discount.
[03:19:36.850 --> 03:19:40.872]  Alright, well, sir, it has been super having you on, Mr. Palmer.

[03:19:53.176 --> 03:19:56.317]  We were just covering how evil it is to get clean water today.
[03:19:56.317 --> 03:19:58.318]  And I think folks, we really should give you a call.
[03:19:58.318 --> 03:19:59.278]  Take care.
[03:19:59.278 --> 03:20:00.059]  Thank you, Alex.

[03:21:02.094 --> 03:21:07.799]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:21:07.799 --> 03:21:09.100]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:09.100 --> 03:21:11.142]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:11.142 --> 03:21:18.168]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:18.168 --> 03:21:26.695]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:27.059 --> 03:21:34.164]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:34.164 --> 03:21:37.346]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:37.346 --> 03:21:43.111]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[03:24:20.988 --> 03:24:22.729]  It's really happening.
[03:24:22.729 --> 03:24:26.471]  They swore they wouldn't do it, but of course they're moving ahead with the legislation.
[03:24:26.471 --> 03:24:29.432]  They are a nasty group of little creatures.
[03:24:29.432 --> 03:24:33.335]  Let's talk to Aaron in California, then Peter, Bradley, Leo, Jim, and others.
[03:24:33.335 --> 03:24:35.436]  Aaron, you are on the air, sir.
[03:24:36.580 --> 03:24:37.701]  How's it going, Alex?

[03:24:43.803 --> 03:24:45.284]  Thank you.
[03:24:45.284 --> 03:24:47.745]  And I just wanted to throw out a real quick YouTube plug.
[03:24:47.745 --> 03:24:51.246]  Two channels, not so much 524 and Here in the Light of Day.
[03:24:51.246 --> 03:24:57.128]  You know, we gather up videos and everything from all across the internet, and piece them all together for everybody to watch.
[03:24:57.128 --> 03:24:58.749]  Excellent.
[03:24:58.749 --> 03:25:03.691]  But what I really wanted to talk to you about was more local posse comitatus violations.
[03:25:06.966 --> 03:25:11.047]  I'm sorry, you're out in California where the Marines run checkpoints with the police for DWIs.
[03:25:11.047 --> 03:25:12.648]  Go ahead.
[03:25:12.648 --> 03:25:22.271]  Actually, I am in the Monterey Bay area and what we have going on here is supposedly from what the police and the mainstream media tell us is that it's a gang war.
[03:25:22.271 --> 03:25:26.633]  Well, our mayor has been completely ineffectual in trying to combat this.
[03:25:26.633 --> 03:25:29.854]  He's tried to organize fasts and other
[03:25:30.473 --> 03:25:35.134]  Real new age type stuff to help, you know, gather awareness in the community.
[03:25:35.134 --> 03:25:39.616]  But the only thing that's happened is just made crime worse around here.
[03:25:39.616 --> 03:25:47.538]  Well, society's imploding and as the economy goes to hell in a handbasket, it's only going to get worse and they've, you know, they've made shoot-em-ups the culture.
[03:25:47.538 --> 03:25:51.499]  There's a... Well, I mean, keep talking about it.
[03:25:51.499 --> 03:25:52.759]  Go ahead and talk about Posse Comitatus.
[03:25:52.759 --> 03:25:53.839]  I'm finding a clip.
[03:25:53.839 --> 03:25:56.860]  They just did big urban warfare drills again with black helicopters.
[03:25:56.860 --> 03:25:58.941]  Mainstream news in Louisiana.
[03:25:58.941 --> 03:25:59.261]  Go ahead.
[03:26:00.474 --> 03:26:13.541]  Yeah, what's the kicker though is that now the mayor has gotten the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey involved in searching for evidence and gathering new strategies to help combat this so-called gang war problem.
[03:26:13.541 --> 03:26:16.603]  Well, that's what Governor McGoiver said three or four months ago before he got into all this trouble.
[03:26:16.603 --> 03:26:21.305]  He said, we're going to use the National Guard to help us get the guns off the streets.
[03:26:21.305 --> 03:26:25.127]  So, again, who specifically in the military?
[03:26:25.127 --> 03:26:26.268]  The Naval Postgraduate School.
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:31.061]  Naval postgraduate school.
[03:26:31.061 --> 03:26:33.601]  Yeah, well, I mean, this is the way to introduce it to the public.
[03:26:33.601 --> 03:26:42.783]  Through the threat integration centers, the FEMA centers, and this is announced, by the way, in the FEMA camp bill, they're going to have military, police, everybody together, quote, just helping.
[03:26:42.783 --> 03:26:44.124]  Well, we're just helping.
[03:26:44.124 --> 03:26:45.724]  The Army's just here at a car wreck.
[03:26:45.724 --> 03:26:46.944]  They say that.
[03:26:46.944 --> 03:26:49.625]  You're against the Army helping at a car wreck?
[03:26:49.625 --> 03:26:53.146]  But again, it's to sell the idea and set the precedent.
[03:26:53.146 --> 03:26:53.726]  Exactly.
[03:26:53.726 --> 03:26:57.667]  And I mean, that's the thing that kills me most about these, you know, the citizens around here in this town.
[03:26:58.095 --> 03:27:02.898]  Everybody just, you know, there are more sheep out there bleeding Obama.
[03:27:02.898 --> 03:27:05.259]  Obama!
[03:27:05.259 --> 03:27:07.361]  Obama!
[03:27:07.361 --> 03:27:09.902]  But wait, he said the torture continues, a secret arrest.
[03:27:09.902 --> 03:27:12.184]  No liar!
[03:27:12.184 --> 03:27:13.965]  But wait, he's actually for the banker bailout.
[03:27:13.965 --> 03:27:15.026]  No!
[03:27:15.026 --> 03:27:16.466]  Bush did it!
[03:27:16.466 --> 03:27:17.347]  Well, yes, they both did it.
[03:27:17.347 --> 03:27:18.067]  They're both together.
[03:27:18.067 --> 03:27:19.188]  No!
[03:27:19.188 --> 03:27:21.329]  Well, he's actually briefing up troops in the Middle East.
[03:27:21.329 --> 03:27:22.810]  No!
[03:27:22.810 --> 03:27:25.732]  Well, he's appointing all these criminals from the banks who don't pay taxes.
[03:27:25.732 --> 03:27:26.012]  No!
[03:27:28.323 --> 03:27:29.925]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:27:29.925 --> 03:27:30.805]  No, that's fine.
[03:27:30.805 --> 03:27:32.627]  That was actually great.
[03:27:32.627 --> 03:27:40.715]  Basically, what I'm trying to do now here in my community is really raise the constitutional awareness of what's going on with these events.
[03:27:40.715 --> 03:27:42.617]  This is a precursor to martial law.
[03:27:42.617 --> 03:27:46.220]  Well, we're already under martial law.
[03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:50.124]  It's physical martial law on the ground, another degree in the Richter scale.
[03:27:51.597 --> 03:27:52.558]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:27:52.558 --> 03:27:53.738]  I agree with you 100%.
[03:27:53.738 --> 03:27:57.159]  In fact, speaking of the devil, Paul Watson did an article based on mainstream reports.
[03:27:57.159 --> 03:27:57.359]  U.S.
[03:27:57.359 --> 03:28:00.381]  troops and black helicopters invade New Orleans, drop bombs.
[03:28:00.381 --> 03:28:08.304]  This has happened so many thousands of times around the country that now I don't even cover it when I used to run around hiding in the bushes to videotape it and people would deny it was going on.
[03:28:08.304 --> 03:28:09.904]  Go to InfoWars, guys.
[03:28:09.904 --> 03:28:16.867]  It's the bottom story in News in Focus, the bottom story in Featured Stories, and I want to put that up on the screen.
[03:28:16.867 --> 03:28:17.667]  Anything else?
[03:28:17.667 --> 03:28:19.068]  So what's the public think about having
[03:28:20.057 --> 03:28:20.698]  The Navy there.
[03:28:20.698 --> 03:28:23.440]  You know, the Navy's creating its own private army now.
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:24.561]  Uh, you know, that's right.
[03:28:24.561 --> 03:28:31.907]  And, uh, you know, the Defense Language Institute and the Naval Postgraduate School, you know, they're one of the premier anti-terrorism facilities in the military today.
[03:28:31.907 --> 03:28:37.772]  Well, the, uh, the Monterey Bay facility trained the terrorists and their own head of it came out and said that.
[03:28:37.772 --> 03:28:39.533]  That's, that's right, exactly.
[03:28:39.533 --> 03:28:42.536]  Colonel Butler.
[03:28:42.536 --> 03:28:45.178]  But who cares about Colonel Butler when you can say Obama?
[03:28:49.582 --> 03:28:54.405]  You know, it's really funny too, because I'm actually a former service member myself.
[03:28:54.405 --> 03:29:05.511]  I was in the Navy for a few years, and now that I'm out and I've been woken up and I see everything that's going on, I'm really glad that I'm not in the military anymore.
[03:29:05.511 --> 03:29:07.792]  It's just against everything I believe in, what they're doing now.
[03:29:07.792 --> 03:29:09.113]  It's horrible.
[03:29:09.113 --> 03:29:13.575]  Well, you know, they're running these TV ads where they equate the new military with George Washington.
[03:29:13.575 --> 03:29:15.957]  George Washington was fighting what our military has become.
[03:29:16.866 --> 03:29:20.009]  And so it's not our military anymore, it's not our government anymore.
[03:29:20.009 --> 03:29:23.353]  And I'm just sad that good men and women are joining it, because they're going to be used.
[03:29:23.353 --> 03:29:24.895]  Go ahead.
[03:29:24.895 --> 03:29:35.546]  Just to kind of parallel what you said right there, you know, our mayor now, with this whole gang war and this exponential increase in violence, he's equating it to a low-grade 9-11.
[03:29:35.546 --> 03:29:38.389]  And that just, that curdled my blood when I heard that.
[03:29:38.809 --> 03:29:39.909]  Oh, everything's a 9-11.
[03:29:39.909 --> 03:29:42.630]  The financial collapse, they engineered to 9-11.
[03:29:42.630 --> 03:29:45.810]  And yeah, the crime race is gonna explode, they're gonna come with the gun control.
[03:29:45.810 --> 03:29:51.712]  Get ready, the bills are introduced, they're coming for your guns, we'll be right back.
[03:29:51.712 --> 03:29:55.632]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.632 --> 03:30:02.714]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.714 --> 03:30:03.794]  Hi, this is Steve Shane.
[03:30:08.377 --> 03:30:19.361]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[03:30:42.102 --> 03:30:45.523]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[03:30:45.523 --> 03:30:49.084]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[03:30:49.084 --> 03:30:51.825]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:51.825 --> 03:30:54.026]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:01.536 --> 03:31:08.318]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:08.318 --> 03:31:10.958]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:10.958 --> 03:31:12.499]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:12.499 --> 03:31:13.299]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:13.299 --> 03:31:14.239]  This is his ammo.
[03:31:14.239 --> 03:31:15.659]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:15.659 --> 03:31:17.660]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:17.660 --> 03:31:24.801]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:24.801 --> 03:31:25.282]  Some U.S.
[03:31:25.282 --> 03:31:30.943]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:31.643 --> 03:31:35.164]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:35.164 --> 03:31:37.925]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:01.516 --> 03:32:12.106]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:32:12.106 --> 03:32:13.508]  Garden in a Can.
[03:32:13.508 --> 03:32:17.652]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[03:32:17.652 --> 03:32:19.674]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[03:32:19.674 --> 03:32:21.976]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[03:32:32.119 --> 03:32:33.540]  Garden in a can.
[03:32:33.540 --> 03:32:34.740]  It's that simple.
[03:32:34.740 --> 03:32:35.441]  Fresh.
[03:32:35.441 --> 03:32:36.301]  Healthy.
[03:32:36.301 --> 03:32:37.141]  Easy.

[03:33:11.890 --> 03:33:17.353]  Oh, here I come now, baby!
[03:33:17.353 --> 03:33:20.734]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby!
[03:33:20.734 --> 03:33:28.018]  Come on, come on, come on!
[03:33:28.018 --> 03:33:29.318]  You know, I feel good about my life.
[03:33:29.318 --> 03:33:35.421]  Whatever happens in all of this, whatever happens to all you great folks out there that hate tyranny and love liberty, at least we know we're fighting hard.
[03:33:35.421 --> 03:33:36.282]  At least we know we're right.
[03:33:37.489 --> 03:33:41.671]  The guys were just talking about Obama last night in a big rampaging, ranting speech.
[03:33:41.671 --> 03:33:46.114]  I saw part of it in and back and forth in the editing room as we're working on the Obama film.
[03:33:46.114 --> 03:33:48.115]  And he was just saying, what do you think a stimulus is?
[03:33:48.115 --> 03:33:51.416]  Everybody's like standing ovations and everyone's getting all heated and angry.
[03:33:51.416 --> 03:33:53.638]  And I just love the American people so much.
[03:33:53.638 --> 03:33:57.259]  If we don't turn this around, it's going to be a catastrophe.
[03:33:57.259 --> 03:34:01.622]  And people are just like, oh, he cares so much because they're killing the economy.
[03:34:01.622 --> 03:34:03.803]  Not Obama, people that run things.
[03:34:03.803 --> 03:34:04.643]  Bush didn't run things.
[03:34:04.643 --> 03:34:05.604]  Get past the puppet.
[03:34:06.064 --> 03:34:13.767]  We've got a graphic in the film where it's Obama's face and you zoom right into his eye and you go behind that and it's the Bilderberg Group and the New World Order.
[03:34:13.767 --> 03:34:22.571]  We've got another one where the curtains part and they pull Bush aside and put Obama in and behind the next curtain is the New World Order.
[03:34:22.571 --> 03:34:26.613]  So he's like, I care so much about you, I'm so mad at these bankers!
[03:34:26.613 --> 03:34:30.755]  And meanwhile he's bankrolled by all of them and he isn't putting salary caps on them and it's all bull.
[03:34:32.746 --> 03:34:35.787]  Oh, man, it is just insane to see all of this going.
[03:34:35.787 --> 03:34:37.988]  Oh, I'm so concerned about you.
[03:34:37.988 --> 03:34:40.149]  Oh, I just care about you so much.
[03:34:40.149 --> 03:34:50.314]  Oh, I'm just gonna... I mean, compare this great acting and this slickness, and he's smart and everything, compared to Bush, I mean, yes, but Bush was a puppet, too.
[03:34:50.314 --> 03:34:51.874]  And I know I keep saying that.
[03:34:51.874 --> 03:34:53.655]  I know you, the listeners, know that.
[03:34:53.655 --> 03:34:55.576]  What about the general public?
[03:34:55.576 --> 03:34:56.856]  How do we reach out to these people?
[03:34:56.856 --> 03:34:59.197]  Here's Paul Watson's story, then I'm going back to your calls.
[03:34:59.197 --> 03:34:59.418]  U.S.
[03:34:59.418 --> 03:34:59.958]  troops and black
[03:35:00.578 --> 03:35:04.359]  Helicopters invade New Orleans, drop bombs.
[03:35:04.359 --> 03:35:06.259]  That's right.
[03:35:06.259 --> 03:35:07.599]  All the years this didn't exist.
[03:35:07.599 --> 03:35:15.601]  They'd do terror drills and not announce it to the media and then there'd be smoking buildings and the media would say, did not happen, it's all lies, the public's insane.
[03:35:15.601 --> 03:35:18.922]  That was a PSYOP, covered in my police state films.
[03:35:18.922 --> 03:35:24.383]  But now it just goes into all of it.
[03:35:24.383 --> 03:35:25.043]  Oh my goodness.
[03:35:27.145 --> 03:35:31.226]  Well, anyways, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[03:35:31.226 --> 03:35:34.347]  Let us go back to your phone calls, because I want to get into the Fairness Doctrine.
[03:35:34.347 --> 03:35:38.149]  Peter NPA, you are on the air, sir.
[03:35:38.149 --> 03:35:39.249]  Hi, Alex.
[03:35:39.249 --> 03:35:40.409]  Long time listener.
[03:35:40.409 --> 03:35:42.170]  Started as a young buck on the short wave.
[03:35:42.170 --> 03:35:43.711]  Just want to say thank you.
[03:35:43.711 --> 03:35:44.891]  I salute you, Peter.
[03:35:44.891 --> 03:35:45.671]  What's up?
[03:35:45.671 --> 03:35:46.231]  Thank you, sir.
[03:35:46.231 --> 03:35:48.452]  Well, a couple things I'd like to address real quick.
[03:35:48.452 --> 03:35:50.433]  I wonder if anybody notices that
[03:35:51.900 --> 03:35:58.724]  I don't know if it's a civil war that's brewing or what, I mean, with the eight states and Vermont looking to succeed.
[03:35:58.724 --> 03:36:04.587]  I don't think anybody's even noticed the similarities between Barack Obama and Abe Lincoln, the civil war.
[03:36:04.587 --> 03:36:06.028]  No, no, no, he knows!
[03:36:06.028 --> 03:36:08.809]  Listen, listen, they've got psych warfare war games.
[03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:11.111]  The Pentagon admits of how society will break down.
[03:36:11.111 --> 03:36:12.752]  The first place I read about the U.S.
[03:36:12.752 --> 03:36:20.496]  breaking up was ten years ago in a Pentagon prospectus saying they believed it was going to happen, but they want to break us up so the globalists can take us over into the Union.
[03:36:21.244 --> 03:36:22.926]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[03:36:22.926 --> 03:36:25.449]  That was my next step.
[03:36:25.449 --> 03:36:27.411]  Let me tell you, this is too important.
[03:36:27.411 --> 03:36:30.755]  Kurt Nimmo did an article on this yesterday.
[03:36:30.755 --> 03:36:35.881]  They know, after federalizing things and bankrupting the states by design, that things are going to fall apart.
[03:36:35.881 --> 03:36:38.503]  We're talking insane times we're going into, folks.
[03:36:38.503 --> 03:36:41.967]  Almost no way to avert it, because they're honchoing it, making sure it's happening.
[03:36:44.141 --> 03:36:50.827]  What you have to understand is that they understand the people are going to revolt at the state level and try to bring in liberty.
[03:36:50.827 --> 03:37:02.838]  They know the people are going to demand that Madoff and the rest of them actually be punished, and so that's what NORTHCOM does is actually block the states, and then they're comparing Lincoln and everything that happened with what Obama's going to do.
[03:37:02.838 --> 03:37:07.522]  So when he says, I'm going to be like Lincoln, he means that he's going to have the feds occupy everything.
[03:37:07.522 --> 03:37:10.084]  But absolutely, it's all scripted.
[03:37:10.084 --> 03:37:10.425]  Go ahead.
[03:37:11.207 --> 03:37:17.050]  Oh, I mean, on that topic, just quickly, I want to touch on, I have a good buddy, I'm going to call him the Rebazor.
[03:37:17.050 --> 03:37:18.991]  He, uh, he was in the military.
[03:37:18.991 --> 03:37:22.992]  He is so fed up that he's ready to hit Montana with his guns.
[03:37:22.992 --> 03:37:30.036]  But, I mean, what I'm saying, as far as that goes, is people look at Lincoln like Lincoln was a good president.
[03:37:30.036 --> 03:37:30.436]  Okay?
[03:37:30.436 --> 03:37:32.557]  Habeas Corpus, gone.
[03:37:32.557 --> 03:37:33.057]  Camp, dead.
[03:37:33.057 --> 03:37:35.058]  Let's explain what happened, for those that don't know.
[03:37:36.369 --> 03:37:38.950]  And I've read the writings of Lincoln, I've studied it.
[03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:42.131]  Lincoln wasn't bad, the South wasn't bad.
[03:37:42.131 --> 03:37:43.372]  Now let me explain what happened.
[03:37:43.372 --> 03:37:49.374]  This is mainline history, but it's not taught in school, but in real scholarly history books it's admitted.
[03:37:49.374 --> 03:37:55.116]  Now listen, the British had lost the war in the 1780s, started in 1776.
[03:37:55.116 --> 03:38:00.578]  They came in to their agent, Alexander Hamilton,
[03:38:02.312 --> 03:38:05.194]  Uh, who Mr. Burr then killed, and they said, step outside.
[03:38:05.194 --> 03:38:06.694]  Back then, they said, step outside, punk.
[03:38:06.694 --> 03:38:08.695]  And he went out and shot, you know, he killed him.
[03:38:08.695 --> 03:38:09.836]  Uh, in a duel.
[03:38:09.836 --> 03:38:15.679]  And he wanted to make George Washington king, he wanted to set up a new banking elite, and they were making deals with the British on the side.
[03:38:15.679 --> 03:38:16.880]  They, they killed him.
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:21.502]  Then they tried with the British, by the turn of the century, 1800, to overthrow the U.S.
[03:38:21.502 --> 03:38:24.784]  There were rebellions, armies marched on the Capitol.
[03:38:25.692 --> 03:38:26.633]  Okay.
[03:38:26.633 --> 03:38:28.314]  Then Andrew Jackson came up later.
[03:38:28.314 --> 03:38:32.056]  Love him or hate him, the point is, he routed the British Banks out.
[03:38:32.056 --> 03:38:33.377]  The British Banks, he gave speeches.
[03:38:33.377 --> 03:38:40.141]  The British Banks went into South Carolina, Georgia, and they said, the North's got taxes on you.
[03:38:40.141 --> 03:38:46.705]  Let's have a rebellion and split off and Britain will let you have the entire South and then into the West.
[03:38:46.705 --> 03:38:54.070]  And so the South, in the 1830s, rebelled and Andrew Jackson had to mass an army
[03:38:55.154 --> 03:38:57.757]  And only because he's from the South, they stood down.
[03:38:57.757 --> 03:38:59.519]  And he said, I'm going to march down there and kick your butt.
[03:38:59.519 --> 03:39:01.202]  This is a British conspiracy.
[03:39:01.202 --> 03:39:02.924]  It was in the newspapers.
[03:39:02.924 --> 03:39:03.985]  So that stopped.
[03:39:03.985 --> 03:39:09.912]  Then, the Civil War wasn't about ending slavery.
[03:39:09.912 --> 03:39:12.996]  It was about controlling Western expansion and taxation.
[03:39:13.817 --> 03:39:16.040]  And representation of the southern states.
[03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:21.506]  And so the British were in the south, funding the rebellion, they brought in the cannons, the weapons, everything.
[03:39:21.506 --> 03:39:32.778]  Then, when the war started, they massed troops in Canada, in Ottawa, and in Toronto, 20,000 of them, and put a fleet off New York, threatening to invade.
[03:39:33.738 --> 03:39:38.980]  So, then the British Tsar sent a fleet for the North to menace them.
[03:39:38.980 --> 03:39:42.241]  That's why later in 1917, the British overthrew their cousins, the Tsars.
[03:39:42.241 --> 03:39:44.641]  That was over that and other issues.
[03:39:44.641 --> 03:39:51.284]  But you're absolutely right that Lincoln wrote all these letters and all these things and said, I do not want to free one slave.
[03:39:51.284 --> 03:39:52.304]  That's not what this is about.
[03:39:53.044 --> 03:39:53.724]  Certainly.
[03:39:53.724 --> 03:39:55.105]  One more thing I'd like to touch on.
[03:40:21.175 --> 03:40:25.817]  You know, the Telegraph, you know, with the PsyApps backslash propaganda conditioning.
[03:40:25.817 --> 03:40:31.539]  I'd also like to touch on the fact everybody thought we were nuts when the playing cards came out.
[03:40:31.539 --> 03:40:36.001]  The NWO cards and the FEMA pamphlets with the World Trade Center in them.
[03:40:36.001 --> 03:40:44.225]  In there, the government flies jumbo jets, blows up the World Trade Center, stages everything they've been doing, and that guy was right here in Austin that made those cards.
[03:40:44.225 --> 03:40:48.947]  I mean, that's... I don't know who that guy was talking to or who he's with, but
[03:40:49.881 --> 03:40:54.223]  I mean, I don't know if you saw the writing on the wall, but I mean, it all ties in.
[03:40:54.223 --> 03:40:58.625]  The Illuminati, they put it out there right for the blind, right down to Walt Disney.
[03:40:58.625 --> 03:40:59.125]  I hear you.
[03:40:59.125 --> 03:41:02.767]  In the Narnia series, the A is the Masonic symbol.
[03:41:02.767 --> 03:41:03.888]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:41:05.163 --> 03:41:11.209]  Sometimes they plant these in pop culture, other times they pick up pop culture ideas and then stage it.
[03:41:11.209 --> 03:41:27.026]  The CIA and the Defense Department, the last time I saw it, the Defense Department alone was spending $48 million a year paying for scripts from the biggest script writing houses in Los Angeles and in Burbank and places of fictional terror attacks.
[03:41:27.866 --> 03:41:31.148]  Hey Alex, it's Brady, but thanks.
[03:41:31.148 --> 03:41:35.911]  Yesterday I had Jason Burmiss on, and he was talking about that game crackdown, and in that game you're a super soldier for the state.
[03:41:35.911 --> 03:41:41.714]  Did you know at the end of that game, the guy that's like your controller actually says,
[03:41:56.786 --> 03:41:58.307]  Do you know who set this all up?
[03:41:58.307 --> 03:41:59.227]  We did it.
[03:41:59.227 --> 03:42:18.875]  And it's like they're throwing it out there blatantly obvious, and most people just... So at the end of the game, they admit that the government started the terror attacks as a pretext to attack the population, and on giant cartoons they're putting in one of the biggest newspapers in the world, the government stages terror attacks to put us all in FEMA camps and bring in the North American Union.
[03:42:18.875 --> 03:42:24.877]  You're telling me that game then, that you've gone to the end of, does like all the other games.
[03:42:24.877 --> 03:42:26.118]  There was another game, Do Sex.
[03:42:26.738 --> 03:42:30.400]  Where at the end of the game you learn the government was staging the terror attacks.
[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:32.400]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[03:42:32.400 --> 03:42:38.823]  So at the end, hold on, at the end the commander calls you in and says good job, we staged the terror attack?
[03:42:38.823 --> 03:42:48.727]  Yeah, at the end of the game you're actually playing the soldier and you're fighting gangs and terrorists and taking out criminals and at the end of the game he goes, well who funded these people?
[03:42:48.727 --> 03:42:49.688]  Well guess who?
[03:42:49.688 --> 03:42:50.328]  It was us.
[03:42:50.328 --> 03:42:52.169]  It was us, the government, the guy that's running you.
[03:42:55.692 --> 03:42:58.553]  And then what else does he say?
[03:42:58.553 --> 03:42:59.374]  That's all I remember.
[03:42:59.374 --> 03:43:00.774]  I played the game about a year ago.
[03:43:00.774 --> 03:43:06.917]  I know through the whole thing that you have unlimited funds, you get all these guns all the time, all you want.
[03:43:06.917 --> 03:43:13.820]  You can jump on buildings and blow stuff up and it's like, they're just shoving it in your face like, here you go.
[03:43:13.820 --> 03:43:15.161]  This is what we're doing.
[03:43:15.161 --> 03:43:21.804]  And these young children are identifying with their tribal warfare programming with walking up and assassinating citizens.
[03:43:21.804 --> 03:43:23.705]  Burma said you go around killing Americans, right?
[03:43:24.261 --> 03:43:25.081]  Yeah, basically.
[03:43:25.081 --> 03:43:30.544]  Well, yeah, because it looks a lot like Seattle or Washington, D.C.
[03:43:30.544 --> 03:43:33.746]  And I guess one quick thing, and I'll get off because I know you're short on time.
[03:43:33.746 --> 03:43:43.672]  I was talking to somebody I know that's in the law enforcement division, and he said that they're trying to secretly or quietly push through gun confiscation, gun bans.
[03:43:43.672 --> 03:43:47.914]  My question is, if they're trying to push it through Congress and they don't have any real power, why don't they just do it?
[03:43:48.885 --> 03:43:49.626]  Well, they are!
[03:43:49.626 --> 03:43:54.189]  They have gun sweeps from the National Guard in Illinois and other places.
[03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:56.751]  They are tracking gun owners.
[03:43:56.751 --> 03:44:02.415]  They've introduced the bills without even, well, just with executive fiat, not even a bill!
[03:44:02.415 --> 03:44:06.057]  They're saying they can just say whoever they want can't own a gun.
[03:44:06.057 --> 03:44:07.438]  I mean, this is it, man!
[03:44:07.438 --> 03:44:15.004]  These are, look, the same banks that funded the Bolsheviks, on record, and the same banks that funded Hitler and Mao and it's now declassified.
[03:44:17.065 --> 03:44:19.070]  In fact, guys, bring it in here to me.
[03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:22.758]  I brought my book, Descent into Tyranny, in and it's got paper shoved in with it.
[03:44:23.649 --> 03:44:24.790]  I think it's laying on the table over there.
[03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:26.951]  It's David Rockefeller quotes.
[03:44:26.951 --> 03:44:28.953]  These are bibliographed, okay?
[03:44:28.953 --> 03:44:31.414]  These quotes I'm putting in the new film for Endgame.
[03:44:31.414 --> 03:44:32.835]  These are quotes I didn't use.
[03:44:32.835 --> 03:44:35.837]  These are quotes that we sent off for the newspapers and went to the library.
[03:44:35.837 --> 03:44:37.879]  These are real quotes.
[03:44:37.879 --> 03:44:41.081]  And in here, he talks about how he doesn't pay taxes.
[03:44:41.081 --> 03:44:49.726]  In here, they say, the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite with world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practice of past centuries.
[03:44:49.726 --> 03:44:52.228]  David Rockefeller and Bilderberg Group address.
[03:44:52.228 --> 03:44:52.848]  He's got other
[03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:58.932]  Sickening quotes in here about all the things they're planning.
[03:44:58.932 --> 03:45:01.754]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:45:01.754 --> 03:45:02.714]  I agree with you.
[03:45:02.714 --> 03:45:12.640]  I'm glad that you woke me up and that Fox News report this morning that we're all crazy and we're idiotic and we have a mental disorder.
[03:45:12.640 --> 03:45:17.682]  I don't think that they understand what's coming out of their own mouths.
[03:45:17.682 --> 03:45:19.483]  Well, I mean, absolutely.
[03:45:19.483 --> 03:45:19.764]  Thank you.
[03:45:20.768 --> 03:45:40.843]  They have different slices of the public, totally dumbed down, can't even talk, pretty much dumbed down, know about cartoons and football, somewhat informed to think they're geniuses, then kind of establishment wonks who think they know more, who are in a left front paradigm, and then evil people who serve the New World Order that really know what's going on, and then the good people.
[03:45:41.875 --> 03:45:43.896]  And so they're servicing different propaganda.
[03:45:43.896 --> 03:45:47.137]  That's why they'll say on shows every day, there is no plan for a world government.
[03:45:47.137 --> 03:45:49.358]  If you say it, you're a child molester.
[03:45:49.358 --> 03:45:50.919]  There is no plan for a world government.
[03:45:50.919 --> 03:45:53.020]  If you say it, it's secret racism code.
[03:45:53.020 --> 03:45:55.601]  There is no plan for a world government or gun confiscation.
[03:45:55.601 --> 03:45:57.081]  If you say it, you're mentally ill.
[03:45:57.081 --> 03:46:00.763]  And they now have mentally ill psychological designations, hundreds of them.
[03:46:01.994 --> 03:46:04.015]  If you believe in a New World Order conspiracy theory.
[03:46:04.015 --> 03:46:05.515]  This is in FBI training manuals.
[03:46:05.515 --> 03:46:06.195]  You're a terrorist.
[03:46:06.195 --> 03:46:07.336]  You're mentally ill.
[03:46:07.336 --> 03:46:17.199]  While then, to a certain segment, the so-called intelligentsia in the Financial Times of London and the Wall Street Journal, they say, world government was kept secret for your own good.
[03:46:17.199 --> 03:46:18.199]  It's here now.
[03:46:18.199 --> 03:46:19.180]  It's going to save you.
[03:46:19.180 --> 03:46:20.700]  This is word for word.
[03:46:20.700 --> 03:46:24.842]  It is dictatorial, but dictatorial is good.
[03:46:24.842 --> 03:46:28.423]  What did David Rockefeller say in that quote?
[03:46:28.423 --> 03:46:28.743]  You see?
[03:46:30.154 --> 03:46:40.941]  So see, for the general public, kids sitting in public school right now, they're watching film clips and stuff, saying New World Order doesn't exist, you're insane if you say it exists, but then their very textbook says it does exist and is good.
[03:46:40.941 --> 03:46:46.045]  That teaches the child double-think, that it's real, but I'm crazy if I talk about it.
[03:46:46.045 --> 03:46:50.308]  This is psychological warfare, hardcore programming.
[03:46:50.308 --> 03:46:51.769]  Leo and Mash, you're on the air.
[03:46:51.769 --> 03:46:55.291]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[03:46:55.291 --> 03:46:58.854]  I'm a subscriber, and number one,
[03:46:59.747 --> 03:47:07.114]  KRS, that long interview, could you put that, could you please, please put that out on YouTube?
[03:47:07.114 --> 03:47:13.139]  I mean, I want to put it out to my list, and I'm worried that when I send it out, they won't be able to access it.
[03:47:13.139 --> 03:47:14.260]  Okay, let me explain something.
[03:47:15.632 --> 03:47:25.798]  We streamed a shorter KSR 1 interview, 20 minutes long, here last week, last Friday, on the PrisonPlanet.tv live stream.
[03:47:25.798 --> 03:47:31.762]  It's got close to 100,000 views, last time I checked, just on one video channel.
[03:47:31.762 --> 03:47:42.508]  We did finally post, in our super high quality for PrisonPlanet.tv members, the longer KSR 1, KRS 1, always got to do that, interview today.
[03:47:42.508 --> 03:47:43.229]  So don't worry,
[03:47:44.569 --> 03:47:49.394]  The PrisonPlanet.tv members will rip it seven ways to Sunday and post it everywhere.
[03:47:49.394 --> 03:47:53.437]  Just being a member, you get first access, higher quality, and you support us.
[03:47:53.437 --> 03:47:55.960]  So it will be on YouTube.
[03:47:55.960 --> 03:47:57.821]  If it isn't already there, it'll be there soon.
[03:47:57.821 --> 03:48:00.924]  Yes, it's a longer interview right now for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[03:48:00.924 --> 03:48:01.765]  Anything else?
[03:48:01.765 --> 03:48:06.810]  Yeah, could you get a translator and some closed captioning so that people can
[03:48:07.725 --> 03:48:10.768]  ...who are about to speak other languages can go into that area.
[03:48:10.768 --> 03:48:13.990]  And it might be a little expensive, but there are a lot of free translators, right?
[03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:15.332]  And the important thing is this.
[03:48:15.332 --> 03:48:27.902]  Yesterday, I noticed somebody was jamming the sound on your video show, and it was coming out... So that's... How long did that go?
[03:48:27.902 --> 03:48:28.783]  Over about half an hour.
[03:48:28.783 --> 03:48:29.244]  I gave up.
[03:48:29.244 --> 03:48:30.305]  I just went on to the flash.
[03:48:30.305 --> 03:48:32.006]  The flash was clean.
[03:48:32.006 --> 03:48:32.306]  Audio.
[03:48:32.306 --> 03:48:33.147]  The flash audio was clean.
[03:48:33.147 --> 03:48:34.348]  I doubt somebody was jamming.
[03:48:34.348 --> 03:48:34.989]  That's probably...
[03:48:35.868 --> 03:48:40.331]  Probably the people in... I want to send you my thing.
[03:48:40.331 --> 03:48:42.252]  I can't find your address anywhere.
[03:48:42.252 --> 03:48:43.752]  What is wrong with your site?
[03:48:43.752 --> 03:48:45.834]  Why is it an abortion basically?
[03:48:45.834 --> 03:48:47.154]  Your site is an abortion.
[03:48:47.154 --> 03:48:50.916]  I cannot find anything because you have all this stuff jammed in.
[03:48:50.916 --> 03:48:58.581]  I don't mind having the advertising, but the rest of the space, could you have like little blocks or little segments so that we can go to whatever segment of the site we want to go to?
[03:48:58.581 --> 03:48:59.922]  My site is an abortion.
[03:48:59.922 --> 03:49:00.282]  Well, that's a...
[03:49:01.207 --> 03:49:02.007]  Thank you.
[03:49:02.007 --> 03:49:04.548]  Thank you.
[03:49:04.548 --> 03:49:08.790]  I try to access your site and I go berserk trying to find simple things.
[03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:10.670]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:15.332]  Sir, you really should check the site every day because 40, 50, 60 things are posted.
[03:49:15.332 --> 03:49:16.612]  It goes into archives.
[03:49:16.612 --> 03:49:17.213]  We went web 2.0.
[03:49:18.953 --> 03:49:22.416]  We're trying to upgrade it, make it work better.
[03:49:22.416 --> 03:49:23.857]  They're very popular sites.
[03:49:23.857 --> 03:49:29.081]  Infowars.com is, you know, thousands of times in ranking bigger than Rush Limbaugh.com.
[03:49:29.081 --> 03:49:32.203]  Look at it on Alexa.com or all those other stat systems.
[03:49:32.203 --> 03:49:33.164]  We're trying our best.
[03:49:33.164 --> 03:49:42.691]  I mean, I can barely make the money to get an extra IT guy and an extra somebody who's an expert on WordPress and Joomla and all these other systems we're using, but we're doing it.
[03:49:42.691 --> 03:49:45.173]  But then you don't want advertisements.
[03:49:45.173 --> 03:49:46.314]  Let me get this straight.
[03:49:46.314 --> 03:49:47.655]  You want me to get
[03:49:49.045 --> 03:49:51.929]  Translators in here.
[03:49:51.929 --> 03:49:55.173]  Maybe they'll work for free for a few days, but the people need to eat.
[03:49:55.173 --> 03:49:59.279]  And then I'm supposed to get translators in here and do it closed captioning.
[03:50:01.263 --> 03:50:03.644]  When I don't have the money.
[03:50:03.644 --> 03:50:11.647]  So, let me take this opportunity to tell you folks, not just that I carry great books and videos of the films I've made at Infowars.com on this online shopping cart.
[03:50:11.647 --> 03:50:13.128]  That's what funds this operation.
[03:50:13.128 --> 03:50:14.688]  So buy a bunch of books and videos.
[03:50:14.688 --> 03:50:16.089]  We're trying to expand.
[03:50:16.089 --> 03:50:29.534]  But I mean, really, when I get told I need to do more, I got home at one o'clock last night from working, and then my wife got sick, and she's sick, and so the baby was waking up at
[03:50:30.305 --> 03:50:37.270]  You know, 530 in the morning I was up with the baby, and then I had to get people to come over so I could leave to come to work.
[03:50:37.270 --> 03:50:40.773]  So I've been feeding babies and changing diapers and then I get here and
[03:50:44.130 --> 03:50:46.332]  I'm directing these possum bellies that work here.
[03:50:46.332 --> 03:50:51.696]  And, uh, you know, I mean, I'm out whining here, but I mean, I am not Superman.
[03:50:51.696 --> 03:50:53.518]  I can't just, like, SHAZAM!
[03:50:53.518 --> 03:50:54.599]  Closed captioning.
[03:50:54.599 --> 03:50:55.399]  SHAZAM!
[03:50:55.399 --> 03:50:56.820]  Website has everything you want.
[03:50:56.820 --> 03:50:57.661]  SHAZAM!
[03:50:57.661 --> 03:50:58.522]  SHAZAM!
[03:50:58.522 --> 03:50:59.863]  But then don't advertise, though.
[03:50:59.863 --> 03:51:00.704]  Do it without money, Alex.
[03:51:01.786 --> 03:51:04.887]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:51:04.887 --> 03:51:10.408]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:51:10.408 --> 03:51:16.130]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:51:16.130 --> 03:51:17.610]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:17.610 --> 03:51:26.493]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[03:51:26.913 --> 03:51:28.754]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:51:28.754 --> 03:51:32.976]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:51:32.976 --> 03:51:37.979]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[03:51:41.821 --> 03:51:42.902]  Keep it natural.

[03:51:46.983 --> 03:51:51.305]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[03:51:56.388 --> 03:52:01.850]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:52:01.850 --> 03:52:04.331]  It is a big idea.
[03:52:04.331 --> 03:52:06.092]  A new world order.
[03:52:06.092 --> 03:52:10.514]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:52:10.982 --> 03:52:13.806]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:13.806 --> 03:52:16.609]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:52:16.609 --> 03:52:19.774]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:19.774 --> 03:52:27.103]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:30.134 --> 03:52:35.558]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:35.558 --> 03:52:39.440]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:41.982]  Build a barrier to make great progress for the world government.
[03:52:41.982 --> 03:52:43.183]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:43.183 --> 03:52:43.963]  They're not after money.
[03:52:43.963 --> 03:52:45.244]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:45.244 --> 03:52:46.205]  They're after power.
[03:52:46.205 --> 03:52:47.366]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:52:47.366 --> 03:52:56.111]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.111 --> 03:52:56.852]  In Game.
[03:52:56.852 --> 03:52:58.893]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:52:58.893 --> 03:52:59.974]  You have been warned.
[03:53:01.574 --> 03:53:04.836]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[03:53:04.836 --> 03:53:06.796]  You may have no choice.
[03:53:06.796 --> 03:53:09.997]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[03:53:09.997 --> 03:53:14.559]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[03:53:14.559 --> 03:53:22.161]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401Ks and IRAs.
[03:53:22.161 --> 03:53:26.823]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[03:53:27.363 --> 03:53:31.244]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.
[03:53:31.244 --> 03:53:35.345]  Put your retirement money beyond the reach of government financiers today by calling 1-866-323-5665.
[03:53:35.345 --> 03:53:42.848]  SafeGrow IRAs are just a phone call away.

[03:53:54.906 --> 03:53:55.907]  Call 1-866-323-5665.
[03:53:55.907 --> 03:54:23.545]  I'd love to just settle a beach and listen to music like this, relaxing, deep sea fishing, hanging out with my family, but no!
[03:54:25.635 --> 03:54:29.738]  No, I will burn the midnight oil and I will be told I'm doing a crappy job.
[03:54:29.738 --> 03:54:32.160]  Maybe so, but we're going to keep doing that job.
[03:54:32.160 --> 03:54:33.801]  We're the best at it there is.
[03:54:33.801 --> 03:54:36.503]  Doesn't say much, does it?
[03:54:36.503 --> 03:54:40.887]  I'm going to spend more time on this, I will tomorrow, but let's get into it now.
[03:54:40.887 --> 03:54:44.970]  This is Mr. Press with his radio show in D.C.
[03:54:44.970 --> 03:54:45.670]  with a U.S.
[03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:52.375]  Senator saying, oh yes, we want to hold talk radio accountable and we want to tell stations what they've got to air and what they've got to do.
[03:54:54.878 --> 03:55:05.524]  Here you go, the attack on the First Amendment, and this is all being spurred by the domestic act that they're trying to push, the Violent Radicalization Act, restricting internet, free speech, this show, and a lot more.
[03:55:05.524 --> 03:55:10.406]  Maybe they take me off the air, it'll be a vacation, I don't know.
[03:55:10.406 --> 03:55:11.907]  Alex, you've got to stop them from doing this.
[03:55:11.907 --> 03:55:13.048]  Okay, I'll try.
[03:55:13.048 --> 03:55:14.449]  What about you?
[03:55:14.449 --> 03:55:17.510]  Let's go ahead and go to some of this audio.
[03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:18.351]  You certainly have been
[03:55:19.356 --> 03:55:24.654]  One of, if not the most supportive voices in the United States Senate for progressive talk radio.
[03:55:25.365 --> 03:55:32.846]  So, I know you must be dismayed to learn that here in Washington, D.C., as we've been talking about this hour, Obama 1260 is going away.
[03:55:32.846 --> 03:55:38.487]  They're changing the format, they're dumping progressive talk, which as you know, Senator, they've done in market after market... Did you hear that?
[03:55:38.487 --> 03:55:40.288]  A radio station named after Obama?
[03:55:40.288 --> 03:55:45.088]  San Diego, Sacramento, Miami this last week... Because you suck, that's why!
[03:55:45.088 --> 03:55:46.329]  What can we do about that?
[03:55:46.329 --> 03:55:51.850]  And aren't owners of radio stations required to provide some balance of voices?
[03:55:51.850 --> 03:55:53.550]  You're a sniveling idiot.
[03:55:53.550 --> 03:55:53.910]  Absolutely.
[03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:54.230]  Absolutely.
[03:55:55.148 --> 03:56:03.390]  It's such a disservice to the public and I continue to think that we need to be seeing a couple things happen.
[03:56:03.390 --> 03:56:16.533]  Just continuing to support great radio hosts like yourself and promoting more programs that are coming into the marketplace.
[03:56:16.533 --> 03:56:19.473]  But we're going to have to have some accountability.
[03:56:19.473 --> 03:56:22.374]  You know, we had something called the Fairness Doctrine.
[03:56:23.453 --> 03:56:29.197]  Back until the 80s when it was removed where you had to have balance.
[03:56:29.197 --> 03:56:40.783]  And I think something that requires that in a market with owners that have multiple stations, that they have got to have balance.
[03:56:40.783 --> 03:56:49.468]  There has to be some community interest balance standard that says both sides have to be heard.
[03:56:49.468 --> 03:56:50.909]  And I think that
[03:56:51.789 --> 03:57:03.255]  You know, I see this myself as a member of the Senate, when you see... Okay, and it goes on and on how they want to do this, and they're talking about introducing bills, or having the FCC through Fiat do it, just order it.
[03:57:03.255 --> 03:57:06.757]  They did this before, until the late 80s, you couldn't have any political opinion.
[03:57:06.757 --> 03:57:08.998]  It was just all repeat government propaganda.
[03:57:08.998 --> 03:57:12.259]  And then it became neocon fake information, but so what?
[03:57:12.259 --> 03:57:15.661]  You can't stop free speech, and you can't shut it down.
[03:57:15.661 --> 03:57:19.043]  And they want to make people put Bill Press on.
[03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:23.832]  With that buzzing audio.
[03:57:23.832 --> 03:57:29.538]  I mean, they want to make you listen to this, and they keep talking about both sides, as if it's Republican and Democrat.
[03:57:29.538 --> 03:57:34.183]  No, it's Republican and Democrat together here, and then we the people are right here.
[03:57:34.183 --> 03:57:39.368]  And this whole attack, the FCC's talking about regulating the Internet, and websites and news sites.
[03:57:40.558 --> 03:57:45.621]  And the government's talked about making all sites be handicap accessible.
[03:57:45.621 --> 03:57:47.902]  Little sites and people can't pay for that and can't do it.
[03:57:47.902 --> 03:57:49.763]  That'll bring it down to a handful.
[03:57:49.763 --> 03:57:58.508]  They are trying to shut down free speech on the internet too and taxing and regulating and no more peer-to-peer or no more net neutrality.
[03:57:58.508 --> 03:57:59.729]  They're attacking free speech.
[03:57:59.729 --> 03:58:04.872]  So in the time we've got, let's continue to fight for free speech and expand our platform as much as possible.
[03:58:05.839 --> 03:58:08.001]  We had Bob Chapman on.
[03:58:08.001 --> 03:58:09.183]  We had Steve Watson on.
[03:58:09.183 --> 03:58:16.751]  I covered a lot of key news in the first hour dealing with the eight states saying, we know your New World Order.
[03:58:16.751 --> 03:58:18.012]  We know you're building FEMA camps.
[03:58:18.012 --> 03:58:19.674]  This is in bills.
[03:58:19.674 --> 03:58:21.076]  And we're not going along with this.
[03:58:21.076 --> 03:58:26.762]  So that is very exciting and a story that Kurt Nemo wrote that links to all the mainstream documents and information on that.
[03:58:27.142 --> 03:58:31.266]  So we'll be back tomorrow, well back Sunday actually, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:31.266 --> 03:58:35.310]  on the radio, but the retransmission starts now at Infowars.com on the streams.
[03:58:35.310 --> 03:58:41.656]  We'll be back in 70 seconds, so stay with us.
[03:58:41.656 --> 03:58:47.682]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.667 --> 03:58:53.348]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.348 --> 03:58:58.089]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.089 --> 03:59:01.050]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.050 --> 03:59:04.091]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.091 --> 03:59:08.813]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:08.953 --> 03:59:10.415]  I knew you would want one!
