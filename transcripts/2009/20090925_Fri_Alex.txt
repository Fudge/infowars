[00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.431]  It is Friday, the 25th day of September 2009.
[00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:14.792]  We're going to be live here with a completely jam-packed broadcast for the next four hours.
[00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:48.277]  Coming up, we're going to get updates in the second and fourth hour from our crew in the ground, on the ground, for the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:49.418]  Then we've got
[00:00:50.697 --> 00:01:02.723]  Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster joining us as well to talk about all the different economic developments that have taken place.
[00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:06.805]  Rob Dew, who I sent out of town last minute
[00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:13.910]  Tuesday night was the producer that set up Dave Mustaine and he'll probably be on today.
[00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:22.176]  They said they were he was excited to come on but we may have had some scheduling snafus so he may be in the third hour or fourth hour or on with us next week.
[00:01:22.196 --> 00:01:33.425]  There's also some Turing issues going on, but Dave Mustaine with his new album with Megadeth called Endgame about global government and mass eugenics extermination will be on the show very soon.
[00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:38.029]  We also of course had Congressman Ron Paul for an amazing interview yesterday and Congressman Grayson.
[00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:43.794]  We've got more congressmen coming up next week, probably Grayson again.
[00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:46.516]  Just incredibly important radio show.
[00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:49.378]  Every day it gets more intense.
[00:01:49.378 --> 00:01:50.880]  Here is what we have on our plate.
[00:01:51.994 --> 00:02:02.840]  Barack Obama and the mainstream corporate media and Israel and England are all beating the drum that Iran now has secret nuclear facilities and weapons.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.062]  Same lie they used seven years ago on Iraq.
[00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:12.805]  They are now pushing it big time even though the CIA's own report says that they were left alone to do whatever they wanted.
[00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:16.187]  It would still be another seven years till they got a primitive A-bomb.
[00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:17.953]  Of course, the U.S.
[00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:22.357]  helped give Pakistan nukes, but nobody's worried about that.
[00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:25.380]  This is just a pretext to attack Iran over their oil supply.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:37.411]  And notice that right as they're beating the drums, and right as Israel's saying they're getting ready to strike Iran, as early as the winter 2009 into the end of winter 2010, any time in the next four to five months,
[00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:49.418]  Notice that suddenly they have bomb plots they foiled in Dallas, Texas and also in Illinois.
[00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:53.041]  And then it turned out they've charged some people in New York with lying to federal officials.
[00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.163]  They can't even charge them with terrorism.
[00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:59.147]  It's come out over and over again that they framed people, set people up.
[00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:07.053]  The modus operandi with the 93 World Trade Center bombing is the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers.
[00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.955]  The group was led by a federal informant.
[00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:15.653]  Uh, who then thought that they were setting him up, that it wasn't a sting, that they were really going to bomb the building.
[00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:21.639]  He recorded the FBI and gave a press conference on the courthouse steps, releasing the tapes to the media.
[00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:27.625]  It's in the New York Times that the FBI cooked a bomb, trained the drivers, uh, threw Ahmaud Salaam, and he blew the whistle on them.
[00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:37.646]  And remember in 2006 in the Florida, Miami reported bombings with Muslim black extremists.
[00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:39.888]  Turned out they weren't Muslims, they were Christians.
[00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:42.009]  They were street kids, potheads.
[00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:53.434]  The FBI gave them hundreds of thousands of dollars, rented out a warehouse, told them they'll give them more money and more marijuana if they dress up in camouflage and make videos and shoot video of the federal building.
[00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:55.195]  So they were led by a, you know,
[00:03:56.095 --> 00:03:59.618]  Black FBI informant posing as a Rastafarian.
[00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:09.086]  And it's just the same thing with two years ago with the Muslim kids in Toronto and the Royal Mounted Police delivering ammonium nitrate to their door, fertilizer.
[00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.627]  This is the exact same thing.
[00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:15.531]  And notice the Feds like to do this in clusters, like, oh my gosh, look, there's bomb plots everywhere.
[00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.232]  Oh my gosh, Iran may be behind it.
[00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:19.374]  Oh my gosh, Iran's with Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:19.374 --> 00:04:25.299]  Iran is Shiite, the opposite group of the Sunni-based, Wahhabist-based Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:31.769]  And actually Al Qaeda, mainstream news, works for the CIA and is trying to destabilize and attack Iran.
[00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:41.693]  Also, hundreds, go to Google, type in New World Order, hundreds of news articles saying a world government, the end of the dollar is being formed at the G20 right now.
[00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:49.941]  And the even bigger, more important news, military police kidnap G20 protester, shove him into unmarked car and snatch and grab.
[00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:53.704]  Preliminary viewing the video, it looks staged to me.
[00:04:53.704 --> 00:04:56.187]  We'll tell you what's behind that and a lot more.
[00:04:56.187 --> 00:04:57.388]  Huge broadcast today.
[00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:07.798]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:13.886]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:05:13.886 --> 00:05:16.549]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:23.117]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:27.181]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:32.568]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:34.870]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.632]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:39.155]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:43.880]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.604]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:50.727]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:50.727 --> 00:05:52.629]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.731]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.746 --> 00:06:06.470]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.811]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:09.793]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.793 --> 00:06:16.818]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:25.344]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:32.833]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:35.994]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:39.876]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was BOOM!
[00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:40.196]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:40.516]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:40.836]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:41.756]  BOOM!
[00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:44.837]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:50.879]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.900]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.166]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:02.948]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:04.189]  I've been so sick.
[00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:05.870]  Will a life-change tea help me?
[00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.732]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:07:07.732 --> 00:07:13.857]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:07:13.857 --> 00:07:19.342]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:24.245]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.646]  We use results.
[00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:30.409]  LifeChangeT's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.033]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:38.895]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:42.798]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:07:42.798 --> 00:07:43.398]  Our number is 928-308-0408.
[00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:50.740]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.

[00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:01.545]  Big Brother
[00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:08.272]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.272 --> 00:08:10.032]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:11.612]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.612 --> 00:08:13.173]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:17.374]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.374 --> 00:08:21.415]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:31.150]  World Government is openly being announced and formed in front of our very eyes.
[00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.972]  Barack Obama has engaged in high treason and become the first U.S.
[00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.353]  President to chair the U.N.
[00:08:36.353 --> 00:08:37.894]  Security Council.
[00:08:37.894 --> 00:08:38.254]  The U.N.
[00:08:38.254 --> 00:08:42.497]  Security Council is the most powerful body, the only body with real power in the U.N.
[00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:50.662]  The Secretary General chairs the General Assembly of all the different third world countries that have no power.
[00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:51.082]  Only the G20
[00:08:54.113 --> 00:09:07.908]  Finance ministers have the real power in the governmental systems of the nation-states, but the Security Council and its rotating 15-member board is the true power in the United Nations.
[00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:14.907]  And President Obama has violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:09:14.907 --> 00:09:19.491]  Constitution, taking his seat on the rotating board.
[00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:26.757]  Every 15 months, he is now saying he will chair it for the month-long duration of the month-long term.
[00:09:26.757 --> 00:09:28.559]  And he has to swear an oath to the U.N.
[00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:36.286]  Charter to do that, that is in complete contravention to our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and his oath of office.
[00:09:36.286 --> 00:09:37.387]  We're going to be discussing that
[00:09:38.852 --> 00:09:52.073]  I have a huge stack of news here today where they are openly announcing world government, the New World Order.
[00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:55.751]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:09:55.751 --> 00:09:58.374]  We have Israel saying they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[00:09:58.374 --> 00:10:03.019]  We see media hype and propaganda about how they have hidden nukes and hidden facilities.
[00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.884]  We're seeing a complete replay of 2002 into 2003 with a strike six and a half years ago on Iraq.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.202]  We have military police kidnapping G20 protesters.
[00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:18.425]  Not just one, but one on video, but other confirmed reports.
[00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:24.109]  Anyone that even spoke out against it or videotaped it was then arrested by riot police and drug away.
[00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:29.853]  This is right out of Maoist China or Soviet Russia.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:39.822]  And then we have the Newspaper Revitalization Act with Barack Obama saying he wants it to pass to federalize the major newspapers.
[00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:42.322]  Openly a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:10:42.322 --> 00:10:46.943]  They're taking over the churches and the faith-based initiatives and the clergy response teams are taking over the newspapers.
[00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:48.183]  They're taking over the auto industry.
[00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:50.544]  They're taking over the banking industry.
[00:10:50.544 --> 00:10:55.385]  They want to take over health care, 20% of what's left of the economy.
[00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:58.785]  You think the insurance companies and hospitals do a sorry job sometimes.
[00:10:58.785 --> 00:11:01.286]  They're angels compared to the government.
[00:11:02.146 --> 00:11:09.288]  That's why the insurance companies are actually lobbying in many cases for this government takeover because then they're going to have liability protection.
[00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:16.589]  So that is all coming up today as well.
[00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:25.892]  I also want to get into the fact
[00:11:27.617 --> 00:11:38.224]  That these bomb plots in Dallas and in Illinois are classically staged to hype all this Iran fear.
[00:11:38.224 --> 00:11:45.549]  We are also going to get into this piece of propaganda.
[00:11:45.549 --> 00:11:48.571]  Spanking lowers a child's IQ, researchers say.
[00:11:50.001 --> 00:12:18.731]  and we have caught these different government researchers university researchers or member the five years ago a big illinois chicago uh... study came out saying that the founding fathers didn't like guns and only ten percent of the colonists own guns and then other researchers like john lot the professor when research and found it was all a lie and the professor was
[00:12:19.642 --> 00:12:21.723]  Disbarred?
[00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:41.153]  There needs to be an investigation of this study because I'll guarantee you that the higher IQ families lied when they were asked in the survey in the study if they spanked their children knowing that it's not illegal to spank your children it's just illegal to hurt them physically and that they would
[00:12:42.523 --> 00:12:44.205]  Have their children taken?
[00:12:44.205 --> 00:12:47.310]  And I've seen this in polling science studies.
[00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:59.366]  When the media calls up a household and asks a controversial question, they found that depending on the question, around half of people will lie and go with what they believe the politically correct answer is.
[00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:08.853]  And the margin of error in the study is more than five percent, and so the whole thing is a fraud, but it's in the Los Angeles Times.
[00:13:08.853 --> 00:13:11.255]  Spanking lowers a child's IQ.
[00:13:11.255 --> 00:13:22.826]  Researchers say being spanked as a child is linked to having a lower IQ, according to a study presented today at the International Conference on Violence, Abuse, and Trauma in San Diego.
[00:13:22.826 --> 00:13:25.568]  That's a UN NGO-sponsored event.
[00:13:25.568 --> 00:13:26.989]  And again, the UN has openly stated
[00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.071]  Hundreds of times they want to end the family.
[00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:32.591]  They want no authority of the parents over the children.
[00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:39.193]  And even if you don't spank your children, they routinely take them for bruises on their knees, playing in the playground.
[00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:44.895]  I know parents here in Austin whose children at school fall off a jungle gym and break their finger or arm.
[00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:47.676]  CPS goes ahead and takes them.
[00:13:47.676 --> 00:13:50.637]  It just goes, children fall off the front porch, knock a tooth out.
[00:13:51.337 --> 00:13:52.919]  Something that happened to me.
[00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.100]  They try to take your children.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.604]  Your child is playing in a tree, falls out, dislocates their shoulder.
[00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:00.005]  They take them.
[00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.347]  They are hunting your children.
[00:14:01.347 --> 00:14:04.129]  They're doing everything they can to set the precedent to take them.
[00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:12.337]  As John P. Holdren, White House Science Czar's own government policy textbook states, states, openly,
[00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:18.312]  That they want to take basically all children globally and raise them in government dormitories.
[00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:21.980]  China is the model, the first country in the last 30 years to attempt this.
[00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:28.512]  Of course, they started with 2,000 families, now it's 20-plus thousand in England.
[00:14:28.512 --> 00:14:46.976]  At birth, or if you're on welfare or in the government system, involved in their Secure Start, they don't call it Head Start over there, that 20,000 homes and growing, they want to double it again by next year, it'll be 40,000, have cameras in every room in the house, in the kitchen, in the bedrooms, in the bathrooms.
[00:14:46.976 --> 00:14:52.057]  Government bureaucrats watch you 24-7, making you, quote, eat proper meals, go to sleep,
[00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.353]  on time and that you don't raise your voice to your children.
[00:14:56.353 --> 00:15:08.886]  Now of course the government can lock them up in little prison cells, the government can abuse them, can rape them five times more likely in US averages, even higher in England, for the government to abuse children than any other group, but they're all above the law.
[00:15:09.446 --> 00:15:11.448]  And held to a different lower standard.
[00:15:11.448 --> 00:15:16.815]  Parents are held to a bizarre standard of no yelling, no spanking, no nothing.
[00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:19.518]  And so the cameras will be going in your homes.
[00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:24.284]  Houston Police Chief two years ago called for cameras in everyone's homes in Houston.
[00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:28.348]  They are now taking warrantless checkpoints, taking blood at checkpoints.
[00:15:28.348 --> 00:15:29.410]  It just goes on.
[00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:40.355]  And on and on and on everywhere with the different things that they are doing.
[00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:41.975]  I sound a bit distracted here.
[00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:56.942]  I had a giant stack on my desk with about 15 articles or so that I printed up where the mainstream media is calling for world government.
[00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:12.801]  I also had a print up here of all of my YouTube clips that I was going to be playing.
[00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.924]  No, that's not it.
[00:16:14.924 --> 00:16:15.966]  That's the YouTube stack.
[00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:21.307]  Oh, it doesn't matter, we can go to Google and type in New World Order and they're all print up.
[00:16:21.307 --> 00:16:22.808]  I have two of them here.
[00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:28.811]  USA Today, Obama set stage for New World Order, Obama now President of the World.
[00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:29.771]  I've got all of that.
[00:16:31.647 --> 00:16:35.528]  The producers have begged me to clean the desk off every day, but I end up doing it about every week.
[00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:40.329]  There's literally probably a thousand or more articles sitting here on my stack.
[00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:42.409]  Sarkozy's called for a new world order.
[00:16:42.409 --> 00:16:55.172]  Basically every world leader we know of, Gordon Brown, Sarkozy, the Brazilian president, they've all called for a new world order and they've described what that new world order is.
[00:16:55.172 --> 00:16:59.573]  And they say it's a banking dictatorship.
[00:17:00.777 --> 00:17:01.477]  over the planet.
[00:17:01.477 --> 00:17:18.944]  The only person, the only world leader to slam it was the president of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, and he slammed global government and said we don't want global governance, that it will ruin our society.
[00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:22.886]  And I've got that in my stack from Wednesday.
[00:17:22.886 --> 00:17:23.166]  This is
[00:17:26.564 --> 00:17:27.745]  Very bizarre.
[00:17:27.745 --> 00:17:30.787]  But I will no doubt find it during the break.
[00:17:30.787 --> 00:17:33.308]  I had it when I started the show.
[00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:35.369]  But we're going to go over all of this today.
[00:17:35.369 --> 00:17:52.420]  One of the other huge, huge, huge, huge issues that we're going to be covering today is military police kidnap G20 protester, shove him into unmarked car.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.600]  And this is on video.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.321]  Now, we've got
[00:17:55.934 --> 00:18:03.183]  Scores, I mean scores of videos of police coming up to women doing nothing and Billy clubbing them in the head or tackling them.
[00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:05.325]  For some reason they love to attack women.
[00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:13.194]  We've got video of the sound cannons firing at people that is right out of a sci-fi nightmare, sci-fi dystopic movie.
[00:18:13.194 --> 00:18:15.317]  Black armored vehicles, police and military.
[00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:21.341]  Police in black uniforms broadcasting, this is an unlawful assembly, you must disperse.
[00:18:21.341 --> 00:18:26.143]  And then firing rubber bullets and bean bags at people and tear gas and sound cannons.
[00:18:26.143 --> 00:18:36.166]  And then military just pulling up in unmarked cars, jumping out in military uniforms and grabbing peaceful protesters and slamming them into cars and dragging them away.
[00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:39.468]  But I see the officers, the military men, smiling.
[00:18:40.512 --> 00:19:06.760]  And we saw this in Ottawa in 2008 at the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership Summit, and it did, and I said, that's fake, that is a provocateur, staging stuff for the media, and then the police stage arrest of them, and we'll probably end up getting contacted by the person, because so many people listen to the show, if they're not a Fed, but preliminarily, I will give you the preliminary judgment that this is staged.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.601]  Now why would they be staging the arrest
[00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:26.709]  Again, unmarked, champagne, Crown Vic pulls up, three military MPs pile out, they grab the guy, and it looks like the urban warfare drills I've been to where they hire actors to scream and yell and say, oh no, not the camp.
[00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:28.952]  Why would they be staging snatch and grabs?
[00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:32.853]  Now, it may be real.
[00:19:32.853 --> 00:19:33.653]  Either way, it's bad.
[00:19:33.653 --> 00:19:38.115]  They're either training everybody to accept snatch and grabs of the military, or it really happened.
[00:19:38.115 --> 00:19:41.817]  And the reports are pouring in that, no, the military is arresting people for no reason.
[00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:43.817]  But this looks staged.
[00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:54.222]  Now, I can't play the audio, so we'll have to go to it once we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, and I'll talk over it with play-by-play, because there's so much profanity as protesters are screaming and dropping F-bombs.
[00:19:54.222 --> 00:19:57.784]  But you can watch them uncensored at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:00.817 --> 00:20:04.338]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:20:04.338 --> 00:20:06.258]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:20:06.258 --> 00:20:11.820]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:19.842]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:20:29.424 --> 00:20:32.647]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[00:20:52.283 --> 00:20:53.584]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:07.425]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:15.551]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:23.717]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:28.461]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.801 --> 00:21:34.023]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.023 --> 00:21:38.365]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:39.445]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:43.947]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:43.947 --> 00:21:45.328]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:51.851]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:54.093]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.

[00:21:56.755 --> 00:22:03.880]  It's here.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.024]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:22:09.024 --> 00:22:16.669]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:17.355 --> 00:22:24.801]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:36.530]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.513]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:40.513 --> 00:22:42.775]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:46.598]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:54.523]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.650]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.510]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.792]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:23:06.792 --> 00:23:09.833]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:16.475]  Liquid Zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[00:23:16.475 --> 00:23:21.117]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[00:23:21.117 --> 00:23:29.360]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:38.122]  Liquid Zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[00:23:38.122 --> 00:23:41.423]  And Liquid Zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.
[00:23:41.423 --> 00:23:44.984]  Although your list of elements may be endless, the solution is simple.
[00:23:44.984 --> 00:23:49.565]  Try Liquid Zeolite for yourself by visiting RestoreYourHealthNow.com.
[00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:51.205]  That's RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:52.405]  That's 1-800-976-0025 today.
[00:24:14.343 --> 00:24:23.088]  Coming up in the next hour, Jason Burmiss, Jason Douglas, and Rob Dew will be reporting live from the G20.
[00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:25.830]  Unbelievable developments there.
[00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:32.674]  I'm going to break the snatch and grabs down, the LRAD weapons, the microwave guns, the tear gas, the rubber bullets, the beanbags.
[00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:40.838]  The media lying and saying that, oh, the protesters attacked police so they attacked them.
[00:24:40.838 --> 00:24:41.680]  No, they said no.
[00:24:42.924 --> 00:24:44.926]  Assembly anywhere in the city.
[00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:46.447]  No permits to protest.
[00:24:46.447 --> 00:24:49.790]  See, first they say, oh, you've stood out your right to protest, but you've got to get a permit.
[00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.293]  Then they say, oh, we're not issuing a permit under special rules.
[00:24:53.293 --> 00:24:59.218]  Then they start attacking people and a few dozen stage mask feds.
[00:24:59.218 --> 00:25:03.922]  Again, we caught them in Denver, caught them in Seattle, caught them in England, caught them in Canada.
[00:25:03.922 --> 00:25:04.943]  Mainstream news.
[00:25:04.943 --> 00:25:06.385]  I have seen the video.
[00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:08.607]  These are all big guys that are doing this.
[00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:11.668]  They are cops, are informants, period.
[00:25:11.668 --> 00:25:16.330]  And it always comes out a month or two later, but as minor footnotes in the newspapers.
[00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.631]  Not the big news, the big national news.
[00:25:19.631 --> 00:25:20.551]  So that is coming up.
[00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:23.052]  I found the stack here.
[00:25:23.052 --> 00:25:26.233]  I found the stack.
[00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.194]  As world government is openly being announced.
[00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:30.535]  Obama set stage for new world order.
[00:25:30.535 --> 00:25:32.435]  USA Today.
[00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:35.236]  Community organizing the world.
[00:25:35.236 --> 00:25:36.477]  Another headline out of the trumpet.
[00:25:37.366 --> 00:25:41.748]  Press TV, Brazil, after new world order and economy.
[00:25:41.748 --> 00:25:47.892]  The Star, out of Toronto, changing power structure shapes a new world order.
[00:25:47.892 --> 00:25:50.513]  Then I printed off the actual Google list page.
[00:25:50.513 --> 00:25:52.854]  New economic order takes shape at G20.
[00:25:52.854 --> 00:25:59.438]  Reuters, G20 to police new economic, new world economic order.
[00:26:00.663 --> 00:26:03.445]  New World Order after Pittsburgh.
[00:26:03.445 --> 00:26:05.127]  In fact, guys, just print me all of these.
[00:26:05.127 --> 00:26:06.348]  I didn't even print these.
[00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:13.053]  The first block of articles that come up, it says 4,644 news articles.
[00:26:13.053 --> 00:26:17.938]  Now, because Google, that's just in the first bunch of New World Order headlines.
[00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:23.542]  And there's 4,644 in Google News, articles with the title New World Order.
[00:26:23.542 --> 00:26:24.103]  Now, I'm sorry.
[00:26:25.342 --> 00:26:30.325]  I normally say, I see hundreds of New World Order articles a day or a week.
[00:26:30.325 --> 00:26:34.047]  That's me under-guesstimating, because there's no way to count all these.
[00:26:34.047 --> 00:26:36.488]  People then send me emails going, they're not hundreds!
[00:26:36.488 --> 00:26:37.469]  You're right, I'm wrong.
[00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:38.670]  Let me correct myself.
[00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.271]  I really apologize.
[00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:42.872]  It's not hundreds, as I said at the start of the show.
[00:26:42.872 --> 00:26:47.035]  It's 4,644 in one news block.
[00:26:47.035 --> 00:26:49.676]  In a separate news block of the term New World Order, there's 394 in the second block.
[00:26:51.724 --> 00:26:53.766]  And then you go down to the next block, there's 109.
[00:26:53.766 --> 00:26:58.870]  And you go down to the next block for New World Order, there's 3,887.
[00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.873]  These are all different articles, so I'm sorry.
[00:27:02.873 --> 00:27:06.296]  There's, uh, looks like more than 8,000 here.
[00:27:06.296 --> 00:27:08.658]  I apologize, it's not hundreds.
[00:27:08.658 --> 00:27:11.760]  It's 8,000 plus.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.586]  I mean, every newspaper I went and looked at today said New World Order, most of them on the front page.
[00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:19.687]  And I am laughed at.
[00:27:20.751 --> 00:27:21.863]  I am made fun of!
[00:27:25.071 --> 00:27:30.393]  It is all a big joke to the yuppies that there's no new world order.
[00:27:30.393 --> 00:27:33.513]  Ted Turner doesn't want to have a world government to curb population.
[00:27:33.513 --> 00:27:35.954]  They're not having secret population reduction meetings.
[00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:39.295]  Thousands of government documents don't say they're poisoning the water in vaccines.
[00:27:39.295 --> 00:27:43.536]  Of course, they really do say that, but it doesn't matter to the cops and military.
[00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:47.157]  It's too much fun to go out there and walk up to a woman.
[00:27:47.157 --> 00:27:51.919]  They went out to the Pittsburgh University, we've got video of this, and there's just students there
[00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:57.603]  Uh, coming out of their dorms and coming out of events, and they just start beating the daylights out of them.
[00:27:57.603 --> 00:27:59.545]  People are like, why are you here?
[00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:01.346]  And they say, no assemblies allowed.
[00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.368]  They're like, this is the university.
[00:28:03.368 --> 00:28:06.550]  And the cop just hits her with a billy club.
[00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.192]  I mean, that's what America is.
[00:28:08.192 --> 00:28:18.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have videos up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com where... And there's hundreds of these YouTube videos.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.940]  Probably thousands.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.901]  I haven't counted them up.
[00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:20.982]  It's in the hundreds.
[00:28:20.982 --> 00:28:22.243]  I mean, I can't even watch them all.
[00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:33.416]  And you'll just see an empty street in the middle of a neighborhood and here comes a giant armored vehicle announcing no one is allowed on the streets, no congregations, no one.
[00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:36.638]  If you're on the street, no matter what your business, flee now!
[00:28:36.638 --> 00:28:38.779]  They go and they turn on the sound cannon.
[00:28:40.077 --> 00:28:41.698]  And then the person ducks back into the business.
[00:28:41.698 --> 00:28:43.120]  There's no one on the streets.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:50.986]  We've got photos and videos of little kids in their front yards covering their ears as the sound cannon rolls by.
[00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:55.029]  Just little kids in Pittsburgh at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:28:55.029 --> 00:29:01.315]  4 o'clock in the afternoon after school on a Thursday.
[00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:09.254]  Our guys are out there right now getting more footage of this and just little kids are out playing baseball or playing with a soccer ball.
[00:29:09.254 --> 00:29:14.497]  I mean I'm talking, I got one photo where it looks like it's a nine-year-old kid and he's sitting there with horror.
[00:29:16.277 --> 00:29:17.418]  I found that last night with Aaron.
[00:29:17.418 --> 00:29:19.359]  He's not here yet because we're up until 2 in the morning.
[00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:21.640]  But as soon as he gets in, it's in Aaron's email.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:27.824]  And it just shows the little kid, just in his front yard, looking with fear at the police driving by with a sound cannon, hitting him hard.
[00:29:27.824 --> 00:29:30.965]  Because the cops have been trained zero tolerance.
[00:29:30.965 --> 00:29:37.769]  The city code under Pennsylvania Patriot Act, that's what they call it there, says that you're not allowed to be outside your house.
[00:29:37.769 --> 00:29:39.150]  This is martial law.
[00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.351]  Hit that 9 year old!
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.102]  And so they shatter his ear canal.
[00:29:44.102 --> 00:29:45.303]  He'll have permanent damage.
[00:29:45.303 --> 00:29:47.404]  But hey, all in a day's work.
[00:29:47.404 --> 00:29:49.326]  Well don't worry cops, they're gonna take your pension fund.
[00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:50.907]  Your bosses are.
[00:29:50.907 --> 00:29:52.308]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.308 --> 00:29:54.850]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:03.802]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:09.127]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.127 --> 00:30:11.169]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:16.174]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.174 --> 00:30:17.095]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.355 --> 00:30:18.476]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.476 --> 00:30:20.358]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.358 --> 00:30:21.438]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.438 --> 00:30:23.640]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.961]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.961 --> 00:30:26.503]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.503 --> 00:30:31.767]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:35.350]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.833]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:40.393]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.393 --> 00:30:41.294]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.294 --> 00:30:42.394]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.394 --> 00:30:43.334]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.334 --> 00:30:44.414]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.414 --> 00:30:47.475]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.475 --> 00:30:49.236]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.236 --> 00:30:50.156]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.129 --> 00:31:06.955]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.955 --> 00:31:14.543]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.543 --> 00:31:20.710]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.090]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.591]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:37.154]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.154 --> 00:31:38.834]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:40.695]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:46.916]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:55.876]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.876 --> 00:31:57.459]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.459 --> 00:31:58.641]  The people strike back!
[00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:05.686]  Food security from eFoods Direct, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[00:32:05.686 --> 00:32:07.186]  It's a scary world we live in.
[00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:11.547]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[00:32:11.547 --> 00:32:15.248]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[00:32:15.248 --> 00:32:23.029]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:27.010]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.271]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoods
[00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:32.211]  We're good to go!
[00:33:04.076 --> 00:33:11.860]  They came and took it all away.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:19.664]  I'm looking at Google News at 8,000, roughly.
[00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:24.006]  It's more than that, but just on the first page.
[00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:29.649]  8,000 articles with the title, New World Order, in quotes.
[00:33:29.649 --> 00:33:30.289]  8,000.
[00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:32.771]  Headlines like, New World Order is born.
[00:33:34.138 --> 00:33:39.964]  President Obama, Obama president of the world.
[00:33:39.964 --> 00:33:42.987]  World government is here.
[00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:45.089]  World government has arrived.
[00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:49.893]  G20 to police new economic order.
[00:33:49.893 --> 00:33:52.476]  That's the London Telegraph.
[00:33:52.476 --> 00:33:55.799]  Reuters, new world economic order takes shape at G20.
[00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:58.742]  Emergence of G20 signals new world order.
[00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:03.793]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:34:03.793 --> 00:34:13.276]  Maybe I should just sit here for the next four hours or the three and a half hours we got left, roughly, and just read a thousand headlines for you.
[00:34:13.276 --> 00:34:14.676]  I mean, there is a world government.
[00:34:14.676 --> 00:34:15.877]  It is run by private banks.
[00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:34.060]  We have let a group of private banking families control the Treasury Departments of almost every major nation on earth and the G20, and they have issued themselves tens of trillions of dollars a year in fiat currency and credit to buy everything up!
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:42.202]  The resources, the media companies, the militaries, the governments, and everyone just bows down to con artists!
[00:34:42.202 --> 00:34:43.722]  John D. Rockefeller, the big
[00:34:46.465 --> 00:34:51.409]  Patriarch of the Rockefeller family, 150 something years ago when he got going.
[00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.713]  His father, talk about a devilish looking guy with this big beard.
[00:34:55.713 --> 00:34:59.436]  You can pull up the Rockefeller family history online, look at him.
[00:34:59.436 --> 00:35:04.381]  He was a snake oil salesman that made a whole bunch of money selling opium as a cure-all in bottles.
[00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:12.174]  And then he was the first snake oil salesman to not just send out a wagon himself and go town to town.
[00:35:12.174 --> 00:35:14.336]  He thought, I'll franchise this.
[00:35:14.336 --> 00:35:18.920]  I'll have warehouses all over the East and the West as the railroads expanded.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.384]  And he thought of branding and banners and the name of his company.
[00:35:24.384 --> 00:35:31.330]  And he sent out thousands of wagons on the trains to go to even the smallest towns selling snake oil.
[00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.133]  And they made tens of millions of dollars
[00:35:35.117 --> 00:35:35.297]  Yeah.
[00:35:52.170 --> 00:36:01.295]  Set up gold mines and they would walk in, blow the sheriff's head off, kill the mayor, burn the town down and bring in different mercenary forces.
[00:36:01.295 --> 00:36:04.116]  Now that's who set up the New World Order.
[00:36:04.116 --> 00:36:06.017]  They sent out wagons with opium.
[00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:26.810]  And they got everybody addicted to drugs, and they got filthy rich off that, and then they went out and took the gold mines, and took the coal mines, and they went out at gunpoint and took the silver mines, and they went out and took over the oil fields, and they rule this planet with the Queen of England and the Rothschilds, period.
[00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:33.355]  Because John D's daddy, I forget his name, do me a favor, pull up John D. Rockefeller, the first
[00:36:35.137 --> 00:36:38.940]  Father, it'll pull up, I forget his name.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.002]  John D. Rockefeller's father, I forget his name.
[00:36:41.002 --> 00:36:45.005]  We go live at PrisonPlanet.tv next hour, we'll have that and have his name for it.
[00:36:45.005 --> 00:36:46.266]  The name escapes me at the time.
[00:36:46.266 --> 00:36:47.127]  But that's the history of it.
[00:36:47.127 --> 00:36:49.068]  I've studied it, read several books on it.
[00:36:49.068 --> 00:36:51.970]  And it's on the Rockefeller's own family website.
[00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:56.794]  I've got a PBS documentary about the Rockefellers made 15 years ago or so.
[00:36:56.794 --> 00:36:59.136]  I guess early 90s more than that now.
[00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:00.998]  And they just brag about the whole thing.
[00:37:00.998 --> 00:37:02.439]  And all the famous cases.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.911]  You ever seen that Clint Eastwood movie?
[00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:11.095]  It's not High Plains Drifter, but it's a similar one.
[00:37:12.133 --> 00:37:22.738]  It's the one where he goes into a little town and the local gold mining company brings in the regulators and start killing all the gold miners who won't hand over their land.
[00:37:22.738 --> 00:37:25.319]  That is based on a whole bunch of true stories.
[00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:34.103]  They did that in Oklahoma, in Colorado, they did that in Texas, they did that in California, and they just walk right up to little kids and put a gun right to their head.
[00:37:34.103 --> 00:37:35.464]  In a famous case in Colorado,
[00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:37.505]  That happened in the last century.
[00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:45.847]  They came into a gold mining town, rode down the families, burned it down, shot little kids in the back, killed hundreds.
[00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:48.028]  There's just too many cases of this.
[00:37:48.028 --> 00:37:50.089]  And that's all they are!
[00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:59.132]  They're snake oil salesmen that took that money and learned how to create monopolies, and learned how to hire mercenaries.
[00:37:59.132 --> 00:38:03.114]  And what are they doing today with the mercenaries, with Blackwater, and all the rest of these companies?
[00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.174]  What are they doing to our nation?
[00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.831]  What have they turned us into?
[00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:08.553]  They own the private prisons.
[00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:10.614]  They own the banks that launder the drug money.
[00:38:10.614 --> 00:38:13.957]  They control the conduits that ship the drugs in.
[00:38:13.957 --> 00:38:17.360]  They own it and run it and dominate it all.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:26.107]  And if you look at David Rockefeller, he has funded hundreds of groups calling for world government.
[00:38:26.107 --> 00:38:27.629]  He makes George Soros look like a
[00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:35.225]  Small-time amateur at running groups, and Soros funds hundreds of groups on record.
[00:38:35.225 --> 00:38:39.629]  Billions and billions a year.
[00:38:39.629 --> 00:38:42.291]  And this is how they dominate our planet.
[00:38:42.291 --> 00:38:44.212]  This is how they operate.
[00:38:44.212 --> 00:38:46.634]  This is how they get their job done.
[00:38:46.634 --> 00:38:53.180]  And now they've come into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and they're openly announcing that in the next two years they're going to go ahead and scrap the dollar.
[00:38:54.127 --> 00:38:57.989]  And when we lose the dollar as the world reserve currency, that's all we've got left.
[00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:00.130]  That's our export is dollars.
[00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:17.320]  We don't really make anything, we don't really do anything except military and propaganda, and now we're going to lose the dollar, and on it they're going to have a new global system that regulates all the sub-currencies and sets the interest rates and the currency rates, and they're openly announcing in the news in thousands of articles.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.461]  Thousands of articles today!
[00:39:21.294 --> 00:39:33.324]  Not hundreds, thousands today, and thousands yesterday, and thousands the day before, and thousands of articles the day before that, they say, we're setting up a new old order, and what is that?
[00:39:36.075 --> 00:39:36.735]  And they brag.
[00:39:36.735 --> 00:39:38.115]  Obama says at the U.N.
[00:39:38.115 --> 00:39:41.656]  that a unipolar world is over, that the American empire is over.
[00:39:41.656 --> 00:39:42.056]  That's right.
[00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:45.697]  We have served our purpose to empower the world government empire.
[00:39:45.697 --> 00:39:47.417]  Now we recede into history.
[00:39:47.417 --> 00:39:48.078]  We are looted.
[00:39:48.078 --> 00:39:54.279]  We become a third world police state that just supplies military hardware and troops.
[00:39:54.279 --> 00:39:58.820]  And Europe and China become the center of the new world order along with Russia.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:03.301]  And the global taxation system with the carbon tax is now being erected and set up.
[00:40:05.885 --> 00:40:08.166]  And they explain that that is what it means.
[00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:13.669]  The group of 20 rich and developing countries is to take on a new role as caretaker of the global economy.
[00:40:13.669 --> 00:40:22.013]  Oh, they'll be the caretaker, the London Telegraph says, giving rising stars such as China and India more say in world affairs.
[00:40:22.013 --> 00:40:23.953]  And Obama now chairs.
[00:40:23.953 --> 00:40:29.376]  You see, the 15-member rotating Security Council has always had the U.S.
[00:40:29.376 --> 00:40:30.617]  ambassador to the U.N.
[00:40:30.617 --> 00:40:33.338]  chairing it when it falls to the United States every 15 months.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:44.868]  Because Article 1, Section 9 states the President can't serve a foreign government or corporation or swear an oath to any other group or take a title of nobility.
[00:40:44.868 --> 00:40:47.631]  Can't take a job as the Chairman of the East India Company.
[00:40:47.631 --> 00:40:51.534]  Can't take a job, can't become knighted by the throne in all of its duties.
[00:40:51.534 --> 00:40:53.196]  Can't be part of another government.
[00:40:53.196 --> 00:40:56.359]  Can't be a minister in the Austrian or the Chinese government.
[00:40:56.359 --> 00:40:59.341]  And you certainly can't be a minister in the G20.
[00:41:02.577 --> 00:41:18.895]  You certainly, and again that's the governmental chairs of the banking system of the nation states, and you certainly can't as a president be seated as the chairman of the UN Security Council and it's 15 members.
[00:41:18.895 --> 00:41:22.940]  But President Obama did it and he's now being called the President of the World.
[00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:30.432]  That's what they're doing.
[00:41:30.432 --> 00:41:31.872]  And he's setting the precedent.
[00:41:31.872 --> 00:41:39.675]  And that's why, and later we're going to play the video of this when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, but play the audio for radio listeners.
[00:41:39.675 --> 00:41:57.282]  That's why whenever Obama two days ago gaveled in the UN Security Council, Henry Kissinger that was there, and Obama thanked him with his mouth hanging open, Susan Rice, US Ambassador to the UN, was in ecstasy behind him, Rahm Emanuel was in ecstasy.
[00:41:57.282 --> 00:41:57.883]  Some of them
[00:41:58.908 --> 00:42:03.590]  General James L. Jones, the head of the National Security Council, the North Com Dictatorship.
[00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.231]  Rice was shaking.
[00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:09.432]  Rice was in ecstasy.
[00:42:09.432 --> 00:42:18.715]  In fact, they admitted on CNN and Fox that everyone was twittering in the chamber and freaking out over him, quote, becoming President of the World.
[00:42:18.715 --> 00:42:20.456]  And that a new world order had been born.
[00:42:20.456 --> 00:42:25.478]  And Obama didn't look too excited when he was sworn in or gave a speech to be U.S.
[00:42:25.478 --> 00:42:25.838]  President.
[00:42:27.523 --> 00:42:29.664]  January 21st of 2009.
[00:42:29.664 --> 00:42:33.407]  But when Obama gaveled, his voice was shaking.
[00:42:33.407 --> 00:42:40.611]  He radiated a Hitlerian-type energy, that dictator energy I've seen out of Mao, Stalin, and Hitler.
[00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:45.194]  And he truly blazed with a demoniac glow.
[00:42:45.194 --> 00:42:47.095]  Go watch it for yourself.
[00:42:47.095 --> 00:42:55.300]  I mean, this was, at every instinctive and political and intellectual level in my soul and heart and mind and intellect, this really shook me in the last two days to watch this.
[00:42:57.352 --> 00:43:13.619]  He is the prototype of things to come, but they're openly announcing world taxes, world regulation, shutting down our economy, kids tattling on their parents as climate cops, riding their parents' tickets from the public school, the public schools becoming the spy bases that take over the communities.
[00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:17.981]  It is all happening.
[00:43:17.981 --> 00:43:21.923]  What you're seeing is the complete destruction and fall of the Republic.
[00:43:22.765 --> 00:43:25.426]  Now, we can use this against them, though, like judo.
[00:43:25.426 --> 00:43:31.908]  They're openly announcing world government, openly announcing world taxation, openly announcing no free speech in major U.S.
[00:43:31.908 --> 00:43:41.691]  cities when any big event happens, sound canning nine-year-old children in their front yards and neighborhoods, driving down empty streets, announcing no one's allowed to be on the streets.
[00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:44.432]  That is classical martial law.
[00:43:44.432 --> 00:43:46.692]  Invoking the Patriot Act of Pennsylvania.
[00:43:46.692 --> 00:43:47.793]  That's the code they're invoking.
[00:43:47.793 --> 00:43:51.654]  Pennsylvania was chosen for this meeting because it has the most draconian state laws.
[00:43:52.875 --> 00:44:12.287]  Remember back in 2003 they passed the Pennsylvania Patriot Act, that has the sneak and peeks, the secret arrests, the snatch and grabs, and the military is now snatching and grabbing, just pulling up, and randomly it appears grabbing peaceful protesters off the streets, but the police and the military are laughing, and it looks completely staged.
[00:44:12.287 --> 00:44:19.612]  But just setting that precedent of snatch and grabs, where they pull up in a van or a car, grab you by your shoulders, and drag you screaming into the vehicle.
[00:44:21.511 --> 00:44:24.232]  It is unspeakably evil.
[00:44:24.232 --> 00:44:34.976]  And they're setting these beta test precedents, just like they did in 99 with Seattle, saying no free speech allowed in the city after they had 50 hired anarchists stage attacks on police and that was all declassified.
[00:44:34.976 --> 00:44:37.737]  Run by the Delta Force, the FBI, and the Secret Service.
[00:44:37.737 --> 00:44:43.179]  The G20 admits and Pittsburgh admits that the Secret Service and Army are running this operation.
[00:44:43.179 --> 00:44:44.120]  Look at my reporters.
[00:44:45.185 --> 00:44:56.034]  DefenseLink puts out a press release, says that media can come talk to them, where they're massing at the National Guard Armory, they pull up the front gate, say, hi, we're from InfoWars, we're from Chan... and they said, well, what's that on TV?
[00:44:56.034 --> 00:44:59.116]  Well, we're on Channel 10 in Austin and the radio.
[00:44:59.116 --> 00:44:59.797]  And they told him that.
[00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:04.027]  They laughed at him, came back, said, we want to talk to your boss.
[00:45:04.027 --> 00:45:04.948]  Then they got me on the phone.
[00:45:04.948 --> 00:45:07.149]  Then they laughed at us and said, get out of here.
[00:45:07.149 --> 00:45:08.570]  Maybe come back tomorrow.
[00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.492]  Then they call the police and say, people are at our perimeter sneaking around.
[00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:12.673]  They ran from us.
[00:45:12.673 --> 00:45:14.054]  We got their plate number.
[00:45:14.054 --> 00:45:24.742]  The police call us up on the cell phone they got from the rent car company posing as an Alamo rental car person and say, we know you're a terrorist and you're never going to get off the terrorist watch list in your life.
[00:45:25.652 --> 00:45:26.692]  Laughing about it.
[00:45:26.692 --> 00:45:29.313]  This is the new secret police America.
[00:45:29.313 --> 00:45:35.314]  Nine-year-olds being hit with sound cannons by police in black uniforms in the army.
[00:45:35.314 --> 00:45:40.835]  Here's CNN crowing, but at the same time whitewashing, like, oh, for a day.
[00:45:40.835 --> 00:45:44.136]  No, he's not head of the United Nations for a day.
[00:45:44.136 --> 00:45:49.577]  And if you study the UN power structure, the Secretary General is the head of the General Assembly.
[00:45:49.577 --> 00:45:54.178]  But of the 180-plus nations in it, only 15 have voting power.
[00:45:54.178 --> 00:45:55.238]  The real government
[00:45:56.656 --> 00:46:01.362]  It's not the shadow government, but you don't really hear about it in the media much.
[00:46:01.362 --> 00:46:08.310]  But you notice one veto of one Security Council member can override the entire General Assembly.
[00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.251]  It's the real power.
[00:46:09.251 --> 00:46:11.954]  And Barack Obama is now the President of the UN.
[00:46:11.954 --> 00:46:14.677]  He's now the Chairman of the UN Security Council.
[00:46:14.677 --> 00:46:16.620]  Here is CNN celebrating.
[00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:24.673]  Barack Obama caused some usually dull diplomats to come to life in the historic United Nations Security Council.
[00:46:24.673 --> 00:46:25.534]  Obama's U.N.
[00:46:25.534 --> 00:46:29.936]  debut created a stir even in a room packed with heads of state and government.
[00:46:32.842 --> 00:46:37.604]  And for a couple of hours, you could say Mr. Obama was President of the World.
[00:46:37.604 --> 00:46:51.852]  Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and UN Ambassador Susan Rice, Mr. Obama used the United States' one-month council presidency to drive approval of a resolution aimed at putting more teeth into curbing the spread of nuclear weapons.
[00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:55.894]  Prior to now, there have been only four such Security Council summits.
[00:46:55.894 --> 00:47:02.157]  I called for this one so that we may address, at the highest level, a fundamental threat to the security of all peoples and all nations.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.141]  The spread and use of nuclear weapons.
[00:47:06.141 --> 00:47:11.964]  The resolution calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent military usage or theft.
[00:47:11.964 --> 00:47:12.564]  The U.S.
[00:47:12.564 --> 00:47:16.305]  wants the resolution to provide momentum for action on nukes.
[00:47:16.305 --> 00:47:18.746]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:47:18.746 --> 00:47:27.650]  How did they sell the League of Nations after the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and others, British intelligence on record, staged the assassination of the Archduke to start World War I?
[00:47:30.987 --> 00:47:32.568]  They said, we have to have this to end war.
[00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:33.608]  Then they got their League of Nations.
[00:47:33.608 --> 00:47:36.949]  Then they staged World War II, telling Hitler to go ahead and invade.
[00:47:36.949 --> 00:47:38.650]  That's now been declassified.
[00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.230]  Then setting him up.
[00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.651]  Not saying he's good, it's just the fact they set him up.
[00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:48.553]  That's why the Deputy Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, flew into England with the treaty, saying, look, we signed a secret treaty.
[00:47:48.553 --> 00:47:50.013]  The King of England had to advocate.
[00:47:50.013 --> 00:47:52.854]  He'd been a Nazi.
[00:47:52.854 --> 00:47:54.555]  But now, they've always pushed the U.N.
[00:47:54.555 --> 00:48:00.137]  Oh, we've got to have a world government, global governance, to stop a nuclear war, while the globalists give nukes out to everybody.
[00:48:00.865 --> 00:48:08.130]  They gave it to Russia, they gave it to China on record, they gave it to Pakistan, they gave it to South Africa, they gave it to Israel.
[00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.191]  And now, oh we gotta have a world government to stop nukes spreading.
[00:48:11.191 --> 00:48:15.014]  So that's just the front, but the real power they want is financial.
[00:48:15.014 --> 00:48:24.119]  Now here is Obama, this is directly from the UN, gaveling in the Security Council as the President of the World.
[00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:27.201]  Here it is.
[00:48:27.201 --> 00:48:28.082]  That's the UN intro.
[00:48:39.852 --> 00:48:47.757]  The 6191st meeting of the Security Council is called to order.
[00:48:47.757 --> 00:49:08.250]  The provisional agenda for this meeting is before the Council in document S-slash-agenda-slash-6191, which reads, quote, maintenance of international peace and security, nuclear proliferation, and nuclear disarmament.
[00:49:09.909 --> 00:49:15.594]  Unless I hear any objection, I shall consider the agenda adopted.
[00:49:15.594 --> 00:49:19.117]  Agenda is adopted.
[00:49:19.117 --> 00:49:30.948]  I wish to warmly welcome the distinguished heads of state and government, the Secretary General, the Director General of the IAEA,
[00:49:32.406 --> 00:49:37.368]  Ministers and other distinguished representatives present in the Security Council Chamber.
[00:49:37.368 --> 00:49:43.810]  Your presence is an affirmation of the importance of the subject matter to be discussed.
[00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:49.733]  The Security Council Summit will now begin its consideration of item two of the agenda.
[00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:51.873]  Alright.
[00:49:51.873 --> 00:49:55.235]  You can go watch hours of it online at the UN if you want.
[00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:57.896]  That's directly from the United Nations, what we just played.
[00:49:59.912 --> 00:50:02.596]  He is the president of the world.
[00:50:02.596 --> 00:50:05.160]  And that's how this sick system works with the 15 members.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.964]  They each get to be president of the world, and that's how they consider themselves.
[00:50:07.964 --> 00:50:12.010]  That's what they are openly announced as.
[00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.375]  And coming up in 15 months again, he will be the president of the world one more time.
[00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:22.429]  And in all the Financial Times of London headlines and a whole bunch of others, they say this is cementing world government.
[00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:23.990]  That Obama is bringing the U.S.
[00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.670]  into world government.
[00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.331]  That he is relinquishing U.S.
[00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:28.172]  control over the world government.
[00:50:28.172 --> 00:50:29.353]  It's well known the U.S.
[00:50:29.353 --> 00:50:31.154]  runs the world government right now.
[00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:38.617]  And it was the Pentagon in 1946 that created the United Nations at the Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco.
[00:50:38.617 --> 00:50:45.181]  The Rockefellers put the money up for it there, to lease the base, and in New York.
[00:50:45.181 --> 00:50:45.621]  And so,
[00:50:47.489 --> 00:50:51.656]  This is a horrible day for our nation.
[00:50:51.656 --> 00:50:57.365]  Our military, our government, our traders, they've totally sold us out, and they're gonna steal everything that's even nailed down.
[00:50:57.365 --> 00:50:57.866]  You got that?
[00:51:00.751 --> 00:51:04.134]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:51:04.134 --> 00:51:08.038]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:51:08.038 --> 00:51:11.762]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:51:11.762 --> 00:51:19.630]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants
[00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.090]  We're good to go.
[00:51:44.997 --> 00:51:50.501]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:50.501 --> 00:51:53.243]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.542]  Who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.542 --> 00:52:12.363]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:13.184]  This is his MO.
[00:52:13.184 --> 00:52:14.726]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.726 --> 00:52:16.708]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.708 --> 00:52:23.876]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.876 --> 00:52:24.357]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.357 --> 00:52:30.044]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.684 --> 00:52:34.207]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.207 --> 00:52:36.989]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.979 --> 00:53:08.261]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[00:53:08.261 --> 00:53:11.682]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?
[00:53:11.682 --> 00:53:12.843]  Well, now you can.
[00:53:12.843 --> 00:53:15.003]  Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[00:53:15.003 --> 00:53:23.426]  The Magic Yellow Flyer marketing system is the most effective and inexpensive way to build a referral-only service business in a short period of time.
[00:53:23.426 --> 00:53:26.387]  Get new customers and build a solid customer base.
[00:53:26.687 --> 00:53:30.508]  Throw away all of the other ineffective and expensive advertising methods.
[00:53:30.508 --> 00:53:32.249]  You need the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[00:53:32.249 --> 00:53:37.230]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.
[00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:42.111]  No matter what business you're in, the Magic Yellow Flyer marketing system will work for you.
[00:53:42.111 --> 00:53:43.371]  Don't have a home business?
[00:53:43.371 --> 00:53:48.933]  The Magic Yellow Flyer comes with 15 hot home businesses that you can start at a minimum cost.
[00:53:49.193 --> 00:53:49.814]  I was a highway man
[00:54:10.339 --> 00:54:11.920]  We're going under U.N.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.461]  law.
[00:54:12.461 --> 00:54:17.364]  They're going to incrementally take all of your children from you.
[00:54:17.364 --> 00:54:24.528]  They're going to home inspect you every month for environmental and social issues.
[00:54:24.528 --> 00:54:26.409]  They're going to inspect your garage sales.
[00:54:26.409 --> 00:54:30.431]  It's going to be $15 million fines, $100,000 fines first infraction, $15 million fines second infraction.
[00:54:33.797 --> 00:54:36.618]  They're going to have warrantless checkpoints taking your blood.
[00:54:36.618 --> 00:54:39.239]  They're going to continue to take your blood at birth under a U.N.
[00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:41.801]  program, 36 years old, putting a U.N.
[00:54:41.801 --> 00:54:46.223]  bioweapons registry for race-specific bioweapons.
[00:54:46.223 --> 00:55:02.670]  They're going to set up world government, they're going to carry out forced population reduction, they're going to put more poison in the water and food, more GMO, and they're going to just watch everybody die, everybody become mentally retarded, everybody literally just falling dead around you incrementally, testing it, gauging it.
[00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:10.974]  Until it's just completely normal that everybody has cancer, everybody's dying, and the globalists are just laughing and giggling and snickering about it.
[00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.054]  Yeah, that sounds like a nightmare.
[00:55:12.054 --> 00:55:12.875]  Well, it is.
[00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:13.895]  Hitler was a nightmare.
[00:55:13.895 --> 00:55:15.196]  Stalin was a nightmare.
[00:55:15.196 --> 00:55:15.996]  Mao was a nightmare.
[00:55:15.996 --> 00:55:18.097]  They were all funded by these people.
[00:55:18.097 --> 00:55:19.018]  Pol Pot.
[00:55:19.018 --> 00:55:20.339]  All of them.
[00:55:20.339 --> 00:55:21.759]  We have the government documents.
[00:55:21.759 --> 00:55:22.880]  We have the proof.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:29.123]  It isn't just a world government that's going to tax you and run your life with Tobin taxes and money transfer taxes and carbon taxes.
[00:55:30.765 --> 00:55:41.828]  World government is only the tool, as John P. Holder in White House Science Czar says, the planetary regime is the tool to kill you!
[00:55:41.828 --> 00:55:57.912]  And the reason they may succeed is because it's so bold, it's so off the charts, it's so outrageous, it's so criminal, it's so corrupt, that they would openly in the last year, still over 50 trillion worldwide, 23.7 trillion,
[00:55:59.892 --> 00:56:01.133]  And again, that's a two-month-old number.
[00:56:01.133 --> 00:56:03.355]  It'll be 28-trill following the trend.
[00:56:03.355 --> 00:56:07.118]  Next time, 28-trill plus.
[00:56:07.118 --> 00:56:09.840]  I always underestimate what it's going to be next time they announce it every two months.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.501]  We're due to hear.
[00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:13.422]  It's $23.7 trillion almost two months ago.
[00:56:13.422 --> 00:56:14.864]  We're due to hear the new number.
[00:56:14.864 --> 00:56:17.005]  And I cringe.
[00:56:17.005 --> 00:56:24.291]  And they just are openly stealing every Treasury blind, openly deploying police and military on the streets everywhere, openly coming in with tyranny.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.803]  Now, if we speak out and point out that it's just a group of private bankers doing this, we can start reversing it.
[00:56:31.803 --> 00:56:35.785]  That's why one of our biggest hopes is Ron Paul's resolution to audit these people.
[00:56:35.785 --> 00:56:40.427]  Because we're starting the process and beginning to really draw blood in the fight.
[00:56:40.427 --> 00:56:45.789]  Really beginning to land some strong punches on the enemy that people are now going, wait, banks run the country?
[00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:47.830]  Private banks control the government?
[00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.171]  All over the world people are finding out?
[00:56:50.171 --> 00:56:51.792]  As the end the Fed movement goes global?
[00:56:52.602 --> 00:56:53.782]  Then they're starting to get scared.
[00:56:53.782 --> 00:56:56.363]  That's why they're accelerating their program right now.
[00:56:56.363 --> 00:56:59.144]  They were trying incremental, but they were starting to fail.
[00:56:59.144 --> 00:57:01.565]  They realize they're now behind the eight ball.
[00:57:01.565 --> 00:57:03.906]  This is red-level emergency!
[00:57:03.906 --> 00:57:04.786]  This is real!
[00:57:04.786 --> 00:57:06.927]  Gut up and get educated about this stuff!
[00:57:09.108 --> 00:57:13.434]  I know that you want to rationalize and tell yourself this isn't true because it's scary.
[00:57:13.434 --> 00:57:15.216]  But listen, it is real.
[00:57:15.216 --> 00:57:22.686]  We've proven it's real in Endgame and Terror Storm and the Obama deception and all the mainstream news is now confirming everything we told you.
[00:57:22.686 --> 00:57:26.090]  But they put their own sick spin on it.
[00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:26.972]  And support us!
[00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:45.618]  That's why the establishment with the mainstream media and alternative media attacks Ron Paul, attacks me, attacks anybody that they know is effectively countering them to try to get everybody fighting with each other with divide and conquer instead of identifying the new world order.
[00:57:45.618 --> 00:57:47.379]  Ron Paul isn't the one raising your taxes.
[00:57:47.379 --> 00:57:49.841]  Ron Paul isn't the one bringing in a world carbon tax.
[00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:53.183]  Ron Paul isn't the one taking over our economy.
[00:57:53.183 --> 00:57:53.824]  Alex Jones
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.761]  That's me.
[00:57:56.761 --> 00:57:58.342]  I'm not the one that runs your life.
[00:57:58.342 --> 00:58:01.924]  I'm not the one that's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and trying to make you take them.
[00:58:01.924 --> 00:58:07.888]  And so when the feds try to get us all in fighting, realize that that's their attempt with COINTELPRO.
[00:58:07.888 --> 00:58:13.731]  And they also use just the general public's jealousy of anybody successful to play us off against each other.
[00:58:13.731 --> 00:58:16.533]  You ever seen crabs in a bucket if you're crab fishing at the beach?
[00:58:16.533 --> 00:58:19.435]  Put three or four in the bucket, they could climb out if they worked with each other.
[00:58:19.435 --> 00:58:22.777]  But any crab that tries to climb out, they all run over and pinch him and drag him down.
[00:58:24.099 --> 00:58:35.269]  If we don't get over the crab-in-the-bucket syndrome... Well, you're gonna see what's gonna happen, but we are mounting a successful offensive against the enemy.
[00:58:35.269 --> 00:58:42.836]  We'll be right back with reports from the G20 from our reporters.
[00:58:42.836 --> 00:58:45.339]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.339 --> 00:58:47.641]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.196 --> 00:58:54.440]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.442]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.442 --> 00:59:04.971]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:04.971 --> 00:59:10.536]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.536 --> 00:59:12.138]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.378 --> 00:59:18.883]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:18.883 --> 00:59:29.951]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:29.951 --> 00:59:30.711]  That's right.
[00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:33.273]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.273 --> 00:59:34.894]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:34.894 --> 00:59:35.094]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:41.459 --> 00:59:41.779]  Big Brother.
[00:59:41.779 --> 00:59:42.499]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:42.499 --> 00:59:43.840]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.600]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.545 --> 01:00:12.466]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.466 --> 01:00:17.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.312 --> 01:00:21.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.692 --> 01:00:45.696]  We are live at the G20 Summit as open world government is being announced.
[01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:56.441]  President Obama has been announced as President of the World at the UN, and he legally taken the chairmanship of the UN Security Council, the only true governing body in the UN that has power.
[01:00:56.441 --> 01:01:01.704]  The General Assembly is a puppet, powerless assembly, and the Assembly admits that.
[01:01:01.704 --> 01:01:04.765]  He's now more powerful than the UN Secretary General.
[01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:06.466]  He's now more powerful than the US President.
[01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:07.567]  He holds the dual post.
[01:01:08.755 --> 01:01:17.182]  Jason Douglas is with us live from protest in day two of the opening announcement for world government.
[01:01:17.182 --> 01:01:22.126]  At the end of the dollar, Jason Bermas is at another location.
[01:01:22.126 --> 01:01:28.151]  We'll go to both of them after the break when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv with a complete report.
[01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:31.433]  Jason Douglas, what are you witnessing right now?
[01:01:31.433 --> 01:01:34.396]  Right now I'm in the middle of the United Steelworkers Union.
[01:01:35.226 --> 01:01:43.148]  And, uh, there are so many groups here, all very disgruntled at what's happening with the current state of the world.
[01:01:43.148 --> 01:01:46.248]  We are just marching off the UPenn campus.
[01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:49.309]  Uh, I would estimate there's about 2,000 plus people here.
[01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:56.330]  It's still very peaceful, you know, people just speaking their minds and, uh, marching forward.
[01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:58.651]  Can you use the sound cannons on us again?
[01:02:00.762 --> 01:02:02.784]  Well, just to be clear how this works.
[01:02:02.784 --> 01:02:07.968]  The city has said no protest allowed, no permits being issued, no first amendment.
[01:02:07.968 --> 01:02:21.119]  And so right at the time the police are about to engage the peaceful people, 10 to 15 hired federal agents dressed as anarchists will tump over a few trash cans for a staged CNN, Fox News photo op.
[01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:23.381]  They will then attack the peaceful crowd.
[01:02:23.381 --> 01:02:27.404]  The police will with beanbags, rubber bullets, pepper spray, CS,
[01:02:29.406 --> 01:02:31.268]  And the sound weapons.
[01:02:31.268 --> 01:02:32.849]  This is the MO.
[01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:49.087]  It's key, Jason, that you show people on video how right when the police arrive and try to block you and announce that it's an unlawful assembly, the public would see that on the news as abusive unless the staged anarchists give them the pretext to attack.
[01:02:49.087 --> 01:02:49.788]  That will happen.
[01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:51.518]  Exactly.
[01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:55.820]  They are definitely looking for any sort of excuse.
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:59.241]  I mean, they're all battle-ready.
[01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:03.522]  People are just walking around, speaking their minds.
[01:03:03.522 --> 01:03:13.906]  You do have these small enclaves of people that are, you know, they're pretending that they're really dissatisfied, but it's just obvious that they're hired.
[01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:15.687]  Where is everybody marching to?
[01:03:17.023 --> 01:03:19.225]  Uh, we're trying to make it to the convention center.
[01:03:19.225 --> 01:03:24.190]  They wouldn't even let the permitted protest go that direction.
[01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:31.136]  Um, you know, they're just ostriches with their heads in the air.
[01:03:31.136 --> 01:03:34.039]  There was one on the 20th, and they wouldn't even let that one go.
[01:03:34.039 --> 01:03:37.963]  There wasn't even any one down at the convention center, but they still didn't let it go down there.
[01:03:38.956 --> 01:03:53.387]  We've seen photos and videos of the sound weapon trucks, armored vehicles, even in neighborhoods, Jason, where there's literally one or two people on the street, like a nine-year-old kid with a ball in his front yard, and they still drive by and blast them.
[01:03:53.387 --> 01:03:56.249]  Yeah, yeah, they're right by people's homes.
[01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.510]  I was standing by one home.
[01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:03.314]  It had, you know, several family members out on the stoop with their baby, and they blast the sound cannon.
[01:04:03.314 --> 01:04:05.776]  And it just feels like your eardrums are going to blow out of
[01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:07.444]  So that is confirmed.
[01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:12.087]  Yesterday or today you saw them blast a family with a baby on their front porch?
[01:04:12.087 --> 01:04:12.747]  It's confirmed.
[01:04:12.747 --> 01:04:16.329]  I saw them, you know, they were blasting all of them.
[01:04:16.329 --> 01:04:18.170]  Well this is unbelievable.
[01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:28.857]  I remember in Portland five years ago, an anti-war march, they came and blocked it in and came up and sprayed babies in baby carriages and the mother said, why are you spraying my baby?
[01:04:28.857 --> 01:04:33.860]  And the policeman said, listen you effing bleeper, you shouldn't bring a kid to a protest.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.721]  So they love targeting children especially.
[01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:41.607]  Well, what else do you expect from Satanists?
[01:04:41.607 --> 01:04:44.249]  Even if they don't know they're Satanists, that's what they are.
[01:04:44.249 --> 01:04:47.692]  Stay there, Jason Douglas, Rob Due, with you.
[01:04:47.692 --> 01:04:51.114]  We'll also get a report from another area with Jason Burmas.
[01:04:51.114 --> 01:04:55.998]  Straight ahead, we're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus three minutes.
[01:04:55.998 --> 01:04:57.580]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:05.666]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:10.192]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.192 --> 01:05:12.475]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:14.097]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.097 --> 01:05:15.139]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:23.781]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.781 --> 01:05:31.243]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:05:37.265 --> 01:05:43.286]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:03.620]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:07.241]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:11.803]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.803 --> 01:06:17.405]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.705 --> 01:06:22.469]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.469 --> 01:06:26.092]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.092 --> 01:06:30.916]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:37.482]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.482 --> 01:06:39.424]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.904 --> 01:06:43.105]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:54.449]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:07:08.686 --> 01:07:13.287]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:07:13.287 --> 01:07:17.908]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:24.070]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:27.591]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:07:27.591 --> 01:07:31.852]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:07:32.332 --> 01:07:32.552]  I think so.
[01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:08.853]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.853 --> 01:08:17.940]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:20.202]  That is the sounds of the march.
[01:08:20.202 --> 01:08:28.389]  We estimate to be more than 2,000 people in Pittsburgh marching from the University to the Convention Center where the G20 is meeting.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.061]  Jason Bermas is there at the head of the march.
[01:08:32.061 --> 01:08:37.342]  At the end of the march is Rob Dew and Jason Douglas will be going to all of them.
[01:08:37.342 --> 01:08:41.524]  I'll be recapping all the big developments that have happened.
[01:08:41.524 --> 01:08:46.165]  They are using sound cannons even in neighborhoods on children and people on their front porches.
[01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:52.287]  They go into even small size streets and announce no one allowed on the streets basically of Pittsburgh.
[01:08:52.287 --> 01:08:54.648]  They invoke the state's Patriot Act that they have.
[01:08:54.648 --> 01:08:55.648]  It's very draconian.
[01:08:57.215 --> 01:08:59.337]  It has been confirmed they're using sound cannons.
[01:08:59.337 --> 01:09:00.517]  Even CNN admits that.
[01:09:00.517 --> 01:09:04.460]  But neocon sites are denying it exists.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.981]  Because they're basically pentagon run.
[01:09:05.981 --> 01:09:07.281]  That's a military tactic.
[01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:09.203]  They're still saying there's no new world order.
[01:09:09.203 --> 01:09:11.064]  They're still saying there's no bank of the world.
[01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.945]  They're still saying there's no global carbon tax in the media.
[01:09:13.945 --> 01:09:16.227]  As they simultaneously announce it.
[01:09:16.227 --> 01:09:18.448]  That's a psychological warfare tactic.
[01:09:18.448 --> 01:09:21.430]  To say, we're not assaulting you while they're assaulting.
[01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:24.272]  Mindless neocons claim G20 abduction video was fake.
[01:09:25.123 --> 01:09:26.263]  It is clearly not fake.
[01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:33.626]  These are real military officers and a real police crown vic jumping out and grabbing a protester and dragging him away.
[01:09:33.626 --> 01:09:43.570]  I'm saying that it could be staged in that it's real military, we know that, but that they could be staging snatching grabs as we know they did in Ottawa.
[01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:51.994]  The Royal Mounted Police have admitted last year that they staged an attack on their own police, then had to fake arrest the anarchist,
[01:09:52.847 --> 01:09:54.458]  Put them into police cars.
[01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:56.049]  That's admitted Toronto Sun.
[01:09:57.864 --> 01:10:03.125]  But of course, the neocon websites are not going to admit that.
[01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:11.707]  They're just going to keep saying, nothing's happening, there's no sound cannons, none of this is going on, stand down, this is not an assault, classic Pentagon operation.
[01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:19.969]  They're also, of course, saying that the video of sound cannons and police in black uniforms and the army sound cannoning people, including children, is fake.
[01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:26.450]  It's all admitted, but they're going to make it about a debate of whether it's real or not, so we never psychologically have a debate
[01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:31.719]  on whether it's good to have the military sound canoning children and saying no protest allowed.
[01:10:31.719 --> 01:10:34.043]  They may even say Pittsburgh doesn't exist.
[01:10:34.043 --> 01:10:36.327]  They may even say Pennsylvania doesn't exist.
[01:10:36.327 --> 01:10:39.493]  So you will then debate with them that Pennsylvania exists.
[01:10:40.865 --> 01:10:46.271]  There are over 8,000 news articles today on Google News if you put the term New World Order in.
[01:10:46.271 --> 01:10:47.572]  Over 8,000.
[01:10:47.572 --> 01:10:50.936]  Openly announcing it's a global government, global tax, that the U.S.
[01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:55.941]  is going down, that Obama's great for being the new president of the world, chairing the U.N.
[01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:57.043]  Security Council.
[01:10:57.043 --> 01:10:57.443]  The U.N.
[01:10:57.443 --> 01:10:59.065]  Security Council exists.
[01:10:59.065 --> 01:11:00.747]  Obama exists.
[01:11:00.747 --> 01:11:01.728]  All of this exists.
[01:11:02.288 --> 01:11:10.115]  But if they can just keep saying it doesn't exist, while they say it exists and it's good, then when you say I don't like it, they then say it doesn't exist.
[01:11:10.115 --> 01:11:12.677]  Burmas, that is classical psychological warfare.
[01:11:12.677 --> 01:11:16.460]  Jason Burmas reporting from the head of the march in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:11:18.075 --> 01:11:19.237]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:19.237 --> 01:11:22.941]  Right now, it looks like a little over 2,000 people.
[01:11:22.941 --> 01:11:25.625]  They are condensed into one street.
[01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:30.231]  There seems to be much less of a police presence at this march, at least at the moment.
[01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:33.335]  We're not really anywhere near downtown Pittsburgh yet.
[01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:38.757]  So we'll see what happens as we approach it if they let us go over into the downtown area.
[01:11:38.757 --> 01:11:40.738]  I highly doubt it.
[01:11:40.738 --> 01:11:45.821]  The downtown area is where you see the heaviest concentration of military.
[01:11:45.821 --> 01:11:48.862]  Right now I'm taping, and this is more of an eclectic group.
[01:11:48.862 --> 01:11:52.804]  Yesterday I didn't see any of the Iraqi war veterans against the war.
[01:11:52.804 --> 01:11:54.925]  Here I'm seeing dozens if not hundreds.
[01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:59.667]  I'm seeing around 100, 150 free to prep protesters.
[01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:08.631]  It seems like, you know, although there is an anarchist element here, they're somewhere towards the middle of the crowd, and we can only hope that they won't be able to provocateur the event today.
[01:12:09.912 --> 01:12:17.279]  Well, what they're going to do is they're going to wait until you get to the place where the police are masked in front and to the sides.
[01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:22.664]  Then once you get into the trap, police will come from behind.
[01:12:22.664 --> 01:12:27.809]  Then the anarchists for the news media will then come out of the middle, go to the front,
[01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:35.619]  They'll probably stage it with the police on a hill so they can roll a garbage dumpster at them for dramatic effect like they did yesterday.
[01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:44.870]  They'll then open fire with rubber bullets, pepper spray, and sound cannons on the 2000 so the media can replay yesterday and every other big event we've seen.
[01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:46.011]  Here's the key, Burmas.
[01:12:46.872 --> 01:12:48.913]  Jason Burmas reporting from Pittsburgh.
[01:12:48.913 --> 01:12:52.674]  We're going to play this video which the neocons are saying is fake.
[01:12:52.674 --> 01:12:54.374]  They're saying it's not real military.
[01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:56.035]  It's clearly real military.
[01:12:56.035 --> 01:12:58.356]  They're clearly wearing the real badge.
[01:12:58.356 --> 01:13:04.077]  It's a plastic clear badge with a white badge for the police to recognize in the arm.
[01:13:04.077 --> 01:13:06.058]  It's clearly an unmarked Crown Vic.
[01:13:06.678 --> 01:13:07.319]  You can look.
[01:13:07.319 --> 01:13:08.240]  It's military.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.721]  They're well conditioned.
[01:13:09.721 --> 01:13:10.902]  They're in good shape.
[01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:13.525]  They're big military police cops.
[01:13:13.525 --> 01:13:17.288]  You see the classic hired informant types giving hand signals.
[01:13:17.288 --> 01:13:21.432]  When you watch the video, they're giving hand signals to the police.
[01:13:22.393 --> 01:13:31.696]  Uh, and, and they, the guy is smiling and laughing, and the cops are, just like the urban warfare drills they do, they then do the drills live action, but don't tell people they're drills.
[01:13:31.696 --> 01:13:39.779]  I'm almost sure watching this video as they throw him in, he's laughing, then the guy with him gives a hand signal to police, they drive off into tear gas.
[01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:51.502]  This is a PSYOP to sell people on the idea that the military pulls up and grabs you into a car, and that's how they protect their people that have just engaged in some type of violence.
[01:13:51.502 --> 01:13:54.543]  We didn't see that on the video, but the video is very short.
[01:13:54.543 --> 01:13:58.844]  That may have happened earlier for the police to have a pretext to crack down on people.
[01:13:58.844 --> 01:13:59.524]  Jason Burmess.
[01:14:01.874 --> 01:14:03.196]  Big possibility, Alex.
[01:14:03.196 --> 01:14:04.597]  Again, we're so far out.
[01:14:04.597 --> 01:14:08.222]  I mean, right now, I'm standing next to a bailout sign.
[01:14:08.222 --> 01:14:11.086]  They've got $12 trillion in counting.
[01:14:11.086 --> 01:14:15.831]  Of course, we know it's over $27 trillion at this point.
[01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:17.413]  This is a great turnout, Alex.
[01:14:17.413 --> 01:14:18.675]  I would really hate to see this
[01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:23.537]  Of course we saw the chaos yesterday, and you know, I'm prepared for anything.
[01:14:23.537 --> 01:14:28.839]  Hopefully I'm going to get to be able to talk to some of these protesters when we get down to the downtown area.
[01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:34.261]  But I am seeing a lot of signs that are really busting through the left-right paradigm.
[01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:40.283]  A few people have an amalgamation of both Barack Obama and George Bush as one being.
[01:14:40.283 --> 01:14:41.104]  They get it.
[01:14:41.104 --> 01:14:42.984]  They understand this war is not over.
[01:14:42.984 --> 01:14:44.165]  This war is not ending.
[01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:46.166]  The economy is only getting worse.
[01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:48.688]  We are moving towards global governance.
[01:14:48.688 --> 01:14:53.252]  Of course you have a lot of well-meaning idiots out here as well, but we can only hope to reach them, Alex.
[01:14:54.878 --> 01:15:08.891]  Well, we're playing video right now of last night at the university with police and military and military and riot gear with shotguns with rubber bullets that will kill you if they shoot you from five, ten feet away in many cases.
[01:15:08.891 --> 01:15:10.072]  There's been a lot of that.
[01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:14.757]  And they come up with a billy club and attack an innocent woman and tackle her for absolutely no reason.
[01:15:16.584 --> 01:15:26.948]  Yesterday, when I was able to catch the local news after everything had died down and basically we had been warded into a corner where we couldn't go anywhere for about an hour.
[01:15:26.948 --> 01:15:29.749]  They wouldn't let us over a bridge, even on foot.
[01:15:29.749 --> 01:15:31.370]  I saw this one girl.
[01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:33.791]  She must have been, you know, 100 pounds.
[01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:38.032]  I had interviewed her earlier in the day because she had a very provocative sign.
[01:15:38.032 --> 01:15:39.873]  She had a sign that said, smack an anarchist.
[01:15:40.473 --> 01:15:44.195]  And when I went and talked to her about it, she said, look, I'm all about free speech.
[01:15:44.195 --> 01:15:45.756]  I'm all about protesting.
[01:15:45.756 --> 01:15:52.199]  But when you get dressed up in black and you put a black mask on and you're here to destroy property, what is that going to accomplish?
[01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:53.279]  And I was like, right on.
[01:15:53.279 --> 01:15:54.800]  You know, you're dead right.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.701]  You know, we have our freedom of speech, but those people aren't helping.
[01:15:57.701 --> 01:15:59.082]  And that's the girl they arrest.
[01:15:59.082 --> 01:16:05.585]  This girl with a sign who is out there on her own trying to exercise her free speech and enlighten people to the fact that, listen,
[01:16:06.005 --> 01:16:11.452]  You don't need to, you know, dress in all black and think you're a tough guy and follow along with the tour.
[01:16:11.452 --> 01:16:19.621]  For instance, Wendy Sheehan actually went to the anarchist meeting the night before last, before yesterday's protest, and was kicked out.
[01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:20.683]  They didn't want her there.
[01:16:20.683 --> 01:16:26.149]  They don't want legitimate voices amongst them because they know they control the idiot masses.
[01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:38.836]  Well, I'm watching the video of the guy that was arrested by the police after the military grabbed the one guy, and this looks fake to me.
[01:16:38.836 --> 01:16:41.618]  Clearly, with the other guy, it is fake.
[01:16:41.618 --> 01:16:47.541]  But if this person isn't an operative, he needs to later contact us and explain to us what happened.
[01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:56.206]  But talking to Douglas, talking to you, Bermas, Douglas has said it clearly looks staged with what he's seen.
[01:16:56.206 --> 01:16:57.587]  What do you think of these anarchists?
[01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.593]  Well, you know, I think a lot of them are just well-meaning idiots.
[01:17:01.593 --> 01:17:07.097]  However, the people in charge, the people that are directing them, obviously have an agenda.
[01:17:07.097 --> 01:17:14.864]  Um, you know, I got an interview with about 20 of the anarchists yesterday, prior to the march, and I mean, they were just, it was idiocy.
[01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:15.164]  I'm like,
[01:17:15.604 --> 01:17:19.605]  Well, what your group is called, Blotten, they were like, Team Spacebag.
[01:17:19.605 --> 01:17:22.826]  And I'm like, what does Team Spacebag even mean?
[01:17:22.826 --> 01:17:25.047]  And no one could tell me, they all just gave me a dumb look.
[01:17:25.047 --> 01:17:27.667]  They're just like, anarchy!
[01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:28.327]  Anarchy!
[01:17:28.327 --> 01:17:32.749]  And they said some other vulgar things, but none of the issues were being discussed.
[01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:37.770]  They had no other objective other than to be there and try to rebel against something they know nothing about.
[01:17:39.312 --> 01:17:57.338]  Well, that's how it works, is that we've been in the Fed protests and other places, and these anarchists will come in who are well-spoken, in good shape, and they'll say, come on, let's cause trouble, let's do something bad, and then in the Fed protestors have caught them later going, yeah, we can't get these people to even jaywalk, what are we gonna do?
[01:17:57.338 --> 01:18:08.281]  And over and over again, the Feds have been caught provocateuring, state police have been caught going into meetings and getting maybe one out of a thousand people in a warehouse to say they'll do something violent, and then they raid the whole facility.
[01:18:11.873 --> 01:18:13.193]  We hope that doesn't happen again.
[01:18:22.657 --> 01:18:24.859]  Again, Alex, we'll see when we get down there.
[01:18:24.859 --> 01:18:28.322]  Right now, the police presence is very, very slim.
[01:18:28.322 --> 01:18:31.284]  The guards are not armed to the teeth as they were yesterday.
[01:18:31.284 --> 01:18:33.686]  I have yet to see any military.
[01:18:33.686 --> 01:18:38.871]  Really, the biggest concentration of riot police was at the university on the way in.
[01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:41.413]  Of course, this protest took place as
[01:18:42.954 --> 01:18:44.676]  But Burmas, this is how it always works.
[01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:48.399]  They want the march concentrated because it's easier to block in.
[01:18:48.399 --> 01:19:00.949]  Once you near your destination, that's when, watch, they're going to come out and block the street, then come in on the sides, let you fill up the pincer movement, and then they're going to close the gate on the back of you.
[01:19:03.178 --> 01:19:16.828]  And there's been a lot of tear gassing going on, a lot of microwave gunning going on, I mean a lot of sound cannoning going on, and meanwhile the neocons are denying on their websites that any of this is even happening.
[01:19:32.011 --> 01:19:33.311]  Well, it's just incredible, Alex.
[01:19:33.311 --> 01:19:38.333]  I mean, I don't know how the mainstream media is going to cover this, but this is at least 2,000 people.
[01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:40.033]  This may be on the brink of 3,000.
[01:19:40.033 --> 01:19:46.055]  Uh, you know, just milling my way to the front of the, uh, line took me about 15, 20 minutes.
[01:19:46.055 --> 01:19:48.215]  Burmese, do we know why they attacked?
[01:19:48.215 --> 01:19:49.236]  I'm gonna ask this when we come back.
[01:19:49.236 --> 01:19:50.256]  I'm gonna ask Douglas as well.
[01:19:50.256 --> 01:19:51.636]  Stay there, Jason Douglas.
[01:19:51.636 --> 01:19:55.097]  Also, in another area of the March, why did they attack the university last night?
[01:19:55.097 --> 01:19:57.618]  I mean, I've got video of them attacking frat kids.
[01:20:01.084 --> 01:20:07.788]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.788 --> 01:20:09.449]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.449 --> 01:20:14.052]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:14.052 --> 01:20:21.716]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:24.198]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.358 --> 01:20:26.579]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:20:26.579 --> 01:20:28.521]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:32.843]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.

[01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:18.354]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:18.354 --> 01:21:19.495]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.755 --> 01:21:28.223]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:28.223 --> 01:21:31.626]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.626 --> 01:21:35.890]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.492]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.895]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:45.059]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:45.259 --> 01:21:46.160]  You should too.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.301]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:47.301 --> 01:21:50.223]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:50.223 --> 01:21:50.283]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.283 --> 01:21:50.363]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.363 --> 01:21:50.704]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.696 --> 01:22:07.743]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.743 --> 01:22:13.630]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:19.777]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:20.117 --> 01:22:22.078]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.078 --> 01:22:24.540]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:37.728]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.728 --> 01:22:39.409]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.409 --> 01:22:41.270]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:47.474]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:48.166 --> 01:22:56.438]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.020]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.201]  The people strike back!
[01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:04.804]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:23:04.804 --> 01:23:14.952]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:23:14.952 --> 01:23:22.198]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:23:22.438 --> 01:23:36.729]  If you're ready to live your life free of sickness, pain and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy and youthfulness and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[01:23:36.729 --> 01:23:47.898]  Heart and Body Extract has a 23-year proven track record of using certified organic herbs that make up an excellent formula to balance and support the heart and circulatory system in as little as
[01:23:48.018 --> 01:23:48.278]  We're good.
[01:24:09.838 --> 01:24:23.407]  Alright, we're now going to Jason Douglas who's with Rob Due in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in another area of the 2,000 plus people that we estimate are marching right now from Pitt, there in Pittsburgh, into another area of the city.
[01:24:23.407 --> 01:24:26.790]  Where again are you guys marching, Jason Douglas?
[01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:31.953]  Right now we are at Seneca Street and 5th Avenue.
[01:24:31.953 --> 01:24:34.435]  We're in between the Convention Center and UPenn.
[01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:53.169]  Usually they attack on the first official day because they want to set the precedent that protesting is bad and you're violent and bad.
[01:24:53.169 --> 01:24:55.892]  But I think you're going to see even more tonight coming up.
[01:24:55.892 --> 01:24:56.353]  Continue.
[01:24:58.286 --> 01:25:06.593]  Um, basically I have a feeling that they're funneling us into someplace, then they'll start to splinter us off and then they'll close the gate just like they did yesterday.
[01:25:06.593 --> 01:25:08.334]  Yeah, that's the standard operating procedure.
[01:25:08.334 --> 01:25:10.095]  They may do something else.
[01:25:10.095 --> 01:25:18.882]  Uh, you've said on air, but can you elaborate that these people, these anarchists, act and behave like feds, the few engaged in violence?
[01:25:18.882 --> 01:25:25.828]  Right, well, basically you have a large group of people dressed in black with black masks and, you know, all saying anarchist type stuff.
[01:25:25.828 --> 01:25:27.289]  You can tell that the larger group
[01:25:27.898 --> 01:25:34.044]  You know, it's people that just want something else besides what we have right now, and are looking to anything.
[01:25:34.044 --> 01:25:53.461]  But then you have these capos that are basically in control of the larger group, and they're doing paramilitary stuff, where, you know, they're basically funneling people, they're obviously working in coordination, and then they do these spurts of violence.
[01:25:53.461 --> 01:25:54.382]  It's just provocation.
[01:25:55.433 --> 01:26:01.018]  I'm watching video from Pitt last night with the sound cannons hitting people.
[01:26:01.018 --> 01:26:02.759]  It's just unbelievably hardcore.
[01:26:02.759 --> 01:26:12.228]  For the radio listeners, you can go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and watch all these scores of videos we have posted to give you different snapshots of what happened.
[01:26:12.228 --> 01:26:16.912]  We're also streaming this live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, the video.
[01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:21.257]  Jason, I want these night time shots.
[01:26:21.257 --> 01:26:26.761]  The Darth Vader element of it is incredibly cinematic to get the point across in the next film.
[01:26:26.761 --> 01:26:29.723]  We were actually out last night.
[01:26:29.723 --> 01:26:35.788]  We drove right by the area that they said all the violence took place.
[01:26:35.788 --> 01:26:38.811]  We were thinking we were just there.
[01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:44.435]  So if an event happened, it was a coordinated event with the police and with the military.
[01:26:44.435 --> 01:26:45.876]  Because it happened in 15 minutes.
[01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.056]  Yeah, how they're treating us is
[01:27:15.433 --> 01:27:19.156]  And the cops love bugging their eyes out at everybody with pure hatred.
[01:27:19.156 --> 01:27:21.999]  I mean, they've really been trained to hate the citizenry of this nation.
[01:27:21.999 --> 01:27:25.842]  And he said, you better get that camera out of my face.
[01:27:25.842 --> 01:27:27.123]  It's like they're two different people.
[01:27:27.123 --> 01:27:30.526]  When they're in the line, they have a completely big stare.
[01:27:30.526 --> 01:27:32.328]  You know, you can tell they're combat hard.
[01:27:34.022 --> 01:27:42.044]  I've actually caught behind the lines, like just the guys, once they become guys and they just start talking to each other, they're questioning their order.
[01:27:42.044 --> 01:27:48.506]  They're actually, I heard some people saying something like, you know, these people are just, you know, want to be heard.
[01:27:48.506 --> 01:27:51.686]  Why can't, why can't they just let them speak?
[01:27:51.686 --> 01:27:53.887]  So there is dissension in the race.
[01:27:53.887 --> 01:27:57.488]  Um, we are having an effect out here.
[01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:05.233]  Well, the cops usually figure out later that there were provocateurs hired by the feds in there.
[01:28:05.233 --> 01:28:06.474]  Yet it's happened all over the nation.
[01:28:06.474 --> 01:28:15.520]  People that aren't aware of that latest incident was Denver Post reported on what happened last year at the DNC in Denver.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.882]  The police were posing as anarchists attacking other police.
[01:28:18.882 --> 01:28:22.184]  They also hire informants, federal informants, state informants.
[01:28:22.944 --> 01:28:31.110]  We've got Bob Chapman coming up for 30 minutes to break down what's happening with the economy and what the G20 is announcing they want to do with the economy.
[01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:39.436]  But I want to check back in with you guys in the last hour today, 3 o'clock Eastern, 2 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:28:39.436 --> 01:28:43.659]  And I also want to talk to Rob Dew at that time and check back in with Burmess.
[01:28:43.659 --> 01:28:45.121]  Thank you so much, Jason Douglas.
[01:28:45.121 --> 01:28:49.083]  Call us if any new developments happen or if they start closing the gap on you.
[01:28:50.624 --> 01:28:57.005]  Before 3 o'clock, if anything happens, which probably will, call in and we'll preempt programming to bring you up, okay?
[01:28:57.005 --> 01:29:00.526]  Okay, I'm gonna head to the head of the line and see if I can... Well, hold on.
[01:29:00.526 --> 01:29:01.566]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:01.566 --> 01:29:02.506]  Don't hang up though.
[01:29:02.506 --> 01:29:08.847]  I need to talk to Rob Due because he set up our next guest and we're having some conflicting issues here and it's been hard to get a hold of him.
[01:29:08.847 --> 01:29:14.388]  So I need you to get Rob Due so I can talk to him on the phone during this three-minute break, okay?
[01:29:14.388 --> 01:29:15.869]  Okay, I will try to find him.
[01:29:15.869 --> 01:29:18.449]  There's a lot of people here and we separated to do coverage.
[01:29:19.701 --> 01:29:20.861]  Oh, man.
[01:29:20.861 --> 01:29:24.282]  And we can't get him to answer his phone.
[01:29:24.282 --> 01:29:25.982]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with his phone.
[01:29:25.982 --> 01:29:27.462]  My phone's having a lot of problems, too.
[01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:33.923]  It seems like Pittsburgh only has one carrier, and so everybody else that's not on that carrier is having problems receiving calls.
[01:29:33.923 --> 01:29:36.364]  Well, the feds are known to jam them, too, at demonstrations.
[01:29:36.364 --> 01:29:38.344]  Look.
[01:29:38.344 --> 01:29:41.605]  Alright, I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:29:41.605 --> 01:29:45.665]  He's normally radio producing, doing some of that here, and we'll try to figure that out as well.
[01:29:45.665 --> 01:29:48.426]  I'm trying to get a hold of him since 9 o'clock this morning.
[01:29:48.426 --> 01:29:48.966]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.403 --> 01:29:55.305]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.305 --> 01:30:01.007]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.007 --> 01:30:04.028]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.028 --> 01:30:09.351]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.351 --> 01:30:11.391]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.391 --> 01:30:16.394]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.394 --> 01:30:17.334]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.574 --> 01:30:18.695]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.695 --> 01:30:20.576]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.576 --> 01:30:21.657]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.657 --> 01:30:23.858]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.858 --> 01:30:25.199]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.199 --> 01:30:26.720]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:32.004]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.004 --> 01:30:35.586]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.586 --> 01:30:39.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:40.610]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:41.531]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.531 --> 01:30:42.632]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.632 --> 01:30:43.553]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.553 --> 01:30:44.654]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.654 --> 01:30:47.716]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.716 --> 01:30:49.478]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:50.399]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:59.966 --> 01:31:05.293]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:09.819]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.819 --> 01:31:12.102]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.102 --> 01:31:13.724]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.724 --> 01:31:14.746]  There is a solution.
[01:31:14.986 --> 01:31:23.410]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:30.853]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:31:36.895 --> 01:31:42.917]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:47.059]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:32:00.316 --> 01:32:02.419]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[01:32:02.419 --> 01:32:03.280]  Spy on me?
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:03.600]  Yeah.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.647]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[01:32:08.647 --> 01:32:10.269]  You should use Startpage instead.
[01:32:10.269 --> 01:32:11.030]  Startpage?
[01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.451]  Yeah.
[01:32:11.451 --> 01:32:12.532]  Startpage.com.
[01:32:12.532 --> 01:32:15.316]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:19.357]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[01:32:19.357 --> 01:32:22.478]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[01:32:22.478 --> 01:32:25.098]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[01:32:25.098 --> 01:32:26.699]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[01:32:26.699 --> 01:32:26.999]  Right!
[01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:30.320]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.240]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.761]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:39.884]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week Startpage Challenge.
[01:32:39.884 --> 01:32:45.028]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to Startpage.com instead.
[01:32:45.028 --> 01:32:48.431]  Try seven days of Startpage and break the big brother habit.
[01:32:48.431 --> 01:32:50.192]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[01:32:50.192 --> 01:32:54.475]  Try Startpage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[01:32:54.475 --> 01:33:01.180]  That's Startpage.com.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.221]  Federal agents!
[01:33:02.221 --> 01:33:02.922]  We are armed!
[01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:12.493]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen with our live coverage of the G20.
[01:33:30.287 --> 01:33:33.989]  Bob Chapman for the next 30 minutes is going to be joining us, maybe a little bit longer.
[01:33:33.989 --> 01:33:40.593]  The International Forecaster as we break down the economic side of what's happening with the New World Order.
[01:33:40.593 --> 01:33:50.299]  But before we go to Bob Chapman, Jason Bermas in the protest, more than 2,000 people marching to the Convention Center from Pitt from the University.
[01:33:51.451 --> 01:34:05.043]  They have been using sound cannons yesterday, video after video of them attacking young women, sound cannoning nine-year-old, ten-year-old boys in their front yards, bizarre videos of armored vehicles with sound cannons.
[01:34:05.043 --> 01:34:08.346]  There's got to be dozens and dozens of these units.
[01:34:08.346 --> 01:34:15.132]  We've got videos of five or six sound cannons together at one intersection firing at people that actually can damage the middle ear.
[01:34:16.089 --> 01:34:22.852]  It bypasses the eardrums, goes right to the bones in your ear, vibrating them violently.
[01:34:22.852 --> 01:34:23.732]  Very, very painful.
[01:34:23.732 --> 01:34:25.933]  Sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:34:25.933 --> 01:34:28.875]  These are used in Iraq.
[01:34:28.875 --> 01:34:34.737]  Military police are getting out of cars, running up and snatching and grabbing people and cramming them into police cars.
[01:34:34.737 --> 01:34:39.659]  I mean, it is something out of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or Maoist China.
[01:34:39.659 --> 01:34:40.820]  This is all off the charts.
[01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:47.314]  The USA Today, Obama set stage for New World Order.
[01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:50.096]  Other papers reporting he's now President of the World.
[01:34:50.096 --> 01:34:56.201]  CNN reporting he's now chairing the true body that runs the UN, the 15-member Security Council that has all the power.
[01:34:56.201 --> 01:34:58.162]  The General Assembly has no power.
[01:34:58.162 --> 01:35:04.387]  One member of the Security Council can veto the other 180-plus members.
[01:35:04.387 --> 01:35:05.788]  All of this is happening.
[01:35:05.788 --> 01:35:11.292]  They're openly announcing to get rid of the dollar, a new global currency, which will just be cashless, and the private banks
[01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:14.533]  This new bank of the world will be the world government.
[01:35:14.533 --> 01:35:15.594]  They're now admitting that.
[01:35:15.594 --> 01:35:18.737]  They're going to pay a carbon tax to private banks, a Tobin tax.
[01:35:18.737 --> 01:35:22.021]  We're going to talk to Bob Chapman in one moment.
[01:35:22.021 --> 01:35:25.144]  Jason Bermas, InfoWars reporter, you'll be back live Sunday.
[01:35:26.098 --> 01:35:29.902]  Six to nine here, with your own show, giving your own first-hand account.
[01:35:29.902 --> 01:35:40.213]  We'll have incredible video, never before seen, of stuff from rooftops, of Luke Rodowski bullhorning them as they hit him with sound cannons, people fleeing, just off the charts.
[01:35:40.213 --> 01:35:42.035]  But anything else, Jason Burmess?
[01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:44.171]  Oh, not really, Alex.
[01:35:44.171 --> 01:35:48.274]  I just had a group of Mariah police pass me with a couple of dogs.
[01:35:48.274 --> 01:35:53.338]  They seem to be now in a formation following protesters down.
[01:35:53.338 --> 01:35:58.382]  I really can't think that far ahead of me whether or not they're going to be warding off the streets.
[01:35:58.382 --> 01:35:59.963]  We are approaching the city.
[01:35:59.963 --> 01:36:04.887]  I'd say we're probably one, maybe two miles away from the downtown area.
[01:36:04.887 --> 01:36:08.210]  Again, the downtown area has been nothing but restricted access.
[01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:09.731]  They have not let protesters in.
[01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:16.914]  I'm waiting to see, just along with the rest of us, what's going to happen when we get down there.
[01:36:16.914 --> 01:36:25.058]  Well, I'll tell you right now, these police officers are guarding the private bankers that are openly stealing them blind.
[01:36:25.058 --> 01:36:27.819]  $23.7 trillion stolen in the last 10 months.
[01:36:27.819 --> 01:36:30.361]  They are openly aiding and abetting treason.
[01:36:31.841 --> 01:36:35.663]  And they're destroying their own future, so they're going to punish themselves.
[01:36:35.663 --> 01:36:44.907]  The videos we've seen, Burmese, of them beating young women for no reason, hitting small children in neighborhoods, and you said you saw this yesterday.
[01:36:44.907 --> 01:36:59.935]  Jason Douglas confirmed, we need to get a headline up, that he saw them rolling through neighborhoods, hitting people on their front porches, announcing no one's even allowed outside their homes, they don't care what your business is, not even one person now can walk
[01:37:00.515 --> 01:37:01.675]  Clearly they're hurting you.
[01:37:01.675 --> 01:37:07.698]  They're going to block off the streets soon, block you in front, then the sides, then in back, and then attack you.
[01:37:07.698 --> 01:37:08.378]  Get out!
[01:37:08.378 --> 01:37:14.120]  As soon as you see them starting to close the net, get out so you can shoot video from the outside.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.340]  Jason Burmas, great job.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:16.861]  We salute your courage.
[01:37:16.861 --> 01:37:17.781]  Alright, thank you Alex.
[01:37:17.781 --> 01:37:19.422]  I'll call in later with a report if I have anything.
[01:37:19.938 --> 01:37:21.078]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:37:21.078 --> 01:37:27.480]  You know, I've been to more than 20 of these events over the years and filmed similar things happening, but never seen them use the sound cannons.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:40.724]  I saw them having them in New York and other places and running mopeds and horses into people and tear-gassing and rubber-bulleting and arresting innocent people and provocateurs and... I've had the military pull guns on us once in San Antonio.
[01:37:43.078 --> 01:37:48.739]  But I have never seen something of this magnitude going on.
[01:37:48.739 --> 01:38:01.221]  Let's go to Bob Chapman, former stockbroker, former gold broker, at one time ran the biggest private newsletter out there, came back out of retirement with the International Forecaster, also worked in military intelligence.
[01:38:01.221 --> 01:38:03.382]  Always great to have him on with us.
[01:38:03.382 --> 01:38:08.023]  We were off last Friday, so we skipped our meeting with him, but it's good to have him here.
[01:38:08.023 --> 01:38:09.643]  Bob, quite a momentous occasion.
[01:38:10.103 --> 01:38:10.864]  Well, it was expected.
[01:38:10.864 --> 01:38:13.906]  We didn't know when, but it was expected and it's happening.
[01:38:13.906 --> 01:38:15.727]  It's still going to take them a long time to try to implement this.
[01:38:15.727 --> 01:38:19.890]  They're going to get all kinds of heat from the American public and the public of other countries as well.
[01:38:40.749 --> 01:39:03.476]  And I think their pronouncements regarding cutting back on the amount of money in credit and the amount of money being issued by central banks to keep banks within their systems functioning, all of that is a smokescreen.
[01:39:03.476 --> 01:39:04.996]  They cannot cut back.
[01:39:04.996 --> 01:39:07.677]  If they cut back, the whole system collapses.
[01:39:08.968 --> 01:39:12.089]  It all depends on when they want to collapse the system, too.
[01:39:12.089 --> 01:39:19.533]  But I figure they'll try to keep it going for about a year and a half to two more years, and then I think they're going to pull the plug.
[01:39:19.533 --> 01:39:29.377]  And what I mean by that is they'll stop inundating the world economy with money and credit and shut it down.
[01:39:29.377 --> 01:39:32.619]  It will go into a deflationary depression.
[01:39:32.619 --> 01:39:37.221]  They'll probably accompany it by biological warfare against everybody in the world.
[01:39:38.161 --> 01:39:44.704]  And then I think they'll make their move for world government.
[01:39:44.704 --> 01:39:47.865]  Continue, Bob.
[01:39:47.865 --> 01:39:57.810]  I think that this meeting is really a facade for something more important that they've got planned down the road.
[01:39:57.810 --> 01:40:04.973]  They really didn't go deeply into anything except each country
[01:40:06.634 --> 01:40:07.195]  I don't
[01:40:30.239 --> 01:40:33.202]  They also want to tax it as well, incidentally.
[01:40:33.202 --> 01:40:41.829]  And they're openly announcing in Times of London, BBC, AP, Reuters, everything we've broken down they would do because we're reading their own documents for decades.
[01:40:41.829 --> 01:40:46.233]  It's no surprise, but for the public it is, who was denying what we were saying.
[01:40:46.233 --> 01:40:47.914]  But the very same private banks
[01:40:48.757 --> 01:40:49.698]  That's good to know.
[01:41:07.435 --> 01:41:12.419]  And the media is praising him saying, oh he admits America isn't powerful anymore.
[01:41:12.419 --> 01:41:25.989]  I mean, this is unbelievable treason, Bob, and to see him chair the UN Security Council, something no president would do before on the rotating council because it's unconstitutional, Article 1, Section 9.
[01:41:25.989 --> 01:41:28.311]  Speak to that.
[01:41:28.311 --> 01:41:33.455]  Well, you're absolutely right, but to these people the Constitution doesn't mean anything.
[01:41:34.053 --> 01:41:36.395]  They are the ultimate law.
[01:41:36.395 --> 01:41:38.337]  They do what they want to do.
[01:41:38.337 --> 01:41:42.300]  And they're going to continue to do that as long as we let them.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:49.106]  And that's why your program and programs like it and the publications such as the Forecaster are so important.
[01:41:49.106 --> 01:41:51.508]  And believe me, we discussed this before.
[01:41:51.508 --> 01:41:53.590]  We are reaching the public.
[01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:55.752]  They are waking up.
[01:41:55.752 --> 01:42:00.897]  And the military knows exactly what's going on at all of the medium to lower levels.
[01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:05.953]  They know what the government's pulling, what they're doing.
[01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:13.177]  You know, I have them on every week on one of the programs, and the information that comes in is incredible.
[01:42:13.177 --> 01:42:26.145]  In fact, we just got a heads up on, and I don't know if you've heard about this, but there were three ships which were out of San Diego, and one of them, I guess, off the coast of Spain.
[01:42:26.145 --> 01:42:27.766]  Yeah, it's in the Associated Press.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:29.701]  Right.
[01:42:29.701 --> 01:42:38.488]  But I've got the information from some of the wives of these people.
[01:42:38.488 --> 01:42:53.860]  And so it'll be in tomorrow's issue as to the fact that two of the senior officers of one of the ships died with this experiment that they pulled using American military people as guinea pigs.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.264]  Wait, are you saying Project Shad or something similar has been reignited?
[01:42:59.235 --> 01:43:00.715]  Yes.
[01:43:00.715 --> 01:43:09.197]  In fact, I will send you a copy of what I'm putting out as soon as we get off the program.
[01:43:09.197 --> 01:43:18.340]  I just sent a piece to Bill Deagle who had requested I send it to him when I get the information and I'll give it to you as soon as I get off the air.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.940]  I can't do it at this very moment.
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:23.841]  Is it okay if we link to it at that point or you want us to wait till tomorrow?
[01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:26.719]  No, you do anything you want.
[01:43:26.719 --> 01:43:28.320]  This is public information.
[01:43:43.675 --> 01:43:46.540]  I wanted to bring this up to you.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:54.832]  Classic MO like we've seen in all the other cases of where they provocateur some mentally ill person or it's an informant patsy they set up.
[01:43:55.973 --> 01:44:03.861]  They admit in Dallas and in Illinois they wanted to bomb a 60-story skyscraper in Dallas where I'm from, the big pyramid building.
[01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:18.095]  They wanted to bomb a federal building in Illinois and in each case it says the feds made a bomb where the person's commander, they thought their Al-Qaeda commander, gave it to them to go carry it out and these guys are both
[01:44:18.735 --> 01:44:43.608]  Out of prisons, which is where they always recruit them out of, and it's the same story every time, where they go, even CNN goes, oh yeah, the FBI went and found the guy, let him, gave him the truck bomb, what he thought was a truck bomb, gave him the other bomb, totally staged at the same time, now being blamed on Iran, as they openly say Iran now has hidden nukes, just like they said with Iraq, the WMDs that didn't exist, and that Israel may hit Iran.
[01:44:43.608 --> 01:44:44.268]  Can you speak to that?
[01:44:45.993 --> 01:44:57.876]  Well, it's all a fallacy as we know, and it's a setup, and they may be looking to attack Iran, finally.
[01:44:57.876 --> 01:45:13.941]  And they're using the same script, they're just changing the last letter from Iraq to Iran, a Q to an N. We've had a lot of experts and former CIA analysts on, they're saying if Iran is hit, any one of the three scenarios is going to be devastating.
[01:45:15.373 --> 01:45:22.516]  That's right, because I'm sure that Russia and then China will get involved on the other side.
[01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:24.857]  And it'll be nuclear warfare.
[01:45:24.857 --> 01:45:26.298]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[01:45:26.298 --> 01:45:37.243]  And all I can say to you is, listeners, go and look at some of the pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a few days after the bomb was dropped.
[01:45:37.243 --> 01:45:38.424]  You want to look at it.
[01:45:38.424 --> 01:45:40.345]  There was nothing left standing virtually.
[01:45:40.345 --> 01:45:42.666]  Well, I'll tell you why I believe it may have been green-lighted.
[01:45:43.786 --> 01:45:47.247]  Benjamin Netanyahu says it is.
[01:45:47.247 --> 01:45:53.248]  Medvedev, the puppet president of Russia, saying, oh, we're going to go ahead and put sanctions on Iran.
[01:45:53.248 --> 01:46:03.871]  This came two weeks after Netanyahu, Jerusalem Post reported, as well as Moscow Times, traveled to Moscow in a secret meeting to get the green light to hit him.
[01:46:03.871 --> 01:46:08.272]  And then suddenly Obama announced they're not going to do the missile system now.
[01:46:08.272 --> 01:46:11.333]  As a tit for tat, it looks like Russia may have gotten on board.
[01:46:12.944 --> 01:46:31.470]  It's possible, but I was told by my informants that they are now able to accomplish the same thing via submarine as they could have with the missile emplacements in Poland and the radar in Czechoslovakia.
[01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:41.233]  And I was told that Netanyahu was virtually thrown out of the office because he demanded that Russia stay out of it.
[01:46:42.464 --> 01:46:58.067]  If Israel went after Iran, and there was a big argument, and that's, you know, I have to treat it as rumor inasmuch as you never know how good intelligence is.
[01:46:58.067 --> 01:47:09.089]  I had that in the publication on Wednesday, I believe, but one of my people wrote in and I just actually published it the way it was.
[01:47:10.233 --> 01:47:17.118]  But, you know, it's hard to say here what they're going to do because there's so much misinformation.
[01:47:17.118 --> 01:47:19.379]  And there's so much information that we don't get.
[01:47:19.379 --> 01:47:21.961]  This is a big thing.
[01:47:21.961 --> 01:47:28.766]  I do know that they're planning on putting 500,000 troops and mercenaries in Afghanistan.
[01:47:28.766 --> 01:47:29.927]  And they've got about 160 now.
[01:47:32.529 --> 01:47:34.510]  Yes, that's now been leaked from the Pentagon.
[01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:35.770]  500,000 trips.
[01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:37.911]  Boy, what a piece of Nick Obama is.
[01:47:37.911 --> 01:47:39.192]  Let me shift gears here, Bob.
[01:47:39.192 --> 01:47:40.672]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:47:40.672 --> 01:47:41.752]  Microwave guns.
[01:47:41.752 --> 01:47:42.473]  We have video.
[01:47:42.473 --> 01:47:45.474]  We've been playing it, driving through neighborhoods.
[01:47:45.474 --> 01:47:46.474]  No one's even on the street.
[01:47:46.474 --> 01:47:48.655]  People are videotaping out their windows.
[01:47:48.655 --> 01:47:49.955]  And there's photos we've got.
[01:47:49.955 --> 01:47:51.156]  I was looking at it last night.
[01:47:51.156 --> 01:47:53.557]  Aaron's still asleep because he was up until 5 a.m., I'm told.
[01:47:53.557 --> 01:47:57.278]  I left at 2 after I was on coast-to-coast AM and did some work here.
[01:47:57.998 --> 01:48:09.382]  I should have printed that off, but it was photos and videos on his computer, I can go check during a break and try to find it, of like, little kids just walking down the street or in their front yard and no one's... and they got a ball!
[01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:10.843]  It's the classic shot!
[01:48:10.843 --> 01:48:13.483]  And here comes an armored vehicle hitting them with LRAD!
[01:48:13.483 --> 01:48:16.565]  I mean, this is... these cops are just mad dogs!
[01:48:16.565 --> 01:48:19.786]  Like, mad dogs that have tasted blood in a feeding frenzy!
[01:48:19.786 --> 01:48:21.746]  I mean, little kids are bad now?
[01:48:21.746 --> 01:48:23.807]  And because they're saying, no one's allowed on the streets!
[01:48:23.807 --> 01:48:24.247]  No one!
[01:48:24.247 --> 01:48:25.048]  Go in your houses!
[01:48:26.648 --> 01:48:28.569]  You know, hitting the... I mean, what is that, Bob?
[01:48:28.569 --> 01:48:33.911]  All I can tell them is we better start taking names.
[01:48:33.911 --> 01:48:38.073]  There's going to be retribution for stuff like that.
[01:48:38.073 --> 01:48:44.116]  But, I mean, why would police drive through neighborhoods where there are no protesters?
[01:48:44.116 --> 01:48:54.761]  You can see on the videos, the cameras panning, and the photos we've got of separate incidents, and you've got families on their front porches, and doing them, say they have this video, but they're too busy to try to upload it because they're running on the streets.
[01:48:55.481 --> 01:48:56.481]  Well, there's one or two reasons.
[01:48:56.481 --> 01:48:57.322]  They either want to stir up
[01:49:21.497 --> 01:49:32.126]  Well, I think it's like a bully likes to sit on top of you and spit in your face and punch you.
[01:49:32.126 --> 01:49:34.969]  And I just think it's, you know, they've been told, let them know they're serfs.
[01:49:34.969 --> 01:49:36.350]  Let them know you're in charge.
[01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:41.375]  They admit the black uniforms and masks are for intimidation.
[01:49:41.375 --> 01:49:42.396]  Well, that's true.
[01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:50.798]  But how can a real man, and I'm not saying I'm some tough guy or something, but I would be ashamed of messing with weak people.
[01:49:50.798 --> 01:49:58.865]  You know, I mean, I don't, I would be ashamed, my instincts are leave weak people alone, but boy, some big guy starts something with me, I mean, that gets me fired up.
[01:49:58.865 --> 01:50:01.548]  Like, I mean, isn't that how you're supposed to be?
[01:50:01.548 --> 01:50:07.153]  That a warrior wants to fight other warriors, not go around messing with nine-year-old kids and 95-pound women?
[01:50:09.216 --> 01:50:13.480]  Absolutely, and you're right, that's normality.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.543]  That's the way normal people would react to that.
[01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:23.029]  And people will pick on children and families that are non-combatants, if you want.
[01:50:23.029 --> 01:50:31.097]  They're either demented or they're trying to get these people to start shooting at them or something.
[01:50:31.097 --> 01:50:32.858]  Well, they're out of their minds is what they are.
[01:50:32.858 --> 01:50:34.200]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:38.985]  Amazing.
[01:50:38.985 --> 01:50:40.787]  By the way, Dave Mustaine is on.
[01:50:40.787 --> 01:50:43.668]  Rob is the producer that handled that.
[01:50:43.668 --> 01:50:45.690]  He left town on short notice.
[01:50:45.690 --> 01:50:48.992]  Didn't get Dave Mustaine's home number.
[01:50:48.992 --> 01:50:49.672]  He's at right now.
[01:50:49.672 --> 01:50:50.312]  He's obvious.
[01:50:50.312 --> 01:50:51.793]  And so we've got that now.
[01:50:51.793 --> 01:50:53.014]  Dave Mustaine is coming up.
[01:50:53.014 --> 01:50:54.155]  Start of the next hour.
[01:50:54.155 --> 01:50:57.077]  Final segment with Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster.
[01:50:57.077 --> 01:50:57.617]  Straight ahead.
[01:50:57.617 --> 01:51:01.279]  You don't want to miss this.
[01:51:01.279 --> 01:51:02.600]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.994]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:51:06.994 --> 01:51:08.335]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:08.335 --> 01:51:10.317]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:10.317 --> 01:51:17.344]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:51:17.344 --> 01:51:25.893]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:51:26.263 --> 01:51:33.346]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:51:33.346 --> 01:51:36.507]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:51:36.507 --> 01:51:42.289]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[01:53:03.999 --> 01:53:06.681]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.

[01:55:25.837 --> 01:55:34.205]  I don't know what your schedule is today, but I want to finish up with you on where the economy's going, what the G20 is doing from your analysis.
[01:55:34.205 --> 01:55:37.548]  You want to come up with us in about an hour and a half again for another 30?

[01:55:40.792 --> 01:55:41.793]  No, I can come back.
[01:55:41.793 --> 01:55:43.835]  I'm free in an hour and a half.
[01:55:44.855 --> 01:55:45.916]  An hour and a half, my friend.
[01:55:45.916 --> 01:55:51.800]  We're going to get a report at the start of the hour from my guys at the G20.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:58.644]  The timing should be it's going to get hot and heavy by then, my little nose tells me, but they'll be popping in.
[01:55:58.644 --> 01:56:01.046]  But yes, I'd like to have you the last 30 minutes of the show.
[01:56:01.046 --> 01:56:04.088]  T-minus one hour, 30 minutes from now, my friend.
[01:56:04.088 --> 01:56:12.194]  Okay, and Judy just sent you the information on those ships and the casualties on your email, which starts wave two.
[01:56:13.809 --> 01:56:14.469]  Okay, good.
[01:56:14.469 --> 01:56:16.770]  We will have it now.

[01:56:29.054 --> 01:56:30.214]  Bye-bye.
[01:56:30.214 --> 01:56:33.435]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I did want to spend some time here
[01:56:35.353 --> 01:56:40.515]  Today, telling you about the new film we're carrying that I'm in and that I also consulted on.

[01:56:41.495 --> 01:56:43.136]  It's discounted out of the gates.

[01:57:17.067 --> 01:57:19.668]  We just want to get the information out to people.
[01:57:19.668 --> 01:57:21.749]  That's all available at InfoWars.com.

[01:58:29.648 --> 01:58:32.190]  Founder and lead guitarist of Magadeth.
[01:58:32.190 --> 01:58:35.934]  Joining us straight ahead about his new album, Endgame.
[01:58:35.934 --> 01:58:38.877]  It's got the FEMA coffins on the cover to give you an idea of what it's about.
[01:58:38.877 --> 01:58:45.623]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:50.657 --> 01:58:54.901]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.901 --> 01:58:56.903]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.903 --> 01:59:05.432]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.432 --> 01:59:10.997]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.997 --> 01:59:12.619]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.839 --> 01:59:19.341]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.341 --> 01:59:30.403]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.403 --> 01:59:31.164]  That's right.

[02:00:06.673 --> 02:00:08.434]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:10.195]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.195 --> 02:00:11.776]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.776 --> 02:00:13.357]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.357 --> 02:00:17.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:21.583]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.024 --> 02:00:27.965]  We are going to continue to cover the G20.
[02:00:27.965 --> 02:00:30.225]  Open world government being announced.
[02:00:30.225 --> 02:00:32.606]  Barack Obama is the first U.S.
[02:00:32.606 --> 02:00:37.848]  President to sit as the Chairman of the United Nations Security Council.
[02:00:37.848 --> 02:00:41.729]  The 15-member, that's the only group that can really vote and has power.
[02:00:41.729 --> 02:00:44.450]  The General Assembly has no power.
[02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:46.950]  CNN called him President of the World.
[02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:50.231]  And he was shaking when he gaveled it in two days ago.
[02:00:50.231 --> 02:00:52.572]  Shaking with pleasure.
[02:00:52.572 --> 02:00:52.892]  U.S.
[02:00:52.892 --> 02:00:55.213]  Ambassador Rice behind him was shaking.
[02:00:56.273 --> 02:00:58.594]  Henry Kissinger was shaking in the audience.
[02:00:58.594 --> 02:01:04.776]  This is the New World Order, the Eugenics World Government, now coming into fruition.
[02:01:04.776 --> 02:01:10.477]  We are joined by Dave Mustaine, the founder and lead guitarist and lead singer of Megadeth.
[02:01:10.477 --> 02:01:13.178]  Guitarist, lead singer of Megadeth, Megadeth.com.
[02:01:13.178 --> 02:01:19.740]  The new album is in game, and I just want to say that growing up, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 today, I have always loved Megadeth because the lyrics
[02:01:25.765 --> 02:01:37.408]  I didn't even really understand him when I was 12, 14, 15 years old, 20 years old, but then as I learned about the new world order, the eugenics, the master plan, it really did influence me and I didn't even realize how much it did.
[02:01:37.408 --> 02:01:40.749]  A man way before his time understanding what was coming.
[02:01:40.749 --> 02:01:44.811]  Most of their covers are about the UN and world government, and now it's all happening.
[02:01:44.811 --> 02:01:46.111]  Dave Mustaine, joining us.
[02:01:46.111 --> 02:01:47.451]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:49.492]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:01:49.492 --> 02:01:50.952]  What do you think about what's happening?
[02:01:50.952 --> 02:01:52.493]  World government being announced.
[02:01:53.266 --> 02:01:54.407]  It's pretty frightening.
[02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:55.007]  It's pretty frightening.
[02:01:55.007 --> 02:02:08.075]  I have to be really careful when I do my interviews and talk about a lot of stuff because, you know, you have to be objective and you have to give people the right to think out of the box, but I think you and I agree on a lot of things.
[02:02:08.075 --> 02:02:15.540]  And especially, I want to tell you thanks for inspiring me to look into the whole Endgame film and
[02:02:16.298 --> 02:02:33.184]  And I actually had discovered this document through watching an inspirational video, and then, you know, I know we'd spoken before, and that was a privilege for me, because I believe you're a patriot, and I think that our country needs more people like you.
[02:02:33.184 --> 02:02:42.187]  And as far as having our record called in game, you know, I think the best way to thank somebody is to, you know,
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.881]  Great credit where credit's due, so thanks.
[02:02:45.881 --> 02:02:46.821]  Almost.
[02:02:46.821 --> 02:02:48.602]  Now we just need one big boom.
[02:03:03.305 --> 02:03:09.429]  Well, I tell ya, I mean, my wife is freaked out because she researches all this and she says, it's happening.
[02:03:09.429 --> 02:03:13.831]  It's world government, world taxes, world carbon taxes.
[02:03:13.831 --> 02:03:25.158]  We're gonna go to break in a moment and some stations join us, but Dave, tell us about the new record that's already, from what I've seen in the news, exploding up the charts in-game.
[02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:31.251]  Well, the new record we have recorded in a studio that I own in San Marcos, California.
[02:03:31.251 --> 02:03:39.100]  I moved back to San Diego after the lawsuit with Ellis, and I just didn't want to be in the same city with him, so we moved.
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:45.807]  And then when I started doing this record, of course, I have a real free world kind of thinking.
[02:03:46.501 --> 02:03:56.263]  With my lyrics and stuff, so it was just going to be more of the same with this record, just continuing my idea to raise awareness and to help people think.
[02:03:56.263 --> 02:04:02.024]  I may not be right, but I'm certainly right to inspire people to question.
[02:04:02.024 --> 02:04:07.105]  And this record has a lot of topics, and it talks about the collapse of the financial institutions.
[02:04:07.105 --> 02:04:12.146]  You know, I went to school and I got licensed by the state and federal government to work on Wall Street as a stockbroker.
[02:04:12.931 --> 02:04:21.298]  I figured being in the music business, most people in the music business aren't very smart when it comes to their money, so I wanted to be smart and educate myself about that.
[02:04:21.298 --> 02:04:23.420]  And along the way, you learn so much.
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:26.643]  The more that you're willing to exercise your brain, the more that
[02:04:27.307 --> 02:04:29.388]  Dave, we've got a break.
[02:04:29.388 --> 02:04:30.249]  We've got a break.
[02:04:30.249 --> 02:04:31.790]  The satellite makes us break.
[02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:32.530]  Stay right there.
[02:04:32.530 --> 02:04:36.552]  We'll be right back with Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth.
[02:04:36.552 --> 02:04:36.973]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:03.908]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.908 --> 02:05:07.530]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.530 --> 02:05:12.112]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.112 --> 02:05:17.695]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:17.995 --> 02:05:22.759]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.759 --> 02:05:26.381]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.381 --> 02:05:31.205]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.205 --> 02:05:37.769]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.769 --> 02:05:39.711]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.211 --> 02:05:43.413]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.413 --> 02:05:47.897]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.897 --> 02:05:50.118]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.118 --> 02:05:50.419]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.419 --> 02:05:51.139]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:08.435]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.435 --> 02:06:14.543]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[02:06:14.543 --> 02:06:17.186]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.486 --> 02:06:23.770]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.770 --> 02:06:27.833]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.833 --> 02:06:33.196]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.436 --> 02:06:35.517]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.517 --> 02:06:37.277]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.277 --> 02:06:39.798]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.798 --> 02:06:44.540]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:48.241]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.241 --> 02:06:51.362]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:51.362 --> 02:06:53.263]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:53.263 --> 02:06:55.364]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:07:00.899 --> 02:07:03.901]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:09.246]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.246 --> 02:07:11.287]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.287 --> 02:07:16.291]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:17.212]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.472 --> 02:07:18.593]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.593 --> 02:07:20.474]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.474 --> 02:07:21.555]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.555 --> 02:07:23.756]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.756 --> 02:07:25.097]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.097 --> 02:07:26.618]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.618 --> 02:07:31.881]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.881 --> 02:07:35.484]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.484 --> 02:07:38.946]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.286 --> 02:07:40.507]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.507 --> 02:07:41.428]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.428 --> 02:07:42.509]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.509 --> 02:07:43.450]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:44.551]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.551 --> 02:07:47.594]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.594 --> 02:07:49.376]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.376 --> 02:07:50.297]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:56.532 --> 02:09:05.735]  I'm going to start headbanging here in a minute!
[02:09:05.735 --> 02:09:12.236]  Dave, I listened to that song, what did that come out in the early 1990s?
[02:09:12.236 --> 02:09:13.997]  Yeah, that was Countdown to Extinction.
[02:09:26.172 --> 02:09:29.915]  Now you watch as the President is the head of the U.N.
[02:09:29.915 --> 02:09:34.037]  Security Council and the President, and they're openly announcing world government.
[02:09:34.037 --> 02:09:39.961]  How did you know all of this 15 years ago?
[02:09:39.961 --> 02:09:41.722]  I don't know.
[02:09:41.722 --> 02:09:43.323]  You're a lucky guess, maybe.
[02:09:43.323 --> 02:09:54.831]  Paying attention to the news, listening to people like yourself, other people who are thinking for themselves, and they're not being led off to slaughter like mindless sheep.
[02:09:57.054 --> 02:09:57.874]  Amazing.
[02:09:57.874 --> 02:09:59.055]  Some stations just joined us.
[02:09:59.055 --> 02:10:02.336]  Dave Mustaine, the founder and guitarist and lead singer of Megadeth.
[02:10:02.336 --> 02:10:03.997]  Megadeth.com is the website.
[02:10:03.997 --> 02:10:06.819]  A lot about the band, what's happening, what's going on.
[02:10:06.819 --> 02:10:08.059]  But you got interrupted by the break.
[02:10:08.059 --> 02:10:14.822]  Let's get back into what influenced your new, very popular, out-of-the-gates, just-released album, Endgame.
[02:10:14.822 --> 02:10:19.604]  And you were getting into how they try to call us conspiracy theorists, but it's all now being announced.
[02:10:19.604 --> 02:10:20.005]  Dave Mustaine.
[02:10:20.885 --> 02:10:27.668]  It's really easy for people, whenever you talk about things that are controversial in nature, for people to sit on the sidelines and point their fingers.
[02:10:27.668 --> 02:10:42.296]  So, when anybody says anything that's controversial in nature, especially stuff that has to do with our government or any of the administration, whether they say it's anti-patriotic, or they say that you're just a nutjob, and to be even more insulting.
[02:10:42.916 --> 02:10:51.792]  You know, our nation was founded on people who think outside of the box, people who questioned authority, people who looked at things and said, you know, I don't agree with this.
[02:10:53.609 --> 02:10:54.989]  Well, it certainly was.
[02:10:54.989 --> 02:10:58.450]  The cover of Endgame, a lot of people have emailed me saying, what is it?
[02:10:58.450 --> 02:10:59.690]  And I go, well, it's totally clear.
[02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:07.112]  It's a bunch of, and tell me if I'm wrong, like zombie slaves in concentration camp uniforms being marched off towards a pyramidal light.
[02:11:07.112 --> 02:11:15.594]  And there's stacks of the FEMA coffins that have been deployed all over the country at depots.
[02:11:15.594 --> 02:11:20.355]  And there's a bunch of flies basically feeding on the death surrounding it.
[02:11:20.355 --> 02:11:22.195]  Is that an accurate breakdown of the cover?
[02:11:22.535 --> 02:11:24.978]  That's really, really, really close.
[02:11:24.978 --> 02:11:26.660]  Everything that you said is accurate.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:31.325]  There's a little bit more symbology there that you might not have noticed.
[02:11:31.325 --> 02:11:40.316]  A lot of the biblical stuff, like with the parting of the Red Sea and the people going through, there's also the barcode that's on their heads.
[02:11:40.316 --> 02:11:43.179]  If you look closely inside of the
[02:11:43.803 --> 02:11:50.527]  Album cover has the larger picture, but if you look closely on the cover, there's what appears to be a mohawk going up the back of his guy's head.
[02:11:50.527 --> 02:11:51.468]  That's not what it is.
[02:11:51.468 --> 02:12:02.354]  When you get inside of the cover and you look at it, it's the barcode, because, you know, they say nothing can be bought or sold without the mark, and it's going to be on your forehead, but nobody said it's going to go, you know, left to right.
[02:12:02.354 --> 02:12:04.556]  How about if it's, you know, fashionable, like a mohawk?
[02:12:04.556 --> 02:12:12.661]  And then the thing with the flies on the outside and the way that they're just waving, that was one of the plagues.
[02:12:15.202 --> 02:12:18.764]  One of the biblical plagues, and I see it.
[02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:20.965]  They've got barcodes on the backs of their heads.
[02:12:20.965 --> 02:12:27.049]  They're in Gitmo orange jumpsuits marching in what looks like a mass grave.
[02:12:27.049 --> 02:12:31.151]  And they're going through the Red Sea of those black FEMA coffins.
[02:12:31.151 --> 02:12:33.753]  Those are the walls of the black sea being held back.
[02:12:36.817 --> 02:12:51.571]  Well, there you have it from Dave Mustaine, and am I right to say that it kind of nexuses at a paramount point, like the eye of Lucifer or the eye of Satan that is energizing this scene?
[02:12:51.571 --> 02:12:53.713]  Well, that's pretty heavy.
[02:12:53.713 --> 02:12:58.217]  No, I didn't go that deep with that particular part of it.
[02:12:58.217 --> 02:13:02.461]  There is a light that they're heading to at the end, but it was more kind of like a
[02:13:03.035 --> 02:13:03.335]  I don't know.
[02:13:23.138 --> 02:13:23.939]  Absolutely.
[02:13:23.939 --> 02:13:25.481]  Wow, what a heavy cover.
[02:13:25.481 --> 02:13:36.716]  And I've seen, you know, doing some research for this interview, and also checking the album out, all these people speculating what it is, and I looked at it immediately and said, yeah, those are people marching to their death.
[02:13:39.625 --> 02:13:40.985]  Amazing.
[02:13:40.985 --> 02:13:44.606]  Tell us about some of the songs in the album.
[02:13:44.606 --> 02:13:49.447]  Okay, the album starts off with a classic guitar duel.
[02:13:49.447 --> 02:13:54.228]  I think a lot of your listeners will really dig the lyrics on this record, but there's also a lot of great guitar work.
[02:13:54.228 --> 02:13:59.269]  Guitar players have become very sophisticated because of heavy metal in America.
[02:13:59.269 --> 02:14:04.530]  It peaked in the 90s when all the hair bands came out and it lost its integrity to a lot of people.
[02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:08.300]  And it went underground and now it's making a resurgence.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:11.063]  They came to a period where they weren't even doing guitar solos.
[02:14:11.063 --> 02:14:14.907]  This guitar, this record is full of guitar solos.
[02:14:14.907 --> 02:14:23.955]  And we start off with an instrumental that's just, you know, lobbying guitar solos back and forth to each other, or volleying them back and forth with me and the other guitar player.
[02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:28.460]  And the next song is called This Day We Fight, which is influenced by the
[02:14:29.079 --> 02:14:35.012]  The war speech that Aragon gave in whatever his name was in Lord of the Rings.
[02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:42.674]  You know, saying that, hey man, we may die tomorrow, but we're not going to die today, because this day we're going to fight, and we're going to kick butt, and we're going to take down names.
[02:14:42.674 --> 02:14:43.975]  And that's how it's been for us.
[02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:48.318]  You know, we've really had to fight an uphill battle, but it really seems like the worm's turn.
[02:14:48.318 --> 02:14:59.667]  Websites like Blabbermouth that have hated me since the day that they started gave us some 8.5 on our new record, and they said that it's time for them to pay attention to Professor Dave, and I'm thinking,
[02:15:00.419 --> 02:15:01.480]  What?
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:08.643]  You know, this is a website that whenever I would say anything, they would post a story about it and slam me.
[02:15:08.643 --> 02:15:18.829]  So it's amazing the way that everything is turned around right now for us, for me, for just sticking to my guns too, because there was a period where a lot of heavy metal bands reinvented themselves.
[02:15:19.809 --> 02:15:26.252]  Then we go into different songs, like 1320 is a song about drag racing, and the National Hot Rod Association loves the song.
[02:15:26.252 --> 02:15:32.595]  We've got a song called 44 Minutes, which is about the North Hollywood bank robbery that happened back in the 90s.
[02:15:32.595 --> 02:15:41.679]  And then of course the title track, which is about the document that I discovered that our former president had signed.
[02:15:41.679 --> 02:15:45.821]  It was brought to my attention by searching the web, knowing who you are,
[02:15:46.958 --> 02:15:52.422]  And also seeing the part that you posted about Lou Dobbs, because I really respect that guy.
[02:15:52.422 --> 02:15:55.565]  And I thought, you know, there's just something really wrong about this.
[02:15:55.565 --> 02:15:57.606]  And I looked into it and I thought, that's it.
[02:15:57.606 --> 02:16:00.549]  I'm going to sing a song about this because it's perfect.
[02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:08.275]  It completely predicts... Because I read 1984 when I was just a kid, and I've got so many songs about this, like hook and bounces about that.
[02:16:08.275 --> 02:16:14.120]  There's just a whole bunch of stuff that talks about this future world that we're just blindly marching into.
[02:16:16.351 --> 02:16:18.752]  Well, we certainly are blindly marching in.
[02:16:18.752 --> 02:16:29.674]  We have video and photos of neighborhoods with no one even protesting, with the Pittsburgh police in Pennsylvania saying for the G20, no one's allowed to congregate, no one's allowed to be on the street.
[02:16:29.674 --> 02:16:31.094]  They say, flee!
[02:16:31.094 --> 02:16:31.395]  Flee!
[02:16:31.395 --> 02:16:33.875]  And then they turn on the sound cannons.
[02:16:33.875 --> 02:16:35.395]  They hit my employees with it.
[02:16:35.395 --> 02:16:39.857]  We've got video of them walking up to women and Billy clubbing them in the head.
[02:16:39.857 --> 02:16:41.497]  Video... Pardon me?
[02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:44.669]  Oh no, it's incredible.
[02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:57.455]  We've got video, and we'll place them in the background for people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, not just on the radio, of the military pulling up and grabbing peaceful protesters, snatching and grabbing, cramming them into unmarked police cars.
[02:16:57.455 --> 02:16:58.835]  The military!
[02:16:58.835 --> 02:17:05.278]  I mean, so they're not only announcing the world government and the world tax, and Obama is now a dual president in the U.N.
[02:17:05.278 --> 02:17:06.878]  and the U.S.
[02:17:06.878 --> 02:17:12.921]  as the chairman of the Security Council, but now the military's... I mean, it's like they want us to know
[02:17:13.661 --> 02:17:15.963]  That they're in control?
[02:17:15.963 --> 02:17:19.466]  Yeah, I think so, huh?
[02:17:19.466 --> 02:17:20.867]  Wow.
[02:17:20.867 --> 02:17:22.989]  That's so sad.
[02:17:22.989 --> 02:17:25.451]  I guess you take a mortal man, you put him in control.
[02:17:25.451 --> 02:17:26.952]  Watch him become a god.
[02:17:26.952 --> 02:17:29.154]  That's right.
[02:17:29.154 --> 02:17:32.357]  And these things, you know, I've been talking about them forever.
[02:17:32.357 --> 02:17:35.279]  As long as I can write music, I've been talking about stuff like this.
[02:17:35.279 --> 02:17:37.081]  It didn't really get to a point where people would
[02:17:37.850 --> 02:17:40.231]  You don't really take anything that I said seriously.
[02:17:40.231 --> 02:17:46.312]  I mean, imagine what it's like for these poor guys that sing songs about dragons.
[02:17:46.312 --> 02:17:47.013]  Well, exactly.
[02:17:47.013 --> 02:17:54.195]  But I mean, again, I've gone over the years and read your lyrics again, and it just rung true when I was 20 years ago.
[02:17:54.195 --> 02:17:57.356]  I mean, I've been listening to Megadeth since it started when I was about 12.
[02:17:58.795 --> 02:18:27.192]  and uh... when you started it uh... and and and i was like i don't know if it was always probably my favorite if not my favorite uh... you heavy metal they like the speed mail and everything on the mix in the different and i like the fact that you're not fake you've never changed i mean expanded and and grown but but it's never change you're not changing your hairstyle or acting silly or or trying to you know this is yet i mean you're doing what you want to do being authentic and i think that really
[02:18:28.197 --> 02:18:30.798]  Underlines what you've done with Megadeth.
[02:18:30.798 --> 02:18:37.401]  Well, I think that's a very American way to be true to yourself and stand up for what you believe in.
[02:18:37.401 --> 02:18:46.584]  It's hard for people to really stand up for what they believe in anymore because if you do something like that, they'll vilify you.
[02:18:46.584 --> 02:18:49.285]  If you're doing anything that isn't status quo.
[02:18:50.942 --> 02:18:59.505]  Yeah, it was hard in the very beginning to be open about my life, the problems I had, and to be open about, you know, the band and problems we had.
[02:18:59.505 --> 02:19:03.326]  And, you know, people were not responding to that very well.
[02:19:03.326 --> 02:19:08.447]  But now, at this point, I can always say that, you know, I've been sincere since the beginning.
[02:19:08.447 --> 02:19:20.311]  You see these other guys that do these image makeovers and go from one band where they're dressed like, you know, they're the big fun man for Change Addiction, and then the next band they're in, they're, you know, in some, like, biker band.
[02:19:21.031 --> 02:19:24.714]  And it's like, how can you convince, how can you sell that?
[02:19:24.714 --> 02:19:28.196]  How can you convince your fans of the following?
[02:19:28.196 --> 02:19:37.262]  That one day you can be an androgynous space queen and the next day you can be, you know, the spawn of the big red machine, you know?
[02:19:37.262 --> 02:19:43.286]  Well, again, you have been anti-New World Order, anti-global government.
[02:19:43.286 --> 02:19:44.367]  How long has Megadeth been around?
[02:19:44.367 --> 02:19:44.647]  21 years?
[02:19:44.647 --> 02:19:44.827]  Longer?
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:49.485]  Yeah, it's been close to 25 years.
[02:19:49.485 --> 02:19:55.115]  When we started, it took a little time until we got the first lineup and went into the studio to record.
[02:19:55.115 --> 02:19:55.515]  That happened.
[02:19:55.515 --> 02:19:56.156]  Stay there, Dave.
[02:19:56.156 --> 02:19:56.797]  Gotta break again.
[02:19:56.797 --> 02:19:57.639]  Sorry to cut you off.
[02:19:57.639 --> 02:19:58.340]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:19:58.721]  Amazing.
[02:19:58.721 --> 02:19:59.241]  Dave Mustaine.
[02:20:01.425 --> 02:20:03.467]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[02:20:03.467 --> 02:20:06.411]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[02:20:06.411 --> 02:20:08.653]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[02:20:08.653 --> 02:20:09.634]  Here's the story.
[02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:14.440]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:15.681]  Now here's the bad news.
[02:20:15.681 --> 02:20:18.885]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[02:20:19.085 --> 02:20:19.526]  We're good to go.
[02:20:35.183 --> 02:20:44.191]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[02:20:44.191 --> 02:20:49.375]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[02:20:49.375 --> 02:20:53.499]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[02:20:53.499 --> 02:20:56.261]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.303 --> 02:21:05.213]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:21:05.213 --> 02:21:08.742]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:21:13.567 --> 02:21:14.247]  We're good to go.
[02:21:34.381 --> 02:21:38.543]  Midas Resources will send you a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:21:38.543 --> 02:21:39.864]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:39.864 --> 02:21:46.047]  Get the fax and call Midas Resources toll free at 888-292-2709.

[02:21:48.948 --> 02:21:54.311]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:22:01.496 --> 02:22:08.258]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:08.258 --> 02:22:10.899]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:10.899 --> 02:22:12.459]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:12.459 --> 02:22:13.260]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:14.160]  This is his ammo.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:15.620]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:17.601]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:17.601 --> 02:22:24.763]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:24.763 --> 02:22:25.243]  Some U.S.
[02:22:25.243 --> 02:22:30.885]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:31.585 --> 02:22:35.106]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:35.106 --> 02:22:37.886]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:01.451 --> 02:23:04.833]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:23:04.833 --> 02:23:08.735]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:23:08.735 --> 02:23:12.456]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:23:12.456 --> 02:23:19.940]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:20.240]  I think so.
[02:23:45.698 --> 02:23:48.659]  And, ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[02:24:05.707 --> 02:24:09.849]  Order to report to their district detention centers.
[02:24:09.849 --> 02:24:11.710]  Do not return to your homes.
[02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:12.670]  Do not contact anyone.
[02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:15.931]  Do not use any cellular or GPS devices.
[02:24:15.931 --> 02:24:17.952]  Surrender all weapons at once.
[02:24:17.952 --> 02:24:18.532]  Attention!
[02:24:18.532 --> 02:24:21.294]  This way to the caves.
[02:24:21.294 --> 02:24:22.114]  I woke up!
[02:24:53.616 --> 02:24:55.219]  We're good.
[02:25:27.519 --> 02:25:28.500]  Wake up, people!
[02:25:55.914 --> 02:25:57.375]  Unbelievable!
[02:25:57.375 --> 02:25:57.955]  Unbelievable!
[02:25:57.955 --> 02:26:02.117]  Hear the whole song, the whole album, at Megadeth.com.
[02:26:02.117 --> 02:26:12.842]  M-E-G-A-D-E-T-H dot com, or just Google Megadeth, the term endgame, get it at iTunes, get the CD, get it all at Megadeth.com.
[02:26:12.842 --> 02:26:14.963]  We need to support this type of message.
[02:26:14.963 --> 02:26:18.845]  Megadeth is up there at the very top of heavy metal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:19.585 --> 02:26:22.187]  And these folks have packed stadiums across the planet.
[02:26:22.187 --> 02:26:26.811]  We need this anti-New World Order message now more than ever to warn people.
[02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:31.656]  Whatever's going to happen with the New World Order, whatever this global system's going to do, we have to stand and resist it.
[02:26:31.656 --> 02:26:36.820]  And the clergy response teams have been hired by the feds to tell their flocks to not stand up and not resist.
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:38.402]  They're going to be raptured out.
[02:26:38.402 --> 02:26:39.222]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:26:40.271 --> 02:26:41.652]  That is unbelievable.
[02:26:41.652 --> 02:26:48.155]  Dave Mustaine, I tell you, every time I hear that song since it came out last week, it just blows me away and the lyrics just get even more hard-hitting.
[02:26:48.155 --> 02:26:58.980]  The RFID, the New World Order, the President, and then we played in the first hour audio of armored vehicles with sound cannons saying almost the same thing you've got in that intro.
[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:03.422]  I mean, talk about unbelievable!
[02:27:03.422 --> 02:27:04.663]  Well, I'm a real American.
[02:27:05.868 --> 02:27:26.118]  Hell yeah you are, and let me tell you, tens of millions of Megadeth fans worldwide are now going to finally understand, they're always, why does he have the UN on the cover of his, and you say my film Endgame influenced your album Endgame, this cover that I designed, I told the graphics person what to make, was influenced by a Megadeth cover.
[02:27:26.118 --> 02:27:32.441]  Did you notice that when you saw the Endgame DVD cover, that it was similar to that one where you have the UN and the flagless flagpoles?
[02:27:33.141 --> 02:27:33.981]  You know what?
[02:27:33.981 --> 02:27:35.442]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[02:27:35.442 --> 02:27:36.702]  I never saw the correlation.
[02:27:36.702 --> 02:27:38.242]  That's amazing.
[02:27:38.242 --> 02:27:41.563]  But it's just crazy that you influence me and I'm influencing you.
[02:27:41.563 --> 02:27:47.385]  Well, that's what I believe good ideas when people share stuff like that.
[02:27:47.385 --> 02:27:56.608]  It's a grassroots kind of thing and people, they benefit from it in a huge way when they share the truth.
[02:27:56.608 --> 02:27:57.928]  Because the truth is undeniable.
[02:27:59.474 --> 02:28:01.235]  In fact, that was from Peace Sells.
[02:28:01.235 --> 02:28:03.976]  Peace Sells, but who's buying?
[02:28:03.976 --> 02:28:07.097]  That's awesome!
[02:28:07.097 --> 02:28:09.318]  That was actually something that I saw.
[02:28:09.318 --> 02:28:14.721]  I got that song title from a Reader's Digest magazine.
[02:28:14.721 --> 02:28:20.444]  I was living with this girl and she went to work and I was a lazy musician, so I stayed back at her place.
[02:28:22.268 --> 02:28:24.169]  Um, there was the Reader's Digest there.
[02:28:24.169 --> 02:28:29.850]  That's why I make fun of the magazine and the song Sweating Bullets, why I say, nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest.
[02:28:29.850 --> 02:28:35.812]  Well, yeah, because I actually read that magazine for a little while after I got the lyric, I mean the title for it.
[02:28:35.812 --> 02:28:38.153]  He sells out of it.
[02:28:38.153 --> 02:28:42.574]  Interesting little book, but not something that's really modern anymore, I guess.
[02:28:42.574 --> 02:28:45.275]  What did you think of my film, Endgame itself, specifically?
[02:28:45.275 --> 02:28:45.855]  I loved it.
[02:28:45.855 --> 02:28:46.895]  I thought it was great.
[02:28:46.895 --> 02:28:50.377]  I mean, you're very brave to go and get in the face of people like this.
[02:28:50.377 --> 02:28:51.717]  I guess we all have our calling.
[02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:53.890]  Dave, we're about to break in a minute.
[02:28:53.890 --> 02:28:55.091]  Long segment coming up.
[02:28:55.091 --> 02:28:58.591]  In fact, we'll probably pull up P-Cells and play some of that, but some of the new album as well.
[02:28:58.591 --> 02:29:05.453]  How the folks, what's the best way, where's the best place to get your new album in-game and to support what you're doing?
[02:29:05.453 --> 02:29:09.834]  Well, I would say through Amazon or through iTunes.
[02:29:09.834 --> 02:29:14.336]  You know, you can listen to the music in many, many places right now.
[02:29:14.336 --> 02:29:16.116]  MySpace and iTunes really supported us.
[02:29:16.116 --> 02:29:19.917]  AOLmusic.com has supported us too with this record.
[02:29:20.459 --> 02:29:21.580]  And Amazon.
[02:29:21.580 --> 02:29:26.606]  It's the number one record at Amazon right now, and it's been that way for quite a few days.
[02:29:26.606 --> 02:29:28.028]  Number one!
[02:29:28.028 --> 02:29:31.292]  Endgame was number one for a few days on DVD.
[02:29:31.292 --> 02:29:31.732]  My film.
[02:29:31.732 --> 02:29:32.933]  But I tell you, that is incredible.
[02:29:32.933 --> 02:29:33.794]  Dave, we're going to break again.
[02:29:33.794 --> 02:29:35.977]  I want to come back and talk more about the album.
[02:29:35.977 --> 02:29:37.338]  I should have mentioned that.
[02:29:37.338 --> 02:29:38.460]  Endgame from Megadeth.
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.704]  Number one in the USA.
[02:29:41.704 --> 02:29:43.706]  Number one, and they're going on tour.
[02:29:43.706 --> 02:29:44.547]  We'll tell you about that.
[02:29:44.547 --> 02:29:51.695]  We'll talk more about the New World Order as well with Dave Mustaine, the founder, guitarist, and lead singer.
[02:29:51.695 --> 02:29:53.077]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.077 --> 02:29:55.620]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:58.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.742 --> 02:30:04.986]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:04.986 --> 02:30:06.988]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:06.988 --> 02:30:15.517]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.517 --> 02:30:21.062]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.062 --> 02:30:22.684]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.924 --> 02:30:29.426]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.426 --> 02:30:40.471]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.471 --> 02:30:41.251]  That's right.
[02:30:41.251 --> 02:30:43.812]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.812 --> 02:30:45.392]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:47.974 --> 02:31:06.029]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.029 --> 02:31:10.553]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.553 --> 02:31:12.835]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.835 --> 02:31:14.456]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.456 --> 02:31:15.497]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.717 --> 02:31:24.143]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:37.632 --> 02:31:43.653]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:32:01.107 --> 02:32:04.569]  Friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calbin Soap.
[02:32:04.569 --> 02:32:14.736]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[02:33:21.641 --> 02:33:47.464]  Dialectic Chaos, Megadeth Gotta control myself not to do air guitar Frank it up
[02:34:53.652 --> 02:34:58.437]  So that's Dialectic Chaos from Endgame.
[02:34:58.437 --> 02:35:02.781]  That sounds like old school but with a somewhat of a new edge to it.
[02:35:02.781 --> 02:35:05.884]  That sounds like old school heavy metal, speed metal almost.
[02:35:05.884 --> 02:35:07.766]  Yeah, well that's what we're trying to do.
[02:35:07.766 --> 02:35:12.090]  We're trying to stick with our roots and do what we know is what we do best.
[02:35:12.090 --> 02:35:15.454]  There was a period during the beginning of the millennium where
[02:35:16.075 --> 02:35:21.298]  Bands were really forced to go and change themselves.
[02:35:21.298 --> 02:35:31.024]  Not only change their image, change the way they look and stuff like that, but also change the way that they make their living, their music.
[02:35:31.024 --> 02:35:34.827]  Everybody needed to be like Nirvana.
[02:35:34.827 --> 02:35:38.129]  I'm sorry, that was not my cup of tea.
[02:35:38.129 --> 02:35:43.572]  We struggled through a lot of stuff and right now it's probably the most liberated that we've been with our careers and our music.
[02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:46.871]  So keeping it pure, you've got a new book coming out.
[02:35:46.871 --> 02:35:47.652]  Tell us about that.
[02:35:47.652 --> 02:35:52.855]  Right, it's called Hello Me, Meet the Real Me, which is a lyric from Sweating Bullets.
[02:35:52.855 --> 02:35:55.157]  It had to be called that, you know that.
[02:35:55.157 --> 02:35:58.219]  And it's basically me, the person.
[02:35:58.219 --> 02:36:00.321]  It's not just me, a musician.
[02:36:00.321 --> 02:36:05.625]  Because, you know, they've written everything that can be written about me as a musician from their point of view.
[02:36:06.346 --> 02:36:13.548]  And some of it's true, some of it's not, some of it's folklore, some of it makes me a lot cooler than I really am, so I just let it continue to think that way.
[02:36:13.548 --> 02:36:33.714]  But with the book itself, when I got to the last page and I closed the book, I looked up, I actually was so satiated, I was so content that they finally have got my life into a book so far, and that I read it and I went, you know what, I get it.
[02:36:34.355 --> 02:36:35.276]  This is it.
[02:36:35.276 --> 02:36:35.917]  This is it.
[02:36:35.917 --> 02:36:37.419]  This is who I am.
[02:36:37.419 --> 02:36:40.263]  I explained everything perfectly.
[02:36:40.263 --> 02:36:42.946]  And the best part about it, I think, at the end of every chapter, it's like...
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:46.022]  God, you know, he did a lot of really rotten things.
[02:36:46.022 --> 02:36:52.646]  But at the end of every chapter, it tells how, you know, all those things have been made amends for, if it's possible.
[02:36:52.646 --> 02:36:58.510]  And the people that we had all these hardships with, we've gone back and worked on things.
[02:36:58.510 --> 02:37:01.872]  Some people were in the band that I'm friends with still.
[02:37:01.872 --> 02:37:04.414]  Some people were in the band in the past, and I'm not friends with them.
[02:37:07.196 --> 02:37:09.919]  Well, I tell you, I'm excited to read the new book when it comes out.
[02:37:09.919 --> 02:37:12.281]  Tell us about your new radio show you're launching.
[02:37:12.281 --> 02:37:14.944]  You're really going wild here.
[02:37:14.944 --> 02:37:25.173]  Well, you know, I mean, you've got a great platform here for you to be able to share your heart with the American people and to educate them, which is, I think, one of the highest
[02:37:26.375 --> 02:37:27.536]  I don't think so.
[02:37:46.993 --> 02:37:47.394]  I love it!
[02:38:06.745 --> 02:38:14.232]  What they're talking about, what affects them, you know, it's hard for me to really know what it's like to have food stamps now, but you know what I did?
[02:38:14.232 --> 02:38:28.886]  I lived in a car when I was a teenager, and I was homeless, my mom was a maid, so I know all of these things that you have to go through to get by in life, and I think that's one of the things that most rock stars, they try and forget.
[02:38:30.623 --> 02:38:31.204]  Well, I agree.
[02:38:31.204 --> 02:38:46.659]  I see people's arrogance and their haughtiness, and I've been arrogant in my life at certain points, but I kind of flash back and forth, but I realize you get so much more strength and discernment when you are humble and realize how transitory this life is.
[02:38:46.659 --> 02:38:54.667]  Right, and you know, the best thing about it at the end of the day is you feel good about yourself when you've done something cool for somebody else, even if it's just enlightening them and educating them.
[02:38:55.586 --> 02:39:00.127]  You know, right now my son's almost 18, so we're going through a lot of life lessons right now.
[02:39:00.127 --> 02:39:08.669]  And yeah, he's making a lot of really costly mistakes, but nothing is... he hasn't been dismembered or disfigured yet, so everything's okay.
[02:39:08.669 --> 02:39:14.651]  But you know, I see this and I'm thinking, like, God, I want to interrupt him, I want to rescue him, and I want to, I want to, I want to.
[02:39:14.651 --> 02:39:21.792]  But that's why most of the kids in America right now are having so many problems, because all this false praise these kids are getting.
[02:39:21.792 --> 02:39:22.333]  You know what?
[02:39:22.333 --> 02:39:23.593]  Lil' Johnny ain't perfect.
[02:39:24.482 --> 02:39:25.543]  You're such a great kid!
[02:39:25.543 --> 02:39:29.865]  Well, the establishment, the controllers know that.
[02:39:29.865 --> 02:39:31.226]  They tell us we've got to be perfect.
[02:39:31.226 --> 02:39:33.207]  Madison Avenue tells us we've got to be perfect.
[02:39:33.207 --> 02:39:34.687]  So we all feel inadequate.
[02:39:34.687 --> 02:39:39.050]  So we've got to buy this death culture the New World Order is selling.
[02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:40.690]  And so, oh yeah, your kid got in a fight.
[02:39:40.690 --> 02:39:43.592]  Oh, your kid's depressed because they're going into puberty.
[02:39:43.592 --> 02:39:47.154]  Oh, they need a bunch of mind-altering, government-issued drugs.
[02:39:47.154 --> 02:39:49.775]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:49.775 --> 02:39:52.977]  That, or an isolatum, or a single amount in front of everybody.
[02:39:53.399 --> 02:39:55.400]  Orgam Electroshock Therapy.
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:06.408]  Now, you were telling me during the break, I don't know if you want to say this on air, but you're going on tour, and you were telling me there's some disinfo going on out there about the tour.
[02:40:06.408 --> 02:40:07.408]  About the tour?
[02:40:07.408 --> 02:40:08.709]  Which part?
[02:40:08.709 --> 02:40:09.790]  Oh, the Big Four?
[02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:12.612]  Yeah, there's rumors going around.
[02:40:12.612 --> 02:40:23.039]  In the beginning of heavy metal in the United States, there were four bands known as the Big Four, and that was Megadeth, Slayer, Metallica, and Anthrax.
[02:40:24.009 --> 02:40:35.877]  And, you know, it's funny whenever I have a new record coming out or anything like that, there's always something like this that perks up to kind of distract the interviews away from my interviews to something other than that.
[02:40:35.877 --> 02:40:38.659]  So this is nothing more than a rumor.
[02:40:38.659 --> 02:40:42.221]  People are saying that the four bands are going to get together and tour.
[02:40:42.221 --> 02:40:45.604]  We haven't heard anything about this other than just rumor and conjecture.
[02:40:45.604 --> 02:40:48.946]  So we are out with Slayer, which is fantastic.
[02:40:48.946 --> 02:40:51.728]  And, you know, we're trying really, really hard right now to
[02:40:52.792 --> 02:41:01.296]  Men's Broken Fences and just, you know, do the right thing with these guys because the fans love Megadeth and Slayer.
[02:41:01.296 --> 02:41:05.097]  The idea of us playing together, they're losing their minds.
[02:41:05.097 --> 02:41:12.160]  We went into Canada, it was just over the top medal euphoria for these kids.
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:13.321]  We're going down to Australia.
[02:41:13.321 --> 02:41:17.302]  I'm leaving on the 2nd down there to New Zealand, Australia, then Japan and we're coming back.
[02:41:17.302 --> 02:41:21.484]  We're going into Canada and God willing, you know, we'll be bringing this package into the States someday.
[02:41:22.850 --> 02:41:26.631]  And people can find out the tour dates around the globe at Megadeth.com.
[02:41:26.631 --> 02:41:28.531]  Death with an E, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:28.531 --> 02:41:29.631]  Megadeth.com.
[02:41:29.631 --> 02:41:34.452]  Dave Mustaine joins us, ladies and gentlemen, and we're very honored to have him.
[02:41:34.452 --> 02:41:44.835]  Dave, getting back into the whole global system, the whole New World Order, in a nutshell, if you feel like it, give us your worldview on the power structure.
[02:41:44.835 --> 02:41:51.616]  You seem to be doing a lot of research on it, and where you believe the planet is going, and what the endgame really is.
[02:41:52.970 --> 02:41:56.513]  Oh, that's a heavy question there to do all that.
[02:41:56.513 --> 02:41:57.974]  I'll try my best.
[02:41:57.974 --> 02:41:58.655]  Um, okay.
[02:41:58.655 --> 02:42:00.576]  I was brought up as a little kid.
[02:42:00.576 --> 02:42:04.680]  I got baptized at four as a Lutheran and I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness.
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:19.732]  And then, um, I revolted and got into witchcraft and black magic and then, um, spent subsequent almost a dozen years or the, you know, the following 12 years or so trying to, um,
[02:42:20.666 --> 02:42:26.771]  Get rid of the demonic oppression I got by putting hexes on people, and then I became a Christian.
[02:42:26.771 --> 02:42:30.634]  So, I mean, I've been brought up around so much different religiosity.
[02:42:30.634 --> 02:42:32.876]  I'm kind of like civil, you know what I mean?
[02:42:32.876 --> 02:42:43.464]  And when it comes down to me thinking about how things are going towards the end, I have a very distorted view of it because I've been just
[02:42:44.471 --> 02:42:46.813]  Brainwashed by the Jehovah's Witnesses.
[02:42:46.813 --> 02:42:51.777]  So, you know, when Christmas time comes around, I'm thinking, well, geez, what's the tree?
[02:42:51.777 --> 02:42:52.658]  What's all this crap?
[02:42:52.658 --> 02:43:00.325]  So, um, anyways, when it comes down to what my understanding is, is that there's going to be a final war at the end and the whole way that the Antichrist plays out.
[02:43:00.905 --> 02:43:03.167]  This may alienate some of your listeners and stuff.
[02:43:03.167 --> 02:43:05.370]  I don't mean to make anybody feel bad or alienated.
[02:43:05.370 --> 02:43:06.571]  You're allowed to have your view.
[02:43:06.571 --> 02:43:07.271]  Tell us.
[02:43:07.271 --> 02:43:09.854]  Right, right.
[02:43:09.854 --> 02:43:20.805]  The problem is that I just am cautious about this, Alex, because there's so many people that say they're Christians and they come off telling people that they're not doing stuff right, and I don't want to do that because I'm a different kind of person.
[02:43:20.805 --> 02:43:21.806]  We want to know your view.
[02:43:21.806 --> 02:43:22.547]  You're not preaching.
[02:43:22.547 --> 02:43:22.827]  Tell us.
[02:43:22.967 --> 02:43:23.667]  Right, okay, good.
[02:43:23.667 --> 02:43:26.129]  I just need to say that because I just don't want to miss out.
[02:43:26.129 --> 02:43:27.590]  No, it's an important preface.
[02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:43.599]  So, what I think right now, I'm watching the President, what you just said about him becoming the President of the UN, and I'm watching all these other things happen, like to say that one of the prophecies that came true in the Bible came from when Israel became a country again.
[02:43:43.599 --> 02:43:46.941]  And that was a prophecy that said that Israel would become a nation again.
[02:43:46.941 --> 02:43:47.921]  Well, it's a nation again.
[02:43:47.921 --> 02:43:48.902]  That happened back in the 60s.
[02:43:50.106 --> 02:43:51.067]  But it happened.
[02:43:51.067 --> 02:43:55.550]  So, you know, my belief is that there's going to be a new world order.
[02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:58.192]  There's going to be one guy that's going to run the world.
[02:43:58.192 --> 02:44:00.875]  There's going to be one currency that's around everywhere.
[02:44:00.875 --> 02:44:03.697]  They're going to try and get you to take the RFID chip.
[02:44:03.697 --> 02:44:06.319]  That's the mark of the beast that they're going to use to buy and sell things.
[02:44:06.319 --> 02:44:13.685]  And like you had brought up so brilliantly in your movie about Rockefeller, saying that if they don't like you, they're just going to turn your chip off.
[02:44:15.399 --> 02:44:16.359]  Absolutely.
[02:44:16.359 --> 02:44:30.804]  So, I mean, all of this stuff is mind-boggling, because you don't really hear about all the technology and stuff like that in the Bible, but the Bible's the basic text I've tried to live my life by, and I still have a dirty mouth, and I still look at women and have kind of terrible thoughts sometimes.
[02:44:31.685 --> 02:44:32.966]  Hey, you're not a Pharisee!
[02:44:32.966 --> 02:44:34.888]  I mean, look who Jesus hung out with.
[02:44:34.888 --> 02:44:38.473]  He didn't hang out with the Pharisees saying how great they were.
[02:44:38.473 --> 02:44:41.716]  He hung out with people who were trying to have a pure heart.
[02:44:41.716 --> 02:44:42.597]  I mean, look at David.
[02:44:42.597 --> 02:44:49.666]  Look at David, you know, had people killed so he could have their women, but he repented, and so God said, that is a man after my own heart.
[02:44:50.066 --> 02:44:50.606]  Right.
[02:44:50.606 --> 02:44:58.328]  Well, I just don't want people to try and find holes in what I'm saying, because, you know, they've heard me say something in the past that was terrible, and I know I've done that.
[02:44:58.328 --> 02:45:09.731]  That's one of the things that I'm working on with the whole Slayer Tour is that, you know, 19 years ago, 19 years ago, Alex, I said something, but people are still holding on to it, and they keep bringing it up, and it keeps causing problems.
[02:45:10.485 --> 02:45:10.906]  I think so.
[02:45:26.191 --> 02:45:29.813]  Yeah, there are people in it that are terrible, but I'm not.
[02:45:29.813 --> 02:45:35.716]  Well, it's very diverse, but Dave, I interrupted you when you were getting into your worldview.
[02:45:35.716 --> 02:45:37.036]  What do you think about the rapture?
[02:45:37.036 --> 02:45:43.439]  Because I've read the Old Testament, and it clearly says the beast will wage war against the saints and overcome them.
[02:45:43.439 --> 02:45:47.581]  How, overall, raptured out beforehand, can the beast wage war?
[02:45:47.581 --> 02:45:51.043]  How can he force people to take chips if everybody's submitting?
[02:45:51.923 --> 02:45:56.986]  This is only a 150-year-old, 140-year-old doctrine of the pre-rapture.
[02:45:56.986 --> 02:46:00.729]  And so, because everybody believes... I talk to these phony Christians.
[02:46:00.729 --> 02:46:01.910]  They won't fight any evil.
[02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:03.971]  They say, praise God, it's getting more evil.
[02:46:03.971 --> 02:46:05.892]  That means I'll be teleported out.
[02:46:05.892 --> 02:46:09.355]  I don't think Captain Kirk is going to teleport them off the surface.
[02:46:10.455 --> 02:46:12.077]  Well, I don't believe in the rapture.
[02:46:12.077 --> 02:46:13.798]  I don't know enough about it to even know what it is.
[02:46:13.798 --> 02:46:19.241]  And the fact that, you know, all of a sudden I'm going to be here and then I'm going to be someplace else.
[02:46:19.241 --> 02:46:24.165]  My understanding is that I'm going to be witness to, you know, the great Armageddon.
[02:46:24.165 --> 02:46:33.611]  So, you know, I don't know this particular part because that's a little bit more cerebral than I've gotten into because I've only been a Christian for a little while, but certainly good fodder.
[02:46:35.404 --> 02:46:36.625]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:46:36.625 --> 02:46:41.667]  You know, I will tell you, I grew up in Dallas and saw a lot of occult stuff and it was like an occult empire.
[02:46:41.667 --> 02:46:54.292]  I never really got into it, but, you know, I'd date this super good-looking girl who was a couple years older than me and, you know, and go to her parents' house, giant mansion, and find out they were Satanists and I would go out with this
[02:46:55.112 --> 02:46:55.553]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:11.689 --> 02:47:14.310]  But I wasn't because I have love in my heart.
[02:47:14.310 --> 02:47:32.834]  But I think seeing evil and not being perfect and then changing allows you to understand things and have discernment that people that have had a sheltered life or never experienced the power of the satanic empire, I believe that once you've been a little bit on the other side of it, it almost gives you an advantage because now I've been on both sides of the coin.
[02:47:33.635 --> 02:47:43.941]  Right, and that's basically what I was saying in the beginning about being able to have the credentials to talk to these fans, to be able to meet them where they're at.
[02:47:43.941 --> 02:47:46.202]  There's nothing worse than being lectured to.
[02:47:46.202 --> 02:48:01.231]  If someone wants to know something, as human beings we have, most of us, when we're curious about something, they can take it to, they can get unhuman strength and be able to sit up for hours studying things.
[02:48:01.892 --> 02:48:03.753]  You know, if they're interested in it.
[02:48:03.753 --> 02:48:07.836]  You know, for me, if I'm not interested, I can be asleep within 30 seconds.
[02:48:07.836 --> 02:48:17.524]  But because you've been into the occult, you can actually, if people ask you, explain, this wasn't fun for me, and they wouldn't listen to some preacher, but they'd listen to Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.
[02:48:17.524 --> 02:48:18.184]  Yeah, they would.
[02:48:18.184 --> 02:48:22.768]  And that's the great thing about all of this, because I'm not misusing my celebrity to
[02:48:23.288 --> 02:48:23.528]  Well, Dave,
[02:48:45.765 --> 02:48:57.769]  I mean, this is incredibly powerful what you're saying here today, and I know you're going to be a really great vessel for waking people up, but you say you've just now recently become a Christian.
[02:48:57.769 --> 02:49:11.134]  I think God's seal, the creator of the universe's seal, was on your heart from the beginning, because the fruits, you were the only heavy metal band that really didn't have that Satanism running through it, and everything you've done really was speaking against that system.
[02:49:12.114 --> 02:49:15.075]  And you said you didn't even understand what you were writing at the time.
[02:49:15.075 --> 02:49:17.475]  I think you were one of the lost sheep or the prodigal son.
[02:49:17.475 --> 02:49:24.437]  I think you've just come back home where you were always meant to be, but not in the false church, but in the real church that's in your heart.
[02:49:24.437 --> 02:49:26.377]  Well, thanks.
[02:49:26.377 --> 02:49:28.638]  I'll accept that.
[02:49:28.638 --> 02:49:37.940]  I've always felt that there was something cool that there's a much deeper meaning to what I was doing, playing on stage, because
[02:49:38.382 --> 02:49:39.445]  I don't practice, Alex.
[02:49:39.445 --> 02:49:43.859]  I pick the guitar up about three days before we go on tour and I have to learn the songs again.
[02:49:44.423 --> 02:49:46.545]  And then we got on stage and played.
[02:49:46.545 --> 02:49:49.246]  And I don't know how that happened, it just happened.
[02:49:49.246 --> 02:49:57.332]  I know that my sister played piano when I was a kid and she asked me to play guitar with her and I thought, absolutely, anything to drown out that noise.
[02:49:57.332 --> 02:50:02.916]  And I started learning how to play guitar and I would put it down and I wouldn't even look at it.
[02:50:02.916 --> 02:50:06.359]  I've lived in this new apartment here since my wife and I are separated.
[02:50:06.359 --> 02:50:08.240]  I've been here for almost a month.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:09.601]  There's a guitar here, I haven't touched it.
[02:50:11.058 --> 02:50:16.903]  And it's really weird because you would think that it would be something that would be an extension of my body, you know?
[02:50:20.222 --> 02:50:28.590]  Well, I mean, I think you're such a natural and that it's something that you pick up when you, you know, go out there to perform and just let it flow through you.
[02:50:28.590 --> 02:50:30.592]  We've got a final segment with Dave Mustaine.
[02:50:30.592 --> 02:50:32.113]  I know he's got some other stuff coming up.
[02:50:32.113 --> 02:50:37.038]  We'll see if I can twist his arm into five, ten minutes more because I want to be able to play a few more clips of his songs.
[02:50:37.038 --> 02:50:44.525]  But if he's got to leave us in about ten minutes, I would imagine, Dave, that you'll join us again when you get back from Australia.
[02:50:44.525 --> 02:50:45.246]  I would love to do that.
[02:50:46.184 --> 02:50:46.665]  Amazing.
[02:50:46.665 --> 02:50:49.748]  Again, Megadeth.com, Dave Mustaine.
[02:50:49.748 --> 02:50:51.890]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:51.890 --> 02:50:53.192]  The album is out.
[02:50:53.192 --> 02:50:55.935]  Number one record in the country.
[02:50:55.935 --> 02:50:57.897]  Out of the gates right now on Amazon.com.
[02:51:01.283 --> 02:51:05.027]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[02:51:05.027 --> 02:51:12.193]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:51:12.193 --> 02:51:17.218]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:51:17.478 --> 02:51:19.419]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:51:19.419 --> 02:51:26.044]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:51:26.044 --> 02:51:31.007]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:51:31.007 --> 02:51:40.333]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:51:40.333 --> 02:51:46.998]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:51:47.438 --> 02:51:47.778]  I think?
[02:52:01.809 --> 02:52:03.810]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.810 --> 02:52:07.431]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:07.431 --> 02:52:09.892]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.892 --> 02:52:12.954]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:12.954 --> 02:52:18.736]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:52:18.736 --> 02:52:22.678]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:52:23.018 --> 02:52:28.239]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:52:28.239 --> 02:52:31.300]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:38.561]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[02:52:38.561 --> 02:52:44.582]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:52:44.582 --> 02:52:49.123]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:52:49.443 --> 02:52:52.305]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:52:52.305 --> 02:52:54.386]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:52:54.386 --> 02:52:56.368]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:52:56.368 --> 02:52:58.509]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:52:58.509 --> 02:53:00.331]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:53:00.331 --> 02:53:02.692]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:53:02.692 --> 02:53:03.373]  Attention!
[02:53:03.373 --> 02:53:18.423]  An important product from HempUSA.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:53:18.703 --> 02:53:27.353]  Microplant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[02:53:27.353 --> 02:53:33.039]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[02:53:33.660 --> 02:53:33.900]  I think so.
[02:54:23.303 --> 02:54:26.324]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[02:54:26.324 --> 02:54:29.206]  I go to court when I have to.
[02:54:29.206 --> 02:54:31.287]  By the way, the site is almost done.
[02:54:31.287 --> 02:54:33.548]  I'm going to go ahead and launch it today.
[02:54:33.548 --> 02:54:36.089]  It is falloftherepublic.com.
[02:54:36.089 --> 02:54:42.412]  We're building some of the sub pages right now, but the new film is coming out October 21st, Fall of the Republic.
[02:54:42.952 --> 02:54:50.998]  And on Sunday's show, I'm going to show you the cover of the film, but the website is similar, falltherepublic.com.
[02:54:50.998 --> 02:54:53.560]  Megadeth.com is Dave Mustaine's band site.
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:56.323]  He's the founder, guitarist, and lead singer.
[02:54:56.323 --> 02:54:59.965]  The album is number one on many charts, number one on Amazon right now.
[02:54:59.965 --> 02:55:01.066]  They're going on tour.
[02:55:01.066 --> 02:55:02.167]  His new book is coming out.
[02:55:02.167 --> 02:55:05.310]  Find out about it all at megadeth.com.
[02:55:05.310 --> 02:55:08.852]  And you just heard the intro to Peace Sells There.
[02:55:08.852 --> 02:55:10.854]  Dave, we've got about five minutes left.
[02:55:10.854 --> 02:55:12.015]  I've asked a lot of questions.
[02:55:12.695 --> 02:55:14.037]  What's on Dave Mustang's mind?
[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:36.070]  All the headbanging over all the years and just working on myself, trying to work on things with my kids and my marriage and stuff.
[02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:40.175]  Just looking at my life in general and what do I do?
[02:55:40.175 --> 02:55:41.456]  What's my role?
[02:55:41.456 --> 02:55:42.337]  How can I help people?
[02:55:44.619 --> 02:55:51.203]  You've got another interview coming up, but Dave's going to be back on with us in November when his next tour gets ready to kick off.
[02:55:51.203 --> 02:56:00.149]  We'll have a lot more to talk about, but let me just tell you from my perspective, we're getting calls, emails, huge comments on our message board, in the comment sections.
[02:56:00.149 --> 02:56:08.055]  People love, and I'm talking about Serious Death fans, Serious Megadeth fans, they love the new album, and I think it's going to be one of your biggest and greatest.
[02:56:08.795 --> 02:56:10.215]  Well, we've got a lot of great reviews.
[02:56:10.215 --> 02:56:15.317]  You know, by no means is anything over yet, and this band would be really blessed if we were able to gain some of your following.
[02:56:33.849 --> 02:56:37.112]  And basically, you know, you and I are speaking the same language.
[02:56:37.112 --> 02:56:39.034]  We're singing from the same, you know, hymnal.
[02:56:39.034 --> 02:56:45.859]  But, you know, with what we're trying to do, get these tours out of the way.
[02:56:45.859 --> 02:56:52.605]  Yeah, you can plan on us being back in the studio or me visiting you out there for some barbecue in November.
[02:56:52.605 --> 02:56:53.646]  Man, that is awesome.
[02:56:53.646 --> 02:56:56.308]  I'll come out whenever I'm out in your neck of the woods.
[02:56:56.308 --> 02:56:57.610]  Maybe we can hook up for some barbecue.
[02:56:57.610 --> 02:56:58.690]  But it is better.
[02:56:58.690 --> 02:56:59.271]  It is better here.
[02:56:59.271 --> 02:57:00.192]  You're out in California.
[02:57:00.192 --> 02:57:01.373]  I guess they got good sushi there.
[02:57:03.203 --> 02:57:06.346]  Yeah, everybody says they got good sushi out here and you know what?
[02:57:06.346 --> 02:57:10.150]  You go into one of these places and it's like, I didn't know tuna was green.
[02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:23.064]  Anyways, back to what we were talking about before, it would be really great to invite you and your crew down to our concert too if you want to bring our film crew down there and we can talk some more there and show you a little bit about what I do.
[02:57:23.872 --> 02:57:25.232]  Absolutely killer!
[02:57:25.232 --> 02:57:28.553]  Well, Dave, we'll stay in touch with you and your management.
[02:57:28.553 --> 02:57:32.754]  And you are really trailblazing with your record label.
[02:57:32.754 --> 02:57:33.854]  People should support it.
[02:57:33.854 --> 02:57:35.114]  It is independent.
[02:57:35.114 --> 02:57:35.954]  It is maverick.
[02:57:35.954 --> 02:57:38.014]  It is original and authentic.
[02:57:38.014 --> 02:57:40.715]  Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth.
[02:57:40.715 --> 02:57:42.115]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:57:42.115 --> 02:57:45.756]  The new album is In Game.
[02:57:45.756 --> 02:57:46.696]  Dave, thank you so much.
[02:57:46.696 --> 02:57:47.516]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:57:47.516 --> 02:57:47.796]  Take care.
[02:57:47.796 --> 02:57:48.536]  All right.
[02:57:48.536 --> 02:57:50.056]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:57:50.056 --> 02:57:51.337]  Well, that is exciting.
[02:57:51.337 --> 02:57:52.717]  There goes Dave.
[02:57:52.717 --> 02:57:52.937]  Man.
[02:57:54.227 --> 02:57:55.868]  Again, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:55.868 --> 02:57:59.069]  And Muse is doing interviews, saying 9-11's an inside job.
[02:57:59.069 --> 02:58:00.209]  They've been on the show.
[02:58:00.209 --> 02:58:03.230]  Bellamy, it's one of the number one bands right now.
[02:58:03.230 --> 02:58:11.772]  If I told you some of the other music icons I've talked to, or that I know, or that I know through other people that are aware of the New World Order, you wouldn't believe it.
[02:58:11.772 --> 02:58:13.613]  The Hollywood people, you wouldn't believe it.
[02:58:14.915 --> 02:58:15.936]  There is an awakening.
[02:58:15.936 --> 02:58:18.718]  The general public doesn't want world government, world tyranny.
[02:58:18.718 --> 02:58:21.860]  That's why at the G20, they've got to have the police come out.
[02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:29.145]  In fact, I meant when Dave was on to play that armored vehicle audio and video where they're saying, you are not allowed to assemble.
[02:58:29.145 --> 02:58:39.572]  In fact, we'll come back with that after this break, and then we'll come in with the music after that, John, and then we're going to get a report from the G20 from our reporters on the ground, and then Bob Chapman pops back in.
[02:58:39.572 --> 02:58:40.732]  Stay with us!
[02:58:40.732 --> 02:58:40.913]  Yeah!
[02:58:42.861 --> 02:58:46.123]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.123 --> 02:58:50.746]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.746 --> 02:58:54.148]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.148 --> 02:58:57.770]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.770 --> 02:59:02.333]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.333 --> 02:59:07.937]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.217 --> 02:59:12.980]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:12.980 --> 02:59:16.602]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.602 --> 02:59:21.425]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.425 --> 02:59:27.989]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:27.989 --> 02:59:29.930]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.430 --> 02:59:33.632]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.632 --> 02:59:38.135]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.135 --> 02:59:39.917]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:39.917 --> 02:59:40.357]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.357 --> 02:59:40.637]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.637 --> 02:59:40.897]  Don't wait.
[02:59:40.897 --> 02:59:41.518]  Call today.
[02:59:41.518 --> 02:59:42.558]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.558 --> 02:59:43.839]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:23.473 --> 03:00:24.554]  I'm your sister.
[03:00:24.554 --> 03:00:27.515]  I go to court when I have to.
[03:00:27.515 --> 03:00:31.957]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[03:00:31.957 --> 03:00:33.798]  I've got nothing better to do.
[03:00:33.798 --> 03:00:35.919]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[03:00:35.919 --> 03:00:37.340]  What do you think, I'm broke?
[03:00:37.340 --> 03:00:37.460]  Huh?
[03:00:37.460 --> 03:00:41.562]  If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line.
[03:01:00.643 --> 03:01:03.325]  What do you mean I hurt your feelings?
[03:01:03.325 --> 03:01:05.486]  I didn't know you had any feelings.
[03:01:05.486 --> 03:01:09.688]  What do you mean I ain't kind?
[03:01:09.688 --> 03:01:11.630]  I'm just not your kind.
[03:01:11.630 --> 03:01:19.054]  What do you mean I couldn't be the President of the United States of America?
[03:01:19.054 --> 03:01:20.735]  Tell me something.
[03:01:20.735 --> 03:01:24.557]  It's still we, the people, right?
[03:01:33.527 --> 03:01:34.247]  First in line!
[03:01:34.247 --> 03:01:39.129]  But it better work this time!
[03:01:39.129 --> 03:01:40.049]  This time!
[03:01:40.049 --> 03:01:44.070]  Peace sells!
[03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:45.730]  Peace sells!
[03:01:45.730 --> 03:01:46.971]  I love that end part.
[03:01:46.971 --> 03:01:47.651]  It's coming up!
[03:01:47.651 --> 03:01:49.091]  Crank it up, baby!
[03:01:49.091 --> 03:01:50.152]  Yeah!
[03:01:50.152 --> 03:01:55.893]  We're taking on the new world order!
[03:01:55.893 --> 03:01:57.473]  Yeah!
[03:01:57.473 --> 03:01:58.794]  Let them see your war face!
[03:02:16.678 --> 03:02:22.822]  We used to go to meet people from school, high school, that wanted to get in a fight.
[03:02:22.822 --> 03:02:27.366]  We'd pull into a field, this cranking up, slide out of the car, just start going wild.
[03:02:27.366 --> 03:02:28.146]  But you know what?
[03:02:28.146 --> 03:02:30.848]  I put all that energy into fighting the New World Order now.
[03:02:30.848 --> 03:02:31.989]  Crank it up!
[03:02:31.989 --> 03:02:32.749]  Peace!
[03:02:32.749 --> 03:02:33.530]  Peace!
[03:02:33.530 --> 03:02:34.551]  Here it is!
[03:02:49.906 --> 03:03:10.614]  Man, that is rockin', baby!
[03:03:10.614 --> 03:03:14.415]  Yeah!
[03:03:14.415 --> 03:03:18.177]  Dave Mustaine, joining the fight against the New World Order.
[03:03:19.195 --> 03:03:24.596]  Control of demonstrations and non-lethal ammunition can cause the risk of injury to those who remain.
[03:03:51.357 --> 03:03:51.877]  That's a sound weapon.
[03:03:51.877 --> 03:03:57.641]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[03:03:57.641 --> 03:04:01.544]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[03:04:01.544 --> 03:04:03.345]  You must leave the immediate vicinity.
[03:04:03.345 --> 03:04:05.366]  If you remain in this immediate vicinity,
[03:04:14.412 --> 03:04:17.974]  You will be in violation of Pennsylvania Crimes Code.
[03:04:17.974 --> 03:04:21.335]  I'll tell you what's unlawful is what these police are doing.
[03:04:21.335 --> 03:04:23.216]  There's the crime.
[03:04:23.216 --> 03:04:24.257]  Unbelievable.
[03:04:24.257 --> 03:04:26.117]  That's a great point Jaron just made.
[03:04:26.117 --> 03:04:29.459]  The thing that looks like a crime is those ring wreaths and those black outfits.
[03:04:29.459 --> 03:04:30.599]  That's the true evil.
[03:04:30.599 --> 03:04:32.580]  Posing is good.
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:36.822]  You see they look foul and they are foul.
[03:04:36.822 --> 03:04:40.584]  Some of us look foul but feel fair.
[03:04:40.584 --> 03:04:42.045]  Others look fair but feel foul.
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:44.622]  Trust your gut.
[03:04:44.622 --> 03:04:46.224]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:46.224 --> 03:04:48.247]  InfoWars.com.
[03:04:48.247 --> 03:04:49.869]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:49.869 --> 03:04:54.055]  We're going directly live to the G20 with world government being announced straight ahead.
[03:05:01.616 --> 03:05:04.618]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.618 --> 03:05:09.941]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.941 --> 03:05:12.002]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.002 --> 03:05:17.004]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.004 --> 03:05:18.185]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.185 --> 03:05:19.306]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.306 --> 03:05:21.187]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.187 --> 03:05:22.267]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.267 --> 03:05:24.469]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:25.809]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.809 --> 03:05:27.110]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.310 --> 03:05:32.595]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.595 --> 03:05:36.179]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.179 --> 03:05:40.003]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.003 --> 03:05:41.224]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.224 --> 03:05:42.125]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.125 --> 03:05:43.226]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.226 --> 03:05:43.967]  All you can get.
[03:05:43.967 --> 03:05:44.968]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.248 --> 03:05:48.292]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.292 --> 03:05:50.074]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.074 --> 03:05:50.995]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.615 --> 03:06:05.922]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.922 --> 03:06:10.468]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.468 --> 03:06:12.731]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.731 --> 03:06:14.373]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.373 --> 03:06:15.395]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.615 --> 03:06:24.057]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.057 --> 03:06:31.499]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:06:31.499 --> 03:06:37.541]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[03:06:37.541 --> 03:06:43.122]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:06:43.562 --> 03:06:47.708]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:06:47.708 --> 03:06:53.936]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[03:06:53.936 --> 03:06:55.178]  866-762-9238.
[03:06:55.178 --> 03:06:58.483]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[03:07:01.124 --> 03:07:06.286]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[03:07:06.286 --> 03:07:09.787]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:07:09.787 --> 03:07:15.509]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:07:15.509 --> 03:07:18.070]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:22.611]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:07:22.611 --> 03:07:25.332]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:07:25.772 --> 03:07:31.518]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:07:31.518 --> 03:07:33.760]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:07:33.760 --> 03:07:42.329]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:07:42.329 --> 03:07:43.330]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:07:43.690 --> 03:07:48.275]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:07:48.275 --> 03:07:53.380]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:55.142]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:07:55.142 --> 03:07:57.344]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:07:57.344 --> 03:07:59.086]  Be well and stay well.
[03:07:59.086 --> 03:07:59.807]  Best MZ!
[03:08:01.522 --> 03:08:06.928]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.928 --> 03:08:09.291]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:09.291 --> 03:08:14.857]  Folks, we're launching the Charlie Sheen 9-11 offensive against the Globalist.
[03:08:14.857 --> 03:08:19.022]  Finishing the film, which is now officially done.
[03:08:19.963 --> 03:08:20.323]  I think so.
[03:08:36.295 --> 03:08:38.996]  That means that in the orders, it ships out first.
[03:08:38.996 --> 03:08:46.159]  And we're probably gonna, just like with Camp FEMA, probably gonna start shipping this a few days before October 21st on that Wednesday.
[03:08:46.159 --> 03:08:48.660]  We're gonna shoot to start shipping Monday.
[03:08:48.660 --> 03:08:51.041]  With UPS, everybody gets it within three days.
[03:08:51.041 --> 03:08:53.962]  Most people in the U.S., depending on where you live, within two days.
[03:08:53.962 --> 03:09:00.624]  So a lot of people get it on the 21st of October, pre-order today at InfoWars.com.
[03:09:00.624 --> 03:09:03.826]  In fact, I meant to get in this morning and tell them to go ahead and get it up on the shopping cart.
[03:09:03.826 --> 03:09:04.546]  We haven't done that.
[03:09:05.086 --> 03:09:11.849]  Curt Nimmo is finishing up the Fall of the Republic sub-pages, because we've all been racing with other work.
[03:09:11.849 --> 03:09:16.051]  In fact, can we put FalloftheRepublic.com up on screen for folks?
[03:09:16.051 --> 03:09:20.093]  Now, this isn't the video cover, but we'll show you the video cover coming up this weekend.
[03:09:20.093 --> 03:09:23.034]  It'll be posted on Infowars.com.
[03:09:23.034 --> 03:09:27.836]  We'll probably even this afternoon get it up for pre-sale, Friday afternoon, Friday evening.
[03:09:27.836 --> 03:09:33.019]  Now, almost every new film I make, I say, this is my greatest film ever.
[03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:35.701]  Because each film gets better.
[03:09:35.701 --> 03:09:51.955]  I mean, you saw what we went from, you know, America Destroyed by Design, to Police State 2000, to Police State 2 The Takeover, right through Police State 3, Matrix of Evil, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law,
[03:09:53.797 --> 03:10:05.086]  And all the other documentaries like Terror Storm, and The Order of Death, and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and American Dictators, and Endgame was a whole other level.
[03:10:05.086 --> 03:10:10.470]  Information-wise, it's the total combo that really gives you a good view on everything.
[03:10:10.470 --> 03:10:20.058]  The Obama Deception, the biggest film we've ever released, the most viral, the most successful, the most DVDs handed out people have made copies of and given it to people, the biggest film we've had.
[03:10:21.331 --> 03:10:24.974]  Conservatively, over 100 million people have seen my films free online.
[03:10:24.974 --> 03:10:29.557]  I mean, it's gotta be over 25 million now just with Obama deception.
[03:10:29.557 --> 03:10:32.359]  And of course, I executive produce, loose change, final cuts, seen by millions.
[03:10:32.359 --> 03:10:45.128]  The point is, is that when I tell you that Fall of the Republic blows everything we've ever made away, believe me, my most expensive film was about $120,000 to make.
[03:10:45.128 --> 03:10:45.568]  That was endgame.
[03:10:50.191 --> 03:10:54.974]  Obama deception, because we rushed the making of it, and it's really good, was only about 80 grand.
[03:10:54.974 --> 03:10:59.277]  This film, for me, it sounds like nothing to people that are, you know, big, huge movie makers.
[03:10:59.277 --> 03:11:02.379]  $200,000 budget, to give you an idea.
[03:11:02.379 --> 03:11:10.004]  And six months making it, I mean, I'm up here until 1, 2 at night, 6, 7 days a week.
[03:11:10.004 --> 03:11:11.605]  This thing is unbelievable.
[03:11:11.605 --> 03:11:15.388]  I mean, and oh, here's another big announcement about it.
[03:11:15.388 --> 03:11:16.729]  It's Fall of the Republic Volume 1.
[03:11:18.274 --> 03:11:28.579]  We ended up about a month ago with a four-hour film, all this new info coming in, and I said, there's no way, I can't make, now the film is two hours, 22 minutes long.
[03:11:28.579 --> 03:11:36.283]  No, 24 minutes, I added, I made everybody shoot some more stuff last night on some other issues, we just added it, but that was why it was finally done this morning.
[03:11:36.283 --> 03:11:40.565]  That's why Aaron's not here, he was up all night.
[03:11:40.565 --> 03:11:43.166]  Fall of the Republic is 224 minutes long,
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:54.104]  It has 19 interviews, but also footage on the ground, voiceover, documents, I mean video clips, the research that went into it.
[03:11:54.104 --> 03:11:59.147]  No film I've ever made has as much research, and it's part one.
[03:11:59.147 --> 03:12:05.350]  It covers how the banks did the takeover, the derivatives, the scam, their world government plan.
[03:12:05.350 --> 03:12:11.213]  It gets into the eugenics, TV mind control, how they control society, the citizen spy networks, just
[03:12:12.383 --> 03:12:19.029]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's got Jesse Ventura, Max Keiser, Bob Bowman, Webster Tarpley, George Humphrey.
[03:12:19.029 --> 03:12:24.393]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[03:12:24.393 --> 03:12:25.634]  But I've got to get a full list of that.
[03:12:25.634 --> 03:12:26.915]  19 interviews.
[03:12:26.915 --> 03:12:34.682]  I put people on 17 airplanes to fly to Canada and California and Florida.
[03:12:34.682 --> 03:12:36.804]  John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[03:12:38.837 --> 03:12:39.977]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[03:12:39.977 --> 03:12:44.738]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[03:12:44.738 --> 03:12:45.438]  Oath Keepers.
[03:12:45.438 --> 03:12:48.499]  We went to 10 cities in California.
[03:12:48.499 --> 03:12:49.940]  17 missions.
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:53.680]  We flew two groups of people here to be interviewed.
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:55.841]  I'm in the film.
[03:12:55.841 --> 03:13:00.962]  And the voiceover is the best boil-down script of key information.
[03:13:00.962 --> 03:13:05.143]  The analysis, again, it's going on sale this afternoon or tomorrow.
[03:13:06.658 --> 03:13:11.002]  The next few weeks we've got two big trailers coming out that'll give you a sneak peek at it.
[03:13:11.002 --> 03:13:14.465]  Start pre-ordering tonight or tomorrow when it goes up.
[03:13:14.465 --> 03:13:17.708]  Falloftherepublic.com.
[03:13:17.708 --> 03:13:20.730]  That says Infowars.com Fall of the Republic.
[03:13:20.730 --> 03:13:23.233]  The main site's not up?
[03:13:23.233 --> 03:13:26.035]  So people can just go to falloftherepublic.com and get it.
[03:13:26.035 --> 03:13:26.656]  Okay, good.
[03:13:26.656 --> 03:13:29.678]  Yeah, so the actual URL is falloftherepublic.com.
[03:13:29.678 --> 03:13:30.859]  I'm just looking at Infowars.
[03:13:32.370 --> 03:13:37.714]  URL subpage version of it there on screen.
[03:13:37.714 --> 03:13:40.576]  But the point is they've denied world government was here.
[03:13:40.576 --> 03:13:42.797]  They've denied world government was happening.
[03:13:42.797 --> 03:13:45.019]  They've denied world government was a reality.
[03:13:45.019 --> 03:13:48.902]  And then now they've had to admit it's all real, and we go back over their history, everything.
[03:13:48.902 --> 03:13:50.283]  I'm telling you.
[03:13:50.283 --> 03:13:56.047]  I was watching this film last night at about 1.30 in the morning after I got off Coast to Coast AM.
[03:13:56.047 --> 03:13:57.228]  Been working on it before and then after.
[03:13:58.021 --> 03:14:09.555]  And I said to Aaron and to Rob Jacobson, who really deserve as much credit as myself or anybody else in this film, I couldn't do it without these two men and their dedication.
[03:14:09.555 --> 03:14:13.460]  Because you have to get more people on it, but if you have something like this, it has to be a small number so that
[03:14:14.872 --> 03:14:18.996]  I'm not comparing myself to Stanley Kubrick, but people said you go to his sets, there'd be 10 people on them.
[03:14:18.996 --> 03:14:22.259]  You go to a regular Hollywood set, there'd be hundreds or thousands.
[03:14:22.259 --> 03:14:23.140]  It's the same thing here.
[03:14:23.140 --> 03:14:25.362]  It's just a very small, knit group.
[03:14:25.362 --> 03:14:35.672]  Burmess has worked on it, Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Mike McWhorter, Mr. Dill, everybody who was involved in this.
[03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:54.182]  The guys that did the music, Derek Einkauf, Craig, Will Jones, all the guys are such great musicians, because we got three guys that work here that are in the same band here in Austin, that the music is title track in a major motion picture good.
[03:14:54.182 --> 03:14:54.663]  And I love
[03:14:57.438 --> 03:15:01.921]  Mr. Reynolds, who we've used in other films, and he's great, and he's gotten orchestras together for it.
[03:15:01.921 --> 03:15:06.925]  We shouldn't have the time to do that, but this turned out just as good, and different.
[03:15:06.925 --> 03:15:09.808]  So, Rob Jacobson made some of the music.
[03:15:09.808 --> 03:15:13.851]  I mean, it is just, it is a out-of-the-park success.
[03:15:13.851 --> 03:15:19.215]  This is going to be devastating to the New World Order, and all the glory goes to God.
[03:15:19.215 --> 03:15:19.655]  I tell ya,
[03:15:21.124 --> 03:15:28.306]  To bust your butt like this, to get black circles around your eyes, to accelerate your aging, you know, working so hard, your hair falling out.
[03:15:28.306 --> 03:15:29.247]  I don't care.
[03:15:29.247 --> 03:15:38.190]  I love just spending myself on a worthy cause, to know those dedications, those passions, to be able to make something like Fall of the Republic.
[03:15:38.190 --> 03:15:39.030]  It's volume one.
[03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:45.632]  Volume two is going to be eugenics, mind control, the concentration camps, and how to defeat them.
[03:15:45.632 --> 03:15:47.393]  There's a lot of solutions in this film as well.
[03:15:49.777 --> 03:15:50.958]  Gerald Salente's in it.
[03:15:50.958 --> 03:15:52.499]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[03:15:52.499 --> 03:15:56.741]  The point is, this is heads above.
[03:15:56.741 --> 03:15:58.862]  Before, the films were a little better than before.
[03:15:58.862 --> 03:16:01.603]  This is a whole quantum leap.
[03:16:01.603 --> 03:16:05.185]  And we have better computers and more research and we're better at what we do now.
[03:16:05.185 --> 03:16:08.066]  It is a quantum leap.
[03:16:08.066 --> 03:16:13.389]  A whole nother level above any film I have ever produced.
[03:16:15.808 --> 03:16:17.308]  It is a quantum leap.
[03:16:17.308 --> 03:16:19.449]  The IT guys helping us with the systems to get it done.
[03:16:19.449 --> 03:16:20.469]  Everybody.
[03:16:20.469 --> 03:16:22.010]  And you the listeners that have supported us.
[03:16:22.010 --> 03:16:28.151]  You especially need credit for your financial support buying the other books and videos and t-shirts and materials and supporting our sponsors.
[03:16:28.151 --> 03:16:37.233]  You have made this possible where we have the financing to send 17 crews out at around $5,000 per trip.
[03:16:37.233 --> 03:16:40.834]  I don't know what 17 times 5,000.
[03:16:40.834 --> 03:16:43.355]  I've done the math and the total budget of this thing.
[03:16:43.355 --> 03:16:44.575]  The graphics, everything.
[03:16:47.148 --> 03:16:49.669]  It's just so fulfilling to be on the right side of history.
[03:16:49.669 --> 03:16:51.529]  It's so fulfilling to know the truth.
[03:16:51.529 --> 03:16:53.449]  It's so fulfilling to be proven right.
[03:16:53.449 --> 03:17:03.791]  It's so fulfilling when we get the death threats and the COINTELPRO and the lies and the attacks, each one worse than the next, to know they're attacking us because we are doing good, because we are having an effect in history.
[03:17:03.791 --> 03:17:05.972]  We do matter with this species.
[03:17:05.972 --> 03:17:11.713]  And the way the film ends, I'm going to leave that as a surprise.
[03:17:11.713 --> 03:17:12.513]  Follow the Republic.
[03:17:12.513 --> 03:17:16.414]  I'm going to quit waxing here eloquent about it, but it is just
[03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:18.400]  Follow the Republic.
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:19.700]  Goes on pre-sale tonight or tomorrow.
[03:17:19.700 --> 03:17:20.201]  I'm not sure when.
[03:17:20.201 --> 03:17:22.841]  We've got to get it up all properly at InfoWars.com.
[03:17:22.841 --> 03:17:24.061]  You can start writing to us.
[03:17:24.061 --> 03:17:24.462]  It's $19.95.
[03:17:24.462 --> 03:17:31.803]  You can start writing to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[03:17:31.803 --> 03:17:33.884]  Of course, we're not really using that address anymore.
[03:17:33.884 --> 03:17:36.304]  It's better to send it to InfoWars, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:17:40.609 --> 03:17:40.829]  P.O.
[03:17:40.829 --> 03:17:45.151]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760 or Infowars.com.
[03:17:45.151 --> 03:17:48.193]  And of course, October 21st it will debut in super high quality.
[03:17:48.193 --> 03:17:51.254]  We're even trying to put it out on the web in actual high def.
[03:17:51.254 --> 03:17:52.335]  I think we're going to be able to do that.
[03:17:52.335 --> 03:17:57.157]  It's close to high def right now in the highest quality, but we're having a bunch of versions at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:17:57.157 --> 03:17:59.558]  Okay, I got my guys holding.
[03:17:59.558 --> 03:18:03.460]  Let's go to Jason Burmas and then Jason Douglas also on the phone from the middle of the crowd.
[03:18:03.460 --> 03:18:05.681]  What's happened since an hour and a half ago when I talked to you?
[03:18:06.425 --> 03:18:08.626]  Well, now we're on mobile, Alex.
[03:18:08.626 --> 03:18:13.247]  The police force has a much greater presence as we reach downtown.
[03:18:13.247 --> 03:18:16.648]  I told you you're gonna march in, they're gonna surround you.
[03:18:16.648 --> 03:18:18.248]  It's very possible.
[03:18:18.248 --> 03:18:27.531]  I'm not sure where this is ending right now, but, you know, I've got video of hundreds of police officers now masked at the block, many of them in riot gear.
[03:18:27.531 --> 03:18:29.032]  Many of them a little overzealous.
[03:18:29.032 --> 03:18:31.492]  I mean, some people are throwing the peace sign up.
[03:18:31.492 --> 03:18:33.673]  But, you know, a young lady, again,
[03:18:34.193 --> 03:18:40.699]  Not weighing more than 105 pounds, dared to put one of her feet on the sidewalk next to me and she was threatened with a baton.
[03:18:40.699 --> 03:18:41.960]  I got it on video.
[03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:44.142]  I mean, come on!
[03:18:44.142 --> 03:18:50.708]  You know, I just keep running into Cindy Sheehan and the masses of thousands of people and Cindy was standing next to her.
[03:18:50.708 --> 03:18:52.890]  She couldn't believe that he even raised her baton.
[03:18:52.890 --> 03:18:53.631]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:18:54.231 --> 03:18:58.172]  It's a little bit of controlled madness right now, Alex.
[03:18:58.172 --> 03:18:59.433]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:18:59.433 --> 03:19:00.833]  We are mobile yet again.
[03:19:00.833 --> 03:19:06.235]  Stopped at the Capitol for a while while there was some sort of a concert going on.
[03:19:06.235 --> 03:19:11.697]  And right now I can see, I believe it's the 7th Street or Clemente Bridge.
[03:19:11.697 --> 03:19:13.998]  I'm not sure which one.
[03:19:13.998 --> 03:19:18.560]  I can tell you I'm at the corner of 6th Avenue and it may be 6th and
[03:19:20.080 --> 03:19:26.698]  Sixth and Seventh Street where they converge and there are thousands of people and hundreds of police officers quoting off sideshow.
[03:19:28.158 --> 03:19:29.139]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:19:29.139 --> 03:19:31.120]  They're getting ready to lock down the main protest.
[03:19:31.120 --> 03:19:32.301]  You guys need to split up.
[03:19:32.301 --> 03:19:38.106]  Somebody at the front, somebody at the back with a plan to get out of there quick if they start closing it down.
[03:19:38.106 --> 03:19:38.786]  Stay there, Jason.
[03:19:38.786 --> 03:19:41.108]  I want more from you and Jason Douglas as well.
[03:19:41.108 --> 03:19:44.991]  Jason Douglas, Jason Burmess, Rob Dude doing a great job.
[03:19:44.991 --> 03:19:46.051]  Pray for him.
[03:19:46.051 --> 03:19:47.412]  On the ground at the G20.
[03:19:47.412 --> 03:19:49.314]  Open world government being announced.
[03:19:49.314 --> 03:19:50.955]  What an insane show today.
[03:19:50.955 --> 03:19:54.458]  Dave Mustaine on the heels of Congressman Ron Paul and Congressman Grayson.
[03:19:54.959 --> 03:19:55.502]  Yesterday.
[03:19:55.502 --> 03:19:57.936]  More huge guests coming up in the next few weeks.
[03:19:57.936 --> 03:19:58.398]  Stay with us.
[03:20:03.917 --> 03:20:06.979]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[03:20:06.979 --> 03:20:09.620]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[03:20:09.620 --> 03:20:13.383]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[03:20:13.383 --> 03:20:20.086]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[03:20:20.086 --> 03:20:23.969]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[03:20:23.969 --> 03:20:27.911]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[03:20:28.331 --> 03:20:28.952]  We're good to go!
[03:20:51.741 --> 03:20:52.101]  Let's do it!
[03:21:02.242 --> 03:21:03.263]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:21:03.263 --> 03:21:08.805]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:21:08.805 --> 03:21:09.346]  I get it.
[03:21:09.346 --> 03:21:18.970]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:21:18.970 --> 03:21:20.371]  That's not what's happening.
[03:21:20.371 --> 03:21:24.753]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:21:24.953 --> 03:21:26.795]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[03:21:26.795 --> 03:21:28.837]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:21:28.837 --> 03:21:32.240]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:21:32.240 --> 03:21:36.504]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:21:36.504 --> 03:21:38.105]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:21:38.105 --> 03:21:42.069]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:21:42.069 --> 03:21:45.892]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:21:45.892 --> 03:21:46.793]  You should too.
[03:21:46.793 --> 03:21:47.954]  Find out what they know.
[03:21:47.954 --> 03:21:51.177]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:21:51.357 --> 03:21:52.057]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:52.057 --> 03:21:54.439]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:54.439 --> 03:22:01.943]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:01.943 --> 03:22:07.666]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:22:07.666 --> 03:22:09.027]  And we knew what to do.
[03:22:09.027 --> 03:22:10.968]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:22:10.968 --> 03:22:18.012]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:22:18.012 --> 03:22:18.392]  Whitman
[03:22:19.565 --> 03:22:26.541]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:22:26.909 --> 03:22:34.015]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:22:34.015 --> 03:22:37.178]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:22:37.178 --> 03:22:42.963]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:22:42.963 --> 03:22:46.026]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:22:46.026 --> 03:22:52.071]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:22:52.071 --> 03:22:53.933]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:55.841 --> 03:22:59.938]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:23:01.502 --> 03:23:08.226]  Are you constantly tired, have a hard time concentrating, experience muscle weakness, or have problems with digestion?
[03:23:08.226 --> 03:23:11.248]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:23:11.248 --> 03:23:17.912]  Liquid Zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[03:23:17.912 --> 03:23:22.554]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[03:23:22.554 --> 03:23:30.779]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[03:23:31.159 --> 03:23:31.579]  I think so.
[03:24:01.656 --> 03:24:02.378]  We're good to go.
[03:24:19.662 --> 03:24:21.242]  This is yesterday in Pittsburgh.
[03:24:21.242 --> 03:24:23.543]  Same thing's going on now.
[03:24:23.543 --> 03:24:29.964]  This is not a flashback to Police State 2000 shot in 1999 with the Marines drilling to take over U.S.
[03:24:29.964 --> 03:24:31.865]  City saying the same thing.
[03:24:42.987 --> 03:24:46.491]  This is what the military, NORTHCOM, Homeland Security is for.
[03:24:46.491 --> 03:24:47.452]  It is for you.
[03:24:47.452 --> 03:24:52.458]  Mainstream news announcing Obama's President of the World, bringing us into the New World Order.
[03:24:52.458 --> 03:24:54.360]  Those are the headlines.
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:58.285]  8,000 plus articles in Google News with the term New World Order in them.
[03:24:58.285 --> 03:25:01.649]  Jason Burmess, what is it like to see this actually unfolding?
[03:25:02.824 --> 03:25:05.246]  Honestly, it's extremely encouraging, Alex.
[03:25:05.246 --> 03:25:09.248]  This protest has gone much better than the one yesterday.
[03:25:09.248 --> 03:25:11.490]  Again, I'm not hoping for disaster at the end.
[03:25:11.490 --> 03:25:14.832]  We are currently crossing the bridge by the thousands.
[03:25:14.832 --> 03:25:18.875]  When you see a helicopter aerial shot of this, you will be astounded.
[03:25:18.875 --> 03:25:22.738]  Again, thousands of people trying to get their message out.
[03:25:22.738 --> 03:25:25.019]  Riot police lining the streets.
[03:25:25.019 --> 03:25:28.282]  I don't know what's going to be in store for us on the other side of the bridge.
[03:25:28.282 --> 03:25:29.783]  As I said, as we approach this,
[03:25:30.544 --> 03:25:35.435]  The riot queue of police and the military presence became much, much greater.
[03:25:36.849 --> 03:26:01.431]  Jason, you're going to be live Sunday 6 to 9 p.m., but I want to have you, Rob Dew, and Jason Douglas in studio in the first hour Sunday when you're back, and if you guys can come in and get a few of the key video clips like what Douglas says he has of them sound canoning people on their front porch and little kids, we'll play some clips of that on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv on Sunday ahead of your show.
[03:26:01.431 --> 03:26:02.732]  I know they've got to get back to their families.
[03:26:02.732 --> 03:26:03.533]  They've been gone all week.
[03:26:04.453 --> 03:26:07.735]  As soon as I get off that plane, I will start capturing video.
[03:26:07.735 --> 03:26:11.237]  This is just too important not to get out to the masses as soon as possible.
[03:26:18.462 --> 03:26:26.869]  Yeah, we should have probably sent another just web person you could hand the stuff off to to do it, but then we didn't send the right equipment, but that's okay.
[03:26:26.869 --> 03:26:29.491]  You know, we're not professional soldiers in the Info War here.
[03:26:29.491 --> 03:26:34.255]  We're professional amateurs doing the best we can to fight the New World Order.
[03:26:34.255 --> 03:26:35.857]  Let's go to Jason Douglas.
[03:26:35.857 --> 03:26:40.180]  Stay there, Burmess, but I want to go back to Jason Douglas.
[03:26:40.180 --> 03:26:41.341]  Two Jasons here.
[03:26:41.341 --> 03:26:43.683]  Douglas, what have you been seeing happening?
[03:26:43.683 --> 03:26:46.646]  Well, right now I'm at 6th Avenue and Wood Street.
[03:26:47.493 --> 03:26:55.638]  And basically what they're doing is, as we move block by block, they collapse, you know, the group of police officers.
[03:26:55.638 --> 03:27:03.482]  And right now it's about a hundred foot deep of police officers basically pushing the marchers to some undisclosed location, I guess.
[03:27:03.482 --> 03:27:11.166]  So as I said, as I said, they've now gotten behind you, they're gonna be waiting in front and block you off all at one spot.
[03:27:11.166 --> 03:27:13.187]  Right, that is exactly what they're doing.
[03:27:13.187 --> 03:27:16.029]  Every time I get to a new block, there's another collapse of soldiers.
[03:27:16.878 --> 03:27:22.640]  And, um, yeah, trying to... Yeah, Burmas said that there are army there.
[03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:23.820]  Obviously we haven't seen it.
[03:27:23.820 --> 03:27:31.443]  Have you seen the video of snatch and grab teams grabbing peaceful demonstrators and shoving them in police cars with the army driving them and driving them away?
[03:27:32.857 --> 03:27:34.418]  I haven't seen any video of it.
[03:27:34.418 --> 03:27:35.598]  I've seen paddy wagons.
[03:27:35.598 --> 03:27:38.539]  I've seen them, you know, zoom away through the crowd.
[03:27:38.539 --> 03:27:40.759]  Well, obviously you're on the ground so you can't see the video.
[03:27:40.759 --> 03:27:43.360]  What I'm telling you is we're here seeing it all.
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:46.361]  That's why I stayed here at the command center so we can kind of coordinate.
[03:27:46.361 --> 03:27:49.022]  You know, there's got to be a general here in our little operation.
[03:27:49.022 --> 03:27:51.283]  I wish I was there with you.
[03:27:51.283 --> 03:27:59.105]  Like I said, I've seen the paddy wagons come in and then zoom away, but I haven't seen, you know, with my own eyes and been able to capture it on video.
[03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:06.705]  Varmus is saying he has seen them, Billy Club people, threaten the Billy Club people.
[03:28:06.705 --> 03:28:20.575]  Yep, well I was standing in front of the line in between the anarchists, or supposed anarchists, and the military line, and they all had rifles, and then for some reason, I can't figure out what it was, they just started pointing the rifles right in our face.
[03:28:20.575 --> 03:28:25.479]  I had a tear gas, you know, two inches from my face.
[03:28:25.479 --> 03:28:27.840]  You're telling me that they were pointing
[03:28:28.875 --> 03:28:29.656]  Rifles?
[03:28:29.656 --> 03:28:32.297]  They look like shotguns?
[03:28:32.297 --> 03:28:36.099]  Yeah, you know, it looked bigger than a shotgun.
[03:28:36.099 --> 03:28:37.961]  It looked like a grenade launcher is what it looked like.
[03:28:37.961 --> 03:28:41.883]  That's probably a big tear gas launcher, or those can kill you up close.
[03:28:41.883 --> 03:28:44.425]  Remember the Red Sox?
[03:28:44.425 --> 03:28:49.508]  They killed some girl, walked out of a bar, and they shot her at 10 feet in the eye, and it pushed her eye back in her brain.
[03:28:49.508 --> 03:28:53.490]  You have video of them, just for no reason, aiming the weapons at you.
[03:28:53.490 --> 03:28:58.213]  You know, I don't know what I got exactly, because I was right in the middle of changing tapes when that happened.
[03:28:58.932 --> 03:29:07.931]  And I slammed the cape in and I pressed record as fast as I could, but I also wet myself a little bit, so... It was pretty intense.
[03:29:08.951 --> 03:29:11.553]  Did you really bite yourself, Douglas?
[03:29:11.553 --> 03:29:12.273]  No, not really.
[03:29:12.273 --> 03:29:13.875]  You mean figuratively?
[03:29:13.875 --> 03:29:19.419]  You know, all of a sudden they got very aggressive and started moving towards us and pointing weapons.
[03:29:19.419 --> 03:29:21.620]  And I personally have never had anything that big.
[03:29:21.620 --> 03:29:23.322]  Well, that's what Burma said.
[03:29:23.322 --> 03:29:28.706]  He said just some woman stepped up on the sidewalk and the guy took a billy club and said, I'll smash your teeth in, whore!
[03:29:29.386 --> 03:29:33.267]  You know, basically, uh, and we've seen videos of that, but we can't play it here.
[03:29:33.267 --> 03:29:43.311]  We're playing them without audio, because it's cops cussing, citizens cussing, people just are videotaping a cop, and you see him, the cop goes, I'm about to beat the hell out of you, bitch.
[03:29:43.311 --> 03:29:46.612]  You know, it is, and he adds a few things we can't say on air.
[03:29:46.612 --> 03:29:47.153]  Stay there.
[03:29:47.153 --> 03:29:51.714]  Final report from you, straight ahead.
[03:29:51.714 --> 03:29:53.115]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.115 --> 03:29:55.636]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.636 --> 03:29:58.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.223 --> 03:30:05.447]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.447 --> 03:30:07.449]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.449 --> 03:30:15.978]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.978 --> 03:30:21.543]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.543 --> 03:30:23.145]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.385 --> 03:30:29.909]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.909 --> 03:30:40.956]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.956 --> 03:30:42.337]  That's right, clean water.
[03:30:42.597 --> 03:30:42.998]  We're good to go.
[03:31:04.520 --> 03:31:08.022]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[03:31:08.022 --> 03:31:10.343]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[03:31:10.343 --> 03:31:18.688]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.688 --> 03:31:26.131]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.131 --> 03:31:32.975]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[03:31:33.502 --> 03:31:37.864]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:37.864 --> 03:31:41.825]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.825 --> 03:31:44.086]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.086 --> 03:31:48.528]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:32:01.249 --> 03:32:04.432]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[03:32:04.432 --> 03:32:08.195]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[03:32:08.195 --> 03:32:11.058]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[03:32:11.058 --> 03:32:15.702]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[03:32:15.702 --> 03:32:20.206]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[03:32:20.206 --> 03:32:22.088]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[03:32:22.188 --> 03:32:22.708]  We're good to go!
[03:32:41.741 --> 03:32:41.961]  We're good.
[03:33:13.325 --> 03:33:14.866]  We've got our people on the ground.
[03:33:14.866 --> 03:33:16.687]  Rob Dew, Jason Douglas, Jason Burmess.
[03:33:16.687 --> 03:33:17.848]  They're coming back tomorrow.
[03:33:17.848 --> 03:33:23.872]  Full report for you in studio Sunday with exclusive video as well that our team has shot.
[03:33:23.872 --> 03:33:28.895]  We've never had Dew on these days except for when the military tried to set you guys up.
[03:33:29.395 --> 03:33:40.858]  Wednesday night, but he was saying he was up on a rooftop while Luke Rudowsky was bullhorning him Then they hit the crowd yesterday with a sound weapon and Luke tried to hold his ground for a while did a great job And everybody dispersed.
[03:33:40.858 --> 03:33:55.281]  I mean this is like out of a science fiction dystopic novel Douglas I hear the sound weapon Douglas
[03:33:57.782 --> 03:34:01.003]  Douglas, this is like something out of a science fiction movie.
[03:34:01.003 --> 03:34:02.363]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:34:02.363 --> 03:34:10.145]  I mean, there was a band playing the Imperial song, the Imperial Stormtrooper song, and it was so apropos.
[03:34:10.145 --> 03:34:11.386]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:34:11.386 --> 03:34:15.587]  The only thing that's not the same is that they're all in different uniforms.
[03:34:15.587 --> 03:34:21.128]  It's people from all over the country, police from all over the country, and National Guard.
[03:34:21.128 --> 03:34:23.769]  But, you know, they all look like Stormtroopers.
[03:34:23.769 --> 03:34:24.589]  And Border Patrol?
[03:34:25.788 --> 03:34:32.149]  And Border Patrol, Homeland Security, I mean, too many to even name.
[03:34:32.149 --> 03:34:33.210]  Well, it's incredible.
[03:34:33.210 --> 03:34:37.091]  Any closing thoughts?
[03:34:37.091 --> 03:34:39.551]  You know, I just can't believe that this is happening.
[03:34:39.551 --> 03:34:48.073]  It's like, they give us five seconds to talk, and then they push us, and then they corral us onto this bridge right now.
[03:34:49.446 --> 03:34:51.607]  I'm just not sure about the state of this country anymore.
[03:34:51.607 --> 03:34:59.214]  Was it you or Burmese that said that they had one permitted march yesterday and they wouldn't even allow them to march?
[03:34:59.214 --> 03:35:05.740]  The permitted march was on the 20th and they didn't allow it to go all the way down to the convention center.
[03:35:05.740 --> 03:35:08.362]  This is the closest we've gotten to the convention center.
[03:35:08.362 --> 03:35:09.704]  I can see it right now.
[03:35:09.704 --> 03:35:11.125]  It's about a block and a half away.
[03:35:12.586 --> 03:35:18.912]  Of course, there's about six metal fences and about 500 tubes in between us and the convention center.
[03:35:18.912 --> 03:35:21.154]  Okay, I'm going to be here all day.
[03:35:21.154 --> 03:35:22.415]  If anything happens, call us.
[03:35:22.415 --> 03:35:27.119]  We'll go live on the video, audio streams at InfoWars.com, not on the full radio show.
[03:35:27.119 --> 03:35:28.220]  Wish we could, but we can't.
[03:35:28.220 --> 03:35:33.045]  Stations, affiliates only have us at set times, obviously, for the way radio programming works.
[03:35:33.045 --> 03:35:33.926]  But we'll go live.
[03:35:33.926 --> 03:35:35.888]  People, just watch InfoWars for that.
[03:35:36.748 --> 03:35:40.111]  If that happens, we may even put the PrisonPlanet.tv stream out for free.
[03:35:40.111 --> 03:35:46.295]  We can't afford that for more than a day or so, but we'll put the video stream out if things continue to develop.
[03:35:46.295 --> 03:35:49.197]  Thank you so much, Jason Douglas, for the great job you're doing.
[03:35:49.197 --> 03:35:49.718]  Keep it up.
[03:35:49.718 --> 03:35:50.578]  Be careful.
[03:35:50.578 --> 03:35:52.980]  Get out of there if they start attacking everybody.
[03:35:52.980 --> 03:35:54.981]  The mission is get the video out and stay safe.
[03:35:54.981 --> 03:35:55.542]  God bless you.
[03:35:58.629 --> 03:35:59.350]  Thank you.
[03:35:59.350 --> 03:36:00.650]  Let's go to a final comment.
[03:36:00.650 --> 03:36:08.336]  We're going to Bob Chapman for the balance of the hour with more economic news on the global government announcing world tax and the end of the dollar.
[03:36:08.336 --> 03:36:09.637]  Varmus, any closing comments?
[03:36:15.247 --> 03:36:15.907]  We're good to go.
[03:36:41.457 --> 03:36:42.098]  We're good to go.
[03:36:51.738 --> 03:36:57.122]  Well, Jason, you know they're using those dogs like in South Africa or Nazi Germany for intimidation.
[03:36:57.122 --> 03:37:05.208]  They bring them into schools and have them snap at kids and bite at them as they did in Goose Creek, North Carolina, famously.
[03:37:05.208 --> 03:37:06.649]  Look for an exit out of there.
[03:37:06.649 --> 03:37:13.294]  Why don't you get out of the crowd before they lock down and rubber bullet and sound cannon everybody because they have a bloodlust for the American people.
[03:37:13.294 --> 03:37:15.876]  We've got, as you said, photos and videos.
[03:37:16.536 --> 03:37:18.437]  We just sent Rob to get Aaron out of bed.
[03:37:18.437 --> 03:37:19.738]  He worked too late last night.
[03:37:19.738 --> 03:37:20.679]  Aaron has it last night.
[03:37:20.679 --> 03:37:21.460]  I saw it.
[03:37:21.460 --> 03:37:23.962]  So we can try to get it at the end of the show.
[03:37:23.962 --> 03:37:32.368]  But if they're rolling around, well you said you saw this too yesterday, them just going through empty neighborhoods sound canoning, broadcasting that nobody's allowed to be on the streets.
[03:37:33.442 --> 03:37:37.866]  Well, yeah, uh, you know, they were, again, they did such a great job of dispersing people.
[03:37:37.866 --> 03:37:50.618]  There would literally be 15 or 20 people coming down the street, uh, you know, and then there'd be 10 or 15 people just out on their porches who want nothing to do with this protest, and that doesn't stop them from using the LRAD.
[03:37:50.618 --> 03:37:55.382]  It's unbelievable, it's inconceivable, yet it's true.
[03:37:55.382 --> 03:37:57.264]  It's really starting to get loud now, Alex.
[03:37:57.264 --> 03:37:58.745]  They're consolidating us big time.
[03:37:58.745 --> 03:37:59.646]  I'm sure you can hear it.
[03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:02.010]  You got it!
[03:38:02.010 --> 03:38:02.390]  Alright, sounds good!
[03:38:19.158 --> 03:38:20.600]  Well, that is crazy.
[03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:25.225]  In fact, maybe from time to time you just fade up the background while Bob Chapman's talking so people can hear this.
[03:38:25.225 --> 03:38:32.312]  Bob Chapman, you fought the Communists in Europe in military intelligence in Berlin.
[03:38:32.312 --> 03:38:36.036]  We have a video that we broke a month ago that's finally made national news.
[03:38:36.036 --> 03:38:37.118]  It's all over Fox, CNN.
[03:38:38.579 --> 03:38:41.260]  In fact, cue that up with the little kids worshiping Obama.
[03:38:41.260 --> 03:38:51.522]  And they said this line about, instead of Jesus loves all the little children, they say this poem, and then they sing another song about red, yellow, black, and white, they are all equal in his sight.
[03:38:51.522 --> 03:38:56.563]  Well, they say they're all equal in Obama's sight, then they sing the song, this is directly out of North Korea.
[03:38:56.563 --> 03:39:01.184]  This is worse than Hitler, worse than Stalin, worse than Mao.
[03:39:01.184 --> 03:39:07.546]  Paul Watson's girlfriend, who was born in China, she got really freaked out when she saw this, because she's a patriot.
[03:39:08.146 --> 03:39:13.828]  And she said that's what we had to do to Mal when I was a little girl, was worship him and sing songs about him.
[03:39:13.828 --> 03:39:17.550]  I mean, this is getting really sick, Bob Chapman.
[03:39:17.550 --> 03:39:31.916]  Well, I think the program is accelerating and the reason it is, is because we've accelerated and we have informed the public and more and more people are catching on and so that's why they're doing what they're doing.
[03:39:31.916 --> 03:39:33.197]  I think what's going to come out of this
[03:39:34.595 --> 03:39:39.298]  G20 meeting, more than anything else, is things that they're not talking about.
[03:39:39.298 --> 03:39:46.382]  And that is setting the government and the financial system up for a fall.
[03:39:46.382 --> 03:39:49.104]  It's hard to tell what date they're going to pick.
[03:39:49.104 --> 03:39:50.645]  It could be in three months.
[03:39:50.645 --> 03:39:53.066]  It could be in a year and a half.
[03:39:53.066 --> 03:39:54.407]  You know, they have their own schedule.
[03:39:54.407 --> 03:40:03.633]  Yeah, they're meeting, scheming to engineer an even bigger implosion, as they've admitted in the past, that then poses the saviors, saying, give us even more power or we'll have martial law.
[03:40:05.123 --> 03:40:12.867]  You know, if they have martial law, I don't know who's going to do it, because the lower and the middle echelons of the military all know what's going on.
[03:40:12.867 --> 03:40:14.788]  Bob, I don't know, though.
[03:40:14.788 --> 03:40:28.194]  I know a lot of them are awake, evidenced by Ron Paul getting more contributions than any other political candidate in 2008, but these cops and military seem to enjoy beating the hell out of women, especially, for no reason, and L-ratting small children.
[03:40:28.194 --> 03:40:32.316]  I mean, it seems like they want to destroy their country.
[03:40:32.316 --> 03:40:34.197]  Well, I'm sure there's always some who will.
[03:40:34.881 --> 03:40:40.263]  And perhaps they were chosen to do the work that they're doing because of their viciousness.
[03:40:40.263 --> 03:40:40.883]  I don't know.
[03:40:40.883 --> 03:40:52.307]  I know that the average military person does not want to go around beating people up, particularly women, and doing things which are unlawful.
[03:40:52.307 --> 03:40:58.389]  And I think we're going to get a lot of support from the military, and I think this may end up as a military coup.
[03:41:00.825 --> 03:41:06.169]  Well, Bob, let's, and then I'm going to play this Children Worshipping Obama clip.
[03:41:06.169 --> 03:41:08.331]  I played it a month ago, but again, now it's national news.
[03:41:08.331 --> 03:41:10.112]  People are emailing saying, why aren't you covering it?
[03:41:10.112 --> 03:41:11.333]  Uh, because we broke it.
[03:41:11.333 --> 03:41:13.395]  Like, I get emails saying, why haven't you covered MYAC?
[03:41:13.395 --> 03:41:13.955]  Uh, we broke it.
[03:41:13.955 --> 03:41:24.023]  I'm not bragging, it's just that that's an example of how this radio show, pretty much more than any other outlet now, but with a lot of other great folks as well, is now driving the news.
[03:41:24.023 --> 03:41:28.267]  What we break and cover, weeks later, months later, is then covered by the mainstream media.
[03:41:28.607 --> 03:41:33.930]  That shows the power of this audience.
[03:41:33.930 --> 03:41:48.219]  It certainly does, and it is a powerful audience, and it's up to them to keep on doing what they're doing, and getting to everybody in America, and informing them who the enemy of all the people is, not some political party.
[03:41:48.219 --> 03:41:56.344]  We have to all come together, and that's in every country, because everybody is experiencing the same thing in countries throughout the world.
[03:41:57.108 --> 03:41:59.670]  And so, we got to make this thing stick.
[03:41:59.670 --> 03:42:06.935]  And the more people who know who the enemy is, the least chance that they have of being successful.
[03:42:06.935 --> 03:42:11.979]  Believe me, I do not believe that the military are going to work against the American people.
[03:42:13.012 --> 03:42:21.074]  But we saw these two-stage terror stings where the FBI cooked the bomb, the fake bombs in both cases, and found one lone nut idiot.
[03:42:21.074 --> 03:42:23.195]  It's probably informants, they're probably setting them up.
[03:42:23.195 --> 03:42:25.735]  We know they've done that in the past, or it could just be a mental patient.
[03:42:25.735 --> 03:42:33.477]  In the case of 93, World Trade Center, where the FBI cooking the bomb, training the drivers, and ordering their informants to stand down and let it happen.
[03:42:33.477 --> 03:42:35.818]  I think if they stage terror attacks in things, though, it might help.
[03:42:38.291 --> 03:42:41.353]  Well, you're always going to find people who are pliable for that.
[03:42:41.353 --> 03:42:56.023]  I mean, when they did the tests and the surveys some 20 years ago, they found that there were 10 to 15 percent of the military who would do heinous things.
[03:42:56.023 --> 03:42:59.625]  And you're always going to find, just like we have, criminals in society.
[03:42:59.625 --> 03:43:07.871]  Or, if you have 15 hired anarchists run up and throw some bottles at the cops, then the cops will go ahead and open up with rubber bullets.
[03:43:09.116 --> 03:43:11.501]  Well, I have a question about that, Alex.
[03:43:11.501 --> 03:43:16.130]  And the question is, do you believe that the anarchists, the supposed anarchists,
[03:43:17.097 --> 03:43:22.481]  Are being trained and put into the positions they are by the people who control our government?
[03:43:47.417 --> 03:43:51.359]  Are doing it and so but we don't know yet.
[03:43:51.359 --> 03:43:55.320]  We rarely catch him right at the time, but it always comes out later.
[03:43:55.320 --> 03:44:03.183]  In Canada people followed the police car and saw him let him out a block away and were taking their outfits off and they had police boots on and the Royal Mounted Police had to admit it.
[03:44:03.183 --> 03:44:04.624]  But yes, I've watched the video.
[03:44:05.624 --> 03:44:14.368]  And you'll have a bunch of idiot meth-head kids who are with him, maybe one-tenth of one percent of the total crowd, a few morons, because the feds go and recruit patsies, but you see it.
[03:44:14.368 --> 03:44:18.329]  These are cops and informants and state police officers that are doing this.
[03:44:18.329 --> 03:44:22.751]  And their argument is, we neutralize a dangerous crowd by creating the pretext.
[03:44:22.751 --> 03:44:26.333]  You know, it's kind of like you put out an oil well fire with a stick of dynamite.
[03:44:26.333 --> 03:44:27.733]  They say, well, we're knocking this out.
[03:44:27.733 --> 03:44:29.234]  These protests are dangerous.
[03:44:29.234 --> 03:44:30.715]  The terror threat is real.
[03:44:30.715 --> 03:44:33.376]  Men, we've got to go out and stage an event to keep everybody safe.
[03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:40.786]  And there are those elements that will always do that.
[03:44:40.786 --> 03:44:45.773]  We have elements in society will always, you know, do those kind of things.
[03:44:45.773 --> 03:44:47.195]  And so we have to expect it.
[03:44:48.013 --> 03:44:55.799]  And I, you know, I've listened to you talk about this before, but I wanted to bring that fact out to put it in people's minds up front.
[03:44:55.799 --> 03:44:58.281]  If you hadn't mentioned it earlier, and I don't know whether you had.
[03:44:58.281 --> 03:44:58.961]  No, I don't think I have.
[03:44:58.961 --> 03:45:09.710]  The point is, we gotta know that this, the public has gotta know that this anarchist reaction that you see all over the media right now, they're not calling him terrorist anymore, they're anarchist.
[03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:12.091]  It's all planned that way.
[03:45:12.091 --> 03:45:14.853]  It's all propaganda.
[03:45:14.853 --> 03:45:15.034]  Well,
[03:45:16.164 --> 03:45:36.071]  The police herd everybody to a certain spot, then the anarchists come out then, turn over a trash can, throw a rock, and then the anarchists always pull back, the police wait, you'll even see anarchists, and we've caught this on tape, you know, they'll do a hand signal, and then they move back and the cops open fire.
[03:45:36.071 --> 03:45:37.411]  That's right.
[03:45:37.411 --> 03:45:40.932]  So we want the public to know that, that this is all planned.
[03:45:40.932 --> 03:45:43.253]  It's planned by the power behind our government.
[03:45:44.189 --> 03:45:47.520]  Well, they want to delegitimize all these tens of thousands of peaceful people.
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:49.768]  They do it with a handful of scum!
[03:45:49.768 --> 03:45:50.250]  And, uh...
[03:45:51.334 --> 03:45:52.274]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:45:52.274 --> 03:45:55.396]  What would the police and the corrupt system do without the anarchist thugs?
[03:45:55.396 --> 03:46:02.159]  They would have to attack people that had done nothing, and then Hitler staged an attack on his own base to attack Poland.
[03:46:02.159 --> 03:46:04.080]  Operation Northwoods, the same deal.
[03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:05.521]  Operation Glywoods.
[03:46:05.521 --> 03:46:06.521]  Operation Ajax.
[03:46:06.521 --> 03:46:07.622]  It's declassified.
[03:46:07.622 --> 03:46:10.223]  I want to play this worship piece of Obama.
[03:46:10.223 --> 03:46:15.266]  Then I want to come back and get into a little bit on the economy, what you see happening in the next few months and the year with the G20.
[03:46:16.963 --> 03:46:18.584]  And why they're announcing their world government.
[03:46:18.584 --> 03:46:33.535]  But here is one of many videos, the kids are wearing uniforms in some videos, chanting, city year in military outfits, red and black uniforms, climate cops, Boy Scouts trained to spy on their parents in a quote, take on disgruntled veterans, New York Times, it's all happening.
[03:46:33.535 --> 03:46:38.079]  But here are the children literally worshipping Obama like we're North Korea.
[03:46:41.879 --> 03:46:51.843]  Barack Hussein Obama, he said we're all gonna stand together to make this country strong again.
[03:46:51.843 --> 03:46:59.586]  Barack Hussein Obama, he said it comes from here today, people working equal pay.
[03:46:59.586 --> 03:47:08.290]  Barack Hussein Obama, he said everyone will take a stand to make sure everyone gets a chance.
[03:47:09.711 --> 03:47:15.033]  Did you hear that?
[03:47:15.033 --> 03:47:16.833]  Hit pause.
[03:47:16.833 --> 03:47:19.734]  Did you hear that quote?
[03:47:30.117 --> 03:47:30.417]  Absolutely.
[03:47:30.417 --> 03:47:31.798]  It's mind-boggling and it's mind-washing.
[03:47:59.674 --> 03:48:02.416]  What do we do about this?
[03:48:02.416 --> 03:48:04.657]  All we can do is expose it.
[03:48:04.657 --> 03:48:07.899]  I mean, Congress won't do anything.
[03:48:07.899 --> 03:48:10.080]  The Senate won't do anything.
[03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:14.643]  And we'll have to do the best we can until the die is cast.
[03:48:14.643 --> 03:48:18.105]  And when that happens, the whole thing's going to blow sky high.
[03:48:18.105 --> 03:48:19.606]  And it won't only be in America.
[03:48:19.606 --> 03:48:21.367]  It's going to happen all over the world.
[03:48:22.148 --> 03:48:24.049]  Well, I mean, this is classical tyranny.
[03:48:24.049 --> 03:48:35.417]  They're hitting on all cylinders, secret police, militarized police, saying you can't march or demonstrate, attacking people, provocateurs, open world government, foreign banks looting us.
[03:48:35.417 --> 03:48:40.280]  Bob Chapman, I mean, there are openly 8,000 plus articles today in Google News.
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:47.485]  Today, 8,000 newspapers are reporting world government is here and how wonderful it is, and that Obama is now president of the planet.
[03:48:49.778 --> 03:49:00.346]  And that will continue, because they own the media, and we're fighting them from the other side, and it's not going to stop.
[03:49:00.346 --> 03:49:03.028]  And you know, it's just like with the financial thing.
[03:49:03.028 --> 03:49:05.610]  We don't know when they're going to pull the plug, but they're going to pull it.
[03:49:05.610 --> 03:49:10.314]  We also know that they're going to use biological warfare
[03:49:11.164 --> 03:49:21.410]  To, uh, what would I call it, pacify the people so they won't run and get the gun to defend themselves, that they'll just sit around and wait for somebody to collect them.
[03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:23.531]  Because they're ill.
[03:49:23.531 --> 03:49:27.453]  That's right, it's a perfect soft kill operation to make everybody stand down.
[03:49:27.453 --> 03:49:34.737]  But the police and military that don't know what the new order means for them, they are always the most preyed upon group once the takeover has happened.
[03:49:36.328 --> 03:49:44.692]  Well, just to go back to what Henry Kissinger said, generally paraphrasing him, they're dumb animals, you know?
[03:49:44.692 --> 03:49:47.353]  They're cannon fodder.
[03:49:47.353 --> 03:49:51.854]  Yeah, he said military men are dumb animals and published it!
[03:49:51.854 --> 03:49:56.176]  Well, I just showed you the disdain and arrogance that they have.
[03:49:56.176 --> 03:49:58.297]  You know, let me tell you something.
[03:49:58.297 --> 03:50:02.439]  No matter what happens to people, they're not going to make it.
[03:50:02.439 --> 03:50:04.840]  The people behind the scenes who are causing this.
[03:50:05.609 --> 03:50:12.935]  It's just that we're going to pay a terrible price as humanity because we wouldn't listen, generally speaking.
[03:50:12.935 --> 03:50:15.317]  And, uh, they're going to lose.
[03:50:15.317 --> 03:50:24.765]  Because people will, there are certain people, and all we need is 5 to 10 percent of the population, who refuse to live on their knees.
[03:50:24.765 --> 03:50:29.008]  We're going to go out with a battle hymn of the republic with the children worshipping Obama.
[03:50:29.008 --> 03:50:32.311]  With his name in place of the republic, we'll come back with Bob Chapman on the economy.
[03:51:01.924 --> 03:51:03.225]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:03.225 --> 03:51:08.809]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:13.833]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:51:13.833 --> 03:51:19.417]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:51:19.417 --> 03:51:24.101]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:51:24.619 --> 03:51:31.743]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[03:51:31.743 --> 03:51:32.843]  And here's the best part.
[03:51:32.843 --> 03:51:35.925]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:51:35.925 --> 03:51:39.547]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:51:39.547 --> 03:51:42.729]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:42.729 --> 03:51:45.890]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:51:45.890 --> 03:51:46.091]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:51:46.091 --> 03:51:46.331]  Remember,
[03:51:54.673 --> 03:51:58.575]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:51:58.575 --> 03:52:02.338]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:52:02.338 --> 03:52:08.161]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.161 --> 03:52:15.746]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.746 --> 03:52:21.890]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.310 --> 03:52:24.291]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.291 --> 03:52:26.793]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.793 --> 03:52:38.359]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.359 --> 03:52:40.040]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:41.901]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.901 --> 03:52:48.125]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:53:01.684 --> 03:53:07.569]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:53:07.569 --> 03:53:12.692]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:53:12.692 --> 03:53:13.913]  That was then.
[03:53:13.913 --> 03:53:15.214]  This is now.
[03:53:15.214 --> 03:53:17.396]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:53:17.916 --> 03:53:23.980]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:53:23.980 --> 03:53:33.186]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:53:33.186 --> 03:53:35.928]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:53:36.648 --> 03:53:41.133]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:53:41.133 --> 03:53:42.655]  Video never lies.
[03:53:42.655 --> 03:53:44.317]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:54:27.319 --> 03:54:29.081]  It's the G20 World Government being announced.

[03:54:56.746 --> 03:54:58.648]  You can read the description of the film.
[03:54:58.648 --> 03:55:03.993]  It's all going up in the online shopping cart at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com the next hour.

[03:55:11.060 --> 03:55:13.022]  That's Falloftherepublic.com.
[03:55:15.816 --> 03:55:19.177]  Bob Chapman, in closing, the economy.
[03:55:19.177 --> 03:55:20.078]  Things aren't going well.
[03:55:20.078 --> 03:55:23.379]  They're starting to drop their takeover of health care.
[03:55:23.379 --> 03:55:25.200]  Their entire agenda is stalling.
[03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:27.621]  Do you think they're going to stage terror attacks?
[03:55:27.621 --> 03:55:29.602]  What is the establishment going to do?
[03:55:29.602 --> 03:55:32.363]  And what do you see happening in the economy?
[03:55:32.363 --> 03:55:43.848]  Well, they have the problems that you just mentioned, cap and trade as well, which they're pushing very hard now with the President's speech, as well as Clinton getting up there and running around on his hind legs.
[03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:54.049]  And next, we've got the turmoil that's going to occur during the month of October from the swine flu situation.
[03:55:54.049 --> 03:55:55.971]  I hope you got my email.
[03:55:55.971 --> 03:56:02.597]  And also, we're going to have the dollar down at around 71.18 in the USDX.
[03:56:02.597 --> 03:56:03.758]  It's currently around 77.
[03:56:03.758 --> 03:56:06.441]  And what's going to happen
[03:56:09.133 --> 03:56:26.832]  Is that they're going to tell you and they are in the process of doing so that they're going to start removing all of this money and credit that they have injected into the system and that cannot happen without the entire economy collapsing.
[03:56:26.832 --> 03:56:29.055]  And so I don't think they're ready yet.
[03:56:29.716 --> 03:56:30.556]  To go for it.
[03:56:30.556 --> 03:56:34.138]  It's going to happen in probably in the next year and a half.
[03:56:34.138 --> 03:56:40.401]  I don't know when, but I don't think it's quite... So it's kind of like the hesitation at the edge of a 200 foot cliff about to jump into the water.
[03:56:40.401 --> 03:56:44.863]  They're kind of hesitating, getting everybody ready, sending up trial balloons.
[03:56:44.863 --> 03:56:50.345]  Tell people what it will look like if the dollar is dumped.
[03:56:50.345 --> 03:56:52.266]  There will be an official devaluation.
[03:56:53.175 --> 03:56:53.656]  I think?
[03:57:12.430 --> 03:57:18.373]  And they will probably chop off two-thirds of the debt, and the debtors will pay back one-third.
[03:57:18.373 --> 03:57:23.095]  How that will affect individuals within individual economies, I don't know.
[03:57:23.095 --> 03:57:32.439]  I know what the logical thing to do is, but goodness knows they may not use the logical thing, which is to reduce debt by the same amount, domestically.
[03:57:33.656 --> 03:57:38.058]  And that's what we got coming as far as money and credit is concerned.
[03:57:38.058 --> 03:57:39.559]  How do you protect yourself?
[03:57:39.559 --> 03:57:40.679]  You gotta be in gold.
[03:57:40.679 --> 03:57:41.820]  It's the only place.
[03:57:41.820 --> 03:57:43.581]  Gold and silver.
[03:57:43.581 --> 03:57:46.362]  But what you said is key for laymen that don't understand.
[03:57:46.362 --> 03:57:51.405]  Institutions and big globalist groups are gonna have their debt forgiven and a devaluation of currency.
[03:57:51.405 --> 03:58:00.229]  But they're probably gonna keep all the maximum debts on us, keep increasing taxes, and just Billy Club it out of us like the Sheriff of Nottingham in the days of Robin Hood.
[03:58:01.796 --> 03:58:02.536]  Absolutely.
[03:58:02.536 --> 03:58:05.418]  That's probably the way they'll go.
[03:58:05.418 --> 03:58:10.560]  And the people are in for it and the police are being brainwashed like attack dogs against us right now.
[03:58:10.560 --> 03:58:12.381]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:58:12.381 --> 03:58:17.023]  We'll link to this big breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com on the flu that Bob was just telling you about.
[03:58:17.023 --> 03:58:19.784]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:58:19.784 --> 03:58:23.146]  Thank you for having me and thank everybody for listening.
[03:58:23.146 --> 03:58:23.486]  You bet.

[03:58:27.092 --> 03:58:28.253]  It's excellent.

[03:58:30.673 --> 03:58:33.034]  It's going up in the next hour at InfoWars.com.

[03:58:35.555 --> 03:58:39.657]  Retransmission with Dave Mustaine and a lot more coming up right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:39.657 --> 03:58:43.159]  Great job, crew.

[03:58:51.161 --> 03:58:54.543]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.543 --> 03:58:58.145]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.145 --> 03:59:02.727]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.727 --> 03:59:08.330]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.610 --> 03:59:13.373]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.373 --> 03:59:17.015]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.015 --> 03:59:21.817]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.817 --> 03:59:28.381]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.381 --> 03:59:30.342]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.822 --> 03:59:34.023]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
