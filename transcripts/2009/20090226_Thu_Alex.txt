[00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.474]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.862]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.772]  Well, I've just got him for about twenty minutes or so, then we're going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:30.000]  He is State Representative Charles Key, and he has gotten it passed out of their house, a resolution, a very strong resolution, declaring state independence against gun confiscation, martial law.
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.023]  We had State Senator Brogdon on yesterday.
[00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:36.384]  There's a mirror of it in the Senate.
[00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:38.986]  They have a very good chance of passing it in the Senate.
[00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:45.689]  Now a majority of states have introduced or are passing this type of legislation.
[00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.071]  I have a headline up on Infowars.com covering that right now.
[00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:54.973]  So, Representative Charles Keith, thank you for what you're doing and thank you for joining us with an update.
[00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.234]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:57.734]  Good to be with you again.
[00:00:57.774 --> 00:00:58.075]  Thank you.
[00:00:58.575 --> 00:00:58.855]  You bet.
[00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.016]  Tell us what's going on.
[00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:07.459]  Well, I'm just getting flooded by emails from people all over the country and in our state and even
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.021]  A few legislators.
[00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:10.601]  The list is growing.
[00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.242]  I think it's about 30 or so now.
[00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:18.466]  And it looks like it's just going to keep growing of states that have filed a 10th Amendment resolution or something like it.
[00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:20.407]  And I'm real encouraged.
[00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:24.149]  I think things are moving in a good direction right now in our country at the state level.
[00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:39.570]  Well, that said, I'm sure you know that the Attorney General's announced they are going to introduce soon an expanded assault weapons ban, and they've got gun registration, gun bans in there, psychological federal testing.
[00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.992]  I mean, they're moving quick, so it's a good thing the states are moving to block it.
[00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:46.634]  Yes, and you know, I'm getting tired of this.
[00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:56.558]  I think what the people need to do, and I think state legislators need to do, we need to face up to the fact that we have people in office at the federal and state level
[00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:03.397]  that are violating the Supreme Law of the Land, and other laws for that matter, and we need to call them what they are.
[00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:04.518]  They're law breakers.
[00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:06.958]  They are the ones that are breaking the law.
[00:02:07.838 --> 00:02:09.179]  No one wants to really say that.
[00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:24.342]  I don't find any great pleasure in saying that, in addressing this problem in this way, but I think it's time that we do that, because we can't continue to give ground away to those that will violate the Supreme Law of the Land
[00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:34.541]  and put up laws that are in violation of it and really are no laws at all you can't have a supreme law of the land that says and lays out what every
[00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:43.389]  level of government and individuals within the government can and cannot do, and then allow those individuals to then violate that and just make it up as they go along.
[00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.310]  Well, we know what they're doing.
[00:02:45.570 --> 00:03:00.658]  We know in the Jesse Trinidad murder case, we have via the lawsuits, this is made national news, his internal memos that the Attorney General, his Deputy Attorney General under Clinton, covering up and saying this is a national security matter, this OKC thing,
[00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.459]  We've got to pull out all the stops.
[00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.160]  This is like a D-Day operation.
[00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.042]  This is national security, highest level.
[00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:08.603]  We've got to cover this up.
[00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.665]  Now, this is a really nasty character.
[00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:14.768]  Well, you know, we can fix these problems in this country.
[00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:18.070]  There's so many examples in Oklahoma City bombing cases.
[00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.475]  A very good one to thank God for Jesse Trinidad and people like him that won't let go and they keep fighting this thing and dig more and more evidence out.
[00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:30.659]  But there's more than enough evidence for the people to see that their government is out of control.
[00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:35.031]  You know, the difficulty is knowing that there's a lot of good people in government.
[00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.533]  There are, and probably a lot more than there are good.
[00:03:37.553 --> 00:03:38.714]  There's no question about that.
[00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:51.145]  But you keep putting these pieces in place of laws and regulations and the bad players in the government, and you allow an opportunity for people to take advantage of it.
[00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:56.410]  You know, I heard a guy on a radio show that was a call-in just a few days ago, and he was talking about
[00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:59.805]  His father-in-law, who was born in 1900, died in 1999.
[00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:02.187]  He was 99 years old.
[00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:06.790]  German, lived in Germany all of his life, lived through both World Wars.
[00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:20.880]  And his son-in-law was asking him, as the son-in-law was doing a doctorate and putting a paper together, he interviewed him for that paper that he was preparing, and he asked him what it was like between the two World Wars, World War I and World War II.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.344]  And among some of the things he said, he said that the father, who was an attorney, by the
[00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:41.605]  He said, you know, people knew it was coming, but what happened is once they got all these little, they took all these little incremental steps and got these laws in place, it made it very, very difficult, almost impossible to stop it, because people allowed it to happen step by step.
[00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:54.308]  And it's easy for us to think in a defeatist way, and sometimes we as Christians will even think, well, it says in the Bible that in the end times this, that, or the other, you know, whatever scenario, whatever interpretation.
[00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:55.826]  I think so.
[00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:19.434]  Without any kind of violent action needing or having to be taken later on down the road.
[00:05:19.494 --> 00:05:20.095]  And I agree.
[00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:25.398]  The United States really is the only place ever that had, you know, the closest you can get to true freedom and liberty.
[00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.601]  And it had never been done before and we did it here and look how it's just more dirt.
[00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:34.565]  This country doesn't have that much resources compared to Mexico or other places that are enslaved.
[00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:43.131]  It was because that spirit of liberty and that trailblazing idea and that idea that of entrepreneurial spirit and so many other things that
[00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:58.144]  That adventure spirit that this country became so wealthy so all the evil moved here to take over that engine and now they've done that they're trying to secure the robbery, the hijacking they've committed and they're so openly criminal.
[00:05:58.164 --> 00:06:01.588]  I mean it's turning out that most of Obama's administration just doesn't even pay taxes.
[00:06:02.523 --> 00:06:06.604]  And that is his Chief of Staff and the head of the Treasury, and they just don't care.
[00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:12.346]  And they're openly setting up youth brigades and spy forces in FEMA camps.
[00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:16.007]  I mean, but thank God the states are moving to block it.
[00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:20.409]  And if the people get excited about this and take action, there's nothing that can really stop us.
[00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:27.251]  Well, and here's what I think is another point of information that should be encouraging to people.
[00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:31.012]  And if they will take advantage of it, it can pay a lot of dividends.
[00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:40.609]  The fact that there's a lot of good state legislators out there, some of them are more knowledgeable than what we think or know, and some of them are not, but they're pretty good people.
[00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:58.933]  And if people will go and educate them, will communicate with them, or just give them the support in a lot of cases, give them the support, let them know you're there, and that you want them to take these actions like oppose Real ID Act and other things like that, support constitutional legislation.
[00:06:59.597 --> 00:07:00.858]  And a return to the Constitution.
[00:07:01.238 --> 00:07:04.680]  They will stand up and do that if people will just back them up.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.902]  Exactly what happened is good people stood down and said, oh, America's fine.
[00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:09.682]  We won World War II.
[00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:10.422]  We're the good guys.
[00:07:10.442 --> 00:07:11.643]  And then the evil just took over.
[00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:17.206]  If we just stop sucking our thumbs and stop saying it's too big a problem and having this defeatist attitude,
[00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:19.207]  We can't take things back.
[00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:24.149]  But if we don't, folks, some of the worst criminals in history are now in control of our society.
[00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:25.569]  Foreign banks are openly looting us.
[00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.370]  And now, we've got you here today.
[00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.551]  You got the resolution passed in the House.
[00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:30.831]  Tell us how that fight went.
[00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.993]  And then now it's going to the Senate and the State Senator, your colleague,
[00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:37.814]  He told me yesterday on air that it looks like it's got a good chance of passing.
[00:07:38.254 --> 00:07:44.917]  So tell us how that process of passing state sovereignty declaration, what's in it, and then now where it's going, how we carry it.
[00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:50.279]  We've got the ball down to the one yard line and we've got one down here.
[00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.140]  How do we get across it?
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.541]  Well, here in Oklahoma it's in good hands over the Senate with Senator Brogdon.
[00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:58.863]  He's going to punch it on over the goal line over there and then it's done.
[00:07:59.343 --> 00:08:01.444]  And I think that's going to happen in the next couple of weeks.
[00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.072]  Um, and we'll probably be the first state to pass it out of both bodies.
[00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:08.614]  Um, so it's moving down the road real well.
[00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:15.439]  We captured, the Republicans captured the Senate, so that puts us in a much better position to be able to pass legislation like this.
[00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:20.342]  People are becoming more aware and informed, and I'm talking again about legislators.
[00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:30.389]  Um, the people here in Oklahoma, there's some organizations that have come together and just individuals that have come out to, you know, lobby and inform their legislators about
[00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:43.320]  They're interested in the 10th Amendment resolution and other legislation that they're either for or against because it's protecting their rights or it's opposing laws that are bad for their constitutional rights.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.482]  And those groups have become pretty powerful here in Oklahoma.
[00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:49.942]  I know other states can do the same thing.
[00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:50.683]  That's right.
[00:08:50.703 --> 00:08:55.324]  People just organize and we'd be willing to help them right here in Oklahoma.
[00:08:55.344 --> 00:09:00.486]  These groups, myself, there's a lot of folks that are doing a great job in Oklahoma.
[00:09:01.047 --> 00:09:09.549]  And if you don't have something going in your state, you can easily get something going and get a lot of people that think alike to come together and start lobbying your legislature.
[00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:10.309]  It'll pay off.
[00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:13.889]  Resistance is victory.
[00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:16.050]  Resistance is victory.
[00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.771]  And that's what's so scary about this is that people don't realize the power they have.
[00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:28.372]  And when I interview representatives from all over the country, I mean all over the nation, the east, the south, the west, the central states,
[00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:33.784]  I mean, these are Democrats and Republicans, and they know about the FEMA camps, and they know the bill numbers.
[00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:35.325]  They know about the PDD-51.
[00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:37.646]  They know about the gun confiscation.
[00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:38.886]  They know about the New World Order.
[00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:40.627]  They know the foreign banks are taking over.
[00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:52.072]  They know, and they tell me that the word is spreading fast, and folks, that's the cadres of leadership that now fully know we have a criminal federal government.
[00:09:53.143 --> 00:09:59.364]  And if we just put women in their sails on the good ship of liberty, we are unstoppable.
[00:09:59.404 --> 00:10:10.027]  I'm telling you, the education level's high enough now that if they pull a false flag, or whatever, to try to attack the states or, you know, pose as our saviors to bring in martial law, I don't think it's going to work.
[00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:12.227]  But the foreign banks are going for broke.
[00:10:12.247 --> 00:10:18.969]  They've engaged in so many crimes now, they've got to bring in a total police state to secure their ill-gotten gain.
[00:10:19.289 --> 00:10:20.169]  Can you speak to that, sir?
[00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:32.309]  Well, I think, again, I think if people will work at the state level with their state legislators, their House members and Senate members, that's going to pay big dividends.
[00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:39.870]  I just came out of a meeting with our assistant floor leaders, which I'm one of here in the House, and we have a weekly meeting.
[00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.951]  We review legislation and things that are going on and talk about various topics.
[00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:49.532]  And we had some good discussions about some of these kinds of issues, including the Real ID Act.
[00:10:50.413 --> 00:10:50.793]  I don't
[00:11:15.862 --> 00:11:19.165]  Okay, if that's a problem for some people, let's give them some alternatives.
[00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:25.692]  In addition to being against, like, the real ID, let's tell them what the alternative is that would be better.
[00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:28.395]  And there are some good alternatives out there.
[00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:31.538]  How about we're for the right to keep and bear arms and protect ourselves?
[00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:32.959]  We're for sovereignty.
[00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:34.881]  We're for saving the Republic.
[00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:38.344]  We're for not letting offshore banks hijack us.
[00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:39.205]  Right.
[00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.587]  Charles Key, stay with me one more segment.
[00:11:41.607 --> 00:11:55.899]  I want to come back and give out your website and again, call the listeners to put pressure on any key personnel, any key representatives, servants in the Oklahoma Senate because I'm told this vote is coming up quick and this will send shockwaves across the land.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.880]  Stay with us.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.683]  We're making history thanks to great leaders like Charles Key.

[00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:30.252]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:12:30.612 --> 00:12:32.693]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:33.193]  this fall?

[00:13:04.565 --> 00:13:10.847]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.888]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:13.843 --> 00:13:14.864]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:15.385 --> 00:13:15.885]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:17.167]  This is his ammo.
[00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:18.468]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.210]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:27.318]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:28.139]  Some U.S.
[00:13:28.179 --> 00:13:33.846]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:38.008]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:38.028 --> 00:13:40.829]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:05.197 --> 00:14:09.040]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.322]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:14.065]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:14:14.345 --> 00:14:16.867]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:19.009]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:14:19.349 --> 00:14:21.491]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:14:22.692 --> 00:14:33.137]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:37.119]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:40.260]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.922]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:14:43.022 --> 00:14:45.983]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:14:46.003 --> 00:14:46.163]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:57.269 --> 00:15:05.774]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:07.415]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.957]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:15.140]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.382]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:22.224]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:15:22.614 --> 00:15:34.621]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:37.163]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:15:37.183 --> 00:15:38.483]  I use one every day.
[00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:41.365]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:15:41.605 --> 00:15:42.326]  We're good to go.
[00:16:15.319 --> 00:16:22.645]  Our precious Second Amendment, purchased with the blood of our founders, is under total assault.
[00:16:26.088 --> 00:16:28.350]  Open socialism is being called for.
[00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:34.455]  Private banks are not nationalizing, they're hijacking through government the system.
[00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:39.898]  Your call is coming up in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[00:16:40.158 --> 00:16:44.242]  Representative Charles Key, who masterminded taking action.
[00:16:44.262 --> 00:16:45.362]  Many other states are doing it.
[00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:46.723]  It's upwards of 30 now.
[00:16:46.784 --> 00:16:48.605]  Many of them are passing or preparing to pass it.
[00:16:48.865 --> 00:16:49.666]  It's passed the House.
[00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.747]  It's now going into the Oklahoma Senate.
[00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:53.669]  Again, this will be another precedent.
[00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.051]  This will legitimize it more as we move forward.
[00:16:56.311 --> 00:16:57.792]  These are not weak resolutions.
[00:16:57.812 --> 00:17:01.515]  These are strong declarations of putting the criminals on notice.
[00:17:01.775 --> 00:17:03.277]  How do we help you get this passed, sir?
[00:17:04.187 --> 00:17:08.071]  Right now, the focus needs to be on the Oklahoma State Senate.
[00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:19.523]  If people will call or email state senators in Oklahoma, because they're going to be taking this up in their committee maybe this coming week, and then on the floor right away as soon as they pass it out of committee.
[00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:22.806]  Once it passes the Senate, it does not go to the governor.
[00:17:22.866 --> 00:17:23.327]  It's done.
[00:17:23.487 --> 00:17:24.107]  It's passed.
[00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:24.748]  It's law.
[00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:27.451]  So we need to put the pressure on the Senate.
[00:17:28.027 --> 00:17:30.188]  Let them know that the people really want this.
[00:17:30.248 --> 00:17:31.188]  They want them to pass it.
[00:17:31.228 --> 00:17:32.448]  They want them to pass it soon.
[00:17:32.929 --> 00:17:34.529]  Give folks the bill number in the Senate.
[00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:36.430]  It is the same bill.
[00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.590]  It's H.J.R.
[00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.590]  1003.
[00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:44.092]  And Randy Brogdon does have another bill that is over there.
[00:17:44.132 --> 00:17:45.953]  It's S.J.R.
[00:17:45.973 --> 00:17:45.953]  10.
[00:17:46.793 --> 00:17:52.235]  So mine that's already passed and is kind of on the fast track is H.J.R. 1003.
[00:17:54.304 --> 00:17:56.145]  His bill is S.J.R.
[00:17:56.846 --> 00:17:56.145]  10.
[00:17:57.166 --> 00:18:04.752]  And he said they may try tricks, uh, because they think that you guys have the votes in the Senate, tricks, parliamentary tricks, to shoot it down.
[00:18:04.812 --> 00:18:05.692]  What are those tricks?
[00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:18.882]  Well, I didn't get to hear the interview, but, um, you know, they can try to, you know, there's different little procedures you can, you can pull, um, kind of caught me off guard on that one.
[00:18:18.902 --> 00:18:21.103]  They can attach it to other bills that aren't popular?
[00:18:22.104 --> 00:18:22.344]  Yeah.
[00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:31.372]  I'll be surprised if they do that, but I'll believe anything anymore, but I just don't expect that's going to happen, and especially if people will continue to call and email.
[00:18:31.392 --> 00:18:35.632]  We've gotten so many, and I appreciate it so much, but we can't slow down now.
[00:18:35.672 --> 00:18:38.013]  We've got to pick it up, take it up to another level.
[00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:39.253]  I don't think they'll do it.
[00:18:39.273 --> 00:18:40.853]  I think people are starting to get the opinion.
[00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:45.014]  I'm getting comments from legislators in Oklahoma just left and right.
[00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:49.155]  They're being, you know... Put your foot down on the pedal, son.
[00:18:49.235 --> 00:18:50.455]  Never mind them brakes.
[00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:53.036]  Let it all hang out, because we've got a run to make.
[00:18:54.588 --> 00:18:54.828]  Yeah.
[00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:58.110]  Yeah, if things are going well, let's just keep it up.
[00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.751]  Take it up to another level.
[00:19:00.952 --> 00:19:01.612]  Absolutely.
[00:19:02.712 --> 00:19:07.275]  Son, put your foot down on the pedal, never mind them brakes, because the globalists are coming.
[00:19:07.315 --> 00:19:16.720]  But I think this preemptive letting the feds know, and I agree with you, we've got to point out, I mean, have you read how many of his administration don't even pay taxes and just thumb their nose?
[00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:18.681]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[00:19:19.122 --> 00:19:19.922]  And that's where we're going.
[00:19:19.942 --> 00:19:21.663]  When you ignore the Constitution,
[00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:32.551]  When you ignore the supreme law of the land, in other words, when you don't have a set of rules and laws that are above everything else, it's called the rule of law.
[00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:44.138]  When you don't have laws that everyone has to follow and they're the same for everyone, they're not a different set for the leaders or the elitist or the politicians and another set for the people.
[00:19:44.693 --> 00:19:58.166]  Then things work well that way, but when you don't have that, when you have that violated, then what you devolve to is you devolve to leaders that do whatever they want to do, and then they have these laws that they apply to us whenever they want to apply them.
[00:19:58.767 --> 00:19:59.948]  And that's where we're going.
[00:20:00.008 --> 00:20:01.329]  We're practically there.
[00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.134]  And if the people don't stand up and put their foot down and stop this,
[00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:09.187]  It's just going to be, it's going to be like chaos.
[00:20:09.488 --> 00:20:11.288]  And the enemy is testing the water.
[00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:17.449]  They were about to pass a flatulence tax on all farm animals, and then there was so much pressure they backed off.
[00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:23.910]  They were setting up their Napa Superhighways, they've backed off for now, but then people say, well they're back again.
[00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.430]  Yeah, it's an eternal fight.
[00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.731]  The cost of liberty is eternal vigilance.
[00:20:28.091 --> 00:20:31.811]  Give us your website, give us contact info for folks that want to support you, sir.
[00:20:32.472 --> 00:20:34.192]  My website is charleskey.com.
[00:20:35.515 --> 00:20:41.723]  My email is Charles.Keye at OKHouse.gov.
[00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:45.148]  And what about folks that aren't on the computer?
[00:20:45.348 --> 00:20:45.809]  Phone number?
[00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:47.250]  Phone number would be 405-557-3333.
[00:20:51.127 --> 00:21:01.472]  7354.
[00:20:52.368 --> 00:21:01.472]  Well, you're volunteering for a lot to help listeners try to package something for the, what is it, 20 states that haven't introduced this stuff now.
[00:21:01.972 --> 00:21:08.595]  This is very exciting and just God bless you and others that are doing this, Charles K. Well, I appreciate it, Alex.
[00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:11.276]  You know, I think, I actually think the number's up to 29 right now.
[00:21:11.296 --> 00:21:11.676]  It might be 30.
[00:21:11.816 --> 00:21:13.037]  It's 30, yeah.
[00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:13.777]  Yeah.
[00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:18.259]  And I know, I know some other states, Florida's very close to having a bill
[00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:25.446]  West Virginia is very close, and I'm sure somebody else is out there getting ready to file some things that we don't know about.
[00:21:26.066 --> 00:21:28.567]  Alright, I hope to talk to you next week.
[00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.047]  I mean, how soon can this be passed?
[00:21:31.108 --> 00:21:36.950]  I think Broderick can get the two bills passed over the Senate next week, but I don't know what their schedule is.
[00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.251]  But it's possible it can be done next week.
[00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.172]  Well, let's hope the feds don't do what they did in 95.
[00:21:42.472 --> 00:21:43.833]  Charles Key, we'll talk to you soon.
[00:21:43.873 --> 00:21:44.574]  We salute you.
[00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:45.214]  Godspeed.
[00:21:45.734 --> 00:21:46.035]  Thank you.
[00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:46.475]  Appreciate it.
[00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:47.295]  You bet.
[00:21:47.315 --> 00:21:51.278]  We'll come right back with your phone calls and how the Obama administration doesn't pay taxes.
[00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:51.778]  Taxes?
[00:21:52.098 --> 00:21:53.579]  We don't need no stinking taxes.
[00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:54.179]  That's for you.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.540]  We're on the march.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.621]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:58.562 --> 00:22:01.324]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:04.465 --> 00:22:07.047]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:10.630]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.412]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:20.976]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:22:21.356 --> 00:22:26.380]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:33.284]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:34.465]  Need something more?
[00:22:34.685 --> 00:22:38.330]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:46.699]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:52.626]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:22:52.646 --> 00:22:54.527]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:55.307]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:11.616 --> 00:23:12.796]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:12.816 --> 00:23:14.437]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:14.517 --> 00:23:21.600]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:30.403]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:23:30.683 --> 00:23:35.605]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:36.845 --> 00:23:37.946]  An inside job.
[00:23:39.358 --> 00:23:40.439]  How dare you?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.863]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:49.284]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:56.188]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:03.813]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:24:04.605 --> 00:24:07.887]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:10.488]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[00:24:26.596 --> 00:24:26.996]  I think so.
[00:24:50.373 --> 00:24:50.873]  We're good to go.
[00:25:19.462 --> 00:25:23.597]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment, then we've got guests joining us coming up in about 15 minutes.
[00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:36.155]  Before we go to your phone calls quickly, Wilson, Mark, Matt, Lindsey, Greg, and others, I want to tell you about one of our great sponsors, SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:38.817]  One word, SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:25:39.217 --> 00:25:43.721]  Now you can grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free from the New World Order.
[00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:49.665]  Our sponsor, Survivalist Seeds, has now drastically reduced their price for heirloom seeds at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:25:50.046 --> 00:25:52.367]  They now sell 6,000 rare heirloom seeds.
[00:25:53.228 --> 00:25:54.769]  From 20 varieties for just $108.95.
[00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.612]  That is an incredible deal.
[00:25:58.573 --> 00:26:05.539]  There's a real heirloom seed shortage right now, so people who are interested in growing their own healthy food need to get their heirloom seeds now and start their gardens this spring.
[00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:06.840]  Freedom Starts with Action.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.443]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is how you survive.
[00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:12.086]  This world economic collapse.
[00:26:12.587 --> 00:26:16.268]  We've got to be self-sufficient and at least start moving in that direction.
[00:26:17.048 --> 00:26:19.509]  The place to start is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:21.149]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:26:21.489 --> 00:26:23.030]  Wilson in New York.
[00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.510]  You're on the air, Wilson.
[00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:30.912]  I hear you breathing, Wilson.
[00:26:34.453 --> 00:26:36.174]  Let's talk to Mark in Oregon.
[00:26:36.234 --> 00:26:37.154]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:26:38.654 --> 00:26:39.495]  Morning, Brother Alex.
[00:26:39.555 --> 00:26:40.155]  How are you doing?
[00:26:40.836 --> 00:26:41.496]  All right, Mark.
[00:26:42.257 --> 00:26:50.140]  Alex, last night, George Norrie had on a guest that he's had on before, a man named Roger Tolsis.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:27:07.166]  I don't know if you're familiar with him, but he's a professional security analyst and researcher, and he says that an individual's DNA can now be used to tailor-make an electromagnetic signal, which is transmitted to the individual
[00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.291]  That they want to transmit it to, they can direct this to an individual.
[00:27:12.472 --> 00:27:16.473]  And that this signal then interacts with the person's genetic structure.
[00:27:16.813 --> 00:27:31.017]  Yeah, they have electro, the DNA is electrochemical, and I know DARPA and the Pentagon have worked on systems, I didn't know they could tailor it down to DNA, but they do have systems that they can beam you with it off and on from one of their surveillance blimps, and then you get cancer.
[00:27:31.798 --> 00:27:35.579]  Yes, and that's very similar to what you're speaking of, but now they've got it to where they can
[00:27:36.255 --> 00:27:50.044]  As long as they have a DNA sample, and I, you know, when I think of what he said last night, I think of, you know, you very well publicized the fact that they've been taking blood samples from babies at birth, basically, since 1973, I think you said.
[00:27:50.064 --> 00:27:53.286]  Yeah, the Austin American State's been said for 44 years.
[00:27:53.726 --> 00:27:55.107]  We have the government documents.
[00:27:55.567 --> 00:28:04.373]  It's, for instance, since 36 years ago, all over the western world, and it's held in United Nations and Cold Spring Harbor eugenics laboratories publicly.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.280]  Yes.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:11.183]  So... So, I mean, it is being held by those that openly say 80% of us at least need to be killed.
[00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:12.504]  Yes, at least.
[00:28:12.584 --> 00:28:12.924]  More like that.
[00:28:12.944 --> 00:28:13.924]  And they illegally did it.
[00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:15.145]  I mean, it's admitted it's illegal.
[00:28:15.325 --> 00:28:16.226]  But they just, it's criminal.
[00:28:16.246 --> 00:28:16.726]  They're criminals.
[00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:18.687]  Yes, they step right out in the open.
[00:28:18.727 --> 00:28:21.568]  They, of course, it's their same old saw these days.
[00:28:21.588 --> 00:28:24.570]  Where they're looking at it from is they have the brute force.
[00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.190]  They can do anything they want to do.
[00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:31.493]  They have the means with which to enslave mankind, they feel in their minds, I believe.
[00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:32.952]  As we speak here.
[00:28:33.252 --> 00:28:35.814]  They can let the hammer down any time.
[00:28:36.274 --> 00:28:39.176]  That's their attitude and they have an agenda to fulfill.
[00:28:39.196 --> 00:28:46.441]  It gets into deeper things as to why they don't move faster, but I believe at the top there's God.
[00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:47.441]  He controls them.
[00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:51.444]  But Alex, when it comes to this, as well as chemtrails and when it comes to
[00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:56.953]  These so-called cell phone towers that they have constructed, which also have this capability.
[00:28:56.993 --> 00:29:11.058]  Okay, DARPA has openly said, this was in the Baltimore Sun eight years ago, and then I saw it again a few months ago, that they are, DARPA is testing towers, but they said just to calm the public during emergencies.
[00:29:11.098 --> 00:29:12.178]  They've got frequencies.
[00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:13.859]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:14.479]  We're in 2009, boys and girls.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.062]  And, I mean, that sounds like freedom, having mind control towers.
[00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:20.482]  I appreciate your call.
[00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:21.563]  I mean, that's reasonable.
[00:29:22.123 --> 00:29:23.144]  These are nice people.
[00:29:23.304 --> 00:29:23.964]  Thank you, Mark.
[00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:24.745]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:29:24.785 --> 00:29:25.766]  Matt in Missouri, you bet.
[00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:26.946]  Matt in Missouri, you're on the air.
[00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:27.386]  Go ahead.
[00:29:28.747 --> 00:29:29.248]  Hey, Alex.
[00:29:29.948 --> 00:29:30.148]  Hi.
[00:29:30.408 --> 00:29:35.931]  I know you have representative guests on from here in Missouri.
[00:29:36.532 --> 00:29:36.772]  Yes.
[00:29:37.072 --> 00:29:43.756]  And Jerry's getting past a lot of anti-New World Order
[00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:45.729]  Legislation here in Missouri.
[00:29:45.749 --> 00:29:54.451]  We've got HB 361, which is the Anti-Real ID Act.
[00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.271]  Which is not to be used against the illegals.
[00:29:56.311 --> 00:29:57.112]  It's for citizens.
[00:29:57.452 --> 00:29:58.352]  The illegals are exempt.
[00:29:59.392 --> 00:30:00.752]  They just got that passed out of committee.
[00:30:00.772 --> 00:30:06.273]  Just like they have federal ID requirements to get a federal job or contract, but the illegals are exempt.
[00:30:06.313 --> 00:30:07.734]  That is in the stimulus bill.
[00:30:08.914 --> 00:30:09.174]  Right.
[00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:13.075]  And you just got that passed out of committee, so if we could have help
[00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:22.290]  Everybody should look at the list of states that are up on InfoWars.com and they should call all those states and make sure it gets passed.
[00:30:23.931 --> 00:30:41.294]  And of course you've got ACR 13 which is the 10th Amendment one that you've had one about and you've got several others that are... And if I could also make a point, you know you had the caller earlier with some stuff on the biblical stuff.
[00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:46.582]  Like Representative Keith said earlier, you know, we've got to fight this.
[00:30:46.622 --> 00:30:49.143]  There's not going to be any pre-tribulation rapture.
[00:30:49.183 --> 00:30:50.383]  It's very clear about that.
[00:30:50.404 --> 00:30:53.745]  There's nowhere in there that says anything about a rapture.
[00:30:54.025 --> 00:30:59.647]  Look, look, the globalists over a hundred years ago financed all this, and they financed these movies and these books.
[00:31:00.207 --> 00:31:07.029]  And literally, you go to church, it's a bunch of thumbsuckers worshipping the government, saying, praise God, things are getting bad, we'll soon be out of here.
[00:31:07.929 --> 00:31:09.610]  It's cult members, they're not Christians.
[00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.870]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:31:11.211 --> 00:31:12.111]  And I'm sick of them.
[00:31:13.007 --> 00:31:16.430]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in... We just talked to Matt.
[00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.711]  Let's talk to Lindsey in Idaho.
[00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:18.612]  Lindsey, you're on the air.
[00:31:19.793 --> 00:31:20.414]  Hello, Alex.
[00:31:20.794 --> 00:31:21.395]  Hello, Lindsey.
[00:31:21.795 --> 00:31:22.556]  How are you today?
[00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:23.116]  Good.
[00:31:23.877 --> 00:31:26.419]  Ah, just a pleasant surprise.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.724]  I have on my home page on my computer is the MSN, you know, home page.
[00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:37.189]  And they have, of course, the news, the sports, and the money section, which I always watch.
[00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:43.521]  Number one article right now is Fear Factor Gun Sales on the Rise.
[00:31:44.662 --> 00:31:47.803]  And I thought, okay, that looks like an interesting article.
[00:31:47.843 --> 00:31:48.744]  Let's see what it is.
[00:31:48.824 --> 00:32:03.752]  And I click over to it, and this guy's talking about in this time of the stock market and all that Smith & Wesson, Ruger and Cabela's are all making tremendous profits because of gun sales and so forth.
[00:32:03.772 --> 00:32:04.292]  Is that MSNBC?
[00:32:04.312 --> 00:32:04.492]  Yeah.
[00:32:07.732 --> 00:32:08.873]  MSNBC.com?
[00:32:09.373 --> 00:32:14.577]  Yeah, www.msn.com is the homepage.
[00:32:15.457 --> 00:32:16.618]  And you'll see it under money.
[00:32:16.818 --> 00:32:18.599]  So I went and I started to read the article.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:29.967]  There's about a half a dozen other articles here about jobs and surfing your way through it, and they have here about the number of comments and views
[00:32:31.155 --> 00:32:36.698]  On this particular article, there are 145,000 views.
[00:32:36.858 --> 00:32:40.279]  No other article has gotten more than maybe 2,000 or 3,000, some less than 1,000.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.500]  No, no, everything is Second Amendment now.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.442]  Folks are really waking up with these dirtbags going after our guns.
[00:32:45.842 --> 00:32:47.043]  Yeah, this is what I'm saying.
[00:32:47.143 --> 00:32:48.183]  And so I was curious.
[00:32:48.263 --> 00:32:49.764]  I said, well, let's go to the comments.
[00:32:49.824 --> 00:32:51.945]  I want to see what some of the American people are...
[00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:54.406]  Writing in to MSN on this article.
[00:32:54.426 --> 00:33:00.627]  And it's all, it's New World Order, you'll never get our guns, states' rights, and I go to ABC News, I go everywhere.
[00:33:00.847 --> 00:33:06.368]  When the Wall Street Journal says we need world government, every comment of thousands is you're gonna be defeated, globalists.
[00:33:06.388 --> 00:33:07.929]  But let me guess, what did it say?
[00:33:08.329 --> 00:33:09.269]  This was pleasant.
[00:33:09.609 --> 00:33:15.950]  Just several of these comments, and all I'm gonna say is this, out of the hundreds and hundreds, there's like 60 pages now of comments.
[00:33:16.711 --> 00:33:18.091]  The majority of the people
[00:33:18.905 --> 00:33:20.445]  What is this under on MSN.com?
[00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:21.766]  I'm on it right now.
[00:33:21.826 --> 00:33:22.166]  What section?
[00:33:44.864 --> 00:33:51.687]  The homepage, MSN.com, and you go down, it's just to the bottom right.
[00:33:52.027 --> 00:33:52.988]  What's the subsection?
[00:33:54.268 --> 00:33:55.309]  Fear Factor, I found it.
[00:33:56.189 --> 00:33:56.449]  Yeah.
[00:33:57.309 --> 00:33:57.630]  Okay.
[00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.610]  You see it now?
[00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.151]  It says Fear Factor Gun Sales.
[00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.051]  You click on that.
[00:34:01.191 --> 00:34:01.691]  Now I'm on it.
[00:34:02.172 --> 00:34:03.292]  And it goes to the article.
[00:34:04.213 --> 00:34:09.735]  And of course, the guy, he's talking about money in the stocks, and this was, you know, I guess the drive of the article.
[00:34:10.205 --> 00:34:16.972]  But it was like I said here where it says discussed 580 comments and 145,000 views.
[00:34:17.592 --> 00:34:19.234]  People are waking up.
[00:34:21.016 --> 00:34:22.317]  That's the whole key.
[00:34:22.357 --> 00:34:23.098]  Let me stop you.
[00:34:23.118 --> 00:34:23.778]  Let me stop you.
[00:34:24.018 --> 00:34:24.579]  Let me stop you.
[00:34:24.939 --> 00:34:29.183]  But they're going to stage terror attacks soon to try to get people to go back into fear.
[00:34:29.564 --> 00:34:34.228]  So we need to expose who's going to be behind the terror so when they carry it out that only wakes people up.
[00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:34.609]  Go ahead.
[00:34:35.213 --> 00:34:35.713]  Absolutely.
[00:34:35.993 --> 00:34:37.994]  Well, again, I'll let you go.
[00:34:38.014 --> 00:34:38.894]  I know you're a busy man.
[00:34:38.934 --> 00:34:41.275]  You've got other people with smarter things than I do.
[00:34:41.535 --> 00:34:41.835]  Oh, no.
[00:34:41.895 --> 00:34:42.375]  Great point.
[00:34:42.635 --> 00:34:43.516]  Appreciate your call.
[00:34:44.196 --> 00:34:46.716]  Let's go ahead and take one more, and then we're going to get our guest online.
[00:34:47.317 --> 00:34:51.718]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in California.
[00:34:51.738 --> 00:34:52.518]  Greg, you're on the air.
[00:34:52.538 --> 00:34:54.839]  Hey, thanks for being there, Alex.
[00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:55.419]  Thank you.
[00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.920]  I do have one question, though.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.401]  You say always to question things, and secondly, most important, follow the money trail.
[00:35:02.116 --> 00:35:08.400]  I'm wondering what happened to the CAFR proposal by Walter Buren.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:19.906]  Why, if Congress is so supportive of instituting all these resolutions, they don't bring these two-thirds of the money they have available into supporting things that are going to support the Constitution and bring back
[00:35:23.993 --> 00:35:29.838]  Well, we need to get my film, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, exposed out to people.
[00:35:30.439 --> 00:35:36.145]  These state legislatures, not the Congress, federally, are being educated by us right now.
[00:35:36.765 --> 00:35:39.368]  And so you need to educate them about the double set of books.
[00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:40.629]  Some of them know, a lot of them don't.
[00:35:40.649 --> 00:35:41.950]  The committee chairman, a lot of people do.
[00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:50.940]  And we need to expose the scam and call for criminal investigations of the banking and state and federal and county financing systems, and that's what we call for here.
[00:35:52.302 --> 00:35:57.248]  Okay, so how can we best support that, uh, what, uh, education?
[00:35:58.258 --> 00:36:14.569]  Yeah, I think you need to write your own article with basic facts, or send them links to my film free on Google or YouTube, and go to the legislature, bring them a copy, and it's all part of this awakening process.
[00:36:14.909 --> 00:36:21.354]  Just like Charles Keith said, we need to point out just simply, these are criminals in the federal government, these are lawless thugs who are breaking the law.
[00:36:22.034 --> 00:36:22.755]  That's my point.
[00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:25.758]  You know that Key and other people that are supporting these resolutions are
[00:36:37.363 --> 00:36:42.047]  Are they knowledgeable about the CFR funds available?
[00:36:42.327 --> 00:36:45.790]  Look, I'm not omnipresent and I appreciate your call.
[00:36:46.931 --> 00:36:48.052]  They're doing the best they can.
[00:36:48.092 --> 00:36:49.413]  They're anti-private federal reserve.
[00:36:49.453 --> 00:36:51.955]  That means they're anti-comprehensive financial report.
[00:36:52.295 --> 00:36:53.736]  And I would imagine a lot of them are aware of it.
[00:36:54.237 --> 00:36:56.138]  And we're trying as hard as we can.
[00:36:56.218 --> 00:36:57.359]  So you need to call them.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.801]  You need to ask them.
[00:36:59.161 --> 00:36:59.861]  You need to do it.
[00:37:00.602 --> 00:37:00.942]  Okay?
[00:37:02.003 --> 00:37:04.865]  We're trying as hard as we can to do the best job we can here.
[00:37:05.808 --> 00:37:06.688]  I assure you of that.
[00:37:10.529 --> 00:37:12.789]  I just told you, you know, you move the ball.
[00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:13.609]  You have the power.
[00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:14.549]  You're the people.
[00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.610]  Not me.
[00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:17.330]  I said I made a film.
[00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.150]  I made it for free.
[00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.250]  I did everything I could.
[00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.191]  I have guests on about it all the time.
[00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:25.431]  And I kind of get the idea of, you know, there's like, ooh, something stinky in Denmark.
[00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:26.412]  You make it.
[00:37:26.452 --> 00:37:26.912]  You go.
[00:37:27.632 --> 00:37:28.052]  You do it.
[00:37:28.072 --> 00:37:30.732]  You know, let's abolish the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:30.752 --> 00:37:32.693]  Let's support Ron Paul's bill to do that.
[00:37:33.133 --> 00:37:34.073]  Let's do it, man!
[00:37:34.113 --> 00:37:34.833]  Let's do it!
[00:37:38.459 --> 00:37:53.979]  Okay, I'm excited for the next hour and 15 minutes to have David Bay and Chris Pinto of Cutting Edge Ministries, and I have carried now three of their films.
[00:37:56.479 --> 00:38:03.344]  The latest documentary is right here, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 3, Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:38:03.384 --> 00:38:06.887]  It's available right now at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore.
[00:38:07.487 --> 00:38:08.828]  And I've seen all three of the films.
[00:38:09.049 --> 00:38:10.870]  These are with actors, well-directed.
[00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.952]  I can't believe how good they are for the budget they've got.
[00:38:13.972 --> 00:38:19.617]  I mean, this is real filmmaking, and it's like better than Discovery Channel or History Channel when you see those history shows.
[00:38:20.597 --> 00:38:21.418]  Very well done.
[00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:24.781]  Eye of the Phoenix is the third volume in the Secret Mysteries series.
[00:38:25.828 --> 00:38:33.572]  Unfolding the Hidden Layers of America's Beginnings, Part 3 exposes more on the founding of America with a focus on the history of the dollar bill.
[00:38:33.592 --> 00:38:42.698]  We'll be taking your calls on this next hour, but let's punch this up on screen so the people watching prisonplanet.tv live, simulcast, the radio show can see that.
[00:38:42.758 --> 00:38:44.759]  We'll put a link up to the shopping cart for folks.
[00:38:47.295 --> 00:38:50.838]  We can also call toll free to get it at 888-253-3139.
[00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:54.040]  But we'll talk more about that.
[00:38:54.321 --> 00:39:00.005]  Let's start breaking this down right now and kind of briefly recap the first two films and now this third film.
[00:39:00.466 --> 00:39:02.627]  David Bay and Chris Pinto, thank you for coming on, man.
[00:39:03.188 --> 00:39:03.928]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:05.590]  Thanks for having us, Alex.
[00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.671]  You bet, good to have you here.
[00:39:08.932 --> 00:39:10.093]  Who should I start with first?
[00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:14.297]  I don't know, cue your boys in there, Alex.
[00:39:15.447 --> 00:39:17.108]  Are you guys on the same phone line together?
[00:39:17.128 --> 00:39:17.168]  No.
[00:39:17.728 --> 00:39:19.508]  No, separate phone lines.
[00:39:20.129 --> 00:39:27.611]  Okay, well let's just start with, now you guys have directed these together, some are directed just by Pinto, others are directed together.
[00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:31.533]  Tell me about the new film, just a boil down of Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:39:32.753 --> 00:39:33.253]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:39:33.733 --> 00:39:35.034]  Well, Eye of the Phoenix is...
[00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:46.835]  The research for this really began when we started doing the research for Part 1, and we were interviewing kind of our chief expert, a guy named Buff Perry.
[00:39:47.596 --> 00:40:04.823]  And Buff Perry has very close associations with the Rorick Museum, and this guy Nicholas Rorick, at least the memory of Rorick and the history of him and his family, and his affiliation with the FDR administration, and all of the links between Rorick, FDR,
[00:40:05.393 --> 00:40:10.196]  Henry Wallace, who was the Secretary of Agriculture and who became the Vice President.
[00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:19.500]  And then, of course, all of their links to Manly P. Hall, who's, you know, considered the masonry's greatest philosopher and so on.
[00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:29.686]  But all of these guys were interacting with each other in the 1920s and 30s, in the years prior to FDR making the decision to put the Great Seal
[00:40:30.702 --> 00:40:37.647]  on the back of the dollar bill and then to overhaul the whole design of the dollar and to come in with all the intricacies that are now there.
[00:40:38.507 --> 00:40:43.311]  And with these guys, this is a public ritual of putting this on the dollar bill.
[00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:45.132]  It had been the secret seal for a long time.
[00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:51.136]  They believe this meant that a great part of their New Order or New World Order had been built?
[00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:54.678]  Well, that's the way that it comes across.
[00:40:54.698 --> 00:40:59.101]  If you read the official history from the State Department, and we document it in the film,
[00:40:59.642 --> 00:41:26.157]  The account that the State Department gives on the history of the Great Seal, and it going to the back of the dollar bill, talks about how Henry Wallace saw it, and Wallace apparently, at least in the account, acts as though he'd never seen it before, and he thought it was very powerful, and of course he was a 32nd degree mason, and so he brought it to FDR, who was also a 32nd degree mason at the time, and FDR reacted to it as though he had never seen it,
[00:41:27.143 --> 00:41:37.045]  And they both believe that the New Order of the Ages, the Novus Ordo Seclorum, and FDR's idea for the New Deal were one and the same thing.
[00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:45.067]  And now they're saying we're on the verge of a global New Deal, which is a global bank ruling the United States and every other country in the world.
[00:41:45.107 --> 00:41:52.189]  This is being trumpeted everywhere, so it's key to study this to understand now they believe they're finally bringing in the final world government.
[00:41:53.049 --> 00:41:59.471]  Yeah, and they're repeatedly associating Barack Obama with FDR, and they're calling him the next FDR.
[00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:06.133]  And he said three times in his acceptance speech, in his swearing-in speech, the new age is here.
[00:42:07.294 --> 00:42:08.154]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:10.715]  He's continually making reference to the new age.
[00:42:11.135 --> 00:42:19.598]  It's almost like they're totally letting their hair down at this point, and just coming out with it, that yes, this is what they've planned to do all along.
[00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:23.013]  And they're becoming more and more open about it.
[00:42:23.453 --> 00:42:34.461]  Now, of course, this new age means most of us are going to be killed, but right now everybody's giggling and happily running down to the guillotines, not having an idea that... But let's go to the film when we come back.
[00:42:34.481 --> 00:42:35.642]  This is very exciting.
[00:42:35.682 --> 00:42:36.603]  The film is excellent.
[00:42:37.423 --> 00:42:38.044]  Just amazing.
[00:42:38.184 --> 00:42:39.585]  Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:42:39.725 --> 00:42:41.406]  Get it at Infowars.com.
[00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:42.827]  Show it to your pastor.
[00:42:42.867 --> 00:42:43.508]  Show it to your neighbors.
[00:42:43.548 --> 00:42:47.170]  Give it to low-level Masons or high-level Masons and ask them, you know, what do you think of this?
[00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:51.896]  Most masons aren't bad people, they're just deceived.
[00:42:52.376 --> 00:42:56.101]  It's just like any gang system or any intelligence operation, it's highly compartmentalized.
[00:42:56.121 --> 00:43:01.168]  Alright, we'll come back with Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill, right after this break.
[00:43:04.452 --> 00:43:10.114]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:43:10.394 --> 00:43:15.175]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:43:15.415 --> 00:43:20.377]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:24.038]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:43:24.518 --> 00:43:32.701]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:38.003]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:43:38.844 --> 00:43:44.586]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:43:44.826 --> 00:43:47.127]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:43:47.407 --> 00:43:49.849]  ...cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:55.734]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:58.056]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:10.726]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:12.748]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:13.903 --> 00:44:14.744]  Who is the enemy?
[00:44:15.264 --> 00:44:15.765]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:16.065 --> 00:44:17.046]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:17.066 --> 00:44:18.407]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:18.427 --> 00:44:20.068]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:20.428 --> 00:44:27.174]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:27.574 --> 00:44:28.014]  Some U.S.
[00:44:28.054 --> 00:44:33.679]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:34.399 --> 00:44:37.882]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:37.902 --> 00:44:39.884]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:04.787 --> 00:45:12.431]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:14.031]  You need the Paclite.
[00:45:14.472 --> 00:45:22.315]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:45:22.695 --> 00:45:25.857]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:30.679]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:32.340]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.002]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:45:37.442 --> 00:45:41.743]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:45:42.104 --> 00:45:48.766]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.

[00:46:24.489 --> 00:46:26.751]  Chris Pinto, David Bay are our guests.
[00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:28.512]  Their third film, just so well done.
[00:46:28.592 --> 00:46:34.236]  Secret Messages of America's Beginnings, Volume 3, I or the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:46:34.336 --> 00:46:34.736]  You know,
[00:46:54.218 --> 00:46:55.799]  I shouldn't even really ask a lot of questions.
[00:46:56.019 --> 00:46:59.421]  I've researched this, but you guys have gone to another level of that, a different perspective.
[00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:12.047]  Just break down the basics, and then let's go through what this I is, what the New World Order is, why they put it on the dollar bill, and then how this ties into Obama today, and go through some of the film itself.
[00:47:12.147 --> 00:47:13.308]  It's just amazing.
[00:47:13.888 --> 00:47:14.769]  You guys, go ahead.
[00:47:14.789 --> 00:47:15.449]  You've got the floor.
[00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.831]  Go ahead, David.
[00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:39.366]  Well, we show that the same message that we told in Riddleton Stone is shown in the medium of the dollar bill, and that is that the Masonic Fraternity, back in 1776 in that era, decided to establish America as the New Atlantis
[00:47:50.539 --> 00:47:58.983]  As a nation that would gradually lead the rest of the world into the New World Order, and then stage their Masonic Messiah.
[00:47:59.463 --> 00:48:10.268]  That's the message of the street layouts and the paintings and the sculptures of Washington, D.C., as we told in Riddleton Stone, and that's the message on the dollar bill.
[00:48:10.408 --> 00:48:12.950]  You know, all the symbolisms of the one dollar bill.
[00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.711]  It's the same message, it's the same story.
[00:48:16.286 --> 00:48:43.867]  And regarding the currency itself, at the end of this video, we show that the eagle on the back of the dollar bill was really the Egyptian Phoenix Bird, and of course, that bird at the appointed time, you know, dies, and it's expected to die, and its body bursts into flame, and out of the ashes comes a new Phoenix Bird.
[00:48:44.268 --> 00:48:46.069]  And we show that, you know, our belief
[00:48:46.894 --> 00:49:02.034]  That the dollar bill was designed to be as the phoenix bird and at the end of the period go into destruction and dissolve and out of that destruction will come the global currency and the global new world order.
[00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:08.954]  And Albert Pike wrote this in the 1760s and 70s, founder of the Klan, Confederate General, Grand Commander.
[00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:14.156]  Manly P. Hall wrote this, and I talked to Masons, and they don't even know about this.
[00:49:14.176 --> 00:49:18.617]  I mean, they're not being secretive, they just deny it and can't believe it because they're porch Masons.
[00:49:19.318 --> 00:49:20.738]  And now we're here, the destruction.
[00:49:21.739 --> 00:49:24.100]  Your take on this, Chris Pinto.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:32.323]  Well, I think the important part about the symbolism of the Phoenix, especially as it pertains to FDR's administration,
[00:49:32.984 --> 00:49:37.086]  is that Manly Hall was the guy who was writing all of this stuff in his books.
[00:49:37.226 --> 00:49:42.868]  He was the one who was describing the American Eagle as an Egyptian Phoenix bird.
[00:49:42.908 --> 00:49:47.670]  That it was a cleverly disguised phoenix and all of the symbolism that goes with it.
[00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:58.094]  Now FDR, right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor apparently, sent emissaries to Manly Hall's library to microfiche all of his materials.
[00:49:58.854 --> 00:50:01.595]  And the chief things that Hall was writing about
[00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:16.570]  During that era had to do with the secret destiny of America and how secret societies had planned America as the new Atlantis and that it was going to develop into this one world democratic system, supposedly.
[00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:25.056]  And this was all what FDR seems to have been influenced by because he's talking about the destiny of America in his writings.
[00:50:25.441 --> 00:50:27.503]  Well, we've got a break, back in one minute.
[00:50:28.003 --> 00:50:36.410]  We see the same thing from, of course, Woodrow Wilson writing the book, The New World Order, and then before he died saying, I was conned, it's all a scam, it's evil.
[00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:42.395]  Because they suck in people about how loving and good it is, but at the end they find out it's a very dark God.
[00:50:45.137 --> 00:50:49.961]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:11.305]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:11.525 --> 00:51:12.466]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:12.647 --> 00:51:15.571]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:51:56.906 --> 00:51:58.808]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:59.288 --> 00:52:02.010]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:32.673]  Okay, David May, Chris Pinto, I have the Phoenix Seekers of the Dollar Bill.
[00:52:33.493 --> 00:52:40.416]  You were continuing, Chris, with the destruction of the United States, the rise of world government.
[00:52:40.436 --> 00:52:41.056]  Please continue.
[00:52:42.277 --> 00:52:43.758]  Yeah, it's just very interesting.
[00:52:43.778 --> 00:52:48.680]  You know, I've been reading articles just about the planned destruction of America.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.842]  In fact, there was that book, I think, about ten years ago by James Wardner, by that title.
[00:52:55.376 --> 00:52:59.238]  I remember when I first started hearing about this, it sounded too incredible to be believed.
[00:53:00.198 --> 00:53:17.925]  A family member of mine called me, who had been skeptical about this, and then talked about watching a video presentation that dated back in 1995, where somebody was talking about the financial situation in America, and how they were planning the destruction of our economy.
[00:53:18.665 --> 00:53:23.367]  And it seems too incredible to be believed, but then when the housing market crashed,
[00:53:23.996 --> 00:53:29.120]  And then you have China and France coming out calling for global currency and a new world order.
[00:53:30.321 --> 00:53:37.366]  And then Henry Kissinger coming forward and talking about how Obama's positioned for the establishment of a new world order.
[00:53:37.446 --> 00:53:42.610]  It's as though everything is happening right on cue, right according to some greater plan.
[00:53:43.391 --> 00:53:47.394]  And I think the symbolism, we talk at great length about the
[00:53:48.137 --> 00:54:14.558]  You know, the esoteric symbolism of the symbols on the dollar bill and what they may well have meant to men like Hall, to Nicholas Roerich, to Henry Wallace and FDR, and that collectively they would have symbolized this destruction of a, you know, of a phoenix that then leads to a rebirth, and that by destroying America's currency and possibly America itself,
[00:54:15.459 --> 00:54:23.146]  I mean, there was just yesterday Glenn Beck on Fox News had a quote that was sent out by Rupert Murdoch.
[00:54:23.207 --> 00:54:25.989]  I don't know if you guys caught this, but it was very interesting.
[00:54:26.009 --> 00:54:28.752]  Yeah, we caught it about how this new order is upon us.
[00:54:29.192 --> 00:54:29.412]  Right.
[00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:32.655]  The new order is upon us, world government.
[00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:33.937]  You go, I don't want that.
[00:54:34.217 --> 00:54:35.178]  It does not exist.
[00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:36.059]  Seize him.
[00:54:37.594 --> 00:54:51.504]  Right, but it's just incredible how everybody is just stepping forward as though they all know what is supposed to happen right on cue, and now things move forward.
[00:54:52.705 --> 00:55:02.312]  But yeah, that's general, but what we're talking about in Eye of the Phoenix is all of the undercurrent for these things and how they materialize through the 20th century.
[00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:12.432]  We sidestepped carefully because a lot of the debates about the dollar bill have to do with the Founding Fathers of America and what the Founding Fathers intended.
[00:55:12.992 --> 00:55:20.913]  And that's very difficult to discern when you focus on the Great Seal and try to figure out what they intended for the symbolism there.
[00:55:21.653 --> 00:55:30.315]  Because you had 14 different men that worked on three committees, and then all of their work was handed over to one man, Charles Thompson.
[00:55:30.953 --> 00:55:37.037]  Who then comes up with the final seal design and he submits it to Congress in a written form.
[00:55:37.397 --> 00:55:38.818]  It's just a written description.
[00:55:38.858 --> 00:55:43.400]  He had some preliminary sketches, but ultimately it was all just written down.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.721]  Congress approved that.
[00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:50.724]  And then you had these realizations of the seal that came about, but they were all slightly different.
[00:55:51.645 --> 00:56:00.150]  Uh, but the, the formal design, the one that you know, we see on the internet and that people write about and talk about that has all of this precision to it.
[00:56:00.649 --> 00:56:06.874]  And this masonic and occult imagery, that was made formal during FDR's administration.
[00:56:07.735 --> 00:56:21.347]  That's where things like the stars above the eagle's head went from being just a loose star field into a hexagram with a circle around it, like the Star of David and so on.
[00:56:21.367 --> 00:56:26.211]  And so we've got one of our occult experts, Doc Marquis, who comes in
[00:56:26.661 --> 00:56:29.522]  and explains the series of hexagrams that he finds.
[00:56:46.289 --> 00:56:57.873]  And they believe these symbols to have power need to be shown, like the Washington Monument, the big phallus in the capitals of the breast of the goddess, with the goddess, you know, capping them.
[00:56:58.273 --> 00:57:00.394]  And they're bringing all of this in.
[00:57:00.734 --> 00:57:02.655]  We'll talk about their fruits when we come back.
[00:57:04.403 --> 00:57:07.326]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:57:07.486 --> 00:57:12.750]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:18.375]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:19.856]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:20.216 --> 00:57:29.124]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:57:29.524 --> 00:57:31.146]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:57:31.346 --> 00:57:35.530]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:58:04.341 --> 00:58:10.723]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:11.103 --> 00:58:12.783]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.780]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:15.801]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:17.081]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:17.101 --> 00:58:18.382]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:18.422 --> 00:58:20.102]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:20.442 --> 00:58:27.205]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:27.585 --> 00:58:28.025]  Some U.S.
[00:58:28.085 --> 00:58:33.727]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:34.427 --> 00:58:37.910]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:39.911]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:04.597 --> 00:59:08.002]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:59:08.122 --> 00:59:13.349]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:13.529 --> 00:59:18.235]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:19.497 --> 00:59:29.840]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:35.741]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:42.043]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:59:42.243 --> 00:59:42.883]  What about you?

[01:00:10.317 --> 01:00:11.357]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:12.098 --> 01:00:13.198]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:13.858 --> 01:00:14.659]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.419 --> 01:00:16.340]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.642]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:25.284]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.485 --> 01:00:36.190]  This film also deals with these theosophic societies that just carry on the ancient Babylon mission religion.
[01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:44.442]  Who are searching the world for their Christ and they claim many different people have been this Maitreya.
[01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:53.848]  One of them that they announced was their leader in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s is the guy that you see in the new Zeitgeist addendum and then all the symbolism and that.
[01:00:53.868 --> 01:01:00.332]  So we also have a lot of these groups now coming into the Patriot or Awakening movement and they say that this, you know, this Christ is coming.
[01:01:01.252 --> 01:01:03.413]  And the churches have been, you know, prepared for that.
[01:01:04.134 --> 01:01:06.215]  They've been told to support Israel no matter what Israel does.
[01:01:06.255 --> 01:01:08.717]  But the Bible says the Antichrist will be there first, posing.
[01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:12.639]  So this is just amazing deception that's going on.
[01:01:12.659 --> 01:01:24.326]  A lot of people then say, well, you know, the Babylon Mystery School people kind of planted the Bible as ideas to be a type of predictive programming to where this will be manifest.
[01:01:24.386 --> 01:01:29.689]  But if you really read deeper, this is another counterfeit lie they're putting out.
[01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:40.209]  And expanding on that, they believe that they need to get rid of the majority of the world's population.
[01:01:40.269 --> 01:01:46.831]  So if you look at the fruits of the New World Order and the high-level masons, which is just one arm of this, very horrible fruits.
[01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:49.652]  Very, very horrible things they do.
[01:01:50.312 --> 01:01:51.652]  Incredible human degradation.
[01:01:51.692 --> 01:01:53.993]  And they rationalize it, saying it's the balance.
[01:01:54.833 --> 01:01:56.554]  You know, it's bringing balance to things.
[01:01:57.494 --> 01:02:03.657]  But continuing with our guest Chris Pinto and David Bay, the makers of Eye of the Phoenix, again, an incredible film.
[01:02:04.257 --> 01:02:10.980]  Continue, Chris Pinto and then David Bay, along these lines, breaking down the film.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.842]  And let's go back into the film itself and what these people, in their own writings, say they believe.
[01:02:18.817 --> 01:02:47.468]  Well, I think a lot of it, what we really tried to show, you know, in the writings, you were talking about the connection with the Theosophical Society, and during this time there were, you had Henry Wallace, who was the Secretary of Agriculture, becomes the Vice President later on, and he was a member of the Theosophical Society, and with him, his spiritual mentor, a guy named Nicholas Rorick, who's been sort of erased from modern history books, but
[01:02:48.032 --> 01:02:55.656]  I was a very central figure back in the 1920s and 30s and was very closely associated with FDR's administration.
[01:02:56.237 --> 01:03:04.541]  And he was seen to be the successor of Madame Blavatsky, who had founded the Theosophical Society in the late 19th century.
[01:03:05.242 --> 01:03:13.506]  And his wife, in fact, Helena Rorick, had translated Blavatsky's book, The Secret Doctrine, into Russian.
[01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:23.626]  So they were very, very closely affiliated with the society and they ended up forming their own new age group called the Agni Yoga Society and so on.
[01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:26.966]  But Rorik was this celebrated international figure.
[01:03:27.547 --> 01:03:28.447]  He was a painter.
[01:03:29.427 --> 01:03:30.968]  He was a philosopher and so on.
[01:03:30.988 --> 01:03:33.448]  He was very deeply involved in the occult.
[01:03:34.229 --> 01:03:42.551]  And as a result, Henry Wallace, who was his pupil, his disciple, became deeply involved in the occult as well.
[01:03:43.195 --> 01:04:02.082]  And Rorick spent years of his life traveling through eastern countries, through Tibet and so on, looking for Shambhala, this legendary, you know, paradise-like kingdom, but also looking for signs of the coming of the Christ, you know, the fifth Buddha, the Maitreya.
[01:04:03.842 --> 01:04:11.185]  And this was a central doctrine in the whole theosophical belief system, but you had major figures, you had guys like Mahatma Gandhi,
[01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:16.132]  And Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, that were both involved in Theosophy.
[01:04:16.813 --> 01:04:22.495]  Thomas Edison, the great inventor who was a member of the House of Theosophy, and so on.
[01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:28.258]  So there were a lot of intellectuals, and the group itself was very political.
[01:04:28.779 --> 01:04:37.223]  It formed the underbelly of the League of Nations, of which Roerich is credited for having been an inspiration of.
[01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:48.589]  And subsequently, when that was dissolved and the UN came together, Rorik has credited his whole philosophies and so on about world peace and world brotherhood.
[01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:58.198]  He was, through his artwork and his writings, amalgamating all the different cultures of the world in his paintings and so on.
[01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:02.783]  So he's combining Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and Mohammed and so on.
[01:05:03.613 --> 01:05:10.559]  And relying upon these universal archetypes as being, you know, different parts of one and the same thing.
[01:05:10.779 --> 01:05:12.441]  Now, this is just their front, though.
[01:05:12.461 --> 01:05:19.526]  I mean, specifically studying them, and you go into that in the film, there's this very dark side, and you find that dark side at the top of the pyramid.
[01:05:20.347 --> 01:05:20.747]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:22.249 --> 01:05:22.629]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:26.292]  Yeah, I think the dark side comes in.
[01:05:26.492 --> 01:05:29.795]  Well, for me, anyway, the dark side comes in with this artifact.
[01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:44.046]  That Rorik claimed to have, this stone that was delivered to him, and that we revealed through the course of the film, was a stone that was said to have fallen from the crown of Lucifer, the Archangel.
[01:05:44.706 --> 01:05:55.952]  And we talk about how the underbelly of Theosophy is really the worship of Lucifer, Satan, declaring that Lucifer is the true God, and Madame Blavatsky and her
[01:05:56.579 --> 01:06:12.249]  writings had talked about the belief of the Theosophists, which was ancient Gnosticism, which goes back to the Garden of Eden, and she uses this phrase, Demon es Deus inversus, meaning the devil is God inverted.
[01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:26.177]  And they switch the roles of God and the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and they declare that God, who created Adam and Eve, was really a devil, because he forbade man to partake of the Tree of Knowledge.
[01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:36.470]  And the serpent was really an angel of light, Lucifer, who came to redeem mankind by getting him to partake of the Tree of Knowledge.
[01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:38.812]  Okay, so they say they're so loving and good.
[01:06:39.192 --> 01:06:42.695]  Why do they love slaughtering and killing whole populations?
[01:06:42.735 --> 01:06:42.935]  Why?
[01:06:42.955 --> 01:06:45.156]  I mean, I guess the Mother Earth needs that.
[01:06:45.176 --> 01:06:47.698]  Well, because they're Luciferians.
[01:06:48.199 --> 01:06:55.244]  We show that both seals are Luciferian and Egyptian in origin.
[01:06:55.865 --> 01:07:13.657]  And, Kerry, and then when we have a couple of experts that break down the symbolism on both sides, and we just proved that the symbolism of the dollar bill is Luciferian to its very core.
[01:07:15.478 --> 01:07:23.984]  What was really interesting to me is not that Nicholas Rorick, who is a channeler and a
[01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:26.375]  I think so.
[01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:43.751]  And that power could move the world into the New World Order.
[01:07:44.071 --> 01:07:53.535]  But what was interesting to me is that Henry Wallace, who is Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President under FDR, believed the same thing.
[01:07:53.875 --> 01:08:03.539]  And then meanwhile, meanwhile, David Bay, you have Hitler, part of the Theosophic Society, running around trying to find different artifacts.
[01:08:03.699 --> 01:08:05.940]  And one of you's got a phone short, whoever's moving that.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.521]  I just may have to switch phones.
[01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:24.395]  That he had to run around and get all these amulets and talismans and the shroud of Turin and the spear that pierced Christ's side and the Holy Grail and Tibet and Nazis digging things up in Tunis and running around.
[01:08:24.695 --> 01:08:35.622]  Whether people believe that this stuff's real or not, the lunatics running things, I've been to Bohemian Grove, I snuck in there, I mean, skull and bones, they really do believe in this.
[01:08:35.662 --> 01:08:36.242]  Please continue.
[01:08:38.128 --> 01:08:59.560]  The thing we try to bring out in this video is that FDR was extremely much like Hitler in the fact that he believed in these same things and he was sending Nicholas Rorick all throughout
[01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:06.234]  You know, the Far East to discover many of the same things that Hitler was.
[01:09:06.254 --> 01:09:10.978]  And so did Stalin, and so did Lenin, and so did the British Royalty.
[01:09:11.138 --> 01:09:11.818]  Right, exactly.
[01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:20.285]  And Tony Blair, today, Skull and Bones, all of these groups are completely and totally obsessed with this.
[01:09:20.725 --> 01:09:21.946]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:09:22.386 --> 01:09:28.531]  But, you know, people do not realize the deep, occult religion
[01:09:29.262 --> 01:09:32.083]  For the lack of a better term, of the FDR administration.
[01:09:32.403 --> 01:09:38.225]  From FDR down to Henry Wallace and... Well, look at Lincoln at seances and channeling.
[01:09:38.905 --> 01:09:39.285]  He did.
[01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:42.306]  His wife is especially deep into that, yeah.
[01:09:42.327 --> 01:09:45.468]  Look at Ronald Reagan!
[01:09:45.768 --> 01:09:46.268]  Hillary!
[01:09:46.608 --> 01:09:51.490]  She bragged that she had seances with Eleanor Roosevelt.
[01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:57.372]  The Roerichs were so deep into this, though.
[01:09:57.412 --> 01:09:58.512]  I think it's interesting.
[01:09:59.045 --> 01:10:07.052]  They were so deep into this that they were claiming in their diaries that they were having objects materialize from the spirit realm.
[01:10:07.432 --> 01:10:12.537]  They were having coins and other things from the spirit realm come into their séances.
[01:10:13.578 --> 01:10:14.479]  And very serious.
[01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:25.028]  I mean, these are people who are international figures that are impacting world government, and they're claiming that these spirits are sending things from the other side to them.
[01:10:26.535 --> 01:10:29.998]  So these were not light-hearted accounts that were given.
[01:10:30.038 --> 01:10:34.481]  These people were deeply involved in the worship of Lucifer.
[01:10:34.741 --> 01:10:38.003]  And they're in control of the nuclear weapons, the bio-weapons.
[01:10:38.023 --> 01:10:41.966]  They're getting everybody's DNA, admittedly, to create race-specific bio-weapons.
[01:10:42.506 --> 01:10:45.208]  They're in control today, and they are going to kill a lot of people, folks.
[01:10:46.829 --> 01:10:47.029]  Yep.
[01:10:48.751 --> 01:10:49.191]  Continue.
[01:10:51.789 --> 01:11:20.694]  So that I felt was a very important thing to prove, because a lot of people, I've seen some Christian ministries even try to defend FDR as possibly being a Christian, because he'll make, you know, he made certain speeches at Christmas or this kind of thing, talking about the birth of Christ and whatnot, and not realizing that as a Mason, and as somebody deeply involved in all this stuff, he would have a completely different view of who Christ was and what he represented and so on.
[01:11:23.841 --> 01:11:43.005]  And also the strong Masonic connection with his entire administration, with him, with Wallace, with the Secretary of Treasury, with a guy named Louis Horch who was financing Nicholas Rorick and built this huge building for him.
[01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:48.866]  Government positions there with FDR and he was a 33rd degree mason.
[01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:51.987]  All of these guys were deeply involved in the society.
[01:11:52.027 --> 01:11:53.927]  Chris Pento, David Bay, gotta break.
[01:11:53.947 --> 01:11:56.428]  Let's come back and go through more of this and get the film.
[01:11:56.608 --> 01:11:58.109]  There's too much to cover here on air.
[01:11:58.129 --> 01:12:00.230]  Eye of the Phoenix at Infowars.com.
[01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:07.914]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:12:07.974 --> 01:12:13.600]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.784]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:20.347]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:26.433]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:12:26.493 --> 01:12:26.993]  I don't know.
[01:12:43.843 --> 01:12:47.304]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:12:47.324 --> 01:12:48.524]  And we knew what to do.
[01:13:12.312 --> 01:13:13.333]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:13:13.574 --> 01:13:19.982]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:13:20.623 --> 01:13:29.135]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:13:29.502 --> 01:13:36.305]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:13:36.605 --> 01:13:39.646]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:13:39.766 --> 01:13:45.009]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:13:45.549 --> 01:13:48.170]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:55.193]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:13:58.439 --> 01:14:07.984]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:14:08.404 --> 01:14:13.827]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:14:14.287 --> 01:14:19.390]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:33.422]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:39.207]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:14:39.507 --> 01:14:45.393]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:47.395]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:47.415 --> 01:14:49.117]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:14:49.137 --> 01:14:49.558]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:49.578 --> 01:14:51.580]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:14:51.601 --> 01:14:51.661]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:06.711]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:15:07.151 --> 01:15:10.434]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:15:10.934 --> 01:15:16.858]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:15:17.238 --> 01:15:21.381]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:27.605]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:30.887]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:15:33.609 --> 01:15:33.989]  I think so.
[01:16:14.617 --> 01:16:22.641]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:16:24.983 --> 01:16:27.784]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[01:16:29.645 --> 01:16:37.590]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:57.612]  One of the biggest issues I've noticed is that the occultists, the Rosicrucians, all these groups, basic same religion, run the atheistic agnostic groups, the humanist groups, and also have infiltrated all the seminaries, they brag about it in their books as you men know.
[01:16:59.798 --> 01:17:06.023]  And they're obsessed with discrediting true Christianity, but then, you know, they're a bunch of occultics.
[01:17:06.103 --> 01:17:08.665]  Why do they accept all the other religions except for that?
[01:17:08.785 --> 01:17:10.526]  I mean, that's a whole other question.
[01:17:10.546 --> 01:17:19.573]  I want to run through some of the other characters in the film, but I also want to spend time on how they, from your research, how they plan on destroying the United States and then rebuilding it to bring in their New World Order.
[01:17:19.613 --> 01:17:23.016]  But please continue with our guests David Bay and Chris Pinto.
[01:17:28.348 --> 01:17:28.688]  Okay.
[01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:32.091]  I think one of the guys is listening to the radio over the internet delay.
[01:17:32.131 --> 01:17:33.431]  That's probably David Bay.
[01:17:33.892 --> 01:17:35.213]  Let's go back to Chris Pinto.
[01:17:35.253 --> 01:17:35.773]  Chris, you there?
[01:17:35.793 --> 01:17:37.554]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:38.555]  Go ahead.
[01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.117]  Okay.
[01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:45.800]  Yeah, again, Eye of the Phoenix is Part 3.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:52.464]  Part 1, we wanted to talk about the foundation of America, going back to England.
[01:17:54.386 --> 01:17:56.987]  The birth of the New Atlantis and viewing it that way.
[01:17:57.047 --> 01:18:05.732]  What was interesting to me was discovering that the very first history of the Great Seal that was written was written by a guy named Charles A.L.
[01:18:05.792 --> 01:18:07.653]  Totten in the 19th century.
[01:18:08.214 --> 01:18:09.995]  And he was an American Army officer.
[01:18:10.795 --> 01:18:17.959]  And he had, when he's writing about the Great Seal, he's writing about the mysteries that are associated with the founding of our Republic.
[01:18:17.979 --> 01:18:18.919]  And there's a lot of them.
[01:18:18.939 --> 01:18:19.880]  There's a lot of really
[01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:35.223]  You know, interesting mythical fairy tales that are told about angels visiting George Washington and mysterious figures coming from out of nowhere and doing certain things to, you know, inspire the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:18:35.283 --> 01:18:36.104]  Providence!
[01:18:37.285 --> 01:18:38.385]  Providence, exactly.
[01:18:39.366 --> 01:18:42.168]  Or so they would call it, but not necessarily all of them.
[01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:49.814]  But Totten in his History of the Great Seal writes about it, and he talks about the birth of America, and he says specifically,
[01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:56.442]  That he believed it was the fulfillment of what Sir Francis Bacon had called the New Atlantis.
[01:18:56.562 --> 01:18:58.963]  So he ties it all together in his history.
[01:18:59.884 --> 01:19:07.868]  And one of the things that we talk about in the film is one of the mysterious origins, or said to be origins, of the Great Seal.
[01:19:08.268 --> 01:19:15.492]  Some people have argued that you can't really know where the Great Seal came from because so many fingers were involved in it, in designing it.
[01:19:16.016 --> 01:19:21.098]  And so they put forth this notion that it came from the spirit realm, that it materialized.
[01:19:21.818 --> 01:19:29.641]  And there's actually a history that's documented in a book, Founding Fathers Secret Societies, by Dr. Robert Hieronymus.
[01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:40.304]  Now, the account might not mean anything, except for the fact that Hieronymus is the leading expert in America, and probably the world, on the history of the Great Seal.
[01:19:40.725 --> 01:19:44.806]  He's the guy whose research is used by the State Department, by the White House,
[01:19:45.767 --> 01:19:58.896]  It was given to Anwar Sadat years ago before he was assassinated when Sadat was inquiring about the Great Seal because he saw the pyramid and he thought there was some connection between Egypt and America as a result.
[01:20:00.337 --> 01:20:13.466]  Anyway, so Dr. Hieronymus records this history where Thomas Jefferson with John Adams and Ben Franklin were supposedly trying to come up with a design for the Great Seal and in their frustration
[01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:34.428]  Jefferson goes outside and some mysterious figure in a dark cloak comes out of nowhere and has this something in a satchel and he hands it to Jefferson and he says, I know you've been struggling to come up with a design, here it is.
[01:20:35.809 --> 01:20:40.252]  And Jefferson supposedly opens this pack up and there's the design for
[01:20:40.854 --> 01:20:48.288]  the great seal of the united states and he goes rushing and tells everybody about it and when he comes back this mysterious figures gone
[01:20:50.476 --> 01:20:53.817]  And it's a really bizarre account, but it's a recorded account.
[01:20:54.137 --> 01:20:59.779]  And there are people who, to this day, claim to believe that that's where the Great Seal originates.
[01:20:59.859 --> 01:21:01.499]  And of course, it doesn't just end there.
[01:21:01.519 --> 01:21:04.620]  And I would say, somebody's got a phone off the hook in an office.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.800]  We keep hearing a woman talk.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.441]  I'm just going to put that on record here, because I'll be able to hear what you guys have to say.
[01:21:09.461 --> 01:21:11.642]  I'm not sure which phone's doing that, so I need to check it.
[01:21:12.487 --> 01:21:19.077]  Um, that there's a cultic symbolism all over D.C., all over the world, and all over the other money as well.
[01:21:19.157 --> 01:21:20.178]  It's just everywhere.
[01:21:20.679 --> 01:21:21.200]  They're upset.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:28.631]  I mean, the National Press Club symbolism is the staff of the wizard, the little owl, the eternal flame of Bohemian Grove.
[01:21:30.003 --> 01:21:30.823]  It just goes on and on.
[01:21:30.843 --> 01:21:37.947]  So let's talk about that, gentlemen, when we come back and take some phone calls and what their great plan is from your deep research on this subject.
[01:21:37.967 --> 01:21:38.968]  It's just an amazing film.
[01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:45.291]  You can go up to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlot.com, watch the trailer, and I hope folks will get Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[01:21:45.311 --> 01:21:51.114]  This is something that will really wake people up, especially Christians and agnostics, to the fact that there's an occult agenda going on.
[01:21:54.335 --> 01:21:55.216]  We're on the march.
[01:21:55.716 --> 01:21:57.217]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:01.097]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:05.308 --> 01:22:06.371]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke.
[01:22:10.333 --> 01:22:12.955]  Three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:21.422]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:22:21.942 --> 01:22:29.588]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[01:22:30.008 --> 01:22:36.573]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[01:22:37.054 --> 01:22:38.415]  Food is an everyday need.
[01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:44.184]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[01:22:44.665 --> 01:22:46.707]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:51.311]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:22:51.671 --> 01:22:54.354]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:54.394 --> 01:22:56.716]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:04.269 --> 01:23:10.671]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:11.031 --> 01:23:13.012]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:13.672 --> 01:23:14.693]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:15.233 --> 01:23:15.733]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:16.013 --> 01:23:16.913]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:16.933 --> 01:23:18.314]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:18.374 --> 01:23:20.054]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:20.374 --> 01:23:27.137]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:27.537 --> 01:23:27.957]  Some U.S.
[01:23:28.017 --> 01:23:33.659]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:34.359 --> 01:23:37.882]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:38.242 --> 01:23:40.664]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:04.628 --> 01:24:05.489]  Detoxify.
[01:24:05.569 --> 01:24:10.032]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:24:10.172 --> 01:24:15.937]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:24:16.157 --> 01:24:19.880]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective keelermats.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:25.044]  With the help of Nutri-A-Dine, Keeler Max will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[01:24:25.164 --> 01:24:30.728]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[01:24:30.888 --> 01:24:34.830]  Add Malignabla to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:39.474]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[01:24:39.694 --> 01:24:46.198]  And Nutra-Trala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[01:24:46.358 --> 01:24:48.580]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:48.880]  I think.
[01:25:16.875 --> 01:25:18.676]  I have a Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[01:25:18.696 --> 01:25:20.676]  Your phone call's coming up in a few minutes.
[01:25:20.696 --> 01:25:24.918]  I've got to have our guest back on for a more in-depth interview because there's just so much to learn here.
[01:25:25.618 --> 01:25:32.601]  Again, I came upon researching the New World Order just from a secular position, looking at what the elites believe and are pushing, and...
[01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.782]  These are horrible creatures.
[01:25:35.642 --> 01:25:39.444]  And they have a lot of well-meaning idiot camp followers that buy into the whole New Age thing.
[01:25:39.464 --> 01:25:40.464]  There's nothing new about it.
[01:25:41.165 --> 01:25:45.127]  Let's hit some of the other key areas of the Eye of the Phoenix.
[01:25:45.747 --> 01:25:51.190]  And perhaps I should go back to David Bay for his take on some of the things that Chris Pinto was just saying.
[01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:57.212]  But then also, I want to go back to Chris Pinto because the way these films are made, I mean, this is shot with actors, it's lit great.
[01:25:57.793 --> 01:25:59.474]  I don't know how you guys do it for the budget you have.
[01:25:59.494 --> 01:26:00.814]  It's just an amazing feat.
[01:26:01.074 --> 01:26:02.055]  And to do it three times.
[01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.488]  The credit for that all goes to Chris.
[01:26:08.528 --> 01:26:18.973]  He's an accomplished filmmaker, and once he became a Christian, he realized he couldn't work for Hollywood, so now he's using his skills for us.
[01:26:19.033 --> 01:26:24.856]  So that credit all goes to him.
[01:26:25.856 --> 01:26:32.880]  But one of the major points comes at the end of the film, where we disclose that there is a direct link
[01:26:33.499 --> 01:26:57.278]  Between the symbolism of the all-seeing eye of Lucifer hovering over the unfinished pyramid, which is the developing New World Order, and the Masonic plan to rebuild the Solomon's Temple for their Christ, and when the Christ arises, he will symbolically replace the eye atop the pyramid, thus completing the pyramid.
[01:26:57.738 --> 01:26:59.279]  So back in 1782, when this design was created,
[01:27:03.106 --> 01:27:14.252]  The Masons at the time, and the Masons today, plan to rebuild that third temple for their Christ, and that symbolism is on the dollar bill.
[01:27:14.332 --> 01:27:27.239]  And they have the Israeli Supreme Court building with the big all-seeing eyes, and they've infiltrated Christianity and changed things to a pre-tribulation rapture, and so the Christian church is ready to accept the first Christ as the Christ.
[01:27:28.195 --> 01:27:29.156]  Exactly right.
[01:27:29.276 --> 01:27:30.096]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:30.136 --> 01:27:37.279]  And that's a warning that we issue in Riddles and Stones, or the end of that documentary.
[01:27:37.859 --> 01:27:54.527]  But the point is that this plan to globalize the world and then stage their cries, this plan has been in existence since at least their founding fathers, and we show in
[01:27:55.931 --> 01:28:06.380]  In the New Atlantis, the first video, the plan goes all the way back to Sir Francis Bacon in Queen Elizabeth in England in the 1580s and 1590s.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.982]  So this is a long-running plan.
[01:28:11.343 --> 01:28:14.046]  It's just amazing to see it unfolding now.
[01:28:14.426 --> 01:28:20.451]  The Luciferians, Mr. Pinto, they believe that they are now in the final phase, correct?
[01:28:22.078 --> 01:28:22.839]  I think they do.
[01:28:22.859 --> 01:28:33.725]  I mean, you've had these guys coming out for years, stating that their world teacher, their Maitreya, their global messiah, is getting ready to merge at any moment.
[01:28:33.826 --> 01:28:37.508]  I mean, back in FDR's era, they believed that was the case.
[01:28:37.608 --> 01:28:48.394]  This guy, Krishnamurti, who I think you mentioned earlier, was the guy that the House of Theosophy believed was going to be the Christ figure, and then he came out and said, no, it's not me.
[01:28:49.315 --> 01:28:50.656]  Then you had Benjamin Creme,
[01:28:51.266 --> 01:28:58.871]  Who for more than 20 years, almost 30 years now, has been going forth announcing that the Maitreya would appear at any moment.
[01:28:59.011 --> 01:29:08.097]  And this Maitreya is the same, you know, 5th Buddha Christ figure that they were anticipating during FDR's administration.
[01:29:08.377 --> 01:29:12.940]  And Lucius Trust, now Lucius Trust, has a little prayer area at the UN in New York.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.121]  I mean, this is their religion.
[01:29:15.021 --> 01:29:16.322]  Yeah, the meditation room.
[01:29:16.642 --> 01:29:20.765]  If anybody goes to the UN, I've been to the meditation room in the United Nations building.
[01:29:21.275 --> 01:29:21.575]  It is.
[01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:36.282]  I mean, it is a very occult room that they put together, and if you go on their website and read about it, it's just, it's very plain that it was designed based on occult principles in no uncertain way.
[01:29:37.462 --> 01:29:39.703]  But yeah, they've been anticipating this figure.
[01:29:39.763 --> 01:29:47.807]  In fact, Benjamin Krem, back in November, Cher International, his group, sent out some email and some news announcement
[01:29:48.442 --> 01:30:09.849]  Now that it was actually after the election, once Obama won the election, within a month they sent some press release announcing that Matreo was going to emerge, that he was going to be interviewed by some world-famous journalist or something, and that all of these miraculous and wondrous things were going to be happening in the coming years, supposedly this year.
[01:30:11.029 --> 01:30:15.091]  But Krem has been saying this kind of thing for many years, so who knows what's going to happen.
[01:30:17.122 --> 01:30:20.566]  But yes, they think the time is nigh.
[01:30:20.626 --> 01:30:30.240]  They believe they are right on the edge of this whole New World Order coming about and their world teacher coming forward.
[01:30:30.816 --> 01:30:31.717]  Bunch of lunatics.
[01:30:32.718 --> 01:30:40.203]  I want to go to some phone calls, but I want to tell listeners who haven't gotten the first two in the series, we have all three at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:30:40.283 --> 01:30:49.891]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings Volume 1, Riddles in Stone, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings 2, and now the third, Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[01:30:50.631 --> 01:30:56.096]  If memory serves me right, you guys wanted to make one film early on, but you understood it was such a saga, such a history,
[01:30:57.317 --> 01:30:58.818]  There were originally going to be four.
[01:30:58.879 --> 01:31:02.522]  If we can find the funding for it, the material has blossomed into seven.
[01:31:18.971 --> 01:31:32.238]  So, we'll just have to wait and see how things progress, but there is so much material that we need to talk about, relating to the secret mysteries of America's beginnings, that it could take seven volumes to tell the whole story.
[01:31:33.058 --> 01:31:40.882]  It's real education, because I've done a lot of research, and I even learned a lot of new stuff I didn't know, watching this film, and it's also all very well documented.
[01:31:41.203 --> 01:31:45.425]  I want to take a few calls here, but any other key points you guys want to make about the film?
[01:31:46.853 --> 01:31:51.416]  Did you notice the bohemian owl that we talked about all over that dollar bill?
[01:31:51.776 --> 01:31:52.057]  Yes.
[01:31:52.477 --> 01:31:53.898]  Tell us about that little fellow.
[01:31:54.958 --> 01:32:03.744]  Well, hidden in a couple different places on the dollar bill, there is an owl that is identical to the bohemian grove owl.
[01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:13.410]  And we have a short segment in there about the bohemian grove, which ties in exactly with your DVD on that subject.
[01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:15.392]  I found it very interesting that
[01:32:16.539 --> 01:32:19.730]  That the documentary, that the fact the documentary took that turn.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.081]  Yeah, well, you know, people say to me, oh, the owl isn't Moloch.
[01:32:24.201 --> 01:32:31.003]  I understand that that was symbolized in Tyre as a bull, and other areas as a ram, other animals.
[01:32:31.923 --> 01:32:35.304]  But the cultists always give two, three, four, five, ten meanings.
[01:32:35.684 --> 01:32:41.886]  They address it as the owl of Bohemia, and then on their own literature, they address it as Moloch.
[01:32:42.267 --> 01:32:45.828]  When I was there at the ritual, infiltrating it in July of 2000,
[01:32:47.268 --> 01:32:47.889]  They addressed it.
[01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:51.012]  First they said the spirits of all our dead GROW members are here.
[01:32:51.492 --> 01:32:52.833]  Then they addressed it as a female.
[01:32:52.853 --> 01:32:54.034]  Then they addressed it as a male.
[01:32:54.054 --> 01:32:56.817]  I mean, this goes into their religion.
[01:32:57.398 --> 01:33:00.580]  And a lot of the occultists out there like to, you know, pick at us.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.264]  You know, like, we're not allowed to talk about this and all their mumbo-jumbo garbage.
[01:33:04.324 --> 01:33:06.526]  But any comments on that?
[01:33:08.007 --> 01:33:10.630]  Well, the... Go ahead, Chris.
[01:33:11.531 --> 01:33:15.914]  I was just going to make the comment, Alex, just to follow up on the whole owl bohemian growth thing.
[01:33:16.274 --> 01:33:22.679]  One of the things that we show in the film is the presence of the owl throughout Washington, D.C.
[01:33:23.199 --> 01:33:27.402]  If you go in the government buildings, if you go in the Library of Congress, in the U.S.
[01:33:27.462 --> 01:33:36.989]  Capitol and so on, you will find little owls carved into, you know, the most remote places inside D.C.
[01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:38.390]  I mean, they're all over the place.
[01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:40.612]  I believe those are spiritual guardians.
[01:33:41.718 --> 01:33:52.344]  Yeah, practicing occultism believed that a particularly powerful kind of familiar spirit takes the form of an owl.
[01:33:53.225 --> 01:33:56.947]  And the owl was Sir Francis Bacon's favorite familiar spirit.
[01:33:57.847 --> 01:34:01.550]  And so it's been popular all down through the centuries since.
[01:34:02.715 --> 01:34:07.416]  Yeah, I had pretty high-level masons, you know, here in Texas, in my family lineage.
[01:34:08.536 --> 01:34:13.917]  And, you know, in these old farmhouses and places, there's little, you know, bronze and cast iron little owls.
[01:34:14.257 --> 01:34:14.897]  Great.
[01:34:15.177 --> 01:34:26.499]  Yeah, that's a familiar spirit that comes and guides them, and gives them encouragement, and gives them guidance for their life, and that kind of thing.
[01:34:26.779 --> 01:34:31.620]  And, of course, the Bible says that we are to not have any contact with familiar spirits.
[01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:45.603]  So, but it's a representative of this Luciferian religion that all of the Masons and Rosicrucians and other members of secret societies follow.
[01:34:46.144 --> 01:34:59.846]  If people really got a hold in their mind that our government leaders are, you know, these Masons and these Rosicrucians are practicing a cultist and are following a cult plan that follows Bible prophecy,
[01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:05.160]  That would revolutionize the opposition to the New World Order.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.420]  And that's what the Bible says.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.801]  It says they have their counterfeit, and the occultists go, no, this is the Christ.
[01:35:11.102 --> 01:35:12.882]  You know, look, we wrote your Bible.
[01:35:12.922 --> 01:35:14.342]  I mean, it's just such deception.
[01:35:14.362 --> 01:35:15.743]  It's just amazing.
[01:35:16.723 --> 01:35:17.143]  Yes, it is.
[01:35:17.223 --> 01:35:17.783]  It's amazing.
[01:35:18.363 --> 01:35:28.546]  But the exciting part of it for us is that this all comes down, and they are aiming for the very thing the Bible says will happen, and that is a
[01:35:30.353 --> 01:35:39.943]  A Christ figure that will claim to be Jesus Christ and all the world's religions, and will take control of a global government, a global economy, and a global religion.
[01:35:40.123 --> 01:35:47.210]  Well, look at how the last two popes are calling for a one-rule government, and I have video of them joining hands with all the other religions.
[01:35:47.791 --> 01:35:50.153]  I mean, they're all pushing for this.
[01:35:51.094 --> 01:35:51.234]  Yeah.
[01:35:52.611 --> 01:36:06.215]  The Illuminati back in 1991 made a decision that the Roman Catholic Pope, whomever he was at the time, would become the top religious leader of the New World Order religion.
[01:36:06.855 --> 01:36:10.116]  And so the Pope is right in the thick of things.
[01:36:10.737 --> 01:36:10.977]  Yeah.
[01:36:11.697 --> 01:36:12.157]  All right.
[01:36:12.458 --> 01:36:15.298]  Well, we have all three of the films available at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:15.318 --> 01:36:19.380]  I hope you'll call and get it as well if you're not online.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:25.402]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, Eye of the Phoenix.
[01:36:26.102 --> 01:36:27.542]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:36:27.762 --> 01:36:31.944]  Ron in Arizona, you're on the air with the two co-directors of Eye of the Phoenix.
[01:36:33.404 --> 01:36:34.605]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:36:36.585 --> 01:36:47.670]  If we're living in the last days and a new world order will be established, as the Bible says, should we resist it no matter what?
[01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:49.911]  Because the Bible says we should do that.
[01:36:50.311 --> 01:36:55.494]  Proverbs 24, 25 says that those who rebuke the wicked will be blessed.
[01:36:56.374 --> 01:37:00.016]  Those who keep the law strive against the wicked, Proverbs 28, 4.
[01:37:01.476 --> 01:37:04.558]  And if the righteous gives way before the wicked,
[01:37:05.492 --> 01:37:08.894]  They are like a muddy spring or a polluted well, Proverbs 25, 26.
[01:37:09.094 --> 01:37:19.400]  And then Ephesians 5, 11 says that instead of participating in the deeds of the wicked, we're supposed to expose them.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:25.844]  And then Paul said in verse 14, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
[01:37:26.684 --> 01:37:30.006]  Any comments on that, Alex and Mr. Pennell, Mr. Bay?
[01:37:30.026 --> 01:37:33.948]  I think we should resist.
[01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.770]  I agree.
[01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:49.641]  Right now we can resist legally and write letters and call our congressmen and do all the talk as a million man voice.
[01:37:49.842 --> 01:37:50.482]  I think we should.
[01:37:50.722 --> 01:37:51.403]  I think we should.
[01:37:51.423 --> 01:37:51.943]  I think we should.
[01:37:52.684 --> 01:38:02.592]  But as a Christian ministry, we strive to use our events of the coming New World Order to get people to come to Christ.
[01:38:03.055 --> 01:38:05.218]  But if they are saved, they're going to be fighting evil.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.423]  Yeah, we have to fight evil, no matter what.
[01:38:09.463 --> 01:38:14.510]  I mean, it is grace that comes first, but the evidence of that is that you're going to fight evil.
[01:38:15.742 --> 01:38:17.803]  Because we're commanded to throughout the Bible.
[01:38:17.823 --> 01:38:19.084]  These are just a handful.
[01:38:19.104 --> 01:38:27.148]  Yeah, but if you're really fighting evil, I mean, if you're really right with God, you're not going to be able to control yourself if you're going to want to help people and fight evil and stand up against corruption.
[01:38:27.849 --> 01:38:29.129]  And you're not going to be a coward.
[01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:34.032]  And I'm telling you, I go in these churches and I feel an evil, I mean, it's evil.
[01:38:34.412 --> 01:38:36.153]  Most of these big churches, it is evil.
[01:38:36.173 --> 01:38:38.395]  I go in there and I feel evil.
[01:38:39.675 --> 01:38:40.796]  Because it is evil.
[01:38:41.136 --> 01:38:42.097]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:42.457 --> 01:38:44.398]  You guys want to comment on that, Mr. Pinto or anybody?
[01:38:45.302 --> 01:38:53.266]  Yeah, I just wanted to say one of my favorite scriptures has to do with John the Baptist and how and why John the Baptist was arrested.
[01:38:53.286 --> 01:39:02.871]  He was arrested not just for speaking out against King Herod's adultery, but the scripture says he lifted up a shout against all the evil that Herod had done.
[01:39:02.891 --> 01:39:07.033]  He had been speaking against all the evil that Herod was guilty of.
[01:39:07.498 --> 01:39:12.642]  And I think that's part of what we're doing in these films, and it's part of what we believe is the right thing to do.
[01:39:12.722 --> 01:39:20.909]  God's prophets and wise men and followers have always spoken out against evil in the land whenever a king or a queen or whoever was given over to it.
[01:39:21.809 --> 01:39:27.551]  Yeah, well like Ezekiel said and others, they were threatened to kill him and he said, I can't help it, my bones are burning, I've got to do this.
[01:39:28.311 --> 01:39:40.136]  And people don't have a compulsion, a drive, an overwhelming need to fight evil and defend all these innocents that are being slaughtered and enslaved and the captives, then you are in league with the force of this world.
[01:39:40.436 --> 01:39:41.036]  Period!
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.503]  And Jesus said that to whom much is given, much will be required.
[01:39:46.003 --> 01:39:51.888]  So for those of us who know the truth and know the truth behind the truth, it's incumbent upon us to resist.
[01:39:52.608 --> 01:39:53.108]  Absolutely.
[01:39:53.148 --> 01:39:54.790]  Let's talk to Wilson in New York.
[01:39:55.210 --> 01:39:56.671]  Wilson, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:39:57.332 --> 01:39:57.632]  Yes.
[01:39:57.652 --> 01:39:58.673]  Good evening, gentlemen.
[01:39:59.273 --> 01:40:05.498]  I just want to thank you guys for being able to bring together all the information and make it so understandable.
[01:40:06.258 --> 01:40:09.601]  And I also want to thank you, Alex Jones, for taking me out of my
[01:40:10.734 --> 01:40:19.278]  Dream state of just smoking every day and you turn me into someone who just is in a drive for information and trying to understand things.
[01:40:19.918 --> 01:40:23.800]  And things like the eye of the phoenix do help me understand things easier.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:25.621]  So I just have one question.
[01:40:25.641 --> 01:40:32.544]  The movie, I'm actually reading the book though, Angels and Demons talks about a lot of information.
[01:40:32.564 --> 01:40:37.086]  I was curious if any of that information could be true.
[01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:44.772]  You're talking about the book they're turning into the film about the Illuminati and all that?
[01:40:45.153 --> 01:40:47.193]  Yeah, with Tom Hanks, by Dan Brown.
[01:40:47.533 --> 01:40:56.376]  Yeah, that's really all twisted, because it says there's the Illuminati, but it's fighting Christianity and the Catholic Church, when really all those major institutions are working together.
[01:40:56.456 --> 01:40:57.597]  Gentlemen, do you have comments on that?
[01:40:59.217 --> 01:41:01.418]  I haven't really studied that book.
[01:41:02.819 --> 01:41:03.519]  I couldn't comment.
[01:41:04.383 --> 01:41:08.784]  Well, I mean, you find out in the first one that, you know, it really is the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail's the goddess.
[01:41:08.844 --> 01:41:09.704]  It's just very occultic.
[01:41:11.645 --> 01:41:14.825]  ...about the New World Order and Bilderberg, so none of that.
[01:41:15.405 --> 01:41:27.428]  I should take seriously... Well, you know, the Illuminati love to jump in and muddy the waters and, you know, take control of dissident groups or write a book that is partly true and partly false.
[01:41:28.475 --> 01:41:32.097]  They love to do things like this, maybe that kind of a thing.
[01:41:32.237 --> 01:41:34.818]  Okay, sir, I've only read a synopsis of the book and the film.
[01:41:35.219 --> 01:41:36.019]  I read the first one.
[01:41:36.059 --> 01:41:38.840]  I listened to it on a book on tape because I wanted to understand it.
[01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:43.823]  Let me guess, they say the Catholic Church is fighting the Illuminati in the book?
[01:41:47.945 --> 01:41:54.348]  Did they explain that Adam Weissamt came out of a Jesuit college in Ingolstadt?
[01:41:55.856 --> 01:42:04.683]  That he began as a Jesuit and he used the methodology of the Jesuit order to found the Illuminati.
[01:42:05.163 --> 01:42:16.492]  But all I'm asking is, exactly, specifically, does the book from the synopsis I read, and maybe I should read it, I'm so busy, it says here's the Illuminati, here's the Catholic Church, the two are fighting, is that the message?
[01:42:17.553 --> 01:42:24.399]  They say that the Catholic Church doesn't like the Illuminati because they were coming from a different standpoint and they had people like Galileo
[01:42:25.037 --> 01:42:26.940]  Another scientist, like that.
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.344]  So that's basically why they say they're against each other.
[01:42:29.705 --> 01:42:31.027]  And why the Illuminati... Exactly!
[01:42:31.067 --> 01:42:39.360]  The Catholic Church is backwards and bad, and wanted to go after Galileo, so in a way the Illuminati's the good guys?
[01:42:43.443 --> 01:42:46.725]  I mean, I haven't read the book yet, sir, so I appreciate your call, Wilson.
[01:42:47.146 --> 01:42:48.126]  I can't really comment.
[01:42:48.146 --> 01:42:50.408]  I've only read the synopsis, but I'll find out more.
[01:42:50.468 --> 01:42:51.228]  It's about to come out.
[01:42:51.268 --> 01:42:54.350]  I just don't like watching movies like that, but I'll try to track it.
[01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:58.393]  We're going to come back, take one final call from Jeff in Canada for our guest.
[01:42:58.913 --> 01:43:01.795]  The video is the Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[01:43:02.235 --> 01:43:03.956]  Get it at Infowars.com.

[01:43:15.844 --> 01:43:17.565]  That's right.

[01:43:21.187 --> 01:43:24.789]  That's only 92 cents per person for each meal.

[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:41.200]  No fillers.
[01:43:42.537 --> 01:43:43.138]  I think so.
[01:44:04.176 --> 01:44:16.884]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:44:17.325 --> 01:44:24.089]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:44:24.389 --> 01:44:24.609]  We're good.
[01:44:48.134 --> 01:44:48.695]  I'm good.
[01:45:03.837 --> 01:45:09.000]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:18.224]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:45:18.464 --> 01:45:21.846]  Did you know that most multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:45:21.886 --> 01:45:22.246]  I think so.
[01:45:43.826 --> 01:45:46.527]  Visit tobenatural.com.

[01:46:06.932 --> 01:46:09.574]  All right, we're going to go right back to our guests, take a final call or two.
[01:46:09.594 --> 01:46:18.038]  We've got to have Mr. Bay and Mr. Pinto back up in the near future, because I know there's a lot more people who want to talk to them and pick their brain with all this important knowledge.
[01:46:18.319 --> 01:46:22.281]  Remember, our sponsors like survivalseedbank.com make this radio show possible.
[01:46:22.601 --> 01:46:28.705]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow your own endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:46:29.685 --> 01:46:34.809]  And there's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:46:34.849 --> 01:46:36.330]  Governments are storing seeds, the U.N.
[01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:37.670]  storing them in these big seed banks.
[01:46:38.051 --> 01:46:43.214]  They're buying up the non-hybrid, non-GMO seed stocks and literally not selling them to the public.
[01:46:43.634 --> 01:46:45.276]  So it's important to rediscover all this.
[01:46:45.296 --> 01:46:47.177]  They have high quality seeds at great prices.
[01:46:47.497 --> 01:46:49.638]  Survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:46:49.658 --> 01:46:49.739]  877-327-0365.
[01:46:49.779 --> 01:46:51.500]  Fabulous folks at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:59.925 --> 01:47:03.167]  You know, if you're not going to learn how to garden and learn how to grow food, I think you should do that.
[01:47:03.187 --> 01:47:12.371]  But at the same time, you should also check out efoodsdirect.com, the best storable foods company out there, where I get it non-GMO, clean, healthy, good food, very low price.
[01:47:12.391 --> 01:47:17.573]  They have a three-day responder, three-day supply for like $21.95 as a test of their high-quality food.
[01:47:18.013 --> 01:47:21.095]  efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:47:24.056 --> 01:47:28.199]  Give them a call, get a free catalog, go to eFoodsDirect.com, watch the introductory videos they have there.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:29.901]  eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[01:47:29.921 --> 01:47:34.164]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:47:34.505 --> 01:47:35.425]  We're almost out of time.
[01:47:35.465 --> 01:47:40.610]  Let's take a call from Jeff in Canada for our guest, the makers of the Eye of the Phoenix.
[01:47:42.311 --> 01:47:43.592]  Hi Alex, it's Jeff.
[01:47:44.413 --> 01:47:49.377]  I have been a long-time supporter of yours and I think you're having an excellent discussion today.
[01:47:50.117 --> 01:47:52.079]  I know time is short, so I'll get right to it.
[01:47:52.714 --> 01:48:01.799]  Your guests mentioned that the American dollar is meant to perish like the phoenix and then rise up again in a new form, and I just wanted to put this out there as an insight.
[01:48:02.779 --> 01:48:08.942]  Perhaps they're thinking that that one world currency will actually be in the form of carbon credits.
[01:48:09.483 --> 01:48:09.723]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:09.763 --> 01:48:17.627]  Because you've mentioned we're moving to a cashless society, and how better to regulate people than link everything to carbon credits.
[01:48:17.987 --> 01:48:19.608]  And that goes into the Gaia worship.
[01:48:19.648 --> 01:48:21.629]  Let's get a comment from our guest on that fine point.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:25.100]  It's possible.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:36.044]  I mean, it's clearly possible, and I think Obama is going to be the man that is going to shepherd America through that whole process.
[01:48:36.064 --> 01:48:37.184]  Well, that's what Kissinger said.
[01:48:37.224 --> 01:48:39.345]  He's going to bring in the new world order.
[01:48:39.365 --> 01:48:40.005]  Mr. Pinto?
[01:48:41.666 --> 01:48:45.727]  You know, I haven't studied the carbon credit thing enough to really comment on that specifically.
[01:48:45.787 --> 01:48:47.628]  I'm still wondering if they're going to
[01:48:48.706 --> 01:48:54.730]  You know, if they're going to somehow or other initiate the North American Union and then bring in the Amaro or something similar.
[01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:56.511]  Yeah, they're going to go in three blocks first.
[01:48:56.551 --> 01:48:57.051]  Great point.
[01:48:57.271 --> 01:48:57.831]  Thank you, Jeff.
[01:48:57.871 --> 01:48:59.352]  TJ and Novato, we just hung up.
[01:48:59.512 --> 01:49:00.613]  I'm not going to go to anybody else then.
[01:49:00.893 --> 01:49:01.573]  Anything else, Jeff?
[01:49:03.635 --> 01:49:04.235]  Okay, thank you.
[01:49:04.895 --> 01:49:07.197]  Gentlemen, I want to thank you both for coming on the show.
[01:49:07.277 --> 01:49:09.898]  Each of you, a closing one-minute comment or 30-second comment.
[01:49:09.918 --> 01:49:11.319]  Go ahead, David.
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:18.003]  Well, this Eye of the Phoenix documentary tells the story
[01:49:18.553 --> 01:49:34.787]  That the Masonic and Rosicrucian secret societies and their modern day descendants like Skull and Bones have originally, from the time before America was founded, planned to use America as the
[01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:56.869]  As the powerful, prosperous nation to lead the world, the rest of the world, into this global government economy and religion, and then stage their Masonic Messiah, and all that symbolism is found on the dollar bill, and as we say in the show in Riddles and Stones, the same story is in the street layouts and the paintings and the sculptures of Washington, D.C.
[01:49:57.049 --> 01:49:57.750]  Absolutely.
[01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:59.990]  Closing comments quickly, Mr. Pinto.
[01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:05.852]  Well, I think the fascinating part of this whole thing for me was how the Great Pyramid symbolizes
[01:50:06.437 --> 01:50:15.096]  Solomon's rebuilt temple in the city of Jerusalem and part of what we show at the end of the film is how you've got Orthodox Jews and Freemasons
[01:50:15.515 --> 01:50:22.341]  Working to rebuild the temple there in Jerusalem in fulfillment of the appearance of their Christ figure.
[01:50:22.601 --> 01:50:23.222]  That's right, Chris.
[01:50:23.262 --> 01:50:24.082]  All the symbolism.
[01:50:24.403 --> 01:50:27.485]  Chris Pinto, David May, we'll talk to you very soon from Cutting Edge Ministries.
[01:50:27.785 --> 01:50:28.866]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:50:28.886 --> 01:50:29.947]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:30.468 --> 01:50:30.708]  You bet.
[01:50:30.728 --> 01:50:33.150]  All three films are available right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:37.854]  Retransmission starts now with a bunch of key info with the gun confiscation bills now moving.
[01:50:38.294 --> 01:50:40.316]  Eric Holder openly announcing in ABC News.
[01:50:40.336 --> 01:50:43.198]  We'll be back in one minute covering that at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:43.218 --> 01:50:43.799]  God bless you all.
[01:50:45.618 --> 01:50:47.459]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:48.879 --> 01:50:51.180]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:54.001 --> 01:50:54.582]  Hello, friends.
[01:50:54.642 --> 01:50:55.582]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:50:55.702 --> 01:51:00.284]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:00.444 --> 01:51:03.185]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:03.405 --> 01:51:06.266]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:06.446 --> 01:51:11.168]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:11.388 --> 01:51:12.329]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:12.509 --> 01:51:15.491]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:22.657]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
