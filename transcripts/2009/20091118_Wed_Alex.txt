[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.069]  T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.933]  George Humphrey is our guest of The Balance of the Hour.
[00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:24.461]  He popped by the office last week to get some more copies of Fall of the Republic, my new documentary film that he's a big part of, one of our economists that we have in there, breaking the facts down.
[00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.264]  I think we have three economists in the film, and you're one of the most informative.
[00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.247]  And I said, why not just come in for most of an hour next week?
[00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:33.488]  And we're very honored.
[00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:34.889]  to have him with us.
[00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:45.132]  He is a degreed economist, very successful businessman, former Austin City Councilman, author, filmmaker, and he's been somebody fighting the New World Order longer than I have been.
[00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:46.992]  He's been fighting it, what, 18 years or so.
[00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:53.994]  Two years before I got on air, 14 years ago, I'd met George at some functions and events when I was just trying to understand what was happening.
[00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:58.515]  So he's been certainly a mentor to me, helping me along, and we've all grown together.
[00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:00.175]  George, it's great to have you here.
[00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:04.255]  As always, as I said last week, it's an honor to be here.
[00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:05.576]  And you know what?
[00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:08.137]  Not only is it an honor, it's fun to be here.
[00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:10.678]  It's fun to be at the center of the storm.
[00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:13.500]  It's fun to be fighting the good fight.
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.781]  It's fun to be making new friends.
[00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:18.242]  It's fun to be talking about the truth.
[00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:24.805]  It's fun to be working for a better world and a better America and a better family and a better self.
[00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:27.006]  And so thanks a lot for letting me be here.
[00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:29.546]  Well, George, it's awesome having you here with us.
[00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.607]  I want to cover a lot of subjects because you're knowledgeable on them all.
[00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:37.910]  And, of course, you've done your own local TV show here as well and done a lot of radio, so you can speak on all these issues.
[00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.273]  First off, as an economist, can you explain to people how fractional reserve banking works in a nutshell?
[00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.894]  How more debt is created than physical assets?
[00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:52.277]  How this financial engineered system is the key to the globalist power because they control the issuance of currency and credit?
[00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:55.278]  Well, we'll boil it down to about one minute.
[00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:59.660]  And what you need to remember is the initials O-T-A.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.180]  O-T-A.
[00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:02.981]  Out of thin air.
[00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:04.862]  And back in 1776,
[00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:32.333]  Rothschild, when he helped start the Illuminati, they realized that by creating fractional reserve banking is that they could convince the people of the nation to put in their gold and silver and assets and give them a script or a piece of paper that said that they had it.
[00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:35.876]  And then they would make loans based upon this script.
[00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:48.185]  Now, as time went on, the reserves that were backing the deposits got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.
[00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:52.128]  Now, our founding fathers were very, very hip to this.
[00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:54.029]  Each and every one of our founding fathers.
[00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.016]  That's why they put in Article 1, Section 7 and Article 1, Section 9, that our banking system had to have gold and silver as a backing.
[00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:04.858]  It was to be controlled by the public.
[00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:12.043]  And that money was supposed to have real value and not just be a commodity.
[00:03:12.343 --> 00:03:19.929]  And of course, this has been the central fight within our nation from 1776 through today.
[00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.733]  And Washington and Jefferson and Madison and Thomas Paine all talked about it.
[00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:32.416]  And then John Quincy Adams talked about it, Andrew Jackson talked about it, and they tried to kill and assassinate him five times.
[00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.077]  Abraham Lincoln came in.
[00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:36.218]  This has always been the main threat to our country.
[00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:40.036]  Number one threat, because whoever, follow the money.
[00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:50.160]  When I first got elected on the city council, I think it was, I forgot who it was, but they came into my office and he said, always follow the money.
[00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:53.782]  And this is in little bitty Austin politics.
[00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:59.745]  And so when you wanted to find out what was going on, and I woke, I got very hip to that very quick.
[00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:05.088]  Always follow the money, because that is the way the puppet masters control us.
[00:04:05.748 --> 00:04:07.209]  Through the money, number one.
[00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:34.443]  And so then through Abraham Lincoln, and McKinley, and Ford, and then up to John F. Kennedy, and now to Dr. Ron Paul, we are all talking about the discrepancy between what the Constitution says and where we're supposed to have a currency, a banking system that's controlled by the people, backed by gold and silver, a hard currency,
[00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:38.939]  Versus what we have, which is the Federal Reserve Banking Act.
[00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:44.021]  And of course, as all of you know by now, it's not federal, there's no reserves.
[00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:46.742]  Hey George, that's a big deal!
[00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:49.503]  Ten years ago, you couldn't say, as you all know.
[00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:55.765]  Now, in major polls, 75-80% know it's private, want it abolished or audited.
[00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:57.606]  I mean, we've had a complete flip.
[00:04:57.986 --> 00:05:00.987]  I mean, what, 10-15 years ago, maybe 5% of people knew?
[00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:03.968]  Now, I mean, look, we've had huge success, thank God!
[00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:19.624]  I am so glad you brought that up, because 15 years ago, when I talked about this, I had to speak it with a very hushed voice, and show all the numbers, and show everything, and people's eyes would get real wide.
[00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:22.406]  You're saying, there's nothing behind our money system?
[00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:25.128]  The Federal Reserve is not a government agency?
[00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:29.091]  And now, almost everybody knows it.
[00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:34.449]  The people at Starbucks, the people at Walmart, people are hip to this.
[00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:42.556]  And we have to thank you, we have to thank Dr. Ron Paul, and the hundreds of thousands of patriots all around this country.
[00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:53.804]  And the real power, the real credit goes not just to the leaders fighting this, but the people that have been person to person with the books, the films, the events.
[00:05:55.245 --> 00:05:55.946]  It is the people.
[00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:56.446]  Exactly.
[00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.148]  And that's the reason the establishment hasn't just killed us.
[00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.270]  20, 30 years ago, they would kill people.
[00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.610]  Absolutely.
[00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.391]  We're talking about this.
[00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:03.151]  They would kill congressmen.
[00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:03.992]  What was the fellow's name?
[00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.914]  Larry McDonald.
[00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:07.755]  He got whacked in 1981.
[00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:11.437]  They would kidnap congressmen and senators' kids and kill them if they spoke out.
[00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:16.921]  But the point is, now that the idea is out there, and that ideas are bulletproof, they're having a...
[00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:18.428]  A big problem.
[00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.691]  Early on they knew they could shut it down if they could just get the few people quiet.
[00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:23.711]  But now it's too late.
[00:06:24.472 --> 00:06:26.873]  The cat's out of the bag.
[00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:29.494]  And so people are getting more aware.
[00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:44.122]  And being aware that money is the way of control and that the Federal Reserve, controlled by whatever you want to call these rascals, whether you want to call them the cabal, the plutocracy, whether you want to call them the Illuminati, the power elite,
[00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:50.385]  These people are in separation consciousness, they're in fear, and they're manipulating and controlling.
[00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:52.746]  They're the pirates, and there's always been pirates.
[00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:54.727]  And we've got to get that through our heads.
[00:06:54.787 --> 00:07:05.113]  The people who control our banking systems and control our government are one and the same, and they are manipulating and milking this economy for everything that they can.
[00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:13.257]  And they are creating, and it's not money, they're not creating, don't use the word money, they're creating debt-based currencies.
[00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:15.398]  Debt obligations.
[00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.319]  Our currency is debt.
[00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:17.679]  Yes.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:25.823]  And it is absolutely the biggest mathematical scam you can get.
[00:07:25.843 --> 00:07:27.483]  And it's like a hockey stick.
[00:07:27.783 --> 00:07:39.108]  If the spread is 2 or 3 percent, at first the difference between the loans and what is owed is very small, but incrementally
[00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:46.013]  And that's one thing that the Illuminati always does, is that they've worked incrementally and patiently.
[00:07:46.193 --> 00:07:51.557]  As time goes on, that debt based upon other debt continues to go up.
[00:07:51.817 --> 00:07:54.799]  And so now it's going up like a hockey stick.
[00:07:55.419 --> 00:08:02.184]  And the actual debt on the debt is getting as big as the equity itself.
[00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:06.967]  And remember, with fractional reserve banking,
[00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.723]  This money can never be paid back.
[00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:17.408]  Let's say we cut back all government spending and all taxes went to paying off the debt.
[00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:22.753]  It is still mathematically impossible to pay off the debt.
[00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.371]  And of course, we're not going to stop spending.
[00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:28.571]  We're not going to stop creating debt.
[00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:35.713]  As I heard Dr. Roberts just speak, and he was an incredible guest, and I really give you a lot of credit for having him on.
[00:08:36.174 --> 00:08:46.916]  He was saying, as we were talking about last week, this year's federal budget debt is 400% greater than the year before.
[00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:51.898]  That is absolute, incredible insanity.
[00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.565]  You can't get out of debt by digging the hole deeper.
[00:08:57.588 --> 00:08:58.248]  You can't do it.
[00:08:58.328 --> 00:09:00.310]  And it's made up debt to the private banks.
[00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.350]  Of course it is.
[00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:07.554]  And all this money is going... Here's a question.
[00:09:07.574 --> 00:09:09.235]  We're approaching an endgame here.
[00:09:10.035 --> 00:09:24.724]  What do you think the time frame, you know, a few months ago, filming Follow the Republic at your house, we were standing around the kitchen drinking tea, talking about time frames, whether it's going to be inflation or whether it's going to be depression, what's going to happen with the currency.
[00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:26.846]  How do you see this unfolding?
[00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.649]  First of all, we have to learn from history.
[00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.953]  In 1989, a very similar situation hit Japan.
[00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:38.620]  They had financing vehicles that were very similar to our derivatives.
[00:09:39.882 --> 00:09:41.184]  They crashed.
[00:09:41.704 --> 00:09:48.750]  And yet the ruling class of Japan would not flush those out of the system because they were protecting the ruling class.
[00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:54.095]  Now, Japan is the most productive nation per capita in the world.
[00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:58.079]  They have this glistening industry, incredibly hard-working, focused people.
[00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:02.602]  So you give us the same recipe, but with our big welfare state and laziness.
[00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:03.884]  We're dead meat.
[00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:04.084]  Yes.
[00:10:04.364 --> 00:10:19.396]  And Japan, in the period of time since 1989, their amount of monies that they have spent from their federal government trying to fix this situation has been approximately equal to what we're doing right now.
[00:10:19.937 --> 00:10:27.063]  And Japan, even though they're one of the world's leading exporters, they're incredibly technologically advanced.
[00:10:27.523 --> 00:10:30.124]  They have had 20 years of recession.
[00:10:30.424 --> 00:10:31.265]  The Nikkei was at $39,000.
[00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:34.406]  It's $9,000 right now.
[00:10:34.726 --> 00:10:36.347]  The real estate boom has gone down.
[00:10:36.607 --> 00:10:37.968]  And I go to Japan all the time.
[00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:39.448]  I'm going to be going there shortly.
[00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:41.409]  And it's an amazing place.
[00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:42.450]  These people work.
[00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.792]  They're educated, and they're focused on creating money.
[00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:50.735]  And they've been going for 20 years, and they're still in the hole.
[00:10:50.855 --> 00:10:58.259]  Because all of the money that they're producing, all their profits, is going to pay the interest on their derivatives.
[00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.120]  It's called the Japan Syndrome.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.203]  And so we are in a very, very similar situation here.
[00:11:04.223 --> 00:11:04.723]  But worse!
[00:11:05.243 --> 00:11:05.884]  But worse!
[00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:06.864]  But worse.
[00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:10.827]  And what is even what I consider to be worse
[00:11:11.727 --> 00:11:17.789]  ...is the quality of the consciousness and the energy of the people in this country.
[00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:28.091]  We used to be that most hard-working, self-sufficient, freedom-loving, honest people in the whole country, in the whole world.
[00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:29.212]  We're making generalizations.
[00:11:29.252 --> 00:11:31.012]  We're not saying everybody's bad.
[00:11:31.032 --> 00:11:34.313]  It's just that you go out there, we're a lot of demonic goblin people.
[00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:36.352]  I mean, they're not really evil people.
[00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:43.797]  And I'm glad you said, you know, sometime, you know, in talking about this stuff, you know, there's, there are so many good people.
[00:11:43.817 --> 00:11:45.218]  We've aborted 51 million babies.
[00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:47.960]  The CPS kidnaps a million kids a year.
[00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:50.082]  If you take a look at the situation.
[00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:50.622]  We've got a break, George.
[00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:54.345]  We're going to come back and go over this, get into the flu, get into the police state.
[00:11:54.885 --> 00:11:54.985]  U.S.
[00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:58.007]  military employs counterinsurgency strategy in California City.

[00:12:58.809 --> 00:13:00.830]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:01.711]  Spy on me?
[00:13:01.831 --> 00:13:02.111]  Yeah.
[00:13:02.151 --> 00:13:07.075]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:08.676]  You should use StartPage instead.
[00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:09.476]  StartPage?
[00:13:09.576 --> 00:13:10.977]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[00:13:11.097 --> 00:13:13.899]  The new name for XQuick, the world's most private search engine.
[00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:17.782]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:13:21.044 --> 00:13:23.406]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:25.148]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:13:25.268 --> 00:13:25.488]  Right!

[00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:29.411]  Hello, folks.
[00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:30.412]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:13:30.812 --> 00:13:34.335]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:13:34.676 --> 00:13:38.299]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:13:58.698 --> 00:14:04.904]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:13.153]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:13.493 --> 00:14:21.341]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:26.403]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:26.743 --> 00:14:31.485]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:35.807]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.328]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:37.388 --> 00:14:41.430]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.273]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:14:46.794 --> 00:14:49.356]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:14:51.577 --> 00:14:51.798]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:58.075 --> 00:14:58.415]  Hello!
[00:14:58.735 --> 00:15:03.138]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:15:03.499 --> 00:15:08.002]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:15:08.322 --> 00:15:13.105]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:17.367]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:15:17.547 --> 00:15:21.469]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:24.130]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.291]  It was empowering.
[00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:29.293]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:15:29.413 --> 00:15:32.194]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:15:32.214 --> 00:15:34.955]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:35.876]  Thank you so much.
[00:15:36.056 --> 00:15:38.837]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:39.477]  Thanks again.
[00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:42.279]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.034]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:49.819]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:54.045]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:04.988]  George Humphries, our guest.
[00:16:05.008 --> 00:16:09.649]  We're going to take your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:09.869]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:14.230]  I'd like to respect our guests and direct questions or comments at George.
[00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.130]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:26.753]  In fact, I'm going to say today, first-time callers, we're going to wipe the phone board right now, or go through the calls and ask if they're first-time callers, because I want to give some new people a chance.
[00:16:26.773 --> 00:16:26.833]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:32.162 --> 00:16:35.624]  Uh, George, you were trying to make a point before we went to break, but I wanted to make this point.
[00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:37.144]  It's a double-edged sword.
[00:16:37.224 --> 00:16:46.489]  Not only for 15 years have I been speaking out, or 14 years on air, you 18 or more, and many others for decades, like Ron Paul 30-plus years.
[00:16:48.146 --> 00:16:49.567]  It takes time to do this.
[00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:57.553]  The globalists love to give us an instant gratification society, where we expect everything instantly, but they understand the power of taking their time.
[00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:03.156]  So that's why we need to counter them with that, knowing that we're not going to see instant results when we do something.
[00:17:03.497 --> 00:17:06.038]  It takes time to go out and bounce around and grow.
[00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.099]  It's like seeds.
[00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.200]  It's like growing a crop.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.480]  Right.
[00:17:09.421 --> 00:17:10.021]  Absolutely.
[00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:15.125]  And the question is, is that every one of us has a choice in front of us.
[00:17:15.245 --> 00:17:16.266]  We all have a choice.
[00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:30.651]  Do we actually believe that freedom and sovereignty and the highest values of the Constitution are something that are positive for our nation, for our community, for our families, and for ourselves?
[00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:33.492]  And most people will go, oh yeah, yeah, of course it is.
[00:17:33.892 --> 00:17:39.755]  But is this something that really is freedom and sovereignty for ourselves?
[00:17:40.615 --> 00:17:42.596]  And in the coming future, important.
[00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:45.796]  Because you and Jaron, the head producer, were talking during the break.
[00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:48.337]  He was saying, all his friends know the wars are for money.
[00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:50.017]  Everybody knows the banks are raping us.
[00:17:50.257 --> 00:17:53.398]  Well, we shouldn't just take this like a crack whore being beaten.
[00:17:53.798 --> 00:17:54.318]  Exactly.
[00:17:54.398 --> 00:17:58.319]  And this is part of the massive, massive mind control.
[00:17:58.399 --> 00:18:01.360]  And this is not just, this is just not words.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.661]  Is that the Illuminati or the power leader, whatever you want to call these rascals,
[00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:08.522]  And that's what all the globalists, when we cover this in Endgame,
[00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:39.824]  They admit they're poisoning us, they're poisoning our food and water to make us more easily controlled.
[00:18:39.964 --> 00:18:41.005]  Oh, it's amazing.
[00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:41.285]  I mean...
[00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:58.119]  In 1942 through 1945, both Uncle Adolf Hitler and Uncle Joseph Stalin were putting fluoride into their concentration camps because fluoride is a thyroid inhibitor.
[00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.061]  And that's in a Pulitzer Prize winning book.
[00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:01.723]  That came out in Nuremberg.
[00:19:01.763 --> 00:19:02.864]  That is not a conspiracy.
[00:19:03.084 --> 00:19:03.424]  Of course.
[00:19:05.236 --> 00:19:05.736]  Fact.
[00:19:06.397 --> 00:19:08.538]  And it's been fact for 50 years.
[00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.716]  Absolutely.
[00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:52.602]  We're good to go!
[00:20:17.122 --> 00:20:26.024]  And for years and years and years, back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, the number one ingredient, the number one ingredient in rat poison was fluoride.
[00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:28.924]  And so... You can still buy it where it says fluoride on the back.
[00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:31.665]  It's decon rat poison.
[00:20:31.885 --> 00:20:46.848]  And so, not only are we interrupting our thyroid, because all the endocrine system, and if you hear the concepts of chakras, the way human beings connect within their own conscious development... The electrical system in the body.
[00:20:47.368 --> 00:20:48.108]  Exactly.
[00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:49.028]  Exactly.
[00:20:49.509 --> 00:20:54.630]  And our pituitary is being messed up with aspartame.
[00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.690]  The chemtrails are coming in.
[00:20:57.751 --> 00:20:58.391]  MSG.
[00:20:59.151 --> 00:20:59.691]  Mercury.
[00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:03.772]  What about the media saying there's no mercury in the flu shot when it's on the insert?
[00:21:03.852 --> 00:21:07.673]  It's Tamarisol, which is even more toxic than mercury is.
[00:21:07.813 --> 00:21:10.076]  I mean, you know, they change the name.
[00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:11.798]  It's a hyper form of mercury.
[00:21:11.978 --> 00:21:13.900]  It's a hyper form of mercury.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:22.009]  And the second most toxic element on the charts after plutonium and uranium is mercury.
[00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:28.194]  What mercury does is it inhibits the ability of the synapse to send messages.
[00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:43.046]  And so when people start getting mercury in their system, which almost every person does now at different degrees, you start having larger percentage of ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder, and... Obesity?
[00:21:43.066 --> 00:21:43.407]  Stay there.
[00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:43.887]  We're coming back.
[00:21:43.947 --> 00:21:44.467]  Long segment.
[00:21:44.487 --> 00:21:45.328]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:21:45.348 --> 00:21:46.509]  George Humphrey is our guest.
[00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:46.969]  Stay with us.
[00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:50.312]  We're on the march.
[00:21:50.793 --> 00:21:52.314]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:56.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.107 --> 00:22:01.709]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:02.129 --> 00:22:07.092]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.193]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:09.493 --> 00:22:14.316]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:15.456]  How much do you want?
[00:22:15.676 --> 00:22:16.437]  When do you want it?
[00:22:16.817 --> 00:22:18.398]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:18.698 --> 00:22:19.519]  When will you need it?
[00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.820]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.081]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:24.622]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:27.204]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:22:27.364 --> 00:22:29.907]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:30.088 --> 00:22:33.311]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:37.176]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:37.496 --> 00:22:38.497]  How much will you need?
[00:22:38.738 --> 00:22:39.338]  We don't know.
[00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:40.560]  How much do you want?
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.461]  All you can get.
[00:22:41.481 --> 00:22:42.482]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:42.742 --> 00:22:42.963]  I think.
[00:22:58.092 --> 00:23:03.259]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.362]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:23:05.482 --> 00:23:07.805]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:07.925 --> 00:23:09.768]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:11.570]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:12.872]  There is a solution.
[00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:21.121]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:24:05.066 --> 00:24:06.286]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:25:09.983 --> 00:25:11.724]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:13.284]  for 3 p.m.
[00:25:13.324 --> 00:25:13.704]  Central.
[00:25:13.744 --> 00:25:14.444]  I'm here live.
[00:25:14.464 --> 00:25:15.325]  George Humphrey's our guest.
[00:25:15.665 --> 00:25:20.566]  By the way, I want to just point out that he has made several documentary films and written a bunch of books.
[00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:25.288]  9-1-1, The Great Illusion by George Humphrey is an easy, quick read.
[00:25:25.668 --> 00:25:29.669]  It's a color booklet full of photographs and diagrams and graphics.
[00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:30.950]  This is one of the best books.
[00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.231]  And we sell these right at cost.
[00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:34.552]  I mean, these are super inexpensive.
[00:25:34.572 --> 00:25:37.274]  I forget what they are, like $5, $4 or something.
[00:25:37.294 --> 00:25:39.716]  We've got his film, 9-1-1, The Great Illusion.
[00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:41.497]  It's excellent.
[00:25:42.118 --> 00:25:46.181]  So, again, it's all available at infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:25:46.201 --> 00:25:48.803]  He's also a big part of our new film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:25:53.406 --> 00:25:54.706]  And here's some posters for you, George.
[00:25:55.027 --> 00:25:56.027]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:25:56.067 --> 00:25:58.748]  And as I told you, I'm going to frame this rascal.
[00:25:58.788 --> 00:26:01.168]  It's beautiful and put it in my office.
[00:26:01.588 --> 00:26:05.049]  And again, I was in the Obama deception and enjoyed that.
[00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:10.191]  In the Obama deception, the quality of the production was incredible.
[00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:15.513]  And the fall of the republic is the professionalism that this is presented in is even better.
[00:26:17.173 --> 00:26:20.714]  Clearly, I'm biased because I'm in the movie, but it's worthwhile.
[00:26:20.754 --> 00:26:25.455]  Well, you do a great job breaking it down, so please visit the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:26:26.095 --> 00:26:30.976]  Before I go any further, I do want to tell you about a couple of sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[00:26:31.436 --> 00:26:32.716]  One of them is Ecolablue.
[00:26:32.737 --> 00:26:36.737]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[00:26:36.777 --> 00:26:39.118]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[00:26:39.638 --> 00:26:43.599]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28 machine, will allow you to do just that.
[00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:47.382]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[00:26:47.702 --> 00:26:51.384]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven-stage filter process.
[00:26:52.483 --> 00:26:59.026]  Including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking.
[00:26:59.066 --> 00:27:00.727]  No chemicals, pollutants or fluoride.
[00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:03.488]  We spend so much time talking about here on the radio broadcast.
[00:27:03.848 --> 00:27:15.614]  Get your very own source of unlimited renewable drinking water for you and your family today by visiting them on their website at colablue.com or by clicking on their banners on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com or give them a call today at 800-691-6043.
[00:27:19.996 --> 00:27:24.837]  And continuing with one other sponsor, eFoodsDirect.com is non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:26.818]  They have fully organic lines as well.
[00:27:27.218 --> 00:27:32.799]  They have different food lines for all different sorts of special diets that people are on.
[00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:35.100]  They have three-day, seven-day packs.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.641]  It's all dehydrated, so it's very easy to carry.
[00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:38.401]  The meals are 50% bigger.
[00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:44.204]  Okay, George, I want to go through a bunch of subjects with you and then take some calls here while we have you today.
[00:28:09.341 --> 00:28:12.423]  On the subject of militarization of police, they're everywhere.
[00:28:12.443 --> 00:28:14.125]  They're giving people tickets for no reason.
[00:28:14.165 --> 00:28:25.533]  They're taking people's kids without due process, the CPS, the taxes, the bureaucracy, the state taxes, the international taxes, California and Oregon passing carbon taxes, the carbon tax.
[00:28:26.073 --> 00:28:30.315]  I have an article here from PrisonPlanet.com that has links to mainstream news, the Washington Post.
[00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:31.036]  U.S.
[00:28:31.056 --> 00:28:34.837]  military employs counterinsurgency strategy in California City.
[00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:43.702]  Former special forces colonel says violence hit town, is a laboratory, as Washington Post advocates nationwide implementation of troops on the streets in America.
[00:28:44.382 --> 00:28:46.743]  This is really happening.
[00:28:46.823 --> 00:28:49.925]  I mean, this is real bona fide tyranny.
[00:28:50.225 --> 00:28:51.406]  Your take on that?
[00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:57.742]  Well, as they say, power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:28:58.423 --> 00:28:59.783]  And this is just a fact of life.
[00:29:02.332 --> 00:29:11.980]  Power elite, those who are in separation consciousness, those who are in fear consciousness, realize that the internet and the consciousness of the people is increasing more and more.
[00:29:12.441 --> 00:29:28.675]  And the people like Alex Jones and myself and Paul Craig Roberts and the hundreds of thousands of other patriots around the country who are working for a better, freer, sovereign nation and world right now are getting the message out and getting the message out very effectively.
[00:29:29.588 --> 00:29:38.414]  These people are freaking out, and the first thing that they think of is getting a bigger stick, trying to knock us down, trying to hit us, trying to control us.
[00:29:39.115 --> 00:29:43.478]  And of course, the police departments are the main place.
[00:29:43.818 --> 00:29:46.540]  Now, most of the cops don't know what's going on.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.784]  Now, when I was a city council member, we still had peace officers.
[00:29:52.728 --> 00:29:58.297]  We had peace officers and we had policemen that were there for the people of Austin.
[00:29:58.718 --> 00:30:07.652]  And as a matter of fact, it wasn't that long ago that police officers and peace officers wore blue and the sheriffs wore brown.
[00:30:09.113 --> 00:30:10.615]  And now they're all in black.
[00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:21.790]  I see that Maryland is just, not Maryland, but Massachusetts, which is supposed to be the home of the most liberal people in the country, now have got all their police officers in all black.
[00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.014]  And they were in the news, a police chief said, this is too intimidating.
[00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:26.755]  And it's like the Praetorian Guard.
[00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:29.156]  And again, history tends to repeat itself.
[00:30:29.216 --> 00:30:34.898]  And just like the Caesar, when it went from a republic to an empire, they created the Praetorian Guard.
[00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:37.439]  And the Praetorian Guard, of course, all wore all black.
[00:30:37.899 --> 00:30:41.780]  And that is a psychological way to create fear.
[00:30:42.261 --> 00:30:44.982]  And all of this is a choice between fear,
[00:30:46.024 --> 00:30:49.506]  And love between separation and coming together.
[00:30:49.966 --> 00:30:57.849]  And this, as I've said a thousand times, this is bigger than just an economic or a political or a cultural war.
[00:30:58.209 --> 00:31:01.631]  This is a time for each and every one of us to make a choice.
[00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:10.835]  It's a time of spiritual choice, whether we're going to live in unity, consciousness and cooperation and be sovereign and free and love ourselves.
[00:31:11.155 --> 00:31:29.698]  First of all, love ourselves and our family and our world and the good things that government can bring, such as the Constitution, or whether we're going to close our eyes and we're going to listen to these rascals and all of their lies and everything that they're saying to us
[00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:35.481]  ABC, CBS, NBC, Time, Newsweek, you know, every place.
[00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:38.862]  It's all propaganda to create fear.
[00:31:39.322 --> 00:31:41.222]  Well, George, there's no longer any doubt.
[00:31:41.303 --> 00:31:44.464]  I mean, there was a checklist of 30 things that are tyranny.
[00:31:44.804 --> 00:31:46.184]  They've double-checked everything.
[00:31:46.924 --> 00:31:54.867]  It's now admitted, and this started decades ago, but that almost all TV is government-paid for, and they're writing the scripts with all these messages of tyranny.
[00:31:55.987 --> 00:32:03.291]  Including NPR, and for all my good liberal friends who still listen to NPR, wake up!
[00:32:03.831 --> 00:32:04.772]  It's the worst.
[00:32:05.032 --> 00:32:11.255]  Just because they say it with kind of a sweet... It's hypnotizing.
[00:32:11.335 --> 00:32:15.878]  It makes me physically ill to listen to those hypocrites.
[00:32:16.418 --> 00:32:17.218]  Physically ill.
[00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:20.160]  And I'll tell you what... Look at Obama expanding all the wars.
[00:32:22.809 --> 00:32:41.379]  Your first movie on this, The Obama Deception, you've got to underword the word deception because this guy, even though he's the most incredibly charismatic person who's been on the scene for the last 50 years, it's all about deception, deception, deception.
[00:32:41.719 --> 00:32:46.441]  Every single one of his promises, as you have pointed out again and again and again.
[00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:51.458]  He's gone 180 degrees apart.
[00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:54.599]  And I still see my friends who are, oh, Obama, Obama.
[00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:57.140]  And so I say, well, do you support the war?
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.201]  And they kind of shake a little bit.
[00:33:00.781 --> 00:33:05.903]  And most of them run off, because they know that there's going to be an intelligent discussion.
[00:33:05.963 --> 00:33:08.124]  Because they're cognitive dissidents.
[00:33:08.184 --> 00:33:10.245]  And remember this term, cognitive dissidents.
[00:33:10.685 --> 00:33:15.487]  And it's something that we all have, is that we invest our time, energy, or money in a concept
[00:33:16.107 --> 00:33:16.467]  Is that
[00:33:39.445 --> 00:33:39.725]  I don't
[00:33:59.509 --> 00:34:04.013]  We are American citizens who believe in the Constitution.
[00:34:04.353 --> 00:34:08.136]  This is not a question of right or wrong, you know, right or left.
[00:34:08.196 --> 00:34:10.377]  It's a question of right or wrong.
[00:34:10.758 --> 00:34:11.838]  Do we want freedom?
[00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:13.019]  Do we want truth?
[00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.981]  Do we want a better America?
[00:34:15.461 --> 00:34:17.443]  Or are we going to be asleep?
[00:34:17.563 --> 00:34:21.305]  Well, the American people have not been taught in the last 30, 40 years what tyranny is.
[00:34:21.866 --> 00:34:24.488]  And so they're told, here's freedom, but it's really tyranny.
[00:34:25.308 --> 00:34:25.869]  And then they tell
[00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:29.720]  The public, those of us that are for freedom, that we're the bad ones.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:46.666]  I mean, I've had Salon, and all six of George Soros' big publications, and the New Republic, and the ADL, and CBS, and the Jerusalem Post, all in the last day come out and say, no longer are they just ignoring me, or making fun of me, or just attacking me.
[00:34:46.686 --> 00:34:49.847]  They're now saying, we gotta shut this guy up, he's dangerous.
[00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:53.148]  And the reason they're now saying this is, they're watching our growth curve.
[00:34:53.328 --> 00:34:55.749]  Yeah, but it's going straight up.
[00:34:55.809 --> 00:34:59.290]  And I say to them, I am trying to be loving.
[00:35:00.251 --> 00:35:01.171]  I know they're wrong.
[00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:02.271]  I know they're abusive.
[00:35:02.772 --> 00:35:04.152]  I know they're hurting my country.
[00:35:04.272 --> 00:35:05.553]  I know they're involved in evil.
[00:35:05.993 --> 00:35:10.034]  And I'm telling them now, and I'm going to look at them right now and tell them, you're in the wrong.
[00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:10.895]  You know you're bad.
[00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:11.735]  You know you're lying.
[00:35:12.175 --> 00:35:13.456]  You know you're using duplicity.
[00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:15.276]  You know the New World Order's real.
[00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:16.077]  I mean, the ADL
[00:35:16.957 --> 00:35:20.099]  And CBS wrote articles saying, I'm this big liar.
[00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:21.720]  I say they're setting up a world government.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.021]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:27.103]  Earlier on the show, I went over a bunch of mainstream... I mean, look at this.
[00:35:27.364 --> 00:35:28.404]  Financial Times of London.
[00:35:28.424 --> 00:35:29.845]  This is one of thousands in the last year.
[00:35:30.465 --> 00:35:31.906]  And now for world government.
[00:35:32.126 --> 00:35:34.528]  And this article says, we've lied to you for your own good.
[00:35:34.788 --> 00:35:35.589]  We're taking over.
[00:35:35.629 --> 00:35:36.549]  It's authoritarian.
[00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:37.270]  These are quotes.
[00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:38.671]  Here's another one.
[00:35:39.552 --> 00:35:45.718]  In here I've got the New York Times, Ban Ki-moon coming out and calling for world government and world taxes.
[00:35:45.738 --> 00:35:47.880]  This is what I'm saying, George.
[00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:50.923]  What is the ADL and CBS doing?
[00:35:51.043 --> 00:35:58.210]  What is Salon doing when they come out and say it's a conspiracy theory, there's no mercury in the shots when the insert says it?
[00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:04.358]  What are they doing when they say there's no world government, when it's simultaneously being announced by mainstream media as a good thing?
[00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:07.422]  It's almost like they want to destroy themselves.
[00:36:07.502 --> 00:36:08.824]  I mean, do they understand?
[00:36:09.245 --> 00:36:13.450]  Or are they so arrogant, and they think it's 20 years ago and people just bought whatever they said?
[00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:15.242]  Well, it's ad homily.
[00:36:15.322 --> 00:36:20.107]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to go after you as a person.
[00:36:20.527 --> 00:36:21.968]  And I know you.
[00:36:22.329 --> 00:36:27.353]  And for people who listen to Alex for the first time, and we've all gone through our Alex initiation.
[00:36:27.934 --> 00:36:31.718]  Alex rants and raves and he shouts and he raises his voice.
[00:36:32.018 --> 00:36:35.641]  And so many people say, I can't stand, he's just too intense.
[00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:38.204]  And I just say, listen to him for a week.
[00:36:39.004 --> 00:36:43.247]  Well, I don't want to talk about me, but... Listen to what I'm saying, because this is important.
[00:36:43.648 --> 00:36:57.358]  And Alex, not only is about 98% of what he's saying, if not 100%, right on accurate, that you won't get on CBS or NBC or whatever, which is information you need to know.
[00:36:57.958 --> 00:37:00.361]  But he also has a heart of gold.
[00:37:00.761 --> 00:37:05.506]  As gruff and as grump as he sounds, he's a great guy.
[00:37:05.846 --> 00:37:15.937]  And what's more important is that for all the time I had my television show, I would invite hundreds of city officials, newscasters, people to come in
[00:37:16.517 --> 00:37:19.600]  And not debate, but just have a discussion about this.
[00:37:19.661 --> 00:37:20.962]  And I know you've done the same thing.
[00:37:21.282 --> 00:37:30.913]  And you would invite the top newscasters of CBS, NBC, of the ADL to come in here and just have a discussion and share back and forth.
[00:37:31.073 --> 00:37:32.094]  But they won't do it!
[00:37:32.374 --> 00:37:34.777]  They won't come and have an honest discussion.
[00:37:34.797 --> 00:37:35.778]  They have to dehumanize you.
[00:37:36.458 --> 00:37:45.147]  And so, instead of, as human beings, talking about our point of view... They want to separate everybody.
[00:37:45.187 --> 00:37:45.648]  Of course.
[00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:56.039]  And it's all about... That's why Chris Matthews and the folks on CNN and MSNBC, they have that talking point that if you say, I don't want socialist healthcare, they go, why are you a racist?
[00:37:56.659 --> 00:37:57.900]  Obviously it's illogical.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.901]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:37:59.301 --> 00:38:01.002]  They are invoking racism.
[00:38:01.422 --> 00:38:02.483]  They are the racists.
[00:38:02.543 --> 00:38:05.305]  They are the people using it as a political weapon.
[00:38:05.665 --> 00:38:09.508]  And I'm sure that you would invite Chris or any of these... We have.
[00:38:09.528 --> 00:38:10.969]  We've called them all.
[00:38:11.129 --> 00:38:12.229]  Just come on down.
[00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:14.871]  Look, we're just gonna... We don't even have to debate.
[00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.172]  You can have your say.
[00:38:16.512 --> 00:38:17.473]  I'll have my say.
[00:38:17.593 --> 00:38:19.074]  No fighting back and forth.
[00:38:19.394 --> 00:38:21.035]  And let the people decide.
[00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:22.056]  But you know what?
[00:38:22.156 --> 00:38:24.838]  You've been doing this for years and years and years.
[00:38:25.438 --> 00:38:28.359]  And they won't do it, because they've got something to hide.
[00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.339]  They've got something to hide!
[00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:37.360]  And so folks who are listening, the people who are listening to this message right now, you are the power.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.721]  If each and every one of you today can go out and talk to one person about this, and plant some seeds.
[00:38:43.741 --> 00:38:45.902]  Well tell them about Gandhi, because he has those quotes.
[00:38:46.202 --> 00:38:50.563]  He went around for 20 years just teaching people they had power, and then suddenly it all imploded.
[00:38:52.123 --> 00:39:03.752]  I go to India almost every year and I study in India and Mahatma Gandhi, I've been to his home, I've read him for years and years and years, and he was a very, very bright man.
[00:39:03.832 --> 00:39:10.557]  He went to Oxford, he got his law degree, he went down to South Africa, he was very wealthy down there, but when he came back to India,
[00:39:11.517 --> 00:39:16.661]  There's about 350 million people living in India and about 300,000 British.
[00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:28.269]  And the British were in complete control of the Indian subcontinent, which at that time also included the nations of Pakistan, Kashmir, and Kashmir and the whole area.
[00:39:28.809 --> 00:39:29.730]  And 300,000 people were the Sahibs.
[00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:46.022]  of the whole nation because they had convinced the intellect, not the intellect, but the minds of the Indian people that they were beneath them and that the English were more powerful.
[00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:55.388]  And Gandhi came back and he realized that this was a fight for the minds and the hearts of the Indian people.
[00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:58.391]  And so he showed through example
[00:39:58.991 --> 00:40:21.636]  Through love, through his dedication, and he would go to village to village, and the most important thing he said is that the seed of God is in the heart of every man, woman, and child, and that he was there to show through example that we could nurture the seed and that we were divine, sovereign beings, whether we were white,
[00:40:22.236 --> 00:40:36.328]  Black, Asian, and when he got the Indian people to understand that they had value, that they had intellect, that they had rights, and his main thing was to get the British out still as friends.
[00:40:36.348 --> 00:40:38.249]  He didn't see them as enemies.
[00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:47.257]  He saw them as opponents, and he realized that they had wrong thinking, and he did this through hard work and through peace.
[00:40:47.937 --> 00:40:49.278]  And, you know what, folks?
[00:40:49.678 --> 00:40:53.460]  We can't beat the Illuminati right now with guns.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.281]  We've got to do it with intellect.
[00:40:55.321 --> 00:40:56.722]  They want to make it a physical fight.
[00:40:56.882 --> 00:40:57.122]  Yes.
[00:40:57.522 --> 00:40:59.123]  Now, at the same time, we should defend ourselves.
[00:40:59.143 --> 00:40:59.563]  Of course.
[00:41:00.144 --> 00:41:01.965]  And Gandhi had something to say about that.
[00:41:02.065 --> 00:41:02.525]  Absolutely.
[00:41:02.585 --> 00:41:04.566]  Gandhi was no coward.
[00:41:04.986 --> 00:41:06.527]  Gandhi was a man.
[00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:08.248]  Well, he let them beat him up all the time.
[00:41:08.288 --> 00:41:09.349]  He was a man's man.
[00:41:09.389 --> 00:41:16.553]  But he would say that it's better for a person to go to war and fight and die for their country
[00:41:17.293 --> 00:41:25.019]  than to be a coward and hide under the banner of non-violent civil disobedience.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.702]  Well, you've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[00:41:28.722 --> 00:41:30.184]  You've got to know when to play your cards.
[00:41:30.604 --> 00:41:35.288]  I mean, at points where there's police and they're just peacefully protesting, let them beat them up in front of people.
[00:41:35.708 --> 00:41:41.393]  Because that then shows people, but at the same time, if they're rounding up people in villages, taking them to FEMA camps,
[00:41:41.653 --> 00:41:42.454]  You've got to defend yourself.
[00:41:42.554 --> 00:41:43.194]  Absolutely.
[00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:51.679]  For example, what was going on in Russia was happening in the Ukraine when Stalin was just decimating the Ukraine.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:57.203]  Gandhi was very clear that it was important for those people to stand up and fight.
[00:41:57.623 --> 00:41:58.864]  He was no coward.
[00:42:01.325 --> 00:42:04.308]  We encourage you not to be cowards.
[00:42:04.368 --> 00:42:08.591]  To see this thing as clearly, crystal clearly as possible.
[00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:13.876]  These people care not one iota about your freedom or your life.
[00:42:14.176 --> 00:42:17.178]  And so you need to protect yourself on all different fronts.
[00:42:17.919 --> 00:42:19.000]  But don't be cowards.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.901]  Get involved.
[00:42:19.921 --> 00:42:20.661]  Speak out.
[00:42:20.701 --> 00:42:23.884]  You're not going to be able to physically fight if you can't even talk to your neighbor about this.
[00:42:24.484 --> 00:42:24.944]  Exactly.
[00:42:24.964 --> 00:42:26.244]  It's in increments, it's in steps.
[00:42:26.304 --> 00:42:34.286]  Yes, and it's through the first awareness, becoming aware of the massive illusion, the massive illusion of the vacuum.
[00:42:34.306 --> 00:42:38.347]  Yeah, don't just believe everything we're saying, just realize you're being conned, there's more to the world.
[00:42:38.627 --> 00:42:48.089]  Yes, and then as you become aware of the delusion and the manipulation on the third dimension, and then you become aware of what we call the second awareness, is that
[00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:56.157]  God, whatever you want to call God, the universal creator, the loving intelligence.
[00:42:56.257 --> 00:42:57.018]  We've got to go to break.
[00:42:57.078 --> 00:42:57.619]  We have to go to break.

[00:44:04.318 --> 00:44:07.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.981]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:44:09.668 --> 00:44:12.329]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:18.590]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:23.751]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:33.913]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:34.033 --> 00:44:36.135]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:37.716]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:37.977 --> 00:44:40.238]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:40.419 --> 00:44:42.280]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.325]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:09.510]  Catherine Austen Fitz is going to be with us in the second segment of the Next Hour, 8 After.
[00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:21.977]  I want to go to calls, but George, you're making a really good point about how you read the New York Times and it's all this well-woven together disinformation, rationales, and it's just a continual narrative of deception.
[00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:27.220]  It's a matrix of fraud, but when you know all the facts, then it's completely clear.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.942]  But the average person, it's all written like it's reasonable.
[00:46:30.922 --> 00:46:31.903]  It's a fantasy land.
[00:46:31.923 --> 00:46:33.664]  It's like people with fantasy football.
[00:46:34.064 --> 00:46:38.708]  I mean, they're acting like they're really running quarterbacks, and on this little power trip, it's the same thing.
[00:46:38.728 --> 00:46:39.929]  They're all in this little box.
[00:46:40.189 --> 00:46:46.233]  Yeah, it's just absolutely amazing, because I have been studying this stuff for a long, long time.
[00:46:46.814 --> 00:46:55.880]  And the other day, I was reading the New York Times, which is the number one publication, and I start reading articles about cap and trade, or the vaccines, or whatever it was.
[00:46:56.681 --> 00:47:08.485]  And I just let myself read it, like, without my own point of view, and I realize how incredibly seductive and believable their point is.
[00:47:08.545 --> 00:47:13.087]  Because they'll mix a little truth in, and have a smattering, yeah.
[00:47:13.247 --> 00:47:18.069]  And they do this so well, and as you say, this is the matrix.
[00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:30.813]  And what we're facing is so similar to the movie The Matrix, the illusion out there is just deeper, deeper, deeper than almost any of us can understand.
[00:47:31.274 --> 00:47:34.935]  And we have to understand that to get through this period of time,
[00:47:36.055 --> 00:47:45.581]  And what the Mayan calendar calls 2012, or what the Rishis in India call the changing from the Kali Yuga to the Dwarpa Yuga.
[00:47:45.861 --> 00:47:47.963]  This has all been prophesied for a long time.
[00:47:47.983 --> 00:47:50.724]  Well, the elite believe there's a big change, but it's not going to be the end of the world.
[00:47:50.764 --> 00:47:56.368]  They believe they're bringing their system in, and they're actually trying to suppress people waking up because they know a big change is coming.
[00:47:56.628 --> 00:47:57.528]  Let's take some calls.
[00:47:57.648 --> 00:47:59.730]  Matthew in Arizona, you're on the air with George Humphrey.
[00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:00.030]  Go ahead.
[00:48:01.021 --> 00:48:15.749]  Hey Alex, you guys are doing great today, but I have something really important to bring up that I never really hear on your show, and it's students at universities and how bad the liberal propaganda has been getting
[00:48:16.796 --> 00:48:20.639]  Well, we do talk about how they don't let people have free speech in a lot of universities.
[00:48:20.679 --> 00:48:21.680]  They bully the students.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.841]  They call it liberal.
[00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:23.361]  It's not.
[00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:25.523]  It's really fascism.
[00:48:26.244 --> 00:48:27.765]  And it's anti-family.
[00:48:27.845 --> 00:48:28.825]  It's anti-male.
[00:48:29.166 --> 00:48:36.571]  They want to destroy the existing order so that everybody is basically destitute, institutionalized, and have to lean on the state.
[00:48:36.631 --> 00:48:36.952]  George?
[00:48:37.432 --> 00:48:41.495]  Well, when I think of liberal, I think of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:48:41.655 --> 00:48:49.339]  I think of somebody with an open mind, who is inquisitive, who is there, who wants to play by the rules, who has an open heart.
[00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:55.623]  To call these son-of-a-guns liberal, and we all have these friends who are liberal Democrats.
[00:48:55.623 --> 00:48:56.724]  Well, see, that's the matrix.
[00:48:56.804 --> 00:49:03.388]  They think they're Thomas Jefferson, the average liberal, when really they're working for a eugenics death cult.
[00:49:03.468 --> 00:49:04.228]  Not the amazing.
[00:49:04.388 --> 00:49:13.654]  And the reality is that about 99% of the liberal Democrats in this country believe that they're doing the right thing.
[00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.695]  They think they're doing the right thing.
[00:49:15.755 --> 00:49:17.396]  They read the New York Times.
[00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:18.597]  They watch CNN.
[00:49:19.037 --> 00:49:21.399]  They've swallowed this lie.
[00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:23.219]  Yes, hi Alex, George.
[00:49:23.379 --> 00:49:26.360]  I'm calling from Canada where the H1N1 massive vaccine campaign is in full throttle right now.
[00:49:44.059 --> 00:49:48.343]  There have been reports of one person dying of complications.
[00:49:48.383 --> 00:49:54.688]  There's a bunch of reports of deaths all over the world, China, France, England, and they're really covering most of them up.
[00:49:55.629 --> 00:50:05.157]  And I just wanted to ask you, George, you know, you seem to see more police presence in Mexico.
[00:50:05.237 --> 00:50:08.200]  The army is everywhere due to the fight against
[00:50:09.022 --> 00:50:10.383]  There's no question about it.
[00:50:10.823 --> 00:50:11.343]  It's already happening.
[00:50:11.363 --> 00:50:12.844]  Yeah, that's what we were just talking about.
[00:50:12.904 --> 00:50:13.584]  We're going to go to break.
[00:50:13.684 --> 00:50:14.425]  Thank you so much, Don.
[00:50:14.585 --> 00:50:15.145]  Anything else?
[00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:42.641]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:45.906]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:48.396 --> 00:50:52.638]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:50:52.938 --> 00:50:53.558]  Number one.
[00:50:53.859 --> 00:50:57.000]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:57.840]  Number two.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.683]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:03.023 --> 00:51:03.483]  It's true.
[00:51:03.783 --> 00:51:08.345]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:08.645 --> 00:51:09.206]  Number three.
[00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:12.747]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:13.067 --> 00:51:16.749]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:16.969 --> 00:51:20.131]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:20.512 --> 00:51:23.914]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:24.194 --> 00:51:28.917]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:29.138 --> 00:51:33.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:52:12.813 --> 00:52:17.094]  We are back live with George Humphrey in the studio with us for the final segment.
[00:52:19.054 --> 00:52:23.456]  Continuing with your phone calls, let's talk to Matt in the... Well, you know what?
[00:52:23.516 --> 00:52:25.376]  Dom was asking about the H1N1 briefly.
[00:52:26.356 --> 00:52:29.997]  H1N1's being used to set up a medical tyranny to set the precedent to give us shots.
[00:52:30.297 --> 00:52:35.218]  They're now announcing, oh, you're gonna have to get a regular flu shot every year and the swine flu.
[00:52:35.338 --> 00:52:36.098]  And boosters.
[00:52:36.499 --> 00:52:37.599]  And, you know, which is just...
[00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:48.621]  Look, even the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Clinic, which is the most establishment organization in this country, is saying they wouldn't take the shots.
[00:52:48.841 --> 00:52:50.423]  And those are moral decisions.
[00:52:50.443 --> 00:52:53.226]  These are establishment people that I guarantee are getting in trouble for this.
[00:52:53.626 --> 00:52:55.768]  Doctors are all over the world saying don't take it.
[00:52:56.289 --> 00:52:57.971]  And they still call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:52:57.991 --> 00:52:58.912]  That isn't going to hold water.
[00:52:59.372 --> 00:53:11.660]  You know, and the amazing thing is if you look back at the quote, swine flu, it is not possible for an avian flu to coexist with a mammal flu.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:18.124]  It just doesn't happen in nature and this is clearly a man-made, genetically
[00:53:18.624 --> 00:53:19.644]  Modified flu.
[00:53:20.085 --> 00:53:38.410]  And now that they're finding strains of the 1918 flu influenza, that they went up a couple years ago, they went up to Spitsberg, which is some islands north of Iceland, they're controlled by Norway, where they bury these people, and got strains of the flu from people who died up there.
[00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:43.492]  And it suddenly, and I remember eight years ago when they did that, it was in the news, we said, look out, they're going to bring it back.
[00:53:43.852 --> 00:53:46.073]  And then now this dead flu is resurrected.
[00:53:46.613 --> 00:53:48.835]  You know, and I think it's going to be really interesting.
[00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:55.199]  I don't know what's happening in the Ukraine today, but about five or six days ago, they got a very virulent flu in the Ukraine.
[00:53:55.219 --> 00:54:01.164]  Well, their government is even admitting that they believe that all the different flu vaccines have mutated to form this.
[00:54:01.324 --> 00:54:03.926]  Yeah, and so we've got to keep our eye on it.
[00:54:04.146 --> 00:54:08.970]  But the most important thing is don't trust the vaccines.
[00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.890]  They don't help.
[00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:10.831]  They'll make you sick.
[00:54:11.111 --> 00:54:16.135]  There's people here, right here in Austin, Texas, who've taken it and who have become paralyzed.
[00:54:16.195 --> 00:54:17.356]  I know a whole bunch of people.
[00:54:17.396 --> 00:54:18.356]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:18.736 --> 00:54:23.599]  And so, the best way to protect yourself is to be healthy.
[00:54:23.919 --> 00:54:27.881]  To eat good, clean, organic, raw food.
[00:54:27.921 --> 00:54:28.661]  And a lot of sunshine.
[00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:29.922]  A lot of sunshine.
[00:54:29.982 --> 00:54:36.625]  Get that vitamin D and eat good, clean, organic fruits and vegetables.
[00:54:36.645 --> 00:54:38.206]  Let's take one more or two more calls.
[00:54:38.286 --> 00:54:39.667]  Matt in the UK, you're on the air.
[00:54:39.687 --> 00:54:40.047]  Go ahead.
[00:54:41.826 --> 00:54:43.768]  Hi Alex and hi George, good afternoon.
[00:54:43.828 --> 00:54:48.512]  And by the way Alex, you are growing very rapidly in the UK by the way, so put your head up high, mate.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.762]  I mean, here's the problem.
[00:54:51.802 --> 00:55:00.987]  I have you make your point, but on the whole ADL subject, I want to get bigger to reach more people, but I'm almost like steaming towards my destruction, but I morally have to do it.
[00:55:01.308 --> 00:55:03.009]  It's not like, ooh, I'm getting big.
[00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:05.130]  I'm a celebrity now around the world.
[00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:07.031]  I mean, bigger and bigger.
[00:55:07.812 --> 00:55:11.294]  Media now, when they talk about conspiracies, just uses my name, Alex Jones.
[00:55:11.314 --> 00:55:12.054]  It's like a meme.
[00:55:13.415 --> 00:55:14.036]  I want to be honest.
[00:55:14.056 --> 00:55:15.637]  I don't like it, but thank you.
[00:55:15.657 --> 00:55:15.977]  Go ahead.
[00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.251]  Yeah, thank you Alex.
[00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:20.153]  Yeah, I have a banking question.
[00:55:20.213 --> 00:55:22.216]  Basically you mentioned about the US banking system.
[00:55:22.616 --> 00:55:25.079]  I'm going to tell you about the UK banking system at the moment.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.866]  There's millions and millions of people trying to get back their bank charges and basically the banks aren't even budging.
[00:55:32.167 --> 00:55:35.571]  Shops are closing every day in the UK but the government keeps saying that growth is here.
[00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:36.973]  What do you guys reckon to that one?
[00:55:41.618 --> 00:55:48.042]  George, what's your take on the economy deteriorating, people losing their jobs, but the media is saying we've got a great economy?
[00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:55.007]  Well, it's very clear that in the last five years, consumer spending has represented 67-71% of the whole gross domestic national product.
[00:55:58.889 --> 00:55:59.149]  No.
[00:56:17.455 --> 00:56:18.096]  Unemployment.
[00:56:18.136 --> 00:56:21.579]  Those are the real numbers and the people who are not fully employed.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.582]  The amount of debt is not getting better.
[00:56:24.703 --> 00:56:26.725]  It's getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:56:27.165 --> 00:56:33.351]  We have a huge number of commercial banking mortgage bundles that will be coming up.
[00:56:33.672 --> 00:56:39.378]  The second round of residential bundles are coming up, which is what set this thing off
[00:56:39.978 --> 00:56:41.319]  George, we're out of time.
[00:56:41.339 --> 00:56:43.501]  We got Katherine Austin Fitz on the line coming up.
[00:56:43.621 --> 00:56:44.561]  First time she's going to be on this.
[00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.622]  Very excited about that.
[00:56:45.982 --> 00:56:47.484]  And I'm sorry to Matt and others.
[00:56:47.964 --> 00:56:49.685]  Holding, only got about 30 seconds on air.
[00:56:49.705 --> 00:56:50.466]  We just ran out of time.
[00:56:50.486 --> 00:56:51.647]  But thank you so much, Matt.
[00:56:51.687 --> 00:56:52.367]  Keep spreading the word.
[00:56:52.427 --> 00:56:53.168]  God bless you.
[00:56:53.608 --> 00:56:58.531]  Just kind of freaking me out, though, to realize that this message is getting out like this.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:04.582]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:05.623]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:05.923 --> 00:58:11.705]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.

[00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:30.671]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:58:30.931 --> 00:58:32.753]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:58:32.993 --> 00:58:34.414]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:58:34.755 --> 00:58:37.017]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:58:37.277 --> 00:58:41.661]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:58:42.021 --> 00:58:45.404]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:58:45.725 --> 00:58:48.347]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:58:48.848 --> 00:58:50.289]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:58:50.749 --> 00:58:52.871]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:02.764]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:03.104 --> 00:59:06.125]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:06.365 --> 00:59:11.147]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:11.167 --> 00:59:17.430]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:19.791]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:20.311 --> 00:59:20.612]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:20.632 --> 00:59:21.052]  Bernanke?
[00:59:21.132 --> 00:59:21.913]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:21.953 --> 00:59:23.075]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:23.095 --> 00:59:25.338]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:39.235 --> 00:59:41.075]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:41.356 --> 00:59:46.197]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:46.497 --> 00:59:56.419]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:04.021]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:06.622]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:14.133 --> 01:00:15.934]  Okay, I've got a correction to make.
[01:00:16.715 --> 01:00:24.840]  I've been announcing this is the first time that Kathleen Austin Fitz has been on, but she reminded me that about eight years ago or so, she was on the show.
[01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:32.786]  But for all intents and purposes, it's not her first rodeo, but this is a maiden voyage in the last eight years.
[01:00:33.306 --> 01:00:36.430]  So it is good, good to have her with us.
[01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:40.154]  But I guess if your memory's wiped and you don't remember something, it is a maiden voyage.
[01:00:41.155 --> 01:00:52.047]  Catherine Austin Fitz, founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC, president of the Hamilton Securities Group Investment Bank and financial software developer, assistant secretary of housing.
[01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:56.143]  Federal Housing Commissioner under Bush 1, Managing Director.
[01:00:56.503 --> 01:01:00.466]  Managing Director and member of the board of the Wall Street firm, Dillon Reed & Co, Inc.
[01:01:01.347 --> 01:01:02.508]  Doesn't get any more elite than that.
[01:01:02.588 --> 01:01:11.374]  Catherine has designed and closed over $25 billion in transactions and investments to date, and has led portfolio strategy for $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[01:01:11.714 --> 01:01:13.435]  Solari.com is the website.
[01:01:13.655 --> 01:01:15.837]  S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[01:01:15.857 --> 01:01:21.301]  We're very honored to have her here, and hopefully we can start having her every few months instead of every decade or so.
[01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:26.684]  And I want her to just tell you a little bit about herself, her journey, her voyage, for the few of you that don't know who she is.
[01:01:27.485 --> 01:01:29.326]  She's on TV, radio, a lot over the years.
[01:01:29.846 --> 01:01:35.810]  And then I want to get into what we're facing as a society, what the elites are doing, her take on Obama.
[01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:39.413]  And it's great to have Catherine Austin Fitz on with us today.
[01:01:39.453 --> 01:01:39.793]  Catherine?
[01:01:40.473 --> 01:01:41.774]  Alex, it's always a pleasure.
[01:01:41.814 --> 01:01:44.376]  As you know, I'm a huge fan of you and InfoWars.
[01:01:45.523 --> 01:01:55.770]  Well, I guess I'd forgotten that fact, but I've been emailing you for a while, but maybe emailing the wrong email trying to get you on, and I was crestfallen, but I'm a big fan of you.
[01:01:56.311 --> 01:01:57.131]  You got before.
[01:01:57.191 --> 01:01:59.913]  Break down what you think is most important, but first tell us about yourself.
[01:02:00.033 --> 01:02:05.918]  Well, I came out of the Bush administration thinking, oh my word, the fascists are going to kill us all, we need to do something.
[01:02:06.478 --> 01:02:11.702]  And I started an investment bank in Washington, and our goal was to help communities.
[01:02:12.392 --> 01:02:27.201]  Finance with equity, because rather than shipping all of our money to Wall Street and then hoping a little bit trickles back, or shipping it all to Washington and hoping a little trickles back, my theory was, how about if we financed our own businesses and did much more locally?
[01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:29.522]  So, I started an investment bank.
[01:02:29.602 --> 01:02:35.666]  One of the things we did was we were hired on competitive bid to be financial advisor to the U.S.
[01:02:35.746 --> 01:02:39.288]  Department of Housing and Urban Development, where I'd worked as an assistant secretary.
[01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:47.043]  We did loan sales, Alex, and they were unbelievably successful.
[01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.603]  It was during the Clinton administration.
[01:02:50.464 --> 01:02:52.085]  But the corruption got worse and worse.
[01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:54.546]  Now, you know, it was terrible in the Bush administration.
[01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:56.486]  It just kept getting worse in the Clinton administration.
[01:02:57.207 --> 01:03:03.409]  And we were, a decision was made, I was part of a group of people who were saying, oh my goodness,
[01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:13.147]  With GATT and NAFTA, we're going to ship all the jobs abroad, and we need to do something or else the American people are going to be left high and dry.
[01:03:13.827 --> 01:03:15.128]  The middle class will be wiped out.
[01:03:15.148 --> 01:03:18.008]  How are we going to develop new skills?
[01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:22.790]  How are we going to help people create new jobs and support small business?
[01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:25.611]  We're part of a group that we're working on all of that.
[01:03:26.289 --> 01:03:39.334]  And literally a decision was made rather than address the real problems and help the American people jump the curve on the situation, that instead we would bubble the economy and pull massive amounts of capital and reinvest them abroad.
[01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:45.135]  So this was a conscious decision and you were there on the inside witnessing this?
[01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:45.695]  Absolutely.
[01:03:45.935 --> 01:04:01.947]  And I'll tell you the greatest, one of the best videos I've ever seen, you can get it up on my blog at solari.com slash blog, is Sir James Goldsmith did a speaking tour trying to stop the GATT from being passed and the World Trade Organization to be adopted.
[01:04:02.725 --> 01:04:06.349]  And basically said this is the most frightening, terrifying thing we're going to have.
[01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:09.132]  3 billion people moved off the land.
[01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.774]  Massive unemployment worldwide.
[01:04:12.235 --> 01:04:16.399]  We're going to destroy, we're going to have massive structural unemployment in the United States.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:25.488]  He gave this interview, it's up on YouTube, to Charlie Rose in 1995 and he predicts everything that's happening now.
[01:04:26.215 --> 01:04:34.099]  Now, remember, this man's a billionaire, very successful businessman, and basically said, look, this is the establishment against everybody else.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.022]  And he said, this is going to be the most devastating, horrible thing that has ever happened to the world.
[01:04:39.082 --> 01:04:40.403]  It's absolutely crazy.
[01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:42.304]  And he lays it all out.
[01:04:43.465 --> 01:04:45.486]  And so I can say the same thing.
[01:04:45.826 --> 01:04:47.027]  We were on the inside.
[01:04:47.547 --> 01:04:49.148]  We're working with the administration.
[01:04:49.913 --> 01:04:53.234]  And we knew that we were going to create massive unemployment.
[01:04:53.274 --> 01:04:58.036]  Now, here's the big secret of the work that I did when I was in Washington during that period.
[01:04:58.957 --> 01:05:09.040]  We created something, Alex, called Community Wizard, which was a software tool that would allow us to look at the sources and uses of government money by place, because America's just 3,100 counties.
[01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:14.843]  And when you look at government investment by place, what you discover is that
[01:05:16.092 --> 01:05:31.417]  That a great deal of money is being spent to centralize economic and political power and to basically subsidize large corporations and all sorts of unproductive behavior, whether it's people on welfare all the way up to corporations on welfare.
[01:05:32.378 --> 01:05:33.878]  But let me give you a couple examples.
[01:05:34.018 --> 01:05:42.581]  We would regularly find places where HUD was spending, this is HUD, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was spending $250,000
[01:05:44.952 --> 01:05:52.694]  To construct or rehab an apartment building when $50,000 would buy and rehab a foreclosed single-family property.
[01:05:53.674 --> 01:05:58.455]  So we were spending four or five times what we needed to to get one.
[01:05:59.095 --> 01:06:06.697]  And I went to the assistant, to the person who ran that program in 1996, and said, look, you know, we could get five homes for the price of one.
[01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:10.858]  And they looked at me, turned bright red, and said, but how would we generate fees for our rent?
[01:06:13.433 --> 01:06:23.916]  Now imagine, if you will, imagine how many more people would have homes today if we weren't doing things like that.
[01:06:24.496 --> 01:06:38.481]  It was just a giant honeypot and the media loves to always blame poor people who were told, oh it's the new America, it's the way to build wealth, build equity, go out from the banks down to the assessors.
[01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:42.782]  We're all going to basically cheat on the forms, the media advertised it was okay to do.
[01:06:43.382 --> 01:06:46.125]  And then the media now tries to blame the poor people.
[01:06:46.165 --> 01:06:52.031]  They got set up and ripped off and given these arms and these balloon mortgages.
[01:06:52.311 --> 01:07:03.764]  That's like, my analogy, Catherine Austin Fitz, is like blaming a six-year-old that doesn't mind their parents, gets out of the backyard, goes in the front yard, and a man has a puppy and candy.
[01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:08.287]  In a van and they get in the car and get taken away and raped and killed.
[01:07:08.587 --> 01:07:10.208]  You don't blame the five-year-old.
[01:07:10.428 --> 01:07:11.649]  You blame the banks.
[01:07:11.709 --> 01:07:12.810]  You blame the killer.
[01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.271]  You blame the people that set this in motion.
[01:07:15.372 --> 01:07:18.634]  Well, in fact, it's called, under the law, it's called fraudulent inducement.
[01:07:19.394 --> 01:07:30.502]  If I encourage you to, if I'm a lender and I encourage you to take on a loan, and I know something about your future financial condition that you don't,
[01:07:31.437 --> 01:07:36.999]  Then that is fraudulent inducement, and you may not be obligated to pay me back for all or a portion.
[01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:48.883]  So, in fact, what happened was, if you look at the big, you know, the largest banks and the largest people leading the mortgage business, everything that I knew then, they knew.
[01:07:48.903 --> 01:07:55.545]  I mean, this was all known in Washington, that the jobs were going to go abroad, and incomes were generally going to fall.
[01:07:56.181 --> 01:08:05.248]  And so what they were doing was they were encouraging people to take out loans, many of whom thought they could pay back and didn't know that their income was going to be falling.
[01:08:05.489 --> 01:08:07.270]  Let's jump forward, then we'll go back.
[01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:08.551]  But let's jump forward.
[01:08:08.871 --> 01:08:25.265]  Greg Gordon's four-part series now on McClatchy Newspapers, he got the internal documents of what you've already publicly stated and others have stated that the pilots that pilot the private fellow reserve and all the major regulatory positions, Goldman Sachs,
[01:08:25.985 --> 01:08:38.632]  We're telling everybody to invest in housing, selling these securities, while at the same time betting against them to destroy their competitors and vertically integrate the market.
[01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:44.695]  To them, making everybody destitute or a lower standard of living, that's great vertical integration.
[01:08:44.915 --> 01:08:52.619]  That's like a mosquito jamming their proboscis into your arm, pumping in enzymes to liquidate the cells so they can slurp them up.
[01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:53.980]  I mean, this is just a parasite.
[01:08:55.094 --> 01:08:58.215]  These firms no longer see themselves as serving clients.
[01:08:58.815 --> 01:09:04.237]  They see themselves as trading for their own account and being part of syndicates, which includes the U.S.
[01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:06.538]  government, which engage in economic warfare.
[01:09:07.658 --> 01:09:13.440]  And when they engage in economic warfare and when they trade for their own account, they're using the federal credit to do it.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.042]  And so, you know, if they lose money, we print paper and dig them out.
[01:09:19.962 --> 01:09:22.163]  And if they don't lose money, they get to keep it.
[01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.584]  It's sort of win-you-win and lose-you-win.
[01:09:25.382 --> 01:09:26.443]  So what's the endgame?
[01:09:26.463 --> 01:09:41.534]  And then I want to go back over the history of this and more of where we're going and I want you to lead the discussion throughout the rest of the hour, Catherine Austin Fitts, but I mean specifically that you're agreeing that it's premeditated and predatory.
[01:09:41.874 --> 01:09:42.795]  What's the endgame?
[01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:50.826]  And the latest phase started in 1995 with the institution of the World Trade Organization.
[01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:57.713]  What we're watching is a fundamental re-engineering of how resources on planet Earth are governed.
[01:09:58.434 --> 01:10:05.742]  So we're moving from a model where places are governed by governments, by sovereign governments,
[01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:21.162]  To a world where resources are managed by multinational corporations under the auspices of a world government that operates very much through the financial system and the central banking system.
[01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:27.004]  And if you look at the economic model that it's using, it's not really a new model.
[01:10:27.064 --> 01:10:28.745]  It's called central banking warfare.
[01:10:29.557 --> 01:10:34.523]  So the central banks print money, and the military makes sure that people take it.
[01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:48.381]  What's important to understand now, which is not common in any analysis of the economy, is that the United States and its allies have created a global taxation system.
[01:10:49.429 --> 01:11:01.840]  And the way it works, Alex, is we print paper, whether it's dollar bills or treasuries, and then other governments around the world, or central banks around the world, buy that paper, and the paper goes down in value.
[01:11:02.621 --> 01:11:06.965]  So it's a taxation system through the balance sheet, no legislature.
[01:11:06.985 --> 01:11:13.691]  You know, every country in the world hasn't passed a law saying, OK, we're going to pay a 5% tithe to the United States Empire every year.
[01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:15.913]  But in fact, that's what's happening through the currency system.
[01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:19.934]  And now by the devaluation, the tax is increasing.
[01:11:20.635 --> 01:11:20.855]  Right.
[01:11:21.275 --> 01:11:38.034]  The tax is increasing and what we're watching just in the last two weeks with various people around the world squawking is they're squawking because the subsidy that needs to be extracted every year is greater and greater and the pain of the taxation as the economy slows down is greater and greater.
[01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:39.448]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.011]  Continue breaking down this global government architecture.
[01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:45.636]  When you were talking about this 10 years ago, the media would still poo-poo it.
[01:11:45.696 --> 01:11:53.826]  Now they're admitting world government is here, but simultaneously if you then say, oh I don't want to be part of it, they say this person's insane, it doesn't exist.
[01:11:54.787 --> 01:11:55.928]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:11:56.068 --> 01:11:56.609]  Amazing.
[01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:57.731]  Katherine Austen Fitz.
[01:11:58.709 --> 01:12:04.714]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity with a free kit.
[01:12:05.115 --> 01:12:05.835]  First the facts.
[01:12:06.276 --> 01:12:08.277]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.
[01:12:09.238 --> 01:12:14.182]  700 billion for TARP, 122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[01:12:14.522 --> 01:12:15.063]  The result?
[01:12:15.363 --> 01:12:21.128]  A deficit of over 1.8 trillion dollars and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above 20%.
[01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:24.811]  Now, the good news.
[01:12:25.191 --> 01:12:34.134]  Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter, created a free inflation survival kit.
[01:12:34.494 --> 01:12:40.396]  The kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much as $431,000 in 12 to 18 months.
[01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.757]  If you're thinking about gold, get this free kit now by calling 888-314-8782.

[01:12:59.724 --> 01:13:03.386]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:06.748]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:06.988 --> 01:13:08.389]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:11.781]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:11.801 --> 01:13:18.006]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.166 --> 01:13:23.190]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:26.512]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:13:26.632 --> 01:13:33.417]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:35.599]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:35.819 --> 01:13:37.160]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:38.281]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:13:38.641 --> 01:13:39.681]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:41.682]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:41.702 --> 01:13:46.784]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:16:25.058 --> 01:16:29.059]  Incredible videos, articles, information, investing advice.
[01:16:29.079 --> 01:16:30.939]  We'll get some of that from her coming up before she leaves us.
[01:16:31.299 --> 01:16:34.180]  Solari, S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.741]  Links up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.161]  Of course, we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:16:41.361 --> 01:16:43.202]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:44.082]  Catherine,
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:51.463]  I'm going to try to just sit back and let you roll now because I want to hear what you think is most important and where all this is going and how we protect ourselves.
[01:16:51.503 --> 01:17:07.870]  But just to realize that open world government is being established, a financial predatory dictatorship that wants us poor and easily controlled, openly being stated, a fake green tyranny, all of this is being set up and we're not even having a national debate about it.
[01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:12.052]  They're just announcing with one hand, world government is here and it's good.
[01:17:13.676 --> 01:17:18.200]  And then, with the other hand, saying, if you talk about it, you're a dangerous kook, it doesn't exist.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.482]  Can you talk about that?
[01:17:21.143 --> 01:17:25.908]  Well, you know, I don't know anybody that says you're a kook if you talk about that.
[01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:28.311]  I mean, I never get called a kook.
[01:17:28.771 --> 01:17:34.677]  No, no, I know you don't get called a kook by the public, because Ban Ki-moon's and the New York Times calling for global governance.
[01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:37.360]  Well, here's an example since you said it.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:45.082]  I had CBS News, Jerusalem Post, ADL, Salon, yesterday, all attack me and say I'm insane.
[01:17:45.122 --> 01:17:45.822]  None of it exists.
[01:17:46.363 --> 01:17:54.305]  Well, you know, Planet Earth divides up into what I call the pro-centralization team and the pro-decentralization team.
[01:17:54.345 --> 01:17:58.727]  And if you look at how the money works, Alex, the economy has been steadily
[01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:03.471]  Centralizing more and more money, and so more and more people are on the dole.
[01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:06.313]  They're on the payroll of the pro-centralization team.
[01:18:06.993 --> 01:18:13.438]  So, you know, when somebody is making money on something, it taxed me for, you know, in whatever way.
[01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:17.021]  I mean, in Washington, we used to just call them the attack poodles.
[01:18:19.002 --> 01:18:22.565]  So when the attack poodles you tell you you're crazy, that's what they're paid to do.
[01:18:22.605 --> 01:18:23.385]  You know, it's a game.
[01:18:23.445 --> 01:18:24.026]  It's not real.
[01:18:25.074 --> 01:18:26.475]  And they know they're lying!
[01:18:26.955 --> 01:18:27.415]  Yeah, they know.
[01:18:28.315 --> 01:18:35.178]  One of the things that's so amazing to me is you see more and more people just, you know, they can't keep a straight face even when they're saying it.
[01:18:35.198 --> 01:18:40.140]  I was watching the clip this morning of the Attorney General announcing the Financial Fraud Task Force.
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.040]  I mean, talk about projection!
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:49.823]  So, you know, and he literally, it looked to me like he couldn't keep a straight face.
[01:18:50.624 --> 01:18:53.585]  So, you know, these guys know it, but you know it's a game.
[01:18:54.875 --> 01:19:03.421]  And the rest of us are on the pro-decentralization team, and part of the challenge is we have not yet created a vision of where the alternative is.
[01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:08.565]  And let me talk about one of the places that we're stuck, because this is so, so important.
[01:19:09.586 --> 01:19:13.728]  Have I ever... You probably don't know my very famous red-button story.
[01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:22.715]  I was giving a speech to a group of people called Spiritual Frontiers Foundation International, and they have a conference once a year, Alex.
[01:19:23.382 --> 01:19:28.263]  Where they go and sit in the woods for a couple days and talk about how they can help our society evolve spiritually.
[01:19:28.783 --> 01:19:39.225]  So, a friend of mine had asked me to give them a speech called, How the Money Works in Organized Crime, and it later became a very famous article called, Narco Dollars for Beginners, and it's designed to... Yes, I've read it.
[01:19:39.585 --> 01:19:39.805]  Right.
[01:19:39.865 --> 01:19:45.906]  It's designed to explain the intersection of narcotics trafficking and organized crime in government and big corporations.
[01:19:45.966 --> 01:19:49.467]  Anyway, so, Wall Street in Washington does drug money.
[01:19:50.177 --> 01:19:53.758]  So I'm in the middle of the speech and I'm explaining the facts.
[01:19:54.959 --> 01:20:03.781]  We're talking about the Dark Alliance allegations and the two hearings that Congress had on CIA drug dealing in South Central L.A.
[01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:10.423]  And I mentioned at the time a reporter that I was helping was told by the Department of Justice that the U.S.
[01:20:10.463 --> 01:20:18.246]  economy launders $500 billion to a trillion dollars a year, $500 billion to a trillion of all dirty money, so that's narcotics trafficking.
[01:20:19.226 --> 01:20:19.867]  I don't know.
[01:20:27.972 --> 01:20:30.534]  Spiritually evolved, committed people.
[01:20:31.055 --> 01:20:34.437]  What would happen if we stopped being the global leader in money laundering?
[01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:47.967]  And they said, well, you know, the money would go to other stock exchanges, so the New York Stock Exchange would go down, and our mutual funds would go down, and we'd have trouble rolling over the government deficit, so we'd have, you know, our taxes might go up and our government checks might stop.
[01:20:48.007 --> 01:20:51.009]  And I said, okay, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the lectern.
[01:20:51.849 --> 01:21:03.994]  And if you push that button, you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking in your county, your state, your country tomorrow, thus offending the people who control 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year.
[01:21:04.434 --> 01:21:05.674]  Who here will push the button?
[01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.195]  And this was the summer of 2000.
[01:21:07.535 --> 01:21:13.157]  Out of 100 people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, guess how many would push the button?
[01:21:14.597 --> 01:21:14.958]  How many?
[01:21:15.798 --> 01:21:15.878]  One.
[01:21:17.009 --> 01:21:19.090]  One would push the button, the other 99 would not.
[01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:20.730]  I said, why would you not push the button?
[01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:25.032]  They said, we don't want our government checks to stop and we don't want our mutual funds to go down.
[01:21:25.132 --> 01:21:26.132]  And that's the trap.
[01:21:26.232 --> 01:21:28.933]  That's how evil gets you dependent on them.
[01:21:28.953 --> 01:21:32.895]  And the police all know the government brings in most of the drugs, but they just...
[01:21:33.715 --> 01:21:37.617]  They have to keep buying the delusion of busting kids and putting them in prison.
[01:21:37.937 --> 01:21:45.141]  If you decriminalize the drugs, the money would dry up, the crime would leave it, and the OD'ing would stop, and the drug abuse would plunge.
[01:21:45.221 --> 01:21:46.241]  All the studies prove it.
[01:21:46.481 --> 01:21:47.062]  Stay with us.
[01:21:48.663 --> 01:21:49.563]  We're on the march.
[01:21:50.063 --> 01:21:51.664]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:55.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:57.881 --> 01:22:07.009]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:22:07.029 --> 01:22:10.172]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:22:10.412 --> 01:22:16.117]  Instead, use vitamin C-D in OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:22:16.278 --> 01:22:20.782]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:23.404]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:22:23.684 --> 01:22:32.755]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:38.281]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:40.283]  Help others and earn extra income.

[01:22:58.544 --> 01:23:01.146]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:01.566 --> 01:23:06.529]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:08.631]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:13.754]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:13.934 --> 01:23:14.895]  How much do you want?
[01:23:15.135 --> 01:23:15.875]  When do you want it?
[01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:17.837]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:18.137 --> 01:23:18.958]  When will you need it?
[01:23:19.218 --> 01:23:21.279]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:21.419 --> 01:23:22.520]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.061]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:29.345]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:29.525 --> 01:23:32.728]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:23:33.128 --> 01:23:36.611]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:23:36.932 --> 01:23:37.933]  How much will you need?
[01:23:38.173 --> 01:23:38.773]  We don't know.
[01:23:39.073 --> 01:23:39.974]  How much do you want?
[01:23:40.174 --> 01:23:40.895]  All you can get.
[01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:41.916]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.196 --> 01:23:44.958]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:23:45.239 --> 01:23:47.441]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.441]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:23:57.569 --> 01:24:04.434]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:04.575 --> 01:24:06.516]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:24:06.656 --> 01:24:08.778]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:24:08.898 --> 01:24:10.399]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:24:10.539 --> 01:24:14.863]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:47.298]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:25:07.799 --> 01:25:09.400]  Solari.com's the website.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.441]  Her name is Catherine Austin Fitz.
[01:25:12.342 --> 01:25:19.626]  She was one of the top people at HUD, managing director and member of the board of Wall Street firm Dillon Reed & Co.
[01:25:20.666 --> 01:25:29.332]  She's designed and closed over 25 billion of transactions and investments to date and has led portfolio strategy for 300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[01:25:29.852 --> 01:25:31.753]  And we're just really honored to have her with us.
[01:25:34.174 --> 01:25:36.736]  Okay, Catherine, we ran into that break and you were
[01:25:37.864 --> 01:25:45.489]  Breaking down the centralization team versus the decentralization team, or team tyranny versus team liberty.
[01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:47.751]  There's so many facets in this.
[01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:51.393]  How far along is this new form of world government?
[01:25:51.974 --> 01:25:55.616]  Describe some of that world government to us, and then get into whatever subjects you want to cover.
[01:25:55.676 --> 01:26:01.000]  Solutions, how you think people can individually protect themselves, strategies for states and counties.
[01:26:02.168 --> 01:26:10.914]  Okay, well let me jump back for a second to the history of what I call the black budget, because you really need to understand the history of this.
[01:26:10.974 --> 01:26:13.836]  People don't understand how it could have gotten so bad and may not notice.
[01:26:15.057 --> 01:26:28.267]  What happened, Alex, was in 1947 and 1949, we passed the National Security Act and the CIA Act, and those two acts in combination allowed money to be clawed out of the federal government
[01:26:28.772 --> 01:26:28.872]  Yes.
[01:26:49.847 --> 01:26:53.190]  You interview or you research and you read the people sort of dealing with it.
[01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:59.615]  It all comes back to a point after World War II where literally the government lost control of the technology.
[01:27:00.255 --> 01:27:14.627]  We had the most powerful, secretive black technology in the world, including some that we brought over from the Nazis, and literally we've created this funding mechanism that paid corporations to control and manage technology.
[01:27:15.699 --> 01:27:31.344]  And a lot of what we're dealing with goes back to the fact that we've had, since then, 50 to 60 years of incredible, non-transparent governmental flows going into, basically, corporate-controlled technology that many of us don't understand.
[01:27:32.556 --> 01:27:52.149]  And when you say, well, how can the military force countries all around the world to take paper that keeps going down in value, it all comes back, as you probably note, a lot of the invisible weaponry, the satellite systems, and all this incredible technology that we don't understand and know about.
[01:27:54.033 --> 01:28:01.538]  I mean they bragged that they're really 30 years advanced and they've got satellites where they can radiate somebody from space.
[01:28:01.878 --> 01:28:03.138]  I mean we have a...
[01:28:04.716 --> 01:28:17.305]  Highly advanced technocracy that has walled itself off in military reservations, private corporate reservations, as you know, is heading up a big company that developed a lot of financial software systems.
[01:28:17.746 --> 01:28:23.850]  And they've rolled out the internet systems, the banking systems, the cashless systems that have now just been adopted.
[01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:31.636]  It's like poisoning the well, poisoning the water hole, and the deer come to it and drink and then go off and die and don't even know what killed them.
[01:28:32.376 --> 01:28:37.159]  It's just like all the technology to track and control us is built into the iPhone or the cell phone.
[01:28:37.439 --> 01:28:45.703]  We just accept it, and we're now basically like savages in this 21st century Buck Rogers system, not even knowing what we're part of.
[01:28:45.763 --> 01:28:53.527]  And the elite, as Bill Joy wrote in the April issue in 2000 in Wired Magazine, the elite don't need us anymore.
[01:28:53.887 --> 01:28:55.308]  Why the future doesn't need us?
[01:28:55.668 --> 01:28:56.709]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:28:56.729 --> 01:28:59.450]  Not only do they not need us, but we've become very expensive.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.222]  I mean, let's just look at the numbers in the United States.
[01:29:03.242 --> 01:29:12.608]  In the United States, if you look at the national debt before the bank bailouts, each American had about $38,000 of national debt.
[01:29:13.429 --> 01:29:25.457]  If you count up the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and other contingent liabilities, and you say, what's the present value of those contingent liabilities, it's about $138,000, so more than, say, four times the current national debt.
[01:29:29.884 --> 01:29:35.676]  And so we've literally, in one sense, the baby boomers have reached a point where we're worth more dead than alive.
[01:29:38.121 --> 01:29:39.143]  Just looking at the numbers.
[01:29:40.094 --> 01:29:54.518]  So if they succeed with this technological extermination grid that the White House Science Czar talks about, if all the population manipulation and reduction we've seen was just testing, what is the endgame?
[01:29:54.538 --> 01:29:59.059]  I mean, if they are able to carry this out, how do you see it unfolding?
[01:29:59.279 --> 01:30:01.719]  Well, frankly, I don't think they're going to be able to carry it out.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:07.741]  I mean, I'm not saying they're not going to try, but it's a very big planet.
[01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:33.267]  What all of us need to understand is, in a world where, let's just take as an assumption that we can be irradiated by a satellite, by invisible weaponry from space, how do you push back against something that is that ubiquitous, both in terms of ability to force, ability to manipulate, whether it's through the media, your iPhone, or whatever?
[01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:34.608]  How do you do it?
[01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:37.530]  And if you look back through history,
[01:30:38.331 --> 01:30:45.955]  What you will see is where, you know, John Adams said the revolution was not the war, the revolution was in the hearts and the minds of the people.
[01:30:46.855 --> 01:30:55.179]  And Alex, we're talking about a point of view and a way of being which is unbelievably black.
[01:30:56.019 --> 01:31:02.082]  And if there's one thing I know about people, people are fundamentally healthy and people are fundamentally grounded.
[01:31:02.702 --> 01:31:06.344]  And they just do not go along with this kind of blackness.
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:16.303]  Now, it can do incredible harm on the way, but you're talking about ultimately a government that doesn't have what the Chinese call the Mandate of Heaven.
[01:31:16.323 --> 01:31:32.487]  You know, it's something that's based on a culture which is too perverted, too unhealthy, and too lacking in the kind of open transparency and
[01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:36.707]  You know, it sits in its own bell jar.
[01:31:37.027 --> 01:31:43.568]  So you're saying there's going to be a revolution even within the control system and the elite, not having the stomach to carry all this out.
[01:31:44.008 --> 01:31:58.471]  The problem is, and correct me if I'm wrong, if that's not what you mean by that, or this revolution in the mind, and I agree with you, that's happening, as members of the mid-level establishment really figure out, my God, this really is a giant extermination system.
[01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:17.545]  Then, we see them racing to go to full robotic aircraft, full robotic tanks, full remote control systems, where you have robotic factories that manufacture and that engage in the upkeep of the systems, and then it's all deployed.
[01:32:18.045 --> 01:32:22.209]  Basically, a Terminator Skynet system is what they're building, but it's controlled by humans.
[01:32:23.565 --> 01:32:29.987]  You cannot run a large operation or enterprise, let alone a world government, on force.
[01:32:30.747 --> 01:32:33.348]  It has to have some kind of moral authority.
[01:32:33.988 --> 01:32:39.090]  It has to have some kind of vision and values that inspire its members to be loyal.
[01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:40.350]  Force is not enough.
[01:32:40.670 --> 01:32:45.592]  And so that's why they stage terror attacks and the elite play the part of the victim?
[01:32:48.333 --> 01:32:52.334]  You know, it depends on which one, because remember that the elites are fighting.
[01:32:53.853 --> 01:33:01.619]  What you've got is you've got a situation where, because the elite is a pretty big group, but many of these people are prisoners of the system.
[01:33:02.339 --> 01:33:06.142]  In other words, they're part of what I call the central banking warfare model.
[01:33:06.702 --> 01:33:11.066]  And that model, Alex, the important thing to understand about that model is to date it's worked.
[01:33:12.327 --> 01:33:13.247]  I'll give you an example.
[01:33:14.228 --> 01:33:20.393]  In the summer of 2000, that was a busy summer, I was at a revival for Christian women in Atlanta.
[01:33:20.453 --> 01:33:20.753]  T.D.
[01:33:20.793 --> 01:33:21.714]  Jakes from Dallas.
[01:33:22.546 --> 01:33:40.730]  Your state had rented the Georgia Dome and had women there at least, and I was sitting there with 100,000 African-American women, and I was taking a spiritual warfare course with a pastor, and I was there with the church, and this particular pastor had worked at DEA.
[01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:43.830]  And T.D.
[01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:52.112]  Jakes brought George W. Bush in by monitor, and the whole crowd jumped up cheering for George W. Bush, including this pastor.
[01:33:52.759 --> 01:34:01.645]  When it was over, now, what I hadn't explained earlier in my background was I ended up in very serious litigation with the federal government that went on for years and years and years.
[01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:05.668]  And, you know, I always say I played Will Smith.
[01:34:05.788 --> 01:34:08.110]  If you've ever seen, you've seen the movie Enemy of the State, right?
[01:34:08.150 --> 01:34:08.390]  Yes.
[01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:10.211]  Okay, well, I played Will Smith in real life.
[01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:12.553]  It just took me a lot longer to find Gene Hackman.
[01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:19.418]  Anyway, so this minister cheered, stood up and cheered, and after it was over I said,
[01:34:20.825 --> 01:34:30.573]  Patricia, I lost six million dollars and I almost lost my life trying to stop Clinton and Bush family narcotics trafficking and you just jumped up and cheered for this guy.
[01:34:30.593 --> 01:34:32.494]  And she said, well he's going to be the winner.
[01:34:32.534 --> 01:34:34.196]  And I said, so he's a winner and I'm a loser?
[01:34:34.216 --> 01:34:35.237]  And she said, yeah, that's right.
[01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:37.618]  That's it.
[01:34:37.659 --> 01:34:41.782]  They feel like they're part of the power structure even though it's going to destroy them.
[01:34:42.287 --> 01:34:43.328]  Well, but here's the thing.
[01:34:43.768 --> 01:34:51.856]  We have 57% of households in America now headed for 67% are dependent on government money.
[01:34:52.276 --> 01:34:55.219]  In other words, you know, I call it the taperoom economy.
[01:34:55.239 --> 01:34:57.821]  It's like having a taperoom.
[01:34:57.861 --> 01:35:05.789]  The taperoom injects into you a chemical that makes you, you know, do what's good for you, what's good for the taperoom, and so the taperoom grows stronger and you grow weaker.
[01:35:06.821 --> 01:35:10.562]  Right now, the majority of us are practicing a philosophy of follow the tape.
[01:35:10.823 --> 01:35:21.947]  All that needs to happen, Alex, if you could get a critical mass, say, you know, the 100 monkey syndrome, if you could get 6-10% of the people saying, you know, I'm not going to go along with this, I'm going to withdraw.
[01:35:21.967 --> 01:35:25.548]  Because you don't want to have a fight with them, you don't want to get in a fight with the satellites.
[01:35:26.765 --> 01:35:31.229]  You just want to say, you know something, I'm pulling my money out of your game, because your game is shrinking.
[01:35:31.649 --> 01:35:35.593]  The problem with a centralization economically is it's shrinking the wealth.
[01:35:35.653 --> 01:35:48.926]  It's making a few people a little wealthier, but it's literally like if our body was in trauma, you know, if you or I got hit by a car, our body was in trauma, the body would preserve the blood for the heart, the lungs, and the brain.
[01:35:49.586 --> 01:35:59.293]  What's happening now is the economic body is preserving the blood for the toes and the fingers, and it's cutting off the blood from the heart and the brains.
[01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:01.515]  And that's why we're literally contemplating
[01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:03.811]  You know, is this depopulation?
[01:36:03.851 --> 01:36:09.292]  Because you're literally killing off the real economy so you can centralize it.
[01:36:09.312 --> 01:36:15.834]  Because when you flood a country with this much government money and government debt to keep things going, that's what you're doing.
[01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:20.136]  You're basically shrinking the pie of wealth in a way that centralizes it.
[01:36:20.416 --> 01:36:26.438]  But people are going along, and the minute we decide, you know, something, this is really unhealthy,
[01:36:27.946 --> 01:36:31.968]  This can't go in any place that's good for us, our children, our grandchildren.
[01:36:32.468 --> 01:36:34.550]  And we start to shift in theory.
[01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:37.311]  This does not have to be picking a fight.
[01:36:37.431 --> 01:36:38.472]  It's just withdrawing.
[01:36:38.552 --> 01:36:51.040]  So, if we turn off our TVs so we withdraw our time, if we withdraw our money from the big financial institutions and the big banks and start what I call demonetizing,
[01:36:52.884 --> 01:37:03.372]  Um, if you come into any county in America, Alex, you will find, you know, literally one person has got their savings and bank CDs that are in a large New York bank.
[01:37:03.911 --> 01:37:04.191]  Exactly!
[01:37:04.211 --> 01:37:06.252]  They should be loaning to each other and keeping it all local.
[01:37:31.977 --> 01:37:32.197]  Right.
[01:37:32.598 --> 01:37:34.340]  Let me give you another example.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:39.225]  In Tennessee, here's where the opportunity is.
[01:37:39.785 --> 01:37:44.610]  When you start to dig in and you bring transparency to how the money works in a place, and you say,
[01:37:45.632 --> 01:37:53.698]  Let's withdraw from the tapeworm system in a way that makes us money, because the problem we have is our wealth is shrinking.
[01:37:54.099 --> 01:38:01.444]  So we need to find a way to withdraw from the system that expands our wealth and stops us from getting drained financially.
[01:38:01.945 --> 01:38:06.288]  So, for example, I can't tell you how many communities and counties
[01:38:06.897 --> 01:38:07.418]  We're good to go.
[01:38:20.618 --> 01:38:31.567]  And they should go in and take control of their counties and make the county spend the money with the locals, but they don't because one big fat cat wants to keep it all for themselves just at a primitive level.
[01:38:31.787 --> 01:38:34.910]  They don't want anybody else in a little town getting uppity.
[01:38:35.290 --> 01:38:45.638]  They have the same neurosis that the elite has, an instinctive need to keep people down around them, but in the process they destroy their own future.
[01:38:45.838 --> 01:38:47.920]  Well, but I think most people are scared.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:48.941]  It's complicated.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.723]  It's scared, how do you organize to do something that's effective?
[01:38:52.743 --> 01:38:53.924]  Now let me give you an example.
[01:38:54.585 --> 01:39:04.275]  In Florida and Tennessee, the, I'm sure it's more states too, the food, we now, I live in Tennessee, 20% of our population is now on food stamps.
[01:39:04.295 --> 01:39:05.616]  20% Alex.
[01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:15.254]  There was a woman in Florida who worked all her life and then lost her job when the economy went down.
[01:39:15.854 --> 01:39:31.067]  She got food stamps, she had probably one of the food stamps, called the food stamp hotline, the customer service line, to discover that the woman she was talking to, who was helping, you know, doing customer service for her food stamps, worked for JPMorgan Chase in India.
[01:39:32.068 --> 01:39:34.871]  Okay, so the government is paying her not to work.
[01:39:35.726 --> 01:39:39.527]  At the same time, the government is paying somebody in India to do a job she could do.
[01:39:40.227 --> 01:39:43.348]  This doesn't make any sense, because the government is paying twice.
[01:39:44.108 --> 01:39:49.149]  But it's a payoff the government's doing to India to go under the globalist model.
[01:39:50.049 --> 01:39:50.989]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:39:51.549 --> 01:40:01.131]  If I run a government contract through a stock that's trading at 20 times earnings, so let's say my stock is trading at 20 times earnings,
[01:40:01.721 --> 01:40:04.922]  I give a government contract for $100 million.
[01:40:05.422 --> 01:40:08.404]  They make $10 million in profit on that government contract.
[01:40:08.784 --> 01:40:10.544]  Their stock goes up $200 million.
[01:40:11.025 --> 01:40:14.686]  That gives them the capital gains they need to donate to elections.
[01:40:15.206 --> 01:40:22.269]  If you look at campaign donations, the majority of that money comes from capital gains on either real estate or stock.
[01:40:23.454 --> 01:40:29.799]  And the way you get a stock to go up is by giving it lots of government contracts or government purchases or changing the rules.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:40.348]  I have a great article I wrote called Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Profits, and it was about how much money a stock at prisons, private prison stock trades on how many beds it has.
[01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:42.329]  So think of this as slavery.
[01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:47.654]  At the time I wrote the article, every additional bed you get cost your stock to go up $25,000.
[01:40:49.497 --> 01:41:07.965]  So the more, if you can pass a law that says, you know, mandated sentences are longer, the stocks will go up just on the passage of the law anticipating the... And the average American doesn't know that big banks that own and control prison complexes openly come in and give money
[01:41:09.355 --> 01:41:11.476]  Well, what's interesting is, if we reached a point where
[01:41:28.727 --> 01:41:42.615]  Um, where a significant, and I mean the six to ten percent, like the hundred monkey syndrome, if we could get a critical mass of people to see how the game is played and how it works around the money, that's when things start to change.
[01:41:42.735 --> 01:41:54.142]  Now, you know, in 1997, and let me tell you the story, in 1997, remember, I'm trying to persuade the pension funds to reinvest in America.
[01:41:55.445 --> 01:42:02.950]  In a way that really could have made the pension fund tremendous amounts of money compared to the way they've lost money in all these frauds.
[01:42:03.591 --> 01:42:12.938]  So, in 1997, I had a wonderful board of pension fund leaders, including the president of CalPERS, which is the largest pension fund in the country.
[01:42:14.759 --> 01:42:21.845]  And I gave them my presentation of how we could reinvest in America in a way that would make a lot of money for the pension fund.
[01:42:22.739 --> 01:42:25.582]  And the president of CalPERS looked at me and he said, you don't understand.
[01:42:25.602 --> 01:42:26.443]  It's too late.
[01:42:27.004 --> 01:42:28.325]  They've given up on the country.
[01:42:28.365 --> 01:42:31.389]  They're moving all the money out starting in the fall.
[01:42:31.509 --> 01:42:31.869]  And that was 1997.
[01:42:31.909 --> 01:42:34.052]  And so the fall of 1997 was the beginning of federal fiscal 1998.
[01:42:34.272 --> 01:42:35.353]  And that's when $4 trillion dollars
[01:42:42.654 --> 01:42:42.874]  Stay there.
[01:42:42.934 --> 01:42:43.394]  Final segment.
[01:42:43.414 --> 01:42:43.835]  This is riveting.
[01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:05.909]  Aaron Aqua dot com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[01:43:05.929 --> 01:43:10.231]  Aaron Aqua dot com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:14.413]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[01:43:14.733 --> 01:43:19.275]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:43:19.495 --> 01:43:23.177]  Aaron Aqua dot com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:25.978]  Aaron Aqua dot com carries atmospheric water
[01:43:27.839 --> 01:43:28.699]  We're good to go.
[01:43:59.531 --> 01:44:03.196]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:03.556 --> 01:44:06.540]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.202]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:08.928 --> 01:44:11.589]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:17.812]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:17.993 --> 01:44:22.995]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:23.515 --> 01:44:33.160]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.381]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:35.621 --> 01:44:36.922]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:37.202 --> 01:44:39.483]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:39.663 --> 01:44:41.524]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:41.784 --> 01:44:46.607]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:51.709]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:44:59.033 --> 01:45:00.315]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:45:00.636 --> 01:45:04.181]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[01:45:04.662 --> 01:45:12.434]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love and caring.
[01:45:16.067 --> 01:45:18.188]  As the two things that you've asked for most.
[01:45:18.808 --> 01:45:24.251]  Easy to make prepared meals that taste great and a smaller than one year supply for greater affordability.
[01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:33.355]  I don't have to tell you that the troubled times and loss of freedoms that we only anticipated in 2008 have arrived in our lives with a vengeance.
[01:45:33.835 --> 01:45:42.779]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours, and comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate.

[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:49.122]  We here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace, security, and plenty this holiday season.
[01:46:17.093 --> 01:46:22.296]  Catherine Austin Fitch is a very impressive lady, and I'm glad we hooked back up with her and have her on.
[01:46:22.316 --> 01:46:26.919]  Mother, she said she'll come back on in two weeks, and I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.822]  I was just flattered for her to tell me that she actually bought a copy of the Obama deception.
[01:46:30.842 --> 01:46:33.064]  We're going to mail her a copy of Fall of the Republic.
[01:46:33.404 --> 01:46:36.146]  I don't have time to play it, but we have the CNN clip now.
[01:46:36.746 --> 01:46:39.968]  It'll be up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com after the show.
[01:46:40.548 --> 01:46:42.430]  CNN talking about Fall of the Republic.
[01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:44.291]  And not in a nice way.
[01:47:00.769 --> 01:47:03.290]  And believe me, I don't like this as a power trip.
[01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:05.310]  I know it's dangerous going up against these folks.
[01:47:05.890 --> 01:47:07.711]  Catherine, what does it mean, though?
[01:47:08.251 --> 01:47:12.332]  Because on the street, you were just saying during the break, people are saying we're mainstream now.
[01:47:12.352 --> 01:47:14.713]  I mean, people are really listening to us.
[01:47:15.013 --> 01:47:21.315]  We're going from being kind of cutting edge to being passe in a way.
[01:47:23.539 --> 01:47:33.530]  But, I mean, does that creep you out to know that the system is going from being arrogant about us to now actually sitting up and going, you know, danger Will Robinson.
[01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.153]  I mean, I see them putting out alarm flares.
[01:47:36.313 --> 01:47:38.455]  Remember, the corporate media
[01:47:38.976 --> 01:47:43.439]  But don't they know that's not going to work anymore because they've lost all credibility?
[01:48:03.507 --> 01:48:10.657]  Well, that's why, you know, they keep getting closer and closer to what we're saying, because they're trying to protect the channel as our audience grows.
[01:48:11.238 --> 01:48:16.065]  What was Obama, because we talked during the break, what is Obama all about?
[01:48:16.206 --> 01:48:16.967]  Who is Obama?
[01:48:17.841 --> 01:48:20.322]  Well, I think Obama was somebody who was profiled.
[01:48:20.362 --> 01:48:40.975]  In other words, you know, a lot of smart money said, look, we have engaged in massive financial fraud, this thing is a bubble, and essentially we're going to pump and dump it, but on the dump, if we don't do something, we are really going to have trouble maintaining control.
[01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:46.518]  And so I think the question for them was who, you know, what kind of candidate
[01:48:47.193 --> 01:48:54.835]  And what kind of sort of new president could maintain the control?
[01:48:54.875 --> 01:49:03.358]  Because remember, what you always want to do is present people with a style choice that makes them feel good, so you don't have to give them any money.
[01:49:04.051 --> 01:49:13.397]  What is happening is we're fundamentally renegotiating the relationship between labor and capital, and they needed somebody who could consolidate their position.
[01:49:14.117 --> 01:49:28.586]  And what we've seen is, from the time that Obama became the candidate, he has used his political credibility to essentially make possible a $12 trillion gift to the banking system.
[01:49:28.846 --> 01:49:30.907]  And it's quite extraordinary, Alex, because
[01:49:32.050 --> 01:49:38.492]  $12 trillion is the total amount of money that the United States government has borrowed since the Revolutionary War.
