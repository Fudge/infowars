[00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:02.823]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:05.864]  We're going to go right back to Luke Radowski.
[00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:11.586]  We Are Change reporting live for InfoWars.com and WeAreChange.org on the ground in D.C.
[00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.688]  And we just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:22.891]  We have his video feed up there right now from on the ground for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv as well.
[00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:26.415]  Luke, specifically, report for us the facts.
[00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:34.325]  Did you get through the first line of checkpoints and describe for us exactly what you witnessed with the military troops searching people?
[00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:38.455]  Well, we did not get through any search or checkpoints.
[00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:40.616]  We were not able to at any point in time.
[00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:43.358]  They pretty much closed off all of DC.
[00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:46.660]  We are in trap right now with black fences all around us.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.602]  We have a huge crowd all around us, outside the main point.
[00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:54.305]  But we are right on Pennsylvania Avenue, right outside the main address of Barack Obama.
[00:00:54.365 --> 00:01:01.329]  And to the left side, if you look to the left side, if you pan the camera down over there, you are able to see the checkpoint.
[00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.350]  You are able to see the National Guard.
[00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.211]  You are able to see the
[00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.152]  Huge, huge police state presence here in Washington, D.C.
[00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:19.957]  And again, we are in a huge crowd, there are people crying, there are people going into static gear, not understanding how this is just a continuation of the policies and beliefs of the New World Order, of the...
[00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:23.579]  It's turning America into a prison with these free speech zones and the rest of it.
[00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.100]  Yes, I see your cameraman panning, Luke.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.203]  Have him pan into those police and troops that are over your other shoulder.
[00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:33.664]  Let's show the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that.
[00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:40.347]  But for radio listeners, describe what the troops are doing, how they're searching people, who they're letting through.
[00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:41.728]  Are you seeing them turn people away?
[00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:45.048]  Yeah, they are turning a lot of people away.
[00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:46.329]  They've closed off everything.
[00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:47.370]  There's nowhere to go.
[00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.992]  We are trapped with huge amounts of people all around us.
[00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:54.175]  There's National Guard just standing around keeping an eye on everybody.
[00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:58.218]  Everybody's basically entrapped in these free speech zones, in these black
[00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:02.243]  And I can see National Guard on the screen.
[00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:04.206]  I can see the National Guard.
[00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:19.942]  I see if your cameraman can get around a few of those people and up to the fence, because I can see the National Guard, but the video's a bit pixelated.
[00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:33.972]  Again, this is the great technological developments of the free Internet that they're openly, and Obama and Biden have announced they're going to be shutting down and forcing everybody onto Internet, too, where this will not be allowed, except for major media companies to even do things like this.
[00:02:35.513 --> 00:02:43.258]  So, again, they can't stand the fact that we're able to show the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and everybody else this video, thanks to the great work that We Are Change is doing down there.
[00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:52.247]  Now, Luke, do I get you right that they're selectively not letting some people in, but they're letting other people in at the checkpoints?
[00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:55.870]  How are they discriminating to decide who they're going to let in and who they're not going to let in?
[00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:58.413]  Well, right now you can't have any bags.
[00:02:58.473 --> 00:02:59.654]  You can't have any signs.
[00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:01.696]  You can't have pretty much anything.
[00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:04.979]  There are signs posted up anywhere that you could be searched at any time.
[00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.601]  There are signs saying that you cannot have
[00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:10.469]  Pretty much anything to go through the major checkpoint security line right now.
[00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.571]  It looks like most of the speech is ending right now.
[00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:15.351]  The National Guard are here.
[00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.712]  I don't know if you can see it on camera.
[00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:17.272]  Yes, we can see them.
[00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:20.653]  They're in the middle of the street, but they're literally on every street corner.
[00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:29.437]  We walked around here for about 40 blocks trying to get into the main checkpoint area, and we were not able to at any point or time, and literally everyone...
[00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:35.487]  And again, billions of people worldwide, they're saying around 3 billion people are tuned into this.
[00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:36.548]  They're all being conditioned.
[00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:39.970]  The troops on the streets, checkpoints, people being searched is normal.
[00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.631]  And folks in the past would deny that this was conditioning.
[00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:48.054]  Now they admit they're going to use these 20,000 troops and growing against the American people.
[00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:51.856]  They have stated on record that this is to be used
[00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:58.661]  Four civil insurrection against the American people and Barack Obama says get ready for pain, get ready for skin in the game.
[00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:08.608]  His wife in these public service announcements is saying get ready for really hard times because they are allowing the banks to steal trillions of dollars a week from the American people.
[00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:09.949]  This is a mass heist!
[00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.676]  And those troops compartmentalized unknowingly are there to make sure that the heist goes according to plan.
[00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:23.385]  Again, earlier we could hear Obama finishing his speech in the background and the cheers of the mindless sheep as they go into the depths of a Stalin-esque system.
[00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:24.006]  Continue.
[00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:32.022]  Yeah, we're going to be going, we're going to be doing interviews with people on the street here right after we get off the phone with you, but it looks like everything is under right now.
[00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:34.103]  We're still in traffic here on Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:38.245]  We're covering everything live at this hot thing right here by one of the major checkpoints.
[00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.846]  They're not allowing anybody in.
[00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:43.808]  We're going to try to get in at some places, but we're here covering everything live.
[00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:44.888]  It's not ending.
[00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:46.129]  Biden's giving a speech.
[00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:47.429]  Others are going to give speeches.
[00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.390]  In fact, hold on one second, Luke.
[00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:00.713]  I'm going to come back to you for about five minutes on the other side before Congressman Ron Paul joins us live on this coronation day of the elite's would-be messiah that they're hoping the public signs on to.
[00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:05.074]  Cut into the live feed from the inauguration itself.
[00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:05.874]  Cut into the other feed.
[00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:08.675]  Now let's go ahead and cut that outro music.
[00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:10.175]  We'll go out with one of the speeches.
[00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:11.096]  Here we go.
[00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:11.576]  Stay with us.
[00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:14.919]  Okay, folks, we'll go ahead and send you that audio.
[00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:16.380]  Through to folks.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.362]  Okay, we got multiple feeds from on the ground and via television.
[00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:22.484]  Words spiny, whispered or declaimed.
[00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:25.166]  We're going to come back and go to that after break.
[00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:26.587]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:27.187]  We're going to break.
[00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:29.348]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:41.357]  Roads and highways that mark the will of someone than others who said, I need to see what's on the other side.
[00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:45.259]  I know there's something better down the road.

[00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.077]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:07:34.418 --> 00:07:36.100]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.242]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:40.264]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:07:40.604 --> 00:07:42.006]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:43.127]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:48.891]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:56.413]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:58.054]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:07:58.274 --> 00:08:02.175]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:06.017]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:08:06.257 --> 00:08:10.358]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.579]  Phase One is a One World Currency.
[00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:13.600]  We're good to go.
[00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:58.108]  Ron Paul, leader of a true grassroots movement, not a phony New World Order grassroots movement, to bring the people into world government and total socialism and micromanagement by the elite.
[00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:01.690]  He'll be joining us in T-minus five minutes.
[00:09:05.771 --> 00:09:10.033]  And then, Mike Rivera will sit in for about 30 minutes while I'm on Russia Today.
[00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.194]  We may simulcast that, we're not sure.
[00:09:16.374 --> 00:09:17.495]  I'm not giving up my liberty.
[00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:20.436]  We are taking the fight to the enemy.
[00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:25.198]  Battle stations, battle stations, battle stations in the Info War.
[00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:29.580]  I noticed that Luke's on the ground talking to some Obamanoids.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.121]  We'll get him back on the air later, but let's go back to Luke.
[00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:36.662]  Luke, let's talk to some of these Obamanoids.
[00:09:36.703 --> 00:09:42.145]  Let's talk to some of these cult members who are well-meaning but have been completely conned, just like Bush supporters were.
[00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:44.907]  Luke Rodowski on the ground in D.C.
[00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:47.449]  There were the National Guard troops surrounding him.
[00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.792]  No, no, but you're saying you can't end the war.
[00:09:49.832 --> 00:09:51.453]  We got some people right here we're talking to.
[00:09:51.493 --> 00:09:52.454]  Why can't we end the war?
[00:09:52.574 --> 00:09:57.399]  You can't end the war instantly the way American people think that it can happen.
[00:09:57.859 --> 00:09:59.480]  It has to be a strategic planning.
[00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:04.065]  Because you will murder more American soldiers if you just pull them out instantly.
[00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:04.585]  Oh, really?
[00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:05.626]  You'll murder more soldiers?
[00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:07.488]  Fade the city of town for a minute.
[00:10:09.795 --> 00:10:10.295]  You hear this?
[00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:13.077]  This is what Bush has said to keep us in there five-and-a-half years.
[00:10:13.757 --> 00:10:16.419]  He promised six months, five-and-a-half, almost six years later.
[00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:17.759]  This is the same.
[00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:25.344]  Now they've picked up all the Bush M.O., which is really the elite propaganda, and then notice this lady a year ago, I guarantee, was bashing Bush, saying, end it now.
[00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:29.106]  Now, since Obama's saying we've got to keep them in there for a few more years, listen to her.
[00:10:29.146 --> 00:10:29.646]  Go back to her.
[00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.834]  Yeah, we're trying to explain that Obama is for a surge in Afghanistan.
[00:10:34.854 --> 00:10:38.078]  He's going to take the troops from Iraq and send them to Afghanistan.
[00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:40.740]  I mean, that's not ending war, is it?
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.424]  Luke, ask her this question, Luke.
[00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:46.406]  Luke, give her the phone.
[00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:48.408]  I want to talk to her.
[00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:49.108]  Give her the phone.
[00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:54.536]  Who am I speaking with?
[00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:55.137]  Alex Jones.
[00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:56.659]  Hello Alex Jones.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.082]  Hi ma'am, how you doing?
[00:10:58.102 --> 00:11:01.206]  Listen, listen, we're not Bush supporters, we're not Republicans.
[00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:05.433]  We know that Obama has the same advisors and is going to betray everybody.
[00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.716]  Remember he said he was going to pull the troops out.
[00:11:08.597 --> 00:11:09.178]  Let me just finish.
[00:11:09.859 --> 00:11:12.820]  Now, now he's saying he's not going to.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.040]  He said he wouldn't have wiretaps against the American people without warrants.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.501]  Now he's saying he's going ahead.
[00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:20.041]  He said he was going to get rid of the Patriot Act.
[00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:22.441]  Now he's saying he's not going to do that.
[00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:27.882]  All we're saying is, is that you are... Here's my question, and then I'll let you answer it.
[00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:31.643]  You are saying that if we pull all the troops out, more will get killed, more troops.
[00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:38.844]  The troops can't be killed if they're pulled out of Iraq, and all the major governmental studies admit that if the troops are pulled out, there'll be less deaths on all sides.
[00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.636]  But strategically, he has to pull the troops out.
[00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:47.361]  And we can't also, we cannot abandon, and I'm a person against war.
[00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:52.887]  And it's funny because all my family is military and we have arguments at our table all the time.
[00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:58.974]  But I truly understand that we just can't go in and say, okay, we're pulling all these troops out and we leave the people in Iraq.
[00:11:59.815 --> 00:12:00.215]  No, no, no, no, no!
[00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:00.336]  Now, I...
[00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:26.354]  I guess you don't understand my argument, because when he was talking about how he was going to pull the troops out, I was one of the first people who ever said, where I live at, he can't do that.
[00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:29.919]  And he's going to have troops in longer than what he expects to have in there.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.845]  But what I'm saying is that the American people have to wise up themselves and realize,
[00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:35.535]  We just can't.
[00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.455]  You're beeping.
[00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:37.796]  Somebody's beeping.
[00:12:38.676 --> 00:12:42.657]  We just can't pull those tubes out the way he says he will.
[00:12:43.037 --> 00:12:46.378]  And American people are blind to the fact that it will not happen that way.
[00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.478]  Ma'am, I have one other question for you and I'm going to let you go.
[00:12:48.498 --> 00:12:49.899]  We've got Congressman Ron Paul coming up.
[00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:52.639]  Go ahead and get him online, John, in Minnesota.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.000]  And it's this.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.761]  You've heard about his National Compulsory Service 18 to 24.
[00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:00.922]  Do you support forced National Compulsory Service?
[00:13:02.062 --> 00:13:02.342]  Okay.
[00:13:03.843 --> 00:13:05.204]  I've heard briefly about that, yes.
[00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:06.966]  Do you support that?
[00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:08.607]  No.
[00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:17.075]  Okay, do you support that Obama spearheaded the banker takeover that's now $8.5 trillion and it's secret and they won't say where it is?
[00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:21.218]  Just like Bush supported it, Obama says we have to have another banker bailout.
[00:13:21.238 --> 00:13:21.959]  Do you support that?
[00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:24.761]  No, I'm not into bailout at all.
[00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:26.302]  So what is it you support?
[00:13:26.363 --> 00:13:29.125]  What is it, ma'am, you support about Barack Obama?
[00:13:33.118 --> 00:13:52.476]  I am torn between supporting him, to be honest with you, and my family is a family full of Democrats, so I'm torn between supporting him and any political party at this point in time, because I think the American people with both parties have been deceived, and we as Americans have to open up our eyes and decide what we're going to do for our country.
[00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:56.879]  He's a corporate created foundation front man.
[00:13:56.939 --> 00:13:58.220]  He is going to betray you.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.583]  Don't sign on like the Germans did or the Russians did to Stalin and then sign on to all his evil.
[00:14:04.603 --> 00:14:08.765]  Like conservatives signed on to Bush and then the torture, the secret arrest, the wars.
[00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:10.385]  Don't be conned.
[00:14:10.425 --> 00:14:11.026]  God bless you.
[00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:13.447]  Luke Rudowsky on the ground in Washington, D.C.
[00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:16.948]  surrounded by regular army troops and National Guard searching everyone.
[00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:19.029]  We'll talk to you coming up in the next hour.
[00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:22.611]  Luke Rudowsky, thanks for reporting for InfoWars.com from the streets of D.C.
[00:14:23.692 --> 00:14:24.092]  Okay.
[00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:25.353]  Thank you so much, I'm here.
[00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:28.854]  Doing everything live, talking to people.
[00:14:28.874 --> 00:14:30.254]  We're going to be talking to more people.
[00:14:30.554 --> 00:14:33.355]  We're going to be talking to people as long as the battery dies.
[00:14:33.515 --> 00:14:35.435]  Okay, look, look, look, look.
[00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:36.216]  We've got to jump.
[00:14:36.816 --> 00:14:40.777]  Again, they're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv with a video feed from there on the ground.
[00:14:40.837 --> 00:14:46.319]  Now, without further ado, Congressman Ron Paul, for the next 20 minutes, joins us.
[00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:50.760]  Congressman, the 44th President, with messianic media coverage.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.321]  I mean, is this good in history?
[00:14:53.601 --> 00:15:03.487]  We've never seen this in American history, to have someone being worshipped and the media saying, get behind him, do whatever he says, and then Obama says another banker bailout, a new bank of the U.S.
[00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:19.356]  that's private, just youth brigades, he's formed usaservice.org, a private army for himself to go out and ensure his policies, literally out of Mao's playbook, congressman.
[00:15:20.572 --> 00:15:24.613]  Well, no, I don't think it's a good idea at all, and he can fool a lot of people.
[00:15:25.073 --> 00:15:29.714]  But, you know, I was watching the speech that he gave on the business station.
[00:15:29.794 --> 00:15:30.474]  It was interesting.
[00:15:30.895 --> 00:15:32.515]  He wasn't reassuring the markets.
[00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:36.236]  I mean, gold is up sharply, and the Dow Jones is down sharply.
[00:15:36.296 --> 00:15:42.597]  So if he really was reassuring us that he was going to take care of us, I think the markets would have acted differently.
[00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:48.839]  But a lot of people are fooled, and a lot of people are expecting a whole lot and think that he is going to be a savior.
[00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:51.964]  But I think it will be short-lived.
[00:15:52.604 --> 00:16:05.789]  Congressman, as you know, they've introduced a new bill to give dictatorial power to the Attorney General to where he can ban any semi-automatic or any, quote, rifles that could have a military use.
[00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:08.670]  Most rifles and shotguns and handguns.
[00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.130]  That has been introduced.
[00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.631]  They're introducing a bill to nationally register all firearms.
[00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:17.933]  I mean, out of the gates, he's saying he's going to call for a carbon tax
[00:16:18.773 --> 00:16:20.895]  And declare CO2 a toxic waste.
[00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:23.876]  We thought Bush tripling the size of government was bad.
[00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:24.917]  What are we facing, sir?
[00:16:24.937 --> 00:16:29.420]  And what are the biggest threats right now from the new Obama administration that just launched?
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.504]  Well, he'll make it grow much faster if the whole system hangs together for that long.
[00:16:36.144 --> 00:16:42.448]  But the big question is whether there's going to be a collapse of the dollar and all bets are off on what will transpire then.
[00:16:42.908 --> 00:16:47.291]  But no, if we go along with the system held together relatively so,
[00:16:47.904 --> 00:16:50.325]  I mean, he's going to massively increase the government.
[00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:56.489]  I think there'll be national youth service, and also possibility of a military draft.
[00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:58.670]  I think there'll be expansion of operations overseas.
[00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.293]  And the only way they know how to pay for any of this is printing more money.
[00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.274]  That's why it's a contest.
[00:17:05.354 --> 00:17:12.798]  How long can this go on by massively expanding the size of government and undermining the value of the dollar before people give up on the dollar?
[00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:15.658]  So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:17.279]  I find it fascinating.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:22.844]  Tragically, though, it's so dangerous that you can't really sit back and relax about it.
[00:17:22.884 --> 00:17:24.666]  We all have to prepare for what's going on.
[00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:30.850]  We're talking to Congressman Ron Paul from Texas, and he joins us for the Balance of the Hour.
[00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.592]  Congressman, specifically, let's talk about solutions and then get into more of the threats.
[00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:40.695]  Obama, Biden, the pundits, they all admit that he'll have about 150, 200 days.
[00:17:41.215 --> 00:17:54.082]  He's saying he's going to have a blitzkrieg of gun control legislation, illegal alien amnesty, carbon taxes, new federal agencies, new wars, record defense budgets, and they're saying that they know
[00:17:54.682 --> 00:18:02.966]  That things are going to be so bad in the economy, they're saying this in speeches, they're saying it's going to get painful, it's going to be austerity, you know, get ready, we've got to give trillions a week to the bankers.
[00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:16.272]  How important is it now to resist this agenda and point it out and organize the huge Ron Paul liberty movement that Obama mimicked successfully with a false organic movement?
[00:18:16.832 --> 00:18:23.773]  How important is it and how do we mobilize and what are the key things to fight in the first 200 days if we're going to save this republic?
[00:18:23.793 --> 00:18:35.656]  Because you've always talked about that coming crisis when the world government imploded the economy by design so they could rebuild it with even greater control that we could use that key window to reverse it and bring in the culture of liberty.
[00:18:36.496 --> 00:18:42.417]  Well, we have to continue to do exactly what we're doing, trying to win people over to our side, spread the message.
[00:18:42.987 --> 00:18:44.709]  Get the attention of Washington best we can.
[00:18:44.729 --> 00:18:54.959]  Another one way we could look at this in a positive way is those Republicans who wimped along and did everything George Bush told them to do are now resistors.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.402]  So we have more resistance there.
[00:18:57.422 --> 00:19:06.051]  We're going to hear more noise in Washington against Obama than we ever heard against George Bush because the Democrats love George Bush and the Republicans wouldn't say boo.
[00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:22.688]  At least we'll have a little bit of that, but the problem is, is in 100 days or 200 days, I mean, we do our best, but we can't really expect to reverse this tide, because he's assuming that he has this mandate and he's going to march forward.
[00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:29.294]  And how we act when an acute monetary crisis hits is something that has to be determined then.
[00:19:29.847 --> 00:19:33.168]  But in the meantime, people have acted in their own best interest.
[00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:38.570]  It didn't take individuals very long to figure out that there would be more controls on guns.
[00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.551]  All of a sudden, gun sales soared and prices of guns soared.
[00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:45.352]  Ammunition, they're afraid the ammunition will be taken away or registered.
[00:19:45.973 --> 00:19:47.413]  And those prices have soared.
[00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:49.774]  People learn how to make their own ammunition.
[00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:52.835]  So all kinds of things automatically happen.
[00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:57.857]  I don't think you have to have one group or one person tell everybody what they have to do.
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:06.493]  My goal has always been to get information out there and try to counteract these socialistic, totalitarian ideas with the ideas of freedom.
[00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:09.755]  Sir, specifically, you're on the House Banking Committee.
[00:20:10.615 --> 00:20:24.281]  Bloomberg and AP report five weeks ago, the last time we saw numbers, that it was $1,300,000,000,000 a week disappearing and the Federal Reserve will not tell Congress or anywhere else where the money has gone.
[00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:26.582]  Now they're saying they need a trillion more
[00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:32.625]  To quote, unfreeze these toxic derivatives, these instruments.
[00:20:33.005 --> 00:20:38.387]  Can you specifically speak, because now Newsweek has the headline, a world government run by a world bank.
[00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:49.292]  The very people that engineered the crisis are now openly proposing a world government run by the very private central banks that have hijacked our economy and are looting us in a financial coup.
[00:20:49.312 --> 00:20:51.793]  I mean, this is so huge.
[00:20:53.234 --> 00:20:57.877]  It's just hard to even analyze something this brazen with this much chutzpah.
[00:20:59.898 --> 00:21:04.261]  I mean, my question is, you're on the banking committee, we have this giant heist going on.
[00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:09.865]  They're openly announcing the world government, saying we're going to pay carbon taxes to this new central bank.
[00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:11.105]  This is outrageous!
[00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:12.987]  This is totally unpopular in all the polls.
[00:21:13.287 --> 00:21:14.608]  Ninety-eight percent are against it.
[00:21:14.888 --> 00:21:17.830]  How is, I mean, is the elite pinning everything on
[00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:25.774]  Obama, hoping that with his messianic fervor and hype, that somehow he can bring this through and get it done?
[00:21:25.794 --> 00:21:35.119]  I think so, and maybe they also are in deep planning right now for the crisis that we expect.
[00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:40.883]  You know, with the dollar collapse, they want to be in a position worldwide to devise the next system.
[00:21:40.903 --> 00:21:44.965]  So I'm sure, you know, they're making their plans for that as well.
[00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.806]  You know, last week we had a vote
[00:21:47.282 --> 00:21:53.007]  On an amendment on the bill that did not get passed, Barney Frank's bill on the TARP funds.
[00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:59.953]  And the amendment had to do with demanding that the Federal Reserve turn over the information about where all these credits are going.
[00:22:00.453 --> 00:22:03.135]  And I think it passed unanimously.
[00:22:03.475 --> 00:22:04.977]  So the sentiment is changing.
[00:22:05.417 --> 00:22:11.742]  And we are, specifically at my request, going to have hearings in a couple weeks that Barney Frank has agreed to.
[00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:15.005]  And that is to get Bernanke in front of the committee.
[00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.102]  And give us more information about what they're doing.
[00:22:18.742 --> 00:22:20.583]  I don't think much will come of it.
[00:22:20.643 --> 00:22:25.305]  I don't think because we're having these hearings and he's coming, that all of a sudden they're going to do it.
[00:22:25.725 --> 00:22:33.929]  But the sentiment is growing, the people want the information, the people are tired of it, and they're getting frightened, and the members of Congress evidently know about it.
[00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:42.252]  But in the meantime, though, when you hear speeches like we just heard, and the plans being laid, and the internationalism that goes on,
[00:22:43.123 --> 00:22:47.991]  I think there's a lot of plans going on right now on what they're going to replace the dollar system with.
[00:22:48.496 --> 00:22:53.197]  Well, the good news, sir, as you know, everything you've been talking about for thirty years has now come true.
[00:22:53.278 --> 00:23:03.541]  It's sad that you were right, but we've now hit the iceberg, and our credibility as the liberty movement, the freedom movement, libertarian movement, true conservative movement, is exploding right now.
[00:23:03.641 --> 00:23:06.322]  So, I mean, I guess that is the opportunity in all of this.
[00:23:06.342 --> 00:23:16.305]  Now, Henry Kissinger, two weeks ago on MSNBC, I don't know if you saw it, said, Obama is worshipped worldwide, we can use his personality as a
[00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:21.666]  Plus, with this global crisis, to bring in the New World Order.
[00:23:22.927 --> 00:23:31.609]  Yeah, and you know, the first president that ever said that in open discussion was George Bush Sr., when he talked about the New World Order.
[00:23:31.649 --> 00:23:46.493]  Before, many talked about it, and we had read about it, and if you believed in it, you know, you were some nut, but George Bush talked about it openly, so it is more likely to be mentioned, and I did hear Kissinger's comments
[00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:57.208]  And I think that's what they're really working on, because they're not going to move back to the original order of individual freedom and limited government and a very small federal government.
[00:23:57.508 --> 00:24:01.911]  That, of course, is what we want, and yet they want to move in the opposite direction.
[00:24:01.972 --> 00:24:10.699]  But, you know, chaos that comes might offer some opportunity as well, because it's going to be very difficult to manage hundreds of millions of people.
[00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:15.817]  I've got on screen for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, for radio listeners, I'm going to play a 30-second clip.
[00:24:16.137 --> 00:24:27.748]  Here is Henry Kissinger saying, use Obama and his incredible world support and the image of him to ram through the new world order, using the crises they've engineered to bring us even deeper under their control.
[00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:28.229]  Here it is.
[00:24:28.249 --> 00:24:33.213]  So he can't really say that it's one problem, that it's the most important one.
[00:24:33.233 --> 00:24:35.576]  But he can give a new impetus
[00:24:36.627 --> 00:24:43.211]  To American foreign policy, partly because the reception of him is so extraordinary around the world.
[00:24:44.032 --> 00:24:53.518]  I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period, when really a new world order can be created.
[00:24:53.578 --> 00:24:54.858]  It's a great opportunity.
[00:24:54.938 --> 00:24:57.160]  It isn't such a crisis.
[00:24:58.433 --> 00:24:59.493]  Are you confident about the future?
[00:24:59.513 --> 00:24:59.793]  Okay.
[00:25:00.814 --> 00:25:18.720]  Congressmen specifically, the Trilateral Commission in 1974, said that within three decades they would engineer a world banking collapse, knowing their fiat system had to implode, and that they would then offer a global bank that sets currency rates for the major ten nations, or major ten regions, Club of Rome said it as well.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.620]  Again, how do we stop this?
[00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:25.002]  Well, I think the market will eventually stop it, because what they're
[00:25:25.592 --> 00:25:28.455]  Trying to impose on us is not workable.
[00:25:28.676 --> 00:25:29.717]  But we don't know the timing.
[00:25:29.777 --> 00:25:33.541]  We knew the Soviet system wouldn't work because socialism doesn't work.
[00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.785]  But just look at the pain and the suffering that occurred for many, many decades.
[00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:42.511]  But it was predicted by Austrian economics that the Soviet system would collapse, and it did.
[00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:45.000]  And what they're proposing can't work either.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.941]  The big thing is politically.
[00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:50.304]  How much pain and suffering are we going to go through?
[00:25:50.624 --> 00:25:54.126]  People should be ready to deal in the market, the real marketplace.
[00:25:54.167 --> 00:26:00.872]  They may have to use gold and silver coins, but internationally, they're going to play games with it.
[00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:04.654]  They're not going to give up easily, but we do know it always fails.
[00:26:05.703 --> 00:26:11.267]  They couldn't maintain the Bretton Woods system, and they can't maintain the system that came out of Bretton Woods.
[00:26:11.287 --> 00:26:15.350]  That's not been maintained, and it's collapsing at this very moment.
[00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.412]  And the one they're talking about won't work either.
[00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:23.936]  The big question is how far along can they get, and will our movement grow fast enough to counteract them?
[00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.030]  Congressman, stay there.
[00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.133]  I'm skipping this network break, not just the PrisonPlanet.tv break.
[00:26:28.473 --> 00:26:31.295]  So John, just suspend this break as we go out.
[00:26:31.315 --> 00:26:32.316]  We're skipping the network breaks.
[00:26:32.336 --> 00:26:34.578]  We're going to go right to the end of the hour with Ron Paul.
[00:26:34.618 --> 00:26:36.460]  This information is too vital.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.222]  This is a network break, so stations, stay with us.
[00:26:39.483 --> 00:26:40.764]  We're going live continually.
[00:26:43.723 --> 00:26:50.518]  Congressman, continuing here with you, sir, live on air, I've been asking a lot of questions, I've been bringing up a lot of points.
[00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:54.346]  What are some points you'd like to make, sir, today to the viewers and listeners?
[00:26:56.454 --> 00:27:03.099]  The optimistic side is that we're very pleased with our organization around the country, especially on the college campuses.
[00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:10.624]  The more I think about it, the more excited I get about reaching out to a generation that most people believe are all with Obama.
[00:27:10.984 --> 00:27:12.165]  I don't happen to believe that.
[00:27:12.545 --> 00:27:17.249]  Even the statistics show that they didn't necessarily come out and vote the way that people thought.
[00:27:17.729 --> 00:27:22.172]  So we should have some optimism that we can reach the next generation.
[00:27:23.931 --> 00:27:40.588]  But we have a lot of activity going on, but we do live in very, very dangerous times, and hopefully we can work within the system before it breaks down completely, which means people should be involved and try to influence their members and get involved in campaigns and try to get me some help in Washington.
[00:27:41.331 --> 00:27:47.514]  Sir, we know that governments love to stage events or use events to get more power and control.
[00:27:47.854 --> 00:27:50.415]  Are you worried about Gulf of Tonkin events continuing?
[00:27:50.495 --> 00:27:54.718]  Obama has said he wants to deal with Iran and swiftly in the next year.
[00:27:54.738 --> 00:27:56.799]  Are you concerned about staged events?
[00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:09.945]  Yes, you know, a year or so ago, I think because so many times we have expressed concerns about this, they actually backed off when we were worried about a staged event for an excuse to go into Iran.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.441]  And Bush backed off, I think, because of some of the publicity we gave to that.
[00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:26.503]  But no, I think all big events like that in foreign policy have to have a staged event or use an event that they can claim is the main reason for going in.
[00:28:27.043 --> 00:28:29.804]  But policies have not changed on foreign policy.
[00:28:29.824 --> 00:28:32.444]  If you listen to his speech, he said nothing that would be different.
[00:28:32.824 --> 00:28:37.425]  He is still, you know, going to follow the same foreign policy.
[00:28:37.725 --> 00:28:38.846]  Well, that's the good news.
[00:28:39.186 --> 00:28:43.148]  I mean, not that he's following the policy, but the good news is I am talking to Obama supporters.
[00:28:43.168 --> 00:28:44.949]  We just talked to one on the ground at D.C.
[00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.511]  and they were admitting, yeah, he is continuing the wars.
[00:28:47.571 --> 00:28:49.432]  Yeah, he is continuing the warrantless wiretapping.
[00:28:49.772 --> 00:28:53.314]  Yeah, he is saying he's going to keep troops in Iraq basically forever, just a smaller group.
[00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:55.756]  Yeah, he is going back on everything he said.
[00:28:55.776 --> 00:28:58.017]  So I see them kind of getting apprehensive.
[00:28:58.057 --> 00:29:00.519]  So the mainstream corporate media, the establishment,
[00:29:00.999 --> 00:29:10.906]  Well, I think this is good that some of the Obama supporters are starting to recognize this, and we shouldn't ignore the fact that some of our allies may well come from the left.
[00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:17.191]  The principled liberal or progressive who doesn't fit the mold of an Obama supporter
[00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:35.321]  We are very concerned about the same things we are, you know, about the Patriot Act and personal liberty and the foreign policy.
[00:29:36.102 --> 00:29:45.587]  And in time, I think that we can work with other groups, because we'll need everybody to point out that it's civil liberties that we want protected.
[00:29:45.607 --> 00:29:47.208]  We want personal liberty protected.
[00:29:47.788 --> 00:29:51.650]  At the same time, we don't need any more wars, which will help us economically.
[00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.913]  You know, the other arguments can be done, but we do need a strong coalition
[00:29:57.403 --> 00:30:04.805]  But you'd never know that we are very strong from the average newscast every day and what we saw today.
[00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:10.026]  But I think our numbers are growing and there's reason for us to continue this effort.
[00:30:11.207 --> 00:30:12.407]  Absolutely, Congressman.
[00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:15.168]  In the four minutes we have left with you,
[00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:43.686]  I want to get you to specifically speak to this, because I know you're a student of history and an avid news hound, and so I specifically wanted to get your take on this, because I've studied Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and literally, even the Washington Post a week ago admitted that the symbolism, the things they're doing is classical fascism or communism, where these evil movements of the state want a true grassroots army, and now with USA
[00:30:44.546 --> 00:31:00.321]  uh... service dot org it's a separate group under obama's control and they're already getting hundreds of thousands it launched a week ago they're running national ad council federally paid for ads promoting his private army which i believe is illegal according to other congressional research it's been done
[00:31:03.483 --> 00:31:04.543]  I hope you'll investigate that.
[00:31:04.563 --> 00:31:07.043]  So specifically, just on that one issue, there's hundreds.
[00:31:07.323 --> 00:31:14.865]  This is classical, the dirtiest, most wicked type of pathogen to a free society, and they're doing it out of the gates!
[00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:17.965]  So can you speak to, I mean, just the whole messianic thing?
[00:31:18.586 --> 00:31:23.467]  Well, the messianic thing is very obvious to most people, and we should be very cautious about it.
[00:31:23.507 --> 00:31:30.668]  As far as a private army goes, I don't know enough to say that I have all the answers on that, but it certainly deserves looking at.
[00:31:31.147 --> 00:31:38.910]  I think the big thing right now, which is progressing as it has been for years and more so now, is not so much that Obama is going to present
[00:31:39.611 --> 00:31:49.635]  Socialism in the Soviet style or government ownership is always going to be this business arrangement between big business and big government.
[00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:50.775]  It's more fascism.
[00:31:50.815 --> 00:31:53.496]  They socialize our wealth and then give it to the banks.
[00:31:54.036 --> 00:31:54.637]  That's right.
[00:31:54.757 --> 00:32:06.321]  And he was emphatic today and said that, yes, markets are good and the free enterprise they do produce, but on occasion they spin out of control and they fail and therefore we have to step in.
[00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:15.534]  What he was saying there, which was what they said in the 30s, is capitalism, gold standard, freedom failed, so therefore we need government.
[00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:17.980]  And just look, do you think the businessmen...
[00:32:18.864 --> 00:32:19.784]  Is resisting that.
[00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.585]  The business is begging you to be partners.
[00:32:21.725 --> 00:32:29.487]  Exactly, but what's really failed is this fascist slash crony capitalism false free market, but they're trying to blame the free market.
[00:32:29.567 --> 00:32:33.028]  In closing, let's get a prediction from Ron Paul or a prime projection.
[00:32:33.648 --> 00:32:38.410]  Do you think he will be overall successful in becoming this messianic demigod?
[00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.790]  They've introduced a thing to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
[00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:45.852]  Do you think in the future Obama will be successful or will liberty defeat him?
[00:32:47.672 --> 00:32:49.273]  I don't think he'll be successful.
[00:32:49.353 --> 00:32:55.835]  I think for a year or two or three, he's going to get away with a lot, and there'll be a strong segment that'll continue to support him.
[00:32:56.635 --> 00:33:01.617]  But I think ultimately, truth wins out in the end, and that's why I remain optimistic.
[00:33:07.313 --> 00:33:20.435]  Okay, I'd have them go to CampaignForLiberty.com and join us, and we are going to have meetings around the country, and we're looking for new members, and we continue to grow, and we're emphasizing a lot of organization on college campuses.
[00:33:20.854 --> 00:33:23.715]  And I would add, in the minute we have left, this is classic.
[00:33:24.076 --> 00:33:24.916]  They saw what you did.
[00:33:24.976 --> 00:33:27.697]  The Obama campaign admitted they mimicked your true grassroots.
[00:33:28.158 --> 00:33:28.758]  They did that.
[00:33:28.898 --> 00:33:29.759]  The media attacked you.
[00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:30.539]  He launched ahead.
[00:33:30.579 --> 00:33:31.099]  He won.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.803]  And so that shows how important a true grassroots movement under liberty and individualism is to counter their collectivist movement.
[00:33:38.823 --> 00:33:39.303]  Do you agree?
[00:33:39.964 --> 00:33:41.364]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:43.105]  And that's the only way it should be.
[00:33:43.806 --> 00:33:46.167]  And I feel pleased about that.
[00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:48.650]  Like, I tried to simplify that.
[00:33:48.991 --> 00:33:55.535]  I really believe freedom is a popular issue.
[00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:57.857]  I think the thing that's going to sink him, though, is going after the guns.
[00:33:57.877 --> 00:33:58.337]  Do you agree?
[00:33:59.298 --> 00:33:59.618]  Oh, yeah.
[00:33:59.718 --> 00:34:01.379]  The American people aren't going to give up the guns.
[00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:06.923]  Can you imagine now the millions of people who have bought gold coins and can't even find them now, realizing what's going on?
[00:34:07.383 --> 00:34:09.905]  They're not going to give up their guns and they're not going to give up their gold.
[00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:13.027]  They say this is an opportunity for the New World Order.
[00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:14.989]  In reality, it's an opportunity for freedom, isn't it?
[00:34:15.752 --> 00:34:16.352]  Absolutely.
[00:34:16.472 --> 00:34:17.773]  We should work hard.
[00:34:18.193 --> 00:34:19.494]  Congressman, God bless you.
[00:34:19.534 --> 00:34:20.154]  Godspeed.
[00:34:20.355 --> 00:34:21.255]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:26.378]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:34:26.418 --> 00:34:30.060]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:35.566]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:40.247]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:34:40.407 --> 00:34:43.168]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:34:43.368 --> 00:34:46.229]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:51.131]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:34:52.492 --> 00:34:55.455]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:34:55.735 --> 00:35:01.560]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship some audio that's safe from E. coli, salmonella... But I'm getting a network fee!
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.641]  ...or Chinese imports.
[00:35:02.741 --> 00:35:05.864]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:35:06.004 --> 00:35:07.465]  Call 1-800-409-5633... Yes, okay, fine.
[00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:08.126]  I'm excited.
[00:35:08.146 --> 00:35:09.047]  Can I take your number?
[00:35:10.968 --> 00:35:12.690]  Mr. Jones, can you hear me?
[00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.830]  Hello?
[00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.130]  Mr. Jones?
[00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.231]  Mr. Jones, can you hear me?
[00:35:14.251 --> 00:35:15.892]  I'm not going to let you do this.
[00:35:15.932 --> 00:35:16.592]  Okay, we can't do this.
[00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:17.193]  Can you hear me, sir?
[00:35:44.672 --> 00:35:45.933]  Uh, Russia Today, can you hear me?
[00:35:45.953 --> 00:35:48.713]  Okay, they hung up.
[00:35:49.394 --> 00:35:52.775]  I know we're live on air, that's why I wanted to do this transmission and get them on.
[00:35:54.035 --> 00:35:55.996]  That's why I wanted to work this out beforehand.
[00:35:58.676 --> 00:36:00.397]  John, play music until we're ready.
[00:36:19.209 --> 00:36:20.354]  No, I'm just going to take it on the phone.
[00:36:21.478 --> 00:36:21.578]  Okay?
[00:36:23.847 --> 00:36:24.128]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.941]  I think so.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.091]  We'll stay in.
[00:38:51.056 --> 00:38:53.338]  I don't know why.
[00:39:24.076 --> 00:39:25.557]  Yes, and aloha!
[00:39:25.577 --> 00:39:26.837]  Welcome to the show here today.
[00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:31.000]  This is... First of all, apologies, we've got all kinds of technical problems right now.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.282]  I think the mutant hamster in our little wire wheel that powers the board is starving right now.
[00:39:36.943 --> 00:39:45.447]  And this is the Alex Jones Show, and Alex is off doing his interview with Russia right now, and so I'm sitting in and grabbing the microphone.
[00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:47.508]  We're off to a very inauspicious start here.
[00:39:48.128 --> 00:39:53.091]  So, obviously if you've been watching the Barack Obama inauguration,
[00:39:54.318 --> 00:39:55.759]  It's quite a spectacle.
[00:39:55.799 --> 00:40:07.163]  They're definitely doing it up proud, as it were, and I'm watching the people's faces along the parade route as they do the pan camera along the people standing on the street, and just the look on their faces.
[00:40:07.743 --> 00:40:21.729]  They have so oversold Barack Obama as an agent of change in this country that I think if he's not able to walk on water real quick, there's going to be a lot of disappointment.
[00:40:22.395 --> 00:40:25.081]  Okay, the music indicates we're through the first break.
[00:40:25.101 --> 00:40:29.389]  We're going to try and get our electronic systems back to battery over this next break, and we'll be right back.
[00:40:44.221 --> 00:40:47.143]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:40:47.303 --> 00:40:52.547]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:58.191]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:40:58.531 --> 00:40:59.672]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:41:00.033 --> 00:41:08.899]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:10.960]  Now, compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[00:41:11.181 --> 00:41:15.344]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:41:15.384 --> 00:41:20.007]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.010]  Keep it natural.
[00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:33.434]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[00:41:44.038 --> 00:41:50.420]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.441]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:41:53.413 --> 00:41:54.434]  But who is the enemy?
[00:41:54.955 --> 00:41:55.455]  Bin Laden.
[00:41:55.776 --> 00:41:56.717]  This is his ammo.
[00:41:56.737 --> 00:41:58.059]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:41:58.079 --> 00:41:59.781]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:42:00.121 --> 00:42:06.889]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:07.710]  Some U.S.
[00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:13.397]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:42:14.097 --> 00:42:17.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:42:17.981 --> 00:42:27.849]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:28.830]  Fabled enemies.

[00:42:50.225 --> 00:42:51.486]  The time clock is ticking.
[00:42:52.146 --> 00:42:53.087]  Laws could change.
[00:42:53.467 --> 00:42:55.689]  The New World Order is advancing rapidly.
[00:42:56.209 --> 00:42:58.310]  Health consciousness is fading away.
[00:42:58.691 --> 00:43:03.854]  Junk food, fast food, fat food is the New World Order's game.
[00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.735]  Don't play the game!
[00:43:06.136 --> 00:43:12.440]  Slim down, detox, and cleanse yourself from the chemical foods and processed food that we intake daily.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.101]  And now for the holiday special.

[00:43:17.744 --> 00:43:18.284]  That's right.

[00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:22.707]  It won't last long.

[00:43:48.979 --> 00:43:53.164]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:43:53.825 --> 00:43:54.626]  You want answers?
[00:43:55.407 --> 00:43:56.348]  Well, so does he.
[00:43:56.368 --> 00:44:00.634]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:44:01.154 --> 00:44:05.199]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:44:06.312 --> 00:44:14.798]  Well, I'm afraid that this is live from Oahu, and this is Michael Rivero, and normally I guest host my own show, WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:44:15.318 --> 00:44:17.339]  Alex is out doing what Alex does best.
[00:44:17.399 --> 00:44:24.364]  He's out there shaking the world to its foundations and getting some new information that's going to be very important for all of us to be looking at as we head into 2009.
[00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:37.251]  Getting back to the Barack Obama inauguration, and it is, as I said before, it's a great spectacle, a Roman spectacle if you will, and it is a hard sell.
[00:44:37.331 --> 00:44:50.058]  They're really trying to get out the message that things are going to change, things are going to be better, and Barack Obama does have one very important advantage, and that is he is the successor to George W. Bush
[00:44:50.956 --> 00:45:15.082]  arguably the worst president in the history of the entire nation and so all Barack Obama has to do is absolutely nothing and he's still going to be seen as an improvement and the biggest challenge our country is facing right now is the economy and that obviously very firmly falls onto the shoulders of the preceding administration so Barack Obama is going to get a free pass on that
[00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:22.974]  He can either make it better and take credit for that or it's just going to continue to get worse and the preceding administration gets that.
[00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:25.119]  So Barack's got that advantage going for him.
[00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:36.031]  And maybe they should have been a little bit more muted on selling him as this savior of the nation, because now the expectation is very high.
[00:45:36.612 --> 00:45:48.744]  And as I was saying before the break, I mean, watching the faces of the people along the parade route when they were driving the cameras and everything by, it was like such ecstatic joy and religious fervor on their face.
[00:45:50.265 --> 00:45:55.286]  I'm almost ready for them to start handing the loaves and fishes to Barack so he can feed everybody their lunch today.
[00:45:56.407 --> 00:46:08.329]  Seriously, if he doesn't do something really spectacular, real quick, real positive, I think that expectation is going to come back to haunt him.
[00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:11.310]  Certainly, I know a lot of people here in the Alex Jones audience.
[00:46:13.248 --> 00:46:20.065]  uh... they were less than one hundred percent ecstatic about barack obama now uh... i wanted ron paul
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:31.845]  I was very disappointed when, as somebody who talked about real, significant change in the country, he was very quickly shown the door by the American media and the political establishment.
[00:46:32.685 --> 00:46:44.530]  So we were left with the choice of the lesser of two evils, and I'll be very honest, I was just delighted that Obama managed to keep Hillary out of the nomination, because I am still convinced
[00:46:45.490 --> 00:47:13.371]  that the original plan by those who shape our nation from behind the scenes was for john mccain to lose to hillary clinton and then when hillary lost to obama i think it took a lot of people by surprise and uh... but now he is the president for good batter indifferent he has a cabinet which really looks like a revival of the clinton administration for the most part we have hillary as the secretary of state
[00:47:14.463 --> 00:47:25.993]  And so, to be very honest, on the one hand, it may be that Barack Obama is already walled off to such an extent that, as a president, he may not be able to affect much change at all.
[00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:32.458]  On the other hand, and let's wait until we see what he's going to do, he may turn out to be another Lyndon Johnson.
[00:47:32.478 --> 00:47:36.822]  I've mentioned this before, but just recapping since yesterday was Martin Luther King Day.
[00:47:38.533 --> 00:47:51.517]  When Lyndon Johnson became president, and Dr. Martin Luther King started really uniting people in the cause of civil rights, it was Lyndon Johnson who stood up and said, OK, segregation is wrong.
[00:47:51.877 --> 00:47:53.778]  We are going to desegregate the schools.
[00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:57.879]  We are going to send the National Guard, if I have to, to see that this happens peacefully.
[00:47:58.899 --> 00:48:04.521]  And Dr. Martin Luther King, when he finally met President Johnson, said, you know, Mr. President, I am
[00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:12.064]  I'm grateful and gratified for your support in this cause, but it is such a contrast to some of your previous speeches.
[00:48:12.164 --> 00:48:16.666]  And Lyndon Johnson said, well, back then I was campaigning, and now I've got the job.
[00:48:17.786 --> 00:48:23.989]  And now that I've got the job, you know that old Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty I'm free at last.
[00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:33.633]  So, there's a possibility that Barack Obama, now that he's got the job, and if you think about it really, his political career,
[00:48:35.046 --> 00:49:00.527]  is over he's the president he's got one more election in four years and after that there's nothing left for him to do in terms of political ambition there's no way left for him to go he's got the job now he's going to do it he may prove to be very much like john kennedy and a lot of people make a lot of illusions between obama and kennedy kennedy was notorious once he got into office
[00:49:01.536 --> 00:49:16.164]  He basically abandoned a lot of his supporters in groups like organized crime to say, OK, I'm going to be the president of the United States and I'm going to do things I think are best for the nation as a whole.
[00:49:16.644 --> 00:49:18.605]  And that created a great deal of anger.
[00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:23.348]  But that was one of the reasons why John F. Kennedy was such a popular president.
[00:49:24.468 --> 00:49:25.429]  He was not perfect.
[00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:28.250]  He was not a saint by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:30.752]  If you remember the whole Marilyn Monroe thing, among others.
[00:49:31.878 --> 00:49:36.680]  But he did try and execute some changes, contrary to the wishes of his supporters.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.181]  We might see that from Barack Obama.
[00:49:39.741 --> 00:49:40.441]  We might not.
[00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:42.602]  Time alone will solve that mystery.
[00:49:42.762 --> 00:49:53.585]  And I know there's a lot of emails and a lot of calls and a lot of stuff going out there about saying, oh, Obama's just doing a terrible, terrible job, or he's going to be this, he's going to be that, and he's sold out to these interests.
[00:49:54.586 --> 00:49:57.247]  And it's all attempts at precognition.
[00:49:57.467 --> 00:49:58.187]  We don't really know.
[00:49:59.204 --> 00:50:01.406]  He's only just gotten the job a couple of hours ago.
[00:50:01.826 --> 00:50:03.247]  It's going to be all parties today.
[00:50:03.947 --> 00:50:07.990]  I think we just need to sort of sit and watch and see what the guy does.
[00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:17.197]  And he may turn out to really be thinking about the welfare of the whole country because in a lot of ways he really is an outsider to the political establishment.
[00:50:17.997 --> 00:50:25.823]  And he's a very smart individual and he may be smart enough to realize that if we don't take care of the country as a whole right now,
[00:50:26.854 --> 00:50:29.254]  That even the special interest people are going to suffer.
[00:50:30.615 --> 00:50:35.896]  And that is a wisdom that a lot of our economic leaders are very much lacking in.
[00:50:35.916 --> 00:50:37.736]  They go back to Adam Smith.
[00:50:38.276 --> 00:50:41.897]  They love his philosophy because it justifies a great deal of personal greed.
[00:50:41.917 --> 00:50:47.838]  And John Nash, of course, proved that Adam Smith was not accurate.
[00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:56.200]  That really wise leadership looks at the whole system along together with their self-interest in order to move society forward.
[00:50:57.185 --> 00:50:59.146]  But again, we don't know what he's going to do.
[00:50:59.946 --> 00:51:02.487]  He may be very sincere about wanting to do well for the country.
[00:51:02.547 --> 00:51:07.709]  He may just be another in a long line of presidential con artists that we have been suckered into supporting.
[00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:15.992]  I don't think he was the intended plan for president, but he is a professional politician, so we will see.
[00:51:16.552 --> 00:51:21.734]  Now obviously, as we get a little bit further into the show here, I want to go back and do a quick recap
[00:51:23.411 --> 00:51:48.992]  on this Israel and Gaza situation and by the way if you want to call into the show our number is 800-259-9231 same number that you call to get onto my show 800-259-9231 and when you call in and just say hi to our technicians who are doing yeoman service today apparently they're dealing with a lot of really really bad technical glitches today and uh... because of all that's going on
[00:51:49.632 --> 00:51:51.174]  We've only got a few minutes until the break here.
[00:52:08.203 --> 00:52:08.443]  A lot of
[00:52:28.846 --> 00:52:31.587]  Israel is still continuing occasional aerial bombardments.
[00:52:31.667 --> 00:52:37.109]  This may be unofficial, just from frustrated soldiers lobbying the last few phosphorus shells and whatnot.
[00:52:37.389 --> 00:52:42.852]  We are also hearing that the ground forces, Israel's ground forces, are in fact being withdrawn.
[00:52:43.372 --> 00:52:45.673]  This is not officially being acknowledged.
[00:52:45.813 --> 00:52:48.514]  Israel doesn't want to say, we're pulling out of Gaza.
[00:52:49.054 --> 00:52:51.576]  But apparently the ground forces are in fact leaving.
[00:52:51.616 --> 00:52:53.797]  So hopefully this situation is going to calm down.
[00:52:54.438 --> 00:53:04.304]  Thankfully, thankfully, because of people like you, who called your newspapers, called the radio shows, called your congressmen, talked to your friends, because of that huge public pressure.
[00:53:05.146 --> 00:53:12.695]  Israel was unable to expand the Gaza War into Lebanon or Syria or Jordan or, worst case, Iran.
[00:53:13.276 --> 00:53:21.946]  This latest attempt to create a regional war in the Mideast, possibly a precursor to World War III, got stopped in its tracks.
[00:53:23.092 --> 00:53:25.612]  And that was due to the public outcry.
[00:53:25.933 --> 00:53:29.773]  So, you are all peacemakers and congratulations.
[00:53:29.813 --> 00:53:32.554]  You can count coup on this one, definitely.
[00:53:33.094 --> 00:53:36.355]  Now, looking at the economy here, we got a couple more minutes before the break.
[00:53:36.395 --> 00:53:48.217]  I just wanted to note that apparently Wall Street is a little bit less enthusiastic about Barack Obama than some other people because the stock market, the Dow is down about 180 points right now.
[00:53:51.454 --> 00:53:56.996]  And I remember back when George Bush was sworn in, the stock market just had a field day.
[00:53:57.036 --> 00:54:04.658]  They just went way, way, way up into the stratosphere and everybody was cheering the economy is going to be wonderful and we're all going to be rich.
[00:54:04.778 --> 00:54:17.502]  And for a while it looked like it was working until we began to realize that almost all of the economic progress over the last few years has been creative bookkeeping, to put it politely, or pyramid schemes, to call it less politely.
[00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:20.713]  That did not bring new money into the system.
[00:54:20.773 --> 00:54:27.118]  It simply moved the debt around and concealed it and papered it over with more paper fiat currency.
[00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:34.065]  And this is probably the biggest single crisis that Barack Obama is inheriting from the previous administration.
[00:54:34.685 --> 00:54:43.573]  It's an economy that is in dire, dire trouble and no real easy quick solutions on the horizon that he can take advantage of.
[00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:58.611]  Biden and some other people were talking about having to make some very unpopular decisions and I think we know what some of those decisions might be and why in the long run I don't think they're going to be workable.
[00:54:59.591 --> 00:55:01.793]  So I want you to put on your thinking caps.
[00:55:01.853 --> 00:55:12.124]  I know we're all watching President Bush say goodbye and head on off to wherever he's going to head off to and Barack Obama's heading over to start his day on the job here.
[00:55:12.844 --> 00:55:22.274]  But he's facing a lot of challenges and I'd like to hear what your opinions about those challenges are as soon as we come back from this break for words from our sponsors.
[00:55:48.522 --> 00:55:51.305]  Are you one of the millions of people who make New Year's resolutions?
[00:55:51.565 --> 00:55:55.149]  Are you also one of the millions who wind up breaking those resolutions?
[00:55:55.389 --> 00:55:58.473]  How would you like to keep at least one of those resolutions this year?
[00:55:58.633 --> 00:56:01.596]  Well, right now, success is one click away.

[00:56:32.776 --> 00:56:33.777]  It is a big idea.
[00:56:33.797 --> 00:56:34.518]  A new world order.
[00:56:34.578 --> 00:56:35.018]  In the near future.
[00:56:50.425 --> 00:56:52.887]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:56:53.487 --> 00:56:55.268]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:58.550]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:01.572]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:57:02.292 --> 00:57:09.596]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:57:12.631 --> 00:57:17.614]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:57:18.075 --> 00:57:21.457]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:57:43.411 --> 00:57:44.391]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:49.252]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:57:49.412 --> 00:57:57.214]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:57:57.474 --> 00:58:02.855]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:58:03.055 --> 00:58:10.017]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:58:10.277 --> 00:58:10.818]  We're good to go!
[00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:35.165]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:58:35.505 --> 00:58:36.547]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:58:36.567 --> 00:58:36.768]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:58:43.402 --> 00:58:46.844]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:58:47.224 --> 00:58:53.648]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:58:54.308 --> 00:58:55.009]  Here is why.
[00:58:55.769 --> 00:59:05.695]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:59:06.215 --> 00:59:08.616]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:59:08.956 --> 00:59:11.037]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:59:11.077 --> 00:59:11.557]  this fall?
[00:59:12.058 --> 00:59:12.558]  Don't wait.

[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:56.941]  And here we are.
[00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:58.183]  Welcome back to the show here.
[00:59:58.223 --> 00:59:59.645]  I didn't even recognize the bump music.
[01:00:00.486 --> 01:00:07.778]  You know, there's an old saying that if you can't taste things that somebody don't say anything at all, and I guess they're following that dictum.
[01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:25.899]  Over at MSNBC, because I was watching during the coverage of President Pence's book, Former President Bush, thankfully, getting on the helicopter at Andrews Air Force Base, and the commentators are talking about whether hats are coming back into fashion for men or not.
[01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:32.700]  And I guess they are that desperate not to say anything negative about the worst president in the history of the country.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.181]  Now, a quick note before we go any further here.
[01:00:35.201 --> 01:00:44.145]  I've just been informed that Alex Jones will be rejoining the broadcast here and taking over brains here at the microphone at the bottom of the hour after this break.
[01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:49.687]  We'll be glad to have Alex back here and telling us what the latest is that he has got for us.
[01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:58.130]  Meanwhile, as I mentioned before we went to the splash break, the biggest challenge that the new president of the United States is facing is the economy.
[01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:24.490]  The biggest challenge Barack Obama is facing is the economy and it is one that does not have an easy fix and partly because the Federal Reserve has flooded the country with so much paper money to make up for
[01:01:26.033 --> 01:01:31.336]  The money that was owed before, that the whole system is really becoming very, very fragile.
[01:01:31.616 --> 01:01:34.337]  And here's, in a nutshell, where the problem comes from.
[01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:45.743]  When you have a debt-based economy, that is, when money is created, the instant people borrow it, then more money is always owed than actually in existence.
[01:01:46.944 --> 01:01:53.347]  And as long as you have a new generation, a larger generation of borrowers coming along,
[01:01:54.901 --> 01:01:59.984]  To borrow more money, to create more money, to pay money back to the people who were there first.
[01:02:00.924 --> 01:02:02.345]  It'll keep going.
[01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:04.326]  Functionally, it is a pyramid scheme.
[01:02:05.406 --> 01:02:12.750]  When you reach a point where there's no new borrowers at the bottom of this pyramid, that's when it starts to collapse.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.391]  So what the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
[01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:21.134]  government has been doing is they are borrowing on your behalf, without your permission.
[01:02:26.112 --> 01:02:41.679]  They are creating ostensibly to be repaid down the road by you and your children and your great-grandchildren, and they're borrowing that money on your behalf so that they can print out new money to give to the existing financial systems that are in trouble, the bailouts.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:50.063]  And the reason they're not really all that careful about where the money is being spent is because where it's being spent isn't the issue.
[01:02:50.463 --> 01:02:54.225]  It is simply creating new money to make up the shortfall
[01:02:55.296 --> 01:03:01.200]  To be able to pay the interest that has accumulated on the earlier loans, and stick you with the bills.
[01:03:01.461 --> 01:03:02.882]  And that's really it in a nutshell.
[01:03:03.302 --> 01:03:06.284]  So, what is the situation that Barack Obama is facing?
[01:03:07.845 --> 01:03:11.448]  Basically, new money must come into this country from some source.
[01:03:12.469 --> 01:03:17.132]  I know a lot of people are saying, abolish the Federal Reserve, I would agree with that, I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:03:17.773 --> 01:03:23.037]  Absent a complete collapse of the US government, which may happen, sooner or later it does happen, happen to the USSR.
[01:03:24.011 --> 01:03:27.534]  But until then, Barack Obama's got to bring new money into the U.S.
[01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:28.074]  economy.
[01:03:28.954 --> 01:03:40.483]  The way that you traditionally do that, short of conquering the rest of the world and having them send you tribute, is you've got to invest in creating new technology, new industry, and new products.
[01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:43.044]  We have lost our manufacturing.
[01:03:43.184 --> 01:03:44.365]  We can't play catch-up.
[01:03:45.706 --> 01:03:52.311]  We've got to invent new products that only the United States knows how to make, that the rest of the world wants to buy.
[01:03:53.504 --> 01:04:13.875]  Just by doing that, whether it's through a new space program expansion like we did in the 60s, or a Manhattan-type project for civilian science, or the way the Japanese do it with their tremendous funding for the fifth generation computer project, robotics, we need to create something that only the United States knows how to make and sell it to the rest of the world.
[01:04:14.035 --> 01:04:19.078]  Then money will come back into the country and we can pull our economy out of the doldrums.
[01:04:19.838 --> 01:04:23.466]  and that really is the only real way to make it happen.
[01:04:23.546 --> 01:04:28.095]  Everything else is just fancy bookkeeping, playing musical chairs with the debt.
[01:04:31.238 --> 01:04:35.763]  from the people with political influence onto the people who don't have political influence.
[01:04:35.823 --> 01:04:36.083]  Mike?
[01:04:37.184 --> 01:04:37.485]  Yes?
[01:04:38.225 --> 01:04:39.306]  Hey buddy, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:39.346 --> 01:04:40.788]  I appreciate you filling in.
[01:04:40.828 --> 01:04:43.010]  I want to keep you with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.552]  When we come back from break, I'm here now.
[01:04:44.572 --> 01:04:46.714]  I was in Russia today for about 10 minutes.
[01:04:46.754 --> 01:04:52.300]  I wanted to simulcast with him, but then we had a technical issue pumping it through my radio studio and I earlier
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.801]  Uh, going out over air.
[01:04:54.081 --> 01:04:56.042]  Uh, folks heard me getting a bit upset about that.
[01:04:56.062 --> 01:04:56.822]  I knew I was on air.
[01:04:56.842 --> 01:05:00.044]  I just want people to know that, uh, I want to thank the crew and the great job they're doing.
[01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:08.968]  It's amazingly stressful having Ron Paul on and then, uh, also having live Luke Radowsky feeds with video live of troops on the streets in D.C.
[01:05:09.008 --> 01:05:12.690]  and then tying you in via television and audio from Hawaii.
[01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:13.670]  I want to thank you, Mike.
[01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:14.731]  I want to thank all the listeners.
[01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:26.101]  We're going to have open phones, as Mike was saying, and get Mike's take on what we're seeing out of the Obama administration, now about an hour into being inaugurated, the 44th president.
[01:05:26.421 --> 01:05:29.744]  So that is coming up at PrisonPlanet.tv with the live streams.
[01:05:29.764 --> 01:05:33.127]  We are live there and on the AM and FM dial with the radio listeners.
[01:05:33.147 --> 01:05:33.547]  Stay with us.
[01:05:34.348 --> 01:05:35.229]  We're on the march.
[01:05:35.729 --> 01:05:37.331]  The empire's on the run.
[01:05:38.271 --> 01:05:40.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.645]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[01:05:50.005 --> 01:05:52.066]  Obviously, you have the perfect gift in mind.

[01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:40.972]  That's 702-453-7455.
[01:06:41.532 --> 01:06:50.434]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.455]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:53.433 --> 01:06:54.454]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:54.975 --> 01:06:55.475]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:55.775 --> 01:06:56.696]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:56.736 --> 01:06:58.058]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:58.138 --> 01:06:59.800]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:06.907]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:07:07.287 --> 01:07:07.728]  Some U.S.
[01:07:07.768 --> 01:07:13.414]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:17.617]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:07:17.637 --> 01:07:20.420]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:47.615]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:53.317]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:57.498]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:07:57.778 --> 01:08:00.058]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:08:00.238 --> 01:08:06.140]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:06.840]  We're good to go!
[01:08:35.476 --> 01:08:36.640]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.081]  That's 800-387-5516.
[01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:37.783]  Free shipping included.
[01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:50.077]  Mike Rivera with us.
[01:08:50.097 --> 01:08:52.398]  We're going to be on your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:52.458 --> 01:09:00.042]  Scott, David, Michael, Ronnie, Jason, and many others that are patiently holding the coronation of the 44th president.
[01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.363]  I've never seen the media get behind somebody like this.
[01:09:02.403 --> 01:09:10.168]  If you thought the god-like worship was bad before the election, and now after, it has turned into just absolute worship.
[01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:15.720]  They're closing Guantanamo, they're moving it to secret bases in the United States, ABC News.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:26.924]  They are going to have a new banker bailout, tens of trillions more, even more power, a new bank of the United States that's private, literally taking into receivership most of the major corporations and banks.
[01:09:27.504 --> 01:09:30.165]  This is like the oligarchs in Russia in the mid-1990s looting it.
[01:09:32.026 --> 01:09:32.847]  Same thing is happening.
[01:09:33.787 --> 01:09:35.868]  Of course, you know, George Bush had to be repudiated.
[01:09:35.988 --> 01:09:36.689]  We knew he was evil.
[01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:37.569]  We knew he was a puppet.
[01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:40.491]  But the same advisors, the same elites are behind Obama.
[01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:55.560]  Mike Rivero, I mean, they've now got not just the 18 to 24, three months a year service to begin with and paramilitary training, a civilian defense force, quote, as big and strong as the U.S.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.681]  military, a million strong.
[01:09:57.241 --> 01:09:59.943]  Now they've announced, and a few hundred thousand members in a week,
[01:10:01.172 --> 01:10:10.235]  Usaservice.org, a separate classical fascist organization controlled by Obama himself that plans to get millions of volunteers.
[01:10:10.295 --> 01:10:11.335]  Clinton tried this and it failed.
[01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:22.159]  He is succeeding because the media is acting like he's God and it has a lot of reasonable things like soup kitchens and, again, opening up to make it sound reasonable to get good people involved.
[01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:25.761]  And then they're admitting it's going to be environmental brigades.
[01:10:25.781 --> 01:10:32.626]  They're going to people all the other forces they're going to build in government out of that giant pool.
[01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:36.910]  I mean, this is classic body snatcher level tyranny.
[01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:38.771]  I mean, your analysis of that?
[01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:50.641]  Well, they... with all these celebrities that was on the net all day yesterday, and I put it on my website, and I paired it with one of the Lenny Riefenstahl propaganda videos from the...
[01:10:52.399 --> 01:11:04.568]  Mike, your connection from Hawaii is cutting out.
[01:11:04.588 --> 01:11:06.110]  We're going to go back to you in just a few minutes.
[01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:12.835]  Speaking of the devil, I sent the clip to the network out of habit, but we're doing most of the network operations here ourselves.
[01:11:15.293 --> 01:11:30.060]  Will you IM to my control room that particular first clip I sent you today, so we can put it up and play it here, where the celebrities say, we will do whatever you say, we will submit to you, we will do whatever you say.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.081]  Because that's what the media is saying in unison.
[01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:34.322]  Do what Obama says and he can fix it.
[01:11:34.482 --> 01:11:37.764]  But they never say what that is specifically, but in the fine print it's total tyranny.
[01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:40.745]  And, uh, they kept saying that in the speeches today.
[01:11:40.785 --> 01:11:48.788]  I was watching some of the speeches during the breaks and it was just, things will get better, they're going to get worse first, just do what we say, there's some things we're going to need you to do, this isn't going to be comfortable.
[01:11:49.048 --> 01:11:50.149]  I mean, this is scary!
[01:11:50.649 --> 01:11:51.629]  This is out of control.
[01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:52.410]  Do we have Mike back?
[01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.551]  Okay, testing, one, two, three, one, two, three, can you hear me?
[01:11:56.591 --> 01:11:58.572]  Okay, good, yeah, we've got you on air, sir.
[01:11:58.612 --> 01:12:04.935]  So, specifically, though, continue with this Hollywood video they're putting out, where they're saying, we will do whatever you say.
[01:12:04.975 --> 01:12:05.255]  Go ahead.
[01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:19.847]  Yeah, basically it's this video of all these celebrities that are standing up there saying, I pledge, I will do X, Y, Z. And over and over and over again, it's just hammering this whole point of pledging to support the president.
[01:12:19.927 --> 01:12:21.308]  I have no problem with volunteerism.
[01:12:21.328 --> 01:12:23.428]  My wife and I are involved in several charities here locally.
[01:12:23.808 --> 01:12:29.790]  But the problem with this is, that government trying to volunteer.
[01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:33.536]  Okay, Mike, again, we're going to have to cut it off there.
[01:12:33.997 --> 01:12:35.417]  Let's just totally reconnect with Mike.
[01:12:35.557 --> 01:12:36.158]  Okay, thank you.
[01:12:36.178 --> 01:12:39.419]  Again, we're audio and video, so there's a few problems from Hawaii.
[01:12:39.879 --> 01:12:49.684]  Yes, what he's saying is, they come out and in their real documents, and in some of their speeches they say, Force Youth Brigades, Environmental Corps, Senior Corps,
[01:12:50.964 --> 01:12:56.008]  18 to 24, you must serve in paramilitary training, Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama, all on record.
[01:12:56.189 --> 01:13:03.814]  Then separately, which is what Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin and Mao did, they create their own individual corps outside government that's the largest pool.
[01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:11.721]  And so to open up the salvo, they don't say, oh, it's to tattle on your neighbors, it's to spy, it's to go spy on farmers and ranchers and dig up dirt and try to steal their farms.
[01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:18.005]  That's what they're really setting up in the training that the federal government's been beta testing for decades, that we've been covering in my first films covering.
[01:13:19.224 --> 01:13:25.290]  And so then what they do is, they say, oh, it's soup kitchens, it's cleaning up the park, it's cleaning up the lake.
[01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:26.632]  And people go, man, that sounds reasonable.
[01:13:26.812 --> 01:13:28.433]  The government's asking for my help.
[01:13:28.854 --> 01:13:32.538]  Meanwhile, they're stealing trillions, setting up police state building camps, bringing troops in.
[01:13:33.752 --> 01:13:42.316]  So all that's going on, but it's this feel-good thing, and then Obama becomes the symbol of taking old ladies across the street, or taking old people, you know, to the store to get some food.
[01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:46.537]  You know, it's the same thing with local cops, where we take a family shopping for Christmas.
[01:13:46.658 --> 01:13:54.501]  The local cop means well, he thinks he's doing a good job, but it's PR for all the taserings and the shootings in the back and the checkpoints and the beatdowns.
[01:13:55.061 --> 01:14:13.988]  It's propaganda, making all of the charity, all of it about the government and about how good Barack Obama is, and then out of that giant pool that they launch in the name of helping old people and soup kitchens, they admit that they are going to people all of their governmental brigades and then separate fascist brigades.
[01:14:15.129 --> 01:14:22.872]  So absolutely, while we're getting a better connection to Hawaii from Mike Rivera, WhatReallyHappened.com, I just briefly want to tell the listeners something.
[01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:28.422]  I have had such a serious feeling of concern in my heart, my intellect, my soul.
[01:14:28.442 --> 01:14:35.747]  I have been so fired up and so focused that I haven't even been talking about really lately supporting this radio show and what we do here.
[01:14:37.407 --> 01:14:45.309]  And the costs are just absolutely huge to have three people in there running a live TV show and radio show.
[01:14:45.369 --> 01:14:46.489]  I have to pay those guys.
[01:14:46.909 --> 01:14:47.709]  They're great guys.
[01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:57.371]  To be trying to hire an extra web person and another IT person, who we're all interviewing right now, because we don't have the personnel.
[01:14:57.411 --> 01:15:03.453]  That's why InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are down maybe 30-40 minutes an hour a day off and on.
[01:15:03.553 --> 01:15:04.273]  It is a nightmare.
[01:15:05.382 --> 01:15:06.722]  Because we don't have the money.
[01:15:06.762 --> 01:15:14.404]  We have two CDNs and a couple other servers, and we don't have the money to get the new CDN, an extra one we need to fix these problems.
[01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:15.844]  We've hired consultants.
[01:15:16.765 --> 01:15:18.405]  This is all extremely expensive.
[01:15:18.445 --> 01:15:24.787]  We're getting millions of visits a day, but no one, the majority of them, the vast 99.9% are buying nothing.
[01:15:28.177 --> 01:15:31.419]  And I understand that's because the society is breaking down.
[01:15:31.519 --> 01:15:33.681]  I understand it's because the economy is in shambles.
[01:15:33.861 --> 01:15:42.187]  We are taking the gamble, the risk, under this maximum threat to the Republic and the attack on the Second Amendment and free speech and everything that's going to intensify under Obama.
[01:15:42.928 --> 01:15:43.808]  It's going to get worse!
[01:15:44.549 --> 01:15:50.073]  It would have gotten worse under McCain because they're just front men for the same agenda that rolls forward.
[01:15:51.403 --> 01:16:09.174]  We need your financial support, and the way I ask listeners to do that, plus you get great videos and books, is go to InfoWars.com and buy Endgame, buy Terrorist Storm, buy Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies, the books and videos, the Money Masters about who the banking elite are, Incredibly Reveting, all these books and materials.
[01:16:09.214 --> 01:16:19.981]  If you just go there and see it as a donation to liberty and freedom, we can continue, because things have gotten so bad across the board.
[01:16:21.047 --> 01:16:25.331]  That, you know, I made the decision a year and a half ago to get a bigger office and to move and expand.
[01:16:25.772 --> 01:16:31.898]  And looking at our finances then, it looked like that if it even held where it was, it was a big growth curve.
[01:16:32.807 --> 01:16:34.947]  And of course our listenership and viewership is way off the charts.
[01:16:34.967 --> 01:16:39.969]  It just continues to explode, but the amount of people that are able to support or buy books and videos is down.
[01:16:40.749 --> 01:16:43.749]  And so we need your financial support.
[01:16:43.789 --> 01:16:46.370]  We need those of you that have the capital to support us.
[01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:54.912]  We thank those that have supported us, because I made the decision a year and a half ago, but on top of doing radio every day, doing TV, doing films, infrastructure,
[01:16:56.133 --> 01:16:56.813]  I don't know.
[01:17:12.168 --> 01:17:31.195]  I'm trying to finish the other TV studio out there and I see the economy just plunging and every one of our capital centers plunging and I don't want to turn this into a giant infomercial with products and things that I believe in but still I want to cover the news so it's just better if people just support us and if you want to just write a donation to Alex Jones
[01:17:31.835 --> 01:17:36.662]  And mail it to 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:17:37.564 --> 01:17:39.827]  That will be spent on fighting the New World Order.
[01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:45.696]  And that will be spent on hiring more people and not just staying the same or getting smaller, but growing.
[01:17:46.601 --> 01:17:51.525]  We have a big nut to crack each month, and I just haven't spent enough time on this.
[01:17:51.545 --> 01:18:00.972]  So go to Infowars.com, go through the shopping cart, call the toll-free number, tell them what's a good combo, what's a good special, and get a great book, a great video, or if you've got the money, buy a hundred videos.
[01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:03.795]  We've got them as low as $5.95 if you buy a bunch of them in bulk.
[01:18:04.275 --> 01:18:05.436]  Buy them, give them to people.
[01:18:05.516 --> 01:18:07.337]  Or if you can only buy one, buy it and make copies.
[01:18:07.678 --> 01:18:10.060]  The key here to getting my films is getting them out to people.
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:19.587]  So that's how you donate, is you go to Infowars.com or you call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:19.807]  888-253-3139.
[01:18:20.047 --> 01:18:21.929]  I'll tell you what else this radio show does.
[01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:34.919]  We bring you all these other activists and leaders and scientists and researchers and authors and filmmakers who are not getting support and they respond that they get record support when they come on this show.
[01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:38.982]  So we're also energizing the activist community, energizing the Republic.
[01:18:40.017 --> 01:18:41.959]  I got an email last night, and I really know it's true.
[01:18:41.979 --> 01:18:44.321]  The guy said, Alex, you've got to get more on the NAS.
[01:18:44.481 --> 01:18:47.124]  They're taking over the food supply, the premises ID, the total takeover.
[01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:48.965]  You've got to get more on this Second Amendment attack.
[01:18:49.746 --> 01:18:52.349]  I know I cover it a little every day, but it's so big, it's so real.
[01:18:52.749 --> 01:18:56.753]  Alex, you're probably not only one of the big dogs in the fight, you're probably the only dog in the fight.
[01:18:57.825 --> 01:19:00.007]  And at this level, we're it, and we're not that big.
[01:19:00.307 --> 01:19:04.971]  We're the biggest, the best, the most focused, and it is rag-tag, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:05.471 --> 01:19:06.872]  It is rag-tag.
[01:19:07.933 --> 01:19:24.927]  And I talked to consultants and IT people, who are very expensive every hour, and they told us, you need these type of CDNs, you need this configuration, you need this package, you need these people, and we don't have the money to do it.
[01:19:26.081 --> 01:19:29.265]  I have limited reserves so we can operate in an emergency for a few months.
[01:19:29.905 --> 01:19:37.194]  So I can't commit those reserves to upgrade InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com so they'll be ten times more effective.
[01:19:38.235 --> 01:19:41.859]  And so, you know, five, six years ago, and we're going to go to Mike in a second.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.180]  We just got him back.
[01:19:44.222 --> 01:19:45.042]  Five, ten years ago,
[01:19:47.605 --> 01:19:48.506]  You know, I was small.
[01:19:48.586 --> 01:19:49.766]  Two or three people worked with me.
[01:19:50.066 --> 01:19:51.147]  I even did my own camera work.
[01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:51.968]  I didn't want to grow.
[01:19:52.028 --> 01:19:53.228]  I didn't like having employees.
[01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.249]  I don't like management.
[01:19:54.309 --> 01:19:55.790]  I don't like having to organize all this.
[01:19:56.330 --> 01:20:00.633]  It was enough to just do a radio show every day and make films, and have a little website that my wife and I updated.
[01:20:01.874 --> 01:20:02.614]  I grew from that.
[01:20:03.054 --> 01:20:05.476]  And then I had to learn to try to make money to pay the people.
[01:20:06.036 --> 01:20:12.080]  And then more and more, as we made more capital, I put it back in, and then things grew, and then the economy's imploding.
[01:20:13.798 --> 01:20:18.365]  So just to continue what we're doing at this level, we need massive support and to grow.
[01:20:18.565 --> 01:20:24.735]  If people want to donate, large sums, and I know people have them out there, it will 100% go to this operation.
[01:20:29.028 --> 01:20:30.730]  We need those donations.
[01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:31.991]  We need the support.
[01:20:32.331 --> 01:20:43.001]  And again, whether it's a $5 ball cap or a $15 or $10 video, go to InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139 or write us a check, send us FRNs.
[01:20:43.161 --> 01:20:53.731]  I don't care because I let the enemy intimidate me a decade ago, 12 years ago, that to never ask for money, to never get support, to almost be ashamed of selling my videos and saying make copies,
[01:20:54.352 --> 01:20:54.412]  Yes.
[01:21:24.572 --> 01:21:39.621]  I got people showing up saying I want to give you a $20,000 check and I say no no no no no or I get the check and then I have a $14,000 prize thing for videos about net neutrality to expose what's happening with the attack on the web instead of keeping that money to fund the operation.
[01:21:39.901 --> 01:21:42.722]  Well, I'm not ashamed of asking for money, and there's nothing wrong with it.
[01:21:42.922 --> 01:21:45.102]  The government's using our money to destroy us.
[01:21:45.562 --> 01:21:52.724]  They've stolen 8.5 trillion we know of, and yes, we need your support, because I realize how big this threat is, and I'm gonna bust my butt.
[01:21:52.984 --> 01:21:56.585]  I was up till 2 in the morning last night doing an almost hour-long audio blog.
[01:21:56.865 --> 01:21:57.825]  I'm gonna turn the heat up.
[01:21:57.845 --> 01:22:00.566]  I'm gonna do five-minute news blitzes on video every day.
[01:22:00.746 --> 01:22:01.966]  We're starting a bunch of new stuff.
[01:22:01.986 --> 01:22:06.327]  We're gonna announce the new month, and I'm just gonna gamble it all and gamble our reserves, and I don't care.
[01:22:06.367 --> 01:22:08.148]  I'm gonna go ahead and launch to the next level.
[01:22:08.368 --> 01:22:09.408]  I'm not letting it stop us.
[01:22:09.588 --> 01:22:13.089]  And I'm going to start that new national TV show, and we're going to do it all!
[01:22:13.509 --> 01:22:21.312]  And I'll run this son of a bitch in the ground if I have to, because I'm going to go 110% against these people, and I'm asking you for your help in this fight!
[01:22:21.452 --> 01:22:21.993]  I need it!
[01:22:22.353 --> 01:22:24.814]  And I am committed to this fight against the New World Order!
[01:22:25.014 --> 01:22:28.335]  And the dirty tricks and the attacks and everything we go under is so incredible!
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.621]  So again, it's good to ask for support, and I'm asking for your support.
[01:22:32.661 --> 01:22:34.281]  We've proven we fight like nobody else.
[01:22:34.321 --> 01:22:39.762]  We've proven with the resources, more bang for the buck than anything anybody could imagine because of you out there spreading the word.
[01:22:39.882 --> 01:22:40.962]  And that's how you can donate, too.
[01:22:41.362 --> 01:22:44.883]  Spread the word about InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.023]  If you had a membership to PrisonPlanet.tv, renew it.
[01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:50.384]  Spread the word about the free podcast every day, which ain't free for us.
[01:22:50.404 --> 01:22:54.464]  It's up to about $7,000 a month to serve it out to 125,000 people free a day.
[01:22:55.005 --> 01:22:56.005]  We need your support.
[01:22:56.025 --> 01:22:57.425]  Those people bitch about the commercials.
[01:22:57.645 --> 01:22:58.645]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:22:58.825 --> 01:23:00.106]  How am I supposed to fund this?
[01:23:00.306 --> 01:23:01.506]  How am I supposed to do this?
[01:23:01.706 --> 01:23:03.307]  How am I supposed to defend the Republic?
[01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:14.851]  All I want to do is cover the news and make films and fight these bastards instead of having to spend my time grubbing around for the Capitol to put the fuel in this Infowar tank's gas tank.
[01:23:15.171 --> 01:23:16.352]  I want to attack enemies.
[01:23:16.572 --> 01:23:17.492]  Give me the ammo.
[01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.572]  Give me the fuel.
[01:23:18.873 --> 01:23:19.353]  I will do it.
[01:23:19.373 --> 01:23:22.094]  And that's Federal Reserve notes while they've still got some value.
[01:23:23.234 --> 01:23:30.140]  So write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 if you want to support us that way as well.
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.021]  Alright, Mike Rivera, I just did a five minute rant.
[01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:37.005]  I just want to thank you for filling in today when I had to do the Russia Today situation.
[01:23:37.025 --> 01:23:38.546]  I want to thank my crew and everybody else.
[01:23:38.566 --> 01:23:40.548]  People should support WhatReallyHappened.com as well.
[01:23:41.428 --> 01:23:42.609]  I'm here ranting and raving.
[01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:50.294]  Because I realize how dire the straits are, and how serious all of this is, and I realize how many people we are reaching right now.
[01:23:50.394 --> 01:23:52.556]  It's huge, but it could go to the next level.
[01:23:52.616 --> 01:23:58.699]  We have a chance of winning this thing, and I realize my unique place in reaching millions of people, the incredible responsibility of it.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.501]  I mean, do you understand the angst I'm having here?
[01:24:02.202 --> 01:24:06.264]  Oh, I understand exactly what you're saying, and I feel the same way myself quite often.
[01:24:06.304 --> 01:24:08.465]  You know, it's very hard to be trying to do it.
[01:24:08.505 --> 01:24:10.307]  The big money is all behind the liars.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.204]  And the people who want to steal the country and propagandize into going along with the New World Order.
[01:24:16.804 --> 01:24:26.071]  And, you know, the only way we're going to get the big money out of politics is for the little money to all band together and support and focus on getting the truth out there.
[01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:28.773]  And so you've convinced me I'm going to send you a check this afternoon.
[01:24:30.535 --> 01:24:33.697]  I understand exactly where you're coming from, you know, and I hope the people listening
[01:24:34.105 --> 01:24:38.827]  We'll take the time to realize that, you know, this is not something that people do for free.
[01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.687]  It costs a lot of money to run this over here, what really happened.
[01:24:42.048 --> 01:24:44.348]  Most of our computers are pulled out of trash cans.
[01:24:44.388 --> 01:24:47.269]  That's how much on the edge we are to keep our system running.
[01:24:47.929 --> 01:24:49.370]  You know, people throw away a computer.
[01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:52.891]  We'll grab it and fix it and put it into the cluster to run what we're doing over here.
[01:24:52.911 --> 01:24:56.872]  Well, I mean, you work, you know, doing special effects, but you also do local commercials.
[01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:58.073]  I mean, you're working all the time.
[01:24:58.553 --> 01:25:00.833]  You've only got a few people you work with, mainly your family.
[01:25:02.774 --> 01:25:04.115]  Again, you need more support.
[01:25:04.175 --> 01:25:11.880]  You could do so much more if you had more support, but you know what computers and even cheap prosumer cameras cost.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.461]  You know what a light bill costs.
[01:25:13.761 --> 01:25:15.422]  You know what a server bill costs.
[01:25:15.982 --> 01:25:17.903]  You know what it's like to deal with all of this.
[01:25:18.424 --> 01:25:21.886]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, look, I know we can do big things.
[01:25:22.026 --> 01:25:23.667]  I know we're having a huge effect.
[01:25:23.767 --> 01:25:29.651]  That's why I'm getting past my allergy against asking for support, and I'm saying
[01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:30.911]  I'm wrong.
[01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:31.592]  I'm bad.
[01:25:31.652 --> 01:25:33.813]  I apologize for not asking for more support.
[01:25:35.193 --> 01:25:41.156]  Well, you do have to do that because, especially in this economy, people, you know, they don't have a lot of money.
[01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:51.620]  They need to realize that if they want this access to the truth, if they want to get this alternative view to what's coming off from the corporate media, they have to fund that corporation themselves.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.001]  And again, it gets back to the issue.
[01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:55.202]  The big money is all on the side of the liars.
[01:25:55.546 --> 01:25:57.607]  The little money has to stand up and be counted.
[01:25:57.868 --> 01:25:59.629]  And it's a dollar each, ten dollars each.
[01:25:59.889 --> 01:26:02.891]  I mean, you know, every little bit from everybody helps.
[01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:04.912]  You've got millions of people listening.
[01:26:05.253 --> 01:26:10.556]  If every listener sent in just one dollar, I mean, that would obviously fund you to that next level.
[01:26:10.816 --> 01:26:12.457]  We go way past the next level.
[01:26:12.518 --> 01:26:13.438]  I mean, that's the issue.
[01:26:14.119 --> 01:26:19.862]  Barack Obama and John McCain, the news report, spent two and a half billion dollars with all the PACs and the other groups.
[01:26:21.378 --> 01:26:24.560]  One dollar for liberty goes for like a million dollars of their money.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.640]  It's force multiplied.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.781]  This is the real resistance.
[01:26:27.041 --> 01:26:32.343]  That's why he's trying to create a fake grassroots movement to energize what he's doing, just like Bush tried it.
[01:26:32.884 --> 01:26:34.865]  And then I realize I'm the tip of the spear.
[01:26:34.885 --> 01:26:38.667]  I mean, Ron Paul on air said a year ago that half his donations were coming from this show.
[01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:40.908]  Well, what if I got those donations?
[01:26:40.968 --> 01:26:41.888]  What could we do?
[01:26:41.908 --> 01:26:43.209]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.421]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:26:46.561 --> 01:26:53.245]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:26:53.525 --> 01:27:01.690]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:07.633]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:27:07.813 --> 01:27:09.595]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:27:09.655 --> 01:27:11.818]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:27:11.838 --> 01:27:16.223]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:27:16.384 --> 01:27:18.486]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:27:18.586 --> 01:27:26.476]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:27:26.516 --> 01:27:26.956]  We're good.
[01:27:44.105 --> 01:27:46.148]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:27:46.268 --> 01:27:48.670]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:27:48.690 --> 01:27:50.913]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:27:50.953 --> 01:27:52.494]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:27:52.514 --> 01:27:54.156]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:27:54.256 --> 01:27:57.079]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.264]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:15.186]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:28:15.267 --> 01:28:16.368]  An inside job.
[01:28:19.062 --> 01:28:20.663]  How dare you?
[01:28:21.703 --> 01:28:26.545]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:28:26.565 --> 01:28:29.386]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:28:29.466 --> 01:28:35.888]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:43.551]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:28:44.632 --> 01:28:45.372]  The headlines are clear.
[01:28:46.414 --> 01:28:48.875]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:28:49.336 --> 01:28:51.897]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:28:52.557 --> 01:28:54.218]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:28:54.318 --> 01:28:57.480]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.181]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[01:29:00.381 --> 01:29:01.262]  To stay free.
[01:29:02.282 --> 01:29:05.704]  Now, Survivalist Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.

[01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:31.822]  Don't buy from copycats.
[01:29:32.022 --> 01:29:33.883]  Their fancy packaging is not free.

[01:29:36.083 --> 01:29:37.904]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:40.105]  That's SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:29:40.305 --> 01:29:42.286]  A long-term food solution.
[01:29:46.667 --> 01:29:53.770]  I promise we're going directly to your calls in the third and fourth hour today in T-minus six minutes.
[01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:56.651]  We're gonna continue to fight the New World Order.
[01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:59.052]  We are eastbound and down, loaded up and truckin'.
[01:30:00.578 --> 01:30:03.280]  And we're gonna do what they say can't be done, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:05.321 --> 01:30:06.742]  Crank this one part of the song up.
[01:30:07.223 --> 01:30:10.945]  So never mind them brakes, cause we got a run to make.
[01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:12.947]  The Texans are coming, baby!
[01:30:26.183 --> 01:30:28.104]  I'm shaking right now with energy, folks.
[01:30:28.285 --> 01:30:29.466]  I'm shaking!
[01:30:29.486 --> 01:30:31.227]  I never shake!
[01:30:31.467 --> 01:30:36.051]  Long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[01:30:37.372 --> 01:30:43.918]  Old Smokey's got his ears on, and he's hot on your trail, and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[01:30:44.478 --> 01:30:46.000]  We just got a FBI subpoena.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.623]  During the break, I get to deal with stuff like that around here.
[01:30:51.052 --> 01:30:52.393]  You know why we got an FBI subpoena?
[01:30:52.994 --> 01:31:04.806]  Because Ding Dongs on InfoWars.com went into the comment sections and gave out the cop that shot that guy in cold blood in the back's home address and said people should go after him.
[01:31:04.846 --> 01:31:06.367]  We don't get in trouble when that happens.
[01:31:07.188 --> 01:31:11.050]  The Secret Service and FBI just show up with subpoenas and get your IP address.
[01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.111]  So I hope you enjoy that, whoever did that.
[01:31:13.231 --> 01:31:15.572]  You know, we put those comment sections up for you.
[01:31:15.952 --> 01:31:17.093]  I didn't have them for years.
[01:31:17.153 --> 01:31:18.574]  People said, why can't we comment?
[01:31:19.034 --> 01:31:20.055]  Because of crap like that.
[01:31:20.635 --> 01:31:23.016]  But, you know, we're leaving it all up and it's your problem.
[01:31:23.536 --> 01:31:26.018]  It's your problem we just got subpoenaed by the FBI.
[01:31:27.058 --> 01:31:28.279]  What's that FBI agent's name?
[01:31:28.299 --> 01:31:29.419]  Come on in here, Mike Nelson.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:31.961]  Sam something?
[01:31:32.601 --> 01:31:35.102]  And then the subpoena comes through the fax machine.
[01:31:37.711 --> 01:31:38.672]  I'm eastbound.
[01:31:38.692 --> 01:31:40.933]  Oh, here's the best part.
[01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.935]  He's hot on your tail.
[01:31:45.536 --> 01:31:48.157]  And he ain't gonna arrest you, you're in jail.
[01:31:48.858 --> 01:31:50.039]  So you got to dodge him.
[01:31:50.079 --> 01:31:50.979]  You got to duck him.
[01:31:50.999 --> 01:31:53.381]  You got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[01:31:53.621 --> 01:31:56.162]  Get that hammer down and give me hell.
[01:31:57.063 --> 01:31:59.864]  Hey, uh, what's that FBI agent's name?
[01:32:00.885 --> 01:32:01.085]  Huh?
[01:32:01.405 --> 01:32:02.486]  Ben what?
[01:32:02.526 --> 01:32:03.126]  Sam Ben.
[01:32:06.547 --> 01:32:07.267]  Ben Sam!
[01:32:07.847 --> 01:32:08.508]  Ben Sam!
[01:32:08.528 --> 01:32:11.849]  It's Bound, Bandit Run!
[01:32:11.869 --> 01:32:14.990]  I'm going to keep Mike five minutes to the next hour if we can do it.
[01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.030]  I apologize for making him hold while I rant.
[01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:31.695]  But in one case with IP addresses with the Secret Service, it turned out the same person to try to burn us was posting comments saying go after, you know, whack Barack Obama.
[01:32:32.793 --> 01:32:36.374]  Gotta be careful even saying that, people edit that together on the web and have already done it to make it sound like I'm saying that.
[01:32:37.354 --> 01:32:43.315]  And then they would post on top of it, how dare you, I'm reporting you to police, that InfoWars is allowing this.
[01:32:43.335 --> 01:32:47.616]  And we don't have the personnel to go censor these comments, to go restrict these comments.
[01:32:47.656 --> 01:32:56.058]  We got a few keywords, like the N-word, or K-I-L-L, a politician, and then that screws up the servers.
[01:32:56.118 --> 01:32:57.858]  It's got to scan the comments before it posts it.
[01:32:57.878 --> 01:32:59.939]  But then when the FBI calls, we do have to
[01:33:01.141 --> 01:33:05.165]  You know, take the post down when we've been subpoenaed and do all of that.
[01:33:05.245 --> 01:33:06.406]  So thanks a lot.
[01:33:06.846 --> 01:33:15.775]  My guys were in here at 8 o'clock in the morning having to erase all those comments on every story about how go out and go after this bad cop's family.
[01:33:15.795 --> 01:33:16.836]  That's what they were saying.
[01:33:17.657 --> 01:33:22.761]  And then we're so busy around here, no one had even told me until I was presented with the subpoena.
[01:33:23.582 --> 01:33:26.142]  So, again, that's the fun going on around here.
[01:33:26.182 --> 01:33:30.603]  I need to be able to hire two or three people just to handle all the dirty tricks and things that go on here.
[01:33:31.143 --> 01:33:36.804]  Now, the person wasn't laughing last time who staged all that because they thought they were going to get us in trouble, and they got in trouble.
[01:33:37.104 --> 01:33:38.945]  Hey, let me explain something, dummies.
[01:33:39.345 --> 01:33:43.206]  When you write that, you are the ones that have the problems, not me!
[01:33:44.106 --> 01:33:49.047]  So, this is probably another dirty trick, and you are going to have the FBI come down on your butt.
[01:33:49.627 --> 01:33:50.687]  Mike Rivero, go ahead, sir.
[01:33:51.567 --> 01:33:52.367]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:52.387 --> 01:34:00.170]  A lot of dirty tricks going on, and we have to deal with the same thing ourselves, where we're having to take off members' posts.
[01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:06.573]  In our case, since you have to be a paid member to post, we have ID information on everybody, so it keeps some of the nonsense down.
[01:34:06.853 --> 01:34:13.176]  But yeah, Israel has openly admitted they're recruiting people to try and go out on the blogs and cause as much trouble as they can.
[01:34:13.336 --> 01:34:13.896]  So has the Pentagon.
[01:34:14.616 --> 01:34:17.617]  Yeah, and this may very well just be more of the same thing.
[01:34:17.677 --> 01:34:18.838]  And yeah, 60 FBI on them.
[01:34:19.525 --> 01:34:23.109]  Unfortunately, if it does track back to somebody in one of those government agencies... Stay there!
[01:34:23.129 --> 01:34:23.449]  Stay there!
[01:34:25.611 --> 01:34:28.995]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:35.584]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:34:35.704 --> 01:34:40.310]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:34:40.451 --> 01:34:43.194]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:34:43.394 --> 01:34:46.278]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:34:46.459 --> 01:34:51.165]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:52.326]  If you simply prepare.
[01:34:52.526 --> 01:34:55.467]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:34:55.748 --> 01:35:02.652]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:35:36.701 --> 01:35:38.622]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:35:39.102 --> 01:35:42.003]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:48.485 --> 01:35:49.126]  Big Brother.
[01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:50.846]  Mainstream media.
[01:35:51.547 --> 01:35:52.647]  Government cover-ups.
[01:35:53.307 --> 01:35:54.128]  You want answers?
[01:35:54.888 --> 01:35:55.868]  Well, so does he.
[01:35:56.448 --> 01:36:00.170]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:02.971]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:36:03.877 --> 01:36:04.698]  Alex Jones.
[01:36:05.599 --> 01:36:07.281]  Alright, into hour number three.
[01:36:07.341 --> 01:36:12.246]  Your phone calls, I promise, for all of you that are patiently holding, coming up in the next segment directly.
[01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:17.872]  Mike Rivera, I've been ranting and raving the last 30 minutes and you were finishing up a point you were making.
[01:36:20.347 --> 01:36:21.627]  About the things that are going on.
[01:36:22.308 --> 01:36:42.573]  But I want to go back to the question when your video feed was cutting out to us about how he's setting up domestic, separate from government brigades, but then they have governmental ad council ads saying join Barack Obama's service group, usaservice.org, and that it's the government promoting his own private group.
[01:36:42.593 --> 01:36:44.674]  I mean, is that not classic fascism?
[01:36:45.902 --> 01:37:01.474]  Well, it absolutely is, but more than that, it is simply a scam, because what they're trying to do is they're trying to transfer a lot of the functions of government onto volunteer groups who are going to feel really good and warm and fuzzy about doing all these wonderful things in their community, but it's not going to result in taxes going down.
[01:37:01.535 --> 01:37:05.157]  It simply means taxes are going to go toward paying off all these huge debts.
[01:37:05.498 --> 01:37:10.822]  The trillions of dollars worth of money that the Federal Reserve has been printing up and handing out over the last four months
[01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:17.553]  That's all going to fall on us, so our taxes are going to go up to pay for it all, but because the government can't afford to do any services anymore.
[01:37:17.593 --> 01:37:25.257]  They're just a collection agency for the bankers now, so they're trying to talk us into doing for ourselves all the things we pay government to do.
[01:37:25.738 --> 01:37:34.803]  And the bottom line is, if we're going to do all this stuff, if we're going to take care of the elderly, and we're going to go out and patch the roads, and we're going to go paint things and fix things ourselves, what do we even need a government for?
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.422]  Certainly not one that's taking more than half of everything that we earn.
[01:37:38.702 --> 01:37:41.303]  Mike, you hit the nail completely through the board there.
[01:37:41.443 --> 01:37:41.964]  That's it.
[01:37:42.064 --> 01:37:47.047]  They're saying, get ready for austerity, get ready to have to go out and do these functions for government.
[01:37:47.587 --> 01:37:53.290]  Meanwhile, all the money is going to go to pay debt to banks that we gave the money to begin with.
[01:37:54.751 --> 01:37:58.573]  That's absolutely correct, and basically it's the same old song and dance.
[01:37:58.833 --> 01:38:03.096]  Every government tells their people, you must make do with less so that we may have more.
[01:38:04.597 --> 01:38:05.197]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:05.837 --> 01:38:13.520]  I know you'd hope for the best with Obama, but I heard you on your own show here on Genesis Weeknights say that this is a real betrayal.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:26.304]  I mean, do you not feel sorry for those well-meaning people that were against war and torture and thought Obama would stop it, and now they're just looking up at him like little puppy dogs, looking up at their master, and he's planning to put them in a bag and throw them in the river?
[01:38:27.344 --> 01:38:33.990]  Well, as I was saying before you joined us on the air today, watching the faces of the people along the parade route, the expectation level is so high.
[01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:38.513]  If Barack Obama can't walk on water by the end of the week, there's going to be a huge disappointment.
[01:38:38.874 --> 01:38:40.275]  They have oversold him.
[01:38:40.555 --> 01:38:44.138]  They have oversold him, and he's got this huge expectation.
[01:38:44.398 --> 01:38:45.659]  And he's already got this advantage.
[01:38:45.699 --> 01:38:47.280]  He's the follow-on to George Bush.
[01:38:48.041 --> 01:38:51.004]  If he does absolutely nothing, he's still going to be seen as an improvement.
[01:38:51.324 --> 01:38:54.867]  But they've really raised the expectation level, and he's got to perform now.
[01:38:55.728 --> 01:39:08.913]  WhatReallyHappened.com, Mike Rivero, in closing, do you think, because they've introduced the bills to where the Attorney General gets dictatorial power, that's what they do, they pass a bill saying the Treasury and the private Fed can do whatever they want and can't be reviewed.
[01:39:09.473 --> 01:39:17.796]  This new law they're trying to pass, they've got a lot of co-sponsors already and the media isn't reporting on it, allows him to ban any guns he wants just by signing an order.
[01:39:18.536 --> 01:39:22.558]  And holders on record saying he supports the DC gun ban and Chicago gun ban.
[01:39:24.184 --> 01:39:26.645]  Well, obviously the power grab continues.
[01:39:26.745 --> 01:39:29.145]  I think it's very obvious that the U.S.
[01:39:29.185 --> 01:39:32.206]  government knows that they've pushed the American people to the edge of revolt.
[01:39:32.246 --> 01:39:34.727]  They're looking at all the rioting that's taking place across Europe.
[01:39:35.007 --> 01:39:37.028]  They're looking at the rioting that took place in Oakland.
[01:39:37.248 --> 01:39:41.129]  We're probably going to get more riots in California when the welfare checks stop next month.
[01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.149]  And the U.S.
[01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:49.311]  government is trying to figure out some way they can talk us all into agreeing to be completely helpless droogs in their grasp.
[01:39:49.824 --> 01:39:52.386]  Uh, you know, so that, uh, the government can sleep better at night.
[01:39:52.746 --> 01:39:53.066]  I agree.
[01:39:53.106 --> 01:39:58.851]  We have this Michelle Obama video and she goes, listen, things are about to get really tough, but we care about you.
[01:39:58.871 --> 01:40:00.051]  Just do what we say.
[01:40:00.071 --> 01:40:01.212]  I'm going to play that later.
[01:40:01.693 --> 01:40:04.454]  Just do what we say and things might be okay.
[01:40:04.515 --> 01:40:05.795]  It's going to be painful though.
[01:40:05.815 --> 01:40:08.297]  Meanwhile, we're having $150 million party today.
[01:40:08.317 --> 01:40:10.499]  Yeah.
[01:40:10.519 --> 01:40:15.222]  Well, I mean, no, it's going to take, yeah, the parties are definitely going to go on.
[01:40:15.262 --> 01:40:17.744]  We saw with the bailouts to AIG, they throw themselves a party.
[01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:23.536]  Every one of these corporations that gets another few billion dollars of the taxpayers' money, the first thing they do is throw themselves a holiday.
[01:40:24.477 --> 01:40:26.018]  Mike Rivera, amazing analysis.
[01:40:26.059 --> 01:40:27.720]  It's great having you be a big part of the show.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.521]  You're on every week now instead of once a month.
[01:40:29.842 --> 01:40:30.342]  God bless you.
[01:40:30.362 --> 01:40:31.123]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:40:31.883 --> 01:40:32.183]  All right.
[01:40:32.364 --> 01:40:33.044]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:40:33.284 --> 01:40:33.625]  You bet.
[01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:37.588]  More phone calls and news and analysis and some video clips straight ahead.
[01:40:37.648 --> 01:40:38.108]  Stay with us.
[01:40:38.829 --> 01:40:39.750]  Defense of the Republic!
[01:40:44.099 --> 01:40:47.141]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:50.884]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:40:51.364 --> 01:40:57.308]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:40:57.668 --> 01:41:01.811]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:41:02.311 --> 01:41:08.035]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:41:08.335 --> 01:41:11.317]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:41:14.039 --> 01:41:14.439]  I think so.
[01:41:44.275 --> 01:41:46.797]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:41:47.138 --> 01:41:48.419]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:41:48.699 --> 01:41:50.681]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:41:50.841 --> 01:41:52.622]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:41:52.742 --> 01:41:53.984]  The late, great USA.
[01:41:54.244 --> 01:41:55.645]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:41:56.005 --> 01:42:02.831]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:42:42.914 --> 01:42:45.898]  Hi, this is Steve Shane.
[01:42:50.322 --> 01:42:50.642]  We're good to go!
[01:43:16.542 --> 01:43:17.982]  Food is an everyday need.
[01:43:18.563 --> 01:43:23.684]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:26.205]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[01:43:27.585 --> 01:43:30.786]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:43:31.147 --> 01:43:33.847]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:43:33.887 --> 01:43:36.108]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:43:45.538 --> 01:43:51.564]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:43:52.164 --> 01:43:55.147]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:44:07.842 --> 01:44:21.629]  Okay, I'm going to go through a bunch of your phone calls and coming up I'm going to play these new PSAs that are running on TV, radio, everywhere with Obama, with all these pictures of great humanitarians and people giving in soup kitchens, getting you ready for this.
[01:44:22.349 --> 01:44:24.150]  Just like when they give people AIDS.
[01:44:24.850 --> 01:44:37.637]  In the vaccines, HIV, they then institutionalize it and make it all about red ribbons and everybody's part of it, or when all these kids are dying of cancer now from the shots and other things, they institutionalize that and make it all a fun thing, and you're part of a group now.
[01:44:38.197 --> 01:44:47.582]  I mean, it's so cold-blooded and sick, what they're doing, and Hooge is a director for local TV.
[01:44:48.343 --> 01:44:49.023]  Well, it's no secret.
[01:44:51.049 --> 01:44:52.570]  I work at a local TV news channel.
[01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:54.991]  Hooge, this is the American Dream.
[01:44:55.231 --> 01:44:59.072]  Remember that woman, I'm going to have her in here later, Paul Hartman, nicknamed Hooge.
[01:45:00.313 --> 01:45:01.333]  This is the American Dream.
[01:45:01.393 --> 01:45:02.254]  Is it okay if I talk about you?
[01:45:04.275 --> 01:45:09.157]  Remember that lady saying to George Bush, I work three jobs, and he said, oh, that's the American Dream.
[01:45:11.118 --> 01:45:24.781]  Well, the American Dream is being able to save enough money to live decent, to be able to innovate, to not have bureaucrats on your back, to be able to work one good job and have an upwardly mobile working class that can become middle class and grow the middle class and shrink the underclass.
[01:45:26.402 --> 01:45:29.182]  Hooge gets up at 2.30 every morning?
[01:45:30.743 --> 01:45:32.163]  2.30 every morning he gets into work at 3.30?
[01:45:32.203 --> 01:45:34.144]  3.30 at CBS here locally.
[01:45:37.435 --> 01:45:38.995]  And he's paid less than he's paid here.
[01:45:39.516 --> 01:45:40.836]  And he hasn't paid a lot here, folks.
[01:45:41.976 --> 01:45:43.357]  And then he works till 11.
[01:45:44.777 --> 01:45:45.997]  And then he doesn't have time to eat.
[01:45:46.017 --> 01:45:46.878]  He has to take a sack lunch.
[01:45:46.918 --> 01:45:48.238]  He eats while he drives over here.
[01:45:49.238 --> 01:45:50.059]  And then he works here till 5.
[01:45:50.119 --> 01:45:51.719]  Then he goes home to his wife and children.
[01:45:53.279 --> 01:45:53.860]  And how old are you?
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:53.860]  27?
[01:45:57.781 --> 01:46:01.262]  And he's a smart, great guy.
[01:46:01.282 --> 01:46:04.262]  Been working in radio and TV for a decade.
[01:46:05.103 --> 01:46:06.183]  At minimum wage, basically.
[01:46:08.769 --> 01:46:11.554]  I mean, he runs the CBS show in the morning.
[01:46:12.856 --> 01:46:16.523]  Now, that's an example of what we're talking about and where all of this is going.
[01:46:20.226 --> 01:46:23.249]  And Barack Obama says, get ready for the pain.
[01:46:23.349 --> 01:46:29.274]  And while he's there this morning, I said, hey, I want to run those new propaganda PSAs that the government and the people pay for.
[01:46:29.294 --> 01:46:35.600]  Because a lot of channels get partial money to air these, and then they get aired for free, because the FCC says you have to air a certain amount of these.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.080]  And what are they?
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.201]  Anti-gun commercials?
[01:46:37.561 --> 01:46:38.863]  Tattle on your neighbor commercials?
[01:46:38.983 --> 01:46:40.284]  Anti-marijuana commercials?
[01:46:40.584 --> 01:46:44.848]  To bolster the police state, so we can pay for people in prison, non-violent?
[01:46:46.769 --> 01:46:48.110]  All the government ships in the narcotics.
[01:46:48.650 --> 01:46:50.532]  And he said, yeah, I saw those PSAs this morning.
[01:46:50.792 --> 01:46:52.113]  They're airing everywhere.
[01:46:52.933 --> 01:47:00.379]  And it's a PSA, one of them, is a PSA to go join Barack Obama's private group.
[01:47:00.619 --> 01:47:03.361]  And he's going to have the forced government groups we've got to go serve in.
[01:47:03.982 --> 01:47:09.566]  But then the private group, and they're running TV and radio ads and print ads everywhere.
[01:47:10.967 --> 01:47:12.187]  It's all over television.
[01:47:12.227 --> 01:47:12.788]  You're seeing them.
[01:47:13.108 --> 01:47:14.009]  You're watching television.
[01:47:19.335 --> 01:47:22.236]  I mean, is this Nazi Germany?
[01:47:22.276 --> 01:47:23.057]  Is this the Twilight Zone?
[01:47:23.077 --> 01:47:27.179]  Do you understand what it means to have a private army, a private group?
[01:47:27.359 --> 01:47:28.999]  And again, to make it sound good, it's soup kitchens.
[01:47:29.059 --> 01:47:30.660]  And you read, it's tattletale squads and everything else.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:31.460]  They're getting everybody recruited.
[01:47:31.481 --> 01:47:32.641]  Oh, we're going to help the old people.
[01:47:32.661 --> 01:47:33.882]  We're going to have some soup kitchens.
[01:47:33.922 --> 01:47:34.562]  Come on in here.
[01:47:34.802 --> 01:47:35.362]  Come on in here.
[01:47:35.582 --> 01:47:36.063]  Come on in here.
[01:47:36.343 --> 01:47:37.263]  It's a government group.
[01:47:37.323 --> 01:47:37.823]  Come join it.
[01:47:37.843 --> 01:47:38.924]  And it's a private group.
[01:47:42.293 --> 01:47:43.674]  I mean, this is a nightmare.
[01:47:43.734 --> 01:47:46.236]  This is... It's like, well, you're against feeding the homeless.
[01:47:46.296 --> 01:47:47.256]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:47:47.276 --> 01:47:48.357]  It's youth brigades.
[01:47:48.417 --> 01:47:49.278]  It's tattletale squads.
[01:47:49.318 --> 01:47:50.158]  Read the fine print.
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:54.021]  And all these suckers going, well, he's good.
[01:47:54.061 --> 01:47:55.642]  He's inviting me and I'm part of the government now.
[01:47:55.662 --> 01:47:57.423]  And they're going to give people uniforms?
[01:47:58.684 --> 01:47:59.084]  What's next?
[01:47:59.264 --> 01:47:59.805]  Arm bands?
[01:48:00.265 --> 01:48:03.667]  They got 47,000 troops and police on the streets searching people?
[01:48:03.687 --> 01:48:05.008]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:48:06.809 --> 01:48:07.990]  I'm going to go quickly to each caller.
[01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.951]  Scott in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:09.311]  Go ahead.
[01:48:09.741 --> 01:48:12.582]  Yeah, hey Alex, I just wanted to have some positive points here.
[01:48:13.522 --> 01:48:21.666]  The Young Americans for Liberty are all over the nation distributing stuff against Obama.
[01:48:22.786 --> 01:48:26.067]  They have posters and other things.
[01:48:26.347 --> 01:48:28.648]  The true grassroots, not the false counterfeit.
[01:48:29.168 --> 01:48:29.388]  Right.
[01:48:30.309 --> 01:48:38.412]  And in a few months there's going to be a Continental Congress, which is sponsored by Bob Schultz and We The People Foundation.
[01:48:39.637 --> 01:48:41.238]  In Philadelphia.
[01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:47.583]  And they're having meetings all over the country now to get us back to the Constitution.
[01:48:48.164 --> 01:48:56.451]  And the system knows all these true grassroots groups are exploding, so they're forming their counterfeit citizen groups to go after us.
[01:48:57.071 --> 01:48:57.331]  Right.
[01:48:57.532 --> 01:49:01.175]  And then there's a gold money bill in Indiana that's in the state.
[01:49:02.179 --> 01:49:05.763]  And there are a few other states that are trying to get it passed as well.
[01:49:06.043 --> 01:49:06.463]  Absolutely.
[01:49:06.483 --> 01:49:08.725]  The elite know as they squeeze us that will form resistance.
[01:49:08.946 --> 01:49:10.327]  That's what NORTHCOM and the troops are for.
[01:49:10.347 --> 01:49:11.468]  They've admitted themselves.
[01:49:11.989 --> 01:49:17.454]  And so that's why us exploding our numbers to their unstoppable level is so key and I see it happening.
[01:49:17.974 --> 01:49:19.256]  I mean, I can't, you know, this week...
[01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:26.597]  Famous rock star called, and may come on the show, but is scared to, but wants to know what they can do.
[01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:33.802]  One of the founders of hip-hop called, and wants to come in the studio this week, but his manager, his Texas tour, he's not sure if he can, but he's going to be on the phone.
[01:49:35.823 --> 01:49:43.007]  I talked to, I can't say who I talked to, with one of the, let's just say it's been the top TV show on television.
[01:49:43.971 --> 01:49:45.572]  The entire cast are huge fans.
[01:49:45.592 --> 01:49:46.593]  They listen to the show.
[01:49:46.633 --> 01:49:47.413]  They watch the show.
[01:49:47.433 --> 01:49:48.895]  I mean, literally all the top stars.
[01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:49.915]  It's like wildfire.
[01:49:50.336 --> 01:49:53.558]  Then I talked to another big Hollywood star I know this weekend.
[01:49:54.378 --> 01:49:58.521]  They said that my material, my material alone, is just all over Hollywood.
[01:49:58.601 --> 01:49:59.502]  Everywhere they're freaking out.
[01:49:59.522 --> 01:50:00.603]  They're understanding what's happening.
[01:50:01.363 --> 01:50:02.144]  A large percentage.
[01:50:02.424 --> 01:50:05.566]  And then I talked to, well, I'm not going to get into it.
[01:50:05.626 --> 01:50:07.608]  And I'm not going, oh, I know these stars and people.
[01:50:07.688 --> 01:50:08.849]  I'm not contacting them.
[01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:10.590]  They're contacting me.
[01:50:10.610 --> 01:50:13.212]  Do you understand that?
[01:50:14.349 --> 01:50:18.171]  Understand that Willie Nelson just called my office, you understand, months ago.
[01:50:19.192 --> 01:50:22.193]  This is happening because they're out there waking up.
[01:50:22.514 --> 01:50:24.114]  They're out there seeing what's going on.
[01:50:24.555 --> 01:50:29.978]  Now, meanwhile, they're trying to counter with this new fake Hollywood thing for Obama, and these aren't bad people, they're useful idiots.
[01:50:30.298 --> 01:50:32.839]  They saw how bad Bush was, they're hoping there can be change.
[01:50:33.199 --> 01:50:38.062]  But they're going to know that we told them it was a fraud, and they're going to see the fraud quicker because we're there pointing it out.
[01:50:38.082 --> 01:50:38.422]  Go ahead.
[01:50:39.463 --> 01:50:42.645]  There are attempts like Georgia and Mumbai and everything else.
[01:50:45.074 --> 01:50:47.115]  I'm not ignoring you, they're playing a video over here.
[01:50:47.155 --> 01:50:48.836]  We're going to play this video later.
[01:50:48.996 --> 01:50:52.978]  It's one of these disgusting Obama things.
[01:50:52.998 --> 01:50:53.338]  Go ahead.
[01:50:53.699 --> 01:50:55.840]  Yeah, all their false flag attempts have failed.
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:01.203]  The Greek anarchists and the Gaza into Israel, all of that has failed.
[01:51:01.603 --> 01:51:07.346]  So, you know, I don't think that they're going to have a big backing for a new world war.
[01:51:07.406 --> 01:51:09.547]  It's going to have to be an economic war.
[01:51:09.787 --> 01:51:12.669]  But you heard Ron Paul in the first hour say they made stage something.
[01:51:13.447 --> 01:51:14.247]  Right.
[01:51:14.988 --> 01:51:19.670]  And I think the biggest tequila to heal for this administration is what they promised.
[01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:27.954]  Because that's what the young Americans for whatever they are trying to point out, is that he promised change, he promised reform.
[01:51:27.974 --> 01:51:31.896]  They have to shove that in their face and say, this is what you promised.
[01:51:32.576 --> 01:51:33.517]  Give us what you promised.
[01:51:34.337 --> 01:51:37.859]  We want peace and we want more jobs and more
[01:51:38.928 --> 01:51:40.349]  More money to us.
[01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:41.870]  We'll see.
[01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:47.354]  What they're doing is they're going to bankrupt the economy so bad where the only jobs will be government through a private corporation.
[01:51:47.394 --> 01:51:48.334]  I appreciate your call.
[01:51:48.415 --> 01:51:49.115]  Good to hear from you.
[01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:51.477]  Let's talk to David in Wisconsin.
[01:51:51.497 --> 01:51:54.639]  You're on the air, David, worldwide on the coronation of the Supreme Leader.
[01:51:55.759 --> 01:51:56.140]  Yeah.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:57.561]  Alex, how are you?
[01:51:58.021 --> 01:51:58.621]  Fired up.
[01:51:58.722 --> 01:51:59.682]  Born again hard.
[01:52:00.883 --> 01:52:01.964]  Hey, listen.
[01:52:01.984 --> 01:52:08.128]  Now, I originally called for Mike because he was trying to compare Obama to Lyndon Johnson and all that.
[01:52:08.556 --> 01:52:16.807]  Not knowing that Lyndon Johnson is complicit in JFK's murder and all that kind of stuff.
[01:52:17.508 --> 01:52:20.512]  The thing is, I'm going to send you something every month.
[01:52:20.853 --> 01:52:24.037]  Rededicate myself to doing something for your program.
[01:52:25.262 --> 01:52:31.063]  I came up with an idea that maybe you should have a product like Alex Jones Organics or something like that.
[01:52:31.363 --> 01:52:33.764]  I know, I just gotta try to organize that and get it.
[01:52:33.784 --> 01:52:41.965]  It's like coffee or something, you know, something that would sell for everybody and then have it just a little bit cheaper than regular organic, you know?
[01:52:42.606 --> 01:52:46.306]  And you, with your name alone, it would just go like crazy.
[01:52:47.306 --> 01:52:49.227]  Well, I mean, the problem is, I'm so, listen,
[01:52:50.111 --> 01:52:55.055]  I was up here till 11 o'clock last night working on the film, the Obama film.
[01:52:56.397 --> 01:52:57.618]  Banking film is really what it is.
[01:52:58.839 --> 01:53:00.340]  Police state film, but it's all about him.
[01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:01.981]  He's the thread.
[01:53:02.001 --> 01:53:03.383]  And I'm up whining.
[01:53:03.423 --> 01:53:04.443]  I mean, I couldn't go to sleep.
[01:53:04.724 --> 01:53:07.086]  And I got home and I did like a 30 minute audio blog.
[01:53:07.126 --> 01:53:09.448]  I didn't like it, so I did a 49 minute one.
[01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:14.052]  And my wife comes out on the back porch at 135 and she goes, what are you doing?
[01:53:15.336 --> 01:53:15.536]  Alex?
[01:53:15.556 --> 01:53:15.636]  Yes?
[01:53:42.916 --> 01:53:45.418]  I want to just encourage you to keep going.
[01:53:45.458 --> 01:53:53.743]  I know that you're not endless energy, but you are pretty darn endless energy, and your wit and your mind that God's given you.
[01:53:54.183 --> 01:53:59.606]  I'm just going to instill a blessing on you, and I know everybody that listens wants the same thing.
[01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.487]  So God bless you, Alex.
[01:54:02.008 --> 01:54:03.909]  I feel so much for you, okay?
[01:54:04.949 --> 01:54:05.490]  God bless you.
[01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:12.847]  And I want to say this, my grandmother, mother, great grandmother, she's not my great grandmother, I mean she's a great person, has been dead for about five years.
[01:54:15.638 --> 01:54:18.240]  She prays for me every day and she means it.
[01:54:19.601 --> 01:54:20.401]  And I can feel it.
[01:54:21.142 --> 01:54:23.303]  And I've had things happen in my life that are just incredible.
[01:54:23.503 --> 01:54:27.245]  And things happen by the miraculousness of God that I survived.
[01:54:27.486 --> 01:54:29.227]  And I know I've always had a mission.
[01:54:29.267 --> 01:54:30.447]  We all have a mission in life.
[01:54:31.308 --> 01:54:34.630]  And my grandmother's prayers are precious to me and I need them.
[01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:35.731]  And I need all your prayers.
[01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:36.992]  But you need prayers as well.
[01:54:37.912 --> 01:54:38.453]  And they're real.
[01:54:38.513 --> 01:54:39.233]  People can laugh at it.
[01:54:39.253 --> 01:54:40.674]  They can make jokes because they just don't know.
[01:54:41.775 --> 01:54:43.416]  And I just need the prayers because
[01:54:45.683 --> 01:54:59.153]  I'm not even afraid of them killing me or setting me up or destroying me in the media or something, which I know they've tried and planned and all the stuff we go through that we don't talk about that goes on behind the scenes are blessings to us because we know that it means we're hitting the enemy hard right between the eyes.
[01:55:01.314 --> 01:55:10.240]  But the only fear I've got is being killed or being imprisoned or being set up and not being able to continue the work I'm doing.
[01:55:10.921 --> 01:55:11.481]  That's my fear.
[01:55:12.482 --> 01:55:13.523]  For my children, for everybody.
[01:55:15.413 --> 01:55:22.815]  And I also have the fear that I'm not perfect and I'm not the best at this, but I'm the best there is, that at least has risen to prominence.
[01:55:23.795 --> 01:55:26.216]  And so I kick myself constantly, just how do I do more?
[01:55:26.256 --> 01:55:27.116]  How do I work smarter?
[01:55:27.156 --> 01:55:27.956]  How do I work better?
[01:55:28.016 --> 01:55:29.736]  How do I get things done?
[01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:35.798]  You know, I mean, we're here fighting with the air conditioners breaking and heaters breaking every day.
[01:55:35.818 --> 01:55:39.499]  You know, all the stuff you go through, and I'm like, man, I've got important work I need to do.
[01:55:40.404 --> 01:55:43.007]  We'll be right back with your phone calls straight ahead after this quick break.
[01:55:43.028 --> 01:55:43.408]  Stay with me.

[01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:46.905]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:56:47.326 --> 01:56:52.810]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:56:53.371 --> 01:56:53.871]  That's right.
[01:56:54.191 --> 01:56:56.453]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:56:57.847 --> 01:57:03.972]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:57:04.512 --> 01:57:12.198]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:57:12.638 --> 01:57:17.501]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:57:18.122 --> 01:57:21.164]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:57:23.925 --> 01:57:28.046]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:57:28.426 --> 01:57:30.627]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:57:31.287 --> 01:57:33.468]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:57:33.768 --> 01:57:34.468]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:57:35.888 --> 01:57:38.309]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:50.332]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:50.692 --> 01:57:52.393]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:53.345 --> 01:57:54.366]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:54.886 --> 01:57:55.386]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:55.686 --> 01:57:56.687]  This is his M.O.
[01:57:56.707 --> 01:57:57.987]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:58.027 --> 01:57:59.708]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:00.048 --> 01:58:06.812]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:07.192 --> 01:58:07.632]  Some U.S.
[01:58:07.672 --> 01:58:13.315]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:14.035 --> 01:58:17.516]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:17.536 --> 01:58:20.517]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:43.886 --> 01:58:45.086]  I am so frustrated.
[01:58:45.186 --> 01:58:47.327]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[01:58:47.527 --> 01:58:47.827]  What?
[01:58:48.107 --> 01:58:50.688]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[01:58:50.868 --> 01:58:52.128]  I read something and forget.
[01:58:52.288 --> 01:58:53.469]  I forget people's names.
[01:58:53.549 --> 01:58:57.190]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:58.970]  I... Okay, slow down.
[01:58:59.070 --> 01:59:01.511]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[01:59:01.631 --> 01:59:08.693]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[01:59:08.793 --> 01:59:10.233]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[01:59:10.413 --> 01:59:11.934]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[01:59:12.154 --> 01:59:13.074]  Even entire books.
[01:59:13.314 --> 01:59:13.514]  What?
[01:59:13.594 --> 01:59:13.894]  How?
[01:59:14.154 --> 01:59:17.355]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[01:59:17.415 --> 01:59:21.076]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[01:59:21.196 --> 01:59:30.458]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[01:59:30.818 --> 01:59:35.999]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[01:59:36.199 --> 01:59:36.519]  Wow.
[01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:37.479]  What's the website?
[01:59:37.739 --> 01:59:41.021]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[01:59:41.221 --> 01:59:43.302]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[01:59:50.406 --> 01:59:55.548]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[01:59:55.989 --> 02:00:01.311]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[02:00:01.491 --> 02:00:05.914]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[02:00:06.872 --> 02:00:10.536]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[02:00:12.277 --> 02:00:15.120]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:17.462]  I take my chances.
[02:00:17.962 --> 02:00:20.805]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:31.904]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leadin' ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[02:00:32.064 --> 02:00:39.708]  I might fall from a tall building... We are back live, going to your phone calls, analysis of the Obama abomination.
[02:00:41.209 --> 02:00:44.171]  Coming up, video clips, analysis, Russia Today.
[02:00:44.191 --> 02:00:45.351]  I'm gonna play that TV clip.
[02:00:46.052 --> 02:00:47.192]  Here we've got the clip.
[02:00:47.672 --> 02:00:52.695]  Went out live for about ten minutes and they edited it down for the web in a first a five-minute part and in a second, that's the way they do it.
[02:00:55.444 --> 02:00:58.427]  But let's go ahead and go back to your calls right now.
[02:00:59.808 --> 02:01:02.250]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:03.090]  Ronnie, go ahead.
[02:01:05.152 --> 02:01:05.692]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:05.793 --> 02:01:16.021]  Bless you and rejoice, Alex, because our very own, ongoing, ever-extrapolating OBGYN Dr. Ron Ball Revolution of Love for Liberty and our sacred, amendable Constitution just keeps on keeping on.
[02:01:16.101 --> 02:01:18.483]  And like you said earlier, CampaignForLiberty.com.
[02:01:19.144 --> 02:01:22.787]  And you can also rejoice, Alex, because the elite killing spree will fail.
[02:01:22.847 --> 02:01:24.428]  They cannot kill all of us farmers.
[02:01:24.943 --> 02:01:26.063]  Because everyone's got to eat!
[02:01:26.563 --> 02:01:33.025]  The elite can't grow enough food to feed themselves and stock animals, so they've got to stop their killing spree, just for their own sake.
[02:01:33.625 --> 02:01:43.687]  But, sadly, I say welcome to the United States of Israel, and servitude to that bigoted, socialistic, totalitarian, criminal regime, Israel.
[02:01:43.827 --> 02:01:51.609]  And because of Obama already just choosing that dual Israeli citizen, Israeli death forces veteran,
[02:01:52.054 --> 02:01:54.576]  Rahm Israel Emanuel is his chief of staff.
[02:01:54.616 --> 02:01:55.517]  I mean, that's a crime.
[02:01:56.297 --> 02:02:02.402]  And speaking of crimes, it's a crime that Bush's committed sentences.
[02:02:02.442 --> 02:02:04.863]  That's just a ploy to get approval from us patriots.
[02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:09.687]  But those hero border agents are still convicted criminals.
[02:02:09.867 --> 02:02:11.248]  Rahm was some company on.
[02:02:12.509 --> 02:02:13.510]  Yeah, right.
[02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:17.152]  They're convicted criminals now, with criminal records, and that's a crime.
[02:02:17.472 --> 02:02:19.834]  And they're beaten and tortured in jail, and nothing's done about it.
[02:02:20.274 --> 02:02:20.735]  That's right.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.621]  And can I squeeze in another revolutionary idea?
[02:02:24.442 --> 02:02:25.002]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[02:02:25.342 --> 02:02:25.542]  Okay.
[02:02:26.382 --> 02:02:29.344]  My feeling is that global warming is a good thing.
[02:02:30.865 --> 02:02:36.587]  Unfortunately, the global warming trend has ended, and the sun is now not putting off a lot of radiance.
[02:02:36.968 --> 02:02:45.872]  They've been studying it for 300 years, one of the first things scientifically studied properly, and it's totally cooled off with no solar flares now for about eight months, so it's serious issues.
[02:02:46.715 --> 02:02:53.578]  Well that's true, but in the meanwhile, global warming is the Monica Lewinsky of the environmental movement.
[02:02:53.598 --> 02:02:56.200]  In other words, to distract us with fluff.
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:58.381]  From all the real environmental crises.
[02:03:00.562 --> 02:03:01.923]  There are real environmental crises.
[02:03:02.043 --> 02:03:02.663]  Oh, that's right.
[02:03:02.803 --> 02:03:04.024]  And I disagree with you.
[02:03:04.064 --> 02:03:07.926]  I think human growth and population is a potential problem.
[02:03:09.218 --> 02:03:12.822]  In the meanwhile, water or melted ice is the basis of all life.
[02:03:12.942 --> 02:03:15.825]  Well, that's an oversimplification and I appreciate your call.
[02:03:16.886 --> 02:03:21.130]  Obviously, that's quite a load for the earth, 6.6 billion under current technological systems.
[02:03:21.751 --> 02:03:31.901]  Under the British Imperium Plan, the Royal Commission in 1949 stated they would not allow the third world to properly industrialize, knowing that that would actually
[02:03:32.702 --> 02:03:33.543]  I mean, the West is dying.
[02:03:54.201 --> 02:04:10.394]  They have 1.3 children in Japan, 1.3 children in Italy, 1.4 children in Germany, 1.3 children in Russia, indigenous by indigenous people here the last few hundred years, who aren't new immigrants to the United States and North America.
[02:04:10.414 --> 02:04:11.555]  We've got about a 1.7.
[02:04:11.715 --> 02:04:16.899]  That's for every two people who die, 1.7 is replaced.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.241]  So the West is dying.
[02:04:18.601 --> 02:04:20.743]  Industrialized nations, always numbers go down.
[02:04:21.659 --> 02:04:26.783]  It's the third world where this is all going on, and let's go to another call here.
[02:04:27.384 --> 02:04:29.285]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason.
[02:04:29.425 --> 02:04:30.126]  Jason just hung up.
[02:04:30.967 --> 02:04:34.569]  Abdul in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:36.511]  Thank you very much for this time, Alex.
[02:04:36.611 --> 02:04:42.676]  This is my first time on the show and I really appreciate it, and I'm a new member, just to state that fact.
[02:04:42.716 --> 02:04:44.577]  PrisonPlanet.tv, thank you for the support.
[02:04:45.278 --> 02:04:47.780]  Yes sir, and I just want to make a couple points.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.001]  First of all,
[02:04:49.758 --> 02:04:50.619]  We live and we die.
[02:04:50.919 --> 02:04:52.300]  Those two things are for certain.
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:59.385]  And the administration Obama is talking about has nothing to do with our progression as Americans or as human beings.
[02:05:01.006 --> 02:05:05.829]  The family and the values that are instilled in us as children have been missing
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.061]  For generations.
[02:05:07.281 --> 02:05:09.142]  And that's the real problem that we have here.
[02:05:09.302 --> 02:05:11.324]  And that's been engineered by the state by design.
[02:05:11.344 --> 02:05:11.964]  Stay there, Abdul.
[02:05:12.164 --> 02:05:13.225]  I'll come right back to you, okay?
[02:05:13.925 --> 02:05:14.106]  Sir.
[02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:15.306]  You're absolutely right.
[02:05:15.887 --> 02:05:34.200]  We have the textbooks, we have the government documents from John Taylor Gatto and Charlotte Isserby, the former head of policy, Department of Education, where by design, they have dumbed us down, broken up the family to make us more easily controlled, so the state becomes the mommy and daddy, and now that's what Barack Obama is going to do, bring us into the final phase of domestication.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.381]  We're on the march.
[02:05:35.841 --> 02:05:37.482]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:05:38.383 --> 02:05:41.125]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:44.427 --> 02:05:49.871]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:05:50.151 --> 02:05:51.432]  And we knew what to do.
[02:05:51.452 --> 02:05:53.233]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:05:53.453 --> 02:05:59.857]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:06:00.478 --> 02:06:03.760]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[02:06:04.184 --> 02:06:09.066]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:06:09.386 --> 02:06:16.190]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:19.531]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:24.894]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:06:25.434 --> 02:06:27.935]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:34.355]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:06:34.555 --> 02:06:37.097]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:06:37.478 --> 02:06:42.402]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:06:44.537 --> 02:06:59.481]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[02:07:00.021 --> 02:07:02.021]  Between now and January 20, 2009, all food units U1 through U2
[02:07:04.482 --> 02:07:04.782]  I think so.
[02:07:30.370 --> 02:07:30.610]  I think so.
[02:07:43.562 --> 02:07:46.823]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:07:47.003 --> 02:07:51.084]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:07:51.264 --> 02:08:02.687]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:08:02.907 --> 02:08:08.729]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:08:08.989 --> 02:08:09.610]  We're good to go.
[02:08:32.076 --> 02:08:32.936]  Front porch sittin'
[02:09:00.046 --> 02:09:25.632]  In an old rocking chair The sun is hot in the Texas sky Garden growing Clothes out on a line A dusty road when a car goes by Storytelling of days long ago
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:55.199]  And the only place she'd ever been Singing softly, this world is not my home And memories take me back again When I was young and Grandma wasn't home When she guided me as I watched life unfold
[02:10:07.822 --> 02:10:08.883]  Talking about family.
[02:10:10.985 --> 02:10:11.905]  It's under attack.
[02:10:12.366 --> 02:10:13.446]  Going back to your phone calls.
[02:10:13.506 --> 02:10:14.847]  Abdul, we were talking about family.
[02:10:14.867 --> 02:10:16.869]  There's Willie Nelson talking about it.
[02:10:17.949 --> 02:10:20.972]  The sacred institution of humanity under savage attack.
[02:10:24.994 --> 02:10:26.836]  Alright, go ahead and make your comments, sir.
[02:10:27.534 --> 02:10:28.575]  I just want to make a couple points.
[02:10:28.975 --> 02:10:35.360]  For one, I was blessed with a mother and father, well educated, raised me well.
[02:10:36.381 --> 02:10:39.803]  And one thing he would always say to me is, this is our world.
[02:10:39.943 --> 02:10:41.945]  Every human being, this is our world.
[02:10:42.585 --> 02:10:45.388]  And we have the right to seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.
[02:10:45.928 --> 02:10:48.950]  And that's the problem with every society.
[02:10:49.431 --> 02:10:50.932]  We've been so dumbed down by
[02:10:51.651 --> 02:10:56.412]  The public education that we have no knowledge of our true development of ourselves.
[02:10:56.792 --> 02:11:07.335]  Yeah, people are seeking after tennis shoes and cars and making that the penultimate goal in their life instead of the search for knowledge which will truly empower you, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:11:08.055 --> 02:11:08.515]  Absolutely.
[02:11:08.535 --> 02:11:10.556]  What do you think the secret societies are doing?
[02:11:10.576 --> 02:11:11.496]  What are they hiding?
[02:11:11.556 --> 02:11:13.777]  They're hiding the ultimate knowledge.
[02:11:14.257 --> 02:11:19.038]  And that's all a cult means is hidden and the occult is the system of controlling people.
[02:11:20.456 --> 02:11:23.437]  I just have one final question.
[02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:28.938]  You make great points, so you can interrupt me anytime.
[02:11:29.338 --> 02:11:34.039]  But I want to say to all our listeners out there, you must ask yourself, what do you truly fear?
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.160]  And what will you do to conquer those fears?
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:38.600]  That's what's most important.
[02:11:39.221 --> 02:11:40.101]  We live and we die.
[02:11:40.121 --> 02:11:40.961]  That's the bottom line.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.221]  What do you do in between living and dying is what's most important.
[02:11:44.441 --> 02:11:46.081]  Yeah, while you're wearing this earth suit.
[02:11:46.522 --> 02:11:49.863]  Well, and my greatest fear is not being in control of my own mind.
[02:11:49.903 --> 02:11:53.644]  My greatest fear is being fooled, being conned, being bamboozled.
[02:11:54.204 --> 02:11:55.424]  And then I get so sad.
[02:11:55.504 --> 02:11:59.345]  I got sad for Democrats when they worshipped Clinton knowing he was a New World Order and just a puppet.
[02:11:59.646 --> 02:12:10.629]  I got sad for Republicans who would support torture and evil and sign their souls onto this war that killed over a million plus Iraqis and millions before that with the sanctions in the first war.
[02:12:11.289 --> 02:12:27.695]  And I... And then now these poor Obama people, they're good folks, these poor white yuppies, these poor black folks, and just looking up to him and believing his lies when his whole agenda is evil and corruption and wicked and he smiles and he puts his nose up in the air worse than Queen Elizabeth.
[02:12:28.555 --> 02:12:32.396]  He just sits there, you know, today just arrogantly.
[02:12:32.416 --> 02:12:35.797]  I mean, just his whole demeanor and then he does that smile.
[02:12:35.817 --> 02:12:37.378]  I can't even do the fake smile, you know, that...
[02:12:38.223 --> 02:12:41.746]  That fake smile, the people, it's pure evil!
[02:12:43.627 --> 02:12:45.629]  And those who are aware can see right through it.
[02:12:45.729 --> 02:12:48.230]  I mean, I'm a black American Muslim, okay?
[02:12:48.871 --> 02:12:56.096]  And I can see right through his double speaking he does, and how he looks at people, how he talks down to people.
[02:12:56.437 --> 02:12:58.198]  And it's not right, it's sick and disgusting.
[02:12:58.618 --> 02:13:03.282]  And for the African American population out there that is listening, I mean, wake up, seriously.
[02:13:03.722 --> 02:13:07.605]  When has the American policy makers, the people who run this country,
[02:13:08.124 --> 02:13:12.870]  Ever let a black man be on top of something and do something for his people, quote unquote.
[02:13:13.511 --> 02:13:14.752]  Which he is not totally doing.
[02:13:14.772 --> 02:13:22.261]  Your last caller made an excellent point where Obama has sold out to the Zionists and called them basically his new master.
[02:13:23.457 --> 02:13:26.019]  When he put on the little thing that Jewish people wear.
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:27.881]  Nothing against Jews, nothing like that.
[02:13:29.222 --> 02:13:35.086]  We're talking about just like the elite of over every country, the corrupt elite over there.
[02:13:35.807 --> 02:13:36.927]  It's not just us saying that.
[02:13:37.067 --> 02:13:39.629]  Israel brags in the newspapers that we own Obama.
[02:13:40.630 --> 02:13:40.850]  Right.
[02:13:41.951 --> 02:13:42.171]  Right.
[02:13:42.291 --> 02:13:50.918]  It's just like when Bush was signing all these documents with a bunch of Kabbalists in the background taking pictures and smiling like you know he was doing the devil's work.
[02:13:51.325 --> 02:13:58.266]  Well, did you see a few months ago, right when Obama won, and they started talking about putting Rahm Emanuel in as chief of staff?
[02:13:58.587 --> 02:14:09.449]  Rahm Emanuel's dad, this former black op commander in Mossad, said, said, my son isn't going to be like a dirty Arab sweeping the floors at the White House.
[02:14:09.489 --> 02:14:10.489]  He's running things.
[02:14:11.029 --> 02:14:12.189]  Why attack the Arabs?
[02:14:12.249 --> 02:14:12.510]  Why?
[02:14:12.890 --> 02:14:14.110]  Again, I'm against a Nazi.
[02:14:15.491 --> 02:14:24.057]  You know, saying dirty black people, and I'm certainly against somebody saying dirty Jews, and I'm against somebody saying, you know, he's not some little nobody Arab.
[02:14:24.897 --> 02:14:25.118]  Right.
[02:14:25.538 --> 02:14:27.940]  And you know, that's the point.
[02:14:29.521 --> 02:14:37.086]  People, all this stuff, all this name calling, all the fighting in between the races and the religion, it's all a ploy.
[02:14:37.647 --> 02:14:39.468]  They laugh at this.
[02:14:39.628 --> 02:14:40.469]  This is what they want.
[02:14:40.902 --> 02:14:42.342]  They want blacks to fight with whites.
[02:14:42.402 --> 02:14:44.863]  They want Asians to fight with everybody else.
[02:14:44.883 --> 02:14:47.724]  They want Jews and Arabs to fight each other.
[02:14:47.944 --> 02:14:51.965]  And they always claim they're covering it to stop it, but they actually hype it all up.
[02:14:53.345 --> 02:14:53.845]  Absolutely.
[02:14:54.105 --> 02:14:54.705]  It's sick.
[02:14:54.806 --> 02:14:58.306]  It's totally and completely sick, and it's how they control us.
[02:14:58.346 --> 02:15:00.047]  In fact, John, cue up top ranking.
[02:15:00.067 --> 02:15:01.807]  I'm going to play part of that and then go to people's calls.
[02:15:02.207 --> 02:15:05.368]  Well, I hope, Abdul, you'll call more, and we appreciate you tuning in, sir.
[02:15:06.068 --> 02:15:06.909]  Thank you, and I shall.
[02:15:07.269 --> 02:15:08.269]  God bless you and take care.
[02:15:11.277 --> 02:15:12.838]  I mean, I've tried to not attack Israel.
[02:15:12.878 --> 02:15:14.539]  I've tried to not attack the people over there.
[02:15:14.959 --> 02:15:18.140]  Because, I mean, I got all these listeners over there that are good people and they know what's going on.
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:26.404]  It's so complex how the Zionists funded Hitler and wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany and made them pay million dollar equivalent bounties to the Zionists to get to Israel.
[02:15:26.424 --> 02:15:29.126]  They wouldn't let the Jews get out to New York or London.
[02:15:31.847 --> 02:15:33.288]  You know, it's so sophisticated.
[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:35.661]  It's so sophisticated.
[02:15:35.681 --> 02:15:41.945]  You know, it's not just Israel bad, you know, Palestinians good.
[02:15:42.506 --> 02:15:44.967]  It's very sophisticated.
[02:15:44.987 --> 02:15:54.534]  And I don't know how, I mean, intellectually studying it constantly, living, eating, breathing this, it's hard for me to even fully grasp all the nuances and how they manipulate it.
[02:15:54.554 --> 02:15:57.596]  But basically, the globalists always stage groups off against each other.
[02:15:57.997 --> 02:16:00.618]  They then control both groups because they control the central banking.
[02:16:00.658 --> 02:16:04.001]  They print and issue all the money in the world so they can buy everybody.
[02:16:06.434 --> 02:16:16.176]  And then, once they've got that in place, they abuse both the groups, or three groups that are fighting with each other, or four groups, and they play them all off against each other.
[02:16:21.317 --> 02:16:22.137]  It's just so sick.
[02:16:22.697 --> 02:16:23.658]  It's just sick.
[02:16:23.678 --> 02:16:27.318]  So I'm going to play a little bit of top ranking.
[02:16:27.338 --> 02:16:28.699]  They just want us fussing and fighting.
[02:16:28.719 --> 02:16:30.419]  They want us to keep on killing one another.
[02:16:31.547 --> 02:16:32.888]  We have to realize we're all God's children.
[02:16:32.908 --> 02:16:33.688]  We've got to come together.
[02:16:35.368 --> 02:16:42.331]  If the government was run by angels, as Thomas Jefferson said, and was run by God and was good, you could have socialism.
[02:16:42.691 --> 02:16:44.532]  We have unlimited production capacity.
[02:16:44.772 --> 02:16:47.313]  But there's always people who are going to want what somebody else has got.
[02:16:47.893 --> 02:16:58.043]  You know, in a communist society where the elites all live in palaces and the people are all enslaved in a, quote, worker's paradise, you know what the secret police always want in Nazi Germany or East Germany under the communist or Russia or China?
[02:16:58.323 --> 02:16:59.484]  They want your good-looking wife.
[02:16:59.544 --> 02:17:00.585]  Or they want your little business.
[02:17:00.826 --> 02:17:02.928]  Or they want, you know, the tiny plot of land you've got.
[02:17:05.128 --> 02:17:09.110]  You know, under the Communist, Lennon allowed, because everybody started starving to death, a tiny plot.
[02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:11.671]  They had to go work half the time in the government fields.
[02:17:11.971 --> 02:17:13.272]  They were allowed about a quarter acre.
[02:17:13.512 --> 02:17:17.834]  And those quarter acres were producing more than all the other food production in Russia.
[02:17:21.787 --> 02:17:28.175]  And the arts, the entertainment, the theater, movies, it was all controlled by the inner party.
[02:17:28.956 --> 02:17:32.941]  And then the starlets all had to have sex with the party members to be able to get the jobs.
[02:17:33.442 --> 02:17:36.125]  It's all about having your art, your liberty, all of it controlled.
[02:17:36.205 --> 02:17:37.267]  It's so dehumanizing.
[02:17:38.028 --> 02:17:40.230]  And so, if angels ran the state, it would be okay.
[02:17:41.357 --> 02:17:44.918]  But we have free will, so evil people are always going to get in control and use that.
[02:17:44.978 --> 02:18:00.243]  So you decentralize government, you have a culture educated in liberty and freedom, you defend the great jewel of liberty, you let none approach it, because government, as George Washington said, is a dangerous servant, like fire.
[02:18:00.804 --> 02:18:04.845]  Like fire, a dangerous servant, and a terrible, terrible master.
[02:18:06.534 --> 02:18:16.440]  And they are coming with everything, the social engineering, the regulation, the control, the attacks on the farms and ranches, the NAS, the premise society, just hundreds of attacks hitting us from all angles.
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.181]  They're coming!
[02:18:17.401 --> 02:18:20.223]  And they're bankrupting everything, so we gotta go to them and say, help us.
[02:18:20.343 --> 02:18:22.324]  And then they can pose and go, oh look, we help you.
[02:18:22.484 --> 02:18:25.726]  While they loot what's left of the middle class and transfer the wealth to the offshore bankers.
[02:18:26.727 --> 02:18:31.350]  Back to your calls in a moment, but we're gonna sit here and play top-ranking, or part of it, here it is, Bob Marley.
[02:18:35.811 --> 02:18:36.933]  We're good to go.
[02:19:12.421 --> 02:19:15.602]  And I saw them come.
[02:19:45.362 --> 02:19:46.543]  The brotherly love.
[02:19:48.283 --> 02:19:53.806]  Oh ho ho.
[02:19:54.326 --> 02:19:55.427]  In the ancient time.
[02:19:55.967 --> 02:20:00.649]  The brotherly love.
[02:20:01.229 --> 02:20:02.990]  The brotherly love.
[02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:04.791]  The sisterly love.
[02:20:04.831 --> 02:20:07.232]  The sisterly love.
[02:20:07.352 --> 02:20:08.933]  I feel this morning.
[02:20:09.753 --> 02:20:12.334]  I don't care being killed, being imprisoned, being tortured.
[02:20:12.394 --> 02:20:13.335]  It's probably gonna happen.
[02:20:14.633 --> 02:20:15.313]  I don't feel it!
[02:20:15.333 --> 02:20:17.174]  I don't feel it!
[02:20:17.254 --> 02:20:18.974]  I don't feel it!
[02:20:19.074 --> 02:20:19.854]  I don't feel it!
[02:20:19.954 --> 02:20:21.594]  I don't feel it!
[02:20:21.674 --> 02:20:25.495]  I don't feel it!
[02:20:46.308 --> 02:20:54.373]  Did you mean what you said about me?
[02:20:54.453 --> 02:20:56.314]  Did I mean what I said about you?
[02:21:12.572 --> 02:21:16.575]  And we all want to live together as brothers and sisters, and the enemy knows that.
[02:21:18.337 --> 02:21:20.358]  And so they create a counterfeit of that.
[02:21:20.899 --> 02:21:22.840]  This fake brotherly love.
[02:21:23.621 --> 02:21:25.242]  The sisterly love.
[02:21:26.423 --> 02:21:27.544]  That's what they're doing right now.
[02:21:28.245 --> 02:21:33.489]  Whites, feeling good, voting for Obama, thinking they showed they don't dislike black people, that they want to live in peace.
[02:21:33.509 --> 02:21:38.593]  You know, I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and I didn't hear anybody growing up who was white talk bad about the black kids in school.
[02:21:40.589 --> 02:21:44.253]  When I go deer hunting with a bunch of rednecks, I never heard talk bad about black people.
[02:21:45.635 --> 02:21:47.798]  Strangely enough, when I've gone to New York City, I hear it.
[02:21:51.343 --> 02:21:53.324]  But then later in life, I did hear those things.
[02:21:53.364 --> 02:21:56.325]  But the point is, is that it's a counterfeit.
[02:21:56.365 --> 02:21:59.186]  The enemy creates a counterfeit of our bank, our central bank.
[02:21:59.466 --> 02:22:05.288]  They create a counterfeit of race relations, which is really meant to go, oh, we didn't get along, look, we tried to get along and it all fell apart.
[02:22:05.308 --> 02:22:10.110]  Or, oh, get behind Obama, show, and see, that's what this is all about, is this fake brotherly love.
[02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:16.552]  This, oh, look, we can all come together, we can do what he says, and he'll fix it, and he'll stop what the evil white man George Bush did.
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:23.501]  They create counterfeits of everything good and decent.
[02:22:24.782 --> 02:22:26.342]  But they always centralize power.
[02:22:26.362 --> 02:22:27.683]  They always bring in the banksters.
[02:22:28.463 --> 02:22:30.024]  They always militarize the police.
[02:22:30.044 --> 02:22:31.685]  They always want to put the military on the streets.
[02:22:32.105 --> 02:22:35.166]  Obama's doing everything Bush did, but now Bush is stalled.
[02:22:36.345 --> 02:22:37.666]  He'd stalled because of resistance.
[02:22:37.686 --> 02:22:38.646]  He couldn't move forward anymore.
[02:22:38.986 --> 02:22:43.968]  Now Obama, like the flash, is going straight ahead carrying that ball for a touchdown.
[02:22:44.168 --> 02:22:45.809]  The new old order said, hey, give him the ball.
[02:22:46.249 --> 02:22:46.729]  Boom.
[02:22:46.769 --> 02:22:47.510]  Tiger Woods.
[02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:48.830]  Knock it out.
[02:22:49.050 --> 02:22:50.051]  Hole in one, Tiger.
[02:22:53.292 --> 02:22:54.413]  He's their Michael Jordan.
[02:22:55.093 --> 02:22:56.394]  And the crowd's cheering.
[02:22:56.414 --> 02:22:57.014]  Man, look at him.
[02:22:57.034 --> 02:22:59.315]  Boy, he is really going to take care of us.
[02:22:59.335 --> 02:23:01.916]  And then you read the fine print and it's hell on earth.
[02:23:05.854 --> 02:23:10.498]  Next, I'm going to play all these audio and video clips rushing today, the analysis of Obama and your calls.
[02:23:10.538 --> 02:23:11.679]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:15.782]  Let's talk to Craig in Philly.
[02:23:15.842 --> 02:23:16.863]  We Are Change.
[02:23:16.943 --> 02:23:17.684]  Welcome, Craig.
[02:23:19.345 --> 02:23:20.546]  Hey, what's up, Mr. Jones?
[02:23:20.927 --> 02:23:22.428]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:23:23.409 --> 02:23:26.351]  Yeah, I'm actually just calling in to put the word out.
[02:23:26.611 --> 02:23:30.995]  Philadelphia, We Are Change is just getting off the ground, and we are in desperate need of people.
[02:23:31.893 --> 02:23:34.538]  We have a couple, but a couple is not enough.
[02:23:34.838 --> 02:23:37.342]  Give us the website or an email.
[02:23:37.422 --> 02:23:41.629]  PhiladelphiaWeAreChanged.org and I can be contacted directly.
[02:23:42.179 --> 02:23:48.084]  At Craig Motika, C-R-A-I-G-M-O-T-Y-K-A, at PhiladelphiaWeAreChanged.org.
[02:23:48.544 --> 02:23:48.925]  Excellent.
[02:23:49.505 --> 02:23:50.666]  Hope folks enjoyin' the battle.
[02:23:50.966 --> 02:23:52.748]  What do you think of the puppet Obama?
[02:23:52.768 --> 02:23:58.893]  We've gained so much against the police, state, torture, and war, but now the liberals are like, forget torture, forget the war, forget the Patriot Act.
[02:23:59.293 --> 02:24:00.154]  Look, he's black!
[02:24:00.214 --> 02:24:01.475]  It means everything's changed!
[02:24:02.756 --> 02:24:09.221]  Well, uh, we shall see, but we're hopin' for the best, but we're probably gonna be duped, as you, uh... Well, there's no probably.
[02:24:09.241 --> 02:24:10.863]  Look what he's already denounced he's gonna do.
[02:24:11.852 --> 02:24:12.353]  Yeah, true.
[02:24:13.334 --> 02:24:16.497]  Also, I did want to bring up a website called grassfire.org.
[02:24:17.177 --> 02:24:20.901]  It's an Obama resistance grouping website type thing.
[02:24:21.241 --> 02:24:22.002]  What's it called?
[02:24:22.823 --> 02:24:23.123]  What's that?
[02:24:23.704 --> 02:24:24.484]  What's it called again?
[02:24:25.345 --> 02:24:26.646]  grassfire.org.
[02:24:26.847 --> 02:24:27.747]  Oh yes, grassfire.org.
[02:24:27.767 --> 02:24:28.508]  Appreciate your call.
[02:24:28.548 --> 02:24:29.149]  Good to hear from you.
[02:24:29.689 --> 02:24:31.551]  Let's talk to Mark in Oregon.
[02:24:31.651 --> 02:24:33.173]  Mark, you're on the air globally.
[02:24:34.724 --> 02:24:36.565]  Hey, good day to you, Alex.
[02:24:36.805 --> 02:24:37.685]  Good day to you, my brother.
[02:24:38.206 --> 02:24:38.766]  Thank you, sir.
[02:24:39.206 --> 02:24:46.410]  Alex, I called you last week and I restrained myself, I believe, so far successfully 100% in calling the show more than once a week.
[02:24:46.450 --> 02:24:51.132]  I want to give other people a chance to air their views and their information.
[02:24:51.192 --> 02:24:51.792]  It's your time.
[02:24:51.812 --> 02:24:52.592]  You're on the air, brother.
[02:24:52.612 --> 02:24:53.033]  Go ahead.
[02:24:53.733 --> 02:25:00.016]  But I thought it was so important to call today after I heard your plea for finances just a few minutes ago.
[02:25:00.618 --> 02:25:11.448]  Really touched me, and what I suggested last week is just basically what I suggested today, Alex, and that is they're upping the ante very quickly with this new president today.
[02:25:11.488 --> 02:25:23.500]  This administration is going to move ahead at the Blitzkrieg speed that you're aware of, and to stay in the game with them, to be any competition at all, you're going to have to have the financing.
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:24.681]  You're speaking for us all.
[02:25:25.157 --> 02:25:29.079]  We're all happy to donate to you, Alex, because we're donating to our own welfare.
[02:25:29.099 --> 02:25:30.220]  You're out there for us.
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:33.662]  Well, I'm just going to be honest with people, and I'm going to hold you over, and put him on hold.
[02:25:33.702 --> 02:25:37.845]  I wasn't going to tell this story, but I'm going to briefly tell it and leave it at that, because I don't like our enemies having victories.
[02:25:38.165 --> 02:25:40.626]  But because they did this, I'm going to do another money bomb in the future.
[02:25:41.207 --> 02:25:44.328]  Because they did this, I'm just going to go ahead and start asking for donations.
[02:25:45.969 --> 02:25:49.251]  I just wanted to get, it was the office's idea, a few thousand dollars for the Bullhorn.
[02:25:50.092 --> 02:25:53.394]  It was actually Aaron's idea, and then Mike seconded it.
[02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.869]  We put it up.
[02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:57.450]  We got real bids up to about 20 grand.
[02:25:58.151 --> 02:26:01.352]  The anti-911 truth groups openly bragged they were putting in fake bids.
[02:26:01.492 --> 02:26:03.333]  Later after the bids went through, we saw they were fake.
[02:26:05.434 --> 02:26:10.336]  They put in scores of fake bids, and so the bullhorn did not go for $50,000.
[02:26:10.816 --> 02:26:13.438]  They criminally, and eBay says they're doing criminal filings.
[02:26:14.421 --> 02:26:18.503]  Yes, we have to wait as we go down each bid, all these fake bids to find the real bids.
[02:26:18.543 --> 02:26:19.884]  We probably won't even be able to sell that.
[02:26:20.324 --> 02:26:20.904]  But it won't matter.
[02:26:20.944 --> 02:26:21.985]  We have toll-free lines.
[02:26:22.045 --> 02:26:22.825]  We have products.
[02:26:23.185 --> 02:26:27.647]  People can still support us, even though... And they said, you son of a bitch, Alex.
[02:26:28.048 --> 02:26:28.868]  Some of them even called here.
[02:26:28.888 --> 02:26:31.829]  They said, you're not going to sell that bullhorn ever, and you're not going to get money.
[02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:35.331]  And they said, we're going to pull the stops out with dirty tricks against you.
[02:26:35.671 --> 02:26:36.311]  Well, you know what?
[02:26:37.412 --> 02:26:41.574]  The people are going to stop you, and we're just going to go ahead and fundraise off of what you did.
[02:26:44.013 --> 02:26:52.102]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[02:26:52.263 --> 02:26:56.668]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[02:26:56.828 --> 02:27:01.353]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[02:27:01.513 --> 02:27:02.935]  It's a documented fact.
[02:27:03.776 --> 02:27:10.382]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[02:27:10.542 --> 02:27:22.393]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[02:27:22.653 --> 02:27:26.317]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.

[02:27:42.525 --> 02:27:50.489]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:27:50.849 --> 02:27:52.570]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:27:53.484 --> 02:27:54.525]  But who is the enemy?
[02:27:55.025 --> 02:27:55.526]  Bin Laden.
[02:27:55.826 --> 02:27:56.827]  This is his M.O.
[02:27:56.847 --> 02:27:58.147]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:27:58.188 --> 02:27:59.849]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:28:00.189 --> 02:28:06.934]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:28:07.334 --> 02:28:07.775]  Some U.S.
[02:28:07.815 --> 02:28:13.499]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:28:14.159 --> 02:28:17.680]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:27.903]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:28:28.143 --> 02:28:28.883]  Fabled enemies.

[02:29:37.058 --> 02:29:37.359]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[02:29:37.419 --> 02:29:38.620]  I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion.
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:39.320]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:40.161]  We're gonna ride.
[02:29:40.181 --> 02:29:41.582]  I'm gonna chase the sky forever.
[02:30:08.439 --> 02:30:23.926]  And the sun... And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder... Before we ever come this way again... Before we ever pass... Are you gonna fight tyranny and defend liberty and goodness in this great time of wickedness?
[02:30:26.287 --> 02:30:28.969]  And we're gonna ride... Are you gonna ride?
[02:30:29.469 --> 02:30:31.170]  We're gonna ride...
[02:30:34.699 --> 02:30:52.325]  It's so good to be fighting tyranny, to be fully alive, to be fulfilling my destiny.
[02:30:52.725 --> 02:30:54.626]  And I know you're going to fulfill yours as well.
[02:30:55.166 --> 02:30:58.768]  Just as the enemy on the dark side will fulfill their destiny to be defeated.
[02:31:00.088 --> 02:31:00.828]  All right.
[02:31:01.669 --> 02:31:02.669]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:31:04.827 --> 02:31:12.010]  We are asking for support, financial support, by buying the books and videos, materials, or donating, because I realize we are having such a massive effect.
[02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:18.613]  I've got a responsibility to expand and fight, and you support us, we will spend it on the fight against the New World Order.
[02:31:18.673 --> 02:31:20.614]  You have my word of honor on that.
[02:31:21.895 --> 02:31:23.295]  We will expand this place radically.
[02:31:23.336 --> 02:31:24.316]  We will go to the next level.
[02:31:27.057 --> 02:31:30.219]  And, I mean, is there any place else fighting as hard as we are?
[02:31:30.259 --> 02:31:31.539]  Thanks to you, The List, for spreading the word.
[02:31:31.579 --> 02:31:32.960]  Go ahead and finish up your comments, Mark.
[02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:35.687]  I think it's great you're going to do it, Alex.
[02:31:35.887 --> 02:31:42.555]  I would bet good money that you're going to receive at least as much support financially as you did in the last money bomb.
[02:31:42.955 --> 02:31:50.745]  I think there's a good probability you're going to be amazed by how much support you get because I think you have educated enough people now and it goes into the millions.
[02:31:51.212 --> 02:31:56.896]  That they're really going to want to support you when they look at what happened today in this inauguration and what it all means to us.
[02:31:57.317 --> 02:32:02.200]  Times of the Essence, you're doing beautiful, Alex, and I'll try to think of some more ideas.
[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:04.382]  I've got a couple, but I don't want to take up all your time.
[02:32:04.422 --> 02:32:05.123]  God bless you, brother.
[02:32:05.163 --> 02:32:05.683]  God bless you.
[02:32:05.723 --> 02:32:11.628]  Well, you guys, men, women, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, you're doing an amazing job.
[02:32:12.802 --> 02:32:17.787]  The people spreading the words, the YouTube clips, the materials, how people can listen to the links.
[02:32:17.867 --> 02:32:20.950]  It's all exponentially growing and that's why we've got to kick it into high gear.
[02:32:21.070 --> 02:32:29.318]  And this has really concerned me, the economy imploding with our capitalization, being able to fund ourselves, our capital improvements and going to the next level.
[02:32:29.338 --> 02:32:32.340]  And I'm so busy staying up here until 11 last night working on the Obama film.
[02:32:33.021 --> 02:32:48.477]  With Aaron and Rob that, you know, I keep meaning to get a video camera out, shoot some video of the office and the studio, show folks what we've done with the support, but I'm so busy manning the guns, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, you know, I'm so busy with the Kamikaze New World Order coming in on us that, you know, I've got to do that other stuff because...
[02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:50.900]  But I'm saying don't even wait for a money bomb.
[02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:53.441]  That takes setting up a website and organizing it and launching it.
[02:32:53.901 --> 02:32:54.942]  We don't even have time for that.
[02:32:54.962 --> 02:32:55.662]  Just support us.
[02:32:55.682 --> 02:32:59.843]  Write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:33:00.583 --> 02:33:04.184]  Or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership or buy a couple memberships and give them to people.
[02:33:04.484 --> 02:33:05.565]  Buy the DVDs, the books.
[02:33:05.605 --> 02:33:07.705]  Just support us, support us, support us, support us.
[02:33:08.766 --> 02:33:11.367]  Let's go ahead and go to Michael in Canada.
[02:33:11.387 --> 02:33:11.967]  You're on the air.
[02:33:11.987 --> 02:33:13.347]  Hello Alex.
[02:33:13.407 --> 02:33:14.908]  I just want to say God bless.
[02:33:14.968 --> 02:33:16.268]  Thank you for all your hard work.
[02:33:17.175 --> 02:33:21.078]  I definitely appreciate all your insightful news that we get every day, and all your great guests.
[02:33:21.679 --> 02:33:28.964]  I am a Prison Planet subscriber, and I support your idea to put a donation box either through PayPal or have your address right up there.
[02:33:29.305 --> 02:33:30.506]  You've got a ton of websites, man.
[02:33:30.526 --> 02:33:31.566]  Put it on all your websites.
[02:33:31.607 --> 02:33:34.249]  Top left-hand corner, top right-hand corner, under contact information.
[02:33:34.789 --> 02:33:37.371]  Get it out there, because I didn't write down the 3001 post office box that you gave.
[02:33:38.952 --> 02:33:40.172]  But I would definitely send you more money.
[02:33:40.212 --> 02:33:49.455]  Well, what happened is, in the last six months, we finally, and I'm going to hold you over, got professional and had professional accountants do things, and I wasn't in as good a position as I thought I was to do the growth.
[02:33:49.495 --> 02:33:50.315]  I said, oh, I'm doing good.
[02:33:50.355 --> 02:33:50.875]  I can grow.
[02:33:50.895 --> 02:33:56.197]  Then I went, good Lord, good thing we did that money bomb that somebody else thought of, or I wouldn't even be operating right now.
[02:33:56.497 --> 02:34:02.379]  And I'm kind of going, hmm, looking at the clock and looking at the money go down, and I'm just like, man, this is important work.
[02:34:02.419 --> 02:34:03.419]  We've got to do this now.
[02:34:04.219 --> 02:34:05.400]  And yes, we're going to do it.
[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:08.162]  We're going to... I don't want to beat a dead horse over and over again.
[02:34:08.182 --> 02:34:15.366]  I just felt I needed to say this today, and some of the things going on behind the scenes, people trying to stop us, that we're not going to give in to them.
[02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:17.187]  People try to keep me from doing something?
[02:34:17.207 --> 02:34:18.408]  Well, we'll just intensify it.
[02:34:18.448 --> 02:34:19.028]  How's that sound?
[02:34:19.328 --> 02:34:21.050]  We'll be right back when you finish your phone call.
[02:34:21.090 --> 02:34:21.550]  Straight ahead.
[02:34:21.570 --> 02:34:22.450]  70-second break.
[02:34:25.452 --> 02:34:29.115]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:34:33.882 --> 02:34:35.463]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:34:35.583 --> 02:34:40.225]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:34:40.325 --> 02:34:43.066]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:34:43.266 --> 02:34:46.127]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:34:46.327 --> 02:34:51.049]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:34:51.269 --> 02:34:52.210]  If you simply prepare.
[02:34:52.390 --> 02:34:55.332]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:34:55.632 --> 02:35:02.538]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[02:35:02.638 --> 02:35:05.760]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:35:22.493 --> 02:35:23.714]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:35:36.633 --> 02:35:38.534]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:35:39.015 --> 02:35:41.957]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:35:49.342 --> 02:35:51.043]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:35:51.143 --> 02:35:51.803]  Crashing!
[02:35:52.264 --> 02:35:53.324]  We are crashing!
[02:35:54.045 --> 02:35:55.946]  With the lies and disinformation.
[02:35:57.667 --> 02:35:59.248]  Not waiting for orders from headquarters.
[02:35:59.829 --> 02:36:01.130]  Firing in all directions.
[02:36:02.602 --> 02:36:03.603]  We're completely surrounded.
[02:36:03.883 --> 02:36:04.163]  Good.
[02:36:05.183 --> 02:36:06.804]  That makes our situation simpler.
[02:36:07.244 --> 02:36:08.465]  Don't let the enemy escape.
[02:36:12.167 --> 02:36:13.608]  Don't let the parasites win.
[02:36:13.708 --> 02:36:14.388]  Expose them.
[02:36:14.448 --> 02:36:15.529]  Expose their crimes.
[02:36:16.129 --> 02:36:29.816]  Through the committees of correspondence, the organic resistance corps, battle stations, battle stations, battle stations, in the information war, go forward, committed, 110%, never back down, never surrender, never waver.
[02:36:32.148 --> 02:36:33.989]  This is history, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:34.009 --> 02:36:42.976]  The New World Order has pulled out of its pocket the classic messianic leader to try to sell the public of the false organic movement to bring in their great tyranny.
[02:36:43.516 --> 02:36:46.438]  This is the fight of our lives, the fight of a generation.
[02:36:47.059 --> 02:36:49.300]  The United States falling to complete tyranny.
[02:36:49.941 --> 02:36:50.761]  Martial law.
[02:36:51.122 --> 02:36:52.543]  War Powers Act declared.
[02:36:53.043 --> 02:36:53.463]  Congress
[02:36:54.404 --> 02:36:54.925]  Literally.
[02:36:55.866 --> 02:36:56.446]  Ceremonial.
[02:36:56.807 --> 02:36:58.369]  The state's being fully absorbed.
[02:36:59.049 --> 02:37:01.892]  And the message to historians is, I am Lincoln.
[02:37:02.493 --> 02:37:03.694]  I bring federalization.
[02:37:03.795 --> 02:37:05.056]  I bring international control.
[02:37:05.456 --> 02:37:06.478]  I bring the New World Order.
[02:37:06.518 --> 02:37:11.083]  That is what Barack Obama is saying, this wicked puppet of the New World Order.
[02:37:11.323 --> 02:37:12.204]  Alright, going back to...
[02:37:13.385 --> 02:37:25.697]  I was just talking to Michael in Canada, then I'm going to go to Mike in Montana, Scott, Brian and Tristan, then I'm going to get into the video clips and audio clips here and more analysis on the coronation of the front demigod puppet today.
[02:37:25.857 --> 02:37:26.378]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:37:27.188 --> 02:37:28.969]  Okay, I'll finish up quickly on topic there.
[02:37:29.549 --> 02:37:44.754]  I just, like, I'm on the CFR website here, and Barack Obama, like, you know, he's campaigned on change, yet, you know, he's a member of a known, you know, think tank, or right-wing think tank, whatever, CFR, and in his biography... No, no, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[02:37:45.819 --> 02:38:00.923]  The CFR was publicly founded in 1922 at Pratt House in New York as a British roundtable group by British intelligence to work through the private Federal Reserve, owned predominantly by the Bank of England, to take over industry, the media, and the government and banking, and they've done it.
[02:38:01.243 --> 02:38:03.723]  It is the Imperium true government.
[02:38:03.743 --> 02:38:04.123]  Go ahead.
[02:38:04.443 --> 02:38:05.164]  Oh, definitely, sir.
[02:38:05.784 --> 02:38:15.446]  And, uh, but here on their website it says, Obama says the United States needs to renew its global leadership position through skillful diplomacy, a revitalized military, and by confronting nuclear proliferation,
[02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:19.031]  Which he calls the most urgent threat to the security of America and the world.
[02:38:19.351 --> 02:38:20.291]  Like, how has this changed?
[02:38:20.311 --> 02:38:25.913]  Like, this is Cold War rhetoric, and he's got Nicholas Brzezinski or whatever as his, you know, main dude in the background.
[02:38:26.293 --> 02:38:29.713]  How's that change we can believe in with Cold War rhetoric as his main front?
[02:38:30.134 --> 02:38:30.594]  You know?
[02:38:31.854 --> 02:38:32.654]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:38:32.694 --> 02:38:33.775]  You're completely on target.
[02:38:33.795 --> 02:38:34.775]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:35.215 --> 02:38:37.575]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Montana.
[02:38:37.916 --> 02:38:38.596]  Montana, Mike.
[02:38:38.636 --> 02:38:38.976]  Go ahead.
[02:38:40.076 --> 02:38:40.456]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:40.516 --> 02:38:41.697]  You do a really good job.
[02:38:41.757 --> 02:38:43.477]  Got a hands-off to you on that.
[02:38:44.523 --> 02:38:45.703]  It's a real interesting day.
[02:38:47.765 --> 02:38:52.649]  I like a lot of stuff that you've been telling me and everybody else.
[02:38:53.170 --> 02:38:56.832]  I'm glad you pointed out that it's a lot murkier waters.
[02:38:56.893 --> 02:39:03.058]  I mean, it's not real simple when you talk about the players and the world and about people's motives.
[02:39:05.399 --> 02:39:10.864]  What you said just earlier brought something to mind to me is that it actually
[02:39:11.718 --> 02:39:14.920]  When you get to the bottom of the murky water, there's something solid down there.
[02:39:16.181 --> 02:39:17.101]  And there's some truth.
[02:39:17.842 --> 02:39:20.604]  And I think it's evil against good.
[02:39:21.384 --> 02:39:21.604]  Right?
[02:39:22.045 --> 02:39:22.425]  That's right.
[02:39:22.445 --> 02:39:24.906]  And the spirit of evil and good works through everyone.
[02:39:25.687 --> 02:39:27.968]  Yeah, so, I mean, I believe in principles, don't you?
[02:39:28.449 --> 02:39:28.689]  Yes.
[02:39:29.449 --> 02:39:34.212]  I mean, if you had a friend, right or wrong, that got himself in trouble, you'd back him up, wouldn't you?
[02:39:35.814 --> 02:39:36.974]  Well, it depends.
[02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:40.897]  I mean, if I had somebody I thought was my friend and they were robbing banks, I wouldn't back them.
[02:39:42.109 --> 02:39:43.750]  No, I mean, you know what I mean.
[02:39:45.051 --> 02:39:48.093]  If you had a friend who was in trouble, that's what friendship is.
[02:39:48.153 --> 02:39:50.574]  Either you're an acquaintance or you're a friend.
[02:39:50.654 --> 02:39:54.376]  It's loyalty, but you've also got to be loyal to the truth and the morals.
[02:39:55.157 --> 02:39:56.017]  Exactly.
[02:39:57.138 --> 02:39:58.779]  You believe the stories in the Bible, right?
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:00.260]  Yes.
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:02.441]  I do too, and a lot of people do.
[02:40:02.481 --> 02:40:09.325]  Have you ever imagined if you went back in time, after reading the stories in the Bible, would you have sided with King David?
[02:40:10.001 --> 02:40:13.023]  Um, in his fights and struggles against, uh, the Philistines?
[02:40:15.425 --> 02:40:16.025]  Well, yes.
[02:40:16.906 --> 02:40:17.166]  Okay.
[02:40:17.506 --> 02:40:24.130]  Well, I was just wondering, um, you know, I heard some stuff on, uh... But the people in Israel today, it's not King David.
[02:40:25.431 --> 02:40:26.992]  Well, you know, God has a plan.
[02:40:27.232 --> 02:40:28.593]  I mean, Jesus is coming back.
[02:40:29.394 --> 02:40:32.295]  Well, a lot of people use that as a cop-out, and they thought that under Hitler.
[02:40:32.556 --> 02:40:33.656]  But I appreciate your call.
[02:40:33.736 --> 02:40:34.437]  I'm gonna fight evil.
[02:40:35.157 --> 02:40:36.758]  And what Israel's doing in Gaza is evil.
[02:40:36.938 --> 02:40:37.479]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:43.939 --> 02:40:49.604]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:40:49.784 --> 02:40:54.949]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:40:55.209 --> 02:41:00.293]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:41:00.594 --> 02:41:04.157]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[02:41:04.437 --> 02:41:06.159]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[02:41:06.479 --> 02:41:09.221]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[02:41:09.421 --> 02:41:12.484]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:41:12.704 --> 02:41:16.247]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:41:16.507 --> 02:41:21.051]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:41:21.332 --> 02:41:22.112]  Do your part.
[02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:24.654]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:41:24.995 --> 02:41:31.120]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:35.664]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:41:35.704 --> 02:41:37.145]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[02:41:53.016 --> 02:41:53.857]  Who is the enemy?
[02:41:54.378 --> 02:41:54.878]  Bin Laden.
[02:41:55.178 --> 02:41:56.159]  This is his M.O.
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:57.481]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:41:57.541 --> 02:41:59.203]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:06.290]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:07.131]  Some U.S.
[02:42:07.171 --> 02:42:12.817]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:42:13.517 --> 02:42:16.959]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:42:16.979 --> 02:42:19.160]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:42:44.298 --> 02:42:45.539]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[02:42:45.839 --> 02:42:46.960]  eFoods does it again.
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:51.982]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[02:42:52.303 --> 02:43:00.447]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[02:43:00.968 --> 02:43:08.612]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[02:43:09.012 --> 02:43:11.814]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency,
[02:43:12.233 --> 02:43:15.575]  The Food and the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[02:43:16.055 --> 02:43:17.516]  Food is an everyday need.
[02:43:18.097 --> 02:43:23.200]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:25.742]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[02:43:27.103 --> 02:43:30.325]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[02:43:30.685 --> 02:43:32.846]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:43:33.146 --> 02:43:35.628]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:46.585]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:43:47.146 --> 02:43:49.952]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:43:52.728 --> 02:43:53.328]  We are back live.
[02:43:53.348 --> 02:43:55.589]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:43:56.149 --> 02:43:59.491]  Speaking of sponsors, we only take sponsors I believe in that I've checked out.
[02:43:59.731 --> 02:44:03.893]  We have to turn down about 80% of the people that contact us every day wanting to be sponsors.
[02:44:03.913 --> 02:44:05.053]  So whatever I plug, I believe in it.
[02:44:05.073 --> 02:44:06.414]  If you hear me endorsing it, I believe in it.
[02:44:07.174 --> 02:44:17.639]  Speaking of this one plug, this one sponsor today, not only is it a great deal and great seeds, it will pay, roughly, for one of the guys to be in here for six, seven hours today doing work.
[02:44:18.599 --> 02:44:20.441]  So again, that's why we also have the sponsors.
[02:44:20.481 --> 02:44:23.844]  But that's literally how important this advertising is to us.
[02:44:24.384 --> 02:44:25.785]  That's how we run this operation.
[02:44:26.186 --> 02:44:27.007]  So keep that in mind.
[02:44:27.027 --> 02:44:28.848]  Survivalofseeds.com.
[02:44:29.589 --> 02:44:31.270]  Knowing that something's coming is not the solution.
[02:44:31.310 --> 02:44:32.812]  Preparing for what's coming is the answer.
[02:44:33.132 --> 02:44:35.094]  Get 7 years of healthy food for pennies a pound.
[02:44:35.114 --> 02:44:36.275]  100% heirloom seeds.

[02:44:48.885 --> 02:44:52.287]  It's seeds five times cheaper than the GM trash sold at Death Mart.
[02:44:53.148 --> 02:44:56.991]  Some same-day priority shipping by USPS.
[02:44:57.651 --> 02:45:00.153]  You can go online to survivalistseeds.com.
[02:45:00.213 --> 02:45:01.714]  At survivalistseeds.com or call 620...
[02:45:04.295 --> 02:45:04.735]  637-2978.
[02:45:04.875 --> 02:45:05.895]  That's 620-637-2978.
[02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:13.517]  You can send Checker Money Order as well.
[02:45:14.397 --> 02:45:16.798]  They have an address there on the site.
[02:45:17.218 --> 02:45:21.219]  Without a long-term food solution, you will be under the control of the globalists.
[02:45:21.239 --> 02:45:23.659]  You're not independent or become a slave to them.
[02:45:24.799 --> 02:45:26.900]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, survivalofseeds.com.
[02:45:30.445 --> 02:45:32.567]  Um, let's go ahead and try to hurry back to your calls.
[02:45:32.607 --> 02:45:34.729]  Each caller brings up such deep and important questions.
[02:45:34.769 --> 02:45:36.810]  I hate having to cut them off, but we won't be able to get to the next caller.
[02:45:37.150 --> 02:45:38.131]  Scott in California.
[02:45:38.151 --> 02:45:38.732]  You're on the air.
[02:45:38.772 --> 02:45:39.112]  Go ahead.
[02:45:40.953 --> 02:45:41.434]  Hi, Alex.
[02:45:41.994 --> 02:45:42.214]  Hi.
[02:45:42.735 --> 02:45:46.858]  Hi, um, uh, first time caller.
[02:45:47.359 --> 02:45:48.720]  And to be honest, I don't know.
[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:54.524]  Uh, I can't believe I'm doing it, but I saw a thing out here in the Orange County Register.
[02:45:54.544 --> 02:45:56.606]  I sent you an email about it the other day.
[02:45:57.446 --> 02:46:03.668]  About how the Supreme Court just loosened the illegal search and seizure rules in the Fourth Amendment?
[02:46:03.828 --> 02:46:04.848]  Yeah, they're getting rid of everything.
[02:46:04.908 --> 02:46:05.868]  Fourth Amendment, everything.
[02:46:07.989 --> 02:46:08.849]  I can't believe it.
[02:46:09.249 --> 02:46:10.409]  I can't believe what I read.
[02:46:10.830 --> 02:46:12.970]  They've introduced bills to ban most guns.
[02:46:13.090 --> 02:46:14.951]  It's introduced.
[02:46:15.811 --> 02:46:16.551]  It's all happening.
[02:46:16.831 --> 02:46:18.672]  It's all because of H.R.
[02:46:18.892 --> 02:46:18.672]  1022.
[02:46:20.172 --> 02:46:23.293]  What you had said about that, I went and looked it up and you were right on the money.
[02:46:23.908 --> 02:46:25.030]  Sir, we make nothing up here.
[02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.551]  That's what I mean.
[02:46:25.571 --> 02:46:28.636]  I mean, they're openly announcing world government run by the banks that have engineered everything.
[02:46:28.796 --> 02:46:32.423]  They're openly building FEMA camps, and I'm called a radical.
[02:46:33.144 --> 02:46:36.450]  I'm part of that unawakened crowd you talk about.
[02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:37.772]  I served in the Marine Corps.
[02:46:38.682 --> 02:46:40.043]  I'm a disabled vet now.
[02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:41.063]  Here's an example.
[02:46:41.123 --> 02:46:43.624]  I've got Marines calling themselves, you know, Marines with their handles.
[02:46:43.924 --> 02:46:55.429]  You Google their handle, you see their Facebook, and they're on there saying, I'm a liar, I'm unpatriotic, that there's been no peer-reviewed studies of 9-11 truth groups when there have been peer-reviewed studies.
[02:46:55.909 --> 02:46:58.090]  They're delusional, but a lot of them aren't.
[02:46:58.110 --> 02:46:58.450]  Go ahead.
[02:46:59.591 --> 02:47:03.632]  I just want to try to pound home this Fourth Amendment thing.
[02:47:05.842 --> 02:47:06.422]  It's happening!
[02:47:07.402 --> 02:47:07.962]  It's happening!
[02:47:08.983 --> 02:47:11.103]  It's got me so messed up.
[02:47:11.143 --> 02:47:14.664]  This is not the Constitution that I was willing to give my life away for.
[02:47:14.684 --> 02:47:17.064]  They're gutting it.
[02:47:18.004 --> 02:47:19.885]  Sir, the Patriot Act has been used.
[02:47:20.005 --> 02:47:20.545]  Google this.
[02:47:21.085 --> 02:47:23.566]  Patriot Act used in non-terror related cases.
[02:47:23.906 --> 02:47:25.446]  Patriot Act used in drug cases.
[02:47:26.126 --> 02:47:29.747]  In one state, like four or five years ago, only a year or two into the Patriot Act,
[02:47:30.913 --> 02:47:31.273]  What was it?
[02:47:31.313 --> 02:47:32.755]  It was South Carolina, I believe.
[02:47:32.815 --> 02:47:34.076]  It was one article I read on air.
[02:47:34.096 --> 02:47:34.856]  I've seen hundreds.
[02:47:35.297 --> 02:47:44.064]  And it said more than 10,000 non-terror related cases, family violence, gun crime, drugs.
[02:47:44.144 --> 02:47:47.788]  It listed a whole bunch of stuff where they just say, we don't even use the Bill of Rights now.
[02:47:48.368 --> 02:47:50.189]  And the Supreme Court is getting in line.
[02:47:50.209 --> 02:47:52.390]  See, they said it was for Al-Qaeda, which is fake.
[02:47:52.710 --> 02:48:00.973]  But regardless, if you believe that, they're now saying the troops in NORTHCOM and the Marines are for suppressing the American people.
[02:48:01.633 --> 02:48:06.335]  They've got the 3rd Infantry Division ready to mobilize whenever they need them.
[02:48:06.435 --> 02:48:09.857]  They started with that, and then a month later announced, no, it'll be 20,000 troops, not 4,000.
[02:48:10.397 --> 02:48:12.077]  Now they've announced, no, it'll actually be 60,000.
[02:48:13.718 --> 02:48:15.779]  I've heard it's went all the way up to the entire division.
[02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:18.653]  Which is around... No, no, I mean it's all announced.
[02:48:18.693 --> 02:48:19.855]  It's Army Times.
[02:48:20.756 --> 02:48:25.122]  They have Marines all over the country running checkpoints at DUIs.
[02:48:26.964 --> 02:48:28.806]  Yeah, I've seen that out here in California.
[02:48:29.246 --> 02:48:42.419]  Go read articles we wrote five, six, seven, eight years ago, and I said they will start at DUI checkpoints, they will start with bomb disposal, they will start with the jaws of life to help people at car wrecks and airlift people to get everybody used to, why is the army here?
[02:48:42.839 --> 02:48:44.261]  Well, they're here to help stop the drunks.
[02:48:44.301 --> 02:48:46.263]  You're not against stopping drunks, are you?
[02:48:46.683 --> 02:48:49.946]  Again, Obama has announced forced youth brigades, 18 to 24,
[02:48:52.188 --> 02:48:56.331]  And then instead of talking about it on the news, they go, Obama's gonna give soup kitchens!
[02:48:56.811 --> 02:48:58.172]  See, that sounds reasonable.
[02:48:58.352 --> 02:49:01.814]  Marines are gonna help car wrecks!
[02:49:01.834 --> 02:49:02.775]  That's not our job.
[02:49:02.795 --> 02:49:03.836]  We're not built for that.
[02:49:03.956 --> 02:49:05.497]  But do you see the psych warfare?
[02:49:06.658 --> 02:49:11.541]  I do, and unfortunately, you know, it looks like for the last 20 years of my life, I've been a victim of it.
[02:49:12.842 --> 02:49:14.183]  We've all been victims of it, sir.
[02:49:14.223 --> 02:49:15.203]  I'm not completely awake.
[02:49:15.263 --> 02:49:16.104]  I don't know everything.
[02:49:17.445 --> 02:49:20.887]  You know, I think I'm to the point to where I don't want to know anymore.
[02:49:21.527 --> 02:49:22.448]  Well, here's the problem.
[02:49:22.468 --> 02:49:23.649]  Because it's just ripping my heart out.
[02:49:23.929 --> 02:49:24.509]  Here's the problem.
[02:49:24.549 --> 02:49:25.450]  It's only going to get worse.
[02:49:25.650 --> 02:49:26.731]  See, people think I'm negative.
[02:49:26.771 --> 02:49:27.352]  I'm not negative.
[02:49:27.372 --> 02:49:29.974]  You know, let's say I stepped on a nail.
[02:49:29.994 --> 02:49:32.716]  This actually happened when I was a little kid in a construction site by the house.
[02:49:33.596 --> 02:49:34.437]  It got really infected.
[02:49:35.058 --> 02:49:36.539]  And I kind of ignored it because I never went to the doctor.
[02:49:36.559 --> 02:49:38.040]  I never told my parents when I got hurt and stuff.
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:39.861]  And finally I had to go to the doctor and get it all worked on.
[02:49:40.862 --> 02:49:45.448]  Now what if it had been negative for me to say I've stepped on a nail, green pus is coming out of it.
[02:49:45.548 --> 02:49:46.149]  Is that negative?
[02:49:46.169 --> 02:49:46.349]  No.
[02:49:46.890 --> 02:49:57.102]  If you stepped on a nail and a week later green pus is coming out of your foot, it's positive to admit green pus is coming out of your foot and that you've got a staph infection and to go to the doctor.
[02:49:57.443 --> 02:49:59.726]  Now is it negative to admit you stepped on a nail?
[02:50:00.782 --> 02:50:01.483]  Absolutely not.
[02:50:02.143 --> 02:50:02.904]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:50:02.924 --> 02:50:05.646]  I mean, they've admitted they've built FEMA camps.
[02:50:05.907 --> 02:50:10.351]  They've hired 26,000 preachers and they've got them out giving sermons about turning your guns in.
[02:50:11.667 --> 02:50:15.448]  I mean, the Pentagon and NORTHCOM aren't playing games, man.
[02:50:15.648 --> 02:50:17.048]  They've already stolen $8.5 trillion.
[02:50:17.068 --> 02:50:20.289]  $4 trillion has been stolen from the Pentagon pension funds.
[02:50:20.809 --> 02:50:22.469]  The elites are looting us.
[02:50:22.649 --> 02:50:25.270]  Offshore corporations are bringing us down.
[02:50:25.750 --> 02:50:31.551]  And they know the public's going to resist, so they're making Obama a cult leader to suppress the people and fool them to go along with it.
[02:50:31.731 --> 02:50:34.632]  And if that doesn't work, they say they're going to use NORTHCOM on us.
[02:50:35.912 --> 02:50:40.693]  Well, my opinion on the Obama thing is we're going to have to put up with this for about two, three more months.
[02:50:41.553 --> 02:50:46.976]  Cult of Obama thing, but it's going to stop when Charlie Rangel tries to push the universal draft through.
[02:50:47.817 --> 02:50:55.081]  Because all those college kids that went out and mobilized for Obama are finally going to wake up and learn that they are going to be forced to serve in the military.
[02:50:56.522 --> 02:50:57.542]  Well see, it's worse than that.
[02:50:57.582 --> 02:50:59.503]  They're not going to make all these yuppie kids do that.
[02:50:59.523 --> 02:51:04.606]  They're going to give them uniforms and a one million man domestic security force and they're going to like it.
[02:51:05.927 --> 02:51:06.868]  Oh yeah, I heard about that.
[02:51:08.750 --> 02:51:09.631]  The security force?
[02:51:09.651 --> 02:51:18.476]  Sir, there is a green... Sir, we have video of them already during the campaign six months ago when Obama was here for the debate in Austin in green uniforms with green helmets.
[02:51:19.097 --> 02:51:20.217]  Officially under Obama.
[02:51:20.257 --> 02:51:21.918]  They are going to wear uniforms.
[02:51:22.699 --> 02:51:25.741]  Environmental Corps, Spy Corps, Police Corps.
[02:51:26.821 --> 02:51:29.083]  And then the media is going to focus in on the Soup Corps.
[02:51:33.151 --> 02:51:44.238]  And when you say you don't want Obama control freaks running around your neighborhood, spying and bossing and shouting people down at local meetings, they're gonna sit there and say you're a racist and you're against feeding people soup.
[02:51:45.218 --> 02:51:47.960]  Well, Alex, that feeds right back into what I called about today.
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:57.946]  Because of this Fourth Amendment rule that they've loosened, they're not only going to be doing it in your neighborhoods, they can walk into your house and look around and pick whatever the hell they want.
[02:51:58.772 --> 02:51:59.492]  And haul you out.
[02:51:59.852 --> 02:52:02.453]  That's the sneak and peek provision of Patriot Act.
[02:52:02.793 --> 02:52:05.573]  They pass that and then they're getting the court in line with it.
[02:52:06.753 --> 02:52:09.374]  Oh, well, you know, look at that subpoena you got today.
[02:52:09.794 --> 02:52:12.074]  That poor jerk that wrote that on the website?
[02:52:12.294 --> 02:52:12.554]  Yeah.
[02:52:13.215 --> 02:52:18.595]  They are going to come to his house and there is a provision in the Patriot Act, which I looked at because you told me to go look at it.
[02:52:19.456 --> 02:52:21.196]  They can charge him as a terrorist.
[02:52:21.616 --> 02:52:21.896]  I know.
[02:52:22.596 --> 02:52:27.257]  And they can do all those things in the Patriot Act that are supposed to be against
[02:52:28.345 --> 02:52:33.310]  Terrorists that are supposed to be trying to bring down our government and use it against a stupid American citizen.
[02:52:33.350 --> 02:52:45.221]  Sir, they have charged 17-year-old high school seniors with no criminal record for writing an article about zombies attacking a fictitious school for... and then the guy's grandparents in this one case reported on him.
[02:52:45.522 --> 02:52:46.543]  They charged him.
[02:52:46.563 --> 02:52:48.905]  Oh look, he wrote an article about zombies.
[02:52:49.626 --> 02:52:51.327]  He wrote a fiction story like Stephen King.
[02:52:52.168 --> 02:53:03.995]  And then his grandparents read it, he lived with them, and they reported him, and were proud, and the police said, great job, and they said, it doesn't matter if it's a fiction story, you're not allowed to write about that, and they charged him as a terrorist.
[02:53:04.976 --> 02:53:05.596]  Oh my God.
[02:53:06.197 --> 02:53:07.217]  It's secret police.
[02:53:07.478 --> 02:53:11.380]  Listen, I told the story in my audio blog yesterday.
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:14.482]  My wife hadn't told me about this in a week and a half, she forgot about it.
[02:53:14.522 --> 02:53:15.523]  Before we went on vacation,
[02:53:16.573 --> 02:53:18.916]  We had repairmen there at the house.
[02:53:19.517 --> 02:53:21.039]  We had air-conditioned repairmen.
[02:53:21.119 --> 02:53:23.822]  We have garbage disposal repairmen, whatever, because I don't have the time to be there.
[02:53:25.004 --> 02:53:30.991]  And my children, we're homeschooling them, trying that out.
[02:53:31.192 --> 02:53:31.813]  They're very small.
[02:53:33.445 --> 02:53:37.207]  And the people said, your children should be in school.
[02:53:38.007 --> 02:53:40.489]  And my wife said, well no, they're homeschooled.
[02:53:40.509 --> 02:53:41.749]  And they said, that's illegal.
[02:53:42.110 --> 02:53:43.390]  Started looking at my wife weird.
[02:53:43.931 --> 02:53:45.511]  That's, it's not illegal.
[02:53:46.152 --> 02:53:46.532]  You see?
[02:53:47.292 --> 02:53:57.998]  But the point is, is that every time I hear about CPS going after a family, it's neighbors see the children on recess who are homeschooling, playing on the jungle gym in their backyard, and they call the police.
[02:53:58.098 --> 02:53:59.359]  That's the secret police.
[02:54:00.359 --> 02:54:05.843]  And now with the loosening of the Fourth Amendment, they don't have to just stop with what they came to your house for.
[02:54:06.563 --> 02:54:12.567]  They can look around and you could be a totally innocent person doing absolutely nothing wrong in your home.
[02:54:12.587 --> 02:54:15.369]  They come for one reason and haul your ass off for something else.
[02:54:15.409 --> 02:54:27.197]  Sir, I'm not even looking for the stories and in the last couple years I've seen three articles in three different areas where people went in Best Buy, Walmart and one other place and tried to pay with a two dollar bill.
[02:54:28.478 --> 02:54:29.759]  The people are arrested.
[02:54:31.283 --> 02:54:35.646]  The police come and are so ignorant, they don't know a $2 bill, the Declaration of Independence is real.
[02:54:36.666 --> 02:54:40.709]  And then they are, in one case, were still charged and went to court and were convicted.
[02:54:41.149 --> 02:54:48.474]  Because the judge, the jury, and everyone were so ignorant, and the system was so predatory, they got them for trying to use counterfeit funds.
[02:54:50.643 --> 02:54:55.225]  You understand, sir, there are people going to jail for not vaccinating their children when there's no law.
[02:54:55.965 --> 02:54:58.346]  There are people being arrested for handing out my videos.
[02:54:58.446 --> 02:55:03.028]  It's in the newspaper, and then they still, and then thank God the juries don't convict them.
[02:55:03.569 --> 02:55:05.129]  One case in Tennessee, one in Kentucky.
[02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:07.010]  I have a question for you.
[02:55:07.090 --> 02:55:14.413]  The whole dust-up with you in back of the Geraldo Show in New York City that time, didn't you guys have a legal permit to be there?
[02:55:15.534 --> 02:55:17.015]  We had a permit to march.
[02:55:19.792 --> 02:55:24.276]  Yes, but they said an unauthorized sound device, which was really a $200 fine.
[02:55:24.577 --> 02:55:29.681]  So once I got in the jail, the captain came in and there was a crowd protesting and he said, yeah, this is not arrestable.
[02:55:29.701 --> 02:55:30.462]  We're going to let you go.
[02:55:30.842 --> 02:55:36.007]  Then I had to pay like a thousand dollars in court to have a lawyer appear just to pay the fine in New York for me a month later.
[02:55:36.227 --> 02:55:36.827]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:36.847 --> 02:55:37.268]  Stay with us.
[02:55:44.295 --> 02:55:45.836]  These are strange new days.
[02:55:46.196 --> 02:55:47.958]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[02:55:48.078 --> 02:55:49.499]  People are losing their jobs.
[02:55:49.779 --> 02:55:51.760]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[02:55:52.001 --> 02:55:54.182]  Food supplies are at an all-time low.
[02:55:54.362 --> 02:55:56.484]  And now we have a new untested president.
[02:55:56.704 --> 02:55:58.385]  The time of change is upon us.
[02:55:58.485 --> 02:56:03.169]  And to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[02:56:03.789 --> 02:56:04.269]  I think so.
[02:56:24.718 --> 02:56:25.579]  I don't think so.
[02:56:44.736 --> 02:56:48.578]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:56:48.618 --> 02:56:49.879]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:56:50.019 --> 02:56:53.601]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:56:53.901 --> 02:56:56.402]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:56:56.822 --> 02:56:58.563]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:56:58.883 --> 02:57:01.185]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:57:02.245 --> 02:57:12.691]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:57:12.971 --> 02:57:16.673]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:57:16.733 --> 02:57:19.815]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:57:20.035 --> 02:57:22.216]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-GOLD.
[02:57:23.457 --> 02:57:26.480]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[02:57:27.261 --> 02:57:29.644]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[02:57:29.884 --> 02:57:30.384]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[02:57:30.424 --> 02:57:32.867]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:57:32.927 --> 02:57:33.968]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[02:57:43.763 --> 02:57:45.744]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:57:45.884 --> 02:57:48.265]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:57:48.285 --> 02:57:50.886]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:57:51.006 --> 02:57:52.106]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:57:52.126 --> 02:57:53.747]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:57:53.847 --> 02:57:56.668]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:57:56.728 --> 02:58:00.349]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:58:10.030 --> 02:58:14.818]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:58:14.878 --> 02:58:15.960]  An inside job.
[02:58:18.656 --> 02:58:19.757]  How dare you?
[02:58:21.118 --> 02:58:26.181]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:58:26.201 --> 02:58:28.982]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:58:29.082 --> 02:58:35.246]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:58:40.649 --> 02:58:43.131]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:58:44.071 --> 02:58:47.456]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:58:47.596 --> 02:58:52.823]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:58:53.003 --> 02:58:57.689]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:58:58.951 --> 02:59:09.313]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:59:09.673 --> 02:59:15.214]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:59:15.434 --> 02:59:21.495]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:59:21.695 --> 02:59:22.355]  What about you?

[02:59:45.422 --> 02:59:49.764]  Okay, look, we got about 35 minutes left and I am going into overdrive.
[02:59:50.705 --> 03:00:01.330]  I know I have interviews with respective team members coming up, 15 after, but I'm sure we can go to 20 after and have the good folks wait out there because I have to cover all these clips.
[03:00:01.350 --> 03:00:03.451]  I have to get to all this news I said I was going to.
[03:00:04.631 --> 03:00:10.692]  In my stack, because I print most of my news, I research at night and in the morning, but the guys around the office get stuff and they bring it to me.
[03:00:11.512 --> 03:00:17.293]  Derek, one of our sales guys, just walked in during the break and said, oh, you're talking about the Patriot Act being used in non-terror related cases.
[03:00:18.673 --> 03:00:24.654]  He said, here is the LA Times, in-flight confrontations can lead to terrorism charges, January 20th.
[03:00:24.694 --> 03:00:25.715]  This is today.
[03:00:26.775 --> 03:00:29.315]  See, I have this stuff every day and don't even cover it.
[03:00:29.535 --> 03:00:31.596]  It's many times worse than I'm saying, folks.
[03:00:32.256 --> 03:00:33.076]  Many times worse.
[03:00:34.378 --> 03:00:39.021]  And people, uh, Kelly Rushing was charged with terrorism for handing out road to tyranny in a Ron Paul speech.
[03:00:39.701 --> 03:00:42.383]  And they charged him two counts for the Ron Paul speech.
[03:00:42.463 --> 03:00:48.447]  I called the judge at home, it was in the newspaper, and the judge said, yeah, I'm not going to talk about the case, but he's, uh, terrorism charges.
[03:00:50.428 --> 03:00:56.252]  And then I talked to people in his family, neighbors, business owner, been in there since that area was founded, old family.
[03:00:56.632 --> 03:01:00.815]  He just went up to some officers and said, hey, officers, these are some videos you need to watch for your family.
[03:01:03.567 --> 03:01:07.408]  Now, the jury found him not guilty, but this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:07.428 --> 03:01:08.308]  This isn't a game.
[03:01:08.668 --> 03:01:10.288]  Now, I want to show people this article.
[03:01:11.649 --> 03:01:18.750]  It says, Freeman's arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism under the Patriot Act.
[03:01:19.650 --> 03:01:23.791]  I had no idea I was breaking the law, said Freeman, who spent three months in jail before pleading guilty.
[03:01:23.991 --> 03:01:26.392]  They also keep you under terrorism until you plead guilty.
[03:01:27.862 --> 03:01:31.003]  And it says she's at least 200 people on flights have been convicted under the law.
[03:01:31.023 --> 03:01:32.024]  Now this happens outside.
[03:01:32.504 --> 03:01:38.326]  And it said that her daughter was being bad and so she slapped her on the knee.
[03:01:41.707 --> 03:01:46.569]  Her two children began to quarrel over the window shade and then spilled a Bloody Mary into her lap.
[03:01:46.889 --> 03:01:47.890]  She spanked each of them.
[03:01:49.716 --> 03:01:51.277]  On the thigh with three swats.
[03:01:52.258 --> 03:01:55.340]  It was a small incident, but one that has highlighted the anxiety of September 11th.
[03:01:55.420 --> 03:01:56.201]  Oh, terrorism!
[03:01:56.641 --> 03:01:57.602]  So the kids are out of control.
[03:01:57.622 --> 03:01:58.863]  She's like, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[03:01:59.123 --> 03:01:59.463]  Boom!
[03:01:59.863 --> 03:02:04.407]  She was taken off three months until she pled guilty, not allowed due process, charged under the Patriot Act.
[03:02:05.077 --> 03:02:10.578]  Every day, this is today, in my stack, and they said, don't you see that?
[03:02:10.898 --> 03:02:12.198]  We put that in your... Look at this.
[03:02:12.518 --> 03:02:13.698]  Look at these articles today.
[03:02:14.039 --> 03:02:14.699]  Never covered them.
[03:02:14.979 --> 03:02:15.779]  Look at this over here.
[03:02:15.959 --> 03:02:17.559]  Just big stacks of news everywhere.
[03:02:17.859 --> 03:02:18.179]  Right here.
[03:02:18.219 --> 03:02:18.859]  Zoom in on it.
[03:02:18.939 --> 03:02:19.359]  Zoom in.
[03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:21.240]  Swatting them on the leg.
[03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:23.460]  LA Times.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.061]  Folks, it's worse than I can explain to you.
[03:02:27.641 --> 03:02:29.401]  God help us, they've built FEMA camps.
[03:02:33.562 --> 03:02:34.262]  You see right there?
[03:02:35.655 --> 03:02:38.037]  In-flight confrontations can lead to terrorism charges.
[03:02:40.999 --> 03:02:42.220]  Stupid camera's not focusing.
[03:02:42.340 --> 03:02:44.282]  Well, there it is.
[03:02:48.725 --> 03:02:50.807]  I gotta get started on this or I'm never gonna get to it.
[03:02:51.768 --> 03:02:54.790]  This is one of the things running as a governmental ad.
[03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:57.973]  Some of the ads that are running promote Obama's private group.
[03:02:59.528 --> 03:03:01.849]  USAService.org, which is his private group.
[03:03:02.010 --> 03:03:05.392]  It's running his government ads everywhere right now.
[03:03:05.452 --> 03:03:06.572]  Giant media packages.
[03:03:08.673 --> 03:03:11.035]  And there's a long one where his wife says, get ready for pain.
[03:03:11.935 --> 03:03:12.616]  Go ahead and play it.
[03:03:12.656 --> 03:03:13.016]  Here it is.
[03:03:13.036 --> 03:03:16.018]  Look at all these heart-tugging images of helping people.
[03:03:16.058 --> 03:03:22.942]  America's greatness was not crafted in skyscrapers alone, but on the ground by those who could see what needed to be done.
[03:03:24.003 --> 03:03:26.144]  Volunteers who in service stepped forward.
[03:03:27.003 --> 03:03:32.166]  Onto the dust of the moon, the levee in the heartland, the marble steps of a dream.
[03:03:32.926 --> 03:03:37.248]  You may ask yourself, where's my moon, my levee, my dream?
[03:03:38.229 --> 03:03:39.790]  Well, it's here, with you.
[03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:41.411]  Step forward.
[03:03:41.991 --> 03:03:45.253]  Help renew America at usaservice.org.
[03:03:46.233 --> 03:03:54.878]  Now, that is a private foundation group, with Obama heading it up himself, ads everywhere, hundreds of thousands in a week alone since it launched, signed up.
[03:03:55.709 --> 03:03:59.451]  Hundreds of sign-ups and groups in Austin, mobilizing them.
[03:04:00.091 --> 03:04:06.934]  And again, it's soup kitchens, it's helping people on the surface, and when you read, it's for the environmental brigades, the tattle brigades, it's all there!
[03:04:07.814 --> 03:04:18.699]  Red-level emergency, and they're arresting people, and not letting them have due process or lawyers, they're allowed to spy on the lawyers once they get them, and they charge them with terrorism federally for spanking their children.
[03:04:20.646 --> 03:04:33.596]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember four years ago, Senator Menace, no pun intended, in Oregon introduced a bill, we have it posted, I forget the bill number, and it said, protesting without a permit, life in prison in a forced labor camp.
[03:04:35.495 --> 03:04:36.496]  I can pull that up for you.
[03:04:36.556 --> 03:04:38.597]  It says forced labor camp.
[03:04:38.857 --> 03:04:41.139]  It says downloading music illegally, forced labor camp.
[03:04:41.419 --> 03:04:42.380]  Then he got in all this trouble.
[03:04:42.420 --> 03:04:43.181]  It almost passed.
[03:04:43.201 --> 03:04:45.022]  It was in the Oregonian and AP.
[03:04:45.722 --> 03:04:48.624]  And then they introduced it in Rhode Island and other places, the exact same bill.
[03:04:49.205 --> 03:04:54.128]  And it said that if you disrespected the American flag, life in prison.
[03:04:55.149 --> 03:05:04.036]  And then it was in the... What's the main city of... It was in the NBC9 channel in...
[03:05:06.488 --> 03:05:32.287]  in Rhode Island and then it was also in the uh... a major paper and then the governor came out and said well the feds just told me to try to pass this so we're going to come back with these other PSAs and place them on myself on Russia Today and uh... continue with the analysis ladies and gentlemen I mean if you saw what I see studying this every day it is just we're being hit from every angle they are coming folks they've built death camps they're not joking around
[03:05:34.249 --> 03:05:37.250]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:05:38.170 --> 03:05:40.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:05:46.052 --> 03:05:51.373]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[03:05:51.813 --> 03:05:53.553]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[03:05:54.093 --> 03:05:55.574]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[03:05:56.234 --> 03:05:57.534]  Everyone needs something to get
[03:06:03.507 --> 03:06:04.428]  I don't know.
[03:06:14.787 --> 03:06:15.307]  We're good to go!
[03:06:43.922 --> 03:06:50.324]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:50.684 --> 03:06:52.665]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:53.325 --> 03:06:54.346]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:54.866 --> 03:06:55.386]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:55.686 --> 03:06:56.586]  This is his ammo.
[03:06:56.606 --> 03:06:57.947]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:57.967 --> 03:06:59.707]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:07:00.047 --> 03:07:06.770]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:07:07.170 --> 03:07:07.610]  Some U.S.
[03:07:07.650 --> 03:07:13.292]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:07:14.012 --> 03:07:17.493]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:07:17.513 --> 03:07:20.554]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:43.917 --> 03:07:45.418]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:07:45.598 --> 03:07:47.059]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:07:47.359 --> 03:07:49.581]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:07:50.041 --> 03:07:54.784]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:07:55.165 --> 03:07:58.006]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:07:58.367 --> 03:08:01.849]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[03:08:02.259 --> 03:08:14.245]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:08:14.806 --> 03:08:16.807]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:08:16.827 --> 03:08:18.127]  I use one every day.
[03:08:18.548 --> 03:08:20.989]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:08:21.229 --> 03:08:21.790]  We're good.
[03:08:49.488 --> 03:08:52.269]  Watching CNN, analyzing it right now on air.
[03:08:52.409 --> 03:08:56.011]  It is a giant parade to show you who's in charge.
[03:08:56.031 --> 03:08:59.673]  47,000 troops, regular army police in SWAT team outfits.
[03:09:01.434 --> 03:09:03.134]  They were just showing it on CNN during the break.
[03:09:03.274 --> 03:09:07.576]  Massive columns of troops, like a victory parade, like Hitler through Paris.
[03:09:10.043 --> 03:09:11.084]  Stomping, marching.
[03:09:11.364 --> 03:09:13.565]  Congress openly has been told they're under martial law.
[03:09:13.945 --> 03:09:15.125]  Senator Kennedy's collapsed.
[03:09:15.145 --> 03:09:17.326]  Senator Byrd's collapsed and have been taken to the hospital.
[03:09:18.427 --> 03:09:20.428]  All these ancient demonic crones of evil.
[03:09:21.808 --> 03:09:24.550]  Again, all of this to make you think Obama actually runs something.
[03:09:24.890 --> 03:09:29.772]  But now he actually will because they're fully empowering him to try to get mass group support.
[03:09:30.792 --> 03:09:36.175]  They've torn down our leaders, demonized them, and rightfully so, but not pointing out the elite control them.
[03:09:37.025 --> 03:09:42.932]  And then now they're finally doing nothing but lavish coverage and giving somebody to the public they can believe in.
[03:09:42.952 --> 03:09:46.676]  I mean, this is fully disgusting.
[03:09:46.696 --> 03:09:51.702]  And everyone's saluting the new Führer, who's promising he'll save them but giving no specifics.
[03:09:51.722 --> 03:09:55.246]  But when you read the fine print, total tyranny and darkness.
[03:09:58.936 --> 03:10:02.619]  Let's go ahead now and play the PSA with his wife.
[03:10:02.979 --> 03:10:06.501]  These are airing nationwide, everywhere, on every local channel, national.
[03:10:07.242 --> 03:10:09.924]  In the notice he says, there's going to be some painful stuff coming.
[03:10:10.344 --> 03:10:12.926]  It's going to get tough, but just stick with me.
[03:10:13.466 --> 03:10:15.127]  We'll take care of you if you do what we say.
[03:10:15.167 --> 03:10:15.768]  Here she is.
[03:10:18.850 --> 03:10:20.471]  Look how it all looks governmental, but it's not.
[03:10:24.016 --> 03:10:30.497]  Hi, I'm Michelle Obama, and I am so excited to talk with you today about our National Day of Service.
[03:10:31.318 --> 03:10:32.778]  January 19th... Hit pause!
[03:10:32.798 --> 03:10:33.818]  Hit pause!
[03:10:34.678 --> 03:10:35.119]  Back it up.
[03:10:35.159 --> 03:10:36.319]  I mean, just think about this.
[03:10:37.479 --> 03:10:42.500]  Tens of thousands of cases on record of people being arrested as terrorists for spatting their child.
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:44.621]  And for smoking pot.
[03:10:46.741 --> 03:10:48.382]  Just tens of thousands.
[03:10:48.542 --> 03:10:49.842]  Tens of thousands per state!
[03:10:51.172 --> 03:10:54.136]  I mean, I've seen the headlines, over 10,000 in the last two years in our state.
[03:10:54.998 --> 03:10:55.799]  That's one state!
[03:10:57.802 --> 03:11:00.886]  And they're going, oh hi, National Service, we want to help you.
[03:11:01.107 --> 03:11:03.631]  And the real thing, the main core is spy brigades.
[03:11:06.212 --> 03:11:07.252]  You can help America.
[03:11:07.312 --> 03:11:08.493]  We want to help America.
[03:11:09.033 --> 03:11:11.134]  It's going to get tough now, but just stick by us.
[03:11:11.154 --> 03:11:12.274]  You're part of our team.
[03:11:12.535 --> 03:11:13.635]  We want to help you.
[03:11:13.875 --> 03:11:15.296]  We don't work for the foreign bankers.
[03:11:15.596 --> 03:11:21.938]  We're not appointing all these IMF and World Bankers to run the administration like Geithner, Bilderberg group member, who doesn't even pay taxes.
[03:11:21.958 --> 03:11:22.719]  He's so elite.
[03:11:23.939 --> 03:11:24.759]  We love you.
[03:11:24.859 --> 03:11:25.260]  Here it is.
[03:11:25.500 --> 03:11:26.140]  Oh God, help me.
[03:11:26.505 --> 03:11:32.991]  Hi, I'm Michelle Obama, and I am so excited to talk with you today about our National Day of Service.
[03:11:33.832 --> 03:11:38.477]  January 19, the day before the inauguration, is Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:11:38.517 --> 03:11:38.737]  Day.
[03:11:38.797 --> 03:11:39.958]  Stop right there.
[03:11:39.978 --> 03:11:44.903]  Again, they connected to Martin Luther King and a true struggle for liberty and equality.
[03:11:45.784 --> 03:11:50.949]  When they're bringing in the opposite of that, taking that whole movement and just all psychological warfare, back to it!
[03:11:52.591 --> 03:11:59.241]  ...or a man who lived his life in service to others and showed us what we can accomplish when we stand together.
[03:11:59.261 --> 03:12:07.434]  Barack and I will spend the day volunteering right here in Washington, D.C., helping out in the community that we now call home.
[03:12:08.325 --> 03:12:13.769]  And we'd like you to join us and thousands of Americans across the country in this day of service.
[03:12:14.490 --> 03:12:19.494]  Please volunteer in your community as part of our Renew America Together initiative.
[03:12:20.194 --> 03:12:30.963]  To be a part of the National Day of Service, go to www.usaservice.org where you can sign up to join or host a service event in your community.
[03:12:30.983 --> 03:12:31.303]  Stop there!
[03:12:32.344 --> 03:12:53.423]  So what they get is all the regular good service, good hard work, and people who mean well to believe Obama's good, to join under their team, be under their control, and then they go, oh, by the way, we want you for youth brigades, we want you for environmental brigades, we want you for senior brigades, by the way, we're now starting forced 18 to 24, where you have to serve, and they'll have millions of people go, well, we serve voluntarily, you ought to do it, it's good!
[03:12:53.683 --> 03:12:54.504]  Soup kitchens!
[03:12:54.964 --> 03:12:59.148]  But it's a domestic security force as big and strong as the military in his own words.
[03:13:00.669 --> 03:13:05.476]  Rahm Emanuel writes a book as Chief of Staff saying you'll be forced to do it and gives TV interviews saying it.
[03:13:06.537 --> 03:13:08.500]  And they put it on change.gov as well.
[03:13:09.562 --> 03:13:10.263]  Let's go back to it.
[03:13:12.072 --> 03:13:12.853]  ...to do the same.
[03:13:13.754 --> 03:13:15.916]  This is more than just a single day of service.
[03:13:16.696 --> 03:13:25.624]  At usaservice.org, you can connect with people and groups in your area and continue serving in your community in the months and years ahead.
[03:13:26.385 --> 03:13:33.110]  Join people in every corner of the nation who are making an ongoing commitment to improving our communities and our country.
[03:13:33.951 --> 03:13:36.772]  We're about to face some major... Back it up.
[03:13:36.812 --> 03:13:39.214]  I was about to say she's about to say we're about to face some major challenges.
[03:13:39.354 --> 03:13:41.555]  Oh, it's gonna... Now, it's gonna get bad here.
[03:13:42.375 --> 03:13:47.057]  Again, making it all sound reasonable, making it sound nice, this is how they announce something horrible.
[03:13:47.077 --> 03:13:55.602]  When they come out and say they're gonna ban a bunch of guns, they don't say we're banning your guns because we want to enslave you and our own documents say we've got to be able to control you and we've got to have a monopoly of force to bring in tyranny.
[03:13:55.962 --> 03:13:57.983]  They say, oh, because the children get hurt.
[03:13:58.083 --> 03:13:59.944]  I mean, it's reasonable what we're doing.
[03:14:01.738 --> 03:14:02.539]  This is it, folks.
[03:14:02.579 --> 03:14:03.299]  This is D-Day.
[03:14:03.799 --> 03:14:06.281]  All the tyranny you've seen so far is the foundation.
[03:14:06.681 --> 03:14:08.382]  Now they're putting that pyramid capstone on.
[03:14:08.702 --> 03:14:09.223]  Back to it.
[03:14:10.203 --> 03:14:11.244]  Major challenges.
[03:14:11.844 --> 03:14:15.707]  And it's going to be up to all of us to renew America together.
[03:14:16.952 --> 03:14:25.679]  Inauguration Day is less than two weeks away and you can help us kick off the new administration with a spirit of national unity and shared commitment.
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:32.765]  Visit usaservice.org today and sign up to serve in your community on January 19th.
[03:14:33.626 --> 03:14:35.247]  We look forward to seeing you out there.
[03:14:35.928 --> 03:14:36.248]  Thank you.
[03:14:38.348 --> 03:14:40.429]  Now notice, there's no specifics.
[03:14:41.009 --> 03:14:42.510]  It's just sign up with us.
[03:14:43.151 --> 03:14:44.071]  Get on our list.
[03:14:44.131 --> 03:14:45.412]  We want to contact you.
[03:14:46.092 --> 03:14:47.693]  Hundreds of thousands have signed up in the last week.
[03:14:48.093 --> 03:14:49.214]  We want you to help.
[03:14:49.254 --> 03:14:50.855]  We're just going to help America, okay?
[03:14:51.195 --> 03:14:52.156]  We need unity.
[03:14:52.216 --> 03:14:54.317]  That means we need you to shut up and do what we say.
[03:14:54.337 --> 03:14:57.539]  We need you to smile and be fooled by us and feel good.
[03:14:58.599 --> 03:15:01.902]  And we all work for the big international foundations that are bringing down America.
[03:15:02.342 --> 03:15:05.204]  But we're not that big nasty George Bush, so everything's alright.
[03:15:05.825 --> 03:15:12.610]  Now go to the Hollywood people today, pledging to be slaves, pledging, whatever you say, whatever you do, we're going to do it.
[03:15:12.850 --> 03:15:14.511]  We're behind you, oh great Obama.
[03:15:15.112 --> 03:15:16.733]  Because we've got this national challenge.
[03:15:17.133 --> 03:15:20.236]  Oh, everything's imploding by the same bankers that are now fully taking over.
[03:15:21.904 --> 03:15:40.790]  Notice we're coming into office right when there's this big crisis, and we're going to have to do some things, and going to have to have voluntary and compulsory service, and we're going to have to spy on some people and arrest people for terrorism, for spanking their children, and ban most your guns, but we have to do it, and we have to attack Iran because we're liberal and we love you!
[03:15:41.130 --> 03:15:48.372]  The same George Bush agenda, which is the new old agenda, continuing accelerated with a fresh quarterback in the game, Barack Obama.
[03:15:49.724 --> 03:15:55.590]  The stunned dazed with multiple concussions, Bush taken off the field, and they send in Viper Command.
[03:15:56.011 --> 03:15:56.912]  Cobra Commander.
[03:15:56.932 --> 03:15:59.475]  Barack Obama.
[03:16:00.729 --> 03:16:02.950]  I mean, I'll never forget when I was in Denver.
[03:16:02.970 --> 03:16:04.031]  We saw him twice drive by.
[03:16:04.111 --> 03:16:05.232]  Police come by screaming.
[03:16:05.492 --> 03:16:07.193]  They block the roads off at Denver by the Convention Center.
[03:16:07.213 --> 03:16:11.255]  And all of a sudden, about two miles down, I roll through this big champagne-colored suburban.
[03:16:11.516 --> 03:16:12.896]  And the windows are clear.
[03:16:13.257 --> 03:16:14.918]  And there's her in the front and him in the back.
[03:16:15.478 --> 03:16:19.280]  And literally, it was like watching a Roman Caesar in those movies when they roll into Rome.
[03:16:20.461 --> 03:16:26.585]  And literally, literally, I mean, you see snobs in blue bloods and stuff, you know, where they're like this.
[03:16:28.444 --> 03:16:37.729]  He was literally, and I saw him going, as he rolls by for like 20 seconds, I'm watching this, at the red light, I'm in the front, I'm like, Rob, get your camera on that, and we got a little bit of it.
[03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:50.956]  We're reviewing that last night, and literally he's going, just doing an el duche, and I'm like, I mean, it's even, no one acts like that!
[03:16:50.996 --> 03:16:52.477]  This is classic tyranny!
[03:16:52.817 --> 03:16:54.378]  I mean, they even act just like it!
[03:16:54.438 --> 03:16:56.139]  I mean, it's just amazing!
[03:16:57.700 --> 03:16:58.941]  Oh God, help this country.
[03:16:59.201 --> 03:17:01.422]  I'm sorry the country killed 50 million babies with abortion.
[03:17:01.442 --> 03:17:02.363]  I'm sorry we're so evil.
[03:17:02.783 --> 03:17:04.264]  I'm sorry we killed all those Iraqis.
[03:17:05.165 --> 03:17:06.525]  You know, I fought against it.
[03:17:07.686 --> 03:17:08.507]  But I'm still culpable.
[03:17:08.527 --> 03:17:09.107]  I haven't done enough.
[03:17:09.167 --> 03:17:10.828]  I mean, we're all just being judged here, folks.
[03:17:10.848 --> 03:17:11.308]  This is it.
[03:17:11.849 --> 03:17:13.310]  The blind leading the blind, as they say.
[03:17:14.971 --> 03:17:16.131]  Now go to the Hollywood people.
[03:17:16.171 --> 03:17:16.972]  Let's go to this screen.
[03:17:17.552 --> 03:17:22.415]  The Hollywood people in a worship fest over here saying they'll do whatever they're told.
[03:17:22.435 --> 03:17:23.696]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:17:23.716 --> 03:17:24.076]  Here it is.
[03:17:26.457 --> 03:17:27.098]  Oh, sickening.
[03:17:28.712 --> 03:17:30.594]  Oh, look, it looks all presidential.
[03:17:31.615 --> 03:17:35.039]  Oh, it's our leader with the fascist colors and symbolism.
[03:17:35.079 --> 03:17:35.559]  The leader!
[03:17:36.020 --> 03:17:36.780]  Looking up, there he is.
[03:17:36.800 --> 03:17:42.446]  Oh, oh, so good.
[03:17:44.008 --> 03:17:45.209]  You're not alone.
[03:17:45.629 --> 03:17:46.791]  You're with us now.
[03:17:46.831 --> 03:17:49.634]  Let us summon a new spirit of patriotism,
[03:17:50.734 --> 03:17:58.519]  A responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.
[03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:00.761]  Hit pause.
[03:18:00.781 --> 03:18:01.401]  Hit pause.
[03:18:01.441 --> 03:18:01.802]  Back it up.
[03:18:01.842 --> 03:18:03.503]  And again, because they're going to rape you.
[03:18:03.523 --> 03:18:04.343]  You're going to lose your job.
[03:18:04.363 --> 03:18:06.385]  You're going to get a tiny government welfare check.
[03:18:06.605 --> 03:18:12.769]  They're going to branker up the society and then pose as the saviors, giving you the little government jobs and the tattletale squads.
[03:18:13.229 --> 03:18:18.173]  The military admits record people being recruited right now because they destroy the economy to bring you into the system.
[03:18:20.049 --> 03:18:22.131]  So no, hey, we gotta pitch in.
[03:18:22.171 --> 03:18:23.593]  Things are about to get real tough.
[03:18:24.934 --> 03:18:26.275]  And all of this was planned years ago.
[03:18:26.295 --> 03:18:27.396]  He's been pushing this rhetoric for years.
[03:18:27.436 --> 03:18:28.557]  It's all a program.
[03:18:28.818 --> 03:18:29.558]  It's all scripted.
[03:18:29.618 --> 03:18:30.059]  Back to it.
[03:18:35.740 --> 03:18:36.540]  I pledge.
[03:18:36.940 --> 03:18:37.741]  I pledge.
[03:18:37.961 --> 03:18:38.661]  I pledge.
[03:18:38.841 --> 03:18:40.362]  To help end hunger in America.
[03:18:40.562 --> 03:18:43.083]  By supporting Feeding America and our local food bank.
[03:18:43.123 --> 03:18:43.323]  I pledge.
[03:18:43.343 --> 03:18:43.563]  I pledge.
[03:18:43.583 --> 03:18:44.083]  To smile more.
[03:18:44.123 --> 03:18:44.443]  To laugh more.
[03:18:44.463 --> 03:18:44.903]  To love more.
[03:18:44.923 --> 03:18:45.223]  I pledge.
[03:18:45.243 --> 03:18:45.463]  I pledge.
[03:18:45.483 --> 03:18:45.663]  I pledge.
[03:18:45.683 --> 03:18:45.843]  I pledge.
[03:18:45.863 --> 03:18:46.023]  I pledge.
[03:18:46.044 --> 03:18:46.284]  I pledge.
[03:18:46.304 --> 03:18:46.544]  I pledge.
[03:18:46.564 --> 03:18:46.804]  I pledge.
[03:18:46.824 --> 03:18:47.064]  I pledge.
[03:18:47.084 --> 03:18:47.284]  I pledge.
[03:18:47.304 --> 03:18:47.584]  I pledge.
[03:18:47.904 --> 03:18:48.204]  I pledge.
[03:18:48.224 --> 03:18:48.544]  I pledge.
[03:18:48.564 --> 03:18:49.004]  I pledge.
[03:18:49.025 --> 03:18:49.345]  I pledge.
[03:18:49.365 --> 03:18:49.565]  I pledge.
[03:18:49.585 --> 03:18:49.745]  I pledge.
[03:18:49.785 --> 03:18:50.045]  I pledge.
[03:18:50.065 --> 03:18:50.325]  I pledge.
[03:18:50.345 --> 03:18:51.005]  I pledge.
[03:18:51.025 --> 03:18:51.345]  I pledge.
[03:18:51.365 --> 03:18:51.865]  I pledge.
[03:18:51.885 --> 03:18:52.146]  I pledge.
[03:18:52.166 --> 03:18:52.526]  I pledge.
[03:18:52.546 --> 03:18:52.786]  I pledge.
[03:18:52.826 --> 03:18:53.206]  I pledge.
[03:18:53.226 --> 03:18:53.446]  I pledge.
[03:18:53.466 --> 03:18:53.646]  I pledge.
[03:18:53.666 --> 03:18:53.906]  I pledge.
[03:18:53.926 --> 03:18:54.146]  I pledge.
[03:18:54.206 --> 03:18:54.406]  I pledge.
[03:18:54.426 --> 03:18:54.626]  I pledge.
[03:18:54.706 --> 03:18:54.987]  I pledge.
[03:18:55.007 --> 03:18:55.167]  I pledge.
[03:18:55.187 --> 03:18:55.447]  I pledge.
[03:18:55.667 --> 03:18:55.887]  I pledge.
[03:18:55.927 --> 03:18:56.147]  I pledge.
[03:18:56.167 --> 03:18:56.467]  I pledge.
[03:18:56.507 --> 03:18:56.747]  I pledge.
[03:18:56.767 --> 03:18:56.987]  I pledge.
[03:18:57.007 --> 03:18:57.627]  I pledge.
[03:18:57.647 --> 03:18:57.867]  I pledge.
[03:18:57.887 --> 03:18:58.108]  I pledge.
[03:18:58.128 --> 03:18:58.308]  I pledge.
[03:18:58.328 --> 03:18:58.568]  I pledge.
[03:18:58.588 --> 03:18:58.888]  I pledge.
[03:18:58.908 --> 03:18:59.128]  I pledge.
[03:18:59.148 --> 03:18:59.828]  I pledge.
[03:18:59.868 --> 03:19:00.128]  I pledge.
[03:19:00.148 --> 03:19:00.388]  I pledge.
[03:19:00.408 --> 03:19:00.688]  I pledge.
[03:19:00.708 --> 03:19:00.868]  I pledge.
[03:19:00.888 --> 03:19:01.189]  I pledge.
[03:19:01.209 --> 03:19:01.449]  I pledge.
[03:19:01.509 --> 03:19:01.789]  I pledge.
[03:19:01.829 --> 03:19:02.129]  I pledge.
[03:19:02.169 --> 03:19:02.429]  I pledge.
[03:19:02.449 --> 03:19:02.849]  I pledge.
[03:19:02.869 --> 03:19:03.049]  I pledge.
[03:19:03.089 --> 03:19:03.389]  I pledge
[03:19:05.925 --> 03:19:08.366]  See, I pledge, and I pledge to be smile.
[03:19:08.626 --> 03:19:09.707]  I pledge to be positive.
[03:19:10.067 --> 03:19:13.408]  This is World War II stuff out of Germany.
[03:19:13.628 --> 03:19:16.169]  I pledge to be happy in the homeland and fight!
[03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:18.731]  And people that aren't happy, they need to be arrested!
[03:19:18.871 --> 03:19:21.172]  Because it's their fault everything's falling apart!
[03:19:21.452 --> 03:19:28.375]  They had to get behind Obama, and because people didn't get behind Obama when he had a plan to save things, it's their fault everything's falling apart!
[03:19:28.415 --> 03:19:31.196]  It's not the bankers that run everything, they're loving and good too!
[03:19:31.776 --> 03:19:35.578]  Then we need to arrest anybody that criticizes the government because things are too damn tough!
[03:19:35.859 --> 03:19:40.121]  And the government says the only way to make things better is to get in line and smile!
[03:19:40.742 --> 03:19:41.402]  I'm smiling!
[03:19:41.662 --> 03:19:42.823]  You better be seen smiling in 1984!
[03:19:43.323 --> 03:19:44.724]  Oh, I love it!
[03:19:44.944 --> 03:19:46.025]  I love what's happening!
[03:19:46.065 --> 03:19:46.826]  Don't arrest me!
[03:19:47.486 --> 03:19:50.508]  Don't send me to the gulags they publicly built, the new archipelago!
[03:19:51.685 --> 03:20:02.437]  I pledge to smile more, to laugh more, to love more.
[03:20:02.917 --> 03:20:07.963]  I pledge to volunteer more of my time to help children battling serious illnesses.
[03:20:09.344 --> 03:20:14.889]  Yeah, will you volunteer your time organically to tell people there's mercury in the vaccines and cancer viruses?
[03:20:15.169 --> 03:20:19.633]  Will you get the sodium fluoride out of the water, which more than quadruples people's chance of getting bone cancer?
[03:20:19.893 --> 03:20:20.894]  Juvenile bone cancer?
[03:20:20.914 --> 03:20:21.334]  Google it!
[03:20:21.894 --> 03:20:22.995]  Thousands of scientific studies.
[03:20:23.616 --> 03:20:26.478]  No, see, it's all about, I love, I'm good, I volunteer.
[03:20:26.618 --> 03:20:32.883]  I go to this private website of the President to sign up to be his new MALCOR, with little red books.
[03:20:33.644 --> 03:20:34.764]  I mean, this is it, man.
[03:20:35.345 --> 03:20:37.245]  Webster Tarpley was more right than I even knew.
[03:20:37.286 --> 03:20:40.507]  I couldn't imagine, even myself, it would come this quick or be this bad.
[03:20:40.527 --> 03:20:41.207]  You understand that?
[03:20:42.668 --> 03:20:43.428]  Oh my God, help us.
[03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.789]  Oh my God.
[03:20:47.489 --> 03:20:47.989]  Back it up.
[03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:51.050]  And then, who could be against not helping?
[03:20:51.391 --> 03:20:55.552]  I pledge to help children that are sick and have bad medical illnesses.
[03:20:56.313 --> 03:20:59.994]  You know, all of a sudden, 50 years ago, it was like finding a leprechaun.
[03:21:00.014 --> 03:21:04.896]  It was so rare in a medical facility of child cancer, but now they're dying all over our streets and dying everywhere.
[03:21:05.736 --> 03:21:12.299]  I pledge to help them drink more fluoride and take more mercury shots and eat more GMO food when all the studies that kills the rats and monkeys that eat it.
[03:21:13.059 --> 03:21:17.001]  I pledge to be an idiot, dupe, and smile and go along with the genocide of the New World Order.
[03:21:18.257 --> 03:21:22.060]  Because people can't believe it's happening here, though it's the norm in every other nation, they can't.
[03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:25.022]  But in America, the tyranny is going to be bigger and better than anywhere else.
[03:21:25.962 --> 03:21:27.444]  Back to the mindless dupes.
[03:21:27.744 --> 03:21:29.545]  I pledge to be a great mother.
[03:21:29.725 --> 03:21:30.546]  To be a great father.
[03:21:30.566 --> 03:21:35.389]  To continue working with UNICEF to make this world a better place for all of us.
[03:21:35.409 --> 03:21:35.929]  Oh, UN!
[03:21:35.950 --> 03:21:37.050]  To be the voice for those in need.
[03:21:37.070 --> 03:21:39.032]  Hit pause, hit pause, back it up, 20 seconds.
[03:21:39.752 --> 03:21:40.273]  UNICEF.
[03:21:41.374 --> 03:21:52.200]  Obama has pledged to double the Planned Parenthood family planning funding for the United Nations in Africa and China and India, where they do forced abortions, forced infanticide, give them shots sterilizing them.
[03:21:52.380 --> 03:21:59.404]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Eugenics Society, Bill Gates' dad, head of the Planned Parenthood, all of this!
[03:22:00.044 --> 03:22:00.785]  See how it sounds good?
[03:22:00.825 --> 03:22:03.146]  I pledge for UNICEF!
[03:22:03.446 --> 03:22:04.647]  I help the children!
[03:22:06.601 --> 03:22:08.041]  You have no idea.
[03:22:08.662 --> 03:22:14.243]  Because you are weak-minded and because you're not an evil person, you can't imagine the evil.
[03:22:14.303 --> 03:22:15.183]  You don't know history.
[03:22:15.423 --> 03:22:19.084]  So this whole thing is a tapestry of propaganda.
[03:22:19.104 --> 03:22:23.406]  And at the end, it directs you at something that looks governmental and it's a private army.
[03:22:24.226 --> 03:22:24.686]  Back to it.
[03:22:26.347 --> 03:22:27.207]  To be a great father.
[03:22:27.568 --> 03:22:32.570]  To continue working with UNICEF to make this world a better place for all of our children.
[03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:34.991]  To be the voice for those that have no voice.
[03:22:35.411 --> 03:22:36.171]  I pledge.
[03:22:36.331 --> 03:22:36.931]  I pledge.
[03:22:37.252 --> 03:22:41.053]  To consider myself an American, not an African-American.
[03:22:41.173 --> 03:22:44.154]  To always represent my country with pride.
[03:22:45.635 --> 03:22:50.077]  Now they're ripping off John Wayne, who, you know, 30 years ago said, I'm not a hyphenated American.
[03:22:50.776 --> 03:22:54.618]  Because people want, I mean, in the name of multiculturalism, they've done studies, blacks don't even like that.
[03:22:54.638 --> 03:22:56.679]  They just want to be left alone and be part of society.
[03:22:56.940 --> 03:22:57.940]  Be seen as a normal person.
[03:22:58.440 --> 03:23:00.762]  But in the name of multiculturalism, they hype up the blackness.
[03:23:00.982 --> 03:23:02.043]  They hype up the whiteness.
[03:23:02.343 --> 03:23:04.244]  So see, now they're bringing in even conservatism.
[03:23:04.984 --> 03:23:07.486]  Of, hey, I'm not an African American, I'm an American!
[03:23:08.507 --> 03:23:11.210]  See how this, and I'm not even saying that's a bad thing, that's a good thing.
[03:23:11.490 --> 03:23:19.059]  But the point is, they're saying all these reasonable, great things, help children, feed the children, help sick children, but behind it all is an evil agenda.
[03:23:19.619 --> 03:23:25.346]  Because now they're selling you, this is the bait on the other line, the little juicy worm, that looks good, but there's a hook in it.
[03:23:26.380 --> 03:23:29.665]  And the hook is tyranny, FEMA camps being robbed, being looted.
[03:23:29.685 --> 03:23:31.066]  I mean, this is incredible!
[03:23:31.727 --> 03:23:34.411]  Classic, hardcore, Nazi-Soviet propaganda.
[03:23:34.451 --> 03:23:34.812]  Back to it.
[03:23:41.121 --> 03:23:44.885]  Always represent my country with pride, dignity, and honesty.
[03:23:45.045 --> 03:23:49.690]  I pledge to go to usaservice.org and find a service project that I am passionate about.
[03:23:49.991 --> 03:23:53.514]  I pledge allegiance to the funk, to the United Funk of Funkadelica.
[03:23:54.295 --> 03:23:58.440]  I pledge to never give anyone the finger when I'm driving again.
[03:23:58.803 --> 03:24:01.424]  To always find the humor in everything.
[03:24:01.444 --> 03:24:04.466]  I pledge to help find a cure for Alzheimer's.
[03:24:04.646 --> 03:24:06.427]  To care for America's elderly.
[03:24:06.447 --> 03:24:07.408]  Stop right there!
[03:24:07.888 --> 03:24:08.608]  Stop right there!
[03:24:08.628 --> 03:24:11.250]  The feds have passed the eugenics laws under bioethics.
[03:24:11.270 --> 03:24:15.612]  It's been in the Wall Street Journal where they're euthanizing people chained down, begging for food and water.
[03:24:16.823 --> 03:24:19.006]  We've listed their names, we've covered it ad nauseum.
[03:24:20.627 --> 03:24:23.351]  Right before that, she was saying that she... Back it up ten seconds.
[03:24:23.371 --> 03:24:24.872]  I forget what she was saying I wanted to comment on.
[03:24:26.074 --> 03:24:29.318]  You know, they're saying that they're pledging, but behind this is a whole evil agenda.
[03:24:29.338 --> 03:24:31.300]  That's how they con good people into working with them.
[03:24:31.320 --> 03:24:31.600]  Here it is.
[03:24:32.361 --> 03:24:34.523]  Find the humor in everything.
[03:24:34.863 --> 03:24:37.825]  I pledge to help find a cure for Alzheimer's.
[03:24:37.905 --> 03:24:38.886]  I pledge to care for America.
[03:24:39.186 --> 03:24:40.407]  A cure for Alzheimer's.
[03:24:41.088 --> 03:24:46.732]  We now have early onset at 25, 30, tens of thousands of people, they call it Alzheimer's.
[03:24:47.212 --> 03:24:49.194]  And they do the brain scans and all the research is there.
[03:24:49.514 --> 03:24:51.916]  It's aluminum, it's heavy metals, it's the mercury shots.
[03:24:52.437 --> 03:24:54.378]  Just Google, it's been all over even mainstream news.
[03:24:54.718 --> 03:24:58.921]  Three flu shots and you double your chance of Alzheimer's.
[03:24:59.994 --> 03:25:01.395]  They've had 20 year studies on this.
[03:25:02.235 --> 03:25:02.796]  Three of them.
[03:25:03.336 --> 03:25:07.839]  So you're going to tell somebody actually how to not get Alzheimer's where all these heavy metals go in as plaques in your brain?
[03:25:08.679 --> 03:25:09.940]  You're going to tell people about that?
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:28.292]  No, you're just going to, I pledge to give money to the military industrial complex that's launched this whole attack so they can use the money to pose and control the entire movement to make sure research doesn't really find out what's caused it or to make sure the public doesn't find out so they can control the poor pathetic victims so they never get together and actually cause a national movement to stop the eugenics attack.
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:30.681]  See how that works?
[03:25:31.982 --> 03:25:32.522]  I pledge.
[03:25:32.842 --> 03:25:33.803]  I pledge to be an idiot.
[03:25:34.083 --> 03:25:35.044]  I pledge to be shallow.
[03:25:35.264 --> 03:25:36.265]  I pledge to be kind.
[03:25:36.465 --> 03:25:37.566]  I pledge to be manipulated.
[03:25:37.626 --> 03:25:38.166]  Play the rest.
[03:25:38.787 --> 03:25:42.350]  To make sure that senior citizens have access to health care.
[03:25:42.390 --> 03:25:43.070]  Stop right there!
[03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:46.013]  That means access to federally controlled eugenics health care.
[03:25:46.033 --> 03:25:46.353]  Continue.
[03:25:48.513 --> 03:25:53.114]  ...to bring awareness to mental disease... ...to advance stem cell research... ...to spread the awareness... Stop that!
[03:25:53.194 --> 03:26:11.998]  Mental disease is the New Freedom Initiative, their own internal documents, released out of the New Freedom Initiative board in Pennsylvania by one of their own board members, that it's a plan to get half the public, instead of 20% of the public, on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other drugs, to list most Americans with mental illnesses, so that they can be institutionalized, even though they're out in public, so they can't own guns, so they can be part of the system.
[03:26:12.178 --> 03:26:15.599]  Can't get you on welfare, can't get you in the criminal justice system, can't get you in the psych system.
[03:26:15.919 --> 03:26:18.940]  See, just every point is an attack profile delta!
[03:26:19.740 --> 03:26:26.222]  And I refuse to go along with this, and I've seen through all of your lies, Barack Obama, you wicked, wicked devil!
[03:26:34.604 --> 03:26:36.485]  Let me see your war face for liberty!
[03:26:36.685 --> 03:26:42.306]  Let me hear that you're gonna stand up as a true organic resistance against these people for humanity!
[03:26:42.547 --> 03:26:43.667]  Stay with us!
[03:26:46.263 --> 03:26:56.354]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:26:56.835 --> 03:26:57.896]  Garden in a Can!

[03:27:50.731 --> 03:27:52.592]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:27:53.172 --> 03:27:55.914]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:27:56.214 --> 03:27:56.814]  It is essential
[03:27:58.527 --> 03:27:59.068]  We're good to go.

[03:30:40.104 --> 03:30:47.035]  The video is linked up on InfoWars.com that I did when I was off the air for 20-30 minutes when Rivero popped in and filled in.

[03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:57.010]  We're not the New World Order.
[03:30:57.030 --> 03:31:01.691]  We don't have trillions of dollars of funds, but look what we've done with the money we've had, the support we've had.

[03:31:09.833 --> 03:31:15.294]  You know, this is not an official plug today, because I'm going to get to that tomorrow, but we've got a new sponsor that's here in Central Texas.
[03:31:16.274 --> 03:31:17.855]  They've got these big rainwater collectors.
[03:31:17.995 --> 03:31:20.735]  It's some of the best tasting bottled water I've ever drunk, drank.
[03:31:21.056 --> 03:31:23.396]  And then it's reverse osmosis after that.
[03:31:24.677 --> 03:31:26.497]  And it's PureRainUSA.com.
[03:31:26.537 --> 03:31:29.218]  They're looking for distributors across the country in Central Texas.
[03:31:29.918 --> 03:31:30.699]  And they're patriots.

[03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:37.861]  That's a new sponsor coming up.
[03:31:38.141 --> 03:31:41.942]  It's up on the screen, but I'm going to get to their plug tomorrow because we're just out of time on the main broadcast.
[03:31:42.402 --> 03:31:44.143]  Also, another one of our sponsors.
[03:31:45.063 --> 03:31:52.205]  That makes so much of what we are doing here possible is the seed companies.
[03:31:53.265 --> 03:31:57.146]  And I just hope that folks will check them out and get involved with them.
[03:31:57.206 --> 03:32:00.467]  One of them is survivalseedbank.com 877-327-0365.
[03:32:02.187 --> 03:32:08.289]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[03:32:08.329 --> 03:32:12.010]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds had a higher value
[03:32:13.351 --> 03:32:13.531]  I think?
[03:32:29.551 --> 03:32:30.652]  Why do you think this is?
[03:32:31.272 --> 03:32:31.832]  You know why.
[03:32:31.892 --> 03:32:32.813]  Control and power.

[03:32:38.036 --> 03:32:39.476]  One seed bank at a time.

[03:32:56.126 --> 03:32:56.987]  877-327-0365.
[03:32:57.627 --> 03:33:02.691]  Okay, folks.
[03:33:03.892 --> 03:33:05.353]  Again, an amazing broadcast today.
[03:33:05.393 --> 03:33:06.694]  I've gotten fired up and upset.
[03:33:07.034 --> 03:33:08.536]  If you're not upset by the L.A.
[03:33:08.576 --> 03:33:13.059]  Times, in this article going, well, it's reasonable.
[03:33:13.099 --> 03:33:14.460]  It's what we do to fight terrorists.
[03:33:14.540 --> 03:33:15.821]  It's what we've got to do for security.
[03:33:18.211 --> 03:33:21.034]  Hundreds and hundreds of people arrested for spatting their children.
[03:33:21.054 --> 03:33:21.895]  Their children are fighting.
[03:33:21.915 --> 03:33:23.236]  The woman spats them on the leg.
[03:33:23.597 --> 03:33:25.038]  She gets charged with terrorism.
[03:33:25.078 --> 03:33:26.840]  Doesn't get to have due process.
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:29.623]  Gets held for three months, forcibly, to make her plead guilty.
[03:33:29.983 --> 03:33:31.645]  And the article goes on to say that's good.
[03:33:33.991 --> 03:33:38.614]  You know, it's just basically just conditioning everybody to accept all of this.
[03:33:38.634 --> 03:33:41.916]  I mean, I've got hundreds of these articles here in front of me.
[03:33:41.956 --> 03:33:49.320]  Now, when the main Genesis broadcast ends in T-minus 45 seconds, I will still be on air, but only one place.
[03:33:49.360 --> 03:33:53.783]  The Infowars.com audio streams and the video of the live TV transmission.
[03:33:53.803 --> 03:33:54.943]  We've been live for three hours today.
[03:33:55.884 --> 03:33:59.806]  Rod Paul is coming up in the rebroadcast in the next hour, so I'm going to do about 15-20 minutes.
[03:34:01.047 --> 03:34:01.868]  Take your phone calls.
[03:34:01.888 --> 03:34:06.291]  The number for the listeners that are on hold to call is 888-201-2244.
[03:34:06.311 --> 03:34:08.332]  888-201-2244.
[03:34:08.353 --> 03:34:09.814]  888-201-2244.
[03:34:11.835 --> 03:34:12.416]  You guys call.
[03:34:12.456 --> 03:34:13.396]  Get to your calls right now.
[03:34:13.416 --> 03:34:14.717]  Hit some final issues.
[03:34:14.737 --> 03:34:15.458]  Put a little bit of rush.
[03:34:15.498 --> 03:34:18.340]  Today I was on the MLN transmission that's live.
[03:34:18.380 --> 03:34:23.384]  It'll go to Ron Paul coming up in T-minus 40 minutes from today.
[03:34:23.404 --> 03:34:24.024]  It was incredible.
[03:34:24.144 --> 03:34:27.026]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:34:28.266 --> 03:34:31.629]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:34:33.790 --> 03:34:35.372]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:34:35.492 --> 03:34:38.414]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[03:34:38.454 --> 03:34:40.215]  And today that's more important than ever.
[03:34:40.235 --> 03:34:42.998]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[03:34:43.198 --> 03:34:46.060]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:50.964]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:34:51.304 --> 03:34:53.768]  Okay, we'll cut that Genesis feed.
[03:34:54.068 --> 03:34:56.391]  And we'll go into overdrive right now.
[03:35:08.507 --> 03:35:10.748]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:35:10.968 --> 03:35:17.029]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:35:17.229 --> 03:35:20.970]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:35:21.010 --> 03:35:22.330]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:35:22.350 --> 03:35:22.930]  Take action today.
[03:35:22.970 --> 03:35:24.791]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:35:35.575 --> 03:35:38.617]  Just saw a key article up on PrisonPlanet.com, you saw it on the screen.
[03:35:38.998 --> 03:35:40.559]  Gun control efforts on the horizon.
[03:35:40.659 --> 03:35:41.620]  Massive bills hitting.
[03:35:41.660 --> 03:35:42.300]  It's all happening.
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:44.742]  We've got to gear up and fight back against that and a lot more.
[03:35:45.443 --> 03:35:49.426]  I want to go to your calls here for folks that are patiently holding.
[03:35:49.466 --> 03:35:51.607]  We'll go to those here in just a few minutes.
[03:35:51.667 --> 03:35:53.209]  Have we opened the phone system up for folks yet?
[03:35:54.810 --> 03:35:55.390]  Fantastic.
[03:35:55.410 --> 03:35:57.612]  We'll be going to those callers that we're holding here in a moment.
[03:35:57.632 --> 03:36:04.998]  I want to talk about what we've done just for a few minutes, kind of a state of the union here in the InfoWar bunker in the command center.
[03:36:06.206 --> 03:36:13.029]  We've moved out of a 2,000-foot building, 2,000-square-foot building, and a 2,400-square-foot building.
[03:36:13.069 --> 03:36:16.791]  We have two into one 8,000-square-foot.
[03:36:16.891 --> 03:36:18.652]  It's like 9,800-something feet building.
[03:36:20.833 --> 03:36:23.594]  We have built this studio on the cheap, but it still costs about $100,000.
[03:36:26.107 --> 03:36:27.668]  You know, the light package is $5,000.
[03:36:28.248 --> 03:36:30.029]  The cameras are each about $6,000 a piece.
[03:36:30.489 --> 03:36:35.332]  The switcher is $20,000 with the video computer and the robotic cameras.
[03:36:36.392 --> 03:36:39.294]  You can't have a TV studio with people inside the studio.
[03:36:39.354 --> 03:36:39.974]  It's this small.
[03:36:41.235 --> 03:36:44.697]  We're building another little studio out there, but we don't have the capital to do that.
[03:36:46.445 --> 03:36:50.087]  Well, I may be able to do it on the Super Chiefs and just have something behind me and do it.
[03:36:50.327 --> 03:36:52.468]  We want to make it look pretty good because a lot of it is presentation.
[03:36:53.168 --> 03:36:59.131]  We've upgraded the servers from PrisonPlanet.tv to CDNs at a cost of around $10,000 more a month just for that.
[03:37:00.512 --> 03:37:02.333]  We've hired three more people.
[03:37:03.592 --> 03:37:12.942]  We're trying to hire eight more, but two of them are going to be salesmen, so those don't have to be funded by the video sales and things I'm doing.
[03:37:13.943 --> 03:37:16.485]  But we have expanded.
[03:37:16.525 --> 03:37:18.427]  We've made the websites better, more interactive.
[03:37:19.529 --> 03:37:21.230]  We are just doing things on every front.
[03:37:21.250 --> 03:37:22.371]  I've started an audio blog.
[03:37:24.246 --> 03:37:31.092]  We are going to be expanding a special newscast I'm going to do each day for PrisonPlanet.tv members, a quick five-minute news blitz.
[03:37:31.592 --> 03:37:36.596]  I'm going to try to bring some other news presenters in here to cover the alternative news.
[03:37:37.637 --> 03:37:39.999]  We are doing it all here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:40.039 --> 03:37:46.044]  We are fighting to get as much information out as we can to the public.
[03:37:53.151 --> 03:37:54.131]  Can you guys bring me a phone?
[03:37:54.151 --> 03:37:54.611]  Let's hear it.
[03:37:54.651 --> 03:37:55.532]  Punch it up on the computer.
[03:37:55.572 --> 03:37:55.892]  Thank you.
[03:37:56.412 --> 03:37:57.172]  So I know who to go to.
[03:37:57.192 --> 03:37:58.092]  Thanks.
[03:37:59.913 --> 03:38:00.933]  I am busting my butt.
[03:38:01.153 --> 03:38:05.314]  I have... Let's just say this.
[03:38:05.354 --> 03:38:05.894]  I work a lot.
[03:38:08.275 --> 03:38:09.575]  And I wish I could work more.
[03:38:09.595 --> 03:38:10.815]  I wish my body had more energy.
[03:38:10.835 --> 03:38:13.156]  I wish my adrenal glands had more juice.
[03:38:17.176 --> 03:38:22.861]  But I'm fighting as hard as I can, and I realize that capital, money coming in here, will make it a little bit easier for me to do that.
[03:38:22.901 --> 03:38:29.707]  But I need to hire people to help me, and to hire the overstretched staff, the limited folks that I have in here as well.
[03:38:31.629 --> 03:38:37.334]  So again, we do need your support, and so please buy the books and videos, please buy the materials off the websites, do whatever you can.
[03:38:39.015 --> 03:38:43.179]  I will be going to your phone calls coming up here in just a few minutes.
[03:38:47.256 --> 03:38:51.199]  I will continue to break down Barack Obama's real agenda.
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:53.361]  Let's just say this, it's worse than I even thought it would be.
[03:38:53.822 --> 03:39:01.088]  It's more over-the-top, Hitlerian, Orwellian, Stalinist, Maoist than I could have even envisioned.
[03:39:01.508 --> 03:39:05.992]  It's more out front, it's more competent, it's more focused than we've seen from government.
[03:39:07.393 --> 03:39:14.960]  It is so classically off the charts, wicked and corrupt and bad, and so sicky sweet and lying on the surface about what it's really about.
[03:39:16.147 --> 03:39:22.132]  That it just shakes me to my very core.
[03:39:22.813 --> 03:39:28.578]  But it shakes me awake even more to stand up and fight back against these people and to resist.
[03:39:29.118 --> 03:39:31.660]  You guys can just write the callers on a piece of paper and give them to me.
[03:39:31.680 --> 03:39:32.281]  I'll just do that.
[03:39:32.301 --> 03:39:35.984]  I do everything I can
[03:39:43.416 --> 03:39:46.937]  I fight as hard as I can, and I'm not whining.
[03:39:47.037 --> 03:39:48.978]  I'm saying we just need to do more.
[03:39:49.018 --> 03:39:49.758]  We need to be focused.
[03:39:49.778 --> 03:39:56.261]  See, they're trying to organize people and organize the grassroots to get behind government and these private banks that have hijacked it to do all these horrible things.
[03:39:56.321 --> 03:39:57.521]  They know they need people power.
[03:39:57.561 --> 03:39:58.922]  We have the organic people power.
[03:39:59.142 --> 03:40:06.425]  We have a population, the majority, that knows what's going on, but they have a huge cadre that means well and is dumbed down and will go along with all this hellish stuff.
[03:40:07.365 --> 03:40:11.887]  And, you know, this nightmare just somehow has got to stop and has got to end.
[03:40:15.157 --> 03:40:16.157]  And so that's the bottom line.
[03:40:16.177 --> 03:40:17.558]  I want to go to Cheryl in France.
[03:40:17.578 --> 03:40:23.060]  We're going to go ahead and go to Cheryl in... Okay, Cheryl in France dropped off.
[03:40:23.740 --> 03:40:24.721]  Missed that new caller.
[03:40:27.542 --> 03:40:28.142]  Missed that again.
[03:40:30.303 --> 03:40:31.863]  Brian in Iowa, you're on the air.
[03:40:33.084 --> 03:40:33.704]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:40:33.824 --> 03:40:40.767]  I'm doing what I can to fort tyranny here in Iowa in the 1st District and keep the Chicago political machine from getting across the Mississippi here.
[03:40:41.842 --> 03:40:46.245]  I'm calling today the Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution.
[03:40:47.266 --> 03:40:52.529]  It says that before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation.
[03:40:52.690 --> 03:41:05.578]  I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[03:41:06.119 --> 03:41:08.000]  Well, that's not what Barack Obama said today.
[03:41:10.750 --> 03:41:14.853]  You know, I didn't watch the whole speech except during breaks because I was live on air.
[03:41:14.913 --> 03:41:17.534]  This sounds like a major controversy and very serious issue.
[03:41:17.854 --> 03:41:19.315]  What specifically did he say?
[03:41:19.335 --> 03:41:29.741]  Specifically what he said is, he said, I do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of President of the United States faithfully.
[03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:40.194]  Now, the Chief Justice, he was leading the oath, and the arguments that I've been getting so far is that, well, the Chief Justice let him arrive, but this is our President, right?
[03:41:40.214 --> 03:41:41.934]  This is the great, mighty Obama.
[03:41:41.954 --> 03:41:44.015]  Shouldn't he be able to take the oath properly?
[03:41:44.175 --> 03:41:45.516]  Hold on, this is huge news.
[03:41:45.896 --> 03:41:47.937]  I want you guys to dial Paul Watson.
[03:41:47.957 --> 03:41:49.978]  This is an emergency transmission.
[03:41:49.998 --> 03:41:50.978]  I want to hold you.
[03:41:50.998 --> 03:41:53.199]  We can put two callers on at the same time on our system, right?
[03:41:53.619 --> 03:41:55.460]  I want you to call Paul Watson now.
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:41:58.441]  I want to get this fellow online, I believe you.
[03:41:59.301 --> 03:42:01.561]  This is a huge issue in ceremony.
[03:42:01.601 --> 03:42:02.902]  They practice it for days.
[03:42:03.302 --> 03:42:07.563]  If you're telling me that he administered the oath incorrectly... Absolutely.
[03:42:07.623 --> 03:42:09.923]  I clipped it together if you want to look at it.
[03:42:09.983 --> 03:42:12.003]  I'm not trying to plug a clip or anything.
[03:42:12.243 --> 03:42:13.184]  No, plug your website!
[03:42:14.884 --> 03:42:18.264]  I'm up as Benatorious Iowa on YouTube.
[03:42:18.284 --> 03:42:21.945]  I just punch in, did Obama take the oath properly?
[03:42:21.965 --> 03:42:22.505]  No, you're right.
[03:42:22.565 --> 03:42:23.745]  It says Star Tribune.
[03:42:23.885 --> 03:42:24.626]  Oath of Office.
[03:42:24.946 --> 03:42:25.206]  Oops.
[03:42:25.246 --> 03:42:26.126]  See how great my team is?
[03:42:27.566 --> 03:42:31.749]  It says, you couldn't help but cringe when the President's oath of office was administered today.
[03:42:31.769 --> 03:42:37.892]  It started off with an awkward interruption, then came another pause and a wordless exchange while Obama and U.S.
[03:42:37.932 --> 03:42:42.975]  Supreme Court Justice John Roberts figured out that a word or two had been misplaced in the oath.
[03:42:43.475 --> 03:42:43.716]  Oh!
[03:42:44.196 --> 03:42:45.257]  But they didn't re-administer it.
[03:42:45.297 --> 03:42:46.817]  Guys, I'll guarantee you,
[03:42:48.018 --> 03:42:49.859]  Obama's oath of office is going to be all over the web.
[03:42:49.939 --> 03:42:51.860]  Go to YouTube, find one that's like 30 seconds long.
[03:42:52.161 --> 03:42:52.801]  That'll be it.
[03:42:52.921 --> 03:42:55.563]  Because there'll be longer ones that are the whole, you know, the whole ceremony.
[03:42:56.323 --> 03:42:57.344]  This is so important.
[03:42:57.944 --> 03:42:59.485]  This is law.
[03:42:59.525 --> 03:43:00.245]  This is under law.
[03:43:00.305 --> 03:43:01.626]  So it means he isn't the president.
[03:43:01.986 --> 03:43:06.749]  See how everything he does... Listen, they're practicing that he's probably not from America.
[03:43:07.650 --> 03:43:09.531]  That they won't bring the real forward, the real birth
[03:43:09.591 --> 03:43:10.411]  We're good to go.
[03:43:33.666 --> 03:43:45.872]  That's Obama, said I will execute faithfully the office of the President of the United States, Obama, the office of the President of the United States faithfully, Roberts, and will to the best of my ability, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[03:43:46.152 --> 03:43:47.672]  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[03:43:47.932 --> 03:43:49.093]  So help me God, so help me God.
[03:43:49.413 --> 03:43:52.875]  So he did, here's the key part, so I do solemnly swear, Roberts,
[03:43:53.755 --> 03:43:59.756]  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of President to the United States faithfully, that I will execute.
[03:44:00.017 --> 03:44:03.337]  He didn't say that I will execute the office of the President to the United States faithfully.
[03:44:03.357 --> 03:44:04.678]  He said I will execute.
[03:44:11.159 --> 03:44:14.340]  Sir, you're welcome to plug your website.
[03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:14.720]  Where is it?
[03:44:15.666 --> 03:44:20.027]  I don't have a website, it's just a clip that I threw together on YouTube.
[03:44:20.367 --> 03:44:20.908]  What's it named?
[03:44:21.948 --> 03:44:26.529]  It's named, Did Obama Take the Oath Properly?
[03:44:26.989 --> 03:44:28.490]  Alright, Did Obama Take the Oath Properly?
[03:44:28.530 --> 03:44:29.210]  Thank you for the call.
[03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:31.250]  Just amazing callers.
[03:44:31.951 --> 03:44:37.132]  Up next, my call screen went down here, and we're still beta testing the studio, working it all out.
[03:44:38.132 --> 03:44:39.953]  Tristan in Florida, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:44:40.922 --> 03:44:43.183]  Hi Alex, good afternoon.
[03:44:43.243 --> 03:44:45.124]  I'm here in Central Town Zone as well.
[03:44:45.444 --> 03:44:53.028]  I discovered you about four years ago after doing an independent study on this guy Donald Rumsfeld, and I came across you.
[03:44:53.048 --> 03:44:55.729]  It's been a lot of wealth and knowledge ever since.
[03:44:55.789 --> 03:45:01.292]  I got three points right quick that I'd like to... Well, one question and two points.
[03:45:02.593 --> 03:45:04.954]  My first point is about
[03:45:06.286 --> 03:45:09.752]  King Solomon saying that nothing is new under the sun, you with me?
[03:45:10.173 --> 03:45:11.095]  Yes.
[03:45:12.637 --> 03:45:17.085]  One being, you remember the story of Nebuchadnezzar and the three Hebrew boys?
[03:45:18.252 --> 03:45:21.456]  Um, Daniel's friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[03:45:21.777 --> 03:45:22.057]  Yes.
[03:45:22.357 --> 03:45:29.085]  And Nebuchadnezzar passed a decree after he built the, um... They had to bow down.
[03:45:29.105 --> 03:45:31.208]  They all had to pray to him and they said no.
[03:45:32.129 --> 03:45:32.470]  Right.
[03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:37.295]  And whoever did not bow down to it, he passed a decree that many nations
[03:45:37.996 --> 03:45:44.598]  And anyone that didn't bow down when the trumpets were blown and different instruments played, there were consequences for that.
[03:45:45.018 --> 03:45:46.039]  You know, death.
[03:45:46.359 --> 03:45:48.920]  So, there's nothing new under the sun.
[03:45:49.160 --> 03:45:52.561]  And what we see in the past will repeat itself.
[03:45:52.861 --> 03:45:56.662]  And these things are eminent.
[03:45:56.702 --> 03:45:58.563]  These things are coming down the line.
[03:45:58.663 --> 03:46:01.384]  So, people need to pay attention to those things.
[03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:07.313]  My second point is something I want to commend you on is courage.
[03:46:07.953 --> 03:46:12.176]  And, you know, the definition of courage is, you know, it's not about being afraid.
[03:46:12.477 --> 03:46:15.959]  You know, courage is acting even when you are afraid.
[03:46:16.400 --> 03:46:20.843]  You know, being, going forth and doing what you have to do even in the face of fear.
[03:46:21.283 --> 03:46:25.086]  You know, and that's what we need to have in these times is courage.
[03:46:25.426 --> 03:46:28.769]  I don't want people to be afraid of these things that's going to come.
[03:46:28.789 --> 03:46:32.672]  They should be afraid of not fighting back and letting this evil win.
[03:46:34.311 --> 03:46:36.493]  You know what it is, Alex?
[03:46:36.973 --> 03:46:45.279]  I work with juvenile offenders and I tell them all the time, when you can't control the situation, the only thing you can control is yourself, you know?
[03:46:45.720 --> 03:46:59.590]  And they're gonna do what they're gonna do, the elitists are gonna do what they're gonna do, this was a great strategy in bringing Barack in, you know, the blacks for the blacks, and I'm of African descent, you know, but
[03:47:00.170 --> 03:47:07.136]  I feel that, you know, knowing the black community, there's nothing that this guy's going to be able to do wrong, you know?
[03:47:07.576 --> 03:47:10.319]  Because that's the first black president, you know?
[03:47:10.699 --> 03:47:12.120]  Same thing with the white yuppies.
[03:47:12.921 --> 03:47:22.729]  And I understand that, but we have to, you know, like I always tell people that when they look at our geniuses, they set Obama up against Bush, of course you're going to go with Obama.
[03:47:23.573 --> 03:47:23.853]  Yeah!
[03:47:24.133 --> 03:47:32.379]  You know, I mean, the Bush administration terrorized this for so long, you know, of course, anything other than Bush, people gladly accept.
[03:47:32.399 --> 03:47:33.941]  You know how this works?
[03:47:33.961 --> 03:47:34.701]  I'm going to draw a picture.
[03:47:34.721 --> 03:47:36.983]  And then I'm going to go back to you and let you finish up, Tristan.
[03:47:37.763 --> 03:47:38.084]  Thank you.
[03:47:38.464 --> 03:47:41.126]  Okay, let's... Give me a close-up.
[03:47:41.306 --> 03:47:44.668]  I'm going to draw a picture of the folks that are watching.
[03:47:45.609 --> 03:47:47.831]  I'm going to get a document cam in the ceiling soon.
[03:47:47.851 --> 03:47:52.334]  It's going to be hard to draw this upside down, so I'm just going to draw it and then hold it up.
[03:47:54.713 --> 03:47:56.574]  Okay, let's say this is woods.
[03:47:57.295 --> 03:47:57.595]  Okay?
[03:47:58.176 --> 03:47:58.976]  Here are the woods.
[03:47:59.977 --> 03:48:04.841]  Here are the woods, and there are pheasant birds in the woods.
[03:48:05.921 --> 03:48:06.662]  These are birds.
[03:48:07.362 --> 03:48:13.027]  Now, how do the British, and all cultures have done this, to hunt elephants, you know, I mean, any animals.
[03:48:13.767 --> 03:48:15.809]  They beat on drums and pots and pans.
[03:48:16.289 --> 03:48:17.110]  The servants do.
[03:48:18.090 --> 03:48:20.612]  The people behind the birds.
[03:48:22.193 --> 03:48:23.875]  And they beat on these pots and pans.
[03:48:25.094 --> 03:48:25.674]  Let me close up.
[03:48:25.694 --> 03:48:27.616]  Okay, I want to show people this.
[03:48:29.177 --> 03:48:29.938]  Here are the people.
[03:48:30.318 --> 03:48:31.639]  They beat on pots and pans.
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:33.161]  Here are the birds, the pheasants.
[03:48:33.621 --> 03:48:34.802]  In England, this is how the queen hunts.
[03:48:35.903 --> 03:48:36.904]  It's an ancient form of hunting.
[03:48:37.264 --> 03:48:38.505]  They beat on the pots and pans.
[03:48:38.945 --> 03:48:40.467]  You'll have 50 acres of woods.
[03:48:41.668 --> 03:48:46.071]  And for hours, the people will march through the woods, beating the pots and pans in a big crescent.
[03:48:46.752 --> 03:48:48.053]  It'll be a big crescent.
[03:48:49.358 --> 03:49:14.159]  of people closing in and then as they get in they'll start closing the crescent as they walk miles of the woods beating the pots and pans and all the animals and all the deer and all the prey will get closed up as they go through the woods and then they'll start closing it out to where when they come out of the woods all of the birds
[03:49:16.437 --> 03:49:19.559]  And the deer and everything else they might want to be hunting, but generally it's just birds.
[03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:28.963]  They, who were all spread out in the woods, they will come out in one little group, over just a hundred yards or so, hundreds of pheasants flying out.
[03:49:30.244 --> 03:49:35.267]  Okay, now George Bush and the tyranny and the corruption, he's the guys beating the bushes.
[03:49:36.274 --> 03:49:37.475]  That's the term, beating the bushes.
[03:49:38.375 --> 03:49:45.239]  He's the guy making the noise, being tyrannical, admitting they're torturing, saying they're above the law, saying they're God, launching all these wars.
[03:49:45.259 --> 03:49:47.140]  They drive us, the pheasants, into the woods.
[03:49:47.980 --> 03:49:49.681]  They start closing the gap on us with Bush.
[03:49:49.701 --> 03:49:50.542]  Everybody gets scared.
[03:49:50.582 --> 03:49:51.402]  The recession starts.
[03:49:51.442 --> 03:49:52.283]  The depression starts.
[03:49:53.443 --> 03:49:54.484]  Everybody's freaking out.
[03:49:55.776 --> 03:50:00.399]  And then when they come out of the woods, we're all together running from George Bush and the New World Order.
[03:50:00.659 --> 03:50:03.021]  He's got a, you know, 9% approval rating in Congress.
[03:50:03.361 --> 03:50:04.182]  Everybody's waking up.
[03:50:04.202 --> 03:50:06.263]  They know the government's evil, and they want a savior.
[03:50:06.323 --> 03:50:07.203]  They want the open air.
[03:50:07.244 --> 03:50:09.145]  They want to get out of the woods and get away from this threat.
[03:50:09.485 --> 03:50:11.386]  And Barack Obama is coming out of the woods.
[03:50:11.426 --> 03:50:17.991]  Barack Obama is waiting right here with his people, with their guns.
[03:50:20.993 --> 03:50:21.333]  Okay?
[03:50:21.753 --> 03:50:22.894]  In fact, they've got a big cannon.
[03:50:24.246 --> 03:50:24.966]  Pointed right at him.
[03:50:25.346 --> 03:50:26.127]  With birdshot.
[03:50:27.547 --> 03:50:27.987]  Boom.
[03:50:29.208 --> 03:50:30.048]  Boom, boom, boom.
[03:50:30.068 --> 03:50:30.689]  You see right here?
[03:50:30.729 --> 03:50:32.289]  This is very primitive drawing, but look.
[03:50:33.650 --> 03:50:35.830]  So George Bush, he's evil, he's bad, we know he's bad.
[03:50:35.891 --> 03:50:36.971]  Oh my God, the media admits it.
[03:50:37.011 --> 03:50:37.851]  Oh my God, what are we going to do?
[03:50:37.891 --> 03:50:38.492]  Total tyranny?
[03:50:38.772 --> 03:50:40.232]  But you know, he's doing it for our best interest still.
[03:50:41.033 --> 03:50:41.793]  They close it up.
[03:50:42.153 --> 03:50:43.393]  Oh my gosh, we've got to get away from George Bush.
[03:50:43.413 --> 03:50:44.794]  Oh look, Barack Obama, he'll fix it all.
[03:50:45.034 --> 03:50:49.676]  We come running out, and there they are, firing on us.
[03:50:50.616 --> 03:50:52.017]  As we run right into their hands.
[03:50:53.444 --> 03:50:54.384]  That's the bait and switch.
[03:50:54.424 --> 03:50:55.645]  That's the good cop, bad cop.
[03:50:56.505 --> 03:51:01.446]  But, these guys work with these guys, and these guys work with these guys.
[03:51:01.886 --> 03:51:05.227]  And we, the American people, the people of the world, we're in the woods.
[03:51:05.307 --> 03:51:05.887]  We're the pheasants.
[03:51:06.207 --> 03:51:11.908]  How about we figure out the scam and we just go into the woods and live our lives and not let them corral us with fake terrorism.
[03:51:12.128 --> 03:51:13.049]  That's another form of this.
[03:51:13.449 --> 03:51:14.329]  Scaring us with fake terror.
[03:51:14.609 --> 03:51:16.089]  Scaring us with economic collapse.
[03:51:16.410 --> 03:51:22.211]  Driving us into the hands of the queen, of the boss, of the kingpins that ran the whole scam.
[03:51:23.712 --> 03:51:24.533]  You understand that, Fox?
[03:51:25.233 --> 03:51:31.178]  Yes, Alex, I tell people this story all the time and I equate it to this, you know, Barack thing.
[03:51:32.019 --> 03:51:37.724]  Once when I was in high school, I was robbed by a guy who came across me very nicely.
[03:51:38.104 --> 03:51:42.488]  You know, he was working with another guy, you know, and he came, hey man, you alright?
[03:51:42.989 --> 03:51:49.114]  Bam, you know, and he came across very nicely and ended up that he was working with the other guy too.
[03:51:49.821 --> 03:51:59.186]  You know, so we can't be fooled by the smiling face and someone seems to be working in your favor when all the while, you know, they're trying to set you up for the okey-doke.
[03:51:59.506 --> 03:52:11.532]  You know, and a lot of people have got off the phone with me because, you know, my friends and family, they hang up the phone on me or tell me, I'll talk to you later, you know, because I tell them I'm not drinking this Kool-Aid, man.
[03:52:11.872 --> 03:52:12.252]  You know?
[03:52:12.792 --> 03:52:14.713]  And, um, I don't want to keep you.
[03:52:14.753 --> 03:52:15.733]  I want to make one point.
[03:52:15.773 --> 03:52:18.073]  I've been meaning to ask you this question for a long time.
[03:52:18.293 --> 03:52:19.453]  This is about Walmart.
[03:52:19.893 --> 03:52:31.196]  And on your, on your site, you know, you have a lot of sponsors talking about, you know, uh, growing your own foods and, and, and, you know, not depending on, on the system for the foods and stuff like that.
[03:52:31.416 --> 03:52:35.256]  Now I noticed something, Jordan Maxwell always talked about signs and symbols.
[03:52:35.696 --> 03:52:39.177]  Anybody that go to Walmart now should know that Walmart changed their symbol.
[03:52:40.097 --> 03:52:42.218]  And now it's like the sun, right?
[03:52:42.638 --> 03:52:45.740]  It's like the sun rays and it has different things like that.
[03:52:46.160 --> 03:53:00.208]  And I want to know your opinion about what role do you think Walmart plays in the coming new era of things, the homogenizing of food and resources and things like that.
[03:53:00.228 --> 03:53:06.532]  Okay, let me tell you, let me tell you, I've got to go because I've got to leave in just about five minutes and I want to take a final call from Ken Cade and Betty.
[03:53:07.572 --> 03:53:08.332]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:53:08.352 --> 03:53:09.033]  I love talking to you.
[03:53:09.193 --> 03:53:09.913]  Call me back next week.
[03:53:11.393 --> 03:53:13.554]  Walmart is now the biggest corporation in the world.
[03:53:13.654 --> 03:53:18.396]  They have close to 40% of total global retail sales, and it's more than half in the United States.
[03:53:18.496 --> 03:53:19.376]  Total retail sales!
[03:53:19.936 --> 03:53:21.017]  They're part of Black Ops.
[03:53:21.037 --> 03:53:28.099]  They admittedly have the FBI running them at the Walmart Distribution Command Center computer system in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[03:53:28.499 --> 03:53:30.560]  They're doing forced inoculation drills there.
[03:53:31.040 --> 03:53:32.440]  They've had the military involved with them.
[03:53:32.661 --> 03:53:33.961]  We told people that a decade ago.
[03:53:34.021 --> 03:53:35.221]  Now it's come out mainstream news.
[03:53:35.241 --> 03:53:36.702]  That's the quick and the dirty on it.
[03:53:37.082 --> 03:53:43.265]  Going back to your analogy of the guy acting good cop, bad cop, one guy's bad, the other guy acts nice, and they rob you.
[03:53:44.126 --> 03:53:47.107]  I forget the name of the classic scam, but you've seen it in movies and culture.
[03:53:47.127 --> 03:53:48.288]  It may have happened to you in person.
[03:53:49.588 --> 03:53:53.410]  You see a woman in a parking lot running saying, help me, help me, he's hitting me, he's beating me.
[03:53:54.731 --> 03:53:56.752]  And then you go, hey mister, leave her alone.
[03:53:57.392 --> 03:54:04.896]  And then you put her in the car with you, and they put a gun to your head, and she says, pull over here, and her boyfriend gets in and says, ah, you stupid schmuck, and they kill you or rob you.
[03:54:05.953 --> 03:54:06.974]  That's good cop, bad cop.
[03:54:09.796 --> 03:54:20.285]  It's like this whole world is a New World Order carnival and we're just leaving one ride run by George Bush and there's a slicker guy in a conductor hat, a big black top hat, and he's up there slick and he's even talking bad.
[03:54:20.305 --> 03:54:24.128]  Don't go over to that ride, that's a bad game, that's a scam.
[03:54:24.368 --> 03:54:25.549]  Come over here and play my game.
[03:54:26.329 --> 03:54:27.590]  But it's all owned by the same carnival.
[03:54:30.173 --> 03:54:31.293]  So that's the bottom line on that.
[03:54:31.313 --> 03:54:35.357]  Let me just ask, is the job interview person here for me to talk to him?
[03:54:37.226 --> 03:54:41.308]  Go ask Mike, because a lot of times these people are late or they don't show up and I can't even go longer.
[03:54:41.328 --> 03:54:43.330]  But if they are here, I've got to end this in about three minutes.
[03:54:44.130 --> 03:54:46.531]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken Cade in Kentucky.
[03:54:46.571 --> 03:54:48.172]  Ken Cade, you're on the air.
[03:54:49.053 --> 03:54:50.514]  Alex, thanks so much for taking my call.
[03:54:50.554 --> 03:54:51.674]  I have so much I want to say.
[03:54:51.734 --> 03:54:52.855]  I don't know how I'm going to get to it.
[03:54:53.315 --> 03:54:55.336]  First of all, I want to start with Barack Obama.
[03:54:55.536 --> 03:54:59.599]  I can't be the only one that was about to have a panic attack watching this inauguration this morning.
[03:54:59.619 --> 03:55:03.140]  To me, it looked like Nazi Germany, in my opinion.
[03:55:05.288 --> 03:55:10.011]  All the t-shirts, the banners, the logos, everything like that.
[03:55:11.211 --> 03:55:15.313]  He can speak very well, and there was another man that could do that as well.
[03:55:16.274 --> 03:55:19.556]  Getting off of that topic, I want to ask you one question I've been meaning to ask.
[03:55:19.796 --> 03:55:28.840]  The way I see this going down is 1984, Brave New World, almost a technocracy enslavement, basically.
[03:55:28.980 --> 03:55:31.782]  The digital TV switch, do you have any opinions about that?
[03:55:33.712 --> 03:55:36.534]  Yeah, all of that can be tracked better, all that can be traced better.
[03:55:36.554 --> 03:55:40.477]  The digital cable, you know, all these digital computers is tracking and tracing everybody.
[03:55:40.798 --> 03:55:43.059]  The high def TVs have been psych warfare design.
[03:55:43.079 --> 03:55:45.461]  That's mainstream news to flicker and mesmerize people.
[03:55:46.302 --> 03:55:51.886]  Classical TV with its lines per second resolution, you know, did that in the studies.
[03:55:52.367 --> 03:55:58.832]  I've been inside the UT Psych Department where whole floors are being funded by DARPA and the Pentagon just to test how to flicker rates with humans.
[03:55:58.852 --> 03:55:59.733]  They also have monkeys.
[03:56:00.333 --> 03:56:02.555]  With wires in their brains, testing their brainwaves.
[03:56:02.595 --> 03:56:03.596]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[03:56:03.656 --> 03:56:05.237]  It's all scientific tyranny.
[03:56:05.677 --> 03:56:08.720]  And Barack Obama is just a front man and a puppet, and I appreciate your call.
[03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:13.483]  What I want to do is, because Ron Paul's not coming up for 15 minutes.
[03:56:14.784 --> 03:56:17.346]  About 15 minutes into the rebroadcast Ron Paul was on.
[03:56:17.366 --> 03:56:20.008]  I want people watching and listening to be able to hear that when we go back to rebroadcast.
[03:56:20.369 --> 03:56:22.751]  But the Russia Today thing, it's what, 13, 14 minutes long?
[03:56:24.552 --> 03:56:29.256]  When we end this, we'll keep streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv so folks can see this.
[03:56:31.312 --> 03:56:34.358]  And, uh, you guys know what I'm talking about?
[03:56:36.061 --> 03:56:40.750]  And then, when it's over, we'll cut to the Ron Paul interview in Refood.
[03:56:41.832 --> 03:56:43.674]  Especially for internet stream listeners out there.
[03:56:44.855 --> 03:56:47.117]  The Russians kind of have a weird player they're using on their site.
[03:56:47.137 --> 03:56:51.541]  A lot of folks can't get it, so we'll just stream it out for you out there on the web so everybody can see it.
[03:56:52.002 --> 03:56:54.064]  You can at least listen to it on audio.
[03:56:56.406 --> 03:56:57.767]  I don't have time to take that final call.
[03:56:57.808 --> 03:56:58.108]  I'm sorry.
[03:56:58.128 --> 03:56:59.049]  I've got a job interview.
[03:56:59.169 --> 03:57:00.390]  Folks here are going to go interview.
[03:57:01.351 --> 03:57:02.112]  God bless you all.
[03:57:02.132 --> 03:57:02.912]  Be back tomorrow.
[03:57:04.557 --> 03:57:05.918]  Live 11 to 3 Central.
[03:57:05.978 --> 03:57:07.198]  May go into overdrive again.
[03:57:07.218 --> 03:57:09.319]  I'm going to go ahead and wrap this up.
[03:57:09.339 --> 03:57:12.040]  I want to thank the crew for a fabulous job and a very stressful day.
[03:57:12.400 --> 03:57:13.361]  Ron Paul's coming up.
[03:57:13.421 --> 03:57:14.421]  Mike Rivera's coming up.
[03:57:15.202 --> 03:57:16.462]  A bunch of other key guests.
[03:57:17.302 --> 03:57:18.523]  Did we ever get Luke Radowski on?
[03:57:20.184 --> 03:57:25.706]  Because he's going to confront MSNBC again and try to take over part of the live broadcast peacefully with his shouts.
[03:57:26.286 --> 03:57:27.427]  We'll see what happens to him there.
[03:57:27.467 --> 03:57:29.608]  God, I hope they get out of there with the great footage they've got because I want to
[03:57:30.475 --> 03:57:35.740]  Maybe we can put some of that in the new Barack Obama film we're making, which by the way, talk about volunteerism.
[03:57:36.161 --> 03:57:37.842]  Get the film when it comes out in a month or two.
[03:57:38.223 --> 03:57:40.145]  We're rushing to make it, but I want to make it good.
[03:57:40.665 --> 03:57:43.108]  So much information, this new Barack Obama film.
[03:57:43.128 --> 03:57:45.430]  I'm not going to tell you the name yet, but that's coming up.
[03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:48.293]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to myself on Russia Today.
[03:57:48.353 --> 03:57:49.794]  Today, and then Ron Paul.
[03:57:49.814 --> 03:57:50.175]  Stay with us.
[03:57:51.118 --> 03:57:51.858]  Paul was on today.
[03:57:52.799 --> 03:58:00.143]  Well, to comment on this historic moment in American history, we're now joined live on the phone by radio host Alex Jones.
[03:58:00.823 --> 03:58:02.624]  Hello to you, Alex Jones.
[03:58:03.284 --> 03:58:06.466]  Obama's pre-election campaign was focused on getting the U.S.
[03:58:06.786 --> 03:58:11.729]  out of the crisis, but this inauguration is the most expensive in the country's history.
[03:58:11.749 --> 03:58:17.752]  In a time of financial crisis, is spending so much money on an inauguration appropriate?
[03:58:20.175 --> 03:58:35.227]  Well, look, the Anglo-American establishment is bragging in Newsweek magazine, the Financial Times of London, Henry Kissinger has said on CNBC television that they have orchestrated the financial crisis, the oligarchs of England and the United States,
[03:58:35.979 --> 03:58:49.822]  Uh, our engineering, this entire thing, so they could care less about $150 million for inauguration, a few hundred million more for 47,000 armed regular army troops and police on the streets turning America into an open police state.
[03:58:50.002 --> 03:58:58.904]  Uh, so, uh, I mean $150 million for his parties and his inauguration, uh, is nothing compared to the overall
[03:58:59.761 --> 03:59:00.682]  I don't know.
[03:59:16.041 --> 03:59:22.626]  ...behind all these unpopular things like 8.5 trillion stolen by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve out of the U.S.
[03:59:22.686 --> 03:59:26.489]  Treasury in the last three months, along with the Banker Takeover Bill.
[03:59:26.849 --> 03:59:29.891]  Even Bloomberg News admits the War Powers Act has been declared.
[03:59:29.971 --> 03:59:33.994]  Congress has been threatened with physical martial law if they don't go along with this.
[03:59:34.174 --> 03:59:36.596]  Bush has passed the baton to Barack Obama.
[03:59:37.076 --> 03:59:39.038]  He's going to try to get international support.
[03:59:40.396 --> 03:59:40.956]  We're good to go.
[03:59:57.970 --> 03:59:58.991]  Of course he's partying like it's 1999.
[03:59:59.071 --> 04:00:01.233]  Of course he's having a great time.
[04:00:01.253 --> 04:00:03.796]  Of course he's arrogantly up there making moonilies.
[04:00:16.701 --> 04:00:17.722]  We're good to go.
[04:00:37.621 --> 04:00:40.262]  Okay, well, let's talk about the economic problems.
[04:00:40.282 --> 04:00:46.003]  The Democrats are known as a party which is good at solving economic problems.
[04:00:46.063 --> 04:00:51.425]  In your opinion, as the new president, does he have the experience to cope with the current economic problems?
[04:01:05.814 --> 04:01:09.055]  Well, I mean, he works for the elite that engineered it.
[04:01:09.095 --> 04:01:16.098]  His new Treasury Secretary, Goettner, doesn't even pay income taxes like the rest of the public do.
[04:01:16.118 --> 04:01:18.019]  65% of our Congress doesn't pay income taxes.
[04:01:18.419 --> 04:01:19.579]  They are above the law.
[04:01:19.659 --> 04:01:21.120]  They have exempted themselves.
[04:01:21.604 --> 04:01:23.105]  from all the laws we have to follow.
[04:01:23.145 --> 04:01:25.266]  So people say, does he have the experience to save us?
[04:01:25.646 --> 04:01:26.767]  He doesn't want to save us.
[04:01:26.787 --> 04:01:27.867]  He doesn't want to help us.
[04:01:28.187 --> 04:01:31.909]  Do the oligarchs in your country in the mid-1990s want to save you?
[04:01:31.969 --> 04:01:35.951]  No, they wanted to blow the economy out with IMF oil bank shock therapy.
[04:01:35.971 --> 04:01:43.015]  They're going to do that here so they can devalue everything down to almost nothing so they can buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[04:01:43.035 --> 04:01:49.018]  The Trilateral Commission, the CFR, they are all openly in publications admitting
[04:01:49.702 --> 04:01:51.703]  Let's talk about his approval rating then.
[04:02:13.830 --> 04:02:22.933]  He enjoys an unprecedented approval rating, as we know, 82% I believe, and how will people react if change doesn't happen soon?
[04:02:23.013 --> 04:02:25.674]  Is this high support a short-lived thing, would you say?
[04:02:26.494 --> 04:02:43.199]  Yes, Obama and his Vice President Biden and all the major analysts say he has 150 to 200 days while the public is still somewhat suffered by him and his mass media hopes that he's actually a good guy when his open agenda is the opposite of what this country needs.
[04:02:43.795 --> 04:02:49.238]  And so, the people are going to become disillusioned very, very quickly.
[04:02:49.258 --> 04:02:54.821]  The pro-corporate media here is hyping the fact that he's really got a 65% approval rating.
[04:02:55.161 --> 04:02:56.282]  It's really not that high.
[04:02:56.622 --> 04:02:58.663]  We've been talking to people on the ground in D.C.
[04:02:58.784 --> 04:03:06.048]  on my own radio show today, and they are saying, yeah, he is betraying us on warrantless wiretapping.
[04:03:06.348 --> 04:03:08.629]  He is betraying us saying the troops are going to stay in Iraq.
[04:03:09.009 --> 04:03:11.371]  He is betraying us with his banker bailout.
[04:03:12.256 --> 04:03:19.322]  And so they're already becoming apprehensive, but the media, in unison, this never happened in the U.S.
[04:03:19.362 --> 04:03:20.263]  Totally behind it.
[04:03:20.543 --> 04:03:22.144]  You make it sound like it's a conspiracy.
[04:03:22.424 --> 04:03:24.526]  Why would you say that the media is doing this?
[04:03:24.606 --> 04:03:27.589]  Why this big hoax that you're discussing, you're telling me about?
[04:03:27.609 --> 04:03:33.574]  No, I'm telling you, the mainline corporate media is owned by the military industrial complex and the private bank.
[04:03:34.334 --> 04:03:36.476]  And they want to take over the United States.
[04:03:37.051 --> 04:03:38.912]  They want to destroy the economy.
[04:03:39.052 --> 04:03:44.815]  They've stated this in their scholarly papers, not on the public nightly news, so they can consolidate.
[04:03:44.835 --> 04:03:51.179]  This is a conspiracy, but it is an open conspiracy, just like what the oligarchs did in Russia.
[04:03:51.279 --> 04:03:56.962]  It is the same group, it is the same crew, out of England, that are orchestrating this.
[04:03:57.472 --> 04:04:05.114]  That's why they are trying to cause a new Cold War with Russia because they're angry that your government and your people kicked the oligarchs out.
[04:04:05.214 --> 04:04:09.395]  We have the same group of oligarchs in the United States that are doing this.
[04:04:09.435 --> 04:04:17.997]  So the media is all getting behind Barack Obama to whip up support so they can sell the public on going along with the wider agenda.
[04:04:18.097 --> 04:04:19.698]  They need that mass support.
[04:04:20.298 --> 04:04:25.159]  Look, everything he's doing, he wants amnesty for illegal aliens, open borders.
[04:04:25.849 --> 04:04:27.510]  91% of the Gallup polls are against that.
[04:04:28.190 --> 04:04:30.211]  We want new banker takeover.
[04:04:30.231 --> 04:04:31.192]  That's unpopular.
[04:04:31.992 --> 04:04:43.317]  Do you think then, in the light of what you've been saying, that the American political spectrum is likely to change under the new president, now that the Republican era is over?
[04:04:43.337 --> 04:04:46.958]  Is this an age of liberalism?
[04:04:48.139 --> 04:04:50.500]  No, it's a false left cover.
[04:04:51.622 --> 04:04:56.824]  Uh, so that, I mean, just as Hitler, you know, at first claimed he was a socialist and used left cover, but he was really a fascist.
[04:04:57.304 --> 04:04:58.724]  Same thing with Benito Mussolini.
[04:04:59.205 --> 04:05:00.585]  We've seen this over and over again.
[04:05:00.605 --> 04:05:11.349]  We're gonna see better rhetoric, we're gonna see a slicker speaker, uh, with more deceptive, uh, tone, reaching out to the world, but in words only.
[04:05:11.609 --> 04:05:13.229]  The deeds are all the same.
[04:05:13.389 --> 04:05:16.731]  Everything Obama said he would do a year ago, he has now reversed.
[04:05:18.875 --> 04:05:28.762]  ...reverse the undue powers given to the presidency... ...dictatorial powers... ...under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, C.D.D.
[04:05:29.123 --> 04:05:28.762]  51.
[04:05:29.403 --> 04:05:40.831]  He's now stared up with Stephanopoulos last week on national television that agrees with Cheney that he's going to probably keep all those new undue powers that the presidency has taken on.
[04:05:41.191 --> 04:05:46.075]  So what's happening is the military-industrial complex... ...owns both parties.
[04:05:47.475 --> 04:05:51.416]  My fellow citizens, the administration needs to learn not to transition.
[04:05:51.716 --> 04:05:53.756]  The Americans need to learn not to transition.
[04:05:53.776 --> 04:05:55.456]  We've been spoken during the entire network.
[04:05:55.476 --> 04:05:59.237]  We haven't had a real president in the United States since they killed John F. Kennedy in 1963.
[04:06:14.730 --> 04:06:30.094]  Russia's own foreign minister, if the military was considering staging a coup against him during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and that's why Russia went ahead and went for detente, because Kennedy reached out and said, listen, you understand they want to have a war.
[04:06:30.254 --> 04:06:31.855]  They want the state terror attack.
[04:06:32.075 --> 04:06:34.236]  Operation Northward.
[04:06:34.276 --> 04:06:39.357]  So I believe that we're going to see an acceleration of what we had under Bush, but because
[04:06:40.018 --> 04:06:43.159]  He has a new face because he's the first black president.
[04:06:43.339 --> 04:06:48.080]  People think that's change, but that's only change on the surface.
[04:06:48.120 --> 04:06:50.541]  And look at who he's packing his cabinet with.
[04:06:50.901 --> 04:06:54.102]  General Jim Jones, Secretary of Defense Gates.
[04:06:54.922 --> 04:07:03.765]  They are bringing in all of these people who were in the Bush administration, who were the worst characters from the Clinton administration, and all these former IMF and World Bank heads.
[04:07:04.804 --> 04:07:05.964]  We're good to go.
[04:07:24.366 --> 04:07:29.348]  They openly say that within a year to two years there will be open rebellion and insurrection in the street.
[04:07:29.388 --> 04:07:36.032]  They admit they're going to use all the new anti-terror powers they claim were Al-Qaeda against the American people.
[04:07:36.572 --> 04:07:38.373]  Can we talk about torture here?
[04:07:38.393 --> 04:07:43.855]  Obama spoke out against torture.
[04:07:44.396 --> 04:07:51.379]  Will his presidency be more transparent in terms of how he approaches human rights issues such as Guantanamo in the light of what you've been saying?
[04:07:51.399 --> 04:07:51.539]  No.
[04:07:54.272 --> 04:07:56.173]  What he's going to do is they'll have better rhetoric.
[04:07:56.553 --> 04:08:03.095]  He's saying he's going to close Guantanamo, he may, he says, within six months to a year.
[04:08:03.715 --> 04:08:04.015]  Okay?
[04:08:04.355 --> 04:08:17.639]  He's saying he will close it, but ABC News reported a week ago, what we already knew, they have built 14 secret, and that's the headline, secret Guantanamos inside the United States.
[04:08:17.679 --> 04:08:19.280]  Before they did it outside the country.
[04:08:19.700 --> 04:08:22.681]  Now they've built 14 bridges in South Carolina, Texas,
[04:08:23.353 --> 04:08:38.116]  In California, these will be totally secret, and they've just renamed harsh interrogation away from torture, and they are going to continue the torture, not to mention an unknown number of black ops sites.
[04:08:39.456 --> 04:08:42.677]  Those sites where they torture people.
[04:08:43.977 --> 04:08:45.177]  In Georgia, the U.S.
[04:08:45.217 --> 04:08:45.817]  takes them there.
[04:08:46.157 --> 04:08:49.598]  In Ukraine, in Poland, in Egypt.
[04:08:50.283 --> 04:08:56.546]  Uh, and in Jordan, and those are just the, uh, in, in Romania, these are the real torture camps.
[04:08:56.886 --> 04:09:02.409]  Guantanamo was just a public camp to condition the public in the United States to accept this.
[04:09:02.509 --> 04:09:12.755]  Now, Houston Chronicle's reported they have built four one-million-man camps for the American people for Geryon's insurrection.
[04:09:12.915 --> 04:09:17.317]  So, so no, you're going to see the huge apparatus for, quote, fighting Al-Qaeda
[04:09:20.317 --> 04:09:24.441]  Okay, well thank you Mr. Jones.
[04:09:24.461 --> 04:09:25.862]  You obviously are not going to see change.
[04:09:25.902 --> 04:09:33.409]  You don't see Obama as changing things the way everybody else is seeing him as a person for change.
[04:09:33.870 --> 04:09:37.393]  Alex Jones, radio host, live on the telephone from USA.
[04:09:37.433 --> 04:09:38.674]  Thank you so much for your views.
[04:09:38.694 --> 04:09:39.234]  Thank you.
