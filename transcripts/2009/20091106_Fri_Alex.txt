[00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.631]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.212]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:12.772]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:16.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:21.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:53.236]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome another very important worldwide broadcast today on this 6th day of November this Friday edition the 6th day of November 2009 we're going to have wide open phones wide open phones throughout the first half at least of this syndicated radio broadcast
[00:00:54.056 --> 00:01:12.515]  So that people can chime in with their take on the very inconsistent, very suspicious news coverage on the massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, just about 75 miles from where I sit here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.995]  Fort Hood, the biggest military base in the world, the biggest U.S.
[00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.138]  military base, obviously as well.
[00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:32.728]  A giant army base that's got underground bunkers in the mountain range, underground railways, spurs going out all over the nation.
[00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:38.372]  One comes out underneath Bergstrom Airport here in Austin, formerly SAC Command Base.
[00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:42.968]  That's a little inside baseball for folks that don't know about that.
[00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:47.791]  This is complete spook central, black ops central, mind control central.
[00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:54.294]  They trained the Delta Force for the Waco massacre there, according to congressional documents.
[00:01:54.294 --> 00:02:00.718]  And we just continue to see all sorts of chicanery coming out of Fort Hood.
[00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:06.341]  It's geographically six times bigger than Dallas, Texas.
[00:02:07.913 --> 00:02:16.639]  It's, the main base is 340 square miles, but then there's a bunch of other spur bases off of it.
[00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.162]  I mean, it's just deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:25.826]  Obviously, our prayers go out to the 12 dead, 31 wounded.
[00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:30.109]  I wonder if they'll call for gun bans on base.
[00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.650]  Ban the military from owning guns.
[00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.031]  I mean, that's the answer for the citizens.
[00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.252]  This guy was a psychiatrist.
[00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:40.016]  He was involved in Homeland Security drills.
[00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:44.142]  A lot of witnesses said they saw two other shooters shooting people.
[00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:47.547]  It's always the same with Colin Byne and 7-7, all these events.
[00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:51.204]  It has the same MO.
[00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.705]  We know Columbine was staged.
[00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.805]  We know 7-7 was staged.
[00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.546]  We know 1993 was staged.
[00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:58.266]  That's even been in the New York Times.
[00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.607]  I don't know if this was staged.
[00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:01.947]  This guy's a psychiatrist.
[00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:05.388]  They have the highest level of any profession of suicide.
[00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:09.369]  They have the highest level of any profession of being committed.
[00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:16.111]  These are people that think all of the public has a chemical imbalance and needs to be on Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:16.751]  I will bet
[00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.292]  All the tea in India that this guy was self-medicating as a psychiatrist.
[00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:24.973]  He wasn't just a psychologist.
[00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:30.717]  He had a medical degree in quackery.
[00:03:30.717 --> 00:03:31.037]  Okay?
[00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:39.697]  And no, I'm not saying there isn't some true information in psychiatry and psychology.
[00:03:39.697 --> 00:03:46.121]  It's just that the different schools and the way the government brings it forward, it's become a tool of oppression.
[00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:57.868]  And it's just, it is a fake science to tell a kid, you're not bouncing off the walls because you're drinking sugar filled with red dye and not getting proper nutrients.
[00:03:59.893 --> 00:04:01.794]  Let's not give you a good diet.
[00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:05.655]  Let's put you on a chemical weapon.
[00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:09.117]  That's what the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are.
[00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:13.899]  I mean, yeah, there are a lot of snake bites that as you're dying, you kind of have a rush of exhilaration at the end of it.
[00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.720]  There's a lot of poison that feels good.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.000]  Methamphetamine.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.021]  Total poison.
[00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:20.961]  Morons use it.
[00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:25.283]  But the issue here is, they're putting our kids on Ritalin, Prozac, all these other drugs.
[00:04:28.157 --> 00:04:33.501]  They've got millions of the troops on it.
[00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:35.643]  Millions of veterans are on it.
[00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:43.349]  And it is on the drug insert that'll make you have a psychotic break under stress and start killing people.
[00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.451]  I mean, this is what it does.
[00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.593]  And none of the media is talking about this.
[00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:52.197]  I have not seen anyone, including my writers, I'm not bashing my writers,
[00:04:53.362 --> 00:04:55.349]  I just wonder how everybody missed this.
[00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.698]  I'll guarantee you he's a Prozac head.
[00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:58.762]  Guaranteed!
[00:04:58.762 --> 00:04:59.424]  Guaranteed!
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:03.576]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:08.918]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:10.959]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.961]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:17.142]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:18.282]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:20.163]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:21.223]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:23.444]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:24.785]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:26.306]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.346]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:28.828]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.551]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:35.156]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.156 --> 00:05:38.981]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.202]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.202 --> 00:05:41.103]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.103 --> 00:05:42.205]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:43.146]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:43.947]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.207 --> 00:05:47.269]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:54.812]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:55.893]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:55.893 --> 00:06:01.576]  Great.
[00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:05.598]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.839]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:13.628]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:20.013]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:25.218]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.401]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:35.207]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:37.649]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:39.250]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.692]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.833]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:48.977]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:48.977 --> 00:07:00.145]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:02.167]  When you hear the words water purification,
[00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:05.676]  I think so.
[00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:20.587]  I think.

[00:07:55.046 --> 00:08:02.012]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today!
[00:08:02.012 --> 00:08:08.637]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:11.620]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:29.180]  All right, we have three extremely important guests coming on today.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.642]  Very important issues.
[00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:45.173]  We've got Chris Freiberg from Fairbanks Daily News Minor, mainstream newspaper coming on, about the army out arresting people and tasering people on civilian highways.
[00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:50.417]  Just another example of posse comitatus being flushed down the proverbial commode.
[00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.647]  We've got Bob Chapman for his weekly visit on the economy.
[00:08:54.647 --> 00:08:58.608]  Boy, is this a timely time to have him on.
[00:08:58.608 --> 00:09:15.212]  And then we have Greg Gordon, the McClatchy newspaper writer that wrote this detailed article about Goldman Sachs betting against the housing market while telling everybody that it was, that everything was wonderful.
[00:09:16.328 --> 00:09:17.730]  So that's coming up today.
[00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:27.105]  We are going to take your phone calls to get your take on the massacre at Fort Hood, obviously, on the economy, on the flu, whatever you like to discuss.
[00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:37.511]  But please have your questions and comments ready, because I am going to attempt to try to take a lot of your phone calls here today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:43.837]  When you hear one caller become disconnected, that's your chance to call in and get involved on air.
[00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:43.917]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:44.077]  Okay.
[00:09:44.077 --> 00:09:46.419]  I know a lot of you have been watching the news.
[00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.695]  And you've seen all the conflicting reports.
[00:09:57.695 --> 00:10:06.165]  I don't think I've ever seen a mass shooting story that's had this many conflicting reports except for Columbine.
[00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:11.911]  And I've done a lot of deep research on Columbine and we were not told the truth about what happened there.
[00:10:12.557 --> 00:10:18.241]  They smuggled over 120 bombs, according to CBS News, into the building.
[00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:26.266]  The school was more than half empty that day with the word to not go to school floating around because there was going to be a shooting the next day.
[00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:28.668]  There was.
[00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:35.332]  The principal and sheriff were meeting for lunch when all of this went on at a Subway sandwich shop down the street.
[00:10:36.982 --> 00:10:46.469]  Most of the witnesses reported men in black uniforms and masks shooting people, at least four shooters, not two.
[00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:49.632]  Harris and Kleibold made a video about how they were going to kill everybody.
[00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:53.675]  They worked with the school and the video production department.
[00:10:53.675 --> 00:11:00.420]  Their parents were both involved in secret, above top secret, black programs with NASA and the Pentagon.
[00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:09.985]  Both Harris and Kleibold were on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:14.568]  And it was confirmed that a SWAT team shot at least two students.
[00:11:14.568 --> 00:11:16.629]  That was in the Rocky Mountain Daily News.
[00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:21.771]  That was confirmed in police recordings that were sealed by the court.
[00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:23.272]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:25.613]  But it's like 9-11.
[00:11:25.613 --> 00:11:28.094]  We know the official story's not true.
[00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:29.495]  That's been proven.
[00:11:29.495 --> 00:11:31.216]  But we don't know exactly what happened.
[00:11:32.386 --> 00:11:34.187]  That's the problem with an investigation.
[00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:41.370]  You know when you're being lied to, you just don't know what happened.
[00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.731]  Now I will say this about what happened in Fort Hood.
[00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:46.012]  Number one, the media is hyping this.
[00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:51.559]  Like it is the greatest event in modern times.
[00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:57.344]  Though I pulled up some of the numbers, there have been scores of mass shootings at other bases.
[00:11:57.344 --> 00:12:04.589]  There was one killing more than eight people a few years ago at Fort Bragg, a bunch of other events.
[00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:15.337]  And normally when you have a mass shooting and it's really someone with combat stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, or a lot of the troops came back and shot up their families or their commanders,
[00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:38.957]  Or their subordinates because they were on, in the last six, seven years, this experimental anti-malaria drug, which was not approved, but the Pentagon used it, and then now they've had to pull it off the market and not give it to the military because it causes psychotic breaks.
[00:12:38.957 --> 00:12:42.820]  Remember, we had a documentary filmmaker on
[00:12:45.230 --> 00:13:02.675]  But Joe Bellinger, and he was down in South America doing shoots 24 times, and he said that he took that same antiviral drug and basically had an apocalypse now moment like Martin Sheen does where he literally was having a psychotic break in his hotel room.
[00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:07.297]  So a lot of these mass shootings were caused by that drug alone, clearly.
[00:13:07.297 --> 00:13:09.137]  I've talked to people that have been on it.
[00:13:09.137 --> 00:13:10.178]  They say it is just
[00:13:12.628 --> 00:13:15.229]  Like a bad acid trip or something.
[00:13:15.229 --> 00:13:17.370]  It is just horrible.
[00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.352]  And you give this to the Delta Force, these highly trained people, they're going to go crazy.
[00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:29.395]  You know, they come home from combat and their wife's screaming at them and they just kill them.
[00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:31.896]  So that's going on.
[00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:33.397]  He was about to be sent to Iraq.
[00:13:35.287 --> 00:13:40.068]  I've read they don't put people in Iraq on anti-malaria drugs, they do in Afghanistan.
[00:13:40.068 --> 00:13:41.428]  So, I don't know.
[00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:53.390]  I mean, there's just too many factors, too many pieces of the puzzle at this point for myself to be able to come on air and tell you concisely that I know what's going on.
[00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.191]  I don't, okay?
[00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:59.551]  I don't just sit here and make up conspiracy theories for no reason.
[00:13:59.551 --> 00:14:02.132]  This guy could have been just a lunatic
[00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:10.629]  Psychiatrists, they are the number one profession to be committed.
[00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:21.294]  They are the number one profession, the highest level of suicide of any profession, of any professional field.
[00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:24.776]  They, of course, are the number one medicated group.
[00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:28.718]  Doctors and medical workers, number one, are the number one group
[00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:36.921]  According to the Justice Department and other statistics that are out there to abuse drugs because they have access to it.
[00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:41.323]  And then of that group, psychiatrists and psychologists are at the top of the chart.
[00:14:41.323 --> 00:14:47.104]  I mean, they are at the tip top of the capstone of using their own poison.
[00:14:47.104 --> 00:14:50.846]  That they dole out to children and women and people that have car wrecks.
[00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:51.906]  Oh, you're depressed because you
[00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.673]  Broke your collarbone and arm and smashed your face in.
[00:14:55.673 --> 00:14:59.217]  Here, we'll put you on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:14:59.217 --> 00:15:09.789]  We won't tell you that the drug insert says it causes psychotic breaks and mass murder and delusions of grandeur or extreme depression and then now they have
[00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:14.923]  Prozac-type drugs for Prozac-type drugs.
[00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:26.867]  They stack them, they advertise that, oh, you're getting depressed or wanting to kill your children on Prozac or on Luvox or any of these other 100-plus drugs.
[00:15:26.867 --> 00:15:33.329]  Oh, well, we have these other drugs that go on top of that.
[00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:36.590]  But nowhere, I did a lot of web searching this morning,
[00:15:37.423 --> 00:15:43.865]  Maybe Curt Nemo or Paul Watson can find it, or Steve Watson can if that's the case, or Aaron Dykes, as they listen right now.
[00:15:43.865 --> 00:15:49.366]  But perhaps listeners can email in to showtips at infowars.com right now.
[00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:56.489]  You know, the power of the group out there is amazing when it comes to research.
[00:15:56.489 --> 00:16:04.691]  But is anyone discussing whether or not this guy was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other antipsychotics?
[00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:07.499]  Because that's what these are.
[00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:15.065]  They're in the hallucinogen family, the psychotropic family, which is in the overall anti-psychotic family.
[00:16:15.065 --> 00:16:19.970]  And they actually make you go psychotic in many cases.
[00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:29.518]  99% of the mass shootings are women drowning their babies in bathtubs, or driving cars off cliffs with their children in them, or chopping their children's hands off, or slitting their throats.
[00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:33.790]  Are on Prozac family of drugs.
[00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.352]  So he's a psychiatrist.
[00:16:36.352 --> 00:16:42.275]  They say he'd been having mental problems, had been written up, was trying to get out of the military.
[00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:46.197]  I would say there is more than a 99% chance.
[00:16:46.197 --> 00:16:51.040]  I would be surprised if it didn't come out that this guy was a complete fruit loop.
[00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:57.940]  Now, we still have to ask ourselves, why were we hearing about two other shooters?
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:18.593]  Why were we hearing that this deranged individual was... Why were we hearing that this deranged individual was dead for four hours
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:30.949]  From the time that the story broke, why were we hearing that Nadal Hassan was dead until at least four hours after?
[00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:32.190]  Let me see it.
[00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:42.118]  1.30 central it broke and then it wasn't till 7.30 that the AP reported that and it came over my iPhone.
[00:17:42.118 --> 00:17:46.361]  So that's more than four hours.
[00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:48.623]  That is six hours.
[00:17:50.023 --> 00:17:55.285]  So they didn't report for six hours that he was alive.
[00:17:55.285 --> 00:18:00.226]  And then they said they had these other people in custody and witnesses reported multiple shooters.
[00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:09.269]  Or were people panicking and seeing military people that somehow got to firearms in their own vehicles or had firearms?
[00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:11.670]  And that's how we're getting these reports.
[00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.031]  We don't know right now.
[00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:16.472]  And the military lies so much
[00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:20.548]  The military brass lie more often than they tell the truth.
[00:18:20.548 --> 00:18:22.569]  So, frankly, we may never know.
[00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:28.555]  But he is a psychiatrist.
[00:18:28.555 --> 00:18:33.720]  He had been having problems and had been written up and was trying to get out of the military.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.342]  And so, I don't know.
[00:18:36.342 --> 00:18:36.903]  I don't know.
[00:18:36.903 --> 00:18:42.128]  We'll get your take on it after we come back from this quick break.
[00:18:42.128 --> 00:18:43.389]  We'll talk to
[00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:49.848]  Skip and Steve and Paul and Mike and Connie and others, toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:49.848 --> 00:18:52.970]  I do have other important news here today that we're going to be covering.
[00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:12.160]  We're going to get into the fact that the jobless rate tops 10% for the first time since 1983.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.023]  And those are cooked unemployment numbers.
[00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:16.746]  We'll talk about that with Bob Chapman.
[00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:19.349]  This is a massive jobless recovery.
[00:19:19.349 --> 00:19:20.170]  An oxymoron.
[00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:28.487]  They invent these new terms daily that are just absolutely asinine to anyone that has two brain cells rubbed together.
[00:19:28.487 --> 00:19:30.389]  We're also going to get more into this L.A.
[00:19:30.389 --> 00:19:33.773]  doctor allegedly faked exam for immigrants who had diseases.
[00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.556]  We'll get into the United States.
[00:19:36.556 --> 00:19:37.237]  We're going to
[00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:47.420]  Get into a host of other issues and your phone calls and talk about the big tea parties yesterday in Washington against the government takeover of health care.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.462]  And all over the news, they called him racist.
[00:19:50.462 --> 00:19:53.424]  They're not allowed to be against socialist government health care.
[00:19:53.424 --> 00:19:56.205]  The media is going to play the race card because they're the real racists.
[00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:57.466]  They're the race pimps.
[00:19:57.466 --> 00:19:58.927]  Just unbelievably outrageous.
[00:19:58.927 --> 00:19:59.347]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.438 --> 00:20:04.200]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:11.364]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[00:20:11.364 --> 00:20:16.367]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[00:20:16.647 --> 00:20:18.729]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:25.214]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[00:20:25.214 --> 00:20:30.177]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[00:20:30.177 --> 00:20:39.505]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:46.190]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.172]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:09.259]  Yeah, don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:10.880]  You should use StartPage instead.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.620]  StartPage?
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.141]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[00:21:13.141 --> 00:21:16.104]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.104 --> 00:21:19.987]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:23.109]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:25.711]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.711 --> 00:21:27.332]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.332 --> 00:21:30.935]  Right, go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.935 --> 00:21:32.456]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:36.699]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.699 --> 00:21:40.503]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:40.503 --> 00:21:45.647]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:45.647 --> 00:21:49.050]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the big brother habit.
[00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.812]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.

[00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:56.176]  That's StartPage.com.
[00:22:01.072 --> 00:22:05.157]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:11.044]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:11.044 --> 00:22:12.145]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:12.145 --> 00:22:16.149]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:30.655]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:30.655 --> 00:22:36.257]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:36.257 --> 00:22:42.139]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:22:42.899 --> 00:22:45.761]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:49.363]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:22:49.363 --> 00:22:50.024]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.024 --> 00:22:51.905]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:51.905 --> 00:22:51.965]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.802 --> 00:23:11.693]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:15.878]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:23:15.878 --> 00:23:18.040]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.486]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:33.672]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:23:33.672 --> 00:23:40.175]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:23:40.175 --> 00:23:43.477]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:23:43.477 --> 00:23:45.578]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:23:45.578 --> 00:23:48.660]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.182]  Heart and body extract gets results.
[00:23:51.182 --> 00:23:54.526]  To order your 2 month supply, call now, toll free at 866-295-5305.

[00:24:14.147 --> 00:24:19.348]  In constant sorrow through his days.
[00:24:24.127 --> 00:24:26.128]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:26.128 --> 00:24:26.989]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:26.989 --> 00:24:27.469]  Central.
[00:24:27.469 --> 00:24:28.669]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.950]  Eastern.
[00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.130]  We're here live.
[00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.531]  Thanks for joining us today.
[00:24:31.531 --> 00:24:36.233]  Let's go to your phone calls and get your take, your response to everything that's happening.
[00:24:36.233 --> 00:24:37.734]  The dollar continuing to plunge.
[00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:39.395]  Gold continuing to rise.
[00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:40.896]  Unemployment at record levels.
[00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.457]  The government's telling us the economy's wonderful.
[00:24:43.457 --> 00:24:45.638]  That more NAFTA, more GATT.
[00:24:45.638 --> 00:24:47.119]  Expansion is going to be great.
[00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:48.440]  Globalization is good.
[00:24:50.711 --> 00:24:53.913]  You've got this spooky shooting going on at Fort Hood.
[00:24:53.913 --> 00:24:59.357]  This guy just looks like a complete lunatic when I look at his photo.
[00:24:59.357 --> 00:25:03.441]  Will this be used to crack down and set up a bigger police state?
[00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:06.563]  No doubt of that.
[00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:08.384]  Let's talk to Skip in California.
[00:25:08.384 --> 00:25:09.245]  Skip, you're on the air.
[00:25:09.245 --> 00:25:09.665]  Go ahead.
[00:25:09.665 --> 00:25:14.749]  Hey, first I want to say hats off to you for Father Republic.
[00:25:14.749 --> 00:25:19.993]  It's definitely your best work and that's a pretty bold statement considering what you've done already.
[00:25:22.093 --> 00:25:33.380]  Sure, um, the other day you actually had a suggestion, and I think you just threw it out there and then went on to other things, but I think you should really kinda rethink that idea.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:46.348]  And what the idea was, is you said you could probably make a, write a book about a, you know, a hundred of the key techniques that the elite use against the public.
[00:25:46.348 --> 00:25:49.270]  I think if you were to actually make a DVD
[00:25:51.499 --> 00:26:09.510]  Where you take, you know, the best tricks that the media uses to pull the wool over everybody's eyes and you kind of put it out there, I think what would happen is, you know, your viewers and anyone else that sees it would really be able to identify those techniques every time they see them in the media.
[00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:15.850]  I don't know, maybe intensify everyone's ability to... No, absolutely.
[00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:24.456]  I mean, for more than a decade, I've wanted to make documentaries about media manipulation because a lot of people recognize certain basic forms of it.
[00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:29.019]  One simple form is divide and conquer, but then there's hundreds of subgroups of that.
[00:26:29.019 --> 00:26:38.346]  I mean, when the media comes out and you say, as a citizen, hey, I don't want a trillion, one hundred billion dollar government takeover of healthcare.
[00:26:39.878 --> 00:26:40.058]  I don't
[00:26:56.252 --> 00:27:02.295]  Slimeball, Chris Matthews, all of them yesterday, the same talking point, said this is racism.
[00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:03.956]  They are injecting racism.
[00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:07.558]  They are just putting it where there is no racism involved.
[00:27:07.558 --> 00:27:09.359]  No one was thinking about race.
[00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:14.401]  It has nothing to do with it on its face, and it's just meant to distract and divert.
[00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:16.442]  That's just one example.
[00:27:16.442 --> 00:27:19.784]  And when I say there's a hundred, we'd have to limit it to a hundred.
[00:27:19.784 --> 00:27:20.805]  There's several hundred
[00:27:21.877 --> 00:27:26.160]  Tricks they use and I've just learned to spot them all and they think it's funny.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.621]  It's like I said over a month ago.
[00:27:27.621 --> 00:27:29.883]  I said they're going to have artificial scarcity.
[00:27:29.883 --> 00:27:36.869]  They're going to come out and claim that there's not enough of the vaccine advertise where it's available and then have big lines of people show up.
[00:27:37.952 --> 00:27:41.573]  Because they know that a lot of people don't want it over 70%.
[00:27:41.573 --> 00:27:43.173]  They know they can't sell it.
[00:27:43.173 --> 00:27:46.834]  So if they create the illusion that people want it, people will stampede to get it.
[00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:52.895]  Then it comes out in CFR meetings with top health officials, them bragging how they want to do this.
[00:27:52.895 --> 00:27:55.755]  So again, I'm not a genius.
[00:27:55.755 --> 00:27:57.076]  I've just learned their tricks.
[00:27:57.076 --> 00:28:03.997]  And it's very hard to watch television or to read the newspaper knowing these people's tricks because
[00:28:06.311 --> 00:28:09.033]  It's so obvious once you know the tricks.
[00:28:09.033 --> 00:28:13.635]  It's enraging to see this and you just get sick of it.
[00:28:13.635 --> 00:28:15.276]  I appreciate your call, Skip.
[00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:16.797]  Let's talk to Steve in Texas.
[00:28:16.797 --> 00:28:17.718]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:28:17.718 --> 00:28:18.958]  Go ahead.
[00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:19.939]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[00:28:19.939 --> 00:28:24.862]  Hey, before I give my take on what happened yesterday at Fort Hood, I just want to let you know I'm
[00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:26.167]  I think so.
[00:28:42.903 --> 00:28:43.384]  I don't
[00:28:57.777 --> 00:29:02.940]  And, uh, Pelosi and Frank as well, with as far as, you know, telling them to have an open vote on this.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:11.584]  I also said to each one of them, I made a point to tell each one to go to Infowars.com and get a copy of Follow the Republican.
[00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:13.265]  Watch that to get educated.
[00:29:13.265 --> 00:29:16.146]  So I'm just trying to do whatever I can to get the word out.
[00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:16.646]  Thank you.
[00:29:16.646 --> 00:29:18.947]  What's your view on the, uh, massacre?
[00:29:18.947 --> 00:29:19.808]  Okay.
[00:29:19.808 --> 00:29:25.991]  What you had said, that was one of my first thoughts, was I wonder which psychotropic medication this guy was on.
[00:29:26.776 --> 00:29:29.037]  And here's my bottom line take on this.
[00:29:29.037 --> 00:29:30.378]  You know, you brought this out.
[00:29:30.378 --> 00:29:32.359]  The Pentagon controls the media.
[00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:38.883]  You got Northcom and the NSA and FEMA and all these black propaganda groups.
[00:29:38.883 --> 00:29:41.544]  I believe this was a false flag terror attack.
[00:29:41.544 --> 00:29:44.946]  This guy was an MK Ultra style puppet.
[00:29:44.946 --> 00:29:47.487]  They set him up, used him just like McVeigh.
[00:29:47.487 --> 00:29:48.488]  Well, stay there.
[00:29:48.488 --> 00:29:51.129]  Stay there, because we can't laugh at this because they have a history.
[00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:52.510]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.031]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.035 --> 00:30:00.059]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:05.363]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.363 --> 00:30:09.907]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:09.907 --> 00:30:12.169]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:13.790]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.851]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.051 --> 00:30:23.478]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:32:01.015 --> 00:32:06.179]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:09.682]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:32:09.682 --> 00:32:15.406]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:32:15.406 --> 00:32:17.969]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:22.012]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[00:32:22.492 --> 00:32:25.674]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.

[00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:33.660]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:42.226]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.227]  Don't pick your nose.
[00:32:43.587 --> 00:32:48.169]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:53.291]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:55.031]  Go to nogerms.info.
[00:32:55.031 --> 00:32:57.252]  That's nogerms.info.
[00:32:57.252 --> 00:32:58.973]  Be well and stay well.
[00:32:58.973 --> 00:33:01.494]  Best MZ.
[00:33:01.494 --> 00:33:04.795]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:04.795 --> 00:33:08.056]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.082 --> 00:33:38.779]  If you study criminology, a good investigator generally has been involved in investigations for decades because you have to have a wide knowledge of the criminal mind and you have to have a wide knowledge of subtypes of criminal
[00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:56.904]  Criminal types and then criminal groups and how those criminal groups have operated in the past, because if criminals are one thing, if psychopaths are one thing, if control freaks and scam artists are one thing, they are repetitive.
[00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:59.165]  They are compulsive.
[00:33:59.165 --> 00:34:03.926]  They do the same types of things over and over again.
[00:34:03.926 --> 00:34:05.406]  They have signatures.
[00:34:05.406 --> 00:34:09.427]  And I will tell you that
[00:34:11.252 --> 00:34:17.739]  I didn't start the show saying this guy could be mind-controlled.
[00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:25.468]  But the minute it came out yesterday that he was an army psychiatrist and an officer, alarm bells went off everywhere.
[00:34:25.468 --> 00:34:29.152]  And then, right down the line, alarm bells have gone off.
[00:34:32.148 --> 00:34:58.451]  But it could be, because more often than not it is, that he was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and I will say it again, the drug inserts of all those drugs, by law, we were called conspiracy theorists 10, 15, 20 years ago when medical doctors came out and pointed out that Eli Lilly's trials in 1980-81 of Prozac caused massive increases in suicide and violent actions, including murder.
[00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:08.575]  And then due to lawsuits and that coming out in the last decade, what, four years ago, they started by law, first in England, then in Europe, now in the U.S.
[00:35:08.575 --> 00:35:12.077]  It was six years ago in England and Europe, and then four years ago in the U.S.
[00:35:12.077 --> 00:35:21.262]  By law, the drug insert says, this can make you become psychopathic, kill yourself, kill others, delusions of grandeur, mania.
[00:35:21.262 --> 00:35:22.603]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:35:22.603 --> 00:35:23.843]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:35:23.843 --> 00:35:26.605]  You can go to Prozac's own website and click on the drug
[00:35:27.975 --> 00:35:29.836]  Insert page and read it for yourself.
[00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.157]  I mean, don't believe me.
[00:35:32.157 --> 00:35:43.243]  But pretty much everybody knows that these drugs aren't associated with, they are wedded to mass murder, mass shootings, killings, people killing their children.
[00:35:43.243 --> 00:35:48.586]  I mean, women in the history of the world never chop their two-year-olds arms and legs off.
[00:35:48.586 --> 00:35:51.248]  I mean, that was just unheard of.
[00:35:51.248 --> 00:35:53.589]  Now it's a routine occurrence.
[00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:55.090]  Because this stuff puts them
[00:35:57.802 --> 00:36:01.143]  Into another dimension, psychologically.
[00:36:01.143 --> 00:36:04.124]  Another planet.
[00:36:04.124 --> 00:36:05.744]  So it could be that.
[00:36:05.744 --> 00:36:08.985]  He could be a Muslim extremist.
[00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:09.885]  They do exist.
[00:36:09.885 --> 00:36:19.208]  There are Muslim nutballs, just like there's Christian nutballs, that go out, just like there's Hindu nutballs, who do go out and shoot and kill people.
[00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:24.289]  There is such a thing as real terrorism.
[00:36:24.289 --> 00:36:26.910]  But none of the facts fit that.
[00:36:28.029 --> 00:36:31.591]  And then you have all the conflicting stories by the media.
[00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:38.774]  And the fact that they didn't announce for six hours, six plus hours, that he was still alive and they said he was dead.
[00:36:38.774 --> 00:36:40.015]  On and on and on.
[00:36:40.015 --> 00:36:43.437]  And they haven't released his file.
[00:36:43.437 --> 00:36:47.238]  They're saying he was in trouble and trying to get out and had been in counseling.
[00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.839]  99% chance he was on drugs.
[00:36:53.302 --> 00:36:58.787]  I'm gonna go back to Steve, Paul, Mike, Connie, Nick in a moment, but Steve brought up mind control.
[00:36:58.787 --> 00:37:04.211]  And I'm not gonna discuss mind control here on this show unless I give you a little bit of background.
[00:37:04.211 --> 00:37:16.682]  But in the interest of time to be able to take your calls, perhaps we should set up in the next few weeks a two or three hours group of guests on the radio, medical doctors,
[00:37:18.004 --> 00:37:27.928]  And historians on the declassified history of mind control, not just in the US, but in Russia, China, England, and many other nations.
[00:37:27.928 --> 00:37:35.692]  You know, Hollywood has this image of the Manchurian Candidate and popular remake came out a few years ago.
[00:37:35.692 --> 00:37:41.454]  You need to understand that that original film was based on real programs.
[00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:42.395]  And in 1976 and 77, MK Ultra, MK Naomi,
[00:37:47.489 --> 00:37:53.815]  And a whole other group of programs were declassified to a certain extent.
[00:37:53.815 --> 00:38:04.945]  Just the basics of the programs were released and almost all of it was blacked out.
[00:38:04.945 --> 00:38:07.847]  But this fits.
[00:38:07.847 --> 00:38:09.749]  It's always an Army officer.
[00:38:11.636 --> 00:38:15.360]  Look at the Beltway sniper about to be executed.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.202]  The Army, lived on Army bases.
[00:38:18.202 --> 00:38:23.087]  Witnesses saw white men in white vans shooting people over and over again, but these guys get caught.
[00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:27.952]  Turns out both of them had been under psychiatric care.
[00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:30.714]  That is a 95% chance that was staged.
[00:38:30.714 --> 00:38:35.539]  And if we went over that evidence, there's a lot of sites and articles have been written about it to make your head spin.
[00:38:36.846 --> 00:38:40.169]  And it's time and time again in these mind control programs.
[00:38:40.169 --> 00:38:48.295]  The strongest evidence that we can just quickly cover here is Timothy McVeigh.
[00:38:48.295 --> 00:38:53.739]  He's highly decorated in Gulf War I. He clearly gets sheep dipped.
[00:38:53.739 --> 00:38:55.801]  That's come out in federal documents.
[00:38:55.801 --> 00:38:58.363]  He goes out of the army into black ops.
[00:39:03.834 --> 00:39:30.830]  He ends up traveling all over the United States, interfacing with militias, interfacing with gun shows, interfacing with white supremacists, interfacing with the Branch Davidians, all these different groups to try to create a history so that when he was set up as a Patsy later, they could connect him to all these groups for political demonization.
[00:39:34.068 --> 00:39:58.412]  And the state police, an hour plus after the OKC bombing on April 19th, 1995, the state police see a large junker, big yellow junker car driving erratically.
[00:39:59.656 --> 00:40:05.518]  McVeigh pulls over, starts crawling around on the ground saying, it hurts, it hurts, tell them to stop, I got a chip.
[00:40:05.518 --> 00:40:14.741]  He's foaming at the mouth, throwing up, obviously drugged out of his gourd is what the state police said in the report, because they're not part of the conspiracy.
[00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:20.942]  He's got a gun on the dashboard and he's saying, get it out, get it out, I got a chip in my butt.
[00:40:20.942 --> 00:40:23.423]  Chip in my hip.
[00:40:23.423 --> 00:40:29.105]  They grab him, the feds take him, meanwhile the feds order state police
[00:40:30.441 --> 00:40:38.126]  in North Carolina to release the Iraqi Republican Guard members who later came out were CIA.
[00:40:38.126 --> 00:40:45.311]  They ordered them to release them even though they were trying to get on a plane with box cutters, wire, blue jumpsuits.
[00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:50.175]  They're ordered to be released under national security.
[00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:51.015]  Then it comes out the ADL
[00:40:53.464 --> 00:41:09.314]  Affiliated Southern Poverty Law Center, that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running Ellen Heem City where McVeigh was based out of, this white supremacist compound, that came out in FBI documents in lawsuits that the feds were ordered to release two years ago.
[00:41:09.314 --> 00:41:21.602]  All of that's going on, and then McVeigh is taken to Denver, Colorado, and the entire time, guess who his government-appointed psychiatrist is who stays with him
[00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:24.837]  Five days a week.
[00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:26.418]  He's not allowed to talk to the media.
[00:41:26.418 --> 00:41:31.764]  Guess who McVeigh's court-appointed psychiatrist is?
[00:41:31.764 --> 00:41:38.370]  It's Jolly and West, who was the US head of MKUltra with Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.711]  I mean, this is declassified.
[00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:44.376]  They have the king, the Mac Daddy of mind control.
[00:41:46.107 --> 00:42:14.081]  Somebody who took foster children, along with Dr. Ewing Cameron, I mean, they have History Channel specials about this, and would reprogram children and women and men to where they had a totally new identity and didn't know who they were, and he could snap his fingers and give them orders, and they would bark like a dog, they would shift into different personalities, they did it with PCP, LSD, shock therapy, peyote, six months in isolation tanks.
[00:42:14.081 --> 00:42:15.582]  10 minutes will drive most people crazy.
[00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:27.133]  In the salt isolation tanks, the temperature of the womb that makes the brain completely freak out, on hallucinogens with earphones on, giving them commands for six months at a time.
[00:42:27.133 --> 00:42:29.873]  I mean, total mind control slave.
[00:42:29.873 --> 00:42:36.735]  Guaranteed, declassified, that they can make a total Manchurian candidate.
[00:42:36.735 --> 00:42:36.855]  Now,
[00:42:37.873 --> 00:42:51.760]  The head of this program becomes McVeigh's doctor and is there with him many years later when he's executed in Terre Haute, Indiana at the Federal Execution Center.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.702]  By the way, Wes died two years ago, died a few years after that, after the execution.
[00:42:56.702 --> 00:43:05.587]  So the government thinks you're so stupid that they have the modern father of a total mind control system
[00:43:08.123 --> 00:43:11.129]  He was the twin head of it with Ewing Cameron.
[00:43:11.129 --> 00:43:15.838]  Dr. Ewing Cameron, Jolly and West, is the doctor of Tim McVeigh.
[00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:21.349]  You cannot make that type of stuff up.
[00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:27.314]  No one would believe a Hollywood script like that because people would say, the government wouldn't put the head of mind control over McVeigh.
[00:43:27.314 --> 00:43:30.017]  That's how stupid they think we are.
[00:43:30.017 --> 00:43:31.879]  So yes, there is mind control.
[00:43:31.879 --> 00:43:34.161]  And this guy's a psychiatrist.
[00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:38.405]  This guy's at Fort Hood, which is a major mind control facility.
[00:43:38.405 --> 00:43:40.107]  I'd have to say it's the biggest in the country.
[00:43:40.107 --> 00:43:41.728]  And we've listed it as the real
[00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:50.571]  Black Ops Command Center next to the Globalist Love multiple bases, but it's a twin base with Colorado Springs.
[00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:53.692]  Probably more important.
[00:43:53.692 --> 00:43:57.093]  They've got underground nuke bases under the mountains, underground railways.
[00:43:57.093 --> 00:44:00.994]  They got it all.
[00:44:00.994 --> 00:44:04.995]  I mean, this is Black Ops Central.
[00:44:04.995 --> 00:44:10.437]  Or he may just be a Prozac head who went crazy.
[00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:11.697]  Very small chance
[00:44:15.168 --> 00:44:19.369]  That he is a, quote, Muslim extremist and did it for these reasons.
[00:44:19.369 --> 00:44:22.230]  But notice he told people this.
[00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.231]  We're being told.
[00:44:25.231 --> 00:44:30.912]  And I can go on and on and on and on with mind control.
[00:44:30.912 --> 00:44:33.793]  But it's a conspiracy theory because people haven't looked at the facts.
[00:44:33.793 --> 00:44:36.314]  Just like Gulf of Tonkin in 1964, it was in the
[00:44:41.741 --> 00:44:50.567]  Major newspapers in Southern California, especially San Diego, that officers came back from the ships and said, this was very immoral, our ships were not attacked, this was staged.
[00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:55.530]  But see, people then read the article, told their friends about it, and decades later, it was just a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.131]  No, it was admitted.
[00:44:57.131 --> 00:45:02.295]  And then, four years ago, they declassified, okay, it's true, we staged it to get into the war.
[00:45:02.295 --> 00:45:06.818]  Well, it's the same thing with me saying, oh, John Lee and Wes, the head of mind control was McVeigh's doctor.
[00:45:07.577 --> 00:45:09.759]  You're not going to go look up the facts.
[00:45:09.759 --> 00:45:14.363]  You're going to tell your neighbor about it and they're going to laugh and say, oh, that Alex Jones.
[00:45:14.363 --> 00:45:15.284]  Oh, that Alex Jones.
[00:45:15.284 --> 00:45:18.566]  He says there was a government plan to fly jets into buildings and bomb D.C.
[00:45:18.566 --> 00:45:21.549]  and commit terror attacks called Operation Northwoods.
[00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:24.111]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:45:24.111 --> 00:45:27.394]  It's declassified ABC News, Baltimore Sun, Associated Press.
[00:45:28.902 --> 00:45:31.923]  Look, I wish this stuff wasn't true every day, okay?
[00:45:31.923 --> 00:45:33.384]  Think about doing this every day.
[00:45:33.384 --> 00:45:34.625]  I am sick of it.
[00:45:34.625 --> 00:45:36.565]  But I'm not delusional.
[00:45:36.565 --> 00:45:45.469]  I can't just not want to believe something so then I just wipe the slate clean and forget about it and go on about my business like this isn't true.
[00:45:45.469 --> 00:45:49.531]  So I don't know what happened at Fort Hood, but I'll tell you this, it stinks to high heaven.
[00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:55.534]  It's got every indicator, but the problem is a lot of the indicators mirror other scenarios.
[00:45:58.683 --> 00:46:02.665]  But having the media hype it the way they are, that's kind of the cherry on top.
[00:46:02.665 --> 00:46:04.747]  It could be mind control.
[00:46:04.747 --> 00:46:06.728]  He could be on Prozac.
[00:46:06.728 --> 00:46:08.749]  He'll be on that regardless if he's on mind control or not.
[00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:10.170]  That's part of it.
[00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.531]  You know, the public's under mind control.
[00:46:11.531 --> 00:46:13.031]  That's what the Prozac does.
[00:46:13.031 --> 00:46:15.053]  It puts you into a dream state.
[00:46:15.053 --> 00:46:17.674]  Into a highly suggestible, hypnotized state.
[00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:18.575]  It's like a truth serum.
[00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:23.305]  It's a programming serum, and 20% of the public and growing is on it.
[00:46:23.305 --> 00:46:30.929]  That's why you can't talk to them, because it's designed to put you under their total control when you watch the hypnotic television set.
[00:46:30.929 --> 00:46:35.371]  I mean, for heaven's sakes, ladies and gentlemen, they figured out how to control populations.
[00:46:36.664 --> 00:46:38.166]  Alright, I said I'd go back to your calls.
[00:46:38.166 --> 00:46:39.567]  Steve, you were bringing up mind control.
[00:46:39.567 --> 00:46:41.709]  I thought I'd do a bit of a treatise on that.
[00:46:41.709 --> 00:46:42.510]  Now, make your comment.
[00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:43.231]  Go ahead.
[00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:44.953]  Yeah, I appreciate you bringing that up, Alex.
[00:46:44.953 --> 00:46:54.483]  I just wanted to say, I heard, you know, before I get back to finishing this point up, I had heard that the same doctor you were talking about that was assigned to McVeigh was also assigned to Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:46:54.483 --> 00:46:54.984]  Yes, he was.
[00:46:55.524 --> 00:46:59.226]  Yeah, so, and people need, really need to get educated on this stuff.
[00:46:59.226 --> 00:47:17.735]  They have no understanding of how the, you know, the government, uh, corporate media controlled, you know, deal works, but, and controlling people, probably, I mean, but, I, the reason I say I believe this was a false flag terror attack, and I believe your intel's gonna bring us out ahead, all the classic signs, but here's one of the main ones.
[00:47:17.735 --> 00:47:23.659]  Do you remember what they are now saying this guy was yelling before he committed this act?
[00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:24.459]  Allah Akbar!
[00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:27.353]  Okay, and you brought this out.
[00:47:27.353 --> 00:47:31.355]  Real Muslims, when they're going to commit an act like this, they don't say Allah Akbar.
[00:47:31.355 --> 00:47:34.237]  And I can't remember if it was Allah, but it's something after that.
[00:47:34.237 --> 00:47:35.798]  It's not Akbar.
[00:47:35.798 --> 00:47:39.000]  That's not the thing that CA operatives say.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:50.027]  I mean, to paraphrase it, they say, and this is what they're supposed to say under their religious law, and I can pull up the actual quote, because some of the real hijackings and attacks, they actually say this.
[00:47:50.027 --> 00:47:50.507]  They say,
[00:47:52.318 --> 00:47:56.239]  Basically, Allah is God and his prophet is Muhammad.
[00:47:56.239 --> 00:47:57.379]  Right.
[00:47:57.379 --> 00:48:03.060]  You know, and I have to ask, why did the base commander report that this guy was dead?
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:09.722]  And also that it was not base police that killed him, but it was civilian.
[00:48:09.722 --> 00:48:18.143]  Well, that's the really good news here, but the problem is they've been caught lying or putting out disinformation on so many fronts that this could be another lie.
[00:48:18.143 --> 00:48:18.784]  Remember the
[00:48:21.783 --> 00:48:21.963]  Right.
[00:48:21.963 --> 00:48:22.303]  Right, right.
[00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:48.894]  And that's clearly in the record for anybody that looks at it, and his family knows that.
[00:48:48.894 --> 00:49:00.824]  But they're saying a civilian police officer, contractor, on base, a Kimberly Munley, got shot herself and shot him four times.
[00:49:00.824 --> 00:49:05.728]  The other officer with her was firing as well.
[00:49:05.728 --> 00:49:09.731]  And I'm not saying women aren't great shots and can't defend themselves and can't make good police officers.
[00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:11.833]  It's just the Pentagon has a fetish
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:21.223]  With lying about women engaged in heroics as part of their military recruiting drive for women.
[00:49:21.223 --> 00:49:22.764]  They want a draft of women that's been admitted.
[00:49:22.764 --> 00:49:24.885]  They've introduced the legislation.
[00:49:24.885 --> 00:49:29.087]  But they're saying that she heroically acted and acted very, very quickly.
[00:49:29.087 --> 00:49:33.409]  Here's a quote, really a pretty amazing aggressive performance by this police officer.
[00:49:33.409 --> 00:49:34.910]  And if it's true, great job to her.
[00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:41.233]  I mean, it was a female security guard at one of these churches.
[00:49:44.082 --> 00:49:51.227]  Who was packing heat when this nut went into that big church in Colorado and started trying to shoot people.
[00:49:51.227 --> 00:49:53.929]  And she killed him within seconds, so he only killed a couple people.
[00:49:54.989 --> 00:49:56.090]  So yeah, it's great.
[00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:57.651]  I want women with more guns.
[00:49:57.651 --> 00:50:07.239]  And normally the police, when the feds are in control, like Blacksburg and other places, they order them to stand down for hours so the shooter can do their business.
[00:50:07.239 --> 00:50:13.904]  And the men all put on 14 layers of body armor and strut around and don't know how to lace up their helmets and boots.
[00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.731]  Instead of just charging in and killing the person that's doing it.
[00:50:17.731 --> 00:50:21.952]  I mean, I'm not a macho person, but somebody's running around with a gun, killing people.
[00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:23.752]  I mean, I couldn't control myself.
[00:50:23.752 --> 00:50:28.353]  I would grab a firearm and immediately, you know, charge in.
[00:50:28.353 --> 00:50:31.194]  Probably without even having tactics.
[00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.914]  Because, I don't know, that's just how I'm wired.
[00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:37.895]  I mean, I'm not looking for a fight, but as soon as one starts, I can't control myself.
[00:50:37.895 --> 00:50:38.495]  I mean, I'm ready.
[00:50:38.495 --> 00:50:40.996]  I mean, once it starts happening, I like it.
[00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:48.048]  I don't know how they've castrated the men in this country to just turn them into complete cowards.
[00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:50.651]  But hey, this woman's obviously not a coward.
[00:50:50.651 --> 00:50:54.775]  Maybe the men can learn from her in future shooting situations.
[00:50:54.775 --> 00:50:55.696]  And I said she killed him.
[00:50:55.696 --> 00:50:56.697]  I'm going with the old story.
[00:50:56.697 --> 00:50:58.399]  She wounded him with four shots.
[00:50:58.399 --> 00:50:58.960]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:12.039 --> 00:51:13.126]  The answer is simple.
[00:51:13.126 --> 00:51:14.375]  Purebulk.com.
[00:51:16.232 --> 00:51:16.632]  We're good to go!
[00:51:47.133 --> 00:51:49.874]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:49.874 --> 00:51:52.894]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:52.894 --> 00:51:54.735]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:13.910]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:20.292]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.292 --> 00:52:25.834]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.834 --> 00:52:35.478]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.598 --> 00:52:37.940]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.522]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.522 --> 00:52:41.984]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.984 --> 00:52:44.106]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.106 --> 00:52:49.271]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:15.663]  Got some bad news for everybody.
[00:54:15.663 --> 00:54:21.609]  This is looking worse and worse by the minute as some type of false flag event.
[00:54:21.609 --> 00:54:26.594]  But you also have a lot of people losing their jobs under incredible stress.
[00:54:26.594 --> 00:54:27.675]  You've got veterans.
[00:54:28.973 --> 00:54:36.218]  We've served two, three, four tours that are completely mind-blown who are out there.
[00:54:36.218 --> 00:54:42.181]  Every time there's a mass shooting there are copycat shootings because it introduces the idea into people's minds.
[00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:45.604]  This is how you're supposed to respond to stress.
[00:54:45.604 --> 00:54:48.345]  Shootings in Orlando office building.
[00:54:48.345 --> 00:54:53.489]  Orlando police have responded to a possible shooting at an office building in downtown Orlando.
[00:54:54.372 --> 00:55:00.962]  And as of about two minutes ago, they're reporting that there are people down.
[00:55:00.962 --> 00:55:09.614]  In fact, that's the latest news that it's eight people down or eight people dead.
[00:55:09.614 --> 00:55:10.535]  Eight people shot.
[00:55:11.963 --> 00:55:17.885]  So we'll continue to watch this and see now people aren't worried about the government health care bill that's about to pass.
[00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:24.167]  They're not worried about an expansion of foreign banking power or the global carbon tax that's on the verge of passing.
[00:55:24.167 --> 00:55:26.928]  They're not worried about the dollar plunging and gold going above $1,100.
[00:55:26.928 --> 00:55:28.389]  $1,102 and surging to an all-time mega record.
[00:55:35.762 --> 00:55:38.283]  People aren't concerned about that now.
[00:55:38.283 --> 00:55:40.165]  No, the mass shootings have begun.
[00:55:40.165 --> 00:55:43.627]  And how many times did I say this year?
[00:55:43.627 --> 00:55:45.007]  How many times?
[00:55:45.007 --> 00:55:51.551]  I need to just get more staff just so we have somebody who marks down my predictions and so we record them so we have them.
[00:55:51.551 --> 00:55:54.833]  Listeners always find them on YouTube and in archives and post them.
[00:55:54.833 --> 00:56:01.077]  But how many times did I say in January they're going to have a staged flu hype and a mass shooting?
[00:56:01.077 --> 00:56:04.939]  A string of mass shootings around the country using Muslims.
[00:56:06.536 --> 00:56:22.883]  I said, in the cards, with the preparatory brainwashing that I've seen in the media and on the television shows and in the dramas, both fiction and non-fiction, they're getting us ready to have TSA-like security on the streets of America and the malls, on the highways.
[00:56:22.883 --> 00:56:25.245]  They want to put NORTHCOM on the streets.
[00:56:25.245 --> 00:56:28.086]  They're doing it incrementally.
[00:56:28.086 --> 00:56:34.409]  And if this continues, and if the MO is similar to Fort Hood, we are now entering
[00:56:35.524 --> 00:56:41.028]  As we get more information, an area where this is looking really suspicious.
[00:56:41.028 --> 00:56:42.389]  And I'm not the only one that's said this.
[00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:48.494]  Rush Limbaugh, for years, has pointed out why every time they're trying to pass anti-gun bills, there's suddenly mass shootings.
[00:56:48.494 --> 00:56:51.196]  And all of these things are suspicious.
[00:56:51.196 --> 00:56:55.399]  I mean, somebody shooting his wife, or shooting their neighbors, or shooting their boss is one thing.
[00:56:55.399 --> 00:57:02.525]  But when people just start running around blasting scores of people, and they're always on Prozac, they're always on Blacksburg, it doesn't matter.
[00:57:02.525 --> 00:57:03.846]  They're always on it!
[00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:09.598]  Kip Kinkle, Harris Kleibold, the Indian Reservation shootings.
[00:57:09.598 --> 00:57:19.205]  I mean, I have only found maybe one or two cases where they weren't on these drugs and then their medical records are sealed.
[00:57:19.205 --> 00:57:21.407]  So shootings in Orlando office building.
[00:57:30.219 --> 00:57:33.201]  This is what's being reported.
[00:57:33.201 --> 00:57:34.422]  They're on commercial right now.
[00:57:34.422 --> 00:57:43.329]  I was just going to pop in for a second and show people what CNN is saying, but they really have nothing to report.
[00:57:43.329 --> 00:57:53.937]  And all this is a distraction, but we are forced to cover it instead of the complete world government takeover, the record unemployment, and all these other big issues that are happening.
[00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:54.938]  Okay, I'm going to go to break.
[00:57:55.711 --> 00:58:00.634]  We're going to come back and then just callers, I know you got a lot of points to make, but I tend to then have long-winded answers.
[00:58:00.634 --> 00:58:02.195]  I want to get more people on air.
[00:58:02.195 --> 00:58:07.739]  Paul, Mike, Connie, Nikki, Kevin, just have your comments ready.
[00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:08.199]  Just make them.
[00:58:08.199 --> 00:58:10.941]  I'm going to the next person.
[00:58:10.941 --> 00:58:19.007]  And then we'll get into all the economic news and all the police state news and the demonization of the tea parties going on by the mainstream corporate media.
[00:58:19.007 --> 00:58:23.710]  Hour number two, three and four, straight ahead on this Friday.
[00:58:25.697 --> 00:58:27.858]  The 6th day of November 2009 edition.
[00:58:27.858 --> 00:58:29.459]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:58:29.459 --> 00:58:42.067]  Please don't forget the online video bookstore at Infowars.com with all the best titles of films and books, t-shirts and material to get the word out.
[00:58:42.067 --> 00:58:43.488]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.488 --> 00:58:46.750]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.148 --> 00:58:54.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:55.612]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.612 --> 00:58:59.035]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.035 --> 00:58:59.895]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.895 --> 00:59:04.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.779 --> 00:59:05.519]  It's true.
[00:59:05.519 --> 00:59:10.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.403 --> 00:59:11.224]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.224 --> 00:59:14.806]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.806 --> 00:59:18.509]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.709 --> 00:59:19.510]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:22.272]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.272 --> 00:59:25.955]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.955 --> 00:59:26.735]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.735 --> 00:59:30.878]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.878 --> 00:59:35.642]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.942 --> 00:59:40.104]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.104 --> 00:59:41.885]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.885 --> 00:59:44.146]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.146 --> 00:59:46.427]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.427 --> 00:59:47.147]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.147 --> 00:59:48.588]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:48.588 --> 00:59:48.948]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:08.218]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.218 --> 01:00:09.959]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.959 --> 01:00:11.560]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.460]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.303]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.303 --> 01:00:24.447]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.447 --> 01:00:34.153]  When you have a government with a strong documented history of mind control, namely mass shooters and lone gunmen,
[01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:38.690]  You are forced to look at it.
[01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:59.258]  But then you have a second tier of mind-controlled right at 20% of the population on psychotropic drugs in the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class that they admit in the drug inserts can cause psychotic breaks and mass killing and is intimately wed to almost all the major mass shootings.
[01:00:59.258 --> 01:01:02.339]  That's another form of mind-controlled.
[01:01:03.737 --> 01:01:05.498]  That we see.
[01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:09.460]  Or, this individual could just be another nutty psychiatrist.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.660]  How many times have they been caught raping their patients?
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.082]  How many times have they been caught killing their families?
[01:01:14.082 --> 01:01:16.222]  Why do they have the highest suicide rate?
[01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:18.984]  Why do they have one of the highest mass shooting rates?
[01:01:18.984 --> 01:01:26.327]  This is a very disgusting guild of people, on average, and that could be the case, or he could be a Muslim crazy.
[01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:34.006]  We don't know, but now there's been another mass shooting starting in Orlando, Florida in an office building.
[01:01:34.006 --> 01:01:36.208]  We'll give you more on this as it develops.
[01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:37.710]  Let's talk to Paul in Oregon.
[01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:39.571]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.793]  Thanks for having me.
[01:01:40.793 --> 01:01:42.815]  You bet.
[01:01:42.815 --> 01:01:48.801]  I wouldn't be surprised if we see three or four more mass shootings or something similar to the DC sniper.
[01:01:50.245 --> 01:02:00.371]  You have been telling us for a while now that we are going to be making that switch in the next month or so to the world government or the banking regulations.
[01:02:00.371 --> 01:02:02.193]  They're not going to be covering that.
[01:02:02.193 --> 01:02:04.634]  Paul, let me ask you this because I wish I had the clips ready.
[01:02:04.634 --> 01:02:15.702]  How many times in the last six, eight months have I said they're going to stage mass shootings and if you see a whole bunch of them together, you know it's staged, especially if they're military or involved in psychiatry.
[01:02:15.702 --> 01:02:17.823]  I mean, that's exactly what I say.
[01:02:17.823 --> 01:02:19.084]  And then what do you see happening?
[01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.566]  It doesn't look good.
[01:02:21.566 --> 01:02:24.589]  You've said it several times.
[01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:26.111]  I also wanted to make a point.
[01:02:26.111 --> 01:02:28.433]  We were talking about mind control.
[01:02:28.433 --> 01:02:29.774]  I don't know if you've seen these.
[01:02:29.774 --> 01:02:36.461]  They're getting the kids ready nowadays for this stuff, you know, to be plugged into the functional MRIs and things like that.
[01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.783]  There's a toy on the market called the MindFlex.
[01:02:38.783 --> 01:02:39.464]  Have you seen that?
[01:02:40.202 --> 01:03:05.157]  Yes, they've got a bunch of games where children hook into wires and interface their brain, and brain scanning's wonderful, and spy toys to spy on your parents, and lots of the Playmobil and Lego toys are all about checkpoints and searching people and police dogs, and most of the new toy soldiers say UN on the sides of the vehicle, USA's been removed.
[01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:05.598]  It's bad.
[01:03:05.598 --> 01:03:09.020]  And it's conditioning, right?
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:09.220]  Yes.
[01:03:10.465 --> 01:03:12.246]  They're just conditioning us.
[01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:16.229]  I also wanted to make a point that we are getting through to people, Alex.
[01:03:16.229 --> 01:03:23.114]  I'm a part of a martial arts community online, and part of that community talks about things like what you talk about.
[01:03:23.114 --> 01:03:36.723]  We do bring up things, and we show people your films, and there's a police officer on here that was being briefed yesterday about needing to take the swine flu shot, and he basically just raised the question that, you know, this hasn't been tested.
[01:03:36.723 --> 01:03:38.564]  I mean, what are they putting in this vaccine?
[01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:48.258]  He could tell that, you know, there are several officers there that are not going to be taking the shot, and he just made point to them that, you know, if everyone's sick, are we easier to control?
[01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.142]  And they all kind of just...
[01:03:51.807 --> 01:04:06.315]  Yeah, everybody who's got any instincts or any discernment and who has done any intellectual research knows something's wrong.
[01:04:06.315 --> 01:04:08.296]  I mean, bad stuff's going on.
[01:04:08.296 --> 01:04:13.740]  Everybody has this ominous feeling, and it's not Al Qaeda that's got us scared, folks, whether you believe in that or not.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.709]  Everybody knows it's the government, it's the corporations, it's what they're putting in the water.
[01:04:19.709 --> 01:04:26.941]  I mean, we have a government that admits they spike the water with chemicals to brain damage us, give us cancer, and sterilize us.
[01:04:27.802 --> 01:04:29.443]  I mean, they admit it!
[01:04:29.443 --> 01:04:31.664]  So, how do we trust anything they do?
[01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:33.125]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:34.426]  Good points, Paul.
[01:04:34.426 --> 01:04:37.748]  Mike, Connie, Nikki, Kevin, many others, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:38.028]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:38.028 --> 01:04:43.131]  Got three guests coming up today.
[01:04:43.131 --> 01:04:44.972]  Bob Chapman on the economy.
[01:04:44.972 --> 01:04:50.175]  A news reporter about the Army arresting regular citizens out on the streets of America.
[01:04:51.357 --> 01:04:55.878]  We've got a reporter coming on about Goldman Sachs and their chicanery.
[01:04:55.878 --> 01:04:58.099]  Very important broadcast on this Friday edition.
[01:04:58.099 --> 01:05:00.460]  Please stay with us.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:08.202]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[01:05:08.202 --> 01:05:14.284]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:05:14.284 --> 01:05:16.945]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:05:17.245 --> 01:05:23.510]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:27.593]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:27.593 --> 01:05:32.897]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:05:33.197 --> 01:05:35.279]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:05:35.279 --> 01:05:37.041]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:39.563]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:05:39.563 --> 01:05:44.288]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:48.011]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:51.134]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:51.134 --> 01:05:53.016]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:55.138]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:04.972]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:04.972 --> 01:06:08.555]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.555 --> 01:06:13.359]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:19.744]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.744 --> 01:06:21.986]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.526 --> 01:06:22.826]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:22.826 --> 01:06:23.327]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:24.007]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.007 --> 01:06:25.288]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.288 --> 01:06:27.529]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:48.701]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:57.806]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:08.915]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:08.915 --> 01:07:12.298]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.298 --> 01:07:18.163]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:22.947]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:22.947 --> 01:07:25.289]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:25.469 --> 01:07:25.869]  Thank you.
[01:07:44.383 --> 01:07:48.107]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:50.289]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.
[01:07:50.289 --> 01:07:56.816]  Or call about OxySilver, ZeoLife, and GI Flora Pro toll-free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:07:56.816 --> 01:07:58.998]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:07:58.998 --> 01:08:01.120]  Do it now.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.666]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:22.597]  CNN and the Associated Press are both reporting at least eight people shot in a downtown Orlando high-rise.
[01:08:22.597 --> 01:08:28.384]  The police are dressed up in army-style uniforms.
[01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:30.406]  Southeast Asian camo.
[01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.467]  Completely ridiculous.
[01:08:33.325 --> 01:08:41.632]  Because they like to play soldier and the government wants to acclimate everyone to troops on the streets so that they're indistinguishable, just like what we saw at the G20.
[01:08:41.632 --> 01:08:53.441]  Police dressed like military, military dressed like police, riding around with sound cannons, shooting people with it for no reason, and attacking old women with police dogs, completely out of control.
[01:08:53.441 --> 01:09:02.408]  And they're just milling around, putting on all sorts of combat gear, and the witnesses have identified a man in a blue polo shirt,
[01:09:03.692 --> 01:09:04.232]  I think?
[01:09:29.016 --> 01:09:32.758]  Nadal Hassan four times and not killing him though.
[01:09:32.758 --> 01:09:45.566]  They said for six hours he'd been killed and now they're saying he wasn't killed and then they're saying there were two other shooters but now there weren't.
[01:09:45.566 --> 01:09:57.354]  If it is true this female police officer killed this guy before the feds could get control and tell everybody to stand down, can you imagine how many more people this Fruit Loop would have killed?
[01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.673]  I don't know, anybody comes around here trying to have a mass shooting, I'm gonna fight.
[01:10:05.673 --> 01:10:06.813]  Got a firearm right here.
[01:10:06.813 --> 01:10:09.414]  Right beside me on the radio.
[01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.275]  Not playing games.
[01:10:12.486 --> 01:10:15.188]  The answer is more guns, less crime.
[01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:15.948]  Look at Chicago.
[01:10:15.948 --> 01:10:16.849]  Look at New York.
[01:10:16.849 --> 01:10:18.450]  Look at their higher crime rates.
[01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:23.634]  Connie, Nikki, Kevin, Michael, and others, we're going to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:10:23.634 --> 01:10:31.099]  After I take those calls, I do want to say today that I want to let some first-time callers get involved as well.
[01:10:31.099 --> 01:10:34.161]  A lot of these people are first-time but are not frequent callers.
[01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:36.963]  We want people to be able to get involved on air with us.
[01:10:36.963 --> 01:10:38.264]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:53.347]  But I wanted to, just for three or four minutes, we may have him pop back in when Bob Chapman joins us next hour.
[01:10:53.347 --> 01:10:56.228]  I wanted to have Ted on because this is a big day.
[01:10:56.228 --> 01:11:03.510]  The dollar continues to drop, even though the IMF put hundreds of billions of dollars of gold on the market trying to drive the price down earlier in the week.
[01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:12.912]  It's gone above $1,102 today, and I wanted Ted to be able to give us, as a 30-year gold broker and the owner of Midas Resources, his view on this.
[01:11:12.912 --> 01:11:16.233]  Ted, briefly, what's your take on what's happening with gold right now?
[01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:22.955]  Well, I think you have an appropriate name for your latest documentary, Fall of the Republic.
[01:11:22.955 --> 01:11:25.055]  The dollar's falling again today.
[01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:30.657]  Gold has gone up over $1,100 to $1,102.
[01:11:30.657 --> 01:11:37.559]  We have unemployment figures now coming out at 10.2%, and that's the government-reported figures.
[01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.979]  That's horrible.
[01:11:39.979 --> 01:11:42.720]  That's just a terrible economy.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.321]  Chapman says it's really more like 20%.
[01:11:46.377 --> 01:11:50.218]  Alex, if they factor everything in, it's well over 20%.
[01:11:50.218 --> 01:11:51.998]  You know, people know that.
[01:11:51.998 --> 01:11:55.999]  But, again, it's just another nail in the coffin to the United States.
[01:11:55.999 --> 01:11:57.819]  Well, there's also the underemployed people.
[01:11:57.819 --> 01:12:06.841]  I mean, most people I know, even with good degrees, have got two, three jobs, just trying to pay all the stinking taxes and... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:09.462]  Yeah, no, that's okay, because your point is well taken.
[01:12:09.929 --> 01:12:21.600]  I mean, the taxes are going up because we continue to have to pay more money back to this monstrous Federal Reserve System that lends us the money in order to have currency.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.783]  All I can say, Alex, is what would you prefer to have?
[01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:29.539]  Fiat paper currency, or would you rather have gold and silver?
[01:12:29.539 --> 01:12:33.940]  Now, the United States government was set up to have gold and silver as money.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:38.801]  We, the people of the United States as miners, were creating the currency.
[01:12:38.801 --> 01:12:40.161]  We were making it.
[01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:42.602]  We owed it to nobody after we did.
[01:12:42.602 --> 01:12:44.902]  There was no debt associated with it.
[01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:47.843]  This country is being drawn into the sea of debt.
[01:12:48.783 --> 01:12:59.288]  And this is exactly what Thomas Jefferson was warning about when the first central bank was being put together.
[01:12:59.288 --> 01:13:01.630]  And here we have it right here.
[01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:04.351]  They laid it out for us and we've screwed it up.
[01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:13.736]  We let this Federal Reserve System come in in 1913 and now we're so far into a sea of debt that not even foreign nations want to hold on to our currency anymore.
[01:13:13.736 --> 01:13:15.397]  Sad, sad, sad.
[01:13:15.397 --> 01:13:17.418]  And it's all about this republic failing.
[01:13:18.399 --> 01:13:30.935]  You know, without a change to that system, we're going to continue to stay on the same road that we're on, Alex, and I just can't tell you enough that it just makes me feel sick to my stomach, and it should to everybody who's listening to this show.
[01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:49.195]  Well, you know, Ted, that's what's frustrating about this is we should feel really good in the last six years telling people that we think buying gold is a good investment, a good hedge against inflation, saying that the globalists plan to tank the dollar, kill the republic to bring in world government.
[01:13:49.195 --> 01:13:51.217]  I mean, we were reading their own documents.
[01:13:51.217 --> 01:13:59.183]  All we were doing was telling people what they said, being laughed at, being ridiculed, being attacked, still being attacked as it's all openly announced.
[01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:06.512]  And we should feel really good about the fact that we told people to buy gold when it was below $300 an ounce.
[01:14:06.512 --> 01:14:09.656]  What was the low?
[01:14:09.656 --> 01:14:10.097]  $270 something?
[01:14:10.097 --> 01:14:10.557]  What was it, Ted?
[01:14:10.557 --> 01:14:11.138]  $248 at its bottom.
[01:14:11.138 --> 01:14:11.699]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:14:11.699 --> 01:14:11.919]  Okay.
[01:14:11.919 --> 01:14:12.139]  Okay, $248.
[01:14:12.139 --> 01:14:14.522]  And telling people to buy it then,
[01:14:19.147 --> 01:14:23.791]  And then now it's $1,102 plus and rising.
[01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:25.373]  And I don't feel good, Ted.
[01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:32.279]  I don't feel good that I've been right about all this and people know me all over the world and everybody tells me, oh, great job.
[01:14:32.279 --> 01:14:36.383]  Because at the end of the day, we still got the same crooks running things.
[01:14:36.383 --> 01:14:38.465]  My children's future is in deep trouble.
[01:14:40.107 --> 01:14:50.339]  I mean, we can handle just being a third world country and falling apart, but we're going to have tyranny and spies and corrupt bureaucrats that are only going to raise more taxes on us.
[01:14:50.339 --> 01:14:51.580]  They're just not going to stop.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.223]  I mean, this is really a bad tyranny we're dealing with.
[01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:57.269]  And it actually makes it sick.
[01:14:57.269 --> 01:15:00.493]  It actually makes me nauseous to be right.
[01:15:00.493 --> 01:15:03.177]  I wish every day I was wrong.
[01:15:03.177 --> 01:15:06.421]  I wish this guy was a Muslim extremist.
[01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:12.208]  I wish that was real, because that's a lot less scary than criminals running the government that would set stuff up like this.
[01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:16.151]  I wish every day 9-11 was an outside job.
[01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:18.634]  I wish every day the Army was good.
[01:15:18.634 --> 01:15:20.896]  I wish every day the police were good.
[01:15:20.896 --> 01:15:23.278]  I wish every day none of this was true!
[01:15:23.278 --> 01:15:24.599]  Believe me!
[01:15:24.599 --> 01:15:26.861]  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:29.023]  I'm just some redneck from Texas!
[01:15:29.023 --> 01:15:34.028]  You think I like having to sit here and know that the idiot public
[01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:35.716]  Well, there you go.
[01:15:53.918 --> 01:15:58.920]  Just right on target, because right now we're watching the value of our currency drop.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:07.183]  I mean, we have lost about 40% of the value of the United States currency within the last couple of years alone.
[01:16:07.183 --> 01:16:12.685]  I mean, if you go back to 1971, since gold has been separated from the U.S.
[01:16:12.685 --> 01:16:13.925]  dollar, it's worth about 18 cents.
[01:16:16.086 --> 01:16:17.727]  I mean, 18 cents.
[01:16:17.727 --> 01:16:24.210]  Put a hundred pennies in front of you and then take all but 18 of them and throw them in the garbage can, because that's what happened.
[01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:26.251]  What do you think the trend is going to be in the future?
[01:16:26.251 --> 01:16:29.153]  Do you want to wait until it's worth two cents?
[01:16:29.153 --> 01:16:35.856]  I mean, the type of economy and the way that we're trying to solve our problems is identified.
[01:16:35.856 --> 01:16:41.799]  You can pretty much set it right against what happened in Argentina, in Brazil.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:49.566]  In Zimbabwe and the issue here is this is not an accident or a mistake.
[01:16:49.566 --> 01:16:51.188]  They're not screwing up.
[01:16:51.188 --> 01:16:53.530]  We have the internal Goldman Sachs documents.
[01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:55.192]  We have the Federal Reserve documents.
[01:16:55.192 --> 01:16:58.255]  We have the Maury Strong quotes, the UN documents.
[01:16:58.255 --> 01:17:04.002]  I hear them brag on NPR scores of times over the years when my wife has it on making dinner.
[01:17:04.502 --> 01:17:10.784]  Where they brag about globalization will be good and carbon tax will be good to teach us to live with less.
[01:17:10.784 --> 01:17:13.305]  Yeah, with these control freaks running our lives.
[01:17:13.305 --> 01:17:15.346]  It's by design.
[01:17:15.346 --> 01:17:18.007]  Get that through your head ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:18.007 --> 01:17:19.727]  That's what Fall of the Republic covers.
[01:17:19.727 --> 01:17:21.888]  That's why it's such an important film.
[01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:24.769]  This is being done by design.
[01:17:24.769 --> 01:17:26.670]  That means it can be stopped.
[01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:34.254]  It'd be one thing if we were all just a bunch of idiots and the government were idiots and the banks were morons and, oh gosh, we really screwed up.
[01:17:34.254 --> 01:17:35.575]  It'd be a lot harder to fix.
[01:17:35.575 --> 01:17:36.395]  No!
[01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:38.096]  This is artificial!
[01:17:38.096 --> 01:17:48.361]  We've got industrial base, we've got science, we've got technology, we've got the people globally to build an incredible society if we could get rid of these parasites.
[01:17:48.361 --> 01:17:51.163]  And they're sucking the lifeblood out of our economy.
[01:17:51.343 --> 01:17:54.045]  Because they're threatened by a true free market.
[01:17:54.045 --> 01:18:06.077]  The big money wants a monopoly and they want to kill capitalism and kill the free market and blame their crimes on it as they bring in their world socialist government where they take our money and give it to the bankers.
[01:18:06.077 --> 01:18:07.598]  Now listen, Ted, we're almost out of time.
[01:18:07.598 --> 01:18:09.520]  I want to come back and start going to calls.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.521]  But please tell folks
[01:18:11.181 --> 01:18:13.923]  What, what is your, what is the gold and silver you've got now?
[01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:15.745]  What, what level of the market?
[01:18:15.745 --> 01:18:17.566]  It was 920 the last, I mean, 1,020 level.
[01:18:17.566 --> 01:18:19.127]  A few weeks ago it was 920.
[01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.488]  It was a 1,020 level.
[01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:22.590]  It's hard to keep track of it, really, you know.
[01:18:27.113 --> 01:18:31.917]  You said you were about to run out of gold and silver that you bought when the markets were at the $1,020 level.
[01:18:31.917 --> 01:18:34.619]  It's now at the $1,102 level, so up over $80 in the last week or so.
[01:18:34.619 --> 01:18:34.839]  So, Ted?
[01:18:34.839 --> 01:18:37.101]  Well, here's what I have to offer, Alex.
[01:18:37.101 --> 01:18:40.063]  I have the same prices as I did yesterday, which was
[01:18:50.835 --> 01:18:55.502]  I can tell you it's way out of the prices as far as where the market should be.
[01:18:55.502 --> 01:18:59.047]  Presently, right now, I have Franks at $238.
[01:18:59.047 --> 01:19:00.630]  Sovereigns at $293.
[01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:02.552]  I have Lakota Nation coins.
[01:19:02.552 --> 01:19:03.614]  Those are the silver coins.
[01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:03.834]  They're at $22.30.
[01:19:06.017 --> 01:19:07.958]  Walking Liberty Halves at $8.69.
[01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:14.140]  I have a plethora of Eagles and Maple Leafs and all sorts of junk silver.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.061]  You know, we carry it all.
[01:19:16.061 --> 01:19:23.184]  But what I'm telling you is that this material was purchased back when gold was much lower in price.
[01:19:23.184 --> 01:19:24.364]  You can buy it now.
[01:19:24.364 --> 01:19:26.085]  Gold has now gone up another
[01:19:26.585 --> 01:19:27.066]  We're good.
[01:19:42.699 --> 01:19:45.420]  You can go back in time and buy it when it was less.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.381]  It's a great deal.
[01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:47.081]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:50.823]  Here's that number again.
[01:19:50.823 --> 01:19:52.263]  Ted can hold it till midnight.
[01:19:52.263 --> 01:19:53.784]  Tell him it's the Alex Jones special.
[01:19:53.784 --> 01:19:54.364]  Take advantage.
[01:19:54.364 --> 01:19:54.544]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.544 --> 01:20:00.187]  Ted, thanks for the economic information.
[01:20:00.187 --> 01:20:00.867]  You're right.
[01:20:00.867 --> 01:20:01.848]  The once mighty U.S.
[01:20:01.848 --> 01:20:04.869]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:07.530]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:09.331]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into
[01:20:09.531 --> 01:20:10.112]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.773 --> 01:20:39.575]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.

[01:21:07.509 --> 01:21:10.372]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.372 --> 01:21:15.018]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.

[01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:41.241]  I think so.
[01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:04.672]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[01:23:00.831 --> 01:23:05.336]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:23:05.336 --> 01:23:09.601]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[01:23:09.601 --> 01:23:20.452]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:23:20.452 --> 01:23:22.975]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune
[01:23:23.015 --> 01:23:23.375]  I think so.

[01:24:10.021 --> 01:24:11.402]  Let's go to Connie in Illinois.
[01:24:11.402 --> 01:24:12.342]  Thanks for holding, Connie.
[01:24:12.342 --> 01:24:12.882]  You're on the air.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.441]  That's Alex.
[01:24:16.441 --> 01:24:18.442]  Two things.
[01:24:18.442 --> 01:24:22.524]  One is something from yesterday.
[01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:28.107]  Just before your last guest yesterday, you had an Englishman that was speaking to a U.S.
[01:24:28.107 --> 01:24:29.388]  audience.
[01:24:29.388 --> 01:24:37.592]  And I was wondering what was that man's name and what was the bill that he was referring to because there was no reference to it after or before that.
[01:24:37.592 --> 01:24:39.373]  Yes, that's Lord Moncton.
[01:24:41.107 --> 01:24:42.908]  And he is Monckton.
[01:24:42.908 --> 01:24:44.629]  He's a Viscount.
[01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:46.450]  He's from England.
[01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:49.492]  And we've done multiple radio shows on it.
[01:24:49.492 --> 01:24:52.694]  It is the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[01:24:52.694 --> 01:24:56.136]  I've done an entire hour just on the treaty.
[01:24:56.136 --> 01:24:58.597]  And everything he says is in there is in there.
[01:24:58.597 --> 01:25:01.379]  But you don't have to believe Lord Monckton.
[01:25:01.379 --> 01:25:09.424]  Ban Ki-moon a week and a half ago, two Sundays ago, wrote a global editorial published in hundreds of papers, including the New York Times.
[01:25:10.643 --> 01:25:15.225]  His editorial was on the front page, calling for global government.
[01:25:15.225 --> 01:25:18.527]  He said, we need a global government, the carbon tax will fund it.
[01:25:18.527 --> 01:25:23.489]  And then the media attacks Lord Monckton, calling him a kook, when he reads the treaty.
[01:25:23.489 --> 01:25:28.512]  But then separately, Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, says it's global government.
[01:25:28.512 --> 01:25:33.074]  So, it's mind-boggling.
[01:25:34.693 --> 01:25:48.816]  Okay, so in reference to it, here in the States, though, at this point, it's just simply the Framework Convention for Climate Change, and that's not actually either a Senate or a House bill at this point.
[01:25:48.816 --> 01:25:58.298]  The Framework Convention on Climate Change is the international agreement that countries have passed or are passing laws that mirror it and go under its control.
[01:25:58.298 --> 01:26:00.479]  So, if you actually read the legislation,
[01:26:02.338 --> 01:26:13.524]  What the House has passed is even worse than this, because the House is complying, and now the Senate's poised to pass it, with international law.
[01:26:13.524 --> 01:26:13.985]  You understand?
[01:26:13.985 --> 01:26:26.492]  In fact, this whole treaty talks about nation-states and regions mirroring or bringing their laws into harmony, into line with the UN Treaty.
[01:26:27.619 --> 01:26:31.020]  I understand that, but do you know what the Senate bill number is?
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.461]  You know, I don't have it in front of me, but it's just everywhere.
[01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:47.284]  I mean, it's the climate change bill, and I don't happen to have it memorized, but it's just... Actually, let me see if Reuters gives us the bill number.
[01:26:47.284 --> 01:26:47.804]  That's the problem.
[01:26:47.804 --> 01:26:49.045]  The mainstream media never does that.
[01:26:49.045 --> 01:26:52.206]  It's a Senate panel approves Democratic climate bill.
[01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:53.086]  This is yesterday.
[01:26:54.221 --> 01:26:54.901]  A key U.S.
[01:26:54.901 --> 01:27:04.824]  Senate Environment Committee approved a Democratic climate bill on Thursday that would require industry to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by at least 20 percent.
[01:27:04.824 --> 01:27:13.566]  The bill approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee will now become one of several initiatives in the Senate aimed at attacking global warming.
[01:27:13.566 --> 01:27:16.607]  So no, I don't have the bill number, ma'am.
[01:27:16.607 --> 01:27:17.407]  Checked out.
[01:27:17.407 --> 01:27:18.808]  And then in reference to the shooter,
[01:27:20.393 --> 01:27:47.036]  Yesterday, when the information broke, and I was listening to a Christian radio station at the time, the thought that came to my mind was that it was a staged thing, and that it was going to be used in terms of fear mongering against militia, not militia, but against the military.
[01:27:48.159 --> 01:28:03.791]  So that they indeed will be put on a terrorist watch list and can then have their guns taken away from them, because after all, the military is crazy, right?
[01:28:03.791 --> 01:28:06.293]  So anyway, that was just my thought on that.
[01:28:06.293 --> 01:28:14.679]  And for people that are new to listening and they're just wondering if what you're saying is crazy or not,
[01:28:17.377 --> 01:28:21.160]  It's so easy to do a web search just to look up simple things.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.962]  For example, Rockefeller's and eugenics.
[01:28:23.962 --> 01:28:32.468]  When you put that in there, there are tens of thousands of replies that come up.
[01:28:32.468 --> 01:28:43.996]  I just went to two of them, and one of them was talking about MKUltra and the psychiatry that was being developed.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:56.528]  In England, being transported to the United States to bring the United States under the subservience of... Yes, the Tavistock Institute, and I appreciate your call.
[01:28:56.528 --> 01:28:58.410]  Really a lot of great points from Connie.
[01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:01.672]  We're gonna get to Nikki, Kevin, Michael, Nick, and others.
[01:29:01.672 --> 01:29:08.457]  I've got a guest coming on for about 10 minutes about the military out arresting people off of bases, tasering an 81-year-old man.
[01:29:10.543 --> 01:29:22.287]  But it's one thing to read millions of websites talking about the Rockefellers being the masters of this whole system, or being the prime movers behind it, the real workhorses.
[01:29:22.287 --> 01:29:28.328]  But then I have Dr. Blaylock on, and all the other scientists, and they actually quote the documents.
[01:29:28.328 --> 01:29:34.130]  And the Rockefellers are the fathers of eugenics, that's in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:36.691]  They are the people that
[01:29:37.967 --> 01:29:38.788]  We're on the march.
[01:29:38.788 --> 01:29:39.929]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:39.929 --> 01:29:42.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:04.127]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.127 --> 01:30:09.452]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.452 --> 01:30:11.493]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.493 --> 01:30:16.498]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.498 --> 01:30:17.419]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.659 --> 01:30:18.800]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.681]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:21.762]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.762 --> 01:30:23.963]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.963 --> 01:30:25.304]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.304 --> 01:30:26.825]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.825 --> 01:30:32.089]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.089 --> 01:30:35.671]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.671 --> 01:30:39.154]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.494 --> 01:30:40.715]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.715 --> 01:30:41.615]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.615 --> 01:30:42.716]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.716 --> 01:30:43.656]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.656 --> 01:30:44.757]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.757 --> 01:30:47.799]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:07.118 --> 01:31:08.379]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:31:08.379 --> 01:31:09.199]  It's very real.
[01:31:09.199 --> 01:31:11.441]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:31:11.441 --> 01:31:13.102]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:05.189]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:09.716]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.716 --> 01:32:12.000]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.622]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.622 --> 01:32:14.664]  There is a solution.
[01:32:14.884 --> 01:32:23.313]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:33:01.866 --> 01:33:07.690]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:12.513]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:12.513 --> 01:33:17.696]  Your phone calls are coming up in about ten minutes here on this Friday edition.
[01:33:17.696 --> 01:33:21.399]  We've got new developments on the Orlando office building.
[01:33:21.399 --> 01:33:23.560]  Shooting at least eight shot.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.402]  The gunman is still on the loose.
[01:33:26.402 --> 01:33:27.383]  Is this a copycat?
[01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.932]  The tragedy we just saw at Fort Hood.
[01:33:30.932 --> 01:33:44.450]  We'll break down all the latest info on that, but we've been following in Texas, in California, in New York, Alabama, regular Army, regular Marines, National Guard,
[01:33:45.822 --> 01:34:04.286]  Sometimes 10, 15, 20 miles from a base, setting up checkpoints, helping police search for drunk drivers, as part of a PR campaign to acclimate the public to accept NORTHCOM, not just federal police, but federal troops policing America, and that's even in the Army Times.
[01:34:04.286 --> 01:34:06.066]  And we see more and more of these reports.
[01:34:06.066 --> 01:34:10.487]  This is out of Fairbanks, Alaska, and we've checked.
[01:34:10.487 --> 01:34:11.827]  It is a state highway.
[01:34:13.707 --> 01:34:17.889]  But now the military's spinning it and saying, well, that's part of the base, even though it's not their property.
[01:34:17.889 --> 01:34:20.010]  They're allowed to go out on the highway.
[01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:23.632]  And so they're just setting precedent here.
[01:34:23.632 --> 01:34:33.117]  And they pulled over this 81-year-old individual, said that he ran from him and tasered him.
[01:34:33.117 --> 01:34:38.940]  So I thought we would get the Fairbanks Newsminer reporter on.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:42.882]  That's the mainstream paper there in Fairbanks, the daily paper, the Newsminer.
[01:34:44.384 --> 01:34:54.592]  And we are joined by Chris Freiberg to break down what's happening there in Fairbanks with the Air Force base.
[01:34:54.592 --> 01:35:05.379]  In this case, that would be Air Force police, but we see the Army doing it in other areas, coming out off of base and tasering 81-year-olds.
[01:35:05.379 --> 01:35:07.481]  Thanks for joining us, Chris.
[01:35:07.481 --> 01:35:08.802]  Oh, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:35:09.933 --> 01:35:14.847]  An interesting article titled, 81-year-old tasered by Ellison Air Force Base Police.
[01:35:14.847 --> 01:35:16.591]  Tell us what really happened here.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:25.923]  Well, I've talked to Eielson and they said it's under investigation and they can't really talk about it.
[01:35:25.923 --> 01:35:31.446]  I talked to the 81-year-old, his name is Glenn Wilcox, he's an Episcopalian priest.
[01:35:31.446 --> 01:35:41.770]  He told me that he was going down the highway, this is a public highway maintained by the state, that the Air Force pulled him over for
[01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:43.831]  Going 11 miles over.
[01:35:43.831 --> 01:35:48.495]  He may or may not have wanted to accept the traffic ticket.
[01:35:48.495 --> 01:35:49.296]  That's not clear.
[01:35:49.296 --> 01:35:53.920]  He thought he had been waved off to go ahead.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.000]  He took off.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.004]  The Air Force police said that that was not the case.
[01:35:59.004 --> 01:36:01.406]  They called in the state troopers, took off after him.
[01:36:02.046 --> 01:36:05.987]  Describe this area to us geographically, please, and the name of the state highway.
[01:36:27.098 --> 01:36:29.999]  This is called the Richardson Highway.
[01:36:29.999 --> 01:36:31.999]  It's one of the major highways in the state.
[01:36:31.999 --> 01:36:34.840]  We don't have all that many of them.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:40.222]  This is a little past Fairbanks, about 20 miles down the road.
[01:36:40.222 --> 01:36:45.523]  There's a couple of miles that are right next to the base.
[01:36:45.523 --> 01:36:49.324]  I always thought it was patrolled by the state.
[01:36:49.324 --> 01:36:53.345]  The Air Force says that they have the right to do it.
[01:36:53.345 --> 01:36:55.886]  They're claiming that it's their highway too now.
[01:36:57.935 --> 01:37:14.241]  Have you had a chance to talk to the state police or others because I just pulled it up a few days ago on Google Maps and at first people were asking why were they off base doing this now they're just saying look we can do whatever we want we don't need no stinking badges or we don't need any stinking jurisdiction and then
[01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.790]  The fact that he pulled over the first time.
[01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:18.971]  We talked to him on the phone.
[01:37:18.971 --> 01:37:24.334]  I don't want to say he sounds senile, but he sounded a bit out of it.
[01:37:24.334 --> 01:37:26.256]  You know, he's an 81-year-old person.
[01:37:26.256 --> 01:37:33.180]  He leaves, and then they pull him over again, hold him for hours and hours.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.501]  Too much time on their hands.
[01:37:35.501 --> 01:37:37.262]  I would imagine he's already getting cold up there.
[01:37:37.262 --> 01:37:39.664]  I would imagine it's already pretty cold up in Alaska.
[01:37:39.664 --> 01:37:41.185]  Oh yeah, it's been below freezing lately.
[01:37:42.935 --> 01:37:48.940]  And so I guess he didn't like sitting out on the side of the highway while they sat in their warm patrol cars, and then they tasered him?
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.683]  How did all this end?
[01:37:52.683 --> 01:38:00.650]  Well, he said that because of his advanced age and he has a lot of health problems, he said he's had a quadruple bypass.
[01:38:00.650 --> 01:38:08.136]  He said he can't quite get his hand behind his back, which is what they ordered him to do, and he said he was trying to tell them, I can't do it, I can't do it.
[01:38:08.476 --> 01:38:09.577]  We saw this at the G20.
[01:38:09.577 --> 01:38:12.419]  They said nowhere in the city are you allowed to be out.
[01:38:35.552 --> 01:38:37.612]  And so they would ride down neighborhood streets.
[01:38:37.612 --> 01:38:39.813]  We have video that we shot of this.
[01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:49.115]  They would pull up to a nine-year-old with a baseball and a football, you know, kids playing, and aim sound cannons at them and broadcast.
[01:38:49.115 --> 01:38:50.715]  No one's allowed on the streets.
[01:38:50.715 --> 01:38:54.676]  They would go to the university when the college kids were out at night.
[01:38:54.676 --> 01:38:56.936]  Wasn't even demonstrations and attack them.
[01:38:56.936 --> 01:38:59.357]  There's video of police dogs.
[01:38:59.357 --> 01:39:01.057]  And I keep repeating this because I can't get over it.
[01:39:02.389 --> 01:39:08.572]  Like 65, 70-year-old women come out of stores with bags, and they're being real nice.
[01:39:08.572 --> 01:39:13.195]  And there's officers in stormtrooper outfits, and they say, sir, we're just shopping.
[01:39:13.195 --> 01:39:14.195]  He's like, get out of here!
[01:39:14.195 --> 01:39:17.997]  And the police dog's biting them, and they're billy clubbing people.
[01:39:17.997 --> 01:39:21.059]  So they love these rules.
[01:39:22.062 --> 01:39:35.921]  Where if you don't immediately jump or stand on one leg, even if you only have one leg, or if you don't get out of a wheelchair, there's all these famous footage where they arrest people in wheelchairs, they're at the police department, the jail, they say, get up!
[01:39:35.921 --> 01:39:39.645]  And the person goes, in one video, I'm a quadriplegic!
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:46.565]  And they laugh at him and just throw him out and his bones break because they're like rubber from not walking.
[01:39:46.565 --> 01:39:50.389]  And they just laugh at the guy there, you know, with his broken bones.
[01:39:50.389 --> 01:39:52.150]  And there's several of these videos.
[01:39:52.150 --> 01:40:02.940]  And so this guy is literally, looks like from what I've read and seen, but you know more of this than I, that they're wanting to see if he's drunk or something because he's 81 a little bit out of it.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.902]  And I guess they were saying stand on one leg.
[01:40:06.758 --> 01:40:10.540]  He doesn't submit, so they show him who's boss.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:13.902]  Hey, buddy, you're not allowed to be a little over the hill.
[01:40:13.902 --> 01:40:18.005]  You didn't understand what we said, boy.
[01:40:18.005 --> 01:40:20.266]  Because we've talked to him, too, on the phone.
[01:40:20.266 --> 01:40:25.690]  That's basically what we got is they were giving him orders of things to do out there in the dark and the cold.
[01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:34.713]  He was just like an old blind dog or something that, you know, an old blind dog in the ditch and it doesn't jump when you say, so you torture it.
[01:40:34.713 --> 01:40:42.196]  I mean, this is... Do we have to watch the military like attack dogs tearing the throat out of a rabbit here?
[01:40:42.196 --> 01:40:46.657]  What is this?
[01:40:46.657 --> 01:40:50.659]  You know, I'm not sure I can really answer that for you, Alex.
[01:40:51.789 --> 01:40:53.790]  I guess we just gotta watch old people everywhere.
[01:40:53.790 --> 01:41:06.975]  I mean, I see reports every day of 92-year-olds who are blind and half-deaf getting tasered and beat up because they don't mind the cops, or autistic children every day getting beat up or shot.
[01:41:06.975 --> 01:41:13.858]  I mean, retarded... I mean, can't police tell when they pull up to an elderly, senile person or a retarded child not to fill them full of lead?
[01:41:18.717 --> 01:41:22.966]  Well, I'm getting a little angry here and I appreciate the reporter coming on with us.
[01:41:22.966 --> 01:41:24.188]  Where is this going?
[01:41:24.188 --> 01:41:25.671]  Are they charging him with something?
[01:41:25.671 --> 01:41:28.236]  Are we going to put this dangerous terrorist in jail?
[01:41:29.596 --> 01:41:39.403]  He was originally going to be charged with fourth degree assault, resisting arrest, failure to stop at the direction of a peace officer, which is a felony.
[01:41:39.403 --> 01:41:45.107]  They did drop the assault charge, but the other two are sticking.
[01:41:45.107 --> 01:41:46.848]  He said he's got an attorney.
[01:41:46.848 --> 01:41:49.370]  He's going to fight it.
[01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:50.471]  We'll see where it ends up.
[01:41:51.527 --> 01:41:52.708]  Well that's the incredible part.
[01:41:52.708 --> 01:42:04.855]  I can't tell you how many videos have surfaced on YouTube or that we've shot where the police beat people up, no one resists them, and like an added insult, it's not enough I knocked your teeth out and hurt your kidneys.
[01:42:04.855 --> 01:42:06.916]  I'm going to charge you with assaulting me.
[01:42:06.916 --> 01:42:15.181]  But I guess they had a little pang of conscience about sending an 80 plus year old man down the river and so they are dropping the assault charge against him.
[01:42:15.181 --> 01:42:17.062]  I guess because the squad car video doesn't show that?
[01:42:18.422 --> 01:42:22.344]  I'm not sure exactly why, but they did drop it.
[01:42:22.344 --> 01:42:30.888]  Well, sir, are you doing any further investigation into why they're now declaring that the state highway is now their jurisdiction?
[01:42:30.888 --> 01:42:36.171]  You know, that's something that I've tried to look into a little bit.
[01:42:36.171 --> 01:42:40.453]  They claimed it's an exception under the state constitution.
[01:42:40.453 --> 01:42:43.915]  We're working on a follow-up on that right now.
[01:42:44.992 --> 01:43:02.421]  So now I guess you're saying they're claiming an exception to the state constitution that, oh, it's against the constitution, but we have an exception under Homeland Security, and so I guess this week it's the roads around the base, next week it's going to be the whole state and maybe the army in your bedroom at night.
[01:43:02.421 --> 01:43:14.527]  Well, as of right now, they're claiming that under the state constitution, under military roads, they have concurrent jurisdiction with the local authorities, and then at the same time they're also saying that
[01:43:15.673 --> 01:43:24.956]  This part of the Richardson State Highway, which you don't have to go through any kind of checkpoint for, they're saying that that's part of the base, and they have the right to patrol that.
[01:43:24.956 --> 01:43:29.557]  Are they... Is the base generating fines?
[01:43:29.557 --> 01:43:32.358]  Revenue off the citizens?
[01:43:32.358 --> 01:43:41.520]  Actually, this was charged by the Fairbanks District Attorney, so any revenue would go to the state, rather than the Air Force.
[01:43:42.148 --> 01:43:42.929]  Man, that's amazing.
[01:43:42.929 --> 01:43:44.630]  Well, I don't want to just sit here and talk at you.
[01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:49.775]  I know you're a journalist and a reporter, Chris, but you've obviously met with this older gentleman.
[01:43:49.775 --> 01:43:50.976]  We've just talked to him.
[01:43:50.976 --> 01:43:54.720]  You're saying he has bruises all over him.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.122]  I mean, he's not a criminal from what we've seen.
[01:43:57.122 --> 01:43:59.244]  He doesn't have a criminal record.
[01:43:59.244 --> 01:44:01.186]  He's had triple bypasses.
[01:44:01.186 --> 01:44:01.887]  I mean, I guess...
[01:44:03.615 --> 01:44:08.179]  I mean, does this irritate you, or are any of the locals upset about this?
[01:44:08.179 --> 01:44:12.223]  You know, I see a lot of the crime up here.
[01:44:12.223 --> 01:44:15.806]  That's my job, and there's a lot of weird things that happen.
[01:44:15.806 --> 01:44:24.374]  When I first saw this at the courthouse, I was shocked that someone of this age could really be tasered for any reason.
[01:44:24.374 --> 01:44:26.236]  You know, I wonder what kind of
[01:44:26.656 --> 01:44:34.922]  Threat an 81-year-old could pose to any kind of law enforcement, especially if there were four enlisted airmen in the 20s there.
[01:44:34.922 --> 01:44:41.026]  And I know that's been the general feeling here is, you know, why did they need to do this?
[01:44:41.026 --> 01:44:47.950]  Why did four young, presumably in shape, airmen have to taser an 81-year-old man?
[01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:56.436]  And there's been a lot of people, too, bringing up posse comitatus and wondering, you know, hey, why is the Air Force allowed to patrol that area of the state highway?
[01:44:56.977 --> 01:45:01.502]  Well, I'm going to be honest with everybody, just because it's important for this man's defense.
[01:45:01.502 --> 01:45:13.615]  We've talked to him, to Glenn M. Wilcox, this 81-year-old gentleman, and I believe he's a veteran too, isn't he?
[01:45:13.615 --> 01:45:15.357]  He was with the Civil Air Patrol.
[01:45:15.834 --> 01:45:16.795]  Yeah.
[01:45:16.795 --> 01:45:19.237]  Well, the issue here is this guy has no criminal record.
[01:45:19.237 --> 01:45:20.779]  He's a patriot.
[01:45:20.779 --> 01:45:21.499]  We've talked to him.
[01:45:21.499 --> 01:45:22.981]  I'm just going to be honest.
[01:45:22.981 --> 01:45:24.542]  Now, maybe we've caught him at bad times.
[01:45:24.542 --> 01:45:26.544]  We've talked to him several times.
[01:45:26.544 --> 01:45:33.470]  But I don't know how police, when they walk up to a senile old man, and we've talked to him, I mean, it's really sad.
[01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:36.393]  I don't know how they don't have anything but compassion for him.
[01:45:36.393 --> 01:45:39.136]  Instead, they beat him up and taser him.
[01:45:40.419 --> 01:45:54.725]  And it's just, it's so predatory and so anti-human and really, more than outraging, I just have nothing but disgust for these cowards that did this.
[01:45:54.725 --> 01:45:56.146]  And they think it's normal.
[01:45:56.146 --> 01:45:59.407]  They're so mentally ill, they think, he did not follow orders.
[01:45:59.407 --> 01:46:03.329]  He did not stand on one foot.
[01:46:03.329 --> 01:46:05.050]  You have voltage sent through you.
[01:46:05.050 --> 01:46:06.150]  I am robot.
[01:46:10.219 --> 01:46:12.880]  Well, I'm glad to hear locals are upset about this.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.302]  I mean, am I right in saying what you've told me is that locals are concerned?
[01:46:17.302 --> 01:46:20.364]  They're very upset from the comments.
[01:46:20.364 --> 01:46:25.286]  I came into work the next day and I had, you know, several calls on my voice band.
[01:46:25.286 --> 01:46:29.808]  I've gotten several, you know, since then, saying, you know, how did this happen?
[01:46:29.808 --> 01:46:32.350]  Yeah, people are very upset.
[01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:35.151]  Well, you've talked to him.
[01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:38.032]  The two times we've talked to him, he's like in and out.
[01:46:38.032 --> 01:46:39.133]  It sounds like
[01:46:40.345 --> 01:46:44.586]  Everybody knows, folks, sounds like something like Alzheimer's to me.
[01:46:44.586 --> 01:46:51.228]  You've talked to him, and I know you don't want to make a medical determination here, but does he not seem like he's not all there?
[01:46:51.228 --> 01:46:55.669]  You know, I can't really go into that.
[01:46:55.669 --> 01:47:06.612]  I just talked to him for a few minutes about what happened, and he seemed to have known what had happened to him, and he seemed very angry about it.
[01:47:07.847 --> 01:47:16.010]  Okay, maybe the times we've talked to him we woke him up or something, but you're saying he can't remember exactly what they were telling him to do.
[01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:28.134]  Well, no, he said that they were trying to tell him to put his hands behind his back, and he kept saying, you know, no, I'm old, I have these conditions, I can't put my hands behind my back, and that's when he ended up on the ground and ended up getting gazered.
[01:47:31.129 --> 01:47:34.770]  Yeah, we got that and they were asking him other things too over the phone.
[01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:39.452]  Maybe we should just try him again, guys, and try to get him.
[01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:50.275]  Maybe we caught him at bad times and he's been beat up and tasered and in three bypass surgeries, so maybe we just caught him when we called him when he was taking a nap the two times.
[01:47:50.275 --> 01:47:56.897]  Because if he is normally like the way he was when we talked to him, then the police are really out of control.
[01:47:58.037 --> 01:47:59.659]  And this is scary.
[01:47:59.659 --> 01:48:00.920]  So where is this going?
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.783]  So he still has charges against him and they're not going to rest until he's in jail, I guess?
[01:48:05.783 --> 01:48:11.048]  The charges are still pending and that's going to wind its way through the court system.
[01:48:11.048 --> 01:48:15.471]  What's wrong with the district attorney in your town?
[01:48:15.471 --> 01:48:21.236]  You know, that's something that you would have to ask him.
[01:48:21.236 --> 01:48:22.957]  What is his name?
[01:48:22.957 --> 01:48:23.938]  His name is Michael Gray.
[01:48:25.765 --> 01:48:27.326]  Michael Gray's a big man, I guess.
[01:48:27.326 --> 01:48:28.746]  He's really proud of himself.
[01:48:28.746 --> 01:48:31.388]  As if his 81-year-old done nothing to anybody.
[01:48:31.388 --> 01:48:33.969]  Has already been beat up, tasered, slammed on the ground.
[01:48:33.969 --> 01:48:34.849]  You said you saw him.
[01:48:34.849 --> 01:48:37.231]  I mean, how bad are the bruises?
[01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:41.913]  Um, actually, I talked to him on the phone, so I... Okay, he told you about bruises, then?
[01:48:41.913 --> 01:48:45.174]  Yeah, he told me he did have bruises all over his arms.
[01:48:45.174 --> 01:48:47.856]  Well, somebody needs to get over there and take photographs of this, because...
[01:48:49.997 --> 01:48:54.860]  And if he doesn't put on a good defense, they'll send him to prison, one more body in the private system.
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:57.422]  Okay, well listen, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:48:57.422 --> 01:49:03.366]  Have you just done the one report, 81-year-old tasered by Air Force Base Police?
[01:49:03.366 --> 01:49:06.248]  So far, yeah, that's the only story I've done on this, yes.
[01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:09.831]  And I guess you pronounce it Eilson or Eelison?
[01:49:09.831 --> 01:49:12.333]  Eilson, Air Force Base.
[01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:19.638]  Alright, well, thank you so much for covering this, and we really appreciate you coming on, Mr. Fryberg.
[01:49:20.154 --> 01:49:21.835]  Oh, thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:49:21.835 --> 01:49:22.095]  You bet.
[01:49:22.095 --> 01:49:23.376]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:23.376 --> 01:49:26.698]  The website is newsminer.com.
[01:49:26.698 --> 01:49:32.542]  It's an old mining town.
[01:49:32.542 --> 01:49:34.364]  Oh, it's one of the major cities.
[01:49:34.364 --> 01:49:37.105]  Fairbanks, Alaska, up there.
[01:49:37.105 --> 01:49:41.989]  You know, I don't want to bash the police, but I just can't handle the videos of them beating people up in wheelchairs.
[01:49:41.989 --> 01:49:42.609]  Get up!
[01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:45.131]  I said, get up!
[01:49:45.131 --> 01:49:47.993]  A pool of... No, you're not!
[01:49:47.993 --> 01:49:48.293]  Get up!
[01:49:50.956 --> 01:49:56.941]  And I mean, I even know a fellow in Austin who's paralyzed from the chest down that the Austin police beat up.
[01:49:56.941 --> 01:49:58.622]  They pull him over and they go, what are these?
[01:49:58.622 --> 01:50:00.944]  Are those weapons?
[01:50:00.944 --> 01:50:03.487]  No, these are my hand controls.
[01:50:03.487 --> 01:50:07.270]  Get out of the car!
[01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:12.794]  Okay, my wife's gotta go to the back, because this isn't my regular car that's set up for me to get out by myself.
[01:50:12.794 --> 01:50:14.976]  She has to get my wheelchair out.
[01:50:14.976 --> 01:50:15.997]  I said, get out!
[01:50:15.997 --> 01:50:18.019]  There's nothing wrong with you!
[01:50:20.009 --> 01:50:25.933]  This guy's got little shriveled up legs the size of a five-year-old's legs.
[01:50:25.933 --> 01:50:28.514]  He's paralyzed.
[01:50:28.514 --> 01:50:33.237]  They drag him out, beat him up, and laugh at him.
[01:50:33.237 --> 01:50:36.159]  Laugh at him crapping and peeing on himself on the ground.
[01:50:36.159 --> 01:50:39.061]  That's America, okay?
[01:50:39.061 --> 01:50:43.383]  That's people I know.
[01:50:43.383 --> 01:50:48.747]  That's somebody clean-cut, who's white, with his wife,
[01:50:49.875 --> 01:50:50.836]  Who's paralyzed?
[01:50:50.836 --> 01:50:53.278]  Can you imagine what they do to other people?
[01:50:53.278 --> 01:50:55.399]  What is wrong with you people?
[01:50:55.399 --> 01:50:57.421]  By the way, that cop got promoted.
[01:50:57.421 --> 01:51:01.024]  He's now a supervisor.
[01:51:01.024 --> 01:51:02.345]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.345 --> 01:51:07.929]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.929 --> 01:51:12.953]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.953 --> 01:51:13.433]  It's true.
[01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:16.235]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:16.235 --> 01:51:17.977]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.497 --> 01:51:23.742]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.742 --> 01:51:30.849]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.849 --> 01:51:31.970]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:38.296]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.656 --> 01:51:39.217]  We're good to go.
[01:52:00.891 --> 01:52:03.513]  Worried that inflation will destroy your savings?
[01:52:03.513 --> 01:52:04.675]  Grab a pencil.
[01:52:04.675 --> 01:52:13.703]  I'll tell you how to turn $10,000 into potentially $431,000 in 12 to 18 months, thanks to Obama.
[01:52:13.703 --> 01:52:16.245]  And this isn't about gold bullion or coins.
[01:52:16.245 --> 01:52:17.987]  It's about gold stocks.
[01:52:17.987 --> 01:52:19.448]  They have soared over 800% since the year 2000.
[01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:30.613]  This is with gold being less than $1,000, a figure that should go to between $1,500 and $2,500 according to Merrill Lynch and UBS.
[01:52:30.613 --> 01:52:41.817]  Even better, wait till you hear what Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter says in his free Investing in Gold kit.
[01:52:41.817 --> 01:52:47.519]  It highlights seven must-own stocks, including a stock with six-figure potential whose price has
[01:52:47.779 --> 01:52:48.540]  We're good to go.
[01:53:17.043 --> 01:53:21.806]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:53:21.806 --> 01:53:25.729]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:39.718]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles, chlorine reducing shower filters, air purifiers, water ionizers, filters that remove up to 95% of the fluoride in your water, whole house water purification systems,
[01:53:39.958 --> 01:53:40.358]  I think so.
[01:54:08.317 --> 01:54:11.580]  The police have been taught to be ruthless and vicious to the public.
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:24.812]  Now a lot of our police are fine men and women and do protect and serve, but more and more it's encouraged to be a bunch of ruthless thugs, and I can't watch people in wheelchairs getting beat up.
[01:54:24.812 --> 01:54:27.194]  You haven't seen the videos online?
[01:54:27.194 --> 01:54:28.535]  Just search it.
[01:54:28.535 --> 01:54:30.037]  Police beat up man in wheelchair.
[01:54:30.037 --> 01:54:31.338]  Police dump man in a wheelchair.
[01:54:33.806 --> 01:54:35.847]  And you have no defense for what you do.
[01:54:35.847 --> 01:54:37.808]  You've dehumanized us.
[01:54:37.808 --> 01:54:39.128]  You've been dehumanized.
[01:54:39.128 --> 01:54:41.409]  You're being hurt by the very same system.
[01:54:41.409 --> 01:54:43.810]  Just wake up and repent.
[01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:45.591]  Tell yourself it's wrong what you've done.
[01:54:45.591 --> 01:54:48.192]  None of us are perfect, but come on.
[01:54:48.192 --> 01:54:54.775]  Just as a man, it's a fundamental level watching weak people getting picked on makes me hate your guts.
[01:54:54.775 --> 01:54:59.497]  And I try to control that and try to not blame all police for that.
[01:54:59.497 --> 01:55:02.678]  But look, I don't see these cops getting in trouble.
[01:55:04.192 --> 01:55:08.153]  You want to run these people out of your departments, but no, they're encouraged.
[01:55:08.153 --> 01:55:10.174]  Bob Chapman's coming up at the 8 after in the next hour.
[01:55:10.174 --> 01:55:15.816]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, but I'm going to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:55:15.816 --> 01:55:18.617]  Report at least two dead, eight injured in Orlando shooting.
[01:55:18.617 --> 01:55:27.860]  Authorities have identified the alleged gunman as Jason Rodriguez, 40, a former employee of the office building, so it's a spoiled brat throwing a fit.
[01:55:30.765 --> 01:55:32.167]  Rodriguez remains at large.
[01:55:32.167 --> 01:55:33.588]  He is considered armed and dangerous.
[01:55:33.588 --> 01:55:40.997]  He's believed to be driving a 2002 silver Nissan SUV with Florida license plate D119UX.
[01:55:40.997 --> 01:55:42.839]  Police have not confirmed the number of victims.
[01:55:42.839 --> 01:55:46.483]  They said five patients were transported to the local hospital.
[01:55:46.483 --> 01:55:48.745]  Police do not know what Rodriguez's motives was.
[01:55:50.546 --> 01:55:54.749]  It goes on, police are in the process of thoroughly searching the perimeter of the office building.
[01:55:54.749 --> 01:55:57.892]  They could not confirm that the building had been completely searched.
[01:55:57.892 --> 01:56:01.815]  Police ask community members to keep their eyes open for the suspect.
[01:56:01.815 --> 01:56:03.016]  And it goes on from there.
[01:56:03.016 --> 01:56:08.440]  So a copycat shooter, probably on Prozac or one of those drugs.
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.262]  When aren't they on them?
[01:56:10.262 --> 01:56:16.447]  Because it gets rid of your psychological barriers to doing this type of stuff.
[01:56:19.369 --> 01:56:21.911]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nikki in Oregon.
[01:56:21.911 --> 01:56:22.571]  Nikki, welcome.
[01:56:22.571 --> 01:56:24.992]  She just dropped, okay?
[01:56:24.992 --> 01:56:26.173]  Kevin in Mass.
[01:56:26.173 --> 01:56:28.034]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:56:28.034 --> 01:56:29.315]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:34.898]  People are always asking you, with the outrage of the New World Order increasing daily, what can we do?
[01:56:34.898 --> 01:56:44.824]  And we've been waking people up, but I have a proposal, an action proposal I think would capitalize on our growing numbers thanks to your great films and people spreading them.
[01:56:44.824 --> 01:56:48.046]  It's peaceful, it's a way to strike back, and it's a smart
[01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:49.230]  Effective way.
[01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:53.391]  It's specific, measurable, attainable, reliable, timely, and tangible.
[01:56:53.391 --> 01:56:55.171]  This guy definitely looked like a patsy.
[01:56:55.171 --> 01:57:02.953]  They wouldn't have promoted him with all this, you know, radical comments on the internet and everything.
[01:57:02.953 --> 01:57:07.334]  With the economy struggling, people can't go on a strike.
[01:57:07.334 --> 01:57:11.595]  You know, in France, they went on a strike when the government was getting out of hand.
[01:57:11.595 --> 01:57:13.435]  Our unions seem to be out of control.
[01:57:13.435 --> 01:57:18.196]  They're not representing the workers, and there's been no strikes, and people are laying down for the growing globalism.
[01:57:18.897 --> 01:57:19.518]  I'm good.
[01:57:39.785 --> 01:57:47.757]  What we can do is really start a campaign, you know, to just turn our televisions off like that old clip from Network, you know.
[01:57:47.757 --> 01:57:49.539]  Just turn it off!
[01:57:49.539 --> 01:57:50.420]  Turn it off!
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:52.103]  Turn it off!
[01:57:52.103 --> 01:57:52.644]  Absolutely.
[01:57:52.644 --> 01:57:54.146]  This will hurt them in their pocketbook.
[01:57:55.235 --> 01:57:58.737]  It's a voluntary, you know, I live at home with my wife and my two kids.
[01:57:58.737 --> 01:58:00.659]  How am I going to enforce this on them?
[01:58:00.659 --> 01:58:01.019]  No.
[01:58:01.019 --> 01:58:02.661]  But I'm going to set an example.
[01:58:02.661 --> 01:58:06.023]  And if we all set an example, this is something that can take off.
[01:58:06.023 --> 01:58:08.105]  We've got the numbers right now.
[01:58:08.105 --> 01:58:09.646]  We're shutting down the newspapers.
[01:58:09.646 --> 01:58:11.187]  We can shut down the television.
[01:58:11.187 --> 01:58:12.168]  It's an info war.
[01:58:12.168 --> 01:58:13.129]  We're winning it.
[01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:14.650]  Let's take it to the next level.
[01:58:14.650 --> 01:58:16.031]  Let's make it a campaign.
[01:58:16.031 --> 01:58:18.914]  Let's get Peter Schiff, Ron Paul, the Oath Keepers.
[01:58:18.914 --> 01:58:20.455]  You know, let's join Oath Keepers.
[01:58:20.455 --> 01:58:22.857]  You know, if you're pleased with the military especially, but it's open to everybody.
[01:58:23.294 --> 01:58:23.814]  I hear you.
[01:58:23.814 --> 01:58:26.255]  We gotta go to break.
[01:58:26.255 --> 01:58:30.876]  We should just start with people turning the television off, say, three days a week.
[01:58:30.876 --> 01:58:32.517]  See if you can just do that.
[01:58:32.517 --> 01:58:34.698]  Actually spend time with your family.
[01:58:34.698 --> 01:58:36.838]  Big article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:36.838 --> 01:58:42.800]  We'll tell you about it when we come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.401]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:48.542]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.509 --> 01:58:59.654]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.654 --> 01:59:03.016]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:03.016 --> 01:59:08.899]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:08.899 --> 01:59:13.662]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.662 --> 01:59:16.023]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:59:16.203 --> 01:59:16.623]  Thank you.
[01:59:35.114 --> 01:59:38.836]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:59:38.836 --> 01:59:41.037]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.

[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:49.721]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:59:49.721 --> 01:59:53.603]  Do it now.
[01:59:53.603 --> 01:59:55.984]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.984 --> 01:59:58.746]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.393 --> 02:00:10.215]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.215 --> 02:00:11.796]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.796 --> 02:00:13.357]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.357 --> 02:00:17.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.559 --> 02:00:21.601]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.697 --> 02:00:28.639]  We've now reached the halfway point in this worldwide broadcast.
[02:00:28.639 --> 02:00:38.564]  Key article up at PrisonPlanet.com right now that needs to be emailed out to everyone you know so we can force the media to start addressing this.
[02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:43.087]  Was Fort Hood killer on psychotropic drugs?
[02:00:43.087 --> 02:00:52.913]  Despite clear link between antidepressants and mass shooting, media fails to ask if Hassan was on SSRIs.
[02:00:52.913 --> 02:00:54.714]  By Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:00:58.649 --> 02:01:02.552]  Nidal Malik Hassan was a psychiatrist.
[02:01:02.552 --> 02:01:05.293]  He'd had psychological trouble, the reports are saying.
[02:01:05.293 --> 02:01:06.994]  You can bet he was on them.
[02:01:06.994 --> 02:01:10.337]  When are the mass shooters not on them?
[02:01:10.337 --> 02:01:12.158]  Very, very suspicious.
[02:01:12.158 --> 02:01:14.059]  This needs to come out now.
[02:01:14.059 --> 02:01:16.701]  His medical record needs to be released now.
[02:01:16.701 --> 02:01:23.005]  You better believe if the establishment liked what was in that record, it would be public.
[02:01:23.005 --> 02:01:27.968]  The media needs to start asking these questions.
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:33.182]  Key article up at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:01:33.182 --> 02:01:35.063]  Bob Chapman's coming up on the economy.
[02:01:35.063 --> 02:01:38.164]  We'll also open the phones up with Bob throughout the hour.
[02:01:38.164 --> 02:01:44.307]  And we have an award-winning writer joining us to talk about Goldman Sachs betting against the housing market.
[02:01:44.307 --> 02:01:50.450]  This could potentially be very, very serious for that company and bring them to justice.
[02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:52.951]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:01:54.571 --> 02:01:59.014]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Ohio.
[02:01:59.014 --> 02:01:59.654]  You're on the air.
[02:01:59.654 --> 02:02:02.256]  Hi Alex.
[02:02:02.256 --> 02:02:04.358]  I loved your movie that you just made.
[02:02:04.358 --> 02:02:05.578]  Thank you.
[02:02:05.578 --> 02:02:07.200]  Follow the Republic.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.803]  And I just got something to say about the shooting yesterday with Hassan.
[02:02:12.803 --> 02:02:14.665]  This guy's a military guy.
[02:02:14.665 --> 02:02:16.005]  He's a major.
[02:02:16.005 --> 02:02:17.767]  He's a doctor.
[02:02:17.767 --> 02:02:22.470]  And the only photo that they have of him is some black and white photo where he looks like some psycho.
[02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:26.422]  That just seems kind of weird, doesn't it?
[02:02:26.422 --> 02:02:29.844]  And then they conveniently have him in his Muslim garb.
[02:02:29.844 --> 02:02:33.426]  Look, the whole thing, if you go over it, stinks to high heaven.
[02:02:33.426 --> 02:02:36.168]  He's making these anti-war statements.
[02:02:36.168 --> 02:02:40.311]  He's making these statements, reportedly, against the political system.
[02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:46.014]  I mean, if a private does that, they drum them out of the military in ten seconds.
[02:02:46.014 --> 02:02:50.077]  But he reportedly said all this, and they said, no, you're going to Iraq.
[02:02:50.917 --> 02:02:58.143]  And then they lied and said he was dead for six hours, and then people are reporting other shooters, and then he's a psychiatrist.
[02:02:58.143 --> 02:03:03.667]  I mean, this thing's got mind control or Patsy written all over it.
[02:03:03.667 --> 02:03:14.616]  I just, I was looking at all the different news sites, CNN, Fox, everyone, and the only photo they have is some black and white photo of this guy, a couple photos, and then that video.
[02:03:14.616 --> 02:03:16.037]  And, I mean, if it's a major,
[02:03:16.621 --> 02:03:22.305]  You would expect him to, you know, have at least one photo where he's decorated in uniform or something.
[02:03:22.305 --> 02:03:25.787]  And they got some weird photo out there, which just, it just seems weird.
[02:03:25.787 --> 02:03:27.988]  That's all.
[02:03:27.988 --> 02:03:29.349]  Well, it's a mess.
[02:03:29.349 --> 02:03:30.870]  It is certainly a mess.
[02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:43.478]  And the globalists love divide and conquer, and we're a nation of all these different groups and religions and people, and in the name of multiculturalism, they actually remind us of our differences and hype it up to create more division.
[02:03:44.394 --> 02:03:46.195]  It's the perfect cover story.
[02:03:46.195 --> 02:03:54.018]  There's the establishment saying, oh, the tea parties yesterday, they were out protesting the health care bill because they're racist.
[02:03:54.018 --> 02:03:57.960]  That's racist to inject the term racism into it.
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:00.801]  That is divide and conquer.
[02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:06.083]  We have time later, I'll play these clips of Matthews and Oberman, just disgusting.
[02:04:06.083 --> 02:04:08.084]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:04:09.207 --> 02:04:16.493]  And now with the Afghan war faltering and the citizens not wanting the war and all this news coming out, this conveniently happens.
[02:04:16.493 --> 02:04:22.998]  But I mean, he could be a crazy person who was a Muslim wacko.
[02:04:22.998 --> 02:04:24.339]  You got wackos from all groups.
[02:04:26.246 --> 02:04:28.166]  He could just be mentally ill.
[02:04:28.166 --> 02:04:33.688]  Psychiatrists have the highest statistics, as I've said, of being mentally ill and on drugs.
[02:04:33.688 --> 02:04:35.748]  Or he could be mind controlled.
[02:04:35.748 --> 02:04:36.828]  Mind control exists.
[02:04:36.828 --> 02:04:37.788]  That is real.
[02:04:37.788 --> 02:04:40.229]  I talked about it last hour.
[02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:41.449]  Or hour before last.
[02:04:41.449 --> 02:04:43.570]  And we'll continue to take your phone calls.
[02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:45.570]  Nick, Jeff, Randy, Arnold, many others.
[02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:46.210]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:46.210 --> 02:04:46.530]  It's Friday.
[02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:47.671]  The 6th day of November.
[02:04:56.225 --> 02:04:59.187]  2009, Bob Chapman with his weekly report on the economy.
[02:04:59.187 --> 02:05:00.527]  Straight ahead.
[02:05:00.527 --> 02:05:03.928]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.928 --> 02:05:07.550]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.550 --> 02:05:12.131]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.131 --> 02:05:13.532]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:16.674]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.674 --> 02:05:22.777]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.777 --> 02:05:26.400]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:31.223]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.223 --> 02:05:37.787]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.787 --> 02:05:39.708]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.208 --> 02:05:43.411]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.411 --> 02:05:47.915]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.915 --> 02:05:50.137]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.137 --> 02:05:50.437]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.437 --> 02:05:51.138]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.206 --> 02:06:04.230]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:09.557]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.557 --> 02:06:11.620]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:16.186]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.186 --> 02:06:16.666]  We're good to go.
[02:06:39.597 --> 02:06:40.818]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.818 --> 02:06:41.719]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.719 --> 02:06:42.820]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:43.760]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:44.861]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.861 --> 02:06:47.904]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.904 --> 02:06:49.685]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.685 --> 02:06:50.606]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.242 --> 02:07:05.549]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:10.075]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.075 --> 02:07:12.358]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:13.980]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:15.002]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.222 --> 02:07:23.664]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.664 --> 02:07:31.106]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.106 --> 02:07:36.768]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.148 --> 02:07:43.174]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:43.174 --> 02:07:47.319]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:47.319 --> 02:07:54.786]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:07:54.786 --> 02:07:58.090]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:00.942 --> 02:08:06.324]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.324 --> 02:08:08.646]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:08.646 --> 02:08:28.995]  We got about nine days to produce your video using 20 minutes with the President written by Charlie Sheen and to get it turned into us by midnight Sunday the 15th of November.
[02:08:30.148 --> 02:08:36.472]  We've gotten, I haven't counted them up, I've watched them all, 50, 60, I know it's more than 50 entries.
[02:08:36.472 --> 02:08:37.413]  Some are really good.
[02:08:37.413 --> 02:08:42.576]  A lot of them, almost no work was put into it.
[02:08:42.576 --> 02:08:50.841]  You know, we did the contest with posting the Obama Joker posters, and it made the news worldwide.
[02:08:50.841 --> 02:08:52.462]  Hundreds of TV stations, hundreds.
[02:08:52.462 --> 02:08:58.346]  I mean, it was scores of TV stations in Texas alone, with the media freaking out every time a poster was put up.
[02:08:59.582 --> 02:09:05.786]  Saying it was evil and un-American and then that would blow up in their face and even more would be posted.
[02:09:05.786 --> 02:09:07.827]  Wildly successful.
[02:09:07.827 --> 02:09:13.831]  And certainly, hundreds of thousands of people, total, have seen the videos that are posted.
[02:09:13.831 --> 02:09:18.274]  Some have 10,000 views, 5,000 views, 1,000 views, 8,000 views.
[02:09:18.274 --> 02:09:22.096]  And we've been posting the three or four entries a day as they come in.
[02:09:22.096 --> 02:09:26.298]  And I know the really good ones, and some of them are great, are gonna come in near the
[02:09:28.462 --> 02:09:35.348]  Turn in date, and then in the next week after that we'll announce when Charlie's coming on and we'll announce who's winning the $14,000.
[02:09:35.348 --> 02:09:41.754]  But I'll say this, everybody wins who enters the contest.
[02:09:41.754 --> 02:09:43.196]  And people are asking for direction.
[02:09:43.196 --> 02:09:44.777]  I'm getting calls and emails.
[02:09:44.777 --> 02:09:47.420]  I can't give you directions, okay?
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:50.542]  I can't give somebody direction of what I'd like to see and then
[02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:53.352]  Charlie's picking the winner.
[02:09:53.352 --> 02:10:02.680]  It's whatever strikes Charlie Sheen as the best produced, the best message, the best adaptation of that 15-page 20 Minutes with the President.
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.721]  And the key is the 20 points.
[02:10:04.721 --> 02:10:09.085]  Those are the most important 20 points of 9-11 truth that we've identified.
[02:10:10.026 --> 02:10:13.568]  This is a $14,000 prize, first place.
[02:10:13.568 --> 02:10:14.708]  Second place is $1,000.
[02:10:14.708 --> 02:10:16.309]  Third place is $500.
[02:10:16.309 --> 02:10:19.750]  Everybody wins by getting the truth out about 9-11 Truth.
[02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:24.412]  So in the last nine days, I would ask listeners, send 20minuteswiththepresident.com.
[02:10:24.412 --> 02:10:26.133]  There's a banner on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:26.133 --> 02:10:30.115]  If you go to InfoWars.com and click on the banner, it goes to 20 Minutes
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:33.021]  withthepresident.com.
[02:10:33.021 --> 02:10:33.921]  It's a really nice site.
[02:10:33.921 --> 02:10:36.362]  It has Charlie Sheen's message to the President there.
[02:10:36.362 --> 02:10:39.704]  It has the 20 Minutes with the President article there.
[02:10:39.704 --> 02:10:45.667]  And it could be two black guys talking, two white guys, a black guy and a white guy, a white guy and a black girl.
[02:10:45.667 --> 02:10:47.047]  It could be a Chinese person.
[02:10:47.047 --> 02:10:48.588]  It could be a Native American.
[02:10:48.588 --> 02:10:49.248]  It doesn't matter.
[02:10:49.248 --> 02:10:52.070]  It could be video clips with a voiceover.
[02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:57.132]  But we got nine days left on this, and you send them
[02:10:58.831 --> 02:11:01.433]  In fact, we have a special email just for the contest, don't we?
[02:11:01.433 --> 02:11:04.676]  It's linked up there on the site.
[02:11:04.676 --> 02:11:12.623]  And if you haven't seen us post your contest entry, because Lord knows we're missing them.
[02:11:13.519 --> 02:11:14.900]  Send them again.
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:16.821]  Send them to Kurt at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:17.801]  Send them to Aaron.
[02:11:17.801 --> 02:11:21.843]  CC it to Sheen at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:21.843 --> 02:11:23.583]  Contest at InfoWars.
[02:11:23.583 --> 02:11:26.365]  Our problem is we're having trouble with email management.
[02:11:26.365 --> 02:11:27.805]  We're putting in a new system.
[02:11:27.805 --> 02:11:29.746]  We get three, four, 5,000 emails a day.
[02:11:29.746 --> 02:11:32.407]  Most of them are spam, but over 1,000 are good emails.
[02:11:32.407 --> 02:11:40.551]  We battle to read them, to scan them, but it's kind of like, and it goes in its own box, but sometimes it gets, the point is make sure you get your entry into us as well.
[02:11:42.304 --> 02:11:43.244]  And so we can post them.
[02:11:43.244 --> 02:11:46.905]  But there's nine days left in this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:46.905 --> 02:11:48.786]  Nine.
[02:11:48.786 --> 02:11:53.487]  Nine days left until the close on November 15th.
[02:11:53.487 --> 02:11:58.529]  Then we've got to have time to review them, make sure we get them all, and then Charlie can judge them.
[02:11:58.529 --> 02:12:00.649]  I'm going to judge second and third place.
[02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:03.230]  But when we had the idea for the contest, I said, how about $10,000?
[02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:05.371]  He said, yeah, but taxes, it'll be $3,000, $4,000.
[02:12:07.116 --> 02:12:08.017]  Let's do $13,500.
[02:12:08.017 --> 02:12:12.921]  And I said, yeah, but $13,500 sounds weird.
[02:12:12.921 --> 02:12:14.042]  Let's do $14,000.
[02:12:14.042 --> 02:12:17.265]  $14,000 to whoever does the best job.
[02:12:17.265 --> 02:12:18.486]  And again, everybody wins.
[02:12:18.486 --> 02:12:20.368]  It gets the word out to everyone.
[02:12:20.368 --> 02:12:27.355]  And I like a lot of the entries that have come in, but we're not seeing 200, 300 entries like we saw on the Joker, Obama.
[02:12:29.637 --> 02:12:34.661]  Now, I know more coming in, but it's not too late for you to do this.
[02:12:34.661 --> 02:12:36.463]  It's not too late for you to get involved.
[02:12:36.463 --> 02:12:37.764]  I want to see your creativity.
[02:12:37.764 --> 02:12:38.665]  I want to see what you're going to do.
[02:12:40.973 --> 02:12:45.297]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to commend everybody out there that has been involved in it.
[02:12:45.297 --> 02:12:45.838]  Great work.
[02:12:45.838 --> 02:12:48.200]  A few of them aren't too great.
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.063]  Pretty half-hearted job on some of them.
[02:12:51.063 --> 02:12:53.686]  But that happened with the Obama poster contest as well.
[02:12:53.686 --> 02:12:58.991]  The point is, these videos will then drift around forever, pointing out the key 20 bullet points.
[02:12:58.991 --> 02:13:01.694]  But you can do it however you want, in whatever way you want.
[02:13:04.025 --> 02:13:06.406]  But get on it today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:06.406 --> 02:13:08.287]  20minuteswiththepresident.com.
[02:13:08.287 --> 02:13:11.349]  That's 20 with the President, or you can type it out.
[02:13:11.349 --> 02:13:14.450]  20minuteswiththepresident.com is a word.
[02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:19.233]  Spell out 20 minutes with the President or 20 with the President dot com.
[02:13:19.233 --> 02:13:22.314]  Both of those addresses get you there, don't they?
[02:13:22.314 --> 02:13:27.937]  Both those URLs, 20 with the President dot com and 20 spelled out with the President dot com.
[02:13:30.222 --> 02:13:30.522]  Oh, really?
[02:13:30.522 --> 02:13:32.323]  Because we wanted 2-0 with the President.
[02:13:32.323 --> 02:13:33.704]  That was the URL we bought.
[02:13:33.704 --> 02:13:39.528]  Can we get that linked up, too?
[02:13:39.528 --> 02:13:40.429]  Okay, okay.
[02:13:40.429 --> 02:13:41.789]  No, somebody else has that.
[02:13:41.789 --> 02:13:43.030]  All right.
[02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:44.411]  So you just spell it out.
[02:13:44.411 --> 02:13:46.733]  20MinutesWithThePresident.com.
[02:13:46.733 --> 02:13:49.895]  Okay, going to Bob Chapman.
[02:13:51.068 --> 02:14:02.022]  Former military intelligence ran the biggest financial newsletter out there for a long time, retired, came back with the internationalforecaster.com and a lot of just amazing predictions.
[02:14:02.022 --> 02:14:05.226]  He said many, many months ago,
[02:14:06.141 --> 02:14:10.603]  That the stock market would go back up, gold would explode.
[02:14:10.603 --> 02:14:11.884]  He predicted that in the fall.
[02:14:11.884 --> 02:14:14.665]  I don't want to go back over all his predictions here.
[02:14:14.665 --> 02:14:16.086]  We've done that before.
[02:14:16.086 --> 02:14:19.628]  We just need to pay attention to what he's saying now.
[02:14:19.628 --> 02:14:25.351]  And I want to start going to your phone calls for those that are holding at the bottom of the hour, specifically questions for
[02:14:27.301 --> 02:14:31.322]  Bob Chapman, but I know some of the callers are already holding, so you can bring up other issues.
[02:14:31.322 --> 02:14:45.546]  He'll be able to comment on that, but after we go through this raft of calls, if you're calling in, just questions for Bob Chapman on the economy and the balance of the hour that we have, 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on air.
[02:14:45.546 --> 02:14:48.126]  Bob Chapman, good to have you here with us.
[02:14:48.126 --> 02:14:48.787]  Well, thank you.
[02:14:48.787 --> 02:14:51.107]  It's good to be here again.
[02:14:51.107 --> 02:14:51.767]  Gold is above $1,102.
[02:14:55.595 --> 02:15:03.903]  Now somewhere up in that area, it's been trading back and forth over $1100, exactly as we predicted.
[02:15:03.903 --> 02:15:15.215]  And you know what's surprising about this, and it's very disappointing to me, analysts, economists, newsletter writers, they poll them.
[02:15:15.215 --> 02:15:17.517]  Hurlbut has a service where they poll them.
[02:15:18.306 --> 02:15:24.448]  And 96% of them said that gold was going to go back down again.
[02:15:24.448 --> 02:15:27.969]  I mean, you talk about a massive egg in your face.
[02:15:27.969 --> 02:15:31.309]  I don't know what these people are thinking about.
[02:15:31.309 --> 02:15:34.690]  They're not reading the tea leaves right.
[02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:36.851]  But anyway, we're happy we were right.
[02:15:36.851 --> 02:15:41.632]  Our subscribers, our listeners, they're making money and so that's what it's all about.
[02:15:41.632 --> 02:15:44.453]  But more than that, they're protecting themselves.
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:48.441]  But Bob, you've made this point many times.
[02:15:48.441 --> 02:15:50.942]  Most of those analysts aren't stupid.
[02:15:50.942 --> 02:15:57.464]  They're paid and put on national television and given syndicated columns to lie to people.
[02:15:57.464 --> 02:15:59.005]  Well, that's true.
[02:15:59.005 --> 02:16:02.946]  And then you have the factor of acceptability.
[02:16:02.946 --> 02:16:08.728]  A lot of these writers will know what's going on, but they won't talk about
[02:16:09.609 --> 02:16:11.611]  The very hard facts.
[02:16:11.611 --> 02:16:12.872]  They'll color them.
[02:16:12.872 --> 02:16:21.940]  They'll say, well, maybe the people at the SEC or the CFTC will pursue the fact that the market is being manipulated.
[02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:25.703]  It's just full of excuses.
[02:16:25.703 --> 02:16:33.249]  And that draws them into the middle, so to speak, so they're not thought ill of within their profession.
[02:16:33.249 --> 02:16:34.390]  I get a different viewpoint.
[02:16:34.390 --> 02:16:35.651]  I don't care what anybody thinks.
[02:16:36.909 --> 02:16:49.838]  I hope that I'm right and I say what I say and I've been pretty successful at it and I hope it continues that way but nothing stands in my way and I think less of them for that.
[02:16:49.838 --> 02:16:57.563]  Well you tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may and 95% of the time you're accurate, so am I, and that's why
[02:16:58.547 --> 02:17:01.968]  We're so successful at reaching people, but it's kind of sad.
[02:17:01.968 --> 02:17:06.789]  I mean, it's like telling somebody you're going to die of cancer, and now we're dying of cancer as a country.
[02:17:06.789 --> 02:17:08.389]  The Republic is in bad shape.
[02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:11.410]  If we don't remove these criminals immediately, it's over.
[02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:14.191]  But it may be even too far gone for that.
[02:17:14.191 --> 02:17:17.852]  We just need to remove them so it doesn't get a hundred times worse.
[02:17:17.852 --> 02:17:21.912]  Bob, what happened with the IMF dumping all this gold in the market?
[02:17:21.912 --> 02:17:23.373]  Ted Anderson, Ron Paul,
[02:17:24.153 --> 02:17:38.263]  In fact, I'm going to play that clip later of Ron Paul, said that clearly the IMF and World Bank came in and tried to drive down gold, and that for the first time in modern history, their attempt to drive it down failed and blew up in their face.
[02:17:38.263 --> 02:17:44.067]  And this is a major sea change for the dollar, for the markets, for gold.
[02:17:44.067 --> 02:17:46.889]  A, do you concur with Ron Paul and Ted Anderson?
[02:17:46.889 --> 02:17:50.451]  And B, what does this mean in the short term?
[02:17:50.451 --> 02:17:51.212]  I agree.
[02:17:51.212 --> 02:17:52.493]  It's a seminal moment.
[02:17:53.564 --> 02:17:55.284]  And we've just passed it.
[02:17:55.284 --> 02:17:59.866]  I said there would be an untoward event, and that was it.
[02:17:59.866 --> 02:18:11.909]  And the only question I have about that is that I suspect there's a possibility that the Indians didn't buy that gold.
[02:18:11.909 --> 02:18:17.830]  I think there's a possibility that that gold could have been sold some time ago.
[02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:21.111]  And what they were effectively doing was completing the transaction
[02:18:21.570 --> 02:18:23.211]  By covering a short position.
[02:18:23.211 --> 02:18:31.998]  In other words, they had sold and they would have had somebody ostensibly buy it back when in fact they weren't.
[02:18:31.998 --> 02:18:41.204]  Now, India was one of the signatories to the IMF in 1947.
[02:18:41.204 --> 02:18:44.807]  And they chose a number of countries to hold gold.
[02:18:44.807 --> 02:18:47.829]  And India was one of them.
[02:18:47.829 --> 02:18:50.511]  And perhaps it's possible
[02:18:51.351 --> 02:18:58.676]  That the gold that India held may have been sold previously.
[02:18:58.676 --> 02:19:02.198]  And India was just saying, well, we're buying it.
[02:19:02.198 --> 02:19:09.122]  And that would have completed the transactions because essentially they were sellers on behalf of the IMF before.
[02:19:09.122 --> 02:19:11.644]  So that's possible.
[02:19:11.644 --> 02:19:16.667]  The other thing is maybe they did, in fact, buy the gold.
[02:19:16.667 --> 02:19:19.528]  I don't know which, but I do know one thing.
[02:19:19.528 --> 02:19:20.389]  They're both good.
[02:19:21.392 --> 02:19:28.538]  And the Chinese say that we can get gold cheaper by buying gold produced in the country.
[02:19:28.538 --> 02:19:30.160]  And they're right.
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:36.565]  They're a big gold producer, but they have to wait for it to be harvested and brought in.
[02:19:36.565 --> 02:19:40.148]  And so I think Chinese are going to line up there.
[02:19:40.148 --> 02:19:44.592]  And if there is gold for sale in reality, I think they'll be
[02:19:45.962 --> 02:19:48.083]  Go ahead.
[02:19:48.083 --> 02:19:49.244]  Okay, stay there.
[02:19:49.244 --> 02:19:51.005]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:19:51.005 --> 02:19:56.307]  We're going to continue to talk about these joblessness numbers, record high, and that's even Cook numbers.
[02:19:56.307 --> 02:20:00.149]  We're going to talk about where gold's going from here and your phone calls.
[02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:04.112]  What's so crazy about not starving?
[02:20:04.112 --> 02:20:11.081]  To cover yourself and your family in the event of accidents or emergency you may have home, life, auto, dental and health insurance.
[02:20:11.081 --> 02:20:12.784]  But what about food insurance?
[02:20:12.784 --> 02:20:15.107]  Water and food are vital to human survival.
[02:20:15.107 --> 02:20:17.670]  So what's so crazy about not starving?
[02:20:17.850 --> 02:20:24.275]  Foodinsurance.com has designed emergency packs and kits with at least two weeks worth of great tasting food and clean water.

[02:21:00.748 --> 02:21:02.930]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:02.930 --> 02:21:03.790]  Spy on me?
[02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:04.110]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:09.154]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.154 --> 02:21:10.795]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:11.536]  Startpage?
[02:21:11.536 --> 02:21:11.956]  Yeah.
[02:21:11.956 --> 02:21:13.037]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.037 --> 02:21:16.019]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.019 --> 02:21:19.882]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:19.882 --> 02:21:22.684]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.024 --> 02:21:25.626]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:25.626 --> 02:21:27.227]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.227 --> 02:21:27.507]  Right!
[02:21:27.507 --> 02:21:30.829]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:21:30.829 --> 02:21:31.409]  Hello, folks.
[02:21:31.409 --> 02:21:32.770]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:21:32.770 --> 02:21:36.612]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:36.612 --> 02:21:40.415]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:50.703]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.

[02:22:01.232 --> 02:22:02.253]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.253 --> 02:22:07.777]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:07.777 --> 02:22:08.338]  I get it.
[02:22:08.338 --> 02:22:17.945]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:17.945 --> 02:22:19.106]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.366 --> 02:22:27.834]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:27.834 --> 02:22:31.237]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.237 --> 02:22:35.501]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:35.501 --> 02:22:37.103]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.103 --> 02:22:40.506]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.506 --> 02:22:44.670]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:45.751]  You should, too.
[02:22:45.751 --> 02:22:46.912]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:46.912 --> 02:22:50.216]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.216 --> 02:22:50.276]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.276 --> 02:22:50.596]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.596 --> 02:22:50.797]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.714 --> 02:23:04.817]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:23:04.817 --> 02:23:07.699]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:23:07.699 --> 02:23:09.780]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:12.022]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:23:12.022 --> 02:23:13.663]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:23:13.663 --> 02:23:17.986]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:24:08.277 --> 02:24:14.881]  I'm going to play a clip of Ron Paul talking about the attempted gold manipulation by the IMF when we come out of the next break.
[02:24:14.881 --> 02:24:19.605]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:24:19.605 --> 02:24:29.111]  Bob, the mainstream media and the IMF, the World Bank, the G20 have gone from saying, will we go off the dollar to yes, we're going off of it and it's now begun.
[02:24:29.111 --> 02:24:31.793]  Will it be a long protracted death or a quick death?
[02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:35.807]  Why does the establishment want this?
[02:24:35.807 --> 02:24:38.349]  Why are they doing this?
[02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:43.093]  This jobless recovery, oxymoron, over 10% unemployment.
[02:24:43.093 --> 02:24:44.514]  Those are Cook numbers.
[02:24:44.514 --> 02:24:46.956]  Break it down for us.
[02:24:46.956 --> 02:24:50.580]  Well, the unemployment numbers are easy.
[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:53.622]  That's U3 that they're talking about.
[02:24:53.622 --> 02:24:58.847]  10.2% up from nine and three quarters percent, nine and five eighths, whatever it was.
[02:24:59.625 --> 02:25:11.094]  The real figure is the U6, which is 17.5% by their 7 and 5 8th percent, according to their own figures.
[02:25:11.094 --> 02:25:15.358]  That includes U3, which is the 10.2%.
[02:25:15.358 --> 02:25:23.844]  Those who are no longer receiving checks, those who are discouraged, and those who are forced to work part-time.
[02:25:23.844 --> 02:25:28.068]  There's one thing that's left out of there, and that is called the birth-death ratio.
[02:25:28.772 --> 02:25:34.273]  Which means the government says, well, gee, we can't check on everybody, so we'll guess.
[02:25:34.273 --> 02:25:36.773]  And so they always guess in their own favor.
[02:25:36.773 --> 02:25:39.474]  Except for twice in the last six years.
[02:25:39.474 --> 02:25:48.836]  And so with that said, if you extract the birth-death ratio, you will come up with a new unemployment figure of 22.4%.
[02:25:48.836 --> 02:25:52.356]  That is depression level, is it not?
[02:25:58.011 --> 02:26:00.672]  It's right on the fringe.
[02:26:00.672 --> 02:26:03.693]  At least in unemployment.
[02:26:03.693 --> 02:26:08.835]  And unemployment tends to be a lagging statistic.
[02:26:08.835 --> 02:26:16.757]  And that means that unemployment is going to get worse even if the economy gets a little better or better.
[02:26:16.757 --> 02:26:20.999]  And so I had projected in January, and we've talked about this before, 22%.
[02:26:20.999 --> 02:26:22.019]  And so I was wrong.
[02:26:26.594 --> 02:26:28.515]  It's a little higher than that.
[02:26:28.515 --> 02:26:30.075]  But that's okay.
[02:26:30.075 --> 02:26:35.177]  At the time I made the projection, the number was 13.5%.
[02:26:35.177 --> 02:26:37.879]  So, you know, we were pretty much on.
[02:26:37.879 --> 02:26:45.001]  Next year, it'll probably run sideways to slightly higher, maybe 23 or 4%.
[02:26:45.001 --> 02:26:48.703]  It all depends whether we get stimulus and how much the stimulus is.
[02:26:48.703 --> 02:26:50.403]  They're talking about it now.
[02:26:50.403 --> 02:26:54.365]  We projected $2 trillion in January for this coming year.
[02:26:55.543 --> 02:27:10.353]  Now it looks like they want to do somewhere between $400 and $800 billion stimulus from Congress, and they want the banks to lend the 14% decrease that they've instituted in the last year.
[02:27:10.353 --> 02:27:17.498]  And if they do that, they'll come up with about $1.5 to $2 trillion, which is right in the ballpark of what we were looking for.
[02:27:17.498 --> 02:27:19.539]  But it's only going to buy another year.
[02:27:19.539 --> 02:27:23.662]  All they're doing is throwing money at this thing, and it's not solving the problem.
[02:27:24.122 --> 02:27:27.345]  I was about to say, buy us another year until total collapse.
[02:27:27.345 --> 02:27:35.192]  I mean, the people are losing their jobs, the industry is falling apart, retail sales are plunging.
[02:27:35.192 --> 02:27:48.784]  Every indicator is that the crash is already here, but we have all these painted trollops, the Infobabes, and the cutesy guys for the girls on Fox and CNN and MSNBC and CNBC.
[02:27:49.725 --> 02:27:57.448]  Explaining to us that, well, it's bad for you, but good for the banks, so the economy's good.
[02:27:57.448 --> 02:27:59.789]  Well, that's rather jaded.
[02:27:59.789 --> 02:28:10.093]  The whole thing is a scam, and as much as the banks, the brokerage firms, and the insurance companies, and transnationals caused this problem in the first place.
[02:28:10.093 --> 02:28:14.114]  And they're the ones that are getting bailout, not the transnational, but the others.
[02:28:14.114 --> 02:28:16.855]  And so very little has gone to the public.
[02:28:16.855 --> 02:28:18.236]  And I know this is going to
[02:28:19.308 --> 02:28:23.231]  And that's like a band-aid on an axe wound?
[02:28:23.231 --> 02:28:23.612]  Exactly.
[02:28:23.612 --> 02:28:26.394]  Now, you asked for a timeline here.
[02:28:26.394 --> 02:28:30.357]  It must have been six months since Paul Craig Roberts and I were on here together.
[02:28:46.187 --> 02:28:49.791]  And we both said, you know, two and a half to three years.
[02:28:49.791 --> 02:28:56.017]  Well, here we are six months later, and now it's a year and a half to two and a half years.
[02:28:56.017 --> 02:29:00.522]  And they're going to pull the plug up in that area sometime.
[02:29:00.522 --> 02:29:07.168]  And so that would put us into 2011 and a half to 2012 and a half.
[02:29:07.168 --> 02:29:09.871]  Somewhere in there, and that's when the whole house is going to fall down.
[02:29:12.219 --> 02:29:17.864]  And you better have gold and silver coins, because if you don't, you're going to be in deep doo-doo.
[02:29:17.864 --> 02:29:21.888]  These guys get bubbles in their heads, Alex, believe me.
[02:29:21.888 --> 02:29:23.509]  I mean, they don't know what to do.
[02:29:23.509 --> 02:29:24.230]  They've been so wrong so often.
[02:29:31.777 --> 02:29:33.978]  It's just totally pathetic.
[02:29:33.978 --> 02:29:35.399]  Okay, well then let's discuss.
[02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:39.941]  Let's take inflation officially since 1980.
[02:29:39.941 --> 02:29:40.441]  We've got a break.
[02:29:40.441 --> 02:29:41.442]  We've got a break.
[02:29:41.442 --> 02:29:42.382]  Come back, Bob.
[02:29:42.382 --> 02:29:45.144]  We'll be right back after this break with Bob, and he'll give us those numbers.
[02:29:45.144 --> 02:29:46.624]  I'm going to play this Ron Paul clip.
[02:29:46.624 --> 02:29:47.965]  Go to your phone calls.
[02:29:47.965 --> 02:29:50.526]  Bob Chabon, The International Forecaster.com is our guest.
[02:29:50.526 --> 02:29:51.587]  Infowars.com is our site.
[02:29:51.587 --> 02:29:52.927]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.927 --> 02:29:55.449]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.449 --> 02:29:58.150]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.657 --> 02:30:04.780]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:07.642]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[02:31:00.438 --> 02:31:05.001]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:05.902]  Number one.
[02:31:05.902 --> 02:31:09.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.324 --> 02:31:10.185]  Number two.
[02:31:10.185 --> 02:31:15.088]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.088 --> 02:31:15.829]  It's true.
[02:31:15.829 --> 02:31:20.372]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.692 --> 02:31:21.513]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.513 --> 02:31:25.096]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.096 --> 02:31:29.019]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.019 --> 02:31:29.819]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.819 --> 02:31:32.581]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.581 --> 02:31:36.264]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.264 --> 02:31:37.045]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.045 --> 02:31:41.188]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.188 --> 02:31:45.952]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.252 --> 02:31:50.418]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.418 --> 02:31:52.201]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.201 --> 02:31:54.464]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.464 --> 02:31:56.808]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:08.153]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:32:08.153 --> 02:32:14.235]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:32:14.235 --> 02:32:16.896]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:32:17.196 --> 02:32:23.460]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:27.543]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:27.543 --> 02:32:32.846]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:33.146 --> 02:32:35.228]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.228 --> 02:32:36.990]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:39.512]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.512 --> 02:32:44.257]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.257 --> 02:32:47.960]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:51.083]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:51.083 --> 02:32:52.985]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:52.985 --> 02:32:55.087]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:01.519 --> 02:33:04.288]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:33:04.288 --> 02:33:07.077]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:17.346]  Nick, Jeff, Randy, Arnold, Mark, many others, we're going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:17.346 --> 02:33:17.926]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:17.926 --> 02:33:25.132]  Bob Chapman is our guest today with us five minutes into the next hour, joins us every Friday in the third hour.
[02:33:25.132 --> 02:33:37.803]  I just briefly today want to remind listeners that we have a secure online video bookstore, shopping cart, there's Patriot t-shirts, all sorts of ways to get the message out about freedom and to identify the globalist.
[02:33:38.303 --> 02:33:54.819]  You wear one of our Come and Take It t-shirts, or one of our Don't Tread on Me t-shirts, or one of our Infowars.com t-shirts, you will meet like-minded people at the golf range, or at the movies, or at work, or at a comedy club, or at the grocery store, or walking your dog.
[02:33:55.439 --> 02:34:00.061]  That's what we have the t-shirts and ball caps and materials for, and that also funds our operation.
[02:34:00.061 --> 02:34:01.842]  So when you're on the site, be sure and check into that.
[02:34:01.842 --> 02:34:09.446]  A lot of new t-shirts we've added, a lot of new designs, and of course my newest film, Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:09.446 --> 02:34:10.327]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:11.624 --> 02:34:21.595]  Fall of the Republic is available right now, and people are ready to wake up, but they don't have all the information.
[02:34:21.595 --> 02:34:22.856]  This film will give it to them.
[02:34:22.856 --> 02:34:24.258]  Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:24.258 --> 02:34:26.660]  Infowars.com to get the DVD, or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:26.700]  888-253-3139.
[02:34:34.088 --> 02:34:48.179]  You can also go to PrisonPlanet.tv if you're a member and watch the live TV show that we simulcast on the radio, see all my films at super high quality, get my book on ebook, Paul Watson's book on ebook, and so much more when you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:34:48.179 --> 02:34:50.501]  Let's go ahead now and play this.
[02:34:50.501 --> 02:34:53.123]  Well, let's have Bob finish the point he was trying to make.
[02:34:53.123 --> 02:34:55.926]  Then I'm going to play this Ron Paul clip and go to your calls.
[02:34:55.926 --> 02:34:58.908]  Sorry that the satellite break cuts you off.
[02:34:58.908 --> 02:35:00.289]  Those are hard breaks, Bob.
[02:35:00.289 --> 02:35:01.310]  Go ahead and finish up your point.
[02:35:01.889 --> 02:35:09.251]  And so, official inflation since 1980 would make gold somewhere between $2,400 and $2,500 an ounce.
[02:35:09.251 --> 02:35:12.372]  That is the very minimum it should be selling at.
[02:35:12.372 --> 02:35:16.013]  My figure is, for official inflation since then, $6,700 an ounce.
[02:35:16.013 --> 02:35:16.973]  John Williams, who you all know,
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:30.316]  The eminent economist says it's $7,150 per ounce, and I'm not going to argue with him because he's a better economist than I am.
[02:35:30.316 --> 02:35:32.661]  So gold is vastly underpriced.
[02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:36.050]  Absolutely.
[02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:41.652]  Gold isn't going up because it's a bubble like oil or some other commodity.
[02:35:41.652 --> 02:35:56.936]  It's because the dollar's devalued and people worldwide are trying to get into something that's real and tangible because all the economists we've talked to have said that as the dollar goes, it's also going to hurt other global currencies and regional currencies.
[02:35:56.936 --> 02:35:59.457]  It's just they're not going to be hurt as bad.
[02:35:59.457 --> 02:36:03.258]  So there's a flight from currencies into hard assets, isn't there?
[02:36:04.696 --> 02:36:06.418]  That's exactly right.
[02:36:06.418 --> 02:36:09.700]  Everybody's going to get hurt in varying degrees.
[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:12.042]  And it's been happening for six years.
[02:36:12.042 --> 02:36:13.724]  It's nothing new.
[02:36:13.724 --> 02:36:18.968]  Every currency in the world has gone down against gold in the last six years.
[02:36:18.968 --> 02:36:29.737]  And they've all inflated by increasing money and credit and lowering interest rates and more money than they've got coming in.
[02:36:29.737 --> 02:36:30.238]  Amazing.
[02:36:31.909 --> 02:36:39.207]  What is the federal government going to do as the world starts refusing to buy their t-bills or buy their dollars and and and other government
[02:36:41.326 --> 02:36:47.312]  Offerings as Obama spends more money than all presidents before him combined.
[02:36:47.312 --> 02:36:48.533]  That's official.
[02:36:48.533 --> 02:36:51.536]  We thought Bush was bad, tripling the size of government.
[02:36:51.536 --> 02:36:53.598]  Obama has taken that to a whole new level.
[02:36:53.598 --> 02:36:54.679]  Of course, he's just a puppet.
[02:36:54.679 --> 02:36:57.581]  But the point is the establishment is doing this.
[02:36:57.581 --> 02:36:58.602]  What are they going to do?
[02:36:58.602 --> 02:37:02.826]  I guess just run dead up and steal, steal, steal until everything implodes and then
[02:37:05.778 --> 02:37:10.360]  Yes, they will.
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:23.347]  And it's not going to work unless, ultimately, they have a currency which is backed by gold.
[02:37:23.347 --> 02:37:30.090]  And so, going full circle, how are they going to be able to continue to finance the U.S.
[02:37:30.090 --> 02:37:30.390]  debt?
[02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:33.372]  The Federal Reserve, that private corporation,
[02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:36.351]  They have been monetizing debt.
[02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:49.855]  That means they've been printing money out of thin air and using it to buy Treasury bonds, agency bonds, which is Fannie, Freddie, and Jenny, and FHA.
[02:37:49.855 --> 02:37:55.116]  They've been making swaps with foreign nations, $500 billion at a time.
[02:37:55.116 --> 02:37:57.157]  They've injected $12.7 trillion
[02:37:59.792 --> 02:38:07.598]  Into the financial system, just through banking and Wall Street in the last year.
[02:38:07.598 --> 02:38:13.262]  We're on the hook for $23.4 trillion if we don't get any of the money back.
[02:38:13.262 --> 02:38:15.163]  I mean, the figures are astronomical.
[02:38:15.163 --> 02:38:21.107]  They'd be paid for by the great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren of us.
[02:38:21.107 --> 02:38:23.649]  And this is how buried we are.
[02:38:23.649 --> 02:38:25.070]  And the only way out of this thing
[02:38:25.709 --> 02:38:29.591]  I had him on a few weeks ago and he's beginning to revise
[02:38:51.745 --> 02:39:02.008]  His forecast of it being further out, he says that it's beginning to look like it may happen sooner rather than later, because the deterioration is accelerating.
[02:39:02.008 --> 02:39:05.649]  But I guess we're all here together and we're going to find out.
[02:39:05.649 --> 02:39:17.132]  Here's what Ron Paul had to say yesterday here live with us, when I asked him about the death of the dollar, and he said that he thought that would be more incremental, but then he got off into gold.
[02:39:17.132 --> 02:39:18.412]  Here's Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:39:19.488 --> 02:39:20.689]  It's going to hurt the economy.
[02:39:20.689 --> 02:39:25.013]  I wouldn't say it's abandoned, but it's less important all the time.
[02:39:25.013 --> 02:39:30.098]  I mean, the fact that they can still have 60% reserves means it's still there.
[02:39:30.098 --> 02:39:35.724]  But the market, I look at the market signals, and I think the thing that happened this week was very, very significant.
[02:39:36.364 --> 02:39:41.568]  That is when the IMF announces that they're going to dump 200 tons of gold on the market.
[02:39:41.568 --> 02:39:50.153]  Well, you know, ordinarily, a person would think, and they were hoping, well, a lot of that gold out there, that's going to drive down the price of gold and make all the fiat currencies look better.
[02:39:50.153 --> 02:39:51.334]  But what happened?
[02:39:51.334 --> 02:40:02.721]  A bank from Asia, India, buys the whole lot, which sent a signal, I think, to the world markets that, in essence, gold has been remonetized.
[02:40:02.721 --> 02:40:04.803]  It never gets demonetized, but it has less
[02:40:05.103 --> 02:40:05.784]  We're good to go.
[02:40:32.724 --> 02:40:35.665]  And they cannot be thrown gold.
[02:40:35.665 --> 02:40:39.407]  They can disrupt and play these games for a long, long time.
[02:40:39.407 --> 02:40:48.050]  But in many ways, this is very, very good because it tells us that the governments no longer can get away with just printing money to finance their schemes.
[02:40:48.050 --> 02:40:52.952]  It's their schemes that are so damaging to us, whether it's the welfare or the warfare.
[02:40:52.952 --> 02:40:55.433]  It all hurts the people because they have to pay the bills.
[02:40:55.433 --> 02:41:01.396]  So some of these things are good signals, although it means that we have to be concerned about the chaos that might erupt.
[02:41:03.015 --> 02:41:09.261]  All right, that was a short snippet of Ron Paul's interview with us live here yesterday.
[02:41:09.261 --> 02:41:12.705]  Bob, your comments on that?
[02:41:12.705 --> 02:41:26.118]  Totally along the lines of what Ted Anderson and I have been talking about for a long time, and I agree and I'm sure Ted does, and I think that we're right on course.
[02:41:26.118 --> 02:41:26.919]  My feeling is
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:30.641]  This thing was all created for a reason.
[02:41:30.641 --> 02:41:32.322]  It just didn't happen.
[02:41:32.322 --> 02:41:42.647]  And I think there's a point along the way that they had planned to switch from the inflationary depression to the deflationary.
[02:41:42.647 --> 02:41:56.353]  And I think that their plans have been so disrupted by your program and programs like it and the International Forecaster and others who not only tell you what's going on in that realm and others, but also
[02:41:57.543 --> 02:42:01.068]  The total truth of who's behind it and what they're doing.
[02:42:01.068 --> 02:42:05.414]  And your next guest, in a way, is going to be telling you the same thing.
[02:42:05.414 --> 02:42:08.318]  I mean, these people on Wall Street are criminals.
[02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:08.658]  I know.
[02:42:08.658 --> 02:42:09.219]  I've been there.
[02:42:09.219 --> 02:42:09.720]  I've done that.
[02:42:10.987 --> 02:42:27.878]  Did you read the McClatchy newspaper and big investigation with an award-winning financial writer actually got the internal Goldman Sachs documents where they planned to sell the housing market derivatives knowing they were going to implode?
[02:42:28.698 --> 02:42:28.998]  Wanting
[02:42:47.992 --> 02:43:00.416]  As I had another guest on and as I covered that article again, I remembered how over a year ago you had said exactly what was happening and now so many others are saying it.
[02:43:00.416 --> 02:43:09.300]  And of course we have Professor Black, one of the former top federal investigators, he's in Fall of the Republic, saying the same thing.
[02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:13.821]  I mean it's really coming out that these guys are a bunch of crooks.
[02:43:13.821 --> 02:43:15.682]  Well what you were referring to were
[02:43:16.329 --> 02:43:40.370]  was that they were selling CDOs, Collateralized Debt Obligations, and they were bonds which contained mortgages and pieces of mortgages, and they browbeat the rating agencies S&P, Moody's, and Fitch into giving them AAA ratings, when in fact their ratings were BBB, the difference between a 10 and a 3.
[02:43:41.659 --> 02:43:46.880]  And they knew that this toxic garbage was going to start falling apart.
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:59.524]  So the minute they sold them to the buyers, and of course they did have some still in inventory when all this happened, they sold them to the buyers and then they shorted them.
[02:43:59.524 --> 02:44:08.106]  They bet that they were going to go down and here they've just sold them on the long side to institutions throughout the world, particularly in Europe.
[02:44:08.689 --> 02:44:14.030]  And then they turn around and shorted the market at the same time and that's what the writer is talking about.
[02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:18.191]  Now let's explain this.
[02:44:18.191 --> 02:44:23.512]  You have a bond and you sell it to Alex Jones, Goldman Sachs does.
[02:44:23.512 --> 02:44:35.534]  Then they turn around and they go into the market and they sell the bond that you just bought just like they wanted to go down because
[02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:42.415]  When you sell short, it has a tendency to make the bond of the stock to go lower.
[02:44:42.415 --> 02:44:45.577]  And if other people see that, they'll sell too.
[02:44:45.577 --> 02:44:52.922]  So if they sell the bond short at par, which is $1,000, it may go down to $95 or $90.
[02:44:52.922 --> 02:45:03.850]  And then somewhere along the way, they're going to buy their short position back, and they're going to make a profit on the downside by betting that your bond is going down, which it did.
[02:45:04.284 --> 02:45:14.704]  I was about to say, so in layman's terms, Goldman Sachs, unlike any other group, has regulators internationally, in the Treasury, in the Private Fellow Reserve, in the government,
[02:45:15.783 --> 02:45:18.445]  On record, running everything.
[02:45:18.445 --> 02:45:24.630]  They go out and package crap derivatives, knowing it's crud, knowing it's bad mortgages.
[02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:27.332]  They get it AAA rated as solid gold.
[02:45:27.332 --> 02:45:30.054]  They tell everybody it's great in press releases.
[02:45:30.054 --> 02:45:39.762]  They sell it to banks, institutions, individuals, to the investing world, to governments, to CalPERS in California, to your school district, to the cop,
[02:45:40.442 --> 02:45:43.644]  Union, pension funds, everything.
[02:45:43.644 --> 02:45:46.606]  They know it's a time bomb.
[02:45:46.606 --> 02:45:54.312]  They know it's a car that's going to blow up in an hour, but they sell it to you off the lot, knowing it's going to explode and kill everybody on board.
[02:45:54.312 --> 02:45:59.315]  Then to make sure it happens, it's already crap, they go out and bet against it to drive it down.
[02:45:59.315 --> 02:46:00.956]  Then it goes way down.
[02:46:00.956 --> 02:46:08.962]  Then they use government bailout money to come buy it back up, what has value, picking and choosing, at literally dimes on the dollar,
[02:46:09.622 --> 02:46:09.902]  I think?
[02:46:29.654 --> 02:46:36.357]  That was so brilliant that I think that you might get a letter or a call from Goldman Sachs asking you to go to work for them.
[02:46:36.357 --> 02:46:39.418]  That was perfect, Alex, and you know, I know that you're not someone
[02:46:56.178 --> 02:46:59.479]  Who has been trained in that industry, and that was a wonderful explanation.
[02:46:59.479 --> 02:47:00.580]  Thank you.
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:02.821]  Well, no, I'm just here every day reading it, looking at it.
[02:47:02.821 --> 02:47:11.505]  I mean, you know, I, I mean, I just understand what the central, I mean, that's what Rothschild did in 1815, staging the collapse of the market so he could buy it up.
[02:47:11.505 --> 02:47:15.186]  I mean, it's the same trick, just more sophisticated.
[02:47:15.186 --> 02:47:16.947]  That's right.
[02:47:16.947 --> 02:47:18.608]  And I'm glad writers are getting on this.
[02:47:18.608 --> 02:47:20.809]  I don't have time to write special item
[02:47:21.551 --> 02:47:27.796]  I'm just blown away by how bold Goldman Sachs is, and of course they're just one of the culprits.
[02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:53.049]  They just don't care.
[02:47:53.049 --> 02:47:55.572]  They are a law unto themselves.
[02:47:55.572 --> 02:47:59.918]  They're crooks in $3,000 suits.
[02:47:59.918 --> 02:48:03.742]  They don't care about the Constitution, the laws.
[02:48:03.742 --> 02:48:06.205]  The SEC protects them.
[02:48:06.205 --> 02:48:09.790]  And, you know, did Shapiro work for the SEC?
[02:48:12.670 --> 02:48:22.652]  You know, there's so many of their alumni, so to speak, in banking worldwide, as you pointed out, as well as in the brokerage businesses that have gone to Washington.
[02:48:22.652 --> 02:48:23.733]  It's ludicrous.
[02:48:23.733 --> 02:48:25.073]  Now, it's not new.
[02:48:25.073 --> 02:48:29.654]  There have been other firms, Dylan Reed and JPMorgan Chase.
[02:48:29.654 --> 02:48:33.355]  JPMorgan used to be the anointed ones.
[02:48:34.034 --> 02:48:42.581]  And in current years, Goldman Sachs has come along and taken over the helm, so to speak, for the Treasury.
[02:48:42.581 --> 02:48:45.203]  JPMorgan Chase for the Fed.
[02:48:45.203 --> 02:48:47.265]  And one handles one area and one handles the other.
[02:48:47.265 --> 02:48:49.206]  But they run the country.
[02:48:49.206 --> 02:48:51.448]  And we've got to stop them.
[02:48:51.448 --> 02:48:52.829]  So we have a gang of crooks.
[02:48:52.829 --> 02:48:55.752]  Because they want world government, and that's what this is all about.
[02:48:56.596 --> 02:48:57.837]  Exactly.
[02:48:57.837 --> 02:49:04.421]  Because then they're the world government, and they write the laws, they control the army, and they can legalize all their crimes.
[02:49:04.421 --> 02:49:12.587]  Right now is an important transition for them because they've been doing it under color of law, but if they're able to get their police state in place, heaven help us.
[02:49:14.475 --> 02:49:22.622]  Why is Goldman Sachs, every time we turn over a rock, why is one of their alumni in a federal regulatory position?
[02:49:22.622 --> 02:49:32.650]  I mean, I don't see many regulatory positions where you don't have a Goldman Sachs ringwraith in there in the cockpit.
[02:49:32.650 --> 02:49:34.391]  It's planned that way.
[02:49:34.391 --> 02:49:38.494]  Look at the seamless change between Bush and Obama.
[02:49:38.494 --> 02:49:42.738]  Team A replaced Team B. Where did they come from?
[02:49:43.425 --> 02:49:52.743]  All the bureaucrats, the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberger Group, hardcore alumnus, they all want world government.
[02:49:52.743 --> 02:49:55.548]  We didn't have any change, and so it's all the same.
[02:49:58.743 --> 02:50:15.446]  You know, it must be great if you're just totally ruthless and evil, and I mean that sarcastically, but it must just be great because they get to take over, kill, enslave, bankrupt whoever they want, and then talk about how great they are building this great new world order when they're just a bunch of criminals.
[02:50:15.446 --> 02:50:21.187]  Not only that, most of them are pedophiles.
[02:50:21.187 --> 02:50:23.888]  Man, these people... That's even more sickening.
[02:50:27.987 --> 02:50:31.369]  Do you think that they've gone too far, though, Bob?
[02:50:31.369 --> 02:50:33.791]  Well, they have, but we have to play it out.
[02:50:33.791 --> 02:50:37.574]  And they're going to have to make their moves, and we're going to have to make ours.
[02:50:37.574 --> 02:50:42.537]  They think they've got the Army in their pocket, and they're sadly mistaken.
[02:50:42.537 --> 02:50:44.078]  They're not going to follow them.
[02:50:44.078 --> 02:50:50.803]  I haven't asked you yet what you think of the shooting at Fort Hood.
[02:50:50.803 --> 02:50:51.944]  Too early to tell, Alex.
[02:50:53.285 --> 02:50:54.286]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[02:50:54.286 --> 02:50:55.688]  But the truth will come out later.
[02:50:55.688 --> 02:50:58.832]  But by then, nobody will be paying attention.
[02:50:58.832 --> 02:50:59.974]  Your call straight ahead.
[02:50:59.974 --> 02:51:01.596]  Two more segments with Bob Chapman.
[02:51:01.596 --> 02:51:02.277]  Stay with us.
[02:51:02.277 --> 02:51:06.883]  Worried that inflation will ruin your retirement or plans of sending your kids to college?
[02:51:06.883 --> 02:51:07.864]  Get a pencil.
[02:51:07.864 --> 02:51:08.265]  Discover
[02:51:08.305 --> 02:51:08.745]  We're good to go.
[02:51:30.627 --> 02:51:37.432]  Scott Smith is the former senior executive of Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newsletter.
[02:51:37.432 --> 02:51:43.496]  He's urging everyone afraid of the nearly $2 trillion in new debt to get his inflation survival kit.
[02:51:43.496 --> 02:51:48.360]  It details seven must-own stocks, including a gold stock with six-figure potential.
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:51.881]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:51.881 --> 02:51:53.882]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:53.882 --> 02:51:55.363]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.788 --> 02:52:15.889]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.889 --> 02:52:21.830]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:27.031]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:27.031 --> 02:52:30.292]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:30.292 --> 02:52:37.013]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:37.133 --> 02:52:39.474]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.474 --> 02:52:41.075]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:41.075 --> 02:52:43.536]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.536 --> 02:52:45.657]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.657 --> 02:52:50.799]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.799 --> 02:52:59.922]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:03.641 --> 02:53:05.642]  Remain in your houses.
[02:53:05.642 --> 02:53:11.424]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:53:11.424 --> 02:53:12.784]  Will they do it?
[02:53:12.784 --> 02:53:15.405]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:53:15.405 --> 02:53:21.847]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:53:21.847 --> 02:53:24.048]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:53:24.048 --> 02:53:26.088]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[02:53:28.329 --> 02:53:33.190]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:38.131]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:53:38.131 --> 02:53:43.852]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:53:43.852 --> 02:53:52.274]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[02:53:52.274 --> 02:53:54.774]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[02:53:54.774 --> 02:53:57.535]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[02:53:57.875 --> 02:54:01.296]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[02:54:01.296 --> 02:54:13.521]  Let's go to Nick in New Jersey.
[02:54:13.521 --> 02:54:14.362]  Nick, you're on the air.
[02:54:14.362 --> 02:54:15.262]  Welcome.
[02:54:15.262 --> 02:54:17.903]  Hey, this is my first time calling.
[02:54:17.903 --> 02:54:19.784]  Welcome.
[02:54:19.784 --> 02:54:21.905]  I heard Mr. Chapman speak.
[02:54:23.496 --> 02:54:33.279]  It makes me sad to know that the Justice Department, the CIA, and the FBI, just who's running those damn companies, you know?
[02:54:33.279 --> 02:54:46.743]  And I was in a march when we went down to Washington, D.C., and all of these buildings were on the same street, and if I had a paper and pencil, I would have put signs up, for sale, for rent, out of business, bank sale, you know what I mean?
[02:54:47.523 --> 02:54:49.805]  Those buildings are right out there, right on the corner.
[02:54:49.805 --> 02:54:52.047]  Well, that's what tyranny is.
[02:54:52.047 --> 02:54:53.208]  Well, that's what tyranny is.
[02:54:53.208 --> 02:54:57.751]  It's when criminal interests come in, get control of your government and start robbing you.
[02:54:57.751 --> 02:54:59.733]  And it happens everywhere else on the planet.
[02:54:59.733 --> 02:55:00.994]  It's happening here.
[02:55:00.994 --> 02:55:10.041]  We better grow up and admit it and tell these people, stop it and start bringing them to justice because they're not going to quit until we grow a backbone.
[02:55:10.041 --> 02:55:12.503]  Bob Shetman.
[02:55:12.503 --> 02:55:13.704]  That's the way to do it.
[02:55:13.704 --> 02:55:15.165]  And that's why we're getting the word out.
[02:55:15.737 --> 02:55:20.941]  And that's why you're going to Washington and letting them know that you don't agree with what's going on.
[02:55:20.941 --> 02:55:23.303]  They had that march on Thursday.
[02:55:23.303 --> 02:55:25.985]  It appeared in none of the major media.
[02:55:25.985 --> 02:55:27.646]  Except for them calling them racist.
[02:55:27.646 --> 02:55:29.127]  It had nothing to do with race.
[02:55:29.127 --> 02:55:30.768]  They don't want government-run health care.
[02:55:30.768 --> 02:55:32.990]  They can't run cash for clunkers.
[02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:34.531]  They can't run this.
[02:55:34.531 --> 02:55:36.753]  And that's being nice to them.
[02:55:36.753 --> 02:55:37.633]  Nick, good to hear from you.
[02:55:37.633 --> 02:55:39.475]  How do they think they're going to get away with that?
[02:55:39.475 --> 02:55:41.556]  Because it's a non sequitur.
[02:55:41.556 --> 02:55:44.098]  It has nothing to do with what they were doing.
[02:55:44.098 --> 02:55:44.979]  I mean, stupid!
[02:55:46.863 --> 02:55:51.905]  I'm talking about the government and the media and saying those things.
[02:55:51.905 --> 02:55:52.505]  It's amazing.
[02:55:52.505 --> 02:55:54.386]  Let's talk to Arnold in California.
[02:55:54.386 --> 02:55:56.567]  Arnold, welcome.
[02:55:56.567 --> 02:55:57.348]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[02:55:57.348 --> 02:55:59.288]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[02:55:59.288 --> 02:56:00.529]  First time caller.
[02:56:00.529 --> 02:56:02.750]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:07.112]  And here's something that I quite don't understand.
[02:56:07.112 --> 02:56:12.814]  It seems like the CIA seems to be more connected in doing business outside of the U.S.
[02:56:12.814 --> 02:56:14.095]  to hoard all this money
[02:56:15.483 --> 02:56:23.386]  In the international trade, and I know that because I'm somewhat connected internationally, and this is what I always hear from the people.
[02:56:23.386 --> 02:56:30.709]  Before you can do anything, it seems like you have to give the CIA their cut first.
[02:56:30.709 --> 02:56:33.650]  Bob?
[02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:36.372]  First of all, I don't have first-hand knowledge.
[02:56:36.372 --> 02:56:38.352]  Historically, I do.
[02:56:38.352 --> 02:56:42.434]  And I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't extorting everybody.
[02:56:45.043 --> 02:56:47.466]  It is a criminal organization.
[02:56:47.466 --> 02:56:55.855]  Well, the thing is, I was in the military myself, and I know that every branch of the military has their own intelligence.
[02:56:55.855 --> 02:57:02.482]  And it seems like if the CIA supposedly has intelligence outside of the U.S., why do we need them if the military already has their own?
[02:57:04.298 --> 02:57:05.998]  Well, it's a good question.
[02:57:05.998 --> 02:57:10.820]  It's something that existed starting in the late 1930s, modeled on MI6.
[02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:13.140]  It was OSS.
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:16.741]  In 1948, it became the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:57:16.741 --> 02:57:22.783]  In 1953, it was brought under the National Security Agency, which was formed that year.
[02:57:22.783 --> 02:57:24.003]  So it became part of it.
[02:57:24.003 --> 02:57:26.384]  And that same year, the Army Security Agency
[02:57:26.846 --> 02:57:29.387]  was formed and I work for them.
[02:57:29.387 --> 02:57:34.770]  So I worked indirectly with both those organizations, particularly NSA.
[02:57:34.770 --> 02:57:51.679]  And so the CIA exists probably so that Wall Street and others can run the opium trade and extort money from people and pull scams like Madoff and the Nugent hand episode and things like that.
[02:57:51.679 --> 02:57:53.520]  I mean, these guys are top criminals.
[02:57:54.335 --> 02:57:57.596]  And there's no doubt that the opium trade founded Skull & Bones.
[02:57:57.596 --> 02:58:00.097]  It founded out of OSS CIA.
[02:58:00.097 --> 02:58:03.557]  That's in mainline history of the CIA.
[02:58:03.557 --> 02:58:09.659]  And you've got all these other compartmentalized federal intelligence groups and international intelligence groups.
[02:58:09.659 --> 02:58:16.901]  And there's a lot of good people that work for them, but they're all compartmentalized doing a separate job that isn't part of the criminal hierarchy.
[02:58:17.461 --> 02:58:19.242]  Bob Chapman, we're going to let you go.

[02:58:31.847 --> 02:58:36.249]  Well, I thank you, and thanks everybody for listening, and I'll be here next week.
[02:58:36.249 --> 02:58:37.150]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:37.150 --> 02:58:37.570]  Take care.
[02:58:37.570 --> 02:58:38.450]  There he goes.
[02:58:38.450 --> 02:58:43.412]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:58:43.412 --> 02:58:44.573]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.885 --> 02:58:52.130]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.130 --> 02:58:56.153]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.153 --> 02:58:59.395]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.395 --> 02:59:04.198]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.198 --> 02:59:10.583]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.583 --> 02:59:12.825]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.365 --> 02:59:13.665]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.665 --> 02:59:14.166]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.166 --> 02:59:14.966]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.966 --> 02:59:16.127]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.127 --> 02:59:18.368]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.256 --> 02:59:34.398]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.398 --> 02:59:39.541]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.541 --> 02:59:53.972]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:53.972 --> 02:59:56.374]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.374 --> 02:59:59.136]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.993 --> 03:00:17.677]  We are back live, continuing with your phone calls and covering the news in this hour.
[03:00:20.316 --> 03:00:22.518]  So much going on with the economy.
[03:00:22.518 --> 03:00:23.579]  Joblessness.
[03:00:23.579 --> 03:00:26.342]  Federal government's reporting at above 10 percent.
[03:00:26.342 --> 03:00:28.684]  How can we have a jobless recovery?
[03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:35.711]  There's also been a terrible shooting in Florida in an Orlando office building.
[03:00:35.711 --> 03:00:37.713]  At least eight people shot there.
[03:00:40.339 --> 03:00:51.383]  And of course you have the 12 dead, 30 plus wounded at Fort Hood with all the security there, showing that nothing can stop a nut, except for the Second Amendment.
[03:00:51.383 --> 03:00:57.385]  And this female police officer who reportedly shot this individual four times and stopped him.
[03:00:57.385 --> 03:01:00.346]  Thank God that she didn't wait like they did at Blacksburg and other places.
[03:01:00.346 --> 03:01:03.827]  She charged in and took this guy out.
[03:01:03.827 --> 03:01:06.208]  So she certainly deserves a lot of praise.
[03:01:07.168 --> 03:01:13.771]  Okay, we're going to break here in a few minutes, but he'll be with us for several segments, and I'm really excited about this interview because I saw the article
[03:01:34.531 --> 03:01:55.931]  In McClatchy Newspapers, not this Sunday but last Sunday, and it dovetailed with Professor Black we've had on, a federal regulator, former federal regulator, and so many, John Perkins who we've had on, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, all these other insiders talking about Goldman Sachs is just really involved in a lot of amazing behavior.
[03:01:55.931 --> 03:01:58.974]  But the headline is, How Goldman Sachs Secretly Bet on the U.S.
[03:01:58.974 --> 03:01:59.975]  Housing Crash
[03:02:01.158 --> 03:02:06.559]  And to go over that is the author, the investigative reporter, award-winning investigative reporter, Greg Gordon.
[03:02:06.559 --> 03:02:14.480]  And he's written for some of the biggest newspapers in the country and right now is writing for McClatchy News Service and newspapers.
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:22.102]  And he's broken a lot of just huge international investigative stories.
[03:02:22.102 --> 03:02:23.922]  And maybe later we can talk about a few of those.
[03:02:23.922 --> 03:02:26.922]  But to talk about Goldman Sachs secretly bet on U.S.
[03:02:26.922 --> 03:02:29.183]  housing crash is Greg Gordon.
[03:02:29.183 --> 03:02:30.383]  Greg, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:02:32.814 --> 03:02:42.843]  We're about to go to break, but just in a nutshell, this is one of the most in-depth, detailed investigative reports I've seen on the banking industry and Goldman Sachs.
[03:02:42.843 --> 03:02:44.564]  This is just an amazing job.
[03:02:44.564 --> 03:02:46.946]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:46.946 --> 03:02:50.029]  In a nutshell, what did you discover?
[03:02:50.029 --> 03:02:55.414]  Well, we wanted to find out how Goldman Sachs got out when nobody else
[03:02:56.315 --> 03:02:57.515]  It did.
[03:02:57.515 --> 03:03:04.397]  And so, the first story of the series is really about how Goldman was selling off.
[03:03:04.397 --> 03:03:06.517]  At some stage, it became a sell-off.
[03:03:06.517 --> 03:03:19.920]  We don't know exactly what that date is, but in 2006 and 2007, Goldman sold $39 billion of bonds, essentially bonds backed by risky mortgages registered in the United States.
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:27.783]  And these securities, many of them have gone south.
[03:03:27.783 --> 03:03:38.728]  And then, in addition, Goldman was peddling more exotic securities, many of which were tied, again, to risky mortgages in the United States offshore.
[03:03:38.728 --> 03:03:49.253]  And at the same time, Goldman was betting in these dark markets through devices that are known as credit default swaps, but they're basically insurance-like bets.
[03:03:50.273 --> 03:04:01.816]  You're buying a little insurance policy on some specific thing, and they were betting that the housing market would go south and that these bonds would all lose value.
[03:04:01.816 --> 03:04:15.739]  So they start quietly dumping on the market AAA rated paper that was tied to derivatives, or exotic instruments as they're called, and at the same time betting against it after they dumped it.
[03:04:15.739 --> 03:04:17.300]  Man, that is amazing.
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:21.641]  Well, I want to be clear.
[03:04:21.641 --> 03:04:30.663]  They were making bets on similar, but not exactly the same security, but on similar issues.
[03:04:30.663 --> 03:04:33.563]  So, in other words, they were betting that the housing market's going to go bad.
[03:04:33.563 --> 03:04:43.566]  And if the housing market goes bad, all these mortgages are going to go south, or many of the mortgages, because people are going to find themselves underwater in their houses.
[03:04:43.566 --> 03:04:48.367]  We know people across the country have homes that are worth less than their mortgages.
[03:04:48.647 --> 03:04:49.068]  Sure, sure.
[03:04:49.068 --> 03:04:50.029]  That's been well documented.
[03:04:50.029 --> 03:04:53.952]  We're going to break, come back in a long segment, get more into this incredible article.
[03:04:53.952 --> 03:04:56.795]  And he's saying it's the first in a series.
[03:04:56.795 --> 03:04:58.016]  Can't wait to read more.
[03:04:58.016 --> 03:04:58.537]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.882 --> 03:05:10.029]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:05:10.029 --> 03:05:13.411]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:05:13.411 --> 03:05:19.276]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:05:19.276 --> 03:05:24.059]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:05:24.059 --> 03:05:26.401]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:05:26.681 --> 03:05:27.062]  I think?
[03:05:43.325 --> 03:05:43.525]  Thank you.
[03:06:01.530 --> 03:06:04.552]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.552 --> 03:06:09.877]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.877 --> 03:06:11.918]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.918 --> 03:06:16.922]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.922 --> 03:06:17.843]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.103 --> 03:06:19.224]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.224 --> 03:06:21.106]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.106 --> 03:06:22.186]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.186 --> 03:06:24.388]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.388 --> 03:06:25.729]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.729 --> 03:06:27.251]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.251 --> 03:06:32.535]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.535 --> 03:06:36.118]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.118 --> 03:06:39.581]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.921 --> 03:06:41.142]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.142 --> 03:06:42.043]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.043 --> 03:06:43.143]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.143 --> 03:06:44.084]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.084 --> 03:06:45.185]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.185 --> 03:06:48.227]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:08:02.110 --> 03:08:07.673]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.410 --> 03:08:14.633]  He's written multiple parts in a detailed series.
[03:08:14.633 --> 03:08:17.975]  The first of which we've been covering off and on for the last week and a half.
[03:08:17.975 --> 03:08:19.997]  How Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:08:19.997 --> 03:08:21.098]  housing crash.
[03:08:21.098 --> 03:08:25.501]  Let me just read you a couple lines from Greg Gordon's syndicated article.
[03:08:26.181 --> 03:08:40.479]  It says, uh, to piece together Goldman's role in subprime meltdown, McClatchy reviewed hundreds of documents, SEC filings, copies of secret investment circulars, lawsuits, and interviewed numerous people familiar with the firm's activities.
[03:08:41.818 --> 03:08:52.564]  And then they go through in this article, piece by piece, Mr. Gordon did, exactly how this was done.
[03:08:52.564 --> 03:08:58.608]  And so just stating in layman terms, what do we know Goldman Sachs did?
[03:08:58.608 --> 03:09:00.589]  They are the only big group to get out of this.
[03:09:00.589 --> 03:09:01.370]  You talk about how
[03:09:02.190 --> 03:09:06.654]  This was used against their competition like Bear Stearns and others.
[03:09:06.654 --> 03:09:10.937]  All these other groups went belly up, but Goldman Sachs came out smelling like a rose.
[03:09:10.937 --> 03:09:13.659]  Record profits, record bonuses.
[03:09:13.659 --> 03:09:14.359]  At the same time...
[03:09:15.685 --> 03:09:25.397]  We see an over-representation of Goldman Sachs alumni in regulatory and government positions, and I want to get into that with you as well.
[03:09:25.397 --> 03:09:30.923]  But I know as a journalist, you just want to stay to the facts, but I also want to talk about these documents that you got a hold of.
[03:09:30.923 --> 03:09:35.849]  But, I mean, let's go through exactly what's happening here and where this is going.
[03:09:37.088 --> 03:09:53.570]  And let me say that it's not an accident that so many Goldman executives go on to senior jobs in the government, because Goldman for decades has encouraged its members once they have attained
[03:09:56.997 --> 03:10:02.983]  Their wealth, to go and spend some time doing some public service, go work for the government.
[03:10:02.983 --> 03:10:18.317]  So, you know, it sounds noble, but the problem is that when the guys get into the government, they end up being Treasury Secretary or head of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which can regulate some of these derivatives, as you call them, that are traded
[03:10:20.501 --> 03:10:32.828]  You know, outside the normal markets, you create appearances at the minimum that are very awkward and in some cases disturbing.
[03:10:32.828 --> 03:10:43.455]  I hear you had Hank Paulson serving as the Treasury Secretary at the end of the Bush administration last fall, in September, when everything blew up.
[03:10:43.455 --> 03:10:48.878]  And it seemed as if every decision, every key decision that was made,
[03:10:49.730 --> 03:11:00.654]  Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it seems as if every key decision, where Goldman Sachs was a stakeholder, the decision benefited Goldman Sachs.
[03:11:00.654 --> 03:11:07.997]  They took over Bear Stearns when Bear Stearns collapsed, and Goldman had contracts with Bear.
[03:11:07.997 --> 03:11:10.558]  We don't talk about this in the series, but it's true.
[03:11:10.558 --> 03:11:15.160]  And Goldman was able to settle out when J.P.
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:17.261]  Morgan took over Bear Stearns.
[03:11:17.261 --> 03:11:19.122]  That was a deal arranged by Goldman.
[03:11:19.662 --> 03:11:20.545]  We're good.
[03:11:25.575 --> 03:11:26.295]  We're good to go.
[03:11:50.263 --> 03:12:06.512]  And then the decision was made to bail out AIG, the American International Group, and Goldman had placed $20 billion of these insurance-like bets with AIG, the American International Group.
[03:12:12.472 --> 03:12:17.914]  Goldman got paid off out of this money, others' rescue money from the government.
[03:12:17.914 --> 03:12:35.921]  Goldman was paid $12.9 billion, and over $8 billion of that related to its secret bets, hedging, its subprime and other related risky mortgage-backed securities.
[03:12:35.921 --> 03:12:38.502]  And it's also noteworthy that when these
[03:12:41.303 --> 03:12:44.729]  The 12.9 billion dollars was paid off.
[03:12:44.729 --> 03:12:46.913]  It was a hundred cents on the dollar.
[03:12:48.038 --> 03:12:57.925]  So, it was decided that even the officials at AIG wanted to offer considerably less money to the various counterparties on all these bets it was holding.
[03:12:57.925 --> 03:13:04.129]  And by the way, AIG made a dreadful mistake, because AIG did not reinsure all these bets.
[03:13:04.129 --> 03:13:07.391]  It just assumed that the housing market was going to go up forever.
[03:13:07.391 --> 03:13:17.017]  And when it turned south, all of a sudden, instead of just getting these nice premiums from Goldman and, I presume, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers every year, you know, paying
[03:13:18.559 --> 03:13:23.463]  Uh, maybe a hundred million dollars a year in premium so that they can have this insurance.
[03:13:23.463 --> 03:13:33.491]  All of a sudden, AIG had to reimburse them all and pay off maybe 50, 60 billion dollars.
[03:13:33.491 --> 03:13:36.634]  And it didn't have the money and that's when everything melted down.
[03:13:37.859 --> 03:13:48.161]  So, Goldman Sachs really always benefited from the decisions that were made by government officials, including its alumni.
[03:13:49.335 --> 03:13:51.056]  Greg Gordon's our guest.
[03:13:51.056 --> 03:13:57.520]  He's an investigative journalist with McClatchy Washington Bureau, and there's several parts in the series.
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:13:59.581]  One is how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:13:59.581 --> 03:14:00.341]  housing crash.
[03:14:00.341 --> 03:14:04.483]  Another, Goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes.
[03:14:04.483 --> 03:14:08.386]  Another one, mystery, why did Goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought?
[03:14:08.386 --> 03:14:12.068]  Now, let me just be clear on this, reading over these pieces.
[03:14:13.243 --> 03:14:16.884]  You have Goldman Sachs, 2006-2007.
[03:14:16.884 --> 03:14:18.425]  Everything's supposedly wonderful.
[03:14:18.425 --> 03:14:21.506]  The housing market's going to keep going up forever.
[03:14:21.506 --> 03:14:24.707]  Anyone who says that's not the case is a conspiracy theorist.
[03:14:24.707 --> 03:14:29.229]  We must give everyone a loan, even if they don't even have a job or rely on their application.
[03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:31.510]  It's the American way.
[03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:41.994]  Meanwhile, they're putting out promotions saying housing's great, these instruments we're selling are wonderful, while betting against
[03:14:42.995 --> 03:15:00.733]  Similar instruments did the Goldman Sachs massive shorting did that contribute to the overall bubble beginning to burst because because that gets into a whole nother area not only
[03:15:02.321 --> 03:15:14.062]  Are they telling people these derivatives are great while they're separately betting against them secretly, but did their shorting contribute to the bubble beginning to deflate?
[03:15:14.738 --> 03:15:15.999]  Well, a couple things, Alex.
[03:15:15.999 --> 03:15:18.241]  One, there were derivatives.
[03:15:18.241 --> 03:15:30.650]  They were sold generally offshore, but the stuff they were selling here, and even to foreign customers, but they were registering and selling them here, were bonds.
[03:15:30.650 --> 03:15:34.393]  They were good old high-yield bonds, rated AAA.
[03:15:34.393 --> 03:15:36.294]  Rated AAA.
[03:15:36.294 --> 03:15:38.276]  But yet, Goldman was hedging them.
[03:15:38.934 --> 03:15:40.735]  Secretly hedging them.
[03:15:40.735 --> 03:15:53.805]  And the second thing I just wanted to mention, when you talked about Goldman promoting the fact that the housing market was doing so well, I've seen reports that Goldman's chief economist was warning that a bubble was approaching.
[03:15:53.805 --> 03:16:03.512]  But that strikes me as also very inconsistent or odd, in that Goldman had these AAA ratings on these securities.
[03:16:03.512 --> 03:16:05.073]  Of course, they got them from ratings agencies.
[03:16:05.273 --> 03:16:07.315]  Well, they always hedge their bet.
[03:16:07.315 --> 03:16:15.721]  I mean, sure, they're out here selling them, but then they also mention, ooh, there might be a problem, you know, irrational exuberance down the road.
[03:16:15.721 --> 03:16:18.182]  So, oopsie, I told you so.
[03:16:18.182 --> 03:16:20.844]  Oh, look, all my competition's destroyed now.
[03:16:20.844 --> 03:16:22.625]  Oh, look, I'm making record profits.
[03:16:22.625 --> 03:16:28.650]  Oh, look, we're so noble, we happen to have our people all over federal regulation systems.
[03:16:28.650 --> 03:16:32.352]  Ooh, man, we're becoming the only player now.
[03:16:32.352 --> 03:16:33.854]  Gee, we sure screwed up.
[03:16:34.774 --> 03:16:39.536]  Screwed up into all this money and power!
[03:16:39.536 --> 03:16:43.678]  And you know, the thing about that, they always hedge their bets.
[03:16:43.678 --> 03:16:45.159]  These were AAA.
[03:16:45.159 --> 03:16:52.743]  And I asked Goldman Sachs, can you give me another example of AAA securities that you hedged like this?
[03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:55.411]  And they did not provide such an example.
[03:16:55.411 --> 03:16:57.613]  They said, we hedge in a lot of our markets, etc.
[03:16:57.613 --> 03:17:09.662]  But to be betting the other way, at the same time you're selling something as AAA, the question is, should they have told the investors, we also are betting that the housing market's going to turn south?
[03:17:09.662 --> 03:17:21.071]  Because there was a risk factor right in, they list the risk factors and all the prospectuses which go to investors before the, and we're talking about, by the way, pension funds, insurance companies,
[03:17:21.704 --> 03:17:22.044]  We're good.
[03:17:36.658 --> 03:17:42.242]  Peddling these things, why didn't they disclose that they were also betting the other way?
[03:17:42.242 --> 03:17:49.427]  And would the investors then still have purchased these securities if they knew that Goldman was betting that the housing market was going to turn south?
[03:17:49.427 --> 03:18:01.336]  Because one of the risk factors said, you know, it could really impact these securities if the housing market, especially in California and Florida, where things were red hot and were usually about
[03:18:02.054 --> 03:18:13.418]  Forty, forty-five percent of every bundle of securities that Goldman and others sold came from those states, or were based on mortgages that were written in those states.
[03:18:13.418 --> 03:18:29.885]  And so, what would have happened to the sales of key securities if Goldman had acknowledged to investors it disclosed in formal filings with the SEC or in the circulars they passed around on the deals they did in the Cayman Islands?
[03:18:31.238 --> 03:18:37.302]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[03:18:37.302 --> 03:18:47.529]  I have a gold sponsor, and I have the gold sponsor on the air, and I really believe gold is going to go up the last six years from 300 bucks an ounce to 1,000, and it has.
[03:18:47.529 --> 03:18:48.289]  You're a smart guy.
[03:18:51.551 --> 03:18:52.832]  So I mean, it's simple.
[03:18:52.832 --> 03:18:54.933]  I mean, I tell people, I believe this is great.
[03:18:54.933 --> 03:18:55.934]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[03:18:55.934 --> 03:18:57.615]  Nothing's a silver bullet.
[03:18:57.615 --> 03:19:00.037]  Silver and gold is as close as you get.
[03:19:00.037 --> 03:19:07.882]  But then if it came out that I was internally betting against gold to go down, which I believe is going to continue to go up for a while.
[03:19:09.867 --> 03:19:10.787]  That's a good question.
[03:19:35.418 --> 03:19:36.979]  Well, let's talk about that when we come back.
[03:19:36.979 --> 03:19:38.860]  Amazing series.
[03:19:38.860 --> 03:19:41.521]  I didn't know it was a series to show how stupid I am.
[03:19:41.521 --> 03:19:43.823]  I just read how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:19:43.823 --> 03:19:44.763]  housing crash.
[03:19:44.763 --> 03:19:49.186]  These are big, thick, meaty, documented articles.
[03:19:49.186 --> 03:19:51.027]  These are not little skinny things.
[03:19:51.027 --> 03:19:55.029]  And then he's got another accompanying series of shorter pieces.
[03:19:55.029 --> 03:19:58.270]  Just really powerful info.
[03:19:58.270 --> 03:19:59.671]  Should Goldman Sachs get in trouble?
[03:19:59.671 --> 03:20:00.712]  We'll ask him when we get back.
[03:20:01.869 --> 03:20:04.170]  If you've got mold, you've got a problem.
[03:20:04.170 --> 03:20:07.070]  But if you have Moldzyme, you have a solution.
[03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:10.231]  Everyone at one time or another will encounter mold in their homes.

[03:21:02.486 --> 03:21:06.511]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.511 --> 03:21:09.755]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.755 --> 03:21:11.157]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:11.877 --> 03:21:14.539]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:21:14.539 --> 03:21:20.923]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.923 --> 03:21:26.126]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.126 --> 03:21:36.112]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.232 --> 03:21:38.573]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.573 --> 03:21:40.153]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.153 --> 03:21:42.614]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.614 --> 03:21:44.734]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.734 --> 03:21:49.895]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.895 --> 03:21:54.897]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:22:01.098 --> 03:22:07.783]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:07.783 --> 03:22:15.889]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:24.075]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:24.075 --> 03:22:28.819]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.139 --> 03:22:34.363]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.363 --> 03:22:38.726]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:38.726 --> 03:22:39.807]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:39.807 --> 03:22:43.830]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.310 --> 03:22:49.216]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:49.216 --> 03:22:52.199]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:23:01.286 --> 03:23:05.589]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:23:05.589 --> 03:23:07.091]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:23:07.091 --> 03:23:11.454]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[03:23:11.454 --> 03:23:15.157]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:23:15.157 --> 03:23:22.963]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:23:22.963 --> 03:23:26.926]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[03:23:26.926 --> 03:23:30.489]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security
[03:23:30.689 --> 03:23:31.149]  I think so.
[03:24:05.575 --> 03:24:17.013]  Greg Gordon, investigative journalist, McClatchy, Washington Bureau, and he's broken national investigative pieces.
[03:24:18.226 --> 03:24:24.052]  The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The Detroit News, United Press International.
[03:24:24.052 --> 03:24:33.161]  He broke major stories on 9-11, EPA scandals, just so many other issues.
[03:24:33.161 --> 03:24:36.544]  And he is here with us today.
[03:24:36.544 --> 03:24:39.967]  Okay, the question that I posed when we went into break was,
[03:24:41.107 --> 03:24:44.388]  Does Goldman Sachs get in trouble for this?
[03:24:44.388 --> 03:24:56.234]  I mean, there's not even, that I know of, an investigation being done and the SEC is filled with Goldman Sachs people and I remember Paulson, it's in my film Follow the Republic,
[03:24:57.196 --> 03:25:00.457]  He's up there testifying and they say, you were at Goldman Sachs.
[03:25:00.457 --> 03:25:06.219]  How did you, Congressman Stern is asking him from Florida, how did you give your company money?
[03:25:06.219 --> 03:25:10.181]  And he goes, oh, I got a waiver from, and he said, where'd you get a waiver from?
[03:25:10.181 --> 03:25:12.882]  And he said, oh, I got a waiver from the Treasury Department.
[03:25:13.522 --> 03:25:14.442]  From himself!
[03:25:14.442 --> 03:25:16.303]  I mean, it's just, where does this go?
[03:25:16.303 --> 03:25:19.404]  Or do they just continue to get to write the rules?
[03:25:19.404 --> 03:25:36.729]  Because I interviewed a professor yesterday that you quote in your article, and he said that all of this is just continuing, that the same people that set all this up are just continuing, and so nothing's being reformed.
[03:25:40.675 --> 03:25:44.198]  You're talking about Lawrence Kotlikoff of Boston University, I believe.
[03:25:44.198 --> 03:25:45.759]  Yes.
[03:25:45.759 --> 03:25:55.465]  And there are a lot of questions about, I'm not covering the reform process because I've been doing this, but there are a lot of questions about whether the right reforms are being done.
[03:25:55.465 --> 03:26:03.671]  Congress did create a commission to investigate the crash, the causes of the crash.
[03:26:04.584 --> 03:26:16.916]  They also, we also have the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is trying very hard right now to make amends for really blowing the Bernie Madoff investigation for years.
[03:26:16.916 --> 03:26:24.402]  I mean, there just was a big Inspector General's report that came out last week that talked about at least six instances in which
[03:26:25.423 --> 03:26:37.568]  SEC investigators had right under their nose opportunities to expose this gigantic Ponzi scheme that has hurt so many people, and each time they missed it.
[03:26:37.568 --> 03:26:46.691]  They failed to take the obvious investigative step that would have exposed the whole thing, and Madoff basically kept shaking his head, saying, boy, I was lucky that time.
[03:26:46.691 --> 03:26:50.933]  So we're going to have to see whether the SEC, which right now under Mary Shapiro, it's
[03:26:51.813 --> 03:26:52.914]  We're good to go.
[03:27:21.616 --> 03:27:34.086]  In the mid-90s was a pretty small company doing some subprime mortgages, which were a little bit riskier than the traditional mortgages, and maybe had about $300 million-plus in sales.
[03:27:34.086 --> 03:27:43.654]  And a decade later, New Century's revenues approached $60 billion in one year, which is staggering.
[03:27:43.654 --> 03:27:46.576]  They were the number two behind AmeriQuest.
[03:27:46.576 --> 03:27:48.517]  And New Century had about $9
[03:27:49.984 --> 03:27:50.284]  I think so.
[03:28:01.204 --> 03:28:11.394]  And in addition, Goldman sold off New Century-related securities offshore in at least three deals.
[03:28:11.394 --> 03:28:24.906]  So, I tallied up about $5 billion-plus in mortgages from New Century, and I think the number's a bit higher, and maybe quite a bit higher, that Goldman was
[03:28:26.856 --> 03:28:33.322]  Uh, peddling, you know, after converting them into bonds or other securities.
[03:28:33.322 --> 03:28:36.826]  And New Century, I got inside New Century.
[03:28:36.826 --> 03:28:41.810]  I looked at a 550-page federal bankruptcy examiner's report.
[03:28:41.810 --> 03:28:48.136]  By the way, the only one done on any defunct mortgage company from that era.
[03:28:51.159 --> 03:29:18.032]  Networked into a bunch of former new century employees and they described how Essentially all the lids were removed from the mortgage lending process late in this You know really Red-hot housing market right as it crested that's when there weren't enough borrowers to keep up with the Wall Street demand and so the
[03:29:19.415 --> 03:29:26.116]  Lending criteria, the credit criteria just began to become... Yes.
[03:29:26.116 --> 03:29:27.657]  It disappeared into thin air.
[03:29:27.657 --> 03:29:30.497]  So this is systemic fraud from top to bottom.
[03:29:30.497 --> 03:29:41.219]  I mean that's what it's been... One of the things, I just want to mention this Alex, and that is that like other Wall Street firms, Goldman hired contractors to look over these mortgages.
[03:29:41.219 --> 03:29:42.400]  Stay there, we got a break.
[03:29:42.400 --> 03:29:43.400]  We got a break.
[03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:45.040]  Come back and explain that to us.
[03:29:45.040 --> 03:29:45.720]  Okay.
[03:29:45.720 --> 03:29:48.821]  And then we'll ask you about some other points in your series.
[03:29:51.758 --> 03:29:54.741]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.741 --> 03:30:01.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.067 --> 03:30:06.372]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.372 --> 03:30:10.896]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.896 --> 03:30:13.158]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.158 --> 03:30:14.800]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.800 --> 03:30:15.841]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.061 --> 03:30:24.484]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:01.021 --> 03:31:10.147]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:10.147 --> 03:31:13.529]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.529 --> 03:31:19.393]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:31:19.393 --> 03:31:24.176]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:31:24.176 --> 03:31:26.518]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:31:26.798 --> 03:31:27.198]  I'm good.
[03:31:45.629 --> 03:31:49.333]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[03:31:49.333 --> 03:31:51.535]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.

[03:32:01.701 --> 03:32:06.864]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:32:06.864 --> 03:32:10.386]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:32:10.386 --> 03:32:16.089]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:32:16.089 --> 03:32:18.650]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:32:18.650 --> 03:32:23.192]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:32:23.192 --> 03:32:25.914]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:32:26.374 --> 03:32:32.099]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:32:32.099 --> 03:32:34.361]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:32:34.361 --> 03:32:42.909]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:32:42.909 --> 03:32:43.910]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:32:44.290 --> 03:32:48.853]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:32:48.853 --> 03:32:53.975]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:32:53.975 --> 03:32:55.716]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:32:55.716 --> 03:32:57.937]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:32:57.937 --> 03:32:59.658]  Be well and stay well.
[03:32:59.658 --> 03:33:00.399]  Best, MZ.
[03:33:10.914 --> 03:33:19.100]  Economics professor Robert Black, one of the chief investigators of the SNL's, is laying out everything our guest is saying and even more.
[03:33:19.100 --> 03:33:27.467]  He says it's criminal, conspiracy, top to bottom, that they run all the regulators, they control the entire system, these big banks and brokerage firms.
[03:33:28.147 --> 03:33:36.078]  They're going to destroy our society if we don't stop them, and that the fraud we've seen is by an order of magnitude the greatest in history.
[03:33:36.078 --> 03:33:42.206]  Those are quotes from Fall of the Republic, the new DVD film we just released two weeks ago, or less than two weeks ago.
[03:33:42.206 --> 03:33:43.988]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:33:45.690 --> 03:34:00.940]  We have John Perkins in there, Webster Tarpley, a doctor of economics, and also a doctor of history, all agreeing with the same document, same material, and that's only 45 minutes of the two-hour, 24-minute film, covers the banking.
[03:34:00.940 --> 03:34:03.582]  So people in your friends and family, you can give them the film,
[03:34:05.836 --> 03:34:09.717]  They can really understand what's going on in this world because this affects everybody.
[03:34:09.717 --> 03:34:11.538]  Does it matter if you own a stock or a bond?
[03:34:11.538 --> 03:34:12.918]  This affects your retirement.
[03:34:12.918 --> 03:34:14.419]  It affects your taxes.
[03:34:14.419 --> 03:34:18.100]  And the same system is still there.
[03:34:18.100 --> 03:34:21.041]  The same people that ran all this are still in positions of power.
[03:34:22.162 --> 03:34:26.524]  They control both the major parties and it's just getting worse and worse.
[03:34:26.524 --> 03:34:29.125]  Greg Gordon has written three parts that I see in the series.
[03:34:29.125 --> 03:34:30.266]  There may be more.
[03:34:30.266 --> 03:34:31.747]  Hal Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:34:31.747 --> 03:34:32.847]  housing crash.
[03:34:32.847 --> 03:34:35.388]  Goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes.
[03:34:35.388 --> 03:34:35.769]  Mystery.
[03:34:35.769 --> 03:34:38.250]  Why did Goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought?
[03:34:38.250 --> 03:34:43.773]  I want to briefly, in the ten minutes or less that we have left with our guest today, go over some of that.
[03:34:43.773 --> 03:34:46.394]  We'll give you the latest on the shootings around the country, unfortunately.
[03:34:47.134 --> 03:34:49.995]  In Florida and Texas, some new developments there.
[03:34:49.995 --> 03:34:52.357]  Okay, going back to Greg Gordon.
[03:34:52.357 --> 03:34:55.218]  Greg, you were trying to say something as we went to break.
[03:34:55.218 --> 03:35:08.084]  I was just going to mention that the Wall Street firms, as you would expect them to do, hired contractors to look over pools of mortgages before they were actually purchased.
[03:35:08.084 --> 03:35:12.206]  It's very interesting what happened here.
[03:35:12.206 --> 03:35:14.267]  I've managed to find some of the people who
[03:35:15.217 --> 03:35:39.572]  We're looking over these loans, including a former project manager who would not be identified for fear it would ruin his career, who said that he watched as the number of loans that were reviewed in each pool, the percentage of loans, declined steadily from really 100% at the beginning to 10% or less at the end.
[03:35:39.572 --> 03:35:43.195]  So they weren't looking at but a small sample of the loans at the end.
[03:35:43.835 --> 03:35:48.017]  Then, you had the problem of the reviewers.
[03:35:48.017 --> 03:35:56.080]  Some of these people were very experienced, had been in the lending business for 10, 20 years, and they'd look at a loan, and they'd say, hey, this person is a landscaper making $10,000.
[03:35:56.080 --> 03:36:03.544]  This person is a hairdresser claiming $10,000 a month, and this person here is a checker at Walmart claiming $5,000 a month in income, and they're getting these big loans.
[03:36:13.388 --> 03:36:14.908]  But how do you justify this?
[03:36:14.908 --> 03:36:17.689]  We have to stop this loan because this is not legit.
[03:36:17.689 --> 03:36:22.671]  And they'd be told, no, we have to follow the guidelines of the mortgage lender.
[03:36:22.671 --> 03:36:29.293]  And this mortgage lender, this particular kind of loan, is what's known as a stated income loan.
[03:36:29.293 --> 03:36:33.334]  The stated income loan became known later on as a liar's loan.
[03:36:33.334 --> 03:36:35.614]  There was no verification of the
[03:36:40.177 --> 03:36:43.960]  So we had fraud engineered into the system, so here's the issue.
[03:36:43.960 --> 03:36:59.653]  We see Madoff go to jail, we see Ken Lay get convicted, but looking at this it seems as if their crimes are smaller, diminutive, are dwarfed by these bigger institutional hedged frauds where they all kind of
[03:37:00.413 --> 03:37:16.744]  You know, pass on the guilt to each other and then everyone just acts stupid and there's no Kingpin Madoff or Ken Lay, but in the aggregate, it's galaxies bigger and you can't get rid of these people.
[03:37:16.744 --> 03:37:18.165]  They run the system still.
[03:37:18.165 --> 03:37:21.448]  I mean, are we just drifting towards destruction?
[03:37:22.628 --> 03:37:38.502]  Well, I don't know whether we're drifting towards destruction, but it's clear that this was a chain of profit that began from a real estate agent through the appraiser, the mortgage broker, the mortgage lender, the securitizer, and the
[03:37:39.963 --> 03:37:41.224]  So they're the kingpins.
[03:37:41.224 --> 03:37:42.526]  So the buck stops with the regulators?
[03:38:02.927 --> 03:38:04.309]  We'll see.
[03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:11.958]  I'm not going to make any predictions what the regulators are going to do, not after the Madoff case.
[03:38:11.958 --> 03:38:21.810]  We'll see whether they are willing to go in there and subpoena Goldman Sachs to find out exactly what bets and what the chronology was.
[03:38:23.130 --> 03:38:33.692]  The timing of all these secret bets and what they were and what people knew, most important perhaps, probably, what did people know while they were making the secret bets?
[03:38:33.692 --> 03:38:41.854]  Did they know they were peddling toxic waste and they needed to insure themselves and that's why they bought $20 billion in insurance-like bets with AIG?
[03:38:41.854 --> 03:38:48.935]  Or was this just, as Goldman Sachs would put it, were they just repositioning their portfolio?
[03:38:52.265 --> 03:39:00.872]  It's just mind-blowing to see something like this at this magnitude going on, and no one's been brought to justice to add insult to injury.
[03:39:00.872 --> 03:39:07.517]  Record profits for Goldman Sachs, record bonuses, and it's going on at these other big firms.
[03:39:07.517 --> 03:39:16.885]  Bonuses at AIG, bonuses at JP Morgan, bonuses all around, while the real economy goes belly-up and unemployment skyrockets.
[03:39:21.417 --> 03:39:24.921]  Well, we'll have to see whether we get an investigation.
[03:39:24.921 --> 03:39:37.937]  You asked me before about what Goldman is doing now, and it is interesting and sad to note that like the other Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs, this 24-carat Wall Street firm,
[03:39:38.297 --> 03:39:54.511]  It's been reduced to going into court around the country and filing papers to seize the homes of people who borrowed on subprime mortgages and many of whom would never have been able to get these loans if Wall Street hadn't created such a big market.
[03:39:54.511 --> 03:40:02.158]  Now they're losing their homes and a lot of these people, because their credit is so filed up, will never be able to qualify to get another mortgage again.
[03:40:03.612 --> 03:40:07.275]  Well, it's a predatory vertical integration of the economy.
[03:40:07.275 --> 03:40:10.017]  Strip mining is the way I would describe it.
[03:40:10.017 --> 03:40:14.180]  But certainly, Goldman has come out better than anybody in this.
[03:40:14.180 --> 03:40:16.462]  Most of their competitors are dead and gone.
[03:40:16.462 --> 03:40:18.183]  They've made record profits.
[03:40:18.183 --> 03:40:19.765]  They've got their people everywhere.
[03:40:20.425 --> 03:40:21.326]  We're good.
[03:40:38.786 --> 03:40:39.686]  I mean, I guess that's it.
[03:40:39.686 --> 03:40:40.887]  They win.
[03:40:40.887 --> 03:40:44.909]  Let's say this, in fairness.
[03:40:44.909 --> 03:40:54.433]  Nobody's feeling terribly fair toward Goldman, wanting to be terribly fair toward Goldman Sachs because they're making so much money in this horrible climate right now, economic climate.
[03:40:54.433 --> 03:40:58.314]  But Goldman, this is not the only market Goldman was in.
[03:40:58.314 --> 03:40:59.395]  And they're very smart.
[03:40:59.395 --> 03:41:02.856]  They get the best and the brightest out of Ivy League schools and they're very smart.
[03:41:02.856 --> 03:41:04.597]  They make a lot of money in a lot of places.
[03:41:05.217 --> 03:41:13.323]  What's drawing our attention is just the fact that Goldman wasn't a small player and they got out.
[03:41:13.323 --> 03:41:18.107]  They made it out safely and nobody else really did.
[03:41:18.107 --> 03:41:19.948]  And they just so happen to have all the regulators.
[03:41:19.948 --> 03:41:21.930]  Well, amazing.
[03:41:21.930 --> 03:41:31.477]  And now they're running around, you've got an investigative report on that, one of the most aggressive groups, correct me if I'm wrong, going after people's houses.
[03:41:32.352 --> 03:41:34.473]  Well, there was a disturbing example.
[03:41:34.473 --> 03:41:50.140]  A couple named Tony and Celia Becker from San Jose had a 1,500-square-foot house, and they took a couple of mortgages out to support a jewelry business that had been hit with wildfires and other things that happened in California.
[03:41:50.881 --> 03:41:51.682]  I think so.
[03:42:06.169 --> 03:42:14.637]  And so they've discovered a clause in the mortgage that allowed them to negotiate to defer some of the loan payments.
[03:42:14.637 --> 03:42:19.121]  And they needed to negotiate with their lender to get this deferral.
[03:42:19.121 --> 03:42:21.663]  The only problem was nobody would admit to being the lender.
[03:42:22.413 --> 03:42:33.196]  Goldman had bought the mortgages from a subprime lender and denied that it owned the mortgages, which might have been technically true because they were stuck in a trust at the time, but they knew where they were.
[03:42:33.196 --> 03:42:44.160]  And this couple wrote a letter to Goldman's chairman, none other than Henry Paulson, at the time, 2003, and it took three years before sort of an obscure
[03:42:44.720 --> 03:42:50.942]  Goldman's subsidiary acknowledged at a court hearing that, yes, Goldman held their mortgage.
[03:42:50.942 --> 03:42:57.465]  And then it took another three years until just a couple months ago, they finally got a concession from Goldman.
[03:42:57.465 --> 03:43:00.366]  Goldman gave them a new mortgage at 5% interest.
[03:43:00.366 --> 03:43:07.529]  Now, this couple, it was a novel case because they had some claims, some investment loss claims against Goldman and some other Wall Street firms.
[03:43:07.529 --> 03:43:08.749]  And Goldman settled up with them.
[03:43:08.749 --> 03:43:13.111]  But the question is, how could Goldman take so long just to acknowledge that it
[03:43:14.271 --> 03:43:16.492]  Yeah, how can you?
[03:43:16.492 --> 03:43:29.297]  Well, I mean, I've got a mortgage, and over the years it's been sold, I think, five times, and then I would have them threatening me over escrow money, and I'd say, I paid that bank, and then they wouldn't say who bought it.
[03:43:29.297 --> 03:43:31.358]  Well, another company now has it.
[03:43:31.358 --> 03:43:32.778]  Send your check here.
[03:43:32.778 --> 03:43:34.419]  Send your check there.
[03:43:34.419 --> 03:43:35.920]  Make your wireless payment here.
[03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:37.600]  Make your wireless payment there.
[03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:38.521]  And then I read about
[03:43:39.508 --> 03:43:49.272]  It's been on CNN where people actually own a house, but then they say paperwork wasn't filed right, and so banks come in and start repossessing.
[03:43:49.272 --> 03:43:52.294]  I mean, this is crazy!
[03:43:52.294 --> 03:43:53.614]  It's a very common problem.
[03:43:53.614 --> 03:44:01.398]  A lot of these Wall Street firms did not always file papers with the local registrar of deeds.
[03:44:01.398 --> 03:44:05.659]  It's called an assignment of mortgage, and it makes clear who the mortgage holder is.
[03:44:05.659 --> 03:44:08.641]  And a lot of times they didn't file these papers properly.
[03:44:09.614 --> 03:44:17.276]  Many people, when they try to modify their mortgage or refinance or whatever, they run into all kinds of problems because they can't figure out, you know, the title companies.
[03:44:17.276 --> 03:44:19.977]  They want to know, who has the mortgage?
[03:44:19.977 --> 03:44:21.217]  Who are we paying off?
[03:44:21.217 --> 03:44:25.619]  Are they going to get a payoff figure if they can't even figure out who owns the mortgage?
[03:44:25.619 --> 03:44:32.561]  And it just goes on and on and on, and instead of more transparency, it looks like we're getting less.
[03:44:32.561 --> 03:44:37.342]  Well, I guess we're going to see more in this series, or are you done writing about Goldman Sachs for now?
[03:44:37.762 --> 03:44:40.223]  We got a lot of leads in response to this series.
[03:44:40.223 --> 03:44:42.683]  We'll see if any of them turn fruitful.
[03:44:42.683 --> 03:44:44.864]  I'm trying to find them.
[03:44:44.864 --> 03:44:47.784]  I'm following a number of them right now, trying to see where they go.
[03:44:47.784 --> 03:44:52.345]  We'll see if we can get up some good follow stories.
[03:44:52.345 --> 03:45:00.887]  Okay, Greg Gordon with McClatchy Newspapers, award-winning investigative journalist, and I mean award-winning, writing so many important and seminal news stories.
[03:45:00.887 --> 03:45:02.487]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:45:02.487 --> 03:45:03.868]  We've been honored.
[03:45:03.868 --> 03:45:04.408]  Same here.
[03:45:04.408 --> 03:45:05.388]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:45:05.865 --> 03:45:06.245]  Thank you.
[03:45:06.245 --> 03:45:06.645]  Take care.
[03:45:06.645 --> 03:45:07.206]  There he goes.
[03:45:07.206 --> 03:45:11.127]  I'm going to take some final calls here at the end of the show and get into the shooting news.
[03:45:11.127 --> 03:45:15.049]  They're still chasing the guy around in Florida.
[03:45:15.049 --> 03:45:15.970]  We've got his name.
[03:45:15.970 --> 03:45:17.791]  It's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[03:45:17.791 --> 03:45:20.292]  Reportedly blasted eight people.
[03:45:20.292 --> 03:45:25.694]  You've got this, which is guaranteed to be a Prozac head psychiatrist at Fort Hood.
[03:45:25.694 --> 03:45:28.796]  They're trying to spin into terrorism.
[03:45:28.796 --> 03:45:29.956]  It could be that.
[03:45:29.956 --> 03:45:31.637]  Could be a staged event.
[03:45:31.637 --> 03:45:34.018]  We'll find out later, as Bob Chapman said.
[03:45:34.018 --> 03:45:35.459]  It is too early right now.
[03:45:36.994 --> 03:45:40.496]  For me to sit here and tell you that I have any idea what's going on.
[03:45:40.496 --> 03:45:42.657]  I'll tell you this, it stinks to high heaven.
[03:45:42.657 --> 03:45:48.681]  My nose is rarely wrong.
[03:45:48.681 --> 03:45:51.462]  And it's telling me that this stinks bad.
[03:45:51.462 --> 03:45:57.586]  And if we keep seeing more shootings and they turn out to be on drugs or turn out to be army psychiatrists or
[03:45:59.318 --> 03:46:08.442]  It's just very, very suspicious right now and we are looking at that in detail.
[03:46:08.442 --> 03:46:12.384]  Meanwhile, we've got distractions in and around this story.
[03:46:12.384 --> 03:46:15.865]  The big talk on the fake conservative stations.
[03:46:15.865 --> 03:46:18.466]  They don't want to talk about the Global Carbon Tax Treaty.
[03:46:18.466 --> 03:46:19.387]  They don't want to talk about
[03:46:20.854 --> 03:46:28.801]  All the really serious issues, or how the Republicans are in bed with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and the private Federal Reserve just as much as Obama.
[03:46:28.801 --> 03:46:34.665]  No, they're all, oh we're the conservatives, we'll be back in power in the next year and a half in Congress and we'll fix it all.
[03:46:34.665 --> 03:46:36.026]  Yeah, let's see if that happens.
[03:46:36.767 --> 03:46:38.127]  When they get in.
[03:46:38.127 --> 03:46:40.868]  Just like, we'll see what happens when Obama got in.
[03:46:40.868 --> 03:46:50.252]  And then when I'm attacking the Republican Congress in a year and a half when they get control of the House, which they're probably going to do, I'll be called a commie again.
[03:46:50.252 --> 03:46:58.174]  I'm being called a right-wing extremist right now because I don't like the political whore that reads off a teleprompter who's Barack Obama.
[03:46:58.174 --> 03:47:00.135]  No, I'm a constitutionalist.
[03:47:00.135 --> 03:47:01.315]  I'm a truth teller.
[03:47:01.315 --> 03:47:06.137]  I'm somebody that just tells the truth, lets the chips fall where they may, we make a mistake, we admit it,
[03:47:07.318 --> 03:47:10.540]  We're right, we trumpet it, we're here.
[03:47:10.540 --> 03:47:17.484]  You can judge us by our track record, by the fruits of what we produce, what we create, what we do.
[03:47:17.484 --> 03:47:28.031]  But this indignation of the citizenry, getting mad, having their political angers dissipated like a steam valve on ridiculous crap.
[03:47:28.031 --> 03:47:35.216]  Obama's giving a speech yesterday, they load his teleprompter, I've gone and pulled the video up, with prepared remarks
[03:47:36.345 --> 03:47:48.052]  He reads off the, I'm not defending Obama, but I'm not gonna spend all day on some puppet and ask the listeners, what do you think of Obama not caring about the troops?
[03:47:48.052 --> 03:47:52.394]  What do you think of Obama being disrespectful to him?
[03:47:52.394 --> 03:47:54.896]  That's a mind game the media's playing with you.
[03:47:54.896 --> 03:48:02.000]  This guy gets up there, reads off a teleprompter, says, oh, our hearts go out to everybody who was hurt.
[03:48:02.995 --> 03:48:14.083]  You know, after he thanks the Congressional Medal of Honor winner and thanks the people that are there, two minutes in, he talks about the shooting as if he's the president, as if he's running anything.
[03:48:14.083 --> 03:48:19.708]  It's all about, it's Obama, and everything stops with Obama, and Obama really runs things.
[03:48:19.708 --> 03:48:26.233]  That way, in three to seven years, whenever he leaves office,
[03:48:27.551 --> 03:48:31.593]  Whether he's one term or two, it can all be blamed on him.
[03:48:31.593 --> 03:48:34.295]  And then we'll get another fake right winger.
[03:48:34.295 --> 03:48:37.276]  And then in four to eight years, it can all be blamed on him again.
[03:48:37.276 --> 03:48:39.257]  And then we'll get another Democrat.
[03:48:39.257 --> 03:48:45.701]  And then we can build them up and tear them down and make it all about how they're making the decision.
[03:48:45.701 --> 03:48:50.303]  Obama's making the decision on whether to increase troops in Afghanistan.
[03:48:50.303 --> 03:48:52.604]  They've already sent in two groups of troops.
[03:48:52.604 --> 03:48:53.345]  They've increased it.
[03:48:54.165 --> 03:48:56.046]  Right at 40,000 more.
[03:48:56.046 --> 03:48:57.626]  But they make it all about a debate.
[03:48:57.626 --> 03:48:59.107]  Will there be more after that?
[03:48:59.107 --> 03:49:01.168]  And what decision will he make?
[03:49:01.168 --> 03:49:03.029]  Will he make the right decision?
[03:49:03.029 --> 03:49:07.070]  It's just all a big theater game.
[03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:08.571]  No doubt about it.
[03:49:08.571 --> 03:49:13.913]  It means nothing.
[03:49:13.913 --> 03:49:17.955]  It means absolutely nothing.
[03:49:17.955 --> 03:49:23.417]  Did the media make a big deal about it when Obama's controllers six months ago wanted to make veterans pay for their own medical care?
[03:49:25.789 --> 03:49:27.330]  No.
[03:49:27.330 --> 03:49:29.851]  Because the establishment doesn't care about the veterans.
[03:49:29.851 --> 03:49:31.152]  They're scared of the veterans.
[03:49:31.152 --> 03:49:32.672]  They don't like you.
[03:49:32.672 --> 03:49:35.374]  They use fake patriotism to control you.
[03:49:35.374 --> 03:49:38.175]  That's why they're banning a lot of veterans from owning guns.
[03:49:38.175 --> 03:49:39.616]  Are veterans with guns dangerous?
[03:49:39.616 --> 03:49:41.117]  You bet they are.
[03:49:41.117 --> 03:49:42.457]  Some are dangerous to criminals.
[03:49:42.457 --> 03:49:44.518]  Some are dangerous to their wives and kids.
[03:49:44.518 --> 03:49:49.821]  That's just the way it is to be an empire with a bunch of trained killers coming back and living amongst us.
[03:49:50.714 --> 03:49:57.656]  You don't take my guns because a bunch of trained killers may go crazy at any minute.
[03:49:57.656 --> 03:50:06.359]  And you sure don't blame the whole military because a small percentage of them are going to go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs and fly over the cuckoo nest.
[03:50:06.359 --> 03:50:08.260]  That's why I've got my guns.
[03:50:08.260 --> 03:50:12.701]  Some crazy vet goes running around trying to shoot a bunch of people, I'm going to go out and deal with them.
[03:50:14.403 --> 03:50:16.123]  It's not because I'm macho or tough, folks.
[03:50:16.123 --> 03:50:17.504]  It's what you're supposed to do!
[03:50:17.504 --> 03:50:20.645]  I don't know how they turned this country into a bunch of cowards.
[03:50:20.645 --> 03:50:27.066]  And how it's amazing that this female cop went and shot this reported lunatic four times, didn't kill him.
[03:50:27.066 --> 03:50:28.927]  They said he killed him for six hours.
[03:50:28.927 --> 03:50:32.028]  And they're all marveling that a cop would just run in and shoot somebody.
[03:50:32.028 --> 03:50:34.268]  What do you think cops did 20, 30 years ago?
[03:50:34.268 --> 03:50:37.089]  They didn't need all the gear and all the crap.
[03:50:39.841 --> 03:50:42.942]  But a woman is now tougher than the average cop.
[03:50:42.942 --> 03:50:45.943]  And I just don't even know what to say about it anymore.
[03:50:45.943 --> 03:50:55.347]  Again, it makes my head spin that at every other major shooting, two, three, four hours, they make the cops wait while the shooter runs around killing everybody.
[03:50:55.347 --> 03:50:58.228]  I guess the feds give that order so the kill rate's higher.
[03:50:59.348 --> 03:51:00.769]  Maybe the cops aren't cowards.
[03:51:00.769 --> 03:51:01.649]  I don't know.
[03:51:01.649 --> 03:51:02.389]  Hello, friends.
[03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:05.510]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:15.693]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:51:25.396 --> 03:51:27.957]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:51:27.957 --> 03:51:33.160]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[03:51:33.160 --> 03:51:38.182]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.

[03:51:43.565 --> 03:51:44.846]  Don't take my word for it.

[03:51:58.154 --> 03:51:59.775]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:52:02.981 --> 03:52:07.023]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.023 --> 03:52:10.245]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.245 --> 03:52:15.068]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:52:15.068 --> 03:52:21.452]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.452 --> 03:52:23.673]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:52:24.193 --> 03:52:25.453]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:25.453 --> 03:52:27.074]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:52:48.759 --> 03:52:50.401]  A Fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.401 --> 03:52:59.490]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:53:01.587 --> 03:53:02.888]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:53:02.888 --> 03:53:08.470]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:53:08.470 --> 03:53:13.492]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:53:13.492 --> 03:53:19.074]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that it could even happen again.
[03:53:19.074 --> 03:53:23.756]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:53:24.298 --> 03:53:31.402]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[03:53:31.402 --> 03:53:32.522]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:32.522 --> 03:53:35.584]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:53:35.584 --> 03:53:39.226]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:53:39.226 --> 03:53:42.407]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:42.407 --> 03:53:45.409]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:53:45.409 --> 03:53:45.669]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:53:45.669 --> 03:53:45.909]  Remember,
[03:53:54.446 --> 03:53:56.947]  Alright, let's jam in a few final calls here.
[03:53:56.947 --> 03:53:57.907]  I'll be back live Sunday.
[03:54:21.408 --> 03:54:22.268]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:22.268 --> 03:54:28.951]  Central Standard Time Live.
[03:54:28.951 --> 03:54:32.092]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Texas.
[03:54:32.092 --> 03:54:33.793]  Mark, you're on the air.
[03:54:33.793 --> 03:54:34.333]  Hi, Alex.
[03:54:34.333 --> 03:54:35.794]  Longtime listener here.
[03:54:35.794 --> 03:54:41.416]  I wanted to pass on the observations at the official Countdown to Judgment Day Tea Party Tour Rally.
[03:54:41.416 --> 03:54:47.338]  After attending the Abilene Rally this morning and hearing just a few of their host speakers, it appears that the Tea Party movement's been hijacked.
[03:54:47.881 --> 03:54:53.943]  Big money Republican agents who are pushing the pro-military, pro-war agenda of the old Bush neocon regime.
[03:54:53.943 --> 03:54:55.343]  They have speakers promoting U.S.
[03:54:55.343 --> 03:55:03.886]  aggression against radical Islam terror, and the main guy running the Tea Party Tour is pushing his book, which supports the neocon fallacy of a total Islamic attack on 9-11.
[03:55:03.886 --> 03:55:12.349]  The majority of this Abilene crowd does not know your work, and if you mention 9-11 was an inside job, they spit in your face, and they spit in my face today, and consider you an Abominoid.
[03:55:13.041 --> 03:55:20.323]  I made the mistake of passing out terror storm flyers about false flag terror, but these area veterans and local Dias Air Force Base folks can't accept that the U.S.
[03:55:20.323 --> 03:55:21.964]  military has been hijacked.
[03:55:21.964 --> 03:55:29.206]  The Tea Party tour will not have speakers who expose the New World Order and that the elite insiders are behind 9-11.
[03:55:29.206 --> 03:55:34.588]  They demonized Cindy Sheehan and the Abilene crowd booed her when her name was mentioned.
[03:55:34.588 --> 03:55:36.488]  They never speak of the phrase New World Order.
[03:55:36.488 --> 03:55:38.569]  This Tea Party caravan is headed to Austin
[03:55:39.053 --> 03:55:44.758]  At five o'clock, where you're at today, you need to be there and push 9-11 truth.
[03:55:44.758 --> 03:55:45.598]  Absolutely.
[03:55:45.598 --> 03:55:49.562]  I mean, what's happened is, this is what Glenn Beck's for.
[03:55:49.562 --> 03:55:54.306]  He guides and takes the Ron Paul revolution, and he's taken it over.
[03:55:54.306 --> 03:56:02.192]  Only by Ron Paul coming out public, not attacking Beck and others, but stating the true principles, can we take control of it back.
[03:56:02.192 --> 03:56:06.255]  But, I mean, this is why the leader in power, they know how to control the left.
[03:56:06.255 --> 03:56:07.897]  Obama was meant to take control of that.
[03:56:09.022 --> 03:56:28.190]  Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, create a fake clone on the right, two wings on the same bird, and again, the mainline Tea Party people, there is no new world order, the carbon tax isn't global government, Glenn Beck a few weeks ago attacked the British Lord that came out and said global government.
[03:56:28.190 --> 03:56:29.891]  I mean, come on, Glenn!
[03:56:29.891 --> 03:56:34.993]  So see, he does that at key points, he admits things that are true, and then goes back on them.
[03:56:36.308 --> 03:56:37.869]  That's why I like Lou Dobbs a lot better.
[03:56:37.869 --> 03:56:44.331]  I mean, he doesn't go as far as Beck on some issues, but he's consistent and isn't involved in backstabbing that I've seen.
[03:56:44.331 --> 03:56:46.312]  And that's why his house is getting shot up.
[03:56:46.312 --> 03:56:47.453]  But I appreciate your call.
[03:56:48.953 --> 03:56:51.414]  Look, it's not going to matter if they take over the Tea Parties.
[03:56:51.414 --> 03:56:53.675]  People are finding out about world government.
[03:56:53.675 --> 03:56:55.436]  The economy's collapsing.
[03:56:55.436 --> 03:56:58.238]  We're there educating people about the real threat.
[03:56:58.238 --> 03:57:06.862]  The best film to give a neoconoid, who are the real Obama supporters, the Bush people just held over into Obama.
[03:57:06.862 --> 03:57:07.662]  They should love Obama.
[03:57:07.662 --> 03:57:10.304]  He's keeping all the neocons in the Defense Department.
[03:57:10.304 --> 03:57:12.004]  Give them Fall of the Republic.
[03:57:12.004 --> 03:57:13.805]  This shatters the left-right paradigm.
[03:57:13.805 --> 03:57:16.467]  They've never been exposed to this.
[03:57:16.467 --> 03:57:16.807]  They're like
[03:57:17.759 --> 03:57:22.642]  They're like blind people who've never seen, trying to describe something to them.
[03:57:22.642 --> 03:57:25.363]  They're trying to describe the way the seashore looks.
[03:57:25.363 --> 03:57:26.624]  They've never seen.
[03:57:26.624 --> 03:57:28.344]  They can't interface.
[03:57:28.344 --> 03:57:30.065]  They can't understand.
[03:57:30.065 --> 03:57:34.067]  They can't begin to even realize what we're trying to say to them.
[03:57:34.067 --> 03:57:36.689]  If you just argue with them, they think, you're a liberal!
[03:57:36.689 --> 03:57:37.889]  You're commie!
[03:57:37.889 --> 03:57:38.870]  Don't give me Mao Zedong!
[03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:42.472]  You know, they don't want to hear Bush triple the size of government.
[03:57:42.472 --> 03:57:44.353]  They want to believe the lie.
[03:57:45.305 --> 03:57:52.588]  But if you say, hey, this film exposes Obama, which it does, but it also exposes Bush and the whole agenda, watch this.
[03:57:52.588 --> 03:57:58.711]  That's why Ted's going to run some ads on national radio for the neocons, because we need to deprogram these people and the left.
[03:57:58.711 --> 03:58:09.095]  This film is meant to deprogram people in the controlled left-right paradigm who think that inside the box, you know, inside this little contained area, that's the whole world.
[03:58:09.095 --> 03:58:12.136]  We're going to go, no, look for yourself.
[03:58:12.136 --> 03:58:13.097]  It's much bigger.
[03:58:14.306 --> 03:58:16.747]  It's much more sophisticated.
[03:58:16.747 --> 03:58:22.029]  And a lot of them won't wake up now, but they'll wake up later, because this is going to get really bad.
[03:58:22.029 --> 03:58:32.992]  So again, folks, get Follow the Republic at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 or watch it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:58:38.254 --> 03:58:40.135]  Incredible job, crew, this week.
[03:58:40.135 --> 03:58:40.155]  A+.
[03:58:41.753 --> 03:58:47.419]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:47.419 --> 03:58:51.102]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:51.102 --> 03:58:54.485]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.485 --> 03:58:58.109]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.109 --> 03:59:02.693]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.693 --> 03:59:04.115]  These emergency backup systems
[03:59:04.335 --> 03:59:07.217]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:59:07.217 --> 03:59:13.342]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.342 --> 03:59:16.964]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:16.964 --> 03:59:21.768]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.768 --> 03:59:28.352]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.352 --> 03:59:30.294]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
