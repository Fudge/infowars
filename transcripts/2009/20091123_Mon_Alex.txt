[00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:03.274]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.854 --> 00:00:06.715]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.400]  We are now into our number three.
[00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.702]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:39.783]  One of the most important stories we have ever covered or reported on has been breaking over the weekend and is now an international scandal of the highest level.
[00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:55.206]  Not only is this a hugely important story to every man, woman and child on the planet, not only is it important because it will make or break the global government and could be the beginning of the end of the current globalist system,
[00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:02.780]  It is of the greatest import because it's fluid and developing right now.
[00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:19.188]  And at the beginning of a story, we info warriors, constitutionalists, patriots, libertarians, truth tellers, people of honesty, have a chance to shape the debate and defeat the mainstream media spin doctors that are trying to dominate
[00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:40.141]  The situation now here in my hand I have a little list I drew up this morning for this moment now when I covered Climategate and I want to show people watching us at PrisonPlanet.TV and for radio listeners I want to go over these points here with the document cam.
[00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:42.963]  This is Climategate.
[00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:45.409]  The emails are real.
[00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.212]  All the key UN data comes from this source that is fraudulent.
[00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:56.195]  They would not show the public their data and fought to keep it secret.
[00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:00.717]  This is scientific fraud and persecution of scientists that told the truth.
[00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:03.479]  We need a real investigation.
[00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.420]  Why all the fraud?
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.101]  What's the goals of the fraud?
[00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:11.425]  This is the equivalent of having the Death Star plans.
[00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.206]  That's only half the battle.
[00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.068]  Now we have to mount the assault on these people.
[00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:25.954]  Key reports are now posted at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, your headquarters in understanding all things world government.
[00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:36.661]  Get the clips ready again of the new EU chief admitting this is world government, global governance, and that the carbon tax, carbon
[00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:41.461]  Greenhouse Emissions Treaty of Copenhagen is the key to world government.
[00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:44.264]  We have Al Gore and others admitting it as well.
[00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:48.989]  That is coming up in this report and we will continue with your phone calls.
[00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:58.139]  Also want to add to listeners that my film Full of the Republic, that's been out for three weeks, number one film online.
[00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:00.037]  It's free.
[00:03:00.337 --> 00:03:03.099]  YouTube, Google, just Google the term, follow the Republic.
[00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:08.002]  You can watch it on a director's channel, it changed the channel on YouTube, thousands of other places.
[00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.923]  You don't even have to buy the DVD, folks.
[00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:14.465]  All I Want's the Truth for my family and my children and your family and your children.
[00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:25.191]  This details how the Ponzi scam works, how the big banks have engineered the financial collapse, how they're bringing in this world government that you'll pay your carbon taxes to directly to the private IMF.
[00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.574]  With people like Al Gore and others managing what businesses you can have, what you can do.
[00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:33.656]  You will all have a carbon credit ID card.
[00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:35.397]  In fact, I forgot to reprint that from last week.
[00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:38.599]  Just Google, citizens to be given carbon ration cards.
[00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.260]  It's all over the news, worldwide.
[00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.482]  That's going to be your national ID card.
[00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:44.823]  What you've bought, what you've sold.
[00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:47.285]  When you go above your carbon allowance, you're going to be taxed.
[00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:48.786]  Everything's going to be taxed.
[00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:51.528]  Your television sets, already law now in California.
[00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:52.288]  Okay.
[00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:53.829]  Number one, this is Climategate.
[00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:37.427]  If we don't let the media spin this and take control of this, if the alternative media points out what's really in the emails, points out the core truth of what's really happening here, and explains to people that the climate scam cult, and they call it a religion themselves, Al Gore in Newsweek, says he is the prophet, it is an earth religion.
[00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.689]  The UN knows we like religion, this is their new
[00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.051]  Gaia worship religion.
[00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:44.491]  We cover that in Fall of the Republic.
[00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:45.912]  But here he is in Newsweek.
[00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:47.613]  An eco-prophet gets real.
[00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:49.073]  The thinking man's thinking man.
[00:04:49.193 --> 00:04:50.594]  Al Gore's new plan for the planet.
[00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:51.774]  It's not his plan.
[00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:55.916]  It's the globalist plan written up in the Club of Rome documents in 1991.
[00:04:57.277 --> 00:05:05.120]  Detailed articles with their quotes bibliographed and sourced at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.121]  Let me do a brief synopsis then go back over this.
[00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:09.696]  This is ClimateGate.
[00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:10.956]  This can bring them down.
[00:05:11.617 --> 00:05:12.757]  The emails are real.
[00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:29.506]  When you read the Associated Press and all of these articles dealing with this, when you read these articles, somebody come in here and get my AP article.
[00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:30.986]  It was here all highlighted.
[00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:31.787]  I think somebody did.
[00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:33.367]  It doesn't matter.
[00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:34.068]  We'll find it in a minute.
[00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:37.490]  When you read these,
[00:05:38.496 --> 00:05:39.456]  For yourself.
[00:05:42.278 --> 00:05:46.979]  The media is trying to spin it saying they don't know if the emails are real, which is another hoax in and of itself.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.481]  The university admits they were hacked last week.
[00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:52.161]  They admit the emails are real.
[00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:52.822]  They're quoted.
[00:05:53.122 --> 00:06:01.045]  The people that are in the emails are quoted saying, well, that's what I said in the email, but it's being misrepresented or it's being taken out of context.
[00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:03.206]  So they themselves blew it.
[00:06:04.645 --> 00:06:09.749]  By coming out and saying, yeah, I wrote that, but that's not what I meant.
[00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.592]  So, they admit they were hacked, they admit they wrote it.
[00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:13.693]  Let's get that straight.
[00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:19.978]  That is absolutely, completely admitted.
[00:06:20.198 --> 00:06:21.939]  And here's a key article out of the AP.
[00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.141]  Hacker leaked email stoked climate debate.
[00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:33.429]  The headline should be, emails admit pattern of persecution by UN and top university heads against scientists that question climate data.
[00:06:36.288 --> 00:06:44.478]  There should be another headline about emails show clear pattern of fraud, scientists knew Earth was getting colder, lied and said it was getting hotter.
[00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.282]  That's what the headline should say, but it's all admitted in the article.
[00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.927]  Now, the emails are real.
[00:06:51.987 --> 00:06:53.509]  That is absolutely essential.
[00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:06.914]  Number three, I know that they are going to spin this and put out fake emails now, but we have the original WikiLeaks that are the confirmed real hacked emails, and I want to thank the hackers that did this.
[00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:07.554]  I salute you.
[00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:08.094]  You're awesome.
[00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:10.915]  This is true investigative journalism.
[00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:18.443]  Guaranteed, different groups are already doing this.
[00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:21.003]  We haven't confirmed it yet, but I know how they operate.
[00:07:21.383 --> 00:07:22.483]  I would guess it's already happened.
[00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:29.985]  They're going to put out fake emails to then try to muddy the water and discredit this, because everything is riding on this.
[00:07:30.085 --> 00:07:31.405]  World government is riding on this.
[00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:33.786]  This is the main taxing mechanism.
[00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:45.508]  We've gone from denying world government to it's now openly admitted, and the world government leaders themselves, head of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, head of the EU, all of them are admitting world government funded by the carbon tax.
[00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:59.160]  Also, this university was the nexus point out of England that got all the lies and propaganda straight with the other scientific bodies in the U.S.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.684]  Goddard Space Center, NASA, European Union, that's all admitted.
[00:08:04.642 --> 00:08:18.039]  Computer hackers have broken into a server at a well-respected climate change research center in Britain and posted hundreds of private emails and documents online, stoking debate over whether some scientists have overstated the case for man-made climate change.
[00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.340]  Boy, that's a whitewash, isn't it?
[00:08:20.242 --> 00:08:21.183]  Oh, if they've overstated.
[00:08:21.243 --> 00:08:21.944]  No, they're caught.
[00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:35.265]  The University of East Anglia in Eastern England said in a statement Saturday that the hackers had entered the server and stolen data at its climate research unit, a leading global research center on climate change.
[00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:37.467]  Yes, it's these documents that are used.
[00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.793]  The police are investigating the theft of information.
[00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:45.812]  More than a decade of correspondence between leading British and U.S.
[00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:50.780]  scientists is included about 1,000 emails and 3,000 documents posted on the sites.
[00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.583]  They don't even tell you where to get them.
[00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:53.345]  It's WikiLeaks.
[00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:56.410]  Following the security breach last week.
[00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:07.484]  Information shows scientists have overstated the case for global warming and allege the documents contain proof that some researchers have attempted to manipulate data.
[00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:08.685]  It's quotes!
[00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:13.826]  Phil Jones writes to colleagues about graphs showing climate statistics over the last millennium.
[00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:21.027]  He alludes to a technique used by a fellow scientist to hide the decline, that's a quote, in recent global temperatures.
[00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:24.628]  Some evidence appears to show a halt in the rise of global temperatures from about 1960s.
[00:09:27.287 --> 00:09:42.731]  Jones wrote in compiling new data, he said, just complete Mike Nature's trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the past 20 years and from 61 for Keith to hide the decline.
[00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:44.931]  Hide the decline!
[00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:50.773]  According to leaked email, which the author confirms was genuine.
[00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:51.433]  Let me say that again.
[00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:53.453]  Which the author confirms.
[00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.494]  The AP called him and he said, yeah, I said that.
[00:09:56.906 --> 00:10:00.027]  But there's all these headlines today about, are the emails real?
[00:10:00.387 --> 00:10:03.169]  The Washington Post won't even talk about this.
[00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:12.573]  They make it about how the climate cult scientists getting all this money and prestige out of their lives with the UN and the big banks and George Soros and Al Gore.
[00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:18.516]  Have celebrations and parties when scientists that have criticized them die.
[00:10:18.997 --> 00:10:20.858]  Or they talk about how they want to beat people up.
[00:10:21.138 --> 00:10:22.999]  The media is going with the tabloid angle.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.522]  Not how in these emails they talk about how do we set people up?
[00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:28.583]  How do we get them fired?
[00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:33.026]  How do we get with the government and block documents coming out proving we're lying?
[00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:35.007]  How do we block FOIA requests?
[00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.488]  How do we threaten
[00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:40.491]  Prestigious peer-reviewed journals not to publish findings.
[00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:42.052]  How do we do this?
[00:10:42.092 --> 00:10:43.894]  How do we get the government to pull funding?
[00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:45.615]  This is criminal!
[00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:51.539]  Racketeering, conspiracy to engage in mass fraud for monetary gain.
[00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:52.560]  Period!
[00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:58.124]  But that pales in significance to the fraud itself of lying with these numbers.
[00:10:58.164 --> 00:10:59.225]  This is off the charts.
[00:11:03.087 --> 00:11:05.829]  They use the word trick by Jones has been seized on by skeptics.
[00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.210]  Trick?
[00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:15.672]  Who say his email offers proof of collusion between scientists who distort evidence to support their assertion that human activity is influencing climate change.
[00:11:16.052 --> 00:11:18.094]  Then there's the debate about is climate change good?
[00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:18.734]  Well, it's normal.
[00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:19.495]  It goes up and down.
[00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:20.455]  The sun's cooled off.
[00:11:20.656 --> 00:11:22.257]  The entire solar system's getting cooler.
[00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:28.721]  Then there's the issue about how they lie in this mass hoax and tell everyone
[00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.701]  No scientist questions man-made global warming.
[00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:35.063]  No one questions that this is going on.
[00:11:35.763 --> 00:11:41.467]  It's a conspiracy theory to say that it may be the sun or that carbon dioxide's good.
[00:11:42.247 --> 00:11:43.188]  There's that hoax.
[00:11:43.608 --> 00:11:48.572]  This is like Hiltdown, man, where they took the jawbone of a pig and said it was the missing link.
[00:11:48.852 --> 00:11:51.213]  It took 41 years for that hoax to come out.
[00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:58.718]  We have to expose this hoax now or they're going to be able to build their world government taxation system and regulatory system through this.
[00:11:58.939 --> 00:11:59.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:07.321]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:08.702]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:12:08.742 --> 00:12:09.442]  It's very real.
[00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.683]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:12:11.783 --> 00:12:13.303]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:12:13.443 --> 00:12:17.804]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:20.125]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:26.290]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.233]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:34.016]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:36.738]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:37.478]  I think so.
[00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:02.317]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:03.277]  Spy on me?
[00:13:03.337 --> 00:13:03.618]  Yeah.
[00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:08.580]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.180]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:10.941]  Startpage?
[00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:11.421]  Yeah.
[00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:12.482]  Startpage.com.
[00:13:12.602 --> 00:13:15.403]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:13:15.563 --> 00:13:19.285]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:22.226]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:24.908]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:13:25.188 --> 00:13:26.650]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:26.990]  Right!
[00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.093]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:30.913]  Hello, folks.
[00:13:30.953 --> 00:13:31.934]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:13:32.314 --> 00:13:35.837]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:13:36.178 --> 00:13:39.801]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:44.925]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:48.028]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:50.053]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:13:50.254 --> 00:13:54.165]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:55.749]  That's StartPage.com
[00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:06.318]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:14.562]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:14.882 --> 00:14:22.727]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:27.812]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:28.153 --> 00:14:32.878]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:33.378 --> 00:14:37.223]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:37.723 --> 00:14:38.744]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:38.804 --> 00:14:42.849]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:47.673]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:50.776]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:14:51.196 --> 00:14:52.858]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:52.978 --> 00:14:53.218]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:53.258 --> 00:14:53.799]  Aerial Spring.
[00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:54.239]  Chemtrails.
[00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.220]  The Modified Atmosphere.
[00:15:10.748 --> 00:15:16.830]  Heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:20.072]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[00:15:20.632 --> 00:15:28.295]  Detoxify with Micro Plant Powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:34.558]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:38.119]  Protect your family now with Micro Plant Powder.
[00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:42.280]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.482]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long-term storage.
[00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:50.943]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:22.504]  Hitler was a environmentalist, and he believed that they needed to set up a world-aryan government to then cut off resources, use inoculations, use chemicals in the water to sterilize Africans, Asians, Latin Americans, and kill them.
[00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:33.004]  He quoted the British model of a concentration camp then adopted by the United States with the Native Americans in many of his speeches and in Mein Kampf.
[00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:37.407]  He got all his eugenics ideas from the U.S.
[00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:41.609]  and England, the Cold Springs Harbor that IBM runs today as the Human Genome Project.
[00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:46.171]  The head of the Human Genome Project had to resign two years ago for saying black people weren't humans.
[00:16:46.992 --> 00:16:50.434]  He's the Nobel Prize winner for discovering the double helix of DNA.
[00:16:52.495 --> 00:17:04.485]  So, real Nazis pose as liberals who love black people and love brown people and, uh, we want to save the third world with a global tax on the third world, the first world, the developing world.
[00:17:05.966 --> 00:17:15.113]  How are they going to sell a world dictatorship over resources to turn the resources off a State Department memorandum 200 states by Henry Kissinger in 73?
[00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:17.607]  Now declassify.
[00:17:18.448 --> 00:17:19.508]  How are they going to do that?
[00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:28.611]  They teach the kids they're bad, teach them humans are evil, teach them industrial societies are evil, and then bring in a carbon tax that shuts down industrial societies.
[00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:37.634]  Paul Watson has the article up at PrisonPlanet.com with all the quotes of Maurice Strong and Ted Turner and Jacques Cousteau and Prince Philip and the UN.
[00:17:38.234 --> 00:17:41.735]  My film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, covers it all.
[00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:45.077]  You cannot make up the horrifying magnitude of this.
[00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:48.318]  It's not just a fraud to tax you.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.343]  It's a fraud to take over your entire life.
[00:17:52.403 --> 00:18:01.474]  That's why I'm so excited that these hackers got in, got the secret emails, over 10 years, 13 years, from 1996 to 2009,
[00:18:06.517 --> 00:18:08.579]  13 years of secret documents.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.321]  Thousands of documents.
[00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:11.522]  Over a thousand emails.
[00:18:11.562 --> 00:18:12.623]  People are going through them.
[00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:16.067]  Every hour articles are coming in as people read more of the emails.
[00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:19.370]  It's just, it's absolutely devastating!
[00:18:20.351 --> 00:18:21.192]  Devastating!
[00:18:22.694 --> 00:18:26.378]  And here's the AP talking to the main scientist admitting he wrote them.
[00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:30.306]  This is real.
[00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:33.508]  Some media is trying to spin, saying, well, we can't authenticate these.
[00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:35.549]  The police admit they were stolen.
[00:18:35.869 --> 00:18:37.110]  The people in them admit it.
[00:18:40.192 --> 00:18:42.334]  The author confirmed was genuine.
[00:18:42.854 --> 00:18:45.876]  From Dr. Jones' own document.
[00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:48.478]  AP.
[00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:52.240]  Headline, Hackers Leak Email Stoked Climate Debate.
[00:18:53.441 --> 00:18:58.465]  Now, we need to have a battle plan to get the word out about this.
[00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:07.939]  That's why the most detailed, wide-reaching, every angle covered stories are being posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:09.341 --> 00:19:21.452]  That's why I've got a video going up next hour at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube that must go totally viral that I shot this morning, where in 10 minutes, succinctly, I lay all this out.
[00:19:23.683 --> 00:19:24.964]  Global warming on trial.
[00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:28.026]  Inhofe calls for investigation of UN IPCC.
[00:19:28.406 --> 00:19:29.467]  That's got to go viral.
[00:19:30.147 --> 00:19:34.390]  Call for independent inquiry into ClimateGate as global warming fraud implodes.
[00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.813]  That's the big main article that has to go totally mega viral.
[00:19:39.653 --> 00:19:52.141]  We need to call for civil suits by the scientists that these scientists with the government and the UN were calling to be persecuted, to be fired, to get in trouble, to not have their papers published, to have their funding cut.
[00:19:55.865 --> 00:20:02.321]  If we go absolutely wild with this information on a crusade against this fraud, on a jihad,
[00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:04.894]  against this fraud.
[00:20:05.074 --> 00:20:07.155]  It is over for these people.
[00:20:07.255 --> 00:20:11.896]  The key, the capstone to their world government is the global carbon tax.
[00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:27.519]  I want to play one more time Von Rumpy last Thursday being sworn in minutes after being sworn in as the new EU super president announcing global government and the structure to globally govern everyone being the Copenhagen carbon tax treaty.
[00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:28.539]  Listen.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.720]  My joint effort
[00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:34.628]  Okay.
[00:20:34.648 --> 00:20:35.628]  Global management of the world.
[00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:37.409]  Global government.
[00:20:37.449 --> 00:20:38.149]  Global governance.
[00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.383]  Now, the investigations are being launched.
[00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:14.993]  Inhofe calls for hearing into RCRUN climate change research, dealing with the emails and leaked documents.
[00:21:17.057 --> 00:21:19.038]  Okay, here's another one.
[00:21:19.098 --> 00:21:24.342]  Lord Lawson calls for public inquiry into UEA global warming data manipulation.
[00:21:24.682 --> 00:21:38.832]  Lord Lawson, who did the first investigation of climate change, has called for an independent inquiry into claims that leading climate change scientists manipulated data to strengthen the case for man-made global warming, so they could defraud everyone with the global government tax.
[00:21:41.124 --> 00:21:41.824]  This is huge.
[00:21:42.245 --> 00:21:46.648]  We'll be right back after this quick break, breaking it all down and more of your phone calls.
[00:21:46.688 --> 00:21:47.208]  Stay with us.
[00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.311]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.412]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:57.035]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.672]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:22:03.793 --> 00:22:06.534]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:22:06.674 --> 00:22:08.615]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:22:08.756 --> 00:22:10.877]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:12.518]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:22:12.658 --> 00:22:16.980]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:19.402]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:22:19.682 --> 00:22:25.503]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:22:25.703 --> 00:22:30.424]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:22:30.484 --> 00:22:33.225]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:35.945]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:43.187]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:22:43.507 --> 00:22:47.190]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.470]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.411]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:22:59.434 --> 00:23:03.656]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:03.976 --> 00:23:08.037]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:08.318 --> 00:23:13.720]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.520]  It's true.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.342]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:19.662 --> 00:23:20.223]  Number 3.
[00:23:20.503 --> 00:23:23.786]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:24.087 --> 00:23:27.811]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:28.551]  Number 4.
[00:23:28.792 --> 00:23:31.174]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:31.554 --> 00:23:34.958]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:35.238 --> 00:23:35.439]  Number 5.
[00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:39.941]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:44.923]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:23:45.203 --> 00:23:49.244]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:49.384 --> 00:23:50.945]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:55.787]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:24:00.131 --> 00:24:05.294]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:20.164]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[00:24:20.564 --> 00:24:24.187]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[00:24:24.628 --> 00:24:28.731]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:38.299]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.

[00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:46.801]  Order now and get free shipping in the United States and Canada.
[00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:50.542]  Again, that is TPR20info.com.
[00:24:50.883 --> 00:24:53.903]  Or click on the TPR20 banner on Infowars.com.
[00:24:54.103 --> 00:24:54.844]  That's TPR20info.com.
[00:25:19.099 --> 00:25:28.532]  By the end of the show, a key 10-minute video that boils it all down to a succinct 10 minutes, they're trying to upload it to YouTube right now, is going to be ready.
[00:25:28.592 --> 00:25:35.941]  And it's literally like firing an ICBM at the New World Order and their climate change cult fraud to take over our society.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.041]  In fact, I told the guys to Google the term ICBM launch and they pulled up a Russian missile launch.
[00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:52.504]  So we're going to play this just as a visual and audio analogy of how powerful these emails and secret documents are about how it's all fraud.
[00:25:52.744 --> 00:25:53.965]  They knew the earth was cooling.
[00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:56.465]  How they're persecuting people that try to tell the truth.
[00:25:56.725 --> 00:26:03.687]  I mean, they're a cult telling you that no one disagrees with them when the majority of climatologists are on record saying it's all a giant fraud.
[00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:05.988]  And that even if we were heating up, that'd be a good thing.
[00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:08.680]  Plants breathe carbon dioxide.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.361]  This is a scientific fraud like Piltdown, man.
[00:26:11.922 --> 00:26:13.863]  Play that video of the missile launch for everybody.
[00:26:13.903 --> 00:26:14.383]  Crank it up.
[00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:16.765]  Here they go.
[00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.265]  Missile launch test.
[00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:18.846]  Paul Watson.
[00:26:30.937 --> 00:26:36.259]  There's Jason Douglas getting ready to launch.
[00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:37.459]  Launching the video.
[00:26:38.219 --> 00:26:39.519]  Oh, here you go, Al Gore.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.200]  Hope you enjoy this.
[00:26:46.481 --> 00:26:47.141]  Oh yeah.
[00:26:47.681 --> 00:26:49.802]  This isn't going to feel good to these criminals.
[00:26:50.282 --> 00:26:56.024]  They're not going to like this when it comes back down out of orbit on top of their heads as the MIRV capsule pops open.
[00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.752]  Oh look, Paul Watson's writing another article, so's Kurt Nemo.
[00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:04.733]  This is a rail-launched missile.
[00:27:05.994 --> 00:27:08.796]  Oh here, you didn't like that article or that video?
[00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:14.439]  With your own internal documents about how it's all set up by one world government and one child policy?
[00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:17.921]  So you guys can control all technological development for yourselves?
[00:27:18.822 --> 00:27:21.564]  So you can have a monopoly over science and technology?
[00:27:23.005 --> 00:27:25.348]  Oh, how about criminal investigations of what you're doing?
[00:27:25.929 --> 00:27:28.072]  For persecuting scientists that didn't agree with you.
[00:27:28.893 --> 00:27:30.234]  Oh, let's see how you like this.
[00:27:30.254 --> 00:27:33.859]  Oh, they're certainly gonna enjoy this one.
[00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:37.043]  Video uploading now.
[00:27:37.063 --> 00:27:38.905]  Video uploading now.
[00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:38.965]  Oh!
[00:27:40.787 --> 00:27:41.989]  See how they enjoy this.
[00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:52.251]  Oh, it's slow at first, but it picks up steam as everybody gets the video and the articles at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and email them out to everybody.
[00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:56.092]  Here comes another InfoSalvo, another ICBM.
[00:27:56.332 --> 00:27:56.472]  Oh!
[00:27:57.352 --> 00:27:58.792]  How about a mobile launcher?
[00:27:59.113 --> 00:28:00.773]  A truck-mounted ICBM.
[00:28:01.633 --> 00:28:01.753]  Oh!
[00:28:02.613 --> 00:28:03.333]  You want more?
[00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:05.594]  Oh, you want an audit the Fed bill?
[00:28:05.654 --> 00:28:08.694]  It's passed out of committee with 311 co-sponsors.
[00:28:08.734 --> 00:28:09.754]  Sure to pass the House.
[00:28:09.794 --> 00:28:10.594]  A strong bill.
[00:28:11.075 --> 00:28:11.215]  Oh!
[00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:12.775]  That was a pretty one!
[00:28:15.376 --> 00:28:18.497]  Just keep firing weapons at them, nothing can stop us!
[00:28:22.779 --> 00:28:23.960]  Oh man, you gotta love it.
[00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:29.343]  They are certainly panicking now.
[00:28:30.403 --> 00:28:34.685]  These ICBMs are coming in, and their lying defenses won't protect them.
[00:28:35.306 --> 00:28:36.046]  Oh, another one!
[00:28:36.686 --> 00:28:37.707]  See how you like that?
[00:28:38.847 --> 00:28:39.588]  Isn't that beautiful?
[00:28:40.768 --> 00:28:43.211]  Here it comes, Al Gore!
[00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:45.533]  Another one of your lies is dead on arrival.
[00:28:46.093 --> 00:28:51.539]  Everywhere you go, you're being confronted by huge mobs of people that know the truth, that know you're a lying criminal.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.481]  Oh, another one!
[00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:58.046]  Here you go, Topol M!
[00:28:59.507 --> 00:29:03.852]  Oh, I'm sure that George Soros is going to enjoy this one.
[00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:12.267]  I'm sorry.
[00:29:12.287 --> 00:29:13.408]  I'm having a good time.
[00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:18.514]  Folks, if you don't know the magnitude of the victories we're having right now, something is wrong with you.
[00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:25.187]  All those energies where you get upset about sports and get excited when your team wins or in Austin when UT loses.
[00:29:25.267 --> 00:29:27.187]  Some people don't go to work and everyone's depressed.
[00:29:27.547 --> 00:29:28.447]  None of that matters.
[00:29:28.788 --> 00:29:34.489]  You're meant to get upset and angry about tyranny and you're supposed to get excited when you have victories against it.
[00:29:34.869 --> 00:29:39.390]  Making it fun, defeating the New World Order and exposing these smiley face criminals.
[00:29:39.651 --> 00:29:41.271]  It's what's going to bring us victory.
[00:29:43.712 --> 00:29:44.612]  Now ladies and gentlemen,
[00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:48.457]  I wanted to go over scientific fraud.
[00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:55.503]  It took 41 years to expose Piltdown Man, one of thousands of famous scientific frauds that governments and others have used.
[00:29:56.471 --> 00:30:00.112]  And we don't have 41 years to expose man-made global warming.
[00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:03.974]  We have to expose that carbon dioxide is what plants respirate off of.
[00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:07.895]  That they put off oxygen that humans and animals breathe.
[00:30:08.195 --> 00:30:09.275]  We have to expose them.
[00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:10.956]  They're taking over your counties, your cities.
[00:30:11.236 --> 00:30:22.740]  The Austin American statesman admitted a few months ago, but said it was a good thing, that a former colonel in PSYOPS, in Black Ops CIA Army, is running the local environmental group to set up carbon taxes in Austin.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.644]  These people know this is their excuse to brainwash your kids to turn them against you.
[00:30:27.844 --> 00:30:33.469]  We could play the Al Gore clip of him in an auditorium to elementary students saying, your parents are wrong.
[00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:35.110]  Man-made global warming is real.
[00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.071]  You must teach them.
[00:30:36.351 --> 00:30:37.492]  You must report on them.
[00:30:37.692 --> 00:30:39.414]  Kathleen Sebelius last week saying,
[00:30:39.654 --> 00:30:43.555]  Kids, go out and tell your parents they're wrong about the flu shot, and that they should take it.
[00:30:43.895 --> 00:30:45.536]  They're trying to take over your kids.
[00:30:45.856 --> 00:30:55.920]  You need to go to the schools, the PTAs, the county commissioners, the city councils, the state houses, and point out the internal emails of this all being a fraud to set up global government taxes.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.340]  Now here's one example.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.322]  We need articles exposing other scientific frauds, and this is not the only fraud.
[00:31:03.582 --> 00:31:05.603]  Al Gore was caught putting carbon dioxide
[00:31:06.442 --> 00:31:09.724]  In fact, Google Al Gore's carbon dioxide graph.
[00:31:10.024 --> 00:31:18.008]  It'll be photos of him on images standing in front of a big TV screen with a graph on red and green.
[00:31:18.148 --> 00:31:18.909]  And he flipped it!
[00:31:19.069 --> 00:31:21.350]  All the universities, all the governments had the real graph.
[00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:26.233]  Within a hundred years of temperatures going up, carbon dioxide goes up.
[00:31:26.853 --> 00:31:29.795]  Because it releases carbon dioxide from the water and the ice caps.
[00:31:30.035 --> 00:31:31.516]  There's more plant and animal life.
[00:31:31.816 --> 00:31:33.437]  More carbon dioxide is then put out.
[00:31:34.437 --> 00:31:35.498]  But mainly it's the oceans.
[00:31:36.482 --> 00:31:37.123]  That release it.
[00:31:38.304 --> 00:31:39.745]  And so he flipped the graphs.
[00:31:39.805 --> 00:31:42.107]  He got caught two years ago and doesn't use that graph.
[00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:45.089]  He's been caught photoshopping hurricanes that don't exist.
[00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:50.113]  He's been caught lying and saying polar bears can't swim when they're the strongest swimming land animal.
[00:31:51.014 --> 00:31:55.297]  He'll show him on an ice float hunting seal and say, oh look, it's stuck.
[00:31:55.337 --> 00:31:59.220]  He's going to drift away and die when polar bear numbers have exploded globally.
[00:32:01.022 --> 00:32:02.163]  This is all admitted.
[00:32:02.243 --> 00:32:03.544]  It's all fraud.
[00:32:03.624 --> 00:32:04.825]  It's all lies.
[00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:05.726]  There's Al Gore.
[00:32:06.874 --> 00:32:08.556]  With his fraudulent graph.
[00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:13.220]  Where he shows carbon dioxide in line with warming.
[00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:15.082]  When it actually follows it.
[00:32:15.883 --> 00:32:16.704]  And he knows that.
[00:32:17.324 --> 00:32:18.185]  He is a fraud.
[00:32:18.265 --> 00:32:19.086]  He is a criminal.
[00:32:19.506 --> 00:32:21.748]  He needs to be investigated for racketeering.
[00:32:22.089 --> 00:32:24.131]  Trying to defraud the public with a global tax.
[00:32:28.621 --> 00:32:31.206]  Now, I want to just finish with Piltdown Man.
[00:32:31.266 --> 00:32:32.769]  We'll take your calls and get more into this.
[00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:33.852]  Piltdown Man.
[00:32:33.872 --> 00:32:37.659]  The Piltdown Man is a famous paleontological hoax.
[00:32:38.703 --> 00:32:50.987]  Concerning the finding of remains of a previously unknown early human, the hoax find consisted of fragments of a skull and jawbone collected in 1912 from a gravel pit in Piltdown, Essex, England.
[00:32:51.467 --> 00:32:58.129]  The fragments were thought by many experts of the day to be the fossilized remains of a hereto unknown form of early man.
[00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:06.592]  The Latin name translates to Darwin's Dawn Man, after the collector Charles Dawson was given to the specimen.
[00:33:07.878 --> 00:33:27.171]  The significance of the specimen remained the subject of controversy until it was exposed in 1953, 41 years later as a forgery, consisting of the lower jawbone of an ancient pig that had been, a prehistoric pig, that had been deliberately combined with the skull of a fully developed modern human.
[00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:32.968]  The Piltdown Hoax is perhaps the most famous paleontological hoax in history.
[00:33:33.348 --> 00:33:35.249]  It has been prominent for two reasons.
[00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:43.592]  The attention paid to the issue of human evolution and the length of time, more than 40 years, that elapsed from its discovery to its full exposure as a forgery.
[00:33:44.593 --> 00:33:47.774]  And then it goes on to how it was a pig job.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.480]  Now, that's all this is.
[00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:57.802]  But instead of the guy going around the country making hundreds of thousands of dollars showing the fake skull, that was his reason to be engaged in fraud.
[00:33:58.342 --> 00:34:08.885]  The reason the UN and JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs want this, and the reason they're the main funders of these groups, along with George Soros, is that it allows the private IMF to levy taxes on everyone.
[00:34:10.085 --> 00:34:20.503]  And the UN and private carbon credit companies run by Al Gore and also partially owned, this is Wall Street Journal, by Barack Obama.
[00:34:21.764 --> 00:34:30.409]  You will have to buy your credits from them and they will decide what new businesses get government funding, what corporate... Al Gore said he wants to bankrupt the coal companies.
[00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.031]  Global body needs direct green technology.
[00:34:34.432 --> 00:34:39.955]  G77 says developing nations call for UN body to police battle on climate change.
[00:34:40.275 --> 00:34:43.017]  They will decide what technologies you can have.
[00:34:43.337 --> 00:34:45.478]  They will decide what is to be taxed.
[00:34:45.598 --> 00:34:46.719]  They will run your life.
[00:34:48.359 --> 00:35:00.231]  And we have the articles up there at PrisonPlanet.com right now with the quotes by the UN and Henry Kissinger and all of them about how this is meant to destroy the industrial society and vertically integrate it under their control.
[00:35:00.852 --> 00:35:04.456]  This is so important to get this out to everyone now.
[00:35:05.077 --> 00:35:09.661]  To get the articles we've written with the emails, with the documents, so people get the full picture.
[00:35:10.507 --> 00:35:24.695]  Unfortunately, hardly anybody else is putting the full picture together of why they want the fraud, the past fraud they've engaged in, the new fraud, how they were caught persecuting scientists, how they were caught in the emails colluding with government to block the real climate data from coming out.
[00:35:24.995 --> 00:35:33.340]  This is a giant criminal operation between the British, the US, the EU, the Canadian government, NASA, you name it, caught red-handed.
[00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:40.530]  Now, until we go to break, I've got a guest with us, and then we're going to come back and take calls and get into other news and flu news for the balance of the show.
[00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:48.315]  News like, batch of H1N1 vaccine recalled for severe reactions, including people getting paralyzed and dying.
[00:35:48.615 --> 00:35:49.476]  Mainstream news.
[00:35:49.516 --> 00:35:52.058]  I mean, it's all insane, and it's all coming up.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:53.574]  Of course!
[00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:13.530]  I bought food.
[00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.331]  I didn't like the other companies I bought from.
[00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:16.331]  I liked his food.
[00:36:16.511 --> 00:36:17.452]  I contacted him.
[00:36:17.832 --> 00:36:18.973]  I got him as a sponsor.
[00:36:19.233 --> 00:36:20.354]  That's why he's our sponsor.
[00:36:20.374 --> 00:36:23.896]  And with all this craziness going on, you need to be self-sufficient.
[00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:29.939]  With the depression they're setting up, the death of the dollar, all of this, you need guns, you need food, you need water filters.
[00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:34.142]  And the place to get the recently packed, a lot of people are selling 10, 15-year-old food.
[00:36:34.182 --> 00:36:35.382]  This was packed in the last month.
[00:36:36.303 --> 00:36:37.984]  Well, Steve Schenck, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:36:38.891 --> 00:36:40.271]  Hey Alex, great job.
[00:36:40.391 --> 00:36:41.892]  This is absolutely wonderful.
[00:36:41.912 --> 00:36:47.854]  This global warming garbage is something that you and I talked about way back when Obama was trying to be elected.
[00:36:48.454 --> 00:36:55.716]  And he was saying that they were dealing with cow farts and dealing with the farmers creating more... They're gonna tax...
[00:36:55.936 --> 00:36:58.897]  Cow flatulence, chicken flatulence, L.A.
[00:36:58.957 --> 00:37:01.438]  Times, your dog's flatulence is going to be taxed.
[00:37:01.858 --> 00:37:06.320]  People didn't believe Schwarzenegger was going to tax all TVs and ban above 40 inches.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.641]  He just did it without even passing a law.
[00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:09.841]  I mean, it's happening.
[00:37:10.622 --> 00:37:11.262]  Yep.
[00:37:11.322 --> 00:37:14.163]  And the interesting thing is, is it all relates to food, oddly enough.
[00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:17.703]  All of this global warming stuff, they're talking about the farmers.
[00:37:17.724 --> 00:37:20.886]  The UN says they want to shut off the food, you're right!
[00:37:20.906 --> 00:37:22.588]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:37:23.228 --> 00:37:36.439]  And you see, the beautiful thing is, is that we just came out with this new product, this new prepared food that people can put into their homes for less than what they're paying for groceries, and it beats the daylights out of anything else that they've got.
[00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:40.923]  And we just, I've got to announce this on your show, we waited to do it.
[00:37:41.443 --> 00:37:46.104]  We've just done a 10% across-the-board price reduction for three weeks.
[00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.685]  And it's on everything.
[00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:54.327]  If people get up on the website, efoodsdirect.com, they can find some fabulous, fabulous food.
[00:37:54.367 --> 00:37:58.108]  And by the way, Steve, the site was awesome before.
[00:37:58.468 --> 00:37:59.649]  It's now off the charts.
[00:37:59.749 --> 00:38:00.749]  efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:01.815 --> 00:38:02.015]  Yep.
[00:38:02.256 --> 00:38:05.360]  And the main thing is, is that people are using this food now, Alex.
[00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:07.864]  It's not a matter of just sticking it back in stores.
[00:38:07.924 --> 00:38:09.506]  You predicted that two years ago.
[00:38:09.546 --> 00:38:10.888]  They bought it when it was cheaper.
[00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:12.531]  Now inflation's going up.
[00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:13.753]  They're now living off of it.
[00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:15.001]  Absolutely.
[00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:28.424]  And the fact is, is that if people will get in touch with us, essentially the one thing that they can do, the thing that people have to have, is a base so that they can deal with all these battles that you're helping us fight.
[00:38:28.924 --> 00:38:30.604]  How many more frauds are we going to have?
[00:38:31.084 --> 00:38:39.046]  We went through the global warming, we got the swine flu, before the swine flu we had the bird flu, the mad cow disease, and all this kind of garbage, these designer viruses.
[00:38:39.722 --> 00:38:45.486]  Now we've got all sorts of things that are threatening the food supply, particularly the global warming was after it.
[00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:53.651]  A lot of the legislation that you and I have talked about to chop back the food was as a result of using this global warming as an excuse.
[00:38:55.732 --> 00:38:55.992]  Absolutely.
[00:38:56.012 --> 00:38:56.853]  Now you're blowing holes in it.
[00:38:57.653 --> 00:38:58.234]  Absolutely.
[00:38:58.254 --> 00:39:01.296]  And you've got a bunch of new specials and great packages.
[00:39:01.616 --> 00:39:06.119]  Tell folks about the incredible products at E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[00:39:07.108 --> 00:39:13.551]  Well, what they are is they're all designed to be eaten rather than just stored back.
[00:39:13.911 --> 00:39:17.373]  The main thing that this is, is it's good raw food.
[00:39:17.673 --> 00:39:20.154]  If you get the bulk packed, there are two ways to do it.
[00:39:20.495 --> 00:39:25.777]  You can pack in the bulk if you want the absolute maximum amount of food for the least number of dollars.
[00:39:25.837 --> 00:39:30.239]  If you're really tight financially and you put some sweat equity into cooking it yourself, you're great.
[00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:34.441]  The other line we just came out with, Alex, is absolutely phenomenal.
[00:39:34.461 --> 00:39:35.562]  We've got backpackers.
[00:39:36.062 --> 00:39:36.783]  We're good to go.
[00:40:01.344 --> 00:40:03.426]  Some of the contracts and things that are coming up.
[00:40:03.746 --> 00:40:07.509]  We literally have people from your show putting together food banks.
[00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:10.351]  Not food banks, but food vaults, I'm sorry.
[00:40:11.011 --> 00:40:15.635]  And we've got investor groups that are putting in food just because of the things that you've said.
[00:40:16.195 --> 00:40:20.959]  And it's just, it's taxing our production facilities, but that means we get better pricing.
[00:40:20.979 --> 00:40:22.680]  Well that's another issue.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:28.264]  Police departments, Homeland Security, corporations are hoarding food and weapons right now.
[00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:28.725]  Why?
[00:40:30.322 --> 00:40:44.878]  Well, one of the people that you can't stand, this Mr. Soros, he was in cahoots with some people that were telling everybody that gold is going to go up, gold is going up, but you know what they're telling people to invest in, what they are investing in themselves?
[00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:46.080]  Guess what?
[00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:47.161]  Food.
[00:40:48.022 --> 00:40:49.604]  Food, they're putting in big balls of it.
[00:40:50.461 --> 00:41:04.471]  So very simply, my friend, it's important to these bad guys to control the food with the global warming stuff and with the... They're getting ready for something big and people, again, have got to screw loose.
[00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:15.218]  If they don't call eFoodsDirect, if they don't go to eFoodsDirect.com, give people the toll-free number, Steve, so they can call and order food today or ask questions or get a brochure.
[00:41:15.834 --> 00:41:16.194]  Sounds good.
[00:41:16.214 --> 00:41:16.254]  800-409-5633.
[00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:16.895]  That's 800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[00:41:25.802 --> 00:41:27.443]  And the new site, the other one was great.
[00:41:27.463 --> 00:41:29.924]  It's got videos, audios, photos, documents.
[00:41:29.984 --> 00:41:33.586]  I mean, efoodsdirect.com is one of the best websites I've seen in a while.
[00:41:33.626 --> 00:41:35.207]  I'm looking at it right now on screen.
[00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:36.567]  Amazing job.
[00:41:36.607 --> 00:41:39.629]  And you've got the best food, not just the best website.
[00:41:39.769 --> 00:41:42.711]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:41:42.971 --> 00:41:45.972]  There's so many other things you've got to announce, Steve.
[00:41:45.992 --> 00:41:47.053]  We've got one minute left.
[00:41:47.353 --> 00:41:49.234]  Tell people about some of the other stuff on the site.
[00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:54.046]  Well, basically, the whole idea behind it is the two concepts.
[00:41:54.126 --> 00:42:11.160]  If you want food that's prepared, that literally, if you take into consideration everything you have to do to put this together, you have literally gourmet food that you couldn't even get at the quality of the restaurant that your nine-year-old can prepare, and people are putting this stuff in, and we've got the seven-day responders.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.144]  They can build this into weeks and months worth of food, and it's just like a savings account.
[00:42:16.564 --> 00:42:19.507]  Literally put in your own food vault, just like the bad guys are doing.
[00:42:19.967 --> 00:42:20.567]  It makes sense.
[00:42:21.608 --> 00:42:26.710]  Folks, you've got to give eFoodsDirect a call or visit eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:42:59.775 --> 00:43:00.215]  Don't wait.
[00:43:00.235 --> 00:43:01.816]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:43:01.956 --> 00:43:03.396]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:43:03.456 --> 00:43:04.556]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:43:04.797 --> 00:43:06.597]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:43:06.737 --> 00:43:15.440]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.782]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:43:20.942 --> 00:43:22.563]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:43:22.743 --> 00:43:30.145]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:05.044]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.424 --> 00:44:08.410]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.073]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:10.777 --> 00:44:13.438]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:19.659]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:24.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:25.381 --> 00:44:28.181]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:35.003]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:35.123 --> 00:44:37.245]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:37.485 --> 00:44:38.806]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:39.066 --> 00:44:41.348]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.528 --> 00:44:43.389]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:43.649 --> 00:44:48.473]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:48.813 --> 00:44:57.920]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:01.044 --> 00:45:02.345]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:45:02.685 --> 00:45:06.206]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[00:45:06.687 --> 00:45:14.050]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love and
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.282]  Fast foremost, easy to make prepared meals that taste great and a smaller than one year supply for greater affordability.
[00:45:26.502 --> 00:45:35.385]  I don't have to tell you that the troubled times and loss of freedoms that we only anticipated in 2008 have arrived in our lives with a vengeance.
[00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:44.829]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours and comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate.
[00:45:45.029 --> 00:45:46.450]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.810]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:51.152]  We here at efoodsdirect wish you peace, security, and plenty this holiday season.
[00:46:00.862 --> 00:46:05.985]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:06.685 --> 00:46:08.886]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.113]  I was almost late getting back in here because I was out there.
[00:46:37.033 --> 00:46:38.394]  I did a 12-minute video.
[00:46:38.414 --> 00:46:45.339]  I meant to keep it to 10 this morning, right before I went live, trying to boil down exactly what's happening with ClimateGate in a concise way.
[00:46:45.419 --> 00:46:47.640]  So Part 1 is 10 minutes.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.201]  Part 2 is 10 minutes.
[00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:53.664]  Part 1 has gone live on the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube.
[00:46:54.224 --> 00:46:55.245]  So guys, pull that up.
[00:46:55.265 --> 00:46:57.887]  I'm going to play that about 10 minutes into the next hour, Part 1.
[00:46:59.568 --> 00:47:00.649]  Part 2 will be up.
[00:47:00.689 --> 00:47:02.992]  We're going to link them at InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:47:03.032 --> 00:47:05.976]  They will also have links to the articles by Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo.
[00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:12.704]  We're also going to post my hour-long breakdown last night under it, if people want the full breakdown.
[00:47:13.785 --> 00:47:15.207]  It is so important.
[00:47:16.636 --> 00:47:26.699]  That you email this to TV stations, radio stations, that you give this to everyone because the media will be like, I haven't heard about this, I haven't heard about it being leaked, that the whole global warming thing's a fraud.
[00:47:27.499 --> 00:47:32.441]  And even people that are covering it aren't pointing out what the head of the UN, what the head of the EU are saying.
[00:47:32.941 --> 00:47:39.123]  Ban Ki-moon and others are admitting that this is for world government.
[00:47:40.782 --> 00:47:43.464]  I mean, this is just so amazing.
[00:47:43.544 --> 00:47:47.366]  I don't even have words to describe how off-the-charts important this is.
[00:47:47.947 --> 00:47:49.228]  New EU president.
[00:47:50.308 --> 00:47:53.290]  Rompey announces 2009 his first year of global governance.
[00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:53.851]  That's a quote.
[00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:57.213]  EU president wants Copenhagen to give us global management of planet.
[00:47:57.553 --> 00:48:00.115]  I explain it all in these two videos that are going up.
[00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:10.816]  And I haven't even gotten into the black site news, the torture news, the flu vaccine recall that's in a few newspapers, but nowhere else.
[00:48:10.856 --> 00:48:12.657]  People need to know this stuff's getting recalled.
[00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.218]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:25.063]  We're going to play this video on the radio coming up next hour, the first part of it, and take your calls.
[00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:26.444]  I'm going to go to calls right now.
[00:48:26.764 --> 00:48:28.405]  Let's talk to Chris in California.
[00:48:28.425 --> 00:48:29.266]  Chris, thanks for holding.
[00:48:29.546 --> 00:48:29.846]  Welcome.
[00:48:30.905 --> 00:48:32.587]  No problem Alex, you are awesome.
[00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:37.772]  And I just want to say, I was celebrating with you guys yesterday because this is amazing news.
[00:48:38.712 --> 00:48:42.796]  And we've got to take this goldmine of truth and use it.
[00:48:43.077 --> 00:48:47.321]  We can't just let these pearls fall before us and not use them.
[00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:49.523]  This is death to the New World Order.
[00:48:49.943 --> 00:48:55.488]  We were just given the cyanide poison to kill their lie, but we've got to pour it in now.
[00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.110]  You understand?
[00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.791]  We've got to deliver the death blow.
[00:48:59.092 --> 00:49:00.913]  And that's up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:00.973 --> 00:49:01.933]  You are the power.
[00:49:02.414 --> 00:49:03.654]  I'm not doing a great job.
[00:49:04.335 --> 00:49:07.737]  I'm somebody who doesn't like con artist scumbags trying to take over my life.
[00:49:09.078 --> 00:49:09.538]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:09.878 --> 00:49:10.719]  I'm right there with you.
[00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:15.282]  And just to tell you something, I've got to check this out because I'm a testifier along with you.
[00:49:15.642 --> 00:49:24.027]  And just to let other people know, there are other legit sites out there, like the wallstreetjournal.com, their online site, online.wsj.com.
[00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:24.928]  You can check it out today.
[00:49:25.615 --> 00:49:29.640]  Climate Emails Stoked Debate, an article by Keith Johnson.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.762]  That's Climate Emails Stoked Debate.
[00:49:32.143 --> 00:49:33.024]  You can check it out there.
[00:49:33.064 --> 00:49:34.125]  No, I have the article.
[00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:35.106]  I have the article.
[00:49:35.126 --> 00:49:35.987]  In fact, give it to me, guys.
[00:49:36.007 --> 00:49:37.188]  I'll give it to you to get gassed off of.
[00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:41.914]  As bad as it sounds, that article isn't one-tenth as bad as it really is.
[00:49:42.254 --> 00:49:45.138]  See, this is all being spun down, but go ahead.
[00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:50.884]  Sure, but they do have the emails and documents there for everybody to download as a .zip file.
[00:49:51.484 --> 00:49:59.549]  That's what's important, because they're up on InfoWars and Prison Planet, but mainline people may not believe it, but if they get it from the Wall Street Journal, they will.
[00:49:59.609 --> 00:50:00.270]  Here's the article.
[00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:01.510]  Give me a close shot.
[00:50:01.851 --> 00:50:05.873]  Climate email stoke debate, and it does have links, and we've highlighted it, as you can see.
[00:50:05.913 --> 00:50:06.253]  Go ahead.
[00:50:07.134 --> 00:50:07.474]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:08.115 --> 00:50:14.979]  So, I went ahead and scanned some notes this morning, and I had to call you because, you know, a lot of it's persuasion.
[00:50:15.794 --> 00:50:23.416]  A lot of it is about, you know, pretty much if you see Gwyneth Paltrow at a bus stop, it will help change attitudes.
[00:50:23.997 --> 00:50:26.958]  And you can also use emotions.
[00:50:27.158 --> 00:50:34.880]  Another classic marketing rule, changing behavior by disseminating information doesn't always work, but emotions and visuals always do.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.861]  You've got to let people know this is important information.
[00:50:38.961 --> 00:50:39.502]  It is.
[00:50:39.522 --> 00:50:43.483]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.055 --> 00:50:47.277]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.699 --> 00:50:57.164]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?

[00:51:16.823 --> 00:51:22.209]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:51:22.429 --> 00:51:24.249]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:51:24.509 --> 00:51:25.910]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.510]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.151]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:51:33.511 --> 00:51:36.892]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:51:37.212 --> 00:51:39.853]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:51:40.353 --> 00:51:41.773]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:44.354]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:51:52.799 --> 00:51:54.724]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.205 --> 00:51:57.972]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:07.901 --> 00:52:08.682]  Battle stations!
[00:52:08.762 --> 00:52:09.563]  Battle stations!
[00:52:09.643 --> 00:52:10.444]  Battle stations!
[00:52:10.484 --> 00:52:12.466]  This is the front lines of the Info War.
[00:52:12.586 --> 00:52:13.787]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:52:14.448 --> 00:52:20.174]  The global government, run by a bunch of made-off, kinlay scammers, has taken over the planet.
[00:52:20.234 --> 00:52:28.203]  They openly admit in their own documents that we have leaked, that we have linked, that have been leaked, that this is all a complete and total fraud.
[00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.152]  They know global warming isn't happening.
[00:52:32.192 --> 00:52:33.793]  They know global warming isn't bad.
[00:52:34.093 --> 00:52:36.715]  They want to tax every part of your life.
[00:52:36.755 --> 00:52:39.497]  That's why they chose one of the four elements of life.
[00:52:39.917 --> 00:52:42.880]  Carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, sunlight.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.022]  That's what carbon-based life forms operate on.
[00:52:46.042 --> 00:52:47.203]  This is a war.
[00:52:47.283 --> 00:52:51.105]  The carbon tax, the power to tax, is the power to destroy.
[00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:56.427]  The carbon tax empire is a war against human life.
[00:52:56.507 --> 00:52:57.707]  It's a tax on breathing.
[00:52:58.047 --> 00:52:58.527]  The U.N.
[00:52:58.587 --> 00:52:59.027]  admits this.
[00:52:59.047 --> 00:53:00.328]  We're continuing with your calls.
[00:53:00.688 --> 00:53:01.708]  Bunch of video clips.
[00:53:01.788 --> 00:53:03.489]  Bunch of other news coming up this hour.
[00:53:04.449 --> 00:53:11.172]  But we need to really recognize all the positive things that are happening right now, like the audit of the Fed now looks like a certain thing.
[00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.711]  Ron Paul joins us every four weeks.
[00:53:14.171 --> 00:53:18.032]  He pointed out to me off-air a few weeks ago, Alex, you don't even call me to get me on every four weeks.
[00:53:18.072 --> 00:53:18.672]  I'm happy to do it.
[00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:21.113]  Time to start calling Ron Paul to get him on the next two weeks.
[00:53:23.174 --> 00:53:24.194]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:53:24.274 --> 00:53:26.595]  Corey in Denver, you're on the air.
[00:53:27.395 --> 00:53:31.897]  This is a death knell to the New World Order if we use this weapon.
[00:53:32.117 --> 00:53:32.457]  Corey?
[00:53:34.198 --> 00:53:34.638]  Yeah, hi.
[00:53:34.698 --> 00:53:35.158]  How you doing?
[00:53:35.438 --> 00:53:35.798]  Hey, buddy.
[00:53:36.919 --> 00:53:37.639]  Good.
[00:53:37.679 --> 00:53:40.400]  Well, I was just hearing about your
[00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:41.930]  I don't think so.
[00:53:59.983 --> 00:54:03.784]  We all got in line for his book signing, and we went up there, all of us.
[00:54:03.844 --> 00:54:05.324]  We had our pocket cams on.
[00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:20.809]  We went up there, and pretty much, one by one, we said, you know, because we bought the book, and we were looking through it, and pretty much, for the most of it, it was pretty much spot on as far as, like, you know, helping the world and all that stuff.
[00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:28.711]  There were some good ideas about, you know, no pollution, because he always tried to get the mass media, or the mass calling of people's ideologies.
[00:54:29.215 --> 00:54:35.617]  So, uh, I looked at it and, um, actually they had a page on religion and how all the religions say you need to take care of the earth, yada yada.
[00:54:35.937 --> 00:54:42.938]  So we got up there and, uh, he said, you know, I pretty much said, you know, you're a criminal and, uh, this book is fraudulent and you're a liar.
[00:54:43.278 --> 00:54:45.079]  And he just kind of blew it off as nothing.
[00:54:45.099 --> 00:54:46.239]  Ah, good!
[00:54:46.259 --> 00:54:47.819]  Get in his face, that big maggot!
[00:54:48.099 --> 00:54:50.120]  So what did that giant Nelly demon do?
[00:54:50.962 --> 00:54:54.543]  It was definitely an awesome experience.
[00:54:54.603 --> 00:54:57.724]  He just kind of blew it off as nothing, but my friend came in after him.
[00:54:58.105 --> 00:55:01.626]  He bought it, you know, we came out as number one Al Gore fan.
[00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:10.109]  And then we turned it on, and you know, after he signed the book, my friend walked up and just walked up, read it to his face, and just tore the book in pieces.
[00:55:10.129 --> 00:55:12.830]  Because you know, he had to buy his own book.
[00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:13.010]  Yeah!
[00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.271]  And let me guess, let me guess, there's video of this?
[00:55:16.286 --> 00:55:19.571]  Oh yeah, we got pocket cams, we're actually editing it up right now.
[00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:20.512]  I'm begging you.
[00:55:20.913 --> 00:55:21.834]  I'm begging you.
[00:55:22.275 --> 00:55:22.716]  Begging.
[00:55:23.357 --> 00:55:24.739]  To send me the best quality.
[00:55:24.819 --> 00:55:26.141]  Everybody confronting Al Gore.
[00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:28.004]  I'm gonna put it in Fall of the Republic 2.
[00:55:28.665 --> 00:55:29.466]  Please.
[00:55:29.746 --> 00:55:30.588]  Please.
[00:55:30.908 --> 00:55:31.669]  Please.
[00:55:32.779 --> 00:55:34.340]  We're going to cuddle up pretty good.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.582]  We're looking at the pocket cam now footage.
[00:55:36.602 --> 00:55:38.523]  Hopefully we got something worthwhile.
[00:55:38.924 --> 00:55:45.969]  I know I got some on my handy cam, but yeah, we ended up getting escorted out by the Tattered Cover Bookstore security.
[00:55:46.149 --> 00:55:51.874]  Did Control Freak Maggot, I mean, did he start getting upset as more and more people confronted him?
[00:55:51.934 --> 00:55:54.015]  Because he knows how to put on the act that he thinks it's funny.
[00:55:54.276 --> 00:55:56.797]  He's actually scared that more and more people are coming out.
[00:55:57.018 --> 00:55:58.679]  He realizes his fraud is falling.
[00:56:00.618 --> 00:56:08.466]  Yeah, he kind of just, uh, because you know how he always gets caught in his own lies and he kind of bites his tongue and he kind of blubbers his way through it.
[00:56:08.911 --> 00:56:09.851]  So that's kind of what he did.
[00:56:09.871 --> 00:56:12.573]  He pretty much didn't really associate himself with us.
[00:56:12.613 --> 00:56:14.313]  But it was definitely an awesome experience.
[00:56:14.393 --> 00:56:26.318]  And one final thing I wanted to let you know about is, I don't know if you've looked at it, but if you Google, or not Google, but YouTube, or Google the Love Police, there's some guys out in United Kingdom who are doing it.
[00:56:26.338 --> 00:56:32.021]  His name's Charlie, and he has a great message of hope and prosperity as far as the human race goes.
[00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:32.801]  Awesome!
[00:56:32.841 --> 00:56:34.883]  There's a lot of different approaches.
[00:56:34.903 --> 00:56:35.304]  Great job!
[00:56:35.324 --> 00:56:37.606]  We'll play that video as soon as it comes out.
[00:56:37.626 --> 00:56:38.947]  Everybody's confronting this criminal.
[00:56:38.967 --> 00:56:39.367]  Good job!
[00:57:00.777 --> 00:57:04.419]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:04.779 --> 00:57:07.801]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:12.804]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:57:12.824 --> 00:57:19.087]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:57:19.228 --> 00:57:21.449]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:57:21.969 --> 00:57:22.269]  Tim Geithner?
[00:57:22.289 --> 00:57:22.710]  Bernanke?
[00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:23.571]  They're arsonists!
[00:57:23.611 --> 00:57:24.752]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:57:24.772 --> 00:57:27.014]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:57:40.888 --> 00:57:42.729]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:47.870]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:57.273]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:08.405]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:58:08.445 --> 00:58:11.586]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:58:11.806 --> 00:58:17.508]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[00:58:17.688 --> 00:58:22.170]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.811]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:58:25.091 --> 00:58:34.158]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:39.682]  He also recommends ZeoLife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[00:58:39.822 --> 00:58:41.683]  Help others and earn extra income.

[00:58:59.895 --> 00:59:02.499]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:02.899 --> 00:59:07.866]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:08.226 --> 00:59:09.989]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:10.289 --> 00:59:14.855]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:14.855 --> 00:59:15.095]  We're good.
[00:59:38.266 --> 00:59:39.247]  How much will you need?
[00:59:39.487 --> 00:59:40.108]  We don't know.
[00:59:40.408 --> 00:59:41.309]  How much do you want?
[00:59:41.489 --> 00:59:42.249]  All you can get.
[00:59:42.429 --> 00:59:43.270]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:46.292]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:46.573 --> 00:59:48.774]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:48.815 --> 00:59:49.795]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:49.815 --> 00:59:50.096]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.107 --> 01:00:07.148]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.889 --> 01:00:08.971]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.632 --> 01:00:10.453]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.213 --> 01:00:12.135]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.155 --> 01:00:16.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:21.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.626 --> 01:00:23.629]  We have known that over the last decade,
[01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:39.985]  Major institutions, colleges, research facilities, getting over 90% of their funding, taxpayer money, have been told, if they don't say the Earth's gonna flood, that everybody's gonna basically die, that they will have their funding withhold.
[01:00:41.277 --> 01:00:41.697]  Withheld.
[01:00:42.018 --> 01:00:56.809]  Now we have the internal emails from the top climatology university nexusing in from England with the United States and Europe on how to punish people, how to persecute them, how to keep their studies from coming out, how to cut their funding.
[01:00:57.149 --> 01:01:01.952]  Incredible Infowars.net story just went up by Steve Watson.
[01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:04.875]  ClimateGate, peer-reviewed system, was hijacked.
[01:01:05.535 --> 01:01:10.359]  Descending viewpoints on warming were shut out regardless of their scientific merit.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:21.809]  We need this to go mega viral, ladies and gentlemen, along with the other stories written by Paul Joseph Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:25.993]  And I'm going to give you those headlines here in just a moment.
[01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:27.154]  Also,
[01:01:28.502 --> 01:01:30.064]  I meant to only do a 10-minute video.
[01:01:30.084 --> 01:01:31.946]  I ended up doing two videos.
[01:01:32.006 --> 01:01:33.127]  It's about 12 minutes long.
[01:01:33.187 --> 01:01:33.968]  Part 1 is up.
[01:01:34.028 --> 01:01:35.089]  Part 2 is uploading now.
[01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:37.311]  We're going to play those later in the hour.
[01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:44.578]  We need this to go totally viral, this special video, where I boil it all down in about 12 minutes.
[01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:52.106]  But the other articles are Global Warming on Trial, Inhofe Calls for Investigation of UNIPCC, Climategate,
[01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:56.632]  This is so important.
[01:01:56.672 --> 01:02:01.263]  Call for independent inquiry into Climategate as global warming fraud implodes.
[01:02:02.557 --> 01:02:05.299]  That's up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:05.319 --> 01:02:09.222]  That's the most lengthy, detailed article because people are really interested in this.
[01:02:09.522 --> 01:02:13.805]  This is the number one, according to Google, internet search right now, is climate gate.
[01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:15.206]  People want to know.
[01:02:15.687 --> 01:02:18.889]  Get it out to local radio, local TV, your school council.
[01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:28.056]  Everyone must know that when they're brainwashing your kids, telling them everybody's going to die if you don't accept global government, that it is a giant, stinking fraud.
[01:02:30.305 --> 01:02:31.625]  This is so important.
[01:02:31.645 --> 01:02:40.168]  Dr. Tim Ball is going to be on the radio show tomorrow to break down the significance of the hacked documents.
[01:02:42.028 --> 01:02:45.269]  The Church of Climentology is being exposed.
[01:02:45.569 --> 01:02:49.130]  We've got a great Dease illustration
[01:02:50.342 --> 01:02:51.763]  Hi, how are you doing Alex?
[01:03:10.421 --> 01:03:14.302]  Man, I'm really excited if we use this information against them.
[01:03:14.682 --> 01:03:17.523]  I mean, they are caught red-handed, but they're trying to act like it's no big deal.
[01:03:17.783 --> 01:03:21.004]  If we respond with this info and go viral, it's over.
[01:03:21.405 --> 01:03:26.486]  This is total, inside, proof of corruption, proof of racketeering.
[01:03:26.686 --> 01:03:27.767]  This will destroy them.
[01:03:28.807 --> 01:03:29.787]  Indeed, indeed.
[01:03:29.827 --> 01:03:33.608]  I just shipped the link out on Facebook.
[01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:38.330]  Now, you say on the climate change, have you actually read the Copenhagen Treaty?
[01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:46.177]  Yes, we have the Copenhagen Treaty here, calling for global governance, global taxes, global regulatory body.
[01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:47.479]  We've covered it many times.
[01:03:47.935 --> 01:03:55.637]  Now, through what I've read, my understanding of it, the way it looks to me as a constitution for global government, the way it looks... No, no, they admit!
[01:03:55.717 --> 01:03:59.398]  They say it is the constitution for world government.
[01:03:59.738 --> 01:04:05.120]  Once a nation votes to get in, they can't get out unless a unanimous vote of the nations lets you out.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.101]  It gives them the UN total control with a private IMF that you pay your taxes to.
[01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:10.861]  It's all in there.
[01:04:11.522 --> 01:04:16.583]  Of course, they won't allow that to happen because they need all the nations on board to maintain a global government.
[01:04:18.393 --> 01:04:25.595]  I spread the word throughout to a couple of my friends who actually turned me on to InfoWars and Prison Planet a couple months ago.
[01:04:25.615 --> 01:04:26.936]  I enjoy all your videos.
[01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:28.436]  They're very eye-opening.
[01:04:28.476 --> 01:04:36.379]  I like to think I was open to all this stuff before until I was turned on to you and all the information you've released.
[01:04:36.559 --> 01:04:40.220]  I mean, I'm in awe at what's going on underneath my eyes right now.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.501]  Having all my rights stripped from me and everything.
[01:04:42.561 --> 01:04:43.441]  It's bogus.
[01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:45.272]  John, God bless you.
[01:04:45.292 --> 01:04:45.954]  Spread the word.
[01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.499]  That's why I get so excited.
[01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:49.625]  I mean, I know what...
[01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:51.296]  The cost is.
[01:04:51.476 --> 01:04:52.957]  I know the landscape.
[01:04:53.137 --> 01:04:55.819]  I understand just how serious this is.
[01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:59.061]  This isn't just some good old boy corruption we're dealing with.
[01:04:59.081 --> 01:04:59.801]  That's bad enough.
[01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:17.393]  This is scientific dictatorship set up with a pyramidal power structure by the New World Order openly admitting a declaration of world tyranny, a war against humanity in their Club of Rome documents, in their UN documents.
[01:05:17.433 --> 01:05:20.255]  Paul Watson has them all linked in the story he wrote.
[01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:23.636]  I mean, it is so important.
[01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:29.599]  And I almost wish Paul and Kurt and Steve would have given even more bombshell-type headlines, like, shocker!
[01:05:30.219 --> 01:05:33.120]  Because the media is just trying to backpedal this like it's no big deal.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.821]  Okay, they talked about persecuting scientists that didn't agree.
[01:05:36.321 --> 01:05:40.883]  Oh, they talked about how to fake data to say the world was getting warmer when they knew it was getting colder.
[01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:41.844]  Eh, what's the big deal?
[01:05:42.944 --> 01:05:44.085]  This is huge!
[01:05:45.945 --> 01:05:46.766]  And I knew it would be.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.340]  I mean, look at this.
[01:05:50.101 --> 01:05:50.881]  London Telegraph.
[01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:52.522]  And the same thing's now happening in the U.S.
[01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:56.164]  Everyone in Britain could be given personal carbon allowance.
[01:05:56.665 --> 01:06:00.747]  Everyone in Britain would be given an annual carbon ration and be penalized if they use too much fuel.
[01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:03.189]  The head of the environmental agency will say.
[01:06:04.008 --> 01:06:11.316]  Well, two years ago, I had one of the top scientists over there who came up with the idea for the carbon tax, and they said that this would be worldwide.
[01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:12.037]  The U.N.
[01:06:12.077 --> 01:06:12.998]  is openly saying this.
[01:06:13.058 --> 01:06:13.959]  This is the plan.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.024]  Oregon, Washington State, California are trying to pass these.
[01:06:18.064 --> 01:06:19.405]  It'll track everything you do.
[01:06:19.906 --> 01:06:22.749]  The National Health ID card in the U.S.
[01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:24.911]  is going to be used, and you're going to swipe that card
[01:06:25.512 --> 01:06:25.813]  to see
[01:06:41.684 --> 01:06:49.647]  Admits they came up with this as a plan to smother all competition, to shut down selectively whoever they want, to tax industry out of existence.
[01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:53.028]  They will decide what science systems you can have.
[01:06:53.488 --> 01:06:55.569]  They will decide what you can build.
[01:06:55.909 --> 01:07:01.711]  They will decide through a global body who gets to have factories, who gets to have new technologies.
[01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:02.912]  Global body.
[01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:05.630]  Needs to direct green technology.
[01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:14.059]  G77 says developed nations call for UN body to police battle on climate change as if the nations know the corrupt G20 that controls them did.
[01:07:15.641 --> 01:07:21.668]  A green technology body with powers to direct a worldwide transition away from a high carbon economy.
[01:07:22.128 --> 01:07:23.850]  Powers to direct.
[01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.092]  is needed to combat climate change.
[01:07:26.352 --> 01:07:31.700]  Well, what do you think the IPCC, what do you think the UN Convention on Climate Change does?
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.121]  Read it!
[01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:33.943]  In fact, I cleaned the desk off.
[01:07:33.963 --> 01:07:34.764]  You clean the desk off.
[01:07:35.836 --> 01:07:40.057]  Last week, and I think that's out there in the boxes, the whole highlighted thing.
[01:07:41.317 --> 01:07:43.077]  There's so much corruption, I can't even cover it all.
[01:07:43.337 --> 01:07:56.460]  According to the World's Developing Nations, while most negotiations ahead of the UN's Climate Summit in Copenhagen next month have been concerned with which nations should slash greenhouse gas emissions and by how much, the method in which these cuts will be achieved has received far less attention.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:02.321]  Yet, the importance of green technology, from wind turbines to electric cars to zero-carbon buildings, is enormous.
[01:08:02.341 --> 01:08:03.881]  See, they make it sound good.
[01:08:04.321 --> 01:08:05.822]  Like it's all these great technologies.
[01:08:05.902 --> 01:08:06.082]  No.
[01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.622]  It's an iron fisted control over everything.
[01:08:08.903 --> 01:08:13.724]  You think you're losing your jobs now or getting your pay cut with the economy shutting down.
[01:08:13.784 --> 01:08:15.085]  The bankers engineered that.
[01:08:15.345 --> 01:08:17.065]  The same banks are behind this system.
[01:08:17.105 --> 01:08:17.705]  They wrote it.
[01:08:18.726 --> 01:08:22.147]  They want to destroy the economy because they create the fiat currency.
[01:08:22.167 --> 01:08:23.427]  They want to buy it all up.
[01:08:23.747 --> 01:08:25.088]  Don't you understand?
[01:08:26.249 --> 01:08:28.310]  Life is going to be living hell under this!
[01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:30.131]  And we've got a chance to beat it!
[01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:32.993]  We have their internal emails, they're a pack of criminals!
[01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:34.634]  Al Gore and all of them!
[01:08:36.095 --> 01:08:36.395]  Whoo!
[01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:38.996]  Helen in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:08:39.016 --> 01:08:43.039]  Hi Alex, it's a true pleasure to get to speak with you.
[01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:46.080]  I've been listening for a while, first time caller.
[01:08:46.801 --> 01:08:53.125]  Listen, I'm calling in behalf of someone that I know would love to be breaking this news with you.
[01:08:53.725 --> 01:08:55.406]  He has a local radio station.
[01:08:56.218 --> 01:09:05.503]  As a matter of fact, he follows you, and when people call into the station and complain about the Power Hour and Alex Jones, they include his show, The Voice of Truth.
[01:09:06.484 --> 01:09:10.586]  Okay, we're on three affiliates in Tennessee.
[01:09:11.086 --> 01:09:12.507]  Which affiliate is it?
[01:09:13.207 --> 01:09:14.188]  The one in Millington, 1380.
[01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:17.049]  Oh, that's WBCR?
[01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:20.631]  No, WLMK, I think it is.
[01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:21.792]  WLMK, I apologize.
[01:09:23.263 --> 01:09:24.644]  I know, and I don't know the number.
[01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:33.067]  But this man, he is a true patriot, willing to stick his neck out to help restore our liberties and wake up the people.
[01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:37.229]  He's the only local radio host that tells all truths in education.
[01:09:37.389 --> 01:09:39.870]  Give us the frequency again, and when his show's on.
[01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:52.636]  Well, it's on at 1380 AM, and it comes on at 3 o'clock immediately following you, but he is in court, not able to, I don't know if they'll do a rebroadcast today or what,
[01:09:53.345 --> 01:09:56.648]  He's in court, being railroaded by the Good Ol' Boy Network.
[01:09:57.109 --> 01:10:04.336]  His family's under attack, probably due to the fact that he ran for county executive.
[01:10:05.017 --> 01:10:07.019]  They rigged the votes.
[01:10:07.039 --> 01:10:14.106]  He was challenging the Tipton County General Election for fraud.
[01:10:14.346 --> 01:10:16.689]  Almost everyone connected with this court case is
[01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:22.002]  No, Tennessee's got a lot of great people, but it's famous for boss hogs.
[01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:25.905]  They've even had towns have to revolt against the government before and remove them.
[01:10:26.185 --> 01:10:27.646]  So what are they trumping up on him?
[01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:35.872]  Well, everyone connected with this case just about is related to that case of challenging the fraud.
[01:10:36.512 --> 01:10:38.494]  Okay, he has had two dogs killed.
[01:10:38.554 --> 01:10:45.459]  The last one he got arrested for, even though they killed his dog, shot at him and shot towards his wife and him.
[01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.991]  Well, what's his name?
[01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:51.578]  And the people, the guy that did it, got absolutely no charges.
[01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:54.061]  I mean, it's crazy, upside down, wrong side out.
[01:10:54.401 --> 01:10:56.805]  Well, that's how the mafia works, but what's his name?
[01:10:57.537 --> 01:10:59.079]  His name is Mike Parsons.
[01:10:59.559 --> 01:11:01.241]  I have sent you emails about this.
[01:11:16.457 --> 01:11:19.440]  And I want to thank that radio station for carrying the show.
[01:11:19.941 --> 01:11:24.725]  And I want to tell everybody then to certainly check into this and try to support this fellow.
[01:11:24.766 --> 01:11:29.470]  And to those that call in complaining about my show afterwards, they ought to call into this show.
[01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:30.892]  What are they complaining about?
[01:11:30.932 --> 01:11:32.814]  That we were right about everything?
[01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:33.775]  Are they calling in?
[01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:36.407]  They just don't like the job.
[01:11:36.447 --> 01:11:37.648]  They don't want to see the poultry.
[01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:40.349]  Well, hey, that's why they're going to lose their dollar.
[01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.109]  That's why they're going to lose their country.
[01:11:42.409 --> 01:11:43.750]  That's why they're going to lose everything.
[01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:46.491]  Because they want to be slaves, and I feel sorry for them.
[01:11:46.691 --> 01:11:53.893]  But the good news is, most of the American people are waking up, and people should support that affiliate and their local sponsors.
[01:11:54.193 --> 01:11:54.954]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:11:54.974 --> 01:11:56.134]  Appreciate your call, Helen.
[01:11:56.474 --> 01:11:58.335]  John, Mike, Tony, and others, stay with us.
[01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:02.108]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[01:12:02.468 --> 01:12:05.749]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[01:12:06.269 --> 01:12:10.490]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:16.152]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[01:12:16.812 --> 01:12:19.252]  Patriotfood.com.
[01:12:19.272 --> 01:12:23.694]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:29.095]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[01:12:30.115 --> 01:12:35.979]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[01:12:35.999 --> 01:12:40.101]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:46.385]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[01:12:46.926 --> 01:12:50.748]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:55.031]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:58.113]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[01:13:00.555 --> 01:13:04.219]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:07.582]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.822 --> 01:13:12.607]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.627 --> 01:13:18.873]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:19.033 --> 01:13:21.276]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:13:21.776 --> 01:13:22.076]  Tim Geithner?
[01:13:22.096 --> 01:13:22.516]  Bernanke?
[01:13:22.617 --> 01:13:23.377]  They're arsonists!
[01:13:23.397 --> 01:13:24.558]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:24.578 --> 01:13:26.799]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.686 --> 01:13:42.529]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.829 --> 01:13:47.675]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:13:47.976 --> 01:13:57.088]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:00.888 --> 01:14:01.929]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:07.816]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:14:08.396 --> 01:14:08.897]  That's right.
[01:14:09.217 --> 01:14:11.500]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:18.988]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:14:19.528 --> 01:14:27.215]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:14:27.675 --> 01:14:32.519]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.203]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:38.965 --> 01:14:43.069]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:14:43.469 --> 01:14:43.709]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.651]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:46.051]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:46.332 --> 01:14:46.612]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:16:03.672 --> 01:16:13.118]  I'm going to play some of these video audio clips where I really break down what's happening with the global carbon tax takeover and these secret documents that have been leaked, been hacked.
[01:16:13.258 --> 01:16:16.120]  Then I'm going to blitz through a bunch of news I haven't hit yet.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.022]  Right now, let's go to John in West Virginia.
[01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:19.902]  John, you're on the air.
[01:16:19.922 --> 01:16:21.944]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:16:22.664 --> 01:16:22.964]  Man.
[01:16:23.004 --> 01:16:23.505]  Great news.
[01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:27.109]  Yeah, we've got a huge opportunity here to really, really expose these people.
[01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:31.912]  So now, will we be able to download this so we can make copies?
[01:16:31.952 --> 01:16:35.355]  Because I mean, I know school teachers and, you know, and doctors.
[01:16:35.635 --> 01:16:44.761]  Yes, we will post for PrisonPlanet.TV members a higher quality full 12-minute video of this so you can DivX, burn it to disk, and give it to everybody.
[01:16:45.962 --> 01:16:46.562]  Okay, thank you.
[01:16:46.762 --> 01:16:53.247]  And see, I live in coal country, and you can see I'm destroying jobs left and right because the company that I work for
[01:16:53.948 --> 01:16:58.689]  We take care of a lot of the clothes and the manufacturing, some of the stuff that they use.
[01:16:58.709 --> 01:17:01.090]  I mean, they're laying off left and right.
[01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:09.513]  And then in the headlines, they put, you know, Governor for Save Cole, Ray Hall, you know.
[01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:14.074]  We've got the biggest eugenics for our senator in the world.
[01:17:14.554 --> 01:17:17.135]  Have you heard Jay Rockefeller is the kingpin of it all?
[01:17:17.715 --> 01:17:19.676]  In the U.S., he's now taking over for David.
[01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:24.412]  Have you heard the Obama speeches where he promises to bankrupt coal?
[01:17:26.173 --> 01:17:27.574]  No, I haven't seen those.
[01:17:27.654 --> 01:17:28.475]  Are they on YouTube?
[01:17:28.535 --> 01:17:33.399]  Can we... Yeah, just Google Obama says that he promises to bankrupt coal.
[01:17:33.439 --> 01:17:38.162]  He's given a bunch of speeches where they say they're going to have a 50% tax on all coal.
[01:17:39.343 --> 01:17:40.884]  51% of the energy in the U.S.
[01:17:40.904 --> 01:17:43.986]  for factories, homes, businesses, comes from coal.
[01:17:44.989 --> 01:17:52.053]  And Bill Clinton blocked one mine that had enough to run the country for over 100 years in Utah.
[01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:54.194]  They don't want the clean burning coal either.
[01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:59.357]  The oil companies want to shut down the coal companies because the coal companies aren't owned by a monopoly.
[01:18:01.338 --> 01:18:04.159]  Yeah, it's getting pretty thin here.
[01:18:04.219 --> 01:18:13.885]  I mean, in my town, back when I graduated 22 years ago, there were over 85,000 people in my town and now it's less than 50.
[01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:19.185]  America is being de-industrialized by design, John.
[01:18:19.205 --> 01:18:20.146]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:20.186 --> 01:18:21.407]  It's all being done by design.
[01:18:21.727 --> 01:18:23.088]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[01:18:23.128 --> 01:18:23.528]  Go ahead.
[01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:25.210]  Hello?
[01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:25.990]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:39.301]  Yes, Alex, I listened to your show and I've seen the Obama deception and I just saw the falling of the Republic.
[01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:42.283]  I want to thank you for all your work.
[01:18:42.323 --> 01:18:43.024]  It's very important.
[01:18:43.084 --> 01:18:44.425]  I just have a couple of questions for you.
[01:18:45.194 --> 01:18:45.354]  Sure.
[01:18:56.301 --> 01:19:03.206]  With the war they have against the dollar, what's going to happen to our dollars if they go to an Amaro?
[01:19:04.006 --> 01:19:07.128]  Well, they're not going to probably go to an Amaro.
[01:19:07.448 --> 01:19:07.829]  The U.N.
[01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:08.989]  has talked about an Amaro.
[01:19:09.029 --> 01:19:10.310]  They've talked about a Global Phoenix.
[01:19:10.991 --> 01:19:17.875]  Instead, they're bypassing all that to SDRs, in-between central banks, where they'll have their own digital currency above us.
[01:19:18.476 --> 01:19:21.417]  Then they will set, through the new IMF Superbank,
[01:19:22.438 --> 01:19:29.550]  Carbon credit taxes, derivatives, money wire transfers, other taxes on energy.
[01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:32.938]  And so you will still have dollars.
[01:19:32.978 --> 01:19:34.559]  They will just be devalued.
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.143]  And other currencies are to be devalued because of global inflation.
[01:19:40.184 --> 01:19:41.805]  It's a hidden tax on the people.
[01:19:42.286 --> 01:19:46.589]  And then you're going to biometrically thumbprint and face scan even when you pay with cash.
[01:19:46.969 --> 01:19:52.294]  And you're going to have to swipe your national ID card as part of the sales tax and the carbon tax.
[01:19:52.514 --> 01:19:56.637]  So it's going to go to a carbon-based backed global tax.
[01:19:57.728 --> 01:19:57.968]  Wow, wow.
[01:19:57.988 --> 01:20:02.971]  My other questions are just, you know, I just saw your video and some errors written on YouTube.
[01:20:02.991 --> 01:20:05.092]  Now we know about this, like, what can we do?
[01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:41.496]  You stop it by calling talk radio, you stop it by doing access shows, by going to City Council, by calling Congress, by going, look, here's their internal emails, taking the great articles we've written that have all the links and documentation, printing them off, emailing them.
[01:20:42.136 --> 01:20:52.139]  First, we've got to create a huge buzz so everybody learns about the fraud and understands this isn't about environmentalism, it's about hijacking economies for a select group of corporations.
[01:20:52.819 --> 01:20:55.040]  To be able to shut down all their competition.
[01:20:56.021 --> 01:21:13.589]  Okay, so first we've got to get the truth out that they admit these emails are real, that the internal people running this know it's a fraud, that they persecuted scientists that have told the truth, so we can defeat the Copenhagen Treaty, defeat the Global Greenhouse Treaty in the Senate, defeat the bill in the Senate that's passed the House.
[01:21:14.529 --> 01:21:18.491]  I just further discredit the system so that it's unable to pass all these laws.
[01:21:18.531 --> 01:21:23.053]  Then at the state level, the globalists are coming in and passing greenhouse gas tax laws.
[01:21:23.414 --> 01:21:25.975]  You've got to go into the schools where they're brainwashing the kids.
[01:21:26.395 --> 01:21:28.616]  You've got to make the schools stop teaching these lies.
[01:21:28.936 --> 01:21:30.877]  We have to get up, get angry, and say no.
[01:21:30.897 --> 01:21:31.738]  I appreciate your call.
[01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:38.880]  As for the dollar dying, I don't think the public realizes all we have left is that fiat currency.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:44.301]  As it gets devalued, that's going to create massive inflation on top of the depression.
[01:21:44.641 --> 01:21:48.923]  So we're going to have a depression with inflation on top of it that's as bad as it gets.
[01:21:50.363 --> 01:21:51.303]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.763 --> 01:21:53.384]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.985]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.485 --> 01:22:06.330]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:07.710]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:08.411]  It's very real.
[01:22:08.551 --> 01:22:12.293]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:22:12.454 --> 01:22:16.796]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:23:58.996 --> 01:24:04.162]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:24:04.302 --> 01:24:06.264]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:24:06.384 --> 01:24:08.667]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:24:08.827 --> 01:24:10.689]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:12.471]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:24:12.732 --> 01:24:13.773]  There is a solution.
[01:24:13.993 --> 01:24:22.035]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:24:22.415 --> 01:24:29.477]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:24:29.878 --> 01:24:35.539]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[01:24:35.919 --> 01:24:41.501]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:24:41.681 --> 01:24:42.181]  Battle Stations!
[01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:42.721]  Battle Stations!
[01:24:42.741 --> 01:24:43.402]  Battle Stations!
[01:24:43.442 --> 01:24:44.502]  Fellow Info Warriors!
[01:25:11.792 --> 01:25:19.862]  Key secret documents have been hacked by wonderful pro-liberty, pro-truth spies for freedom.
[01:25:20.925 --> 01:25:49.750]  We must use this information to go out and educate the public that the man-made climate change hoax is over and show them the UN Maury Strong and State Department Memorandum 200 documents and the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 and the 2002 Rio de Janeiro Charter with Maury Strong saying they're going to shut down all our industry after they bankrupt us with the banks, how they would then bring in carbon taxes to shut everything down.
[01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:55.536]  Then when you become destitute, the CPS will take your children and raise them in huge dormitories.
[01:25:55.877 --> 01:25:57.319]  This is already beginning in the U.S.
[01:25:57.459 --> 01:25:58.040]  and England.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.842]  It is so diabolical.
[01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:01.243]  So hellish.
[01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:16.138]  Top eugenicists are behind the global warming movement to list carbon dioxide that plants breathe and humans exhale as a toxic waste in the words of the Club of Rome 1991 to wage war against humanity.
[01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:20.141]  To have the state wage war to remove at least 80% of the population.
[01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:22.963]  The biological diversity assessment is only the beginning.
[01:26:23.383 --> 01:26:25.044]  The Georgia Guidestones are only the beginning.
[01:26:25.364 --> 01:26:29.307]  We have eco-science written by the White House science czar John P. Holdren.
[01:26:30.489 --> 01:26:33.912]  How they're putting poison in the water supply to sterilize you and give you cancer.
[01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:35.973]  How they're poisoning you to the vaccines.
[01:26:36.534 --> 01:26:37.774]  We are under attack.
[01:26:37.835 --> 01:26:38.855]  We are under attack.
[01:26:38.895 --> 01:26:40.056]  These people are not liberals.
[01:26:40.356 --> 01:26:41.397]  They're not conservatives.
[01:26:41.637 --> 01:26:45.240]  They are scientific dictators who want the future for themselves.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.481]  You are under attack.
[01:26:47.522 --> 01:26:50.884]  Now, there's two videos and put them up on screen.
[01:26:50.904 --> 01:26:52.806]  I want to give people the headline on this video.
[01:26:53.817 --> 01:27:01.679]  There are two videos going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:06.121]  They're being posted in all the major articles we've written today.
[01:27:06.141 --> 01:27:11.082]  When we're done playing these videos, I'm going to cover some other key news and take a few calls.
[01:27:12.123 --> 01:27:18.945]  And I am asking everyone to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:18.965 --> 01:27:20.125]  These are going up right now.
[01:27:21.265 --> 01:27:22.466]  To get Part 1 and Part 2.
[01:27:25.697 --> 01:27:27.118]  And again, what's the headline?
[01:27:27.198 --> 01:27:30.960]  ClimateGate Part 1, ClimateGate Part 2.
[01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:42.888]  It's on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube and it's titled InfoWars.com ClimateGate 1, ClimateGate 2, Emergency Viral Transmission.
[01:27:44.048 --> 01:27:52.775]  Infowars.com, ClimateGate1, Emergency Viral Transmission, ClimateGate2, Emergency Viral Transmission.
[01:27:52.975 --> 01:27:55.958]  Viral trans- these are spikes!
[01:27:56.038 --> 01:27:59.380]  We're driving in the vampires' hearts with pleasure.
[01:28:00.001 --> 01:28:09.388]  This will absolutely devastate these criminals, these Church of Climatology fraudsters that have your children right now in public schools nationwide.
[01:28:10.109 --> 01:28:13.951]  Worldwide brainwashing them, telling them to tattle on their parents.
[01:28:14.011 --> 01:28:17.893]  New York Times with the kids being told to write their parents fake tickets.
[01:28:17.933 --> 01:28:19.074]  They're called climate cops.
[01:28:19.094 --> 01:28:20.775]  I mean you can't make this up.
[01:28:20.815 --> 01:28:26.038]  Teaching kids that at age 11 their climate credits run out and they should commit suicide.
[01:28:26.198 --> 01:28:28.199]  ABC News saying it's good.
[01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:33.102]  You cannot make up the bold, out-of-control, fraudulent,
[01:28:33.602 --> 01:28:35.724]  Scam that these people are running.
[01:28:35.804 --> 01:28:36.865]  It is such a joke.
[01:28:36.925 --> 01:28:44.153]  The big central banks have engineered this to bring in a Malthusian neo-feudalistic surf system.
[01:28:45.594 --> 01:28:49.918]  Here is part one of the video live on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:51.631 --> 01:28:53.052]  It is November 23rd, 2009.
[01:28:53.192 --> 01:28:58.556]  This is the most important video concerning man-made climate change that we've ever made.
[01:28:58.576 --> 01:29:03.460]  This is one of the most important video press releases that I have ever released.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:09.945]  Last week, hackers broke into a university computer system in England.
[01:29:10.825 --> 01:29:17.310]  The chief UN climate center, the main source of information they quote in their different reports.
[01:29:18.431 --> 01:29:20.513]  And they released thousands of emails.
[01:29:21.601 --> 01:29:23.482]  We've now had a chance to read over these emails.
[01:29:23.962 --> 01:29:25.163]  It's in the Associated Press.
[01:29:25.263 --> 01:29:25.983]  It's in Reuters.
[01:29:26.064 --> 01:29:27.444]  The BBC is covering it.
[01:29:28.005 --> 01:29:31.146]  It is a huge international story now known as Climategate.
[01:29:32.027 --> 01:29:36.289]  And we've had a chance to go over these documents and it only confirmed what we previously knew.
[01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:42.192]  Al Gore, two years ago, got caught claiming that carbon dioxide goes up and then temperatures go up.
[01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:43.553]  He actually flipped the graphs.
[01:29:43.993 --> 01:29:46.435]  Temperature goes up and then carbon dioxide goes up.
[01:29:48.137 --> 01:29:58.643]  Different universities and some of the ones named in these emails have been caught faking temperature readings from buoys and weather stations around the world.
[01:29:58.923 --> 01:30:00.304]  They always claim it's an accident.
[01:30:01.305 --> 01:30:09.470]  This chief United Nations scientist, Phil Jones, over the last five years has refused to release any of his data.
[01:30:10.475 --> 01:30:23.852]  Though it's being used for the UN to call for this global climate tax and to ban big televisions and to put tax on beef and taxes on having more than one child, total control of our society, and they won't release the source data.
[01:30:24.392 --> 01:30:27.416]  And that's one of the main reasons that the hackers obviously
[01:30:28.337 --> 01:30:32.059]  went into this system and got these emails because they wanted the climate data.
[01:30:32.359 --> 01:30:36.640]  They wanted to force it to be publicly published, not just a boil-down synopsis.
[01:30:36.881 --> 01:30:42.943]  Because so much of what is in these reports put out by this university and others has already been proven to be a fraud.
[01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:54.808]  And when scientists come out and say, well, your information is a fraud, and we have the actual weather readings from the sources you quoted, they say, shut up, you're a conspiracy theorist, you're paid by the oil companies, we're not going to let you look at our data.
[01:30:56.681 --> 01:31:00.030]  Now we know what happened, and this is so huge.
[01:31:00.131 --> 01:31:01.895]  I'm going to go over the spin they're putting out.
[01:31:03.055 --> 01:31:10.060]  to try to cover this up, because if this story in full gets out to the public, the global climate tax is over.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:18.946]  And we're going to play some clips coming up of the new EU president and others admitting that the global climate tax is the key to global government, global governance.
[01:31:18.966 --> 01:31:20.247]  These are quotes from them.
[01:31:20.287 --> 01:31:21.267]  The global government is here.
[01:31:21.828 --> 01:31:26.190]  It was Enron came up with the idea of the carbon tax in the mid-90s with Al Gore.
[01:31:26.331 --> 01:31:26.911]  It's a scam.
[01:31:27.872 --> 01:31:29.393]  And it has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:31:29.853 --> 01:31:32.815]  And they're on the verge of passing this in Copenhagen next month.
[01:31:33.475 --> 01:31:37.658]  And here in the United States with the climate bill now in the Senate that's passed the House.
[01:31:37.698 --> 01:31:40.340]  So this couldn't have come out at a more important time.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.962]  So here are a few key points that I've listed here that I want to go over.
[01:31:44.783 --> 01:31:46.344]  This is Climategate, number one.
[01:31:46.764 --> 01:31:48.225]  Number two, the emails are real.
[01:31:48.325 --> 01:31:52.368]  Number three, all the key UN data comes from these fraudulent sources.
[01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:55.150]  They would not show the public their data.
[01:31:55.491 --> 01:31:59.852]  This is scientific fraud and persecution of scientists that disagreed with them.
[01:32:00.072 --> 01:32:01.172]  That's also in the emails.
[01:32:01.212 --> 01:32:02.012]  How to persecute.
[01:32:02.212 --> 01:32:03.013]  How to blacklist.
[01:32:03.053 --> 01:32:03.933]  How to fire people.
[01:32:04.213 --> 01:32:05.213]  How to shut people down.
[01:32:05.233 --> 01:32:06.713]  I mean, this is criminal racketeering.
[01:32:07.514 --> 01:32:09.254]  We need a real investigation of this.
[01:32:09.854 --> 01:32:10.635]  Why the fraud?
[01:32:10.735 --> 01:32:12.135]  What are the goals of this system?
[01:32:13.701 --> 01:32:18.724]  And to use a Star Wars analogy, these several thousand emails are the Death Star plans.
[01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:21.186]  But having the Death Star plans is only part of it.
[01:32:21.446 --> 01:32:25.388]  We now have to carry out an attack in the Info War with this information.
[01:32:25.809 --> 01:32:31.852]  We're going to have full reports, in fact they're already up, at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com detailing all of this.
[01:32:32.393 --> 01:32:35.655]  This is a worldwide tax of fraud against you and your family.
[01:32:36.587 --> 01:32:46.760]  You need to educate yourselves immediately and then educate your friends, your family, your neighbors, your elected representatives, your public servants because this fight is all coming to a head right now.
[01:32:47.924 --> 01:32:50.707]  I also want to salute the hackers.
[01:32:50.987 --> 01:32:54.330]  They did something the police, MI5, the FBI wouldn't do.
[01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:57.973]  There have been Freedom of Information Act requests in the U.S.
[01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:00.916]  and similar requests in England that have never released this data.
[01:33:00.936 --> 01:33:01.917]  They're scared to release it.
[01:33:02.257 --> 01:33:03.018]  It's now public.
[01:33:03.238 --> 01:33:04.820]  So I salute the hackers.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:08.723]  I don't know who you are, but you're white hat hackers of the greatest epic level.
[01:33:09.204 --> 01:33:12.527]  I absolutely bow to you with total respect.
[01:33:12.627 --> 01:33:13.528]  Thank you so much.
[01:33:15.049 --> 01:33:19.435]  Because this is also an example for future hackers to really do important work.
[01:33:19.495 --> 01:33:20.316]  This is beautiful.
[01:33:20.557 --> 01:33:21.398]  This is epic.
[01:33:21.878 --> 01:33:22.680]  And I salute you.
[01:33:23.441 --> 01:33:24.102]  Alright, briefly.
[01:33:24.642 --> 01:33:25.544]  This is Climategate.
[01:33:25.564 --> 01:33:26.705]  This can bring down their whole system.
[01:33:27.066 --> 01:33:29.789]  Because all the other fraud they've been caught in, they always say is an accident.
[01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:42.520]  They also have the fraud of saying there's a total consensus, not one scientist doesn't believe that carbon dioxide is deadly poison and that we're all going to die if we don't tax it or ban it or restrict it when humans exhale five and a half pounds of it.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:48.104]  So they're also saying there's total consensus, even though 30 plus thousand scientists sent letters to Congress.
[01:33:49.766 --> 01:33:50.166]  Okay.
[01:33:50.947 --> 01:33:52.047]  That's part one.
[01:33:52.848 --> 01:33:54.129]  Now we're going to play part two.
[01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:58.292]  And I need everybody to get part one and part two and get them out to everybody.
[01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:07.195]  We need to get it ready for everyone, Part 1 and Part 2, going up on Infowars.com, going up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:08.175 --> 01:34:12.098]  I meant to make this under 10 minutes, it ended up being about 12, so that's why we had to cut it in two.
[01:34:12.278 --> 01:34:15.960]  Get it out to everyone, because in this 12 minutes, I break it all down.
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:17.240]  Here is Part 2.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:23.504]  Most of the scientists that signed on are the UN documents, and they were only consulted, but they don't even agree with it.
[01:34:23.804 --> 01:34:24.805]  So, that's another fraud.
[01:34:26.145 --> 01:34:27.246]  But the issue here is,
[01:34:28.427 --> 01:34:29.428]  The emails are real.
[01:34:29.668 --> 01:34:31.050]  Read the Associated Press.
[01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:32.811]  Read Reuters.
[01:34:33.232 --> 01:34:45.724]  Read the articles where they've called these scientists that are in these emails, these climatologists, and talked to them about it, and they've said, well, yes, we were hacked, and those are our emails, but they're being interpreted wrong.
[01:34:46.665 --> 01:34:49.128]  But see, there's a separate media spin right now.
[01:34:50.208 --> 01:34:53.370]  Where the press is saying, well, we don't know the emails are real.
[01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:53.750]  No.
[01:34:54.250 --> 01:35:02.675]  The university admits they were hacked, several thousand emails were stolen, and they're now spinning, saying, oh, well, this is being taken out of context.
[01:35:03.175 --> 01:35:09.739]  Quotes by Phil Jones and other climatologists writing to colleagues about graphs showing climate statistics over the last millennium.
[01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:13.681]  He alludes to techniques used by fellow scientists to hide the decline.
[01:35:15.922 --> 01:35:17.143]  And it goes on to say,
[01:35:17.947 --> 01:35:18.828]  We're good to go.
[01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:37.571]  Because the media contacted them quickly.
[01:35:38.091 --> 01:35:39.111]  Now they're not talking to the media.
[01:35:39.131 --> 01:35:40.332]  They figured out how they screwed up.
[01:35:40.352 --> 01:35:42.193]  They're going, well, I didn't mean that when I said it.
[01:35:42.233 --> 01:35:44.034]  Or, well, you're misinterpreting what I said.
[01:35:44.314 --> 01:35:47.475]  They've now, the source, has now confirmed these emails.
[01:35:47.695 --> 01:35:50.096]  Go read them for yourself on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:50.116 --> 01:35:50.857]  There's thousands of them.
[01:35:51.017 --> 01:35:52.217]  We're trying to go through them right now.
[01:35:52.978 --> 01:35:54.979]  The worst stuff's coming out every hour.
[01:35:55.619 --> 01:35:56.499]  Write your own articles.
[01:35:56.539 --> 01:35:57.400]  Post your own blogs.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.060]  Dig through it.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:00.801]  This is a community research project.
[01:36:01.401 --> 01:36:02.442]  This is so exciting.
[01:36:02.962 --> 01:36:04.023]  So we have that going on.
[01:36:04.043 --> 01:36:04.883]  The emails are real.
[01:36:05.825 --> 01:36:06.786]  All the key data.
[01:36:07.787 --> 01:36:11.610]  This particular university that nexused in with the Goddard Space Center in the U.S.
[01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:18.816]  and others, the Climate Research Unit, a leading global research center on climate change, run by Professor Phil Jones.
[01:36:19.216 --> 01:36:23.539]  He is sourced and quoted everywhere as the one that gives all the data to the U.N.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:30.005]  and then all the other scientific firms funded by the government, both private and governmental, then just agree with it.
[01:36:30.445 --> 01:36:31.506]  And then it's heresy
[01:36:31.946 --> 01:36:32.686]  If you question it.
[01:36:32.986 --> 01:36:33.826]  So that's going on.
[01:36:33.967 --> 01:36:35.767]  All their key data comes from this.
[01:36:35.987 --> 01:36:40.008]  This is the bottom card in the house of cards of the first domino.
[01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:41.288]  And it's now falling.
[01:36:42.268 --> 01:36:45.809]  And it's so essential that everyone get out there ahead of this media spin.
[01:36:45.849 --> 01:36:52.311]  Because the media, even though the people that wrote the emails are admitting they wrote them, the media's trying to spin it saying, well we don't know if those emails are real.
[01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:56.932]  And I predict the establishment's now going to insert fake emails in the coming days
[01:36:57.632 --> 01:37:04.876]  To try to disease the entire honeypot so that the media can then come out and try to discredit it.
[01:37:05.297 --> 01:37:15.863]  Kind of like it's admitted that Bush didn't go to a lot of his Air National Guard duties, but then some fake documents were put out by Karl Rove that CBS picked on, then discrediting the whole thing.
[01:37:15.923 --> 01:37:16.904]  So look for that trick.
[01:37:17.224 --> 01:37:18.144]  We know how they operate.
[01:37:19.305 --> 01:37:20.906]  Obviously this is scientific fraud.
[01:37:21.166 --> 01:37:23.426]  They've already been proven that their data was wrong.
[01:37:23.486 --> 01:37:24.607]  Now we know it was on purpose.
[01:37:24.887 --> 01:37:28.508]  But another big issue when you read these emails is, how do we get this guy fired?
[01:37:28.728 --> 01:37:31.349]  How do we have different scientific groups blackball this person?
[01:37:31.389 --> 01:37:32.509]  How do we remove their funding?
[01:37:32.729 --> 01:37:34.390]  How do we get this journal suspended?
[01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:37.570]  How do we stop these people from being able to submit to scientific journals?
[01:37:37.931 --> 01:37:42.492]  So this is a giant collusion, almost like the Catholic Church trying to stop Galileo
[01:37:42.952 --> 01:37:50.877]  From when he noticed that the moons of Jupiter were orbiting, he did mathematic calculations and could tell that the Earth was actually orbiting the Sun.
[01:37:52.202 --> 01:37:53.463]  So we have that going on.
[01:37:54.644 --> 01:37:56.005]  So incredible intimidation.
[01:37:56.085 --> 01:37:57.326]  They need to be raided.
[01:37:57.606 --> 01:37:59.047]  Their hard drives need to be grabbed.
[01:37:59.067 --> 01:38:00.168]  Their filing cabinets.
[01:38:00.449 --> 01:38:01.369]  Their communiques.
[01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:05.372]  Because they're pushing for a global government, global tax through all of this.
[01:38:05.793 --> 01:38:07.995]  An international system to control our lives.
[01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:11.517]  We're going to play that Von Rompey clip here.
[01:38:11.537 --> 01:38:18.303]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[01:38:19.303 --> 01:38:21.165]  The climate conference in Copenhagen
[01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:25.731]  is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[01:38:28.013 --> 01:38:35.639]  Our mission, our presidency is one of hope, supported by acts and by deeds.
[01:38:36.039 --> 01:38:37.921]  You look at the new head
[01:38:39.326 --> 01:38:47.688]  of the European Union, he is on record saying first year of global governance through the Copenhagen Treaty and the carbon tax.
[01:38:48.328 --> 01:38:53.248]  He's also quoted as calling for global management of the planet through the environmental crises.
[01:38:53.909 --> 01:39:07.911]  That's why the big banks, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, the Bank of England, all the money people are funding the climate change system because then they get to have a global government that manages and taxes the life-giving gas, carbon dioxide, that plants breathe.
[01:39:09.141 --> 01:39:10.462]  So we need a real investigation.
[01:39:11.784 --> 01:39:13.605]  And we know why there's all this fraud.
[01:39:13.665 --> 01:39:14.806]  We know what their goals are.
[01:39:15.607 --> 01:39:17.349]  Listing what plants breathe.
[01:39:19.306 --> 01:39:26.310]  What all human activity produces as a toxic waste that they can regulate, it gives them total control over every facet of our lives.
[01:39:26.610 --> 01:39:32.573]  And they're in the news, saying that they're going to decide what technologies can be developed, what technologies are going to be banned.
[01:39:32.953 --> 01:39:37.815]  London Guardian, global body needs to direct green technology, G77 says.
[01:39:38.296 --> 01:39:41.877]  Developed nations call for UN body to police battle on climate change.
[01:39:44.098 --> 01:39:44.959]  So that's going on.
[01:39:45.947 --> 01:39:53.284]  We're going to be covering this more in subsequent videos, but the emails, the documents, boil-downs of all the other previous fraud...
[01:39:54.261 --> 01:39:58.163]  The intimidation of scientists, it's all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:58.383 --> 01:40:07.868]  If we force this out into the public, which is already starting to happen, and expose the spin, and show people what's really happening, we can blow this thing sky high in the InfoWars.
[01:40:08.088 --> 01:40:11.770]  This is the equivalent of Bothans stealing the Death Star plans.
[01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:14.592]  Now we have to use these plans.
[01:40:14.952 --> 01:40:17.513]  I hope you understand the level of this.
[01:40:17.593 --> 01:40:19.014]  They admit the emails are real,
[01:40:20.066 --> 01:40:23.148]  This is meant to set up a world government in their own words.
[01:40:23.548 --> 01:40:25.289]  This is all being decided on right now.
[01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:26.830]  This is a godsend.
[01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:29.251]  This is one of the greatest blows against the new order I've ever seen.
[01:40:29.631 --> 01:40:31.552]  Last week, it passed out a committee in the House.
[01:40:31.572 --> 01:40:32.733]  They have 311 votes.
[01:40:33.033 --> 01:40:35.474]  It's sure to pass a strong Audit the Fed bill.
[01:40:35.895 --> 01:40:36.955]  The Senate tried to strip it.
[01:40:37.095 --> 01:40:38.336]  Some House members tried to strip it.
[01:40:38.356 --> 01:40:39.036]  They failed there.
[01:40:39.416 --> 01:40:41.538]  We're having victory after victory after victory.
[01:40:41.558 --> 01:40:46.941]  In my film, Follow the Republic, details how the banks are setting up this climate dictatorship.
[01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:49.062]  This dictatorship over resources.
[01:40:49.762 --> 01:40:51.143]  So please watch that film.
[01:40:51.183 --> 01:40:54.924]  We're going to put a link to it up in the corner here on YouTube to watch it in full for free.
[01:40:55.324 --> 01:40:56.325]  Give it to everyone you know.
[01:40:56.345 --> 01:40:57.625]  This film cost me $200,000 to make.

[01:41:02.047 --> 01:41:05.348]  But to all of you out there, this is not pearls before swine.
[01:41:05.668 --> 01:41:08.750]  This will annihilate the New World Order and their agenda.
[01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:14.452]  This has caught them red-handed and they need to be brought to justice, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:16.272]  Thank you for watching.
[01:41:16.492 --> 01:41:18.235]  Now, the rest is up to you.
[01:41:18.295 --> 01:41:19.117]  The ball's in your court.
[01:41:19.457 --> 01:41:20.459]  Please take action.
[01:41:21.921 --> 01:41:22.623]  Climategate.
[01:41:23.003 --> 01:41:23.725]  It can bring them down.
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:31.005]  ClimateGate, ladies and gentlemen, those videos at the Alex Jones channel at YouTube and on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:31.305 --> 01:41:33.087]  I'm going to come back and hit a few final news stories.
[01:41:33.107 --> 01:41:34.007]  I meant to get to more calls.
[01:41:34.027 --> 01:41:34.908]  We just ran out of time.
[01:41:34.928 --> 01:41:38.731]  I'm going to come back and hit a few final non-ClimateGate-related issues that are important.
[01:41:39.192 --> 01:41:43.995]  I also wanted today to tell you about a few of the sponsors that I believe in that made this radio show possible.
[01:41:44.075 --> 01:41:48.499]  One of them is EcolaBlue.com, their atmospheric water generator that grabs water right out of the air.
[01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:49.700]  I'm surprised the U.N.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.642]  hasn't listed water as evil yet, but they probably will.
[01:41:52.282 --> 01:41:53.643]  And it goes through seven filters.
[01:41:53.963 --> 01:41:56.325]  It ends today at midnight.
[01:41:56.705 --> 01:42:00.307]  Last day to get 20% off on the Acola Blue 28.
[01:42:00.467 --> 01:42:02.708]  They only do this every few months.
[01:42:03.549 --> 01:42:04.249]  20% off.
[01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:05.950]  And the sale ends today.
[01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:07.111]  It began last Thursday.
[01:42:07.131 --> 01:42:08.232]  acolablue.com
[01:42:12.898 --> 01:42:17.159]  To get 20% off, tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:42:17.179 --> 01:42:18.820]  We're giving them a call.

[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:21.781]  800-691-6043. acolablue.com.
[01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:24.822]  And lastly here, I wanted to thank FrontSight.

[01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:10.305]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.

[01:44:05.173 --> 01:44:08.176]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:08.416 --> 01:44:09.837]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:10.518 --> 01:44:13.179]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.199 --> 01:44:19.421]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.581 --> 01:44:24.623]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:25.123 --> 01:44:34.767]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.887 --> 01:44:36.988]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.228 --> 01:44:38.549]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.809 --> 01:44:41.110]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:43.131]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.411 --> 01:44:48.214]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:45:02.976 --> 01:45:04.937]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:45:05.477 --> 01:45:07.098]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[01:45:07.378 --> 01:45:14.502]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.

[01:46:00.467 --> 01:46:02.649]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:06.092]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:10.755 --> 01:46:12.817]  Okay, final segment here.
[01:46:13.898 --> 01:46:17.000]  As you know, there was some bad news this week.
[01:46:17.441 --> 01:46:22.265]  I kept telling everybody the Senate was going to pass to go to full debate the next month.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.443]  And they got the 60 votes they needed with the government takeover of health care.
[01:46:27.124 --> 01:46:29.086]  So that is a fight for our lives.
[01:46:29.166 --> 01:46:32.950]  Obama's health care bill clears first major Senate hurdle.
[01:46:34.171 --> 01:46:38.396]  Batch of H1N1 vaccine recalled for severe reactions.
[01:46:39.056 --> 01:46:39.937]  This is out of Canada.
[01:46:41.287 --> 01:46:43.468]  This is out of healthzone.ca.
[01:46:43.568 --> 01:46:50.451]  A batch of swine flu vaccine is being pulled back for investigation after it appeared to cause a higher rate of severe allergic reactions than other lots.
[01:46:50.531 --> 01:46:51.711]  See, they all do that.
[01:46:52.412 --> 01:47:07.298]  GlaxoSmithKline, Inc., which is producing the Canadian order of H1N1 influenza vaccine at its StiFoy, Quebec, said it asked provincial and territorial health authorities Wednesday to stop using doses from a specific lot shipment distributed last month.
[01:47:08.278 --> 01:47:16.680]  And it's now coming out that researchers believe in Ukraine that Baxter and other vaccine trials may be causing the super outbreak that's happening there.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.080]  We'll cover that more tomorrow.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.681]  By the way, Charlie Sheen's on the show tomorrow.
[01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:29.322]  Climatologist Tim Ball is on, who's been targeted by these people to break down ClimateGate and a bunch of other big guests tomorrow.
[01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:33.383]  It's an amazing broadcast right before Thanksgiving that we've got coming up.
[01:47:34.324 --> 01:47:35.604]  I've been meaning to cover this.
[01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:36.444]  The secret
[01:47:37.953 --> 01:47:38.253]  U.N.
[01:47:38.313 --> 01:47:43.797]  treaty that Obama declared national security on and every other government in concert won't release has been leaked as well.
[01:47:44.437 --> 01:47:52.722]  It says no judge, no jury, they're just going to ban you from ever using the internet off IP addresses if you're ever caught file sharing, restricts free speech.
[01:47:53.183 --> 01:48:00.728]  Boing Boing's got a great article on it, Britain's new internet law, as bad as everyone's been saying and worse, much much worse, and they have quotes from
[01:48:01.704 --> 01:48:02.164]  I don't
[01:48:20.492 --> 01:48:21.953]  This woman quit as governor.
[01:48:22.073 --> 01:48:22.834]  She's a joke.
[01:48:23.334 --> 01:48:24.415]  She's a neocon.
[01:48:24.775 --> 01:48:30.178]  They hold her up as the great patron of conservatism because they can destroy her in the next election.
[01:48:30.538 --> 01:48:32.400]  If she's on the ticket, Obama will beat her.
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:38.904]  And imagine if we could get all these mindless Palin supporters to become true patriots and go confront Al Gore by the thousands.
[01:48:39.164 --> 01:48:40.305]  Though that is starting to happen.
[01:48:41.983 --> 01:48:43.804]  Also, there's an analysis from the AP.
[01:48:43.904 --> 01:48:46.145]  Fed under fire as public anger mounts.
[01:48:46.545 --> 01:48:48.946]  Suddenly, the Federal Reserve is everybody's punching bag.
[01:48:49.246 --> 01:48:55.269]  And it goes on to talk about how in polls, between 75 and 80 plus percent absolutely hate them and blame them for everything.
[01:48:55.289 --> 01:48:57.890]  Well, yeah, they are the real shadow government.
[01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:00.371]  And so a lot of exciting things are happening.
[01:49:00.671 --> 01:49:02.111]  Bizarre story out of Reuters.
[01:49:02.412 --> 01:49:05.033]  Radiation leak investigated at Three Mile Island.
[01:49:06.033 --> 01:49:09.616]  Federal officials are investigating a radiation leak at Three Mile Island, scene of the worst U.S.
[01:49:09.656 --> 01:49:13.438]  nuclear power accident, but said Sunday there was no threat to public safety.
[01:49:14.059 --> 01:49:16.320]  Also, another guy was in a coma for 23 years.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.062]  Thank God they didn't pull the plug on him.
[01:49:19.202 --> 01:49:21.404]  He's been revived, it turns out, for 23 years.
[01:49:21.444 --> 01:49:22.445]  He's been totally awake.
[01:49:22.465 --> 01:49:25.927]  Can you imagine the hell of being locked in your body while all that's happening?
[01:49:26.327 --> 01:49:28.909]  Also, newspaper circulation may be worse than it looks.
[01:49:28.969 --> 01:49:31.951]  Total implosion of the newspapers, because they're a bunch of lying scum.
[01:49:32.471 --> 01:49:34.373]  Newspapers that tell the truth are actually doing well.
[01:49:35.193 --> 01:49:40.575]  I've got to get better at plugging stuff early in the show, because I tend to plug all four hours of sponsors right here at the end, but they make the show possible.
[01:49:40.915 --> 01:49:43.056]  In closing, I want to thank Silver Lungs.
[01:49:43.456 --> 01:49:45.516]  I want to tell you about SilverLungs.com.
