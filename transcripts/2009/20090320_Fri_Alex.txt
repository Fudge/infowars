[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.111]  That's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:04.833]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:05.173]  Wake up!
[00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:05.433]  Wake up!
[00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:06.794]  Good morning America!
[00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:07.475]  Rise and shine!
[00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:08.456]  Wake up!
[00:00:09.777 --> 00:00:10.778]  Rise and shine!
[00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:11.198]  Rock Paul!
[00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:17.123]  Save our constitutional rights!
[00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:19.705]  Rock Paul!
[00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:26.250]  We're not gonna give up the fight!
[00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.231]  Rock Paul!
[00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:48.077]  We don't want big government, or the Bilderberg Group that pays for it.
[00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:52.838]  Federal ID means a police state in this time.
[00:00:53.078 --> 00:00:58.159]  Jefferson's rolling in his grave, and our names turn to numbers like 666.
[00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.200]  Go do the gospel on a planet with chips.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.222]  Save our constitutional rights.
[00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:25.463]  I think so.
[00:01:55.467 --> 00:02:12.451]  We haven't followed the Constitution and that's what we ought to be doing.
[00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.132]  The system that we have today is ripping off the middle class and the poor.
[00:02:17.793 --> 00:02:22.834]  Can you imagine how great a nation we'd have if we didn't have the Federal Reserve System printing all this money?
[00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:33.250]  Alright folks, you can go online and just Google Amy Allen, see all her great music videos and other materials.
[00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:36.603]  You know, it's very, very exciting.
[00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.024]  People say, oh, well, Ron Paul didn't win the presidency.
[00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:47.245]  But now you're seeing the huge delayed reaction of that movement spilling out into thousands of other areas of society.
[00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:53.806]  And the federal government through the states is having to put out things like the MIAC report saying, if you have a Ron Paul sticker, basically, you're a terrorist.
[00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:54.946]  If you're a libertarian, you're a terrorist.
[00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.307]  No, they're scared of our bumper stickers.
[00:02:57.347 --> 00:02:58.707]  They're scared of our ideas.
[00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:01.908]  They're trying to claim we're a bunch of cop killers when there's no evidence of that.
[00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.088]  Because we're the real American people.
[00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:21.642]  Uh, who want liberty, who want freedom, understand that we have a new world order taking over our nation and they're very afraid of popular culture, uh, further popularizing the message of liberty and Amy Allen's gone a long way towards doing that and she's here in Austin, Texas for South by Southwest.
[00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:26.886]  We'll tell you about some of the shows that are coming up with her, but it's great to have you here in Austin, Texas with us.
[00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:27.827]  Thank you so much.
[00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:28.708]  Thanks for having me.
[00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:35.110]  I'm excited about the movement that you're talking about still continuing.
[00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:49.135]  In Los Angeles, there was actually Fullerton, there was a tea party and 15,000 people came out to protest the tax increases and a lot of those people, 15,000 people, shut down the streets a couple weeks ago.
[00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:50.175]  I think?
[00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:05.188]  No.
[00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:31.803]  Documents where they're trying to covertly demonize us, showing that the establishment is scared of the American people, and knows that we have a chance of bringing the International Crime Syndicate to justice.
[00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:37.507]  Now, tell folks how you woke up to Liberty, a little bit about yourself, and then, uh, Jason Burma's had you, uh,
[00:04:38.408 --> 00:04:55.219]  in a few nights ago on the Info Warrior show that he does from 9 to midnight out of the same studio and I didn't know about this, that right after you were on my show, it looks like, this has happened to me, but they've been punching me and telling me shut up, you know, don't talk about, but beating you with a crowbar and then not stealing anything.
[00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:57.040]  It was very bizarre.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.001]  It was very bizarre.
[00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:06.807]  I was with three people, I mean there's three of us, and they pushed one of, they pushed my friend out of the way to target me and there was two guys
[00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.507]  Beating my head and face, and that's it.
[00:05:09.547 --> 00:05:13.108]  Just my mouth, broke my jaw, and beat me with a crowbar.
[00:05:14.488 --> 00:05:15.409]  Well, I can't see any of it.
[00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.649]  You still look extremely lovely.
[00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:16.889]  Thank you.
[00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:17.729]  Just the same as you did before.
[00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:19.109]  But yeah, it was last summer.
[00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:20.570]  But they, thank you.
[00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.510]  They dumped out all of our purses.
[00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.451]  I was with two waitresses.
[00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:25.331]  I had tons of cash.
[00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:26.511]  I had tons of cash.
[00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:28.771]  They dumped out our purses, telling them to take our money.
[00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.192]  And they kicked the money and left and walked away.
[00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:33.792]  And I thought, that's bizarre.
[00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:34.493]  What do they look like?
[00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.253]  It's important how they were dressed and what they looked like.
[00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:47.594]  Um, they were, you know, I think, I think they were, I don't know, they were, um, you know, Mexican gang members, probably, most likely.
[00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:50.760]  So it was either the government or somebody hired them or it was a gang initiation.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.301]  Correct.
[00:05:52.893 --> 00:05:55.655]  But it was bizarre that I was the only one that they hit.
[00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:57.156]  They didn't touch the other two.
[00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:01.119]  Well, in LA, it's on record in congressional testimony, the big gangs work for the CIA.
[00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:05.242]  Well, the police told me they're probably illegal aliens, so we're not even going to pursue it.
[00:06:05.482 --> 00:06:07.363]  You know, they're probably not on record anywhere.
[00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:08.204]  Yeah, that's how it is.
[00:06:08.224 --> 00:06:09.125]  They're just invincible.
[00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:09.625]  Yeah.
[00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:12.787]  Fake IDs, just do whatever they want.
[00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:15.009]  So, they were meeting with a crowbar?
[00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.409]  Yeah.
[00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.630]  I almost died.
[00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.092]  I have some memory loss.
[00:06:22.561 --> 00:06:23.942]  Well, you need to start carrying a heater.
[00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:25.344]  Right?
[00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:25.824]  I do.
[00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:26.445]  I do.
[00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:30.549]  No, I mean, it's our Second Amendment right, so that's what we do.
[00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.012]  And it's important to do.
[00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:34.253]  Yeah, I need to.
[00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:36.960]  I have a taser right now.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.600]  That's good.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.242]  Yeah, it's illegal in most states and it's really powerful.
[00:06:41.103 --> 00:06:44.466]  By the way, the people always try to, when I say that, they go, well you're a hypocrite, you're against tasers.
[00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:48.309]  No, I'm against police using them when somebody just argues with them.
[00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:54.113]  Or, don't tase me bro, I'm not against guns or tasers themselves, I'm against their misuse.
[00:06:54.153 --> 00:06:56.475]  My taser's more powerful than police tasers.
[00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:58.336]  So it's a very, very powerful taser.
[00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:01.198]  I know they've recently come out with an even more high-powered taser from Taser International.
[00:07:01.238 --> 00:07:01.879]  It's amazing.
[00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:02.940]  Yeah, I've got a great one.
[00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.480]  How many volts or watts is it?
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.040]  I forget.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.402]  But I know that it's illegal in most states, which means it's pretty powerful.
[00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:10.523]  I'm very excited about that.
[00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:12.044]  Although I think it's legal in Texas.
[00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:19.168]  Yeah, well you almost died, so... You know, we need to get past our fear of guns, but properly, you know, learn how to use them.
[00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.571]  I mean, that's so important to do so we can protect ourselves.
[00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:24.892]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:26.193 --> 00:07:31.136]  I mean, you know, we've gone from a culture that understood the Second Amendment to a culture that
[00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:39.117]  is afraid of it and and that's the biggest fighter trying to create the illusion uh... that you know it's a bad thing we have to take the moral high ground back
[00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:42.633]  So they were targeting you specifically?
[00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:44.034]  Targeting me specifically.
[00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:49.438]  And who knows why, maybe they just decided I was their target.
[00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:54.462]  It was weird because it was a couple days after I spoke about the CIA on the show.
[00:07:55.443 --> 00:08:02.348]  That's right, the CIA went in, because you've had music on the charts, you've had stuff on MTV, correct?
[00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:07.993]  And they're really scared of that kind of anthem that could really damage them.
[00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:10.775]  So tell folks the CIA story, the first CIA story.
[00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:21.198]  Well, the first CIA story is that it was right after 9-11 and they called my label and said to remove any reference to starting a revolution on my website.
[00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.999]  So, that's the first CIA story.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:38.391]  The second CIA story is I have befriended a CIA agent who has high security clearance and he told me specifically that they're not allowed to visit Infowars.com, Prison Planet.
[00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.593]  Uh, because they could get fired.
[00:08:41.173 --> 00:08:44.196]  And so any information... So they don't even trust him with their own minds?
[00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:46.579]  They could get fired for even looking at it.
[00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:47.359]  Because it's the truth.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.385]  Uh, now, you met this guy on an airplane, you've, you know, gotten to know him, and, uh... So any information... What'd you say about 9-11 truth?
[00:08:54.796 --> 00:09:06.319]  Um, he said that he hasn't told his wife or his friends or anyone about what he knows about it and what he thinks about it out of fear for his job.
[00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:12.080]  Well, we've had Bill Christensen, who was a CIA section chief over Berlin, one of the most important ones, saying, total inside job.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.621]  We've had the victim's family groups on, the largest groups.
[00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:16.622]  I don't know.
[00:09:37.498 --> 00:09:40.701]  Again, it's so compartmentalized even within their own structure.
[00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.122]  And they're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:43.643]  They're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:48.166]  So it is a good sign that, secretly at least, that they're on our side.
[00:09:48.486 --> 00:09:50.188]  Well, some of them are.
[00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:50.768]  Some of them.
[00:09:50.808 --> 00:09:51.208]  Some of them.
[00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:54.191]  Some of them are just psychopathic criminals or they're foreign contractors.
[00:09:54.851 --> 00:10:00.455]  And the CIA is just kind of a catch-all for the 30-plus intelligence agencies, the 15 big ones.
[00:10:01.096 --> 00:10:03.918]  And then they've got so many private contractors out doing stuff.
[00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:04.617]  Right.
[00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:07.763]  You know, they find people in special forces that are psychos, like to kill.
[00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:11.189]  They give them all these missions, killing whole villages and stuff, then they just bring them back home.
[00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:12.712]  Right.
[00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:18.121]  So you've never talked about that until you came on the show here about the CIA contacting your label.
[00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.283]  For those that don't know, I don't know about your particular case, I believe it.
[00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:24.827]  It was in mainstream news that the White House and CIA contact Hollywood.
[00:10:24.948 --> 00:10:26.289]  No anti-government messages.
[00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:28.531]  Get behind the country.
[00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:29.692]  We've been attacked.
[00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.374]  And so we know they do that.
[00:10:31.394 --> 00:10:34.517]  And now they're going to spend $40-something billion a year, the Pentagon alone, on its image.
[00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:36.218]  And so you see all these rock bands.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:44.722]  Kid Rock's not being attacked, or Three Doors Down's not being attacked with their get the kids in the military to go die line of propaganda.
[00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:45.862]  It's only you getting attacked.
[00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:46.482]  Correct.
[00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.843]  Well, I'm not going to stop talking about it, so.
[00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:51.683]  How did you wake up to the New World Order?
[00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:58.545]  Well, I was born and raised in Montana, and so it's a little bit like Texas.
[00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:04.106]  Since I was a kid, you know, my family talked about wanting to secede from the Union, so I was sort of
[00:11:04.773 --> 00:11:09.775]  Raised, uh, raised with that, uh, my mom talked about the new world order.
[00:11:10.175 --> 00:11:11.016]  Al-Qaeda raised?
[00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:11.856]  Uh, yeah.
[00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:17.919]  She, she told me, you know, as a small child that there was going to be a one world currency one day and that we need to prepare.
[00:11:17.979 --> 00:11:20.540]  So, I've sort of always kind of known.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.781]  Well, now nobody's laughing at mama.
[00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:25.822]  It's all over the news, but they're saying it's a good idea.
[00:11:26.842 --> 00:11:28.303]  It's, yeah, exactly.
[00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:29.524]  We gotta buy gold.
[00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:32.783]  Well, that's what we're trying to get folks to do.
[00:11:33.464 --> 00:11:34.585]  The Obama Deception's out.
[00:11:34.825 --> 00:11:35.485]  Yep, it's beautiful.
[00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:36.306]  I want to give you a copy.
[00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:36.846]  Thank you so much.
[00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:38.007]  There you go, there's the DVD.
[00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:39.028]  Hey, thank you.
[00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:43.051]  Let's come back in to whatever you want to discuss, South by Southwest, the Liberty Movement.
[00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.913]  It's, you know, a lot bigger than Alex Jones or Ron Paul or anybody else.
[00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:48.474]  It's about the people and a bunch of key news.
[00:11:48.494 --> 00:11:55.039]  We'll get Amy Allen's take on all of that and a lot more straight ahead after this break.
[00:11:57.429 --> 00:12:00.411]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:02.712]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:06.334]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:07.295]  Be smart.

[00:12:53.727 --> 00:13:02.995]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:10.482]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:17.254]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:19.496]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:22.038]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:22.138 --> 00:13:33.065]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:33.706 --> 00:13:34.987]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:35.387 --> 00:13:36.728]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:37.228 --> 00:13:43.571]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:51.915]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com, or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:53.556]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:53.976 --> 00:13:55.236]  The people strike back.
[00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.079]  Peter Craftschambl here from Midas Resources.
[00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:02.800]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.241]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[00:14:05.851 --> 00:14:07.732]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[00:14:08.272 --> 00:14:10.152]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[00:14:10.752 --> 00:14:13.073]  Scandal after scandal with hedge fund companies?
[00:14:13.613 --> 00:14:18.495]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:21.535]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[00:14:22.076 --> 00:14:30.278]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.082]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[00:14:34.563 --> 00:14:36.785]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:38.066]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:40.429]  While you can still purchase gold with paper, that is 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:58.416]  Spring is here.
[00:14:58.656 --> 00:14:59.436]  Growing season.
[00:14:59.616 --> 00:15:01.598]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.239]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:04.199]  Think about it.
[00:15:04.499 --> 00:15:08.362]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:15:08.602 --> 00:15:12.084]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.965]  The country is running out of food.
[00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:16.807]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:15:17.087 --> 00:15:18.868]  At OrganicaSeed.com

[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.121]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[00:16:07.469 --> 00:16:10.531]  Amy Allen's new album is coming out here pretty soon.
[00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:12.252]  Amy Allen, A Little Happiness.
[00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:15.293]  Tell us about this new one.
[00:16:15.553 --> 00:16:24.237]  It's organic, no synthetic sounds, all Hammond B3 organs, acoustic bass, acoustic guitar.
[00:16:24.597 --> 00:16:32.381]  It's kind of like an acoustic reggae album for the most part, but there's no profanity in it and it's, you know, my
[00:16:33.666 --> 00:16:34.407]  I'm very proud of it.
[00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.127]  Very proud of it.
[00:16:35.187 --> 00:16:36.388]  Well, I love all the music you've made.
[00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:37.468]  How many albums have you done?
[00:16:37.488 --> 00:16:41.471]  Um... Three.
[00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:42.352]  Three albums.
[00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:50.397]  Scott and Amy, my album on Elektra Records, and this on Sidetrack Records, coming out June 9th.
[00:16:51.237 --> 00:16:52.578]  Is this political like the others?
[00:16:53.959 --> 00:17:01.164]  Um... It's... No, that isn't... No, there's not a lot of political messages in it, but...
[00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:11.274]  It's for people who need to calm down.
[00:17:11.775 --> 00:17:13.535]  It's relaxing.
[00:17:14.755 --> 00:17:16.556]  I needed a healing record after my assault.
[00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:21.798]  I needed to record something that wasn't loud, distorted, synthetic, overproduced.
[00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.438]  I just needed to do a very simple record.
[00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:25.699]  Are any of these up on the web yet?
[00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:26.199]  We can play them.
[00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:28.800]  I don't think we're fancy enough to have a CD player in the studio.
[00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:31.202]  Okay, good.
[00:17:31.242 --> 00:17:32.603]  So we are going to have some of that coming up.
[00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:32.923]  That's good.
[00:17:32.943 --> 00:17:34.123]  We're coming out of the break with one then.
[00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:35.524]  Fantastic.
[00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:41.586]  So you grew up in the West, a family that was aware of the globalist agenda.
[00:17:41.606 --> 00:17:46.367]  I mean, did you believe your family when they were warning you, when your mother was warning you about all the stuff that was coming?
[00:17:47.508 --> 00:17:52.210]  Not so much in the beginning, but she was stockpiling food, making our own bread.
[00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.111]  You know, she's making her own food.
[00:17:55.191 --> 00:18:00.112]  She was, I mean, she was absolutely, she just kind of banged it in my head my whole life.
[00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:14.997]  Well, that's a good instinct because they had their whole mechanism in place to bring in martial law then, but we knew that back when I started 14 years ago that they weren't going to launch it right at that point because they hadn't propagandized enough yet and that they had to announce it first that that would herald their move.
[00:18:15.317 --> 00:18:16.218]  Now they're announcing it.
[00:18:16.238 --> 00:18:16.998]  Does that concern you?
[00:18:17.378 --> 00:18:18.798]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:19.459]  It's happened in a
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.102]  In such a short period of time.
[00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:23.064]  That's what's astounding.
[00:18:23.344 --> 00:18:25.728]  It's happening very rapidly.
[00:18:25.748 --> 00:18:26.930]  At this point.
[00:18:27.812 --> 00:18:33.461]  The New World Order foretold for so long, because the old timers actually had the government documents, now is upon us.
[00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:34.143]  Yeah.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:41.525]  You know, I talk a lot about a quickening or an awakening happening that's much bigger than what we saw last year with Ron Paul being the focal point.
[00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:44.166]  Are you seeing that same awakening out there?
[00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:46.028]  Yeah, it's really refreshing.
[00:18:46.068 --> 00:18:55.374]  And to see it on AOL, I mean, the cover of AOL, to talk about the Bilderberg Group, at 70%, I read the poll and it said 70%, 26,000 people took the poll and 70% had never heard of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:55.794]  So that's very...
[00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.350]  Very encouraging.
[00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:06.513]  And the majority were asked if they liked it and they said they thought it was a bad thing.
[00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:06.814]  Right.
[00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:21.704]  So I guess they need to be arrested as terrorists because the federally written reports distributed by the states, they're out running around saying if you put a Ron Paul bumper sticker on or believe in a Bilderberg Group or a New World Order, you're a dangerous person.
[00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:23.549]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:26.550]  I mean, we're all terrorists.
[00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.311]  It's Nazi Germany, just with different clothes.
[00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:36.693]  Well, expanding on that, when this broke last week, when we broke it, I had remembered a Texas flyer.
[00:19:37.114 --> 00:19:37.894]  I'd been so busy.
[00:19:37.914 --> 00:19:39.874]  I knew we'd posted it on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:39.894 --> 00:19:40.975]  I hadn't even Google-searched it.
[00:19:40.995 --> 00:19:43.956]  I just said, hey, Alabama, Texas, it's come out.
[00:19:44.396 --> 00:19:45.856]  I finally did print some of those last night.
[00:19:45.876 --> 00:19:47.617]  And then Jim Mars, who's in here in about 30 minutes,
[00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:55.304]  I opened the door during the break and he goes, well you were there, he goes, look Alex, don't forget the Texas one, it says the same thing the Missouri one says.
[00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:56.866]  And I'm like, oh, there it is.
[00:19:56.886 --> 00:19:59.869]  So we're going to scan that back in and show that coming up.
[00:19:59.909 --> 00:20:01.791]  So there was Jim, you know, with another one.
[00:20:01.811 --> 00:20:03.013]  These are everywhere.
[00:20:03.613 --> 00:20:05.194]  And it says the same thing this one says.
[00:20:05.534 --> 00:20:10.895]  These are nice people that work at soup kitchens and say they're involved in government and that they want less government.
[00:20:11.096 --> 00:20:13.376]  But they're secretly shell group terrorists.
[00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:16.637]  This one says it and the Texas one says it from four years ago.
[00:20:16.777 --> 00:20:17.438]  And the Christians.
[00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:22.219]  I mean, if you're a Christian and you believe in, you know, freedom, you're a terrorist.
[00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:26.501]  Yeah, but if you're one of these Obama-worshipping or Bush-worshipping ones, then it's good.
[00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:27.081]  Yeah.
[00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:28.809]  It's terrifying.
[00:20:29.189 --> 00:20:30.610]  What are you most concerned about these days?
[00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:38.516]  You know, the House just passed the forced national compulsory service that's going to the Senate, and it says you'll have to serve in the military, domestically or foreign.
[00:20:38.536 --> 00:20:41.278]  How does that sound?
[00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:41.779]  I don't know.
[00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.560]  You know, it's crazy.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.261]  It's crazy.
[00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:48.844]  But I'm a little concerned about our tax dollars going to bail out foreign banks.
[00:20:48.984 --> 00:20:51.026]  That's kind of upsetting me lately.
[00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:52.835]  Yeah, I know.
[00:20:52.855 --> 00:20:55.057]  And it doesn't seem to be upsetting the country.
[00:20:55.077 --> 00:20:58.220]  Everyone's just sort of taking it like, oh, okay, I guess that's what we're doing now.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.922]  Well, the mainstream media keeps chattering like everything's happy.
[00:21:01.142 --> 00:21:04.626]  It's kind of like Baghdad Bob, member of the information spokesman for...
[00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:09.136]  The Iraqi military in 2003, and the tanks are lit.
[00:21:09.156 --> 00:21:11.237]  There's explosions going off two miles behind him.
[00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:15.198]  There's jets flying by, bombing, and he's going, the Americans are 200 miles away.
[00:21:15.258 --> 00:21:15.998]  We have defeated them.
[00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:17.078]  We have routed them.
[00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:19.379]  And so that's what the establishment does.
[00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:20.400]  They're like, everything's fine.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.380]  Everyone loves government.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.000]  Everyone's happy with what's happening.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.280]  Right.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.202]  And if you believe the government might be corrupt, you are secretly a terrorist that wants to kill men, women, and children.
[00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:28.442]  Right.
[00:21:28.482 --> 00:21:31.043]  We're going to take some calls for Amy Allen right now.
[00:21:32.063 --> 00:21:34.384]  Opening the phones up.
[00:21:34.404 --> 00:21:35.024]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:35.424]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:21:35.804 --> 00:21:40.126]  We'll take your calls.
[00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:45.448]  On the other side for our guest, Amy Allen in studio here in Austin, Texas for South by Southwest 2009.
[00:21:45.848 --> 00:21:46.668]  Jim Maher's coming up.
[00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:48.409]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:50.490]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.503 --> 00:21:58.684]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:21:58.864 --> 00:22:01.146]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:05.289]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:08.111]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call
[00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:21.376]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:22:21.596 --> 00:22:27.740]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.382]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:22:31.582 --> 00:22:35.724]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoodsDirect.
[00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:45.684]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:09.224]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:15.949]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:16.249 --> 00:23:18.071]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:20.633]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:20.693 --> 00:23:31.581]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:35.130]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.931]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:43.734]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:52.578 --> 00:23:53.719]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:54.139 --> 00:23:55.340]  The people strike back.
[00:23:56.883 --> 00:23:58.384]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:23:58.584 --> 00:24:00.026]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:24:00.326 --> 00:24:02.568]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:07.752]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:24:08.152 --> 00:24:10.995]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:24:11.335 --> 00:24:14.818]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:27.236]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:24:27.796 --> 00:24:29.778]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:24:29.798 --> 00:24:31.099]  I use one every day.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.942]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:34.783]  We're good.
[00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.591]  We're good to go.
[00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:31.737]  We're good to go.
[00:25:57.227 --> 00:25:57.587]  We're good.
[00:26:13.035 --> 00:26:15.957]  That's a little bit of a change in weather.
[00:26:16.718 --> 00:26:19.740]  Save Me, On Vacation, Crazy, Calling the Maker.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.142]  So this is really a spiritual album too, isn't it?
[00:26:23.162 --> 00:26:24.483]  Yeah, it's a spiritual album.
[00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:26.945]  I talk about God a lot on the album.
[00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:28.086]  Sounds great.
[00:26:28.246 --> 00:26:30.187]  I talk a lot about social commentary.
[00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.449]  It's beautiful.
[00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:35.511]  Hopefully it'll make people happy.
[00:26:35.671 --> 00:26:38.574]  My plan is to do a tea party tour with the album.
[00:26:38.774 --> 00:26:50.804]  It's a lot of reggae, and I feel like reggae makes people... And they're having tea party rallies all over the country, left, right, coming together, saying, no more taxation without representation.
[00:26:50.864 --> 00:27:00.652]  If it isn't taxation without representation, where the fellow reserves give in total power to just print trillions of dollars and give it to themselves while cutting off credit to the people, if that isn't it, I don't know what is.
[00:27:00.692 --> 00:27:01.893]  But finish your point about reggae.
[00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:17.421]  Well, you know, Bob Marley, you know, his reggae music revolutionized the political system in Jamaica and I feel that reggae, I don't need to be screaming through rock songs to get a message across.
[00:27:17.561 --> 00:27:29.070]  I feel that reggae has a way of making people happy and brings people together in a loving way and I would love to have a tea party tour where we hit every city and we give freedom
[00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:37.155]  Liberty-loving individuals a place to come and find other people like-minded people.
[00:27:37.215 --> 00:27:38.055]  So that's the goal.
[00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:42.197]  Well you're doing a super good job evidenced by being physically attacked.
[00:27:42.257 --> 00:27:43.898]  I think that thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:27:44.218 --> 00:27:46.659]  How long did that knock you out of commission when they almost killed you?
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.700]  A long, very long time.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.521]  A couple months.
[00:27:50.393 --> 00:28:01.583]  And I barely... It was funny because the Campaign for Liberty sent out a press release that I was performing at the Rally for the Republic, and at that point I couldn't open my mouth at all.
[00:28:01.944 --> 00:28:05.026]  And they sent out the press release and I thought, oh no.
[00:28:05.127 --> 00:28:08.650]  And then they called me the next day and said, we're so sorry that we sent that press release.
[00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.410]  Will you do it?
[00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:10.531]  Will you perform?
[00:28:11.252 --> 00:28:13.013]  And I barely opened my mouth.
[00:28:13.033 --> 00:28:15.475]  I was like, okay, I'll do it, you know?
[00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:17.897]  Because they broke your jaw.
[00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:18.517]  They broke your jaw.
[00:28:18.537 --> 00:28:18.757]  Right.
[00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:25.522]  With just having enough faith knowing, you know what, I'm just going to say that I'll do it and hopefully by the time it rolls around, I'll be able to open my mouth.
[00:28:25.883 --> 00:28:32.207]  And literally a few days, a week before the rally for the republic, I actually could open my mouth enough to sing.
[00:28:32.267 --> 00:28:34.289]  So it was really amazing.
[00:28:34.429 --> 00:28:35.770]  Just in the nick of time.
[00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:36.390]  So, yeah.
[00:28:37.371 --> 00:28:39.312]  Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:28:39.332 --> 00:28:40.013]  Absolutely.
[00:28:41.212 --> 00:28:42.512]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:46.834]  Now, before we do that, any other points you want to add about the album or South by Southwest or what you're doing?
[00:28:47.754 --> 00:28:50.996]  Well, it's my first time at South by Southwest and I love it.
[00:28:51.016 --> 00:28:52.116]  I wouldn't mind moving here.
[00:28:52.176 --> 00:28:56.097]  And especially if Texas secedes from the Union, I'll be the first in line.
[00:28:56.117 --> 00:28:58.018]  And with our new president, Chuck Norris.
[00:28:58.178 --> 00:28:58.919]  I'm down.
[00:28:58.939 --> 00:28:59.839]  Definitely.
[00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:00.779]  I'm into it.
[00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:01.219]  Love it.
[00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.360]  I love Austin and I love South by Southwest.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.981]  The vice president will be Jim Mars.
[00:29:06.521 --> 00:29:06.841]  Yeah.
[00:29:07.202 --> 00:29:07.622]  Let's do it.
[00:29:09.489 --> 00:29:10.011]  Oh my god.
[00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:10.492]  I really hope.
[00:29:10.512 --> 00:29:14.503]  You know, some say it's just a dream, but I truly hope it happens.
[00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:16.047]  What do you think?
[00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:16.829]  Do you think it's even...
[00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:18.960]  Possibility?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.721]  You know, anything can happen in history.
[00:29:20.821 --> 00:29:26.547]  I would rather take our entire country back and not allow them to balkanize us because that's actually in their cards.
[00:29:27.488 --> 00:29:36.056]  But if the new world order just continues to totally destroy the Republic, we'll have to take the states back piece by piece and then decide if we want to reconvene the Union.
[00:29:36.477 --> 00:29:40.340]  And that's the power of the states under the 9th and 10th Amendment and the Declaration of Independence Constitution.
[00:29:40.761 --> 00:29:41.141]  And so,
[00:29:42.102 --> 00:29:48.987]  We don't have a choice, and we have to believe that things like that can happen, and that we have power and can affect change, because history shows that.
[00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:51.189]  That's why the establishment is so scared of us.
[00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.430]  Right.
[00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.171]  Keep pushing.
[00:29:54.212 --> 00:29:54.712]  Absolutely.
[00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:55.653]  Let's go to calls here.
[00:29:56.233 --> 00:29:58.295]  Let's talk to Billy in New Jersey.
[00:29:58.315 --> 00:29:59.576]  You're on the air with Amy Allen.
[00:30:00.737 --> 00:30:01.257]  Hello, Amy.
[00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:02.058]  Hi.
[00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.481]  I'm a huge fan of your work, and it's such an honor to speak with you.
[00:30:07.102 --> 00:30:07.422]  Thank you.
[00:30:07.522 --> 00:30:11.105]  I'm a songwriter myself, and I have a couple questions, but I want to ask you,
[00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.591]  How you broke into the industry, and how it is expressing yourself?
[00:30:14.871 --> 00:30:20.973]  Like, do you find that the music industry is as confined and that the government tries to control it as much as they try to control the movie industry?
[00:30:23.774 --> 00:30:38.260]  You know, right now I've decided to take the independent route, so I have an independent record label, Sidetrack Records, and we're going through ADA, which is Warner, but with major distribution, but they have no
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.181]  Uh, creative control whatsoever on what I do.
[00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:47.644]  And I feel like that is the route that, uh, real artists need to look into.
[00:30:47.904 --> 00:30:55.427]  Is to not sign to a major label, but to have an independent label, uh, and have their own control over their own destinies.
[00:30:55.487 --> 00:30:59.889]  Because if you sign to a major, they will tell you what you can sing, what you cannot sing.
[00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:03.231]  Oh yeah, I've been approached by Universal and people with my films.
[00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:05.732]  And, uh, I said no.
[00:31:06.373 --> 00:31:07.954]  Because, I mean, take Jesse Ventura.
[00:31:07.974 --> 00:31:10.315]  They gave him a three million dollar a year contract for three years.
[00:31:10.795 --> 00:31:11.596]  Nine million dollars.
[00:31:12.717 --> 00:31:14.138]  And, uh, with MSNBC.
[00:31:14.298 --> 00:31:15.559]  And then he wasn't thinking.
[00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:18.180]  As soon as he went in, they said, basically, you're not going to cover anything you want.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.400]  Yep.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.461]  No anti-war.
[00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:22.963]  They had hired him right at the start of the war just to muzzle him.
[00:31:23.344 --> 00:31:24.985]  So he left with the money and went and surfed.
[00:31:25.805 --> 00:31:27.586]  And then now he's back because he can speak.
[00:31:27.626 --> 00:31:28.567]  The contract said he couldn't.
[00:31:28.587 --> 00:31:28.687]  Right.
[00:31:28.707 --> 00:31:30.948]  He couldn't do any media interviews, couldn't write books.
[00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.589]  Selling your soul.
[00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:37.974]  Yeah, and literally, but he got his soul back and went public here on the air with 9-11 Truth.
[00:31:37.994 --> 00:31:39.275]  That's great.
[00:31:39.876 --> 00:31:41.778]  Millie, anything else?
[00:31:41.978 --> 00:31:46.281]  Yeah, just one last question, and I want to plug a charity, but what advice do you have for me?
[00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:49.224]  Like, you broke into the mainstream, so people knew your name.
[00:31:49.344 --> 00:31:51.706]  So, I mean, you could sell, like, the alternative music.
[00:31:51.746 --> 00:31:53.387]  See, like, I haven't broken in yet.
[00:31:53.488 --> 00:31:57.471]  So what advice would you have for me to try to break it into the mainstream and then go independent?
[00:31:58.052 --> 00:32:02.516]  Or try to go independent and then just promote myself as much as possible?
[00:32:02.536 --> 00:32:03.176]  What would you say?
[00:32:03.537 --> 00:32:10.062]  Well, if you go into a major, what they do is they hold you up for many, many, many, many years like they did with me.
[00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:12.264]  They don't let you record with anyone else.
[00:32:12.284 --> 00:32:13.965]  They don't let you release your music.
[00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:15.807]  You're not free to do that.
[00:32:16.447 --> 00:32:19.410]  So it takes years and years and years to get out of the slavery.
[00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:24.314]  Yeah, put your music out for free on the internet, and if it's good, you will have success.
[00:32:24.374 --> 00:32:27.757]  So many people want, I'm not saying you're saying this, but they want instant success.
[00:32:27.797 --> 00:32:34.924]  I mean, I've worked for free in radio the first few years, then I got $200 a week, then I got $400 a week, and then I started, you know, my own films and things.
[00:32:34.944 --> 00:32:42.090]  But the first few years, I literally, you know, had to go have other jobs, you know, working at an auto parts store or whatever.
[00:32:42.511 --> 00:32:45.874]  And then I hire these college kids and people, you know, young adults,
[00:32:46.634 --> 00:32:46.734]  I'm
[00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:02.630]  Hello Amy.
[00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:04.512]  What type of songs do you mostly sing about?
[00:33:29.995 --> 00:33:38.684]  Um, mostly, uh, well, I've spent a lot of years screaming about, um, political, um, you know, our rights, basically.
[00:33:39.024 --> 00:33:45.351]  Um, but, uh, this particular record is, especially after my assault, is more of an introspective, spiritual journey.
[00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.354]  Um, reggae makes me happy and
[00:33:49.034 --> 00:33:50.996]  It's just about, it's a spiritual journey.
[00:33:51.016 --> 00:34:03.404]  Did you hear the clip earlier about the private fellow reserve, the CIA, the new world order, I mean that's the kind of stuff she's, and millions and millions of views, and I've been very very successful.
[00:34:03.544 --> 00:34:04.245]  Go ahead.
[00:34:04.365 --> 00:34:08.067]  Do you sing anything about pro-guns, Amy?
[00:34:08.327 --> 00:34:10.409]  Anything about the gun culture, anything like that?
[00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:18.498]  Um, I do have a song, yeah, I do have a song on the record actually about that, but yeah.
[00:34:18.518 --> 00:34:33.962]  Briefly, I don't like, I don't have a whole song about it, but I, you know, all of my work is part of me in it, so yes, I believe in... The gun culture is a big issue, Amy, right now in the small town of Versailles, Missouri, that's where Dave and Joyce Riley have their Power Hour show.
[00:34:33.982 --> 00:34:39.723]  A friend of mine told me last night, he called me and said the teachers in Versailles School
[00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:49.924]  Or teaching the kids that guns are bad and making them write essays on it in their class work now, and then they're telling it's bad for kids to hunt and mom and dad to go out and hunt.
[00:34:50.484 --> 00:34:54.485]  No, no, the public schools, when you put your children in school, you lose them.
[00:34:55.086 --> 00:34:57.887]  And most of the major private schools follow the same curricula.
[00:34:57.927 --> 00:34:59.787]  They teach you, your parents are bad.
[00:34:59.807 --> 00:35:05.149]  I mean, I have Time Magazine for kids, saying your parents are stupid and backwards, you're going to take a chip, you're cool.
[00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:06.950]  I mean, that's almost a quote.
[00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:07.790]  That's paraphrasing.
[00:35:08.311 --> 00:35:10.632]  And it's there to brainwash.
[00:35:10.732 --> 00:35:11.992]  College is the same thing.
[00:35:12.533 --> 00:35:19.957]  It doesn't matter what class it is, you are paying to be lied to and be brainwashed by a bunch of government-funded parasites, on average.
[00:35:20.517 --> 00:35:21.978]  And you can't homeschool them now.
[00:35:22.498 --> 00:35:27.560]  Oh yeah, now all over they're trying to claim it's illegal, ordering people to put their kids in public schools.
[00:35:27.961 --> 00:35:29.021]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.082]  Stan, that's outrageous.
[00:35:30.102 --> 00:35:31.302]  Get me some documentation on it.
[00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:34.164]  I know it's going on, but even there in small town Missouri.
[00:35:34.184 --> 00:35:34.484]  Thank you.
[00:35:34.844 --> 00:35:36.745]  And Anthony in New York, you're on the air.
[00:35:36.765 --> 00:35:37.485]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:42.728]  Yeah, I was just wondering what are Amy's favorite bands right now?
[00:35:42.928 --> 00:35:49.271]  And she was talking about how her mom sort of woke her up or talked to her about the New World Order when she was younger.
[00:35:50.061 --> 00:35:55.665]  I was just wondering how her mother woke up and how she sort of took the red pill.
[00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:56.666]  I'll take my answer off there.
[00:35:57.106 --> 00:36:00.269]  Thanks, guys.
[00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:02.530]  I don't know how my mom did, actually.
[00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.192]  I have to ask her that.
[00:36:04.312 --> 00:36:04.672]  I don't know.
[00:36:04.752 --> 00:36:07.654]  She's just always been that way, but I'll find that out.
[00:36:07.674 --> 00:36:09.856]  What was the other question?
[00:36:11.158 --> 00:36:13.920]  He was just asking, I think... Oh, what bands I listen to.
[00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:30.795]  Actually, music, since it's my job, and it's what I do, and I do it all day, every day, when I have a free moment, I listen to Alex, or I listen to George and Ori on Coast to Coast AM, and I read a lot, so I'm not...
[00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:31.796]  You read?
[00:36:32.136 --> 00:36:35.218]  I'm surprised reading isn't in this document.
[00:36:35.258 --> 00:36:38.720]  It says community service means you're a terrorist, but it's not for Obama.
[00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:40.421]  You read, folks?
[00:36:40.461 --> 00:36:42.223]  We got one that can read.
[00:36:42.843 --> 00:36:43.443]  Are you violent?
[00:36:44.664 --> 00:36:45.265]  Total terrorist.
[00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:46.425]  Whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.
[00:36:46.986 --> 00:36:48.327]  I got something for you to read right here.
[00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:51.469]  You know, you get arrested sometimes having one of these.
[00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.130]  You know what this is?
[00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.131]  A pocket constitution?
[00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:54.571]  Yeah.
[00:36:55.371 --> 00:36:55.992]  Paraphernalia.
[00:36:56.572 --> 00:36:57.153]  Propaganda.
[00:36:57.173 --> 00:36:57.593]  That's right.
[00:36:57.893 --> 00:36:58.714]  It's what they call it.
[00:36:58.734 --> 00:37:00.175]  This is paraphernalia.
[00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:06.976]  We had a private detective on a few days ago where they pulled him over and he had one of these and they just said, buddy, you're going to jail.
[00:37:07.516 --> 00:37:10.358]  They were like, having this doesn't go good for you, boy.
[00:37:10.378 --> 00:37:12.418]  He even knows how to read it!
[00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:23.764]  My friend actually, amazing you brought that up, my friend, my co-producer on this album, got pulled over by the police and he had a Bible on his front seat in Indiana.
[00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:26.685]  He had a Bible and the guy said, what are you doing with that?
[00:37:26.865 --> 00:37:29.346]  And he said, it's a Bible, my mom gave it to me.
[00:37:29.786 --> 00:37:30.146]  And he goes,
[00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:34.928]  Yeah, anyone having a Bible in their car, there's probably a gun.
[00:37:34.948 --> 00:37:35.869]  Do you have any guns on you?
[00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:36.809]  And he goes, what?
[00:37:37.189 --> 00:37:38.870]  No, I don't have any guns on me.
[00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.972]  And he's like, yeah, well, you just don't seem like you can be trusted.
[00:37:42.992 --> 00:37:44.092]  And started giving him a hard time.
[00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:45.493]  He was just absolutely shocked.
[00:37:45.573 --> 00:37:46.533]  Where did this happen?
[00:37:46.673 --> 00:37:47.173]  In Indiana.
[00:37:47.614 --> 00:37:50.035]  Okay, well, you see, this is what happens.
[00:37:50.095 --> 00:37:51.835]  I get on air and people say I exaggerate.
[00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:52.676]  It's the opposite.
[00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:54.737]  We broke the MIAC report last week.
[00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:57.938]  It's all over CNN, Fox, Rush Limbaugh.
[00:37:57.998 --> 00:37:59.118]  Of course, none of them getting his credit.
[00:37:59.458 --> 00:38:00.299]  AP, everywhere.
[00:38:01.457 --> 00:38:06.922]  And then just sitting here, I start remembering, wait a minute, remember in San Francisco the Feds put out a report?
[00:38:07.322 --> 00:38:10.064]  It broke in San Francisco, it was nationwide, four years ago.
[00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:15.348]  And it said if they have a road atlas, which my car has,
[00:38:16.443 --> 00:38:22.064]  As if you're going to have a road atlas on the road, you know, that they're selling gas stations and truck stops, that that's a sign you're a terrorist.
[00:38:22.144 --> 00:38:24.065]  Cell phones, blue jeans.
[00:38:24.205 --> 00:38:27.325]  I've got the Texas report coming in here that's even worse than the MIAC report.
[00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:31.126]  And see, I'm on air not even trying to demonize them.
[00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:35.587]  It's many times worse than I can even cover because we've got all these reports.
[00:38:35.707 --> 00:38:38.808]  And I've seen reports where it says, if they have a Bible.
[00:38:39.968 --> 00:38:45.929]  So see, and then there was another report in the Associated Press about it, right after 9-11, it was like, a woman with a baby carriage, maybe Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:46.952 --> 00:38:47.593]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:38:47.673 --> 00:38:50.357]  And they're going to have neighborhood watch groups.
[00:38:50.417 --> 00:38:54.081]  Folks, so how did this end with the evil Bible?
[00:38:55.013 --> 00:39:00.075]  Um, the evil Bible, he let him go, but he harassed him for a long time, made him get out of the car.
[00:39:00.095 --> 00:39:04.077]  Um, uh, he said he wanted to search the vehicle.
[00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:06.378]  My friend said, you don't have a right to.
[00:39:06.458 --> 00:39:10.200]  And it just went back and forth and really, really harassed him.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.581]  And he said, well, I'm going to call the department and tell them that he harassed me because I had a Bible.
[00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.862]  And I said, well, you really should.
[00:39:15.902 --> 00:39:17.383]  And he was shocked.
[00:39:17.423 --> 00:39:20.664]  And I said, well, here's a couple of websites so that you're not shocked by this.
[00:39:20.684 --> 00:39:22.005]  You can kind of understand what's going on.
[00:39:22.685 --> 00:39:24.987]  I've turned him on to your show, and he's pretty stoked.
[00:39:25.848 --> 00:39:29.991]  Well, we'd like him to call in sometime if he can get in, or email robd at infowars.com.
[00:39:30.032 --> 00:39:33.334]  We'd like to hear more of those stories from people, especially the documented ones.
[00:39:33.374 --> 00:39:36.057]  I mean, ladies in Las Vegas get pulled over by the cops.
[00:39:36.077 --> 00:39:36.898]  They shoot video of it.
[00:39:36.918 --> 00:39:37.398]  It's like, why?
[00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:38.719]  There's a Ron Paul sticker here, ma'am.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.100]  Why do you have this?
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.623]  I mean, because they believe they've found al-Qaeda.
[00:39:44.019 --> 00:39:46.841]  They really believe this.
[00:39:47.642 --> 00:39:49.623]  Folks, police, that's why the elite are criminal.
[00:39:49.903 --> 00:39:56.227]  We're the good guys exposing the criminals and they think you're stupid and they tell you we're cop killers.
[00:39:56.247 --> 00:39:59.008]  That's what the whole first page says of the report.
[00:40:00.149 --> 00:40:01.270]  I don't know when it's going to end.
[00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.531]  I feel like this is just the beginning.
[00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:03.891]  I don't know how far it's going to go.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.942]  Their own version of the star, David, and start shipping us off to camps, I guess.
[00:40:11.182 --> 00:40:13.904]  Yeah, well, you know, that's what we've got to do for America to keep us safe.
[00:40:14.524 --> 00:40:16.586]  Anthony in New York, you're on the air, Anthony.
[00:40:19.507 --> 00:40:20.348]  Oh, we just went to Anthony.
[00:40:20.388 --> 00:40:21.809]  I can't keep track of these callers anymore.
[00:40:21.869 --> 00:40:22.990]  Pat in New York, go ahead.
[00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.870]  There's two New York calls.
[00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:24.530]  Hey, Pat.
[00:40:24.571 --> 00:40:27.132]  I just want to say thank you to you and Amy for doing a good job.
[00:40:27.392 --> 00:40:28.313]  Patriots, thank you.
[00:40:28.693 --> 00:40:29.734]  Well, she can read, though.
[00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.235]  That's a sign of Al Qaeda.
[00:40:31.635 --> 00:40:32.315]  Very suspicious.
[00:40:33.236 --> 00:40:34.857]  Yeah, she looks as good as she sounds, too.
[00:40:35.786 --> 00:40:35.986]  Thank you.
[00:40:36.366 --> 00:40:37.507]  Well, I just wanted to move on.
[00:40:37.527 --> 00:40:40.309]  I want to try to... So put the camera on her instead of me.
[00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.769]  Hold on.
[00:40:40.809 --> 00:40:41.509]  Yeah, over there.
[00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:42.090]  Go ahead.
[00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.931]  I wanted to let you know about Local Law A for Albany County.
[00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:45.972]  They're trying to sneak this through.
[00:40:46.012 --> 00:40:48.073]  It says, Regulating the Purchase of Ammunition.
[00:40:48.793 --> 00:40:52.155]  And what it is, when you start reading this, it's on albanycounty.com.
[00:40:52.816 --> 00:40:55.117]  Right on their website, you go to local legislature.
[00:40:55.677 --> 00:40:57.839]  And here, I'm just going to read Section 5 real quick.
[00:40:58.779 --> 00:41:05.403]  A record shall be kept by the dealer of each sale of ammunition, which shall show the type, caliber, and quantity of ammunition sold.
[00:41:05.816 --> 00:41:13.742]  The name and address of the person receiving the same, the caliber, make, model, manufacturer's name, and serial number of the firearm for which the purchaser
[00:41:14.221 --> 00:41:15.362]  is purchasing ammunition.
[00:41:15.782 --> 00:41:16.203]  Oh my God!
[00:41:16.243 --> 00:41:16.563]  Stop!
[00:41:16.603 --> 00:41:16.943]  Stop!
[00:41:16.963 --> 00:41:17.263]  Stop!
[00:41:17.303 --> 00:41:17.604]  Stop!
[00:41:17.644 --> 00:41:17.844]  Stop!
[00:41:17.864 --> 00:41:18.664]  I'm going to hold you over.
[00:41:18.965 --> 00:41:19.485]  Red alert!
[00:41:19.585 --> 00:41:20.045]  Red alert!
[00:41:20.126 --> 00:41:20.986]  Call Paul Watson.
[00:41:21.026 --> 00:41:21.647]  Call Curt Nema.
[00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:23.088]  I want to talk to them during the break.
[00:41:23.348 --> 00:41:24.849]  This is why we're always ahead of everybody else.
[00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:26.871]  Because our listeners give us all the tips.
[00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:27.391]  And you watch.
[00:41:27.411 --> 00:41:28.111]  We're going to go look at this.
[00:41:28.131 --> 00:41:28.652]  It's going to be real.
[00:41:28.672 --> 00:41:30.874]  Because the feds everywhere are pushing.
[00:41:30.934 --> 00:41:32.415]  And you hear about stimulus package.
[00:41:32.435 --> 00:41:33.556]  They tell the counties and cities.
[00:41:33.576 --> 00:41:34.676]  We're going to give you this money.
[00:41:34.716 --> 00:41:35.857]  But we want you to build a FEMA center.
[00:41:35.917 --> 00:41:36.077]  Right.
[00:41:36.218 --> 00:41:37.859]  We want you to move the army in with your police.
[00:41:37.919 --> 00:41:38.699]  This is now happening.
[00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:39.320]  Mainstream news.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.742]  And we want you to start with regulations
[00:41:42.302 --> 00:41:52.168]  Not a law, just having the local county order the gun dealers and Walmart and whatever to write down who got ammo for a gun registration deal.
[00:41:52.208 --> 00:41:53.569]  This is off the charts.
[00:41:53.809 --> 00:41:56.251]  AlbanyCounty.com, is this in New York?
[00:41:56.271 --> 00:41:59.172]  I'll give you the exact page on the information.
[00:41:59.192 --> 00:42:00.733]  Hold on, Bermas, you already know about this?
[00:42:01.294 --> 00:42:01.674]  What's that?
[00:42:02.194 --> 00:42:03.115]  Bermas says he already knows.
[00:42:04.833 --> 00:42:05.294]  It's right now.
[00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:25.221]  Okay, okay.
[00:42:25.561 --> 00:42:25.902]  Oh my God.
[00:42:26.142 --> 00:42:27.863]  Okay, I've got to... Guys, Google this right now.
[00:42:27.983 --> 00:42:29.123]  AlbanyCounty.com.
[00:42:29.163 --> 00:42:29.984]  Where is it on there?
[00:42:30.484 --> 00:42:33.866]  There's a Schenectady mayor considers options martial law over police woes.
[00:42:34.346 --> 00:42:36.107]  That's Capital News 9 out of Albany.
[00:42:36.407 --> 00:42:39.068]  Sir, where on the site is this new thing?
[00:42:39.148 --> 00:42:42.630]  You go AlbanyCounty.com slash department.
[00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:46.449]  Last legislature, last resolution.
[00:42:46.489 --> 00:42:46.689]  Stop!
[00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:47.150]  Stop!
[00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.930]  That's not how you get it.
[00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.191]  I need the name of the resolution.
[00:42:49.471 --> 00:42:50.232]  That'll take us right to it.
[00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:51.272]  What's the name of the resolution?
[00:42:51.713 --> 00:42:54.995]  Resolution 108, local law number A for 2009.
[00:42:55.355 --> 00:42:55.775]  Stay there.
[00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:56.676]  Give it to us during break.
[00:42:56.916 --> 00:42:57.236]  Mergens!
[00:43:13.507 --> 00:43:14.048]  I don't know.
[00:43:41.971 --> 00:43:45.633]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:45.673 --> 00:43:51.157]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:16.965]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:17.365 --> 00:44:19.187]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:19.347 --> 00:44:21.769]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:32.778]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:33.418 --> 00:44:34.719]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.461]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:36.937 --> 00:44:43.281]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:43.841 --> 00:44:51.626]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:53.247]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:53.687 --> 00:44:54.868]  The people strike back.
[00:44:56.974 --> 00:45:00.257]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:04.502]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:45:04.682 --> 00:45:12.650]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:13.350]  We're good to go!
[00:45:45.919 --> 00:45:46.721]  We're good.
[00:46:01.355 --> 00:46:06.862]  Okay, I got Paul Watson right now online.
[00:46:06.883 --> 00:46:10.087]  This is going to go mega huge and alert gun owners to all the gun grabbing.
[00:46:10.347 --> 00:46:13.671]  We've documented a nexus point in this area of New York.
[00:46:13.691 --> 00:46:17.456]  Now they're doing beta tests to have counties and cities restrict ammo and guns.
[00:46:18.577 --> 00:46:23.220]  Uh, if the caller is what he's saying true, the albanycounty.com is basically crashed right now.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.141]  We can't get on it.
[00:46:24.621 --> 00:46:30.505]  So, listener, if you have that page loaded, screenshot it and email it to robd, the letter d at infowars.com.
[00:46:30.945 --> 00:46:38.149]  Now, give us the coordinates for this, and this ties into Albany, New York, surrounding county, saying they want to have a federal martial law there.
[00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.990]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:44.751]  We just showed the mainstream news story on that, and we played a clip of it in the first hour.
[00:46:45.572 --> 00:46:56.994]  So, going back to Pat in New York, slowly, AlbanyCounty.com, you go there, what is the headline on the bill or law or whatever this is?
[00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:57.714]  Tell us specifics.
[00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:08.617]  Alright, this is called Local Law Number A. For the county, and it says, that's exactly what the top says, it says, Local Law of the County of Albany, New York, Regulating the Purchase of Ammunition in the County of Albany.
[00:47:09.071 --> 00:47:10.112]  Introduced 3-9-0-9.
[00:47:10.312 --> 00:47:15.417]  I went up there on 3-9-0-9, I said it was unconstitutional and everything, but... I guess they got moved.
[00:47:15.457 --> 00:47:16.478]  They're trying to push it through.
[00:47:16.498 --> 00:47:18.279]  They're trying to push it through Law Committee Monday.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.302]  And then, uh... This is a county law, though, not a state.
[00:47:21.642 --> 00:47:23.304]  Yeah, but they're gonna start... It's a precedent.
[00:47:23.364 --> 00:47:25.746]  They're gonna start in Albany County... No, no, no, I understand.
[00:47:25.766 --> 00:47:27.948]  Let me stop you, because that's the county where the Capitol resides.
[00:47:29.872 --> 00:47:30.192]  Correct?
[00:47:30.612 --> 00:47:30.792]  Yes.
[00:47:31.372 --> 00:47:32.913]  I'm just picking your brain here quick on air.
[00:47:33.373 --> 00:47:36.994]  Okay, slowly, because I've got Paul Watson listening right now.
[00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:38.854]  They're moving nationwide, Paul, as you know.
[00:47:39.855 --> 00:47:40.635]  He's our quick writer.
[00:47:41.375 --> 00:47:45.136]  To restrict ammo, and that's what the big gun sites have said, that's the new move.
[00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:48.977]  This thing, demonizing gun owners, says they've got to stamp all the bullets or you're a cop killer.
[00:47:49.657 --> 00:47:51.838]  That's in here on page 3.
[00:47:53.958 --> 00:47:57.459]  Right there, see stamping the bullet with your, basically your ID on it.
[00:47:57.919 --> 00:48:00.019]  Give it to us again, AlbanyCounty.com.
[00:48:00.399 --> 00:48:00.720]  Yeah.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.560]  And give us all the subsections.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.800]  Law Aid.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.861]  I'll give you the webpage, I can give you the link that will bring you right to the PDF file they have.
[00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:09.521]  Okay.
[00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:17.043]  And it's Albany County, you know, H-T-T-P-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W
[00:48:22.363 --> 00:48:23.484]  Slash resolutions.
[00:48:25.625 --> 00:48:27.225]  Uh-huh.
[00:48:27.246 --> 00:48:29.507]  Slash 2009.
[00:48:29.727 --> 00:48:31.087]  Mm-hmm.
[00:48:31.107 --> 00:48:32.868]  Slash 2009-0309.
[00:48:34.129 --> 00:48:34.729]  Slash 09.
[00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:37.771]  What is that thing there, Dan?
[00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:39.072]  Nobody's going to get that.
[00:48:39.092 --> 00:48:43.534]  Just slowly give me the exact headline on the PDF and that will pull it.
[00:48:43.874 --> 00:48:47.136]  We now have it?
[00:48:47.156 --> 00:48:48.476]  Okay, give us the headline, sir.
[00:48:48.997 --> 00:48:51.358]  The headline just says local law number
[00:48:52.315 --> 00:48:52.795]  Period.
[00:48:52.935 --> 00:48:53.295]  Space.
[00:48:53.395 --> 00:48:54.816]  And quotations A for 2009.
[00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:57.356]  Okay, Albany, New York.
[00:48:57.416 --> 00:48:59.116]  Okay, that will help us find it.
[00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:02.317]  You want to email that page right now to Rob Dugas.
[00:49:02.357 --> 00:49:05.418]  It's not loading here for us because I guess millions are going to check it out.
[00:49:06.518 --> 00:49:09.219]  So email that to us right now and thank you so much.
[00:49:09.659 --> 00:49:10.339]  What is it, Rob?
[00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:14.100]  Rob, R-O-B-D, at Infowars.com.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.380]  At Infowars?
[00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:16.881]  Will do!
[00:49:31.425 --> 00:49:31.965]  Well, we love it.
[00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:33.466]  We just love exposing these bastards.
[00:49:33.486 --> 00:49:34.646]  Look at this Texas report.
[00:49:34.666 --> 00:49:35.686]  I'd forgotten about this one.
[00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:42.468]  We're the ones that scanned this and put this on the web, and then Jim Mars, years later, comes back and reminds me of it and brought a copy in today.
[00:49:42.488 --> 00:49:58.373]  This was out of Austin, Texas, and this says, you know, this is almost as bad as this report, and it says, groups that are involved in community service, public rallies, demonstrations, private meetings sponsored by support groups, posters, leaflets, websites, and underground press publications as a sign of terrorism.
[00:49:58.993 --> 00:50:00.375]  Says, how do terrorists gain support?
[00:50:00.395 --> 00:50:06.604]  And then it basically lists scuba training, cell phones, just everything.
[00:50:06.624 --> 00:50:07.505]  We're just all terrorists.
[00:50:08.266 --> 00:50:09.908]  It says walking, biking, or driving.
[00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:11.741]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:12.301]  I'm reading.
[00:50:12.321 --> 00:50:13.902]  I can give you the phone numbers here.
[00:50:14.082 --> 00:50:15.662]  See, folks think I'm exaggerating.
[00:50:15.762 --> 00:50:19.484]  I can't remember all I've learned, all I've seen, all we've documented.
[00:50:19.924 --> 00:50:24.785]  I mean, it's just... I've been mailed hundreds of these by police and military over the years.
[00:50:25.285 --> 00:50:29.987]  And this one, they had a public symposium, and locals went to it and videotaped the whole thing.
[00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:34.888]  So somewhere around here, we have the whole videotape of them teaching this to a huge crowd of people.
[00:50:34.908 --> 00:50:39.209]  Stay with us.
[00:50:39.229 --> 00:50:40.390]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:05.262]  If you simply prepare.

[00:51:08.724 --> 00:51:15.608]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[00:51:35.686 --> 00:51:36.127]  Take action today.
[00:51:36.147 --> 00:51:38.129]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:49.668 --> 00:51:51.549]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:52.049 --> 00:51:54.890]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:55.851]  Initiate!
[00:52:04.015 --> 00:52:07.236]  Man, this show has blasted past faster than anything I can ever remember.
[00:52:07.276 --> 00:52:08.517]  We're already three hours in.
[00:52:08.997 --> 00:52:10.358]  Final hour, jam-packed.
[00:52:10.398 --> 00:52:15.020]  Jim Mars, next segment in studio for 52 minutes with us today.
[00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:20.062]  And everything we've ever talked about is now just being flaunted in our face.
[00:52:20.482 --> 00:52:20.942]  I have it.
[00:52:22.142 --> 00:52:24.643]  Registering anybody to buy bullets, keeping records of them.
[00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:25.783]  Absolute high tyranny.
[00:52:26.163 --> 00:52:30.884]  Feds making their move in upstate New York for total takeover and martial law.
[00:52:30.924 --> 00:52:34.945]  Put the martial law headline up as they prepare martial law in that area.
[00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:39.646]  I will now be attacked by national news saying it doesn't exist even though it's mainstream news.
[00:52:40.607 --> 00:52:45.048]  Then next week they will announce it's all true, but Glenn Beck will say he's our friend and maybe it's needed.
[00:52:45.528 --> 00:52:45.688]  Right.
[00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:54.558]  But, uh, local law number A for 2009, a local law for the County of Albany, New York, regulating the purchase of ammunition in the County of Albany.
[00:52:54.999 --> 00:52:57.883]  So they are moving, and moving everywhere with similar things.
[00:52:58.624 --> 00:53:02.109]  Uh, the jail time, thousand dollar fines, um, how's that sound?
[00:53:05.507 --> 00:53:07.570]  It sounds, you know, typical.
[00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:10.955]  It sounds like, I feel like this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:53:10.975 --> 00:53:12.156]  This is just the beginning.
[00:53:12.637 --> 00:53:16.562]  What you were saying during the break, the good news is you have a lot of military contacting you on your MySpace.
[00:53:16.602 --> 00:53:20.267]  Give out some of your websites, your MySpace, and talk about the troops and people that are contacting you.
[00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:25.350]  I have MySpace.com backslash Amy Allen is a good way to contact me.
[00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:27.451]  AmyAllen.com is another one.
[00:53:28.131 --> 00:53:35.415]  But yeah, I do have a lot of police that contact me and a lot of military personnel, soldiers, and they say, let's organize.
[00:53:36.775 --> 00:53:37.416]  We got the guns.
[00:53:37.796 --> 00:53:38.456]  Let's get together.
[00:53:39.196 --> 00:53:40.737]  Let's take back our country.
[00:53:41.177 --> 00:53:49.582]  And they don't, you know, they'll give phone numbers or private emails, but there is a definite movement within our military to not accept
[00:53:50.802 --> 00:53:58.004]  They took an oath to defend the Constitution and they're not going to lay down and die unless it's for this country.
[00:53:58.044 --> 00:54:02.665]  But these scumbag parasite bureaucrats that work for the offshore banks, they just can't help it.
[00:54:02.685 --> 00:54:03.946]  They hate the fact we're armed.
[00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:05.306]  They hate the fact we have wealth.
[00:54:05.606 --> 00:54:06.706]  They are control freak.
[00:54:06.766 --> 00:54:08.767]  Everybody's known control freak scum in their lives.
[00:54:09.347 --> 00:54:11.568]  Well, control freak scum try to get in positions of power.
[00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:14.749]  They love ruling over us and I got news for you, you bastards.
[00:54:14.769 --> 00:54:15.669]  You're not going to get away with it.
[00:54:16.129 --> 00:54:18.010]  And they want to kill us, most importantly.
[00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:24.973]  Well, yeah, the people running things are eugenicists, and it's just, it's all getting more and more insane.
[00:54:25.233 --> 00:54:29.335]  So, are you playing anywhere else while you're in town in Austin for South by Southwest?
[00:54:29.595 --> 00:54:35.557]  No, I played three shows yesterday and the day before, and now it's just time for me to enjoy Austin and hang out.
[00:54:35.577 --> 00:54:40.339]  Well, at least we got a plug in two nights ago when you were on Jason Burma's Infowars show from 9 to midnight, so that's good.
[00:54:40.379 --> 00:54:41.200]  Yeah, that's really great.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.261]  I told anyone who listened to the show to come down and they get a free drink, so.
[00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:46.342]  Well, I had a few listeners that came down.
[00:54:46.362 --> 00:54:54.767]  Wow, so I'm just excited to have you here, and I appreciate you coming into the studio, and you were telling me during the break you might move to Austin.
[00:54:55.427 --> 00:54:56.188]  I'm thinking about it.
[00:54:57.088 --> 00:55:01.851]  You know, I feel like I need to get out of California, and this would be a good spot.
[00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:05.213]  Everybody I know in California is talking about getting out of California.
[00:55:05.413 --> 00:55:05.633]  Right?
[00:55:05.793 --> 00:55:11.817]  Well, you know, if things go down and there's martial law, I feel like Texas would be a good, safe place to be, you know?
[00:55:13.407 --> 00:55:14.227]  A lot safer than California.
[00:55:14.387 --> 00:55:15.588]  Well, especially Austin.
[00:55:15.628 --> 00:55:18.509]  We've done our due diligence here, planting the seeds of liberty everywhere.
[00:55:18.609 --> 00:55:18.789]  Yeah.
[00:55:19.269 --> 00:55:22.970]  And so, we're pretty much the majority here of people who can think.
[00:55:23.751 --> 00:55:24.911]  They're on the team, so.
[00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:27.852]  And yeah, the weather's nicer here than Montana, so.
[00:55:29.033 --> 00:55:29.873]  It's a little cold up there.
[00:55:30.748 --> 00:55:32.489]  Oh, so you've also thought about going back to Montana?
[00:55:32.989 --> 00:55:33.689]  Well, yeah.
[00:55:33.769 --> 00:55:38.632]  I mean, they didn't have a speed limit for the longest time, but until the Fed imposed one.
[00:55:38.792 --> 00:55:39.412]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:55:39.432 --> 00:55:43.834]  I love driving 110 miles an hour right past state troopers and nothing happens.
[00:55:43.934 --> 00:55:44.214]  Yeah.
[00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.214]  But now they'll get you, huh?
[00:55:45.254 --> 00:55:47.395]  Well, the Fed imposed, they said you have to have a speed limit.
[00:55:47.415 --> 00:55:50.177]  So cops now, you know, it's a $20 fine if you speed.
[00:55:50.977 --> 00:55:53.738]  My sister told me yesterday, she's like, I got a ticket.
[00:55:53.758 --> 00:55:55.139]  And I said, can I pay you now?
[00:55:55.459 --> 00:55:55.879]  He said, yeah, $20.
[00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:57.260]  She goes, here's $40.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.180]  Call your buddies.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.381]  I'm going to be flying down.
[00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:03.463]  So, I mean, Montana's just a little different than California.
[00:56:03.483 --> 00:56:05.224]  Yeah, we need people like that here in Texas.
[00:56:05.244 --> 00:56:07.546]  Now, Texas has got a lot of tyranny as well.
[00:56:07.626 --> 00:56:08.266]  It's not perfect.
[00:56:08.646 --> 00:56:12.308]  Amy Allen's new album, A Little Happiness, when's it come out?
[00:56:13.009 --> 00:56:13.509]  June 9th.
[00:56:14.189 --> 00:56:14.510]  Everywhere.
[00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.351]  June 9th, so we're only talking about a month or so, a month and a half.
[00:56:17.872 --> 00:56:17.992]  Yeah.
[00:56:18.012 --> 00:56:19.473]  Okay, there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:19.993 --> 00:56:21.274]  And be sure and check it out again.
[00:56:21.314 --> 00:56:23.035]  Fire out those websites one more time for folks.
[00:56:23.723 --> 00:56:30.705]  AimeeAllen.com, A-I-M-E-E Allen, A-L-L-E-N.com and MySpace.com backslash Aimee Allen.
[00:56:31.045 --> 00:56:37.027]  Alright, Aimee Allen, fabulous having a fellow patriot in the fight for liberty, getting the word out through music.
[00:56:37.487 --> 00:56:39.768]  We really salute you and appreciate you and Godspeed.
[00:56:39.848 --> 00:56:40.228]  Thank you.
[00:56:40.248 --> 00:56:41.008]  Thank you for having me.
[00:56:41.906 --> 00:56:42.867]  Good to have her here with us.
[00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:47.531]  Jim Mars, ladies and gentlemen, in that seat in three minutes when we get back.
[00:56:47.611 --> 00:56:54.437]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Obama Deception is now out on DVD.
[00:56:54.497 --> 00:56:55.658]  Get it and get it out, folks.
[00:56:55.698 --> 00:56:56.478]  The InfoWar!
[00:56:57.319 --> 00:57:00.261]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:57:00.422 --> 00:57:05.666]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:57:05.926 --> 00:57:11.290]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:12.771]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:13.132 --> 00:57:22.039]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:24.081]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:28.466]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:57:28.506 --> 00:57:33.131]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:57:33.512 --> 00:57:35.174]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:57:37.396 --> 00:57:39.337]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:58:00.729 --> 00:58:02.874]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:10.372]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:17.113]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:17.513 --> 00:58:19.354]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:19.494 --> 00:58:21.895]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:21.995 --> 00:58:32.939]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:33.559 --> 00:58:34.839]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:35.239 --> 00:58:36.600]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:43.434]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:43.994 --> 00:58:51.797]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:52.258 --> 00:58:53.398]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:53.838 --> 00:58:55.019]  The people strike back.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:00.683]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[00:59:01.023 --> 00:59:04.305]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[00:59:04.665 --> 00:59:08.047]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[00:59:08.488 --> 00:59:10.769]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.280]  I think so.
[00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.073]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:00.653 --> 01:00:03.517]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:10.324]  We are back live for the next 52 minutes in studio.
[01:00:10.344 --> 01:00:13.368]  The one, the only, Jim Mars is here.
[01:00:13.388 --> 01:00:14.869]  And I remember
[01:00:17.199 --> 01:00:23.744]  Was it four years ago, breaking this and doing a story up on InfoWars.com, and I told you I'd forgotten about hundreds of these.
[01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:31.330]  And he goes, look at this, Alex, you know the thing going on with MIAC in Missouri, which the governor now says he backs and the feds put out.
[01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.032]  He says the feds will continue to put these out to the state level.
[01:00:34.052 --> 01:00:35.713]  Terrorism, what the public needs to know.
[01:00:36.194 --> 01:00:37.935]  And I'd forgotten how bad this was.
[01:00:37.995 --> 01:00:40.217]  It's actually, in many respects, worse than the MIAC.
[01:00:40.757 --> 01:00:45.341]  It says, intelligence gathering practices, walking, biking, or driving near potential targets.
[01:00:45.361 --> 01:00:46.442]  That's why they harass you anywhere.
[01:00:47.062 --> 01:00:50.965]  Wearing a specific valid reason may create surveillance.
[01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:51.766]  Trial runs.
[01:00:52.626 --> 01:00:59.932]  It says, attend, practice in or practice a spiritual indoctrination, prepare for financial or fanatical self-sacrifice.
[01:01:00.713 --> 01:01:08.880]  Scuba, public rallies, demonstrations and private meetings sponsored by support groups, posters, leaflets, websites, underground press.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.541]  How do terrorists gain support is what they have here.
[01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:18.224]  And they go through, trained to avoid confrontations with law enforcement, and therefore can be expected to project a nice guy image.
[01:01:18.564 --> 01:01:22.045]  They have another area in here where they talk about, you know, they're involved in community things.
[01:01:22.065 --> 01:01:23.466]  They want to be involved in government.
[01:01:23.906 --> 01:01:26.007]  They're constitutionalists.
[01:01:26.907 --> 01:01:28.088]  They're into the Second Amendment.
[01:01:28.948 --> 01:01:33.170]  Cameras and surveillance equipment, baby formulas, cigarettes, beer, wine, liquor.
[01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.411]  And they travel with women and children.
[01:01:35.832 --> 01:01:36.232]  That's right.
[01:01:36.252 --> 01:01:39.414]  It says they travel with women and children.
[01:01:40.675 --> 01:01:42.396]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:01:42.596 --> 01:01:44.077]  And are polite to police.
[01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:47.159]  It says, who are the terrorists?
[01:01:47.179 --> 01:01:47.660]  It says right here.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.141]  We're going to put that up on screen.
[01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:50.642]  I have a scan of that, don't we?
[01:01:50.942 --> 01:01:53.704]  On the front page, down below the Texas seal, it says, introduction.
[01:01:55.105 --> 01:01:57.026]  And it says, who are the terrorists?
[01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:59.148]  I guess they're public rallies and people like that.
[01:01:59.188 --> 01:02:00.088]  Jim Mars, good to see you.
[01:02:00.108 --> 01:02:00.729]  Tell us about this.
[01:02:02.042 --> 01:02:03.943]  Well, this is, of course, been ongoing.
[01:02:03.963 --> 01:02:08.946]  This is, as you said, you had this a few years ago, and I had people send it to me.
[01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:18.871]  It's just absolutely incredible that the police are being trained to, I mean, there's always been a cop mentality, okay?
[01:02:18.931 --> 01:02:27.456]  And I understand this because for about a dozen years I was a police reporter, and this is back in the days of the old republic, when I actually ran with the cops.
[01:02:27.596 --> 01:02:28.517]  I mean, it was amazing.
[01:02:29.497 --> 01:02:33.718]  Snappy brim hat, and sometimes I actually carried my press card in my hat band.
[01:02:34.438 --> 01:02:37.618]  And I was good friends with the homicide detectives.
[01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:46.560]  They get a call on a murder and I just run out there with them and we'd go in the house and I'd step over the blood and the stuff and, you know, I'm right there.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:57.142]  And then what happened was, is that I suppose by the early 70s, radio got in on the act and you remember they started carrying those portable tape recorders, right?
[01:02:57.862 --> 01:03:17.434]  And so, next thing you know, instead of just one news reporter with a pad and pencil, now you've got five or six radio reporters with tape recorders, and it wasn't very long after that before all of a sudden TV showed up, and they had handheld wind-up cameras, and then pretty soon they had light people, and then they had... You were at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at the time.
[01:03:17.574 --> 01:03:17.854]  Right.
[01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:34.737]  And so, naturally, you couldn't let 20, 30 people and all their equipment into a crime scene, so they started keeping everybody outside the house, outside the building, and you had to wait until the police public information guy came out to tell you what was going on, and today, of course, now they string that
[01:03:35.257 --> 01:03:35.357]  Yes.
[01:03:50.762 --> 01:03:51.142]  I don't know.
[01:04:08.732 --> 01:04:09.132]  That's right.
[01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:13.774]  And says, by the way, here's a point, possession of global positioning systems.
[01:04:14.174 --> 01:04:14.574]  Okay?
[01:04:14.594 --> 01:04:17.815]  If you've got a GPS, you must be a terrorist.
[01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.275]  It's incredible, Alex.
[01:04:20.015 --> 01:04:24.317]  When I was a youngster, you know, back in the old days, we were taught to respect the police.
[01:04:24.397 --> 01:04:31.019]  And unfortunately, now it's getting to be them and us and them attitude, both on the part of the public
[01:04:31.559 --> 01:04:38.260]  Because they have been turned into so many things that are other than what I consider legitimate law enforcement.
[01:04:38.321 --> 01:04:40.821]  Well, let me just add, this is one of the public reports.
[01:04:40.941 --> 01:04:42.481]  Imagine how bad the secret ones are.
[01:04:42.501 --> 01:04:43.922]  Well, those are demonizing Ron Paul.
[01:04:43.942 --> 01:04:48.083]  You know, we have the secret reports, but that says what the public needs to know.
[01:04:48.123 --> 01:04:49.243]  We'll put it back up on screen.
[01:04:50.163 --> 01:04:52.024]  And I've seen some of the secret Texas reports.
[01:04:52.044 --> 01:04:54.104]  They're just as bad as this one out of Missouri.
[01:04:54.324 --> 01:05:15.375]  And let me tell you something, this goes back several years, but I broke a story while I was at Star Telegram about an airline pilot who had gone to a Dallas City Council meeting and had simply got up and asked some questions about the new proposed Comanche Peak power plant and a DPS undercover agent had gone back, filed a report, and checked it as subversive.
[01:05:15.815 --> 01:05:18.737]  And then they sent this report to the pilot's employer.
[01:05:19.577 --> 01:05:24.940]  Luckily for him, his employer happened to be a friend, and he said, look at this, they've got you down as a subversive.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:33.684]  Well, it's come out that pro-life groups, bike riding groups, anti-death penalty groups, they have state police in them trying to get them to carry out violence.
[01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:37.406]  I mean, mainline, now they have army intelligence spying on the people.
[01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:37.666]  Right.
[01:05:37.806 --> 01:05:40.107]  This is the opposite of what a free society is.
[01:05:40.467 --> 01:05:59.175]  Absolutely, and now that you mention these agents provocateur, I want to tell everybody that's listening to your show, if you're in any kind of group and somebody starts acting up and says, let's go beat up somebody or let's throw rocks through here, grab those people and get them out of there because violence is, that's exactly what they want.
[01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.757]  They want violence so that they can instill martial law.
[01:06:04.138 --> 01:06:04.879]  You're absolutely right.
[01:06:04.939 --> 01:06:07.000]  I want to get back into this report later.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:14.566]  But right now, you've got some breaking news from mainline UN documents about who's really calling the shots and running things.
[01:06:14.906 --> 01:06:16.388]  Let's go ahead and get into that right now.
[01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:23.073]  Well, I just want everybody to be aware because, as you know, I kind of operate on a macro, global, political...
[01:06:23.533 --> 01:06:25.434]  I want to know who's really running the show.
[01:06:25.934 --> 01:06:29.096]  And we hear now that Obama's in, and now we're in for change.
[01:06:29.856 --> 01:06:43.702]  But I think we need to look at the remarks of his National Security Advisor, General James L. Jones, who last month was at the 45th Munich Security Conference in Germany.
[01:06:44.462 --> 01:06:46.643]  And they had honored Henry Kissinger.
[01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:51.045]  And of course, we all remember Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Nixon.
[01:06:53.068 --> 01:06:58.222]  And the guy who's responsible for our foreign policy that's gotten us in the mess we're in right now.
[01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:07.909]  Also a man who is wanted in several countries for war crimes and can't even go into those countries because there are warrants out for his arrest.
[01:07:08.369 --> 01:07:16.891]  So I think that your listeners need to understand when I tell you that the remarks by James L. Jones to the Munich Security Conference open with this.
[01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:20.852]  Thank you for that wonderful tribute to Henry Kissinger yesterday.
[01:07:20.952 --> 01:07:21.912]  Congratulations.
[01:07:22.692 --> 01:07:28.133]  As the most recent National Security Advisor of the United States, now listen carefully,
[01:07:28.693 --> 01:07:36.560]  I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger, filtered down through General Brent Snowcroft and Sandy Berger, who is also here.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.945]  We have a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today.
[01:07:42.705 --> 01:07:44.487]  And I ask you, so where's the change?
[01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:49.291]  Obama's National Security Advisor takes his daily orders from Henry Kissinger?
[01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:50.412]  Where's the change?
[01:07:50.452 --> 01:07:55.716]  Well, I mean, the Pope is advised by Kissinger, because he works for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers publicly.
[01:07:55.916 --> 01:07:56.297]  Exactly.
[01:07:56.417 --> 01:08:05.725]  And he gets up on MSNBC, it's in the Obama Deception, and says, Obama's going to sell the world on a new world order, a global banking elite, where we pay our carbon taxes to them.
[01:08:06.405 --> 01:08:07.526]  And there's no change.
[01:08:07.566 --> 01:08:09.047]  It doesn't matter who comes into office.
[01:08:09.408 --> 01:08:14.012]  You've got these imperial legates, like Henry Kissinger, who are really around the shots, and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:08:14.372 --> 01:08:17.895]  Go over again the providence of that, where you got that specifically, where folks can find it.
[01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:24.577]  I pointed this out, and specifically the line he says, I take my daily orders from Henry Kissinger.
[01:08:24.918 --> 01:08:28.539]  This is Barack Obama's National Security Advisor, okay?
[01:08:28.959 --> 01:08:31.280]  And people said, oh well, where'd that come from?
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.501]  That can't be true.
[01:08:35.101 --> 01:08:39.003]  Folks, it's right off the Council on Foreign Relations website.
[01:08:39.043 --> 01:08:40.764]  This is from the CFR.
[01:08:40.804 --> 01:08:43.625]  Yeah, up at the top, if you want to show that
[01:08:45.503 --> 01:08:46.644]  Give me a close shot on this camera.
[01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:47.624]  We'll go on this camera right here.
[01:08:47.744 --> 01:08:51.026]  Just go to the Council on Foreign Relations website.
[01:08:51.066 --> 01:08:53.367]  The gloves are coming off, Alex.
[01:08:53.507 --> 01:08:54.747]  They don't care who knows now.
[01:08:55.047 --> 01:08:56.528]  And why do you think that is?
[01:08:56.828 --> 01:09:09.294]  Well, because ever since their inception back in 1921-22, they've moved very, very surreptitiously, very deceitfully, keeping everything under quiet, under wraps.
[01:09:09.794 --> 01:09:13.516]  But beginning with the assassination of President Kennedy,
[01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:29.268]  And with the control they had over Lyndon Johnson and then over Richard Nixon, who was putting politics with Nazi money, they have slowly grown in their power and in their control to the point where now they don't really care what you know.
[01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:33.652]  Their attitude now is almost, we're in charge, what are you going to do about it?
[01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:34.892]  That's right.
[01:09:34.912 --> 01:09:37.833]  This is from the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR.org.
[01:09:37.853 --> 01:09:43.514]  You can just Google, Remarks by National Security Advisor Jones at 45th Munich Conference.
[01:09:43.534 --> 01:09:45.675]  In fact, we'll get that up on screen right now.
[01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:50.856]  Remarks by National Security Advisor Jones at 45th Munich Conference on Security Policy.
[01:09:50.876 --> 01:09:54.137]  When you read even the public CFR stuff and Trilateral Commission stuff,
[01:09:54.597 --> 01:10:08.846]  They said in the 70s they were going to bankrupt the world economy, bring in a global currency, and we're here warning people and so we get put in terrorism reports because we go to the CFR and say, oh look what's going on, when all we do is cover the facts here of the bankers raping everybody.
[01:10:09.627 --> 01:10:12.129]  Basically, Alex, you and I are simply reporters.
[01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:15.551]  The real terrorists are the people who are actually implementing these policies.
[01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:16.532]  Absolutely.
[01:10:16.652 --> 01:10:18.154]  I mean, this is so important.
[01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:19.455]  Read that again to people.
[01:10:19.535 --> 01:10:21.738]  I mean, that is powerful, Jim, that you brought in.
[01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:31.509]  The day before, they had honored Henry Kissinger at the 45th Munich Conference, and so the next day at the Hotel Bayer Scherhoff on February the 8th, 2009,
[01:10:33.191 --> 01:10:42.173]  Barack Obama's newly named National Security Advisor, General James L. Jones, gets up and he says, Thank you for that wonderful tribute to Henry Kissinger yesterday.
[01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:43.513]  Congratulations.
[01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:54.435]  As the most recent National Security Advisor of the United States, I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger, filtered down through General Brent Snowcroft and Sandy Berger, who's also here.
[01:10:54.735 --> 01:10:58.736]  We have a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today.
[01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:03.057]  In other words, the same people are still running the show through the National Security
[01:11:03.117 --> 01:11:06.078]  Yeah, these are people who aren't even officially in the National Security Council.
[01:11:06.098 --> 01:11:07.098]  Who voted for Henry Kissinger?
[01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:10.839]  Listen, they're not in the National Security Council officially, but remember the Washington Post three weeks ago.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:21.963]  They said that under North Common Homeland Security, Congress has no authority, repeating PDD 51, and that the National Security Council rules all, not even the President.
[01:11:22.263 --> 01:11:32.126]  The President's a guy, whether it's George Bush or Ronald Reagan or Barack Obama, who goes and reads off a teleprompter, and that's all he does, and then he goes and plays basketball and smokes cigarettes, in his own words.
[01:11:32.546 --> 01:11:40.973]  So, and then we're having these stupid childish arguments with Obama supporters or Bush supporters when the elite admit they're running everything instead of the puppets.
[01:11:40.993 --> 01:11:43.555]  Look past the puppets to the actual elite.
[01:11:43.575 --> 01:11:48.659]  The Obama Deception on sale now, by the way, on DVD at Infowars.com.

[01:11:54.804 --> 01:11:55.545]  Use this tool.
[01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:56.686]  People are ready to wake up.
[01:11:56.986 --> 01:12:00.629]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:06.335]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:12:06.435 --> 01:12:10.478]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:12:10.758 --> 01:12:13.061]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:19.126]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:12:19.206 --> 01:12:20.027]  We're good to go!
[01:12:51.566 --> 01:13:00.327]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:38.783]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:08.679]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:15.385]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:17.506]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:20.069]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:14:20.129 --> 01:14:31.018]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:14:33.306 --> 01:14:34.567]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:34.967 --> 01:14:36.368]  It's about a one world government.
[01:14:36.828 --> 01:14:43.171]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:14:51.995 --> 01:14:53.156]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:54.757]  The people strike back.
[01:14:56.678 --> 01:15:00.059]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:15:00.199 --> 01:15:05.421]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:10.383]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:15:10.764 --> 01:15:21.868]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:27.833]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:15:28.053 --> 01:15:34.138]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:15:34.318 --> 01:15:34.979]  What about you?
[01:15:35.359 --> 01:15:41.404]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:16:00.795 --> 01:16:08.741]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, with Jim Mars here in studio with us, author of The Rise of the Fourth Reich, which we have at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:08.801 --> 01:16:10.882]  This is our best-selling book right now.
[01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:12.003]  It's powerful info.
[01:16:12.484 --> 01:16:14.205]  No, it's not saying the Nazis run things.
[01:16:14.225 --> 01:16:18.368]  The Nazis got it all from the English in the U.S., the system of corporate fascism.
[01:16:19.068 --> 01:16:22.091]  And one of the preeminent 9-11 books, The Terror Conspiracy,
[01:16:22.771 --> 01:16:27.474]  Deception, 9-11, and the loss of Liberty, Jim Mars, all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:27.634 --> 01:16:34.078]  You're going to be speaking tomorrow night at Brave New Books, down at the end of the drag, right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:16:34.118 --> 01:16:35.198]  BraveNewBooks.com.
[01:16:35.839 --> 01:16:36.259]  That's it.
[01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:37.680]  Hope to see everybody there.
[01:16:38.539 --> 01:16:42.602]  Now, Jim, you've got some new news on Kissinger and the whole thing.
[01:16:42.702 --> 01:16:43.142]  That's right.
[01:16:43.222 --> 01:16:55.349]  We were mentioning Kissinger, and you just mentioned my book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, which, and I'm glad you clarified this, I'm not trying to say that goose-stepping Germans have taken over the United States.
[01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:59.612]  It's this moneyed elite, the very people who created communism in Russia,
[01:17:00.112 --> 01:17:09.481]  And then grew fearful because it was going to spread worldwide, so they created National Socialism or Nazism in Germany, and then after the war they brought them all over here.
[01:17:10.021 --> 01:17:10.382]  Okay?
[01:17:10.482 --> 01:17:13.424]  And they've been building up a power base ever since.
[01:17:13.505 --> 01:17:14.525]  We're the new empire.
[01:17:14.586 --> 01:17:15.506]  We're the fourth Reich.
[01:17:15.526 --> 01:17:16.267]  That's my argument.
[01:17:16.748 --> 01:17:24.234]  But as a capper of that, last year, Henry Kissinger, who's wanted for war crimes in a number of countries,
[01:17:24.995 --> 01:17:33.074]  ...honored former President George Herbert Walker Bush and named him as the man most instrumental for the reunification of Germany.
[01:17:34.435 --> 01:17:36.517]  And presented him with this big award.
[01:17:36.537 --> 01:17:39.599]  This was in July of 2008.
[01:17:40.639 --> 01:17:42.701]  And guess where they held the honor ceremony?
[01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:44.862]  On the Wannsee.
[01:17:45.362 --> 01:17:55.089]  This lake in Germany, where in January 1942 was held the Wannsee Conference, which is where they decided the final solution.
[01:17:55.549 --> 01:17:59.910]  This is when they made the decisions to exterminate the Jews and the Gypsies and the homosexuals.
[01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:12.574]  And we know Kissinger signed the CIA memorandum, State Department memorandum 200, to force nations that take money to at least reduce their population by half, and they're all into eugenics.
[01:18:12.795 --> 01:18:14.055]  So again, we go back to that.
[01:18:14.355 --> 01:18:20.718]  This is the same Nazi program, the same Nationalist program that they were trying to carry to fruition.
[01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.419]  And you have that from Fox News of all places.
[01:18:22.439 --> 01:18:23.840]  That's right off of Fox News.
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.901]  This is not deep secret stuff.
[01:18:26.141 --> 01:18:28.443]  Hi guys, they've already got it up on screen in there.
[01:18:29.023 --> 01:18:35.987]  You know, for those who don't understand, the eugenicists, that was the main line scientific rage from the 1870s to the 1940s.
[01:18:36.227 --> 01:18:38.088]  Right.
[01:18:38.168 --> 01:18:41.270]  In fact, the first eugenic center was set up in this country.
[01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:41.990]  Cold Springs Harbor.
[01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:45.491]  Yeah, and from money from Mrs. Edward Harriman.
[01:18:45.852 --> 01:18:52.535]  And I think it should be pointed out that the Harrimans were the mentors and closest support of the Bushes.
[01:18:52.595 --> 01:18:57.597]  Now to explain this, mainline history books, and you're a big historian on this as well, so you can speak to it, I want you to.
[01:18:58.775 --> 01:19:02.277]  You know, the Crown King of England was a big Nazi, hung out with him.
[01:19:02.297 --> 01:19:06.059]  They told the Nazis, help fund them, we're going to let you take over Europe and fight the Russians.
[01:19:06.499 --> 01:19:07.820]  And then Hitler was a bad guy.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.220]  The point is, they set him up.
[01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:17.585]  And that's why the Reich Deputy Fuhrer flew in once the war started, parachuted into England, Rudolf Hess, and said, why are you doing this?
[01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:18.805]  They grabbed him, threw him in the tower.
[01:19:19.086 --> 01:19:24.248]  Hitler said, okay, they've betrayed us, we've still got to beat the Communists, and then turned east with Operation Barbarossa.
[01:19:24.568 --> 01:19:27.570]  And so this is the mastermind level of the Milner Group.
[01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.572]  Lord Milner and others, explain that.
[01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:31.613]  Yeah, well, that's how they operate.
[01:19:32.414 --> 01:19:37.378]  In fact, you know, it's this amazing, the current Pope... Hitler Youth.
[01:19:37.718 --> 01:19:38.619]  It was a Hitler Youth.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.863]  Yeah, Joseph Ratzinger in 1944, he was a member of the Hitler Youth.
[01:19:43.823 --> 01:19:48.085]  Uh, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of our largest populated state.
[01:19:48.405 --> 01:19:51.706]  His father was a Nazi guy-liner, a Nazi political leader.
[01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:53.547]  I mean, it kind of makes you wonder who won the war.
[01:19:54.227 --> 01:19:58.589]  And, uh, but as you said, there, there are ideas of extermination and, uh,
[01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:04.032]  Of killing people and of sterilization.
[01:20:29.569 --> 01:20:30.990]  I don't know.
[01:20:46.744 --> 01:20:49.247]  To be the center of power with industry and science.
[01:20:49.267 --> 01:20:52.310]  To lead the financial power of the world, exactly.
[01:20:52.370 --> 01:21:00.198]  That had been, that had resided first with the British Empire, and then they had shared it with the Rockefellers and the Morgans and the DuPonts, okay?
[01:21:00.238 --> 01:21:07.064]  And so now they had that Anglo-American financial elite that was running everything, and they didn't want to cut Germany in.
[01:21:07.765 --> 01:21:10.506]  Yeah, so some people email me and go, what, you're defending the Nazis?
[01:21:10.606 --> 01:21:12.886]  No, use more than two-dimensional thinking.
[01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:21.468]  No, we're saying the globalists, on record, set them up like a wind-up toy, and that it originated from the United States and England, everything we saw unfold.
[01:21:21.848 --> 01:21:25.229]  Why do you think Hitler let the British Army get away at Dunkirk?
[01:21:25.249 --> 01:21:26.169]  Dunkirk, no, on record.
[01:21:26.349 --> 01:21:29.109]  I mean, he just stopped and let them all go back to Iran.
[01:21:29.129 --> 01:21:32.510]  And then he had a deal with the Vichy French to basically stand down so they could take over.
[01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:40.714]  And the whole idea was that they were all going to turn and ally and make peace with each other and then turn against the Soviet Union.
[01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:41.835]  But that was a big setup.
[01:21:41.875 --> 01:21:44.116]  They made secret pacts that the British and the U.S.
[01:21:44.156 --> 01:21:44.836]  broke.
[01:21:44.856 --> 01:21:45.376]  Stay with us.
[01:21:45.396 --> 01:21:46.037]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:47.317 --> 01:21:48.218]  We're on the march.
[01:21:48.718 --> 01:21:50.299]  The empire's on the run.

[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.903]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:03.404 --> 01:23:10.394]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:10.968 --> 01:23:17.153]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:17.553 --> 01:23:19.395]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:19.535 --> 01:23:21.957]  He's fudged since day one in this election.

[01:24:01.899 --> 01:24:10.286]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:15.211]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:24:15.431 --> 01:24:22.337]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:24:22.517 --> 01:24:25.059]  This water system will descale all piping, hot
[01:24:25.179 --> 01:24:25.719]  I think so.
[01:24:48.553 --> 01:24:50.759]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:24:50.779 --> 01:24:51.080]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:24.357]  By the way, I didn't know we'd launch this.
[01:25:24.477 --> 01:25:26.678]  It's up on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:25:26.739 --> 01:25:29.841]  A tour of the office that we promised to do for folks.
[01:25:30.801 --> 01:25:31.402]  The new offices.
[01:25:31.422 --> 01:25:33.163]  What do you think of the new offices, Jim?
[01:25:33.943 --> 01:25:35.084]  This is really great.
[01:25:35.204 --> 01:25:42.369]  It's only fitting that a cutting-edge news commentator like you have cutting-edge production facilities.
[01:25:42.529 --> 01:25:45.711]  Well, I don't know if it's cutting-edge, but it's certainly better than what we had before.
[01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:46.872]  You got more room, don't you?
[01:25:47.172 --> 01:25:48.073]  Yeah, we've got 7,800 square feet.
[01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:57.549]  And a little bit of room next door to us has come open, because I thought we'd have room for a TV studio, but I don't know what I'm going to do, but it's crazy.
[01:25:57.809 --> 01:26:00.130]  And the economy's going to hell in a handbasket, I don't know what to do.
[01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:11.775]  You know, because I can sit here, I can fund what we're doing, but then it means more sponsors, more time spent on that, which I'd rather just put the info out, but then you need the cutting edge and the staff and the people to do it right.
[01:26:11.935 --> 01:26:12.875]  And all that takes money.
[01:26:13.155 --> 01:26:13.856]  Well, it sure does.
[01:26:13.896 --> 01:26:16.437]  Well, see, this is something that really bothers me, Alex.
[01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:32.688]  You and me, and we could name a dozen other people, and people are trying to run websites, people are trying to publish books, and we're all struggling, trying to make a living like everybody else, and we're going up against people with very deep pockets.
[01:26:33.268 --> 01:26:40.052]  And the irony, and the thing that really torques me off is, those deep pockets are filled with our tax money.
[01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:42.614]  Yeah, they're using their money against us.
[01:26:42.774 --> 01:26:43.835]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:57.524]  And all we want to do is try to bring truth to people, and then people are confused because they say, well I hear Alex Jones said this, but then I didn't see that on CNN or Fox, so it must be just conspiracy theory or fringe information.
[01:26:57.984 --> 01:27:07.131]  And yet, like everything we've talked about since I've come on here, this is all off of mainstream news sources, I mean, and off the Council on Foreign Relations website.
[01:27:07.331 --> 01:27:08.732]  We're not making this stuff up.
[01:27:09.413 --> 01:27:11.690]  It just always has their spin on it.
[01:27:12.421 --> 01:27:12.661]  Right.
[01:27:12.901 --> 01:27:14.162]  They put their spin on it.
[01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:23.610]  Well, of course, and that's why, you know, when I mention the Council on Foreign Relations, I'll be the first to admit, I don't think everybody on the Council on Foreign Relations is some kind of sinister conspirator.
[01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:24.530]  No, it's compartmentalized.
[01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:40.203]  No, it's very compartmentalized and there's an inter-corps elite, okay, but they surround themselves, for example, you and I could... They get all the top CEOs and bankers and media people in there so they can watch them and know what trends are and have people everywhere they can call on favors and they...
[01:27:40.723 --> 01:27:44.605]  They, they, they propel the careers of, it's down to 5,000 people.
[01:27:44.805 --> 01:27:45.045]  Right.
[01:27:45.225 --> 01:27:52.489]  And then they can nudge them, you know, with their foundations and think tanks and studies, you know, they say, well, you know, this is what we need to do.
[01:27:52.529 --> 01:27:53.690]  Now, my point is this.
[01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.231]  They would argue
[01:27:55.891 --> 01:28:13.095]  That, you know, letting the Council on Foreign Relations and their 5,000 elite people run everything is only sensible because they know how to handle money, they know how everything works, they've got big educations and degrees, so therefore this is the path to peace and prosperity.
[01:28:13.676 --> 01:28:14.516]  And I would argue
[01:28:15.575 --> 01:28:34.452]  If their plans and their actions are the way to peace and prosperity, go back and look at history since their inception in 1921, and you'll find we've had two world wars, a depression, stock market crash, unlimited other wars, political assassinations.
[01:28:34.712 --> 01:28:36.514]  Their track record's not very good.
[01:28:37.557 --> 01:28:39.138]  Well, I mean, let's expand on that.
[01:28:39.839 --> 01:28:41.941]  They fund wars, they kill millions of people.
[01:28:42.741 --> 01:28:46.284]  Brzezinski brags in two books he wrote that he engineered Pol Pot.
[01:28:46.605 --> 01:28:48.967]  I mean, he's proud of that, so they're very wicked at the top.
[01:28:49.027 --> 01:29:05.060]  He also has admitted that as Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter, he sent spies and provocateurs into Afghanistan to lure the Russians into moving into Afghanistan so they could have a big... A staging terror attack six months before
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.364]  Yeah, staging terror attacks to bring in the Russians.
[01:29:08.765 --> 01:29:11.789]  He's proud of it because he said that helped defeat the Soviets.
[01:29:11.889 --> 01:29:15.373]  Well, I mean, here's an example of how our detractors work.
[01:29:15.494 --> 01:29:17.576]  Not people that are government operatives or disinfo.
[01:29:17.596 --> 01:29:19.278]  They're out there too, but people that get mad at me.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.301]  I've done my own little studies.
[01:29:21.341 --> 01:29:23.083]  Like, I'll be on one of my YouTube videos.
[01:29:24.335 --> 01:29:31.119]  And I'll see a comment going, Alex Jones is a dirtbag, piece of filth, uh, fed, and I hope he dies, basically.
[01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:40.364]  And I'll link through to the guy's website, and he's a Georgian living in America, and he's like, all hail Georgia, Georgia will smash Russia, Russia's the devil.
[01:29:40.444 --> 01:29:43.265]  And we're not talking about the state that houses Atlanta.
[01:29:43.785 --> 01:29:46.567]  We're talking about Georgia and southern Russia, right?
[01:29:46.607 --> 01:29:47.407]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:47.427 --> 01:29:48.568]  They're on the Black Sea.
[01:29:50.413 --> 01:29:59.519]  And I know right away, that person doesn't like me because I reported that it was a U.S.-Israeli-NATO-backed sneak attack on South Ossetia to kick off a new Cold War.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.481]  And so, but think about his flawed logic.
[01:30:02.641 --> 01:30:10.607]  I'm a Fed because I am against the U.S., Israel, and NATO starting a new Cold War.
[01:30:10.627 --> 01:30:13.128]  If I was a Fed, I'd be going with their policies.
[01:30:13.528 --> 01:30:19.893]  But he makes the instant decision, he knows there's a New World Order, so he has to then make me the bad New World Order
[01:30:20.733 --> 01:30:23.255]  Look, I'm no fan of Putin, I'm no fan of a lot of things going on in Russia.
[01:30:23.275 --> 01:30:30.378]  The whole point is, I know the globalists have this master game, their policy is to start a war with Russia, to start new conflicts, so I'm against that.
[01:30:30.739 --> 01:30:43.766]  Just like, I'm not weighing in on the Serb-Muslim crow outside, I just know that the UN went in, used Arabs to attack the Serbs, got the Serbs to move in, and then went in and blew Serbia away, so again,
[01:30:45.495 --> 01:30:56.940]  I'm finding that everybody that attacks me has a little reason, because they're tribal, and they think I'm criticizing their little group, when no, everybody would be better off if the New World Order wasn't stirring up regional conflicts and wars.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:05.363]  But that's my point, is that I can link through on somebody's name, and look at their page, and then it's always right there why they don't like me.
[01:31:05.563 --> 01:31:05.783]  Right.
[01:31:05.843 --> 01:31:08.104]  But the thing is, they need to look up.
[01:31:08.304 --> 01:31:09.745]  They need to get the bigger picture.
[01:31:10.325 --> 01:31:11.665]  Well, I'm not against Georgia.
[01:31:11.685 --> 01:31:15.386]  I'm not like, you know, I want to destroy Georgia.
[01:31:15.406 --> 01:31:17.607]  I mean, most Georgians aren't glad that they got in that war.
[01:31:17.627 --> 01:31:25.169]  And in the Clinton years, in the Kosovo, by the way, the Kosovo Liberation Army was the group that we were supporting.
[01:31:25.249 --> 01:31:26.629]  And how were we supporting it?
[01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:29.050]  Because we were allowing al-Qaeda
[01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:35.092]  To supply arms and training to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
[01:31:35.312 --> 01:31:39.194]  And in return, we let them do their drug smuggling through the Balkans.
[01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.775]  Now, this is all documented, but people don't get told this.
[01:31:42.815 --> 01:31:43.715]  They don't know this.
[01:31:44.195 --> 01:31:55.940]  All they do is listen to the establishment media, and then they think, oh, well, it's this way, and they get totally dragged down into conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, yada, yada, yada.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.581]  You gotta look up, folks.
[01:31:57.741 --> 01:31:59.302]  You gotta look up and see the big picture.
[01:31:59.342 --> 01:32:01.403]  You gotta see who's really running the show.
[01:32:01.423 --> 01:32:02.624]  You gotta look behind the mask.
[01:32:02.944 --> 01:32:08.368]  That's why I really, uh, I've got to compliment you on your new, uh, Obama deception.
[01:32:08.548 --> 01:32:09.969]  Because it is a deception.
[01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.949]  Okay?
[01:32:10.989 --> 01:32:14.652]  And I've, I know people who say, well, I met Obama, he's a very nice guy.
[01:32:14.992 --> 01:32:18.833]  Well, I know people who said they met George W. Bush, and he's a really nice guy.
[01:32:19.193 --> 01:32:24.135]  And I don't know personally either one of those fellas, so I'll say maybe they're telling me the truth.
[01:32:24.395 --> 01:32:28.876]  But what you and I know, and what we're trying to tell people is, they're just little puppets.
[01:32:28.896 --> 01:32:29.816]  They're front people.
[01:32:29.876 --> 01:32:36.298]  They're just talking heads that we see on the television, and their whole persona is carefully crafted.
[01:32:37.028 --> 01:32:37.288]  Right?
[01:32:37.788 --> 01:32:39.689]  They are creations of the media.
[01:32:40.210 --> 01:32:58.980]  Ronald Reagan, we were all told what a fine family man, he went to church every Sunday, and you know, da-da-da, and then after he's out of office, we find out that he never went to church, he had family problems, dysfunctional family, and his wife was a consulting astrologer, you know, so it's, these are just little
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:08.832]  Uh, little scenarios crafted by the corporate media to, and everybody thinks that's the way it is, and when you try to tell them it's not, then they get mad at you.
[01:33:09.975 --> 01:33:10.716]  Absolutely.
[01:33:12.058 --> 01:33:14.420]  You've got some other little interesting things to go over there.
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.802]  What's that little chart you've got?
[01:33:15.822 --> 01:33:26.054]  Well, this is a chart of how the organic food industry has been brought in under and bought up by the major agriculture food corporations.
[01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:28.316]  Heinz, Coca-Cola, Kellogg, Cargill.
[01:33:28.356 --> 01:33:28.977]  Take your time.
[01:33:28.997 --> 01:33:29.538]  Go over that.
[01:33:29.818 --> 01:33:30.998]  Okay, well, no, no, no.
[01:33:31.058 --> 01:33:45.304]  The reason I think everybody, especially if you're into health food or if you're into the food industry or if you're a farmer or know anything about it, you already know that agribusiness is where it's at and that it's all tied so closely in with corporate, the corporate food thing.
[01:33:45.764 --> 01:33:51.406]  What I want to tell you about is HR 875, which is legislation now pending in Congress,
[01:33:51.906 --> 01:33:57.388]  It's known as the Food Safety Modernization Act, and people need to take a close look at this.
[01:33:57.428 --> 01:34:11.555]  And I'll be frank, I have not looked at it even this close, but I know that just from what I've seen and by glancing over some of the paragraphs and some of the clauses in this proposed legislation, essentially it's going to mean you can't have a garden.
[01:34:12.695 --> 01:34:18.078]  Because they are going to throw so much stuff at you, you've got to show where it's coming from and what it contains and everything else.
[01:34:18.378 --> 01:34:20.919]  And it's going to criminalize growing a garden.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.660]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:34:23.801 --> 01:34:27.563]  During World War II, of course, we were all encouraged to grow gardens.
[01:34:27.643 --> 01:34:29.944]  We were going to have victory gardens, right?
[01:34:30.404 --> 01:34:31.345]  And well, here we are.
[01:34:31.385 --> 01:34:35.227]  We're in a war on drugs and a war on poverty and a war on terrorism.
[01:34:35.247 --> 01:34:37.628]  You know, you'd think they'd say, let's grow gardens.
[01:34:38.749 --> 01:34:56.091]  But no, no, this legislation passed, the Food Safety Modernization Act, it's going to leave food production and preparation up to the giant corporations and they can use this to just shut down small farms and even your own little private garden.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:23.541]  and uh... you can see this happening all over the and then of course we have the whole bill which i'm sure you've already talked about which is the gun control thing and uh... it's you you mentioned that earlier you it's going to criminalize everybody owns guns was going to do and another thing i didn't hear you mention this is that it's going to call for voluntary physicals and psychological uh... uh... profiling not profiling the psychological testing
[01:35:23.561 --> 01:35:24.342]  No, it's involuntary.
[01:35:24.362 --> 01:35:25.322]  Every gun owner has to do it.
[01:35:25.643 --> 01:35:28.265]  You've got to be able to own your gun, okay?
[01:35:28.305 --> 01:35:29.446]  Now, can you picture this?
[01:35:30.026 --> 01:35:33.629]  Okay, Mr. Jones, do you believe 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:35:33.929 --> 01:35:40.174]  Well, yes, there's evidence... Well, we think you need further... They've already said that's a mental illness.
[01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.356]  Yeah, it's an evil government syndrome.
[01:35:43.316 --> 01:35:44.257]  Somebody came up with that.
[01:35:44.277 --> 01:35:46.519]  Let me go over a key point here, and I want you to cover this.
[01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:49.561]  We know the Feds come in with the $787 million stimulus package.
[01:35:52.301 --> 01:35:54.061]  That I call the federalization package.
[01:35:54.942 --> 01:36:02.464]  And what they did in that, is they come into the counties and cities, this is on record, and they say, we want you to make people be licensed to have a garden.
[01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:05.604]  Because they may grow marijuana.
[01:36:06.124 --> 01:36:09.205]  And you can't have, I mean imagine, free people, you know, we're prisoners.
[01:36:09.885 --> 01:36:12.646]  Imagine, we're guilty until proven innocent, we can't have a garden.
[01:36:12.686 --> 01:36:15.807]  So here is the Tulsa News, now this is Tulsa World,
[01:36:16.874 --> 01:36:24.836]  Tulsa City Council questions community gardens, and he goes on to say, community gardens, citizen gardens, you know, how do we know what these people are going to be growing?
[01:36:24.936 --> 01:36:25.456]  Vegetables?
[01:36:25.576 --> 01:36:26.977]  Maybe there'll be something else, he said.
[01:36:27.537 --> 01:36:30.238]  Is there going to be someone who inspects what is growing?
[01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:34.119]  And so he wants police to come in and inspect your gardens.
[01:36:34.179 --> 01:36:37.620]  Now, they're bulldozing them all over the country, they're getting rid of them.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.761]  That's being federally pushed.
[01:36:40.021 --> 01:36:43.363]  No, I'll tell you who's pushing that are the giant food corporations.
[01:36:43.383 --> 01:36:44.244]  Well, no, I mean, exactly.
[01:36:44.364 --> 01:36:47.646]  Animal ID, Premises ID, it's all about shutting them down.
[01:36:47.666 --> 01:36:48.266]  They admit that.
[01:36:48.326 --> 01:36:49.627]  Big Agar wrote it, but listen to this.
[01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:55.651]  This is a town in New York that says, Mayor considers options, martial law over political woes.
[01:36:56.251 --> 01:36:58.773]  Albany County, same place.
[01:36:59.233 --> 01:37:00.374]  Martial law, they said troops.
[01:37:02.446 --> 01:37:08.928]  Notice we heard Blagojevich, before he got kicked out, saying, I'm going to have National Guard statewide doing gun sweeps in the neighborhoods because of crime.
[01:37:08.968 --> 01:37:14.750]  We're now hearing all these governors, all these county commissioners, mayors, saying, we want troops, we want troops.
[01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:16.171]  Oh, there's a shooting in Alabama.
[01:37:16.251 --> 01:37:17.151]  Regular Army troops.
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:22.444]  Then, in Albany County, Local Law No.
[01:37:22.464 --> 01:37:28.210]  A-2009, anyone who goes and purchases ammo will be registered when they purchase it.
[01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:33.115]  A local law for the County of Albany, New York, regulating the purchase of ammunition in the County of Albany.
[01:37:33.135 --> 01:37:35.977]  And it's going to be up on PrisonPlanet.com here very soon.
[01:37:36.057 --> 01:37:37.098]  Paul Watts is doing an article.
[01:37:38.157 --> 01:37:40.880]  And it's just being enacted by the county.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:48.287]  And again, we happen to know that these locals are in a beta test with Obama through the stimulus money to do this.
[01:37:48.868 --> 01:37:51.771]  And so they're saying, you want the money, you've got to do this to start the precedent.
[01:37:51.951 --> 01:37:55.795]  This is happening nationwide in all these towns and cities, registering guns and ammo.
[01:37:56.095 --> 01:37:58.016]  Well, let's look at the flip side of this.
[01:37:58.076 --> 01:37:59.877]  People are going to say, well, what can I do about this?
[01:37:59.897 --> 01:38:01.097]  Well, here's what you can do about it.
[01:38:01.137 --> 01:38:03.258]  We need to take control back at the local level.
[01:38:03.639 --> 01:38:23.008]  I believe it's in Montana, a county in Montana, where the local sheriff, who is the highest law enforcement official under the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, has publicly sent notice to federal officials that if they violate the Constitution of the United States, that his deputies would escort them to the county line because they were no longer welcome in that county.
[01:38:23.368 --> 01:38:25.990]  This is the type of activity we've got to start moving to.
[01:38:26.230 --> 01:38:29.033]  You've got to gain control over your local representatives.
[01:38:29.473 --> 01:38:41.783]  But what's happened is, is over the years, with all this money, and now with everything under Homeland Security, and with billions of dollars of our tax money flowing down into the hands of local officials, they're buying them up, okay?
[01:38:42.003 --> 01:38:45.606]  And they're saying, okay, now here's what you need to do, and do this or we're going to cut you off at the foot.
[01:38:45.846 --> 01:38:47.146]  That's what I wanted you to comment on.
[01:38:47.206 --> 01:38:56.928]  So when you hear about them going after your guns, going after your gardens, suddenly all over the country they're raiding Amish for milk, for cheese, people for eggs, watermelons.
[01:38:57.208 --> 01:39:00.489]  Cops are pulling up and saying, you can't sell eggs on the side of the road.
[01:39:00.529 --> 01:39:01.689]  They've been ordered to do this.
[01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:04.750]  They are shutting, as they implode the economy.
[01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:09.991]  We were 90% rural in the Great Depression, 7 million starved to death according to big university studies that came out last year.
[01:39:10.931 --> 01:39:18.960]  So instead of now 10% are rural, only half of those are self-sufficient, we've gone from 90% self-sufficient to 5% self-sufficient with 10% on the land.
[01:39:19.241 --> 01:39:20.142]  And they're shutting them down.
[01:39:20.362 --> 01:39:21.643]  And so they're shutting them down.
[01:39:22.044 --> 01:39:24.186]  As the UN has said in official documents, 97...
[01:39:26.152 --> 01:39:28.074]  Beijing-China Population Summit.
[01:39:28.674 --> 01:39:30.176]  They will use food as a weapon.
[01:39:30.576 --> 01:39:31.797]  And so they're consolidating it.
[01:39:32.178 --> 01:39:33.439]  The poison GMO food.
[01:39:33.799 --> 01:39:34.760]  The people get mad.
[01:39:35.401 --> 01:39:37.162]  Most of the people start buying organic food.
[01:39:37.182 --> 01:39:38.003]  That becomes popular.
[01:39:38.023 --> 01:39:42.968]  They change the standard where it doesn't have to really be organic to have USDA certification.
[01:39:43.248 --> 01:39:45.030]  Private groups come out with their own certifications.
[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:45.751]  People go to that.
[01:39:45.991 --> 01:39:46.812]  Then they say, you know what?
[01:39:46.832 --> 01:39:48.073]  We're just shutting it all down.
[01:39:48.413 --> 01:39:56.497]  We're just, you know, in the name of some peanut butter problem, you know, that's big industry doing that or something, or people in Mexico crapping on the lettuce or the spinach.
[01:39:56.898 --> 01:40:03.041]  Again, they use that highly publicized a few deaths or whatever to bring in total control on the groups that are putting out the best cleanest food.
[01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:04.562]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:05.042 --> 01:40:06.123]  And now they're shutting down.
[01:40:06.683 --> 01:40:10.726]  The last, our last hope, of course, is firearms.
[01:40:11.946 --> 01:40:25.755]  You go back and you read all the writings in the Federalist Papers, you read the writings of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, they all made it very clear that the purpose of possessing firearms has nothing to do with hunting or sportsmanship or anything else.
[01:40:25.855 --> 01:40:29.738]  It has the right to protect yourself from a tyrannical government.
[01:40:30.018 --> 01:40:30.358]  Stay there.
[01:40:30.378 --> 01:40:34.599]  We're going to come back from break here in a moment in the final segment and cover a few other key issues.
[01:40:34.619 --> 01:40:35.899]  Jim, I've got to get you in here more often.
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:37.460]  This has been a fabulous interview.
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:42.941]  Before we do that, though, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of sponsors, I don't endorse a sponsor unless I believe in it.
[01:40:42.961 --> 01:40:44.681]  And remember, they also make this show possible.
[01:40:44.701 --> 01:40:46.182]  I want to tell you about HomeGain.
[01:40:46.602 --> 01:40:51.203]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.
[01:40:51.643 --> 01:40:59.065]  This is the place where you can get started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, and getting any real estate quotations answers.
[01:40:59.725 --> 01:41:01.206]  So again, it can tell you everything.
[01:41:01.586 --> 01:41:04.969]  Go to HomeGain.com and see what I'm talking about.
[01:41:05.049 --> 01:41:10.393]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you'll get an instant free estimate on your home value online.
[01:41:10.753 --> 01:41:13.295]  It's a great way to be able to monitor the value of your home.
[01:41:14.076 --> 01:41:15.837]  And again, it is absolutely free.
[01:41:15.937 --> 01:41:17.118]  HomeGain.com.
[01:41:17.478 --> 01:41:18.979]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[01:41:19.019 --> 01:41:22.922]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to HomeGain.com.
[01:41:24.563 --> 01:41:33.406]  And use their Home Sale Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:41:33.626 --> 01:41:37.327]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[01:41:37.367 --> 01:41:44.989]  Looking for the Max, the orange Home Gain Gorilla on the site to help you with any real estate needs you might have.
[01:41:45.309 --> 01:41:46.470]  Again, that's HomeGain.com.
[01:41:48.607 --> 01:41:52.870]  One of the other sponsors that makes this show possible is pmemory.net.
[01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:58.153]  You spend all the time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information can you actually recall?
[01:41:58.173 --> 01:41:58.793]  Hmm?
[01:41:59.594 --> 01:42:03.736]  Test yourself right now and try to recall the show that aired one week ago.
[01:42:03.756 --> 01:42:06.778]  How about two weeks ago?
[01:42:06.798 --> 01:42:10.321]  And if you cannot recall it, then that's my point.
[01:42:11.443 --> 01:42:12.704]  School of Phenomenal Memory.
[01:42:12.824 --> 01:42:13.745]  PMemory.net.
[01:42:13.785 --> 01:42:17.068]  Proven results from Lesson 1.
[01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.609]  Guaranteed.
[01:42:17.649 --> 01:42:18.770]  No gimmicks or magic pills.
[01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:21.453]  Just pure science and real training that makes sense.
[01:42:21.533 --> 01:42:26.638]  Memorize what you really need, such as names, daily information, new languages, and even entire books.
[01:42:26.738 --> 01:42:30.021]  Dramatically improve natural memory attention and thinking speed.
[01:42:30.081 --> 01:42:32.944]  Go to PMemory.net now and read hundreds of testimonials.

[01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:41.229]  School of Phenomenal Memory.

[01:42:48.033 --> 01:42:52.315]  Final segment of this really great show today with all these informative guests.
[01:42:52.595 --> 01:42:54.216]  Straight ahead after this quick break.
[01:42:54.496 --> 01:42:55.237]  Please stay with us.
[01:42:57.045 --> 01:43:02.748]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[01:43:02.888 --> 01:43:12.773]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataracts.
[01:43:12.873 --> 01:43:17.235]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[01:43:17.355 --> 01:43:24.317]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, can ease computer vision syndrome, and more.
[01:43:24.457 --> 01:43:30.179]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[01:43:30.199 --> 01:43:30.499]  I think so.
[01:43:57.583 --> 01:44:02.839]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:03.627 --> 01:44:08.971]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:09.511 --> 01:44:15.695]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:15.995 --> 01:44:17.816]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:17.976 --> 01:44:20.358]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:20.438 --> 01:44:31.325]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:33.607 --> 01:44:34.887]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:35.287 --> 01:44:36.628]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:37.148 --> 01:44:43.450]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:44.050 --> 01:44:51.812]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:52.312 --> 01:44:53.452]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:53.873 --> 01:44:55.053]  The people strike back.
[01:44:56.838 --> 01:44:57.679]  Attention gardeners!
[01:44:57.739 --> 01:45:00.102]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:45:00.342 --> 01:45:04.666]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:45:04.867 --> 01:45:12.755]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:45:13.055 --> 01:45:15.899]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:45:16.179 --> 01:45:23.729]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:45:23.829 --> 01:45:29.397]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:45:29.637 --> 01:45:35.179]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:45:35.459 --> 01:45:38.780]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:42.361]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:45:42.601 --> 01:45:47.643]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:45:47.663 --> 01:45:50.544]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:45:50.584 --> 01:45:50.764]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:46:05.422 --> 01:46:11.447]  Final segment with Jim Mars here in studio and the transmission is over until this Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:46:11.487 --> 01:46:28.641]  Central Standard Time and there's indicated transmission we do five days a week four hours a day isn't enough what's what's five times four that's 20 hours and then I do two more I do quite a few hours a week I guess that's 22 hours a week of live radio
[01:46:29.662 --> 01:46:30.482]  I don't see how you'd do it.
[01:46:30.762 --> 01:46:31.303]  Oh, I love it.
[01:46:31.323 --> 01:46:33.363]  And we've got a great crew in here that makes it all possible.
[01:46:34.164 --> 01:46:35.004]  You've got a new book out.
[01:46:35.044 --> 01:46:38.805]  We're not carrying it yet, but we do have Your Rise of the Fourth Reich.
[01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:39.786]  I think it's your best book.
[01:46:39.986 --> 01:46:42.747]  And the other one that we have at Infowars.com.
[01:46:42.767 --> 01:46:46.488]  But Jim Mars, Above Top Secret and Undercover Mysteries of the Digital Age.
[01:46:46.908 --> 01:46:51.850]  They sent us a copy of this, your publisher, and it was a great read because I could just read a chapter every night before I went to bed.
[01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:52.811]  It covers a lot of subjects.
[01:46:53.971 --> 01:47:01.186]  In the time we have left, when you came in with rave reviews about it, why did you like the Obama deception?
[01:47:02.012 --> 01:47:17.745]  Oh, well, I would recommend everyone get a copy of the Obama Deception because you're either already kind of anti-Obama, in which case you need to do your homework and get your ammunition for your arguments.
[01:47:18.426 --> 01:47:24.651]  Or you're pro-Obama and you really definitely need to see the Obama Deception because you've been deluded.
[01:47:25.451 --> 01:47:26.391]  And you've been fooled.
[01:47:26.451 --> 01:47:27.792]  And folks, let me tell you something.
[01:47:27.832 --> 01:47:30.432]  This is the same thing that's gone on over the past eight years.
[01:47:30.852 --> 01:47:41.735]  You had conservative Republicans who voted and were staunchly behind everything George W. Bush did because they thought he was a good constitutional conservative.
[01:47:41.775 --> 01:47:47.456]  They didn't realize that the term neocon actually meant national socialist.
[01:47:47.936 --> 01:47:48.276]  Okay?
[01:47:49.076 --> 01:47:50.917]  Now the same thing's happening in reverse.
[01:47:51.957 --> 01:47:58.983]  Because now we've got all these people who think that Obama is going to bring us some sort of change and we're going to get away from this National Socialism.
[01:47:59.003 --> 01:48:01.706]  He's just continuing the exact agenda with different window dressers.
[01:48:01.786 --> 01:48:02.446]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:02.466 --> 01:48:06.009]  And so now we've swapped National Socialism for Marxist Socialism.
[01:48:06.089 --> 01:48:12.115]  In fact, I'm sure you saw Newsweek that carried a big cover here a week or so ago that said, now we're all Socialists.
[01:48:12.475 --> 01:48:15.756]  Well, when did we get to vote for being socialists is what I want to know.
[01:48:16.137 --> 01:48:18.898]  So people need to understand, they need to see the Obama deception.
[01:48:18.918 --> 01:48:21.619]  Plus, it's not even real socialism.
[01:48:21.719 --> 01:48:23.060]  It's all going to the bankers.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.500]  Right, right.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:25.080]  Fascism.
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:28.762]  Well, this is what happened in Communist Russia and the Soviet Union.
[01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:30.783]  They said everything was in the name of the people.
[01:48:31.143 --> 01:48:32.784]  And yet the people never benefited.
[01:48:32.804 --> 01:48:35.585]  It all went to the Politburo and the Central Committee.
[01:48:36.305 --> 01:48:38.026]  And it's the same thing over here.
[01:48:38.086 --> 01:48:41.286]  I mean, come on, people need to just wise up, you know.
[01:48:41.346 --> 01:48:43.187]  And you say, well, how do you do that?
[01:48:43.287 --> 01:48:45.208]  Well, number one, turn off your TV.
[01:48:45.908 --> 01:48:48.048]  And spread the word about people like you.
[01:48:48.108 --> 01:48:48.748]  And talk to people.
[01:48:48.828 --> 01:48:49.749]  Tell folks your website.
[01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:51.329]  JimMars.com.
[01:48:51.389 --> 01:48:54.010]  J-I-M-M-A-R-R-S dot com.
[01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:57.491]  I try to put up articles that you probably never see on the
[01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.051]  Corporate, mainstream, mass media.
[01:49:00.752 --> 01:49:08.814]  And of course, between that and going to Infowars, that ought to give them a pretty good idea of what's going on.
[01:49:09.154 --> 01:49:15.155]  I want to thank you for reminding me of that Texas State Police that was a public report, just as bad as the Missouri MIAC report.
[01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:19.757]  It's good to see people angry about this, though, and saying, hey, we're not going to put up with your demonization.
[01:49:20.057 --> 01:49:25.358]  People that are doing this, they're the tyrants, they're the traitors, they're the people selling out what our country's based on.
[01:49:25.538 --> 01:49:25.998]  That's right.
[01:49:26.078 --> 01:49:31.540]  I would like to grab every law enforcement officer in Texas and say, listen, buddy, I'm on your side.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.421]  I am not a terrorist, okay?
[01:49:33.461 --> 01:49:44.925]  But likewise, I don't want you operating as some kind of thug for the international bankers who want to come and tell me I can't grow a garden and I can't own a gun and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:49:45.145 --> 01:49:47.626]  You know, because, hey, folks, we're all in this together.
[01:49:47.646 --> 01:49:49.206]  Jeremy, it always comes to your door in a uniform.
[01:49:49.246 --> 01:49:52.467]  If the police and military go along with this, they're going to help destroy this nation.
[01:49:52.487 --> 01:49:54.368]  What time are you speaking tomorrow at Brave New Books in Austin?
[01:49:54.668 --> 01:49:58.469]  Seven o'clock tomorrow at Brave New Books, right across from the University.
[01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:00.470]  And your talks on your new book, Above Top Secret?
[01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:05.772]  No, this is the topic you don't want to talk about, so we won't mention it.
[01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:07.033]  The Little Green Men?
[01:50:08.033 --> 01:50:13.575]  Well, I've been down here several times and I've talked about the rise of the Fourth Reich, I've talked about the secret history, I've talked about all this.
[01:50:13.615 --> 01:50:15.776]  You cover the areas that can be proven though, it's very interesting.
[01:50:15.876 --> 01:50:23.099]  Exactly, but everybody said, because every now and then something would come up about UFOs, and everybody demanded I come back down here and explain to them.
[01:50:23.179 --> 01:50:24.139]  Alright, we're out of time.
[01:50:24.179 --> 01:50:25.020]  Jim Marsh, thank you.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:25.360]  Bye.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.401]  Be back, I'll stay there for a second.
[01:50:27.441 --> 01:50:30.022]  Folks, retransmission starts in 70 seconds, one place.
[01:50:30.682 --> 01:50:33.323]  InfoWars.com on the web of the streams and AM and FM dials.
[01:50:33.343 --> 01:50:34.744]  See you Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:50:34.964 --> 01:50:35.624]  God bless you all.
[01:50:35.644 --> 01:50:36.304]  Great job, crew.

[01:50:47.022 --> 01:50:48.583]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:48.703 --> 01:50:53.346]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:56.207]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:56.407 --> 01:50:59.269]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:50:59.469 --> 01:51:04.152]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:04.392 --> 01:51:05.312]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:05.532 --> 01:51:08.493]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:08.773 --> 01:51:15.675]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
