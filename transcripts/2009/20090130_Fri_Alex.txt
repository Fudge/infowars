[00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:03.076]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:06.437]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.599]  Big Brother.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.300]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.121]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:18.581]  You want answers?
[00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:20.282]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:24.603]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:29.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:38.577]  Okay, on this January the 30th, 2009, this is Bob Dacey sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:39.978]  Alex has the day off today.
[00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.621]  Asked me to come in and host the show again, and I'm flying by the seat of my pants.
[00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.544]  Interview with Max Keiser was quite interesting.
[00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:55.107]  You know, he's like way above my level in financial things, but I think I handled myself relatively well, I think.
[00:00:55.996 --> 00:01:04.442]  And speaking of financial advisors, we have Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster on the line.
[00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:05.143]  Bob, are you there?
[00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:07.785]  No, I'm not here.
[00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:08.765]  You're not here.
[00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:12.628]  Well, is this a ghost I'm talking to there?
[00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:14.109]  It certainly is.
[00:01:14.589 --> 00:01:15.970]  The apparition of the day.
[00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.513]  Were you following the previous part of the show?
[00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:20.704]  No.
[00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:21.645]  No, I did not.
[00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:22.005]  I didn't.
[00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:22.665]  It came on.
[00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:27.187]  Yeah, you know, financial, you've got like a newsletter, right?
[00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:31.508]  And you advise people on what to do in this crazy financial world in order to try to survive.
[00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:32.289]  Is that the idea?
[00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.130]  Tell us about what you do just to set the stage.
[00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.751]  Well, the newsletter does that.
[00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:42.613]  We recommend stocks both long and short in the market and commodities.
[00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:47.815]  And we try to project events that are going to happen in the future.
[00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:52.550]  Like two years ago, we said we were in a recession.
[00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.872]  About a year ago, some other experts discovered it.
[00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:59.334]  And then last month, our government discovered it.
[00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:03.877]  Is the government going to discover that we're in a depression a year after we're in it?
[00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:04.498]  Or what?
[00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:05.899]  How's that going to work out?
[00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.921]  No, I think probably about two years after.
[00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:15.525]  But I have come out and said that the depression started this week.
[00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:23.808]  And the depression is an acute, very serious recession.
[00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:36.679]  The government will probably term it, but this depression is going to be far more difficult and longer to get out of than the previous one.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.223]  Based on what yardstick did you determine that we are now in a depression?
[00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:44.808]  I'm kind of curious.
[00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:45.669]  What's the difference?
[00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.435]  The GDP in the last quarter and in this quarter will be both negative.
[00:02:56.336 --> 00:03:04.801]  And when you have two negative GDP months in a row, you're on your way, especially if you're in a recession already.
[00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:11.586]  And I suspect that the second quarter of this year
[00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:30.193]  We'll be negative and if they get their money out into the system on this stimulus package, it'll probably moderate for a couple of quarters, maybe three, and then it'll head down again.
[00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:39.575]  All the stimulus package is doing is prolonging the agony and it's not creating any permanent jobs.
[00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:42.677]  Very little money is going out to the people.
[00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:57.322]  The reason that politicians don't want people to have money like they had this past year in the $168 billion stimulus package is that they said they'll pay their bills down.
[00:03:58.582 --> 00:04:00.903]  And that, in part, is probably true.
[00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:02.304]  You mean they might get out of debt?
[00:04:02.324 --> 00:04:03.444]  Yeah.
[00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:05.085]  Oh, we can't be happy with that.
[00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:08.426]  Yeah, they might even save it, if you can believe that.
[00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:18.410]  So, the politicians have decided that very little will go into the hands of the public.
[00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.897]  It looks like the Obama stimulus package, though, is going to be more like... We had the thing for the Republicans where they gave all the money to Wall Street, right?
[00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:34.202]  And now, the new stimulus package, which they voted in, apparently is going to pass more money out to Joe Schmoe, right?
[00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:35.463]  Isn't that going to be better?
[00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:39.859]  Yeah, but that's not what that package is going to do.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:49.383]  There'll be some tax breaks and a few other things, but it's indirect.
[00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:50.244]  Right.
[00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:52.345]  All right, Bob, hang on right there.
[00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:56.106]  We're going to be back after the break with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[00:04:56.146 --> 00:05:00.528]  This is Bob Dacey on the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:13.176]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:20.681]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.322]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:26.445]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:30.288]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:05:30.548 --> 00:05:34.630]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:38.433]  Phase One is a One World Currency which we are currently being prepared to use.
[00:05:38.473 --> 00:05:39.914]  We're good to go.
[00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.288]  TerrorStorm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.857]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:16.129]  We're good to go.
[00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:43.169]  We're good to go.
[00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:11.855]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:17.199]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:22.183]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:33.671]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:39.613]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:45.895]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:46.756]  What about you?

[00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:13.583]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:13.923 --> 00:08:16.204]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:26.559]  Yeah, and not only is there a war on for your mind, there's a war on for your money.
[00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:32.204]  And we've got Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster on, and we've been discussing the bailout.
[00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:37.829]  Bob, why won't the economic stimulus package work?
[00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.692]  Why is that?
[00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:44.034]  You know, you need consumerism is what you need.
[00:08:44.054 --> 00:08:45.075]  72% of the
[00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:59.460]  Uh, of the economy has been over the last several years, uh, made up, the GDP has been made up of consumer buying things.
[00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:07.165]  And my guess is it's probably dropped back to, uh, something on the order of 70%, maybe 71.
[00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:10.068]  And I think this is going to continue.
[00:09:10.188 --> 00:09:14.371]  And we really need the stimulus is with the public.
[00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:15.912]  Uh, the,
[00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:26.748]  Package is talking about the only thing that directly affects people is tax credits.
[00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:32.730]  And they are going to create government jobs as well as government contract jobs.
[00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.290]  But they're all temporary.
[00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:43.333]  And one of the good things about what they're doing is in the educational field.
[00:09:45.407 --> 00:09:57.590]  The previous administration had virtually shut off any increases for education, and that would keep teachers teaching in their classrooms.
[00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:05.651]  But the stimulus among the people is where it has to be, and it's not going to be there.
[00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.752]  And, you know, the argument in Congress about
[00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:12.185]  People saving the money.
[00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:15.846]  Dollars that are saved go to the bank, and the bank uses them.
[00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:17.386]  That's good.
[00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:19.647]  It's very good, as a matter of fact.
[00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:24.587]  And maybe that'll get Americans to mend their ways.
[00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:31.709]  Up until about six months ago, there was a negative one-half of one percent in savings.
[00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:34.369]  In other words, people were saving more than they were making.
[00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:38.110]  And now it's plus 2.8 percent, which is a start.
[00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.250]  And where would we like to see it?
[00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:42.632]  10 or 15 percent if possible.
[00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:46.554]  There are some nations that save 35 and 40 percent of income.
[00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:54.719]  I'm not saying that America should do that, but paying money into savings is good.
[00:10:54.819 --> 00:11:06.525]  Paying off bills is good because the money goes back to whomever you borrowed it from and they can use it to strengthen their balance sheet and maybe do something constructive with it.
[00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:13.039]  And so, the stimulus package is not bad, it's just not good and lasting.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:25.108]  And Congress and the Presidency continue to try to fix the problem and they're not doing anything to fix it.
[00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:26.970]  Nobody wants any pain.
[00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.412]  The money is coming out of thin air, is it not?
[00:11:29.472 --> 00:11:31.874]  I mean, you know, where do they get all this money?
[00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:34.276]  They just print it out of nothing.
[00:11:34.296 --> 00:11:37.098]  Well, they'll try to sell bonds.
[00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:42.794]  And they will be successful up to a certain point.
[00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:50.880]  And then the Treasury is going to have to sell bonds to the Federal Reserve, who creates money out of thin air to do that.
[00:11:51.921 --> 00:12:02.810]  And then they give the money to the Treasury Department, which in turn spends it and immediately monetizes it, which means it's immediately inflationary.
[00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.332]  And I suspect that's been going on already.
[00:12:05.372 --> 00:12:06.933]  They just lie about everything.
[00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:14.951]  And you can't really find out what they're doing, so what you have to do is guess what they're doing, you know, on a qualitative basis.
[00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:28.246]  That's the point I was trying to make with Max Keiser, who's a previous guest, is I don't see how you can come up with any accurate data because they lie and they cheat and they manipulate everything, and how do you know what's really going on?
[00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:37.270]  You know, I do have a rudimentary understanding of what causes inflation, and basically, you know, tell me where I'm wrong.
[00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:42.914]  You know, you keep making more and more money without a commensurate rise in the level of goods and services to buy all that money.
[00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:50.420]  It drives down the value of the money, and therefore you have what looks to be increasing prices, which is nothing more than the devaluation of the dollar.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.041]  Is that correct, or am I all wet?
[00:12:53.202 --> 00:12:58.426]  You're absolutely correct, and inflation can only be created
[00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:06.061]  By the monetary unit in America known as the Federal Reserve.
[00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:15.104]  It cannot be created any other way by creating more money in credit than what there are revenues coming into the Treasury.
[00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:18.226]  And so that's the end of it.
[00:13:18.266 --> 00:13:19.426]  You're absolutely right.
[00:13:21.607 --> 00:13:26.009]  We are facing hyperinflation and it's going to begin around March or April.
[00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.711]  Could be a little later, but it's coming.
[00:13:30.591 --> 00:13:34.392]  Let's define that because, you know, there's hyper, what is hyperinflation?
[00:13:34.412 --> 00:13:37.313]  We're not talking about Zimbabwe yet, we're talking about what?
[00:13:37.373 --> 00:13:38.614]  What percent, you say?
[00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:39.914]  What range are you talking about?
[00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:49.417]  Well, I think, I've seen a number of explanations to that.
[00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:54.059]  And the old classical example was 50% or higher.
[00:13:57.444 --> 00:14:03.028]  I think that anything over 15% is hyperinflationary.
[00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:05.891]  And we were just recently up to 13.58%.
[00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.934]  We're now back dabbling around 10%.
[00:14:10.214 --> 00:14:13.997]  And that's because of the drop in commodity prices.
[00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:25.687]  And that has fed into the PPI, the Producer Price Index, which has enabled people who use commodities to make things.
[00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:26.877]  We're good to go.
[00:14:55.478 --> 00:15:05.044]  The truth is, from government, because in 1980 they decided with the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, that they were going to change it.
[00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:08.666]  And it was a political and societal change.
[00:15:10.968 --> 00:15:15.591]  And the change was to not let anybody know
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.261]  That we were having an inflationary problem.
[00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:19.641]  So this is what's going on since then.
[00:15:35.074 --> 00:15:37.155]  And the other would say, no, we're going to have an inflation.
[00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:42.958]  And I'm trying to figure out where this is going to go out in my own business, a retail hardware business.
[00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:46.320]  I'm the local true value hardware guy in Austin, Texas.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.341]  That's what I do for a living.
[00:15:48.241 --> 00:15:55.005]  I have seen for the last year or so these constant price increases coming from our suppliers.
[00:15:55.485 --> 00:16:01.366]  We'll get a printout and it'll show you whatever item you used to buy for X amount of money is now Y amount of money.
[00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:05.047]  And you can look down the column and see what's going up and what's going down.
[00:16:05.067 --> 00:16:11.828]  And what I've seen in the last year and a half is just up, up, up, up, up, mostly 10, 11, 12 percent.
[00:16:12.248 --> 00:16:15.849]  That's just in regular stuff that people buy in a hardware store.
[00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:23.870]  I have this little window that I see into in terms of the whole big picture because I sell a broad variety of what consumer goods are.
[00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:33.276]  And so I wonder what is driving this deflation argument that a lot of financial advisors are talking about?
[00:16:35.177 --> 00:16:41.700]  Well, I think it's an excellent question, and it's not easy to answer, but I'm going to try to make it as simple as possible.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.843]  You're good, because that's important, because financial people tend to talk over everybody's head.
[00:16:47.863 --> 00:16:51.165]  Yeah, well, that doesn't help anybody.
[00:16:52.943 --> 00:16:58.084]  In June of 2005, housing began to peak.
[00:16:59.384 --> 00:17:01.525]  And it's been downhill since then.
[00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:06.686]  And as that happened, construction abated.
[00:17:06.706 --> 00:17:15.307]  And we had a general constricting within the building industry and the real estate industry.
[00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:19.268]  And then the price of homes went down.
[00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.922]  And Home Depot started laying off employees.
[00:17:50.075 --> 00:17:53.116]  And you had a diminution of assets.
[00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:57.037]  A deflationary flare began.
[00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:06.481]  When that happened, the Federal Reserve started to increase money and credit in a big way.
[00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:14.303]  In fact, they went as high on the M3, which they don't publish anymore and haven't for a couple of years.
[00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:21.209]  Increased M3, the highest I saw, was 17.5%.
[00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:28.174]  And usually that will relegate into about 13.5%.
[00:18:28.234 --> 00:18:37.419]  Now the reason I did that was that they had to offset the effect of the deflation of assets.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.302]  The deflationary bent in the economy.
[00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:44.804]  And they've been fighting that for over four years.
[00:18:47.887 --> 00:19:00.895]  The result of that is that the deflationary drag is getting larger and stronger because more and more assets are losing their value.
[00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:05.417]  No, it's not only real estate, it's real estate bonds.
[00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:09.860]  Those are bonds with mortgages inside of them.
[00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:18.264]  And we all know who have been following things that the CDOs and SIVs have gone down precipitously in value.
[00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:23.847]  And then we look at bank balance sheets, and the balance sheets of corporations, the same thing has happened.
[00:19:24.547 --> 00:19:26.648]  Well, that's going on, which is deflationary.
[00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:37.974]  We get the Fed is pumping away, and we get this program and that program, and those banks got to be saved, and those brokerage houses, and those insurance companies.
[00:19:38.883 --> 00:19:42.586]  Even General Electric and General Motors and Chrysler, maybe even Ford.
[00:19:43.987 --> 00:19:45.869]  So that's how they're offsetting it.
[00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:49.051]  So we get the same thing, two things going on at the same time.
[00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:50.352]  A little bit of both.
[00:19:50.472 --> 00:19:52.814]  Okay, Bob Chapman with the International Forecaster.
[00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:54.736]  We'll be back with Bob after this break.
[00:19:55.416 --> 00:20:00.320]  Once again, this is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:20:08.658 --> 00:20:15.019]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:17.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.060]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.100]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.321]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:21.341 --> 00:20:22.681]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.421]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:31.483]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:31.883 --> 00:20:32.323]  Some U.S.
[00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:38.004]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:38.724 --> 00:20:42.205]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:45.206]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:10.393 --> 00:21:11.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:17.318]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:18.399]  That's right.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.001]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:28.527]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:29.048 --> 00:21:34.732]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[00:21:35.188 --> 00:21:36.729]  Yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:42.031]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:48.074]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:52.596]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:52.976 --> 00:21:53.236]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.256 --> 00:21:55.177]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:55.237 --> 00:21:55.557]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.837 --> 00:21:56.117]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:04.608]  2-2-3-7
[00:22:24.864 --> 00:22:30.989]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.

[00:22:36.393 --> 00:22:40.075]  Unlike traditional roses, they will endure as a timeless symbol of your love.
[00:22:40.395 --> 00:22:47.821]  These roses, either singles or bouquets, are sensible and affordable Valentine's Day gifts that will impress and deeply touch that special someone in your life.

[00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:07.656]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:23:08.737 --> 00:23:09.258]  You worry.
[00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.359]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:13.921]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:23:14.342 --> 00:23:16.123]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.371]  Thanks for watching!

[00:24:01.777 --> 00:24:03.498]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:24:14.155 --> 00:24:24.749]  Okay, it's Bob Dacey, back on the Alex Jones Show here on this 30th day of January 2009.
[00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.034]  We're talking with Bob Chapman, International Forecaster.
[00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:31.607]  And I've got to admit, Bob, I'm confused.
[00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:34.648]  We've got inflationary pressures all over the place.
[00:24:34.688 --> 00:24:37.729]  We've got some temporary deflation.
[00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.411]  And you've got the Chinese don't want to buy our debt anymore.
[00:24:42.511 --> 00:24:45.912]  And we've got people getting thrown out of work like nobody's business.
[00:24:46.733 --> 00:24:49.694]  And what does the average guy do?
[00:24:50.444 --> 00:24:54.948]  Well, we've been doing this and telling people what to do for a long time on the radio.
[00:24:54.968 --> 00:25:04.956]  I've been on Genesis 11 or 12 years and I knew this was coming and we got people out of the stock market in 2000 and got into gold and silver related assets.
[00:25:19.943 --> 00:25:24.005]  They've been there for the last eight or so years, profitably so.
[00:25:24.986 --> 00:25:37.473]  But I want to finish answering that, and I hope that people understand that we simultaneously have deflation and inflation going on.
[00:25:38.193 --> 00:25:48.779]  Enough inflation to smother deflation, to keep it down, to keep it from raising its ugly, irretrievable head.
[00:25:49.284 --> 00:25:52.506]  Because once it takes over, it's dreadful.
[00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:56.209]  I mean, everything just shrivels up and dies.
[00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:09.919]  Ultimately, historically, we find that in inflationary binges like the one we're seeing now, it goes on and all of a sudden, for some reason, it stops.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:16.504]  And usually that reason is borrowers stop borrowing and lenders
[00:26:17.048 --> 00:26:20.869]  You can't really find anybody to borrow, lend to.
[00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:24.390]  And so when that happens, the whole thing goes down into deflation.
[00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:25.651]  And that will happen.
[00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:27.151]  It's a ways away.
[00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:28.292]  I don't know how far.
[00:26:28.972 --> 00:26:37.234]  But what you have is a problem that's being surmounted in the short term, and it's for the last four or five years now.
[00:26:37.975 --> 00:26:41.036]  And that is a short term in economic history.
[00:26:42.236 --> 00:26:43.917]  You have this suppressionary process.
[00:26:45.526 --> 00:27:00.058]  So the deflationists and inflationists are both right, probably for different reasons, but the point is that's the way it is and it will go on that way until the system breaks and then it will go totally into deflation.
[00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:12.008]  Now to answer what people should do, first of all, hopefully people have cleared their credit card and revolving debt and they've done that, they have to get
[00:27:12.688 --> 00:27:15.989]  Food, dehydrated freeze-dried food in a water filter.
[00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:20.470]  They should have a method of defending their family.
[00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.331]  And then after that, they should be buying gold and silver coins.
[00:27:26.091 --> 00:27:28.092]  Silver because it's a known value.
[00:27:29.152 --> 00:27:34.754]  Things like the American Eagle or 90% junk silver, as it's called.
[00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:39.575]  And gold coins, because the only true money
[00:27:40.763 --> 00:27:48.685]  Is gold in all the currencies in the world of fiat with the exception of the euro which is about now about 7% backing in gold.
[00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:51.726]  Otherwise, as far as I know, there are no others.
[00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:56.888]  So the whole world essentially has... The euro is 93% fiat, 7% real?
[00:27:56.988 --> 00:27:59.809]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:28:00.489 --> 00:28:01.429]  Yes.
[00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:08.131]  And so anyway, all currencies are going to be devalued and it's going to be massive default.
[00:28:08.883 --> 00:28:10.864]  I don't know when, but it is going to happen.
[00:28:12.045 --> 00:28:14.347]  And we're well on our way to that.
[00:28:14.367 --> 00:28:29.417]  And if you look at charts, to make it simple, you'll see where over a period of time, the last five years, that all currencies have steadily, in different degrees, gone down against gold.
[00:28:30.718 --> 00:28:32.899]  And that is the proof of the pudding right there.
[00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:34.680]  And that is going to continue.
[00:28:35.561 --> 00:28:37.082]  And that's why it's so important.
[00:28:37.597 --> 00:28:38.898]  To be in gold and silver.
[00:28:39.658 --> 00:28:54.007]  And so, beyond keeping your job, trying to get rid of debt, getting prepared for the day that you might lose your job, and I expect 30% or more of Americans will be out of work and 15% are out already.
[00:28:55.177 --> 00:28:57.978]  Again, you can't use the government statistics, because they don't tell you the truth.
[00:28:57.998 --> 00:28:59.098]  You don't believe the government?
[00:28:59.498 --> 00:29:01.799]  The government doesn't say that?
[00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:01.999]  Hardly.
[00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:02.279]  No.
[00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:09.642]  Isn't the rule of thumb, if they want to downplay something, you multiply it by a factor of three, and you're probably about right?
[00:29:10.962 --> 00:29:14.444]  So, what is the official unemployment statistic from the U.S.
[00:29:14.484 --> 00:29:14.824]  government?
[00:29:15.664 --> 00:29:16.504]  Well, they have three of them.
[00:29:17.164 --> 00:29:17.685]  Three of them?
[00:29:17.885 --> 00:29:20.606]  And one of them is the short term that you read about, the 7.2%.
[00:29:22.504 --> 00:29:25.387]  Then I have another one called U3, which is long-term.
[00:29:26.268 --> 00:29:30.593]  And their long-term figure is 15%.
[00:29:31.093 --> 00:29:35.338]  And then you have the intermediate term, which is U6, which they're calling a 12.75%.
[00:29:35.658 --> 00:29:39.061]  And even they're lying about that.
[00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:39.702]  Alright, hang on.
[00:29:39.722 --> 00:29:40.503]  We'll be back in a bit.
[00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:01.693]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.614 --> 00:30:05.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.618 --> 00:30:10.719]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:30:15.512 --> 00:30:17.275]  Healthy, delicious, easy fix food.
[00:30:17.616 --> 00:30:21.924]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:33.908]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you will understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[00:30:34.329 --> 00:30:40.896]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[00:30:41.376 --> 00:30:42.838]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:30:43.298 --> 00:30:47.303]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing
[00:30:50.322 --> 00:30:54.043]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:17.634]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:24.283]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:33.436]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:40.606]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:43.968]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:44.088 --> 00:31:49.293]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:31:49.853 --> 00:31:52.495]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:31:52.936 --> 00:31:59.661]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.867]  I suppose the government sponsored terror.
[00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.801]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:13.072]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[00:32:13.272 --> 00:32:21.674]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:32:21.914 --> 00:32:26.595]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:32:26.815 --> 00:32:33.617]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[00:32:33.877 --> 00:32:40.103]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[00:32:40.283 --> 00:32:56.038]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits, improve taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[00:32:56.198 --> 00:32:59.744]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[00:32:59.984 --> 00:33:01.988]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:33:02.008 --> 00:33:02.328]  That's 908-691-2608.
[00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:27.988]  Alright, Bob Dacey, back on the Alex Jones Show, talking with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[00:33:28.108 --> 00:33:31.509]  We were discussing the true unemployment rate.
[00:33:31.569 --> 00:33:33.090]  Bob, you want to finish up with that thought?
[00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.811]  What is the true unemployment rate right now?
[00:33:36.451 --> 00:33:48.776]  Well, I think the fairest figure to use is the U6 figure, which comes in, in government numbers, at 12.75%, and it includes short-term employment as well as people
[00:33:49.355 --> 00:33:54.456]  Who, in the recent past, have stopped receiving state unemployment checks.
[00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:57.537]  And that figure is, of course, Mickey Mouse.
[00:33:58.557 --> 00:34:01.858]  I have that figure at 15%, not 12 and 3 quarter percent.
[00:34:02.438 --> 00:34:03.538]  And that's where I come up at the 15%.
[00:34:03.658 --> 00:34:10.240]  If you go to the long term numbers, they're calling them 15%, when in fact they're about 17 and 3 quarter percent.
[00:34:12.972 --> 00:34:17.433]  And then every day I see more and more people getting laid off by the droves, right?
[00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:20.514]  I mean, every day in the paper there's several thousand more.
[00:34:21.355 --> 00:34:25.396]  And, you know, it continues to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:34:28.557 --> 00:34:30.477]  You're talking about a depression here, right?
[00:34:30.498 --> 00:34:31.398]  That's what you're talking about.
[00:34:32.158 --> 00:34:33.378]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:34:33.398 --> 00:34:41.561]  I think the only one I've seen alluded to that is the chief economist from Merrill Lynch, David Rosenberg.
[00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:52.251]  And he is, he hasn't said it that for sure we are, but all the telltale signs are there.
[00:34:52.311 --> 00:35:03.074]  So this time around, I have somebody who has economic stature with a large firm saying almost the same thing that I am.
[00:35:03.494 --> 00:35:06.375]  He's not sure we're there yet, but we're very close.
[00:35:06.955 --> 00:35:07.715]  I know we're in it.
[00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:22.265]  Well, you know, you're talking about one of the things you need to do in order to protect yourself from this type of a financial environment, or actually a world environment, is to, you know, collect gold and silver in physical possession.
[00:35:22.285 --> 00:35:26.628]  It just so happens that we have Ted Anderson on the line.
[00:35:26.668 --> 00:35:27.289]  Ted, are you there?
[00:35:27.909 --> 00:35:38.276]  Yeah, I guess if you want to call it the line, I'm in studio up here in Genesis Communications Network, and I've just been listening to the show and watching the economic things pass by here.
[00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:45.721]  Bob, I mean, gold today has been as high as $9.2980, or $9.2960.
[00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:51.905]  It's almost seen $9.30 today, and that's up currently right now at $16.70.
[00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:54.626]  Silver's up too.
[00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:56.327]  It's a hot trading day.
[00:35:56.387 --> 00:36:00.750]  I can tell you we've got a lot of people that are buying, and they should be too.
[00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:06.313]  I mean, just with the Fed threatening to buy a lot more U.S.
[00:36:06.393 --> 00:36:08.094]  Treasuries to take printed money
[00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:09.541]  And to buy U.S.
[00:36:09.621 --> 00:36:28.410]  Treasuries, the way if you define that by what's going on, that means that the United States citizens are printing all this money, we're giving it to the Federal Reserve System, hypothetically, and they're going to come in and buy Treasuries, which means they're going to lend it back to us, and they're going to do enough of that to try to stimulate the economy.
[00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:33.492]  Oh my God, I've been just like looking at it going, okay, so now we're going to be on the hook for how much in taxes?
[00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:35.553]  To service the interest on this debt?
[00:36:35.953 --> 00:36:44.441]  I mean, I know Bob, you know, you look at this stuff and it baffles me to even think that the public is stupid enough to buy into this thing.
[00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:46.483]  It just drives me crazy.
[00:36:46.503 --> 00:36:58.114]  Well, I understand that I'm going to get me a big ol' block of government cheese and a big, big ol' flagging of government wine and I'll just be able to sit around all day long eating my government cheese and drinking my wine and I won't have anything to worry about because they're going to bail me out, right?
[00:36:59.173 --> 00:37:00.714]  That's the way I see it.
[00:37:00.754 --> 00:37:01.314]  Bob, go ahead.
[00:37:01.354 --> 00:37:02.655]  I'm sorry for interrupting, man.
[00:37:02.695 --> 00:37:07.578]  No, I was going to say, if you do that and you drink too much wine, you might have some liver problems.
[00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:12.421]  Well, then I'll get me some free government health care, then.
[00:37:13.642 --> 00:37:17.904]  Well, I don't know about that, and whether you get it or not remains to be seen.
[00:37:18.685 --> 00:37:19.966]  Oh, you'll get it.
[00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:27.373]  Uh, you might have to wait in line for a long time like they do in Canada or in other places.
[00:37:27.473 --> 00:37:28.013]  You'll get it.
[00:37:28.054 --> 00:37:29.615]  Maybe not where you want it, but you'll get it.
[00:37:29.635 --> 00:37:31.216]  Yeah.
[00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:41.042]  Well, um, this is an extraordinary day in gold and silver and it has been extraordinary, uh, for the past week or so.
[00:37:41.282 --> 00:37:51.009]  And in the forecaster, uh, we told everybody, uh, about two weeks ago to go all in, uh, everything you've got going to gold and silver.
[00:37:51.767 --> 00:37:52.267]  I don't know.
[00:38:20.953 --> 00:38:22.134]  From time to time, right Ted?
[00:38:32.574 --> 00:38:42.523]  But yeah, indeed, I've got people that are buying from England, people that are buying from Australia, Germany, Japan, I mean, just all over the world.
[00:38:42.543 --> 00:38:45.946]  The main reason is, is they're having a harder time buying it locally.
[00:38:45.966 --> 00:38:51.251]  They'd prefer to have me ship it to them overseas because there's nobody that has the stuff.
[00:38:52.011 --> 00:38:59.178]  You know, and I'm in there buying, you know, I told Alex I'm carrying this deal at about, the cost on the stuff was right around
[00:39:00.047 --> 00:39:05.328]  When gold was at $8.30 is when I locked in on these Franks and British Sovereigns.
[00:39:06.388 --> 00:39:08.208]  And I still have just a few of those left.
[00:39:08.368 --> 00:39:09.929]  I've repriced what I have now.
[00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:14.650]  Looking at Franks, I have them at $2.14 on this deal.
[00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.610]  But if I'm in the marketplace trying to get them, they're $2.32.
[00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:24.131]  What I really feel good about is the people that took advantage of my deal just before that, when I bought them at $700.
[00:39:24.591 --> 00:39:27.512]  Now those people are able to sell them back to me at a nice profit.
[00:39:27.552 --> 00:39:28.312]  They were buying them at $2.02.
[00:39:29.662 --> 00:39:41.525]  And the market's much higher than that on the buy side of the market, which is just unheard of that within one week's time of buying something, you can actually sell them back and take a nice little profit.
[00:39:41.565 --> 00:39:46.946]  But I don't think you should, because what's going on in the marketplace here, you better hold on to this stuff.
[00:39:47.226 --> 00:39:50.607]  But then what I do have right now is I do have the Sovereign.
[00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:51.807]  It's at $2.63.
[00:39:52.328 --> 00:39:53.488]  And I have the Frank at $2.14.
[00:39:54.068 --> 00:39:57.969]  I challenge anybody to look anywhere in the United States or across the globe
[00:39:58.379 --> 00:40:02.562]  And find those coins for less, you won't, because the market price is up much higher.
[00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:05.324]  And the other thing, Bob mentioned junk silver.
[00:40:05.384 --> 00:40:07.526]  We have a fairly good supply of junk silver.
[00:40:07.946 --> 00:40:09.427]  I really recommend that stuff.
[00:40:09.728 --> 00:40:11.229]  We also have the Mercury Dimes.
[00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:12.910]  I'm out of the Walking Liberty halves.
[00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.991]  I've completely sold out.
[00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:18.074]  Last time I was on air, we were talking about the Buffalo coin.
[00:40:18.474 --> 00:40:20.235]  I am 100% sold out on those.
[00:40:20.315 --> 00:40:23.878]  I can't get enough to even fill an order for one right now.
[00:40:24.318 --> 00:40:25.179]  And that's how the market is.
[00:40:26.598 --> 00:40:27.938]  The gold prices are rising.
[00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:39.883]  There's no question about it that every time that happens, not only just to bite us resources, but to every gold dealer across the world, they've got a lot of customers coming the door trying to buy.
[00:40:40.143 --> 00:40:42.344]  And that happens every time the market goes up.
[00:40:42.804 --> 00:40:48.386]  So I would suggest if you're at all interested in gold, now's the time to be getting in.
[00:40:49.995 --> 00:40:51.176]  Yeah, if you can get a hold of it, right?
[00:40:51.196 --> 00:40:53.879]  I mean, Ted, you seem to be able to get a hold of it when other people can't.
[00:40:54.599 --> 00:41:04.028]  I've seen all these statistics about, well, you know, you order some stuff, and maybe five or six weeks from now, maybe you'll get it, because they really don't have it yet, and they've got to go scramble around finding it.
[00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:11.355]  Well, you know, dealers can afford to do that in a soft market, and they always know they can get the material.
[00:41:11.575 --> 00:41:12.817]  Right now, I don't trust that.
[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:20.755]  I'm out buying right now, and when gold dropped down there at that $870 level, I said it right on air.
[00:41:20.816 --> 00:41:22.457]  I said, Alex, I'm buying right now.
[00:41:23.217 --> 00:41:33.805]  I'm accumulating, and this stuff is going to be in my warehouse, in my safe, so it's available for delivery when people want to take advantage of it.
[00:41:34.186 --> 00:41:35.727]  And I'm counting on the fact.
[00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:41.050]  The downside to that is, is that what if gold goes down and I'm sitting on a big position?
[00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:49.633]  But the flip side to that is how many problems do we actually have going on in the United States and across the world right now?
[00:41:49.973 --> 00:41:58.856]  The central banks are doing everything in their power to try to suppress the prices of gold and silver because they want people to stay on their fiat currency, their printing.
[00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:11.458]  But the laws of physics will have it here that the demand for gold is much stronger than the central banks are able to suppress it.
[00:42:11.919 --> 00:42:19.885]  And so even though they're one of the largest holders of physical gold in the world, they don't even want to sell it themselves.
[00:42:19.905 --> 00:42:23.107]  They know their currencies are doomed.
[00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:25.369]  They're right at the end of the rope on this stuff.
[00:42:25.449 --> 00:42:28.031]  And so anyways, yeah, if you're interested,
[00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:32.985]  Uh, Midas Resources, you can reach us at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:42:33.385 --> 00:42:43.615]  Uh, probably one of the best deals that I have that I'm offering right now is that Creature from Jekyll Island book, and you get a silver dollar in it.
[00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:49.580]  It's $26.45, and that'll at least get you one silver dollar for you to keep.
[00:42:50.141 --> 00:42:52.263]  I'm suggesting, and you can do what you want,
[00:42:52.731 --> 00:43:01.455]  Is that you pick up the book from us, keep the silver dollar, read the book, and then find at least one other person that needs to read that book and give it to them.
[00:43:01.495 --> 00:43:04.457]  That's about central banking, how money comes into existence.
[00:43:04.877 --> 00:43:13.541]  If the entire United States knew how this system worked right now, that system would be thrown out on its ear and we'd be back to constitutional money.
[00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:15.762]  Everybody's, you know, they want answers.
[00:43:16.232 --> 00:43:20.738]  And they're not getting it from the mainstream media, and this is one of the ways to do that.
[00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:34.374]  The other thing too, I gotta say, starting Monday, Bob's newsletter, that International Forecaster, which explains this very well, and also that creature from Jekyll Island spot that you're hearing on Genesis Communications Network,
[00:43:34.684 --> 00:43:40.346]  We'll be playing on Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, George Norrie.
[00:43:40.446 --> 00:43:53.491]  I'm already playing it on the talk radio network shows like Laura Ingram and Humphreys and their lineup.
[00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:56.412]  And I've got it going on several other locations.
[00:43:56.793 --> 00:44:01.675]  And the main thing is, I think, really more than anything else, the country's hungry for answers.
[00:44:01.755 --> 00:44:02.735]  Now they need to get them.
[00:44:04.306 --> 00:44:06.467]  And they're not going to get them from the mainstream media.
[00:44:06.487 --> 00:44:15.189]  They really need to know what this Federal Reserve thing is about in central banking and actually how it affects our economy and our liberties.
[00:44:15.249 --> 00:44:15.949]  That's the main thing.
[00:44:16.009 --> 00:44:17.670]  Our liberties are just being slipped away.
[00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:22.051]  I don't know why they think the answer is more government and less liberty.
[00:44:22.411 --> 00:44:23.991]  That's not what needs to occur.
[00:44:24.251 --> 00:44:26.212]  We need more liberty and less government.
[00:44:26.252 --> 00:44:27.872]  Let the market take care of itself.
[00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:29.196]  All these bailouts.
[00:44:29.236 --> 00:44:35.199]  I mean, I'm hearing the Republicans and Democrats from both sides talking about how we need more bailout and, you know, it needs to be done this way.
[00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:38.400]  They're arguing over the details of how the money should be doled out.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.941]  I mean, they should be doing it in the first place.
[00:44:40.961 --> 00:44:42.762]  I mean, that's just my opinion.
[00:44:42.782 --> 00:44:44.722]  I know that I'm in the minority right now.
[00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:47.604]  About 80% of the people want a bailout right now.
[00:44:48.504 --> 00:44:51.505]  Less than, I think it was less than 20% wanted it before.
[00:44:51.885 --> 00:44:56.427]  But George Bush was saying that as soon as Barack Obama came up with a bailout plan,
[00:44:56.823 --> 00:44:57.944]  Now 80% want it.
[00:44:58.004 --> 00:44:59.044]  I mean, go figure.
[00:44:59.084 --> 00:44:59.905]  It's the same thing.
[00:44:59.925 --> 00:45:03.366]  I think that has something to do with sheeple, I think there, Ted.
[00:45:03.406 --> 00:45:07.848]  You know, they're following a little, meh, meh, me too.
[00:45:07.988 --> 00:45:09.669]  You know, I want some bailout.
[00:45:09.929 --> 00:45:12.591]  You know, I'm a small businessman and I'm not going to get any kind of bailout.
[00:45:12.731 --> 00:45:14.091]  I'm going to get nothing.
[00:45:14.792 --> 00:45:15.112]  You know?
[00:45:17.768 --> 00:45:19.850]  I just laugh about it.
[00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:27.736]  The whole ethic of our whole society is that, well, gee, just print up some money and paper over the problems and don't attack the cause of the problem.
[00:45:27.776 --> 00:45:30.418]  Just paper it over with more money and everything will be just fine.
[00:45:30.698 --> 00:45:34.521]  They just keep shoving the consequences further on down the line.
[00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:39.404]  And the more they pile them up, the worse they're going to be when the thing finally goes kaflooey.
[00:45:40.105 --> 00:45:46.990]  Yeah, well, at least I know that you're smart enough to get away from this paper fiat currency that we have.
[00:45:47.452 --> 00:45:51.153]  I know Bob is, and I certainly am, and I know that a lot of the people out there have.
[00:45:51.713 --> 00:45:57.335]  I just have to say at this particular time, the warning bells are ringing and it's more like a siren blasting the horn.
[00:45:57.815 --> 00:45:58.815]  Now is the time to move.
[00:45:58.895 --> 00:46:09.718]  And if you're interested in finding out more, if you really don't understand the system, and I know there's a lot of people that are out there listening to Bob Chapman and scratching their head going, what the world is he talking about?
[00:46:09.878 --> 00:46:12.619]  I don't quite understand what he's talking about here and why.
[00:46:13.339 --> 00:46:16.860]  That creature from Jekyll Island book lays it out pretty much in black and white.
[00:46:17.361 --> 00:46:21.203]  And for $26.45, the retail price on this thing is $24.
[00:46:22.624 --> 00:46:25.825]  Now with silver where it is, silver dollars up over $20 a piece.
[00:46:26.105 --> 00:46:28.147]  You add it up, it's like about $40, $45 worth of product.
[00:46:28.227 --> 00:46:31.228]  And you put the postage on there, it gets up to $50 and I'm selling it for $26.45.
[00:46:31.268 --> 00:46:33.689]  I just, I don't know how I can make a better deal for you.
[00:46:41.926 --> 00:46:48.512]  Ted, would you say that the reason why, there's this big decoupling between the price of physical metal and the paper price.
[00:46:49.072 --> 00:46:53.897]  You know, you read in the paper that silver is whatever it is, 11 or 12 bucks, and you're selling that the coins are 20.
[00:46:54.277 --> 00:47:01.464]  This huge discrepancy between what used to be a bullion coin, which was supposed to kind of closely follow the value of, say, silver.
[00:47:02.045 --> 00:47:06.529]  This huge discrepancy, would you say, would you agree that that, the reason for that,
[00:47:13.373 --> 00:47:18.195]  Yes, because it's like fractional reserve banking.
[00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:24.819]  What they're doing is they're manipulating the spot price of silver or gold by getting into the futures market.
[00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:27.540]  And I know Bob would agree with this too.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:34.604]  It's the futures market that's causing the spot price to dip when it does, and that just means that
[00:47:35.097 --> 00:47:40.320]  You know, somebody's in there selling a lot of the time short, meaning selling something that they don't even have.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.281]  I don't know, Bob, why don't you touch on that one?
[00:47:43.461 --> 00:47:45.722]  Well, mostly it's the United States government.
[00:47:46.943 --> 00:47:50.825]  On the comics, they have what are called commercials, and these are the pros pros.
[00:47:51.845 --> 00:47:54.046]  And the commercials run the market.
[00:47:54.166 --> 00:47:55.387]  They're supposed to know everything.
[00:47:56.287 --> 00:47:58.128]  And not too long ago, they were short.
[00:47:58.268 --> 00:48:00.589]  They were betting gold was going to go down.
[00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.230]  And they were wrong.
[00:48:02.911 --> 00:48:03.671]  And they obviously
[00:48:04.173 --> 00:48:05.294]  You know, took some losses.
[00:48:06.055 --> 00:48:14.262]  What their relationship is with the United States government, we don't know, because the United States government nor the commercials will tell us.
[00:48:15.182 --> 00:48:20.127]  But again, now they're short big, and they're getting their heads handed to them again.
[00:48:20.807 --> 00:48:26.152]  Gold is trading close to 928 right now, up 23 or so dollars.
[00:48:26.672 --> 00:48:29.575]  Silver's up 41 cents, so they've got a problem.
[00:48:30.035 --> 00:48:32.377]  But what happens is that
[00:48:33.058 --> 00:48:47.621]  On the futures trading market, that historically less than 1% of those who took a contract on the long side of the market, betting that the price would go up, took delivery.
[00:48:48.381 --> 00:49:01.643]  Now that figure, we guess, is somewhere between 16 and 20%, which means that the COMEX probably has to go someplace else and borrow either gold or silver.
[00:49:02.199 --> 00:49:10.061]  But we're primarily talking about gold here in order to fulfill the demand for the forward long contracts.
[00:49:11.241 --> 00:49:16.623]  And if people continue to do that, it's going to put a squeeze on the comics exchange.
[00:49:17.523 --> 00:49:22.204]  And we expect that that is going to happen over the coming months.
[00:49:22.264 --> 00:49:23.444]  And it has already begun.
[00:49:24.185 --> 00:49:29.706]  January, December was a big month for contract deliveries.
[00:49:30.566 --> 00:49:40.790]  And of course you have comics on there screaming to the client, the customer, you know, we don't want you to take delivery.
[00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.230]  And they're making it as difficult as possible.
[00:49:44.091 --> 00:49:47.192]  But that is not a real market if you can't get delivery.
[00:49:48.172 --> 00:49:49.253]  And this is what's going on.
[00:49:49.273 --> 00:49:58.776]  And sooner or later, if enough delivery is taken over the next several months, they're going to have to either borrow gold and silver, or they're going to have to shut down.
[00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:02.783]  And I think that's what we're headed for, but it's a make-believe market.
[00:50:03.464 --> 00:50:10.129]  It's just a market where people trade things, in this case gold and silver, with no intention of ever taking delivery.
[00:50:10.489 --> 00:50:12.671]  Physical market's totally different.
[00:50:13.592 --> 00:50:14.853]  I mean, you buy it or you don't.
[00:50:15.533 --> 00:50:16.294]  It's pretty simple.
[00:50:16.994 --> 00:50:25.081]  And right now, people all over the world are scrambling to get out of their currencies to buy gold and silver in one form or another.
[00:50:26.562 --> 00:50:28.944]  And that's going to continue, and it's going to heighten
[00:50:29.775 --> 00:50:37.640]  And this is going to go on for two or three years until the inflationary aspect of what central banks are doing and just not the Fed.
[00:50:39.221 --> 00:50:40.522]  The G20 is doing it.
[00:50:42.883 --> 00:50:43.583]  I hear the music.
[00:50:43.944 --> 00:50:46.125]  Yeah, that music means we're going to have another break.
[00:50:47.186 --> 00:50:48.126]  This is Bob Dacey.
[00:50:48.146 --> 00:50:50.448]  I'm substituting on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:50.488 --> 00:50:54.850]  We've got Bob Chapman on the line and also have Ted Anderson and Midas Resources.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:03.711]  Want to go to 1-888-294-6187 and talk to the guys at Modest Resources in order to get some of that gold while you still can.
[00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:05.474]  Be back after the break.
[00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:12.018]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:51:12.279 --> 00:51:14.641]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[00:51:14.761 --> 00:51:15.422]  Guaranteed!

[00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:19.031]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:19.531 --> 00:52:20.071]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:20.352 --> 00:52:21.332]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:21.352 --> 00:52:22.673]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:22.693 --> 00:52:24.374]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:24.695 --> 00:52:31.459]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.300]  Some U.S.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:37.964]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:38.664 --> 00:52:42.167]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:42.187 --> 00:52:44.969]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:08.468 --> 00:53:12.091]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:53:12.171 --> 00:53:17.815]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:53:17.895 --> 00:53:21.958]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:53:22.239 --> 00:53:24.540]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.

[00:53:30.745 --> 00:53:31.185]  I don't know.

[00:54:19.552 --> 00:54:25.235]  Okay, Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:25.275 --> 00:54:27.516]  We've got Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster.
[00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:30.217]  That's TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:54:30.357 --> 00:54:31.998]  It's going to go to the website.
[00:54:32.018 --> 00:54:34.279]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:38.240]  And we also have Ted Anderson with Modest Resources.
[00:54:38.681 --> 00:54:41.582]  Another phone number you can use to call Ted Anderson is 1-800-686-2237.
[00:54:41.602 --> 00:54:41.662]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.606]  Well, guys, we've got a big mess on our hands.
[00:54:50.626 --> 00:54:51.447]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:54:54.429 --> 00:54:54.709]  Ted?
[00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.131]  Yeah, I'll step in right away.
[00:54:57.331 --> 00:55:02.635]  I was waiting there for Bob to, you know, the only thing that I can think of is educating the people.
[00:55:03.776 --> 00:55:08.740]  I know that Bob might have some other answers, too, but, you know, we're not ready.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.082]  We're not ready for real solutions yet for some reason.
[00:55:12.322 --> 00:55:18.427]  Our political mass, the people that are in Washington, D.C., by the large part, don't understand what's going on.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.601]  Nor do there's constituents that basically get them elected.
[00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:24.762]  I think you're being kind.
[00:55:25.062 --> 00:55:28.163]  You're being kind about the politicians not knowing what's going on.
[00:55:28.203 --> 00:55:29.303]  I think they're a bunch of crooks.
[00:55:29.563 --> 00:55:33.084]  Well, they are very well crooks, but I don't think they understand economics.
[00:55:33.144 --> 00:55:35.905]  I understand how to line their own pockets.
[00:55:36.065 --> 00:55:36.925]  Well, that's true.
[00:55:37.325 --> 00:55:40.686]  And they'll sell us out for a dime, but the fact of the matter is,
[00:55:43.551 --> 00:56:08.936]  If you asked, you know, I was listening to Ron Paul on the Banking Committee when he's talking about all these different things, and most of these people didn't even know that the Federal Reserve was a private agency, you know, I mean, that it wasn't a branch of government, and the fiat system, the whole thing, this whole concept of what we've been sold into in 1913, which put us into the position where we now have a fiat currency system,
[00:56:09.395 --> 00:56:11.098]  And we have a federal income tax.
[00:56:11.158 --> 00:56:13.462]  We didn't have that before the system was in place.
[00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:16.748]  When the Federal Reserve System buys U.S.
[00:56:16.768 --> 00:56:17.690]  government securities,
[00:56:18.066 --> 00:56:21.068]  They're basically saying that we're going to lend the government the money.
[00:56:21.108 --> 00:56:25.292]  We owe the taxes as the citizens to pay back the interest on that debt.
[00:56:25.592 --> 00:56:27.213]  They've created this from nothing.
[00:56:27.553 --> 00:56:29.115]  They have nothing into it at all.
[00:56:29.315 --> 00:56:33.538]  There is no labor involved in printing money for nothing.
[00:56:33.798 --> 00:56:36.300]  And yet they're able to collect the interest on it.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:46.889]  And no surprise at all to me that the United States government has gotten so far into debt now that we no longer can even service the interest on the past due debt, much less take on this
[00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:50.133]  This new, uh, I don't know what, what is it?
[00:56:50.394 --> 00:56:53.699]  It's coming up on a $2 trillion bailout now.
[00:56:55.054 --> 00:56:56.095]  We just can't afford it.
[00:56:56.175 --> 00:56:59.537]  There isn't enough GDP to cover that.
[00:57:00.037 --> 00:57:06.762]  And I was just about to say before coming back from the break, you know, that International Forecaster, I did it without that F-O-R-E in there.
[00:57:07.082 --> 00:57:09.804]  And you don't end up at the internationalforecaster.com.
[00:57:09.824 --> 00:57:11.385]  So when you go in there, look at it.
[00:57:11.445 --> 00:57:15.108]  Look, it's the internationalforecaster with the E in there.com.
[00:57:15.148 --> 00:57:16.148]  And you'll get right to it.
[00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:17.950]  And there's a lot of good information there.
[00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:22.753]  And if you haven't subscribed to the International Forecaster yet, you know, I think
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.381]  I think you're losing out.
[00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:27.483]  I mean, Bob has a lot of good information in there, and you're going to get it.
[00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:28.504]  I don't know.
[00:57:28.564 --> 00:57:29.925]  Bob, you should probably cover that.
[00:57:30.585 --> 00:57:30.866]  Yeah.
[00:57:31.366 --> 00:57:34.548]  Well, we've got a few seconds left in this last segment.
[00:57:34.568 --> 00:57:36.370]  Go right ahead.
[00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:40.473]  It's all the things that you don't find in the media, things that you really need to know.
[00:57:41.273 --> 00:57:51.521]  And so you can get a free introductory copy, and you can do that by going to our site, and that addresses theinternationalforecaster.com.
[00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:53.882]  Or you can call toll free to 877-479-8178.
[00:57:53.942 --> 00:57:54.202]  That's 877-479-8178.

[00:57:59.304 --> 00:58:03.106]  And you're missing something very important if you're not a subscriber.
[00:58:16.457 --> 00:58:19.179]  Okay, Bob Chapman with the International Forecaster.
[00:58:19.199 --> 00:58:22.121]  I want to thank you very much for coming on the segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:26.104]  I think, unfortunately, the man knows what he's talking about.
[00:58:26.744 --> 00:58:30.327]  And, unfortunately, Ted Anderson also knows what he's talking about.
[00:58:31.067 --> 00:58:35.990]  In the next, last hour of the show, we're going to have Kurt Nemo coming into the studio.
[00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:37.952]  In studio, we're going to have some fun with him.
[00:58:38.032 --> 00:58:41.094]  I've never met the guy before, but we're fixing to find out.
[00:58:41.754 --> 00:58:43.155]  And we'll see you in a bit.
[00:58:50.737 --> 00:58:52.318]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:55.579]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.439 --> 00:58:59.020]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.721]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:04.862 --> 00:59:07.622]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:07.822 --> 00:59:10.683]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:10.863 --> 00:59:15.585]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:15.825 --> 00:59:16.766]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:16.946 --> 00:59:19.889]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:27.077]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:30.321]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:45.612 --> 00:59:46.973]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:46.993 --> 00:59:47.573]  Take action today.
[00:59:47.614 --> 00:59:49.435]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:01.204 --> 01:00:03.105]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:03.586 --> 01:00:06.368]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:24.363]  Well, three hours really went by fast.
[01:00:24.403 --> 01:00:26.766]  We've got one more to go.
[01:00:26.806 --> 01:00:31.431]  This is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:37.657]  Today, this 30th day of January 2009, on the Alex Jones Show on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:45.265]  This show is the tip of the spear in the fight against the New World Order, and there's no question about it.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:54.024]  Speaking of the tip of the spear, I have one of Alex Jones' writers in studio with me right now, Kurt Nemo.
[01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.866]  Just met him a little while ago.
[01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:59.727]  I admire your work, Kurt.
[01:01:00.568 --> 01:01:04.330]  I've read a whole bunch of your articles and I've learned to respect what you have to say.
[01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:06.971]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:07.692]  Thanks, Bob.
[01:01:07.952 --> 01:01:08.372]  Good to be here.
[01:01:08.886 --> 01:01:14.247]  Well, what I think we're going to do this hour, I think we're going to open it up to some potpourri.
[01:01:14.267 --> 01:01:16.948]  We're going to put out the number for phone calls.
[01:01:17.088 --> 01:01:23.289]  That number, if you want to participate in this, is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:23.449 --> 01:01:25.389]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:35.332]  If you want to participate in this thing, if you want to ask Kurt Nemo some questions or whatever you want to do, it's fine with me.
[01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.132]  Kurt, what have you been working on lately?
[01:01:38.035 --> 01:01:40.655]  Well, I'm down here in Austin to work on the website.
[01:01:40.675 --> 01:01:47.557]  We've been making some changes with Prison Planet TV and just getting up to speed and seeing the new facility.
[01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:51.217]  How did you end up getting involved with Alex to begin with?
[01:01:52.098 --> 01:02:01.879]  I listened to his radio show about four years ago and I did a political blog at the time and one thing led to another and the next thing I know I was working for the guy.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.700]  How many articles do you think you've written for InfoWars.com?
[01:02:05.894 --> 01:02:06.495]  Oh gosh.
[01:02:06.976 --> 01:02:07.336]  Hundreds.
[01:02:07.797 --> 01:02:08.598]  Hundreds.
[01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:10.281]  I don't really keep track, so I don't know.
[01:02:10.501 --> 01:02:10.962]  Exactly.
[01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:14.468]  Do you have any particular things that you're most interested in right now?
[01:02:14.508 --> 01:02:17.272]  Things that you're working on that you want to talk about?
[01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:19.896]  Well, lately we've been covering Obama.
[01:02:21.578 --> 01:02:22.319]  Obama?
[01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:25.400]  Yeah, and it kind of dovetails with Alex's latest film.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.021]  Obama?
[01:02:26.181 --> 01:02:26.841]  Wait, wait!
[01:02:27.341 --> 01:02:29.082]  I got an article right here!
[01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:31.484]  I am thrilled to death you said that.
[01:02:31.604 --> 01:02:33.845]  I got an Obama section right here in front of me.
[01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:36.746]  This is from the American Statesman the other day.
[01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:41.529]  Obama vows to achieve energy independence.
[01:02:42.169 --> 01:02:43.150]  Here's a quote from him.
[01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:48.873]  It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil.
[01:02:49.827 --> 01:02:50.847]  Wait a minute!
[01:02:51.827 --> 01:02:57.788]  Kurt, didn't he want to make sure we don't do any domestic exploration and drilling and stuff?
[01:02:58.168 --> 01:03:00.509]  Yeah, it's kind of a contradiction there, isn't it?
[01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:08.370]  Tell me, sir, how do you reduce our dependence on foreign oil if you don't let us produce domestic oil?
[01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.551]  Well, possibly we'll be using less oil in general.
[01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:15.591]  Oh, you mean possibly our standard of living is going to have to crater?
[01:03:16.612 --> 01:03:18.412]  Do you think this might be what he's saying?
[01:03:18.632 --> 01:03:19.132]  Absolutely.
[01:03:19.656 --> 01:03:21.357]  I think that's exactly what he's saying.
[01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.898]  Look, ladies and gentlemen, y'all aren't stupid.
[01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:27.480]  The fact that you listen to the Alex Jones Show means you're not stupid.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:28.961]  Figure it out.
[01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:45.069]  If they won't allow the Alaska stuff to come online, if they won't go up to Gull Island, where Lindsey Williams says there's more oil than under all of Saudi Arabia, and natural gas just pouring out of the ground, they've got to drive it back in with pumps all the time.
[01:03:45.729 --> 01:03:49.071]  If they won't let us do that, and Obama's going to keep all that stuff away from us,
[01:03:49.691 --> 01:03:54.354]  Then how in the world is this clown going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil?
[01:03:54.394 --> 01:03:59.756]  There's only one other way, ladies and gentlemen, and that is to take our standard of living and flush it down the toilet.
[01:04:00.977 --> 01:04:01.177]  Right.
[01:04:01.197 --> 01:04:02.538]  Well, that's part of the banker agenda.
[01:04:02.598 --> 01:04:06.140]  I mean, that's what the climate change thing's all about, is reducing our standard of living.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.080]  That's right.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.101]  But you know what?
[01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:10.742]  Another way to reduce things is to kill people.
[01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:17.031]  I have an article here that Obama is planning a billion-dollar bailout for the abortion industry.
[01:04:17.471 --> 01:04:17.691]  Right.
[01:04:18.512 --> 01:04:19.193]  Let me see this.
[01:04:19.253 --> 01:04:20.454]  Last week, let me read this.
[01:04:20.474 --> 01:04:24.438]  This is from OneNewsNow.com.
[01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:35.189]  About a couple of weeks ago, last week, the Obama-Biden transition project posted a report on its website that calls for the dramatic policy reversals on abortion
[01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:41.452]  Including a $1 billion in taxpayer money for international abortion groups like Planned Parenthood.
[01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:44.913]  Alright, so there you have it.
[01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:47.333]  Just kill more people and they won't be using the resources.
[01:04:47.793 --> 01:04:50.814]  Right, well we've got a bunch of eugenicists running the country, so there you go.
[01:04:50.934 --> 01:04:52.314]  Hey, that's change, isn't it?
[01:04:52.774 --> 01:04:56.975]  Alright, well right after the break we'll be back here on the Alex Jones Show with Curt Nemo.
[01:04:56.995 --> 01:05:00.076]  This is Bob Dacey, and hang on in there, we're going to take some phone calls.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.102]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:05:12.282 --> 01:05:16.344]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:05:16.525 --> 01:05:24.490]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:27.953]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:05:28.173 --> 01:05:34.058]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:05:34.318 --> 01:05:38.681]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:05:38.982 --> 01:05:46.988]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:05:47.168 --> 01:05:54.394]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and freedom of
[01:05:57.398 --> 01:06:02.121]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:03.761]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:18.201 --> 01:06:19.062]  Who is the enemy?
[01:06:19.582 --> 01:06:20.083]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:20.383 --> 01:06:21.344]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:21.364 --> 01:06:22.665]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:22.725 --> 01:06:24.387]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:24.727 --> 01:06:31.493]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:31.873 --> 01:06:32.334]  Some U.S.
[01:06:32.374 --> 01:06:37.999]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:38.699 --> 01:06:42.220]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:52.463]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:52.683 --> 01:06:53.423]  Fabled enemies.
[01:06:53.903 --> 01:07:01.185]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:01.645 --> 01:07:05.006]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:11.223]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[01:07:11.443 --> 01:07:12.543]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[01:07:12.563 --> 01:07:16.744]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[01:07:16.764 --> 01:07:19.445]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function?
[01:07:19.605 --> 01:07:21.326]  Or are you simply treating the symptoms?
[01:07:21.566 --> 01:07:31.789]  The SinuPlus Elite Advanced Sinus Irrigation System effectively cleanses your sinuses and upper airways of all fungi, bacteria, and pathogens, and clears your sinuses gently and pleasantly.
[01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:32.389]  We're good to go.
[01:08:01.909 --> 01:08:02.270]  I think so.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:15.224]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.686 --> 01:08:22.969]  Alright, we are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:22.989 --> 01:08:26.052]  This is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.512 --> 01:08:37.700]  And in studio, we have Kurt Nemo, and we were discussing Kurt Nemo's interest in our new President Obama, and I was making a comment that
[01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:40.115]  One of the first things he's done.
[01:08:40.176 --> 01:08:47.498]  Actually, I'm looking at an article from another writer for Infowars.com and for PrisonPlanet.com on Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:48.418 --> 01:08:49.579]  He wrote this a few days ago.
[01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:53.380]  Obama's first act is taxpayer money to fund abortions of black babies.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.561]  How do you like that change, y'all?
[01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:56.861]  First sentence.
[01:08:56.921 --> 01:09:02.243]  The sickest irony amidst the euphoria of the inauguration of America's first black president
[01:09:03.107 --> 01:09:14.331]  is that one of Obama's very first actions in office will be to ensure that millions more black babies are aborted in third world countries with American taxpayers picking up the tab.
[01:09:14.831 --> 01:09:18.113]  Kurt, what do you think about that?
[01:09:18.973 --> 01:09:26.336]  Well, I mean, this is just a trade-off on, you know, it's like a tag-team thing between the Bush administration and the Obama administration and the Clinton.
[01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:29.617]  Obama's just basically a regurgitation of the Clinton administration.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:45.823]  Uh, they have their social policies, you know, their social, uh, you know, and part of that is, for the so-called liberals, if you want to use their false right-left paradigm, is abortion, or choice, as they call it.
[01:09:45.843 --> 01:09:46.423]  It's choice.
[01:09:46.763 --> 01:09:48.063]  It's not abortion, it's choice.
[01:09:48.503 --> 01:09:56.005]  You know, I always thought, you know, in my opinion, in my humble opinion, when you look at abortion, look, you have a choice.
[01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:59.504]  To kill something of your own flesh and blood?
[01:10:00.345 --> 01:10:03.448]  Or not kill something of your own flesh and blood?
[01:10:04.689 --> 01:10:16.220]  It's my belief that if your conscience was ruling your decision-making process, you'd probably feel better about not killing something of your own flesh and blood.
[01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:18.843]  Well, to them, it's tissue until it's born.
[01:10:19.063 --> 01:10:19.624]  Yeah, right.
[01:10:20.367 --> 01:10:21.248]  Right.
[01:10:21.288 --> 01:10:22.909]  Well, you know, the viability argument.
[01:10:22.929 --> 01:10:24.450]  I'm going to make lots of people mad now.
[01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:26.031]  The viability argument.
[01:10:26.311 --> 01:10:27.392]  Well, it's not viable.
[01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:28.913]  It's not viable so you can kill it.
[01:10:29.153 --> 01:10:29.813]  Well, guess what?
[01:10:29.853 --> 01:10:31.795]  It's not viable after it comes out either.
[01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:32.955]  That's right.
[01:10:33.236 --> 01:10:34.316]  So give me a break.
[01:10:34.456 --> 01:10:35.997]  And the other argument.
[01:10:36.057 --> 01:10:36.798]  I love the other.
[01:10:36.818 --> 01:10:38.059]  It's the woman's body.
[01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:40.320]  She should be able to do with it whatever she wants.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.161]  Well, guess what?
[01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:43.022]  It's no longer just her body anymore.
[01:10:43.422 --> 01:10:45.043]  That argument is ridiculous.
[01:10:45.484 --> 01:10:48.886]  Well, the whole agenda is pushed by Margaret Sanger and the
[01:10:49.468 --> 01:10:52.570]  You know, Planned Parenthood and all of that for decades.
[01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.471]  It's part of the eugenicist, you know, agenda.
[01:10:56.232 --> 01:10:57.993]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:10:58.913 --> 01:11:03.216]  You know, abortion is the thing, you never bring up abortion.
[01:11:03.416 --> 01:11:04.577]  You mix everybody mad.
[01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:09.720]  Everybody's got some skeleton in his closet somewhere they don't want to be reminded of.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.823]  A lot of people are that way and they just don't want to be reminded of it and they take it personal.
[01:11:16.698 --> 01:11:32.143]  Abortion, look, the Constitution says, or I think, what is it, the Preamble says that we're supposed to establish this Constitution to protect the life and liberty of ourselves and our posterity.
[01:11:32.643 --> 01:11:33.883]  But what is our posterity?
[01:11:35.004 --> 01:11:38.165]  I think our posterity is those who are coming after us.
[01:11:39.025 --> 01:11:45.067]  Well, I think the Founding Fathers didn't mean there was a nine-month window where you could kill our posterity.
[01:11:45.504 --> 01:11:45.784]  Right.
[01:11:46.124 --> 01:11:47.425]  I don't think that they meant that.
[01:11:48.245 --> 01:11:54.248]  But, you know, what the heck, it's a woman's body, and she can do whatever she wants, and government should butt out.
[01:11:54.448 --> 01:12:03.493]  You know, it's funny, government should butt out of a lot of things, but, you know, this thing about, you know, killing, killing,
[01:12:04.768 --> 01:12:09.491]  A little guy that's going to be maybe President of the United States one day.
[01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:10.051]  Who knows?
[01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:13.614]  If you just let things take their natural course, there's something wrong with that.
[01:12:13.674 --> 01:12:14.114]  That's all.
[01:12:14.614 --> 01:12:14.814]  Right.
[01:12:14.854 --> 01:12:15.234]  That's all.
[01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:18.076]  This is going to be pushed under the Obama administration.
[01:12:18.156 --> 01:12:22.879]  It's part of the, you know, the liberal agenda, so to speak.
[01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:24.560]  Yes, it'll be change.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.601]  It'll be change.
[01:12:25.661 --> 01:12:31.444]  When you pay the abortionist for however much he's paid to kill your baby, he'll give you some change, I guess.
[01:12:31.484 --> 01:12:31.885]  I don't know.
[01:12:32.865 --> 01:12:34.006]  Well, you want to take some phone calls?
[01:12:34.685 --> 01:12:35.726]  Sure, all right.
[01:12:35.826 --> 01:12:40.708]  We've got Leo in Massachusetts, our first caller on the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:12:40.748 --> 01:12:41.468]  Leo, are you there?
[01:12:42.448 --> 01:12:43.649]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[01:12:44.329 --> 01:12:49.131]  Yeah, would you say that abortion is a eugenicist's wet dream, so to say?
[01:12:52.113 --> 01:12:56.795]  Well, you know, it's a good way to get rid of those useless feeders before they ever start feeding, I guess.
[01:12:57.315 --> 01:13:01.777]  Actually, I take kind of a midway position and I get hammered by both sides.
[01:13:02.802 --> 01:13:10.947]  I think that after the second trimester, the fetus is viable outside of the womb and therefore should have full constitutional rights.
[01:13:11.107 --> 01:13:14.029]  I think before that, you're still a tag-along.
[01:13:15.369 --> 01:13:18.631]  You're an aspect of, rather than a separate individual.
[01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:21.833]  That's why, you know, it's a controversial position to take.
[01:13:21.993 --> 01:13:22.393]  Oh, it is, it is.
[01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:25.415]  I disagree with you in a friendly manner.
[01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:29.818]  You know, I have the unique ability to disagree with people in a friendly manner.
[01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.899]  I don't sit there and yell and scream at them.
[01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:34.300]  Because I'm partially in your camp, is what you're saying.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.182]  My deal there is, where do you draw the line?
[01:13:37.222 --> 01:13:43.006]  If you take this nine month gestation period, you know, and you say, okay, let's draw a graph here.
[01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:47.048]  Okay, we're viable right here, we're not viable right here.
[01:13:47.388 --> 01:13:51.931]  It's okay to kill them at this point, but 24 hours later it's not okay to kill them.
[01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:55.033]  Yeah, I know the complexities you're adding into it.
[01:13:55.093 --> 01:13:58.395]  My deal is that, is the benefit of the doubt argument?
[01:13:58.995 --> 01:14:01.878]  You know, and also, I would like to interview the fetus.
[01:14:02.558 --> 01:14:03.459]  Right, right.
[01:14:03.479 --> 01:14:05.300]  Anyway, can I get back to Mr. Nemo?
[01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:06.441]  Sure, go right ahead.
[01:14:06.821 --> 01:14:09.003]  I understand you were a graphics person before.
[01:14:09.023 --> 01:14:09.644]  Is this true?
[01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:10.825]  Yes, I was.
[01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:13.587]  And where did you live before you moved out west?
[01:14:14.448 --> 01:14:15.308]  I lived in Chicago.
[01:14:16.509 --> 01:14:18.751]  Oh, and the Zionists chased you out of there, huh?
[01:14:20.092 --> 01:14:21.413]  No, they didn't chase me out of there.
[01:14:21.453 --> 01:14:22.274]  What makes you think that?
[01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:26.097]  I heard you were getting certain threats by certain peoples.
[01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:27.481]  Yes, I was.
[01:14:27.841 --> 01:14:33.624]  When I criticized Israel, I did get some pretty pernicious threats, but that's water under the bridge at this point.
[01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:37.925]  Well, I mean, would you have stayed there if that hadn't happened?
[01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:39.786]  No, that didn't have anything to do with it.
[01:14:39.826 --> 01:14:51.130]  I decided to move out of Chicago because, quite frankly, I was a web designer and the job market pretty much vanished in Chicago when the so-called internet bubble burst in the early 2000s, late 90s.
[01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:57.417]  But hasn't the web design been shipped out to India and China now?
[01:14:58.157 --> 01:14:59.757]  Pretty much for larger corporations.
[01:14:59.817 --> 01:15:03.858]  I started working for local firms in southern New Mexico.
[01:15:03.998 --> 01:15:07.778]  So I got a job there and I'm working for Alex Jones.
[01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.779]  Great.
[01:15:09.819 --> 01:15:12.959]  Welcome to the club and I'm glad you're hitched up with a good guy.
[01:15:12.979 --> 01:15:23.381]  I just think that I want Alex to do more of a NPR voice on a regular basis just to
[01:15:23.908 --> 01:15:26.691]  Cool himself out and make fun of NPR.
[01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:27.852]  I think he could do both.
[01:15:28.593 --> 01:15:32.556]  I worry about him getting a heart attack from just jumping around like that and freaking out.
[01:15:32.757 --> 01:15:34.218]  Well, Leo, I'll tell you what.
[01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:35.199]  I want to thank you for the call.
[01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:35.900]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.041]  I want to comment on that.
[01:15:37.862 --> 01:15:44.328]  I have known Alex since, I guess, November of 98, when he first came into my store.
[01:15:45.456 --> 01:15:47.197]  And uh... that ain't gonna happen.
[01:15:48.857 --> 01:16:02.262]  Alex is Alex and uh... what you see there is what you get you know and the guy you know he he what he projects is what he feels and he's like a bull in a china closet and it's not going to change.
[01:16:02.282 --> 01:16:08.665]  Now he can do really good imitations and other voices and what not for fun but uh... what you see is what you get with Alex.
[01:16:08.825 --> 01:16:14.167]  People always love to criticize Alex because he's so in your face
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.261]  But look where it's got him.
[01:16:17.301 --> 01:16:23.523]  The guy is the tip of the spear of the whole dadgum freedom movement in the United States and people criticize him for it.
[01:16:23.923 --> 01:16:24.183]  Right?
[01:16:24.483 --> 01:16:24.964]  Exactly.
[01:16:25.064 --> 01:16:29.305]  And, okay, great, wonderful, criticizing for it, but you can't argue with success.
[01:16:29.325 --> 01:16:34.587]  You know, I'm sitting here in this studio, this state-of-the-art, fantastic
[01:16:35.402 --> 01:16:37.703]  Combination radio, TV studio.
[01:16:37.984 --> 01:16:39.344]  It's going all over the world.
[01:16:39.584 --> 01:16:40.385]  Millions of people.
[01:16:40.665 --> 01:16:46.949]  He's going to be rebroadcasting it four more times, I guess, or five more times or whatever before the next one pops up.
[01:16:47.949 --> 01:16:51.351]  You know, he's got all these websites with millions and millions and millions of hits.
[01:16:51.811 --> 01:16:53.072]  He's got all these documentaries.
[01:16:53.112 --> 01:16:55.814]  And by the way, you need to buy Alex Jones's documentaries.
[01:16:55.874 --> 01:17:00.997]  I gotta plug Alex Jones's documentaries and the other ones that are on there too.
[01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:05.019]  For example, I think one of the best documentaries produced
[01:17:05.945 --> 01:17:07.686]  Is Lose Change Final Cut.
[01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:12.069]  That's the one that Jason Burmiss and Dylan Avery did, and Cory Rowe.
[01:17:12.329 --> 01:17:14.450]  And that you can get on Alex Jones' website.
[01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:15.891]  Lose Change Final Cut.
[01:17:16.151 --> 01:17:19.393]  And one of the reasons why it's one of the best ones out there is because I'm in it!
[01:17:19.453 --> 01:17:20.113]  How about that?
[01:17:20.833 --> 01:17:21.634]  Shameless plug.
[01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:24.575]  You know, so, that one's a great one.
[01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:25.896]  Endgame's fantastic.
[01:17:26.957 --> 01:17:28.798]  I remember when one of the older films,
[01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:31.811]  9-1-1 Road to Tyranny came out.
[01:17:32.131 --> 01:17:37.273]  Absolutely, that was like a quantum leap in Alex's production ability.
[01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:39.714]  It's just a fantastic film about September 11th.
[01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:51.719]  You know, just in-game, whatever, you name it, you go to InfoWars.com and click on the shop button and buy some of Alex's stuff because they need the money to keep on doing this.
[01:17:51.779 --> 01:17:59.282]  And by the way, a few weeks ago I was riding shotgun with Jason Vermas and some caller called in and was griping about
[01:17:59.953 --> 01:18:06.317]  Alex Jones hijacking the freedom movement and the money aspect of it, and I just thought it was funny.
[01:18:06.357 --> 01:18:07.998]  You think all this stuff is cheap?
[01:18:08.978 --> 01:18:10.419]  You know, I'm lucky.
[01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:13.781]  My TV show is just pure volunteer.
[01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:20.665]  It's kind of like, you know, Alex is like a professional soldier in this battle, and I'm the militia.
[01:18:21.365 --> 01:18:22.546]  You know, I show up when I can.
[01:18:22.586 --> 01:18:24.247]  I gotta go tend the store.
[01:18:24.888 --> 01:18:28.570]  But man, I tell you what, you can't say enough good about Alex Jones.
[01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:30.652]  I hear so many people saying bad things about him.
[01:18:31.372 --> 01:18:33.453]  I guess, you know, when you're... what's the old expression?
[01:18:33.494 --> 01:18:35.675]  When you're over the target... Over the target, you get the flag.
[01:18:35.695 --> 01:18:36.916]  You get the flag, that's right.
[01:18:37.216 --> 01:18:39.558]  Bob, I wanted to correct something that Collar said.
[01:18:39.678 --> 01:18:41.719]  I didn't get threats when I was living in Chicago.
[01:18:41.739 --> 01:18:48.364]  It was after I was already in New Mexico that those threats for criticizing Israel started
[01:18:49.105 --> 01:18:51.588]  Well, you know, you're not supposed to criticize Israel.
[01:18:51.708 --> 01:18:53.810]  It's in the Constitution.
[01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:55.993]  It's the 11th commandment.
[01:18:56.453 --> 01:19:03.021]  It says, thou shalt not criticize Israel because they can do no wrong.
[01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:09.468]  I went after them pretty bad on my show the last few weeks about what they've been doing in Gaza.
[01:19:10.256 --> 01:19:14.279]  You know, I mean, gee whiz, it's like, it's like, am I going to get in trouble for it?
[01:19:14.299 --> 01:19:14.939]  Can I say this?
[01:19:14.999 --> 01:19:15.920]  Can I say this on the air?
[01:19:16.621 --> 01:19:20.984]  Uh, you know, the Holocaust thing was like, you know, never, never, never again.
[01:19:21.024 --> 01:19:26.948]  We've heard that over and over and over again, but the little asterisk was, you know, except we can do it to other people.
[01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:29.258]  You know, just nobody can do it without us.
[01:19:29.358 --> 01:19:31.079]  And that goes back to Obama as well.
[01:19:31.139 --> 01:19:39.565]  I mean, as part of his change, which is not change, is the policy in regard to Israel and what it's doing to the Palestinians has not changed under Obama.
[01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:40.926]  It's exactly the same.
[01:19:41.006 --> 01:19:43.648]  Yeah, and there is no peace process and there never has been one.
[01:19:43.688 --> 01:19:44.088]  That's right.
[01:19:44.869 --> 01:19:49.892]  Okay, we're going to go to a break now and after the break we'll be back with Kurt Nemo and phone calls.
[01:19:49.913 --> 01:19:56.137]  We've got Chris in Mississippi and Gabe in Florida and Ron in Arizona coming up on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.489 --> 01:20:10.709]  Hi, this is Steve Schenk.
[01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:12.150]  eFoods does it again.
[01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:17.171]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:25.633]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:20:26.153 --> 01:20:31.334]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:36.560]  I think so.
[01:20:50.674 --> 01:20:50.994]  I think so.
[01:21:08.388 --> 01:21:10.390]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:12.933]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:21:12.953 --> 01:21:15.516]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:21:15.536 --> 01:21:16.757]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:21:16.777 --> 01:21:18.379]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:21.322]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:21:21.382 --> 01:21:25.026]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:21:34.674 --> 01:21:39.598]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:21:40.799 --> 01:21:41.920]  An inside job.
[01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.672]  How dare you?
[01:21:44.832 --> 01:21:50.816]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:21:50.836 --> 01:21:53.638]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:21:53.738 --> 01:21:59.942]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:22:00.202 --> 01:22:02.784]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:22:03.044 --> 01:22:05.045]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:22:05.305 --> 01:22:07.787]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.204]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:09.284 --> 01:22:14.068]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:22.035]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:22.315 --> 01:22:27.680]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:34.866]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:35.146 --> 01:22:40.469]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:22:40.749 --> 01:22:45.472]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:22:45.832 --> 01:22:53.436]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:22:53.756 --> 01:23:00.000]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.441]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:04.178 --> 01:23:04.998]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:05.018 --> 01:23:12.002]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:23:12.262 --> 01:23:17.164]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:17.364 --> 01:23:18.685]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:23:18.865 --> 01:23:22.347]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:23:22.487 --> 01:23:27.649]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:23:27.889 --> 01:23:33.652]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:23:33.992 --> 01:23:36.414]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:38.816]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:23:39.036 --> 01:23:41.157]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[01:23:41.457 --> 01:23:42.438]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:23:42.658 --> 01:23:43.579]  No animal testing.
[01:23:43.839 --> 01:23:45.160]  I use them and love them.
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.781]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:23:47.061 --> 01:23:48.122]  And I save big time.
[01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:50.063]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:23:50.203 --> 01:23:50.544]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:23:50.564 --> 01:23:52.905]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:03.612]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:05.113]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[01:24:30.923 --> 01:24:33.986]  Yeah, and I did a bad bad thing too.
[01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:35.687]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:24:35.847 --> 01:24:42.992]  We're going to be playing a video at the end of the show so I'm going to be taking some callers real quick to be fair to the callers.
[01:24:43.052 --> 01:24:44.854]  We have Chris up from Mississippi.
[01:24:44.894 --> 01:24:46.054]  Chris, are you there?
[01:24:46.975 --> 01:24:47.756]  Hey, what's going on man?
[01:24:48.256 --> 01:24:48.877]  I'm doing alright.
[01:24:48.897 --> 01:24:49.397]  What's happening?
[01:24:50.278 --> 01:24:51.719]  Oh shoot, nothing much man.
[01:24:52.419 --> 01:24:54.661]  I know Alex is probably listening to the show.
[01:24:54.681 --> 01:24:59.024]  I am a subscriber and appreciate everything he's doing leading the movement.
[01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:09.087]  One thing I wanted to call and ask about is, I don't know if you would have any knowledge or anything like that, but I recently got a letter sent home from my son in school.
[01:25:09.127 --> 01:25:11.008]  He's in the government re-education camps.
[01:25:11.728 --> 01:25:24.453]  Unfortunately, he can't afford to send him to a private school, but he had got a letter saying that they had tested him and he showed pretty high and wanted to give him a formal IQ test and put him in some kind of gifted program.
[01:25:25.054 --> 01:25:26.814]  Now, my question about that was,
[01:25:29.676 --> 01:25:39.220]  Is that more of a, have y'all run across anything saying that that's more of like a fast track toward the, you know, how they're re-educating our children?
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.220]  You know what I'm trying to get at?
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.301]  Well, I don't know specifically.
[01:25:43.361 --> 01:25:46.282]  I do know, I guess it's school district to school district really.
[01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:50.464]  The more local control you have over school district, the better off you're going to be there.
[01:25:50.984 --> 01:25:56.346]  I don't have any problem myself with, you know, smarter kids being able to, you know,
[01:25:56.906 --> 01:25:57.527]  We're good to go.
[01:26:16.908 --> 01:26:20.250]  Plus, if he's really smart, he might be able to figure out if they're trying to con him.
[01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.991]  Thank you for the call.
[01:26:21.011 --> 01:26:21.691]  I appreciate that.
[01:26:22.171 --> 01:26:25.994]  I got Gage in Florida up next.
[01:26:26.154 --> 01:26:26.954]  Gage, are you there?
[01:26:27.935 --> 01:26:28.555]  Yes.
[01:26:29.355 --> 01:26:37.360]  I was looking on Northcom.mil and at the bottom of it, it has Avon Flu.
[01:26:38.381 --> 01:26:44.164]  Now, I'm wondering why in the world would Avon Flu be on Northcom's site?
[01:26:44.688 --> 01:26:49.169]  If it has something to do with the CDC.
[01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:51.489]  Well, it's not just the CDC.
[01:26:51.549 --> 01:26:53.830]  The military is involved in avian flu as well.
[01:26:53.870 --> 01:27:07.332]  I mean, they have contingency plans supposedly to... Northcom has contingency plans for, you know, national emergencies related to natural disaster and outbreaks of contagious diseases.
[01:27:07.872 --> 01:27:09.112]  So that's probably why it's there.
[01:27:10.112 --> 01:27:13.373]  Because what I'm wondering is, I mean, it may sound conspiracy theory, but
[01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:20.632]  You know, with all this weird stuff that's going on now with, you know, camps rising up, you know, from FEMA.
[01:27:21.412 --> 01:27:32.574]  You know, I'm wondering if this whole emergency camp thing is, you know, going to be something like Avon Flu, where they're going to say, oh, everyone's got Avon Flu, they need to go to the camps.
[01:27:33.535 --> 01:27:33.835]  You know?
[01:27:34.055 --> 01:27:34.575]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:27:35.615 --> 01:27:41.977]  Well, there could be some sort of a contrived thing, but I don't deal in what I don't know, and I don't know.
[01:27:41.997 --> 01:27:44.718]  I mean, you put it in the category, I wouldn't put it past him, Kurt.
[01:27:44.898 --> 01:27:46.078]  No, I wouldn't put it past him either.
[01:27:46.818 --> 01:27:48.859]  They have any number of contingency plans, I think.
[01:27:49.299 --> 01:27:51.300]  Okay, Gage in Florida, thank you very much for the call.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.660]  We're trying to move quickly through here.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.421]  I got Ron in Arizona up next.
[01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:55.801]  Ron?
[01:27:57.182 --> 01:27:58.282]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:27:59.362 --> 01:28:01.043]  According to the Bible,
[01:28:02.014 --> 01:28:11.176]  Just before the Lord Jesus Christ returns, it says there's going to be a world government, a world church, and a world economy.
[01:28:11.196 --> 01:28:21.239]  And if we're living in the last days, we should be seeing signs of that, just as Alex Jones, yourself, and others are talking about.
[01:28:21.999 --> 01:28:29.341]  The problem I have is, if this is all true, why aren't the pastors
[01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:33.350]  Talking about the move to create a new world order.
[01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:39.735]  I've been in church for over 50 years and I've only heard one pastor from the pulpit ever talk about it.
[01:28:40.135 --> 01:28:46.139]  And I've only heard a few on the radio and TV talking about it.
[01:28:46.579 --> 01:28:48.741]  Well, I'll try to answer that question, Ron.
[01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:49.541]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:50.082 --> 01:28:54.525]  I'm guessing it's just because we haven't reached enough of them yet and they've been propagandized too much.
[01:28:55.045 --> 01:28:56.426]  We just need to work on the pastors.
[01:28:56.466 --> 01:28:57.027]  That's the deal.
[01:28:57.087 --> 01:28:58.828]  Because the other side is definitely working on them.
[01:28:59.477 --> 01:29:01.599]  Tell you what, we're not going to take any more phone calls.
[01:29:01.759 --> 01:29:03.780]  I'm going to introduce something in the next segment.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:11.266]  We've got a video of Alex Jones with a hip-hop artist by the name of KRS-One.
[01:29:11.286 --> 01:29:23.895]  They did a little video and for the next, coming out of the break, we're going to play this video that Alex shot with KRS-One who is a hip-hop artist.
[01:29:23.935 --> 01:29:24.776]  He's not a rapper.
[01:29:25.056 --> 01:29:27.037]  I guess there's some intersection there.
[01:29:27.057 --> 01:29:27.678]  I really don't know.
[01:29:28.699 --> 01:29:31.281]  And if we have any time at the very end of the show, we'll say goodbye.
[01:29:31.341 --> 01:29:36.646]  But for right now, Kurt Nemo, thanks for hanging in with us in this hour.
[01:29:37.026 --> 01:29:39.188]  And I may be back at the very end of the show to say goodbye.
[01:29:39.348 --> 01:29:42.210]  But this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:29:42.971 --> 01:29:45.453]  And Alex, I'm sure, will be back on Monday.
[01:29:58.695 --> 01:30:01.679]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.433 --> 01:30:14.098]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:30:14.279 --> 01:30:19.443]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:30:19.704 --> 01:30:24.788]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:30:25.089 --> 01:30:28.652]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:30:29.452 --> 01:30:36.976]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:30:37.196 --> 01:30:40.738]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:30:40.998 --> 01:30:45.540]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.601]  Do your part!
[01:30:46.861 --> 01:30:49.122]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:30:49.482 --> 01:30:55.605]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:30:56.045 --> 01:31:00.770]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:02.071]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.378]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:18.879 --> 01:31:19.399]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:20.659]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:20.679 --> 01:31:22.040]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.700]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:30.803]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:31.183 --> 01:31:31.643]  Some U.S.
[01:31:31.683 --> 01:31:37.305]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:41.506]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:41.526 --> 01:31:44.326]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:17.590]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.

[01:33:02.741 --> 01:33:11.804]  Your camera's gonna be playing for our children.
[01:33:13.124 --> 01:33:15.405]  I want our children to see this now.
[01:33:16.145 --> 01:33:19.087]  Because the President just got in like, wow!
[01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:22.488]  But in four years, will we still like him?
[01:33:23.308 --> 01:33:25.709]  In eight years, are we gonna still hype him?
[01:33:26.764 --> 01:33:33.389]  What if you said we're not going to Iran and kill a million people, would you still be down with the man?
[01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:35.431]  Uh-huh!
[01:33:36.171 --> 01:33:40.415]  You better wake up and smell the coffee!
[01:33:41.736 --> 01:33:44.478]  That's why the radio station don't toss me.
[01:33:44.858 --> 01:33:52.424]  Me, when I'm on the microphone, I stand with people like Alex Jones.
[01:33:53.885 --> 01:33:55.907]  That's the true anti-whip.
[01:33:58.616 --> 01:34:01.118]  I've never been about no f***ing government.
[01:34:02.719 --> 01:34:03.940]  I do for myself.
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:05.501]  Speak for myself.
[01:34:05.902 --> 01:34:06.982]  Teach myself.
[01:34:07.363 --> 01:34:08.664]  Reach for myself.
[01:34:10.165 --> 01:34:12.787]  Hip-Hop, you gotta do the same thing.
[01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:16.329]  Listen to me now, while I rap and sing.
[01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:20.432]  The new world order, just put on a black face.
[01:34:23.174 --> 01:34:26.357]  Americans, you are in the process
[01:34:27.546 --> 01:34:28.667]  Globalization.
[01:34:29.627 --> 01:34:31.909]  We are in the process of a new world order.
[01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:36.432]  Just because it has a black face don't mean a thing.
[01:34:38.654 --> 01:34:41.195]  Real politics is about the people.
[01:34:42.236 --> 01:34:42.936]  The people.
[01:34:43.777 --> 01:34:45.258]  The people.
[01:34:45.378 --> 01:34:48.860]  Study the Declaration of Independence.
[01:34:49.121 --> 01:34:50.161]  That's poetry.
[01:34:51.702 --> 01:34:53.864]  Like the United States Constitution.
[01:34:54.284 --> 01:34:54.844]  That's law.
[01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:01.313]  Yep, this is in my own words.
[01:35:01.353 --> 01:35:03.554]  The only words I got.
[01:35:03.574 --> 01:35:09.638]  First of all, the conversation we was having the other day was brilliant.
[01:35:25.505 --> 01:35:31.109]  Um, I think it was very respectful of the fact of what America's feeling right now.
[01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:38.835]  What is most important is that we don't get caught up in emotional politics.
[01:35:39.996 --> 01:35:44.659]  As a black man in the United States, I can feel the emotion.
[01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:51.404]  I can feel the emotion of having a black first family.
[01:35:53.306 --> 01:35:54.027]  In office.
[01:35:55.427 --> 01:36:10.677]  Like, for instance, Barack Obama, when we say, a black person in office, we gotta ease back because for the first time we really have an African American actually in office.
[01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:14.280]  To call him black is a disrespect to his mother.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.041]  And I don't think that's fair.
[01:36:16.561 --> 01:36:19.743]  He comes from a biracial family and that should be respected.
[01:36:20.724 --> 01:36:21.925]  I, more than anybody,
[01:36:23.032 --> 01:36:29.836]  I am ecstatic over the fact that at least the racial barrier in the White House has been broken.
[01:36:30.756 --> 01:36:32.857]  But now let's get down with the truth.
[01:36:33.998 --> 01:36:34.658]  The truth!
[01:36:35.659 --> 01:36:42.103]  After we leave the emotionalism alone for a minute, what are we as Americans should be looking out for?
[01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:46.885]  How should we be getting prepared for what's about to come?
[01:36:48.626 --> 01:36:51.668]  Just because we have an African American president
[01:36:52.472 --> 01:36:57.376]  Does it mean that he's not going to continue the Bush agenda?
[01:36:58.897 --> 01:37:02.980]  I'm not dissing anybody, but a politician is a politician.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.203]  And if I could say one thing to all people in the United States, it's this.
[01:37:10.144 --> 01:37:15.307]  America has broken its own rules, has broken its own laws.
[01:37:16.068 --> 01:37:22.292]  It's time for the citizenry of the United States to actually follow its own laws.
[01:37:23.293 --> 01:37:27.296]  If we stay steadfast to the Constitution, at least
[01:37:29.588 --> 01:37:33.810]  We won't be hit so hard with that global agenda.
[01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:36.651]  Here's what we were talking about the other day.
[01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:46.935]  If you really want to see what black governance is like, take a look at the mayors of major cities.
[01:37:48.223 --> 01:37:51.665]  When the cities were in power, we couldn't be the mayors.
[01:37:52.185 --> 01:37:55.928]  It's when the cities lost power, they put in black mayors.
[01:37:56.488 --> 01:38:00.290]  When the states had power, we couldn't be governors.
[01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:07.134]  But then when the states lose power, we got senators, governors, African American senators and governors.
[01:38:08.075 --> 01:38:10.837]  Now the nation has lost power.
[01:38:11.217 --> 01:38:13.718]  The dollar has lost power.
[01:38:14.079 --> 01:38:15.900]  The world is global.
[01:38:17.003 --> 01:38:20.865]  Now you can get a black president because it doesn't matter.
[01:38:21.565 --> 01:38:22.666]  It's global now.
[01:38:23.506 --> 01:38:25.187]  So the real issue is this.
[01:38:25.967 --> 01:38:35.232]  Are you going to allow this system to tempt you into their prisons, into their job, into their psyche?
[01:38:36.132 --> 01:38:37.333]  Follow your purpose.
[01:38:38.133 --> 01:38:39.994]  This is what will defeat it all.
[01:38:40.735 --> 01:38:45.197]  If you're on your purpose, even death respects purpose.
[01:38:46.394 --> 01:38:47.454]  That's why I'm here.
[01:38:48.274 --> 01:38:49.875]  Because I'm on my purpose.
[01:38:50.455 --> 01:38:52.175]  You don't think they hear me every day?
[01:38:53.356 --> 01:38:55.736]  You don't think they hear Alex Jones every day?
[01:38:56.416 --> 01:38:57.577]  You don't think they just heard?
[01:38:57.597 --> 01:39:00.037]  You don't think the FBI was out there right now?
[01:39:01.498 --> 01:39:02.398]  But you know what?
[01:39:03.478 --> 01:39:07.659]  They can't do nothing to a person who stands with the truth.
[01:39:08.479 --> 01:39:10.080]  Because I forgot who said it.
[01:39:13.941 --> 01:39:14.741]  But I'll quote it.
[01:39:16.049 --> 01:39:24.453]  There's a saying that says, what a disadvantage it is to only be able to die for your country one time.
[01:39:28.075 --> 01:39:29.416]  The concept is this.
[01:39:30.512 --> 01:39:31.793]  Don't get caught up.
[01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:33.774]  I said it on stage.
[01:39:34.374 --> 01:39:38.717]  They put a black face on the New World Order and now we all happy.
[01:39:39.497 --> 01:39:40.758]  KRS ain't buying it.
[01:39:41.098 --> 01:39:42.158]  I never been a voter.
[01:39:42.278 --> 01:39:43.119]  This year I voted.
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:45.540]  Why did I vote?
[01:39:46.181 --> 01:39:48.502]  Because I want to be able to critique.
[01:39:49.542 --> 01:39:50.403]  That's why I voted.
[01:39:51.607 --> 01:39:56.510]  I didn't vote for Bush, I didn't vote for my... Plus he had to repudiate Bush, that's why... No!
[01:39:57.351 --> 01:40:01.774]  Even if I voted for Bush, he still was going to be, if I didn't vote or did vote, he still was going to be the president.
[01:40:02.294 --> 01:40:04.556]  And this is the point, this is the point!
[01:40:05.397 --> 01:40:12.362]  If they controlled it before, what are you, why don't, what makes you think they're not controlling it now?
[01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:16.164]  The country was on a verge of revolution!
[01:40:17.085 --> 01:40:20.127]  They threw a black man up, now we like this.
[01:40:25.816 --> 01:40:26.717]  Don't get caught up.
[01:40:27.417 --> 01:40:28.918]  Now I say this respectfully.
[01:40:29.499 --> 01:40:31.960]  Because Barack Obama, I don't know the man.
[01:40:32.961 --> 01:40:34.182]  I don't know his agenda.
[01:40:34.722 --> 01:40:35.643]  But I know mine.
[01:40:36.544 --> 01:40:39.126]  Let's see if our agendas match.
[01:40:39.706 --> 01:40:41.107]  I stand with Dr. King.
[01:40:41.587 --> 01:40:45.270]  I stand with Malcolm X. I stand with the Black Panther Party.
[01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:48.312]  I don't know if my president can stand with that.
[01:40:48.913 --> 01:40:54.417]  But if my president frees Mumia Abu-Jamal, maybe he'll get my eye up.
[01:40:55.097 --> 01:41:00.121]  If my president could release political prisoners, maybe my eye will go up.
[01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:08.227]  If my president can stop ignoring police misconduct, maybe my eye will go up.
[01:41:08.947 --> 01:41:10.088]  But I'm not hopeful.
[01:41:10.469 --> 01:41:18.454]  And let me say this, nature has a way of perfecting itself.
[01:41:22.492 --> 01:41:28.455]  This time, if they try to assassinate the President, I don't think it'll work.
[01:41:29.175 --> 01:41:34.737]  In fact, it may happen, but the ones who do it will finally be exposed.
[01:41:35.498 --> 01:41:42.521]  The concept is this, if Barack is true to the people, there will be some opposition.
[01:41:44.542 --> 01:41:51.625]  If there is opposition, we the people are the ones who are going to have to fight, not him.
[01:41:53.703 --> 01:41:59.247]  The real issue is, we used to say, which side are you on?
[01:41:59.707 --> 01:42:01.769]  Which side are you on?
[01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:04.571]  I'm not on the emotional side.
[01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:08.153]  I'm not on this black side, white side.
[01:42:08.194 --> 01:42:09.434]  I don't know what that is.
[01:42:10.055 --> 01:42:13.257]  I got black police officers shooting at me every day.
[01:42:13.898 --> 01:42:17.060]  I got black senators that want to keep me in poverty.
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.021]  I don't know what that is.
[01:42:19.602 --> 01:42:20.923]  But I know what the truth is.
[01:42:21.443 --> 01:42:23.285]  The truth come out of anybody's mouth.
[01:42:23.625 --> 01:42:25.387]  The truth don't have no color.
[01:42:25.947 --> 01:42:27.849]  The truth is that people are hurting.
[01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:31.412]  The truth is that they trying to turn us into China.
[01:42:32.153 --> 01:42:39.040]  The truth is we're in so much debt that the only way out is revolution or war.
[01:42:40.316 --> 01:42:44.299]  So now the question is, what side are you on?
[01:42:44.619 --> 01:42:56.587]  Everyone is pointing to Barack right now, President Obama, as saying, you gotta get the economy together, you gotta get the economy together, when in fact the President has very little to do with the economy.
[01:42:57.147 --> 01:43:02.451]  It's the Federal Reserve Chairman that at least sets the policy
[01:43:03.251 --> 01:43:13.940]  The President can appoint, or the President does appoint the Federal Reserve Chairman, but after that, that's a privately owned company, the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.121]  They set the agenda.
[01:43:17.102 --> 01:43:24.408]  What you said earlier about if their plans fail, they get to blame it on Barack.
[01:43:25.269 --> 01:43:28.131]  Barack is like the manager of Burger King.
[01:43:29.752 --> 01:43:31.614]  All Presidents, including Bush,
[01:43:33.502 --> 01:43:47.995]  It's like this, when your fries are cold, if your burger's not done right, you go back to Burger King America, or your government, and you say, my burger's cold, I want new fries.
[01:43:48.795 --> 01:43:50.237]  The manager comes out.
[01:43:50.837 --> 01:43:54.661]  Or first, you go to the cashier, that's the courts.
[01:43:56.242 --> 01:43:57.903]  You argue to the courts.
[01:43:58.905 --> 01:44:03.947]  The courts, if you can't get no justice with the cashier, you say, let me see the manager.
[01:44:04.627 --> 01:44:06.148]  I want to go to the Supreme Court.
[01:44:06.608 --> 01:44:08.108]  I want to see the president.
[01:44:09.329 --> 01:44:10.529]  The manager comes out.
[01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:13.370]  Hi, what can I do for you?
[01:44:13.911 --> 01:44:17.152]  Now the manager can override the decisions of the cashier.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.344]  But you never get to see the franchise owner of Burger King.
[01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:35.012]  If you really have a problem with your burger, you need to go see the franchise owner and tell them the actual make of the burger coming out the factory is wrong.
[01:44:35.492 --> 01:44:40.136]  What you're sending to all these little operations is wrong.
[01:44:40.516 --> 01:44:41.937]  We need to go to the top.
[01:44:42.738 --> 01:44:43.638]  Or to the bottom.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.961]  We need to go
[01:44:47.918 --> 01:44:51.339]  To where the real architecture of government is.
[01:44:51.839 --> 01:44:54.019]  And it's not in a precedent.
[01:44:54.619 --> 01:45:00.921]  It's in a global scheme to make the 99% work for the 1%.
[01:45:02.661 --> 01:45:09.783]  And the 99% are going along with it because they're tempting you with everything you want.
[01:45:12.651 --> 01:45:14.031]  A rapper named T.I.
[01:45:14.511 --> 01:45:15.112]  put a record out.
[01:45:15.152 --> 01:45:19.633]  He said, you can have whatever you like.
[01:45:20.233 --> 01:45:21.813]  Americans love that.
[01:45:22.333 --> 01:45:24.094]  You can have whatever you like.
[01:45:25.234 --> 01:45:26.214]  That's the trick.
[01:45:27.075 --> 01:45:28.575]  Learn to live simple.
[01:45:28.875 --> 01:45:29.655]  They hate it.
[01:45:30.595 --> 01:45:32.536]  Learn to say, I'm good.
[01:45:32.836 --> 01:45:33.636]  You can keep it.
[01:45:34.336 --> 01:45:35.077]  They hate it.
[01:45:35.917 --> 01:45:37.117]  Walk with God.
[01:45:37.637 --> 01:45:38.737]  Walk with law.
[01:45:39.078 --> 01:45:40.658]  And never give up your gun.
[01:45:41.997 --> 01:45:47.258]  Don't be tempted and leave the emotionalism out of politics.
[01:45:47.858 --> 01:45:49.239]  You know when you should get emotional?
[01:45:49.599 --> 01:45:51.299]  When injustice happens.
[01:45:51.939 --> 01:45:54.060]  That's when your emotions should rise up.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.961]  You saw what happened the other day at that BART station in Oakland.
[01:45:58.301 --> 01:46:01.321]  Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.
[01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:02.962]  Dr. Martin Luther King.
[01:46:03.762 --> 01:46:06.822]  For me, I feel the pain of suffering people.
[01:46:07.223 --> 01:46:07.743]  I don't know.
[01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:09.063]  It's just in me.
[01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:28.213]  I don't want to be like the German in Nazi Germany, watching people go off in droves, and because you have a comfortable house, because you got a Mercedes Benz and you're eating every day, it don't matter!
[01:46:28.633 --> 01:46:29.934]  Oh, just go on!
[01:46:30.474 --> 01:46:32.774]  When I was very little, I couldn't take it.
[01:46:34.615 --> 01:46:36.675]  My mother used to tell me about slavery.
[01:46:38.117 --> 01:46:41.059]  And for a long time I thought I had a slave history.
[01:46:43.941 --> 01:46:52.387]  I used to think I came from slavery until I realized that all of America is an immigrant country.
[01:46:52.928 --> 01:46:57.671]  We are constantly being refreshed with new people, constantly.
[01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:05.977]  Slavery, I'll put it this way, the only way slavery could have existed in this country for so long, over 300 years,
[01:47:07.828 --> 01:47:11.552]  Is it because people went along with it?
[01:47:12.973 --> 01:47:18.979]  The law cannot work unless the citizens go along with it, good or bad.
[01:47:20.441 --> 01:47:22.063]  If the citizens stop...
[01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:26.373]  Stop adhering to their own good laws.
[01:47:27.113 --> 01:47:28.275]  They're unprotected.
[01:47:29.416 --> 01:47:37.783]  If the citizens stomp out or stop aligning themselves with bad laws, the laws go away.
[01:47:38.004 --> 01:47:39.365]  Liberty is not granted.
[01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:40.666]  It's taken.
[01:47:41.527 --> 01:47:42.108]  Freedom!
[01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:45.090]  Liberty is when you're on the ships.
[01:47:45.110 --> 01:47:46.932]  They let you have liberty.
[01:48:13.427 --> 01:48:16.050]  Can we shout out Jordan Maxwell real quick?
[01:48:18.473 --> 01:48:23.439]  We need to become free people again, not freed people.
[01:48:25.261 --> 01:48:25.982]  I'll say it again.
[01:48:27.784 --> 01:48:32.109]  We need to be free people, not freed people.
[01:48:33.482 --> 01:48:40.007]  Just because we have an emancipation procrastination does not mean that we are actually free.
[01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:45.351]  What makes you free is your declaration within that you are free.
[01:48:46.752 --> 01:48:51.116]  If somebody else can give you freedom, they can also take it away.
[01:48:52.867 --> 01:48:57.628]  When a lot of people were not free in the United States, Harriet Tubman was free.
[01:48:59.689 --> 01:49:01.409]  Frederick Douglass was free.
[01:49:01.989 --> 01:49:03.410]  Nat Turner was free.
[01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:08.551]  So the point of the matter is this, are you free or have you been freed?
[01:49:09.411 --> 01:49:10.891]  Power looks for weakness.
[01:49:14.392 --> 01:49:16.713]  Power looks for weakness.
[01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:27.716]  If you stand in firm and you say, I know the law, not just this law of the land or sea, but I know THE law.
[01:49:28.136 --> 01:49:31.861]  I know that justice, I know that nature is just.
[01:49:33.303 --> 01:49:34.785]  And if you're unnatural,
[01:49:36.019 --> 01:49:36.940]  Out of nature!
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:39.122]  Imbalanced yourself!
[01:49:39.742 --> 01:49:43.485]  The real war is not me against you, it's endurance!
[01:49:44.626 --> 01:49:46.427]  I'm going to out-endure you!
[01:49:48.329 --> 01:49:52.993]  The evil people trip themselves up trying to chase the righteous!
[01:49:53.833 --> 01:49:59.618]  It's when the righteous come out of their square and into their world and try to fight.
[01:50:00.098 --> 01:50:01.179]  Say no, just resist!
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.362]  Matter of fact, don't even recognize their authority!
[01:50:06.084 --> 01:50:08.405]  When you recognize their authority, it got you.
[01:50:08.986 --> 01:50:10.787]  They've been doing it to us for ages.
[01:50:12.388 --> 01:50:17.892]  You say whatever you like about black people being over-represented in prison.
[01:50:18.752 --> 01:50:20.814]  You know I ain't with that at all.
[01:50:21.954 --> 01:50:26.557]  But the truth is, my own people are lost.
[01:50:27.518 --> 01:50:31.921]  I said the other day, Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.
[01:50:32.701 --> 01:50:35.243]  I just came here as Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.
[01:50:36.795 --> 01:50:51.520]  In Harlem, where every city has a Dr. King Boulevard, if you go to the edges of those cities or even along the whole of the boulevard, what are black people doing on Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard?
[01:50:53.581 --> 01:50:59.623]  We're selling drugs illegally, killing ourselves on Dr. King Boulevard.
[01:51:08.772 --> 01:51:13.556]  Lead a superior life by drinking Superior Life brand ionized water.
[01:51:13.876 --> 01:51:17.839]  A couple of soft drinks each day, a few slices of pizza, last night's cheeseburgers.
[01:51:18.159 --> 01:51:23.964]  These acidic foods will make you tired, overweight, and cause numerous negative health problems in the short and long term.
[01:51:24.404 --> 01:51:30.649]  An acidic environment is created in the body, causing fuzzy memory and that all-day low energy feeling.
[01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:34.833]  These are the early signs of your body telling you that it's not getting the proper care it needs.
[01:51:35.113 --> 01:51:36.995]  We are truly a junk food nation.
[01:51:37.415 --> 01:51:45.942]  Drinking ionized water will help you drop the weight, feel better, actually become hydrated, and can improve the quality of your life.
[01:51:46.243 --> 01:51:47.684]  It's all about the pH.
[01:51:48.164 --> 01:51:50.345]  Disease cannot thrive in an alkaline body.
[01:51:50.646 --> 01:51:52.987]  What can a Life Brand Water Ionizer do for you?
[01:51:53.447 --> 01:51:54.208]  Call 800-276-9601.
[01:51:54.448 --> 01:51:59.491]  That's 800-276-9601.
[01:52:00.351 --> 01:52:03.994]  Or visit us at SuperiorLifeWater.com.

[01:52:06.855 --> 01:52:07.996]  What's in your water?
[01:52:08.396 --> 01:52:10.077]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:52:10.358 --> 01:52:13.820]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:15.781]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:52:16.422 --> 01:52:19.152]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:52:19.473 --> 01:52:20.216]  It is essential that...
[01:52:21.778 --> 01:52:22.198]  Let's do it!
[01:52:46.733 --> 01:52:50.715]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[01:52:50.875 --> 01:52:55.396]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:52:55.716 --> 01:52:58.197]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[01:53:00.618 --> 01:53:02.399]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[01:53:02.599 --> 01:53:04.400]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.140]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:07.261]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:12.274]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[01:53:12.675 --> 01:53:17.420]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:22.726]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[01:53:23.026 --> 01:53:24.988]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[01:53:25.249 --> 01:53:29.894]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEFs, and other retirement plans
[01:53:30.174 --> 01:53:30.675]  I don't know.
[01:53:56.138 --> 01:54:00.201]  Well, there's a movie called Black Panther, the Black Panther movie, where it has become American entertainment.
[01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:30.928]  To show how the government put heroin in the black community to offset revolutionary organizations.
[01:54:31.368 --> 01:54:33.449]  This is American entertainment!
[01:54:34.029 --> 01:54:37.490]  Like, you could go to the movies, sit down, and be entertained by this.
[01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:40.530]  I find it amazing.
[01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:42.891]  History repeats itself.
[01:54:43.631 --> 01:54:47.072]  And every time it does, it goes up a little bit.
[01:54:50.236 --> 01:54:51.497]  We are back again!
[01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:54.861]  We're the abolitionists, again!
[01:54:55.721 --> 01:55:00.947]  And this, right here, this gathering right here, is the true state of America.
[01:55:01.267 --> 01:55:03.629]  The true state of American history.
[01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:08.334]  We Africans in America, we were trying to get free.
[01:55:08.854 --> 01:55:12.698]  We couldn't get free on our own because our own people were betraying us.
[01:55:13.619 --> 01:55:25.806]  It was strong white American families that ran the Underground Railroad, that would leave a lantern in the window, and we would run up, knock two or three times, and be let in.
[01:55:26.246 --> 01:55:32.110]  A lot of families were hung because of that, shot because of that.
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:40.235]  Yeah, we talk about Harriet Tubman, but the families, the white American families that risked their lives taking her in,
[01:55:41.115 --> 01:55:44.236]  That's the part of American history we need to hear again!
[01:55:44.696 --> 01:55:45.796]  Our main message?
[01:55:46.356 --> 01:55:47.597]  Stop the violence!
[01:55:48.517 --> 01:55:50.057]  They want us to be violent!
[01:55:50.557 --> 01:55:52.258]  They want us to be enraged!
[01:55:52.898 --> 01:55:53.598]  Angered!
[01:55:54.598 --> 01:55:57.499]  Peace is a revolutionary strategy!
[01:55:58.459 --> 01:56:00.260]  If you could just hold your peace!
[01:56:01.653 --> 01:56:06.476]  This is the center of endurance, and endurance is what wins wars.
[01:56:07.056 --> 01:56:10.898]  Not how many people you kill, but how long can you endure.
[01:56:11.059 --> 01:56:17.022]  George Washington lost almost every battle he had, but he endured!
[01:56:17.502 --> 01:56:21.665]  He out-endured the British, and that's how the battle was won.
[01:56:22.125 --> 01:56:22.946]  Endurance!
[01:56:23.746 --> 01:56:26.348]  So I'm saying, stop the violence!
[01:56:26.908 --> 01:56:28.409]  Stop the violence in your home!
[01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:30.651]  Stop the violence in yourself!
[01:56:31.111 --> 01:56:32.972]  Meaning, doubting yourself!
[01:56:33.593 --> 01:56:34.653]  Hating yourself!
[01:56:35.694 --> 01:56:37.635]  Stop the violence in society!
[01:56:38.336 --> 01:56:40.877]  Police officers, I beg you!
[01:56:41.558 --> 01:56:43.339]  Stop the violence!
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.142]  I interrupted you earlier and you were trying to tell a Bart story.
[01:56:48.162 --> 01:56:51.244]  You started the Bart story and I interrupted you.
[01:56:51.624 --> 01:56:52.525]  The Bart story?
[01:56:54.508 --> 01:57:00.593]  I was going to say that violence in society is not caused by the people.
[01:57:01.473 --> 01:57:03.855]  It's caused by the neglect of leadership.
[01:57:05.056 --> 01:57:10.440]  And the police are the number one cause of violence in society.
[01:57:11.081 --> 01:57:12.922]  They make the people jittery.
[01:57:13.323 --> 01:57:15.284]  They make the people insecure.
[01:57:15.744 --> 01:57:22.390]  Plus, if you look up what a police officer is in the Blacks Law Dictionary,
[01:57:23.237 --> 01:57:26.742]  The only thing the police is supposed to be doing is keeping the peace.
[01:57:28.745 --> 01:57:29.687]  And they do not!
[01:57:30.027 --> 01:57:30.508]  So who...
[01:57:31.584 --> 01:57:41.993]  Whose fault is it when you have violence in society if you're paying taxes to have peace in society and moral justice?
[01:57:42.693 --> 01:57:47.157]  The police are supposed to be the epitome of morality.
[01:57:47.878 --> 01:57:54.984]  Our children are supposed to look at a police officer and see an example of what a citizen is.
[01:57:56.582 --> 01:57:57.484]  Now they fear him.
[01:57:57.785 --> 01:58:03.135]  So if our children don't even respect the police, how they gonna respect the law?
[01:58:04.853 --> 01:58:11.878]  All right, that was KRS-One here, interviewed by Alex Jones recently right here in Austin, right near Martin Luther King Boulevard.
[01:58:12.478 --> 01:58:14.759]  That guy knows some stuff, you know that?
[01:58:14.819 --> 01:58:17.461]  That guy, he understands the big picture.
[01:58:17.961 --> 01:58:20.483]  Hey, listen, we're just about out of time on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:20.523 --> 01:58:23.645]  This is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones.
[01:58:23.745 --> 01:58:29.048]  If you want to go to my website, it's simpletruthonline.net, simpletruthonline.net.
[01:58:30.296 --> 01:58:35.379]  That's where they archive our local TV show here in Austin, The Simple Truth, produced by Jeff Kemptoff and Kelly Taylor.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:43.845]  So, I'm sure Alex will be back Monday, full of good and vigor, and until then, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:58:44.345 --> 01:58:49.268]  Take care and have a good weekend.
[01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:51.730]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:55.772]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:59.931]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:00.051 --> 01:59:04.613]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:04.793 --> 01:59:07.554]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:07.754 --> 01:59:10.615]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:10.795 --> 01:59:15.517]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:15.757 --> 01:59:16.697]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:16.877 --> 01:59:19.819]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:27.002]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:27.102 --> 01:59:30.243]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:30.383 --> 01:59:30.643]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:32.984 --> 01:59:33.504]  We're good to go.
