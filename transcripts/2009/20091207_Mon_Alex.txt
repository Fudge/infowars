[00:00:02.296 --> 00:00:08.322]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:11.905]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:20.425]  We are simulcasting the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:28.969]  Every day the radio show converts at the halfway point, sometimes earlier, to television via PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.771]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:39.176]  I have the webmaster and the head of an excellent website, Cryptome.org, John Young, joining us next hour.
[00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:44.720]  I meant to get into this subject later in the show, how Google, Yahoo, they all surveil you.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.522]  It all goes instantly to the government.
[00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.083]  There are no warrants.
[00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:49.964]  It's all completely illegal.
[00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:59.371]  I pulled up articles out of USA Today that when you order a pizza, it's run through a criminal database to see if you have a warrant, because they know you're giving your real name and credit card.
[00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:01.512]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:03.033]  Everyone put through these grids.
[00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:06.155]  This is being run by the criminal government.
[00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:11.939]  Goldman Sachs, according to Bloomberg, is arming itself with weapons against the public.
[00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.123]  Northcom and Homeland Security's number one enemy, according to their own documents, is the American people.
[00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:24.325]  Gun owners, veterans, conservatives, this is what you expect from a criminal, rogue government.
[00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.746]  A private, corporate takeover is happening.
[00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:45.072]  This is the first day of the Copenhagen, Denmark, United Nations Climate Change Conference, December 7th and December 18th, as they ratify open world government, in the words of the head of the EU and the UN, Ban Ki-moon and Herman Van Rompuy, and Al Gore and many others.
[00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:47.733]  In fact, I want to cue those clips up again and play those later in the hour.
[00:01:48.499 --> 00:02:01.582]  Now I had meant to just take calls and go over the latest on ClimateGate, this open world government being established, what's in the treaty, whether Obama's going to sign on, he will sign on.
[00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:05.804]  Then they've got to ratify it through the Senate, that probably will pass this year or next.
[00:02:06.184 --> 00:02:14.506]  The problem is, even if it doesn't pass, the states, this is worldwide, all the sub-regions, are already implementing the carbon system.
[00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.154]  The EPA, in line with that, has announced today they are going to list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[00:02:21.554 --> 00:02:37.345]  The average 160-pound homo sapien sapien, human being, that's you and I, puts off five and a half pounds of carbon dioxide a day that plants then respirate from, thus producing oxygen and completing the carbon cycle on the planet.
[00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.406]  Carbon, of course, has been 14 to 20 times higher.
[00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:43.708]  Carbon dioxide in the past, it is a life-giving gas.
[00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:46.069]  The earth is actually carbon dioxide starved.
[00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:52.093]  The globalists chose this as a tax because it allows them to have an iron grip over all industry, all human activity.
[00:02:52.373 --> 00:03:06.341]  In the words of the head UN biodiversity chief, Maurice Strong, to quote, shut down all industrial society and make humankind the enemy of the global government.
[00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:11.123]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this evil.
[00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:24.631]  Now I open the phones up and we've taken more than 10 calls of people all over the country going to gun shows, told give us your driver's license, they scan, give us your social security, some scan it, some just write it down.
[00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:26.857]  Walmart doing it.
[00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:29.920]  The feds have ordered this outside of law.
[00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:31.522]  They're just ordering it.
[00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.424]  It's unified nationwide.
[00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.848]  People are sending in the reports of the names of the gun shows.
[00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:45.617]  I've known this is happening for a year, but I'm so busy on other issues I hadn't really covered it on air, and it took a caller mentioning it that ignited my anger.
[00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:48.145]  This is illegitimate, it's illegal.
[00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:51.346]  I need stories from Kurt Nemo on this ASAP.
[00:03:52.646 --> 00:04:01.088]  Again, we just went live at TV, but if you go to the podcast at Infowars.com and subscribe to it, or the re-streams, or if your local AM and FM re-airs the show, most carry it live.
[00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:09.310]  In that entire second hour, I took call, after call, after call, naming the gun shows where this has happened.
[00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.610]  And I've already confirmed it's going on.
[00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.151]  It's just good to actually hear it from the people.
[00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:18.340]  The government just orders the gun shows to do it.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.400]  No law.
[00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:22.423]  They're just intimidated by the BATF goons to do it.
[00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:24.945]  It is absolutely devastating.
[00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:26.626]  Let's take one more call on that subject.
[00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:30.168]  Then we're going to shut down my phone system and only open on special occasions.
[00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.090]  And go back to the Genesis calls.
[00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.893]  For everybody that's holding, perhaps Genesis can give me a new call list.
[00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:38.795]  Because those calls have been holding for a while.
[00:04:39.938 --> 00:04:43.059]  A fresh call list so I can make sure I'm going to callers that are actually there.
[00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.119]  I appreciate the Genesis phone calls for holding while I went over all that.
[00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:49.840]  But let's get through a bunch of your calls right now.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.940]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim in Utah.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.001]  Jim, what's your story?
[00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:58.401]  Well, my story is in Price, Utah.
[00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:04.022]  I went to Kmart to do some Christmas shopping and filled up a buggy full of merchandise.
[00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:06.763]  Went to buy my son a .22 rifle.
[00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:09.223]  Noticed there was no guns.
[00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:13.509]  So I asked the service person, where was their 22 rifles?
[00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:28.219]  And they told me that the Kmart's have chosen not to sell the American people guns, or ammunition, or archery, or any of that anymore.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.201]  Yeah, that happened with Rosie O'Donnell originally.
[00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:37.325]  She called for them to stop selling guns, and they did a few years after that.
[00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:38.967]  But, uh,
[00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:44.427]  Did you hear all the callers who were having to give drivers license to buy ammo?
[00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:57.731]  Yeah, I went into Walmart and was going to buy ammunition, and they had a clipboard there, and the first question out of their mouth was, is this for a handgun or a rifle?
[00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:04.533]  And I asked them why they needed to know, and they said before they could sell it to me, that's the question they had to ask.
[00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:11.099]  And then, every Walmart in the country takes your driver's license and scans it.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.261]  Did they ask for that?
[00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:15.903]  Uh, you know, it didn't even get to that point.
[00:06:15.963 --> 00:06:19.466]  I told them if I had to do all that, I wasn't going to live like a slave.
[00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:25.690]  And in both cases, I left both buggies of merchandise for them to restock themselves.
[00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:30.334]  So anybody, you know, if they're not going to sell us guns and ammo, I say go somewhere else and shop.
[00:06:30.354 --> 00:06:32.295]  Well, I hear you and God bless you, Jim.
[00:06:32.355 --> 00:06:33.096]  Here's what's happening.
[00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:37.592]  They can't pass the gun laws they want federally, though they're trying.
[00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:44.495]  They've got gun laws where the BATF can recommend to the Attorney General, and he can ban any guns he wants.
[00:06:44.555 --> 00:06:45.856]  It just gives him imperial power.
[00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:47.856]  That bill's got co-sponsors right now.
[00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:49.917]  They've got the no-fly, no-buy.
[00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:52.958]  No judge, no jury, no conviction, no arrest, no indictment.
[00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:54.699]  They won't tell you how you got on the list.
[00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:55.759]  You can't get off the list.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.600]  They just say you can't buy a gun anymore.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.321]  They're already doing that, even though the bill hadn't passed.
[00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:01.862]  That's already been implemented.
[00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:11.657]  But in California and many other states, Texas has already tried this, they make you thumbprint and register to buy ammo every time you buy ammo.
[00:07:11.957 --> 00:07:20.366]  But where they can't get it passed as a law, the BATF comes in, and I've seen them do it, with shaved heads and little mafia mustaches or goatees.
[00:07:20.847 --> 00:07:22.448]  I mean, they look like guys right out of...
[00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:29.072]  If I was casting for a Hollywood movie and wanted criminals, I would go hire BATF because they just look like real criminals.
[00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:31.673]  A vapor of evil comes off of them.
[00:07:32.934 --> 00:07:33.754]  It's unbelievable.
[00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:38.016]  And they come in and they go, looks like you spelled this guy's name wrong.
[00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:46.280]  They'll go through 5,000 forms and find one spot where you didn't dot an I. And they'll say, I got you for fraud with firearms sales.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.881]  This is how they shut down most of the gun shops.
[00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:49.122]  And they'll say, or...
[00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:58.137]  You start getting social security numbers anybody that buys ammo, or buys a cleaning kit, and I won't put you in prison.
[00:07:58.537 --> 00:08:05.140]  You work for me now, punk, and they'll sit there and wet their pants and roll over and America dies by a million cuts.
[00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:07.897]  And this is how they run America.
[00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:13.119]  And they go in those gun shows and they say, one old man sold three rifles in one month here.
[00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.480]  We think that's firearms trafficking.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.901]  Even though they're legally allowed to sell the guns, we're going to say you're allowing trafficking.
[00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:26.283]  We're going to indict this gun show for felonies unless you let us put surveillance cameras in and you get social security numbers from everybody.
[00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:27.423]  Do you understand?
[00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:32.585]  And you know the decadent, weak gun shop owners like, I don't care about the Second Amendment.
[00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:33.605]  I just want money.
[00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:35.446]  Hell, I'll help you put everybody in prison.
[00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:37.547]  Alright, I'll do what you say!
[00:08:37.748 --> 00:08:38.470]  I'll do it right now!
[00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:47.892]  And that's how America dies, and quietly, the secret police are recruiting the kids, and brainwashing them, and having them write dossiers on their parents, nationwide.
[00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:55.237]  And the police are taking blood without warrants on the side of the road, and they're questioning people's kids, and taking them in and doing strip searches whenever they want.
[00:08:55.617 --> 00:08:58.159]  And they're forcibly inoculating kids all over the country.
[00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:01.361]  When the parents get mad, they say, shut up, we're gonna do what we want.
[00:09:01.902 --> 00:09:08.807]  And the government's just practicing criminality, practicing evil, practicing oppression, practicing dominating everyone.
[00:09:10.652 --> 00:09:22.131]  Just like more than half a million women from 1922 to 1987, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, were taken and had their uteruses cut out.
[00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:22.752]  They didn't just...
[00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:25.354]  They didn't just tie their tubes.
[00:09:25.874 --> 00:09:30.816]  They removed the entire uterus, because it had an added soft kill and would debilitate a lot of them.
[00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:31.796]  That added fun.
[00:09:31.816 --> 00:09:37.499]  44% of Native American women were sterilized from 1970 to 1975 alone.
[00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:39.280]  They weren't in any type of health care.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.100]  They weren't told what the procedure was.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.141]  They were just knocked out and sterilized.
[00:09:43.742 --> 00:09:44.982]  That's what this government is.
[00:09:45.282 --> 00:09:46.823]  They're putting drugs in your water.
[00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:48.404]  They're sterilizing you.
[00:09:48.424 --> 00:09:50.365]  They're giving your children bone cancer.
[00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:50.985]  They admit it.
[00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.172]  They brag that you're animals and stupid and that there's nothing you can do to stop them.
[00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:57.732]  They love it.
[00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:01.133]  And these government bureaucrats love giving their kids big glasses of fluoride.
[00:10:01.553 --> 00:10:03.153]  It's a giggling, demonic spirit.
[00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:04.494]  They always laugh about it.
[00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:10.896]  You tell one of these evil servants of tyranny about how they're being hurt by the system, they'll just giggle and give you this little piggy smile is what I call it.
[00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:13.297]  And it's just a spirit of submission to evil.
[00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:17.538]  As long as they can hurt people under them, they don't mind if they're getting hurt from those on top.
[00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:19.559]  It's all about just cowardice.
[00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:24.162]  A lot of people are scared of evil and scared of darkness and scared of the power of evil.
[00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:27.965]  And so at a subconscious level they decide to join it and serve it.
[00:10:28.345 --> 00:10:29.906]  And that's why we're an evil people.
[00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:38.892]  We wear skulls and death and murder and the trappings and the symbols of our nation are all the colors and symbols of the Nazis and the Soviets.
[00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.094]  And death and destruction is what we love.
[00:10:42.494 --> 00:10:45.256]  And because we're just being bathed and prepared for the feast.
[00:10:45.556 --> 00:10:47.538]  We're being washed and scrubbed and
[00:10:48.238 --> 00:10:52.761]  Brought out on a silver pallet to the devils, to literally tear us to pieces.
[00:10:53.021 --> 00:11:00.846]  And the globals will do what they did in the Soviet Union, and in Maoist China and Nazi Germany, they're just gonna murder and kill and slaughter and torture children.
[00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:06.250]  And the whole grid is in place, and they're just, yes, our great time of murder is almost here!
[00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.051]  We've always hated America!
[00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:09.992]  We've got secret police in place!
[00:11:10.212 --> 00:11:11.553]  They're ready to wage war!
[00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.894]  The public's lost their spirit to stand up!
[00:11:14.415 --> 00:11:16.056]  Soon the murder will begin!
[00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:21.619]  It's not enough that we CPS and kill the kids in many cases and test radiation on foster children.
[00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:28.323]  It's not enough that we radiate and spray nerve gas on the troops and Project Shed and kill thousands and maim thousands.
[00:11:28.683 --> 00:11:34.186]  It's not enough that we put HIV in the Factor VIII drug product to give over a million people HIV.
[00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.808]  It's not enough we put hundreds of chemicals in the water.
[00:11:37.108 --> 00:11:41.251]  It's not enough that 20% of the population's on Prozac, literally eating holes in their brains.
[00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:45.814]  It's not enough we're feeding them GMO that sterilizes all the rodents when they test it on them.
[00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:46.875]  It doesn't matter!
[00:11:47.055 --> 00:11:48.356]  That's all just the setup!
[00:11:48.536 --> 00:11:50.097]  This country's ready to be raped!
[00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:51.558]  It's ready to be slaughtered!
[00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:53.420]  Our power is about to be released!
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.583]  God, please, Satan, release us to kill the American people!
[00:11:57.743 --> 00:11:59.764]  They are ready for us to drink their blood!

[00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:23.520]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.300]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.741]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:33.342]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:35.403]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:13:35.643 --> 00:13:37.043]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:13:37.403 --> 00:13:39.663]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:44.284]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:48.025]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:50.446]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:52.886]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:13:53.386 --> 00:13:54.026]  One last time.
[00:13:54.407 --> 00:13:55.987]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:01.168]  Good day.
[00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:02.868]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:03.388]  December 7, 2009.
[00:14:03.448 --> 00:14:04.348]  Gold opened this morning at $1144.70.
[00:14:04.388 --> 00:14:07.749]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1175.75, $587.88 for a half-ounce, or $293.94 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:08.349]  That's $1175.75, $587.88, and $293.94.
[00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:33.964]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:42.633]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:43.833]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:14:43.973 --> 00:14:48.114]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:14:48.334 --> 00:14:50.055]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:54.116]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:14:54.236 --> 00:14:55.056]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:59.897]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:00.837]  Hello.
[00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:05.578]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:09.019]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature
[00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:20.414]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:15:20.455 --> 00:15:24.597]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:15:24.697 --> 00:15:28.859]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:15:29.039 --> 00:15:33.481]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:35.482]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:15:35.862 --> 00:15:37.703]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:15:37.823 --> 00:15:39.644]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:15:39.744 --> 00:15:45.227]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:48.469]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:52.291]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:56.473]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:16:04.855 --> 00:16:26.041]  To talk about how widespread this is, I can open the phones up and take unlimited calls for four hours, giving each caller one minute, where they go to gun shows, you name it, just to get in the door after you pay your money, give us your driver's license, give us your social security number, Walmart doing it to buy ammo, and Aaron saw the bill, everybody's calling, they show you a bill,
[00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:27.081]  That's right.
[00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:48.675]  Uh, social security number because of child support bill, blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.495]  It's like U.S.
[00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:51.956]  Code 42-666.
[00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:53.276]  I said, that's weird.
[00:16:53.296 --> 00:16:55.137]  I don't want to give my social security number.
[00:16:55.637 --> 00:16:57.838]  And I pointed at it and the employee kind of laughed.
[00:16:57.878 --> 00:16:59.098]  He's like, yeah, that is weird.
[00:16:59.478 --> 00:17:00.839]  He didn't end up taking my number.
[00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:03.520]  But then again, it's probably in that system already anyway.
[00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.679]  But it's kind of freaky, you know, because they talk about Mark of the Beast and there it is in the bill number.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.204]  Well, you know, the law says they can give a license.
[00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:16.031]  It's illegal under the Privacy Act of 86 to ask for Social Security.
[00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.694]  So as soon as you said no, he didn't make you?
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.520]  See how it's all just color of law?
[00:17:21.401 --> 00:17:22.981]  And it was never supposed to be for identification.
[00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.021]  By the way, Clinton signed an executive order in 1997.
[00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:26.941]  This is in my film.
[00:17:27.522 --> 00:17:28.222]  No, 1994.
[00:17:28.742 --> 00:17:31.542]  But the film's in 1997 when I got arrested refusing the thumb scan.
[00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:36.243]  And I handed out the executive order where they said they're going to take blood and urine at the DMVs.
[00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:44.484]  Now, they never implemented that, but now they're taking blood at checkpoints, and they've admitted, oh, at birth we take every baby's blood for an illegal DNA database.
[00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:46.845]  Is that the right bill, Jaron Pernodoff?
[00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:47.425]  I don't think so.
[00:17:48.148 --> 00:17:52.650]  Well, the point is we need to dig that up and we need to go in there with a camera to Walmart and show people that.
[00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.131]  Yeah, it was posted right there.
[00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:57.332]  I pointed right at it and the guy was like, wow, you know, it does say 666.
[00:17:57.793 --> 00:17:59.513]  I mean, everyone knows.
[00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:09.578]  Well, have you ever noticed most bills are boring, but if you just go to thomas.loc.gov and type in HR666 or S666, it's always some really evil bill.
[00:18:09.878 --> 00:18:11.459]  It's like a little joke with these guys.
[00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:12.179]  Oh, yeah.
[00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:17.743]  But I mean, who would want to be associated with that number, knowing what it's associated with?
[00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:23.869]  And then it always is, every time you have to imprint or give your ID or, you know, embrace the government system, basically.
[00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:26.752]  Well, you know, the barcode's algorithm is based on a key of 666.
[00:18:27.472 --> 00:18:29.314]  And I heard that like 12 years ago and didn't believe it.
[00:18:29.554 --> 00:18:32.177]  Then I had the inventor of the barcode on and read papers on it.
[00:18:32.938 --> 00:18:34.960]  The key code used to make it work is it's based on a 666.
[00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:44.756]  Yeah, well, you know, it's real close to two-thirds in math, so... Well, that's why the Egyptians had it as the calculation in their temples to the sun.
[00:18:45.256 --> 00:18:45.536]  It was 666.
[00:18:45.597 --> 00:18:48.078]  So, yeah, it's the sun god calculation.
[00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:49.859]  Yeah, but to have... It's like 33.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.162]  To have it associated with the... See, 666 is a doubling of 33.
[00:18:54.343 --> 00:18:55.383]  And 33 is pi.
[00:18:56.064 --> 00:18:56.484]  Right, yeah.
[00:18:57.205 --> 00:18:58.646]  It's thirds, repeating six.
[00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:03.309]  Yeah, so that, I mean, but let you have the understanding, that's the number that this system works with computers on.
[00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.603]  How'd they know that 2,000 years ago, Aaron?
[00:19:06.244 --> 00:19:08.986]  I can't answer that for you, but it's strange.
[00:19:10.227 --> 00:19:13.630]  But they shouldn't be associating that with... It's just telling us we're slaves.
[00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:18.994]  Anyone who can read that number knows what it means.
[00:19:19.274 --> 00:19:18.994]  666.
[00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:21.476]  Hey, you ought to take a still camera.
[00:19:22.336 --> 00:19:26.780]  I think the little cameras are gone right now with the crew, but we need to buy some more little hidden cameras.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.241]  And we need to get in there.
[00:19:30.703 --> 00:19:32.144]  People don't know this is going on.
[00:19:32.184 --> 00:19:32.985]  They don't understand.
[00:19:35.017 --> 00:19:35.637]  It's real, though.
[00:19:35.657 --> 00:19:39.239]  I saw it on Walmart, which is already like Mark of the Beast land.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.981]  How was your trip to Florida to interview Dr. Paul Craig Roberts?
[00:19:43.361 --> 00:19:43.781]  Oh, it's nice.
[00:19:43.821 --> 00:19:46.743]  He knows so much, you know, and he's getting sick of the tyranny, I think.
[00:19:47.283 --> 00:19:48.104]  You think so, maybe?
[00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:50.545]  He seems fed up with it, yeah.
[00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:51.465]  Maybe he's evil.
[00:19:52.806 --> 00:19:54.367]  Maybe we're all bad.
[00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:55.627]  Maybe the government's really good, Aaron.
[00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:58.429]  Maybe they're doing this all for our safety, Aaron.
[00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:01.910]  DynCorp and Halliburton running the child kidnapping rings publicly.
[00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:02.851]  Yeah, it must be.
[00:20:04.073 --> 00:20:05.634]  Yeah, they're doing it for everyone's safety.
[00:20:05.654 --> 00:20:05.634]  666.
[00:20:08.615 --> 00:20:09.735]  Again, that's for your safety.
[00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:13.476]  It's for your safety, Aaron.
[00:20:15.677 --> 00:20:16.718]  It just creeps me out.
[00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:18.338]  I mean, it really does.
[00:20:18.898 --> 00:20:20.699]  I don't want to deal with these people anyway.
[00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:28.082]  And now they've announced, the head of the UN and Al Gore and all of them announced, oh, it's a global religion we're launching and you must be part of it.
[00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.302]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:20:31.402 --> 00:20:32.583]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:20:32.643 --> 00:20:35.045]  The churches are on the government payroll, almost all of them.
[00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:36.806]  Total tyranny is coming in.
[00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:43.150]  I'm going to come back and go to calls, and then I'm getting into the latest climate change development, where they openly have been caught in more fraud.
[00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:49.193]  More fraud is coming out with NASA, NOAA, all the other atmospheric research centers involved in the fraud.
[00:20:49.554 --> 00:20:51.115]  Total criminality coming out.
[00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:55.738]  And they're saying, we don't care, we're still going to ratify the treaty, which the U.S.
[00:20:55.818 --> 00:21:00.162]  can't get out of unless a unanimous vote by 190-something signatures.
[00:21:01.643 --> 00:21:02.243]  That's not good.
[00:21:02.944 --> 00:21:05.546]  Does that sound like freedom, where your country can't get out of it?
[00:21:05.926 --> 00:21:09.529]  Just like the United Nations treaty, where everything's backwards to our Constitution.
[00:21:10.148 --> 00:21:13.050]  Yeah, well, it gives you 29 great freedoms.
[00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:13.570]  Gives you.
[00:21:14.311 --> 00:21:21.376]  It says, oh, we give you this, whereas our Bill of Rights points out our inalienable, you know, God-given rights as a free, sentient being in, you know, in the universe.
[00:21:22.096 --> 00:21:27.280]  Their system says, then in Article 2930, oh, by the way, you have none of these rights when we say.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.243]  But most of their so-called rights are your right to be subjected to their eugenic system.
[00:21:31.943 --> 00:21:35.346]  And see, you hear them wanting to ban Christmas music in malls, that's the new thing?
[00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:37.127]  It's just about them setting the precedent.
[00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:39.569]  Like, no, we give you the culture we want.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.843]  And it's all about getting everyone at each other's throats.
[00:21:43.883 --> 00:21:44.584]  Thank you, Aaron.
[00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:47.508]  It's very unusual that you didn't like Bill 666.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.012]  You should have submitted.
[00:21:51.013 --> 00:21:51.934]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.415 --> 00:21:54.017]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.622]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:03.690]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.053]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:09.413 --> 00:22:11.154]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:11.454 --> 00:22:16.276]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:17.416]  How much do you want?
[00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:18.397]  When do you want it?
[00:22:18.777 --> 00:22:20.378]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:20.658 --> 00:22:21.478]  When will you need it?
[00:22:21.718 --> 00:22:23.779]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:23.939 --> 00:22:25.040]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.620]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:27.821]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:28.261]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:44.920]  I think.
[00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:05.276]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:05.396 --> 00:23:07.319]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:09.762]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:09.922 --> 00:23:11.785]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:12.205 --> 00:23:13.567]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:14.869]  There is a solution.

[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.943]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:24:04.063 --> 00:24:06.805]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:06.925 --> 00:24:08.186]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:24:08.206 --> 00:24:08.887]  It's very real.
[00:24:09.027 --> 00:24:11.148]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:24:11.268 --> 00:24:12.789]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.253]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:24:30.765 --> 00:24:33.488]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:24:33.588 --> 00:24:36.211]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:43.480]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[00:24:47.482 --> 00:24:47.722]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:24:47.742 --> 00:24:49.683]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:50.644]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:24:50.664 --> 00:24:51.945]  Hear the bell of the big guns.
[00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:30.090]  Okay, I've done two hours and 33 minutes here and haven't plugged sponsors or any of the things that fund this operation.
[00:25:31.564 --> 00:25:38.009]  But more importantly, the stuff that funds our operation is also the information that blows the New World Order sky high.
[00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:46.796]  So I want to encourage all of the listeners to not procrastinate and to order Fall of the Republic on DVD, my greatest film.
[00:25:47.637 --> 00:25:50.780]  America's last stand, make the choice liberty or tyranny.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.904]  Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[00:25:54.924 --> 00:25:55.864]  economy by design.
[00:25:56.385 --> 00:26:01.409]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.913]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:26:04.953 --> 00:26:08.836]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council.
[00:26:09.257 --> 00:26:10.398]  Thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:26:10.438 --> 00:26:11.679]  president to chair the world body.
[00:26:12.199 --> 00:26:18.086]  A scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[00:26:18.406 --> 00:26:21.210]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:32.155]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[00:26:32.915 --> 00:26:36.116]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:41.678]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:45.519]  This film reveals the architecture of the new world order and why the power elite
[00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:46.059]  Have a
[00:27:05.908 --> 00:27:07.910]  Join or die variant t-shirts.
[00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.371]  We have several different selections there.
[00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:17.197]  I added those because some of the Obama shirts in certain sizes are selling out, so if you can't get that, you can get at least the other shirt, which I think is one of my other favorites.
[00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:24.347]  Available at InfoWars.com and your purchase supports this operation that we're trying to expand against the globalists.
[00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:26.690]  888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to call.
[00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.750]  888-253-3139.
[00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.354]  And until Christmas, we've done this every year for almost six years.
[00:27:36.403 --> 00:27:39.928]  PrisonPlanet.tv, five and a half months free.
[00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:43.553]  So you pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free on the yearly membership.
[00:27:43.693 --> 00:27:50.763]  So instead of $5.95 a month, it comes down to three something, I forget the exact math, a month when you sign up in the...
[00:27:52.145 --> 00:27:55.527]  Month of December at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:55.547 --> 00:27:57.408]  The live TV show slash radio show.
[00:27:57.528 --> 00:27:59.189]  All my films in the highest quality.
[00:27:59.209 --> 00:28:00.530]  The films premiere there first.
[00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.292]  Expanded extras just for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:28:03.572 --> 00:28:06.394]  The behind-the-scenes interview with Dave Mustaine who's become a Christian.
[00:28:06.714 --> 00:28:07.674]  Woken up to the New World Order.
[00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:09.816]  His new album's titled after my film Endgame.
[00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:12.514]  We did that interview with him behind the scenes.
[00:28:12.534 --> 00:28:16.737]  It'll be about 30 minutes long, coming up Wednesday for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:28:16.757 --> 00:28:23.241]  We're going to premiere it live on the streams here at PrisonPlanet.tv, so definitely take advantage of that.
[00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:28.385]  And I wanted to tell you about one of our other sponsors, and then go to your calls, and then into ClimateGate, the Copenhagen meeting.
[00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:30.666]  Did you guys cue up Lord Von Rompey?
[00:28:31.747 --> 00:28:32.367]  Von Rompey?
[00:28:32.968 --> 00:28:35.129]  The clip where he's calling for global government?
[00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.473]  If you need to, Craig knows where that is, so pull that up where he calls for global government.
[00:28:41.393 --> 00:28:44.514]  And also, I want to cue up Al Gore calling for global governance.
[00:28:44.835 --> 00:28:45.755]  We'll have to stop there.
[00:28:45.795 --> 00:28:46.955]  There's so many of these clips.
[00:28:47.836 --> 00:28:52.057]  But for new listeners, I want to be able to play that coming up here a little bit later.
[00:28:52.077 --> 00:28:54.138]  I also want to tell you about Ecolablue.
[00:28:54.158 --> 00:28:58.000]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:04.062]  Though this isn't something out of a science fiction book, our sponsor Ecolablue with the Ecolablue 28 machine will allow you to do just that.
[00:29:04.422 --> 00:29:06.583]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons a day of water.
[00:29:08.684 --> 00:29:17.689]  The water, once generated, passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques, ensuring you know exactly what you're drinking.
[00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:19.170]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.251]  We spend so much time talking about on this show.
[00:29:21.592 --> 00:29:31.718]  Get your very own source of unlimited, renewable drinking water for you and your family today by visiting them on the web at acolablue.com or by clicking on their banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[00:29:31.738 --> 00:29:31.778]  800-691-6043.
[00:29:44.986 --> 00:29:54.112]  Now, let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[00:29:54.172 --> 00:29:56.154]  Let's talk to Zach in Canada.
[00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:58.495]  Zach, welcome to the Airwaves.
[00:30:00.076 --> 00:30:00.677]  How's it going Alex?
[00:30:01.357 --> 00:30:01.597]  Good.
[00:30:02.478 --> 00:30:05.880]  Hey man, I just want to thank you for waking me up at 22 years old.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.422]  I have a new lease on life now.
[00:30:08.462 --> 00:30:11.404]  My first question, I have a suggestion, actually my first suggestion
[00:30:12.368 --> 00:30:15.370]  Then a question is, you should get this guy, his name is Jack Van Impey.
[00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.891]  He talks about the New World Order, a Christian guy.
[00:30:17.911 --> 00:30:22.353]  I think he talks on a Christian station.
[00:30:22.373 --> 00:30:24.214]  His name is Jack Van Impey.
[00:30:24.254 --> 00:30:38.601]  My question is, I hear about all this world government and it's apparent, it's obvious that it's coming, but my question is, you talk about this one world religion that they talk about.
[00:30:39.662 --> 00:30:41.543]  My question is, who do you think
[00:30:42.182 --> 00:30:45.284]  Uh, would be the head of this, uh, one world religion.
[00:30:48.266 --> 00:30:48.987]  Expand on that?
[00:30:49.747 --> 00:31:02.116]  Like, um, the Bible would call it the Antichrist, um, my question is, like, who do you see, like, I mean, not even, not even biblically speaking, um, who do you see as kind of being groomed to be the head of it?
[00:31:02.797 --> 00:31:04.858]  Would you rule out Prince Charles, or?
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.122]  Well, regardless, it's world government, and
[00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:20.108]  People make the parallels to Revelation, a world religion being announced by the UN and the EU, a global system where all human activity is tracked and traced and controlled.
[00:31:21.929 --> 00:31:24.031]  It's just a hellish system that's being set up.
[00:31:26.152 --> 00:31:32.677]  My suggestion is that, I don't know if you guys would like, if you guys would get that guy on Jack Van Impey, but he seems to know what he's talking about.
[00:31:33.838 --> 00:31:35.159]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[00:31:35.179 --> 00:31:37.001]  You know, I'm not here to bash people, but
[00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.171]  You know, Jack Van Impey says Al-Qaeda's real and 9-11's real and all that.
[00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:42.511]  I mean, it's just neocon stuff.
[00:31:43.491 --> 00:31:44.551]  But thank you.
[00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:46.072]  I appreciate your call.
[00:31:46.652 --> 00:31:48.612]  Let's talk to... He certainly is entertaining.
[00:31:49.972 --> 00:31:52.173]  Jack Van Impey and Rex Sillivan Impey.
[00:31:52.893 --> 00:31:53.593]  Revelation.
[00:31:53.793 --> 00:31:56.194]  Tonight, George Bush fights the devil.
[00:31:56.894 --> 00:31:58.034]  When he's at Bohemian Grove.
[00:31:58.254 --> 00:32:02.435]  Why doesn't Jack Van Impey do a show about skull and bones and the Satan worship of government leaders?
[00:32:02.495 --> 00:32:02.695]  No.
[00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:03.875]  No, they're not going to do that.
[00:32:05.035 --> 00:32:06.196]  Dan in New Mexico.
[00:32:06.256 --> 00:32:07.116]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:07.516]  Go ahead.
[00:32:08.763 --> 00:32:10.444]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:32:11.105 --> 00:32:22.693]  I'm with the Alamogordo Second Amendment Task Force, and we branched off from the Anchorage Second Amendment Task Force, and I wanted to let you know that they are effecting some change up there in Anchorage.
[00:32:23.394 --> 00:32:32.100]  They actually got Palmer, which is right next to Wastota, where your friend Sarah Paley came from, they got him to drop some
[00:32:33.536 --> 00:32:43.406]  Gun laws that were restricting the free carry of people in the city because people spoke up and brought it to their attention and they got them to drop it.
[00:32:45.927 --> 00:32:52.791]  Yes, when we fight back against the gun control, the victim disarmament, we gain ground.
[00:32:53.211 --> 00:33:00.775]  That's why we have to get angry and be focused and know the globalist strategy is to restrict our guns at the county, city, and state level.
[00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:09.260]  And through color of law fraud, the feds have all the major gun shops and gun shows registering people to buy ammo.
[00:33:10.134 --> 00:33:15.435]  When there's only laws on that in Chicago, New York City, and in California now.
[00:33:15.915 --> 00:33:22.377]  So we've got to fight, because this victim disarmament, this slave disarmament, is really expanding right now.
[00:33:23.577 --> 00:33:31.119]  I sent the link to Aaron, so maybe you guys could put it up and show people that when you speak up and know what you're talking about, you can affect change.
[00:33:31.499 --> 00:33:32.239]  Good job, Dan.
[00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:33.120]  Appreciate the call.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.260]  Jim in Texas.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.180]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:35.580]  Welcome.
[00:33:37.481 --> 00:33:38.841]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call, man.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.100]  Welcome, Jim.
[00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:45.562]  Hey, I'm a non-commissioned officer up here at Fort Hood, and there's a couple things.
[00:33:45.602 --> 00:33:51.064]  You might have actually already talked about this before, but there's a base sticker you have to get.
[00:33:51.344 --> 00:33:53.324]  It's required to get on post.
[00:33:54.125 --> 00:33:57.766]  And with that, you get an RFID tracking chip in your window.
[00:33:58.386 --> 00:34:04.268]  And recently, I guess it's recently, they just started doing facial scans.
[00:34:04.368 --> 00:34:07.269]  And let me also state that none of my opinions stated here.
[00:34:07.819 --> 00:34:09.240]  Reflect that as a Department of Defense.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.341]  I don't want to get into any trouble here.
[00:34:12.822 --> 00:34:22.068]  Well, remember that when we got the Homeland Security documents and broke them in the MIAC reports, it states, Al-Qaeda is not what Homeland Security is for.
[00:34:22.188 --> 00:34:29.013]  The number one enemy of NORTHCOM and Homeland Security, because they're controlled by offshore banks, they're criminal,
[00:34:29.813 --> 00:34:30.614]  We're good to go.
[00:34:46.372 --> 00:35:03.779]  And so, the entire Homeland Security System, just like it came out in the newspapers months after we first broke it, the Army, internally, sent us that document, others published it, the Baltimore Sun reported on it, that the, in the Fed rallies, have Army intelligence watching them.
[00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:10.742]  Ron Paul, myself, and it says, as potential terrorists, no, the people following
[00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:16.627]  First Amendment protesters around saying we're terrorists are the terrorists.
[00:35:18.949 --> 00:35:20.610]  And I wanted to share with you something else.
[00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:37.044]  It's the Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 and that's what protects soldiers and their ability to go write letters to newspapers to express their opinions and to be heard on shows like yours.
[00:35:37.564 --> 00:35:39.766]  I heard an active duty soldier call in
[00:35:40.296 --> 00:35:42.437]  And say that he could get in trouble for what he was doing.
[00:35:42.858 --> 00:35:44.198]  But that's actually false.
[00:35:44.379 --> 00:35:49.702]  As long as you kind of follow the guidelines set up for you and that, you can do just as I'm doing right now.
[00:35:49.722 --> 00:35:50.062]  That's right.
[00:35:50.082 --> 00:36:04.791]  When you're off duty, as long as you don't talk bad about the Commander-in-Chief, or your superiors, or directly against policies, as a soldier, you can talk, when you're wearing the hat of a civilian, all you want.
[00:36:05.945 --> 00:36:09.528]  And look, sir, they're just letting you know you're being face scanned.
[00:36:09.548 --> 00:36:11.109]  You were always being face scanned.
[00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:13.130]  Face scanning cameras have been in for 20 years.
[00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.091]  DARPA put them in.
[00:36:14.992 --> 00:36:17.594]  License plate readers have been in for at least 20 years.
[00:36:18.194 --> 00:36:27.140]  Now, off the license plate reader, then the ground-based camera can identify off your license plate that that's Joe Smith getting out of his car.
[00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:31.347]  Then they get a heat resonance scan off your face.
[00:36:31.407 --> 00:36:32.529]  That's now uploaded.
[00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:40.503]  They get a overview shot to your heat resonance and then with satellites they can track your heat resonance
[00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:43.261]  I mean, sir, it's so Buck Rogers.
[00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:47.825]  That's why the head of Google is out there saying, yeah, we watch everything you do.
[00:36:47.845 --> 00:36:52.310]  You know, that's why Yahoo is openly announcing that they just give everything to the feds.
[00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.010]  No warrants.
[00:36:53.831 --> 00:36:55.493]  Local police can get everything they want.
[00:36:55.553 --> 00:36:56.114]  No warrants.
[00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:58.476]  It's just a lawless criminal government.
[00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:03.321]  Bloomberg's reporting that Goldman Sachs is arming itself with weapons against the public.
[00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:05.243]  They know they've robbed us blind.
[00:37:05.763 --> 00:37:11.907]  They know they're illegitimate, just like Stalin and Hitler and Mao armed against the people, and they want our guns.
[00:37:13.588 --> 00:37:21.734]  I mean, did the military at Fort Hood wake up when the MIAC and Homeland Security report came out saying the number one threat to America is veterans?
[00:37:25.597 --> 00:37:34.523]  I've always been a pretty big advocate of the Constitution, and I pass out pocket constitutions to my soldiers, and I regularly quiz them on what we're held
[00:37:36.473 --> 00:37:38.774]  By law, and by our God, to hold up.
[00:37:39.374 --> 00:37:42.656]  And that is the Constitution of the United States of America, and that is to protect the people.
[00:37:43.176 --> 00:37:53.619]  So there are lawful orders that we are uphold to protect and support, but at the same time, we have a right to defend that document over unlawful orders.
[00:37:53.639 --> 00:37:56.200]  I am into that, my friend.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.861]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:00.442]  How many soldiers are waking up out there on the base?
[00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:05.119]  How many soldiers?
[00:38:05.279 --> 00:38:17.464]  I'm in a smaller unit, so I couldn't really be specific on that, but you see a lot less of the George Bush stickers, obviously, he's out of office.
[00:38:18.044 --> 00:38:25.767]  And on all that, you don't see the neoconservative banner like you did before, and obviously with the new administration.
[00:38:27.867 --> 00:38:32.709]  You see a lot... I'm trying to not be specific on certain things, not to put myself in any sort of trouble.
[00:38:33.396 --> 00:38:37.138]  You see a lot of change, and everybody's waking up out here, Alex.
[00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:40.641]  So, the troops are aware of the New World Order?
[00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:42.382]  Absolutely.
[00:38:42.402 --> 00:38:51.748]  Well, we've been... There's a lot of stuff that I'd love to say, but I don't want to dissipate myself.
[00:38:52.388 --> 00:38:54.950]  Are the troops suspicious of the shooting out there?
[00:38:56.691 --> 00:39:00.033]  Well, Alex, let me just comment on that real briefly.
[00:39:00.789 --> 00:39:04.872]  And I had a good friend of mine, a non-commissioned officer, fellow non-commissioned officer.
[00:39:05.372 --> 00:39:14.199]  He was there and he was actually helping with the wounded soldiers and getting them to the ambulances and holding the IVs and whatnot.
[00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:17.661]  And he said to me that he saw the shooter on the ground.
[00:39:18.142 --> 00:39:23.005]  Now this could be just attributed to all the adrenaline rush, but you know, most of us have felt it before in warfare.
[00:39:23.746 --> 00:39:29.630]  But he said he saw the shooter on the ground, disarmed, shot several times, and he still heard gunfire.
[00:39:30.225 --> 00:39:33.309]  So, now whether that's true or not, I'm not...
[00:39:46.946 --> 00:39:52.690]  Imam, who's the honeypot for all these synthetic Al-Qaeda they've got.
[00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.193]  They do find mentally ill people like him, and they protected him.
[00:39:56.693 --> 00:40:02.417]  And Congress has asked Homeland Security and the Pentagon for that data, and they've declared national security on it.
[00:40:02.717 --> 00:40:11.263]  So bare minimum, it's like the first World Trade Center bombing, where their own informant said, they told me, cook the bomb, train the drivers.
[00:40:11.363 --> 00:40:15.006]  Then we were supposed to bust them, but they said, no, let the bombing go forward.
[00:40:15.806 --> 00:40:19.187]  And so, bare minimum, this was a provocateur action.
[00:40:20.307 --> 00:40:26.169]  I mean, no one else would be allowed to be running around the base and when he was in medical school saying, I love suicide bombers.
[00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:28.750]  Anybody else said that, they'd have been out in 10 seconds.
[00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:33.232]  He was protected the entire time and allowed to do this.
[00:40:33.672 --> 00:40:34.532]  And it's disgusting.
[00:40:38.053 --> 00:40:43.575]  On that, but my heart goes out to all those that were shot and all the families that were affected.
[00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:49.682]  But it does seem a little odd to us, to some of us, but, you know, once again, there's not a whole lot.
[00:40:50.243 --> 00:40:58.669]  Yeah, well most of my family are former military and they all just said, and a lot of them don't even agree with me politically, they go, that's, something's going on, that's a bunch of bull.
[00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:03.733]  I mean, anybody who knows, has got their head screwed on, knows a staged event when you see it.
[00:41:04.014 --> 00:41:05.715]  God bless you and I appreciate your call, Jim.
[00:41:06.316 --> 00:41:08.998]  We don't know exactly what happened, but it stinks to high heaven, doesn't it?
[00:41:10.535 --> 00:41:11.475]  Stinks to high heaven.
[00:41:11.696 --> 00:41:12.916]  Let's play Von Rumpy.
[00:41:13.617 --> 00:41:14.537]  Now there's so many.
[00:41:14.657 --> 00:41:16.538]  I could play the UN head, Ban Ki-moon.
[00:41:16.558 --> 00:41:17.498]  I can play Al Gore.
[00:41:18.019 --> 00:41:20.960]  Saying Copenhagen is the heart of world government.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.622]  For global governance and this is the year of world government.
[00:41:25.042 --> 00:41:32.185]  Now if you talk about this though, Homeland Security, the ADL, and everybody else are going to say you're wearing Nazi underwear.
[00:41:32.505 --> 00:41:33.926]  What does this have to do with Nazis?
[00:41:34.286 --> 00:41:36.267]  Only that Hitler wanted a European Union.
[00:41:36.547 --> 00:41:39.589]  So I guess those that want a global union are actually for Hitler.
[00:41:40.506 --> 00:41:43.567]  But, doesn't matter, you're wearing swastika underwear if you play this clip.
[00:41:43.827 --> 00:41:47.649]  Here's the head of the EU two weeks ago.
[00:41:47.669 --> 00:41:54.372]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[00:41:55.372 --> 00:42:01.795]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[00:42:04.116 --> 00:42:09.458]  Our mission, our presidency, is one of hope, supported by acts
[00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:14.725]  I bring you good news from the United States.
[00:42:33.792 --> 00:42:42.059]  Within one month of taking office, President Obama secured $80 billion U.S.
[00:42:42.179 --> 00:42:46.802]  for renewable energy and green infrastructure.
[00:42:47.803 --> 00:42:56.110]  And then just two weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed the Waxman-Markey bill, which
[00:42:56.909 --> 00:42:58.011]  For all of its flaws.
[00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:15.370]  What people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:20.452]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:43:20.752 --> 00:43:21.712]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:43:22.012 --> 00:43:24.993]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:43:25.093 --> 00:43:28.974]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:43:29.014 --> 00:43:31.995]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:43:32.236 --> 00:43:32.616]  Wow!
[00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:34.016]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:43:34.296 --> 00:43:35.397]  I was all struck.
[00:43:35.517 --> 00:43:37.017]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:43:37.037 --> 00:43:39.378]  This information can bless many people.
[00:43:39.838 --> 00:43:40.799]  Thank you again.
[00:43:40.939 --> 00:43:41.520]  Thanks again.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.603]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:43:44.824 --> 00:43:45.224]  Thank you.
[00:43:45.424 --> 00:43:48.428]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:43:48.848 --> 00:43:52.252]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.

[00:44:01.588 --> 00:44:05.233]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.614 --> 00:44:08.597]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.858 --> 00:44:10.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:13.623]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.643 --> 00:44:19.824]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:25.065]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:25.205 --> 00:44:28.366]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:35.207]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:35.327 --> 00:44:37.429]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:37.669 --> 00:44:39.010]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:41.533]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.713 --> 00:44:43.555]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:43.575 --> 00:44:48.619]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.764]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:45:00.362 --> 00:45:03.385]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:45:03.745 --> 00:45:07.368]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:45:07.648 --> 00:45:11.111]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:19.138]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants
[00:45:19.138 --> 00:45:20.159]  It's from municipal water.
[00:45:20.379 --> 00:45:28.283]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from the smallest to the largest systems.

[00:46:10.854 --> 00:46:16.384]  Coming up at the 8 after, we have the webmaster from Cryptome.org.
[00:46:16.965 --> 00:46:20.011]  Yahoo is threatening to sue them right now.
[00:46:20.732 --> 00:46:23.597]  Here's the InfoWars.com headline from Kurt Nemo.
[00:46:24.761 --> 00:46:28.303]  Yahoo threatens Cryptome over leaked surveillance document.
[00:46:28.844 --> 00:46:29.524]  No warrants.
[00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:30.345]  No nothing.
[00:46:30.845 --> 00:46:32.466]  The police want your data.
[00:46:32.486 --> 00:46:33.527]  They want your emails.
[00:46:33.567 --> 00:46:34.807]  They want your instant messages.
[00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:35.568]  It's just given.
[00:46:36.008 --> 00:46:36.889]  For a small fee.
[00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:40.551]  And then I thought I would just pull one article up from a few years ago.
[00:46:40.851 --> 00:46:44.854]  Missouri tracks scofflaws via pizza delivery databases.
[00:46:44.874 --> 00:46:47.515]  Give me a document cam shot of this.
[00:46:48.536 --> 00:46:51.178]  And it says that, and this is from many years ago,
[00:46:52.603 --> 00:46:54.664]  USA Today actually running an AP article.
[00:46:55.244 --> 00:47:01.667]  And it says, yeah, all the big pizza chains, when you call to get a pizza, they run a background check on you to let the police know where you're at.
[00:47:02.428 --> 00:47:04.269]  See, everything is a control grid.
[00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:09.011]  Face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, heat resonance.
[00:47:09.791 --> 00:47:17.475]  Remember I tell you 14 years ago how all babies in Commonwealth countries, including the U.S., were really basically a Commonwealth nation under the same agreements.
[00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:19.976]  Had your blood taken for a DNA database.
[00:47:20.396 --> 00:47:23.318]  Declassified earlier this year, exactly as I told you.
[00:47:24.318 --> 00:47:32.202]  Because I was reading University of Texas documents, how they were one of the four suppositories in the country.
[00:47:33.923 --> 00:47:35.304]  Suppository, depository.
[00:47:36.704 --> 00:47:36.944]  I think?
[00:47:58.203 --> 00:48:04.005]  Remember in my film Endgame three years ago, I exposed Dr. Watson as a top eugenicist who doesn't believe blacks are humans.
[00:48:04.665 --> 00:48:07.847]  He's the discoverer, the double helix of DNA.
[00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:14.709]  These are the crypto-Nazis, the underground... because Hitler got all his ideas from the US and England.
[00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:19.171]  He thanked US eugenicists and British eugenicists in Mein Kampf, or my struggle.
[00:48:20.342 --> 00:48:24.884]  And so the Human Genome Project's main goal is race-specific bioweapons.
[00:48:25.405 --> 00:48:46.155]  The problem is we're all so closely interrelated that say if Israel, which looked into this with South Africa, wants to create a race-specific soft kill weapon or hard kill weapon for the Arabs, they can't because so many Jewish people actually are Sephardic and so they actually have that Middle Eastern blood and it'll just wipe them out and kill them.
[00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:47.146]  Yeah.
[00:48:59.204 --> 00:48:59.924]  in black people.
[00:49:00.705 --> 00:49:03.366]  And northern Europeans do not even have the couplers.
[00:49:04.127 --> 00:49:15.372]  It's very hard for a northern European, and the studies are there, that whites who even have similar high-risk sex partners, especially northern Europeans, it's very hard to get HIV.
[00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:18.194]  But blacks pretty much instantly get it.
[00:49:18.674 --> 00:49:20.175]  But I'm now digressing.
[00:49:20.195 --> 00:49:27.158]  The point is they're taking your blood, and if they want to create a race-specific bioweapon just for you, the state-of-the-art science is there.
[00:49:27.238 --> 00:49:28.539]  They just go remove the sample,
[00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:32.801]  They can make the bioweapon just for you and then kill you better than a hammer.
[00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:36.423]  So that's how this loving system works.
[00:49:37.283 --> 00:49:39.404]  And so I thought we would go over some of that.
[00:49:39.464 --> 00:49:41.165]  But I already digress.
[00:49:41.225 --> 00:49:44.647]  I was just getting into the overall surveillance grid.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:45.780]  Success.
[00:50:14.346 --> 00:50:19.810]  But it is the awareness itself that will drive the change.
[00:50:19.971 --> 00:50:25.795]  And one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements.
[00:50:26.376 --> 00:50:34.442]  But the many business leaders who have been present here are among those taking leadership in other ways.
[00:50:35.463 --> 00:50:38.526]  We talked, for example, about... We'll be right back with the final hour.
[00:50:38.546 --> 00:50:43.570]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.569 --> 00:50:48.672]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.193 --> 00:50:54.437]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:50:54.757 --> 00:50:58.820]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:50:59.101 --> 00:51:04.505]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:04.845 --> 00:51:05.306]  It's true.
[00:51:05.586 --> 00:51:10.130]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:10.991]  Number 3.
[00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:14.554]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:18.597]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:18.778 --> 00:51:19.318]  Number 4.
[00:51:19.578 --> 00:51:21.940]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:25.724]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:26.004 --> 00:51:26.224]  Number 5.
[00:51:26.805 --> 00:51:30.728]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:30.949 --> 00:51:35.713]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:40.016]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:40.156 --> 00:51:41.738]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:44.039]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:46.541]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:52:08.297 --> 00:52:10.138]  Okay, here's what's going to happen.
[00:52:10.218 --> 00:52:20.380]  For two segments, I've got the webmaster of Cryptome.org really doing a great job reporting on just the open surveillance.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:22.481]  No Bill of Rights, no Constitution.
[00:52:22.861 --> 00:52:25.222]  Just need to let you know what's going on there.
[00:52:25.662 --> 00:52:33.584]  Then the last 30 minutes, I'm going to get into the latest on Copenhagen and the EPA in line with that saying they're going to list carbon dioxide that
[00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:40.765]  Humans exhale that plants live off of, that they respirate with, then they put off oxygen, that's the cycle of life.
[00:52:41.586 --> 00:52:53.560]  Taxing that, and Maury Strong is on record at the UN saying, we're going to destroy industrial society, make people so poor they can't have children, then the state is going to take everyone's children at birth and raise them in government dormitories.
[00:52:54.221 --> 00:53:00.085]  That's also in the White House Science Czar's book, how they're going to put chemicals in the water to sterilize you and the family.
[00:53:00.525 --> 00:53:09.071]  Just so happens the 150 plus on average, some it's over 300, chemicals added to your water supply under the product name sodium fluoride.
[00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:10.452]  It's not just sodium fluoride.
[00:53:10.772 --> 00:53:18.838]  Just so happened to sterilize all known mammal species, massively reduce fertility, and cause bone cancer, brain cancer, and attack the thyroid.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.741]  So enjoy yourselves out there while you're drinking that.
[00:53:22.761 --> 00:53:28.625]  And of course, if you don't believe me, just Google eco-science calls for global government adding chemicals to water to sterilize.
[00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:30.386]  You'll get AP and Reuters on that.
[00:53:31.387 --> 00:53:32.587]  This is your loving government.
[00:53:32.988 --> 00:53:33.988]  This is who runs things.
[00:53:34.028 --> 00:53:37.350]  This is the people who openly say they're already killing you.
[00:53:39.452 --> 00:53:46.836]  We're just supposed to sit here and take it and go watch the football game and go, oh, I love it that you take all the baby's blood at birth for your bio-weapons program.
[00:53:46.916 --> 00:53:47.937]  Oh, it's so nice of you.
[00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:52.529]  Let's play this clip of Schmidt, then I'll jam in a few calls if we have time.
[00:53:52.569 --> 00:53:56.993]  Here's the head of Google, who it turned out, his houses you can't see with Street View.
[00:53:57.253 --> 00:53:59.335]  His houses you can't see with satellite photos.
[00:53:59.575 --> 00:54:01.117]  His information's all protected.
[00:54:01.777 --> 00:54:11.727]  And he admitted three years ago, through a patent that Google got, they're using the audio sensor, the microphone, and the video camera to listen to you in real time.
[00:54:11.787 --> 00:54:13.108]  He said, don't worry, humans aren't.
[00:54:13.368 --> 00:54:14.910]  Computers are creating text.
[00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:22.414]  Like NSA text, Echelon text, that then do an algorithm, if they hear a dog barking, dog food ads pop up.
[00:54:22.494 --> 00:54:23.715]  Oh, you didn't know that's why that's happening?
[00:54:24.275 --> 00:54:25.736]  It's not just cookies of where you go.
[00:54:26.136 --> 00:54:32.019]  It's already in place, just they're listening to you, openly bragging, and this is what he has to say about it on CNBC.
[00:54:32.039 --> 00:54:35.842]  People are treating Google like their most trusted friend.
[00:54:36.442 --> 00:54:37.082]  Should they be?
[00:54:38.223 --> 00:54:40.344]  Well, I think judgment matters.
[00:54:41.004 --> 00:54:43.326]  Eric Schmidt is Google's CEO.
[00:54:43.922 --> 00:54:48.365]  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:54:49.326 --> 00:54:56.690]  But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time.
[00:54:58.091 --> 00:55:02.334]  And it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act.
[00:55:02.794 --> 00:55:06.196]  It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities.
[00:55:07.617 --> 00:55:10.059]  What a great setup for our next guest coming up.
[00:55:11.297 --> 00:55:28.191]  See, oh, from do no evil, don't be evil, to, oh, we don't surveil any of you, don't worry, it's no big deal, just to, look, we got satellite scans of all your heat residents, we're totally controlling you, we're already spiking your water supply, ha ha ha, there's nothing you can do.
[00:55:28.211 --> 00:55:29.472]  I mean, it's just, hey!
[00:55:30.714 --> 00:55:33.036]  You know, you don't deserve to live in privacy.
[00:55:33.076 --> 00:55:33.816]  You don't deserve.
[00:55:34.016 --> 00:55:35.217]  There's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:55:35.938 --> 00:55:37.399]  You are going to be surveilled.
[00:55:37.759 --> 00:55:38.800]  That's the way it is.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.362]  And we're going to use microphones to listen to you in your house.
[00:55:41.602 --> 00:55:42.562]  By the way, you don't believe me?
[00:55:42.622 --> 00:55:43.403]  Just use Google.
[00:55:44.023 --> 00:55:44.424]  Google.
[00:55:44.564 --> 00:55:48.006]  Google to use cameras and computers to surveil you.
[00:55:48.186 --> 00:55:49.747]  We wrote articles about that three years ago.
[00:55:50.008 --> 00:55:52.950]  With links to press releases by Google.
[00:55:54.096 --> 00:55:57.618]  And then Yahoo came out and said, oh, our system's better.
[00:55:57.858 --> 00:55:59.019]  We're surveilling you better.
[00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:03.762]  And then, again, this is the in-your-face system.
[00:56:05.663 --> 00:56:06.844]  It's way past 1984.
[00:56:07.264 --> 00:56:09.145]  It's way past.
[00:56:09.185 --> 00:56:10.326]  And here's another tidbit.
[00:56:10.526 --> 00:56:11.446]  Notice the movies.
[00:56:11.486 --> 00:56:13.848]  Every movie I see now has people being tasered.
[00:56:13.948 --> 00:56:14.568]  And it's funny.
[00:56:15.048 --> 00:56:15.989]  Torture is funny.
[00:56:16.209 --> 00:56:18.651]  And paying compliance is taught to all our police now.
[00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:20.492]  You can't torture Al-Syedah.
[00:56:21.516 --> 00:56:25.079]  You know, they sell us on that idea, but they are torturing these people for fake confessions.
[00:56:25.439 --> 00:56:26.720]  But then, oh, paying compliance?
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:37.108]  You can take a pro-lifer sitting on a sidewalk and break their arm with their bones sticking out, like I show in my film, Martial Law, and the police go to federal court and they say, yeah, paying compliance.
[00:56:37.288 --> 00:56:39.529]  They taser people to give urine samples now.
[00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:43.291]  You see all the videos of a young lady that doesn't answer the questions of the police?
[00:56:43.471 --> 00:56:44.671]  They just knock her teeth out!
[00:56:45.231 --> 00:56:45.571]  Ah!
[00:56:45.651 --> 00:56:47.012]  Beatin' him in the head with clubs!
[00:56:47.472 --> 00:56:48.792]  That's how this world operates.
[00:56:49.032 --> 00:56:50.032]  They're lettin' you know.
[00:56:50.513 --> 00:56:55.334]  You're here to supply the establishment, and then we're gonna euthanize you as soon as you get old.
[00:56:55.534 --> 00:56:58.715]  Just like the cover of Newsweek said, the case for killin' Granny.
[00:56:58.995 --> 00:56:59.535]  They love it!
[00:57:01.254 --> 00:57:06.457]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[00:57:06.838 --> 00:57:21.287]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[00:57:21.687 --> 00:57:25.330]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[00:57:25.771 --> 00:57:29.894]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[00:57:30.274 --> 00:57:39.442]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.

[00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:51.696]  Again, that is tpr20info.com.
[00:57:52.017 --> 00:57:55.060]  Or click on the TPR20 banner on infowars.com.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:55.961]  That's tpr20info.com.
[00:58:01.505 --> 00:58:05.168]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:05.508 --> 00:58:08.531]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:13.475]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:58:13.495 --> 00:58:19.761]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:58:19.881 --> 00:58:22.123]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:58:22.643 --> 00:58:22.943]  Tim Geithner?
[00:58:22.963 --> 00:58:23.383]  Bernanke?
[00:58:23.464 --> 00:58:24.244]  They're arsonists!
[00:58:24.264 --> 00:58:25.405]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:58:25.425 --> 00:58:27.666]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:58:41.553 --> 00:58:43.395]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:58:43.695 --> 00:58:48.541]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:58:48.841 --> 00:58:57.951]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:59:00.643 --> 00:59:03.244]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:03.664 --> 00:59:08.626]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:08.986 --> 00:59:10.727]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:11.027 --> 00:59:15.849]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.989]  How much do you want?
[00:59:17.209 --> 00:59:17.970]  When do you want it?
[00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:19.930]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:21.051]  When will you need it?
[00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.372]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:23.492 --> 00:59:24.612]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:24.832 --> 00:59:26.153]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:26.493 --> 00:59:28.735]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:59:28.895 --> 00:59:31.436]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:31.617 --> 00:59:34.819]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:35.219 --> 00:59:38.721]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.022]  How much will you need?
[00:59:40.262 --> 00:59:40.883]  We don't know.
[00:59:41.163 --> 00:59:42.084]  How much do you want?
[00:59:42.264 --> 00:59:43.004]  All you can get.
[00:59:43.204 --> 00:59:43.885]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.285 --> 00:59:47.047]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:47.327 --> 00:59:50.448]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:50.468 --> 00:59:51.569]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:54.931]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.741 --> 01:00:12.928]  Okay, I'm going to do a full breakdown on the Copenhagen World Government Summit.
[01:00:13.469 --> 01:00:16.694]  If our nation signs on to it, if the Senate ratifies it.
[01:00:18.336 --> 01:00:27.765]  191 signatories will have to unanimously vote for any nation to be able to leave total global governance over all carbon dioxide, all other greenhouse gases.
[01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:39.595]  In the words of the UN, Maury Strong, let's pull up the exact quote, ask Aaron for it, I don't have it in front of me, as many quotes, to destroy all industrial society so that eugenics can be carried out against the population.
[01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:57.159]  So that is coming up, but for the next 30 minutes we are joined by John Young of Cryptome.org, one of the best, it was kind of Wikileaks before Wikileaks on issues of government spying, surveillance, illegal surveillance, you name it.
[01:00:57.939 --> 01:01:01.262]  And they're really a clearinghouse posting and publishing a lot of this.
[01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:03.603]  He pointed out to me in an email that he didn't even break this.
[01:01:04.024 --> 01:01:05.445]  They just hosted the documents.
[01:01:05.785 --> 01:01:09.488]  Yahoo threatens Cryptome over leaked surveillance document.
[01:01:09.528 --> 01:01:23.459]  Yahoo, the internet corporation notorious for helping China implement totalitarian censorship of the web, has instructed its lawyers to go after Cryptome, a site that functions as a repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying and surveillance.
[01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:32.181]  Michael T. Gershberg of the law firm, and it goes on, sent a DMC takedown order notice to John Young, Cryptome webmaster.
[01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:41.524]  On December 3rd, the law firm claims that Cryptome has violated Yahoo's intellectual property rights and copyright by posting Yahoo's compliance guide for law enforcement.
[01:01:41.884 --> 01:01:44.185]  Young has refused to remove the document from his website.
[01:01:44.225 --> 01:01:46.706]  The takedown order is posted on the Cryptome website.
[01:01:47.586 --> 01:01:53.619]  And we've got his comments here pointing out they never registered it as copyrighted and he's being pretty sarcastic with them.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.086]  But it's good to have him here with us today.
[01:01:57.126 --> 01:01:58.428]  Mr. Young, thank you for joining us.
[01:02:00.285 --> 01:02:02.306]  Tell us just briefly about Cryptome.org.
[01:02:02.326 --> 01:02:04.466]  I mean, a lot of my listeners are big supporters of it.
[01:02:04.506 --> 01:02:06.887]  I've been learning a lot for many years from it.
[01:02:06.927 --> 01:02:09.988]  But for those that don't know, a snapshot of Cryptome.org.
[01:02:10.348 --> 01:02:16.930]  And this is only the latest persecution and visitation that you guys have had over the years.
[01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:22.272]  So perhaps give us a little bit of background on that and then this latest trip into Orwellville.
[01:02:24.172 --> 01:02:24.372]  Great.
[01:02:24.612 --> 01:02:26.353]  Good opportunity to speak with you, Alex.
[01:02:27.509 --> 01:02:33.811]  We set this site up 13 years ago to publish information that the government didn't want the public to see.
[01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:34.992]  It's its only purpose.
[01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:46.556]  We've since expanded into commercial stuff that businesses don't want the public to see, but most of it had to do with publishing government documents that they had rather the public not see.
[01:02:47.677 --> 01:02:55.880]  So people send us documents that they have access to, or we get them through FOIA, or they show up from unknown sources.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.700]  So we publish it.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.103]  Without editorial remarks, in most cases, and let the readers decide what they think about it.
[01:03:03.404 --> 01:03:05.206]  So it's more like a library than a blog.
[01:03:05.926 --> 01:03:12.951]  And so we have about 45,000 documents now on the website that have been collected and put up for public reading.
[01:03:13.852 --> 01:03:26.261]  The most recent series we've been putting up are telecom law enforcement compliance guides in which they are obliged to provide access to telecom records through the
[01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:31.425]  through official legislation established for this purpose.
[01:03:31.905 --> 01:03:37.746]  Most of these guides are kept private because the telecoms don't want the public to know that they're selling this information to the government.
[01:03:38.946 --> 01:03:43.247]  Christopher Salogian broke this story a week ago on his website.
[01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:50.108]  He's a student at Indiana University and he'd been doing research on this and asking for FOIA information and he was refused.
[01:03:50.888 --> 01:03:55.829]  But he did get copies of letters from Verizon and Sprint objecting to the release of
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.081]  We're good to go.
[01:04:10.521 --> 01:04:14.703]  And now they have thankfully verified it's authentic by saying, yes, that's ours.
[01:04:14.743 --> 01:04:22.728]  Just like the ClimateGate swindlers, the top UN scientists all colluding in fraud to hide the decline in global temperatures in the last nine years.
[01:04:22.988 --> 01:04:24.649]  They came out and admitted, yeah, those are ours.
[01:04:24.689 --> 01:04:25.469]  Somebody stole them.
[01:04:25.689 --> 01:04:27.250]  So it's always a nice verification.
[01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:27.970]  That's right.
[01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:38.156]  And so, along with the Yahoos, we've got about eight or nine others from telecom companies that have similar policies in place, which they've never disclosed before.
[01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.035]  It's
[01:04:59.005 --> 01:05:00.227]  There's a lot of fake ones too.
[01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:02.370]  We've noticed most of the ones we've gone through have been fake.
[01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:07.178]  We always challenge it with the federal filing and federal court and have beaten them.
[01:05:08.239 --> 01:05:11.083]  But that's if they try to carry the takedown order through.
[01:05:11.104 --> 01:05:12.385]  Of course, that's hard to do with all of our
[01:05:14.565 --> 01:05:14.905]  I don't know.
[01:05:44.104 --> 01:05:45.285]  Well, nearly all these are the same.
[01:05:45.925 --> 01:06:02.413]  They have set up policy to comply with the so-called CALEA requirement, which is Communication Assistance for Law Enforcement, which the law passed back in the late 90s to force telecom companies to comply with requests from law enforcement agencies.
[01:06:02.473 --> 01:06:07.135]  So they set up policies to comply with this, but also set up fees for providing the service.
[01:06:08.081 --> 01:06:10.883]  It turns out there's nothing controversial about the compliance part.
[01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:16.486]  It's the fees that they want to keep quiet, which has never been publicized, because they think that's confidential business information.
[01:06:17.247 --> 01:06:21.189]  So that's what they're fighting about, is the money they're making off this.
[01:06:21.689 --> 01:06:26.272]  Well, I've had the Feds show up here a couple times, and they just say, just give us people's names.
[01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:26.912]  And I go, no.
[01:06:27.973 --> 01:06:29.434]  Go get a subpoena.
[01:06:29.494 --> 01:06:31.095]  And they have subpoenaed us twice.
[01:06:32.816 --> 01:06:35.718]  And the Feds are like, well, usually people don't make us have a warrant.
[01:06:37.557 --> 01:06:44.580]  Well, one of the things that Chris Slogan found out was that there's an in-run that can be made with Internet information.
[01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:48.202]  Most of the tight restrictions are on wiretap of telephones.
[01:06:48.702 --> 01:06:50.303]  That's the legacy of legislation.
[01:06:50.363 --> 01:06:55.566]  But for Internet, they can go around by providing information through loopholes in the law.
[01:06:55.706 --> 01:06:56.666]  And that's what they've been doing.
[01:06:56.686 --> 01:06:59.568]  And that's what people didn't know about it, which Chris revealed.
[01:07:00.648 --> 01:07:02.069]  And that's what these documents show.
[01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:06.231]  They put up a brave front of showing they're complying, but they're in fact providing information
[01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.438]  That is not covered in the legislation.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:16.363]  And that's their emails, that's the instant messages, it's all itemized.
[01:07:16.383 --> 01:07:18.665]  You know, you want it, Yahoo's got it.
[01:07:18.685 --> 01:07:19.285]  That's right.
[01:07:20.426 --> 01:07:23.408]  And it turns out it's a very lucrative business.
[01:07:23.588 --> 01:07:27.130]  That's what was surprising Chris found out, was that how much money they're making off this.
[01:07:28.266 --> 01:07:40.394]  I saw a story last week where Sprint got 8 million law enforcement requests last year alone for GPS location off the cell phones, which is part of the Telecom Act of 1996.
[01:07:41.995 --> 01:07:49.961]  By law, October 1, 2001, all cell phones have to be tracked in real time off the GPS triangulation from the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[01:07:50.061 --> 01:07:52.722]  It's really 3 feet, but the law is 15 feet.
[01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:57.746]  And they can dial in and listen to what you're doing, even when the cell phone's off.
[01:07:58.746 --> 01:08:05.748]  So it's just a massive system and as insiders told me over a decade ago, the phone companies aren't tapped by the NSA.
[01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:07.168]  They are the NSA.
[01:08:07.368 --> 01:08:11.570]  They have whole floors of their installations where everything goes through it.
[01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:15.391]  It's like radio stations aren't run by FEMA.
[01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:19.992]  FEMA equipment by law is wired in as the last piece of equipment.
[01:08:20.552 --> 01:08:34.656]  that the transmission goes into the tower since 1996 with the emergency alert system everything goes through that FEMA control box that's controlled by shortwave where they can just take over all the transmissions of TV and radio with an audible signal.
[01:08:34.856 --> 01:08:35.196]  Go ahead.
[01:08:37.377 --> 01:08:39.358]  Yes.
[01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:47.160]  Okay, so run through some more of what's in these documents and then your eloquent challenging of this.
[01:08:49.022 --> 01:09:01.529]  Well, since our site is about publicizing information about technological spying, which we've branched into, anything that deals with use of high technology to spy on people is our main meat.
[01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:03.170]  So this fits right into that.
[01:09:03.451 --> 01:09:17.599]  And we get documents regularly, as do other sites, about this because the high technology stuff often is not disclosed about how effective it is, whether it's through browsing or through chat rooms or through various kinds of things that are very popular now on the Facebook sites and things like that.
[01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:24.755]  So Google takes a lot of hits for this, but there are dozens of other sites that are doing the same thing.
[01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:27.638]  But all of them have to run through the telecom system.
[01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:31.641]  So it's the telecoms that have the real control over all this.
[01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:35.344]  And so these agencies go directly to the people who run the technology.
[01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:42.650]  And so Google, for example, couldn't do what it's doing without these vast technological infrastructure.
[01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:46.433]  And so these agencies go directly to the source of the machines,
[01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:52.745]  And of course, the specs under federal law of the telecoms are NSA approved and designed.
[01:09:53.186 --> 01:09:56.047]  Cybersecurity Act really expands that, doesn't it?
[01:09:56.107 --> 01:09:56.427]  It does.
[01:09:58.548 --> 01:10:04.231]  They think that this heavy use of digital communication is a threat to national security.
[01:10:06.492 --> 01:10:07.553]  We think that's bombast.
[01:10:09.242 --> 01:10:22.071]  Yeah, they're just getting psychological algorithms to track and manipulate the population and protect their money laundering, drug dealing, a civil Edmunds, FBI translator, whistleblower, running Al Qaeda up until the day of the attacks.
[01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:23.492]  She's having to listen to this.
[01:10:23.832 --> 01:10:26.734]  Child kidnapping rings, that's come out in mainstream news.
[01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:31.498]  Halliburton, DynCorp, just the most criminal organizations the planet's ever seen.
[01:10:31.878 --> 01:10:34.199]  Hit teams, just the worst of the worst.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.181]  I'm ranting here.
[01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:37.762]  You're now challenging this.
[01:10:37.782 --> 01:10:41.244]  You're pointing out that they don't have a copyright on this and it's public interest.
[01:10:42.265 --> 01:10:43.365]  That's correct.
[01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:53.572]  The information is in the public interest to see what the telecoms are doing, which are public-oriented organizations and they make a big deal about protecting privacy and providing service.
[01:10:54.172 --> 01:10:58.095]  And they do not like to talk about selling the service covertly to government agencies.
[01:10:58.715 --> 01:10:59.516]  And they're all doing it.
[01:11:01.356 --> 01:11:04.298]  By the way, some of them do publish this information, but not all.
[01:11:05.119 --> 01:11:08.201]  And so that what they try to keep quiet is the money side of it.
[01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:13.165]  That they're doing it is no secret, but it's how much money they're making that is of interest in what they're trying to hide.
[01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:17.268]  Yeah, I wanted to bring... And so we think that needs to be known.
[01:11:18.849 --> 01:11:19.389]  Absolutely.
[01:11:19.429 --> 01:11:21.651]  I wanted to bring that up to you earlier.
[01:11:21.671 --> 01:11:23.432]  It's somewhere here in my stack.
[01:11:24.153 --> 01:11:27.415]  I was showing the USA Today from five years ago.
[01:11:27.995 --> 01:11:39.323]  Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery database and then it admits nationwide all the big pizza chains, when you call to get a pizza, run your name, your credit card, your location through a criminal database.
[01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:44.488]  And even for small fines, you get an arrest, not a pizza.
[01:11:44.788 --> 01:11:49.033]  And that's just an example of how everything is being wired in to this system.
[01:11:49.493 --> 01:11:56.461]  We're going to come back and discuss that with our guest, the webmaster, the head guy, John Young, at Cryptome.org.
[01:11:56.801 --> 01:11:57.302]  Stay with us.
[01:12:00.842 --> 01:12:02.423]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[01:12:02.644 --> 01:12:04.225]  You may have storable food questions.

[01:12:39.261 --> 01:12:40.663]  Just add hot water and serve.
[01:12:40.883 --> 01:12:44.047]  Backpackers consistently rate us number one year after year as the best
[01:12:44.107 --> 01:12:46.648]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:12:46.688 --> 01:12:48.329]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:12:48.349 --> 01:12:49.690]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:11.115 --> 01:13:13.776]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:13.796 --> 01:13:19.999]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:25.202]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:25.722 --> 01:13:35.347]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:35.467 --> 01:13:37.568]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:37.808 --> 01:13:39.128]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:39.408 --> 01:13:41.669]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:41.869 --> 01:13:43.709]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:43.989 --> 01:13:48.790]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:53.912]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:14:00.856 --> 01:14:01.696]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:07.238]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:14:07.418 --> 01:14:07.838]  I get it.
[01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:17.320]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.761]  That's not what's happening.
[01:14:18.981 --> 01:14:23.362]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:14:23.582 --> 01:14:25.262]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[01:14:25.422 --> 01:14:27.243]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.723]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:14:30.844 --> 01:14:34.944]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:14:35.124 --> 01:14:36.685]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:14:36.725 --> 01:14:39.945]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:44.306]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:14:44.486 --> 01:14:45.206]  You should, too.
[01:14:45.387 --> 01:14:46.367]  Find out what they know.
[01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:49.907]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:14:49.927 --> 01:14:49.967]  800-686-2237.
[01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:52.949]  800-686-2237.
[01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:53.169]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:15:00.327 --> 01:15:07.168]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:08.549]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:09.269]  It's very real.
[01:15:09.389 --> 01:15:13.149]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:17.630]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:20.151]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:26.072]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:15:26.152 --> 01:15:26.212]  Yes!

[01:15:31.134 --> 01:15:33.875]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:15:33.975 --> 01:15:36.596]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:15:36.676 --> 01:15:43.859]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:47.860]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.100]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:15:53.662 --> 01:16:05.348]  We are back live!
[01:16:06.089 --> 01:16:20.516]  johnyoungcryptome.org C-R-Y-P-T-O-M-E dot O-R-G Yahoo's lawyers say, you take that down, now we're charging fees for everybody's personal information.
[01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:25.329]  Where do you go from here?
[01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:33.311]  I mean, you again eloquently explained to them that this is a public service, that you have posted this information.
[01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:34.151]  Where do you go from here?
[01:16:37.172 --> 01:16:53.435]  As people look into this, is to start asking that every telecom company set up a privacy oversight board to look into their policies and decide what is confidential and what is for business reasons, what is in the public interest so that we don't have these gray areas
[01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:58.031]  of the telecom making their own decision without the public being involved.
[01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:01.832]  This is good democratic process to oversee these giant firms.
[01:17:02.953 --> 01:17:03.933]  Some of them have set these up.
[01:17:03.973 --> 01:17:09.795]  Yahoo was burned a couple years ago for revealing information about a Chinese blogger who was arrested and thrown in jail.
[01:17:10.235 --> 01:17:14.996]  They set up a privacy board to deal with international issues, but they don't have a privacy board dealing with U.S.
[01:17:15.056 --> 01:17:15.376]  issues.
[01:17:16.036 --> 01:17:21.598]  So we think that's what should be done, and that's what we proposed to Yahoo as a way out of their current dilemma with this document we posted.
[01:17:22.307 --> 01:17:30.872]  We happen to think the public should be more involved in what corporate policy is and not have other corporate people sit on these boards who themselves may be involved in the same kind of activity.
[01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:33.494]  We need disinterested, impartial people looking at this.
[01:17:34.915 --> 01:17:48.743]  So we think that's a good idea because privacy in the digital world right now is greatly at risk because every country that has a large digital infrastructure are passing laws to invade people's privacy more in the use of the internet and telephones.
[01:17:49.346 --> 01:17:58.810]  Well, a lot of northern European countries, like Finland and others, brag that the government just listens to almost all the calls and tells the people they're doing it.
[01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:05.373]  And Google, three years ago, said, we have patents for the camera and microphone in the computers.
[01:18:05.433 --> 01:18:09.855]  We're going to listen to you in real time and tailor advertising for you.
[01:18:10.516 --> 01:18:13.257]  I mean, they're really throwing it in our face, and now Eric Schmidt
[01:18:13.937 --> 01:18:20.599]  On CNBC said, hey, you shouldn't be doing anything you're ashamed of and you don't deserve any privacy, basically.
[01:18:21.379 --> 01:18:22.759]  Have you seen that video clip yet?
[01:18:22.979 --> 01:18:25.980]  Well, I have, and of course, I'd just like to say I think this is nonsense.
[01:18:27.881 --> 01:18:33.222]  That this is more of the bombast put out by corporations to say that we have nothing to hide, when in fact they do.
[01:18:33.282 --> 01:18:34.262]  That's the cover story.
[01:18:34.582 --> 01:18:37.423]  They're acting like they don't have anything to hide, but they do have it to hide.
[01:18:37.483 --> 01:18:40.244]  So they seem to be taking responsibility, when in fact they're not.
[01:18:41.227 --> 01:18:43.768]  And Google is doing that, and they all use the same technique.
[01:18:43.828 --> 01:18:47.649]  In fact, they're encouraged to take that technique to seem to be complying, but they're not.
[01:18:48.249 --> 01:18:57.872]  And now they're coming in with really the end of net neutrality, with this Internet 2, where they're going to not upgrade the older hubs, force you onto their new systems.
[01:18:58.752 --> 01:19:04.914]  Microsoft's new operating systems have a thumbprint where you'll have to biometrically get on the web and register yourself.
[01:19:05.834 --> 01:19:08.075]  What is Cryptome seeing in that area?
[01:19:08.935 --> 01:19:10.516]  Well, we think that
[01:19:11.869 --> 01:19:13.470]  It's important to watch what these folks are doing.
[01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:19.592]  You know, they're extremely astute with fantastic lobbyists to shape legislation in their own direction.
[01:19:19.652 --> 01:19:23.154]  That's why we think oversight of what they're doing needs to be involved.
[01:19:23.174 --> 01:19:24.694]  The public cannot leave it to government.
[01:19:24.714 --> 01:19:29.796]  They've now got government eating out of their hands through lobbying firms and by campaign contributions.
[01:19:29.836 --> 01:19:40.961]  We think we need impartial panels overlooking the public's use of these communication services because they're so astute now that they can pull this flim flam through the government.
[01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:47.816]  Because in one of the things they do, in fact scratching each other, they give government secret services for this favorable treatment.
[01:19:48.137 --> 01:19:49.360]  That's what we'd like to expose.
[01:19:55.171 --> 01:20:04.078]  And there's no doubt from your research, as I read the site weekly, that just the amount of surveillance and control is systemic.
[01:20:04.158 --> 01:20:19.630]  I mean, it's just everything's being surveilled, everything's being recorded, and government has gone from saying, oh, we're not engaged in warrantless wiretaps, to being caught lying, to just wide open, yeah, we're listening to everything, get used to it.
[01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:23.653]  Well, one of the techniques that they've evolved is that since
[01:20:24.557 --> 01:20:28.719]  We have a right to get access to government information through FOIA to some extent.
[01:20:29.179 --> 01:20:36.302]  They now use this thing called confidential business information to withhold information about the contractors to government who are running most of these systems.
[01:20:36.782 --> 01:20:38.202]  Government does not run these systems.
[01:20:38.262 --> 01:20:39.123]  Corporations do.
[01:20:39.663 --> 01:20:44.745]  And they use this term confidential business information to withhold information and that's allowed under the law.
[01:20:45.105 --> 01:20:51.888]  That's what Chris Salogian smoked out is that they were hiding this data using this hack term confidential business information.
[01:20:51.908 --> 01:20:52.868]  Now that was legislated
[01:20:53.436 --> 01:20:53.716]  We're good.
[01:21:22.091 --> 01:21:24.093]  And Google is the giant among these people.
[01:21:24.494 --> 01:21:25.515]  Microsoft is another.
[01:21:26.556 --> 01:21:29.719]  These great server forms that are being set up around the world now.
[01:21:31.341 --> 01:21:35.005]  Vast vacuums of everything that's passing through nearly all communication systems.
[01:21:36.502 --> 01:21:42.468]  And when the San Antonio media tries to go to the new NSA base and just ask questions, the police come out and threaten to arrest them.
[01:21:42.968 --> 01:21:46.612]  Well, I appreciate what Krypton.org is doing, sir.
[01:21:47.112 --> 01:21:49.314]  And I really want to thank you for spending time with us today.

[01:21:52.117 --> 01:21:53.718]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:57.342]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.131 --> 01:22:06.974]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[01:23:59.815 --> 01:24:05.002]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:24:05.122 --> 01:24:07.045]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:24:07.205 --> 01:24:09.488]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:24:09.648 --> 01:24:11.511]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:24:11.931 --> 01:24:13.273]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:24:13.553 --> 01:24:14.595]  There is a solution.

[01:25:11.838 --> 01:25:14.899]  All right, finishing up with John Young of Cryptome.org.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:20.662]  You're going to beat this Yahoo situation, I'm sure.
[01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.142]  Plus, they're coming after you.
[01:25:22.483 --> 01:25:25.864]  They'll only make everybody go get the documents, mirror it in thousands of places.
[01:25:26.564 --> 01:25:28.285]  I mean, can they really do anything legally?
[01:25:28.305 --> 01:25:33.107]  I guess they can sue you, but then that'll just bring more attention to their profiting from Big Brother.
[01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:37.169]  Yeah, and what they try to do is bluff and intimidate people.
[01:25:37.569 --> 01:25:40.130]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a
[01:25:40.675 --> 01:25:46.817]  A very large collection of documents where they faked claims of copyright to bamboozle people who don't know the law.
[01:25:47.137 --> 01:25:51.378]  And if anyone cares about this, they should go to the EFF site to read about it.
[01:25:52.038 --> 01:25:53.239]  So we think they're bluffing here.
[01:25:53.739 --> 01:25:54.779]  Nonetheless, they can sue.
[01:25:54.919 --> 01:25:56.239]  They're a large corporation.
[01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:56.640]  Fine.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:57.300]  Sue us.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:01.101]  Well, we appreciate your courage, Mr. Young.
[01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.441]  And how do people support Cryptom.org?
[01:26:04.342 --> 01:26:06.882]  Well, they can read our site.
[01:26:06.942 --> 01:26:07.843]  It's a public library.
[01:26:09.284 --> 01:26:15.608]  If they feel like taking a look at our archive, we offer that on the site, but mainly this is a public service.
[01:26:16.329 --> 01:26:18.791]  And so if you want to give support, support EFF.
[01:26:20.032 --> 01:26:21.753]  Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:26:21.973 --> 01:26:22.473]  That's correct.
[01:26:23.074 --> 01:26:24.455]  That just does an amazing job.
[01:26:24.775 --> 01:26:25.996]  Thank you so much, Mr. Young.
[01:26:26.796 --> 01:26:27.517]  And thank you, Alex.
[01:26:28.097 --> 01:26:28.818]  Appreciate you.
[01:26:30.765 --> 01:26:31.546]  You bet, thank you.
[01:26:31.766 --> 01:26:43.075]  Okay, let me briefly hit healthcare, then I'm going to get into the latest on the carbon scam and the world government meeting that is happening right now in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:46.758]  First off, on healthcare.
[01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:49.000]  This is so ridiculous.
[01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:55.926]  In fact, pull up the Newsweek cover of the case for killing Granny.
[01:26:57.386 --> 01:27:05.729]  And then if you can, pull up that ABC News article where they're teaching kids to commit suicide by 11 because their carbon footprint runs out at that time.
[01:27:06.609 --> 01:27:11.651]  I want to have those ready whenever I get into what's really behind the carbon tax.
[01:27:12.592 --> 01:27:13.532]  From their own words.
[01:27:14.212 --> 01:27:15.192]  From their own statements.
[01:27:15.253 --> 01:27:16.233]  I want people to hear this.
[01:27:17.878 --> 01:27:30.208]  But before I hit the healthcare issue, on the issue of Schmidt at Google saying, you know, none of our stuff really should be private and so what, you know, don't think it's private, don't have anything to hide, what do you have to hide?
[01:27:30.988 --> 01:27:34.932]  Meanwhile, you can't find where the Google CEOs and other top executives live.
[01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:36.433]  They block that out of their system.
[01:27:36.753 --> 01:27:38.434]  Here is AP today.
[01:27:38.835 --> 01:27:42.598]  Promises promises a closed meeting on openness.
[01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:46.960]  It's hardly the image of transparency the Obama administration wants to project.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.001]  A workshop on government openness is closed to the public.
[01:27:51.002 --> 01:27:54.263]  And then it goes into how they're one of the most secretive administrations since Nixon.
[01:27:55.224 --> 01:27:57.945]  And he makes it secret who goes to the White House and everything else.
[01:27:58.846 --> 01:27:59.986]  It's just incredible.
[01:28:02.187 --> 01:28:06.409]  So there is some of the news on that front.
[01:28:06.549 --> 01:28:07.510]  Okay, on healthcare.
[01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.393]  There it is, the case for killing Granny.
[01:28:11.854 --> 01:28:20.144]  And literally, I take Newsweek, every issue has an article about how great euthanasia is, or how good it is that people committed suicide.
[01:28:20.164 --> 01:28:21.406]  You know, is it good?
[01:28:21.446 --> 01:28:22.347]  Well, it is loving.
[01:28:22.588 --> 01:28:25.171]  His wife was sick, so he went ahead and killed himself too.
[01:28:26.738 --> 01:28:32.800]  And Tom Daschle wrote a book and he wrote the original health care bill saying above 60 you don't get eye surgery.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.840]  That's for young people.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:36.721]  Teaching you the pie is only so big.
[01:28:37.381 --> 01:28:42.223]  And if you're going to get ahead as a young yuppie, you've got to be for getting rid of this aging population.
[01:28:43.621 --> 01:28:53.404]  And in the bill it says 2.5 to 5 percent of your check will be taken for the new health care and quarter million dollar fines, five years in prison if you don't get the insurance.
[01:28:53.464 --> 01:28:54.424]  That's in the bill.
[01:28:55.284 --> 01:28:59.505]  And they've got tens of billions a year cuts in Medicaid.
[01:29:00.525 --> 01:29:04.687]  Forty-one billion dollar a year cut in Medicare.
[01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:06.227]  And that's conservative.
[01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:13.265]  And I get emails saying, you're an evil Republican, when I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:29:13.907 --> 01:29:15.612]  You work for the insurance companies.
[01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:16.658]  Every day.
[01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:18.618]  And we get phone calls on air sometimes.
[01:29:18.638 --> 01:29:19.999]  I mean, you've heard it, you see it.
[01:29:20.579 --> 01:29:38.262]  When it was in Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago that the healthcare industry and their top lobbyists for the insurance companies were going to pull out of support of the healthcare bill three weeks ago because Obama, under pressure from Democrats, wasn't going to make the cuts and wasn't going to force you to get insurance.
[01:29:38.642 --> 01:29:45.223]  Denis Kucinich, who I don't agree with politically on a lot of issues, but at least he's honest, I respect him, is an admitted socialist.
[01:29:46.528 --> 01:29:58.974]  And he wrote an article titled, you can pull this up, on his own congressional website, Health Care Plan is a bailout for insurance companies.
[01:29:59.874 --> 01:30:00.355]  And it is.
[01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.215]  They wrote it.
[01:30:02.276 --> 01:30:10.900]  Just like Dutch Rochelle, and it's in the emails, and BP and ExxonMobil are on record pushing the global climate tax.
[01:30:12.645 --> 01:30:16.566]  And then people say, oh, you work for the oil companies because you're against the tax.
[01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:28.289]  That's like the Federal Reserve and newspapers they controlled or owned ran articles by the banks, sponsored by them, saying we don't want the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 when it was for them.
[01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:30.770]  That's a simple trick.
[01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:32.370]  There's so many tricks they use.
[01:30:32.871 --> 01:30:37.452]  The insurance companies write the health care bill as a new tax to them.
[01:30:37.472 --> 01:30:41.213]  It's like insurance companies lobby that you should have to get more and more car insurance.
[01:30:43.564 --> 01:30:44.505]  But I wanted to go over that.
[01:30:44.685 --> 01:30:46.567]  Shell, cap-and-trade is a good thing.
[01:30:46.587 --> 01:30:51.532]  You know, I've got all these other articles where they're all behind it.
[01:30:51.592 --> 01:30:58.238]  And now it's come out in the hacked emails from the East Anglia University, the head UN climate facility.
[01:30:59.739 --> 01:31:01.281]  So, this is what they're doing.
[01:31:02.694 --> 01:31:05.896]  Now here is the article from Newsweek, The Case for Killing Granny.
[01:31:06.456 --> 01:31:07.217]  Here's another one.
[01:31:07.317 --> 01:31:10.318]  ABC website tells kids when they should die.
[01:31:10.338 --> 01:31:15.221]  InfoWars has a link to the article where you can read it in the News of Australia.
[01:31:15.861 --> 01:31:17.302]  And blow up that image.
[01:31:17.322 --> 01:31:19.784]  They tell the kids that little animals are dying.
[01:31:20.584 --> 01:31:29.013]  And that their carbon credits run out at age 11, so you should basically kill yourself, that you're not supposed to live past age 11.
[01:31:29.794 --> 01:31:33.438]  I mean, this is the level of the eugenicist.
[01:31:33.578 --> 01:31:36.281]  This is what is behind all of this.
[01:31:36.441 --> 01:31:37.403]  I've done the research.
[01:31:38.183 --> 01:31:41.026]  I made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:31:41.673 --> 01:31:42.914]  The Rockefeller Endowment.
[01:31:42.954 --> 01:31:43.995]  The Carnegie Endowment.
[01:31:44.816 --> 01:31:47.177]  The IBM started as a eugenics front.
[01:31:47.778 --> 01:31:49.519]  Hitler supporting all these groups.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.342]  Hitler learned everything from the British in the U.S.
[01:31:55.884 --> 01:31:58.506]  It's just that he only wanted to kill certain races.
[01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:00.508]  The globalists say, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:00.928 --> 01:32:04.131]  We're going to kill 80% of the world population.
[01:32:05.322 --> 01:32:08.104]  That's what Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers.
[01:32:08.144 --> 01:32:11.566]  In fact, I had you guys print me Maury Strong quotes.
[01:32:11.686 --> 01:32:20.312]  I mean, my only problem is I have too much, too much evidence of all of this information.
[01:32:20.672 --> 01:32:28.157]  Too much information to even be able to keep track of this anymore.
[01:32:28.437 --> 01:32:32.180]  Will you ask Aaron to print me that InfoWars list of Maury Strong quotes again?
[01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:35.130]  Ask him to print me that immediately.
[01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:36.590]  I mean, there's just so much.
[01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:37.231]  You know what I'm going to do?
[01:32:38.331 --> 01:32:40.432]  I am just going to, and highlight them again, thank you.
[01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:41.953]  Oh no, here it is, I found it.
[01:32:42.093 --> 01:32:42.894]  I found it, it's over here.
[01:32:43.534 --> 01:32:47.036]  Let me just read to you, and of course, don't believe us.
[01:32:47.296 --> 01:32:52.078]  When we post this, you know, when I read in
[01:32:53.649 --> 01:33:00.854]  Pulitzer Prize winning publications and books, in one particular one, about IBM and Margaret Sanger, I didn't believe them.
[01:33:01.294 --> 01:33:07.859]  I sent off to the University Archives and got the letters where she said, we've got to exterminate these black weeds.
[01:33:08.359 --> 01:33:09.780]  How do we kill these blacks?
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.841]  How do we sterilize them?
[01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:11.521]  How do we kill them?
[01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:15.656]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:33:16.076 --> 01:33:19.178]  More black babies are aborted every year than are born.
[01:33:19.418 --> 01:33:20.539]  But it's liberal and loving.
[01:33:20.579 --> 01:33:23.421]  See Margaret Sanger being thanked by Hitler in speeches.
[01:33:23.662 --> 01:33:25.063]  And she's still Woman of the Year.
[01:33:25.823 --> 01:33:28.445]  One of the most important women of the century in Time Magazine.
[01:33:30.667 --> 01:33:34.610]  Now, this is Maury Strong, founder of the UN Environment Program, 1992, at Rio de Janeiro, speaking.
[01:33:39.801 --> 01:33:43.944]  It isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse.
[01:33:44.384 --> 01:33:46.686]  Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?
[01:33:46.766 --> 01:33:49.388]  Maurice Strong, founder of the UN Environment Program.
[01:33:49.728 --> 01:34:04.318]  What did the co-author of this book, one of the previous science advisors to George Bush Senior, and best buddies who's co-written five books with John P. Holdren, Ecoscience, talking about sterilizing you,
[01:34:05.575 --> 01:34:09.432]  What did Paul Ehrlich, professor of population studies, say?
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:14.302]  A massive campaign must be launched to de-develop the United States.
[01:34:14.342 --> 01:34:21.525]  De-development means bringing our economic system into line with the realities of ecology and world resource situation.
[01:34:21.565 --> 01:34:25.668]  And they go on in these documents to say, we're going to do this by taxing carbon.
[01:34:26.068 --> 01:34:28.689]  And we're going to tell people that carbon dioxide is bad.
[01:34:29.049 --> 01:34:30.570]  What did the EPA announce today?
[01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:36.413]  They're going to list it as a toxic waste, in line with the Copenhagen initiative, the global government treaty.
[01:34:36.693 --> 01:34:44.583]  Which the head of the UN and the head of the Euro, the European Union state, is the control system for neo-feudalistic world government.
[01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:55.337]  Professor Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University, given society's cheap, abundant energy, would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun.
[01:34:56.618 --> 01:34:58.699]  Dave Foreman, co-founder of Earth First.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:10.087]  The three main goals must be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial infrastructure and the wilderness, with its full component of species returning throughout the world.
[01:35:10.768 --> 01:35:13.370]  And I can go on for hours reading you these quotes.
[01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:14.210]  I mean, Ted Turner.
[01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:19.994]  A total population of 250-300 million people and 95% from present levels would be ideal.
[01:35:20.374 --> 01:35:22.456]  That was on CNN, he said that.
[01:35:24.807 --> 01:35:32.573]  And then, of course, you read the Human Genome Project caught red-handed developing cancer viruses that they then add to the vaccines.
[01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:33.874]  Caught red-handed!
[01:35:35.115 --> 01:35:39.158]  I mean, these people are so devastatingly evil, and they're just frothing.
[01:35:40.779 --> 01:35:47.224]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates' dad, former head of Planned Parenthood, Bill Gates, Bill Moyers, talking about population reduction.
[01:35:47.564 --> 01:35:50.246]  These people mean devastating business.
[01:35:52.116 --> 01:36:16.515]  And all these fool yuppies, I talk to them and they say, well, anybody making over $200,000 or $300,000 a year, especially in any elite city like Austin, New York, LA, you know, my dad's a dentist and he's been invited to some elite meetings with some pretty big people, dinners, and they won't go to them because they're both, they're giving them the books they wrote about world population reduction and talking about how they want to kill everyone.
[01:36:16.875 --> 01:36:19.377]  My dad, who was in high school,
[01:36:19.757 --> 01:36:21.019]  One of the top of his class.
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:24.565]  They sent him to a UT Advanced Project when he was a junior and senior.
[01:36:25.006 --> 01:36:27.510]  They called him in to these meetings.
[01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:31.035]  Out of the 125 they selected, he was in the top six smartest.
[01:36:31.576 --> 01:36:34.180]  And Professor Spear
[01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:38.095]  Called him in and said, you need to be involved in government.
[01:36:38.455 --> 01:36:39.997]  We need to be involved in eugenics.
[01:36:40.797 --> 01:36:42.138]  Spears said, I'm Jewish.
[01:36:42.238 --> 01:36:45.021]  Hitler had it wrong wanting to only get rid of certain groups.
[01:36:45.321 --> 01:36:46.862]  It's actually all the bad people.
[01:36:47.142 --> 01:36:49.204]  I mean, this isn't me reading government documents.
[01:36:49.524 --> 01:36:52.947]  My dad can't go to cocktail parties with rich people.
[01:36:53.806 --> 01:36:54.907]  Without having to hear about it.
[01:36:55.147 --> 01:36:55.968]  It's all you hear.
[01:36:55.988 --> 01:36:59.651]  You talk to these stupid yuppies, and they go, oh, there are too many people.
[01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:00.852]  We need to get rid of people.
[01:37:00.872 --> 01:37:05.096]  It's kind of like Thrills, that little power trip view of the world.
[01:37:05.136 --> 01:37:06.477]  It makes them feel important.
[01:37:06.798 --> 01:37:08.939]  You know, pressing on the nerve of power.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.122]  Don't you idiots know you're being targeted as well?
[01:37:12.663 --> 01:37:15.645]  Eugenics isn't what you're taught in school of positive and negative.
[01:37:15.946 --> 01:37:18.408]  Advancing the healthier, smarter specimens.
[01:37:18.808 --> 01:37:20.710]  Culling the dumb ones, which is bad enough.
[01:37:22.074 --> 01:37:27.898]  It actually, the next tier of eugenics, when you deeply read, is targeting the intelligence groups.
[01:37:28.358 --> 01:37:30.280]  It's targeting the wild sons.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.641]  The bad sons, as they call them.
[01:37:32.681 --> 01:37:39.366]  The people that, the middle class wild seed, they call it, that has the genetic complement to challenge the elite.
[01:37:39.766 --> 01:37:41.127]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:37:41.607 --> 01:37:47.992]  They're putting cancer viruses, they've been caught, the UN's been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[01:37:48.552 --> 01:37:49.613]  I mean, the SV
[01:37:51.939 --> 01:37:56.902]  40 human papillomaviruses, all of this they've been caught.
[01:37:56.922 --> 01:38:00.464]  The Salk vaccine, knowingly, was in there.
[01:38:00.764 --> 01:38:03.665]  We have videos of Salk and others bragging and laughing about it.
[01:38:04.085 --> 01:38:05.626]  I mean, this is so evil!
[01:38:06.267 --> 01:38:18.633]  And you've got all these fools that think they're part of the power structure, and who think this is all cute and funny, and they've been let in on the inside track, and they've been let in on the big secret, and it's so much fun.
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:25.882]  So, at this United Nations Climate Change Conference, we've gone over the 200-page treaty here.
[01:38:26.142 --> 01:38:27.703]  Global governance, world government.
[01:38:28.543 --> 01:38:30.264]  Cue up Von Rompey again for everybody.
[01:38:32.485 --> 01:38:40.548]  They say that this will be a planetary government first targeting the Western nations that already have 1.2 child replacements.
[01:38:41.633 --> 01:38:46.399]  The Western nations, on average, have 1.3 children.
[01:38:46.599 --> 01:38:47.521]  For every two people, 1.3.
[01:38:48.522 --> 01:38:49.343]  Japan's dying.
[01:38:49.443 --> 01:38:50.144]  Italy's dying.
[01:38:50.885 --> 01:38:51.726]  Germany's dying.
[01:38:52.086 --> 01:38:53.468]  The United States is dying.
[01:38:54.089 --> 01:38:56.572]  All the original Western populations are dying.
[01:38:57.974 --> 01:38:58.475]  They're dying!
[01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:04.213]  All the major populations are dying, and that's exactly what the globalists want.
[01:39:04.233 --> 01:39:05.914]  That's the first group they want wiped out.
[01:39:06.154 --> 01:39:11.938]  But they're also running soft-kill operations on Africans, Latin Americans, Pacific Islanders, everybody!
[01:39:12.258 --> 01:39:13.019]  And they've been caught.
[01:39:13.039 --> 01:39:20.084]  I mean, just document after document after document after document that we cover in my film, Endgame, where they just admit they're doing this to everyone.
[01:39:21.735 --> 01:39:23.296]  And then now, here's the New York Times.
[01:39:23.396 --> 01:39:25.178]  EPA sets carbon crackdown.
[01:39:25.638 --> 01:39:29.842]  They're going to tax carbon dioxide, everything, listing it as a toxic waste.
[01:39:30.423 --> 01:39:31.624]  ABC News.
[01:39:33.906 --> 01:39:35.307]  ABC News, right here.
[01:39:35.507 --> 01:39:40.712]  EPA greenhouse gases endanger human health.
[01:39:43.288 --> 01:39:47.491]  And they list all these other gases like methane that cows have flatulence.
[01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:49.772]  New Zealand in places have already passed laws.
[01:39:49.832 --> 01:39:56.076]  Canada's passing laws to tax any type of animal that releases methane.
[01:39:56.376 --> 01:39:57.937]  Sheep, cows, chickens, goats.
[01:39:58.978 --> 01:39:59.458]  Everything!
[01:39:59.518 --> 01:39:59.859]  Geese!
[01:40:01.184 --> 01:40:08.007]  Schwarzenegger couldn't get the legislature to pass it, so he just said, I'm banning TVs above 40 inches and putting taxes on all others.
[01:40:08.487 --> 01:40:12.769]  Total feudalism, total serfdom is now unfolding.
[01:40:13.209 --> 01:40:25.333]  And all of this being done in line, Obama administration will formally declare danger of carbon emissions, including carbon dioxide, to be listed as a toxic waste.
[01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:32.612]  It only takes a majority to create the treaty, and Obama's going to sign on.
[01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:33.072]  You watch.
[01:40:36.493 --> 01:40:49.438]  But then, even if they don't ratify it in the Senate, the states, through federal bureaucracy, which is under UNESCO that Bush signed us back onto, United Nations Educational Cultural Organization, they are integrating this everywhere at the state level.
[01:40:50.359 --> 01:40:52.560]  Last week, the internal UN documents came out.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.782]  CNN, AP, they all covered it like it was a good thing.
[01:40:56.342 --> 01:41:04.627]  And said, oh yes, the UN has a global program in all the public schools with grade children teaching them to educate their parents, to rebuke their parents.
[01:41:04.667 --> 01:41:10.091]  New York Times described kids telling their parents, writing them fake tickets about taking hot baths.
[01:41:10.791 --> 01:41:12.772]  Next, they can have them spy on them for terrorism.
[01:41:12.792 --> 01:41:13.733]  They're already doing that.
[01:41:14.053 --> 01:41:17.135]  They're recruiting the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts for Homeland Security.
[01:41:17.155 --> 01:41:19.777]  I mean, this is just Orwell on steroids.
[01:41:21.957 --> 01:41:22.698]  I just can't believe it.
[01:41:23.018 --> 01:41:26.581]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:41:28.242 --> 01:41:32.145]  And the good news is, though, these emails got hacked.
[01:41:32.285 --> 01:41:34.206]  They got released to the media six weeks ago.
[01:41:34.246 --> 01:41:35.227]  The media wouldn't cover it.
[01:41:35.467 --> 01:41:37.229]  So they got then released to universities.
[01:41:37.849 --> 01:41:40.651]  And it's them and their admitting, oh my gosh, the Earth's getting cooler.
[01:41:40.951 --> 01:41:41.892]  We've got to hide this.
[01:41:41.932 --> 01:41:42.913]  We've got to hide the decline.
[01:41:42.933 --> 01:41:44.314]  We've got to persecute scientists.
[01:41:44.574 --> 01:41:45.535]  We've got to get them fired.
[01:41:45.575 --> 01:41:48.037]  We've got to keep them from getting their papers published.
[01:41:48.057 --> 01:41:50.359]  We've got to keep this out of the IPCC report.
[01:41:51.239 --> 01:41:54.302]  We've got to get with the government to block these FOIA requests.
[01:41:54.322 --> 01:41:57.305]  The government is helping us block people from getting this.
[01:41:57.825 --> 01:41:59.687]  Oh, we've got to work with Goddard Space Center.
[01:41:59.707 --> 01:42:01.249]  We've got to work with the UN to hide it.
[01:42:01.509 --> 01:42:08.535]  The three head climate facilities in England, the United States and Germany, all working together.
[01:42:09.036 --> 01:42:10.237]  The three that they draw from.
[01:42:10.277 --> 01:42:15.161]  And then you see the UN say, yes, this has been very damaging to our program.
[01:42:16.198 --> 01:42:22.102]  These emails coming out, but thank God that we still have the peer-reviewed journals that prove global warming's real.
[01:42:24.464 --> 01:42:32.129]  When the very peer-reviewed journals are using the data from the UN Climate Index that they integrated, that they created.
[01:42:34.056 --> 01:42:37.117]  But the good news is, I've got an article here with the head of the U.N.
[01:42:37.177 --> 01:42:39.038]  saying this has been devastating to them.
[01:42:39.858 --> 01:42:45.000]  And so the good news is, this pseudoscience, this fraud, is being exposed.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.202]  And we spend an hour in my new two-plus-hour film, Fall of the Republic, exposing this.
[01:42:50.262 --> 01:42:52.382]  It's free on YouTube, free on Google.
[01:42:52.402 --> 01:42:53.043]  Just Google it.
[01:42:53.343 --> 01:42:54.723]  Email it to everybody you know.
[01:42:54.803 --> 01:42:56.924]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:42:57.264 --> 01:42:57.964]  Make copies.
[01:42:58.044 --> 01:42:59.145]  Expose the scum.
[01:43:00.506 --> 01:43:04.753]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:43:05.074 --> 01:43:09.160]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:09.401 --> 01:43:14.269]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:17.157]  I think?
[01:43:41.244 --> 01:43:46.007]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:43:46.307 --> 01:43:50.329]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:50.469 --> 01:43:52.030]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:54.351]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:05.397]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:05.757 --> 01:44:08.779]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:08.999 --> 01:44:10.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:11.318 --> 01:44:13.759]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.779 --> 01:44:20.001]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:20.161 --> 01:44:25.203]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:25.363 --> 01:44:35.347]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:35.467 --> 01:44:37.569]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.809 --> 01:44:39.130]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:41.672]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.852 --> 01:44:43.693]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.973 --> 01:44:48.757]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:49.137 --> 01:44:53.901]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:54.141 --> 01:44:58.244]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:02.006 --> 01:45:05.390]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.
[01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:09.194]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved once and for all.
[01:45:09.514 --> 01:45:10.475]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.

[01:45:20.085 --> 01:45:25.190]  First, we stabilize IRS collection actions so you don't have to worry about the IRS seizing your bank account or paycheck.
[01:45:25.805 --> 01:45:32.453]  Next, we build a comprehensive plan to get your tax debt reduced to the fullest extent possible, sometimes even completely eliminated.
[01:45:32.934 --> 01:45:37.059]  And finally, we work with you every step of the way to get your problem solved once and for all.
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.021]  Call us for a free consultation.
[01:45:39.422 --> 01:45:39.782]  Call 1-800-346-6829.
[01:45:43.897 --> 01:45:46.200]  We'll work together to get your problem solved, guaranteed.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.345]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you, too.
[01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:52.647]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[01:45:52.667 --> 01:45:53.067]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:46:21.287 --> 01:46:22.768]  Alright, it's the final segment.
[01:46:22.808 --> 01:46:27.890]  We've got Lord Monckton on tomorrow from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:29.511]  Very excited about that.
[01:46:29.531 --> 01:46:30.991]  He's reportedly going to give us a full hour.
[01:46:31.772 --> 01:46:33.753]  But he's joining us from a cell phone on the ground.
[01:46:33.813 --> 01:46:34.773]  That should be interesting.
[01:46:35.694 --> 01:46:39.035]  His report, that I've read several times, is devastating.
[01:46:39.475 --> 01:46:41.216]  ClimateGate caught green-handed.
[01:46:41.236 --> 01:46:47.239]  You can go to Infowars.com and link through to it, or go directly to his website and get it.
[01:46:48.299 --> 01:46:49.480]  Everyone needs to see this.
[01:46:51.124 --> 01:47:02.036]  This program of enslavement, this scientific dictatorship can only stand if we don't get the word out and resist it.
[01:47:02.156 --> 01:47:03.037]  If we do, it's over.
[01:47:04.078 --> 01:47:07.242]  It's so diabolical, so evil, so wide-reaching.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.241]  That's why it's hard for people to deal with it.
[01:47:11.301 --> 01:47:12.841]  Like, the guys just gave me some more quotes.
[01:47:13.322 --> 01:47:18.544]  We sent off and ordered, If I Was an Animal, and owned the book.
[01:47:18.884 --> 01:47:19.844]  Cost several hundred dollars.
[01:47:21.165 --> 01:47:21.685]  Written back in 1988.
[01:47:22.325 --> 01:47:25.266]  A foreword by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
[01:47:26.307 --> 01:47:28.087]  One of the founders of the World Wildlife Fund.
[01:47:29.028 --> 01:47:34.310]  With the former Nazi, of course, the Dutch Prince.
[01:47:35.933 --> 01:47:37.073]  Founder of Bilderberg Group.
[01:47:37.794 --> 01:47:43.396]  If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
[01:47:43.696 --> 01:47:44.256]  Prince Philip.
[01:47:46.336 --> 01:47:46.977]  Here's another quote.
[01:47:47.037 --> 01:47:51.678]  It doesn't matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.
[01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.819]  That's Paul Watson, co-founder of Greenpeace.
[01:47:54.839 --> 01:47:59.601]  I mean that's the kind of things that these people are saying and doing.
[01:48:03.331 --> 01:48:21.536]  And now the UN, I meant to get to that today, I'll cover it more tomorrow, on the UN website says, world religion, Al Gore is launching it, that was in the 1996 biological diversity assessment, where they just calmly talk about how ancient cultures had it right with war and human sacrifice and pestilence.
[01:48:21.996 --> 01:48:23.296]  We need to bring that back.
[01:48:24.197 --> 01:48:26.437]  What did State Department memorandum 200 say?
[01:48:26.797 --> 01:48:28.958]  Henry Kissinger, CIA memorandum.
[01:48:31.027 --> 01:48:33.749]  As well, it was declassified under the State Department.
[01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:42.454]  He said, we need to tie IMF and World Bank money to the third world, to them reducing their population and their births by at least 50%.
[01:48:42.735 --> 01:48:45.977]  We'll also use war and famine to get the job done.
[01:48:45.997 --> 01:48:53.222]  And he also proposed people, if they didn't cut their food intake, wouldn't get IMF and World Bank funds, which is just made up out of nowhere.
[01:48:53.582 --> 01:48:55.063]  It's the case for killing granny.
[01:48:56.121 --> 01:49:01.005]  These control freaks see the world as theirs and they don't like us eating up their resources.
[01:49:01.305 --> 01:49:06.130]  They want the Hitlerian living space for themselves.
[01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:08.852]  They believe that they are God.
[01:49:09.212 --> 01:49:11.875]  They believe that we need to get out of the way for them.
[01:49:13.032 --> 01:49:18.258]  But the good news is, two weeks into ClimateGate, the establishment tried to ignore this, they tried to laugh at it.
[01:49:18.278 --> 01:49:21.040]  Now, governments are calling for investigations.
[01:49:21.461 --> 01:49:23.143]  More and more criminality is coming out.
[01:49:24.384 --> 01:49:26.807]  In Australia, the carbon tax failed last week.
[01:49:27.167 --> 01:49:28.608]  Members of the government are resigning.
[01:49:29.409 --> 01:49:35.516]  The opposition party to the carbon tax has now become second-in-command, frontbenchers in the parliament.
[01:49:36.926 --> 01:49:38.407]  People are now finding out.
[01:49:38.668 --> 01:49:41.210]  It isn't just a bunch of stupid tree-huggers that were wrong.
[01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:42.771]  They knowingly lied.
[01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:44.573]  They knowingly are eugenicists.
[01:49:44.593 --> 01:49:47.215]  They're knowingly complete and total sickos.
[01:49:48.256 --> 01:49:52.800]  The people are waking up now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:58.465]  The people are beginning to find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[01:49:59.929 --> 01:50:04.551]  The people are now ready to see endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:05.011 --> 01:50:09.612]  Whatever you do, get the YouTube, get the Google of this, email it to everyone you know.
[01:50:09.933 --> 01:50:10.793]  Don't stop!
[01:50:11.533 --> 01:50:14.274]  So you want to understand ClimateGate and the next level of this?
[01:50:14.834 --> 01:50:16.335]  What the UN says it's about?
[01:50:16.975 --> 01:50:21.737]  It's about cutting off your resources, then taking your kids, raising them in dormitories and sterilizing them.
[01:50:22.297 --> 01:50:26.858]  It's the Chinese one-child policy that the US and England paid them to implement in 1981.
[01:50:28.459 --> 01:50:30.624]  As part of a secret treaty now declassified.
[01:50:30.904 --> 01:50:31.786]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:32.067 --> 01:50:34.151]  Retransmission jam-packed starts now.
[01:50:34.491 --> 01:50:37.237]  Jesse Ventura, Lord Monckton, and others live tomorrow.
[01:50:37.538 --> 01:50:38.399]  Be sure and join us.
