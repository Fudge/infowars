[00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:09.363]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:10.943]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:16.705]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:24.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:26.667]  It has begun!
[00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:32.288]  The Copenhagen United Nations meeting
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.601]  Taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:40.143]  United Nations Climate Change Conference.
[00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.764]  Notice it's no longer Global Warming Conference.
[00:00:42.764 --> 00:00:51.389]  It's if the weather changes, you need to pay a tax and have home inspectors in your home and only have one child.
[00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.570]  Because weather changing has never happened before.
[00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.892]  The entire planet was a continual 76 degrees, 365
[00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.212]  days out of the year, for millennia upon millennia upon millennia.
[00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:11.952]  The oceans were always at the same level.
[00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:15.393]  There were always the same number of continents.
[00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:19.314]  Pangea never existed.
[00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:22.975]  Volcanoes don't put out carbon dioxide, even though they do.
[00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:32.018]  Carbon dioxide that plants breathe and then exhale, give off, oxygen that humans breathe, that is a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.182]  Carbon dioxide is deadly.
[00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:41.003]  It has begun the open takeover by world government.
[00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:45.305]  A declaration of tyranny against free humanity.
[00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:50.808]  A public declaration of world government is now upon us.
[00:01:50.808 --> 00:01:56.050]  War has been declared upon the people of the planet.
[00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.451]  And I will detail this after the break.
[00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.752]  EPA sets carbon crackdown.
[00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.080]  That's out of the New York Times.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:22.587]  A carbon crackdown on carbon dioxide, methane, and scores of other so-called global warming greenhouse gas causing gases.
[00:02:22.587 --> 00:02:27.829]  They are finalizing in the next week in line with the Copenhagen Global Directorate
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.364]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the equivalent of listing water as a poison, oxygen as a poison, mother's milk as a poison.
[00:02:54.977 --> 00:03:04.346]  This is absolutely outrageous, but it's what the dumbed-down, decadent public deserves if they don't wake up and say no.
[00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:13.474]  Russia Today did a devastatingly powerful interview with Lord Monckton, the best I've ever seen him, with precision laying everything out.
[00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:15.676]  I'm going to air this coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.241]  And he points out what I point out.
[00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:25.647]  This is a famous anti-Russian, a famous anti-Communist, the biggest anti-Communist in England.
[00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:29.550]  He's listed by many publications as being the biggest anti-Communist.
[00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.255]  Openly saying that Russia is 20 times freer than England.
[00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.856]  And it is!
[00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:41.622]  England has some of the most hardcore police state systems in the world by any measure.
[00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:42.763]  So does the United States.
[00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.931]  Now that's pretty sick, because Russia is not that free, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:54.455]  There's big problems with Medvedev and with Putin and everybody else over there.
[00:03:54.455 --> 00:04:04.181]  But that's how far we've fallen, that a hardcore anti-Russian, I mean he's been anti-Russia forever, is saying Russia is more free.
[00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.482]  But it's the truth!
[00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:10.405]  And the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth!
[00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:28.277]  And that's why the New World Order, last 888, launched sneak attacks on Russia last year, trying to get World War III started, because they can't stand it that the New World Order doesn't completely control Russia, and that Russia is threatening to torpedo the Copenhagen event.
[00:04:28.277 --> 00:04:38.722]  And I'm sorry to tell you, Russia and China are our best hopes in saying no to this, but China has been bought off and is communist, so they're going to probably go ahead and go with it.
[00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:41.224]  So is India, completely corrupt and sniveling.
[00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:45.485]  A lot of great people over there completely enslaved by the system.
[00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.466]  It's free humanity against the globalist.
[00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:58.451]  But yes, what your baby exhales, what you exhale, five and a half pounds of a day on average, now being listed as a deadly toxic chemical.
[00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:04.809]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.050]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.851]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:19.253]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:21.494]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:22.334]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.334 --> 00:05:22.835]  Bernanke?
[00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:23.515]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:24.796]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:27.037]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:48.213]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:57.323]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:03.100]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.445]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:10.487]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:15.492]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.492 --> 00:06:16.393]  How much do you want?
[00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:17.774]  When do you want it?
[00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:19.675]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:20.735]  When will you need it?
[00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.936]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:22.936 --> 00:06:24.277]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:25.818]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:31.080]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.662]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:38.124]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:39.705]  How much will you need?
[00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:40.605]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:41.705]  How much do you want?
[00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:42.646]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:43.726]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.726 --> 00:06:46.788]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:48.989]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:49.989]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:03.167]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:06.030]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.312]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:07:07.312 --> 00:07:08.132]  It's very real.
[00:07:08.132 --> 00:07:10.355]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:12.017]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:16.342]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:19.063]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:25.067]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.

[00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.691]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:35.412]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:35.412 --> 00:07:42.576]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:48.819]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.

[00:07:51.661 --> 00:08:01.226]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:06.849]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:42.652]  If you were a eugenicist that wanted to set up a planetary regime to carry out forced Planned Parenthood style eugenics, euthanasia of the old, sterilization of the general population, one-child policies for people who can even get the license, how would you do it?
[00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:45.834]  You would shut off the resources.
[00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:49.256]  You would declare the gas that all animals
[00:08:50.265 --> 00:09:09.437]  From chickens to cockroaches, from blue whales, dolphins, polar bears, Bengal tigers, lions, grizzly bears, fire ants, caterpillars, all animal life down to bacteria.
[00:09:09.437 --> 00:09:13.620]  Exhale, give off carbon dioxide.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.601]  That is the life cycle.
[00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.688]  Now I know the listeners, the regular listeners of this show know that.
[00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:26.749]  You didn't need me to tell you that, but the general public does not understand this.
[00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:35.270]  And many times we've made the point, and we've even played the famous Penn & Teller piece where they went out and did it, but the Australian television's done it as well.
[00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.251]  We've done it.
[00:09:36.251 --> 00:09:38.251]  It's coming up in an upcoming film.
[00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:43.912]  You walk out to the public with a fake petition saying, yes, dihydrogen monoxide, it's horrible.
[00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:47.596]  It can cause bloating.
[00:09:47.596 --> 00:09:50.698]  It can cause urination.
[00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:52.299]  We need to ban it.
[00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:54.980]  It's being released by factories.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.201]  Will you please sign the petition to ban it?
[00:09:57.201 --> 00:10:03.065]  And 90 plus percent of people will sign the petition.
[00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:08.047]  If you go to an environmental outdoor park meeting, 99 percent.
[00:10:08.047 --> 00:10:10.829]  In fact, we never found someone who wouldn't sign it at one of the events.
[00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:14.277]  Neither did Penn and Teller.
[00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:18.058]  Everyone said they would ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:10:18.058 --> 00:10:23.200]  Dihydrogen monoxide may sound scary, but it is H2O.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.820]  It is water.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:33.443]  Similarly, if you give someone the scientific name for salt, sodium chloride, 90 plus percent will say ban it.
[00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:34.644]  I've done it in airports.
[00:10:34.644 --> 00:10:36.325]  I've done it on trains.
[00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:37.205]  I've done it in the street.
[00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:46.016]  Anytime I'm arguing with a fake environmentalist, really a eugenicist cult member that doesn't understand what they're part of, talk about mind control.
[00:10:46.016 --> 00:10:48.798]  They're Nazis and don't even know it.
[00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:50.939]  And I'll say, should we ban dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:52.520]  Should we ban sodium chloride?
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.641]  And they will say, yes!
[00:10:54.641 --> 00:10:55.842]  Yes!
[00:10:55.842 --> 00:10:56.883]  Yes!
[00:10:56.883 --> 00:11:01.486]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they are now banning carbon dioxide.
[00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:03.847]  Attacks on breathing.
[00:11:03.847 --> 00:11:07.430]  New York Times, EPA sets carbon crackdown.
[00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:12.447]  Greenhouse gases endanger human health.
[00:11:12.447 --> 00:11:14.849]  They call it a form of toxic pollution.
[00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:30.440]  Obama administration will formally declare danger of carbon dioxide at the Copenhagen event, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, December 7th, December 18th, where they will attempt to ratify the treaty.
[00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:38.282]  And in the treaty is total UN control over every nation on earth.
[00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:50.050]  And once you sign on to it, you cannot get out of it unless there is a unanimous 191 country signatory vote to let you out.
[00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.893]  Absolute total end of America.
[00:11:53.893 --> 00:11:58.136]  We've already got world government, but now it's setting up an ironclad dictatorship.
[00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:12.224]  We have more United Nations documents, powerful article written at InfoWars.com with links directly
[00:12:13.564 --> 00:12:37.597]  To the United Nations' own website, where one of the directors of the Climate Change Conference openly has written letters saying we will create a global religion of the Earth built around world government, and that the entire elite of the planet have a consensus for population reduction, and that the general public doesn't know this or understand it, and that it's a good thing.
[00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:42.200]  I'm going to be covering that as well today.
[00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:47.943]  One of hundreds of government documents admitting this.
[00:12:47.943 --> 00:12:49.723]  Not hundreds, thousands.
[00:12:49.723 --> 00:12:52.324]  When I really think about it, there are hundreds of documents.
[00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:57.945]  Sometimes 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 100 times per book, per white paper calling for it.
[00:12:57.945 --> 00:12:59.185]  So it's in the thousands.
[00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:06.927]  This is just an absolute nightmare scenario that we are facing as a society.
[00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:18.037]  I want to go ahead and go to break and come back with a few more minutes of Lord Monckton on Russia Today because he lays it out so clearly.
[00:13:18.037 --> 00:13:21.821]  Lord Monckton will be joining us tomorrow from Copenhagen.
[00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:25.805]  Jesse Ventura is going to be joining us live tomorrow as well.
[00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.846]  Other huge guests coming up throughout the week.
[00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:31.393]  But here is part of the interview we have.
[00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:38.467]  You want to see the video, it's up on InfoWars.com of the Russia Today interview with Lord Monckton.
[00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:38.908]  Here it is.
[00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:51.858]  On the eve of the Copenhagen Summit on Greenhouse Gases, I'm talking to Lord Christopher Monckton, a renowned climate change sceptic.
[00:13:51.858 --> 00:13:57.143]  He's attending Copenhagen to persuade delegates that the science is faulty.
[00:13:57.143 --> 00:13:59.646]  Lord Monckton, thanks very much for talking to RT today.
[00:13:59.646 --> 00:14:03.670]  First of all, could you just explain your general stance on climate change?
[00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.962]  The climate has always changed.
[00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:07.523]  The climate is changing.
[00:14:07.523 --> 00:14:09.344]  The climate will continue to change.
[00:14:09.344 --> 00:14:15.889]  Humankind does not have the power to do very much about it, and we would be arrogant to assume that we can.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.904]  What evidence do you have that climate change isn't man-made?
[00:14:19.904 --> 00:14:22.527]  The scientific question amounts to this.
[00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:35.081]  Are the greenhouse gases that we add to the atmosphere sufficient in quantity and in global warming potential to stop outgoing heat energy
[00:14:35.822 --> 00:14:41.086]  Bouncing in from the Sun, hitting the Earth and then going back out into space again.
[00:14:41.086 --> 00:14:48.351]  Are they strong enough to stop it going out into space so that it stays down here and causes a little bit of warming?
[00:14:48.351 --> 00:15:00.019]  Well, we know that they cause a little bit of warming because the entire atmosphere keeps the planet around 18 or 20 Celsius warmer than it would be if we didn't have an atmosphere.
[00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:07.181]  So the greenhouse effect of all the greenhouse gases now existing in the atmosphere is only 18 or 20 Celsius.
[00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:08.121]  It's tiny.
[00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:20.705]  So the idea that changing one-two-thousandth of the composition of the atmosphere from oxygen to carbon dioxide, as we may do this century if we go on burning fossil fuels as much as we like,
[00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:26.227]  Do you think that climate change as it stands at the moment is a political fad?
[00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:40.809]  Of course it is.
[00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:42.690]  These scares come and go.
[00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.392]  You may remember the millennium bug.
[00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:49.034]  You may remember swine flu, which is another scare that's running at the moment.
[00:15:49.034 --> 00:15:52.336]  Virologists making a fortune out of saying it's all very terrible.
[00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:58.160]  In fact, the number of people killed by swine flu is smaller than the number of people killed by ordinary flu.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.721]  That's now blindingly obvious.
[00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:01.182]  It always was blindingly obvious.
[00:16:01.562 --> 00:16:08.845]  But the virologist got in there, whipped up the scare, made lots of money, just as the climatologists have been very successfully doing for 20 years.
[00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:12.487]  This is the biggest scientific scare that's ever got off the ground.
[00:16:12.487 --> 00:16:23.272]  But now it has come to an end, and it's come to a complete end, because recently, after 20 years of careful measurement using the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment Satellite,
[00:16:23.992 --> 00:16:32.796]  We have been able to determine that the amount of outgoing radiation escaping into space is almost as great as it always was.
[00:16:32.796 --> 00:16:37.859]  The extra greenhouse gases we're adding are making some difference, but very, very small.
[00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:41.701]  So we might be looking over the whole of the next century at a global warming of
[00:16:42.661 --> 00:16:46.105]  At most one, perhaps one and a half Celsius degrees.
[00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.468]  More likely just half a Celsius degree.
[00:16:48.468 --> 00:16:51.752]  Something which is negligible and generally beneficial.
[00:16:51.752 --> 00:16:58.059]  Certainly nothing that requires any policy action whatsoever, except to have the courage to do nothing.
[00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:08.381]  If what you say is true, why would the climate change lobby and governments either exaggerate or totally invent the threat of global warming?
[00:17:08.381 --> 00:17:20.844]  Well, we know that the class politique and the class scientifique, the great and the good, are conspiring together to make up the evidence because just weeks ago
[00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:38.543]  It was revealed that at the Climate Research Centre at the University of East Anglia, and among scientists in league with that centre right across the world, data had been blatantly fabricated to produce the desired result of pretending there was a problem.
[00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:40.524]  When there isn't one.
[00:17:40.524 --> 00:17:55.871]  And so, this news that data have been fabricated, computer models have been tinkered with, computer code has been tampered with, things have simply been made up, temperature records have been simply created out of nothing,
[00:17:56.651 --> 00:18:06.017]  All of this news doesn't come as a surprise to me because the people who were named in those emails are people on whom I've had my eye for some time.
[00:18:06.017 --> 00:18:15.864]  Others I'm in contact with have been noting the political and financial connections between these scientists and politicians.
[00:18:15.864 --> 00:18:26.131]  And so it's very clear that what has happened is yet another attempt by the governing class of the world, if you like, to take advantage of the little guy.
[00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:28.833]  To conspire against the governed.
[00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:36.559]  To have another excuse for exaggerated levels of taxation and of regulation and of interference.
[00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:39.481]  Isn't it a fact that the polar ice cap is melting?
[00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:43.204]  A hundred years ago people used to skate on the Thames River.
[00:18:43.204 --> 00:18:46.966]  Just in the last few weeks we've had enormous floods in Cumbria.
[00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:50.269]  Aren't these all evidence that climate change is in fact happening?
[00:18:50.925 --> 00:18:53.547]  You notice climate phenomena happening.
[00:18:53.547 --> 00:18:58.892]  You say, oh well, we don't know why these climate phenomena are happening.
[00:18:58.892 --> 00:19:02.174]  We don't even check whether they've happened before.
[00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:09.040]  So we'll just say, we'll invent a scare and we'll say that it's humankind that is causing these changes to happen.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.224]  And if I explain it that way, you can see how absurd that entire line of argument is.
[00:19:14.224 --> 00:19:17.667]  Yes, the North Polar ice cap lost 27%.
[00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:30.369]  And that is exactly, we're gonna back that up and come back, because they can say, oh look, it got 27% smaller in the summer, but it came back the next winter.
[00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:36.516]  But see, they play little statistical games, and when you read the Club of Rome and UN documents from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, they talk about inventing.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:50.503]  They think you're so stupid they have public reports talking about how they just invented it to make you the enemy so they can cut your resources off and not let you have children.
[00:19:50.503 --> 00:19:52.944]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:19:52.944 --> 00:19:54.645]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:54.645 --> 00:20:02.307]  They know it's a fraud and the emails just prove that that much more.
[00:20:02.307 --> 00:20:03.507]  This is not a drill.
[00:20:03.507 --> 00:20:05.388]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:08.909]  We're good to go.
[00:20:30.469 --> 00:20:31.089]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.069 --> 00:21:02.231]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:03.092]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:03.413]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.413 --> 00:21:08.478]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:10.099]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:10.840]  Startpage?
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.261]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:12.362]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.362 --> 00:21:15.325]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.325 --> 00:21:19.189]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.189 --> 00:21:21.992]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.332 --> 00:21:24.533]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.534]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.534 --> 00:21:26.815]  Right!
[00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:30.137]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.137 --> 00:21:30.717]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:30.717 --> 00:21:32.058]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.058 --> 00:21:35.920]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.702]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:39.702 --> 00:21:44.865]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:47.787]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:48.257 --> 00:21:49.998]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:49.998 --> 00:21:54.301]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:54.301 --> 00:21:59.885]  That's StartPage.com.
[00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:04.008]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[00:22:04.008 --> 00:22:08.271]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:09.852]  You get less for your money.
[00:22:09.852 --> 00:22:15.696]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[00:22:16.757 --> 00:22:20.659]  Call 800-686-2237 extension 135.
[00:22:20.659 --> 00:22:22.000]  You've worked hard for your dollars.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.583]  Don't let the government strip their buying power with wasteful spending.
[00:22:25.583 --> 00:22:28.685]  Gold has a 5,000 year track record as money.
[00:22:28.685 --> 00:22:30.306]  Real money you can count on.
[00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:33.168]  No government backed paper currency comes close.
[00:22:33.168 --> 00:22:35.770]  Ask me about the protection of private gold.
[00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.412]  Call Peter May at Midas Resources 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.496 --> 00:22:42.197]  We're good.
[00:23:00.086 --> 00:23:09.490]  If you have more than $25,000 in debt and are facing foreclosure, we can stop the foreclosure in one day and get you out of debt in 90 days without making a single payment.
[00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:18.094]  Did you know that debt settlement is illegal in at least 7 states and that if you hire an attorney to help you get out of debt, you'll pay 7 to 10 times more than legally necessary?
[00:23:18.094 --> 00:23:19.175]  The system is rigged.
[00:23:19.335 --> 00:23:24.880]  These guys get kickbacks from your creditors while charging you up front to get into nothing more than just another payment plan.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.441]  Look, this isn't brain surgery.
[00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:30.165]  You just need the right information and the right help and answers to your questions.
[00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:34.628]  No clients of Zero Debt in 90 Days have had to negotiate with creditors or go to court.
[00:23:34.628 --> 00:23:37.411]  Our proven system stops collection calls in one minute.
[00:23:37.611 --> 00:23:43.034]  Since 1993, we have helped over 80,000 people get out of debt without making a single payment to creditors.

[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.701]  Okay, let's go back to Lord Moncton.
[00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:25.682]  Yes, the North Polar Ice Cap lost 27% of the ice that is normally there at the summer minimum in 2007, compared with that which we had known was normal from 30 years of satellite observations.
[00:24:25.682 --> 00:24:27.543]  But it's grown back by 24% in the last two years.
[00:24:30.313 --> 00:24:33.376]  So that shows the enormous volatility of the Arctic climate.
[00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:34.297]  It's famous for it.
[00:24:34.297 --> 00:24:37.441]  And the floods in Cumbria, a thousand-year event.
[00:24:37.441 --> 00:24:48.012]  But you see, if you take a hundred different microclimates which exist in Britain, and there are ten different climatic extreme events that could happen in each one, you're going to get a thousand-year event once a year.
[00:24:48.693 --> 00:24:52.516]  These extreme weather events come around just as they always have.
[00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:55.959]  In any chaotic object, mathematically speaking, you would expect this to happen.
[00:24:55.959 --> 00:25:00.664]  It tells us nothing about whether the world is steadily warming.
[00:25:00.664 --> 00:25:02.865]  Yes, it has been warming for 300 years, during 280 of which...
[00:25:06.092 --> 00:25:07.834]  We couldn't have had anything to do with it.
[00:25:07.834 --> 00:25:10.856]  And the Antarctic ice cap is expanding.
[00:25:10.856 --> 00:25:20.004]  The sea ice in the Antarctic reached a record extent in 2007, three weeks after the record minimum in the Arctic.
[00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:22.266]  There was a record maximum in the Antarctic.
[00:25:22.717 --> 00:25:32.385]  The IPCC has a huge body of seemingly solid scientific evidence behind it, and they say that it's 90% likely that climate change is man-made.
[00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:33.826]  How do you refute that?
[00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:43.694]  There is no scientific basis whatsoever for saying there is a 90% probability that most of the warming of the last 50 years was caused by humankind.
[00:25:43.694 --> 00:25:44.455]  None whatsoever.
[00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:54.485]  You could go, for instance, to a paper by Scaffetta and West just last year, saying that 69% of all the warming of the last 50 years was caused by the sun.
[00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:57.207]  I'm not entirely convinced by that argument either.
[00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:59.390]  The fact is we have no means of knowing
[00:26:00.402 --> 00:26:06.404]  What are the influences that cause the climate to fluctuate in the short term, upwards or downwards?
[00:26:06.404 --> 00:26:09.346]  This is simply beyond our capacity to measure or analyse.
[00:26:09.346 --> 00:26:20.010]  What we do know, and this we can do by laboratory experiment and by a little bit of elementary mathematics, is what the maximum possible effect of adding CO2 to the atmosphere can be.
[00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.011]  And the answer is, it's very, very, very small.
[00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:33.064]  Even if climate change theory hasn't been entirely put to the test, isn't it better to do something now rather than wait for flooding, drought and temperature rises?
[00:26:33.641 --> 00:26:45.331]  The precautions themselves, let us say, in the shape of replacing one third of the world's agricultural land, which grew food, with growing biofuels instead.
[00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:47.653]  So we were once growing food for people that needed it.
[00:26:47.653 --> 00:26:50.115]  Now we grow biofuels for clunkers that don't.
[00:26:50.115 --> 00:26:50.955]  Result?
[00:26:50.955 --> 00:26:54.919]  A doubling of world food prices in just over a year.
[00:26:54.919 --> 00:27:00.944]  Three quarters of which was attributed by the World Bank to this biofuel scam which comes out of the global warming scare.
[00:27:00.944 --> 00:27:01.284]  Result?
[00:27:02.563 --> 00:27:06.325]  If we have to pay twice as much for our food, it's inconvenient.
[00:27:06.325 --> 00:27:15.191]  If you're in a poor country, that difference of 100% in the price of your food is the difference between life and death.
[00:27:15.191 --> 00:27:27.659]  There have been major food riots in a dozen regions of the world, hardly reported at all in the West, because they're so busy reporting on every little icicle putatively dribbling in Greenland.
[00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:41.498]  And those food riots are happening because people are dying by the million of starvation who would not have died at all had this climate scare not engendered this dash for biofuels.
[00:27:41.498 --> 00:27:45.060]  What do you think will happen to the climate in, say, the next hundred years?
[00:27:45.882 --> 00:28:03.128]  I asked the world's greatest expert on climate, that, and that is Professor Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, generally recognised to be the man who knows more than anyone else in the world about how the atmosphere will behave.
[00:28:03.128 --> 00:28:11.551]  And I said to him, Dick, I said, I've been asked to make a bet on whether it's going to be warmer or cooler in the next 50 years.
[00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:12.191]  Can you tell me?
[00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:14.792]  He said, yes, I can.
[00:28:14.792 --> 00:28:19.156]  It will be either warmer, or the same as today, or cooler.
[00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:25.120]  And the chances that it will be warmer are exactly the same as the chances that it will be cooler.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.563]  And you're going to the Copenhagen Summit on Greenhouse Gases.
[00:28:28.563 --> 00:28:30.384]  What's your objective there?
[00:28:30.384 --> 00:28:41.293]  My objective at Copenhagen will be to say to the leading delegations there, in particular the Americans, the Canadians, the Japanese, the Australians, the New Zealanders... Okay.
[00:28:41.293 --> 00:28:42.214]  I'm gonna come back
[00:28:43.533 --> 00:28:50.096]  And probably the last two minutes of the interview where he talks about what his objective in Copenhagen will be and what all of our objectives should be.
[00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:54.658]  And I'm going to give you the latest developments on Climategate.
[00:28:54.658 --> 00:29:00.821]  We are also going to get into the treaty itself, the establishment of world government.
[00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:05.883]  And the biggest news, now this is old news for our listeners, but they're really doing it.
[00:29:05.883 --> 00:29:12.367]  The EPA has announced this morning they will list by the end of the Copenhagen event, December 18th,
[00:29:14.693 --> 00:29:17.374]  It goes for 11-12 days.
[00:29:17.374 --> 00:29:23.515]  They will announce carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[00:29:23.515 --> 00:29:26.456]  This is unbelievable scientific fraud.
[00:29:26.456 --> 00:29:31.618]  This is a fraud as big as saying the moon is made of...
[00:29:33.643 --> 00:29:35.604]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:35.604 --> 00:29:38.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:06.342]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:05.037]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:09.563]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:31:09.563 --> 00:31:11.846]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:31:11.846 --> 00:31:13.468]  You don't have to cooperate.

[00:31:59.636 --> 00:32:04.178]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.178 --> 00:32:05.079]  Number one.
[00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:08.521]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.521 --> 00:32:09.381]  Number two.
[00:32:09.381 --> 00:32:14.264]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.264 --> 00:32:15.024]  It's true.
[00:32:15.024 --> 00:32:19.567]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.867 --> 00:32:20.708]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.708 --> 00:32:24.291]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:28.215]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:28.995]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:31.758]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.758 --> 00:32:35.441]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:36.242]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.242 --> 00:32:40.386]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.386 --> 00:32:45.150]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:49.597]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.597 --> 00:32:51.380]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.643]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.643 --> 00:32:55.987]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:11.952 --> 00:33:20.879]  All right, let's finish up with Lord Monckton with what he's going to be doing at the Copenhagen event that started this morning.
[00:33:20.879 --> 00:33:25.182]  Started about eight hours ago in Denmark.
[00:33:25.182 --> 00:33:27.404]  The world government openly being announced.
[00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:29.366]  This is what he is planning to do.
[00:33:29.366 --> 00:33:36.311]  He is scheduled to be joining us tomorrow for a full hour via cell phone from the conference.
[00:33:36.311 --> 00:33:37.792]  That should be wild.
[00:33:37.792 --> 00:33:38.573]  But here it is.
[00:33:40.662 --> 00:33:44.103]  And you're going to the Copenhagen Summit on Greenhouse Gases.
[00:33:44.103 --> 00:33:45.924]  What's your objective there?
[00:33:45.924 --> 00:34:03.729]  My objective at Copenhagen will be to say to the leading delegations there, in particular the Americans, the Canadians, the Japanese, the Australians, the New Zealanders, I shan't bother with Europe because that is decided by commissars whom we don't elect, can't hold to account, can't remove and can't persuade.
[00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:07.012]  We are no longer a democracy in Western Europe.
[00:34:07.012 --> 00:34:15.099]  But I'm going to be talking to the delegations of the democracies, and I'm going to be saying to them, one by one, very quietly, first of all, here's the science.
[00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:21.425]  It no longer adds up, and everybody knows it no longer adds up, and your voters now know it no longer adds up.
[00:34:21.786 --> 00:34:35.672]  We're moving away from that now, and we're moving towards a world in which, once again, the scepticism, which is the proper approach of the scientist, is becoming instinct in the ordinary voter's mind.
[00:34:35.672 --> 00:34:37.473]  Will you be talking to the Russians?
[00:34:37.473 --> 00:34:47.357]  Yes, I will, because although the present Russian leadership has had not always a very kindly press in Britain,
[00:34:48.894 --> 00:35:00.836]  I will tell you this, the Russian democracy, as it now is, is 20 times more democratic than the British democracy has become.
[00:35:00.836 --> 00:35:14.839]  Because we now have 90% of our laws made for us by commissars, that is the official German word for the commissioners of the European Union, whom we don't elect, can't question, can't remove and can't replace.
[00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:17.900]  They make 90% of the laws of Britain.
[00:35:18.556 --> 00:35:25.420]  But you have a Duma, you have a Parliament in Russia, which makes 100% of Russia's laws.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.421]  You are now a true democracy.
[00:35:28.421 --> 00:35:29.662]  God bless you for it.
[00:35:29.662 --> 00:35:36.105]  Of course I'll be talking to your delegation, because I will be talking to the delegation of a democratic administration.
[00:35:36.105 --> 00:35:37.926]  We no longer have one.
[00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:40.167]  I shall not be bothering to talk to the British delegation.
[00:35:45.245 --> 00:35:47.068]  And that is the bottom line.
[00:35:47.068 --> 00:36:00.829]  Under the Lisbon Treaty and other treaties, under EU expansion, an unelected group of bureaucrats rule the 25 member nations of the EU, including England, who has never been allowed to have a vote.
[00:36:03.496 --> 00:36:08.738]  Scotland and England have never been allowed to even have a vote on whether they want to be under its control.
[00:36:08.738 --> 00:36:10.978]  They have just gone under its control.
[00:36:10.978 --> 00:36:14.879]  Laws against free speech, environmental laws, and taxes.
[00:36:14.879 --> 00:36:18.120]  Total control.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.582]  And when you read the Club of Rome documents, when you read the statements,
[00:36:23.427 --> 00:36:23.607]  That's
[00:36:40.737 --> 00:36:42.739]  I always call him Herman Von Rumpy.
[00:36:42.739 --> 00:36:45.701]  It's Von Rumpooey is how it's actually pronounced.
[00:36:45.701 --> 00:36:46.982]  Utterly ridiculous.
[00:36:46.982 --> 00:36:48.863]  Sorry if your name happens to be Rumpooey.
[00:36:48.863 --> 00:36:51.906]  It just doesn't roll off the tongue too well.
[00:36:51.906 --> 00:36:54.488]  They are saying that this will be a global Europe.
[00:36:54.488 --> 00:36:58.571]  That the European Union is the center of the spoke.
[00:36:58.571 --> 00:36:59.692]  The core.
[00:36:59.692 --> 00:37:07.658]  That the big-moneyed Rothschild and other interests, the Saxe-Coburg-Guthas of England and of Europe,
[00:37:08.703 --> 00:37:10.005]  They are the dominant force.
[00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:12.048]  They loaned the money to JP Morgan.
[00:37:12.048 --> 00:37:13.991]  When he died, it came out in mainstream newspapers.
[00:37:13.991 --> 00:37:16.394]  He was a British slash European agent.
[00:37:16.394 --> 00:37:18.557]  They loaned the money to the Rockefellers.
[00:37:18.557 --> 00:37:21.842]  They loaned all the money to set up
[00:37:23.433 --> 00:37:26.755]  The robber baron, blue blood elite of the United States.
[00:37:26.755 --> 00:37:29.456]  They had tried to take us over again in 1776.
[00:37:29.456 --> 00:37:40.281]  They tried to finance the South in the 1830s to overthrow Jackson, but because he was a southerner from South Carolina and then Tennessee, he was able to beat it.
[00:37:40.281 --> 00:37:43.842]  They then funded the South again, trying to break up the United States.
[00:37:43.842 --> 00:37:46.043]  And I'm not taking sides on the North and South.
[00:37:46.043 --> 00:37:49.665]  My entire family was on the South and colonels and generals and
[00:37:50.385 --> 00:37:57.370]  They were being abused by the North, so the British came in and manipulated that to try to break up the country, but failed again.
[00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:02.193]  This is imperial divide and conquer that we're dealing with.
[00:38:02.193 --> 00:38:08.177]  And when you talk about the British, they are a royal house out of Europe.
[00:38:08.177 --> 00:38:16.563]  And you read in the Treaty of Rome, 1957, that they planned a European Union that would then take over the planet.
[00:38:18.049 --> 00:38:20.294]  And they discuss how Hitler did it wrong.
[00:38:22.882 --> 00:38:25.483]  Using force, that it needed to be done by stealth.
[00:38:25.483 --> 00:38:37.288]  And we see that again and again in the latest documents that have been released via FOIA request and lawsuits in Canada, the US, England, and the continent of Europe, that it's all being done by stealth.
[00:38:37.288 --> 00:38:44.731]  Now, in 1998, when George Bush was running for re-election as governor, I went to a press conference.
[00:38:44.731 --> 00:38:46.712]  He'd been given the same speech over and over again.
[00:38:46.712 --> 00:38:48.312]  They had said he would take questions.
[00:38:48.312 --> 00:38:49.873]  Then they announced he wouldn't take questions.
[00:38:49.873 --> 00:38:51.253]  He gave the speech.
[00:38:51.253 --> 00:38:52.254]  At the end of his speech,
[00:38:54.209 --> 00:38:56.511]  Because his speech was online when it was the end of the speech.
[00:38:56.511 --> 00:38:57.472]  I asked the question.
[00:38:57.472 --> 00:39:01.235]  I said, if you care about Texas so much, what about the CFR?
[00:39:01.235 --> 00:39:05.098]  What about Europe taking over America through the private Federal Reserve?
[00:39:05.098 --> 00:39:13.965]  I knew it was that banking system getting everyone in debt, getting the states in debt to implode us through derivatives as they've done in third world countries over and over again.
[00:39:14.525 --> 00:39:27.270]  Then in March of 2002, over a thousand pages of secret IMF and World Bank documents got leaked to Greg Pallast of BBC, stating they were planning it in the next eight years in Europe and the U.S.
[00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:35.994]  to bankrupt us just like Argentina, to bankrupt us just like African countries and Asian countries.
[00:39:35.994 --> 00:39:38.075]  Nigeria is one of the best examples.
[00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:40.096]  We know their game plan.
[00:39:40.096 --> 00:39:42.037]  That's how we're able to lay all this out.
[00:39:42.972 --> 00:39:45.913]  Again, I use the parable of the TV Guide.
[00:39:45.913 --> 00:40:05.537]  If I come home and tell my wife at 5 o'clock when we're eating dinner on Monday night, hey honey, the Bengals are going to be playing the Cowboys tonight, and then the Bengals and the Cowboys come on at 7, 8 o'clock at night for an NFL game, she doesn't say, my gosh, honey, you've got psychic powers, how did you know this?
[00:40:05.537 --> 00:40:08.518]  No, it's the TV Guide.
[00:40:08.518 --> 00:40:11.239]  They told us what they would do!
[00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:12.079]  It's public!
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.901]  It's public!
[00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:16.982]  They're going to bankrupt everything.
[00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:18.363]  They want you to riot.
[00:40:18.363 --> 00:40:25.686]  They're then going to turn regular army and paramilitary troops loose on you to sell the idea that we have to have martial law.
[00:40:25.686 --> 00:40:30.088]  They won't call it martial law, they'll call it security crackdown.
[00:40:30.088 --> 00:40:32.950]  They're going to take over everything.
[00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.131]  This is a hot takeover they're getting ready for.
[00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:38.548]  Not a cold war against freedom.
[00:40:38.548 --> 00:40:41.209]  War is being declared on humanity.
[00:40:41.209 --> 00:40:43.310]  World government is here.
[00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.011]  Do I need to play Al Gore?
[00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:46.932]  Do I need to play Van Rompuy?
[00:40:46.932 --> 00:40:51.054]  Do I need to play Ban Ki-moon saying world government?
[00:40:51.054 --> 00:40:56.656]  Do I need to play the President Obama saying global governance?
[00:40:56.656 --> 00:40:59.737]  Do I need to play these clips again?
[00:40:59.737 --> 00:41:00.618]  You've all heard them!
[00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:08.226]  Or if your neighbors or friends haven't, get the film, Follow the Republic, where they're on video saying it.
[00:41:08.226 --> 00:41:11.008]  We need to warn people now!
[00:41:11.008 --> 00:41:12.749]  We're being politically conquered.
[00:41:12.749 --> 00:41:21.855]  This is a economic, political, corporate coup of every sovereign nation, and these people are Nazi eugenicists.
[00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:23.016]  And I use the term Nazi.
[00:41:23.016 --> 00:41:24.177]  They're not really Nazis.
[00:41:24.177 --> 00:41:27.379]  That's just one flavor of one spinoff group of these people.
[00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:41.130]  Hitler learned everything he did from England and the U.S., and this is a more liberal version of that, where they say, we're going to sterilize and kill everybody.
[00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.390]  Do you understand?
[00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.931]  This is the only issue.
[00:41:43.931 --> 00:41:45.071]  This is the issue.
[00:41:45.071 --> 00:41:47.872]  This is everything happening now.
[00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:49.472]  Now, here I am 11 years ago.
[00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.591]  Having my arm almost twisted off my back.
[00:41:55.591 --> 00:41:59.673]  They grabbed it, twisted it all the way up to the top of my back.
[00:41:59.673 --> 00:42:13.597]  To this day, my shoulder rotator cuff is ripped from this, and if I roll over at night wrong, shooting pain goes through me for simply asking a question and saying, isn't it Europe that's taking us over?
[00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:16.418]  And now, what is happening?
[00:42:16.418 --> 00:42:17.759]  This is the Antichrist
[00:42:18.575 --> 00:42:21.156]  This is going to be an endorsement of a philosophy.
[00:42:41.914 --> 00:42:46.897]  I believe in my heart of hearts the victory in 1998 is going to be good for Texas.
[00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:50.019]  And that's the most important thing about the campaign.
[00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:50.680]  Wouldn't it?
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.882]  Sir, shouldn't we abolish the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[00:42:53.882 --> 00:42:55.923]  That's the real reality that none of you will talk about.
[00:42:55.923 --> 00:42:57.544]  Most of you are members.
[00:42:57.544 --> 00:43:01.407]  That's what's destroying this country, Governor.
[00:43:01.407 --> 00:43:03.468]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[00:43:03.468 --> 00:43:06.771]  What about the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:08.051]  You people are being lied to.
[00:43:08.051 --> 00:43:09.973]  This country's been taken over by Europe.
[00:43:09.973 --> 00:43:10.973]  And I'm being drugged out.
[00:43:10.973 --> 00:43:11.514]  Laugh at it!
[00:43:20.374 --> 00:43:25.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you can if you want to watch that video, it's all over the web.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.986]  Just Google Alex Jones gets arrested for asking George W. Bush a question.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:41.545]  Again, how did I know 11 years ago, 11 years ago, what the threat was?
[00:43:41.545 --> 00:43:44.888]  The private banking dictatorship controlled by Europe.
[00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:50.392]  Because I read their own documents.
[00:43:50.392 --> 00:43:59.998]  But now they're openly establishing the world dictatorship so they have to admit what they're doing but put a spin on it like they're doing it to help everyone.
[00:43:59.998 --> 00:44:02.020]  If you will simply warn everyone you know
[00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.895]  This can be stopped.
[00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:09.890]  And I want to tell the bureaucrats, the enforcers, the corporate minions, the police, something.
[00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:33.294]  When you go along with this system, when you violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, when you hunt the American people, when you think of us as animals, when you're conditioned by television and movies that beating us and tasering us is cute and funny, when you are trained to snatch people's children with no due process, when you are trained to forcibly inoculate the population,
[00:44:33.934 --> 00:44:39.778]  You are siding with the greatest evil ever manifested on this planet.
[00:44:39.778 --> 00:44:42.920]  I know most of you are good men and women that serve this system.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.721]  You're compartmentalized.
[00:44:44.721 --> 00:44:52.206]  And you need to understand the true cost of what we are facing as a society and as a planet.
[00:44:52.206 --> 00:45:01.652]  You need to know and to be told and to be reminded that there is an important choice that you need to make.
[00:45:05.456 --> 00:45:11.600]  Everyone listening to my voice must call every talk show they can about the global government takeover.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.723]  You've got to call every talk show you can about what taxing carbon dioxide will do.
[00:45:16.723 --> 00:45:18.624]  You've got to call everyone you know.
[00:45:18.624 --> 00:45:23.407]  You've got to call Congress and tell them, do not ratify this treaty in the U.S.
[00:45:23.407 --> 00:45:25.208]  Senate.
[00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:30.211]  Do not pass the government takeover of health care that gives these eugenicists control over our lives.
[00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.312]  They want you dependent on them.
[00:45:32.543 --> 00:45:39.212]  Do not let them legalize all the illegals and open the borders up for the North American Union to further bankrupt the states.
[00:45:39.212 --> 00:45:41.715]  That's starting now in Congress.
[00:45:41.715 --> 00:45:43.618]  We have got to take our states back.
[00:45:43.618 --> 00:45:45.540]  We've got to educate our legislatures.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.561]  We've got to have the states
[00:45:47.648 --> 00:45:52.993]  Declare their 9th and 10th Amendment just powers over the rogue federal government.
[00:45:52.993 --> 00:45:55.655]  We have to just chant with one voice.
[00:45:55.655 --> 00:45:56.856]  The government is criminal.
[00:45:56.856 --> 00:45:58.257]  The government is illegal.
[00:45:58.257 --> 00:46:01.760]  The government has been hijacked by foreign corporate interests.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:11.488]  We must get that word out on every hill and mountain and every valley and never stop because the people are now ready to hear the truth.
[00:46:11.488 --> 00:46:14.751]  The people are now ready to awaken.
[00:46:15.191 --> 00:46:17.093]  The people were stalled.
[00:46:17.093 --> 00:46:18.435]  The people were hamstrung.
[00:46:18.435 --> 00:46:19.636]  They were lied to.
[00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:21.478]  They were told there is no carbon tax.
[00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:23.019]  There is no global government.
[00:46:23.019 --> 00:46:24.781]  There is no UN takeover.
[00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:28.805]  There is no plan to bankrupt the banks, to bankrupt the country.
[00:46:28.805 --> 00:46:29.866]  There is no plan.
[00:46:29.866 --> 00:46:31.948]  There is no private Federal Reserve.
[00:46:31.948 --> 00:46:33.530]  There is no UN takeover.
[00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.452]  There is no North American Union.
[00:46:35.452 --> 00:46:37.174]  There is no NAFTA superhighway.
[00:46:38.502 --> 00:46:50.390]  Just three years ago, CNN would do newscasts saying there's no such thing as a trans-Texas corridor and NAFTA superhighways, even as the federal government announced it and put up billboards.
[00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:54.213]  But the flat-out lying... I mean, how dumb do they think you are?
[00:46:54.213 --> 00:46:55.774]  How dumb do they think we are?
[00:46:55.774 --> 00:47:02.899]  To sit there and tell you there's no North American Union when they officially signed the treaty in 2005.
[00:47:02.899 --> 00:47:06.982]  How dumb do they think you are to tell you there's no global government being set up?
[00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:12.133]  How stupid do they think you are?
[00:47:12.133 --> 00:47:14.477]  I see cars all over Austin.
[00:47:16.823 --> 00:47:20.044]  Driving around with bumper stickers saying TerraPass.
[00:47:20.044 --> 00:47:21.504]  And that's what the global government says.
[00:47:21.504 --> 00:47:28.225]  You're going to have an ID card through your national system that tracks all the gas you buy, all the food you buy, everything you buy.
[00:47:28.225 --> 00:47:31.586]  And when your carbon credits run out, the taxes only increase.
[00:47:31.586 --> 00:47:34.147]  Every item you buy will already have taxes on it.
[00:47:34.147 --> 00:47:37.187]  Home inspections, no privacy, total control.
[00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:42.448]  Open UN documents about how they're brainwashing all your kids in the schools.
[00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:44.669]  As if we needed those secret documents to know that.
[00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:45.849]  We see it manifesting.
[00:47:48.203 --> 00:47:50.884]  And I see these cars driving along that say TerraPass.
[00:47:50.884 --> 00:47:55.045]  I took a photo of one last Friday.
[00:47:55.045 --> 00:47:59.646]  When we go live on TV later, I'm going to show it to the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:47:59.646 --> 00:48:03.287]  You will not find better transparency than a TerraPass.
[00:48:03.287 --> 00:48:04.608]  See, it's all about transparency.
[00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:10.799]  And you go and buy these from them, and then it says, measure your energy usage.
[00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:12.840]  And now they have TV shows in the U.S.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:34.915]  called Climate Cops, where people go around and make it fashionable and cool, and, oh, it saves you money, and own electric cars and windmills, all these things that sound reasonable, when at the core, it's a police state tracking grid to further bankrupt all the poor families in the country, and then you're gonna have CPS assessments, and when you're poor, they're gonna take your children!
[00:48:35.795 --> 00:48:37.696]  That's in eco-science.
[00:48:37.696 --> 00:48:45.558]  Eco-science that I talk about every hour is an 1,100 page blueprint of everything they're carrying out.
[00:48:45.558 --> 00:48:54.640]  Your water supply is having over 150 chemicals added, every one of them known to sterilize mammals.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.962]  It's so deadly, it's sterilizing the fish and amphibians, the frogs and the salamanders.
[00:49:01.977 --> 00:49:03.598]  Dallas, Texas.
[00:49:03.598 --> 00:49:05.100]  Denver, Colorado.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:13.948]  Associated Press has reported they found levels of serotonin reuptake inhibitors hundreds of times higher than what could have been caused by sewage runoff.
[00:49:13.948 --> 00:49:22.976]  They're adding it to the water and the Japanese government and the British government have proposed, I have the CNBC newscast, openly putting Prozac in the water.
[00:49:23.576 --> 00:49:25.598]  These people don't play games!
[00:49:25.598 --> 00:49:30.421]  Your water supply is... Listen to me, you little stupid cops that are on power trips!
[00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:33.584]  You think you've got power over the people been given to you by the Beast?
[00:49:33.584 --> 00:49:34.765]  To make war on us?
[00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:35.906]  Listen to me, fools!
[00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:37.967]  You're having your water spiked!
[00:49:37.967 --> 00:49:39.389]  You like being effeminate?
[00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:41.090]  You like getting bone cancer?
[00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:44.773]  You like your kids dying?
[00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:45.533]  You listen to me!
[00:49:46.823 --> 00:49:51.286]  You're not a real man until you face the horror, and I know it takes a lot to admit.
[00:49:51.286 --> 00:49:59.290]  We got a psycho murder government running this society that's spiking your water.
[00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.171]  This isn't a game.
[00:50:01.171 --> 00:50:02.952]  This isn't a joke.
[00:50:02.952 --> 00:50:04.993]  This isn't a drill.
[00:50:04.993 --> 00:50:15.500]  You're living in a 21st century Charlie Manson, Buck Rogers, carnal house of charnel, death, and blood.
[00:50:16.516 --> 00:50:19.597]  You're being soft-killed!
[00:50:19.597 --> 00:50:22.759]  All you Dudley do-rights giving petty power by the system.
[00:50:22.759 --> 00:50:23.979]  You think you're doing good.
[00:50:23.979 --> 00:50:25.520]  You think the system's good.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.480]  Just look around you.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.342]  It's rotten, stinking death.
[00:50:29.342 --> 00:50:40.627]  Society's just rotting and falling apart as they cut off the money, as they cut off the resources, as unemployment surges past 20% nationwide and 30% in California.
[00:50:40.627 --> 00:50:43.388]  As the stinking media lies and tells you everything's great.
[00:50:44.537 --> 00:50:45.378]  You want evil?
[00:50:45.378 --> 00:50:46.660]  You think evil's cute?
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.523]  You think black uniforms are cute?
[00:50:48.523 --> 00:50:51.447]  You're gonna find out how cute evil is!
[00:50:51.447 --> 00:50:55.693]  All of you people that serve darkness are gonna be run over by your own system!
[00:50:55.693 --> 00:50:58.737]  You're gonna be fed head first into a meat grinder!
[00:50:58.737 --> 00:50:59.919]  A garbage disposal!
[00:51:00.299 --> 00:51:03.460]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.081]  Need alternatives to conventional food preparation?
[00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:08.681]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[00:51:08.681 --> 00:51:11.022]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?

[00:52:10.859 --> 00:52:13.560]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:19.921]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.921 --> 00:52:25.103]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.103 --> 00:52:28.383]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:52:28.383 --> 00:52:35.105]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.225 --> 00:52:37.566]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.566 --> 00:52:39.147]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.147 --> 00:52:41.609]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.609 --> 00:52:43.730]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:48.894]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.894 --> 00:52:57.999]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:53:01.948 --> 00:53:05.191]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[00:53:05.191 --> 00:53:07.073]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[00:53:07.073 --> 00:53:09.595]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?

[00:53:41.898 --> 00:53:42.638]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.672 --> 00:54:26.897]  We have a criminal, illegitimate, fraud government staging terror attacks as a pretext to set up a control grid.
[00:54:26.897 --> 00:54:32.400]  They openly arrest people, hold them for eight years under torture, including torturing their children.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.441]  That's admitted.
[00:54:33.441 --> 00:54:36.142]  And then they trot them out for a fake trial in New York.
[00:54:37.884 --> 00:54:41.566]  I've got a guest, the webmaster for Cryptome.org coming on.
[00:54:41.566 --> 00:54:51.910]  He's being threatened with suit by Yahoo because he got their internal documents where, without warrants, they just give police whatever data they want.
[00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:53.931]  Your emails, your instant messages, everything.
[00:54:53.931 --> 00:54:55.051]  And that's par for the course.
[00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:56.492]  It's been going on for a long time.
[00:54:59.844 --> 00:55:01.764]  Just total police state.
[00:55:01.764 --> 00:55:13.867]  And all these little thugs that work for the system think they're doing it for the good, while DynCorp and Halliburton publicly, in mainstream newspapers, run giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:55:13.867 --> 00:55:16.227]  These people are unbelievable.
[00:55:16.227 --> 00:55:17.807]  Total evil.
[00:55:17.807 --> 00:55:24.669]  And all you Dudley Do-Rights that serve the system and violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution like it's a religion.
[00:55:24.669 --> 00:55:27.069]  Yeah, it's a religion, the religion of hell and tyranny.
[00:55:29.585 --> 00:55:40.940]  You have no idea, no idea what you're part of, no idea what you've conjured, no idea what you've brought forward, and what is manifesting itself right now upon the planet.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:47.149]  Something that will make Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, and every other dictator look like child's play.
[00:55:49.358 --> 00:55:51.320]  EPA sets carbon crackdown.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.262]  New York Times to announce carbon dioxide is a toxic waste.
[00:55:55.262 --> 00:55:55.883]  Tax it.
[00:55:55.883 --> 00:55:56.323]  Ban it.
[00:55:56.323 --> 00:55:57.124]  Eliminate it.
[00:55:57.124 --> 00:55:58.845]  What do you think you exhale?
[00:55:58.845 --> 00:55:59.946]  Club of Rome.
[00:55:59.946 --> 00:56:01.827]  Statements.
[00:56:01.827 --> 00:56:02.207]  1992.
[00:56:02.207 --> 00:56:04.209]  United Nations speech.
[00:56:04.209 --> 00:56:10.874]  Head of the UN Environment Program, Maurice Strong, said it is our job to destroy industrial society.
[00:56:10.874 --> 00:56:15.357]  We will do this by taxing and then finally eliminating carbon dioxide.
[00:56:15.357 --> 00:56:16.398]  That you exhale
[00:56:19.437 --> 00:56:24.938]  And these fools drive around in their cars with their little TerraPasses.
[00:56:24.938 --> 00:56:28.619]  Oh, I pay my carbon indulgences to Al Gore.
[00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:30.279]  I send money to Al Gore.
[00:56:30.279 --> 00:56:32.039]  He will save the Earth.
[00:56:32.039 --> 00:56:35.580]  Yeah, when his World Bank isn't clear-cutting the rainforest.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:45.702]  The very globalists that push all this environmentalism are slaughtering whole species and burning down forests and dumping toxic waste in the ocean so fast it'll make your head spin.
[00:56:46.582 --> 00:56:50.706]  The oil companies publicly, openly run the carbon tax.
[00:56:50.706 --> 00:57:01.096]  The insurance companies openly wrote the government takeover of health care bill and are slashing Medicare and Medicaid over 41 billion dollars a year with glee.
[00:57:01.096 --> 00:57:05.100]  The left hails and has huge Newsweek covers.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.621]  The case for killing Granny.
[00:57:07.262 --> 00:57:12.849]  ABC News reports on how children are being taught that committing suicide is good for the earth.
[00:57:12.849 --> 00:57:16.494]  You cannot make up the sickening evil going on.
[00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:31.376]  I'm going to break down the latest on ClimateGate, the latest on Copenhagen, but first I'm going to take your calls on Copenhagen, on the economy, on the police state, on all these giant stacks of key news I've got.

[00:58:38.513 --> 00:58:39.034]  Stay with us!
[00:58:40.588 --> 00:58:46.221]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.221 --> 00:58:49.429]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.646 --> 00:58:53.648]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.648 --> 00:58:58.992]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:58.992 --> 00:59:01.033]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.033 --> 00:59:06.036]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.036 --> 00:59:07.217]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.217 --> 00:59:08.338]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.338 --> 00:59:10.219]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:11.300]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.501]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.501 --> 00:59:14.842]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:14.842 --> 00:59:16.163]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.363 --> 00:59:21.627]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.627 --> 00:59:25.209]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.209 --> 00:59:29.032]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.252]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.252 --> 00:59:31.153]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.153 --> 00:59:32.254]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.254 --> 00:59:33.014]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.014 --> 00:59:33.995]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.275 --> 00:59:37.336]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.336 --> 00:59:39.537]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.537 --> 00:59:40.537]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.537 --> 00:59:41.697]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:41.697 --> 00:59:43.558]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:05.361]  We have the
[01:00:35.495 --> 01:00:50.784]  Webmaster John Young from Cryptome.org joining us in the last hour today to look at how corporations and government are spying on the American people.
[01:00:50.784 --> 01:00:56.987]  Yahoo threatens Cryptome over leaked surveillance document.
[01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.049]  You want to know how bad the surveillance is?
[01:00:59.049 --> 01:01:00.570]  There was a, in 2002, one article
[01:01:04.284 --> 01:01:09.767]  In USA Today called scofflaws caught while ordering pizza.
[01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:19.792]  And it talked about how the federal government with private corporations has set up a one digital clearinghouse in Dallas that all the major pizza chains filter your names through.
[01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:25.955]  And when you call up with your name and number and credit card, your crime history is run.
[01:01:25.955 --> 01:01:29.997]  And if you have any warrants out, they then identify where your address is.
[01:01:29.997 --> 01:01:33.179]  You may get SWAT teamed that day, or they may show up a week later.
[01:01:34.577 --> 01:01:40.662]  And then the companies, the pizza places, get 25% of any fines or fees.
[01:01:40.662 --> 01:01:51.111]  A lot of carpet cleaners and telephone repair people, plumbers, make more money off ratting on you and tattling on you and spying on you.
[01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:52.171]  See, there's a whole web
[01:01:53.132 --> 01:02:01.197]  of surveillance and they're now flipping it from drug surveillance to gun surveillance and patriot surveillance as political police.
[01:02:01.197 --> 01:02:04.058]  Children are being trained to write dossiers on their parents.
[01:02:04.058 --> 01:02:07.641]  The New York Times writes articles about how great it is.
[01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:14.265]  I'm going to break that down in the last hour today with these new huge developments with Yahoo.
[01:02:14.265 --> 01:02:17.947]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for that.
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.321]  We're also, of course, going to take your phone calls.
[01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.282]  I'm going to go to those now.
[01:02:22.282 --> 01:02:30.745]  At the bottom of the hour, I will blitz through all the latest ClimateGate news and the EPA announcing carbon dioxide as a deadly chemical.
[01:02:30.745 --> 01:02:36.988]  Total, complete lies, but we'll break down this declaration of war against life by the eugenicist.
[01:02:36.988 --> 01:02:40.369]  Bill in Colorado, your first caller of the day.
[01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:41.470]  Welcome.
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:42.891]  Hi, good morning.
[01:02:42.891 --> 01:02:48.193]  Yesterday, a few friends of mine and I, we attended a gun show here in Denver, Colorado.
[01:02:49.122 --> 01:02:52.724]  And we were one of the first eight or ten in line.
[01:02:52.724 --> 01:02:59.648]  And it was my turn to treat, so I bought the three tickets and paid for them, and they stamped our hand.
[01:02:59.648 --> 01:03:09.214]  And as we turned to go in, there were two women standing there with books, and they demanded our last four digits for our Social Security numbers.
[01:03:10.595 --> 01:03:20.367]  Yes, the Feds are paying and the BATF threatens gun shows through racketeering and intimidation to get photos of people.
[01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:22.289]  Most big gun shows have hidden cameras on them.
[01:03:22.289 --> 01:03:23.851]  That's come out in the news.
[01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:27.815]  Celica Stillo in Texas exposed that, so they put him in prison, set him up.
[01:03:28.416 --> 01:03:29.216]  Denver, Colorado.
[01:03:29.216 --> 01:03:30.217]  I don't know the name of the show.
[01:03:30.217 --> 01:03:31.478]  I'm sorry, I couldn't remember it.
[01:03:57.731 --> 01:04:03.335]  But it's one of those ones that's here every other month in Denver.
[01:04:03.335 --> 01:04:05.756]  You need to look it up online and tell us.
[01:04:05.756 --> 01:04:07.197]  Where was it being held?
[01:04:07.197 --> 01:04:11.000]  Where was it being held?
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.723]  I believe it was behind... I don't want to mention the name of the hotel.
[01:04:15.723 --> 01:04:16.644]  Why not?
[01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:17.885]  Why not expose the people?
[01:04:17.885 --> 01:04:19.546]  Why not give the location?
[01:04:19.546 --> 01:04:21.687]  I think it was the Howard Johnson's.
[01:04:21.687 --> 01:04:25.250]  Okay, so it's... and is it a government rec center?
[01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.650]  What is it?
[01:04:26.832 --> 01:04:30.715]  It's a big recreation center that the gun shows rent.
[01:04:30.715 --> 01:04:44.144]  The other thing that was surprising, we found four teams of two each, federal agents, checking every table for certain types of weapons to see if they had the fully automatic switch on them.
[01:04:44.144 --> 01:04:51.529]  And these guys were running through that show like they were on roller skates.
[01:04:51.529 --> 01:04:53.770]  Was it the Tanner gun show?
[01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:54.751]  Yes sir, that was it.
[01:04:55.774 --> 01:04:56.174]  Stay there.
[01:04:56.174 --> 01:04:58.715]  We need a full report on the other side.
[01:04:58.715 --> 01:04:59.075]  Stay there.
[01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:00.015]  Don't hang up, Bill.
[01:05:00.015 --> 01:05:05.317]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.317 --> 01:05:09.838]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:09.838 --> 01:05:12.119]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.119 --> 01:05:13.740]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.780]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:23.446]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:09.023]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:06:59.738 --> 01:07:04.301]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.301 --> 01:07:05.201]  Number one.
[01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:08.624]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:09.484]  Number two.
[01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:14.387]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.387 --> 01:07:15.128]  It's true.
[01:07:15.128 --> 01:07:19.991]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:20.531]  Number three.
[01:07:20.811 --> 01:07:24.394]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.394 --> 01:07:29.118]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:31.880]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.222]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:40.485]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.485 --> 01:07:45.528]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:49.710]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:51.491]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:56.093]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:05.365 --> 01:08:06.666]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.447]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.447 --> 01:08:10.208]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:11.789]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:13.330]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:17.532]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.532 --> 01:08:25.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:28.379]  We are investigating this right now.
[01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:42.851]  I am calling the Tanner Gun Show, which is a big regional show, travels around the country, like most gun shows do.
[01:08:42.851 --> 01:08:45.832]  We are calling to confirm if what Bill is saying is accurate.
[01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:52.173]  Now, I believe his tone, I've talked to a million callers, but sometimes people make mistakes.
[01:08:52.173 --> 01:08:59.694]  The reason, preliminarily, I believe it, is because I'm already aware of this happening in some gun shows in Texas.
[01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:09.609]  And what they do is, over the years, they get gun shows on one or two little violations of BATF code, most of the time made up.
[01:09:11.021 --> 01:09:16.643]  Then they intimidate them and say, look, if you work with us, we'll leave you alone.
[01:09:16.643 --> 01:09:18.803]  And they mount hidden cameras all over.
[01:09:18.803 --> 01:09:22.525]  They'll have BATF up in the ceiling or on the second floor.
[01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:26.006]  Or they'll have a walled off area with wall separators.
[01:09:26.006 --> 01:09:32.668]  And the BATF, FBI, federal marshals, state police groups are all there surveilling everyone.
[01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:39.946]  And an old man will come in, sell his deer rifle, walk out, they'll arrest him in the parking lot and charge him as a gun dealer.
[01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:45.590]  It doesn't matter if it's legal to privately transfer firearms.
[01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:49.853]  When you do the NICS system, you are instantly registered as a gun owner.
[01:09:50.663 --> 01:09:55.567]  And the gun shops always love to say, oh no, we're not registering people because they don't want to scare folks off.
[01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:57.248]  But you are being registered.
[01:09:57.248 --> 01:10:05.815]  And I always explain that they would then, without a judge, without a jury, without a conviction, just say, oh, well, you can't own a gun now because you're a person of interest.
[01:10:05.815 --> 01:10:07.357]  You're on the Homeland Security list.
[01:10:07.357 --> 01:10:08.798]  I said this before we had Homeland Security.
[01:10:09.932 --> 01:10:15.296]  Now they have the no-fly, no-buy bill in the House, but they don't care if the bill hadn't passed.
[01:10:15.296 --> 01:10:22.482]  All over the country, veterans, people with no criminal record, are going in to buy guns and said, sorry, Homeland Security's got you on the list.
[01:10:22.482 --> 01:10:28.007]  People that are suddenly on the no-fly, over 1,200,000 since they made it secret a year ago.
[01:10:28.007 --> 01:10:29.968]  They were adding 25,000 names a month.
[01:10:29.968 --> 01:10:33.411]  Federal marshals came out and said they were ordered to put innocent people on the list.
[01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:34.532]  They had a quota.
[01:10:34.532 --> 01:10:36.554]  No judge, no jury, you're just on a secret list.
[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:47.417]  We also know that Schwarzenegger got a law passed where you've got to be registered, thumbprinted, to buy ammo.
[01:10:47.417 --> 01:10:49.459]  Ammo has to be behind the counter.
[01:10:49.459 --> 01:10:53.342]  Here in Texas, I've talked to one of my great-uncles.
[01:10:53.342 --> 01:10:54.763]  I've also talked to one of my cousins.
[01:10:54.763 --> 01:10:59.306]  I haven't been in Walmart to buy ammo or guns in years, so I don't know.
[01:10:59.306 --> 01:11:01.048]  But Walmart nationwide
[01:11:02.947 --> 01:11:03.107]  I don't
[01:11:21.812 --> 01:11:23.773]  It's being done extra judicially.
[01:11:23.773 --> 01:11:26.115]  It's just random color of law.
[01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.616]  It's criminal.
[01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.337]  There should be congressional investigations.
[01:11:29.337 --> 01:11:31.178]  The BATF should be in trouble.
[01:11:31.178 --> 01:11:35.581]  Where are the supposed Second Amendment lobbies?
[01:11:35.581 --> 01:11:41.465]  All over the nation, realtors, anyone that comes in your house, are being paid.
[01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:42.685]  The companies are being paid.
[01:11:42.685 --> 01:11:44.887]  The big realty companies, the plumbers,
[01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:49.286]  The construction companies to spy.
[01:11:49.286 --> 01:11:50.786]  And this has come out in the news.
[01:11:50.786 --> 01:11:52.206]  What kind of guns do you have?
[01:11:52.206 --> 01:11:53.906]  Is there a gun case?
[01:11:53.906 --> 01:11:54.987]  What do they look like?
[01:11:54.987 --> 01:11:58.287]  Try to take a photo with your iPhone if you can.
[01:11:58.287 --> 01:11:59.968]  Doesn't matter if you think it's legal.
[01:11:59.968 --> 01:12:02.408]  Go ahead and call the local police.
[01:12:02.408 --> 01:12:03.908]  They've got an intelligence bureau.
[01:12:03.908 --> 01:12:06.149]  They file a lot of big cities.
[01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:11.090]  The plumbers get basically a smaller check.
[01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:13.070]  The people that are in your house get a smaller check.
[01:12:14.574 --> 01:12:16.176]  Just for the reports.
[01:12:16.176 --> 01:12:26.346]  And so a lot of cities, you go online and they file these reports, a giant secret police archipelago that makes East Germany look tame.
[01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:31.891]  It's just everywhere, a total grid of un-American crime.
[01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:35.995]  And they're going through the documents for the site right now.
[01:12:35.995 --> 01:12:37.397]  But according to Bill,
[01:12:39.033 --> 01:12:44.196]  The Tanner Gun Show asked for the last four digits of their social security number.
[01:12:44.196 --> 01:12:51.301]  Now I get call after call after call after call about people having to have their driver's license copied or their social security number.
[01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:53.542]  But we need to get this documented.
[01:12:53.542 --> 01:12:55.424]  We need more calls on this subject.
[01:12:56.104 --> 01:12:57.486]  The problem is the caller's getting through.
[01:12:57.486 --> 01:13:02.371]  We need more people to send us emails to riders at InfoWars.com and Showtips.
[01:13:02.371 --> 01:13:09.779]  So Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and others, we're on the phone with the gun show right now.
[01:13:09.779 --> 01:13:12.222]  Were you able to get through, Jaren?
[01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:13.703]  No answer.
[01:13:13.703 --> 01:13:13.984]  Busy.
[01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:17.844]  Okay, Bill, I'm going to shut up.
[01:13:17.844 --> 01:13:20.366]  You were in Denver at the Tanner Gun Show.
[01:13:20.366 --> 01:13:28.109]  Specifically, calmly, tell us exactly what happened, what the lady looked like, what she was doing with the numbers.
[01:13:28.109 --> 01:13:32.251]  What happened when you got there and what was happening inside, Bill?
[01:13:32.251 --> 01:13:37.934]  Well, like I said, we walked and we were the first 8 or 10 people.
[01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:40.475]  And being Sunday, we had a snowstorm up here.
[01:13:40.475 --> 01:13:44.237]  There was less than 100 that showed up for the whole show during the day, but anyway,
[01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:57.526]  After we paid our money, and she stamped the back of each one of our hands, we turned to walk in past the table, and there were two ladies standing there with books in their hands.
[01:13:57.526 --> 01:14:02.927]  And the lady says, last four of your Social Security number, please.
[01:14:02.927 --> 01:14:08.509]  And everybody started shouting out their numbers, and they're writing down as fast as they could.
[01:14:08.509 --> 01:14:11.169]  They could, and we walked right on in.
[01:14:11.169 --> 01:14:13.230]  But like I say, we were the first
[01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:19.870]  Peter Tinn in the show, and you could see four teams of two.
[01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:24.551]  And these men were running to certain tables, picking up certain weapons, checking.
[01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:31.173]  So we wanted to have a little fun, so we darted over by this one team.
[01:14:31.173 --> 01:14:35.514]  And he was quickly picking them up, turning them over, checking.
[01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:38.475]  So my buddy, you know, being a clown, he picked one up.
[01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:39.995]  He says, hey Bill, look at this.
[01:14:39.995 --> 01:14:42.016]  It's got a switch on it that says full.
[01:14:42.577 --> 01:14:45.478]  And the guy almost had a heart attack.
[01:14:45.478 --> 01:14:49.219]  Him and his partner turned so fast they almost lost their heads.
[01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:51.860]  And he looked at them and smiled and winked and put it back down.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.661]  He says, have a nice day, kids.
[01:14:54.661 --> 01:14:55.382]  We're older men.
[01:14:55.382 --> 01:14:57.202]  We're close to 70 years old.
[01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:59.483]  But you could tell who these two were.
[01:14:59.483 --> 01:15:01.364]  They were agents.
[01:15:01.364 --> 01:15:04.345]  And the other three teams were running around the room checking.
[01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:11.134]  I don't call them law enforcement officers.
[01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:13.996]  I call them troublemakers.
[01:15:13.996 --> 01:15:28.303]  And I'm very, very surprised to hear what you've been saying about men of my age and ex-military and everything that we're going to be unable to defend our homes and our wives and our grandchildren.
[01:15:28.303 --> 01:15:29.584]  That hurts me immensely.
[01:15:31.786 --> 01:15:39.168]  Well, sir, we have a completely rogue government with spy grids publicly brainwashing the kids.
[01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:44.629]  I have the local Austin training videos where they give the kids 200 bucks to report on their parents.
[01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:49.770]  This is the opposite of freedom, the opposite of the land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:56.352]  But the issue of the social security number and everyone just submitting, but notice how they got your money first.
[01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:56.712]  It's like,
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:05.005]  At Disney World, or at Mall of America, or at SeaWorld.
[01:16:05.005 --> 01:16:13.731]  You go through, you pay your $20, $30, $50, $100, depending on, it might be $85 to get into Disneyland, Disney World.
[01:16:13.731 --> 01:16:22.257]  You pay, and then you walk up and they say, oh, we're going to take a digital photo and a hand scan now, and everyone just submits, like people going into a gas chamber.
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.621]  Knowing you've already paid your money.
[01:16:25.621 --> 01:16:32.164]  Now, I always say no, and then they just let me through saying, yeah, we get some people that don't submit.
[01:16:32.164 --> 01:16:36.326]  But this is the cashless control grid we're being trained for.
[01:16:36.326 --> 01:16:42.829]  And those cops that were in there, they love drinking fluoride and chlorine and mercury and lead that's in the water for their kids.
[01:16:42.829 --> 01:16:45.371]  They love it when their 10-year-old gets leukemia.
[01:16:45.371 --> 01:16:47.772]  They love serving the New World Order.
[01:16:48.052 --> 01:16:51.233]  They love taking the inoculations and trusting the system.
[01:16:51.233 --> 01:16:53.513]  They love hunting the people down.
[01:16:53.513 --> 01:16:59.474]  They love helping the CPS grab a 20-month-old baby as it cries in its mother's arms, ripping it away.
[01:16:59.474 --> 01:17:00.915]  They get off on the power.
[01:17:00.915 --> 01:17:06.816]  I've been at these things when it's happening, and the cops kind of get this demonic look on their face, getting off on it.
[01:17:06.816 --> 01:17:09.376]  Oh, they just love butchering America.
[01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:13.717]  And we need to recognize who these people are and just how evil they are.
[01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:16.258]  And it's just sick
[01:17:17.058 --> 01:17:23.982]  Sick to see this and it just makes me want to vomit.
[01:17:23.982 --> 01:17:30.726]  In fact, I'm going to open our phone system up because the Genesis system is full with Adam, Mike, Zach, and Dan.
[01:17:30.726 --> 01:17:41.853]  Only callers who've had to give driver's license or social security numbers to go to gun shows, only people that this has happened to or people that have gone in Walmart
[01:17:43.271 --> 01:17:43.331]  The
[01:18:05.552 --> 01:18:07.695]  Defrauding people of their privacy.
[01:18:07.695 --> 01:18:09.338]  They're just wicked, wicked people.
[01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:11.381]  I mean, look, here's USA Today.
[01:18:11.381 --> 01:18:15.187]  Missouri tracks scofflaws via pizza delivery databases.
[01:18:15.187 --> 01:18:16.348]  USA Today.
[01:18:16.348 --> 01:18:21.276]  Then you read the article that says all the major pizza places run your background when you get a pizza.
[01:18:21.616 --> 01:18:23.638]  See, to find out your real location.
[01:18:23.638 --> 01:18:26.421]  You're guilty until proven slave.
[01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:27.942]  And then you're all slaves.
[01:18:27.942 --> 01:18:30.004]  And you're here to render to the New World Order.
[01:18:30.004 --> 01:18:35.009]  And you're here to be pumped full of cancer viruses and roll over like a dead hog in the ditch.
[01:18:35.009 --> 01:18:36.290]  Well, not me!
[01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.812]  I know what's going on and I'm angry!
[01:18:38.812 --> 01:18:40.174]  I haven't had my...
[01:18:41.485 --> 01:18:44.568]  Wavos slashed off by the New World Order.
[01:18:44.568 --> 01:18:51.015]  Bill, I need you to write up exactly what happened to you at this gun show, and I need you to give me a call.
[01:18:51.015 --> 01:18:55.019]  I need other people to call me, but I'm going to give out the direct number to my studio, 888-201-2244.
[01:18:55.019 --> 01:18:55.079]  888-201-2244.
[01:18:55.079 --> 01:18:55.119]  888-201-2244.
[01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:07.913]  Because I, you know what, I'm so busy, I should have done this investigation a long time ago.
[01:19:07.913 --> 01:19:10.855]  I know they're doing this, but I just kind of give in to the tyranny.
[01:19:10.855 --> 01:19:13.676]  And don't let it upset me, because I've got a million other balls in the air.
[01:19:13.676 --> 01:19:14.457]  No.
[01:19:14.457 --> 01:19:16.018]  This is a big issue.
[01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:20.380]  And we need to expose it, and have congressional investigations, because this is a fraud.
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.322]  888-201-2244.
[01:19:23.322 --> 01:19:28.565]  Only callers on this issue who are eyewitnesses to it.
[01:19:28.565 --> 01:19:30.206]  Thank you so much, Bill, for the call.
[01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:46.534]  If it doesn't make you mad that there's a secret police grid openly registering and tracking gun owners, openly paying service people in your home to spy on you, openly after you and your family.
[01:19:46.534 --> 01:19:48.414]  This is illegal!
[01:19:48.414 --> 01:19:50.514]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:19:50.514 --> 01:19:55.015]  We need to stand up to these people doing this and say, look crooks, it's over.
[01:19:55.015 --> 01:19:58.076]  We need to have prosecutions of the murdering BATF!
[01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.969]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:04.870]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:06.712]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[01:20:06.712 --> 01:20:08.154]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:20:08.154 --> 01:20:10.937]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:20:10.937 --> 01:20:16.602]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:20:16.602 --> 01:20:18.284]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:20:18.284 --> 01:20:20.887]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:20:20.887 --> 01:20:21.347]  No More Mortgage.
[01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:24.650]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:27.151]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:31.054]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:20:31.054 --> 01:20:33.195]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.

[01:20:52.145 --> 01:20:53.086]  Call the number.

[01:20:57.328 --> 01:21:03.511]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:07.133]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:21:07.273 --> 01:21:10.136]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.136 --> 01:21:13.520]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.781]  Quality above all else.
[01:21:14.781 --> 01:21:19.266]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:21:19.266 --> 01:21:21.348]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:21:21.348 --> 01:21:23.751]  At Graf Undersafes, security is their sole purpose.
[01:21:23.911 --> 01:21:24.511]  We're good to go.
[01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:42.323]  I think so.
[01:22:00.871 --> 01:22:04.935]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:04.935 --> 01:22:10.840]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.941]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:11.941 --> 01:22:15.985]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:29.970]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:36.053]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:36.053 --> 01:22:41.875]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:22:42.695 --> 01:22:43.957]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:43.957 --> 01:22:45.679]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:22:45.679 --> 01:22:46.119]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.119 --> 01:22:48.162]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:48.162 --> 01:22:48.222]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:10.387 --> 01:23:10.747]  I think so.
[01:23:31.169 --> 01:23:31.469]  I think so.
[01:24:03.226 --> 01:24:06.067]  Let me explain what Bill in Colorado was saying.
[01:24:06.067 --> 01:24:08.068]  We're trying to confirm this.
[01:24:08.068 --> 01:24:15.751]  I know Walmart to buy ammo makes you produce an ID, now they keep a record of, registering gun owners.
[01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:21.293]  But to get in the gun show after you pay, just to get in, not to go buy a firearm.
[01:24:21.293 --> 01:24:26.255]  In most states it's not illegal to have private sales from person to person at the gun show.
[01:24:26.255 --> 01:24:27.055]  They don't like that.
[01:24:29.574 --> 01:24:37.936]  It's just incredible and we opened the phones up for about 60 seconds and 11 calls got through because we can take basically unlimited calls.
[01:24:37.936 --> 01:24:46.118]  But we're going through these person after person having to show their ID to get ammo or social security to get into gun shows.
[01:24:46.118 --> 01:24:50.279]  And so it'll be next segment before we go to those people as we're having to answer all those calls.
[01:24:50.279 --> 01:24:51.919]  Let's go to Adam in Missouri.
[01:24:51.919 --> 01:24:56.861]  I'm also going to be covering the Copenhagen Summit, the global government takeover happening right now.
[01:24:56.861 --> 01:24:58.221]  Adam and Missouri are on the air.
[01:24:59.315 --> 01:25:01.016]  Thank you, sir, for taking my call.
[01:25:01.016 --> 01:25:07.080]  I just want to commend you and the listeners out there that we are fighting a good fight.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.462]  And I do have a few questions.
[01:25:10.462 --> 01:25:13.224]  One is about the global warming.
[01:25:13.224 --> 01:25:16.667]  Back in the 80s, we're about the same age.
[01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:23.111]  And back in the 80s, I remember in grade school, they were saying carbon monoxide, not dioxide, but monoxide.
[01:25:23.624 --> 01:25:26.386]  Was actually harmful to the atmosphere.
[01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:33.953]  And that's one thing I think people are getting misconstrued thinking that the carbon dioxide out there is because people are asleep.
[01:25:34.731 --> 01:25:39.553]  And they need to be woken up because they're complacent with their video games and what have you.
[01:25:39.553 --> 01:25:42.234]  But what's your take?
[01:25:42.234 --> 01:25:44.375]  Do you think that... No, you're absolutely right.
[01:25:44.375 --> 01:25:50.657]  People are programmed with that word because I get emails all the time saying, how dare you say carbon monoxide isn't bad?
[01:25:50.657 --> 01:25:52.078]  I'm saying dioxide.
[01:25:52.078 --> 01:25:53.738]  That's what they're going to tax.
[01:25:53.738 --> 01:25:54.579]  Dioxide.
[01:25:54.579 --> 01:25:57.480]  Carbon dioxide, not monoxide.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.921]  Do you think we should... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:00.921 --> 01:26:02.802]  No, it's just absolute idiocy.
[01:26:03.556 --> 01:26:17.739]  And I was wondering, do you think, though, despite of the global dominance that they have on this market, do you think, though, that we should take measures to renewable energies, clean fuel, things like that?
[01:26:19.116 --> 01:26:28.162]  Yes, but what they do is they candy coat their agenda around clean cars and windmills and, you know, technologies that certainly have some good usage.
[01:26:28.162 --> 01:26:29.282]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:26:29.282 --> 01:26:34.045]  These are private banks that you'll have to buy carbon credits for.
[01:26:34.045 --> 01:26:46.974]  They're already making hundreds of billions a year before it even officially launches on the New York, Chicago, London, Berlin, Paris, and other carbon trading exchanges.
[01:26:47.845 --> 01:26:49.008]  Okay?
[01:26:49.008 --> 01:26:54.462]  Just ahead of the Copenhagen Summit last week, I was seeing the numbers of just billions being made a day!
[01:26:55.914 --> 01:26:57.576]  On the carbon credits.
[01:26:57.576 --> 01:26:59.938]  It's just made up derivative crud.
[01:26:59.938 --> 01:27:01.439]  Everything is a fraud.
[01:27:01.439 --> 01:27:06.744]  So of course the Fortune 500 and the big banks are all for this because they made the plan.
[01:27:06.744 --> 01:27:10.648]  You pay a tax to banks for derivatives.
[01:27:10.648 --> 01:27:13.831]  They just make up taxing thin air.
[01:27:13.831 --> 01:27:15.573]  It's the biggest fraud in the galaxy.
[01:27:15.573 --> 01:27:16.994]  Thank you, Adam.
[01:27:16.994 --> 01:27:17.855]  Mike in Illinois.
[01:27:17.855 --> 01:27:18.636]  You're on the air, Mike.
[01:27:20.612 --> 01:27:22.433]  Alex, let me introduce myself.
[01:27:22.433 --> 01:27:23.514]  My name is Mike St.
[01:27:23.514 --> 01:27:24.354]  Charles, Illinois.
[01:27:24.354 --> 01:27:26.975]  I work closely with We Are Change Chicago.
[01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:32.078]  I also train individuals every Sunday how to defend themselves.
[01:27:32.078 --> 01:27:39.342]  I call in locally to All Air America, left-wing radio, right-wing radio, to expose their problems.
[01:27:39.342 --> 01:27:43.544]  But what I do is I'd like your listeners to try this psychology on them.
[01:27:43.544 --> 01:27:47.106]  It's called the Compliment Sandwich, and it works fairly well.
[01:27:47.106 --> 01:27:48.306]  What you do is you call in.
[01:27:48.306 --> 01:27:49.647]  This is so you don't get hung up on.
[01:27:50.129 --> 01:27:50.349]  Are you
[01:28:06.129 --> 01:28:24.038]  Constantly, for all the shows that I've called in, and you gain a little respect, that way they don't just block your number, or they, you know... Absolutely, a lot of people that try to sneak past the establishment screeners will kind of rush it out, or act suspicious, and then the people are on guard.
[01:28:24.038 --> 01:28:28.741]  Just calmly say, hey, got all these world leaders calling for world government.
[01:28:28.741 --> 01:28:32.022]  Did you see the New York Times, or Bankai Moon called for global government?
[01:28:32.022 --> 01:28:32.543]  Unelected.
[01:28:33.984 --> 01:28:37.886]  And say, yeah, the article's titled, We Can Do It, Ban Kai-moon.
[01:28:37.886 --> 01:28:40.047]  I mean, do you have a computer in front of you?
[01:28:40.047 --> 01:28:41.108]  Google that!
[01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:44.670]  I mean, are you guys still saying there isn't a global government?
[01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:49.694]  And then everybody listening, or many of them, will go check it out and go, whoa!
[01:28:49.694 --> 01:28:51.095]  World government!
[01:28:51.095 --> 01:28:58.840]  Or, hey, have you seen the video clip on YouTube of the new head of the EU saying global government's taking over, and it's going to be a one-child policy for everybody?
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:09.846]  Or, hey, did you hear about Obama in the health care bill to cut Medicare by $41 billion, Medicaid by another $70 billion a year?
[01:29:09.846 --> 01:29:13.588]  Man, this health care bill cutting people's health care.
[01:29:13.588 --> 01:29:21.352]  Dennis Kucinich, who's a socialist, if you're on a liberal show, he says it's nothing but a tax, a bailout to the insurance companies.
[01:29:21.972 --> 01:29:24.572]  And just sabotage the left-right paradigm.
[01:29:24.572 --> 01:29:25.913]  Expose it for the fraud it is.
[01:29:25.913 --> 01:29:27.713]  Good to hear from you, Mike.
[01:29:27.713 --> 01:29:29.553]  Zach, Dan, Jim, Jeremy, and others.
[01:29:29.553 --> 01:29:34.714]  Now, I'm going to get a list now, because we just put the number out 10 minutes ago.
[01:29:34.714 --> 01:29:40.115]  I'm going to get a list now of all these callers calling in about the gun situation.
[01:29:40.115 --> 01:29:46.396]  Were they forced to give social security numbers just to get into gun shows or to buy ammo at stores around the country?
[01:29:46.396 --> 01:29:49.657]  We know it's happening, but I want you to hear it directly from listeners.
[01:29:50.711 --> 01:29:54.662]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.662 --> 01:29:57.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.138 --> 01:30:06.701]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:05.347]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.347 --> 01:31:08.590]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:13.394]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.394 --> 01:31:19.760]  They have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.023]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.523 --> 01:31:22.843]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:22.843 --> 01:31:23.364]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.364 --> 01:31:23.964]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:23.964 --> 01:31:24.704]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:24.704 --> 01:31:26.826]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.454 --> 01:31:45.839]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:31:45.839 --> 01:31:48.722]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:48.722 --> 01:31:57.852]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.543]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.543 --> 01:32:08.888]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:08.888 --> 01:32:10.930]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:15.935]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.935 --> 01:32:16.856]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:18.217]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.217 --> 01:32:20.118]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:21.179]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.179 --> 01:32:23.380]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.721]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.721 --> 01:32:26.262]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.262 --> 01:32:31.526]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.526 --> 01:32:35.108]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.108 --> 01:32:38.571]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:38.911 --> 01:32:40.151]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:41.051]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:42.152]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.152 --> 01:32:43.072]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.072 --> 01:32:44.172]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.172 --> 01:32:47.232]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.232 --> 01:32:49.413]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.413 --> 01:32:50.533]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:50.533 --> 01:32:52.013]  We open the phone system up.
[01:33:08.803 --> 01:33:14.207]  We have a computerized phone system versus the Genesis system and 11 calls came in in 30 seconds.
[01:33:14.207 --> 01:33:23.453]  We closed the gate and while we were screening those calls, we don't normally screen them, but if it's on a particular topic, making sure people were calling in as eyewitnesses.
[01:33:24.386 --> 01:33:30.630]  To having to give their social security numbers or driver's license to go in gun shows or to buy ammo at places like Walmart.
[01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:35.473]  Now, I've confirmed Walmart does do this, but it's going on nationwide.
[01:33:35.473 --> 01:33:38.114]  Social security numbers are even worse at the gun shows.
[01:33:38.114 --> 01:33:40.055]  Not to buy a gun to get in.
[01:33:40.055 --> 01:33:41.896]  After you pay, they don't tell you.
[01:33:41.896 --> 01:33:44.618]  The feds are there ordering this to happen.
[01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:47.620]  I don't know if that's confirmed with this Denver show, but we've confirmed it with others.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:49.561]  But I want you to hear from listeners.
[01:33:49.561 --> 01:33:50.922]  Now, I'm going to open the phones up again.
[01:33:51.502 --> 01:33:56.846]  For any of those other people that tried to call in and hung up when they were on hold, I want to hear from you.
[01:33:56.846 --> 01:34:04.952]  Now, so we can get all these reports on air, I'm going to give each caller a minute or two, depending on how key their info is, and move to the next person.
[01:34:04.952 --> 01:34:08.214]  I'm opening the phones up now.
[01:34:08.214 --> 01:34:09.715]  888-201-2244.
[01:34:09.715 --> 01:34:13.918]  Now the call screener is just going to ask, do you have an eyewitness report, and go to the next person.
[01:34:13.918 --> 01:34:15.540]  So don't try to tell them the story.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.480]  Just don't call in.
[01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:19.762]  To the backup number 888-201-2244.
[01:34:19.762 --> 01:34:25.445]  888-201-2244, unless you have an eyewitness report.
[01:34:25.445 --> 01:34:37.371]  Then I'm going to go ahead next hour and launch into the latest on Climategate, the Copenhagen situation, but this is important just to illustrate the incredible tyranny we're living under.
[01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:42.153]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Mike in Illinois.
[01:34:42.153 --> 01:34:45.275]  I guess another Mike from Illinois.
[01:34:45.275 --> 01:34:46.936]  Mike, what is your eyewitness report?
[01:34:48.137 --> 01:34:49.278]  Well, mine was this morning.
[01:34:49.278 --> 01:34:55.363]  I'm in Northern Illinois and took in some scrap aluminum to a, uh, whatever they take scrap aluminum to.
[01:34:55.363 --> 01:34:59.006]  And anyways, one of the things was, uh, they asked for my driver's license.
[01:34:59.006 --> 01:35:00.628]  They even turned that over.
[01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:05.692]  And I just handed her in plastic and she said, uh, you have to take it out of there because I have to scan this.
[01:35:05.692 --> 01:35:07.974]  And what it is, it goes into the computerized system.
[01:35:08.328 --> 01:35:10.290]  To make sure you're not stealing aluminum.
[01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:12.593]  And here's the deal, it's guilty until proven innocent.
[01:35:12.593 --> 01:35:24.828]  I remember six years ago, speaking of Illinois, they had a Chicago Global Security Summit with the Fortune 500 and they said, we're training the public to show ID to buy and sell, period, for the carbon tax.
[01:35:25.809 --> 01:35:31.574]  And if you're not in good with the government in the future, your ID will say you're not allowed to buy and sell.
[01:35:31.574 --> 01:35:32.875]  No, this isn't revelations.
[01:35:32.875 --> 01:35:34.877]  This is what's happening now.
[01:35:34.877 --> 01:35:37.219]  So she wanted to scan your driver's license.
[01:35:37.219 --> 01:35:39.781]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:35:39.781 --> 01:35:41.522]  Yeah, I'm a criminal until proven innocent.
[01:35:41.522 --> 01:35:49.069]  Yeah, so that's one of the things that really bothers me about living in America today is I'm put right up there, right with the criminals, and yet I'm living a rightly life out here.
[01:35:49.485 --> 01:35:53.749]  But the bankers can steal trillions publicly, not say where the money went.
[01:35:53.749 --> 01:35:54.790]  That's okay.
[01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:55.770]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:35:55.770 --> 01:35:57.432]  Let's talk to Fred in Denver.
[01:35:57.432 --> 01:35:58.192]  Fred, you're on the air.
[01:35:58.192 --> 01:35:59.734]  Go ahead.
[01:35:59.734 --> 01:36:00.995]  Yes, am I on?
[01:36:00.995 --> 01:36:01.716]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:01.716 --> 01:36:02.716]  Hello.
[01:36:02.716 --> 01:36:07.400]  Yes, that is indeed happening at Tanner Gunshow.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.925]  I was able to skirt it because I know a vendor, and he got me around this little thing.
[01:36:12.925 --> 01:36:15.888]  I don't really want to say on the air in case I, you know.
[01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:19.412]  No, that's fine, because it's Secret Police America.
[01:36:19.412 --> 01:36:27.117]  So you buy your ticket, they don't tell you how much did the ticket cost, who is this woman, did you ask her, who are you?
[01:36:27.117 --> 01:36:29.158]  People need to stand up to this.
[01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:34.782]  But no, Americans... I immediately was able to get around.
[01:36:34.782 --> 01:36:35.802]  I kind of had a head start.
[01:36:35.802 --> 01:36:36.423]  I'm going to stop you.
[01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.484]  I'm going to stop you, Fred.
[01:36:37.484 --> 01:36:39.485]  Slowly tell the story.
[01:36:39.485 --> 01:36:40.766]  When did this happen?
[01:36:40.766 --> 01:36:42.107]  Where is it located?
[01:36:42.107 --> 01:36:43.828]  Blow by blow.
[01:36:43.828 --> 01:36:45.929]  Okay, it's called the Denver Merchandise Mart.
[01:36:47.521 --> 01:36:50.001]  It's at I-25 and 58th Avenue in Denver.
[01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:52.822]  They've had the Tanner Gun Show for years there.
[01:36:52.822 --> 01:36:55.222]  I've never seen this before.
[01:36:55.222 --> 01:36:56.763]  Never seen it before.
[01:36:56.763 --> 01:36:57.623]  You pay your money.
[01:36:57.623 --> 01:36:59.863]  There is people that stamp your hand.
[01:36:59.863 --> 01:37:05.104]  That's where they're doing this, and my buddy gave me a heads up, and he was waiting.
[01:37:05.104 --> 01:37:14.766]  I called him on my cell, and he kind of, I really don't want to say how I skirted it, but I got to skirt it without giving my number, but that's exactly what's going on.
[01:37:15.276 --> 01:37:19.740]  There are ATF, there's an ATF booth in there by the way.
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:25.084]  There are so many agents and operatives in the show now, you bump into them.
[01:37:25.084 --> 01:37:26.806]  All taxpayers paid for!
[01:37:26.806 --> 01:37:31.170]  They didn't triple under Bush the size of the BATF for nothing.
[01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:34.592]  They are coming for your guns.
[01:37:34.592 --> 01:37:39.837]  Every time you stop at a table and start discussing anything that's assault weapon related,
[01:37:40.373 --> 01:37:47.395]  There's somebody immediately there at your elbow, and it's real easy to spot a jackboot once you know what they look like.
[01:37:47.395 --> 01:37:51.716]  And there was... I'd say there's two dozen of them in the show.
[01:37:51.716 --> 01:37:57.178]  And everywhere there was anything assault or you started up a conversation, they were there.
[01:37:57.178 --> 01:37:58.838]  Right there by your elbow.
[01:37:58.838 --> 01:38:00.338]  Secret police!
[01:38:00.338 --> 01:38:05.220]  Secret police in there trying to entrap you, legally trying to buy a gun.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.820]  Secret police everywhere in America.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.301]  This is just outrageous.
[01:38:10.236 --> 01:38:21.325]  As a matter of fact, they were even trying to entrap people with certain parts sets to certain lower receivers, telling you you could go ahead and buy it.
[01:38:21.325 --> 01:38:24.007]  I guarantee you this is happening in the show.
[01:38:24.007 --> 01:38:28.070]  If I could find a way to get a camera in there, because they don't allow any photography.
[01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:29.991]  They have hidden cameras.
[01:38:29.991 --> 01:38:32.714]  I could film them trying to entrap you.
[01:38:32.714 --> 01:38:37.497]  Diginet.net, get a $70 pen cam.
[01:38:37.497 --> 01:38:39.439]  But that is indeed what is happening.
[01:38:39.978 --> 01:38:41.038]  And I cannot believe it.
[01:38:41.038 --> 01:38:42.919]  I've been going to that show for over 20 years.
[01:38:42.919 --> 01:38:56.962]  Well, what we've got to do is, you have to understand, and I'm not saying don't blame the shows, but understand, they get cornered, they get threatened through color of law and intimidated and turned into secret police operatives, being threatened with being shut down.
[01:38:56.962 --> 01:38:58.722]  And this is going on in Texas.
[01:38:58.722 --> 01:39:01.543]  Silica Stillo exposed it and they set him up.
[01:39:01.543 --> 01:39:03.223]  These are very vicious people.
[01:39:03.763 --> 01:39:06.425]  I mean, look what they did at Waco in Oklahoma City.
[01:39:06.425 --> 01:39:08.866]  Those were both BATF operations.
[01:39:08.866 --> 01:39:11.828]  And these are very sinister, sinister people.
[01:39:11.828 --> 01:39:12.969]  Very dangerous.
[01:39:12.969 --> 01:39:17.671]  And you need to make a big issue out of this, wherever this is happening.
[01:39:17.671 --> 01:39:18.852]  Go out and protest.
[01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:20.313]  Point this out.
[01:39:20.313 --> 01:39:21.454]  Thank you so much, Fred.
[01:39:22.114 --> 01:39:29.382]  And I need everybody this has happened to to write your descriptions of what happened and send it in to writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:39:29.382 --> 01:39:38.290]  We're going to put a compilation article together and demand Gun Owners of America and others point out what's going on.
[01:39:38.290 --> 01:39:41.233]  They've now got these people at gun ranges.
[01:39:42.304 --> 01:39:43.885]  Writing down license plates.
[01:39:43.885 --> 01:39:46.147]  You are all being put in a database.
[01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:48.830]  This is all part of the Homeland Security MIAC report.
[01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:50.511]  Homeland Security, the U.S.
[01:39:50.511 --> 01:39:54.335]  Army, NORTHCOM, is focused on you!
[01:39:54.335 --> 01:39:56.937]  And stop kissing up to the government and the military.
[01:39:56.937 --> 01:39:58.398]  They're no longer legitimate.
[01:39:58.398 --> 01:40:00.160]  They work for offshore banks.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.421]  We've been taken over.
[01:40:01.421 --> 01:40:04.524]  It happened to Germany, it happened to Russia, it happened to China.
[01:40:04.524 --> 01:40:07.826]  America has been taken over by crooks!
[01:40:07.826 --> 01:40:09.308]  What is it you can't get about that?
[01:40:11.493 --> 01:40:12.153]  Do you understand?
[01:40:12.153 --> 01:40:13.314]  They are illegitimate.
[01:40:13.314 --> 01:40:15.895]  They are criminal.
[01:40:15.895 --> 01:40:19.156]  They want your gun so bad they can taste it.
[01:40:19.156 --> 01:40:24.178]  They're getting ready for war against the people.
[01:40:24.178 --> 01:40:25.718]  These people are so evil.
[01:40:25.718 --> 01:40:26.499]  So evil.
[01:40:26.499 --> 01:40:29.440]  So evil.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.341]  Let's go ahead and take more calls here.
[01:40:33.341 --> 01:40:36.402]  Okay, the call list just changed on me.
[01:40:36.402 --> 01:40:37.743]  Okay, Alex in Virginia.
[01:40:37.743 --> 01:40:38.383]  Alex, go ahead.
[01:40:39.788 --> 01:40:43.209]  Hi, I went to the Nation's Gun Show in Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:40:43.209 --> 01:40:46.650]  I think it was in either late September or October.
[01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:56.714]  And it was the first gun show I went to, and while we were in the parking lot walking towards the entrance, I actually noticed federal agents walking through the parking lot looking at license plates.
[01:40:57.589 --> 01:41:00.031]  And me and my friends were like, alright, that's kind of strange.
[01:41:00.031 --> 01:41:03.593]  Yeah, they're intimidating us into giving up our Second Amendment.
[01:41:03.593 --> 01:41:08.057]  It's like we're Jews in Nazi Germany and the wolves are swarming around us.
[01:41:08.057 --> 01:41:11.519]  They can't wait to get into our flesh.
[01:41:11.519 --> 01:41:25.349]  Yeah, and then, well, the funny thing is we go to the entrance and I paid with the card and she asked for my license and she took it and she was writing stuff down on a pad of paper and I honestly didn't think anything of it until I was listening earlier today and you brought it up.
[01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:35.337]  And then I went inside and, um, the place looked like there was a lot of it seemed like the, um, kind of Glenn Beck crowd, the fake Patriot crowd there.
[01:41:35.337 --> 01:41:40.681]  And there was also a lot of, um, it looked like there was a lot of federal agents walking around.
[01:41:40.681 --> 01:41:42.183]  And they love the government.
[01:41:42.183 --> 01:41:44.645]  They love being registered and put on a list.
[01:41:44.645 --> 01:41:48.267]  They just kiss up to any uniform.
[01:41:48.267 --> 01:41:50.849]  Oh, they can't wait till they're drug away to the FEMA camp.
[01:41:50.849 --> 01:41:51.430]  They love it.
[01:41:52.935 --> 01:41:53.536]  Yeah, I know.
[01:41:53.536 --> 01:41:58.861]  And the weirdest thing was there was this one table, and there was no one around it, and it was selling books.
[01:41:58.861 --> 01:42:03.385]  And they had, like, the Turner Diaries and these other white supremacist books.
[01:42:03.385 --> 01:42:05.708]  Always federally run.
[01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:06.428]  Always.
[01:42:06.428 --> 01:42:12.034]  There's a camera up in the ceiling above those, and they're just, anybody buying that, you're being put in a database.
[01:42:12.034 --> 01:42:14.717]  Next time you go to buy a gun, they'll say, sorry, can't buy a gun now.
[01:42:16.085 --> 01:42:19.808]  They actually did have a hidden camera above it, one of those like... Of course!
[01:42:19.808 --> 01:42:21.890]  No, I have this from insiders.
[01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:23.351]  They're all surveilled.
[01:42:23.351 --> 01:42:24.012]  It's all criminal.
[01:42:24.012 --> 01:42:31.698]  Yeah, and then they had like the anarchist cookbook and then they had these other really weird books where I was looking through it and it was like... Yeah, it's never mainline Patriot stuff.
[01:42:31.698 --> 01:42:36.482]  It's all for the news media to come in to and show it to demonize gun shows.
[01:42:36.482 --> 01:42:38.684]  It's all an operation.
[01:42:38.684 --> 01:42:39.444]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:39.444 --> 01:42:42.707]  I mean, they had these weird books and it was like guerrilla tactics and like
[01:42:43.251 --> 01:42:50.076]  Urban warfare but it wasn't like it wasn't like a military manual this was like almost like a terrorist book or something and I'm thinking like
[01:42:50.569 --> 01:42:57.194]  You know, this is so obvious that... No, it's BATF or their informants behind the counter, FBI, full surveillance.
[01:42:57.194 --> 01:43:00.056]  The number one enemy of the globalists is the American people.
[01:43:00.056 --> 01:43:03.698]  The entire homeland security system is for the American people.
[01:43:03.698 --> 01:43:10.943]  The banks have taken over and they're totally scared, just like Goldman Sachs is arming to the teeth with weapons against the American people.
[01:43:10.943 --> 01:43:17.808]  Bloomberg reports they know they've committed crime, they know they want to take over, and they are scared to death of the American people.
[01:43:17.808 --> 01:43:18.789]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:18.789 --> 01:43:19.890]  Alright, thank you.
[01:43:20.526 --> 01:43:25.728]  Yeah, what's going to happen is when they implement martial law, suddenly all gun owners' credit cards aren't going to work.
[01:43:25.728 --> 01:43:27.769]  You're not going to be able to get on planes.
[01:43:27.769 --> 01:43:30.830]  There's license plate readers at checkpoints.
[01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:41.054]  You'll see them letting cars through, but when you pull up, you know, a heavy will swing out from the back of a truck, and the minute you don't go out, they're just going to open up on you.
[01:43:41.054 --> 01:43:45.796]  And then in a few spots, they'll kill a few cops and say you did it and put your dead body on the news.
[01:43:45.796 --> 01:43:49.858]  You know, this guy, John Doe, took out the cops at a checkpoint.
[01:43:50.498 --> 01:43:55.680]  They'll be BATF Greasin' Cops here and there to get the cops all hyped up to go after the American people.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.041]  It's hell!
[01:43:57.041 --> 01:43:58.422]  Okay, Daniel in Texas.
[01:43:58.422 --> 01:43:59.622]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[01:43:59.622 --> 01:44:01.043]  Go ahead.
[01:44:01.043 --> 01:44:01.443]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:01.443 --> 01:44:02.323]  Hello.
[01:44:02.323 --> 01:44:03.744]  Welcome.
[01:44:03.744 --> 01:44:09.367]  Let's see, a couple days ago, actually a couple weeks ago, my Uncle John came into town.
[01:44:09.367 --> 01:44:12.188]  We don't really get to see my uncle too often.
[01:44:12.188 --> 01:44:13.369]  He came into town.
[01:44:13.369 --> 01:44:16.090]  He was passing through El Paso just to get to
[01:44:17.748 --> 01:44:20.749]  Get to New Mexico to go do some hunting, blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:20.749 --> 01:44:30.713]  And, uh, you know, we were on the way to leaving, and he said, uh, you know, Dan, go buy some, uh, some shells, you know, before we go, uh, because I forgot to bring some.
[01:44:30.713 --> 01:44:34.994]  So I was on the way driving, uh, got to Walmart, whatever, went to go buy them.
[01:44:34.994 --> 01:44:45.778]  Went to a lady, asked for the shells that he wanted, and she asked me for an ID, and she said, okay, well, first of all, I thought maybe it's because I looked, I looked younger, you know, so I was like, alright, he had to be
[01:44:47.117 --> 01:44:51.188]  18 to buy a rifle or need ammunition for the rifle.
[01:44:51.188 --> 01:44:52.412]  I'm 21, so I showed her my ID.
[01:44:52.412 --> 01:44:53.735]  She said, OK, fine.
[01:44:53.735 --> 01:44:54.918]  I need your social security.
[01:44:57.096 --> 01:45:02.181]  No, the secret police grid is now in place and no one's talking about it.
[01:45:02.181 --> 01:45:03.323]  No one cares.
[01:45:03.323 --> 01:45:05.144]  World government's being announced.
[01:45:05.144 --> 01:45:06.325]  It's so sad.
[01:45:06.325 --> 01:45:08.528]  Our country's already gone down.
[01:45:08.528 --> 01:45:11.170]  We have to admit it's gone down.
[01:45:11.170 --> 01:45:13.392]  So now she wants your social security.
[01:45:13.392 --> 01:45:15.054]  She takes it out and scans it.
[01:45:15.054 --> 01:45:18.377]  What do you mean, my social security?
[01:45:18.377 --> 01:45:19.658]  I mean, it's the Second Amendment, right?
[01:45:20.874 --> 01:45:29.518]  You know, I mean, why would you need my social security when our own law, you know, it shouldn't be this hard to do, to buy simple ammo.
[01:45:29.518 --> 01:45:32.620]  And I clearly do look over the age to buy simple ammo.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:34.461]  You've already started the argument.
[01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:35.781]  What happens?
[01:45:35.781 --> 01:45:37.222]  What does she say?
[01:45:37.222 --> 01:45:39.923]  Well, she, she tried to pull out some documents.
[01:45:39.923 --> 01:45:41.424]  She pulled out some bogus looking...
[01:45:42.714 --> 01:45:46.596]  Uh, documents saying that, uh, DHS, you know, is required, blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:46.596 --> 01:45:50.998]  I asked if she said DHS, and she showed me this bogus-looking piece of paper.
[01:45:50.998 --> 01:45:55.760]  Yeah, there's no law, but see, Homeland Security has given them a covert directive.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:59.762]  I'm surprised you were shown that, because Walmart is completely run by FEMA.
[01:45:59.762 --> 01:46:01.202]  It's a fake corporation.
[01:46:01.202 --> 01:46:03.243]  The FBI runs it up in Fayetteville.
[01:46:03.243 --> 01:46:07.305]  That's been declassified to totally fake, to bankrupt, uh, middle America.
[01:46:08.334 --> 01:46:13.373]  Exactly, and then after she showed me that document, the second she said DHS, I was like, you know what, forget that.
[01:46:13.373 --> 01:46:14.276]  I mean, keep your...
[01:46:15.043 --> 01:46:18.084]  I didn't even give her my social security after that.
[01:46:18.084 --> 01:46:20.185]  The idea was enough for me.
[01:46:20.185 --> 01:46:22.445]  Yes, we've got to boycott Walmart.
[01:46:22.445 --> 01:46:23.766]  We've got to boycott Walmart.
[01:46:23.766 --> 01:46:27.567]  It is a sinister... They're admittedly involved with the FEMA camps.
[01:46:27.567 --> 01:46:31.588]  They're going to use their redistribution centers as FEMA camps.
[01:46:31.588 --> 01:46:35.849]  They're admittedly in the news prepared as forced inoculation centers.
[01:46:35.849 --> 01:46:37.450]  Walmart is pure evil.
[01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:40.031]  Target's even worse.
[01:46:40.031 --> 01:46:41.612]  Target's out of Minnesota.
[01:46:41.612 --> 01:46:43.593]  Target is another government front.
[01:46:43.593 --> 01:46:47.395]  Their main business is security systems.
[01:46:47.395 --> 01:46:48.056]  Jesus Christ.
[01:46:48.570 --> 01:46:49.270]  Oh, it's absurd.
[01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:51.952]  The whole Microsoft is a control grid.
[01:46:51.952 --> 01:46:54.033]  IBM is an admitted government front.
[01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:56.995]  It's a giant eugenicist extermination grid.
[01:46:56.995 --> 01:46:58.456]  They've got the kids brainwashed.
[01:46:58.456 --> 01:47:00.077]  They're totally taking over.
[01:47:00.077 --> 01:47:02.218]  The army follows Ron Paul and myself.
[01:47:02.218 --> 01:47:03.359]  Mainstream news.
[01:47:03.359 --> 01:47:04.400]  Homeland Security.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.301]  The American people are the terrorists.
[01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:08.923]  I mean, sir, it is red dawn.
[01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:13.445]  And no one seems to understand what is going to happen once they get control.
[01:47:13.445 --> 01:47:17.068]  They're going to come and take your children and blow your head off.
[01:47:17.935 --> 01:47:19.136]  They mean business!
[01:47:19.136 --> 01:47:24.662]  They have the troops, and the military, and the police, want war with the people!
[01:47:24.662 --> 01:47:26.164]  It is pure evil!
[01:47:26.164 --> 01:47:29.487]  They are Nazi illegitimate trash!
[01:47:29.487 --> 01:47:39.819]  Exactly, and then, like, just listening to your show, I mean, I remember, uh, I mean, when I first saw a few days, I discovered you, I was like, exactly, I was about, it was about time somebody was starting to show these little
[01:47:40.678 --> 01:47:42.479]  And they doll it up so well.
[01:47:42.479 --> 01:47:44.600]  I mean, especially when Obama... No, they don't even tell you.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.281]  They treat you like an animal going into a slaughterhouse.
[01:47:47.281 --> 01:47:48.301]  They act real friendly.
[01:47:48.301 --> 01:47:49.382]  Don't spook you.
[01:47:49.382 --> 01:47:50.202]  Just give it to me.
[01:47:50.202 --> 01:47:51.303]  I'm gonna scan it.
[01:47:51.303 --> 01:47:53.084]  I appreciate your call, Daniel.
[01:47:53.084 --> 01:47:55.685]  All Americans are registered and surveilled.
[01:47:56.576 --> 01:47:58.577]  It is total evil.
[01:47:58.577 --> 01:48:00.558]  It is not for your security.
[01:48:00.558 --> 01:48:01.158]  Okay?
[01:48:01.158 --> 01:48:02.198]  Period.
[01:48:02.198 --> 01:48:06.940]  Let's talk to Bobby in Florida, then Brian, Billy, Sherry, Adam, Jim, and others.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.260]  Bobby, you're on the air.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:12.222]  Tell us your report of being registered secretly as an evil gun owner.
[01:48:12.222 --> 01:48:13.963]  Go ahead, Bobby.
[01:48:13.963 --> 01:48:18.524]  Okay, I went to the Suncoast Gun Show over here in Tampa.
[01:48:18.524 --> 01:48:21.445]  We paid, I think it was $10 to get in.
[01:48:23.976 --> 01:48:32.342]  When you go past where, when you first walk in, there's a table with some ladies that were sitting there, you know, and they were asking for the last four digits of the social.
[01:48:32.342 --> 01:48:35.044]  I mean, we didn't have to pull out any ID or anything.
[01:48:35.044 --> 01:48:37.365]  Again, the feds have ordered this.
[01:48:37.365 --> 01:48:38.366]  But see, they don't need that.
[01:48:38.366 --> 01:48:45.611]  They haven't, listen, they have license plate reading cameras, they're just checking that, and then they flag even more whoever doesn't give it to you.
[01:48:46.365 --> 01:48:51.689]  Yeah, I mean, because you can see them all through the parking lot, you know, and their golf carts going around and, you know... They don't even need that!
[01:48:51.689 --> 01:48:53.170]  They're taking notes.
[01:48:53.170 --> 01:48:57.293]  They can scan 6,000 license plates a minute with the slower units.
[01:48:57.293 --> 01:49:00.615]  When you drive in, it's all being Homeland Security scanned.
[01:49:00.615 --> 01:49:13.344]  Then, when you get out, they've normally got a camera mounted on the roof, they get a face scan, then a satellite, I'm not kidding, dials in, if they've got the SAT time, but that's why they're launching hundreds more to do this, then they get your heat resonance.
[01:49:13.604 --> 01:49:21.087]  They're using the gun shows to get your heat resonance biometric body print to then track.
[01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.607]  This is done in Iraq as well.
[01:49:22.607 --> 01:49:23.548]  It's a total grid.
[01:49:23.548 --> 01:49:28.910]  You're now uploading to the sat grid and they can track you from space off your heat resonance pattern.
[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:29.510]  How do you like that?
[01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:32.191]  Does that sound like a free country to you, buddy?
[01:49:32.191 --> 01:49:33.592]  Uh, no sir, not at all.
[01:49:33.592 --> 01:49:36.172]  How about I just go ahead and lay it all on you?
[01:49:36.172 --> 01:49:37.253]  Lay it on me?
[01:49:37.253 --> 01:49:38.813]  Well, it's just total control.
[01:49:38.813 --> 01:49:41.234]  You order a pizza, it's all tracked.
[01:49:41.234 --> 01:49:42.515]  Everything, just total grid.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:44.540]  Right.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.461]  This government isn't a government.
[01:49:46.461 --> 01:49:50.242]  It is a scientific murder machine.
[01:49:50.242 --> 01:49:51.403]  Yep.
[01:49:51.403 --> 01:49:53.443]  I'm sorry, so what did you tell this lady?
[01:49:53.443 --> 01:49:56.824]  Did you say, oh yes, here's my social security?
[01:49:56.824 --> 01:50:01.426]  Well, when she first asked me for it, I thought, you know, I kind of chuckled a second.
[01:50:01.426 --> 01:50:02.866]  I was like, well wait a minute.
[01:50:02.866 --> 01:50:06.488]  She didn't ask me for an ID, so I just said one, two, three, four.
[01:50:06.488 --> 01:50:10.029]  And she looked down at her page and you can see where she was writing it down.
[01:50:11.158 --> 01:50:14.620]  You know, she was writing that, and you could see where she wrote, like, 1, 2, 3, 4, power.
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.120]  See, this is dog training.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:17.221]  This is dog training.
[01:50:17.221 --> 01:50:20.242]  Next, like you just heard the caller, they're going to want to scan it.
[01:50:20.242 --> 01:50:22.563]  But they know how to incrementally train.
[01:50:22.563 --> 01:50:28.546]  The psychologists have said that if you just let them be in control and not show anything, you watch.
[01:50:28.546 --> 01:50:32.308]  In one year, you go back there, they're going to want to scan everything.
[01:50:32.308 --> 01:50:34.289]  Next, they're going to have a hand scanner there.
[01:50:34.289 --> 01:50:35.770]  So what did she say when she wrote 1, 2, 3, 4 down?
[01:50:37.125 --> 01:50:43.329]  You know, last year you see all the pictures of Obama everywhere saying, he's coming, buy your guns now.
[01:50:43.329 --> 01:50:51.434]  And it's like they were training you then, and now, you know, they're asking for the last four digits, and I guess next time they're going to want to cooperate.
[01:50:51.434 --> 01:50:59.879]  And what they're going to do when they launch their operation is they're going to gun patriots down on the news, they're going to kill cops and say we did it, and then they're going to have a full-out war against us.
[01:51:00.788 --> 01:51:02.549]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[01:51:02.549 --> 01:51:04.069]  Say no to toxic overload.
[01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:05.410]  Say no to chemicals.
[01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:07.351]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[01:51:07.351 --> 01:51:16.134]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[01:51:16.134 --> 01:51:21.396]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[01:51:21.556 --> 01:51:23.358]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[01:51:23.358 --> 01:51:30.846]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[01:51:30.846 --> 01:51:35.031]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[01:51:35.031 --> 01:51:37.534]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[01:51:37.734 --> 01:51:38.915]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:02.884 --> 01:52:05.626]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[01:52:05.626 --> 01:52:08.568]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[01:52:08.568 --> 01:52:14.572]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[01:52:14.572 --> 01:52:15.292]  Here's why.
[01:52:15.292 --> 01:52:23.498]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[01:52:23.498 --> 01:52:27.560]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.902]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank.
[01:52:30.436 --> 01:52:33.418]  That can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:52:33.418 --> 01:52:34.939]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:34.939 --> 01:52:42.483]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[01:52:42.483 --> 01:52:46.785]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:46.785 --> 01:52:48.866]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:48.866 --> 01:52:52.949]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[01:53:00.393 --> 01:53:03.934]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:03.934 --> 01:53:06.215]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:06.215 --> 01:53:07.075]  Don't!
[01:53:07.075 --> 01:53:10.516]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:10.516 --> 01:53:17.658]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:53:17.638 --> 01:53:19.619]  's number one debt secret.
[01:53:19.619 --> 01:53:23.680]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:25.961]  Yes, free for a very limited
[01:53:27.125 --> 01:53:34.189]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:35.389]  Herb K. was right.
[01:53:35.389 --> 01:53:38.551]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:38.551 --> 01:53:39.932]  What have you got to lose?
[01:53:39.932 --> 01:53:43.634]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:53:43.634 --> 01:53:44.294]  Get Herb K.'
[01:53:44.254 --> 01:53:47.576]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:53:47.576 --> 01:53:47.936]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:53:52.019 --> 01:53:52.299]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:54:04.215 --> 01:54:17.623]  Ladies and gentlemen, three years ago, Google came out and said they're using the audio and video cameras on all new computers with AI computers inside your house to record everything you're saying and doing.
[01:54:17.623 --> 01:54:24.787]  And they said, don't worry, a computer's just creating a text file that's been analyzed for advertising.
[01:54:24.787 --> 01:54:28.690]  Imagine if your neighbor came to your house and said, hey, mind if I put a camera in your home watching you?
[01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:30.451]  You'd freak out on them.
[01:54:30.871 --> 01:54:33.112]  But Google just announces it like it's no big deal.
[01:54:33.112 --> 01:54:35.694]  That's why we've got to really start using startpage.com.
[01:54:35.694 --> 01:54:40.437]  It's really just a proxy that goes through Google, but blocks them getting your data.
[01:54:40.437 --> 01:54:44.339]  It says, Google CEO, secrets are for filthy people.
[01:54:44.339 --> 01:54:50.463]  Eric Schmidt suggests you are scandalous behavior before you complain about the company invading your privacy.
[01:54:50.463 --> 01:54:54.686]  That's what the Google CEO, who's a big global warming tax guy, told Maria
[01:54:57.213 --> 01:55:04.459]  Bartoremo during CNBC's big Google special last night, an extraordinary pronouncement for such a secretive guy.
[01:55:04.459 --> 01:55:11.144]  So, here they are, using all this data against you, forcing you to give Social Security numbers to buy ammo.
[01:55:11.144 --> 01:55:12.645]  Outside the law, just doing it.
[01:55:12.645 --> 01:55:14.347]  The Fed's ordering it nationwide.
[01:55:14.347 --> 01:55:16.368]  These companies aren't doing it by themselves.
[01:55:16.368 --> 01:55:21.693]  We're going to go back to Billy, Sherry, Jim, and others this has happened to in a moment, but here is the Google
[01:55:22.213 --> 01:55:23.614]  Well, I think judgment matters.
[01:55:23.614 --> 01:55:24.594]  Eric Schmidt is Google's CEO.
[01:55:45.202 --> 01:55:50.586]  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[01:55:50.586 --> 01:55:59.373]  But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time.
[01:55:59.373 --> 01:56:04.076]  And it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act.
[01:56:04.076 --> 01:56:08.960]  It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities.
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:09.600]  Everything!
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.981]  Google is the NSA.
[01:56:12.679 --> 01:56:15.160]  But so is every other major tech company.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.121]  You need to know that.
[01:56:17.121 --> 01:56:19.022]  You need to understand that.
[01:56:19.022 --> 01:56:22.023]  This is the global domination system.
[01:56:22.023 --> 01:56:22.783]  Okay?
[01:56:22.783 --> 01:56:23.204]  Period.
[01:56:23.204 --> 01:56:24.724]  But don't let it chill you.
[01:56:24.724 --> 01:56:28.286]  They're out announcing, they're surveilling you, so you shut up and get scared.
[01:56:28.286 --> 01:56:31.127]  You gotta say, look crooks, we don't like what you're doing.
[01:56:31.127 --> 01:56:32.628]  And start videotaping them.
[01:56:32.628 --> 01:56:34.969]  Start putting their information out in the public.
[01:56:34.969 --> 01:56:37.730]  See how they like it.
[01:56:37.730 --> 01:56:39.691]  Billy in Pennsylvania, what happened to you?
[01:56:43.735 --> 01:56:45.055]  Go ahead.
[01:56:45.055 --> 01:56:48.176]  Can you hear me?
[01:56:48.176 --> 01:56:49.777]  Yes I can, Billy.
[01:56:49.777 --> 01:57:01.720]  Okay, so I was at the Valley Forge Gun Show, and they had multiple booths set up, and multiple bracelets you got when you went into the show.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:10.122]  One of them, everybody had to show an ID, but they had another booth where you could go through Pennsylvania Instant Check,
[01:57:10.914 --> 01:57:30.842]  If you wanted to, and forego having to pay the entry fee for the gun show, then they said that if you took the infant check there, that you wouldn't have to do it if you bought a gun, but that wasn't true because I ended up buying one.
[01:57:30.842 --> 01:57:31.982]  No, these are criminals.
[01:57:31.982 --> 01:57:35.544]  Of course they lie.
[01:57:35.544 --> 01:57:36.284]  That's what happened to me.
[01:57:37.799 --> 01:57:43.523]  And so you went ahead and went through it, and then you went to buy a gun, and they said, no, you've got to do it again.
[01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:49.487]  Yeah, well, I didn't know anything about this, and actually at the gun show is where I got my first copy of anything.
[01:57:49.487 --> 01:57:52.609]  And see, none of the gun magazines are reporting it.
[01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:54.190]  No one's talking about it.
[01:57:54.190 --> 01:57:55.691]  No one's going to tell you.
[01:57:55.691 --> 01:57:57.392]  They're just doing it.
[01:57:57.392 --> 01:57:59.414]  I appreciate your call, Billy.
[01:57:59.414 --> 01:58:01.415]  Sherry in Missouri, tell us what happened to you.
[01:58:01.415 --> 01:58:04.837]  Hello, Alex.
[01:58:04.837 --> 01:58:07.379]  I didn't know about Walmart being owned by FEMA.
[01:58:07.799 --> 01:58:09.501]  But that explains what happened.
[01:58:09.501 --> 01:58:09.622]  Okay.
[01:58:09.622 --> 01:58:15.149]  Well, I went in there not to buy ammo or a gun but I went in there simply to get a landowner's permit for hunting.
[01:58:24.871 --> 01:58:32.696]  Sure, and if you haven't paid your taxes or alimony or whatever, then you can't get a gun.
[01:58:32.696 --> 01:58:34.097]  And they also try to trick you.
[01:58:34.097 --> 01:58:37.199]  Let me tell you a story about that when we get back.
[01:58:37.199 --> 01:58:38.520]  Everything is secret police.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.202]  The public's being trained.

[01:59:53.482 --> 01:59:55.864]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.864 --> 01:59:58.647]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.157 --> 02:00:09.980]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.561]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.561 --> 02:00:13.122]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.122 --> 02:00:17.324]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.324 --> 02:00:21.367]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.389 --> 02:00:29.614]  First it's to buy alcohol, then cigarettes, then to sell metal, then to buy ammo.
[02:00:29.614 --> 02:00:39.083]  Worldwide, in 2000, a treaty was signed for world ID cards to buy and sell for the carbon tax, a global sales tax, and more.
[02:00:41.437 --> 02:00:53.388]  And the Google-type keyword tracking system is to be applied through RFID chips in all products under international law to where everything in real space and time is tracked.
[02:00:53.388 --> 02:01:00.715]  For 12 years, all new cars under international law have tracker boxes that record how fast you were driving, where you went, what you did.
[02:01:01.295 --> 02:01:07.176]  All cell phones by federal and international law track you down to just a few feet in real time.
[02:01:07.176 --> 02:01:08.237]  No warrants.
[02:01:08.237 --> 02:01:11.897]  They can dial in and listen to everything you're doing even when the phone is off.
[02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.018]  Total tyranny.
[02:01:13.018 --> 02:01:16.458]  OnStar, all of it, publicly announced.
[02:01:16.458 --> 02:01:18.899]  The entire infrastructure.
[02:01:18.899 --> 02:01:24.480]  They now have smart boxes going on homes where it can tell what power you're using, what appliances you're using.
[02:01:25.373 --> 02:01:28.356]  They're saying they're going to turn your power off when they feel like it.
[02:01:28.356 --> 02:01:32.959]  Or they're going to set the temperature in your house at above 80 for the carbon footprint.
[02:01:32.959 --> 02:01:35.221]  The entire world a giant prison.
[02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:38.824]  Now, my uncle told me this story.
[02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:41.226]  My father told me this story.
[02:01:41.226 --> 02:01:42.387]  Every major state has it.
[02:01:42.387 --> 02:01:44.529]  It's all federally and internationally written.
[02:01:44.529 --> 02:01:48.813]  When you go in to get a fishing license or a hunting license or a landowner permit,
[02:01:51.283 --> 02:02:02.705]  If you haven't paid your taxes, and it's gonna be like this for everything soon, or if you didn't pay your alimony, or you didn't pay your child support, or they say you did, they don't give you the hunting license.
[02:02:02.705 --> 02:02:06.166]  And they scan your license through a database just like you're buying a gun.
[02:02:06.166 --> 02:02:08.947]  It also registers you as a gun owner.
[02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:10.927]  And they now ask you in Texas.
[02:02:10.927 --> 02:02:14.188]  It's internationalized.
[02:02:14.188 --> 02:02:16.128]  Oh, so you shot a deer last year.
[02:02:16.128 --> 02:02:17.769]  Do you want another deer permit?
[02:02:17.769 --> 02:02:18.949]  As they're looking at your record.
[02:02:20.128 --> 02:02:26.031]  They're little secret police, and you go, that's funny, I didn't buy a deer license last year.
[02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:30.354]  Oh, that's right, you bought dove and saltwater fishing.
[02:02:30.354 --> 02:02:34.896]  Because they're waiting to hear you go, yeah, shot a big buck last year.
[02:02:34.896 --> 02:02:39.959]  See, ladies and gentlemen, they're training everyone to be spies.
[02:02:39.959 --> 02:02:46.703]  Now, Sherry in Missouri was finishing up, so they scan your license, they're looking at the computer screen, finish your story, Sherry.
[02:02:47.463 --> 02:02:48.644]  Yeah, I asked them.
[02:02:48.644 --> 02:02:54.690]  I asked them why they needed my driver's license and they said it went in a national database.
[02:02:54.690 --> 02:02:59.194]  So, you know... Total, ma'am, ma'am, people trying to buy milk now.
[02:02:59.194 --> 02:03:01.175]  They're asking for driver's license.
[02:03:01.175 --> 02:03:08.522]  And then they're going to announce, as I told people 14 years ago, a national sales tax, international sales tax, and carbon tax.
[02:03:08.522 --> 02:03:11.585]  They're already announcing it's going to be called Carbon Pass.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:15.982]  I mean, it is unbelievable the evil.
[02:03:15.982 --> 02:03:18.483]  So how did this end, Sherry?
[02:03:18.483 --> 02:03:25.888]  Well, I gave him my driver's license, I got the landowner's permit, but still, I didn't feel that was right when you own your own land.
[02:03:25.888 --> 02:03:27.629]  What's the difference if you hunt on your own land?
[02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:33.413]  Hey, my uncle, my great-uncle died a month ago, but it was his last year hunting.
[02:03:33.413 --> 02:03:40.358]  He'd had pancreatic cancer and had it removed, but it still killed him less than a year later.
[02:03:41.517 --> 02:03:44.698]  And it was his last time hunting and he pretty much knew it.
[02:03:44.698 --> 02:03:47.819]  And he had trouble walking, but we got him to the deer stand.
[02:03:47.819 --> 02:03:52.540]  And then as a landowner in Texas, you can drive somebody else's deer to the processor.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:55.261]  They were taking it to have it made into steaks and sausage.
[02:03:55.261 --> 02:04:00.082]  And in Freestone County, a county my family are founders of, you know, in the history books,
[02:04:01.142 --> 02:04:10.129]  The state police pulled my uncle over, screamed at him, treated him like filth, said, I don't care if this deer has a tag, I'm gonna arrest you and take your car and rifle.
[02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:16.213]  And my uncle said, well, I'm a landowner, I'm allowed to drive somebody else's deer, and they screamed at him.
[02:04:16.213 --> 02:04:21.517]  And then the local sheriff showed up, sheriff's deputy, and said, no, that's actually the law, he can drive it.
[02:04:21.517 --> 02:04:23.618]  And that state police cop stomped off.
[02:04:23.618 --> 02:04:25.680]  He wanted to put my uncle in prison.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:26.661]  He's a predator.
[02:04:26.661 --> 02:04:28.382]  He hates the American people.
[02:04:28.382 --> 02:04:29.483]  He loves evil.
[02:04:30.163 --> 02:04:33.325]  And we are the land of cowards, home of slaves.
[02:04:33.325 --> 02:04:35.206]  But they don't have to worry about my great-uncle anymore.
[02:04:35.206 --> 02:04:36.167]  He's dead now.
[02:04:36.167 --> 02:04:37.068]  Don't worry.
[02:04:37.068 --> 02:04:38.549]  You don't have to worry about it anymore.
[02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:40.730]  You got what you wanted, you scum.
[02:04:40.730 --> 02:04:42.591]  Sherry, I'm sorry that happened to you.
[02:04:42.591 --> 02:04:47.935]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the last two hours, coming up in this next break.
[02:04:47.935 --> 02:04:48.775]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:48.775 --> 02:04:50.657]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:50.657 --> 02:04:53.038]  Get angry about them making you a slave.
[02:04:53.038 --> 02:04:55.740]  Get angry about the globalists pushing you around.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:58.122]  Stand up and say, look, you little scumbags!
[02:04:58.122 --> 02:04:59.022]  You don't own me!
[02:04:59.022 --> 02:04:59.923]  I'm a free man!
[02:05:01.244 --> 02:05:06.831]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:05.447]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:06:05.447 --> 02:06:09.973]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:06:09.973 --> 02:06:12.256]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:06:12.256 --> 02:06:13.878]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:06:13.878 --> 02:06:14.920]  There is a solution.
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:23.565]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:07:00.029 --> 02:07:04.592]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.592 --> 02:07:05.492]  Number one.
[02:07:05.492 --> 02:07:08.934]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.934 --> 02:07:09.775]  Number two.
[02:07:09.775 --> 02:07:14.677]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.677 --> 02:07:15.418]  It's true.
[02:07:15.418 --> 02:07:20.281]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.281 --> 02:07:20.821]  Number three.
[02:07:21.101 --> 02:07:24.684]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.684 --> 02:07:29.407]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.407 --> 02:07:32.169]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.169 --> 02:07:36.632]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.632 --> 02:07:40.775]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.775 --> 02:07:45.559]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.839 --> 02:07:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.780]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:54.041]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.041 --> 02:08:02.183]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:02.183 --> 02:08:08.824]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.824 --> 02:08:11.785]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.543 --> 02:08:21.385]  We are simulcasting the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:08:21.385 --> 02:08:29.467]  Every day the radio show converts at the halfway point, sometimes earlier, to television via PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:08:29.467 --> 02:08:31.648]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:32.788 --> 02:08:39.053]  I have the webmaster and the head of an excellent website, Cryptome.org, John Young, joining us next hour.
[02:08:39.053 --> 02:08:44.698]  I meant to get into this subject later in the show, how Google, Yahoo, they all surveil you.
[02:08:44.698 --> 02:08:46.900]  It all goes instantly to the government.
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:48.621]  There are no warrants.
[02:08:48.621 --> 02:08:49.842]  It's all completely illegal.
[02:08:50.783 --> 02:09:00.026]  I pulled up articles out of USA Today that when you order a pizza, it's run through a criminal database to see if you have a warrant, because they know you're giving your real name and credit card.
[02:09:00.026 --> 02:09:01.507]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[02:09:01.507 --> 02:09:03.507]  Everyone put through these grids.
[02:09:03.507 --> 02:09:07.809]  This is being run by the criminal government.
[02:09:07.809 --> 02:09:12.410]  Goldman Sachs, according to Bloomberg, is arming itself with weapons against the public.
[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:18.012]  Northcom and Homeland Security's number one enemy, according to their own documents, is the American people.
[02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:24.288]  Gun owners, veterans, conservatives, this is what you expect from a criminal, rogue government.
[02:09:24.288 --> 02:09:27.191]  A private, corporate takeover is happening.
[02:09:27.191 --> 02:09:44.985]  This is the first day of the Copenhagen, Denmark, United Nations Climate Change Conference, December 7th and December 18th, as they ratify open world government, in the words of the head of the EU and the UN, Ban Ki-moon and Herman Van Rompuy and Al Gore and many others.
[02:09:44.985 --> 02:09:47.647]  In fact, I want to cue those clips up again and play those later in the hour.
[02:09:48.396 --> 02:10:01.860]  Now, I had meant to just take calls and go over the latest on ClimateGate, this open world government being established, what's in the treaty, whether Obama's going to sign on, he will sign on.
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:06.081]  Then they've got to ratify it through the Senate that probably will pass this year or next.
[02:10:06.081 --> 02:10:14.383]  The problem is, even if it doesn't pass, the states, this is worldwide, all the sub-regions, are already implementing the carbon system.
[02:10:15.287 --> 02:10:21.451]  The EPA, in line with that, has announced today they are going to list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[02:10:21.451 --> 02:10:37.260]  The average 160-pound homo sapien sapien, human being, that's you and I, puts off five and a half pounds of carbon dioxide a day that plants then respirate from, thus producing oxygen and completing the carbon cycle on the planet.
[02:10:38.905 --> 02:10:41.346]  Carbon, of course, has been 14 to 20 times higher.
[02:10:41.346 --> 02:10:43.948]  Carbon dioxide in the past, it is a life-giving gas.
[02:10:43.948 --> 02:10:46.409]  The earth is actually carbon dioxide starved.
[02:10:46.409 --> 02:10:52.272]  The globalists chose this as a tax because it allows them to have an iron grip over all industry, all human activity.
[02:10:52.272 --> 02:11:06.239]  In the words of the head UN biodiversity chief, Maurice Strong, to quote, shut down all industrial society and make humankind the enemy of the global government.
[02:11:07.318 --> 02:11:12.621]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this evil.
[02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:24.529]  Now, I opened the phones up and we've taken more than 10 calls of people all over the country going to gun shows, told, give us your driver's license, they scan, give us your social security, some scan it, some just write it down.
[02:11:25.714 --> 02:11:27.376]  Walmart doing it.
[02:11:27.376 --> 02:11:30.340]  The feds have ordered this outside of law.
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:31.761]  They're just ordering it.
[02:11:31.761 --> 02:11:33.764]  It's unified nationwide.
[02:11:33.764 --> 02:11:37.108]  People are sending in the reports of the names of the gun shows.
[02:11:37.108 --> 02:11:45.517]  I've known this is happening for a year, but I'm so busy on other issues I hadn't really covered it on air, and it took a caller mentioning it that ignited my anger.
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:48.421]  This is illegitimate, it's illegal.
[02:11:48.421 --> 02:11:52.562]  I need stories from Kurt Nemo on this ASAP.
[02:11:52.562 --> 02:12:01.925]  Again, we just went live at TV, but if you go to the podcast at InfoWars.com and subscribe to it, or the restreams, or if your local AM and FM re-airs the show, most carry it live.
[02:12:01.925 --> 02:12:09.807]  In that entire second hour, I took call, after call, after call, naming the gun shows where this has happened.
[02:12:09.807 --> 02:12:12.008]  And I've already confirmed it's going on.
[02:12:12.008 --> 02:12:15.069]  It's just good to actually hear it from the people.
[02:12:15.953 --> 02:12:18.714]  The government just orders the gun shows to do it.
[02:12:18.714 --> 02:12:19.774]  No law.
[02:12:19.774 --> 02:12:23.095]  They're just intimidated by the BATF goons to do it.
[02:12:23.095 --> 02:12:24.876]  It is absolutely devastating.
[02:12:24.876 --> 02:12:32.579]  Let's take one more call on that subject, then we're going to shut down my phone system and only open on special occasions and go back to the Genesis calls.
[02:12:32.579 --> 02:12:38.681]  For everybody that's holding, perhaps Genesis can give me a new call list, because those calls have been holding for a while.
[02:12:39.833 --> 02:12:43.436]  A fresh call list so I can make sure I'm going to callers that are actually there.
[02:12:43.436 --> 02:12:47.359]  I appreciate the Genesis phone calls for holding while I went over all that.
[02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:51.722]  But let's get through a bunch of your calls right now.
[02:12:51.722 --> 02:12:53.904]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim in Utah.
[02:12:53.904 --> 02:12:55.985]  Jim, what's your story?
[02:12:55.985 --> 02:13:04.531]  Well, my story is in Price, Utah, I went to Kmart to do some Christmas shopping and filled up a buggy full of merchandise.
[02:13:04.531 --> 02:13:07.954]  Went to buy my son a .22 rifle.
[02:13:07.954 --> 02:13:09.155]  Noticed there was no guns.
[02:13:09.704 --> 02:13:14.306]  So I asked the service person, what was their 22 rifles?
[02:13:14.306 --> 02:13:28.714]  And they told me that the Kmart's have chosen not to sell the American people guns or ammunition or archery or any of that anymore.
[02:13:28.714 --> 02:13:33.176]  Yeah, that happened with Rosie O'Donnell originally.
[02:13:33.176 --> 02:13:38.679]  She called for them to stop selling guns and they did a few years after that.
[02:13:38.679 --> 02:13:39.019]  But, uh,
[02:13:41.141 --> 02:13:45.124]  Did you hear all the callers who were having to get a driver's license to buy ammo?
[02:13:45.124 --> 02:13:58.273]  Yeah, I went into Walmart and was going to buy ammunition, and they had a clipboard there, and the first question out of their mouth was, is this for a handgun or a rifle?
[02:13:58.273 --> 02:14:04.538]  And I asked them why they needed to know, and they said before they could sell it to me, that's the question they had to ask.
[02:14:06.658 --> 02:14:12.343]  And then every Walmart in the country takes your driver's license and scans it.
[02:14:12.343 --> 02:14:14.384]  Did they ask for that?
[02:14:14.384 --> 02:14:15.945]  You know, it didn't even get to that point.
[02:14:15.945 --> 02:14:19.648]  I told them if I had to do all that, I wasn't going to live like a slave.
[02:14:19.648 --> 02:14:26.334]  And in both cases, I left both buggies of merchandise for them to restock themselves.
[02:14:26.334 --> 02:14:30.357]  So anybody, you know, if they're not going to sell us guns and ammo, I say go somewhere else and shop.
[02:14:30.357 --> 02:14:32.338]  Well, I hear you and God bless you, Jim.
[02:14:32.338 --> 02:14:33.079]  Here's what's happening.
[02:14:34.534 --> 02:14:37.735]  They can't pass the gun laws they want federally, though they're trying.
[02:14:37.735 --> 02:14:44.558]  They've got gun laws where the BATF can recommend to the Attorney General and he can ban any guns he wants.
[02:14:44.558 --> 02:14:46.059]  It just gives him imperial power.
[02:14:46.059 --> 02:14:48.319]  That bill's got co-sponsors right now.
[02:14:48.319 --> 02:14:50.160]  They've got the no-fly, no-buy.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.161]  No judge, no jury, no conviction, no arrest, no indictment.
[02:14:53.161 --> 02:14:54.722]  They won't tell you how you got on the list.
[02:14:54.722 --> 02:14:56.063]  You can't get off the list.
[02:14:56.063 --> 02:14:58.043]  They just say you can't buy a gun anymore.
[02:14:58.043 --> 02:15:00.844]  They're already doing that, even though the bill hadn't passed.
[02:15:00.844 --> 02:15:01.845]  That's already been implemented.
[02:15:03.168 --> 02:15:11.957]  But in California and many other states, Texas has already tried this, they make you thumbprint and register to buy ammo every time you buy ammo.
[02:15:11.957 --> 02:15:20.727]  But where they can't get it passed as a law, the BATF comes in, and I've seen them do it, with shaved heads and little mafia mustaches or goatees.
[02:15:20.727 --> 02:15:22.428]  I mean, they look like guys right out of...
[02:15:23.089 --> 02:15:29.772]  If I was casting for a Hollywood movie and wanted criminals, I would go hire BATF because they just look like real criminals.
[02:15:29.772 --> 02:15:32.913]  A vapor of evil comes off of them.
[02:15:32.913 --> 02:15:34.394]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:34.394 --> 02:15:38.415]  And they come in and they go, looks like you spelled this guy's name wrong.
[02:15:38.415 --> 02:15:46.299]  They'll go through 5,000 forms and find one spot where you didn't dot an I. And they'll say, I got you for fraud with firearms sales.
[02:15:46.299 --> 02:15:47.879]  This is how they shut down most of the gun shops.
[02:15:47.879 --> 02:15:49.120]  And they'll say, or...
[02:15:51.414 --> 02:15:58.542]  You start getting social security numbers anybody that buys ammo or buys a cleaning kit and I won't put you in prison.
[02:15:58.542 --> 02:16:05.129]  You work for me now punk and they'll sit there and wet their pants and roll over and America dies by a million cuts.
[02:16:06.357 --> 02:16:08.158]  And this is how they run America.
[02:16:08.158 --> 02:16:13.619]  And they go in those gun shows and they say, one old man sold three rifles in one month here.
[02:16:13.619 --> 02:16:15.520]  We think that's firearms trafficking.
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.101]  Even though they're legally allowed to sell the guns, we're going to say you're allowing trafficking.
[02:16:19.101 --> 02:16:26.523]  We're going to indict this gun show for felonies unless you let us put surveillance cameras in and you get social security numbers from everybody.
[02:16:26.523 --> 02:16:28.184]  Do you understand?
[02:16:28.184 --> 02:16:32.845]  And, you know, the decadent, weak gun shop owners are like, I don't care about the Second Amendment.
[02:16:32.845 --> 02:16:33.785]  I just want money.
[02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:35.446]  Hell, I'll help you put everybody in prison.
[02:16:36.707 --> 02:16:37.749]  I'll do what you say!
[02:16:37.749 --> 02:16:38.470]  I'll do it right now!
[02:16:39.906 --> 02:16:47.912]  And that's how America dies and quietly the secret police are recruiting the kids and brainwashing them and having them write dossiers on their parents nationwide.
[02:16:47.912 --> 02:16:55.617]  And the police are taking blood without warrants on the side of the road and they're questioning people's kids and taking them in and doing strip searches whenever they want.
[02:16:55.617 --> 02:16:58.359]  And they're forcibly inoculating kids all over the country.
[02:16:58.359 --> 02:17:01.902]  When the parents get mad, they say, shut up, we're gonna do what we want.
[02:17:01.902 --> 02:17:08.807]  And the government's just practicing criminality, practicing evil, practicing oppression, practicing dominating everyone.
[02:17:10.652 --> 02:17:22.079]  Just like more than half a million women from 1922 to 1987, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, were taken and had their uteruses cut out.
[02:17:24.093 --> 02:17:25.875]  They didn't just tie their tubes.
[02:17:25.875 --> 02:17:30.839]  They removed the entire uterus because it had an added soft kill and would debilitate a lot of them.
[02:17:30.839 --> 02:17:31.820]  That's added fun.
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:38.065]  44% of Native American women were sterilized from 1970 to 1975 alone.
[02:17:38.065 --> 02:17:39.326]  They weren't in any type of health care.
[02:17:39.326 --> 02:17:41.147]  They weren't told what the procedure was.
[02:17:41.147 --> 02:17:43.750]  They were just knocked out and sterilized.
[02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:45.291]  That's what this government is.
[02:17:45.291 --> 02:17:47.172]  They're putting drugs in your water.
[02:17:47.172 --> 02:17:48.433]  They're sterilizing you.
[02:17:48.433 --> 02:17:50.395]  They're giving your children bone cancer.
[02:17:50.395 --> 02:17:50.996]  They admit it.
[02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:57.212]  They brag that you're animals and stupid and that there's nothing you can do to stop them.
[02:17:57.212 --> 02:17:57.772]  They love it.
[02:17:57.772 --> 02:18:01.553]  And these government bureaucrats love giving their kids big glasses of fluoride.
[02:18:01.553 --> 02:18:03.393]  It's a giggling, demonic spirit.
[02:18:03.393 --> 02:18:04.714]  They always laugh about it.
[02:18:04.714 --> 02:18:11.296]  You tell one of these evil servants of tyranny about how they're being hurt by the system, they'll just giggle and give you this little piggy smile is what I call it.
[02:18:11.296 --> 02:18:13.537]  And it's just a spirit of submission to evil.
[02:18:13.537 --> 02:18:17.538]  As long as they can hurt people under them, they don't mind if they're getting hurt from those on top.
[02:18:18.098 --> 02:18:19.859]  It's all about just cowardice.
[02:18:19.859 --> 02:18:24.402]  A lot of people are scared of evil and scared of darkness and scared of the power of evil.
[02:18:24.402 --> 02:18:28.345]  And so at a subconscious level, they decide to join it and serve it.
[02:18:28.345 --> 02:18:29.966]  And that's why we're an evil people.
[02:18:29.966 --> 02:18:39.472]  We wear skulls and death and murder and the trappings and the symbols of our nation are all the colors and symbols of the Nazis and the Soviets.
[02:18:39.472 --> 02:18:42.494]  And death and destruction is what we love.
[02:18:42.494 --> 02:18:47.558]  And because we're just being bathed and prepared for the feast, we're being washed and scrubbed and
[02:18:48.258 --> 02:19:06.510]  Brought out on a silver pallet to the devils to literally tear us to pieces and the globals will do what they did in the Soviet Union and in Maoist China and Nazi Germany they're just gonna murder and kill and slaughter and torture children and the whole grid is in place and they're just, yes, our great time of murder is almost here!
[02:19:06.510 --> 02:19:08.351]  We've always hated America!
[02:19:08.351 --> 02:19:10.212]  We've got secret police in place!
[02:19:10.212 --> 02:19:11.773]  They're ready to wage war!
[02:19:11.773 --> 02:19:14.435]  The public's lost their spirit to stand up!
[02:19:14.435 --> 02:19:16.076]  Soon the murder will begin!
[02:19:16.516 --> 02:19:21.943]  It's not enough that we CPS and kill the kids in many cases and test radiation on foster children.
[02:19:21.943 --> 02:19:28.712]  It's not enough that we radiate and spray nerve gas on the troops and Project Shed and kill thousands and maim thousands.
[02:19:28.712 --> 02:19:33.979]  It's not enough that we put HIV in the Factor VIII drug product to give over a million people HIV.
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:37.121]  It's not enough we put hundreds of chemicals in the water.
[02:19:37.121 --> 02:19:41.581]  It's not enough that 20% of the population's on Prozac, literally eating holes in their brains.
[02:19:41.581 --> 02:19:46.122]  It's not enough we're feeding them GMO that sterilizes all the rodents when they test it on them.
[02:19:46.122 --> 02:19:47.062]  It doesn't matter!
[02:19:47.062 --> 02:19:48.543]  That's all just the setup!
[02:19:48.543 --> 02:19:50.363]  This country's ready to be raped!
[02:19:50.363 --> 02:19:51.783]  It's ready to be slaughtered!
[02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:53.924]  Our power is about to be released!
[02:19:53.924 --> 02:19:55.384]  Oh, please, Satan!
[02:19:55.384 --> 02:19:57.764]  Release us to kill the American people!
[02:19:57.764 --> 02:19:59.925]  They are ready for us to drink their blood!
[02:19:59.925 --> 02:20:00.805]  To bathe in their blood!
[02:20:00.905 --> 02:20:01.125]  We're good!
[02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:21.210]  I think so.
[02:20:43.886 --> 02:20:44.347]  I think so.
[02:21:00.845 --> 02:21:08.591]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:21:08.591 --> 02:21:14.675]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:14.675 --> 02:21:17.637]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:21:17.637 --> 02:21:19.999]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do
[02:21:20.179 --> 02:21:20.459]  We're good.
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:37.421]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:37.421 --> 02:21:39.961]  The economy is bad, but it's probably gonna get worse.
[02:21:39.961 --> 02:21:44.683]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:44.683 --> 02:21:48.384]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:21:48.384 --> 02:21:51.505]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:51.505 --> 02:21:53.405]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:53.405 --> 02:21:55.526]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:22:00.856 --> 02:22:03.057]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.057 --> 02:22:03.777]  December 7th, 2009.
[02:22:03.777 --> 02:22:04.858]  Gold opened this morning at $1144.70.
[02:22:04.858 --> 02:22:07.819]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1175.75, $587.88 for a half ounce, or $293.94 for the quarter ounce.
[02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:08.400]  That's $1175.75, $587.88, and $293.94.
[02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:34.079]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:34.079 --> 02:22:42.667]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:42.927 --> 02:22:44.009]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:44.009 --> 02:22:48.354]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:22:48.354 --> 02:22:49.456]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.456 --> 02:22:51.318]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:22:51.318 --> 02:22:51.559]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.559 --> 02:22:51.859]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.523 --> 02:23:01.184]  Hello.
[02:23:01.184 --> 02:23:05.948]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[02:23:05.948 --> 02:23:10.772]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[02:23:10.772 --> 02:23:15.556]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:23:15.816 --> 02:23:20.501]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[02:23:20.501 --> 02:23:24.745]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[02:23:24.745 --> 02:23:29.089]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[02:23:29.089 --> 02:23:33.634]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[02:23:33.634 --> 02:23:35.536]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[02:23:35.896 --> 02:23:37.877]  I can't say enough about this book.
[02:23:37.877 --> 02:23:39.778]  Blessings to you and your family.
[02:23:39.778 --> 02:23:45.501]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[02:23:45.501 --> 02:23:48.903]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:23:48.903 --> 02:23:52.505]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:23:52.505 --> 02:23:56.847]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:24:04.889 --> 02:24:26.095]  To talk about how widespread this is, I can open the phones up and take unlimited calls for four hours, giving each caller one minute, where they go to gun shows, you name it, just to get in the door after you pay your money, give us your driver's license, give us your social security number, Walmart doing it to buy ammo, and Aaron saw the bill, everybody's calling, they show you a bill,
[02:24:26.775 --> 02:24:27.155]  That has to
[02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:48.823]  Uh, social security number because of child support bill, blah, blah, blah.
[02:24:48.823 --> 02:24:49.584]  It's like U.S.
[02:24:49.584 --> 02:24:52.445]  Code 42-666.
[02:24:52.445 --> 02:24:53.345]  I said, that's weird.
[02:24:53.345 --> 02:24:55.686]  I don't want to give my social security number.
[02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:57.926]  And I pointed at it and the employee kind of laughed.
[02:24:57.926 --> 02:24:59.527]  He's like, yeah, that is weird.
[02:24:59.527 --> 02:25:00.947]  He didn't end up taking my number.
[02:25:00.947 --> 02:25:03.568]  But then again, it's probably in that system already anyway.
[02:25:04.821 --> 02:25:09.883]  But it's kind of freaky, you know, because they talk about Mark of the Beast and there it is in the bill number.
[02:25:09.883 --> 02:25:12.324]  Well, you know, the law says they can give a license.
[02:25:12.324 --> 02:25:16.105]  It's illegal under the Privacy Act of 86 to ask for Social Security.
[02:25:16.105 --> 02:25:17.706]  So as soon as you said no, he didn't make you?
[02:25:18.191 --> 02:25:19.191]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:19.191 --> 02:25:21.452]  See how it's all just color of law?
[02:25:21.452 --> 02:25:22.993]  And it was never supposed to be for identification.
[02:25:22.993 --> 02:25:36.299]  By the way, Clinton signed an executive order in 1997, this is in my film, no, 1994, but the film's in 1997 when I got arrested refusing a thumb scan, and I handed out the executive order where they said they're going to take blood and urine at the DMVs.
[02:25:36.299 --> 02:25:45.503]  Now, they never implemented that, but now they're taking blood at checkpoints, and they've admitted, oh, at birth we take every baby's blood for an illegal DNA database.
[02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:47.064]  Is that the right bill, Jaron Pernodoff?
[02:25:47.064 --> 02:25:47.484]  I don't think so.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:52.701]  Well, the point is, we need to dig that up, and we need to go in there with a camera to Walmart and show people that.
[02:25:52.701 --> 02:25:54.222]  Yeah, it was posted right there.
[02:25:54.222 --> 02:25:57.543]  I pointed right at it, and the guy was like, wow, you know, it does say 666.
[02:25:57.543 --> 02:25:59.764]  I mean, everyone knows.
[02:25:59.764 --> 02:26:09.927]  Well, have you ever noticed, most bills are boring, but if you just go to thomas.loc.gov and type in HR666 or S666, it's always some really evil bill.
[02:26:09.927 --> 02:26:11.907]  It's like a little joke with these guys.
[02:26:11.907 --> 02:26:12.227]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:18.214]  But I mean, who would want to be associated with that number, knowing what it's associated with?
[02:26:18.214 --> 02:26:23.960]  And then it always is, every time you have to imprint or give your ID or, you know, embrace the government system, basically.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.523]  Well, you know, the barcode's algorithm is based on a key of 666.
[02:26:27.523 --> 02:26:29.605]  And I heard that like 12 years ago and didn't believe it.
[02:26:29.605 --> 02:26:32.989]  Then I had the inventor of the barcode on and read papers on it.
[02:26:32.989 --> 02:26:35.031]  The key code used to make it work is it's based on a 666.
[02:26:37.762 --> 02:26:45.305]  Yeah, well, you know, it's real close to two-thirds in math, so... Well, that's why the Egyptians had it as the calculation in their temples to the sun.
[02:26:45.305 --> 02:26:45.666]  It was 666.
[02:26:45.666 --> 02:26:48.627]  So, yeah, it's the sun god calculation.
[02:26:48.627 --> 02:26:50.028]  Yeah, but... It's like 33.
[02:26:50.028 --> 02:26:54.390]  To have it associated with the... See, 666 is a doubling of 33.
[02:26:54.390 --> 02:26:56.110]  And 33 is pi.
[02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:57.271]  Right, yeah.
[02:26:57.271 --> 02:26:58.792]  That's thirds, repeating six.
[02:26:58.792 --> 02:27:00.933]  Yeah, so that, I mean, let you have an understanding.
[02:27:00.933 --> 02:27:03.994]  That's the number that this system works with computers on.
[02:27:03.994 --> 02:27:05.635]  How'd they know that 2,000 years ago, Aaron?
[02:27:06.298 --> 02:27:10.281]  I can't answer that for you, but it's strange.
[02:27:10.281 --> 02:27:14.824]  But they shouldn't be associating that with... It's just telling us we're slaves.
[02:27:14.824 --> 02:27:19.327]  Anyone who can read that number knows what it means.
[02:27:19.327 --> 02:27:19.747]  666.
[02:27:19.747 --> 02:27:22.389]  Hey, you ought to take a still camera.
[02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:27.252]  I think the little cameras are gone right now with the crew, but we need to buy some more little hidden cameras.
[02:27:27.252 --> 02:27:30.754]  And we need to get in there.
[02:27:30.754 --> 02:27:32.235]  People don't know this is going on.
[02:27:32.235 --> 02:27:33.036]  They don't understand.
[02:27:35.069 --> 02:27:35.709]  It's real, though.
[02:27:35.709 --> 02:27:40.192]  I saw it in Walmart, which is already like Mark of the Beast Land.
[02:27:40.192 --> 02:27:43.413]  How was your trip to Florida to interview Dr. Paul Craig Roberts?
[02:27:43.413 --> 02:27:43.873]  Oh, it's nice.
[02:27:43.873 --> 02:27:47.335]  He knows so much, you know, and he's getting sick of the tyranny, I think.
[02:27:47.335 --> 02:27:48.356]  You think so, maybe?
[02:27:48.356 --> 02:27:50.837]  He seems fed up with it, yeah.
[02:27:50.837 --> 02:27:52.858]  Maybe he's evil.
[02:27:52.858 --> 02:27:54.459]  Maybe Homeland Security, maybe we're all bad.
[02:27:54.459 --> 02:27:56.500]  Maybe the government's really good, Aaron.
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:59.381]  Maybe they're doing this all for our safety, Aaron.
[02:27:59.381 --> 02:28:02.323]  DynCorp and Halliburton running the child kidnapping rings publicly.
[02:28:02.323 --> 02:28:02.903]  Yeah, it must be.
[02:28:04.141 --> 02:28:05.702]  Yeah, they're doing it for everyone's safety.
[02:28:05.702 --> 02:28:08.683]  666.
[02:28:08.683 --> 02:28:12.524]  Again, that's for your safety.
[02:28:12.524 --> 02:28:15.745]  It's for your safety, Aaron.
[02:28:15.745 --> 02:28:16.786]  It just creeps me out.
[02:28:16.786 --> 02:28:18.966]  I mean, it really does.
[02:28:18.966 --> 02:28:21.167]  I don't want to deal with these people anyway.
[02:28:21.167 --> 02:28:28.150]  And now they've announced, the head of the UN and Al Gore and all of them announced, oh, it's a global religion we're launching and you must be part of it.
[02:28:29.669 --> 02:28:31.450]  I mean, you can't make this up!
[02:28:31.450 --> 02:28:32.711]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:28:32.711 --> 02:28:35.552]  The churches are on the government payroll, almost all of them.
[02:28:35.552 --> 02:28:37.733]  Total tyranny is coming in.
[02:28:37.733 --> 02:28:43.656]  I'm going to come back and go to calls, and then I'm getting into the latest climate change development, where they openly have been caught in more fraud.
[02:28:43.656 --> 02:28:49.599]  More fraud is coming out with NASA, NOAA, all the other atmospheric research centers involved in the fraud.
[02:28:49.599 --> 02:28:51.180]  Total criminality coming out.
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:55.882]  And they're saying, we don't care, we're still going to ratify the treaty, which the U.S.
[02:28:55.882 --> 02:29:01.704]  can't get out of unless a unanimous vote by 190-something signatures.
[02:29:01.704 --> 02:29:03.005]  That's not good.
[02:29:03.005 --> 02:29:05.986]  Does that sound like freedom, where your country can't get out of it?
[02:29:05.986 --> 02:29:10.227]  Just like the United Nations treaty, where everything's backwards to our Constitution.
[02:29:10.227 --> 02:29:13.249]  Yeah, well it gives you 29 great freedoms.
[02:29:13.249 --> 02:29:13.609]  Gives you.
[02:29:14.372 --> 02:29:22.154]  It says, oh, we give you this, whereas our Bill of Rights points out our inalienable, God-given rights as a free, sentient being in the universe.
[02:29:22.154 --> 02:29:27.496]  Their system says, then in Article 2930, oh, by the way, you have none of these rights when we say.
[02:29:27.496 --> 02:29:32.018]  But most of their so-called rights are your right to be subjected to their eugenic system.
[02:29:32.018 --> 02:29:35.659]  And see, you hear them wanting to ban Christmas music in malls, that's the new thing?
[02:29:35.659 --> 02:29:37.579]  It's just about them setting the precedent.
[02:29:37.579 --> 02:29:39.640]  Like, no, we give you the culture we want.
[02:29:41.929 --> 02:29:43.951]  And it's all about getting everyone at each other's throats.
[02:29:43.951 --> 02:29:45.873]  Thank you, Aaron.
[02:29:45.873 --> 02:29:48.456]  It's very unusual that you didn't like Bill 666.
[02:29:48.456 --> 02:29:51.079]  You should have submitted.
[02:29:51.079 --> 02:29:52.480]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:55.023]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.023 --> 02:29:57.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.158 --> 02:30:04.159]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.159 --> 02:30:09.482]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.482 --> 02:30:11.542]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.542 --> 02:30:16.545]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.545 --> 02:30:17.725]  How much do you want?
[02:30:17.725 --> 02:30:18.846]  When do you want it?
[02:30:18.846 --> 02:30:20.746]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:20.746 --> 02:30:21.807]  When will you need it?
[02:30:21.807 --> 02:30:24.008]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.008 --> 02:30:25.348]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.348 --> 02:30:26.649]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:26.869 --> 02:30:32.134]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.134 --> 02:30:35.718]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:35.718 --> 02:30:39.542]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.542 --> 02:30:40.783]  How much will you need?
[02:30:40.783 --> 02:30:41.664]  We don't know.
[02:30:41.664 --> 02:30:42.765]  How much do you want?
[02:30:42.765 --> 02:30:43.526]  All you can get.
[02:30:43.526 --> 02:30:44.507]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:44.787 --> 02:30:47.830]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:49.612]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:49.612 --> 02:30:50.532]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.154 --> 02:31:05.461]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.461 --> 02:31:10.007]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.007 --> 02:31:12.290]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:13.912]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:13.912 --> 02:31:14.934]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.154 --> 02:31:23.599]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:31:23.599 --> 02:31:31.043]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:31:37.087 --> 02:31:42.670]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:31:43.090 --> 02:31:47.255]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:32:00.046 --> 02:32:07.030]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:09.111]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:32:09.111 --> 02:32:11.353]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:11.353 --> 02:32:13.014]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:32:49.814 --> 02:32:50.774]  Come, you masters of war.
[02:32:50.774 --> 02:32:51.735]  Here to build the big guns.
[02:33:12.700 --> 02:33:30.195]  Okay, I've done two hours and 33 minutes here and haven't plugged sponsors or any of the things that fund this operation.
[02:33:31.667 --> 02:33:38.792]  But more importantly, the stuff that funds our operation is also the information that blows the New World Order sky high.
[02:33:38.792 --> 02:33:46.898]  So I want to encourage all of the listeners to not procrastinate and to order Fall of the Republic on DVD, my greatest film.
[02:33:47.739 --> 02:33:51.261]  America's last stand, make the choice liberty or tyranny.
[02:33:51.261 --> 02:33:55.022]  Follow the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[02:33:55.022 --> 02:33:56.483]  economy by design.
[02:33:56.483 --> 02:34:01.985]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[02:34:01.985 --> 02:34:05.047]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[02:34:05.047 --> 02:34:10.509]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[02:34:10.509 --> 02:34:11.770]  president to chair the world body.
[02:34:12.311 --> 02:34:18.505]  A scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[02:34:18.505 --> 02:34:21.312]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[02:34:22.478 --> 02:34:33.005]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[02:34:33.005 --> 02:34:36.587]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[02:34:36.587 --> 02:34:42.150]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:47.393]  This film reveals the architecture of the new world order and why the power elite have in store for humanity.
[02:34:47.393 --> 02:34:51.236]  More importantly, it communicates how we the people can retake control of our government,
[02:34:51.556 --> 02:34:54.438]  Turn the criminal tide and bring the tyrants to justice.
[02:34:54.438 --> 02:35:00.002]  When you get Fall of the Republic until Christmas, you can get the Obama Joker t-shirt.
[02:35:00.002 --> 02:35:02.004]  When those are sold out, they're sold out.
[02:35:02.004 --> 02:35:08.029]  Or you can get the Don't Tread on Me, Join or Die variant t-shirts.
[02:35:08.029 --> 02:35:10.230]  We have several different selections there.
[02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:17.316]  I added those because some of the Obama shirts in certain sizes are selling out, so if you can't get that, you can get at least the other shirt, which I think is one of my other favorites.
[02:35:18.522 --> 02:35:24.469]  Available at InfoWars.com, and your purchase supports this operation that we're trying to expand against the globalists.
[02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:26.811]  888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to call.
[02:35:26.811 --> 02:35:26.891]  888-253-3139.
[02:35:26.891 --> 02:35:29.474]  And until Christmas, we've done this every year for almost six years.
[02:35:36.502 --> 02:35:40.067]  PrisonPlanet.tv, five and a half months free.
[02:35:40.067 --> 02:35:43.813]  So you pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free on the yearly membership.
[02:35:43.813 --> 02:35:50.903]  So instead of $5.95 a month, it comes down to three something, I forget the exact math, a month when you sign up in the...
[02:35:52.265 --> 02:35:55.667]  Month of December at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:55.667 --> 02:35:57.648]  The live TV show slash radio show.
[02:35:57.648 --> 02:35:59.309]  All my films in the highest quality.
[02:35:59.309 --> 02:36:00.710]  The films premiere there first.
[02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:03.671]  Expanded extras just for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:36:03.671 --> 02:36:06.813]  The behind-the-scenes interview with Dave Mustaine who's become a Christian.
[02:36:06.813 --> 02:36:07.814]  Woken up to the New World Order.
[02:36:07.814 --> 02:36:09.935]  His new album's titled after my film Endgame.
[02:36:11.015 --> 02:36:12.636]  We did that interview with him behind the scenes.
[02:36:12.636 --> 02:36:16.859]  It'll be about 30 minutes long, coming up Wednesday for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:36:16.859 --> 02:36:23.904]  We're going to premiere it live on the streams here at PrisonPlanet.tv, so definitely take advantage of that.
[02:36:23.904 --> 02:36:28.767]  And I wanted to tell you about one of our other sponsors, and then go to your calls, and then into ClimateGate, the Copenhagen meeting.
[02:36:28.767 --> 02:36:31.849]  Did you guys cue up Lord Von Rompey?
[02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:33.070]  Von Rompey?
[02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:36.032]  The clip where he's calling for global government?
[02:36:36.032 --> 02:36:40.575]  If you need to, Craig knows where that is, so pull that up where he calls for global government.
[02:36:41.495 --> 02:36:44.937]  And also I want to cue up Al Gore calling for global governance.
[02:36:44.937 --> 02:36:45.897]  We'll have to stop there.
[02:36:45.897 --> 02:36:47.938]  There's so many of these clips.
[02:36:47.938 --> 02:36:52.180]  But for new listeners, I want to be able to play that coming up here a little bit later.
[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:54.261]  I also want to tell you about Ecolablue.
[02:36:54.261 --> 02:36:58.423]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[02:36:58.423 --> 02:37:00.403]  Now this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:37:00.403 --> 02:37:04.525]  Our sponsor Ecolablue with the Ecolablue 28 machine will allow you to do just that.
[02:37:04.525 --> 02:37:06.686]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons a day of water.
[02:37:08.787 --> 02:37:17.835]  The water once generated passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques, ensuring you know exactly what you're drinking.
[02:37:17.835 --> 02:37:19.656]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[02:37:19.656 --> 02:37:21.698]  We spend so much time talking about on this show.
[02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:32.026]  Get your very own source of unlimited, renewable drinking water for you and your family today by visiting them on the web at acolablue.com or by clicking on their banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[02:37:32.026 --> 02:37:32.066]  800-691-6043.
[02:37:45.086 --> 02:37:54.292]  Now, let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[02:37:54.292 --> 02:37:56.954]  Let's talk to Zach in Canada.
[02:37:56.954 --> 02:38:00.196]  Zach, welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:38:00.196 --> 02:38:01.457]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[02:38:01.457 --> 02:38:02.598]  Good.
[02:38:02.598 --> 02:38:06.440]  Hey man, I just want to thank you for waking me up at 22 years old.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.582]  I have a new lease on life now.
[02:38:08.582 --> 02:38:10.403]  My first question, my first suggestion,
[02:38:12.487 --> 02:38:15.889]  Then a question is, you should get this guy, his name is Jack Van Impey.
[02:38:15.889 --> 02:38:18.031]  He talks about the New World Order, a Christian guy.
[02:38:18.031 --> 02:38:23.414]  I think he talks on a Christian station.
[02:38:23.414 --> 02:38:24.375]  His name is Jack Van Impey.
[02:38:24.375 --> 02:38:39.785]  My question is, I hear about all this world government and it's apparent, it's obvious that it's coming, but my question is, you talk about this one world religion that they talk about.
[02:38:39.785 --> 02:38:41.666]  My question is, who do you think
[02:38:42.322 --> 02:38:48.383]  Uh, would be the head of this, uh, one world religion.
[02:38:48.383 --> 02:38:49.863]  Expand on that?
[02:38:49.863 --> 02:39:02.906]  Like, um, the Bible would call it the Antichrist, um, my question is, like, who do you see, like, I mean, not even, not even biblically speaking, um, who do you see as kind of being groomed to be the head of it?
[02:39:02.906 --> 02:39:07.406]  Would you rule out Prince Charles, or?
[02:39:07.406 --> 02:39:10.227]  Well, regardless, it's world government, and
[02:39:11.257 --> 02:39:22.065]  People make the parallels of Revelation, a world religion being announced by the UN and the EU, a global system where all human activity is tracked and traced and controlled.
[02:39:22.065 --> 02:39:26.288]  It's just a hellish system that's being set up.
[02:39:26.288 --> 02:39:33.974]  My suggestion is that, I don't know if you guys would get that guy on, Jackson Impey, but he seems to know what he's talking about.
[02:39:33.974 --> 02:39:35.295]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[02:39:35.295 --> 02:39:36.776]  You know, I'm not here to bash people.
[02:39:38.049 --> 02:39:41.292]  You know, Jack Van Impey says Al Qaeda's real and 9-11's real and all that.
[02:39:41.292 --> 02:39:43.633]  I mean, it's just neocon stuff.
[02:39:43.633 --> 02:39:45.255]  But, thank you.
[02:39:45.255 --> 02:39:46.776]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:46.776 --> 02:39:50.118]  Let's talk to... He certainly is entertaining.
[02:39:50.118 --> 02:39:53.021]  Jack Van Impey and Rex Sillivan Impey.
[02:39:53.021 --> 02:39:53.921]  Revelation.
[02:39:53.921 --> 02:39:57.044]  Tonight, George Bush fights the devil.
[02:39:57.044 --> 02:39:58.405]  When he's at Bohemian Grove.
[02:39:58.405 --> 02:40:02.648]  Why doesn't Jack Van Impey do a show about skull and bones and the Satan worship of government leaders?
[02:40:02.648 --> 02:40:03.168]  No.
[02:40:03.168 --> 02:40:05.170]  No, they're not going to do that.
[02:40:05.170 --> 02:40:06.391]  Dan in New Mexico.
[02:40:06.391 --> 02:40:07.312]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:40:07.312 --> 02:40:07.672]  Go ahead.
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:11.242]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:11.242 --> 02:40:23.532]  I'm with the Alamogordo Second Amendment Task Force, and we branched off from the Anchorage Second Amendment Task Force, and I wanted to let you know that they are effecting some change up there in Anchorage.
[02:40:23.532 --> 02:40:32.239]  They actually got Palmer, which is right next to Wasco, where your friend Sarah Paley came from, they got him to drop some
[02:40:33.675 --> 02:40:40.024]  Gun laws that were restricting the free carry of people in the city.
[02:40:40.024 --> 02:40:43.549]  Because people spoke up and brought it to their attention and they got them to drop it.
[02:40:46.067 --> 02:40:53.349]  Yes, when we fight back against the gun control, the victim disarmament, we gain ground.
[02:40:53.349 --> 02:41:01.431]  That's why we have to get angry and be focused and know the globalist strategy is to restrict our guns at the county, city, and state level.
[02:41:01.431 --> 02:41:09.394]  And through color of law fraud, the feds have all the major gun shops and gun shows registering people to buy ammo.
[02:41:10.270 --> 02:41:16.054]  When there's only laws on that in Chicago, New York City, and in California now.
[02:41:16.054 --> 02:41:23.720]  So we've got to fight, because this victim disarmament, this slave disarmament, is really expanding right now.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:31.646]  I sent the link to Aaron, so maybe you got to put it up and show people that when you speak up and what you're talking about, you can't affect change.
[02:41:31.646 --> 02:41:32.407]  Good job, Dan.
[02:41:32.407 --> 02:41:33.588]  Appreciate the call.
[02:41:33.588 --> 02:41:34.468]  Jim in Texas.
[02:41:34.468 --> 02:41:35.389]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:37.631]  Welcome.
[02:41:37.631 --> 02:41:38.992]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call, man.
[02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:41.331]  Welcome, Jim.
[02:41:41.331 --> 02:41:45.733]  Hey, I'm a non-commissioned officer up here at Fort Hood, and there's a couple things.
[02:41:45.733 --> 02:41:51.496]  You might have actually already talked about this before, but there's a base sticker you have to get.
[02:41:51.496 --> 02:41:54.258]  It's required to get on post.
[02:41:54.258 --> 02:41:58.540]  And with that, you get an RFID tracking chip in your window.
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:42:04.523]  And recently, I guess it's recently, they just started doing facial scans.
[02:42:04.523 --> 02:42:07.405]  And let me also state that none of my opinions stated here
[02:42:07.955 --> 02:42:09.416]  Reflect that in the Department of Defense.
[02:42:09.416 --> 02:42:12.958]  I don't want to get into any trouble here.
[02:42:12.958 --> 02:42:22.344]  Well, remember that when we got the Homeland Security documents and broke them in the MIAC reports, it states, Al Qaeda is not what Homeland Security is for.
[02:42:22.344 --> 02:42:29.149]  The number one enemy of NORTHCOM and Homeland Security, because they're controlled by offshore banks, they're criminal,
[02:42:29.909 --> 02:42:30.530]  We're good to go.
[02:42:46.528 --> 02:43:04.001]  And so, the entire Homeland Security System, just like it came out in the newspapers months after we first broke it, the Army, internally, sent us that document, others published it, the Baltimore Sun reported on it, that the, in the Fed rallies, have Army intelligence watching them.
[02:43:04.001 --> 02:43:08.505]  Ron Paul, myself, and it says, as potential terrorists.
[02:43:08.505 --> 02:43:10.906]  No, the people following
[02:43:12.317 --> 02:43:21.239]  And I wanted to share with you something else.
[02:43:21.239 --> 02:43:25.440]  It's the Department of Defense Directive 1344.10.
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:37.682]  And that's what protects soldiers and their ability to go write letters to newspapers, to express their opinions, and to be heard on shows like yours.
[02:43:37.682 --> 02:43:39.903]  I heard an active duty soldier call in.
[02:43:40.450 --> 02:43:42.992]  And say that he could get in trouble for what he was doing.
[02:43:42.992 --> 02:43:44.534]  But that's actually false.
[02:43:44.534 --> 02:43:49.879]  As long as you kind of follow the guidelines set up for you and that, you can do just as I'm doing right now.
[02:43:49.879 --> 02:43:50.239]  That's right.
[02:43:50.239 --> 02:44:04.933]  When you're off duty, as long as you don't talk bad about the Commander-in-Chief, or your superiors, or directly against policies, as a soldier, you can talk, when you're wearing the hat of a civilian, all you want.
[02:44:06.099 --> 02:44:09.702]  And look, sir, they're just letting you know you're being face scanned.
[02:44:09.702 --> 02:44:11.304]  You were always being face scanned.
[02:44:11.304 --> 02:44:13.345]  Face scanning cameras have been in for 20 years.
[02:44:13.345 --> 02:44:15.127]  DARPA put them in.
[02:44:15.127 --> 02:44:18.350]  License plate readers have been in for at least 20 years.
[02:44:18.350 --> 02:44:27.297]  Now, off the license plate reader, then the ground-based camera can identify off your license plate that that's Joe Smith getting out of his car.
[02:44:28.118 --> 02:44:31.562]  Then they get a heat resonance scan off your face.
[02:44:31.562 --> 02:44:33.184]  That's now uploaded.
[02:44:33.184 --> 02:44:40.653]  They get a overview shot to your heat resonance and then with satellites they can track your heat resonance.
[02:44:41.713 --> 02:44:43.714]  I mean, sir, it's so Buck Rogers.
[02:44:43.714 --> 02:44:47.995]  That's why the head of Google is out there saying, yeah, we watch everything you do.
[02:44:47.995 --> 02:44:52.536]  You know, that's why Yahoo is openly announcing that they just give everything to the feds.
[02:44:52.536 --> 02:44:53.977]  No warrants.
[02:44:53.977 --> 02:44:55.697]  Local police can get everything they want.
[02:44:55.697 --> 02:44:56.678]  No warrants.
[02:44:56.678 --> 02:44:58.958]  It's just a lawless criminal government.
[02:44:58.958 --> 02:45:03.420]  Bloomberg's reporting that Goldman Sachs is arming itself with weapons against the public.
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:13.288]  They know they've robbed us blind, they know they're illegitimate, just like Stalin and Hitler and Mao armed against the people, and they want our guns!
[02:45:13.288 --> 02:45:25.757]  And, um... I mean, did the military at Fort Hood wake up when the MIAC and Homeland Security report came out saying the number one threat to America is veterans?
[02:45:25.757 --> 02:45:31.282]  I've always been a pretty big advocate of the Constitution, and I pass out pocket constitutions to my soldiers
[02:45:31.863 --> 02:45:39.546]  And I regularly quiz them on what we're held by, you know, by law and by our God to hold up.
[02:45:39.546 --> 02:45:43.328]  And that is the Constitution of the United States of America, and that is to protect the people.
[02:45:43.328 --> 02:45:55.314]  So there are lawful orders that we are uphold to protect and support, but at the same time, we have a right to defend that document over unlawful orders.
[02:45:55.314 --> 02:45:56.414]  Amen to that, my friend.
[02:45:56.414 --> 02:45:58.555]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[02:45:58.555 --> 02:46:00.616]  How many soldiers are waking up out there on the base?
[02:46:04.333 --> 02:46:05.454]  How many soldiers?
[02:46:05.454 --> 02:46:18.282]  I'm in a smaller unit, so I couldn't really be specific on that, but you see a lot less of the George Bush stickers, obviously, in the office.
[02:46:18.282 --> 02:46:28.108]  And on all that, you don't see the neoconservative banner like you did before, and obviously with the new administration.
[02:46:28.108 --> 02:46:29.028]  You see a lot.
[02:46:29.028 --> 02:46:32.951]  I'm trying to not be specific on certain things, not to put myself in any sort of trouble,
[02:46:33.635 --> 02:46:38.218]  You see a lot of change, and everybody's waking up out here, Alex.
[02:46:38.218 --> 02:46:41.960]  So, the troops are aware of the New World Order?
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:42.641]  Absolutely.
[02:46:42.641 --> 02:46:56.930]  Well, we've been... There's a lot of stuff that I'd love to say, but I don't want to paint myself into... Are the troops suspicious of the shooting out there?
[02:46:56.930 --> 02:47:00.252]  Well, Alex, let me just comment on that real briefly.
[02:47:01.031 --> 02:47:05.593]  And I had a good friend of mine, a non-commissioned officer, fellow non-commissioned officer.
[02:47:05.593 --> 02:47:15.058]  He was there and he was actually helping with the wounded soldiers and getting them to the ambulances and holding the IVs and whatnot.
[02:47:15.058 --> 02:47:18.380]  And he said to me that he saw the shooter on the ground.
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:23.983]  Now this could be just attributed to all the adrenaline rush, but you know, most of us have felt it before in warfare.
[02:47:23.983 --> 02:47:29.866]  But he said he saw the shooter on the ground, disarmed, shot several times, and he still heard gunfire.
[02:47:30.464 --> 02:47:39.128]  So, now whether that's true or not, I'm not... Well, no, that's what all the reports are from Hood, and it turns out they knew everything he was doing.
[02:47:39.128 --> 02:47:40.648]  He thought he was emailing Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:40.648 --> 02:47:42.169]  He was, Al-Cieda.
[02:47:42.169 --> 02:47:45.030]  He was emailing the CIA, posing as Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:46.071]  He was being protected.
[02:47:46.071 --> 02:47:46.691]  They used that...
[02:47:47.171 --> 02:47:52.914]  Imam, who's the honeypot for all these synthetic Al-Qaeda they've got.
[02:47:52.914 --> 02:48:02.959]  They do find mentally ill people like him, and they protected him, and Congress has asked Homeland Security and the Pentagon for that data, and they've declared national security on it.
[02:48:02.959 --> 02:48:11.603]  So bare minimum, it's like the first World Trade Center bombing, where their own informant said, they told me, cook the bomb, train the drivers.
[02:48:11.603 --> 02:48:15.225]  Then we were supposed to bust them, but they said, no, let the bombing go forward.
[02:48:16.045 --> 02:48:20.546]  And so bare minimum, this was a provocateur action.
[02:48:20.546 --> 02:48:26.787]  I mean, no one else would be allowed to be running around the base and when he was in medical school saying, I love suicide bombers.
[02:48:26.787 --> 02:48:29.308]  Anybody else said that, they'd have been out in 10 seconds.
[02:48:29.308 --> 02:48:33.909]  He was protected the entire time and allowed to do this.
[02:48:33.909 --> 02:48:38.290]  And it's disgusting.
[02:48:38.290 --> 02:48:43.811]  On that, but my heart goes out to all those that were shot and all the families that were affected.
[02:48:44.994 --> 02:48:59.307]  But it does seem a little odd to us, to some of us, but, you know, once again, there's not a whole lot to... Yeah, well, most of my family are former military, and they all just said, and a lot of them don't even agree with me politically, they go, that's, something's going on, that's a bunch of bull.
[02:48:59.307 --> 02:49:04.272]  I mean, anybody who knows, has got their head screwed on, knows a staged event when you see it.
[02:49:04.272 --> 02:49:06.574]  God bless you, and I appreciate your call, Jim.
[02:49:06.574 --> 02:49:09.257]  We don't know exactly what happened, but it stinks to high heaven, doesn't it?
[02:49:10.774 --> 02:49:11.954]  Stinks to high heaven.
[02:49:11.954 --> 02:49:13.875]  Let's play Von Rumpy.
[02:49:13.875 --> 02:49:14.896]  Now, there's so many.
[02:49:14.896 --> 02:49:25.299]  I could play the UN head, Ban Ki-moon, I can play Al Gore, saying Copenhagen is the heart of world government, for global governance, and this is the year of world government.
[02:49:25.299 --> 02:49:32.762]  Now, if you talk about this, though, Homeland Security, the ADL, and everybody else are going to say you're wearing Nazi underwear.
[02:49:32.762 --> 02:49:34.523]  What does this have to do with Nazis?
[02:49:34.523 --> 02:49:36.804]  Only that Hitler wanted a European Union.
[02:49:36.804 --> 02:49:39.825]  So I guess those that want a global union are actually for Hitler.
[02:49:40.762 --> 02:49:44.083]  But, doesn't matter, you're wearing swastika underwear if you play this clip.
[02:49:44.083 --> 02:49:47.925]  Here's the head of the EU two weeks ago.
[02:49:47.925 --> 02:49:55.628]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[02:49:55.628 --> 02:50:04.352]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[02:50:04.352 --> 02:50:09.714]  Our mission, our presidency, is one of hope, supported by acts
[02:50:11.317 --> 02:50:14.941]  I bring you good news from the United States.
[02:50:34.051 --> 02:50:42.435]  Within one month of taking office, President Obama secured $80 billion U.S.
[02:50:42.435 --> 02:50:48.038]  for renewable energy and green infrastructure.
[02:50:48.038 --> 02:50:56.363]  And then just two weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed the Waxman-Markey bill, which
[02:50:57.549 --> 02:51:00.773]  We're going to come back with this global governance comment.
[02:51:13.234 --> 02:51:15.836]  What do you have to say about the wild food experience?
[02:51:15.836 --> 02:51:21.020]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:22.261]  Boy, was I wrong.
[02:51:22.261 --> 02:51:25.424]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[02:51:25.424 --> 02:51:29.287]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[02:51:29.287 --> 02:51:32.510]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[02:51:32.510 --> 02:51:33.050]  Wow!
[02:51:33.050 --> 02:51:34.572]  I watched the DVD last night.
[02:51:34.572 --> 02:51:35.793]  I was awestruck.
[02:51:35.793 --> 02:51:37.474]  What wonderful work you have done.
[02:51:37.474 --> 02:51:40.016]  This information can bless many people.
[02:51:40.016 --> 02:51:41.017]  Thank you again.
[02:51:41.237 --> 02:51:41.957]  Thanks again!
[02:51:41.957 --> 02:51:45.079]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[02:51:45.079 --> 02:51:45.680]  Thank you.
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:49.102]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:51:49.102 --> 02:51:52.684]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.

[02:52:01.870 --> 02:52:05.873]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:05.873 --> 02:52:09.115]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.115 --> 02:52:10.536]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.238 --> 02:52:13.921]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:13.921 --> 02:52:20.306]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.306 --> 02:52:25.491]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.491 --> 02:52:35.480]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:37.942]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:37.942 --> 02:52:39.523]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.523 --> 02:52:41.985]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.985 --> 02:52:43.846]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:43.846 --> 02:52:49.270]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.270 --> 02:52:58.376]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:00.635 --> 02:53:04.016]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:53:04.016 --> 02:53:07.918]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:53:07.918 --> 02:53:11.639]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:11.639 --> 02:53:18.942]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[02:53:20.350 --> 02:53:20.830]  I think so.

[02:54:11.127 --> 02:54:17.238]  Coming up at the 8 after, we have the webmaster from Cryptome.org.
[02:54:17.238 --> 02:54:21.005]  Yahoo is threatening to sue them right now.
[02:54:21.005 --> 02:54:23.870]  Here's the Infowars.com headline from Kurt Nemo.
[02:54:25.034 --> 02:54:29.136]  Yahoo threatens Cryptome over leaked surveillance document.
[02:54:29.136 --> 02:54:29.976]  No warrants.
[02:54:29.976 --> 02:54:31.116]  No nothing.
[02:54:31.116 --> 02:54:32.757]  The police want your data.
[02:54:32.757 --> 02:54:33.838]  They want your emails.
[02:54:33.838 --> 02:54:35.138]  They want your instant messages.
[02:54:35.138 --> 02:54:36.279]  It's just given.
[02:54:36.279 --> 02:54:37.859]  For a small fee.
[02:54:37.859 --> 02:54:41.141]  And then I thought I would just pull one article up from a few years ago.
[02:54:41.141 --> 02:54:45.042]  Missouri tracks scofflaws via pizza delivery databases.
[02:54:45.042 --> 02:54:48.804]  In fact, give me a document cam shot of this.
[02:54:48.804 --> 02:54:51.445]  And it says that, and this is from many years ago,
[02:54:52.876 --> 02:54:55.517]  USA Today actually running an AP article.
[02:54:55.517 --> 02:55:02.701]  And it says, yeah, all the big pizza chains, when you call to get a pizza, they run a background check on you to let the police know where you're at.
[02:55:02.701 --> 02:55:04.622]  See, everything is a control grid.
[02:55:04.622 --> 02:55:10.064]  Face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, heat resonance.
[02:55:10.064 --> 02:55:17.748]  Remember, I'd tell you 14 years ago how all babies in Commonwealth countries, including the US, were really basically a Commonwealth nation under the same agreements.
[02:55:18.408 --> 02:55:20.670]  Had your blood taken for a DNA database.
[02:55:20.670 --> 02:55:24.592]  Declassified earlier this year, exactly as I told you.
[02:55:24.592 --> 02:55:34.219]  Because I was reading University of Texas documents, how they were one of the four suppositories in the country.
[02:55:34.219 --> 02:55:34.919]  Suppository.
[02:55:34.919 --> 02:55:35.600]  Depository.
[02:55:36.994 --> 02:55:37.274]  I think?
[02:55:58.490 --> 02:56:04.954]  Remember in my film Endgame three years ago, I exposed Dr. Watson as a top eugenicist who doesn't believe blacks are humans.
[02:56:04.954 --> 02:56:09.357]  He's the discoverer of the double helix of DNA.
[02:56:09.357 --> 02:56:15.401]  These are the crypto-Nazis, the underground... because Hitler got all his ideas from the US and England.
[02:56:15.401 --> 02:56:19.464]  He thanked US eugenicists and British eugenicists in Mein Kampf for my struggle.
[02:56:20.612 --> 02:56:25.697]  And so the Human Genome Project's main goal is race-specific bioweapons.
[02:56:25.697 --> 02:56:40.513]  The problem is we're all so closely interrelated that say if Israel, which looked into this with South Africa, wants to create a race-specific soft kill weapon or hard kill weapon for the Arabs, they can't because so many Jewish people actually are
[02:56:42.136 --> 02:56:42.456]  So far.
[02:56:59.489 --> 02:57:00.990]  in black people.
[02:57:00.990 --> 02:57:04.412]  And northern Europeans do not even have the couplers.
[02:57:04.412 --> 02:57:16.040]  It's very hard for a northern European, and the studies are there, that whites who even have similar high-risk sex partners, especially northern Europeans, it's very hard to get HIV.
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:18.962]  But blacks pretty much instantly get it.
[02:57:18.962 --> 02:57:20.503]  But I'm now digressing.
[02:57:20.503 --> 02:57:27.548]  The point is they're taking your blood, and if they want to create a race-specific bioweapon just for you, the state-of-the-art science is there.
[02:57:27.548 --> 02:57:28.849]  They just go remove the sample,
[02:57:29.369 --> 02:57:33.750]  They can make the bioweapon just for you and then kill you better than a hammer.
[02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:37.572]  So that's how this loving system works.
[02:57:37.572 --> 02:57:41.533]  And so I thought we would go over some of that, but I already digress.
[02:57:41.533 --> 02:57:44.934]  I was just getting into the overall surveillance grid.
[02:57:45.851 --> 02:57:46.271]  Success.
[02:58:14.656 --> 02:58:20.281]  But it is the awareness itself that will drive the change.
[02:58:20.281 --> 02:58:26.666]  And one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements.
[02:58:26.666 --> 02:58:35.753]  But the many business leaders who have been present here are among those taking leadership in other ways.
[02:58:35.753 --> 02:58:42.338]  We talked, for example, about... We'll be right back with the final hour.
[02:58:42.338 --> 02:58:44.120]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.876 --> 02:58:50.501]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.501 --> 02:58:55.045]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.045 --> 02:58:59.389]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.389 --> 02:59:05.155]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.155 --> 02:59:10.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:11.561]  Number 3.
[02:59:11.561 --> 02:59:15.164]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.164 --> 02:59:19.068]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.068 --> 02:59:19.868]  Number 4.
[02:59:19.868 --> 02:59:22.631]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.631 --> 02:59:26.314]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.314 --> 02:59:27.115]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.115 --> 02:59:31.259]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.259 --> 02:59:36.023]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.303 --> 02:59:40.465]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:59:42.246 --> 02:59:44.507]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:59:47.108 --> 02:59:48.489]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:48.489 --> 02:59:54.492]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:08.604 --> 03:00:10.545]  Okay, here's what's going to happen.
[03:00:10.545 --> 03:00:20.893]  For two segments, I've got the webmaster of Cryptome.org really doing a great job reporting on just the open surveillance.
[03:00:20.893 --> 03:00:23.174]  No Bill of Rights, no Constitution.
[03:00:23.174 --> 03:00:25.976]  Just need to let you know what's going on there.
[03:00:25.976 --> 03:00:33.922]  Then the last 30 minutes, I'm going to get into the latest on Copenhagen and the EPA in line with that saying they're going to list carbon dioxide that
[03:00:34.742 --> 03:00:41.890]  Humans exhale that plants live off of, that they respirate with, then they put off oxygen, that's the cycle of life.
[03:00:41.890 --> 03:00:53.864]  Taxing that, and Maury Strong is on record at the UN saying, we're going to destroy industrial society, make people so poor they can't have children, then the state is going to take everyone's children at birth and raise them in government dormitories.
[03:00:54.525 --> 03:01:00.850]  That's also in the White House Science Czar's book, how they're going to put chemicals in the water to sterilize you and the family.
[03:01:00.850 --> 03:01:09.417]  Just so happens the 150 plus on average, some it's over 300, chemicals added to your water supply under the product name sodium fluoride.
[03:01:09.417 --> 03:01:11.078]  It's not just sodium fluoride.
[03:01:11.078 --> 03:01:19.165]  Just so happens to sterilize all known mammal species, massively reduce fertility, and cause bone cancer, brain cancer, and attack the thyroid.
[03:01:20.987 --> 03:01:23.068]  So enjoy yourselves out there while you're drinking that.
[03:01:23.068 --> 03:01:29.112]  And of course, if you don't believe me, just Google eco-science calls for global government adding chemicals to water to sterilize.
[03:01:29.112 --> 03:01:31.714]  You'll get AP and Reuters on that.
[03:01:31.714 --> 03:01:33.295]  This is your loving government.
[03:01:33.295 --> 03:01:34.876]  This is who runs things.
[03:01:34.876 --> 03:01:39.759]  This is the people who openly say they're already killing you.
[03:01:39.759 --> 03:01:47.223]  We're just supposed to sit here and take it and go watch the football game and go, oh, I love it that you take all the baby's blood at birth for your bio-weapons program.
[03:01:47.223 --> 03:01:48.264]  Oh, it's so nice of you.
[03:01:49.653 --> 03:01:52.875]  Let's play this clip of Schmidt, then I'll jam in a few calls if we have time.
[03:01:52.875 --> 03:01:57.578]  Here's the head of Google who, it turned out, his houses you can't see with Street View.
[03:01:57.578 --> 03:01:59.900]  His houses you can't see with satellite photos.
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:02.082]  His information's all protected.
[03:02:02.082 --> 03:02:12.068]  And he admitted three years ago, through a patent that Google got, that they're using the audio sensor, the microphone, and the video camera to listen to you in real time.
[03:02:12.068 --> 03:02:13.690]  But he said, don't worry, humans aren't.
[03:02:13.690 --> 03:02:15.211]  Computers are creating text.
[03:02:15.751 --> 03:02:22.817]  Like NSA text, Echelon text, that then do an algorithm, if they hear a dog barking, dog food ads pop up.
[03:02:22.817 --> 03:02:24.598]  Oh, you didn't know that's why that's happening?
[03:02:24.598 --> 03:02:26.459]  It's not just cookies of where you go.
[03:02:26.459 --> 03:02:32.364]  It's already in place, just they're listening to you, openly bragging, and this is what he has to say about it on CNBC.
[03:02:32.364 --> 03:02:36.767]  People are treating Google like their most trusted friend.
[03:02:36.767 --> 03:02:38.549]  Should they be?
[03:02:38.549 --> 03:02:41.351]  Well, I think judgment matters.
[03:02:41.351 --> 03:02:43.653]  Eric Schmidt is Google's CEO.
[03:02:44.244 --> 03:02:49.647]  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[03:02:49.647 --> 03:02:58.413]  But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time.
[03:02:58.413 --> 03:03:03.115]  And it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act.
[03:03:03.115 --> 03:03:07.938]  It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities.
[03:03:07.938 --> 03:03:10.380]  What a great setup for our next guest coming up!
[03:03:11.621 --> 03:03:28.552]  See, oh, from, do no evil, don't be evil, to, oh, we don't surveil any of you, don't worry, it's no big deal, just to, look, we got satellite scans of all your heat residents, we're totally controlling you, we're already spiking your water supply, ha ha ha, there's nothing you can do.
[03:03:28.552 --> 03:03:29.793]  I mean, it's just, hey!
[03:03:31.038 --> 03:03:33.400]  You know, you don't deserve to live in privacy.
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:34.341]  You don't deserve.
[03:03:34.341 --> 03:03:36.263]  There's no Fourth Amendment.
[03:03:36.263 --> 03:03:38.085]  You are going to be surveilled.
[03:03:38.085 --> 03:03:39.426]  That's the way it is.
[03:03:39.426 --> 03:03:41.929]  And we're going to use microphones to listen to you in your house.
[03:03:41.929 --> 03:03:42.950]  By the way, you don't believe me?
[03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:44.351]  Just use Google.
[03:03:44.351 --> 03:03:44.891]  Google.
[03:03:44.891 --> 03:03:48.515]  Google to use cameras and computers to surveil you.
[03:03:48.515 --> 03:03:50.337]  We wrote articles about that three years ago.
[03:03:50.337 --> 03:03:53.280]  With links to press releases by Google.
[03:03:54.417 --> 03:03:58.200]  And then Yahoo came out and said, oh, our system's better.
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:03:59.661]  We're surveilling you better.
[03:03:59.661 --> 03:04:06.005]  And then, again, this is the in-your-face system.
[03:04:06.005 --> 03:04:07.586]  It's way past 1984.
[03:04:07.586 --> 03:04:10.849]  It's way past, and here's another tidbit.
[03:04:10.849 --> 03:04:15.372]  Notice the movies, every movie I see now has people being tasered, and it's funny.
[03:04:15.372 --> 03:04:19.555]  Torture is funny, and paying compliance is taught to all our police now.
[03:04:19.555 --> 03:04:20.816]  You can't torture Al-Syedah.
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:25.763]  You know, they sell us on that idea, but they are torturing these people for fake confessions.
[03:04:25.763 --> 03:04:27.243]  But then, oh, paying compliance?
[03:04:27.243 --> 03:04:37.610]  You can take a pro-lifer sitting on a sidewalk and break their arm with their bones sticking out, like I show in my film, Martial Law, and the police go to federal court and they say, yeah, paying compliance.
[03:04:37.610 --> 03:04:39.872]  They taser people to give urine samples now.
[03:04:40.652 --> 03:04:43.814]  You see all the videos of a young lady that didn't answer the questions of the police?
[03:04:43.814 --> 03:04:45.555]  They just knock her teeth out!
[03:04:45.555 --> 03:04:45.775]  Ah!
[03:04:45.775 --> 03:04:47.816]  She's beating them in the head with clubs!
[03:04:47.816 --> 03:04:49.376]  That's how this world operates.
[03:04:49.376 --> 03:04:50.837]  They're letting you know.
[03:04:50.837 --> 03:04:55.880]  You're here to supply the establishment and then we're going to euthanize you as soon as you get old.
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:04:59.322]  Just like the cover of Newsweek said, the case for killing Granny.
[03:04:59.322 --> 03:04:59.862]  They love it!
[03:05:01.578 --> 03:05:07.160]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[03:06:01.832 --> 03:06:05.853]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:05.853 --> 03:06:09.094]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.094 --> 03:06:13.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:06:13.895 --> 03:06:20.297]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:20.297 --> 03:06:22.538]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.058 --> 03:06:24.218]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:06:24.218 --> 03:06:24.999]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:24.999 --> 03:06:27.339]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:41.963 --> 03:06:49.246]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:49.246 --> 03:06:58.350]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:07:01.069 --> 03:07:04.072]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:04.072 --> 03:07:09.397]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:09.397 --> 03:07:11.459]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:11.459 --> 03:07:16.464]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.464 --> 03:07:17.365]  How much do you want?
[03:07:17.625 --> 03:07:18.746]  When do you want it?
[03:07:18.746 --> 03:07:20.627]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:20.627 --> 03:07:21.708]  When will you need it?
[03:07:21.708 --> 03:07:23.909]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:23.909 --> 03:07:25.250]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.250 --> 03:07:26.771]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:26.771 --> 03:07:32.055]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.055 --> 03:07:35.637]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:35.637 --> 03:07:39.100]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.440 --> 03:07:40.681]  How much will you need?
[03:07:40.681 --> 03:07:41.582]  We don't know.
[03:07:41.582 --> 03:07:42.682]  How much do you want?
[03:07:42.682 --> 03:07:43.603]  All you can get.
[03:07:43.603 --> 03:07:44.704]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:44.704 --> 03:07:47.766]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:47.766 --> 03:07:48.287]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:48.287 --> 03:07:49.948]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:49.948 --> 03:07:51.029]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:51.029 --> 03:07:53.991]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.148 --> 03:08:13.891]  Okay, I'm going to do a full breakdown on the Copenhagen World Government Summit.
[03:08:13.891 --> 03:08:23.257]  If our nation signs on to it, if the Senate ratifies it, 191 signatories will have to unanimously vote for any nation to be able to leave.
[03:08:23.257 --> 03:08:28.520]  Total global governance over all carbon dioxide, all other greenhouse gases.
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:30.921]  In the words of the UN, Maury Strong.
[03:08:30.921 --> 03:08:32.162]  Let's pull up the exact quote.
[03:08:32.162 --> 03:08:32.802]  Ask Aaron for it.
[03:08:32.802 --> 03:08:33.563]  I don't have it in front of me.
[03:08:33.563 --> 03:08:34.623]  There's many quotes.
[03:08:34.623 --> 03:08:36.825]  To destroy all industrial society,
[03:08:37.225 --> 03:08:41.970]  So that eugenics can be carried out against the population.
[03:08:41.970 --> 03:08:57.605]  So that is coming up, but for the next 30 minutes, we are joined by John Young of Cryptome.org, one of the best, it was kind of Wikileaks before Wikileaks, on issues of government spying, surveillance, illegal surveillance, you name it.
[03:08:58.366 --> 03:09:01.709]  And they're really a clearinghouse posting and publishing a lot of this.
[03:09:01.709 --> 03:09:04.451]  He pointed out to me in an email that he didn't even break this.
[03:09:04.451 --> 03:09:06.212]  They just hosted the documents.
[03:09:06.212 --> 03:09:09.955]  Yahoo threatens Cryptome over leaked surveillance document.
[03:09:09.955 --> 03:09:23.886]  Yahoo, the internet corporation notorious for helping China implement totalitarian censorship of the web, has instructed its lawyers to go after Cryptome, a site that functions as a repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying and surveillance.
[03:09:24.466 --> 03:09:32.648]  Michael T. Gershberg of the law firm, and it goes on, sent a DMC takedown order notice to John Young, Cryptome webmaster.
[03:09:32.648 --> 03:09:42.311]  On December 3rd, the law firm claims that Cryptome has violated Yahoo's intellectual property rights and copyright by posting Yahoo's compliance guide for law enforcement.
[03:09:42.311 --> 03:09:44.632]  Young has refused to remove the document from his website.
[03:09:44.632 --> 03:09:47.133]  The takedown order is posted on the Cryptome website.
[03:09:48.013 --> 03:09:54.706]  And we've got his comments here pointing out they never registered it as copyrighted, and he's being pretty sarcastic with them.
[03:09:54.706 --> 03:09:57.572]  But it's good to have him here with us today.
[03:09:57.572 --> 03:09:58.854]  Mr. Young, thank you for joining us.
[03:10:00.711 --> 03:10:02.753]  Tell us just briefly about Cryptome.org.
[03:10:02.753 --> 03:10:04.955]  I mean, a lot of my listeners are big supporters of it.
[03:10:04.955 --> 03:10:07.357]  I've been learning a lot for many years from it.
[03:10:07.357 --> 03:10:10.800]  But for those that don't know, a snapshot of Cryptome.org.
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:17.426]  And this is only the latest persecution and visitation that you guys have had over the years.
[03:10:17.426 --> 03:10:24.612]  So perhaps give us a little bit of background on that and then this latest trip into Orwellville.
[03:10:24.612 --> 03:10:25.052]  Great.
[03:10:25.052 --> 03:10:26.794]  Good opportunity to speak with you, Alex.
[03:10:27.935 --> 03:10:34.538]  We set this site up 13 years ago to publish information that the government didn't want the public to see.
[03:10:34.538 --> 03:10:36.118]  It's its only purpose.
[03:10:36.118 --> 03:10:48.103]  We've since expanded into commercial stuff that businesses don't want the public to see, but most of it had to do with publishing government documents that they had rather the public not see.
[03:10:48.103 --> 03:10:56.367]  So people send us documents that they have access to, or we get them through FOIA, or they show up from unknown sources.
[03:10:56.367 --> 03:10:57.147]  So we publish it.
[03:10:58.164 --> 03:11:03.848]  Uh, without editorial remarks in most cases and let the readers decide what they think about it.
[03:11:03.848 --> 03:11:06.370]  So it's more like a library than a blog.
[03:11:06.370 --> 03:11:14.296]  And so we have about 45,000 documents now on the website that have been collected and put up for public reading.
[03:11:14.296 --> 03:11:26.524]  The most recent series we've been putting up are telecom law enforcement compliance guides in which they are obliged to provide access to telecom records through the
[03:11:28.447 --> 03:11:32.351]  through official legislation established for this purpose.
[03:11:32.351 --> 03:11:39.358]  Most of these guys are kept private because the telecoms don't want the public to know that they're selling this information to the government.
[03:11:39.358 --> 03:11:43.742]  Christopher Salogian broke this story a week ago on his website.
[03:11:43.742 --> 03:11:51.349]  He's a student at Indiana University and he'd been doing research on this and asking for FOIA information and he was refused.
[03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:52.951]  But he did get copies of letters from
[03:11:54.079 --> 03:12:02.944]  Verizon and Sprint objecting to the release of what they call confidential business information because if the public saw it they would be very upset with us.
[03:12:02.944 --> 03:12:10.389]  Well, lo and behold, a day or two later someone sent us a copy of Yahoo's lawful compliance guide, so we put it up.
[03:12:10.965 --> 03:12:15.187]  And now they have thankfully verified it's authentic by saying, yes, that's ours.
[03:12:15.187 --> 03:12:23.432]  Just like the ClimateGate swindlers, the top UN scientists all colluding in fraud to hide the decline in global temperatures in the last nine years.
[03:12:23.432 --> 03:12:25.133]  They came out and admitted, yeah, those are ours.
[03:12:25.133 --> 03:12:26.133]  Somebody stole them.
[03:12:26.133 --> 03:12:27.694]  So it's always a nice verification.
[03:12:27.694 --> 03:12:29.995]  That's right.
[03:12:29.995 --> 03:12:38.600]  And so, along with the Yahoos, we've got about eight or nine others from telecom companies that have similar policies in place, which they've never disclosed before.
[03:12:40.219 --> 03:12:40.579]  I think so.
[03:12:59.445 --> 03:13:00.706]  There's a lot of fake ones too.
[03:13:00.706 --> 03:13:03.767]  We've noticed most of the ones we've gone through have been fake.
[03:13:03.767 --> 03:13:08.669]  We always challenge it with the federal filing and federal court and have beaten them.
[03:13:08.669 --> 03:13:11.530]  But that's if they try to carry the takedown order through.
[03:13:11.530 --> 03:13:12.831]  Of course, that's hard to do with all of our
[03:13:14.965 --> 03:13:15.345]  We're good to go.
[03:13:44.633 --> 03:13:46.434]  Well, nearly all these are the same.
[03:13:46.434 --> 03:14:03.002]  They have set up policy to comply with the so-called CALEA requirement, which is Communication Assistance for Law Enforcement, which the law passed back in the late 90s to force telecom companies to comply with requests from law enforcement agencies.
[03:14:03.002 --> 03:14:07.644]  So they set up policies to comply with this, but also set up fees for providing the service.
[03:14:08.610 --> 03:14:11.452]  It turns out there's nothing controversial about the compliance part.
[03:14:11.452 --> 03:14:17.776]  It's the fees that they want to keep quiet, which has never been publicized, because they think that's confidential business information.
[03:14:17.776 --> 03:14:22.218]  So that's what they're fighting about, is the money they're making off this.
[03:14:22.218 --> 03:14:26.821]  Well, I've had the Feds show up here a couple times, and they just say, just give us people's names.
[03:14:26.821 --> 03:14:28.502]  And I go, no.
[03:14:28.502 --> 03:14:30.003]  Go get a subpoena.
[03:14:30.003 --> 03:14:33.345]  And they have subpoenaed us twice.
[03:14:33.345 --> 03:14:36.247]  And the Feds are like, well, usually people don't make us have a warrant.
[03:14:38.069 --> 03:14:45.611]  Well, one of the things that Chris Slogan found out was that there's an in-run that can be made with Internet information.
[03:14:45.611 --> 03:14:48.772]  Most of the time restrictions are on wiretap of telephones.
[03:14:48.772 --> 03:14:50.873]  That's the legacy of legislation.
[03:14:50.873 --> 03:14:56.234]  But for Internet, they can go around by providing information through loopholes in the law.
[03:14:56.234 --> 03:14:57.214]  And that's what they've been doing.
[03:14:57.214 --> 03:15:01.175]  And that's what people didn't know about it, which Chris revealed.
[03:15:01.175 --> 03:15:02.636]  And that's what these documents show.
[03:15:02.636 --> 03:15:06.737]  They put up a brave front of showing they're complying, but they're in fact providing information
[03:15:07.389 --> 03:15:11.271]  That is not covered in the legislation.
[03:15:11.271 --> 03:15:17.173]  And that's their emails, that's the instant messages, it's all itemized.
[03:15:17.173 --> 03:15:19.434]  You know, you want it, Yahoo's got it.
[03:15:19.434 --> 03:15:20.934]  That's right.
[03:15:20.934 --> 03:15:24.096]  And it turns out it's a very lucrative business.
[03:15:24.096 --> 03:15:27.617]  That's what was surprising Chris found out, was that how much money they're making off this.
[03:15:28.795 --> 03:15:42.524]  I saw a story last week where Sprint got 8 million law enforcement requests last year alone for GPS location off the cell phones, which is part of the Telecom Act of 1996.
[03:15:42.524 --> 03:15:50.710]  By law, October 1st, 2001, all cell phones have to be tracked in real time off the GPS triangulation from the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:53.732]  It's really 3 feet, but the law is 15 feet.
[03:15:53.732 --> 03:15:58.275]  And they can dial in and listen to what you're doing even when the cell phone's off.
[03:15:59.275 --> 03:16:06.577]  So it's just a massive system and as insiders told me over a decade ago, the phone companies aren't tapped by the NSA.
[03:16:06.577 --> 03:16:07.877]  They are the NSA.
[03:16:07.877 --> 03:16:12.479]  They have whole floors of their installations where everything goes through it.
[03:16:12.479 --> 03:16:16.200]  It's like radio stations aren't run by FEMA.
[03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:20.521]  FEMA equipment by law is wired in as the last piece of equipment
[03:16:21.081 --> 03:16:21.341]  Yes.
[03:16:21.341 --> 03:16:21.421]  Yes.
[03:16:49.568 --> 03:17:02.536]  Well, since our site is about publicizing information about technological spying, which we've branched into, anything that deals with use of high technology to spy on people is our main meat.
[03:17:02.536 --> 03:17:03.977]  So this fits right into that.
[03:17:03.977 --> 03:17:18.145]  And we get documents regularly, as do other sites, about this because the high technology stuff often is not disclosed about how effective it is, whether it's through browsing or through chat rooms or through various kinds of things that are very popular now at the Facebook sites and things like that.
[03:17:19.096 --> 03:17:25.520]  So Google takes a lot of hits for this, but there are dozens of other sites that are doing the same thing.
[03:17:25.520 --> 03:17:28.942]  But all of them have to run through the telecom system.
[03:17:28.942 --> 03:17:32.244]  So it's the telecoms that have the real control over all this.
[03:17:32.244 --> 03:17:37.407]  And so these agencies go directly to the people who run the technology.
[03:17:37.407 --> 03:17:43.710]  And so Google, for example, couldn't do what it's doing without these vast technological infrastructure.
[03:17:43.710 --> 03:17:46.852]  And so these agencies go directly to the source of the machine
[03:17:48.669 --> 03:17:53.712]  And of course, the specs under federal law, the telecoms are NSA approved and designed.
[03:17:53.712 --> 03:17:56.494]  Cybersecurity Act really expands that, doesn't it?
[03:17:56.494 --> 03:17:59.076]  It does.
[03:17:59.076 --> 03:18:07.041]  They think that this heavy use of digital communication is a threat to national security.
[03:18:07.041 --> 03:18:08.082]  We think that's bombast.
[03:18:09.708 --> 03:18:22.860]  Yeah, they're just getting psychological algorithms to track and manipulate the population and protect their money laundering, drug dealing, a civil admins, FBI translator, whistleblower, running Al Qaeda up until the day of the attacks.
[03:18:22.860 --> 03:18:24.381]  She's having to listen to this.
[03:18:24.381 --> 03:18:27.504]  Child kidnapping rings, that's come out in mainstream news.
[03:18:27.504 --> 03:18:32.429]  Halliburton, DynCorp, just the most criminal organizations the planet's ever seen.
[03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:34.751]  Hit teams, just the worst of the worst.
[03:18:35.351 --> 03:18:37.092]  But I'm ranting here.
[03:18:37.092 --> 03:18:38.312]  You're now challenging this.
[03:18:38.312 --> 03:18:42.793]  You're pointing out that they don't have a copyright on this and it's public interest.
[03:18:42.793 --> 03:18:43.954]  That's correct.
[03:18:43.954 --> 03:18:50.876]  The information is in the public interest to see what the telecoms are doing, which are public-oriented organizations.
[03:18:50.876 --> 03:18:59.239]  They make a big deal about protecting privacy and providing service, and they do not like to talk about selling the service covertly to government agencies.
[03:18:59.239 --> 03:19:00.059]  And they're all doing it.
[03:19:01.903 --> 03:19:05.687]  By the way, some of them do publish this information, but not all.
[03:19:05.687 --> 03:19:09.230]  And so what they try to keep quiet is the money side of it.
[03:19:09.230 --> 03:19:15.275]  That they're doing it is no secret, but it's how much money they're making that is of interest in what they're trying to hide.
[03:19:15.275 --> 03:19:17.797]  And so we think that needs to be known.
[03:19:19.395 --> 03:19:19.975]  Absolutely.
[03:19:19.975 --> 03:19:22.217]  I wanted to bring that up to you earlier.
[03:19:22.217 --> 03:19:24.698]  It's somewhere here in my stack.
[03:19:24.698 --> 03:19:28.540]  I was showing the USA Today from five years ago.
[03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:39.846]  Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery database and then it admits nationwide all the big pizza chains, when you call to get a pizza, run your name, your credit card, your location through a criminal database.
[03:19:40.626 --> 03:19:45.332]  And even for small fines, you get an arrest, not a pizza.
[03:19:45.332 --> 03:19:50.038]  And that's just an example of how everything is being wired in to this system.
[03:19:50.038 --> 03:19:57.347]  We're going to come back and discuss that with our guest, the webmaster, the head guy, John Young at Cryptome.org.
[03:19:57.347 --> 03:19:57.868]  Stay with us.

[03:20:57.985 --> 03:20:59.166]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[03:20:59.166 --> 03:21:02.288]  The best you can buy.
[03:21:02.288 --> 03:21:06.311]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.311 --> 03:21:09.553]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.553 --> 03:21:10.974]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:11.664 --> 03:21:14.345]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.345 --> 03:21:20.726]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.726 --> 03:21:25.928]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:25.928 --> 03:21:29.088]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:21:29.088 --> 03:21:35.910]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.030 --> 03:21:38.371]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.371 --> 03:21:39.972]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:39.972 --> 03:21:42.433]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.433 --> 03:21:44.274]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.274 --> 03:21:49.697]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.697 --> 03:21:58.801]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:01.437 --> 03:22:02.457]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:02.457 --> 03:22:07.979]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:07.979 --> 03:22:08.540]  I get it.
[03:22:08.540 --> 03:22:17.863]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.143 --> 03:22:19.563]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:19.563 --> 03:22:28.026]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.026 --> 03:22:31.427]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:31.427 --> 03:22:35.688]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:35.688 --> 03:22:37.289]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:37.289 --> 03:22:40.690]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:40.690 --> 03:22:44.851]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.051 --> 03:22:45.951]  You should, too.
[03:22:45.951 --> 03:22:47.112]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.112 --> 03:22:50.413]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:50.413 --> 03:22:50.473]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.473 --> 03:22:50.793]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.793 --> 03:22:50.994]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.902 --> 03:23:07.884]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:23:07.884 --> 03:23:09.965]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:23:09.965 --> 03:23:12.205]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:23:12.205 --> 03:23:13.866]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:23:13.866 --> 03:23:18.347]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:23:18.347 --> 03:23:20.608]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:23:20.708 --> 03:23:21.008]  I think?
[03:23:37.486 --> 03:23:37.786]  I think so.
[03:24:04.162 --> 03:24:06.664]  We are back live.
[03:24:06.664 --> 03:24:09.146]  JohnYoungCryptome.org.
[03:24:09.146 --> 03:24:14.931]  C-R-Y-P-T-O-M-E dot O-R-G.
[03:24:14.931 --> 03:24:17.553]  Yahoo's lawyers say, you take that down.
[03:24:17.553 --> 03:24:24.798]  Now we're charging fees for everybody's personal information.
[03:24:24.798 --> 03:24:25.879]  Where do you go from here?
[03:24:27.284 --> 03:24:33.929]  I mean, you again eloquently explained to them that this is a public service, that you have posted this information.
[03:24:33.929 --> 03:24:37.752]  Where do you go from here?
[03:24:37.752 --> 03:24:55.525]  As people look into this, is to start asking that every telecom company set up a privacy oversight board to look into their policies and decide what is confidential and what is for business reasons, what is in the public interest so that we don't have these gray areas of the telecom
[03:24:56.187 --> 03:24:58.689]  Making their own decision without the public being involved.
[03:24:58.689 --> 03:25:03.532]  This is good democratic process to oversee these giant firms.
[03:25:03.532 --> 03:25:04.552]  Some of them have set these up.
[03:25:04.552 --> 03:25:10.816]  Yahoo was burned a couple years ago for revealing information about a Chinese blogger who was arrested, thrown in jail.
[03:25:10.816 --> 03:25:15.659]  They set up a privacy board to deal with international issues, but they don't have a privacy board dealing with U.S.
[03:25:15.659 --> 03:25:16.680]  issues.
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:22.263]  So we think that's what should be done, and that's what we proposed to Yahoo as a way out of their current dilemma with this document we posted.
[03:25:22.955 --> 03:25:31.560]  We happen to think the public should be more involved in what corporate policy is and not have other corporate people sit on these boards who themselves may be involved in the same kind of activity.
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:35.563]  We need disinterested, impartial people looking at this.
[03:25:35.563 --> 03:25:49.391]  So we think that's a good idea because privacy in the digital world right now is greatly at risk because every country that has a large digital infrastructure are passing laws to invade people's privacy more in the use of the Internet and telephones.
[03:25:50.014 --> 03:25:59.498]  Well, a lot of northern European countries, like Finland and others, brag that the government just listens to almost all the calls and tells the people they're doing it.
[03:25:59.498 --> 03:26:06.081]  And Google, three years ago, said, we have patents for the camera and microphone in the computers.
[03:26:06.081 --> 03:26:11.164]  We're going to listen to you in real time and tailor advertising for you.
[03:26:11.164 --> 03:26:12.804]  I mean, they're really throwing it in our face.
[03:26:12.804 --> 03:26:13.905]  And now Eric Schmidt
[03:26:14.585 --> 03:26:22.032]  On CNBC said, hey, you shouldn't be doing anything you're ashamed of and you don't deserve any privacy, basically.
[03:26:22.032 --> 03:26:23.653]  Have you seen that video clip yet?
[03:26:23.653 --> 03:26:28.558]  Well, I have, and of course, I'd just like to say I think this is nonsense.
[03:26:28.558 --> 03:26:33.963]  That this is more of the bombast put out by corporations to say that we have nothing to hide, when in fact they do.
[03:26:33.963 --> 03:26:35.244]  That's the cover story.
[03:26:35.244 --> 03:26:38.146]  They're acting like they don't have anything to hide, but they do have it to hide.
[03:26:38.146 --> 03:26:40.909]  So they seem to be taking responsibility, when in fact they're not.
[03:26:41.872 --> 03:26:44.493]  And Google is doing that, and they all use the same technique.
[03:26:44.493 --> 03:26:48.915]  In fact, they're encouraged to take that technique to seem to be complying, but they're not.
[03:26:48.915 --> 03:26:59.419]  And now they're coming in with really the end of net neutrality, with this Internet 2, where they're going to not upgrade the older hubs, force you onto their new systems.
[03:26:59.419 --> 03:27:06.502]  Microsoft's new operating systems have a thumbprint where you'll have to biometrically get on the web and register yourself.
[03:27:06.502 --> 03:27:09.603]  What is Cryptome seeing in that area?
[03:27:09.603 --> 03:27:11.184]  Well, we think that
[03:27:12.534 --> 03:27:14.155]  It's important to watch what these folks are doing.
[03:27:14.155 --> 03:27:20.317]  You know, they're extremely astute with fantastic lobbyists to shape legislation in their own direction.
[03:27:20.317 --> 03:27:23.838]  That's why we think oversight of what they're doing needs to be involved.
[03:27:23.838 --> 03:27:25.378]  The public cannot leave it to government.
[03:27:25.378 --> 03:27:30.480]  They've now got government eating out of their hands through lobbying firms and by campaign contributions.
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:41.623]  We think we need impartial panels overlooking the public use of these communication services because they're so astute now that they can pull this flim flam through the government.
[03:27:42.611 --> 03:27:48.798]  Because in one of the things they do, in fact scratching each other, they give government secret services for this favorable treatment.
[03:27:48.798 --> 03:27:50.019]  That's what we'd like to expose.
[03:27:55.836 --> 03:28:04.823]  And there's no doubt from your research, as I read the site weekly, that just the amount of surveillance and control is systemic.
[03:28:04.823 --> 03:28:20.976]  I mean, it's just everything's being surveilled, everything's being recorded, and government has gone from saying, oh, we're not engaged in warrantless wiretaps, to being caught lying, to just wide open, yeah, we're listening to everything, get used to it.
[03:28:20.976 --> 03:28:24.459]  Well, one of the techniques that they've evolved is that since
[03:28:25.222 --> 03:28:29.845]  We have a right to get access to government information through FOIA to some extent.
[03:28:29.845 --> 03:28:37.450]  They now use this thing called confidential business information to withhold information about the contractors to government who are running most of these systems.
[03:28:37.450 --> 03:28:39.712]  Government does not run these systems, corporations do.
[03:28:40.325 --> 03:28:45.767]  And they use this term, confidential business information, to withhold information and that's allowed under the law.
[03:28:45.767 --> 03:28:52.569]  That's what Chris Salogian smoked out, is that they were hiding this data using this hack term, confidential business information.
[03:28:52.569 --> 03:28:58.491]  Now that was legislated to protect government's complicity in government spying.
[03:28:58.491 --> 03:29:02.072]  And that's the backscratching that's going on.
[03:29:02.072 --> 03:29:05.133]  So they spy for commercial purposes, but then they sell
[03:29:06.297 --> 03:29:12.399]  Governmental spying to the government, and using the same technology, the same systems, and that's the back-scratching that's going on.
[03:29:12.399 --> 03:29:16.580]  Now, people who work for these companies are the ones who tell us about this.
[03:29:16.580 --> 03:29:22.761]  We don't work there, but the people inside who are running these systems are very disturbed by this duplicity.
[03:29:22.761 --> 03:29:25.162]  And Google is the giant among these people.
[03:29:25.162 --> 03:29:26.202]  Microsoft is another.
[03:29:26.202 --> 03:29:32.004]  These great server forms that are being set up around the world now.
[03:29:32.004 --> 03:29:35.665]  Vast vacuums of everything that's passing through, nearly all communication systems.
[03:29:37.185 --> 03:29:43.627]  And when the San Antonio media tries to go to the new NSA base and just ask questions, the police come out and threaten to arrest them.
[03:29:43.627 --> 03:29:47.769]  Well, I appreciate what Cryptome.org is doing, sir.
[03:29:47.769 --> 03:29:49.990]  And I really want to thank you for spending time with us today.

[03:29:55.312 --> 03:29:58.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:32:00.498 --> 03:32:05.805]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:32:05.805 --> 03:32:10.331]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:32:10.331 --> 03:32:12.614]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:32:12.614 --> 03:32:14.236]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:32:14.236 --> 03:32:15.278]  There is a solution.

[03:33:12.538 --> 03:33:17.040]  Alright, finishing up with John Young of Cryptome.org.
[03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:21.483]  You're gonna beat this Yahoo situation, I'm sure.
[03:33:21.483 --> 03:33:22.843]  Plus, they're coming after you.
[03:33:22.843 --> 03:33:27.266]  They'll only make everybody go get the documents, mirror it in thousands of places.
[03:33:27.266 --> 03:33:29.007]  I mean, can they really do anything legally?
[03:33:29.007 --> 03:33:34.530]  I guess they can sue you, but then that'll just bring more attention to their profiting from Big Brother.
[03:33:34.530 --> 03:33:38.272]  Yeah, and what they try to do is bluff and intimidate people.
[03:33:38.272 --> 03:33:40.833]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a
[03:33:41.357 --> 03:33:47.858]  A very large collection of documents where they've faked claims of copyright to bamboozle people who don't know the law.
[03:33:47.858 --> 03:33:52.719]  And if anyone cares about this, they should go to the EFF site to read about it.
[03:33:52.719 --> 03:33:54.439]  So we think they're bluffing here.
[03:33:54.439 --> 03:33:55.620]  Nonetheless, they can sue.
[03:33:55.620 --> 03:33:57.020]  They're a large corporation.
[03:33:57.020 --> 03:33:57.700]  Fine.
[03:33:57.700 --> 03:33:59.580]  Sue us.
[03:33:59.580 --> 03:34:01.981]  Well, we appreciate your courage, Mr. Young.
[03:34:01.981 --> 03:34:05.021]  And how do people support Cryptome.org?
[03:34:05.021 --> 03:34:07.622]  Well, they can read our site.
[03:34:07.622 --> 03:34:08.542]  It's a public library.
[03:34:09.983 --> 03:34:17.007]  If they feel like taking a look at our archive, we offer that on the site, but mainly this is a public service.
[03:34:17.007 --> 03:34:20.709]  And so if you want to give support, support EFF.
[03:34:20.709 --> 03:34:22.671]  Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[03:34:22.671 --> 03:34:23.771]  That's correct.
[03:34:23.771 --> 03:34:25.472]  That just does an amazing job.
[03:34:25.472 --> 03:34:27.494]  Thank you so much, Mr. Young.
[03:34:27.494 --> 03:34:28.814]  And thank you, Alex.
[03:34:28.814 --> 03:34:29.535]  Appreciate you.
[03:34:31.465 --> 03:34:32.465]  You bet, thank you.
[03:34:32.465 --> 03:34:44.670]  Okay, let me briefly hit healthcare, then I'm going to get into the latest on the carbon scam and the world government meeting that is happening right now in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[03:34:44.670 --> 03:34:48.151]  First off, on healthcare.
[03:34:48.151 --> 03:34:51.672]  This is so ridiculous.
[03:34:51.672 --> 03:34:56.694]  In fact, pull up the Newsweek cover of the case for killing Granny.
[03:34:58.154 --> 03:35:07.377]  And then if you can, pull up that ABC News article where they're teaching kids to commit suicide by 11 because their carbon footprint runs out at that time.
[03:35:07.377 --> 03:35:13.360]  I want to have those ready whenever I get into what's really behind the carbon tax.
[03:35:13.360 --> 03:35:14.980]  From their own words.
[03:35:14.980 --> 03:35:16.041]  From their own statements.
[03:35:16.041 --> 03:35:17.001]  I want people to hear this.
[03:35:18.646 --> 03:35:31.755]  But before I hit the healthcare issue, on the issue of Schmidt at Google saying, you know, none of our stuff really should be private and so what, you know, don't think it's private, don't have anything to hide, what do you have to hide?
[03:35:31.755 --> 03:35:35.958]  Meanwhile, you can't find where the Google CEOs and other top executives live.
[03:35:35.958 --> 03:35:37.539]  They blocked that out of their system.
[03:35:37.539 --> 03:35:39.140]  Here is AP today.
[03:35:39.580 --> 03:35:41.401]  Promises, promises.
[03:35:41.401 --> 03:35:43.942]  A closed meeting on openness.
[03:35:43.942 --> 03:35:48.104]  It's hardly the image of transparency the Obama administration wants to project.
[03:35:48.104 --> 03:35:51.786]  A workshop on government openness is closed to the public.
[03:35:51.786 --> 03:35:55.989]  And then it goes into how they're one of the most secretive administrations since Nixon.
[03:35:55.989 --> 03:35:59.630]  And he makes it secret who goes to the White House and everything else.
[03:35:59.630 --> 03:36:02.972]  It's just incredible.
[03:36:02.972 --> 03:36:07.314]  So there is some of the news on that front.
[03:36:07.314 --> 03:36:08.295]  Okay, on healthcare.
[03:36:10.216 --> 03:36:12.638]  There it is, the case for killing Granny.
[03:36:12.638 --> 03:36:20.946]  And literally, I take Newsweek, every issue has an article about how great euthanasia is, or how good it is that people committed suicide.
[03:36:20.946 --> 03:36:22.228]  You know, is it good?
[03:36:22.228 --> 03:36:23.369]  Well, it is loving.
[03:36:23.369 --> 03:36:25.931]  His wife was sick, so he went ahead and killed himself too.
[03:36:27.523 --> 03:36:33.626]  And Tom Daschle wrote a book and he wrote the original health care bill saying above 60 you don't get eye surgery.
[03:36:33.626 --> 03:36:35.107]  That's for young people.
[03:36:35.107 --> 03:36:37.508]  Teaching you the pie is only so big.
[03:36:37.508 --> 03:36:43.011]  And if you're going to get ahead as a young yuppie, you've got to be for getting rid of this aging population.
[03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:54.256]  And in the bill it says 2.5 to 5 percent of your check will be taken for the new health care and quarter million dollar fines, five years in prison if you don't get the insurance.
[03:36:54.256 --> 03:36:56.078]  That's in the bill.
[03:36:56.078 --> 03:37:01.302]  And they've got tens of billions a year cuts in Medicaid.
[03:37:01.302 --> 03:37:06.005]  Forty-one billion dollar a year cut in Medicare.
[03:37:06.005 --> 03:37:07.026]  And that's conservative.
[03:37:09.398 --> 03:37:14.682]  And I get emails saying, you're an evil Republican, when I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.
[03:37:14.682 --> 03:37:16.384]  You work for the insurance companies.
[03:37:17.003 --> 03:37:17.683]  Every day!
[03:37:17.683 --> 03:37:19.424]  And we get phone calls on air sometimes.
[03:37:19.424 --> 03:37:21.364]  I mean, you've heard it, you see it.
[03:37:21.364 --> 03:37:39.429]  When it was in Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago that the healthcare industry and their top lobbyists for the insurance companies were going to pull out of support of the healthcare bill three weeks ago because Obama, under pressure from Democrats, wasn't going to make the cuts and wasn't going to force you to get insurance.
[03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:46.011]  Denis Kucinich, who I don't agree with politically on a lot of issues, but at least he's honest, I respect him, is an admitted socialist.
[03:37:47.313 --> 03:38:00.659]  And he wrote an article titled, you can pull this up, on his own congressional website, Health Care Plan is a bailout for insurance companies.
[03:38:00.659 --> 03:38:01.300]  And it is.
[03:38:01.300 --> 03:38:03.061]  They wrote it.
[03:38:03.061 --> 03:38:11.705]  Just like Dutch Rochelle, and it's in the emails, and BP and ExxonMobil are on record pushing the global climate tax.
[03:38:13.430 --> 03:38:18.031]  And then people say, oh, you work for the oil companies because you're against the tax.
[03:38:18.031 --> 03:38:30.315]  That's like the Federal Reserve and newspapers they controlled or owned ran articles by the banks sponsored by them saying we don't want the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 when it was for them.
[03:38:30.315 --> 03:38:31.575]  That's a simple trick.
[03:38:31.575 --> 03:38:33.656]  There's so many tricks they use.
[03:38:33.656 --> 03:38:38.757]  The insurance companies write the health care bill as a new tax to them.
[03:38:38.757 --> 03:38:41.998]  It's like insurance companies lobby that you should have to get more and more car insurance.
[03:38:44.346 --> 03:38:45.487]  But I wanted to go over that.
[03:38:45.487 --> 03:38:47.448]  Shell, cap-and-trade is a good thing.
[03:38:47.448 --> 03:38:52.451]  You know, I've got all these other articles where they're all behind it.
[03:38:52.451 --> 03:39:00.597]  And now it's come out in the hacked emails from the East Anglia University, the head UN climate facility.
[03:39:00.597 --> 03:39:02.138]  So this is what they're doing.
[03:39:03.547 --> 03:39:07.329]  Now, here is the article from Newsweek, The Case for Killing Granny.
[03:39:07.329 --> 03:39:08.169]  Here's another one.
[03:39:08.169 --> 03:39:11.310]  ABC website tells kids when they should die.
[03:39:11.310 --> 03:39:16.712]  InfoWars has a link to the article where you can read it in the News of Australia.
[03:39:16.712 --> 03:39:18.193]  And blow up that image.
[03:39:18.193 --> 03:39:20.654]  They tell the kids that little animals are dying.
[03:39:21.434 --> 03:39:30.179]  And that their carbon credits run out at age 11, so you should basically kill yourself, that you're not supposed to live past age 11.
[03:39:30.179 --> 03:39:34.442]  I mean, this is the level of the eugenicist.
[03:39:34.442 --> 03:39:37.283]  This is what is behind all of this.
[03:39:37.283 --> 03:39:39.044]  I've done the research.
[03:39:39.044 --> 03:39:41.886]  I made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:39:42.543 --> 03:39:43.804]  The Rockefeller Endowment.
[03:39:43.804 --> 03:39:45.666]  The Carnegie Endowment.
[03:39:45.666 --> 03:39:48.629]  The IBM started as a eugenics front.
[03:39:48.629 --> 03:39:50.891]  Hitler supporting all these groups.
[03:39:50.891 --> 03:39:56.737]  Hitler learned everything from the British and the US.
[03:39:56.737 --> 03:39:59.620]  It's just that he only wanted to kill certain races.
[03:39:59.620 --> 03:40:01.802]  The globalists say, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:40:01.802 --> 03:40:04.985]  We're going to kill 80% of the world population.
[03:40:06.192 --> 03:40:09.014]  That's what Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers.
[03:40:09.014 --> 03:40:12.537]  In fact, I had you guys print me Maury Strong quotes.
[03:40:12.537 --> 03:40:29.290]  I mean, my only problem is I have too much, too much evidence of all of this information, too much information to even be able to keep track of this anymore.
[03:40:29.290 --> 03:40:33.053]  Will you ask Aaron to print me that InfoWars list of Maury Strong quotes again?
[03:40:34.679 --> 03:40:36.001]  Ask him to print me that immediately.
[03:40:36.001 --> 03:40:37.462]  I mean, there's just so much.
[03:40:37.462 --> 03:40:39.204]  You know what I'm going to do?
[03:40:39.204 --> 03:40:41.847]  I am just going to, and highlight them again, thank you.
[03:40:41.847 --> 03:40:42.448]  Oh no, here it is.
[03:40:42.448 --> 03:40:42.968]  I found it.
[03:40:42.968 --> 03:40:43.329]  I found it.
[03:40:43.329 --> 03:40:44.410]  It's over here.
[03:40:44.410 --> 03:40:48.374]  Let me just read to you, and of course, don't believe us.
[03:40:48.374 --> 03:40:52.960]  When we post this, you know, when I read in
[03:40:54.537 --> 03:41:02.162]  Pulitzer Prize winning publications and books, in one particular one, about IBM and Margaret Sanger, I didn't believe them.
[03:41:02.162 --> 03:41:09.227]  I sent off to the University Archives and got the letters where she said, we've got to exterminate these black weeds.
[03:41:09.227 --> 03:41:10.707]  How do we kill these blacks?
[03:41:10.707 --> 03:41:11.748]  How do we sterilize them?
[03:41:11.748 --> 03:41:13.709]  How do we kill them?
[03:41:13.709 --> 03:41:14.410]  You know, 9 out of 10.
[03:41:15.745 --> 03:41:16.946]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:41:16.946 --> 03:41:20.287]  More black babies are aborted every year than are born.
[03:41:20.287 --> 03:41:24.529]  But it's liberal and loving to see Margaret Sanger being thanked by Hitler in speeches.
[03:41:24.529 --> 03:41:26.690]  And she's still Woman of the Year.
[03:41:26.690 --> 03:41:31.532]  One of the most important women of the century in Time Magazine.
[03:41:31.532 --> 03:41:35.473]  Now, this is Maury Strong, founder of the UN Environment Program, 1992, at Rio de Janeiro, speaking.
[03:41:40.672 --> 03:41:45.276]  It isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse.
[03:41:45.276 --> 03:41:47.638]  Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?
[03:41:47.638 --> 03:41:50.600]  Maurice Strong, founder of the UN Environment Program.
[03:41:50.600 --> 03:42:05.192]  What did the co-author of this book, one of the previous science advisors to George Bush Senior, and best buddies who's co-written five books with John P. Holdren, Ecoscience, talking about sterilizing you,
[03:42:06.465 --> 03:42:11.633]  What did Paul Ehrlich, professor of population studies say?
[03:42:11.633 --> 03:42:15.219]  A massive campaign must be launched to de-develop the United States.
[03:42:15.219 --> 03:42:20.488]  De-development means bringing our economic system into line with the realities of ecology and world
[03:42:21.314 --> 03:42:29.920]  Resource situation and they go on in these documents to say we're going to do this by taxing carbon And we're going to tell people that carbon dioxide is bad.
[03:42:29.920 --> 03:42:31.721]  What did the EPA announce today?
[03:42:31.721 --> 03:42:45.471]  They're going to list it as a toxic waste In line with the Copenhagen initiative the global government treaty which the head of the UN and the head of the euro the European Union state is the control system for neo-feudalistic world government
[03:42:47.674 --> 03:42:50.257]  Professor Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University.
[03:42:50.257 --> 03:42:56.204]  Given society's cheap, abundant energy, would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun.
[03:42:57.489 --> 03:43:00.051]  Dave Foreman, co-founder of Earth First.
[03:43:00.051 --> 03:43:11.658]  The three main goals must be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial infrastructure and the wilderness, with its full component of species returning throughout the world.
[03:43:11.658 --> 03:43:14.300]  And I can go on for hours reading you these quotes.
[03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:21.264]  I mean, Ted Turner, a total population of 250-300 million people and 95% for present levels would be ideal.
[03:43:21.264 --> 03:43:23.346]  That was on CNN, he said that.
[03:43:25.694 --> 03:43:33.780]  And then, of course, you read the Human Genome Project caught red-handed developing cancer viruses that they then add to the vaccines.
[03:43:33.780 --> 03:43:36.002]  Caught red-handed!
[03:43:36.002 --> 03:43:41.666]  I mean, these people are so devastatingly evil, and they're just frothing.
[03:43:41.666 --> 03:43:48.451]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates' dad, former head of Planned Parenthood, Bill Gates, Bill Moyers talking about population reduction.
[03:43:48.451 --> 03:43:51.113]  These people mean devastating business.
[03:43:53.024 --> 03:43:55.568]  And all these fool yuppies, I talked to them.
[03:43:56.653 --> 03:44:17.766]  And they say, well, anybody making over 200, 300,000 a year, especially in any elite city like Austin, New York, LA, you know, my dad's a dentist and he's been invited to some elite meetings with some pretty big people, dinners, and they won't go to them because they're both, they're giving them the books they wrote about world population reduction and talking about how they want to kill everyone.
[03:44:17.766 --> 03:44:25.411]  My dad, who was in high school, one of the top of his class, they sent him to a UT advanced project when he was a junior and senior.
[03:44:25.891 --> 03:44:28.934]  They called him in to these meetings.
[03:44:28.934 --> 03:44:32.457]  Out of the 125 they selected, he was in the top six smartest.
[03:44:32.457 --> 03:44:39.362]  And Professor Speer called him in and said, you need to be involved in government.
[03:44:39.362 --> 03:44:41.704]  We need to be involved in eugenics.
[03:44:41.704 --> 03:44:43.146]  Speer said, I'm Jewish.
[03:44:43.146 --> 03:44:46.208]  Hitler had it wrong wanting to only get rid of certain groups.
[03:44:46.208 --> 03:44:48.050]  It's actually all the bad people.
[03:44:48.050 --> 03:44:50.412]  I mean, this isn't me reading government documents.
[03:44:50.412 --> 03:44:53.835]  My dad can't go to cocktail parties with rich people.
[03:44:54.693 --> 03:44:56.034]  Without having to hear about it.
[03:44:56.034 --> 03:44:56.895]  It's all you hear.
[03:44:56.895 --> 03:45:00.758]  You talk to these stupid yuppies, and they go, oh, there are too many people.
[03:45:00.758 --> 03:45:01.759]  We do need to get rid of people.
[03:45:01.759 --> 03:45:06.022]  It's kind of like Thrill's little power trip view of the world.
[03:45:06.022 --> 03:45:07.703]  It makes them feel important.
[03:45:07.703 --> 03:45:10.125]  You know, pressing on the nerve of power.
[03:45:10.125 --> 03:45:13.548]  Don't you idiots know you're being targeted as well?
[03:45:13.548 --> 03:45:16.830]  Eugenics isn't what you're taught in school of positive and negative.
[03:45:16.830 --> 03:45:19.692]  Advancing the healthier, smarter specimens.
[03:45:19.692 --> 03:45:21.614]  Culling the dumb ones, which is bad enough.
[03:45:22.978 --> 03:45:29.262]  It actually, the next tier of eugenics, when you deeply read, is targeting the intelligence groups.
[03:45:29.262 --> 03:45:31.723]  It's targeting the wild sons.
[03:45:31.723 --> 03:45:33.564]  The bad sons, as they call them.
[03:45:33.564 --> 03:45:40.649]  The people that, the middle class wild seed, they call it, that has the genetic complement to challenge the elite.
[03:45:40.649 --> 03:45:42.510]  I mean, these people are sick.
[03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:49.454]  They're putting cancer viruses, they've been caught, the UN's been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[03:45:49.454 --> 03:45:50.495]  I mean, the SV
[03:45:52.843 --> 03:45:57.824]  40 human papillomaviruses, all of this they've been caught.
[03:45:57.824 --> 03:46:01.665]  The Salk vaccine knowingly was in there.
[03:46:01.665 --> 03:46:04.966]  We have videos of Salk and others bragging and laughing about it.
[03:46:04.966 --> 03:46:07.206]  I mean, this is so evil!
[03:46:07.206 --> 03:46:19.589]  And you've got all these fools that think they're part of the power structure and who think this is all cute and funny and they've been let in on the inside track and they've been let in on the big secret and it's so much fun.
[03:46:22.432 --> 03:46:27.114]  So, at this United Nations Climate Change Conference, we've gone over the 200-page treaty here.
[03:46:27.114 --> 03:46:29.515]  Global governance, world government.
[03:46:29.515 --> 03:46:33.457]  Cue up Van Rompuy again for everybody.
[03:46:33.457 --> 03:46:41.520]  They say that this will be a planetary government first targeting the Western nations that already have 1.2 child replacements.
[03:46:42.608 --> 03:46:47.552]  The Western nations, on average, have 1.3 children.
[03:46:47.552 --> 03:46:49.473]  For every two people, 1.3.
[03:46:49.473 --> 03:46:50.414]  Japan's dying.
[03:46:50.414 --> 03:46:51.855]  Italy's dying.
[03:46:51.855 --> 03:46:53.056]  Germany's dying.
[03:46:53.056 --> 03:46:55.057]  The United States is dying.
[03:46:55.057 --> 03:46:58.940]  All the original Western populations are dying.
[03:46:58.940 --> 03:46:59.441]  They're dying!
[03:47:01.363 --> 03:47:05.206]  All the major populations are dying, and that's exactly what the globalists want.
[03:47:05.206 --> 03:47:07.127]  That's the first group they want wiped out.
[03:47:07.127 --> 03:47:13.231]  But they're also running soft-kill operations on Africans, Latin Americans, Pacific Islanders, everybody.
[03:47:13.231 --> 03:47:14.012]  And they've been caught.
[03:47:14.012 --> 03:47:21.057]  I mean, just document after document after document after document that we cover in my film, Endgame, where they just admit they're doing this to everyone.
[03:47:22.708 --> 03:47:24.389]  And then now, here's the New York Times.
[03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:26.611]  EPA sets carbon crackdown.
[03:47:26.611 --> 03:47:31.394]  They're going to tax carbon dioxide, everything, listing it as a toxic waste.
[03:47:31.394 --> 03:47:34.877]  ABC News.
[03:47:34.877 --> 03:47:36.478]  ABC News, right here.
[03:47:36.478 --> 03:47:41.682]  EPA greenhouse gases endanger human health.
[03:47:44.281 --> 03:47:48.828]  And they list all the other gases like methane that cows have flatulence.
[03:47:48.828 --> 03:47:50.810]  New Zealand in places have already passed laws.
[03:47:50.810 --> 03:47:57.359]  Canada's passing laws to tax any type of animal that releases methane.
[03:47:57.359 --> 03:47:59.963]  Sheep, cows, chickens, goats.
[03:47:59.963 --> 03:48:00.504]  Everything!
[03:48:00.504 --> 03:48:00.844]  Geese!
[03:48:02.156 --> 03:48:09.457]  Schwarzenegger couldn't get the legislature to pass it, so he just said, I'm banning TVs above 40 inches and putting taxes on all others.
[03:48:09.457 --> 03:48:14.198]  Total feudalism, total serfdom is now unfolding.
[03:48:14.198 --> 03:48:26.321]  And all of this being done in line, Obama administration will formally declare danger of carbon emissions, including carbon dioxide, to be listed as a toxic waste.
[03:48:29.423 --> 03:48:33.625]  It only takes a majority to create the treaty, and Obama's going to sign on.
[03:48:33.625 --> 03:48:37.466]  You watch.
[03:48:37.466 --> 03:48:51.351]  But then, even if they don't ratify it in the Senate, the states, through federal bureaucracy, which is under UNESCO that Bush signed us back onto, United Nations Educational Cultural Organization, they are integrating this everywhere at the state level.
[03:48:51.351 --> 03:48:53.552]  Last week, the internal UN documents came out.
[03:48:54.352 --> 03:49:05.639]  CNN, AP, they all covered it like it was a good thing and said, oh yes, the UN has a global program in all the public schools with grade children teaching them to educate their parents, to rebuke their parents.
[03:49:05.639 --> 03:49:11.783]  New York Times described kids telling their parents, writing them fake tickets about taking hot baths.
[03:49:11.783 --> 03:49:13.784]  Next, they can have them spy on them for terrorism.
[03:49:13.784 --> 03:49:15.025]  They're already doing that.
[03:49:15.025 --> 03:49:18.147]  They're recruiting the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts for Homeland Security.
[03:49:18.147 --> 03:49:20.749]  I mean, this is just Orwell on steroids.
[03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:23.990]  I just can't believe it.
[03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:29.212]  And it just goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[03:49:29.212 --> 03:49:51.337]  And the good news is, though, these emails got hacked, they got released to the media six weeks ago, the media wouldn't cover it, so they got then released to universities, and it's them and their admitting, oh my gosh, the Earth's getting cooler, we've gotta hide this, we've gotta hide the decline, we've gotta persecute scientists, we've gotta get them fired, we've gotta keep them from getting their papers published, we've gotta keep this out of the IPCC report.
[03:49:52.217 --> 03:49:55.298]  We've got to get with the government to block these FOIA requests.
[03:49:55.298 --> 03:49:58.820]  The government is helping us block people from getting this.
[03:49:58.820 --> 03:50:00.700]  Oh, we've got to work with Goddard Space Center.
[03:50:00.700 --> 03:50:02.501]  We've got to work with the UN to hide it.
[03:50:02.501 --> 03:50:16.146]  The three head climate facilities in England, the United States, and Germany, all working together, the three that they draw from, and then you see the UN say, yes, this has been very damaging to our program.
[03:50:17.188 --> 03:50:25.452]  These emails coming out, but thank God that we still have the peer-reviewed journals that prove global warming's real.
[03:50:25.452 --> 03:50:33.116]  When the very peer-reviewed journals are using the data from the UN Climate Index that they integrated, that they created.
[03:50:35.026 --> 03:50:38.167]  But the good news is, I've got an article here with the head of the U.N.
[03:50:38.167 --> 03:50:40.847]  saying this has been devastating to them.
[03:50:40.847 --> 03:50:46.309]  And so the good news is, this pseudoscience, this fraud, is being exposed.
[03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:51.250]  And we spend an hour in my new two-plus-hour film, Fall of the Republic, exposing this.
[03:50:51.250 --> 03:51:00.132]  It's free on YouTube, free on Google, just Google it, email it to everybody you know, get the DVD at InfoWars.com, make copies, expose the scum.
[03:51:01.493 --> 03:51:05.717]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[03:51:18.989 --> 03:51:19.250]  I think?
[03:51:38.092 --> 03:51:42.256]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:51:42.256 --> 03:51:47.301]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:51:47.301 --> 03:51:51.486]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:51:51.486 --> 03:51:53.267]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:51:53.267 --> 03:51:57.872]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:52:02.725 --> 03:52:06.754]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.754 --> 03:52:09.980]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.980 --> 03:52:11.403]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.105 --> 03:52:14.788]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.788 --> 03:52:21.174]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.174 --> 03:52:26.238]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.238 --> 03:52:36.368]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.468 --> 03:52:38.809]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.809 --> 03:52:40.410]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.410 --> 03:52:42.851]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.851 --> 03:52:44.711]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:44.711 --> 03:52:50.134]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:54:22.296 --> 03:54:23.817]  Alright, it's the final segment.
[03:54:23.817 --> 03:54:29.439]  We've got Lord Mompton on tomorrow from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[03:54:29.439 --> 03:54:30.539]  Very excited about that.
[03:54:30.539 --> 03:54:34.821]  He's reportedly going to give us a full hour, but he's joining us from a cell phone on the ground.
[03:54:34.821 --> 03:54:36.702]  That should be interesting.
[03:54:36.702 --> 03:54:40.483]  His report that I've read several times is devastating.
[03:54:40.483 --> 03:54:42.264]  Climategate caught green-handed.
[03:54:42.264 --> 03:54:49.306]  You can go to Infowars.com and link through to it or go directly to his website and get it.
[03:54:49.306 --> 03:54:50.487]  Everyone needs to see this.
[03:54:52.128 --> 03:55:03.152]  This program of enslavement, this scientific dictatorship can only stand if we don't get the word out and resist it.
[03:55:03.152 --> 03:55:05.092]  If we do, it's over.
[03:55:05.092 --> 03:55:12.335]  It's so diabolical, so evil, so wide-reaching that that's why it's hard for people to deal with it.
[03:55:12.335 --> 03:55:14.336]  Like, the guys just gave me some more quotes.
[03:55:14.336 --> 03:55:15.116]  We sent off
[03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:38.820]  And ordered, if I was an animal, and owned the book, cost several hundred dollars, written back in 1988, a foreword by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, one of the founders of the World Wildlife Fund, with the former Nazi, of course, the Dutch Prince, founder of Bilderberg Group.
[03:55:38.820 --> 03:55:44.723]  If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
[03:55:44.723 --> 03:55:45.243]  Prince Philip.
[03:55:47.346 --> 03:55:53.835]  Here's another quote, it doesn't matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.
[03:55:53.835 --> 03:55:55.878]  That's Paul Watson, co-founder of Greenpeace.
[03:55:55.878 --> 03:56:00.645]  I mean, that's the kind of things that these people are saying and doing.
[03:56:04.355 --> 03:56:23.024]  And now the UN, I meant to get to that today, I'll cover it more tomorrow, on the UN website says, world religion, Al Gore is launching it, that was in the 1996 biological diversity assessment, where they just calmly talk about how ancient cultures had it right with war and human sacrifice and pestilence.
[03:56:23.024 --> 03:56:25.225]  We need to bring that back.
[03:56:25.225 --> 03:56:27.826]  What did State Department memorandum 200 say?
[03:56:27.826 --> 03:56:29.987]  Henry Kissinger, CIA memorandum.
[03:56:32.051 --> 03:56:36.294]  As well, it was declassified under the State Department.
[03:56:36.294 --> 03:56:43.740]  He said, we need to tie IMF and World Bank money to the third world, to them reducing their population and their births by at least 50%.
[03:56:43.740 --> 03:56:48.424]  We'll also use war and famine to get the job done.
[03:56:48.424 --> 03:56:54.609]  And he also proposed people, if they didn't cut their food intake, wouldn't get IMF and World Bank funds, which is just made up out of nowhere.
[03:56:54.609 --> 03:56:56.110]  It's the case for killing granny.
[03:56:57.145 --> 03:57:02.329]  These control freaks see the world as theirs and they don't like us eating up their resources.
[03:57:02.329 --> 03:57:07.332]  They want the Hitlerian living space for themselves.
[03:57:07.332 --> 03:57:10.234]  They believe that they are God.
[03:57:10.234 --> 03:57:12.896]  They believe that we need to get out of the way for them.
[03:57:14.056 --> 03:57:19.302]  But the good news is, two weeks into ClimateGate, the establishment tried to ignore this, they tried to laugh at it.
[03:57:19.302 --> 03:57:22.485]  Now, governments are calling for investigations.
[03:57:22.485 --> 03:57:25.408]  More and more criminality is coming out.
[03:57:25.408 --> 03:57:28.191]  In Australia, the carbon tax failed last week.
[03:57:28.191 --> 03:57:30.433]  Members of the government are resigning.
[03:57:30.433 --> 03:57:36.540]  The opposition party to the carbon tax has now become second-in-command, frontbenchers in the parliament.
[03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:39.711]  People are now finding out.
[03:57:39.711 --> 03:57:42.533]  It isn't just a bunch of stupid tree-huggers that were wrong.
[03:57:42.533 --> 03:57:43.994]  They knowingly lied.
[03:57:43.994 --> 03:57:45.616]  They knowingly are eugenicists.
[03:57:45.616 --> 03:57:49.298]  They're knowingly complete and total sickos.
[03:57:49.298 --> 03:57:54.122]  The people are waking up now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:54.122 --> 03:57:59.486]  The people are beginning to find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:06.032]  The people are now ready to see endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:58:06.032 --> 03:58:10.974]  Whatever you do, get the YouTube, get the Google of this, email it to everyone you know.
[03:58:10.974 --> 03:58:12.554]  Don't stop!
[03:58:12.554 --> 03:58:15.875]  So you want to understand ClimateGate and the next level of this?
[03:58:15.875 --> 03:58:18.016]  What the UN says it's about?
[03:58:18.016 --> 03:58:23.318]  It's about cutting off your resources, then taking your kids, raising them in dormitories and sterilizing them.
[03:58:23.318 --> 03:58:27.899]  It's the Chinese one-child policy that the US and England paid them to implement in 1981.
[03:58:29.480 --> 03:58:31.922]  As part of a secret treaty now declassified.
[03:58:31.922 --> 03:58:33.103]  Great job crew.
[03:58:33.103 --> 03:58:35.526]  Retransmission, jam patch starts now.
[03:58:35.526 --> 03:58:38.568]  Jesse Ventura, Lord Monckton and others live tomorrow.
[03:58:38.568 --> 03:58:43.113]  Be sure and join us.
[03:58:43.113 --> 03:58:45.735]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:50.922 --> 03:58:55.463]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:55.463 --> 03:58:56.363]  Number one.
[03:58:56.363 --> 03:58:59.804]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:58:59.804 --> 03:59:00.644]  Number two.
[03:59:00.644 --> 03:59:05.546]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:05.546 --> 03:59:06.286]  It's true.
[03:59:06.286 --> 03:59:10.847]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.167 --> 03:59:11.987]  Number 3.
[03:59:11.987 --> 03:59:15.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:15.568 --> 03:59:19.489]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:19.489 --> 03:59:20.289]  Number 4.
[03:59:20.289 --> 03:59:23.030]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:26.711]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.711 --> 03:59:27.511]  Number 5.
[03:59:27.511 --> 03:59:31.652]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:31.652 --> 03:59:36.413]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
