[00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.723]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:11.304]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:12.865]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:17.047]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:21.109]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:35.725]  Yeah.
[00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:39.305]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.947]  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:46.410]  It is Friday, the 27th day of March 2009.
[00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.155]  We have our weekly financial update with Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster joining us in one hour.
[00:00:53.155 --> 00:01:02.703]  Then we have Dr. Whitaker, just an amazing researcher on the causes and solutions to disease, malnutrition, and the medical sins that are killing the world.
[00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:06.726]  His book is Medicine, and it just gets into just the amazing
[00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:12.831]  Interesting here, I also see that I have an interview coming up after the show with the Huffington Post.
[00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:14.172]  I wonder what they want to talk about?
[00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:32.829]  And a bunch of radio interviews tonight, I tell you.
[00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.035]  I don't feel too wicked, but I guess the saying, no rest for the wicked, we're all fallen.
[00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:43.104]  And there is no rest for those, I guess, trying to fight the good fight against the wicked.
[00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:45.827]  So I guess that goes both ways.
[00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:52.400]  Okay, I am trying to ferret this out because there's so many bills.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.707]  There's five different bills in the House that have language about compulsory national service, and different variants of it.
[00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:06.630]  The House and Senate passed versions into conference that had language
[00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:08.091]  Concerning
[00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:33.425]  You know, they're being attached to hundreds and hundreds of other bills and larger packages as it's debated along with the budget.
[00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:36.527]  And so we'll get to the bottom of this hopefully by the end of the show today.
[00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:40.348]  I got Watson, Paul Watson and others on that situation.
[00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:46.389]  Financial experts say recession ends by year's end.
[00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.671]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:59.781]  This is the same group of private Federal Reserve bankers and the same corrupt Treasury Department that has been telling us for years and years that, oh, we're not in a recession.
[00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:03.624]  And then they finally came out and said, okay, we've been in a recession for the last few years.
[00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:09.910]  Well, now, according to every benchmark, three consecutive quarters of contraction, we're into
[00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:24.910]  Six quarters of contraction or a year and a half, three quarters of a continual contraction with the economy shrinking and job losses is a depression.
[00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.411]  It is depression type numbers.
[00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:34.133]  Now, it somehow could be reversed, but it won't be reversed setting up a new bank of the world and a new global currency.
[00:03:35.188 --> 00:03:43.275]  Now finally, it's on the Nightly News, Fox, CNN, CBS Nightly News, AP, Reuters, just everywhere.
[00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:45.877]  Hundreds of articles last week.
[00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:50.181]  The UN calling for a world currency issued by the IMF and World Bank together.
[00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.020]  Now, I want to explain something here.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.741]  We already have a world currency.
[00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:04.604]  The private Federal Reserve is just the regional shareholder of the larger global banking system that's private.
[00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:12.267]  A select group of less than 15 families that own the central banks of Europe, England, and the United States.
[00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:20.811]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Switzerland, the list goes on and on.
[00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:37.094]  And any nation you see having rebels financed to overthrow it by the West, any nation you see with CIA coups, or MI6 funded coups, or Mossad funded coups, that's a nation that hasn't allowed the private banks to come in and take over their issuance of currency.
[00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:39.255]  So we already have the world currency.
[00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:43.657]  They're already issuing IMF and World Bank monetization.
[00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:50.451]  Just fiat money they create out of nowhere, and they go out and buy the other sub-currencies with that.
[00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:56.200]  So, they just want to make you accept their new global currency and track everything you do.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.005]  We'll break that down in a lot more powerful transmission lined up for you today.
[00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:06.788]  With an economy that continues to plummet, many of us will have to make the difficult decision to cut back on our expenses.
[00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:09.910]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.677]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, a weak immune system, or just always feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:22.202]  The philosophy at Shentrition is to feed the body what it needs, plus heal the body with food.
[00:05:22.942 --> 00:05:35.655]  One scoop a day with water, milk or juice will have you feeling better in no time, giving you more stamina and energy, helping to alleviate stress, boosting your natural healing power, strengthen your immune system, and it tastes great too.
[00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:37.016]  Chantrition is all natural.
[00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:41.750]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:12.971]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:19.476]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:21.458]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:23.920]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:34.809]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:38.755]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:40.616]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:47.521]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.521 --> 00:06:55.786]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:57.367]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.367 --> 00:06:58.548]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.302 --> 00:07:01.665]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:04.090]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.259]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.304]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:16.894]  For the rest of you, go to
[00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:43.828]  I think so.
[00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:08.765]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:12.869]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:16.092]  Okay, we've got three hours and 52 minutes spanning out before us.
[00:08:16.092 --> 00:08:18.274]  Bob Chapman with his weekly visit coming up, and then Dr.
[00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:32.294]  Whitaker will be joining us, author of Medicine, to really bring on some hardcore information about how the main medical system is basically a biological chemical warfare system to carry out eugenics against the people.
[00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:40.520]  The doctors are compartmentalized, the nurses are compartmentalized, but we have all the Rockefeller Foundation documents, UN documents, it's all a giant eugenics operation.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.801]  Bill and Melinda Gates, all of it.
[00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:55.198]  They're foundation very wicked and I happen to have a story here a mainstream news article that I want to get to later when he's on with us where they're panicking.
[00:08:56.167 --> 00:09:03.131]  In places like the Ukraine, close to half the population is refusing to take vaccines.
[00:09:03.131 --> 00:09:08.294]  And the citizens there are not under the total mind control like the American people are and the British are.
[00:09:08.294 --> 00:09:11.195]  They're saying, look, people keep dying when they take these shots.
[00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:12.936]  People keep getting cancer.
[00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:18.539]  People keep... There's been a bunch of vaccine trials there that kill the people that take them.
[00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.761]  They read the news about people dying in mass of the HPV shot.
[00:09:22.642 --> 00:09:29.076]  uh... here as well in the united states and all all over africa all over the world
[00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:32.010]  People are refusing.
[00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.772]  In India, they won't take it.
[00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:52.387]  And so now the United Nations and others are moving to try to engineer pharmacological crops, which they've had for decades, but to force you to take vaccines that will be put in, well not even put, they will biologically grow in the plants.
[00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:55.216]  And I've got other stories here.
[00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:58.398]  Proposed law would require flu shots for preschoolers.
[00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:06.984]  I mean, this is the type of just out-of-control news and information that we have coming up later in the show today.
[00:10:06.984 --> 00:10:16.492]  When you watch the different pre-G20 meetings that are happening in the councils of Europe, in the United States, in Congress.
[00:10:16.492 --> 00:10:18.233]  I was watching C-SPAN hearings yesterday.
[00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:32.319]  They are openly announcing a new global currency.
[00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:36.020]  And this is the heart of world government.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.461]  This is the key to world government.
[00:10:45.350 --> 00:11:08.893]  If you are a private group of banks and you can openly, publicly issue your own currency worldwide, you can buy up any country you want, any industry you want, you can buy off militaries, you can buy off the media, and that's what they've already done stealthily through the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England that are privately owned.
[00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:17.962]  But they did a scam where the government gets the permission to issue the currency and liquidity, and then they pay interest to the bankers.
[00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:19.243]  Well, that isn't enough for the bankers.
[00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:23.385]  They are going to, in whole, issue the currency themselves.
[00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:34.944]  And then you will pay taxes to them for the right to use their currency and so you will pay in whole for quote $1 that will be in a global unit.
[00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:38.187]  You will pay for that dollar and you will pay interest on that dollar.
[00:11:38.187 --> 00:11:40.829]  But more importantly the bankers can then restrict the value
[00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:41.970]  Of course.
[00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:04.080]  But they still want to have regional currencies they control that are based on the super currency.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:11.907]  They're just local units of that so they can rise one currency and lower another to create havoc in the markets and consolidate power as well.
[00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:14.089]  They always say they're doing all this for stabilizing effect.
[00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:15.270]  It's the exact opposite.
[00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.775]  They seize power by creating booms, getting everybody in debt to them with fiat made up
[00:12:21.856 --> 00:12:23.658]  Uh, liquidity and money.
[00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:30.585]  When they implode things, when they know that mathematically, basically no country or nation or major corporation can pay it back.
[00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:32.107]  This is the name of the game.
[00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:32.888]  It's monopoly.
[00:12:32.888 --> 00:12:35.811]  It's fire sale.
[00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:43.779]  And so that's why they've destroyed confidence and they've gotten unlimited power in Europe and the United States illegitimately to have tens of trillions of dollars pumped into their coffers.
[00:12:45.137 --> 00:12:47.239]  And then interest on that debt.
[00:12:47.239 --> 00:12:48.661]  Interest on the money they're given.
[00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:53.385]  We give them the money and then we pay interest on the money we gave them to them.
[00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:56.368]  But now they're just going to issue it wholesale themselves.
[00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:59.031]  And they've been doing this for several years at the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:59.031 --> 00:12:59.612]  It's come out.
[00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:00.212]  Now they admit it.
[00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.474]  We told you last year they were doing it.
[00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:18.487]  It's come out in mainstream news, London Telegraph, Times of London, Associated Press, Reuters, that the IMF and World Bank are already and the Federal Reserve are already issuing a super currency that's monetized only to other financial institutions that are part of their cartel.
[00:13:19.676 --> 00:13:32.508]  And so while the rest of the world is cash poor and they've cut off the cash conduit pipeline to the people and governments, they themselves are using all of the fiat currency they've created to buy everything up.
[00:13:32.508 --> 00:13:38.213]  I mean, this is the most galactic-sized fraud, the most colossal, the most
[00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:46.802]  Just unspeakably gargantuan, out in the open, ridiculously evil thing you can imagine.
[00:13:46.802 --> 00:13:48.864]  So they love people talking about $165 million to AIG.
[00:13:48.864 --> 00:13:50.386]  They just absolutely revel in that.
[00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:59.145]  No discussion of the 9.7 trillion stolen in the last five and a half months in the U.S.
[00:13:59.145 --> 00:13:59.725]  alone.
[00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:02.447]  Tens of trillions more worldwide by the same people.
[00:14:02.447 --> 00:14:05.628]  No discussion of them openly setting up a world bank and a world currency.
[00:14:05.628 --> 00:14:20.716]  I mean, they're putting it in the news and telling you that's the solution and they're doing it, but no real discussion about how these are criminals and this is world government, even as their articles say it is world government run by the banks.
[00:14:20.716 --> 00:14:23.298]  And they're going to bring in neo-feudalism and complete serfdom.
[00:14:24.972 --> 00:14:38.967]  So I'm going to go over that report, well this group of reports here on the show today, but I want to get started with this and it's 11 minutes long, then we'll go into the next segment.
[00:14:38.967 --> 00:14:42.831]  Listeners in England actually used the soundtrack from Endgame.
[00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:43.932]  Glad folks are enjoying that.
[00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:50.566]  They put a little music under it, but it's clips.
[00:14:50.566 --> 00:14:59.150]  And then I saw this two days ago, meant to play it the last two days, and I've had time since then because we're going to use some clips of this in the next Obama film.
[00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:08.093]  I went and watched hours last night, and then I woke up at 5am to go back to sleep and watched hours more of the European Parliamentary debate.
[00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:15.171]  on what's happening and they openly say world government, world taxes, world regulation.
[00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:19.956]  Gordon Brown says you won't be able to go anywhere in the world without the new Bank of the World controlling you.
[00:15:19.956 --> 00:15:22.359]  He calls it a global Europe.
[00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:25.122]  The entire planet will be tied into the European Union.
[00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:33.813]  And for those that love to obsess on Rome running things, I have been looking more into it.
[00:15:33.813 --> 00:15:37.495]  And the European Union was founded in Rome, Treaty of Rome 57.
[00:15:37.495 --> 00:15:41.178]  The Pope does say it's a world government of the European Union.
[00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:43.740]  Tony Blair has converted to Catholicism.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.823]  And this does have a major thread of the Catholic Church at the heart of it.
[00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.304]  And I'm not here bashing Catholics.
[00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:51.525]  I don't bash Jews.
[00:15:51.525 --> 00:15:52.425]  I don't bash Catholics.
[00:15:52.425 --> 00:15:53.886]  I don't bash Protestants.
[00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.467]  I don't like getting in all this infighting.
[00:15:56.708 --> 00:16:02.871]  I don't care if you're a Catholic or a Protestant or a Jew or whatever you are, we should be against a bank of the world ruling us.
[00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:06.812]  And Israel's heavily involved, the US is heavily involved, the Rothschilds are heavily involved.
[00:16:06.812 --> 00:16:14.835]  I mean, at the top seats of power, it's a, you know, every major power sector is involved in this.
[00:16:14.835 --> 00:16:23.479]  But definitely, I've been researching this deeply, and it really does have a central core of the city of Rome.
[00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:25.820]  See, notice how it's a private city of banking.
[00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:34.452]  Just a few square miles within the city of London itself, that is the financial head of the world.
[00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.454]  And, you know, mainstream news admits that.
[00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:49.682]  And it's privately held, and has its own rules, its own laws, and has set the global maritime system of law that we're under, that is tyrannical, that's Napoleonic, that is Roman.
[00:16:49.682 --> 00:16:54.325]  It's really Roman civil law, but modern times they call it Napoleonic law, guilty until proven innocent, and the rest of it.
[00:16:56.164 --> 00:17:02.841]  Administrative law courts and the law of merchants going back to really before Rome to Greece and Babylon and Egypt.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.341]  And Alexandria and Cairo, but I digress.
[00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:15.705]  Then you have the city of Rome that is setting up this global ecclesiastical merger of all the religions, calling for a new world order.
[00:17:15.705 --> 00:17:26.649]  If you're a Christian, it's quite blasphemous to have the last two popes having hundreds of religious leaders, including animist and others, all meeting and saying it's all one God.
[00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:30.651]  So you've got to go ahead and tell it like it is, and that's why a lot of Catholics are very, very upset, I know.
[00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:35.514]  Because this is just amazing to see all of this unfolding.
[00:17:35.514 --> 00:17:41.158]  And then you have the city of D.C., which is the political military head of the world.
[00:17:41.158 --> 00:17:45.301]  And it's a District of Columbia, an incorporated private corporation, and that is a fact.
[00:17:45.301 --> 00:17:52.586]  So you have the city of Rome, the city of London, and the city of D.C., the District of Columbia.
[00:17:52.586 --> 00:18:01.632]  It wasn't incorporated until long after the founding of this nation, and has been slowly, but now we're coming to the end, abolishing all the constitutional institutions and bringing in this tyranny.
[00:18:04.355 --> 00:18:08.916]  So that's just some of the news that we will be covering today.
[00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:13.537]  When we come back, I'm going to start the first part of this 11-minute clip.
[00:18:13.537 --> 00:18:24.920]  And again, I've been watching hours of the parliamentary debates ahead of the open public rollout of a new global government and a global currency.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.560]  It's already been set up.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.201]  But it's kind of like when they build a ship in a shipyard, they've got these big giant curtains.
[00:18:30.201 --> 00:18:31.982]  You've all seen the old black and white newsreels.
[00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:47.172]  They drop the giant curtains and there's a huge ship and then they release the pins that hold it and it slides into the water and it's a big spectacular splash.
[00:18:47.172 --> 00:18:49.773]  They have now dropped the curtain.
[00:18:49.773 --> 00:19:02.415]  They, April 2nd with the G20, are going to then have it slide off the blocks into the channel and then in the coming months after that they are going to bash the bottle of champagne on its stern.
[00:19:03.717 --> 00:19:05.278]  Or on its bow.
[00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:09.041]  And it's going to cruise out of the harbor into the open sea.
[00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:10.502]  And that's world government.
[00:19:10.502 --> 00:19:24.892]  And then they'll just continue with their new financial total world domination, imploding economies, consolidating power, bankrupting everything so they can come in and buy it up, and then turning government loose, and spy forces, and police state, and forced compulsory service being announced everywhere worldwide.
[00:19:25.612 --> 00:19:28.173]  It is just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:19:28.173 --> 00:19:30.414]  I mean, we are in for deep trouble.
[00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:40.239]  Because when they get this global financial power and a world ID that will still be a national ID but globally standardized, they'll track, trace, track everywhere you're going, control you, can't run anywhere.
[00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:46.863]  Then they're going to carry out the one-child policy, the controlled plague releases, and from here on out it becomes Hitlerian.
[00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:48.965]  The dying is going to start.
[00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:55.814]  I mean, it's already starting if you were in Cambodia or Iraq or hundreds of other countries where the globalists are slaughtering people with their proxies.
[00:19:55.814 --> 00:19:58.517]  But we're going to start dying here and in Europe.
[00:19:58.517 --> 00:20:04.845]  So get ready to die.
[00:20:04.845 --> 00:20:06.007]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[00:20:06.383 --> 00:20:11.325]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:17.548]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[00:20:17.548 --> 00:20:20.209]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[00:20:20.209 --> 00:20:23.171]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:26.852]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:26.912]  NOT.

[00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:06.957]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.957 --> 00:21:13.986]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.534 --> 00:21:21.098]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.098 --> 00:21:23.079]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:25.600]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:36.546]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.823]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.823 --> 00:21:40.683]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.683 --> 00:21:47.605]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:55.868 --> 00:21:57.428]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.428 --> 00:22:00.589]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:06.771]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:15.367]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:23.533]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.533 --> 00:22:28.276]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.618 --> 00:22:33.840]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.181]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.181 --> 00:22:39.282]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.282 --> 00:22:43.783]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.783 --> 00:22:48.685]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.685 --> 00:22:51.686]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:56.502 --> 00:23:00.145]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.046]  You worry.
[00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:03.127]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:23:03.127 --> 00:23:05.769]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:07.891]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:23:07.891 --> 00:23:09.492]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:23:09.492 --> 00:23:13.095]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:23:13.095 --> 00:23:18.339]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:22.302]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:23:22.302 --> 00:23:23.603]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:23:23.973 --> 00:23:26.875]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:30.338]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:38.984]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:43.807]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:23:57.162 --> 00:24:03.807]  Little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:24:03.807 --> 00:24:07.770]  I hear the train a-comin'.
[00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.012]  It's rollin' around the bend.
[00:24:10.012 --> 00:24:14.355]  And I ain't seen the sun shine since I don't know when.
[00:24:14.355 --> 00:24:17.157]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.
[00:24:17.157 --> 00:24:19.199]  And time keeps draggin' on.
[00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:28.336]  You see, to go back to the shipyard analogy, they build this giant warmock of deviltry, this new world order system, they build it.
[00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:39.536]  Behind a thin veil, but we knew people that were in there working on it, and the builders of the ship bragged about what they were constructing, they just didn't put it out on the news.
[00:24:39.536 --> 00:24:44.699]  And then now they're ready to launch the thing, they can't hide it anymore, so they're announcing it and trying to put a good spin on it.
[00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:50.402]  Well, we know what comes next, what they plan to do with this new world order system that they are almost done with.
[00:24:51.877 --> 00:24:59.501]  And that is wage unholy war against the people of the planet, against the people of the world.
[00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:13.368]  Now I want to go ahead and get started with this European Parliament debate, and this is members of the European Parliament from England, France, all over the world, and Prime Minister of England Gordon Brown is there.
[00:25:13.368 --> 00:25:14.909]  So listen carefully, here it is.
[00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:19.311]  I will make a statement to the European Parliament on the preparations
[00:25:19.912 --> 00:25:22.654]  For next week's G20 Summit.
[00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:34.842]  As chairman of the G20, Gordon Brown has been offering active international leadership at what is proving to be one of the most difficult times in recent history.
[00:25:34.842 --> 00:25:46.749]  The speech with which he has helped develop the G20 as a new tool of international economic governance is both encouraging and impressive.
[00:25:48.251 --> 00:25:51.613]  There is no old Europe, no new Europe, no East or West Europe.
[00:25:51.613 --> 00:25:55.996]  There is only one Europe, and it is our home Europe.
[00:25:55.996 --> 00:26:07.545]  So I stand here, proud to be British and proud to be European, representing a country that does not see itself as an island adrift from Europe, but as a country at the centre of Europe.
[00:26:07.545 --> 00:26:10.867]  Not in Europe's slipstream, but in Europe's mainstream.
[00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:29.776]  And that is why I'm also proud that by a large majority our British Parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty.
[00:26:29.776 --> 00:26:38.878]  And I believe that we in Europe are uniquely placed to lead the world in meeting the wholly new and momentous challenges of globalisation ahead.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:45.922]  Prime Minister, you received some criticism this afternoon for your comment, British jobs for British workers, but you can brush that aside.
[00:26:45.922 --> 00:26:56.224]  Because from the moment you said it, I don't think anybody seriously thought that you would ever, as a British Prime Minister, put the interests of British workers above that of your European dream.
[00:26:56.224 --> 00:26:58.965]  And my goodness me, you showed that this afternoon.
[00:26:58.965 --> 00:27:03.526]  It's just a pity that apart from UKIP, virtually nobody seems to have bothered to turn up to listen to you.
[00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:06.124]  No, you're very popular here.
[00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:20.497]  You're very popular indeed, because within a few days of the Irish saying no to the Lisbon Treaty, you had ran that treaty through the British Parliament, and you'd done it breaking a specific... You see, I said you were popular.
[00:27:20.497 --> 00:27:28.264]  You did it breaking a specific manifesto pledge that you would give the British people a referendum on the constitutional treaty.
[00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:31.308]  Shame on you, Prime Minister, for doing that.
[00:27:31.308 --> 00:27:34.333]  You have devalued democracy in our country.
[00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:39.300]  You have devalued the trust that voters have got in you as a British Prime Minister.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.443]  But of course, we know the reason why.
[00:27:41.443 --> 00:27:44.066]  The reason why is that we would have voted no.
[00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:50.914]  You said in your speech that none but those on the extremes oppose the European Union.
[00:27:50.914 --> 00:28:05.541]  Well, that may be right amongst professional career politicians, but a clear majority of the British people want us to have friendship and free trade with the European Union, but do not want to be members of this political union.
[00:28:05.541 --> 00:28:13.725]  I want to discuss how we can build from a world which looks today unsustainable, unsafe and unequal, a truly global society
[00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:18.824]  Which is sustainable for all, secure for all, and fair to all.
[00:28:18.824 --> 00:28:25.893]  And let me repeat, I believe that the European Union is uniquely placed to lead in building this future.
[00:28:25.893 --> 00:28:31.080]  Will you now work to bring the United Kingdom into the Euro in the post-recession period?
[00:28:31.693 --> 00:28:41.755]  I'm also confident that perhaps after today you will announce the end of a couple of opt-outs or even, as my friend Graham Watson said, announce the entry of the UK in the Euro.
[00:28:41.755 --> 00:28:50.097]  Some of you will know that for many years I've advanced the case for a global Europe and for the economic reforms to make it happen.
[00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:54.718]  The initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from Europe.
[00:28:54.718 --> 00:29:01.060]  I recall that both President Sarkozy and I went to Camp David to propose to President Bush
[00:29:01.601 --> 00:29:03.102]  A global response.
[00:29:03.102 --> 00:29:11.025]  I have made this case so strongly in recent years precisely because I passionately want Europe to be leading on the world stage.
[00:29:11.025 --> 00:29:16.428]  Prime Minister, what a courageous speech.
[00:29:16.428 --> 00:29:25.832]  I see you've already mastered the essential craft of the European politician, namely the ability to say one thing in this chamber and a very different thing to your home electorate.
[00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:28.089]  Alright.
[00:29:28.089 --> 00:29:29.489]  We'll come back and play the rest of it.
[00:29:29.489 --> 00:29:34.491]  In fact, back it up about 30 seconds where he says a global Europe.
[00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:38.812]  A world government.
[00:29:38.812 --> 00:29:41.133]  World government dominated by the European Union.
[00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:43.334]  That is what all the new order documents state.
[00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:43.954]  And the U.S.
[00:29:43.954 --> 00:29:48.456]  will be nothing but a third world slave group that supplies military forces.
[00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:51.077]  That's it.
[00:29:51.077 --> 00:29:52.477]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.477 --> 00:29:53.978]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.008 --> 00:29:57.677]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:07.983]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:30:07.983 --> 00:30:12.526]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:18.150]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:25.676]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:30:25.676 --> 00:30:30.580]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:36.885]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:30:36.885 --> 00:30:42.689]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:06.484]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.288 --> 00:31:13.169]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.169 --> 00:31:19.671]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:21.631]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.631 --> 00:31:24.092]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.092 --> 00:31:34.974]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:38.941]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.941 --> 00:31:40.803]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.803 --> 00:31:47.730]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:55.999 --> 00:31:57.560]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.742]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.703 --> 00:32:07.548]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[00:32:07.548 --> 00:32:08.489]  It's true.
[00:32:08.489 --> 00:32:14.073]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:14.073 --> 00:32:15.454]  Not if, but when.
[00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:17.965]  Let's do it!
[00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:40.873]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[00:32:40.873 --> 00:32:44.854]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[00:32:44.854 --> 00:32:47.295]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[00:32:47.295 --> 00:32:49.555]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:32:49.555 --> 00:32:52.136]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:52.636]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:52.636 --> 00:32:52.676]  877-327-0365.
[00:33:02.492 --> 00:33:16.256]  We're going to finish up with this montage of clips from the European Parliament calling for world government, which they're now setting up.
[00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:20.177]  Then later... Folks, I told you Glenn Beck's a snake.
[00:33:20.177 --> 00:33:23.458]  He called for Rob Hall's supporters to have the army used on him to be arrested last year.
[00:33:23.458 --> 00:33:26.099]  He's not a nice guy, is he?
[00:33:29.582 --> 00:33:30.582]  No.
[00:33:30.582 --> 00:33:37.484]  Now he had Poplar Mechanics on last night and April 6th they're having a big report basically debunking it.
[00:33:37.484 --> 00:33:43.105]  It doesn't matter if I have thousands of government documents, hundreds of mainstream news articles, congressional testimony.
[00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:45.945]  It's in the Houston Chronicle Associated Press.
[00:33:45.945 --> 00:33:49.966]  They're going to have Poplar Mechanics say they don't exist.
[00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:52.867]  Probably put a book out, a magazine cover and say I'm a big liar.
[00:33:54.444 --> 00:33:56.765]  They'll probably say the MIAC report doesn't exist either.
[00:33:56.765 --> 00:34:04.969]  Of course, the state police have now apologized and stopped issuing it, and the lieutenant governor's called for the head of the state police to step down over it.
[00:34:04.969 --> 00:34:06.189]  That's in the St.
[00:34:06.189 --> 00:34:11.532]  Louis Post-Dispatch, Kansas City Star, Associated Press, but it doesn't exist!
[00:34:11.532 --> 00:34:14.953]  The MIAC report doesn't exist either.
[00:34:14.953 --> 00:34:16.914]  Oh boy, none of it exists.
[00:34:16.914 --> 00:34:20.596]  All these hundreds of news articles calling for world government, of and by the banks, doesn't exist either.
[00:34:22.648 --> 00:34:25.910]  Beck for weeks has been saying, I'll tell you the truth about the FEMA camps.
[00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.971]  We're investigating.
[00:34:27.971 --> 00:34:30.933]  We're the place to find out if it's true.
[00:34:30.933 --> 00:34:34.456]  And then Ron Paul comes on and he says, are you worried about these camps?
[00:34:34.456 --> 00:34:40.960]  He said, well, you know, there's a bill to do it, but, you know, I don't think right now it's a problem, but we can't trust the government.
[00:34:42.461 --> 00:34:44.442]  And so then both sides misrepresented that.
[00:34:44.442 --> 00:34:51.626]  People that are mad at Ron Paul for not being more hard core said, I got emails about it, saw stories written, Hey, Ron Paul said there's no camps.
[00:34:51.626 --> 00:34:57.009]  No, Ron Paul said, well, there's a bill to do it, but he doesn't see any right now.
[00:34:57.009 --> 00:35:03.153]  And he does take too conservative of a position, because I know Ron Paul is extremely well read.
[00:35:03.153 --> 00:35:09.537]  It's kind of like the John Birch Society wrote articles saying black helicopters and urban warfare didn't exist.
[00:35:10.834 --> 00:35:25.486]  A couple years before they reversed themselves on the cover about militarization of police, and I actually saw one of their riders in an urban warfare takeover drill in Oakland, and he was there and he said, oh Alex Jones, and I said yeah, oh you're here now witnessing the black helicopters.
[00:35:25.486 --> 00:35:32.933]  And I even sent them an Associated Press article where they tried to bribe the police chief and others, not just my video interviewing him that broke it.
[00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:55.313]  They made it into the San Antonio Express News and AP, but I mailed them that, because I saw one of their writers there, who'd written a piece saying it didn't exist, but he lived in California, so I saw the writer there at the Oakland Takeover, and I said, okay, give me your card, I'm going to mail you the AP.
[00:35:55.313 --> 00:35:56.114]  And you know what?
[00:35:56.114 --> 00:36:01.538]  They published the AP article in their magazine and said, okay, it's true.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.605]  So, it's like I had McManus in here yesterday, the president of the John Birch Society, which I think does good work.
[00:36:08.605 --> 00:36:10.687]  They're good people.
[00:36:10.687 --> 00:36:16.352]  And I didn't throw any, you know, hardball questions at him, because I just wanted to, you know, pick his brain and, you know, get to know him.
[00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:25.100]  And they did do a lot of the groundwork on exposing this whole thing, and a lot of us wouldn't even be here today knowing about this if it wasn't for them.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.402]  A lot of their material was seminal in waking me up.
[00:36:28.707 --> 00:36:36.289]  But, a good old Bobby Vaughn, my dad's friend, died of a brain tumor two years ago, but grew up with him hanging out.
[00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:37.310]  He was a big JBS-er.
[00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.931]  He was always bringing their books over, and none dare call a conspiracy, and giving them to my dad.
[00:36:40.931 --> 00:36:47.113]  And then, as soon as I could read, I was pulling it off the bookshelf of just thousands of books in our house, my parents' house.
[00:36:47.113 --> 00:36:49.414]  Every room was full of bookshelves.
[00:36:49.414 --> 00:36:51.474]  Storage things full of books, you know.
[00:36:51.474 --> 00:36:53.315]  It was that one book I pulled off the shelf.
[00:36:55.856 --> 00:37:05.243]  So we gotta thank them, but at the same time, he's in here and I said, yeah, their goal is 7 million people in this Youth Service Corps and these other compulsory volunteer things.
[00:37:05.243 --> 00:37:11.107]  And he said, no Alex, it's 250,000 and then 500,000 is what they want.
[00:37:11.107 --> 00:37:17.412]  And I said, well that's in one of the bills to start, but here's the New York Times with the Senator saying this is their goal.
[00:37:17.412 --> 00:37:18.433]  And he went, oh, okay.
[00:37:18.433 --> 00:37:19.734]  And he left with the New York Times.
[00:37:22.498 --> 00:37:29.640]  So a lot of it is, we've just got to continue to educate Ron Paul, we've got to continue to educate the JBS, we've got to continue to educate the Liberals, the Conservatives, every group.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.181]  Because all the time, listeners call me and go, did you know about this?
[00:37:34.181 --> 00:37:35.201]  Why aren't you reporting on this?
[00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:36.222]  And I go, thank you!
[00:37:36.222 --> 00:37:41.703]  No, I missed it, or I didn't see it, or I saw it and didn't have time to read it and forgot about it.
[00:37:41.703 --> 00:37:43.864]  Because we're just overwhelmed here.
[00:37:43.864 --> 00:37:51.346]  That's your power out there, with films and books and news articles and email lists, is to just continue to educate everybody.
[00:37:51.846 --> 00:38:02.954]  You know, now that they're writing hundreds of articles every week admitting world government's real and the bank of the world and the currency and all the global currency, a lot of people are saying, okay, well now it's all admitted and kind of standing down.
[00:38:02.954 --> 00:38:03.915]  Some people are.
[00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:06.837]  The awakening's bigger than ever, but some people are saying we've done our job.
[00:38:06.837 --> 00:38:08.298]  No!
[00:38:08.298 --> 00:38:10.780]  In fact, I have to call Paul Watson and Kurt all the time.
[00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:16.197]  And go, look, there's an article here about how they want to make us take implantable microchips.
[00:38:16.197 --> 00:38:17.819]  And they're like, yeah, everybody knows that.
[00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:22.564]  We've written hundreds of articles on it and posted probably thousands over the years, Alex.
[00:38:22.564 --> 00:38:24.326]  Old news.
[00:38:24.326 --> 00:38:27.650]  It's not old news to people that didn't know about it and who were laughing at us.
[00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.532]  Now we can say, look, it's openly admitted.
[00:38:30.572 --> 00:38:33.835]  I call Paul up, one of our best writers, and I say, Paul, you do such great research.
[00:38:33.835 --> 00:38:35.777]  Will you put a big master article together?
[00:38:35.777 --> 00:38:37.479]  I've been asking for two weeks.
[00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:40.962]  Like you did on the compulsory service the other day.
[00:38:40.962 --> 00:38:41.903]  Excellent story.
[00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:44.105]  Much better writer than I could do.
[00:38:44.105 --> 00:38:49.590]  And I said, we need one about how they're openly setting up world government, a bank of the world, and tie it all together with everything.
[00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.452]  And he said, but Alex, it's all over the news now.
[00:38:52.386 --> 00:38:54.868]  Well, and we've been covering this for years.
[00:38:54.868 --> 00:39:00.473]  And I said, I know, but we have to now bring in the latest information and point out we were right again.
[00:39:00.473 --> 00:39:17.407]  I mean, it doesn't matter if it's in, no exaggeration, hundreds and hundreds of news articles, thousands of government documents, army.mil, civilian inmate labor camp program, all of this openly admitted that they're building camps everywhere,
[00:39:18.424 --> 00:39:35.172]  They're now forcing people in Hawaii and in California and other states to leave their little tent cities and to go into sports domes and fairgrounds behind barbed wire and the police search their cars outside and they search their IDs and CPSs in there.
[00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:35.912]  That's all admitted.
[00:39:35.912 --> 00:39:38.493]  I mean, being forced because you're homeless into a camp?
[00:39:38.493 --> 00:39:44.636]  That's how this starts in Cambodia and Russia and China and Germany.
[00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:46.337]  They first bring in economic
[00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:57.481]  Degradation, and then they put you into the camps, and they set the precedent, and then, oh, there's crime in the camps, we gotta build a holding facility, and you're off to the races, and that's what's being openly announced.
[00:39:57.481 --> 00:40:00.162]  I mean, they have a bill which just mirrors what they've already built.
[00:40:00.162 --> 00:40:04.404]  Kind of like they were spying on us for decades without warrants with the National Security Agency.
[00:40:06.451 --> 00:40:15.040]  An echelon keyword software and now they just admit it and then when it came out that every case of it was a felony, they then retroactively pass a law saying they can do it.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.825]  Well, just like these FEMA camps are illegal, they're now trying to pass a law.
[00:40:19.825 --> 00:40:29.435]  But the key is the bill tells you how the camps are already set up and how the police are at them and the local clergy and the InfraGard and the clergy response team and medical centers and cots and
[00:40:33.982 --> 00:40:46.613]  In 2000, or 1999, it's in my film Police Day to the Takeover, I got calls from workmen taking old 747 hangars at the Robert Mueller Municipal Airport they just closed and moved to Bergstrom.
[00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:51.717]  And it's a huge complex in the middle of Austin, in Central East Austin.
[00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:59.504]  And part of it they turned into a movie studio, parts of it turned into storage, it was all these hangars and facilities and big airport building, terminals and everything.
[00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:12.761]  And I go out there, I interviewed security guards, and he goes, yeah, they're putting in bolts and chains and porta-potties and cots and barbed wire fences inside, and I go put that on local TV, and people say, oh, you're a liar, it doesn't exist.
[00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:23.350]  Then local Fox News, six months later, goes in, they show the bolts and chains, they show the cots, they show the porta-potties, the fences inside with barbed wire on top.
[00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.290]  I put that in the film.
[00:41:25.407 --> 00:41:27.328]  And people say it isn't real and doesn't exist.
[00:41:27.328 --> 00:41:30.670]  And they go, oh, that's a movie studio out there!
[00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.530]  Well, yeah, part of it is.
[00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.512]  Kind of like FEMA's taking over part of Highland Mall.
[00:41:34.512 --> 00:41:36.113]  People go, I drove by Highland Mall!
[00:41:36.113 --> 00:41:37.894]  There's still a Sears there!
[00:41:37.894 --> 00:41:44.818]  Yes, we said part of Highland Mall, and we've posted two videos of it, and they admit it, and it was in the local paper.
[00:41:44.818 --> 00:41:48.340]  I said part of Highland Mall is a FEMA induction center.
[00:41:52.196 --> 00:42:01.219]  I mean, another example of this is we post mainstream news where they're putting out their propaganda so people can comment on and analyze it.
[00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:06.801]  And I talk about this not because we get criticized, but because it's good to analyze people's mindsets of denial.
[00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:14.403]  We posted this article out of the Associated Press, Vaccine Refusal Spars Outbreak Fears.
[00:42:14.403 --> 00:42:20.425]  It talks about people all over the world, from Europe to Latin America to Asia to, you name it, not taking vaccines en masse.
[00:42:21.752 --> 00:42:27.676]  You know, in Ukraine alone, nine million refused vaccines, just for one injection.
[00:42:27.676 --> 00:42:30.358]  What, MMR, triple jab.
[00:42:30.358 --> 00:42:33.861]  Three things in one shot.
[00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:43.407]  And we posted that, you know, to show, well, just the first paragraph and a link to it, so people can read the whole article, and people are commenting, oh, now you're for vaccines, Alex!
[00:42:43.407 --> 00:42:44.128]  What is this?
[00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.830]  See, they lack critical thinking.
[00:42:48.407 --> 00:42:53.030]  We're posting an article about how people are refusing to take vaccines.
[00:42:53.030 --> 00:43:01.556]  Obviously, it's government propaganda saying you sure need to take it or there's going to be an outbreak where if you've supposedly taken the shot, you can't get it.
[00:43:01.556 --> 00:43:10.182]  And we post it there so I can then come on air and you can read it with me as I read it on air and so I can debunk it.
[00:43:10.182 --> 00:43:16.246]  But no, in the mad rush to find some way to try to discredit me, they say, oh no, he's now saying vaccines are good.
[00:43:16.246 --> 00:43:17.027]  That's not what I'm saying.
[00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:25.153]  I mean, it's just bizarre that this is how people's mindset works.
[00:43:25.153 --> 00:43:31.277]  It's just that they're unable to think in any complex way, and it's bizarre.
[00:43:31.277 --> 00:43:34.699]  I'll post an article about how governments all over the world are going to turn the lights off
[00:43:35.788 --> 00:43:46.717]  Starting one night a year and then one night a month and then one night a week, training you that industry's bad, that power's bad, training you to have less, to live as a feudal serf under their control.
[00:43:46.717 --> 00:43:50.079]  It doesn't mean I'm for turning all the lights out.
[00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:56.605]  I'm showing you, you know, I post articles where they say we need a global government, a global bank to issue the currency and control all the governments of the world.
[00:43:57.265 --> 00:44:01.829]  And in the entire magazine article I linked to called the New World Order that said that, people did the same thing.
[00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:05.051]  Look at him putting out New World Order propaganda calling for a New World Order.
[00:44:05.051 --> 00:44:11.316]  No, we're posting the mainstream media admitting all of this so people can see what's going on.
[00:44:11.316 --> 00:44:14.598]  It's bizarre.
[00:44:14.598 --> 00:44:24.666]  The mental gymnastics people go through... I got sent an email by some fake Christian website saying, pretty big saying,
[00:44:26.187 --> 00:44:28.728]  Alex Jones is calling for armed revolt.
[00:44:28.728 --> 00:44:29.709]  That is not in the Bible.
[00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:33.850]  We are to submit to the beast system, basically.
[00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:39.193]  And Romans 13, and his Obama deception is bad.
[00:44:39.193 --> 00:44:42.254]  You shouldn't watch it.
[00:44:42.254 --> 00:44:49.097]  And Alex once spoke at a Unitarian church, which has ties to Socialists, so he is a Communist!
[00:44:51.843 --> 00:45:18.335]  Like if I speak at Sheraton Hotel in L.A., I don't work for Sheraton, or if I use a Neumann microphone, I don't work for the Neumann Microphone Company, or if I have a Sony or Panasonic camera, or a Atomix atomic clock, or a... I mean, it's just this obsession with Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones!
[00:45:18.335 --> 00:45:19.876]  He did this, he did that, he...
[00:45:23.447 --> 00:45:25.109]  It's just crazy.
[00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:32.316]  And so one of our biggest problems is you have the mainstream media spinning, lying, obfuscating, pushing propaganda, and we're trying to analyze that.
[00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:41.286]  Then you have the general public wrecked by the system, wrecked by the establishment, a large portion of it, who are even awake to the New World Order, but they won't spend any of their time actually fighting the globalists.
[00:45:41.826 --> 00:46:00.479]  They spend all their time critiquing each other and ninnying and bitching and witch hunts, when all I'm trying to do is say, here's world government with world ID card, total control, they're putting cancer viruses in your vaccine, sodium fluoride in your water, here's all the studies that have hurt you and harmed you, what are you going to do about it?
[00:46:00.479 --> 00:46:04.982]  And that's what the globalists are afraid of, is us just simply putting the information out.
[00:46:06.926 --> 00:46:12.307]  And I told you our biggest problem is the phony churches telling their people to lay down to corrupt government.
[00:46:12.307 --> 00:46:13.467]  It is totally unbiblical.
[00:46:13.467 --> 00:46:16.048]  It is just wicked.
[00:46:16.048 --> 00:46:18.529]  Historically it's a fraud and it's just disgusting.
[00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:24.070]  Let's finish up with the European Union meetings openly calling for a global Europe ruling the planet.
[00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:25.610]  Here it is.
[00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:33.512]  Some of you will know that for many years I've advanced the case for a global Europe and for the economic reforms to make it happen.
[00:46:34.033 --> 00:46:38.575]  Initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from Europe.
[00:46:38.575 --> 00:46:46.598]  I would recall that both President Sarkozy and I went to Camp David to propose to President Bush a global response.
[00:46:46.598 --> 00:46:54.882]  But I have made this case so strongly in recent years precisely because I passionately want Europe to be leading on the world stage.
[00:46:54.882 --> 00:46:57.923]  Prime Minister, what a courageous speech.
[00:47:00.256 --> 00:47:10.303]  I see you've already mastered the essential craft of the European politician, namely the ability to say one thing in this chamber and a very different thing to your home electorate.
[00:47:10.303 --> 00:47:13.265]  You've spoken here about free trade and are meant to that.
[00:47:13.265 --> 00:47:27.235]  Who would have guessed, listening to you just now, that you were the author of the phrase British jobs for British workers, and that you have subsidised where you have not nationalised outright swathes of our economy, including the car industry and many of the banks.
[00:47:27.235 --> 00:47:28.736]  Starting at our debate today,
[00:47:29.437 --> 00:47:39.917]  As we prepare for the London Summit next week, I propose that we as Europe take a central role in replacing what was once called the old Washington consensus.
[00:47:40.592 --> 00:47:44.334]  With a new and principled economic consensus for our times.
[00:47:44.334 --> 00:47:51.197]  You cannot, you cannot continue against public opinion to build this European Union.
[00:47:51.197 --> 00:47:58.141]  If you do it against the will of the people, you are storing up enormous social and political problems for the future.
[00:47:58.141 --> 00:48:02.183]  Please, please let the peoples of Europe decide their destiny.
[00:48:02.183 --> 00:48:06.565]  Don't have it done in parliaments like this and parliaments like Westminster.
[00:48:06.565 --> 00:48:07.806]  It won't work.
[00:48:07.806 --> 00:48:10.227]  I propose that Europe takes the lead
[00:48:10.848 --> 00:48:13.009]  We need a European Financial Services Authority.
[00:48:36.653 --> 00:48:41.318]  We need also to reject all forms of economic nationalism and protectionism.
[00:48:55.757 --> 00:49:08.270]  In this unique experience of setting supranational, transnational rules, we show that the European Union is better prepared than anyone, not to impose, but to propose the rules for this globalization.
[00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:18.660]  Our regulations should apply to every bank, everywhere, at every time, with no opt-out for a shadow banking system, no hiding place in any part of the world for tax avoiders,
[00:49:19.158 --> 00:49:21.779]  You are refusing to pay the fair share.
[00:49:21.779 --> 00:49:27.201]  But as far as the economy is concerned, you've told us that somehow you're the economic guru.
[00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:29.422]  You're the man that can save the world.
[00:49:29.422 --> 00:49:38.906]  Well, I remember very well your first big act as Chancellor when you sold 400 metric tons of gold on the world's exchanges at $275 an ounce.
[00:49:42.888 --> 00:49:47.154]  At today's valuation, that would be $10 billion higher.
[00:49:47.154 --> 00:49:50.499]  But it isn't just the fact you got it wrong, because we can all get it wrong.
[00:49:50.499 --> 00:49:56.347]  It was the fact that you announced in advance how much you were going to sell, and on what day you were going to sell it.
[00:49:56.347 --> 00:49:57.929]  It was an error so basic...
[00:49:58.209 --> 00:50:04.733]  That the average A-level economic student, even in these educationally devalued times, wouldn't have done.
[00:50:04.733 --> 00:50:08.195]  To add to that, you've destroyed our private pension system.
[00:50:08.195 --> 00:50:17.241]  You took away from the Bank of England its ability to regulate the banks and gave it to the tick-box bureaucrats of the FSA in Canary Wharf.
[00:50:17.241 --> 00:50:19.302]  And we haven't heard an apology.
[00:50:19.302 --> 00:50:22.705]  Your government has apologised for the Amritsar massacre.
[00:50:22.705 --> 00:50:24.686]  You've apologised for slavery.
[00:50:24.686 --> 00:50:26.507]  You've apologised for virtually everything!
[00:50:26.967 --> 00:50:34.113]  Will you please apologise for what you did as British Chancellor and then perhaps we might just listen to you.
[00:50:34.113 --> 00:50:36.555]  Thank you.
[00:50:36.555 --> 00:50:54.650]  A new reformed International Monetary Fund in which we welcome greater representation from the emerging economies and which must have at least 500 billions of resources, twice what it has today, must be empowered to help countries that are facing a flight of capital.
[00:50:55.564 --> 00:50:57.605]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:57.605 --> 00:51:00.846]  The birth of world government run by private banks.
[00:51:00.846 --> 00:51:09.070]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:13.632]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:51:13.632 --> 00:51:18.314]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:51:18.314 --> 00:51:19.715]  It's a documented fact.
[00:51:19.755 --> 00:51:20.155]  We're good to go!
[00:51:38.656 --> 00:51:43.740]  Once a day, FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.

[00:51:54.488 --> 00:51:58.251]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.111 --> 00:52:14.696]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.696 --> 00:52:21.221]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:23.242]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.242 --> 00:52:25.764]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.764 --> 00:52:36.712]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.333 --> 00:52:38.994]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.994 --> 00:52:40.854]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.854 --> 00:52:47.757]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.757 --> 00:52:56.020]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.600]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.801]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.652 --> 00:53:04.174]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:53:04.174 --> 00:53:06.096]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:53:06.096 --> 00:53:11.659]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:53:11.659 --> 00:53:19.684]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:53:50.869 --> 00:53:54.690]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:57.270]  That's 989-637-4179.
[00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:01.051]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:08.093]  And so I want an international monetary fund that does not just react to crises, but prevents crises.
[00:54:08.093 --> 00:54:11.234]  And I want a World Bank that has the resources to prevent poverty,
[00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:24.663]  Perhaps you would have more moral authority in this house if your actions matched your words.
[00:54:24.663 --> 00:54:35.965]  Perhaps you would have more legitimacy in the councils of the world if the United Kingdom were not going into this recession in the worst condition of any G20 country.
[00:54:35.965 --> 00:54:40.306]  The truth, Prime Minister, is that you have run out of our money.
[00:54:41.152 --> 00:54:45.053]  The country as a whole is now in negative equity.
[00:54:45.053 --> 00:54:48.714]  Every British child is born owing around £20,000.
[00:54:48.714 --> 00:54:56.055]  Servicing the interest on that debt is going to cost more than educating the child.
[00:54:56.055 --> 00:55:02.417]  And today I want to emphasise also that Europe and America can work more closely together.
[00:55:02.417 --> 00:55:07.038]  I talked to President Obama yesterday about what I want to talk to you about today.
[00:55:07.881 --> 00:55:12.244]  About a new era of heightened cooperation between Europe and America.
[00:55:12.244 --> 00:55:20.308]  Now, never in recent years have we had an American leadership so keen to cooperate at all levels with Europe.
[00:55:20.308 --> 00:55:22.370]  The opinion is moving.
[00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:30.594]  We'll say it loud and clear in London, so that we can be working together with our partners, namely our American friends.
[00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:32.355]  We want the others to move along with us.
[00:55:32.355 --> 00:55:34.897]  We need global rules to the global economy.
[00:55:35.618 --> 00:55:52.890]  So starting with the EU-US summit a few days from now, when President Obama comes to Prague, we can transform that summit from just an annual meeting into an unstoppable progressive partnership to secure the global change that the world now needs.
[00:55:52.890 --> 00:56:03.677]  Prime Minister, you cannot carry on forever squeezing the productive bit of the economy in order to fund an unprecedented engorgement of the unproductive bit.
[00:56:04.364 --> 00:56:09.765]  You cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt.
[00:56:09.765 --> 00:56:21.727]  And when you repeat, in that wooden and perfunctory way, that our situation is better than others, that we're well-placed to weather the storm, I have to tell you, you sound like a Brezhnev-era apparatchik giving the party line.
[00:56:21.727 --> 00:56:26.288]  You know, and we know, and you know that we know that it's nonsense!
[00:56:26.288 --> 00:56:30.309]  Everyone knows that Britain is worse off than any other country as we go into these hard times.
[00:56:39.571 --> 00:56:49.495]  And if you talk about what you just heard, Rush Limbaugh, and the rest of them come out and say you're a kook.
[00:56:49.495 --> 00:56:54.857]  All we do is watch the European Parliament.
[00:56:54.857 --> 00:56:59.219]  All we do is watch C-SPAN read the bills.
[00:56:59.219 --> 00:57:04.521]  All we do is read the Army War College admitting they're preparing to wage war against the American people.
[00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:05.782]  And the enemy tells us we lie.
[00:57:06.767 --> 00:57:13.749]  No, you lie.
[00:57:13.749 --> 00:57:22.491]  So... They're digging the grave for our Republic.
[00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:26.992]  England has refused to join the European Union.
[00:57:26.992 --> 00:57:33.454]  And so Gordon Brown is forcing them, despite the fact that in every poll, more than 90% of Brits don't want it.
[00:57:34.622 --> 00:57:40.464]  And you heard the British member of the European Parliament standing up to Brown.
[00:57:42.093 --> 00:57:44.834]  And explaining to him that there will be rebellion in England.
[00:57:44.834 --> 00:57:52.796]  But that's why they have Common Purpose and all these other government-controlled groups in control of every city and town, is because they're there to suppress the people standing up and saying no.
[00:57:52.796 --> 00:57:56.777]  And that's why when we go out and protest the private Fed, the European-U.S.
[00:57:56.777 --> 00:58:00.378]  branch of what's happening, the Army's spying on us, and they admit it.
[00:58:00.378 --> 00:58:01.899]  Because they work for the criminals.
[00:58:01.899 --> 00:58:03.719]  Our government has been seized.
[00:58:03.719 --> 00:58:05.780]  Now, I have the YouTube clip.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.361]  It's going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next few minutes.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.781]  This is a huge announcement.
[00:58:13.781 --> 00:58:17.321]  This is so important.
[00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:23.543]  Glenn Beck has been talking a little bit about the New World Order in an attempt to get people's confidence, only to betray it.
[00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:25.843]  He does this back and forth.
[00:58:25.843 --> 00:58:36.386]  He has come out saying, with popular mechanics, none of the camps exist, though it's in the Houston Chronicle, and that he's going to debunk it.
[00:58:36.386 --> 00:58:38.306]  I told you folks, he was suckering you.
[00:58:42.268 --> 00:58:45.751]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:50.754]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.754 --> 00:58:51.374]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.374 --> 00:58:52.435]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.435 --> 00:58:57.178]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.178 --> 00:59:00.141]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.141 --> 00:59:03.183]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.183 --> 00:59:07.906]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.066 --> 00:59:08.346]  We're good.
[00:59:27.904 --> 00:59:34.167]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:41.711]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:55.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.972 --> 01:00:05.179]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.179 --> 01:00:06.500]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.261]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.023]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.604]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.604 --> 01:00:13.165]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.165 --> 01:00:17.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:21.432]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.483 --> 01:00:30.488]  We have turned the power of the people of the United States and the world loose.
[01:00:30.488 --> 01:00:34.672]  Those of us in the anti-New World Order, anti-globalization move.
[01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:37.916]  We're just fighting authoritarian's tyranny.
[01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:41.861]  But we need to combine our forces on a more regular basis.
[01:00:43.666 --> 01:01:00.501]  to cause larger and larger viral spreads of our information through the internet out into the third dimension plane we all live in physically on the streets at city council with copies of DVDs with materials and information
[01:01:01.682 --> 01:01:05.866]  Exponentially growing our numbers, and that's what's happening right now.
[01:01:05.866 --> 01:01:07.748]  And that's why the globalists are pulling out all the stops.
[01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:10.931]  Now, Bob Chapman, I'm about to go to Bob Chapman.
[01:01:10.931 --> 01:01:17.998]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, I'm going to play, while Bob's on with us, a YouTube clip.
[01:01:17.998 --> 01:01:23.303]  And, you know, I called this months ago, Glenn Beck on his radio show, then on his TV show in the last month.
[01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:27.008]  I've never really come out against Glenn Beck.
[01:01:27.008 --> 01:01:28.888]  I said the guy's a neocon.
[01:01:28.888 --> 01:01:32.250]  He says put Ron Paul supporters in FEMA camps.
[01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:36.351]  I'd criticize him for that, but I'd say he's just a discredited minion.
[01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:38.432]  He's not that big of a danger to the people.
[01:01:38.432 --> 01:01:43.974]  Then in the last six months he started saying there's a global government being set up, but then he would always sandwich that in.
[01:01:46.331 --> 01:01:48.673]  With Al Qaeda and they're gonna get us.
[01:01:48.673 --> 01:01:52.115]  It was psychological manipulation.
[01:01:52.115 --> 01:01:55.998]  And then for the last month or so he's been saying, I'm gonna expose the FEMA camp, whether they're real or not.
[01:01:55.998 --> 01:01:58.079]  In-depth investigation.
[01:01:58.079 --> 01:02:00.921]  And he promised every night to do it and have folks tune in and he wouldn't do it.
[01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:03.423]  Then he'd kind of laugh at it and discredit it.
[01:02:03.423 --> 01:02:07.285]  Well now he's had the head of Popular Mechanics
[01:02:08.852 --> 01:02:20.140]  On, uh, remember, Hearst Publishing are the folks that were run by William Randolph Hearst, who in the Spanish-American War said, you supply the pitchers, I'll supply the war, making up that Spain was attacking people in, uh, in Cuba.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.883]  And they're the folks with the fake red scare.
[01:02:24.883 --> 01:02:27.406]  They're the folks that are always calling for a police state.
[01:02:27.406 --> 01:02:28.807]  He was a big robber baron.
[01:02:28.807 --> 01:02:32.311]  And in the Encyclopedia Britannica, under yellow journalism, it says Hurst Publishing.
[01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:36.896]  So, I mean, you cannot have a more discredited, more nasty group of individuals.
[01:02:36.896 --> 01:02:40.059]  And they're the ones that went after 9-11 Truth, which just totally made up crap.
[01:02:42.122 --> 01:02:43.582]  They are now going to quote, debunk.
[01:02:43.582 --> 01:02:52.164]  Now I said a few weeks ago, I did like an hour on the FEMA Camps with all the documents, video clips, but I said I was going to do several hours on it, a master debunking.
[01:02:52.164 --> 01:02:57.245]  And then I've been busy launching the Obama Deception and other things, but I am going to do the research.
[01:02:57.245 --> 01:02:57.965]  I've done the research.
[01:02:57.965 --> 01:03:00.405]  I'm going to dig all the documents back out.
[01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:01.865]  There's just so many.
[01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:06.686]  The Congressional Testimony, and the Miami Herald, and Houston Chronicle, I mean hundreds.
[01:03:06.686 --> 01:03:10.267]  Army.mil, Regulation 210-35, Civilian Domain Labor Camp Program.
[01:03:10.267 --> 01:03:11.347]  I have it here in front of me.
[01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:16.024]  Glenn Beck knows full well about all the FEMA camps.
[01:03:16.024 --> 01:03:21.185]  You know, three weeks ago I did that hour-long special, it's gone viral on the web.
[01:03:21.185 --> 01:03:43.193]  I want you to make, I'll do it early next week, that'll give us a few days ahead of their debunking on April 6th, to make it go mega-viral, and if we do this, millions of views can be attained, so that ahead of time they're debunked, just like somebody leaked to us the Popular Mechanics magazine before it was actually out, and we debunked it before it launched, and that was critical to defeating them, and we did defeat them.
[01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:49.567]  Bob Chapman, we talked about this three weeks ago when you were on, and boy now Beck has really shown himself.
[01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:53.328]  He says they don't exist, there's no FEMA camps.
[01:03:53.328 --> 01:03:57.790]  Well, some of us have blinders on, conveniently so.
[01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:07.853]  And that's what's to be expected from the people who are on the air, misleading people.
[01:04:07.853 --> 01:04:13.535]  You know, they give you 95% truth and then 5% of the New World Orders agenda.
[01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:19.423]  And it's been many, many of them through the years, and he's one of them.
[01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:25.049]  But I'd say with him it's more like 70% truth and 30% New World Order lies.
[01:04:25.049 --> 01:04:29.453]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:34.699]  I mean, Lou Dobbs really is a paradox because overall he's positive and really helps things.
[01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:40.835]  But I guess that's why the ADL and Southern Primary Law Center is attacking him.
[01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:41.335]  Stay there.
[01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:43.116]  We're going to come right back to you after this quick break.
[01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:45.017]  Break down what's happening on the financial end.
[01:04:45.017 --> 01:04:47.178]  Then I want to play this back clip for everybody.
[01:04:47.178 --> 01:04:48.759]  Folks, tell your friends and family to tune in.
[01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.079]  I'm going to play this clip.
[01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:52.340]  I'm going to do a little bit of debunking on him.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.221]  Some basic facts.
[01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:56.362]  And then we'll continue.
[01:04:56.362 --> 01:04:58.143]  But I want to get Bob Chapman's take on this as well.
[01:04:58.143 --> 01:04:58.523]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:02.070]  Attention, gardeners!
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:04.671]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:09.195]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:05:09.195 --> 01:05:17.400]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.222]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:05:20.506 --> 01:05:28.149]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:05:28.149 --> 01:05:33.971]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:39.793]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:05:39.793 --> 01:05:43.034]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:05:43.334 --> 01:05:46.937]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:05:46.937 --> 01:05:52.001]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:05:52.001 --> 01:05:54.923]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:05:54.923 --> 01:05:55.223]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:55.223 --> 01:05:58.085]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.145 --> 01:06:14.708]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.708 --> 01:06:21.291]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:23.272]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.272 --> 01:06:25.773]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:36.717]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:39.011]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.011 --> 01:06:40.872]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:47.795]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:56.039]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.039 --> 01:06:57.620]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.821]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:11.456]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:07:11.456 --> 01:07:12.878]  Garden in a can!
[01:07:12.878 --> 01:07:17.022]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:07:17.022 --> 01:07:19.044]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[01:07:19.044 --> 01:07:21.327]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:31.470]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:32.891]  Garden in a can.
[01:07:32.891 --> 01:07:34.091]  It's that simple.
[01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:34.792]  Fresh.
[01:07:34.792 --> 01:07:35.672]  Healthy.
[01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:36.492]  Easy.
[01:07:36.492 --> 01:07:40.814]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:07:40.814 --> 01:07:41.714]  Ready when you are.
[01:07:42.398 --> 01:07:46.460]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.962]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.
[01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:52.083]  That's GardenInACan.com.
[01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:52.583]  Or call 866-598-7396.
[01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:52.643]  866-598-7396.
[01:07:52.643 --> 01:07:54.104]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:55.084]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:22.186]  By the way, I'm just looking from out of the studio into the control room at Will, one of our sales guys, wearing what I think is the most handsome new shirt we've got.
[01:08:22.186 --> 01:08:27.849]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 that I have popularized.
[01:08:27.849 --> 01:08:38.355]  They have a whole new line of t-shirts that will strike up conversations at InfoWars.com on the online video book store or gear store.
[01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:42.765]  And that's how you meet like-minded people and spread the word.
[01:08:42.765 --> 01:08:58.034]  Bob Chapman, I want to get into the economy, and coming up at the bottom of the hour, I am going to launch an operation that I thought about doing last night when I learned of the Glenn Beck newest betrayal.
[01:08:58.034 --> 01:08:59.815]  I want listeners.
[01:08:59.815 --> 01:09:04.818]  Well, I'll tell folks about that at the bottom of the hour, and we'll get into some other important issues.
[01:09:04.818 --> 01:09:06.959]  Oh, there are no FEMA camps, just all over the news.
[01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:08.080]  But getting into the economy,
[01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:28.863]  I know for us it's old news, and so we have that weak spot or that blind spot, in my opinion, at least I do, but because now it's in literally hundreds of papers a day saying the solution is a world government, world bank that sets the taxes, and it was in the BBC two days ago again, a carbon tax starting at $750 billion a year in Europe and the US alone,
[01:09:31.605 --> 01:09:38.072]  And they're now announcing in Canada, they've passed in several other states, the flatulence tax on farmyard animals.
[01:09:38.072 --> 01:09:39.393]  They passed it in New Zealand.
[01:09:39.393 --> 01:09:48.362]  There was a report I saw in the big New Zealand paper that a couple hundred sheep would cost $168,000 New Zealand dollars.
[01:09:48.362 --> 01:09:50.784]  And they're saying, this is all our profit, we have to shut down.
[01:09:51.805 --> 01:09:59.712]  They're announcing they're going to turn the lights off worldwide for a new holiday to teach you that power is bad and lights are bad for the earth, and this is feudalism.
[01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:18.048]  So to have it all openly being announced, what we read in government documents, what you read forty-something years ago, I read decades ago, it's now there, and I think, I'm trying to get everybody to kind of reset and remember that now people are ready to listen to us and now it's out in the open and I don't see many people even pointing this out, and that's upsetting to me.
[01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:18.528]  Everybody
[01:10:19.309 --> 01:10:21.670]  Needs to be going out and going, look, it's here!
[01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:29.674]  They're meeting to try to finalize this next Thursday, what, on April 2nd, and in subsequent meetings.
[01:10:29.674 --> 01:10:47.543]  So your take on world government coming out in the open, how they're going to try to phase it in, first with a global currency at the monetary level, that is the banks issuing their own currency for governments to be allowed to then issue their own currency, but it's just a denomination of that super currency, according to the London Telegraph, AP Reuters, and literally hundreds of other reports.
[01:10:48.223 --> 01:10:57.245]  So again, the public won't see the global currency yet in their hand, it's just their dollar is converting to a global system.
[01:10:57.245 --> 01:10:58.806]  True, and that's what they want to do.
[01:10:58.806 --> 01:11:07.088]  They want to use the special drawing rights which were drawn up in 1969 by the IMF.
[01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:14.610]  They were used before between governments and they were unsuccessful.
[01:11:15.755 --> 01:11:31.025]  And I think this trying to make these SDRs into a world currency for them is a terrible mistake because it's going to end up in failure like previous attempts were.
[01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:36.149]  They're probably better off trying if that's what they want to do.
[01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:44.314]  I don't know whether I should give many ideas or not, but I think they've been better off trying a basket of currencies, even though
[01:11:45.232 --> 01:11:49.753]  The basket of currencies would be fiat in nature.
[01:11:49.753 --> 01:11:52.094]  In other words... But they've been trying that for three years.
[01:11:52.094 --> 01:11:57.856]  I mean, they tried to do... Yeah, but I think, Alex, this is the way they're going to go on this.
[01:11:57.856 --> 01:12:03.458]  The SDRs are tradable between countries, but not individuals.
[01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:10.320]  And it still doesn't stop the near-term problem of sucking in dollars.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.461]  Or, you know, having dollars in your hand that you already have that
[01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:16.926]  Dropping in value.
[01:12:16.926 --> 01:12:21.909]  And so they've got to come up with something closer to the heart of the matter.
[01:12:21.909 --> 01:12:26.051]  And that's what this is going to be a big fight next week.
[01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:34.556]  And that's borne out by the manipulation of the stock market over the past 10 trading days.
[01:12:34.556 --> 01:12:36.798]  And it'll continue into next week.
[01:12:36.798 --> 01:12:42.521]  They wanted to get the market up as much as they could because of all the bad news that's coming.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.921]  All right, let me just back you up on that.
[01:12:44.921 --> 01:12:46.883]  I never played this clip.
[01:12:46.883 --> 01:12:50.926]  John, three days ago I sent you a Times of London video clip.
[01:12:50.926 --> 01:13:02.874]  They're now getting one of the Times and doing TV news in the House of Commons with the Governor of the Bank of England basically saying what Bob just said, that, hey, we've got to issue a totally new level
[01:13:03.895 --> 01:13:10.198]  of a monetary unit and not issue the currencies.
[01:13:10.198 --> 01:13:19.243]  He talks about how they're doing both right now, and then how the currencies, the dollars and others that are all being inflated will just feed back in to that in a loop.
[01:13:19.243 --> 01:13:20.584]  So dig that out, John.
[01:13:20.584 --> 01:13:28.328]  But I just wanted to add that for people that actually watch Parliament and watch the European Parliament and watch C-SPAN, this is all openly being debated right now.
[01:13:28.908 --> 01:13:33.890]  But again, they phrase it as, this is the solution to the global crisis, which they engineered.
[01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:38.711]  And then, whether you believe it was contrived, or engineered, or by accident, they admit it was engineered.
[01:13:38.711 --> 01:13:41.312]  Bob believes it's gotten out of control, and that may be true.
[01:13:41.312 --> 01:13:48.514]  The point here is, is that they plan to be the last man standing, and thus, king of the hill with world government when they're done with this.
[01:13:48.514 --> 01:13:51.215]  But go ahead, Bob.
[01:13:51.215 --> 01:13:56.737]  Well, I don't think they're in a position
[01:13:57.597 --> 01:14:00.438]  To immediately replace the dollar.
[01:14:00.438 --> 01:14:03.339]  It'll have to be done over some period of time.
[01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:05.379]  It might take six months to a year.
[01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:09.541]  Yeah, they said they're going to do it over three in most of the reports I've seen.
[01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:14.222]  And then what they have to do is choose the currencies they want to work with.
[01:14:14.222 --> 01:14:19.604]  Well, the USDX index, including the dollar, is seven major currencies.
[01:14:19.604 --> 01:14:23.965]  They're probably best going that way, which would include the dollar as well.
[01:14:23.965 --> 01:14:26.066]  But it doesn't solve the long term problem.
[01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:47.748]  And maybe that's not of any interest to them because they think that what they will be able to do is to graduate this new basket, we'll call it, of currencies for the period that they need before they allow the whole thing economically and financially to collapse.
[01:14:47.748 --> 01:14:49.630]  And then they'll come up with the idea of having
[01:14:50.291 --> 01:15:03.398]  A digital currency for the entire world and it will be supposedly based upon a gold backing and people still are not going to accept that because they have to give up their sovereignty.
[01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:11.342]  And so it's just another game that they're playing, but it's going to be very acrimonious because the U.S.
[01:15:11.342 --> 01:15:15.464]  elitists do not want to give up the power of the dollar.
[01:15:15.464 --> 01:15:19.806]  I mean, they've got a license to steal and they don't want to give that up.
[01:15:20.573 --> 01:15:30.556]  And they're still fighting with the European alumnus as to when there's going to be a phase-in to a world currency, like I just described.
[01:15:30.556 --> 01:15:37.559]  And they want to keep the dollar until then, so that they can continue to reap riches.
[01:15:37.559 --> 01:15:49.683]  And so, it's not only that that's going to be debated behind and in front of the scenes at the G20 meeting next week, but also they're going to try to
[01:15:52.221 --> 01:15:54.227]  Control all things financial.
[01:15:54.938 --> 01:15:57.699]  through one governing body worldwide.
[01:15:57.699 --> 01:15:59.000]  That was my next point.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.941]  That was my next question for you.
[01:16:01.941 --> 01:16:05.202]  While we're all debating, and they're getting us to debate, will we keep the dollar?
[01:16:05.202 --> 01:16:09.663]  And I get emails, people saying, why should I care if they get rid of the dollar?
[01:16:09.663 --> 01:16:10.284]  I'm not rich.
[01:16:10.284 --> 01:16:11.604]  I don't, you know, have money in the bank.
[01:16:11.604 --> 01:16:12.945]  I'm not a currency speculator.
[01:16:12.945 --> 01:16:14.505]  Folks, they've de-industrialized us.
[01:16:14.505 --> 01:16:19.627]  All we have left is our dollar to buy all these goods, you know, for most of our economy.
[01:16:19.627 --> 01:16:21.348]  And so this will devastate us
[01:16:22.148 --> 01:16:25.870]  Anyway, you slice it moving away from the dollar, so you do need to care.
[01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:29.192]  This affects you like nothing else financially ever will.
[01:16:29.192 --> 01:16:30.313]  So I want you to comment on that, Bob.
[01:16:30.313 --> 01:16:43.741]  And then, of course, the big issue is, regardless of what currency system they go with, they are openly, and I just played clips of the European Parliament, where they admit this, setting up, quote, a global European government, Europe dominating the planet.
[01:16:43.741 --> 01:16:44.461]  They said the U.S.
[01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:45.742]  will no longer dominate things.
[01:16:45.742 --> 01:16:46.903]  That's openly being announced.
[01:16:48.351 --> 01:16:58.996]  And that they will have taxing and policing authority on every nation on earth, and then the OECD and the UN States, they want an 85% tax rate across the board.
[01:16:58.996 --> 01:17:01.297]  So, this is complete bondage.
[01:17:01.297 --> 01:17:02.998]  Go ahead.
[01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:08.541]  Well, it's a combination, in fact, as you just pointed out.
[01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:17.505]  The taxation element, the element of world currency, world financial control under one body,
[01:17:18.181 --> 01:17:29.110]  Uh, and it looks like they want to phase in process, but the phase in process cannot last too long because of the state of the world economy, which is in a form of collapse.
[01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:30.631]  The world is in depression.
[01:17:30.631 --> 01:17:32.653]  They just don't know it yet.
[01:17:32.653 --> 01:17:41.520]  And so, you know, the question is, how far can they go with it and keep it from collapsing in total, totally?
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.443]  And the other, on the other hand, when do they want to do that?
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.901]  You know, their timing.
[01:17:48.901 --> 01:17:50.081]  Is it three years from now?
[01:17:50.081 --> 01:17:51.861]  Is it six years from now?
[01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:54.762]  Is it six months from now?
[01:17:54.762 --> 01:17:57.243]  I mean, you just don't know.
[01:17:57.243 --> 01:18:01.144]  And so these are the things they're trying to round up.
[01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:04.745]  And so there's a lot of facts to this.
[01:18:04.745 --> 01:18:07.266]  There's a lot of factions to it.
[01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:09.226]  And you're going to see that laid out.
[01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.527]  And that's why they ran the stock market up.
[01:18:11.527 --> 01:18:15.548]  That's why they hit gold twice in the big way in the last two weeks.
[01:18:16.246 --> 01:18:23.065]  Because they want gold to rise from a lower level, and they want the stock market to fall from a higher level.
[01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.008]  That's what they're up to.
[01:18:25.936 --> 01:18:37.580]  Because with this global manipulation, they make money on the way up and the way down, and once they get global total regulatory power, they almost have it now, they can manipulate everything to destroy nations, consolidate them.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.542]  It's just unlimited wrecking machine once they get that global government.
[01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:45.003]  As bad as their mischief has been so far, what will it be?
[01:18:45.003 --> 01:18:48.184]  Ten times worse on average when they get the superpower?
[01:18:48.184 --> 01:18:51.145]  Global control?
[01:18:51.145 --> 01:18:52.906]  It'll be an unlivable world.
[01:18:54.723 --> 01:18:59.947]  In conjunction with what we already know about living in the world.
[01:18:59.947 --> 01:19:02.750]  It's going to be nasty.
[01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:05.312]  Everybody's going to be unhappy.
[01:19:05.312 --> 01:19:13.559]  And if we don't face them down and stop them from doing what they're doing, then that's the way we're going to have to live.
[01:19:13.559 --> 01:19:16.162]  And I drove the sea revolution before that.
[01:19:16.892 --> 01:19:27.884]  Well, I just played a clip of members of the European Parliament from England telling Gordon Brown, they said, 90 plus percent of our country doesn't want the Euro, you're forcing us into it, you're going to have a revolt!
[01:19:27.884 --> 01:19:33.330]  And they were serious, and it cuts to Brown, he's just smiling like a hyena, that's what they want!
[01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:54.029]  Uh, so, but meanwhile, the American people are dancing around, going, there's no global government, there's no banks, there's no elites, there's no global currency, Alex and Bob Chapman are kooks, everything's fine, I like Rush Limbaugh, I like Obama, they... Just mindlessly skipping over the edge of the cliff.

[01:22:01.385 --> 01:22:06.634]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:13.294]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.294 --> 01:22:19.798]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.798 --> 01:22:21.779]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.779 --> 01:22:24.240]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:35.127]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.421 --> 01:22:39.082]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.082 --> 01:22:40.942]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:40.942 --> 01:22:47.845]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:56.108 --> 01:22:57.688]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.688 --> 01:22:58.869]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:02.826]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:23:02.826 --> 01:23:09.788]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:23:09.788 --> 01:23:18.171]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:23:18.171 --> 01:23:23.913]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:23:24.313 --> 01:23:25.915]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:23:25.915 --> 01:23:28.098]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:23:28.098 --> 01:23:32.644]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[01:23:50.202 --> 01:23:51.043]  We won't be left behind.
[01:23:51.043 --> 01:23:52.184]  Our memories live on forever.
[01:24:14.095 --> 01:24:17.295]  We'll ride again.
[01:24:17.295 --> 01:24:19.976]  Yeah, the bankman says he likes me.
[01:24:19.976 --> 01:24:24.317]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[01:24:24.317 --> 01:24:27.018]  I make a living off the land.
[01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:29.218]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[01:24:29.218 --> 01:24:31.499]  I'm a liberated man.
[01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:36.420]  The rain, it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:39.241]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[01:24:41.158 --> 01:24:46.262]  Alright, Bob Chapman, I want to go through these questions I've got for you quickly.
[01:24:46.262 --> 01:24:51.366]  They plan to bring the world into a global crisis, into a deeper crisis.
[01:24:51.366 --> 01:24:54.869]  They have done that now.
[01:25:09.346 --> 01:25:17.188]  But for the average American who doesn't care about global currencies, can you explain to them why this is so important?
[01:25:17.188 --> 01:25:23.550]  It's important because we owe so much money to the remainder of the world.
[01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:31.153]  They're holding close to $3 trillion worth of Treasury and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds.
[01:25:31.153 --> 01:25:38.975]  And if the world starts to dump dollars and not buy those bonds and other investments,
[01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:42.532]  In the United States, we will go bankrupt.
[01:25:42.532 --> 01:25:54.614]  Right this minute, we need 1.8, 1.9 billion dollars a day to meet our requirements for foreign trade.
[01:25:54.614 --> 01:25:58.915]  It's called the balance of payments surplus and deficit.
[01:25:58.915 --> 01:26:00.595]  And we're in a deficit.
[01:26:00.595 --> 01:26:05.636]  So it's very important what the world thinks of the dollar because
[01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:18.417]  If the dollar goes down in value, all the goods that you buy, and most of them come from other countries now, are going to be much more expensive.
[01:26:18.417 --> 01:26:26.203]  In the past, what countries have done is denigrated the value of their currencies to make their goods cheap.
[01:26:26.203 --> 01:26:33.828]  That was good for America because it kept inflation down, and they also took that money and bought those bonds I spoke of.
[01:26:34.713 --> 01:26:43.840]  If they stop buying the bonds and their products are more expensive, they're not going to sell as much, and you're going to have to pay more for what you do buy.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.024]  So you're going to have a depression with higher prices, because you already have a depression.
[01:26:49.024 --> 01:26:55.048]  You just don't know it yet, because your government will never probably tell you officially that it is a depression.
[01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:59.792]  And by the way, they've been inflating the other currency, before you finish, before I forget, I want to throw this in and get your take on it.
[01:27:00.663 --> 01:27:15.888]  They're also throwing in the fact that in England, the Bank of England has, and the Treasury in England, the Exchequer, for the first time ever has been putting out their own bonds and people aren't buying them, so they're having to come in and buy themselves.
[01:27:15.888 --> 01:27:24.351]  We know the Fed and the Treasury have been doing that, but quietly, so we're already seeing the fact that people can't even buy it to begin with.
[01:27:24.351 --> 01:27:28.512]  Well, they started in the United States, the Fed started this week, buying
[01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:33.213]  Treasury paper, and they did so by creating money out of thin air.
[01:27:33.213 --> 01:27:35.354]  It's called monetization.
[01:27:35.354 --> 01:27:41.998]  And, yes, the British have done that, and the Swiss have been doing it with corporate bonds, which is very surprising.
[01:27:41.998 --> 01:27:51.004]  And so, you're going to continue to see this kind of thing going on in many countries, but the point is it's highly inflationary.
[01:27:51.004 --> 01:27:57.268]  Here you have high unemployment, getting worse, and inflation keeps on going up in the middle of the Depression.
[01:27:57.268 --> 01:27:58.589]  It's the worst of all worlds.
[01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:04.155]  You know, I want to say one more thing about the previous conversation.
[01:28:04.155 --> 01:28:16.139]  I talked to a very, very reliable source in Europe this week, and they told me that the people in Europe are royally, royally PO to what's going on.
[01:28:16.139 --> 01:28:20.500]  There is going to be a knockdown drag out fight next week.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.801]  I mean, really nasty.
[01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:28.543]  And this will be the European nations and Britain and the United States going at it.
[01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:33.253]  And, you know, we're talking about monetization.
[01:28:33.253 --> 01:28:38.717]  The first batch that the Treasury has asked for is $300 billion.
[01:28:38.717 --> 01:28:44.881]  And that means because they can't sell the amount of bonds that they have to foreigners.
[01:28:44.881 --> 01:28:55.868]  In January, the latest period we have figures for, the foreigners cut back by $148 billion the amount of bonds that they were willing to buy.
[01:28:55.868 --> 01:28:58.250]  That's a very, very, very high figure.
[01:28:59.053 --> 01:29:04.175]  Now, $300 billion is not going to make it.
[01:29:04.175 --> 01:29:09.497]  Within the next three months, they're going to come and tell you they need an additional trillion.
[01:29:09.497 --> 01:29:24.683]  That's $1.3 trillion in total, never mind what they've done secretly behind the scenes in Washington or what they've been doing offshore for another $100 billion during that time frame and before that.
[01:29:24.683 --> 01:29:26.264]  See, the government never tells the truth.
[01:29:26.264 --> 01:29:27.104]  All they do is lie.
[01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:33.412]  So we're talking about colossal amounts of money being monetized.
[01:29:33.412 --> 01:29:40.735]  I figure that over this next two years, this year and next year, they'll monetize over five trillion dollars.
[01:29:40.735 --> 01:29:44.657]  And that is going to create hyperinflation, the likes of which the world has never seen.
[01:29:44.657 --> 01:29:46.898]  Break it down for us, Bob, when we come back.
[01:29:46.898 --> 01:29:48.439]  But I'm getting into the FEMA camp.
[01:29:48.439 --> 01:29:51.360]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.262]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.294 --> 01:30:01.177]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.177 --> 01:30:06.900]  How would you like to finally be debt-free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[01:30:08.527 --> 01:30:08.967]  I think so.
[01:30:26.039 --> 01:30:26.740]  We're good to go.
[01:30:48.061 --> 01:30:50.722]  Call 718-615-0123.
[01:30:50.722 --> 01:30:54.003]  That's 718-615-0123.

[01:31:01.586 --> 01:31:07.408]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.408 --> 01:31:14.390]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.975 --> 01:31:21.537]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.537 --> 01:31:23.538]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.538 --> 01:31:26.039]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.039 --> 01:31:36.822]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.606 --> 01:31:39.266]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.266 --> 01:31:41.127]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:41.127 --> 01:31:48.028]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.290 --> 01:31:57.871]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.871 --> 01:31:59.071]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.845 --> 01:32:04.826]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[01:32:04.826 --> 01:32:09.668]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[01:32:09.668 --> 01:32:12.588]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[01:32:12.588 --> 01:32:16.890]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:19.230]  We're good to go.
[01:32:44.298 --> 01:32:44.678]  We're good.
[01:33:10.737 --> 01:33:12.840]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:16.865]  to 3 p.m., ladies and gentlemen, we are here live.
[01:33:17.816 --> 01:33:25.099]  Now I've got a call to action for the listeners on two different points and two different issues that I'm going to cover here in just a moment.
[01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.941]  Start your engines, X-Wings.
[01:33:27.941 --> 01:33:33.603]  We are going in and we're going to blow the living daylights out of the New World Order Death Star.
[01:33:33.603 --> 01:33:42.648]  And we'll go back in over and over again until we have warned everybody on this planet and the Resistance mounts to a level where their world government will fall!
[01:33:45.492 --> 01:33:48.614]  And nothing can stop you if you just turn it loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:48.614 --> 01:33:52.496]  You have the power.
[01:33:52.496 --> 01:33:53.676]  You truly want to live?
[01:33:53.676 --> 01:33:56.758]  Join the side of good against darkness.
[01:33:56.758 --> 01:33:58.159]  And ask God for guidance.
[01:33:59.429 --> 01:34:09.233]  Ask God to be a vessel against tyranny to defend the meek and the weak, the widows, and to stay the hand of the wicked ones.
[01:34:09.233 --> 01:34:13.915]  Yeah, the God of this world's in control, but not for long.
[01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:15.056]  Ha ha!
[01:34:15.056 --> 01:34:16.777]  I love it!
[01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:23.360]  The awakening has entered its final phase.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:26.181]  And the tyrants are in great fear.
[01:34:38.682 --> 01:34:42.545]  All right, let's go back to Bob Chapman, and I want Bob to take on the whole FEMA camp clip.
[01:34:42.545 --> 01:34:44.726]  It's only a few minutes long, we're going to play here.
[01:34:44.726 --> 01:34:50.449]  And we got Jason Burmas in the studio, who first alerted me this yesterday afternoon when Beck announced his radio show.
[01:34:50.449 --> 01:34:55.152]  He was going to be debunking it that night, and then he had probably mechanics on us that the big debunking is coming up.
[01:34:56.252 --> 01:35:00.314]  On April 6th, which is very important, a call to action in one moment.
[01:35:00.314 --> 01:35:03.415]  But going back to Bob Chapman, the internationalforecaster.com.
[01:35:03.415 --> 01:35:06.536]  Bob, hyperinflation.
[01:35:06.536 --> 01:35:12.639]  I mean, what type of inflation are we talking about with trillions in monetized debt?
[01:35:12.639 --> 01:35:18.541]  Well, we're running around 9 to 10 percent right now without the monetization.
[01:35:18.541 --> 01:35:25.264]  I firmly believe that secretly they did about $300 billion over the last four months, plus the $300 billion they just did.
[01:35:25.973 --> 01:35:33.878]  That puts them up to about $162 billion, so they'll be out of the $300 billion category pretty shortly.
[01:35:33.878 --> 01:35:37.000]  And that means that they'll have to ask for more money.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:50.368]  And that means inflation will move up to where it was, 13.6%, about 9 or 10 months ago, before they had this deleveraging process, as it's been called.
[01:35:50.368 --> 01:35:55.551]  And that's when banks cut back lending, and because they did that,
[01:35:56.517 --> 01:36:00.360]  Many entities had to sell things, particularly hedge funds.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:10.126]  And that's why the market came down and other sorts of investments came down as well, including commercial real estate, which is in real trouble now.
[01:36:10.126 --> 01:36:17.451]  And so inflation, I think there's a good chance it'll be back up by the end of the year to 13.6%.
[01:36:17.451 --> 01:36:24.996]  And then as they continue to monetize and continue to increase money and credit in general,
[01:36:26.282 --> 01:36:29.424]  Then we'll get up into the 20s and 30s.
[01:36:29.424 --> 01:36:32.306]  How far it can go beyond that, I don't know.
[01:36:32.306 --> 01:36:33.587]  It all depends on what they do.
[01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:35.088]  It's too hard to call.
[01:36:35.088 --> 01:36:41.551]  But I think you can look forward, and you're not going to relish this, of 20 to 30 percent inflation.
[01:36:41.551 --> 01:36:50.257]  And you know, that's why it's so hard for other nations to invest in, say, 10-year, which is long-term U.S.
[01:36:50.257 --> 01:36:50.537]  notes.
[01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:56.473]  At 2.7%, when they know inflation, real inflation, is 10%.
[01:36:56.473 --> 01:37:15.127]  They're already taking a beating, and then they're facing the possibility of a dollar not being the only reserve currency, or the reserve currency, having a drop in value perhaps versus their currency, and maybe they're going to take another 30% loss on top of it.
[01:37:15.127 --> 01:37:18.350]  Well, look at Eastern European currencies plunging.
[01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.831]  They're already in total depression.
[01:37:21.499 --> 01:37:35.789]  Well, that's true, and it's all the fault of the Western bankers who gave them cheap loans, propped them up, and everything started to slow down, and they got caught in the middle of the meat grinder.
[01:37:35.789 --> 01:37:41.553]  And they're not going to recover for a long time, but neither is the remainder of the world.
[01:37:41.553 --> 01:37:43.455]  Things are going to be very, very tough out there.
[01:37:43.863 --> 01:37:46.906]  All right, Bob Chapman, I'm going to play this.
[01:37:46.906 --> 01:37:49.729]  We're going to put you on hold and I want you to listen to this and give us your take when we come back.
[01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:56.776]  We're going to play this Glenn Beck clip, then I'm going to comment on it and I want your take on it and then Jason Bermas' take on it.
[01:37:56.776 --> 01:37:58.318]  Glenn Beck, he's going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:37:58.318 --> 01:38:00.540]  He's going to tell you the truth about the FEMA camps.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.541]  He's looking at it.
[01:38:02.362 --> 01:38:03.803]  It might be true.
[01:38:03.803 --> 01:38:20.635]  Meanwhile, it's in the Houston Chronicle, it's in the Miami Herald, it's admitted the public purchase orders in the last seven years, building them, open announcements, bills introduced to merge the local police and community groups into the camps, Schwarzenegger in California and folks in
[01:38:22.031 --> 01:38:31.854]  Hawaii are forcing the homeless out of their tent cities into barbed wire camps at their convention centers and of course at the fairgrounds.
[01:38:31.854 --> 01:38:33.234]  It's all happening.
[01:38:33.234 --> 01:38:36.675]  The military announces they're going to use 20,000 troops of the American people.
[01:38:36.675 --> 01:38:38.276]  All of it's public news.
[01:38:38.276 --> 01:38:42.837]  I have the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, Army Regulation 210-35.
[01:38:42.837 --> 01:38:44.217]  We'll go over that.
[01:38:44.217 --> 01:38:47.738]  But meanwhile they bring in the captains of yellow journalism.
[01:38:47.738 --> 01:38:49.939]  You know, we always make the joke of next to
[01:38:50.939 --> 01:38:54.042]  In the encyclopedia to uglies, a picture of you.
[01:38:54.042 --> 01:39:02.670]  No, no, literally in the encyclopedia next to yellow journalism is Hearst Publishing that publishes popular mechanics in the 9-11 debunkers.
[01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:06.634]  But this is publicly admitted there's FEMA camps.
[01:39:06.634 --> 01:39:13.740]  And so now they're going to deny basically, well it's like them denying there's a new world order as it's all over the newspapers.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.522]  So here it is, the debunkers.
[01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:23.773]  ...in here, James, that I called you, what, three, four weeks ago and asked you to help on a project.
[01:39:23.773 --> 01:39:28.194]  And that is, I really truly believe, America, we have a real problem in this country.
[01:39:28.194 --> 01:39:29.615]  We don't know what the truth is anymore.
[01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:31.036]  We don't have anybody we can trust.
[01:39:31.036 --> 01:39:41.420]  And there's a lot of stuff, and I've told you before, and I've told you for a long time on the Internet, please don't pass these things around on the Internet unless you know they're true.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:51.348]  And I think it is important for us to debunk those things or verify those things that are out there, because we're separating on the truth now.
[01:39:51.348 --> 01:39:54.871]  So I asked James from Popular Mechanics to do an investigation on several projects.
[01:39:54.871 --> 01:39:56.892]  The first one is the FEMA camp.
[01:39:56.892 --> 01:40:03.918]  Yes, and so we put a reporter on this, and what's so interesting here, we're waiting to really do a definitive deep dig on this.
[01:40:03.918 --> 01:40:07.101]  We don't like to just come out and say, oh, we've debunked it, you know, after we've looked at it for two days.
[01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:12.423]  But it looks, from our early reporting, like a classic conspiracy theory.
[01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:15.865]  Little grains of truth, but all adding up to something that really isn't true.
[01:40:15.865 --> 01:40:19.686]  Okay, I want to, because I want to go, I want to, when do we have this ready?
[01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:20.907]  Next, a week from Monday?
[01:40:20.907 --> 01:40:21.187]  Yeah.
[01:40:21.187 --> 01:40:22.708]  A week from Monday.
[01:40:22.708 --> 01:40:24.489]  This is one of those things that
[01:40:27.281 --> 01:40:29.783]  They are so specific on the internet.
[01:40:29.783 --> 01:40:38.290]  And this is why I was going to do an expose on this, and I thought that we had some of the things from the internet, and we weren't ready to go on with them.
[01:40:38.290 --> 01:40:47.036]  All we had was the grains of truth and the things that we knew were false in this, but we didn't have that definitive, they show this picture, here it is.
[01:40:47.036 --> 01:40:48.757]  They show this picture, there it is.
[01:40:48.757 --> 01:40:50.279]  And that's why we called you.
[01:40:50.279 --> 01:40:53.421]  Well, yes, and you know, you remember all the 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:40:53.561 --> 01:40:54.061]  We're good to go.
[01:41:22.014 --> 01:41:25.577]  And then, of course, the GIVE Act in both versions had compulsory service.
[01:41:25.577 --> 01:41:26.138]  We read it.
[01:41:26.138 --> 01:41:27.559]  It was in the New York Times.
[01:41:27.559 --> 01:41:29.201]  Then, thank God, people were putting pressure on them.
[01:41:29.201 --> 01:41:31.703]  It went into conference, and I've had the guys reading it.
[01:41:31.703 --> 01:41:36.248]  They did take it out, though they're setting up the funding and the grid and the studies to do it.
[01:41:36.248 --> 01:41:38.590]  So, see, this is how they're going to attack it.
[01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:46.737]  There are thousands of websites, thousands of photos, hundreds and hundreds of videos, where they'll go show an urban warfare training center, say, in Mississippi.
[01:41:47.398 --> 01:41:52.161]  And it's got foxholes, it's got camp barbed wire, it's got barbed wire facing in.
[01:41:52.161 --> 01:41:53.101]  And it's dual use.
[01:41:53.101 --> 01:41:59.145]  You can do training, as they say it's training for Kosovo, but it can also be used for a camp.
[01:41:59.145 --> 01:42:01.486]  Just like the Manazar prison camp they held Japanese in.
[01:42:01.486 --> 01:42:03.027]  They reopened that back in 1998.
[01:42:03.027 --> 01:42:03.927]  It's still reopened.
[01:42:03.927 --> 01:42:04.968]  They refurbished it.
[01:42:04.968 --> 01:42:07.489]  It's sitting there empty, a prison camp.
[01:42:07.489 --> 01:42:15.434]  So what they're going to do is they're going to go show, watch, camps that are dual use and say, oh look, we talked to the military, it's just a training facility.
[01:42:16.317 --> 01:42:17.618]  Discredited.
[01:42:17.618 --> 01:42:24.646]  But then they won't go to Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, Army Regulation 210-35, unclassified.
[01:42:24.646 --> 01:42:29.170]  Now, from 86 to 97, they held Americans in camps.
[01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:29.771]  It's all in here.
[01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:30.372]  You can just Google it.
[01:42:30.372 --> 01:42:31.213]  You'll be at army.mil.
[01:42:33.956 --> 01:42:36.138]  I'll give you the phone number to the Army Headquarters if you'd like to call them.
[01:42:36.138 --> 01:42:37.880]  It's right here in the report.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:38.901]  They're proud of this.
[01:42:38.901 --> 01:42:40.482]  It was secret for 11 years.
[01:42:40.482 --> 01:42:41.623]  Then they announced it.
[01:42:41.623 --> 01:42:44.486]  And now there's not 12 camps, there's 24 with people in them.
[01:42:44.486 --> 01:42:45.987]  And they're like, well, they're federal prisoners.
[01:42:45.987 --> 01:42:49.731]  You know, the non-military prisoners, but they're under military control and it's a labor camp.
[01:42:50.512 --> 01:42:52.413]  What is wrong with that?
[01:42:52.413 --> 01:42:58.335]  See, these guys were convicted of bank robbery and child molestation, whatever.
[01:42:58.335 --> 01:43:01.316]  So see, they integrate the troops in the military where this is normal.
[01:43:01.316 --> 01:43:04.017]  Just like they say, oh, the Marines are out at a checkpoint to look for drunks.
[01:43:04.017 --> 01:43:06.258]  Oh, the Army's helping at wrecks.
[01:43:06.258 --> 01:43:09.119]  Oh, there's liaison officers in all the police departments from the Army.
[01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:14.741]  But then you read the Army reports, and we've read the codes, and it's been in the Army Times, they're going to use them against the American people, 20,000.
[01:43:16.582 --> 01:43:17.923]  You heard him say they're going to debunk a bunch of stuff.
[01:43:17.923 --> 01:43:19.283]  They're going to have them on every week.
[01:43:19.283 --> 01:43:26.287]  They're going to say, yeah, they're going to use CRIBS, but it's just to help with car wrecks when the Army document says it's for total takeover and the Army War College.
[01:43:26.287 --> 01:43:28.948]  They're going to show camps that aren't really camps.
[01:43:28.948 --> 01:43:31.309]  So it's straw men, classic straw men.
[01:43:31.309 --> 01:43:32.330]  And yes, there's baloney.
[01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:36.232]  They'll go show an empty warehouse and say it's a FEMA camp when it's not in Chicago.
[01:43:36.852 --> 01:43:44.301]  But, you know, I saw people put in Pier 57 in New York, in the bus terminal, same thing, bar-bar fences, porta-potties inside, sleeping on the floor.
[01:43:44.301 --> 01:43:46.304]  They have one at Austin, I have local news admitting it.
[01:43:46.304 --> 01:43:49.107]  You know, it's the police saying they have this federally paid for.
[01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:51.291]  So this is how they're going to do it.
[01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:54.552]  You notice he says, we're going to debunk a bunch of stuff.
[01:43:54.552 --> 01:43:56.553]  And so they have to say, oh, there's a kernel of truth.
[01:43:56.553 --> 01:44:00.816]  Yeah, there's a bill introduced for emergency camps for when society breaks down.
[01:44:00.816 --> 01:44:02.016]  What do the Nazis say?
[01:44:02.016 --> 01:44:06.579]  Hey, you know, people are beating up you Jews and people, we've got camps for your safety.
[01:44:06.579 --> 01:44:08.820]  And we've also going to delouse you.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.341]  And, you know, we're going to take you here.
[01:44:11.441 --> 01:44:12.762]  Uh, that's what the Soviets did.
[01:44:12.762 --> 01:44:15.883]  I mean, see, they're not going to come out and say, we've built death camps, we're going to get you.
[01:44:15.883 --> 01:44:20.204]  It's, oh no, the governor of California, you know, there's all these tent cities.
[01:44:20.204 --> 01:44:29.387]  He's taking federal funds and putting them in a safe facility where the CPS is there and there's barbed wire facing in and regular families that are living in their cars and tents while they raise money to get an apartment, which is happening.
[01:44:29.387 --> 01:44:34.109]  You've got to now be with the crackheads and the mentally ill people, the regular homeless folks and the drunks.
[01:44:34.109 --> 01:44:36.130]  And then there'll be crime and they admit all that.
[01:44:36.690 --> 01:44:40.071]  So see, this is all, this is how they introduce it to you.
[01:44:40.071 --> 01:44:42.352]  They don't introduce it, ooh, it's bad and scary.
[01:44:42.352 --> 01:44:45.813]  Bob Chapman, your comments on this.
[01:44:45.813 --> 01:45:01.018]  Well, first of all, I think the three main points that he was trying to make was that they don't want people to trust what's on the internet.
[01:45:01.824 --> 01:45:06.945]  They kept on saying, well, this has to be verified and that has to be thrown out because it's not true.
[01:45:06.945 --> 01:45:13.447]  They're supposedly going through an investigation.
[01:45:13.447 --> 01:45:19.788]  One, in fact, as you say, all of the facts on this particular issue are all there.
[01:45:19.788 --> 01:45:23.749]  Don't bring in facts about anything else that you doubt.
[01:45:23.749 --> 01:45:30.591]  And of course, the first thing they threw at the audience was it fits in the realm
[01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:59.541]  of conspiracy theory and of course that that strong warning about the Internet not being a place where you can get verified information if you may and they said that out of hand so far that there is no FEMA camps and it's just conspiracy theorists and of course you pointed out
[01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:08.652]  That they are what they are and how Fox and Popular Mechanics will try to get around this.
[01:46:08.652 --> 01:46:16.916]  What I was surprised at is that the man that he interviewed really didn't have any information whatsoever.
[01:46:18.147 --> 01:46:20.288]  I thought it had to be a little embarrassing.
[01:46:20.288 --> 01:46:25.571]  Well, notice they said, we looked at this and there's all these kernels.
[01:46:25.571 --> 01:46:26.752]  See, they don't want you integrated.
[01:46:26.752 --> 01:46:33.116]  Listen, FEMA is on record in hundreds of newspapers, Newsmax, that advertises on Fox.
[01:46:33.116 --> 01:46:36.478]  Right after the clip, there was a Newsmax ad for their magazine.
[01:46:36.478 --> 01:46:37.758]  Newsmax, Christopher Ruddy in 2002,
[01:46:39.099 --> 01:46:47.404]  Saw the Federal Purchase Order put out for bids for three one million man camps during natural disasters or terrorist attack or breakdown of society.
[01:46:47.404 --> 01:46:49.205]  And they got all these emails saying it wasn't real.
[01:46:49.205 --> 01:46:51.467]  And Christopher Ruddy, we gotta dig this up.
[01:46:51.467 --> 01:46:57.691]  This is 2002, wrote, the exact headline was, yes folks, the FEMA camp story is real.
[01:46:57.691 --> 01:46:58.271]  Something like that.
[01:46:58.271 --> 01:46:59.712]  Yes, the camp story is real.
[01:46:59.712 --> 01:47:02.834]  And he gave the phone number to the Federal Purchase Office.
[01:47:03.354 --> 01:47:09.356]  I mean, that's how the Houston Chronicle learned about the next wave in 2006 of camps.
[01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:26.183]  They've got a stinking FEMA camp in Taylor with people in it right now, and as Rex84 said in the congressional hearings, first they put illegals in to vet it and test it and train the people, but it has dual use for citizens to be held extrajudicially, just like the Military Commissions Act clearly states.
[01:47:26.183 --> 01:47:28.464]  Bob Chapman.
[01:47:28.464 --> 01:47:31.625]  What we have to do is don't let them get it off the ground.
[01:47:31.625 --> 01:47:32.826]  The minute they try to
[01:47:33.736 --> 01:47:38.680]  Uh, debunk the camp situation.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:42.622]  You gotta go right after them and attack them from every angle.
[01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.423]  That's what we're doing.
[01:47:43.423 --> 01:47:46.645]  Because they don't have anything to debunk it.
[01:47:46.645 --> 01:47:48.886]  I mean, they're lying about it.
[01:47:48.886 --> 01:47:52.108]  And it's just like this man, he had on there.
[01:47:52.108 --> 01:47:54.470]  He had no information whatsoever.
[01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:56.611]  Well, here's another issue.
[01:47:56.611 --> 01:47:58.653]  Meg's used to write for... He danced around the subject.
[01:47:59.457 --> 01:48:01.579]  Megs doesn't even have any journalism degree.
[01:48:01.579 --> 01:48:03.000]  Megs, from what I've read, wrote for TV Guide.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.401]  It was Entertainment Weekly.
[01:48:05.401 --> 01:48:06.162]  Oh, Entertainment Weekly.
[01:48:06.162 --> 01:48:08.784]  Excuse me, I'll go ahead and turn Burmese to Jason Burmese.
[01:48:08.784 --> 01:48:11.826]  Knows these guys, has debated them, now they refuse to debate us.
[01:48:11.826 --> 01:48:15.409]  Here's one example out of their debunking a 9-11 mess book.
[01:48:15.409 --> 01:48:17.650]  Okay, here's one of the lies of hundreds.
[01:48:17.650 --> 01:48:26.797]  They say NORAD only intercepted one airplane in the year before 9-11, and that was Payne Stewart, because I know folks all heard about that, and they intercepted it in 17 minutes, with six F-16s.
[01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:43.417]  Then we just googled the name of the guy they quoted, the NORAD spokesman, this colonel, and there he was in Reuters and AP, when Payne Stewart happened and other events, saying we've had 167 intercepts in the last nine months before 9-11.
[01:48:44.702 --> 01:48:50.967]  Okay, in the first nine months of that year, 167, if memory serves, 167, 168, 167.
[01:48:50.967 --> 01:49:01.456]  And so one time Megs was on another show on Genesis, and I called into the show, and I said, you won't debate me, but I said, here's the Reuters article, and here's his name, and he said, I'm not going to discuss that.
[01:49:02.196 --> 01:49:07.001]  See, they will not, they are lying trash.
[01:49:07.001 --> 01:49:10.686]  And I call them out here on air, they are lying trash.
[01:49:10.686 --> 01:49:15.551]  They said a third of Building 7 was scooped out, and the fuel oil did it.
[01:49:15.551 --> 01:49:19.335]  NIST, Jason, admits that that isn't what did it now, and they say they don't know what happened.
[01:49:19.335 --> 01:49:23.580]  Yeah, they took the quote from Cheyenne Sunder, who had to get up and say that that was just not true at all.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.202]  Um, you know, he said, uh, there wasn't any significant damage to the building and it turns out it wasn't the fuel oil tanks.
[01:49:29.202 --> 01:49:31.002]  It looks like it was thermal expansion.
[01:49:31.002 --> 01:49:35.703]  There's never been a retraction or an addendum to that hit piece that they wrote.
[01:49:35.703 --> 01:49:41.285]  I mean, I think the best thing about this, Alex, is we are continuing to expose Glenn Beck as a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:49:41.285 --> 01:49:44.706]  I mean, we've had a lot of pressure over the last few months in this office alone.
[01:49:45.006 --> 01:49:49.788]  Emails telling us no, Glenn Beck is coming around, he's telling us the truth about the financial institutions.
[01:49:49.788 --> 01:49:50.848]  No, he does this every year.
[01:49:50.848 --> 01:49:56.191]  He comes out and says there's a New World Order, Law of the Sea Treaty, and then lets arrest all the wrong supporters and use troops against them.
[01:49:56.191 --> 01:49:57.511]  They're dangerous enemies.
[01:49:57.511 --> 01:50:02.733]  Then he comes out, oh you can trust me, I'm going to fight the New World Order, and then says yeah, this is all a bunch of bull.
[01:50:02.733 --> 01:50:09.476]  Now that you trust me, don't trust the internet, trust me, I'm going to debunk this with the fathers of yellow journalism.
[01:50:09.656 --> 01:50:17.606]  Yeah, and the fact that he's putting together a quote-unquote 9-12 project that he's very proud that over a quarter million people have joined really churns in my stomach.
[01:50:17.606 --> 01:50:19.248]  I mean, this guy is trying to piggyback.
[01:50:19.248 --> 01:50:24.054]  Which is what the forced compulsory service bills state.
[01:50:24.054 --> 01:50:27.899]  They say it's going to be a 9-11, 9-12 project where they do all this in the name of 9-11.
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:31.462]  Yeah, a 9-11 call to service day.
[01:51:01.265 --> 01:51:03.850]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:51:04.477 --> 01:51:07.820]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.603]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:51:11.603 --> 01:51:18.189]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:23.413]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:51:23.413 --> 01:51:30.119]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:51:30.419 --> 01:51:31.500]  Need something more?
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.462]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[01:51:35.462 --> 01:51:43.768]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[01:51:43.768 --> 01:51:48.111]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[01:51:48.391 --> 01:51:52.154]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.925 --> 01:52:13.809]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.809 --> 01:52:20.314]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.314 --> 01:52:22.295]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.295 --> 01:52:24.737]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.737 --> 01:52:35.565]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.930 --> 01:52:39.591]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.591 --> 01:52:41.452]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.452 --> 01:52:48.357]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:54:13.365 --> 01:54:18.387]  By the way, we've been on government track on thomas.loc.gov, Library of Congress.
[01:54:18.387 --> 01:54:23.549]  They have not put out Paul Watson's check, Burmese's check all morning, I checked last night.
[01:54:23.549 --> 01:54:25.290]  There is no full copy of the bill.
[01:54:25.290 --> 01:54:26.510]  I guess it's still being bandied about.
[01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:27.811]  There's all these different versions going on.
[01:54:27.811 --> 01:54:34.333]  So they've got versions that do say Compulsory National Service, Youth Corps, Environmental Corps, Senior Corps, 18 to 24.
[01:54:34.333 --> 01:54:35.474]  We have the video clips.
[01:54:36.494 --> 01:54:36.855]  I think so.
[01:54:53.510 --> 01:55:01.712]  We're going to fight the New World Order, and now we learn, oh, it's teaming up with Popular Mechanics to fight people, talking about FEMA camps, talking about compulsory service, talking about the New World Order.
[01:55:01.712 --> 01:55:03.153]  I mean, this is Fox News, folks.
[01:55:03.153 --> 01:55:08.174]  This guy is worse than those that are openly globalist, because at least they're honest about what they're doing.
[01:55:08.174 --> 01:55:10.455]  He is a Judas Goat, a Benedict Arnold...
[01:55:11.275 --> 01:55:14.156]  A treasonous, treacherous piece of filth.
[01:55:14.156 --> 01:55:16.137]  And I challenge Glenn Beck.
[01:55:16.137 --> 01:55:17.017]  I'll do it next Tuesday.
[01:55:17.017 --> 01:55:18.058]  I'll just set a date.
[01:55:18.058 --> 01:55:19.738]  I'll get all my material together.
[01:55:19.738 --> 01:55:23.340]  A two hour, we'll put it up on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:29.562]  We'll put it up, I'll just change the channel because he has a YouTube account that can put up large videos.
[01:55:29.562 --> 01:55:33.924]  I'll try to keep it about an hour and a half of actual air time.
[01:55:33.924 --> 01:55:36.085]  We'll do a whole documentary here on air.
[01:55:36.085 --> 01:55:38.786]  And I'll go through all the video clips, articles, we've got hundreds of them.
[01:55:39.306 --> 01:55:41.249]  And I'm going to say, okay, debunk this.
[01:55:41.249 --> 01:55:43.172]  Don't go out and pick straw men.
[01:55:43.172 --> 01:55:45.796]  You debunk the civilian inmate labor camp program, punk.
[01:55:45.796 --> 01:55:51.424]  You debunk the FEMA camps and the bills and the Houston Chronicle and the Miami Herald.
[01:55:51.424 --> 01:55:52.726]  You debunk that.
[01:55:52.726 --> 01:55:53.948]  And here's my call to action.
[01:55:53.948 --> 01:55:55.030]  I want to get Bob's take on it.
[01:55:56.477 --> 01:56:00.078]  On top of Webster Tarpley coming to town for the second Obama film, I'll be working all weekend.
[01:56:00.078 --> 01:56:04.880]  I am going to, this weekend, also get all my material ready for next Tuesday.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.261]  We're going to launch it live on air at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:07.261 --> 01:56:09.262]  I'll clear the decks for two hours.
[01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:11.162]  We'll post it by Wednesday.
[01:56:11.162 --> 01:56:13.483]  It'll be up on the web for everybody on YouTube and everywhere else.
[01:56:13.483 --> 01:56:18.665]  And I want everybody, the video we pick, you know, that we think is the clearest upload of it, for free, just like with
[01:56:19.245 --> 01:56:21.066]  The Obama deception to change the channel.
[01:56:21.066 --> 01:56:29.750]  We are going to put that out for everybody, and then we want to have it, like, have a million views by the next Tuesday, when they do the debunking, or the next Monday.
[01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:31.190]  And I think we can do that.
[01:56:31.190 --> 01:56:33.231]  I mean, there's all these versions.
[01:56:33.231 --> 01:56:36.292]  I mean, now it's up to change the channels of over 700,000 views.
[01:56:36.292 --> 01:56:39.654]  There's hundreds of other versions with hundreds of thousands of views, so it's more than 10 million views.
[01:56:39.654 --> 01:56:42.475]  But if we can have it on one video, it can have a million views.
[01:56:43.115 --> 01:56:45.157]  And it'll be a challenge to Glenn Beck.
[01:56:45.157 --> 01:56:46.979]  Here's the evidence, you lazy ass.
[01:56:46.979 --> 01:56:49.201]  Don't claim that you didn't know about this.
[01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:51.063]  Now, that's call to action number one.
[01:56:51.063 --> 01:56:55.688]  The next few weeks, on every Friday, we've created activist pages at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:55.688 --> 01:56:59.892]  The best place to find it is go to ObamaDeception.net or TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:56:59.892 --> 01:57:01.193]  Both addresses will get you there.
[01:57:01.193 --> 01:57:02.354]  It says activism.
[01:57:02.354 --> 01:57:05.758]  We've created these flyers you can print out and put on walls.
[01:57:05.758 --> 01:57:06.739]  We put out a MySpace.
[01:57:07.499 --> 01:57:15.008]  Saying I'm Not Deceived, little ribbon, red ribbon you put up at the top of the corner of your page, the text of the Obama deception, banners that say I'm Not Deceived.
[01:57:15.008 --> 01:57:16.409]  We need your help to get this out.
[01:57:16.409 --> 01:57:17.731]  I put the film out for free.
[01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:20.054]  You can buy the high quality DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:20.054 --> 01:57:21.195]  Why not have it in your library?
[01:57:21.195 --> 01:57:21.595]  Support us.
[01:57:22.376 --> 01:57:22.856]  We're good to go.
[01:57:44.848 --> 01:57:46.990]  Best encoder I've ever seen at YouTube.
[01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:49.212]  There's all these things we can do.
[01:57:49.212 --> 01:57:54.017]  I want you to at least show the Obama deception to one person and email it to your email list.
[01:57:54.017 --> 01:57:56.299]  Post it on a couple message boards this weekend.
[01:57:56.299 --> 01:58:00.883]  I want it to be, on the Change the Channel version, over a million by Monday.
[01:58:01.423 --> 01:58:02.043]  Now that's easy.
[01:58:02.043 --> 01:58:04.724]  We've been getting about 90,000 views a day in the last week as it accelerates.
[01:58:04.724 --> 01:58:05.965]  It's on that one channel.
[01:58:05.965 --> 01:58:07.305]  And all the others are getting a lot of views too.
[01:58:07.305 --> 01:58:12.327]  I want it to be over a million on Monday, and I want it to be two million by the next Monday.
[01:58:12.327 --> 01:58:15.689]  So Bob Chapman, you can do a little bit more with us so I can get your take on that idea.
[01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.951]  Yes, I'll be here.
[01:58:17.951 --> 01:58:21.553]  Okay, we'll be back in 70 seconds with Jason Bermes and you for two more segments.
[01:58:21.553 --> 01:58:28.138]  Then we've got a doctor coming on to talk about medical poisoning and what's happening on that front and a bunch of other news.
[01:58:28.138 --> 01:58:31.961]  But again, get The Obama Deception on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:31.961 --> 01:58:32.822]  Order it now.
[01:58:32.822 --> 01:58:34.263]  Ship it right out to your UPS.
[01:58:34.263 --> 01:58:35.103]  Make copies of it.
[01:58:35.103 --> 01:58:36.284]  Get it out to folks.
[01:58:36.284 --> 01:58:39.827]  This is the fight of our lives and we have the tools to expose the criminals.
[01:58:39.827 --> 01:58:44.330]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.583 --> 01:58:51.046]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.046 --> 01:58:52.747]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.747 --> 01:58:57.490]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.490 --> 01:59:00.452]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.452 --> 01:59:03.493]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.493 --> 01:59:08.216]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.436 --> 01:59:09.557]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.557 --> 01:59:12.800]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:19.806]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.806 --> 01:59:23.069]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:24.751]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:59:28.214 --> 01:59:34.477]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:34.477 --> 01:59:38.239]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.239 --> 01:59:39.599]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:39.599 --> 01:59:40.220]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:42.041]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.914 --> 01:59:56.315]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.315 --> 02:00:05.581]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.581 --> 02:00:06.881]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.881 --> 02:00:08.662]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.662 --> 02:00:10.423]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.423 --> 02:00:12.004]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:12.945]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.945 --> 02:00:17.748]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.748 --> 02:00:21.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.041]  Alright, for this segment, we'll go to the next.
[02:00:26.041 --> 02:00:31.526]  I have Bob Chapman and Jason Burmiss in studio with us today, talking about all these attempts to debunk us.
[02:00:31.526 --> 02:00:33.147]  I mean, how obvious is it?
[02:00:33.147 --> 02:00:38.912]  Baku Singh put Ron Paul supporters in jail a year ago, where dangerous used the military on us, MYAC reports stuff.
[02:00:38.912 --> 02:00:52.002]  I'm your friend, I've decided I like you, I'm gonna be the great arbiter, I will decide, we'll start a grassroots movement under me, which is what Obama and the British government, they're all creating these doppelgangers, to kind of go out and imitate what we do, but then stab everybody in the back.
[02:00:52.002 --> 02:00:53.824]  Bob Chapman, how obvious is this to you?
[02:00:55.091 --> 02:00:57.332]  It's very obvious and it has been from the beginning.
[02:00:57.332 --> 02:01:09.435]  We used to call these people change agents and what they do is they work for the people who control things from behind government and they're told what to do and how to do it.
[02:01:09.435 --> 02:01:18.297]  And they have experts working all around the world 24 hours a day coming up with things like this among other things that they do.
[02:01:18.297 --> 02:01:20.297]  And so that's what he is.
[02:01:20.297 --> 02:01:22.738]  He's a disinformation specialist.
[02:01:23.596 --> 02:01:27.557]  And they have the grain of truth, and then they have the rest of it being propaganda.
[02:01:27.557 --> 02:01:29.158]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:01:29.158 --> 02:01:31.438]  What he said is wrong.
[02:01:31.438 --> 02:01:34.199]  And the interview he had was ludicrous.
[02:01:34.199 --> 02:01:37.920]  I mean, the other man had nothing to say.
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:39.381]  Barnes, tell us about Megs.
[02:01:39.381 --> 02:01:40.701]  This is a true piece of work.
[02:01:44.477 --> 02:02:00.460]  Yeah, Megs is the former editor-in-chief over at Entertainment Weekly, a magazine I used to read a lot as a kid, and he was hired by Hearst Publications, I believe, in the run-up to that big article that they wrote about the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.720]  This was back in, I believe, 2004.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:08.762]  They did a big cleaning of all their employees and brought in a whole bunch of new people.
[02:02:08.762 --> 02:02:09.462]  Now, Megs
[02:02:10.422 --> 02:02:12.744]  And I debated about 9-11.
[02:02:12.744 --> 02:02:15.447]  I ate him and David Dunbar up.
[02:02:15.447 --> 02:02:17.809]  They had the opportunity to debate me again on The View.
[02:02:17.809 --> 02:02:19.410]  They refused to do so.
[02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:23.293]  Then they stopped taking requests altogether to debate 9-11.
[02:02:23.293 --> 02:02:33.122]  And for them to bring in popular mechanics to try to quote-unquote debunk the FEMA camps is just about as thinly veiled as it gets.
[02:02:33.122 --> 02:02:37.046]  This is a magazine that's supposed to go over the latest tractor, the latest car.
[02:02:37.906 --> 02:02:41.389]  I mean, it has nothing to do with FEMA camps, Alex, or 9-11.
[02:02:41.389 --> 02:02:42.389]  But it's worse than that.
[02:02:42.389 --> 02:02:48.333]  The next thing Beck goes to, we've gotten more of the clip, is he goes, now we're going to debunk compulsory service.
[02:02:48.333 --> 02:02:49.934]  It was in all the bills.
[02:02:49.934 --> 02:02:51.696]  Obama's announcing they're trying to push it.
[02:02:51.696 --> 02:02:53.257]  We're trying to shoot it down.
[02:02:53.257 --> 02:02:54.477]  People denied it was in the bills.
[02:02:54.477 --> 02:02:56.279]  It's like they denied the MAIAC report.
[02:02:56.279 --> 02:02:57.900]  Now they won't issue the full bill.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:58.940]  We don't know.
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:02:59.681]  We can't find it.
[02:02:59.841 --> 02:03:03.604]  See, they make it extremely difficult for me to do a keyword search.
[02:03:03.604 --> 02:03:08.187]  By providing me with a PDF file, I can just type in a word and I can scan the entire document.
[02:03:08.187 --> 02:03:11.710]  What they have up there is text of legislation, and each subsection has a link.
[02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:16.993]  So I literally have to go through 200 plus subsections, each one, and type in that keyword.
[02:03:16.993 --> 02:03:19.095]  So they're making it very difficult to scan the file.
[02:03:19.095 --> 02:03:20.776]  Yeah, but they don't even have the full copy of the new version.
[02:03:20.816 --> 02:03:23.439]  They do have the full copy, but it's only in text subsections.
[02:03:23.439 --> 02:03:26.743]  So I can click on a link, it'll give me a subsection like this one, Alex.
[02:03:26.743 --> 02:03:28.145]  It'll give me like four sections.
[02:03:28.145 --> 02:03:30.167]  But then you gotta click on the next link, and the next link.
[02:03:30.167 --> 02:03:32.811]  And on the side, it's supposed to provide you with a PDF.
[02:03:32.811 --> 02:03:34.793]  You can get PDFs of the earlier versions.
[02:03:34.793 --> 02:03:36.235]  But again, this is the fifth version of the bill.
[02:03:36.235 --> 02:03:37.817]  You know, I had a caller on my show last night.
[02:03:38.197 --> 02:03:39.538]  Well, they've been doing that for a long time.
[02:03:39.538 --> 02:03:41.599]  And it's just the public is not aware of it.
[02:03:41.599 --> 02:03:45.321]  And, you know, these bills, whether it's a labor union that's written the legislation,
[02:04:08.519 --> 02:04:12.868]  Or a lobbying group for the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:04:12.868 --> 02:04:18.218]  Very little work is done on bills of any kind by Congress themselves.
[02:04:18.218 --> 02:04:20.323]  It's these other parties who bring in
[02:04:21.024 --> 02:04:23.825]  The legislative wording and the writing.
[02:04:23.825 --> 02:04:32.329]  But how asinine is it for them to try to say we're making it up that they want a compulsory service and are trying to pass that when it's all over the news?
[02:04:32.329 --> 02:04:34.770]  I mean, they think they can get away with anything.
[02:04:34.770 --> 02:04:44.294]  I mean, right now, no one's still talking about the effectiveness of a centralized electronic citizen verification system that they're going to put into place through the Department of Education and our children, Alex.
[02:04:44.574 --> 02:04:47.280]  Yeah, let's talk about that and get Bob Chapman's final take on that.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.163]  His website is TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:04:49.163 --> 02:04:50.145]  It's invaluable.
[02:04:50.145 --> 02:04:55.796]  You can go there and get a free electronic copy of it, or you can call toll-free number we'll give you and get a hard copy of it.
[02:04:55.796 --> 02:04:56.177]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.767 --> 02:05:02.908]  Spring is here.
[02:05:02.908 --> 02:05:03.848]  Growing season.
[02:05:03.848 --> 02:05:06.050]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:07.771]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:05:07.771 --> 02:05:08.752]  Think about it.
[02:05:08.752 --> 02:05:12.835]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:05:12.835 --> 02:05:16.577]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:05:16.577 --> 02:05:18.478]  The country is running out of food.
[02:05:18.478 --> 02:05:21.320]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:28.225]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs,
[02:05:28.505 --> 02:05:33.490]  As well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:05:33.490 --> 02:05:40.476]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[02:05:40.476 --> 02:05:47.342]  With detailed growing guides available to you at no charge, you can maximize your harvest and investment.
[02:05:47.342 --> 02:05:48.463]  And the best part?
[02:05:48.463 --> 02:05:50.805]  All orders ship within 24 hours.
[02:05:50.805 --> 02:05:53.347]  So head over to OrganicaSeed.com
[02:05:53.647 --> 02:05:58.214]  That's O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A-C-E-D dot com.
[02:05:58.214 --> 02:05:59.997]  OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:05:59.997 --> 02:06:00.438]  Today.
[02:06:00.438 --> 02:06:07.149]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.922 --> 02:06:13.806]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.806 --> 02:06:20.310]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:22.271]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.271 --> 02:06:24.732]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.732 --> 02:06:35.619]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.913 --> 02:06:39.574]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.574 --> 02:06:41.455]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.455 --> 02:06:48.360]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:56.625]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.625 --> 02:06:58.186]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.186 --> 02:06:59.367]  The people strike back.
[02:07:00.936 --> 02:07:06.320]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:14.888]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:07:14.888 --> 02:07:18.470]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:21.693]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?

[02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:20.691]  Finishing up with Bob Chapman and Jason Bermas with some key news inside legislation.
[02:08:21.511 --> 02:08:28.455]  And this is just, uh, this particular piece we're looking at, the subsections we're finding to set up a whole nother Real ID Act for the public schools.
[02:08:28.455 --> 02:08:30.197]  So that's coming up in one moment.

[02:08:49.568 --> 02:08:50.989]  He's very wicked, of course.
[02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:53.631]  They may put him in the MIAC report or something.
[02:08:53.631 --> 02:08:59.775]  But seriously, folks, let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:04.281]  We just love him.
[02:10:04.841 --> 02:10:06.062]  Okay.
[02:10:06.062 --> 02:10:11.507]  Now, in the few minutes we have left with Bob Chapman, give them the subsection of the bill.
[02:10:11.507 --> 02:10:14.289]  This is the type of stuff they have tucked into this national service bill.
[02:10:14.289 --> 02:10:15.950]  We're trying to get pulled out of it.
[02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:16.991]  But this is some of the other stuff.
[02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:20.234]  Now imagine how big the national ID card is they denied so long they were setting up.
[02:10:20.734 --> 02:10:29.761]  With federal highway funds tied to the states, thumb prints, biometrically face scans, being integrated into federal and private databases, being used as this global system.
[02:10:29.761 --> 02:10:30.961]  And the states are resisting that.
[02:10:30.961 --> 02:10:33.764]  Well, imagine what's in all the thousands of pieces of legislation.
[02:10:33.764 --> 02:10:40.669]  We're just reading the one dealing with National Compulsory Service and find other little gems like this that nobody's talking about.
[02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:44.711]  We gotta get a story from Paul Watson or from Kurt Nemo on this ASAP.
[02:10:44.711 --> 02:10:45.252]  Tell them about it.
[02:10:47.671 --> 02:10:55.239]  Section 1710, study to evaluate the effectiveness of a centralized electronic citizenship verification system.
[02:10:55.239 --> 02:11:09.393]  The Corporation for National and Community Service shall conduct a study to determine the effectiveness of a centralized electronic citizenship verification system which would allow the Corporation to share employment eligibility information with the Department of Education.
[02:11:10.094 --> 02:11:24.464]  Now they're going to implement this through both the corporation and the Department of Education in subsection A1, but in subsection A4 they let you know that the information that needs to be shared in order to fulfill employment eligibility requirements.
[02:11:24.464 --> 02:11:32.370]  So basically they're telling you if you don't go along with this system you will not be able to be employed in this country and they're going to implement it and it's fully funded from 2010 to 2014.
[02:11:34.531 --> 02:11:36.232]  That's what Homeland Security's been saying.
[02:11:36.232 --> 02:11:41.014]  You'll have to have an ID card to buy and sell to have a job, but the illegal aliens are exempt from this.
[02:11:41.014 --> 02:11:52.420]  Like in the $787 million stimulus package, it says illegals are exempt from having to go through ID requirements, but citizens have to to get the money or to be involved in any of the bailouts.
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:53.860]  So just absolutely amazing.
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:57.422]  Bob Chapman, give us your analysis on this.
[02:11:57.422 --> 02:12:02.444]  Well, first of all, it's more insanity, particularly the illegal alien aspect of it.
[02:12:02.444 --> 02:12:03.805]  It flies in the face of
[02:12:04.561 --> 02:12:06.883]  Any kind of logic whatsoever.
[02:12:06.883 --> 02:12:13.447]  But these sorts of things, as we know, have been coming for a long time, and now they're approaching reality.
[02:12:13.447 --> 02:12:33.600]  That is, the identification card via Homeland Security, via driver's licenses, and now this new element, which is the data bank of children, so that when they reach
[02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:39.554]  Uh, an age that they are going to be employed, uh, that will be just carried on.
[02:12:39.554 --> 02:12:44.675]  And as you said, you won't be able to get a job unless you're in this data bank.
[02:12:44.675 --> 02:12:54.178]  And so what they're doing is pigeon pigeonholing everybody so that, uh, they know what everybody can do, uh, how they've been trained.
[02:12:54.178 --> 02:13:00.019]  And so if government says, uh, Mr. Smith, um, you live in New York City.
[02:13:00.818 --> 02:13:11.677]  Uh, but, uh, we don't see any jobs for you there, so, uh, we do have some jobs for you in Provo, Utah, so, uh, we're gonna ship you out there, otherwise you don't work.
[02:13:13.066 --> 02:13:24.135]  Well absolutely, and under this, it's still in there to make, I mean it's got the 18 to 25, three months compulsory service, that it appears has been stripped for now, thank God, people getting upset, but it was in the bills.
[02:13:24.135 --> 02:13:39.767]  And in mainstream news, they still say 50 hours for middle school, 100 hours for elementary, compulsory service for college, so this is federal control, and so it says the kids going to school have to have this, and that's what they've been saying
[02:13:40.407 --> 02:13:41.108]  In there.
[02:13:41.108 --> 02:13:41.728]  Currently in there.
[02:13:41.728 --> 02:13:41.808]  Yes.
[02:14:03.068 --> 02:14:03.888]  And that's what we're doing.
[02:14:03.888 --> 02:14:05.289]  I mean, this bill's changing every day.
[02:14:05.289 --> 02:14:06.489]  We spent hours trying to read it.
[02:14:06.489 --> 02:14:07.809]  Burmese is.
[02:14:07.809 --> 02:14:08.910]  The Watson Brothers are.
[02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:09.430]  Nemo is.
[02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:11.130]  And this is one bill.
[02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:12.830]  Congress has no way of keeping track of this.
[02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:14.411]  We can't keep track of this.
[02:14:14.411 --> 02:14:21.092]  That's why they've tried to pass the Read the Bills Act, whereby law, the congressmen have to read the bills and be involved in writing them.
[02:14:21.092 --> 02:14:23.233]  But there's other subsections, too, in here, aren't there?
[02:14:23.373 --> 02:14:34.138]  Yeah, there are a ton of subsections, and you know the subsection right under 1801 is this call to service campaign on September 11th, literally hijacking 9-11 as Obama's new holiday.
[02:14:34.138 --> 02:14:47.985]  And they're actually going to be funding all these different observations around the country, so they're going to have their national campaign for service, and then they're going to put out, you know, their people on 9-11, and they're going to go door-to-door on 9-11 and try to recruit others.
[02:14:47.985 --> 02:14:52.447]  That's what, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, they're going after
[02:14:53.187 --> 02:14:54.027]  Everybody here.
[02:14:54.027 --> 02:14:57.248]  And they're going to say, join us, you're not for the 9-11 attacks, are you now?
[02:14:57.248 --> 02:15:15.835]  Hundreds of schools have announced, this is all over the news every day, I see four or five articles, where the schools are saying you have to do compulsory service even without the federal law yet, and they're calling it the new Obama curriculum, and here's one today, Oakland School renamed Barack Obama Academy, and they're suddenly turning lots of public schools into full-bore military academies.
[02:15:15.835 --> 02:15:18.036]  Bob Chapman.
[02:15:18.036 --> 02:15:21.797]  Well, I hadn't heard that, but that's not such a good idea, because that's where
[02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:31.136]  The type of Hitler Junga comes from and the brown shirts and other fascist or communist appendages of government.
[02:15:31.136 --> 02:15:33.057]  And that's where they're headed with that.
[02:15:33.057 --> 02:15:48.207]  And with the codification and data on individual children as they grow up, what'll come later, once they have everybody DNA'd,
[02:15:48.955 --> 02:15:50.636]  Uh, is selective breeding.
[02:15:50.636 --> 02:15:52.457]  And who can, who can't, who are you going to marry?
[02:15:52.457 --> 02:15:57.859]  Oh, by the way, they've now announced, now they've announced the Associated Press, I told people 14 years ago.
[02:15:57.859 --> 02:16:02.461]  Everybody at birth for 36 years has had their blood taken and put in a federal DNA database, and guess what?
[02:16:02.461 --> 02:16:06.463]  Europe's done it, England's done it, Canada's done it, Australia's done it, and it all started the same year.
[02:16:07.043 --> 02:16:08.264]  That is global management.
[02:16:08.264 --> 02:16:10.406]  That is the strings of the spider web.
[02:16:10.406 --> 02:16:11.948]  People only look at a piece of the web.
[02:16:11.948 --> 02:16:15.591]  Look at the big fat spider, the New World Order, sitting right in the middle of that thing.
[02:16:15.591 --> 02:16:20.376]  Bob Chapman, you'll be back with us for an hour graciously next Friday from noon to 1 p.m.
[02:16:20.376 --> 02:16:21.237]  You stayed over today.
[02:16:21.237 --> 02:16:23.679]  I appreciate you being here with us.
[02:16:23.679 --> 02:16:25.420]  Folks can go to TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:16:27.022 --> 02:16:27.442]  877-479-8178.
[02:16:27.442 --> 02:16:27.783]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:16:27.783 --> 02:16:29.364]  And I'll see you next week.
[02:16:54.451 --> 02:16:55.332]  Thank you so much, Bob.
[02:16:55.332 --> 02:16:57.454]  I appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:16:57.454 --> 02:16:58.755]  And I want to be clear here.
[02:16:58.755 --> 02:17:12.309]  There is so much legislation that listeners are warning us about that I'm trying to read, where I'll have like 50 bills sent to me a day, and I'm trying to read the sections, and I find horrible stuff, and then forget about it, and then move on to something else, and it's just hitting us.
[02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:18.073]  Congress approves a landmark conservation bill, you know, grabbing two million more acres.
[02:17:18.073 --> 02:17:19.033]  It's more than that.
[02:17:19.033 --> 02:17:21.094]  It's actually 40 million acres.
[02:17:21.094 --> 02:17:24.676]  There's 26 in there, and that has 160 bills amalgamated into it.
[02:17:24.676 --> 02:17:28.338]  They don't tell you the name of the bill, because I tried to look it up to see what these things said.
[02:17:28.338 --> 02:17:30.619]  It's a giant land grab, and God knows what.
[02:17:30.619 --> 02:17:34.541]  We've been covering this for two weeks, but the issue is 2 million here, 8 million there, 160 bills.
[02:17:34.541 --> 02:17:34.861]  Yeah, this is...
[02:17:37.282 --> 02:17:39.343]  This report here is out of Reuters.
[02:17:39.343 --> 02:17:45.646]  It says, The measure, a package of more than 160 bills, would set aside 2 million acres, parks, river streams, desert, forest, and trails.
[02:17:45.646 --> 02:17:47.507]  So when they set aside a river, that's a corridor.
[02:17:47.507 --> 02:17:50.749]  Then they grab your property, or won't let you use it on either side.
[02:17:50.749 --> 02:17:55.111]  And nine states and new wilderness and render them off limits to oil and gas drilling and other development.
[02:17:55.111 --> 02:17:59.734]  The House of Representatives approved the measure on vote 285 to 140, and it goes on.
[02:17:59.734 --> 02:18:05.717]  Now understand, folks, there are some western states where over 90% of it is under federal or state control.
[02:18:06.397 --> 02:18:16.021]  Okay, the Westerns, I mean, it is a joke, and they're harassing the few little areas of privately held land, and then years after they steal it, they then give it to elite companies for strip mining.
[02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:18.061]  Has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:18:18.061 --> 02:18:21.022]  They got Robert Redford and everybody else out pitching that.
[02:18:21.022 --> 02:18:22.163]  Jason Burmas, thanks for coming in.
[02:18:22.623 --> 02:18:27.667]  And you'll be on live tonight, 9 to midnight, right in the studio, simulcast at Genesis and at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:27.667 --> 02:18:35.252]  We've got an amazing guest coming up after this quick break, Dr. Whitaker, so stay with us on that and his book Medicine.
[02:18:35.252 --> 02:18:36.893]  He'll be with us basically for the rest of the show.
[02:18:36.893 --> 02:18:42.777]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour for a full hour of questions for this great mind who's done a lot of research and is an author.
[02:18:43.838 --> 02:18:46.982]  Before I end this segment, the Obama deception, folks.
[02:18:46.982 --> 02:18:48.924]  This guy's owned by the New World Order.
[02:18:48.924 --> 02:18:50.106]  He is deceiving people.
[02:18:50.106 --> 02:18:51.808]  We exposed Bush as a puppet.
[02:18:51.808 --> 02:18:53.149]  We're exposing Obama as a puppet.
[02:18:53.149 --> 02:18:57.454]  It explains how he's a front man, as Henry Kissinger says, to bring in world government.
[02:18:57.454 --> 02:18:58.175]  Total tyranny.
[02:18:59.476 --> 02:19:04.921]  Funded the eugenics funding for Africa and Latin America and Asia, the forced abortions, the sterilization.
[02:19:04.921 --> 02:19:06.743]  We get into that in the film.
[02:19:06.743 --> 02:19:08.364]  This guy is a Judas goat.
[02:19:08.364 --> 02:19:16.551]  As KRS-One, rap icon, says in the film, the New World Order was falling, the world was on the edge of revolution, so they put a black face on the New World Order.
[02:19:16.551 --> 02:19:19.733]  That is what this exposes and it shows what the bankers are really doing.
[02:19:19.733 --> 02:19:23.517]  So go to InfoWars.com and get the Obama Deception on DVD.
[02:19:23.517 --> 02:19:24.838]  They're shipping out now.

[02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:33.203]  The DNC Denver 2008, where they attack us with a knife and cut up my microphone.
[02:19:33.203 --> 02:19:34.404]  Extended interviews.
[02:19:34.404 --> 02:19:35.404]  An amazing film.

[02:19:56.018 --> 02:19:59.834]  There's a viewer's guide where everything's documented at obamadeception.net.
[02:19:59.834 --> 02:20:00.336]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.094 --> 02:20:07.595]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:20:07.595 --> 02:20:08.395]  and the world.
[02:20:08.395 --> 02:20:12.256]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:20:12.256 --> 02:20:18.757]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:20:18.757 --> 02:20:20.777]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:20:20.777 --> 02:20:28.719]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:20:28.999 --> 02:20:33.701]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:20:33.701 --> 02:20:39.524]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:20:39.524 --> 02:20:41.685]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:20:41.685 --> 02:20:43.946]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:20:44.286 --> 02:20:45.366]  Free of charge.
[02:20:45.366 --> 02:20:45.706]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.

[02:20:48.107 --> 02:20:50.768]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.

[02:20:51.628 --> 02:20:53.549]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[02:21:04.659 --> 02:21:07.284]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.284 --> 02:21:14.297]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:21.455]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.455 --> 02:21:23.437]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.437 --> 02:21:25.939]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:25.939 --> 02:21:36.888]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.506 --> 02:21:39.167]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.167 --> 02:21:41.028]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.028 --> 02:21:47.953]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:47.953 --> 02:21:56.218]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.218 --> 02:21:57.779]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:57.779 --> 02:22:01.601]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.601 --> 02:22:04.022]  Peter Kranschnabel here from Midas Resources.
[02:22:04.022 --> 02:22:06.424]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[02:22:07.037 --> 02:22:09.498]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[02:22:09.498 --> 02:22:11.918]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[02:22:11.918 --> 02:22:14.399]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[02:22:14.399 --> 02:22:17.260]  Scandal after scandal with hedge fund companies?
[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:22.661]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[02:22:22.661 --> 02:22:25.722]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[02:22:25.722 --> 02:22:33.944]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[02:22:34.651 --> 02:22:38.215]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:38.215 --> 02:22:40.677]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:40.677 --> 02:22:41.758]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:41.758 --> 02:22:44.081]  While you can still purchase gold with paper, that is 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:23:01.823 --> 02:23:07.345]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[02:23:07.345 --> 02:23:10.346]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[02:23:10.346 --> 02:23:15.968]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[02:23:15.968 --> 02:23:20.229]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[02:23:20.229 --> 02:23:21.510]  We have been warned.
[02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:27.652]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[02:23:28.482 --> 02:23:31.704]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[02:23:31.704 --> 02:23:32.144]  Why?
[02:23:32.144 --> 02:23:36.146]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[02:23:36.146 --> 02:23:37.707]  Supplies are running low.
[02:23:37.707 --> 02:23:44.211]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[02:23:44.211 --> 02:23:48.113]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[02:23:48.113 --> 02:23:50.575]  Go to yourfoodstorage.com.
[02:23:50.575 --> 02:23:52.376]  That's yourfoodstorage.com.
[02:23:52.376 --> 02:23:53.116]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[02:23:56.058 --> 02:24:08.081]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[02:24:08.081 --> 02:24:17.243]  So much going on.
[02:24:17.243 --> 02:24:22.845]  Dr. Scott Whitaker is a board-certified naturopathic doctor with over 20 years of experience.
[02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:25.522]  Southern California native.
[02:24:25.522 --> 02:24:28.923]  He grew up in the infamous South Central area of Los Angeles.
[02:24:28.923 --> 02:24:30.824]  Strong parental guidance as his anchor.
[02:24:30.824 --> 02:24:36.385]  He escaped the call of the streets and received his undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley in civil engineering.
[02:24:36.385 --> 02:24:41.607]  During his time at Berkeley, he became interested in holistic medicine and drew a connection between holistic living and long-term health.
[02:24:42.682 --> 02:24:54.529]  Particular interest to him was the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of prescription drugs on common health problems, plugging the African-American community especially alarming was the number of friends and family members he watched suffer and eventually die from effects of these synthetic
[02:24:55.925 --> 02:24:57.006]  Slaughterhouses.
[02:24:57.006 --> 02:25:00.628]  And after graduation, he found himself working in the engineering field at St.
[02:25:00.628 --> 02:25:01.229]  Louis, Missouri.
[02:25:01.229 --> 02:25:05.952]  He enrolled in Keller Graduate School of Management, where he earned his MBA and his interest in holistic medicine.
[02:25:05.952 --> 02:25:08.673]  Was far from satisfied at Furman to get all the information he could.
[02:25:08.673 --> 02:25:16.218]  He obtained a doctorate of naturopathy from the International School of Naturopathy in Los Altos, California.
[02:25:16.218 --> 02:25:24.384]  And armed with the resources he needed, Dr. Whitaker vowed to spread the truth about prescription medications and bring the message of holistic lifestyles and the means of obtaining long-term good health
[02:25:24.904 --> 02:25:25.245]  We're good to go.
[02:25:42.627 --> 02:25:44.789]  I mean, this is on record.
[02:25:44.789 --> 02:25:45.529]  Take Prozac.
[02:25:45.529 --> 02:25:48.131]  They admit it causes you to go psychopathic and get more depressed.
[02:25:48.131 --> 02:25:50.692]  It's on the insert, so they put you on more drugs.
[02:25:50.692 --> 02:25:54.194]  I'm just backing him up before we go to him.
[02:25:54.194 --> 02:25:55.715]  And then they found in all these studies that St.
[02:25:55.715 --> 02:25:59.437]  John's wort, in double-blind studies, actually helps people.
[02:25:59.437 --> 02:26:03.900]  But then Prozac, actually, in the whole group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, actually hurts them.
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:05.041]  I told you the Alabama and
[02:26:06.761 --> 02:26:09.222]  Germany shooters, three weeks ago, were going to be on it.
[02:26:09.222 --> 02:26:09.842]  They were on it.
[02:26:09.842 --> 02:26:11.342]  Came out in the news later.
[02:26:11.342 --> 02:26:12.903]  Came out in AP and other places.
[02:26:12.903 --> 02:26:14.824]  So, it's a scourge.
[02:26:14.824 --> 02:26:20.785]  And then they're talking about putting statins in the water, like they self-medicate us, force-medicate us, with the sodium fluoride.
[02:26:20.785 --> 02:26:23.686]  That's on mainstream news, MSNBC.
[02:26:23.686 --> 02:26:26.327]  I mean, they're trying to force vaccines on us, all of us.
[02:26:26.327 --> 02:26:30.828]  So he's with us for the full rest of the show, the next hour and 35 minutes.
[02:26:30.828 --> 02:26:34.350]  And I appreciate him coming on the show today.
[02:26:34.350 --> 02:26:35.650]  Dr. Whitaker, thanks for being on.
[02:26:36.742 --> 02:26:39.343]  Good to have you here.
[02:26:39.343 --> 02:26:40.203]  This is a short segment.
[02:26:40.203 --> 02:26:45.985]  Just introduce yourself, your awakening, and then let's get into all the research you've done and what you've found.
[02:26:45.985 --> 02:27:02.611]  Dr. Whitaker, 20 years of experience in holistic medicine, nutritional detoxification, been traveling the world, been to about nine countries, studying those healing sciences over in Africa and Asia, bringing them back to America and using them and applying them.
[02:27:03.211 --> 02:27:10.433]  And getting phenomenal results with everyone I come in contact with regarding their particular condition.
[02:27:10.433 --> 02:27:17.074]  So the holistic approach to healing is the only way I go.
[02:27:17.074 --> 02:27:23.296]  The current medical establishment, the current medical paradigm is nothing but a death trap.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:32.602]  Well, I agree with you, and it's set up by the eugenicists, and the doctors and nurses are compartmentalized.
[02:27:32.602 --> 02:27:41.384]  Tell us about your awakening, and then we're going to come back and get into the research you go over in your book, Medicine, exposing what they're doing.
[02:27:41.384 --> 02:27:55.809]  I guess my awakening actually started when I was a young guy, and my dad was always sending me off to school with my herbs and minerals and vitamins, and I never missed a day of school in terms of attendance.
[02:27:55.809 --> 02:27:56.569]  I never was sick.
[02:27:57.396 --> 02:28:00.258]  And I was always fascinated with chemistry.
[02:28:00.258 --> 02:28:12.246]  And as I went higher in education and took chemistry classes and organic chem and all that stuff, and really saw the connection of how plants relate to the body and how the body relates to plants.
[02:28:12.246 --> 02:28:15.508]  And I met a Seminole Indian on campus one day there at Berkeley.
[02:28:15.508 --> 02:28:20.831]  He told me to never take any drug and always use the plants for healing.
[02:28:20.831 --> 02:28:22.913]  And I used Goldenseal and Echinacea.
[02:28:22.913 --> 02:28:26.075]  From that day on, I went from one book to over 800 books.
[02:28:27.228 --> 02:28:29.550]  In terms of nutritional healing.
[02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:40.660]  And then I had a personal experience with someone very close to me who went to see a doctor on a Tuesday and they admitted her and she was dead by Thursday.
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:48.267]  And from then on I said that I would expose these criminals for who they are and to wake people up.
[02:28:48.267 --> 02:28:49.027]  Well, that's right.
[02:28:49.027 --> 02:28:52.250]  In fact, we see in the national news every year the number, it's always above 300,000.
[02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.671]  This is admitted.
[02:28:54.693 --> 02:28:57.894]  That die of bad drug interactions alone.
[02:28:57.894 --> 02:29:06.858]  I've had one surgery when I broke my leg and at night the IV came out and I woke up with blood all over me.
[02:29:06.858 --> 02:29:09.979]  I've had so many friends that go in to have a surgery, they get an infection and die.
[02:29:09.979 --> 02:29:11.340]  I've had good friends that have died of that.
[02:29:12.541 --> 02:29:20.690]  I mean, they go in for a migraine headache and they're dead two days later from the needle they put on them.
[02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:23.634]  But still, the general public isn't aware of this.
[02:29:23.634 --> 02:29:24.314]  It's just incredible.
[02:29:24.314 --> 02:29:25.015]  So stay there, sir.
[02:29:25.015 --> 02:29:30.201]  Let's break it down, because you go through it in the book with the author of Medicine.
[02:29:31.042 --> 02:29:39.106]  And he's an engineer, he's a doctor, he's a lot of other things, and he brings all those different forms of research together just with amazing information.
[02:29:39.106 --> 02:29:44.108]  The website is medicine.ownspot.com.
[02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:47.830]  We'll put that up on screen for everybody watching at prisonplanet.tv as well.
[02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:49.851]  Dr. Scott Whitaker is our guest.
[02:29:49.851 --> 02:29:51.692]  This is the Info War.
[02:29:51.692 --> 02:29:53.072]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.072 --> 02:29:55.614]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.614 --> 02:29:58.315]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.139 --> 02:30:07.365]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:30:08.161 --> 02:30:14.045]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:30:14.045 --> 02:30:20.529]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:30:20.529 --> 02:30:22.510]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:30:22.510 --> 02:30:24.991]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:30:24.991 --> 02:30:35.878]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:30:38.149 --> 02:30:39.830]  It's not about left or right.
[02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:41.690]  It's about a one world government.
[02:30:41.690 --> 02:30:48.593]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:30:56.856 --> 02:30:58.436]  The Obama Deception.

[02:31:01.164 --> 02:31:02.866]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:31:02.866 --> 02:31:04.607]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:31:04.607 --> 02:31:07.290]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:31:07.290 --> 02:31:12.435]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:31:12.435 --> 02:31:15.638]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:33:14.498 --> 02:33:16.599]  I look at my children.
[02:33:16.599 --> 02:33:20.962]  I look at all the other innocent people I know.
[02:33:20.962 --> 02:33:23.463]  I talk to medical doctors.
[02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:40.623]  We've got all the Rockefeller documents.
[02:33:40.623 --> 02:33:41.243]  I've seen them.
[02:33:41.243 --> 02:33:47.752]  We've covered them here a hundred times where they knowingly discovered that most cancer was viral 85 years ago or so.
[02:33:47.752 --> 02:33:49.614]  It's put in the vaccines.
[02:33:49.614 --> 02:33:51.517]  That childhood cancer was unknown.
[02:33:51.517 --> 02:33:52.959]  Now it's epidemic worldwide.
[02:33:55.452 --> 02:34:06.500]  I'm going to go over this report later with Dr. Whitaker, who's on with us, out of the Associated Press, demonizing people that aren't taking vaccines, but saying worldwide in some countries, like Africa, the whole public won't take them.
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:09.462]  They have to pay local government to come at gunpoint and give it to them.
[02:34:09.462 --> 02:34:12.084]  Half the public in Ukraine is now refusing exponentially.
[02:34:12.084 --> 02:34:14.245]  It's happening everywhere, so people are waking up.
[02:34:14.245 --> 02:34:23.311]  But going back just to what Dr. Whitaker covers in his book, and by the way, you can go to www.medicine.net, also his other website, and find out more.
[02:34:24.562 --> 02:34:29.525]  It's just so horrible what they're doing, and most of the doctors and nurses, they don't even know, they're compartmentalized.
[02:34:29.525 --> 02:34:38.350]  So sir, please continue, break it all down, the numbers, what we're facing, what's really going on in the hospitals, the carnage.
[02:34:38.350 --> 02:34:44.033]  Yes, well the hospitals are, I want everybody to realize this, the hospitals are a business.
[02:34:44.033 --> 02:34:46.414]  Don't ever forget that.
[02:34:46.414 --> 02:34:50.477]  If you don't believe me, go in there without your insurance card.
[02:34:50.477 --> 02:34:52.238]  But the hospitals are set up, they're all
[02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:56.733]  I don't care how many foundations that they put on the TV
[02:35:22.890 --> 02:35:26.652]  I don't care how many pink ribbons you see every October.
[02:35:26.652 --> 02:35:31.513]  There is no cure ever coming from the medical establishment because they don't want a cure.
[02:35:31.513 --> 02:35:40.517]  The goal is to keep you at least about halfway sick and halfway alive so they can drain your account and then send you off to your grave.
[02:35:43.271 --> 02:35:45.692]  You're right, and they're suppressing a lot of cures.
[02:35:45.692 --> 02:35:47.133]  That's been documented.
[02:35:47.133 --> 02:35:47.974]  Please continue.
[02:35:47.974 --> 02:35:57.659]  I mean, the numbers of people dying from malpractice, admittedly dying from bad drug interactions, but just the drugs themselves, you know, FinFin, the heart attacks, it's all admitted.
[02:35:57.659 --> 02:35:59.800]  It's like HPV vaccines killing all these people.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:00.421]  They admit it is.
[02:36:00.421 --> 02:36:01.601]  They say, that's okay.
[02:36:01.601 --> 02:36:03.042]  People are going to die.
[02:36:03.042 --> 02:36:03.442]  No doubt.
[02:36:03.442 --> 02:36:13.008]  And that corporation, Merck, probably one of the most sinister corporations on the planet, who came out with, who gave us Vioxx a couple years back,
[02:36:13.467 --> 02:36:15.689]  Killed over 50,000 people.
[02:36:15.689 --> 02:36:23.435]  And then they decided, oh, you know, we made a little mistake and then pulled it off the shelf, but they had made $3.3 billion.
[02:36:23.435 --> 02:36:34.423]  So then they want to come out and give this garter seal to our little girls ages of nine and 26, which I believe is nothing but a sterilization program.
[02:36:34.423 --> 02:36:38.747]  And, uh, it's the body naturally gets rid of the so-called HPV.
[02:36:40.226 --> 02:36:46.352]  And it only kills 3,000 people a year and that's folks that already have autoimmune problems.
[02:36:46.352 --> 02:37:00.765]  It's a virus that's on doorknobs everywhere else and they admit on the insert, I mean I don't have to go to a doctor to know this, they admit on the insert we're not even sure this knocks out the HPV and only covers four to six of the 350 plus varieties of it.
[02:37:00.765 --> 02:37:04.408]  Yes, yes, even the so-called FDA of all people
[02:37:05.129 --> 02:37:08.832]  Admit it, that your body naturally gets rid of the so-called HPV.
[02:37:08.832 --> 02:37:14.097]  I call it Hocus Pocus, because there's so many strings attached to it.
[02:37:14.097 --> 02:37:21.743]  And as I stated, actually the number one cause of cervical cancer for those women out there is latex condoms.
[02:37:21.743 --> 02:37:28.228]  So that's a whole part, a whole other show right there, Mr. Jones, but... No, no, cover it all, cover whatever you want.
[02:37:28.228 --> 02:37:29.109]  Go ahead.
[02:37:29.109 --> 02:37:33.793]  Well, latex, the latex for the condoms contains talc.
[02:37:34.719 --> 02:37:41.300]  And talc has the same or similar chemical structure as asbestos.
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:49.562]  So when you're putting something like that inside of a body and up to a delicate organ, you're going to create some serious issues there.
[02:37:49.562 --> 02:37:50.362]  And that's what that does.
[02:37:50.362 --> 02:37:57.384]  That talc gets inside of the woman and sets up the systems for the cancer to take place in the cervix.
[02:37:57.384 --> 02:38:01.005]  So men never use that on a woman.
[02:38:01.005 --> 02:38:02.425]  Women never let that in your system.
[02:38:02.927 --> 02:38:10.834]  If that is your means and methods of using, then use a non-latex condom.
[02:38:10.834 --> 02:38:11.995]  Please continue.
[02:38:11.995 --> 02:38:14.938]  Yes, the hospitals.
[02:38:14.938 --> 02:38:21.724]  One of my favorite chapters in my book, Medicine, is the hospitals, the menu.
[02:38:21.724 --> 02:38:23.645]  Who wrote the menu?
[02:38:23.645 --> 02:38:30.071]  If you ever go into a hospital and see the food that's being fed to the people, it is outright frightening.
[02:38:30.808 --> 02:38:30.928]  I'm
[02:38:50.137 --> 02:38:52.279]  No, nothing about nutrition.
[02:38:52.279 --> 02:38:54.360]  Look at Linus Pauling.
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.181]  How many times has he won the Nobel Prize?
[02:38:56.181 --> 02:39:05.929]  They know that real vitamin C, not the chemical derivative as you know, Doctor, just has magical effects on cancer and it's what your skin's made out of.
[02:39:05.929 --> 02:39:08.991]  People will get scurvy if they didn't eat it and their teeth will fall out and they die.
[02:39:08.991 --> 02:39:13.054]  And most Americans aren't getting enough vitamin C. I know you've written about that.
[02:39:13.054 --> 02:39:14.555]  Can you talk about vitamin C alone?
[02:39:15.146 --> 02:39:15.506]  Oh yeah.
[02:39:15.506 --> 02:39:22.668]  Well, vitamin C, of course, the real one, like you said, most of the vitamin C on the, in the markets, like the Walgreens and Walmart, that's all synthetic.
[02:39:22.668 --> 02:39:24.489]  That's made from synthetic corn.
[02:39:24.489 --> 02:39:31.811]  You want to get the real vitamin C, vitamin C. That's like, uh, stuff like Camu, Camu, uh, rose hips, uh, things of that sort.
[02:39:31.811 --> 02:39:34.252]  And, uh, the vitamin C is so powerful.
[02:39:34.252 --> 02:39:41.974]  Uh, as soon as the body absorbs it, uh, like you said, the skin tightens, the skin gets real elastic also.
[02:39:41.974 --> 02:39:43.995]  And then the immune system is boosted.
[02:39:45.051 --> 02:39:52.676]  Of course, it's anti-inflammatory, so vitamin C alone prevents heart attacks, so Dr. Linus Pauling did tremendous research on it.
[02:39:52.676 --> 02:40:02.061]  He was scrutinized before he died, and vitamin C needs to be used every day by everyone.
[02:40:02.061 --> 02:40:07.604]  Maybe we should just talk about the positive stuff you and others have discovered that on record works, but I mean, let's continue with the carnage.
[02:40:07.604 --> 02:40:09.385]  Let's expose them, and I'll try to shut up.
[02:40:09.385 --> 02:40:13.107]  There's so many points you bring up, I want to back you up, and then let's get into the good news, but go ahead.
[02:40:14.008 --> 02:40:21.931]  Oh, well, because I was thinking about the hospitals and basically the foods that they serve people.
[02:40:21.931 --> 02:40:33.416]  You can't get nobody well on white flour, white sugar, tap water, microwave foods, hydrogenated oils, sucralose, Splenda, canola oil.
[02:40:33.416 --> 02:40:34.997]  All this stuff is in hospital food.
[02:40:35.589 --> 02:40:38.491]  And you wonder why the people end up checking in and don't check out.
[02:40:38.491 --> 02:40:39.852]  It's almost like a roach motel.
[02:40:39.852 --> 02:40:43.974]  You know, those little things you put down next to your wall and roaches check in but don't check out.
[02:40:43.974 --> 02:40:46.175]  People are like that in hospitals.
[02:40:46.175 --> 02:40:49.477]  And the name hospital comes from the St.
[02:40:49.477 --> 02:40:50.618]  John's of the Hospitallators.
[02:40:50.618 --> 02:40:52.599]  You gotta read the research of that.
[02:40:52.599 --> 02:40:57.462]  And you know, when they killed you, back in the day, they used to lay a single rose on your pillow.
[02:40:57.462 --> 02:40:59.464]  That's where the concept of bringing roses.
[02:40:59.464 --> 02:41:05.167]  You never want to bring cut roses to someone that you're visiting who is sick because you're giving off the essence of death.
[02:41:05.871 --> 02:41:08.052]  So you always want to bring a live plant.
[02:41:08.052 --> 02:41:10.393]  But the hospitals, the M.D.
[02:41:10.393 --> 02:41:11.574]  The M.D.
[02:41:11.574 --> 02:41:13.935]  who is considered by most people as a god.
[02:41:13.935 --> 02:41:17.836]  I call them medical deities, misdirected.
[02:41:17.836 --> 02:41:19.697]  It's a priesthood.
[02:41:19.697 --> 02:41:21.258]  You better believe it's a priesthood.
[02:41:21.258 --> 02:41:25.300]  They want you to be born in their temple and die in their temple.
[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:27.301]  And their temple is the hospital.
[02:41:27.301 --> 02:41:30.402]  So the doctor's average age, M.D.'
[02:41:30.382 --> 02:41:31.543]  's average age is about 59 years.
[02:41:33.044 --> 02:41:37.305]  Okay, so just not being a doctor, you can average about 14 more years of life here in America.
[02:41:37.305 --> 02:41:39.486]  And by the way, I've got to back you up again.
[02:41:39.486 --> 02:41:42.547]  In court pleadings, you pray, it's a Roman civil court.
[02:41:42.547 --> 02:41:44.548]  He wears the black robes of Saturn.
[02:41:44.548 --> 02:41:45.508]  The judges will tell you this.
[02:41:45.508 --> 02:41:47.388]  This is even taught in law books.
[02:41:47.388 --> 02:41:49.029]  And that's all a temple as well.
[02:41:49.029 --> 02:41:51.370]  This is a cult, but medicine.
[02:41:51.370 --> 02:41:52.410]  Please continue.
[02:41:52.410 --> 02:41:53.470]  Oh yes, no doubt.
[02:41:53.470 --> 02:41:57.412]  Because all the court systems are under the British Admiralty regulations.
[02:41:57.412 --> 02:41:58.692]  Anyway, bar.
[02:41:58.692 --> 02:42:02.093]  And most of the gold, most of the flags have gold fringes.
[02:42:02.887 --> 02:42:10.129]  So, uh, but the hospitals, uh, uh, the centers of death and you see they're being built everywhere.
[02:42:10.129 --> 02:42:12.549]  That's why they call it hospice where you go to die.
[02:42:12.549 --> 02:42:13.870]  They're using the right name.
[02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:14.510]  Go ahead.
[02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:15.730]  Right.
[02:42:15.730 --> 02:42:16.650]  Exactly.
[02:42:16.650 --> 02:42:22.332]  So as I stated, the, uh, the only reason you would want to visit one is for emergency reasons.
[02:42:22.332 --> 02:42:28.393]  Uh, and then it comes down to, uh, when you get there, they set you up in all these tests
[02:42:29.082 --> 02:42:38.371]  Uh, every time they take a test on you, I don't care if it's MMR or, or, or CAT scan or any type of test, uh, the doctor gets a kickback.
[02:42:38.371 --> 02:42:40.093]  300, 400 bucks.
[02:42:40.093 --> 02:42:43.676]  And that, and that's why they always prescribe, uh, prescribing them.
[02:42:43.676 --> 02:42:45.618]  And then they send, they send them off to their buddies.
[02:42:45.618 --> 02:42:52.044]  That's why you got to see specialists now because everyone needs to get a little piece of you so they can keep that money chain going.
[02:42:52.044 --> 02:42:52.345]  And so,
[02:42:52.881 --> 02:43:01.407]  The, uh, when you go in, if you're going, I know some of you are still using your HMOs and your PPOs and all these different health management systems, because that's what they are.
[02:43:01.407 --> 02:43:03.909]  They're there to manage your disease.
[02:43:03.909 --> 02:43:09.193]  You've got to be aware that when you go in, it's like a recruitment scheme to scare you.
[02:43:09.193 --> 02:43:15.638]  They create fear, F-E-A-R, false evidence appearing real, and then they got you.
[02:43:15.638 --> 02:43:16.638]  I call it the web.
[02:43:16.638 --> 02:43:17.379]  Once they got you,
[02:43:18.224 --> 02:43:20.466]  Uh, on one hand, and they, they get you.
[02:43:20.466 --> 02:43:22.107]  On the other hand, they create the fear.
[02:43:22.107 --> 02:43:23.248]  You go in, get the test.
[02:43:23.248 --> 02:43:26.090]  The test says this, and they start you on the drug.
[02:43:26.090 --> 02:43:33.436]  By the way, I have a good friend who has a lovely, I've known her for about two years, 24-year-old girlfriend, totally healthy, exercises, whatever.
[02:43:33.436 --> 02:43:36.358]  And, uh, she went to the hospital for a checkup.
[02:43:36.358 --> 02:43:38.980]  They told her she might have some cancer.
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:41.081]  They cut out part of her guts.
[02:43:41.081 --> 02:43:43.803]  She's been on chemo now for a year and a half, and her kidneys are failing.
[02:43:43.803 --> 02:43:44.264]  They're killing her.
[02:43:44.918 --> 02:43:45.778]  Wow.
[02:43:45.778 --> 02:43:47.419]  Wow.
[02:43:47.419 --> 02:43:48.920]  That's horrible.
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:44:00.945]  And just to mention, you said about the kidneys, you know, uh, 90% of the kidney dialysis, uh, are being, uh, used by African-Americans in America.
[02:44:00.945 --> 02:44:11.429]  And I've labeled the machine, the Negro machine, because, uh, uh, it's, it's, it's that they're popping up on corners, almost like liquor stores and they're everywhere.
[02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:13.990]  Every time I turn down the street, there's a new dialysis center coming up.
[02:44:14.879 --> 02:44:18.320]  And those things are a cash cow, big money.
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:25.581]  And that's because they teach people to only drink Coca-Cola and iced tea, eat all this processed, deadly stuff full of GMO.
[02:44:25.581 --> 02:44:29.362]  And it's not just black folks, particularly hitting them, it's tailored for that.
[02:44:29.362 --> 02:44:32.583]  Everybody, Hispanics, whites, all the numbers are exploding.
[02:44:32.583 --> 02:44:37.784]  These plagues, and they know that, I mean, look at Pedialyte, it's for your baby, full of aspartame.
[02:44:37.784 --> 02:44:39.384]  Look, when you go in the baby store, it says,
[02:44:40.757 --> 02:44:51.600]  Water for kids, with nutrients they need, fluoride added, and it's at four parts per million, when one part per million will, they admit, give you massive bone cancer in children, they admit this.
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:53.400]  But oh, see, they know what they're doing.
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:58.982]  Oh, just for your baby, aspartame, just for your baby, they need fluoride.
[02:44:58.982 --> 02:44:59.802]  Go ahead.
[02:44:59.802 --> 02:45:00.943]  Yes, no doubt.
[02:45:00.943 --> 02:45:08.004]  And they set our babies up with these 36 so-called mandatory vaccinations.
[02:45:08.004 --> 02:45:09.985]  They want to lay on them as soon as they come out of the womb.
[02:45:11.021 --> 02:45:15.848]  Uh, the uh, MMR vaccine, that's where you're getting all your autism from.
[02:45:15.848 --> 02:45:19.234]  And your DPT vaccine is where you get your SID.
[02:45:19.234 --> 02:45:21.097]  Uh, this stuff is uh, so deadly.
[02:45:21.784 --> 02:45:24.866]  And they want to act like it's something that's mysterious.
[02:45:24.866 --> 02:45:26.067]  Oh, where is this coming from?
[02:45:26.067 --> 02:45:37.916]  Well, a lot of times, as you know, doctor, the children have a convulsion in the hospital and the parents, or they have it in the car at home that night, then they arrest the parents saying, you shook your baby to death because there's blood on the brain.
[02:45:37.916 --> 02:45:40.698]  When all the studies show, it causes an autoimmune response.
[02:45:40.698 --> 02:45:44.521]  So they don't just kill your kid or brain damage him, then they arrest you.
[02:45:44.521 --> 02:45:46.102]  Even better, now the police get money.
[02:45:46.778 --> 02:45:47.338]  Oh yeah.
[02:45:47.338 --> 02:45:47.938]  Yeah.
[02:45:47.938 --> 02:45:49.299]  Uh, shaking baby syndrome.
[02:45:49.299 --> 02:45:55.602]  I had a brother, uh, Alan York down in Florida had that issue and a lot of other families have had that issue.
[02:45:55.602 --> 02:45:57.022]  And, uh, yeah, no doubt.
[02:45:57.022 --> 02:45:59.743]  The, uh, the mercury, they call it Stemersol.
[02:45:59.743 --> 02:46:06.886]  Now, you know, they said, Oh, we took all the mercury out, but Stemersol is what they put in there and you read the ingredients on Stemersol and it's 50% mercury.
[02:46:06.886 --> 02:46:13.249]  So these, these, these guys are, are satanic murderers and they're, they're so evil.
[02:46:13.249 --> 02:46:14.889]  And the CDC is part of it.
[02:46:14.889 --> 02:46:16.390]  The Center for Disease Creation,
[02:46:16.843 --> 02:46:32.746]  The AMA, the American Murder Association, all of them are all behind this and Big Pharma and those pediatricians who normally know they're jabbing and sticking our little babies with these poison tacos.
[02:46:32.746 --> 02:46:37.127]  You know, our parents, we sit up and say, don't do drugs, do not do drugs.
[02:46:37.127 --> 02:46:41.488]  And then we go and rush them down to the arms of somebody and stick drugs into their arms.
[02:46:41.488 --> 02:46:41.868]  Criminal.
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:45.901]  Injectors!
[02:46:45.901 --> 02:46:49.164]  Not to mention the cancer viruses in DNA and microplasm, they admit.
[02:46:49.164 --> 02:46:51.185]  But, please continue, Doctor.
[02:46:51.185 --> 02:46:52.846]  Yes.
[02:46:52.846 --> 02:47:02.533]  As you did mention earlier, the childhood cancers and childhood diabetes didn't even exist 20 years ago.
[02:47:02.533 --> 02:47:04.255]  Didn't even exist.
[02:47:04.255 --> 02:47:08.598]  Until they started this massive routine vaccination.
[02:47:08.598 --> 02:47:10.159]  And this is where this stuff is coming from.
[02:47:11.064 --> 02:47:19.436]  Uh, the, the, the swine flu, uh, vaccine, which was laced with the SD40 simian virus, uh, back in the fifties and sixties.
[02:47:19.436 --> 02:47:23.782]  So it's those, uh, those who came up during that timeframe.
[02:47:24.201 --> 02:47:28.862]  Most likely, you have these latent cancers now appearing in your lifestyle.
[02:47:28.862 --> 02:47:30.902]  And the people are wondering where it comes from.
[02:47:30.902 --> 02:47:32.342]  And by the way, they admit that.
[02:47:32.342 --> 02:47:36.623]  Over 200 million Americans with polio alone, and then the swine flu and others, were given this.
[02:47:36.623 --> 02:47:39.284]  And these were cancers that didn't exist.
[02:47:39.284 --> 02:47:41.284]  And these rare cancers are now everywhere.
[02:47:41.284 --> 02:47:44.405]  And they go, and every person that gets it, they go, oh, you have the SV40.
[02:47:44.405 --> 02:47:45.545]  They admit it's killing you.
[02:47:45.545 --> 02:47:48.105]  Just enjoy yourself, though.
[02:47:48.105 --> 02:47:49.405]  Oh yeah.
[02:47:49.405 --> 02:47:53.006]  And that's the other thing that's so irritating, that's so blatant.
[02:47:53.493 --> 02:47:57.035]  Openly with it, and they kind of brag about it.
[02:47:57.035 --> 02:48:02.899]  You know, like the number one killer in America is doctors.
[02:48:02.899 --> 02:48:05.000]  And they admit it on their AMA pages.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.342]  You know, we killed over half a million people last year, and so what?
[02:48:09.342 --> 02:48:13.305]  And then they even make jokes about it.
[02:48:13.305 --> 02:48:18.628]  I mean, they're so blatant with their arrogance and evil.
[02:48:18.628 --> 02:48:20.469]  But yet the American people, for some reason,
[02:48:21.649 --> 02:48:23.790]  Uh, are caught up into that white coat.
[02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:30.113]  I mean, that white coat that the MD wears is the same coat that a butcher wears.
[02:48:30.113 --> 02:48:33.875]  And they both do the same thing.
[02:48:33.875 --> 02:48:34.616]  Well said.
[02:48:34.616 --> 02:48:37.917]  Now, take my dad as a dentist and oral surgeon.
[02:48:37.917 --> 02:48:42.680]  I remember him, when I went to get my driver's license, he said, son, don't sign the organ donor part of that.
[02:48:43.829 --> 02:48:44.490]  And I said, why?
[02:48:44.490 --> 02:48:48.014]  And he said, well, a lot of hospitals here in Dallas will kill you.
[02:48:48.014 --> 02:48:52.439]  If you ever have a car wreck or something, and if you're not that hurt, because they can get a couple hundred grand, now it's close to a million.
[02:48:52.439 --> 02:48:54.862]  You know, that was 20 years ago or more.
[02:48:54.862 --> 02:48:55.343]  I'm getting old.
[02:48:57.558 --> 02:49:03.703]  And I kind of laughed at him, and then I saw it on 60 Minutes where hospitals were killing people for their organs.
[02:49:03.703 --> 02:49:09.407]  And I remember my dad, you know, reading medical reports in the 80s saying age was engineered and things.
[02:49:09.407 --> 02:49:14.911]  So, when you do talk to medical professionals, at least when they're older, they all know about this.
[02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:16.092]  It's the younger ones that don't.
[02:49:16.092 --> 02:49:18.694]  I mean, are you saying all the doctors know what they're doing?
[02:49:18.694 --> 02:49:23.998]  Or, I mean, I think they're all like on a god-like power trip, and they're kind of scared of the AMA, and they just do what they're told.
[02:49:25.199 --> 02:49:40.046]  I believe the ones maybe in the early years, the 40 and 50 ones, those guys who got that training from that era, I think they had more of a sense of an ethical, moral type of way they approached their profession.
[02:49:40.046 --> 02:49:43.587]  And the control isn't where it was as it is now.
[02:49:43.587 --> 02:49:50.590]  The young guys are going in there, the young girls, and basically they're all going into the profession because of the dollar.
[02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:51.151]  I agree with you.
[02:49:51.151 --> 02:49:53.392]  Ten years ago, they took away the Hippocratic Oath.
[02:49:53.392 --> 02:49:53.892]  Do no harm.
[02:49:54.491 --> 02:49:55.372]  Right, right.
[02:49:55.372 --> 02:49:58.874]  There's a great movie out called that, Do No Harm with Meryl Streep.
[02:49:58.874 --> 02:50:05.119]  Uh, uh, and so they go into this profession and I think it's all money driven.
[02:50:05.119 --> 02:50:15.567]  And, uh, and of course they're wined and dined from first year of med school all the way through and lavish boat rides and all that stuff.
[02:50:15.567 --> 02:50:22.832]  So when they come out, the drug of choice is the one that took me out to dinner and then they promote and then the pharmaceutical reps come in
[02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:25.111]  And they don't even read the inserts.
[02:50:25.111 --> 02:50:27.774]  They just say, oh yeah, we got this today, and why don't you try this out?
[02:50:27.774 --> 02:50:30.175]  And then the commercials, oh my God.
[02:50:30.175 --> 02:50:32.918]  Every commercial you see today is promoting drugs.
[02:50:32.918 --> 02:50:35.500]  I, I, I, literally half of them on the nightly news.
[02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:36.060]  Stay there.
[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:41.925]  He's the author of Medicine, S-I-N, and we'll give you his website when we come back on how to get the book.
[02:50:41.925 --> 02:50:45.268]  You're in Atlanta, the great Nubian bookstore, but it's, uh, this book needs to be everywhere.
[02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:47.389]  I read it, couldn't put it down.
[02:50:47.389 --> 02:50:48.951]  Very powerful one, I want to thank.
[02:50:49.851 --> 02:50:52.112]  Mr. Williams there for recommending the book to us.
[02:50:52.112 --> 02:50:53.973]  Dr. Whitaker is our guest.
[02:50:53.973 --> 02:50:56.074]  We'll come right back to him after this quick break.
[02:50:56.074 --> 02:51:00.497]  I've got a whole other hour coming up and your phone calls and I'm going to read this AP article.
[02:51:00.497 --> 02:51:01.337]  People don't trust us.
[02:51:01.337 --> 02:51:02.318]  They're not taking the shots.
[02:51:02.318 --> 02:51:06.700]  The new world order beast is genetically modifying your food.
[02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:08.481]  Genetically modifying.
[02:51:08.481 --> 02:51:13.844]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[02:51:13.844 --> 02:51:14.464]  Viruses.
[02:51:14.904 --> 02:51:20.653]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[02:51:20.653 --> 02:51:23.077]  Starve or surrender.
[02:51:23.077 --> 02:51:27.423]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[02:51:27.423 --> 02:51:28.304]  What then?
[02:51:31.019 --> 02:51:34.081]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[02:51:34.081 --> 02:51:38.423]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[02:51:38.423 --> 02:51:41.285]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[02:52:01.934 --> 02:52:07.743]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.743 --> 02:52:14.734]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.316 --> 02:52:21.862]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.862 --> 02:52:23.884]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.884 --> 02:52:26.387]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.387 --> 02:52:37.357]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.964 --> 02:52:39.626]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.626 --> 02:52:41.487]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.487 --> 02:52:48.394]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.661 --> 02:52:58.243]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.243 --> 02:52:59.424]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.206 --> 02:53:03.509]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[02:53:03.509 --> 02:53:05.652]  It's time to think outside the box.
[02:53:05.652 --> 02:53:07.634]  How about starting your own garden?
[02:53:07.634 --> 02:53:09.877]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.

[02:54:09.981 --> 02:54:11.142]  Dr. Scott Whitaker is our guest.
[02:54:22.614 --> 02:54:23.935]  Okay, I know I'm jumping in a lot here.
[02:54:23.935 --> 02:54:26.856]  It's just, it's just, it amazes me this much carnage is going on.
[02:54:26.856 --> 02:54:28.517]  And as you said, it's getting worse now.
[02:54:28.517 --> 02:54:31.339]  I discovered my film, Endgame, that it all is eugenics.
[02:54:31.339 --> 02:54:33.640]  That was the dominant thing, you know, 60, 70 years ago.
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:35.781]  They went underground because Hitler embarrassed them.
[02:54:35.781 --> 02:54:37.562]  That's why they brought the Nazis over here.
[02:54:37.562 --> 02:54:39.183]  They'd actually learned it from us.
[02:54:39.183 --> 02:54:43.305]  And this is what they're carrying out through compartmentalization.
[02:54:43.305 --> 02:54:45.847]  But please continue, sir.
[02:54:45.847 --> 02:54:48.168]  Oh yeah, that was the project Paperclip.
[02:54:48.757 --> 02:54:55.640]  Operation Paperclip where we brought those evil scientists over here and continue with their eugenics.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:05.785]  But the, you know, the current status in regards to our health is definitely affected when you go and get vaccinated.
[02:55:05.785 --> 02:55:15.770]  So all those people out there who are using so-called flu vaccine, you know, which is amazing to me, you know, from October to March,
[02:55:16.493 --> 02:55:21.657]  Supposedly this flu is floating around the air and landing on people and all this kind of stuff.
[02:55:21.657 --> 02:55:25.780]  So I always ask myself, what is it doing between April and September?
[02:55:25.780 --> 02:55:26.981]  It goes on vacation?
[02:55:26.981 --> 02:55:28.022]  It's in the Bahamas?
[02:55:28.022 --> 02:55:29.202]  I mean, where is it then?
[02:55:29.202 --> 02:55:30.744]  Why don't they talk about it then?
[02:55:30.744 --> 02:55:31.904]  So it is all a scam.
[02:55:31.904 --> 02:55:44.854]  And from my research, those people who use the flu vaccine and five years consecutively, if you had a flu shot, you've got 99% chance you're going to develop Alzheimer's because it's so much aluminum
[02:55:45.464 --> 02:55:47.946]  Today's flu vaccine.
[02:55:47.946 --> 02:55:59.015]  Of course, we have the chelators, the heavy metal chelators from using the herbal clingum to clean the body of the aluminum and offset that.
[02:55:59.015 --> 02:56:00.436]  But stay away from the flu.
[02:56:00.436 --> 02:56:10.944]  If you want to avoid the so-called flu, stop eating white flour, white sugar, Coca-Cola, mac doodles, Burger King, and Krispy Kreme, and you'll be okay.
[02:56:14.170 --> 02:56:17.752]  Continue, because the biggest thing is the food in the water, isn't it?
[02:56:17.752 --> 02:56:18.633]  Oh, the food.
[02:56:18.633 --> 02:56:25.337]  The greatest threat right now to mankind is the tempering of our food, which is going on daily.
[02:56:25.337 --> 02:56:28.078]  I mean, I can't see all mainstream media every single day.
[02:56:28.078 --> 02:56:32.981]  They're coming out with some type of new genetic food that they want to put on the market.
[02:56:32.981 --> 02:56:38.885]  Eighty percent of the foods now in all supermarkets are all genetic in terms of your produce.
[02:56:38.885 --> 02:56:41.226]  And even your meats now are cloned.
[02:56:41.226 --> 02:56:42.727]  Cloned meat is now in the market.
[02:56:44.128 --> 02:56:46.069]  And they won't even label it for us.
[02:56:46.069 --> 02:56:50.432]  They want to just lay it up there like it's looking like a real steak and it's not.
[02:56:50.432 --> 02:56:55.035]  So you got to be very careful on the meat that you select.
[02:56:55.035 --> 02:56:57.597]  They've been spraying them with viruses, live viruses.
[02:56:57.597 --> 02:57:00.158]  They want to protect us from listeria.
[02:57:00.158 --> 02:57:06.783]  So these individuals who are behind this, which is of course the FDA, your Department of Health,
[02:57:07.626 --> 02:57:13.738]  And the corporations, biotech corporations, and the main one being Monsanto, probably the most satanic corporation on the planet.
[02:57:13.738 --> 02:57:19.689]  Let me stop you there, because we're, again, six years ago they legalized
[02:57:20.603 --> 02:57:30.748]  Because there's so much E. Coli in the slaughterhouses, instead of just cleaning the meat or keeping it clean, they radiate it, which kills it, and the study's how it goes through your body and clogs everything up and has no value.
[02:57:30.748 --> 02:57:35.970]  Then they spray it, and the Latin word, as you know, Doctor, is virus-eating bacteria.
[02:57:35.970 --> 02:57:39.171]  That's the Latin, if you translate it into Latin, is the name.
[02:57:39.171 --> 02:57:41.653]  And they based it, and so it's a vaccine.
[02:57:41.653 --> 02:57:44.034]  They grow it in these big vats, other bacteria and viruses.
[02:57:45.234 --> 02:57:46.295]  Oh yeah, no doubt, no doubt.
[02:57:46.295 --> 02:57:48.336]  And also the ingredients of vaccines themselves.
[02:58:13.886 --> 02:58:21.311]  Uh, formaldehyde, uh, propylene glycol, aborted fetal tissue, mercury, aluminum.
[02:58:21.311 --> 02:58:22.412]  What's that got to do with health?
[02:58:22.412 --> 02:58:23.173]  Nothing.
[02:58:23.173 --> 02:58:31.379]  So, realize, people, that the only one that vaccines benefit is the manufacturer who made them.
[02:58:31.379 --> 02:58:34.181]  There is no benefit at all in vaccination.
[02:58:34.181 --> 02:58:35.762]  Dr. Scott Whitaker, stay there.
[02:58:35.762 --> 02:58:38.984]  Back in 70 seconds to continue.
[02:58:38.984 --> 02:58:39.745]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:43.655 --> 02:58:46.165]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.343 --> 02:58:53.044]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.044 --> 02:58:57.786]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.786 --> 02:59:00.747]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.747 --> 02:59:03.788]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.788 --> 02:59:09.871]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.871 --> 02:59:13.113]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.113 --> 02:59:16.234]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's
[02:59:16.374 --> 02:59:20.076]  Stay safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[02:59:47.150 --> 02:59:54.096]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.096 --> 02:59:56.498]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.498 --> 02:59:59.260]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:09.724 --> 03:00:12.926]  We are back live, fourth and final hour of this Friday edition.
[03:00:12.926 --> 03:00:18.070]  Webster Tarpley for a full two hours will be in studio with me on the 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:00:19.761 --> 03:00:21.062]  Abbreviated Sunday Show, we do.
[03:00:21.062 --> 03:00:26.085]  And he'll be in with us for about an hour and a half on Monday before he goes and gets on a plane down the road from here.
[03:00:26.085 --> 03:00:26.846]  Flies back to D.C.
[03:00:26.846 --> 03:00:32.590]  He's flying in tomorrow here to Austin, Texas for the second Obama film I'm making.
[03:00:32.590 --> 03:00:34.931]  I'll announce the details of the film, the name of the film next week.
[03:00:34.931 --> 03:00:36.152]  It'll be released on July 4th.
[03:00:36.152 --> 03:00:41.135]  Because the New World Order's betting everything they got on him to sucker the public back into their whole agenda.
[03:00:41.135 --> 03:00:42.176]  It's not gonna work.
[03:00:42.176 --> 03:00:45.418]  They even got him trying to promote Africa and saying, trust me, take the shots.
[03:00:45.418 --> 03:00:47.780]  I've even got that in the mainstream news today.
[03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:49.381]  And I want to go over that.
[03:00:51.303 --> 03:00:53.204]  Some on air.
[03:00:53.204 --> 03:00:57.067]  Continuing, sir, as you just dropped bombshell after bombshell.
[03:00:57.067 --> 03:00:57.427]  Doctor?
[03:00:57.427 --> 03:01:05.092]  Yes, also wanted to give a shout out to Brother Marcus there at Nubian Books for even allowing this to happen, take place.
[03:01:06.051 --> 03:01:12.934]  Well, no, I'm just glad he told me about the book and we got one because there's so many great people that I don't even know about that you don't know about getting us all together.
[03:01:12.934 --> 03:01:16.855]  Speaking of Barack Obama, I mean, you've studied this whole situation.
[03:01:16.855 --> 03:01:24.678]  Would this wicked establishment let a real good president, whether he was black, white, purple, polka-dotted, I mean, would they let a good guy in?
[03:01:24.678 --> 03:01:26.739]  No, not at all.
[03:01:26.739 --> 03:01:34.902]  Of course, when you look at history and history of presidents, you will see that there are
[03:01:36.404 --> 03:01:39.686]  Uh, bloodline, all related.
[03:01:39.686 --> 03:01:47.669]  And that they, uh, anyone who steps outside of their, of the, of the, of the line that they supposed to tow is eliminated.
[03:01:47.669 --> 03:01:57.453]  We can go back to Andrew Jackson, Lincoln, uh, Garfield, and, and, uh, of course, Kennedy, all these guys went up against the international bankers.
[03:01:57.453 --> 03:01:59.714]  And of course they were eliminated.
[03:01:59.714 --> 03:02:03.196]  Uh, so Obama is just a face piece.
[03:02:03.914 --> 03:02:20.001]  He is just someone who is there to give hope, calm the masses down, and then present himself, at least to certain people, as a so-called messiah, which is very laughable at best.
[03:02:20.001 --> 03:02:26.204]  So, no, they won't let any so-called good guy get into that position at all.
[03:02:26.204 --> 03:02:33.387]  That position is there for tyranny, oppression, and to keep people confused, and definitely
[03:02:34.209 --> 03:02:37.671]  Uh, let Big Pharma and Big Oil do what they do.
[03:02:39.929 --> 03:02:41.930]  Look at what he's doing with Africa.
[03:02:41.930 --> 03:02:44.352]  I mean, he's announcing AfriCorps.
[03:02:44.352 --> 03:02:47.433]  They want to put troops in Africa.
[03:02:47.433 --> 03:02:52.376]  He's doubling the funding for the vaccines and abortions in Africa.
[03:02:52.376 --> 03:02:59.180]  I mean, the globalists love him because Africa, according to the news, is not trusting the establishment anymore, rightly so.
[03:02:59.180 --> 03:03:02.162]  They say, oh, the Africans are ignorant and backward.
[03:03:02.162 --> 03:03:07.885]  They think the vaccines have cancer and HIV in them, when there's Nobel Prize winners that have studied it and say it's in there.
[03:03:08.539 --> 03:03:32.841]  Oh yeah, well, when we study the oppression of colonization, America going over there doing their thing, British going over there doing their thing, every other country going over and using Africa as a doormat and taking all the resources, killing the people with biological weapons,
[03:03:34.284 --> 03:03:37.466]  Giving them genetic food, that's not going to help anybody.
[03:03:37.466 --> 03:04:00.437]  And he's going over there as a philanthropist, peacemaker, and all he's going over there to do is to set up those governments so that they can keep sapping those natural resources, keeping the people in strife and conflict between tribals, tribal wars, and then so they can pillage the whole continent of Africa as they've been doing before.
[03:04:02.489 --> 03:04:16.091]  I'm sure you've seen the Senate letter that got leaked, and Obama admits it's real, where in Kenya, he was trying, through Odinga, his cousin, to get the Muslims and Christians killing each other to bring the nation down.
[03:04:16.091 --> 03:04:18.112]  I mean, that is evil!
[03:04:18.112 --> 03:04:18.752]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:04:18.752 --> 03:04:24.893]  They've always used, you know, they'll try to say, you know, people say, oh, religion is the cause of war.
[03:04:24.893 --> 03:04:26.133]  No, it's not the case.
[03:04:26.133 --> 03:04:31.174]  There's the case where you have these agents, provocateurs, going in,
[03:04:31.775 --> 03:04:37.057]  Creating conflict between two different groups, and so they can fight and kill each other off.
[03:04:37.057 --> 03:04:38.578]  It works perfectly.
[03:04:38.578 --> 03:04:40.999]  Okay, Doctor, start over with that, because you've got to interrupt it by the break.
[03:04:40.999 --> 03:04:45.921]  Start over with these Asian provocateurs when we come back, and we're going to talk one more segment and start taking calls.
[03:04:45.921 --> 03:04:47.782]  I've got to have you back as a regular guest.
[03:04:47.782 --> 03:04:51.524]  The book is Medicine, and we'll have him tell you directly the best place to get it.
[03:04:51.524 --> 03:04:55.766]  Give it to everybody you know, ladies and gentlemen, because you can save lives.
[03:04:55.766 --> 03:04:57.086]  We're turning the corner.
[03:04:57.086 --> 03:04:58.007]  We're waking people up.
[03:04:58.007 --> 03:05:01.088]  I'm going to read part of this AP report and get Dr. Whitaker's take on that.
[03:05:01.877 --> 03:05:05.398]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:05:05.398 --> 03:05:10.800]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:15.962]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:05:15.962 --> 03:05:27.086]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:05:27.486 --> 03:05:33.248]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:05:33.248 --> 03:05:39.509]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:05:39.509 --> 03:05:40.550]  What about you?
[03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:46.992]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:06:01.695 --> 03:06:07.519]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.519 --> 03:06:14.524]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.097 --> 03:06:21.664]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.664 --> 03:06:23.646]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.646 --> 03:06:26.149]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.149 --> 03:06:37.101]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:37.722 --> 03:06:39.383]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.383 --> 03:06:41.243]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.243 --> 03:06:48.166]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.166 --> 03:06:56.430]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.430 --> 03:06:57.990]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:59.191]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.260 --> 03:07:02.621]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:07:02.621 --> 03:07:05.022]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:07:05.022 --> 03:07:09.184]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:07:09.184 --> 03:07:11.225]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[03:07:15.435 --> 03:07:15.996]  For the rest of you,
[03:07:46.175 --> 03:07:46.875]  We're good to go.
[03:08:18.869 --> 03:08:33.446]  Dr. Scott Whitaker, I want you to start over as you got interrupted by the break explaining what agent provocateurs, what front men do in society and continue with other comments on what Barack Obama's doing because one of the biggest
[03:08:34.969 --> 03:08:37.129]  Group of listeners we have per capita.
[03:08:37.129 --> 03:08:42.831]  Now for 12% of the population, we're way over represented with listeners of black Americans because they know not to trust the system.
[03:08:42.831 --> 03:08:44.371]  They've seen the scams.
[03:08:44.371 --> 03:08:47.752]  A lot of Americans are fat, dumb and happy and think this is, you know, everything's fine.
[03:08:47.752 --> 03:08:51.813]  But now under Obama, you know, they're really buying into the government health care.
[03:08:51.813 --> 03:08:55.334]  Everybody is, but they're really buying into, hey, I can trust Barack Obama.
[03:08:55.334 --> 03:08:57.094]  I'm going, no, he's controlled by eugenicists.
[03:08:57.594 --> 03:09:00.015]  He's increasing the attacks on Africa.
[03:09:00.015 --> 03:09:00.815]  Bill and Melinda Gates.
[03:09:00.815 --> 03:09:01.676]  Bill Gates is behind him.
[03:09:01.676 --> 03:09:07.678]  His dad heads Planned Parenthood, where she openly called black people weeds that had to be exterminated and taught Hitler everything he knew.
[03:09:07.678 --> 03:09:08.838]  Margaret Sanger.
[03:09:08.838 --> 03:09:11.419]  And then all these black high schools.
[03:09:11.419 --> 03:09:15.360]  One I went to, because I lived by White Rock Lake when I was in first grade.
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:16.541]  My kindergarten.
[03:09:16.541 --> 03:09:19.262]  And, you know, the school's probably 60% black.
[03:09:19.262 --> 03:09:20.382]  And it was Margaret Sanger.
[03:09:23.274 --> 03:09:24.535]  Kindergarten.
[03:09:24.535 --> 03:09:27.077]  And they had a statue of her out there in Dallas.
[03:09:27.077 --> 03:09:28.518]  So, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[03:09:28.518 --> 03:09:33.901]  Can you speak directly, particularly to black folks, but everybody else, and, you know, how do we get them to listen?
[03:09:33.901 --> 03:09:41.606]  But, that secondarily, finish up with what you were saying about Obama in Africa and agent provocateurs.
[03:09:41.606 --> 03:09:42.787]  Yes.
[03:09:42.787 --> 03:09:52.374]  Well, of course, they're using a black face, okay, in terms of externally showing a black face, so that
[03:09:53.464 --> 03:09:59.087]  You know, the rest of the world, I guess, was tired of seeing a white face colonize them.
[03:09:59.087 --> 03:10:01.909]  So they figured, I guess, a black face would be better.
[03:10:01.909 --> 03:10:10.614]  And so they're using this image of this man and using it as a sign of a peace.
[03:10:10.614 --> 03:10:12.235]  You know, I'll be coming to help you.
[03:10:12.235 --> 03:10:13.736]  That type of philanthropic
[03:10:15.965 --> 03:10:16.165]  I think?
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:54.245]  And, uh, that universal health care is very, very serious because, uh, you won't be able to do anything else but go to them.
[03:10:54.245 --> 03:10:58.307]  I mean, they'll put, uh, herbs and vitamins as prescriptions.
[03:10:58.307 --> 03:11:08.373]  And, uh, we got Codex Alimentaris possibly going into effect at the end of this year, uh, uh, 09, which is, uh, they're, they're calling all vitamins toxins.
[03:11:08.373 --> 03:11:10.915]  So, uh, this is very sinister and satanic.
[03:11:11.664 --> 03:11:14.287]  And then they'll promote biotech.
[03:11:14.287 --> 03:11:19.012]  More genetic foods will be coming on the market every single day.
[03:11:19.012 --> 03:11:20.694]  And by the time you look up...
[03:11:21.532 --> 03:11:24.553]  Your whole market will be nothing but Frankenfoods, Frankenstein.
[03:11:24.553 --> 03:11:25.633]  Well, there's another example.
[03:11:25.633 --> 03:11:39.336]  With this eugenics agenda, they're like, oh, it's a great thing, we're fighting to get this establishment healthcare, and then it's killing you once you go in there, and they call it a practice, as they practice their art on you like you're guinea pigs.
[03:11:39.336 --> 03:11:40.757]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[03:11:40.757 --> 03:11:44.458]  So, specifically, this is about enforcing vaccines.
[03:11:44.458 --> 03:11:44.978]  They've already
[03:11:46.218 --> 03:11:50.540]  The FDA, as you know, came out and just listed a type of B vitamin as prescription.
[03:11:50.540 --> 03:11:53.200]  So they're going to say, oh, you've got to get a prescription for that.
[03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:54.041]  Exactly.
[03:11:54.041 --> 03:11:54.501]  Exactly.
[03:11:54.501 --> 03:11:55.661]  They skillfully do it.
[03:11:55.661 --> 03:11:59.283]  And they tried it there in New Jersey and Maryland.
[03:11:59.283 --> 03:12:03.904]  Gunpoint Medicine there with the students who didn't want to be vaccinated.
[03:12:03.904 --> 03:12:06.105]  They took them to court with AK-47.
[03:12:06.105 --> 03:12:11.327]  So this stuff is on the move.
[03:12:11.327 --> 03:12:13.348]  It's coming to your town.
[03:12:13.348 --> 03:12:14.428]  It's very serious.
[03:12:14.966 --> 03:12:18.529]  This legislation, this new one just came out, this HR 875.
[03:12:18.529 --> 03:12:23.073]  They're going to eliminate all organic farming.
[03:12:23.073 --> 03:12:25.295]  You can't have farmer's markets anymore.
[03:12:25.295 --> 03:12:28.798]  You can't even grow vegetables in your backyard.
[03:12:28.798 --> 03:12:30.559]  Very dangerous.
[03:12:30.559 --> 03:12:36.845]  That lady that's putting that up, what's her name, Republican Rosa DeLauro.
[03:12:36.845 --> 03:12:39.647]  Her husband is Stanley Greenberg who works at Monsanto.
[03:12:40.287 --> 03:12:44.989]  So these people are satanic and evil and murderers.
[03:12:44.989 --> 03:12:45.449]  That's right.
[03:12:45.449 --> 03:12:49.410]  Monsanto is the most satanic corporation on the planet.
[03:12:49.410 --> 03:12:51.651]  I don't want to interrupt you because we hit that break earlier.
[03:12:51.651 --> 03:12:53.132]  You were talking about Monsanto.
[03:12:53.132 --> 03:12:53.872]  Take your time.
[03:12:53.872 --> 03:12:55.573]  Get into Monsanto right now for folks.
[03:12:55.573 --> 03:12:55.993]  Go ahead.
[03:12:55.993 --> 03:12:56.873]  Yeah, Monsanto.
[03:12:56.873 --> 03:12:57.953]  I broke that name down.
[03:12:57.953 --> 03:12:59.294]  It means mon-o-satan.
[03:12:59.294 --> 03:12:59.854]  One Satan.
[03:12:59.854 --> 03:13:00.574]  Very satanic.
[03:13:00.574 --> 03:13:04.836]  They're the ones that gave us Agent Orange and RBGH growth hormone.
[03:13:08.308 --> 03:13:13.990]  Demisol and all these different chemicals and now we see in the market that's going to our bodies.
[03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:15.271]  Monsanto was behind most of it.
[03:13:15.271 --> 03:13:26.035]  If you go rent the movie Damien Omen 3 and when they talk about thorn corporations, separate, take thorn and put Monsanto in the same place and you see what's going on.
[03:13:26.035 --> 03:13:30.556]  They want to control the whole food supply of the world.
[03:13:30.556 --> 03:13:32.537]  Anybody who can sit in a laboratory
[03:13:33.132 --> 03:13:40.573]  And make a food that only makes a seed that only produces one time, then you have to go back to that company to get the seed again.
[03:13:40.573 --> 03:13:42.194]  It's satanic.
[03:13:42.194 --> 03:13:48.475]  So you got these terminator seeds that they produce and give them to these farmers on these genetic soils.
[03:13:48.475 --> 03:13:56.176]  It produces one yield and then that farmer has to go back to Monsanto begging for a seed to go plant again for the following year.
[03:13:56.176 --> 03:13:59.897]  So it's a controlled food supply and people
[03:14:00.396 --> 03:14:07.400]  Have to get back to the basics and learning how to grow their own food and supporting their local organic farmers.
[03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:08.900]  Very, very important.
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:16.404]  Well, doctor, I saw a report out of Oklahoma with one of their major cities with a city councilman saying people are planting gardens.
[03:14:16.404 --> 03:14:18.085]  I don't know if we can trust him to do that.
[03:14:18.085 --> 03:14:24.929]  We need to inspect their gardens and have licenses to have a garden in your backyard or a community garden because you might grow marijuana.
[03:14:24.929 --> 03:14:27.010]  See, that's guilty until proven innocent.
[03:14:27.010 --> 03:14:27.930]  We're all prisoners.
[03:14:27.930 --> 03:14:28.591]  Speak to that.
[03:14:29.671 --> 03:14:35.033]  And how that ties into the federal bill that openly bans organic farming, selling eggs on the street corner.
[03:14:35.033 --> 03:14:40.456]  There's SWAT teaming the Amish, selling milk or eggs, and people with food pantries.
[03:14:40.456 --> 03:14:43.197]  I mean, they really do want to shut this down.
[03:14:43.197 --> 03:14:48.839]  And Obama, again, no matter who's in office, it just expands, but it's expanding under him.
[03:14:48.839 --> 03:14:54.782]  And then Monsanto brought us through Searle, their subsidiary, Aspartame, now in over 10,000 foods.
[03:14:54.782 --> 03:14:55.642]  Yes.
[03:14:55.642 --> 03:14:58.083]  And that was brought in by Donald Rumsfeld.
[03:14:58.892 --> 03:15:02.175]  And uh, you know how criminal he was.
[03:15:02.175 --> 03:15:03.315]  But yeah, this H.R.
[03:15:03.315 --> 03:15:04.857]  875, that's what that's for.
[03:15:04.857 --> 03:15:10.361]  That's to eliminate the organic farmers, your farmers markets, selling foods on the corner.
[03:15:10.361 --> 03:15:11.602]  It's to eliminate all that.
[03:15:11.602 --> 03:15:14.824]  Because they know the people want real food today.
[03:15:14.824 --> 03:15:16.906]  And they're tired of this genetic stuff.
[03:15:16.906 --> 03:15:20.428]  They're growing fruits and vegetables that they pick, uh, green.
[03:15:20.428 --> 03:15:22.770]  They put them into a fumigation.
[03:15:23.459 --> 03:15:23.539]  Uh,
[03:15:53.993 --> 03:15:59.218]  And at the same time, when we get sick, we gotta go to them anyway.
[03:15:59.218 --> 03:16:01.259]  And then they give us more drugs.
[03:16:01.259 --> 03:16:03.081]  So it's just chemicals after chemicals.
[03:16:03.081 --> 03:16:04.862]  It all goes back to IG Farben.
[03:16:04.862 --> 03:16:06.324]  They're in Germany.
[03:16:06.324 --> 03:16:10.787]  The German plant, who is now Bayer, who during World War II wasn't even bombed.
[03:16:10.787 --> 03:16:14.611]  The whole place was told not to touch.
[03:16:14.611 --> 03:16:21.817]  And today, IG Farben, which is today Bayer, is nothing but a chemical company.
[03:16:22.347 --> 03:16:27.720]  And chemicals are nothing but drugs, and drugs is what controls all the medical schools in America.
[03:16:28.086 --> 03:16:50.335]  Well remember Bayer Pharmaceutical and scores of subsidiaries for more than a decade when they knew every shot of Factor VIII for the hemophiliacs and others was filled with HIV and filled with all types of hepatitis and other things and they knew it and their memos came out even MSNBC reported it and they knowingly shipped it out infecting millions.
[03:16:50.335 --> 03:16:53.457]  That isn't just greed, this is what they believe in.
[03:16:53.457 --> 03:16:55.658]  Oh yeah, no doubt, no doubt.
[03:16:58.863 --> 03:17:00.304]  I mean, we're dealing with some people here.
[03:17:00.304 --> 03:17:03.745]  I actually believe one day they're actually going to try to shoot a rocket at the sun.
[03:17:03.745 --> 03:17:08.386]  I mean, these people are absolutely barbaric, satanic.
[03:17:08.386 --> 03:17:10.267]  They care nothing about human life.
[03:17:10.267 --> 03:17:15.568]  It's almost like they're, you know, reptiles or something because they have no emotion.
[03:17:15.568 --> 03:17:26.291]  And it's so sad because the American population and, you know, some who are so caught up on CNN, the criminal news network,
[03:17:27.293 --> 03:17:33.937]  And anything that comes out that they say, they just follow it.
[03:17:33.937 --> 03:17:34.857]  I really don't understand that.
[03:17:34.857 --> 03:17:43.663]  Especially when you ask me about the African-American people here and how they're being tricked into this Messiah image.
[03:17:43.663 --> 03:17:50.927]  And we know the history of America and what it did to our ancestors, bringing us here, working us to death, didn't pay nobody.
[03:17:50.927 --> 03:17:56.530]  Then the 60s came and killed all of our leaders, King, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton.
[03:17:57.220 --> 03:18:03.944]  And uh, uh, always setting up roadblocks and tricks of COINTELPRO and things of that sort.
[03:18:03.944 --> 03:18:14.931]  So, uh, to actually think that today that anything has changed because a new face has entered into the office is absolutely ridiculous.
[03:18:16.854 --> 03:18:18.395]  Well then look at how he's gone back.
[03:18:18.395 --> 03:18:19.656]  He said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists.
[03:18:19.656 --> 03:18:21.057]  That's all he did.
[03:18:21.057 --> 03:18:23.938]  He said that he wasn't going to keep detainees without rights.
[03:18:23.938 --> 03:18:27.561]  In all the headlines, Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees.
[03:18:27.561 --> 03:18:32.204]  He's protecting Bush and blocking congressional investigations of all the crimes Bush committed.
[03:18:32.204 --> 03:18:34.585]  He's launching all these new wars.
[03:18:34.585 --> 03:18:38.588]  He's got all these top globalists like Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski in there.
[03:18:38.588 --> 03:18:41.610]  He's increasing the eugenics funding in Asia, Africa, Latin America.
[03:18:42.490 --> 03:18:44.852]  And then I see white folks, black folks, whatever.
[03:18:44.852 --> 03:18:45.712]  It's like they're in a cult.
[03:18:45.712 --> 03:18:47.473]  They're like, I just love him.
[03:18:47.473 --> 03:18:48.654]  He's Jesus.
[03:18:48.654 --> 03:18:53.317]  And I'm like, no, you got to understand this is a black face on the New World Order.
[03:18:53.317 --> 03:18:55.498]  They are trying to fool you.
[03:18:55.498 --> 03:18:59.380]  And now they say, yeah, well, Obama had to lie to get into office, but I still like him.
[03:18:59.380 --> 03:19:00.921]  Man, they're in trouble.
[03:19:00.921 --> 03:19:03.402]  They're in big trouble.
[03:19:03.402 --> 03:19:05.123]  You know, it goes back to that.
[03:19:05.123 --> 03:19:10.767]  You know, I watch a lot of documentaries and movies, and of course, I got my Obama deception here.
[03:19:11.391 --> 03:19:15.354]  I'm telling everybody about it because it's outstanding.
[03:19:15.354 --> 03:19:23.599]  That movie that came out a while back called Sicko with Michael Moore, that was promoting universal health care.
[03:19:23.599 --> 03:19:30.023]  And if you know Michael Moore, his agent is Rahm Emanuel's brother.
[03:19:30.023 --> 03:19:37.769]  So I'm very curious about who's controlling Michael Moore and what he's putting out.
[03:19:42.011 --> 03:19:58.189]  Like they had the movie Blood Diamond about, ooh, there's these evil diamonds that cause slavery in Africa, but what they don't tell you is the big diamond company, the big monopoly, runs those, and they don't want Africans to be able to have their own diamonds, so it's in the name of helping Africa, but it actually tells the truth halfway, but doesn't.
[03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:59.651]  Well, stay there, we'll talk about it when we get back.
[03:20:01.636 --> 03:20:02.957]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.957 --> 03:20:08.540]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.540 --> 03:20:13.543]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.543 --> 03:20:19.127]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that it could even happen again.
[03:20:19.127 --> 03:20:24.350]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.350 --> 03:20:26.231]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:20:26.656 --> 03:20:31.460]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.460 --> 03:20:32.581]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.581 --> 03:20:35.363]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:20:35.363 --> 03:20:39.266]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.266 --> 03:20:42.468]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:42.468 --> 03:20:44.690]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:45.631]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:45.631 --> 03:20:46.031]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:46.031 --> 03:20:46.932]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[03:20:55.845 --> 03:20:59.168]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:09.770 --> 03:21:14.013]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.013 --> 03:21:20.498]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.498 --> 03:21:22.500]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.500 --> 03:21:24.962]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:21:24.962 --> 03:21:35.850]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.132 --> 03:21:39.793]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.793 --> 03:21:41.654]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.654 --> 03:21:48.578]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.578 --> 03:21:56.842]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.842 --> 03:21:58.403]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.403 --> 03:22:01.345]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.345 --> 03:22:07.548]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:08.010 --> 03:22:16.133]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:16.133 --> 03:22:24.297]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:24.297 --> 03:22:29.399]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.399 --> 03:22:34.021]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.597 --> 03:22:38.938]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[03:22:38.938 --> 03:22:40.038]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:40.038 --> 03:22:44.539]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.539 --> 03:22:49.440]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:52.440]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:22:52.440 --> 03:22:54.201]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:54.201 --> 03:22:54.441]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.948 --> 03:23:04.391]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:23:04.391 --> 03:23:08.655]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:23:08.655 --> 03:23:16.623]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:23:16.883 --> 03:23:17.323]  We're good to go!
[03:23:49.707 --> 03:23:50.909]  We're good to go.
[03:24:20.067 --> 03:24:24.311]  All those drifter's days are past me now.
[03:24:24.311 --> 03:24:29.696]  I've got so much more to think about.
[03:24:29.696 --> 03:24:32.819]  Deadlines and commitments.
[03:24:32.819 --> 03:24:38.785]  What to leave in, what to leave out.
[03:24:38.785 --> 03:24:41.807]  Against the wind.
[03:24:41.807 --> 03:24:44.410]  We were running against the wind.
[03:24:52.642 --> 03:24:54.123]  Dr. Skye Whitaker is our guest.
[03:24:54.123 --> 03:24:55.084]  Short segment right now.
[03:24:55.084 --> 03:24:55.925]  Long segment coming up.
[03:24:55.925 --> 03:24:57.706]  Going directly to your phone calls.
[03:24:57.706 --> 03:25:00.229]  When we start the next segment, so be sure and stay with us.
[03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:06.374]  MetaSyn.net is the website if you want to check it out and get his fine book.
[03:25:08.608 --> 03:25:10.869]  I wanted to get to this article before we go to calls.
[03:25:10.869 --> 03:25:14.530]  Now listen to this desperate propaganda, and I see this all over the news every day.
[03:25:14.530 --> 03:25:22.792]  I hear it on BBC Radio, on XM in my car, all over the world, from Middle East to Asia to Europe to the United States to England.
[03:25:22.792 --> 03:25:25.493]  But in places like Africa, more than half the people refuse.
[03:25:25.493 --> 03:25:27.513]  They'll even pay them to take the vaccines and they say no.
[03:25:27.513 --> 03:25:31.134]  They'll pay them to take GMO crops and plant them, they say no.
[03:25:31.134 --> 03:25:32.315]  Because people are getting wise.
[03:25:32.315 --> 03:25:33.555]  Listen to this, Associated Press.
[03:25:33.555 --> 03:25:36.176]  Vaccine refusals spur outbreak fears.
[03:25:36.676 --> 03:25:44.882]  But if you supposedly have already taken the vaccine and you're protected, which you're really not, actually gives you the disease in many cases, that's admitted, then why would you need to take it?
[03:25:44.882 --> 03:25:48.986]  But listen to this, you know, because other people, why does it matter if you've taken it and other people haven't?
[03:25:48.986 --> 03:25:50.267]  You're protected.
[03:25:50.267 --> 03:25:58.313]  A widespread scare about vaccine side effects in Ukraine has led to a sharp drop in immunizations that could result in disease outbreaks spreading beyond the former Soviet Republic.
[03:25:58.653 --> 03:26:00.677]  International and local health officials say.
[03:26:00.677 --> 03:26:11.214]  Hundreds of thousands of fearful Ukrainians have refused vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria, mumps, polio, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and others this year according to official estimates.
[03:26:11.214 --> 03:26:12.696]  Authorities have
[03:26:13.973 --> 03:26:18.875]  He just canceled a U.N.-backed measles and rubella vaccination campaign funded by U.S.
[03:26:18.875 --> 03:26:26.619]  philanthropist Ted Turner, who's a eugenicist, and at a press club dinner said we need to get rid of all these GD useless feeders, a Hitler quote.
[03:26:26.619 --> 03:26:35.963]  Big public eugenicist says get rid of 80% of us, in Time Magazine, but he's got a shot for you, just like the heads of Planned Parenthood, his daddy, Bill Gates' daddy.
[03:26:35.963 --> 03:26:39.185]  I've got a Bill Moyers with him talking about getting rid of people, Bill Gates.
[03:26:39.185 --> 03:26:41.406]  Oh, but he wants to give you shots because he loves you.
[03:26:43.004 --> 03:26:50.029]  He goes, authorities have cancelled the U.N.-backed measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination campaign because 9 million people refused that.
[03:26:50.029 --> 03:26:53.952]  So they've, that's just a one-shot program, and they said, no, we're not taking it.
[03:26:53.952 --> 03:27:01.897]  I never thought I'd see the day where perfectly good vaccines were being destroyed, said Michael Bokakov of a spokesman for UNICEF.
[03:27:01.897 --> 03:27:06.801]  Around the world, health officials say they are struggling with the repercussions of vaccine fears they call unwarranted and dangerous.
[03:27:07.731 --> 03:27:14.514]  And then it says, well, since, it says a bunch of people have been dying from vaccines in Ukraine, and so that's why they won't take it.
[03:27:14.514 --> 03:27:21.537]  And they said northern, you know, in northern Nigeria, there's a boycott of polio shots believing HIV is in it.
[03:27:21.537 --> 03:27:22.718]  Well, they were caught doing that.
[03:27:22.718 --> 03:27:33.763]  They caught them, UN workers, and this was mainstream news, in Libya, and they had whole wards of kids getting HIV who never had sex.
[03:27:33.763 --> 03:27:34.904]  And they caught them with it in there.
[03:27:36.164 --> 03:27:47.610]  I mean, this is going on, and the whole article is trying to spin this and say it's not good, that people aren't taking it, but this is great news that all over the world people are saying, I'm not going to touch your stuff.
[03:27:47.610 --> 03:27:49.992]  Dr. Whitaker.
[03:27:49.992 --> 03:27:50.552]  I love that.
[03:27:50.552 --> 03:28:01.258]  When I hear stuff like that, that means that people are listening, waking up, and refusing to let poisons be injected into their bodies, into their family's body.
[03:28:01.258 --> 03:28:04.880]  And of course, they're going to always spin the media,
[03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:09.974]  Make it seem like they're doing something wrong or something bad.
[03:28:09.974 --> 03:28:14.978]  Like a couple of these parents here in the states who refuse to have their children vaccinated.
[03:28:14.978 --> 03:28:23.805]  Like I said, they were forced at gunpoint, AK-47s, to go to the downtown court in New Jersey and in Maryland.
[03:28:24.324 --> 03:28:27.785]  And, uh, almost made to take these vaccines.
[03:28:27.785 --> 03:28:29.905]  By the way, I had the state attorney on.
[03:28:29.905 --> 03:28:32.626]  This was predominantly black kids that were making do this, and he was black.
[03:28:32.626 --> 03:28:35.266]  And he laughed and said, I don't vaccinate my children.
[03:28:35.266 --> 03:28:36.946]  But I said, there's no law to take vaccines, is there?
[03:28:36.946 --> 03:28:38.227]  And he said, no.
[03:28:38.227 --> 03:28:43.367]  But they still told him it was the law, and had police with M-16s and police dogs.
[03:28:43.367 --> 03:28:45.808]  We had reporters there, and it was on the national news.
[03:28:45.808 --> 03:28:48.908]  Thousands lined up being forcibly injected when there's no law.
[03:28:48.908 --> 03:28:51.209]  If that isn't a bankrupt, fraudulent government, what is?
[03:28:51.969 --> 03:28:52.969]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:28:52.969 --> 03:29:01.412]  And you got these bootlicking Uncle Tom, so-called Negro leaders, who will protect the establishment.
[03:29:01.412 --> 03:29:02.652]  They're called the Boulay.
[03:29:02.652 --> 03:29:08.453]  And these are probably some of the worst people ever, in terms of black leadership.
[03:29:08.453 --> 03:29:19.716]  And they do nothing but help the establishment keep everybody else down while they benefit from all the other perks that they receive.
[03:29:19.716 --> 03:29:21.657]  And they are some of the worst people on Earth.
[03:29:23.527 --> 03:29:28.591]  But why would the guy even admit he doesn't vaccinate his kids and then snicker about it?
[03:29:28.591 --> 03:29:33.414]  Oh, because he knows how foolish it is to even do it.
[03:29:33.414 --> 03:29:35.176]  And so he knows the law.
[03:29:35.176 --> 03:29:42.121]  So he's like, yeah, I'm going to make you guys do it, but I definitely won't do it.
[03:29:42.121 --> 03:29:46.925]  75% of the doctors were interviewed and asked if they do chemotherapy, and they said no.
[03:29:46.925 --> 03:29:48.566]  They'll give it to their patient.
[03:29:49.090 --> 03:29:50.153]  Yep, stay there.
[03:29:50.153 --> 03:29:51.857]  Call's straight ahead.
[03:29:51.857 --> 03:29:53.260]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.260 --> 03:29:55.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.787 --> 03:29:58.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.949 --> 03:30:05.031]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:30:05.031 --> 03:30:10.555]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:30:10.555 --> 03:30:16.279]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:30:16.279 --> 03:30:17.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:26.766]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:30:27.066 --> 03:30:28.908]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:30:28.908 --> 03:30:33.133]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:30:33.133 --> 03:30:38.139]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[03:30:38.139 --> 03:30:40.221]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[03:30:42.083 --> 03:30:43.965]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[03:31:05.347 --> 03:31:07.971]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.971 --> 03:31:14.982]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.558 --> 03:31:22.140]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.140 --> 03:31:24.120]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.120 --> 03:31:26.621]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.621 --> 03:31:38.184]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.184 --> 03:31:39.865]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.865 --> 03:31:41.225]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.716 --> 03:31:48.624]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:56.893 --> 03:31:58.475]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.475 --> 03:31:59.677]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.468 --> 03:32:05.169]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:32:05.169 --> 03:32:10.891]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:32:10.891 --> 03:32:15.232]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:32:15.232 --> 03:32:17.693]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[03:32:17.693 --> 03:32:23.655]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[03:32:23.755 --> 03:32:24.295]  We're good to go!

[03:32:55.579 --> 03:32:56.340]  Free shipping included.
[03:32:56.340 --> 03:32:58.802]  Some folks are born silver spoon in their hand, though they help themselves.
[03:33:16.224 --> 03:33:20.334]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[03:33:20.334 --> 03:33:23.180]  Ooh, they're red, white, and blue.
[03:33:25.484 --> 03:33:30.407]  We're going to go to Scott, Nathan, Doesn't Exist, Brandon, Brian and others here in just a moment.
[03:33:30.407 --> 03:33:32.389]  George Humphrey hasn't even seen the Obama Deception.
[03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:33.730]  He's been out of town.
[03:33:33.730 --> 03:33:34.510]  He's in the Obama Deception.
[03:33:34.510 --> 03:33:36.171]  He just popped into the office.
[03:33:36.171 --> 03:33:39.234]  Maybe I'll wrangle him into being in an Obama Deception 2 real quick.
[03:33:39.234 --> 03:33:40.875]  Quick interview.
[03:33:40.875 --> 03:33:43.096]  And I may have him pop in for a few minutes right here at the end of the show.
[03:33:43.096 --> 03:33:46.298]  I'm definitely going to have Dr. Scott Whitaker back on the show in the near future.
[03:33:46.298 --> 03:33:47.880]  We're about to go right back to him in a moment.
[03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:50.982]  First, some of the sponsors that I believe in that have made this radio show possible.
[03:33:52.148 --> 03:33:54.069]  The global is bringing us into a full-bore depression.
[03:33:54.069 --> 03:33:57.452]  Ninety-plus percent of people aren't self-sufficient.
[03:33:57.452 --> 03:33:59.994]  All hell is going to break loose.
[03:33:59.994 --> 03:34:03.497]  And so you need to get high-quality non-GMO grown right here in the U.S.

[03:34:37.714 --> 03:34:40.795]  And there's a war on against non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds.

[03:35:04.133 --> 03:35:05.954]  There's water in the air, folks.
[03:35:05.954 --> 03:35:09.836]  You don't have to drink it out of the tap of the fluoride or put it through a filter and hope it cuts it out.
[03:35:09.836 --> 03:35:12.438]  You grab it out of the water, no fluoride, no nothing.
[03:35:12.438 --> 03:35:16.060]  Goes through seven different filters after that.
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:17.480]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.

[03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:35.210]  Love the units.

[03:35:40.293 --> 03:35:46.476]  Doctor, I want to go to calls right now, but where is the best place for folks to get your book, Medicine?
[03:35:46.476 --> 03:35:47.917]  I've seen several websites with your book.
[03:35:51.024 --> 03:35:52.165]  www.medicines.net.
[03:35:52.165 --> 03:35:57.447]  That's M-E-D-I-S-I-N-S dot net.
[03:35:57.447 --> 03:36:00.209]  Medicines with an S dot net.
[03:36:00.209 --> 03:36:00.789]  Yes.
[03:36:00.789 --> 03:36:01.990]  Medicines dot net.
[03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:04.731]  We've got that up on the screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:36:04.731 --> 03:36:07.313]  You know, I think we're turning the corner.
[03:36:07.313 --> 03:36:10.895]  People are really starting to wake up now everywhere.
[03:36:10.895 --> 03:36:13.536]  There is a massive quickening happening.
[03:36:13.536 --> 03:36:18.619]  That's good news, but the establishment is moving in, jumping on us with both feet, trying to put us back in the box.
[03:36:19.844 --> 03:36:20.684]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[03:36:20.684 --> 03:36:21.384]  There's no doubt.
[03:36:21.384 --> 03:36:46.792]  They realize that through the internet, through your show, and other activists out there who are trying to awaken the population, and they have to shut that all off with agent provocateurs, silly movies, and silly TV shows to keep your mind on that stuff, which is really not... It's not really that...
[03:36:48.217 --> 03:36:49.678]  Entertainment, but detainment.
[03:36:49.678 --> 03:36:51.280]  It keeps you detained.
[03:36:51.280 --> 03:36:54.082]  So, uh, this stuff is very serious.
[03:36:54.082 --> 03:36:57.865]  They use mind control, uh, almost every day.
[03:36:57.865 --> 03:37:06.933]  I'm sure that, uh, people saw the movie, uh, Eagle Eye, uh, they could see that they can, uh, tap into your, uh, personal life at any time with just that cell phone.
[03:37:09.637 --> 03:37:10.218]  Absolutely.
[03:37:10.218 --> 03:37:17.905]  Let's go to phone call Scott in Maryland where they had machine gun point force 1,500 children to be vaccinated with no law.
[03:37:17.905 --> 03:37:20.468]  You're on the air, Scott.
[03:37:20.468 --> 03:37:21.429]  Hi.
[03:37:21.429 --> 03:37:26.534]  You know, I think the world is not so black and white as your guest is portraying it.
[03:37:26.534 --> 03:37:29.577]  I'm an oncologist and there's a 90% cure rate for
[03:37:31.465 --> 03:37:32.446]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:37:48.289 --> 03:37:50.871]  Let me just throw this out, doctor.
[03:37:50.871 --> 03:37:52.712]  Let me just throw this out to you.
[03:37:52.712 --> 03:37:56.655]  I know there are good doctors and good people, and we talked about that earlier, like my dad.
[03:37:56.655 --> 03:38:07.104]  The issue here is, we know with certain cancers, like testicular or prostate, that you have an 80-90% cure rate with those.
[03:38:07.104 --> 03:38:11.027]  I also know my grandmother went and had a CAT scan as a regular checkup.
[03:38:11.027 --> 03:38:12.889]  They said she had lung cancer.
[03:38:12.889 --> 03:38:15.030]  They cut her lung out and screwed her heart up and everything.
[03:38:15.911 --> 03:38:16.271]  Well, I just...
[03:38:42.898 --> 03:38:47.763]  For certain cancers, like testicular and lymphoma, they have an 80 and 90 percent cure rate.
[03:38:47.763 --> 03:38:51.066]  So just, not all cancers are untreatable.
[03:38:51.066 --> 03:38:58.353]  Solid tumor, malignancies, advanced metastatic, they have, basically, there's no known standard cure for that.
[03:38:58.353 --> 03:39:01.115]  So, you know, I'll give you that.
[03:39:01.115 --> 03:39:03.978]  The other thing is that I'm interested in integrative medicine.
[03:39:04.594 --> 03:39:09.958]  And Dr. Dean Ornish has a program for reversing heart disease with diet and exercise.
[03:39:09.958 --> 03:39:12.740]  Medicare is going to start paying for it in January 2010.
[03:39:12.740 --> 03:39:21.126]  And so I think there is some, you know, integrative medicine is coming to the fore in many circles.
[03:39:21.126 --> 03:39:23.027]  Because people are demanding it.
[03:39:23.027 --> 03:39:30.092]  Just like ten years ago, everybody started converting over to organic foods and the feds changed the standards where something doesn't have to be organic to say organic.
[03:39:30.092 --> 03:39:32.794]  We're trying to shut down, I mean, I agree that
[03:39:33.294 --> 03:39:40.401]  That a lot of doctors in regular medical science want to have a more holistic thing and look at other things.
[03:39:40.401 --> 03:39:43.764]  But I mean, the horror stories of malpractice and drugs.
[03:39:43.764 --> 03:39:46.567]  I mean, they know Prozac causes psychotic breaks.
[03:39:46.567 --> 03:39:47.968]  Why are they pushing it on kids?
[03:39:47.968 --> 03:39:52.753]  I mean, I know the eugenicists run the top of the thing.
[03:39:52.753 --> 03:39:56.236]  But I mean, you made some points, Dr. Whitaker.
[03:39:56.236 --> 03:39:58.178]  Dr. Whitaker, do you want to comment to the oncologist?
[03:39:59.744 --> 03:40:03.485]  Well, all he mentioned was testicular cancer, and what was the other one, lymphoma?
[03:40:03.485 --> 03:40:09.346]  I've done both of those, 100% cure rate, so I don't understand his point.
[03:40:09.346 --> 03:40:12.286]  I would like to see your statistics.
[03:40:12.286 --> 03:40:14.087]  I highly doubt that that's the case.
[03:40:14.087 --> 03:40:16.187]  I mean, have you done a controlled trial?
[03:40:16.187 --> 03:40:18.347]  Have you actually done a scientific study?
[03:40:18.347 --> 03:40:19.428]  You're behind that.
[03:40:19.428 --> 03:40:20.908]  You doubt it.
[03:40:20.908 --> 03:40:23.048]  You're the arrogant person, sir.
[03:40:23.048 --> 03:40:25.709]  I mean, I'm a researcher.
[03:40:25.709 --> 03:40:26.769]  Why would I have to doubt it?
[03:40:28.191 --> 03:40:29.752]  If you said you did that, I believe you.
[03:40:29.752 --> 03:40:31.773]  Well, I'm not doubting you.
[03:40:31.773 --> 03:40:33.974]  Well, I mean, I'd like you to publish your results.
[03:40:33.974 --> 03:40:43.400]  You know, I would like you to draw up a study so I can... Well, there are a lot of medical studies, though, about the power of different vitamins and minerals in plant extracts.
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:46.322]  I mean, that's out there.
[03:40:46.322 --> 03:40:52.105]  Yes, but there's a lot of synthetic vitamin studies that have been negative lately, and they've gotten most of the attention.
[03:40:52.105 --> 03:40:56.107]  Now, I'm interested in, you know, diet and
[03:40:57.652 --> 03:40:58.573]  I think
[03:41:16.466 --> 03:41:17.007]  I don't think so.
[03:41:31.411 --> 03:41:42.799]  They're sitting there with a nurse hooked into the health department asking my wife if we've got enough money or if I'm mean to her, not telling my wife this is a police interview and they're going to seize my new baby if my wife makes one wrong move.
[03:41:42.799 --> 03:41:45.501]  So I'm just saying the system is predatory.
[03:41:45.501 --> 03:41:48.783]  I'm not saying that the doctors individually are all bad.
[03:41:48.783 --> 03:41:53.526]  But any other comments to that, Scott?
[03:41:53.526 --> 03:41:54.907]  Well, I mean, I've had that training.
[03:41:54.907 --> 03:41:57.849]  Basically, you're looking for child abuse and it's not
[03:41:58.615 --> 03:42:01.157]  I mean, all in the guise of good intentions.
[03:42:01.157 --> 03:42:02.478]  So, I mean... Yeah, but it's not.
[03:42:02.478 --> 03:42:05.160]  They're not telling you you're in a police interview.
[03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:07.742]  That that's going directly... You know, look, it's a grid.
[03:42:07.742 --> 03:42:11.525]  I mean, have you read the studies where the Rockefellers figured out most cancer is viral?
[03:42:11.525 --> 03:42:13.126]  And they're a bunch of eugenicists?
[03:42:13.126 --> 03:42:14.327]  I mean, these people are psychos.
[03:42:14.327 --> 03:42:15.668]  I know what they're doing.
[03:42:15.668 --> 03:42:16.349]  We've proven that.
[03:42:18.103 --> 03:42:32.538]  Well, I have not read this particular... Why do you think all these children... As an oncologist, are you denying that there's now explosive juvenile diseases of cancers that never before was seen?
[03:42:34.278 --> 03:42:36.601]  You know, I'd have to go back to the Sears data on that.
[03:42:36.601 --> 03:42:46.295]  I'm not a pediatric oncologist, but I believe that the incidence of cancer has greatly increased since the 1940s.
[03:42:46.295 --> 03:42:50.000]  Now it's starting to decline in the last decade, but only a very small amount.
[03:42:50.561 --> 03:42:56.763]  But yeah, since the 1940s, there has been a large... Yeah, it's humped up and then planed off because of survivability in the statistics I've seen.
[03:42:56.763 --> 03:42:58.863]  I'm no doctor, I just read the medical journals.
[03:42:58.863 --> 03:42:59.663]  I read it all.
[03:42:59.663 --> 03:43:06.705]  But listen, Scott, send an email to robd at infowars.com, this deed ornished.
[03:43:06.705 --> 03:43:07.645]  We'll look into that.
[03:43:07.645 --> 03:43:10.526]  We have all views on here and I appreciate you holding.
[03:43:10.526 --> 03:43:12.047]  Thank you so much.
[03:43:12.047 --> 03:43:13.027]  Okay, thanks.
[03:43:13.027 --> 03:43:14.327]  Okay, that was Scott from Maryland.
[03:43:14.327 --> 03:43:16.368]  We go back to Dr. Scott Whitaker.
[03:43:18.427 --> 03:43:23.409]  I mean, that guy was not half as arrogant as most medical people are, was he?
[03:43:23.409 --> 03:43:30.071]  Well, you know, just the fact that he would immediately just blow mine off, it's like, oh, yeah, I doubt that, you know.
[03:43:30.071 --> 03:43:37.013]  He carries on with his jargon, but, you know, with them, everything has to be a scientific model.
[03:43:37.013 --> 03:43:43.855]  It's like they go to school, and if it doesn't fit into this certain box, then they don't believe it.
[03:43:43.855 --> 03:43:45.416]  Okay, well, here's a scientific model.
[03:43:47.554 --> 03:43:59.459]  I know with the Searle, owned by Monsanto, headed up by Rumsfeld, this is, I've read the actual scans of the reports, they fed it in the milk to the rhesus monkeys, and almost all of them died.
[03:43:59.459 --> 03:44:01.520]  I mean, it was killing them.
[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:08.723]  And then they still used that data and turned it around and got approval with payoffs in Congress for that.
[03:44:08.723 --> 03:44:09.983]  Oh, I'm sure.
[03:44:09.983 --> 03:44:15.186]  And you'll have the individuals like we just had who
[03:44:16.591 --> 03:44:26.233]  Well, I don't know if he's backing that up, but it's pretty crazy.
[03:44:26.233 --> 03:44:27.574]  Nathan in Las Vegas.
[03:44:27.574 --> 03:44:28.494]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[03:44:28.494 --> 03:44:30.434]  Welcome.
[03:44:30.434 --> 03:44:30.874]  How you doing?
[03:44:30.874 --> 03:44:34.875]  This is actually Nathan from Los Angeles, but it doesn't really matter.
[03:44:34.875 --> 03:44:36.376]  Okay, that's only Las Vegas, but go ahead.
[03:44:36.376 --> 03:44:45.858]  Well, anyways, yeah, I was calling because I had a question that I actually ran by a few people over the last year or so, but I never can get an answer.
[03:44:46.525 --> 03:44:49.849]  And I've done the research and I'm just baffled on this.
[03:44:49.849 --> 03:44:56.197]  What is... Does dental shots or tetanus shots carry anything that I should be worried about?
[03:44:56.197 --> 03:44:57.278]  Tetanus shots?
[03:44:57.278 --> 03:44:59.401]  It's been in mainstream newspapers.
[03:44:59.401 --> 03:45:03.346]  I've been... 10 years ago, 12 years ago, 5 years ago, I forget the exact...
[03:45:04.616 --> 03:45:14.025]  But I mean, mainstream European papers, you can pull this up, I've had medical doctors on, scores of them, basically saying what this naturopathic doctor is saying right now.
[03:45:14.025 --> 03:45:20.851]  But in India and Africa, major firms, universities, tested from multiple manufacturers.
[03:45:20.851 --> 03:45:23.593]  Okay, it wasn't an accident, a very expensive female hormone.
[03:45:24.474 --> 03:45:26.895]  Just had Montefon talking about it earlier this week.
[03:45:26.895 --> 03:45:28.516]  He's a medical doctor.
[03:45:28.516 --> 03:45:40.181]  And they tested it, and so you get an autoimmune response to the tetanus and to that hormone that's released at the start of the second trimester causing a violent miscarriage and autoimmune inflammation in the organ that releases the hormone.
[03:45:40.181 --> 03:45:44.043]  Would you like to speak to that, the tetanus shot?
[03:45:44.043 --> 03:45:44.603]  Oh, no doubt.
[03:45:44.603 --> 03:45:50.386]  It also is another form of causing infertility.
[03:45:51.578 --> 03:45:57.823]  It doesn't allow the egg to attach and causes many problems in women.
[03:45:57.823 --> 03:46:00.785]  The tetanus shot is very toxic.
[03:46:00.785 --> 03:46:02.586]  It contains mercury.
[03:46:02.586 --> 03:46:06.790]  So, you know, avoid it at all costs.
[03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:20.620]  People did back in the day, my grandma, what they did, if they ever punctured their foot with anything like that, they would just take a penny, put it at the puncture wound and draw the poison out.
[03:46:20.620 --> 03:46:21.281]  And that's what they did.
[03:46:21.724 --> 03:46:32.567]  Well, when I step on stuff, because I had a tetanus shot when I was little, but I've had puncture wounds, I just get a knife out, put it over the flame, and then just stick that sucker in there and get it bleeding.
[03:46:32.567 --> 03:46:38.428]  I guess people don't want to do that, but I just get it going and get it bleeding.
[03:46:38.428 --> 03:46:42.970]  For dental, I was trying to figure out, because everybody has to go to the dentist at some point.
[03:46:45.157 --> 03:46:53.505]  Well, you notice, you notice they're moving away from the mercury fillings now towards, uh, you know, the other composites that are basically a plastic.
[03:46:53.505 --> 03:46:58.050]  I guess specifically dental shop, you know, like the pain killers.
[03:46:58.050 --> 03:46:59.751]  Uh, you know what?
[03:46:59.751 --> 03:47:01.473]  I don't believe there's any mercury in the Novocaine.
[03:47:01.473 --> 03:47:02.294]  That's not a vaccine.
[03:47:02.294 --> 03:47:03.235]  That's just a drug.
[03:47:03.235 --> 03:47:05.157]  That's just a drug to deaden the nerve.
[03:47:05.157 --> 03:47:07.559]  But the dental profession also is, uh,
[03:47:08.464 --> 03:47:18.051]  No less evil than the American Medical Association because promoting fluoride and mercury and putting it in people's mouths is satanic at best.
[03:47:18.051 --> 03:47:23.154]  Oh yeah, I remember when I was a kid I'd get the fluoride wash and I'd get a huge headache afterwards.
[03:47:23.154 --> 03:47:24.475]  Thanks for the call Nathan.
[03:47:24.475 --> 03:47:26.957]  Doesn't exist in New Mexico.
[03:47:26.957 --> 03:47:27.758]  Interesting name.
[03:47:27.758 --> 03:47:30.159]  Go ahead, doesn't exist.
[03:47:30.159 --> 03:47:32.801]  Monsanto doesn't exist.
[03:47:32.801 --> 03:47:36.404]  Day after day I hear people denying the truth on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:37.642 --> 03:47:41.343]  Pontius Pilate asked the question, what is truth?
[03:47:41.343 --> 03:47:46.024]  People need to Google The Principle of Contradiction by St.
[03:47:46.024 --> 03:47:48.265]  Thomas Aquinas.
[03:47:48.265 --> 03:47:52.906]  Something can't exist and not exist at the same time.
[03:47:52.906 --> 03:48:00.768]  Also, Google The Letter... The Story of a Soul That Went to Hell.
[03:48:00.768 --> 03:48:01.608]  Hello?
[03:48:01.608 --> 03:48:02.488]  Yes, sir, we're listening to you.
[03:48:06.198 --> 03:48:08.560]  No, you're just talking about how the establishment denies everything.
[03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:12.463]  They're still saying, there's no compulsory service bill, Lindbeck says.
[03:48:12.463 --> 03:48:13.544]  There's no FEMA camps.
[03:48:13.544 --> 03:48:15.126]  Poplar Mechanics says so.
[03:48:15.126 --> 03:48:19.129]  I appreciate your call, when it's just everywhere in the mainstream media.
[03:48:19.129 --> 03:48:23.593]  I've got reports here of all these youth brigades.
[03:48:23.593 --> 03:48:28.617]  I've got this, the Army Civilian Police and Security Guard program that I've got to go through.
[03:48:28.617 --> 03:48:31.820]  I've got the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program.
[03:48:31.820 --> 03:48:34.202]  These are 24 camps with Americans in them right now.
[03:48:36.192 --> 03:48:40.755]  These are forced labor camps operating now and no one will, it's an army dot mil.
[03:48:40.755 --> 03:48:45.438]  Can you speak to just the level of denial we see out there, doctor?
[03:48:45.438 --> 03:48:47.899]  Oh yeah, big denial.
[03:48:47.899 --> 03:48:58.965]  I remember when the Katrina event happened, when that fiasco took place and FEMA came on board and so many families were broken up from that.
[03:48:58.965 --> 03:49:04.789]  Some they still can't find today and they set up concentration camps
[03:49:05.856 --> 03:49:09.618]  Uh, you know, they sent everybody to the, to the dome to be killed there.
[03:49:09.618 --> 03:49:14.561]  But luckily the, uh, the, the winds went the other way that, that roof didn't cave in.
[03:49:14.561 --> 03:49:20.244]  But, uh, these, uh, forces are always, like I said, they use in mind control.
[03:49:20.244 --> 03:49:24.146]  They use the media to, to, to, to manipulate thoughts.
[03:49:24.146 --> 03:49:28.108]  And then they, uh, have, they make you think that was there is not there.
[03:49:28.108 --> 03:49:28.828]  And it really is.
[03:49:29.683 --> 03:49:34.067]  I have a couple questions, one for each of you and a couple comments if time permits.
[03:49:34.067 --> 03:49:36.289]  My question first to Dr. Whitaker is, what
[03:49:59.465 --> 03:50:02.367]  What do you know about Lyme disease and its agenda and source?
[03:50:02.367 --> 03:50:14.314]  And Alex, what do you know of how it could fit into the globalist agenda?
[03:50:14.314 --> 03:50:16.295]  Well, I mean, we have Plum Island.
[03:50:16.295 --> 03:50:17.376]  We know it was leaked from there.
[03:50:17.376 --> 03:50:18.597]  Even mainstream news says that.
[03:50:18.597 --> 03:50:22.499]  It's a zoological experimental level 4 bio-weapons lab.
[03:50:22.499 --> 03:50:25.080]  They weaponized the Lyme disease.
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:25.601]  Go ahead, Doctor.
[03:50:26.491 --> 03:50:29.673]  Oh yeah, it's strange that the gentleman just asked that.
[03:50:29.673 --> 03:50:40.119]  I just picked up a Lyme disease client last week, and it's definitely a biological weapon.
[03:50:40.119 --> 03:50:48.464]  They promoted some tick landing on you and treating this problem, but that's not a problem that's treated by no tick.
[03:50:48.464 --> 03:50:53.867]  It's a biological weapon that destroys the nervous system, bacterium, and we've been using the
[03:50:59.196 --> 03:51:00.016]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:51:00.016 --> 03:51:01.017]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:51:01.017 --> 03:51:02.438]  George Humbert will pop into it.
[03:51:02.438 --> 03:51:05.200]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:09.643]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[03:51:09.643 --> 03:51:13.506]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[03:51:13.946 --> 03:51:16.127]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[03:51:16.127 --> 03:51:20.930]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[03:51:20.930 --> 03:51:27.834]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[03:51:27.834 --> 03:51:29.015]  One Florida customer says,
[03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:38.106]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[03:51:38.106 --> 03:51:42.749]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[03:51:42.749 --> 03:51:46.091]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[03:51:46.091 --> 03:51:52.716]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com, that's 9voltlite.com, or call us today toll free at 877-715-4448, that's 877-715-4448.
[03:51:59.761 --> 03:52:08.252]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.252 --> 03:52:09.394]  We've gotta give them a stake.
[03:52:09.873 --> 03:52:14.116]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.116 --> 03:52:20.620]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.620 --> 03:52:22.601]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.601 --> 03:52:25.062]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:25.062 --> 03:52:35.949]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.234 --> 03:52:39.915]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.915 --> 03:52:41.776]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.776 --> 03:52:48.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.680 --> 03:52:56.944]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.944 --> 03:52:58.505]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.505 --> 03:52:59.686]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.240 --> 03:53:07.103]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[03:53:07.103 --> 03:53:16.968]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataracts.
[03:53:17.088 --> 03:53:21.572]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[03:53:21.572 --> 03:53:28.677]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, can ease computer vision syndrome, and more.
[03:53:28.677 --> 03:53:34.462]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[03:53:34.542 --> 03:53:42.689]  With regular use, people using CAN-C drops report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days, and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[03:53:42.689 --> 03:54:00.525]  CAN-C, that's CAN dash letter C, is available now by calling 888-212-8871, that's 888-212-8871, or order online at Nutrimedical.com, that's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com, your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[03:54:09.164 --> 03:54:11.005]  I mean, take just Tuskegee Experiment.
[03:54:11.005 --> 03:54:14.807]  I hate to keep bringing up black folks, but in Maryland, they're forced to take the shots.
[03:54:14.807 --> 03:54:16.528]  That's where they're shipping the drugs in.
[03:54:16.528 --> 03:54:19.510]  They always do it there first, like Tony Brown says.
[03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:24.112]  The Tuskegee Experiment, not just letting them die of it, but spreading it and giving it to them.
[03:54:24.112 --> 03:54:28.074]  That went for 45 years until people exposed it.
[03:54:28.074 --> 03:54:30.256]  No, this is sinister at the top, and I want to...
[03:54:30.956 --> 03:54:34.857]  So we'll have to do a few minutes here with George Humphrey who just popped in right at the end.
[03:54:34.857 --> 03:54:40.919]  But Dr. Whitaker, we're definitely going to have you back on MetaSyn with an S on the end dot net.
[03:54:40.919 --> 03:54:44.560]  We'll have you back to finish up with the Lyme disease situation.
[03:54:44.560 --> 03:54:47.080]  Yes.
[03:54:47.080 --> 03:54:48.381]  Like I said, it's a biological weapon.
[03:54:48.381 --> 03:54:52.962]  It was made there on Plum Island there and goes back into the 40s.
[03:54:52.962 --> 03:54:57.904]  So yes, it could relate that to the Tuskegee experiment because that was during that time frame.
[03:54:57.904 --> 03:54:59.544]  And it's a bacterium.
[03:55:00.260 --> 03:55:03.942]  Uh, laboratory made, uh, destroys the nervous system.
[03:55:03.942 --> 03:55:09.986]  And like I said, we've, we've been using a chlorine dioxide to, uh, get the body back in shape with that.
[03:55:09.986 --> 03:55:13.748]  And a couple of nerving herbs to balance out the system as that person goes through that.
[03:55:13.748 --> 03:55:24.194]  But, uh, it's very, uh, debilitating when the person encounters it, uh, it's airborne and, uh, you know, it's, it's just another,
[03:55:25.167 --> 03:55:29.470]  Satanic weapon being used on the human population by these globalists.
[03:55:29.470 --> 03:55:32.271]  Well, Dr. Whitaker, we will talk to you again in the near future.
[03:55:32.271 --> 03:55:36.234]  Godspeed, and thank you for your endorsement of the Obama deception.
[03:55:36.234 --> 03:55:36.954]  No doubt about it.
[03:55:36.954 --> 03:55:39.836]  Thank you, Mr. Jones, and I'd love to be on your Part 2.
[03:55:40.965 --> 03:55:41.365]  Absolutely.
[03:55:41.365 --> 03:55:43.267]  We'll have you back on and again and again.
[03:55:43.267 --> 03:55:44.448]  Take care, my friend.
[03:55:44.448 --> 03:55:45.208]  Thank you.
[03:55:45.208 --> 03:55:50.572]  It's always great just discovering every day new freedom fighters who've been out there for years, reaching tens of thousands, if not millions of people.
[03:55:50.572 --> 03:55:54.815]  George Humphreys, one of them, author, lecturer, city councilman, degreed economist.
[03:55:54.815 --> 03:55:55.516]  You just agreed.
[03:55:56.016 --> 03:56:00.497]  Because you're always in California or India or Austin, all over the world, businessman.
[03:56:00.497 --> 03:56:00.957]  You're back.
[03:56:00.957 --> 03:56:02.437]  You hadn't seen the Obama Deception.
[03:56:02.437 --> 03:56:03.377]  You'd been gone for three weeks.
[03:56:03.377 --> 03:56:04.918]  Now it's been out for two weeks.
[03:56:04.918 --> 03:56:07.738]  You said you're hearing about it on the street and phone calls, folks seeing you in it.
[03:56:07.738 --> 03:56:08.899]  So you came by to get a copy here.
[03:56:08.899 --> 03:56:09.919]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[03:56:09.919 --> 03:56:10.519]  I came back.
[03:56:10.519 --> 03:56:11.679]  I've been out of touch.
[03:56:11.679 --> 03:56:16.120]  I haven't been looking at computers or listening to phone calls for about three weeks.
[03:56:16.120 --> 03:56:21.281]  I come in the other night, my phone is full of messages from people around the country saying,
[03:56:21.806 --> 03:56:24.348]  God, the Obama deception is fabulous!
[03:56:24.348 --> 03:56:26.069]  You know, I want to talk to you about it.
[03:56:26.069 --> 03:56:38.196]  So, I'm really happy, not only for you, because this is a very, very positive thing, but I'm very happy for the people of this country to be able to see through this thing.
[03:56:38.196 --> 03:56:45.080]  What we are facing is the most dangerous period in the history of not only our country, but of the Western culture.
[03:56:46.340 --> 03:56:49.881]  You know, this Obama, he's a real work of art.
[03:56:49.881 --> 03:56:59.004]  And the real danger of Obama is that he is so likable, is that he is so articulate, that he is so charismatic.
[03:56:59.004 --> 03:57:00.184]  He is a man of color.
[03:57:00.184 --> 03:57:02.104]  He's a very, very likable guy.
[03:57:04.358 --> 03:57:05.839]  That is the real danger.
[03:57:05.839 --> 03:57:13.685]  And as I say over and over and over again, you've got to judge a tree by its fruit, not by its flower.
[03:57:13.685 --> 03:57:14.786]  And his fruit is bad.
[03:57:14.786 --> 03:57:15.866]  And his fruit is bad.
[03:57:15.866 --> 03:57:20.149]  And I have all these friends who are good, good people.
[03:57:20.149 --> 03:57:22.611]  They're smart.
[03:57:22.611 --> 03:57:25.273]  And they keep going, well, I'm sticking with him.
[03:57:25.273 --> 03:57:26.154]  I'm sticking with him.
[03:57:26.154 --> 03:57:27.014]  I'm sticking with him.
[03:57:27.014 --> 03:57:33.199]  I'm going, look, you know, you were against Bush because of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan.
[03:57:34.679 --> 03:57:45.134]  Obama's for the war in Iraq, and for the war in Afghanistan, and he's for putting missiles in the Ukraine, in Poland, in Georgia, aimed at Russia.
[03:57:45.134 --> 03:57:47.156]  This guy is more militaristic
[03:57:48.640 --> 03:57:50.461]  Well, George, we're almost out of time.
[03:57:50.461 --> 03:57:53.083]  I just want to, since you're here for two weeks, I want to invite you in.
[03:57:53.083 --> 03:57:56.585]  Let's go check with my producer for an hour and a half next week in studio.
[03:57:56.585 --> 03:57:57.025]  Absolutely.
[03:57:57.025 --> 03:58:02.869]  But also, I'm going to come out to your house to interview with you there sometime for the new film where Megan Tarpley's coming in this weekend.
[03:58:02.869 --> 03:58:04.190]  He'll be with me in studio.
[03:58:05.230 --> 03:58:06.631]  from 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:06.631 --> 03:58:07.412]  this Sunday.
[03:58:07.412 --> 03:58:15.657]  Rebroadcast with all the amazing analysis and guests and a bunch of important info about them openly announcing how the European Union will govern the new planetary government.
[03:58:15.657 --> 03:58:18.179]  That is what Gordon Brown said on video.
[03:58:18.179 --> 03:58:22.902]  That was in the first hour that's in the rebroadcast at Infowars.com.
[03:58:22.902 --> 03:58:25.444]  But George, we got about 30 seconds till this show ends.
[03:58:25.444 --> 03:58:26.824]  It goes into rebroadcast.
[03:58:26.824 --> 03:58:27.525]  Say bye to folks.
[03:58:27.785 --> 03:58:35.151]  Alex, you're doing God's work, and every one of you who are listening, just wake up, talk with your friends, share the information.
[03:58:35.151 --> 03:58:37.953]  We created this problem, and we can heal it.
[03:58:37.953 --> 03:58:39.094]  God love you.
[03:58:39.094 --> 03:58:39.635]  Absolutely.
[03:58:39.635 --> 03:58:41.116]  There's George Humphrey in studio.
[03:58:41.116 --> 03:58:42.557]  I'll be with us next week.
[03:58:42.557 --> 03:58:47.421]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.616 --> 03:58:53.298]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.298 --> 03:58:58.045]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.045 --> 03:59:01.009]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.009 --> 03:59:04.053]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.053 --> 03:59:08.779]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:08.939 --> 03:59:09.279]  We're good to go.
