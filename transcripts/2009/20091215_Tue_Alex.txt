[00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:09.980]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.561]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.122]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.305]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:21.367]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:44.407]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Tuesday edition, the 15th day of December 2009.
[00:00:44.407 --> 00:00:48.348]  Here's the deal.
[00:00:48.348 --> 00:01:03.352]  I have a huge stack of vital information to cover today on every angle of the New World Order and what the hordes of criminals are doing through their corporate slash government
[00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.104]  Combines.
[00:01:07.104 --> 00:01:11.447]  And we're going to be covering it all today.
[00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:18.652]  We're also going to have wide-open phones throughout the full four hours.
[00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:19.432]  No guests today.
[00:01:19.432 --> 00:01:32.041]  In fact, we could have had some guests, but we shunted them aside for the day because I feel the calling of covering a ton of news, ranting about the New World Order, and taking your phone calls.
[00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:43.901]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:51.226]  And I really have gotten better when I do take calls actually going to them, but today I'm going to take a lot.
[00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:55.868]  So this is your chance to call in with your point that you'd like to make, but be ready!
[00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.751]  Be ready to make your point, because the only way to take calls is for
[00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:22.095]  You to be brief and for your host, myself, to be brief as well so we can get on to the next person and it will create quite a mental stir in all of us, very stimulating to have all these different points and angles and recesses of our planet being covered.
[00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:35.535]  I love spinning the wheel of fortune, reaching into the bag, the grab bag of callers, and having no idea what is going to be pulled forth from the maw.
[00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:36.876]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:38.437]  I have, of course, the military expansion news.
[00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:39.819]  Netanyahu talking about striking Iran.
[00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:52.715]  Another headline here, U.S.
[00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:58.119]  to expand drone attacks into Pakistan's cities.
[00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:05.965]  Imagine, just a foreign country flying over your nation saying, we don't need to declare war on you, we'll just bomb whoever we want randomly.
[00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:08.227]  And if we kill innocent people, so what?
[00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:12.890]  It's not terrorism when we do it.
[00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.872]  Meanwhile, they're only killing people that aren't paying their cut of opium money.
[00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:17.754]  They're not killing real Al-Qaeda or Taliban.
[00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:20.556]  You better believe they're on globalist payroll on record.
[00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.354]  Also, Al Gore's been caught in another big lie on the whole climate gate front.
[00:03:28.354 --> 00:03:40.043]  What I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna read headlines, and I've never been able to do this, not in all my years on radio, have I been able to just read the headlines and not stop and elaborate or comment on it.
[00:03:40.043 --> 00:03:48.389]  We shall see if I have developed, in 14 years of talk radio, finally the self-control to simply read headlines.
[00:03:49.847 --> 00:04:06.431]  I will give you a smattering of the headlines here, and then I will go to your phone calls and then detail all of this news throughout the broadcast day.
[00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.352]  But the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231 on this Tuesday, the 15th day of December 2009.
[00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:11.252]  Can you believe?
[00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:23.607]  There are only 15 days left in December.
[00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:41.019]  Can you believe that 2009, that seems like it just began this morning, is very long in the tooth and has a great ponderous white beard rolling down over old man's knees.
[00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:48.164]  As a new year, the baby prepares to secrete itself
[00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:59.269]  As the planet begins to engage in another revolution around the sun that Al Gore in the UN says has nothing to do with heat.
[00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:07.151]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:08.431]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.252]  It's very real.
[00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:13.133]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:17.615]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:20.196]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:25.978]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:30.985]  Their best-seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:33.808]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:36.532]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:43.702]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:47.727]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:47.968]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:49.910]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:04.448]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:05.369]  Number one.
[00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.792]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:09.653]  Number two.
[00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:14.538]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.538 --> 00:06:15.299]  It's true.
[00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:19.843]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.143 --> 00:06:20.964]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:24.547]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:28.470]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.271]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.033]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:35.716]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:35.937]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:40.641]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:45.705]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:49.869]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.670]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.274]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:05.559]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:14.422]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:19.043]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:29.867]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.507 --> 00:07:40.016]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:45.461]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:52.947]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.947 --> 00:07:55.710]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:00.888 --> 00:08:06.311]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.593]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:19.311]  We're going to go live, we're live on the radio right now, on this Tuesday, the 15th day of December, 2009 edition.
[00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:25.095]  We're going to simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv in the second, third, and fourth hour today.
[00:08:25.095 --> 00:08:40.706]  And when I start the second hour, I'm going to play several video clips of what members of the United Nations IPCC do at press conferences when accredited press asks them simple questions about Climategate.
[00:08:41.727 --> 00:09:02.772]  Now one of the same reporters who was grabbed and drug out for politely asking a question of one of the heads of the IPCC Friday, he has now gotten up to Al Gore and politely asked him about previous things Gore has said that have turned out to be false and Al Gore's goons just assaulting.
[00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:10.630]  These people are tyrants, and that is coming up later in the next hour.
[00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:17.894]  We will play those video clips for everyone and go over the true nature of these individuals.
[00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:29.282]  And I want to go back to the weekend, an article written for PrisonPlanet.com, furious reaction to sick editorial calling for global one-child policy dictatorship.
[00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:45.352]  This lady had agreed to do an interview that wrote the editorial for Canada's Financial Post and then actually backed out of the interview.
[00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:48.734]  But I want to go over that because we can't just let this die.
[00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:58.599]  The issue of China actually proposing at the
[00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:11.322]  Copenhagen event, the global government event, a global one-child policy, simultaneously with all these newspapers calling for the exact same thing.
[00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:14.563]  So that is going to be coming up later in the second hour.
[00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:25.548]  Let me just read over some of the headlines I have here, then I'm going to go to your calls throughout the four-hour broadcast today.
[00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:28.069]  Internet filter gets green light.
[00:10:28.936 --> 00:10:34.858]  The government is pushing ahead with its controversial plan to filter the internet with quote, Chinese-style censorship.
[00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:37.758]  That's in Australia.
[00:10:37.758 --> 00:10:42.580]  Democrats plan nearly $2 trillion debt limit hike.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.541]  Ron Paul warns that nightmare big government health care bill will pass.
[00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:53.482]  Obama's safe school czars tied to lewd readings for 7th graders.
[00:10:53.482 --> 00:10:55.343]  That's putting it lightly.
[00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.191]  The real reason behind the Copenhagen walkout.
[00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:07.493]  Supreme Court ruling means torture could return.
[00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:12.975]  If Climategate is no big deal, why are questions about it met with an armed response?
[00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:21.137]  Again, I mentioned that it dovetails with the latest assault on this gentleman for daring to ask questions of any of the globalists.
[00:11:26.095 --> 00:11:33.298]  On the subject of Climategate, African states end climate talks boycott.
[00:11:33.298 --> 00:11:43.463]  That was yesterday that for a few hours they staged a little walkout saying, look, this massively cuts our industrial base.
[00:11:43.463 --> 00:11:45.624]  The media's spinning it that, no, they want more money.
[00:11:45.624 --> 00:11:46.744]  No, that's not what it is.
[00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:49.366]  They've actually read what we've been talking about for a week and a half.
[00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:58.627]  The actual treaty that hasn't even been brought publicly forward yet, but is available, stating that the cuts are meant to destroy their industrial base.
[00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:03.245]  Deadlock threatens Copenhagen climate deal.
[00:12:03.245 --> 00:12:03.946]  That's today.
[00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:05.547]  So the deadlock is real.
[00:12:05.547 --> 00:12:07.528]  The walkout is continuing.
[00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:11.031]  China-India walkout on climate talks.
[00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:17.615]  Climate treaty would create new global agencies to transfer money and technology from U.S.
[00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:19.176]  and other developed countries to third world.
[00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:20.657]  That's not really true.
[00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:28.242]  It transfers them to the IMF and World Bank in their colonization operation.
[00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:36.645]  Also, Gore has said that ice may vanish in five to seven years.
[00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:38.026]  Yes.
[00:12:38.026 --> 00:12:43.307]  And a giant asteroid from Gobbledygook might strike the planet.
[00:12:43.307 --> 00:12:53.571]  And blood-drinking vampiric toads might crawl out of it and begin feeding us into blenders and making smoothies out of us.
[00:12:53.571 --> 00:12:56.492]  I mean, that could happen.
[00:12:56.492 --> 00:12:58.552]  But it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[00:12:58.552 --> 00:13:00.073]  Maybe one out of 50 trillion.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.361]  It's just completely made up.
[00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:10.108]  Remember, Al Gore three years ago said that by 2009 the ice caps are going to completely melt.
[00:13:10.108 --> 00:13:11.829]  It didn't happen.
[00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:21.718]  They aim cameras at glaciers that always run out to the sea and in the spring always break off and fall into the water and they fear monger and tell everyone that the world is ending.
[00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.600]  That's coming up.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.621]  And he got caught lying.
[00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:27.524]  Times of London, the scientists who actually put out the report,
[00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:29.940]  is saying that that's not what he said.
[00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:49.887]  Access to H1N1 vaccine easing as interest in shot wanes.
[00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:51.548]  Yeah, people won't take it.
[00:13:51.548 --> 00:14:02.832]  So they tried to create the artificial scarcity model to get everybody to panic and run out and try to get it like the latest wind-up gerbil or cabbage patch doll or turbo doll.
[00:14:02.832 --> 00:14:06.333]  And we even had the CFR bragging, that's what they did.
[00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:07.793]  A big report from Sybil Edmonds.
[00:14:07.793 --> 00:14:11.074]  It's up on Infowars.com from Boiling Frogs.
[00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:15.636]  Secret reports, secret budgets, secret operations, secret courts, a secret government.
[00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.614]  So we'll be breaking some of that down.
[00:14:21.614 --> 00:14:30.465]  On the war issue, adviser trashes Blair over Iraq, calls him a sycophant to Washington.
[00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:41.390]  Meanwhile, the same sycophant gave a speech saying we must set up a global government and set up global taxes or we're all basically dead.
[00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.913]  And that's coming up later in the broadcast as well.
[00:14:43.913 --> 00:14:45.654]  Continuing on the war front, U.S.
[00:14:45.654 --> 00:14:55.985]  to expand drone attacks into Pakistan cities, Times of London, Benjamin Netanyahu must decide whether to strike Iran's nuclear facilities and is deciding right now.
[00:14:57.384 --> 00:14:57.684]  U.S.
[00:14:57.684 --> 00:14:59.746]  needs to tame debt soon.
[00:14:59.746 --> 00:15:06.870]  Experts say, Reuters, and the experts are all calling for a value-added tax and sales tax and income tax boost.
[00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.453]  And Obama agrees, and so do the Republicans, that we must have it.
[00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:15.176]  So see, and now Glenn Beck and everybody's saying we must have new taxes.
[00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:16.917]  And you're a communist if you're against them.
[00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:18.998]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:15:18.998 --> 00:15:21.600]  Don't let the liberals stop you from taxes.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.821]  Be conservative.
[00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.102]  Salute Mao Zedong.
[00:15:25.979 --> 00:15:31.840]  Everything is the opposite of reality with these people.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:50.005]  How about we not let the government that tripled under Bush and more than quadrupled in the first year under Obama, more than all presidents before him combined, $4 trillion deficit this year and growing, more than all presidents before him combined, with interest.
[00:15:53.527 --> 00:16:01.454]  And don't worry, I'm now a liberal, a commie, because I'm against increasing taxes.
[00:16:01.454 --> 00:16:03.116]  See, the public's all about labels now.
[00:16:03.116 --> 00:16:11.223]  You tell them, turning your guns in, drinking deadly fluoride to brain damage and sterilize yourself is conservative.
[00:16:11.223 --> 00:16:14.806]  Wearing Che Guevara t-shirts is conservative.
[00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:19.891]  You'd see conservatives all running around in Che Guevara t-shirts, because they call it conservative.
[00:16:21.343 --> 00:16:26.749]  And now Glenn Beck, as usual, shows himself, along with Bill O'Reilly, wanting new taxes that we have to have.
[00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:28.571]  The liberals don't want it.
[00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:33.978]  Oh, well, if you don't want to be thrown in the Breyer patch, I'll be sure and throw you in there.
[00:16:33.978 --> 00:16:36.561]  Well, that's exactly where Breyer Rabbit wants to go.
[00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.403]  You ever read the tale of Breyer Rabbit?
[00:16:40.322 --> 00:16:41.804]  And the Briar Patch?
[00:16:41.804 --> 00:16:44.468]  Hey guys, I bet Wikipedia has a rundown of it.
[00:16:44.468 --> 00:16:48.113]  The story of Briar Rabbit and the Briar Patch.
[00:16:48.113 --> 00:16:49.855]  Will you search that and pull it up for me?
[00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:51.478]  I want to get the character straight.
[00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:55.644]  I remember my dad reading that story to me several times when I was a little kid.
[00:16:57.714 --> 00:17:01.155]  And explaining to me how people try to manipulate others.
[00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:03.976]  I didn't really understand it at the time.
[00:17:03.976 --> 00:17:08.057]  Boy, I wish I learned all those lessons when I was young, but I guess you've got to go through it.
[00:17:08.057 --> 00:17:15.699]  Even though your parents try to warn you, try to teach you, you just have to experience it for yourself, don't you?
[00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:24.202]  Okay, that's just some of the news that I have in front of me today.
[00:17:26.584 --> 00:17:29.326]  But what I'm going to do is I'm going to suspend covering news for now.
[00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:33.969]  I'm going to play all those video clips and cover the news starting in the second hour today.
[00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:36.110]  But let's begin by going to your phone calls.
[00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.431]  Rick in Florida, first up.
[00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.572]  Welcome.
[00:17:38.572 --> 00:17:41.274]  Alex, it's a pleasure and an honor to talk to you, sir.
[00:17:41.274 --> 00:17:43.275]  Thanks for waking me up.
[00:17:43.275 --> 00:17:55.263]  Listen, I'm a beginning 9-11 truth activist, and I would, this morning, try to watch loose change in American coup, but YouTube is blocking parts four and five.
[00:17:56.021 --> 00:17:58.929]  Could you explain why they're doing that?
[00:17:58.929 --> 00:18:01.195]  And I also want to ask you...
[00:18:01.983 --> 00:18:09.068]  Can you update us on the 9-11 Truth Movement, the New York City Can Initiative, where do we stand, and what's our next move?
[00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:12.590]  Okay, let me answer that for you.
[00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:20.896]  I produced, because they asked for my help, Loose Change Final Cut, and we have that film available at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:27.501]  Loose Change American Coup has a nice voiceover by Daniel Sinjada, but really it's the first chapters that were cut out of
[00:18:30.063 --> 00:18:33.785]  With a few interviews, and I think it's fine and dandy, but I have nothing to do with that.
[00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:37.948]  I have nothing to do with that.
[00:18:37.948 --> 00:18:47.033]  I know that, against my wishes, some of the parties involved with loose change, final cut, did not want it free on the internet.
[00:18:47.033 --> 00:18:47.813]  I did.
[00:18:47.813 --> 00:18:49.274]  And lobbied for it to be free.
[00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:50.575]  So I would imagine that their
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.581]  Taking those down, but I don't know.
[00:18:54.581 --> 00:18:56.501]  I mean, that's their decision.
[00:18:56.501 --> 00:18:59.222]  Um, that's why I tend to just make my own films.
[00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:05.124]  I've, I've, because it's good to just be, that's why you don't see my films in stores.
[00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:14.287]  I, uh, put a few films in stores, a few previous films, and then was pressured to not have them available free.
[00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:22.782]  I went back and reviewed and showed people the contracts that I had stipulated that I could still offer them for free.
[00:19:22.782 --> 00:19:30.386]  But I've turned down deals with Universal Studios wanting to put my films out and offering me big amounts of money.
[00:19:30.386 --> 00:19:36.849]  You know, more money than I've ever made put together in one year.
[00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:42.092]  And I said no because I want to be able to offer them for free.
[00:19:42.092 --> 00:19:44.253]  You won't run into many people that can turn down
[00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:51.320]  Millions of dollars on the contract.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.821]  But I did.
[00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:55.743]  Because having the films for free is what matters.
[00:19:55.743 --> 00:20:00.866]  That's why my films are all free on the internet.
[00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:01.546]  Hello.
[00:20:01.546 --> 00:20:06.289]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:11.112]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:20:11.112 --> 00:20:11.712]  Here's a small
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.163]  That's all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:20:16.163 --> 00:20:20.827]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:20:20.827 --> 00:20:25.051]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:20:25.051 --> 00:20:29.414]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:20:29.414 --> 00:20:33.978]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:20:33.978 --> 00:20:35.860]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.202]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:20:38.202 --> 00:20:40.104]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:20:40.104 --> 00:20:45.829]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:49.232]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:20:49.232 --> 00:20:52.835]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:56.839]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:21:00.686 --> 00:21:02.867]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.867 --> 00:21:03.708]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:04.048]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.048 --> 00:21:09.091]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.091 --> 00:21:10.711]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:11.472]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.472 --> 00:21:11.872]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:12.973]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.973 --> 00:21:15.934]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:19.816]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:22.678]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:25.559]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:27.140]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:27.440]  Right!
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.762]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.762 --> 00:21:31.343]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.343 --> 00:21:32.683]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.683 --> 00:21:36.545]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:40.327]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:40.327 --> 00:21:45.490]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.392]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:48.872 --> 00:21:50.634]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:50.634 --> 00:21:54.919]  Try startpage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:54.919 --> 00:21:56.521]  That's startpage.com.
[00:22:00.609 --> 00:22:07.274]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.274 --> 00:22:15.400]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.964]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:22:21.304 --> 00:22:23.546]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:23.546 --> 00:22:28.650]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:33.874]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:38.217]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.217 --> 00:22:39.318]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:43.341]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:48.706]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.706 --> 00:22:51.709]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:53.470]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.751]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:54.371]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.733]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[00:23:06.365 --> 00:23:11.208]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[00:23:11.208 --> 00:23:16.892]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[00:23:16.892 --> 00:23:19.353]  Patriotfood.com.
[00:23:19.353 --> 00:23:24.457]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[00:23:24.457 --> 00:23:29.200]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[00:23:30.203 --> 00:23:36.588]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[00:23:36.588 --> 00:23:40.611]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[00:23:40.611 --> 00:23:46.996]  That's over four pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[00:23:46.996 --> 00:23:51.340]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.663]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:23:55.663 --> 00:23:58.185]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[00:24:24.324 --> 00:24:32.588]  Let's continue with phone calls.
[00:24:32.588 --> 00:24:35.969]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in New York.
[00:24:35.969 --> 00:24:36.769]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:38.190]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.371]  This is a pleasure.
[00:24:39.371 --> 00:24:41.531]  It's my first time getting through.
[00:24:41.531 --> 00:24:41.832]  Welcome.
[00:24:43.914 --> 00:24:47.495]  You've been talking about the war drum being beat, and it is.
[00:24:47.495 --> 00:24:52.977]  I want to bring to your attention three articles that have been penned today.
[00:24:52.977 --> 00:25:04.980]  The head neocon, William Kristol, he penned an article in the December 21st issue of the Weekly Standard.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.481]  It's a Nobel War speech that Obama laid the groundwork for a strike against Iran.
[00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:15.420]  Yes, the neocons are all praising Obama, but of course they are.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.762]  He's funded by the exact same Wall Street banks that funded them.
[00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:21.662]  He kept the same Secretary of Defense.
[00:25:21.662 --> 00:25:24.803]  It's just a huge, sickening betrayal and joke.
[00:25:24.803 --> 00:25:30.105]  But dumb liberals get to feel like they're in power, so now they love war and death and banker raping.
[00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:31.846]  And that's why they're going to lose everything they've got.
[00:25:31.846 --> 00:25:38.208]  And then when a Republican gets in office, Republicans won't care if they're corrupt and bad, because they get to feel like they're winners.
[00:25:39.128 --> 00:25:42.852]  And part of the power structure, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:25:42.852 --> 00:26:02.672]  And also, a congresswoman, Eileen Ross-Lehtian, of Florida penned, Hit Iran Where It Hurts, and as well as in the London Times, I believe it was, the article is, Secret Documents Exposes Iran's Nuclear Trigger.
[00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:26.529]  Yeah, just like there were secret documents with Iraq and the nukes that could destroy Europe in 15 minutes or 45 minutes could hit the US or England and yellow cake from Niger and WMDs and passports magically fall out of the towers and are found by the FBI, two of them proving that Al Qaeda hit us on 9-11 and if you believe that,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.360]  I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.761]  Good to hear from you, Joe.
[00:26:30.761 --> 00:26:32.541]  Yeah, they're beating the war drums.
[00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:33.802]  Tracy in New Mexico.
[00:26:33.802 --> 00:26:34.462]  You're on the air.
[00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:35.662]  Go ahead.
[00:26:35.662 --> 00:26:37.323]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:37.323 --> 00:26:37.583]  Hi.
[00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:38.643]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:26:38.643 --> 00:26:40.624]  Listen, it's been a while.
[00:26:40.624 --> 00:26:46.065]  I've talked to you a couple of times, but I think now's the time to ask.
[00:26:46.065 --> 00:26:50.247]  I don't even know if you know or not, but is there a group
[00:26:55.129 --> 00:27:01.919]  Are there people anywhere, we seem to think there's millions who know what we know and believe what we believe.
[00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:02.860]  There are.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:11.813]  Well, I want to, I need a contact number, a contact point, an email, a website, something
[00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:13.533]  Sure, sure.
[00:27:13.533 --> 00:27:19.119]  For about three years, I've been trying just to get my operation built up, to have a big enough office to be set up.
[00:27:28.157 --> 00:27:36.681]  To where I can set up a proper type of kind of meetup for people that love freedom and hate tyranny.
[00:27:36.681 --> 00:27:39.642]  And we are working on that now.
[00:27:39.642 --> 00:27:54.128]  But the biggest thing, sir, is if you just wear anti-New World Order t-shirts, if you just walk around the streets of where you live, if you start a local website and, you know, call it Patriot News slash your town,
[00:27:56.024 --> 00:28:04.831]  I mean, if you do something like that, it will be an unstoppable force in your area, and that's how you're going to meet like-minded people.
[00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:11.516]  I get hundreds of emails a day, no exaggeration, asking me to be a matchmaker for people.
[00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:19.803]  I mean, I don't know my neighbors too well, much less who you're going to be hooking up with, so I can't play the part of matchmaker.
[00:28:20.962 --> 00:28:24.504]  Let's know after all this time and with what's going on.
[00:28:24.504 --> 00:28:25.445]  Build it!
[00:28:25.445 --> 00:28:26.885]  Tracy, how about you build it?
[00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:30.427]  We'll link to it.
[00:28:30.427 --> 00:28:38.692]  Well, anytime one guy goes out to do something, unless he's a you, he ends with the SWAT team kicking his door in some morning.
[00:28:38.692 --> 00:28:39.032]  Really?
[00:28:39.032 --> 00:28:40.353]  I haven't found that.
[00:28:40.353 --> 00:28:42.014]  I haven't found that.
[00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:43.655]  Well, it's not going to be you.
[00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:47.197]  I mean, we outnumber the New World Order 1,000 to 1.
[00:28:47.197 --> 00:28:50.379]  Most people I've seen that have gotten started against the Globalists have had great success.
[00:28:51.724 --> 00:28:56.306]  I don't think they're omnipresent, and the average cop is waking up as well.
[00:28:56.306 --> 00:29:00.307]  But listen, I appreciate your call, Tracy, and I hear your point.
[00:29:00.307 --> 00:29:07.129]  And I'm going to work even harder, not because it is my job responsibility, but because nobody else is doing it, to make sure that happens.
[00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:13.552]  And I've got a bunch of ideas, and I've just got to put them into place, and I've got to crack some whips around here to get it done.
[00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:15.052]  Believe me.
[00:29:15.052 --> 00:29:16.853]  Believe me.
[00:29:16.853 --> 00:29:17.953]  And I am cracking the whip.
[00:29:20.811 --> 00:29:27.532]  Everybody then critiques me and says, well Alex needs to do this, well Alex needs to do that.
[00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:29.072]  I'm trying as best I can.
[00:29:29.072 --> 00:29:31.413]  Sir, you're not going to save the world by yourself.
[00:29:31.413 --> 00:29:34.333]  You're not going to find any perfect silver bullet.
[00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:46.116]  Okay, and then I say we'll start a local website, just a local news site, with a Liberty perspective, and you'll start getting emails and contacts.
[00:29:46.116 --> 00:29:47.276]  Go out and have a rally.
[00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:48.636]  You'll meet like-minded people.
[00:29:50.962 --> 00:29:54.891]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:57.577]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:05.766]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:08.987]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.987 --> 00:30:13.789]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:20.191]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:22.432]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.972 --> 00:30:23.272]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.272 --> 00:30:23.792]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:24.452]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.452 --> 00:30:25.733]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.733 --> 00:30:27.973]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.877 --> 00:30:46.238]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.238 --> 00:30:49.139]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:58.262]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.916 --> 00:31:03.918]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.918 --> 00:31:09.263]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.263 --> 00:31:11.304]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.304 --> 00:31:16.308]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:17.229]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.489 --> 00:31:18.610]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.491]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.491 --> 00:31:21.572]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.572 --> 00:31:23.774]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.774 --> 00:31:25.115]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:25.115 --> 00:31:26.636]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.636 --> 00:31:31.900]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.483]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.483 --> 00:31:38.966]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.306 --> 00:31:40.526]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:41.427]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.427 --> 00:31:42.527]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.527 --> 00:31:43.467]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:44.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.568 --> 00:31:47.609]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:31:59.873 --> 00:32:06.838]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:32:06.838 --> 00:32:08.119]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:08.939]  It's very real.

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.921]  Alex Jones, this is Brenton, Colorado.
[00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:09.802]  When are you going to have the Infowarrior dating internet website?
[00:33:09.802 --> 00:33:12.163]  Us Infowarriors, we need to reproduce, man.
[00:33:17.804 --> 00:33:20.886]  Yes, yes.
[00:33:20.886 --> 00:33:32.092]  I am planning to set up a system where you've got meetups for groups, organizations, dating the whole nine yards.
[00:33:32.092 --> 00:33:33.773]  But I gotta crack the whip around here.
[00:33:33.773 --> 00:33:36.094]  We gotta get focused on the projects.
[00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.588]  And you know, I'm finally getting my new studio built.
[00:33:40.588 --> 00:33:45.211]  I built this studio in the last year, but an even bigger studio.
[00:33:45.211 --> 00:33:48.693]  I finally got super awesome bandwidth in here.
[00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:54.217]  Hey, Matt, what's the bandwidth that we have now?
[00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:58.000]  I know it's 60 megabits a second.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.442]  It's a fiber optic cable.
[00:34:00.442 --> 00:34:02.983]  Big around is your thumb.
[00:34:02.983 --> 00:34:06.286]  I'm told that's pretty powerful.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:06.686]  What's that?
[00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.982]  I know, but the cable it's in is big.
[00:34:12.982 --> 00:34:16.823]  Is that all just guarding the human hair?
[00:34:16.823 --> 00:34:18.544]  So there's a bunch of fibers.
[00:34:18.544 --> 00:34:19.344]  So I was right.
[00:34:19.344 --> 00:34:21.465]  The cable coming in here is as big around as your thumb.
[00:34:21.465 --> 00:34:23.806]  Or bigger.
[00:34:23.806 --> 00:34:25.986]  I know I can look at the cable and tell you it's big.
[00:34:25.986 --> 00:34:28.127]  So how many fiber optics are there in there?
[00:34:28.127 --> 00:34:34.029]  40 or more.
[00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:39.091]  Boy, I tell you, we had to twist some arms and pay some money to get them to string that in here and put that in here.
[00:34:40.691 --> 00:34:43.592]  Because Time Warner said, oh, you can have all the Roadrunner cable you want.
[00:34:43.592 --> 00:34:44.453]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:44.453 --> 00:34:47.374]  And as soon as we moved in here, oh, we're not going to give that to you.
[00:34:47.374 --> 00:34:50.856]  No, no one, no one can have that on your street.
[00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:57.839]  So we were in here running off DSLs and T1s, a nightmare.
[00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:03.122]  A whole bunch of them coming in here, but now we have Death Star level bandwidth.
[00:35:03.122 --> 00:35:03.802]  And I love it.
[00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:11.711]  I mean, when you're really grassroots and you really build it all yourself and you really do it all, it's hard.
[00:35:11.711 --> 00:35:12.852]  And I get these calls.
[00:35:12.852 --> 00:35:19.478]  Believe me, four years ago, I knew we needed social networking.
[00:35:19.478 --> 00:35:24.202]  Three years ago, I started trying to put that plan into function, but making films,
[00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.731]  Writing the articles, setting up the radio interviews.
[00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:30.652]  I mean, you just run out of time.
[00:35:30.652 --> 00:35:38.155]  And I get call after call after call after call after call saying, Alex, you need to do this.
[00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:40.816]  You need to do that.
[00:35:40.816 --> 00:35:48.919]  And I'll guarantee you, when I do set up social networking, it's going to say on there, at your own risk, because there's no way that
[00:35:51.932 --> 00:35:53.633]  It's going to be completely safe.
[00:35:53.633 --> 00:35:55.034]  Nothing is on the internet.
[00:35:55.034 --> 00:35:59.137]  Nothing is in real life.
[00:35:59.137 --> 00:36:01.339]  And I guarantee you, people are going to complain.
[00:36:01.339 --> 00:36:04.681]  I met this guy on your website and he's a jerk!
[00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:06.663]  How dare you!
[00:36:06.663 --> 00:36:08.024]  But look, I understand that.
[00:36:08.024 --> 00:36:15.910]  Criticism doesn't bother me, other than the fact it bothers me that you criticize what we're doing when we are the leaders.
[00:36:19.025 --> 00:36:23.527]  That isn't saying much, but we're the leaders in taking action.
[00:36:23.527 --> 00:36:39.192]  I mean, earlier I talked about how I have had several big distribution deals where I was sought out by major distributors, where it wasn't some made-up Hollywood deal.
[00:36:39.192 --> 00:36:46.395]  Most stuff in Hollywood or in entertainment is a bunch of people around a table promising each other the moon, and then none of it happens 99% of the time.
[00:36:49.565 --> 00:37:01.310]  But no, I mean, I've had, on paper, more money than I have ever made combined, wanting to buy up my entire catalog of films,
[00:37:02.901 --> 00:37:04.442]  And put them in stores.
[00:37:04.442 --> 00:37:11.005]  And I knew that Ventura had been paid $3 million a year for a three-year contract on MSNBC.
[00:37:11.005 --> 00:37:12.286]  He thought it was a great deal.
[00:37:12.286 --> 00:37:16.788]  He signed it, but it said for the three years he couldn't do any other media unless they said.
[00:37:16.788 --> 00:37:19.029]  Then they laughed at him and said, you're not going on TV.
[00:37:19.029 --> 00:37:20.450]  We know you're anti-war.
[00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.072]  This is basically meant to shut you down.
[00:37:23.072 --> 00:37:31.356]  So when I saw something like that, I said, hmm, millions of dollars to not be able to get my films out free on the internet.
[00:37:34.229 --> 00:37:40.093]  I mean, I could literally be in Maui right now in a mansion out there paddling around with my children.
[00:37:40.093 --> 00:37:41.895]  They would certainly like it a lot better.
[00:37:41.895 --> 00:37:49.140]  But no, instead I'm here.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.363]  And I'm doing it my way.
[00:37:52.363 --> 00:37:55.025]  And believe me, the establishment doesn't like it.
[00:37:55.025 --> 00:38:00.829]  But I have been approached over and over and over again to sell out.
[00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:18.499]  I mean, in this case, I even told you that I was approached by Universal, their documentary division, and said, yeah, we want to buy your whole catalog.
[00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:21.301]  And it was just a super good deal, too.
[00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:24.864]  And, you know, it wasn't them even trying to buy me off, probably.
[00:38:24.864 --> 00:38:29.729]  It was just, oh, these are popular films, we'll repackage these, we'll sell them, we'll put them out.
[00:38:31.835 --> 00:38:34.997]  And it was the best deal I ever got offered.
[00:38:34.997 --> 00:38:37.019]  50% of profit.
[00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:37.799]  50!
[00:38:37.799 --> 00:38:39.420]  Had the lawyers look at it.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.682]  They said, this contract is the best thing we've ever seen.
[00:38:42.682 --> 00:38:44.464]  Best thing since sliced bread.
[00:38:44.464 --> 00:38:50.488]  I said, no.
[00:38:50.488 --> 00:38:57.072]  Now, for all you talkers out there, you ever turn down $2 million, $3 million, $5 million?
[00:38:57.072 --> 00:38:58.874]  You ever turn down a check for $5 million?
[00:39:02.281 --> 00:39:05.383]  You ever done that?
[00:39:05.383 --> 00:39:14.047]  You ever had major corporations offering you the moon and really can deliver it?
[00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:16.728]  Can you turn it down?
[00:39:16.728 --> 00:39:19.110]  Would you turn it down?
[00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:27.374]  So that you could give your videos out for free and be screamed at and hated in the process knowing that it was doing the right thing?
[00:39:27.374 --> 00:39:28.855]  I said I'm going back to your calls and I am.
[00:39:30.256 --> 00:39:34.439]  It's just that subject gets brought up of documentaries and films.
[00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:36.601]  We're changing the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:37.862]  That's what I want to do.
[00:39:37.862 --> 00:39:40.324]  I want a better future for humanity.
[00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:43.446]  And that's why the establishment hates me.
[00:39:43.446 --> 00:39:50.471]  And that's why they try to pull me down through their COINTELPRO and say I'm not real.
[00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:57.877]  Because they know that if you model after what I've done and know that I am real and that you are real and that we can affect change together,
[00:39:59.434 --> 00:40:15.347]  And that if we discover we have power, and that we can have victory, and that people learn that there are really heroes alive in the world, you're looking at one in the mirror, look in the mirror, that's gonna be the hero, you decide, you, you're it, you're all we've got.
[00:40:15.347 --> 00:40:23.554]  The big secret is, it's not even hard to turn down all that money.
[00:40:25.453 --> 00:40:40.141]  Once you've stepped through to the other side of liberty and patriotism and freedom and telling the truth and being honorable, they could literally offer me a billion dollars and I wouldn't even think about selling out.
[00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:46.165]  I've been offered TV show after TV show after TV show.
[00:40:46.165 --> 00:40:51.788]  And I don't mean Hollywood fakes calling up and offering me television shows.
[00:40:53.257 --> 00:40:57.699]  I don't mean talk, I mean contracts.
[00:40:57.699 --> 00:41:03.983]  And I've said no because I wouldn't have creative control over it.
[00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:11.487]  I've said no because it's, oh, we're going to offer you a show where you investigate Bigfoot and you get two million dollars a year.
[00:41:11.487 --> 00:41:12.267]  How does that sound?
[00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:14.869]  We're ready to do this right now.
[00:41:14.869 --> 00:41:16.790]  And that is a way to torpedo what I've done.
[00:41:18.507 --> 00:41:20.048]  Oh yeah, Alex Jones, he was good.
[00:41:20.048 --> 00:41:21.469]  He was fighting the New World Order.
[00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:22.890]  He was fighting the private banks.
[00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:31.354]  But now, he's that big star on TV that investigates ghosts and goblins and hauntings and Bigfoot.
[00:41:31.354 --> 00:41:45.182]  I've been offered millions on paper to walk away from all this and go live in Beverly Hills and leave all of the FBI-infested patriot movement to chew each other's guts out.
[00:41:45.182 --> 00:41:47.704]  And the establishment can't stand it that I've never taken the bait.
[00:41:50.046 --> 00:41:51.207]  So what do they do?
[00:41:51.207 --> 00:41:56.591]  They have COINTELPRO come out and lie and say, Genesis is owned by ABC.
[00:41:56.591 --> 00:41:58.332]  Total lie!
[00:41:58.332 --> 00:42:04.116]  It's like if you drive a Ford car, it's saying you are Henry Ford.
[00:42:04.116 --> 00:42:08.479]  And wrote the International Jew.
[00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:10.661]  Because of out of the five satellites we've leased,
[00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:13.397]  One of them was an ABC satellite.
[00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.758]  How do you think you get to radio stations?
[00:42:15.758 --> 00:42:17.679]  How do you think your cell phone talks to somebody?
[00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:21.460]  If you're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, how do you think you talk to somebody in New York City?
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.080]  It's cheap!
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.041]  It's down to like a thousand bucks now.
[00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.841]  It was five thousand a few years ago.
[00:42:25.841 --> 00:42:28.462]  Any of you could call.
[00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:35.724]  And anyone could go, I'll even give my COINTELPRO enemies ideas, you could go and go, oh no, look, he's on all these satellites now.
[00:42:37.537 --> 00:42:38.678]  What does it even matter?
[00:42:38.678 --> 00:42:41.459]  What matters is my message is true.
[00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:43.340]  The information is powerful.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.362]  The information is accurate.
[00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.843]  The information is authoritative.
[00:42:47.843 --> 00:42:51.105]  The information teaches you that you have power.
[00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:55.767]  Believe me, the establishment doesn't want you to know that.
[00:42:55.767 --> 00:43:00.810]  Anyone with a thimble of discernment knows this radio show is the real deal.
[00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.352]  But then there are lies that have no basis in reality.
[00:43:05.486 --> 00:43:11.869]  They have people come out and say, oh, some Saudi Arabian owns Genesis.
[00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:14.109]  Complete, total lie!
[00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:16.690]  Get emails every day saying you must answer for this.
[00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.972]  Answer for what?
[00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:22.253]  Totally made up!
[00:43:22.253 --> 00:43:27.215]  They say on the internet that Ted Anderson owns some porno magazine called Genesis.
[00:43:27.215 --> 00:43:30.136]  Why should I respond to a complete lie?
[00:43:30.136 --> 00:43:33.597]  It says on the internet I'm a billionaire industrialist from Canada.
[00:43:33.597 --> 00:43:34.178]  Not true.
[00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.218]  Why should I respond to it?
[00:43:37.878 --> 00:43:42.741]  Because there's a 50-something-year-old guy with Scientology named Alex Jones?
[00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:45.162]  I am that man, they say.
[00:43:45.162 --> 00:43:48.103]  I'm not, but it doesn't matter.
[00:43:48.103 --> 00:43:54.727]  Websites say I have a radio show with the New York Times, or write for the New York Times, a radio show on NPR.
[00:43:54.727 --> 00:43:56.168]  It's not true?
[00:43:56.168 --> 00:43:56.748]  So what?
[00:43:56.748 --> 00:44:02.811]  People say it.
[00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:03.952]  People lie.
[00:44:03.952 --> 00:44:05.393]  They lie incessantly.
[00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:10.222]  And we've tracked it back to government operatives in most cases.
[00:44:10.222 --> 00:44:14.624]  Because they don't want you to have any faith.
[00:44:14.624 --> 00:44:21.186]  They want you to think if you start a local community website, standing up for freedom and liberty, that you're going to be SWAT teamed.
[00:44:21.186 --> 00:44:21.726]  When you're not.
[00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:26.728]  99% chance.
[00:44:26.728 --> 00:44:30.429]  You will definitely live under tyranny if you don't stand up though.
[00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:40.854]  See, because if I can stand up, if I can be for real, if I can stand up and make headway against the New World Order, then we must have hope!
[00:44:40.854 --> 00:44:43.795]  Humanity might be able to make a stand against this tyranny.
[00:44:43.795 --> 00:44:59.441]  But, if the establishment can put out that I'm a Fed, or I work for the Catholic Church, or I work for the Israelis, or I work for Scientologist, or I work for this or that... If the Feds can put that out,
[00:45:01.394 --> 00:45:03.395]  And we have federal manuals.
[00:45:03.395 --> 00:45:05.635]  We have the COINTELPRO manuals.
[00:45:05.635 --> 00:45:07.676]  We have what the Southern Poverty Law Center's been caught doing.
[00:45:07.676 --> 00:45:10.517]  We know they do this.
[00:45:10.517 --> 00:45:16.359]  We have army manuals of how they do this in third world countries.
[00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:21.160]  But the good news is it's not working because people have become wise to it.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.201]  But I will say this again.
[00:45:23.201 --> 00:45:25.121]  I can't start all the websites.
[00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:26.862]  I can't do everything for you.
[00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:31.689]  Don't use Alex Jones as an excuse for not standing up.
[00:45:31.689 --> 00:45:46.479]  That either, A, I'm going to save you, or B, if I just did things right, I could save you, or C, I'm a fed, so you need to just sit there in your apartment or your house and do nothing.
[00:45:46.479 --> 00:45:50.062]  Okay, let's just say I am the ultimate evil.
[00:45:50.062 --> 00:45:51.323]  I am the creature from hell.
[00:45:52.759 --> 00:45:55.060]  I am the creature from the Black Lagoon.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.100]  I'm the thing that hides under your bed at night.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.841]  I am horrible.
[00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:06.043]  Let's just establish that I'm horrible, that I am the worst creature on the planet.
[00:46:06.043 --> 00:46:09.384]  Let's just establish it.
[00:46:09.384 --> 00:46:13.305]  Let's just establish it for everybody.
[00:46:13.305 --> 00:46:13.565]  Okay?
[00:46:15.345 --> 00:46:18.289]  What are you going to do about auditing and abolishing the Federal Reserve?
[00:46:18.289 --> 00:46:21.613]  What are you going to do about stopping the government from attacking Iran?
[00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:23.635]  And telling them you don't want that to happen?
[00:46:23.635 --> 00:46:25.057]  And starting World War III?
[00:46:25.057 --> 00:46:26.018]  What are you going to do?
[00:46:27.964 --> 00:46:31.925]  To get them to not start World War III with the Russians, which they've been trying to do with 888.
[00:46:31.925 --> 00:46:35.406]  What are you going to do to get fluoride out of your local water supply?
[00:46:35.406 --> 00:46:51.769]  Fluoride, the catch-all term, for over 150 chemicals, at the minimum, the maximum over 300, that city water supplies add to the water that you drink under the name of dental health.
[00:46:51.769 --> 00:46:55.030]  When all the studies show sterilization in all mammal species.
[00:46:57.236 --> 00:47:04.819]  Reduced infertility, or increased infertility, and sterilization.
[00:47:04.819 --> 00:47:06.740]  I mean, that's the subject.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:20.807]  See, you don't want to face it, though, and the establishment understands the lazy mind, the drugged out mind, the chemicalized mind, people that want to rationalize, people that want to make excuses, people that don't have faith in themselves, people that don't imagine themselves as leaders.
[00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:51.069]  And so see, if you can just spend all your time saying Alex Jones is bad, and Alex Jones is evil, or if you can conversely just say it's one group that runs everything and one group that's evil, and then obsess over that all day and attack everyone who doesn't only spend their time attacking one group, if you can do that, you've got people divided and conquered.
[00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:52.030]  What I want to do now is
[00:47:54.963 --> 00:47:57.347]  I want to play some of the audio clips.
[00:48:02.475 --> 00:48:11.460]  I want to play some of the questions that have been coming in the last few days to the listener comment line, and then I'll comment on these in this segment and the next.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:20.224]  And then I'm going to continue with Bill, Kevin, Annie, Hartwell, Lynn, and others on the other side as we start the next hour.
[00:48:20.224 --> 00:48:27.408]  And then I'm going to break down all the latest financial news, climate gate news, police state news, war news, government takeover of health care news.
[00:48:32.488 --> 00:48:34.650]  But let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:38.554]  Here it is.
[00:48:38.554 --> 00:48:40.976]  Hey Alex, it's James from New York.
[00:48:40.976 --> 00:48:50.184]  Apparently they are going to be forcing this bloody climate legislation down our throats, whether we like it or not.
[00:48:50.184 --> 00:48:53.187]  Is there any way that we can find out what the heck these people are on?
[00:48:53.187 --> 00:48:55.409]  Because obviously they don't care about us.
[00:48:55.409 --> 00:48:58.772]  I mean, they're shoving it down our throats.
[00:49:00.168 --> 00:49:02.189]  Well, actually, if you were breathing 50%
[00:49:30.913 --> 00:49:35.175]  Carbon dioxide, it wouldn't hurt you, as long as you were getting the rest in oxygen.
[00:49:35.175 --> 00:49:49.402]  I mean, human trace amounts of carbon dioxide that we put off is what, one two thousandth, or less than one two thousandth, is the numbers I saw.
[00:49:49.402 --> 00:49:57.866]  I mean, it's just so ridiculous when you know basic science, but I have an article here where the IPCC has ruled the sun has, quote, no effect on climate change.
[00:49:59.301 --> 00:50:05.705]  I mean, that's as ridiculous as saying water has nothing to do with the ocean.
[00:50:05.705 --> 00:50:17.253]  I mean, it's just... And yes, the EPA rules that arsenic and cyanide in your water is okay, and that melamine is good for babies.
[00:50:17.253 --> 00:50:23.277]  Not just bad for them, or not just okay, it's good for them.
[00:50:23.277 --> 00:50:24.098]  So does the FDA.
[00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:34.779]  And yes, they said that, of course, their internal report said this is deadly poison, asbestos, concrete, glass, all these other chemicals.
[00:50:34.779 --> 00:50:42.266]  But they said, tell the public it's good, and they said, Sieg Heil!
[00:50:42.266 --> 00:50:46.130]  You got a bunch of psychopathic criminals running the system.
[00:50:47.205 --> 00:50:56.161]  You've got a nation of childlike fools that think they're important and powerful waddling around having no idea just how serious things are.
[00:50:56.161 --> 00:50:58.865]  We'll come back, play some more clips, comment on the listener line.
[00:51:01.212 --> 00:51:04.573]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:51:04.573 --> 00:51:08.494]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:51:08.494 --> 00:51:12.216]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:51:12.216 --> 00:51:19.718]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:51:19.758 --> 00:51:20.058]  I think so.
[00:51:45.445 --> 00:51:49.827]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:49.827 --> 00:51:51.948]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:51.948 --> 00:51:53.828]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:14.293]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.293 --> 00:52:20.679]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:26.224]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.224 --> 00:52:35.873]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.973 --> 00:52:38.315]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.315 --> 00:52:39.896]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.896 --> 00:52:42.378]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.378 --> 00:52:44.479]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.479 --> 00:52:49.643]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.643 --> 00:52:54.647]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:54.647 --> 00:52:58.830]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:04.232 --> 00:53:08.773]  Healthy Hearts Club presents Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:08.773 --> 00:53:11.194]  Supports clean, clear arteries.
[00:53:11.194 --> 00:53:13.075]  Healthy blood pressure levels.
[00:53:13.075 --> 00:53:15.256]  Healthy circulation and blood flow.
[00:53:15.256 --> 00:53:17.436]  Regular heart rate and beat.
[00:53:17.436 --> 00:53:20.017]  What if you could avoid heart attacks?
[00:53:20.017 --> 00:53:23.378]  What if you could avoid emergency room visits?
[00:53:23.378 --> 00:53:25.899]  What if you could avoid surgery?
[00:53:25.899 --> 00:53:26.499]  How?
[00:53:26.499 --> 00:53:27.499]  With this.
[00:53:27.499 --> 00:53:29.340]  Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.801]  100% organic.
[00:53:30.801 --> 00:53:32.121]  No negative side effects.
[00:53:32.681 --> 00:53:33.081]  I think so.
[00:54:10.218 --> 00:54:23.982]  Alex, I want to know why it is not mentioned anywhere that if health care, they want to control the cost of health care or any other care, that they're measuring the cost in Federal Reserve notes.
[00:54:23.982 --> 00:54:27.883]  And if the Federal Reserve note is collapsing, how could they lower the cost of anything?
[00:54:27.883 --> 00:54:30.984]  I just wish they would.
[00:54:31.778 --> 00:54:34.319]  Announce that out there, Alex, or you can announce it.
[00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:40.180]  If the Federal Reserve note collapses, they can't lower the cost of anything, and it drives me nuts.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.960]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.081]  Well, thank you, and that's a good point.
[00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:49.401]  It's all a fraud.
[00:54:49.401 --> 00:54:56.963]  See, when you hit the final stages of looting, that's why Bush tripled government in eight years, and Obama
[00:54:59.608 --> 00:55:03.771]  Close to quadrupled that in less than a year.
[00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:07.594]  So, more money than all presidents combined.
[00:55:07.594 --> 00:55:14.939]  43 presidents, back to George Washington.
[00:55:14.939 --> 00:55:24.766]  Obama spends more than George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush's daddy, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon.
[00:55:28.203 --> 00:55:48.335]  LBJ, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Harry Truman, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, all the way back through Lincoln and Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson.
[00:55:48.335 --> 00:55:51.597]  All presidents combined.
[00:55:51.597 --> 00:55:56.019]  He did that eight months, eight and a half months in.
[00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:56.700]  Now we're
[00:55:58.223 --> 00:56:00.545]  Eleven months in.
[00:56:00.545 --> 00:56:02.607]  About to be a year in.
[00:56:02.607 --> 00:56:07.991]  January 21st.
[00:56:07.991 --> 00:56:25.765]  See, you're hearing that they're federalizing all local police forces, the average cop hadn't been told yet, and they're face scanning you everywhere you go, and they're using spy satellites to track citizens, and that they're building prisons everywhere, because that's all that's going to be left.
[00:56:25.765 --> 00:56:27.647]  We're going into the worst kind of bondage.
[00:56:30.259 --> 00:56:33.003]  So of course you're not going to get Medicare or Medicaid.
[00:56:33.003 --> 00:56:35.666]  Of course you're not going to get your Social Security.
[00:56:35.666 --> 00:56:38.950]  We're going to be like Argentina when they're done.
[00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:45.379]  And your taxes, 90% of it, this is how it works for the IMF and World Bank, will go on interest to banks.
[00:56:47.452 --> 00:56:51.756]  And then they're going to get you even more debt where you default and they just fully take over everything.
[00:56:51.756 --> 00:56:54.418]  And that's already happening with the national parks and the ports.
[00:56:54.418 --> 00:57:00.404]  And remember a couple of years ago with Dubai World about to get 26 ports and Bush said, look, we got to give it to them.
[00:57:00.404 --> 00:57:01.645]  They own our dollars.
[00:57:01.645 --> 00:57:04.147]  This is all we got left.
[00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:10.573]  They took the greatest inventing nation, the greatest savings nation, the most wealthy nation on earth.
[00:57:10.573 --> 00:57:12.655]  And we're now the greatest debtor nation in 50 years.
[00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:15.632]  That's living under the bankers.
[00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:18.112]  And listen, the good times are gone.
[00:57:18.112 --> 00:57:19.453]  You think stuff's bad now?
[00:57:19.453 --> 00:57:22.614]  Just wait.
[00:57:22.614 --> 00:57:37.959]  And the mind control is so great, they're going to tell everybody that the economy is wonderful, as it gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:57:40.748 --> 00:57:44.309]  Because the bankers are in control.
[00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:47.770]  And no one will stop them, no one will speak out against them.
[00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.551]  People still only care about Dallas Cowboys.
[00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:54.791]  They don't know what a private Federal Reserve is.
[00:57:54.791 --> 00:58:05.454]  They don't understand that we are literally in the grip of absolute ruthless criminals who openly admit they're criminals and admit they've set up a paramilitary NORTHCOM police force to suppress the people.
[00:58:08.246 --> 00:58:11.909]  I mean, this is an organized criminal heist!
[00:58:11.909 --> 00:58:21.856]  And the cops just salute whoever's got a higher level marking on their uniform.
[00:58:21.856 --> 00:58:25.238]  We're a very evil country.
[00:58:25.238 --> 00:58:28.761]  The nation is very decadent and slob-like, and that's why we're being taken.
[00:58:29.605 --> 00:58:30.905]  We're an easy target.
[00:58:30.905 --> 00:58:33.506]  We're limp-wristed, pot-bellied ninnies.
[00:58:33.506 --> 00:58:35.927]  A bunch of spoiled, decadent fools.
[00:58:35.927 --> 00:58:36.947]  And it's over.
[00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:38.467]  We're gonna get hurt real bad.
[00:58:38.467 --> 00:58:39.228]  You understand?
[00:58:39.228 --> 00:58:42.468]  Real bad.
[00:58:42.468 --> 00:58:45.849]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.481 --> 00:58:55.788]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.788 --> 00:59:00.314]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.314 --> 00:59:02.597]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.597 --> 00:59:04.219]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:04.219 --> 00:59:05.261]  There is a solution.

[00:59:53.644 --> 00:59:56.045]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.045 --> 01:00:05.431]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:06.731]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:08.512]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.512 --> 01:00:10.273]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.834]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:12.775]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:17.598]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:21.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.417 --> 01:00:26.979]  When I talk about our nation being decadent, we really are.
[01:00:26.979 --> 01:00:27.860]  And that's on average.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.542]  There's still a lot of wonderful people in this country.
[01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:37.305]  But you look at Mexico, you look at North Korea, those people individually are smart, hardworking.
[01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:49.811]  But they have a slave attitude of putting up with corruption, thinking corruption's cute, going along with the system, and so they are completely enslaved.
[01:00:49.811 --> 01:00:54.033]  And now we're going to be slaves, unless we have an awakening.
[01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:57.294]  And there isn't much time left.
[01:00:57.294 --> 01:01:02.076]  And a lot of you like tyranny and think it's cute, so you're gonna get hurt by it.
[01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:07.518]  So am I. You need to know, though, that the banks have irrevocably robbed us.
[01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:17.009]  We can only arrest the bankers, declare the debt a fraud, go through the political pain and financial pain of that, or go into complete bondage.
[01:01:17.009 --> 01:01:25.912]  It'd be like if somebody had kidnapped you and was chaining you up to torture you to death, and I've read accounts where women finally fought back and escaped.
[01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:31.194]  A lot of times women get a gun pulled on them, they get put in a car, finally when they see they're going to get tortured to death,
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.881]  They finally fight back and get free.
[01:01:33.881 --> 01:01:43.768]  And now they're untying your arms and threatening you with a big knife and about to put you in handcuffs and if they get you strapped up to the wall, you're dead.
[01:01:43.768 --> 01:01:50.192]  And you're in a basement, there's some dead bodies hanging up on meat hooks around you.
[01:01:50.192 --> 01:01:53.395]  You can see where the globalists have killed people worldwide and taken over.
[01:01:53.395 --> 01:01:55.176]  They brag about how they're going to kill you.
[01:01:55.176 --> 01:01:56.437]  They're telling you they're going to kill you.
[01:01:56.437 --> 01:01:58.938]  They're telling you they're going to rape you and hurt you.
[01:01:58.938 --> 01:02:00.900]  And are you going to just sit there and timidly take it?
[01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:03.191]  A lot of you feel like you're part of it.
[01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:07.732]  You have kind of the Munchausen syndrome.
[01:02:07.732 --> 01:02:08.772]  Am I getting that mixed up?
[01:02:08.772 --> 01:02:11.153]  Is it Munchausen by proxy?
[01:02:11.153 --> 01:02:16.275]  What's the one they found where people get kidnapped or taken captive like Patty Hearst?
[01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.522]  Actually came out, she was a fed.
[01:02:18.522 --> 01:02:19.102]  I predicted that.
[01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:19.903]  It's been declassified.
[01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.584]  Now that was all staged.
[01:02:21.584 --> 01:02:25.427]  But a lot of them get kidnapped and then they end up joining the evil.
[01:02:25.427 --> 01:02:27.549]  And that's what it is with the cops and the military.
[01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:30.571]  I mean, they're scared to death of it at a subconscious level.
[01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:36.435]  And their subconscious mind makes the split-second calculation to join the evil.
[01:02:36.435 --> 01:02:41.879]  Craig, will you pull up Moonshousin by proxy?
[01:02:41.879 --> 01:02:46.283]  I may be mixing that up with the one where women hurt their kids to get attention.
[01:02:46.283 --> 01:02:46.443]  What?
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.841]  Yeah, it's Munchausen by proxy.
[01:02:50.841 --> 01:02:51.861]  Yeah, that's where they hurt their kids.
[01:02:51.861 --> 01:02:53.982]  What's the Stockholm Syndrome?
[01:02:53.982 --> 01:02:55.403]  Stockholm Syndrome is what it's called.
[01:02:55.403 --> 01:02:57.803]  I knew I was getting it wrong.
[01:02:57.803 --> 01:02:58.484]  I do that a lot.
[01:02:58.484 --> 01:03:00.204]  I get things backwards or twisted around.
[01:03:00.204 --> 01:03:02.565]  But then my brain's telling me, no, that's wrong.
[01:03:02.565 --> 01:03:03.265]  Error.
[01:03:03.265 --> 01:03:04.686]  Error, HAL 9000.
[01:03:04.686 --> 01:03:05.106]  Error.
[01:03:05.106 --> 01:03:05.846]  Error.
[01:03:05.846 --> 01:03:06.766]  Error.
[01:03:06.766 --> 01:03:08.907]  And oh, yes.
[01:03:08.907 --> 01:03:09.527]  Just a moment.
[01:03:09.527 --> 01:03:11.268]  Just a moment.
[01:03:11.268 --> 01:03:13.829]  Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:14.769]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:03:16.607 --> 01:03:18.148]  Okay, let's go to another call here.
[01:03:18.148 --> 01:03:20.149]  I'm just getting warmed up.
[01:03:20.149 --> 01:03:21.429]  Let's talk to Bill in Vegas.
[01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:23.110]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:23.590]  Hey, Alex.
[01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:27.713]  You know, you got me terrified of attacking space toads now.
[01:03:27.713 --> 01:03:30.154]  Well, if we don't pay Al Gore a tax, it's over.
[01:03:30.154 --> 01:03:31.074]  Yes.
[01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:31.975]  What are we going to do?
[01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.435]  But listen, I got into a debate.
[01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:40.239]  Speaking of lies that have no basis in reality, I got into a debate with a local radio host here in Vegas on the air about 9-11.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.341]  And he was just telling all kinds of ridiculous lies.
[01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:49.504]  He's saying that Silverstein, when he said, pull it, he was referring to cables that were holding up Building 7 because it was leaning over.
[01:03:49.504 --> 01:03:55.307]  And he was saying that the film was sped up on Building 7 and saying it like it's fact.
[01:03:55.307 --> 01:03:59.749]  By the way, NIST admits that it did fall at freefall speed.
[01:03:59.749 --> 01:04:01.670]  Not that, I mean, also he was lying.
[01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:02.930]  He's a liar.
[01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:03.370]  Right.
[01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:08.893]  And then he said, this is why I'm calling, because he said, when your name came up, he said that you were caught three times
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.562]  Using phony people as witnesses from the Pentagon who claim to work at the Pentagon during 9-11.
[01:04:15.562 --> 01:04:16.602]  And I didn't know what to say to him.
[01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:18.362]  Now I want to call back this New World Order property.
[01:04:18.362 --> 01:04:20.143]  Well that's just totally made up.
[01:04:20.143 --> 01:04:21.363]  I don't even know what he's talking about.
[01:04:21.363 --> 01:04:23.624]  It's completely made up.
[01:04:23.624 --> 01:04:27.465]  I want to call him back on Saturday and tell him, you know, I spoke to you personally and it's a crock.
[01:04:28.851 --> 01:04:31.533]  Well, there have been straw men, Bill.
[01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:55.189]  Now that I think about it, there was one guy who claimed he was a taxi driver who saw some things, and he was a taxi driver there, and we interviewed him, and then later he recanted under threats, so I guess that could be... I mean, we've certainly investigated a lot of things, some of it didn't pan out, but... I mean, does he really believe not one, but two passports fell out of the North and South Tower unburned and were both found by the FBI in the first day?
[01:04:56.816 --> 01:05:00.558]  I mean, if he believes that, he believes in blood-drinking space toads.
[01:05:00.558 --> 01:05:05.101]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.021]  Number one.
[01:05:06.021 --> 01:05:09.443]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.443 --> 01:05:10.304]  Number two.
[01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:15.186]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.186 --> 01:05:15.947]  It's true.
[01:05:15.947 --> 01:05:20.810]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:21.270]  Number three.
[01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:25.213]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:29.937]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.937 --> 01:05:32.699]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.699 --> 01:05:36.021]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:41.306]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.306 --> 01:05:46.351]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.351 --> 01:05:50.535]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.535 --> 01:05:52.317]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.317 --> 01:05:56.922]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.052 --> 01:06:04.074]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:04.074 --> 01:06:09.397]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.397 --> 01:06:11.438]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:16.441]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.441 --> 01:06:17.621]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:18.762]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.762 --> 01:06:20.643]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:21.724]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.724 --> 01:06:23.905]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.905 --> 01:06:25.266]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.266 --> 01:06:26.786]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.786 --> 01:06:27.827]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:29.308]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:06:29.308 --> 01:06:32.031]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:32.031 --> 01:06:35.635]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.635 --> 01:06:39.439]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.439 --> 01:06:40.681]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.681 --> 01:06:41.582]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:42.683]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.683 --> 01:06:43.624]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:44.425]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.705 --> 01:06:47.747]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:47.747 --> 01:06:49.989]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.989 --> 01:06:50.950]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.106 --> 01:07:05.412]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:07:05.412 --> 01:07:09.937]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:07:09.937 --> 01:07:12.220]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.842]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:07:13.842 --> 01:07:14.883]  There is a solution.
[01:07:15.103 --> 01:07:23.528]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:07:23.528 --> 01:07:30.992]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:07:37.035 --> 01:07:42.618]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:47.181]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:07:47.181 --> 01:07:51.584]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.

[01:08:02.052 --> 01:08:07.575]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.488 --> 01:08:15.051]  Alright, I'm going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:15.051 --> 01:08:23.496]  And I'm going to go to Kevin, Annie, Hartwell, Lynn, Andrew, and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:23.496 --> 01:08:31.441]  There have been a lot of big developments on the global government establishment front with the Copenhagen situation.
[01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.482]  We'll be breaking that down.
[01:08:33.482 --> 01:08:35.624]  Also, I want to, once we're live on television,
[01:08:36.633 --> 01:08:39.836]  And I can give you audio play-by-play for radio listeners.
[01:08:39.836 --> 01:08:47.462]  I want to play several video clips of what Al Gore's UN thugs do when anyone dare try to talk to him.
[01:08:47.462 --> 01:08:49.263]  They just grab your microphone away.
[01:08:49.263 --> 01:08:51.245]  It doesn't matter if you're at a press conference.
[01:08:51.245 --> 01:08:53.106]  It doesn't matter if you're a member of the press.
[01:08:53.106 --> 01:08:56.709]  It doesn't matter if you try to talk to the IPCC.
[01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:58.030]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:58.030 --> 01:09:01.673]  You do not criticize them or they run up and grab you.
[01:09:01.673 --> 01:09:03.875]  I mean, this is worse than Communist China.
[01:09:06.513 --> 01:09:18.085]  Press is allowed to go to communist Chinese press conferences, but if you do criticize the government or do something, they just revoke your visa and kick you out of the country.
[01:09:18.085 --> 01:09:18.806]  But rarely!
[01:09:18.806 --> 01:09:19.207]  They allow...
[01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:31.096]  I've got an article here where Australia, in their own words, has now, remember they started the test a year ago to see if it would work, they're installing Chinese-style net censorship.
[01:09:31.096 --> 01:09:37.223]  And I remember reading the original policy report, it was to, quote, shut down anti-globalization groups.
[01:09:37.223 --> 01:09:40.847]  They tell the public it's about keeping kids safe from porn.
[01:09:40.847 --> 01:09:41.688]  And the government
[01:09:42.665 --> 01:09:47.348]  Says that groups complain, and then you get banned and blocked out nationwide.
[01:09:47.348 --> 01:09:51.730]  And they're saying, oh, it's being looked at in England, and Europe, and the US, and Canada now.
[01:09:53.683 --> 01:10:00.567]  And they're putting in the NSA hubs to carry out the censorship and saying they may do it within one year.
[01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:09.851]  Remember a few months ago Obama said he may shut down the web during crises to make sure only accurate info gets out to the people, Associated Press.
[01:10:09.851 --> 01:10:14.334]  Ron Paul last Friday here said he really thinks they plan to shut the web down.
[01:10:14.334 --> 01:10:15.755]  That's a quote.
[01:10:15.755 --> 01:10:20.437]  He says they are planning to shut it down because he knows how to read what they are saying.
[01:10:20.437 --> 01:10:21.918]  They are broaching it!
[01:10:23.809 --> 01:10:27.390]  The average person's like, oh no, they'd never do that.
[01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.691]  Yeah, they'd never pass the hate crime legislation, would they?
[01:10:29.691 --> 01:10:33.572]  Either.
[01:10:33.572 --> 01:10:36.213]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:10:36.213 --> 01:10:42.515]  I want to go to your phone calls, but once a month, Marty Schachter of Calvin Pierce Soap Company pops in for five, six minutes with us.
[01:10:42.515 --> 01:10:46.076]  And I wanted to talk to Marty, since he got back from World War II in the Chemical Corps.
[01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:48.517]  He, um...
[01:10:49.938 --> 01:10:52.179]  Notice that there was no more real soap on the store shelves.
[01:10:52.179 --> 01:10:58.783]  When he got back to Oakland, California, he started Calvin Pierce Soap with his daddy, and now his son and his son run it.
[01:10:58.783 --> 01:11:15.232]  62 years later, coming up on 63 years, and you could never buy it until, what, five, six years ago when he became a Genesis sponsor, because it was only factory direct, mainly to the rich and famous, and to institutions that are smart.
[01:11:15.232 --> 01:11:16.733]  You don't think David Rockefeller
[01:11:17.932 --> 01:11:21.576]  Bathes in detergent, toxic waste distillates.
[01:11:21.576 --> 01:11:23.598]  No.
[01:11:23.598 --> 01:11:30.145]  And so you can get the finest organic soap and pay 85% off what you'd pay for for toxic waste.
[01:11:30.145 --> 01:11:30.946]  See, that's how it works.
[01:11:31.878 --> 01:11:32.578]  Well, thank you Alex.
[01:11:32.578 --> 01:11:33.899]  It's always a pleasure talking to you.
[01:11:33.899 --> 01:11:36.119]  Even though I'm going to have to wait a year to talk to you again.
[01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:04.183]  But you and the listeners have been so wonderful to us.
[01:12:04.183 --> 01:12:11.987]  The phone calls, the orders, the compliments, they come in every day and it's been fantastic.
[01:12:11.987 --> 01:12:15.588]  I'd like to make a suggestion for the holidays.
[01:12:15.588 --> 01:12:19.810]  Order a 100-bar case of our Pure Soap bars.
[01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.671]  Nothing like it in the country.
[01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:22.191]  It's $102.
[01:12:22.191 --> 01:12:29.635]  Go to your local marketplace and buy a package of your Ziploc bags, little plastic bags,
[01:12:30.626 --> 01:12:37.051]  And you have the most wonderful Christmas gift that money can buy.
[01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:45.437]  Put four, six, eight, or twelve in a little plastic bag, put a ribbon around it, and you've got yourself a great Christmas gift.
[01:12:45.437 --> 01:12:47.419]  Uh, it's the 15th today.
[01:12:47.419 --> 01:12:49.780]  We can barely make it to get it to you.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.861]  We'll rush it to you.
[01:12:50.861 --> 01:12:57.166]  All you gotta do is say, Alex Jones, and you become a priority account for shipping.
[01:12:57.166 --> 01:12:58.947]  We make pure soap.
[01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:05.366]  Folks that your grandmother and your great-grandmother used to use with no problem.
[01:13:05.366 --> 01:13:09.929]  But the UN says they're getting rid of family unit, so soon it'll be a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:09.929 --> 01:13:14.071]  I'll be like an old man saying, we once had parents and lived at home with them.
[01:13:14.992 --> 01:13:21.256]  Well, you know, if you'd like to go into junk science, if you'd like to get ripped off by Procter & Gamble and Lever and Colgate that have just raised their prices 25%
[01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:48.573]  And making the goods overseas, this is something which people don't know.
[01:13:48.573 --> 01:13:54.117]  They outsource the chemicals to get it cheaper and charge more in the States.
[01:13:54.117 --> 01:13:57.600]  And if you think the Chinese put toxins in there, just wait.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.542]  Oh, it's unbelievable what's going on in the chemical market.
[01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:02.904]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:14:02.904 --> 01:14:06.366]  The FDA says melamine's good for babies now.
[01:14:06.366 --> 01:14:09.349]  Doesn't matter if it kills them, they say it's good, Associated Press.
[01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:14.039]  Well, we... The government says mercury's good for us now, Marty.
[01:14:14.039 --> 01:14:15.240]  What's wrong with mercury?
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.062]  I know, but we're the world's best-kept secret.
[01:14:17.062 --> 01:14:19.283]  Nobody knows about it!
[01:14:19.283 --> 01:14:23.967]  And this is what's been really, really harmful, that people are getting ripped off.
[01:14:23.967 --> 01:14:31.674]  They're getting deteriorated clothing, burning and itching skin, a 25% expense on their grocery bill.
[01:14:31.674 --> 01:14:33.275]  All they've got to do is call me.
[01:14:33.275 --> 01:14:39.380]  We'll solve all their cleaning problems with bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:44.892]  We have it in bulk packages, which will save you thousands of dollars!
[01:14:44.892 --> 01:14:49.754]  Hard-earned dollars are saved by buying direct from our factory.
[01:14:49.754 --> 01:14:53.716]  And that's me and my son and my daughter and our whole family.
[01:14:53.716 --> 01:14:55.136]  We're not a corporation.
[01:14:55.136 --> 01:14:58.558]  We're a family partnership with one goal in mind.
[01:14:58.558 --> 01:15:06.421]  To sell the finest, highest quality, valued products direct to you from our factory to your home.
[01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:09.907]  With a guarantee that is unconditional.
[01:15:09.907 --> 01:15:15.688]  And it's still not too late to call and get it shipped out to your friends and family or yourself.
[01:15:15.688 --> 01:15:22.589]  The tote bag is a great sampler of the different products priced right at cost just for you to be able to try it out.
[01:15:22.589 --> 01:15:24.109]  Marty, give folks the toll free number.
[01:15:24.109 --> 01:15:26.309]  800, or we could say 1-800-340-7091.
[01:15:26.309 --> 01:15:26.369]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:15:36.055 --> 01:15:38.096]  Well, look us up on the web.
[01:15:38.096 --> 01:15:40.577]  5starsoap.com.
[01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:42.878]  5 the number or 5 the letter.
[01:15:42.878 --> 01:15:43.938]  5starsoap.com.
[01:15:43.938 --> 01:15:45.999]  Our whole story is there.
[01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:47.599]  Our data bulletins are there.
[01:15:47.599 --> 01:15:49.100]  Our photographs are there.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.901]  Our cost prices are there.
[01:15:50.901 --> 01:15:55.742]  You don't have to worry about a barcode to find out what it's going to cost you.
[01:15:55.742 --> 01:15:59.344]  You'll know what it costs you right now, direct to your door.
[01:15:59.344 --> 01:16:01.404]  We're happy to take care of you.
[01:16:01.404 --> 01:16:05.366]  And it's just one of the things that it's our career, our life.
[01:16:05.845 --> 01:16:13.328]  All right, well, Marty, let's fire the number out one more time, or 5starsoap.com.
[01:16:13.328 --> 01:16:16.850]  There's also banners on infowars.com and jonesreport.com.
[01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:20.531]  Just spell it out, or just use the number 5starsoap.com, or... 1-800-340-7091.
[01:16:20.531 --> 01:16:21.932]  Get a free catalog.
[01:16:27.202 --> 01:16:32.505]  Get our one-month supply to try it out, and you will be satisfied.
[01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.126]  Marty, absolutely.
[01:16:34.126 --> 01:16:35.607]  Give me a limerick, sir.
[01:16:35.607 --> 01:16:37.327]  Okay?
[01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:49.034]  There was a young man with a hernia who said to his doctor, Governor, when improving my middle, be sure you don't fiddle with matters that do not concern you.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.301]  Marty, you're something else.
[01:16:52.301 --> 01:16:53.922]  We'll talk to you again next year, buddy boy.
[01:16:53.922 --> 01:16:54.883]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:16:54.883 --> 01:16:56.285]  Talk to you in a year from now.
[01:16:56.285 --> 01:16:57.226]  I can't wait!
[01:16:57.226 --> 01:17:01.710]  Seems like yesterday you were doing the same joke about I'll talk to you next year, and here we are, Marty.
[01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:03.351]  Yes, it's been a long time.
[01:17:03.351 --> 01:17:04.152]  What a sweetheart.
[01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:04.893]  Take care, buddy.
[01:17:04.893 --> 01:17:05.994]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:17:05.994 --> 01:17:06.434]  You bet.
[01:17:06.434 --> 01:17:09.257]  You know, folks, when I joke around, it's not a joke.
[01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:18.751]  Remember a year and a half ago it was coming out that babies were dying by the thousands in China and hundreds were getting sick here, but our doctors know how to cover it up.
[01:17:18.751 --> 01:17:23.033]  Because if the government doesn't tell them it was melamine, then they don't report it.
[01:17:23.033 --> 01:17:27.734]  Just, oh, your 15-month-old's got kidney failure.
[01:17:27.734 --> 01:17:29.435]  We don't know why.
[01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:30.975]  Put him on dialysis.
[01:17:30.975 --> 01:17:34.297]  Keep drinking that store-bought formula.
[01:17:34.297 --> 01:17:35.417]  And then it came out that
[01:17:38.744 --> 01:17:39.665]  90 plus percent.
[01:17:39.665 --> 01:17:41.487]  In fact, that's the headline.
[01:17:41.487 --> 01:17:45.512]  90% of formula has melamine in it.
[01:17:45.512 --> 01:17:47.474]  Like, let me make sure on my memory on that.
[01:17:47.474 --> 01:17:50.478]  Google 90% of formula has melamine.
[01:17:50.478 --> 01:17:52.300]  I believe that's a Washington Post headline.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.004]  I know, there's another Washington Post headline. 50%
[01:17:58.385 --> 01:18:00.566]  of corn syrup products have high levels of mercury.
[01:18:00.566 --> 01:18:01.267]  They don't know why.
[01:18:01.267 --> 01:18:02.668]  It's not involved in manufacturing.
[01:18:02.668 --> 01:18:03.068]  I know why.
[01:18:03.068 --> 01:18:04.469]  It's added.
[01:18:04.469 --> 01:18:06.230]  They love you so much.
[01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:08.991]  And they're going to take good care of you and your family.
[01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:16.336]  But anyways, it came out that that was going on.
[01:18:16.336 --> 01:18:20.398]  And so the Food and Drug Administration just said, you know what?
[01:18:20.398 --> 01:18:25.201]  We're just going to say that melamine is now good for you.
[01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:28.671]  You can pull that up, you know.
[01:18:28.671 --> 01:18:31.612]  Melamine, not bad for children, may even be good.
[01:18:31.612 --> 01:18:33.632]  Here's a headline, 90% of U.S.
[01:18:33.632 --> 01:18:36.313]  infant formula may be contaminated with melamine.
[01:18:36.313 --> 01:18:38.854]  FDA abruptly declares chemicals safe for babies.
[01:18:38.854 --> 01:18:46.257]  Oh, and there's the Washington Post headline.
[01:18:46.257 --> 01:18:47.897]  And I'm the conspiracy theorist.
[01:18:47.897 --> 01:18:53.939]  I mean, how dumb do they think the public is to X out that GE ad?
[01:18:53.939 --> 01:18:55.820]  You gotta go over to the right-hand corner and it'll do it for you.
[01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:57.722]  Yeah, you see, you gotta close it.
[01:18:57.722 --> 01:18:58.303]  See up in the corner?
[01:18:58.303 --> 01:19:00.445]  That's how you close those full-page ads.
[01:19:00.445 --> 01:19:08.392]  It says, study finds high fructose corn syrup contains mercury.
[01:19:08.392 --> 01:19:13.377]  And it says, half of the 55 brand names, high levels of mercury.
[01:19:13.377 --> 01:19:16.740]  But hey, that's okay, because here's local news saying mercury's good for you.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.081]  Here it is.
[01:19:17.509 --> 01:19:23.951]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:19:23.951 --> 01:19:30.873]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:37.775]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:19:39.656 --> 01:19:43.959]  That's CBS News locally, but that was aired on every CBS channel in the country.
[01:19:43.959 --> 01:19:45.701]  They carry news packages.
[01:19:45.701 --> 01:19:47.002]  The video's already cut.
[01:19:47.002 --> 01:19:49.164]  It's satellited to them.
[01:19:49.164 --> 01:19:50.885]  Now it's interneted to them.
[01:19:50.885 --> 01:19:54.648]  And then the newsreader locally reads the script to give it a local view.
[01:19:54.648 --> 01:19:56.449]  So Mercury's good for you.
[01:19:56.449 --> 01:19:59.071]  And you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't believe it.
[01:19:59.071 --> 01:19:59.632]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:12.534 --> 01:20:12.614]  Sure.
[01:20:24.179 --> 01:20:24.980]  We're good to go!
[01:20:45.418 --> 01:20:48.699]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:48.699 --> 01:20:50.319]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:50.319 --> 01:20:51.699]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:14.327]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:20.713]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.713 --> 01:21:25.898]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:25.898 --> 01:21:35.887]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:36.007 --> 01:21:38.349]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.349 --> 01:21:39.930]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:42.392]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.392 --> 01:21:44.534]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.534 --> 01:21:49.678]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.678 --> 01:21:54.682]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:54.682 --> 01:21:58.785]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:00.802 --> 01:22:04.908]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[01:22:04.908 --> 01:22:09.174]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:10.756]  You get less for your money.
[01:22:10.756 --> 01:22:16.584]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[01:22:16.864 --> 01:22:17.124]  I think so.
[01:22:42.754 --> 01:22:43.114]  Thank you.
[01:23:00.996 --> 01:23:02.978]  Listen carefully to this message.
[01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:06.500]  If you're about to buy hardwood flooring, you're going to pay too much.

[01:23:52.013 --> 01:23:52.073]  1-800-580-5740.
[01:24:10.373 --> 01:24:20.339]  Okay, let's start going to phone calls as I build up towards a news blitz going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the next segment.
[01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:27.823]  Right now, let's go back to the calls and speak with Kevin in California.
[01:24:27.823 --> 01:24:28.623]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:24:28.623 --> 01:24:29.964]  Go ahead.
[01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:30.364]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:30.364 --> 01:24:31.605]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:31.605 --> 01:24:34.006]  I've been listening to you for about seven years.
[01:24:34.006 --> 01:24:36.128]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:24:36.128 --> 01:24:36.488]  Welcome.
[01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:37.912]  Thanks.
[01:24:37.912 --> 01:24:41.913]  I wanted to say thank you for the information that you've given us over the years.
[01:24:41.913 --> 01:24:48.535]  You woke me up about 9-11, around 2002-2003, many other issues.
[01:24:48.535 --> 01:24:49.756]  Thank you for that.
[01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:58.778]  A quick... Well, I was going to say, I wanted to comment on the fact, you know, people accuse you of being an agent, stuff like that, or whatever.
[01:24:58.778 --> 01:25:05.400]  Through all my research and trying to background check you, I've found no empirical evidence of you being an agent or
[01:25:06.135 --> 01:25:11.637]  Some bizarre connection to some nefarious group out there, so I haven't seen it.
[01:25:11.637 --> 01:25:14.698]  Yeah, but, well, there's also a lot of fake stuff people put up, too.
[01:25:14.698 --> 01:25:16.239]  You know, fake proof.
[01:25:16.239 --> 01:25:23.982]  But the issue is, or weird anecdotal stuff, the issue is, let's just say I'm bad.
[01:25:23.982 --> 01:25:24.382]  Okay?
[01:25:24.382 --> 01:25:25.742]  Let's just say I'm bad.
[01:25:25.742 --> 01:25:27.923]  Now, can we please fight the New World Order?
[01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:35.226]  Can we please fight for liberty and justice and freedom and smaller government instead of just obsessing over Alex Jones all day?
[01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:38.899]  Yeah, the ad hominems don't really help much.
[01:25:38.899 --> 01:25:43.142]  I mean, the proof is in the pudding, the proof is in the research.
[01:25:43.142 --> 01:25:46.604]  Why are we spending all our time researching Alex Jones?
[01:25:46.604 --> 01:25:53.229]  Why is that one of the biggest things on the internet, is literally spending all day on me, instead of fighting the globalists?
[01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:59.153]  And I'm telling you, most of it we've tracked back, when we've looked at it, to a government operation.
[01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.294]  They're actually countering us.
[01:26:01.294 --> 01:26:05.077]  And I should be glad that they're countering me this way, instead of just killing me.
[01:26:05.957 --> 01:26:12.101]  So I guess I want to say thank you to the globalists for not killing me and taking the non-violent route for now.
[01:26:12.101 --> 01:26:15.883]  But unfortunately for me, it's ineffective.
[01:26:15.883 --> 01:26:19.565]  So they may try some other things soon, but that's just the way it is.
[01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:26.589]  But go ahead sir, do you have any points or questions about the bigger wider universe and not the guy sitting in Austin, Texas?
[01:26:26.589 --> 01:26:27.569]  Sure, I'd be happy to.
[01:26:27.569 --> 01:26:30.731]  I have a question and a small request.
[01:26:30.731 --> 01:26:32.252]  My question is, I've been following
[01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:39.095]  Your coverage of Lord Monckton and Mike Rivero's coverage of it and this whole climate gate issue.
[01:26:39.095 --> 01:26:42.276]  I've like obsessed on it for like three weeks to a month now.
[01:26:42.276 --> 01:26:46.397]  That's good.
[01:26:46.397 --> 01:26:59.421]  I don't want to throw in a little, how would I say wrench in this works, or a straw man, but is Lord Monckton's connection to like say the Knights of Malta, is that any reason for concern?
[01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:06.232]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:06.232 --> 01:27:09.693]  Somebody sent me his Wikipedia page.
[01:27:09.693 --> 01:27:12.815]  I mean, that's a hospital group.
[01:27:12.815 --> 01:27:16.676]  The hospitalers set that up.
[01:27:16.676 --> 01:27:28.381]  And I just don't believe all the statements that people make about how if somebody's a member of the Order of the Knights of Malta that they're this all-powerful ruler.
[01:27:28.381 --> 01:27:31.002]  By the way, I have the Catholic Church in my stack today.
[01:27:31.954 --> 01:27:38.200]  Where the Pope is calling for global sustainability, and that means eugenics.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.503]  That means shutting people's resources off.
[01:27:41.503 --> 01:27:43.385]  It's horrible.
[01:27:43.385 --> 01:27:46.128]  So I was going to get to that and criticize that.
[01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:51.233]  I do not believe the Catholic Church is at the apex or at the tip-top of the pyramid.
[01:27:52.546 --> 01:27:54.187]  of the New World Order.
[01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:55.507]  In fact, that's a good question.
[01:27:55.507 --> 01:27:57.268]  That's an important thing to discuss.
[01:27:57.268 --> 01:28:00.028]  Maybe I should do a brief two or three minutes on that.
[01:28:00.028 --> 01:28:04.790]  What my research has shown is at the very top of the New World Order.
[01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:10.512]  But the Catholic Church is certainly right up there at the very top.
[01:28:10.512 --> 01:28:17.294]  It's groups at the top of each major organization that then actually create the very tip top of the pyramid.
[01:28:18.496 --> 01:28:19.737]  So it's kind of a catch-22.
[01:28:19.737 --> 01:28:30.385]  Yes, the Catholic Church is at the top of the pyramid, but no, it isn't at the top of the pyramid in total, because the globalists always want people to fight over one group.
[01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:37.071]  You know, it's Jews at the top of the pyramid, or it's Catholics at the top of the pyramid, or it's the Queen of England at the top of the pyramid.
[01:28:37.071 --> 01:28:45.457]  When it is all of those, the leaders of all the major groups, the Communist Chinese leaders, they go to the top of the pyramid meetings.
[01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:54.505]  You've got them all there together, waging war against humanity, working together behind the scenes.
[01:28:54.505 --> 01:29:04.673]  And the few rogue countries, some are good, some are bad, but the countries you hear about that are rogue, that are being attacked, those are the nations that aren't under their control.
[01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.715]  That doesn't mean they're good either.
[01:29:06.715 --> 01:29:08.976]  But they're not the big global power.
[01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:13.620]  They're not the real threat to you and I. Like Iran.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:14.621]  Or Sudan.
[01:29:17.492 --> 01:29:20.834]  Or countries like that.
[01:29:20.834 --> 01:29:26.177]  There's only a handful of countries the New World Order doesn't control.
[01:29:26.177 --> 01:29:31.301]  And you see the New World Order waging war against those countries to bring them down.
[01:29:31.301 --> 01:29:32.922]  Somalia.
[01:29:32.922 --> 01:29:34.843]  I mean, they've pretty much mopped up everything.
[01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:44.095]  But that doesn't matter on the whole Lord Monckton question, because the issue is Copenhagen defeating it.
[01:29:44.095 --> 01:29:51.482]  But we can't defeat Copenhagen because we've got a ninny over the fact that he's a British Lord.
[01:29:51.482 --> 01:29:55.407]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.407 --> 01:29:58.090]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.626 --> 01:30:04.727]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:30:04.727 --> 01:30:07.608]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:07.608 --> 01:30:09.689]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:30:09.689 --> 01:30:11.929]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:11.929 --> 01:30:13.590]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:17.911]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:30:48.429 --> 01:30:50.352]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:31:00.347 --> 01:31:04.888]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.888 --> 01:31:05.808]  Number one.
[01:31:05.808 --> 01:31:09.229]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:10.089]  Number two.
[01:31:10.089 --> 01:31:14.971]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.971 --> 01:31:15.711]  It's true.
[01:31:15.711 --> 01:31:20.592]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.592 --> 01:31:21.412]  Number three.
[01:31:21.412 --> 01:31:24.993]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.993 --> 01:31:28.714]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.914 --> 01:31:29.715]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.715 --> 01:31:32.477]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.477 --> 01:31:36.140]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:36.941]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.941 --> 01:31:41.085]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.085 --> 01:31:45.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:50.312]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.312 --> 01:31:52.094]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.094 --> 01:31:54.336]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.336 --> 01:31:56.697]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.957 --> 01:32:05.918]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.918 --> 01:32:14.779]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:19.400]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:30.222]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.862 --> 01:32:40.365]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.365 --> 01:32:45.807]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.807 --> 01:32:53.290]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.031]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:00.299 --> 01:33:12.384]  Z. There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[01:33:12.384 --> 01:33:15.905]  Use it only in emergency.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:30.404]  We're good to go.
[01:33:54.696 --> 01:33:56.496]  I'm belling it up to the bar here.
[01:33:56.496 --> 01:34:13.201]  I'm trying to get focused and trying to cover all this incredible news that is just so amazing.
[01:34:13.201 --> 01:34:17.342]  What I'm going to do now, because I got a little bit behind today like I always do, is I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:25.393]  I'm going to try to take a lot of them and the questions are always incredibly important so that I tend to never get to your calls.
[01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:34.316]  We are simulcasting this radio show right now at PrisonPlanet.TV for PrisonPlanet.TV members.

[01:34:54.675 --> 01:34:55.756]  It comes out to like $3.
[01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:57.716]  $3.25, I think, when you get the year discount per month.
[01:35:03.722 --> 01:35:12.845]  And you get the live TV show slash radio show, you get better archives of the radio, better archives of the TV, all my films in super high quality, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:35:12.845 --> 01:35:15.426]  By the way, my book is just now going out of print.
[01:35:15.426 --> 01:35:18.087]  Watson's is already out of print.
[01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:20.428]  Never to be back in print.
[01:35:20.428 --> 01:35:21.468]  At least we don't intend to.
[01:35:21.468 --> 01:35:27.530]  Because my office used to be so messy, I don't have the original
[01:35:28.837 --> 01:35:32.220]  Original computer files, they're somewhere around here to reprint them.
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:34.802]  Plus, I don't have the money to reprint a book.
[01:35:34.802 --> 01:35:37.784]  Because after a book's been out a while, it really doesn't sell very good anymore.
[01:35:37.784 --> 01:35:42.828]  The point is, is that there's a lot of stuff at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:42.828 --> 01:35:48.112]  And when you get a 15-cent-a-day membership, it's even less when you sign up during Christmas.
[01:35:48.112 --> 01:35:53.456]  And six computers can simultaneously log on with the same username and passcode.
[01:35:54.176 --> 01:36:04.020]  So you can give yourself a gift of PrisonPlanet.tv and then create a username and passcode and give it to your friends, your family, couple of your neighbors.
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:06.921]  The chances that six of them will log on simultaneously is...
[01:36:09.295 --> 01:36:10.836]  We just want it to be used.
[01:36:10.836 --> 01:36:12.236]  We want people to be educated.
[01:36:12.236 --> 01:36:14.297]  It's an armory of resistance.
[01:36:14.297 --> 01:36:16.677]  You can download the films, burn them to disk.
[01:36:16.677 --> 01:36:27.501]  The last four or five films we have in DivX version, really good quality, that you can burn to regular CDs that play on all the new DVD players and most of the old ones, and on computers.
[01:36:29.557 --> 01:36:42.486]  And you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and just start burning Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising, The Obama Deception to disc and giving it to people.
[01:36:42.486 --> 01:36:47.810]  We've also got specials running through Christmas of where you get Fall of the Republic or The Obama Deception.
[01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:53.454]  You can get a free Endgame or a free Obama Joker t-shirt.
[01:36:53.454 --> 01:36:58.198]  Those deals only last as long as the supplies last and we are running out of the Joker t-shirts.
[01:36:59.287 --> 01:37:04.290]  And so as we run out of different versions of the Joker t-shirt, we've added some other t-shirts up there.
[01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:12.996]  So no matter what your size is, you can get the free t-shirts at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:12.996 --> 01:37:18.199]  Okay.
[01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:22.382]  Coming up after calls, again I'm gonna get to these video clips of UN censorship.
[01:37:23.831 --> 01:37:27.792]  I'm going to get to the latest on ClimateGate and the global government establishment.
[01:37:27.792 --> 01:37:31.453]  The good news is Copenhagen is in deep trouble.
[01:37:31.453 --> 01:37:35.554]  It's falling apart even better than I thought it would.
[01:37:35.554 --> 01:37:39.935]  The Death Star's explosion is a little bit prettier from a distance than I even thought it would be.
[01:37:39.935 --> 01:37:46.657]  Seeing the real thing is just... It's like seeing a beautiful woman on television.
[01:37:46.657 --> 01:37:48.818]  It's not like seeing one in person where you can smell them.
[01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:52.211]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:52.211 --> 01:37:58.194]  Watching the New World Order blow a gasket and... They're down, but they're not out.
[01:37:58.194 --> 01:38:06.018]  But let me tell you, watching them bleed in the ditch is certainly quite a feast for the eyes.
[01:38:06.018 --> 01:38:08.459]  Craig Sadler's just having a field day laughing in there.
[01:38:08.459 --> 01:38:09.339]  That's good.
[01:38:09.339 --> 01:38:11.381]  What's so funny?
[01:38:11.381 --> 01:38:17.484]  Oh, you just... Well, you know it.
[01:38:17.484 --> 01:38:19.865]  You know women are God's gift to the planet.
[01:38:20.811 --> 01:38:22.512]  I mean, why not just admit we like women?
[01:38:22.512 --> 01:38:46.072]  Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[01:38:47.267 --> 01:38:52.634]  Do tend to get a little, well I'm having endorphins flow right now, just like your Super Bowl team wins.
[01:38:52.634 --> 01:38:53.375]  You've been a fan of...
[01:38:55.754 --> 01:38:59.357]  Say the Patriots for a decade and they won the Super Bowl, you get all excited?
[01:38:59.357 --> 01:39:02.519]  That's your primitive synapsis firing.
[01:39:02.519 --> 01:39:10.945]  It's fooled your body to believe your tribe has just had some victory over an enemy army that was going to kill you and drag your women and children off.
[01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:17.209]  And so, you just won the battle, you're feeling good, but it's not real.
[01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:18.730]  It's over something that doesn't matter.
[01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:21.852]  But I start having victory chills.
[01:39:21.852 --> 01:39:23.894]  I'm having them right now.
[01:39:23.894 --> 01:39:25.035]  My hair is even standing out.
[01:39:25.987 --> 01:39:31.970]  My French Bulldog, when it gets excited, the rough sticks out.
[01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:37.013]  My hair is actually standing up on end with excitement.
[01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:40.255]  Because I can taste victory.
[01:39:40.255 --> 01:39:44.737]  I can just feel the New World Order having its power sapped and drained.
[01:39:44.737 --> 01:39:46.958]  Oh, it's still powerful, but I liken it to 2001 space.
[01:39:49.306 --> 01:39:58.853]  Odyssey, when the commander's gotten into the crawlspace and he's turning the HAL 9000 off, and it's going, I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:39:58.853 --> 01:39:59.614]  I'm afraid.
[01:39:59.614 --> 01:40:02.416]  And he's just focused, just turning it off.
[01:40:02.416 --> 01:40:05.958]  It takes a long time to defeat the New World Order.
[01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:09.821]  Just like it took them a long time to get their system going.
[01:40:09.821 --> 01:40:12.063]  But it's like a big sandcastle they've built.
[01:40:12.063 --> 01:40:14.905]  They spent weeks building it, but now a high tide's coming in.
[01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:21.133]  And washing it out, they're like piling sand up as fast as they can, and it doesn't matter!
[01:40:21.133 --> 01:40:26.676]  The tide's coming in on them!
[01:40:26.676 --> 01:40:27.737]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:40:27.737 --> 01:40:28.337]  Sorry.
[01:40:28.337 --> 01:40:30.598]  Sorry.
[01:40:30.598 --> 01:40:40.904]  There's a lot of bad stuff happening too, but man, when we start having big victories, I'm gonna break down the big victory, but um... Alright, Annie, Hartwell, Lynn, Brandon, Curtis, I'm out of control.
[01:40:40.904 --> 01:40:41.785]  I'm going to you in a moment.
[01:40:43.104 --> 01:40:55.030]  The last caller called in, and with hushed reverence, he said, Alex, do you mind if I speak to you about Knights of Malta?
[01:40:55.030 --> 01:41:03.995]  And it's almost like the Monty Python when they jump out and they go, the Spanish Inquisition!
[01:41:03.995 --> 01:41:06.476]  In fact, can you pull that up on YouTube?
[01:41:06.476 --> 01:41:08.437]  Monty Python, the Spanish Inquisition.
[01:41:09.716 --> 01:41:16.739]  It's not like it's the dun-dun-dun Spanish Inquisition!
[01:41:16.739 --> 01:41:36.409]  But, yes, I know Lord Monckton's a lord, and he's a member of a whole bunch of fraternal organizations, and he is a hereditary peer, he's Scottish, and he's always had an anti-socialism, anti-New World Order, anti-global government bent, he's anti-European Union,
[01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:42.053]  Yes, he is a Catholic, but there's different branches of the Catholics.
[01:41:42.053 --> 01:41:47.957]  The Catholic Church is involved, Rome is, big time with pushing the European Union.
[01:41:47.957 --> 01:41:50.239]  That is true.
[01:41:50.239 --> 01:42:03.448]  And the Dutch Prince Bernhard and Joseph Redinger and others were involved with the Jesuits and are involved trying to set up that empire.
[01:42:03.448 --> 01:42:06.330]  And the Catholic Church is right up there, part of the pyramid.
[01:42:07.691 --> 01:42:08.411]  There.
[01:42:08.411 --> 01:42:09.851]  I've talked about it forever.
[01:42:09.851 --> 01:42:12.492]  They say he will never discuss it, he will never talk about it.
[01:42:12.492 --> 01:42:13.292]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:13.292 --> 01:42:15.393]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:42:15.393 --> 01:42:16.433]  It's like Glenn Beck.
[01:42:16.433 --> 01:42:23.694]  I would love to support Glenn Beck, but the guy says we need to have value-added taxes and there are no FEMA camps and Ron Paul's bad.
[01:42:23.694 --> 01:42:26.075]  And then his supporters call me and go, I never heard him say that.
[01:42:26.075 --> 01:42:29.235]  Well, you must not be paying attention then.
[01:42:29.235 --> 01:42:31.716]  All I hear is good stuff out of Lord Monckton's mouth.
[01:42:31.716 --> 01:42:35.397]  And he's there covering it, and we get him on and talk about it.
[01:42:35.397 --> 01:42:37.437]  And he writes devastatingly accurate,
[01:42:38.803 --> 01:42:41.404]  Here it is over here.
[01:42:41.404 --> 01:42:44.305]  Detailed reports about what's happening.
[01:42:44.305 --> 01:42:46.827]  The fruit off this tree is good.
[01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:50.248]  If Lord Monckton was an apple tree, it's like a honeycrisp.
[01:42:50.248 --> 01:42:51.569]  You know those big juicy apples?
[01:42:51.569 --> 01:42:56.531]  I mean, Lord Monckton is like, oh man, this is really good!
[01:42:56.531 --> 01:43:00.233]  This guy has done a lot of good work in his life fighting tyranny.
[01:43:00.233 --> 01:43:02.534]  And so you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:43:02.534 --> 01:43:02.954]  I mean, look.
[01:43:04.642 --> 01:43:08.845]  The biggest thing is people think that everyone in every system is evil.
[01:43:08.845 --> 01:43:13.528]  And I've always talked about compartmentalization.
[01:43:13.528 --> 01:43:26.458]  Saul of Tarsus was a Sanhedrin enforcer for the Jewish religious hardcore Sadducees and Pharisees.
[01:43:26.458 --> 01:43:33.163]  And he would go around killing people all over Greece and all over Turkey and all over
[01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:38.185]  Rome and all over Italy and all over Judea.
[01:43:38.185 --> 01:43:42.808]  I mean, he was like Darth Vader, folks, hunting people down and killing them.
[01:43:42.808 --> 01:43:46.090]  But then he woke up and had a revelation.
[01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:52.675]  And you're going to see that powerful people from inside the structure are who we want to stand up.
[01:43:52.675 --> 01:43:53.275]  What is...
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.842]  G. Edward Griffin talk about all the time.
[01:43:56.842 --> 01:44:05.092]  We have to sell our idea of liberty and freedom and a lot of these people in the system aren't active or they don't understand the big picture.
[01:44:05.092 --> 01:44:08.937]  And as they wake up and get educated, we're going to wake them up.
[01:44:08.937 --> 01:44:12.781]  Instead, everybody, like half the people out there, obsess over
[01:44:13.968 --> 01:44:16.250]  Is the planet really run by aliens?
[01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:17.851]  Is it really run by Jews?
[01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.852]  Is it really run by Catholics?
[01:44:19.852 --> 01:44:22.394]  Is it really run by the Illuminati?
[01:44:22.394 --> 01:44:31.220]  Is it really run by... And if I could say anything to you, I only go off what I can prove.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:35.383]  And the Protestant leadership, the Catholic leadership, the Jewish leadership,
[01:44:36.451 --> 01:44:41.775]  The Turkish leadership, the German leadership, the Japanese leadership, they all think the same.
[01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.316]  We're the elites over our group.
[01:44:44.316 --> 01:44:48.339]  We keep our groups in fear of the outside to give us power.
[01:44:48.339 --> 01:44:50.461]  We feed off our groups.
[01:44:50.461 --> 01:44:55.404]  We always give them an outside threat so they let us abuse them.
[01:44:55.404 --> 01:44:59.547]  And we're social engineers who believe that we have a right to rule people.
[01:45:02.797 --> 01:45:04.618]  And that's who the globalists are.
[01:45:04.618 --> 01:45:11.443]  They use scientific systems of control to dominate populations.
[01:45:11.443 --> 01:45:18.407]  And so you have a bunch of different pyramids coming up together at that tip top.
[01:45:18.407 --> 01:45:20.169]  And so it isn't a Jewish conspiracy.
[01:45:20.169 --> 01:45:22.170]  It isn't a Catholic conspiracy.
[01:45:22.170 --> 01:45:23.791]  It isn't a Protestant conspiracy.
[01:45:23.791 --> 01:45:25.832]  It isn't a Muslim conspiracy.
[01:45:25.832 --> 01:45:28.594]  It isn't an atheist conspiracy.
[01:45:28.594 --> 01:45:29.035]  It is a
[01:45:31.192 --> 01:45:34.395]  Power group conspiracy.
[01:45:34.395 --> 01:45:46.344]  It is a scientific dictatorship of people that know how humans operate and who have set up scientific systems of control.
[01:45:46.344 --> 01:45:49.867]  That's the bottom line.
[01:45:49.867 --> 01:45:58.974]  And so, you must oppose their systems, their global taxes, their global regulations, their federalization of your local police.
[01:46:00.148 --> 01:46:12.420]  But if you go to a city council meeting and start talking about Jews, or start talking about Catholics, or start talking about Muslims, everybody has been trained that that's divide and conquer.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.422]  They're not going to listen to what you say.
[01:46:14.422 --> 01:46:22.089]  That's why the feds infiltrate groups and try to get them to be singular issue.
[01:46:23.849 --> 01:46:25.590]  So you can be divided.
[01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:27.330]  This is their ballgame.
[01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:38.194]  And then once you're divided, they can threaten other groups with you and actually build up their power over here, and then no one's ever covering the big picture.
[01:46:38.194 --> 01:46:43.216]  I mean, supernatural powers are attributed to the
[01:46:44.622 --> 01:46:45.382]  Catholics.
[01:46:45.382 --> 01:46:56.246]  They're just all secret agents of the Vatican, running around in black robes at night, and people superimpose my head on Catholic priest robes and say I'm this top assassin.
[01:46:56.246 --> 01:46:58.907]  I mean, it's just completely made up, folks.
[01:46:58.907 --> 01:46:59.947]  I'm not Catholic.
[01:46:59.947 --> 01:47:01.628]  I'm nothing against Catholics.
[01:47:01.628 --> 01:47:04.029]  My family are famous Protestants.
[01:47:04.029 --> 01:47:06.870]  Captain Jones of the Mayflower, on my dad's side.
[01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:11.171]  On my mother's side, two of the people on the Mayflower, direct descendants.
[01:47:11.171 --> 01:47:13.252]  My family involved in founding Texas.
[01:47:15.342 --> 01:47:25.647]  William Ayers came in with a shipload of Bibles, sold everything he owned in New York because the Catholics were making people pledge to be Catholics to get land grants in Texas, and the Protestants were upset.
[01:47:25.647 --> 01:47:32.690]  I mean, I come from famous Protestants, folks, as pure a pedigree as it gets.
[01:47:32.690 --> 01:47:38.512]  And then some Israeli operative group that wants to get patriots fighting with each other says, I work for the Vatican.
[01:47:38.512 --> 01:47:41.634]  And then other weak-minded people just say it to sell books and stuff.
[01:47:42.942 --> 01:47:44.622]  And I don't care about being attacked.
[01:47:44.622 --> 01:47:46.483]  It only makes me bigger.
[01:47:46.483 --> 01:47:50.904]  And people actually come check me out and find out who I really am.
[01:47:50.904 --> 01:47:58.586]  So in the bigger plan, God's plan, people attacking me actually only helps us.
[01:47:58.586 --> 01:48:11.729]  But in the globalist plan, it's meant to get all of you in fighting so that you never activate as a leader and go out and warn people and take action on real issues.
[01:48:11.729 --> 01:48:12.209]  It's meant
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:35.670]  To keep you chasing your tail, so that you don't go, this is about me, Tom Jones, or Bill Smith, or Zach Johnson, or whatever your name is, standing up as John Doe or Susie Q, and going out and picking an issue and taking action.
[01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:41.393]  It is the conspiracy theory baloney.
[01:48:41.393 --> 01:48:44.774]  I don't cover conspiracy theories here, folks.
[01:48:44.774 --> 01:48:47.054]  I cover the real information.
[01:48:47.054 --> 01:48:48.074]  Day in, day out.
[01:48:48.074 --> 01:48:48.775]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:48:48.775 --> 01:48:49.335]  I'm done.
[01:48:49.335 --> 01:48:54.316]  Now, see, no matter how good the calls are and how important the questions are, I just can't do calls like that.
[01:48:54.316 --> 01:48:57.797]  Let's see if we can... We've never succeeded in taking call after call.
[01:48:57.797 --> 01:48:59.337]  But let's see if we can succeed.
[01:48:59.337 --> 01:49:02.498]  Annie in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:49:02.498 --> 01:49:03.118]  Hi, yes.
[01:49:03.118 --> 01:49:06.299]  I was just wondering about the census that's coming up next year.
[01:49:06.889 --> 01:49:09.210]  Is it something that we should do?
[01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:10.211]  Or advise people to do?
[01:49:10.211 --> 01:49:20.175]  Well, ma'am, that's your option if you want to do it, but it's a violation of the Fifth Amendment to make you incriminate yourself, to answer dozens and dozens and dozens of questions, depending on which form you get.
[01:49:20.175 --> 01:49:22.236]  They randomly send out longer forms.
[01:49:22.236 --> 01:49:28.099]  It's not their business if you own guns or what your stocks and bonds are or how big a flush toilet your toilet is.
[01:49:28.099 --> 01:49:34.342]  I don't fill the census out, and when the young punk bangs on my door and threatens me, I tell him, get off my property, they're trespassing.
[01:49:35.967 --> 01:49:38.127]  I don't open the door for census takers.
[01:49:38.127 --> 01:49:44.029]  They're banker, slave, grocers, there to see what their slave's doing.
[01:49:44.029 --> 01:49:49.410]  And they're training you to answer questions you don't have to answer.
[01:49:49.410 --> 01:49:55.771]  But is it not held secret for 72 years?
[01:49:55.771 --> 01:50:03.813]  No, I'm just laughing because, no ma'am, the federal government admits they share all the census data with whoever they want.
[01:50:06.684 --> 01:50:07.784]  Perfect, thank you.
[01:50:07.784 --> 01:50:08.345]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:50:08.345 --> 01:50:10.025]  And then the people that come to your door will just lie.
[01:50:10.025 --> 01:50:13.667]  I mean, most of them don't even know what planet they're on or how many continents there are.
[01:50:13.667 --> 01:50:15.227]  They think polar bears can't swim.
[01:50:15.227 --> 01:50:21.410]  I mean, that's how dumb the public is, is Al Gorkin telling them polar bears can't swim and the sun has nothing to do with heating the planet.
[01:50:22.981 --> 01:50:27.985]  I mean, and people are probably tuning in right now going, well yeah, the news says it doesn't.
[01:50:27.985 --> 01:50:33.910]  Mercury's good for you, melamine's good for children, and the sun doesn't heat the earth, and penguins and polar bears can't swim.
[01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:38.554]  I mean, why is it hard to figure this out?
[01:50:38.554 --> 01:50:39.735]  Why?
[01:50:39.735 --> 01:50:42.738]  I mean, I'm here saying, don't drink mercury.
[01:50:44.431 --> 01:50:47.197]  But is it true you're a Vatican assassin?
[01:50:47.197 --> 01:50:49.922]  Did you guys ever find the clip of the Spanish Inquisition?
[01:50:49.922 --> 01:50:50.964]  We'll come back with that.
[01:50:50.964 --> 01:50:53.489]  The Spanish Inquisition!

[01:53:04.426 --> 01:53:06.726]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?

[01:53:07.586 --> 01:53:11.027]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:53:48.633 --> 01:53:54.995]  I don't know, Mr. Wentworth just told me to come in here and say that there was trouble at the mill, that's all!
[01:53:54.995 --> 01:53:57.096]  I didn't expect the kind of Spanish Inquisition!
[01:54:13.779 --> 01:54:17.121]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
[01:54:17.121 --> 01:54:18.761]  Our chief weapon is surprise.
[01:54:18.761 --> 01:54:19.822]  Surprise and fear.
[01:54:19.822 --> 01:54:20.362]  Fear and surprise.
[01:54:20.362 --> 01:54:23.824]  Our two weapons are fear and surprise and ruthless efficiency.
[01:54:23.824 --> 01:54:29.826]  Our three weapons are fear and surprise and ruthless efficiency and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope.
[01:54:29.826 --> 01:54:32.087]  Our four... no.
[01:54:32.087 --> 01:54:39.731]  Amongst our weapons... Amongst our weaponry are such elements as fear... I'll come in again.
[01:54:45.854 --> 01:54:51.737]  I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition.
[01:54:51.737 --> 01:54:54.658]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
[01:54:54.658 --> 01:55:03.082]  Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as fear, surprise, ruthlessness, vigilance, and almost fanatical devotion to the Pope and a nice red uniform.
[01:55:03.082 --> 01:55:05.524]  Oh, damn it!
[01:55:05.524 --> 01:55:06.884]  I can't say it to her, if you say it.
[01:55:06.884 --> 01:55:07.024]  What?
[01:55:07.024 --> 01:55:09.866]  You have to say the bit about our chief weaponist.
[01:55:09.866 --> 01:55:10.986]  I couldn't do that.
[01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:18.302]  That was funny.
[01:55:18.302 --> 01:55:23.403]  Okay, uh, Hartwell in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:55:23.403 --> 01:55:25.003]  Welcome.
[01:55:25.003 --> 01:55:32.144]  Alex, it's been over two years since I've talked with you and I'm calling you today to thank you for letting me make copies of your videos.
[01:55:32.144 --> 01:55:35.885]  I have a DVD burner that burned four at one time.
[01:55:35.885 --> 01:55:40.966]  I made many copies of all of your videos that I have and I have all of them and
[01:55:41.576 --> 01:55:45.799]  I want you to know that I give them away, I never accept a donation.
[01:55:45.799 --> 01:55:49.502]  So once again, thank you, and may God protect you.
[01:55:49.502 --> 01:55:53.264]  Well, thank you, and let me just say, I want to thank you for making copies of the film.
[01:55:53.264 --> 01:55:55.966]  That's why we make them available.
[01:55:55.966 --> 01:56:00.389]  And we want people to also certainly support themselves in what they're doing.
[01:56:00.389 --> 01:56:03.171]  In the past, I even told people to take donations.
[01:56:03.171 --> 01:56:07.814]  The problem is, they then start selling them, and then telling me I can't even sell my own films.
[01:56:07.814 --> 01:56:09.756]  I never expected what some people would do, but
[01:56:10.336 --> 01:56:13.920]  I just want you to know that I can't do what you're doing, but I'll do whatever I can.
[01:56:31.934 --> 01:56:34.055]  Okay, let's talk to Len in Oklahoma.
[01:56:34.055 --> 01:56:35.275]  Len, go ahead.
[01:56:35.275 --> 01:56:35.956]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:56:35.956 --> 01:56:45.540]  I just wondered, did you happen to catch the speech that Dana Rohrabacher gave last week on the floor of the House of Representatives, where he called out the globalists and talked about global government?
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.401]  I actually sat and watched the whole thing last week.
[01:56:49.955 --> 01:56:51.555]  How long was it?
[01:56:51.555 --> 01:56:52.856]  How long was it?
[01:56:52.856 --> 01:56:54.416]  How long was it?
[01:56:54.416 --> 01:56:56.176]  30, maybe 45 minutes.
[01:56:56.176 --> 01:56:56.997]  I watched it.
[01:56:56.997 --> 01:56:57.997]  Yes, I did.
[01:56:57.997 --> 01:56:59.517]  I did see a short clip of it.
[01:56:59.517 --> 01:57:03.538]  You know, used to that would have been, wow, somebody's admitting world government.
[01:57:03.538 --> 01:57:15.500]  Now everybody's admitting it, even the guy that Chuck Norris likes, the former governor, is coming out and talking about it.
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:17.161]  And yes, I did see a short clip of it.
[01:57:17.161 --> 01:57:17.721]  Tell us about it.
[01:57:18.422 --> 01:57:32.830]  Well it was interesting because during the course of the speech he laid out this whole global warming fraud and he talked about the global cooling of the 1970s and how the alarm bells were being rung at that time.
[01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:40.375]  He talked about his family and two or three different times he flat out said, Americans wake up!
[01:57:40.945 --> 01:57:45.310]  And he did this on the floor of the House of Representatives, right on C-SPAN, and I fell out of my chair.
[01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:46.971]  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
[01:57:46.971 --> 01:57:50.415]  Guys, go to YouTube and type in, Dana Rohrabacher talks about New World Order.
[01:57:50.415 --> 01:57:51.416]  I need that anyways.
[01:57:51.416 --> 01:57:52.277]  I need Aaron to get that.
[01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:58.213]  It's about a 30, maybe a 45 minute speech, and I believe... No, no, I actually saw a clip a few days ago.
[01:57:58.213 --> 01:58:07.979]  That's the problem, is I spend all these hours researching, and then I get up here on air, and it's like piles every day, and I'm like, how do I even start?
[01:58:07.979 --> 01:58:09.320]  But see, that's why I love taking calls.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:10.961]  You brought it up.
[01:58:10.961 --> 01:58:17.885]  I didn't have time to watch the whole speech, but yeah, that's the good news, is we can now actually have real discussions about what's really happening.
[01:58:17.885 --> 01:58:18.865]  Very exciting.
[01:58:18.865 --> 01:58:19.566]  Thank you, Len.
[01:58:21.072 --> 01:58:26.536]  Brandon, Curtis, Francis, Josh, and others.
[01:58:26.536 --> 01:58:33.341]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the start of the third and fourth hours.
[01:58:33.341 --> 01:58:42.688]  And coming up, I'm going to get into UN censorship in Copenhagen and a lot more.
[01:58:42.688 --> 01:58:46.370]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.205 --> 01:58:56.228]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.228 --> 01:58:59.451]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.451 --> 01:59:04.255]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.255 --> 01:59:10.660]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.902]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.402 --> 01:59:13.722]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.722 --> 01:59:14.243]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.243 --> 01:59:14.844]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.844 --> 01:59:15.585]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.585 --> 01:59:17.707]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.324 --> 01:59:34.466]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.466 --> 01:59:39.610]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:00:10.477 --> 02:00:12.038]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.618]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.618 --> 02:00:17.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:20.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.441 --> 02:00:30.005]  When the sun doesn't contribute to climate change, the sunspots cycle.
[02:00:30.005 --> 02:00:32.706]  When the sunspots go down, that's the big
[02:00:34.071 --> 02:00:43.117]  Storms ejecting fireballs thousands of times the size of the Earth can fit over a million planet Earths inside the Sun.
[02:00:43.117 --> 02:00:52.043]  And the United Nations is in the news today saying, no, the Sun has nothing to do with our climate.
[02:00:52.043 --> 02:00:53.905]  And polar bears can't swim, too.
[02:00:53.905 --> 02:00:57.787]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, these people think you're idiots.
[02:00:57.787 --> 02:00:59.729]  They think you are morons.
[02:01:01.636 --> 02:01:06.917]  They think you are the biggest fools ever to walk the green earth.
[02:01:06.917 --> 02:01:10.778]  Alright, I'm going to continue with phone calls in a little bit of the next segment.
[02:01:10.778 --> 02:01:24.121]  I'm going to get into UN goons, silenced journalist who questions Gore on ClimateGate, carbon billionaire refuses to correct the record on statements regarding CRU emails.
[02:01:24.121 --> 02:01:27.942]  That's the latest PrisonPlanet.com article by Steve Watson and Paul Watson.
[02:01:27.942 --> 02:01:28.922]  Can you guys print that for me?
[02:01:28.922 --> 02:01:29.182]  Thank you.
[02:01:30.674 --> 02:01:37.780]  Then I'll run through the latest on Climategate and a bunch of other news here that we haven't even gotten to yet on the war front, the economy front.
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:42.083]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[02:01:42.083 --> 02:01:47.287]  Let's talk to Brandon in Utah.
[02:01:47.287 --> 02:01:49.289]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[02:01:49.289 --> 02:01:50.790]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:51.670]  Hey, buddy.
[02:01:51.670 --> 02:01:59.737]  I was just wondering if you have reported on British Court issues arrest warrant for Zipney Livney, Israeli Foreign Minister for war crimes.
[02:02:00.809 --> 02:02:02.510]  Uh, if that's news to you or not.
[02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:03.510]  No, it is news.
[02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:05.731]  In fact, say the headline again.
[02:02:05.731 --> 02:02:14.035]  British Court Issues Arrest Warrant for Zippy Livni, Israeli Foreign Minister for War Crimes.
[02:02:14.035 --> 02:02:19.578]  And, uh, yeah, I just watched a little video from, I think it was from BBC.
[02:02:19.578 --> 02:02:21.458]  Somebody on MySpace sent it to me.
[02:02:21.458 --> 02:02:29.422]  So just thought maybe you might want to react to that if it's actually going to go through because I think that, um, uh,
[02:02:29.861 --> 02:02:37.244]  Bush and Cheney have also been issued warrants as well, but whatever.
[02:02:37.244 --> 02:02:40.305]  I don't think anything's going to come up about that.
[02:02:40.305 --> 02:02:41.146]  Well, we'll look it up.
[02:02:41.146 --> 02:02:43.427]  British court issues arrest warrant.
[02:02:43.427 --> 02:02:45.007]  What was the rest of the headline?
[02:02:45.007 --> 02:02:47.008]  For war crimes.
[02:02:47.008 --> 02:02:50.289]  Israeli foreign minister for war crimes.
[02:02:50.289 --> 02:02:51.770]  Alright, we'll pull that up.
[02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:53.771]  No, no, I was not aware of that.
[02:02:53.771 --> 02:02:58.673]  Definitely lying about WMDs going into Iraq.
[02:02:59.844 --> 02:03:07.848]  Killing over a million people conservatively, according to the British Lancet Journal, which is non-partisan.
[02:03:07.848 --> 02:03:13.170]  Even the neocons admit that war crimes have been committed.
[02:03:13.170 --> 02:03:18.473]  And when predator drones blow up apartment buildings,
[02:03:19.636 --> 02:03:21.757]  Whether it be the Israeli forces or the U.S.
[02:03:21.757 --> 02:03:27.420]  forces doing it, and kill, in some cases, hundreds of innocent people.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:31.622]  That is terrorism, just like if the Muslims do it, it's terrorism.
[02:03:31.622 --> 02:03:34.163]  And I'm just tired of unequal justice.
[02:03:34.163 --> 02:03:46.989]  In fact, you're right, sir, there's the Times of London, Israeli fury over British war crimes warrant for Tsepi Levini, I hope I'm pronouncing that right,
[02:03:48.444 --> 02:03:49.505]  In fact, here's the article.
[02:03:49.505 --> 02:03:51.687]  Guys, how would I pronounce that?
[02:03:51.687 --> 02:03:53.808]  Tazippy?
[02:03:53.808 --> 02:03:54.289]  Lavinny?
[02:03:54.289 --> 02:03:56.510]  Is that right?
[02:03:56.510 --> 02:04:00.273]  Sounds good.
[02:04:00.273 --> 02:04:07.279]  So, there have been these British warrants issued before by mid-level and low-level courts, and they've always been squashed.
[02:04:07.279 --> 02:04:09.541]  So, we'll see what happens with that.
[02:04:11.055 --> 02:04:14.377]  I've always told people this is going to turn into a sideshow.
[02:04:14.377 --> 02:04:18.219]  Israel is being built up as the boogeyman.
[02:04:18.219 --> 02:04:20.700]  It's very popular to do it.
[02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:27.723]  President Carter does it, and Israel certainly engages in its share of bad behavior and crimes.
[02:04:27.723 --> 02:04:31.865]  But researching the New World Order, at its heart, there's something more there.
[02:04:31.865 --> 02:04:33.086]  There's something deeper there.
[02:04:38.649 --> 02:04:43.132]  So we'll see what happens on that front, but I do think it's good.
[02:04:43.132 --> 02:04:51.156]  It's good that these big modern militaries that are bombing and attacking people living in caveman-level existences needs to stop.
[02:04:51.156 --> 02:04:56.299]  So I wonder if they'll be issued war crimes charges against Bush and Cheney.
[02:04:56.299 --> 02:04:58.040]  Because boy, do they deserve it.
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:58.941]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.941 --> 02:04:59.381]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.581 --> 02:05:04.604]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.604 --> 02:05:09.929]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.929 --> 02:05:11.971]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:16.976]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:17.877]  How much do you want?
[02:05:18.157 --> 02:05:19.278]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.278 --> 02:05:21.159]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:21.159 --> 02:05:22.220]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:24.441]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.441 --> 02:05:25.782]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.782 --> 02:05:27.303]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.303 --> 02:05:32.567]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.567 --> 02:05:36.149]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:39.632]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.972 --> 02:05:41.193]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.193 --> 02:05:42.094]  We don't know.
[02:05:42.094 --> 02:05:43.196]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.196 --> 02:05:44.137]  All you can get.
[02:05:44.137 --> 02:05:45.238]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.238 --> 02:05:48.281]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.281 --> 02:05:50.063]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:50.063 --> 02:05:50.984]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.555 --> 02:06:04.679]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:06:04.679 --> 02:06:07.561]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:06:07.561 --> 02:06:09.643]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:06:09.643 --> 02:06:11.885]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:06:11.885 --> 02:06:13.527]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:06:48.356 --> 02:06:50.277]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:07:00.396 --> 02:07:05.702]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.702 --> 02:07:10.247]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.247 --> 02:07:12.510]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:14.132]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.132 --> 02:07:15.173]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.393 --> 02:07:23.815]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:07:31.277 --> 02:07:36.919]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.259 --> 02:07:37.819]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.478 --> 02:08:09.239]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.239 --> 02:08:11.000]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.580]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:14.141]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.141 --> 02:08:18.323]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:24.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.105 --> 02:08:30.508]  The last caller brought up a headline
[02:08:32.014 --> 02:08:32.314]  I think?
[02:08:51.401 --> 02:08:55.765]  Well Israel, I mean the government of England doesn't control its courts if they're impartial.
[02:09:10.498 --> 02:09:26.031]  It has emerged that a London court issued a warrant at the weekend for alleged war crimes committed last winter's Gaza offensive, and then rescinded it when it became clear that Giuseppe Levini was not on British soil.
[02:09:26.031 --> 02:09:32.476]  So, there you have it.
[02:09:32.476 --> 02:09:35.259]  Okay, let me, like I said, I would finish up with the news.
[02:09:36.588 --> 02:09:39.949]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:09:39.949 --> 02:09:47.832]  I just want to say thank you for the things that you've done.
[02:09:47.832 --> 02:09:55.835]  I saw Endgame about a year ago on the internet and ever since then I've been doing my studying and researching and I appreciate everything you're doing.
[02:09:55.835 --> 02:09:57.015]  God bless you.
[02:09:57.015 --> 02:09:57.676]  Thank you.
[02:09:57.676 --> 02:10:04.498]  And I just want to ask, is Codex Alimentary going to go into effect on December 31st of this year?
[02:10:05.899 --> 02:10:09.662]  People for 20 years have been saying it's going into effect every year.
[02:10:09.662 --> 02:10:13.006]  It's going into effect in increments.
[02:10:13.006 --> 02:10:15.608]  Like a glacier grows.
[02:10:15.608 --> 02:10:18.010]  The UN has these big consortium meetings.
[02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:28.800]  Governments and private corporations sign agreements to go back and try to restrict minerals, vitamins, and other things to the public.
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:31.463]  And yes, they've agreed to try to implement
[02:10:32.748 --> 02:10:36.872]  Massive restrictions on all vitamins and minerals to make them prescription.
[02:10:36.872 --> 02:10:44.658]  Big drug companies are now coming out with their prescription versions of vitamin E and vitamin B and fish oil.
[02:10:44.658 --> 02:10:48.362]  And they have tried to raid alternative health places.
[02:10:48.362 --> 02:10:50.203]  They are trying to shut them down.
[02:10:50.203 --> 02:10:52.245]  They are trying to restrict.
[02:10:52.245 --> 02:11:00.292]  And it's a process, but it's kind of like seven years ago, Bush signed, and Republicans went along with him and passed,
[02:11:01.942 --> 02:11:10.970]  The so-called campaign finance reform, which increased the money corporations could give, but restricted individuals.
[02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:13.272]  So the public was told, though, this is going to stop.
[02:11:13.272 --> 02:11:21.599]  And that law states that six weeks before an election, I can't talk about politics as a radio host.
[02:11:21.599 --> 02:11:25.782]  I can't have a pro-gun group on, an anti-gun group on.
[02:11:25.782 --> 02:11:29.826]  I can't have a politician on.
[02:11:31.581 --> 02:11:33.002]  But everyone just ignores it.
[02:11:33.002 --> 02:11:35.423]  It's clearly unconstitutional and a fraud.
[02:11:35.423 --> 02:11:44.648]  It's like if the government passed a law today saying, murder your firstborn, like many ancient cultures would do, as a test of power over the slaves.
[02:11:44.648 --> 02:11:49.490]  Or when the slaves bred too much, they would routinely kill children.
[02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:50.511]  I mean, that's what governments do.
[02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:51.771]  That's what eugenics says.
[02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:53.012]  The public just hasn't figured out.
[02:11:53.012 --> 02:11:56.293]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[02:11:56.293 --> 02:12:00.576]  And so, you know, that's basically what's happening here.
[02:12:00.576 --> 02:12:01.016]  Anything else?
[02:12:02.202 --> 02:12:18.310]  Well, I live in Indianapolis and they just recently put up that, uh, systems where if a firearm gets shot, they, um, they'll ping it and find out exactly where it's at and what type of weapon it is and it's going to cost our city like $3 million or $4 million.
[02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:21.651]  That's total quackery.
[02:12:21.651 --> 02:12:31.336]  Austin put that in in 1998, but they've never busted anyone for discharging a firearm with the gun detection system.
[02:12:35.289 --> 02:12:39.190]  What it is is shotgun microphones on cameras.
[02:12:39.190 --> 02:12:47.153]  And then you'll find that's hooked into your local threat integration center where they're openly merging it with the regular army and CIA.
[02:12:47.153 --> 02:12:48.314]  This is all public now.
[02:12:48.314 --> 02:12:51.095]  I've got the RAND Corporation report on it.
[02:12:51.095 --> 02:12:52.795]  Here it is right here.
[02:12:52.795 --> 02:12:54.816]  Total federalization of all police.
[02:12:56.343 --> 02:12:58.365]  And just a fraud.
[02:12:58.365 --> 02:13:01.587]  But I tell you, Indiana is way ahead of the times.
[02:13:01.587 --> 02:13:07.171]  Indiana was the first state, almost 20 years ago, to put in license plate reading cameras.
[02:13:07.171 --> 02:13:11.894]  Did you know that for more than 15 years, everywhere you go is tracked in Indiana?
[02:13:11.894 --> 02:13:12.815]  Yeah, I know.
[02:13:12.815 --> 02:13:15.236]  It's bad everywhere downtown and anywhere.
[02:13:15.236 --> 02:13:16.677]  You can see it all, all the cameras.
[02:13:16.677 --> 02:13:18.378]  It's really bad here.
[02:13:18.378 --> 02:13:24.723]  And one last thing I wanted to say, have you kind of noticed that the new Alcantara spokesman, the American, Adam Gadon,
[02:13:26.385 --> 02:13:26.945]  Well, of course!
[02:13:26.945 --> 02:13:28.966]  I mean, we've written countless articles about it.
[02:13:28.966 --> 02:13:30.507]  Yeah, he, he, he... Mm-hmm.
[02:13:30.507 --> 02:13:33.209]  ...is dead.
[02:13:33.209 --> 02:13:35.490]  Do you believe he is?
[02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:37.271]  Uh, your phone cut out.
[02:13:37.271 --> 02:13:37.751]  Say that again?
[02:13:37.751 --> 02:13:40.593]  I believe Bin Laden is dead.
[02:13:40.593 --> 02:13:41.433]  That's what I believe.
[02:13:41.433 --> 02:13:41.853]  Oh, sure, sure.
[02:13:41.853 --> 02:13:43.814]  No, no, we've... Adam is... Yeah, look, yeah.
[02:13:43.814 --> 02:13:44.815]  I gotta move on, Curtis.
[02:13:44.815 --> 02:13:45.875]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:45.875 --> 02:13:46.916]  I really do.
[02:13:46.916 --> 02:13:51.919]  Um... Adam Gadon hated Arabs so much.
[02:13:51.919 --> 02:13:52.439]  He's Jewish.
[02:13:54.485 --> 02:13:59.549]  He hated Arabs so much that he was arrested beating them up outside Mosque.
[02:13:59.549 --> 02:14:03.972]  I mean, this guy was a super mega Zionist.
[02:14:03.972 --> 02:14:08.576]  His grandfather was one of the founders of the ADL, one of their board members.
[02:14:09.756 --> 02:14:14.338]  And he gets up there and apologizes that Al Qaeda is killing innocent people.
[02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:20.960]  I mean, he's been caught when they uploaded the Intel Center, openly run by former heads of black ops from CIA.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.120]  That's on record.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:31.423]  The Intel Center uploads Gadahn videos and other videos in the same video layer as the Intel Center's bug, the Intel Center's graphics.
[02:14:31.423 --> 02:14:35.005]  It is, they are producing it.
[02:14:35.005 --> 02:14:36.265]  I mean, they were caught red-handed.
[02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.419]  We've blown their videos up here.
[02:14:41.419 --> 02:14:44.301]  They've had video experts for Wired Magazine and others look at it.
[02:14:44.301 --> 02:14:49.944]  But you can blow up video layers if you've got a computer and look at it.
[02:14:49.944 --> 02:14:53.987]  And it's done on the same layer, the same generation.
[02:14:53.987 --> 02:14:57.569]  The pixel shapes change per generation and per encode.
[02:14:57.569 --> 02:14:59.531]  I don't know how to get into all the technicals for you.
[02:14:59.531 --> 02:15:01.372]  The point is, it's clearer than fingerprints.
[02:15:02.259 --> 02:15:10.263]  And the CIA thinks it's funny they get a young Jewish Mossad guy up there and he wears a turban and says, I will get you America.
[02:15:10.263 --> 02:15:11.143]  We're going to kill you.
[02:15:11.143 --> 02:15:12.544]  Give up all your rights.
[02:15:12.544 --> 02:15:13.804]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:15:13.804 --> 02:15:18.406]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:15:18.406 --> 02:15:19.987]  He's almost laughing when he's talking.
[02:15:19.987 --> 02:15:22.528]  It's such a bad actor.
[02:15:22.528 --> 02:15:25.589]  But he's doing important work for the New World Order.
[02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:26.410]  Let's talk to
[02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:33.391]  Because remember, this isn't about Muslims, even if you hate Muslims.
[02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:38.093]  Homeland Security is for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[02:15:38.093 --> 02:15:38.753]  Remember that.
[02:15:38.753 --> 02:15:41.234]  We have the official Homeland Security internal documents.
[02:15:41.234 --> 02:15:43.495]  It's all about you.
[02:15:43.495 --> 02:15:44.455]  You're the slave.
[02:15:44.455 --> 02:15:46.036]  You're the property of the bankers.
[02:15:46.036 --> 02:15:47.356]  They know they're committing crimes.
[02:15:47.356 --> 02:15:49.197]  They know you're going to resist it.
[02:15:49.197 --> 02:15:51.518]  So the Pentagon's watching, okay?
[02:15:51.518 --> 02:15:53.439]  They're there to make sure the crime continues.
[02:15:54.636 --> 02:15:56.558]  That doesn't mean our military's bad.
[02:15:56.558 --> 02:16:00.141]  It means those running it are running it for those aims, period.
[02:16:00.141 --> 02:16:01.802]  Our military's been hijacked.
[02:16:01.802 --> 02:16:06.006]  Just like when Hitler hijacked the German military.
[02:16:06.006 --> 02:16:08.969]  And you better grow up and admit that.
[02:16:08.969 --> 02:16:13.373]  But yeah, having the ADL heads' grandsons run around, it's just so ridiculous.
[02:16:13.373 --> 02:16:16.615]  And the media never talks about it, but it's admitted if you drill in.
[02:16:16.615 --> 02:16:18.657]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:16:18.657 --> 02:16:20.259]  Let's talk to Francis in Canada.
[02:16:20.259 --> 02:16:21.159]  Francis, you're on the air.
[02:16:21.159 --> 02:16:21.480]  Go ahead.
[02:16:22.930 --> 02:16:23.811]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:23.811 --> 02:16:25.932]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:25.932 --> 02:16:34.579]  I was wondering if you could help me confirm or deny a rumor I've been looking into about your favorite human being, George Soros.
[02:16:34.579 --> 02:16:45.688]  And what I'm hearing is that early in his career, during World War II, he was pushing forged British pounds for the SS.
[02:16:45.688 --> 02:16:47.770]  He was a collaborator with the SS.
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:17:00.227]  Yeah, that's what Bob Chapman... I need to have him flesh that out.
[02:17:00.227 --> 02:17:09.453]  He's not on the next few weeks because of the holidays, but when he gets back in the first of the year, or he may be on before then, I can ask him to elaborate.
[02:17:09.453 --> 02:17:13.676]  I know that Soros is an arch-criminal, posing as a liberal.
[02:17:15.103 --> 02:17:25.049]  And I know that Madeleine Albright's dad robbed people for the Soviets in Czechoslovakia and was a war criminal.
[02:17:25.049 --> 02:17:33.174]  And I know that John Shelley Cashvely, who was the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I know his dad was the head Nazi in Poland.
[02:17:33.174 --> 02:17:41.699]  And so I do know that huge fortunes were made by some European Jews, books have been written on this, off robbing other Jews and working with the Nazis.
[02:17:43.058 --> 02:17:50.260]  And there's been actually some books written by, one of them's a famous, we ought to get him on, he's a Jewish professor in New York City.
[02:17:50.260 --> 02:18:04.224]  He went and actually got the documents where some Zionist groups wouldn't let Jews get out to England or the U.S., they would make them pay millions to the Zionist groups, and they'd split it with the Nazis, and only let them go to Palestine.
[02:18:04.224 --> 02:18:07.665]  And you see that with any of these type groups.
[02:18:07.665 --> 02:18:12.607]  The leadership of all these hereditary or religious groups is always feeding on their members.
[02:18:14.099 --> 02:18:18.644]  Feeding on them and it's just it's horrible.
[02:18:18.644 --> 02:18:20.226]  It's just absolutely horrible.
[02:18:20.226 --> 02:18:25.411]  I mean it makes Madoff and what he did to Jewish groups look tame.
[02:18:25.411 --> 02:18:28.114]  But I don't have any proof of that.
[02:18:28.114 --> 02:18:29.216]  I haven't fleshed that out.
[02:18:29.216 --> 02:18:31.358]  But I believe Bob.
[02:18:31.358 --> 02:18:34.461]  I mean Bob's always pretty accurate here.
[02:18:34.461 --> 02:18:34.922]  What do you think?
[02:18:36.766 --> 02:18:42.909]  Well, apparently the British tried to extradite him right after the war for pushing their forged British pounds.
[02:18:42.909 --> 02:18:43.809]  Yeah, what's your source?
[02:18:43.809 --> 02:18:45.970]  I mean, you're asking me, I'm asking you.
[02:18:45.970 --> 02:18:47.511]  Well, I've been looking on the internet.
[02:18:47.511 --> 02:18:49.832]  I've been researching this on the internet.
[02:18:49.832 --> 02:18:55.754]  And apparently the British tried to extradite him from Israel, like around 1948 when it was just created.
[02:18:55.754 --> 02:19:01.117]  And a young Golda Meir, who was Minister of Justice, denied the British the right to extradite him.
[02:19:01.604 --> 02:19:05.847]  Yeah, well you don't want to persecute a real Nazi if you find one.
[02:19:05.847 --> 02:19:08.308]  Only fake ones for the public consumption.
[02:19:08.308 --> 02:19:15.113]  Just like with Al-Qaeda, I don't arrest real Al-Qaeda, I arrest a 14-year-old, torture them for 8 years and have them confess to crimes they publicly couldn't have committed.
[02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:17.675]  Crimes that were committed after they were incarcerated.
[02:19:17.675 --> 02:19:21.397]  But specifically, did you find that in a mainstream article?
[02:19:21.397 --> 02:19:22.578]  Or did you find a document?
[02:19:22.578 --> 02:19:25.380]  Because just because somebody says something on the internet doesn't mean it's true.
[02:19:26.578 --> 02:19:28.960]  Well, that's what I was trying to get you to... Yeah, I don't know.
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.401]  I'll have to look into that more.
[02:19:30.401 --> 02:19:33.583]  I'll have to look into that more.
[02:19:33.583 --> 02:19:40.447]  Next time Bob's on, I'll... Let's email Bob and remind him he's not on the next two Fridays.
[02:19:40.447 --> 02:19:41.008]  When he's back...
[02:19:42.778 --> 02:19:46.220]  We need to make sure he has an email that we want to talk about that.
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:49.401]  People want to know the proof in the pudding on that subject.
[02:19:49.401 --> 02:19:51.922]  Thank you, caller.
[02:19:51.922 --> 02:19:56.304]  Larry, Ash, Paul, I'll take those three calls and I'm getting into news and video clips.
[02:19:56.304 --> 02:20:01.886]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.886 --> 02:20:04.007]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:20:04.007 --> 02:20:08.789]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:20:09.850 --> 02:20:17.940]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:21.721]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[02:20:21.721 --> 02:20:26.842]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:20:26.842 --> 02:20:30.844]  Far safer than colloidal silvers and silver hydrosol.
[02:20:30.844 --> 02:20:33.405]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:20:33.405 --> 02:20:38.306]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:20:38.306 --> 02:20:42.047]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:20:42.047 --> 02:20:44.268]  So get it while you still can.
[02:20:44.268 --> 02:20:47.069]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.
[02:20:48.189 --> 02:20:51.772]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[02:20:51.772 --> 02:20:54.894]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:20:54.894 --> 02:20:57.556]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:20:57.556 --> 02:20:59.237]  Order OxySilver today.
[02:20:59.237 --> 02:21:00.698]  This call could save your life.
[02:21:02.845 --> 02:21:06.867]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.867 --> 02:21:10.108]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:10.108 --> 02:21:15.250]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:15.250 --> 02:21:18.752]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[02:21:19.392 --> 02:21:21.273]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:21.273 --> 02:21:26.497]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:26.497 --> 02:21:29.759]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:21:29.759 --> 02:21:36.603]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:36.603 --> 02:21:38.945]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.945 --> 02:21:40.546]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:40.546 --> 02:21:42.987]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.987 --> 02:21:45.129]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:45.129 --> 02:21:46.650]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:21:47.350 --> 02:21:50.252]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:50.252 --> 02:21:59.337]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:22:01.266 --> 02:22:05.371]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[02:22:05.371 --> 02:22:09.637]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:22:09.637 --> 02:22:11.219]  You get less for your money.
[02:22:11.219 --> 02:22:17.066]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[02:22:17.987 --> 02:22:19.368]  We're good to go.
[02:22:43.268 --> 02:22:43.568]  Thank you.
[02:23:01.388 --> 02:23:03.809]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:23:03.809 --> 02:23:05.710]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:07.570]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[02:23:07.570 --> 02:23:08.991]  We paid off all of our bills.
[02:23:08.991 --> 02:23:11.792]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[02:23:11.792 --> 02:23:17.434]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:23:17.434 --> 02:23:19.114]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:23:19.114 --> 02:23:21.775]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:23:21.775 --> 02:23:22.175]  NoMoreMortgage.
[02:23:24.216 --> 02:23:25.497]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:23:25.497 --> 02:23:27.999]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:31.881]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:23:31.881 --> 02:23:34.043]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.
[02:23:34.043 --> 02:23:39.366]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[02:23:49.473 --> 02:23:49.793]  Call the number.

[02:23:55.157 --> 02:23:56.638]  I wish a buck was still silver, it was back
[02:24:18.638 --> 02:24:23.702]  We've got a new story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:23.702 --> 02:24:29.766]  Chuck Norris says Obama should be impeached if he tries to enforce Copenhagen Agreement.
[02:24:29.766 --> 02:24:34.130]  Actor and political activist warns that globalists want to bankrupt America and kill the dollar.
[02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:40.011]  It is a high-powered, hardcore interview with Chuck Norris we did live yesterday.
[02:24:40.011 --> 02:24:43.452]  This story can wake up a lot of mainline Republicans.
[02:24:43.452 --> 02:24:45.232]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:24:45.232 --> 02:24:47.872]  Every mind you unlock is a victory.
[02:24:47.872 --> 02:24:51.913]  Remember, none of us have to beat the globalists overnight by ourselves.
[02:24:51.913 --> 02:24:57.374]  It's all of us doing a little bit every day, resisting, that's going to beat these people.
[02:24:57.374 --> 02:25:00.695]  Look at how we're fighting man-made global climate change, proving it's a fraud.
[02:25:02.142 --> 02:25:11.586]  They've gone from arrogantly looking like they couldn't be stopped to blowing up, crashing and burning in front of us.
[02:25:11.586 --> 02:25:20.469]  When we get frenzied like a wolf pack and go after these people on issues, we cannot be beaten.
[02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:22.350]  Let's go ahead and talk to Larry in Texas.
[02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:23.210]  Larry, you're on the air.
[02:25:23.210 --> 02:25:24.670]  Welcome.
[02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:25.671]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:25.671 --> 02:25:26.531]  Hey, buddy.
[02:25:26.531 --> 02:25:28.112]  I'm sorry, I've been out of pocket.
[02:25:28.112 --> 02:25:29.412]  I don't know if you covered this or not.
[02:25:29.412 --> 02:25:31.273]  The latest New London, Connecticut news.
[02:25:32.346 --> 02:25:33.746]  About a week ago.
[02:25:33.746 --> 02:25:39.368]  Well, they, uh, about a week ago CBS News had a... Right, Pfizer decided they're not going to spend a dime on developing it.
[02:25:39.368 --> 02:25:39.448]  Yeah.
[02:25:55.137 --> 02:25:57.622]  It's like going and visiting a dead relative's grave.
[02:25:57.622 --> 02:25:59.064]  I don't really like doing it.
[02:25:59.064 --> 02:26:02.671]  It's like, yeah, they just said, we'll take your property even if we don't use it.
[02:26:02.671 --> 02:26:04.214]  We have SWAT teams, they love to murder.
[02:26:05.339 --> 02:26:07.060]  Yeah, they interviewed the ex-mayor.
[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:12.003]  He sounded pretty glum, and one of the homeowners standing in the field where his house used to stand.
[02:26:12.003 --> 02:26:27.472]  Well, they would do stuff like, the town is so criminal that they would, this is hundreds of homes, whatever, 300, they would rev, because we had all the families on, rev bulldozers at midnight and threaten them, and then the town got the courts to, people didn't really read the Supreme Court ruling.
[02:26:28.494 --> 02:26:33.118]  The Supreme Court didn't just say private interest can have your land.
[02:26:33.118 --> 02:26:39.783]  They said we don't have to pay you, and you can be made to pay lawyer fees if you don't immediately just give it up.
[02:26:39.783 --> 02:26:50.931]  So they come after you, you fight back, you've got to pay lawyer fees, on top of having your half-million-dollar, three-story, Victorian, middle-class home.
[02:26:50.931 --> 02:26:54.214]  I mean, they've always been persecuting poor people.
[02:26:54.214 --> 02:26:56.576]  But I mean, this was, you know, middle-class area.
[02:26:57.476 --> 02:27:00.717]  And they just said, we'll take what we want and we're not going to pay you.
[02:27:00.717 --> 02:27:11.480]  And the Supreme Court ruled that money can be given by lobbying groups to city councils, county commissioners, state houses.
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:15.641]  Bribery is now legal to pay to take your land.
[02:27:15.641 --> 02:27:18.242]  How do you like that?
[02:27:18.242 --> 02:27:19.502]  Great to be American.
[02:27:19.502 --> 02:27:26.404]  Hey, our county here bumps up against Louisiana and we get the Louisiana News only and Barksdale
[02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:31.854]  Air Force Base, where that plane landed with missing nuke.
[02:27:32.928 --> 02:27:34.189]  Two missing nukes.
[02:27:34.189 --> 02:27:34.470]  Right.
[02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:41.875]  The base commander that raised the stink, they ran him off and replaced him with the commander from North Dakota.
[02:27:41.875 --> 02:27:42.436]  That's right.
[02:27:42.436 --> 02:27:49.722]  And nine people involved with loading them who are witnesses all committed suicide or were murdered.
[02:27:49.722 --> 02:27:54.645]  And that was clearly a deal where they were trying to switch nukes out and claim Al Qaeda got them.
[02:27:54.645 --> 02:27:55.947]  But thank God people blew the whistle.
[02:27:55.947 --> 02:28:00.110]  But next time they'll have the right people in place to make sure that nuke goes off in America.
[02:28:01.215 --> 02:28:01.855]  One last thing.
[02:28:01.855 --> 02:28:30.174]  You think, uh, people, when you tell them the truth, our fellow citizens, they may not understand it, but if you gave it to them in a sarcastic way, for instance, uh, to start a chapter like the East Texas chapter of Bootlickers of America, and, uh, you know... Yeah, we worship cameras, we worship forced inoculations, we hate due process, and we burn constitutions.
[02:28:30.174 --> 02:28:30.755]  If we can, uh,
[02:28:31.397 --> 02:28:36.815]  If you like the ice cream joint and get 32 flavors of boot polish, you can ask people what's their flavor.
[02:28:38.208 --> 02:28:39.949]  That's all I got for you today.
[02:28:39.949 --> 02:28:40.830]  That is smart.
[02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:46.573]  Now that's a smart... Of course, it wouldn't really be bootlickers, but make, like, a fake online ad.
[02:28:46.573 --> 02:28:48.255]  Bootlickers of America.
[02:28:48.255 --> 02:28:50.756]  And you can have, like, the 31 flavors.
[02:28:50.756 --> 02:28:52.497]  Like, take my kids.
[02:28:52.497 --> 02:28:53.898]  I love it.
[02:28:53.898 --> 02:28:56.100]  Raise my taxes for bankers.
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:57.380]  I love handing in my guns.
[02:28:57.380 --> 02:29:01.083]  I want to live like a slave in Chicago with the highest crime rate.
[02:29:01.083 --> 02:29:02.284]  Poison my water.
[02:29:02.284 --> 02:29:03.985]  I love brain damaging my children.
[02:29:04.810 --> 02:29:09.412]  And then with a picture of a person drinking poison water.
[02:29:09.412 --> 02:29:11.292]  Cops running checkpoints.
[02:29:11.292 --> 02:29:13.173]  I love killing freedom.
[02:29:13.173 --> 02:29:15.393]  I love being a traitor.
[02:29:15.393 --> 02:29:18.715]  I love tyranny.
[02:29:18.715 --> 02:29:23.436]  Yeah, you can come up with 31 flavors pretty easy.
[02:29:23.436 --> 02:29:26.417]  Oh God, help me.
[02:29:26.417 --> 02:29:28.838]  These are always crazy shows when I sit here just taking calls.
[02:29:34.605 --> 02:29:37.866]  More calls and the video clips in the news straight ahead.
[02:29:37.866 --> 02:29:41.168]  Right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:41.168 --> 02:29:47.951]  Please stay with us as we continue to chronicle the fall of our Republic into the scientific dictatorship.
[02:29:47.951 --> 02:29:49.512]  But that doesn't really matter.
[02:29:49.512 --> 02:29:51.032]  The Cowboys haven't had a good season.
[02:29:51.032 --> 02:29:52.073]  That's what matters.
[02:29:52.073 --> 02:29:53.473]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.473 --> 02:29:55.995]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.995 --> 02:29:58.696]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.223 --> 02:30:05.785]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.785 --> 02:30:06.685]  Number one.
[02:30:06.685 --> 02:30:10.127]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.127 --> 02:30:10.967]  Number two.
[02:30:10.967 --> 02:30:15.869]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.869 --> 02:30:16.609]  It's true.
[02:30:16.609 --> 02:30:21.171]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.471 --> 02:30:22.312]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.312 --> 02:30:25.895]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.895 --> 02:30:29.819]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.819 --> 02:30:30.599]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.599 --> 02:30:33.362]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.362 --> 02:30:37.045]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.045 --> 02:30:37.846]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.846 --> 02:30:41.990]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:46.754]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.034 --> 02:30:51.200]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:52.982]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.982 --> 02:30:55.245]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:55.245 --> 02:30:57.588]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.701 --> 02:31:04.703]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.703 --> 02:31:10.026]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:10.026 --> 02:31:12.087]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:12.087 --> 02:31:17.089]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:17.089 --> 02:31:18.270]  How much do you want?
[02:31:18.270 --> 02:31:19.391]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.391 --> 02:31:21.272]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:22.352]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.352 --> 02:31:24.554]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.554 --> 02:31:25.894]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.894 --> 02:31:27.195]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.415 --> 02:31:32.678]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.678 --> 02:31:36.261]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:36.261 --> 02:31:40.083]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:40.083 --> 02:31:41.304]  How much will you need?
[02:31:41.304 --> 02:31:42.204]  We don't know.
[02:31:42.204 --> 02:31:43.305]  How much do you want?
[02:31:43.305 --> 02:31:44.065]  All you can get.
[02:31:44.065 --> 02:31:44.946]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:45.326 --> 02:31:48.390]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:48.390 --> 02:31:51.233]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:51.233 --> 02:31:51.994]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.618 --> 02:32:05.925]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:05.925 --> 02:32:10.471]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:10.471 --> 02:32:12.734]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:12.734 --> 02:32:14.356]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:14.356 --> 02:32:15.398]  There is a solution.
[02:32:15.618 --> 02:32:24.047]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:32:24.047 --> 02:32:31.515]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:32:31.515 --> 02:32:37.161]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:32:37.521 --> 02:32:43.566]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:32:43.566 --> 02:32:47.710]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:55.176]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:32:55.176 --> 02:32:58.499]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:33:09.276 --> 02:33:17.385]  Okay.
[02:33:17.385 --> 02:33:25.694]  I want to play some video clips and cover Climategate, the latest developments on that right now.
[02:33:28.288 --> 02:33:31.150]  Then we're going to go back to Ash, Paul, Roger, and others.
[02:33:31.150 --> 02:33:33.931]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:33.931 --> 02:33:34.051]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:34.051 --> 02:33:40.515]  And the first clip I'm going to be playing in a little while, guys, is the first time the journalist is at the UN Conference in Copenhagen Friday.
[02:33:56.448 --> 02:34:07.870]  And he simply wants to ask a question, he gets up to the microphone, and they flip out on him and start taking his camera away and telling other camera people don't tape this at a press conference.
[02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:17.212]  Now, Al Gore got questioned by the same reporter, he starts running from him, and the police grab the guy's microphone cable and unplug it.
[02:34:17.212 --> 02:34:22.653]  I mean, the UN, they openly want to shut down Free Speech Worldwide.
[02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:24.893]  This is an authoritarian criminal group.
[02:34:26.732 --> 02:34:29.833]  I mean, they laud the communist Chinese system.
[02:34:29.833 --> 02:34:32.913]  They want you to live under a one-child policy.
[02:34:32.913 --> 02:34:36.494]  They want you bankrupt in their own statements.
[02:34:36.494 --> 02:34:38.414]  What is it about this?
[02:34:38.414 --> 02:34:39.955]  I'm just so sick of these people.
[02:34:39.955 --> 02:34:41.955]  I just want to arrest them.
[02:34:41.955 --> 02:34:43.535]  They have committed crimes.
[02:34:43.535 --> 02:34:46.636]  They have called to commit bigger conspiracies.
[02:34:46.636 --> 02:34:51.057]  Maury Strong stole billions himself in the UN food for
[02:34:52.097 --> 02:34:53.258]  Oil program?
[02:34:53.258 --> 02:34:55.720]  And made sure they never got the food because he stole the money?
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:02.506]  I mean, this is a murdering piece of trash!
[02:35:02.506 --> 02:35:04.567]  Alright, I'm not going to start ranting.
[02:35:04.567 --> 02:35:10.372]  See, the minute I start thinking about these articles, steam starts coming out of my ears.
[02:35:10.372 --> 02:35:12.214]  But I want to comment on Tiger Woods first.
[02:35:14.551 --> 02:35:18.712]  When I say we're receiving hundreds of emails, we receive thousands and thousands a day.
[02:35:18.712 --> 02:35:22.814]  I'm receiving hundreds asking me what I think about Tiger Woods.
[02:35:22.814 --> 02:35:28.796]  And so I'll tell you what I think about Tiger Woods here in just a moment.
[02:35:28.796 --> 02:35:34.458]  First off, I want to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:35:34.458 --> 02:35:40.580]  And one of them is Diginet.net, personal audio video recorder.
[02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:44.853]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:35:44.853 --> 02:35:47.935]  Diginet dot net.
[02:35:47.935 --> 02:35:52.098]  They have a giant list of products at the lowest prices I've seen them.
[02:35:52.098 --> 02:35:54.000]  Because I've bought these systems.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.621]  Previous to them being a sponsor.
[02:35:55.621 --> 02:35:58.243]  They have the Diginet spy glasses.
[02:35:58.243 --> 02:36:01.526]  Hidden memory card and camera in the glasses.
[02:36:01.526 --> 02:36:03.788]  You can't get any better than this.
[02:36:03.788 --> 02:36:05.349]  They've got the Diginet pens.
[02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:06.290]  They're very affordable.
[02:36:06.290 --> 02:36:07.851]  Record audio and video.
[02:36:07.851 --> 02:36:09.012]  Diginet dot net.
[02:36:09.012 --> 02:36:09.873]  That's Diginet.
[02:36:11.523 --> 02:36:16.125]  Also, I want to tell you about My Solar Backup.
[02:36:16.125 --> 02:36:23.629]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:36:23.629 --> 02:36:28.091]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com.
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:40.642]  Because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generating your own supply of electrical power.
[02:36:40.642 --> 02:36:41.682]  Here's why.
[02:36:41.682 --> 02:36:45.063]  Plug and play solar generators are now available for solutions from science.
[02:36:45.063 --> 02:36:51.626]  Their portable power systems need no installation and supply household current wherever and whenever you want it.
[02:36:51.626 --> 02:36:53.327]  Producing electricity directly from the sun.
[02:36:53.327 --> 02:36:55.568]  And it's got batteries too.
[02:36:55.568 --> 02:36:58.929]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly and emits no fumes.
[02:37:00.387 --> 02:37:01.188]  That's too bad, though.
[02:37:01.188 --> 02:37:04.494]  We actually need more of that for the Earth's atmosphere.
[02:37:04.494 --> 02:37:05.836]  Continuing... I'm joking.
[02:37:07.214 --> 02:37:12.558]  It's like having your own electric power plant and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[02:37:12.558 --> 02:37:19.342]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:37:19.342 --> 02:37:24.845]  So go to MySolarBackup.com to request the free information package today.
[02:37:24.845 --> 02:37:26.206]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:37:26.206 --> 02:37:26.266]  877-327-0365.
[02:37:26.266 --> 02:37:27.447]  Okay, thank you to those sponsors.
[02:37:39.901 --> 02:38:03.937]  Alright, there has been a new event, and I've talked to countless reporters, we've played videos of George Soros, openly funded groups, Rockefeller, UN funded groups, come to the little climate change skeptics meetings that aren't funded by BP and Exxon and Mobil and Dutch Rochelle and Amoco, and they just take over the events.
[02:38:03.937 --> 02:38:08.660]  They take over the microphones, they yell, they scream, they take over the media, the police never stop them.
[02:38:12.611 --> 02:38:22.394]  But the UN is just this private criminal holding group and it just does whatever it wants.
[02:38:22.394 --> 02:38:33.398]  And so they have IPCC meetings that are open to the public.
[02:38:36.559 --> 02:38:37.820]  Open to accredited media.
[02:38:57.236 --> 02:39:06.784]  The head of the IPCC's Climate Division says, well, because of the moral standing or the political views of the people that leaked the emails, I'm not going to discuss them.
[02:39:06.784 --> 02:39:08.165]  And plus, they're private.
[02:39:08.165 --> 02:39:11.948]  No, they were ordered to be released through FOIA requests, which they successfully blocked.
[02:39:11.948 --> 02:39:23.117]  These are the intergovernmental and inter-university emails where they're fixing the numbers, hiding the decline, and involved in persecuting other scientists.
[02:39:23.117 --> 02:39:25.659]  But notice this big UN thug
[02:39:26.431 --> 02:39:28.292]  This big ninny.
[02:39:28.292 --> 02:39:31.874]  Never seen a UN policeman that... I mean, they're all this ninny type.
[02:39:31.874 --> 02:39:33.635]  They're all like demonic Al Gore's.
[02:39:33.635 --> 02:39:35.516]  Man-bear-pigs.
[02:39:35.516 --> 02:39:40.099]  And they always... Keep getting emails, what's a man-bear-pig?
[02:39:40.099 --> 02:39:50.225]  It's a South Park episode where he makes up, been out for two years, where Al Gore comes to town to scare everybody to give him money, saying there's a creature that's half man, half bear, and half pig.
[02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:51.660]  It's 150%.
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:54.242]  And it's killing everyone.
[02:39:54.242 --> 02:39:55.382]  It's just all made up.
[02:39:55.382 --> 02:40:05.028]  The point is, global warming is as real as a man-bear-pig or blood-drinking toads from Planet Pop-Tart landing and sucking your brains out through a Curly Q straw.
[02:40:05.028 --> 02:40:06.168]  It isn't real.
[02:40:06.168 --> 02:40:07.669]  Okay?
[02:40:07.669 --> 02:40:09.430]  Man-bear-pig.
[02:40:09.430 --> 02:40:13.392]  But you try to confront man-bear-pig or any of his minions, this is what happens.
[02:40:13.392 --> 02:40:17.775]  This is accredited media at a press conference, up at the microphone.
[02:40:17.775 --> 02:40:18.215]  Here it is.
[02:40:18.215 --> 02:40:19.036]  And we'll get to the new clip.
[02:40:19.036 --> 02:40:19.316]  Here it is.
[02:40:19.773 --> 02:40:32.546]  What do you think of the behavior of Professor Phil Jones in asking colleagues to delete emails and the destruction of publicly funded data that was gathered by public funds?
[02:40:32.546 --> 02:40:36.790]  I don't know what he asked, what he said, I don't make comments.
[02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:40.053]  Back it up a few seconds.
[02:40:40.053 --> 02:40:43.517]  But this woman comes over and starts grabbing at his microphone.
[02:40:44.465 --> 02:40:47.207]  With this very angry look, like, give me that!
[02:40:47.207 --> 02:40:48.768]  I've been told to shut this down!
[02:40:48.768 --> 02:40:52.670]  And then he won't give it to her, so she scurries off and gets the guy with the uniform.
[02:40:52.670 --> 02:41:12.462]  Now, if you don't think that woman won't send police to take your second-born child under the carbon credit tax, now being proposed by governments worldwide, and by the IPCC, and the UN, if you don't think the security guard won't come in your house and take your guns,
[02:41:13.578 --> 02:41:19.941]  This is like the Pharaoh, Ramses, demanding all the firstborn children.
[02:41:19.941 --> 02:41:27.925]  Every major culture, from the Aztecs to the Egyptians to the Babylonians, would demand that people sacrifice their children.
[02:41:27.925 --> 02:41:29.525]  And it was always the lower class.
[02:41:29.525 --> 02:41:33.467]  The upper class said, there's too many of these people, kill them!
[02:41:33.467 --> 02:41:35.568]  And it's also an act of submission.
[02:41:35.568 --> 02:41:37.129]  Give me your child, yes.
[02:41:37.129 --> 02:41:39.370]  And 2,300 years ago, in the time of Plato,
[02:41:43.376 --> 02:41:51.942]  They would have wars with each other between the Greek states and write letters to each other about, yes, there's too many of our people and too many of yours.
[02:41:51.942 --> 02:41:53.403]  Let's have a war.
[02:41:53.403 --> 02:41:57.346]  And then like a chess game, they would sit back and watch the war.
[02:41:57.346 --> 02:41:58.547]  Oh, excellent shot.
[02:41:58.547 --> 02:41:59.688]  Hmm.
[02:41:59.688 --> 02:42:00.869]  It's all just entertainment.
[02:42:00.869 --> 02:42:02.170]  It's all staged.
[02:42:02.170 --> 02:42:04.892]  It was staged 2,300 years ago.
[02:42:04.892 --> 02:42:06.433]  It's staged now.
[02:42:06.433 --> 02:42:08.955]  Just start the clip from the start since I interrupted it.
[02:42:08.955 --> 02:42:11.557]  But first, first the info babe comes over.
[02:42:15.808 --> 02:42:17.470]  And then the next guy comes over.
[02:42:17.470 --> 02:42:24.579]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:42:24.579 --> 02:42:35.092]  What do you think of the behavior of Professor Phil Jones in asking colleagues to delete emails and the destruction of publicly funded data that was gathered by public funds?
[02:42:37.338 --> 02:42:39.599]  I don't know what he asked, what he said.
[02:42:39.599 --> 02:42:44.321]  I don't make comments on redacted emails presented to me by people whose values I don't trust.
[02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:45.162]  They were not redacted, liar!
[02:42:45.162 --> 02:42:48.484]  I would have to see the whole thing, so I cannot very well comment.
[02:42:48.484 --> 02:42:57.028]  What I can say is that private communications that people have between each other certainly are not public documents.
[02:42:57.028 --> 02:42:58.929]  That woman's got a brain the size of a walnut.
[02:43:02.271 --> 02:43:04.614]  Back it up again, I'm interrupting.
[02:43:04.614 --> 02:43:07.978]  Back it up until Walnut Brain comes over.
[02:43:07.978 --> 02:43:11.542]  Now Walnut Brain really believes she's saving the world.
[02:43:11.542 --> 02:43:16.188]  And then another Walnut Brain, the male UN police, these are UN police with guns.
[02:43:19.727 --> 02:43:25.210]  And Article 29 and 30 of the UN Charter of Declaration of Human Rights says you have no rights.
[02:43:25.210 --> 02:43:30.592]  And the UN, everywhere they go, rapes and murders and kills and runs giant child raping rings.
[02:43:30.592 --> 02:43:32.853]  I mean, it's mainly a pedophile guild.
[02:43:32.853 --> 02:43:34.634]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[02:43:34.634 --> 02:43:38.775]  Everywhere they go, they run around snatching everyone's kids.
[02:43:38.775 --> 02:43:42.437]  I could show you the UN roasting a five-year-old over a fire after they've been raped.
[02:43:45.128 --> 02:43:47.610]  That's an America destroyed by design.
[02:43:47.610 --> 02:43:49.372]  Shows a little boy all bloody and dead.
[02:43:49.372 --> 02:43:53.735]  And the UN smiling with his dead body.
[02:43:53.735 --> 02:43:55.597]  Or it shows him roasting another little kid to death.
[02:43:55.597 --> 02:43:58.759]  Let me tell you, they want to kill you and your family.
[02:43:58.759 --> 02:44:01.522]  Where do you think pedophile killers go?
[02:44:01.522 --> 02:44:02.482]  They go join the UN!
[02:44:04.471 --> 02:44:05.332]  Anyways, we don't know.
[02:44:05.332 --> 02:44:10.776]  This guy is just a thug who wants to violate free speech by accredited media.
[02:44:10.776 --> 02:44:12.418]  But let's go back to the UN.
[02:44:12.418 --> 02:44:13.118]  Here it is.
[02:44:13.118 --> 02:44:23.347]  What I can say is that private communications that people have between each other certainly are not public documents.
[02:44:23.347 --> 02:44:26.750]  But the university has confirmed they are accurate.
[02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:29.152]  Everybody says privately...
[02:44:31.178 --> 02:44:34.999]  Well, no, I agree, we'll make it short.
[02:44:34.999 --> 02:44:35.340]  Here we go!
[02:44:54.727 --> 02:44:57.009]  If you don't shut that off, I'm going to take it away from you.
[02:44:57.009 --> 02:44:58.690]  Sir, we are the press.
[02:44:58.690 --> 02:44:59.310]  I don't care.
[02:44:59.310 --> 02:45:02.413]  So, they kicked him out and wouldn't let him film.
[02:45:02.413 --> 02:45:08.197]  Now, that is a UN goon, obviously from New York, all the way over in another country, in Copenhagen, Denmark,
[02:45:24.795 --> 02:45:30.642]  With accredited press, at a press conference, asking their question.
[02:45:30.642 --> 02:45:32.344]  At their allotted time.
[02:45:32.344 --> 02:45:35.468]  Well, he can't get a question answered there.
[02:45:35.468 --> 02:45:44.058]  This fella's the filmmaker that made Not Evil, Just Wrong, which, pure evil, and wrong, should be the name of the, uh, I mean, Al Gore's a eugenicist.
[02:45:45.728 --> 02:45:53.550]  But you in Goon Silence journalist who questions Gore on ClimateGate and for TV viewers, for radio listeners, I'm going to play the audio.
[02:45:53.550 --> 02:46:00.753]  He's just trying to talk to Al Gore and the security guards go at the microphone and the camera and rip the cords out.
[02:46:00.753 --> 02:46:01.733]  And this has happened to us.
[02:46:02.904 --> 02:46:05.846]  Security guards and police are trained to go after the cameras.
[02:46:05.846 --> 02:46:10.149]  Hey, their face scanning cameras on us are great, but our cameras on them, that's bad.
[02:46:10.149 --> 02:46:13.170]  Because again, we are their property.
[02:46:13.170 --> 02:46:20.635]  They don't want a T-bone steak at the grocery store when they walk in to feed on something, jumping off the shelf and hitting them in the face.
[02:46:20.635 --> 02:46:22.856]  You're there to supply them!
[02:46:22.856 --> 02:46:25.098]  What is a slave doing with a camera on me?
[02:46:26.747 --> 02:46:28.349]  I think so little of you, slave!
[02:46:28.349 --> 02:46:33.636]  I'm gonna tell you polar bears can't swim, and the sun doesn't cause climate change.
[02:46:33.636 --> 02:46:35.779]  I'm gonna tell you penguins are drowning.
[02:46:35.779 --> 02:46:37.041]  Because you're idiots!
[02:46:37.041 --> 02:46:39.764]  Now lay there, steak, and let me cook your butt and eat you.
[02:46:41.041 --> 02:46:43.343]  I got men with guns here that say I rule you.
[02:46:43.343 --> 02:46:45.104]  You're gonna lay down and you're gonna take it.
[02:46:45.104 --> 02:46:47.366]  You understand that, boy?
[02:46:47.366 --> 02:46:49.468]  Land of the coward, home of the slaves!
[02:46:49.468 --> 02:46:51.549]  Lay down and take it!
[02:46:51.549 --> 02:46:54.372]  I got pot-bellied men with weapons!
[02:46:54.372 --> 02:46:56.433]  And the force to use them!
[02:46:56.433 --> 02:47:00.036]  And a cowardly public ready for to be raped!
[02:47:00.036 --> 02:47:01.077]  Let's go to Al Gore.
[02:47:01.077 --> 02:47:05.881]  Here it is.
[02:47:05.881 --> 02:47:09.604]  Again, this is the journalist asking Al Gore some inconvenient questions about Climategate.
[02:47:13.066 --> 02:47:16.427]  You've repeatedly said the oldest Climategate email is ten years old.
[02:47:16.427 --> 02:47:17.328]  It's actually two months.
[02:47:17.328 --> 02:47:19.528]  Will you correct the record?
[02:47:19.528 --> 02:47:21.749]  Excuse me, we're not doing interviews right now.
[02:47:21.749 --> 02:47:25.111]  Excuse me, we're not doing interviews right now.
[02:47:25.111 --> 02:47:29.752]  Excuse me, we're not doing interviews right now.
[02:47:29.752 --> 02:47:36.435]  The UN gets the microphone.
[02:47:36.435 --> 02:47:41.017]  UN Security pulls the cable from his microphone.
[02:47:41.017 --> 02:47:41.597]  Mickaliers
[02:47:43.732 --> 02:47:45.072]  Microphone.
[02:47:45.072 --> 02:47:47.553]  And this is what they did to my microphone.
[02:47:47.553 --> 02:47:53.856]  It seems you're not allowed to ask inconvenient questions of Al Gore.
[02:47:53.856 --> 02:47:57.037]  I really should have gone to this.
[02:47:57.037 --> 02:48:00.438]  I really... I need to... I just... I've got the radio to do.
[02:48:00.438 --> 02:48:04.519]  Can you imagine what would happen if we were in the middle of that circus?
[02:48:04.519 --> 02:48:11.782]  I mean, it would have been... And those UN guys are all really a piece of work.
[02:48:15.657 --> 02:48:18.679]  There's nothing more dangerous than a leftist with a gun.
[02:48:18.679 --> 02:48:21.842]  Because they're not leftists.
[02:48:21.842 --> 02:48:25.044]  These are Nazis posing as liberals.
[02:48:25.044 --> 02:48:30.989]  And the sooner you people figure that out, the better off you're going to be.
[02:48:30.989 --> 02:48:38.655]  On the subject of other UN information, inconvenient truth for Al Gore as his North Pole sums don't add up.
[02:48:39.713 --> 02:48:49.560]  It turns out, remember Al Gore three years ago said that by 2009, the summer, that the entire Arctic and Antarctic ice caps would be melted?
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:54.824]  Unfortunately, they grew by 24% according to NASA.
[02:48:54.824 --> 02:49:08.955]  But see, it doesn't stop Al Gore, again yesterday in a press conference, well not a press conference, a closed door meeting with only select members of the UN, a press briefing, showing video of the Arctic melting in the summer.
[02:49:10.435 --> 02:49:22.303]  That'd be like if I lived in Wisconsin and I went out and showed my house December 15th covered with snow and said, look, it was once cold.
[02:49:22.303 --> 02:49:28.027]  And then I show them July 4th, 2010 and say, look, now it's green grass.
[02:49:28.027 --> 02:49:29.107]  It's global warming.
[02:49:29.107 --> 02:49:29.388]  Yeah.
[02:49:29.388 --> 02:49:32.690]  Cause the earth's tilted towards the sun.
[02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:35.692]  We're orbiting a giant nuclear furnace.
[02:49:40.626 --> 02:49:43.407]  But Al Gore, three years ago, said it could be completely melted.
[02:49:43.407 --> 02:49:46.809]  It's actually gotten bigger.
[02:49:46.809 --> 02:49:48.150]  Bigger than it was three years ago.
[02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:53.052]  Because not only does it get bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer, there's cycles.
[02:49:53.052 --> 02:49:57.114]  And this has all been recorded by Arctic Expeditions.
[02:49:57.114 --> 02:49:59.476]  You know, one year an Arctic Explorer goes up,
[02:50:00.444 --> 02:50:04.307]  And then it gets cold and traps him 200 miles in!
[02:50:04.307 --> 02:50:10.733]  And they say, oh, the last expedition 10 years ago, this didn't happen, because it fluctuates!
[02:50:10.733 --> 02:50:23.444]  I mean, it's even more asinine to say that polar bears can't swim, but worse than that is to say that climate change is abnormal.
[02:50:23.444 --> 02:50:25.806]  Think how dumb they think you are.
[02:50:25.806 --> 02:50:26.987]  Climate change!
[02:50:30.009 --> 02:50:33.152]  Change.
[02:50:33.152 --> 02:50:37.216]  Climate change.
[02:50:37.216 --> 02:50:42.681]  There were times in British history where every year major rivers froze.
[02:50:42.681 --> 02:50:45.363]  Now it hasn't happened in a century.
[02:50:45.363 --> 02:50:48.926]  But there were times before that when it didn't freeze at all either.
[02:50:48.926 --> 02:50:51.128]  They have records of all of this.
[02:50:51.128 --> 02:50:52.470]  It fluctuates.
[02:50:54.059 --> 02:50:57.726]  But again, they tell your school kids that penguins can't swim in the ground.
[02:50:57.726 --> 02:50:59.209]  That's what you let them do.
[02:50:59.209 --> 02:51:01.333]  These criminals, they know what they're doing.
[02:51:02.403 --> 02:51:07.025]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:52:03.121 --> 02:52:07.148]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:07.148 --> 02:52:10.373]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.373 --> 02:52:11.796]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:12.498 --> 02:52:15.199]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.199 --> 02:52:21.562]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.562 --> 02:52:27.105]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:27.105 --> 02:52:36.729]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.869 --> 02:52:39.210]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.210 --> 02:52:40.791]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.791 --> 02:52:43.253]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.253 --> 02:52:45.374]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.374 --> 02:52:50.537]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:01.963 --> 02:53:03.984]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[02:53:04.628 --> 02:53:06.469]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:08.269]  Don't ignore your prostate health.

[02:53:43.593 --> 02:53:44.053]  Call 1-800-360-8306.

[02:53:48.354 --> 02:53:48.534]  Get up!
[02:53:48.534 --> 02:53:48.755]  Stand up!
[02:54:12.345 --> 02:54:22.808]  So, Al Gore came out again and said, look, five to seven years, there's not going to be any ice caps.
[02:54:40.171 --> 02:54:46.155]  And then the actual scientist that he quotes came out and said, well, that's not actually right.
[02:54:46.155 --> 02:54:52.319]  I'm saying it could potentially maybe happen, but certainly not a 75% chance like Al Gore says.
[02:54:52.319 --> 02:55:03.287]  I mean, these guys said we were going to all freeze to death in 1974 and that we had to build and pay global taxes to build giant carbon dioxide factories to terraform the earth.
[02:55:06.991 --> 02:55:14.433]  I mean, they just keep making up lie after lie, but notice every lie positions them as the saviors of the earth.
[02:55:14.433 --> 02:55:16.533]  They will save you.
[02:55:16.533 --> 02:55:21.674]  Just pay them the tax money.
[02:55:21.674 --> 02:55:34.097]  The good news is, we had a big guest on yesterday, who's a high-powered lawyer, works with Congress, and he did break the news here that he's already started litigation, but he didn't want to give details.
[02:55:35.555 --> 02:55:44.959]  And I don't know if this is that litigation, but there's a lot of litigation against these different universities and government bodies in the emails, openly engaged in fraud.
[02:55:44.959 --> 02:55:47.980]  The British have been caught destroying the evidence now.
[02:55:47.980 --> 02:55:55.663]  But they said, don't worry, we have the value-added, integrated data that we made up.
[02:55:55.663 --> 02:55:57.884]  They immediately destroyed the data.
[02:55:57.884 --> 02:56:01.065]  What does that tell you when somebody destroys the data when they get caught?
[02:56:03.168 --> 02:56:06.471]  It's like the police come in your house and you're like flushing cocaine down the toilet.
[02:56:06.471 --> 02:56:14.900]  I mean, it's... Or let's say you've been killing little kids, you're like throwing their body parts in a furnace as the cops come in, pouring gasoline on it.
[02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:18.824]  I mean, just caught red-handed.
[02:56:18.824 --> 02:56:21.747]  It's even worse trying to destroy the evidence.
[02:56:21.747 --> 02:56:25.431]  So now the Department of Energy's had to send a litigation hold notice
[02:56:26.809 --> 02:56:34.678]  Regarding CRU to employees asking to preserve documents saying do not shred documents.
[02:56:34.678 --> 02:56:39.104]  The Department of Energy has received a litigation hold notice from the U.S.
[02:56:39.104 --> 02:56:43.168]  Department of Energy General Counsel and the DOE Office of Inspector General.
[02:56:44.011 --> 02:56:51.693]  This is due to lawsuits being filed and congressional requests regarding the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England.
[02:56:51.693 --> 02:56:56.875]  Accordingly, they are requesting that SRNS's, SRR's, this is happening in the U.S.
[02:56:56.875 --> 02:57:12.299]  too, not just England, and other site contractors locate and preserve all documents, records, data, correspondence, notes, and other materials, whether official or unofficial, original or duplicative, drafts or final versions, partial or complete.
[02:57:14.046 --> 02:57:17.127]  Related to global warming.
[02:57:17.127 --> 02:57:28.232]  And this includes PDFs, PDAs, Palm Pilots, Blackberries, computers, telephone logs, internet usage files, emails, system manuals, network access information.
[02:57:28.232 --> 02:57:29.152]  It goes on and on.
[02:57:29.152 --> 02:57:38.575]  Folks, it looks like they're not going to get Copenhagen, but they're going to try to do it by stealth, as Lord Monten and others have said.
[02:57:38.575 --> 02:57:42.257]  I want to break that down when we come back, but this is better than we thought.
[02:57:43.390 --> 02:57:47.612]  Because if there's no tentative agreement, Obama has nothing to sign.
[02:57:47.612 --> 02:57:54.595]  So what they'll do is they're going to sign an agreement to agree to meet in Mexico City next year, like our expert guest said yesterday.
[02:57:54.595 --> 02:57:56.616]  And that's now come out today.
[02:57:56.616 --> 02:58:02.778]  And he is still going to instruct the EPA to say that carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[02:58:02.778 --> 02:58:05.960]  And they're going to go ahead and implement the tax.
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:07.180]  We've got to fight it.
[02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:09.681]  We've got to make the Senate and the House do their job.
[02:58:09.681 --> 02:58:10.942]  The states have to say no.
[02:58:12.409 --> 02:58:14.330]  If we'll just get up off our butts.
[02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:19.232]  I mean, if a bully comes over and starts punching us and we lay there, we know he's gonna win.
[02:58:19.232 --> 02:58:25.695]  But if we just attack the bully, if he's bigger than us in the Info War, pick up a rock, slam it upside their head.
[02:58:25.695 --> 02:58:27.236]  I mean that figuratively.
[02:58:27.236 --> 02:58:29.918]  I mean, you know, do whatever you got to.
[02:58:29.918 --> 02:58:31.658]  Pick up a stick.
[02:58:31.658 --> 02:58:32.879]  I mean, we got the Info War.
[02:58:32.879 --> 02:58:34.680]  Let's get nasty with these people.
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:35.480]  Let's take them on.
[02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:37.041]  Let's discredit these criminals.
[02:58:37.041 --> 02:58:40.543]  They're scumbag degenerate filth that will be defeated.
[02:58:40.543 --> 02:58:40.943]  Period.

[02:59:54.415 --> 02:59:56.817]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.817 --> 02:59:59.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.998 --> 03:00:08.999]  All right, here's the deal.
[03:00:08.999 --> 03:00:17.206]  I want to continue with phone calls, and then I want to get into internet censorship in the United States, Canada, England, Australia.
[03:00:17.206 --> 03:00:19.348]  The Western world is starting to outdo China.
[03:00:19.348 --> 03:00:21.610]  I mean, it's really happening.
[03:00:21.610 --> 03:00:23.111]  I want to get into some economic news.
[03:00:23.111 --> 03:00:25.073]  There's a bunch of stuff I haven't gotten to.
[03:00:25.073 --> 03:00:29.177]  I have some other video clips I want to play, but I want to continue taking your calls.
[03:00:33.138 --> 03:00:37.501]  Ash, Paul, Roger, Adam, Bern, Joe, and others.
[03:00:37.501 --> 03:00:40.083]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:40.083 --> 03:00:46.928]  But finishing up with ClimateGate, we do have the initiative.
[03:00:46.928 --> 03:00:48.589]  They are on the run.
[03:00:48.589 --> 03:00:52.492]  They've been caught in fraud over and over and over and over again.
[03:00:52.492 --> 03:00:56.855]  And they always just say, there's a consensus, no one disagrees.
[03:00:58.945 --> 03:00:59.865]  And just move on.
[03:00:59.865 --> 03:01:04.967]  But now, the fact that they're lying on purpose has been exposed.
[03:01:04.967 --> 03:01:08.008]  The Third World got the leaked text last week.
[03:01:08.008 --> 03:01:11.449]  I told you that was a big deal.
[03:01:11.449 --> 03:01:15.490]  I mean, it's like jumping in front of a train's a big deal.
[03:01:15.490 --> 03:01:17.510]  I mean, I'm not that smart.
[03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:19.851]  When they keep the treaty secret,
[03:01:21.107 --> 03:01:25.589]  They plan to keep it secret until Thursday so they can ram it through with Obama there.
[03:01:25.589 --> 03:01:28.070]  I mean, imagine how these governments operate.
[03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:30.651]  Oh, the treaty's secret.
[03:01:30.651 --> 03:01:31.852]  We can't let you see it.
[03:01:31.852 --> 03:01:40.056]  And then they leak it and it says the third world has to make right at double the cuts and it's meant to shut them off so the IMF and World Bank can take over and totally control them.
[03:01:40.056 --> 03:01:41.776]  Then we'll have a banking dictatorship.
[03:01:41.776 --> 03:01:43.117]  The UN will have no power.
[03:01:43.117 --> 03:01:44.297]  Private banks will rule the planet.
[03:01:45.678 --> 03:01:55.646]  I mean, it's just so openly certified corruption, certified tyranny.
[03:01:55.646 --> 03:02:01.511]  And of course the third world was suckered and told, oh yeah, you're going to get all of America's money.
[03:02:01.511 --> 03:02:04.533]  You're going to get all of Europe and Japan's money.
[03:02:04.533 --> 03:02:08.176]  Yes, the same IMF and World Bank that have always been robbing you blind.
[03:02:08.176 --> 03:02:14.842]  They're going to suddenly give you all this money because George Soros promises, because he's a nice man.
[03:02:17.682 --> 03:02:28.228]  And these gullible fools, all paid off by Soros and the UN, I guess they weren't fools, showed up thinking they were about to get a bunch of money and they were told, actually we're going to kill most of the people in your country.
[03:02:28.228 --> 03:02:43.477]  15 million starved to death every year, just our ethanol scam taking the food production for gasoline, that, that made 10 million more starved to death, this will be a hundred fold that, how's that sound?
[03:02:43.477 --> 03:02:44.258]  And the people were like,
[03:02:45.214 --> 03:02:48.979]  Even though you bought us off, you want to kill most our people?
[03:02:48.979 --> 03:02:49.761]  Yes, we do.
[03:02:49.761 --> 03:02:52.364]  And have a one-child policy.
[03:02:52.364 --> 03:02:53.466]  How does that sound?
[03:02:54.551 --> 03:02:58.874]  Well, gee, already most our people know you spike the vaccines and kill them!
[03:02:58.874 --> 03:03:01.796]  We're gonna get overthrown if we try this!
[03:03:01.796 --> 03:03:04.938]  And they literally, the Africans, were crying on TV over it.
[03:03:04.938 --> 03:03:12.944]  And our media would spin it and go, the Africans want America to make bigger cuts because America flooded the ocean and made Africa flood.
[03:03:12.944 --> 03:03:15.626]  I mean, literally, they're on the news saying Africa's flooding.
[03:03:15.626 --> 03:03:23.392]  I mean, it's just, the UN's own report says we've had the least amount of natural disasters per capita in the last decade than
[03:03:25.776 --> 03:03:27.217]  Well, where is that Reuters article?
[03:03:27.217 --> 03:03:28.037]  I've got it here in the stack.
[03:03:28.037 --> 03:03:29.138]  Let me give you the exact headline.
[03:03:29.138 --> 03:03:34.160]  I forget the exact number.
[03:03:34.160 --> 03:03:36.201]  It's big oil behind climate scan.
[03:03:36.201 --> 03:03:38.502]  Doesn't matter, I'll find it.
[03:03:38.502 --> 03:03:41.163]  Hey, you guys, I printed off that article about the UN.
[03:03:41.163 --> 03:03:45.785]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[03:03:45.785 --> 03:03:50.107]  About the UN says, the last decade's one of the least violent
[03:03:51.806 --> 03:03:52.766]  I'll find it in a minute.
[03:03:52.766 --> 03:03:56.248]  African states in climate talks boycott.
[03:03:56.248 --> 03:03:58.209]  Deadlock threatens Copenhagen climate deal.
[03:03:58.209 --> 03:03:59.890]  That's back today.
[03:03:59.890 --> 03:04:00.490]  Climate treaty.
[03:04:00.490 --> 03:04:03.912]  We create new global agencies to transfer money and technology from U.S.
[03:04:03.912 --> 03:04:05.572]  and other developed countries to third world.
[03:04:05.572 --> 03:04:07.253]  You mean to the IMF and World Bank.
[03:04:07.253 --> 03:04:07.633]  Gore.
[03:04:07.633 --> 03:04:10.415]  Polar ice may vanish.
[03:04:10.415 --> 03:04:10.855]  Here it is.
[03:04:10.855 --> 03:04:13.996]  Natural disasters at decade low.
[03:04:13.996 --> 03:04:14.456]  There you go.
[03:04:14.456 --> 03:04:18.638]  In 2009 UN report Reuters.
[03:04:18.638 --> 03:04:19.939]  So it's a decade low this year.
[03:04:22.788 --> 03:04:23.769]  And some of that other news.
[03:04:23.769 --> 03:04:29.414]  But the point here is, is that they are in big trouble.
[03:04:29.414 --> 03:04:30.575]  But they're not going to stop.
[03:04:30.575 --> 03:04:31.856]  These are criminals.
[03:04:31.856 --> 03:04:34.018]  They want to run your life.
[03:04:34.018 --> 03:04:37.781]  And they are brainwashing your kids, they run your local schools, they run everything.
[03:04:37.781 --> 03:04:43.125]  You've got to go to your city councils, go to your school boards and say, stop teaching this fraud.
[03:04:43.125 --> 03:04:45.848]  Stop teaching my kid your one-child policy.
[03:04:45.848 --> 03:04:47.089]  Stop your brainwashing.
[03:04:48.171 --> 03:04:50.073]  You degenerate control freaks!
[03:04:50.073 --> 03:04:52.596]  Get out of my life, you parasites!
[03:04:52.596 --> 03:05:01.345]  We're gonna come back, take a bunch of calls, get into the big push now, not just for government-run healthcare, which looks like it may pass, but for a bunch of new taxes!
[03:05:01.345 --> 03:05:05.889]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:05.889 --> 03:05:06.470]  Number one.
[03:05:06.770 --> 03:05:11.073]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:11.073 --> 03:05:15.957]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.957 --> 03:05:16.697]  It's true.
[03:05:16.697 --> 03:05:21.260]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:22.381 --> 03:05:25.985]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.985 --> 03:05:30.689]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:30.689 --> 03:05:33.452]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:33.452 --> 03:05:36.795]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:37.916 --> 03:05:42.059]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:42.059 --> 03:05:47.122]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:47.122 --> 03:05:51.284]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:51.284 --> 03:05:53.085]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[03:06:02.981 --> 03:06:06.942]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.942 --> 03:06:15.805]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:15.805 --> 03:06:20.426]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:20.426 --> 03:06:31.249]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.889 --> 03:06:41.391]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:41.391 --> 03:06:46.833]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:06:46.833 --> 03:06:54.314]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:54.314 --> 03:06:57.055]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:07:02.170 --> 03:07:05.831]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:05.831 --> 03:07:09.432]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:09.432 --> 03:07:14.213]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:07:14.213 --> 03:07:20.615]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:20.615 --> 03:07:22.856]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:07:23.396 --> 03:07:23.696]  Tim Geithner?
[03:07:23.696 --> 03:07:24.217]  Bernanke?
[03:07:24.217 --> 03:07:24.857]  They're arsonists!
[03:07:24.857 --> 03:07:25.538]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:25.538 --> 03:07:27.659]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:44.151]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:07:44.151 --> 03:07:49.574]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:07:49.574 --> 03:07:58.679]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:03.132 --> 03:08:09.756]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.756 --> 03:08:17.201]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.201 --> 03:08:31.690]  Alright, let's blast through your phone calls right now and I'm going to get into more of what's developing across our planet as we desperately fight the private global corporate takeover known as the New World Order.
[03:08:31.690 --> 03:08:31.770]  Oh!
[03:08:32.779 --> 03:08:37.804]  Before I do that, I am famous for saying I'm going to cover something and then not doing it.
[03:08:37.804 --> 03:08:44.111]  I know, because I move off to something else, but I said I would talk about Tiger Woods.
[03:08:44.111 --> 03:08:47.955]  So let me just talk about Tiger Woods right now.
[03:08:47.955 --> 03:08:53.921]  Two, three weeks ago, when he first had the wreck, everybody called me wanting me to talk about it.
[03:08:55.996 --> 03:09:03.002]  Why should I care if somebody at one o'clock in the morning has a wreck by their house and if their wife was attacking him?
[03:09:03.002 --> 03:09:07.766]  That's par for the course.
[03:09:07.766 --> 03:09:10.869]  I mean, welcome to decadent America.
[03:09:10.869 --> 03:09:14.272]  They're worth a billion bucks and they're not happy.
[03:09:14.272 --> 03:09:22.459]  And, you know, if it comes out that Tiger Woods is running giant child kidnapping rings with Dyncor and Halliburton, then I'll become concerned.
[03:09:27.443 --> 03:09:31.065]  I mean, yes, he liked racy women, and he liked a lot of them.
[03:09:31.065 --> 03:09:35.927]  And what he did, I'm sure, isn't good for his wife and children, and it's not good.
[03:09:35.927 --> 03:09:50.894]  But compared to Halliburton and DynCorp on congressional record running giant child kidnapping rings, on record, Chicago Tribune, Associated Press,
[03:09:54.551 --> 03:10:11.980]  Big UN groups caught in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in Central Europe, running giant sex slave rings, kidnapping children, using UN aircraft to fly them out all over the world.
[03:10:11.980 --> 03:10:14.501]  But see, no, we can't talk about that.
[03:10:14.501 --> 03:10:17.903]  We've got to talk about Tiger Woods with 30-year-old hookers.
[03:10:21.465 --> 03:10:27.190]  We can't talk about offshore banks that have stolen over 23 trillion dollars in the last year from us.
[03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:42.242]  We can't talk about how they're setting up a value-added tax and national federally administered sales tax to track everything we buy, sell, and do with new bureaucracies and new taxing authorities that'll make the IRS look like choir boys.
[03:10:42.242 --> 03:10:42.362]  No!
[03:10:43.635 --> 03:11:03.604]  We can't talk about what's really in the Copenhagen Treaty, open world government, or how Obama's declaring himself an emperor, a dictator, saying if Congress won't pass the sign over of power to the UN, he'll just implement it.
[03:11:03.604 --> 03:11:04.965]  We can't talk about how
[03:11:06.030 --> 03:11:23.642]  Rand Corporation's done a report calling for the new Homeland Security Divisions, the 379,000 troops, to augment all local police departments and that local police will form auxiliaries of the new National Police Force run by the Pentagon.
[03:11:23.642 --> 03:11:28.865]  I've read all 130-plus pages in the 50-something page addendum.
[03:11:28.865 --> 03:11:32.288]  I suggest you go read, let me get a close shot of this please, gentlemen,
[03:11:37.597 --> 03:11:40.579]  A stability police force for the United States.
[03:11:40.579 --> 03:11:43.321]  Justification and options for creating U.S.
[03:11:43.321 --> 03:11:44.541]  capabilities.
[03:11:44.541 --> 03:11:51.326]  I mean, this is a death squad manual.
[03:11:51.326 --> 03:11:57.370]  It's got the force setups for the federal police.
[03:11:57.370 --> 03:11:58.790]  And by the way, this has already been set up.
[03:11:58.790 --> 03:12:03.393]  They're just now announcing it.
[03:12:03.393 --> 03:12:05.795]  Here's a medium stability police force unit.
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:10.921]  Here's a small stability police force.
[03:12:10.921 --> 03:12:14.222]  This is the federal officer that's over your small town.
[03:12:14.222 --> 03:12:16.623]  You've got a small town of 500 people.
[03:12:16.623 --> 03:12:19.244]  Well, this is the group that's going to run your life.
[03:12:19.244 --> 03:12:21.144]  They're going to run carbon taxes.
[03:12:21.144 --> 03:12:23.885]  They got special forces operatives getting in place.
[03:12:23.885 --> 03:12:27.287]  In the paper in Austin, black ops run this.
[03:12:27.287 --> 03:12:33.309]  These people aren't going to, you are going to be slaves, folks, and they mean business.
[03:12:33.309 --> 03:12:33.949]  Here's another one.
[03:12:33.949 --> 03:12:35.730]  Medium stability police force.
[03:12:35.730 --> 03:12:36.350]  Ooh, look at that.
[03:12:37.503 --> 03:12:40.064]  This is for a bigger city.
[03:12:40.064 --> 03:12:50.368]  This is the federal police commander over your police department.
[03:12:50.368 --> 03:12:53.289]  Pentagon openly taking over your police departments.
[03:12:53.289 --> 03:12:55.971]  I mean, that is worse than Red China.
[03:12:55.971 --> 03:13:00.652]  Red China doesn't even allow that.
[03:13:00.652 --> 03:13:02.753]  What do you think they're being set up for?
[03:13:07.893 --> 03:13:09.034]  It happens everywhere.
[03:13:09.034 --> 03:13:20.524]  When this is set up, they're going to take your farms and ranches, they're going to take your children, they're going to take everything you've got, and they always do it by, well, you've got this environmental fee on your property, you can't pay it, Bob.
[03:13:20.524 --> 03:13:25.908]  And most people, alright, I'll give you the property, alright, alright.
[03:13:25.908 --> 03:13:30.032]  But if you hold up, they're just going to call up the police force and they're going to come by and murder your butt.
[03:13:30.819 --> 03:13:35.481]  You pay for the military, they're there to attack the enemy, and that enemy's you.
[03:13:35.481 --> 03:13:41.703]  You read the MIAC report, you read the Homeland Security report, I got those reports since the late 90s and nobody listened to me.
[03:13:41.703 --> 03:13:48.486]  Now when I cover them, they get national attention.
[03:13:48.486 --> 03:13:50.447]  Your military isn't your military.
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:53.361]  I've talked to so much family in the Army.
[03:13:53.361 --> 03:13:57.202]  I've got a lot of family in the Army, and I've talked to other people, and they're all mad.
[03:13:57.202 --> 03:14:05.766]  I mean, I know people that are in supply and logistics, and people that are in over-repair, and they've all been training for three years for riot control domestically.
[03:14:06.593 --> 03:14:26.541]  Long before they dropped the hammer on the banking situation, it's been reported by Bloomberg and Squibb's Howard News Service that it was all staged, all designed, and they're going to keep killing the economy, and they're going to stage riots, and you're going to beg to have the army on the streets, and they'll restore order, and then they'll never leave.
[03:14:26.541 --> 03:14:29.562]  And it'll just be, where'd Bob go?
[03:14:29.562 --> 03:14:31.563]  Bob wouldn't leave his house.
[03:14:31.563 --> 03:14:34.324]  They sent a robot in and killed him.
[03:14:34.324 --> 03:14:34.404]  Shh!
[03:14:36.377 --> 03:14:42.201]  And they'll be like a 12-year-old walking by with their armband, literally giving them armbands, with the Explorer Scouts now.
[03:14:42.201 --> 03:14:54.088]  They'll be like, that's already happening, adults are already... Just, oh man, the worst part is going to be the 12, 13, 14-year-old punks on power trips.
[03:14:54.088 --> 03:14:57.530]  I mean, it's going to be really hard getting bossed around by them.
[03:14:57.530 --> 03:14:59.151]  But that's what America is!
[03:14:59.151 --> 03:15:04.495]  We are the ultimate rotten cow being fed on by carrion.
[03:15:06.479 --> 03:15:08.261]  Being fed on by carrion turkeys.
[03:15:08.261 --> 03:15:12.545]  That's what they call the buzzards around here.
[03:15:12.545 --> 03:15:16.148]  Turkey buzzard.
[03:15:16.148 --> 03:15:18.490]  I just can't believe our country's this easy to rob.
[03:15:18.490 --> 03:15:23.114]  I mean, this is a completely criminal, illegal, unconstitutional operation.
[03:15:23.114 --> 03:15:27.839]  Has nothing to do with the stupid Al-Qaeda boogeyman you were all taught to fear.
[03:15:27.839 --> 03:15:31.182]  It's for you and your guns and your house by a bunch of criminals.
[03:15:37.298 --> 03:15:41.082]  We really are a nation of just cowards.
[03:15:41.082 --> 03:15:46.669]  The cops are gonna go along, the military's gonna go along, the general public's gonna go along.
[03:15:46.669 --> 03:15:50.333]  Obama will get a bunch of it set up, then a Republican will come in, he'll continue it.
[03:15:50.333 --> 03:15:52.876]  Suddenly Republicans will love the police state.
[03:15:52.876 --> 03:15:56.199]  Democrats didn't like war, now they love it.
[03:15:56.199 --> 03:15:58.202]  War is peace, oh give him a peace prize.
[03:16:06.673 --> 03:16:10.734]  We have to admit how pathetic we are.
[03:16:10.734 --> 03:16:24.137]  You know, every few years I get to piggin' out and drinkin' whiskey and smokin' cigarettes and I've gotta finally admit to myself, after a month or two of it, when I gained 20 pounds doin' it, that this may feel good, buddy, but you gotta stop it.
[03:16:24.137 --> 03:16:28.718]  You can't go eat big ribeye steaks and drink a bottle of whiskey.
[03:16:28.718 --> 03:16:32.319]  The point is, and I've gotta realize it's bad and not do it.
[03:16:32.319 --> 03:16:34.640]  And I fall back sometimes, but I quit.
[03:16:35.993 --> 03:16:40.075]  I've gone five, six years before without drinking or smoking or eating like a pig.
[03:16:40.075 --> 03:16:43.776]  But the point is, is that when I start working too much, it's a crutch I fall back on.
[03:16:43.776 --> 03:16:45.997]  It's a big anxiety relief.
[03:16:45.997 --> 03:16:53.861]  You can be worried about the world and worried about what you're doing and go in and drink a couple beers and eat a big steak, you're not worried about it anymore.
[03:16:55.259 --> 03:16:56.840]  I'm pretty pathetic.
[03:16:56.840 --> 03:16:59.961]  And when I start getting pathetic, I've got to admit I'm pathetic.
[03:16:59.961 --> 03:17:02.061]  You as a country have to do that too, folks.
[03:17:02.061 --> 03:17:06.923]  I mean, we have to admit we are a steaming pile of horse poo.
[03:17:06.923 --> 03:17:10.324]  I mean, we really are a joke.
[03:17:10.324 --> 03:17:11.724]  By the way, I've been corrected.
[03:17:11.724 --> 03:17:13.885]  For a decade, I've been saying 50 million abortions.
[03:17:13.885 --> 03:17:15.946]  Of course, it's 60 million now.
[03:17:15.946 --> 03:17:22.888]  When you pull up number of abortions in U.S., latest numbers, I think it's 60 mil, but I want to be precise about that.
[03:17:24.454 --> 03:17:33.676]  I mean, look, if we're so lazy that we kill our own babies... I mean, even if you're for birth control, don't be lazy.
[03:17:33.676 --> 03:17:35.016]  Get regular birth control.
[03:17:35.016 --> 03:17:49.259]  Don't go in and have dangerous procedures for yourself and kill a kid because you were too lazy and now you don't want to raise the kid because television told you kids are horrible when you're not living till you got children.
[03:17:49.259 --> 03:17:53.520]  Heaven sounds like living on some deserted jungle tropical island with like 50 children.
[03:17:57.469 --> 03:18:05.732]  Let me tell you, all you stupid yuppies and all you people that never had kids, you think you're all selfish and your life's all about you, you're not happy.
[03:18:05.732 --> 03:18:09.814]  Or you may think you're happy, you don't know how good it is having children.
[03:18:09.814 --> 03:18:19.138]  You don't know how magic they are and how much you understand about humanity once you have them.
[03:18:19.138 --> 03:18:25.721]  And sure, in modern society, they're a pain in the butt, and they get programmed by the society to act up,
[03:18:27.694 --> 03:18:28.854]  And they're rebellious.
[03:18:28.854 --> 03:18:31.055]  They're little people.
[03:18:31.055 --> 03:18:32.276]  But that's part of life.
[03:18:32.276 --> 03:18:38.038]  You're meant to be part of the life cycle.
[03:18:38.038 --> 03:18:42.300]  It's like you see butterflies mating.
[03:18:42.300 --> 03:18:46.802]  I mean, you're meant to live on this planet, hurtling through space.
[03:18:46.802 --> 03:18:47.982]  You're meant to have children.
[03:18:47.982 --> 03:18:52.724]  You're meant to love and struggle and have a life.
[03:18:52.724 --> 03:18:57.166]  And you've been taught that death is good and life is bad.
[03:19:00.600 --> 03:19:11.286]  And so now they think you're so weak-minded, so shallow, so open to suggestion, that they can write articles in Newsweek and Time Magazine saying, let's just kill old people.
[03:19:11.286 --> 03:19:14.608]  Hey, yuppies, you'll have more money if we start whacking grandma.
[03:19:14.608 --> 03:19:17.470]  And the yuppies are like, hell yeah, kill old people.
[03:19:17.470 --> 03:19:19.451]  Their life's not worth anything.
[03:19:19.451 --> 03:19:24.854]  The bioethics board said so, and then pretty soon it's, hey, let's just kill this kid, they're a little bit handicapped.
[03:19:24.854 --> 03:19:25.835]  Hey, let's have a law.
[03:19:29.124 --> 03:19:37.908]  That if a kid's got any genetic problems, or the government says they've got a genetic problem, too aggressive, that you can't have kids.
[03:19:37.908 --> 03:19:42.331]  Eh, let's go ahead and have Chinese-style net censorship in Australia and the U.S.
[03:19:42.331 --> 03:19:44.232]  Both governments now proposing it.
[03:19:44.232 --> 03:19:46.753]  Australia's going ahead with it.
[03:19:46.753 --> 03:19:49.014]  Eh, what's wrong with having secret prisons?
[03:19:49.014 --> 03:19:52.176]  Hell, what's wrong with torture?
[03:19:52.176 --> 03:19:57.438]  Now that Hitler guy, he was bad when he did it, but when we do it, man, it's gonna be mom and apple pie.
[03:19:57.438 --> 03:19:58.759]  It's gonna be really great.
[03:20:00.146 --> 03:20:00.536]  Okay.
[03:20:02.179 --> 03:20:05.701]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:20:05.701 --> 03:20:07.702]  Now, going green can save money.
[03:20:07.702 --> 03:20:13.265]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[03:20:13.265 --> 03:20:21.290]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:31.416]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing
[03:20:31.476 --> 03:20:32.196]  I think so.
[03:21:01.889 --> 03:21:08.557]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:21:08.557 --> 03:21:16.686]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:21:16.686 --> 03:21:22.272]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[03:21:22.592 --> 03:21:24.835]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[03:21:24.835 --> 03:21:29.942]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:21:29.942 --> 03:21:35.170]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:21:35.170 --> 03:21:38.875]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:21:39.495 --> 03:21:40.576]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:40.576 --> 03:21:45.080]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:49.984]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:21:49.984 --> 03:21:52.986]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:21:52.986 --> 03:21:54.768]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:54.768 --> 03:21:54.988]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.483 --> 03:22:06.532]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.532 --> 03:22:09.779]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:09.779 --> 03:22:11.181]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:22:11.883 --> 03:22:14.586]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.586 --> 03:22:20.952]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:20.952 --> 03:22:26.137]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.137 --> 03:22:36.146]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.246 --> 03:22:38.587]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.587 --> 03:22:40.168]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.168 --> 03:22:42.629]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.629 --> 03:22:44.770]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.770 --> 03:22:49.912]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:49.912 --> 03:22:54.914]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:54.914 --> 03:22:59.015]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:01.445 --> 03:23:02.106]  Attention!
[03:23:02.106 --> 03:23:17.485]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:23:17.485 --> 03:23:18.907]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silica
[03:23:20.529 --> 03:23:20.969]  I think so.
[03:23:43.968 --> 03:23:44.288]  I think so.
[03:24:13.126 --> 03:24:19.707]  Okay, let's rush through some calls, and then I do want to get into a whole area of news we haven't covered yet.
[03:24:19.707 --> 03:24:22.568]  Ash in Texas, thanks for holding.
[03:24:22.568 --> 03:24:23.888]  Go ahead.
[03:24:23.888 --> 03:24:25.448]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:24:25.448 --> 03:24:26.648]  Good.
[03:24:26.648 --> 03:24:28.249]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[03:24:28.249 --> 03:24:29.909]  Appreciate everything you're doing.
[03:24:29.909 --> 03:24:42.451]  I'm up here in Dallas, and you know these chemtrails up here, I don't know what it's like in Austin, but I'm sure it's the same, it's just unbelievable daily, how they're just dosing us with Tic-Tac-Toe boards every day in Dallas.
[03:24:44.046 --> 03:24:45.727]  I mean, is that the same thing down in Austin?
[03:24:45.727 --> 03:25:02.356]  Yeah, all the chemtrail deniers really have a problem, because our scientists came out for decades, since it started in the mid-90s, and said, this is barium salts aluminum dioxide, it appears to be a weather modification program, but it also has toxic effects on all life, especially mammals.
[03:25:03.618 --> 03:25:17.727]  And then John P. Holdren came out and said, headline, in his first press conference, first thing he talked about was, we've been secretly terraforming the Earth to save you from global warming, and we're now going to go from a test, which is giant,
[03:25:20.018 --> 03:25:23.841]  You know, it's like the Death Star blowing up Alderaan was just a test.
[03:25:23.841 --> 03:25:26.824]  I keep going back to Star Wars analogies, they never end.
[03:25:26.824 --> 03:25:28.745]  It's like Chuck Norris facts.
[03:25:28.745 --> 03:25:31.788]  I mean, can you imagine what the non-test is?
[03:25:31.788 --> 03:25:33.329]  In fact, people won't believe that.
[03:25:33.329 --> 03:25:41.155]  Google, John P. Holdren, geoengineering, calls for geoengineering.
[03:25:41.155 --> 03:25:42.797]  He gave an AP press conference.
[03:25:43.482 --> 03:25:45.864]  NAP headquarters in DC.
[03:25:45.864 --> 03:25:54.229]  And so yes, we have sent out researchers, we have shot chemtrail info, we are incorporating that into the next film.
[03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:57.311]  It's just there's so much, they've now declassified it!
[03:25:58.899 --> 03:26:05.480]  But it's kind of like they declassify global government, admit they're setting it up, but still the public doesn't know it exists.
[03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:07.701]  I don't know how to explain that.
[03:26:07.701 --> 03:26:15.542]  It's like telling children Santa Claus exists, they believe it, but then you tell them that a Mack truck in the highway may kill them, they don't believe it.
[03:26:15.542 --> 03:26:27.405]  It's like the general public believes in fairy tales that polar bears can't swim and that the sun doesn't heat the earth, but then they'll believe baloney, but they won't believe the truth.
[03:26:28.404 --> 03:26:29.204]  Yeah.
[03:26:29.204 --> 03:26:33.145]  The other day, Alex, they were spraying heavy duty and I called the Sheriff's Department.
[03:26:33.145 --> 03:26:35.766]  I'm sitting here looking at chemtrails right now in Dallas.
[03:26:35.766 --> 03:26:39.567]  But I called the Sheriff's Department and asked them, you know, what is this?
[03:26:39.567 --> 03:26:41.027]  And they looked at me and said, well, it's contrails.
[03:26:41.027 --> 03:26:41.727]  I said, no, it's not.
[03:26:41.727 --> 03:26:42.247]  I said, look at it.
[03:26:42.247 --> 03:26:43.788]  It's a tic-tac-toe board.
[03:26:43.788 --> 03:26:46.128]  He looked at it for a minute and he said, you know, you're right.
[03:26:46.128 --> 03:26:48.989]  He said, we don't have any jurisdiction over that.
[03:26:48.989 --> 03:26:50.549]  He said, but you need to call the FAA.
[03:26:50.549 --> 03:26:53.270]  So I called the FAA yesterday.
[03:26:53.270 --> 03:26:56.611]  Called them both in San Antonio and over here in Fort Worth.
[03:26:56.611 --> 03:26:58.011]  I recorded the conversations.
[03:26:59.006 --> 03:27:03.792]  And they first tried to tell me it was just contrails, I didn't know what I was talking about.
[03:27:03.792 --> 03:27:07.596]  Then, but they didn't realize I'd been listening to you for a couple years.
[03:27:07.596 --> 03:27:09.999]  So I hit them with what they're pouring out up there on us.
[03:27:10.815 --> 03:27:21.358]  And I told him that it's probably all tied to HAARP, which a lot of investigators believe it probably is, to where they can send electromagnetic waves through this.
[03:27:21.358 --> 03:27:24.219]  By the way, there's more than one array.
[03:27:24.219 --> 03:27:30.040]  They've got six in Europe, a couple in Russia, some in China, and several in the US and Canada.
[03:27:30.040 --> 03:27:32.041]  That Alaskan facility is not the only one.
[03:27:32.824 --> 03:27:42.451]  Well, you know, when I was in Spain this last summer, Alex, down in Andalusia, down there in the southern Spain, here comes a plane, way up there about 40,000 feet, spewing chemtrails.
[03:27:42.451 --> 03:27:53.039]  I mean, it's not a... You know, there's a big difference between a contrail like when you and I... No, a condensation trail we all grew up watching, stays there for a few seconds or a few minutes, it forms high up.
[03:27:53.039 --> 03:28:00.705]  Now, they're low, they stay all day, they turn into cloud banks, and then lo and behold, they just pulled up CBS News,
[03:28:01.405 --> 03:28:12.630]  They have this high altitude aerial spraying campaign where they admit, they're quote, folks, we have a global government that does whatever it wants in secret with unlimited funds.
[03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:15.391]  Heaven only knows what these nuts are up to.
[03:28:15.391 --> 03:28:16.972]  I mean, do you understand?
[03:28:17.950 --> 03:28:19.631]  Yeah, I mean, I totally agree with you there.
[03:28:19.631 --> 03:28:23.052]  One other thing I want to say, because I've waited a little while to talk to you, and I've been dying to talk to you.
[03:28:23.052 --> 03:28:24.992]  No, no, we won't be able to get to other people if we don't.
[03:28:24.992 --> 03:28:25.892]  See how that works.
[03:28:25.892 --> 03:28:26.893]  But that's how it works.
[03:28:26.893 --> 03:28:29.613]  That's why you hailed us, because I do give people time.
[03:28:29.613 --> 03:28:31.074]  Go ahead.
[03:28:31.074 --> 03:28:34.515]  On 9-11, one other thing, they're going to have this fake trial in New York.
[03:28:34.515 --> 03:28:38.536]  The info I have from their investigations, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is dead.
[03:28:38.536 --> 03:28:40.657]  Is that true?
[03:28:42.182 --> 03:28:42.902]  Well, no.
[03:28:42.902 --> 03:28:50.005]  They said they bombed and killed him 16 times, as the article Paul Watson wrote last year.
[03:28:50.005 --> 03:28:55.428]  So they claim they killed him a bunch before... Because they practice lies.
[03:28:55.428 --> 03:28:57.689]  They set the precedent to say ridiculous things.
[03:28:57.689 --> 03:29:02.391]  Like they've killed the number three in Al-Qaeda more than 20 times now.
[03:29:02.391 --> 03:29:04.412]  And then they captured him.
[03:29:04.412 --> 03:29:06.813]  They admit they tortured his children, threatened his family.
[03:29:08.334 --> 03:29:12.862]  And he confessed to bombing buildings that didn't exist for four years after he was incarcerated.
[03:29:12.862 --> 03:29:16.969]  And it's just all a complete joke.
[03:29:16.969 --> 03:29:20.134]  It's like they said they killed Chemical Ali five times.
[03:29:21.018 --> 03:29:21.558]  Well, sir, who knows?
[03:29:21.558 --> 03:29:22.738]  That's my whole point.
[03:29:42.563 --> 03:29:46.407]  There's a giant secret program spraying deadly chemicals on us.
[03:29:46.407 --> 03:29:48.829]  They now admit they're doing it and no one cares.
[03:29:48.829 --> 03:29:50.191]  Hooray Cowboys!
[03:29:50.191 --> 03:29:52.213]  I love Alzheimer's!
[03:29:52.213 --> 03:29:53.614]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.614 --> 03:29:56.137]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.137 --> 03:29:58.839]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.213 --> 03:30:05.236]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:05.236 --> 03:30:10.561]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.561 --> 03:30:12.603]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.603 --> 03:30:17.608]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.608 --> 03:30:18.529]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.789 --> 03:30:19.910]  When do you want it?
[03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:21.791]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.791 --> 03:30:22.871]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.871 --> 03:30:25.072]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:25.072 --> 03:30:26.413]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.413 --> 03:30:27.934]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.934 --> 03:30:33.196]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:33.196 --> 03:30:36.778]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.778 --> 03:30:40.260]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.600 --> 03:30:41.821]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.821 --> 03:30:42.742]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.742 --> 03:30:43.843]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.843 --> 03:30:44.764]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.764 --> 03:30:45.865]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.865 --> 03:30:48.909]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:48.909 --> 03:30:50.690]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:50.690 --> 03:30:51.611]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.

[03:31:08.187 --> 03:31:09.468]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:31:09.468 --> 03:31:10.288]  It's very real.
[03:31:10.288 --> 03:31:12.530]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:31:12.530 --> 03:31:14.172]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:32:00.979 --> 03:32:06.285]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:32:06.285 --> 03:32:10.830]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:32:10.830 --> 03:32:13.093]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:32:13.093 --> 03:32:14.715]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:32:14.715 --> 03:32:15.756]  There is a solution.

[03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:11.352]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:11.352 --> 03:33:17.034]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:17.034 --> 03:33:22.755]  I told you last week to tune in this week to be that big guest.
[03:33:22.755 --> 03:33:28.277]  It doesn't stop with Chuck Norris.
[03:33:28.277 --> 03:33:30.677]  Just gonna leave it at that.
[03:33:30.677 --> 03:33:32.538]  We got other really informative
[03:33:33.965 --> 03:33:41.530]  Groundbreaking, first-time visiting guest later in the week.
[03:33:41.530 --> 03:33:46.353]  Including Wanda Mara at 11.30, 30 minutes into the show.
[03:33:46.353 --> 03:33:50.396]  11.30 central.
[03:33:50.396 --> 03:33:52.517]  So I'm certainly excited about that.
[03:33:52.517 --> 03:34:01.644]  Not quite as excited I am about the Luby's cafeteria food they just brought in.
[03:34:01.644 --> 03:34:02.664]  I'm in a hokey mood today.
[03:34:05.424 --> 03:34:09.906]  Quite a carbon footprint, though, with that evil steak.
[03:34:09.906 --> 03:34:16.149]  Nothing like a cafeteria chop steak for you, huh?
[03:34:16.149 --> 03:34:18.690]  Yeah, Craig just gave a eugenics quote.
[03:34:18.690 --> 03:34:22.112]  He said, if we kill off all the grannies, we can get through Luby's quicker.
[03:34:22.112 --> 03:34:30.676]  No, Luby's wouldn't have that niche market of grannies, and so those of us that like granny food won't be able to get it occasionally, twice a year when we want it.
[03:34:32.295 --> 03:34:33.556]  You see, that's what the eugenicists think.
[03:34:33.556 --> 03:34:38.339]  They think if they wipe out certain ecosystems of human activity, that that will leave more for them.
[03:34:38.339 --> 03:34:41.581]  It actually creates less.
[03:34:41.581 --> 03:34:47.584]  We need 50 billion people to export giant space cities, deep space.
[03:34:47.584 --> 03:34:53.408]  Oh my God, the vision of humanity, if we would just widen it, it's just unstoppable!
[03:34:53.408 --> 03:35:00.432]  Where is the race consciousness of humanity itself to people, the stars, that pioneering spirit?
[03:35:00.432 --> 03:35:01.713]  If you took transplants,
[03:35:03.456 --> 03:35:19.223]  From the 17 and 1800s from the United States and train them and brought them up today, we would already be on distant Pluto with giant star cruisers on their way to the nearest habitable planets.
[03:35:19.223 --> 03:35:19.783]  Guaranteed!
[03:35:21.018 --> 03:35:22.999]  Now, the globalists have already sent their probes out.
[03:35:22.999 --> 03:35:25.480]  They've got a lot of suppressed secret technology.
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:27.801]  They have that spirit, but it's twisted.
[03:35:27.801 --> 03:35:46.290]  They want us to forget about the real technology, forget about real issues, forget about the wonderment of the universe around us, and walk into gas stations with our hair sticking up and grab a case and sit there with the guy behind the counter and go, I hope the cowboys do it again today.
[03:35:46.290 --> 03:35:47.950]  They ain't been doing too good.
[03:35:47.950 --> 03:35:48.951]  I was sitting there in a line,
[03:35:50.265 --> 03:35:51.965]  I'm trying to get my wife and I some coffee.
[03:35:51.965 --> 03:35:54.126]  She's out in the car with the kids.
[03:35:54.126 --> 03:36:01.268]  As five adult men in front of me at this little gas station in our neighborhood.
[03:36:01.268 --> 03:36:02.868]  And they didn't care about the cowboys.
[03:36:02.868 --> 03:36:04.768]  The guy behind the counter didn't care.
[03:36:04.768 --> 03:36:06.869]  It was just what men do.
[03:36:06.869 --> 03:36:09.029]  And they'd walk up and put their beer down.
[03:36:09.029 --> 03:36:11.210]  That's what's manly.
[03:36:11.210 --> 03:36:16.051]  And they'd sit back and talk about the cowboys with the people.
[03:36:17.577 --> 03:36:22.981]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you like the Cowboys, but give me a break!
[03:36:22.981 --> 03:36:26.043]  The country's overrun with criminals!
[03:36:26.043 --> 03:36:32.088]  Men should be feverishly running around at city council and warning their neighbors and acting like men and saying, we've got to do something!
[03:36:32.088 --> 03:36:32.829]  We've got to rally!
[03:36:32.829 --> 03:36:34.150]  We've got to warn the people!
[03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:36.792]  You should be doing what I do!
[03:36:36.792 --> 03:36:38.633]  I'm actually normal!
[03:36:38.633 --> 03:36:39.694]  You are abnormal!
[03:36:42.856 --> 03:36:45.958]  And I'd walk, and I'd watch the guy behind the counter.
[03:36:45.958 --> 03:36:53.763]  He was totally bored up, but he understands it's like the greeting, the pleasantry, is, yes, cowboys!
[03:36:53.763 --> 03:36:54.964]  He was a foreigner.
[03:36:54.964 --> 03:36:56.305]  Mm-hmm, cowboys, mm!
[03:36:56.305 --> 03:37:00.148]  And they would all have a cowboy discussion.
[03:37:00.148 --> 03:37:02.029]  By the way, did the Cowboys win Sunday?
[03:37:02.029 --> 03:37:05.911]  I mean, this is what really matters.
[03:37:05.911 --> 03:37:06.592]  You don't think so.
[03:37:09.299 --> 03:37:11.641]  I think I'm going to throw up.
[03:37:11.641 --> 03:37:12.402]  I mean, I really do.
[03:37:12.402 --> 03:37:15.684]  I mean, I just get me out of here.
[03:37:15.684 --> 03:37:24.010]  You have a scientific dictatorship on record poisoning your water supply and saying they're doing it to brain damage you and sterilize you.
[03:37:24.010 --> 03:37:29.934]  They're openly been caught putting cancer viruses on the vaccines on purpose to sterilize you.
[03:37:29.934 --> 03:37:33.137]  They are spraying you with aluminum dioxide on purpose.
[03:37:33.137 --> 03:37:36.920]  And all you care about is the Cowboys.
[03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:37.320]  They lost.
[03:37:39.278 --> 03:37:40.899]  To San Diego.
[03:37:40.899 --> 03:37:41.920]  That's the Chargers?
[03:37:41.920 --> 03:37:50.446]  I can show off that I know these things?
[03:37:50.446 --> 03:37:58.112]  It's just... I can't believe it.
[03:37:58.112 --> 03:38:01.435]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:38:01.435 --> 03:38:04.137]  I can't spend ten minutes with the next caller, but I do want to hear from everybody.
[03:38:04.137 --> 03:38:05.918]  Paul in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:38:05.918 --> 03:38:07.699]  Hi there.
[03:38:09.301 --> 03:38:13.063]  Hey, just to be quick, just a couple points.
[03:38:13.063 --> 03:38:20.147]  I have a long time friend, he has a girlfriend who has an immediate family member in the RCMP and the guy's probably like 20, 21 years old.
[03:38:20.147 --> 03:38:27.511]  And, you know, when he's in training, he'll tell my friend, oh, I just can't wait to get in there and rough people up and, you know, spy on people and stuff like that.
[03:38:27.511 --> 03:38:29.712]  And they love him in there.
[03:38:29.712 --> 03:38:32.954]  They let him go on and get his own car within the first couple weeks or month.
[03:38:33.792 --> 03:38:43.400]  And this is really the mentality of the people here in Canada that are signing up, you know, and it's pretty scary to see these little, basically, Nazis running around, you know?
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:52.929]  I don't know if you want to comment, I just had a couple other people... No, no, real men would be embarrassed of talking and acting like that.
[03:38:52.929 --> 03:39:01.236]  And no, I mean, they look for unstable video game players who were failed jocks
[03:39:02.523 --> 03:39:10.926]  Who weren't really popular, but wanted to be, and who were bullies, who finally got stood up to.
[03:39:10.926 --> 03:39:16.249]  And they say, I'm getting a badge and gun, then nobody can stand up against me.
[03:39:16.249 --> 03:39:19.350]  And I know there are good police out there.
[03:39:19.350 --> 03:39:26.313]  They send us information and they don't like the bad cops, but the system wants the bad cops.
[03:39:26.313 --> 03:39:28.934]  Let me tell you, I was in Canada, got off the airplane,
[03:39:30.219 --> 03:39:35.881]  They said, the guy had a French accent, he said, come with me, Mr. Jones.
[03:39:35.881 --> 03:39:41.083]  And they just relished laughing at me and screaming at me.
[03:39:41.083 --> 03:39:52.627]  I thought, man, I couldn't imagine being such a coward and such a petty person that I would enjoy exercising power over people all day for no reason.
[03:39:54.056 --> 03:39:59.120]  I mean, I'm really an aggressive person, and I have to hold back in not being aggressive with people.
[03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:03.144]  But no, these people... And it's embarrassing when I have to exercise power.
[03:40:03.144 --> 03:40:04.224]  I don't like it.
[03:40:04.224 --> 03:40:08.248]  I have a natural governor there.
[03:40:08.248 --> 03:40:16.114]  And so, yeah, no, it's... They're there to bang our heads and squeeze us and let us know.
[03:40:16.114 --> 03:40:19.177]  I mean, the Royal Mountain Police have been caught repeatedly.
[03:40:20.345 --> 03:40:26.869]  In mainstream news, just like I just said, you could pull up CBS News with them admitting they're chemtrailing us, so they pulled it up.
[03:40:26.869 --> 03:40:30.231]  You can pull up Toronto Star, you name it.
[03:40:30.231 --> 03:40:34.233]  Royal Mounted Police, let me just think of the exact headline of one of them.
[03:40:34.233 --> 03:40:42.538]  Royal Mounted Police admit staging event with officers.
[03:40:42.538 --> 03:40:46.941]  Royal Mounted Police admit their officers involved in scuffle.
[03:40:46.941 --> 03:40:48.622]  And they just have them attack their own cops.
[03:40:49.650 --> 03:40:52.714]  And then they step aside, and the criminal police know it's staged.
[03:40:52.714 --> 03:40:55.938]  They just want to attack the families that are out there protesting.
[03:40:55.938 --> 03:41:02.025]  And so they have a fake fight, and they go, all right, we framed them, we're terrorists, let's attack free speech now.
[03:41:02.025 --> 03:41:07.431]  And they just, it seems the weaker the person, the more they love beating women, old ladies.
[03:41:08.272 --> 03:41:19.526]  Uh, Portland, Oregon, repeatedly, they love to go out to rallies and attack babies in baby carriages, and then scream, you bleepin' bleeper, you shouldn't bring a baby to a, to a, a vent.
[03:41:19.526 --> 03:41:26.133]  Like, they'll, they'll spray your kid with the gas, and then they'll billy club you for it, makin' them spray the kid.
[03:41:26.133 --> 03:41:27.975]  And hey, don't worry.
[03:41:28.979 --> 03:41:32.423]  There it is, Canadian police caught attempting to stage riots.
[03:41:32.423 --> 03:41:40.952]  That was the original Prison Planet, but see if there's a link, because of course we reported it, local activists exposed it, we reported it, then the police admitted it.
[03:41:40.952 --> 03:41:42.234]  Click on there and see.
[03:41:42.234 --> 03:41:47.439]  And so it takes a special kind of person to go out and stage events so you can attack
[03:41:48.291 --> 03:41:50.671]  Basically, I just wanted to shed some light.
[03:41:50.671 --> 03:41:52.672]  Do you know who Mark Emery is?
[03:41:52.672 --> 03:41:53.692]  Basically, he's from Vancouver, Canada.
[03:42:14.281 --> 03:42:20.165]  He runs a marijuana seed operation, basically, and he would sell seeds.
[03:42:20.165 --> 03:42:21.446]  Canadian government was totally fine.
[03:42:21.446 --> 03:42:23.187]  They took his tax money, no problem.
[03:42:23.187 --> 03:42:24.688]  He was sending seeds to the U.S.
[03:42:24.688 --> 03:42:26.329]  That was the biggest market.
[03:42:26.329 --> 03:42:30.112]  The DEA raided him in 2005.
[03:42:30.112 --> 03:42:32.994]  They're now on a big thing to actually write him to the states right now.
[03:42:32.994 --> 03:42:33.754]  He was in remand.
[03:42:33.754 --> 03:42:35.035]  Yes, yes, I do.
[03:42:35.035 --> 03:42:36.336]  Paul, I appreciate your call.
[03:42:36.336 --> 03:42:37.157]  I am aware of how...
[03:42:39.264 --> 03:42:47.732]  They couldn't shut down marijuana, and it was its own underground industry, and the globalists want the money and the power, and they want you using their illegal drugs.
[03:42:47.732 --> 03:42:54.299]  You know, the drugs they control in certain regions, opiates and cocaine, and then their Prozac and other stuff they make.
[03:42:54.299 --> 03:42:56.080]  The Ritalin.
[03:42:56.080 --> 03:43:02.286]  And so they tricked everybody in 14 states and said, oh, we're going to decriminalize, set up your dispensaries, and now they're saying, yeah,
[03:43:03.322 --> 03:43:07.003]  We're gonna let you have, you know, one dispensary for every 20 square miles now.
[03:43:07.003 --> 03:43:11.165]  So, they're using regulation as a way to shutting it down.
[03:43:11.165 --> 03:43:15.326]  Just like they're using regulation to shut down the Second Amendment outside the law.
[03:43:15.326 --> 03:43:16.306]  And hey, good for them.
[03:43:16.306 --> 03:43:17.287]  Hey, good for the cops.
[03:43:17.287 --> 03:43:23.089]  Hey, take your vaccines, drink plenty of fluoride.
[03:43:23.089 --> 03:43:26.310]  I morally would say, though, don't give it to your kids.
[03:43:26.310 --> 03:43:29.071]  Well, you know, maybe that's a blessing for you to give it to your kids.
[03:43:29.071 --> 03:43:29.871]  Maybe that's what you want.
[03:43:31.095 --> 03:43:32.517]  I mean, okay, hey, you got power.
[03:43:32.517 --> 03:43:37.283]  Hey, don't let me get in the way of all your fun, what you're helping conjure up right now.
[03:43:37.283 --> 03:43:39.546]  You want this, you got it.
[03:43:39.546 --> 03:43:42.930]  Anything you want, you got it.
[03:43:42.930 --> 03:43:45.493]  Anything you need, you got it.
[03:43:45.493 --> 03:43:45.633]  Oh, baby.
[03:43:48.684 --> 03:43:53.387]  Every time I think about you, oh my sweetie pie.
[03:43:53.387 --> 03:43:59.051]  Your black ski mask, your camera, your prison cams.
[03:43:59.051 --> 03:44:03.254]  You're so tough when you beat a young lady in the head.
[03:44:03.254 --> 03:44:06.976]  Or release a police dog on an old woman.
[03:44:06.976 --> 03:44:10.038]  Anything you want, you got it.
[03:44:10.038 --> 03:44:14.281]  You're criminal thugs for offshore bankers, baby.
[03:44:16.834 --> 03:44:23.458]  That's some bad singing on purpose there.
[03:44:23.458 --> 03:44:25.339]  Every time I think about it, I'm bored.
[03:44:25.339 --> 03:44:29.862]  Old women come out with bags out of a store and there's police going, no one on the streets of Pittsburgh!
[03:44:29.862 --> 03:44:31.923]  And you're like, officer, I'm just shopping.
[03:44:31.923 --> 03:44:33.324]  Shut up!
[03:44:33.324 --> 03:44:33.985]  Wham!
[03:44:33.985 --> 03:44:35.606]  Police dog!
[03:44:35.606 --> 03:44:36.666]  God, I hate America!
[03:44:39.653 --> 03:44:42.695]  I mean, these are literal pit demons they're releasing on us.
[03:44:42.695 --> 03:44:46.797]  And all of you yuppies just can't wait to be just rampaged over.
[03:44:46.797 --> 03:44:48.137]  You love it!
[03:44:48.137 --> 03:44:54.460]  You love being weak scum, so you're gonna get what you want now.
[03:44:54.460 --> 03:45:07.407]  I'm actually just sick of my stomach by and all, so I gotta make a sick joke out of it all.
[03:45:07.407 --> 03:45:09.048]  You want slavery, you got it.
[03:45:12.225 --> 03:45:12.966]  Oh my God.
[03:45:12.966 --> 03:45:15.067]  That was bad, wasn't it, Craig?
[03:45:15.067 --> 03:45:18.309]  Was that my worst singing ever?
[03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:19.249]  Oh, man.
[03:45:19.249 --> 03:45:20.971]  No, actually, we're not in a police state.
[03:45:20.971 --> 03:45:23.532]  Everything's fine, folks.
[03:45:23.532 --> 03:45:23.972]  Everything.
[03:45:23.972 --> 03:45:26.914]  Hey, Glenn Beck's got a plan to fix it.
[03:45:26.914 --> 03:45:28.855]  Value-added tax and sales tax.
[03:45:28.855 --> 03:45:31.817]  That'll teach the liberals.
[03:45:31.817 --> 03:45:36.100]  We're going to show them.
[03:45:36.100 --> 03:45:37.321]  Adam, you're on the air.
[03:45:37.321 --> 03:45:37.681]  Go ahead.
[03:45:38.800 --> 03:45:40.561]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:45:40.561 --> 03:45:50.104]  Quick question, is there a website, a one-stop shop I can go to, to dig up these declassified articles?
[03:45:50.104 --> 03:46:03.788]  I talk to a lot of people, and it's really hard to talk to them about what's going on today, but I can say, well, these are eugenicists, and I explain what eugenics is, and then I can rattle off, I mean, you're the king, you're like the Van Emp of
[03:46:04.685 --> 03:46:29.171]  of uh... conspiracy theories you can say section are article forty five you know reads that it is so is there a one-stop shop i can go to to dig up all this information not just on eugenics but all like to ski the project that it did uh... that it uh... i mean though the list can go on to tell these people uh... hey look this is what they've done in the past this is their fruits
[03:46:29.867 --> 03:46:31.808]  You know, look at the fruits of their labor.
[03:46:31.808 --> 03:46:34.090]  Who's saying they're not doing it right now?
[03:46:34.090 --> 03:46:34.890]  Well, hold on.
[03:46:34.890 --> 03:46:44.996]  I mean, you can give them scores of articles about one-child policy being proposed at the Copenhagen event and world government being proposed.
[03:46:44.996 --> 03:46:47.858]  There's whatistheendgame.com.
[03:46:47.858 --> 03:46:54.022]  It's an online bibliography for the film, so everything in the film is covered there.
[03:46:54.022 --> 03:46:57.324]  But, I mean, what person doesn't know about Tuskegee?
[03:47:00.660 --> 03:47:06.164]  I mean, I think we should keep educating people, because now they're really ready to listen.
[03:47:06.164 --> 03:47:11.509]  But, I mean, people ask for documentation.
[03:47:11.509 --> 03:47:12.649]  It's all over the place.
[03:47:12.649 --> 03:47:14.671]  I mean, what specifically?
[03:47:14.671 --> 03:47:26.120]  I mean, the Department of Energy admits they radiated 4,300-plus American children, many of them to death, in secret tests declassified in the 80s.
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:29.322]  They admit that 34 states passed laws for forced sterilization.
[03:47:31.829 --> 03:47:34.350]  I mean, the film Endgame is a testament.
[03:47:34.350 --> 03:47:37.490]  It has all the documents and articles and things there.
[03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:38.771]  You can give people that film.
[03:47:38.771 --> 03:47:41.971]  I mean, what are they asking for?
[03:47:41.971 --> 03:47:51.533]  Well, in particular, it's just, I admire that you can rattle off all these, you know, things and sources.
[03:47:51.533 --> 03:47:54.174]  Yeah, but they can rattle off Dallas Cowboys scores.
[03:47:55.099 --> 03:47:56.319]  Anybody can do what I do.
[03:47:56.319 --> 03:48:03.941]  I've just been into this for six... I just don't have a lot of time to research all that because I'm a working... Well, they better make the time!
[03:48:03.941 --> 03:48:05.601]  Well, I'm just saying for myself.
[03:48:05.601 --> 03:48:07.242]  I mean, I would like to have a one-stop shop.
[03:48:07.242 --> 03:48:09.162]  What's that website again?
[03:48:09.162 --> 03:48:11.082]  Whatistheendgame.com.
[03:48:11.082 --> 03:48:12.303]  Whatistheendgame.com.
[03:48:12.303 --> 03:48:13.383]  Okay, thank you so much.
[03:48:13.383 --> 03:48:14.283]  I really appreciate your time.
[03:48:14.283 --> 03:48:14.803]  Hey, thank you, Adam.
[03:48:14.803 --> 03:48:17.004]  I appreciate your call putting up with me.
[03:48:17.004 --> 03:48:22.065]  Because, I mean, believe me... Look, that's the whole... That's the big joke here.
[03:48:22.065 --> 03:48:23.685]  Is I'm actually a sane person.
[03:48:25.541 --> 03:48:33.149]  And I decided that a government admittedly poisoning my water supply was more important than knowing about the cowboys.
[03:48:33.149 --> 03:48:35.711]  Call me a kook, you know.
[03:48:35.711 --> 03:48:45.461]  Oh, there's a planetary world government that wants to set up a police state so you can, uh... If my daughters ever try to have children kill their second-born babies, oh, that's being proposed publicly?
[03:48:45.461 --> 03:48:48.324]  Oh, I better get up off my fat butt and do something.
[03:48:50.538 --> 03:48:58.583]  They're like, I don't know man, you're some kind of weirdo, pretty wild, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[03:48:58.583 --> 03:48:59.863]  Just get me out of here!
[03:48:59.863 --> 03:49:01.704]  I mean, how do I shut this off?
[03:49:01.704 --> 03:49:06.787]  How do I... I'm gonna shut up.
[03:49:06.787 --> 03:49:08.749]  Byrne in Canada.
[03:49:08.749 --> 03:49:11.330]  We're on the air, welcome Byrne.
[03:49:11.330 --> 03:49:12.511]  Hey Alex.
[03:49:12.511 --> 03:49:13.611]  Hey pal.
[03:49:13.611 --> 03:49:17.634]  Hey, I just want to bring you up to speed what's happening in British Columbia, Canada.
[03:49:18.905 --> 03:49:24.908]  We've been paying the carbon tax for over a year now on our hydro and our natural gas.
[03:49:24.908 --> 03:49:26.009]  Yes.
[03:49:26.009 --> 03:49:35.534]  And our little premier there, Mr. Gordon Puke Campbell, has gone to Copenhagen with Mr. Harper with his checkbook.
[03:49:35.534 --> 03:49:43.279]  He went to, I think, the Bank of England here a couple years ago and borrowed a whole whack of cash for our Olympics.
[03:49:43.279 --> 03:49:46.621]  And, you know, the Bank of Canada just can't come up with the money, I guess.
[03:49:47.847 --> 03:49:51.070]  You know, it's to the point now where they're double.
[03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:59.057]  And remember, he was going to be the conservative, and he spoke out against Bilderberg, and now he's completely run by them.
[03:49:59.057 --> 03:49:59.557]  Oh, yeah.
[03:49:59.557 --> 03:50:02.380]  Yeah, he's a big-time Freemason in the whole nine yards.
[03:50:02.380 --> 03:50:12.969]  You know, he got busted in Hawaii for drinking and driving, and everybody looked the other way, and, you know, his mug shot, he's smiling and snickering a little puke.
[03:50:12.969 --> 03:50:14.711]  But, yeah, just to let you know,
[03:50:15.458 --> 03:50:20.723]  You know, we're already paying this carbon tax here for a year, and I don't know, where's it going?
[03:50:21.772 --> 03:50:23.554]  You know, is he just sending it over there?
[03:50:23.554 --> 03:50:25.535]  Is he collecting interest anywhere?
[03:50:25.535 --> 03:50:31.621]  Well, I remember three years ago, Canada passed it, but it had that staggered thing where it was started in a year and a half.
[03:50:31.621 --> 03:50:36.345]  So you've had it for a year and a half, and they're saying they're going to expand it.
[03:50:36.345 --> 03:50:38.026]  It's an open-ended mandate.
[03:50:38.026 --> 03:50:41.509]  And I would have guests on, and they would say, there's no carbon tax in Canada.
[03:50:41.509 --> 03:50:42.670]  You're a liar!
[03:50:42.670 --> 03:50:46.434]  See how they denied it right up until it was too late?
[03:50:47.964 --> 03:50:52.527]  I mean, they just, it's all a military handbook they use.
[03:50:52.527 --> 03:50:54.088]  I appreciate your call.
[03:50:54.088 --> 03:50:56.770]  I mean, these people are just a pack of scum criminals.
[03:50:56.770 --> 03:50:58.552]  What does it take for people to get it?
[03:50:58.552 --> 03:51:01.754]  And they're arming against us with paramilitary police!
[03:51:01.754 --> 03:51:07.438]  When the electricity goes out, how will you boil water, cook dinner, light your home, or get news reports?
[03:51:07.438 --> 03:51:12.762]  Most families are not prepared for even the shortest power outages due to hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, and so on.
[03:51:12.762 --> 03:51:16.044]  But you can prepare your family for emergencies and not spend a lot
[03:51:16.124 --> 03:51:16.624]  We're good to go!
[03:51:46.286 --> 03:51:49.847]  And you'll be surprised how little you'll spend on Carol Stove's incredible products.
[03:51:49.847 --> 03:51:52.728]  For example, our most popular single burner stove starts at only $58.
[03:51:52.728 --> 03:51:56.829]  See our complete line of quality stoves and ovens at carolstove.com.
[03:51:56.829 --> 03:51:58.770]  That's K-E-R-O stove dot com.

[03:52:03.011 --> 03:52:07.032]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.032 --> 03:52:10.293]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.293 --> 03:52:11.694]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.615 --> 03:52:15.076]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.076 --> 03:52:21.477]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.477 --> 03:52:26.659]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.659 --> 03:52:36.641]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.761 --> 03:52:39.103]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.103 --> 03:52:40.705]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.705 --> 03:52:43.167]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.167 --> 03:52:45.290]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.290 --> 03:52:50.455]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.455 --> 03:52:55.460]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:53:05.405 --> 03:53:15.593]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:53:58.033 --> 03:53:59.634]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:54:23.086 --> 03:54:25.267]  Talking about the global government.
[03:54:25.267 --> 03:54:32.090]  And the title of this clip, we just searched it, was Congressman Rohrabacher channels Alex Jones.
[03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:34.631]  So here's a short clip of that.
[03:54:34.631 --> 03:54:43.875]  Copenhagen may well lay the foundations for the future that the globalists who are pushing this agenda envision for us.
[03:54:45.475 --> 03:54:56.884]  What the Copenhagen crowd would mandate and can be traced back to that same alliance between our domestic radical environmentalists and a globalist elite.
[03:54:56.884 --> 03:55:00.186]  This unholy alliance has already had an impact.
[03:55:01.107 --> 03:55:13.791]  A few decades ago, the Global Radical Environmental Alliance, the Globalist Radical Environmental Alliance, latched on to an apocalyptic theory to justify their power grab.
[03:55:13.791 --> 03:55:18.052]  This is a product of a radical environmentalist globalist coalition.
[03:55:18.052 --> 03:55:22.853]  This is about centralizing power into the hands of global government.
[03:55:22.853 --> 03:55:25.454]  That's what Kyoto and Copenhagen are all about.
[03:55:25.454 --> 03:55:28.955]  That's what the Radical Environmentalist and Globalist Alliance is all about.
[03:55:29.907 --> 03:55:32.289]  Wake up, America!
[03:55:32.289 --> 03:55:35.692]  We still have time to turn this around.
[03:55:35.692 --> 03:55:45.461]  We must fight the globalist clique that is trying to shackle future generations of Americans to a burden of economy-killing debt.
[03:55:45.461 --> 03:55:54.549]  They are chains that will be hard to break, but we must have the strength and the commitment to do so.
[03:55:54.549 --> 03:55:56.171]  We will not give up our freedom.
[03:55:57.398 --> 03:55:59.859]  Now, ThinkProgress put that clip out.
[03:55:59.859 --> 03:56:01.319]  That's George Soros funded.
[03:56:01.319 --> 03:56:01.899]  I've looked him up.
[03:56:01.899 --> 03:56:03.120]  It's one of his publications.
[03:56:26.255 --> 03:56:29.176]  Like, that's discrediting Rohrabacher.
[03:56:29.176 --> 03:56:34.376]  I mean, you've got Ban Ki-moon, Van Rompuy, all the heads of it saying global government.
[03:56:34.376 --> 03:56:36.997]  The Stinkin' Treaty says global governance.
[03:56:36.997 --> 03:56:40.558]  Al Gore says global governance.
[03:56:40.558 --> 03:56:48.639]  And they keep playing along like, we want global government, we're going to take over and one-child policy, but none of it exists and you're a crazy kook if you talk about it.
[03:56:48.639 --> 03:56:51.560]  I mean, it's like they are the arbiters of reality.
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:53.420]  But see, people aren't listening to them anymore.
[03:56:54.622 --> 03:57:00.024]  You just might have worked 10 years ago to tell people there were no chemtrails or no New World Order.
[03:57:00.024 --> 03:57:12.028]  But you can't have the White House Science Center going, actually, since my days at Harvard, I've been involved in a secret terraforming project on planet Earth called geoengineering to stop the global warming.
[03:57:12.028 --> 03:57:15.910]  We're now going from the testing phase to the operational phase.
[03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:20.811]  I mean, you can pull up the YouTube of him in an AP press conference saying it.
[03:57:20.811 --> 03:57:22.232]  They're spraying you!
[03:57:24.787 --> 03:57:26.348]  Then the stupid cops don't care!
[03:57:26.348 --> 03:57:27.468]  They love it!
[03:57:27.468 --> 03:57:28.929]  They love their kids being retarded!
[03:57:28.929 --> 03:57:32.351]  I mean, I... I know a lot of cops are waking up.
[03:57:32.351 --> 03:57:40.114]  Look... Police, I talk a lot about you because you're going to be used to enforce all this, and you're destroying yourselves as well.
[03:57:40.114 --> 03:57:42.676]  And I just... I'm telling you the truth.
[03:57:42.676 --> 03:57:44.377]  The world government's real.
[03:57:44.377 --> 03:57:46.117]  We have to stand up against it.
[03:57:46.117 --> 03:57:46.998]  We have to say no.
[03:57:48.717 --> 03:57:49.378]  I'm out of time.
[03:57:49.378 --> 03:57:51.900]  I apologize to Joe and Brian and Paul and Chris.
[03:57:51.900 --> 03:57:53.361]  If you call back tomorrow, I'll put you ahead of the line.
[03:57:53.361 --> 03:58:01.207]  We do have some really big guests up tomorrow as well.
[03:58:01.207 --> 03:58:08.493]  I wanted to just add here that it is Christmas time and your purchases of books and videos and materiel supports my operation here.
[03:58:09.465 --> 03:58:12.250]  But most importantly, it wakes your friends and families and neighbors up.
[03:58:12.250 --> 03:58:14.053]  You don't have to fight traffic.
[03:58:14.053 --> 03:58:16.236]  We can ship it out to you well before Christmas.
[03:58:16.236 --> 03:58:18.279]  We're shipping every day or so.
[03:58:18.279 --> 03:58:18.941]  Great turnaround.
[03:58:20.333 --> 03:58:24.156]  With the orders, we've really gotten a lot better than we used to be.
[03:58:24.156 --> 03:58:32.021]  And you can get Fall of the Republic in a free t-shirt with it, free DVDs, right now at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[03:58:36.184 --> 03:58:38.706]  If you missed any of it at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:38.706 --> 03:58:39.467]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:39.467 --> 03:58:40.548]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:40.548 --> 03:58:44.290]  Central.
[03:58:44.290 --> 03:58:46.752]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.752 --> 03:58:49.054]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.687 --> 03:58:56.230]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:56.230 --> 03:58:57.130]  Number one.
[03:58:57.130 --> 03:59:00.572]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.572 --> 03:59:01.433]  Number two.
[03:59:01.433 --> 03:59:06.315]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.315 --> 03:59:07.056]  It's true.
[03:59:07.056 --> 03:59:11.939]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.939 --> 03:59:12.459]  Number three.
[03:59:12.739 --> 03:59:16.322]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:16.322 --> 03:59:21.045]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:21.045 --> 03:59:23.808]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.808 --> 03:59:28.291]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:28.291 --> 03:59:32.434]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:32.434 --> 03:59:37.198]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
