[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.677]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.259]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.181]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.008]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:29.831]  Well, we're into our number two simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color.
[00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:41.216]  Joining us from Minnesota, he's about to travel down to Mexico to do some surfing, is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, of course a star of films like
[00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:45.621]  The Running Man, Predator, and many other films.
[00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.925]  He's hosted a MSNBC national television show.
[00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:52.268]  He's hosted NFL football.
[00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:54.030]  There's not much this guy hadn't done.
[00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.012]  And now he's got a huge show.
[00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:58.575]  They're saying it's going to be their big push in the winter.
[00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:00.117]  Their big number one promoted show.
[00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:01.839]  And I'm seeing that now in the media.
[00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.141]  That's conspiracy theory created by Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:07.262]  I'm a consultant on it.
[00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:08.343]  I'm in some of the episodes.
[00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:10.784]  I'm very honored to be involved in it.
[00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:14.367]  And to give you the inside scoop, he starts the media blitz tomorrow.
[00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:18.129]  To give you the inside scoop, is Jesse Ventura with us for the next hour?
[00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:22.552]  We may twist his arm a little bit in the next hour to take some phone calls, but we'll see.
[00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:24.613]  Governor, it is good to have you here with us.
[00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:28.775]  Hi Alex, great to be here again.
[00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.977]  I guess I should call you Huggy Bear.
[00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.652]  And I'll explain that for a moment.
[00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:38.573]  Now, Alex has been good enough.
[00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:42.774]  He appears in a couple of the episodes of Conspiracy Theory that we did.
[00:01:42.774 --> 00:01:52.998]  And so, because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial dive, we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show.
[00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:54.958]  And you all remember Huggy Bear, don't you?
[00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.740]  The guy that always brought the information to Starsky and Hutch?
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.940]  Yes.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.880]  Well, that's you now, Alex.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.041]  So you're our Huggy Bear.
[00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.673]  Well, I'm honored to be your huggy bear.
[00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:09.094]  You've not been able to talk about the show till now.
[00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:10.715]  They've unleashed you.
[00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:24.742]  You barely talked about it on Larry King Live last week, but now you've been given the green light to give people a foretaste or an idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes.
[00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:26.203]  And so we're all ears, Governor.
[00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:27.604]  I mean, tell us about some of the episodes.
[00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:40.995]  Well, first of all, when I went on Larry, it was because, you know, it was election night and Larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections, which I'll do this right now.
[00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.717]  To me, why do they even have off-year elections?
[00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:46.739]  It's hard enough to get people out there to vote.
[00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.581]  Have them all on here.
[00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:53.585]  They do that so that they get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control small numbers.
[00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:54.845]  We're good to go.
[00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:16.194]  I don't want to stop you.
[00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:24.880]  I want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because I've consulted some but I still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle
[00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:49.915]  And I know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective, probably the first television show ever that's actually from people who questions perspective.
[00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:53.997]  That doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being said out there.
[00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:56.518]  So I want to talk about that when we come back in just a minute.
[00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:04.322]  But in the one minute we've got, what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over the country and Obama's plunging approval rating?
[00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:08.344]  Well, I don't think it's so much Republicans sweeping.
[00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:15.989]  As you know, they lost that congressional race up in that heavily Republican district in New York that hadn't gone Democrat.
[00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.711]  Yeah, but the Democrats threw that.
[00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.371]  They threw that.
[00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:20.413]  I mean, they had their... Well, maybe so.
[00:04:20.413 --> 00:04:23.195]  Well, to me, the elections are truly irrelevant.
[00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.877]  And as far as Obama's ratings falling,
[00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:29.139]  Um, that's a natural occurrence.
[00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:38.544]  You know, I don't want to throw water on the fire or anything for those people, you know, for whatever reason, but I at one time had 72% approval ratings.
[00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:44.548]  Well, certainly by the time you get out of office, mine actually dipped below 50 later.
[00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:46.189]  No, no, you're right!
[00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.811]  When you have to make hard decisions,
[00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:56.424]  When you make those hard decisions, some people aren't going to like it, and a lot of people are one issue people.
[00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:58.287]  Jesse, we got a break.
[00:04:58.287 --> 00:04:58.828]  We got a break.
[00:04:58.828 --> 00:04:59.349]  Stay right there.
[00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.241]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:11.301]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:16.302]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.302 --> 00:05:17.482]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:18.602]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:20.483]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.483 --> 00:05:21.563]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:23.763]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:25.103]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:26.624]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:27.684]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:29.165]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:31.886]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.886 --> 00:05:35.467]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:39.289]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.529]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:41.430]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.530]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.471]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:44.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.592]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:55.135]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:55.135 --> 00:06:01.918]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:05.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.181]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:10.582]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.971]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:20.357]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.357 --> 00:06:25.541]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:35.549]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.991]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:39.592]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.592 --> 00:06:42.054]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:44.175]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:49.319]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:58.446]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:05.157]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:08.422]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:16.214]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[00:07:16.474 --> 00:07:18.696]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:21.078]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[00:07:21.078 --> 00:07:27.903]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:34.087]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.689]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:44.055]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market, and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.580]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.360]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.121]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:11.702]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:12.662]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.662 --> 00:08:17.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:22.447]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.447 --> 00:08:29.170]  Well, surf's up, ladies and gentlemen, and here comes Jesse Ventura into the Info War.
[00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.672]  Coming up in early December, the launch of his long-awaited
[00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.453]  Television show, Conspiracy Theory on True TV.
[00:08:37.453 --> 00:08:42.198]  Here to tell us dates and times and inside details first on this radio show.
[00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:47.883]  When Jesse called me back Friday evening and said, okay, I'll do your show first, I was extremely honored.
[00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:52.207]  And so Governor, I really do appreciate you coming here first to talk about it.
[00:08:52.207 --> 00:08:53.449]  I know the media blitz starts
[00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:55.531]  Later today and tomorrow.
[00:09:10.518 --> 00:09:12.940]  Yeah, that's true Alex, but it's going to happen.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.724]  You know, the honeymoon wears off, the hard decisions have to be made.
[00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:23.650]  People many times disagree with those tough decisions and your approval rating starts to fall.
[00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.852]  The positive for me, the way I always looked at it, was like this.
[00:09:26.852 --> 00:09:30.456]  I was in a three-way race, not a two-way race.
[00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:32.577]  I run with only 37%.
[00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:40.924]  So even if my approval say fell all the way to 45, that was still 8 points higher than what I run with.
[00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:44.087]  He had to have been lower than 39.
[00:09:53.473 --> 00:09:55.396]  Yeah, some approval ratings had him at 25.
[00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:56.337]  I mean, there's so many polls.
[00:09:56.337 --> 00:09:59.502]  Well, I don't know, Jesse, what's wrong with the hardcore Republicans?
[00:09:59.502 --> 00:10:05.010]  In the end, I can't see him even getting over 30% approval rating.
[00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.934]  Well, I know Congress... That's just a political gift from his party.
[00:10:09.128 --> 00:10:09.589]  Exactly.
[00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:16.319]  I know that the overall Congress, both parties, had an 11% when he left office, and it's now going back down that direction again.
[00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:24.671]  My point is, Obama's approval rating has broken records, according to the major pollsters, for falling the fastest in the first year of a new administration.
[00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:28.433]  And now he's losing his base.
[00:10:28.433 --> 00:10:34.257]  CBS News last night reported he is putting in 40,000 more troops in Afghanistan.
[00:10:34.257 --> 00:10:37.419]  And Jesse, I know you've researched this and are well-read on this subject.
[00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:39.421]  Let's talk about this right now and then get into the show.
[00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:53.092]  There's 12 times the opium, 12 times coming out of Afghanistan, of what was coming out 8 years ago, and even the BBC admits our troops are guarding the opium so, quote, the Taliban doesn't get it.
[00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:57.214]  No, that's so the banks can launder $500 billion in smack every year.
[00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:58.935]  Governor Ventura, your take on this war?
[00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:03.697]  Well, to me, welcome in my lifetime now.
[00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:05.098]  How wonderful it is.
[00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:06.719]  Welcome to another Vietnam.
[00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.571]  It's that simple.
[00:11:10.571 --> 00:11:12.412]  It's going to accomplish nothing.
[00:11:12.412 --> 00:11:18.354]  Guys are going to die over there on a constant basis as they have in Iraq.
[00:11:18.354 --> 00:11:21.215]  And, you know, welcome to another Vietnam.
[00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:26.678]  When this is all over and done with, I do it right now, Alex.
[00:11:26.678 --> 00:11:34.181]  I sit back and go, how is Jesse Ventura benefiting from these two wars?
[00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:35.442]  And I can't think of a thing.
[00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:42.902]  And yet, we've got people out there protesting whether people should be able to go see a doctor or not.
[00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:52.011]  If we wouldn't have fought these two wars, we'd have plenty of money for healthcare, wouldn't we?
[00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:59.819]  And my point is, wars are the most destructive thing mankind can do.
[00:12:00.646 --> 00:12:03.887]  And when he engages in them, it has no benefit.
[00:12:03.887 --> 00:12:14.951]  It's like Herman Goering said, the best thing a farmer can get out of a war is to be able to come back on the same farm he left before the war started.
[00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.592]  That's the best outcome.
[00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:17.972]  The very best.
[00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:20.853]  There will be nothing more than that.
[00:12:20.853 --> 00:12:24.695]  And when is this country going to wake up?
[00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:25.355]  You know?
[00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:26.796]  I sit back and I'm appalled.
[00:12:28.374 --> 00:12:28.474]  Well,
[00:12:51.903 --> 00:13:09.133]  They can't win the state of objective to bring democracy and freedom to Afghanistan, but if the objective is to destabilize the region and have bases to menace Iran and China, and if the state of objective, you know, the real objective is to launder drug proceeds, then it's mission accomplished.
[00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:10.774]  They just need to sit there.
[00:13:10.774 --> 00:13:15.077]  Well, if that's indeed what it is, Alex, then you will be, you're absolutely correct.
[00:13:15.077 --> 00:13:16.258]  It's mission accomplished.
[00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.159]  If that's what they're accomplishing out of this,
[00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:34.709]  I can't prove that that's what they are or aren't doing at this time, but certainly from a base perspective of Jesse Ventura, American citizen, I don't understand how I benefit by these wars one bit or any of the rest of us benefit by them one bit.
[00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:37.251]  Okay, here's an example, then we'll get into the TV show.
[00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:37.952]  Sure.
[00:13:37.952 --> 00:13:43.577]  I know you've been busy with, you know, producing the television show and flying all over the country, and we'll talk about that.
[00:13:43.577 --> 00:13:44.938]  You are really working hard on this.
[00:13:44.938 --> 00:13:47.320]  A lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of money.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.164]  More money than I wanted.
[00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:59.171]  But at the same time, it came out two weeks ago, New York Times, that Mohammed Karzai's brother is the head opium kingpin in Afghanistan.
[00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:10.580]  And that he is a CIA operative on CIA payroll, and that basically so is Mohammed Karzai, and that our troops are guarding his poppy fields.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:17.323]  And I was driving down the road a few months ago and heard BBC report the same thing before the New York Times did, and I already knew that!
[00:14:18.286 --> 00:14:26.819]  But to hear them report that, oh, we guard the opium because if we don't guard it, another Taliban group will get it and then they'll get too much power.
[00:14:26.819 --> 00:14:27.921]  That's what they're telling the troops.
[00:14:27.921 --> 00:14:29.664]  We guard the opium to win the war.
[00:14:29.664 --> 00:14:31.767]  You know the CIA got caught with opium in
[00:14:33.288 --> 00:14:38.249]  And add to that the fact that that's how the CIA gets their revenue so that they can then do operations that they can keep away from Congress.
[00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:11.201]  Because if they have to do operations that require them to get money from our tax money, then they have to be forward enough to let Congress know what they're doing with the money.
[00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:27.229]  But if they're getting money via illegal drugs, and making all sorts of money out of that end of the world, they then don't have to declare any of that to Congress, and that's when they can do these dirty jobs that the American public will never know about.
[00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:31.602]  Governor Jesse Ventura, that is the nail on the head.
[00:15:31.602 --> 00:15:32.282]  Absolutely.
[00:15:32.282 --> 00:15:34.202]  I hadn't even thought to make that point.
[00:15:34.202 --> 00:15:44.184]  All those tens of billions in unaccountable money that these private... That's how they run their operations, so that they don't have to be accountable to the Congress.
[00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:44.764]  Absolutely.
[00:15:44.764 --> 00:15:55.346]  In fact, in 96, that came out on C-SPAN with the CIA Inspector General testifying that the CIA brought in the crack cocaine epidemic.
[00:15:58.502 --> 00:16:00.667]  Well, that I don't know.
[00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:02.791]  If you know about that, Alex, I don't.
[00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:04.855]  I can only speak to what I know about.
[00:16:04.855 --> 00:16:09.365]  And, you know, you're better well read on it than I am.
[00:16:10.501 --> 00:16:16.122]  Well no, I mean, you know as much or more than I do, you just brought up the key point that they're funding their black operations with this.
[00:16:16.122 --> 00:16:20.283]  Oh yeah, no, I've felt that and known that for a long, long time.
[00:16:20.283 --> 00:16:22.544]  That that's the simple way to do it.
[00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:25.705]  That's how you keep it out of the public eye.
[00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:31.586]  That's how you can get money to do political assassinations like in the old days when they used to attempt to kill Castro.
[00:16:32.777 --> 00:16:33.838]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:41.867]  If they do that, if they get money from Congress, then they have to submit reports and it has to be far more above board.
[00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:52.920]  But if they get the money from somewhere else, which can be dirty drug money, well then they can spend it on any operations they want to do and they don't have to be accountable to the American public or the Congress for it.
[00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:54.548]  Absolutely.
[00:16:54.548 --> 00:16:58.230]  Governor, we've got you here to talk about the TV show, so I'm going to stop getting off on other issues.
[00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:05.935]  I apologize, but it's always interesting to hear your truthful perspective, because you're absolutely right on those issues.
[00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:08.056]  Where to start with the TV show?
[00:17:08.056 --> 00:17:16.280]  I mean, I've seen the one promo clip where you went out to harp, and they threatened to arrest you, and then suddenly the equipment went dead.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.402]  Let's go through the seven episodes and give people an idea of what's coming up.
[00:17:19.762 --> 00:17:22.783]  Well, hopefully I can remember them all.
[00:17:22.783 --> 00:17:31.285]  I'll tell you, it was so hectic shooting them that sometimes I had to jump from one episode to another episode.
[00:17:31.285 --> 00:17:40.808]  And that plays games with your mind because you're focused in on one thing and then, you know, the next half a day you might be doing something for a completely different episode.
[00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:41.628]  Let me ask this.
[00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:43.068]  What's your favorite?
[00:17:43.068 --> 00:17:44.789]  What's your favorite episode?
[00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:47.250]  I would say my favorite one would be 9-11.
[00:17:49.290 --> 00:18:01.777]  Because I think 9-11 was the original one that I took to the two TV people to sell them on this show, and so it was personal to me because of my investigation of it so far.
[00:18:01.777 --> 00:18:07.440]  So I would have to say that that one is the most satisfying, although they all are, pretty much.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.101]  And I'll put it to you this way.
[00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:12.103]  The way that I'm going to explain it is quite simple, Alex.
[00:18:12.663 --> 00:18:19.710]  People can choose to believe the conspiracies or not, all seven of these, and they're all fairly modern day.
[00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:29.319]  The one thing True Channel wanted to do, we don't go back to Kennedy, we don't go back, they wanted to keep this first series within the last decade, pretty much.
[00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:37.627]  And you can choose to believe them or you can choose not to believe them, but I'll guarantee you this, if you watch this show, you're going to get scared.
[00:18:39.845 --> 00:18:48.589]  Even if they're not true, there is still the element that they may be, they might be, and they could be.
[00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:49.649]  And maybe they are.
[00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:53.531]  And that should be enough to wake people up and scare them.
[00:18:53.531 --> 00:18:58.112]  This is the first show that I've ever done in my career where I got scared.
[00:18:58.112 --> 00:18:59.453]  And I don't get scared easy.
[00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:08.751]  I remember a few weeks ago, I ran into you and we were checking in at the hotel, and you walked up and you were shaking your head and you said, Alex.
[00:19:08.751 --> 00:19:12.696]  You were there with your son Tyrell, who's working on the show as well, doing a great job.
[00:19:12.696 --> 00:19:17.342]  You walked up and you said, Alex, when I go to bed at night, my head's spinning with all this information.
[00:19:17.342 --> 00:19:18.724]  This stuff is scary.
[00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:19.044]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:29.713]  No, we went into some places that you think is only fantasy land, but it could very well be reality land.
[00:19:29.713 --> 00:19:34.657]  It's stuff that people don't even think about, don't deal with in their daily lives.
[00:19:34.657 --> 00:19:36.278]  That's one of the main things is people
[00:19:36.858 --> 00:19:46.326]  People out there have to earn a living, they have to make a living for their families, so they haven't got time to go delving into the underhanded stuff that government might be doing.
[00:19:46.326 --> 00:19:57.936]  It's interesting, Alex, that we started this show with the concept that we were going to show both sides of the conspiracy, and then allow the viewer to make a choice at the end of which one he or she would choose to believe.
[00:19:57.936 --> 00:19:58.597]  Hold it there!
[00:19:58.597 --> 00:19:59.478]  Got it right, Governor.
[00:19:59.478 --> 00:20:00.539]  This is a key info...
[00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:03.701]  I believe Obama is creating runaway inflation.
[00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:07.063]  I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity with a free kit.
[00:20:07.063 --> 00:20:08.304]  First, the facts.
[00:20:08.304 --> 00:20:11.286]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.
[00:20:11.286 --> 00:20:16.549]  $700 billion for TARP, $122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:17.390]  The result?
[00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:23.154]  A deficit of over $1.8 trillion and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above 20%.
[00:20:25.755 --> 00:20:27.236]  Now, the good news.
[00:20:27.236 --> 00:20:36.524]  Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter, created a free inflation survival kit.
[00:20:36.524 --> 00:20:42.588]  The kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much as $431,000 in 12 to 18 months.
[00:20:42.588 --> 00:20:43.529]  If you're thinking about gold,
[00:20:48.473 --> 00:20:50.434]  Get this free kit now by calling 888-314-8782.
[00:20:50.434 --> 00:20:50.794]  That's 888-314-8782.
[00:20:50.794 --> 00:20:52.275]  Or go to the website, InflationSurvivalKit.com.
[00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:02.952]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.952 --> 00:21:03.812]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.812 --> 00:21:04.133]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.133 --> 00:21:09.175]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.175 --> 00:21:10.816]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.816 --> 00:21:11.556]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.556 --> 00:21:11.976]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:13.077]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.077 --> 00:21:16.038]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.038 --> 00:21:19.900]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.701]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:25.663]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.663 --> 00:21:27.244]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:27.544]  Right!

[00:21:31.426 --> 00:21:32.787]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.787 --> 00:21:36.649]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:40.432]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:00.609 --> 00:22:07.271]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:15.394]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.394 --> 00:22:23.557]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.557 --> 00:22:28.299]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:33.860]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.221]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:39.301]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:43.802]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:51.704]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:56.525 --> 00:22:58.806]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.806 --> 00:23:00.706]  Hello.
[00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:05.447]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:10.268]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:23:10.268 --> 00:23:15.330]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.011]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:24.092]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:23:24.212 --> 00:23:28.573]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:33.134]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:23:33.134 --> 00:23:35.214]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:37.374]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:39.295]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:23:39.295 --> 00:23:44.996]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:23:44.996 --> 00:23:48.396]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:23:48.396 --> 00:23:51.117]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:56.339]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:24:19.085 --> 00:24:20.946]  All right, going back to Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:24:20.946 --> 00:24:23.768]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:24:23.768 --> 00:24:25.369]  He'll be with us a little bit into the next hour.
[00:24:25.369 --> 00:24:34.775]  We're going to open the phones up specifically only for Governor Jesse Ventura at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.775 --> 00:24:37.137]  Quick question or comment for the Governor coming up.
[00:24:37.137 --> 00:24:39.718]  Okay, you got cut off again by the satellite.
[00:24:39.718 --> 00:24:40.719]  I'm making this go to break.
[00:24:40.719 --> 00:24:45.922]  Start over, start over Governor with the point that you were making about the TV show.
[00:24:46.983 --> 00:24:54.785]  Initially, Alex, we started off to do the show with the concept that both sides of the conspiracy would be told, if there were two sides.
[00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:58.026]  Many times there may be multiple sides.
[00:24:58.026 --> 00:25:01.187]  But the two major sides, and then we'd let the viewer decide.
[00:25:01.187 --> 00:25:12.911]  Well, then the show had to go through a metamorphosis, if you will, or an evolution, whatever you want to call it, because when one side does not cooperate one bit, it is pretty hard to tell their story.
[00:25:13.651 --> 00:25:16.493]  And that was the case of the United States government.
[00:25:16.493 --> 00:25:25.639]  I did an interview the other day, a print interview, and the person asked me, and I said, well, you know, the government hasn't cooperated at all.
[00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:28.601]  And they said, this includes when Obama's taken over.
[00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:29.922]  I said, there's been no difference.
[00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:42.559]  I said it hasn't made one bit of difference, because we started the show, George Bush was still the president, and the show's been in the works, and I've been working on it for a year now, basically, or better.
[00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:45.881]  And the government cooperated nothing.
[00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:46.721]  Zero.
[00:25:46.721 --> 00:25:47.642]  Zilch.
[00:25:47.642 --> 00:25:50.924]  We could not even get a spokesperson out for the government.
[00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:59.830]  Well, we do get a few former government people who are now no longer working for the government, who had courage enough to come out and talk to us and offer their opinions.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:19.029]  No one under the government would cooperate with the show at all, so then the show became simply more of the other side of the conspiracy being told, and now the viewer gets to see an alternative to what the government has pumped out in many occasions on the different conspiracies that they're involved with.
[00:26:19.409 --> 00:26:28.479]  And by the way, we've got Governor Jesse Ventura with us talking about the new TV show that's coming up in December and January called Conspiracy Theory on TruTV.
[00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:30.902]  Again, Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[00:26:30.902 --> 00:26:33.405]  How much can you tell us about the 9-11 episode?
[00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:37.109]  Because I know that more and more as you went out and tried to talk to them,
[00:26:37.882 --> 00:26:52.017]  No one would, and Jesse Ventura, Navy SEAL, Governor, fighter, is a lot more intimidating and a lot more effective than when Michael Moore, and I'm not against Michael Moore, kind of ninnies around.
[00:26:52.017 --> 00:26:56.301]  I mean, this is some dynamic confrontations.
[00:26:56.301 --> 00:27:00.065]  In many ways, Michael Moore probably got more cooperation than I got.
[00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:03.398]  Well, let folks in a little bit.
[00:27:03.398 --> 00:27:03.938]  None.
[00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:05.338]  I got none.
[00:27:05.338 --> 00:27:10.800]  When it came to 9-11, no one from the government would talk to the show.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.181]  No one from the 9-11 Commission would talk.
[00:27:14.181 --> 00:27:18.523]  No one representing any type of government agency would talk.
[00:27:18.523 --> 00:27:25.265]  You know, I don't want to wreck the show by saying what we did and where we did it and do all that because I want people to watch the show.
[00:27:25.265 --> 00:27:29.206]  The show came about like this.
[00:27:29.206 --> 00:27:30.647]  A victim came to me.
[00:27:31.787 --> 00:27:39.049]  And a victim pleaded with me, a victim who lost her daughter and her potential grandchild.
[00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:45.471]  Her daughter was pregnant and she died the day, the infamous day of 9-11.
[00:27:45.471 --> 00:27:55.034]  And her mom, you know, came to me feeling that I was the person with this show who could bring to light the fact that we need a real investigation of 9-11.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.300]  It's a natural progression.
[00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:18.450]  Unbelievable!
[00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:37.809]  Again, I don't want to give away too much, but... Well, I want people to watch.
[00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:39.630]  That's why I'm just going to talk.
[00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:48.934]  I'm not going to give specifics of the show, Alex, because I want everyone to enjoy the show, and I won't narrate it before it goes on the air.
[00:28:48.934 --> 00:28:55.516]  No, no, no, that's... I mean, you're giving us a lot here, and I know a lot of the inside baseball, and obviously I'm sworn to secrecy.
[00:28:55.516 --> 00:29:01.779]  I'm just telling folks, I'm surprised you're able to get this on air, Jesse, because... Well, Alex, it ain't on yet.
[00:29:06.123 --> 00:29:11.665]  I made a gentleman's bet at the start of this show that it would never see air.
[00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:21.348]  I felt we would complete them all, but I felt strongly that at some point in time someone wouldn't allow it, and so far it's full steam ahead.
[00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:31.250]  Now, we do have to wait until December 2nd because that's the airing again of the first show, which is, you know, a couple weeks away yet, three weeks away.
[00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.551]  In fact, I remember in October,
[00:29:34.341 --> 00:29:45.069]  You were in my car, we were driving around in the hill country, and you said, Alex, we're gonna find out if this airs, because I'm gonna do this from my perspective and be fair, we're gonna see what happens.
[00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:51.254]  And you've put incredible work into it, and now you've just upped the bar again, saying we'll see if it's gonna air.
[00:29:51.254 --> 00:29:55.197]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.197 --> 00:29:57.859]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:05.703]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:10.229]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:12.512]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.512 --> 00:30:14.134]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:14.134 --> 00:30:15.176]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:23.825]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:31:07.285 --> 00:31:08.566]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:32:56.772 --> 00:33:25.712]  Well, former Minnesota governor, former MSNBC host, former top wrestler, Hollywood movie star, best-selling author, multiple times over, and surfer,
[00:33:26.858 --> 00:33:28.322]  Jesse Ventura joins us.
[00:33:28.322 --> 00:33:29.444]  The surf is up.
[00:33:29.444 --> 00:33:29.885]  He is here.
[00:33:29.885 --> 00:33:31.428]  Okay, let's go through this then.
[00:33:31.428 --> 00:33:32.952]  Wait a minute, Alex.
[00:33:32.952 --> 00:33:36.559]  How's the surf since that storm has hit Alabama down there?
[00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.050]  You know what?
[00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:43.733]  I hear that there is a huge surf down at the Gulf right now, and every time I go down there, there's surfers everywhere.
[00:33:43.733 --> 00:33:46.915]  Well, I should be down there right now, doggone it.
[00:33:46.915 --> 00:33:59.141]  Why don't you just jump on an airplane, fly... Listen, you can fly to Corpus Christi in two hours from Minnesota, and three and a half, four hours from now, you could be on the beach in 12-foot swells.
[00:33:59.141 --> 00:34:04.424]  Well, I'll tell you, that's very tempting, but unfortunately, I've got too much publicity to do.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.564]  Unfortunately, you're here on air with us, but we're all happy, Governor.
[00:34:08.564 --> 00:34:12.249]  Well, it'd be tomorrow anyway, and so I got publicity all day tomorrow.
[00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:17.556]  Today, I couldn't get there in time, so it'd have to be tomorrow, but oh well, we'll pass on it this time.
[00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:20.881]  I'm certain there'll be more storms, especially after learning about HAARP.
[00:34:21.946 --> 00:34:22.627]  Absolutely.
[00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:29.195]  You know, I had the director of Harp on one time, and he admitted, oh, we turned the atmosphere on fire with it at night.
[00:34:29.195 --> 00:34:39.907]  He starts laughing, and then somebody on the line cut the line off, and my producer saw this, and during the break, an Air Force officer came on and said, you can't talk about that anymore.
[00:34:39.907 --> 00:34:41.569]  So the military was bossing the
[00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:54.664]  Well, what's interesting, and of course for those that don't know what HAARP is, HAARP is way up in Alaska, and that's one of the shows we go up to visit and photograph it.
[00:34:55.775 --> 00:35:03.702]  And it's a group of about 180 radio antennas that all shoot 50,000 watts of energy up into the biosphere.
[00:35:03.702 --> 00:35:10.727]  I should say of low frequency sounds up into the biosphere, which does cause a heating.
[00:35:10.727 --> 00:35:14.210]  Now Alex, let me ask you this.
[00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.712]  Could that possibly contribute to global warming?
[00:35:18.178 --> 00:35:18.898]  Absolutely.
[00:35:18.898 --> 00:35:27.720]  In fact, the scientists we've interviewed... This could be much more contributor of global warming than us driving our cars around.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.582]  Well, as you know, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 admitted to the Army Times they did have weather weapons then.
[00:35:33.582 --> 00:35:37.223]  And I've interviewed the former father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston.
[00:35:37.987 --> 00:35:41.148]  And clearly, I believe this is a false flag attack.
[00:35:41.148 --> 00:35:48.589]  We have had a lot of strange weather, and that naturally occurs, but there's been a lot of... Well, that's gonna be, that's the opening show, Alex.
[00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:54.571]  The opening show, December 2nd, is on HAARP, and I think people are gonna find it a very interesting show.
[00:35:54.571 --> 00:36:06.213]  I went all the way up to Alaska, and went to this location, and we jumped into a helicopter, and bear this in mind, this thing can knock airplanes out of the air.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:14.222]  And, uh, it's a very interesting thing going on up there.
[00:36:14.222 --> 00:36:21.145]  It's, the government, it falls under, let me put it this way, it falls under the military, the Air Force.
[00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:28.388]  And yet, it is given the distinction of being an unclassified research center, yet I was not allowed in.
[00:36:28.388 --> 00:36:34.490]  Now, bear in mind, I used to have a top-secret security clearance with the United States government.
[00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:50.429]  During my six years as a member of Underwater Demolition Team 12 and Seal Team 1, I was also a mayor and a governor, and yet I was not allowed to go into this supposed unclassified research center.
[00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:54.274]  If it's unclassified, anybody should be able to go in there.
[00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:57.686]  Well, that's a good point.
[00:36:57.686 --> 00:37:04.234]  Jesse, on this specific subject, we can get into more detail because this has been released to the media.
[00:37:04.234 --> 00:37:06.677]  I want to play this clip and then ask you about it.
[00:37:06.677 --> 00:37:11.523]  This is a one-minute clip of Governor Jesse Ventura being stopped at the gates.
[00:37:11.523 --> 00:37:14.987]  He's about to just, I guess, bull his way on in there.
[00:37:14.987 --> 00:37:16.489]  And suddenly,
[00:37:17.475 --> 00:37:18.855]  The equipment goes dead.
[00:37:18.855 --> 00:37:20.156]  And I talked to the crew.
[00:37:20.156 --> 00:37:22.856]  This really happened.
[00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:27.217]  So they were using some type of electronic warfare jamming system.
[00:37:27.217 --> 00:37:28.437]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:28.437 --> 00:37:30.938]  We really need to go through the Air Force.
[00:37:30.938 --> 00:37:31.578]  Well, we did.
[00:37:31.578 --> 00:37:32.938]  We got stonewalled.
[00:37:32.938 --> 00:37:35.739]  And this is strictly a research facility.
[00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:39.800]  Clearly, there's something going on here that they don't want people to know about.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.521]  There's a lot of cool science that we do with this facility.
[00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:44.421]  Come on man, I'm a Navy SEAL.
[00:37:44.421 --> 00:37:52.243]  The military don't do things unless it has a military purpose and a military purpose is destruction and waging war.
[00:37:52.243 --> 00:37:53.844]  It's a stalemate.
[00:37:53.844 --> 00:37:55.424]  Or is it?
[00:37:55.424 --> 00:37:58.945]  Back up a little bit from the gate so when people come through they won't feel intimidated.
[00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:03.480]  When I get denied something, I do the opposite of getting intimidated.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.461]  I get angry.
[00:38:04.461 --> 00:38:09.165]  Jesse is about to walk right on through, when suddenly... Hold on a second, guys.
[00:38:09.165 --> 00:38:09.905]  I got a problem.
[00:38:09.905 --> 00:38:12.888]  I'm getting harassed with interference.
[00:38:12.888 --> 00:38:18.252]  The camera equipment begins to go haywire.
[00:38:18.252 --> 00:38:22.435]  Something is interfering with the audio and video.
[00:38:22.435 --> 00:38:24.096]  This is more than unclassified.
[00:38:24.096 --> 00:38:24.697]  That's bullshit.
[00:38:28.209 --> 00:38:30.510]  Alright, now that was, that aired on CNN.
[00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.990]  The potty language was cut out.
[00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.252]  But I don't blame the governor under that bizarre stress.
[00:38:36.252 --> 00:38:41.094]  So, tell us what you can about the Harp episode, because this is amazing.
[00:38:41.094 --> 00:38:56.239]  Well, you know, we were denied access, as I said, and you know, even though the security clearances I've had in my life and holding the position of governor, I guess, Alex, the only way I guess I can get in there is to run and get re-elected to something again.
[00:38:57.105 --> 00:39:01.968]  You know, then maybe I would be high enough in the government that they would let me in and see what they're doing there.
[00:39:01.968 --> 00:39:07.512]  But, that aside, uh, and then we did have some problem now.
[00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:11.494]  It made it seem, I don't know what caused our cameras to go bad.
[00:39:11.494 --> 00:39:17.798]  I do, I am not going to specifically sit here and say that they jammed and that they did something to them.
[00:39:17.798 --> 00:39:24.623]  I will simply state that our audio and our visual did have some problems while we were outside the gate.
[00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:29.449]  Who or what was responsible, we never were sure of.
[00:39:29.449 --> 00:39:31.972]  We never were sure or positively found out.
[00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:45.828]  But to be specific, and correct me if I'm wrong, because I was just talking to some of the crew while we were shooting separately back in Los Angeles, they said that multiple cameras and audio and on the digital recordings, it was even distorting.
[00:39:45.828 --> 00:39:52.971]  I mean, this wasn't just one rig to have separate malfunctions, the same malfunctions.
[00:39:52.971 --> 00:39:55.932]  You're talking about one in a billion, one in a trillion.
[00:39:55.932 --> 00:39:56.933]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[00:39:57.313 --> 00:39:57.814]  I don't know.
[00:39:57.814 --> 00:39:59.335]  I don't know.
[00:39:59.335 --> 00:40:07.941]  But all I can say is that we did run into complications, and what caused them or why, we were never able to ascertain.
[00:40:07.941 --> 00:40:17.007]  But you know, and then later on, all the equipment later worked fine, and we never had any more problem with it the rest of the shoot.
[00:40:17.007 --> 00:40:20.510]  Well, I want to say, clearly on the record, that
[00:40:21.434 --> 00:40:25.457]  From the scientists we've interviewed, HAARP is designed to be a weapon.
[00:40:25.457 --> 00:40:27.038]  It can heat the atmosphere.
[00:40:27.038 --> 00:40:35.804]  It can direct those huge rivers of vapor, of condensation, of water, as weapons.
[00:40:35.804 --> 00:40:42.028]  And the Chinese brag, the Russians brag, you can hire their government-funded companies to control the weather for you.
[00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:55.116]  Weather or nature for war.
[00:40:55.116 --> 00:40:58.858]  And we were one of the people that signed these treaties.
[00:40:58.858 --> 00:41:01.939]  And I think that's an important issue right here.
[00:41:01.939 --> 00:41:12.385]  If we sign treaties that we won't use things, won't use nature to permit war, and then we might very well be violating the very treaties we've signed.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:22.395]  Well that's a great point and you made the point to me privately that, well Alex, why are we signing treaties for weather weapons if they don't exist?
[00:41:22.395 --> 00:41:23.376]  That's true also.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:43.818]  So, you know, and I think people are also going to enjoy, there's another part of HAARP that we haven't mentioned today that will be the most terrifying of anything we've talked about, and I'm going to leave that up in the air, because HAARP is going to be, to my knowledge, the first episode December 2nd, again,
[00:41:44.558 --> 00:41:48.122]  I know what it is, but I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
[00:42:06.578 --> 00:42:08.359]  Well, I did a gentleman's bet with my crew and cast, basically.
[00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:12.421]  I said, I bet you, no money involved, just a gentleman's bet, that we will complete all of these.
[00:42:12.421 --> 00:42:13.261]  We will do all seven episodes.
[00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:44.153]  Uh, and we'll finish the ball, but I said I still don't believe they will see the light of day that they will be aired.
[00:42:44.153 --> 00:42:51.195]  And so far I'm losing the gentleman's bet, but there's still about three weeks to go and I hope that I do lose it.
[00:42:51.195 --> 00:42:59.418]  I do not want, and I'm a competitive person, I do not like to lose anything, but I'm hoping that I lose this bet.
[00:42:59.418 --> 00:43:00.838]  I don't want to win this bet.
[00:43:02.722 --> 00:43:09.247]  Well, I hope that you do lose the bet as well, because I've been involved in a few TV productions.
[00:43:09.247 --> 00:43:19.475]  One of them... Seriously, Alex, if it doesn't see the light of day, this show, that we've completed, then I need to come back on your show and we need to ask why.
[00:43:19.475 --> 00:43:25.839]  We need to, at that point, start addressing, I believe, the First Amendment.
[00:43:25.839 --> 00:43:26.480]  I agree with you.
[00:43:27.341 --> 00:43:32.646]  Well, I don't see how they're going to air something that's more than fair from our perspective.
[00:43:32.646 --> 00:43:39.712]  And from what I've seen, and I know you're an honorable person, this is an extremely fair leaning towards our perspective.
[00:43:39.712 --> 00:43:44.677]  Because as you said, you couldn't get the other side to come out and debate.
[00:43:44.677 --> 00:43:46.198]  There's nothing but stonewalling.
[00:43:47.981 --> 00:43:51.262]  But we couldn't even get them to come out and make a comment.
[00:43:51.262 --> 00:43:54.783]  The government wouldn't talk to us, plain and simple.
[00:43:54.783 --> 00:43:56.564]  They wouldn't talk on HAARP.
[00:43:56.564 --> 00:43:58.685]  They wouldn't talk on 9-11.
[00:43:58.685 --> 00:44:08.128]  They wouldn't talk on anything that involved the government and their involvement in any type of conspiracy or whatever the conspiracy is.
[00:44:08.128 --> 00:44:12.789]  You cannot get anyone from government to participate or talk in any manner.
[00:44:12.789 --> 00:44:14.230]  It's that simple.
[00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.171]  And people need to understand, that's the scary thing.
[00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:25.493]  Overwhelmingly scary thing about doing this whole show is the fact that government doesn't have to cooperate.
[00:44:25.493 --> 00:44:28.434]  They act like we work for them.
[00:44:28.434 --> 00:44:32.155]  And I believe they've forgotten something and we've forgotten something.
[00:44:32.155 --> 00:44:33.896]  They work for us.
[00:44:33.896 --> 00:44:35.917]  That's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:44:35.917 --> 00:44:39.318]  But in this country, I believe those roles have switched now.
[00:44:39.318 --> 00:44:43.819]  And the government views us working for them rather than the way it's supposed to be.
[00:44:46.112 --> 00:44:53.997]  Well, that's just an incredible point that things really are backwards now in this nation, in this country.
[00:44:53.997 --> 00:45:03.862]  And if they do allow this to go on television, which it looks like it's going to happen, is that that the system is so arrogant that they don't even care if we know the truth now?
[00:45:03.862 --> 00:45:15.229]  I'm seeing George Soros and Al Gore and Ban Ki-moon of the UN openly say we're going under world government, openly saying it's a new world order, openly stating it's about population reduction.
[00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:24.522]  One child policy, LA Times reports there's going to be a tax on owning a dog or cat because they eat meat, which has a carbon footprint.
[00:45:24.522 --> 00:45:27.423]  You've got the global warming episode, we're going to talk about that.
[00:45:27.423 --> 00:45:29.123]  I mean, they're really coming out in the open.
[00:45:29.123 --> 00:45:35.344]  So is it that they don't have total control of the media, and so you're getting through the chink in the armor?
[00:45:35.344 --> 00:45:41.305]  Or is it they're so arrogant now, they don't care if Governor Ventura goes out and tells you how screwed you are?
[00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:45.166]  They might even sit back and, you know, roast some marshmallows and laugh at us.
[00:45:45.566 --> 00:45:46.867]  I don't know, Alex.
[00:45:46.867 --> 00:45:52.589]  I'm not in contact with any of these quote-unquote people, so I have no idea.
[00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:56.370]  Oh, by the way, global warming is the last one that I list.
[00:45:58.862 --> 00:46:05.625]  Yeah, we were both here trying to remember all seven episodes and finally it came to me, so I thought I'd shout it out.
[00:46:05.625 --> 00:46:09.286]  No, no, I know it makes your head spin, especially when you're really into the minutia.
[00:46:27.354 --> 00:46:33.648]  Let's get into 2012, then we'll get into secret societies, Manchurian candidate, big brother in global warming.
[00:46:33.648 --> 00:46:36.715]  2012, obviously, three days from now.
[00:46:37.674 --> 00:46:45.696]  On Friday, the huge movie is coming out where Woody Harrelson kind of plays the conspiracy theory type.
[00:46:45.696 --> 00:46:47.877]  I know Harrelson, so we're trying to get him on the show.
[00:46:47.877 --> 00:46:49.377]  In fact, that may happen.
[00:46:49.377 --> 00:46:56.079]  But what's your whole take on the real 2012 and the serious, in-depth research you did?
[00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:58.360]  And then separately in the show, I know you get into
[00:46:59.201 --> 00:47:05.205]  Well, it is, and let me just put it this way, and again, I'm not going to go in and make it so people won't watch by telling everything that happens.
[00:47:22.695 --> 00:47:27.298]  Uh, it goes far beyond, let me say this, the Mayan calendar.
[00:47:27.298 --> 00:47:37.243]  Now, the Mayans were very intelligent people way ahead of their time when it came to understanding the planets and the solar system and the heavens.
[00:47:37.243 --> 00:47:40.004]  They truly were, because I've learned this.
[00:47:40.004 --> 00:47:45.407]  Even with all of our modern technology today, the Mayans are right on.
[00:47:45.407 --> 00:47:48.409]  Our technology, for the most part, cannot prove them wrong.
[00:47:50.029 --> 00:47:51.771]  Under most things.
[00:47:51.771 --> 00:48:00.619]  So here you had a culture that took place many, many, many years ago that was very, very bright when it came to space.
[00:48:00.619 --> 00:48:05.803]  And this 2012 show goes beyond the Mayan calendar.
[00:48:05.803 --> 00:48:12.029]  It goes to some things that we know are actually real and completely backed up by NASA.
[00:48:12.609 --> 00:48:22.495]  And that's where I'll leave it, right there, because I want people intrigued, I want them to watch the show, and the show will be on long before 2012 arrives.
[00:48:22.495 --> 00:48:26.557]  Are you, knowing what you now know, doing the deep research, are you concerned about 2012?
[00:48:26.557 --> 00:48:34.982]  I'm concerned, yeah, I'm concerned over the things that I have learned, yes, I'm very concerned over them.
[00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:36.806]  We're good to go.
[00:48:50.425 --> 00:48:52.186]  Absolutely, that'd be a great radio interview.
[00:48:52.186 --> 00:48:54.708]  And also talk about how much hit the cutting room floor.
[00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:56.469]  You guys have done a ton of work.
[00:48:56.469 --> 00:48:58.351]  I mean, they've been working your butt off.
[00:48:58.351 --> 00:48:59.331]  Oh, week in, week out.
[00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:06.316]  Yeah, I've been... Here, I'm trying to... You know how it works in the country, Alex, when you try to retire and quit?
[00:49:06.316 --> 00:49:08.218]  That's when your agent finds your jobs.
[00:49:10.148 --> 00:49:13.810]  But when you're looking for the jobs for 20 years, they can't find you anything.
[00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:19.452]  No, I've been to LA so many times I can't remember since summer.
[00:49:19.452 --> 00:49:20.892]  I've been to Anchorage, Alaska.
[00:49:20.892 --> 00:49:22.433]  I've been to San Francisco.
[00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:27.955]  I've been to Oklahoma City, Kansas City, New York multiple, multiple times.
[00:49:27.955 --> 00:49:32.216]  And I've lost track of a few of the other places that I've been to.
[00:49:32.216 --> 00:49:36.478]  But the most unique was the thing going up to Anchorage to learn about harp.
[00:49:38.038 --> 00:49:41.220]  Absolutely, and again, I'm Huggy Bear.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:47.864]  Let me interject, Alex, of which I, up until about four months ago, I didn't even know what harp was.
[00:49:47.864 --> 00:49:51.326]  Didn't even know what it was.
[00:49:51.326 --> 00:49:52.787]  This has been quite a journey for you.
[00:49:52.787 --> 00:50:06.836]  I know your son began to really get you into this five, six years ago, and obviously I gave you some films, and that helped you along your journey, and then you described it to me at the hotel that now it's like the top of your head's blown off, the whole world's opening up, and
[00:50:07.576 --> 00:50:09.558]  It's quite a journey, isn't it, Governor?
[00:50:09.558 --> 00:50:15.882]  Well, it sure is, and the exciting thing that I'll tell people when people say to me, why do I like to study this?
[00:50:15.882 --> 00:50:17.623]  Why do I like to look at it?
[00:50:17.623 --> 00:50:21.625]  Because these are things that very well could be real.
[00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:30.511]  And when you read a writer like, say, Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn, they're marvelous books, but they're simply figments of their imagination.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.943]  They're carrying you through on their imaginary trip.
[00:50:35.943 --> 00:50:49.473]  I would rather look into and read about real history and hopefully get educated on it so that we're not stupid enough to allow ourselves to repeat it, which over and over I see it happening.
[00:50:49.473 --> 00:50:52.615]  Our stupidity is just unbelievable how we can be duped.
[00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:55.032]  Over and over again.
[00:50:55.032 --> 00:50:55.673]  Absolutely.
[00:50:55.673 --> 00:50:59.656]  I mean really a conspiracy theorist is someone with an alternative history view.
[00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.237]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:16.539 --> 00:51:16.780]  We're good.
[00:51:35.882 --> 00:51:36.262]  We're good.
[00:52:02.063 --> 00:52:06.066]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.066 --> 00:52:09.328]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.328 --> 00:52:10.749]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.143]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.143 --> 00:52:20.528]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.528 --> 00:52:26.073]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.073 --> 00:52:35.702]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.822 --> 00:52:38.163]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.163 --> 00:52:39.743]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.743 --> 00:52:42.204]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.204 --> 00:52:44.325]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.325 --> 00:52:49.487]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.487 --> 00:52:58.590]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.566 --> 00:53:01.747]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:53:01.747 --> 00:53:04.790]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.452]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:53:07.452 --> 00:53:10.635]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[00:53:10.635 --> 00:53:14.919]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[00:53:14.919 --> 00:53:19.403]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[00:53:19.403 --> 00:53:23.026]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[00:53:23.026 --> 00:53:23.747]  Prepare now!
[00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:29.209]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[00:53:29.209 --> 00:53:34.711]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:39.492]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:53:39.492 --> 00:53:41.693]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:07.392]  Big Jesse Ventura is our guest!
[00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:35.816]  Governor, one more time for people tuning in and getting this exclusive first look at the TV show that, believe me, is going to be powerful, folks.
[00:54:35.816 --> 00:54:41.980]  Tell them when the seven episodes are going to air, how they tune in, how they watch it.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:45.962]  Well, it'll be on the True Network, which used to be Court Television.
[00:54:45.962 --> 00:54:51.725]  It's located, if you've got the satellite, I think it's right in between TBS and TNT.
[00:54:52.936 --> 00:54:58.084]  It's the station in between if you're on the direct dish satellite or whatever it is.
[00:54:58.084 --> 00:54:59.586]  But, you know, check wherever.
[00:54:59.586 --> 00:55:06.697]  And anyway, the first show will air Wednesday, December 2nd, and it'll be 10 o'clock Eastern, 9 o'clock Central.
[00:55:07.754 --> 00:55:17.816]  And it's a one-hour show, we're doing seven conspiracies, and naturally I'd like to say this, can we get completely into the conspiracies and everything about them?
[00:55:17.816 --> 00:55:18.776]  Absolutely not.
[00:55:18.776 --> 00:55:21.037]  You can never do that in an hour.
[00:55:21.037 --> 00:55:31.319]  So we focus on just certain portions of the conspiracy, which I think people will find it, especially your listening audience, Alex, are going to find it very interesting.
[00:55:32.122 --> 00:55:39.165]  And so it's going to be airing every Wednesday in December and January, or are they going to skip one on Christmas?
[00:55:39.165 --> 00:55:40.706]  I have no idea.
[00:55:40.706 --> 00:55:47.989]  I'll be gone surfing at that time, and I'll leave all of you up here to take the repercussions from it.
[00:55:47.989 --> 00:55:53.011]  What are you going to do if I come parachuting in when you're out there surfing?
[00:55:53.011 --> 00:56:01.014]  Well, then I'll know everything, hit the fan up here, because I know that if you're not doing your daily radio show, then the United States don't exist anymore.
[00:56:02.088 --> 00:56:04.369]  Now is my bunker ready next to your bungalow?
[00:56:04.369 --> 00:56:07.490]  I don't know.
[00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:18.593]  I'll tell you that Bob, my neighbor Fernando, he had to dig a 40 foot well down there and it took him six months, but it would have taken him a year had there been good waves.
[00:56:20.712 --> 00:56:22.813]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:56:22.813 --> 00:56:27.296]  Okay, we're going to come back and take phone calls, but right now, let's get into the global warming episode.
[00:56:27.296 --> 00:56:27.716]  Okay.
[00:56:27.716 --> 00:56:29.917]  I mean, just give us a little taste of that.
[00:56:29.917 --> 00:56:35.020]  Well, the big thing on global warming to me is this cap-and-trade legislation.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.882]  It's nothing but bait-and-switch.
[00:56:37.882 --> 00:56:42.385]  It's a legislation that's designed to make money, not solve the problem.
[00:56:43.045 --> 00:56:53.134]  And if global warming is indeed a problem, then why is the solution simply money-making that does nothing to address the actual problem?
[00:56:53.134 --> 00:56:59.499]  And that's the key of what we try to expose, and this is the cap-and-trade legislation for what it is.
[00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:10.228]  And the fact that there are 30,000 people with PhDs and science degrees that simply are not buying into global warming, and it doesn't seem to be that they get any type of
[00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:14.092]  Their opinion is not being aired at all.
[00:57:14.092 --> 00:57:14.652]  That's right.
[00:57:14.652 --> 00:57:16.594]  It's a very one-sided opinion.
[00:57:16.594 --> 00:57:28.605]  Well, yeah, when Al Gore says, all scientists agree it's man-made, and then you find out that actually the majority say it's driven by the sun and by nuclei from space causing cloud condensation.
[00:57:28.605 --> 00:57:33.549]  I mean, I'm not going to give away who you interview in the film, but this is going to be a powerful death blow.
[00:57:35.234 --> 00:57:38.317]  One more nail in the coffin against the Greenies that want to tax us.
[00:57:38.317 --> 00:57:42.521]  I mean, it's come out that Al Gore has made over a billion bucks so far off this.
[00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:47.825]  I mean, he owns a cap-and-trade company that you've got to buy carbon credits from.
[00:57:47.825 --> 00:57:49.327]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[00:57:49.327 --> 00:57:53.270]  Well, again, it comes down to the legislature.
[00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:58.315]  I'm not a scientist, Alex, so I'm not gonna beat my head against the wall on whether it's real or not.
[00:57:59.248 --> 00:58:07.010]  A good way to look at things is always view something not from what someone says, but from what someone does.
[00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:14.371]  And the cap-and-trade legislation is fraudulent because you can have a company that's supposedly polluting.
[00:58:14.371 --> 00:58:16.472]  They don't have to change at all.
[00:58:16.472 --> 00:58:27.194]  They can simply pay money and buy other people's and trade so that until they get under, and they'll still pollute the same, but then they'll be able to say that they're not.
[00:58:27.794 --> 00:58:29.956]  Well, that right away is fraudulent.
[00:58:29.956 --> 00:58:33.438]  And if that's fraudulent, then what else is fraudulent?
[00:58:33.438 --> 00:58:34.799]  I tell you, that's a key point.
[00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:37.881]  Take the weakest part of their argument, break their neck right there.
[00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.082]  That's why we love you, Governor.
[00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:40.823]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.823 --> 00:58:45.787]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:50.468 --> 00:58:55.030]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:59.353]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.353 --> 00:59:04.757]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.097 --> 00:59:05.838]  It's true.
[00:59:05.838 --> 00:59:11.542]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:11.542 --> 00:59:15.125]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:19.849]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:22.611]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:25.954]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.274 --> 00:59:31.217]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.217 --> 00:59:36.259]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.259 --> 00:59:40.441]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.441 --> 00:59:42.222]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.222 --> 00:59:46.824]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:53.596 --> 00:59:55.998]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.998 --> 01:00:05.204]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.204 --> 01:00:06.505]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.505 --> 01:00:08.286]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:10.047]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.047 --> 01:00:11.628]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.628 --> 01:00:13.189]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:17.372]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.372 --> 01:00:21.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:31.314]  All right, in this five minutes, we're going to get into Secret Societies, Manchurian Candidate, and Big Brother.
[01:00:31.314 --> 01:00:37.696]  The three episodes we haven't given you a little teaser on.
[01:00:37.696 --> 01:00:41.798]  It premieres December 2nd, True TV.
[01:00:41.798 --> 01:00:48.781]  Tell everybody about it, folks, because I think this is going to be the, not just fairest, but leaning towards our view of any television show ever on mainstream TV.
[01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:52.203]  I think this is a bellwether because the establishment's beginning to realize that
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.061]  Well, I guess let's go Manchurian Candidate.
[01:00:56.061 --> 01:00:58.803]  This one is going to be a very, this one is a very terrifying show.
[01:01:17.985 --> 01:01:20.828]  We all know that MKUltra was real.
[01:01:20.828 --> 01:01:22.529]  The documents state so.
[01:01:22.529 --> 01:01:40.102]  So there's no gray area there that the government was in the business back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s of attempting to control people's minds and attempting to manipulate them and to use them to their advantage both militarily and whatever.
[01:01:40.102 --> 01:01:45.867]  Well, all indications are that those programs have been re-ramped up again and they're back on a high level again.
[01:01:47.006 --> 01:01:54.949]  And that being said, that's what the Manchurian candidate deals with, of course, and that we've all heard the story.
[01:01:54.949 --> 01:02:02.932]  One of the interesting things I'll say is that the guy who shot John Lennon fits it perfectly, Mark David Chapman.
[01:02:02.932 --> 01:02:08.915]  Because contrary to popular belief, Chapman was no Beatles fanatic.
[01:02:08.915 --> 01:02:14.197]  If you go back in his history, in fact, his favorite artist was Todd Rundgren, who's hardly a Beatle.
[01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:20.865]  And when he shot Lennon, he had three ways to escape immediately.
[01:02:20.865 --> 01:02:25.426]  Central Park, down into the subways, and then just get lost with everybody.
[01:02:25.426 --> 01:02:30.808]  Instead, he stepped back in the shadows and started reading the book, The Catcher in the Rye.
[01:02:30.808 --> 01:02:33.389]  Which is a classic mind control.
[01:02:33.389 --> 01:02:38.671]  When they tortured them under the drugs in one of the systems, they then become obsessed with the trigger word.
[01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:42.632]  When McVeigh got pulled over, he said, get the chip out of me, and was foaming at the mouth.
[01:02:43.248 --> 01:02:51.435]  And then the most famous mind control scientist ever, Jolion West, was his doctor with him every day until the day he was executed.
[01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:59.001]  And I'll tell you this, Governor, studying the Fort Hood shooting, I can't say it was a mind control, but it has every earmark.
[01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:00.522]  He's a psychiatrist.
[01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:10.090]  The FBI and CIA were- Well, I'll tell you, it's funny you should say that, Alex, because amazingly, when it first happened, scarily, that's the first thing that popped into my head.
[01:03:11.212 --> 01:03:20.357]  Unbelievable that you say that, because that's the exact first thing that popped into my head when I first heard about the Fort Hood shootings.
[01:03:20.357 --> 01:03:25.900]  And when I started then reading about the whole situation, how the guy never had it in his background.
[01:03:27.757 --> 01:03:36.105]  And then now the CIA and FBI are watching him and he has this fake history that suddenly began and then commanders and people said bust him and they wouldn't do it.
[01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.005]  Same thing with 9-11.
[01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:38.907]  Then he's a psychiatrist.
[01:03:38.907 --> 01:03:40.969]  He has that whole history.
[01:03:40.969 --> 01:03:44.072]  Once you've studied mind control, he just fits.
[01:03:44.072 --> 01:03:45.773]  Every piece fits.
[01:03:45.773 --> 01:03:47.194]  And I wouldn't say this last week.
[01:03:47.194 --> 01:03:48.876]  I mean, I knew that was going on Thursday.
[01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:54.301]  But now, more and more of the pieces are coming out and man, the hair on the back of my neck just stands up.
[01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:58.934]  Anyway, enough Manchurian, what are the last two shows?
[01:03:58.934 --> 01:03:59.735]  Thank you, it's Big Brother watching.
[01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:18.748]  What about it?
[01:04:18.748 --> 01:04:20.449]  Well, no, just how folks can get it.
[01:04:20.449 --> 01:04:21.410]  It's been a best-seller.
[01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:22.290]  Oh, no, I don't know.
[01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.933]  It's still in the bookstores, and I guess you can get it over the internet.
[01:04:25.933 --> 01:04:30.375]  I've been so involved in this thing, I haven't even thought about the book for months.
[01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:32.757]  Well, I just wanted to plug your book, because it's a good book.
[01:04:32.757 --> 01:04:33.678]  Oh, thank you.
[01:04:33.678 --> 01:04:34.838]  And it's still out there.
[01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:38.941]  I was actually in the Minneapolis airport the other day, and I saw copies there for sale.
[01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:43.624]  So, it's a book that's got a lot of my heart and soul in it.
[01:04:43.624 --> 01:04:46.566]  I wrote it on my trips to Mexico and all that.
[01:04:47.266 --> 01:04:53.350]  And it includes my wife, and it tells you about my years in office, and it'll give you a great insight into how I think.
[01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:54.011]  Absolutely.
[01:04:54.011 --> 01:04:59.194]  Okay, the two final episodes briefly, and your phone calls for Governor Jesse Ventura, giving us the exclusive.
[01:04:59.194 --> 01:05:00.755]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.755 --> 01:05:08.500]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.843]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks.
[01:05:13.183 --> 01:05:14.565]  Or the book for 10 bucks.
[01:05:14.565 --> 01:05:17.528]  And we have an audiobook on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:05:17.528 --> 01:05:23.816]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:05:23.816 --> 01:05:25.398]  This book will work for anyone.
[01:05:25.398 --> 01:05:27.880]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.224]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy.
[01:05:31.224 --> 01:05:33.247]  And it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:05:33.487 --> 01:05:35.567]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:05:35.567 --> 01:05:37.328]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:05:37.328 --> 01:05:39.848]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:44.569]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:48.290]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:51.411]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:51.411 --> 01:05:53.291]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:55.412]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.634]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.634 --> 01:06:08.878]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.878 --> 01:06:13.683]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.683 --> 01:06:20.090]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:22.333]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:24.473]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.473 --> 01:06:25.614]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.854]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.758 --> 01:06:49.024]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.024 --> 01:06:58.152]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:00.185 --> 01:07:09.330]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:12.712]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.712 --> 01:07:18.575]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.575 --> 01:07:23.358]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:23.358 --> 01:07:25.699]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:25.979 --> 01:07:35.164]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:07:35.164 --> 01:07:40.727]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:42.548]  Help others and earn extra income!
[01:07:42.588 --> 01:07:46.450]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:48.451]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.371 --> 01:08:27.612]  Governor Jesse Ventura, he's worn a lot of hats, but now he is fighting the New World Order.
[01:08:28.294 --> 01:08:34.235]  And I don't want to put words in his mouth, but, Governor, I think it's safe to say, I mean, you now know there's a world government, there is an elite.
[01:08:34.235 --> 01:08:36.716]  The question is, how evil are they?
[01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:37.896]  Are they monolithic?
[01:08:37.896 --> 01:08:38.937]  What is their main goal?
[01:08:38.937 --> 01:08:48.919]  I mean, is it fair to say that you're now officially, uh, not their label of conspiracy terrorist, but, I mean, you question JFK, you question 9-11, you question HAARP.
[01:08:48.919 --> 01:08:51.580]  You're not buying the Kool-Aid they're selling.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.280]  Is that fair to say?
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.503]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:08:55.503 --> 01:08:59.788]  Irregardless of anything, it sure is interesting stuff.
[01:08:59.788 --> 01:09:06.335]  And, you know, we do a show on the Bilderbergs and I do understand that they're real.
[01:09:06.335 --> 01:09:11.802]  I guess the thing that upsets me the most was I made it to governor and they never invited me.
[01:09:13.562 --> 01:09:22.204]  And I would, and I guess maybe I gotta run for office again then so I can get invited to this thing to find out what the hell goes on inside there.
[01:09:22.204 --> 01:09:29.545]  Well, they would have invited you if you would have gone along with the CIA when they sent you down at the governor's office two weeks into office.
[01:09:29.545 --> 01:09:31.846]  But I mean, you're not selling people out.
[01:09:31.846 --> 01:09:34.667]  You're a swashbuckling, you know, loose cannon for freedom.
[01:09:36.934 --> 01:09:38.835]  Well, I mean, what is your view on the New World Order then?
[01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:42.095]  Because I know you're anti-establishment and... Well, let me put it to you this way.
[01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:45.857]  Then I also look at it from a different perspective, Alex.
[01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:47.957]  I believe in evolution.
[01:09:47.957 --> 01:09:49.918]  The science of evolution.
[01:09:49.918 --> 01:09:54.159]  And maybe this is evolution.
[01:09:54.159 --> 01:10:01.201]  You know, when you look at it, that we will evolve and that maybe it won't fully be here in our lifetimes, but a hundred years from now,
[01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:09.630]  Because of the fact with technology the way it is, the world gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
[01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:17.556]  And I guess, let me, just for the sake of argument, state that there would be one good thing if there was a one world government.
[01:10:17.556 --> 01:10:18.497]  You know what that would be?
[01:10:18.497 --> 01:10:21.019]  There couldn't be wars then, could there?
[01:10:23.621 --> 01:10:30.765]  But see, Governor, that is the... I mean, literally, if... then you wouldn't have one country fighting another country.
[01:10:30.765 --> 01:10:32.266]  No, but that's not their plan.
[01:10:32.266 --> 01:10:33.867]  Oh, I understand that, Alex.
[01:10:33.867 --> 01:10:36.408]  Don't for a minute think I'm naive.
[01:10:36.408 --> 01:10:49.476]  But I am saying that there is the chance that this could be almost an evolutionary thing, that we will evolve to the point where there may well be a one-world government and there may be no way around it.
[01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:54.284]  Well, Jesse, the important thing, Alex, is what will that government be?
[01:10:55.222 --> 01:11:15.546]  Well, that's the issue here, is that they always pitch it that we were hunter-gatherers, we were agrarian, we formed villages, then city-states, then nations, then empires, and the next phase is Star Trek, that we've been implanted with psychologically, the image of the global galactic empire, and we're always fighting green aliens, you know, the Klingons, so we've got to do this.
[01:11:15.546 --> 01:11:22.467]  The issue is, they built this world government in stealth, and denied that it existed.
[01:11:23.207 --> 01:11:25.688]  Until it was too late to really stop it.
[01:11:25.688 --> 01:11:28.850]  And now they're coming out going, yeah, we're going to tax everything you do.
[01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:31.151]  We're not going to let you have more than one kid.
[01:11:31.151 --> 01:11:35.093]  And yeah, we want to carry out eugenics on you, and we're going to carbon tax you.
[01:11:35.093 --> 01:11:44.177]  And Ban Ki-moon writes editorials saying the carbon tax is for the New World Order, and it's for a bunch of corrupt CEOs and bankers to play emperor.
[01:11:44.177 --> 01:11:52.561]  And so if the people of the world ever wanted to create a world government, and it was democratic and under the republic system, then that would be one thing.
[01:11:53.141 --> 01:11:58.645]  But this thing was created by a corrupt group of criminals and it's a world tyranny.
[01:11:58.645 --> 01:12:10.194]  That's why every ounce of my body and being, just like Thomas Jefferson said, I swear eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.
[01:12:10.194 --> 01:12:13.577]  And Jesse, I know you, I mean, don't you swear?
[01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:16.219]  Alex, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
[01:12:16.219 --> 01:12:19.581]  I'm not going to dispute anything you've said.
[01:12:19.581 --> 01:12:20.622]  I won't.
[01:12:20.622 --> 01:12:21.423]  But the point is,
[01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:23.609]  And you're correct.
[01:12:23.609 --> 01:12:26.330]  If it was so good, why would they do it in secret?
[01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:29.892]  And that's a very, very valid point to make.
[01:12:29.892 --> 01:12:42.998]  But the point we have to make, if it's inevitable that we're going to come under one world rule, then we, the people, have to ensure that we're players in the game, that we have dogs in the fight.
[01:12:42.998 --> 01:12:45.359]  But I don't want to be under the Communist Chinese.
[01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:48.120]  Alex is making sure we got a dog in the fight.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.501]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:51.862]  But instead, so we never have a dog in the fight,
[01:12:52.614 --> 01:12:55.817]  They just say there isn't a world government, meet your world government.
[01:12:55.817 --> 01:13:01.282]  I mean, they're still saying world government doesn't exist, so that we can never demand representation.
[01:13:01.282 --> 01:13:05.866]  Well, what was interesting was I was out at that new Denver airport.
[01:13:05.866 --> 01:13:06.146]  Right?
[01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:07.568]  The new one in Denver?
[01:13:07.568 --> 01:13:08.048]  Yes.
[01:13:08.048 --> 01:13:16.496]  And on the plaque that they have out there, on the bottom of it, it says the New World Airport Commission.
[01:13:16.496 --> 01:13:17.117]  And there isn't one.
[01:13:19.105 --> 01:13:22.527]  Nothing of that name is in existence.
[01:13:22.527 --> 01:13:24.268]  And there's murals of Nazis.
[01:13:24.268 --> 01:13:28.710]  How would they put that on the dedication plaque at that big Denver airport?
[01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:29.951]  The New World.
[01:13:29.951 --> 01:13:37.675]  Not the Colorado Airport Commission, not the Denver Airport Commission, but the New World Airport Commission.
[01:13:37.675 --> 01:13:41.337]  And they have paintings of Nazis killing children above it.
[01:13:41.337 --> 01:13:43.998]  Also, they're not Nazis.
[01:13:43.998 --> 01:13:44.999]  I disprove that.
[01:13:46.604 --> 01:13:49.127]  Well, there's people in fascist-style uniforms milling people in.
[01:13:49.127 --> 01:13:50.489]  Right, but they are not Nazis.
[01:13:50.489 --> 01:13:52.792]  You know how I disproved that, Alex?
[01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:53.593]  How?
[01:13:53.593 --> 01:13:55.315]  The guy's carrying an AK-47.
[01:13:55.315 --> 01:13:56.977]  I saw it right away.
[01:13:56.977 --> 01:13:58.459]  I said, this can't be a Nazi.
[01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:00.381]  The Nazis didn't have that weapon.
[01:14:00.381 --> 01:14:05.007]  Yeah, but I don't think the artist knows that the Kalashnikov is an Eastern Bloc weapon.
[01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:05.568]  Well, I noticed it.
[01:14:07.885 --> 01:14:14.930]  Hey, Jesse, I want to take some calls in time, but a plug right here in the middle of this conversation.
[01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:25.877]  I'm going to mail you, I've forgotten to mail you, Fall of the Republic, because this details from the globalist-owned statements that they are setting up a tyrannical world government, that they engineered the banking crisis by
[01:14:26.577 --> 01:14:34.023]  And Alex, let me shamelessly add in, please watch my television show because if we get such an overwhelming audience response, it'll force them to buy it up for another deal.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.182]  And we'll be able to get that much farther into it then.
[01:14:58.182 --> 01:14:58.862]  There you go!
[01:15:07.381 --> 01:15:20.524]  Look, this show is important, and I want everybody to tell their friends and family and neighbors, True TV, December 2nd, airing every Wednesday, absolutely important because this show is definitely from our perspective.
[01:15:20.524 --> 01:15:23.345]  Okay, I want to go to some calls, but we got to finish up with the last point.
[01:15:23.345 --> 01:15:26.546]  We just hit Manchurian Candidate, Secret Societies.
[01:15:26.546 --> 01:15:27.486]  What about Big Brother?
[01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:32.189]  Well, Big Brother is just simply that.
[01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:34.492]  It's Big Brother, are they watching over you?
[01:15:34.492 --> 01:15:45.402]  And I think in our show, you're going to hear clearly that they are, and that clearly it's going to come from a place where the government is able to do it and work around the Constitution.
[01:15:51.263 --> 01:16:05.269]  We have found that out and we will air that on the show to where you will clearly see how the government has looped the Constitution in which establishing Big Brother on you.
[01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:08.170]  Can we say the different federal groups you talk to or just leave that alone?
[01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:11.819]  Uh, I don't think I talked to any federal groups again.
[01:16:11.819 --> 01:16:14.081]  There was no cooperation from the government at all.
[01:16:14.081 --> 01:16:15.522]  Well, you talked to their minions, though.
[01:16:15.522 --> 01:16:20.406]  You talked to their Gestapo, their, their, their, their ground pounders, their citizen spies.
[01:16:20.406 --> 01:16:22.948]  Well, yes, we did do that.
[01:16:22.948 --> 01:16:24.169]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:25.010]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:27.072]  Yeah, just leave it at that.
[01:16:27.072 --> 01:16:31.275]  Well, it's a very exciting, uh... Too many of them are right down in your country, Alex.
[01:16:31.275 --> 01:16:32.496]  I don't want you getting in trouble.
[01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:36.567]  Believe me, we know what InfraGard is up to.
[01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:42.353]  Oklahoma's too close to Austin.
[01:16:42.353 --> 01:16:45.516]  Okay, folks, Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:16:45.516 --> 01:16:56.025]  Best-selling author, wrestler, movie star, governor, football, National Football League, NFL commentator, surfer.
[01:16:56.025 --> 01:16:57.767]  Jesse, what is there you haven't done?
[01:17:00.171 --> 01:17:04.453]  I don't know, but I've got a few years to figure it out yet, Alex.
[01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:10.875]  You never stop going, because in the words of the late, great Warren Zavon, I'll sleep when I'm dead.
[01:17:16.946 --> 01:17:18.448]  We're going right to the bottom of the hour, 29 after.
[01:17:18.448 --> 01:17:20.610]  We're going to let the governor go here.
[01:17:20.610 --> 01:17:27.077]  So we're going to take calls right now for the last 12 minutes or so with Governor Jesse Ventura giving you the inside scoop.
[01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:30.321]  Jesse, why did you give this show first the inside scoop?
[01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:33.144]  I was very honored when you called me and said you were going to give us the exclusive.
[01:17:33.144 --> 01:17:33.244]  Why?
[01:17:33.404 --> 01:17:35.125]  Well, for a number of reasons, Alex.
[01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:40.490]  Your participation in the show was exceptional and we appreciated it.
[01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.951]  You know, you flew out to L.A.
[01:17:41.951 --> 01:17:46.175]  a couple times and all that to participate, and so why not?
[01:17:46.175 --> 01:17:51.279]  I reward the people that reward me, and so that's a reason for it.
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:57.127]  You have the listening audience, the base market that this show is designed for.
[01:17:57.127 --> 01:18:05.137]  I would be crazy not to come on your show with my show because, you know, I'm not going to lie, we're out for success on this show.
[01:18:05.137 --> 01:18:06.719]  I hope this show is hugely successful.
[01:18:07.439 --> 01:18:09.901]  Yeah, but I know the TV shows you turn down.
[01:18:09.901 --> 01:18:16.805]  I mean, I don't know if you want to say it, but you're turning down something with 30 million viewers coming up in a few weeks because you want to be out of the country.
[01:18:16.805 --> 01:18:23.429]  I'm just really honored you came because I know you're turning down a bunch of really huge media interviews, but doing our shows, we appreciate it.
[01:18:23.429 --> 01:18:24.550]  Well, no problem.
[01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:31.934]  And like I said, you know, you're a wealth of information, Alex, that we can always rely upon.
[01:18:31.934 --> 01:18:36.597]  And, you know, so doing your show is just simply the left hand washing the right hand.
[01:18:37.526 --> 01:18:40.689]  Well, folks, we're going to post this interview up at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:42.911]  Over 200,000 people a day get the free podcast.
[01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:44.172]  Get it, share it with everybody.
[01:18:44.172 --> 01:18:55.222]  We're going to post a YouTube video of it, share it with everyone, because if this show can be a big success, the system may start letting more of this on the air as the Internet culture takes over the mainstream media.
[01:18:55.222 --> 01:18:57.244]  We can beat the globalists.
[01:18:57.244 --> 01:19:02.069]  If they can't beat us, they're going to try to join us, and we can slow down this whole system.
[01:19:02.589 --> 01:19:03.910]  That's what Tweety Bird always said.
[01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:06.092]  If you can't beat them, join them.
[01:19:06.092 --> 01:19:09.135]  Well, if we can beat them, they're going to have to back off.
[01:19:09.135 --> 01:19:12.317]  And believing we can expose these people is half the battle.
[01:19:12.317 --> 01:19:13.698]  Believing you can win.
[01:19:13.698 --> 01:19:14.279]  Or as G.I.
[01:19:14.279 --> 01:19:15.780]  Joe says, knowing is half the battle.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.742]  I believe taking action is half the battle.
[01:19:17.742 --> 01:19:19.083]  Resistance is victory.
[01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:21.184]  Matt in Illinois, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:19:21.184 --> 01:19:22.586]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:19:22.586 --> 01:19:23.887]  Hello, Mr. Ventura.
[01:19:23.887 --> 01:19:25.788]  How are you doing?
[01:19:25.788 --> 01:19:26.208]  Pretty good.
[01:19:27.423 --> 01:19:29.464]  I wanted to know, I don't have a TV.
[01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:36.528]  I gave up watching TV a long, long time ago because I didn't like being treated like I was stupid.
[01:19:36.528 --> 01:19:39.370]  And it sounds like you've got a really good show, and I'd like to know
[01:19:40.347 --> 01:19:56.362]  If there's any plans to put it on the web or somehow that I'll be able to watch it without having to... I don't know at this time, but then again, I'm not a good web person to talk to, but I certainly will inquire to find out what the options are about doing it over the web or whatever.
[01:19:56.362 --> 01:19:56.943]  I don't know.
[01:19:56.943 --> 01:20:00.987]  But at this time, the only thing I know is we'll be starting December 2nd.
[01:20:01.448 --> 01:20:02.689]  Yeah, Matt, thanks for the call.
[01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:07.711]  I'll tell you this, Time Warner is putting a lot of their stuff on YouTube now.
[01:20:07.711 --> 01:20:13.895]  Most TV shows are there after the series runs, then it's up there with commercials on YouTube.
[01:20:13.895 --> 01:20:16.036]  I would imagine this is made for the Internet.
[01:20:16.036 --> 01:20:20.098]  I would imagine you're going to be able to see it officially on the Internet after it airs on TV.
[01:20:20.098 --> 01:20:22.159]  Go to a neighbor's house and watch it.
[01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:24.101]  Let's, you know, the Mind Control Box.
[01:20:24.101 --> 01:20:27.062]  We're going to use the Mind Control Box to deprogram people.
[01:20:27.062 --> 01:20:29.764]  Mary Ann in Iowa, you're on the air with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:20:29.764 --> 01:20:30.064]  Go ahead.
[01:20:30.805 --> 01:20:32.346]  Hi, it's a pleasure.
[01:20:32.346 --> 01:20:38.348]  I just want to say I hope this wakes up the American people and I praise you for doing that.
[01:20:38.348 --> 01:20:42.129]  I wanted to answer a quick question and make a quick comment.
[01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:59.615]  Representative Mike Pence from Indiana, Republican, the other day I was watching the health voting on C-SPAN and he said, and I wrote it down because I was freaked out by it, he said, it seems a few elite in a far distant country can run our lives for us.
[01:21:00.117 --> 01:21:03.179]  Hold on, you mean Senator DeMint admitted that foreign bankers run our country?
[01:21:03.179 --> 01:21:03.639]  I mean, that's amazing.
[01:21:03.639 --> 01:21:04.719]  Okay, let's get Jesse's take on that.
[01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:29.213]  Well, there's certainly that possibility.
[01:21:29.213 --> 01:21:36.719]  Yes, we definitely do a show on the Bilderbergers, which I was happily kind of... I knew of them, but I didn't know as much about them.
[01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:39.801]  And here's the interesting little sidebar for it.
[01:21:39.801 --> 01:21:45.625]  We had a... Governor, are you still there?
[01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:49.548]  See, that... I know that sound.
[01:21:49.548 --> 01:21:50.689]  That's us.
[01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:52.030]  That wasn't Ron Paul the other day.
[01:21:53.814 --> 01:21:55.495]  Okay, that's our phone system.
[01:21:55.495 --> 01:21:58.178]  I want that on record.
[01:21:58.178 --> 01:22:03.663]  Tell you, it's like living in a clown house or something.
[01:22:03.663 --> 01:22:08.247]  Just call him back and let him finish his point.
[01:22:08.247 --> 01:22:10.849]  It's always when I got huge guests on too.
[01:22:10.849 --> 01:22:16.934]  Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, and the standard operating procedure.
[01:22:16.934 --> 01:22:18.916]  Hell, I can call him on my cell phone and get him on that way.
[01:22:22.824 --> 01:22:38.867]  We've got General Stubblebine coming up with Dr. Rima Labo, part two of the interview we started last week.
[01:22:38.867 --> 01:22:42.568]  And I do have a lot of other news that we're going to be covering as well.
[01:22:42.568 --> 01:22:51.270]  But hey, it's the miracle of technology, ladies and gentlemen, where 50 years ago, 60, 70, 80 years ago, you couldn't even do stuff like this.
[01:22:56.622 --> 01:23:01.407]  And, uh, that's kind of the hallmark of this show now.
[01:23:01.407 --> 01:23:02.307]  That's what we do.
[01:23:02.307 --> 01:23:04.590]  That's how we do it.
[01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:08.413]  Okay, Governor, I got you cut off there when you were going to add a point about Bilderberg.
[01:23:08.413 --> 01:23:08.873]  Go ahead.
[01:23:08.873 --> 01:23:12.076]  It was either that, Alex, or they're cutting us off now.
[01:23:12.076 --> 01:23:14.639]  They're on to us.
[01:23:14.639 --> 01:23:21.745]  You know, what I was going to add was that, just a simple sidelight to the show, and then I got to run, is that, uh,
[01:23:23.227 --> 01:23:38.855]  We were interviewing a gentleman on the Bilderberg episode, and he had to travel from Europe to do the interview with me in New York, and we had to delay it a day because when he went to the airport, he was on the no-fly list.
[01:23:38.855 --> 01:23:42.337]  Now, this person's not a terrorist.
[01:23:42.337 --> 01:23:45.559]  Why would he be on the no-fly list, and who has the power to do that?
[01:23:48.151 --> 01:23:50.334]  Well that happens to even congressmen now.
[01:23:50.334 --> 01:23:54.421]  They get crosswise and you're not charged.
[01:23:54.421 --> 01:23:56.504]  There's no judge, there's no jury.
[01:23:56.504 --> 01:23:59.348]  And now they're saying if you have bad credit you'll be on the no-fly list.
[01:24:04.309 --> 01:24:08.730]  You get a ticket of a felony or a misdemeanor or a parking ticket, Governor, but then you lose your rights.
[01:24:08.730 --> 01:24:13.491]  Isn't that 180 degrees the opposite from our republic form of government?
[01:24:13.491 --> 01:24:15.232]  I would like to think so.
[01:24:15.232 --> 01:24:20.673]  And, you know, as I said earlier, Alex, it's just the case of, you know, the big brother.
[01:24:20.673 --> 01:24:25.594]  And in this case, it was dealing with the Bilderbergs that we have this particular guy we were going to interview.
[01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:29.035]  And he was coming from a foreign country to here.
[01:24:29.035 --> 01:24:31.196]  And he was on the no-fly list over there.
[01:24:32.856 --> 01:24:46.804]  To my knowledge, he's not a terrorist, so, you know, it's interesting how they'll disrupt people's lives by putting him on this no-fly list if he's simply out of, say, a different political persuasion or whatever it might be.
[01:24:46.804 --> 01:24:52.507]  Well, Governor, you've got to get to a meeting in downtown Minneapolis, so we've only got four more minutes left with you.
[01:24:52.507 --> 01:24:54.368]  Let's take two final calls quickly.
[01:24:54.368 --> 01:24:56.689]  Gary in Washington, then Mark in Minnesota.
[01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:59.030]  Gary, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.931]  Pleasure to be here with you.
[01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:06.494]  I have a very important piece of information for the Governor, and I have a big question for both of you.
[01:25:06.494 --> 01:25:12.179]  First piece of information, ShakeMaps is a product of U.S.
[01:25:12.179 --> 01:25:14.841]  Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program.
[01:25:14.841 --> 01:25:28.372]  If you look at the ShakeMap in Sichuan, when the earthquake happened with a rainbow over China on May 20, 2008, the ShakeMap is the exact same shape as the HAARP weapon.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:32.861]  That's point number one, and then we'll get to point number two.
[01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.101]  Okay, what's your final point?
[01:25:34.101 --> 01:25:36.022]  Because we've got to go here in a minute.
[01:25:36.022 --> 01:25:38.562]  Okay, so check out the ShakeMap's final point.
[01:25:38.562 --> 01:25:41.763]  There's too much fragmentation on the info war.
[01:25:41.763 --> 01:25:47.285]  Prison Planet, Birthers, Oath Keepers, 9-11 Truth, Audit the Fed, LP, Gun Owners, Skywatch.
[01:25:47.285 --> 01:25:48.765]  I would recommend both of you
[01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:56.144]  Sir, we can't do it all.
[01:25:56.144 --> 01:25:56.845]  Hold on a minute.
[01:25:56.845 --> 01:26:01.369]  People act like Jesse Ventura, Alex Jones, or Ron Paul have magical powers.
[01:26:01.369 --> 01:26:04.612]  We put our pants on one leg at a time, too.
[01:26:04.612 --> 01:26:06.073]  Freedom is fractured.
[01:26:06.073 --> 01:26:10.377]  It's good that we're not all unified because that makes us hard to stop.
[01:26:10.377 --> 01:26:11.418]  Governor, your comment on that?
[01:26:11.838 --> 01:26:15.100]  Well, and the other thing is, too, is that how do you do it?
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:25.306]  It's like when I was the third party candidate in Minnesota, I tried to bring all the third parties together so we could consolidate and become a force against the other two parties.
[01:26:25.306 --> 01:26:29.349]  I got news for you, it's like herding cats.
[01:26:29.349 --> 01:26:35.092]  And I couldn't even bring them together on an issue that we all agreed upon, and that was campaign finance.
[01:26:35.092 --> 01:26:37.314]  None of us, none of us took dirty money.
[01:26:38.334 --> 01:26:44.455]  And it just fractured like nothing, and so I just threw my hands up in the air and I said, it may be impossible.
[01:26:44.455 --> 01:26:50.917]  I think Alex makes a great point that they can't stop us all if we're all coming at them from different directions.
[01:26:50.917 --> 01:26:52.557]  Yeah, it's a spirit of liberty.
[01:26:52.557 --> 01:26:54.838]  Shrink government, bring accountability.
[01:26:54.838 --> 01:26:59.319]  Final call for Governor Jesse Ventura from his home state, Minnesota.
[01:26:59.319 --> 01:27:00.159]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:00.559]  Go ahead.
[01:27:00.559 --> 01:27:01.279]  Hi.
[01:27:01.279 --> 01:27:02.580]  You can hear me?
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.060]  Yes, I can.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:03.500]  Go ahead.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.060]  Hi, Mark.
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:04.180]  Hi.
[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:06.212]  Hi, I brought it for you, Jesse.
[01:27:06.212 --> 01:27:07.793]  I appreciate both you guys' work.
[01:27:07.793 --> 01:27:12.338]  And quickly, a couple questions about... I can't wait for your show to come out.
[01:27:12.338 --> 01:27:14.120]  I look forward to watching that.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.582]  And I'll tell people about it, my friends and whatnot.
[01:27:16.582 --> 01:27:17.884]  A couple ideas for the show.
[01:27:17.884 --> 01:27:26.953]  Maybe you could look into the patent issue where people... individuals developing free energy and anti-gravity technology that
[01:27:27.714 --> 01:27:30.755]  The government then deems it a national security risk.
[01:27:30.755 --> 01:27:35.956]  You know, Jesse, that's a great idea if it gets picked up for another season, is look at Cold Fusion.
[01:27:35.956 --> 01:27:39.437]  We'll take that into consideration, but we've got to get picked up first.
[01:27:39.437 --> 01:27:41.318]  We only did seven for right now.
[01:27:41.318 --> 01:27:45.559]  Yeah, we've got to cross that bridge before we... We have to come to that bridge before we cross it.
[01:27:45.559 --> 01:27:47.340]  Anything else, Mark?
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:47.960]  Yeah, one last thing.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:55.002]  I just saw an article in the WorldNet Daily about data centers being set up by the NSA and Homeland Security Department.
[01:27:55.675 --> 01:27:56.696]  And I'm very concerned about that.
[01:27:56.696 --> 01:28:00.637]  They collect all our information, all communications, and store it.
[01:28:00.637 --> 01:28:03.959]  And it's just another incremental loss of liberty.
[01:28:03.959 --> 01:28:13.263]  Watch my show on his big brother watching and all that, and you'll learn how they get away with it, and how they loop the Constitution to do it.
[01:28:13.263 --> 01:28:14.404]  Thank you so much, Mark.
[01:28:14.404 --> 01:28:15.744]  Okay, we've got a minute and a half left.
[01:28:15.744 --> 01:28:18.866]  Governor, I'm going to say bye to you when we go to break, so just hold one moment.
[01:28:18.866 --> 01:28:21.387]  But I wanted to say in closing, it's been great working with you.
[01:28:21.887 --> 01:28:22.988]  I hope the show airs.
[01:28:22.988 --> 01:28:24.289]  Looks like it is.
[01:28:24.289 --> 01:28:25.349]  They've started promoting it.
[01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:26.690]  They're unleashing you to promote it.
[01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:27.851]  So I think that's the green light.
[01:28:27.851 --> 01:28:33.235]  But as you said, we won't believe it airs until we see it go on December 2nd on TruTV.
[01:28:33.235 --> 01:28:34.496]  So spread the word.
[01:28:34.496 --> 01:28:39.019]  But did you ever think, because I know all about this stuff and I still can't believe it.
[01:28:39.019 --> 01:28:40.360]  I'm still flabbergasted.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.141]  I am psychologically speechless a lot of times.
[01:28:43.141 --> 01:28:43.602]  I can still
[01:28:44.282 --> 01:28:47.144]  Babble some words out, but it's hard to articulate.
[01:28:47.144 --> 01:28:49.526]  The NSA says they're taking over the whole internet.
[01:28:49.526 --> 01:28:53.308]  They may shut it down during crises like bird flu or swine flu.
[01:28:53.308 --> 01:28:56.891]  The NSA is going to intercept all internet traffic.
[01:28:56.891 --> 01:29:05.736]  They're building NSA centers in San Antonio and New York and Florida and Minnesota and California and just admitting they're reading everything we're doing.
[01:29:05.736 --> 01:29:12.721]  So they go from we're not spying on Al-Qaeda to we are spying on Al-Qaeda to we're spying on you and we don't need no stinking warrants.
[01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:14.002]  Did you ever think that would happen?
[01:29:14.943 --> 01:29:22.107]  Well, it will happen because, yeah, I can believe it happening, Alex, because of apathetic people out there.
[01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:24.889]  People who cannot be apathetic any longer.
[01:29:24.889 --> 01:29:27.431]  You can't sit on your hands anymore.
[01:29:27.431 --> 01:29:33.995]  You can't sit back and have government tell you they're going to protect you, but in lieu of that protection, you're going to give up your freedoms.
[01:29:34.495 --> 01:29:40.478]  You are better off to be in danger from terrorists than you are to lose your freedoms.
[01:29:40.478 --> 01:29:46.721]  Don't let them take your freedoms and always remember dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.
[01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:48.902]  Governor Jesse Ventura, amazing having you on.
[01:29:48.902 --> 01:29:51.243]  That's a great way to end it.
[01:29:51.243 --> 01:29:55.145]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.145 --> 01:29:57.867]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:04.399]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:09.724]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.724 --> 01:30:11.785]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.785 --> 01:30:16.789]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.789 --> 01:30:17.690]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:19.071]  When do you want it?
[01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:20.952]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.952 --> 01:30:22.033]  When will you need it?
[01:30:22.033 --> 01:30:24.235]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.235 --> 01:30:25.576]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.576 --> 01:30:27.097]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.097 --> 01:30:32.381]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:35.964]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:39.427]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:40.987]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.987 --> 01:30:41.888]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.888 --> 01:30:43.008]  How much do you want?
[01:30:43.008 --> 01:30:43.928]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.928 --> 01:30:45.029]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:45.029 --> 01:30:48.069]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:32:00.086 --> 01:32:05.394]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.394 --> 01:32:09.921]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.921 --> 01:32:12.205]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.205 --> 01:32:13.827]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.827 --> 01:32:14.869]  There is a solution.

[01:33:14.661 --> 01:33:20.307]  Well, Judge Napolitano is our guest today, and I'm very, very excited to have him on.
[01:33:20.307 --> 01:33:24.771]  This is an abbreviated visit, but we're going to get him back on for a full 30 minutes or maybe even an hour.
[01:33:26.255 --> 01:33:28.696]  And he's, of course, from Newark, New Jersey.
[01:33:28.696 --> 01:33:33.497]  He's a tenured Superior Court judge in New Jersey and now an analyst on Fox News Channel.
[01:33:33.497 --> 01:33:41.219]  He has an extremely popular syndicated radio show and has Freedom Watch from Fox News Studios, which is an internet television show.
[01:33:41.219 --> 01:33:43.920]  And he also is the guest host for Glenn Beck.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.140]  I wish he was!
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:50.521]  The person doing that show because he is the real Bonafide.
[01:33:50.521 --> 01:34:14.526]  He wrote an editorial last week pointing out that the Republican health care plan was almost as bad as the Democrats and he is a constitutionalist right up there with Ron Paul and so he's somebody I actually agree with on like 98% of stuff instead of Glenn Beck 90% because that 10% is a big area and so here for about 15 minutes to talk about health care
[01:34:15.246 --> 01:34:17.607]  Well thank you Alex, it's good to be on with you.
[01:34:43.283 --> 01:34:44.844]  There's so much happening.
[01:34:44.844 --> 01:34:53.911]  What's more important, cap and trade and the total micromanagement of our life by special interests with Al Gore set to make the money, or the government takeover of healthcare?
[01:34:53.911 --> 01:34:57.193]  Oh boy, that's really a pick-your-poison, Alex.
[01:34:57.193 --> 01:35:01.036]  It's all part of the same big-government mentality.
[01:35:01.036 --> 01:35:10.963]  Your kind comments about the piece I wrote was really from a monologue that I gave while filling in for Glenn Beck, which I'm also doing later today at 5 o'clock Eastern, by the way.
[01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:16.724]  On Fox News Channel, in which I argued that we don't have a two-party system in this country.
[01:35:16.724 --> 01:35:20.505]  We have a one party, one political party called the Big Government Party.
[01:35:20.505 --> 01:35:27.567]  The Republican branch likes war and deficits and assaulting our civil liberties.
[01:35:27.567 --> 01:35:33.949]  And the Democratic branch likes wealth transfers and taxes and assaulting our commercial liberties.
[01:35:34.389 --> 01:35:36.191]  But the mindset is the same.
[01:35:36.191 --> 01:35:51.724]  The heck with the Constitution, the heck with the Bill of Rights, the heck with inalienable rights, the heck with even the laws that we write, we know what's better for you than what you know is good for yourself and we will tell you how to obey or else.
[01:35:51.724 --> 01:35:55.047]  Cap and Trade is one manifestation of that.
[01:35:55.047 --> 01:35:59.070]  Obamacare is another manifestation of it.
[01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:00.912]  I was furious last week.
[01:36:01.807 --> 01:36:22.927]  When I saw that even the Republicans, even so-called conservative Republicans, not Ron Paul, but many in the Republican leadership in the House, introduced Obamacare Light, which basically presumes a federal role in healthcare, of which there is none under the Constitution, tells insurance carriers you
[01:36:22.927 --> 01:36:23.027]  Yes.
[01:36:37.961 --> 01:36:41.942]  So this was all the same mindset of, we in Washington can micromanage the private
[01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:16.053]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest today.
[01:37:16.053 --> 01:37:22.194]  Judge, what you're talking about and reading over the legislation, it's like Groundhog Day but on a bigger scale.
[01:37:22.194 --> 01:37:26.215]  It's Chicago or New York, big city, crime boss,
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.141]  I don't know.
[01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:58.227]  Or hadn't paid the protection money, you lost your dealership, even though some of the dealerships were over 80 years old and made millions of dollars a year.
[01:37:58.227 --> 01:38:06.189]  And so now you have this 10th Amendment destroying federal power coming in with these unelected panels.
[01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:10.290]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:12.250]  And I fear it can pass the Senate.
[01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:15.411]  I'm hearing some of the Republican leadership saying, oh no, it won't.
[01:38:15.411 --> 01:38:17.732]  They said it wouldn't pass the House in the last two weeks.
[01:38:18.266 --> 01:38:22.989]  Well, they did say it wouldn't pass the House, and it did pass by a two-vote margin.
[01:38:22.989 --> 01:38:29.594]  And, you know, you really can't tell with politicians, because the leadership will bribe them.
[01:38:29.594 --> 01:38:36.438]  Remember the first time TARP, the so-called Troubled Asset Relief Program, went through the House, it was defeated.
[01:38:36.438 --> 01:38:47.686]  I remember, I was on the Fox Business Network at the moment, fist in air, just emoting joy, shouting, the beast is dead.
[01:38:48.366 --> 01:38:58.220]  But I was naive because the leadership came back and bribed by, you know, we'll build a courthouse in your district, your friend wants to become a federal judge, he's got it, just vote for us on TARP.
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:00.743]  And eventually people changed their vote.
[01:39:00.743 --> 01:39:04.608]  I fear that the same thing will happen with respect to Obamacare, the government.
[01:39:05.349 --> 01:39:17.595]  The executive branch, the leadership in both parties, in both houses, will bribe those who are wavering and give them something else that they want in order to secure their vote.
[01:39:17.595 --> 01:39:26.499]  But you also raise a very important issue about the delegation of federal power to non-elected groups.
[01:39:26.499 --> 01:39:31.961]  This is what FDR did, and FDR is the model for President Barack Obama.
[01:39:31.961 --> 01:39:33.502]  FDR had over five
[01:39:33.962 --> 01:39:43.109]  A hundred groups throughout the country appointed by local politicians who decided what prices and wages were.
[01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:59.802]  There's a famous case in my home state of New Jersey where an Eastern European immigrant opened up a dry cleaning shop and the local wage and price group declared that you would charge 40 cents to clean and press a man's suit.
[01:40:00.402 --> 01:40:09.288]  This guy charged 35 cents, literally a nickel cheaper than what the unelected local board said he could charge.
[01:40:09.288 --> 01:40:24.517]  He was arrested by the FBI, he was indicted by a grand jury, he was put on trial in federal court in Newark, and he served a three-month prison term in a federal prison for charging five cents less than what the local board allowed him to.
[01:40:24.517 --> 01:40:26.399]  Now, transform that
[01:40:27.279 --> 01:40:29.801]  ...into modern day practice of medicine.
[01:40:29.801 --> 01:40:37.507]  You will have a board of bureaucrats, not even physicians, bureaucrats, that will be between you and your physician.
[01:40:37.507 --> 01:40:55.701]  You will lose your privacy, you will lose the freedom of choice, because the bureaucratic board will give your physician a list of diagnostic tools that she or he can use to address your ailment, and then a list of procedures and medicines that she or he can prescribe.
[01:40:56.021 --> 01:40:57.701]  That's all in there.
[01:40:57.701 --> 01:41:03.303]  And that's why they're saying they're going to get all these hundreds of billions out of Medicare and Medicaid by reducing the care.
[01:41:03.303 --> 01:41:08.064]  Tom Daschle wrote a book admitting if you're old, you don't deserve it, you don't need it.
[01:41:08.064 --> 01:41:17.666]  People are really about to find out who these eugenicists are, who these control freaks are that inhabit the Democratic Party and to some extent the Republican Party.
[01:41:17.666 --> 01:41:25.588]  In the five minutes we've got left with Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us today in a very busy schedule, I want to shift gears now.
[01:41:26.625 --> 01:41:27.025]  I think?
[01:41:52.733 --> 01:41:54.896]  I must reluctantly agree with you.
[01:41:54.896 --> 01:42:06.672]  I say reluctantly, not because I don't like to agree with you, I do, but because I was naively expecting that we would not see this kind of build-up under him that we saw under George W. Bush.
[01:42:06.672 --> 01:42:08.875]  But think about it, war is the health of the state.
[01:42:09.835 --> 01:42:21.801]  When we fight a war, people will look the other way when our taxes are raised and when the government takes away their freedom because they accept the illusion that by fighting the war, the government is somehow keeping them safe.
[01:42:21.801 --> 01:42:27.744]  Presidents love war because it lets them escape the confines of the Constitution.
[01:42:27.744 --> 01:42:30.145]  It lets them become a little bit of a prince.
[01:42:30.145 --> 01:42:35.508]  It even causes judges sometimes, if the president does something under the guise of war-making,
[01:42:35.848 --> 01:42:36.649]  Judge, were you surprised?
[01:43:11.293 --> 01:43:32.670]  Were you surprised that Obama flip-flopped so strongly and went from being anti-patriot act to zealously defending it, wanting to expand it, and complete warrantless wiretapping, complete secret arrest, complete... I mean, he's going further than Bush on the police state.
[01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:33.711]  I didn't think that was possible.
[01:43:33.991 --> 01:43:38.395]  I didn't think it was possible either, and I was absolutely crushed when I heard it.
[01:43:38.395 --> 01:43:50.246]  He obviously was not my candidate of choice, but I took a little bit of internal intellectual solace in the fact that at least we were getting a president who would respect the Constitution.
[01:43:50.246 --> 01:43:54.430]  How wrong I was, his disrespect for the Constitution,
[01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:55.210]  Exactly.
[01:43:55.210 --> 01:44:00.333]  I've talked to a lot of lawyers and judges and I wanted to briefly see if you agree.
[01:44:22.265 --> 01:44:39.315]  Even though a lot of conservatives didn't like Obama, true paleo-conservatives, libertarian types like Ron Paul and yourself, because he is a constitutional lawyer and practiced it for 10 years as a professor, people expected that Obama would try to, at least on the surface, restore some of the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:42.276]  But instead, you know, he's saying, Constitution?
[01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:43.617]  It's just a GD piece of paper.
[01:44:44.865 --> 01:44:49.367]  I, too, expected that he would show more respect for the Constitution.
[01:44:49.367 --> 01:44:53.608]  I read some of the lectures he gave at the University of Chicago Law School.
[01:44:53.608 --> 01:45:01.691]  I could have given some of those lectures myself when I taught Constitutional Law at Seton Hall Law School in Newark and at Delaware Law School in Wilmington, Delaware.
[01:45:02.551 --> 01:45:23.783]  But, you know, something happens when you don the mantle of power, and that something is a disdain for the restraint on your power, a disdain for the natural law, a respect that we have natural rights beyond which no government can go, a disdain for the Constitution itself, a disdain for our inalienable rights, same as natural rights, and a disdain for the Bill of Rights.
[01:45:23.783 --> 01:45:27.125]  They just simply don't care.
[01:45:27.125 --> 01:45:27.705]  They will steal
[01:45:27.705 --> 01:45:28.045]  Thank you.
[01:45:45.373 --> 01:45:45.953]  Well said.
[01:45:45.953 --> 01:45:46.634]  Final question.
[01:45:46.634 --> 01:45:48.795]  I'm going to let you go because I know you've got to fill in.
[01:45:48.795 --> 01:45:49.996]  Guest host for Glenn Beck tonight.
[01:45:49.996 --> 01:45:55.558]  Congratulations on your huge success as your star rises because you're the bonafide constitutionalist.
[01:45:55.558 --> 01:45:59.180]  We really, really appreciate you, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.121]  But in closing,
[01:46:01.636 --> 01:46:08.758]  I would like to get you to comment, A, on just how special George Washington and Andrew Jackson were.
[01:46:08.758 --> 01:46:11.198]  They got all this power and then did give it up.
[01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:14.119]  They wanted George Washington to be a king.
[01:46:14.119 --> 01:46:25.562]  These were amazing founding fathers we had, and what would they think of what's happening today, where NOAA Satellite Information Service, the federal government, admits the coldest
[01:46:26.437 --> 01:46:33.744]  ...winner so far in the last 50 years, the third coldest in the last 100.
[01:46:33.744 --> 01:46:41.271]  Meanwhile, they're openly announcing that they're going to list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste and tax it when humans exhale it.
[01:46:41.271 --> 01:46:50.320]  Can you end with speaking about our founders compared to the material we've got in Washington today and what they would think of taxing what plants breathe?
[01:46:51.461 --> 01:46:55.825]  The founders tried to do two things with the Constitution.
[01:46:55.825 --> 01:47:05.955]  One was to create a federal government strong enough to protect us from invasion and to do national type things like run a post office and make sure that there's trade between the states.
[01:47:05.955 --> 01:47:10.499]  The other was to restrain the federal government so that it wouldn't interfere with our personal liberties.
[01:47:10.899 --> 01:47:26.839]  They specifically gave us a constitution that kept the federal government away from any type of relationship with individuals because they knew that the greatest threat to freedom comes not from your enemy on the outside who you can see and look at.
[01:47:27.439 --> 01:47:34.386]  But from the smiling face of the government on the inside, who claims that it's going to take care of you.
[01:47:34.386 --> 01:47:40.512]  And presidents like George Washington, whose closest advisor, Alexander Hamilton, wanted him to be king.
[01:47:40.512 --> 01:47:51.242]  And Andrew Jackson, who basically said to the Supreme Court, you know, they've gone ahead and made their federal bank, let them find the money and put them on the deposits in the federal bank.
[01:47:51.642 --> 01:48:03.249]  These were people who understood that there were natural limits on what government can do and written limits on what the federal government can do, and they stuck to those limits.
[01:48:03.249 --> 01:48:21.000]  The present government and its predecessors, you know, from Lincoln to Wilson to FDR to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, have so distorted out of proportion what the federal government is to do that the founders would not recognize it at all and would probably want to take up arms against it.
[01:48:21.826 --> 01:48:23.687]  What are you covering tonight and then we'll let you go.
[01:48:23.687 --> 01:48:27.950]  I hope you're going to be covering the health care and cap-and-trade because... That's exactly what we're talking about.
[01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:29.311]  We're talking about health care.
[01:48:29.311 --> 01:48:32.273]  We're talking about the state of the economy.
[01:48:32.273 --> 01:48:47.243]  We're talking about the government subpoenaing media entities wanting to know who earns how much money because they have to decide whose income taxes to audit next.
[01:48:47.243 --> 01:48:47.883]  You're kidding!
[01:48:47.883 --> 01:48:48.323]  Wait a minute.
[01:48:48.323 --> 01:48:48.864]  They're not just
[01:48:49.668 --> 01:48:59.352]  The federal government is subpoenaing media people to- They're subpoenaing media companies to find out who learns what and what their social security numbers are.
[01:48:59.352 --> 01:49:05.035]  This is getting so bad, so quickly, far worse than any of us imagined.
[01:49:05.035 --> 01:49:09.777]  And the present president hasn't even celebrated his first year in office yet.
[01:49:09.777 --> 01:49:10.958]  Well since you brought that up-
[01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:14.540]  Since you brought that up, let me just ask you now.
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:19.623]  Senator Lamar Alexander's gone to the floor and talked about he's confirmed there's an enemies list.
[01:49:19.623 --> 01:49:24.806]  He warned him and said, look, I worked for Nixon, don't do this.
[01:49:24.806 --> 01:49:27.588]  It's been reported I am on the enemies list.
[01:49:27.588 --> 01:49:28.428]  I'm going from memory.
[01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:29.789]  I think you are too.
[01:49:29.789 --> 01:49:30.469]  But what is it?
[01:49:30.469 --> 01:49:32.511]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:49:32.511 --> 01:49:36.413]  It is scary to know that there's a real enemies list.
[01:49:36.413 --> 01:49:39.595]  And this is I mean, is this not illegal, Judge?
[01:49:40.618 --> 01:49:49.590]  Well, it's illegal for the President to compile a list of people who disagree with him on the basis of their political opinions and their outspoken words.
[01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:57.561]  That was specifically written into the privacy law in 1974, enacted and signed into law by President Ford shortly after
[01:49:58.301 --> 01:49:59.702]  President Nixon resigned.
[01:49:59.702 --> 01:50:04.564]  These are restraints expressly enacted to restrain the president.
[01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:14.348]  But this White House, just like it doesn't respect freedom of contract, just like it doesn't respect freedom of speech, just like it doesn't respect privacy, doesn't respect this either.
[01:50:15.461 --> 01:50:20.884]  Well, I tell you, it's scary, and everybody should pray for the people that are on that list, myself included.
[01:50:20.884 --> 01:50:26.026]  Judge, what's the best website for people to visit to find out about all things Judge Napolitano?
[01:50:26.026 --> 01:50:37.792]  Well, they can go to foxnews.com, where my Freedom Watch appears, as do my monologues when I fill in for Glenn, as do many of my op-eds.
[01:50:37.792 --> 01:50:41.253]  And, Alex, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being on with you.
[01:50:41.253 --> 01:50:44.575]  I hope we get to do this a lot more in the future.
[01:50:45.291 --> 01:50:45.912]  Absolutely.
[01:50:45.912 --> 01:50:47.093]  Thank you, Judge.
[01:50:47.093 --> 01:50:47.574]  Take care.
[01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:49.116]  Have a great weekend coming up.
[01:50:49.116 --> 01:50:50.377]  You as well.

[01:50:51.559 --> 01:50:54.823]  It's Wednesday, but I'm already thinking about the weekend because I'm going deer hunting.
[01:50:54.823 --> 01:50:56.004]  All right.
[01:50:56.004 --> 01:50:58.247]  Yeah, you go get your hamburger out of the drive-thru window.
[01:50:58.247 --> 01:50:58.888]  That's okay.
[01:50:58.888 --> 01:50:59.749]  I'm able to go hunting.

[01:51:48.522 --> 01:51:52.063]  Seasons greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[01:52:01.004 --> 01:52:02.305]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.305 --> 01:52:07.911]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.911 --> 01:52:12.916]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.916 --> 01:52:18.502]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.502 --> 01:52:23.187]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:30.823]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.823 --> 01:52:31.943]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.943 --> 01:52:38.626]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.626 --> 01:52:41.828]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.828 --> 01:52:44.989]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.989 --> 01:52:45.189]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:52.853 --> 01:52:57.677]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.677 --> 01:53:01.100]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:04.483]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:53:04.483 --> 01:53:08.386]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[01:53:08.386 --> 01:53:12.109]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:20.316]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal
[01:53:20.316 --> 01:53:20.656]  I think so.

[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:54.381]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[01:54:16.207 --> 01:54:27.814]  Alright, getting back here.
[01:54:27.814 --> 01:54:28.895]  This is Ted Anderson.
[01:54:28.895 --> 01:54:30.175]  I'm just stepping in for Alex.
[01:54:30.175 --> 01:54:34.037]  He asked me to step in during this particular segment.
[01:54:34.037 --> 01:54:35.018]  Gold is running up.
[01:54:35.018 --> 01:54:36.239]  He called me.
[01:54:36.239 --> 01:54:38.480]  Hope he's having just a great time on his vacation.
[01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:44.871]  After the production of that Fall of the Republic, he certainly deserves a little bit of time off.
[01:54:44.871 --> 01:54:53.773]  For those of you who like to support him and for those of you who don't like to support him, in case you don't know, I've spent time with Alex down at his house.
[01:54:53.773 --> 01:55:03.275]  He gets his kids to bed and he ends up at about 11 o'clock going back to the office and producing these videos that he makes, which are so important as far as taking down the New World Order.
[01:55:03.275 --> 01:55:08.776]  I can't say it enough, for any one of you who haven't had a chance to purchase the Fall of the Republic,
[01:55:09.451 --> 01:55:13.352]  From Alex Jones' website, I'd suggest that you go there today.
[01:55:13.352 --> 01:55:17.193]  And for those of you that have it, make copies of it and get it to all your friends.
[01:55:17.193 --> 01:55:21.114]  I mean, I can't think of a better tool for education for the people.
[01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:23.735]  But anyways, let's get back to gold here.
[01:55:23.735 --> 01:55:27.856]  I was just reading today, gold holds firmly above $1,100 an ounce of CNN money.
[01:55:31.565 --> 01:55:33.986]  And it's just been just a hot market.
[01:55:33.986 --> 01:55:41.088]  I need to tell you, gold is falling today because the dollar is... I'm sorry, gold is rising today because the dollar is falling.
[01:55:41.088 --> 01:55:43.468]  We have another drop in the dollar right now.
[01:55:43.468 --> 01:55:46.689]  The dollar index is at 75.19.
[01:55:46.689 --> 01:55:49.710]  And gold has reached a high today of $1,118.50 so far.
[01:55:53.883 --> 01:56:04.337]  I need to say that it would have been something if we hit $1,120 an ounce or $1,110 and we backed off down into the $1,050, $1,060 range again.
[01:56:04.337 --> 01:56:09.123]  I could say maybe we're at the end of this run, but we're not.
[01:56:09.123 --> 01:56:11.506]  Gold has been holding real strong, holding firmly.
[01:56:12.054 --> 01:56:24.964]  American Barrick, I say American Barrick because when I was a stockbroker I was selling it as American Barrick, now it's called Barrick, now has to shut off, shut down any of its hedging.
[01:56:24.964 --> 01:56:32.770]  And for those of you who don't understand what hedging means in the gold industry, when you're in the mining business it means that you're selling short your reserves that are sitting in the ground.
[01:56:34.125 --> 01:56:35.646]  You're looking at today's prices.
[01:56:35.646 --> 01:56:37.627]  You think that this is a good time to do it.
[01:56:37.627 --> 01:56:47.252]  You sell your gold that you haven't even mined yet, knowing what your production is going to be because you've done core samples, and you deliver it later when the contracts come due.
[01:56:47.252 --> 01:56:54.195]  Barrick was one of the largest sellers of gold all the way through the 1980s going into the 1990s and the 2000s.
[01:56:54.195 --> 01:56:58.957]  It was one of the central bank's tools in order to keep the gold prices down.
[01:56:58.957 --> 01:57:01.919]  You can go to gata.org and find that out.
[01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:05.691]  Right now, I need to tell you that the market is hot.
[01:57:05.691 --> 01:57:09.553]  It is hot, hot, hot in gold, and I don't expect it to change.
[01:57:09.553 --> 01:57:23.602]  The dollar is going to be falling as these central banks of the world decide to get into gold and get away from paper currency, and if the manufacturers of the money in these countries aren't telling you enough to get into gold, I don't know what you need.
[01:57:23.602 --> 01:57:25.043]  Right now, we're sitting on a U.S.
[01:57:25.043 --> 01:57:31.867]  paper currency fiat system that seems to be eroding away, while foreigners are sitting on reserves that are just
[01:57:32.427 --> 01:57:32.567]  Sure.
[01:57:53.553 --> 01:57:54.935]  Silver's a good buy, too.
[01:57:54.935 --> 01:57:57.097]  Walking Liberty halves at $8.69.
[01:57:57.097 --> 01:58:01.282]  Now we're at $9 if you don't mention the Alex Jones Show Special.
[01:58:01.282 --> 01:58:05.987]  So get them while they're still at $8.69, while I still can offer them at that price.
[01:58:05.987 --> 01:58:07.228]  Lakota coins, again, $22.30.
[01:58:07.228 --> 01:58:07.789]  That's a great buy.
[01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:12.052]  $10 Liberties right now at $8.18.
[01:58:12.052 --> 01:58:16.515]  There's just a whole long line of items you can buy here at Midas.
[01:58:16.515 --> 01:58:20.938]  I would call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:20.938 --> 01:58:23.219]  Find out what your options are for gold and silver.
[01:58:23.219 --> 01:58:26.701]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:26.701 --> 01:58:32.705]  Those of you who are sitting in paper currency type of investments, take a serious look at this time.
[01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:34.026]  You really need to.
[01:58:34.026 --> 01:58:36.247]  Again, 1-800-686-2237 right here for Midas.
[01:58:42.731 --> 01:58:45.981]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.981 --> 01:58:48.187]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.799 --> 01:58:59.944]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.944 --> 01:59:03.306]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:03.306 --> 01:59:09.189]  Instead, use vitamin C-D and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:13.972]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.972 --> 01:59:16.313]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:59:16.493 --> 01:59:16.913]  Thank you.
[01:59:35.404 --> 01:59:39.125]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:59:39.125 --> 01:59:41.326]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.

[01:59:47.829 --> 01:59:50.009]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:59:50.009 --> 01:59:54.051]  Do it now.
[01:59:54.051 --> 01:59:56.432]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.432 --> 01:59:59.173]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:22.053]  We are back live, continuing with your phone calls and covering the news in this hour.
[02:00:22.053 --> 02:00:25.414]  So much going on with the economy, joblessness.
[02:00:25.414 --> 02:00:27.035]  Federal government's reporting at about 10%.
[02:00:27.035 --> 02:00:30.417]  How can we have a jobless recovery?
[02:00:30.417 --> 02:00:37.500]  There's also been a terrible shooting in Florida, in an Orlando office building.
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:39.441]  At least eight people shot there.
[02:00:42.068 --> 02:00:53.133]  And of course you have the 12 dead, 30 plus wounded at Fort Hood with all the security there, showing that nothing can stop a nut, except for the Second Amendment.
[02:00:53.133 --> 02:00:59.135]  And this female police officer who reportedly shot this individual four times and stopped him.
[02:00:59.135 --> 02:01:02.096]  Thank God that she didn't wait like they did at Blacksburg and other places.
[02:01:02.096 --> 02:01:05.578]  She charged in and took this guy out.
[02:01:05.578 --> 02:01:07.959]  So she certainly deserves a lot of praise.
[02:01:09.288 --> 02:01:35.030]  For that but they've changed the story to me so many times who knows what's going on for six hours They said this guy was dead, and they said he was alive so our hearts and prayers go out to all of those at Fort Hood and Not just in Texas, but in Orlando, Florida just terrible, okay We're going to break here in a few minutes But he'll be with us for several segments, and I'm really excited about this interview because I saw the article
[02:01:36.272 --> 02:01:57.690]  In McClatchy Newspapers, not this Sunday but last Sunday, and it dovetailed with Professor Black we've had on, a federal regulator, former federal regulator, and so many, John Perkins who we've had on, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, all these other insiders talking about Goldman Sachs is just really involved in a lot of amazing behavior.
[02:01:57.690 --> 02:02:00.713]  But the headline is, How Goldman Sachs Secretly Bet on the U.S.
[02:02:00.713 --> 02:02:01.714]  Housing Crash.
[02:02:02.902 --> 02:02:08.327]  And to go over that is the author, the investigative reporter, award-winning investigative reporter, Greg Gordon.
[02:02:08.327 --> 02:02:16.233]  And he's written for some of the biggest newspapers in the country and right now is writing for McClatchy News Service and newspapers.
[02:02:16.233 --> 02:02:21.077]  And he's broken a lot of just huge international
[02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:29.855]  We're about to go to break, but just in a nutshell, this is one of the most in-depth, detailed investigative reports I've seen on the banking industry in Goldman Sachs.
[02:02:29.855 --> 02:02:31.215]  This is just an amazing job.
[02:02:31.215 --> 02:02:31.796]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:31.796 --> 02:02:33.316]  In a nutshell, what did you discover?
[02:02:51.775 --> 02:02:57.168]  Well, we wanted to find out how Goldman Sachs got out when nobody else...
[02:02:58.078 --> 02:02:59.278]  It did.
[02:02:59.278 --> 02:03:06.160]  And so, the first story of the series is really about how Goldman was selling off.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:08.280]  At some stage, it became a sell-off.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:21.683]  We don't know exactly what that date is, but in 2006 and 2007, Goldman sold $39 billion of bonds, essentially bonds, backed by risky mortgages registered in the United States.
[02:03:23.303 --> 02:03:23.483]  Yes.
[02:03:40.479 --> 02:03:52.024]  And at the same time, Goldman was betting in these dark markets through devices that are known as credit default swaps, but they're basically insurance-like bets.
[02:03:52.024 --> 02:04:03.589]  You're buying a little insurance policy on some specific thing, and they were betting that the housing market would go south and that these bonds would all lose value.
[02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:07.030]  So they start quietly dumping on the market,
[02:04:08.250 --> 02:04:17.497]  Triple A rated paper that was tied to derivatives, or exotic instruments as they're called, and at the same time betting against it after they dumped it.
[02:04:17.497 --> 02:04:18.838]  Man, that is amazing!
[02:04:21.141 --> 02:04:23.442]  Well, I want to be clear.
[02:04:23.442 --> 02:04:32.404]  They were making bets on similar, but not exactly the same security, but on similar issues.
[02:04:32.404 --> 02:04:45.327]  So in other words, they were betting that the housing market's going to go bad, and if the housing market goes bad, all these mortgages are going to go south, or many of the mortgages, because people are going to find themselves underwater in their houses.
[02:04:45.327 --> 02:04:50.108]  We know people across the country have homes that are worth less than their mortgages.
[02:04:50.388 --> 02:04:50.808]  Sure, sure.
[02:04:50.808 --> 02:04:51.789]  That's been well documented.
[02:04:51.789 --> 02:04:55.712]  We're going to break, come back in a long segment, get more into this incredible article.
[02:04:55.712 --> 02:04:58.553]  And he's saying it's the first in a series.
[02:04:58.553 --> 02:04:59.754]  Can't wait to read more.
[02:04:59.754 --> 02:05:00.815]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.815 --> 02:05:04.217]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.217 --> 02:05:07.839]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.839 --> 02:05:12.402]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.402 --> 02:05:18.006]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.286 --> 02:05:23.051]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:23.051 --> 02:05:26.674]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.674 --> 02:05:31.499]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.499 --> 02:05:38.065]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:38.065 --> 02:05:40.007]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.487 --> 02:05:43.689]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:06:01.499 --> 02:06:04.503]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.503 --> 02:06:09.830]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:11.893]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.893 --> 02:06:16.459]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.459 --> 02:06:16.939]  We're good to go.
[02:06:39.867 --> 02:06:41.088]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.088 --> 02:06:42.009]  We don't know.
[02:06:42.009 --> 02:06:43.110]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:44.051]  All you can get.
[02:06:44.051 --> 02:06:45.132]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.132 --> 02:06:48.194]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.194 --> 02:06:50.396]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:50.396 --> 02:06:51.397]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:05.737]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.737 --> 02:07:10.263]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.263 --> 02:07:12.546]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.546 --> 02:07:14.168]  You don't have to cooperate.

[02:08:01.463 --> 02:08:06.764]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:06.764 --> 02:08:11.385]  He's written multiple parts in a detailed series.
[02:08:11.385 --> 02:08:14.726]  The first of which we've been covering off and on for the last week and a half.
[02:08:14.726 --> 02:08:16.747]  How Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[02:08:16.747 --> 02:08:17.847]  housing crash.
[02:08:17.847 --> 02:08:22.248]  Let me just read you a couple lines from Greg Gordon's syndicated article.
[02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:38.561]  It says, uh, to piece together Goldman's role in subprime meltdown, McClatchy reviewed hundreds of documents, SEC filings, copies of secret investment circulars, lawsuits, and interviewed numerous people familiar with the firm's activities.
[02:08:38.561 --> 02:08:45.867]  And, uh, then they go through in this article, piece by piece, uh, uh, Mr. Gordon did,
[02:08:46.869 --> 02:08:59.376]  Exactly how this was done and so just stating in layman terms What do we know Goldman Sachs did they are the only big group to get out of this you talk about how?
[02:08:59.376 --> 02:09:12.423]  This was used against their competition like Bear Stearns and others All these other groups went belly-up, but Goldman Sachs came out smelling like a rose record profits record bonuses at the same time
[02:09:13.765 --> 02:09:23.473]  We see an over-representation of Goldman Sachs alumni in regulatory and government positions, and I want to get into that with you as well.
[02:09:23.473 --> 02:09:28.998]  But I know as a journalist, you just want to stay to the facts, but I also want to talk about these documents that you got a hold of.
[02:09:28.998 --> 02:09:33.902]  But, I mean, let's go through exactly what's happening here and where this is going.
[02:09:35.157 --> 02:09:51.623]  And let me say that it's not an accident that so many Goldman executives go on to senior jobs in the government, because Goldman for decades has encouraged its members once they have attained
[02:09:54.712 --> 02:09:57.473]  We're good to go.
[02:10:18.616 --> 02:10:31.023]  You know, outside the normal markets, you create appearances at the minimum that are very awkward and in some cases disturbing.
[02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:41.530]  Here you had Hank Paulson serving as a Treasury Secretary at the end of the Bush administration last fall, in September, when everything blew up.
[02:10:41.530 --> 02:10:46.933]  And it seemed as if every decision, every key decision that was made
[02:10:47.819 --> 02:10:58.722]  Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it seems as if every key decision, where Goldman Sachs was a stakeholder, the decision benefited Goldman Sachs.
[02:10:58.722 --> 02:11:06.085]  They took over Bear Stearns when Bear Stearns collapsed, and Goldman had contracts with Bear.
[02:11:06.085 --> 02:11:09.906]  We don't talk about this in the series, but it's true.
[02:11:09.906 --> 02:11:15.327]  And Goldman was able to settle out when JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns.
[02:11:15.327 --> 02:11:17.208]  That was a deal arranged by Goldman.
[02:11:18.089 --> 02:11:25.236]  Paulson and then Lehman Brothers, which was a big Goldman rival, was allowed to go under.
[02:11:25.236 --> 02:11:29.040]  And that is going to be a decision that will be debated for a very long time.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:31.963]  Lehman's collapse caused a lot of
[02:11:34.305 --> 02:11:35.085]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:11:52.012 --> 02:12:05.463]  AIG, the American International Group, and Goldman had placed $20 billion of these insurance-like bets with AIG, the American International Group.
[02:12:10.543 --> 02:12:16.006]  Goldman got paid off out of this money, this rescue money from the government.
[02:12:16.006 --> 02:12:34.316]  Goldman was paid $12.9 billion, and over $8 billion of that related to its secret bets, hedging, its subprime and other related risky mortgage-backed securities.
[02:12:34.316 --> 02:12:36.577]  And it's also noteworthy that when these
[02:12:39.375 --> 02:12:42.801]  The 12.9 billion dollars was paid off.
[02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:45.005]  It was a hundred cents on the dollar.
[02:12:46.127 --> 02:12:56.014]  So it was decided that even the officials at AIG wanted to offer considerably less money to the various counterparties on all these bets it was holding.
[02:12:56.014 --> 02:13:02.218]  And by the way, AIG made a dreadful mistake because AIG did not reinsure all these bets.
[02:13:02.218 --> 02:13:05.480]  It just assumed that the housing market was going to go up forever.
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:15.106]  And when it turned south, all of a sudden, instead of just getting these nice premiums from Goldman and I presume Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers every year, you know, paying
[02:13:16.627 --> 02:13:17.188]  I think so.
[02:13:35.955 --> 02:13:47.421]  So, Goldman Sachs really always benefited from the decisions that were made by the government officials, including its alumni.
[02:13:47.421 --> 02:13:49.142]  Greg Gordon's our guest.
[02:13:49.142 --> 02:13:55.605]  He's an investigative journalist with McClatchy Washington Bureau, and there's several parts in the series.
[02:13:55.605 --> 02:13:57.666]  One is how Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[02:13:57.666 --> 02:13:58.446]  housing crash.
[02:13:58.446 --> 02:14:01.888]  Another, Goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes.
[02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:06.451]  Another one, mystery, why did Goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought?
[02:14:06.451 --> 02:14:11.314]  Now, now, let me just be clear on this, reading over these pieces.
[02:14:11.314 --> 02:14:19.598]  You have Goldman Sachs, 2006-2007, everything supposedly wonderful, the housing market's gonna keep going up forever.
[02:14:19.598 --> 02:14:22.800]  Anyone who says that's not the case is a conspiracy theorist.
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:27.323]  We must give everyone a loan, even if they don't even have a job or rely on their application.
[02:14:27.323 --> 02:14:29.604]  It's the American way.
[02:14:29.604 --> 02:14:31.225]  Meanwhile, they're putting out
[02:14:32.205 --> 02:14:38.409]  Promotions saying housing's great, these instruments we're selling are wonderful.
[02:14:38.409 --> 02:14:54.541]  While betting against similar instruments, did the Goldman Sachs massive shorting, did that contribute to the overall bubble beginning to burst?
[02:14:54.541 --> 02:14:58.844]  Because that gets into a whole other area, not only
[02:15:00.419 --> 02:15:12.121]  Are they telling people these derivatives are great while they're separately betting against them secretly, but did their shorting contribute to the bubble beginning to deflate?
[02:15:12.833 --> 02:15:14.094]  Well, a couple things, Alex.
[02:15:14.094 --> 02:15:16.336]  One, there were derivatives.
[02:15:16.336 --> 02:15:17.997]  They were sold generally offshore.
[02:15:17.997 --> 02:15:28.744]  But the stuff they were selling here, and even to foreign customers, but they were registering and selling them here, were bonds.
[02:15:28.744 --> 02:15:32.487]  They were good old high-yield bonds, rated AAA.
[02:15:32.487 --> 02:15:34.368]  Rated AAA.
[02:15:34.368 --> 02:15:36.350]  But yet, Goldman was hedging them.
[02:15:37.023 --> 02:15:38.825]  Secretly hedging them.
[02:15:38.825 --> 02:15:54.544]  And when you, the second thing I just want to mention, when you talked about Goldman promoting the fact that the housing market was doing so well, I've seen reports that Goldman's chief economist was warning that a bubble was approaching, but that strikes me as also very
[02:15:57.126 --> 02:16:05.409]  Well, they always hedge their bet.
[02:16:05.409 --> 02:16:13.811]  I mean, sure, they're out here selling them, but then they also mention, ooh, there might be a problem, you know, irrational exuberance down the road.
[02:16:13.811 --> 02:16:15.912]  So, oopsie, I told you so.
[02:16:15.912 --> 02:16:18.913]  Oh, look, all my competition's destroyed now.
[02:16:18.913 --> 02:16:20.694]  Oh, look, I'm making record profits.
[02:16:20.694 --> 02:16:21.054]  Oh, look,
[02:16:21.414 --> 02:16:26.597]  We're so noble, we happen to have our people all over federal regulation systems.
[02:16:26.597 --> 02:16:30.440]  Ooh, man, we're becoming the only player now.
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:32.020]  Gee, we sure screwed up.
[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:38.104]  We sure screwed up into all this money and power.
[02:16:38.104 --> 02:16:42.247]  And you know, the thing about that, they always hedge their bets.
[02:16:42.247 --> 02:16:43.748]  These were AAA.
[02:16:43.748 --> 02:16:49.271]  And I asked Goldman Sachs, can you give me another example of AAA securities?
[02:16:50.051 --> 02:16:51.315]  That you hedged like this.
[02:16:52.213 --> 02:16:53.974]  And they did not provide such an example.
[02:16:53.974 --> 02:16:56.174]  They said, we hedge in a lot of our markets, etc.
[02:16:56.174 --> 02:17:08.219]  But to be betting the other way, at the same time you're selling something as AAA, the question is, should they have told the investors, we also are betting that the housing market's going to turn south?
[02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:19.623]  Because it was a risk factor right in, they list the risk factors and all the prospectuses which go to investors before the, and we're talking about, by the way, pension funds, insurance companies,
[02:17:20.283 --> 02:17:21.184]  We're good to go.
[02:17:43.772 --> 02:17:44.132]  I think so.
[02:18:00.623 --> 02:18:11.989]  Forty, forty-five percent of every bundle of securities that Goldman and others sold came from those states, or were based on mortgages that were written in those states.
[02:18:11.989 --> 02:18:28.459]  And so, what would have happened to the sales of these securities if Goldman had acknowledged to investors it disclosed in formal filings with the SEC or in the circulars they passed around on the deals they did in the Cayman Islands?
[02:18:29.682 --> 02:18:30.262]  What would happen?
[02:18:30.262 --> 02:18:32.083]  Would they be able to make these sales?
[02:18:32.083 --> 02:18:34.363]  And that's a big question.
[02:18:34.363 --> 02:18:35.864]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[02:18:35.864 --> 02:18:37.724]  I have a gold sponsor.
[02:18:37.724 --> 02:18:39.484]  And I have the gold sponsor on the air.
[02:18:39.484 --> 02:18:44.126]  And I really believe gold is going to go up the last six years from 300 bucks an ounce to 1,000.
[02:18:44.126 --> 02:18:45.686]  And it has.
[02:18:45.686 --> 02:18:48.027]  You're a smart guy.
[02:18:48.027 --> 02:18:51.407]  But if... So, I mean, it's simple.
[02:18:51.407 --> 02:18:53.508]  I mean, I tell people, I believe this is great.
[02:18:53.508 --> 02:18:54.508]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[02:18:54.508 --> 02:18:56.189]  Nothing's a silver bullet.
[02:18:56.189 --> 02:18:57.809]  Silver and gold is as close as you get.
[02:18:58.610 --> 02:19:09.974]  But then if it came out that I was internally betting against gold to go down, which I believe is going to continue to go up for a while, if I was wrong, that'd be okay.
[02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:18.537]  But if it came out that I knew it was going to go down, and I was telling people, oh, it's great, here, buy it, I could get in a lot of trouble for that.
[02:19:18.537 --> 02:19:27.880]  The question is, will Goldman Sachs get in trouble, or do they have so many of their people in regulatory positions and Larry Summers running the White House economic area that
[02:19:28.858 --> 02:19:32.439]  That they're not going to get in trouble.
[02:19:32.439 --> 02:19:34.019]  That's a good question.
[02:19:34.019 --> 02:19:35.559]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:19:35.559 --> 02:19:37.440]  Amazing series.
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:40.100]  I didn't know it was a series to show how stupid I am.
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:43.341]  I just read how Goldman secretly bet on the US housing crash.
[02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:47.762]  These are big, thick, meaty, documented articles.
[02:19:47.762 --> 02:19:49.582]  These are not little skinny things.
[02:19:49.582 --> 02:19:53.603]  And then he's got another accompanying series of shorter pieces.
[02:19:53.603 --> 02:19:55.103]  Just really powerful info.
[02:19:56.818 --> 02:19:58.220]  Should Goldman Sachs get in trouble?
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:00.302]  We'll ask him when we get back.
[02:20:00.302 --> 02:20:01.123]  If you've got mold.
[02:20:01.747 --> 02:20:06.369]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:04.080]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:04.400]  Yeah.

[02:22:01.522 --> 02:22:02.543]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.543 --> 02:22:08.088]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.088 --> 02:22:08.629]  I get it.
[02:22:08.629 --> 02:22:18.258]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:18.258 --> 02:22:19.399]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.659 --> 02:22:28.125]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.125 --> 02:22:31.527]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.527 --> 02:22:35.790]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:37.392]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.392 --> 02:22:40.794]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.794 --> 02:22:44.957]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.157 --> 02:22:46.058]  You should too.
[02:22:46.058 --> 02:22:47.198]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.198 --> 02:22:50.560]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:50.880]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:50.980]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:51.301]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.301 --> 02:22:52.221]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:22:52.221 --> 02:22:53.822]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:22:53.822 --> 02:22:55.763]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:23:11.252 --> 02:23:20.482]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[02:23:20.482 --> 02:23:22.704]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[02:23:22.704 --> 02:23:28.410]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:23:28.410 --> 02:23:33.175]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:23:33.835 --> 02:23:38.817]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:23:38.817 --> 02:23:41.918]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[02:24:06.374 --> 02:24:24.843]  Greg Gordon, investigative journalist, McClatchy, Washington Bureau, and he's broken national investigative pieces, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Detroit News, United Press International.
[02:24:24.843 --> 02:24:35.248]  He broke major stories on 9-11, EPA scandals, just so many other issues, and he is here with us
[02:24:36.341 --> 02:24:45.188]  Uh, today, okay, the question that I posed when we went into break was, does Goldman Sachs get in trouble for this?
[02:24:45.188 --> 02:24:57.018]  I mean, there's not even, that I know of, an investigation being done and the SEC is filled with Goldman Sachs people and, uh, I remember Paulson, it's in my film Follow the Republic,
[02:24:57.984 --> 02:25:07.010]  He's up there testifying and they say, you were at Goldman Sachs, how did you, Congressman Stern is asking him from Florida, how did you give your company money?
[02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:10.912]  And he goes, oh, I got a waiver from, and he said, where'd you get a waiver from?
[02:25:10.912 --> 02:25:15.234]  And he said, oh, I got a waiver from the Treasury Department, from himself.
[02:25:15.234 --> 02:25:17.096]  I mean, it's just, where does this go?
[02:25:17.096 --> 02:25:20.197]  Or do they just continue to get to write the rules?
[02:25:20.197 --> 02:25:20.918]  Because I interviewed
[02:25:21.633 --> 02:25:37.534]  A professor yesterday that you quote in your article and he said that all of this is just continuing, that the same people that set all this up are just continuing and so nothing's being reformed.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:44.981]  You're talking about Lawrence Kotlikoff of Boston University, I believe.
[02:25:44.981 --> 02:25:46.542]  Yes.
[02:25:46.542 --> 02:25:57.765]  And there are a lot of questions about, I'm not covering the reform process because I've been doing this, but there are a lot of questions about whether the right reforms are being done.
[02:25:57.765 --> 02:26:04.447]  Congress did create a commission to investigate the crash, the causes of the crash.
[02:26:05.369 --> 02:26:17.699]  They also, we also have the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is trying very hard right now to make amends for really blowing the Bernie Madoff investigation for years.
[02:26:17.699 --> 02:26:25.186]  I mean, there just was a big Inspector General's report that came out last week that talked about at least six instances in which
[02:26:26.118 --> 02:26:26.519]  Yes, I think so.
[02:26:42.774 --> 02:26:43.414]  We're good to go.
[02:26:59.985 --> 02:27:07.790]  And whether or not they properly, fully disclosed what they knew about these risky mortgages.
[02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:20.597]  The last piece of the series, I looked at Goldman's relationship with New Century Mortgage, a company that really was one of the classic high flyers in this sort of go-go industry.
[02:27:20.597 --> 02:27:21.458]  New Century
[02:27:22.421 --> 02:27:34.870]  In the mid-90s was a pretty small company doing some subprime mortgages, which were a little bit riskier than the traditional mortgages, and maybe had about $300 million plus in sales.
[02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:44.436]  And a decade later, New Century's revenues approached $60 billion in one year, which is staggering.
[02:27:44.436 --> 02:27:47.358]  They were the number two behind AmeriQuest.
[02:27:47.358 --> 02:27:49.299]  And New Century had about $9
[02:27:50.766 --> 02:27:51.006]  I think so.
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:24.473]  Well, I tallied up about $5 billion plus in mortgages from New Century, and I think the number's a bit higher, and maybe quite a bit higher.
[02:28:28.337 --> 02:28:28.637]  I think?
[02:28:51.958 --> 02:28:53.139]  We're good to go.
[02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:26.923]  Lending criteria, the credit criteria just began to become... Yes.
[02:29:26.923 --> 02:29:28.444]  It disappeared into thin air.
[02:29:28.444 --> 02:29:31.666]  So this is systemic fraud from top to bottom.
[02:29:31.666 --> 02:29:42.031]  I mean, that's what it's been... One of the things, I just want to mention this, Alex, and that is that like other Wall Street firms, Goldman hired contractors to look over these mortgages.
[02:29:42.031 --> 02:29:42.411]  Stay there.
[02:29:42.411 --> 02:29:43.212]  We got a break.
[02:29:43.212 --> 02:29:44.212]  We got a break.
[02:29:44.212 --> 02:29:45.853]  Come back and explain that to us.
[02:29:45.853 --> 02:29:46.433]  Okay.
[02:29:46.433 --> 02:29:49.635]  And then we'll ask you about some other points in your series.
[02:29:51.570 --> 02:29:55.493]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.493 --> 02:30:00.998]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.998 --> 02:30:08.004]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:08.004 --> 02:30:10.086]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:30:12.308 --> 02:30:13.969]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:30:13.969 --> 02:30:18.293]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:31:00.765 --> 02:31:05.306]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.306 --> 02:31:06.226]  Number one.
[02:31:06.226 --> 02:31:09.647]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.647 --> 02:31:10.507]  Number two.
[02:31:10.507 --> 02:31:15.389]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.389 --> 02:31:16.129]  It's true.
[02:31:16.129 --> 02:31:20.690]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.010 --> 02:31:21.831]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.831 --> 02:31:25.413]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.413 --> 02:31:29.335]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.335 --> 02:31:30.135]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.135 --> 02:31:32.897]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.897 --> 02:31:36.579]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.579 --> 02:31:37.360]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:41.502]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.502 --> 02:31:46.265]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.545 --> 02:31:50.729]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.729 --> 02:31:52.511]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:57.596 --> 02:32:08.427]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:32:08.427 --> 02:32:09.408]  You can buy it at
[02:32:09.628 --> 02:32:17.452]  Here's what you do.net has an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:32:17.452 --> 02:32:23.735]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[02:32:33.419 --> 02:32:35.500]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:37.241]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.241 --> 02:32:39.782]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.782 --> 02:32:44.505]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.505 --> 02:32:48.206]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:48.206 --> 02:32:51.348]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:51.348 --> 02:32:53.229]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:53.229 --> 02:32:55.350]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:11.496 --> 02:33:19.899]  Economics professor Robert Black, one of the chief investigators of the SNLs, is laying out everything our guest is saying and even more.
[02:33:19.899 --> 02:33:28.281]  He says it's criminal conspiracy, top to bottom, that they run all the regulators, they control the entire system, these big banks and brokerage firms.
[02:33:28.962 --> 02:33:36.892]  They're going to destroy our society if we don't stop them, and that the fraud we've seen is by an order of magnitude the greatest in history.
[02:33:36.892 --> 02:33:43.000]  Those are quotes from Fall of the Republic, the new DVD film we just released two weeks ago, or less than two weeks ago.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.802]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:33:46.504 --> 02:34:00.032]  We have John Perkins in there, Webster Tarpley, a doctor of economics, and also a doctor of history, all agreeing with the same documents, same material, and that's only 45 minutes of the two-hour, 24-minute film.
[02:34:00.032 --> 02:34:05.636]  Covers the banking, so people and your friends and family, you can give them the film and
[02:34:06.641 --> 02:34:10.163]  They can really understand what's going on in this world because this affects everybody.
[02:34:10.163 --> 02:34:12.345]  It doesn't matter if you own a stock or a bond.
[02:34:12.345 --> 02:34:13.706]  This affects your retirement.
[02:34:13.706 --> 02:34:15.247]  It affects your taxes.
[02:34:15.247 --> 02:34:18.909]  And the same system is still there.
[02:34:18.909 --> 02:34:21.931]  The same people that ran all this are still in positions of power.
[02:34:21.931 --> 02:34:24.713]  They control both the major parties.
[02:34:25.976 --> 02:34:27.337]  It's just getting worse and worse.
[02:34:27.337 --> 02:34:29.938]  Greg Gordon has written three parts that I see in the series.
[02:34:29.938 --> 02:34:31.079]  There may be more.
[02:34:31.079 --> 02:34:32.559]  Hal Goldman secretly bet on the U.S.
[02:34:32.559 --> 02:34:33.680]  housing crash.
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:36.201]  Goldman takes on new role taking away people's homes.
[02:34:36.201 --> 02:34:39.063]  Mystery, why did Goldman stop scrutinizing loans it bought?
[02:34:39.063 --> 02:34:44.585]  I want to briefly, in the ten minutes or less that we have left with our guest today, go over some of that.
[02:34:44.585 --> 02:34:49.608]  We'll give you the latest on the shootings around the country, unfortunately, in Florida and Texas.
[02:34:49.608 --> 02:34:50.849]  Some new developments there.
[02:34:50.849 --> 02:34:53.190]  Okay, going back to Greg Gordon.
[02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:55.571]  Greg, you were trying to say something as we went to break.
[02:34:55.991 --> 02:35:08.747]  I was just going to mention that the Wall Street firms, as you would expect them to do, hired contractors to look over pools of mortgages before they were actually purchased.
[02:35:08.747 --> 02:35:12.772]  And it's very interesting what happened here.
[02:35:12.772 --> 02:35:15.075]  I've managed to find some of the people who
[02:35:16.036 --> 02:35:40.397]  We're looking over these loans, including a former project manager who would not be identified for fear it would ruin his career, who said that he watched as the number of loans that were reviewed in each pool, the percentage of loans, declined steadily from really 100% at the beginning to 10% or less at the end.
[02:35:40.397 --> 02:35:44.020]  So they weren't looking at but a small sample of the loans at the end.
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:48.821]  Then, you had the problem of the reviewers.
[02:35:48.821 --> 02:35:56.883]  Some of these people were very experienced, had been in the lending business for 10, 20 years, and they'd look at a loan and they'd say, hey, this person is a landscaper making $10,000.
[02:35:56.883 --> 02:36:05.585]  This person is a hairdresser claiming $10,000 a month, and this person here is a checker at Walmart claiming $5,000 a month in income, and they're getting these big loans.
[02:36:14.207 --> 02:36:15.727]  But how do you justify this?
[02:36:15.727 --> 02:36:18.508]  We have to stop this loan because this is not legit.
[02:36:18.508 --> 02:36:23.490]  And they'd be told, no, we have to follow the guidelines of the mortgage lender.
[02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:30.112]  And this mortgage lender, this particular kind of loan, is what's known as a stated income loan.
[02:36:30.112 --> 02:36:33.633]  The stated income loan became known later on as a liar's loan.
[02:36:34.153 --> 02:36:40.999]  There was no verification of the credit qualifications.
[02:36:40.999 --> 02:36:43.320]  So we had fraud engineered into the system.
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:44.762]  So here's the issue.
[02:36:44.762 --> 02:36:46.323]  We see Madoff go to jail.
[02:36:46.323 --> 02:36:49.425]  We see Ken Lay get convicted.
[02:36:49.425 --> 02:37:00.454]  But looking at this, it seems as if their crimes are smaller, diminutive, or dwarfed by these bigger institutional hedged frauds where they all kind of
[02:37:01.229 --> 02:37:17.559]  You know, pass on the guilt to each other, and then everyone just acts stupid, and there's no Kingpin Madoff or Ken Lay, but in the aggregate, it's galaxies bigger, and you can't get rid of these people.
[02:37:17.559 --> 02:37:18.980]  They run the system still.
[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:22.262]  I mean, are we just drifting towards destruction?
[02:37:23.456 --> 02:37:39.330]  Well, I don't know whether we're drifting towards destruction, but it's clear that this was a chain of profit that began from a real estate agent through the appraiser, the mortgage broker, the mortgage lender, the securitizer, and the
[02:37:40.771 --> 02:37:41.652]  So they're the kingpins.
[02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:43.334]  So the buck stops with the regulators?
[02:38:03.867 --> 02:38:05.128]  We'll see.
[02:38:05.128 --> 02:38:12.774]  I'm not going to make any predictions what the regulators are going to do, not after the Madoff case.
[02:38:12.774 --> 02:38:19.939]  We'll see whether they are willing to go in there and subpoena Goldman Sachs to find out exactly what bets and what
[02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:29.566]  The chronology was the timing of all these secret bets and what they were and what people knew.
[02:38:29.566 --> 02:38:34.509]  Most important, perhaps, probably, what did people know while they were making the secret bets?
[02:38:34.509 --> 02:38:42.675]  Did they know they were peddling toxic waste and they needed to insure themselves and that's why they bought $20 billion in insurance-like bets with AIG?
[02:38:42.675 --> 02:38:49.780]  Or was this just, as Goldman Sachs would put it, were they just positioning, repositioning their portfolio?
[02:38:53.084 --> 02:39:01.688]  It's just mind-blowing to see something like this at this magnitude going on, and no one's been brought to justice to add insult to injury.
[02:39:01.688 --> 02:39:08.351]  Record profits for Goldman Sachs, record bonuses, and it's going on at these other big firms.
[02:39:08.351 --> 02:39:20.697]  Bonuses at AIG, bonuses at JP Morgan, bonuses all around, while the real economy goes belly-up and unemployment skyrockets.
[02:39:20.697 --> 02:39:21.197]  That's correct.
[02:39:22.241 --> 02:39:25.743]  Well, we'll have to see whether we get an investigation.
[02:39:25.743 --> 02:39:38.730]  You asked me before about what Goldman is doing now, and it is interesting and sad to note that like the other Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs, this 24-carat Wall Street firm,
[02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:41.931]  Well, it's a predatory vertical integration of the economy.
[02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.190]  I don't
[02:40:25.121 --> 02:40:26.602]  And so it paid off.
[02:40:26.602 --> 02:40:28.463]  I mean, it looks like this paid.
[02:40:28.463 --> 02:40:33.466]  Looks like, you know, why did that famous gangster rob banks?
[02:40:33.466 --> 02:40:35.106]  Because that's where the money was.
[02:40:35.106 --> 02:40:37.828]  And I guess nobody will even point the finger at him, and so they'll...
[02:40:39.614 --> 02:40:40.515]  I mean, I guess that's it.
[02:40:40.515 --> 02:40:41.355]  They win.
[02:40:41.355 --> 02:40:45.738]  Let's say this, in fairness.
[02:40:45.738 --> 02:40:55.264]  Nobody's feeling terribly fair toward Goldman, wanting to be terribly fair toward Goldman Sachs because they're making so much money in this horrible climate right now, economic climate.
[02:40:55.264 --> 02:40:59.147]  But Goldman, this is not the only market Goldman was in.
[02:40:59.147 --> 02:41:00.227]  And they're very smart.
[02:41:00.227 --> 02:41:03.690]  They get the best and the brightest out of Ivy League schools, and they're very smart.
[02:41:03.690 --> 02:41:05.431]  They make a lot of money in a lot of places.
[02:41:06.031 --> 02:41:14.153]  What's drawing our attention is just the fact that Goldman wasn't a small player and they got out.
[02:41:14.153 --> 02:41:18.934]  They made it out safely and nobody else really did.
[02:41:18.934 --> 02:41:20.774]  And they just so happen to have all the regulators.
[02:41:20.774 --> 02:41:22.215]  Well, amazing.
[02:41:22.215 --> 02:41:32.297]  And now they're running around, you've got an investigative report on that, one of the most aggressive groups, correct me if I'm wrong, going after people's houses.
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:35.302]  Well, there was a disturbing example.
[02:41:35.302 --> 02:41:51.000]  A couple named Tony and Celia Becker from San Jose had a 1,500 square foot house and they took a couple of mortgages out to support a jewelry business that had been hit with wildfires and other things that happened in California.
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:52.541]  I think so.
[02:42:07.006 --> 02:42:15.477]  And so they've discovered a clause in the mortgage that allowed them to negotiate to defer some of the loan payments.
[02:42:15.477 --> 02:42:19.943]  And they needed to negotiate with their lender to get this deferral.
[02:42:19.943 --> 02:42:22.506]  The only problem was nobody would admit to being the lender.
[02:42:23.247 --> 02:42:34.030]  Goldman had bought the mortgages from a subprime lender and denied that it owned the mortgages, which might have been technically true because they were stuck in the trust at the time, but they knew where they were.
[02:42:34.030 --> 02:42:44.993]  And this couple wrote a letter to Goldman's chairman, none other than Henry Paulson, at the time, 2003, and it took three years before sort of an obscure
[02:42:45.573 --> 02:42:51.779]  Goldman's subsidiary acknowledged at a court hearing that, yes, Goldman held their mortgage.
[02:42:51.779 --> 02:42:58.304]  And then it took another three years until just a couple months ago, they finally got a concession from Goldman.
[02:42:58.304 --> 02:43:01.207]  Goldman gave them a new mortgage at 5% interest.
[02:43:01.207 --> 02:43:09.594]  Now, this couple, it was a novel case because they had some claims, some investment loss claims against Goldman and some other Wall Street firms, and Goldman settled up with them.
[02:43:09.594 --> 02:43:11.316]  But the question is, how could Goldman
[02:43:13.077 --> 02:43:17.339]  Yeah, how can you?
[02:43:17.339 --> 02:43:30.126]  Well, I mean, I've got a mortgage, and over the years it's been sold, I think, five times, and then I would have them threatening me over escrow money, and I'd say, I paid that bank, and then they wouldn't say who bought it.
[02:43:30.126 --> 02:43:32.207]  Well, another company now has it.
[02:43:32.207 --> 02:43:33.608]  Send your check here.
[02:43:33.608 --> 02:43:35.249]  Send your check there.
[02:43:35.249 --> 02:43:36.770]  Make your wireless payment here.
[02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:37.930]  Make your wireless payment there.
[02:43:37.930 --> 02:43:39.351]  And then I read about
[02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:50.116]  It's been on CNN where people actually own a house, but then they say paperwork wasn't filed right, and so banks come in and start repossessing.
[02:43:50.116 --> 02:43:53.138]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:43:53.138 --> 02:43:54.459]  It's a very common problem.
[02:43:54.459 --> 02:44:02.224]  A lot of these Wall Street firms did not always file papers with the local registrar of deeds.
[02:44:02.224 --> 02:44:06.507]  It's called an assignment of mortgage, and it makes clear who the mortgage holder is.
[02:44:06.507 --> 02:44:09.469]  And a lot of times they didn't file these papers properly.
[02:44:10.470 --> 02:44:18.116]  Many people, when they try to modify their mortgage or refinance or whatever, they run into all kinds of problems because they can't figure out, you know, the title companies.
[02:44:18.116 --> 02:44:20.818]  They want to know who has the mortgage.
[02:44:20.818 --> 02:44:21.699]  Who are we paying off?
[02:44:21.699 --> 02:44:26.483]  How are they going to get a payoff figure if they can't even figure out who owns the mortgage?
[02:44:26.483 --> 02:44:31.547]  And it just goes on and on and on, and instead of more transparency, it looks like we're
[02:44:32.059 --> 02:44:33.380]  Looks like we're getting less.
[02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:38.582]  Well, I guess we're going to see more in this series, or are you done writing about Goldman Sachs for now?
[02:44:38.582 --> 02:44:41.062]  We've got a lot of leads in response to this series.
[02:44:41.062 --> 02:44:44.444]  We'll see if any of them turn fruitful.
[02:44:44.444 --> 02:44:48.625]  I'm following a number of them right now, trying to see where they go.
[02:44:48.625 --> 02:44:52.507]  We'll see if we can gin up some good follow stories.
[02:44:53.195 --> 02:45:01.741]  Okay, Greg Gordon with McClatchy Newspapers, award-winning investigative journalist, and I mean award-winning, breaking so many important and seminal news stories.
[02:45:01.741 --> 02:45:03.322]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:45:03.322 --> 02:45:04.683]  We've been honored.
[02:45:04.683 --> 02:45:05.243]  Same here.
[02:45:05.243 --> 02:45:06.724]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:45:06.724 --> 02:45:07.104]  Thank you.
[02:45:07.104 --> 02:45:07.525]  Take care.
[02:45:07.525 --> 02:45:08.605]  There he goes.
[02:45:08.605 --> 02:45:11.987]  I'm gonna take some final calls here at the end of the show and get into the shooting news.
[02:45:11.987 --> 02:45:15.910]  They're still chasing the guy around in Florida.
[02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:16.831]  We've got his name.
[02:45:16.831 --> 02:45:18.652]  It's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:45:18.652 --> 02:45:21.153]  Reportedly blasted eight people.
[02:45:21.153 --> 02:45:21.674]  You've got this
[02:45:22.711 --> 02:45:26.534]  Well, she's guaranteed to be a Prozac head psychiatrist at Fort Hood.
[02:45:26.534 --> 02:45:29.636]  They're trying to spin into terrorism.
[02:45:29.636 --> 02:45:30.797]  It could be that.
[02:45:30.797 --> 02:45:32.459]  Could be a staged event.
[02:45:32.459 --> 02:45:34.861]  We'll find out later, as Bob Chapman said.
[02:45:34.861 --> 02:45:41.346]  It is too early right now for me to sit here and tell you that I have any idea what's going on.
[02:45:41.346 --> 02:45:43.507]  I'll tell you this, it stinks to high heaven.
[02:45:43.507 --> 02:45:49.532]  My nose is rarely wrong.
[02:45:49.532 --> 02:45:51.874]  And it's telling me that this stinks bad.
[02:45:52.315 --> 02:46:09.307]  And if we keep seeing more shootings, and they turn out to be on drugs, or turn out to be army psychiatrists, or... It's just very, very suspicious right now, and we are looking at that in detail.
[02:46:09.307 --> 02:46:13.230]  Meanwhile, we've got distractions in and around this story.
[02:46:13.230 --> 02:46:20.255]  The big talk on the fake conservative stations, you know, they don't want to talk about the Global Carbon Tax Treaty, they don't want to talk about
[02:46:21.693 --> 02:46:29.637]  All the really serious issues, or how the Republicans are in bed with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and the private Federal Reserve just as much as Obama.
[02:46:29.637 --> 02:46:35.499]  No, they're all, oh, we're the conservatives, we'll be back in power in the next year and a half in Congress and we'll fix it all.
[02:46:35.499 --> 02:46:38.981]  Yeah, let's see if that happens when they get in.
[02:46:38.981 --> 02:46:41.722]  Just like, we'll see if it happens when Obama got in.
[02:46:41.722 --> 02:46:50.306]  And then when I'm attacking the Republican Congress in a year and a half when they get control of the House, which they're probably going to do, I'll be called a commie again.
[02:46:51.104 --> 02:46:59.007]  I'm being called a right-wing extremist right now because I don't like the political whore that reads off a teleprompter who's Barack Obama.
[02:46:59.007 --> 02:47:00.987]  No, I'm a constitutionalist.
[02:47:00.987 --> 02:47:02.148]  I'm a truth teller.
[02:47:02.148 --> 02:47:11.411]  I'm somebody that just tells the truth, lets the chips fall where they may, we make a mistake, we admit it, we're right, we trumpet it, we're here.
[02:47:11.411 --> 02:47:18.333]  You can judge us by our track record, by the fruits of what we produce, what we create, what we do.
[02:47:18.333 --> 02:47:18.753]  But this
[02:47:20.490 --> 02:47:28.876]  Indignation of the citizenry getting mad, having their political angers dissipated like a steam valve on ridiculous crap.
[02:47:28.876 --> 02:47:36.062]  Obama's giving a speech yesterday, they load his teleprompter, I've gone and pulled the video up, with prepared remarks.
[02:47:37.188 --> 02:47:48.911]  He reads off the... I'm not defending Obama, but I'm not going to spend all day on some puppet and ask the listeners, what do you think of Obama not caring about the troops?
[02:47:48.911 --> 02:47:53.232]  What do you think of Obama being disrespectful to him?
[02:47:53.232 --> 02:47:55.752]  That's a mind game the media is playing with you.
[02:47:55.752 --> 02:48:02.834]  This guy gets up there, reads off a teleprompter, says, oh, our hearts go out to everybody who was hurt.
[02:48:03.871 --> 02:48:14.935]  You know, after he thanks the Congressional Medal of Honor winner and thanks the people that are there, two minutes in, he talks about the shooting as if he's the president, as if he's running anything.
[02:48:14.935 --> 02:48:20.556]  It's all about, it's Obama, and everything stops with Obama, and Obama really runs things.
[02:48:20.556 --> 02:48:31.720]  That way, in three to seven years, whenever he leaves office, whether he's one term or two, it can all be blamed on him.
[02:48:32.443 --> 02:48:35.145]  And then we'll get another fake right winger.
[02:48:35.145 --> 02:48:38.107]  And then in four to eight years, it can all be blamed on him again.
[02:48:38.107 --> 02:48:40.108]  And then we'll get another Democrat.
[02:48:40.108 --> 02:48:46.552]  And then we can build them up and tear them down and make it all about how they're making the decision.
[02:48:46.552 --> 02:48:51.155]  Obama's making the decision on whether to increase troops in Afghanistan.
[02:48:51.155 --> 02:48:53.456]  They've already sent in two groups of troops.
[02:48:53.456 --> 02:48:54.197]  They've increased it.
[02:48:55.026 --> 02:48:56.907]  Right at 40,000 more.
[02:48:56.907 --> 02:48:58.487]  But they make it all about a debate.
[02:48:58.487 --> 02:48:59.948]  Will there be more after that?
[02:48:59.948 --> 02:49:02.029]  And what decision will he make?
[02:49:02.029 --> 02:49:03.869]  Will he make the right decision?
[02:49:03.869 --> 02:49:07.911]  It's just all a big theater game.
[02:49:07.911 --> 02:49:09.431]  No doubt about it.
[02:49:09.431 --> 02:49:14.773]  It means nothing.
[02:49:14.773 --> 02:49:18.815]  It means absolutely nothing.
[02:49:18.815 --> 02:49:24.257]  Did the media make a big deal about it when Obama's controllers six months ago wanted to make veterans pay for their own medical care?
[02:49:26.631 --> 02:49:28.173]  No.
[02:49:28.173 --> 02:49:31.996]  Because the establishment doesn't care about the veterans, they're scared of the veterans.
[02:49:31.996 --> 02:49:33.517]  They don't like you.
[02:49:33.517 --> 02:49:36.219]  They use fake patriotism to control you.
[02:49:36.219 --> 02:49:39.022]  That's why they're banning a lot of veterans from owning guns.
[02:49:39.022 --> 02:49:40.463]  Are veterans with guns dangerous?
[02:49:40.463 --> 02:49:41.964]  You bet they are.
[02:49:41.964 --> 02:49:45.387]  Some are dangerous to criminals, some are dangerous to their wives and kids.
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:50.692]  That's just the way it is to be an empire, with a bunch of trained killers coming back and living amongst us.
[02:49:51.573 --> 02:49:58.521]  You don't take my guns because a bunch of trained killers may go crazy at any minute.
[02:49:58.521 --> 02:50:07.230]  And you sure don't blame the whole military because a small percentage of them are gonna go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs and fly over the cuckoo nest.
[02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:09.112]  That's why I've got my guns.
[02:50:09.112 --> 02:50:13.577]  Some crazy vet goes running around trying to shoot a bunch of people, I'm gonna go out and deal with them.
[02:50:15.265 --> 02:50:16.986]  It's not because I'm macho or tough, folks.
[02:50:16.986 --> 02:50:18.367]  It's what you're supposed to do!
[02:50:18.367 --> 02:50:21.490]  I don't know how they turned this country into a bunch of cowards.
[02:50:21.490 --> 02:50:27.935]  And how it's amazing that this female cop went and shot this reported lunatic four times, didn't kill him.
[02:50:27.935 --> 02:50:29.796]  They said he killed him for six hours.
[02:50:29.796 --> 02:50:32.898]  And they're all marveling that a cop would just run in and shoot somebody.
[02:50:32.898 --> 02:50:36.021]  What do you think cops did 20, 30 years ago?
[02:50:36.021 --> 02:50:40.704]  They didn't need all the gear and all the crap.
[02:50:40.704 --> 02:50:42.946]  But a woman is now tougher than the average cop.
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:46.803]  And I just don't even know what to say about it anymore.
[02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:56.212]  Again, it makes my head spin that at every other major shooting, two, three, four hours, they make the cops wait while the shooter runs around killing everybody.
[02:50:56.212 --> 02:51:00.235]  I guess the feds give that order so the kill rate's higher.
[02:51:00.235 --> 02:51:08.563]  Maybe the cops aren't cow- Aerial spray.
[02:51:09.335 --> 02:51:19.521]  Chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[02:51:19.521 --> 02:51:22.603]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[02:51:22.603 --> 02:51:28.027]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[02:51:32.273 --> 02:51:37.016]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[02:51:37.016 --> 02:51:40.899]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[02:51:40.899 --> 02:51:44.801]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[02:51:44.801 --> 02:51:49.945]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[02:51:49.945 --> 02:51:53.107]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:06.498]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.498 --> 02:52:09.745]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.745 --> 02:52:11.167]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.849 --> 02:52:14.552]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.552 --> 02:52:20.918]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.918 --> 02:52:26.463]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.463 --> 02:52:36.112]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.212 --> 02:52:38.553]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.553 --> 02:52:40.153]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.153 --> 02:52:42.614]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.614 --> 02:52:44.735]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.735 --> 02:52:49.877]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:01.072 --> 02:53:02.273]  The once mighty U.S.
[02:53:02.273 --> 02:53:05.294]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[02:53:05.294 --> 02:53:07.975]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[02:53:07.975 --> 02:53:11.157]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[02:53:11.157 --> 02:53:15.439]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[02:53:15.439 --> 02:53:19.541]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[02:53:19.921 --> 02:53:23.543]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[02:53:23.543 --> 02:53:24.783]  Prepare now.
[02:53:24.783 --> 02:53:29.726]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[02:53:29.726 --> 02:53:34.828]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[02:53:40.012 --> 02:53:42.214]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[02:54:10.821 --> 02:54:19.623]  Alright, let's jam in a few final calls here.
[02:54:19.623 --> 02:54:23.123]  I'll be back live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:23.123 --> 02:54:29.825]  Central Standard Time live.
[02:54:29.825 --> 02:54:32.965]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Texas.
[02:54:32.965 --> 02:54:34.526]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:54:34.526 --> 02:54:35.986]  Hi Alex, long time listener here.
[02:54:36.525 --> 02:54:42.147]  I just want to pass on my observations at the official Countdown to Judgment Day Tea Party Tour Rally.
[02:54:42.147 --> 02:54:48.630]  After attending the Abilene Rally this morning and hearing just a few of their host speakers, it appears that the Tea Party movement's been hijacked.
[02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:54.692]  Big money Republican agents who are pushing the pro-military, pro-war agenda of the old Bush neocon regime.
[02:54:54.692 --> 02:54:56.093]  They have speakers promoting U.S.
[02:54:56.093 --> 02:55:03.316]  aggression against radical Islam terror, and the main guy running the Tea Party Tour is pushing his book, which supports the neocon fallacy of a total Islamic attack on 9-11.
[02:55:04.622 --> 02:55:13.787]  The majority of this Abilene crowd does not know your work, and if you mention 9-11 was an inside job, they spit in your face, and they spit in my face today, and consider you an Abominoid.
[02:55:13.787 --> 02:55:21.071]  I made the mistake of passing out terror storm flyers about false flag terror, but these area veterans and local Dias Air Force Base folks can't accept that the U.S.
[02:55:21.071 --> 02:55:22.712]  military has been hijacked.
[02:55:22.712 --> 02:55:28.376]  The Tea Party tour will not have speakers who expose the New World Order and that the elite insiders are behind 9-11.
[02:55:29.947 --> 02:55:35.336]  They demonized Cindy Sheehan and the Abilene crowd booed her when her name was mentioned.
[02:55:35.336 --> 02:55:37.299]  They never speak of the phrase New World Order.
[02:55:37.299 --> 02:55:42.007]  This Tea Party Caravan is headed to Austin at 5 o'clock where you're at today.
[02:55:42.007 --> 02:55:43.169]  You need to be there and push 9-11 Truth.
[02:55:45.629 --> 02:55:46.369]  Absolutely.
[02:55:46.369 --> 02:55:50.411]  I mean, what's happened is, this is what Glenn Beck's for.
[02:55:50.411 --> 02:55:55.172]  He guides and takes the Ron Paul revolution, and he's taken it over.
[02:55:55.172 --> 02:56:03.055]  Only by Ron Paul coming out public, not attacking Beck and others, but stating the true principles, can we take control of it back.
[02:56:03.055 --> 02:56:04.876]  But, I mean, this is why the elite are in power.
[02:56:04.876 --> 02:56:07.117]  They know how to control the left.
[02:56:07.117 --> 02:56:09.898]  Obama was meant to take control of that.
[02:56:09.898 --> 02:56:13.119]  Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh create a fake clone on the right.
[02:56:13.846 --> 02:56:29.056]  Two wings on the same bird, and again, the mainline Tea Party people, there is no New World Order, the carbon tax isn't global government, Glenn Beck a few weeks ago attacked the British Lord that came out and said global government.
[02:56:29.056 --> 02:56:30.777]  I mean, come on, Glenn!
[02:56:30.777 --> 02:56:35.861]  So see, he does that at key points, he admits things that are true, and then goes back on them.
[02:56:37.170 --> 02:56:38.731]  That's why I like Lou Dobbs a lot better.
[02:56:38.731 --> 02:56:45.216]  I mean, he doesn't go as far as back on some issues, but he's consistent and isn't involved in backstabbing that I've seen.
[02:56:45.216 --> 02:56:47.198]  And that's why his house is getting shot up.
[02:56:47.198 --> 02:56:49.819]  But I appreciate your call.
[02:56:49.819 --> 02:56:52.301]  Look, it's not going to matter if they take over the Tea Parties.
[02:56:52.301 --> 02:56:54.563]  People are finding out about world government.
[02:56:54.563 --> 02:56:56.324]  The economy's collapsing.
[02:56:56.324 --> 02:56:59.126]  We're there educating people about the real threat.
[02:56:59.126 --> 02:57:00.527]  The best film to give a
[02:57:01.693 --> 02:57:03.254]  We're good to go.
[02:57:18.635 --> 02:57:23.837]  They're like blind people who've never seen... trying to describe something to them.
[02:57:23.837 --> 02:57:26.238]  They're trying to describe the way the seashore looks.
[02:57:26.238 --> 02:57:27.498]  They've never seen.
[02:57:27.498 --> 02:57:29.199]  They can't interface.
[02:57:29.199 --> 02:57:30.939]  They can't understand.
[02:57:30.939 --> 02:57:34.961]  They can't begin to even realize what we're trying to say to them.
[02:57:34.961 --> 02:57:37.561]  If you just argue with them, they think, You're a liberal!
[02:57:37.561 --> 02:57:38.762]  You're a commie!
[02:57:38.762 --> 02:57:39.742]  Don't give me Mao Zedong!
[02:57:39.742 --> 02:57:43.343]  You know, they don't want to hear Bush triple the size of government.
[02:57:43.343 --> 02:57:45.224]  They want to believe the lie.
[02:57:46.181 --> 02:57:53.464]  But if you say, hey, this film exposes Obama, which it does, but it also exposes Bush and the whole agenda, watch this!
[02:57:53.464 --> 02:57:59.587]  That's why Ted's gonna run some ads on national radio for the neocons, because we need to deprogram these people and the left.
[02:57:59.587 --> 02:58:09.972]  This film is meant to deprogram people in the controlled left-right paradigm who think that inside the box, you know, inside this little contained area, that's the whole world.
[02:58:09.972 --> 02:58:13.994]  We're gonna go, no, look for yourself, it's much bigger!
[02:58:15.177 --> 02:58:17.618]  It's much more sophisticated.
[02:58:17.618 --> 02:58:22.899]  And a lot of them won't wake up now, but they'll wake up later, because this is gonna get really bad.
[02:58:22.899 --> 02:58:28.480]  So again, folks, get Follow the Republic at Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[02:58:52.523 --> 02:58:56.546]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.546 --> 02:58:59.787]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.787 --> 02:59:04.590]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.590 --> 02:59:10.994]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.994 --> 02:59:13.215]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.755 --> 02:59:14.055]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.055 --> 02:59:14.576]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.576 --> 02:59:15.356]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.356 --> 02:59:16.517]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.517 --> 02:59:18.758]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.648 --> 02:59:34.790]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:39.933]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.933 --> 02:59:54.163]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.163 --> 02:59:56.545]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.545 --> 02:59:59.327]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.149 --> 03:00:10.991]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.991 --> 03:00:12.571]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.571 --> 03:00:14.132]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.132 --> 03:00:18.313]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.313 --> 03:00:25.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.476 --> 03:00:28.937]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 45 minutes.
[03:00:28.937 --> 03:00:30.778]  John Ronson joins us.
[03:00:32.043 --> 03:00:40.345]  Coming up, I'm going to play you a little sneak peek from Jesse Ventura's new television show coming up in December and January.
[03:00:40.345 --> 03:00:43.405]  John Ronson is a writer and documentary filmmaker.
[03:00:43.405 --> 03:00:50.847]  His books, Them Adventures with Extremist, that's, I'm in that one, and The Men Who Stare at Goats were international bestsellers.
[03:00:50.847 --> 03:00:57.869]  The Men Who Stare at Goats have been turned into major motion pictures starring George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges.
[03:00:57.869 --> 03:00:59.209]  He also is the author of two
[03:01:00.635 --> 03:01:08.658]  Collections, Out of the Ordinary, True Tales and Everyday Craziness, and What I Do, More True Tales of Everyday Crazies.
[03:01:08.658 --> 03:01:14.061]  He's written the popular Human Zoo and Out of the Ordinary columns for The Guardian, where he still contributes features.
[03:01:14.061 --> 03:01:21.364]  He currently writes and presents to Sony-nominated BBC Radio 4 series John Ronson On.
[03:01:21.364 --> 03:01:29.467]  And he also produced Secret Rulers of the World, a multi-award-winning documentary, five-part documentary that I'm also in.
[03:01:30.293 --> 03:01:40.959]  And his most recent documentaries are Revered Death Channel 4, Citizen Kubrick, and Robbie Williams and John Ronson's Journey to the Other Side, Radio 4.
[03:01:40.959 --> 03:01:47.983]  In the U.S., he is the contributor to Public Radio International's This American Life, JohnRonson.com.
[03:01:47.983 --> 03:01:51.544]  John Ronson joining us via Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:01:51.544 --> 03:01:53.906]  It's good to have you here, John.
[03:01:53.906 --> 03:01:54.326]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:54.326 --> 03:01:56.687]  It's good to hear from you again.
[03:01:56.687 --> 03:01:57.948]  Where are you joining us from?
[03:01:58.903 --> 03:02:00.385]  I am joining you from London.
[03:02:00.385 --> 03:02:08.033]  I'm a bit, I'm a bit trepidatious about this interview because I'm always worried about where it's gonna go, but I'm gonna, but it's great to hear from you again.
[03:02:08.033 --> 03:02:10.877]  You know, we had this amazing adventure, what, when was it?
[03:02:10.877 --> 03:02:14.621]  Back in the year 2000, where we snuck into Bohemian Grove together.
[03:02:15.330 --> 03:02:26.681]  Yes, yes, and then I wasn't supposed to talk about how you later went in there for liability purposes, and then people asked me later, well why is John Ronson saying he also snuck in?
[03:02:26.681 --> 03:02:41.114]  So they thought that, I guess that's a journalistic issue of you guys snuck in later that day, that evening after I went in, and then I wasn't supposed to talk about that, and then later you did talk about that, and that became quite a big question out there for people.
[03:02:41.914 --> 03:02:52.718]  Yeah, no, I was worried at the time, speaking completely frankly, that if I admitted that I snuck in and trespassed, we might have trouble getting our documentary on television.
[03:02:52.718 --> 03:02:55.640]  Yeah, because of the way that we, you know, went about gathering the material.
[03:02:55.640 --> 03:02:58.281]  So I just kind of kept quiet about it.
[03:02:58.281 --> 03:03:02.242]  But then when my book came out, when them came out, I did admit going in.
[03:03:02.242 --> 03:03:03.323]  But of course, to this day,
[03:03:03.993 --> 03:03:08.434]  To this day, there's loads of people who think that I didn't go into Bohemian Grove and I faked the whole thing.
[03:03:08.434 --> 03:03:12.036]  You know, including people on Prison Planet, you know, on the forum and so on.
[03:03:12.036 --> 03:03:19.218]  Well, don't feel bad, John, because people think I, A, didn't sneak in, or B, that they let us in.
[03:03:19.218 --> 03:03:20.558]  But no, we did indeed.
[03:03:20.558 --> 03:03:25.620]  I separately snuck in, then later that day, you reportedly snuck in there.
[03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:28.921]  And I did see you about 100 yards away and wave at you.
[03:03:29.679 --> 03:03:30.479]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:30.479 --> 03:03:39.544]  In fact, we walked past each other when we were surrounded by all that kind of strange, devil-y iconography and all those kind of, you know, owl sculptures.
[03:03:39.544 --> 03:03:44.086]  And, you know, we walked past each other basically, you know, just keep walking, just keep walking.
[03:03:44.086 --> 03:03:45.087]  It was a mad night.
[03:03:45.087 --> 03:03:50.350]  I still look back on that as being one of the, probably the strangest nights of my life.
[03:03:50.350 --> 03:03:52.451]  And one of the most enjoyable.
[03:03:52.451 --> 03:03:56.853]  Well, I think one of the big issues here is folks can't believe that
[03:03:58.052 --> 03:04:01.953]  I was able to sneak in and shoot that footage that you use in your television program.
[03:04:01.953 --> 03:04:04.754]  Because so many other people got caught, got busted.
[03:04:04.754 --> 03:04:13.517]  But every time you read about a CBS News reporter, or a People Magazine reporter, or Vanity Fair, they walk up to people and start asking reporter questions.
[03:04:13.517 --> 03:04:14.857]  What do they think's gonna happen?
[03:04:16.783 --> 03:04:27.612]  There's a weirdness though to us getting in because we both knew that in the days preceding our arrival, there were kind of FBI guys all over the local town and so on.
[03:04:27.612 --> 03:04:30.674]  But by the time we arrived, they'd all cleaned out.
[03:04:30.674 --> 03:04:32.416]  And we did, we just walked in very easily.
[03:04:32.416 --> 03:04:37.920]  I walked up the drive, giving the security guard a kind of I rule the world wave, you know, wearing preppy clothes.
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:42.105]  And he went in through the undergrowth, but we both got in incredibly easily.
[03:04:42.105 --> 03:04:49.293]  My guess is that these days, you know, since your documentary and my book and documentary, it's going to be a lot harder to get into bohemian growth.
[03:04:49.293 --> 03:04:53.778]  But, you know, maybe we spoiled the party for any other... I believe we have.
[03:04:53.778 --> 03:04:56.982]  In fact, they've reported that the security is out the wazoo now.
[03:04:56.982 --> 03:04:58.264]  John Ronson, stay with us.
[03:05:01.209 --> 03:05:10.354]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:05:10.354 --> 03:05:13.716]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:05:13.716 --> 03:05:19.599]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:05:19.599 --> 03:05:24.362]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:05:24.362 --> 03:05:26.723]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:05:26.983 --> 03:05:27.363]  I'm good.
[03:05:43.592 --> 03:05:43.812]  I think so.
[03:06:01.806 --> 03:06:04.808]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.808 --> 03:06:10.130]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:10.130 --> 03:06:12.191]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:12.191 --> 03:06:17.194]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:17.194 --> 03:06:18.375]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.375 --> 03:06:19.495]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.495 --> 03:06:21.376]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.376 --> 03:06:22.457]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.457 --> 03:06:24.658]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.658 --> 03:06:25.999]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.999 --> 03:06:27.519]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.519 --> 03:06:28.580]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:06:28.740 --> 03:06:30.061]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:06:30.061 --> 03:06:32.784]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.784 --> 03:06:36.367]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.367 --> 03:06:40.191]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:40.191 --> 03:06:41.432]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.432 --> 03:06:42.313]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.313 --> 03:06:43.414]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.414 --> 03:06:44.355]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.355 --> 03:06:45.176]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.436 --> 03:06:48.500]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:07:04.900 --> 03:07:07.783]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:07:07.783 --> 03:07:09.045]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:07:09.045 --> 03:07:09.866]  It's very real.
[03:07:09.866 --> 03:07:12.109]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:07:12.109 --> 03:07:13.771]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:07:13.771 --> 03:07:18.077]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:08:02.452 --> 03:08:07.977]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.254 --> 03:08:15.657]  John Ronson is our guest.
[03:08:15.657 --> 03:08:17.439]  Documentary filmmaker.
[03:08:17.439 --> 03:08:19.021]  Worldwide best-selling author.
[03:08:19.021 --> 03:08:23.948]  Both of his best-selling books got option to make films.
[03:08:23.948 --> 03:08:27.172]  One of them, Men Who Stare at Goats, is now in theaters.
[03:08:27.172 --> 03:08:30.256]  One of the number one movies out there in the world.
[03:08:30.256 --> 03:08:31.077]  It's in the top three.
[03:08:32.842 --> 03:08:40.850]  The second book, the first in the series, Them, that I'm a big part of, got optioned to be turned into a movie, and that's probably still gonna happen.
[03:08:40.850 --> 03:08:44.914]  We will talk to John Ronson about that before he leaves us.
[03:08:44.914 --> 03:08:50.539]  But for stations that just joined us on the radio, he's also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:08:50.539 --> 03:08:52.141]  For the viewers joining us from London,
[03:08:53.012 --> 03:08:56.215]  During the break, we were talking about Bohemian Grove.
[03:08:56.215 --> 03:09:04.103]  He's getting interviewed for Jesse Ventura's TV show, one of the last interviews they're doing on Skull & Bones, on Bohemian Grove, on Bilderberg.
[03:09:04.728 --> 03:09:10.730]  Uh, because he has a differing view than I do, but not that big of a view, uh, change.
[03:09:10.730 --> 03:09:22.555]  Uh, you know, the thing we really agree on is, you know, I thought what I saw was kind of stupid, and you thought what we saw inside Bohemian Grove was, you know, proof of Satanism and so on, and I didn't.
[03:09:22.555 --> 03:09:30.758]  But what we agree on is that the participants in the ritual at Bohemian Grove seem to take it really seriously, and that's a really interesting question.
[03:09:32.290 --> 03:09:38.837]  Yes, you were there in the crowd as they were engaging in the mock human sacrifice, the effigy of a boy.
[03:09:38.837 --> 03:09:45.183]  And, I mean, were the old men not grinding their teeth and making sexual pleasure noises?
[03:09:45.183 --> 03:09:47.846]  Were they not in a raptured state?
[03:09:49.439 --> 03:10:04.547]  Well they did seem to, I don't know if I used those exact words, I didn't think had a sexual pleasure or so, but they did seem to be like really into it, you know, like really intense about it and you noticed that and I noticed that and
[03:10:05.827 --> 03:10:12.271]  And it was strange that I came away thinking, you know, frankly, that I was the most sane person in the entire Redwood Forest.
[03:10:12.271 --> 03:10:22.797]  Because I didn't agree with you and Mike's interpretation of the ceremony, but also I could see that, you know, the participants were taking it just as seriously as you were.
[03:10:22.797 --> 03:10:24.478]  And I did find that very odd.
[03:10:24.478 --> 03:10:28.440]  And in fact, that was the kind of germ of the idea, you know, this idea of kind of
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:51.595]  Bubbles of craziness at the hearse of power that eventually led on to me writing The Menace Day at Goats You know really The Menace Day at Goats was kind of began to form in my mind that nice when we were at Bohemian Grove Well, I mean from from from meeting you out at Waco more than 10 years ago to today I've seen you in BBC and CNN interviews and
[03:10:52.609 --> 03:11:05.497]  That you've changed your views, because ten years ago you'd laugh, there was no global government, there was no secret room, there wasn't a plan, and then three or four years later I'd see you say, no there really is a Bilderberg Group, they really do want a world government.
[03:11:07.128 --> 03:11:11.972]  But you can differ on what their plans are or argue about are they really in control.
[03:11:11.972 --> 03:11:19.800]  Now they're openly announcing a global carbon tax, a world government, we're going to pay our taxes to a private bank of the world.
[03:11:19.800 --> 03:11:22.142]  They have the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[03:11:22.142 --> 03:11:29.849]  They're saying Al Gore is a prophet and that his new movie is about how it's a global religion of the earth.
[03:11:30.679 --> 03:11:33.389]  And, uh, I mean, John, a lot has changed.
[03:11:33.389 --> 03:11:35.798]  What's your view now on the New World Order?
[03:11:35.798 --> 03:11:36.861]  Does it still not exist?
[03:11:37.708 --> 03:11:44.092]  Well, I mean, what you're saying now about kind of what stuff might have leaked out of, you know, recent Bilderberg meetings, I don't know.
[03:11:44.092 --> 03:11:49.054]  I've not read the minutes of the last few years' meetings, so I can't comment on that.
[03:11:49.054 --> 03:12:01.561]  But the reason why I said that I felt that, you know, their agenda was to an extent a creation of world government is because that's what one of the founding members of the Bilderberg group said to me on the record.
[03:12:01.801 --> 03:12:07.485]  It was Dennis Healey, Lord Healey, who was one of the first people to set up Bilderberg.
[03:12:07.485 --> 03:12:14.870]  And he said, to say that we were striving for a world government is exaggerated but not wholly unfair.
[03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:16.531]  Those are his actual words.
[03:12:16.531 --> 03:12:19.293]  He said, because basically, you know, Bilderberg was set up
[03:12:19.853 --> 03:12:27.939]  Post-Second World War and they saw that, you know, the last thing the world needed was a politician who was too much of an ideologue.
[03:12:27.939 --> 03:12:37.707]  You know, they didn't want any more Hitlers, so they kind of figured a world government where politics wasn't really in the hands of politicians, it was much more about the flow of capital.
[03:12:37.707 --> 03:12:44.071]  You know, that seemed to have been the reason why Bilderberg as a kind of centrist, globalist thing was set up.
[03:12:44.071 --> 03:12:47.334]  So yeah, so there we are not in disagreement either.
[03:12:47.734 --> 03:13:03.102]  But John, I mean the mainstream media still out of one side of their mouth says there's no such thing as a world government and then out of the other side of their mouth they say yes it's a great thing and it's going to be non-democratic and authoritarian because we the wise men know best i.e.
[03:13:03.102 --> 03:13:06.964]  Financial Times of London headline and now for world government.
[03:13:06.964 --> 03:13:12.506]  I mean here is the New York Times two weeks ago Ban Ki-moon and it says Ban Ki-moon
[03:13:15.459 --> 03:13:26.683]  Again, is the author of this and he went on to say in the article that global government is what we need.
[03:13:26.683 --> 03:13:34.667]  He goes on in the article to say one world government is what we need and that carbon taxes will be the funding mechanism for this.
[03:13:34.667 --> 03:13:36.087]  I mean, this is authoritarian.
[03:13:36.087 --> 03:13:37.628]  This is unelected.
[03:13:37.628 --> 03:13:43.130]  This system is not democratic and you find out the very same wise men that created Hitler
[03:13:44.017 --> 03:13:50.904]  And created Mussolini are the very wise men that created Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein or their sons did.
[03:13:52.354 --> 03:14:01.197]  Well, my theory about Bilderberg is that their vision back in the early 1950s, post the Second World War, was in their minds quite idealistic.
[03:14:01.197 --> 03:14:16.002]  They thought that a safer way of running the world, having just lived through Mussolini and Hitler, a safer way would be to de-ideologue the politicians and to put power in the hands of business.
[03:14:16.002 --> 03:14:19.823]  Because businessmen only care about the flow of money, they don't care about
[03:14:20.618 --> 03:14:25.240]  Well, have you read where it's been declassified now that Hitler was on MI5 payroll and so was Mussolini?
[03:14:44.838 --> 03:14:46.359]  I don't know anything about that.
[03:14:46.359 --> 03:14:49.082]  I can't comment on that because I know nothing about it.
[03:14:49.082 --> 03:14:51.224]  I'd be interested in reading the link.
[03:14:51.224 --> 03:14:55.027]  Yeah, that's London Guardian, which you write for, Times of London.
[03:14:55.027 --> 03:15:01.533]  I mean, we already knew this from Milner Group declassified documents.
[03:15:01.533 --> 03:15:03.675]  But yeah, no.
[03:15:03.675 --> 03:15:06.197]  Well, I mean, you know about Edward VIII being a Nazi, right?
[03:15:07.401 --> 03:15:25.101]  Well, yeah, I mean, there's no question that a whole load of the, you know, ruling gentry of Britain during the rise of the Nazi party, you know, loved the Nazis and they were constantly inviting the Nazis out for the British ruling classes and, you know, putting them up for tea and, you know, there's a wonderful novel about that called The Remains of the Day.
[03:15:25.101 --> 03:15:27.604]  So, you know, there's no question that that was going on.
[03:15:28.184 --> 03:15:29.245]  Uh, you know, the McPherds.
[03:15:29.245 --> 03:15:30.886]  I can't remember which McPherders it was in.
[03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:57.809]  So this corporate group of bankers that set up Bilderberg, Prince Bernhard the Nazi and all the rest of them, this is all a big giant joke.
[03:15:57.809 --> 03:16:01.052]  I mean, you know about Prince Philip and all his calls for eugenics.
[03:16:01.052 --> 03:16:03.674]  I mean, you've certainly heard those statements.
[03:16:03.674 --> 03:16:10.801]  I mean, have you read the White House Science Czar's own publication, Ecoscience, calling for putting poison in the water to sterilize us?
[03:16:10.801 --> 03:16:12.563]  Have you seen this, John?
[03:16:12.563 --> 03:16:13.764]  I know nothing about that.
[03:16:15.903 --> 03:16:25.830]  And also, you know, I firmly believe that, you know, we know that some of the founders of the Bilderberg Group, you know, did have Nazi ties.
[03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:26.331]  I think it was...
[03:16:27.486 --> 03:16:30.267]  I think it was Prince Bernard.
[03:16:30.267 --> 03:16:31.727]  Was it Joseph Rettinger as well?
[03:16:31.727 --> 03:16:32.828]  Yes, yes.
[03:16:32.828 --> 03:16:39.950]  But my personal view, and you know this is the kind of non-conspiratorial view, is that that's not an important fact.
[03:16:39.950 --> 03:16:45.372]  And you know the important fact was that these were people who were kind of idealistic globalists.
[03:16:45.372 --> 03:16:49.473]  But hold on, Bilderberg has released 1954 documents from their founding.
[03:16:50.093 --> 03:16:55.917]  After all these years saying they didn't exist where they said we're going to create a European Union We're going to create a global government.
[03:16:55.917 --> 03:17:17.971]  I mean you know this whole time They've been lying about it, and then now at the final moment they spring it on the public Well, that's interesting that would be interesting to read definitely I mean that doesn't surprise me the idea that you know that a single currency and a European Union was kind of high on Bilderberg's agenda back in the 50s that doesn't surprise me at all all right well instead of
[03:17:19.249 --> 03:17:28.935]  Instead of Alex Jones barking questions at John Ronson at JohnRonson.com, let's start getting into the men who stare at goats.
[03:17:28.935 --> 03:17:31.976]  That was the sequel to them, I guess.
[03:17:31.976 --> 03:17:35.838]  International bestseller, in paperback all over the world right now.
[03:17:35.838 --> 03:17:38.640]  The movie is out, doing very well.
[03:17:38.640 --> 03:17:43.583]  What was the research you did on the book, A, and how accurate to the book is the film?
[03:17:44.964 --> 03:17:59.610]  Well, okay, well, I mean, as I said, I think the book really began, even though I didn't realise it, that night when you and I were together in Bohemian Grove, because it did really, you know, you and I couldn't have interpreted, you know, the ritual differently that we saw at Bohemian Grove.
[03:17:59.610 --> 03:18:01.971]  We had a completely different view, but the one thing we agreed
[03:18:02.071 --> 03:18:03.252]  We're good to go.
[03:18:18.684 --> 03:18:25.930]  And so I thought, well, you know, what other weirdness, what other irrationality can be found in the corridors of power?
[03:18:25.930 --> 03:18:31.053]  So the first thing I did was, with my producer John Sergent, was kind of look into remote viewing.
[03:18:31.053 --> 03:18:34.156]  There was something kind of tangible that was out there a little bit.
[03:18:34.156 --> 03:18:41.101]  And post 9-11, I met Yuri Geller, you know, Yuri Geller with the spoon bending and so on.
[03:18:41.101 --> 03:18:44.843]  And he'd always claimed to have been a secret psychic spy working for the CIA.
[03:18:44.843 --> 03:18:47.005]  And kind of nobody believed him because they sort of figured that
[03:18:47.065 --> 03:18:49.926]  The CIA wouldn't do that.
[03:18:49.926 --> 03:18:53.428]  So post 9-11, they thought the CIA was sensible.
[03:18:53.428 --> 03:18:56.809]  You know, we may be nuts, but the CIA is surely sensible.
[03:18:56.809 --> 03:19:08.675]  So post 9-11, I met Yuri Geller and he said to me, he was very mysterious, and finally he took off his dark glasses and he said to me, if you repeat what I'm about to tell you, I will deny it.
[03:19:08.675 --> 03:19:10.156]  And I said, okay.
[03:19:10.156 --> 03:19:14.518]  And he said, I have been reactivated.
[03:19:14.518 --> 03:19:14.978]  And I said,
[03:19:16.514 --> 03:19:18.776]  I'm not going to tell you.
[03:19:18.776 --> 03:19:20.617]  I will tell you just one thing.
[03:19:20.617 --> 03:19:24.721]  The man who reactivated me is called Ron.
[03:19:24.721 --> 03:19:27.183]  So I went off on a journey to try and find
[03:19:27.851 --> 03:19:28.312]  Ron.
[03:19:28.312 --> 03:19:32.015]  And I never found Ron, although I've got suspicion as to who he probably was.
[03:19:32.015 --> 03:19:37.179]  But on the way to find him, Ron, I met... Tell me how long I can go on, because this is the story that can go on for hours.
[03:19:37.179 --> 03:19:38.140]  No, no, I want to hear it!
[03:19:38.140 --> 03:19:39.521]  John Ronson, when we come back.
[03:19:39.521 --> 03:19:45.025]  I mean, obviously, you are the reporter in the big movie out in theatres right now.
[03:19:45.025 --> 03:19:46.927]  Obi-Wan Kenobi plays you.

[03:21:06.668 --> 03:21:09.917]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.917 --> 03:21:11.340]  As we're finishing off this agenda...

[03:21:26.282 --> 03:21:36.268]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.388 --> 03:21:38.750]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:40.331]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.331 --> 03:21:42.793]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.793 --> 03:21:44.914]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.914 --> 03:21:50.078]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:24:12.125 --> 03:24:14.966]  John Ronson joining us from London.
[03:24:14.966 --> 03:24:19.287]  Coming out of the next break, I'm going to play the trailer for The Men Who Stare at Goats.
[03:24:19.287 --> 03:24:32.732]  So you were getting into the story, which is shown in the movie, of where you're meeting with the former Black Ops commander, and he's saying, so you were a psychic soldier, and he says, yes, Jedi warriors.
[03:24:32.732 --> 03:24:34.032]  Please continue, John Ronson.
[03:24:34.713 --> 03:24:45.879]  Yeah, well, basically, what we discovered through our research, that the remote viewers, which I'm sure loads of you listeners know about, you know, the team of psychic spies, were really just a tip of an iceberg.
[03:24:45.879 --> 03:24:49.300]  And the iceberg was mainly this thing called remote influencing.
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:57.725]  And I first got to hear about this when I was in Hawaii, interviewing a man called Glenn Wheaton, who said he was part of a secret unit called Project Jedi.
[03:24:58.425 --> 03:24:59.486]  And I said, what's Project Jedi?
[03:24:59.486 --> 03:25:01.947]  And he said, well, it's a series of levels.
[03:25:01.947 --> 03:25:06.871]  He said, Level 1, teaching the soldier to eat only nuts and grains for a month.
[03:25:06.871 --> 03:25:08.512]  And I said, OK, what was Level 2?
[03:25:08.512 --> 03:25:10.533]  He said, Level 2 was invisibility.
[03:25:10.533 --> 03:25:14.596]  And I said, well, that's quite the leap from Level 1.
[03:25:14.596 --> 03:25:16.057]  And I said, well, actual invisibility?
[03:25:16.057 --> 03:25:17.378]  And he said, well, yes.
[03:25:17.378 --> 03:25:21.941]  But after a while, we adapted it to just trying to find a way of not being seen.
[03:25:21.941 --> 03:25:23.142]  And I said, like camouflage?
[03:25:23.142 --> 03:25:24.342]  And he went, no.
[03:25:24.342 --> 03:25:25.163]  And I said, what was Level 3?
[03:25:25.163 --> 03:25:26.484]  And he said, Level 3 was intuition.
[03:25:27.128 --> 03:25:30.615]  You come to a fork in the road, you go left, you go right, you go right.
[03:25:30.615 --> 03:25:32.058]  And I said, what was level four?
[03:25:32.058 --> 03:25:35.785]  And he said, level four was stopping the heart of a goat.
[03:25:35.785 --> 03:25:38.109]  Just by wanting the goat's heart to stop.
[03:25:39.033 --> 03:26:00.938]  So really it was this one interview with Glenn Wheaton that opened up this whole secret world of military intelligence craziness where they really did have rooms full of goats and they brought in these martial arts guys to try and kill the goats just by staring at them and you know they say that from time to time a goat fell over but you know
[03:26:01.518 --> 03:26:12.464]  I think probably because it was suffering from some sort of pre-existing medical complaint or maybe was just kind of bored of being stared at for, you know, days on end by martial arts gurus from Ohio.
[03:26:12.464 --> 03:26:27.591]  And then what the book, The Manister of Goats, goes on to do is really look at how some of these ideas didn't really die out but mutated and came alive again in the form of different types of interrogation techniques at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and so on.
[03:26:27.591 --> 03:26:28.952]  The movie's lighter and doesn't
[03:26:29.312 --> 03:26:30.952]  And doesn't go into these darker areas.
[03:26:30.952 --> 03:26:32.413]  It's more comics.
[03:26:32.413 --> 03:26:34.513]  Well, John, I want to continue from there.
[03:26:34.513 --> 03:26:35.954]  We're talking to John Ronson.
[03:26:35.954 --> 03:26:37.074]  JohnRonson.com.
[03:26:37.074 --> 03:26:40.875]  He's the author of Men Who Stare at Goats and Them.
[03:26:40.875 --> 03:26:46.356]  But expanding on that, John, you talk about tip of the iceberg.
[03:26:46.356 --> 03:26:56.159]  I've been studying globalists, and if you went deeper down the rabbit hole, you would find that the reason those old men were getting so
[03:26:58.343 --> 03:27:03.185]  Upset or focused on the mock human sacrifice that you thought was silly?
[03:27:03.185 --> 03:27:11.428]  Was because they understand it was all symbolized and was symbols of something much, much deeper.
[03:27:11.428 --> 03:27:15.550]  And that all of this system is just simply the surface of something.
[03:27:15.550 --> 03:27:24.493]  Look at Skull and Bones, that video ABC News got with them screaming and yelling and worshipping Satan and, you know, practice mock murders of young girls.
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:27.862]  Look at the Rod Rosenbaum video, right?
[03:27:27.862 --> 03:27:29.883]  It was shot like a cross, you know?
[03:27:29.883 --> 03:27:31.284]  Right, right, right, yeah.
[03:27:31.284 --> 03:27:40.570]  But I mean, that's my point, John, is that they take it serious because the real ritual was not the image of the boy being burned.
[03:27:40.570 --> 03:27:45.093]  It was whatever happened behind those black curtains across the water.
[03:27:45.093 --> 03:27:49.656]  That's when the old men really got upset and really started growling and
[03:27:50.456 --> 03:27:50.917]  We're good to go.
[03:28:11.218 --> 03:28:23.106]  Well, again, this is where I kind of agree and disagree with you, because where I disagree with you, because I'm not, you know, conspiratorial minded, is that I believe that what we saw at Bohemian Grove was all that was going on that night.
[03:28:23.106 --> 03:28:26.949]  I don't believe there was anything going on behind the curtains.
[03:28:26.949 --> 03:28:37.956]  However, where I do agree with you is that the people who go to Skull & Bones and go to Bohemian Grove do seem to be into this idea of ritual and symbolism.
[03:28:37.956 --> 03:28:39.097]  I agree with you there.
[03:28:39.097 --> 03:28:40.778]  And so you have to ask yourselves, well,
[03:28:41.438 --> 03:28:42.478]  Why?
[03:28:42.478 --> 03:28:59.823]  And one person actually who was involved with Skull & Bones said to me that, actually the woman, she said that her interpretation of their kind of being intellectual was that it kind of gives you a sort of mandate, you know, sort of gives you a sense of superiority and a mandate to put yourself in a position of power.
[03:29:00.163 --> 03:29:06.204]  And that's why these Ivy League universities, you know, do all this kind of stupid, crazy stuff.
[03:29:06.204 --> 03:29:13.006]  And why these ideas live on in, you know, when they get into the business world in places like Bohemia and Guelph.
[03:29:13.006 --> 03:29:18.847]  But I don't believe at all that what we saw was any kind of actual human sacrifice.
[03:29:18.847 --> 03:29:20.347]  It was just a papier-mâché attitude.
[03:29:20.347 --> 03:29:24.028]  Well, I'm not saying I believe an actual human sacrifice was going on.
[03:29:24.028 --> 03:29:26.829]  I'm saying more was happening than meets the eye.
[03:29:26.829 --> 03:29:27.869]  And think about your statement.
[03:29:28.409 --> 03:29:30.891]  I don't believe anything was happening behind the curtain.
[03:29:30.891 --> 03:29:36.134]  You know, that's kind of a philosophical worldview on the planet itself.
[03:29:36.134 --> 03:29:38.975]  I believe there is something going on behind the curtain.
[03:29:38.975 --> 03:29:45.779]  And nine times out of ten, when we pull the curtain back, the real show's going on behind the curtain, John Ronson.
[03:29:45.779 --> 03:29:48.741]  I mean, look at how you wrote Men Who Stare at Goats.
[03:29:48.741 --> 03:29:51.883]  Just all this insane stuff going on.
[03:29:51.883 --> 03:29:53.264]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.264 --> 03:29:54.785]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.786 --> 03:30:01.352]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.352 --> 03:30:06.658]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.658 --> 03:30:11.203]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.203 --> 03:30:13.465]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.465 --> 03:30:15.107]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:15.107 --> 03:30:16.148]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.348 --> 03:30:24.777]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:01.243 --> 03:31:10.390]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:10.390 --> 03:31:13.773]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.773 --> 03:31:19.637]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[03:31:19.637 --> 03:31:24.121]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:31:24.401 --> 03:31:36.224]  Oxysilver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[03:31:36.224 --> 03:31:41.766]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[03:31:41.766 --> 03:31:43.606]  Help others and earn extra income!
[03:31:43.686 --> 03:31:43.886]  Thank you.
[03:32:02.540 --> 03:32:04.181]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:32:04.181 --> 03:32:08.182]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[03:32:08.182 --> 03:32:15.705]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love and care.
[03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:19.230]  We're good to go!
[03:32:45.367 --> 03:32:46.188]  My name is Bob Wilton.
[03:32:46.188 --> 03:32:47.048]  I'm a journalist.
[03:32:47.048 --> 03:32:51.151]  I've been investigating a story about a classified government program.
[03:32:51.151 --> 03:32:52.652]  So, what you're saying is that you
[03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:18.610]  We're a, uh, psychic spy.
[03:33:18.610 --> 03:33:21.471]  A Jedi warrior.
[03:33:21.471 --> 03:33:22.371]  I'd heard that the U.S.
[03:33:22.371 --> 03:33:26.833]  government was training psychic soldiers, and that Lynne Cassidy was the best of the best.
[03:33:26.833 --> 03:33:28.493]  I've been reactivated.
[03:33:28.493 --> 03:33:29.713]  I'm on a mission.
[03:33:29.713 --> 03:33:30.613]  I could come.
[03:33:30.613 --> 03:33:34.915]  Lynne's story was unbelievable, crazy, and completely true.
[03:33:34.915 --> 03:33:41.436]  You have to dream a new America that no longer has an exploitative view of everyone.
[03:33:41.436 --> 03:33:43.717]  You will be a psychic weapon!
[03:33:43.717 --> 03:33:44.557]  Feel it, yeah!
[03:33:45.695 --> 03:33:52.318]  You must create warrior monks who can pass through walls and see into the future.
[03:33:52.318 --> 03:33:53.899]  Congratulations, Scotty.
[03:33:53.899 --> 03:33:55.380]  Sorry it doesn't work out between you two.
[03:33:55.380 --> 03:33:58.181]  What are you doing?
[03:33:58.181 --> 03:33:59.121]  Cloudbursting.
[03:33:59.121 --> 03:34:01.422]  Keeps me in shape.
[03:34:01.422 --> 03:34:04.864]  And it's gone.
[03:34:04.864 --> 03:34:08.526]  Jeez, you had, like, the whole desert to drive inland.
[03:34:08.526 --> 03:34:10.247]  Please, please!
[03:34:10.247 --> 03:34:12.748]  Thank you for, uh, for picking us up.
[03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:17.152]  How are we gonna stop them?
[03:34:17.152 --> 03:34:18.734]  They've got guns.
[03:34:18.734 --> 03:34:19.515]  We're Jedi.
[03:34:19.515 --> 03:34:20.396]  We don't fight with guns.
[03:34:20.396 --> 03:34:23.299]  We fight with our minds.
[03:34:23.299 --> 03:34:25.022]  Oh, wait.
[03:34:44.947 --> 03:34:50.169]  I went looking for a story, and my friend Lynn brought me an adventure.
[03:34:50.169 --> 03:34:51.589]  It's okay, we're Americans!
[03:34:51.589 --> 03:34:53.350]  We're here to help you!
[03:34:53.350 --> 03:34:54.090]  What happened?
[03:34:54.090 --> 03:34:55.691]  I think I just ran him over.
[03:34:55.691 --> 03:34:59.792]  Oh, crap!
[03:34:59.792 --> 03:35:00.352]  The man who... Lt.
[03:35:00.352 --> 03:35:00.512]  Col.
[03:35:00.512 --> 03:35:04.333]  Django used funds from the project's black budget to procure prostitutes.
[03:35:04.333 --> 03:35:05.254]  That's a lie!
[03:35:05.254 --> 03:35:07.474]  And to get drugs for himself and his men.
[03:35:07.474 --> 03:35:11.816]  That... Well, the hooker thing is definitely a lie.
[03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:22.262]  All right, the Minister of Goats came out November 6th, doing quite well in movie theaters around the country.
[03:35:22.262 --> 03:35:23.804]  And John Ronson's the big star.
[03:35:23.804 --> 03:35:26.448]  He's the big reporter interviewing these guys.
[03:35:26.448 --> 03:35:29.872]  Did you actually go to the Middle East and run over people?
[03:35:29.872 --> 03:35:30.994]  I mean, did all of that happen?
[03:35:31.684 --> 03:35:33.405]  No, that part didn't happen.
[03:35:33.405 --> 03:35:35.425]  Pretty much everything else happened.
[03:35:35.425 --> 03:35:41.528]  There's the... Peter Stroud, who wrote the screenplay, kind of added a sort of buddy movie element to it.
[03:35:41.528 --> 03:35:45.149]  But I didn't really kind of, you know, I didn't learn and grow much at all.
[03:35:45.149 --> 03:35:50.611]  I was always a kind of bit of a cynic when it came to the existence of these paranormal powers.
[03:35:50.611 --> 03:35:55.833]  So Peter made the Ewan McGregor character have kind of more adventures than I had in the Middle East.
[03:35:55.833 --> 03:35:58.554]  But everything else in the movie is completely good.
[03:35:58.554 --> 03:35:59.654]  Well, I get the idea.
[03:36:00.521 --> 03:36:04.891]  I meant to go see the movie this weekend when you agreed to do the interview, but I just didn't get around to it.
[03:36:04.891 --> 03:36:09.140]  I do intend to go see it, but I get the idea from the trailers and some of the sneak peeks I've watched online.
[03:36:10.126 --> 03:36:18.531]  And also, I've read the book, that the film makes fun of a lot of it, but also implies there could be something there.
[03:36:18.531 --> 03:36:20.212]  Like, he is cloudbursting.
[03:36:20.212 --> 03:36:23.954]  He is breaking up the clouds with his mind.
[03:36:23.954 --> 03:36:28.317]  There are some delusionals here in Austin that go out on hilltops and think they're doing the same thing.
[03:36:28.317 --> 03:36:34.221]  I mean, does the film imply that George Clooney really does kill this goat?
[03:36:35.769 --> 03:36:36.469]  It doesn't really.
[03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:37.670]  It kind of toys with us.
[03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:39.751]  And I think that's something that's really nice about the film.
[03:36:39.751 --> 03:36:46.314]  You know, when you read my book, when you read The Man Who Stared at Goats, you know, you know, that my idea was that none of this stuff worked at all.
[03:36:46.314 --> 03:36:48.615]  But Peter kind of toys with the possibility that it works.
[03:36:48.615 --> 03:36:54.698]  But I think in the end, you kind of think that the George Clooney character is a kind of bit of a Buzz Lightyear.
[03:36:54.758 --> 03:36:58.661]  Yeah, as a radio DJ over here called Simon Mayo described him the other day.
[03:36:58.661 --> 03:37:01.503]  You know, he thinks he has all these powers, but he doesn't.
[03:37:01.503 --> 03:37:08.829]  So when you see in flashback the goat being stared at and then falling over, you don't believe that that necessarily actually happened.
[03:37:08.829 --> 03:37:11.231]  You just believe that he believes that it happened.
[03:37:11.231 --> 03:37:21.999]  So I think by and large, even though Grant Hesloff, the director of the film, is more inclined to believe in the paranormal than I am, you kind of come away thinking that it's probably not true.
[03:37:24.096 --> 03:37:34.068]  But everybody's had dreams that come true or had premonitions of family dying or being hurt or maybe everybody I know has.
[03:37:34.068 --> 03:37:38.653]  Mr. Ronson, are you saying you don't believe that there's any of this going on in the world?
[03:37:38.653 --> 03:37:40.275]  Anything that we don't understand that's happening?
[03:37:42.080 --> 03:37:44.222]  If I say yeah, I don't believe that at all.
[03:37:44.222 --> 03:37:49.585]  I'm going to come over like the world's worst magic-sucking curmudgeon.
[03:37:49.585 --> 03:37:52.187]  But that's sort of what I feel.
[03:37:52.187 --> 03:37:53.908]  You know, I wish it weren't true.
[03:37:53.908 --> 03:37:59.012]  I would love there to be these other levels that we could all, you know, go to, you know, especially when we die.
[03:37:59.012 --> 03:38:01.954]  But I'm just not sure of it, Alex.
[03:38:01.954 --> 03:38:03.995]  Magic-sucking curmudgeon.
[03:38:03.995 --> 03:38:05.276]  That's me.
[03:38:05.276 --> 03:38:06.497]  That's my middle name.
[03:38:08.731 --> 03:38:11.452]  Hey, you ran into David Icke!
[03:38:11.452 --> 03:38:31.796]  Yeah, I saw him in the toilet queue at Heathrow Airport last week and, you know, like you, you know, neither you nor David Icke particularly liked my book then because it was anti-conspiratorial, but nonetheless it was just delightful to see David Icke and we practically gave each other a big hug and I sort of think, well, in the end, you know, we may
[03:38:32.136 --> 03:38:32.937]  I guess we are getting older.
[03:38:46.491 --> 03:39:00.035]  Yeah, and it's like, you know, so the fact that, you know, David was very happy to see me, and I was happy to see him, and we kind of buried any political differences and, you know, differences in the outlook of the way the world works, and it was just really nice.
[03:39:00.035 --> 03:39:12.139]  John, am I wrong in saying, though, you have, on, say, a scale of 1 to 10, we're 10, you're a 0, when it comes to believing conspiracy theories, that you've gone from like a 1 over to a 6 or 7?
[03:39:12.139 --> 03:39:15.300]  I mean, from what I've seen of you on television,
[03:39:16.258 --> 03:39:25.969]  Or maybe that's the role you play when you're on mainstream TV because they're so dried out and stale that you look like a conspiracy theorist.
[03:39:25.969 --> 03:39:33.037]  But when I see you on television, you seem to be admitting there's a world government forming and that there is some cover-ups and corruption.
[03:39:33.037 --> 03:39:35.300]  I mean, you don't discount at all.
[03:39:36.129 --> 03:39:39.932]  Well, there's nothing I've said, for instance, in the interview to you today that I, you know, regret.
[03:39:39.932 --> 03:39:52.400]  I mean, you know, I know that that was Bilderberg's agenda because one of the founders of the Bilderberg Group said it to me, that their original agenda was some form of world government or certainly a kind of single community throughout the world.
[03:39:52.400 --> 03:40:01.886]  And I agree with you, I completely disagree with you that the Bohemian Grove ritual proved that there was any kind of weird Satanism or anything kind of really dark and crazy going on.
[03:40:01.886 --> 03:40:05.929]  But, you know, I agree that there was a weirdness there, that they were really, really into it.
[03:40:06.369 --> 03:40:09.670]  In a way that, you know, I thought it was just nuts.
[03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:16.152]  And, you know, what I really like about my book, The Minister at Goats, is that it's sort of, I think both sides get something out of it.
[03:40:16.152 --> 03:40:23.114]  You know, the sceptics like me get something out of it because it just shows how buffoonish and absurd human behaviour can be.
[03:40:23.114 --> 03:40:25.595]  Which is sort of an anti-conspiratorial thought, right?
[03:40:26.395 --> 03:40:33.176]  Conspiracy theorists need to believe that people are so brilliant and so Machiavellian that they can plot these amazing conspiracies.
[03:40:33.176 --> 03:40:39.457]  But I think what the Menace to Eric Goetz says is that, no, people are just nuts trying to walk into walls and do all this kind of stuff.
[03:40:39.457 --> 03:40:49.419]  However, conspiracy theorists like you, I'm also glad to say, like the Menace to Eric Goetz, because it does show that there's stuff going on, as you said, behind the curtain.
[03:40:49.419 --> 03:40:52.940]  But, is this the term conspiracy theorist is
[03:40:53.806 --> 03:41:00.188]  been produced and is employed to automatically say this person can't prove what they're talking about.
[03:41:00.188 --> 03:41:07.490]  I was called a conspiracy theorist ten years ago by several newspapers for saying the Gulf of Tonkin was staged to get us into Vietnam.
[03:41:07.490 --> 03:41:09.550]  It's now declassified.
[03:41:09.550 --> 03:41:14.071]  It's now been declassified that the United States government created Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
[03:41:14.071 --> 03:41:15.852]  You can call me a conspiracy theorist.
[03:41:15.852 --> 03:41:20.053]  I said the carbon tax would be used to set up a world government and to fund it.
[03:41:20.686 --> 03:41:23.507]  And then it would come after a controlled economic collapse.
[03:41:23.507 --> 03:41:25.828]  That's now mainstream news.
[03:41:25.828 --> 03:41:32.690]  So, I don't get into chupacabras and aliens and dimensional gates and things I can't prove.
[03:41:32.690 --> 03:41:37.512]  But then I get mixed in with the people that do cover things they can't prove.
[03:41:37.512 --> 03:41:42.274]  But, you know, there's other conspiracy theorists that get hailed as our saviors.
[03:41:42.274 --> 03:41:44.015]  Take the cover of Newsweek.
[03:41:44.015 --> 03:41:45.815]  The Thinking Man's Thinking Man.
[03:41:45.815 --> 03:41:47.596]  Al Gore's new plan for the planet.
[03:41:48.752 --> 03:41:52.015]  A eco-prophet gets real.
[03:41:52.015 --> 03:41:57.960]  And it goes into saying he's a prophet and his new film is about how it's a religion.
[03:41:57.960 --> 03:42:02.563]  Look, I happen to know there's not a consensus on man-made global warming.
[03:42:02.563 --> 03:42:05.486]  I happen to know the majority of scientists say it's a fraud.
[03:42:05.486 --> 03:42:09.049]  I happen to know carbon dioxide isn't a toxic waste.
[03:42:10.069 --> 03:42:16.854]  And then ice core samples show that the Earth had much higher levels of carbon dioxide 200,000 years ago.
[03:42:16.854 --> 03:42:22.358]  I happen to know that until four years ago, the ice caps of Mars were getting smaller.
[03:42:22.358 --> 03:42:29.923]  They're now getting bigger because the sun just cooled off into one of the most dormant cycles ever recorded in 300 years.
[03:42:29.923 --> 03:42:36.828]  So I'm not the conspiracy theorist because I track what NASA says and what climatologists says and common sense.
[03:42:36.828 --> 03:42:38.209]  When Al Gore points a camera,
[03:42:38.869 --> 03:42:42.370]  At a polar bear and says polar bears can't swim, they're dying.
[03:42:42.370 --> 03:42:46.152]  When they're the greatest land swimmer on Earth and hunt from the ice flows.
[03:42:46.152 --> 03:42:47.112]  I know it's a lie.
[03:42:47.112 --> 03:42:55.715]  When they say my SUV is melting ice caps on Mars and on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, I know it's a load of crap.
[03:42:55.715 --> 03:43:05.099]  Not just because I empirically know with the evidence, Al Gore and his people have written prospectuses up how this is all just a big business to hijack control the entire planet, John Ronson.
[03:43:07.482 --> 03:43:14.508]  Well, I haven't, I haven't... I really can't get me to refute all of that in the space of about 30 seconds, Alex.
[03:43:14.508 --> 03:43:15.088]  No, go ahead.
[03:43:15.088 --> 03:43:15.688]  You have the floor.
[03:43:15.688 --> 03:43:16.369]  Way too much.
[03:43:16.369 --> 03:43:18.651]  No, I'm not going to... Can I ask you a completely different question?
[03:43:18.651 --> 03:43:19.591]  Can polar bears swim?
[03:43:19.591 --> 03:43:23.314]  I have a real problem with the 9-11 truth thing.
[03:43:23.314 --> 03:43:24.115]  I'm one of... Are you?
[03:43:24.115 --> 03:43:25.035]  Wait, wait.
[03:43:25.035 --> 03:43:26.156]  Is that against your religion?
[03:43:26.156 --> 03:43:33.522]  In your religion, or if you're a fake greenie, do you believe that polar bears can swim?
[03:43:33.522 --> 03:43:34.823]  Is the prophet wrong?
[03:43:36.921 --> 03:43:38.162]  Are we going to have riots?
[03:43:38.162 --> 03:43:38.443]  Hold on.
[03:43:38.443 --> 03:43:44.188]  Are we going to have riots in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and London if I was to paint a picture of a bomb on his head?
[03:43:44.188 --> 03:43:48.952]  There is only one God and his prophet is Al Gore?
[03:43:54.075 --> 03:44:02.817]  Well you know Alex, as always your kind of oratory is stunning and it's something that I find kind of quite amazing about you.
[03:44:02.817 --> 03:44:04.738]  But I can't answer... Oh come on!
[03:44:04.738 --> 03:44:16.381]  And one of the reasons why I can't answer any of that stuff is because frankly Alex, I've been so busy with these other projects that I'm working on, I haven't really looked into the whole global warming denial movement and I just don't feel in any way equipped to talk about it.
[03:44:16.961 --> 03:44:18.182]  The denial movement.
[03:44:18.182 --> 03:44:19.663]  Okay, you brought up 9-11 truth.
[03:44:19.663 --> 03:44:21.545]  What's your problem with that?
[03:44:21.545 --> 03:44:27.309]  Just when you were saying all of that stuff, a little thought popped into my head, and I've always wanted to know your response to this, actually, so I'll ask you.
[03:44:27.309 --> 03:44:30.672]  It's built into the 9-11 truth belief.
[03:44:32.361 --> 03:44:44.347]  Is that, you know, the media, the mainstream media, people like me, just wouldn't be interested, you know, we just don't want to reveal the truth of the matter because we're all sort of part of the, you know, part of the conspiracy.
[03:44:44.347 --> 03:44:53.651]  And I think if there was any evidence, if there was any clue that 9-11 was an inside job, every single journalist in the world would just be jumping on that story.
[03:44:53.651 --> 03:44:54.691]  Really?
[03:44:54.691 --> 03:44:59.153]  Yeah, yeah, I'm absolutely certain of that because it would be the world's greatest story, you know?
[03:44:59.153 --> 03:45:00.574]  Okay, so you're asking me a question?
[03:45:01.283 --> 03:45:08.968]  Yeah, I'm asking the question, you know, it's impossible to rationally believe that every journalist in the world would have any kind of knowledge like that.
[03:45:08.968 --> 03:45:10.228]  Okay, that's a false statement.
[03:45:10.228 --> 03:45:11.609]  That's a false statement.
[03:45:11.609 --> 03:45:24.997]  The establishment selects and promotes journalists in the controlled left and controlled right paradigm that already fit into the worldview and buy in to the official story and believe there's never anything behind curtains.
[03:45:25.854 --> 03:45:26.454]  Okay.
[03:45:26.454 --> 03:45:28.616]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[03:45:28.616 --> 03:45:30.957]  There have been a lot of reporters that have gone public.
[03:45:30.957 --> 03:45:34.038]  They've been ridiculed or fired, underwriting laboratories.
[03:45:34.038 --> 03:45:37.060]  Kevin Ryan got fired, one of their chief engineers.
[03:45:37.060 --> 03:45:40.422]  There are policemen on tape saying, get back, they're going to bring down seven.
[03:45:41.122 --> 03:45:58.249]  The BBC reported Building 7 had fallen before it fell, then they lied and said they didn't say it, then they said it was an accident, then they admitted Reuters had given them that, just like the news media printed that Lee Harvey Oswald had been captured before his name was even out in Dallas.
[03:45:58.249 --> 03:46:02.271]  They got the names wrong because of time zones in Asia.
[03:46:02.271 --> 03:46:04.172]  That's confirmed.
[03:46:04.172 --> 03:46:09.074]  When you look at NORAD standing down, when you look at the hijackers trained at US military bases,
[03:46:09.674 --> 03:46:19.966]  It actually was in AP Reuters, the San Jose Mercury News, that the head colonel over the head base said, look, I trained hijackers at my base.
[03:46:19.966 --> 03:46:23.049]  I don't know what happened, but these guys were working for the U.S.
[03:46:23.049 --> 03:46:23.430]  government.
[03:46:24.247 --> 03:46:33.314]  Okay, so I know a passport came out of one of the buildings unscathed and was found by the FBI in those hundreds of thousands of tons of wreckage.
[03:46:33.314 --> 03:46:35.175]  I mean, come on, John.
[03:46:35.175 --> 03:46:35.916]  Come on, John.
[03:46:35.916 --> 03:46:37.817]  I mean, Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[03:46:37.817 --> 03:46:39.358]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:46:39.358 --> 03:46:44.042]  Operation Northwoods is declassified where the government planned 9-11 style attacks, Bubba.
[03:46:44.562 --> 03:46:49.945]  All I'm saying is, look, six of the ten commissioners have said the entire thing was a fraud and a cover-up.
[03:46:49.945 --> 03:46:52.026]  Why isn't that in the news more, John?
[03:46:52.026 --> 03:46:54.987]  Granted, it's been in the Washington Post, but nothing ever happens.
[03:46:56.280 --> 03:47:18.849]  Well, I sort of wish I hadn't brought up 9-11 again, because we've been, you know, the likes of me and the likes of you have been through this stuff a zillion times over the years, but I still don't think you answered my original question, which is that, you know, I work within a world of the mainstream media, especially on the left, and I know that journalists on the left and journalists on the right would win a Pulitzer the size of a building if they could somehow provide evidence.
[03:47:18.849 --> 03:47:19.809]  Okay, take Monday on it.
[03:47:20.689 --> 03:47:23.411]  Take that Mombiot guy at The Guardian, one of your colleagues.
[03:47:23.411 --> 03:47:27.733]  He writes articles a year ago saying, I'm a kook, there's no world government.
[03:47:27.733 --> 03:47:34.216]  And then, he publishes and signs a letter from 200 top journalists calling for a one world government.
[03:47:34.216 --> 03:47:36.337]  I mean, they're intellectually bankrupt, John.
[03:47:36.337 --> 03:47:40.379]  I mean, you can't have it both ways.
[03:47:40.379 --> 03:47:42.100]  World government's good.
[03:47:42.100 --> 03:47:45.782]  World government doesn't exist.
[03:47:45.782 --> 03:47:47.143]  I'm not saying you're doing that.
[03:47:47.143 --> 03:47:49.084]  I mean, you'll at least admit they're saying it.
[03:47:49.850 --> 03:47:57.692]  But if you were a good little globalist, you'd come on here and say, no, Alex doesn't exist, and then write a book about how great world government is.
[03:47:57.692 --> 03:48:09.976]  Well, as I said earlier in the interview, my view about world government is that I think it was this kind of, you know, what they considered to be a kind of idealistic vision in the early 50s that sort of, you know, history shows has turned sour because
[03:48:10.516 --> 03:48:17.498]  What nobody expected was that CEOs would, you know, behave in a psychopathic and selfish and irrational way.
[03:48:17.498 --> 03:48:18.439]  Oh, never, never that.
[03:48:18.439 --> 03:48:26.502]  Hey, listen, in the time we got left, johnronson.com, and I'm going to try to twist your arm for five more minutes after this break, just the whole hour, because this is too great having you on.
[03:48:26.502 --> 03:48:28.642]  I want you to be able to ask me some questions, too.
[03:48:28.642 --> 03:48:34.564]  But did you get to meet George Clooney or Ewing McGregor or any of these great actors?
[03:48:36.605 --> 03:48:37.405]  Yeah, I did, I did.
[03:48:37.405 --> 03:48:52.012]  I went onto the set and watched them film it for a few days in Puerto Rico and then I went around the various premieres, you know, in Venice and Canada and London and Toronto and so yeah, I spent some time with them.
[03:48:52.012 --> 03:48:53.973]  Pretty nice guys, I hear.
[03:48:53.973 --> 03:48:56.994]  They all were.
[03:48:56.994 --> 03:49:00.176]  Now, do they think it's ridiculous or do any of them buy into this stuff?
[03:49:00.993 --> 03:49:10.703]  Well, um, I think the only person, well, the only two people I know who are like in the kind of core of the movie who did believe in the paranormal stuff, uh, was Jeff Bridges.
[03:49:10.703 --> 03:49:12.946]  I mean, he's, he's certainly a believer.
[03:49:12.946 --> 03:49:16.810]  And he got on very well with Jim Channon, who's the real guy who he plays in the movie.
[03:49:17.450 --> 03:49:25.972]  And Grant Hesloff, the director, he says even though he has never seen any paranormal stuff happening, you know, he wants to believe that it can.
[03:49:25.972 --> 03:49:35.493]  And actually, I think a lot of the people who like the movie like it because it's got a sort of warm heart to it and it's got a humanity to it, whereas my book is a bit more sort of cynical.
[03:49:35.493 --> 03:49:41.194]  Alright, shifting gears quickly in case you can't, because I know you've got family, hold over another five to finish up.
[03:49:41.194 --> 03:49:42.094]  Tell me about them.
[03:49:42.094 --> 03:49:42.994]  Oh, you mean about the movie?
[03:49:42.994 --> 03:49:43.074]  Yes.
[03:49:46.542 --> 03:49:52.303]  Yeah, well, it got optioned, you know, back in about five years ago, same time as The Manistow Goats got optioned.
[03:49:52.303 --> 03:49:55.164]  And, you know, as you know, nothing's really happened since.
[03:49:55.164 --> 03:50:00.105]  And you know that Jack Black was attached to be in it.
[03:50:00.105 --> 03:50:02.305]  But, you know, God knows, you know.
[03:50:02.305 --> 03:50:05.746]  Edgar, who's supposed to be directing us, is directing another movie at the moment.
[03:50:05.746 --> 03:50:13.187]  And I just hope that, you know, when he finishes his other movie, he turns his attention to the wonderful, you know, project that is then.
[03:50:13.187 --> 03:50:16.128]  But, you know, I can't force him as much as I'd like to.
[03:50:17.489 --> 03:50:29.697]  Well, I think the fact that one of your books has already been made into a major movie and doing quite well at the box office, I would hope that that would, because even though it's going to be a huge hit piece, I would like to know what they're writing.
[03:50:29.697 --> 03:50:36.282]  I mean, if my character is going to be in there and what great evil type of person I'm going to be in the movie Them if that does happen.
[03:50:37.131 --> 03:50:44.139]  Well, I think if it does happen and if there is a character in there that's kind of inspired by you, you will love it.
[03:50:44.139 --> 03:50:47.964]  I think it will be a completely lovely portrayal.
[03:50:47.964 --> 03:50:52.029]  Because, you know, movies, especially these kinds of movies, you know, they don't want to...
[03:50:52.649 --> 03:50:54.811]  Sort of just attack people, you know?
[03:50:54.811 --> 03:50:57.753]  I think you'd be delighted by the portrayal of this.
[03:50:57.753 --> 03:50:59.134]  Tell you what, Jon, stay there.
[03:50:59.134 --> 03:51:03.637]  I want to come back and talk about what you're doing in the future, then we'll let you go and get back to your family.
[03:51:03.637 --> 03:51:05.398]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:51:05.398 --> 03:51:06.919]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:51:06.919 --> 03:51:08.240]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:10.182]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:51:10.182 --> 03:51:18.888]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:51:18.968 --> 03:51:24.391]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:51:24.391 --> 03:51:26.192]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:51:26.192 --> 03:51:33.676]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[03:52:04.588 --> 03:52:08.615]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:08.615 --> 03:52:11.861]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:11.861 --> 03:52:13.284]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:13.976 --> 03:52:16.657]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:16.657 --> 03:52:23.040]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:23.040 --> 03:52:28.583]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:28.583 --> 03:52:38.228]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:38.328 --> 03:52:40.690]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:40.690 --> 03:52:42.272]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:42.272 --> 03:52:44.734]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:44.734 --> 03:52:46.856]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:46.856 --> 03:52:52.021]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:52.021 --> 03:52:57.026]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:53:03.217 --> 03:53:07.701]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[03:53:07.701 --> 03:53:11.985]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[03:53:11.985 --> 03:53:22.835]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[03:53:22.835 --> 03:53:25.057]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful
[03:53:25.077 --> 03:53:25.537]  We're good to go.

[03:54:05.827 --> 03:54:10.210]  You know, it's probably been five years since I've been on the radio with John Ronson.
[03:54:10.210 --> 03:54:13.612]  I went on coast-to-coast AM work with him once.
[03:54:13.612 --> 03:54:15.033]  We've got to have him back more often.
[03:54:16.036 --> 03:54:28.946]  So, John, you're award-winning documentaries on TV, award-winning documentaries on radio, writing for The Guardian, writing for other big publications here in the U.S., two best-selling books.
[03:54:28.946 --> 03:54:31.368]  Everything you do hits the zeitgeist.
[03:54:31.368 --> 03:54:34.210]  What's coming up next for John Ronson?
[03:54:34.210 --> 03:54:38.013]  Well, I'm writing another book, but I can't really talk about what it's about.
[03:54:38.013 --> 03:54:39.594]  I'm worried that if too much
[03:54:40.572 --> 03:54:46.194]  If information gets disseminated then it's going to be hard for me to get, you know, access to things and so on.
[03:54:46.194 --> 03:54:48.696]  But, you know, I'm writing a good new book.
[03:54:48.696 --> 03:54:56.599]  Can I just say, at risk of setting you off on a very, very long monologue, can I just read out a tweet that I just got from somebody?
[03:54:56.599 --> 03:54:57.599]  Sure.
[03:54:57.599 --> 03:55:05.183]  Okay, actually, Mombio was referring to a World Council to solve environmental issues, not a One World Government.
[03:55:05.183 --> 03:55:05.743]  Who said that?
[03:55:06.971 --> 03:55:10.675]  A tweeter who follows me called Socialist Sully.
[03:55:10.675 --> 03:55:11.816]  Socialist Sully.
[03:55:11.816 --> 03:55:16.462]  I guess that his tweeting name probably will put you off.
[03:55:16.462 --> 03:55:18.284]  Look, look, look, here's the deal.
[03:55:18.857 --> 03:55:20.779]  Bilderberg-controlled public.
[03:55:20.779 --> 03:55:22.540]  They're laughing in the control room.
[03:55:22.540 --> 03:55:23.821]  Look, I'm tired of the crap.
[03:55:23.821 --> 03:55:30.848]  There's a world government being set up, and the same reporters that attack me then write articles saying how great it is.
[03:55:30.848 --> 03:55:34.871]  And no, Mombiot said we need a world government to solve our problems.
[03:55:34.871 --> 03:55:42.418]  And then this liberal, who's a fake, twists it and goes, he's not for world government, he's for a loving world government!
[03:55:42.418 --> 03:55:43.819]  It's not loving.
[03:55:43.819 --> 03:55:44.840]  Did you see the article?
[03:55:45.811 --> 03:55:51.714]  That was written in the Financial Times of London, where it called for a tyrannical world government?
[03:55:51.714 --> 03:55:55.255]  No, but God, that sounds like a very aggressive journalist.
[03:55:55.255 --> 03:55:56.356]  Guys, pull it up.
[03:55:56.356 --> 03:55:56.876]  Pull it up.
[03:55:56.876 --> 03:56:02.178]  It's AndNowForWorldGovernmentFT.com.
[03:56:02.178 --> 03:56:05.800]  Well, the Financial Times says it's time we had a tyrannical world government.
[03:56:09.966 --> 03:56:14.248]  Sorry, my son is really laughing because that sounds like the most horrible article ever.
[03:56:14.248 --> 03:56:17.390]  No, no, no, but he said, he said, yes, it's been secret.
[03:56:17.390 --> 03:56:19.271]  Yes, we kept it secret from you.
[03:56:19.271 --> 03:56:25.775]  It's called And Now For World Government by Gideon Raichman.
[03:56:25.775 --> 03:56:29.297]  But he said, it's got to be authoritarian for your own good.
[03:56:29.297 --> 03:56:32.599]  What's wrong with that?
[03:56:32.599 --> 03:56:34.180]  By the way, I think he's one of the editors there.
[03:56:35.224 --> 03:56:38.427]  I am interested, by the way, in the kind of notion of authoritarianism.
[03:56:38.427 --> 03:56:40.208]  That is something I'm looking at in the new book.
[03:56:40.208 --> 03:56:46.954]  You know, the idea that some people become kind of self-appointed, you know, mandators about how other people should and shouldn't behave.
[03:56:46.954 --> 03:56:48.035]  Oh, like Al Gore?
[03:56:48.035 --> 03:56:49.456]  Do you think Al Gore is saving us?
[03:56:49.456 --> 03:56:51.297]  Well, I haven't been looking into Al Gore.
[03:56:51.297 --> 03:56:53.839]  I'm looking into a kind of different field of expertise.
[03:56:53.839 --> 03:56:56.061]  But, you know, this is an area that interests me.
[03:56:56.061 --> 03:57:02.767]  It's interesting, Alex, the stuff that you're interested in and the stuff that I'm interested in is often very, very similar, but we just cover it from different worldviews.
[03:57:05.427 --> 03:57:06.208]  Hey, here it is.
[03:57:06.208 --> 03:57:10.371]  It's Manifesto for a New World Order, George Mombiot.
[03:57:10.371 --> 03:57:14.194]  But then... But then he writes articles saying none of it exists.
[03:57:14.194 --> 03:57:16.316]  He thinks his readers are stupid.
[03:57:16.316 --> 03:57:17.437]  He's like, it doesn't exist.
[03:57:17.437 --> 03:57:18.197]  Stand down.
[03:57:18.197 --> 03:57:19.538]  He's like, forward forces!
[03:57:19.538 --> 03:57:20.439]  Take them down!
[03:57:20.439 --> 03:57:21.640]  Poses, you're liberal!
[03:57:21.640 --> 03:57:22.281]  It's ours!
[03:57:22.281 --> 03:57:23.502]  The world is ours!
[03:57:23.502 --> 03:57:24.743]  These scum don't know it!
[03:57:24.743 --> 03:57:27.885]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:57:27.885 --> 03:57:29.166]  It's unbelievable, right?
[03:57:29.166 --> 03:57:30.888]  Hey, here's Violet right here.
[03:57:30.888 --> 03:57:32.189]  Wanna come say hi to Violet?
[03:57:32.189 --> 03:57:33.149]  Hi, Violet.
[03:57:33.149 --> 03:57:34.891]  He was just talking about how much he likes you.
[03:57:35.976 --> 03:57:37.177]  Honey, remember John Ronson?
[03:57:37.177 --> 03:57:39.859]  Yeah, yeah, well, here, come and say hi on the mic.
[03:57:39.859 --> 03:57:41.321]  We won't put you on radio.
[03:57:41.321 --> 03:57:42.181]  He's gone in one minute.
[03:57:42.181 --> 03:57:42.982]  Come on in here.
[03:57:42.982 --> 03:57:45.784]  She doesn't want to be on TV, just... Ah, okay.
[03:57:45.784 --> 03:57:47.466]  Hey, Violet.
[03:57:47.466 --> 03:57:48.286]  She doesn't have headphones.
[03:57:48.286 --> 03:57:49.667]  Hi, John, how are you?
[03:57:49.667 --> 03:57:50.588]  Hey, I'm alright.
[03:57:50.588 --> 03:57:52.410]  It's good to... I can't hear you.
[03:57:52.410 --> 03:57:54.592]  Well, I'm saying nice things.
[03:57:54.592 --> 03:57:55.973]  Alex, tell her that I'm saying nice things.
[03:57:55.973 --> 03:57:56.873]  Don't say I'm saying horrible things.
[03:57:56.873 --> 03:57:57.354]  He's saying nice things.
[03:57:57.354 --> 03:57:58.395]  Boy, she's good-looking, John.
[03:57:59.048 --> 03:57:59.788]  I know, I know.
[03:57:59.788 --> 03:58:02.370]  She's a very... I've always... I mean, you know, yeah.
[03:58:02.370 --> 03:58:03.711]  I'm not going to go down that road.
[03:58:03.711 --> 03:58:06.192]  No, I... Val is a very lovely person.
[03:58:06.192 --> 03:58:10.394]  I've got very warm memories of our night together in Northern California.
[03:58:10.394 --> 03:58:12.455]  It was a great time.
[03:58:12.455 --> 03:58:17.078]  Even though we came away utterly... with utterly different views of what we saw at Bohemian Grove.
[03:58:17.078 --> 03:58:20.379]  I do think of that as one of the... Make sure you say that 150 times!
[03:58:22.316 --> 03:58:28.638]  It's a wonderful person, and I'm glad that, you know, you guys, after all these years, you're still tight.
[03:58:28.638 --> 03:58:29.378]  You're still there.
[03:58:29.378 --> 03:58:33.520]  Hey, John, promise me that when your new book comes out, you'll come on here first.
[03:58:33.520 --> 03:58:35.640]  I will be there, and thanks, Alex, for having me.
[03:58:35.640 --> 03:58:36.801]  I've really enjoyed the last hour.
[03:58:36.801 --> 03:58:37.861]  It's good talking to you again.
[03:58:37.861 --> 03:58:38.741]  All right, buddy.
[03:58:38.741 --> 03:58:39.362]  Good having you here.
[03:58:39.362 --> 03:58:43.543]  I'll say bye to you during the break.
[03:58:43.543 --> 03:58:46.144]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.144 --> 03:58:49.325]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.499 --> 03:58:54.881]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.881 --> 03:58:58.503]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.503 --> 03:59:03.065]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:03.065 --> 03:59:08.668]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.948 --> 03:59:13.732]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.732 --> 03:59:17.355]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.355 --> 03:59:22.179]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.179 --> 03:59:28.745]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.745 --> 03:59:30.687]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.167 --> 03:59:34.370]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[03:59:34.370 --> 03:59:38.873]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[03:59:38.873 --> 03:59:40.655]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[03:59:41.095 --> 03:59:41.396]  877-327-0365.
[03:59:41.396 --> 03:59:41.636]  Don't wait.

[03:59:42.256 --> 03:59:42.977]  Coast to Coast.

[03:59:43.838 --> 03:59:46.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
