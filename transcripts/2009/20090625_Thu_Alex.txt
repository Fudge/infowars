[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.150]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.492]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:12.536]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:14.256]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:16.077]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:17.538]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.239]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:28.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.943]  Alright, we're now into the second hour of this worldwide transmission.
[00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:57.608]  Webster Griffin Tarpley will be with us for two hours, maybe even longer, if I can twist his arm into it, because I got a host of issues to talk about with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:00:58.812 --> 00:01:04.839]  As viewers know, many of you, Webster Griffin Tarpoli is really the main voice of the Obama deception.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.623]  It has my good friend and economist George Humphrey in it.
[00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:14.291]  It has great trends forecaster and political analyst Gerald Cilente.
[00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.212]  It has Willie Nelson.
[00:01:15.232 --> 00:01:16.233]  It has Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:21.878]  It has KRS-One, Professor Griff, myself, and many others in it.
[00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:30.805]  But Tarpley's really the main voice of the film, as he is in the new upcoming film, that's got John Perkins in it, and a bunch of other people I'm not even going to name at this time.
[00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.527]  I've never had a budget like this for a film.
[00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:39.572]  It's probably going to have like 15 big names in it, with their analysis, all on the same page, but different perspectives.
[00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.632]  So that is coming up in, that's going to come out October 1st.
[00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:47.092]  I've gone ahead and extended it because I was just going to throw a film out.
[00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:49.112]  It's still going to be hard-hitting, but I really want this.
[00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:53.013]  The Obama Deceptions are now rivaling loose change, folks.
[00:01:53.173 --> 00:02:08.616]  It is, I cannot describe to you, and we're going to Webster Tarpley, but I think he needs to hear this as well, that I've confirmed it's in Japanese newspapers and they're showing it to Japanese, not just film students, but economic and political science students, that entire universities
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:24.197]  This is in the South Korean news are showing it to all their students that multiple universities that I've been interviewed for magazines and they've told me over in South Korea and and and TV programs as well that
[00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:29.324]  That entire universities are showing it to entire student bodies.
[00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:32.465]  I mean, I've asked one newspaper reporter, I go, well, how many at this one school?
[00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.946]  Oh, hundreds of classes have been shown the Obama deception.
[00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:39.007]  And I'm just moving from the east to the west.
[00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:44.269]  Russia, Europe, everywhere, translated into more than ten languages that I've seen.
[00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:50.851]  Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, German, Dutch, French,
[00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:54.026]  Just, it's incredible.
[00:02:54.446 --> 00:03:01.491]  This is on track now to become the most downloaded, most viewed internet film in history.
[00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.491]  And we have no way of gauging it.
[00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:04.673]  Two months in, I checked it.
[00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:10.477]  There were 15 million views I could see.
[00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.858]  And I only spent 45 minutes going to the different sites.
[00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:17.141]  Million here, 2 million there, 3 million here, half a million here, 400,000 there.
[00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:18.282]  15 million!
[00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:21.284]  The peer-to-peer networks, the BitTorrents,
[00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:26.757]  Other language systems, thousands of video sites, I have no way of knowing.
[00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:29.377]  Just the copies of DVDs!
[00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:36.838]  Phoenix newspapers reported more than 15,000 given out by students at one Obama event when he came to speak.
[00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.519]  That's devastating!
[00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:50.541]  And videos of the students going wild, putting all their extra money, fundraisers, into buying 15,000 DVDs with mass burners, making copies, and now they're doing... I mean, it's just all over the country, all over the world,
[00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:56.443]  So that's why I said, look, I can't just throw another film out, even though I was doing it for speed, that was going to be good.
[00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:57.724]  This is going to be a masterpiece.
[00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:00.265]  I just am battling with myself over the name.
[00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:10.009]  So we'll talk to Webster when we get back about first, the spirit of resistance, the spirit of liberty, the spirit of believing you can stand up and getting animated in this fight.
[00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.969]  Knowing who your enemy is half the battle.
[00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.071]  Taking action and knowing you can't be stopped if you simply exert yourself as the other half.
[00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:26.700]  If you counter-strike the New World Order before it's too late, before their full panoptagon, their technological system is in place.
[00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:31.424]  So we'll kind of go to break here in a moment, come back with Webster Tarpley, but I just wanted you to know that
[00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:42.753]  In the second interview with Webster, and also in the first, we didn't put a lot about Iran and Pakistan and North Korea in the first one, because we wanted to have it simpler for the general public.
[00:04:43.194 --> 00:04:44.555]  The second one will have more on that.
[00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:45.996]  Everything he said came true.
[00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:52.521]  And it just gives me more and more respect for the foresight, the over-the-horizon analysis of Webster Griffin Tarperley.
[00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:56.083]  We're going to get two hours of that coming up after this break.
[00:04:56.404 --> 00:05:01.427]  His view on what's happening geopolitically, and then economically, and then inside the United States.
[00:05:02.328 --> 00:05:05.130]  As well, detailed analysis straight ahead.
[00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.011]  You don't want to miss this information.
[00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.012]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:13.735]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.656]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:19.718]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:19.898 --> 00:05:24.601]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:25.781]  If you simply prepare.
[00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:28.882]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:36.105]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:11.707]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:14.329]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:23.933]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:24.373]  We're good to go.
[00:07:43.107 --> 00:07:43.648]  I think so.
[00:08:08.482 --> 00:08:10.664]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:14.127]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:25.757]  Alright, Webster Griffin Tarpley is with us into the fourth hour today.
[00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:30.581]  So two plus hours, phone calls coming up later in the next hour with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:33.288]  I want to go over Iran.
[00:08:33.308 --> 00:08:35.950]  I want to go over Pakistan.
[00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.415]  I want to continue to move east into the Korean Peninsula.
[00:08:41.136 --> 00:08:43.398]  Why suddenly all this is starting and happening?
[00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:53.736]  I want to get into, then, what's happening with the economy and a lot more with the unauthorized biographer of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barack H. Obama.
[00:08:54.236 --> 00:09:01.361]  We carry both his books on barackhobama.infowars.com, on the secure online video bookstore shopping cart, I would add.
[00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:08.066]  Also, he is an award-winning economist and researcher, Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:16.610]  Webster, so much of what you said in the first Obama deception, now in the new film where we interviewed you a few months ago, is now coming true.
[00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.652]  So I want to get into how you knew their attack plan.
[00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:25.835]  I mean, I know what you're going to say, Brzezinski's been quite public and vocal about it, but still, to see them actually doing it is just amazing.
[00:09:26.195 --> 00:09:28.056]  What you think their next moves will be?
[00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:32.978]  Are things going well for the globalists, for the Anglo-American New World Order crime syndicate?
[00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:37.260]  Is their global game of grand chess board playing out the way they would have wanted to?
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.161]  How do we block them?
[00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.409]  And then what's happening with the economy.
[00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:43.362]  But first, I just want to share the good news with people.
[00:09:44.858 --> 00:09:47.520]  Folks out there have done an incredible job of the Obama deception.
[00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:54.327]  It is on track right now to rival any film ever released as being the most viral film in internet history.
[00:09:54.427 --> 00:10:01.093]  It is just, it is incalculable with the intelligence I have and the systems we have to even gauge it.
[00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:07.759]  Conservatively, again over 15 million views a month and a half ago when I last counted up just a few sites.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:18.403]  Just incalculable the DVDs being copied and given out worldwide, incalculable because it's so accurate and showed all his lies and stuff, what his next lies would be, and it's actually worse than we said.
[00:10:18.483 --> 00:10:27.465]  So the film, people are seeing it almost like revelation, and though it's not real revelation, they reveal what they would do before in their white papers as you know.
[00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:29.066]  So can you speak to
[00:10:30.222 --> 00:10:53.662]  People having faith in themselves, realizing we're at the global crossroads where they're trying to bring in the carbon tax tyranny, the total federalization of all water supply tyranny, the fascistic health care takeover tyranny, just on every front, militarily, you name it, we're at that flashpoint in history and it seems things are only accelerating.
[00:10:53.902 --> 00:10:54.843]  Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:10:55.543 --> 00:11:01.253]  Thank you, Alex, and congratulations to you on the tremendous success of this Obama deception.
[00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:07.223]  I think we've just come through a watershed in that I believe Obama has now peaked at least
[00:11:08.423 --> 00:11:15.445]  For the moment in terms of his ability to manipulate the United States population with his demagogy.
[00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:21.826]  You can see that his poll numbers are beginning to fall and in this he repeats the track of Carter.
[00:11:21.886 --> 00:11:31.608]  Now in the middle of that I think the Obama deception has been an important ingredient in catalyzing people to see what was going on in front of their noses.
[00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:33.789]  And one of my favorite
[00:11:35.353 --> 00:11:47.917]  Proverbs, I guess you could call it, is something I learned from a Spanish coal miner from the north of Spain, from the Asturias, and he said you have to remember that in this life you can either be active or you can be radioactive.
[00:11:48.618 --> 00:11:54.120]  In other words, you have to use political action to try to fend off and avoid the worst.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.861]  And I believe that remains absolutely valid today.
[00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:24.501]  And the other side of it, I think, is another good quote for people, if you're concerned with being political and continuing a struggle, even when it doesn't look so good, is you can have the pessimism of your intelligence, in other words, you can look around and say that the world is in very, very bad shape, and it often does, and it often looks like things are not very hopeful, shall we say.
[00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:33.122]  So the pessimism of the intelligence is fine, but then don't use that to drop out or, you know, relapse into just a mode of complaining.
[00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:41.044]  The optimism of the will, and I think optimism of the will is what you showed by putting out this Obama deception, right?
[00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:44.964]  At the time we taped that, it was the height of Obama-mania, right?
[00:12:44.984 --> 00:12:50.045]  It was the beginning of December of last year, as I recall, the part that I was in.
[00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:53.546]  Yeah, he had 80% approval ratings, God-like level.
[00:12:53.962 --> 00:13:01.748]  Right, it seemed like, you know, a small group of people going against the biggest demagogical exercise in world history, right?
[00:13:01.788 --> 00:13:08.633]  It seemed like an act of the most grotesque lunacy, but in reality I think it has had a significant effect, and I think it will have more.
[00:13:08.693 --> 00:13:20.002]  I think the audience for this can only grow, because the audience, as long as they were on this hysterical high of Obama-mania and utopian dreams and messianic illusions,
[00:13:20.522 --> 00:13:21.023]  Everywhere.
[00:13:21.923 --> 00:13:34.393]  People are probably not so interested, but I think as the problems become more obvious and as these illusions vanish, you know, it vanishes like at dawn and then comes the hangover.
[00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:38.676]  In the middle of the hangover, I think people are going to want to see exactly what has been done to them.
[00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:39.236]  No, you're right.
[00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:39.697]  That's key.
[00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:42.319]  In fact, that's the only point I meant to make and you're right.
[00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:43.740]  No, no, you're right.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.102]  It's growing, it's accelerating in its exponential explosion.
[00:13:48.162 --> 00:13:50.223]  That's what's really taking my breath away.
[00:13:50.243 --> 00:13:51.043]  Go ahead, Webster.
[00:13:52.264 --> 00:14:10.274]  I recommend political action, and I think the people... I got an email the other day from a guy in New York City, in Brooklyn, who is a big Obama supporter, and he'd been in the 9-11 truth movement, and he wrote me an email saying that he had
[00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:23.827]  He had been very wrong about Obama, and I thought this was probably one of the most committed Obama supporters in New York City, and he said, well, you know, I realize now that this was a mistake.
[00:14:24.367 --> 00:14:27.949]  And of course, you can understand why some people would make a mistake, right?
[00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:31.831]  A lot of people hated Hillary Clinton for various reasons, hated other people.
[00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:37.774]  Certainly, just about everybody decent hated Bush, so there were reasons why people made this
[00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:41.475]  And that was really what Obama built on, right?
[00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:48.537]  He was sort of judoing a situation where, you know, the other alternatives all seemed to be totally discredited.
[00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:53.419]  And he was new, and nobody knew anything about him, so why not give it a try?
[00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:56.700]  Well, unfortunately, not a good idea, as we're seeing now.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:06.103]  So I think the resistance is likely to grow, and I think a lot of people are having these moments of epiphany, right, where they realize that this was, that they've been duped, right?
[00:15:11.128 --> 00:15:11.829]  Absolutely.
[00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.715]  I want to get back into where you see Obama's future, how you see his crumbling unfolding.
[00:15:18.256 --> 00:15:20.538]  We talked during the break, you have the same concern as mine.
[00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:37.377]  implode until he's discredited as a fraud, a charlatan, a conman, false hope, a scam artist, puppet, unless they stage terror attacks or some type of Iranian crisis or North Korean situation.
[00:15:37.777 --> 00:15:44.261]  So let's start now on the geopolitical spectrum, moving first to Iran.
[00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:46.542]  Right, I think we can start with Iran because
[00:15:47.486 --> 00:15:51.929]  Iran is the big concern of the Carter administration, right?
[00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:59.413]  Remember that the Trilateral Commission is the common denominator of Carter and now of Obama, and indeed some of the people are the same.
[00:15:59.473 --> 00:16:09.539]  Paul Adolph Volcker was put into the Federal Reserve by Carter, and now we've got Paul Adolph Volcker sitting in the White House as the Director of Economic Recovery for Obama.
[00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:11.000]  A real amazing
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.060]  I think?
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:52.668]  Was the Iranian hostage crisis beginning in, what, January of 19... I'm sorry, in November of 1979, and then lasting for more than a year.
[00:16:52.768 --> 00:16:54.489]  That gave him the rally-round effect.
[00:16:54.529 --> 00:17:01.654]  So we've got to remember what Biden said in Seattle on the 19th of October, that there's going to be a crisis in the first six months.
[00:17:01.674 --> 00:17:02.654]  We'll see what that might be.
[00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:05.196]  But let's look for the moment at Iran.
[00:17:05.997 --> 00:17:07.758]  We just had Obama go to Cairo.
[00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.493]  And give this speech, right?
[00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:12.636]  It was really the second time Obama had done this.
[00:17:12.676 --> 00:17:24.331]  He had gone to Turkey some months before, in April, and given really the same kind of speech with a little bit less oomph, and with a certain, probably not as much hysteria around it.
[00:17:24.904 --> 00:17:27.847]  But there he was in Cairo, and he made this speech.
[00:17:27.927 --> 00:17:30.449]  Now, forget about the details of the speech.
[00:17:30.489 --> 00:17:36.695]  I think the main thing in the speech that was important was he had no economic perspective to offer.
[00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:46.845]  He had nothing about a Marshall Plan for the Middle East, nothing about rebuilding the war-torn economies of Gaza, of southern Lebanon, of Iraq.
[00:17:47.665 --> 00:17:52.268]  Uh, helping a place like Iran that has been hit by economic sanctions.
[00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:17.925]  None of that.
[00:18:18.005 --> 00:18:22.246]  It's all in the area of just rearranging the counters on the board.
[00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:31.768]  Now, after that, you had this election in Lebanon, where the Hezbollah were thought to be about to take over the Lebanese government, and they didn't.
[00:18:31.888 --> 00:18:40.410]  So it's Hezbollah and General Aoun, a Maronite Christian, a great Lebanese patriot, the guy that I would look to in Lebanese politics.
[00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:45.511]  They didn't quite get the majority, but they remained quite strong, and this was considered to be already
[00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:48.392]  A magical effect of Obama's speech.
[00:18:48.913 --> 00:19:01.240]  The main goal of Obama's speech, though, is to try to turn the Arabs and the Iranians, the Islamic world in the Middle East, against Russia and against China.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.361]  Because this is the essence of Obama's policy.
[00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:10.385]  It's an anti-Russian, anti-Chinese policy that tries to address the question of world domination
[00:19:11.146 --> 00:19:20.847]  Using other countries as pawns, kamikaze puppets, expendable assets, proxies, exercises in buck passing, and things like this.
[00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:24.160]  So that, I think, is now what's going on with Iran.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:42.175]  I mean, if you want to just put a headline over the Iranian situation, you could say that if you had regime change in Iran, one of the first things that a new puppet state in Iran, controlled by the US and the British, would do is to cut off the oil to China.
[00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:47.537]  And similarly, if you have a revolution in Saudi Arabia, they might have a revolution in Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:52.639]  The goal of that would be to cut off the oil to China, because that is the geopolitical sense of this entire thing.
[00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:53.459]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:00.542]  Again, they use revolution, whether it's anti-religious or pro-religious, it doesn't matter.
[00:20:00.862 --> 00:20:03.343]  They'll do it to break down and control any group they can.
[00:20:03.363 --> 00:20:07.725]  I want to look at the different characters involved in what's happening in Iran and where you see that going.
[00:20:07.825 --> 00:20:12.227]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain
[00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:20.162]  We're good.
[00:20:49.562 --> 00:20:50.243]  We're good.
[00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:10.275]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:10.695 --> 00:21:16.162]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:17.243]  That's right.
[00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:19.846]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:20.407 --> 00:21:27.335]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:35.560]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.882]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:46.524]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.305 --> 00:21:51.427]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:51.827 --> 00:21:52.067]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:56.869]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.490]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.131]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.191 --> 00:22:09.094]  It is a big idea.
[00:22:09.114 --> 00:22:11.215]  A new world order.
[00:22:11.935 --> 00:22:16.217]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:22:16.837 --> 00:22:19.618]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:19.658 --> 00:22:21.819]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.886]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:25.607 --> 00:22:32.941]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:35.953 --> 00:22:40.936]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:41.397 --> 00:22:44.859]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:47.761]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:47.841 --> 00:22:48.982]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:49.002 --> 00:22:49.782]  They're not after money.
[00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:50.883]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:51.083 --> 00:22:51.784]  They're after power.
[00:22:52.044 --> 00:22:52.904]  That's what they're after.

[00:23:52.725 --> 00:23:53.205]  I'm good.
[00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:26.414]  We are back live with Webster Griffin Tarpley with us well into the final hour.
[00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:30.538]  We'll have open phones coming up in the next hour.
[00:24:31.999 --> 00:24:37.225]  Webster, you get on the air and you're calmly talking about all of this and I think that's important.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.941]  To break it down.
[00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:42.223]  I want people to understand you've done deep research on all these subjects.
[00:24:42.784 --> 00:24:51.450]  I've done quite a bit of research as well to be able to even grasp the basics of what's going on.
[00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:53.012]  But I just want listeners to understand
[00:24:53.712 --> 00:24:55.353]  This is again a key crossroads.
[00:24:55.473 --> 00:24:57.755]  Very serious things are happening right now.
[00:24:58.155 --> 00:25:02.158]  Very serious things are being decided right now.
[00:25:02.638 --> 00:25:11.784]  And so I don't want to just talk about what their goals are in Iran or Pakistan or going west in Georgia or going east again in North Korea.
[00:25:13.035 --> 00:25:14.757]  I want to talk about where you see it going.
[00:25:14.777 --> 00:25:17.239]  I mean, is it going well for them?
[00:25:17.879 --> 00:25:23.224]  Just as a layman studying this, it looks like things aren't going well in Iran.
[00:25:23.264 --> 00:25:31.171]  The goal was to demonize Iran for military strikes, perhaps in the future, to kind of sell the outside world on that as one option.
[00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:35.575]  Another option is to try to put in the former
[00:25:36.598 --> 00:25:47.067]  Prime Minister, who was hooked into the CIA and different black ops, who's actually a hardliner and goes with the corrupt intermoolers, versus Ahmed Dinegide.
[00:25:48.671 --> 00:26:00.116]  And that they do want to install him, and he has been anti-Russia in the past, to kind of strike a deal with the Mulas, but certainly that deal has been rebuffed.
[00:26:00.456 --> 00:26:01.736]  It's not being accepted.
[00:26:01.756 --> 00:26:03.297]  I mean, this is very, very murky.
[00:26:03.357 --> 00:26:13.181]  We know the CIA and MI6 are on record in there fomenting this, and coming up with the classic color revolution, and admittedly doing it, but what are the goals?
[00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:14.221]  Are they going well?
[00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:15.261]  Who are the factions?
[00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:16.762]  Because people want to hear that from you.
[00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:23.913]  Well, remember the Brzezinski tradition, and this is just normal imperialism, right?
[00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:28.020]  The neocons make you forget what a normal imperialist looks like.
[00:26:28.897 --> 00:26:34.624]  The Brzezinski tradition is you don't attack anybody, you sit back and play other countries one against the other.
[00:26:34.644 --> 00:26:36.646]  They have a name for this, it's called buck passing.
[00:26:37.107 --> 00:26:42.112]  In other words, if you want to do something bad to China, don't do it yourself, because there might be blowback.
[00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:43.754]  You get somebody else to do it.
[00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:49.421]  So if you can get Iran to cut off the oil to China, or if you can get Iran into some hostile relation,
[00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:51.982]  With Russia, then that's what you want to do.
[00:26:52.062 --> 00:27:00.124]  And I think that's... Destabilization, Balkanization, wind-up toys, the word you use is good, kamikazes.
[00:27:00.684 --> 00:27:02.024]  This is the great game, isn't it?
[00:27:02.464 --> 00:27:03.164]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:03.224 --> 00:27:08.526]  So, as you say, it's a color revolution, it's a people power coup, it's a velvet revolution.
[00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:13.847]  And there was some guy from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Pasteran, who had an article
[00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:23.517]  About in a week before the election saying that what's going to happen is an attempt at a velvet revolution and people power coup by the CIA and we won't let it happen.
[00:27:23.557 --> 00:27:25.638]  No, I think they're not doing well with this.
[00:27:26.198 --> 00:27:28.440]  I think there was a hysterical group
[00:27:29.142 --> 00:27:34.925]  And it's called the Soft Power Group in the US foreign policy community.
[00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:40.968]  The Soft Power Group says, we don't want the neocons and their stupid military methods.
[00:27:41.028 --> 00:27:45.770]  We want to use trickery, guile, subversion, soft power.
[00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.191]  We can do more with less.
[00:27:47.651 --> 00:27:54.254]  We can do more imperialist dirty work with less losses and certainly less expense and less
[00:27:54.935 --> 00:27:56.156]  Pure political problems.
[00:27:56.716 --> 00:28:05.162]  And that would be this group around Joseph Nye, who was one of the... He sees Nye as kind of an interface between the Trilaterals and the Bilderbergers.
[00:28:05.522 --> 00:28:06.863]  Big supporter for Obama.
[00:28:06.903 --> 00:28:09.825]  He was blogging for Obama on the Huffington Post.
[00:28:09.845 --> 00:28:11.306]  So, the soft power group.
[00:28:11.326 --> 00:28:13.067]  And now, let's look at what they've got.
[00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:19.431]  If you want to have a color revolution, you've got to have a telegenic demagogue who gets out there and leads.
[00:28:19.512 --> 00:28:21.013]  And this they don't really seem to have.
[00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:22.974]  I mean, somebody like Obama himself or
[00:28:23.726 --> 00:28:31.311]  You can see that telegenic is a flexible term when you get somebody like Yushchenko in Ukraine, right?
[00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:32.992]  He's not exactly telegenic.
[00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:39.056]  Maybe Saakashvili in Georgia maybe looked more telegenic at the beginning.
[00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:44.920]  Anyway, they have a problem in the sense that they don't have a leader who's willing to get out there and bet the ranch.
[00:28:44.981 --> 00:28:46.722]  The other thing you need, of course, is a color.
[00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:47.963]  In Iran, they have it.
[00:28:48.003 --> 00:28:48.623]  It's green.
[00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:49.904]  They have a slogan.
[00:28:49.924 --> 00:28:52.706]  The slogan is something like, yes, we can, as I understand it.
[00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.528]  You've got to have control of the TV and the media.
[00:28:55.588 --> 00:28:57.890]  Now, inside Iran, they don't have it.
[00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.813]  The state television, of course, is pro-Akhmedinejad.
[00:29:02.153 --> 00:29:05.256]  Satellite TV, though, is going to be anti-regime.
[00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:10.180]  It's interesting, the British just began a special television channel
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.021]  No.
[00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:11.241]  Yeah.
[00:29:31.593 --> 00:29:45.283]  So, uh, that they had up to a point largely through the intervention of the CIA Covert Action Program with the $400 million for communications, for Twitter, for cell phones, and all the rest of this stuff.
[00:29:45.303 --> 00:29:46.464]  So that they had up to a point.
[00:29:46.504 --> 00:29:47.164]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:29:47.184 --> 00:29:48.045]  Stay there.
[00:29:48.085 --> 00:29:49.646]  Quick break, long segment coming up.
[00:29:50.186 --> 00:29:51.747]  Let's continue to break this down.
[00:29:52.428 --> 00:29:54.369]  On the other side, we're with Westford Griffin Tarpley.
[00:29:54.869 --> 00:29:57.972]  We've got both his books on Obama, by the way, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:58.032 --> 00:29:58.952]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.413 --> 00:30:00.914]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.912 --> 00:30:04.714]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.295 --> 00:30:12.858]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.

[00:31:07.462 --> 00:31:12.464]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:31:12.664 --> 00:31:16.466]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:16.706 --> 00:31:22.289]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:23.050]  It's true.
[00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.453]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:28.594 --> 00:31:34.039]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.542]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:31:37.782 --> 00:31:42.006]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:45.909]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:31:46.129 --> 00:31:51.634]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:31:51.874 --> 00:31:56.438]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:56.578 --> 00:31:58.120]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.682]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:12.693]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[00:32:13.021 --> 00:32:17.104]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[00:32:17.505 --> 00:32:21.628]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to NuRev.
[00:32:21.928 --> 00:32:27.893]  NuRev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient, resveratrol.
[00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:38.442]  Resveratrol is the main nutrient found in red wine and has been proven to help slow down the aging process, help you lose weight, override an unhealthy lifestyle, boost your energy level.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.080]  I think so.
[00:33:24.172 --> 00:33:32.531]  The great game out of the Globalist, the New World Order, the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:33:33.865 --> 00:33:35.406]  I mean we're going back to pre-
[00:34:04.468 --> 00:34:05.048]  1860s here.
[00:34:05.408 --> 00:34:20.672]  Going back to Webster Tarpley in a moment to continue with Iran, then North Korea, as we go around the world and look at what's really happening, and then we'll look at the economy as well with our guest, who has a great track record of analyzing and breaking all this down in extremely accurate fashion.
[00:34:21.053 --> 00:34:24.233]  Before I go any further, though, I'll tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[00:34:24.594 --> 00:34:25.594]  One of them is Home Game.
[00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:32.655]  This is a place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, or getting any real estate questions answered, and it's absolutely free.
[00:34:33.255 --> 00:34:38.518]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com, homegain.com, and see what I'm talking about.
[00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:42.181]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you will get a free estimate.
[00:34:42.941 --> 00:34:43.361]  We're good to go.
[00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:05.052]  There is a new feature called Street View, where you can look at the house at street level and take a virtual walk-through tour of the neighborhood you're interested in.
[00:35:05.452 --> 00:35:07.672]  You've got to see it for yourself, and again, it's all free.
[00:35:08.012 --> 00:35:12.373]  There are tons of tools to help you, for instance, and if you want to remodel your home, go to HomeGain.com.
[00:35:12.793 --> 00:35:18.735]  Use their Home Sale Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[00:35:19.035 --> 00:35:20.195]  It's HomeGain.com.
[00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:27.712]  And one other sponsor I wanted to tell you about this hour is eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:35:28.612 --> 00:35:31.953]  This is the place to get high-quality, storable foods for insurance.
[00:35:31.973 --> 00:35:47.657]  You know, you buy insurance for floods and insurance for hurricanes or tornadoes or storms or fire, but in this depression we're going into, in this urban society with almost no one being self-sufficient, no one having really gardens unless it's a slave garden with your children working for the federal government,
[00:35:48.547 --> 00:35:52.913]  We need to have storable food, and this is who I get my storable food from.
[00:35:53.794 --> 00:35:55.616]  I was buying food from them before they were a sponsor.
[00:35:56.037 --> 00:36:00.983]  eFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[00:36:01.003 --> 00:36:01.243]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[00:36:05.408 --> 00:36:07.150]  5, 6, 3, 3 or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:14.658]  Call and get a free brochure or watch the videos online about all their high quality food products and they have other things like stoves and water filters and stuff.
[00:36:14.678 --> 00:36:16.960]  It's just a great site, efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.082]  And then lastly, we have an online video.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.642]  And bookstore shopping cart.
[00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:28.827]  It's a video store, a bookstore, all the best films and books that I read that I think are important.
[00:36:29.268 --> 00:36:30.309]  The best films I see.
[00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.273]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:38.160]  We've got a lot of t-shirts that spread the word about the New World Order and fighting the globalists.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.002]  If you want to meet like-minded people.
[00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:48.706]  If you want to reach out to folks in your community, well then wear your colors on your sleeve, on your back.
[00:36:49.127 --> 00:36:59.071]  Infowars.com is a whole bunch of anti-New World Order, pro-1776, anti-slavery material, and of course all of the films like Endgame,
[00:36:59.631 --> 00:37:03.375]  And Maafa, 21, Black Genocide in 21st Century America.
[00:37:03.655 --> 00:37:08.039]  I want to go over some eugenics and this whole Green Movement with Webster as well before he leaves us.
[00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:11.282]  Now, going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:37:12.203 --> 00:37:13.444]  Webster, okay, you got the floor.
[00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:23.813]  I'm going to sit back here, continue with the different players in Iran, where you see this going, how that's going, and then let's move to other battlefronts, like what you see really going on in Pakistan,
[00:37:25.075 --> 00:37:40.526]  versus what's happening in North Korea because it's as if someone flipped a light switch and global crises in a fiery crescent from Eastern Europe into the Korean Peninsula just suddenly lit up in flames as well as Africa.
[00:37:42.127 --> 00:37:44.289]  Yes, well, just on Iran now.
[00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.454]  If you come out and say that the revolution in Iran is being run through Twitter
[00:37:51.201 --> 00:37:57.167]  That already implies a very specific class composition of who is out there revolting.
[00:37:58.048 --> 00:38:00.230]  A lot of people in Iran don't even have a phone.
[00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.872]  A lot of people in Iran have never made a phone call.
[00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:06.656]  The people who have access to the internet are maybe 20-25%.
[00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:07.697]  That would be my guess.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:26.369]  So if you say that the golden youth, the privileged youthful students of Tehran University are demanding the overthrow of the regime, this is a social stratum that is essentially demanding more privileges for itself.
[00:38:26.509 --> 00:38:32.433]  These are people who believe in economic globalization, they're big on free market.
[00:38:33.093 --> 00:38:38.076]  For example, this guy Mousavi is demanding privatization of the state sector.
[00:38:38.576 --> 00:38:44.201]  A typical IMF, International Monetary Fund, shock therapy demand.
[00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:46.303]  He's demanding freedom on the Internet.
[00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:53.269]  Well, to the average peasant or poor worker, there's no such thing as freedom on the Internet, because they don't have the Internet.
[00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:58.453]  And I think this points to the limitation of what they're doing in Iran.
[00:38:58.493 --> 00:39:04.819]  It reminds me a little bit of the Cedars Revolution that they tried in Lebanon a little while ago, where you had the rich
[00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:18.865]  Uh, Christian Maronite Jet Set driving up in Porsches and BMWs, if not Rolls Royces and Lamborghinis, and saying, oh, we're really hurting, we've got to get, you know, we've got to get Hezbollah out of Lebanon.
[00:39:18.905 --> 00:39:20.426]  It's this kind of a situation.
[00:39:20.806 --> 00:39:25.868]  The support for Mousavi is largely in North Tehran, which is like saying,
[00:39:26.568 --> 00:39:31.151]  You know, Park Avenue, or Beverly Hills, or the Gold Coast of Chicago.
[00:39:31.171 --> 00:39:33.133]  In other words, a very rich neighborhood.
[00:39:33.173 --> 00:39:41.299]  So, it's rich elitists who like Mousavi, and you can get enough of them to go out on the street and drag some others with them.
[00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:49.925]  And the desperate housewives, because the desperate housewives are fascinated by the wife of Mousavi, who's a lady with some kind of
[00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:52.048]  Academic background.
[00:39:52.368 --> 00:39:53.409]  She's an academic dean.
[00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:54.870]  And now, this is the problem.
[00:39:54.910 --> 00:40:03.577]  The very narrow base of support for the U.S.-British candidate, Mousavi, normally you have to have a public opinion poll.
[00:40:03.857 --> 00:40:11.463]  The classic way you do a color revolution is an oppressive regime has an election, and then you get your swarming adolescents.
[00:40:11.483 --> 00:40:19.490]  You get your rent-a-mob and dupe-a-mob of young people and rich elitists out in the streets, camping in the main square of Kiev, things like this.
[00:40:20.265 --> 00:40:25.650]  And they demand the overturning of the election, as they're doing now, based on the idea that vote fraud took place.
[00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.792]  Well, how can you prove vote fraud?
[00:40:28.152 --> 00:40:30.134]  In this case, there's absolutely no proof.
[00:40:30.214 --> 00:40:33.456]  There's no suggestion of how you can prove vote fraud.
[00:40:33.737 --> 00:40:38.861]  They say, well, such and such a candidate came from this region and he didn't win it.
[00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:41.583]  Well, you know, Al Gore lost Tennessee.
[00:40:41.804 --> 00:40:42.324]  Big deal.
[00:40:42.684 --> 00:40:46.808]  It's very easy for people to lose the area that they come from if the opponent is
[00:40:47.269 --> 00:40:47.892]  Is popular.
[00:40:48.273 --> 00:40:51.386]  So the vote fraud scenario...
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:41:06.566]  Suffers from the fact that they don't have a poll, and the polls that they do have show, uh, Ahmadinejad shows the regime candidate winning by about two to one, so about two-thirds of the votes for Ahmadinejad, and that's about what you have.
[00:41:06.686 --> 00:41:16.509]  So, I think on the whole, this is not gonna be very, very successful, and I think the, uh, the really sinister thing again is, if Mousavi got in, what would he do?
[00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:18.350]  Let's look at, let's look at Mousavi.
[00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.351]  This is the butcher of Beirut.
[00:41:20.391 --> 00:41:25.554]  This is one of the most hardline Islamic fascists, to use the neocon terms.
[00:41:25.634 --> 00:41:28.336]  If anybody is an Islamic fascist, it's him.
[00:41:28.696 --> 00:41:33.198]  But always you see the globalists, the CIMI6, cozying up to these butchers.
[00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:35.240]  He represents the old line.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.881]  He represents the old line.
[00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:39.502]  Wealthy, corrupt, that Ahmadinejad is fighting.
[00:41:39.762 --> 00:41:42.364]  I'm not saying Ahmadinejad is any angel, but this guy
[00:41:43.024 --> 00:41:46.228]  You know, actually, you can tell by his actions, he really believes he's doing the right thing.
[00:41:46.248 --> 00:41:56.080]  You're right, he's popular with the people, but the little CIA-funded kids... The only way I see this working, but I want your take on this, so I'm interrupting Webster, because I want to hear what you have to say on this.
[00:41:57.475 --> 00:41:59.877]  And this is what Paul Greg Roberts and others are saying, and I agree with them.
[00:42:00.258 --> 00:42:16.131]  The only real reason they went with this is, maybe it's going to work to overthrow him, if he stabilizes them, period, and discredits them in the world's eyes, if Israel goes ahead and blows their nuke reactors to kingdom come, that, oh well, the regime deserved it.
[00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:19.354]  This is some type of demonization campaign.
[00:42:19.694 --> 00:42:21.236]  Now, do you agree with that, or am I wrong?
[00:42:21.843 --> 00:42:26.626]  Well, I think their maximum option was to try to overthrow the regime and put in a puppet state.
[00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:33.390]  The other thing, let me talk in a minute about the idea of busting up Iran, because that's their real strategy.
[00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:45.578]  Mousavi, as you say, is this Prime Minister from the 1980s, and for me the thing that sums it all up is, during the Iran-Iraq War, started by the U.S., of course, in 1980-1981,
[00:42:48.365 --> 00:42:54.810]  You had the mullahs, who are not good people to say the least, going around and getting children.
[00:42:54.870 --> 00:43:00.274]  They would take children, fairly young children, away from their parents and get them to go to the front.
[00:43:00.715 --> 00:43:12.944]  And they would give them a stick or some little weapon that was really no weapon at all, maybe a knife or some silly little thing, and then send them up against the machine guns of the Iraqi army.
[00:43:13.704 --> 00:43:15.306]  It was like a children's crusade.
[00:43:15.806 --> 00:43:17.828]  Now, Mousavi was the prime minister
[00:43:18.388 --> 00:43:26.898]  Who presided over human wave attacks by young children who had been taken away from their parents by these mullahs.
[00:43:26.978 --> 00:43:29.100]  So this is what he represents.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.204]  And he of course is a tool of this guy Rafsanjani.
[00:43:32.284 --> 00:43:33.045]  Rafsanjani
[00:43:33.823 --> 00:43:35.824]  Is one of the most corrupt people in the world.
[00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:41.826]  Rafsanjani could compete with Zardari there in Pakistan in terms of corruption.
[00:43:41.866 --> 00:43:46.467]  He's an extreme corrupt manifestation of the old regime.
[00:43:46.507 --> 00:43:49.088]  So Rafsanjani, who is the oldest
[00:43:49.768 --> 00:43:55.350]  Most discredited, most corrupt representative of this entire theocracy.
[00:43:55.550 --> 00:44:01.792]  But again, the theocracy was set up by Carter and Brzezinski during the Carter administration, right?
[00:44:01.832 --> 00:44:03.933]  They installed Khomeini, that's what they wanted.
[00:44:04.353 --> 00:44:10.175]  They wanted Islamic fundamentalism as a bulwark against Soviet communism, and by God, they got it.
[00:44:10.775 --> 00:44:16.199]  So, Rafsanjani is the spirit of Khomeini living on, and that's Mousavi.
[00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:18.720]  So this is now, in the eyes of the U.S.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:25.845]  and the British, this is now a wonderful reformer, and his wonderful supporters are these people that everybody should support.
[00:44:25.905 --> 00:44:28.647]  I think this is going, probably going nowhere.
[00:44:29.187 --> 00:44:32.970]  And therefore, that's a defeat for Obama, because remember, the argument for Obama was
[00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:42.273]  That this wonderful personality, this dazzling smile of Obama would transform the world through magical powers, right?
[00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:46.235]  Obama would gesture hypnotically and the regime in Iran would fall.
[00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:52.277]  And again, the soft power people wanted the argument of saying, don't attack Iran, don't attack Iran.
[00:44:52.597 --> 00:44:55.858]  We can deal with Iran using these methods.
[00:44:55.898 --> 00:44:58.059]  Now, they have shaken the regime.
[00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:00.419]  But I don't know what's going to come out of it.
[00:45:00.439 --> 00:45:07.781]  I mean, it's, you know, Tiananmen was certainly not as, it was more extreme than what we've seen here, and that did not work in China.
[00:45:07.821 --> 00:45:16.503]  So it doesn't look, it looks like the color revolution people power coup model is getting to be so well known that you can take measures against it, right?
[00:45:16.523 --> 00:45:20.584]  The Iranians have cut off Twitter and cut off parts of the internet and so forth.
[00:45:21.284 --> 00:45:24.384]  So I think they knew what was coming, and they were ready for it.
[00:45:24.424 --> 00:45:27.385]  Now, in terms of the long-term CIA stuff,
[00:45:27.905 --> 00:45:44.989]  The journalists today ignore the fact that Bush, in May of 2007, with great fanfare, Bush signed a $400 million program to subvert Iran using communications and other, used to be fax machines, now it's Twitter, cell phones,
[00:45:45.249 --> 00:45:48.890]  And more importantly, that was done publicly for a color revolution.
[00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.990]  They said to get the students to try to overthrow the government, an act of war.
[00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.011]  And I want you to continue, but for the folks that don't know, this is on record.
[00:45:56.031 --> 00:46:01.712]  We've written a bunch of articles at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, previous to this latest big flare-up.
[00:46:02.132 --> 00:46:07.053]  They tried this actually back in 2004, the year after they'd taken over Iraq.
[00:46:07.393 --> 00:46:11.354]  There were some bombings and riots and things, and then they started, even before 2007,
[00:46:12.754 --> 00:46:31.290]  Hiring four groups, and you always go over that Webster, and then I want to move back to the current time and into the future, but you're really an expert on the four groups, one of them Kurdish, three of them connected in to Sunni, Wahhabist, and number three in Al Qaeda working for CIA, but then also
[00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:40.897]  One of the groups that work for Saddam, they've got, that's five groups, bombing mosques, blowing up school buses, shooting police, and Iran has sued the United States.
[00:46:41.278 --> 00:46:43.159]  The West admits they're staging attacks.
[00:46:43.179 --> 00:46:46.322]  Can you imagine if Iran was staging weekly attacks here for years?
[00:46:46.382 --> 00:46:55.909]  So, it's not just 2007 with the shift from paramilitary attacks to getting the students ready for now what's happening, and then the facts of also how
[00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:02.512]  The mullahs can appoint who's gonna run anyway, so why would they steal an election when they rig who gets to run anyway?
[00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:10.075]  So, I mean, it's just unbelievable, but how terrorists, including Al-Qaeda, openly work for the U.S.
[00:47:10.115 --> 00:47:20.259]  and England, and then they think our public is so stupid, Webster, they tell us Iran is Al-Qaeda, when it's the opposite religious group of Islam.
[00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:23.480]  I mean, this is like saying Superman is Lex Luthor.
[00:47:24.116 --> 00:47:24.917]  Yeah, the U.S.
[00:47:24.957 --> 00:47:30.061]  Congress, of course, has passed, repeatedly passed, regime change laws concerning Iran.
[00:47:30.081 --> 00:47:34.064]  In other words, a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
[00:47:34.504 --> 00:47:38.707]  Now remember, Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker has been writing articles since, what, 2004, 2005?
[00:47:41.429 --> 00:47:42.790]  Saying, the U.S.
[00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:50.316]  has special forces teams, terrorist controllers, saboteurs, political operatives on the ground in Iran, and they do.
[00:47:50.736 --> 00:48:02.205]  We have Brett Scowcroft, a gray eminence of the ruling elite, has given an interview quite recently which says, of course we have all kinds of CIA personnel on the ground.
[00:48:02.265 --> 00:48:08.150]  And that gets us into then the, I think that the reasonable scenario for Iran is, if you had Mousavi take over,
[00:48:08.948 --> 00:48:14.431]  That would leave Mousavi as the Prime Minister of what they call Iranistan.
[00:48:14.532 --> 00:48:20.655]  Iranistan would be sort of the central part of Iran, Tehran and Qom and some other large cities.
[00:48:20.715 --> 00:48:27.580]  But then, as you mentioned now, the CIA and the British, MI6 especially, they have these other groups, right?
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.581]  You have the Jundullah terrorists.
[00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:36.644]  Operating in Balochistan, that would be southeast Iran, coming in sometimes from Pakistan.
[00:48:37.084 --> 00:48:46.287]  They have terrorists coming from Afghanistan into the area in the northeast, that would be Pashtunistan, that would be another component.
[00:48:46.768 --> 00:48:52.490]  Then they have in the north, they have Azeris, they have Kurds.
[00:48:53.317 --> 00:48:55.199]  And then they have this Arabistan.
[00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:57.362]  This is where the British have invested a lot.
[00:48:57.802 --> 00:49:05.771]  Arabistan or Akhvaz is the coast of Iran along the Persian Gulf or Arabian Gulf.
[00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:06.752]  The Gulf, I guess.
[00:49:07.395 --> 00:49:15.340]  And that's the area of the Abadan refinery, the Karg Island tanker terminal, the oil fields, sort of south of a chain of mountains.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:33.451]  And here, for a long time, the British have sponsored what I call the BP Liberation Front, British Petroleum Liberation Front, because it is an open attempt to detach from Greater Iran the parts that the British used to control and used to be their main source of oil.
[00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:37.315]  They want to slice the big port and oil field away, so Iran has trouble.
[00:49:37.575 --> 00:49:39.597]  And then you mentioned the MEK, right?
[00:49:39.617 --> 00:49:46.425]  The Mujahideen-e-Khalq is an army with tanks, with all kinds of weapons that the U.S.
[00:49:46.465 --> 00:49:52.611]  has and continues to protect inside an enclave on the Iraqi side, but these people can be sent over.
[00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:54.794]  So if you add up al-Qaeda,
[00:49:55.854 --> 00:50:03.896]  In that Pashtunistan area, you've got Jundullah in the Balochistan area, you've got Mujahideen-e-Khalq, you've got this Akhvaz Liberation Front.
[00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:08.357]  You've got four or five different terrorist groups that are being fomented by the U.S.
[00:50:08.417 --> 00:50:08.937]  and the British.
[00:50:09.257 --> 00:50:16.039]  And the background to the entire thing, they say, if you turn on CNN, they say, well, the economy under Ahmadinejad is bad.
[00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.459]  Yeah, there are sanctions!
[00:50:17.799 --> 00:50:21.060]  There are draconian economic sanctions, practically a blockade!
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:31.845]  I don't know why Ahmadinejad doesn't get up there like Castro and say, you know, comrades or brothers in Islam, our economy is bad because we're under economic blockade.
[00:50:32.365 --> 00:50:35.807]  And I suppose he does say that, but that is one of the realities.
[00:50:35.847 --> 00:50:43.271]  Now, Ahmadinejad is of course a populist demagogue with a lot of bluster, but in terms of an election, it really looks like he won it.
[00:50:44.051 --> 00:50:44.612]  Yeah, certainly.
[00:50:44.652 --> 00:50:45.353]  We have U.S.
[00:50:45.373 --> 00:50:55.624]  poll companies saying 2-1 and then the other clown announces he's won hours before the polls close to create the perception of a stolen election when he loses.
[00:50:56.245 --> 00:51:00.109]  Webster, do you think he knows he's working with the CIA or do they want to put him in?
[00:51:00.129 --> 00:51:02.612]  I think he's probably a winning actor.
[00:51:03.752 --> 00:51:04.493]  Alright, stay there.
[00:51:04.953 --> 00:51:06.935]  We'll come back and get into other areas of the world.
[00:51:19.889 --> 00:51:20.509]  We're good to go!
[00:51:36.715 --> 00:51:36.915]  I think so.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:13.386]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:14.173 --> 00:52:19.515]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:20.055 --> 00:52:26.257]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:26.537 --> 00:52:28.378]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:28.538 --> 00:52:30.918]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:30.998 --> 00:52:41.882]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:44.176 --> 00:52:45.437]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:45.837 --> 00:52:47.238]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:54.001]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:53:02.865 --> 00:53:04.006]  The Obama Deception.
[00:53:04.446 --> 00:53:05.627]  The people strike back.
[00:53:07.193 --> 00:53:08.694]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:53:08.874 --> 00:53:10.315]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:53:10.615 --> 00:53:12.857]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:53:13.297 --> 00:53:18.040]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:21.282]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:53:21.623 --> 00:53:25.125]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:37.520]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.061]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:41.382]  I use one every day.
[00:53:41.802 --> 00:53:44.263]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:53:44.543 --> 00:53:45.344]  Come, you masters of war!
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:27.961]  I think if you boil it all down in the last 45-50 minutes talking to Webster Tarpley, he's coming to the same...
[00:54:29.704 --> 00:54:33.505]  Perspective and summation that I've come to and many of us have.
[00:54:33.985 --> 00:54:37.587]  The globalists have the high ground financially, but not morally.
[00:54:37.627 --> 00:54:41.368]  They have the power, they have the money, but it's a losing game.
[00:54:41.508 --> 00:54:43.308]  Time is on our side.
[00:54:43.348 --> 00:54:51.771]  Those of us that want human liberty and freedom and upward mobility and goals for society and, you know, where decency and truthfulness is honored.
[00:54:52.151 --> 00:54:54.272]  Not just this capitulation to lies and evil.
[00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:58.133]  And that on every front the New World Order is failing.
[00:54:58.513 --> 00:55:03.535]  They're grinding down to their axles like Napoleon in Russia.
[00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:05.736]  Or Hitler in Russia.
[00:55:06.437 --> 00:55:09.939]  But they got a lot of tricks up their sleeves, namely stage terror.
[00:55:09.959 --> 00:55:19.003]  And that's why we now get into North Korea, Pakistan, conflict with Russia, the encirclement, all of that continuing.
[00:55:20.024 --> 00:55:22.165]  But Webster, one final note on
[00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:30.082]  One final note on Iran, and we'll get into stage crises, North Korea being chief among them, I would imagine will be your view, but we'll see.
[00:55:31.622 --> 00:55:35.564]  And that is the... Have you ever seen one that lies as much as Obama?
[00:55:35.604 --> 00:55:38.925]  I mean, we know presidents lie a lot, and that's just part of what they do.
[00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:41.526]  Unfortunately, it's become just business as usual.
[00:55:41.827 --> 00:55:49.090]  But with him, it's the over-the-topness, saying there's no CIA doing anything in Iran, there's no involvement.
[00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:59.153]  While his bosses, Brzezinski and Kissinger, and you mentioned Skrokov, are on TV bragging how they're running it all and calling it delicate manipulation.
[00:55:59.213 --> 00:56:00.953]  I mean, and that's another question.
[00:56:01.033 --> 00:56:05.275]  Why do they go on TV and admit they're behind it, but then he gets up and lies?
[00:56:05.335 --> 00:56:08.216]  Is that just part of the flaunting it in our face?
[00:56:08.256 --> 00:56:09.256]  They think we're a bunch of idiots?
[00:56:09.983 --> 00:56:18.914]  I think Obama has a much bigger audience, and then when somebody like Brent Scowcroft speaks, that doesn't exactly get on the evening news.
[00:56:19.254 --> 00:56:20.035]  But you're certainly right.
[00:56:20.716 --> 00:56:26.603]  With Bush, we had a brutal aggressor, an imperialist reactionary.
[00:56:27.327 --> 00:56:28.207]  And he was frank.
[00:56:28.568 --> 00:56:30.749]  As he always said, you know exactly where I stand.
[00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:31.269]  Yeah, we did.
[00:56:31.649 --> 00:56:35.831]  He had this thin veil of pro-democracy, neocon rhetoric.
[00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:40.794]  But you could already see that, you know, the intent, which was just aggression, right?
[00:56:40.834 --> 00:56:41.454]  Imperialism.
[00:56:41.494 --> 00:56:44.676]  And he would say things like, bring it on, or dead or alive.
[00:56:45.216 --> 00:56:46.837]  So that's Bush.
[00:56:46.917 --> 00:56:49.138]  But now Obama's a completely different method.
[00:56:49.558 --> 00:56:52.640]  This is now systematic, strategic deception.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.341]  Dissembling.
[00:56:54.981 --> 00:57:04.764]  Fakery, lying, duping people, mass brainwashing, and according to some, even mass hypnosis, or the attempt at mass hypnosis.
[00:57:04.944 --> 00:57:06.744]  No, no, he's definitely doing that stuff.
[00:57:06.784 --> 00:57:09.405]  They have corporate classes on that.
[00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.986]  People used to tell me about it a decade ago, I didn't believe it.
[00:57:12.006 --> 00:57:13.386]  They really teach him how to do that.
[00:57:13.806 --> 00:57:19.253]  Yeah, you know, there was Count Cagliostro and the French Revolution could hypnotize crowds.
[00:57:19.313 --> 00:57:21.255]  I guess that's what Obama's trying to do.
[00:57:21.576 --> 00:57:26.923]  One of the mountain banks of the French Revolution is now reincarnated in Obama.
[00:57:26.963 --> 00:57:31.989]  So, the point, though, is that his method is this deception.
[00:57:33.448 --> 00:57:36.593]  I think as long as that holds up, it looks like it's going well.
[00:57:36.633 --> 00:57:41.240]  But then, as they used to say in Vietnam, it will become polluted by reality.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.527]  You know, all the promises that Lyndon Johnson made eventually crashed to the ground.
[00:57:46.587 --> 00:57:47.989]  Of course, he was a much less clever
[00:57:48.767 --> 00:57:52.109]  Uh, uh, practitioner of, of deception than Obama.
[00:57:52.149 --> 00:57:53.949]  So, people have got to change gears, right?
[00:57:53.969 --> 00:57:55.410]  You're no longer dealing with Bush.
[00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:56.110]  Bush is gone.
[00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:00.893]  I know a lot of leftists that I know are still hanging on to this idea that Bush is their main enemy.
[00:58:00.913 --> 00:58:03.094]  Well, that's, uh, that's long gone.
[00:58:03.434 --> 00:58:07.876]  So, you're now dealing with Obama and his method is, is this, uh, lying and so forth.
[00:58:08.236 --> 00:58:12.598]  And therefore, the, the idea of exposing him, like what you do in, uh, the Obama deception,
[00:58:12.998 --> 00:58:14.619]  This becomes one of the main things.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:21.865]  In other words, simply the loud statement of the truth is practically revolutionary when you're dealing with somebody like Obama.
[00:58:22.186 --> 00:58:23.207]  All right, stay there, stay there.
[00:58:23.227 --> 00:58:24.648]  We're going to come back in one minute, Webster.
[00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:25.448]  We're at a third hour.
[00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:27.190]  We've got plenty of time with you today.
[00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:30.072]  We're very honored and very thankful that you're spending so much time with us.
[00:58:30.613 --> 00:58:34.916]  Webster Griffin Tarbley, and we'll tell you about his books and other materials on the other side.
[00:58:35.216 --> 00:58:38.799]  But yes, it was George Orwell that said, in an age of universal deceit,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.382]  Telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:58:41.842 --> 00:58:46.866]  So I think that's a nice addendum or dessert to what Webster just said.
[00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:51.110]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.051 --> 00:58:54.353]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:56.909 --> 00:58:58.010]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:00.072]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:59:00.292 --> 00:59:00.933]  Well, you should.
[00:59:01.273 --> 00:59:05.538]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:59:05.758 --> 00:59:06.238]  That's right.
[00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:15.027]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:59:15.227 --> 00:59:16.489]  All for pennies on the dollar.

[00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:23.554]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.

[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.042]  Waging war on corruption.

[01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:12.430]  Big Brother.
[01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:14.052]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:14.839 --> 01:00:15.919]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.400]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.061]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.081 --> 01:00:23.402]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.922 --> 01:00:27.964]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.425 --> 01:00:32.226]  We're back live.
[01:00:32.306 --> 01:00:36.429]  Thank you so much for joining us on this 25th day of June 2009.
[01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:38.771]  This Thursday edition.
[01:00:39.412 --> 01:00:41.494]  Webster with us for another hour and a half.
[01:00:41.954 --> 01:00:44.216]  Opening the phones up at the bottom of this hour.
[01:00:44.897 --> 01:00:50.261]  We'll just go ahead and do it now.
[01:00:50.281 --> 01:00:50.341]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:51.322]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:51.742 --> 01:00:53.184]  Only questions for Webster Tarpley.
[01:00:53.424 --> 01:00:54.865]  He can talk about almost any subject.
[01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:55.666]  9-11 Truth.
[01:00:56.026 --> 01:00:57.187]  Government sponsored terror.
[01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:57.768]  Eugenics.
[01:00:58.248 --> 01:01:02.971]  The economy, what's happening in the world, but don't please call in and ask me about chupacabras or anything.
[01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:03.852]  I'm going to hang up on you.
[01:01:04.112 --> 01:01:05.593]  We'd love to hear from everybody though.
[01:01:05.613 --> 01:01:05.873]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:06.214 --> 01:01:10.277]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest.
[01:01:10.737 --> 01:01:14.720]  Then I'll also go through news blitzes, get into the governor, which looks like a political hit.
[01:01:16.092 --> 01:01:18.074]  Up in South Carolina and a lot more.
[01:01:18.995 --> 01:01:23.538]  Also the video of the Chicago cop for no reason beating a bartender almost to death.
[01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:26.701]  And the judge said, no sentence.
[01:01:27.442 --> 01:01:28.262]  Keep your badge.
[01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:29.944]  You're on probation for two years.
[01:01:29.984 --> 01:01:31.025]  Good job, basically.
[01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.800]  So, pretty soon they'll be shooting us for fun.
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.463]  It'll be, hey, here's a thousand dollars.
[01:01:35.903 --> 01:01:37.225]  Be a bounty on us or something.
[01:01:37.265 --> 01:01:40.370]  I mean, just the mafianess of the government is just unbelievable.
[01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:46.660]  Going back to Webster Griffin Tarbell, you're trying to make a point there, Webster, as we slammed into that satellite-initiated break.
[01:01:48.052 --> 01:01:50.174]  Well, just look at what's going on.
[01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:51.715]  The program of the U.S.
[01:01:51.755 --> 01:02:01.485]  and the British for all these countries is partition, balkanization, getting back to a crazy quilt instead of a unified national state.
[01:02:01.525 --> 01:02:03.346]  Brzezinski writes about this all the time.
[01:02:03.406 --> 01:02:04.888]  He writes about microstates,
[01:02:05.408 --> 01:02:05.969]  We're good to go.
[01:02:24.131 --> 01:02:25.052]  Or Blackwater.
[01:02:25.452 --> 01:02:30.475]  Czechoslovakia was divided into two parts right after the fall of the Warsaw Pact.
[01:02:30.815 --> 01:02:33.077]  Yugoslavia divided into five parts.
[01:02:33.577 --> 01:02:35.298]  Iraq divided into three parts.
[01:02:35.358 --> 01:02:37.780]  Maybe two parts now and another part coming.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.661]  The plan for Iran is to divide it into six parts.
[01:02:41.042 --> 01:02:43.163]  The plan for Pakistan into five parts.
[01:02:43.223 --> 01:02:44.544]  Sudan into two parts.
[01:02:45.084 --> 01:02:46.005]  And on and on and on.
[01:02:47.185 --> 01:02:50.387]  Some people come forward and say, secessionism in the United States?
[01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:54.949]  I don't think so, because that's exactly the program of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:57.530]  Microstates in many states in the U.S.
[01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:03.893]  or North America would be... Well, Webster, I'm going to let you speak on this, but I want to be clear.
[01:03:04.813 --> 01:03:23.394]  The mainstream media and Fox News and these different governors, including the one who's in trouble now, Ann Rick Perry, hijacked a state's rights movement saying we're not going to let the offshore banks control the federal government and through that mechanism
[01:03:24.616 --> 01:03:24.796]  I think?
[01:03:40.259 --> 01:03:50.421]  And balkanization, which it wasn't, and to the right said, oh yes, it's good, we do want to secede, and now they have Glenn Beck and others pushing for physical secession.
[01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:51.101]  So I agree.
[01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:52.782]  I'm not for secession.
[01:03:53.162 --> 01:04:03.524]  I'm for the states, like they said no to the Patriot Act, saying no, we're going to keep the republic in place and reconvene the federal government if it becomes a complete vassal of offshore banks.
[01:04:03.544 --> 01:04:06.805]  But no, I agree with you, there's been an attempt, somewhat successful,
[01:04:07.785 --> 01:04:17.632]  To miscast or change the casting of this movement that I and others have been pushing into pure secession, not declaration of the republic rights.
[01:04:18.763 --> 01:04:27.449]  I have a program for California, which can be adapted to any state, and I'd be happy if I could to adapt it if people have struggles going on in different states.
[01:04:27.469 --> 01:04:28.490]  Okay, well we gotta break again.
[01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:29.491]  I interrupted you.
[01:04:29.531 --> 01:04:30.972]  When we come back, long segment.
[01:04:31.132 --> 01:04:31.452]  Okay.
[01:04:32.153 --> 01:04:39.177]  Flesh out that full point that you want to make about that, and I agree with you of what they've done to it, but it's nuanced.
[01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:40.919]  People say, I'm saying secede.
[01:04:41.579 --> 01:04:47.744]  No, I'm saying the state's right, 9th, 10th Amendment, where the feds can't come into Texas and take my guns.
[01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:52.341]  Or they can't come in and say the Feds own all the water supply of the U.S.
[01:04:52.761 --> 01:04:54.062]  and use that to triple prices.
[01:04:54.162 --> 01:04:56.745]  Because the bankers can balkanize to get control of you.
[01:04:57.626 --> 01:05:00.609]  Or they can use a strong central government to do it, as you know, Webster.
[01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:05.874]  So I'm trying to head off both the paths by balancing the powers of the states against the Fed.
[01:05:07.298 --> 01:05:08.860]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:13.627]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:05:13.727 --> 01:05:16.471]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:05:16.691 --> 01:05:19.535]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:05:19.735 --> 01:05:24.462]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:25.603]  If you simply prepare.
[01:05:25.803 --> 01:05:28.726]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:29.046 --> 01:05:35.932]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[01:07:12.784 --> 01:07:13.944]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:07:14.084 --> 01:07:18.046]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[01:07:18.346 --> 01:07:19.907]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:25.150]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:26.651]  Or best superfood of 2009.
[01:07:27.271 --> 01:07:30.193]  Inner food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.

[01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.234]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:16.894 --> 01:08:17.694]  You want answers?
[01:08:18.475 --> 01:08:19.436]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:19.456 --> 01:08:23.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.218 --> 01:08:28.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.263 --> 01:08:32.326]  All right, eight minutes into the third hour.
[01:08:32.386 --> 01:08:34.007]  Your phone call's coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.029]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:38.072]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:38.092 --> 01:08:38.372]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:38.412 --> 01:08:39.694]  Central Standard Time.
[01:08:39.794 --> 01:08:40.855]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:41.115]  Eastern.
[01:08:46.321 --> 01:08:58.078]  Over 150 plus thousand people a day downloading the free podcast at InfoWars.com, listening on their MP3, their iPhone, whatever device they have, where they want, when they want, how they want.
[01:08:58.499 --> 01:09:00.802]  Thank you so much for making us number one on Shoutcast.
[01:09:01.343 --> 01:09:07.268]  Number one on many Eminem affiliates, just writings coming in from those just exploding everywhere.
[01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:10.311]  As people find out, all these years we were telling you the truth.
[01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:11.953]  This new world order is real.
[01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:13.794]  This global empire is real.
[01:09:13.834 --> 01:09:17.518]  We have a good chance of beating it if we just wake up to it and decide we have power and say no.
[01:09:18.038 --> 01:09:19.780]  Okay, Webster, I want to get into the economy.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:27.126]  So let's accelerate through your point about the secession movements around the world, how they balkanize everywhere.
[01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.269]  Or if they can, they want a powerful central government.
[01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:31.630]  If they've got that, that's fine.
[01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:39.956]  But if they want to bring something down or shut off a region, sanctions, they fund terrorists, they fund racial break-off or religious break-off groups.
[01:09:40.817 --> 01:09:43.479]  You were beginning to warn about that here in the United States.
[01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:49.303]  The states' rights movement being hijacked and turned into a secession movement.
[01:09:49.323 --> 01:09:50.544]  Then let's move into Pakistan.
[01:09:50.564 --> 01:09:54.447]  Let's move into what you see happening in North Korea with Russia and then the economy.
[01:09:55.396 --> 01:10:04.619]  Just in terms of what states can do, I would always say that the main level where you're going to fight a world economic depression is at the level of the federal government.
[01:10:04.719 --> 01:10:10.260]  And I urge people to regard government as the battlefield where the people confront the bankers.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:19.143]  And if you don't fight the bankers concerning the government, in the government, then the bankers will control the government, and that's going to be bad.
[01:10:19.203 --> 01:10:20.463]  But if you have a mass movement,
[01:10:21.047 --> 01:10:21.367]  I think so.
[01:10:36.268 --> 01:10:41.172]  In California, you have the whole economy collapsing and the place is descending into barbarism with Schwarzenegger.
[01:10:41.592 --> 01:10:47.676]  You've also got this thing going on in New York, where the state government of New York has just about lapsed into chaos itself.
[01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:53.660]  It's a situation... They're saying they're going to have the state police come arrest the members of the legislature.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.440]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:54.661 --> 01:10:55.641]  So here's what you can do, though.
[01:10:55.661 --> 01:11:04.026]  Let's see, what can a state do, rather than assert, you know, general principles, or maybe in addition to the general principles, let's assert a substantive program.
[01:11:04.046 --> 01:11:05.346]  How are you going to fight the Depression?
[01:11:05.606 --> 01:11:06.607]  You want states' rights?
[01:11:06.647 --> 01:11:06.887]  Fine.
[01:11:06.927 --> 01:11:07.467]  To do what?
[01:11:08.048 --> 01:11:08.848]  Here's what I would do.
[01:11:09.168 --> 01:11:09.909]  Tobin tax.
[01:11:10.629 --> 01:11:11.990]  You look around in California.
[01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:13.791]  Let's take California, a good example.
[01:11:14.773 --> 01:11:15.894]  Everybody's overtaxed.
[01:11:15.954 --> 01:11:17.435]  You don't want to put any more taxes on people.
[01:11:17.455 --> 01:11:21.096]  But you want a local Tobin tax, not what the New World Order wants, right?
[01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:22.417]  No, this is state tax.
[01:11:22.437 --> 01:11:25.479]  In other words, the government of California in Sacramento can say...
[01:11:26.272 --> 01:11:37.024]  The only untapped source of wealth, the only, it's not really wealth, but let's call it a cash flow, the only cash flow that is not taxed six ways to Sunday is financial speculation.
[01:11:37.245 --> 01:11:38.867]  Interesting coincidence, huh?
[01:11:39.147 --> 01:11:46.876]  Financial speculation, the most harmful of all activities, the activity that brought us derivatives and the Depression, is completely untaxed.
[01:11:47.276 --> 01:12:00.695]  So let's have a Tobin tax, a securities transfer tax, which would be a 1% tax on all derivatives, stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, commodity speculation, the kind of speculation that drives up the price of gasoline.
[01:12:01.015 --> 01:12:04.100]  Won't the feds claim a commerce clause on that?
[01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.082]  I mean, do something, right?
[01:12:07.102 --> 01:12:09.003]  Don't be paralyzed by what they might do.
[01:12:09.463 --> 01:12:13.245]  Let Obama come out and argue in the courts that that's impossible.
[01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:20.069]  No, I think a Tobin tax, if you can have a sales tax in California, it's a 9% sales tax in many areas.
[01:12:20.109 --> 01:12:23.511]  So, if you want to go out and buy a pair of shoes for your kid, you pay 9%.
[01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:25.752]  What is the banker paid?
[01:12:26.033 --> 01:12:32.078]  There's a big financial district there in San Francisco with, you know, Wells Fargo and Transamerica and all these people.
[01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:37.123]  That huge stylized pyramid with the Eye of Horus on top that people may have seen.
[01:12:37.873 --> 01:12:38.654]  They pay nothing.
[01:12:38.894 --> 01:12:39.795]  There's no tax.
[01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.136]  There's no sales tax on banknotes.
[01:12:41.196 --> 01:12:41.757]  Exactly.
[01:12:41.817 --> 01:12:46.541]  They tax us through the bureaucracy and all the money's fed into their mouth.
[01:12:46.881 --> 01:12:49.083]  Yeah, so I'm saying, let's redress the balance.
[01:12:49.123 --> 01:12:54.788]  And if you say, is there anything to tax that's not already overtaxed, it's clearly speculation.
[01:12:55.088 --> 01:12:57.350]  So derivatives and speculation of all kinds.
[01:12:57.911 --> 01:13:03.596]  1% tax paid by the broker, paid by the institutional partner in the exchange, not by you.
[01:13:04.116 --> 01:13:05.939]  So that, I think, that would do it for California.
[01:13:05.979 --> 01:13:06.600]  How about another one?
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.902]  Stop foreclosures.
[01:13:08.282 --> 01:13:10.125]  We've already, we've been on this program.
[01:13:10.165 --> 01:13:11.187]  Oh, I gotta stop you.
[01:13:11.727 --> 01:13:14.331]  I wanted to get into Malthusian economics.
[01:13:14.832 --> 01:13:16.274]  He wanted to bulldoze cities.
[01:13:16.675 --> 01:13:17.756]  He wanted to do things like that.
[01:13:17.776 --> 01:13:19.299]  For those that don't know, I know you know Webster.
[01:13:19.819 --> 01:13:22.522]  Obama saying bulldoze one-fourth of U.S.
[01:13:22.562 --> 01:13:22.923]  cities.
[01:13:23.283 --> 01:13:26.787]  This was the Brzezinski pole pot model for those that don't know.
[01:13:26.827 --> 01:13:32.033]  And they just put it in USA Today like, well, of course we've got to bulldoze the cities.
[01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:39.601]  I mean, this is, instead of just letting people live in those, they're making them go to sports stadiums in California and Hawaii.
[01:13:40.322 --> 01:13:41.483]  We sent cameras out there.
[01:13:41.563 --> 01:13:44.705]  As we predicted, you're not allowed to stay on the streets now or at a park.
[01:13:44.965 --> 01:13:46.406]  You've got to go to a FEMA camp.
[01:13:46.466 --> 01:13:51.850]  Meanwhile, the feds are federalizing the cities and are going to bulldoze neighborhoods.
[01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:54.472]  Which is a code word for land grabbing.
[01:13:54.692 --> 01:13:56.853]  Imagine the bulldozing Flint, Michigan.
[01:13:56.893 --> 01:13:58.434]  This is just national suicide.
[01:13:58.814 --> 01:14:01.276]  A healthy economy builds new cities.
[01:14:01.356 --> 01:14:02.757]  You don't bulldoze old ones.
[01:14:03.077 --> 01:14:04.718]  You develop absolutely new ones.
[01:14:04.738 --> 01:14:06.820]  Like the science cities, indeed.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.102]  Places that are built around a specific new industry that's emerging.
[01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:15.383]  But, you know, as you're saying, in California, this is the capital of the Obamaville, right?
[01:14:15.423 --> 01:14:17.784]  The Hoovervilles of the current depression.
[01:14:18.364 --> 01:14:19.584]  You want to do something about that?
[01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:19.924]  All right.
[01:14:20.084 --> 01:14:24.625]  State law, ban foreclosures for five years or the duration of the crisis.
[01:14:25.565 --> 01:14:28.186]  And that also applies to family farms.
[01:14:28.546 --> 01:14:30.086]  That applies to any business.
[01:14:30.546 --> 01:14:31.286]  A restaurant.
[01:14:31.626 --> 01:14:32.406]  A dry cleaner.
[01:14:32.606 --> 01:14:33.867]  You can't be foreclosed on.
[01:14:33.907 --> 01:14:39.848]  You can't be driven out of business for reasons of financial debt for five years or the duration of the crisis.
[01:14:40.528 --> 01:14:48.935]  Because we look at the Austrian view, which I've heard you this weekend attacking, and we look at your egalitarian view, and so we let people decide and think about themselves.
[01:14:49.275 --> 01:15:04.928]  But regardless, both of those systems are decidedly better than giving $14.8 trillion, as Bloomberg reported, in seven months to offshore banks, who then hoard the money and increase the price of loans and have accelerated foreclosures.
[01:15:04.948 --> 01:15:08.110]  So they promised, Bloomberg and AP reported,
[01:15:09.651 --> 01:15:22.637]  $9.4 trillion would have paid off all mortgages, not just mortgages and trouble, $45 million apartments, penthouses, $200,000 houses, $100,000 condos, everything paid off.
[01:15:23.577 --> 01:15:25.078]  That's our tax money to begin with.
[01:15:25.098 --> 01:15:27.739]  All real estate paid off.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.441]  That's a dwelling.
[01:15:32.902 --> 01:15:34.662]  But no, now it's worse.
[01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:35.603]  No loaning.
[01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:37.564]  Actual interest rates going up.
[01:15:38.644 --> 01:15:45.527]  And then the phony right-wing will say, you're a communist, Webster, for saying, just freeze the mortgages to these criminal banks.
[01:15:45.767 --> 01:15:49.829]  They've already been given more money than... I mean, it's such a scam.
[01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:56.611]  But then meanwhile, the so-called conservatives want to give trillions more to the bankers and then have them not say where it went.
[01:15:56.671 --> 01:15:57.772]  That's the new conservatism.
[01:15:58.132 --> 01:16:01.095]  My method basically says, people stay in their homes.
[01:16:01.135 --> 01:16:04.217]  You throw an American family on the street, it's a federal crime.
[01:16:04.237 --> 01:16:06.419]  Wall Street can eat the losses.
[01:16:06.899 --> 01:16:09.682]  And as you say, this is not the main thing in the financial crisis.
[01:16:09.922 --> 01:16:15.827]  The goal of all these bailouts has very little to do with subprime housing or housing in any sense.
[01:16:15.927 --> 01:16:18.969]  The centerpiece is derivatives, derivatives, derivatives.
[01:16:18.989 --> 01:16:19.850]  1.5 quadrillion
[01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:29.616]  Of derivatives, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities.
[01:16:29.676 --> 01:16:34.539]  And the mortgage-backed securities is where the subprime business comes in.
[01:16:34.839 --> 01:16:45.065]  But the goal of the Obama administration, the overriding purpose of Obama, is to try to bail out the derivatives bubble, $1.5 quadrillion, and it can't be done.
[01:16:45.205 --> 01:16:48.688]  And the only thing you can do is realize you're dealing with a black hole.
[01:16:48.788 --> 01:16:50.769]  It doesn't matter how much you shovel in there.
[01:16:51.209 --> 01:16:59.031]  You've got to have some kind of a disintegration ray that you fire at the black hole and get rid of it.
[01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:10.974]  But that's what I was going to say, Webster, is that you said five months ago, when I interviewed you for the Obama deception, that the more money we pump into the bailout, the worse it gets.
[01:17:11.034 --> 01:17:12.274]  And that's actually happened.
[01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:20.516]  Loans are down, prices are up, foreclosures are accelerating, and the bankers are saying, put more in the black hole, that will fix it.
[01:17:21.167 --> 01:17:22.148]  And, of course, it won't.
[01:17:22.188 --> 01:17:25.090]  So the answer, of course, is to shut down these banks.
[01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:32.075]  In other words, 16 out of the top 19 banks are insolvent and should be seized this Friday by Sheila Bair.
[01:17:32.456 --> 01:17:43.924]  And the fact that Sheila Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has not seized Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York, Mellon, and so on down the list.
[01:17:44.005 --> 01:17:46.947]  It's the top 16 out of 19, as far as I can see.
[01:17:47.507 --> 01:17:48.268]  That is a crime!
[01:17:48.468 --> 01:17:52.530]  Sheila Bair is violating the law, and this is simply illegal.
[01:17:52.910 --> 01:18:01.395]  She does shut down these little banks, tiny little banks in out-of-the-way places, rural America, out-of-the-way small banks.
[01:18:01.895 --> 01:18:11.241]  The difference, though, Alex, is the Austrian school will, they may oppose what Obama does, but they still leave you with the Depression.
[01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:12.922]  The American system
[01:18:13.662 --> 01:18:20.289]  Of Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln, Kerry, Roosevelt, Kennedy, which I'm trying to represent.
[01:18:20.569 --> 01:18:24.733]  The American system actually deals with the Depression and defeats the Depression.
[01:18:24.793 --> 01:18:27.656]  So one side can say, let's defeat Obama, that's fine.
[01:18:28.017 --> 01:18:29.698]  But let's go beyond defeating Obama.
[01:18:29.718 --> 01:18:33.162]  We've also got a real economic depression that we've got to deal with.
[01:18:33.202 --> 01:18:36.425]  So California could have a Tobin tax, they could stop foreclosures.
[01:18:36.465 --> 01:18:37.026]  The other thing,
[01:18:37.606 --> 01:18:40.148]  How about reviving a state-usuary law?
[01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:48.295]  Many states, just about all of them, up until the Volcker era, had a limit on the amount of interest that you could charge within the state.
[01:18:48.315 --> 01:18:49.716]  This is clearly constitutional.
[01:18:50.597 --> 01:18:52.298]  And this was in place for many years.
[01:18:52.698 --> 01:18:58.403]  When Volcker began getting up to that 22% prime rate, which meant, you know, for the average person, 30, 35, or more percent,
[01:19:01.265 --> 01:19:03.086]  These laws were swept away.
[01:19:03.486 --> 01:19:12.050]  What I was going to ask you is, how did Obama's reform mean that you had a 15% rate on your credit card and it went to 25?
[01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:15.111]  How is that a reform?
[01:19:15.131 --> 01:19:19.033]  Again, it's the corporate state.
[01:19:19.073 --> 01:19:24.515]  The only term for it is the Mussolini fascist corporate state.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:37.698]  Where corporation, it doesn't really refer to a modern corporation, it refers to a medieval guild, where you've got government, business, and labor together, obeying the logic of the banks, above all.
[01:19:37.858 --> 01:19:40.461]  Not the logic of government or the people, but of the banks.
[01:19:41.682 --> 01:19:51.545]  Yeah, the whole universe is a food chain feeding into them at the top, and they've got to destroy things to feed, so they're not builders, they're destroyers, they're parasites.
[01:19:52.305 --> 01:19:55.686]  Webster, see, we kind of sidetracked into the economy first.
[01:19:57.227 --> 01:20:01.848]  I want to go through the geopolitical structure, then calls, then the economy.
[01:20:02.388 --> 01:20:05.209]  Okay, we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarpley on North Korea.
[01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:13.552]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:20:13.592 --> 01:20:14.112]  and the world.
[01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:17.834]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:20:18.254 --> 01:20:24.477]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:20:24.757 --> 01:20:26.537]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:20:26.777 --> 01:20:33.080]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:33.500]  I think so.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.801]  I think so.
[01:21:07.643 --> 01:21:12.948]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:19.013]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:19.553 --> 01:21:25.719]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:26.059 --> 01:21:27.880]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.402]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:30.482 --> 01:21:41.430]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:44.952]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:45.352 --> 01:21:46.733]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:53.418]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:24:22.196 --> 01:24:24.078]  I don't want to start taking your calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:24.098 --> 01:24:27.221]  Webster, let's move quickly through what's happening in the rest of the world.
[01:24:28.242 --> 01:24:37.670]  Obviously, the globalists, the neocons, the neoliberals, the New World Order, the Anglo-American establishment, the global empire, they want crises worldwide.
[01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:45.417]  What do you see happening with North Korea right now, and what do you see unfolding with that in the future?
[01:24:46.141 --> 01:24:49.464]  Well, North Korea has traditionally been used by the U.S.
[01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:58.132]  under Bush, let's say, to maintain imperial discipline in Northeast Asia, especially when the U.S.
[01:24:58.172 --> 01:25:01.635]  was getting ready to attack Iraq under Bush.
[01:25:01.715 --> 01:25:05.279]  You might have thought that when the cat's away, the mice will play.
[01:25:05.719 --> 01:25:11.665]  That might have given Japan and South Korea the chance to do something independent on their own.
[01:25:12.186 --> 01:25:18.708]  So, in order to make sure that didn't happen, and this is actually an exercise in buck passing, as the theoreticians call this.
[01:25:19.435 --> 01:25:28.421]  If you get a crisis going with North Korea, you terrify Japan, terrify South Korea, you force them back to the skirts of the U.S.
[01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:33.864]  nuclear umbrella, to mix a metaphor, and you maintain control by having an artificial crisis.
[01:25:33.884 --> 01:25:38.307]  So, Kim Jong-il, the dear leader, has been a great asset for the U.S.
[01:25:38.387 --> 01:25:43.170]  in maintaining the imperial status quo in Northeast Asia.
[01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.873]  Also, you know, scaring China, embarrassing China, creating all kinds of
[01:25:47.463 --> 01:25:47.804]  I think.
[01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:09.730]  You've got this, you know, every year they have this Ulchi focus lens exercise and so forth.
[01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:11.091]  Yeah, that happened a month ago.
[01:26:11.191 --> 01:26:25.740]  Former presidents being thrown off cliffs, all submarines and ships, planes flying over North Korean airspace, right while the dear leader is giving power to the next hereditary thug, who's 20-something years old.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:27.721]  Perfect time to try to razz them.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:35.842]  I think they've probably had some border violations and territorial water violations, at least the way they see it.
[01:26:37.042 --> 01:26:38.202]  They are paranoid, of course.
[01:26:38.222 --> 01:26:43.183]  These people are the true heirs of Stalin, I guess, in the modern era.
[01:26:43.203 --> 01:26:44.484]  So it's a paranoid regime.
[01:26:44.964 --> 01:26:50.085]  And it seems to me also that they must have been getting threats that the world public doesn't see.
[01:26:50.145 --> 01:26:54.626]  In other words, some kind of a back-channel, informal envoy
[01:26:55.453 --> 01:26:58.516]  Traveler, who knows what, speaking for the U.S.
[01:26:58.576 --> 01:26:59.057]  government.
[01:26:59.377 --> 01:27:03.281]  Well now they're saying you ship even artillery shells to any country.
[01:27:03.881 --> 01:27:05.223]  Every other nation can sell weapons.
[01:27:05.523 --> 01:27:10.147]  We're going to board your ships and take them, which is a Cuban Missile Crisis level provocation.
[01:27:10.187 --> 01:27:12.630]  So that's out in the open throwing the gauntlet down.
[01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:21.039]  Right, and I think on this they're right, that if you aboard one of their ships on the high seas, that's an act of piracy and war, and that is casu spella.
[01:27:21.059 --> 01:27:25.183]  In other words, if you want to take it that way, that can be the reason to get going with a war.
[01:27:25.264 --> 01:27:32.812]  I don't know if it's going to come to that, but look, go back to Joe Biden's famous speech in Seattle, 19th of October last year, where he said,
[01:27:33.744 --> 01:27:38.850]  After one year, we'll be hated because of our economic policies, and we're going to need your support then.
[01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:40.311]  That was the long perspective.
[01:27:40.752 --> 01:27:48.841]  The short perspective was, in the first six months, Obama will be tested with a manufactured international crisis.
[01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:55.749]  Uh, so six months takes us up to the 20th of July, so we've got a little bit less than a month for this to happen.
[01:27:55.809 --> 01:28:06.081]  And the hype now, of course, as everybody can see, is that there's going to be some kind of a missile test from North Korea on or around July 4th, that this is a great affront to the U.S.
[01:28:07.262 --> 01:28:16.085]  The Patriot missile battalions, I guess, sent to Hawaii demands for more ABM interceptors in Alaska and so forth.
[01:28:16.126 --> 01:28:21.488]  But in reality, North Korea has put out their international alert, as all governments do in the U.S.
[01:28:21.528 --> 01:28:32.732]  and Russia test missiles, saying, we're firing a missile into this area, in and around this date, nowhere near Hawaii it's come out, and it's on the death date of the first thug,
[01:28:33.092 --> 01:28:41.194]  They always test missiles, it turns out, on the death date, the day he died, so this is more just manufactured crises.
[01:28:41.474 --> 01:28:46.415]  Right, and of course, it is their right to test missiles within certain parameters, right?
[01:28:46.475 --> 01:28:48.275]  Everybody else does it, right?
[01:28:48.315 --> 01:28:55.057]  Pakistan, India, Iran, everybody in the world has missiles, starting with the U.S., the Russians, the British, and the French.
[01:28:56.957 --> 01:29:14.947]  It's a manufactured crisis, and I think the goal is always to maintain the subjugation and subjection of Japan, especially South Korea, and also to embarrass China, just to create tremendous problems for China, because the worst things are in North Korea.
[01:29:14.987 --> 01:29:21.270]  The more refugees go across into China, the bigger the problem is for this very important Chinese province of Manchuria.
[01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:21.870]  I don't know.
[01:29:35.894 --> 01:29:43.097]  And isn't it also for our consumption here domestically as well, not just to keep the entire area of Asia in fear?
[01:29:43.117 --> 01:29:44.118]  Yes, I think.
[01:29:44.198 --> 01:29:53.022]  And remember, with Obama, the door to false flag is now wide open, because the ruling elite thinks that he can accuse a country and be believed, which he could not be.
[01:29:53.362 --> 01:29:53.702]  Exactly.
[01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:57.264]  Let's cover false flag when we get back, and then take your phone calls, then get into the economy.
[01:29:57.764 --> 01:29:58.664]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:00.765]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.686 --> 01:30:04.387]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.298 --> 01:30:12.300]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:16.302]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:16.522 --> 01:30:22.125]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:22.425 --> 01:30:27.288]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:27.988]  Number three,
[01:30:28.408 --> 01:30:33.831]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:30:34.712 --> 01:30:37.354]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:30:37.614 --> 01:30:41.016]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:42.117 --> 01:30:45.719]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:45.959 --> 01:30:51.461]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:30:51.701 --> 01:30:56.262]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:56.403 --> 01:30:57.943]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:06.846 --> 01:31:07.947]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:31:08.227 --> 01:31:10.007]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:31:10.227 --> 01:31:10.868]  Well, you should.
[01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:15.450]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:16.170]  That's right.
[01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:24.954]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.

[01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.655]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:31:27.875 --> 01:31:33.499]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:40.384]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:45.949]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:07.701]  Hello, friends.
[01:32:07.761 --> 01:32:08.661]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:11.743]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[01:32:11.783 --> 01:32:13.443]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[01:32:13.563 --> 01:32:14.724]  We need to be independent.
[01:32:14.744 --> 01:32:16.325]  And food and water is the key.
[01:32:16.525 --> 01:32:19.386]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:32:19.566 --> 01:32:24.268]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:32:24.508 --> 01:32:25.448]  If you simply prepare.
[01:32:25.628 --> 01:32:28.570]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:35.773]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:32:35.873 --> 01:32:38.994]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:32:56.309 --> 01:32:58.130]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:26.677]  Warren, Johan, Anthony, Annie, many others.
[01:33:27.338 --> 01:33:34.484]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:34.504 --> 01:33:35.405]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:35.785 --> 01:33:38.408]  I really appreciate Webster Carver spending so much time with us today.
[01:33:38.428 --> 01:33:41.230]  We've got him still a half hour into the next.
[01:33:42.071 --> 01:33:52.823]  Thirty last minutes of the show, I'm going to do a big news blitz and play some important video clips and give you my take on why they're getting rid of the South Carolina governor, or at least destroying his political fortunes.
[01:33:53.363 --> 01:33:55.706]  So that is coming up as well.
[01:33:56.892 --> 01:34:01.634]  But I do want to get into false flag terror and then the economy with Webster Tarbley in one moment.
[01:34:02.354 --> 01:34:12.317]  Before we do that I have a few sponsors I want to thank who I believe in and I think are really great folks and they also make this radio show possible.
[01:34:14.038 --> 01:34:16.138]  And one of those sponsors is Front Sight.
[01:34:16.919 --> 01:34:23.781]  This is the premier and the biggest in the country shooting
[01:34:25.515 --> 01:34:30.223]  Training Center for handguns, rifles, shotguns, long distance, you name it.
[01:34:32.286 --> 01:34:34.430]  And if you want to learn how to shoot good at 600 yards, 1,000 yards...
[01:34:36.785 --> 01:34:38.226]  I said 6,000 yards the other day, folks.
[01:34:38.266 --> 01:34:39.127]  I get numbers backwards.
[01:34:40.268 --> 01:34:41.289]  You want to go to FrontSight.
[01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:42.910]  It's FrontSight.com.
[01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:44.191]  Just the front of a gun site.
[01:34:44.551 --> 01:34:45.232]  FrontSight.
[01:34:45.792 --> 01:34:48.774]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[01:34:49.295 --> 01:34:51.677]  And look, I know a lot of people went through their firearms training.
[01:34:52.037 --> 01:35:05.067]  They have their big jumbo course with the 30-state concealed weapons permit, with the free $500 to $600 Springfield handgun, your caliber you choose, the five days of training, everything.
[01:35:06.544 --> 01:35:07.565]  For $1,100.
[01:35:09.326 --> 01:35:10.387]  What is it?
[01:35:10.607 --> 01:35:10.387]  $1,195.
[01:35:11.388 --> 01:35:12.209]  That would normally be about $4,000.
[01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:15.892]  But they've got a bunch of other free training online.
[01:35:16.693 --> 01:35:17.573]  A lot of great news.
[01:35:17.633 --> 01:35:18.814]  A free newsletter online.
[01:35:18.854 --> 01:35:20.936]  Just go check out FrontSite.com.
[01:35:21.316 --> 01:35:23.899]  FrontSite.com.
[01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:28.322]  And they've also got their phone number on there.
[01:35:28.362 --> 01:35:29.683]  You know, I should get their phone number out.
[01:35:29.703 --> 01:35:32.826]  We had Dr. Ignatius Piazza on a few days ago.
[01:35:32.886 --> 01:35:33.787]  He gave that out.
[01:35:33.807 --> 01:35:34.868]  He said they've got a lot of phone calls.
[01:35:36.343 --> 01:35:38.206]  But it's on the website, FrontSite.com.
[01:35:38.226 --> 01:35:42.052]  Next time I plug it, I'll be sure to have the number for you, too, as well.
[01:35:43.234 --> 01:35:46.119]  And lastly, sponsor-wise, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:35:46.179 --> 01:35:46.920]  Great little unit.
[01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:54.980]  It provides 1,800 watts of power, 1,800 watt power generator, a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:35:55.601 --> 01:36:01.187]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today, and this will power quite a few little things in your house.
[01:36:01.207 --> 01:36:04.471]  You can get multiple units and run more in your house or enough units in the whole house.
[01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:08.455]  Great little proven solar panel itself, the little unit.
[01:36:09.076 --> 01:36:10.378]  And the plugs that go into it.
[01:36:10.398 --> 01:36:11.559]  It's just a great system.
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.383]  All part of being prepared, getting more and more off the grid.
[01:36:14.723 --> 01:36:20.069]  MySolarBackup.com or call toll free to get a brochure or order it or to inquire 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 MySolarBackup.com
[01:36:27.273 --> 01:36:29.475]  And last but not least, let me digress now.
[01:36:29.515 --> 01:36:39.502]  Before we get into false flag terror, I wanted to briefly get Webster Griffin Tarbley's take on a few news items, and then we'll do false flag terror, then calls, and then the economy before he leaves us.
[01:36:40.022 --> 01:36:47.248]  But I wanted to bring this up because Webster really is a historian, and a economist, and author, and journalist.
[01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:48.229]  I mean, he really is a great guy.
[01:36:48.549 --> 01:36:52.572]  And the more I research this stuff, the more I realize over the years how much Webster really does know.
[01:36:55.131 --> 01:36:56.571]  This is a crass plug.
[01:36:57.312 --> 01:37:04.113]  We carry both of his great books, the one about Barack Obama and his crime machine, and then the unauthorized biography of Obama.
[01:37:04.353 --> 01:37:06.934]  You really want the straight poop, as they say.
[01:37:06.974 --> 01:37:09.334]  This isn't rumor, innuendo, baloney.
[01:37:09.594 --> 01:37:10.435]  This is scholarly.
[01:37:10.775 --> 01:37:12.335]  All available at Infowars.com.
[01:37:12.355 --> 01:37:14.196]  But I'll put you on the spot, Webster.
[01:37:14.496 --> 01:37:18.097]  You're obviously in the Obama deception, the main narrative voice in there other than myself.
[01:37:22.432 --> 01:37:22.873]  Endgame.
[01:37:22.933 --> 01:37:25.655]  I remember I gave a speech in Chicago, first time I physically met you.
[01:37:25.675 --> 01:37:27.157]  I've been interviewing you for more than 10 years.
[01:37:28.117 --> 01:37:35.144]  And I remember you going, yes, excellent information, and learning you had a great knowledge of the eugenics model, the idea of these people.
[01:37:35.584 --> 01:37:42.331]  The establishment is all moving at once right now, as if they know their window of opportunity is closing.
[01:37:43.442 --> 01:37:44.723]  And they're moving with eugenics.
[01:37:44.743 --> 01:37:46.904]  They're moving with one-child policies worldwide.
[01:37:47.004 --> 01:37:50.446]  You know, getting rid of tax credits for kids and even trying to tax having children.
[01:37:51.286 --> 01:38:00.491]  They are launching programs of climate cops training children to tattle on their parents in the United States, in Australia, in Canada.
[01:38:00.951 --> 01:38:01.851]  It's in the news today.
[01:38:01.892 --> 01:38:05.333]  Climate cops to fine wasteful homeowners and businesses.
[01:38:05.773 --> 01:38:08.155]  Austin's already setting this up as home audits.
[01:38:08.595 --> 01:38:10.076]  Has nothing to do with energy.
[01:38:10.616 --> 01:38:12.177]  Literally this commissariat
[01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:20.395]  I guess would be the best way to describe it, but it's not communist, it's like a fascistic commissariat or political officer.
[01:38:20.735 --> 01:38:26.638]  And they have the Green Police, in fact here's a shot of that for folks on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:27.359 --> 01:38:35.924]  Green Police, and that as people lose their jobs it won't be an FDR, build dams, build roads, build rest stops, build power plants.
[01:38:38.773 --> 01:38:43.217]  It will be literally tattling on neighbors, spying on people, watching surveillance camera banks.
[01:38:43.657 --> 01:38:45.839]  That's all in the news now.
[01:38:46.859 --> 01:38:49.301]  And the carbon tax, Al Gore.
[01:38:50.162 --> 01:38:51.483]  Can you spend a few minutes on that?
[01:38:51.503 --> 01:38:53.905]  Then we'll go to calls and then get into false flag and the economy.
[01:38:55.946 --> 01:38:58.329]  The Federal Reserve Banker Reform Bill?
[01:38:58.349 --> 01:39:02.374]  Is it the Federal Reserve can seize anything connected to any part of the economy?
[01:39:02.634 --> 01:39:05.697]  Just the complete end of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:39:05.938 --> 01:39:07.119]  We thought Bush was bad.
[01:39:07.179 --> 01:39:10.243]  It's just a progression, an evolution from bad to worse.
[01:39:10.723 --> 01:39:25.654]  Where the feds are announcing they're taking over the entire water supply, no more states' rights, they're announcing green taxes, they're announcing total takeovers, banking takeovers, Homeland Security reports saying all gun owners and veterans are terrorists.
[01:39:27.215 --> 01:39:32.138]  I mean, it's so over the top, I'm having trouble processing it all.
[01:39:32.378 --> 01:39:45.086]  Are they trying to just bomb Russia's like a human wave attack of tyranny, where we may shoot down five or six of the things, but three or four will make it, and any one of these is like a hydrogen bomb being brought into Liberty's bosom?
[01:39:46.486 --> 01:39:55.892]  I would certainly say that one of the main goals of Obama from the very beginning is to undermine the rationality and the political will
[01:39:56.838 --> 01:39:57.899]  Of the American people.
[01:39:57.959 --> 01:40:00.702]  In other words, we have this very interesting thing.
[01:40:01.182 --> 01:40:08.029]  A woman who worked for Obama by the name of Sarah, last October, came out with her confession.
[01:40:08.129 --> 01:40:09.190]  And it was late October.
[01:40:09.771 --> 01:40:16.157]  And she said that the conscious goal inside the Obama campaign is to make you feel like your world is collapsing around you.
[01:40:16.949 --> 01:40:31.000]  That there's no hope, and that all the forces that you look to to oppose the things that Obama stands for, that these forces were all simply collapsing, that they were all going over to Obama, giving up, and so forth.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:42.089]  And in the books that you've mentioned, I compare this to certain passages of Mein Kampf by Hitler, where he says, the main purpose of my rallies
[01:40:42.779 --> 01:40:45.883]  Is to undermine the free will of people.
[01:40:46.144 --> 01:40:52.132]  In other words, to subject them to another will and force them to do what the dictator wants.
[01:40:52.252 --> 01:40:56.358]  To switch on the reptilian brain, the primitive brain, to put you into...
[01:40:57.528 --> 01:41:01.370]  I don't know about reptilian, but it's an appeal to irrationality, right?
[01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:05.051]  It's certainly an appeal... I don't mean that as reptilian in a David Icke-ian way.
[01:41:05.111 --> 01:41:07.332]  I mean the primitive areas of the brain.
[01:41:07.792 --> 01:41:11.074]  Yeah, well, irrationality, which I think is culturally there.
[01:41:11.094 --> 01:41:13.895]  I don't know about the physiological basis of...
[01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:19.521]  You're a smart guy, Webster.
[01:41:19.561 --> 01:41:23.885]  You know about the area of the brain that has aggression and sexual drive and all that?
[01:41:24.126 --> 01:41:27.029]  That's called, medically, the reptilian complex.
[01:41:27.679 --> 01:41:38.868]  Yeah, I wouldn't want to get into the idea of trying to explain human consciousness based on materialist or physiological basis, because it seems to me that most of this is culturally and psychologically.
[01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.709]  No, I agree.
[01:41:39.729 --> 01:41:41.150]  It's more complex than that, but go ahead.
[01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:44.513]  Whatever it is, Obama is appealing to the dark side.
[01:41:44.753 --> 01:41:45.454]  That's for sure.
[01:41:45.874 --> 01:41:52.920]  So Obama is an appeal to irrationality with the goal of making people the captives and the thralls
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.242]  Of irrational drives, and therefore depriving them of their reason.
[01:41:57.262 --> 01:41:59.604]  Because human reason is the point of all this, right?
[01:41:59.624 --> 01:42:07.348]  That's what we want to... We want to have a world where human reason plays the larger role, at least.
[01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:14.212]  And instead, what they want is to have irrationality, unreason, and insanity rule the roost.
[01:42:14.272 --> 01:42:16.914]  And I would call them totalitarian liberals.
[01:42:17.054 --> 01:42:19.976]  Totalitarian liberal is a term that was coined
[01:42:20.576 --> 01:42:29.418]  For John Maynard Keynes, Lord Keynes, during the 1930s, and this was the way the British ran their show during the 1930s and into World War II.
[01:42:29.678 --> 01:42:34.799]  Totalitarian liberalism, meaning that they controlled every aspect, right, the stuff that you're going through.
[01:42:34.819 --> 01:42:38.440]  At the same time, it's the bankers who rule.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:45.442]  In other words, the whole society is revamped according to what these bankrupt zombie bankers then and now... Well, let me stop you again.
[01:42:45.862 --> 01:42:47.402]  Can you comment on the Malthusian view?
[01:42:48.706 --> 01:42:57.550]  She goes to China, Nancy Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi goes to China and says, everything you buy, sell and do, everything you own, it's all going to be chronicled by the state.
[01:42:58.130 --> 01:42:59.511]  I mean, they mean business.
[01:42:59.551 --> 01:43:00.731]  This is neo-feudalism.
[01:43:00.771 --> 01:43:10.616]  This is a system of serfdom, economic degradation, as a weaponized tool to keep you at a subsistence, subservience level.
[01:43:11.513 --> 01:43:14.556]  Certainly, that's where I was headed, was the totalitarian liberalism.
[01:43:14.636 --> 01:43:20.182]  Once you say Keynes, then you have to point out that the father of Keynes is Malthus.
[01:43:20.323 --> 01:43:25.528]  In other words, Keynes is somebody who comes on the scene saying, I am an economist in the tradition of Malthus.
[01:43:25.588 --> 01:43:26.670]  And once you've said Malthus,
[01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:32.598]  You've also said Darwin, and by that I mean the ugly side of Darwin, which is the main side.
[01:43:33.119 --> 01:43:43.614]  But Darwin, when you think about social Darwinism, right, the survival of the fittest and the struggle for survival in society, that has always been the most brutal reactionaries.
[01:43:44.014 --> 01:43:44.894]  Who come forward with that.
[01:43:44.934 --> 01:43:49.436]  You could even make an argument that Hitler and Mussolini are unthinkable without Darwin.
[01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:58.239]  So today, because of the factional situation inside the U.S., you have left liberals coming forward saying, Darwin is our man.
[01:43:58.859 --> 01:44:00.140]  Darwin is a charlatan.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:05.141]  Darwin, especially what I'm referring to, is the blind watchmaker side of Darwin.
[01:44:06.082 --> 01:44:09.563]  The insistence that everything in the universe is purely by chance.
[01:44:10.123 --> 01:44:10.824]  I don't think it is.
[01:44:10.964 --> 01:44:13.426]  And that's a way to neutralize our political will.
[01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:15.248]  They always say, oh, it's just neurons.
[01:44:15.509 --> 01:44:16.690]  There are no morals.
[01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:23.316]  But then the establishment has its own dark, bloody, culling morals of the destruction economy.
[01:44:23.637 --> 01:44:27.280]  Bulldoze cities instead of build starships to Alpha Centauri.
[01:44:27.821 --> 01:44:28.261]  Exactly.
[01:44:28.361 --> 01:44:32.265]  And I think that is the ultimate appeal to irrationality.
[01:44:32.285 --> 01:44:33.867]  It's a total predestination.
[01:44:34.551 --> 01:44:37.053]  In other words, everything you do is fated and predetermined?
[01:44:37.093 --> 01:44:38.094]  Well, that's irrationality.
[01:44:38.114 --> 01:44:47.561]  Well, it's a control freak religion to overturn the entire system and just hoggedly kill everybody because that means you win as you sit on a pile of skulls.
[01:44:48.433 --> 01:44:49.874]  And that would be Al Gore, I guess.
[01:44:50.034 --> 01:44:55.657]  Al Gore and these theoreticians of global warming, which is a hoax, a fraud, and it's transparent.
[01:44:55.737 --> 01:44:59.319]  Again, as a historian, I don't need climatologists.
[01:44:59.419 --> 01:45:01.901]  They're charlatans when it comes to this stuff.
[01:45:02.441 --> 01:45:07.464]  The current variations of temperature are well within the observed historical range.
[01:45:07.884 --> 01:45:10.585]  If we go from the medieval warm period, about 1100, when you had
[01:45:12.054 --> 01:45:18.258]  You know, various kinds of grapes and vines growing in Newfoundland, and even in Iceland and Norway.
[01:45:18.659 --> 01:45:21.241]  You have wine culture going on in the North Atlantic.
[01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:23.802]  That's a whole lot warmer than what we have now.
[01:45:24.323 --> 01:45:33.229]  And then you've got this little ice age around 1600, 1650, maybe up to 1700, when the northern European ports were blocked with ice.
[01:45:33.289 --> 01:45:35.231]  Huge icebergs came floating down.
[01:45:35.251 --> 01:45:39.754]  Yeah, but let's go back 9,000 years to the beginning of the Bronze Age, when it was even hotter!
[01:45:40.501 --> 01:45:54.920]  Precisely, so I think we're well within the historically observed range, and you can even, you know, you can go into the CO2, but the German chemist of the 19th century had records about that too, and we're well within those parameters as well.
[01:45:55.521 --> 01:46:00.642]  What they're expressing is the class consciousness of the Anglo-American banking elite.
[01:46:01.042 --> 01:46:03.043]  Very interesting observation.
[01:46:03.523 --> 01:46:08.564]  Any prediction of the end of the world has a definite class content.
[01:46:08.984 --> 01:46:14.786]  In other words, if somebody's saying the world is going to end in such and such a way, you look at that, that reflects interests.
[01:46:15.206 --> 01:46:20.750]  It reflects interests of groups, of classes of people, like oligarchs, bankers, and so forth.
[01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:21.491]  And that's Gore.
[01:46:21.991 --> 01:46:25.774]  Gore is obviously, his ego ideal is Prince Charles.
[01:46:25.834 --> 01:46:28.396]  He's very much under the influence of Prince Philip.
[01:46:28.436 --> 01:46:31.058]  He thinks that he's an American aristocrat.
[01:46:31.098 --> 01:46:35.701]  He'd like to join the titled nobility and feudal oligarchy of Europe.
[01:46:36.282 --> 01:46:39.804]  And their basic idea has always been that the world is overpopulated.
[01:46:39.884 --> 01:46:40.365]  Nothing new.
[01:46:40.925 --> 01:46:54.907]  The argument that they had for the Trojan War, 1000 B.C., the principal oligarchical centers, like, you know, the cult of Apollo at Delphi, were saying, the reason we have to have the Trojan War is that the world is overpopulated.
[01:46:55.247 --> 01:46:58.988]  There are too many people pressing down on the breast of Mother Earth.
[01:46:59.068 --> 01:47:00.408]  So, nothing is new.
[01:47:00.788 --> 01:47:09.650]  The oligarchs thought that the world was overpopulated in the year 1000 B.C., and now, 3000 years later, they're coming with the same idiotic nonsense.
[01:47:10.831 --> 01:47:15.376]  But it's not idiotic if they're going to control resources as a tool of tyranny.
[01:47:15.556 --> 01:47:16.737]  They don't believe this stuff.
[01:47:17.158 --> 01:47:19.380]  They cynically know it's a way to control people.
[01:47:19.681 --> 01:47:23.285]  That's why they'll go ahead and do all the other dangerous things they are doing environmentally.
[01:47:24.526 --> 01:47:26.408]  Well, you'd have to look at individual cases.
[01:47:26.628 --> 01:47:28.931]  Ben O'Gore, it seems to me, probably does believe this stuff.
[01:47:29.251 --> 01:47:29.572]  I don't know.
[01:47:44.287 --> 01:47:46.948]  He's the majority owner of Occidental Petroleum.
[01:47:47.028 --> 01:47:48.409]  Yeah, so they have double think.
[01:47:48.509 --> 01:47:50.150]  I suppose you can call this double think.
[01:47:50.210 --> 01:48:02.396]  In other words, oligarchs have always hated technology, they hate science, they hate progress, and they've got to find a way that defines the rest of humanity as somehow bestial.
[01:48:03.016 --> 01:48:07.118]  And inferior to them, because the oligarchs' problem is always, why should you be an oligarch?
[01:48:07.138 --> 01:48:14.162]  Why should you rule and not somebody else that's smarter, you know, more moral, more honest, and just generally more desirable than you?
[01:48:14.182 --> 01:48:16.403]  So they're going to say, well, we're the oligarchs.
[01:48:16.483 --> 01:48:17.844]  Pelosi summed this up once.
[01:48:18.304 --> 01:48:23.407]  People camped out in front of her house during the Iraq War, and she said, we are leaders.
[01:48:23.907 --> 01:48:25.408]  You are mere advocates.
[01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:27.829]  You're only agitating for this or that idea.
[01:48:27.889 --> 01:48:30.771]  We take the responsibility of ruling.
[01:48:31.511 --> 01:48:33.692]  We have a bankrupt ruling class.
[01:48:33.712 --> 01:48:34.672]  I think this is important.
[01:48:34.692 --> 01:48:36.512]  It also gets into the discussion of what do they know.
[01:48:37.293 --> 01:48:43.574]  If you look at the endowments of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and MIT, they have lost between one quarter and one third.
[01:48:44.114 --> 01:48:49.876]  The Harvard case is something that's going to be in the news now at the end of the month, the June 30th, coming up now.
[01:48:50.538 --> 01:48:54.680]  We will know the losses of the Harvard endowment, which is the largest one.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.841]  It's going to be 25%, 30%, might be 35%.
[01:48:58.641 --> 01:48:59.822]  How did they lose all the money?
[01:49:00.222 --> 01:49:07.845]  When Larry Summers, who is now running the economic policy for Obama, when Larry Summers, the woman hater, remember him, right?
[01:49:07.885 --> 01:49:08.905]  Women can't do science.
[01:49:09.305 --> 01:49:16.228]  Larry Summers, president of Harvard, said to the people managing the endowment, put the endowment into derivatives, derivatives, derivatives.
[01:49:16.548 --> 01:49:19.850]  And naturally, when that blew up, there were the losses.
[01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:27.155]  Now, the question is, did Larry Summers, as an oligarch and a financier, know what he was doing?
[01:49:27.275 --> 01:49:28.136]  I would say he didn't.
[01:49:28.276 --> 01:49:30.858]  He wouldn't have put all the Harvard endowment into derivatives.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.741]  If he had actually realized that the bubble was coming down.
[01:49:35.121 --> 01:49:39.942]  I think it's the problem of the oligarchy is they believe the world is overpopulated.
[01:49:39.962 --> 01:49:42.503]  They hate technology and they love bubbles.
[01:49:42.763 --> 01:49:45.104]  Every time there's an economic bubble, they run.
[01:49:45.204 --> 01:49:46.384]  It's like a heroin addiction.
[01:49:46.424 --> 01:49:47.464]  They can't help themselves.
[01:49:47.905 --> 01:49:49.045]  And everything else they do
[01:49:49.825 --> 01:49:52.747]  Is subordinated to this idea that we've got to have bubble.
[01:49:52.767 --> 01:49:54.067]  We've got to have a bubble economy.
[01:49:54.107 --> 01:49:55.328]  We've got to have globalization.
[01:49:55.828 --> 01:50:00.210]  And this is just the most recent form of things, you know, going back... Well, what do you see happening?
[01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:03.212]  Because we're going to come back and get to... I mean, we're going to come back and go to Karl's Webster.
[01:50:03.232 --> 01:50:03.972]  I've got to stop you.
[01:50:04.833 --> 01:50:06.453]  How do you see this unfolding, though?
[01:50:06.473 --> 01:50:17.379]  I mean, if things aren't going well for them, but they've still got the, you know, the force of their mass moving them forward, grinding over us, how does this all end?
[01:50:18.257 --> 01:50:19.779]  Well, the situation of the U.S.
[01:50:19.839 --> 01:50:20.720]  is desperate, right?
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:23.644]  And we've got a thermodynamic breakdown going on.
[01:50:23.684 --> 01:50:26.427]  If you look at this crash on the Washington subway line, right?
[01:50:26.507 --> 01:50:29.991]  Nine dead on the subway that I take, you know, many days a week.
[01:50:31.373 --> 01:50:33.716]  That's scary in the same area, right?
[01:50:34.156 --> 01:50:39.904]  This should be the area where they keep everything nice for the imperialist bureaucrats, right, in southern Maryland.
[01:50:40.825 --> 01:50:42.387]  They've had two big water main breaks.
[01:50:42.407 --> 01:50:46.432]  So we're approaching the point of physical breakdown, and that's got to be addressed.
[01:50:46.452 --> 01:50:49.516]  Somebody's got to come out and say, we've got to rebuild everything.
[01:50:49.597 --> 01:50:51.179]  Marshall Plan for the United States.
[01:50:51.559 --> 01:50:53.601]  But the bankers don't care.
[01:50:54.082 --> 01:50:58.987]  They want to destroy cities with bulldozers and they're all going to live in palaces offshore.
[01:50:59.007 --> 01:51:06.015]  We're going to take calls and get into the stage terror and the economy later.
[01:51:06.035 --> 01:51:06.676]  Stay with me Webster.
[01:51:07.509 --> 01:51:10.431]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:51:10.591 --> 01:51:15.834]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:51:16.114 --> 01:51:21.477]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:51:21.817 --> 01:51:22.958]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:23.318 --> 01:51:32.323]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:51:32.363 --> 01:51:32.603]  Yes.
[01:51:32.623 --> 01:51:34.245]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:51:34.466 --> 01:51:38.651]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:51:38.671 --> 01:51:43.316]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:51:43.697 --> 01:51:45.359]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:48.281]  Keep it natural.
[01:51:48.621 --> 01:51:56.784]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:08.571]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:08.752 --> 01:52:13.737]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:52:14.117 --> 01:52:16.199]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:25.789]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[01:52:26.049 --> 01:52:27.551]  This program has already set
[01:52:27.551 --> 01:52:28.171]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.384]  And save you thousands of dollars today.
[01:52:58.625 --> 01:52:59.567]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[01:52:59.587 --> 01:52:59.627]  800-324-6554.
[01:52:59.647 --> 01:53:00.108]  The Bailout Group.
[01:53:07.438 --> 01:53:09.300]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:14.604]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:53:14.784 --> 01:53:16.125]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:53:16.385 --> 01:53:24.572]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:53:24.792 --> 01:53:30.517]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:53:30.677 --> 01:53:32.479]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:53:32.519 --> 01:53:34.701]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:53:34.721 --> 01:53:39.086]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:53:39.246 --> 01:53:41.388]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:53:41.469 --> 01:53:49.337]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:53:49.397 --> 01:53:51.837]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[01:53:51.857 --> 01:53:52.198]  That's 866-295-5305.

[01:54:21.247 --> 01:54:26.270]  Alright, I'm going to take ten calls or so for Webster, then we're going to get into false black terror, that ace in the hole.
[01:54:26.891 --> 01:54:32.914]  This huge police state, open martial law, open forced inoculations, swine flu hysteria.
[01:54:33.535 --> 01:54:36.617]  They're only intensifying the fear-mongering and hyping.
[01:54:37.897 --> 01:54:39.578]  And that's what's so important about all this.
[01:54:40.099 --> 01:54:41.740]  So that's coming up with Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.902]  Right now, let's go to Warren in California.
[01:54:45.302 --> 01:54:46.923]  Warren, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:54:47.743 --> 01:54:48.324]  Okay, Alex.
[01:54:48.704 --> 01:54:49.905]  I have two things I want to mention.
[01:54:50.638 --> 01:55:10.473]  I believe it was Sunday night on Coast to Coast that George, that set in for George Norrie from Las Vegas, his news at the beginning of the show, he mentioned that two Japanese individuals were apprehended on the Italian border, and they had $120 billion in U.S.
[01:55:10.773 --> 01:55:11.273]  Treasuries.
[01:55:11.834 --> 01:55:14.996]  No, no, that was in Bloomberg and Associated Press.
[01:55:15.096 --> 01:55:17.257]  That is true, so we'll ask Tarpley about that.
[01:55:17.318 --> 01:55:17.638]  Go ahead.
[01:55:18.772 --> 01:55:20.232]  I have no particular opinion.
[01:55:20.252 --> 01:55:26.793]  It's a lot of money, but Switzerland is a paradise of flight capital, so I don't know.
[01:55:26.833 --> 01:55:27.874]  Is that really that new?
[01:55:28.214 --> 01:55:29.474]  The amount is rather large.
[01:55:30.994 --> 01:55:31.894]  And what's the other point?
[01:55:32.374 --> 01:55:33.275]  What's the other point, Caller?
[01:55:34.395 --> 01:55:39.296]  Yes, I have an article from 1983 of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:55:39.336 --> 01:55:40.456]  I don't have it right here with me.
[01:55:40.476 --> 01:55:42.356]  It's about 400 miles away in storage.
[01:55:42.716 --> 01:55:43.296]  That's okay.
[01:55:43.757 --> 01:55:46.137]  But the article says the feds
[01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:47.611]  We're good.
[01:56:01.945 --> 01:56:10.492]  Yeah, they made folks turn their gold in, and then they gave paper money back in the new year later double the price.
[01:56:10.853 --> 01:56:16.658]  They are talking about taking private property, seizing pensions to feed that into the bankers.
[01:56:16.718 --> 01:56:18.259]  So let me ask Webster about that.
[01:56:22.162 --> 01:56:31.404]  Reserve, quote, reform bill, openly, I'm sure you've seen it Webster, says they can take over from a hot dog stand to a car dealership.
[01:56:31.804 --> 01:56:47.667]  Obama, it's admitted, if you give millions to the Democratic Party, he'll let your GM dealership stay open, but if you don't make the payoffs, they give it to somebody else or shut it down, even though it has an incredible value, they take the franchise.
[01:56:48.527 --> 01:56:49.467]  Give us your take on that.
[01:56:49.707 --> 01:57:00.332]  Well, that is the corporate state, the Mussolini fascist corporate state, as imposed now by the Wall Street banking community, where the Wall Street banking community takes over the government and runs it.
[01:57:00.372 --> 01:57:05.354]  Now, of course, in the middle of that, somebody like Obama's got to maintain his own political interest.
[01:57:05.374 --> 01:57:07.715]  I would just point to this Federal Reserve question, though.
[01:57:08.215 --> 01:57:22.551]  The point of Obama's regulation is that the Fed becomes the regulator of systemic risk, and as you say, can therefore argue that the hot dog stand poses systemic risk to the derivatives bubble and the banking community.
[01:57:23.212 --> 01:57:25.295]  That got a very bad reception in Congress.
[01:57:25.375 --> 01:57:28.078]  A lot of Democrats in the House who don't like that one.
[01:57:28.158 --> 01:57:32.542]  I saw, I think, Brad Sherman of California was one of them.
[01:57:32.583 --> 01:57:33.564]  He said he didn't like it.
[01:57:33.944 --> 01:57:41.793]  And now you've got this thing, Congressman Issa, also of California, has come out with this thing about Bernanke engaging in threats.
[01:57:42.333 --> 01:57:49.095]  And blackmail against another villain, another finance oligarch, Lewis, the head of Bank of America.
[01:57:49.535 --> 01:58:02.558]  And while we've been talking today, there have been hearings in the House Banking Committee where Bernanke has been treated rougher than I've ever seen a Fed chairman get treated by a whole bunch of congressmen, including Republicans and Democrats.
[01:58:02.618 --> 01:58:11.440]  It's sort of conservative Republicans, anti-Wall Street Republicans, if you will, and at the same time sort of these New Deal Democrats getting together
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:13.161]  To beat up Bernanke.
[01:58:13.301 --> 01:58:19.827]  I think now the political vulnerability of the Federal Reserve is probably greater than it ever was.
[01:58:19.907 --> 01:58:22.849]  I think the auditing of the Fed is a great idea that should be done.
[01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:27.954]  And then go on, though, because that will then have more scandals.
[01:58:28.354 --> 01:58:30.496]  Time to have new Pecora hearings against the Fed.
[01:58:30.516 --> 01:58:31.877]  All right, stay there, Webster.
[01:58:31.897 --> 01:58:32.538]  We're going to come back.
[01:58:32.618 --> 01:58:37.082]  I want you to elaborate on, if you audit the Fed, that begins the
[01:58:38.746 --> 01:58:41.007]  ending of the Fed or the federalization of it.
[01:58:41.488 --> 01:58:42.808]  This has never been federal, folks.
[01:58:43.429 --> 01:58:48.191]  And we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarbly in one minute.

[02:00:00.074 --> 02:00:01.978]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:02.459 --> 02:00:05.244]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.853 --> 02:00:20.055]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.095 --> 02:00:21.796]  We're talking to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:00:21.856 --> 02:00:23.538]  He's handling your phone calls.
[02:00:23.578 --> 02:00:26.381]  We haven't even gotten into the ace in the hole.
[02:00:26.421 --> 02:00:29.324]  The establishment has staged crises.
[02:00:29.804 --> 02:00:34.849]  So it's all coming up in the next 30 minutes or so with our guest.
[02:00:34.889 --> 02:00:39.774]  And we've got some other video clips and news I want to cover after he leaves us near the end of this transmission.
[02:00:42.228 --> 02:00:47.610]  I'm going to go to Johan, Anthony, Annie, and others, Robert, in just a moment.
[02:00:48.210 --> 02:00:49.630]  Webster, you're talking about ending the Fed.
[02:00:49.670 --> 02:01:00.014]  I mean, this is so criminal, so obviously corrupt, it's coming out that Congress is subpoenaing over Bank of America, ordering them to buy up different assets, different brokerage firms.
[02:01:00.694 --> 02:01:07.899]  Because, you know, the big mega-bankers at the Volcker or Kissinger or David Rockefeller level, they're always in the news.
[02:01:07.939 --> 02:01:14.883]  In fact, Volcker is in the news today in Bloomberg at press conferences, blaming the CEOs, blaming the brokerage firm heads.
[02:01:15.164 --> 02:01:15.824]  Who aren't they?
[02:01:15.864 --> 02:01:21.288]  Just hired captains or mercenaries for the larger investment groups?
[02:01:21.968 --> 02:01:30.254]  And isn't this the elite trying to throw a few little bankers or middle-sized bankers to the wolves to throw the wolves off?
[02:01:31.134 --> 02:01:34.415]  Of their trail of the bloodhounds, off of their trail.
[02:01:34.455 --> 02:01:35.215]  What's going on here?
[02:01:36.976 --> 02:01:42.257]  The fascist corporate state, and it is a government-sponsored compulsory cartel.
[02:01:43.257 --> 02:01:47.838]  It obeys the logic of finance, right, of Wall Street in this case.
[02:01:48.278 --> 02:01:53.379]  A government-sponsored compulsory cartel for the purpose of driving down production.
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:54.580]  You see that in Detroit.
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:55.500]  Factories close.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.260]  Driving down wages.
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:59.521]  The UAW has had to eat tremendous
[02:02:00.183 --> 02:02:03.764]  Bosses, right, they've been driven down to sweatshop wage levels.
[02:02:04.225 --> 02:02:15.249]  So you're going to drive down production, you're going to drive down wages, and you're going to prop up the fictitious derivatives and the other fictitious pieces of paper capital that are floating around.
[02:02:15.689 --> 02:02:27.334]  Notice the big robbery in the Detroit business, with General Motors in particular, was a $6 billion payment in cash was made to Citibank and JPMorgan Chase
[02:02:27.934 --> 02:02:37.422]  While the UAW, instead of getting guaranteed healthcare from General Motors, they got some shares of General Motors stock, which I think are likely to be worthless.
[02:02:37.442 --> 02:02:42.446]  So the risk, the risk was shifted off of General Motors and shifted onto the UAW.
[02:02:42.546 --> 02:02:50.473]  Another good example, the people who say that Obama is helping the unions must be standing on their heads, because he's doing the opposite.
[02:02:50.513 --> 02:02:54.797]  He's destroyed the UAW, he's driven down their wages, he's taken away their benefits.
[02:02:55.817 --> 02:02:59.900]  He's looted their health care funds, and he's going to do the same thing with the teachers' union.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.683]  So Obama is a consummate union buster, so much so that a lot of people can't even see what he's doing.
[02:03:05.723 --> 02:03:11.066]  But the UAW basically voted themselves out of existence as any kind of an industrial union.
[02:03:11.106 --> 02:03:13.228]  But this is all part of the corporate state.
[02:03:13.588 --> 02:03:14.769]  You've got to create a cartel.
[02:03:15.029 --> 02:03:16.810]  It means you've got to discipline the others.
[02:03:17.090 --> 02:03:20.152]  A lot of little fish are going to get fed to a lot of big fish.
[02:03:20.612 --> 02:03:22.373]  The winners are picked by the government, right?
[02:03:22.393 --> 02:03:25.335]  Based on, well, JPMorgan Chase is a winner.
[02:03:25.696 --> 02:03:26.896]  Goldman Sachs is a winner.
[02:03:26.917 --> 02:03:29.779]  The Citibank looks more and more like a loser.
[02:03:29.839 --> 02:03:32.040]  Bank of America, probably a loser.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.944]  And actually the squawking you hear from Wall Street is from the people who are on the losing end.
[02:03:37.304 --> 02:03:39.345]  Look at Washington Mutual Bank, right?
[02:03:39.365 --> 02:03:40.286]  The savings bank.
[02:03:40.626 --> 02:03:42.107]  Fed to JPMorgan Chase.
[02:03:42.147 --> 02:03:44.068]  A lot of people very, very upset about that.
[02:03:44.529 --> 02:03:47.371]  Or Bank of America told, you are going to eat the losses.
[02:03:47.971 --> 02:03:48.993]  Of Merrill Lynch, right?
[02:03:49.013 --> 02:03:55.781]  This is all the disciplining that goes on in, again, the fascist corporate state, because that's the only way to describe it.
[02:03:57.046 --> 02:04:10.051]  So, if they are unopposed, would they reduce us to Stone Age running around in loincloths while they're in armored compounds and in high technology reservations away from us?
[02:04:10.131 --> 02:04:19.154]  I mean, because that's what they describe in their white papers while they, I guess, have hunter-killer robots out like Zardoz hunting us down or something?
[02:04:19.710 --> 02:04:25.312]  Well, I mean, it may eventually come to that, but what you can see right now with Obama is the following.
[02:04:25.692 --> 02:04:27.473]  I was being somewhat sarcastic, Webster.
[02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:30.293]  My point is, is there just no end to their thieving?
[02:04:30.333 --> 02:04:32.974]  They will destroy all of civilization for themselves.
[02:04:33.014 --> 02:04:42.657]  Again, the $1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble is a black hole, and you can shovel all the austerity loot and sacrifices and cuts into that you want.
[02:04:43.038 --> 02:04:47.279]  It's still going to be bankrupt, so that means they're going to gouge Medicare and Medicaid
[02:04:47.933 --> 02:04:54.435]  And then, says Orsag, they're going to go on and start reducing your Social Security pension, which for a lot of people is going to be the only thing they have.
[02:04:54.455 --> 02:04:57.116]  Yeah, because none of the taxes you pay will go to any services now.
[02:04:57.176 --> 02:05:00.218]  It's all the debt created out of nothing by the bankers.
[02:05:00.258 --> 02:05:00.598]  Stay there.
[02:05:00.658 --> 02:05:01.758]  And derivatives bailouts.
[02:05:02.138 --> 02:05:03.139]  Yeah, derivatives bailouts.
[02:05:03.159 --> 02:05:06.600]  Going to come back and blitz through the phone calls on the other side of Webster Griffin Tarbling.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.566]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[02:05:12.866 --> 02:05:14.028]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:05:14.168 --> 02:05:18.152]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[02:05:18.452 --> 02:05:19.994]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:05:20.314 --> 02:05:26.601]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:05:27.742 --> 02:05:30.283]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:05:30.603 --> 02:05:32.084]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:05:32.344 --> 02:05:35.125]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:05:35.345 --> 02:05:36.785]  And their formula really works.
[02:05:37.065 --> 02:05:39.626]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:05:39.886 --> 02:05:41.147]  Try the Nutri-Cafe.
[02:05:41.387 --> 02:05:45.789]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:48.349]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:05:48.549 --> 02:05:50.830]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:52.771]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:05:53.111 --> 02:05:54.232]  Go to www.
[02:05:55.632 --> 02:05:56.112]  We're good.
[02:06:07.093 --> 02:06:12.098]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:12.318 --> 02:06:16.101]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:16.341 --> 02:06:21.946]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:22.247 --> 02:06:27.111]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:27.311 --> 02:06:27.812]  Number three,
[02:06:28.212 --> 02:06:33.657]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:06:34.518 --> 02:06:37.180]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:06:37.421 --> 02:06:40.824]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:41.925 --> 02:06:45.548]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:45.768 --> 02:06:51.272]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:06:51.512 --> 02:06:56.055]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:57.976 --> 02:07:00.297]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[02:07:07.867 --> 02:07:10.468]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:10.888 --> 02:07:15.850]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:16.210 --> 02:07:17.951]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:18.251 --> 02:07:23.033]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:24.946 --> 02:07:25.186]  I think?
[02:07:43.544 --> 02:07:44.004]  Let's do it!
[02:08:08.797 --> 02:08:14.819]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:18.461]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.185 --> 02:08:30.566]  Alright, Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest.
[02:08:30.586 --> 02:08:33.067]  I want you to hurry through your phone calls so I can get into...
[02:08:34.445 --> 02:08:44.772]  But separate from Webster's solutions and ideas he's got, where he sees them taking us, and politically as a realist, how he sees things unfolding.
[02:08:46.133 --> 02:08:52.918]  Because I agree with him, without some type of stage crises or terror attacks, Obama
[02:08:54.191 --> 02:08:59.172]  Is a political commodity that is losing value by the day.
[02:09:00.072 --> 02:09:01.633]  And you will see an acceleration.
[02:09:01.953 --> 02:09:07.534]  We've seen him lose, depending on the poll gauge, 20 to 30 plus points the last three months.
[02:09:08.495 --> 02:09:11.075]  And we see an acceleration in that loss.
[02:09:11.795 --> 02:09:12.555]  So that's important.
[02:09:12.575 --> 02:09:13.536]  That's coming up in a few minutes.
[02:09:13.856 --> 02:09:17.277]  Right now, let's talk to Johan in Europe.
[02:09:17.317 --> 02:09:18.117]  Thanks for holding, Johan.
[02:09:20.111 --> 02:09:31.775]  I would like Webster Tarpoli to explain how the state of Israel could influence the country of Cyprus to prevent Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney's second attempt to break the illegal blockade of Gaza.
[02:09:32.175 --> 02:09:35.276]  Tonight she's going to be on Mike Rivero, What Really Happened.
[02:09:36.076 --> 02:09:48.060]  As even before the vote had docked at the Cyprus port, there was an official waiting there with papers saying that it was unseaworthy, even before he had even taken a look at it.
[02:09:49.141 --> 02:09:49.601]  How could
[02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:52.669]  This little country has so much influence on...
[02:09:54.939 --> 02:09:56.160]  Well, I'm envious of Mike.
[02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:57.401]  I know Cynthia McKinney.
[02:09:58.681 --> 02:10:01.163]  People always say, oh, she'll come on, and then it always falls through.
[02:10:01.203 --> 02:10:04.344]  But I'm going to get an interview set up with her, but I appreciate your call.
[02:10:04.725 --> 02:10:06.626]  Yeah, Israel ramming her boat.
[02:10:06.646 --> 02:10:08.927]  She's trying to bring medical supplies in to Gaza.
[02:10:09.567 --> 02:10:12.969]  And then I did see a blurb about now they won't even let her into Cyprus.
[02:10:13.969 --> 02:10:20.493]  And it's pretty obvious the United States and Israeli lobby is very, very strong over the police state that is Cyprus.
[02:10:20.553 --> 02:10:22.454]  But let's get Webster's comment on that.
[02:10:22.967 --> 02:10:28.490]  Well, I certainly condemn the Israeli blockade of Gaza, and I condemn what the Israelis did there.
[02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:30.270]  They killed about 1,500 people.
[02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:32.051]  And you didn't see the U.S.
[02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:39.895]  media screaming about 1,500 people dead, as they have now about a much smaller number, as far as we know, in Iran.
[02:10:40.035 --> 02:10:48.779]  And I would also point out that what Obama and Netanyahu are talking about is not really a two-state solution, but it's actually a kind of Bantustan.
[02:10:49.477 --> 02:10:57.427]  Where there would be a limited sovereignty or maybe autonomy, self-administration, Banterstan, for the Palestinians.
[02:10:57.467 --> 02:11:02.533]  I think what you've got to have is an independent Palestinian state with real sovereignty.
[02:11:03.174 --> 02:11:06.355]  But again, none of that will work without an economic development program for the area.
[02:11:06.395 --> 02:11:11.137]  There's got to be a Marshall Plan for the entire Middle East, or nothing else will work.
[02:11:11.217 --> 02:11:15.098]  And if that would have been done 60 years ago, all this fighting wouldn't have happened.
[02:11:15.118 --> 02:11:25.162]  The people are in starvation level, and you're going to continue to have incredible conflict, which is what the bomb makers, which is what the defense establishment wants.
[02:11:25.202 --> 02:11:29.143]  They love a few hot zones they can dump weapon systems into.
[02:11:29.163 --> 02:11:30.784]  I mean, this is really just business.
[02:11:31.314 --> 02:11:37.319]  And of course, Obama's Cairo speech had nothing in terms of economics for the Palestinians.
[02:11:37.339 --> 02:11:40.542]  The unemployment in these areas is 50-60%.
[02:11:40.682 --> 02:11:42.183]  It's out of this world.
[02:11:42.323 --> 02:11:52.371]  But Webster, Webster, doesn't that fit, though, with the Obama model of, he says, I'm going to be friendly to the Middle East and Persia, and then they launch the CIA destabilization.
[02:11:52.672 --> 02:11:54.973]  Whatever he says, it's the opposite.
[02:11:55.013 --> 02:11:58.756]  So he does the emotional salve, so there's not a blowback on the West.
[02:11:59.497 --> 02:12:02.922]  And so there's a debate about whether we did this or not, when obviously they did.
[02:12:02.942 --> 02:12:04.244]  Go ahead.
[02:12:05.246 --> 02:12:10.474]  The idea with Obama is he's trying to appear to do a favor for the Arabs and the Palestinians.
[02:12:10.514 --> 02:12:11.756]  He's really not doing anything.
[02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:22.040]  With the goal then of using them as dupes, again, kamikaze puppets against China, cut off the oil, Russia, pick a fight with Russia, any way you can.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:29.868]  So it's not a good deal, it's pure demagogy, it's more of that trickery and dissembling that we've talked about as the hallmark of Obama.
[02:12:31.895 --> 02:12:32.596]  Absolutely.
[02:12:32.676 --> 02:12:35.918]  Okay, let's go to Anthony in California.
[02:12:36.038 --> 02:12:37.019]  Anthony, you're on the air.
[02:12:37.039 --> 02:12:39.580]  Hey Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:41.502]  I got seven questions I'd like to ask.
[02:12:41.662 --> 02:12:46.145]  First of all, I heard you guys talking about bulldozing cities and towns in California.
[02:12:46.305 --> 02:12:47.366]  I live in California.
[02:12:47.966 --> 02:12:48.706]  What can I do?
[02:12:48.826 --> 02:12:52.589]  The second thing is I live on a naval base where military laws every day.
[02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:53.770]  You're not allowed to own a gun.
[02:12:54.974 --> 02:12:57.296]  Third of all, how do I make a big impact?
[02:12:57.756 --> 02:13:00.639]  That's wake up more people, influence the government with no money.
[02:13:01.299 --> 02:13:04.642]  Fourth of all, how do I arm myself for under $20 if I can?
[02:13:05.242 --> 02:13:09.726]  Fifth of all, front-side training, unfortunately, is far too expensive for me and my father.
[02:13:10.366 --> 02:13:10.526]  It's $1,000.
[02:13:11.387 --> 02:13:12.888]  My dad doesn't even make that much.
[02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:14.309]  What can I do?
[02:13:14.329 --> 02:13:24.017]  Number six, if North Korea strikes with a nuclear weapon and it's total martial law and the police come and try to take me and my dad away, what can I do?
[02:13:24.904 --> 02:13:26.365]  And fifth, I want to make a comment.
[02:13:26.785 --> 02:13:40.555]  There was an episode of a show called Star Trek Enterprise, where there was this Terran Empire, a parallel universe version of the Federation of Planets, that basically everything they're doing now, the New World Order, is what they do in that show.
[02:13:41.076 --> 02:13:49.162]  It's got an earth with a logo, the logo is a sword, where the handle is above the North Pole and the blade tip is below.
[02:13:50.942 --> 02:13:53.183]  All right, let me try to answer that.
[02:13:53.203 --> 02:13:56.383]  I didn't even have time to write all those questions.
[02:13:57.244 --> 02:13:59.004]  You ask about how to get firearms training.
[02:13:59.044 --> 02:14:00.884]  There are a lot of free manuals online.
[02:14:00.924 --> 02:14:02.725]  Frontsight.com has some.
[02:14:04.665 --> 02:14:09.767]  If you can afford a firearm, I would suggest for training, something like a single shot .22.
[02:14:10.047 --> 02:14:12.187]  You can get decent ones for like $100.
[02:14:12.847 --> 02:14:16.048]  Go out, shooting range.
[02:14:16.068 --> 02:14:17.389]  .22 rounds are very inexpensive.
[02:14:17.429 --> 02:14:18.509]  Learn how to shoot with that.
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:22.184]  And then you can buy something else a little more high-powered if you want.
[02:14:23.666 --> 02:14:29.914]  But for training, there are a lot of manuals, online training, simple safety stuff, how to use a firearm.
[02:14:31.206 --> 02:14:33.727]  I mean, there were just so many questions in there.
[02:14:33.887 --> 02:14:37.649]  I mean, let's take the false flag stage terror situation.
[02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:45.332]  The controllers, the oligarchs, could stage a nuke attack and say that North Korea had done it.
[02:14:45.772 --> 02:14:47.133]  They could do anything.
[02:14:47.493 --> 02:14:50.294]  That's why the head of ABB, Rumsfeld,
[02:14:50.954 --> 02:14:53.096]  Gave the reactors in North Korea to begin with.
[02:14:53.356 --> 02:14:55.638]  That's why the West helped arm Pakistan.
[02:14:55.938 --> 02:15:01.002]  This is all part of destabilization, so they can then play the part of the saviors later.
[02:15:02.102 --> 02:15:02.883]  Webster Tarbley.
[02:15:03.423 --> 02:15:19.936]  Let me just say, in the 1930s, what you see is, when you get depression, really serious economic depression of the type we're going to have increasingly, if you don't solve the depression, and fight the depression, and defeat it, and get a recovery, and some kind of turn towards prosperity,
[02:15:20.516 --> 02:15:23.357]  Then you fall into dictatorship, right?
[02:15:23.397 --> 02:15:24.938]  Germany, best example.
[02:15:24.958 --> 02:15:31.240]  But every place in Europe obviously went in some form of dictatorship, or just about every place.
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:35.762]  If you want to avoid that, you've got to address the economic crisis.
[02:15:35.802 --> 02:15:37.462]  You've got to end the economic crisis.
[02:15:37.502 --> 02:15:42.064]  The only way you do that is with these American system or New Deal measures.
[02:15:42.464 --> 02:15:46.828]  The Austrian side argues, well, we've got to let the depression play out.
[02:15:46.868 --> 02:15:48.749]  We've got to let it take its course, right?
[02:15:48.769 --> 02:15:49.830]  We can't do anything about it.
[02:15:50.151 --> 02:15:53.473]  It's part of a cycle, and the cycle is not controllable by us.
[02:15:53.574 --> 02:15:53.794]  No.
[02:15:54.154 --> 02:15:55.175]  We can and we must.
[02:15:55.575 --> 02:15:59.739]  So, the Tobin Tax, stop foreclosures, usually laws, and things like this.
[02:16:00.419 --> 02:16:05.804]  You've got to defend civilization in California through political action, and that's what I recommend.
[02:16:06.284 --> 02:16:07.064]  Political action.
[02:16:07.144 --> 02:16:08.105]  Be political, right?
[02:16:08.125 --> 02:16:08.925]  Whatever else you do.
[02:16:09.045 --> 02:16:13.027]  Do all these other things, if that's what you think is required.
[02:16:13.087 --> 02:16:17.408]  But the one thing you've got to have is political action, and it's got to be programmatic.
[02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:23.691]  And generally speaking, the problem, as we see, is that the right-wing critique of Obama doesn't get anywhere.
[02:16:23.791 --> 02:16:26.692]  And you can see this because this is what Obama loves.
[02:16:26.752 --> 02:16:31.614]  He's always talking about Hannity and Limbaugh and all these characters.
[02:16:31.994 --> 02:16:34.256]  This is the opposition that he desires.
[02:16:34.596 --> 02:16:37.778]  He wants you to have to choose between Limbaugh and Obama.
[02:16:37.818 --> 02:16:38.879]  That's a terrible choice.
[02:16:39.059 --> 02:16:41.601]  That helps Obama destabilize himself.
[02:16:41.941 --> 02:16:53.170]  What I think is likely to happen is a left-wing challenge, some kind of a New Deal challenge, to Obama coming out of the Democratic Party in the same way that Ted Kennedy, a weak vessel though he was to be sure,
[02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:59.114]  Ted Kennedy gave Carter a real serious challenge, which then crippled Carter.
[02:16:59.534 --> 02:17:04.837]  I think that is what might happen in the Democratic Party, say, towards the end of next year.
[02:17:04.857 --> 02:17:08.300]  Alright, let's take another phone call here.
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:12.182]  Let's talk to Annie in New York.
[02:17:12.302 --> 02:17:13.483]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:13.903 --> 02:17:15.564]  Good afternoon, thank you both.
[02:17:15.825 --> 02:17:17.345]  First an observation, a quick one.
[02:17:17.366 --> 02:17:19.447]  You know, a couple of months ago, all the
[02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:22.599]  Mainstream media outlets were pushing Twitter, remember?
[02:17:22.619 --> 02:17:33.103]  I mean, it was so orchestrated, it was like when all of the corporations came out with the, you know, boxes of goods on the store shelf in three languages, you know.
[02:17:33.704 --> 02:17:36.945]  But now they're saying, oh, this Twitter revolution in Iran.
[02:17:37.814 --> 02:17:41.536]  It's just, it makes me so sick that it's so orchestrated.
[02:17:41.836 --> 02:17:43.858]  Well, by the way, ma'am, that's not your opinion.
[02:17:43.918 --> 02:18:00.847]  The State Department and the CIA admit that they were running Twitter during this, and even stopped Twitter from doing regular maintenance that might shut down Twitter for a few hours one night when this was happening, and that these were artificial Twitters telling people they'd lost the election that had been stolen from them.
[02:18:01.168 --> 02:18:02.208]  It was all staged.
[02:18:02.268 --> 02:18:06.611]  The external polls, nothing to do with the Iranian government, showed
[02:18:07.031 --> 02:18:08.392]  That Ahmedinejad was the winner.
[02:18:09.732 --> 02:18:17.876]  And this was a way to then get these youth, swarming adolescent masses, as Webster rightly calls them, to go out.
[02:18:17.896 --> 02:18:24.980]  And then suddenly our government's all for revolution, while it puts out Department of Homeland Security reports saying protesting is illegal.
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.941]  Webster, have you seen these documents?
[02:18:28.541 --> 02:18:33.283]  Where they're saying the army's being taught all protest is illegal, and they're going to be shutting it down.
[02:18:33.323 --> 02:18:37.544]  I mean, they're certainly getting ready for martial law, but I don't see them getting away with it.
[02:18:37.924 --> 02:18:39.504]  Well, the irony is that the U.S.
[02:18:39.544 --> 02:18:42.105]  foreign policy is now based on mob rule.
[02:18:42.685 --> 02:18:44.146]  What's their prescription for Iran?
[02:18:44.186 --> 02:18:45.626]  They say, we want mob rule.
[02:18:45.686 --> 02:18:46.566]  Forget about elections.
[02:18:46.906 --> 02:18:47.727]  We want mobs.
[02:18:47.827 --> 02:18:48.767]  We want rioters.
[02:18:49.708 --> 02:19:00.058]  The irony is, of course, then, that the same television channels were confronted with real vote fraud in the United States in the year 2000, in Florida and other places.
[02:19:00.538 --> 02:19:04.122]  In 2004, in Ohio, vote fraud in favor of Bush.
[02:19:04.702 --> 02:19:07.724]  When they were confronted with real vote fraud, they ignored it.
[02:19:07.764 --> 02:19:09.765]  They didn't have any time for that, right?
[02:19:10.005 --> 02:19:12.246]  They just swept that aside.
[02:19:12.306 --> 02:19:14.268]  So they have no credibility.
[02:19:14.508 --> 02:19:17.189]  And the Iranian thing is just a big fraud.
[02:19:17.329 --> 02:19:20.631]  And Twitter, I guess, is a cultural campaign.
[02:19:20.791 --> 02:19:23.373]  And you're right, the State Department and the CIA
[02:19:24.493 --> 02:19:27.194]  Obviously run, or at least partially run, Twitter.
[02:19:27.274 --> 02:19:29.675]  So don't believe anything you see on Twitter.
[02:19:29.895 --> 02:19:33.116]  It's also great when you turn on CNN and they're reporting what's on Twitter.
[02:19:33.436 --> 02:19:39.058]  Twitter is a sewer where anybody can float anything they want and have it reported then on CNN.
[02:19:40.139 --> 02:19:42.919]  Well, I mean, it's clear that it's come out.
[02:19:42.959 --> 02:19:44.320]  I'm sure you've seen the articles, Webster.
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:48.821]  Just admitting CIA and State Department run Twitter.
[02:19:48.862 --> 02:19:49.862]  I mean, it's their tool.
[02:19:51.698 --> 02:19:52.758]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:19:52.778 --> 02:19:54.059]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:19:54.119 --> 02:19:55.479]  The price of food continues to rise.
[02:20:16.946 --> 02:20:18.567]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:20:18.947 --> 02:20:22.409]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:20:22.749 --> 02:20:25.911]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:38.418]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:20:38.739 --> 02:20:41.160]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:41.960]  It is a big idea.
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:43.041]  A new world order.
[02:21:11.764 --> 02:21:16.045]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[02:21:16.645 --> 02:21:19.446]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:21:19.486 --> 02:21:21.727]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:21:22.267 --> 02:21:24.727]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:25.448 --> 02:21:32.770]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:35.802 --> 02:21:40.765]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:41.246 --> 02:21:44.728]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:45.108 --> 02:21:47.610]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:48.831]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:48.851 --> 02:21:49.611]  They're not after money.
[02:21:49.631 --> 02:21:50.712]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:50.912 --> 02:21:51.633]  They're after power.
[02:21:51.893 --> 02:21:52.753]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:21:53.034 --> 02:22:01.299]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:01.759 --> 02:22:02.140]  Endgame.
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:04.341]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:22:04.561 --> 02:22:05.622]  You have been warned.
[02:22:06.603 --> 02:22:07.584]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:07.664 --> 02:22:12.448]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:22:12.608 --> 02:22:20.414]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:22:20.694 --> 02:22:26.059]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:22:26.259 --> 02:22:33.245]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:22:33.525 --> 02:22:38.867]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:22:39.127 --> 02:22:43.849]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:22:44.189 --> 02:22:51.811]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:22:52.131 --> 02:22:58.374]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:58.694 --> 02:22:59.814]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.555 --> 02:23:03.396]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:05.897 --> 02:23:11.880]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:12.981]  Take a deep breath.
[02:23:13.901 --> 02:23:20.204]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[02:23:20.445 --> 02:23:21.485]  Have a glass of water.
[02:23:21.985 --> 02:23:26.748]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other
[02:23:30.452 --> 02:23:30.832]  I think so.
[02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:48.560]  I think so.
[02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:14.125]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:24:14.145 --> 02:24:16.607]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:17.608 --> 02:24:19.730]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:20.290]  to 3 p.m.
[02:24:20.650 --> 02:24:22.912]  Central Standard Time.
[02:24:22.992 --> 02:24:25.895]  Back on the network 9 p.m.
[02:24:25.935 --> 02:24:26.535]  to 1 a.m.
[02:24:26.575 --> 02:24:28.257]  Retransmitted to Genesis.
[02:24:28.477 --> 02:24:31.039]  Replayed back-to-back on the internet streams at Infowars.com 24-7.
[02:24:31.059 --> 02:24:32.200]  And I come in Sundays.
[02:24:35.555 --> 02:24:36.376]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:24:36.416 --> 02:24:40.498]  Central Standard Time, 5 to 7 Eastern, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:40.618 --> 02:24:46.242]  I'm going to hold Tarpy a few minutes in the next hour to finish up with Paul Slagterer after we're done with calls and we're going to let him go.
[02:24:46.322 --> 02:24:53.387]  Really appreciate his detailed analysis and breakdown today of where he sees the world and how things are unfolding.
[02:24:53.427 --> 02:24:54.548]  Great perspective, always.
[02:24:55.609 --> 02:24:57.710]  Let's go back to Annie in New York.
[02:24:57.730 --> 02:24:58.831]  You had one other question, Annie?
[02:24:59.231 --> 02:25:02.714]  Yeah, and just give me a minute and I'll get off the phone and he can answer.
[02:25:03.544 --> 02:25:07.386]  You know, you've got the CIA and the corporate media with Operation Mockingbird.
[02:25:07.867 --> 02:25:10.088]  Congress has been bought off by the corporations.
[02:25:10.628 --> 02:25:11.769]  The courts are corrupt.
[02:25:11.829 --> 02:25:14.091]  Homeland Security has bought off law enforcement.
[02:25:14.631 --> 02:25:21.495]  You know, the biggest story of the decade should have been about that FEMA videographer, Kurt Sonnenfeld.
[02:25:22.136 --> 02:25:29.660]  And, you know, Webster thinks that we can do it through elections when we know that all these computerized voting machines are rigged.
[02:25:30.601 --> 02:25:32.402]  You know, people say when push comes to shove,
[02:25:32.987 --> 02:25:34.088]  Gee, aren't we there yet?
[02:25:35.549 --> 02:25:41.294]  Well, that's certainly the pessimism of the intelligence, but I think you've got to supplement that with the optimism of the will.
[02:25:41.615 --> 02:25:47.100]  I don't say through voting alone, but through a mass movement that would get political and have a program.
[02:25:47.825 --> 02:25:51.208]  You've got to know how to end the depression, and slogans will not do it.
[02:25:51.268 --> 02:25:52.389]  Free market won't do it.
[02:25:52.789 --> 02:25:54.070]  You know, big government is bad.
[02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:54.751]  That won't do it.
[02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:56.032]  You've got to know what you want.
[02:25:56.052 --> 02:25:57.193]  It's got to be very specific.
[02:25:57.213 --> 02:25:58.514]  Well, I know at least this.
[02:25:58.814 --> 02:26:01.316]  I know we can do at least this, and it's simple and it's true.
[02:26:01.736 --> 02:26:04.438]  The private bankers, the Federal Reserve, they did this.
[02:26:04.498 --> 02:26:05.239]  It's their fault.
[02:26:05.639 --> 02:26:07.160]  Their answer is more of the same.
[02:26:07.221 --> 02:26:08.261]  Expanding what they're doing.
[02:26:08.662 --> 02:26:09.462]  Audit the Fed.
[02:26:09.883 --> 02:26:10.903]  Arrest the bankers.
[02:26:11.244 --> 02:26:12.385]  Prosecute them.
[02:26:12.745 --> 02:26:14.506]  The Federal Reserve broke the law with this
[02:26:15.467 --> 02:26:16.488]  Bank of America thing.
[02:26:16.528 --> 02:26:18.969]  That's like Bush breaking the law with warrantless wiretapping.
[02:26:19.289 --> 02:26:21.830]  He tries to get Congress to pass a retroactive.
[02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:24.812]  That's what this federal takeover of the Federal Reserve is.
[02:26:25.452 --> 02:26:30.195]  This reform is them trying to legalize the crimes they've already committed.
[02:26:30.495 --> 02:26:32.096]  Arrest the bastards.
[02:26:32.396 --> 02:26:33.776]  Get that drumbeat going.
[02:26:33.877 --> 02:26:34.557]  End the Fed.
[02:26:34.657 --> 02:26:35.517]  Arrest the Fed.
[02:26:35.858 --> 02:26:40.200]  And then, with them removed, we can just having them off our back.
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:44.844]  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll then open a vacuum of, okay, what's the solution?
[02:26:45.104 --> 02:26:48.326]  But until you arrest these bastards, I don't see anything happening.
[02:26:48.847 --> 02:26:51.709]  And add to that, who should pay for the depression?
[02:26:51.809 --> 02:26:52.730]  This is a depression.
[02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:53.691]  Who should pay?
[02:26:54.131 --> 02:27:07.402]  The bankers say, Obama said, we should pay, we should have Medicare, Medicaid gouged, we should lose our Social Security pensions, we should have the defendant of barbarism, old people on welfare should die, what you're seeing in California.
[02:27:07.743 --> 02:27:09.064]  Who should pay for the depression?
[02:27:09.324 --> 02:27:11.065]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:27:11.205 --> 02:27:12.246]  You're not just saying that.
[02:27:12.306 --> 02:27:14.427]  Biden has said that.
[02:27:14.507 --> 02:27:18.469]  Daschle wrote a book saying old people don't get brain surgery.
[02:27:18.649 --> 02:27:19.709]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[02:27:19.769 --> 02:27:23.011]  I mean, you cannot make up how evil these people are.
[02:27:23.471 --> 02:27:30.515]  And again, they use the right wing to say no welfare, nothing, you know, all taxing is stealing, and at a certain level it is, but then
[02:27:31.415 --> 02:27:37.578]  They use that phony right-wing argument to make sure all the tax money instead just goes to offshore banks, and we get none of it.
[02:27:37.638 --> 02:27:44.001]  I mean, it is just... And the left is saying, tax the middle class, they're the enemy, when that's the main engine.
[02:27:44.401 --> 02:27:47.022]  I mean, it's everything is engineered to consolidate power.
[02:27:47.283 --> 02:27:48.443]  Let's take another call here.
[02:27:48.483 --> 02:27:56.487]  Let's talk to Robert in Texas, and Robert in California and others, but we have an endless... We have a call from Italy, we'll go to next for that.
[02:27:57.107 --> 02:27:58.548]  Go ahead, Robert in Texas.
[02:27:59.534 --> 02:28:03.077]  Hi Mr. Jones, Mr. Tarpley, pleasure to talk to you all today.
[02:28:03.177 --> 02:28:08.362]  I'm going to go through just something real quick here in regards to what the last lady said.
[02:28:08.662 --> 02:28:12.926]  I think that if everybody does just a little bit, or just what they can, that will make a difference.
[02:28:12.946 --> 02:28:16.329]  I mean a bucket of water is not a lot, but a million buckets of water is a torrent.
[02:28:17.449 --> 02:28:27.098]  And with that being said, I have called before because every once in a while I try to get on the radio shows, the mainstream radio shows, and put a little truth on there.
[02:28:27.219 --> 02:28:29.281]  And I was able to get into Sean Hannity's show.
[02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:41.893]  I was able to get by his screener and talk about how the Bilderberg Conference fixes the oil prices and how Mr. Tucker and Mr. Esselin were able to predict that two years before the huge spike last summer.
[02:28:43.237 --> 02:28:44.719]  Yeah, no, I put that in Endgame.
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:48.185]  What did he say when what's documented in Endgame came out?
[02:28:48.446 --> 02:28:50.048]  Did he just say it didn't exist and hung up?
[02:28:50.816 --> 02:28:58.922]  Well, what happened was, I had the video up on my channel, it's Funkmaster5, I've called here before, and that's 5 spelt out, not the number.
[02:29:00.503 --> 02:29:08.049]  He started ranting about conspiracies, and he even mentioned a mothership UFO flying around or something like that.
[02:29:08.149 --> 02:29:14.314]  And then he hung up on me promptly before I could mention Endgame, because I had plenty more to say, but he cut me off pretty quick.
[02:29:15.455 --> 02:29:16.296]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:29:16.376 --> 02:29:26.546]  I mean, Hannity admits they're trying to set up a Bank of the World New World Order, and he says, oh, we're right, but only because he has to give us lip service the rest of the time he's there trying to discredit us.
[02:29:27.387 --> 02:29:29.108]  Webster, this isn't going to work anymore.
[02:29:29.128 --> 02:29:32.732]  There is a world empire being set up, and they can't deny it.
[02:29:33.581 --> 02:29:35.322]  Look, I was at a conference recently.
[02:29:35.382 --> 02:29:40.464]  I put a picture of Lewis of Bank of America, Blank Fine of Goldman Sachs, Pandit of Citibank.
[02:29:40.864 --> 02:29:44.545]  I said, whoever gets all three gets a copy of my new book, Surviving the Cataclysm.
[02:29:44.905 --> 02:29:46.166]  Nobody could name all three.
[02:29:46.466 --> 02:29:50.947]  And I suggested, read less about flying saucers and more about your class enemies.
[02:29:51.348 --> 02:29:52.548]  Those are the bankers.
[02:29:54.129 --> 02:29:55.589]  Absolutely, they are criminals.
[02:29:55.609 --> 02:29:56.409]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:57.610 --> 02:29:58.550]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.010 --> 02:30:00.491]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:04.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:06.925 --> 02:30:08.026]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:08.306 --> 02:30:10.088]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:30:10.308 --> 02:30:10.949]  Well, you should.
[02:30:11.289 --> 02:30:15.553]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:30:15.773 --> 02:30:16.253]  That's right.
[02:30:16.594 --> 02:30:26.483]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:30:26.603 --> 02:30:27.744]  Plus, if you act fast,
[02:30:27.944 --> 02:30:33.569]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:30:33.929 --> 02:30:40.455]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:30:40.815 --> 02:30:46.020]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:47.481]  This is real.
[02:30:47.801 --> 02:30:48.542]  Don't miss out.
[02:30:48.862 --> 02:30:55.728]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:30:55.948 --> 02:30:57.228]  And get your free handgun.
[02:30:57.408 --> 02:30:59.589]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:30:59.769 --> 02:31:03.270]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[02:31:03.470 --> 02:31:06.431]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:31:07.232 --> 02:31:07.812]  Hello, friends.
[02:31:07.872 --> 02:31:08.792]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:31:08.932 --> 02:31:13.554]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:31:13.674 --> 02:31:16.434]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:31:16.635 --> 02:31:19.495]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:31:19.675 --> 02:31:23.337]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:31:23.497 --> 02:31:24.397]  In any emergency,
[02:31:24.617 --> 02:31:25.558]  If you simply prepare.
[02:31:25.758 --> 02:31:28.681]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:31:29.001 --> 02:31:35.888]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:31:35.988 --> 02:31:39.111]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:31:39.271 --> 02:31:39.532]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:41.934 --> 02:31:44.376]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:31:44.396 --> 02:31:50.481]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:31:50.661 --> 02:31:54.424]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:54.444 --> 02:31:55.765]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:31:55.785 --> 02:31:56.386]  Take action today.
[02:31:56.426 --> 02:31:58.207]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:32:07.441 --> 02:32:10.824]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:32:10.964 --> 02:32:16.189]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:32:16.369 --> 02:32:21.133]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:32:21.333 --> 02:32:32.303]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:32:32.583 --> 02:32:38.150]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:32:38.330 --> 02:32:44.398]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:32:44.558 --> 02:32:45.199]  What about you?
[02:32:45.439 --> 02:32:47.342]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[02:32:47.362 --> 02:32:50.045]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[02:32:51.627 --> 02:32:53.870]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:54.170]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[02:32:54.270 --> 02:32:55.852]  Or order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.
[02:32:55.872 --> 02:32:57.274]  That's Directive, the number 21 dot com now.
[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:23.505]  Alright, I want to give you some financial news, break down briefly what I think happened with that governor, play some clips.
[02:33:25.006 --> 02:33:29.910]  I went to four hours a year ago because I wanted more time and now it seems like four hours isn't enough.
[02:33:29.970 --> 02:33:32.251]  That's probably my fault.
[02:33:33.652 --> 02:33:42.139]  Going back to Webster Griffin Tarbley and a few final calls and then he wants to talk some about this news about could there be a bank holiday?
[02:33:42.159 --> 02:33:47.203]  Because we've been hearing about and confirming that the embassies are
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:51.649]  Being told, dump their cash, their U.S.
[02:33:51.689 --> 02:33:53.936]  dollars, and buy up the local currency.
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.000]  Now is that for war?
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:58.861]  Is that for a bank holiday coming?
[02:33:59.381 --> 02:34:15.226]  We'll get Tarbly's brief comments on that in a moment and talk some about false flag terror, the ace in the hole for the establishment that we've got to expose, as he says, break that tool by exposing that tool so they can't do that to make people rally around the system and run into the skirts of the establishment.
[02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:19.508]  But Salvatore in Italy, you're on the air, go ahead sir.
[02:34:22.769 --> 02:34:23.949]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[02:34:24.670 --> 02:34:25.851]  Yes I can, Salvatore.
[02:34:25.891 --> 02:34:26.211]  Welcome.
[02:34:27.152 --> 02:34:27.352]  Hi.
[02:34:28.833 --> 02:34:31.475]  I'd like to talk with Webster Starpley.
[02:34:31.855 --> 02:34:32.656]  You're on the air with him.
[02:34:33.056 --> 02:34:33.796]  Avanti.
[02:34:35.277 --> 02:34:35.958]  Ciao Webster.
[02:34:35.978 --> 02:34:36.338]  Senti.
[02:34:36.518 --> 02:34:41.181]  Ti posso parlare in italiano?
[02:34:41.241 --> 02:34:42.462]  Maybe I can make it real quick.
[02:34:42.502 --> 02:34:43.483]  I'll translate it for you.
[02:34:44.144 --> 02:34:44.564]  But quick.
[02:34:44.644 --> 02:34:44.804]  Okay.
[02:34:46.867 --> 02:34:51.130]  The question is, am I following Berlusconi?
[02:34:51.250 --> 02:34:53.912]  What's happening to Berlusconi?
[02:34:54.032 --> 02:34:58.655]  Yeah, why are they doing the scandal with the hookers?
[02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:05.900]  This is an attack that comes from the British and the London intelligence centers.
[02:35:12.774 --> 02:35:14.656]  I think we understand the question, Salvatore.
[02:35:14.676 --> 02:35:15.496]  Let me just answer.
[02:35:16.297 --> 02:35:21.461]  Berlusconi is the most pro-Russian of all the European leaders.
[02:35:22.082 --> 02:35:23.463]  And this is a tradition in Italy.
[02:35:23.483 --> 02:35:25.004]  It goes back to the 20s and 30s.
[02:35:25.104 --> 02:35:32.410]  Even under fascism, you had companies like Fiat and others going into Russia, Soviet Union then, building things.
[02:35:32.811 --> 02:35:36.554]  Berlusconi is a big guy for the South Stream.
[02:35:37.374 --> 02:35:42.700]  All these guys have girlfriends and they're all allowed to have them, and boyfriends, as long as they don't...
[02:35:56.155 --> 02:35:56.896]  Get out of line.
[02:35:56.936 --> 02:36:01.939]  The minute they do, like an Eliot Spitzer, or this other Governor, Mark Sanford, it's over.
[02:36:02.239 --> 02:36:03.860]  Are you saying that's happening with Berlusconi?
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:04.701]  Yeah, obviously.
[02:36:04.761 --> 02:36:08.203]  Again, he is the most pro-Russian of all the Europeans.
[02:36:09.104 --> 02:36:10.805]  He's the best from this point of view.
[02:36:10.825 --> 02:36:21.432]  In other words, he wants... The obvious thing for Europe is promote East-West trade, promote energy exchange, European technology... Okay, so he was good for Bush and one of the few allies...
[02:36:23.753 --> 02:36:28.336]  He's an opportunist, of course.
[02:36:28.356 --> 02:36:29.496]  He's an opportunist.
[02:36:29.637 --> 02:36:35.180]  During the Gulf War, he was... You've got to remember, who was giving you the nuclear umbrella?
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:38.101]  And one of the things he was interested in was maintaining a U.S.
[02:36:38.141 --> 02:36:39.722]  nuclear umbrella over Italy.
[02:36:39.742 --> 02:36:46.706]  But the other thing is, if you look at where the Italian troops went, they went to the Italian-owned ENI, the state oil company.
[02:36:48.007 --> 02:36:50.490]  They went to guard the Amy oil wells in Iraq.
[02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:51.431]  They didn't do anything else.
[02:36:51.491 --> 02:36:56.857]  They were just there to secure Italian interests, and then Bush said, oh, they're joining us in the fighting front.
[02:36:57.117 --> 02:36:58.919]  They didn't do the fighting front, they did guarding.
[02:36:59.019 --> 02:37:00.361]  I understand they hyped all that.
[02:37:00.381 --> 02:37:05.686]  I mean, you could have a, you know, maid from Czechoslovakia, Czech Republican, they'd say the Czechs were supporting.
[02:37:05.987 --> 02:37:08.690]  Does that answer your question, or do you have any other comments, Salvatore?
[02:37:09.999 --> 02:37:21.704]  I want to say that the Sunday Times and the Times of London, who are attacking prominently against Berlusconi and the owner of this... Rupert Murdoch!
[02:37:21.804 --> 02:37:24.285]  It's Rupert Murdoch going around talking to the hookers, yes.
[02:37:26.466 --> 02:37:32.029]  He has a lot of problems with the Sky Network.
[02:37:38.153 --> 02:37:52.104]  If Berlusconi wants to fight back, he should invite Larry Sinclair to come to Italy and tell his story and see how that stacks up against the alleged peccadilloes of Berlusconi.
[02:37:53.092 --> 02:37:53.852]  Take the offense.
[02:37:53.992 --> 02:37:56.353]  The defense is always hopeless, as Paolo Sarpi says.
[02:37:56.373 --> 02:38:02.735]  Well, I mean, most of the elite in the United States like men, and they're probably mad that he likes 20-year-old blondes or something.
[02:38:02.775 --> 02:38:03.155]  I don't know.
[02:38:03.496 --> 02:38:05.056]  But it's very upsetting what he's doing.
[02:38:05.096 --> 02:38:11.818]  That's why they're probably going after... That's probably why Matt Drudge is going after Mark Sanford.
[02:38:12.139 --> 02:38:14.679]  If Sanford was dating men, it'd be okay.
[02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:17.400]  I think that's a little bit different, Alex.
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:21.782]  It seems to me the idea there is just to prevent any national figure
[02:38:22.362 --> 02:38:26.203]  Who could be a focus of resistance to Obama from emerging.
[02:38:26.463 --> 02:38:27.683]  I was being sarcastic.
[02:38:27.883 --> 02:38:28.383]  I was being sarcastic.
[02:38:28.403 --> 02:38:32.024]  I don't see anything good about Sanford, you know, not taking the stimulus money.
[02:38:32.344 --> 02:38:36.025]  He didn't want to pay unemployment benefits to the unemployed people in South Carolina.
[02:38:36.045 --> 02:38:36.825]  Hey, I'm joking, Webster.
[02:38:37.166 --> 02:38:38.166]  Webster, it's a joke.
[02:38:38.626 --> 02:38:39.286]  I understand that.
[02:38:39.606 --> 02:38:41.647]  Thank you so much, Salvatore from Italy.
[02:38:41.667 --> 02:38:42.747]  Call back again, okay?
[02:38:45.748 --> 02:38:46.108]  Ciao.
[02:38:46.488 --> 02:38:47.048]  Take care, buddy.
[02:38:48.496 --> 02:38:50.677]  Uh, hey, I know the word, huh?
[02:38:50.757 --> 02:38:51.318]  There you go.
[02:38:51.518 --> 02:38:54.900]  Hey, I can call my wife in here right now and get her to speak Italian to you, Tarpley.
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:56.120]  See how good you speak Italian.
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:56.501]  Great!
[02:38:57.601 --> 02:38:59.943]  No, I'm not going to drag her in here.
[02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:00.963]  She doesn't want to be on TV.
[02:39:01.023 --> 02:39:01.503]  I'll tell you what.
[02:39:01.844 --> 02:39:05.205]  Let's bring my wife in and have her speak Italian to Tarpley, but don't put her on TV.
[02:39:05.466 --> 02:39:06.366]  She hates being on TV.
[02:39:06.766 --> 02:39:07.627]  Will you call her in here?
[02:39:08.047 --> 02:39:08.767]  Call Violet in here?
[02:39:10.268 --> 02:39:12.790]  Actually, we're going to test your Italian, Tarpley.
[02:39:13.210 --> 02:39:14.971]  You're always saying how good you are at it.
[02:39:15.331 --> 02:39:16.472]  We're going to test it right now.
[02:39:17.944 --> 02:39:19.586]  You know what Chow Bombo means?
[02:39:20.106 --> 02:39:20.907]  Chow Bumblebee.
[02:39:20.987 --> 02:39:25.031]  I don't know what Chow Bimbo means.
[02:39:25.111 --> 02:39:28.434]  Well, Bimbo is strictly speaking a child, but then in the U.S.
[02:39:28.494 --> 02:39:29.235]  it means something else.
[02:39:29.315 --> 02:39:30.036]  No, I know.
[02:39:30.076 --> 02:39:31.057]  Hey, come on in here!
[02:39:31.077 --> 02:39:32.258]  Tarpley!
[02:39:33.139 --> 02:39:33.980]  Come in here, Violet!
[02:39:34.906 --> 02:39:35.947]  Just don't put her on TV.
[02:39:35.987 --> 02:39:36.647]  Come on in here!
[02:39:36.667 --> 02:39:39.288]  We've got to have something original and exciting here on air.
[02:39:39.869 --> 02:39:42.450]  Tarpley's in there showing off speaking Italian to Italian listeners.
[02:39:42.730 --> 02:39:45.752]  So I want you to speak Italian to Webster Tarpley.
[02:39:46.192 --> 02:39:50.495]  Because I was just saying, Ciao Bumblebee, and he was saying other horrid things, I think, mean things towards you.
[02:39:51.275 --> 02:39:53.237]  Anyways, I'm just joking, Tarpley.
[02:39:53.257 --> 02:39:54.077]  We know we love you.
[02:39:54.198 --> 02:39:56.099]  Hi Webster Tarpley.
[02:39:56.139 --> 02:39:56.439]  Here, here.
[02:39:56.459 --> 02:39:56.780]  Hello there.
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:39:58.001]  Good to meet you in Italian.
[02:39:58.381 --> 02:39:59.822]  Ciao, come sta?
[02:40:00.623 --> 02:40:01.684]  Bene, signora.
[02:40:05.146 --> 02:40:05.767]  Quit laughing.
[02:40:05.787 --> 02:40:08.169]  Sit in the chair normally instead of leaning over it and talk to him.
[02:40:08.649 --> 02:40:09.910]  I don't know what you want me to say.
[02:40:09.930 --> 02:40:11.312]  Just talk to him about the New World Order.
[02:40:12.472 --> 02:40:13.733]  Uh, can we do it in French?
[02:40:14.093 --> 02:40:15.913]  No, no, no, do it in Italian.
[02:40:15.953 --> 02:40:16.714]  You're good at Italian.
[02:40:16.734 --> 02:40:17.634]  I urge you to talk to an Italian.
[02:40:17.714 --> 02:40:19.554]  Non ci piace in the world order.
[02:40:19.574 --> 02:40:20.455]  I don't know what to say.
[02:40:20.475 --> 02:40:27.857]  I don't know, like... We don't want the new world order.
[02:40:27.877 --> 02:40:29.057]  No, no, no.
[02:40:29.077 --> 02:40:30.518]  No per piacere in the world order.
[02:40:30.538 --> 02:40:31.318]  Niente.
[02:40:31.718 --> 02:40:32.478]  Niente, niente.
[02:40:32.738 --> 02:40:33.479]  Okay, ciao.
[02:40:33.779 --> 02:40:35.779]  Tell everybody how handsome I am in Italian.
[02:40:35.859 --> 02:40:36.200]  No.
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:37.920]  I'm just having some fun, honey.
[02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:40.561]  Hey, hey, hey, is the new world order not out of control?
[02:40:42.552 --> 02:40:43.633]  It is out of control.
[02:40:43.653 --> 02:40:45.193]  Hey, CMC of Tarpley speaks some French.
[02:40:45.553 --> 02:40:46.074]  Let's hear that.
[02:40:47.194 --> 02:40:47.574]  Go ahead.
[02:40:47.894 --> 02:40:48.414]  What do you want?
[02:40:48.434 --> 02:40:49.275]  Qu'est-ce que tu veux?
[02:40:49.455 --> 02:40:51.576]  No, no, talk to Tarpley about the new order in French.
[02:40:52.156 --> 02:40:52.796]  Okay.
[02:40:53.036 --> 02:40:54.577]  Ask him about the stimulus package.
[02:40:55.277 --> 02:40:55.837]  Okay.
[02:40:56.497 --> 02:40:57.518]  I don't know what... It's much harder.
[02:40:57.538 --> 02:41:01.379]  I don't know how you say stimulus.
[02:41:01.459 --> 02:41:03.020]  I don't know how you... I can't hear him.
[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:04.160]  I can't hear him.
[02:41:04.741 --> 02:41:11.163]  Mr. Sarkozy soutiens le nouveau ordre mondial des anglo-americains.
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:12.840]  It's a puppet!
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:13.180]  It's a puppet!
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:14.561]  It's a puppet from London!
[02:41:32.785 --> 02:41:33.265]  Quelle honte!
[02:41:33.566 --> 02:41:34.827]  Quelle honte pour les Français!
[02:41:34.907 --> 02:41:36.108]  What a shame for the French!
[02:41:36.468 --> 02:41:37.529]  Quelle honte, yes.
[02:41:37.609 --> 02:41:38.489]  Quelle honte pour eux.
[02:41:38.549 --> 02:41:39.290]  Oui, c'est vrai.
[02:41:39.350 --> 02:41:40.471]  C'est terrible.
[02:41:40.651 --> 02:41:41.371]  Il est terrible.
[02:41:41.532 --> 02:41:41.812]  Voilà.
[02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:44.774]  Terrible.
[02:41:44.874 --> 02:41:45.435]  Okay.
[02:41:45.595 --> 02:41:46.455]  I'm just having some fun.
[02:41:46.475 --> 02:41:47.996]  We gotta have occasional craziness, honey.
[02:41:48.377 --> 02:41:49.938]  A tout à l'heure, madame.
[02:41:49.998 --> 02:41:52.039]  C'est un plaisir de vous parler.
[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:53.861]  Et c'est vraiment... C'était fou, hein?
[02:41:55.610 --> 02:42:00.173]  Hey, hey, say, say, say, say, long live the Republic, death to the New World Order in French.
[02:42:01.794 --> 02:42:03.274]  How do you say that, Mr. Tarpley?
[02:42:03.314 --> 02:42:04.395]  Viva la Republique!
[02:42:05.476 --> 02:42:06.916]  Morale!
[02:42:06.976 --> 02:42:07.797]  Morale!
[02:42:07.897 --> 02:42:10.278]  On bat le nouveau ordre économique mondial!
[02:42:10.578 --> 02:42:10.999]  Voilà!
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:13.900]  Tarpley, something else.
[02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:19.003]  Hey, hey, let's see, let's see how Tarpley does on the Spanish.
[02:42:19.724 --> 02:42:22.165]  And then let's do... I never made any claims, Alex.
[02:42:22.485 --> 02:42:23.966]  Let's do the Denmark speak.
[02:42:27.365 --> 02:42:29.267]  I think we may be losing listeners with all this.
[02:42:50.623 --> 02:42:50.943]  Thank you.
[02:42:51.363 --> 02:42:51.703]  You bet.
[02:42:51.743 --> 02:43:01.646]  Now, I don't have the time to take any more calls, but I do want to spend a few minutes here with you, specifically getting into false flag terror.
[02:43:01.886 --> 02:43:04.527]  Couldn't we do the bank holiday since this is what I prepared?
[02:43:04.567 --> 02:43:04.887]  No, no, no.
[02:43:04.947 --> 02:43:05.587]  I mean, do both.
[02:43:05.627 --> 02:43:05.947]  Go ahead.
[02:43:05.987 --> 02:43:06.427]  Just go ahead.
[02:43:06.527 --> 02:43:06.767]  Okay.
[02:43:07.108 --> 02:43:15.690]  Look, the bank holiday, the reason I want to mention the bank holiday is because there should be a bank holiday in the following sense, that any Friday
[02:43:16.602 --> 02:43:23.570]  Sheila Bair should go and shut down the top money center banks, starting with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America.
[02:43:24.091 --> 02:43:25.092]  And she doesn't do it.
[02:43:25.272 --> 02:43:32.620]  And that's the whole secret of this system, is to keep them going as zombie banks, when they should be shut down, because they are so bankrupt.
[02:43:33.081 --> 02:43:35.724]  The stress test that was done, as we learn,
[02:43:36.525 --> 02:43:42.931]  Completely ignored the question of derivatives, and that's like saying, you know, if you weren't head over heels in debt, you wouldn't be bankrupt.
[02:43:42.971 --> 02:43:48.836]  Well, the point is, you are head over heels in debt, and you are bankrupt if you're one of these zombie bankers.
[02:43:48.896 --> 02:43:50.637]  So, this is what is not done.
[02:43:50.677 --> 02:43:56.823]  Now, the notion of the bank holiday, this has been around now for the last six months, because clearly the U.S.
[02:43:56.903 --> 02:43:58.204]  banking system is completely
[02:43:58.914 --> 02:43:59.394]  Bankrupt.
[02:43:59.694 --> 02:44:05.077]  What you've got to remember, though, is that the Roosevelt Bank holiday did not close any banks.
[02:44:05.517 --> 02:44:07.818]  Those banks were already shut down.
[02:44:08.239 --> 02:44:13.381]  The whole banking system had ground to a halt on the night before Roosevelt took office.
[02:44:13.761 --> 02:44:16.463]  It all comes out of the British default on gold in September 1931.
[02:44:16.523 --> 02:44:17.123]  You then had 2300 U.S.
[02:44:17.143 --> 02:44:18.004]  banks blow up.
[02:44:21.065 --> 02:44:22.966]  Do you think we're going to see that here?
[02:44:41.656 --> 02:44:49.521]  I don't think so, because I think that the whole idea of Obama is to keep this system of zombie banks open.
[02:44:49.541 --> 02:44:53.363]  And again, I write about this in my newest book, Surviving the Cataclysm.
[02:44:53.423 --> 02:44:59.587]  I have a whole chapter, Models of Disintegration, which is about the 1932-33 banking crisis.
[02:44:59.907 --> 02:45:00.347]  You know what?
[02:45:00.467 --> 02:45:04.430]  I'll have you back on in the next few weeks just specifically about that for a few hours.
[02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.990]  Thank you.
[02:45:05.370 --> 02:45:08.151]  Because we're almost out of time, but I do want to briefly get you to get a shirt.
[02:45:08.171 --> 02:45:10.693]  One last thing, though, is what's coming is a dollar crisis.
[02:45:10.733 --> 02:45:11.993]  In other words, the reason the U.S.
[02:45:12.053 --> 02:45:15.315]  embassies are selling dollars is there's going to be a dollar panic.
[02:45:15.335 --> 02:45:17.876]  There's going to be a rush to the exit sometime soon.
[02:45:18.336 --> 02:45:19.897]  Everybody tries to dump dollars.
[02:45:20.397 --> 02:45:24.239]  It would be very much in the interest of the world to have that not be chaotic.
[02:45:24.719 --> 02:45:42.022]  But to find a way to repatriate the dollars, let's say, you could say to China, look, you want to do healthcare in rural China, we can sell you a thousand U.S.-made hospitals with everything in them, turnkey hospitals, so you can improve health conditions in rural China, or in rural Russia, because they have a lot of dollars, too.
[02:45:42.322 --> 02:45:50.384]  In other words, let them buy things, capital goods, real big improvements, right, things that will permanently help them, not consumer goods or...
[02:45:51.164 --> 02:45:53.905]  Webster, we're just out of time here, so we're going to have to cut that off there.
[02:45:54.325 --> 02:45:55.826]  Specifically, false flag terror.
[02:45:55.886 --> 02:45:56.206]  Quickly.
[02:45:56.546 --> 02:45:57.727]  Well, it could be anything, right?
[02:45:58.127 --> 02:45:59.748]  Look at the pattern inside this country.
[02:45:59.788 --> 02:46:06.850]  We had CHO at Virginia Tech in the spring of 2007, so you can have college students as terrorists.
[02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:10.272]  You've had a whole bunch of Columbine-type events.
[02:46:10.312 --> 02:46:11.852]  They've been going on in the background.
[02:46:12.313 --> 02:46:15.054]  And now, more recently, you've had this Van Braun, right?
[02:46:16.252 --> 02:46:25.916]  The guy at the Holocaust Museum here in the United States, and they attack him as being a 9-11 truther and a birther.
[02:46:25.976 --> 02:46:34.300]  Somebody who's interested in the question of Obama's birth certificate, sort of the stuff that Phil Berg has been looking into in his law cases.
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:35.661]  That looks staged to me.
[02:46:37.042 --> 02:46:38.003]  These are all patsies.
[02:46:38.103 --> 02:46:39.264]  Every one of them is a patsy.
[02:46:39.284 --> 02:46:41.025]  That goes without saying.
[02:46:41.526 --> 02:46:51.614]  But then you could also have false flag terror obviously targeting the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russia, China, people in Central Asia, people like this.
[02:46:52.728 --> 02:46:54.330]  India, possibly.
[02:46:55.410 --> 02:46:56.792]  More likely Pakistan.
[02:46:56.812 --> 02:46:59.494]  I mean, more likely the new enemies list.
[02:46:59.594 --> 02:47:06.720]  Of course, where India is... No, I meant activate some of the Hindu terror groups blaming on Muslims.
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:07.421]  Right.
[02:47:07.501 --> 02:47:08.241]  Oh yes, precisely.
[02:47:08.261 --> 02:47:10.303]  And that's exactly what was done, right?
[02:47:10.323 --> 02:47:12.986]  That was Mumbai last summer.
[02:47:15.027 --> 02:47:16.027]  In the past year.
[02:47:16.527 --> 02:47:17.928]  So, the door for that is open.
[02:47:17.988 --> 02:47:25.930]  Again, the line from the ruling elite was, as Andrew Sullivan said it in the Atlantic Monthly, with Bush, nobody would believe him.
[02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:29.791]  You couldn't do false flag anymore because nobody but nobody would believe Bush.
[02:47:30.211 --> 02:47:35.412]  They would accuse him of incompetence or some would even say you did it yourself as a provocation.
[02:47:35.492 --> 02:47:39.473]  So, the door for this, from the point of view of the US ruling elite, is open.
[02:47:40.505 --> 02:47:42.107]  I don't think in the world that's true.
[02:47:42.127 --> 02:47:46.610]  In other words, I don't think people are going to believe Obama very much more than they would have believed Bush.
[02:47:46.651 --> 02:47:55.398]  But the danger is that the people in Wall Street and the Council on Foreign Relations and these people, the State Department, they believe that they might be able to get away with this now.
[02:47:55.458 --> 02:47:57.540]  So we have to be very vigilant.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:00.022]  And of course, don't be stampeded no matter what happens.
[02:48:00.282 --> 02:48:01.663]  All right, Webster, great job.
[02:48:01.723 --> 02:48:03.924]  Thanks for spending two hours and forty minutes with us.
[02:48:03.964 --> 02:48:05.165]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:48:05.545 --> 02:48:08.347]  And you're in the Obama Deception and in the upcoming Obama film.
[02:48:08.367 --> 02:48:10.448]  Right, and more power to you with these documentaries.
[02:48:10.488 --> 02:48:13.590]  They're a tremendous ingredient in changing the political climate.
[02:48:14.050 --> 02:48:16.431]  Well, more power to you and the listeners who are getting them out there, people.
[02:48:16.752 --> 02:48:17.472]  Take care, Webster.
[02:48:17.632 --> 02:48:18.012]  Bye-bye.
[02:48:18.453 --> 02:48:18.913]  There he goes.
[02:48:19.013 --> 02:48:25.797]  Okay, now I want to come back into Sanford, because I promised to do it briefly, with his weird Illuminati comments and things, and his Bilderberg group connection.
[02:48:26.097 --> 02:48:27.518]  But then why are they burning him?
[02:48:27.538 --> 02:48:29.079]  Did he go against them or something?
[02:48:29.679 --> 02:48:34.581]  Just the way the media built this up, where is he, and then brought out it was with a woman, that's clearly a psy-op.
[02:48:34.981 --> 02:48:37.642]  Because him with a woman by itself isn't big national news.
[02:48:37.902 --> 02:48:38.422]  That's coming up.
[02:48:38.602 --> 02:48:45.325]  But for two minutes, before I go to break, Ted Anderson, he's been holding for like ten while I held Tarpley over, because I wanted to have Ted back on.
[02:48:45.605 --> 02:48:47.465]  Gold and silver went up again today!
[02:48:47.745 --> 02:48:57.289]  But Ted has the price of gold that he bought when it was $20 lower, and silver when it was lower, and he could pass that savings on to you, and in these uncertain times, it's win-win-win-win-win.
[02:48:58.109 --> 02:49:01.051]  Ted sells this to you right at his cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:01.271 --> 02:49:07.655]  He sells it from when he bought it earlier at a lower price, still at a lower price now, and he supports this network, what we're doing.
[02:49:07.715 --> 02:49:08.755]  Get into gold and silver.
[02:49:08.775 --> 02:49:16.480]  If it's ten gold coins or ten silver coins or one gold coin or one silver coin, get into it, physically holding it.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:21.583]  Ted, you still, for a little while longer, you told me, got some of the coins left at a lower price.
[02:49:21.883 --> 02:49:24.285]  Yeah, that's exactly what I have right now, Alex.
[02:49:24.325 --> 02:49:25.426]  We got the prices lower.
[02:49:25.466 --> 02:49:26.567]  We quoted them yesterday.
[02:49:26.607 --> 02:49:28.849]  We both have seen gold and silver go up today.
[02:49:28.909 --> 02:49:31.811]  Again, I'm holding the prices just exactly where they were yesterday.
[02:49:32.432 --> 02:49:33.793]  The Lakota coin right now, $19.70.
[02:49:33.833 --> 02:49:35.134]  Silver went over $14 an ounce.
[02:49:35.194 --> 02:49:36.736]  That pushes that coin over $20.
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:45.384]  In addition to this, we still have the British Sovereigns and Franks.
[02:49:45.424 --> 02:49:47.746]  They're at $2.75 for the British Sovereign.
[02:49:48.046 --> 02:49:49.488]  The Frank is at $2.22.
[02:49:49.808 --> 02:49:54.093]  I have a long array list of other coins that you can ask about if you're interested with the U.S.
[02:49:54.173 --> 02:49:56.395]  Eagles, the Maple Leafs, all the different things that we have.
[02:49:56.775 --> 02:49:59.378]  Matter of fact, we have a bunch of Pandas, which I can't believe.
[02:49:59.418 --> 02:50:00.299]  I usually never get those.
[02:50:00.379 --> 02:50:01.599]  Oh my gosh, what about buffaloes?
[02:50:01.619 --> 02:50:02.240]  Got any buffaloes?
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:06.261]  Just such a small amount, you can ask for them.
[02:50:06.281 --> 02:50:06.321]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:08.682 --> 02:50:19.686]  A few weeks ago I did an offer, and I had the internal sheet from Midas of what it was, where you guys were making, what, 60 cents per silver coin profit, and on gold it was like $5 a coin.
[02:50:19.746 --> 02:50:23.807]  I mean, folks, it's razor thin, and with the market up,
[02:50:25.097 --> 02:50:28.640]  Ted's losing money because he's not selling it at the higher amount.
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:32.643]  He's selling it from the lower amount he bought it, even though gold and silver's gone up.
[02:50:32.763 --> 02:50:37.486]  So there's hardly any markup on it, and that's when gold and silver was lower.
[02:50:37.767 --> 02:50:40.909]  This is really a great deal on the coins Ted just offered.
[02:50:40.949 --> 02:50:43.811]  So brokers will be there till midnight tonight.
[02:50:43.831 --> 02:50:46.113]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:46.133 --> 02:50:48.995]  Don't trust the bankers with all the stuff that's going on in the world.
[02:50:49.235 --> 02:50:52.978]  Get some liquid portable private insurance, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:55.722]  686-2237.
[02:50:56.604 --> 02:50:59.248]  And you heard him, he's got some of those great coins at great prices.
[02:50:59.529 --> 02:51:00.170]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:51:00.591 --> 02:51:01.733]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:51:02.093 --> 02:51:02.434]  You bet.
[02:51:02.474 --> 02:51:02.955]  Stay with us.
[02:51:02.995 --> 02:51:04.397]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:51:07.065 --> 02:51:08.326]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:08.366 --> 02:51:13.731]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:51:13.971 --> 02:51:18.595]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:51:18.975 --> 02:51:24.059]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:29.264]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:51:29.784 --> 02:51:31.666]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:51:32.085 --> 02:51:36.686]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:51:36.886 --> 02:51:37.786]  And here's the best part.
[02:51:38.006 --> 02:51:40.767]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:51:41.067 --> 02:51:44.368]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:51:44.688 --> 02:51:47.528]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:51:47.868 --> 02:51:49.769]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:51:50.089 --> 02:51:50.949]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:50.969 --> 02:51:51.169]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:51.189 --> 02:51:51.469]  Remember,
[02:51:59.827 --> 02:52:03.428]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:52:03.728 --> 02:52:06.168]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:52:07.669 --> 02:52:12.970]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:13.710 --> 02:52:19.051]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:19.572 --> 02:52:25.733]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:26.073 --> 02:52:27.915]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:28.055 --> 02:52:30.437]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:30.517 --> 02:52:41.465]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:43.707 --> 02:52:44.968]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:45.368 --> 02:52:46.770]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:47.230 --> 02:52:53.455]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:54.122 --> 02:53:01.899]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:03.542]  The Obama Deception.
[02:53:03.983 --> 02:53:05.165]  The people strike back!
[02:53:06.983 --> 02:53:10.246]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:53:10.426 --> 02:53:14.490]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:53:14.670 --> 02:53:26.121]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:53:26.341 --> 02:53:32.167]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:53:32.247 --> 02:53:32.587]  I think so.
[02:53:53.695 --> 02:53:54.756]  Alright, South Carolina, 9-11 Truth.
[02:54:22.668 --> 02:54:29.073]  January of this year, I talked to Governor Mark Sanford, and he really acts like a genuine person.
[02:54:29.093 --> 02:54:30.794]  I mean, you're watching his body language.
[02:54:30.835 --> 02:54:32.276]  It comes off as real truthful.
[02:54:32.756 --> 02:54:33.977]  I got invited to Bilderberg.
[02:54:34.037 --> 02:54:35.899]  It's really a bunch of powerless old men.
[02:54:35.919 --> 02:54:36.859]  They're kind of pathetic.
[02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:44.986]  David Rockefeller, yesterday's news, and then they're like, but Bernanke was there, and Paulson was there, and all these other guys.
[02:54:45.026 --> 02:54:48.649]  He's like, oh, and who's the other guy?
[02:54:51.616 --> 02:54:52.196]  You know, Geithner.
[02:54:52.877 --> 02:54:54.718]  And then he kind of acts a little deceptive.
[02:54:55.678 --> 02:54:59.540]  And I don't know, this Sanford guy's a very interesting character, I'll tell you that.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:06.924]  I've not even forgotten that he'd been at the 2008 Bilderberg that I covered in Chantilly, Virginia, that we actually cover in the Obama deception.
[02:55:06.944 --> 02:55:08.485]  That's the type of stuff that's in this film.
[02:55:09.025 --> 02:55:10.065]  I'd forgotten about that.
[02:55:10.085 --> 02:55:16.989]  So here's part of that clip, and then there's another clip where he gives this weird speech at a tea party about the all-seeing eye of God and all this stuff.
[02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:20.491]  But what's clear here is they
[02:55:21.673 --> 02:55:28.597]  Hyped up, where is he, where is he, to get a big national controversy going to then say it was his girlfriend.
[02:55:29.257 --> 02:55:30.898]  So they wanted to destroy him.
[02:55:31.298 --> 02:55:32.959]  The establishment wanted to do this.
[02:55:32.999 --> 02:55:35.480]  So, is it because he made fun of David Rockefeller?
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:36.461]  I don't know.
[02:55:36.521 --> 02:55:36.881]  Here it is.
[02:55:37.521 --> 02:55:42.763]  Back in early June, your name surfaced on the attendee list of the 2008 Bilderberg meeting that was held at the Westfield Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:55:43.463 --> 02:55:48.024]  Many of us find it strange that the entire three-day conference is completely blacked out of all mainstream news outlets every year.
[02:55:48.385 --> 02:55:50.265]  There are many citizens that are concerned about secrecy.
[02:55:50.985 --> 02:55:51.506]  Here's why.
[02:55:51.526 --> 02:55:58.548]  At the 2005 meeting in Munich, leaked talking points indicated that Bilderberg expected oil prices to surge over the next 12 months, which is exactly what happened.
[02:55:59.008 --> 02:56:05.453]  We also know that from the 2006 meeting in Ottawa, it came out ahead of time that the subprime mortgage bubble was going to burst, which is exactly what happened.
[02:56:05.933 --> 02:56:11.858]  My question for you is, what did you guys talk about up there, and in your opinion, Governor, why isn't the media allowed to report on the Bilderberg scandal?
[02:56:11.878 --> 02:56:12.158]  Sure.
[02:56:13.319 --> 02:56:14.039]  I don't know.
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:22.125]  I think there's a lot of intrigue and conspiracy theory on that one that really doesn't exist, at least based on my limited experience.
[02:56:22.145 --> 02:56:24.187]  I can't speak for what's happened there over the years.
[02:56:24.827 --> 02:56:26.269]  I was invited by a friend.
[02:56:27.229 --> 02:56:28.511]  He said you'll learn a lot.
[02:56:29.812 --> 02:56:38.701]  It was apparently originally set up after World War II to try and keep the link between Europe and America from the standpoint of keeping the conversation going.
[02:56:39.481 --> 02:56:40.903]  That's largely what went on.
[02:56:46.124 --> 02:56:54.981]  I mean, with all due respect to conversation, there were a bunch of guys who thought they were smart saying, hey, I think this or I think that, but I'm coming, I'm coming.
[02:56:55.782 --> 02:56:56.764]  And so I guess...
[02:56:58.376 --> 02:57:06.840]  I'd say, I never, regardless of who it's with, with the exception of maybe terrorists, I don't think conversation is a bad thing.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:09.761]  None of these people had the keys to power.
[02:57:09.801 --> 02:57:16.204]  They were all folks that, well that's not true, there were two Senators there and there were two Governors.
[02:57:16.224 --> 02:57:18.485]  One was a Republican Governor and one was a Democratic Governor.
[02:57:23.647 --> 02:57:30.245]  And so they talked about what was going to happen next in the relation with China, what was going to happen next in relation to Europe, what was going to happen next...
[02:57:31.918 --> 02:57:34.339]  And so I thought it was interesting.
[02:57:34.379 --> 02:57:37.441]  And so I understand that a lot of conservatives are very messed up.
[02:57:37.521 --> 02:57:39.842]  I called a number of friends and they called me and said, well, why'd you go?
[02:57:39.862 --> 02:57:40.942]  I said, well, look, a friend asked.
[02:57:40.982 --> 02:57:42.403]  I didn't know it was such a big deal.
[02:57:42.743 --> 02:57:43.523]  Yeah.
[02:57:44.003 --> 02:57:49.186]  If it was a hundred and some of the Hollywood top-notch stars, the media would be swarming that place.
[02:57:49.226 --> 02:57:49.586]  Right, right.
[02:57:49.686 --> 02:57:52.867]  But this is a hundred and some of the most powerful power brokers across the world.
[02:57:52.887 --> 02:57:53.668]  But they're really not.
[02:57:54.008 --> 02:57:55.528]  I just, with all due respect to the folks who are there.
[02:57:55.548 --> 02:57:56.609]  Folks like David Rockefeller and...
[02:57:56.989 --> 02:58:00.333]  David Rockefeller is a yesterday's news kind of guy.
[02:58:00.354 --> 02:58:01.956]  Henry Paulson was there, Ben Bernanke.
[02:58:01.976 --> 02:58:03.898]  I mean, that's some heavy hitters there.
[02:58:06.141 --> 02:58:07.383]  Maybe they were, they weren't there.
[02:58:07.483 --> 02:58:08.704]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:58:08.965 --> 02:58:09.806]  Are you sure about that?
[02:58:09.926 --> 02:58:10.967]  Oh yeah, I got the list right here.
[02:58:10.987 --> 02:58:12.509]  Let's stop right there, that's enough.
[02:58:14.571 --> 02:58:15.912]  And then he looks a little deceptive.
[02:58:16.132 --> 02:58:17.774]  But if he is a liar, he's an incredible liar.
[02:58:17.794 --> 02:58:22.298]  But see, they bring in politicians they want to kind of vet for just like five-hour meetings.
[02:58:22.638 --> 02:58:23.679]  But it goes on for three days.
[02:58:23.739 --> 02:58:28.303]  See, just because you've been an attendee doesn't mean you're part of the New World Order.
[02:58:28.323 --> 02:58:29.765]  But if you're a member, definitely.
[02:58:30.532 --> 02:58:31.833]  Now, I don't have time to play it.
[02:58:31.853 --> 02:58:32.453]  I'll play it tomorrow.
[02:58:33.093 --> 02:58:34.955]  We've got the clip up on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:34.975 --> 02:58:40.778]  This one right here, where he's talking about all seeing eyes of God and all this weird New World Order stuff.
[02:58:40.798 --> 02:58:42.959]  So, something's going on with this Sanford guy.
[02:58:42.999 --> 02:58:43.719]  We're watching it.
[02:58:43.739 --> 02:58:46.441]  Pre-transmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
