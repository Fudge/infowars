[00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:08.587]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.068]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:11.770]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:20.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.781]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:28.585]  We've reached the halfway point in this Wednesday.
[00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.013]  December 30, 2009 edition.
[00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:38.296]  We're simulcasting now the third and fourth hour live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:44.961]  I'm going to go over the Decade of Tyranny, an article written by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and myself at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:55.148]  In the last hour, I'm also going to spend a segment or so reading some quotes by George Washington.
[00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:00.807]  And talking about why King George III called him the greatest man in the world.
[00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.769]  Why did King George III call him the greatest man in the world?
[00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:09.771]  Because he turned down the power when he was offered kingship.
[00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:12.113]  In fact, the British wanted a king to deal with.
[00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:15.034]  They were just going to set him up as a new house of nobility.
[00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:16.235]  And he said no!
[00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:18.136]  And he didn't want to be president.
[00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:22.477]  Now, no one in history has acted and behaved like that.
[00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:24.779]  That's why our country had the best start ever.
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.804]  This great engine of liberty has been turned into an engine of tyranny.
[00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:34.068]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, former head of policy, the father of Reaganomics,
[00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.252]  Headed up the Treasury, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, best-selling author.
[00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:42.534]  The latest edition is out, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:45.156]  He joins us for the rest of the hour.
[00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:50.860]  We're going to get into the tyranny, the body scanners, the police state, then into the dollar, the economy.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.921]  His predictions again come true.
[00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:58.525]  He said a month ago here the dollar would go back up when the carry trade got reversed, but he said it would then go back down.
[00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.006]  We'll hear when that's going to happen.
[00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.387]  With us for the rest of the hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:05.009]  But first, he wanted to talk about hedges, Colin.
[00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:22.516]  Okay, Alex, I think the greatest threat that we face is the ongoing destruction of the United States Constitution and our civil liberties.
[00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:32.980]  They're now holding, you know, American citizens in indefinite detention, denying American citizens habeas corpus to protest
[00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:41.508]  And they're doing it without any evidence presented and without really any charges.
[00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.549]  They orchestrate the most blatantly false kinds of charges.
[00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.170]  Just take the case of this Fahad Hashmi.
[00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.111]  Now, he's an American citizen.
[00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:54.971]  I think he was in New York.
[00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:03.413]  He was a known Muslim activist in behalf of
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.121]  Yeah, it's almost three.
[00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:43.447]  I mean, the whole thing sounds far-fetched.
[00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:50.111]  I mean, why would somebody be trying to take socks and ponchos to the Taliban from New York?
[00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:54.516]  As if they can't buy it in Pakistan.
[00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:58.580]  A lot of the ponchos and socks that come here are from Pakistan, India, and China.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:09.890]  But on top of that, someone claims with no evidence, three or four deep, that maybe you let somebody stay with you who might have done something wrong and you disappear into a black hole as a U.S.
[00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.350]  citizen.
[00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.492]  That's exactly what happened.
[00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:14.134]  You summed it up good for me.
[00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:21.260]  I just finished reading the uncensored version of Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the first circle.
[00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:25.402]  Uh, about the Stalinist camps and legal system.
[00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:32.187]  And if you read that book, and then you read Chris Hedges' description of the American legal system, it's no different.
[00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:37.792]  What's happening to us is exactly what was ongoing in Stalinist Russia.
[00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:40.534]  People are just picked up and locked away.
[00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.735]  They just disappear.
[00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:42.916]  Well, stay there, sir.
[00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:44.057]  I want you to take your time.
[00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:47.439]  Let's get into Sholts and Neatson's first circle of hell.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.302]  Gulag Archipelago author.
[00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:52.465]  Nobel Prize winner.
[00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:54.150]  Somebody who actually deserved it.
[00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:57.500]  What, nine years in a gulag or was it eight years?
[00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:06.498]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:07.859]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:08.580]  It's very real.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.841]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:12.482]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:16.946]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:17.086 --> 00:05:19.448]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.622]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:04.563]  Number one.
[00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:08.005]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:08.845]  Number two.
[00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:13.688]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:14.488]  It's true.
[00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:19.331]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:20.172]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.452 --> 00:06:23.755]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:27.818]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:28.218]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.141]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.924]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.204 --> 00:06:35.405]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:39.909]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.893]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.193 --> 00:06:49.217]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.357 --> 00:06:50.918]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.138 --> 00:06:55.742]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.072 --> 00:07:04.673]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:13.156]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:13.876 --> 00:07:17.917]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:29.321]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:38.964]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:44.526]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:44.906 --> 00:07:52.069]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.130]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:05.112]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.492 --> 00:08:07.793]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:07.813 --> 00:08:15.195]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:21.856]  Then I'll do something that the collectivist and big government criminals will certainly hate, like nails on a chalkboard.
[00:08:22.256 --> 00:08:24.537]  We're going to talk about George Washington some today.
[00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:34.807]  And get into eco-spies with the new Apple iPhone application called EcoSnoop, spying on your neighbors and others.
[00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.211]  So that is coming up in the last hour.
[00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:41.998]  Okay, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a lot I want to talk about with the economy with him, top economist.
[00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:46.300]  Listed by many major publications in the top 10 economists in the world.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.561]  I want to obviously pick your brain going into the new year about your perspectives, your view on that.
[00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.843]  Your last prediction, very, very accurate, that you thought the dollar would go back up in late December, early January.
[00:08:57.523 --> 00:09:00.044]  As the carry trade that's been reversed back into the U.S.
[00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:01.964]  was activated, that has happened.
[00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:03.464]  So we want to pick your brain on that.
[00:09:03.504 --> 00:09:05.125]  But you were talking about the Kafkaesque
[00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:19.138]  Situation where American citizens are arrested and held, their lawyers are spied on, with no evidence, no charges, or no evidence to be charged, and this is the new precedent.
[00:09:19.178 --> 00:09:21.100]  You said you were reading one of Shultz and Eatson's books.
[00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:25.812]  And that it mirrors what's now happening.
[00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:31.534]  And I've talked to reporters from Eastern Europe, from Russia, and they say, look, we don't like communism and tyranny.
[00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:32.915]  And we know we're not perfect.
[00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:39.557]  But we were at the G20, and we saw women attacked with police dogs for coming out of stores with grocery sacks.
[00:09:39.897 --> 00:09:42.658]  We saw women knocked off their bikes at the university.
[00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:46.760]  We saw families hit with sound cannons in their neighborhoods.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.361]  We saw your police, and this is really bad.
[00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:52.282]  What happened to you?
[00:09:52.802 --> 00:09:55.043]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, break it down.
[00:09:56.483 --> 00:10:12.009]  Well, Alex, my book, Caring to Good Intentions, documents how we've lost the protective features in law over time because various single-interest groups have demonized some devil or the other.
[00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.269]  They wanted to get that devil at all costs.
[00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:19.451]  So if the law was in the way or civil liberty or the Constitution, they just overrode it.
[00:10:19.811 --> 00:10:20.892]  And then, of course, we had
[00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:45.319]  And we now have the situation we were talking about with this Fahd Hashmi, an American citizen, and he's being held in violation of all known American legal procedure of the Constitution, and nobody's doing anything about it.
[00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:51.561]  The bar associations are silent, the law schools are silent, the constitutional lawyers are
[00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:56.255]  As far as I can tell, not even the ACLU is on this case.
[00:10:56.315 --> 00:11:07.559]  So we now have a situation where American citizens have no more rights and are treated exactly as people in the Stalinist system were treated.
[00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:21.925]  And one of the points that Chris Hedges makes, he says that it's obvious that this treatment will not be reserved for the state of alleged terrorists or even for Muslims.
[00:11:22.884 --> 00:11:25.707]  Because it's going to be applied to everybody.
[00:11:25.927 --> 00:11:36.959]  Anyone who comes across as disruptive or subversive or a critic of the system or the government is going to be treated this way.
[00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:40.082]  And that's, of course, exactly what happened in Stalinist Russia.
[00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:44.447]  And Hedges says, he reports, that already
[00:11:46.286 --> 00:11:59.420]  Radical activist type in the environmental movement, the anti-globalization movement, the anti-nuclear movement, and to the sustainable agriculture movement.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:05.426]  These people are already being placed in the same special detention facilities
[00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:06.076]  What's
[00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.613]  Now, and this is the real operation, not the distraction that's Abu Ghraib.
[00:12:28.653 --> 00:12:38.900]  And we have the constitutional lawyer, Obama, caught red-handed expanding rendition and secret arrest in black sites all over Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.325]  And so, it's just so hard to believe this is going on, much less not getting more attention.
[00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:57.511]  And then we have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, when really this whole system's being set up for libertarians, conservatives, anti-Federal Reserve people, gun owners, returning vets.
[00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:05.535]  And so, just like Hitler, they're beta testing it on a group it's popular to strip the rights of, Muslims.
[00:13:05.936 --> 00:13:07.877]  But really, it's designed for everybody.
[00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:10.913]  Right, that's exactly it.
[00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:13.014]  People just don't realize that.
[00:13:13.094 --> 00:13:15.615]  You know, in Stalinist Russia, no one was safe.
[00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:18.797]  Not even the highest members of the party itself.
[00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:21.939]  Not even the heads of the secret police.
[00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:22.700]  No one was safe.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.481]  No one had any rights.
[00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:32.926]  Anybody could be picked up and just simply disappear and subjected to the most horrible treatment.
[00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:36.968]  I mean, it's just unbelievable how people were treated and are being treated.
[00:13:37.423 --> 00:13:42.886]  Well, I think this is the most serious thing that we face.
[00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:46.468]  And the fact that the courts accept it.
[00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:50.871]  For example, recently the Supreme Court rejected one of the Guantanamo torture cases.
[00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:56.254]  This was reported by Reuters earlier this month, around the middle of the month.
[00:13:57.195 --> 00:14:04.539]  And they were four British citizens who were tortured in Guantanamo, and the Supreme Court
[00:14:07.774 --> 00:14:08.814]  Appeal out of hand.
[00:14:09.275 --> 00:14:13.156]  There's another recent case that, you know, Andy Worthington is good.
[00:14:13.196 --> 00:14:14.737]  He reports a lot of these.
[00:14:14.797 --> 00:14:32.664]  He reported another one where a federal district judge, Thomas Hogan, just simply dismissed the case of a 28-year-old Yemeni who said he could be
[00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:37.294]  He's held indefinitely because of his alleged connection with Al Qaeda.
[00:14:37.394 --> 00:14:42.038]  So we see that the federal judges have acquiesced.
[00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:48.963]  Actually, in Nazi Germany, the judges stood up to the government a lot longer.
[00:14:49.003 --> 00:14:55.548]  In fact, they had to set up a second court system to bypass German law.
[00:14:55.948 --> 00:14:57.289]  Well, here we don't even have to do that.
[00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:59.651]  The federal judges just fall in with it.
[00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:02.129]  Apparently even the Supreme Court.
[00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:13.547]  So it looks like the rights of Americans are simply gone, and yet we still have all this verbiage and vocabulary of democracy, freedom,
[00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:14.301]  That's it.
[00:15:14.321 --> 00:15:14.782]  I'm afraid that's it.
[00:15:14.862 --> 00:15:16.703]  And the Americans just don't seem to catch on.
[00:15:16.763 --> 00:15:18.485]  They just don't seem to be able to
[00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:47.208]  Well, that's like CPS and the family courts taking people's children without due process.
[00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:48.748]  They just do what they want.
[00:15:48.768 --> 00:15:49.769]  That's right.
[00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:57.372]  I don't think there are any people anywhere that are less protected than the American people.
[00:15:57.492 --> 00:16:01.294]  The law no longer protects an American in his own country.
[00:16:02.234 --> 00:16:08.117]  And I think that, you know, we try to make a big deal out of human rights in China.
[00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:11.341]  Well, I actually think they get better treatment than we do.
[00:16:11.562 --> 00:16:14.106]  They certainly have a much smaller percentage of their people...
[00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:16.307]  Well, I'm no fan of Iran.
[00:16:16.327 --> 00:16:17.787]  I mean, most government becomes corrupt.
[00:16:17.928 --> 00:16:19.068]  The Founding Fathers knew that.
[00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.209]  But they're not taking over my life.
[00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:24.011]  And it shows police bumping people with cars.
[00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:30.994]  I was in New York in 2004 and watched the police running over people with cars, horses, and mopeds.
[00:16:31.535 --> 00:16:33.736]  You know, they kill people at the Red Sox game.
[00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:35.857]  They kill people all the time.
[00:16:36.137 --> 00:16:41.300]  And Iran's killed a few people, and I think it's wrong, but they are CIA-funded shooting police.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.886]  But how can our media schizophrenically say Iran bad, but America good when they do it?
[00:16:49.428 --> 00:16:54.613]  I guess it's just the hubris and stupidity of our population.
[00:16:56.254 --> 00:17:01.319]  They're like the people in 1984, you know, they're all big brothers and tell them something.
[00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:04.979]  Well that's another issue.
[00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:05.980]  You've read Sholts and Eatson.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.800]  You've studied history.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.141]  You've written and edited for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:22.147]  When you read Sholts and Eatson's accounts and other accounts of people in true tyranny, and then you see it all manifesting and growing, they've set the precedent for that same level of Soviet tyranny.
[00:17:22.527 --> 00:17:23.687]  Now they're implementing it.
[00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:26.609]  It's got to be hard for you to watch.
[00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:27.869]  I know it's hard for me to watch.
[00:17:27.889 --> 00:17:29.490]  Do you see any way of stopping it?
[00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.231]  And can you draw some more parallels of what Sholts and Eatson saw?
[00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:38.050]  Well, you know, I don't think there's any way of stopping it.
[00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:46.395]  It eventually stopped in the Soviet Union because the highest members of the party realized they weren't safe either.
[00:17:47.276 --> 00:18:02.424]  And so when Stalin died, or was put down perhaps, Khrushchev in 1956 gave that secret speech in which he denounced Stalin to the Communist Party, to the Central Committee.
[00:18:04.634 --> 00:18:13.582]  And he did that because no one felt safe, and they had to get rid of that kind of legacy rather than have it continue.
[00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:25.673]  And then, of course, Khrushchev allowed Solzhenitsyn to publish that book, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, which was the story of the labor camps, the death camps.
[00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:31.458]  And so things started loosening up just in order to protect themselves.
[00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:40.697]  But it took a long time to reach that point, and so I think no American will be safe.
[00:18:40.757 --> 00:18:57.362]  And it won't matter whether you're a critic or not, because anybody could get picked up, or somebody may want your property, or your girlfriend, or your wife, or they may not like you, and so all they've got to do is make a charge.
[00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.633]  And by the way, Dr. Roberts, that's not your opinion.
[00:19:01.713 --> 00:19:04.875]  We know how tyrannies work from Rome to today.
[00:19:05.716 --> 00:19:10.599]  Most of the time, the machine just wants to beat people up, rob them, rape them, take their property.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.063]  Most of the people that are being abused will have nothing to do with the real boogeymen.
[00:19:15.903 --> 00:19:16.364]  Exactly.
[00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:19.526]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:19:20.287 --> 00:19:26.171]  And it reaches the point where the Secret Police and the Service Union, in order to prove their loyalty,
[00:19:27.182 --> 00:19:31.244]  Stay there, let's talk about this more because I have an article where a guy
[00:19:50.575 --> 00:19:53.518]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:19:53.538 --> 00:19:55.660]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.003]  No more mortgage can change your life.
[00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:08.093]  With no more mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:20:08.113 --> 00:20:09.435]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.811]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:20:23.852 --> 00:20:26.294]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[00:20:26.354 --> 00:20:29.997]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[00:20:30.238 --> 00:20:32.359]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:48.130]  Call the number.

[00:20:59.802 --> 00:21:07.264]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:21:07.544 --> 00:21:13.326]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:16.306]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:22.508]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:32.311]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:34.352]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:21:34.632 --> 00:21:36.032]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:21:36.372 --> 00:21:38.633]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:21:38.913 --> 00:21:43.255]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:47.016]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:21:47.336 --> 00:21:49.957]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:21:50.457 --> 00:21:51.878]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:54.479]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:21:59.358 --> 00:22:03.221]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible, federal deficit spending?
[00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:07.604]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[00:22:07.724 --> 00:22:09.105]  You get less for your money.
[00:22:09.305 --> 00:22:15.169]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.

[00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:51.446]  Freeze Dry Guy.

[00:24:07.777 --> 00:24:09.399]  One day we will all be terrorists.
[00:24:09.439 --> 00:24:19.628]  Coming up in the next segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, we're going to get into the economy, and I'm going to open the phones up specifically for our guests with questions on the economy.
[00:24:19.648 --> 00:24:29.937]  1-800-259-9231 as we close out the year with our regular guests, the great minds that agree to come on this show and share their
[00:24:31.118 --> 00:24:33.619]  Researched knowledge with us 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:33.799 --> 00:24:49.303]  Okay, dr. Roberts Again, I mean we know what real hardcore tyranny is and the Soviets the Nazis They always had great excuses for why they were secretly arresting people and torturing them and now they're gonna put
[00:24:51.226 --> 00:24:55.450]  Different people on trial who've been held four, five, six, seven years in some cases.
[00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:59.855]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, they admittedly threatened his family, admittedly tortured him.
[00:25:00.215 --> 00:25:01.417]  Now that's admissible.
[00:25:01.697 --> 00:25:07.163]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till three and a half, four years after he was arrested.
[00:25:07.663 --> 00:25:13.529]  He might as well have confessed to killing Jesus or shooting at the Ford Theater.
[00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:14.470]  Well,
[00:25:44.332 --> 00:25:44.872]  They're evil.
[00:25:45.953 --> 00:25:58.258]  And as I said, and I think it's clear, there's no difference today in the legal rights of an American citizen and a Soviet citizen under Joseph Stalin.
[00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:00.779]  Neither one has any rights.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.882]  All your rights can be turned off simply by the government using a few words.
[00:26:08.463 --> 00:26:10.203]  They can say you're something you're not.
[00:26:11.384 --> 00:26:13.725]  In fact, they don't even really need to do that anymore.
[00:26:15.484 --> 00:26:18.446]  And so, we have no right, there's no doubt about it.
[00:26:18.546 --> 00:26:25.172]  And to change the subject before we get to the economy, really quick, did you see that report from the pilots for 9-11 Truth?
[00:26:25.892 --> 00:26:43.226]  That Flight 77, they got the information from the Air Transportation Safety Administration, whatever it's called, that the black box that watches the pilot's door every four seconds reports that it was never opened during the whole 90 minutes.
[00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:45.984]  Well, the alleged hijacking.
[00:26:46.024 --> 00:26:52.928]  You know, the official story is that the hijackers forced the pilot out to the back of the plane and all that.
[00:26:52.948 --> 00:26:55.430]  This is the one that allegedly ran into the Pentagon.
[00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.513]  And now there's a black box that says that the door was never opened.
[00:27:00.553 --> 00:27:01.954]  So how did they take over the plane?
[00:27:02.274 --> 00:27:09.819]  And the pilot of that plane was the guy a year before taking part in drills of flying a hijacked jet into the Pentagon.
[00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:18.684]  Then his daughter spoke up and she got firebombed to death in New Jersey, and then the plane did maneuvers that were physically impossible for the airframe.
[00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:19.744]  Yes, I'm aware of that.
[00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:24.947]  We need to in fact get the Pilots for 9-11 Truth on about that issue.
[00:27:24.987 --> 00:27:29.430]  That's confirmed they got that, but I guess frauds don't matter, do they?
[00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:33.632]  No one pays any attention.
[00:27:33.812 --> 00:27:34.373]  It's amazing.
[00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:38.378]  You would think that Congress would be saying, how could this be?
[00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:40.640]  And we got to have this investigated.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.162]  Or somebody, you'd think, would say, how could this be?
[00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.085]  But nothing happened.
[00:27:47.185 --> 00:27:55.191]  So it's more evidence that essentially the situation in the United States is out of control.
[00:27:56.552 --> 00:27:57.273]  There are no rights.
[00:27:58.434 --> 00:27:59.194]  They do what they want.
[00:27:59.234 --> 00:28:01.876]  They can say whatever they want, no matter how absurd.
[00:28:02.437 --> 00:28:04.098]  People don't seem to be able to
[00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:16.348]  And the establishment is geared up wanting a 1776 response, with NORTHCOM wanting to have a war with the people.
[00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:28.134]  But I think, more and more, it's clear that we have to try to get the country back peacefully, but that we can't be drug off to FEMA camps.
[00:28:29.354 --> 00:28:34.577]  I mean, George Washington said, better the entire continent be drenched in blood than we live as slaves.
[00:28:36.547 --> 00:28:39.869]  Well, I agree with that, but I don't know what the American people will do.
[00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:45.153]  They probably won't catch on until it's too late.
[00:28:47.054 --> 00:28:50.176]  The Soviets didn't catch on until nothing could be done.
[00:28:52.017 --> 00:28:54.319]  So maybe the economy's collapse will save us.
[00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:55.139]  Who knows?
[00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:58.281]  Maybe the dollar's collapse might save us.
[00:28:59.522 --> 00:29:03.745]  If the crowd in Washington loses its economic
[00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:15.045]  Well, I know I'm evil for quoting George Washington.
[00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:20.368]  I have the FEMA training manuals and footage of the Founding Fathers being demonized to Kansas City Police by FEMA.
[00:29:21.148 --> 00:29:24.670]  And I'm not calling for this, folks, but Washington said, I don't want violence.
[00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:32.154]  But he said, you know, it seems the only thing a virtuous man can do is say that when faced with this,
[00:29:33.936 --> 00:29:35.838]  The only decision you have is to fight.
[00:29:36.618 --> 00:29:38.480]  And we are fighting to warn the people.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.981]  We may be able to turn this around.
[00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:42.223]  We had victory over the Copenhagen fraud.
[00:29:42.523 --> 00:29:46.526]  We'll talk about the economy with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the other side.
[00:29:46.546 --> 00:29:47.427]  Very honored to have him.
[00:29:47.847 --> 00:29:48.828]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.329 --> 00:29:51.250]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.332]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.272 --> 00:29:56.955]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:04.503]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:04.863 --> 00:30:07.866]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:12.891]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:19.157]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:19.297 --> 00:30:21.540]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.481]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:24.202]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.343]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:40.973 --> 00:30:44.898]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:47.922]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:31:00.063 --> 00:31:02.665]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:08.048]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:10.149]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:10.449 --> 00:31:15.272]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.453 --> 00:31:16.413]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.633 --> 00:31:17.394]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.774 --> 00:31:19.355]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.655 --> 00:31:20.476]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.716 --> 00:31:22.797]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.917 --> 00:31:24.038]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.258 --> 00:31:25.579]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:30.861]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:34.243]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.623 --> 00:31:38.125]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.445 --> 00:31:39.445]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.685 --> 00:31:40.286]  We don't know.
[00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:41.486]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.686 --> 00:31:42.407]  All you can get.
[00:31:42.607 --> 00:31:43.307]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.707 --> 00:31:43.948]  I think.

[00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.829]  You're looking
[00:33:12.725 --> 00:33:25.055]  At a satisfying fellow Unhappy Well, I should say now If somebody told me that she cheated No, I wouldn't believe them
[00:33:43.865 --> 00:33:47.288]  Going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who is with us.
[00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.211]  There is so much happening.
[00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:19.298]  I mean, the hedge of liberty and freedom, the hedge of the republic, it created all this wealth.
[00:34:19.318 --> 00:34:26.547]  I mean, Mexico has triple the resources we do, but they're in absolute poverty because their elite uses poverty as a tool of control.
[00:34:27.268 --> 00:34:28.690]  North Korea, the same thing.
[00:34:29.591 --> 00:34:33.773]  And I just grieve for this nation, but we are so decadent.
[00:34:34.353 --> 00:34:47.218]  We know those cycles of people go through adversity, they then stand up against it, they get liberty, then they get plenty and success, and then decadence sets in and rot sets in, and then the takeover happens.
[00:34:47.238 --> 00:34:48.919]  But I do see people waking up.
[00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:52.241]  I just don't think they've woken up to just how bad it is.
[00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:55.022]  Now, we did have a victory against the cap and trade.
[00:34:55.962 --> 00:34:58.363]  Obama's approval rating is dropping like a rock.
[00:34:58.904 --> 00:35:03.886]  And I mean, do you see anything positive out there turning the corner on this?
[00:35:04.166 --> 00:35:12.951]  Or are you just so shocked by the fact that there's no longer any habeas corpus that you fear for our future?
[00:35:14.192 --> 00:35:17.673]  Yeah, I fear for the future because we have no legal protection.
[00:35:18.594 --> 00:35:23.076]  And the economy will resume its downward spiral in 2010.
[00:35:25.702 --> 00:35:38.893]  I think we've just started the economic turmoil, and so it's going to get much worse, and people are unprotected.
[00:35:38.913 --> 00:35:40.435]  They've got no savings.
[00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:42.116]  They're losing their homes.
[00:35:42.256 --> 00:35:43.137]  There's no jobs.
[00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:47.761]  There's no health care, and they're not going to get any.
[00:35:51.394 --> 00:35:59.461]  If the dollar itself, at some point the dollar is going to be abandoned as the world reserve currency.
[00:36:00.502 --> 00:36:04.345]  And I don't know when, but at some point it's going to happen.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:08.408]  And when it does, we won't be able to pay for our imports.
[00:36:09.769 --> 00:36:20.318]  And since we're heavily dependent on imports, not just oil and gasoline and energy, but manufactured goods and advanced technology,
[00:36:21.133 --> 00:36:28.656]  It's going to cause amazing disruption, particularly in food delivery to grocery stores.
[00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:36.018]  They'll become erratic, and so most likely rationing systems will go in.
[00:36:37.819 --> 00:36:41.320]  It's a very dismal outlook.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:48.222]  It's receiving no attention because the Washington banks, or at least it's telling people that we now have a recovery.
[00:36:51.081 --> 00:36:53.622]  It may be a slow recovery, but it's a recovery.
[00:36:56.203 --> 00:37:02.586]  So it may be what saves us from a police state, or it may bring it on.
[00:37:03.086 --> 00:37:17.573]  You can't tell what the political response to such tremendous economic hardship will be, whether it'll be liberating or whether it'll just bring the
[00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:36.675]  Well, we talk about it day in and day out.
[00:37:36.715 --> 00:37:39.717]  We try to rally the people to wake up and become aware of what's happening.
[00:37:40.518 --> 00:37:45.382]  And I guess the best thing we can do
[00:37:48.666 --> 00:38:14.578]  The best thing we can do, while we're getting Dr. Paul Craig Roberts back, our phone system cut out, the best we can do is just try to warn the people, try to warn the police and military how they're being brainwashed, how they're being incrementally twisted, and hope that, just like in the Soviet Union, after Stalin and Lenin had killed 50 million people, that it stops.
[00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:17.499]  Maybe we can stop it before it gets to that point.
[00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:27.607]  Because FEMA and Homeland Security folks, all they talk about is gun owners and veterans and conservatives and how they want to lock your butts up and how it should be illegal.
[00:38:30.448 --> 00:38:32.508]  Okay, yes, we've got Dr. Roberts back now.
[00:38:32.528 --> 00:38:35.229]  We're going to go ahead and pot him up on air.
[00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:39.149]  Okay, continuing, sir, your phone got cut off there.
[00:38:39.169 --> 00:38:40.750]  Sure it did.
[00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.230]  No, no, finishing up your point.
[00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.491]  Okay, well, the point is that other currencies are in trouble, too.
[00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:47.991]  For example, the British Pound.
[00:38:50.064 --> 00:38:57.168]  Probably the Euro, because it has so many marginal countries that are part of that, they can't take the pressure.
[00:38:57.348 --> 00:39:01.550]  You know, you've got Greece and Ireland that are having trouble.
[00:39:03.451 --> 00:39:10.614]  So many other currencies are in trouble, that this can sustain the dollar beyond what one might expect.
[00:39:12.535 --> 00:39:17.858]  The British pound could run into trouble first, and of course then that would strengthen the dollar.
[00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:25.296]  And the euro, as I said, may have trouble because of the weaker countries that are part of that system.
[00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.818]  And then that would strengthen the dollar.
[00:39:27.858 --> 00:39:33.923]  So the dollar could look like it was back being the almighty currency again.
[00:39:35.184 --> 00:39:42.670]  But nothing fundamental would have changed in terms of the dollar's own condition.
[00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:47.013]  It's still being assaulted by the massive
[00:39:47.825 --> 00:39:51.566]  Uh, trade deficits and by the massive budget deficit.
[00:39:52.886 --> 00:40:03.369]  And as these budget deficits can't be financed except by creating new money, there is at some point the danger of a real hyperinflation.
[00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:15.952]  Now, as I said, you can't put a timeline on any of that, but I suspect the worsening economy we will see in this coming year.
[00:40:18.286 --> 00:40:29.670]  And depending on which currency gets in trouble first, if it's the British Pound and the Euro, then the dollar has a longer run to go before it bites the dust as well.
[00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.611]  Those things are just unknown.
[00:40:33.111 --> 00:40:41.974]  So this is a derivatives debt, slave goods from the third world, black hole that is inescapable.
[00:40:42.314 --> 00:40:43.955]  The question is, what
[00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:47.558]  Currencies will be pulled completely in first.
[00:40:47.578 --> 00:41:00.128]  I mean, I remember a couple months ago and then again a month ago on air, you said, I look for the dollar in the next month or two to go back up because other currencies are in trouble and because there's this carry trade no longer going on in Japan and Europe.
[00:41:00.588 --> 00:41:02.330]  It's now coming back into the United States.
[00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.731]  Maybe you can explain that to people.
[00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:05.792]  And then when do you see
[00:41:06.713 --> 00:41:09.874]  The dollar beginning to not die, but start going back down.
[00:41:09.894 --> 00:41:13.696]  Because just two months ago, they were saying, the dollar's dead, we gotta get its replacement.
[00:41:14.196 --> 00:41:16.797]  Now they're saying, you know, well the dollar's back up for now.
[00:41:17.778 --> 00:41:18.598]  And so what happens?
[00:41:18.618 --> 00:41:21.339]  I mean, we have Main Street imploding.
[00:41:21.619 --> 00:41:23.320]  The worst Christmas since 79.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.161]  We have debt exploding.
[00:41:26.601 --> 00:41:31.323]  All these other real numbers coming in, showing the real economy is in terminal breakdown.
[00:41:31.663 --> 00:41:32.604]  Meanwhile, the banks
[00:41:33.564 --> 00:41:53.473]  Bloomberg's reporting in the bank re-regulation plan got four trillion extra in goodies that are hidden in there so it just appears that they know the whole world economy is going down and that they just plan to be sitting on top of it with paramilitary national security forces over the rubble in the end.
[00:41:53.493 --> 00:41:56.895]  Yes, could be something like that.
[00:41:58.502 --> 00:42:03.343]  The dollar has strengthened because of the belief that we have a recovery.
[00:42:03.483 --> 00:42:07.764]  So, foreign money is coming in to the stock market.
[00:42:08.524 --> 00:42:10.284]  So, this supports the dollar.
[00:42:10.364 --> 00:42:14.325]  They changed their currency for dollars to buy into the stocks.
[00:42:16.086 --> 00:42:21.567]  This is one of the reasons that the dollar has perked up a bit.
[00:42:22.607 --> 00:42:26.668]  And, of course, the banking situation remains.
[00:42:27.816 --> 00:42:30.398]  Both here and abroad remains really unknown.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:52.274]  And the fact that the Americans have simply exported such a large percentage of what were middle class jobs, that it means we're going to have a high level of unemployment permanently.
[00:42:53.234 --> 00:42:56.637]  There's no way, there's no jobs for these people to come back to.
[00:42:58.886 --> 00:43:02.348]  So it's the new term in the lexicon, the jobless recovery.
[00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:05.729]  Uh, well, it's not going to be a recovery.
[00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.971]  No, I know, but that's like saying a dead man is alive.
[00:43:09.171 --> 00:43:09.791]  Yeah, right.
[00:43:10.312 --> 00:43:11.092]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:43:11.132 --> 00:43:11.332]  Yeah.
[00:43:11.572 --> 00:43:12.813]  Yeah, the media is saying that.
[00:43:13.133 --> 00:43:13.333]  Right.
[00:43:13.914 --> 00:43:18.496]  Well, yeah, it's a nonsensical term, uh, to have a jobless recovery.
[00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:26.820]  Now, the government also can break the statistics within a certain range if they can't, they can't
[00:43:27.423 --> 00:43:37.250]  Do it tremendously, but within a certain range they can break the statistics, and one of the ways they produce real economic growth is by understating the inflation.
[00:43:39.431 --> 00:43:50.159]  So, you know, if they can make the inflation seem like it's not really inflation, then what is inflation can be called economic growth.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.200]  So they can do that.
[00:43:53.362 --> 00:43:57.945]  And if unemployment's really at 21%, if they say it's 10, that can cook the numbers.
[00:43:58.225 --> 00:44:01.667]  Where really the economy is still declining, they're just cooking the numbers.
[00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:03.047]  That's right.
[00:44:04.068 --> 00:44:10.772]  They've changed the way they count the unemployed, so that about half of them no longer count it.
[00:44:12.152 --> 00:44:14.954]  But actually, they do have a second measure they use.
[00:44:15.074 --> 00:44:16.335]  It's just never reported.
[00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:21.097]  And that second measure does count a lot of the
[00:44:22.697 --> 00:44:23.878]  Discouraged workers.
[00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:32.642]  And I think, according to that second measure from the BLS, it measures 16 or 17% unemployment.
[00:44:34.523 --> 00:44:44.068]  And so, even the government will admit that the 10% is just sort of a headline number they report, but that their own real number is 16 or 17%.
[00:44:46.169 --> 00:44:49.911]  But if you go ahead and adjust all the figures back to how they used to count it, it is 21%.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.864]  And these jobs are gone.
[00:44:56.825 --> 00:45:02.391]  If you look at Detroit or Michigan, it looks like a bombed out area.
[00:45:02.411 --> 00:45:05.634]  The industry is gone.
[00:45:05.654 --> 00:45:06.976]  The tax base is gone.
[00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:17.931]  Well, look at Detroit, and many areas of Michigan have right at 50% unemployment, and the government just keeps raising taxes, more police, more checkpoints, more fines.
[00:45:18.111 --> 00:45:19.012]  I live in Texas.
[00:45:19.592 --> 00:45:22.835]  In the last two years, they've announced five new business taxes.
[00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:27.718]  Every few months, some new bureaucrat shows up and says, you didn't know about this new tax, buddy?
[00:45:28.098 --> 00:45:30.079]  And they're arrogant, and they're bossy.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:36.664]  And I mean, and I'm getting to the point of like, I want to keep getting the word out, but if I was just a regular business person,
[00:45:38.164 --> 00:45:40.725]  You know, why would I want to employ a bunch of people?
[00:45:40.785 --> 00:45:46.346]  Why would I want to take a bunch of risks so some parasite can come to my door and boss me around?
[00:45:47.167 --> 00:45:47.407]  Right.
[00:45:48.147 --> 00:45:50.568]  Like you said earlier, Alex, we're slaves.
[00:45:52.908 --> 00:45:53.488]  We're slaves.
[00:45:53.528 --> 00:45:55.049]  We don't own our own labor.
[00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:57.850]  We have no legal protection.
[00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:06.692]  We can't, you know, you can't get the truth from what used to be reliable
[00:46:07.475 --> 00:46:09.156]  Television and print media.
[00:46:12.317 --> 00:46:20.602]  It's just not a situation that bodes any promise for anything good.
[00:46:20.842 --> 00:46:23.083]  There's no way you can come out of this.
[00:46:24.464 --> 00:46:26.064]  You're fed disinformation.
[00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:30.447]  Your rights are taken away.
[00:46:30.467 --> 00:46:32.968]  Your jobs are taken away.
[00:46:35.498 --> 00:46:40.505]  And then they said they're going to give you health care by making you buy a private insurance policy.
[00:46:42.788 --> 00:46:44.931]  And that's the whole problem then.
[00:46:45.529 --> 00:46:57.681]  And then even the socialists, even Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich and all these big liberals, they read the bill and said, my God, this is a rip-off to banks and insurance companies and liability protection for big pharma.
[00:46:58.942 --> 00:47:07.991]  They raise the taxes, threaten to throw you in jail, make you buy insurance, penalize people that got fancy plans with a 40% tax.
[00:47:09.673 --> 00:47:13.895]  There's at least 19 new taxes in the bill, AP has reported.
[00:47:13.915 --> 00:47:19.298]  The Democrats don't want it, the conservatives don't want it, but the establishment wants it.
[00:47:19.318 --> 00:47:21.480]  I mean, this is a rogue government.
[00:47:23.521 --> 00:47:25.582]  It's a government of special interests.
[00:47:27.003 --> 00:47:33.106]  There are a few well-organized powerful special interests and they control the government.
[00:47:33.908 --> 00:47:34.828]  And we know who they are.
[00:47:34.868 --> 00:47:35.929]  We know it's AIPAC.
[00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:38.170]  It's the financial lobby.
[00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.851]  It's the military security lobby.
[00:47:39.931 --> 00:47:43.713]  It's the private insurance lobby.
[00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:45.273]  And it's the tort lawyers.
[00:47:46.854 --> 00:47:50.576]  And they control the government.
[00:47:50.636 --> 00:47:57.319]  And the government does what they say because they provide the campaign contributions that get the members elected.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:03.202]  And that's why it's hard for the people to take the government back because
[00:48:04.454 --> 00:48:10.395]  The government is dependent on a handful of organized special interests for the campaign contributions.
[00:48:10.655 --> 00:48:16.256]  So we went wrong when we allowed that type of campaign finance.
[00:48:17.036 --> 00:48:21.757]  And it was done under the guise of the First Amendment right.
[00:48:23.477 --> 00:48:25.398]  But, of course, it destroyed all the rights.
[00:48:26.898 --> 00:48:32.639]  And I don't see how you can change it, because now the members are
[00:48:33.815 --> 00:48:43.283]  And it's deeper than that, though.
[00:48:43.303 --> 00:48:48.928]  There's also a lot of blackmail going on, and it's come out the MI6 spies on the parliament and blackmails them.
[00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:53.653]  I mean, this is just... this is just a black hole of corruption.
[00:48:54.278 --> 00:49:00.723]  Well, that's the reason, in my view, that Bush was violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:49:00.783 --> 00:49:04.386]  He was spying on people without warrants because it had nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:49:04.987 --> 00:49:08.429]  He was getting the goods on the Democrats so they couldn't oppose his program.
[00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:14.294]  Yeah, you said that here about three years ago, and what that came out earlier this year, that congressmen were spied on.
[00:49:14.614 --> 00:49:14.854]  Yeah.
[00:49:15.395 --> 00:49:21.740]  Well, I said it when we first learned that he was violating the Foreign Intelligence
[00:49:23.057 --> 00:49:27.619]  No reason to violate it, because it doesn't prevent you from spying.
[00:49:27.659 --> 00:49:30.441]  It just makes you go to a court to get a warrant.
[00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:34.203]  But if you're trying, it means you have to have a real reason.
[00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:39.107]  So you can't go to the court and say, well, I want to spy on the Democrats so I can blackmail them.
[00:49:40.768 --> 00:49:42.889]  And so that's why they were spying without warrant.
[00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:44.870]  And they got away with it.
[00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.031]  And it's a felony.
[00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:48.752]  And nothing happened.
[00:49:51.342 --> 00:49:55.425]  So how does this emboldening end where they set the precedent?
[00:49:55.465 --> 00:50:00.268]  We spy illegally, we arrest illegally, we torture, we put the tortured on trial.
[00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:03.751]  I mean, what comes next?
[00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:05.072]  It just gets worse and worse.
[00:50:05.852 --> 00:50:06.993]  It's a Stalinist state.
[00:50:07.954 --> 00:50:09.475]  And it's all due to 9-11.
[00:50:10.796 --> 00:50:15.859]  Which many people, as you know, yourself included, think was an inside job.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.062]  So they used something to destroy
[00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:22.839]  Our rights and our prospects.
[00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:27.723]  So they could be secure in robbing everything?
[00:50:28.644 --> 00:50:29.344]  I think so.
[00:50:30.605 --> 00:50:31.065]  You know what?
[00:50:31.226 --> 00:50:32.126]  It's evil.
[00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:37.150]  And this, I mean, evil is not always explicable.
[00:50:37.891 --> 00:50:38.331]  Why?
[00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:40.573]  Why do this?
[00:50:41.653 --> 00:50:42.114]  Power.
[00:50:43.054 --> 00:50:43.735]  Power.
[00:50:43.835 --> 00:50:44.295]  Power.
[00:50:44.996 --> 00:50:47.218]  Power is the horse ridden by evil.
[00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:51.887]  Stay there, Dr. Roberts.
[00:50:52.568 --> 00:50:53.289]  Final segment.
[00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:55.251]  We've got a break for commercial.

[00:52:08.228 --> 00:52:09.651]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.033]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.773 --> 00:52:19.198]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.399 --> 00:52:24.443]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:24.463 --> 00:52:34.593]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:34.693 --> 00:52:35.354]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:35.554 --> 00:52:36.014]  Bernanke?
[00:52:36.054 --> 00:52:36.795]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:37.035 --> 00:52:38.376]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:38.636 --> 00:52:40.918]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.098 --> 00:52:42.939]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.219 --> 00:52:47.983]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:54:14.237 --> 00:54:33.412]  I've got George Jones, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts with us.
[00:54:33.432 --> 00:54:35.254]  He got cut off by that satellite break.
[00:54:35.774 --> 00:54:39.977]  Dr. Roberts, finishing your point in the five minutes we've got left going into the new year.
[00:54:40.998 --> 00:54:42.920]  Any other issues that you think are important?
[00:54:44.076 --> 00:54:56.059]  Well, Alex, you were talking about blackmail, and I would like to ask you, did you see that Wayne Madsen report that the CIA had been involved in child sex trade since 1978?
[00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:57.700]  Yes.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:10.463]  And that when these government, American government big shots and congressmen would travel to Bangkok, the CIA would provide them with children for sexual purposes.
[00:55:11.405 --> 00:55:14.648]  And then had complete blackmail power over them.
[00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:32.022]  Just looking at that report, which I read in the Rock Creek Press, apparently an alternative newspaper that's just really amazing in the things that it covers, I was thinking, how could the congressman be that dumb?
[00:55:32.122 --> 00:55:38.448]  I mean, how could people be this stupid to
[00:55:39.609 --> 00:55:43.251]  They don't realize they're setting themselves up for blackmail?
[00:55:43.291 --> 00:55:49.955]  I mean... From what I've been told by talking to some... You've been in higher levels of the system than I have, sir.
[00:55:49.995 --> 00:55:50.856]  I haven't been in government.
[00:55:50.896 --> 00:55:52.957]  You've been the head of policy at the Treasury.
[00:55:53.537 --> 00:55:59.241]  But at the higher levels of this corruption, you don't get into the guild without wallowing in the muck.
[00:55:59.361 --> 00:56:00.642]  It is an initiation.
[00:56:00.922 --> 00:56:07.846]  And so they knowingly go to these events, and they knowingly know they're being set up to prove themselves.
[00:56:09.486 --> 00:56:09.886]  I think.
[00:56:10.286 --> 00:56:13.227]  Like, joining one of those L.A.
[00:56:13.267 --> 00:56:15.388]  gangs, you have to kill somebody first or something.
[00:56:15.888 --> 00:56:16.528]  Exactly!
[00:56:16.568 --> 00:56:17.869]  That's exactly what I was told.
[00:56:18.409 --> 00:56:22.630]  In fact, that was exactly the way it was explained to me by a L.A.P.D.
[00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:24.851]  former famous detective, retired.
[00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:27.852]  It's funny you said L.A.
[00:56:27.872 --> 00:56:29.333]  because you said it's just like these L.A.
[00:56:29.373 --> 00:56:29.733]  gangs.
[00:56:30.073 --> 00:56:35.777]  That's what the really powerful corrupt politicians do at state, county, city, and federal.
[00:56:36.037 --> 00:56:40.580]  And then they all work in international crime guilds where it's not all organized.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.561]  It's just, oh, you can trust this person.
[00:56:42.602 --> 00:56:43.102]  He's dirty.
[00:56:44.263 --> 00:56:44.523]  Uh-huh.
[00:56:45.343 --> 00:56:47.245]  Yeah.
[00:56:47.405 --> 00:56:52.168]  And that's, of course, what's happening to our own police.
[00:56:53.729 --> 00:56:54.730]  Even local police.
[00:56:56.488 --> 00:57:00.732]  Once the corrupt element comes in, you either have to join up with it or they drive you out.
[00:57:02.033 --> 00:57:08.438]  I've had a lot of police officers, former police officers, write to me and email and tell me that.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:20.208]  So, it looks like we now have a system in which there's no ethics in it at any place, at any point.
[00:57:29.008 --> 00:57:29.789]  I agree with you.
[00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:31.369]  We are beyond redemption.
[00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:33.850]  50-something million abortions, you name it.
[00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:37.392]  But the question is, what are we going to build on the ashes of this?
[00:57:37.452 --> 00:57:38.873]  Something worse or something better?
[00:57:39.253 --> 00:57:48.157]  And thanks to you with your columns, and thanks to the books you've written, and all the other great people out there fighting, we're, as Ron Paul said, putting out the alternative
[00:57:49.366 --> 00:57:56.710]  As things get worse and worse, we're pointing out the culprits so that we have a shot in the future, and I think we're going to make it through this tyranny.
[00:57:57.791 --> 00:57:58.591]  Well, I hope you're right.
[00:58:00.592 --> 00:58:05.315]  I hope you're right, Alex, and you're certainly more than anybody doing your part.
[00:58:06.155 --> 00:58:08.636]  Well, a lot of smart money said what you said earlier.
[00:58:09.436 --> 00:58:13.337]  The collapse is probably the best thing we can hope for, that they're just so corrupt.
[00:58:13.357 --> 00:58:16.398]  They're not as focused as the Soviets or as the Nazis.
[00:58:16.418 --> 00:58:23.501]  They're as evil, but they're so decadent that it's just going to fall of its own entropy and corruption.
[00:58:23.781 --> 00:58:24.661]  Have a great New Year.
[00:58:24.721 --> 00:58:30.303]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, author of The Tyranny of Good Intentions, on store shelves everywhere.
[00:58:30.663 --> 00:58:32.524]  God bless you and say hi to the family for me.
[00:58:32.964 --> 00:58:33.284]  Thank you.
[00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:38.245]  We'll be right back to talk about George Washington, the big terrorist.
[00:58:41.146 --> 00:58:42.987]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.209 --> 00:58:54.391]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:54.511 --> 00:58:58.893]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:59.053 --> 00:59:00.914]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:01.314 --> 00:59:02.694]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:02.955 --> 00:59:03.995]  There is a solution.
[00:59:04.215 --> 00:59:12.240]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.341]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.822 --> 00:59:57.623]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.839 --> 01:00:12.321]  Unhappy it is, though, to reflect.
[01:00:25.885 --> 01:00:39.915]  That a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves.
[01:00:40.955 --> 01:00:46.919]  Sad alternative, but can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:52.063]  George Washington, after the battles of Lexington and Concord.
[01:00:53.072 --> 01:01:02.517]  Washington made this statement that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to our own government.
[01:01:02.777 --> 01:01:03.338]  He said that in 1776.
[01:01:04.678 --> 01:01:07.760]  Both those two different quotes from letters.
[01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:17.145]  Our founding fathers knew who the enemy was.
[01:01:17.225 --> 01:01:20.007]  It was the corrupt, out-of-control bureaucracy
[01:01:23.632 --> 01:01:27.696]  Filching and stealing and robbing and griming and controlling.
[01:01:29.398 --> 01:01:44.993]  We have to first identify the illegitimate bankers and have grand juries indict them and have the people expose them and get a spirit of victory and liberty about us to go out now that the people are ready to hear the truth and to expose the enemies of the Republic.
[01:01:46.556 --> 01:01:51.759]  If the public is given true leadership and a real choice, we can fix this in a non-violent fashion.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:57.763]  The globalists will stage some terror attacks and try to bustle around with troops and pose as our saviors.
[01:01:57.783 --> 01:02:00.185]  They're trying to ninny us right now.
[01:02:00.245 --> 01:02:02.006]  They're trying to castrate us right now.
[01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:05.228]  I don't want a violent confrontation.
[01:02:05.268 --> 01:02:12.432]  We haven't reached the point that George Washington had reached in Lexington and Concord in 1775 and then in 1776 with his shorter statement
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:22.126]  Of that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to our own government.
[01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:28.793]  We have not reached that point in our fight against these tyrants yet.
[01:02:31.974 --> 01:02:44.319]  We need to continue with the committees of correspondence to expose these individuals and to go out to the police and military and state the facts of the case and to show people the sides so they may choose.
[01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:47.140]  Choose your destiny wisely.
[01:02:48.221 --> 01:02:55.784]  You do not know that every man and woman is the captain of their destiny, the captain of the choices they make on the road to that destiny.
[01:02:57.332 --> 01:03:06.200]  You have been taught to be so passive, to just accept the world as it is and not realize you are the great captains of your fortune, of your destiny.
[01:03:10.523 --> 01:03:15.568]  I'm going to be covering George Washington coming up at the bottom of this hour.
[01:03:16.488 --> 01:03:21.833]  I want to cover some other news I haven't gotten to, some world news, some terror news, and a review of 2008.
[01:03:23.937 --> 01:03:31.547]  To 2009, which they're calling the new decade of the first millennium of the third millennium of the new century.
[01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:37.615]  It is the ninth year of the new millennium.
[01:03:37.655 --> 01:03:38.557]  The new millennium began in 2001.
[01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.625]  But again, everything's a lie.
[01:03:42.805 --> 01:03:43.685]  Everything's a fraud.
[01:03:44.045 --> 01:03:46.246]  Everything is deliberately defiled.
[01:03:46.886 --> 01:03:53.868]  Every form of reality and fact is deliberately turned on its head so that everything is a confusing jumble.
[01:03:54.489 --> 01:04:01.211]  It's like going into a studio that has hundreds of wires all tied together and you can't figure it out so you just throw your hands up and walk away.
[01:04:02.892 --> 01:04:05.753]  There is a method to the madness and the globalists have bragged about it.
[01:04:06.633 --> 01:04:09.974]  So we're going to be covering that coming up.
[01:04:14.264 --> 01:04:18.388]  My son is in there, hovering over the equipment.
[01:04:18.428 --> 01:04:20.009]  Hey, don't touch that stuff.
[01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:22.091]  None of my employees want to tell him no.
[01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:24.373]  You guys put him in his place when he's getting out of control.
[01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:26.215]  He's not being bad, he just sees all those controls.
[01:04:26.515 --> 01:04:27.916]  He wants to get in here and get on the radio.
[01:04:30.198 --> 01:04:32.680]  Gotta hear him and my daughter go big brother.
[01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:33.882]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:34.562 --> 01:04:35.403]  You want answers?
[01:04:35.423 --> 01:04:36.144]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.533]  Okay, children are so darling, so innocent, so good, so full of life.
[01:04:41.993 --> 01:04:45.395]  The world, Madison Avenue, hasn't taught them to feel inadequate yet.
[01:04:46.056 --> 01:04:48.518]  Hasn't taken the mystery and wonder out of their souls.
[01:04:50.139 --> 01:04:58.605]  In the eyes of a child, in the heart of a child, is the future of our planet and our destiny as a species, and is the seed of God.
[01:04:59.144 --> 01:05:03.388]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:03.689 --> 01:05:04.309]  Number one.
[01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:07.773]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:08.593]  Number two.
[01:05:08.894 --> 01:05:13.458]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:14.239]  It's true.
[01:05:14.479 --> 01:05:19.024]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.324 --> 01:05:19.865]  Number 3.
[01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:23.428]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:23.728 --> 01:05:27.471]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:27.652 --> 01:05:28.192]  Number 4.
[01:05:28.452 --> 01:05:30.814]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:34.598]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:35.098]  Number 5.
[01:05:35.679 --> 01:05:39.602]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.823 --> 01:05:44.587]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:44.867 --> 01:05:48.890]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:50.611]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:52.913]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:53.073 --> 01:05:55.415]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.537 --> 01:06:02.139]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:02.539 --> 01:06:07.502]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:07.862 --> 01:06:09.603]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:09.923 --> 01:06:14.726]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:15.887]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.107 --> 01:06:16.848]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.228 --> 01:06:18.829]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.950]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:22.251]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:23.492]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:23.732 --> 01:06:25.033]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:25.253 --> 01:06:30.318]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:30.498 --> 01:06:33.721]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.101 --> 01:06:37.584]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:37.924 --> 01:06:38.905]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.146 --> 01:06:39.766]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.046 --> 01:06:40.967]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.147 --> 01:06:41.868]  All you can get.
[01:06:41.888 --> 01:06:42.889]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.169 --> 01:06:45.931]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:47.973]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:47.993 --> 01:06:48.913]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:03.669]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:07:03.809 --> 01:07:05.712]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:07:05.872 --> 01:07:08.195]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:07:08.335 --> 01:07:10.178]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:07:10.598 --> 01:07:11.980]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.282]  There is a solution.
[01:07:13.482 --> 01:07:21.511]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:28.998]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:35.025]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:07:35.405 --> 01:07:40.990]  I love their Nutri Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:45.254]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:07:45.574 --> 01:07:51.760]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.240]  866-762-9238.
[01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:56.344]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:08:00.612 --> 01:08:02.813]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.373 --> 01:08:06.194]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:31.235]  All over the United States, the people are knitting in fear.
[01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:33.437]  A van's parked in front of a building.
[01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:34.318]  Everyone panics.
[01:08:34.358 --> 01:08:38.863]  The police look like they've seen a 900-foot goblin.
[01:08:40.124 --> 01:08:40.965]  It's just a nation.
[01:08:42.186 --> 01:08:44.268]  There's a backfire in D.C.
[01:08:44.308 --> 01:08:45.490]  They lock down the Capitol.
[01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:47.572]  Men with guns come in and order congressmen out.
[01:08:50.117 --> 01:08:58.499]  The security system is doing the same thing 3,000 years ago that the Chinese ruling dynasty had done to them by their security staff.
[01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:03.467]  Oh, you've got to be behind this walled area of the city where you're safe.
[01:09:03.507 --> 01:09:04.448]  You can't ever go out.
[01:09:05.048 --> 01:09:09.712]  Oh, you've got to have your feet bound because you're so pretty, you're not allowed to walk.
[01:09:09.752 --> 01:09:10.632]  You've got to be carried.
[01:09:10.752 --> 01:09:14.555]  Oh, you can't cut your fingernails because that would mean you were feeding yourself.
[01:09:15.356 --> 01:09:19.479]  And then the true ruling elite developed as the bureaucracy.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.941]  Most power is behind the throne.
[01:09:23.782 --> 01:09:25.724]  And now the police say, hey,
[01:09:27.344 --> 01:09:29.006]  A Volkswagen backfired!
[01:09:29.186 --> 01:09:30.868]  Get on the ground, congressman!
[01:09:30.888 --> 01:09:36.213]  You know, there's videos of congressmen not running fast enough, and SWAT teams are like, get out of here!
[01:09:36.454 --> 01:09:37.895]  I'm running everything now!
[01:09:38.356 --> 01:09:39.857]  I work for the Federal Reserve!
[01:09:39.877 --> 01:09:40.818]  Of course, they don't even know that.
[01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:49.527]  All over the country, my cameraman will be in Kansas City, half a mile away from the Federal Reserve at a city park, filming it from a distance, and guys show up,
[01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:53.949]  Private security guards off their jurisdiction with guns, hands on guns.
[01:09:54.529 --> 01:09:55.870]  You've seen the video on YouTube.
[01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:57.890]  Kansas City Star said it was pretty good.
[01:09:58.311 --> 01:09:58.911]  They said, yeah.
[01:09:59.651 --> 01:10:02.812]  Kansas City Star reporter called me up and said, what's wrong with that?
[01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.893]  What were they doing at the park?
[01:10:06.873 --> 01:10:08.254]  And then they called the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:08.294 --> 01:10:10.234]  Federal Reserve said, we never even did that.
[01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:12.915]  We know nothing about it.
[01:10:13.515 --> 01:10:14.976]  All over the country they did the same thing.
[01:10:15.236 --> 01:10:18.397]  You've got video of it and the news just says it doesn't exist.
[01:10:20.506 --> 01:10:21.867]  That's basically what ended up happening.
[01:10:22.807 --> 01:10:36.715]  I see articles every week about the film New World Order, made for IFC, where it shows us at Bilderberg, shows the black limousine, shows the Secret Service talking into their wrist, the dark sunglasses.
[01:10:37.835 --> 01:10:45.980]  And I saw what the Olympian newspaper out of Washington State last week just said, I'm completely delusional.
[01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:50.605]  I was imagining cars following me, imagining this meeting.
[01:10:51.485 --> 01:10:52.966]  Psychology Today said that.
[01:10:54.527 --> 01:10:56.628]  It doesn't matter if it's all admitted.
[01:10:56.648 --> 01:11:00.470]  It doesn't matter if Rick Perry's on the Dallas Morning News admitting he goes.
[01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:03.132]  They just, it doesn't exist.
[01:11:03.552 --> 01:11:04.833]  And it's their little funny game.
[01:11:04.953 --> 01:11:08.655]  They know full well it exists, like Winston Smith in 1984.
[01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:12.177]  They think it's cute.
[01:11:13.817 --> 01:11:14.658]  They think it's funny.
[01:11:19.687 --> 01:11:21.448]  I mean, one of these yuppies think it's funny.
[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:29.472]  They think it's funny playing mind games with people.
[01:11:30.392 --> 01:11:32.833]  Going, there's no world government, Alex, you're ill.
[01:11:34.474 --> 01:11:37.015]  But I have hundreds of articles this week calling for world government.
[01:11:37.035 --> 01:11:38.556]  The banks are going to pay our taxes to them.
[01:11:39.036 --> 01:11:41.858]  And you went to the doctor for that?
[01:11:42.694 --> 01:11:44.655]  Hey, look at the drug insert for this vaccine.
[01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:48.498]  It says causes cancer, sterilizes you, has mercury in it.
[01:11:48.878 --> 01:11:50.379]  It doesn't have mercury, Alex.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.261]  Why do you feel you need to make that up?
[01:11:53.321 --> 01:11:54.542]  No, I have the drug insert.
[01:11:54.642 --> 01:11:55.883]  You can get one at Walgreens.
[01:11:55.963 --> 01:11:59.545]  I'm... Alex, you're ill?
[01:12:00.606 --> 01:12:01.666]  They know full well.
[01:12:02.087 --> 01:12:03.487]  They're into the power.
[01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:04.848]  They're into the mind game.
[01:12:05.109 --> 01:12:08.471]  They like writing articles lying to their readers.
[01:12:08.531 --> 01:12:10.392]  They get off on it.
[01:12:10.432 --> 01:12:11.533]  It's a power trip.
[01:12:12.469 --> 01:12:13.790]  I get off on telling the truth.
[01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.872]  I get off on a bully starting a fight with me and breaking their nose.
[01:12:18.593 --> 01:12:21.414]  I get off on helping old ladies across the street.
[01:12:21.775 --> 01:12:22.995]  I get off on telling the truth.
[01:12:23.196 --> 01:12:24.436]  I get off on having courage.
[01:12:27.638 --> 01:12:29.079]  I enjoy being virtuous.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.522]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, but I enjoy wanting to be good.
[01:12:35.523 --> 01:12:37.044]  And these people see that as weak.
[01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:38.585]  They think it's funny.
[01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.112]  And they wreck society!
[01:12:44.952 --> 01:12:47.573]  And they always squeal like bloody murder.
[01:12:47.973 --> 01:12:55.396]  When the system they've conjured up, the tyranny they've risen through their evil actions out of the pit of hell that they've conjured.
[01:12:55.736 --> 01:12:59.077]  When it's tearing them apart, they squeal like little pigs!
[01:13:00.698 --> 01:13:03.359]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and get into the other news and then George Washington.
[01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:05.059]  Let's do this now.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.641]  Trying to find it.
[01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:09.501]  I've got my, um...
[01:13:12.995 --> 01:13:13.815]  There's just too much.
[01:13:14.415 --> 01:13:17.516]  I've got my printout about Ecosnoop.com.
[01:13:21.277 --> 01:13:25.518]  And if you guys can, get me the Ecosnoop website up on screen.
[01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.919]  Craig had that.
[01:13:30.119 --> 01:13:32.479]  This morning I came in early and we got it up on screen and everything.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.320]  I guess he's not here.
[01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:39.081]  But...
[01:13:43.763 --> 01:13:44.984]  EcoSnoop.com.
[01:13:45.024 --> 01:13:48.786]  This is a new iPhone application.
[01:13:49.667 --> 01:13:54.309]  You know, we don't have George Soros funding us with InfoWars.com applications.
[01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:57.471]  The few people that have approached us just wanted to do some business deal with us.
[01:13:57.491 --> 01:13:58.632]  I don't have time to do that.
[01:13:59.012 --> 01:14:03.635]  Somebody wants to give us an application to just stream my radio show and my website.
[01:14:03.675 --> 01:14:04.676]  We would love to do it.
[01:14:04.736 --> 01:14:06.016]  Give it to us, we'll launch it.
[01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.378]  There's millions of these applications.
[01:14:09.438 --> 01:14:10.039]  We need one.
[01:14:12.344 --> 01:14:21.263]  Instead, EcoSnoop is an application where you go around spying and tattling on your neighbors.
[01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:38.154]  And, oh, if an office building has the lights on, it doesn't mean someone's working in there at night in an insurance office or in a bank or in a non-profit or in a sprockets manufacturer.
[01:14:38.714 --> 01:14:44.317]  It doesn't mean that there's people who actually work at night in America and all over the world.
[01:14:45.538 --> 01:14:46.759]  You ever been in an office at night?
[01:14:47.919 --> 01:14:49.140]  The winners are there.
[01:14:50.021 --> 01:14:50.361]  Okay?
[01:14:50.841 --> 01:14:53.983]  But the issue here is that
[01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:57.951]  They call it an offense.
[01:14:58.031 --> 01:14:59.192]  They call it a crime.
[01:14:59.593 --> 01:15:02.996]  And they have eco-cop training for kids in England, the U.S., Australia.
[01:15:03.196 --> 01:15:04.537]  They have a TV show in the U.S.
[01:15:04.577 --> 01:15:06.439]  called Eco-Cops.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:14.766]  And it's all packaged in the idea of, well, we're not Big Brother.
[01:15:15.026 --> 01:15:15.947]  We're just helping.
[01:15:16.267 --> 01:15:18.349]  And we're going to save you money on your energy.
[01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:20.671]  But then you see what people are tattling on.
[01:15:20.711 --> 01:15:23.474]  It uploads the iPhone to their site, EcoSnoop.
[01:15:25.322 --> 01:15:30.326]  And it says stuff in there like, garden too long, garden not watered.
[01:15:31.607 --> 01:15:34.329]  Or, oh, look at this gas station, they have the lights on.
[01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:39.593]  Yeah, it's a foggy, rainy day, and there's lights on at the gas station.
[01:15:39.953 --> 01:15:42.475]  As if light and power is evil.
[01:15:44.437 --> 01:15:46.878]  I want to play a video review
[01:15:48.388 --> 01:15:50.591]  Of eco-snoops for you.
[01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:56.398]  And again, this is only one of, no exaggeration, 20, 30, I don't know, things I see a week like this.
[01:15:56.818 --> 01:16:05.528]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall, and while you're at work paying taxes, your kids are in the school you paid for being taught that you're bad and to be spied on.
[01:16:06.434 --> 01:16:17.603]  And they set the precedent with this to get people spying and tattling and filling out dossiers on their parents, on their schools, on corporations, and then they're already shifting it.
[01:16:17.623 --> 01:16:20.605]  It's like they have FBI meetings to fight Al-Qaeda in even rural areas.
[01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:23.288]  You go to the meeting, it's a two-day meeting, you got free coffee doughnuts.
[01:16:24.454 --> 01:16:26.135]  Ten minutes is Al-Qaeda trading videos.
[01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:30.357]  I've seen video that Austinite shot of this, and I've read about it in the news over and over again.
[01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:31.017]  It's always the same.
[01:16:31.558 --> 01:16:32.638]  They show Al-Qaeda training.
[01:16:32.678 --> 01:16:33.599]  Al-Qaeda's gonna get you.
[01:16:33.999 --> 01:16:36.100]  Now, we want you to tattle on your neighbors.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.440]  Are they spanking their kids?
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.481]  Are they growing marijuana?
[01:16:38.621 --> 01:16:39.902]  This is what marijuana looks like.
[01:16:40.822 --> 01:16:44.244]  Has nothing to do with the stupid terrorists, even if you believe they exist.
[01:16:44.444 --> 01:16:46.405]  Have you read the MIAC report on Homeland Security?
[01:16:46.645 --> 01:16:47.485]  It's for you!
[01:16:48.506 --> 01:16:52.088]  And police have been caught nationwide planting drugs on people to steal their land.
[01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:53.731]  They'll kill you.
[01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:54.712]  Famous L.A.
[01:16:54.752 --> 01:16:55.353]  County case.
[01:16:55.973 --> 01:16:56.814]  They want your property.
[01:16:57.094 --> 01:16:57.775]  They're criminals.
[01:16:58.256 --> 01:16:59.036]  They're taking over.
[01:16:59.737 --> 01:17:02.300]  Not all police, but basically soon it will be all.
[01:17:03.961 --> 01:17:07.165]  The highest group of criminals you're going to find is government and their enforcers.
[01:17:07.225 --> 01:17:07.505]  Period.
[01:17:07.525 --> 01:17:08.106]  That's history.
[01:17:08.446 --> 01:17:09.287]  And now it's come here.
[01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.408]  Just get on us.
[01:17:10.488 --> 01:17:11.629]  Wake up before it's too late.
[01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.953]  Here's the eco-snoop lady telling you how great it is.
[01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:27.217]  Hi, I'm Stacey and welcome to the Appensee Press, your source for quality mobile application reviews and news.
[01:17:27.998 --> 01:17:34.944]  Have you ever walked down a city street long after all the businesses have closed, looked up at a quiet office building and seen all the lights still on?
[01:17:35.845 --> 01:17:44.233]  Or maybe, headed into the restroom at your favorite restaurant and you notice that the faucet is stuck at a steady drip, wasting gallons of water each and every day.
[01:17:45.029 --> 01:17:51.757]  EcoSnoop is the first iPhone application on the market to put environmental activism in the hands of the everyday citizen.
[01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:55.862]  It's simple to use and works with any iPhone or iPod touch.
[01:17:56.603 --> 01:18:02.390]  Through EcoSnoop, the feet-on-the-street environmentalist can tag and report environmental issues wherever they go.
[01:18:03.464 --> 01:18:04.205]  Let's try it out.
[01:18:05.006 --> 01:18:09.171]  Let's say we are walking past that same building with its lights on again.
[01:18:09.211 --> 01:18:09.992]  Good pause.
[01:18:10.513 --> 01:18:14.758]  Yeah, in Austin, if you park an SUV at a city park, there's broken glass everywhere.
[01:18:14.959 --> 01:18:17.161]  They knife your tires and bust your window out.
[01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:21.347]  All over the country, phony environmentalists burn down new houses being built.
[01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:30.761]  And then she talks in here about, and it's on their website, about, this is just a reviewer, mobs of them, mobbing businesses and harassing them.
[01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:32.942]  Just what Webster Tarpley talked about.
[01:18:33.362 --> 01:18:34.402]  This is fascism.
[01:18:34.682 --> 01:18:36.483]  This is Stalinism.
[01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:37.263]  This is communism.
[01:18:37.303 --> 01:18:37.924]  It's all the same.
[01:18:38.184 --> 01:18:38.864]  Command and control.
[01:18:39.124 --> 01:18:40.585]  Let's go out to break with the rest of it.
[01:18:40.825 --> 01:18:41.765]  Here's how it works.
[01:18:42.045 --> 01:18:43.106]  Then you see the tattling.
[01:18:43.306 --> 01:18:44.166]  Look at this neighbor.
[01:18:44.366 --> 01:18:45.487]  The grass is too long.
[01:18:45.667 --> 01:18:46.967]  I'm calling the police on them.
[01:18:47.327 --> 01:18:48.528]  I'm taking photos of them.
[01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:53.450]  Why don't you go tattle on some real corruption, like government corruption, or government waste?
[01:18:54.591 --> 01:18:55.551]  You're too stupid!
[01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:57.032]  Go back to them.
[01:18:57.372 --> 01:18:59.974]  This time, we have EcoSnoop on our iPhone.
[01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:04.459]  Simply open EcoSnoop and snap a photo of the offense.
[01:19:04.479 --> 01:19:05.920]  The offense?
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.624]  Yes, EcoSnoop will tag the location of the case so that other EcoSnoopers can monitor the issue.
[01:19:11.684 --> 01:19:14.166]  Notice how it's all in criminal terminology.
[01:19:15.587 --> 01:19:21.252]  Once you've taken the photo, click proceed and EcoSnoop will ask you to select a category of the offense.
[01:19:21.672 --> 01:19:24.834]  Since this is about lights on, let's select energy.
[01:19:25.535 --> 01:19:30.679]  As you can see on the next screen, we are given a couple of selections to better describe the case.
[01:19:31.613 --> 01:19:32.173]  The case!
[01:19:33.194 --> 01:19:34.495]  And you go to the site, it says that.
[01:19:34.535 --> 01:19:36.696]  It's all for criminal filing.
[01:19:36.736 --> 01:19:41.459]  And they're already bringing in systems for spying on your neighbors, you name it, that are automated.
[01:19:41.699 --> 01:19:44.801]  And by law, all citizens will have to spy on each other.
[01:19:44.821 --> 01:19:46.122]  I have submitted.
[01:19:46.142 --> 01:19:47.002]  I can't watch anymore.
[01:19:47.042 --> 01:19:47.963]  Get her off the screen!
[01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:48.943]  Get her off!
[01:19:48.983 --> 01:19:50.564]  Doesn't that airhead realize what she's conjuring?
[01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:01.651]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:04.254]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:20:04.595 --> 01:20:07.598]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:20:08.139 --> 01:20:12.383]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:20:12.924 --> 01:20:18.090]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:22.891]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:20:23.172 --> 01:20:29.194]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:20:29.614 --> 01:20:30.854]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:20:31.254 --> 01:20:37.356]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[01:20:37.736 --> 01:20:39.357]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:20:39.777 --> 01:20:44.799]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[01:20:45.119 --> 01:20:47.740]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.141]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:20:50.441 --> 01:20:52.482]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:20:52.822 --> 01:20:58.805]  Or visit zeolife.net and oxysilver.net and order your free report and package special.
[01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:09.399]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:15.723]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:21:16.103 --> 01:21:24.948]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:21:25.328 --> 01:21:34.254]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:21:34.514 --> 01:21:39.097]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:21:39.117 --> 01:21:40.678]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:40.918 --> 01:21:43.420]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.520]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.681]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:21:46.721 --> 01:21:47.341]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.461 --> 01:21:48.182]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.202 --> 01:21:50.422]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:50.462 --> 01:21:52.203]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:52.223 --> 01:21:53.343]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:13.013]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:13.033 --> 01:22:19.238]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:24.443]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:24.463 --> 01:22:34.593]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:34.693 --> 01:22:36.815]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.377]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:38.637 --> 01:22:40.919]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.099 --> 01:22:42.921]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:42.941 --> 01:22:48.026]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:48.366 --> 01:22:57.495]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:09.565 --> 01:23:09.965]  We're good to go.

[01:23:52.686 --> 01:23:53.647]  That's 406-251-3270 today.
[01:24:05.509 --> 01:24:06.690]  Look at that control freak.
[01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:20.525]  She's got the same look in her eyes as that reporter with the National Post in Canada that called for a global government to enforce one-child policies the same day it was announced in papers all over the world the Communist Chinese government called for it.
[01:24:21.769 --> 01:24:24.012]  This is how we spy on everyone.
[01:24:24.353 --> 01:24:27.116]  This is how you file the offense and the report.
[01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:29.800]  And then you go there and it's like, look at my neighbor.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.243]  Their yard isn't cut properly.
[01:24:32.704 --> 01:24:35.828]  And it's vines growing around a tree like they're supposed to.
[01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:37.951]  Oh, but this person...
[01:24:38.888 --> 01:24:41.829]  Doesn't care if there's open-air genetic engineering being planted.
[01:24:42.429 --> 01:24:46.911]  This person doesn't care if DU's being used at proving grounds all over the country and the world.
[01:24:47.692 --> 01:24:52.894]  This person doesn't care if the government's completely out of control, or secret arrests are going on, or U.S.
[01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:55.755]  citizens are being tortured and already held in camps.
[01:24:57.716 --> 01:25:00.197]  We just had Dr. Paul Craig Robertson listing it.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.681]  The camps are already in the US!
[01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:04.561]  Special federal prisons!
[01:25:05.462 --> 01:25:06.402]  No due process!
[01:25:06.982 --> 01:25:07.903]  They don't care about that!
[01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:10.264]  Look, someone has their lights on!
[01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:11.224]  Look!
[01:25:11.744 --> 01:25:12.965]  There's an SUV!
[01:25:13.365 --> 01:25:14.185]  Stiletto!
[01:25:14.205 --> 01:25:20.728]  I don't know about these freaks with the review or this eco-snoop, but I know what the fake environmentalists are around here.
[01:25:21.168 --> 01:25:22.989]  Bunch of control freaks who want to run your life!
[01:25:23.009 --> 01:25:30.872]  I'm going to come back and hit the decade of tyranny, and then I'm going to get into George Washington, which I know these people are really going to hate.
[01:25:32.907 --> 01:25:35.348]  Oh my God, he owns slaves!
[01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:37.288]  Oh my gosh!
[01:25:38.049 --> 01:25:39.849]  It's horrible!
[01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:42.030]  He was bad!
[01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:45.671]  Yeah, and they still own slaves in Africa and the Middle East.
[01:25:48.392 --> 01:25:56.715]  And George Washington wrote heavily on slavery and said that it should be abolished, and if you were going to have it, it should be like the Bible, where the slave owner was a slave to his slaves.
[01:25:57.551 --> 01:25:58.932]  It's not all the Roots image.
[01:25:58.952 --> 01:26:00.353]  Slavery was a horrible institution.
[01:26:00.753 --> 01:26:04.656]  The point is, the West adopted it, but the West also tried to end it.
[01:26:05.156 --> 01:26:09.840]  You're not taught that by all the Ford Foundation people who want you to be a slave under communism.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.861]  Have you read the Communist Manifesto?
[01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:18.586]  Have you read Hillary Clinton's now-declassified treatise to Saul Alinsky about how she wants you to live in work brigades, basically?
[01:26:18.946 --> 01:26:21.027]  Incredible article written for InfoWars.com.
[01:26:22.168 --> 01:26:25.450]  Hillary Clinton on Saul Alinsky, the revelation of the method.
[01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:26.931]  Good job to that person writing that.
[01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.834]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:30.294 --> 01:26:32.435]  I mean, it's like, you know, communists are taking over.
[01:26:32.756 --> 01:26:33.176]  Oh, really?
[01:26:33.216 --> 01:26:34.457]  The imaginary kind?
[01:26:34.477 --> 01:26:37.959]  Oh, you mean the government openly?
[01:26:38.099 --> 01:26:39.340]  All of them being admitted communists?
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:39.921]  You mean them?
[01:26:39.941 --> 01:26:43.483]  Who all wrote their PhD thesis on communism?
[01:26:43.723 --> 01:26:44.824]  And who are now setting it up?
[01:26:44.864 --> 01:26:45.345]  You mean them?
[01:26:46.479 --> 01:26:48.179]  But communism's for the people!
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.521]  Yeah, that the bankers send in to murder everybody and take their property.
[01:26:54.741 --> 01:26:55.842]  You idiots out there.
[01:26:56.182 --> 01:26:57.202]  I'm talking about new listeners.
[01:26:57.262 --> 01:26:59.603]  You better wake up fast, okay?
[01:27:00.923 --> 01:27:02.623]  We're not going to break and come back with all this news.
[01:27:03.884 --> 01:27:06.024]  I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com.
[01:27:06.084 --> 01:27:07.985]  If you want to be dependent on the government, go ahead.
[01:27:08.005 --> 01:27:11.966]  If you're like me, you want firearms and storable food.
[01:27:12.898 --> 01:27:16.199]  Not that I'm clutching it and only relying on it like Obama said.
[01:27:16.459 --> 01:27:19.461]  People clutching their Bibles and their guns and everybody laughing.
[01:27:19.641 --> 01:27:20.101]  Ha ha ha!
[01:27:20.141 --> 01:27:20.861]  We'll soon get them!
[01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.722]  The last link between us and total control!
[01:27:23.962 --> 01:27:24.823]  The Red Terror!
[01:27:24.943 --> 01:27:26.243]  Oh God, it's almost ours!
[01:27:26.863 --> 01:27:27.664]  Well, yes.
[01:27:28.384 --> 01:27:30.305]  No, they're just there in case I need them.
[01:27:33.606 --> 01:27:36.267]  The bitter clingers, clinging their Bibles and their guns.
[01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:42.235]  I got the storable food and the guns, high quality, because I have the responsibility to take care of my family.
[01:27:42.255 --> 01:27:47.358]  And if you think I trust the state and the government with all the stuff going on to do it, you're crazy.
[01:27:47.838 --> 01:27:52.201]  Give efoodsdirect.com a call or check out their website, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:55.123]  They got a bunch of new lines of great food, organic, you name it.
[01:27:55.423 --> 01:27:56.263]  Super high quality.
[01:27:56.343 --> 01:27:57.504]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:27:57.524 --> 01:27:57.564]  800-409-5633!
[01:28:03.493 --> 01:28:06.014]  Continuing, there's also FrontSight.com.
[01:28:06.494 --> 01:28:10.656]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the FrontSight Firearms Training Institute?
[01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:15.198]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:21.481]  Think of all the communist mothers out there who have their little disarmed children, little 10-year-old boys afraid of toy guns.
[01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:23.542]  They're hearing us talking about giving out free guns.
[01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:25.383]  Oh, I'm a little communist.
[01:28:25.623 --> 01:28:28.466]  I've trained my kids to be slaves and victims to the state.
[01:28:28.786 --> 01:28:31.509]  Trained to be easy pickings for the red terror that's coming.
[01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.290]  And I'm talking about firearms!
[01:28:35.182 --> 01:28:42.063]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[01:28:42.564 --> 01:28:43.844]  And it won't last forever, so listen up.
[01:28:44.264 --> 01:28:49.145]  This is non-drill instructor, non-tough guy attitude family training at the Firearms Training Institute.
[01:28:49.165 --> 01:28:51.305]  That's Front Sight, like the front of your rifle.
[01:28:51.665 --> 01:28:53.286]  FrontSight.com.
[01:28:53.946 --> 01:28:55.026]  Free men are armed.
[01:28:55.186 --> 01:28:56.666]  Slaves are disarmed.
[01:28:56.906 --> 01:28:57.767]  You ever figure that out?
[01:28:58.027 --> 01:28:58.867]  FrontSight.com.
[01:29:00.834 --> 01:29:03.218]  And finally, survivalseedbank.com.
[01:29:03.579 --> 01:29:13.374]  I believe in being self-sufficient, and I believe in training your children how to grow plants, even though that's a conspiracy theory that you can grow plants outside an agribusiness.
[01:29:15.265 --> 01:29:26.329]  They say it's a conspiracy theory that Liberty's good, but the point is, SurvivalSeedBank.com, high quality survival seed banks, non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds, great deal.
[01:29:26.349 --> 01:29:29.150]  SurvivalSeedBank.com for the great folks at Solutions for Science.
[01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:30.190]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:30.510]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:33.131]  I'm gonna go ahead and cover George Washington when we get back.
[01:29:39.873 --> 01:29:48.617]  Then, I'm gonna cover the decade of tyranny, and the decade coming up, the decade of resistance, and the decade after that, the decade of victory!
[01:29:49.857 --> 01:29:50.778]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.258 --> 01:29:52.858]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.779 --> 01:29:56.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.209 --> 01:30:06.073]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:07.453]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:07.473 --> 01:30:08.154]  It's very real.
[01:30:08.294 --> 01:30:12.056]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:30:12.176 --> 01:30:16.498]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:30:16.638 --> 01:30:19.019]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:32.765]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:30:32.845 --> 01:30:35.487]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:35.567 --> 01:30:42.730]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:30:47.014 --> 01:30:48.936]  Or visit Ecoloblue on the web at www.ecoloblue.com today.
[01:30:58.922 --> 01:31:03.164]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:03.464 --> 01:31:07.565]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:07.806 --> 01:31:13.208]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:13.548 --> 01:31:14.008]  It's true.
[01:31:14.308 --> 01:31:18.850]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:19.711]  Number 3.
[01:31:19.991 --> 01:31:23.274]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:23.574 --> 01:31:27.317]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:27.497 --> 01:31:28.038]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.298 --> 01:31:30.660]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:34.443]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:34.743 --> 01:31:34.944]  Number 5.
[01:31:35.504 --> 01:31:39.447]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:39.667 --> 01:31:44.431]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:44.711 --> 01:31:48.734]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:48.894 --> 01:31:50.455]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.675 --> 01:31:55.279]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.643 --> 01:32:04.284]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:04.604 --> 01:32:12.726]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:13.467 --> 01:32:17.508]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.088 --> 01:32:28.911]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:29.531 --> 01:32:38.553]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:44.094]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:51.676]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:51.976 --> 01:32:54.717]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:07.919 --> 01:33:12.502]  I can hear the echo of a thousand ringing bells.
[01:33:15.503 --> 01:33:20.006]  I can smell the cannons and hear the people's yells.
[01:33:23.168 --> 01:33:29.711]  Long live George Washington, their ghostly voices say.
[01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:35.855]  And I still feel his spirit to this very day.
[01:33:39.152 --> 01:33:44.296]  And I can see a young boy growing straight and tall.
[01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:57.925]  And as I watch him hunt and ride, I've no doubt at all, it won't be long till he's grown and then will come the day he'll become the President of the USA.
[01:34:00.828 --> 01:34:03.751]  Absolutely amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:03.791 --> 01:34:05.433]  That's Fess Parker.
[01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:09.017]  We are bringing George Washington back.
[01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:26.901]  A real hero, not Roger Stolbeck, not Michael Jordan.
[01:34:27.401 --> 01:34:31.062]  Hey great, they can catch a ball, they can hit a ball, they can throw a ball through a hoop.
[01:34:31.582 --> 01:34:32.662]  That isn't what matters.
[01:34:32.682 --> 01:34:36.963]  You need to rediscover what this country is really all about.
[01:34:37.763 --> 01:34:47.786]  Now before I get into George Washington and why the establishment hates him and why they don't really teach about him in school anymore or just tell you about his teeth being wooden and making fun of him.
[01:34:48.954 --> 01:34:50.695]  Why the establishment is doing this.
[01:34:50.735 --> 01:35:01.682]  Because if you actually read what he said, learn what he did, and rediscover what America is, you know that it is the opposite of what government is today.
[01:35:02.503 --> 01:35:08.006]  And that if George Washington was alive today, he would probably already be in a shooting war with the government.
[01:35:08.367 --> 01:35:10.168]  Because the government is illegitimate and criminal.
[01:35:10.548 --> 01:35:11.849]  But we're in a different world.
[01:35:11.869 --> 01:35:16.372]  We need to circumvent that as long as we can and hopefully avert it.
[01:35:17.193 --> 01:35:28.345]  But it is time for all the corrupt people out there who have never really had it laid out in front of them, the real choices, to make their decision and decide who they stand with.
[01:35:28.365 --> 01:35:35.913]  The spirit of 1776 and George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or with David Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, the New World Order.
[01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:38.977]  Now is the time to choose.
[01:35:40.427 --> 01:35:47.439]  Now is the time to relearn that incredible wisdom of the true revolutionary trailblazers, our Founding Fathers.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:51.185]  Chief among them, General George Washington.
[01:35:54.008 --> 01:36:03.630]  So I want to play this clip of a breakdown by a historian in a live speech just a few months ago of George Washington.
[01:36:03.650 --> 01:36:07.691]  I'm quite the history buff on the Revolutionary War compared to the general public.
[01:36:07.931 --> 01:36:08.751]  It's so massive.
[01:36:08.991 --> 01:36:09.752]  I'm really a novice.
[01:36:10.072 --> 01:36:13.292]  This is very accurate about the Founding Fathers.
[01:36:13.552 --> 01:36:15.693]  For any of you that think you don't have the metal
[01:36:16.113 --> 01:36:16.694]  We tend to see them.
[01:36:16.714 --> 01:36:17.895]  Not just the people.
[01:36:40.083 --> 01:36:52.047]  We tend to see them as sort of figures in a costume pageant.
[01:36:53.288 --> 01:36:54.788]  It's often the way they're portrayed.
[01:36:56.069 --> 01:36:59.130]  And we tend to see them as much older than they were.
[01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:05.052]  Because we're seeing them in the portraits of Gilbert Stuart and others when they were truly the founding fathers.
[01:37:05.876 --> 01:37:10.600]  And furthermore, none of them had had any prior experience in revolutions.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:17.285]  They weren't experienced revolutionaries who'd flown in to take part in this biggest of all events.
[01:37:17.926 --> 01:37:18.807]  They were winging it.
[01:37:19.647 --> 01:37:20.688]  They were improvising.
[01:37:21.609 --> 01:37:23.951]  At the time of the Revolution, they were all young.
[01:37:24.031 --> 01:37:26.933]  It was a young man's young woman's cause.
[01:37:27.794 --> 01:37:31.317]  George Washington took command of the Continental Army in the summer of 1775 at the age of 43.
[01:37:34.429 --> 01:37:35.549]  He was the oldest of them.
[01:37:36.309 --> 01:37:36.789]  Adams was 40.
[01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:41.210]  Jefferson was all of 33 when he wrote the Declaration of Independence.
[01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:47.991]  And he wasn't chosen by his fellow members of the Continental Congress because he was a great military person.
[01:37:49.072 --> 01:37:50.892]  He was chosen because they knew him.
[01:37:51.592 --> 01:37:53.132]  They knew the kind of man he was.
[01:37:53.192 --> 01:37:55.333]  They knew his character, his integrity.
[01:37:56.513 --> 01:37:59.013]  What Washington was, above all, was a leader.
[01:38:00.894 --> 01:38:02.874]  He was a man people would follow.
[01:38:04.176 --> 01:38:14.120]  And as events would prove, he was a man whom some, a few, would follow through hell.
[01:38:15.161 --> 01:38:17.542]  And he would not give up.
[01:38:18.502 --> 01:38:20.143]  He would not quit.
[01:38:21.223 --> 01:38:22.944]  The army was totally demoralized.
[01:38:23.444 --> 01:38:24.224]  They'd been defeated.
[01:38:24.885 --> 01:38:25.845]  They were soaking wet.
[01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:26.685]  They were cold.
[01:38:27.005 --> 01:38:27.606]  They were hungry.
[01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:33.068]  And by the time Washington started his big retreat, his long retreat across New Jersey,
[01:38:33.914 --> 01:38:36.216]  They were down to only a few thousand men.
[01:38:36.236 --> 01:38:38.057]  That's all.
[01:38:39.058 --> 01:38:49.385]  Well, Washington took stock, just as the British Army was taking stock of what the situation was, and most every officer and all the politicians, many of whom had fled from Philadelphia by this time.
[01:38:51.086 --> 01:38:54.368]  And most everybody concluded that the war was over and we had lost.
[01:38:54.408 --> 01:38:59.271]  It was the only rational conclusion one could come to.
[01:39:00.492 --> 01:39:01.253]  There wasn't a chance.
[01:39:03.351 --> 01:39:07.834]  So Washington did what you sometimes have to do when everything's lost and all hope's gone.
[01:39:08.714 --> 01:39:09.274]  He attacked.
[01:39:11.276 --> 01:39:16.198]  They went up the river Christmas night, nine miles up to McConkie's Ferry.
[01:39:17.459 --> 01:39:18.580]  They crossed the Delaware.
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:26.484]  He had the nerve, the courage, the faith in the cause to carry the war once more to the enemy.
[01:39:26.564 --> 01:39:32.088]  And they marched nine miles back down the river on the eastern side and struck at Trenton the next morning.
[01:39:33.007 --> 01:39:36.688]  It was a fierce, house-to-house, savage battle.
[01:39:37.128 --> 01:39:40.188]  Small in scale, very, very severe.
[01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.189]  And it was all over in about 45 minutes, and we won.
[01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.929]  For the first time.
[01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:49.590]  Now, it wasn't a great battle like Brooklyn.
[01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:52.711]  This was a small engagement.
[01:39:53.671 --> 01:39:55.651]  But its consequences were enormous.
[01:39:57.011 --> 01:39:57.891]  Beyond reckoning.
[01:39:58.572 --> 01:40:00.392]  Because of the psychological effect.
[01:40:01.405 --> 01:40:06.066]  It transformed the attitude of the Army and of much of the country toward the war.
[01:40:06.386 --> 01:40:08.827]  And in that, it was a pivotal turning point.
[01:40:10.648 --> 01:40:15.889]  Washington, the political general, had never forgotten that Congress was boss.
[01:40:16.789 --> 01:40:26.192]  When the war was at last over, Washington, in one of the most important events in our entire history, turned back his command to the Congress.
[01:40:27.352 --> 01:40:30.133]  No conquering general had done that before.
[01:40:31.519 --> 01:40:41.868]  When George III heard that George Washington might do this, King George III said, if he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.
[01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:44.050]  So what does it tell us?
[01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:49.135]  It tells us that the original decision of the Continental Congress was the wise one.
[01:40:51.217 --> 01:40:51.977]  They knew the man.
[01:40:52.398 --> 01:40:53.339]  They knew his character.
[01:40:54.159 --> 01:40:56.882]  And he lived up to his reputation.
[01:41:01.405 --> 01:41:04.408]  Now compare that to what we've turned into today.
[01:41:04.508 --> 01:41:08.992]  We need to rediscover true liberty, true freedom, and virtue.
[01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:13.671]  And we need to understand that the globalists are not invincible.
[01:41:13.691 --> 01:41:18.171]  With all their lies and corruption and manipulation, they're in control of the left and the right.
[01:41:18.651 --> 01:41:20.152]  We just had a giant victory.
[01:41:20.812 --> 01:41:28.473]  Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN, Herman Von Ruppe, head of the EU, announced global government is now being established.
[01:41:28.893 --> 01:41:30.914]  We're going to levy global carbon taxes.
[01:41:31.474 --> 01:41:33.774]  We're going to shut down industrial society.
[01:41:34.614 --> 01:41:35.815]  All announced this on TV.
[01:41:35.835 --> 01:41:37.035]  They said, we will pass it.
[01:41:37.415 --> 01:41:38.275]  And they failed.
[01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:43.232]  Because the fraud was leaked, and we're having many other victories.
[01:41:43.292 --> 01:41:54.037]  And in my experience, every time we fight, if we fight and fight and fight and persevere, if we lose 20 times, and on the 21st time win, we win.
[01:41:54.057 --> 01:42:00.339]  It is the act of resistance that is victory, when you have right on your side.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.921]  Hundreds of battles were fought by the colonies.
[01:42:03.761 --> 01:42:06.882]  And you could do the numbers, but maybe 1 out of 15,
[01:42:09.467 --> 01:42:10.488]  That's a guesstimation.
[01:42:12.328 --> 01:42:18.370]  Because some battles, it wasn't exactly clear who won, but the vast majority were won by the Crown.
[01:42:19.511 --> 01:42:30.534]  But it was the perseverance, and it was waiting until the main British army was tied down with the French, and when their main fleet had been destroyed in the Atlantic.
[01:42:31.314 --> 01:42:35.716]  It was the fact that they bankrupt the coffers of King George III.
[01:42:37.245 --> 01:42:40.766]  And Hamilton and others came to Washington.
[01:42:41.106 --> 01:42:44.007]  What they don't tell you in that little short piece is they said, we want you to be king.
[01:42:44.507 --> 01:42:45.447]  A large contingent.
[01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:47.108]  And he said, no.
[01:42:48.308 --> 01:42:48.848]  And he left.
[01:42:48.908 --> 01:42:52.689]  He didn't want to be president, but the people wanted it.
[01:42:53.369 --> 01:42:55.170]  And then the second election, he got voted in.
[01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:56.250]  That's what the people wanted.
[01:42:57.450 --> 01:42:59.131]  He couldn't wait to get out of Washington.
[01:43:00.359 --> 01:43:04.042]  And in his farewell address, he said, don't get involved as an empire.
[01:43:04.502 --> 01:43:06.864]  Don't join alliances with other countries.
[01:43:07.505 --> 01:43:09.026]  They will come in and take us over.
[01:43:09.046 --> 01:43:10.187]  They will bring us down.
[01:43:11.067 --> 01:43:16.372]  Because the French had tried to come in and do that during his first and second term.
[01:43:18.273 --> 01:43:21.476]  And he went home, to his farm, and died two years later.
[01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.400]  He was offered to be the king of America.
[01:43:27.298 --> 01:43:28.998]  That's why Mexico's so corrupt today.
[01:43:29.298 --> 01:43:30.019]  They had kings.
[01:43:30.059 --> 01:43:32.119]  They had Austrian-Hungarian Empire kings.
[01:43:33.239 --> 01:43:35.720]  The kings of Europe would send their princelings there.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:39.461]  And Mexico's run by a ruling shadow oligarchy today.
[01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:42.982]  Every other country has scum running it.
[01:43:43.402 --> 01:43:44.222]  North Korea.
[01:43:47.083 --> 01:43:47.463]  Everywhere.
[01:43:50.844 --> 01:43:52.384]  China has a bunch of corrupt thugs.
[01:43:52.404 --> 01:43:55.285]  Their people are good, but they didn't have George Washington.
[01:43:55.305 --> 01:43:56.605]  They didn't have Thomas Jefferson.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.841]  The French and their revolution was a wicked counterfeit of what happened here.
[01:44:02.121 --> 01:44:06.522]  And they attempted to take that over through Washington and he said no later.
[01:44:07.002 --> 01:44:08.102]  And that's a whole other history.
[01:44:10.103 --> 01:44:14.284]  But I think about how domesticated we've become in this country.
[01:44:15.864 --> 01:44:25.266]  I think about how all over the country I see the reports, I talk to parents, I meet parents where they're scared of an orange Nerf gun.
[01:44:26.732 --> 01:44:31.396]  Where the schools are banning tag and dodgeball and hugging or talking.
[01:44:31.637 --> 01:44:34.840]  We're all becoming prisoners under a psychiatric dictatorship.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.964]  Mothers think it's good to make their sons and daughters cowards and helpless.
[01:44:39.204 --> 01:44:51.956]  To raise them up to be hapless weaklings like legless and armless gerbils in a cage, disarmed, defanged, so the boa constrictors of big government can eat them at their leisure.
[01:44:55.996 --> 01:44:57.297]  Rediscover the spirit of 1776.
[01:44:58.497 --> 01:45:00.658]  Rediscover who your ancestors are.
[01:45:01.579 --> 01:45:03.820]  Rediscover what freedom really is.
[01:45:06.101 --> 01:45:13.865]  You know, in my film, Police State to the Takeover, we show government training manuals demonizing the Founding Fathers.
[01:45:14.565 --> 01:45:21.949]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, we have footage of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin being called terrorists by FEMA, brainwashing police.
[01:45:24.073 --> 01:45:36.499]  We've released over the years, that's been leaked to us, scores of inside government training manuals demonizing veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, real liberals, who are against war, not the fake establishment type.
[01:45:37.779 --> 01:45:39.580]  You are the target of this criminal group.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.520]  They know history.
[01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:44.842]  They know their history, and they know our history, and they know what they've got to destroy.
[01:45:45.162 --> 01:45:46.683]  They know what they've got to bring down.
[01:45:46.903 --> 01:45:48.204]  They know what they've got to demonize.
[01:45:49.514 --> 01:46:01.481]  But the way they've destroyed the image of George Washington is showing, you know, one of the final portraits of him, an old man, big lips, big mouth, big ivory, painful teeth.
[01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:02.922]  He really had ivory teeth, not wooden.
[01:46:02.942 --> 01:46:10.107]  You know, all the battle wounds he had going back when he was in the militia and fighting the French.
[01:46:11.087 --> 01:46:14.710]  They show that image of an old man and they teach you in school that he had teeth that hurt.
[01:46:15.723 --> 01:46:17.706]  And that he got bled to death.
[01:46:18.287 --> 01:46:19.188]  That's all you're taught.
[01:46:19.228 --> 01:46:21.051]  It's just some boring stuffy guy.
[01:46:22.725 --> 01:46:44.640]  They don't want you to know what founded this country, or they want to demonize the founders and talk about the problems and the bad things they did, which were there, but compared to their contemporaries around the world, these were the highest expression of the Renaissance, the highest expression of virtue, the highest expression of humanity, the highest expression of the Greek philosophers.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:45.821]  I've studied it all.
[01:46:47.065 --> 01:46:51.269]  And it's not hype when you talk about our founding fathers and how great they were.
[01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:53.010]  The world marveled.
[01:46:53.291 --> 01:46:58.916]  The King of England said he is the greatest man in the world.
[01:47:00.057 --> 01:47:01.018]  George Washington.
[01:47:04.241 --> 01:47:06.142]  Turning down kingship.
[01:47:06.523 --> 01:47:08.104]  Turning down the British payoff.
[01:47:11.948 --> 01:47:13.289]  The King of England called in
[01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:17.082]  Several U.S.
[01:47:17.302 --> 01:47:27.112]  ambassadors, one of them Adams, and said, you're going to need a king even if you win this thing in the future.
[01:47:29.934 --> 01:47:31.816]  The royalty really believed.
[01:47:31.836 --> 01:47:33.198]  They said, what about democracy?
[01:47:34.058 --> 01:47:35.600]  51% will vote to rob the other 49%.
[01:47:36.461 --> 01:47:37.382]  The howl of the mob.
[01:47:37.602 --> 01:47:39.163]  They said, no, we have a republic.
[01:47:40.117 --> 01:47:41.798]  Where everyone's rights are protected.
[01:47:41.998 --> 01:47:47.703]  And that's why they've now replaced the Republic with the Democracy.
[01:47:48.964 --> 01:47:51.466]  If 51% say kill the other 49, it happens.
[01:47:55.489 --> 01:48:03.035]  And I want to read to you two different quotes attributed, confirmed to George Washington in letters and speeches, different variants of this.
[01:48:04.396 --> 01:48:05.757]  Unhappy it is, this is 1775,
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.102]  After Leisington and Concord, the massacres.
[01:48:10.923 --> 01:48:24.077]  Unhappy it is, though, to reflect that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves.
[01:48:24.758 --> 01:48:29.202]  Sad alternative, but can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?
[01:48:30.043 --> 01:48:32.766]  George Washington after the battles of Lexington and Concord.
[01:48:33.487 --> 01:48:41.677]  Washington also repeatedly made the similar statement, but shorter, that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves of our own government.
[01:48:41.957 --> 01:48:46.142]  He said that in 1776 once he took command of the Continental Army.
[01:48:48.334 --> 01:49:06.922]  And so FEMA is right to hate George Washington because it is an alien, illegitimate, criminal, corporate, receivership arm taking our country by fraud into bankruptcy and perfecting a neo-feudalistic form of serfdom.
[01:49:07.873 --> 01:49:22.820]  Of shutting off people's resources through artificial scarcity and monopoly capitalism to create an ultra-super elite and shut down all their competition and have one-child policies and bring in a form of tyranny never dreamed of over man.
[01:49:24.601 --> 01:49:31.805]  In all the government textbooks, in all their reports, in all their own statements.
[01:49:33.462 --> 01:49:45.467]  This is a group of vicious, wicked, greedy, control freaks versus free humanity that just wants to live and be comfortable and be free and be left alone.
[01:49:45.667 --> 01:49:46.988]  Well, you're not going to be left alone.
[01:49:47.808 --> 01:49:49.669]  George Washington wanted to be left alone.
[01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:58.153]  But government grew and grew and grew, and the bureaucrats were rude, and they violated the laws, and they were corrupt, and they did whatever they wanted.
[01:49:59.929 --> 01:50:06.792]  And when police shot innocent unarmed citizens, men back then got angry and they went to war.
[01:50:08.993 --> 01:50:10.974]  And these were men who owned a lot of property.
[01:50:11.194 --> 01:50:14.035]  They were members of the establishment, but they understood tyranny.
[01:50:16.596 --> 01:50:26.064]  There's another big reason men haven't risen up quicker, and that is because, and it's now been on Fox News, and now in Japan, and on, oh, they want to put lithium in your water.
[01:50:26.364 --> 01:50:28.806]  And Anthony's like, oh, they want to put Prozac, they're testing it.
[01:50:29.207 --> 01:50:31.749]  Oh, they want to put, what do you think sodium fluoride does?
[01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:35.092]  Why do you think your sperm counts down by over 85%?
[01:50:35.772 --> 01:50:37.214]  And they're bragging in the news.
[01:50:39.071 --> 01:50:40.532]  Oh, our fertility's dropping!
[01:50:40.572 --> 01:50:41.733]  We're becoming sterile!
[01:50:42.293 --> 01:50:43.133]  It's so great!
[01:50:43.173 --> 01:50:46.735]  And The Economist, how the population problem is solving itself.
[01:50:47.476 --> 01:50:56.381]  When you open it up, it says, oh, the dividends of the demographic change, how it's bringing big benefits.
[01:50:56.421 --> 01:50:58.562]  They're killing you with chemical weapons.
[01:51:00.555 --> 01:51:01.856]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:51:02.197 --> 01:51:05.720]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:13.729]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love and care.
[01:51:17.546 --> 01:51:19.747]  Has the two things that you've asked for most.
[01:51:20.367 --> 01:51:25.809]  Easy to make prepared meals that taste great and a smaller than one year supply for greater affordability.
[01:51:26.009 --> 01:51:34.913]  I don't have to tell you that the troubled times and loss of freedoms that we only anticipated in 2008 have arrived in our lives with a vengeance.
[01:51:35.393 --> 01:51:44.335]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours, and comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate.
[01:51:44.555 --> 01:51:46.275]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:46.295 --> 01:51:46.975]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:51:47.095 --> 01:51:50.676]  We here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace, security, and plenty this holiday season.
[01:52:00.817 --> 01:52:04.442]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:04.843 --> 01:52:07.847]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:09.510]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:10.214 --> 01:52:12.876]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:12.896 --> 01:52:19.141]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.282 --> 01:52:24.306]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.466 --> 01:52:34.454]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:34.574 --> 01:52:36.675]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:36.915 --> 01:52:38.236]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:38.496 --> 01:52:40.777]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:40.957 --> 01:52:42.798]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:42.818 --> 01:52:47.841]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:48.241 --> 01:52:53.023]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:53:00.947 --> 01:53:07.229]  If you owe the IRS money you can't pay, then listen carefully, because you already know that the problem won't go away by itself.
[01:53:07.690 --> 01:53:11.571]  You can get help today from the leading tax expert in the country, Dan Pilla.

[01:53:13.132 --> 01:53:14.872]  The IRS isn't going to just forget about you.
[01:53:15.333 --> 01:53:20.094]  Right now, the IRS is hiring thousands of tax collectors to go after delinquent accounts just like yours.

[01:53:52.032 --> 01:53:52.793]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[01:53:52.813 --> 01:53:53.133]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:54:01.662 --> 01:54:03.844]  The core message is unity.
[01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:06.225]  George Washington's the great unifier.
[01:54:06.666 --> 01:54:15.172]  He believes that the answer to how to have personal freedom and liberty is through a strong, united government.
[01:54:15.412 --> 01:54:17.093]  Don't love any country too much.
[01:54:17.513 --> 01:54:19.115]  Don't hate any country too much.
[01:54:19.575 --> 01:54:22.637]  Either one will lead you to act against your own interests.
[01:54:22.997 --> 01:54:29.122]  The goal is to establish an independent America, a strong, united America.
[01:54:30.046 --> 01:54:36.249]  In 1797, George Washington handed over the presidency, and returned to his beloved Mount Vernon.
[01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:42.673]  For two years he enjoyed life, receiving a steady stream of visitors, and tending his plantation.
[01:54:43.593 --> 01:54:47.055]  Then early one winter morning, he rode out to inspect his estate.
[01:54:47.656 --> 01:54:50.097]  When he returned, he complained of a sore throat.
[01:54:51.177 --> 01:54:55.640]  A fever developed, and two days later, on the 14th of December 1799, he died.
[01:54:58.678 --> 01:55:06.184]  He was 67 years old.
[01:55:06.204 --> 01:55:07.044]  Okay, folks.
[01:55:07.785 --> 01:55:19.133]  The issue here is, we're told that we have to constantly support other governments, get involved in wars, but that's the opposite of what George Washington said.
[01:55:19.173 --> 01:55:21.735]  But again, he's not a real American.
[01:55:21.775 --> 01:55:25.417]  Maybe he's Al-Qaeda, like FEMA teaches.
[01:55:26.536 --> 01:55:28.517]  How brainwashed are you police and military?
[01:55:28.897 --> 01:55:35.501]  George Washington's now bad, and Maury Strong and the UN, they're good.
[01:55:38.723 --> 01:55:41.344]  Well, we've got to give our rights up, because the underwear bomber.
[01:55:42.445 --> 01:55:45.486]  But you look at the evidence there, and that's clearly a staged event.
[01:55:45.927 --> 01:55:54.892]  You know, in the first hour of the show today... Well, first off, I'm going to be spending more time
[01:55:55.794 --> 01:55:58.395]  At least once a week, focusing in on a founding father.
[01:55:58.415 --> 01:56:03.358]  We'll go back over key founding fathers, little tidbits, history, more of their quotes.
[01:56:03.378 --> 01:56:05.159]  I've always done that, but not enough.
[01:56:05.579 --> 01:56:13.783]  We're going to get into what America is, so people know the difference between the tyranny, they don't know what tyranny is because they never were given a choice.
[01:56:14.343 --> 01:56:17.445]  They think checkpoints and secret arrest is freedom.
[01:56:18.145 --> 01:56:19.886]  They don't know what real freedom was.
[01:56:21.647 --> 01:56:23.408]  They don't know what our real history is.
[01:56:24.858 --> 01:56:26.238]  People don't have basic logic.
[01:56:26.258 --> 01:56:28.379]  They don't understand everything's not the way it's presented.
[01:56:28.419 --> 01:56:29.579]  Like, who was good?
[01:56:29.619 --> 01:56:30.619]  The North or the South?
[01:56:31.239 --> 01:56:32.019]  In the Civil War?
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:33.980]  Neither side.
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:41.421]  It was manipulated by British intelligence on both sides, and that's even mainline history, but not taught and not on mainline television.
[01:56:43.101 --> 01:56:46.162]  See, once people have a real view of history, it's all crystal.
[01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:51.023]  Once you learn this information, you can go out for yourself and know more than I do.
[01:56:55.199 --> 01:56:56.700]  But long live George Washington.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.800]  What does that song mean?
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.081]  He's been dead for two hundred and something years.
[01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:04.122]  Two hundred and ten years.
[01:57:09.264 --> 01:57:11.105]  He's been dead for more than two centuries.
[01:57:11.625 --> 01:57:12.866]  Long live the idea.
[01:57:13.186 --> 01:57:14.486]  Long live real heroes.
[01:57:16.107 --> 01:57:21.129]  I mean, you go to the store at every
[01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:24.251]  Magazine is a distraction and diversion.
[01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:25.652]  Oh, Big 12 champions.
[01:57:25.712 --> 01:57:27.073]  Our hero isn't George Washington.
[01:57:27.393 --> 01:57:28.414]  It's Colt McCoy.
[01:57:28.974 --> 01:57:29.555]  Doesn't matter.
[01:57:30.315 --> 01:57:30.796]  Oh, look.
[01:57:30.996 --> 01:57:31.896]  For the intellectuals.
[01:57:32.277 --> 01:57:33.738]  Oh, we're all becoming sterilized.
[01:57:33.918 --> 01:57:34.598]  The Economist.
[01:57:35.018 --> 01:57:35.759]  Falling fertility.
[01:57:35.779 --> 01:57:36.419]  How great it is.
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:38.160]  No reason why it's happening.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:38.921]  Just in your face.
[01:57:39.241 --> 01:57:39.741]  Oh, Al Gore.
[01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:40.282]  He's a genius.
[01:57:40.322 --> 01:57:41.042]  He's going to save us.
[01:57:41.262 --> 01:57:42.403]  The thinking man's thinking man.
[01:57:42.683 --> 01:57:43.584]  The eco-profit.
[01:57:43.624 --> 01:57:44.184]  World government.
[01:57:44.645 --> 01:57:45.005]  Oh, look.
[01:57:45.245 --> 01:57:46.826]  They call him Jesus in here.
[01:57:47.066 --> 01:57:48.047]  The hero gene.
[01:57:49.895 --> 01:57:52.538]  The heir to the Rothschild fortune, a complete demon.
[01:57:55.823 --> 01:57:57.745]  National Enquirer, how to distract you.
[01:57:58.606 --> 01:58:00.749]  People Magazine, a special edition.
[01:58:00.829 --> 01:58:01.370]  Scandals.
[01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:03.693]  This doesn't matter.
[01:58:07.202 --> 01:58:11.125]  Knowing how the stock markets and the Federal Reserve work is what matters.
[01:58:11.405 --> 01:58:14.808]  Knowing we've killed over 50 million babies in this country is what matters.
[01:58:15.428 --> 01:58:18.431]  Knowing that if we stand up, we can beat these people, that's what matters.
[01:58:18.831 --> 01:58:24.235]  Tomorrow, I will go over the Decade of Tyranny article.
[01:58:24.255 --> 01:58:25.016]  I ran out of time.
[01:58:25.056 --> 01:58:25.857]  I didn't get to that.
[01:58:27.039 --> 01:58:29.261]  But I will cover it on the show tomorrow.
[01:58:29.301 --> 01:58:31.223]  More informative guests tomorrow.
[01:58:31.844 --> 01:58:33.705]  You do not want to miss it.
[01:58:34.066 --> 01:58:34.907]  Great job, crew.
[01:58:34.927 --> 01:58:36.168]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:58:36.708 --> 01:58:39.171]  We have the eyewitness on with the breaking news.
