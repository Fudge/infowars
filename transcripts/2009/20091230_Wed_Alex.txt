[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:09.656]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:12.177]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:16.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.363]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:29.866]  We have a completely jam-packed transmission against tyranny today.
[00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:38.298]  As we accelerate towards the end of 2009 into 2010.
[00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:39.820]  It is December 30th.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.343]  Wednesday, December 30th, 2009.
[00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:50.289]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.970]  Report!
[00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.173]  Iran to launch counterattack if Israel strikes.
[00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:55.474]  That out of Ynet News.
[00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.491]  out of Israel.
[00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.813]  Also out of Israel, Jerusalem Post, U.S.
[00:01:00.813 --> 00:01:07.357]  readying paralyzing Iran sanctions, which Ron Paul has called an act of war.
[00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:13.140]  Meanwhile, the CIA's running attempts to overthrow the nation of Iran.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.621]  Very dangerous game being played.
[00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:17.863]  We're on the edge of World War III, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:22.818]  Other bizarre news out of the Associated Press.
[00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:23.678]  Spacehead.
[00:01:23.678 --> 00:01:27.960]  Russia may send spacecraft to stop deadly asteroid coming towards Earth.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.741]  You just can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:36.722]  Healthcare vote puts Nelson 30 points down in re-election bids.
[00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:37.883]  Senator Nelson.
[00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:39.303]  Ben Nelson.
[00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:44.065]  And in every poll, every Democrat in the House and Senate that's voted for this
[00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:54.890]  Robbery, this looting, this grand theft of the health care bill is plunging between 15 and 35 points.
[00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.174]  I mean, they are all in terminal death plunge.
[00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:01.957]  We've never seen political plunges like this.
[00:02:01.957 --> 00:02:02.978]  This is the kiss of death.
[00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:07.499]  Democrats hate the government health care bill because they finally read it.
[00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:08.840]  Republicans hate it.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.963]  The banks and insurance companies just love it.
[00:02:12.963 --> 00:02:22.608]  Bloomberg did a huge analysis, one of their financial writers, of the latest bank re-regulation system.
[00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:28.492]  It was a four plus trillion dollar theft, a new four-trill we just learned of, on top of the 23.7-trill.
[00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:32.023]  In the last year.
[00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:37.345]  So I guess that brings it up to $27... $27 plus trillion.
[00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:42.067]  Can you hear Dr. Evil saying $27 trillion?
[00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:55.338]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:57.720]  Again, why are they all committing political suicide?
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:19.916]  Because they're all bought and paid for, they've all taken bribes, or all have a mistress, and the NSA has surveilled them all, foreign governments have surveilled them, and it's, look, you can either take the money and the payoffs, or it'll be on CNN tonight that you've been visiting hookers for 25 years.
[00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:20.917]  Male hookers.
[00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:23.993]  I digress though.
[00:03:23.993 --> 00:03:26.094]  That's in the international news.
[00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:28.075]  I have the financial news here in front of me.
[00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:53.778]  An article written by Steve Watson and Paul Watson that I contributed to.
[00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:59.424]  The Decade of Tyranny that I will go over in the last hour today.
[00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:00.885]  Here's who we have coming up.
[00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:15.379]  Kurt Haskell, the lawyer who broke on this show yesterday that a second reported bomber, a John Doe No. 2,
[00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:22.824]  Was arrested, and they said, we've got to get you out of the airport and out of the customs terminal.
[00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:23.744]  You saw the bomb.
[00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:24.764]  You've got to get out of here.
[00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:28.385]  And then it was never on the news.
[00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:42.690]  And of course, more details of the smart-dressed man bringing the disheveled, who looked like he was drugged out of his mind, underwear bomber on board the plane past security.
[00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.831]  The terror watch list ignored.
[00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:46.011]  All of it beginning to come out.
[00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:55.330]  Now other witnesses are confirming on mainstream television what Mr. Haskell said here yesterday.
[00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.150]  This is big.
[00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.890]  He's joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.951]  Wade Madsen, Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:05.332]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:05.332 --> 00:05:07.412]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:09.873]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:09.873 --> 00:05:12.133]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.754]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:13.754 --> 00:05:14.794]  There is a solution.
[00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:23.461]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:04.488]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.488 --> 00:06:05.389]  Number one.
[00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.811]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:09.671]  Number two.
[00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:14.574]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:15.314]  It's true.
[00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:19.857]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.177 --> 00:06:20.998]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.998 --> 00:06:24.581]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:28.505]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:29.305]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:32.068]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:35.751]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.532]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:40.676]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:45.460]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.905]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:51.687]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:53.950]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.292]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:03.355]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:08.697]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:08.697 --> 00:07:10.738]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:15.741]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:16.922]  How much do you want?
[00:07:16.922 --> 00:07:18.042]  When do you want it?
[00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:19.943]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:19.943 --> 00:07:21.004]  When will you need it?
[00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:23.205]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:24.546]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:26.066]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:27.127]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:07:27.287 --> 00:07:28.608]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:31.331]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:34.915]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:38.739]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:39.981]  How much will you need?
[00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:40.882]  We don't know.
[00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:41.983]  How much do you want?
[00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:42.724]  All you can get.
[00:07:42.724 --> 00:07:43.725]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:47.048]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:47.048 --> 00:07:49.149]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:54.573]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:57.396]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:57.396 --> 00:08:08.464]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:11.447]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:19.570]  It was a world exclusive here yesterday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.091]  Key information was relayed.
[00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:35.996]  The mainstream media information blockade was run.
[00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:36.756]  Exclusive!
[00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:40.498]  FBI silent on plane bomber's accomplice.
[00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:45.589]  I hope that listeners don't just let this fall by the wayside.
[00:08:45.589 --> 00:09:05.738]  We're blessed that the attorney, Kurt Haskell, who's joining us coming up here in about 25 minutes for his second interview with us, and his wife were able to witness this, and now other witnesses are coming forward and corroborating their story.
[00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:10.788]  And there's even been an MSNBC report.
[00:09:10.788 --> 00:09:21.095]  But they just put it out there like it's no big deal with one of the other eyewitnesses going, yeah, you know, they said they found a bomb, they arrested this guy, they said we had to get out of there because we were in danger.
[00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:24.718]  Probably wasn't another bomb.
[00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:34.465]  Was probably one of their agents who needed to get out of the dragnet and so they cleared everybody out to release them.
[00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:37.567]  But the issue is the FBI isn't
[00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:58.986]  Discussing the video that was shot in the terminal in Amsterdam of the sharp-dressed man bringing the underwear bomber, who was disheveled, appeared to be drugged, onto the plane, past security.
[00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:03.548]  Sharp-dressed guy who can tell security, stand down, you don't need any identification.
[00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:10.700]  See, that's media spin to just say, oh, no passport, no ID.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:17.745]  This guy just goes on the plane, which is impossible.
[00:10:17.745 --> 00:10:19.766]  He was flashing security credentials.
[00:10:19.766 --> 00:10:22.809]  That's how I was able to do it clearly.
[00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:33.517]  And once that happened, once he got
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:47.526]  On board the plane, someone else was videotaping and aiming the camera at him, according to a bunch of other witnesses, the entire time.
[00:10:47.526 --> 00:10:53.989]  People are wondering, why is that guy keep aiming that camera over there towards that row of seats?
[00:10:53.989 --> 00:10:57.171]  And why is he the whole flight videotaping this?
[00:10:59.437 --> 00:11:07.902]  I've been on international flights, been on national flights, been on regional flights, and they constantly come over and say, no photography, no videotaping.
[00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:09.924]  I'm always shooting video out the window.
[00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:18.489]  I mean, I've probably had 30, 40 times had the flight attendants, the stewardesses, come over and say, turn your camera off.
[00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:23.733]  But not this guy!
[00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:28.937]  And then you have the massive propaganda build-up about how we've got to go into Yemen, thousands of U.S.
[00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:32.160]  Special Forces and CIA and MI6 are already there.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.924]  There's a civil war.
[00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:37.665]  They've got to go into Somalia.
[00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:39.988]  They've got to go into Sudan.
[00:11:39.988 --> 00:11:41.429]  We've got to invade.
[00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:44.932]  Remember what Tarpley said in Obama Deception?
[00:11:44.932 --> 00:11:46.754]  He said, they're going to go into Africa.
[00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:47.795]  They're going to go into Yemen.
[00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:54.970]  I always marvel at the quality of our guest.
[00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:01.373]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts a month ago said gold's gonna go down for a while because the carry trade's reversing into the U.S.
[00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:09.455]  with the currency, and things will flood back into the dollar for a short period, a few months, and then it's gonna plunge again, and then exactly that happened.
[00:12:09.455 --> 00:12:10.836]  He's joining us in the last hour.
[00:12:11.806 --> 00:12:18.469]  But you see, it isn't that the mainstream media can't get it right and just has idiot analysts on CNBC.
[00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:23.350]  They're there lying and suckering the public and giving you disinfo.
[00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.391]  They all know what Webster Tarpley knows.
[00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:30.233]  They all know what Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, knows.
[00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:33.094]  They all know this.
[00:12:33.094 --> 00:12:39.997]  I've sat around many times at events and talked to high-level globalists who say, Jones, is this off the record?
[00:12:39.997 --> 00:12:40.977]  Yes, it's off the record.
[00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.312]  Yes, I hear you're a man of your word.
[00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:46.893]  Well, let me just tell you.
[00:12:46.893 --> 00:12:49.915]  Of course things are the way you say, but that's the way it is.
[00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:55.459]  The public are even more vicious than us, and we have to be corrupt just to keep them in check.
[00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:59.723]  Your so-called supporters would chew you into pieces in a matter of minutes.
[00:12:59.723 --> 00:13:02.465]  It's basically the line.
[00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:03.366]  And in a way, it's true.
[00:13:04.821 --> 00:13:11.565]  But it doesn't matter because a truly virtuous person does the right thing regardless.
[00:13:11.565 --> 00:13:13.987]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:17.449]  The heart of evil is the end justifies the means.
[00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:19.671]  That's what Saul Alinsky wrote.
[00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:23.533]  That's what Hillary in her PhD treatise wrote.
[00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:25.435]  That's what the Delta Force is taught.
[00:13:25.435 --> 00:13:27.256]  That's what the Special Forces are taught.
[00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:29.437]  That's what cops are taught.
[00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:31.719]  That's the road to hell!
[00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:39.127]  Is, well, I'm doing this for a good reason.
[00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:40.450]  It's a rationalization.
[00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:51.563]  And the argument is, well, there are a billion, 100 million radical Muslims out there, and they do want to take over, and their culture is going to take over.
[00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:53.504]  And in a way, that's true.
[00:13:53.504 --> 00:14:09.874]  They've got a culture that is more ancient, that is based around the family, that is seen as archaic by the social engineers, and it's certainly got its problems, but compared to the New World Order social engineering of breaking up the family, drugging everyone, putting everybody in dormitories,
[00:14:10.854 --> 00:14:17.336]  Totally micromanaging and spying on all facets of society, sterilizing the public.
[00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:21.117]  It's just a competing system, and that's why the globalists don't like it.
[00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:28.940]  If there's an evil system out there that serves them, they love it.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:38.043]  So the argument is, we've got to stage terror attacks to get the people to grow up and get behind our New World Order, because we know best, and we've got to do this.
[00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:49.053]  And that's how the world really turns.
[00:14:49.053 --> 00:14:52.355]  Our entire society is being social engineered.
[00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:57.297]  Right here in Austin, New York City, doesn't matter where you go in the world.
[00:14:57.297 --> 00:15:01.479]  Australia is one of the worst countries when it comes to this.
[00:15:01.479 --> 00:15:04.981]  There's environmental tyranny, has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:15:04.981 --> 00:15:07.302]  Anything real that's hurting the environment is ignored.
[00:15:09.514 --> 00:15:15.620]  All over the country and all over the world, children are trained to spy on their parents and fill out reports on them to the school.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.884]  They call it violations.
[00:15:19.884 --> 00:15:28.752]  I talk about the New York Times when they're not writing articles about how the Boy Scouts are being trained and taken over by police departments to quote, take on American gun owners and veterans.
[00:15:28.752 --> 00:15:29.913]  Oh yeah, they're just in your face.
[00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:41.973]  Now they have articles about, oh, look at the little girls come home and tell their mom they can't have hot water for a bath, and they can't brush their teeth and leave the water on, and ooh, the kitchen light is on.
[00:15:41.973 --> 00:15:54.138]  And then I see a UN-funded ecosnoop.com, we're gonna cover this later when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, and it says report violations.
[00:15:54.138 --> 00:15:58.380]  It says swarm them, companies that have lights on at night.
[00:15:59.653 --> 00:16:01.475]  People that don't trim their gardens.
[00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:05.899]  It's just getting everybody trained to tattle and spy.
[00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:13.666]  And then overnight, it's converted into spying for guns, spying for raising your voice.
[00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:16.429]  People get arrested now, have their children taken.
[00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:17.530]  There's no law.
[00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.491]  You can't raise your voice.
[00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:21.574]  But the CPS can say they deem that as abusive.
[00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:31.456]  Meanwhile, they've been caught all over the world literally locking kids up in closets because they overflow their facilities and beating them and raping them, but that's okay.
[00:16:31.456 --> 00:16:32.377]  They're the bureaucrats.
[00:16:32.377 --> 00:16:33.738]  They're the social engineers.
[00:16:33.738 --> 00:16:45.524]  What you have is a bunch of lazy, greedy, power-tripping control freaks that fill government and fill the corporations that feed off of it and have grown up around it, sucking off of us, the producers.
[00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:46.105]  Period!
[00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:50.020]  And they love it!
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:59.748]  And they're the priest of power, the cult of power, with all the little petty power bureaucrats and control freaks, all supping on their power, all supping on their gang mentality.
[00:16:59.748 --> 00:17:04.752]  I'm going to play this video from EcoSnoop, where they talk about swarming people.
[00:17:04.752 --> 00:17:06.754]  Let me tell you, they're swarming folks in Austin.
[00:17:08.973 --> 00:17:17.200]  You can't take your SUV down to Zilker Park without having your tires slashed or your windows knocked out by these eco-cults.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.502]  And they love burning people's houses down around the country.
[00:17:20.502 --> 00:17:22.764]  They love burning down ski resorts.
[00:17:22.764 --> 00:17:26.807]  They're ready to line people up, put them in the ditch, and shoot them in the back of the head.
[00:17:26.807 --> 00:17:34.754]  And you got useful idiots out there who are buying into this, not knowing how extreme it is.
[00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:42.451]  I'm sure the fools at EcoSnoop don't realize what they're part of in a larger frame.
[00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:51.393]  They don't understand how they are being molded and fashioned into the secret police system.
[00:17:51.393 --> 00:17:52.954]  But it's all around us.
[00:17:52.954 --> 00:18:02.637]  When you send your kids to public school, they learn how to be insecure, how to be peer pressure driven, how to have sex and use drugs, illegal and legal, at an early age.
[00:18:03.663 --> 00:18:08.817]  And they learn how to rat on people, and they learn how to disrespect you.
[00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:10.180]  And that's what you pay your tax money for.
[00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:39.900]  And they learn how to be prisoners, who have to wear ID badges, and are locked down in the school, and the parents come and thumb scan in thousands of school districts we know of, under international agreements and funds, being internationally funded, where the parents are like prisoners that come into a loading dock, a loading cell, like visiting prisoners and thumbprint to come in to see their kids, all in the name of safety.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.601]  This is a scientific dictatorship!
[00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.151]  I use that term.
[00:18:47.151 --> 00:18:52.734]  People who don't know what it means, you better look into it.
[00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:55.956]  This is a group of vicious control freaks.
[00:18:55.956 --> 00:19:07.082]  I know you've worked with people or known people in life who are lying, who are duplicitous, who are manipulative, who play games, who play the victim, who get in little alliances of control freaks.
[00:19:07.742 --> 00:19:11.885]  Who hate producers, who hate the strong, who hate the creative.
[00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:25.135]  The New World Order is an alliance of degenerate, backstabbing, immoral scum who are waging war against the beautiful, war against the virtuous, war against the innocent, war against the weak.
[00:19:25.135 --> 00:19:29.738]  They wage war against everyone, including themselves.
[00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:33.761]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:42.294]  Now coming up, I'm going to get into the latest developments.
[00:19:42.294 --> 00:19:46.057]  Exclusive FBI silent on plane bombers accomplice.
[00:19:46.057 --> 00:20:00.608]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, Curt Nemo, bombshell eyewitness revelations confirmed, FBI cover-up of flight 253 attack.
[00:20:00.608 --> 00:20:01.269]  Hello.
[00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:06.012]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:20:06.012 --> 00:20:07.013]  We get lots of amazing
[00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.892]  People like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:20.575]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:20:20.575 --> 00:20:24.777]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:20:24.777 --> 00:20:29.140]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.703]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:20:33.703 --> 00:20:35.584]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:20:35.964 --> 00:20:37.924]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:20:37.924 --> 00:20:39.845]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:45.546]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:48.967]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:21:00.495 --> 00:21:02.696]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:03.536]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:03.857]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.857 --> 00:21:08.919]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.919 --> 00:21:10.540]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.280]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.700]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.801]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.801 --> 00:21:15.762]  The new name for XQuick, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.762 --> 00:21:19.624]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.624 --> 00:21:22.425]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:25.387]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.387 --> 00:21:26.968]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.968 --> 00:21:27.268]  Right!
[00:21:27.268 --> 00:21:30.590]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.150]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.511]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.511 --> 00:21:36.373]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.373 --> 00:21:40.156]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:40.156 --> 00:21:45.299]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:48.241]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:50.446]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:50.446 --> 00:21:54.756]  Try startpage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:54.756 --> 00:21:55.819]  That's startpage.com.
[00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:10.479]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:10.479 --> 00:22:16.925]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.925 --> 00:22:25.773]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:26.133 --> 00:22:35.318]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:35.318 --> 00:22:40.180]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.721]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.721 --> 00:22:44.242]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:22:44.522 --> 00:22:47.844]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[00:22:52.906 --> 00:22:53.267]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.845 --> 00:23:02.826]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.826 --> 00:23:09.788]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:18.191]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:23.913]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.073 --> 00:23:25.934]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:25.934 --> 00:23:28.095]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:32.637]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:32.637 --> 00:23:34.858]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:42.622]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:23:47.547 --> 00:23:49.288]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.

[00:24:25.112 --> 00:24:31.796]  Well, Daniel Husenga was on the flight coming in out of Amsterdam into Detroit, Michigan.
[00:24:32.833 --> 00:24:41.098]  Flight 253 and he is confirming on MSNBC.
[00:24:41.098 --> 00:24:43.980]  This was actually Monday night but no one picked up on it.
[00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:49.099]  It finally got picked up on in mainstream news today.
[00:24:49.099 --> 00:25:00.689]  TV stations in Minnesota picked up this morning on what was covered on MSNBC on Monday, which only confirms and backs up what we already know.
[00:25:00.689 --> 00:25:04.412]  Headline, second person was detained by U.S.
[00:25:04.412 --> 00:25:08.696]  Customs after alleged attack on Flight 253.
[00:25:08.696 --> 00:25:10.357]  And that's what we're gonna be talking
[00:25:11.363 --> 00:25:20.688]  With our guest, another survivor of the botched attack, Kurt Haskell, who talked about this here on air yesterday.
[00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:36.858]  He was almost late getting on the show because the FBI had just left his office and they didn't want to discuss the person that had been taken into custody in Detroit, the person that the bond-sniffing dog had identified, the person that the FBI said, you've got to get out of here.
[00:25:38.564 --> 00:25:40.745]  Because of what we just found?
[00:25:40.745 --> 00:25:41.526]  You're in danger?
[00:25:41.526 --> 00:25:43.767]  And he said, that happened.
[00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:45.788]  And the FBI said, we're not going to discuss that.
[00:25:45.788 --> 00:25:53.392]  And he said, well, I want to discuss the fact that why are you showing me mugshots of other people instead of the video from Amsterdam?
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.740]  Of course not.
[00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:18.489]  Meter reading.
[00:26:18.489 --> 00:26:22.412]  Meter maids have more investigative skill than this, and the FBI knows that.
[00:26:22.412 --> 00:26:34.223]  And folks, anytime it's a government-sponsored event, or a provocateur operation, or a drill that they use as a cover story to set up a patsy, the FBI always does this.
[00:26:34.223 --> 00:26:40.729]  So, they got a problem on their hands because Daniel Hucinga is now confirming what
[00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:47.323]  Kurt Haskell said, we're gonna call Husenga by the way today, try to get him on today or tomorrow.
[00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:49.344]  Here's Daniel Husenga on MSNBC.
[00:26:49.344 --> 00:26:58.608]  This is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on MinnesotaLive.com and EverythingMichigan, MLive.com.
[00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.420]  Second person who detained by U.S.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.422]  Customs after alleged attack on flight 253.
[00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:07.045]  Hit it, Jaren.
[00:27:07.045 --> 00:27:08.507]  They were pretty sizable.
[00:27:08.507 --> 00:27:17.676]  And I understand that after the plane landed and they took him off the plane, detained him, that then everybody had to go through additional security procedures.
[00:27:17.676 --> 00:27:18.537]  Can you describe that?
[00:27:19.358 --> 00:27:20.499]  Yeah, that's correct.
[00:27:20.499 --> 00:27:30.166]  After we were finally able to leave the plane, we were taken to a customs area, and they brought bomb dogs in, checked all the luggage with that.
[00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:38.011]  Another person was taken aside and handcuffed and brought out, and we were moved into another room for safety reasons, they told us.
[00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:45.074]  We were detained for about three hours before we were finally able to go through customs and get on the way.
[00:27:45.074 --> 00:27:57.837]  I should mention that the other person that they handcuffed was someone that they were concerned about whether there was someone else on board the plane cooperating with the primary suspect after they had investigated this other passenger.
[00:27:57.837 --> 00:28:03.018]  They deemed that he was no threat and was released as well.
[00:28:03.018 --> 00:28:04.699]  Let me ask you about flying now.
[00:28:04.699 --> 00:28:05.459]  Do you feel safe?
[00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.361]  All right, now here's what we got to do.
[00:28:08.361 --> 00:28:12.003]  We have to reach out to the other families.
[00:28:12.003 --> 00:28:26.513]  There was a Christian family who went to Nigeria to adopt two black children and they were bringing those young children back and they are some of the witnesses.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.261]  In fact, their particular names are in that original video clip.
[00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:35.923]  They were on television on CNN with Kurt Haskell.
[00:28:35.923 --> 00:28:41.024]  I know I've got their names here in my stack, but let's dig that out and try to get a hold of them before the FBI gets to them.
[00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:42.405]  They probably already have with the cover up.
[00:28:44.090 --> 00:29:03.983]  And we need, because they were also in that customs area, we need to find out if the person the dog alerted on and the person they put in handcuffs and then cleared the customs area for everyone's safety, the FBI told them, we need to find out if that's the same guy shooting the video throughout the flight.
[00:29:03.983 --> 00:29:07.565]  It is 100% inside job if that is ascertained.
[00:29:07.565 --> 00:29:08.245]  We're already 98% there.
[00:29:08.245 --> 00:29:09.046]  All the evidence points there.
[00:29:13.444 --> 00:29:30.533]  The setup to go into Yemen, the preparation, the hype in the week before this happened, the way the media picked this up, and then now the fact that they were warned, the fact that he was at training camps and his father was warning him and he was kept off the terror list.
[00:29:32.349 --> 00:29:36.811]  I mean, you start adding all this together, it's more than 98% already.
[00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:50.996]  I guess it's just a disgusting cherry on top of just absolute proof if we can nexus this in, and if the man that was filming was the one that was taken out as a terrorist, that was the cover, he'll actually be a handler.
[00:29:50.996 --> 00:29:52.397]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.397 --> 00:29:54.918]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.918 --> 00:29:57.619]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:05.566]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.566 --> 00:30:10.092]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:10.092 --> 00:30:12.375]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:13.997]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.997 --> 00:30:15.039]  There is a solution.

[00:31:07.195 --> 00:31:08.476]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:31:08.476 --> 00:31:09.296]  It's very real.

[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.522]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:05.442]  Number one.
[00:32:05.442 --> 00:32:08.864]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.864 --> 00:32:09.724]  Number two.
[00:32:09.724 --> 00:32:14.606]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.606 --> 00:32:15.346]  It's true.
[00:32:15.346 --> 00:32:19.908]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.228 --> 00:32:21.048]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.048 --> 00:32:24.629]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:28.550]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.350]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.111]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.111 --> 00:32:35.792]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.792 --> 00:32:36.572]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.572 --> 00:32:40.713]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.713 --> 00:32:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.774 --> 00:32:49.935]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:51.736]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.977]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.977 --> 00:32:56.317]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.317 --> 00:32:57.017]  Well, yeah, it's fine.
[00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:27.393]  It is Wednesday, the 30th day of December 2009.
[00:33:27.393 --> 00:33:31.977]  I couldn't do what we do here without my crew.
[00:33:31.977 --> 00:33:35.720]  And they're scrambling with names and documents and facts.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:41.445]  Without Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, Jaron Neihardt, Craig Sadler, Ryan,
[00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:51.868]  Everybody here in the office, our IT people, everyone, I just want to thank them right now for the great job the InfoWars team does.
[00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:54.790]  Everybody here in the office.
[00:33:54.790 --> 00:34:08.682]  Okay, yesterday we had Kurt Haskell, and he's also an attorney at law, has his own law firm, and he and his wife had gone on an African sightseeing safari.
[00:34:08.682 --> 00:34:11.725]  They were flying back in out of Africa, through Europe,
[00:34:13.404 --> 00:34:34.894]  Through Amsterdam, and they saw the smart-dressed man come through security down the concourse, leave this disheveled, some have described him as looking dazed, drugged out, underwear bomber, up to security, no ID, doesn't have, lying about where he's from, saying he's from Sudan, doesn't need a passport.
[00:34:34.894 --> 00:34:38.536]  They go talk to managers, get him on the plane.
[00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:40.977]  Once they're on the plane, other witnesses confirming
[00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:48.294]  Each other's reports that a man was videotaping the entire flight, trained on the underwear bomber.
[00:34:48.294 --> 00:35:07.868]  Then, once they get him off in Detroit, after the botched attack that set fire to part of the plane, and after the man was subdued, the tiny Nigerian was subdued, the diminutive Nigerian, after all of that happened, they then went out
[00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:28.119]  to the customs area were being searched a drug dog alerted the Indian looking man was drug off behind closed doors the FBI came out and said we got to get you all out of here obviously for your safety and this was brought up to the FBI yesterday by Kurt Haskell
[00:35:30.267 --> 00:35:30.447]  I think
[00:35:49.104 --> 00:35:49.884]  No problem, Alex.
[00:35:49.884 --> 00:35:50.404]  Glad to be back.
[00:36:15.819 --> 00:36:17.040]  Now, I just recapped that.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:24.107]  If any of that wasn't exactly right, correct me and then go over recapping what you think the FBI needs to do.
[00:36:24.107 --> 00:36:28.212]  Is there a cover-up ongoing here?
[00:36:28.212 --> 00:36:30.294]  You know, I'm just an eyewitness.
[00:36:30.294 --> 00:36:35.219]  I'm trying to not speculate on what my opinion is in all of this.
[00:36:35.219 --> 00:36:39.203]  You know, all I know is now I'm seeing a new story out today that
[00:36:40.563 --> 00:36:58.076]  The Dutch military police are saying I'm not credible in regards to the so-called sharp-dressed man, but I also realized that nobody's releasing the video that I know that they have, that I asked the FBI to review with me yesterday when they were in my office.
[00:36:58.076 --> 00:36:59.637]  Well, let's not glaze over that.
[00:36:59.637 --> 00:37:00.878]  This is massive.
[00:37:00.878 --> 00:37:04.341]  The Dutch police are saying you're not credible.
[00:37:04.341 --> 00:37:07.904]  A lawyer in good standing, someone trained to
[00:37:09.028 --> 00:37:10.630]  Get their facts straight.
[00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:14.554]  Other parts of your story have been confirmed by other witnesses and your wife.
[00:37:14.554 --> 00:37:17.737]  And so here we are, but they won't release that video.
[00:37:17.737 --> 00:37:19.459]  Go ahead.
[00:37:19.459 --> 00:37:27.026]  The FBI came to my office yesterday and said, hi guys, hope you brought the video from the Amsterdam airport with you.
[00:37:27.026 --> 00:37:29.869]  It seems to me that's the most logical point to start this interview.
[00:37:29.869 --> 00:37:32.332]  They kind of looked at each other and laughed and made no comment.
[00:37:36.445 --> 00:37:40.271]  Well, we're now five, six days into this.
[00:37:40.271 --> 00:37:41.994]  I think we need to start beating the drum.
[00:37:41.994 --> 00:37:44.257]  Where is the Amsterdam footage?
[00:37:44.257 --> 00:37:47.662]  Where is the footage shot by the man on the plane?
[00:37:47.662 --> 00:37:49.445]  You know, I'm going to leave that to you, Alex.
[00:37:49.445 --> 00:37:51.168]  I'm trying to stay as neutral as possible.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:38:02.123]  But they're already, as you suspected from the interview yesterday and now in the news, trying to impeach your credibility, Mr. Haskell.
[00:38:02.123 --> 00:38:07.625]  Clearly, tell people on the record what you saw, and you need to be vindicated.
[00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:15.869]  They need to release that footage before they have time to show some cropped shot of the trash cans or something.
[00:38:15.869 --> 00:38:16.769]  Sure, sure.
[00:38:16.769 --> 00:38:24.092]  Well, you know, Alex, I've done a lot of interviews on this, and I've tried extremely hard to stay neutral and stick to
[00:38:24.898 --> 00:38:49.218]  What I know, which is just me being an eyewitness, and not any kind of an expert witness, just to repeat what I've seen, because I fully expected that my credibility would be attacked, and I'm starting to see that on the internet, and I didn't want to give anyone any more ammunition to try and discredit me, because I fully expected this all along.
[00:38:49.218 --> 00:38:53.842]  What they're trying to discredit me on is my sharp-dressed man story, which is
[00:38:54.676 --> 00:39:14.281]  That an Indian-looking man, around age 50, dressed in a suit, escorted the terrorist to a ticket agent just before boarding, and indicated to the ticket agent that this man had no passport, that he was from Sudan, and that this sort of thing was done all the time.
[00:39:14.281 --> 00:39:18.222]  Two men were then referred to a security manager down the hallway.
[00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.942]  We then boarded the plane.
[00:39:19.942 --> 00:39:22.903]  Somehow the black man made it on the plane and tried to blow it up later.
[00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:27.676]  The Indian man has not been seen, again, to this point.
[00:39:27.676 --> 00:39:33.140]  Um, apparently, there is some closed caption TV video of this area.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:44.569]  It's not appeared anywhere, and I would fully expect that if, uh, if they actually had a video that proved myself wrong, it would be all over the world right now.
[00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:46.230]  On the internet, on the news, everywhere.
[00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:52.835]  Uh, notice all we're getting is a claim trying to discredit me, and no video.
[00:39:55.266 --> 00:40:02.248]  And, by the way, several days ago I broke the story about the second man being arrested in customs.
[00:40:02.248 --> 00:40:08.150]  I was the first one to mention this anywhere, to any reporter, to any news agency, anywhere.
[00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:13.832]  The FBI, for days, claimed that only one person was detained.
[00:40:13.832 --> 00:40:22.195]  Subsequently, two of my fellow passengers confirmed my story, and miraculously, last night, after I harassed the FBI about this in my office,
[00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:32.916]  The FBI recanted their claim and now admits that another man not only was detained, but continues to be detained on immigration charges.
[00:40:32.916 --> 00:40:39.783]  What I take out of that to mean, immigration charges, uh, i.e., we have another man without a passport.
[00:40:41.724 --> 00:40:44.948]  Did the dog notice that he didn't have a passport?
[00:40:44.948 --> 00:40:54.799]  Because you said it was the dog who singled this guy out, but now they're saying no, it was a lack of credentials.
[00:40:54.799 --> 00:40:57.462]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:57.462 --> 00:40:59.104]  You tell me what the story is.
[00:40:59.949 --> 00:41:04.671]  So we don't have a police dog that can smell if your papers aren't in order.
[00:41:04.671 --> 00:41:09.213]  I thought it went and stopped because the guy showed that he may have had explosives.
[00:41:09.213 --> 00:41:11.434]  Continuing with one of the eyewitnesses here.
[00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:15.515]  Apparently the FBI now has passport sniffing dogs, Alex.
[00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:15.836]  Yes.
[00:41:15.836 --> 00:41:17.496]  Apparently.
[00:41:17.496 --> 00:41:19.457]  Well, I mean, this is devastating.
[00:41:19.457 --> 00:41:21.278]  You have the FBI on record
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.441]  Impeached for four days.
[00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:29.323]  They said, no, we did not detain anyone else.
[00:41:29.323 --> 00:41:32.545]  No, there was no one else there.
[00:41:32.545 --> 00:41:34.626]  You gave countless media interviews.
[00:41:34.626 --> 00:41:37.107]  It never got out on the news.
[00:41:37.107 --> 00:41:39.208]  You tried to warn people.
[00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:40.289]  They denied it.
[00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:44.051]  Now because other witnesses live on TV have just let this slip out.
[00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:49.373]  They now have had to change their story and say, okay, we did detain somebody else.
[00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.993]  The bomb-sniffing dog smelled.
[00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:52.954]  They didn't have proper papers.
[00:41:52.954 --> 00:42:00.617]  But you say, and others say, witnesses now on record, that the FBI said, we've got to get you out of here for your safety.
[00:42:00.617 --> 00:42:04.838]  I mean, is now not having a proper passport, is that dangerous?
[00:42:04.838 --> 00:42:05.498]  I guess so.
[00:42:05.498 --> 00:42:09.900]  Apparently they now have exploding invisible passports.
[00:42:13.777 --> 00:42:15.619]  Exploding invisible passports.
[00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:26.228]  Well, on 9-11 they had magic passports that could make it outside the aircraft and fall down to the ground and be found by the FBI, so I guess maybe they do.
[00:42:26.228 --> 00:42:28.370]  Next, the passport will be like a magic carpet.
[00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.273]  You just fly around on it.
[00:42:31.273 --> 00:42:33.535]  Might be safer to fly on a magic carpet these days.
[00:42:34.793 --> 00:42:38.616]  Well, yeah, I mean, you're somebody who could have easily been killed along with your wife.
[00:42:38.616 --> 00:42:40.377]  You have no reason to be telling stories.
[00:42:40.377 --> 00:42:42.398]  Everything you've said's been backed up.
[00:42:42.398 --> 00:42:44.840]  The FBI's been caught lying.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.321]  And, uh, well, sir...
[00:42:47.622 --> 00:42:51.363]  Instead of me throwing points out here, my head is just spinning and reeling.
[00:42:51.363 --> 00:42:52.643]  How are you feeling right now?
[00:42:52.643 --> 00:42:53.863]  I mean, you've just told the truth.
[00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:55.823]  You've been proven to be telling the truth.
[00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:57.704]  And they're saying you're a liar.
[00:42:57.704 --> 00:43:01.725]  But, I mean, clearly, here's the big question, and I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:43:01.725 --> 00:43:02.745]  Here's my big question.
[00:43:02.745 --> 00:43:03.325]  Sure.
[00:43:03.325 --> 00:43:05.505]  You say he's right up there by the ticket counter.
[00:43:05.505 --> 00:43:08.706]  I mean, surely that had video cameras on it.
[00:43:08.706 --> 00:43:10.786]  No doubt it did.
[00:43:10.786 --> 00:43:13.687]  Okay, so break that down for us.
[00:43:13.687 --> 00:43:15.147]  Well, why don't we have the video?
[00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:18.711]  Let me just throw this out there.
[00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:25.702]  Don't you think if there was a video that clearly proved that I was wrong, that it would already hit the media?
[00:43:25.702 --> 00:43:26.303]  Don't you think so?
[00:43:27.776 --> 00:43:33.838]  Well, that's spectacular footage regardless of the deadly bomber.
[00:43:33.838 --> 00:43:37.400]  We've all got to give our rights up to the loving government because of him.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.920]  Everybody's so scared right now.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.101]  I mean, why not show us the devil bomber?
[00:43:42.101 --> 00:43:44.182]  Why not show him getting on the plane?
[00:43:44.182 --> 00:43:49.604]  We had a similar video of Mohammed Atta.
[00:43:49.604 --> 00:43:52.946]  I don't really want to talk about 9-11, but I know there was a similar video of him.
[00:43:52.946 --> 00:43:54.786]  That was all over the media.
[00:43:54.786 --> 00:43:55.787]  Why not of this man?
[00:43:55.787 --> 00:43:56.447]  You know they have it.
[00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:05.980]  Well, I guess because we might see that imaginary smart-dressed man.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.421]  We might.
[00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:11.842]  Let's go over this in case they doctored the footage later when they do release it.
[00:44:11.842 --> 00:44:13.543]  What color was the suit?
[00:44:13.543 --> 00:44:15.103]  Did he have cuff links on?
[00:44:15.103 --> 00:44:16.064]  I mean, any details?
[00:44:16.064 --> 00:44:17.424]  How tall was he?
[00:44:17.424 --> 00:44:25.827]  I mean, just any details you can tell us about the... I only have a few details because I didn't look at him that well, and here's what I know.
[00:44:25.827 --> 00:44:30.429]  He appeared to me to be Indian, and no offense to anyone that's Indian out there.
[00:44:30.429 --> 00:44:31.609]  He might have been Pakistani.
[00:44:32.113 --> 00:44:34.374]  He might have been from Bangladesh.
[00:44:34.374 --> 00:44:36.954]  I'm not talented enough to know the difference.
[00:44:36.954 --> 00:44:38.254]  He was around age 50.
[00:44:38.254 --> 00:44:42.856]  He was around 6 feet tall, around 230-240 pounds.
[00:44:42.856 --> 00:44:45.236]  I'm estimating because I'm 6 feet tall.
[00:44:45.236 --> 00:44:47.477]  I can estimate that pretty closely.
[00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:48.417]  He had on a suit.
[00:44:48.417 --> 00:44:49.717]  I don't believe he had on a tie.
[00:44:49.717 --> 00:44:52.798]  I believe the suit was tan.
[00:44:52.798 --> 00:44:53.918]  He had nothing on his head.
[00:44:53.918 --> 00:44:54.938]  No turban or anything.
[00:44:54.938 --> 00:44:56.799]  I believe he had all his hair.
[00:44:56.799 --> 00:44:59.960]  And that's about the only description I can give.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.580]  I really don't know any other details.
[00:45:02.759 --> 00:45:04.800]  But by sharp-dressed, he looked good.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.983]  He looked... He looked wealthy.
[00:45:08.983 --> 00:45:10.364]  I mean, his clothes were tailored well.
[00:45:10.364 --> 00:45:12.806]  I mean, you can tell when somebody knows how to wear a suit.
[00:45:12.806 --> 00:45:13.707]  He looked wealthy.
[00:45:13.707 --> 00:45:17.890]  That's my best description of him.
[00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.331]  High-powered?
[00:45:20.331 --> 00:45:21.913]  Well, that's... Authoritative?
[00:45:21.913 --> 00:45:24.895]  I mean, that's key if he's some kind of intelligence agent.
[00:45:24.895 --> 00:45:26.816]  I mean, did he look James Bond-ish?
[00:45:26.816 --> 00:45:27.937]  I mean, did he look authoritative?
[00:45:31.198 --> 00:45:32.499]  He looked wealthy.
[00:45:32.499 --> 00:45:33.760]  You know, I don't know if I would say that.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.141]  I don't know if I would say that.
[00:45:35.141 --> 00:45:40.285]  Well, he obviously got somebody without ID through security and on an international airplane.
[00:45:40.285 --> 00:45:47.309]  And by wealthy, I would think of wealthy as he had gravitas or he looked confident?
[00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:51.793]  Well, I guess you could read into that.
[00:45:51.793 --> 00:45:53.454]  You know, I don't know.
[00:45:53.454 --> 00:45:57.076]  He looked to me like he had a lot of money.
[00:45:57.076 --> 00:45:58.838]  I don't know how else to explain it.
[00:45:58.838 --> 00:46:00.699]  You know, when you look at someone, you can tell.
[00:46:07.542 --> 00:46:11.265]  No, I understand.
[00:46:11.265 --> 00:46:18.111]  Well, in the time we've got left with you, I've asked my questions, and I know clearly there's a government cover-up going on.
[00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:19.012]  We're in the middle of this.
[00:46:19.012 --> 00:46:20.333]  This is so huge.
[00:46:20.333 --> 00:46:21.974]  Everything you've said's been confirmed.
[00:46:21.974 --> 00:46:24.256]  Everything they're saying's been proven to be a lie.
[00:46:24.256 --> 00:46:25.677]  Well, let me stop you there.
[00:46:25.677 --> 00:46:28.440]  It hasn't been confirmed in my sharp-dressed man story, but
[00:46:28.976 --> 00:46:40.558]  The only thing that can confirm it is the video because I think I'm the only person on earth, well except for the ticket agent, that saw this.
[00:46:40.558 --> 00:46:42.759]  My wife didn't even see it.
[00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:50.380]  I think myself and the ticket agent would be the only two people and maybe the security manager, you know, that could confirm it.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.361]  And now it's too late.
[00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:57.922]  I guarantee you the globalists have been to this ticket agent and told him you saw nothing, Sergeant Schultz.
[00:46:58.803 --> 00:47:00.504]  Well, that's your opinion.
[00:47:00.504 --> 00:47:03.046]  I don't want to comment on that, but okay.
[00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:09.270]  Well, going back to the FBI, I mean, you did talk about yesterday that they were trying clearly to impeach you.
[00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:14.133]  Oh, you're putting words in my mouth, Alex.
[00:47:14.133 --> 00:47:15.434]  They showed me ten pictures.
[00:47:15.434 --> 00:47:19.477]  Two were of the same man.
[00:47:19.477 --> 00:47:27.702]  And I think they're trying to see if I would respond that there were ten different men instead of nine.
[00:47:29.631 --> 00:47:31.552]  One of which had two pictures.
[00:47:31.552 --> 00:47:31.792]  I did.
[00:47:31.792 --> 00:47:32.913]  I'm pretty sarcastic with the FBI.
[00:47:32.913 --> 00:47:33.073]  I am.
[00:47:33.073 --> 00:47:33.353]  I admit it.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.901]  Anything else about that FBI meeting?
[00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:05.744]  Anything else you haven't said that you think is important?
[00:48:05.744 --> 00:48:06.725]  Just a couple points.
[00:48:06.725 --> 00:48:09.606]  You know, I've been saying my story all along.
[00:48:09.606 --> 00:48:11.967]  All I've been doing is being honest.
[00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:20.431]  And I'm glad some people are coming back and corroborating parts of my story, even though a portion of the public is taking shots at me.
[00:48:20.431 --> 00:48:25.034]  And now I'm trying to be discredited on my sharp-dressed man story.
[00:48:26.189 --> 00:48:31.575]  As I told the FBI, the easiest way to prove or disprove my story is to show the video.
[00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.237]  It's real simple.
[00:48:33.237 --> 00:48:35.460]  It's very simple.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.163]  Prove me wrong or prove me right.
[00:48:38.163 --> 00:48:39.665]  You have the video.
[00:48:39.665 --> 00:48:41.127]  Let me see it.
[00:48:41.127 --> 00:48:41.447]  Period.
[00:48:46.971 --> 00:48:51.692]  Well, personally, outside of the case itself, just how are you feeling being in the middle of this?
[00:48:51.692 --> 00:49:07.556]  You go to Africa to see some lions, tigers, and, you know, giraffes, and suddenly it turns into this circus, and now you didn't just survive a bombing with your wife, now you're just reporting what you saw, much of it's been confirmed by other witnesses, and they won't release the video!
[00:49:07.556 --> 00:49:11.617]  I mean, you're in the middle of a spy novel!
[00:49:11.617 --> 00:49:13.077]  Boy, it sure seems that way, doesn't it?
[00:49:15.401 --> 00:49:17.583]  You know, I don't really know how to feel on it.
[00:49:17.583 --> 00:49:30.354]  I'm just hoping that everyone that knows me is backing me very strongly, including all my lawyer friends and all my clients.
[00:49:30.354 --> 00:49:32.195]  I'm very happy with that.
[00:49:32.195 --> 00:49:37.099]  What did the FBI say when you brought up the person who they detained?
[00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:39.762]  Because they were still, yesterday, denying that.
[00:49:40.464 --> 00:49:42.405]  Yeah, you know, I was very sarcastic with them.
[00:49:42.405 --> 00:49:45.546]  They showed me a picture that I thought was that man.
[00:49:45.546 --> 00:49:47.768]  And, you know, I looked at the picture.
[00:49:47.768 --> 00:50:03.095]  I looked up at both of them, and I kind of laughed, and I said, you know, this sure looks like the man that you hauled away in customs and handcuffed after a dog found something in his carry-on bag that you refused to admit exists.
[00:50:03.095 --> 00:50:05.136]  They didn't really like that comment, I don't think.
[00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:07.397]  But that's just me being sarcastic again.
[00:50:08.618 --> 00:50:14.383]  Their response, of course, was no comment.
[00:50:14.383 --> 00:50:16.625]  Their response was no comment.
[00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:22.050]  And since then, they've admitted that, oh yeah, we got somebody on immigration issues, but it's no big deal.
[00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:30.898]  Which is clearly another lie, because we have multiple witnesses saying, we gotta get you out of here for your safety, and you saw the bomb dog alert.
[00:50:30.898 --> 00:50:31.319]  That's true.
[00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:35.104]  This is unbelievable.
[00:50:35.104 --> 00:50:41.370]  Thank God for the courage of our guest, Kurt Haskell, who's being confirmed every step of the way by other witnesses.
[00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:53.561]  And they could disprove the sharp-dressed man situation right now by putting that ticket agent on TV right now by releasing that footage.
[00:50:53.561 --> 00:50:54.582]  And they will release footage.
[00:50:54.582 --> 00:50:56.944]  They're going to release some side camera that shows nothing.
[00:50:56.944 --> 00:50:57.625]  That's my guess.
[00:50:57.625 --> 00:50:58.065]  Stay there.
[00:50:58.065 --> 00:51:00.047]  Final segment with our guest straight ahead.
[00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:03.193]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.596]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:09.161]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[00:51:09.161 --> 00:51:13.927]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[00:51:13.927 --> 00:51:19.093]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[00:51:19.674 --> 00:51:24.177]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[00:51:24.177 --> 00:51:30.622]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[00:51:30.622 --> 00:51:32.263]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:51:32.263 --> 00:51:38.748]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[00:51:38.748 --> 00:51:40.369]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[00:51:40.629 --> 00:51:41.049]  I think so.
[00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:05.848]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.848 --> 00:52:09.093]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.093 --> 00:52:10.516]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.218 --> 00:52:13.901]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.901 --> 00:52:20.286]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.286 --> 00:52:25.831]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.831 --> 00:52:35.460]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.922]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.922 --> 00:52:39.504]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.504 --> 00:52:41.966]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.966 --> 00:52:44.088]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.088 --> 00:52:49.253]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:54.257]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.211]  Is your computer running slowly?
[00:53:03.211 --> 00:53:04.952]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:06.173]  Don't waste your money!

[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:46.624]  Alright, we're gonna have Mr. Haskell back on Sunday with us at 4.30 Central, 5.30 Eastern, 30 minutes into the abbreviated Sunday two-hour show.
[00:54:46.624 --> 00:54:48.884]  We'll know a lot more by then.
[00:54:48.884 --> 00:54:51.265]  We really appreciate his gracious time with us.
[00:54:51.265 --> 00:54:55.487]  If it sounds like I'm interrogating him, I am to try to find out more info.
[00:54:56.267 --> 00:55:07.749]  In the four minutes we have left, sir, before we've got to let you go, any other points you want to make, any other pieces of the puzzle, statements you want to make on record here for the worldwide audience?
[00:55:07.749 --> 00:55:20.651]  I would just call for listeners to demand the government, the media, the FBI, the Dutch police, they need to release that footage.
[00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.312]  They need to show us the beef.
[00:55:22.312 --> 00:55:22.672]  Go ahead.
[00:55:25.376 --> 00:55:26.717]  Just a couple things.
[00:55:26.717 --> 00:55:31.601]  Again, I have no agenda at all except to tell the truth.
[00:55:31.601 --> 00:55:35.124]  I've never even brought up to any reporter anywhere that I'm an attorney.
[00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:37.266]  Every reporter has brought that up to me.
[00:55:37.266 --> 00:55:45.193]  Not trying to promote my law office, not trying to get a book deal or reality show, not trying to get anything.
[00:55:45.193 --> 00:55:50.938]  Actually, if I was going to promote anything, I would promote my charity, but I haven't even mentioned that I have one to anyone.
[00:55:52.028 --> 00:55:58.851]  I don't really want to get into any more specifics on that, but if I were to promote something, that would be what I would be promoting.
[00:55:58.851 --> 00:56:00.311]  But I don't have that agenda.
[00:56:00.311 --> 00:56:02.892]  That's right, a lot of the other witnesses demanded money.
[00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:06.253]  It's in the news that you didn't demand money to go on these shows.
[00:56:06.253 --> 00:56:07.333]  Oh, hell no.
[00:56:07.333 --> 00:56:09.074]  I don't want any money.
[00:56:09.074 --> 00:56:11.595]  Alex, I have enough money to take an African safari.
[00:56:12.293 --> 00:56:13.214]  I have money.
[00:56:13.214 --> 00:56:14.455]  I don't need any more.
[00:56:14.455 --> 00:56:14.955]  I understand.
[00:56:14.955 --> 00:56:17.758]  I'm not a poor individual.
[00:56:17.758 --> 00:56:22.442]  No, it's good to be independent so you're not easily controlled.
[00:56:22.442 --> 00:56:23.063]  I know the feeling.
[00:56:23.063 --> 00:56:24.484]  Go ahead.
[00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:26.706]  So, you know, that's really all I want to say on that.
[00:56:29.193 --> 00:56:29.833]  Absolutely.
[00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:35.035]  Well, sir, we really appreciate your courage and your story keeps checking out, checking out, checking out.
[00:56:35.035 --> 00:56:44.697]  You privately, well, a lot of people are asking me how you're feeling, if you're concerned, and I mean, you're saying you're not intimidated.
[00:56:44.697 --> 00:56:47.378]  Anything else you want to add on that point?
[00:56:47.378 --> 00:56:52.100]  As my lawyer friends know up here in Michigan, it's not possible to intimidate me.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.320]  It's not.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.680]  I've been an attorney ten years.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.261]  I've taken, you know, a lot of shots at myself.
[00:56:58.237 --> 00:57:02.178]  I've argued thousands of cases and, uh, you can't intimidate me.
[00:57:02.178 --> 00:57:03.118]  It's not possible.
[00:57:03.118 --> 00:57:05.919]  Bring it on.
[00:57:05.919 --> 00:57:08.100]  Well, yeah, then you don't have to worry about things in life.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.020]  What's gonna happen is gonna happen.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.721]  Bring it on.
[00:57:11.721 --> 00:57:13.621]  Anyone want to take any shots at me?
[00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:14.762]  Go ahead.
[00:57:14.762 --> 00:57:16.002]  Prove me wrong.
[00:57:16.002 --> 00:57:18.583]  Prove me wrong with more than a statement.
[00:57:18.583 --> 00:57:20.363]  Prove me wrong with evidence.
[00:57:20.363 --> 00:57:22.404]  I was there.
[00:57:22.404 --> 00:57:25.085]  People taking shots at me that weren't there?
[00:57:25.085 --> 00:57:26.285]  You need to prove that I'm wrong.
[00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.890]  Absolutely.
[00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.171]  Well, they need to release that footage.
[00:57:36.171 --> 00:57:39.332]  I mean, this should be a huge scandal, and I think it's starting to turn into one.
[00:57:39.332 --> 00:57:40.953]  Where is the footage?
[00:57:40.953 --> 00:57:42.593]  Where is the footage?
[00:57:42.593 --> 00:57:46.355]  Where is the Amsterdam footage?
[00:57:46.355 --> 00:57:47.155]  I agree.
[00:57:47.155 --> 00:57:48.936]  I agree 100%.
[00:57:48.936 --> 00:57:54.499]  I asked for it yesterday from the FBI, and I was stonewalled.
[00:57:56.278 --> 00:57:57.459]  I don't know what else I can do.
[00:57:57.459 --> 00:58:02.742]  How would you describe their demeanor when you ask for the footage?
[00:58:02.742 --> 00:58:11.126]  I would say, uh, totally blowing me off.
[00:58:11.126 --> 00:58:15.789]  And if that was a ridiculous request, did I review that with them?
[00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:20.111]  And not to put words in your mouth going from memory, didn't they say something like, we ask the questions, not you?
[00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:22.592]  Uh, yeah, something of that sort.
[00:58:22.592 --> 00:58:23.893]  Maybe not word for word, but...
[00:58:25.888 --> 00:58:27.189]  Something along those lines.
[00:58:27.189 --> 00:58:28.930]  I will say this, though.
[00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:34.993]  I don't mean to rip on the two FBI agents that were here.
[00:58:34.993 --> 00:58:38.995]  My aggravation is more with the FBI agency in general.
[00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:40.095]  Hold on one second, sir.
[00:58:40.095 --> 00:58:40.875]  Hold on, Kurt.
[00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:46.578]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.578 --> 00:58:49.800]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:52.338 --> 00:58:56.281]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:56.281 --> 00:59:05.148]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:05.148 --> 00:59:09.772]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:09.772 --> 00:59:20.601]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:21.221 --> 00:59:30.723]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:30.723 --> 00:59:36.165]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:36.165 --> 00:59:43.646]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:46.387]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:59:53.507 --> 00:59:55.888]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.888 --> 01:00:05.230]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:06.531]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:08.311]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:10.052]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.052 --> 01:00:11.632]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.632 --> 01:00:13.573]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.573 --> 01:00:17.374]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.374 --> 01:00:21.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:27.391]  Well, we are hot on the trail of this false flag terror attack.
[01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:33.355]  98% chance this is a staged, provocateur event or a patsy event.
[01:00:33.355 --> 01:00:38.599]  Whether this guy was a useful idiot, disheveled, drugged, brought through security.
[01:00:38.599 --> 01:00:50.209]  You know, that's a point I want to make here with Michigander, Kurt Haskell, with his wife, coming back from an African safari, coming through Europe, coming through Amsterdam,
[01:00:52.006 --> 01:00:55.368]  Uh, witnessing this guy be bypassing security with a sharp-breasted man.
[01:00:55.368 --> 01:01:00.532]  I've seen that in the news days ago, that they don't know how he bypassed regular security.
[01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.473]  And so that proves your story.
[01:01:02.473 --> 01:01:03.894]  How did he get through security?
[01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.135]  But they won't release the footage.
[01:01:05.135 --> 01:01:07.997]  So, Mr. Haskell, you'll be back with us for 20 minutes.
[01:01:08.677 --> 01:01:09.217]  My story has never changed.
[01:01:09.217 --> 01:01:11.598]  I've repeated it hundreds of times to people all over the world.
[01:01:11.598 --> 01:01:14.139]  I've never changed anything in my story.
[01:01:38.823 --> 01:01:52.092]  From the first time I reported my story to a reporter, I was talking about the second man that I saw hauled off after a dog found something in his carry-on bag.
[01:01:52.092 --> 01:01:53.713]  This was five days ago.
[01:01:53.713 --> 01:02:03.539]  The FBI flat-out denied it and said only one man was detained, the terrorist man.
[01:02:03.539 --> 01:02:07.602]  I was glad to see, I believe yesterday, a couple of my fellow passengers came out and said,
[01:02:08.143 --> 01:02:34.866]  Yeah, uh, Mr. Haskell is right, and backed up what I said, and then, uh, you know, I harassed the FBI about it yesterday when they were in my office, when they showed me a picture of what, who I thought was, indeed, this man, and, uh, amazingly, last night, the FBI story changed, and now, oh, whoops, there is a second man, but, uh, he's, he, uh, wasn't arrested, he's just being held by custom, indefinitely,
[01:02:35.678 --> 01:02:38.700]  On some sort of immigration charge.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.522]  Immigration charge being what?
[01:02:41.522 --> 01:02:43.184]  He didn't have a passport either?
[01:02:43.184 --> 01:02:47.246]  Can they be a little more specific on what that is?
[01:02:47.246 --> 01:02:49.288]  I haven't heard that yet.
[01:02:49.288 --> 01:03:01.677]  Also, ChiPol Airport Security came out the other day and said the terrorist man did not have to go through normal passport checking procedures at the airport.
[01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:10.877]  And, uh, now they come out today and said he did show his passport, which post holes in my story, according to them.
[01:03:10.877 --> 01:03:16.041]  But, uh, those two statements aren't necessarily at odds with each other.
[01:03:16.041 --> 01:03:29.752]  Um, he didn't go through normal passport checking procedures and he showed his passport, but how do we not know that maybe he just didn't flash it to a security manager in the back room or something, which would tie, uh,
[01:03:30.478 --> 01:03:32.720]  Both their accounts together as well as mine.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.280]  We don't know.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:44.128]  Amazing that they're saying he showed his passport now when the other day he didn't go through normal passport checking procedures.
[01:03:44.128 --> 01:03:47.491]  By the way, could they please define that?
[01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:51.794]  What is the definition of not a normal passport checking procedure?
[01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:55.797]  I would really like a very specific definition of that.
[01:03:55.797 --> 01:03:58.219]  Just a couple of thoughts in my head today.
[01:04:00.529 --> 01:04:05.850]  Man, they are certainly covering something up and there's no discussion in the media.
[01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:17.092]  Where's the footage of the man filming the entire flight and calmly filming the incident with the underwear bomber?
[01:04:17.092 --> 01:04:20.513]  Some witnesses have said that he looked dazed or drugged.
[01:04:20.513 --> 01:04:25.393]  What did he look like when you saw him brought through by the sharp-dressed man?
[01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:28.154]  The best way I could describe him would be emotionless.
[01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:37.674]  So he was zombie-like?
[01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:47.357]  You know, zombie-like to me is a definition that would entail, you know, blurry or unclear eyes and I can't really verify that.
[01:04:47.357 --> 01:04:48.457]  He was just blank.
[01:04:48.457 --> 01:04:49.377]  He was blank.
[01:04:49.377 --> 01:04:53.098]  I would say emotionless is the best way that I could describe him.
[01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:53.779]  Alright.
[01:04:53.779 --> 01:04:55.519]  We'll talk to you again Sunday.
[01:04:55.519 --> 01:04:57.420]  We appreciate your courage.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.841]  Kurt Haskell from Michigan, a survivor of the underwear bombing attack.
[01:05:01.701 --> 01:05:05.726]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.726 --> 01:05:08.989]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:13.774]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:13.774 --> 01:05:20.181]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.181 --> 01:05:22.424]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:22.944 --> 01:05:23.244]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.244 --> 01:05:23.745]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:24.426]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.426 --> 01:05:25.707]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:25.707 --> 01:05:27.950]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:41.846 --> 01:05:46.230]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:49.133]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:58.241]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:00.882 --> 01:06:03.883]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.883 --> 01:06:09.224]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.224 --> 01:06:11.264]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.264 --> 01:06:16.266]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.266 --> 01:06:17.446]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.446 --> 01:06:18.566]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.566 --> 01:06:20.446]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.446 --> 01:06:21.527]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.527 --> 01:06:23.727]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.727 --> 01:06:25.068]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:26.588]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.588 --> 01:06:26.928]  If there's a
[01:06:27.008 --> 01:06:29.129]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:06:29.129 --> 01:06:31.850]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:35.451]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.451 --> 01:06:39.252]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.252 --> 01:06:40.493]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.493 --> 01:06:41.393]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.393 --> 01:06:42.493]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.493 --> 01:06:43.234]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.234 --> 01:06:44.234]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.514 --> 01:06:47.578]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:06:59.855 --> 01:07:06.840]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.121]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[01:08:19.782 --> 01:08:30.390]  Wayne Madsen, who works for the National Security Agency and other even more secretive federal agencies involved in national security, will be our guest until 50 after.
[01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:32.492]  Then he's got to go on international television program.
[01:08:32.492 --> 01:08:35.334]  He's live at the Russia Today studios.
[01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:38.197]  He is going to be joining us here in just a few minutes to talk about
[01:08:39.127 --> 01:08:44.974]  Healthcare that the Democrats, rank and file, are even turning against as they find out it's a giant boondoggle.
[01:08:44.974 --> 01:08:53.663]  We're going to be talking also about the underwear bomber, get his expert take on whether he thinks that's an inside job or a provocateur to action.
[01:08:53.663 --> 01:09:00.330]  I'm going to play a short clip of Tarpley from television, who stunningly in three minutes boiled down my view exactly.
[01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:04.334]  When I do it in a more long-winded form, because there's so much data.
[01:09:04.334 --> 01:09:06.536]  Tarpley joins us tomorrow, by the way.
[01:09:06.536 --> 01:09:09.899]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us in the next hour.
[01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:13.943]  In the last hour, I've got a host of news.
[01:09:13.943 --> 01:09:15.864]  I've got the Decade of Tyranny in review.
[01:09:18.134 --> 01:09:22.838]  From PrisonPlanet.com, written by Alex Jones, Steve Watson, and Paul Watson.
[01:09:22.838 --> 01:09:25.261]  I want to go over what's happened in the last decade.
[01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:30.225]  I want to get into these EcoSnoop programs with a new iPhone application for citizen spies.
[01:09:30.225 --> 01:09:31.667]  This is chilling.
[01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.109]  That's in the last hour today.
[01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:37.112]  But before I go to Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:46.065]  I wanted to encourage listeners before this year ends to take advantage of the specials.
[01:09:46.065 --> 01:09:48.328]  We have the Christmas holiday specials.
[01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:50.330]  They are being changed.
[01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.453]  We'll have some new specials.
[01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:56.658]  And I'm sure they'll be good, but we've never had specials this good.
[01:09:56.658 --> 01:09:57.358]  Okay?
[01:09:57.358 --> 01:09:58.400]  Free t-shirt.
[01:09:59.548 --> 01:10:12.916]  When you get Fall of the Republic, 1995, two plus hour film, exposing the whole globalist agenda, the fake environmental movement, the police state they're setting up, Obama the front man, Bush 2, Bush 3.
[01:10:12.916 --> 01:10:15.037]  This is the film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:10:15.037 --> 01:10:17.198]  By the way, Wayne Madsen's in it.
[01:10:17.198 --> 01:10:24.303]  Max Keiser, Webster Tarpley, Jesse Ventura, and the list goes on and on.
[01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.244]  Alan Watt, myself.
[01:10:27.813 --> 01:10:29.574]  Full of the Republic.
[01:10:29.574 --> 01:10:31.495]  Get a free Obama Joker shirt.
[01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:34.356]  Great to strike up conversations on the street.
[01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:36.277]  Free Don't Tread on Me shirts.
[01:10:36.277 --> 01:10:39.098]  A bunch of different t-shirts you can get free with it.
[01:10:39.098 --> 01:10:41.199]  Now I told you all supplies last.
[01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:44.081]  We are selling out of the Obama Joker shirts.
[01:10:44.081 --> 01:10:45.642]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:48.203]  So there's quite a few sizes you can't get.
[01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:52.123]  But you can probably get it in your size in another message.
[01:10:52.123 --> 01:11:01.610]  There's, what, eight different messages in a bunch of different sizes that says Obama Socialism, Obama Fascism, Obama New World Order, ObamaInfoWars.com.
[01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.112]  On the back, there's different messages.
[01:11:03.112 --> 01:11:03.872]  Just go check them out.
[01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:05.473]  A lot of them have sold out.
[01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:07.555]  We're going to have this deal until they sell out.
[01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:08.436]  They're almost gone.
[01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:13.720]  But if those are sold out, you can just get the Don't Tread on Me shirts, they're just as popular.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.621]  But when the Obama shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:11:15.621 --> 01:11:38.060]  I've got a bunch of other specials, free DVDs, free Obama deception, free Reflections and Warnings with Aaron Russo, InfoWars.com, the online video bookstore shopping cart, also all the Patriot apparel, to spread the word, and fund our operation so we can be healthy and strong and grow, not just stay the same size, and fund our operation and not be beholden to the New World Order and George Soros.
[01:11:38.829 --> 01:11:42.091]  So again, we are self-funded thanks to you.
[01:11:42.091 --> 01:11:44.833]  I want to thank all of you out there.
[01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:47.635]  Great deals we're passing on to you to get the word out.
[01:11:47.635 --> 01:11:51.437]  PrisonPlanet.tv, we're running this deal about a week into the new year.
[01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:52.918]  It's the New Year's special.
[01:11:52.918 --> 01:11:55.600]  Five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.401]  It's normally 15 cents a day.
[01:11:57.401 --> 01:11:58.322]  What does that come down to?
[01:11:58.322 --> 01:12:00.603]  Like seven and a half, eight cents a day.
[01:12:00.603 --> 01:12:03.205]  Do a monthly trial membership, get a yearly membership, whatever.
[01:12:03.205 --> 01:12:05.926]  PrisonPlanet.tv, watch the live radio show.
[01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:07.247]  We sound broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:12:18.123 --> 01:12:20.043]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:20.043 --> 01:12:21.624]  Okay, enough said.
[01:12:21.624 --> 01:12:26.945]  Now for the remainder of the time we have left, until 50 after, I go to Wayne Madsen.
[01:12:26.945 --> 01:12:31.367]  Be sure and support him as well at WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:12:31.367 --> 01:12:35.648]  It's important to support alternative media that tells the truth.
[01:12:35.648 --> 01:12:38.189]  Wayne Madsen, great to have you here with us at Year End, sir.
[01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:41.264]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:12:41.264 --> 01:12:42.966]  Well, there's so much to discuss.
[01:12:42.966 --> 01:12:51.573]  I wanted to get you on about health care as the real left finds out this is a boondoggle and as the right is against it, where you see that going?
[01:12:51.573 --> 01:12:54.556]  Is it political suicide for the Democrats?
[01:12:54.556 --> 01:12:55.237]  I wanted to get into
[01:12:56.898 --> 01:13:03.903]  How they want to attack Yemen last week before the bombing happened, but you were busy, we couldn't get you on in time for that.
[01:13:03.903 --> 01:13:09.346]  I wanted to get you on, and now they've staged the event to go into Yemen, or we'll see if you agree.
[01:13:09.346 --> 01:13:23.676]  I wanted to get you on about the dollar, and all this is happening, but I would imagine, first off, Wayne Madsen, with your expertise on intelligence and false flag, you'll probably want to discuss the underwear bomber first, or am I wrong?
[01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:27.758]  No, that's the item of the day, I think.
[01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:32.782]  This is clearly a false flag operation, if there ever was one.
[01:13:32.782 --> 01:13:46.732]  It's got all the components of one, and now we see the counterclaims, the counter-propaganda coming out of the usual suspects, where eyewitness accounts are now being, basically, they're being attacked.
[01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:48.674]  The two lawyers, the Haskells,
[01:13:49.447 --> 01:13:50.868]  from Michigan.
[01:13:50.868 --> 01:14:02.717]  It's being said now that this Mutalaab, the attempted underwear bomber, was traveling with a passport, but he didn't show a passport when he boarded the flight.
[01:14:02.717 --> 01:14:16.868]  And this well-dressed Indian gentleman that arranged for him to get on the flight parading, I guess, as a Sudanese refugee, I'm being told by my intelligence sources in Asia that that guy is probably
[01:14:17.492 --> 01:14:31.353]  Uh, Indian Research and Analysis Wing agent, R.A.W., is the Indian version of our CIA, and that this was an operation conducted jointly by R.A.W., Mossad, and the CIA.
[01:14:33.624 --> 01:14:50.550]  Now, it just came out in the British BBC London Telegraph last week that, yes, it's true what Indian intelligence said in Mumbai a year ago was true that British, US, and Israeli intelligence was running commandos, killing people.
[01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:59.714]  They then shot a few patsies, dressed them up, shot one guy up full of LSD, and that's the patsy, but he himself is US intelligence.
[01:14:59.714 --> 01:15:02.355]  Same thing with Mohammed Atta and the Springman, the head of the
[01:15:03.115 --> 01:15:10.219]  Embassy before 9-11, being told let the hijackers in, their terror designation is a CIA cover.
[01:15:10.219 --> 01:15:21.764]  We see this over and over and over again, Wayne, and we have the Indian man on the plane videotaping the entire flight, trained on the underwear bomber.
[01:15:21.764 --> 01:15:25.206]  The feds don't want to say where that footage is.
[01:15:25.206 --> 01:15:27.907]  I interviewed Haskell two days in a row.
[01:15:27.907 --> 01:15:30.409]  Haskell was at Detroit.
[01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:33.290]  I want your take on this.
[01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:43.094]  Inside of the customs area being searched, a dog alerted on another Indian man's bag.
[01:15:43.094 --> 01:15:46.015]  They took him behind closed doors and said, you've got to get out of here for your safety.
[01:15:46.015 --> 01:15:47.135]  Bomb.
[01:15:47.135 --> 01:15:48.256]  They all get out of there.
[01:15:48.256 --> 01:15:51.897]  Now other witnesses have come forward on TV and said, no, that did happen.
[01:15:51.897 --> 01:15:56.579]  And so the feds have suddenly recanted and said, OK, we did detain somebody else.
[01:15:56.579 --> 01:15:59.800]  I mean, this is this blew up in their face, didn't it, Wayne?
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.060]  Absolutely.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.822]  You know, it reminds me of the Fort Hood shooter.
[01:16:04.822 --> 01:16:09.504]  We were told that there were some other people arrested there, and then we were told they weren't arrested.
[01:16:09.504 --> 01:16:12.385]  And this is the same type of thing, and this happens every time.
[01:16:12.385 --> 01:16:20.289]  Look, you can take this kind of stuff back to the Dealey Plaza in 1963, because in Dallas there were other people arrested
[01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:26.465]  Uh, in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy, and then they just simply disappeared.
[01:16:26.465 --> 01:16:29.650]  You know, and then the FBI says, you didn't see anything.
[01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:30.451]  No, you're wrong.
[01:16:30.451 --> 01:16:33.315]  And you know, this is what we're starting to hear out of the typical
[01:16:33.934 --> 01:16:38.798]  Neoconservative media about the hassles, that they were somehow mistaken.
[01:16:38.798 --> 01:16:42.020]  Well, you can't be mistaken about things like this.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:46.824]  I would also note there's some very strange information coming out about Jasper Scheringa.
[01:16:46.824 --> 01:17:01.896]  Remember, he's the young Dutch guy who got his Andy Warhol 15 minutes of fame, who supposedly, you know, he wrestled Mutalab, you know, down and prevented him from detonating his underwear and blowing a hole in the fuselage of the airplane.
[01:17:02.481 --> 01:17:26.945]  It turns out that Sheringa, the person who drove him to the airport, a guy named Chris Van Amersfoort, he drove him to the airport on Christmas morning, and she, Paul, lists as one of his friends on his Facebook page, the Emir of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid bin Maktoum.
[01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:29.706]  And now we know that there was another report
[01:17:30.588 --> 01:17:45.974]  That a Dhalo Airlines passenger attempted to board a plane in Mogadishu last month with a syringe powder and liquid, was not allowed to board that flight.
[01:17:45.974 --> 01:17:58.639]  I would point out that Dhalo Airlines is owned by Dubai World, the company that's owned by the Emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who just so happens to be listed as a friend on
[01:17:59.193 --> 01:17:59.373]  Yeah, I
[01:18:29.112 --> 01:18:52.785]  I mean, I'm no defender of Obama, but looking at this, and I want your expert take on this, Wayne Madsen, it appears this is probably a neocon job in the rogue networks, even outside of Obama, but tied into the Israeli angle, because the way they're pressuring Obama, saying he's got to get tough, he's got to get tough on the war on terror, and the left saying, oh look, he is tough, as a way of co-opting the left,
[01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:58.387]  Well, I believe that's it, because this comes right after we have another forgery.
[01:18:58.387 --> 01:18:59.887]  These Iran nuclear weapons documents.
[01:18:59.887 --> 01:19:01.568]  Turns out that that was a forgery.
[01:19:22.129 --> 01:19:40.175]  Uh, and now we have something, uh, again it looks like another forgery that, uh, uh, Khamenei, the Supreme Ayatollah of Iran, uh, something that was supposedly faxed out of Iran, says that he's got plans to leave Iran with his family and flee to Russia.
[01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:43.756]  I mean, these are the times of the, uh, phony documents.
[01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:45.098]  Our economy is in great distress.
[01:19:45.098 --> 01:19:46.979]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[01:19:46.979 --> 01:19:49.680]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[01:20:14.451 --> 01:20:17.093]  You have auto and home insurance.
[01:20:17.093 --> 01:20:20.315]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:26.258]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term because it might take years to recover?
[01:20:26.258 --> 01:20:32.802]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[01:20:32.802 --> 01:20:40.067]  Survivalistseeds.com is offering a package that will give you a three acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[01:20:41.118 --> 01:20:48.225]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.

[01:21:02.248 --> 01:21:06.275]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:06.275 --> 01:21:09.520]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.923]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:11.627 --> 01:21:14.288]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.288 --> 01:21:20.689]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:25.871]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:25.871 --> 01:21:35.873]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.993 --> 01:21:38.334]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.334 --> 01:21:39.914]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.914 --> 01:21:42.375]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:44.496]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.496 --> 01:21:49.658]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:23:04.716 --> 01:23:07.017]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:07.017 --> 01:23:07.877]  Don't!
[01:23:07.877 --> 01:23:11.319]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:18.441]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:36.171]  Herb K was right.
[01:23:36.171 --> 01:23:39.353]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:23:39.353 --> 01:23:40.714]  What have you got to lose?
[01:23:40.714 --> 01:23:44.437]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:23:44.437 --> 01:23:48.379]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:23:48.379 --> 01:23:48.719]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:23:52.802 --> 01:23:53.422]  That's 888-352-7726 888-352-7726 Friday
[01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:32.784]  I was driving to the local store to get some eggs, Christmas afternoon, and I heard about the underwear bomber and it just fit the M.O.
[01:24:32.784 --> 01:24:34.445]  of all the other fake attacks.
[01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:37.285]  In every case, they usher him on the plane, security does.
[01:24:37.285 --> 01:24:38.465]  They're always mentally ill.
[01:24:38.465 --> 01:24:41.166]  They always look like children or like they're out of their minds.
[01:24:41.166 --> 01:24:43.867]  I look at the photos of the underwear bomber.
[01:24:43.867 --> 01:24:48.128]  He looks like he's about 14 years old, is clearly a mental deficient.
[01:24:48.128 --> 01:24:49.128]  It's always the same!
[01:24:49.128 --> 01:24:49.628]  And then now,
[01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:58.935]  You have the FBI caught lying about everything, and you have the preparation to go into Yemen, into Sudan, into Somalia, all the new hype.
[01:24:58.935 --> 01:25:08.122]  I mean, we sent the Obama deception out six and a half months ago, seven months ago, that looked for staged events to get us into Africa.
[01:25:08.122 --> 01:25:18.210]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, again, national security expert, WayneMadsenReport.com, Wayne, getting into all the other evidence of this being a false flag.
[01:25:21.476 --> 01:25:24.197]  We have very odd connections.
[01:25:24.197 --> 01:25:27.198]  Let's look at this guy's father, the Underwear Bomber's father.
[01:25:27.198 --> 01:25:37.901]  He is one of the top banking officials tied to the top government officials of Nigeria, Umaru Mutalab.
[01:25:37.901 --> 01:25:47.964]  We do know now, it's being reported, that his son was traveling with a passport, but not a Nigerian passport, but an Italian passport.
[01:25:47.964 --> 01:25:49.524]  I just found out that
[01:25:50.143 --> 01:25:50.323]  I don't
[01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:12.556]  I don't know how many times this fascist government in Italy, this Estonian government has been caught several times involved in all kinds of false flag operations.
[01:26:12.556 --> 01:26:20.743]  They've had two of their former presidents come out and declassify that they staged hundreds of bombings, namely the Bologna bombing.
[01:26:20.743 --> 01:26:28.349]  Right, and we also know that, where did the Niger yellowcake, phony yellowcake Iranian documents come out of?
[01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:29.610]  They were laundered through Italy.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.382]  Uh, by media operations controlled by Berlusconi.
[01:26:35.382 --> 01:26:50.608]  So when you've got an Italian connection, you've got obvious Israeli connections, you've got now connections to India, which is a partner with the CIA and Mossad in various false flag operations, including their fingerprint, as you mentioned, are all over the Mumbai attacks.
[01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:57.864]  Now the Indian Press is reporting what I originally reported, that the Mumbai attacks were a false flag operation.
[01:26:57.864 --> 01:27:04.467]  Now the guy who was accused of that is recanting, saying his confession was forced.
[01:27:04.467 --> 01:27:06.708]  We do live in a wilderness of mirrors.
[01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:11.310]  We don't know, really, what's real and what isn't real.
[01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:17.593]  I think it's incumbent on everyone to do a little bit deeper digging on these stories and not listen to these
[01:27:18.072 --> 01:27:31.778]  These globiating people on these talking head networks that go on and on and on with this business about this is Al-Qaeda 2.0, this is, you know... Well, I mean, it's Kibono.
[01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:36.540]  They want to move into Africa and Southern Middle East, and so they're now doing this.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.201]  That was their agenda with AFRICOM and the rest of it.
[01:27:40.201 --> 01:27:42.822]  And speaking of Italy, Kibono.
[01:27:42.822 --> 01:27:43.663]  Who benefits?
[01:27:43.663 --> 01:27:46.964]  That's what... You always follow the money and the power, and you always find out who did it.
[01:27:48.035 --> 01:28:10.271]  That's right, and obviously we have this proxy war in Yemen right now between the Shias in the northern part of the country, the Houthi rebels, basically supported by Iran, and the Yemeni government, which is supported by, you know, here we go again, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United States.
[01:28:10.271 --> 01:28:17.056]  We saw this happen in the past with these strange alliances when Saddam Hussein launched his cut missiles
[01:28:17.598 --> 01:28:20.178]  Not only at Israel, but also at Saudi Arabia.
[01:28:20.178 --> 01:28:23.039]  He saw those two countries being in cahoots with one another.
[01:28:23.039 --> 01:28:32.041]  And we saw in the 80s, Mossad, the Saudi Arabians, the Egyptians, and the United States, as well as the Italians and others, helping out to go after the Russians.
[01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.581]  It's always the same groups teaming up.
[01:28:34.581 --> 01:28:45.343]  Well, it goes back to a group of intelligence agencies from going back in the 60s called the Safari Club, and that included the Turks, and we know there's all kinds of
[01:28:46.251 --> 01:29:00.816]  All kinds of information now coming out of Turkey about an attempt by the NATO-backed armed forces to overthrow the Turkish government of Prime Minister Erdogan, who's been a very big critic of what's been going on in Gaza.
[01:29:00.816 --> 01:29:07.699]  There's this group called Organikon, which is basically a Gladio-type operation.
[01:29:07.699 --> 01:29:08.839]  Gladio, of course, was
[01:29:09.475 --> 01:29:09.855]  It's simple!
[01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:40.547]  Absolutely.
[01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:41.128]  It's simple.
[01:29:41.128 --> 01:29:45.669]  The Empire stages terror attacks so they can attack their enemies.
[01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:51.171]  The Empire has to have an excuse, and they're staging these attacks to take our freedoms.
[01:29:51.171 --> 01:29:52.552]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.552 --> 01:29:55.093]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.093 --> 01:29:57.774]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.566 --> 01:30:05.873]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:05.873 --> 01:30:10.399]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.399 --> 01:30:12.682]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.682 --> 01:30:14.304]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.304 --> 01:30:15.346]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.566 --> 01:30:23.992]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:05.032]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.032 --> 01:31:05.953]  Number one.
[01:31:05.953 --> 01:31:09.375]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:10.236]  Number two.
[01:31:10.236 --> 01:31:15.119]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.119 --> 01:31:15.880]  It's true.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.423]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.723 --> 01:31:21.564]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.564 --> 01:31:25.147]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:29.070]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.850]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:32.612]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:36.295]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.295 --> 01:31:37.096]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.096 --> 01:31:41.239]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.239 --> 01:31:46.003]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.283 --> 01:31:50.445]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.445 --> 01:31:52.245]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:00.967 --> 01:32:03.988]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.988 --> 01:32:09.310]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:11.351]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:16.353]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.353 --> 01:32:17.554]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.554 --> 01:32:18.674]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.674 --> 01:32:20.555]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.555 --> 01:32:21.635]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.635 --> 01:32:23.836]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:25.177]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.177 --> 01:32:26.698]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.698 --> 01:32:27.758]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:32:27.898 --> 01:32:29.240]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.963]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:35.548]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.548 --> 01:32:39.373]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.373 --> 01:32:40.595]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.595 --> 01:32:41.496]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.496 --> 01:32:42.598]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.598 --> 01:32:43.359]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.359 --> 01:32:44.340]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:47.661]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.661 --> 01:32:49.442]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.442 --> 01:32:50.362]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:22.901 --> 01:33:26.944]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:26.944 --> 01:33:27.605]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:27.605 --> 01:33:28.505]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:28.505 --> 01:33:29.546]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:33:29.546 --> 01:33:29.806]  Eastern.
[01:33:29.806 --> 01:33:30.166]  We're here.
[01:33:30.166 --> 01:33:32.648]  I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:32.648 --> 01:33:35.070]  just a heads up for everybody.
[01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:38.953]  Which will be live tomorrow as well, going into the new year.
[01:33:38.953 --> 01:33:46.599]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, we are just so blessed to have this huge gallery of amazing guests.
[01:33:46.599 --> 01:33:48.320]  Do you know who our regular guests are, though?
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.163]  We have guests every day, or every couple days on this show that you'll never hear again.
[01:33:53.556 --> 01:33:56.957]  On specific articles, specific news, specific items.
[01:33:56.957 --> 01:34:00.198]  But we do have guests who come back every month.
[01:34:00.198 --> 01:34:03.318]  I don't know, we got 30, 40 of them.
[01:34:03.318 --> 01:34:07.539]  And they're people who are consistently proven right in hindsight.
[01:34:07.539 --> 01:34:08.820]  That's what I respect.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:13.141]  And that's who I want to associate with mentally.
[01:34:13.141 --> 01:34:14.641]  I want to hear what they have to say.
[01:34:14.641 --> 01:34:16.342]  I want to bounce information off them.
[01:34:16.342 --> 01:34:17.842]  I want to brainstorm.
[01:34:17.842 --> 01:34:19.202]  I want the truth.
[01:34:19.202 --> 01:34:20.943]  It's not about left and right.
[01:34:20.943 --> 01:34:21.903]  It's about the truth.
[01:34:23.007 --> 01:34:27.429]  It's about right and wrong, and it's hard to find the truth in this world.
[01:34:27.429 --> 01:34:32.812]  The controllers, the social engineers, have made it to where it's very hard to find the truth.
[01:34:32.812 --> 01:34:34.293]  And what I want is the truth.
[01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:35.914]  Does that mean I have the truth?
[01:34:35.914 --> 01:34:36.714]  No!
[01:34:36.714 --> 01:34:42.617]  But this radio show is a lot closer to the truth than anything else you're going to find out there.
[01:34:42.617 --> 01:34:48.701]  I challenge you, and we don't infight, we don't COINTELPRO, we don't fall for all the globalist tricks.
[01:34:49.738 --> 01:34:54.000]  We don't get into racial issues or religious fighting.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.382]  We don't get into all these distractions.
[01:34:56.382 --> 01:35:04.746]  We just cover the global power structure and what their agenda is, and then you make a decision about what you're gonna do about it.
[01:35:04.746 --> 01:35:05.947]  We do have suggestions.
[01:35:05.947 --> 01:35:07.408]  We do have issues we talk about.
[01:35:07.408 --> 01:35:11.290]  We have people on we don't even totally agree with.
[01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:14.191]  We want those different perspectives.
[01:35:14.191 --> 01:35:16.673]  I may not agree with someone about how they want to see the world,
[01:35:19.144 --> 01:35:26.967]  The direction they want to see the world go in, but if they've been accurate in the past about predictions and analysis, I want to still get their perspective.
[01:35:26.967 --> 01:35:36.571]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, finishing up, Wayne, anything on the false flag, what this heralds, all the talk about now Israel saying we may go ahead and hit them, the U.S.
[01:35:36.571 --> 01:35:45.254]  is coming in with, quote, Jerusalem Post headline, crippling sanctions, Ron Paul rightfully calls this an act of war, how would we like having our
[01:35:45.774 --> 01:36:01.139]  You know, our supplies cut off here, our economy destroyed, this empire just ladles out abuse, and then if Iran even dare criticize their evil, doesn't mean I'm in love with the corrupt system over there, it's just that what our empire is doing is wrong.
[01:36:01.139 --> 01:36:14.444]  Your take on that, and what you see in the new year, then I want to get into health care, the Democrats finally finding out what's really in it, where you see Obama's future, what kind of false flag you see in the new year, Wayne Madsen.
[01:36:15.216 --> 01:36:34.238]  Well, one thing that really amazes me is that after 9-11 we were told, oh, we need to have this revamped intelligence community, information's not being shared between the CIA and the FBI and the NSA and all these various three-letter alphabet soup agencies, and now what are we being told?
[01:36:34.238 --> 01:36:35.460]  The same thing.
[01:36:35.982 --> 01:36:37.823]  Information wasn't being shared.
[01:36:37.823 --> 01:36:46.368]  I mean, they must be thinking we're a bunch of fools to accept this explanation for why these things happen.
[01:36:46.368 --> 01:36:47.588]  No, they want more power.
[01:36:47.588 --> 01:36:58.554]  Every time, they take more of our rights and then they get even more power and now we've got to be prisoners on the plane and not have anything in our laps and not go to the bathroom and be body scanned and that won't be enough.
[01:36:58.554 --> 01:37:00.515]  Now they want shocker bracelets.
[01:37:00.515 --> 01:37:01.116]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:01.656 --> 01:37:10.602]  Well, you know, you mentioned Mike Springman, who reported what happened when he was the visa officer at the U.S.
[01:37:10.602 --> 01:37:20.388]  Embassy in Saudi Arabia, how these Saudis, known to be terrorists, were given, basically, he was being ordered by the CIA to give them visas to enter the country.
[01:37:20.388 --> 01:37:21.829]  Now we know that at the U.S.
[01:37:21.829 --> 01:37:29.974]  Embassy in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, this Mutalab's father, this wealthy guy who counts the president of Nigeria amongst his friends,
[01:37:30.768 --> 01:37:32.008]  We're good to go.
[01:37:52.647 --> 01:37:58.613]  I mean, Dubai is really the present-day Casablanca.
[01:37:58.613 --> 01:38:13.106]  If you remember the movie with Humphrey Bogart, the stock and trade for Dubai, other than dealing in smuggled items like diamonds, gold, and nuclear components, apparently, is intelligence gathering.
[01:38:14.036 --> 01:38:15.938]  Now we have this guy in Dubai.
[01:38:15.938 --> 01:38:21.562]  Remember who was at the American hospital in Dubai in July, right before them, you know, a couple months before 9-11?
[01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.023]  Osama bin Laden.
[01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:23.883]  Bin Laden, right.
[01:38:23.883 --> 01:38:26.805]  He's there, and of course, you know, we got the same thing.
[01:38:26.805 --> 01:38:30.528]  The French reported that, and then they, oh, you know, that was mistaken.
[01:38:30.528 --> 01:38:33.770]  No, there's no CIA agent, no bin Laden.
[01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:35.071]  None of them were in Dubai.
[01:38:35.071 --> 01:38:38.134]  Now we have this guy in Dubai.
[01:38:38.134 --> 01:38:40.455]  Where was all the U.S.
[01:38:40.455 --> 01:38:41.516]  intelligence agents?
[01:38:42.332 --> 01:38:48.856]  Swarm that city with the same report the father gave to the CIA Station Chief in Abuja.
[01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:50.317]  It did not happen.
[01:38:50.317 --> 01:39:01.725]  We're being told now that the embassy in Abuja sent what's called a Visa Viper cable to the State Department saying, hey, we had this guy come in, this prominent Nigerian businessman.
[01:39:01.725 --> 01:39:09.049]  He's worried about his son, who was on the terrorist watch list, but we're told he wasn't on the no-fly list.
[01:39:09.049 --> 01:39:11.251]  And now we're getting the same thing we heard about
[01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:18.093]  You know, prior to 9-11, the State Department wasn't the ones to make the call to put him on a no-fly list.
[01:39:18.093 --> 01:39:20.053]  That was the National Counterterrorism Center.
[01:39:20.053 --> 01:39:38.021]  And we're getting the same thing that we got a month and a half ago with the Fort Hood shooter, where for years he's talking about what he's going to do, supposedly, to Al-Qaeda, and it's the same cleric that runs everybody, and he's really emailing the CIA the whole time, and they stand down, and everybody sees other shooters and guns going off.
[01:39:38.021 --> 01:39:39.001]  I mean, it never ends!
[01:39:39.321 --> 01:39:46.545]  Right, and that guy was supposedly in Yemen, and now this guy, Mutalob, was supposedly in cahoots with the guy in Yemen.
[01:39:46.545 --> 01:39:53.569]  We supposedly killed the guy with a missile strike, and now they're saying, no, he never was killed.
[01:39:53.569 --> 01:39:57.851]  We had the Army Recruiting Center with the guy from Yemen blasting people in Arkansas.
[01:39:58.436 --> 01:39:59.016]  Exactly.
[01:39:59.016 --> 01:40:03.539]  I mean, this is just, as I say, this is a wilderness of mirrors.
[01:40:03.539 --> 01:40:06.401]  We can't believe anything about what these people say.
[01:40:06.401 --> 01:40:17.728]  And, you know, I kind of empathize with Obama somewhat, because even though he's the president, can you imagine the kind of, you know, just total garbage he's getting from these jerks on a daily basis?
[01:40:17.728 --> 01:40:19.789]  I mean, he's got this guy John Brennan as his
[01:40:20.245 --> 01:40:25.627]  As his National Security Advisor, Deputy National Security Advisor on Terrorism.
[01:40:25.627 --> 01:40:34.810]  It was Brennan who his people were rifling through Obama's passport file at the State Department during the election campaign.
[01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:44.993]  No, clearly he is a kept man reading off a teleprompter surrounded by a nexus of intelligence agencies driving the entire policy of our country.
[01:40:44.993 --> 01:40:46.734]  We are a captured nation.
[01:40:47.395 --> 01:41:00.519]  Absolutely, and as I've reported, I believe that Obama has his own past with the Central Intelligence Agency, especially when he was traveling on an Indonesian passport under the name Barry Satoro to Pakistan.
[01:41:00.519 --> 01:41:08.761]  At the same time, his professor at Columbia, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was basically building up the anti-Soviet Mujahideen.
[01:41:08.761 --> 01:41:11.882]  That's right, he's got an absolute spook pedigree.
[01:41:12.583 --> 01:41:13.384]  Absolutely.
[01:41:13.384 --> 01:41:15.485]  You know, you heard about military brats.
[01:41:15.485 --> 01:41:26.912]  I'm beginning to call this guy a Langley brat because I think it's quite clear his mother was working for the agency under cover of Ford Foundation that young Barack was working for them.
[01:41:26.912 --> 01:41:33.056]  They, of course, his mom and dad met at a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii in 1960.
[01:41:33.056 --> 01:41:35.478]  Remember, this is at the height of the Cold War.
[01:41:35.478 --> 01:41:38.319]  Yeah, a Russian language class.
[01:41:38.319 --> 01:41:38.860]  Exactly.
[01:41:39.659 --> 01:41:42.620]  And then he goes back, the father goes back to Kenya.
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:48.303]  He's actually brought over on a Kennedy Foundation grant, and this is at a time when the U.S.
[01:41:48.303 --> 01:41:56.547]  was actively recruiting people because all these colonies were getting their independence in Africa, especially the English-speaking colonies.
[01:41:56.983 --> 01:41:59.405]  We and the British were recruiting people.
[01:41:59.405 --> 01:42:02.828]  They call them the Renaissance Generation of African leaders.
[01:42:02.828 --> 01:42:04.049]  Barack Obama Sr.
[01:42:04.049 --> 01:42:05.490]  was one of these individuals.
[01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:08.773]  Many others went to Britain where they were recruited into the M.I.C.
[01:42:08.773 --> 01:42:11.215]  Well, Wayne, in the time we've got left, I can talk to you for 10 hours.
[01:42:11.215 --> 01:42:12.296]  I know you've got to go soon.
[01:42:12.296 --> 01:42:13.758]  In the time we've got left,
[01:42:14.438 --> 01:42:17.199]  What does this signal then for foreign policy?
[01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:23.942]  Clearly, just from a layman's perspective, we're seeing a whole new kickoff like we saw at the start of 9-11.
[01:42:23.942 --> 01:42:32.446]  I mean, this has all the makings that they're getting ready to go to a whole new level, and that more false flags, bigger false flags, are in the pipeline.
[01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:36.128]  Well, I think so, and you mentioned how this is going to affect travel.
[01:42:36.793 --> 01:42:42.759]  They obviously now, the Schiphol Airport has announced it's going to be mandatory for all U.S.
[01:42:42.759 --> 01:42:45.921]  bound passengers to go through these millimeter wave detections.
[01:42:45.921 --> 01:42:50.886]  They can actually look under your clothing and the image is basically of your naked body.
[01:42:50.886 --> 01:42:57.812]  Now I see this Peter King, this really horrible congressman from Long Island, he's the ranking Republican on the
[01:42:58.103 --> 01:42:59.705]  Homeland Security Committee
[01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:09.751]  They want to make us submit to them.
[01:43:09.751 --> 01:43:14.573]  In fact, I've read that it's really a biometric 360 scan they then use for passive millimeter wave readers.
[01:43:30.481 --> 01:43:33.062]  Right, and I mean, just this mere thought of putting people through this type of
[01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:52.051]  I mean, you might as well take your clothes off.
[01:43:52.051 --> 01:43:54.392]  Now, here's the other thing that I see coming.
[01:43:54.392 --> 01:43:58.494]  You know, there's going to be an ability to capture those videos, too.
[01:43:58.494 --> 01:44:01.175]  Can you imagine when this stuff starts to appear?
[01:44:01.175 --> 01:44:03.516]  You know, we always see the paparazzi photos.
[01:44:03.516 --> 01:44:03.957]  Can you imagine?
[01:44:03.957 --> 01:44:05.297]  Everything gets leaked.
[01:44:05.297 --> 01:44:06.998]  I mean, everything gets released.
[01:44:06.998 --> 01:44:08.519]  Absolutely.
[01:44:08.519 --> 01:44:14.982]  They're going to release Wayne Madsen and Alex Jones, and they can all laugh at our Johnson size, and it'll be real funny.
[01:44:15.563 --> 01:44:26.787]  Well, and then the other thing, of course, you know, you've got perverts like Peter King, who supports the, you know, the church every time, you know, it's hammered for pedophilia.
[01:44:26.787 --> 01:44:36.911]  You know, I mean, I can imagine this guy getting his own, you know, pipeline of captured images from National Airport here in Washington.
[01:44:36.911 --> 01:44:41.073]  You know, I mean, this is just perversion.
[01:44:42.029 --> 01:44:43.470]  At a very grand scale.
[01:44:43.470 --> 01:45:03.064]  And obviously, this was... I also would point out that the company that had the security both in Amsterdam, in Schiphol, and at Charles de Gaulle, where Richard Reed, the shoe bomber, boarded, with the same chemical in his shoes that this guy had in his undershorts, is ICTS.
[01:45:03.064 --> 01:45:06.066]  Who makes up the leadership of ICTS?
[01:45:06.659 --> 01:45:09.240]  X is really Mossad official.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:14.723]  You mean they even used the host country explosive instead of going and getting their enemies explosives?
[01:45:14.723 --> 01:45:16.204]  They're that open?
[01:45:16.204 --> 01:45:21.467]  Right, and the thing is, now who do you find on the board of directors of ICPS?
[01:45:21.467 --> 01:45:25.229]  Norman Mineta, the transportation secretary during 9-11.
[01:45:27.375 --> 01:45:29.877]  It just gets more insane by the millisecond.
[01:45:29.877 --> 01:45:32.698]  Shifting gears, Wayne Madsen, health care.
[01:45:32.698 --> 01:45:36.080]  All these different Democrats, Howard Dean, everybody are admitting.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:42.644]  You read the health care bill, it's a giant rip-off to the insurance companies and the banks that own them.
[01:45:42.644 --> 01:45:51.690]  It raises taxes, cuts health care, and different senators are having 30-plus drops in their polls going into their elections.
[01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:54.092]  The Democrats know this is suicide.
[01:45:54.992 --> 01:46:00.054]  We'll get a bunch of neocons who'll suddenly forget how much they didn't like healthcare as soon as they get in.
[01:46:00.054 --> 01:46:01.155]  Watch!
[01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:03.555]  I mean, this is a disaster!
[01:46:03.555 --> 01:46:05.436]  Why are the Democrats doing this?
[01:46:05.436 --> 01:46:07.637]  Is it because they're being blackmailed?
[01:46:07.637 --> 01:46:15.460]  Well, I think part of it is that, and the other part is the Democratic Party, when all is said and done, is really under the control of the Democratic Leadership Council.
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:24.564]  These are the big-pocketed money people that decided, you know, let's get the Democrats on our side, just like, you know, we've got the Republicans lined up.
[01:46:25.223 --> 01:46:30.885]  Uh, so it doesn't matter who the president is, we always get, you know, see that our agenda is advanced.
[01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:32.946]  And, uh, you know, who are the DLC?
[01:46:32.946 --> 01:46:37.807]  The DLC are people like, um, uh, Rahm Emanuel, the Chief of Staff.
[01:46:37.807 --> 01:46:47.170]  And I think it's very interesting, you know, his brother, Zeke Emanuel, was brought in from the National Institutes of Health to be an advisor on healthcare policy at the White House.
[01:46:47.170 --> 01:46:49.811]  And he's given speeches calling for health rationing.
[01:46:50.390 --> 01:47:08.340]  All right, and you know, I see Jane Hampshire of Firedog Lake has teamed up with Grover Norquist to demand an investigation of Rahm Emanuel for what kind of stunt duggery he was engaged with when he was appointed by President Clinton to the board of Freddie Mac, and we know about what happened to Freddie Mac later.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:19.387]  I would also like to see people team up, like the left and right has teamed up on Rahm and Freddie Mac, on the role Zeke Emanuel played in coming up with this
[01:47:20.606 --> 01:47:21.106]  I think so.
[01:47:34.192 --> 01:47:35.573]  We'll take the banking bill.
[01:47:35.573 --> 01:47:40.377]  Bloomberg's reporting over $4 trillion in other goodies for the banks than that.
[01:47:40.377 --> 01:47:43.819]  I mean, they're acting like this country isn't going to exist anymore.
[01:47:43.819 --> 01:47:48.943]  They are just stealing with both hands, both feet.
[01:47:48.943 --> 01:47:54.367]  I mean, Wayne, am I right in saying that government has just gone hog-wild crazy?
[01:47:55.216 --> 01:47:57.818]  Well, yeah, and then, you know, Obama promised change.
[01:47:57.818 --> 01:48:05.886]  I would point out that there's been a demonstration at the Whirlpool plant in Evansville, Indiana.
[01:48:05.886 --> 01:48:08.208]  That company's moving its factory to Mexico.
[01:48:08.208 --> 01:48:13.613]  A thousand people are going to lose their jobs in Indiana and Evansville at this plant.
[01:48:13.613 --> 01:48:19.078]  Why is Obama talking about stimulus money when he could have picked up the phone to the chairman of Whirlpool and said,
[01:48:19.488 --> 01:48:22.270]  You move those Johns to Mexico at your own risk.
[01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:25.051]  I will tax the bejesus out of you.
[01:48:25.051 --> 01:48:30.694]  4 billion of the GM bailout went to move the factories to Eastern Europe, China, and Brazil.
[01:48:30.694 --> 01:48:32.535]  I mean, you can't make this up!
[01:48:32.535 --> 01:48:33.316]  Right.
[01:48:33.316 --> 01:48:37.178]  And you know, Indiana went for Obama the first time.
[01:48:37.178 --> 01:48:41.200]  They voted Democratic since 1964 for Lyndon Johnson, but I doubt
[01:48:42.204 --> 01:48:50.772]  I really feel that what I'm hearing more and more is that Obama is going to be facing at least one, if not two, primary challengers in 2012.
[01:48:50.772 --> 01:48:57.718]  And very soon we're going to see these people start to sniff around in Iowa, the first caucus state.
[01:48:59.336 --> 01:49:03.577]  Well, that's what I see.
[01:49:03.577 --> 01:49:10.659]  I see absolute devastation in the next election and then the next election after that, the big national election.
[01:49:10.659 --> 01:49:12.799]  Total annihilation of the Democrats.
[01:49:12.799 --> 01:49:14.220]  But then what happens?
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.440]  The Republicans will even have a shorter honeymoon.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.740]  They'll keep stealing.
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.241]  Is that when the revolution comes?
[01:49:19.241 --> 01:49:22.942]  Is when we put the Republicans in and they even are worse than Obama?
[01:49:22.942 --> 01:49:24.282]  Is that when people finally wake up?
[01:49:24.943 --> 01:49:37.313]  Well I think 2012 and maybe 10, I'm not sure about 10 because it's a congressional election, but in 12 I think we may see one of those rare times where a third party candidate could come on very strong.
[01:49:37.313 --> 01:49:37.953]  We saw that in 92.
[01:49:39.096 --> 01:49:47.103]  With Ross Perot, you know, everyone was disgusted with old man Bush, and they didn't quite trust Bill Clinton, let's face it.
[01:49:47.103 --> 01:49:49.545]  And for good reason, we found out later why.
[01:49:49.545 --> 01:49:55.449]  But I think it's one of those rare times when we see a third-party potential gain steam.
[01:49:55.449 --> 01:49:59.493]  And I really believe that whether it's, you know, Jesse Ventura or Dennis Kucinich or
[01:50:00.023 --> 01:50:03.325]  Any of these people, I think we're going to see a third party challenger.
[01:50:03.325 --> 01:50:11.871]  I think this third party challenger is going to potentially do very well and pose a threat to the ruling duopoly of the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:17.435]  Whatever happens, we're in for a wild ride.
[01:50:17.435 --> 01:50:19.536]  We'll talk to Wayne Madsen again in the New Year.
[01:50:19.536 --> 01:50:29.760]  Wayne Madsen Report, or TheWayneMadsenReport.com, or just Google Wayne Madsen, and you'll find his site right there, and all of his great writing and reports.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.501]  Wayne, thank you for spending so much time with us.
[01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:41.224]  In closing, is it safe to say, pun intended, that the underwear bombing plot blew up in their face, and that it's really not going well for them?
[01:50:41.846 --> 01:50:46.487]  Well, I remember when we had the Richard Reed, the shoe bomber, we all had to take off our shoes.
[01:50:46.487 --> 01:50:50.668]  I don't know what that means now that we all have to take off our underwear when we board a plane.
[01:50:50.668 --> 01:50:51.549]  Yeah, that's the message.
[01:50:51.549 --> 01:50:52.609]  We're going to body scan you.
[01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:54.109]  Next is the Taser Bracelet.
[01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:55.470]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much.
[01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:56.730]  Have a great New Year.
[01:50:56.730 --> 01:50:57.210]  Same to you.
[01:50:57.210 --> 01:50:58.311]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[01:50:58.311 --> 01:50:59.111]  Vaya con Dios.
[01:50:59.111 --> 01:50:59.711]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.192 --> 01:51:02.493]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.493 --> 01:51:08.077]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.077 --> 01:51:13.100]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:18.684]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.684 --> 01:51:23.367]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.885 --> 01:51:31.009]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.009 --> 01:51:32.129]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.129 --> 01:51:34.891]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.891 --> 01:51:38.813]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.813 --> 01:51:42.015]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.015 --> 01:51:45.016]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[01:51:45.277 --> 01:51:45.517]  Remember,
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:04.582]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.582 --> 01:52:08.484]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.484 --> 01:52:12.206]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:12.206 --> 01:52:18.609]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine
[01:52:22.551 --> 01:52:22.811]  I think so.

[01:52:54.598 --> 01:52:55.938]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[01:53:03.962 --> 01:53:05.803]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[01:53:05.803 --> 01:53:07.584]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[01:53:07.584 --> 01:53:11.567]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:20.713]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[01:53:21.113 --> 01:53:26.555]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[01:53:26.555 --> 01:53:35.638]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 salpon metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[01:53:35.638 --> 01:53:38.659]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[01:53:55.067 --> 01:53:55.267]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[01:54:29.670 --> 01:54:49.678]  By the way, you really can't do this justice, but I want to do a tribute to George Washington coming up in the last hour near the end of the show today because we need to remember who the real John Wayne is and we need to know that our enemies are fully aware of who George Washington is.
[01:54:49.678 --> 01:54:51.478]  That's why you never hear about him.
[01:54:51.478 --> 01:54:53.139]  Nothing about George Washington is taught.
[01:54:56.590 --> 01:55:09.821]  I'll tell you, it was even badder as they cornerly talk about somebody who's tough stuff is Andrew Jackson, but George Washington was the real deal.
[01:55:09.821 --> 01:55:17.268]  True Americana, and to praise him is like iron claws across a chalkboard.
[01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:24.669]  It sends our enemies into fits of rage.
[01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:36.118]  And last time I was reading quotes by George Washington, it would be better that the entire continent be drenched in blood than we live in tyranny as slaves.
[01:55:36.118 --> 01:55:37.279]  Ooh, it's so radical.
[01:55:37.279 --> 01:55:38.420]  No, it's not.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.462]  We're not going to be your slaves, New World Order.
[01:55:41.547 --> 01:55:58.197]  And the biggest thing with this terrorism is we're being caught to nanny and be afraid and see men in uniforms marching around as our gods, as our saviors with their M16s, meanwhile the terrorists are being escorted on board the planes by security.
[01:55:58.197 --> 01:56:03.500]  All of this, the troops being put on the streets, all of it is for you!
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:06.682]  George Washington knew it, you need to know it.
[01:56:06.682 --> 01:56:08.003]  I stand with George Washington.
[01:56:11.357 --> 01:56:15.379]  I stand with the Founding Fathers, not with the truly archaic tyranny.
[01:56:15.379 --> 01:56:18.901]  They were the true revolutionaries of liberty and freedom.
[01:56:18.901 --> 01:56:23.203]  George Washington handed over his power when they wanted him to be king.
[01:56:23.203 --> 01:56:24.583]  They said, we want you to be king.
[01:56:24.583 --> 01:56:28.525]  A sizable group, after they beat the British, wanted him to be king.
[01:56:28.525 --> 01:56:31.807]  The British wanted to make a deal with him to make him king.
[01:56:31.807 --> 01:56:36.109]  And that's why King George III, when he heard that George Washington refused it, said,
[01:56:37.219 --> 01:56:46.061]  Quote, George Washington is the greatest man in the world because nobody ever turned down power like that!
[01:56:46.061 --> 01:56:48.541]  George Washington's the real deal!
[01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:54.202]  And that's why the New World Order doesn't like him!
[01:56:54.202 --> 01:56:57.903]  They don't want you to have models of true leadership, true heroes.
[01:56:57.903 --> 01:57:01.104]  They want you to think it's some stupid football player or golfer.
[01:57:02.403 --> 01:57:06.266]  Or even a Hollywood person, who cares at the end of the day?
[01:57:06.266 --> 01:57:09.569]  It's what people do and what they stand up for.
[01:57:09.569 --> 01:57:25.282]  Doesn't mean you're perfect, doesn't mean that you have all the answers, but it means that your core, you're a good person who's honorable and tells the truth.
[01:57:25.282 --> 01:57:31.067]  So we're gonna be covering that coming up in the last hour of this radio transmission today.
[01:57:32.489 --> 01:57:38.974]  I'm also going to cover The Decade of Tyranny, written by Steve Watson and Paul Watson.
[01:57:38.974 --> 01:57:40.815]  It's a key article you should send out to everybody.
[01:57:40.815 --> 01:57:46.199]  We need to have a year in review as well for 2009.
[01:57:46.199 --> 01:57:57.348]  Before I end this hour, again, I just want to encourage the listeners to remember we've got the holiday specials going a little bit into January, where you can get a lot of free films like Reflections and Warnings, The Obama Deception, and others.
[01:57:57.348 --> 01:57:59.910]  When you buy, follow the Republic.
[01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:00.911]  Or you can get a free t-shirt.
[01:58:02.165 --> 01:58:02.585]  We're good to go.
[01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.890]  We got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up.
[01:58:25.890 --> 01:58:31.812]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv here in just a moment.
[01:58:31.812 --> 01:58:39.393]  We're going to get into the economy, gold, the dollar, the police state, government-run health care, and a lot more.
[01:58:39.393 --> 01:58:42.554]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.554 --> 01:58:45.934]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:55.976]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:55.976 --> 01:59:00.502]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.502 --> 01:59:02.785]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.785 --> 01:59:04.407]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.407 --> 01:59:05.449]  There is a solution.

[01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:58.951]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.478 --> 02:00:10.300]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:11.900]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.461]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.461 --> 02:00:17.642]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.642 --> 02:00:24.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.944 --> 02:00:25.865]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:25.865 --> 02:00:29.646]  We've reached the halfway point in this Wednesday.
[02:00:31.749 --> 02:00:33.070]  December 30, 2009 edition.
[02:00:33.070 --> 02:00:39.977]  We're simulcasting now the third and fourth hour live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:39.977 --> 02:00:46.703]  I'm going to go over the Decade of Tyranny, an article written by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and myself at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:46.703 --> 02:00:56.232]  In the last hour, I'm also going to spend a segment or so reading some quotes by George Washington.
[02:00:57.222 --> 02:01:03.766]  And talking about why King George III called him the greatest man in the world.
[02:01:03.766 --> 02:01:07.149]  Why did King George III call him the greatest man in the world?
[02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:11.191]  Because he turned down the power when he was offered kingship.
[02:01:11.191 --> 02:01:13.493]  Heck, the British wanted a king to deal with.
[02:01:13.493 --> 02:01:16.515]  They were just going to set him up as a new house of nobility.
[02:01:16.515 --> 02:01:17.316]  And he said no!
[02:01:17.316 --> 02:01:19.197]  And he didn't want to be president.
[02:01:20.492 --> 02:01:23.855]  Now, no one in history has acted and behaved like that.
[02:01:23.855 --> 02:01:26.437]  That's why our country had the best start ever.
[02:01:26.437 --> 02:01:31.601]  This great engine of liberty has been turned into an engine of tyranny.
[02:01:31.601 --> 02:01:43.591]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, former head of policy, the father of Reaganomics, headed up the Treasury, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, best-selling author, the latest edition is out, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[02:01:44.151 --> 02:01:44.832]  Okay, Alex, I think that
[02:02:13.234 --> 02:02:23.717]  The greatest threat that we face is the ongoing destruction of the United States Constitution and our civil liberties.
[02:02:23.717 --> 02:02:41.401]  They're now holding, you know, American citizens in indefinite detention, denying American citizens habeas corpus to protest, and they're doing it without any evidence presented and without really any
[02:02:41.932 --> 02:02:47.535]  They orchestrate the most blatantly false kinds of charges.
[02:02:47.535 --> 02:02:52.857]  Just take the case of this Fahd Hashmi.
[02:02:52.857 --> 02:02:54.758]  Now, he's an American citizen.
[02:02:54.758 --> 02:02:58.220]  I think he was in New York.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:08.785]  He was a known Muslim activist in behalf of civil rights for Muslims.
[02:03:10.075 --> 02:03:11.516]  He was not a terrorist.
[02:03:11.516 --> 02:03:15.237]  He's not involved in the event.
[02:03:15.237 --> 02:03:20.499]  He's been arrested in hell now for, I think, two and a half years.
[02:03:20.499 --> 02:03:21.479]  I can't remember.
[02:03:21.479 --> 02:03:22.920]  Yeah, it's almost three.
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.241]  Three years, okay.
[02:03:25.241 --> 02:03:36.925]  Because, allegedly, someone he knew stayed in his apartment, and allegedly this person was collecting up ponchos and socks.
[02:03:39.228 --> 02:03:44.775]  I mean, the whole thing sounds far-fetched.
[02:03:44.775 --> 02:03:51.202]  Why would somebody be trying to take socks and ponchos to the Taliban from New York?
[02:03:54.051 --> 02:03:55.612]  As if they can't buy it in Pakistan.
[02:03:55.612 --> 02:03:59.675]  A lot of the ponchos and socks that come here are from Pakistan, India, and China.
[02:03:59.675 --> 02:04:11.004]  But on top of that, someone claims with no evidence, three or four deep, that maybe you let somebody stay with you who might have done something wrong and you disappear into a black hole as a U.S.
[02:04:11.004 --> 02:04:12.184]  citizen.
[02:04:12.184 --> 02:04:13.585]  That's exactly what's happened.
[02:04:13.585 --> 02:04:15.947]  You summed it up good for me.
[02:04:15.947 --> 02:04:22.352]  I just finished reading the uncensored version of Alexander Bozeman's In the First Circle.
[02:04:23.394 --> 02:04:26.556]  Uh, about the Stalinist camps and legal system.
[02:04:26.556 --> 02:04:34.541]  And if you read that book and then you read Chris Hedges' description of the American legal system, there's no difference.
[02:04:34.541 --> 02:04:38.924]  What's happening to us is exactly what was ongoing in Stalinist Russia.
[02:04:38.924 --> 02:04:41.686]  People are just picked up and locked away.
[02:04:41.686 --> 02:04:43.006]  They just disappear.
[02:04:43.006 --> 02:04:44.087]  Well, stay there, sir.
[02:04:44.087 --> 02:04:45.148]  I want you to take your time.
[02:04:45.148 --> 02:04:49.911]  Let's get into Sholts and Neatson's first circle of hell.
[02:04:49.911 --> 02:04:51.372]  Gulag Archipelago author.
[02:04:52.557 --> 02:04:54.102]  Nobel Prize winner.
[02:04:54.102 --> 02:04:56.248]  Somebody who actually deserved it.
[02:04:56.248 --> 02:04:58.575]  What, nine years in a gulag or was it eight years?
[02:05:00.728 --> 02:05:04.831]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:05:04.831 --> 02:05:07.712]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:05:07.712 --> 02:05:09.794]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:05:12.035 --> 02:05:13.696]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:06:00.492 --> 02:06:05.035]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.035 --> 02:06:05.935]  Number one.
[02:06:05.935 --> 02:06:09.378]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.378 --> 02:06:10.238]  Number two.
[02:06:10.238 --> 02:06:15.121]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.121 --> 02:06:15.862]  It's true.
[02:06:15.862 --> 02:06:20.745]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.745 --> 02:06:21.205]  Number three.
[02:06:21.545 --> 02:06:25.148]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.148 --> 02:06:29.852]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.852 --> 02:06:32.614]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.614 --> 02:06:35.956]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:37.077 --> 02:06:41.220]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:46.284]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.284 --> 02:06:50.447]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.447 --> 02:06:52.248]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:02.165 --> 02:07:06.126]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.126 --> 02:07:14.987]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:14.987 --> 02:07:19.608]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.608 --> 02:07:30.430]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:31.050 --> 02:07:40.572]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.572 --> 02:07:45.994]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:45.994 --> 02:07:53.495]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.495 --> 02:07:56.236]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:06.583]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.583 --> 02:08:13.325]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.325 --> 02:08:17.146]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:17.146 --> 02:08:23.348]  Then I'll do something that the collectivist and big government criminals will certainly hate, like nails on a chalkboard.
[02:08:23.348 --> 02:08:25.649]  We're going to talk about George Washington some today.
[02:08:27.924 --> 02:08:36.829]  And get into eco-spies with the new Apple iPhone application called EcoSnoop, spying on your neighbors and others.
[02:08:36.829 --> 02:08:38.349]  So that is coming up in the last hour.
[02:08:38.349 --> 02:08:43.092]  Okay, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a lot I want to talk about with the economy with him, top economist.
[02:08:43.832 --> 02:08:47.716]  Listed by many major publications in the top 10 economists in the world.
[02:08:47.716 --> 02:08:53.041]  I want to obviously pick your brain going into the new year about your perspectives, your view on that.
[02:08:53.041 --> 02:08:58.646]  Your last prediction, very, very accurate, that you thought the dollar would go back up in late December, early January.
[02:08:58.646 --> 02:09:01.529]  As the carry trade that's been reversed back into the U.S.
[02:09:01.529 --> 02:09:03.110]  was activated, that has happened.
[02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:04.632]  So we want to pick your brain on that.
[02:09:04.632 --> 02:09:06.253]  But you were talking about the Kafka-esque
[02:09:06.994 --> 02:09:20.290]  Situation where American citizens are arrested and held, their lawyers are spied on, with no evidence, no charges, or no evidence to be charged, and this is the new precedent.
[02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:22.212]  You said you were reading one of Shultz and Eatson's books.
[02:09:24.401 --> 02:09:41.007]  And that it mirrors what's now happening, and I've talked to reporters from Eastern Europe, from Russia, and they say, look, we don't like communism and tyranny, and we know we're not perfect, but we were at the G20, and we saw women attacked with police dogs for coming out of stores with grocery sacks.
[02:09:41.007 --> 02:09:44.048]  We saw women knocked off their bikes at the university.
[02:09:44.048 --> 02:09:48.189]  We saw families hit with sound cannons in their neighborhoods.
[02:09:48.189 --> 02:09:52.551]  We saw your police, and this is really bad.
[02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:53.391]  What happened to you?
[02:09:53.911 --> 02:09:57.673]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, break it down.
[02:09:57.673 --> 02:10:13.243]  Well, Alex, my book, Carrying a Good Intention, documents how we've lost the protected features in law over time because various single-interest groups have demonized some devil or the other.
[02:10:13.243 --> 02:10:15.544]  They wanted to get that devil at all costs.
[02:10:15.544 --> 02:10:21.008]  So if the law was in the way or civil liberty or the Constitution, they just overrode it.
[02:10:21.008 --> 02:10:22.088]  And then, of course, we had
[02:10:23.268 --> 02:10:31.491]  9-11, and the War on Terror, and the Bush-Cheney people used that to destroy what was left of the Liberties.
[02:10:31.491 --> 02:10:47.216]  And we now have the situation we were talking about, which is Fahd Hashmi, an American citizen, and he's being held in violation of all known American legal procedure of the Constitution, and nobody's doing anything about it.
[02:10:47.216 --> 02:10:52.238]  The bar associations are silent, the law schools are silent, the constitutional lawyers are
[02:10:53.667 --> 02:10:57.508]  As far as I can tell, not even the ACLU is on this case.
[02:10:57.508 --> 02:11:09.212]  So we now have a situation where American citizens have no more rights and are treated exactly as people in the Stalinist system were treated.
[02:11:09.212 --> 02:11:23.117]  And one of the points that Chris Hedges makes, he says that it's obvious that this treatment will not be reserved for the state of alleged terrorists or even for Muslims.
[02:11:24.079 --> 02:11:27.120]  Because it's going to be applied to everybody.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:38.163]  Anyone who comes across as disruptive or subversive or a critic of the system or the government is going to be treated this way.
[02:11:38.163 --> 02:11:41.964]  And that's, of course, exactly what happened in Stalinist Russia.
[02:11:41.964 --> 02:11:45.646]  And Hedges says, he reports, that already
[02:11:47.461 --> 02:12:00.649]  Radical activist type in the environmental movement, the anti-globalization movement, the anti-nuclear movement, and the sustainable agriculture movement.
[02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:06.632]  These people are already being placed in the same special detention facilities.
[02:12:08.671 --> 02:12:24.384]  That's right, there's already special facilities in Montana, Wyoming, Texas and other areas where they're not allowed to see their families, they don't get due process, they're just held and it's admitted that they're torturing these people
[02:12:24.804 --> 02:12:29.846]  Now, and this is the real operation, not the distraction that's Abu Ghraib.
[02:12:29.846 --> 02:12:40.091]  And we have the constitutional lawyer, Obama, caught red-handed expanding rendition and secret arrest in black sites all over Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
[02:12:41.291 --> 02:12:48.557]  And so, it's just so hard to believe this is going on, much less not getting more attention.
[02:12:48.557 --> 02:12:59.325]  And then we have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, when really this whole system's being set up for libertarians, conservatives, anti-fellow reserve people, gun owners, returning vets.
[02:12:59.325 --> 02:13:07.130]  And so, just like Hitler, they're beta testing it on a group it's popular to strip the rights of, Muslims.
[02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:09.092]  But really, it's designed for everybody.
[02:13:09.525 --> 02:13:12.147]  Right, that's exactly it.
[02:13:12.147 --> 02:13:14.308]  People just don't realize that.
[02:13:14.308 --> 02:13:17.450]  You know, in Stalinist Russia, no one was safe.
[02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:21.452]  Not even the highest members of the party itself.
[02:13:21.452 --> 02:13:23.213]  Not even the heads of the secret police.
[02:13:23.213 --> 02:13:24.094]  No one was safe.
[02:13:24.094 --> 02:13:25.835]  No one had any right.
[02:13:25.835 --> 02:13:34.180]  Anybody could be picked up and just simply disappear and subjected to the most horrible treatment.
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:38.182]  I mean, it's just unbelievable how people were treated and are being treated
[02:13:38.638 --> 02:13:44.942]  Well, I think this is the most serious thing that we face.
[02:13:44.942 --> 02:13:47.704]  And the fact that the courts accept it.
[02:13:47.704 --> 02:13:53.107]  For example, recently the Supreme Court rejected one of the Guantanamo torture cases.
[02:13:53.107 --> 02:13:58.410]  This was reported by Reuters earlier this month, around the middle of the month.
[02:13:58.410 --> 02:14:06.715]  And they were four British citizens who were tortured in Guantanamo, and the Supreme Court
[02:14:08.985 --> 02:14:10.486]  Appeal out of hand.
[02:14:10.486 --> 02:14:14.408]  There's another recent case that, you know, Andy Worthington is good.
[02:14:14.408 --> 02:14:15.989]  He reports a lot of these.
[02:14:15.989 --> 02:14:33.878]  He's reported another one where a federal district judge, Thomas Hogan, has just simply dismissed the case of a 28-year-old Yemeni who said he could be
[02:14:34.426 --> 02:14:38.609]  He's held indefinitely because of his alleged connection with Al Qaeda.
[02:14:38.609 --> 02:14:44.592]  So we see that the federal judges have acquiesced.
[02:14:44.592 --> 02:14:50.156]  Actually, in Nazi Germany, the judges stood up to the government a lot longer.
[02:14:50.156 --> 02:14:57.160]  In fact, they had to set up a second court system to bypass German law.
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:58.561]  Well, here we don't even have to do that.
[02:14:58.561 --> 02:15:00.863]  The federal judges just fall in with it.
[02:15:01.897 --> 02:15:03.438]  Apparently even the Supreme Court.
[02:15:03.438 --> 02:15:14.745]  So it looks like the rights of Americans are simply gone, and yet we still have all this verbiage, this vocabulary of democracy, freedom.
[02:15:15.333 --> 02:15:15.533]  That's it.
[02:15:15.533 --> 02:15:16.074]  I'm afraid that's it.
[02:15:16.074 --> 02:15:17.915]  And the Americans just don't seem to catch on.
[02:15:17.915 --> 02:15:19.697]  They just don't seem to be able to
[02:15:43.237 --> 02:15:48.700]  Well, that's like CPS and the family courts taking people's children without due process.
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:50.560]  They just do what they want.
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.201]  That's right.
[02:15:52.201 --> 02:15:58.704]  I don't think there are any people anywhere that are less protected than the American people.
[02:15:58.704 --> 02:16:03.446]  The law no longer protects an American in his own country.
[02:16:03.446 --> 02:16:09.348]  And I think that, you know, we try to make a big deal out of human rights in China.
[02:16:09.946 --> 02:16:12.769]  Well, I actually think they get better treatment than we do.
[02:16:12.769 --> 02:16:15.452]  They certainly have a much smaller percentage of their people than we do.
[02:16:16.158 --> 02:16:17.479]  Well, I'm no fan of Iran.
[02:16:17.479 --> 02:16:20.441]  I mean, most government becomes corrupt, but the Founding Fathers knew that.
[02:16:20.441 --> 02:16:25.765]  But, they're not taking over my life, and it shows police bumping people with cars.
[02:16:25.765 --> 02:16:32.810]  I was in New York in 2004 and watched the police running over people with cars, horses, and mopeds.
[02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:35.892]  You know, they kill people with the Red Sox game.
[02:16:35.892 --> 02:16:37.433]  They kill people all the time.
[02:16:37.433 --> 02:16:42.597]  And Iran's killed a few people, and I think it's wrong, but they are CIA-funded shooting police.
[02:16:43.237 --> 02:16:45.640]  I guess it's just the hubris and stupidity of our population.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:53.249]  They're like the people in 1984, you know, they're all big brother and tell them something.
[02:17:05.319 --> 02:17:06.299]  Well, that's another issue.
[02:17:06.299 --> 02:17:07.280]  You've read Schultz and Eatson.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:08.100]  You've studied history.
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:11.021]  You've written and edited for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:17:11.021 --> 02:17:23.805]  When you read Schultz and Eatson's accounts and other accounts of people in true tyranny, and then you see it all manifesting and growing, they've set the precedent for that same level of Soviet tyranny.
[02:17:23.805 --> 02:17:26.506]  Now they're implementing it.
[02:17:26.506 --> 02:17:27.926]  It's got to be hard for you to watch.
[02:17:27.926 --> 02:17:29.187]  I know it's hard for me to watch.
[02:17:29.187 --> 02:17:31.087]  Do you see any way of stopping it?
[02:17:31.087 --> 02:17:33.528]  Can you draw some more parallels of what Schultz and Eatson saw?
[02:17:35.285 --> 02:17:40.186]  Well, you know, I don't think there's any way of stopping it.
[02:17:40.186 --> 02:17:48.568]  It eventually stopped in the Soviet Union because the highest members of the party realized they weren't safe either.
[02:17:48.568 --> 02:18:03.711]  And so when Stalin died, or was put down perhaps, Khrushchev in 1956 gave that secret speech in which he denounced Stalin to the Communist Party, to the Central Committee.
[02:18:05.931 --> 02:18:15.539]  And he did that because no one felt safe, and they had to get rid of that kind of legacy rather than have it continue.
[02:18:15.539 --> 02:18:28.108]  And then, of course, Khrushchev allowed Solzhenitsyn to publish that book one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich, which was the story of the labor camps, the death camps.
[02:18:28.108 --> 02:18:32.752]  And so things started loosening up just in order to protect themselves.
[02:18:33.752 --> 02:18:42.074]  But it took a long time to reach that point, and so I think no American will be safe.
[02:18:42.074 --> 02:18:58.659]  And it won't matter whether you're a critic or not, because anybody could get picked up, or somebody may want your property, or your girlfriend, or your wife, or they may not like you, and so all they've got to do is make a charge.
[02:18:59.264 --> 02:19:03.026]  And by the way, Dr. Roberts, that's not your opinion.
[02:19:03.026 --> 02:19:07.009]  We know how tyrannies work from Rome to today.
[02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:12.212]  Most of the time, the machine just wants to beat people up, rob them, rape them, take their property.
[02:19:12.212 --> 02:19:17.195]  Most of the people that are being abused will have nothing to do with the real boogeymen.
[02:19:17.195 --> 02:19:18.276]  Exactly.
[02:19:18.276 --> 02:19:21.578]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:19:21.578 --> 02:19:27.462]  And it reached the point where the Secret Police and the Service Union, in order to prove their loyalty,
[02:19:28.439 --> 02:19:32.541]  Stay there, let's talk about this more because I have an article where a guy
[02:19:51.892 --> 02:19:55.176]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:19:55.176 --> 02:19:57.339]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:19:57.339 --> 02:19:59.341]  No more mortgage can change your life.
[02:20:07.931 --> 02:20:08.591]  All of our bills.
[02:20:08.591 --> 02:20:10.452]  With no more mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:20:10.452 --> 02:20:11.933]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:20:11.933 --> 02:20:12.973]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:20:12.973 --> 02:20:15.495]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.

[02:24:10.769 --> 02:24:20.957]  Coming up in the next segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, we're going to get into the economy and I'm going to open the phones up specifically for our guests with questions on the economy.
[02:24:20.957 --> 02:24:31.265]  1-800-259-9231 as we close out the year with our regular guests, the great minds that agree to come on this show and share their
[02:24:32.446 --> 02:24:35.128]  Researched knowledge with us 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:35.128 --> 02:24:50.621]  Okay, dr. Roberts Again, I mean we know what real hardcore tyranny is and the Soviets the Nazis They always had great excuses for why they were secretly arresting people and torturing them and now they're gonna put
[02:24:52.557 --> 02:24:57.298]  Different people on trial who've been held four, five, six, seven years in some cases.
[02:24:57.298 --> 02:25:01.540]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, they admittedly threatened his family, admittedly tortured him.
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:03.020]  Now that's admissible.
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:09.002]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till three and a half, four years after he was arrested.
[02:25:09.002 --> 02:25:14.844]  He might as well have confessed to killing Jesus or shooting at the Ford Theater.
[02:25:15.484 --> 02:25:15.804]  Well,
[02:25:45.663 --> 02:25:47.324]  They're evil!
[02:25:47.324 --> 02:26:00.508]  And, uh, as I said, and I think it's clear, there's no difference today in the legal rights of an American citizen and a Soviet citizen under Joseph Stalin.
[02:26:00.508 --> 02:26:03.129]  Neither one has any rights.
[02:26:03.129 --> 02:26:09.811]  All your rights can be turned off simply by the government using a few words.
[02:26:09.811 --> 02:26:12.832]  They can say you're something you're not.
[02:26:12.832 --> 02:26:15.073]  In fact, they don't even really need to do that anymore.
[02:26:16.812 --> 02:26:19.874]  And so, we have no rights, there's no doubt about it.
[02:26:19.874 --> 02:26:27.240]  And to change the subject before we get to the comedy, really quick, did you see that report from the pilots for 9-11 Truth?
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:44.574]  That Flight 77, they got the information from the Air Transportation Safety Administration, or whatever it's called, that the black box that watches the pilot's door every four seconds reports that it was never opened during the whole 90 minutes.
[02:26:45.754 --> 02:26:47.377]  Well, the alleged hijacking.
[02:26:47.377 --> 02:26:51.905]  You know, the official story is that the hijackers forced the pilots out.
[02:26:52.962 --> 02:27:11.737]  And the pilot of that plane was the guy a year before taking part in drills of flying a hijacked jet into the Pentagon.
[02:27:11.737 --> 02:27:15.701]  Then his daughter spoke up and she got firebombed to death in New Jersey.
[02:27:15.701 --> 02:27:20.084]  And then the plane did maneuvers that were physically impossible for the airframe.
[02:27:20.084 --> 02:27:21.385]  Yes, I'm aware of that.
[02:27:21.385 --> 02:27:22.206]  We need to in fact get
[02:27:24.287 --> 02:27:32.590]  You see, no one pays any attention.
[02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:35.752]  It's amazing.
[02:27:35.752 --> 02:27:40.213]  I mean, you would think that Congress would be saying, how could this be?
[02:27:40.213 --> 02:27:42.214]  And we got to have this investigated.
[02:27:42.214 --> 02:27:47.516]  Or somebody, you think, would say, how could this be?
[02:27:47.516 --> 02:27:48.537]  But nothing happened.
[02:27:48.537 --> 02:27:51.018]  So, it's more evidence that
[02:27:51.576 --> 02:27:57.879]  Essentially, the situation in the United States is out of control.
[02:27:57.879 --> 02:27:59.780]  There are no rights.
[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:00.580]  They do what they want.
[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:03.161]  They can say whatever they want, no matter how absurd.
[02:28:03.161 --> 02:28:10.565]  People don't seem to be able to foster any interest to stop it.
[02:28:10.565 --> 02:28:18.289]  And the establishment is geared up wanting a 1776 response, with NORTHCOM wanting to have a war with the people.
[02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:18.929]  But I think
[02:28:20.293 --> 02:28:29.176]  More and more, it's clear that we have to try to get the country back peacefully, but that we can't be drug off to FEMA camps.
[02:28:29.176 --> 02:28:37.898]  I mean, George Washington said, better the entire continent be drenched in blood than we live as slaves.
[02:28:37.898 --> 02:28:42.399]  Well, I agree with that, but I don't know what the American people will do.
[02:28:42.399 --> 02:28:46.441]  They probably won't catch on until it's too late.
[02:28:48.413 --> 02:28:53.356]  The Soviets didn't catch on until nothing could be done.
[02:28:53.356 --> 02:28:56.057]  So, maybe the economy's collapse will save us.
[02:28:56.057 --> 02:28:56.597]  Who knows?
[02:28:56.597 --> 02:29:00.879]  Maybe the dollar's collapse might save us.
[02:29:00.879 --> 02:29:11.865]  If the crowd in Washington loses its economic capability because the dollar goes, then maybe that will be our salvation.
[02:29:14.158 --> 02:29:16.459]  Well, I know I'm evil for quoting George Washington.
[02:29:16.459 --> 02:29:22.481]  I have the FEMA training manuals and footage of the Founding Fathers being demonized to Kansas City Police by FEMA.
[02:29:22.481 --> 02:29:27.163]  And I'm not calling for this, folks, but Washington said, I don't want violence.
[02:29:27.163 --> 02:29:33.505]  But he said, you know, it seems the only thing a virtuous man can do is say that when faced with this,
[02:29:35.302 --> 02:29:37.984]  The only decision you have is to fight.
[02:29:37.984 --> 02:29:39.866]  And we are fighting to warn the people.
[02:29:39.866 --> 02:29:41.367]  We may be able to turn this around.
[02:29:41.367 --> 02:29:43.869]  We had victory over the Copenhagen fraud.
[02:29:43.869 --> 02:29:47.892]  We'll talk about the economy with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the other side.
[02:29:47.892 --> 02:29:49.193]  Very honored to have him.
[02:29:49.193 --> 02:29:51.695]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.695 --> 02:29:53.096]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.096 --> 02:29:55.618]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.618 --> 02:29:58.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.208 --> 02:30:05.871]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:05.871 --> 02:30:09.474]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.474 --> 02:30:14.278]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.278 --> 02:30:20.663]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.663 --> 02:30:22.905]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.405 --> 02:30:23.745]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.745 --> 02:30:24.246]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.246 --> 02:30:24.867]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.867 --> 02:30:25.587]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.587 --> 02:30:27.709]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.344 --> 02:30:44.466]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:44.466 --> 02:30:49.612]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.612 --> 02:30:58.742]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:01.428 --> 02:31:04.449]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.449 --> 02:31:09.770]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:11.811]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.811 --> 02:31:16.813]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.813 --> 02:31:18.013]  How much do you want?
[02:31:18.013 --> 02:31:19.133]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.133 --> 02:31:21.014]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:21.014 --> 02:31:22.094]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.094 --> 02:31:24.295]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.295 --> 02:31:25.635]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.635 --> 02:31:27.156]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.156 --> 02:31:28.196]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:31:28.376 --> 02:31:29.698]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:31:29.698 --> 02:31:32.422]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.422 --> 02:31:36.007]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:36.007 --> 02:31:39.833]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.833 --> 02:31:41.054]  How much will you need?
[02:31:41.054 --> 02:31:41.956]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.956 --> 02:31:43.077]  How much do you want?
[02:31:43.077 --> 02:31:43.999]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.999 --> 02:31:44.820]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:48.121]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:32:04.487 --> 02:32:07.348]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:07.348 --> 02:32:08.628]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:32:08.628 --> 02:32:09.448]  It's very real.
[02:32:09.448 --> 02:32:11.689]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:11.689 --> 02:32:13.330]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:32:50.151 --> 02:32:50.752]  You're looking
[02:33:14.085 --> 02:33:26.750]  And a satisfying fellow Unhappy Well, I should say now If somebody told me that she cheated No, I wouldn't believe them
[02:33:44.687 --> 02:33:45.207]  Okay, folks!
[02:33:45.207 --> 02:33:48.891]  Going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who is with us.
[02:34:14.328 --> 02:34:15.650]  There is so much happening.
[02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:20.697]  I mean, the hedge of liberty and freedom, the hedge of the republic, it created all this wealth.
[02:34:20.697 --> 02:34:28.648]  I mean, Mexico has triple the resources we do, but they're in absolute poverty because their elite uses poverty as a tool of control.
[02:34:28.648 --> 02:34:30.090]  North Korea, the same thing.
[02:34:30.991 --> 02:34:35.734]  And I just grieve for this nation, but we are so decadent.
[02:34:35.734 --> 02:34:48.640]  We know those cycles of people go through adversity, they then stand up against it, they get liberty, then they get plenty and success, and then decadence sets in and rot sets in, and then the takeover happens.
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:50.922]  But I do see people waking up.
[02:34:50.922 --> 02:34:53.683]  I just don't think they've woken up to just how bad it is.
[02:34:53.683 --> 02:34:56.405]  Now, we did have a victory against the cap and trade.
[02:34:57.365 --> 02:35:00.287]  Obama's approval rating is dropping like a rock.
[02:35:00.287 --> 02:35:05.549]  And I mean, do you see anything positive out there turning the corner on this?
[02:35:05.549 --> 02:35:15.574]  Or are you just so shocked by the fact that there's no longer any habeas corpus that you fear for our future?
[02:35:15.574 --> 02:35:24.498]  Yeah, I fear for the future because we have no legal protection and the economy will resume its downward spiral in 2010.
[02:35:27.104 --> 02:35:40.294]  I think we've just started the economic turmoil, and so it's going to get much worse, and people are unprotected.
[02:35:40.294 --> 02:35:42.455]  They've got no savings.
[02:35:42.455 --> 02:35:43.496]  They're losing their homes.
[02:35:43.496 --> 02:35:46.398]  There's no jobs.
[02:35:46.398 --> 02:35:49.160]  There's no health care, and they're not going to get any.
[02:35:52.794 --> 02:36:01.881]  If the dollar itself, at some point the dollar is going to be abandoned as the world reserve currency.
[02:36:01.881 --> 02:36:06.525]  And I don't know when, but at some point this is going to happen.
[02:36:06.525 --> 02:36:11.169]  And when it does, we won't be able to pay for our imports.
[02:36:11.169 --> 02:36:21.697]  And since we're heavily dependent on imports, not just oil and gasoline and energy, but manufactured goods and advanced technology,
[02:36:22.532 --> 02:36:39.218]  It's going to cause amazing disruptions, and particularly in food deliveries to grocery stores, they'll become erratic, and so most likely new rationing systems will go in.
[02:36:39.218 --> 02:36:42.860]  It's a very dismal outlook.
[02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:49.602]  It's receiving no attention because the Washington banks, or at least it's telling the people that we now have a recovery.
[02:36:52.481 --> 02:36:57.603]  It may be a slow recovery, but it's a recovery.
[02:36:57.603 --> 02:37:04.486]  So, it may be what saves us from a police state, or it may bring it on.
[02:37:04.486 --> 02:37:14.270]  You can't tell what the political response to such tremendous economic hardship will be.
[02:37:14.270 --> 02:37:18.972]  Whether it'll be liberating, or whether it'll just bring the
[02:37:36.226 --> 02:37:38.187]  Well, we talk about it day in and day out.
[02:37:38.187 --> 02:37:41.989]  We try to rally the people to wake up and become aware of what's happening.
[02:37:41.989 --> 02:37:46.932]  And I guess the best thing we can do
[02:37:50.236 --> 02:38:16.988]  The best thing we can do, while we're getting Dr. Paul Craig Roberts back, our phone system cut out, the best we can do is just try to warn the people, try to warn the police and military how they're being brainwashed, how they're being incrementally twisted, and hope that, just like in the Soviet Union, after Stalin and Lenin had killed 50 million people, that it stops.
[02:38:16.988 --> 02:38:19.069]  Maybe we can stop it before it gets to that point.
[02:38:20.816 --> 02:38:32.025]  Because FEMA and Homeland Security folks, all they talk about is gun owners and veterans and conservatives and how they want to lock your butts up and how it should be illegal.
[02:38:32.025 --> 02:38:34.106]  Okay, yes, we've got Dr. Roberts back now.
[02:38:34.106 --> 02:38:37.148]  We're going to go ahead and pot him up on air.
[02:38:37.148 --> 02:38:40.751]  Okay, continuing, sir, your phone got cut off there.
[02:38:40.751 --> 02:38:42.452]  Sure it did.
[02:38:42.452 --> 02:38:44.434]  No, no, finishing up your point.
[02:38:44.434 --> 02:38:48.197]  Okay, well, the point is that other currencies are in trouble, too.
[02:38:48.197 --> 02:38:49.578]  For example, the British Pound.
[02:38:51.631 --> 02:38:58.936]  Probably the Euro, because it has so many marginal countries that are part of that, they can't take the pressure.
[02:38:58.936 --> 02:39:03.218]  You know, you've got Greece and Ireland that are having trouble.
[02:39:03.218 --> 02:39:14.125]  So many other currencies are in trouble, that this can sustain the dollar beyond what one might expect.
[02:39:14.125 --> 02:39:19.428]  The British Pound could run into trouble first, and of course then that would strengthen the dollar.
[02:39:20.658 --> 02:39:27.764]  And the euro, as I said, may have trouble because of the weaker countries that are part of that system.
[02:39:27.764 --> 02:39:29.465]  And then that would strengthen the dollar.
[02:39:29.465 --> 02:39:36.751]  So the dollar could look like it was back there being the almighty currency again.
[02:39:36.751 --> 02:39:44.477]  But nothing fundamental would have changed in terms of the dollar's own condition.
[02:39:44.477 --> 02:39:48.580]  It's still being assaulted by the massive
[02:39:49.432 --> 02:39:54.474]  Uh, trade deficits, and by the massive budget deficits.
[02:39:54.474 --> 02:40:06.058]  And as these budget deficits can't be financed, except by creating new money, there is, at some point, the danger of a real hyperinflation.
[02:40:06.058 --> 02:40:11.500]  Now, as I said, you can't put a timeline on any of that.
[02:40:11.500 --> 02:40:17.662]  But, uh, I suspect the worsening economy we will see in this coming year, uh,
[02:40:19.873 --> 02:40:32.381]  And depending on which currency gets in trouble first, if it's the British Pound and the Euro, then the dollar has a longer run to go before it bites the dust as well.
[02:40:32.381 --> 02:40:34.763]  Those things are just unknown.
[02:40:34.763 --> 02:40:43.969]  So this is a derivatives, debt, slave goods from the third world, black hole that is inescapable.
[02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:45.610]  The question is, what
[02:40:47.031 --> 02:40:49.213]  Currencies will be pulled completely in first.
[02:40:49.213 --> 02:41:02.243]  I mean, I remember a couple months ago and then again a month ago on air, you said, I look for the dollar in the next month or two to go back up because other currencies are in trouble and because there's this carry trade no longer going on in Japan and Europe.
[02:41:02.243 --> 02:41:04.025]  It's now coming back into the United States.
[02:41:04.025 --> 02:41:05.986]  Maybe you can explain that to people.
[02:41:05.986 --> 02:41:07.447]  And then when do you see
[02:41:08.368 --> 02:41:11.549]  The dollar beginning to not die, but start going back down.
[02:41:11.549 --> 02:41:15.851]  Because just two months ago they were saying, the dollar's dead, we gotta get its replacement.
[02:41:15.851 --> 02:41:19.452]  Now they're saying, you know, well the dollar's back up for now.
[02:41:19.452 --> 02:41:20.292]  And so what happens?
[02:41:20.292 --> 02:41:23.273]  I mean, we have Main Street imploding.
[02:41:23.273 --> 02:41:25.894]  The worst Christmas since 79.
[02:41:25.894 --> 02:41:28.255]  We have debt exploding.
[02:41:28.255 --> 02:41:33.316]  All these other real numbers coming in showing the real economy is in terminal breakdown.
[02:41:33.316 --> 02:41:34.277]  Meanwhile, the banks
[02:41:35.242 --> 02:41:57.181]  Bloomberg's reporting in the bank re-regulation plan got four trillion extra in goodies that are hidden in there so it just appears that they know the whole world economy is going down and that they just plan to be sitting on top of it with paramilitary national security forces over the rubble in the end.
[02:41:57.181 --> 02:42:00.164]  Yes, could be something like that.
[02:42:00.164 --> 02:42:01.325]  The dollar has strengthened
[02:42:01.698 --> 02:42:05.141]  Because of the belief that we have a recovery.
[02:42:05.141 --> 02:42:09.304]  So foreign money is coming in to the stock market.
[02:42:09.304 --> 02:42:12.046]  And so this supports the dollar.
[02:42:12.046 --> 02:42:17.751]  They change their currency for dollars to buy into the stock.
[02:42:17.751 --> 02:42:24.276]  This is one of the reasons that the dollar has perked up a bit.
[02:42:24.276 --> 02:42:28.360]  And of course, the banking situation remains.
[02:42:29.488 --> 02:42:34.852]  Both here and abroad remains really unknown.
[02:42:34.852 --> 02:42:54.886]  And the fact that the Americans have simply exported such a large percentage of what were middle class jobs, that it means we're going to have high levels of unemployment permanently.
[02:42:54.886 --> 02:42:58.309]  There's no way, there's no jobs for these people to come back to.
[02:43:00.558 --> 02:43:05.361]  So it's the new term in the lexicon, the jobless recovery.
[02:43:05.361 --> 02:43:08.003]  Uh, well, it's not going to be a recovery.
[02:43:08.003 --> 02:43:10.864]  No, I know, but that's like saying a dead man is alive.
[02:43:10.864 --> 02:43:11.965]  Yeah, right.
[02:43:11.965 --> 02:43:13.226]  Alive to commit, yeah.
[02:43:13.226 --> 02:43:14.807]  Yeah, the media is saying that.
[02:43:14.807 --> 02:43:15.567]  Right.
[02:43:15.567 --> 02:43:21.090]  Well, yeah, it's a nonsensical term, uh, to have a jobless recovery.
[02:43:21.090 --> 02:43:26.854]  Now, the government also can fake the statistics within a certain range.
[02:43:26.854 --> 02:43:28.475]  They can't, they can't
[02:43:29.036 --> 02:43:33.980]  I mean, they do it tremendously, but within a certain range they can break the statistics.
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:41.087]  And one of the ways they produce real economic growth is by understating inflation.
[02:43:41.087 --> 02:43:52.757]  So, you know, if they can make the inflation seem like it's not really inflation, then what is inflation can be called economic growth.
[02:43:52.757 --> 02:43:53.878]  So they can do that.
[02:43:55.034 --> 02:44:03.939]  And if unemployment's really at 21%, if they say it's 10, that can cook the numbers, where really the economy is still declining, they're just cooking the numbers.
[02:44:03.939 --> 02:44:04.480]  That's right.
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:13.805]  They've changed the way they count the unemployed, and so that about half of them no longer count it.
[02:44:13.805 --> 02:44:16.747]  But actually, they do have a second measure they use.
[02:44:16.747 --> 02:44:18.048]  It's just never reported.
[02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:22.770]  And that second measure does count a lot of the
[02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:26.570]  Discouraged workers.
[02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:36.194]  And I think, according to that second measure from the BLS, it measures 16 or 17% unemployment.
[02:44:36.194 --> 02:44:47.858]  And so, even the government will admit that the 10% is just sort of a headline number they report, but that their own real number is 16 or 17%.
[02:44:47.858 --> 02:44:51.600]  But if you go ahead and adjust all the figures back to how they used to count it, it is 21%.
[02:44:54.312 --> 02:44:58.497]  And these jobs are gone.
[02:44:58.497 --> 02:45:05.484]  If you look at Detroit or Michigan, I mean, it just looks like a bombed out area.
[02:45:05.484 --> 02:45:07.326]  The industry's gone.
[02:45:07.326 --> 02:45:08.648]  The tax base is gone.
[02:45:09.994 --> 02:45:19.780]  Well, look at Detroit, and many areas of Michigan have right at 50% unemployment, and the government just keeps raising taxes, more police, more checkpoints, more fines.
[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:21.281]  I live in Texas.
[02:45:21.281 --> 02:45:25.004]  In the last two years, they've announced five new business taxes.
[02:45:25.004 --> 02:45:29.787]  Every few months, some new bureaucrat shows up and says, you didn't know about this new tax, buddy?
[02:45:29.787 --> 02:45:32.229]  And they're arrogant, and they're bossy.
[02:45:32.229 --> 02:45:38.353]  And I mean, and I'm getting to the point of like, I want to keep getting the word out, but if I was just a regular business person,
[02:45:39.853 --> 02:45:42.474]  You know, why would I want to employ a bunch of people?
[02:45:42.474 --> 02:45:48.035]  Why would I want to take a bunch of risk so some parasite can come to my door and boss me around?
[02:45:48.035 --> 02:45:49.816]  Right.
[02:45:49.816 --> 02:45:54.597]  Like you said earlier, Alex, we're slaves.
[02:45:54.597 --> 02:45:55.197]  We're slaves.
[02:45:55.197 --> 02:45:57.798]  We don't own our own labor.
[02:45:57.798 --> 02:46:01.679]  We have no legal protection.
[02:46:01.679 --> 02:46:08.361]  We can't, you know, you can't get the truth from what used to be reliable
[02:46:09.147 --> 02:46:14.009]  Television and print media.
[02:46:14.009 --> 02:46:22.313]  It's just not a situation that bodes any promise for anything good.
[02:46:22.313 --> 02:46:26.174]  There's no way you can come out of this.
[02:46:26.174 --> 02:46:29.476]  You're fed disinformation.
[02:46:29.476 --> 02:46:32.137]  Your rights are taken away.
[02:46:32.137 --> 02:46:34.638]  Your jobs are taken away.
[02:46:37.188 --> 02:46:44.417]  And then they say they're going to give you health care by making you buy a private insurance policy.
[02:46:44.417 --> 02:46:46.600]  And that's the whole problem then.
[02:46:47.216 --> 02:47:00.620]  And then even the socialists, even Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich and all these big liberals, they read the bill and said, my God, this is a rip-off to banks and insurance companies and liability protection for big pharma.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:09.683]  They raise the taxes, threaten to throw you in jail, make you buy insurance, penalize people that got fancy plans with a 40% tax.
[02:47:11.363 --> 02:47:15.906]  There's at least 19 new taxes in the bill, AP has reported.
[02:47:15.906 --> 02:47:21.009]  The Democrats don't want it, the conservatives don't want it, but the establishment wants it.
[02:47:21.009 --> 02:47:25.212]  I mean, this is a rogue government.
[02:47:25.212 --> 02:47:28.494]  It's a government of special interests.
[02:47:28.494 --> 02:47:34.798]  There are a few well-organized powerful special interests, and they control the government.
[02:47:35.598 --> 02:47:36.558]  And we know who they are.
[02:47:36.558 --> 02:47:37.759]  We know it's AIPAC.
[02:47:37.759 --> 02:47:39.940]  It's the financial lobby.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:41.620]  It's the military security lobby.
[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:45.922]  It's the private insurance lobby.
[02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:49.023]  And it's the tort lawyers.
[02:47:49.023 --> 02:47:52.324]  And they control the government.
[02:47:52.324 --> 02:48:00.667]  And the government does what they say because they provide the campaign contributions that get the members elected.
[02:48:00.667 --> 02:48:04.849]  And that's why it's hard for people to take the government back because
[02:48:06.141 --> 02:48:12.343]  The government is dependent on a handful of organized special interests for the campaign contributions.
[02:48:12.343 --> 02:48:18.744]  So we went wrong when we allowed that type of campaign finance.
[02:48:18.744 --> 02:48:25.166]  And it was done under the guise of the First Amendment right.
[02:48:25.166 --> 02:48:28.587]  But, of course, it destroyed all the rights.
[02:48:28.587 --> 02:48:34.268]  And I don't see how you can change it, because now these members are
[02:48:35.804 --> 02:48:44.994]  And it's deeper than that, though.
[02:48:44.994 --> 02:48:51.120]  There's also a lot of blackmail going on, and it's come out the MI6 spies on the Parliament and blackmails them.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:55.365]  I mean, this is just... this is just a black hole of corruption.
[02:48:55.984 --> 02:49:02.469]  Well, that's the reason, in my view, that Bush was violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:06.693]  He was spying on people without warrants because it had nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:49:06.693 --> 02:49:10.396]  He was getting the goods on the Democrats so they couldn't oppose his program.
[02:49:10.396 --> 02:49:16.321]  Yeah, you said that here about three years ago, and what that came out earlier this year, that congressmen were spied on.
[02:49:16.321 --> 02:49:17.322]  Yeah.
[02:49:17.322 --> 02:49:23.447]  Well, I said it when we first learned that he was violating the Foreign Intelligence
[02:49:23.903 --> 02:49:29.367]  There's no reason to violate it, because it doesn't prevent you from spying.
[02:49:29.367 --> 02:49:32.230]  It just makes you go to a court to get a warrant.
[02:49:32.230 --> 02:49:36.233]  But if you're trying, it means you have to have a real reason.
[02:49:36.233 --> 02:49:42.458]  So you can't go to the court and say, well, I want to spy on the Democrats so I can blackmail them.
[02:49:42.458 --> 02:49:45.801]  And so that's why they were spying without a warrant.
[02:49:45.801 --> 02:49:46.982]  And they got away with it.
[02:49:46.982 --> 02:49:49.664]  And it's a felony.
[02:49:49.664 --> 02:49:50.464]  And nothing happened.
[02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:57.172]  So how does this emboldening end, where they set the precedent?
[02:49:57.172 --> 02:50:03.056]  We spy illegally, we arrest illegally, we torture, we put the tortured on trial.
[02:50:03.056 --> 02:50:05.557]  I mean, what comes next?
[02:50:05.557 --> 02:50:07.559]  It just gets worse and worse.
[02:50:07.559 --> 02:50:09.660]  It's a Stalinist state.
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:12.482]  And it's all due to 9-11.
[02:50:12.482 --> 02:50:18.486]  Which many people, as you know, yourself included, think was an inside job.
[02:50:18.486 --> 02:50:21.788]  So they used something to destroy
[02:50:22.825 --> 02:50:26.706]  Our rights and our prospects.
[02:50:26.706 --> 02:50:30.087]  So they could be secure in robbing everything?
[02:50:30.087 --> 02:50:32.307]  I think so.
[02:50:32.307 --> 02:50:32.927]  You know what?
[02:50:32.927 --> 02:50:34.408]  It's evil isn't it?
[02:50:34.408 --> 02:50:39.609]  I mean, evil is not always explicable.
[02:50:39.609 --> 02:50:41.609]  Why?
[02:50:41.609 --> 02:50:43.350]  Why do this?
[02:50:43.350 --> 02:50:44.750]  Power.
[02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:45.570]  Power.
[02:50:45.570 --> 02:50:46.690]  Power.
[02:50:46.690 --> 02:50:48.931]  Power is the horse ridden by evil.
[02:50:52.131 --> 02:50:54.293]  Stay there, Dr. Roberts.

[02:50:56.995 --> 02:50:59.217]  Come right back for Dr. Roberts' final segment.

[02:51:30.996 --> 02:51:31.356]  I think so.
[02:52:02.660 --> 02:52:06.681]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.681 --> 02:52:09.922]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.922 --> 02:52:14.744]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.744 --> 02:52:18.585]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[02:52:19.225 --> 02:52:21.106]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.106 --> 02:52:26.309]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:29.571]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:29.571 --> 02:52:36.415]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.415 --> 02:52:38.777]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.777 --> 02:52:40.358]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.358 --> 02:52:42.579]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.799 --> 02:52:47.185]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:52:47.185 --> 02:52:50.089]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:15.609 --> 02:54:35.174]  George Jones, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts with us.
[02:54:35.174 --> 02:54:37.495]  He got cut off by that satellite break.
[02:54:37.495 --> 02:54:42.856]  Dr. Roberts, finishing your point in the five minutes we've got left going into the new year.
[02:54:42.856 --> 02:54:44.617]  Any other issues that you think are important?
[02:54:45.796 --> 02:54:58.200]  Well, Alex, you were talking about blackmail, and I would like to ask you, did you see that Wayne Madsen report that the CIA had been involved in child sex trade since 1978?
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:54:59.720]  Yes.
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:12.204]  And that when these government, American government big shots and congressmen would travel to Bangkok, the CIA would provide them with children for sexual purposes.
[02:55:13.146 --> 02:55:19.087]  And then they had complete blackmail power over them.
[02:55:19.087 --> 02:55:33.851]  Just looking at that report, which I read in the Rock Creek Press, apparently an alternative newspaper that's just really amazing in the things that it covers, I was thinking, how could the congressman be that dumb?
[02:55:33.851 --> 02:55:39.992]  I mean, how could people be this stupid to
[02:55:41.350 --> 02:55:45.033]  They don't realize they're setting themselves up for blackmail?
[02:55:45.033 --> 02:55:51.697]  I mean... From what I've been told by talking to some... You've been in higher levels of the system than I have, sir.
[02:55:51.697 --> 02:55:52.638]  I haven't been in government.
[02:55:52.638 --> 02:55:55.279]  You've been the head of policy at the Treasury.
[02:55:55.279 --> 02:56:01.103]  But at the higher levels of this corruption, you don't get into the guild without wallowing in the muck.
[02:56:01.103 --> 02:56:02.664]  It is an initiation.
[02:56:02.664 --> 02:56:09.589]  And so they knowingly go to these events, and they knowingly know they're being set up to prove themselves.
[02:56:11.209 --> 02:56:12.050]  I think.
[02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:15.015]  Like, joining one of those L.A.
[02:56:15.015 --> 02:56:17.098]  gangs, you have to kill somebody first or something.
[02:56:28.752 --> 02:56:29.613]  It's funny you said L.A.
[02:56:29.613 --> 02:56:31.114]  because you said it's just like these L.A.
[02:56:31.114 --> 02:56:31.814]  gangs.
[02:56:31.814 --> 02:56:37.758]  That's what the really powerful corrupt politicians do at state, county, city, and federal.
[02:56:37.758 --> 02:56:42.381]  And then they all work in international crime guilds where it's not all organized.
[02:56:42.381 --> 02:56:44.343]  It's just, oh, you can trust this person.
[02:56:44.343 --> 02:56:46.004]  He's dirty.
[02:56:46.004 --> 02:56:47.084]  Uh-huh.
[02:56:47.084 --> 02:56:47.605]  Yeah.
[02:56:47.605 --> 02:56:49.146]  That's it.
[02:56:49.146 --> 02:56:55.490]  And that's, of course, what's happening to our own police.
[02:56:55.490 --> 02:56:56.491]  Even local police.
[02:56:58.246 --> 02:57:03.787]  Once the corrupt element comes in, you either have to join up with it or they drive you out.
[02:57:03.787 --> 02:57:12.669]  I've had a lot of police officers, former police officers, write to me and email me and tell me that.
[02:57:12.669 --> 02:57:21.951]  So, it looks like we now have a system in which there's no ethics in it at any place, at any point.
[02:57:25.543 --> 02:57:30.747]  So something that rotten would seem to be beyond redemption.
[02:57:30.747 --> 02:57:31.788]  I agree with you.
[02:57:31.788 --> 02:57:33.149]  We are beyond redemption.
[02:57:33.149 --> 02:57:35.790]  50-something million abortions, you name it.
[02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:39.193]  But the question is, what are we going to build on the ashes of this?
[02:57:39.193 --> 02:57:40.994]  Something worse or something better?
[02:57:40.994 --> 02:57:49.921]  And thanks to you with your columns, and thanks to the books you've written and all the other great people out there fighting, we're, as Ron Paul said, putting out the alternative
[02:57:50.964 --> 02:57:51.665]  Well, I hope you're right.
[02:57:51.665 --> 02:57:55.928]  I certainly hope you're right, Alex, and you're certainly more than anybody doing your part.
[02:58:07.895 --> 02:58:11.198]  Well, a lot of smart money said what you said earlier.
[02:58:11.198 --> 02:58:15.101]  The collapse is probably the best thing we can hope for, that they're just so corrupt.
[02:58:15.101 --> 02:58:18.184]  They're not as focused as the Soviets or as the Nazis.
[02:58:18.184 --> 02:58:25.551]  They're as evil, but they're so decadent that it's just going to fall of its own entropy and corruption.
[02:58:25.551 --> 02:58:26.491]  Have a great New Year.
[02:58:26.491 --> 02:58:32.417]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, author of The Tyranny of Good Intentions, on store shelves everywhere.
[02:58:32.417 --> 02:58:34.739]  God bless you and say hi to the family for me.
[02:58:34.739 --> 02:58:35.039]  Thank you.
[02:58:36.442 --> 02:58:42.905]  We'll be right back to talk about George Washington, the big terrorist.
[02:58:42.905 --> 02:58:46.427]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.427 --> 02:58:50.969]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.969 --> 02:58:56.271]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:58:56.271 --> 02:59:00.814]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:59:00.814 --> 02:59:03.095]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:59:03.095 --> 02:59:04.715]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:59:04.715 --> 02:59:05.756]  There is a solution.
[02:59:05.976 --> 02:59:14.404]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:59:54.173 --> 02:59:56.556]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.556 --> 02:59:59.359]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:24.293 --> 03:00:26.677]  Unhappy it is, though, to reflect.
[03:00:27.659 --> 03:00:32.581]  That a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast.
[03:00:32.581 --> 03:00:42.725]  And that the once happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves.
[03:00:42.725 --> 03:00:49.547]  Sad alternative, but can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?
[03:00:49.547 --> 03:00:53.809]  George Washington, after the battles of Lexington and Concord.
[03:00:54.827 --> 03:01:04.553]  Washington made this statement that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to our own government.
[03:01:04.553 --> 03:01:06.455]  He said that in 1776.
[03:01:06.455 --> 03:01:15.741]  Both those two different quotes from letters.
[03:01:15.741 --> 03:01:19.003]  Our founding fathers knew who the enemy was.
[03:01:19.003 --> 03:01:21.765]  It was the corrupt, out-of-control bureaucracy
[03:01:25.404 --> 03:01:31.166]  Filching and stealing and robbing and griming and controlling.
[03:01:31.166 --> 03:01:46.731]  We have to first identify the illegitimate bankers and have grand juries indict them and have the people expose them and get a spirit of victory and liberty about us to go out now that the people are ready to hear the truth and to expose the enemies of the Republic.
[03:01:48.331 --> 03:01:53.955]  If the public is given true leadership and a real choice, we can fix this in a non-violent fashion.
[03:01:53.955 --> 03:01:59.558]  The globalists will stage some terror attacks and try to bustle around with troops and pose as our saviors.
[03:01:59.558 --> 03:02:02.020]  They're trying to ninny us right now.
[03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:05.062]  They're trying to castrate us right now.
[03:02:05.062 --> 03:02:07.043]  I don't want a violent confrontation.
[03:02:07.043 --> 03:02:14.207]  We haven't reached the point that George Washington had reached in Lexington and Concord in 1775 and then in 1776 with his shorter statement
[03:02:18.595 --> 03:02:26.001]  Of that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to our own government.
[03:02:26.001 --> 03:02:30.565]  We have not reached that point in our fight against these tyrants yet.
[03:02:33.749 --> 03:02:46.934]  We need to continue with the committees of correspondence to expose these individuals and to go out to the police and military and state the facts of the case and to show people the sides so they may choose.
[03:02:46.934 --> 03:02:49.995]  Choose your destiny wisely.
[03:02:49.995 --> 03:02:57.578]  You do not know that every man and woman is the captain of their destiny, the captain of the choices they make on the road to that destiny.
[03:02:59.107 --> 03:03:12.298]  You have been taught to be so passive, to just accept the world as it is and not realize you are the great captains of your fortune, of your destiny.
[03:03:12.298 --> 03:03:18.263]  I'm going to be covering George Washington coming up at the bottom of this hour.
[03:03:18.263 --> 03:03:23.568]  I want to cover some other news I haven't gotten to, some world news, some terror news, and a review of
[03:03:25.712 --> 03:03:35.237]  To 2009, which they're calling the new decade of the first millennium of the third millennium of the new century.
[03:03:35.237 --> 03:03:39.419]  It is the ninth year of the new millennium.
[03:03:39.419 --> 03:03:40.359]  The new millennium began in 2001.
[03:03:42.756 --> 03:03:44.597]  But again, everything's a lie.
[03:03:44.597 --> 03:03:45.837]  Everything's a fraud.
[03:03:45.837 --> 03:03:48.678]  Everything is deliberately defiled.
[03:03:48.678 --> 03:03:56.281]  Every form of reality and fact is deliberately turned on its head so that everything is a confusing jumble.
[03:03:56.281 --> 03:04:04.684]  It's like going into a studio that has hundreds of wires all tied together and you can't figure it out so you just throw your hands up and walk away.
[03:04:04.684 --> 03:04:08.405]  There is a method to the madness and the globalists have bragged about it.
[03:04:08.405 --> 03:04:11.766]  So we're going to be covering that coming up.
[03:04:16.038 --> 03:04:20.201]  My son is in there, hovering over the equipment.
[03:04:20.201 --> 03:04:22.322]  Hey, don't touch that stuff.
[03:04:22.322 --> 03:04:24.163]  None of my employees want to tell him no.
[03:04:24.163 --> 03:04:26.165]  You guys put him in his place when he's getting out of control.
[03:04:26.165 --> 03:04:28.306]  He's not being bad, he just sees all those controls.
[03:04:28.306 --> 03:04:31.989]  He wants to get in here and get on the radio.
[03:04:31.989 --> 03:04:36.372]  Gotta hear him and my daughter go big brother mainstream media.
[03:04:36.372 --> 03:04:37.212]  You want answers?
[03:04:37.212 --> 03:04:37.913]  Well, so does he.
[03:04:39.701 --> 03:04:43.766]  Okay, children are so darling, so innocent, so good, so full of life.
[03:04:43.766 --> 03:04:47.850]  The world, Madison Avenue, hasn't taught them to feel inadequate yet.
[03:04:47.850 --> 03:04:51.935]  Hasn't taken the mystery and wonder out of their souls.
[03:04:51.935 --> 03:05:00.425]  In the eyes of a child, in the heart of a child, is the future of our planet and our destiny as a species, and is the seed of God.
[03:05:00.936 --> 03:05:05.478]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:05.478 --> 03:05:06.398]  Number one.
[03:05:06.398 --> 03:05:09.820]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:09.820 --> 03:05:10.680]  Number two.
[03:05:10.680 --> 03:05:15.562]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.562 --> 03:05:16.302]  It's true.
[03:05:16.302 --> 03:05:20.864]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.184 --> 03:05:22.005]  Number 3.
[03:05:22.005 --> 03:05:25.588]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.588 --> 03:05:29.511]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:29.511 --> 03:05:30.311]  Number 4.
[03:05:30.311 --> 03:05:33.073]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:33.073 --> 03:05:36.756]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:36.756 --> 03:05:37.537]  Number 5.
[03:05:37.537 --> 03:05:41.680]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:46.444]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:06:01.397 --> 03:06:04.398]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.398 --> 03:06:09.739]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.739 --> 03:06:11.780]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.780 --> 03:06:16.782]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.782 --> 03:06:17.962]  How much do you want?
[03:06:17.962 --> 03:06:19.082]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.082 --> 03:06:20.963]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:20.963 --> 03:06:22.043]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.043 --> 03:06:24.244]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.244 --> 03:06:25.584]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.584 --> 03:06:27.105]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.105 --> 03:06:28.165]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:06:28.325 --> 03:06:29.647]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:06:29.647 --> 03:06:32.370]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.370 --> 03:06:35.955]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:35.955 --> 03:06:39.780]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.780 --> 03:06:41.021]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.021 --> 03:06:41.922]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.922 --> 03:06:43.024]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.024 --> 03:06:43.965]  All you can get.
[03:06:43.965 --> 03:06:44.766]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.026 --> 03:06:48.088]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.088 --> 03:06:49.850]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:49.850 --> 03:06:50.770]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.362 --> 03:07:05.669]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:07:05.669 --> 03:07:10.195]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:07:10.195 --> 03:07:12.478]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:07:12.478 --> 03:07:14.100]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:15.142]  There is a solution.
[03:07:15.362 --> 03:07:23.790]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:07:23.790 --> 03:07:31.237]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:07:31.237 --> 03:07:36.922]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:07:37.262 --> 03:07:43.286]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:07:43.286 --> 03:07:47.449]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:07:47.449 --> 03:07:54.914]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[03:07:54.914 --> 03:07:58.236]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[03:08:02.466 --> 03:08:05.251]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.251 --> 03:08:08.075]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:29.828 --> 03:08:33.769]  All over the United States, the people are ninnying in fear.
[03:08:33.769 --> 03:08:35.310]  A van's parked in front of a building.
[03:08:35.310 --> 03:08:36.230]  Everyone panics.
[03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:41.912]  The police look like they've seen a 900-foot goblin.
[03:08:41.912 --> 03:08:44.053]  It's just a nation.
[03:08:44.053 --> 03:08:46.174]  There's a backfire in D.C.
[03:08:46.174 --> 03:08:47.394]  They lock down the Capitol.
[03:08:47.394 --> 03:08:49.435]  Men with guns come in and order congressmen out.
[03:08:51.991 --> 03:09:00.360]  The security system is doing the same thing 3,000 years ago that the Chinese ruling dynasty had done to them by their security staff.
[03:09:01.861 --> 03:09:05.384]  Oh, you've got to be behind this walled area of the city where you're safe.
[03:09:05.384 --> 03:09:06.926]  You can't ever go out.
[03:09:06.926 --> 03:09:11.630]  Oh, you've got to have your feet bound because you're so pretty, you're not allowed to walk.
[03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:12.631]  You've got to be carried.
[03:09:12.631 --> 03:09:17.235]  Oh, you can't cut your fingernails because that would mean you were feeding yourself.
[03:09:17.235 --> 03:09:22.099]  And then the true ruling elite developed as the bureaucracy.
[03:09:22.099 --> 03:09:25.662]  Most power is behind the throne.
[03:09:25.662 --> 03:09:27.604]  And now the police say, hey,
[03:09:29.201 --> 03:09:31.063]  A Volkswagen backfired!
[03:09:31.063 --> 03:09:32.684]  Get on the ground, Congressman!
[03:09:32.684 --> 03:09:38.329]  You know, there's videos of congressmen not running fast enough and SWAT teams are like, get out of here!
[03:09:38.329 --> 03:09:40.231]  I'm running everything now!
[03:09:40.231 --> 03:09:41.753]  I work for the Federal Reserve!
[03:09:41.753 --> 03:09:43.314]  Of course, they don't even know that.
[03:09:43.314 --> 03:09:51.401]  All over the country, my cameraman will be in Kansas City, half a mile away from the Federal Reserve at a city park, filming it from a distance, and guys show up,
[03:09:52.122 --> 03:09:56.404]  Private security guards off their jurisdiction with guns, hands on guns.
[03:09:56.404 --> 03:09:57.785]  You've seen the video on YouTube.
[03:09:57.785 --> 03:10:00.206]  Kansas City Star said it was pretty good.
[03:10:00.206 --> 03:10:01.526]  They said, yeah.
[03:10:01.526 --> 03:10:05.628]  Kansas City Star reporter called me up and said, what's wrong with that?
[03:10:05.628 --> 03:10:08.750]  What were they doing at the park?
[03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:10.170]  And then they called the Federal Reserve.
[03:10:10.170 --> 03:10:13.772]  Federal Reserve said, we never even did that.
[03:10:13.772 --> 03:10:15.413]  We know nothing about it.
[03:10:15.413 --> 03:10:17.113]  All over the country they do the same thing.
[03:10:17.113 --> 03:10:20.295]  You've got video of it and the news just says it doesn't exist.
[03:10:22.441 --> 03:10:24.703]  It's basically what ended up happening.
[03:10:24.703 --> 03:10:44.302]  I see articles every week about the film New World Order, made for IFC, where it shows us at Bilderberg, shows the black limousine, shows the Secret Service talking into their wrist, the dark sunglasses, and I saw what the Olympian newspaper out of Washington State last week,
[03:10:45.899 --> 03:10:48.921]  Just said, I'm completely delusional.
[03:10:48.921 --> 03:10:53.385]  I was imagining cars following me, imagining this meeting.
[03:10:53.385 --> 03:10:56.567]  Psychology Today said that.
[03:10:56.567 --> 03:10:58.929]  It doesn't matter if it's all admitted.
[03:10:58.929 --> 03:11:03.453]  Doesn't matter if Rick Perry's in the Dallas Morning News admitting he goes.
[03:11:03.453 --> 03:11:05.454]  They just say, doesn't exist.
[03:11:05.454 --> 03:11:06.835]  And it's their little funny game.
[03:11:06.835 --> 03:11:10.058]  They know full well it exists, like Winston Smith in 1984.
[03:11:10.058 --> 03:11:10.618]  They think it's cute.
[03:11:15.711 --> 03:11:21.573]  They think it's funny.
[03:11:21.573 --> 03:11:28.495]  I mean, what do these yuppies think is funny?
[03:11:28.495 --> 03:11:32.276]  They think it's funny playing mind games with people.
[03:11:32.276 --> 03:11:36.357]  Going, there's no world government, Alex, you're ill.
[03:11:36.357 --> 03:11:41.239]  But I have hundreds of articles this week calling for world government, the banks, we're going to pay our taxes to them.
[03:11:41.239 --> 03:11:43.740]  And you went to the doctor for that?
[03:11:44.588 --> 03:11:46.569]  Hey, look at the drug insert for this vaccine.
[03:11:46.569 --> 03:11:50.772]  It says causes cancer, sterilizes you, has mercury in it.
[03:11:50.772 --> 03:11:53.473]  It doesn't have mercury, Alex.
[03:11:53.473 --> 03:11:55.214]  Why do you feel you need to make that up?
[03:11:55.214 --> 03:11:56.535]  No, I have the drug insert.
[03:11:56.535 --> 03:11:57.856]  You can get one at Walgreens.
[03:11:57.856 --> 03:12:02.498]  I'm... Alex, you're ill?
[03:12:02.498 --> 03:12:03.979]  They know full well.
[03:12:03.979 --> 03:12:05.420]  They're into the power.
[03:12:05.420 --> 03:12:07.001]  They're into the mind game.
[03:12:07.001 --> 03:12:10.423]  They like writing articles lying to their readers.
[03:12:10.423 --> 03:12:12.344]  They get off on it.
[03:12:12.344 --> 03:12:13.425]  It's a power trip.
[03:12:14.364 --> 03:12:16.205]  I get off on telling the truth.
[03:12:16.205 --> 03:12:20.488]  I get off on a bully starting a fight with me and breaking their nose.
[03:12:20.488 --> 03:12:23.669]  I get off on helping old ladies across the street.
[03:12:23.669 --> 03:12:25.090]  I get off on telling the truth.
[03:12:25.090 --> 03:12:29.533]  I get off on having courage.
[03:12:29.533 --> 03:12:32.614]  I enjoy being virtuous.
[03:12:32.614 --> 03:12:37.437]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, but I enjoy wanting to be good.
[03:12:37.437 --> 03:12:39.518]  And these people see that as weak.
[03:12:39.518 --> 03:12:40.499]  They think it's funny.
[03:12:44.585 --> 03:12:46.846]  And they wreck society!
[03:12:46.846 --> 03:12:57.630]  And they always squeal like bloody murder when the system they've conjured up, the tyranny they've risen through their evil actions out of the pit of hell that they've conjured.
[03:12:57.630 --> 03:13:02.672]  When it's tearing them apart, they squeal like little pigs!
[03:13:02.672 --> 03:13:06.054]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and get into the other news and then George Washington.
[03:13:06.054 --> 03:13:09.815]  Let's do this now.
[03:13:09.815 --> 03:13:10.596]  Trying to find it.
[03:13:10.596 --> 03:13:11.396]  I've got my, um...
[03:13:14.890 --> 03:13:16.311]  There's just too much.
[03:13:16.311 --> 03:13:23.177]  I've got my printout about Ecosnoop.com.
[03:13:23.177 --> 03:13:30.143]  And if you guys can, get me the Ecosnoop website up on screen.
[03:13:30.143 --> 03:13:32.025]  Craig had that.
[03:13:32.025 --> 03:13:36.509]  This morning I came in early and we got it up on screen and everything.
[03:13:36.509 --> 03:13:40.812]  I guess he's not here.
[03:13:40.812 --> 03:13:40.992]  But...
[03:13:45.655 --> 03:13:46.936]  EcoSnoop.com.
[03:13:46.936 --> 03:13:51.579]  This is a new iPhone application.
[03:13:51.579 --> 03:13:56.582]  You know, we don't have George Soros funding us with InfoWars.com applications.
[03:13:56.582 --> 03:13:59.424]  The few people that have approached us just wanted to do some business deal with us.
[03:13:59.424 --> 03:14:00.925]  I don't have time to do that.
[03:14:00.925 --> 03:14:05.589]  Somebody wants to give us an application to just stream my radio show and my website.
[03:14:05.589 --> 03:14:06.649]  We would love to do it.
[03:14:06.649 --> 03:14:09.731]  Give it to us, we'll launch it.
[03:14:09.731 --> 03:14:11.352]  There's millions of these applications.
[03:14:11.352 --> 03:14:11.953]  We need one.
[03:14:14.238 --> 03:14:23.173]  Instead, EcoSnoop is an application where you go around spying and tattling on your neighbors.
[03:14:27.299 --> 03:14:40.627]  And, oh, if an office building has the lights on, it doesn't mean someone's working in there at night in an insurance office or in a bank or in a non-profit or in a sprockets manufacturer.
[03:14:40.627 --> 03:14:47.452]  It doesn't mean that there's people who actually work at night in America and all over the world.
[03:14:47.452 --> 03:14:49.833]  You ever been in an office at night?
[03:14:49.833 --> 03:14:52.755]  The winners are there, okay?
[03:14:52.755 --> 03:14:55.056]  But the issue here is that
[03:14:58.462 --> 03:14:59.943]  They call it an offense.
[03:14:59.943 --> 03:15:01.505]  They call it a crime.
[03:15:01.505 --> 03:15:05.108]  And they have eco-cop training for kids in England, the U.S., Australia.
[03:15:05.108 --> 03:15:06.489]  They have a TV show in the U.S.
[03:15:06.489 --> 03:15:09.952]  called Eco-Cops.
[03:15:09.952 --> 03:15:16.938]  And it's all packaged in the idea of, well, we're not Big Brother.
[03:15:16.938 --> 03:15:18.179]  We're just helping.
[03:15:18.179 --> 03:15:20.581]  And we're gonna save you money on your energy.
[03:15:20.581 --> 03:15:22.622]  But then you see what people are tattling on.
[03:15:22.622 --> 03:15:25.405]  It uploads the iPhone to their site, EcoSnoop.
[03:15:27.233 --> 03:15:33.539]  And it says stuff in there like, garden too long, garden not watered.
[03:15:33.539 --> 03:15:36.622]  Or, oh, look at this gas station, they have the lights on.
[03:15:36.622 --> 03:15:46.351]  Yeah, it's a foggy, rainy day, and there's lights on at the gas station, as if light and power is evil.
[03:15:46.351 --> 03:15:48.793]  I want to play a video review
[03:15:50.297 --> 03:15:52.559]  Of eco-snoops for you.
[03:15:52.559 --> 03:15:58.724]  And again, this is only one of, no exaggeration, 20, 30, I don't know, things I see a week like this.
[03:15:58.724 --> 03:16:07.432]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall, and while you're at work paying taxes, your kids are in the school you paid for, being taught that you're bad and to be spied on.
[03:16:08.345 --> 03:16:19.489]  And they set the precedent with this to get people spying and tattling and filling out dossiers on their parents, on their schools, on corporations, and then they're already shifting it.
[03:16:19.489 --> 03:16:22.850]  It's like they have FBI meetings to fight al-Qaeda in even rural areas.
[03:16:22.850 --> 03:16:25.191]  You go to the meeting, it's a two-day meeting, they got free coffee doughnuts.
[03:16:26.380 --> 03:16:28.621]  Ten minutes is Al-Qaeda training videos.
[03:16:28.621 --> 03:16:32.302]  I've seen video that Austinite shot of this and I've read about it in the news over and over again.
[03:16:32.302 --> 03:16:33.483]  It's always the same.
[03:16:33.483 --> 03:16:34.603]  They show Al-Qaeda training.
[03:16:34.603 --> 03:16:35.903]  Al-Qaeda's gonna get you.
[03:16:35.903 --> 03:16:38.344]  Now, we want you to tattle on your neighbors.
[03:16:38.344 --> 03:16:39.405]  Are they spanking their kids?
[03:16:39.405 --> 03:16:40.545]  Are they growing marijuana?
[03:16:40.545 --> 03:16:42.726]  This is what marijuana looks like.
[03:16:42.726 --> 03:16:46.367]  Has nothing to do with the stupid terrorists, even if you believe they exist.
[03:16:46.367 --> 03:16:48.568]  Have you read the MIAC report on Homeland Security?
[03:16:48.568 --> 03:16:50.429]  It's for you!
[03:16:50.429 --> 03:16:54.010]  And police have been caught nationwide planting drugs on people to steal their land.
[03:16:54.858 --> 03:16:56.059]  They'll kill you!
[03:16:56.059 --> 03:16:56.660]  Famous L.A.
[03:16:56.660 --> 03:16:57.901]  County case.
[03:16:57.901 --> 03:16:59.023]  They want your property.
[03:16:59.023 --> 03:17:00.184]  They're criminals!
[03:17:00.184 --> 03:17:01.665]  They're taking over!
[03:17:01.665 --> 03:17:05.890]  Not all police, but basically soon it will be all.
[03:17:05.890 --> 03:17:09.133]  The highest group of criminals you're going to find is government and their enforcers.
[03:17:09.133 --> 03:17:09.454]  Period.
[03:17:09.454 --> 03:17:10.375]  That's history.
[03:17:10.375 --> 03:17:11.596]  And now it's come here.
[03:17:11.596 --> 03:17:14.079]  Just get honest, wake up before it's too late.
[03:17:14.079 --> 03:17:16.882]  Here's the eco-snoop lady telling you how great it is.
[03:17:22.802 --> 03:17:29.909]  Hi, I'm Stacey and welcome to the Appensee Press, your source for quality mobile application reviews and news.
[03:17:29.909 --> 03:17:37.776]  Have you ever walked down a city street long after all the businesses have closed, looked up at a quiet office building and seen all the lights still on?
[03:17:37.776 --> 03:17:46.164]  Or maybe headed into the restroom at your favorite restaurant and you notice that the faucet is stuck at a steady drip, wasting gallons of water each and every day.
[03:17:46.937 --> 03:17:54.385]  EcoSnoop is the first iPhone application on the market to put environmental activism in the hands of the everyday citizen.
[03:17:54.385 --> 03:17:58.529]  It's simple to use and works with any iPhone or iPod touch.
[03:17:58.529 --> 03:18:04.315]  Through EcoSnoop, the feet-on-the-street environmentalist can tag and report environmental issues wherever they go.
[03:18:05.393 --> 03:18:06.153]  Let's try it out.
[03:18:06.153 --> 03:18:11.115]  Let's say we're walking past that same building with the lights on again.
[03:18:11.115 --> 03:18:12.455]  Good pause.
[03:18:12.455 --> 03:18:16.876]  Yeah, in Austin, if you park an SUV at a city park, there's broken glass everywhere.
[03:18:16.876 --> 03:18:19.477]  They knife your tires and bust your window out.
[03:18:19.477 --> 03:18:23.258]  All over the country, phony environmentalists burn down new houses being built.
[03:18:24.346 --> 03:18:33.274]  And then she talks in here about, and it's on their website, about, this is just a reviewer, mobs of them, mobbing businesses and harassing them.
[03:18:33.274 --> 03:18:35.316]  Just what Webster Tarpley talked about.
[03:18:35.316 --> 03:18:36.617]  This is fascism.
[03:18:36.617 --> 03:18:38.438]  This is Stalinism.
[03:18:38.438 --> 03:18:39.239]  This is communism.
[03:18:39.239 --> 03:18:40.140]  It's all the same.
[03:18:40.140 --> 03:18:41.080]  Command and control.
[03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:42.762]  Let's go out to break with the rest of it.
[03:18:42.762 --> 03:18:43.703]  Here's how it works.
[03:18:43.703 --> 03:18:45.264]  And then you see the tattling.
[03:18:45.264 --> 03:18:46.105]  Look at this neighbor.
[03:18:46.305 --> 03:18:47.606]  Their grass is too long.
[03:18:47.606 --> 03:18:49.267]  I'm calling the police on them.
[03:18:49.267 --> 03:18:50.627]  I'm taking photos of them.
[03:18:50.627 --> 03:18:56.530]  Why don't you go tattle on some real corruption, like government corruption, or government waste?
[03:18:56.530 --> 03:18:58.271]  You're too stupid!
[03:18:58.271 --> 03:18:59.312]  Go back to them.
[03:18:59.312 --> 03:19:02.974]  This time, we have EcoSnoop on our iPhone.
[03:19:02.974 --> 03:19:06.416]  Simply open EcoSnoop and snap a photo of the offense.
[03:19:07.219 --> 03:19:07.619]  The offense!
[03:19:07.619 --> 03:19:07.880]  The case!
[03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:09.401]  Notice how it's all in criminal terminology.
[03:19:33.599 --> 03:19:35.120]  The case!
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:36.481]  And you go to the site, it says that.
[03:19:36.481 --> 03:19:38.362]  It's all for criminal filing.
[03:19:38.362 --> 03:19:43.645]  And they're already bringing in systems for spying on your neighbors, you name it, that are automated.
[03:19:43.645 --> 03:19:46.766]  And by law, all citizens will have to spy on each other.
[03:19:46.766 --> 03:19:48.087]  I have submitted.
[03:19:48.087 --> 03:19:48.968]  I can't watch anymore.
[03:19:48.968 --> 03:19:49.908]  Get her off the screen!
[03:19:49.908 --> 03:19:50.909]  Get her off!
[03:19:50.909 --> 03:19:52.510]  Doesn't that airhead realize what she's conjuring?
[03:20:02.355 --> 03:20:04.117]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:20:04.117 --> 03:20:06.539]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:20:06.539 --> 03:20:10.082]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:20:10.082 --> 03:20:14.867]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:20:14.867 --> 03:20:20.032]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:20:20.612 --> 03:20:25.115]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:20:25.115 --> 03:20:31.559]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:20:31.559 --> 03:20:33.201]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:20:33.201 --> 03:20:36.603]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[03:20:36.923 --> 03:20:37.324]  I think so.
[03:21:01.599 --> 03:21:11.627]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:11.627 --> 03:21:18.052]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:21:18.052 --> 03:21:26.919]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:27.279 --> 03:21:36.463]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:36.463 --> 03:21:41.064]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:41.064 --> 03:21:42.865]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:42.865 --> 03:21:45.366]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:21:45.666 --> 03:21:46.686]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:46.686 --> 03:21:53.148]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:21:53.148 --> 03:21:53.788]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:53.788 --> 03:21:54.209]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:54.209 --> 03:21:57.029]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:57.029 --> 03:21:59.350]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:59.350 --> 03:22:00.330]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.296 --> 03:22:14.959]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.959 --> 03:22:21.364]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.364 --> 03:22:26.549]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.549 --> 03:22:29.832]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:29.832 --> 03:22:36.538]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.658 --> 03:22:38.999]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.999 --> 03:22:40.580]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.580 --> 03:22:43.041]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.041 --> 03:22:45.182]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.182 --> 03:22:50.304]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.304 --> 03:23:01.669]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:01.669 --> 03:23:02.329]  Studies have shown
[03:23:09.394 --> 03:23:09.794]  We're good.
[03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:33.640]  We're good to go.
[03:24:07.472 --> 03:24:08.673]  Look at that control freak.
[03:24:08.673 --> 03:24:18.263]  She's got the same look in her eyes as that reporter with the National Post in Canada that called for a global government to enforce one-child policies.
[03:24:18.263 --> 03:24:22.488]  The same day it was announced in papers all over the world, the Communist Chinese government called for it.
[03:24:23.732 --> 03:24:26.316]  This is how we spy on everyone.
[03:24:26.316 --> 03:24:29.740]  This is how you file the offense and the report.
[03:24:29.740 --> 03:24:32.123]  And then you go there and it's like, look at my neighbor.
[03:24:32.123 --> 03:24:34.667]  Their yard isn't cut properly.
[03:24:34.667 --> 03:24:39.093]  And it's vines growing around a tree like they're supposed to.
[03:24:39.093 --> 03:24:39.914]  Oh, but this person...
[03:24:40.851 --> 03:24:44.412]  Doesn't care if there's open-air genetic engineering being planted.
[03:24:44.412 --> 03:24:49.654]  This person doesn't care if DU's being used at proving grounds all over the country and the world.
[03:24:49.654 --> 03:24:54.916]  This person doesn't care if the government's completely out of control, or secret arrests are going on, or U.S.
[03:24:54.916 --> 03:24:59.638]  citizens are being tortured and already held in camps.
[03:24:59.638 --> 03:25:02.159]  We just had Dr. Paul Craig Robertson listing it!
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:05.241]  The camps are already in the US!
[03:25:05.241 --> 03:25:07.442]  Special federal prisons!
[03:25:07.442 --> 03:25:08.942]  No due process!
[03:25:08.942 --> 03:25:10.283]  They don't care about that!
[03:25:10.283 --> 03:25:12.904]  Look, someone has their lights on!
[03:25:12.904 --> 03:25:13.704]  Look!
[03:25:13.704 --> 03:25:15.324]  There's an SUV!
[03:25:15.324 --> 03:25:15.985]  Stiletto!
[03:25:15.985 --> 03:25:23.147]  I don't know about these freaks with the review or this eco-snoop, but I know what the fake environmentalists are around here.
[03:25:23.147 --> 03:25:27.409]  Bunch of control freaks who want to run your life!
[03:25:27.409 --> 03:25:32.851]  I'm going to come back and hit the decade of tyranny, and then I'm going to get into George Washington, which I know these people are really going to hate.
[03:25:34.887 --> 03:25:37.508]  Oh my God, he owns slaves!
[03:25:37.508 --> 03:25:40.029]  Oh my gosh!
[03:25:40.029 --> 03:25:42.450]  It's horrible!
[03:25:42.450 --> 03:25:45.050]  He was bad!
[03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:50.352]  Yeah, and they still own slaves in Africa and the Middle East.
[03:25:50.352 --> 03:25:58.695]  And George Washington wrote heavily on slavery and said that it should be abolished, and if you were going to have it, it should be like the Bible, where the slave owner was a slave to his slaves.
[03:25:59.531 --> 03:26:00.932]  It's not all the Roots image.
[03:26:00.932 --> 03:26:02.733]  Slavery was a horrible institution.
[03:26:02.733 --> 03:26:07.116]  The point is, the West adopted it, but the West also tried to end it.
[03:26:07.116 --> 03:26:12.259]  You're not taught that by all the Ford Foundation people who want you to be a slave under communism.
[03:26:12.259 --> 03:26:14.060]  Have you read the Communist Manifesto?
[03:26:14.060 --> 03:26:20.925]  Have you read Hillary Clinton's now-declassified treatise to Saul Alinsky about how she wants you to live in work brigades, basically?
[03:26:20.925 --> 03:26:23.006]  Incredible article written for InfoWars.com.
[03:26:24.147 --> 03:26:27.449]  Hillary Clinton on Saul Alinsky, the revelation of the method.
[03:26:27.449 --> 03:26:29.411]  Good job to that person writing that.
[03:26:29.411 --> 03:26:32.253]  It's up on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:26:32.253 --> 03:26:34.715]  I mean, it's like, you know, communists are taking over.
[03:26:34.715 --> 03:26:35.195]  Oh, really?
[03:26:35.195 --> 03:26:37.697]  The imaginary kind?
[03:26:37.697 --> 03:26:40.078]  Oh, you mean the government openly?
[03:26:40.078 --> 03:26:41.339]  All of them being admitted communists?
[03:26:41.339 --> 03:26:42.480]  You mean them?
[03:26:42.480 --> 03:26:45.702]  Who all wrote their PhD thesis on communism?
[03:26:45.702 --> 03:26:46.843]  And who are now setting it up?
[03:26:46.843 --> 03:26:47.324]  You mean them?
[03:26:48.459 --> 03:26:50.900]  But communism's for the people!
[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:56.704]  Yeah, that the bankers send in to murder everybody and take their property.
[03:26:56.704 --> 03:27:02.907]  You idiots out there, I'm talking about new listeners, you better wake up fast, okay?
[03:27:02.907 --> 03:27:05.869]  We're not going to break and come back with all this news.
[03:27:05.869 --> 03:27:08.070]  I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com.
[03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:09.991]  If you want to be dependent on the government, go ahead.
[03:27:09.991 --> 03:27:13.934]  If you're like me, you want firearms and storable food.
[03:27:14.858 --> 03:27:18.439]  Not that I'm clutching it, and only relying on it like Obama said.
[03:27:18.439 --> 03:27:21.621]  People clutching their Bibles and their guns, and everybody laughing.
[03:27:21.621 --> 03:27:23.361]  Ha ha ha, we'll soon get them!
[03:27:23.361 --> 03:27:25.942]  They're the last link between us and total control!
[03:27:25.942 --> 03:27:26.923]  The Red Terror!
[03:27:26.923 --> 03:27:28.843]  Oh God, it's almost ours!
[03:27:28.843 --> 03:27:30.364]  Well, yes.
[03:27:30.364 --> 03:27:35.586]  No, they're just there in case I need them.
[03:27:35.586 --> 03:27:38.247]  The bitter clingers, clinging their Bibles and their guns.
[03:27:39.332 --> 03:27:44.235]  I got the storable food and the guns, high quality, because I have the responsibility to take care of my family.
[03:27:44.235 --> 03:27:49.819]  And if you think I trust the state and the government with all the stuff going on to do it, you're crazy.
[03:27:49.819 --> 03:27:54.362]  Give eFoodsDirect.com a call or check out their website, eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:27:54.362 --> 03:27:58.325]  They got a bunch of new lines of great food, organic, you name it, super high quality.
[03:27:58.325 --> 03:27:59.526]  eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[03:27:59.526 --> 03:27:59.566]  800-409-5633!
[03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:08.011]  Continuing, there's also FrontSight.com.
[03:28:08.011 --> 03:28:12.915]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the FrontSight Firearms Training Institute?
[03:28:12.915 --> 03:28:17.619]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[03:28:17.619 --> 03:28:23.663]  Think of all the communist mothers out there with their little disarmed children, little 10-year-old boys afraid of toy guns.
[03:28:23.663 --> 03:28:25.525]  They're hearing us talking about giving out free guns.
[03:28:26.025 --> 03:28:27.607]  Oh, I'm a little communist.
[03:28:27.607 --> 03:28:30.770]  I've trained my kids to be slaves and victims to the state.
[03:28:30.770 --> 03:28:33.813]  Trained to be easy pickings for the red terror that's coming.
[03:28:33.813 --> 03:28:35.275]  And I'm talking about firearms!
[03:28:37.162 --> 03:28:44.549]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[03:28:44.549 --> 03:28:46.251]  And it won't last forever, so listen up.
[03:28:46.251 --> 03:28:51.156]  This is non-drill instructor, non-tough guy attitude family training at the Firearms Training Institute.
[03:28:51.156 --> 03:28:53.658]  That's Front Sight, like the front of your rifle.
[03:28:53.658 --> 03:28:55.960]  FrontSight.com.
[03:28:55.960 --> 03:28:57.202]  Free men are armed.
[03:28:57.202 --> 03:28:58.903]  Slaves are disarmed.
[03:28:58.903 --> 03:29:00.024]  You ever figure that out?
[03:29:00.024 --> 03:29:00.885]  FrontSight.com.
[03:29:02.831 --> 03:29:05.576]  And finally, survivalseedbank.com.
[03:29:05.576 --> 03:29:15.373]  I believe in being self-sufficient, and I believe in training your children how to grow plants, even though that's in no sense a conspiracy theory that you can grow plants outside an agribusiness.
[03:29:17.261 --> 03:29:32.204]  They say it's a conspiracy theory that Liberty's good, but the point is, survivalseedbank.com, high quality survival seed banks, non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds, great deal, survivalseedbank.com from the great folks at Solutions for Science, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:29:32.204 --> 03:29:32.544]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:29:32.544 --> 03:29:35.565]  I'm going to go ahead and cover George Washington when we get back.
[03:29:41.866 --> 03:29:51.850]  Then, I'm gonna cover the decade of tyranny, and the decade coming up, the decade of resistance, and the decade after that, the decade of victory!
[03:29:51.850 --> 03:29:55.772]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.772 --> 03:29:58.473]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.206 --> 03:30:05.327]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:05.327 --> 03:30:08.188]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:08.188 --> 03:30:09.468]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:30:09.468 --> 03:30:10.289]  It's very real.
[03:30:10.289 --> 03:30:12.529]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:12.529 --> 03:30:14.170]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:30:14.170 --> 03:30:18.651]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:31:00.928 --> 03:31:05.473]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:31:05.473 --> 03:31:06.394]  Number one.
[03:31:06.394 --> 03:31:09.817]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:31:09.817 --> 03:31:10.678]  Number two.
[03:31:10.678 --> 03:31:15.563]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:31:15.563 --> 03:31:16.324]  It's true.
[03:31:16.324 --> 03:31:20.869]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:31:21.169 --> 03:31:21.990]  Number 3.
[03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:25.572]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:31:25.572 --> 03:31:29.495]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:31:29.495 --> 03:31:30.296]  Number 4.
[03:31:30.296 --> 03:31:33.057]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:31:33.057 --> 03:31:36.740]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:31:36.740 --> 03:31:37.521]  Number 5.
[03:31:37.521 --> 03:31:41.663]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:31:41.663 --> 03:31:46.427]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:32:53.973 --> 03:32:56.734]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:33:09.995 --> 03:33:17.578]  I can hear the echo of a thousand ringing bells.
[03:33:17.578 --> 03:33:25.240]  I can smell the cannons and hear the people's yells.
[03:33:25.240 --> 03:33:33.343]  Long live George Washington, their ghostly voices say.
[03:33:33.343 --> 03:33:37.925]  And I still feel his spirit to this very day.
[03:33:41.208 --> 03:33:47.115]  And I can see a young boy, growing straight and tall.
[03:33:47.115 --> 03:33:54.743]  And as I watch him hunt and ride, I've no doubt at all, it won't be long till he's full grown.
[03:33:54.743 --> 03:34:00.028]  And then will come the day, he'll become the President of the USA.
[03:34:02.811 --> 03:34:07.236]  Long live George Washington, I hear the people say.
[03:34:07.236 --> 03:34:10.840]  He's the first and greatest president of the USA.
[03:34:14.079 --> 03:34:16.060]  Absolutely amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:34:16.060 --> 03:34:18.780]  That's Fess Parker.
[03:34:18.780 --> 03:34:23.021]  We are bringing George Washington back.
[03:34:23.021 --> 03:34:24.021]  A real hero.
[03:34:24.021 --> 03:34:27.742]  Not Roger Stolbeck.
[03:34:27.742 --> 03:34:29.483]  Not Michael Jordan.
[03:34:29.483 --> 03:34:30.043]  Hey, great.
[03:34:30.043 --> 03:34:31.063]  They can catch a ball.
[03:34:31.063 --> 03:34:31.843]  They can hit a ball.
[03:34:31.843 --> 03:34:33.684]  They can throw a ball through a hoop.
[03:34:33.684 --> 03:34:34.784]  That isn't what matters.
[03:34:34.784 --> 03:34:39.005]  You need to rediscover what this country is really all about.
[03:34:39.918 --> 03:34:54.492]  Now before I get into George Washington and why the establishment hates him and why they don't really teach about him in school anymore or just tell you about his teeth being wooden and making fun of him, why the establishment is doing this, because if you actually read what he said
[03:34:56.292 --> 03:34:59.855]  Learn what he did and rediscover what America is.
[03:34:59.855 --> 03:35:04.578]  You know that it is the opposite of what government is today.
[03:35:04.578 --> 03:35:10.442]  And that if George Washington was alive today, he would probably already be in a shooting war with the government.
[03:35:10.442 --> 03:35:12.623]  Because the government is illegitimate and criminal.
[03:35:12.623 --> 03:35:13.964]  But we're in a different world.
[03:35:13.964 --> 03:35:19.288]  We need to circumvent that as long as we can and hopefully avert it.
[03:35:19.288 --> 03:35:21.590]  But it is time for all the corrupt people out there
[03:35:22.674 --> 03:35:39.800]  Who have never really had it laid out in front of them, the real choices to make their decision and decide who they stand with, the spirit of 1776 and George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or with David Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, the New World Order.
[03:35:39.800 --> 03:35:42.501]  Now is the time to choose.
[03:35:42.501 --> 03:35:49.523]  Now is the time to relearn that incredible wisdom of the true revolutionary trailblazers, our founding fathers.
[03:35:50.478 --> 03:35:56.102]  Chief among them, General George Washington.
[03:35:56.102 --> 03:36:05.749]  So I want to play this clip of a breakdown by a historian in a live speech just a few months ago of George Washington.
[03:36:05.749 --> 03:36:10.032]  I'm quite the history buff on the Revolutionary War compared to the general public.
[03:36:10.032 --> 03:36:10.873]  It's so massive.
[03:36:10.873 --> 03:36:12.194]  I'm really a novice.
[03:36:12.194 --> 03:36:15.656]  This is very accurate about the Founding Fathers.
[03:36:15.656 --> 03:36:17.798]  For any of you that think you don't have the metal
[03:36:18.218 --> 03:36:19.979]  We tend to see them, not just the people
[03:36:42.179 --> 03:36:44.341]  Who's figure in history books?
[03:36:44.341 --> 03:36:50.327]  Adams, Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Rush, and of course Washington.
[03:36:50.327 --> 03:36:55.391]  We tend to see them as sort of figures in a costume pageant.
[03:36:55.391 --> 03:36:56.833]  It's often the way they're portrayed.
[03:36:58.160 --> 03:37:07.984]  And we tend to see them as much older than they were because we're seeing them in the portraits of Gilbert Stuart and others when they were truly the founding fathers.
[03:37:07.984 --> 03:37:12.786]  And furthermore, none of them had had any prior experience in revolutions.
[03:37:12.786 --> 03:37:20.029]  They weren't experienced revolutionaries who'd flown in to take part in this biggest of all events.
[03:37:20.029 --> 03:37:21.750]  They were winging it.
[03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:22.750]  They were improvising.
[03:37:23.686 --> 03:37:26.128]  At the time of the Revolution, they were all young.
[03:37:26.128 --> 03:37:29.950]  It was a young man's, young woman's cause.
[03:37:29.950 --> 03:37:35.594]  George Washington took command of the Continental Army in the summer of 1775 at the age of 43.
[03:37:35.594 --> 03:37:38.495]  He was the oldest of them.
[03:37:38.495 --> 03:37:39.876]  Adams was 40.
[03:37:39.876 --> 03:37:44.599]  Jefferson was all of 33 when he wrote the Declaration of Independence.
[03:37:44.599 --> 03:37:50.143]  And he wasn't chosen by his fellow members of the Continental Congress because he was a great military person.
[03:37:51.226 --> 03:37:53.767]  He was chosen because they knew him.
[03:37:53.767 --> 03:37:55.368]  They knew the kind of man he was.
[03:37:55.368 --> 03:37:58.690]  They knew his character, his integrity.
[03:37:58.690 --> 03:38:03.072]  What Washington was, above all, was a leader.
[03:38:03.072 --> 03:38:06.334]  He was a man people would follow.
[03:38:06.334 --> 03:38:16.200]  And as events would prove, he was a man whom some, a few, would follow through hell.
[03:38:17.333 --> 03:38:20.677]  And he would not give up.
[03:38:20.677 --> 03:38:23.399]  He would not quit.
[03:38:23.399 --> 03:38:25.622]  The army was totally demoralized.
[03:38:25.622 --> 03:38:27.063]  They'd been defeated.
[03:38:27.063 --> 03:38:28.204]  They were soaking wet.
[03:38:28.204 --> 03:38:29.185]  They were cold.
[03:38:29.185 --> 03:38:30.667]  They were hungry.
[03:38:30.667 --> 03:38:38.415]  And by the time Washington started his big retreat, his long retreat across New Jersey, they were down to only a few thousand men.
[03:38:38.415 --> 03:38:40.217]  That's all.
[03:38:41.226 --> 03:38:58.731]  Well, Washington took stock, just as the British Army was taking stock of what the situation was, and most every officer and all the politicians, many of whom had fled from Philadelphia by this time, and most everybody concluded that the war was over and we had lost.
[03:38:58.731 --> 03:39:02.672]  It was the only rational conclusion one could come to.
[03:39:02.672 --> 03:39:05.553]  There wasn't a chance.
[03:39:05.553 --> 03:39:09.994]  So, Washington did what you sometimes have to do when everything's lost and all hope's gone.
[03:39:10.905 --> 03:39:13.446]  He attacked.
[03:39:13.446 --> 03:39:19.627]  They went up the river Christmas night, nine miles up to McConkie's Ferry.
[03:39:19.627 --> 03:39:20.988]  They crossed the Delaware.
[03:39:20.988 --> 03:39:28.750]  He had the nerve, the courage, the faith in the cause to carry the war once more to the enemy.
[03:39:28.750 --> 03:39:35.211]  And they marched nine miles back down the river on the eastern side and struck at Trenton the next morning.
[03:39:35.211 --> 03:39:36.792]  It was a fierce house-to-house
[03:39:37.972 --> 03:39:39.313]  Savage battle.
[03:39:39.313 --> 03:39:41.334]  Small in scale.
[03:39:41.334 --> 03:39:42.995]  Very, very severe.
[03:39:42.995 --> 03:39:46.376]  And it was all over in about 45 minutes and we won.
[03:39:46.376 --> 03:39:48.377]  For the first time.
[03:39:48.377 --> 03:39:52.519]  Now it wasn't a great battle like Brooklyn.
[03:39:52.519 --> 03:39:55.861]  This was a small engagement.
[03:39:55.861 --> 03:39:59.203]  But its consequences were enormous.
[03:39:59.203 --> 03:40:00.764]  Beyond reckoning.
[03:40:00.764 --> 03:40:02.585]  Because of the psychological effect.
[03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:08.553]  It transformed the attitude of the Army and of much of the country toward the war.
[03:40:08.553 --> 03:40:12.836]  And in that, it was a pivotal turning point.
[03:40:12.836 --> 03:40:19.000]  Washington, the political general, had never forgotten that Congress was boss.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:29.546]  When the war was at last over, Washington, in one of the most important events in our entire history, turned back his command to the Congress.
[03:40:29.546 --> 03:40:32.348]  No conquering general had done that before.
[03:40:33.697 --> 03:40:45.300]  When George III heard that George Washington might do this, King George III said, if he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.
[03:40:45.300 --> 03:40:46.300]  So what does it tell us?
[03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:53.402]  It tells us that the original decision of the Continental Congress was the wise one.
[03:40:53.402 --> 03:40:54.582]  They knew the man.
[03:40:54.582 --> 03:40:56.342]  They knew his character.
[03:40:56.342 --> 03:40:59.043]  And he lived up to his reputation.
[03:41:03.607 --> 03:41:06.709]  Now compare that to what we've turned into today.
[03:41:06.709 --> 03:41:11.173]  We need to rediscover true liberty, true freedom, and virtue.
[03:41:12.415 --> 03:41:15.876]  And we need to understand that the globalists are not invincible.
[03:41:15.876 --> 03:41:20.858]  With all their lies and corruption and manipulation, they're in control of the left and the right.
[03:41:20.858 --> 03:41:23.019]  We just had a giant victory.
[03:41:23.019 --> 03:41:31.142]  Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN, Herman Van Rompuy, head of the EU, announced global government is now being established.
[03:41:31.142 --> 03:41:33.722]  We're going to levy global carbon taxes.
[03:41:33.722 --> 03:41:36.884]  We're going to shut down industrial society.
[03:41:36.884 --> 03:41:38.104]  All announced this on TV.
[03:41:38.104 --> 03:41:39.685]  They said, we will pass it.
[03:41:39.685 --> 03:41:40.545]  And they failed.
[03:41:42.059 --> 03:41:45.560]  Because the fraud was leaked, and we're having many other victories.
[03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:56.305]  And in my experience, every time we fight, if we fight and fight and fight and persevere, if we lose 20 times, and on the 21st time win, we win.
[03:41:56.305 --> 03:42:03.267]  It is the act of resistance that is victory, when you have right on your side.
[03:42:03.267 --> 03:42:06.028]  Hundreds of battles were fought by the colonies.
[03:42:06.028 --> 03:42:09.170]  And you could do the numbers, but maybe one out of 15,
[03:42:11.336 --> 03:42:21.779]  That's a guesstimation, because some battles it wasn't exactly clear who won, but the vast majority were won by the Crown.
[03:42:21.779 --> 03:42:33.582]  But it was the perseverance, and it was waiting till the main British army was tied down with the French, and when their main fleet had been destroyed in the Atlantic.
[03:42:33.582 --> 03:42:37.983]  It was the fact that they bankrupt the coffers of King George III.
[03:42:39.494 --> 03:42:43.378]  And Hamilton and others came to Washington.
[03:42:43.378 --> 03:42:46.781]  What they don't tell you in that little short piece is they said, we want you to be king.
[03:42:46.781 --> 03:42:48.583]  A large contingent.
[03:42:48.583 --> 03:42:50.565]  And he said, no.
[03:42:50.565 --> 03:42:51.165]  And he left.
[03:42:51.165 --> 03:42:55.649]  He didn't want to be president, but the people wanted it.
[03:42:55.649 --> 03:42:57.491]  And then the second election, he got voted in.
[03:42:57.491 --> 03:42:59.733]  That's what the people wanted.
[03:42:59.733 --> 03:43:01.415]  He couldn't wait to get out of Washington.
[03:43:02.628 --> 03:43:06.772]  And in his farewell address, he said, don't get involved as an empire.
[03:43:06.772 --> 03:43:09.775]  Don't join alliances with other countries.
[03:43:09.775 --> 03:43:11.316]  They will come in and take us over.
[03:43:11.316 --> 03:43:13.358]  They will bring us down.
[03:43:13.358 --> 03:43:20.544]  Because the French had tried to come in and do that during his first and second term.
[03:43:20.544 --> 03:43:26.670]  And he went home, to his farm, and died two years later.
[03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:28.672]  He was offered to be the king of America.
[03:43:29.568 --> 03:43:31.569]  That's why Mexico's so corrupt today.
[03:43:31.569 --> 03:43:32.329]  They had kings.
[03:43:32.329 --> 03:43:35.510]  They had Austrian-Hungarian Empire kings.
[03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:38.712]  The kings of Europe would send their princelings there.
[03:43:38.712 --> 03:43:43.274]  And Mexico's run by a ruling shadow oligarchy today.
[03:43:43.274 --> 03:43:45.674]  Every other country has scum running it.
[03:43:45.674 --> 03:43:49.356]  North Korea.
[03:43:49.356 --> 03:43:53.117]  Everywhere.
[03:43:53.117 --> 03:43:54.758]  China has a bunch of corrupt thugs.
[03:43:54.758 --> 03:43:57.639]  Their people are good, but they didn't have George Washington.
[03:43:57.639 --> 03:43:58.940]  They didn't have Thomas Jefferson.
[03:43:59.895 --> 03:44:04.456]  The French and their revolution was a wicked counterfeit of what happened here.
[03:44:04.456 --> 03:44:09.358]  And they attempted to take that over through Washington and he said no later.
[03:44:09.358 --> 03:44:12.439]  And that's a whole other history.
[03:44:12.439 --> 03:44:18.201]  But I think about how domesticated we've become in this country.
[03:44:18.201 --> 03:44:27.624]  I think about how all over the country I see the reports, I talk to parents, I meet parents where they're scared of an orange Nerf gun.
[03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:33.994]  Where the schools are banning tag and dodgeball and hugging or talking.
[03:44:33.994 --> 03:44:38.037]  We're all becoming prisoners under a psychiatric dictatorship.
[03:44:38.037 --> 03:44:41.560]  Mothers think it's good to make their sons and daughters cowards and helpless.
[03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:54.311]  To raise them up to be hapless weaklings like legless and armless gerbils in a cage, disarmed, defanged, so the boa constrictors of big government can eat them at their leisure.
[03:44:58.331 --> 03:45:00.853]  Rediscover the spirit of 1776.
[03:45:00.853 --> 03:45:03.914]  Rediscover who your ancestors are.
[03:45:03.914 --> 03:45:08.437]  Rediscover what freedom really is.
[03:45:08.437 --> 03:45:16.922]  You know, in my film, Police State to the Takeover, we show government training manuals demonizing the Founding Fathers.
[03:45:16.922 --> 03:45:24.307]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, we have footage of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin being called terrorist by FEMA, brainwashing police.
[03:45:26.428 --> 03:45:40.131]  We've released over the years, that's been leaked to us, scores of inside government training manuals demonizing veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, real liberals, who are against war, not the fake establishment type.
[03:45:40.131 --> 03:45:42.091]  You are the target of this criminal group.
[03:45:42.091 --> 03:45:43.151]  They know history.
[03:45:43.151 --> 03:45:47.512]  They know their history, and they know our history, and they know what they've got to destroy.
[03:45:47.512 --> 03:45:49.253]  They know what they've got to bring down.
[03:45:49.253 --> 03:45:50.553]  They know what they've got to demonize.
[03:45:51.869 --> 03:46:03.879]  But the way they've destroyed the image of George Washington is showing, you know, one of the final portraits of him, an old man, big lips, big mouth, big ivory, painful teeth.
[03:46:03.879 --> 03:46:05.300]  He really had ivory teeth, not wooden.
[03:46:05.300 --> 03:46:13.447]  You know, all the battle wounds he had going back when he was in the militia and fighting the French.
[03:46:13.447 --> 03:46:17.070]  They show that image of an old man and they teach you in school that he had teeth that hurt.
[03:46:18.075 --> 03:46:20.059]  And that he got bled to death.
[03:46:20.059 --> 03:46:21.602]  And that's all you're taught.
[03:46:21.602 --> 03:46:23.405]  It's just some boring stuffy guy.
[03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:47.315]  They don't want you to know what founded this country, or they want to demonize the founders and talk about the problems and the bad things they did, which were there, but compared to their contemporaries around the world, these were the highest expression of the Renaissance, the highest expression of virtue, the highest expression of humanity, the highest expression of the Greek philosophers.
[03:46:47.315 --> 03:46:48.236]  I've studied it all.
[03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:54.023]  And it's not hype when you talk about our founding fathers and how great they were.
[03:46:54.023 --> 03:46:55.644]  The world marveled.
[03:46:55.644 --> 03:47:02.409]  The King of England said, he is the greatest man in the world.
[03:47:02.409 --> 03:47:06.592]  George Washington.
[03:47:06.592 --> 03:47:08.873]  Turning down kingship.
[03:47:08.873 --> 03:47:14.297]  Turning down the British payoff.
[03:47:14.297 --> 03:47:15.638]  The King of England called in
[03:47:18.556 --> 03:47:19.657]  Several U.S.
[03:47:19.657 --> 03:47:32.283]  ambassadors, one of them Adams, and said, you're going to need a king even if you win this thing in the future.
[03:47:32.283 --> 03:47:34.184]  The royalty really believed.
[03:47:34.184 --> 03:47:36.405]  They said, what about democracy?
[03:47:36.405 --> 03:47:38.806]  51% will vote to rob the other 49%.
[03:47:38.806 --> 03:47:39.947]  The howl of the mob.
[03:47:39.947 --> 03:47:41.508]  They said, no, we have a republic.
[03:47:42.489 --> 03:47:44.371]  Where everyone's rights are protected.
[03:47:44.371 --> 03:47:51.337]  And that's why they've now replaced the Republic with the Democracy.
[03:47:51.337 --> 03:47:57.843]  If 51% say kill the other 49, it happens.
[03:47:57.843 --> 03:48:06.770]  And I want to read to you two different quotes attributed, confirmed to George Washington in letters and speeches, different variants of this.
[03:48:06.770 --> 03:48:08.172]  Unhappy it is, this is 1775,
[03:48:10.632 --> 03:48:13.295]  After Lessington and Concord, the massacres.
[03:48:13.295 --> 03:48:27.110]  Unhappy it is, though, to reflect that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves.
[03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:31.554]  Sad alternative, but can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?
[03:48:32.395 --> 03:48:35.860]  George Washington after the battles of Lexington and Concord.
[03:48:35.860 --> 03:48:44.331]  Washington also repeatedly made the similar statement, but shorter, that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves of our own government.
[03:48:44.331 --> 03:48:48.517]  He said that in 1776 once he took command of the Continental Army.
[03:48:50.686 --> 03:49:09.297]  And so FEMA is right to hate George Washington because it is an alien, illegitimate, criminal, corporate receivership arm taking our country by fraud into bankruptcy and perfecting a neo-feudalistic form of serfdom.
[03:49:10.245 --> 03:49:26.971]  Of shutting off people's resources through artificial scarcity and monopoly capitalism to create an ultra-super elite and shut down all their competition and have one-child policies and bring in a form of tyranny never dreamed of over man.
[03:49:26.971 --> 03:49:34.174]  In all the government textbooks, in all their reports, in all their own statements.
[03:49:35.831 --> 03:49:48.038]  This is a group of vicious, wicked, greedy, control freaks versus free humanity that just wants to live and be comfortable and be free and be left alone.
[03:49:48.038 --> 03:49:50.199]  Well, you're not going to be left alone.
[03:49:50.199 --> 03:49:53.261]  George Washington wanted to be left alone.
[03:49:53.261 --> 03:50:00.525]  But government grew and grew and grew and the bureaucrats were rude and they violated the laws and they were corrupt and they did whatever they wanted.
[03:50:02.318 --> 03:50:11.364]  And when police shot innocent unarmed citizens, men back then got angry and they went to war.
[03:50:11.364 --> 03:50:13.565]  And these were men who owned a lot of property.
[03:50:13.565 --> 03:50:16.407]  They were members of the establishment, but they understood tyranny.
[03:50:18.968 --> 03:50:29.394]  There's another big reason men haven't risen up quicker, and that is because, and it's now been on Fox News, and now in Japan, and on, oh, they want to put lithium in your water, an anti-psych.
[03:50:29.394 --> 03:50:31.575]  Oh, they want to put Prozac, they're testing it.
[03:50:31.575 --> 03:50:34.877]  Oh, they want to put, what do you think sodium fluoride does?
[03:50:34.877 --> 03:50:38.159]  Why do you think your sperm counts down by over 85%?
[03:50:38.159 --> 03:50:39.600]  And they're bragging in the news.
[03:50:41.440 --> 03:50:42.941]  Oh, our fertility's dropping!
[03:50:42.941 --> 03:50:44.662]  We're becoming sterile!
[03:50:44.662 --> 03:50:49.845]  It's so great, and The Economist, how the population problem is solving itself.
[03:50:49.845 --> 03:50:58.810]  When you open it up, it says, oh, the dividends of the demographic change, how it's bringing big benefits.
[03:50:58.810 --> 03:51:00.951]  They're killing you with chemical weapons.
[03:51:03.090 --> 03:51:04.593]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:51:04.593 --> 03:51:08.599]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[03:51:08.599 --> 03:51:15.791]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love
[03:51:19.985 --> 03:51:20.426]  I don't know.

[03:51:49.491 --> 03:51:53.054]  We here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace, security and plenty this holiday season.
[03:52:03.212 --> 03:52:07.237]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.237 --> 03:52:10.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:11.882]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:15.261]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.261 --> 03:52:21.662]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.662 --> 03:52:27.204]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.204 --> 03:52:36.826]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.966 --> 03:52:39.308]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.308 --> 03:52:40.889]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.889 --> 03:52:43.352]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.352 --> 03:52:45.473]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.473 --> 03:52:50.638]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.638 --> 03:52:59.746]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:53:10.082 --> 03:53:14.285]  You can get help today from the leading tax expert in the country, Dan Pilla.

[03:54:03.612 --> 03:54:06.695]  The core message is unity.
[03:54:06.695 --> 03:54:09.057]  George Washington's the great unifier.
[03:54:09.057 --> 03:54:17.804]  He believes that the answer to how to have personal freedom and liberty is through a strong, united government.
[03:54:17.804 --> 03:54:19.926]  Don't love any country too much.
[03:54:19.926 --> 03:54:21.967]  Don't hate any country too much.
[03:54:21.967 --> 03:54:25.410]  Either one will lead you to act against your own interests.
[03:54:25.410 --> 03:54:31.535]  The goal is to establish an independent America, a strong, united America.
[03:54:32.436 --> 03:54:39.879]  In 1797, George Washington handed over the presidency, and returned to his beloved Mount Vernon.
[03:54:39.879 --> 03:54:46.001]  For two years he enjoyed life, receiving a steady stream of visitors, and tending his plantation.
[03:54:46.001 --> 03:54:50.043]  Then early one winter morning, he rode out to inspect his estate.
[03:54:50.043 --> 03:54:53.584]  When he returned, he complained of a sore throat.
[03:54:53.584 --> 03:54:58.066]  A fever developed, and two days later, on the 14th of December, 1799, he died.
[03:55:01.064 --> 03:55:08.466]  He was 67 years old.
[03:55:08.466 --> 03:55:10.166]  Okay, folks.
[03:55:10.166 --> 03:55:21.568]  The issue here is, we're told that we have to constantly support other governments, get involved in wars, but that's the opposite of what George Washington said.
[03:55:21.568 --> 03:55:24.189]  But again, he's not a real American.
[03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:27.810]  Maybe he's Al-Qaeda, like FEMA teaches.
[03:55:28.942 --> 03:55:31.304]  How brainwashed are you police and military?
[03:55:31.304 --> 03:55:41.130]  George Washington's now bad, and Maury Strong and the UN, they're good.
[03:55:41.130 --> 03:55:44.852]  Well, we've got to give our rights up, because the underwear bomber.
[03:55:44.852 --> 03:55:48.335]  But you look at the evidence there, and that's clearly a staged event.
[03:55:48.335 --> 03:55:57.301]  You know, in the first hour of the show today... Well, first off, I'm going to be spending more time
[03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:00.822]  At least once a week, focusing in on a founding father.
[03:56:00.822 --> 03:56:05.785]  We'll go back over key founding fathers, little tidbits, history, more of their quotes.
[03:56:05.785 --> 03:56:07.986]  I've always done that, but not enough.
[03:56:07.986 --> 03:56:16.751]  We're gonna get into what America is so people know the difference between the tyranny, they don't know what tyranny is because they never were given a choice.
[03:56:16.751 --> 03:56:20.554]  They think checkpoints and secret arrest is freedom.
[03:56:20.554 --> 03:56:24.056]  They don't know what real freedom was.
[03:56:24.056 --> 03:56:25.817]  They don't know what our real history is.
[03:56:27.284 --> 03:56:28.665]  People don't have basic logic.
[03:56:28.665 --> 03:56:30.827]  They don't understand everything's not the way it's presented.
[03:56:30.827 --> 03:56:32.028]  Like, who was good?
[03:56:32.028 --> 03:56:33.649]  The North or the South?
[03:56:33.649 --> 03:56:35.631]  And the Civil War?
[03:56:35.631 --> 03:56:36.792]  Neither side.
[03:56:36.792 --> 03:56:45.519]  It was manipulated by British intelligence on both sides, and that's even mainline history, but not taught and not on mainline television.
[03:56:45.519 --> 03:56:49.963]  See, once people have a real view of history, it's all crystal.
[03:56:49.963 --> 03:56:53.466]  Once you learn this information, you can go out for yourself and know more than I do.
[03:56:57.605 --> 03:56:59.145]  But long live George Washington.
[03:56:59.145 --> 03:57:00.726]  What does that song mean?
[03:57:00.726 --> 03:57:03.567]  He's been dead for two hundred and something years.
[03:57:03.567 --> 03:57:11.669]  Two hundred and ten years.
[03:57:11.669 --> 03:57:14.049]  He's been dead for more than two centuries.
[03:57:14.049 --> 03:57:15.610]  Long live the idea.
[03:57:15.610 --> 03:57:16.890]  Long live real heroes.
[03:57:16.890 --> 03:57:23.532]  I mean, you go to the store and every
[03:57:24.614 --> 03:57:26.796]  Magazine is a distraction and diversion.
[03:57:26.796 --> 03:57:28.137]  Oh, Big 12 champions.
[03:57:28.137 --> 03:57:31.400]  Our hero isn't George Washington, it's Colt McCoy.
[03:57:31.400 --> 03:57:32.721]  Doesn't matter.
[03:57:32.721 --> 03:57:34.703]  Oh, look, for the intellectuals.
[03:57:34.703 --> 03:57:36.344]  Oh, we're all becoming sterilized.
[03:57:36.344 --> 03:57:37.425]  The Economist.
[03:57:37.425 --> 03:57:39.366]  Falling fertility, how great it is.
[03:57:39.366 --> 03:57:41.648]  No reason why it's happening, just in your face.
[03:57:41.648 --> 03:57:43.670]  Oh, Al Gore, he's a genius, he's gonna save us.
[03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:45.091]  The thinking man's thinking man.
[03:57:45.091 --> 03:57:47.053]  The eco-profit, world government.
[03:57:47.053 --> 03:57:49.475]  Oh, look, they call him Jesus in here.
[03:57:49.475 --> 03:57:50.476]  The hero gene.
[03:57:52.318 --> 03:57:58.222]  The heir to the Rothschild fortune, a complete demon.

[03:58:09.630 --> 03:58:13.852]  Knowing how the stock markets and the Federal Reserve work is what matters.
[03:58:13.852 --> 03:58:17.855]  Knowing we've killed over 50 million babies in this country is what matters.
[03:58:17.855 --> 03:58:21.257]  Knowing that if we stand up, we can beat these people, that's what matters.

[03:59:16.018 --> 03:59:18.140]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:59:32.768 --> 03:59:34.890]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
