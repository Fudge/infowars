[00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.121]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.882]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.642]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.222]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:12.123]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:16.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:21.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:50.423]  We have neurologist, brain surgeon, Dr. Russell Blaylock joining us to talk about vaccines and brain damage and their history of causing brain damage.
[00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:54.566]  That is coming up in the third hour today, two hours from now.
[00:00:54.566 --> 00:01:02.951]  I've got Tex Mars popping in because I wanted to get his take on the First Lady's mother doing voodoo rituals.
[00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:09.442]  According to multiple mainstream media reports at the White House.
[00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:11.943]  And why is the media getting so upset by this?
[00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:16.284]  I mean, the Bushes do the satanic skull and bones rituals.
[00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:23.506]  Most of the conservative Christian leaders go to Bohemian Grove for homosexual pagan rituals.
[00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:32.988]  Most of your, quote, liberals are into Aztec rebirthing rituals or classical European witchcraft, like Tony Blair and his wife, Sherry Blair.
[00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.915]  I mean, is this a racism issue?
[00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:40.237]  Is a voodoo code word for the n-word?
[00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:46.642]  I'm being a little bit sarcastic, but serious at the same time.
[00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:48.383]  The media will probably say that now.
[00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:56.149]  If you don't like chopping the heads off of chickens, you're a racist.
[00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.790]  By all means, join in immediately.
[00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.693]  Remember what happened with
[00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:06.745]  Hillary Clinton and the seances and the shaman.
[00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:09.808]  I mean, these people are just complete nutcases.
[00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:19.678]  You read all the official United Nations documents and treaties, it talks about occultic Gaia religions and the rest of it.
[00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:24.022]  So the truth is the atheistic world elite are not atheistic.
[00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:27.766]  They want you to be atheistic, but they are the most superstitious,
[00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:31.189]  Backward crew of people.
[00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.670]  You talk about old-time religion.
[00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.331]  They follow all the different faiths that predate Christianity.
[00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:41.071]  Just a fact.
[00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:44.132]  I'm just stating a fact here.
[00:02:44.132 --> 00:02:47.032]  So we're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:55.354]  Also, there's been a lot of concealed carry going on around the nation as people turn their
[00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:58.496]  Rights into a privilege.
[00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:11.999]  I'm not attacking you if you have a concealed carry, it's just that the corrupt illegitimate corporate state engages in a form of alchemy and they permit something that is illegal.
[00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:19.961]  Under common law, under the Bill of Rights and Constitution, concealing weapons is what criminals do.
[00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:26.262]  Free men bear arms openly and it causes very polite, very low crime level society.
[00:03:29.994 --> 00:03:41.142]  But then they trick you to turn your right into a privilege and get a permit for something that would be illegal and then that sends the message that guns, carrying guns, are illegal unless you do it concealed.
[00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:48.328]  So a complete perversion of the ancient common law and what we follow in this nation.
[00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:55.073]  And by that they create the practice and the perception that carrying firearms openly is illegal.
[00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:59.296]  You try to drive down the road in Texas with a rifle in your pickup truck
[00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:02.005]  Rifle rack even in the country.
[00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:05.687]  Cops will pull you over a lot of times.
[00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:17.735]  Every week I read about some old gunsmith working on guns in their garage, or putting a rifle in their car, and the SWAT team hits them and hits them hard, and they go ahead and take the guns, go ahead and indict them for crimes that don't exist.
[00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:19.216]  Saying guns are illegal.
[00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:20.077]  You see it in the news.
[00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:22.839]  A man arrested for four guns and a thousand rounds of ammo.
[00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.120]  Dangerous arsenal.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.841]  The guns were legal, but it doesn't matter.
[00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:27.502]  He's still being charged as a terrorist.
[00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:40.728]  So the people are striking back all over the nation from Phoenix, Arizona to places in New Hampshire carrying handguns and rifles openly.
[00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.188]  It happened in Phoenix yesterday.
[00:04:42.188 --> 00:04:45.030]  It really upset the liberals.
[00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.994]  A clean-cut, sharp, well-spoken black man with an AR-15.
[00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:54.075]  It was like kryptonite to the enemy.
[00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:54.856]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.407]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:09.933]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:12.216]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:13.838]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:14.880]  There is a solution.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:23.525]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:09.915]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:06:55.605 --> 00:07:06.849]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:13.832]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:21.009]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:22.970]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.471]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:36.436]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:38.697]  It's not about left or right.
[00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:40.558]  It's about a one world government.
[00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:47.479]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:55.741]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.302]  The Obama Deception.
[00:07:57.302 --> 00:07:58.502]  The people strike back.
[00:08:01.576 --> 00:08:18.325]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.325 --> 00:08:27.691]  Okay, coming up in about an hour and 52 minutes, we've got Dr. Russell Blaylock to get into all of these mainstream news articles coming out about secret
[00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.620]  Government memos in the U.S.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:39.167]  and England about how the current flu shot is killing large numbers of people that take it.
[00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:40.407]  Killing them!
[00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:47.052]  This is official CDC telling the doctors, keep quiet about this, don't tell the public.
[00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:48.954]  Just report to us how many people died.
[00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:54.854]  And so now the doctors are brought into the criminal activity.
[00:08:54.854 --> 00:09:00.018]  But it's all done from the perspective of, oh, don't frighten the public, keep giving them their shot.
[00:09:00.018 --> 00:09:07.085]  Just let us know how many convulsions and how many deaths and how many deadly autoimmune responses.
[00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:10.648]  So that's coming up.
[00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:15.352]  We are also going to have open phones throughout the four hours today.
[00:09:16.738 --> 00:09:22.706]  Tex Mars is joining us to get into this story that first broke at townhall.com.
[00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:27.253]  Kurt Nimmo did a more detailed story titled, Voodoo in the White House.
[00:09:27.253 --> 00:09:30.037]  Now this story is witchcraft in the White House.
[00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:32.600]  The Obama White House is abuzz with talk of witchcraft.
[00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:34.397]  Yeah, it's voodoo.
[00:09:34.397 --> 00:09:37.179]  Yeah, we're going to talk about that with Tex Mars in the last hour.
[00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:08.463]  Sasha and Malia be raised with Christian influences.
[00:10:08.463 --> 00:10:12.126]  He does not want them to be involved in African voodoo.
[00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:16.309]  And secondly, he is worried about the political fallout of his enemies get wind of this.
[00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:19.691]  Reverend Wright has bad enough, but this will be political suicide.
[00:10:19.691 --> 00:10:21.652]  A close friend of Michelle Obama continued.
[00:10:21.652 --> 00:10:26.375]  We'll give you the details and where this is coming out and why this is breaking right now.
[00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.537]  Coming up with Tex Marsh in the last hour today.
[00:10:31.738 --> 00:10:38.862]  And again, brain surgeon, neurologist, Dr. Russell Blaylock joining us coming up later.
[00:10:38.862 --> 00:10:41.523]  I want to say bye to my family.
[00:10:41.523 --> 00:10:42.243]  Love you guys.
[00:10:42.243 --> 00:10:44.885]  They just dropped into the office to say hi.
[00:10:44.885 --> 00:10:45.505]  Come on back.
[00:10:45.505 --> 00:10:47.486]  I want to say bye to you guys.
[00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:47.866]  Love ya.
[00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:52.709]  I don't guess they heard me in there.
[00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:56.210]  I guess because you guys are on headphones.
[00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.191]  Love you guys.
[00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:58.792]  Bye.
[00:10:58.792 --> 00:10:59.732]  Bye.
[00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:00.132]  Love you.
[00:11:05.484 --> 00:11:12.009]  I hear my son out there laughing and giggling, but I can't see him through the broadcast window because he's too short.
[00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:13.610]  Or he's not in front of the window.
[00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.591]  Love you guys!
[00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.472]  Bye!
[00:11:17.472 --> 00:11:20.454]  Okay.
[00:11:20.454 --> 00:11:24.377]  So that is coming up with Dr. Blaylock.
[00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:27.912]  In the third hour today.
[00:11:27.912 --> 00:11:34.614]  We're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:34.614 --> 00:11:41.076]  800-259-9231 on any issue, any news item, any story you wish to discuss.
[00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.076]  But let me just run through some of what's coming up today.
[00:11:43.076 --> 00:11:54.199]  In just a moment, after I mention some of the other news and audio and video clips we're going to be playing, I'm going to just briefly, in 10-15 minutes,
[00:11:57.794 --> 00:12:10.177]  Break down all of the mainstream media coming out and having to admit that the flu shot's killing people, but then why is the government moving ahead with forced inoculation?
[00:12:10.177 --> 00:12:20.080]  And how that ties in with Governor's Association and former members of Congress and current members of Congress and former leaders of the House Dick Army?
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.200]  Republican leader?
[00:12:22.531 --> 00:12:32.606]  Former leader of the house saying they may use the flu outbreak to ram through emergency powers and the socialized health care bill, martial law.
[00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:42.158]  Not just that we're in danger of this happening, but praise God, this is now mainstream news!
[00:12:42.158 --> 00:12:51.483]  I mean, everything we're talking about 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago, 6 months ago, is now mainstream!
[00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:57.167]  And this radio show is becoming more and more mainstream, not because we're changing, we're getting more radical.
[00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:58.588]  I'm telling you really like it is now.
[00:12:59.383 --> 00:13:04.244]  Years ago, sometimes I wouldn't come out with the really hardcore info because people weren't ready for it.
[00:13:04.244 --> 00:13:09.765]  They couldn't handle it.
[00:13:09.765 --> 00:13:16.007]  But now, people are ready for the truth, and this country really is entering a revolution.
[00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:18.067]  People can feel the momentum shifting.
[00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:24.809]  It is so exciting, but there will be countervailing counterattacks from the establishment, from the empire.
[00:13:32.347 --> 00:13:37.069]  So, it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:47.853]  It's a very, very amazing time to be alive right now and to see all of this happening.
[00:13:47.853 --> 00:13:57.177]  Because there have been many times in history when more happens in a year or two than happened in the previous hundred.
[00:13:57.177 --> 00:14:01.819]  That is, in political shifts, technological development leaps forward,
[00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:30.294]  And we've seen the strong, steady march of the scientific dictatorship run by the eugenics science elite against free humanity, and it's had devastating effect, but there's an ingrained, pre-designed, pre-destined code or programming in the human psyche to resist threats to the species.
[00:14:32.222 --> 00:14:51.348]  And this elite is a threat to the species with their open-air genetic engineering, cross-species hybrids, their chimeras, the weapon systems they've developed, the fish infusion, quantum mechanics, accelerators they've developed, the cyclotrons.
[00:14:51.348 --> 00:15:01.071]  Everything they're doing at a species level and the way it's being deployed is a threat to the planet and a threat to humanity and
[00:15:04.628 --> 00:15:13.396]  All of humanity, free humanity and the tyrants that are trying to ride the tiger.
[00:15:13.396 --> 00:15:20.542]  We all have a collective Saturn booster rocket system strapped to our backs.
[00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:22.804]  We are entering, we have now entered.
[00:15:22.804 --> 00:15:29.049]  I feel like we should have a countdown here.
[00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:30.931]  We have now entered the deciding
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.186]  Set of circumstances in time that will decide the future of this species.
[00:15:39.186 --> 00:15:42.811]  We have now entered the crossroads.
[00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:44.713]  We have now entered the launch pad.
[00:15:44.713 --> 00:15:48.557]  We are now on the launch pad choosing the jump point.
[00:15:49.488 --> 00:15:51.070]  That we are going to take as a species.
[00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.794]  And the elite are trying to wrestle the controls away from the people.
[00:15:54.794 --> 00:16:03.545]  They've set up their surveillance, their technocracy, their control grid, their giant technological termination, extermination, genocide system.
[00:16:04.628 --> 00:16:09.409]  And we are literally at the control struggling with the establishment.
[00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:16.932]  Those of us that are awake and involved know that we've got to pour out our maximum effort in the days and weeks and months and years to come.
[00:16:16.932 --> 00:16:20.033]  The enemy knows they've got to pour out their maximum effort.
[00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:27.155]  There is a life-and-death struggle right now at the control panel with these people.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.362]  And that's why my life doesn't even really mean anything anymore.
[00:16:31.362 --> 00:16:34.344]  I'm not even worried about them killing me at all!
[00:16:34.344 --> 00:16:49.695]  Before I had some fear which was healthy, though I had masculine bravado or macho, but still there was a little bit of that tingle that gave me an edge.
[00:16:49.695 --> 00:16:55.679]  Now the only edge I've got is survival of the species as we hurdle in, head up against this system.
[00:16:56.874 --> 00:17:08.417]  And it's a strange feeling to laugh at the COINTELPRO, to laugh at the death threats, to laugh at the federal agents, to be able to just sit there and yell at them when they show up and not have any fear.
[00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:10.798]  Instead, you have the opposite.
[00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:20.201]  Because it just doesn't... I mean, if these men and women that serve the evil system knew any of what I know, or any of what millions of you know,
[00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:25.277]  Then they would join us immediately.
[00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.419]  There's no question about this.
[00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:40.871]  If they knew the cost, if they knew the terrain, if they knew the battlefield, if they knew who the real players were, if they knew who they're working for, there is no doubt this would end very, very quickly.
[00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:44.895]  Oh, I'm having chills right now.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.362]  Because it is horror, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:56.767]  It is horror to a degree I could have never imagined.
[00:17:56.767 --> 00:18:01.953]  It is organized, it is mechanized, it is focused death.
[00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:11.693]  And it is a fact they're putting poisons in the water by design to dumb us down and sterilize us and brain damages.
[00:18:11.693 --> 00:18:20.895]  It is a fact they're putting in the GMO food that is designed to sterilize you and cause all sorts of hormonal endocrine disruptions in the brain and the rest of the body.
[00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:28.177]  I've had top scientists on who discovered it and what they were being told at the FDA and the EPA and at top biotech companies.
[00:18:28.177 --> 00:18:31.337]  They know these are pharmacological crops you're eating.
[00:18:31.337 --> 00:18:34.058]  If you don't know what that is, go research it.
[00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:45.239]  And I look back on myself in the past caring about how I look, caring about what people say about me.
[00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:52.661]  I mean, I cared less than most, but now I don't care one bit.
[00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:55.761]  Because what does it matter in the final equation?
[00:18:55.761 --> 00:19:06.403]  Reality is so much more wild and so much more incredible and so much deeper than the limited perspective that the general public is living under.
[00:19:07.518 --> 00:19:10.019]  How do we unlock people's minds?
[00:19:10.019 --> 00:19:16.042]  Not to see what I'm seeing, not to believe what I'm saying, just to look around you and look for yourself!
[00:19:16.042 --> 00:19:19.843]  One cannot be told about the rabbit hole.
[00:19:19.843 --> 00:19:22.825]  One has to go down it themselves.
[00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:25.386]  One cannot be told about the matrix.
[00:19:25.386 --> 00:19:27.127]  One has to see it!
[00:19:27.127 --> 00:19:32.069]  And it is the world that's been pulled over your eyes to hide the truth from you.
[00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:44.162]  And it does take courage to admit the truth, but once you have the courage and look at the facts, then you realize, no, it isn't courage, it's survival.
[00:19:44.162 --> 00:19:47.984]  That evil is there whether you deny it exists or not.
[00:19:47.984 --> 00:19:49.545]  Don't you understand?
[00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:54.348]  It's real, it's true in your soul, in your heart, in your intellect.
[00:19:54.348 --> 00:19:59.492]  You know that we're living in a scientific dictatorship run by mad scientists.
[00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.757]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[00:20:03.757 --> 00:20:07.520]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.382]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[00:20:10.382 --> 00:20:13.764]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle.
[00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:15.025]  Quality above all else.
[00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:19.529]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:21.450]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.030]  We're good to go!
[00:20:42.219 --> 00:20:42.579]  I think so.
[00:21:00.438 --> 00:21:04.199]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:14.341]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:21.642]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:21:21.642 --> 00:21:27.263]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[00:21:27.263 --> 00:21:30.364]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the
[00:21:30.684 --> 00:21:36.288]  If you notice that most times there are these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[00:21:36.288 --> 00:21:43.253]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[00:21:43.253 --> 00:21:49.757]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.
[00:22:00.864 --> 00:22:04.926]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:10.828]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:10.828 --> 00:22:16.630]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.431]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984,
[00:22:22.412 --> 00:22:30.436]  And the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings, are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:36.039]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:42.682]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:22:42.682 --> 00:22:43.923]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:45.623]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:22:49.146 --> 00:22:49.747]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.747 --> 00:22:51.951]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:52.011]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.087 --> 00:23:07.130]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:13.014]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:13.014 --> 00:23:19.157]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:21.458]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.940]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:37.127]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:37.127 --> 00:23:38.808]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:40.669]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:46.893]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:55.822]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:55.822 --> 00:23:57.403]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:57.403 --> 00:23:58.585]  The people strike back.
[00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:34.038]  Somebody needs to ask the Politano, the head of Homeland Security, or the head of Health and Human Services, either one of those women, hey, what is this in the BBC and the London Telegraph and the Globe and Mail and even a few US newspapers, though it's being kept real quiet about
[00:24:35.203 --> 00:24:52.927]  Internal federal government memos about not telling the public that the swine flu shots killing people with different brain damage diseases like Guillain-Barnes.
[00:24:52.927 --> 00:24:54.827]  Now what did we tell you months ago this is going to do?
[00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:55.767]  Guillain-Barnes.
[00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:56.828]  We're on record!
[00:24:56.828 --> 00:25:01.769]  Because that's what it does, what it's designed to do.
[00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:03.429]  These are chemical lobotomies.
[00:25:06.021 --> 00:25:13.067]  They cause the brain to basically go through an autoimmune response.
[00:25:13.067 --> 00:25:14.068]  They swell up.
[00:25:14.068 --> 00:25:19.653]  I got a brain surgeon coming on in an hour and 35 minutes for you.
[00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:22.875]  He'll tell you all about it.
[00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:31.563]  And there's all these other brain diseases where people just completely become paralyzed.
[00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:32.844]  And that's what the shots did in 76.
[00:25:34.696 --> 00:25:46.745]  You can just go to YouTube and type in Swine Flu 60 Minutes and watch a 20-minute special on it with all the dead people and people in wheelchairs and paralyzed people.
[00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:51.609]  And by the way, they just do this and put it out there publicly.
[00:25:51.609 --> 00:25:56.533]  They just come out and go, yeah, Gardasil kills you and the flu shot's gonna kill you.
[00:25:56.533 --> 00:25:59.876]  And the more they say it kills you, the more moms line up to shoot their kids up.
[00:26:00.742 --> 00:26:03.545]  It's like they're under some kind of zombie control.
[00:26:03.545 --> 00:26:11.815]  It's like False of Doom and Conan the Barbarian talking to the girl up on the ledge 200 feet above saying, come to me, come to me, my child, come to me.
[00:26:11.815 --> 00:26:16.421]  And she just jumps off and bam, bounces on the concrete ground.
[00:26:19.218 --> 00:26:39.182]  And it's as if it's a sign of education, a sign of culture, a sign of the fact you're informed that if you say governments corrupt or vaccines have a dangerous history, that, oh, that's just a conspiracy theory and it's a sign of your intelligence.
[00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:41.503]  You know what?
[00:26:41.503 --> 00:26:46.444]  I absolutely, totally am going to do 30 minutes uninterrupted
[00:26:49.784 --> 00:27:02.212]  At the bottom of the next hour, before Dr. Blaylock's on with us and then text Mars, on the martial law, on the police state, on the forced inoculations, on the tyranny.
[00:27:02.212 --> 00:27:09.977]  But what I want to talk about until we get there is just all the different news, a bunch of different clips I want to play, and your phone calls.
[00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:10.858]  I'll do it that way.
[00:27:13.513 --> 00:27:30.741]  But I will tell my producers in there, at 1230, in an hour and three minutes, make sure at that point I don't take calls and that I cover all these congressmen, Governor's Association, and I know I've mentioned this, but think of the magnitude!
[00:27:30.741 --> 00:27:39.285]  They're coming out and saying word for word what I have been the lone voice saying was going to happen.
[00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:43.092]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:27:43.092 --> 00:27:46.974]  I'm telling you folks, you need to listen to what I talk about.
[00:27:46.974 --> 00:27:49.456]  I understand the enemy's operation.
[00:27:49.456 --> 00:27:58.701]  All I do is study this, and we understand who the enemy is, what makes them tick, what their program is, and how to beat them.
[00:27:58.701 --> 00:27:59.941]  We can beat these people.
[00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:00.982]  So when I tell you
[00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:12.584]  That we are already in a revolution of awakening, a peaceful revolution of info war and the establishment is going to try to make it violent.
[00:28:12.584 --> 00:28:26.731]  And I wonder why I've seen the COINTELPRO putting out massive disinfo all over even mainstream media and alternatives saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not to set me and others up if they do drop the hammer.
[00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:28.332]  Which again means I'm doing a good job.
[00:28:28.332 --> 00:28:32.234]  When I have the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL put me at the top of the list
[00:28:33.322 --> 00:28:42.792]  For no reason, when I have congressional reports attacking me, when we have this going on, it means I'm doing my job.
[00:28:42.792 --> 00:28:44.414]  And it means you're doing your job.
[00:28:44.414 --> 00:28:48.619]  All the credit on this earthly plane goes to you, the listeners.
[00:28:49.906 --> 00:29:00.714]  We've been carrying the ball down the field, we've been getting the word out, we've been spreading the word about the radio show, about the websites InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:00.714 --> 00:29:02.355]  I commend you, I salute you.
[00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:09.540]  And by the way, if they do detonate a nuke in a major city or release smallpox or release anthrax, they could throw a curveball.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.082]  Or they release some deadly flu and hype everything up.
[00:29:13.082 --> 00:29:16.345]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com aren't going to probably be online.
[00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:17.786]  We've already had them hacked and hit before.
[00:29:18.908 --> 00:29:22.131]  It'll take them a while to shut down our auxiliaries.
[00:29:22.131 --> 00:29:30.598]  Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, TheObamaDeception.net, WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[00:29:30.598 --> 00:29:36.222]  Look for the latest info on those sites if they shut the big sites down.
[00:29:36.222 --> 00:29:39.685]  Because they could pull the plug any day or they could do it in a year.
[00:29:39.685 --> 00:29:40.246]  This is real.
[00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:46.177]  We'll be right back after this quick break to take your phone calls and break down some of the other news coming up today.
[00:29:46.177 --> 00:29:51.063]  Very important transmission lined up for you.
[00:29:51.063 --> 00:29:52.445]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.445 --> 00:29:54.047]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.047 --> 00:29:57.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:04.509]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:06.511]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.511 --> 00:30:15.039]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:20.584]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.584 --> 00:30:22.206]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.426 --> 00:30:28.951]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:28.951 --> 00:30:40.000]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.460]  That's right.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.322]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:45.144]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:48.607]  That's Ecolablue.com.
[00:31:01.345 --> 00:31:10.329]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:12.971]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:14.712]  This book is for you!
[00:31:14.712 --> 00:31:20.114]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called Here's What You Do.
[00:31:20.114 --> 00:31:24.096]  You can buy it for only $6 at here'swhatyoudo.net.

[00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:31.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.183]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:31:36.183 --> 00:31:42.007]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:31:42.007 --> 00:31:45.649]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:48.371]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:53.414]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:31:53.414 --> 00:31:53.675]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:31:53.675 --> 00:31:55.076]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.581]  It is a big idea.
[00:32:02.581 --> 00:32:05.403]  A New World Order.
[00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:10.307]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:32:10.307 --> 00:32:13.129]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:32:13.129 --> 00:32:15.911]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:19.093]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:32:19.093 --> 00:32:25.218]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:32:25.218 --> 00:32:26.419]  This can't be happening!
[00:32:29.437 --> 00:32:34.881]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:32:34.881 --> 00:32:38.763]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:32:38.763 --> 00:32:41.325]  Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[00:32:41.325 --> 00:32:42.486]  Most people have no idea.
[00:32:42.486 --> 00:32:43.266]  They're not after money.
[00:32:43.266 --> 00:32:44.547]  They have all the money they need.
[00:32:44.547 --> 00:32:45.528]  They're after power.
[00:32:45.528 --> 00:32:46.689]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:32:46.689 --> 00:32:51.432]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:32:58.196 --> 00:32:59.277]  You have been warned.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:32:59.505]  Yeah.
[00:33:34.392 --> 00:33:42.474]  We're going to go live with Dr. Russell Blaylock in the third and fourth hour today at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:42.474 --> 00:33:52.377]  Obviously we're live right now on the radio on this 18th day of August on this Tuesday edition.
[00:33:52.377 --> 00:33:54.037]  All right, your phone calls Daniel
[00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:59.576]  Sati, Andrew, Cindy, Bob, and others.
[00:33:59.576 --> 00:34:00.576]  We're going to go to your calls.
[00:34:00.576 --> 00:34:03.118]  Let me just mention some of the news here.
[00:34:03.118 --> 00:34:06.060]  I want to play an audio clip.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.725]  Exercising My Rights, Man Explains Why He Carried Rifle Near Obama Event.
[00:34:12.725 --> 00:34:16.068]  I may actually just go live next hour so we can play the actual video of that.
[00:34:17.893 --> 00:34:43.210]  And he just really lays it out so well when they run over freaking out going he's got a he's got an AK-47 this this this domesticated woman this slave of government she sees police and black mask and feels safe but she's a citizen with a gun and gets really afraid she says that makes me uncomfortable and he said well lady wasn't too many years ago that seeing a black man made people uncomfortable they wouldn't have their kids around a black man because the lady had her kids with her
[00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:46.352]  And, well, that shut her up real quick.
[00:34:46.352 --> 00:34:47.353]  And that's the whole point.
[00:34:47.353 --> 00:34:49.654]  We have to exercise our rights or lose them.
[00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:57.519]  I mean, they've got us now where they're SWAT teaming us in our houses every day and in the South and the West, even.
[00:34:57.519 --> 00:34:59.901]  Because a neighbor calls in and says, I saw a gun.
[00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:01.381]  The cops don't care if it's legal.
[00:35:01.381 --> 00:35:02.462]  They still come.
[00:35:02.462 --> 00:35:03.102]  It's crazy.
[00:35:03.102 --> 00:35:05.924]  They say, well, we were spawned because neighbors were concerned.
[00:35:05.924 --> 00:35:10.147]  And they come in Dallas, Texas and knock on the door and say, hi, this is Knock and Talk.
[00:35:10.147 --> 00:35:11.708]  We're here to discuss your firearms.
[00:35:13.843 --> 00:35:15.043]  Well, my husband's not here.
[00:35:15.043 --> 00:35:18.985]  Let us in the house to look at him.
[00:35:18.985 --> 00:35:24.226]  So, it will shut down their anti-gun crusade if we start exercising it openly.
[00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:30.768]  That's why they put up billboards saying, report illegal guns, and they show the image of a handgun.
[00:35:30.768 --> 00:35:34.789]  Those are all over Texas since I was in high school.
[00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:37.610]  We're talking 18 years or longer.
[00:35:38.939 --> 00:35:45.060]  That I've been seeing those, and I'll be in other parts of the country, California, Florida, I see them.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:36:02.105]  An image of a revolver, and it says report illegal guns, and then the idiot carpet cleaner, the moron meter reader, the moron neighbor will see you putting your deer rifle in the back of your car, and they call the cops on you, and they come!
[00:36:02.105 --> 00:36:07.806]  I had the cops called on me once when I lived in an apartment, putting my deer rifle in the back of my Mustang hatchback to go hunting,
[00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:12.300]  And later my neighbor told me the cops showed up and were asking questions.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:18.564]  That's the America I live in, where they're teaching us our guns are taboo and dirty and bad.
[00:36:18.564 --> 00:36:24.407]  But there are cameras and checkpoints and SWAT teams and regular Army on the streets and Marine Corps on the streets.
[00:36:24.407 --> 00:36:29.169]  That's normal and regular Army searching people at the Kentucky Derby and the Super Bowl.
[00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:30.950]  That's normal!
[00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.791]  But an old man
[00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:36.890]  Who dies of a heart attack on Inside the LAPD on Discovery Channel.
[00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.254]  They come in and make fun of his dead rotten body, dead for a week on the ground in his house.
[00:36:41.254 --> 00:36:47.920]  And then the cops openly steal his guns on Inside the LAPD and say, I'm gonna keep this one, I'm gonna keep that one.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:53.165]  They're so criminal, they think it's normal to steal the guy's guns on TV.
[00:36:53.165 --> 00:36:59.671]  Just like we had cops in New York with Lee Archange walking up to Luke Hradowski and others and say, on video, in the film Truth Rising,
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.842]  And they say, we're going to say your backpack's a bomb.
[00:37:02.842 --> 00:37:06.125]  We know it isn't a bomb, we're going to say it, 30 days in the hole.
[00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:06.965]  On camera!
[00:37:06.965 --> 00:37:10.068]  They didn't even carry a video of it!
[00:37:10.068 --> 00:37:17.394]  And then the uniformed cops show up, grab his camera and say, this is a gun, this backpack is a bomb.
[00:37:17.394 --> 00:37:22.438]  Leave, or we're going to charge you with having a gun, and then laugh like gangsters.
[00:37:22.438 --> 00:37:23.099]  Because they are.
[00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:26.101]  Well, guess what, big gangster man?
[00:37:26.101 --> 00:37:36.231]  You got real gangsters running things, eugenicist gangsters, scientific little eggheads who get off on the power trip that while you think you're big and macho, you think when you...
[00:37:38.012 --> 00:37:46.439]  You know, act tough and swagger through the university door or something while you're working on air conditioners and some little professor scurries out of your way and you feel powerful?
[00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:49.081]  That little egghead's part of a eugenicist cult!
[00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:51.363]  That little egghead's putting poison in your water!
[00:37:51.363 --> 00:37:54.906]  That little egghead's a lot more vicious than you are, big man!
[00:37:54.906 --> 00:38:03.934]  That little egghead with the veins at his temples and his tiny chicken neck is a psychopathic, control-freak killer!
[00:38:03.934 --> 00:38:05.275]  And he's running game on ya!
[00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:11.443]  Grow up!
[00:38:11.443 --> 00:38:13.123]  Alright, I said I'm going to cover the news.
[00:38:13.123 --> 00:38:16.765]  That's one article and I've gone down a five minute rant.
[00:38:16.765 --> 00:38:20.607]  Government will hide flu, swine flu outbreak to save Obamacare.
[00:38:20.607 --> 00:38:21.948]  I just can't get over these headlines.
[00:38:21.948 --> 00:38:25.630]  Polio vaccine filled with live polio kills people.
[00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.051]  AP.
[00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:30.252]  Live cancer viruses, German news.
[00:38:30.252 --> 00:38:31.013]  Again, that's coming up.
[00:38:31.874 --> 00:38:33.375]  I just can't get over these headlines.
[00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:39.917]  Governors write letter to the Department of Defense saying that it's a violation of state's rights to put regular troops on the streets.
[00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:42.038]  But here's the new news.
[00:38:42.038 --> 00:38:44.919]  Man carries assault rifle to Obama protest.
[00:38:44.919 --> 00:38:45.879]  And it's legal!
[00:38:45.879 --> 00:38:50.261]  CNN!
[00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:57.804]  On the socialized healthcare front, thousands of surgeries may be cut in Metro Vancouver, leaked paper reveals.
[00:38:57.804 --> 00:38:58.944]  Part of the socialized healthcare.
[00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:04.236]  I mean, you might wait two, three years in Australia and England for a surgery you need.
[00:39:04.236 --> 00:39:06.317]  This is what the idiot public is asking for?
[00:39:06.317 --> 00:39:08.378]  Of course, they're not really.
[00:39:08.378 --> 00:39:08.939]  What is it now?
[00:39:08.939 --> 00:39:20.706]  About 25% are morons and want the free health care, or even if you get paid minimum wage, they're going to take an additional 15 to 25% out of your check, and they're just going to steal your money.
[00:39:20.706 --> 00:39:22.607]  It all goes to offshore banks.
[00:39:22.607 --> 00:39:24.389]  That's why they want this new tax.
[00:39:24.389 --> 00:39:26.330]  You're not going to get any health care, stupid!
[00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:30.799]  Here's another one out of England.
[00:39:30.799 --> 00:39:37.661]  Woman gives birth on payment after being refused ambulance under government health care.
[00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:47.164]  The White House is now saying they're going to stop asking their supporters to spy on their neighbors and report anything quote fishy to the fishy box at whitehouse.gov.
[00:39:48.632 --> 00:39:50.053]  The flag box.
[00:39:50.053 --> 00:39:52.094]  Flag at WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:39:52.094 --> 00:39:53.094]  Fishy.
[00:39:53.094 --> 00:39:54.595]  Watch your neighbors.
[00:39:54.595 --> 00:39:55.796]  Fishy.
[00:39:55.796 --> 00:39:57.237]  Go to town halls.
[00:39:57.237 --> 00:39:59.978]  Beat people up that don't support the Obamacare.
[00:39:59.978 --> 00:40:06.061]  Hey, have you noticed that just three weeks ago they got on air and said, it's all staged.
[00:40:06.061 --> 00:40:12.385]  Republican lobbyists are busing people in to say no to socialized health care and government eugenics health care.
[00:40:12.385 --> 00:40:14.086]  They dropped that a couple weeks ago.
[00:40:14.086 --> 00:40:16.747]  Now they're dropping the whole thing, begging and pleading.
[00:40:19.491 --> 00:40:21.373]  Blue Dog Democrat, as they're called.
[00:40:21.373 --> 00:40:24.415]  In fact, I forgot to print that, just search engine it.
[00:40:24.415 --> 00:40:28.038]  Blue Dog Democrat says, start over on healthcare.
[00:40:28.038 --> 00:40:29.480]  I think it's the headline, I think it's Politico.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.443]  The point is, I read it this morning, with the Democrats going, listen, start over!
[00:40:33.443 --> 00:40:36.266]  Try it again in a few months, rename it!
[00:40:36.266 --> 00:40:39.428]  Don't worry, we're gonna get these people's money for the offshore banks.
[00:40:39.428 --> 00:40:44.413]  Don't worry, you're gonna get your couple mil a year, you know, each politician, and pay off money to the Swiss accounts.
[00:40:44.926 --> 00:40:46.806]  But first, we just gotta back off.
[00:40:46.806 --> 00:40:49.207]  Look, you got the slaves rattled.
[00:40:49.207 --> 00:40:51.648]  Don't worry, we're parasites, we're hyenas.
[00:40:51.648 --> 00:40:54.228]  We're gonna pull these gazelles down and eat them later.
[00:40:54.228 --> 00:41:09.312]  But they're right now, you know, running hightail from us, and so let's stop chasing them for now and then catch up with them later.
[00:41:09.312 --> 00:41:10.212]  So that's going on.
[00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.482]  Also, record numbers of British and U.S.
[00:41:14.482 --> 00:41:19.363]  troops being killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan now in the border region.
[00:41:19.363 --> 00:41:32.327]  President Obama urged more than 5,000 veterans gathered here to brace for a daunting and perhaps bloody period ahead in Afghanistan, but told them he believes the war is fundamental to the defense of our people.
[00:41:32.327 --> 00:41:33.027]  An opium war.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.561]  First it was a doubling and then tripling and then quadrupling and then eight times.
[00:41:38.561 --> 00:41:49.925]  Now the State Department admits there's 12 times the opium, 12 times the opium flowing out of Afghanistan to the Western world.
[00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:52.326]  12 times!
[00:41:52.326 --> 00:41:58.567]  More than double the previous record from the 1980s, late 1980s.
[00:41:58.567 --> 00:41:59.748]  12 times!
[00:41:59.748 --> 00:42:03.289]  What do you think the Russians wanted Afghanistan because they like desert mountains?
[00:42:04.497 --> 00:42:06.418]  You think they liked it because they like getting shot at?
[00:42:06.418 --> 00:42:07.899]  They wanted the opium.
[00:42:07.899 --> 00:42:09.360]  All these big governments deal drugs.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:18.966]  Because they get to control criminal syndicates worldwide and launder the money and leverage it through fractional reserve banking and derivatives, a thousand to one.
[00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.013]  You think you're over there to help the Afghan children?
[00:42:26.013 --> 00:42:27.154]  Man, that's funny.
[00:42:27.154 --> 00:42:33.217]  Just like Iraq, they didn't want a secular government over there with colleges and 60% of the college grads being women.
[00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:37.200]  So they went over there and blew the hell out of it and put the Muslim extremists in.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.101]  Operation Victorious.
[00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:43.164]  Because radical Islam is the sword of the new world order.
[00:42:43.164 --> 00:42:44.144]  It's a fact.
[00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:44.965]  Declassified.
[00:42:46.906 --> 00:42:56.154]  And if a country tries to give their people industrialization, oh, the Muslim extremists overthrow your country and then play the part of the pretext for the U.S.
[00:42:56.154 --> 00:42:56.974]  forces to come in.
[00:42:56.974 --> 00:43:00.317]  It's a very, very sick, sick, sick system.
[00:43:00.317 --> 00:43:07.243]  Of course, Pat Tillman, the big football star, found out about that, so they killed him.
[00:43:07.243 --> 00:43:09.745]  And they killed him real good.
[00:43:09.745 --> 00:43:10.826]  You're not about to cut in.
[00:43:13.067 --> 00:43:17.611]  To 500 billion dollars a smack a year.
[00:43:17.611 --> 00:43:22.435]  Trillions in smack money.
[00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:26.619]  Trillions they get to leverage.
[00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:28.060]  Trillions the bankers get.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:28.801]  You understand?
[00:43:31.072 --> 00:43:51.961]  And again, I almost ran off the road a month ago as I was listening to XM, BBC, and they reported what I already knew, but to hear it out of their mouths and to have them report it like it was no big deal, like they were talking about the price of pork belly futures or something, you know, the price of bacon.
[00:43:51.961 --> 00:43:57.923]  They were just reporting on it very nonchalantly as if it was good, calling evil good and good evil.
[00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:02.922]  I think?
[00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.350]  They go on and they say, well, the U.S.
[00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.151]  and British forces, U.S.
[00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:29.252]  and British forces guard the poppy opium fields.
[00:44:29.252 --> 00:44:33.573]  Because if they don't, the Taliban will come in and get a stronghold.
[00:44:33.573 --> 00:44:40.274]  But by growing and helping deliver the poppies to market, coalition forces keep the Taliban from getting a stronghold.
[00:44:40.274 --> 00:44:47.556]  By supporting these farmers in their meager way of life, they have a future and they're helping build a freedom in Afghanistan.
[00:44:48.951 --> 00:44:52.633]  Of course, the truth is the Taliban and Al Qaeda are there to guard the poppy fields.
[00:44:52.633 --> 00:44:56.455]  The regions, six, seven different tribes control it.
[00:44:56.455 --> 00:44:57.896]  They grow it.
[00:44:57.896 --> 00:44:58.476]  The U.S.
[00:44:58.476 --> 00:45:02.439]  and British guard it and ship it to market and pay them.
[00:45:02.439 --> 00:45:03.539]  And that's why they're there.
[00:45:03.539 --> 00:45:13.385]  But they spun it as if the Taliban has been kicked out now and, oh, they're there growing the poppies because if they don't grow the poppies, the military guards the poppies.
[00:45:14.022 --> 00:45:20.265]  And then they'll occasionally go eradicate a couple fields of some warlord that hasn't paid their cut.
[00:45:20.265 --> 00:45:24.666]  You know, they'll have a few predetermined show events.
[00:45:24.666 --> 00:45:31.549]  But then the cops will SWAT team you, they will search you, they will make you take your shoes off at airports, they will check you getting on trains and buses.
[00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:34.831]  Oh my gosh, you were found with one balloon of heroin.
[00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:36.551]  Oh my gosh, you're such a criminal.
[00:45:36.551 --> 00:45:38.592]  Meanwhile, they're shipping it in!
[00:45:38.592 --> 00:45:39.933]  But of course, they've got to do that.
[00:45:39.933 --> 00:45:42.874]  They've got to make it illegal or it doesn't have that black market price.
[00:45:45.831 --> 00:45:54.233]  And then these people wouldn't need to rob your car in stereo or sell their bodies, feeding off the good public as a tax.
[00:45:54.233 --> 00:45:59.355]  The drug trade is a government tax, an illegal government tax.
[00:45:59.355 --> 00:46:08.917]  And they have zombies of crackheads and heroin heads and drug addicts out robbing, stealing, kiting checks, everything else to get the money.
[00:46:08.917 --> 00:46:11.858]  So I'll tell everybody again, do not ever,
[00:46:12.765 --> 00:46:18.669]  Tell your children, it's not, don't use drugs because you're not old enough, or it's cool, or, you know, the... No, explain it.
[00:46:18.669 --> 00:46:21.171]  It's dirty, it's bad, it's slavery.
[00:46:21.171 --> 00:46:24.913]  It's chemical slavery.
[00:46:24.913 --> 00:46:28.015]  Don't ever use any of their filth.
[00:46:28.015 --> 00:46:28.575]  None of it!
[00:46:28.575 --> 00:46:33.619]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[00:46:34.895 --> 00:46:38.538]  Just Obama-warned soldiers, coming days in Afghanistan will be bloody.
[00:46:38.538 --> 00:46:41.500]  And now there's troops all down in Colombia and surrounding areas, U.S.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.422]  troops, all about the drugs.
[00:46:44.422 --> 00:46:50.166]  And CIA aircraft constantly crash full of pure cocaine and heroin, and it's just brushed under the rug in the news.
[00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:58.132]  I mean, there are so many flights that every few months one of their aircraft crashes.
[00:46:58.132 --> 00:47:02.455]  Our local police pull over a truck full of heroin, the local cop doesn't listen when they flash
[00:47:03.547 --> 00:47:08.370]  Department of Defense or State Department badges, so they kill the cop and they gotta cover that up.
[00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:14.114]  I mean, they're just constantly doing whatever they want.
[00:47:14.114 --> 00:47:16.196]  It's all such a sick joke.
[00:47:16.196 --> 00:47:18.798]  I mean, it is such a sick joke.
[00:47:18.798 --> 00:47:27.184]  And they admit they're dealing the drugs on international British radio?
[00:47:27.184 --> 00:47:30.306]  I mean, how sick is that?
[00:47:31.698 --> 00:47:34.179]  And you can tell a cop that at a checkpoint, he'll say, GOOD!
[00:47:34.179 --> 00:47:38.461]  GET OUT OF TASER AND YOU SLAVE!
[00:47:38.461 --> 00:47:39.301]  I'm sick of it!
[00:47:39.301 --> 00:47:41.982]  Alright, let's talk to Daniel in Jersey.
[00:47:41.982 --> 00:47:43.043]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[00:47:43.043 --> 00:47:44.203]  Go ahead.
[00:47:44.203 --> 00:47:45.464]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:45.464 --> 00:47:51.546]  I think I know the big surprise move that Obama's going to pull out of his hat in September.
[00:47:51.546 --> 00:47:58.469]  I'm expecting that he's going to amaze the world by succeeding where everyone else has failed by successfully
[00:47:59.065 --> 00:48:04.849]  Mediating the prophetic peace contract between modern-day Israel and the Arab-Islamic world.
[00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:18.499]  And when he does that, his popularity will soar, his horrible legislative programs will sail through Congress, and we'll know it's fulfillment of Bible prophecy if this contract has the four provisions that the Bible says the contract is going to have.
[00:48:18.499 --> 00:48:25.684]  Yeah, I don't see that happening with Benjamin Netanyahu, and every time there's a peace deal,
[00:48:27.074 --> 00:48:34.259]  Every time they've had hundreds of them, people think it's the sign of certain interpretations of revelations.
[00:48:34.259 --> 00:48:36.280]  I'm not saying the world isn't crazy.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:45.367]  I'm not saying there isn't Mark of the Beast biometrics and chips going in and total surveillance and that anything is possible.
[00:48:45.367 --> 00:48:45.887]  But you know what?
[00:48:45.887 --> 00:48:48.389]  We're going to certainly find out, aren't we?
[00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:53.753]  Yes, and I think that's the kind of move we're going to have and not something like a big 9-11 terrorist event.
[00:48:56.055 --> 00:48:59.117]  He's rising to power peacefully and prosperously.
[00:48:59.117 --> 00:49:03.259]  And, you know, the Bible tells us that this, uh, it's got the four terms of that.
[00:49:03.259 --> 00:49:11.944]  Israel, uh, well, the Arab-Islamic world will, uh, agree for the first time that Israel's got a right to exist there as a nation.
[00:49:11.944 --> 00:49:14.205]  It'll create the Palestinian state.
[00:49:14.205 --> 00:49:18.507]  It'll place Jerusalem under international United Nations control.
[00:49:18.507 --> 00:49:23.610]  And finally, we'll allow the rebuilding of the inner court of King Solomon's Temple 150 yards north
[00:49:25.402 --> 00:49:28.804]  of the Dome of the Rock at the site of the Little Gazebo, the Dome of the Wilson area.
[00:49:28.804 --> 00:49:33.766]  Yeah, it is interesting that all these deals do mirror what's in the Bible, isn't it?
[00:49:33.766 --> 00:49:47.372]  Well, you know, if whoever the person is, if not Obama, someone else, whoever does pull this success in mediating this peace contract, we all know he's the Antichristos, the man who's coming pretending to be the Messiah.
[00:49:47.372 --> 00:49:50.333]  The Arabs will think he's the Mahdi who's come out of the well.
[00:49:50.333 --> 00:49:54.015]  The Jews will think he's the Messiah they've been waiting for.
[00:49:54.625 --> 00:50:03.520]  The Hindus will think he's the 300th reincarnation of Buddha, and many Christians who are poorly schooled in Bible prophecy will think he's Jesus Christ's return.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.225]  And that's how we're going to succeed in getting this peace contract through.
[00:50:06.496 --> 00:50:28.268]  Well, the issue is my Bible doesn't have the pre-Rapture in it, so what's going to happen when Christians aren't taken out of this and they've been taught Romans 13, the clergy response teams worshipping government as the new gospel, all the disciples knelt before government, did whatever it said, basically Heil Hitler, that was his favorite quote was Romans 13.
[00:50:28.268 --> 00:50:34.632]  They're going to follow whatever they're told by this world government religious leader because their churches are telling them it's of God.
[00:50:39.326 --> 00:50:39.886]  Okay, Alex.
[00:50:39.886 --> 00:50:40.567]  Thanks.
[00:50:40.567 --> 00:50:42.327]  Hey, interesting points, Daniel.
[00:50:42.327 --> 00:50:43.008]  Thank you.
[00:50:43.008 --> 00:50:45.029]  Satie, Andrew, Cindy, Bob.
[00:50:45.029 --> 00:50:48.630]  I'm going to blitz through calls and then end all the news.
[00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.311]  Stay with us.
[00:50:50.311 --> 00:50:51.792]  The revolution is upon us.
[00:50:51.792 --> 00:50:57.294]  There's certainly a huge awakening happening that's even bigger than I thought it would be.
[00:50:57.294 --> 00:50:58.895]  It's happening faster than I thought it would.
[00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:07.869]  If you'd like to replace the ineffective and toxic cleaning products under your sink, you need to visit BioGreenClean.com.
[00:51:07.869 --> 00:51:15.213]  BioGreenClean is the first heavy-duty all-natural multi-purpose cleaner that outperforms every other competitive cleaning product on the market today.
[00:51:15.213 --> 00:51:23.898]  BioGreenClean is tough enough to take on the kitchen, the bathroom, your outdoor grill, and virtually anything in your car, home, boat, or office, yet is safe enough for your children and pets.
[00:51:23.898 --> 00:51:26.780]  BioGreenClean does not contain harmful chemical solvents.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.561]  We're good to go.
[00:51:50.384 --> 00:51:50.484]  877-572-6516.
[00:51:50.484 --> 00:51:50.985]  That's 877-572-6516.
[00:51:50.985 --> 00:51:51.767]  Bio Green Clean.
[00:51:51.767 --> 00:51:53.110]  It works hard so you don't have to.
[00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:53.571]  Try it today!
[00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:07.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:14.788]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:52:14.788 --> 00:52:20.935]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.355 --> 00:52:23.336]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.336 --> 00:52:25.836]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.836 --> 00:52:37.400]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.080]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.941]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:47.163]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.825 --> 00:52:56.117]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.117 --> 00:52:57.699]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.699 --> 00:52:58.881]  The people strike back!
[00:53:00.882 --> 00:53:08.108]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:53:08.108 --> 00:53:12.052]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:53:12.052 --> 00:53:20.379]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:53:20.379 --> 00:53:23.022]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:53:23.302 --> 00:53:23.742]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.315 --> 00:53:47.736]  We're good.
[00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:28.958]  Okay, we're going to go to Satie, Andrew, Cindy, Bob, Keith, and others.
[00:54:28.958 --> 00:54:30.219]  I'll put the challenge out.
[00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:38.224]  You know, we extended the contest a few more days for people to get their entries in for the Obama Joker contest.
[00:54:40.906 --> 00:54:51.570]  And right now it looks like San Francisco, the video entry we've got posted by itself, we've got some pages with a whole bunch of entries posted together.
[00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:56.492]  The best one I've seen, I'm the judge, is the San Francisco Joker.
[00:54:59.025 --> 00:55:28.167]  Contest entry where they put up hundreds and hundreds and hundreds big ones little ones all over everything and did it really boldly I mean they did it over and over again with police five ten feet away behind them sneaking up I mean I didn't tell people do that I should do it in legal lawful areas but boldness of this level they're gonna win just for the artistic level of skill and the great camera work they did in fact I want to
[00:55:29.571 --> 00:55:31.392]  They're going to definitely win second place.
[00:55:31.392 --> 00:55:33.132]  There's still a bunch of entries I've got to look at.
[00:55:33.132 --> 00:55:35.393]  There may be something that outdoes it.
[00:55:35.393 --> 00:55:36.214]  We'll see.
[00:55:36.214 --> 00:55:49.939]  But I've been spending an hour or so a day just trying to watch these and I'm so busy with other things that... And I've got to jet out of town tomorrow just for 24 hours.
[00:55:49.939 --> 00:55:56.622]  So I'm... I'm working on everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:56.622 --> 00:55:56.782]  But...
[00:55:58.404 --> 00:55:59.525]  It's all very, very exciting.
[00:55:59.525 --> 00:56:02.108]  Let's go ahead and talk to Satie in Chicago.
[00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:03.470]  You're on the air.
[00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.693]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[00:56:05.693 --> 00:56:06.554]  Talking to you, my friend.
[00:56:07.341 --> 00:56:10.964]  Hey, listen, man, I want to say one thing to you and your staff.
[00:56:10.964 --> 00:56:15.107]  You guys are doing absolutely magnificent work, and you're waking up a lot of people.
[00:56:15.107 --> 00:56:20.452]  I mean, you get on and yell and you get frustrated, but a lot of people are waking up because of you.
[00:56:20.452 --> 00:56:22.233]  I've woken up because of you.
[00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:25.215]  And you gave somebody else on the air some advice.
[00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.297]  I don't know if they took it, but I certainly did.
[00:56:27.297 --> 00:56:33.142]  I'm putting together a public access television show at the television station here in Chicago.
[00:56:33.715 --> 00:56:42.883]  Uh, called the Hidden News Hour, which is a key word, where we're going to be reporting on news events, or world events, that aren't appearing in the news, magically.
[00:56:42.883 --> 00:56:47.027]  And, uh, so it's been a couple of months away, because I've got to take a whole slew of classes.
[00:56:47.027 --> 00:56:49.509]  I've only taken one of them so far.
[00:56:49.509 --> 00:56:51.251]  But, uh, it's going to happen.
[00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:59.238]  Um, the reason why I want to call, bro, is that, uh, there's a, you know, of course you know, they're smearing you all over the place, and it's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:56:59.238 --> 00:57:00.199]  So, all sorts of
[00:57:00.669 --> 00:57:09.106]  Preposterous accusations, but the one that really surprised me the most, and you might know about it, but I called just in case you didn't.
[00:57:09.106 --> 00:57:10.830]  I came across this thing last night.
[00:57:11.314 --> 00:57:29.978]  Well, they actually are saying that you are a secret operative of Israel and your job is to distract the world and get them to blame the Americans and the Europeans to take the distraction off the Jews who really are the evil ones.
[00:57:29.978 --> 00:57:34.939]  And then they said their only evidence was, hey, did you know he's married to a Jew?
[00:57:34.939 --> 00:57:38.480]  And then they had a picture here of your wife and you clicked something.
[00:57:38.931 --> 00:57:43.115]  I didn't even click it, but apparently you click it and get all this information.
[00:57:43.115 --> 00:57:44.476]  They're smearing your wife, too.
[00:57:44.476 --> 00:57:46.298]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:57:46.298 --> 00:57:55.566]  I hear you, and I'm going to let you go only because I don't talk about all the attacks on me here on air because people don't tune in for that.
[00:57:55.566 --> 00:58:04.435]  I mean, if people want to go read the articles I'm reading about how it's causing brain damage to take and killing people to take the flu vaccine, the current one,
[00:58:05.723 --> 00:58:09.289]  Or how the governors are saying we don't want troops on the street.
[00:58:09.289 --> 00:58:14.137]  I'm being smeared by foundation-funded groups, probably out of Israel.
[00:58:14.137 --> 00:58:14.938]  That's how it works.
[00:58:14.938 --> 00:58:19.726]  The Israeli lobby hits you with the anti-Semitism because they know how popular it is.
[00:58:20.703 --> 00:58:32.728]  And all of this stuff started because me talking about how I have Native American background and my wife from family she had from Poland in relatives does have some Jewish background.
[00:58:32.728 --> 00:58:36.530]  She's a Christian, her family are Texas farmers, and they're all Christians.
[00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:37.570]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:38.871]  That comes from my show.
[00:58:38.871 --> 00:58:39.411]  That's from me.
[00:58:40.971 --> 00:58:46.616]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.616 --> 00:58:50.340]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.721]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.721 --> 00:58:53.723]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:58:53.723 --> 00:58:54.704]  Well, you should.
[00:58:54.704 --> 00:58:59.188]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:58:59.188 --> 00:58:59.649]  That's right.

[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.901]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.901 --> 01:00:05.127]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.127 --> 01:00:06.427]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.427 --> 01:00:07.408]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:09.925]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.925 --> 01:00:11.526]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.526 --> 01:00:12.466]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.466 --> 01:00:17.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.288 --> 01:00:25.652]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.652 --> 01:00:36.617]  Yeah, to finish up the last guy's question, Satie, the strangest thing is we've tracked back the claims that I work for Israel from the Israeli lobby.
[01:00:38.737 --> 01:00:44.838]  We've also tracked the disinfo that I'm some type of Jesuit agent, and I'm not even Catholic.
[01:00:44.838 --> 01:00:50.680]  My whole family's Protestant, to the Israeli lobby.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.860]  So, very bizarre.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.121]  And the Israeli lobby is very active inside the United States.
[01:00:57.121 --> 01:01:01.342]  They know how whacked out the internet is, and they do that kind of stuff.
[01:01:01.342 --> 01:01:04.443]  The issue is the information I cover here.
[01:01:05.555 --> 01:01:08.498]  What are you going to do with the information I cover?
[01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:19.548]  I'm here talking about how the public's waking up, how we're getting involved, how we're having victories against tyranny, how the flu shot's killing people, how they're putting poison in the water, how they're eugenicists.
[01:01:19.548 --> 01:01:21.790]  I'm giving you their own documents, chapter and verse.
[01:01:23.163 --> 01:01:27.666]  I'm telling the people to get out and active and vocal so they can see their own power.
[01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:29.587]  That's what the Joker poster was about.
[01:01:29.587 --> 01:01:34.950]  Then the establishment cracks down on it, tries to intimidate people not to do it.
[01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:37.552]  Then it only blows up bigger in their face.
[01:01:37.552 --> 01:01:38.613]  I mean, this is exciting!
[01:01:40.345 --> 01:01:48.550]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to have the establishment... This is what the FBI said they did back in the 60s and 70s under Operation Chaos.
[01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:54.793]  How would they break up the anti-war groups, or pro-gun groups, or conservative groups, or land rights groups, or Black Panthers?
[01:01:54.793 --> 01:02:03.278]  They would come in with agents and sow seeds of dissension, and they'd say, the leader of your Chicago branch, or your Detroit branch, he's stealing the money.
[01:02:03.278 --> 01:02:08.040]  Or, he's really working for the man.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.341]  Or, he's doing this or that.
[01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:12.343]  You're going to know who's working for the man.
[01:02:12.343 --> 01:02:13.844]  They're going to be calling for violence.
[01:02:13.844 --> 01:02:17.487]  I could take one look at Hal Turner and tell you he was a Fed.
[01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:19.569]  Calling for killing this person, kill that person.
[01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:24.453]  It's now come out in federal court that he is a federal informant setting people up.
[01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:27.335]  Associated Press, he said that in court.
[01:02:27.335 --> 01:02:31.359]  It's admitted.
[01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:38.505]  When the Feds come out and pose as patriots, they try to create dissension, they try to create racism, they try to
[01:02:40.103 --> 01:02:44.966]  Black racists, white racists, Hispanic racists, they try to create division.
[01:02:44.966 --> 01:02:46.868]  They tell you you don't have power.
[01:02:46.868 --> 01:02:48.949]  They say everybody's a fed.
[01:02:48.949 --> 01:02:55.934]  That everybody should hide and not get involved and that you better creep around and you better not stick your head up or you're gonna get it.
[01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:58.556]  And they talk about red and blue list all day.
[01:02:58.556 --> 01:03:05.500]  Trying to intimidate you, trying to make you scared, trying to make you shut up and stand down.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.002]  Okay?
[01:03:07.002 --> 01:03:07.462]  Period.
[01:03:08.573 --> 01:03:09.654]  That's how it works.
[01:03:09.654 --> 01:03:10.535]  That's how it happens.
[01:03:10.535 --> 01:03:19.682]  I mean, the people that say, because it's easy, it's mindless, it's simple to say Alex Jones works for the Vatican because he's had guests on who happen to be Catholic.
[01:03:19.682 --> 01:03:23.566]  And they'll create a big list of every guest I've ever had on and if they're Catholic or not.
[01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:24.847]  I don't think Catholics are bad people.
[01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:26.108]  I think they're good pro-life people.
[01:03:27.324 --> 01:03:28.605]  So, I mean, here, let me just say it.
[01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:31.467]  I'm Jewish and I'm Catholic.
[01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:33.749]  And I also say I'm a Reptoid.
[01:03:33.749 --> 01:03:34.669]  I'm a Reptoid.
[01:03:34.669 --> 01:03:35.109]  Fine.
[01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.650]  I'm bad.
[01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.811]  Okay, whatever.
[01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:42.875]  The point is, is that regardless, we now have to face the issues.
[01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:46.497]  Regardless, we now have to move forward.
[01:03:46.497 --> 01:03:49.439]  And, you know, I'm really sad to say a lot of this isn't COINTELPRO either.
[01:03:49.439 --> 01:03:55.704]  It's just jealous, angry people who are jealous at anybody's success and who are in this anti-New World Order movement.
[01:03:57.099 --> 01:04:02.181]  To be stars, or to be studs, or to be celebrities.
[01:04:02.181 --> 01:04:06.242]  And they're not successful because they're in this for the wrong reason.
[01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.643]  And so they divide people along those lines.
[01:04:08.643 --> 01:04:11.224]  I'm here trying to work with everybody.
[01:04:11.224 --> 01:04:18.707]  And I've had incredible lies told about me, my family, just any lie you can imagine, it's been told.
[01:04:18.707 --> 01:04:21.908]  And it's all lies, so I'm not really worried about it.
[01:04:23.365 --> 01:04:28.708]  I'm more worried about the souls and the minds and the psyches of the people that believe their own baloney.
[01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.229]  Okay?
[01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:32.710]  So, it's just that simple.
[01:04:34.582 --> 01:04:43.167]  I mean, whenever I do criticize Israel, the anti-Semites are so mentally ill, they post the videos and say, this was a secret radio show Alex did.
[01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:44.868]  He didn't know anybody was hearing it.
[01:04:44.868 --> 01:04:48.130]  They'll probably take what I just said earlier and say, this was secret.
[01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:49.531]  He didn't know it was on the air.
[01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:56.596]  You know, because they, they can't have me criticize Israel because that messes up their false paradigm.
[01:04:56.596 --> 01:04:58.357]  Because they're handled by federal agents.
[01:05:00.776 --> 01:05:05.982]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:10.007]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:15.933]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.933 --> 01:05:20.779]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.979 --> 01:05:21.900]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:27.527]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:27.527 --> 01:05:28.187]  Number 4.
[01:05:28.187 --> 01:05:31.091]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:34.755]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:34.755 --> 01:05:35.616]  Number 5.
[01:05:35.616 --> 01:05:39.240]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:45.184]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:06:01.067 --> 01:06:04.090]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:09.415]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.415 --> 01:06:11.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.476 --> 01:06:16.481]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.481 --> 01:06:17.382]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.642 --> 01:06:18.763]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.763 --> 01:06:20.644]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:21.725]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.725 --> 01:06:23.926]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:25.267]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.267 --> 01:06:26.788]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:32.052]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:32.052 --> 01:06:35.654]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.654 --> 01:06:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:40.678]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.678 --> 01:06:41.578]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.578 --> 01:06:42.698]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.619]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.619 --> 01:06:44.719]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.719 --> 01:06:47.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.541]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:50.461]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:03.934]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:03.934 --> 01:07:09.275]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:11.316]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.316 --> 01:07:16.317]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.317 --> 01:07:17.497]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.497 --> 01:07:18.617]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:20.498]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.498 --> 01:07:21.578]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.578 --> 01:07:23.778]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:25.119]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.119 --> 01:07:25.719]  Will it make your
[01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:26.179]  We're good.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.561]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.623]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.623 --> 01:07:49.804]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:50.865]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:51.185]  Big Brother.
[01:07:51.185 --> 01:07:51.966]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:10.571]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.571 --> 01:08:12.152]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.152 --> 01:08:13.733]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:17.917]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.917 --> 01:08:24.722]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.722 --> 01:08:31.387]  They're saying the last of the great shoe-leather detective journalist is dead, Robert Novak.
[01:08:33.031 --> 01:08:37.134]  He died at 78 of brain cancer, or so they admitted.
[01:08:37.134 --> 01:08:41.697]  Infected over 200 million Americans with the SV40 and the polio shot alone.
[01:08:41.697 --> 01:08:45.359]  Most of us out there will die of what was put in our vaccines.
[01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:48.741]  Good bet that killed him, but dead of brain cancer.
[01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:52.444]  Always love your country, but don't trust your governments.
[01:08:52.444 --> 01:08:53.384]  A Novak quote.
[01:08:53.384 --> 01:08:53.845]  So he's dead.
[01:08:54.888 --> 01:09:02.394]  Speaking of healthcare, everybody wants to get into the United States for healthcare, but now it's been overrun by 30 million illegal aliens, bankrupting the states.
[01:09:02.394 --> 01:09:05.576]  The feds want to take 20% on average, they say 15 to 25 depending, or more.
[01:09:10.365 --> 01:09:11.045]  of your paycheck.
[01:09:11.045 --> 01:09:12.446]  It's just a new way to grab your paycheck.
[01:09:12.446 --> 01:09:17.367]  But, Jaren pointed something out that I often think when I'm watching CNN or MSNBC.
[01:09:17.367 --> 01:09:27.609]  It's done like a Billy Mays, in Jaren's words during the break, it's true, a Billy Mays, you know, the infomercial king, for five-year-olds with lobotomies.
[01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:29.970]  And they now talk to you very slow.
[01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:38.132]  Healthcare plans save you money, Jaren, because they're targeting the fluoride heads.
[01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:39.152]  You were just commenting on it.
[01:09:39.412 --> 01:09:55.690]  We just turned up the volume on CNN in there they had a what what piqued my interest they actually had something said why do people hate health care and then right below it 20% lower premiums question mark and then they they actually had little potato head type drawings like cartoons on the touchscreen
[01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:57.932]  And it said, will this help John?
[01:09:57.932 --> 01:09:59.413]  Will healthcare help John?
[01:09:59.413 --> 01:10:02.175]  And she just draws an arrow to his pocket and says, yeah!
[01:10:02.175 --> 01:10:03.335]  Yeah, it'll help John.
[01:10:03.335 --> 01:10:06.137]  It'll help his pocketbook and his back will feel better.
[01:10:06.137 --> 01:10:08.078]  Literally, like it's for five-year-olds.
[01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:09.699]  And I'm smarter than a five-year-old.
[01:10:09.699 --> 01:10:10.419]  So I saw through it.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:16.905]  Well, that's the incredible part is what they're putting in the water, what they're putting in the food.
[01:10:16.905 --> 01:10:23.891]  I go to public events, I went to Slitterbond this weekend, and I was watching people while you're stuck in line for 20 minutes to ride a water slide with your kids.
[01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:25.153]  They can hardly talk now.
[01:10:25.153 --> 01:10:29.316]  They're like, and it didn't matter.
[01:10:30.635 --> 01:10:40.118]  And I talk to folks from Europe that come here, and if they're from, say, Ireland, a cop will say, hey, on the side of the street, hey, I hear your voice, do you play golf?
[01:10:40.118 --> 01:10:42.038]  Thinking Ireland is Scotland.
[01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:44.939]  And then, are you from a different state in the U.S.
[01:10:44.939 --> 01:10:45.859]  where they talk like that?
[01:10:45.859 --> 01:10:49.821]  And the person's like, excuse me, you know, I'm from England, or I'm from Germany.
[01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:54.142]  And they'll say, you mean like a German resort?
[01:10:54.142 --> 01:10:57.543]  Or you mean like, average people don't know there's other countries now?
[01:10:58.303 --> 01:10:59.264]  I'm not kidding, Jaren.
[01:10:59.264 --> 01:11:00.646]  I think it's worse than we thought.
[01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:08.213]  It's either you've got awake people that somehow, genetically or whatever, aren't as affected by the chemicals in the water and the food, but we're somewhat still brain damaged.
[01:11:08.213 --> 01:11:08.934]  It's clear.
[01:11:08.934 --> 01:11:11.256]  We all kind of look poisoned or half-retarded.
[01:11:11.256 --> 01:11:14.739]  But then you've got the rest of the public that are just literally succumbing.
[01:11:14.739 --> 01:11:16.801]  Or is it some kind of mind trance through the TV?
[01:11:16.801 --> 01:11:20.124]  Because I'm watching television now, and a lot of it is like
[01:11:20.939 --> 01:11:25.584]  Like I'm in kindergarten again, it's like, does Billy like the free healthcare?
[01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:28.007]  No he don't, he bad man!
[01:11:28.007 --> 01:11:34.474]  And I'm not trying to be mean, I mean folks, they have like a retardation beam or something they're using on people?
[01:11:34.474 --> 01:11:35.875]  It's pretty insulting.
[01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:41.181]  I noticed if you want to argue somebody over the merits of healthcare, if you watch the news...
[01:11:42.142 --> 01:11:57.974]  So let's say like watch CNN in the morning and you're having a debate with somebody at night you can tell what they're gonna say next you it's just bullet point bullet point nobody has a creative thought it's just they're just running down the list of what what they just saw on the news and it's just well
[01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.275]  I'm going to go back to calls.
[01:11:59.275 --> 01:12:01.157]  I'm going to go back to calls, Jeremy.
[01:12:01.157 --> 01:12:03.339]  Remember the Wall Street Journal lady that was here for a day?
[01:12:03.339 --> 01:12:04.099]  Yeah.
[01:12:04.099 --> 01:12:07.723]  And she begged to come and said, I promise it's not a hit piece.
[01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.084]  I promise we're going to do the piece.
[01:12:09.084 --> 01:12:11.726]  And I told her, very nice lady, Sarah McBride.
[01:12:11.726 --> 01:12:13.268]  I have her email right here.
[01:12:13.268 --> 01:12:16.691]  She'd been writing for him for almost a decade, one of their big writers.
[01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:20.034]  I said, Sarah, if you don't write a hit piece, it will not be published.
[01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:21.676]  And she said, I've never had a piece turned down.
[01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:23.844]  No, that's not going to happen.
[01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:26.866]  And she read me big parts of the piece over the phone.
[01:12:26.866 --> 01:12:31.889]  It isn't a hit piece, but it was definitely 55% on their side, 45% mine.
[01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:35.271]  I mean, it had people attacking me and professors she interviewed.
[01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:40.635]  It was like a 1,300 word, huge, going to be front page with my face on the Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:41.687 --> 01:12:49.551]  And they overrode the head editor, and someone from corporate told them, no, we're not promoting Alex Jones.
[01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:56.094]  So, and I told, and she says in the email, and she also called Rob Due yesterday and wants me to call her, Alex, I don't know how you, cause she laughed at me.
[01:12:56.094 --> 01:12:59.656]  She said, they've never, hundreds of articles I've written never killed a story.
[01:12:59.656 --> 01:13:00.896]  And I said, well, get ready.
[01:13:00.896 --> 01:13:05.098]  But I said, just for your education, you can come here and waste my time.
[01:13:05.098 --> 01:13:08.280]  And I told the Psychology Today guy that, and that's certainly a hit piece too, but,
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.902]  They're digging around for dirt, they haven't published it yet.
[01:13:11.902 --> 01:13:16.204]  In fact, let's call Rob Dewey in here to talk about this.
[01:13:16.204 --> 01:13:17.745]  Rob, come on in here and talk about it.
[01:13:17.745 --> 01:13:22.167]  You were there when I kept telling her over the phone, and then I told her, no I'm not doing it, and then she begged.
[01:13:22.167 --> 01:13:30.212]  I mean, look, I was there when a huge director who made Some Kind of Monster, Brothers Keeper, Paradise Lost,
[01:13:31.434 --> 01:13:40.137]  All these top films, as big as Michael Moore's films, and he made a $3.4 million TV series with me in it.
[01:13:40.137 --> 01:13:50.020]  I wasted all this time, and then he wouldn't turn it into a hit piece, and they just said, fine, your contract says you got final cut, our contract says we can shelve it, and shelved for over a year.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.501]  But you talked to her yesterday, tell folks what she said.
[01:13:53.501 --> 01:14:00.163]  Yeah, she called up and said, well, Rob, this is, she gave her name, I'm just gonna say her first name, it's Sarah,
[01:14:00.683 --> 01:14:03.784]  Sarah McBride, there's no secret!
[01:14:03.784 --> 01:14:05.484]  No, you're right.
[01:14:05.484 --> 01:14:08.905]  And anyway, she said, I will have some bad news.
[01:14:08.905 --> 01:14:18.108]  One of the executives who I guess read the article said they didn't want to give as much space to somebody like Alex Jones, and then he went on vacation.
[01:14:18.108 --> 01:14:21.069]  So, shelved the article and went on vacation for two weeks.
[01:14:22.089 --> 01:14:27.796]  And she said, you know, it's exactly like Alex said, you know, she said it's exactly like he predicted.
[01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:33.002]  So I guess when you were talking with her, you predicted that they weren't going to run the article if she was doing something truthful.
[01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:37.748]  Yeah, I mean, it was a hit piece, but it didn't say that I'd murdered children or it didn't say that I...
[01:14:39.109 --> 01:14:41.270]  You know, I'm a drug trafficker.
[01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:42.090]  Right.
[01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:44.011]  Or some other lie.
[01:14:44.011 --> 01:14:46.492]  And so it's dead.
[01:14:46.492 --> 01:14:51.033]  But I want the executives of the Wall Street Journal to know I could care less.
[01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:53.094]  This is why we turn down most interviews.
[01:14:53.094 --> 01:14:55.555]  She just kept begging and called Ted Anderson.
[01:14:55.555 --> 01:14:57.976]  And I said, Ted, I'll do this because you're asking me to.
[01:14:57.976 --> 01:14:59.216]  But I said, it's not going to run.
[01:14:59.216 --> 01:15:01.057]  And I said, next time leave me alone about it.
[01:15:01.337 --> 01:15:01.557]  Yeah.
[01:15:01.557 --> 01:15:03.279]  Because I get these calls every day from Genesis.
[01:15:03.279 --> 01:15:05.402]  Hey, this newspaper wants to talk to you.
[01:15:05.402 --> 01:15:07.505]  This magazine wants to talk to you.
[01:15:07.505 --> 01:15:09.687]  And just no, I don't want to hear it.
[01:15:09.687 --> 01:15:13.091]  I'm not doing interviews for no reason anymore.
[01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:13.412]  Okay?
[01:15:13.412 --> 01:15:15.655]  I've done it over and over and over and over again.
[01:15:15.655 --> 01:15:19.539]  And the only way it goes in the newspaper is if it's a lying hit piece.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:27.205]  Okay, and she wrote a piece that, you know, wasn't flattering towards me at all, but they know it's just going to send people to me to find out who the real Alex is.
[01:15:27.205 --> 01:15:29.226]  See, hit pieces actually help us.
[01:15:29.226 --> 01:15:43.516]  When somebody says I'm a murderer, or somebody says I'm a drug dealer, or somebody says I'm a killer, or somebody says that I work for the Israelis, or the Vatican, or the Russians, or the Al-Qaeda training camps, that's another one.
[01:15:43.516 --> 01:15:48.820]  If I ever really get attacked on something real, which there's really no skeletons, so there's nothing to attack me on, all it is work all day,
[01:15:49.696 --> 01:15:54.699]  I'm a family man, very clean cut, don't even drink or smoke anymore.
[01:15:54.699 --> 01:16:01.184]  If, if, if, if I ever did do something bad, no one's going to believe it because they've been acclimated with total crap all day.
[01:16:01.184 --> 01:16:04.186]  But the issue here is all these attack pieces actually help me.
[01:16:04.186 --> 01:16:10.530]  And these more sophisticated, guaranteed spooks high up in Wall Street Journal, they know, they know that's only going to help me.
[01:16:12.111 --> 01:16:14.873]  But understand, you didn't have some victory over me doing this.
[01:16:14.873 --> 01:16:17.294]  You're the fools, you executives of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:16:17.294 --> 01:16:19.335]  Do you get told not to give your kids vaccines?
[01:16:19.335 --> 01:16:19.635]  No.
[01:16:19.635 --> 01:16:22.837]  Do you get told to not drink the tap water with hundreds of different chemicals in it?
[01:16:22.837 --> 01:16:25.118]  We've gotten a tour of the water system here in Austin.
[01:16:25.118 --> 01:16:28.600]  The name fluoride is over 100, depending on which brand.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.322]  It could be over 300.
[01:16:31.322 --> 01:16:32.402]  It varies.
[01:16:32.402 --> 01:16:35.244]  Fluorosilic acid is what the catch-all phrase is.
[01:16:35.504 --> 01:16:37.185]  Yeah, and that's what the city of Austin told you.
[01:16:37.185 --> 01:16:44.169]  Yeah, and they said, straight up, we get it from Florida and it comes right out of these plants, but it's cleaned and processed.
[01:16:44.169 --> 01:16:47.731]  But then you saw how it was holes eaten in the concrete where a few drops had dripped.
[01:16:47.731 --> 01:16:48.792]  It's horrible.
[01:16:48.792 --> 01:16:50.693]  I can't believe we put this in our water.
[01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:56.596]  And I mean, honestly, if I didn't have to earn a living, that's all I would be fighting this tooth and nail.
[01:16:56.596 --> 01:16:57.837]  I mean, exactly.
[01:16:57.837 --> 01:16:59.418]  But I mean, my only point is,
[01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:04.291]  The vaccines are killing people.
[01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:07.634]  The water and the GMO, pharmacological, they're designing it.
[01:17:07.634 --> 01:17:12.517]  They can go in and design the corn, design the wheat, to sterilize you, to give you cancer.
[01:17:12.517 --> 01:17:13.358]  They admit it!
[01:17:13.358 --> 01:17:14.759]  They brag!
[01:17:14.759 --> 01:17:19.082]  That's what matters, not getting caught up in the personality of Alex Jones.
[01:17:19.082 --> 01:17:22.325]  They hate me because I put out issues.
[01:17:22.325 --> 01:17:26.108]  And again, it doesn't hurt me at the Wall Street Journal that they did that.
[01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:28.289]  I did this to educate your reporter.
[01:17:28.289 --> 01:17:30.131]  And now she knows it's all real.
[01:17:30.131 --> 01:17:31.272]  It's not funny anymore.
[01:17:31.872 --> 01:17:36.156]  So I decided since she begged and pleaded to let her come and let her see for herself.
[01:17:36.156 --> 01:17:36.917]  Yeah.
[01:17:36.917 --> 01:17:37.577]  And you were nice to her.
[01:17:37.577 --> 01:17:38.558]  You gave her plenty of time.
[01:17:38.558 --> 01:17:40.500]  I also did it so Ted is a nice guy.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.002]  Well, you know, he was like, come on, Alex.
[01:17:42.002 --> 01:17:43.203]  It's the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:43.203 --> 01:17:44.184]  She kept calling him.
[01:17:44.184 --> 01:17:46.186]  And I said, OK, last time, Ted.
[01:17:46.186 --> 01:17:46.386]  Yeah.
[01:17:46.386 --> 01:17:47.887]  Originally, you said no.
[01:17:47.887 --> 01:17:50.430]  We talked to her and you're like, no, I'm not going to do it.
[01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:51.090]  I'm
[01:18:05.987 --> 01:18:07.448]  They're questioning me.
[01:18:25.299 --> 01:18:26.660]  They're not dying, Rob!
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.823]  It's not... They're not... Well, have you heard how it's a mental illness now to not drink tap water?
[01:18:30.823 --> 01:18:31.324]  Oh, yeah!
[01:18:31.324 --> 01:18:32.204]  Oh, yeah!
[01:18:32.204 --> 01:18:34.446]  That was in the Wall Street Journal, actually.
[01:18:34.446 --> 01:18:36.187]  It was on... In fact, print, exactly!
[01:18:36.187 --> 01:18:36.948]  I'm gonna go get that.
[01:18:36.948 --> 01:18:37.488]  Yeah, I'll go get that.
[01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:40.611]  It's mentally ill, Rob, to not drink your... Did you see that one?
[01:18:40.611 --> 01:18:42.492]  Mexican Army takes over customs on U.S.
[01:18:42.492 --> 01:18:42.813]  border.
[01:18:42.813 --> 01:18:44.814]  Yeah.
[01:18:44.814 --> 01:18:45.875]  AP!
[01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:46.395]  Uh-huh.
[01:18:46.395 --> 01:18:48.617]  Here's an interesting email we got, too.
[01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:50.779]  And we've already been sent posters of this.
[01:18:50.779 --> 01:18:52.040]  Anti-flu shot.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.321]  Somebody wants to start a contest.
[01:18:53.911 --> 01:18:57.434]  Yeah, we're going to have one that just says, don't drink the tap water.
[01:18:57.434 --> 01:19:03.738]  In fact, I meant to tell you this morning, have Janae make one with Obama, but her own style, like Bush, she's much better than the other one.
[01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:08.041]  I'm not knocking the one we went with, but I mean, she does a better job with the Joker one than the Bushy one.
[01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:12.625]  I want an Obama wild Joker with a smiling, I want him smiling.
[01:19:12.625 --> 01:19:14.886]  And then under it, I want to say, don't drink the water or
[01:19:16.823 --> 01:19:27.857]  I mean, people will know don't drink the water means the tap water, or it's in the water, or shouldn't say it's in the water, don't drink the tap water, or don't drink the water.
[01:19:27.857 --> 01:19:30.500]  Or don't take the shot.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.942]  Or flu shot kills.
[01:19:33.194 --> 01:19:37.095]  Okay, so we're going to launch that with another $1,000, but I'll do it next week because I want to have this winner.
[01:19:37.095 --> 01:19:38.896]  But yeah, but tell her, go ahead and make it.
[01:19:38.896 --> 01:19:39.136]  Okay.
[01:19:39.136 --> 01:19:41.016]  Because we've seen the power of this.
[01:19:41.016 --> 01:19:42.217]  Let's continue it.
[01:19:42.217 --> 01:19:44.617]  No, it's all over the local news.
[01:19:44.617 --> 01:19:46.918]  People are sending us links from all over local news.
[01:19:46.918 --> 01:19:56.001]  In fact, I know we've kind of gotten conditioned, acclimated to not care, but when you get Kurt and Paul to create a master page with links to all the newscasts, all the... I mean, it's incredible.
[01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:59.882]  From Tokyo to Berlin, from London to Buenos Aires to Austin, Texas.
[01:20:00.965 --> 01:20:07.668]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.668 --> 01:20:09.349]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.349 --> 01:20:13.931]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:13.931 --> 01:20:21.594]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.594 --> 01:20:24.075]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.235 --> 01:20:26.456]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:20:26.456 --> 01:20:28.397]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:20:28.397 --> 01:20:32.719]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.

[01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:31.661]  I love that song.

[01:24:40.723 --> 01:24:46.344]  Good parts coming up right here.
[01:24:46.344 --> 01:24:46.985]  I forget the name.
[01:24:46.985 --> 01:24:48.265]  This is some Russian band.
[01:24:48.265 --> 01:24:53.086]  This is like from the early 1990s.
[01:24:53.086 --> 01:24:57.447]  Alright, let's continue with your phone call.
[01:24:57.447 --> 01:24:58.547]  Cindy in Delaware.
[01:24:59.591 --> 01:25:00.252]  You're on the air.
[01:25:00.252 --> 01:25:02.013]  Welcome.
[01:25:02.013 --> 01:25:03.214]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:03.214 --> 01:25:05.656]  I hope you give me more than a minute on this.
[01:25:05.656 --> 01:25:14.103]  I have, here in Dover, Delaware, we had, it was like ground zero for the experimental anthrax vaccine.
[01:25:14.103 --> 01:25:14.963]  Do you remember that?
[01:25:14.963 --> 01:25:15.044]  Yes.
[01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:17.305]  It was making the pilots sick.
[01:25:17.305 --> 01:25:21.649]  Okay, well, I pulled up a news journal article.
[01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:26.673]  If anyone wants to Google this, it's XDAFB for Dover Air Force Base.
[01:25:26.673 --> 01:25:29.215]  Commander says troops used as guinea pigs.
[01:25:29.753 --> 01:25:34.954]  Interestingly enough, this colonel who stood up for his troops there lives in Texas.
[01:25:34.954 --> 01:25:37.055]  Maybe you can get him on your program.
[01:25:37.055 --> 01:25:40.896]  His name is Colonel Felix Greider.
[01:25:40.896 --> 01:25:43.196]  You know why he said no?
[01:25:43.196 --> 01:25:49.618]  They started giving the first rounds and people were collapsing and having autoimmune diseases and people died.
[01:25:49.618 --> 01:25:57.960]  You can just search engine the term local vet dies after anthrax shot or local vet paralyzed and it killed tens of thousands of them.
[01:25:59.395 --> 01:26:02.976]  Can I read you something really quick that I think is very important here?
[01:26:02.976 --> 01:26:03.076]  Sure.
[01:26:03.076 --> 01:26:11.997]  Because, you know, it had the squalene in it, which is the same thing that's going to be in the swine flu vaccine, which makes the body... Yeah, and again, squalene doesn't hurt you if you eat a little bit of it.
[01:26:11.997 --> 01:26:14.898]  It's the fact when it's in the bloodstream with... Injected.
[01:26:14.898 --> 01:26:22.799]  With the pathogen, it causes a giant autoimmune response, and every organ in the brain swells.
[01:26:22.799 --> 01:26:23.379]  Okay.
[01:26:23.379 --> 01:26:26.660]  This is out of the news, investigative reporter.
[01:26:27.105 --> 01:26:37.511]  Of the first 50 batches of vaccine distributed worldwide for the mandatory inoculations, only five contained squalene, and those were all shipped to Dover.
[01:26:37.511 --> 01:26:44.975]  After denying for more than a year that there was squalene in the vaccinations given at Dover, the Air Force admitted in 2000 that it had been wrong.
[01:26:44.975 --> 01:26:47.716]  Now here's the next piece of the puzzle.
[01:26:47.716 --> 01:26:53.319]  The five batches of vaccine sent to Dover contained increasing concentrations of squalene,
[01:26:53.783 --> 01:26:55.945]  Food and Drug Administration Test Show.
[01:26:55.945 --> 01:27:05.514]  Some top scientists say the pattern of squaling concentration could indicate that the military was measuring the troops response to different dosages.
[01:27:05.514 --> 01:27:08.357]  Well of course they were!
[01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:09.979]  This is not just coincidence.
[01:27:11.414 --> 01:27:15.557]  No, when you join the military, you join to be used and abused.
[01:27:15.557 --> 01:27:17.159]  It has nothing to do with America.
[01:27:17.159 --> 01:27:26.126]  The military is owned and run by the globalists, and we won't get our country back until the military admits to themselves, this government isn't our government.
[01:27:26.126 --> 01:27:29.509]  Just like under Hitler, he got control of the German military.
[01:27:29.509 --> 01:27:31.310]  It was then illegitimate.
[01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:33.552]  And they just, they don't care.
[01:27:33.552 --> 01:27:35.954]  They just want illegal aliens and criminals for the military now.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:47.625]  Alex, I had bought that Anthrax War movie from you, from your show, and boy, that's something I've been following the dead microbiologist for years.
[01:27:47.625 --> 01:27:51.968]  And I'll tell you, when you put all the pieces together, it doesn't look good.
[01:27:51.968 --> 01:27:53.468]  It is an amazing documentary.
[01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:54.189]  Thank you, Cindy.
[01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:57.510]  Bob in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:58.471]  Alex?
[01:27:58.471 --> 01:27:59.551]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:59.551 --> 01:28:00.932]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:28:00.932 --> 01:28:04.634]  I'd like to thank you on behalf of all Americans that remember what freedom once was.
[01:28:05.492 --> 01:28:06.332]  Well, don't thank me.
[01:28:06.332 --> 01:28:09.054]  I'm just trying to survive and get freedom for my children.
[01:28:09.054 --> 01:28:14.977]  Look, I'm only dealing with any person with half a brain would do if they were aware of this information.
[01:28:14.977 --> 01:28:18.158]  Well, the big reason I called you is because I know you love your children.
[01:28:18.158 --> 01:28:21.260]  I wanted to tell you what happened in my situation.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.421]  I've lost two children.
[01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:25.842]  My youngest, to shots.
[01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:30.164]  I had a toddler walking, talking, eating with a fork, laughing, asking questions.
[01:28:30.164 --> 01:28:31.584]  I took him to get his shots.
[01:28:31.584 --> 01:28:32.525]  He came home with a fever.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.842]  And as the fever wore off, I never talked to him again.
[01:28:36.842 --> 01:28:38.843]  That was 12 years ago.
[01:28:38.843 --> 01:28:44.646]  The difference between when I took him and when I brought him home, you can't tell me that it's some natural phenomenon.
[01:28:44.646 --> 01:28:47.508]  This is something that came in these shots.
[01:28:47.508 --> 01:28:55.192]  And I lost another child to the school systems that my child got picked on repeatedly.
[01:28:55.192 --> 01:29:00.896]  And his principal, it was brought before his principal in a speech and they told him to be a man about it.
[01:29:00.896 --> 01:29:01.436]  And I told him,
[01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:06.009]  What I thought, stand up to these kids and they beat him up.
[01:29:06.009 --> 01:29:09.170]  He hurt his feelings so bad he didn't go back to school.
[01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:14.751]  He had a friend that was diagnosed ADD or ADHD and didn't take his meds.
[01:29:14.751 --> 01:29:16.131]  Gave them to my kid.
[01:29:16.131 --> 01:29:23.313]  He took them, hallucinated, saw the devil in himself, and I lost my precious, excellent,
[01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:25.191]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:29:25.191 --> 01:29:31.215]  No, it's, it's, again, the death and carnage is in the millions, in the mega-deaths all over the western world.
[01:29:31.215 --> 01:29:40.921]  They're killing our children, drugging them, teaching them how to commit suicide with anti-suicide education classes that actually teach them how to do it, uh, with the drugs, with the shots.
[01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:44.763]  Was your son 18 months old when they soft-killed him?
[01:29:44.763 --> 01:29:45.363]  Yeah.
[01:29:45.363 --> 01:29:48.626]  Yeah, that's when that builds up to, then, that's what it's designed to do.
[01:29:48.626 --> 01:29:49.186]  God bless you.
[01:29:49.186 --> 01:29:50.587]  I'm sorry to hear they killed your children.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:55.311]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.311 --> 01:29:58.018]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.589 --> 01:30:04.831]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:06.832]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:30:06.832 --> 01:30:15.356]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:30:15.356 --> 01:30:20.898]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:30:20.898 --> 01:30:22.519]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:30:22.779 --> 01:30:29.281]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[01:31:00.495 --> 01:31:05.802]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.802 --> 01:31:10.328]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.328 --> 01:31:12.611]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.611 --> 01:31:14.233]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.233 --> 01:31:15.275]  There is a solution.

[01:32:00.845 --> 01:32:05.368]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:32:05.368 --> 01:32:07.949]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:32:07.949 --> 01:32:08.830]  He was devastated.
[01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:17.615]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:32:17.615 --> 01:32:23.819]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:32:23.819 --> 01:32:26.521]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:32:26.521 --> 01:32:28.902]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:32:29.963 --> 01:32:30.183]  I think so.
[01:32:52.725 --> 01:32:54.207]  Own Myself.com.
[01:32:54.207 --> 01:32:57.991]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:32:57.991 --> 01:33:00.474]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:33:19.206 --> 01:33:23.870]  All right, I want to get into how we're entering the second American Revolution, the flu news.
[01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:25.371]  We're going to do that in a moment.
[01:33:25.371 --> 01:33:26.552]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:33:26.552 --> 01:33:28.714]  Charles in Rhode Island.
[01:33:28.714 --> 01:33:29.835]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:33:29.835 --> 01:33:31.096]  Go ahead.
[01:33:31.096 --> 01:33:36.220]  Greetings and salutations, freedom fighter extraordinaire.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:37.001]  What's on your mind, buddy?
[01:33:37.697 --> 01:33:44.439]  Well, I want to tell you an idea, but I'm going to just do a little plug here for 12-160-Ning.
[01:33:44.439 --> 01:33:52.601]  We're the core group that left your InfoWars social, and we ended up over at Ning there, so that's what happened to your InfoWars social.
[01:33:52.601 --> 01:33:55.742]  I don't know what you're talking about, but go ahead.
[01:33:55.742 --> 01:33:58.303]  Remember how you had the InfoWars social a couple years ago?
[01:33:59.142 --> 01:34:04.106]  Oh yeah, and my IT guys couldn't make it work, it got too big.
[01:34:04.106 --> 01:34:17.197]  What happened is people would go launch their own scripts within it, and so it wasn't a hack on purpose, but it just wasn't designed to have 10,000, 20,000, whatever the members were, and so it was screwing it up.
[01:34:17.197 --> 01:34:19.699]  Yes, I know about the InfoWars Social, go ahead.
[01:34:19.699 --> 01:34:24.723]  Okay, so anyways, here's an idea, basically, that you've probably never heard before.
[01:34:25.518 --> 01:34:27.760]  And this is something that we could attack the government with.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.922]  I came up with this idea 12 years ago.
[01:34:29.922 --> 01:34:32.464]  I'm basically a progressive thinker.
[01:34:32.464 --> 01:34:39.210]  And I want you all to know, everybody out there in Radio Land, that a good idea has many mothers and many fathers.
[01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:43.895]  And basically the idea is, we own the government, don't we Alex?
[01:34:43.895 --> 01:34:52.002]  Yes, but a foreign private corporate consortium has come in and hijacked it through the mechanism of continuity of government.
[01:34:53.157 --> 01:34:58.360]  Okay, but since we really basically own the government, irregardless of who owns it, okay?
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.961]  And we're all well aware of that.
[01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:03.424]  The fact is that we can demand the government does something.
[01:35:03.424 --> 01:35:04.324]  Okay?
[01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:07.026]  And here's the basic idea of what we want the government to do.
[01:35:07.884 --> 01:35:08.565]  All right?
[01:35:08.565 --> 01:35:11.627]  We want the local and the state governments to stay at the level they are right now.
[01:35:11.627 --> 01:35:13.128]  It doesn't matter about them.
[01:35:13.128 --> 01:35:19.393]  But the federal government, we want it to revert, reset itself back to the 1789 U.S.
[01:35:19.393 --> 01:35:21.734]  Constitution and the First Amendment.
[01:35:21.734 --> 01:35:24.316]  Get rid of all the alphabet soup agencies.
[01:35:24.316 --> 01:35:27.699]  Get rid of all the congressmen and the president.
[01:35:27.699 --> 01:35:29.180]  Let the military all come back.
[01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:34.226]  I would like to live forever and I'd like to float around on fluffy clouds and everything would be great.
[01:35:34.226 --> 01:35:38.069]  I mean that's what we're pushing for is getting our Republic back.
[01:35:49.398 --> 01:35:52.740]  That's why they're using Homeland Security and the rest of it to suppress the people.
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:54.160]  That's what it was designed for.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.623]  That's why the Fed staged the terror attack against themselves as a pretext to crack down on the people.
[01:35:59.623 --> 01:36:01.964]  But what is your specific point, sir?
[01:36:01.964 --> 01:36:02.985]  I gotta move quick here.
[01:36:02.985 --> 01:36:15.011]  There's all these television shows and movies and books all about how somebody went through all these crises and then at the end of the book or the movie or whatever, they woke up from a dream and it didn't happen.
[01:36:15.011 --> 01:36:17.532]  And this is the way, you know, you would reset a counter.
[01:36:18.532 --> 01:36:25.554]  If you had a gate and you were counting people that came in to a certain place and there was a million people, you wanted to reset it back to zero again, you reset it.
[01:36:25.554 --> 01:36:29.515]  But the experiment of America didn't work.
[01:36:29.515 --> 01:36:32.255]  And if we reset it back to the 1789 U.S.
[01:36:32.255 --> 01:36:39.417]  Constitution, if we focused on that one issue altogether, that we want our government to be reset back to the 1789 U.S.
[01:36:39.417 --> 01:36:42.858]  Constitution, the locals of the state governments, they can stay at their place.
[01:36:42.858 --> 01:36:44.098]  The federal government has to reset it.
[01:36:45.171 --> 01:36:47.112]  Okay, Charles, I hear you.
[01:36:47.112 --> 01:36:47.772]  I hear you.
[01:36:47.772 --> 01:36:49.853]  I think that's what we're all working towards.
[01:36:49.853 --> 01:36:59.517]  So, yes, the problem is the criminals that live off of us, that run the local governments, they are teamed up with foreign corporations.
[01:36:59.517 --> 01:37:03.158]  We're going to have to remove them from power first.
[01:37:03.158 --> 01:37:05.739]  And they're going to use paramilitary forces against us.
[01:37:05.739 --> 01:37:06.759]  They are criminals.
[01:37:06.759 --> 01:37:08.220]  They are bank robbers.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.521]  Daryl in Texas, you're on the air, Daryl, go ahead.
[01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:23.104]  Alex, I wanted to ask you a question, I didn't mean to ask you a question about gun permits, and that is simple, I'll just put it out there and then I'll hang and let you talk.
[01:37:23.104 --> 01:37:26.208]  When you apply for any type of a gun permit, are you
[01:37:28.024 --> 01:37:29.804]  detracting from your right in any way.
[01:37:29.804 --> 01:37:35.785]  I've heard you talk before about common law and the fact that all you need is a second amendment and you don't need a permit.
[01:37:35.785 --> 01:37:41.026]  What types of things are you stepping into when you get a permit and you apply for one?
[01:37:41.026 --> 01:37:42.287]  Are you limiting yourself?
[01:37:42.287 --> 01:37:44.047]  Could you give me your take on that?
[01:37:44.047 --> 01:37:45.067]  Sure, thanks for the call.
[01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:50.948]  Look, it's a very simple issue but also very complex.
[01:37:50.948 --> 01:37:53.449]  Like most things that appear simple.
[01:37:53.449 --> 01:37:54.649]  What I was saying is
[01:37:56.482 --> 01:38:08.532]  That under the common law, the only type of firearm that's illegal is a concealed firearm.
[01:38:08.532 --> 01:38:19.281]  Because that's what criminals and thieves and people, that is the way historically they would conceal arms.
[01:38:19.281 --> 01:38:24.826]  Free men could carry a musket or a long rifle, a hatchet,
[01:38:26.778 --> 01:38:29.959]  A dagger, a sword, whatever they wanted.
[01:38:29.959 --> 01:38:34.961]  But if you concealed it, that was a serious criminal charge.
[01:38:34.961 --> 01:38:37.242]  The whole point was everyone was armed out in the open.
[01:38:37.242 --> 01:38:41.264]  It was a very polite and free society.
[01:38:41.264 --> 01:38:47.447]  So the federal government and the state governments don't have any jurisdiction to make you get a permit to carry a firearm.
[01:38:47.447 --> 01:38:51.929]  Unless they say, we'll give you a permit to carry it concealed.
[01:38:51.929 --> 01:38:55.130]  A permit is a right or authorization or letter of mark
[01:38:57.423 --> 01:39:02.764]  From the governing system to do something that would normally be illegal.
[01:39:02.764 --> 01:39:04.364]  Prohibited by law.
[01:39:04.364 --> 01:39:14.046]  So they can't give you a permit to carry a shotgun or a rifle or a handgun openly because it's not against the law.
[01:39:14.046 --> 01:39:24.248]  But through brainwashing and conditioning, they trained the public that you're not allowed to have a rifle in your car, you're not allowed to have a handgun.
[01:39:28.243 --> 01:39:29.003]  I have two clips.
[01:39:29.003 --> 01:39:42.468]  I have an AP clip, and I have another clip of him on YouTube, right where the idiot lady comes over after the music guys, telling my crew, and starts telling him, hey, put your gun down, that scares my kids, out in Phoenix yesterday.
[01:39:42.468 --> 01:39:53.392]  And when he gets talked to, he explains to people, if I don't have this gun openly, this AR-15, strapped around my shoulder,
[01:39:54.437 --> 01:39:55.838]  Then I will lose the right.
[01:39:55.838 --> 01:39:59.160]  I have to exercise this or like muscles it atrophies.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.902]  And there you see the federal marshal standing ten feet away.
[01:40:01.902 --> 01:40:03.323]  They're watching him.
[01:40:03.323 --> 01:40:04.604]  They don't look too concerned.
[01:40:04.604 --> 01:40:13.370]  Lord Obama, the little puppet, the front man.
[01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:16.833]  No, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:17.774]  It's a top story.
[01:40:17.774 --> 01:40:21.676]  There's one that's AP and then there's a YouTube from
[01:40:23.243 --> 01:40:27.745]  We Are Change San Antonio is the YouTube search you do.
[01:40:27.745 --> 01:40:28.506]  Yeah, there's the AP.
[01:40:28.506 --> 01:40:39.451]  You know, I said I wasn't going to get into the revolution that's happening, and I said I was going to get into all the vaccines and the rest of it.
[01:40:39.451 --> 01:40:40.351]  Maybe I should just do that.
[01:40:40.351 --> 01:40:46.094]  And I got Dr. Blaylock coming up about what these vaccines have been proven to actually do to people.
[01:40:50.552 --> 01:40:54.754]  But it is fundamental.
[01:40:54.754 --> 01:40:57.255]  It is criminal.
[01:40:57.255 --> 01:41:03.498]  It is done with malice of forethought.
[01:41:03.498 --> 01:41:07.320]  Consciously.
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:17.445]  When they put up billboards everywhere and say report illegal guns with an image of a rifle or a handgun, that's meant to create the image that guns are illegal because the government is criminal and does want your guns.
[01:41:17.445 --> 01:41:19.046]  Because slaves are disarmed.
[01:41:20.512 --> 01:41:25.477]  While the government arms to the teeth against the people, illegitimately, they want our guns.
[01:41:25.477 --> 01:41:35.707]  And so these people from Arizona to New Hampshire, from Texas to Vermont, from Oregon to Florida, are going to public demonstrations with guns openly.
[01:41:35.707 --> 01:41:36.808]  Now people have done that
[01:41:37.771 --> 01:41:39.352]  In Colorado.
[01:41:39.352 --> 01:41:43.636]  And been arrested and falsely charged and sent to prison for what's legal.
[01:41:43.636 --> 01:41:45.738]  That's how stupid the juries are.
[01:41:45.738 --> 01:41:53.425]  But these pieces on AP and CNN and the rest of it, where they're having to admit it's legal and lawful, that's the CNN headline.
[01:41:53.425 --> 01:41:56.748]  Man carries assault rifle to Obama protest and it's legal.
[01:42:06.681 --> 01:42:08.423]  So this is all part of the revolution.
[01:42:08.423 --> 01:42:24.721]  It's about us standing up and saying, we are not your slaves, we are not your property, we are not going along with any of this.
[01:42:24.721 --> 01:42:27.564]  We are not going to comply with this.
[01:42:34.574 --> 01:42:36.775]  We are not going to go along with this.
[01:42:36.775 --> 01:42:38.656]  Let's go ahead and play the AP clip.
[01:42:38.656 --> 01:42:44.419]  I may not have sent you guys the We Are Change Phoenix, or We Are Change Arizona, but it'll be on YouTube.
[01:42:44.419 --> 01:42:45.960]  I know it's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:48.442]  I know I watched it there this morning.
[01:42:48.442 --> 01:42:50.923]  Maybe it's on Prison Planet, but c'est la vie, whatever.
[01:42:50.923 --> 01:42:52.924]  Here's the audio from the AP one.
[01:42:52.924 --> 01:42:58.427]  But the other one is even better.
[01:42:58.427 --> 01:43:02.069]  The actual We Are Change one, because this idiot woman runs over and gets in his face.
[01:43:03.567 --> 01:43:09.532]  And he explains to her, she says, I'm upset by that.
[01:43:09.532 --> 01:43:12.594]  I'm threatened by that.
[01:43:12.594 --> 01:43:15.616]  And he says, well, usually people would be threatened by my black skin, lady.
[01:43:15.616 --> 01:43:17.477]  You know, get used to it.
[01:43:17.477 --> 01:43:18.418]  I'm not your slave.
[01:43:18.418 --> 01:43:27.385]  I mean, they're so scared seeing a fellow slave, a fellow American armed, but they love seeing the government armed.
[01:43:29.332 --> 01:43:37.094]  You know, in a lot of free countries, places like Switzerland, at least in the past, the cops didn't carry guns, but all the citizens did, because they didn't trust the government with guns!
[01:43:37.094 --> 01:43:40.934]  That's what a real free society's like, but now they've got it backwards!
[01:43:40.934 --> 01:43:43.895]  See, I'm not here to pull a plow for you, government!
[01:43:43.895 --> 01:43:47.636]  I know you think I am, but you're about to learn!
[01:43:47.636 --> 01:43:48.516]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[01:43:48.516 --> 01:43:50.436]  Here it is.
[01:43:50.436 --> 01:43:52.717]  Exercising my rights as an American in Arizona.
[01:43:55.803 --> 01:44:00.925]  I'm absolutely, totally against health care in this way, in this manner.
[01:44:00.925 --> 01:44:03.406]  Stealing it from people, I don't think that's appropriate.
[01:44:03.406 --> 01:44:06.848]  Tell me also, why was people afraid to come out here today?
[01:44:06.848 --> 01:44:21.614]  Well, I come from another state where open carry is legal, but no one does it, so the police don't really know about it, and they harass people, arrest people falsely, and I think that people need to get out and do it more so that they get kind of conditioned to it.
[01:44:21.614 --> 01:44:24.755]  So you're here specifically for open carry, or for health care?
[01:44:25.315 --> 01:44:35.101]  For Open Carry and also to remind people that a lot of people think we live in a democracy so that we can vote how the minority is going to live.
[01:44:35.101 --> 01:44:42.306]  If we want health care, as long as we get enough people, we'll just take money from you and we'll buy whatever we want, pay for whatever we want.
[01:44:42.306 --> 01:44:46.748]  I just think that in America, people have the ability to fight back and to resist.
[01:44:46.748 --> 01:44:49.630]  That's another reason why I'm here.
[01:44:52.745 --> 01:44:55.146]  All right, so there you have it.
[01:44:55.146 --> 01:44:57.827]  And later, text Mars only with us for 30 minutes.
[01:44:57.827 --> 01:45:02.128]  I'll play the We Are Change one when we're actually live at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:45:02.128 --> 01:45:03.669]  We Are Change Phoenix.
[01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:06.930]  I bet it's up on freedomsphoenix.com.
[01:45:06.930 --> 01:45:09.811]  That's their local site there.
[01:45:09.811 --> 01:45:12.712]  Okay.
[01:45:12.712 --> 01:45:20.135]  I know we have loaded phone lines here, and I tried to answer that caller's question as best I could.
[01:45:20.135 --> 01:45:20.935]  It does not
[01:45:26.323 --> 01:45:36.312]  In the contract, you sign wavier rights when you get a concealed carry, but it creates the common law perception of custom that you've got to get a permit to own a gun.
[01:45:36.312 --> 01:45:41.256]  And that's how the domestication started 60 plus years ago in Chicago and New York City.
[01:45:41.256 --> 01:45:44.799]  Anywhere mafia run, the mob has a way of disarming their slaves.
[01:45:44.799 --> 01:45:47.261]  This is a domestication process.
[01:45:47.261 --> 01:45:49.263]  Yeah, let's go ahead and actually found the clip.
[01:45:49.263 --> 01:45:50.744]  Let's play this moron woman.
[01:45:52.492 --> 01:45:58.146]  Coming over to him and self-righteously getting in his face the same
[01:45:59.747 --> 01:46:00.287]  Black guy.
[01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:01.708]  And boy, he did it just right.
[01:46:01.708 --> 01:46:06.010]  He's not wearing a mask or something that would discredit everything.
[01:46:06.010 --> 01:46:09.752]  He's clean-cut, in a dress shirt and black tie.
[01:46:09.752 --> 01:46:10.712]  He's sharp.
[01:46:10.712 --> 01:46:12.173]  He's well-spoken.
[01:46:12.173 --> 01:46:21.278]  He's got a wicked, nice, compact AR-15 slung over his back.
[01:46:21.278 --> 01:46:23.479]  It's just absolutely the image we want to project.
[01:46:24.298 --> 01:46:28.782]  Because if it had been a white guy, oh, they'd have said he was racist or whatever.
[01:46:28.782 --> 01:46:35.247]  So this is a perfect image compared to the image that was somewhat twisted from Pale Horse.
[01:46:35.247 --> 01:46:36.348]  Not that Pale Horse is bad.
[01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:38.850]  I think Pale Horse is legitimate after talking to him.
[01:46:38.850 --> 01:46:42.453]  We appreciate him coming on the show, but it certainly played into the media's hands.
[01:46:42.453 --> 01:46:44.175]  This is not playing into the media's hands.
[01:46:44.175 --> 01:46:45.135]  They don't like it.
[01:46:45.135 --> 01:46:45.536]  Here it is.
[01:46:46.904 --> 01:46:48.004]  It's not an automatic weapon.
[01:46:48.004 --> 01:46:49.525]  It's an AR-15 and it's semi-automatic.
[01:46:49.525 --> 01:46:52.066]  You have to defend yourself everywhere.
[01:46:52.066 --> 01:46:52.966]  Bad things happen everywhere.
[01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:07.913]  Okay, don't you think that the more guns people have, the more incidents of gun violence there's going to be?
[01:47:07.913 --> 01:47:08.373]  No, not at all.
[01:47:08.373 --> 01:47:11.735]  I mean, don't you think it's a little contrary?
[01:47:11.735 --> 01:47:14.857]  Statistics I've seen seem to reflect the exact opposite of this.
[01:47:14.857 --> 01:47:16.038]  Washington D.C.
[01:47:16.038 --> 01:47:18.339]  has more violence than any other state.
[01:47:18.339 --> 01:47:22.702]  It seems to me like the most violent places in the country are places that have the strictest gun laws.
[01:47:24.083 --> 01:47:26.604]  Washington, D.C.
[01:47:26.604 --> 01:47:32.528]  is an incredibly... D.C.
[01:47:32.528 --> 01:47:34.510]  is a very violent place.
[01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:35.390]  And they're the worst.
[01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:38.673]  They're the worst on the government.
[01:47:38.673 --> 01:47:40.834]  Just look at these morons going, D.C.
[01:47:40.834 --> 01:47:42.616]  doesn't allow guns.
[01:47:42.616 --> 01:47:47.799]  And it's the absolute pit of hell, the worst place in the world, in the industrialized world.
[01:47:47.799 --> 01:47:50.181]  Just absolutely hellish level of crime.
[01:47:52.915 --> 01:48:00.822]  I mean, just these domesticated morons want their kids to grow up in a society where they're total slaves.
[01:48:00.822 --> 01:48:02.123]  What is your problem, lady?
[01:48:02.123 --> 01:48:08.808]  Why is a citizen having a gun so scary, but you love the cameras and checkpoints and paramilitary police?
[01:48:08.808 --> 01:48:10.610]  You're a jackass, lady!
[01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:11.611]  Let's play her again.
[01:48:12.051 --> 01:48:16.294]  Well, there's a lot of things that make people nervous.
[01:48:16.294 --> 01:48:20.637]  At one point in time, my skin made a lot of people nervous if I was around their children.
[01:48:36.687 --> 01:48:38.688]  There you go!
[01:48:38.688 --> 01:48:44.630]  But if I'm not attacking them, if I'm not doing anything threatening towards them... So would you use it today if you had to?
[01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:50.052]  If someone was attacking you or me or anybody that I care about, any of my fellow citizens, I'd absolutely use it.
[01:48:50.052 --> 01:48:57.654]  I think they could handle the job, I think the police could handle it, but... How can you have free people freely protecting themselves with weapons?
[01:48:57.654 --> 01:48:59.155]  There's going to be problems.
[01:48:59.155 --> 01:49:00.515]  They're going to get stolen.
[01:49:00.515 --> 01:49:01.455]  Things are going to happen.
[01:49:01.455 --> 01:49:02.096]  You can't have...
[01:49:03.696 --> 01:49:07.883]  You know, like, if you have the freedom to drive, that means there's going to be accidents from time to time.
[01:49:07.883 --> 01:49:12.450]  There's no, there's no, you can't have it, you can't have freedom to drive and no accidents at the same time.
[01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:13.492]  That's impossible.
[01:49:13.492 --> 01:49:16.616]  Well, anyway, I just... Head pause.
[01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:17.798]  That is the, the key.
[01:49:19.165 --> 01:49:23.367]  If things are stagnant and safe, it's entropy and the whole thing rots and dies.
[01:49:23.367 --> 01:49:38.715]  If things are real, and strong, and serious, and men are men, and women are women, and cars were cars, as the saying goes, people were polite, because if you were rude to the wrong person, people were real friendly, because if you were rude to somebody, they'll punch you in the nose!
[01:49:38.715 --> 01:49:41.756]  And you didn't rob people's houses, because they'd kill you!
[01:49:41.756 --> 01:49:46.579]  Before they put sterilents in the water, to where our testicles shrivel up, and that's happened to everybody!
[01:49:47.523 --> 01:49:48.864]  I mean, folks, they're chemical weapon.
[01:49:48.864 --> 01:49:51.867]  They're turning us into a bunch of ninnies.
[01:49:51.867 --> 01:49:53.449]  I don't want to attack women.
[01:49:53.449 --> 01:49:54.630]  They're not turning us into women.
[01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:59.275]  They're turning us into these gelded, domesticated jellyfish.
[01:49:59.275 --> 01:50:04.840]  There's a reason men are running around and look like women now, because they're putting it in the water.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.861]  That's been documented.
[01:50:05.861 --> 01:50:07.803]  This is real.
[01:50:07.803 --> 01:50:11.347]  And you've got these domesticated sloths that are scared of somebody that isn't a slave.
[01:50:12.944 --> 01:50:17.386]  And that's what freedom's about, driving cars and firearms and life.
[01:50:17.386 --> 01:50:20.467]  It's about freedom, you domesticated chicken neck.
[01:50:20.467 --> 01:50:27.409]  And by the way, when you give up your rights for supposed protection, as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin both said, you get neither, you get tyranny.
[01:50:27.409 --> 01:50:30.470]  The greatest danger is letting the nanny state.
[01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:40.694]  See, the nanny state's really cold-blooded and evil, but it speaks to the cowardly, weak chicken necks and gets them to join forces with the state to come geld real men and real women.
[01:50:41.374 --> 01:50:42.354]  They hate us.
[01:50:42.354 --> 01:50:43.595]  They hate it we're free.
[01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:45.055]  They hate it we're strong.
[01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:46.976]  They hate it we can have all the kids we want.
[01:50:46.976 --> 01:50:50.537]  They hate it we got houses and swimming pools that can live good.
[01:50:50.537 --> 01:50:53.478]  The control freak eugenicists want to get rid of all that.
[01:50:53.478 --> 01:50:54.519]  They love death.
[01:50:54.519 --> 01:50:55.599]  They love weakness.
[01:50:55.599 --> 01:50:57.260]  They love rottenness.
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.920]  Nothing looks better than that man with that gun strapped to his back.
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:01.641]  It's beautiful!
[01:51:01.641 --> 01:51:02.901]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:51:02.901 --> 01:51:04.342]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:51:04.741 --> 01:51:06.582]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:51:06.582 --> 01:51:11.464]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:51:11.464 --> 01:51:16.486]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[01:51:16.486 --> 01:51:18.447]  Introducing Choose4Health.
[01:51:18.447 --> 01:51:23.089]  Choose4Health brings you 16 powerful ingredients in one delicious chewable.
[01:51:23.089 --> 01:51:29.152]  For around 75 cents per day, each chewable contains a full day's worth of the necessary fruit and vegetable intake you need.
[01:51:29.152 --> 01:51:33.654]  Choose4Health also contains antioxidants and vitamin B12 to give you that extra boost
[01:51:33.854 --> 01:51:34.614]  It is a big idea.
[01:52:03.746 --> 01:52:05.507]  A New World Order!
[01:52:05.507 --> 01:52:10.409]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:10.409 --> 01:52:13.251]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:13.251 --> 01:52:16.032]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:16.032 --> 01:52:19.214]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:19.214 --> 01:52:26.537]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:34.995]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:34.995 --> 01:52:38.877]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:38.877 --> 01:52:41.439]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:52:41.439 --> 01:52:42.600]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.400]  They're not after money.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.681]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:45.642]  They're after power.
[01:52:45.642 --> 01:52:46.803]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:52:46.803 --> 01:52:55.488]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.488 --> 01:52:58.330]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:52:58.330 --> 01:52:59.411]  You have been warned.
[01:53:00.848 --> 01:53:08.373]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:53:08.373 --> 01:53:12.877]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:53:12.877 --> 01:53:18.020]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:25.486]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:53:25.486 --> 01:53:29.869]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:36.192]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:53:36.192 --> 01:53:43.135]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:53:43.135 --> 01:53:48.618]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision dot com.

[01:54:04.179 --> 01:54:05.140]  Don't worry.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.183]  This show is documented.
[01:54:07.183 --> 01:54:10.087]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:10.087 --> 01:54:13.110]  This happens from time to time.
[01:54:13.110 --> 01:54:18.537]  That's fine because I got a bunch of video and audio clips I want to play.
[01:54:21.841 --> 01:54:27.663]  We're supposed to have Dr. Blaylock, the brain surgeon, on about the flu shots in this hour.
[01:54:27.663 --> 01:54:30.103]  We got the time zone scrambled.
[01:54:30.103 --> 01:54:31.424]  Our fault, not his.
[01:54:31.424 --> 01:54:34.905]  So, he'll either be on the last 30 minutes of the day or later in the week.
[01:54:34.905 --> 01:54:38.766]  I want Blaylock for a full hour regardless later because I want to get into these flu shots.
[01:54:38.766 --> 01:54:40.886]  From a brain surgeon.
[01:54:40.886 --> 01:54:42.847]  From a neurologist.
[01:54:42.847 --> 01:54:44.667]  From an expert.
[01:54:44.667 --> 01:54:45.168]  Okay?
[01:54:45.168 --> 01:54:46.208]  He'll tell you what's in them.
[01:54:46.208 --> 01:54:47.488]  He'll tell you what it's doing.
[01:54:47.488 --> 01:54:49.709]  But that is not my opinion.
[01:54:51.471 --> 01:54:54.792]  It is now mainstream news, the flu shots killing people.
[01:54:54.792 --> 01:55:05.317]  And hey, that's fortuitous that Blaylock may not be on today because I need to get in to the mainstream news of what these flu shots are doing to people and have a discussion about this.
[01:55:05.317 --> 01:55:16.782]  Because just like citizens are scared of other citizens with guns when there's no reason to be scared, and people are scared of sharks in the ocean eating them when there's one chance out of a billion you're going to get eaten,
[01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:27.872]  People are scared of things they shouldn't be scared of, and they're scared of things... People are scared of things they shouldn't be scared of, and they're not scared of things they should be scared of.
[01:55:27.872 --> 01:55:32.535]  Because the media tells people what to be scared of.
[01:55:32.535 --> 01:55:41.461]  In fact, we ought to create a poster that's a great white shark rising up out of the water with scary eyes and teeth, and under it say, don't drink the tap water.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:53.154]  That'd be an awesome t-shirt, because it gives you the archetypal monster, and it's coming out of the water, so there's that tie-in at a subconscious level, and then it says, don't drink the water.
[01:55:53.154 --> 01:55:54.876]  Don't drink the tap water.
[01:55:54.876 --> 01:55:56.298]  Is that not a good idea?
[01:55:57.557 --> 01:56:05.162]  And then people probably wouldn't, because at their mind number level they'd go, there be shark in water, me no drinky.
[01:56:05.162 --> 01:56:09.825]  Because they'll think a shark's going to come out of the tap into their glass.
[01:56:09.825 --> 01:56:13.607]  They'll start getting scared of the tap water area in their house.
[01:56:13.607 --> 01:56:14.688]  They're like two-year-olds.
[01:56:14.688 --> 01:56:18.850]  You tell them, big sharky come out of tappy, me not drinky.
[01:56:18.850 --> 01:56:20.131]  I mean, that's what they think.
[01:56:20.131 --> 01:56:22.833]  This patriot, this evil, it have gun.
[01:56:22.833 --> 01:56:23.733]  It bad.
[01:56:23.733 --> 01:56:25.274]  Take gunny then.
[01:56:28.814 --> 01:56:37.220]  I mean, this is how crazy the brainwashing is and how out of control it's all gotten.
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:41.583]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I've done two hours here and hadn't plugged me in as sponsors.
[01:56:41.583 --> 01:56:43.745]  Let me tell you about a few of those and we'll come back.
[01:56:43.745 --> 01:56:54.953]  And I'm just going to go ahead now and get into the flu shot, the Marshall Law, all of it, how it ties into the revolution that's happening, and then we'll see if Dr. Blaylock's popping in.
[01:56:54.953 --> 01:56:57.855]  Tex Marsh is coming on about the voodoo stuff going on at the White House, though.
[01:57:01.127 --> 01:57:05.383]  Reality is so much stranger than fiction, as they say.
[01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:08.450]  MySolarBackup.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:10.091]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:57:10.091 --> 01:57:11.772]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[01:57:11.772 --> 01:57:15.154]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:57:15.154 --> 01:57:19.896]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:57:19.896 --> 01:57:28.680]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800-watt generator and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:35.504]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:57:36.104 --> 01:57:39.287]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:57:39.287 --> 01:57:44.851]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:57:44.851 --> 01:57:47.373]  MySolarBackup.com, MySolarBackup.com, or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[01:57:47.373 --> 01:57:51.076]  And then one other sponsor I want to tell you about is Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net, Diginet.net, banneruponinfowars.com,
[01:58:06.564 --> 01:58:13.986]  And they have the best prices and the best systems on, and they really do, go check it out, on hidden cameras for your car.
[01:58:13.986 --> 01:58:27.749]  Very easy to install, takes a few minutes, has a hidden little memory disk, little memory card to record hours, admissible in court, little hidden pins that get audio and video admissible in court.
[01:58:27.749 --> 01:58:30.089]  They've got it all at incredibly low prices.
[01:58:30.089 --> 01:58:31.950]  Great service, great people, diginet.net.
[01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:36.294]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:58:36.294 --> 01:58:37.956]  Diginet dot net.
[01:58:37.956 --> 01:58:42.622]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:58:42.622 --> 01:58:46.027]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.027 --> 01:58:48.189]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.933 --> 01:58:56.136]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:56.136 --> 01:59:00.159]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.159 --> 01:59:06.062]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:06.062 --> 01:59:11.126]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.126 --> 01:59:11.586]  Number three,
[01:59:12.046 --> 01:59:18.329]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:59:18.329 --> 01:59:21.230]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:59:21.230 --> 01:59:25.752]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.752 --> 01:59:29.374]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

[01:59:56.272 --> 01:59:59.054]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.484 --> 02:00:10.308]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.308 --> 02:00:11.889]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.889 --> 02:00:13.451]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.451 --> 02:00:17.654]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.654 --> 02:00:25.821]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.821 --> 02:00:30.865]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are live for the third and fourth hour today.
[02:00:33.494 --> 02:00:38.216]  And we are going to be taking phone calls later.
[02:00:38.216 --> 02:00:42.617]  We have Tex Mars popping in in the next hour to talk about all these news headlines.
[02:00:42.617 --> 02:00:44.998]  Voodoo in the White House!
[02:00:44.998 --> 02:00:54.021]  Just search engine that term and you can read the different stories about another headline is Witchcraft in the White House.
[02:00:54.021 --> 02:00:55.382]  We're going over this because
[02:00:56.823 --> 02:00:59.484]  The establishment is on a witch hunt against Christians.
[02:00:59.484 --> 02:01:06.225]  They admit all over the country they CPS homeschoolers, Christian families, children, the neighbors are on a witch hunt.
[02:01:06.225 --> 02:01:09.226]  I'm not on a witch hunt against the real witches.
[02:01:09.226 --> 02:01:15.867]  I just want to point out that most of the world leaders we've researched on record are into the occult.
[02:01:15.867 --> 02:01:17.848]  Just search engine Sherry Blair.
[02:01:19.102 --> 02:01:25.828]  Which, Tony Blair is possessed by a spirit every morning, he believes, and flops around on the ground.
[02:01:25.828 --> 02:01:27.950]  That's mainstream British news, he admits it.
[02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:31.173]  He is so overtaken with the spirit of the light.
[02:01:32.395 --> 02:01:35.637]  As he calls it, be a Lucifer, the light bearer.
[02:01:35.637 --> 02:01:38.119]  I can't make this stuff up.
[02:01:38.119 --> 02:01:40.120]  We're going to show you some of those articles later.
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:48.406]  And then meanwhile, you got Obama's wife's mommy doing the santeria, the chickens, you know, running around, chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:01:48.406 --> 02:01:49.767]  This is all part of the new freedom.
[02:01:49.767 --> 02:01:52.649]  And when they said change, they meant it.
[02:01:52.649 --> 02:01:55.171]  But actually, this isn't really change, is it?
[02:01:55.171 --> 02:01:56.712]  Because we're going to cover that next hour.
[02:01:56.712 --> 02:02:01.996]  The occult is the norm in circles of power, not the exception.
[02:02:03.522 --> 02:02:08.086]  So that is coming up today.
[02:02:08.086 --> 02:02:13.851]  I want to spend a few segments now getting into the fact that we are going into revolution.
[02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:20.097]  The signs, the evidence is now overwhelming and even blowing me away how fast, how real, how huge it is.
[02:02:20.097 --> 02:02:25.422]  But that also confirms to me that the establishment is going to counter-strike.
[02:02:26.476 --> 02:02:29.618]  And it's gonna try to stage some crises.
[02:02:29.618 --> 02:02:31.159]  And then we'll take your phone calls.
[02:02:31.159 --> 02:02:32.840]  Dave, Brad, many others holding.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.741]  The toll-free number to join us today is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:34.741 --> 02:02:35.102]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:35.102 --> 02:02:36.943]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[02:02:36.943 --> 02:02:38.144]  But I wanted to go over
[02:02:50.683 --> 02:03:00.339]  all the articles we have and and this is without looking this is just like i said on the sunday show in the last few days hundreds and hundreds of articles are out there and and and we printed
[02:03:02.226 --> 02:03:04.789]  2030, I didn't count, big stacks of these.
[02:03:04.789 --> 02:03:21.208]  AP, AFP, German newspapers, British newspapers, London Telegraph, Sunday Mail, Financial Times of London, Moscow Times, Tokyo newspapers, about how the flu shot is killing people.
[02:03:22.543 --> 02:03:32.308]  The flu shot trials in the United States, mainly in Texas, are killing people, and the federal government is saying, keep this secret, don't let the public know about it.
[02:03:32.308 --> 02:03:34.970]  Now there's so many different angles to that.
[02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:45.115]  Not just that it's killing people, but that they would keep it quiet, and that every other time they do this it kills a bunch of people, and that they're clearly testing a soft kill operation saying, we'll be bold.
[02:03:45.535 --> 02:03:50.077]  We'll just give people shots out in the open that kill them and maim them and hurt them.
[02:03:50.077 --> 02:03:54.279]  I mean, they've already brain damaged millions of children, always at 18 months.
[02:03:54.279 --> 02:03:55.820]  The child gets the third round of shots.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:58.582]  They're running around, giggling, talking, laughing.
[02:03:58.582 --> 02:03:59.502]  Then they sit in the corner.
[02:03:59.502 --> 02:04:01.403]  I mean, I'm sad.
[02:04:01.403 --> 02:04:02.924]  It's very sad for the rest of their life.
[02:04:02.924 --> 02:04:09.307]  Just from the brain damage because the brain swells with the adjuvants and other things that are in it, not just the mercury.
[02:04:10.462 --> 02:04:13.524]  And, uh, that's your chemical lobotomy.
[02:04:13.524 --> 02:04:19.528]  Now, most people are only meant to be brain damaged by this, so that you're not a, you know, so you're kind of a drone.
[02:04:19.528 --> 02:04:26.233]  It's kind of like the movie Black Hole, where they're lobotomizing people to, you know, serve, uh, you know, the crazy scientist.
[02:04:26.233 --> 02:04:29.335]  Well, that's really what they're doing here.
[02:04:29.335 --> 02:04:29.876]  And, uh,
[02:04:30.916 --> 02:04:33.016]  Thirty years ago, you didn't see any autistic children.
[02:04:33.016 --> 02:04:35.677]  Now, some high schools, a third of them are.
[02:04:35.677 --> 02:04:36.537]  Whole wings.
[02:04:36.537 --> 02:04:38.958]  And they're just, the operation's going well.
[02:04:38.958 --> 02:04:48.620]  Now they're gonna soft kill you with autoimmune disease and other things, and people will just be everywhere dying in mass, and the news will say it's good, and everyone will love it, and roll their sleeves up and say, I'm ready!
[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:50.960]  I'm ready to lose 20 IQ points!
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:52.901]  I'm ready to have my organs shot down!
[02:04:52.901 --> 02:04:54.341]  I'm ready to have convulsions!
[02:04:54.341 --> 02:04:55.901]  I'm ready to be paralyzed!
[02:04:55.901 --> 02:04:57.021]  Give me the shot, right here!
[02:04:57.021 --> 02:04:58.742]  It's gonna be one hell of a ride!
[02:04:58.742 --> 02:04:59.582]  Ha ha!
[02:05:00.643 --> 02:05:02.005]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.005 --> 02:05:04.007]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:05:04.007 --> 02:05:04.988]  Well, you should.
[02:05:04.988 --> 02:05:09.493]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:05:09.493 --> 02:05:10.294]  That's right.
[02:05:10.294 --> 02:05:18.964]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:05:18.964 --> 02:05:20.325]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:05:20.325 --> 02:05:21.467]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:27.630]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:34.534]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:05:34.534 --> 02:05:40.057]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:05:40.057 --> 02:05:41.518]  This is real.
[02:05:41.518 --> 02:05:42.578]  Don't miss out.
[02:05:42.578 --> 02:05:49.442]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:06:01.264 --> 02:06:04.285]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.285 --> 02:06:09.626]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.626 --> 02:06:11.666]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.666 --> 02:06:16.667]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.667 --> 02:06:17.587]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.847 --> 02:06:18.968]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.968 --> 02:06:20.850]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:21.930]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.930 --> 02:06:24.132]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.132 --> 02:06:25.473]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.473 --> 02:06:26.995]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.995 --> 02:06:32.279]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.279 --> 02:06:35.862]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.862 --> 02:06:39.325]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.665 --> 02:06:40.887]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.887 --> 02:06:41.788]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.788 --> 02:06:42.889]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.889 --> 02:06:43.830]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:44.931]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.931 --> 02:06:47.975]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.975 --> 02:06:49.757]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.757 --> 02:06:50.678]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.222 --> 02:07:05.529]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.529 --> 02:07:10.055]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:12.338]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.338 --> 02:07:13.960]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.002]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.222 --> 02:07:23.647]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:07:43.158 --> 02:07:47.299]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:47.299 --> 02:07:51.679]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[02:07:51.679 --> 02:07:53.160]  866-762-9238.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:08:02.621]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:02.621 --> 02:08:09.242]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.242 --> 02:08:12.243]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.003 --> 02:08:31.813]  Okay, we're simulcasting now on PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color, and on screen we'll put a few of these articles, but it's not just the flu shot.
[02:08:31.813 --> 02:08:42.783]  Don't forget the Associated Press from two days ago that says polio surge in Nigeria after vaccine virus mutates.
[02:08:55.197 --> 02:09:01.821]  So we've got that going on.
[02:09:01.821 --> 02:09:14.128]  And I think about how it killed so many people in the 1976 swine flu outbreak, which started at a military base after they vaccinated troops.
[02:09:14.128 --> 02:09:22.973]  So after they vaccinate troops, all of this happens.
[02:09:22.973 --> 02:09:23.133]  And
[02:09:26.061 --> 02:09:36.103]  It's just, it's so obvious what they're doing and they've been caught, the United Nations has been caught over and over again adding hormones to vaccines to sterilize people.
[02:09:36.103 --> 02:09:44.444]  They've been caught over and over again carrying these type of things out.
[02:09:44.444 --> 02:09:52.886]  And then of course you have this article from the Mail Online, from the Sunday Mail, also the London Telegraph, BBC, only a few papers in the U.S.
[02:09:52.886 --> 02:09:54.246]  reported on this.
[02:09:54.246 --> 02:09:54.906]  That's a whole other
[02:09:55.814 --> 02:10:00.596]  Facet of this, shouldn't this be top news everywhere?
[02:10:00.596 --> 02:10:20.382]  That they knowingly are covering up the fact the flu shot is killing large numbers of people that it's tested on because of Gillian-Bernay syndrome, which is an autoimmune response basically in the brain and the brain shuts down and people stop breathing.
[02:10:21.690 --> 02:10:26.254]  And there's a whole bunch of brain disorders proven to be caused by vaccines.
[02:10:26.254 --> 02:10:30.599]  Swine flu jab link to killer nerve disease.
[02:10:30.599 --> 02:10:37.245]  Leaked letters reveals concern of neurologists over 25 deaths in America just in the test.
[02:10:37.245 --> 02:10:41.589]  A warning of the new swine flu jab is likely to be a deadly nerve disease.
[02:10:42.776 --> 02:10:48.058]  And has been linked to it, has been sent by the government to senior neurologist in a confidential letter.
[02:10:48.058 --> 02:10:49.058]  Let me read that again.
[02:10:49.058 --> 02:10:58.222]  A warning that the new swine flu jab is linked to a deadly nerve disease has been sent by the government to senior neurologist in a confidential letter.
[02:10:58.222 --> 02:11:06.065]  The letter from the Health Protection Agency, the official body that oversees public health, has been linked to the mail on Sunday.
[02:11:06.065 --> 02:11:06.906]  Has been leaked to them.
[02:11:11.693 --> 02:11:22.085]  Leading to demands to know why the information has not been given to the public before the vaccination of millions of people, including children, begins.
[02:11:22.085 --> 02:11:32.217]  Again, the letter, this is so important, I'm reading it twice, the letter from the Health Protection Agency, the official body that oversees the public health, has been leaked to the Mail on Sunday
[02:11:33.447 --> 02:11:43.075]  Leading to demands to know why the information has not been given to the public before the vaccination of millions of people, including children, begins.
[02:11:43.075 --> 02:11:54.844]  And they're trying to now condition the public that it's the law in Germany, in England, in the United States, in Canada, in Australia, all over the Western world, that you must take the shots.
[02:11:54.844 --> 02:11:57.186]  And it's being run by the World Health Organization.
[02:11:57.186 --> 02:11:58.347]  They picked the vaccine.
[02:11:58.347 --> 02:11:59.789]  They direct its use.
[02:11:59.789 --> 02:12:00.989]  They declared level six.
[02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:09.255]  The same UN that's been caught sterilizing people and putting HIV and vaccines and polio and vaccines on record.
[02:12:09.255 --> 02:12:15.980]  They were caught again last year and UN programs giving people polio shots are killing people again.
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:17.421]  You get the shot, you die from it.
[02:12:18.171 --> 02:12:19.552]  From polio.
[02:12:19.552 --> 02:12:23.855]  And the AP goes, well, you still need it even though it might kill you.
[02:12:23.855 --> 02:12:25.937]  And yeah, it's an accident.
[02:12:25.937 --> 02:12:28.419]  Yeah, Hitler accidentally had a mustache.
[02:12:28.419 --> 02:12:30.921]  Hitler accidentally wore black uniforms.
[02:12:30.921 --> 02:12:32.962]  Hitler accidentally was a Nazi.
[02:12:32.962 --> 02:12:35.304]  Birds accidentally fly.
[02:12:35.304 --> 02:12:37.266]  Ducks accidentally quack.
[02:12:37.266 --> 02:12:43.330]  I mean, I'm just sick of how they just calmly report, oh yeah, you know, over and over.
[02:12:43.330 --> 02:12:45.152]  I see this every few months, we're different.
[02:12:46.147 --> 02:12:49.968]  UN programs in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe.
[02:12:49.968 --> 02:12:51.548]  Give people the polio.
[02:12:51.548 --> 02:12:53.208]  Give people HIV.
[02:12:53.208 --> 02:12:54.929]  Give people bird flu.
[02:12:54.929 --> 02:12:57.229]  Give people Ebola.
[02:12:57.229 --> 02:13:00.190]  The Gardasil's killing masses of people.
[02:13:00.190 --> 02:13:02.270]  And it's like, yeah, it kills you.
[02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:05.311]  But usually you only have convulsions and get paralyzed.
[02:13:05.311 --> 02:13:10.072]  The women are like, good, I want my daughter to have it.
[02:13:10.072 --> 02:13:12.792]  We ought to pull up a Gardasil ad.
[02:13:12.792 --> 02:13:14.213]  My daughter's one less.
[02:13:14.213 --> 02:13:15.533]  Yeah, one less that's living.
[02:13:18.785 --> 02:13:30.029]  Now, there's Irish health, there's the Irish newspaper, swine flu vaccine warning to neurologists, but you won't see this in our newspapers because we're the brain damaged people that take whatever they're told.
[02:13:30.029 --> 02:13:32.990]  I mean, that's why the public, folks, when you're, look, I'm convinced.
[02:13:34.008 --> 02:13:36.410]  In the last 10 years, people are more brain damaged.
[02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:39.752]  I mean, I talk to adults now, and they can barely tie their shoes.
[02:13:39.752 --> 02:13:41.874]  They can't stay on task.
[02:13:41.874 --> 02:13:49.839]  I mean, is it that they're watching TV all day, or is it the government document how they wanted to sterilize us and dumb us down with chemicals in the water and vaccines?
[02:13:49.839 --> 02:13:50.600]  Eco-science.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:52.081]  No, they're doing it.
[02:13:52.081 --> 02:13:54.702]  I mean, look at everybody.
[02:13:54.702 --> 02:13:57.184]  Look what they've done to us.
[02:13:57.184 --> 02:13:59.566]  And the public's gonna go out and get it.
[02:13:59.566 --> 02:14:02.268]  That's why you got people who are 25 years old with Alzheimer's now.
[02:14:05.066 --> 02:14:13.428]  I mean, almost everybody I know that takes flu shots who's above 50 can't even hardly talk, they just kind of... I mean, literally, what?
[02:14:13.428 --> 02:14:15.028]  This is incredible!
[02:14:15.028 --> 02:14:17.809]  But they don't advertise it's dangerous so people don't know.
[02:14:17.809 --> 02:14:20.149]  Yeah, my neighbor's 40, he's got cancer.
[02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:22.830]  The kid down the street's 9, he's dying of cancer.
[02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:25.690]  Yeah, my daughter's got cancer.
[02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:31.372]  Here in my office, we have multiple people whose girlfriends and family members who are 21, 25, 30 years old are dying of cancer.
[02:14:35.171 --> 02:14:39.632]  I mean, it's just the way things are now, you know?
[02:14:39.632 --> 02:14:45.233]  Pretty soon the kids will say, Mommy, is it true kids didn't used to live in wheelchairs and have to be on drugs?
[02:14:45.233 --> 02:14:48.134]  No, that's a conspiracy theory, honey.
[02:14:48.134 --> 02:14:53.515]  Everyone's always been in a wheelchair and taking 14 injections a day and taking all these pills.
[02:14:53.515 --> 02:14:54.235]  THX1138.
[02:14:54.235 --> 02:14:57.336]  Everyone's always had injectors strapped onto their arms.
[02:14:57.336 --> 02:14:58.836]  In fact, where's that London Guardian?
[02:14:58.836 --> 02:15:01.397]  I kept meaning to get to that and Rob Dew came in with it.
[02:15:01.397 --> 02:15:02.377]  Here's the London Guardian.
[02:15:04.221 --> 02:15:09.984]  And I have the Wall Street Journal saying it's a mental illness to want to purify your water.
[02:15:09.984 --> 02:15:18.568]  Now folks, isn't that creepy when the establishment's telling you it's mentally ill to eat healthy and drink clean water?
[02:15:18.568 --> 02:15:20.889]  These people mean business, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:20.889 --> 02:15:23.030]  They mean real business.
[02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:25.712]  It's now mentally ill if you don't want to eat GMO.
[02:15:27.065 --> 02:15:28.586]  You're now mentally ill.
[02:15:28.586 --> 02:15:32.907]  I'll put it down here so you can get a screenshot for folks with the document cam.
[02:15:32.907 --> 02:15:37.169]  Healthy food obsession sparks rise in new eating disorder.
[02:15:37.169 --> 02:15:44.372]  You know, I've been eating a lot healthier the last six months and lost 37 pounds.
[02:15:44.372 --> 02:15:49.574]  Other than breaking out, something I hadn't done since I was a teenager, it's been great as all these toxins come out of me.
[02:15:49.574 --> 02:15:52.316]  I feel like I'm 18 again or something.
[02:15:54.465 --> 02:15:56.446]  I feel great though, so.
[02:15:56.446 --> 02:16:00.287]  It says, healthy food obsession sparks rise in new eating disorder.
[02:16:00.287 --> 02:16:07.489]  I'm mentally ill, because last night I just had an organic cheese sandwich and a salad.
[02:16:07.489 --> 02:16:17.652]  I'm mentally ill.
[02:16:17.652 --> 02:16:21.193]  They now have orthorexia.
[02:16:22.746 --> 02:16:23.907]  See, that's the new disease.
[02:16:23.907 --> 02:16:27.128]  If you want to eat healthy, you need to be put on drugs.
[02:16:27.128 --> 02:16:30.850]  You're mentally ill if you want to eat salads.
[02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:35.953]  They have all these new diseases where if you believe in a world government, you're mentally ill.
[02:16:35.953 --> 02:16:44.577]  Sufferers like to focus on righteous eating and have rigid rules about avoiding certain foods.
[02:16:44.577 --> 02:16:47.999]  Oh my gosh, they are bad people.
[02:16:50.322 --> 02:16:58.632]  Don't worry though, the priest class of the control freaks, they've got some deadly fluoride-based pills that actually eat holes in your brains.
[02:16:58.632 --> 02:17:00.414]  You eat this, you won't worry about nothing!
[02:17:01.564 --> 02:17:03.125]  Just take some pills!
[02:17:03.125 --> 02:17:10.733]  Are you like all the kids on Prozac and Ritalin with the brain shrinkage, the heart swelling, the heart palpitations, all the deaths?
[02:17:10.733 --> 02:17:11.413]  Absolutely!
[02:17:11.413 --> 02:17:24.345]  Read all those deadly chemicals, read the insert about all the things it does to you, and then, you're normal though if you want to eat those pills, but if you want to eat a salad, man, you're, you're, whoa dude, you're rad!
[02:17:24.345 --> 02:17:25.346]  You're radical!
[02:17:26.267 --> 02:17:30.768]  Oh man, dude, I know a dude that only eats organic food, man!
[02:17:30.768 --> 02:17:32.729]  He's, like, really dangerous!
[02:17:32.729 --> 02:17:34.149]  God, he's radical!
[02:17:34.149 --> 02:17:36.790]  You need to put him in the funny farm, yeah!
[02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:41.131]  He doesn't like eating GMO salmon with cockroach and human genes!
[02:17:41.131 --> 02:17:42.291]  Yeah!
[02:17:42.291 --> 02:17:43.912]  Yeah, man, he's weird!
[02:17:43.912 --> 02:17:45.232]  Dude, dude, dude, he's weird!
[02:17:46.482 --> 02:17:53.627]  They advertise all over the country with beef you can get delivered to your house and it says grass-fed beef and it's so weird.
[02:17:53.627 --> 02:17:55.968]  The media does pieces about how that's weird.
[02:17:55.968 --> 02:17:57.589]  Cows eating grass!
[02:17:58.766 --> 02:18:01.608]  Man, that's radical too, dude!
[02:18:01.608 --> 02:18:08.933]  What's normal is grinding up the dead cows and dead dogs and dead farm animals, but also your dog dies at the vet.
[02:18:08.933 --> 02:18:13.556]  You didn't know they sell it to a facility that's ground into dog food and other animal food?
[02:18:13.556 --> 02:18:18.299]  And they mix them all in, in these awful slurries is what they're called.
[02:18:18.299 --> 02:18:21.000]  That's what the term awful means, just the guts out of an animal.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.042]  And they grind it all up and they feed that to cows!
[02:18:24.042 --> 02:18:27.945]  Then they wonder why the cows get mad cow and start growing crystals in their
[02:18:28.445 --> 02:18:40.671]  In their tissue, in their bones, and in muscle that's anywhere near the spinal cord or other central bone structures.
[02:18:40.671 --> 02:18:46.374]  See, oh, there's weirdos who say we shouldn't feed rotten animals to cows.
[02:18:46.374 --> 02:18:47.974]  They're so radical.
[02:18:47.974 --> 02:18:50.776]  I mean, these people are dangerous.
[02:18:50.776 --> 02:18:52.837]  Of course cows are only supposed to eat meat.
[02:18:54.082 --> 02:18:55.967]  Rotten meat at that.
[02:18:55.967 --> 02:18:58.753]  Man, I'm glad I'm not one of these people that thinks you should eat healthy.
[02:18:58.753 --> 02:19:02.401]  I mean, and I'm glad I'm not one of these people that, uh...
[02:19:05.389 --> 02:19:06.750]  Oh, it's just so radical.
[02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:22.235]  See, the elite know there's revolution against them, because they got humanity so far down the line of accepting dehumanization and poison and vaccines and cancer viruses and all the things they do, that finally we got people to wake up from the trance.
[02:19:22.235 --> 02:19:29.297]  And more and more are waking up, and as other people wake up from the trance, it's accelerating, so they're coming out and using all the peer pressure they can.
[02:19:29.297 --> 02:19:31.398]  It's mentally ill to not want world government!
[02:19:31.898 --> 02:19:33.779]  It's mentally ill to not eat GMO food.
[02:19:33.779 --> 02:19:36.100]  It's mentally ill to drink filtered water.
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:36.800]  Don't do it!
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:39.682]  And people are going, I don't believe a word you say.
[02:19:39.682 --> 02:19:44.984]  And then they're reading, wait, you mean the flu shot's killing people that take it?
[02:19:44.984 --> 02:19:48.005]  You mean the government knew this and is doing it again?
[02:19:48.005 --> 02:19:49.426]  That's in the articles.
[02:19:49.426 --> 02:19:53.048]  You mean the government's putting polio in the polio shots?
[02:19:53.048 --> 02:19:58.390]  You mean the White House science czar said they wanted to do this decades ago and now they are?
[02:19:58.390 --> 02:19:59.751]  See, people are waking up.
[02:20:01.115 --> 02:20:06.118]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[02:20:09.548 --> 02:20:09.948]  I don't know.
[02:20:31.613 --> 02:20:31.973]  We're good.
[02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:03.823]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.823 --> 02:21:06.745]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:21:06.745 --> 02:21:15.353]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:21:15.353 --> 02:21:18.355]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:21:18.355 --> 02:21:22.258]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:21:22.258 --> 02:21:23.259]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:21:25.541 --> 02:21:26.602]  Take action now!
[02:21:26.602 --> 02:21:31.405]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:21:31.405 --> 02:21:35.387]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:21:35.387 --> 02:21:38.709]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:21:38.709 --> 02:21:45.153]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[02:21:45.453 --> 02:21:51.417]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:21:51.417 --> 02:21:53.739]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[02:21:53.739 --> 02:21:59.283]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:21:59.283 --> 02:22:02.545]  It is a big idea.
[02:22:02.545 --> 02:22:05.367]  A new world order.
[02:22:05.367 --> 02:22:09.710]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:22:10.242 --> 02:22:13.063]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:13.063 --> 02:22:15.864]  Put their objective be world domination.
[02:22:15.864 --> 02:22:19.025]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:22:19.025 --> 02:22:26.347]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:34.824]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:22:34.824 --> 02:22:38.706]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:22:38.706 --> 02:22:41.268]  The Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:22:41.268 --> 02:22:42.429]  Most people have no idea.
[02:22:42.429 --> 02:22:43.229]  They're not after money.
[02:22:43.229 --> 02:22:44.490]  They have all the money they need.
[02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:45.491]  They're after power.
[02:22:45.491 --> 02:22:46.632]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:22:55.317 --> 02:22:58.139]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:22:58.139 --> 02:22:59.260]  You have been warned.
[02:23:00.681 --> 02:23:06.204]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:23:06.204 --> 02:23:06.985]  and the world.
[02:23:06.985 --> 02:23:10.847]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:23:10.847 --> 02:23:17.352]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:23:17.352 --> 02:23:19.393]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:23:19.393 --> 02:23:27.338]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:23:27.598 --> 02:23:32.300]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:38.103]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:23:38.103 --> 02:23:40.283]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:23:40.283 --> 02:23:43.625]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[02:23:43.985 --> 02:23:44.305]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.

[02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:50.090]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:51.331]  Tex Mars is coming up in the next hour.
[02:23:51.331 --> 02:23:51.871]  Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[02:24:11.653 --> 02:24:14.134]  He is with us now for the next 35 minutes or so.
[02:24:14.134 --> 02:24:19.177]  We'll get him back up in the next few weeks for a full hour or two to take phone calls.
[02:24:19.177 --> 02:24:33.525]  He is a board-certified neurosurgeon, author and lecturer, attended LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans, and completed his general surgery internship and neurosurgical residency at the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:24:33.525 --> 02:24:35.786]  And he ran the neurosurgery program there.
[02:24:35.786 --> 02:24:37.247]  He is the inventor of some of the most
[02:24:39.164 --> 02:24:42.666]  Famous, modern forms of brain surgery.
[02:24:42.666 --> 02:24:43.747]  It's a very long bio.
[02:24:43.747 --> 02:24:47.190]  He's a top brain surgeon and neurologist.
[02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:50.532]  So not just in brain surgery, but also overall brain science.
[02:24:50.532 --> 02:24:53.174]  He's with us for the next 35 minutes.
[02:24:53.174 --> 02:24:57.677]  Doctor, you got on the line before we went to break and you were laughing during the break, saying, yeah, that's right.
[02:25:00.669 --> 02:25:03.610]  Don't filter your water and don't eat organic food.
[02:25:03.610 --> 02:25:06.991]  They're now, not just in the London Guardian, but all over U.S.
[02:25:06.991 --> 02:25:16.214]  television, saying it's mentally ill to not want to take your vaccines, to want to eat clean food, to want to filter your water.
[02:25:16.214 --> 02:25:19.575]  I mean, this is really getting crazy, Doctor.
[02:25:19.575 --> 02:25:24.437]  Well, they're obsessed with people, you know, avoiding these toxins.
[02:25:24.437 --> 02:25:29.659]  If the science on the toxicity of fluoridation of water just extended, even the
[02:25:31.405 --> 02:25:42.453]  National Academy of Sciences has completed a huge study which confirmed everything we've been saying in the research literature about toxicity of fluoride.
[02:25:42.453 --> 02:25:51.499]  And I wrote a paper along with Jekyll Sabachian, a scientist, which is a comprehensive review of the toxicity of fluoride.
[02:25:51.499 --> 02:25:53.820]  It collects all the research known on it.
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:57.343]  So, you know, the research is so extensive.
[02:25:58.992 --> 02:26:07.458]  It's ridiculous that we're still adding fluoride to water, plus the fact that they admit that it has nothing to do with reducing cavity.
[02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:14.464]  Even the American Dental Association had to admit that drinking fluoride in water does not reduce cavity for one bit.
[02:26:14.464 --> 02:26:15.484]  But they're still doing it.
[02:26:15.484 --> 02:26:19.227]  Well, you have to ask, why are you doing it then?
[02:26:19.227 --> 02:26:22.049]  So that leaves it open to a lot of interpretation of why they're doing it.
[02:26:22.049 --> 02:26:23.250]  Same thing with organic food.
[02:26:24.065 --> 02:26:24.405]  I don't know.
[02:26:43.789 --> 02:26:52.751]  So they didn't test the ring structures, the trace minerals, the cofactors, they didn't test the GMO alterations that are in the GMO.
[02:26:52.751 --> 02:26:55.092]  All of this is left out.
[02:26:55.092 --> 02:26:59.553]  And of course this is the way modern political science is done.
[02:26:59.553 --> 02:27:12.977]  If you work for government or you work for institutes that are promoting a program, they just manipulate the science, release it to the press, the press regurgitates it, and then all the true scientists out there are saying it's a bunch of baloney.
[02:27:13.759 --> 02:27:15.640]  They never get interviewed.
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:19.862]  Their material will never appear before the public eye.
[02:27:19.862 --> 02:27:21.222]  That's just the way they do things.
[02:27:21.222 --> 02:27:23.043]  Same thing with the vaccine.
[02:27:23.043 --> 02:27:27.525]  What we know about vaccines is so frightening that the public knew it.
[02:27:27.525 --> 02:27:31.267]  I don't think anyone would submit their child to be injected with these things.
[02:27:31.267 --> 02:27:36.209]  Well yes sir, this is a short segment and I want to come back in the next and just sit back and have you go over
[02:27:37.356 --> 02:27:44.157]  They keep accidentally, in quotes, putting live polio in the shots that are killing people all over the world.
[02:27:44.157 --> 02:28:00.441]  They keep, in quotes, accidentally, they say, oh yeah, the 76, and now this new flu, as you know, vaccine, is killing people with degenerative nerve diseases, and there's a whole family of those, which, for the listeners, so you can speak on that, but just briefly,
[02:28:01.321 --> 02:28:03.002]  I'm not on some elite high horse.
[02:28:03.002 --> 02:28:08.844]  I don't think of myself, Dr. Blaylock, as a brain surgeon like yourself, BlaylockReport.com.
[02:28:08.844 --> 02:28:11.546]  You know the old pun, he's as smart as a brain surgeon.
[02:28:11.546 --> 02:28:13.526]  I just have a good memory.
[02:28:13.526 --> 02:28:22.030]  And talking to the public, people around me, I went to a water park this weekend, the public looks like they've been poisoned.
[02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:26.632]  Kind of like if you look at cows and say, those cows don't look healthy.
[02:28:26.632 --> 02:28:30.094]  They look drugged out, they look, they act mentally retarded.
[02:28:31.975 --> 02:28:34.838]  And more, is it watching the TV?
[02:28:34.838 --> 02:28:53.776]  We know the studies show that a lot of TV watching can even lower the brainwaves over time, retard people's development, kind of put them into a zombie state, but you're the expert on this, but just as a medical doctor and observing people practicing for, what, 30 years, have you noticed that it seems like people are becoming mentally retarded?
[02:28:54.758 --> 02:29:07.747]  Well, what I have noticed, which I remarked to my office staff, I said, I can't believe the number of young people that are coming in to me saying they're having trouble with their memory.
[02:29:07.747 --> 02:29:15.292]  I said, you know, when I was growing up, I never heard a complaint that you had trouble with your memory.
[02:29:15.292 --> 02:29:18.954]  You know, when you were young, you could remember everybody's phone number, everybody's name.
[02:29:18.954 --> 02:29:21.356]  I could remember where every book in my library was.
[02:29:21.356 --> 02:29:22.957]  I could turn to any page.
[02:29:24.049 --> 02:29:32.074]  But more and more people are having difficulty with memory and cognitive functions that are very young.
[02:29:32.074 --> 02:29:35.276]  And so, yes, something is going on.
[02:29:35.276 --> 02:29:39.919]  And I think it's, you know, environmental influences.
[02:29:39.919 --> 02:29:40.919]  Environmental influences.
[02:29:40.919 --> 02:29:41.279]  Stay there.
[02:29:41.279 --> 02:29:42.200]  I want to talk more about that.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:45.602]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, BlaylockReport.com.
[02:29:45.602 --> 02:29:48.884]  We really are thankful to have him, this eminent scientist, on with us.
[02:29:51.809 --> 02:29:53.213]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.213 --> 02:29:55.739]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.739 --> 02:29:58.445]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.913 --> 02:30:05.154]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.154 --> 02:30:07.154]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.154 --> 02:30:15.676]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.676 --> 02:30:21.218]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.218 --> 02:30:22.838]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.078 --> 02:30:29.600]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:40.663]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.663 --> 02:30:41.123]  That's right.
[02:30:41.423 --> 02:30:43.985]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[02:31:00.794 --> 02:31:02.176]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.176 --> 02:31:04.178]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:31:04.178 --> 02:31:05.159]  Well, you should.
[02:31:05.159 --> 02:31:09.644]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:31:09.644 --> 02:31:10.465]  That's right.
[02:31:10.465 --> 02:31:19.114]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:31:19.114 --> 02:31:20.476]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:31:20.476 --> 02:31:21.617]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:31:21.817 --> 02:31:27.802]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:31:27.802 --> 02:31:34.707]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:31:34.707 --> 02:31:40.231]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:31:40.231 --> 02:31:41.672]  This is real.
[02:31:41.672 --> 02:31:42.733]  Don't miss out.

[02:31:57.347 --> 02:32:01.011]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:06.217]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:10.002]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:10.242 --> 02:32:10.923]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.923 --> 02:32:16.147]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:16.147 --> 02:32:16.788]  It's true.
[02:32:16.788 --> 02:32:21.212]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.212 --> 02:32:22.133]  Number 3.
[02:32:22.133 --> 02:32:27.758]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:32:27.758 --> 02:32:28.438]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.438 --> 02:32:31.341]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:32:31.341 --> 02:32:35.004]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.004 --> 02:32:35.225]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.845 --> 02:32:39.688]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.688 --> 02:32:45.412]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:32:45.412 --> 02:32:50.115]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.115 --> 02:32:51.896]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:54.458]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:11.184]  Okay, Dr. Russell Blaylock, brain surgeon, neuroscience expert, joining us right now.
[02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:34.262]  We were getting into, if people knew how deadly vaccines were, they would never take them.
[02:33:34.262 --> 02:33:36.343]  It does seem that's starting to come out.
[02:33:36.343 --> 02:33:48.828]  I'm sure, because I've seen you writing on it, for years you've talked about all these degenerative diseases of the brain associated with different things in the vaccines.
[02:33:48.828 --> 02:33:51.610]  Not just the one that's making headlines right now.
[02:33:53.595 --> 02:33:57.417]  That they're talking about, but a whole group of these.
[02:33:57.417 --> 02:34:04.480]  But for listeners that just now joined us, one of the headlines is, Swine Flu Jab Link to Killer Nerve Disease.
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:14.144]  Leaked letter reveals concerns of neurologists over 25 deaths in America just in the trials and how to keep this secret from the public.
[02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:22.348]  And then I have a whole other big stack, top virologist, a whole bunch of top brain scientists,
[02:34:23.607 --> 02:34:30.856]  Neurosurgeons are saying the same thing in Bild, the biggest newspaper in Germany.
[02:34:30.856 --> 02:34:34.601]  They're saying it has live cancer viruses in it.
[02:34:34.601 --> 02:34:38.225]  I mean, this is just wild stuff, but I want you to get into that, doctor.
[02:34:38.225 --> 02:34:40.488]  But first, finishing up, the break cut you off.
[02:34:42.108 --> 02:34:49.052]  Is the sluggishness, the additives, the vaccines, the chemicals in the water, is it a cocktail of those?
[02:34:49.052 --> 02:34:50.813]  Because, yeah, I guess retarded isn't the word.
[02:34:50.813 --> 02:34:54.755]  It's more of a sluggishness, almost a glazed over.
[02:34:54.755 --> 02:34:58.156]  Or is it a mix of watching four and a half hours of TV a day?
[02:34:58.156 --> 02:35:00.337]  We're a very passive population.
[02:35:00.337 --> 02:35:01.178]  I mean, what is it?
[02:35:01.178 --> 02:35:02.799]  Because I look at old black and white photos.
[02:35:02.799 --> 02:35:05.980]  I look at old family Super 8 video or
[02:35:07.321 --> 02:35:11.043]  You know, video or film shot 20, 30, 40 years ago in my family.
[02:35:11.043 --> 02:35:11.763]  They're alive.
[02:35:11.763 --> 02:35:13.764]  They look awake.
[02:35:13.764 --> 02:35:15.645]  I mean, it's not nostalgia.
[02:35:15.645 --> 02:35:17.946]  Something real is going on there.
[02:35:17.946 --> 02:35:22.068]  What is taking the spark out of people from your research?
[02:35:22.068 --> 02:35:30.472]  Well, I think if we look at it, and a lot of scientists are beginning to agree with this, is the number of environmental assaults on people.
[02:35:30.472 --> 02:35:35.574]  Things like fluoride in water, the heavy use of pesticides and herbicides,
[02:35:36.041 --> 02:35:37.402]  That's all in the atmosphere.
[02:35:37.402 --> 02:35:42.046]  You know, they study people, look at their fat content of these chemicals.
[02:35:42.046 --> 02:35:52.153]  They find something like 80 to 110 different organic chemicals from industry, and pesticides and herbicides in their tissues.
[02:35:52.153 --> 02:36:03.362]  All of the vaccinations, we give 40, 50, 60 vaccines by the time a child enters college, they're just being vaccinated to death.
[02:36:03.362 --> 02:36:04.843]  Well, I'd be rather intense
[02:36:05.822 --> 02:36:22.371]  Research in the literature, collecting all that's known from our research in the neuroscience of vaccination and what it does, well there's this compelling evidence that these vaccines, the way they're being given, is producing a state of chronic brain inflammation.
[02:36:22.371 --> 02:36:34.397]  And that when your brain is chronically inflamed, it produces depression, it produces disorientation, confusion, difficulty thinking clearly, clouded thinking in your mind, fatigue,
[02:36:35.844 --> 02:36:43.589]  Abnormal behavior, even violent behavior, criminal behavior, suicide, addictions, the list just goes on and on.
[02:36:43.589 --> 02:36:47.672]  And this is all well demonstrated in the scientific literature.
[02:36:47.672 --> 02:36:57.299]  The problem is it's never discussed because of the pressure and the power of those that are promoting these vaccines in our children.
[02:36:57.299 --> 02:37:02.283]  For instance, the average child is getting 36 vaccines by the time they start school.
[02:37:02.867 --> 02:37:07.849]  That is an enormous assault on the brain by this vaccine.
[02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:23.497]  And the process by which they do it, that is, phasing them every two months and giving five and six and seven vaccines at each office visit, produces an enormous activation of the brain's immune system in a prolonged way.
[02:37:23.497 --> 02:37:31.461]  And each segment of that vaccination process produces a real hyper-intense brain inflammation.
[02:37:31.894 --> 02:37:40.419]  That is, some children produce autism, some ADHD, some have seizures, some have other neurological dysfunctions.
[02:37:40.419 --> 02:37:49.005]  Well, this whole flu vaccine thing, they're planning on doing three serial vaccines within 21 days.
[02:37:49.005 --> 02:37:58.871]  Well, if you look at the neuroscience of that, that produces a rather significant prolonged brain inflammation, particularly with the adjuvant they're going to use.
[02:37:59.574 --> 02:38:12.301]  In fact, some of the best evidence was when they guinea-pigged a few years ago the anthrax shots to see what would happen with the troops in different levels and it killed quite a few of them.
[02:38:25.816 --> 02:38:34.101]  Well, it caused a 200% increase in ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease, which is a fatal disorder.
[02:38:34.101 --> 02:38:35.461]  So they finally admitted that.
[02:38:35.461 --> 02:38:37.743]  It took a long time to get them admitted.
[02:38:37.743 --> 02:38:47.568]  Several, I remember a Lieutenant Colonel testified before Congress, and he was in the middle stages of ALS and eventually died.
[02:38:47.568 --> 02:38:54.732]  It took a lot of pressure before they admitted, yes, the vaccine caused these soldiers to die from this horrible disease.
[02:38:55.786 --> 02:38:58.347]  Well, it's not the only disease that's neurological.
[02:38:58.347 --> 02:39:02.468]  There's Guillain-Barre Ascending Paralysis that you talked about.
[02:39:02.468 --> 02:39:15.032]  Well, in 1976, there were over 500 reported cases, but there were probably 10 or 100 times a greater number of cases that were never reported, because it's not a reportable disease.
[02:39:15.032 --> 02:39:17.673]  You don't have to report it.
[02:39:17.673 --> 02:39:21.654]  They had three elderly people died in one vaccination center, one day.
[02:39:22.601 --> 02:39:24.522]  After receiving the vaccine.
[02:39:24.522 --> 02:39:28.624]  And they're doing the same thing now they did back then, it's the bait and switch.
[02:39:28.624 --> 02:39:34.127]  They tested one vaccine, and then gave millions of people a different vaccine.
[02:39:34.127 --> 02:39:37.489]  That's exactly what they admit they're planning to do now.
[02:39:37.489 --> 02:39:42.292]  I have in Nature Magazine, an interview with the head of the U.S.
[02:39:42.292 --> 02:39:49.716]  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci of ACI, and they asked him a series of questions.
[02:39:49.716 --> 02:39:50.176]  One was,
[02:39:50.771 --> 02:39:52.931]  What are you going to do to test this vaccine?
[02:39:52.931 --> 02:39:56.152]  They said, well, we have five tests.
[02:39:56.152 --> 02:39:59.512]  And they said, well, are you going to put the adjuvant in the vaccine to test it?
[02:39:59.512 --> 02:40:00.653]  He said, no.
[02:40:00.653 --> 02:40:06.654]  We're going to test it without the adjuvant on children and pregnant women and other people.
[02:40:06.654 --> 02:40:13.215]  And then he said, well, are you going to use the adjuvantated vaccine when you actually give it to people?
[02:40:13.215 --> 02:40:14.615]  He said, yeah.
[02:40:14.615 --> 02:40:19.256]  So they're testing one vaccine and it's going to give a different vaccine.
[02:40:19.256 --> 02:40:20.156]  It's the adjuvant.
[02:40:20.683 --> 02:40:27.467]  The powerful immune stimulant that produces most of the complications that are associated with vaccination.
[02:40:27.467 --> 02:40:32.910]  And the next question, he said, are you going to test adjuvants in children?
[02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:41.275]  And he said, and I quote, I don't think anybody has really good data on adjuvants in children.
[02:40:41.275 --> 02:40:49.340]  And the decision that we will not give it, give the adjuvated flu vaccine to kids, we don't have time to collect substantial data.
[02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:56.535]  Now, it works during the test, but when the vaccine comes out, the children will get a vaccine with adjuvant in it.
[02:40:57.045 --> 02:41:16.361]  Now, Dr. Blaylock, just to interrupt you, talking to yourself and other scientists, other medical doctors, other brain surgeons and neurologists, more and more we're realizing that yes, mercury and aluminum are bad, do build up, do cause problems when it's directly put in the bloodstream.
[02:41:16.361 --> 02:41:22.927]  Different from eating fish and it goes through you and is bound to the other, you know, other things in the food, so most of it,
[02:41:24.591 --> 02:41:25.193]  Leaves the body.
[02:41:33.121 --> 02:41:56.830]  Mercury overall is somewhat of a red herring, that it's really the autoimmune inflammation, not just in the brain, but even in other organs that's being associated with burning out the pancreas, attacking the liver, attacking the stomach walls, the intestinal walls, the brain, I mean, just basically the whole body.
[02:41:56.830 --> 02:42:02.612]  Well, you know, all of this has been proven, and we know that mercury, even in infinitesimally small doses,
[02:42:03.502 --> 02:42:11.065]  Powerfully increases brain inflammation, aggravates the brain's immune system, which is destructive of brain connection.
[02:42:11.065 --> 02:42:13.606]  Oh, so mercury is the adjuvant?
[02:42:13.606 --> 02:42:16.548]  Okay, so I always thought that mercury was the preservative, okay.
[02:42:16.548 --> 02:42:21.850]  Well, it is the preservative, but it also produces a high influence of autoimmunity.
[02:42:21.850 --> 02:42:26.552]  See, they never mention that mercury does this, but they talk about it.
[02:42:26.552 --> 02:42:30.654]  But it's well demonstrated, there's no question, I mean, it's accepted.
[02:42:31.246 --> 02:42:37.470]  That in infinitesimally small doses it produces significant brain disruption.
[02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:40.693]  It collects in the brain and stays there a lifetime.
[02:42:40.693 --> 02:42:48.078]  For instance, a child in the past was given 36 vaccines, most of which contained mercury.
[02:42:48.078 --> 02:42:52.181]  Each one of those doses accumulated in the brain for a lifetime.
[02:42:52.181 --> 02:42:58.565]  Plus, whatever they ate, whatever they breathed in the air, whatever was in their food was added to it.
[02:42:58.565 --> 02:42:59.786]  This was totally ignored.
[02:43:00.194 --> 02:43:08.918]  All of this stuff you hear about, well, we proved that mercury has no relation to disease, is an absolute lie and they know it.
[02:43:08.918 --> 02:43:10.619]  It's in the scientific literature.
[02:43:10.619 --> 02:43:11.359]  I write about it.
[02:43:11.359 --> 02:43:14.280]  It's in my articles on my website.
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:17.162]  I've published a number of articles on this.
[02:43:17.162 --> 02:43:19.203]  All the references are there.
[02:43:19.203 --> 02:43:19.843]  So they know it.
[02:43:20.810 --> 02:43:22.752]  They know all of these things.
[02:43:22.752 --> 02:43:35.580]  Well Doctor, let me ask you a layman's question and then go in other directions about this upcoming shot and what this Gillian Bernays is compared to the ALS and the other things you were talking about.
[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:45.746]  And all these new neurodegenerative diseases that I guess give the brain doctors a lot of work but is really being generated by this and other environmental factors that you were discussing.
[02:43:46.767 --> 02:44:01.096]  When you've engaged in brain surgeries, when you've done slides of tissue or biopsies, I've seen, just as a layman in medical journals, the incredible heavy metal plaques, the other plaques that are involved.
[02:44:01.956 --> 02:44:13.182]  Can you ever even, say, in an older person's brain that's had a large diet of heavy metals or worked in toxic factories or had a lot of shots, can you even see that in slides with the naked eye?
[02:44:13.182 --> 02:44:18.025]  Or what does it look like under a magnifying glass or under a microscope?
[02:44:18.025 --> 02:44:22.748]  Well, you don't see the metals directly, but you see the results of the metal.
[02:44:22.748 --> 02:44:26.590]  And of course, they carefully measure these metal contents at the different
[02:44:27.513 --> 02:44:37.921]  There's a significant elevation of mercury in the parts of the brain affected in Alzheimer's patients.
[02:44:37.921 --> 02:44:44.326]  They also have higher blood mercury levels than the population without the disorder.
[02:44:44.326 --> 02:44:47.849]  So most of these things have been carefully confirmed and measured.
[02:44:47.849 --> 02:44:54.514]  The aluminum content of the brain has been measured and what aluminum does in the brain has been demonstrated quite significantly.
[02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:59.433]  Yes, you can see the pathology in the brain produced by this.
[02:44:59.433 --> 02:45:10.061]  In fact, they even radio-labeled the aluminum in vaccines and traced it going from the site of the injection of the muscle into the brain.
[02:45:10.061 --> 02:45:14.524]  So we know that the aluminum from the vaccine ends up in the brain.
[02:45:14.524 --> 02:45:15.845]  So you can't argue about that.
[02:45:15.845 --> 02:45:24.212]  That's in the pump med medical journals and it's quite well demonstrated.
[02:45:25.124 --> 02:45:29.526]  So, you know, the evidence is there in just enormous amounts.
[02:45:29.526 --> 02:45:33.367]  It's just being ignored, and the media is in a state of confusion.
[02:45:33.367 --> 02:45:41.429]  They're listening to the people who are selling this stuff, and they won't listen to those of us who have researched it carefully.
[02:45:41.429 --> 02:45:51.973]  Now, about your neurological diseases, I will wager, if they do what they're planning on doing, you will see tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of cases
[02:45:52.535 --> 02:45:53.396]  I don't know.
[02:46:16.704 --> 02:46:18.305]  That's the beginning of his answer.
[02:46:18.305 --> 02:46:19.646]  We don't know what it'll do.
[02:46:19.646 --> 02:46:24.748]  We don't know what happens when you combine vaccines with different viruses in it.
[02:46:24.748 --> 02:46:26.669]  Well, the virologists know.
[02:46:26.669 --> 02:46:30.611]  The viruses start exchanging their genetics.
[02:46:30.611 --> 02:46:31.672]  They develop hybrids.
[02:46:31.672 --> 02:46:37.155]  They develop new viruses that produce new diseases.
[02:46:37.155 --> 02:46:38.735]  So he's lying.
[02:46:38.735 --> 02:46:41.297]  And all of this nonsense, well, oh, you know, the big
[02:46:42.444 --> 02:46:43.524]  A scare is coming.
[02:46:43.524 --> 02:46:45.625]  Of course, there's not many people dead in the world.
[02:46:45.625 --> 02:46:48.065]  It's been a pretty mild flu.
[02:46:48.065 --> 02:46:53.067]  They asked him, well, if the virus is mutating, what good will the vaccine do?
[02:46:53.067 --> 02:46:58.208]  And he says, oh, we've been checking the molecular and genetic makeup of these viruses all over the world.
[02:46:58.208 --> 02:47:00.769]  It has not changed one bit.
[02:47:00.769 --> 02:47:01.909]  That is a complete lie.
[02:47:01.909 --> 02:47:10.091]  I mean, it's all over the news that a month ago, in one week, there were five new mutations at one lab just in Houston.
[02:47:10.091 --> 02:47:10.251]  Sir,
[02:47:11.328 --> 02:47:16.971]  Clearly you went over the medical journals and the facts, Dr. Blaylock, that they know what all this is doing.
[02:47:16.971 --> 02:47:32.479]  When we look at Paul Ehrlich and John P. Holdren, both presidential advisors, one of them, the head science czar for those out there just now tuning in, they openly say sterilize people through the vaccines, sterilize them through the water.
[02:47:32.479 --> 02:47:39.563]  Other UN documents, like their biological diversity assessment, say use chemicals to brain damage the public.
[02:47:40.403 --> 02:47:52.094]  Nobel Prize winners that we've quoted and covered in my film in-game, like Bertrand Russell said, we will inject the public with heavy metals and brain damage the lower classes to be our servants.
[02:47:52.094 --> 02:48:04.506]  As a brain surgeon, as a neurologist, looking at this, knowing they're lying, knowing they know that one shot of the flu vaccine, what the reports are, three flu shots, doubles your chances of Alzheimer's in the studies.
[02:48:05.086 --> 02:48:09.370]  So if they know what they're doing then, the question is why are they doing it?
[02:48:09.370 --> 02:48:13.713]  Is this part of the larger Brave New World, Dr. Blaylock?
[02:48:13.713 --> 02:48:19.758]  Well, they're planning on giving the vaccine to 4.9 billion people worldwide.
[02:48:19.758 --> 02:48:28.566]  They have been caught in the past giving vaccines that were specifically designed to produce infertility in African women.
[02:48:28.566 --> 02:48:31.028]  The women caught on wouldn't take the vaccine.
[02:48:31.028 --> 02:48:32.369]  They tested the vaccine.
[02:48:32.961 --> 02:48:40.624]  And found out they had put anti-trophoblastic antigen in it with a specific goal of producing infertility.
[02:48:40.624 --> 02:48:45.266]  So, they have been caught using a tetanus vaccine.
[02:48:45.266 --> 02:48:49.408]  They also used it in Central America to do that one thing.
[02:48:49.408 --> 02:48:52.830]  It produced infertility for population control.
[02:48:52.830 --> 02:49:00.213]  If you read the literature going back all the way to 1910, this has been an obsession with the Rockefeller Carnegie Group.
[02:49:00.831 --> 02:49:06.555]  It's control of population growth and to reduce the population of the world.
[02:49:06.555 --> 02:49:12.159]  Who was the great funder of molecular science throughout history and all the way up to the present day?
[02:49:12.159 --> 02:49:17.463]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Carnegie Foundation, and now the Ford Foundation.
[02:49:17.463 --> 02:49:28.330]  So you have major foundations worth hundreds of billions of dollars that have been pouring their money into the science with that goal in mind, their eugenicists.
[02:49:29.053 --> 02:49:42.583]  And as I said in one of your other programs, if you read Lily Kay's book on the history of molecular science, she specifically says that was always their goal, social engineering and controlled population.
[02:49:42.583 --> 02:49:51.509]  So I'm not surprised that they would use the vaccine on 4.9 billion people worldwide with that goal in mind.
[02:49:52.247 --> 02:49:53.087]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:49:53.087 --> 02:50:01.509]  It's this specific vaccine already causing deaths in the trials, with secret memorandums in the federal government to keep that secret.
[02:50:01.509 --> 02:50:10.730]  I would say this is the most suspect vaccine, because they've been caught in the past adding these sterilants and other things to the larger programs.
[02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:14.571]  That just makes sense, if you're coming from their perspective.
[02:50:14.571 --> 02:50:16.411]  Well, absolutely.
[02:50:16.411 --> 02:50:18.412]  You know, and a lot of people are catching on.
[02:50:18.412 --> 02:50:20.472]  A third of the nurses in Britain
[02:50:20.956 --> 02:50:23.337]  They won't take the vaccine.
[02:50:23.337 --> 02:50:26.638]  More and more people are concerned about this.
[02:50:26.638 --> 02:50:36.803]  We haven't even covered some of the major things like the contamination with cancer-causing viruses, unknown viruses, neurotrophic cell viruses.
[02:50:36.803 --> 02:50:46.267]  All of this is talked about in the closed meeting among virologists, but the general public has no clue as to the occurrence of all of this.
[02:50:48.171 --> 02:50:50.732]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, final segment with you straight ahead.
[02:50:50.732 --> 02:50:54.073]  We'll get you on for an extended interview in the next few weeks.
[02:50:54.073 --> 02:51:01.776]  This information couldn't be more important.
[02:51:01.776 --> 02:51:06.057]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:51:06.057 --> 02:51:09.338]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:51:09.338 --> 02:51:17.121]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we, the people,
[02:51:17.381 --> 02:51:19.624]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[02:51:19.624 --> 02:51:22.006]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:51:22.006 --> 02:51:28.814]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:51:28.814 --> 02:51:35.020]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:51:35.020 --> 02:51:37.183]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:51:37.583 --> 02:51:45.351]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market, and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[02:52:01.678 --> 02:52:07.700]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:13.601]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:13.601 --> 02:52:19.743]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:20.103 --> 02:52:22.044]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:22.044 --> 02:52:24.524]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:24.524 --> 02:52:37.708]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.708 --> 02:52:39.369]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.369 --> 02:52:41.229]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.229 --> 02:52:47.471]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.398 --> 02:52:57.979]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:57.979 --> 02:53:01.221]  The people strike back.

[02:54:05.478 --> 02:54:06.959]  We are back live.
[02:54:06.959 --> 02:54:09.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:54:09.820 --> 02:54:14.482]  My film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, covers their eugenics master plan.
[02:54:14.482 --> 02:54:21.484]  You're hearing Dr. Blaylock, famous brain surgeon, researcher, neurologist, here telling you the same information.
[02:54:21.484 --> 02:54:23.685]  There is nothing more important than this info.
[02:54:23.685 --> 02:54:26.306]  We're going to get him on for a long interview in the next two weeks.
[02:54:26.846 --> 02:54:28.127]  Really honored to have him on with us.
[02:54:28.127 --> 02:54:30.809]  The website is BlaylockReport.com.
[02:54:30.809 --> 02:54:34.332]  B-L-A-Y-L-O-C-K-Report.com.
[02:54:34.332 --> 02:54:44.960]  A lot of friends and family won't listen to you, or me, or when we give them medical reports, or when you give them German news and British news about how it's killing people and full of cancer viruses.
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:56.269]  But, if they see a YouTube video of this interview, or you send them one of his books or articles or materials from BlaylockReport.com, you may save a life.
[02:54:56.940 --> 02:55:04.984]  You know, I was talking to a friend the other day about, he told this guy, you know, don't give your kid those shots, third round of shots, his son's brain damaged now, doesn't talk.
[02:55:04.984 --> 02:55:07.525]  This is a holocaust, it's by design.
[02:55:07.525 --> 02:55:10.246]  We got three and a half minutes left, Dr. Blaylock.
[02:55:10.246 --> 02:55:19.210]  In closing, they're talking about martial law, forced inoculations, the Governor's Association has sent a letter saying, we don't want to be under DOD control.
[02:55:19.210 --> 02:55:24.393]  They're announcing 400,000 troops to now occupy, that's the Hill newspaper, NAP.
[02:55:25.533 --> 02:55:31.374]  And then, as you said, the cancer viruses, all the other areas, I mean, this is insane!
[02:55:31.374 --> 02:55:33.855]  Your comments on that?
[02:55:33.855 --> 02:55:51.538]  Well, yeah, I mean, according to the World Health Organization, we come under IHR 2500, which says that they have the legal right to control the response to public health emergencies in the United States of America.
[02:55:52.284 --> 02:56:04.092]  So we are a signatory to that, and therefore they have the right to carry out any measures they want, and to recommend to our government what measures need to be taken on a state level.
[02:56:04.092 --> 02:56:07.475]  Well, all the plans have been worked out, as you say.
[02:56:07.475 --> 02:56:16.461]  They're using the excuse of the troops and the response of the military as to control riots of people who want to get the vaccine.
[02:56:17.557 --> 02:56:25.622]  What I thought was rather humorous rather than being the other way around is people who don't want to get it.
[02:56:25.622 --> 02:56:26.263]  Well said.
[02:56:26.263 --> 02:56:31.126]  What about the cancer virus angle?
[02:56:31.126 --> 02:56:32.027]  Go ahead.
[02:56:32.027 --> 02:56:44.235]  Well yeah, there's Dr. Martin who is a virologist and does a lot of research in this area and he's discovered what is stealth viruses which is now a lot of research around the world on stealth viruses.
[02:56:45.366 --> 02:56:48.407]  These are viruses that are not picked up by routine testing.
[02:56:48.407 --> 02:56:53.428]  It takes very meticulous testing to demonstrate it.
[02:56:53.428 --> 02:57:04.230]  But these vaccines are filled with stealth viruses that can produce brain disorders decades after you've been injected, or cancer.
[02:57:04.230 --> 02:57:09.471]  There's cancer-causing viruses that are known inside of these vaccines.
[02:57:09.471 --> 02:57:12.572]  Many of these viruses aren't even tested for.
[02:57:12.572 --> 02:57:13.932]  And they allow Norvartis,
[02:57:14.428 --> 02:57:17.569]  Do you think the establishment is going to get away with this?
[02:57:17.569 --> 02:57:22.430]  I mean, as you said earlier, it looks like people everywhere are waking up.
[02:57:22.430 --> 02:57:24.531]  But these eugenicists are just so bold.
[02:57:40.441 --> 02:57:53.177]  Well they are, but you know with the town hall meetings, they've seen how the public can react against these things, and I think it'll take a reaction like that to bring this to a halt.
[02:57:53.177 --> 02:57:57.462]  Once people understand that the vaccine is the big danger, not the flu.
[02:57:58.857 --> 02:58:07.844]  Well, Congressman Brown, Congressman Paul, former Congressman Dick Armey are all saying in major newspapers that they may use this for martial law.
[02:58:07.844 --> 02:58:12.749]  So it's not just Dr. Russell Blaylock or Alex Jones or us saying this from the wilderness.
[02:58:12.749 --> 02:58:15.070]  The good news is people are waking up.
[02:58:15.070 --> 02:58:23.457]  So maybe this push to make us take shots is an attempt to really try to force us to
[02:58:24.676 --> 02:58:27.737]  Go along with what they're doing and try to put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:58:27.737 --> 02:58:29.378]  But I don't think that's gonna happen.
[02:58:29.378 --> 02:58:32.499]  Dr. Blaylock, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:58:32.499 --> 02:58:34.340]  It's BlaylockReport.com.
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:35.680]  God bless you, sir.
[02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:36.140]  Thank you.
[02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:37.121]  God bless you.
[02:58:37.121 --> 02:58:37.521]  You bet.
[02:58:37.521 --> 02:58:39.101]  We'll have him back in two weeks.
[02:58:39.101 --> 02:58:42.763]  Tex Marr, straight ahead.
[02:58:42.763 --> 02:58:46.344]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.344 --> 02:58:48.385]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.684 --> 02:58:54.686]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.686 --> 02:59:00.031]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.031 --> 02:59:02.072]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.072 --> 02:59:07.076]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.076 --> 02:59:07.997]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.257 --> 02:59:09.378]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.378 --> 02:59:11.259]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.259 --> 02:59:12.340]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.340 --> 02:59:14.542]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.542 --> 02:59:15.863]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.863 --> 02:59:17.404]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.404 --> 02:59:22.668]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.668 --> 02:59:26.251]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.251 --> 02:59:29.734]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.074 --> 02:59:31.295]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.295 --> 02:59:32.195]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.195 --> 02:59:33.296]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.296 --> 02:59:34.237]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.237 --> 02:59:35.337]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.337 --> 02:59:38.379]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.379 --> 02:59:38.900]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:40.581]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.581 --> 02:59:41.581]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.581 --> 02:59:42.782]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.782 --> 02:59:44.623]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:22.012 --> 03:00:26.135]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:00:26.135 --> 03:00:31.478]  He is a number one national Christian bestseller.
[03:00:31.478 --> 03:00:33.960]  He's also had his books on the New York Times bestseller list.
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:40.324]  You know, Air Force officer, professor of space and aeronautics and military science.
[03:00:41.634 --> 03:00:43.475]  He's also a pastor.
[03:00:43.475 --> 03:00:47.956]  We carry a lot of his books and videos and materials at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:47.956 --> 03:00:50.397]  He's with us for the next 30-40 minutes or so.
[03:00:50.397 --> 03:00:55.899]  Then I'm going to finish up on a bunch of news and video clips I haven't gotten to yet.
[03:00:55.899 --> 03:01:08.164]  I wanted to get Tex on on short notice and I appreciate him doing it because we've covered how Tony Blair, according to major British newspapers, is possessed by the spirit of the light.
[03:01:09.474 --> 03:01:30.311]  and falls on the ground every morning and and sherry blair is his wife that is a witch and and they go to aztec rituals and different rituals and francois meter on paid to have the six hundred and sixty six pieces of gold glass at the pyramid at the louvre in paris and texas uh... has this uh...
[03:01:31.892 --> 03:01:40.397]  Big book, well he has two big books, Codex Magicka, and then he has these mysterious monuments, big textbook size books that we carry that we've covered.
[03:01:40.397 --> 03:01:42.618]  In fact, grab me one of those, I forgot to do it.
[03:01:42.618 --> 03:01:51.223]  It's just filled with politicians and sports teams, owners and bankers, admittedly building occult palaces, admittedly being into the occult.
[03:01:51.223 --> 03:01:58.027]  Ronald Reagan into the occult, wouldn't make a decision unless his astrologer said, gave speeches to the minute according to astrology.
[03:01:59.346 --> 03:02:11.029]  Hillary Clinton doing seances with Mrs. Roosevelt, having shaman Bohemian Grove in the occultism, skull and bones in the occultism.
[03:02:12.375 --> 03:02:28.661]  It just comes out Obama and all these weird shaman charms in his pocket and then it comes out witchcraft in the White House Town Hall with sources and documents and books coming out about it and then we have an article voodoo in the White House that goes into more detail.
[03:02:28.661 --> 03:02:31.262]  We're about to go to break but I wanted to go to text right now.
[03:02:31.262 --> 03:02:31.882]  Text!
[03:02:31.882 --> 03:02:36.224]  I mean everybody's freaking out about this but isn't this par for the course?
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.941]  Hey Alex, great to be with you again.
[03:02:38.941 --> 03:02:40.983]  Yes, it is poor for the course.
[03:02:40.983 --> 03:02:52.391]  Of course, during the Clinton White House, you mentioned Hillary Rodham Clinton, who went on top of the roof and actually invoked the spirits of the sky to come in to the White House.
[03:02:52.391 --> 03:02:58.375]  She was up there with a New Age shaman witch named Jean Houston.
[03:02:59.673 --> 03:03:11.759]  Who was her guru, and that, you know, Hillary also spoke by her own admission to both the spirit of Mohammed Gandhi and to Eleanor Roosevelt.
[03:03:11.759 --> 03:03:19.283]  But now, the Obamas, it's very hard to find direct connection with Barack.
[03:03:19.283 --> 03:03:26.407]  His wife has a little bit of this from her mother, but I'll tell you, you know, I just finished a new video about Obama myself.
[03:03:27.390 --> 03:03:45.667]  And I was able to find some amazing things and maybe when we come back I'll be glad to reveal these African tribal religion and then you know about this group Code Pink which is a
[03:03:46.519 --> 03:03:54.808]  Supposedly an anti-war group, but it turns out it's really a witchcraft, a Wicca group that's a big supporter of Obama.
[03:03:54.808 --> 03:04:03.978]  And in fact, they actually held a witchcraft ritual to cleanse the White House.
[03:04:04.804 --> 03:04:11.811]  of bad spirits and omens on the last day of George Bush in office.
[03:04:11.811 --> 03:04:23.742]  When you use witches to have a ritual to cleanse the White House, well, I wonder who they actually invited in to the White House.
[03:04:23.742 --> 03:04:28.426]  But that was Code Pink, a very interesting group.
[03:04:29.451 --> 03:04:43.492]  That is known supposedly for being its anti-war activity, but in fact, it seems like they're being very quiet, almost mute about Obama's intensification of the war.
[03:04:44.554 --> 03:04:45.835]  Tex Marr, stay with us.
[03:04:45.835 --> 03:04:48.416]  You're an expert in the occult and in these societies.
[03:04:48.416 --> 03:04:49.717]  One of the leading experts out there.
[03:04:49.717 --> 03:04:53.538]  In fact, he's in our film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[03:04:53.538 --> 03:04:55.439]  I made a new film called The Order of Death.
[03:04:55.439 --> 03:04:57.741]  They're both on the same DVD.
[03:04:57.741 --> 03:05:00.202]  And I'll tell you why I bring that up when we come back.
[03:05:01.052 --> 03:05:05.276]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:05:05.276 --> 03:05:07.298]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:05:07.298 --> 03:05:15.807]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:05:15.807 --> 03:05:21.372]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:05:21.372 --> 03:05:22.994]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:05:23.214 --> 03:05:29.736]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[03:05:40.779 --> 03:05:41.239]  That's right.

[03:06:00.973 --> 03:06:06.280]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.280 --> 03:06:10.806]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.806 --> 03:06:13.089]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:13.089 --> 03:06:14.711]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.711 --> 03:06:15.733]  There is a solution.

[03:08:02.020 --> 03:08:04.790]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:07.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.106 --> 03:08:23.807]  Tex Mars is our guest.
[03:08:23.807 --> 03:08:35.672]  The reason I brought up in the last segment, The Order of the Dead, the 45-minute film that's on the same DVD with the two-hour film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, that Tex is in.
[03:08:35.672 --> 03:08:46.216]  A few years after I snuck into Bohemian Grove with Mike Hanson, back in 2000, our camera guy, Ed Holman, was already out there visiting family in California.
[03:08:46.216 --> 03:08:48.858]  He drove up and there was the
[03:08:50.475 --> 03:08:54.127]  Bohemian Grove Action Network, a local peace group.
[03:08:55.404 --> 03:09:04.772]  Who had criticized me in the newspaper saying there's nothing occult at the Grove, there's no occultism, Alex is a kook, there is nothing, you know, none of this is real.
[03:09:04.772 --> 03:09:07.194]  This was the group protesting the Grove.
[03:09:07.194 --> 03:09:19.745]  And it turned out they had a witch's cauldron out, were doing chants, like Luke Skywalker, believe they were firing force beams in, going, oh, power beam, power beam, you know, like a cartoon.
[03:09:20.726 --> 03:09:22.628]  And it's the same thing Tex was just talking about.
[03:09:22.628 --> 03:09:28.172]  You have this big anti-war group that supports Obama, but really it turns out it's a voodoo group.
[03:09:28.172 --> 03:09:31.435]  And that's what Santa Maria is, is a white magic variant of that.
[03:09:31.435 --> 03:09:37.279]  So going back to Tex Mars, the headline at Infowars.com, voodoo in the White House.
[03:09:37.279 --> 03:09:40.982]  And it turns out Obama is very, very scared of this.
[03:09:40.982 --> 03:09:43.845]  But again, Obama shouldn't just be singled out.
[03:09:45.245 --> 03:09:47.106]  I'm sure they'll say voodoo is the new n-word.
[03:09:47.106 --> 03:09:51.068]  You're not allowed to criticize voodoo or you don't like Obama.
[03:09:51.068 --> 03:09:53.068]  But Tex, please continue.
[03:09:53.068 --> 03:09:56.890]  Well, you know, you mentioned this group Code Pink.
[03:09:56.890 --> 03:10:07.774]  And what we have to understand about this group, this is a group that could possibly show up when folks like We Are Change, who are pretty good people, are out there and attempt
[03:10:08.674 --> 03:10:11.095]  Uh, to sort of play off of that.
[03:10:11.095 --> 03:10:14.477]  Uh, but let's look at the group, okay?
[03:10:14.477 --> 03:10:25.122]  First of all, I want people to understand that this is not some odd group in terms of the Obama White House, because in The Nation magazine, you know, The Nation is one of the more liberal magazines.
[03:10:25.122 --> 03:10:29.785]  It's been on bookstores, uh, you know, Barnes & Noble and Borders, uh,
[03:10:30.913 --> 03:10:34.634]  Bookstore shelves for, you know, years, decades and decades.
[03:10:34.634 --> 03:10:40.976]  So this is an old-line, liberal, left-wing, Democrat Party publication.
[03:10:40.976 --> 03:10:58.380]  Now, Victor Nabofsky, who writes for The Nation on January the 20th, actually reported the fact that only, you know, when Obama was to be inaugurated, he invited his top campaign people
[03:10:59.232 --> 03:10:59.792]  Do you?
[03:11:15.445 --> 03:11:22.070]  Uh, for a rally to cleanse the White House for a Wiccan ritual by this Code Pink.
[03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:37.200]  Well, Alex, obviously I was very interested in finding out who is this Code Pink that is such a powerful group that its leaders are asked to ride on the campaign train with Obama and they're going to have this ritual to cleanse the White House.
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:41.262]  Well, I found three very interesting people who are the founders of it.
[03:11:41.262 --> 03:11:45.085]  The first one is the well-known witch, Miriam Starhawk.
[03:11:45.905 --> 03:11:53.809]  Uh, you know, my wife, Wanda, wrote the book, New Age Lies to Women, that exposed witchcraft in the Christian church, even.
[03:11:53.809 --> 03:11:56.830]  Starhawk is one of the people that she exposed.
[03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:59.271]  This Earth witchcraft Wicca activism.
[03:12:00.055 --> 03:12:06.317]  Uh, so Starhawk, and by the way that's not her real name, she's actually a Jewish woman named Miriam Simos.
[03:12:06.317 --> 03:12:09.698]  These are three Zionist Jewish women.
[03:12:09.698 --> 03:12:11.698]  Now this is what makes it interesting.
[03:12:11.698 --> 03:12:13.659]  They claim to be anti-war.
[03:12:13.659 --> 03:12:15.919]  They all are big backers of Obama.
[03:12:15.919 --> 03:12:18.980]  Uh, and they actually
[03:12:19.775 --> 03:12:20.235]  We're good to go.
[03:12:39.563 --> 03:12:47.848]  Janine Garofalo, Nancy Pelosi, Arianna Huffington, all of these people wrote in this Code Pink book.
[03:12:47.848 --> 03:12:52.130]  So you can see the power level of this group.
[03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:55.352]  Now the other two members are a woman named Jody Evans.
[03:12:55.352 --> 03:12:59.734]  Evidently she held this witchcraft literal to cleanse the White House.
[03:12:59.734 --> 03:13:01.255]  She went down to El Salvador.
[03:13:01.255 --> 03:13:03.176]  All of these are communists, socialists.
[03:13:03.176 --> 03:13:04.797]  She went down to El Salvador
[03:13:05.897 --> 03:13:08.518]  Uh, to work with the Zapatistas.
[03:13:08.518 --> 03:13:16.000]  Her husband was a wealthy, although most of these women are lesbian, uh, she went down, she had a wealthy, uh, billionaire husband.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:23.362]  By the way, they're a big supporter of the LGBT, you know, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender agenda.
[03:13:23.362 --> 03:13:30.104]  And they're, they were very happy, I understand, yesterday, because, uh, President Obama and Eric Holder, the Attorney General,
[03:13:31.130 --> 03:13:34.371]  Uh, came out against the Defense of Marriage Act.
[03:13:34.371 --> 03:13:35.472]  They want it repealed.
[03:13:35.472 --> 03:13:40.193]  Uh, and that pleased the, uh, the lesbians and the, uh, transgender people.
[03:13:40.193 --> 03:13:51.757]  Uh, but the big thing about Code Pink, being a socialist communist, being part of the Obama campaign, uh, funding network, is that they are for a global government.
[03:13:51.757 --> 03:13:55.038]  In other words, the New World Order and a, and culture.
[03:13:55.038 --> 03:13:56.659]  But now get this, Alex.
[03:13:56.659 --> 03:13:57.959]  You know, there's a law right now.
[03:13:57.959 --> 03:13:58.600]  If you were to send $50
[03:14:00.191 --> 03:14:07.715]  To some, you know, Arab group that they claim is Al-Qaeda, they'd put you in prison, would they not?
[03:14:07.715 --> 03:14:08.776]  Absolutely.
[03:14:08.776 --> 03:14:26.725]  Yeah, but wait, this group, Code Pink, gave $600,000 in food and medicine and cash to the Iraqi insurgents that were fighting the Americans, and this whole deal for them to give this money
[03:14:27.972 --> 03:14:39.231]  And materials to the Al-Qaeda insurgents, supposedly, if you even believe there's Al-Qaeda, in Iraq, was all managed by Congressman Henry Waxman.
[03:14:39.622 --> 03:14:41.463]  But it expands from there.
[03:14:41.463 --> 03:14:47.665]  We now learn that Blackwater and others were bringing arms in, in federal documents, to the insurgents.
[03:14:47.665 --> 03:14:54.587]  That they were bringing in Taliban, this is confirmed, now mainstream news, into Iraq to kill the troops.
[03:14:54.587 --> 03:15:01.229]  The British Special Forces were caught in Basra dressed up like Sunnis shooting police.
[03:15:01.229 --> 03:15:03.530]  That's Times of London confirmed.
[03:15:03.530 --> 03:15:08.612]  And so, acting like peace activists, they're actually helping get the goods in.
[03:15:09.878 --> 03:15:12.380]  To continue what's happening, is that what you're saying?
[03:15:12.380 --> 03:15:26.312]  Yeah, absolutely, because what they want is to continue destabilizing the Iraqi economy and government, and that gives us, the United States and Israel, the pretext to maintain our troop support there.
[03:15:26.312 --> 03:15:37.481]  So while we can't leave as long as the... ...Waxman is Jewish, this congressman, and he's one of the biggest backers of Israel,
[03:15:38.737 --> 03:15:48.842]  So what is he doing helping this group Code Pink, this socialist communist group, give $600,000 to the insurgents at Fallujah in Iraq?
[03:15:48.842 --> 03:15:50.083]  You get the whole deal here.
[03:15:50.083 --> 03:15:53.184]  The picture is, they're the troublemakers.
[03:15:53.184 --> 03:16:01.469]  They have to destabilize the country, and that is a pretext for American military intervention and maintaining our forces over there.
[03:16:01.469 --> 03:16:03.110]  So the whole thing is a big setup.
[03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.810]  Now, by the way,
[03:16:04.981 --> 03:16:13.531]  The third founder, in addition to Witch Starhawk, and is Jodie Evans, is a woman named Medea Benjamin.
[03:16:13.531 --> 03:16:23.563]  Now her real name is not Medea, it's Susan, but she changed it to Medea, which is the name of the Greek goddess of magic and witchcraft.
[03:16:25.185 --> 03:16:30.929]  Which I think is quite interesting, and thus again we see the witchcraft element in this code.
[03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:46.594]  Running around in the White House doing voodoo.
[03:16:46.594 --> 03:16:48.715]  I mean, is there no end to this?
[03:16:48.715 --> 03:16:52.699]  I mean, voodoo is about terrorizing people, scaring people.
[03:16:52.699 --> 03:16:57.302]  It says here that she believes she's dying even though she isn't sick.
[03:16:57.302 --> 03:17:01.225]  You know, classic voodoo superstition.
[03:17:01.225 --> 03:17:02.586]  Talk about voodoo economics.
[03:17:02.586 --> 03:17:04.808]  This is voodoo in the White House.
[03:17:05.472 --> 03:17:15.915]  Well, you're talking about the 72-year-old mother of Michelle Obama, Marianne Robinson, who evidently was practicing Santeria.
[03:17:15.915 --> 03:17:18.836]  And you're right, it is voodoo.
[03:17:18.836 --> 03:17:28.079]  And by the way, I have a picture of Obama in my upcoming video from the 1996 edition of The New Yorker.
[03:17:28.079 --> 03:17:35.161]  It pictures, you know, he was in his 30s then, Obama sitting with Michelle on their living room couch.
[03:17:35.982 --> 03:17:41.703]  She has a very close-cropped afro haircut.
[03:17:41.703 --> 03:17:46.985]  And right, it's very interesting, this whole thing was staged, this picture of the New Yorker.
[03:17:46.985 --> 03:17:59.728]  To his immediate right, on the table beside him in his living room, is a little statuette, an idol of a Santeria, basically a West African, because the Santeria
[03:18:00.481 --> 03:18:24.247]  is very big in the caribbean and cuba the caribbean islands now of course unfortunately in florida they've been given taxes in bible one c three tax exempt status of the church in america although they uh... economic rituals and knowingly land anywhere in a cruise ship now we've been on two cruises and everywhere we land they're out doing voodoo rituals when you get off and they're taking a real serious and
[03:18:25.382 --> 03:18:27.845]  And boy, look what Voodoo's done for their country.
[03:18:27.845 --> 03:18:30.948]  I mean, it just absolutely brings your country down.
[03:18:30.948 --> 03:18:31.509]  But go ahead.
[03:18:31.509 --> 03:18:32.310]  Oh, it does.
[03:18:32.310 --> 03:18:37.235]  Well, here is Obama sitting, and right beside him is a devil god.
[03:18:37.796 --> 03:18:40.278]  Well, listen, we're doing a web search on this right now.
[03:18:40.278 --> 03:18:43.361]  You said that was in the New Yorker?
[03:18:43.361 --> 03:18:43.822]  Yeah, 1996.
[03:18:58.556 --> 03:19:03.045]  Okay, 1996 New Yorker photo, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama.
[03:19:03.045 --> 03:19:06.431]  Or photo, young Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.
[03:19:06.431 --> 03:19:07.253]  That's right.
[03:19:07.253 --> 03:19:08.194]  It's interesting that this...
[03:19:08.857 --> 03:19:19.388]  That in 1996, when Americans didn't even know who Barack Obama was, the New Yorker would profile this young and up-and-coming man with his wife.
[03:19:19.388 --> 03:19:21.530]  But again, the big thing was that... We found it!
[03:19:21.530 --> 03:19:22.071]  We found it!
[03:19:22.071 --> 03:19:22.772]  We found the photo.
[03:19:22.772 --> 03:19:23.533]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[03:19:23.533 --> 03:19:24.614]  Good, good.
[03:19:24.614 --> 03:19:28.998]  Notice to his right, in fact, I believe even his arm is...
[03:19:29.719 --> 03:19:34.504]  Headed that away, and notice that they have the V there.
[03:19:34.504 --> 03:19:51.000]  Now, Nelson Mandela was a big practicer, or is a big practicer, of this religion, which is really an African-American religion that was brought over by the slaves and became big in Cuba and throughout the Caribbean.
[03:19:51.604 --> 03:19:52.445]  Alright, stay there.
[03:19:52.445 --> 03:19:55.427]  Voodoo, the new religion of the United States.
[03:19:55.427 --> 03:20:00.291]  There is a religion now in America.
[03:20:00.291 --> 03:20:00.791]  Voodoo.
[03:20:00.791 --> 03:20:02.012]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.012 --> 03:20:04.354]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776.
[03:20:04.354 --> 03:20:04.634]  However,
[03:20:06.616 --> 03:20:07.237]  We're good to go.
[03:20:28.118 --> 03:20:39.463]  Today, we have the Constitution Pride Flag to show our support for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, freedom, liberty, and justice for we the people of the United States.
[03:20:39.463 --> 03:20:43.745]  Now available at www.1787flags.com.

[03:20:50.288 --> 03:20:56.771]  www.1787flags.com, the official website of the Constitution Pride Flag.
[03:20:57.011 --> 03:21:01.394]  That's www.1787flags.com.
[03:21:01.394 --> 03:21:01.995]  Good day.
[03:21:01.995 --> 03:21:03.676]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[03:21:03.676 --> 03:21:04.056]  August 18, 2009.
[03:21:04.056 --> 03:21:05.037]  Gold opened this morning at $9.3780.
[03:21:05.037 --> 03:21:08.459]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.6472, $4.8236 for a half-ounce, or $2.4118 for the quarter-ounce.
[03:21:08.459 --> 03:21:08.960]  That's $9.6472, $4.8236, or $2.4118.
[03:21:21.108 --> 03:21:34.742]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:21:34.742 --> 03:21:43.330]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:21:43.610 --> 03:21:44.651]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:21:44.651 --> 03:21:49.015]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:21:49.015 --> 03:21:49.976]  Call for your copy.
[03:21:49.976 --> 03:21:50.116]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:50.116 --> 03:21:51.957]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:21:51.957 --> 03:21:52.198]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:52.198 --> 03:21:52.498]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.159 --> 03:22:08.203]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:08.203 --> 03:22:14.088]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:14.088 --> 03:22:20.232]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:20.572 --> 03:22:22.533]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:22.533 --> 03:22:24.995]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:22:24.995 --> 03:22:38.184]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:22:38.184 --> 03:22:39.865]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:39.865 --> 03:22:41.727]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:22:41.727 --> 03:22:47.951]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:48.610 --> 03:22:56.899]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:56.899 --> 03:22:58.461]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.461 --> 03:22:59.663]  The people strike back!
[03:23:01.943 --> 03:23:04.964]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:04.964 --> 03:23:10.286]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:10.286 --> 03:23:12.327]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:12.327 --> 03:23:17.329]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:17.329 --> 03:23:18.529]  How much do you want?
[03:23:18.529 --> 03:23:19.649]  When do you want it?
[03:23:19.649 --> 03:23:21.530]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:21.530 --> 03:23:22.610]  When will you need it?
[03:23:22.610 --> 03:23:24.811]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:24.811 --> 03:23:26.152]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:26.152 --> 03:23:26.752]  Will it make your
[03:23:26.892 --> 03:23:27.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:27.653 --> 03:23:29.794]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:29.794 --> 03:23:31.615]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:56.172 --> 03:23:56.934]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:14.833 --> 03:24:22.462]  Folks, we do have both of Texas Encyclopedics with hundreds and hundreds of photos and documents per book.
[03:24:22.462 --> 03:24:28.208]  Mysterious Monuments, Encyclopedia of Secret Illuminati Designs, Masonic Architecture and Occult Practices.
[03:24:28.208 --> 03:24:29.550]  Their language is everywhere.
[03:24:30.592 --> 03:24:37.218]  And if you want to know what's really going on, even if you're a Mason, low level, and don't know what you're a part of, this will tell you.
[03:24:37.218 --> 03:24:39.780]  Codex Magicka, same thing.
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:41.061]  Hardcore information.
[03:24:41.061 --> 03:24:44.805]  In Texas, one of the top researchers out there.
[03:24:44.805 --> 03:24:48.768]  Also, my film, combo film, two films on one DVD, 1995.
[03:24:48.768 --> 03:24:52.211]  We're going to show you some clips of it, just the video.
[03:24:53.192 --> 03:25:03.817]  Again, this local group criticized us for showing the ritual and got real mad and we got phone calls and they wrote articles for local news going, how dare you show that ritual?
[03:25:03.817 --> 03:25:04.938]  That's not what's bad.
[03:25:04.938 --> 03:25:06.838]  What's bad is their policies.
[03:25:06.838 --> 03:25:07.739]  That's not a cultic.
[03:25:07.739 --> 03:25:08.739]  There's nothing going on.
[03:25:08.739 --> 03:25:09.480]  You faked it.
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:13.021]  It's all lies, you son of a... And I was like, man, they're really mad.
[03:25:13.021 --> 03:25:20.165]  Well, then we happen to go back a few years later and find out they do a ritual every year and these people were deeply
[03:25:20.956 --> 03:25:28.980]  I mean, witch's pots, you know, literally going, in fact, you can cue it up later before Tex leaves, we'll actually find the scene.
[03:25:28.980 --> 03:25:32.322]  In fact, they're invoking spirits right there on the video.
[03:25:32.322 --> 03:25:34.023]  And they're going, give me the power!
[03:25:34.023 --> 03:25:35.304]  Oh, yes!
[03:25:35.304 --> 03:25:37.265]  And then they go, power beam!
[03:25:37.265 --> 03:25:39.466]  I mean, it's like five year olds playing like they're...
[03:25:40.379 --> 03:25:45.880]  In fact, cue it up right there where, show the warlock, the man with the beard, the Gandalf character.
[03:25:45.880 --> 03:25:50.021]  Cue it up to him when they invoke the spirits and they thank the spirits for being there.
[03:25:50.021 --> 03:25:52.982]  And there's the witch's pot.
[03:25:52.982 --> 03:25:55.663]  She plays the part of the young goddess.
[03:25:55.663 --> 03:25:57.883]  I mean, this just goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:57.883 --> 03:26:02.164]  And whatever, the issue is most CPS workers are these people.
[03:26:02.164 --> 03:26:04.165]  And they hunt Christian kids down.
[03:26:04.165 --> 03:26:05.125]  We've proven it.
[03:26:05.125 --> 03:26:06.325]  They love taking them.
[03:26:06.325 --> 03:26:08.426]  And where else can you snatch kids?
[03:26:08.426 --> 03:26:09.726]  I mean, I'm just telling you what they're into.
[03:26:10.106 --> 03:26:11.867]  Am I saying all these people are into that?
[03:26:11.867 --> 03:26:12.488]  No.
[03:26:12.488 --> 03:26:15.190]  But the point is, they always say there's none of this going on.
[03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:20.274]  The truth is, they don't want you knowing about their religion, because their religion is king in this world.
[03:26:20.274 --> 03:26:22.516]  Text Mars, please continue, sir.
[03:26:22.516 --> 03:26:29.442]  So you told us about the photo, we pulled it up, of Barack Obama with his wife, with this particular god.
[03:26:29.442 --> 03:26:36.127]  You were getting into this being an African-American religion, brought over from Africa, voodoo, spirit possession.
[03:26:36.127 --> 03:26:36.748]  Tell us what it is.
[03:26:37.486 --> 03:26:46.333]  Okay, now, when we look at Santorini, it comes from West Africa, from Nigeria, from the Congo, and slaves brought it back.
[03:26:46.333 --> 03:26:52.537]  And it really, you know, took over Havana, Cuba, throughout the Caribbean.
[03:26:52.537 --> 03:27:00.644]  And by the way, there is a church given official status in the United States, and there was a little problem with it because they wanted to, and they do,
[03:27:01.244 --> 03:27:16.378]  They actually, to this very day, it is now legal for this church, according to the Supreme Court, the Church of Babalui, the Church of Babalui, which is a Santeria church, worship of God, demons,
[03:27:17.228 --> 03:27:38.613]  And they sacrificed chickens, goats, some say cats and dogs, and in one case, up in New York State, they actually sacrificed a young girl, a young beautiful cheerleader, 17 year old, put a plastic bag over her head, and had a Santeria demonic exorcism for her, of course she ended up dead.
[03:27:39.528 --> 03:27:53.673]  So this is a very dangerous religion, but when you begin to sacrifice chickens and goats and they use the blood for various things, they also use the menstrual blood of women and mix it with some kind of evil potion.
[03:27:53.673 --> 03:28:04.958]  By the way, Abu Ghraib, as you know, but also at Camp X-Ray, they let the CIA interrogators practice raping the Muslim men with menstruating women to freak them out.
[03:28:04.958 --> 03:28:08.119]  But notice it's always an excuse to really just do their ritual.
[03:28:09.111 --> 03:28:09.671]  Absolutely.
[03:28:09.671 --> 03:28:11.612]  Now, here's an interesting thing.
[03:28:11.612 --> 03:28:17.395]  You know, I did some research some time ago of this Trinity United Church of Christ.
[03:28:17.395 --> 03:28:22.218]  A member of Obama was a member there for 20 years, Dr. Jeremiah Wright.
[03:28:22.218 --> 03:28:26.580]  If you go online, you can still get, I checked it out today right before this program,
[03:28:27.441 --> 03:28:29.262]  They actually have About Us.
[03:28:29.262 --> 03:28:31.963]  Trinity United Church of Christ Chicago.
[03:28:31.963 --> 03:28:33.764]  There's a section called About Us.
[03:28:33.764 --> 03:28:35.704]  I want to read to you the very first line.
[03:28:35.704 --> 03:28:38.205]  This is what his church was all about.
[03:28:38.205 --> 03:28:39.886]  He cannot say he did not know this.
[03:28:39.886 --> 03:28:44.088]  This is their official statement of beliefs and doctrines.
[03:28:44.088 --> 03:28:45.869]  Every church has this.
[03:28:45.869 --> 03:28:52.992]  It says, we are a congregation, which, and I'm going to get back to this voodoo Santeria from this, Alex.
[03:28:52.992 --> 03:28:56.453]  It says, we are a congregation which is unashamedly black.
[03:28:58.030 --> 03:29:09.939]  It says, we are an African people and remain true to our native land, the Mother Continent, the cradle of civilization.
[03:29:09.939 --> 03:29:13.521]  This is amazing!
[03:29:13.521 --> 03:29:23.008]  Here is a church dedicated to African tribalism ritual, the Mother Continent.
[03:29:23.008 --> 03:29:27.071]  Yeah, it's a front for a voodoo cult, no doubt about that.
[03:29:27.884 --> 03:29:33.109]  There's not one mention of Jesus Christ in the entire... They have a value system.
[03:29:33.109 --> 03:29:35.451]  They have 12 things we believe in.
[03:29:35.451 --> 03:29:38.273]  Not one thing relates to Jesus Christ.
[03:29:38.273 --> 03:29:38.473]  Not one.
[03:29:38.473 --> 03:29:39.875]  We're gonna go there during the break.
[03:29:39.875 --> 03:29:42.177]  Tex, tell my producers, and they're doing a great job.
[03:29:42.177 --> 03:29:45.199]  Producers, directors, camera guys are doing the whole show.
[03:29:45.199 --> 03:29:48.943]  Tell Jaron and Paul, during the break, the URL.
[03:29:48.943 --> 03:29:51.865]  We're gonna show it to people when we get back.
[03:29:51.865 --> 03:29:53.246]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.246 --> 03:29:54.768]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.753 --> 03:29:58.472]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.496 --> 03:30:06.459]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:30:31.516 --> 03:30:32.136]  We're good.
[03:31:01.121 --> 03:31:02.503]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:31:02.503 --> 03:31:04.505]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:31:04.505 --> 03:31:05.486]  Well, you should.
[03:31:05.486 --> 03:31:09.991]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:31:09.991 --> 03:31:10.792]  That's right.

[03:31:22.145 --> 03:31:28.133]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:31:28.133 --> 03:31:35.042]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:31:35.042 --> 03:31:40.229]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[03:32:01.725 --> 03:32:05.469]  ...MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:32:05.469 --> 03:32:08.031]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:32:08.031 --> 03:32:17.500]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:32:17.700 --> 03:32:23.902]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:32:23.902 --> 03:32:26.602]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:32:26.602 --> 03:32:36.725]  So, MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[03:32:36.725 --> 03:32:47.087]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[03:32:47.267 --> 03:32:51.309]  Visit www.chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[03:32:51.309 --> 03:32:54.291]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:32:54.291 --> 03:32:58.073]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:32:58.073 --> 03:33:00.554]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:33:07.935 --> 03:33:12.116]  By the way, I was talking to Rob out during the break and he goes, Alex, don't you remember?
[03:33:12.116 --> 03:33:17.097]  Tarpley's unauthorized biography has Reverend Wright doing voodoo rituals on Halloween night every year.
[03:33:34.761 --> 03:33:40.045]  And I forgot Tarpley said that like a year ago, and that's when I was like, Tarpley, you're nuts.
[03:33:40.045 --> 03:33:44.908]  Because even though I know all this stuff, or a lot of it, I still can't believe it.
[03:33:44.908 --> 03:33:50.953]  And so Rob's out there flipping through the book, finding the part for me, because I don't remember where it is in the book, to highlight it.
[03:33:50.953 --> 03:33:52.754]  We'll show you that.
[03:33:52.754 --> 03:33:57.717]  But Tex, during the break you were telling me to flip to a page of Mysterious Monuments.
[03:33:57.717 --> 03:33:59.219]  What was it, page 386 you said?
[03:33:59.219 --> 03:33:59.999]  Yeah, page 386.
[03:34:02.356 --> 03:34:14.764]  You know, these people, they mix all of this magic stuff and Santeria African-American religion, black theology, you know, the black liberation theology.
[03:34:14.764 --> 03:34:24.470]  But here is a news item from USA Today, an actual picture from page 386 of my own book, Mysterious Monument, that you offer folks there.
[03:34:24.470 --> 03:34:27.112]  And, you know, people say, which is in Washington, D.C.? ?
[03:34:28.092 --> 03:34:34.854]  Doing a ritual to cleanse the White House in preparation for Obama taking over.
[03:34:34.854 --> 03:34:36.495]  But look at this one.
[03:34:36.495 --> 03:34:39.356]  This is from the USA Today newspaper.
[03:34:39.356 --> 03:34:40.376]  And it shows these witches.
[03:34:40.376 --> 03:34:41.496]  Now, they do this every year.
[03:34:41.496 --> 03:34:49.799]  They're scheduled this September to go back again for their, I think it's their 18th annual prayer vigil.
[03:34:49.799 --> 03:34:57.021]  Now, notice it's exactly 33 hours, Alex, because 33 is the highest ritual number of
[03:34:57.662 --> 03:35:00.243]  Freemasonry, Scottish Rite Freemasonry, 33.
[03:35:00.243 --> 03:35:06.284]  33 just happens to be the age in which Jesus Christ was slain on the cross.
[03:35:06.284 --> 03:35:12.325]  And there are other various satanic reasons that they honor in numerology the number 33.
[03:35:12.325 --> 03:35:26.248]  But notice they're doing a circle witchcraft ritual around, what else, but the obelisk, which is the phallus of the sun god in ancient mystery religion symbology.
[03:35:26.248 --> 03:35:27.368]  So they're worshiping the
[03:35:28.479 --> 03:35:34.620]  Dare I say it, the sex organ of the Sun God.
[03:35:34.620 --> 03:35:38.801]  And this is in Washington, D.C.
[03:35:38.801 --> 03:35:45.842]  I would not be surprised if Code Pink was there with the witch Starhawk, one of their founders.
[03:35:45.842 --> 03:35:53.344]  But Alex, back to this United Church of Christ, this Trinity United Church of Christ.
[03:35:53.612 --> 03:35:55.033]  Yeah, in fact, we have their website.
[03:35:55.033 --> 03:35:57.035]  Here it is, exactly as you said.
[03:35:57.035 --> 03:36:00.999]  It's an African Spiritual Center for Voodoo.
[03:36:00.999 --> 03:36:02.580]  They just basically admit it right there.
[03:36:02.580 --> 03:36:08.866]  Now, one of the things that this Dr. Jeremiah Wright teaches is black liberation theology.
[03:36:09.702 --> 03:36:16.407]  And a textbook that he uses is from Professor James Cone, Harvard University.
[03:36:16.407 --> 03:36:23.512]  Now, that's Barack Obama's alma mater, the same place where Professor Gates comes from.
[03:36:23.512 --> 03:36:32.238]  Now, Professor Cone wrote the primal textbook entitled, A Black Theology of Liberation.
[03:36:32.238 --> 03:36:38.482]  And on page 62 is an amazing quote, Alex, I'd like to read because it'll explain a lot.
[03:36:38.482 --> 03:36:39.023]  It says,
[03:36:39.847 --> 03:37:01.083]  The goal of black theology, now remember this is what was taught all 20 years at this church that Obama went to, the goal of black theology is the destruction of everything white so that blacks can be liberated from alien gods.
[03:37:01.083 --> 03:37:03.605]  Now alien gods would be Jesus Christ,
[03:37:05.123 --> 03:37:07.224]  He's an alien god of the white man!
[03:37:07.224 --> 03:37:29.429]  But I'll tell you this, I've discovered in writings, and I'm sure I've never really seen anything that I'm aware of that Texas isn't already aware of, or very rarely so, that actually the white supremacist a hundred years ago, the eugenicist, said if we can't ship all the blacks back to Africa, we'll fund a black liberation movement to balkanize them and to make them not want to intermarry with anybody but blacks.
[03:37:30.029 --> 03:37:34.470]  And you see today that a lot of blacks don't want black babies adopted out to anybody else.
[03:37:34.470 --> 03:37:36.130]  Let them stay in institutions.
[03:37:36.130 --> 03:37:38.071]  Don't marry anybody but a black person.
[03:37:38.071 --> 03:37:40.331]  The white supremacists actually like that.
[03:37:40.331 --> 03:37:44.372]  So this is a very, very slick system for the eugenicists.
[03:37:44.372 --> 03:37:55.335]  If they can't kill the blacks off, they'll at least fund and finance the most destructive things of African culture, like voodoo, and get them to have it part of their culture to only stay with each other.
[03:37:55.715 --> 03:37:57.976]  And that's Black's right if they want to do that.
[03:37:57.976 --> 03:38:00.538]  I'm just saying the big foundations funded that.
[03:38:00.538 --> 03:38:02.419]  Were you aware of that, Tex?
[03:38:02.419 --> 03:38:02.959]  Yes, I am.
[03:38:02.959 --> 03:38:07.301]  In fact, even the Communist Party USA promoted that very idea.
[03:38:07.301 --> 03:38:12.604]  Gus Hall, you know, one of the top guys there for 17 years, the president of it.
[03:38:12.604 --> 03:38:18.427]  One of his main things was to reach out and bring blacks into the Communist Party.
[03:38:18.427 --> 03:38:23.150]  And thus, the reason why Frank Marshall Davis, who was Barack Obama's mentor,
[03:38:24.506 --> 03:38:35.329]  Uh, over in, uh, you know, Hawaii, he was a member of the Communist Party USA, so there has been this communist, socialist, uh, African, uh, religion thing.
[03:38:35.329 --> 03:38:47.512]  By the way, this, this Trinity United Church of Christ, in their statement of beliefs, they call it the, the, the black, uh, let's see what it's called, oh yeah, black value system.
[03:38:48.211 --> 03:38:54.055]  Number eight is very interesting, and I think you've got it right there yourself on the internet.
[03:38:54.055 --> 03:38:59.899]  It's the disavowal of the pursuit of middle classedness.
[03:38:59.899 --> 03:39:02.981]  In other words, they want to stay blacks.
[03:39:02.981 --> 03:39:06.444]  They want to stay victims forever.
[03:39:06.444 --> 03:39:09.686]  They say, we will not pursue being part of the middle class.
[03:39:10.305 --> 03:39:21.892]  Well, notice they tell white yuppies, homogenize, give up your class, because they see that as the dominant group, and then the other groups, they want them balkanized so they can play us off against each other.
[03:39:21.892 --> 03:39:22.493]  Absolutely.
[03:39:22.493 --> 03:39:23.313]  This is the whole thing.
[03:39:23.313 --> 03:39:29.898]  They want blacks to stay away from the middle class because
[03:39:31.893 --> 03:39:41.740]  In other words, if we can stay to ourselves, stay a slave race, and then of course we'll be warriors against everything white.
[03:39:41.740 --> 03:39:47.144]  Their black theology, liberation theology, is the destruction of everything white.
[03:39:47.144 --> 03:39:53.589]  Now why is it that the liberal left-wing press in America, NBC, ABC, CBS News, CNN,
[03:39:54.429 --> 03:40:01.576]  Why aren't they concerned about such a blatant racism on the part of this church?
[03:40:01.576 --> 03:40:02.517]  Well, let me just stop you.
[03:40:02.517 --> 03:40:07.803]  I'm reading Tarpley's book here, trying to... I read it and remember, but I'm trying to find the part.
[03:40:07.803 --> 03:40:12.047]  Ian Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography that we have available at InfoWars.com.
[03:40:12.047 --> 03:40:14.709]  Just totally separately, he's a historian backing you up.
[03:40:15.946 --> 03:40:28.771]  He just is reporting the facts about voodoo rituals at the church, about the Trilateral Commission funding Jeremiah Wright, and how they control these communities in the big cities through these groups.
[03:40:28.771 --> 03:40:30.252]  So, just amazing text.
[03:40:30.839 --> 03:40:31.139]  It is.
[03:40:31.139 --> 03:40:41.626]  Now, another element that's part of this, this anti-Christianity, is the Freemasonry, the secret society known as Freemasonry.
[03:40:41.626 --> 03:40:53.815]  And in fact, I have an ad, I'm looking at it here, the Masons actually had a Masonic inaugural ball for the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama.
[03:40:54.651 --> 03:40:56.453]  Sponsored by the Washington, D.C.
[03:40:56.453 --> 03:40:57.173]  Lodge No.
[03:40:57.173 --> 03:40:57.494]  7.
[03:40:57.494 --> 03:40:58.695]  I think that's interesting.
[03:40:58.695 --> 03:41:02.918]  Of course, Barack Obama is reputedly a member of the Prince Hall Masons.
[03:41:02.918 --> 03:41:05.400]  That's the Black Masons.
[03:41:05.400 --> 03:41:08.423]  And it's interesting here again, the Masonic Lodge...
[03:41:09.896 --> 03:41:18.782]  Uh, has, has purposely created a black, a segregated black Masonic group called the Prince Hall Masons.
[03:41:18.782 --> 03:41:22.704]  And every well-known black leader is a member of it.
[03:41:22.704 --> 03:41:26.626]  Uh, Reverend Al Sharpton, yep, he's a Mason.
[03:41:26.626 --> 03:41:29.528]  Jesse Jackson, you better believe it, he is a Mason.
[03:41:32.304 --> 03:41:35.605]  What's the guy at the head of the NAACP, Andrew Young?
[03:41:35.605 --> 03:41:37.986]  He's a Mason, a former head.
[03:41:37.986 --> 03:41:43.868]  So, all of the top, from Jesse Jackson to Barack Obama, they're all high-level Masons.
[03:41:43.868 --> 03:41:52.652]  In fact, even Louis Farrakhan of the Black Muslims, he is also a 33rd degree Prince Hall Mason.
[03:41:52.652 --> 03:41:59.854]  So, the Masonic thing, and of course, they literally worship this ancient mystery religion god.
[03:41:59.854 --> 03:42:01.355]  His name is Jaboulon.
[03:42:02.338 --> 03:42:20.015]  So, you see where everything comes together with these pagan mystery religions, whether it's Code Pink, whether it's Trinity United Church of Christ, that Obama went to, whether it's the Freemasons, whether it's the Santeria religion of Michelle Obama's mother,
[03:42:21.356 --> 03:42:22.457]  The 72-year-old Marion Robinson.
[03:42:22.457 --> 03:42:26.918]  And notice, Tex, I want you to finish that key point, but they always want to keep it secret.
[03:42:26.918 --> 03:42:29.079]  That the devil's biggest trick is denying he exists.
[03:42:29.079 --> 03:42:31.619]  They always want to deny they're sacrificing people.
[03:42:31.619 --> 03:42:41.703]  When every one of these cults did this, whether it was the Aztecs, or Northern Europeans, or Central Asian cults, or African cults, they all sacrificed people.
[03:42:41.703 --> 03:42:45.824]  Why, through all the anthropology of the world and its whole history,
[03:42:46.404 --> 03:42:49.187]  of man, do you see these devil cults?
[03:42:49.187 --> 03:42:50.528]  What is the point?
[03:42:50.528 --> 03:42:52.549]  Why does this keep reoccurring?
[03:42:52.549 --> 03:43:00.776]  Looking at it as a professor, I understand you're saying it's religious, it's good, it's evil, but atheists will say this isn't even going on.
[03:43:00.776 --> 03:43:05.400]  They can only identify Christianity and say it's quaint and old-fashioned and stupid.
[03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:14.128]  But they love all the other religions, as the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment Treaty of 96 says, we will reintroduce the pagan cults
[03:43:14.608 --> 03:43:20.551]  of human sacrifice and of killing humans for the earth, this will be our new world religion.
[03:43:20.551 --> 03:43:27.234]  There is, you know, and I must go back to religion because in the Old Testament there is something very interesting.
[03:43:27.234 --> 03:43:35.678]  No, but that's what I'm saying, Tex, is that yes, we're Christians, but I'm saying the atheists will deny this exists just from a anthropology view.
[03:43:35.678 --> 03:43:36.579]  What are they hiding?
[03:43:36.579 --> 03:43:36.899]  Go ahead.
[03:43:37.760 --> 03:44:03.672]  That's silly for them because the history of the world, and of course there are many, many groups in America now trying to return America to the Mexican pre-history days of the Aztecs, the Incas, and horrible, I call it witchcraft, basically human sacrifice again at the pyramids down in Mexico and Mesoamerica.
[03:44:05.032 --> 03:44:07.014]  This is very, very strong.
[03:44:07.014 --> 03:44:15.719]  People believe that this is a fringe group, but in actuality, Wicca and all of this Santeria stuff, this is huge.
[03:44:15.719 --> 03:44:19.081]  This is one of the fastest growing religions in the world.
[03:44:19.081 --> 03:44:27.125]  And it all works together, and they will even practice to deceive Christians.
[03:44:27.125 --> 03:44:31.268]  They'll try to bring, for example, one of the Santeria goddesses
[03:44:34.412 --> 03:44:51.039]  Uh, is, is called, uh, Ocean, uh, let's see, I think she's called, yeah, uh, Bamiya, Bamiya, which really is Mother Mary of Christianity, with all the trappings, though, of these demon gods of Santeria.
[03:44:51.039 --> 03:44:56.081]  So, this is how they try to even, you know, uh, pollute, uh, uh, Christianity.
[03:44:56.081 --> 03:44:57.922]  Uh, and this is well known, uh, as well.
[03:44:58.660 --> 03:45:11.431]  But I want to emphasize that many blacks are falling for this today because originally this came from Africa, from the Congo, from West Africa, from Nigeria.
[03:45:11.431 --> 03:45:14.614]  So we have a huge contingent of these foreigners.
[03:45:14.614 --> 03:45:17.957]  I mean, this is the ultimate, Alex, in multiculturalism, isn't it?
[03:45:19.611 --> 03:45:41.652]  Well, it certainly is, Tex, and I'm trying to pull Webster Tarpley up live on air right now because I wanted to get him, because the show's almost over here, I wanted to get him to comment on what is in his book, page 8, about Obama himself is much more likely a Satanist of the apostate Jeremiah Wright
[03:45:43.536 --> 03:45:52.880]  Liberation Theology School, a Christian heresy which places racial hatred instead of charity, the center of its edifice of faith.
[03:45:52.880 --> 03:45:55.742]  Wright is ultimately the high priest of a death cult.
[03:45:55.742 --> 03:46:03.305]  Obama is more precisely an, uh, existentialist fascist made up of equal parts 1969 Weatherman race war theory
[03:46:05.166 --> 03:46:12.473]  And it just goes on to then talk about the bizarre voodoo stuff basically going on there at Wright's Church.
[03:46:12.473 --> 03:46:20.561]  So I just thought this was interesting that Tarpley wrote this book a year ago that we carry at InfoWars.com and here it is manifesting in the news.
[03:46:20.561 --> 03:46:21.842]  It's just incredible.
[03:46:21.842 --> 03:46:23.144]  Please continue with your comments.
[03:46:23.643 --> 03:46:26.305]  Well, I think that is interesting, those comments about Tarpaulin.
[03:46:26.305 --> 03:46:29.087]  I think he had quite a bit of insight.
[03:46:29.087 --> 03:46:32.550]  Now, here's another little parade that we can go by.
[03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:40.356]  Abner Mikva, who is a well-known Jewish lawyer out of Chicago, he was White House counsel, now.
[03:46:40.356 --> 03:46:46.700]  Here's a powerful man, White House counsel, the top lawyer for Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky hearings.
[03:46:46.700 --> 03:46:48.422]  But he was a big, and he is a big,
[03:46:49.102 --> 03:46:53.043]  Mentor and supporter for many years of Barack Obama.
[03:46:53.043 --> 03:47:08.668]  He said, and this is in the Chicago Tribune, back at chicagotribune.com, so we're talking about Chicago's biggest newspaper, and there was an article entitled, Barack Obama, America's First Jewish President.
[03:47:09.434 --> 03:47:15.939]  And it was because of his support from these millionaire and billionaire Jews from Chicago and overseas.
[03:47:15.939 --> 03:47:31.010]  But Mikva, who was one of the supporters, said that as a young man, an aspiring young politician, young Barack Obama came to him, now remember this is the Chicago Tribune, and said, how can I best get ahead in politics?
[03:47:31.010 --> 03:47:36.594]  And Mikva, who is Jewish, said to him, the first thing you need to do, Barack,
[03:47:37.233 --> 03:47:42.315]  is to go and join a powerful black church.
[03:47:42.315 --> 03:47:49.018]  You need a power base, and the way to do it is to go join a big black church.
[03:47:49.018 --> 03:47:52.180]  Okay, Tex, we're gonna take you into the final segment here.
[03:47:52.180 --> 03:47:53.040]  The show is almost over.
[03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:55.941]  We're gonna have to have a part two on this because it's so important.
[03:47:55.941 --> 03:47:59.463]  Just for a minute and a half, Tarpley, because the show is about to end here,
[03:48:00.123 --> 03:48:00.323]  I don't
[03:48:20.430 --> 03:48:27.012]  Jeremiah Wright's church, and now it's mainstream news they're doing voodoo rituals in the White House.
[03:48:27.012 --> 03:48:31.554]  Obama comments on, Tarpley comments on this Obama situation.
[03:48:31.554 --> 03:48:42.477]  Well what I was trying to get at in that book, Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, is simply the question of, is it possible to come to Christ through Jeremiah Wright?
[03:48:42.477 --> 03:48:47.819]  Because that is what Obama asserts, is that I came to Jesus Christ through Jeremiah Wright.
[03:48:47.819 --> 03:48:48.619]  Now I would argue
[03:48:49.358 --> 03:48:57.725]  This is not easy to do, because if you look at Jeremiah Wright, this is essentially a minority, radical school of theology.
[03:48:57.725 --> 03:49:11.456]  It's the so-called Black Liberation Theology, set up by a fellow called James Cone, and some others, which essentially says that the entire Christian story is limited to one ethnic group.
[03:49:11.456 --> 03:49:18.762]  And if you're not, then you're not part of that ethnic group, then you're not part of the... So it's a fundamental attack on Christianity?
[03:49:19.222 --> 03:49:23.424]  No, I don't know anything about that part, but what you see from Cohn is he says that the purpose, the task of God and of Christ
[03:49:39.895 --> 03:49:50.938]  Is to assist in the suppression of the white population of the world, which I think makes it, therefore, into a religion of hatred, in effect.
[03:49:50.938 --> 03:49:54.479]  And I believe this is all subsidized by the foundations.
[03:49:54.479 --> 03:49:57.080]  This is a theology of counterinsurgency.
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:02.041]  The goal is to pit white against black, and indeed other groups in this country, all against themselves.
[03:50:02.461 --> 03:50:06.982]  So the bankers in Wall Street never experience a direct challenge to their rule.
[03:50:06.982 --> 03:50:15.465]  And I think that's why the foundations pay, right, and pay people like Dwight Hopkins and that church and indeed Cohen, right?
[03:50:15.465 --> 03:50:18.626]  So it's all balkanization, it's all balkanization.
[03:50:18.626 --> 03:50:20.267]  Webster, thanks for popping in with us.
[03:50:20.267 --> 03:50:22.167]  I just wanted to get you to comment on your book.
[03:50:22.167 --> 03:50:22.687]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:50:22.687 --> 03:50:23.347]  Thank you.
[03:50:23.347 --> 03:50:23.948]  Thank you.
[03:50:23.948 --> 03:50:31.270]  Going back to Tex, we've got a few minutes on the other side, but basically he's saying the same thing you're saying, Tex, from a completely different political angle.
[03:50:32.339 --> 03:50:33.420]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:50:33.420 --> 03:50:40.044]  So, we can't say that the United Church of Christ, or the Trinity United Church of Christ, is a voodoo Santeria church.
[03:50:40.044 --> 03:50:47.469]  But we can say that it is based on paganism, African tribalism, and really a worship of the black race.
[03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:49.170]  It is a racist church.
[03:50:49.170 --> 03:50:52.372]  But they do do weird things on Halloween there, actually.
[03:50:52.372 --> 03:50:54.894]  I've heard that, too.
[03:50:54.894 --> 03:51:01.418]  And of course, they don't have any problem in bringing in the Catholic priest, but then Louie Sterricon is one of them.
[03:51:01.758 --> 03:51:03.060]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:03.060 --> 03:51:08.648]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:51:08.648 --> 03:51:13.675]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:51:13.675 --> 03:51:18.702]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:51:19.242 --> 03:51:24.466]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:51:24.466 --> 03:51:26.767]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:51:26.767 --> 03:51:31.570]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:51:31.570 --> 03:51:32.691]  And here's the best part.
[03:51:32.691 --> 03:51:35.453]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:51:35.453 --> 03:51:39.396]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:51:39.396 --> 03:51:42.578]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:51:42.578 --> 03:51:44.799]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:51:44.799 --> 03:51:45.720]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:51:49.363 --> 03:51:53.607]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:51:53.607 --> 03:51:58.432]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:51:58.432 --> 03:52:00.815]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:52:02.193 --> 03:52:07.997]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.997 --> 03:52:15.561]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.561 --> 03:52:21.725]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.165 --> 03:52:24.127]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.127 --> 03:52:26.629]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:26.629 --> 03:52:38.217]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.217 --> 03:52:39.899]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.899 --> 03:52:41.760]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:48.005]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.647 --> 03:52:56.916]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.916 --> 03:52:58.498]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.498 --> 03:53:01.902]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.902 --> 03:53:06.908]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[03:53:09.565 --> 03:53:10.165]  We're good to go!
[03:53:32.619 --> 03:53:32.919]  We're good.
[03:54:07.659 --> 03:54:09.561]  It's always great having Tex on with us.
[03:54:09.561 --> 03:54:11.983]  We'll have him back on again in the near future.
[03:54:11.983 --> 03:54:13.064]  We've got a few minutes left with him.
[03:54:13.064 --> 03:54:18.389]  I do want to tell you about a few of the sponsors before we have to end this show.
[03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:20.251]  FrontSight.com.
[03:54:20.251 --> 03:54:21.332]  FrontSight.
[03:54:21.332 --> 03:54:27.357]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com is the premier firearms training facility in the country.
[03:54:28.298 --> 03:54:30.841]  And it's the biggest, and it's the least expensive.
[03:54:30.841 --> 03:54:33.023]  That's why they're the biggest and the best.
[03:54:33.023 --> 03:54:40.191]  They give you a free XD pistol with your 5-day firearms course and a 30-day state concealed weapons permit.
[03:54:40.191 --> 03:54:42.613]  And the course is 75% off out of the gates.
[03:54:42.613 --> 03:54:44.495]  It's filling up quickly in the fall.
[03:54:44.495 --> 03:54:45.616]  It's out in Pahrump, Nevada.
[03:54:46.437 --> 03:54:51.440]  They have a lot of free courses and tips and free newsletter at FrontSite.com.
[03:54:51.440 --> 03:54:54.002]  Go check this deal out.
[03:54:54.002 --> 03:54:56.984]  No drill instructor or boot camp attitude.
[03:54:56.984 --> 03:54:58.325]  It's family.
[03:54:58.325 --> 03:55:02.027]  They got all sorts of courses for handguns, shotguns, rifles, you name it.
[03:55:02.027 --> 03:55:04.709]  FrontSite.com, FrontSite.com.
[03:55:04.709 --> 03:55:07.351]  And lastly, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:55:07.351 --> 03:55:13.555]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[03:55:13.555 --> 03:55:16.117]  Yeah, the hybrid seeds don't produce seeds anymore, seeds that grow.
[03:55:16.738 --> 03:55:23.409]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds are the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[03:55:23.409 --> 03:55:27.977]  The globalists are buying up seed companies, building big seed banks, hoarding them at the Arctic Circle.
[03:55:29.338 --> 03:55:32.899]  Seeds on the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.

[03:55:40.602 --> 03:55:40.902]  Great folks.
[03:55:40.902 --> 03:55:41.362]  Get involved today.
[03:55:41.362 --> 03:55:41.822]  All right, Tex.
[03:55:41.822 --> 03:55:42.482]  Amazing interview.
[03:55:42.482 --> 03:55:44.103]  I appreciate you coming on on short notice.
[03:55:54.787 --> 03:56:00.514]  I can't imagine just at a base level looking at Haiti, looking at Cuba, looking at Nigeria.
[03:56:00.514 --> 03:56:04.178]  Voodoo is a horrible demon possession religion.
[03:56:04.178 --> 03:56:10.546]  Even if you don't believe in demons, the mental illness, the self-invoking mental illness of going crazy
[03:56:11.227 --> 03:56:16.869]  And on all the superstition, it turns out Obama's mother-in-law thinks somebody's put a hex on her.
[03:56:16.869 --> 03:56:26.233]  I mean, this is sewage in the streets, chickens running around, medicine men, all this... It's a black magic religion.
[03:56:26.233 --> 03:56:28.034]  I mean, I couldn't think of something more degenerate.
[03:56:28.909 --> 03:56:30.631]  Well, it is degenerate.
[03:56:30.631 --> 03:56:33.313]  And unfortunately, it's a very dangerous religion.
[03:56:33.313 --> 03:56:42.101]  And as I mentioned, there are people who have been murdered through ritual conducted by the Santeria people.
[03:56:42.101 --> 03:56:50.148]  Not to even mention the horror of animals, you know, dogs, cats, and particularly chickens and goats and all of these things.
[03:56:50.148 --> 03:56:53.631]  So, I think... What about the charms Obama carries?
[03:56:54.531 --> 03:56:58.695]  The charms, the talismans, all of these things are involved in every way.
[03:56:58.695 --> 03:57:03.499]  This African tribalism, and unfortunately it is taking hold.
[03:57:03.499 --> 03:57:05.361]  It's been in America for a long time.
[03:57:05.361 --> 03:57:17.212]  You remember even Desi Ornez, who is very unfortunate, the most lovable guy in the world, on I Love Lucy, but he would always play his drums and he would cry out, Babaluwa!
[03:57:17.212 --> 03:57:20.475]  That's the name of one of the Orishas, the gods.
[03:57:21.583 --> 03:57:23.145]  Uh, of Santeria.
[03:57:23.145 --> 03:57:24.846]  He was calling on the devil god.
[03:57:24.846 --> 03:57:33.613]  Uh, and biographers have shown that Desi Ornez was an alcoholic, and he attempted to get Lucille Ball into a form of satanic worship.
[03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:46.803]  So again, we have a long train of this, but now we have a man in the White House whose mother-in-law actually has conducted, evidently, according to reports, a voodoo ritual.
[03:57:46.803 --> 03:57:48.004]  That's basically what it is.
[03:57:48.004 --> 03:57:51.588]  All those Santerios say, oh, we're not voodooists, but they are.
[03:57:51.588 --> 03:57:55.272]  Spirits, devils, talismans, charms in the White House.
[03:57:56.477 --> 03:57:59.518]  All right, Tex, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:57:59.518 --> 03:58:11.922]  I hope folks will get Mysterious Monuments, and of course, Codex Magic of Both, and all your other great books and videos and films at InfoWars.com or TexMars.com, ThePowerOfProphecy.com.
[03:58:11.922 --> 03:58:13.463]  Tex, thank you so much.
[03:58:13.463 --> 03:58:17.904]  Have a great week, and say hi to Wanda and the rest of the Power of Prophecy crew.
[03:58:17.904 --> 03:58:18.964]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[03:58:18.964 --> 03:58:20.185]  All the best to you and your audience.
[03:58:20.185 --> 03:58:20.585]  God bless.
[03:58:20.845 --> 03:58:22.626]  God bless you, take care.
[03:58:22.626 --> 03:58:31.129]  All right ladies and gentlemen, retransmission jam-packed with tons of news and info on Dr. Blaylock on the forced flu vaccine and what it really does to you.
